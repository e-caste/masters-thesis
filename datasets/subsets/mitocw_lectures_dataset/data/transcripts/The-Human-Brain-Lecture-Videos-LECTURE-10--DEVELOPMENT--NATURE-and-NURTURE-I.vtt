[DIGITAL EFFECTS]

00:00:10.978 --> 00:00:13.250
NANCY KANWISHER: So
let's start with one

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:16.880
of the deepest questions humans
have ever asked themselves.

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.700
We're not messing around in
this class; we're going for it.

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.530
And one of the
deepest questions is,

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:23.870
where does knowledge come from?

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:27.230
And as you'll know, if
you've taken even a teeny bit

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.600
of philosophy or read
even a teeny bit,

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.119
you know that some of the
classic views in Western

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:35.630
philosophy-- especially the
empiricists, Locke and Hume--

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:41.420
argue that all knowledge
comes from experience, right?

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.430
On the other hand,
there are a number

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.820
of other schools of thought in
Western philosophy, of which

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.070
a dominant figure is
Immanuel Kant, who

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.990
argued that experience
alone is not enough.

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:55.670
You can't just have experience
and figure out all the stuff

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.140
we have figured out.

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.960
And so he argued that there
has to be what he called

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.260
"a priori conditions"
of cognition, which

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.420
can't be derived from
experience themselves,

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.930
but have to be given
prior to it, OK?

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.330
So you have to have to build
some structure into a mind

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.100
or brain to get
it off the ground.

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.020
You can't just start
with absolutely nothing

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:16.990
and get anywhere.

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.890
OK, and he also argued that
one of the key elements of this

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.830
a priori structure that
you have to build in

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:27.240
was space and time--

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.090
organizing principles of
cognition and thinking.

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:33.640
And so in his
version of it, space

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.240
is nothing but the form of all
appearances of outer sense,

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.380
and it can be given prior to
all actual perceptions and so

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.800
exist in the mind a
priori, and can contain,

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.860
prior to all experience,
principles which determine

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.840
the relations of these objects.

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:57.230
OK, well, is that just
empty philosophical hot air?

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:59.480
It's kind of hard to understand
exactly what he means.

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.420
You're actually have to go
spend a good deal of time

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.390
with reading him to
make any sense of it--

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.690
or cheat and get your
friends to tell you, as I do.

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.800
But no, I'll argue it's not just
empty philosophical hot air--

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.840
that these are, in
some important sense,

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.375
empirical questions.

00:02:16.375 --> 00:02:17.750
And there are
empirical questions

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.770
that our field
addresses very directly.

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:23.450
And so on Wednesday,
we'll talk about

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.500
whether your representations of
space in your head are innate

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:28.100
or not.

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.340
It's pretty much directly
what Kant is talking about--

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.590
or the modern version of
what he was talking about.

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.840
And today, we'll talk about
which aspects of the brain

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.360
are innate and which
our learned, OK?

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:39.950
That's the agenda.

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.728
OK, so this little kind of
Easter egg brain here very

00:02:44.728 --> 00:02:46.520
schematically shows
you some of the regions

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.312
that we've been talking
about in this class

00:02:48.312 --> 00:02:51.020
so far, with regions that
are, to varying degrees,

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.290
specialized for processing
things like shape, and color,

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.590
and motion, and faces,
and places, and bodies--

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.440
visually processing all of
these things in approximately

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.420
those locations.

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:05.030
And as I've mentioned,
these regions

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.610
are present in approximately
the same location--

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:09.830
with some individual
variability-- in pretty

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:11.958
much every normal person.

00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:14.000
One of my lab members
says, you keep saying that,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.860
and it's just not true.

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:16.140
There's some percent
of subjects who

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:17.290
just don't show these things.

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:18.248
He's kind of right, OK.

00:03:18.248 --> 00:03:21.307
So maybe, I don't know,
5%, 10% of subjects,

00:03:21.307 --> 00:03:22.890
you wouldn't see
some of these things.

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:24.807
And we've never actually
done the serious work

00:03:24.807 --> 00:03:27.600
of bringing those subjects back,
scanning the hell out of them,

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.100
and finding out whether they
were just asleep in the scanner

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.910
or it was a bad scanner
day, or whatever it was.

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.370
I bet they all have them,
and it's just sometimes

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.430
you don't see it, but I'm trying
to be a little more honest.

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.920
OK, but you just look at this.

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.890
Given this very
schematic version of it,

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:45.450
you say, how would
you build this system?

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.920
How would you start with an
embryo and build into a genome,

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.810
or build into
whatever experience

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.780
is going to happen to
this developing organism?

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.930
How would it end up with this
very particular structure,

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.570
with those things in
approximately the same place--

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:03.960
or at least the same relative
positions-- in all subjects?

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:06.840
The face bits are always
lateral to the color bits.

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.630
The place bits are
medial to the color bits.

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:12.780
The shape bits are out
on the lateral surface.

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.520
It's like always like that.

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:17.459
How do you build a
system like that?

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:19.769
I find it hard not to
immediately think, well,

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:21.899
some aspect of this
must be innate,

00:04:21.899 --> 00:04:25.420
or how would it be so damn
similar in each individual,

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:25.920
right?

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:32.930
But it's not the
only hypothesis.

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:37.040
Some big part of it-- even if
some aspect of this is innate,

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.440
some big part of it may
also be learned or derived

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.030
from experience, OK?

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:43.498
So what do you guys think?

00:04:43.498 --> 00:04:45.290
Do you think the fact
that these structures

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:48.080
are in systematically the
same place across subjects

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.960
mean you have to build
in all that stuff,

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.510
somehow figure out how
to get a bunch of As

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:57.650
and Ts and Gs and Cs in your DNA
to give you a blueprint for how

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:59.620
to build that structure?

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:03.420
What do you think?

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:09.548
Yeah?

00:05:09.548 --> 00:05:11.090
AUDIENCE: I mean,
it's a combination,

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:14.210
but it's hard to, then,
think about how that's

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:15.980
involved in
[INAUDIBLE] generation

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:18.710
and then kind of
become more innate?

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:22.000
NANCY KANWISHER: Yeah, so
to some extent, experience--

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.800
what I mean here is
learn from experience

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.360
within each individual.

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:26.890
You could argue
that "innate" really

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:30.340
means "learned through the
experience of our ancestors,

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:33.850
and hence wired
into the DNA," yeah.

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:35.830
Anyway, I find this not
an obvious question,

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:39.527
and so we'll talk about
what the data say here.

00:05:39.527 --> 00:05:41.860
So first of all, we're going
to do some very basic facts

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:44.193
about brain development, just
to get the picture of what

00:05:44.193 --> 00:05:47.290
we're talking about physically
with the development of brains.

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:50.980
So we can ask, what
is present at birth?

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:55.030
And so it turns out that most of
the neurons in the adult brain

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:57.880
are generated before birth, OK?

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:00.760
So most of the actual
neurons are generated early.

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:03.400
You're not making a whole
lot more after birth--

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:05.650
a few, but not a lot.

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:08.500
Further, the current view is
that most of the long-range

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:11.000
connections-- that means like
a connection between this part

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.250
and that part of the brain--

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:14.770
are also present at birth, OK?

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:20.240
Nonetheless, even though a lot
of stuff is present at birth,

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:23.210
a lot of stuff changes in the
first couple of years of life.

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:25.880
Most obviously, the
brain doubles in volume

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:29.165
in the first year,
from a two-week-old,

00:06:29.165 --> 00:06:31.450
to a one-year-old,
to a two-year-old.

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:38.600
The cortical thickness-- you
can see here the dark stuff,

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:41.300
which is the gray
matter out there--

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:46.910
increases sharply between
years one and two.

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:49.610
But also, the complexity
of each individual neuron

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:52.790
increases dramatically in
the first few years of life.

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:56.060
So here's a schematic picture
of a piece of gray matter here.

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:57.650
We have some number
of neurons here

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:01.640
with a few little processes
and a few connections.

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:04.580
And over the first
couple of years of life,

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:07.610
those connections
get much more dense,

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:09.230
and the neurons get
much more complex.

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:13.400
OK, and the final
thing that really

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:18.440
matters early on in development
is that myelination happens

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:19.980
rapidly in the first few years.

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:22.400
And remember, myelin--
this is a little reminder--

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:25.160
neuron with that yellow stuff,
which is a bunch of cells

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:28.970
that wrap around the axons,
the long processes of a neuron.

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:31.938
And that myelin
sheath builds up a lot

00:07:31.938 --> 00:07:33.230
over the first couple of years.

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:35.630
And that's important, because
the myelin sheath enables

00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:37.940
those neurons to send
their signals faster

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:41.070
down their axons, OK?

00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:44.610
OK, and this is just a
picture of different--

00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:47.250
of a vertical slice like
this through the anatomy

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:52.530
of infants of different ages,
from 107 days up to about a

00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:53.190
year.

00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:54.990
And the colored
stuff in the middle

00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:57.240
is degree of
myelination, which you

00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:59.760
can see with various
kinds of anatomical scans.

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:03.540
You can see it starts at 107
days with a tiny little bit

00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:06.690
in the middle, and it gets
more and more myelinated

00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:09.300
and moves from
center to periphery

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:11.460
over the first year of life.

00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:14.370
So all those fiber
pathways are getting

00:08:14.370 --> 00:08:19.920
accelerated as they get wrapped
with myelin and hence sped up.

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:25.020
OK, all right, so bottom
line is most neurons

00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:27.210
and long-range connections
are in place at birth,

00:08:27.210 --> 00:08:30.640
but development continues
rapidly in the first two years,

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:33.960
especially increasing complexity
of neurons and synapses

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:36.870
and myelination of long-range
connections and white matter,

00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:37.409
OK?

00:08:37.409 --> 00:08:40.919
So it's just basic anatomy,
nothing functional yet.

00:08:40.919 --> 00:08:43.350
OK, now we're going to
consider in some detail

00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:46.560
the case of face perception,
not really because that's

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:48.300
what I work on--

00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:50.130
or used to work on, mostly--

00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:52.140
but just because
there's a very rich set

00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:54.480
of data where people have
grappled with this question

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:56.190
in the case of face perception.

00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:58.590
Next time, we'll talk about
the navigation network

00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:01.950
and reorientation-- what parts
of that system might be innate

00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:04.058
and learned.

00:09:04.058 --> 00:09:05.850
So I'll just say right
out of the beginning

00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:08.880
that this is an extremely
active area, where every time I

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:11.970
turn around, another paper
comes out that contradicts

00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:13.740
a previously-published finding.

00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:16.320
And so that makes
it fun, but it means

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:18.653
there isn't going to be some
really tight, perfect story

00:09:18.653 --> 00:09:19.153
here.

00:09:19.153 --> 00:09:21.720
And I'd rather take you guys
straight to the cutting edge,

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:26.310
even though it's kind of a mess,
than give you a nicely packaged

00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:28.740
but surely wrong picture, OK?

00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:31.228
Because again, I think what
matters most in this area

00:09:31.228 --> 00:09:33.270
is how do you go about
answering these questions,

00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:36.900
rather than what is the
current state of the thoughts

00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:37.680
about the answers.

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:39.472
OK, so how are we going
to think about, how

00:09:39.472 --> 00:09:41.472
does face perception develop?

00:09:41.472 --> 00:09:42.930
Well just to get
started, I'm going

00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:50.658
to show you a very brief
movie of a 72-hour-old monkey,

00:09:50.658 --> 00:09:51.910
and see what you think.

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:09.860
He's sleepy.

00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:22.070
He's pretty interested
in that face.

00:10:22.070 --> 00:10:22.760
And watch now.

00:10:29.547 --> 00:10:30.047
Hmm.

00:10:41.478 --> 00:10:45.450
[LAUGHS] Pretty cute, huh?

00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:46.325
So what do you think?

00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:51.590
What does this tell us
about face perception?

00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:52.090
Yeah?

00:10:52.090 --> 00:10:53.882
AUDIENCE: Did they try
just moving anything

00:10:53.882 --> 00:10:54.610
in front of him?

00:10:54.610 --> 00:10:56.020
NANCY KANWISHER: Good question.

00:10:56.020 --> 00:10:57.080
Good for you.

00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:58.090
Quily, is that right?

00:10:58.090 --> 00:10:58.882
AUDIENCE: "Quile-y"

00:10:58.882 --> 00:11:02.320
NANCY KANWISHER:
"Quile-y", all right.

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:05.703
Yes, so Quiley asked, did
they try moving just anything

00:11:05.703 --> 00:11:06.370
in front of him?

00:11:06.370 --> 00:11:07.930
Absolutely the right question.

00:11:07.930 --> 00:11:10.150
So that monkey seems pretty
interested in that face,

00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:11.920
but a face is a moving thing.

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:15.340
Motion is very salient to young
primates-- humans, and monkeys,

00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:17.800
and many others, absolutely.

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:19.180
What else did you see in here?

00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:22.543
Yeah.

00:11:22.543 --> 00:11:25.740
AUDIENCE: It started
imitating [INAUDIBLE]..

00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:27.120
NANCY KANWISHER: Yeah, kind of.

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:29.400
I mean, the person--

00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:32.340
the adult human there--
was moving their mouth open

00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:35.382
like this, and the monkey
was doing something

00:11:35.382 --> 00:11:36.090
with their mouth.

00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:37.995
So what would that require?

00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:41.530
Sorry?

00:11:41.530 --> 00:11:43.340
AUDIENCE: I like,
I have another.

00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:48.958
Also, was the monkey allowed
to touch its face before this?

00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:50.500
NANCY KANWISHER:
Yeah, good question.

00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:51.340
Good question.

00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:55.450
72 hours is damned early,
but it's not zero experience,

00:11:55.450 --> 00:11:56.320
right?

00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:59.350
So who knows what they've
managed to pick up that early.

00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:01.250
There are actually
studies in humans,

00:12:01.250 --> 00:12:03.340
which I'm hoping Heather
knows better than me.

00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:04.720
Those Andy Melzoff things.

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:05.890
How young are those humans?

00:12:05.890 --> 00:12:08.532
Those are like first hour.

00:12:08.532 --> 00:12:10.135
AUDIENCE: Yeah, [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:10.135 --> 00:12:11.510
NANCY KANWISHER:
I think it's a--

00:12:11.510 --> 00:12:12.718
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:12.718 --> 00:12:14.260
NANCY KANWISHER: So
there are studies

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:16.300
in humans where you can
show versions of that,

00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:19.132
with newborn infants copying--

00:12:19.132 --> 00:12:21.340
the experimenter comes up
and sticks their tongue out

00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:25.210
at the infant, and the infant
does that back, kinda sorta.

00:12:25.210 --> 00:12:29.210
Certainly within the first two
days, maybe even earlier, OK?

00:12:29.210 --> 00:12:31.090
OK, so it's very suggestive.

00:12:31.090 --> 00:12:33.700
It's tantalizing, but we
need controlled conditions.

00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:37.210
It doesn't tell us
everything we need to know.

00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:39.055
OK, so if we think
about it, there

00:12:39.055 --> 00:12:44.020
are ends of the hypothesis space
about how all of this could go.

00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:47.228
As Alana mentioned, everything
is both genes and experience.

00:12:47.228 --> 00:12:49.270
That's true, but there
are very, very importantly

00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:51.790
different ways in which
genes and experience can

00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:57.730
act together-- some in which
a big part of the heft of what

00:12:57.730 --> 00:12:59.425
the adult form has
might be built in,

00:12:59.425 --> 00:13:01.300
and other stories where
most of the structure

00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:02.360
comes from experience.

00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:04.318
So just because everything
is both doesn't mean

00:13:04.318 --> 00:13:07.120
we shouldn't flesh out
exactly what comes from what.

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:11.020
So on one end of
the spectrum, you

00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:14.440
might imagine that there's
some very, very rudimentary

00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:19.330
precursor that has to be built
in, plus a learning mechanism,

00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:20.350
OK?

00:13:20.350 --> 00:13:23.080
Or a bunch of
rudimentary precursors,

00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:24.820
which are just there
to get the system

00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:27.280
to learn in the right way, OK?

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:29.590
And so we'll talk
shortly about the idea

00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:33.340
that there might be some kind
of innate template for faces

00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:36.490
that gets monkeys and
humans to look at faces.

00:13:36.490 --> 00:13:38.920
And then, the idea is once you
get them to look at a face,

00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:42.250
then experience can take over
from there and do the rest.

00:13:42.250 --> 00:13:46.600
But you've got to get them
to collect the right input.

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:49.450
And there's lots of interesting
computational work going on now

00:13:49.450 --> 00:13:53.680
where people are using various
computational models to say,

00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:55.930
what do we have to
build into, say,

00:13:55.930 --> 00:13:58.570
a convolutional neural
network or some other kind

00:13:58.570 --> 00:14:02.650
of computational model to get
it to do some complicated thing?

00:14:02.650 --> 00:14:06.160
I just came from a job talk
the last hour-- really amazing

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:08.440
talk-- where the guy is
showing that if you build

00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:12.460
in, basically, curiosity
early on in a network,

00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:15.610
you get much more general
learners than if you

00:14:15.610 --> 00:14:20.890
build in a bunch of goals for
a developing network to seek.

00:14:20.890 --> 00:14:23.530
anyway it's a very active
area, and the paper

00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:25.570
that I just decided
to assign to you guys,

00:14:25.570 --> 00:14:27.760
just kind of skim
it and get the gist.

00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:30.290
The basic idea-- this
is from Shimon Ullman,

00:14:30.290 --> 00:14:32.140
who is a very deep
thinker in this field.

00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:36.130
And he argues that hands are
very important in infants.

00:14:36.130 --> 00:14:40.065
Faces are important, but so are
hands, because hands do stuff.

00:14:40.065 --> 00:14:41.440
And we're social
primates, and we

00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:44.050
want to learn from other social
primates like our parents.

00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:46.145
And watching their hands
is extremely informative.

00:14:46.145 --> 00:14:47.770
Whatever they're
doing with their hands

00:14:47.770 --> 00:14:49.840
is probably stuff we
need to learn about.

00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:52.840
And further, we need to know
where they're looking, right?

00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:54.295
So gaze perception.

00:14:54.295 --> 00:14:55.605
I think I did this demo before.

00:14:55.605 --> 00:14:57.730
If I'm talking to you guys,
and I start doing that,

00:14:57.730 --> 00:15:00.147
it's really hard, even though
you know I'm just faking you

00:15:00.147 --> 00:15:04.150
out, not to have your
attention pulled over there,

00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:06.140
and infants need to
learn that as well.

00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:09.070
So Shimon Ullman's
basic idea is that you

00:15:09.070 --> 00:15:11.920
can start with an extremely
rudimentary system,

00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:14.470
and all you have to build
in is this idea that he

00:15:14.470 --> 00:15:15.850
calls "mover," right?

00:15:15.850 --> 00:15:18.970
So the idea is that if you look
in a whole set of, say, YouTube

00:15:18.970 --> 00:15:22.030
videos, and you just look
for patches of the image that

00:15:22.030 --> 00:15:23.800
are moving, that's no good.

00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:24.800
It won't be a hand.

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:27.770
It might be a whole animal,
or a face, or something else.

00:15:27.770 --> 00:15:30.220
But if you look
in YouTube videos,

00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:33.370
a proxy for natural experience--
it's OK; it's not perfect,

00:15:33.370 --> 00:15:36.730
but it's something- you look
for a patch of the image that

00:15:36.730 --> 00:15:41.230
moves over and then causes
another previously-stationary

00:15:41.230 --> 00:15:43.270
image patch to move.

00:15:43.270 --> 00:15:46.660
That's what happens when
we pick stuff up, OK?

00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:49.930
And so his idea is you can
build in this extremely simple

00:15:49.930 --> 00:15:50.470
thing--

00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:53.620
Mover, which is a very
simple visual algorithm,

00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:56.540
can find image patches and move
over and cause another image

00:15:56.540 --> 00:15:57.625
patch--

00:15:57.625 --> 00:15:59.770
or then the two image
patches move together.

00:15:59.770 --> 00:16:02.770
And Mover will enable you
to identify hands in images

00:16:02.770 --> 00:16:03.400
pretty well.

00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:04.900
He looks in YouTube
videos and shows

00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:06.970
that it's really good
at picking out hands.

00:16:06.970 --> 00:16:09.760
And then, further, once
you've picked out hands,

00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:11.710
that's a really
important teaching signal

00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:13.300
in teaching you to read gaze.

00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:15.430
Because often, people
look at their hands

00:16:15.430 --> 00:16:18.760
before they do things
with them, yeah?

00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:21.940
So the idea is there's a
very active ferment now

00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:23.570
in computational
modeling saying,

00:16:23.570 --> 00:16:26.710
how can we start with just the
most rudimentary, minimalist

00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:30.415
stuff that has to be built in,
and then build on experience

00:16:30.415 --> 00:16:31.540
to get the rest from there?

00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:32.757
Is that idea clear?

00:16:32.757 --> 00:16:34.340
It's worth reading
that paper, though.

00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:35.382
It's beautifully written.

00:16:35.382 --> 00:16:36.430
He's brilliant.

00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:38.740
OK, so that's one
end of the spectrum.

00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:42.873
Nobody thinks that you
learn absolutely everything

00:16:42.873 --> 00:16:43.540
from experience.

00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:44.830
You've got to
build in something.

00:16:44.830 --> 00:16:46.955
Plus, we know all those
neurons are there at birth.

00:16:46.955 --> 00:16:48.800
And so the idea
is some version--

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:52.428
the minimalist
nativist view says

00:16:52.428 --> 00:16:54.220
you build in a few very
rudimentary things,

00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:56.200
and they're enough to
bootstrap learning.

00:16:56.200 --> 00:17:00.052
OK, on the other end of the
spectrum, you might think--

00:17:00.052 --> 00:17:01.510
and many have
proposed-- that we're

00:17:01.510 --> 00:17:04.390
born with a nearly
adult-like system that

00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:07.900
only needs fine-tuning
from experience, right?

00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:10.990
Nobody thinks that zero
experience is necessary.

00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:14.750
That would be kind of
crazy, or implausible.

00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:18.260
But on the other extreme, this
view is that most of the stuff

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:19.250
is built-in.

00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:21.260
OK, everybody get the
theoretical space here

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:22.910
that we're considering?

00:17:22.910 --> 00:17:26.339
OK, so what kind of data can
constrain these questions?

00:17:26.339 --> 00:17:29.180
Well, one obvious question
is, what is present at birth?

00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:30.440
What is the initial state--

00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:33.740
or as close as we can get to it?

00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:36.440
Then we can ask, how does
the system change over time

00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:38.240
from birth onward?

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:41.090
And then we can ask, what are
the causal roles of experience

00:17:41.090 --> 00:17:44.900
and biological maturation
in that change after birth?

00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:46.848
So that's the whole
set of questions

00:17:46.848 --> 00:17:48.890
we'd need to answer to
understand how development

00:17:48.890 --> 00:17:49.910
works.

00:17:49.910 --> 00:17:52.520
And a very central-- if
not the central-- challenge

00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:57.080
of development is that
experience and maturation are

00:17:57.080 --> 00:18:01.040
deeply confounded as you look
from birth onward, right?

00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:03.830
So five-year-olds are
both more mature--

00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:06.080
they've had more time for
their biological systems

00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:08.750
to wire themselves up, including
their bodies, and their brains,

00:18:08.750 --> 00:18:09.960
and the whole bit--

00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:12.920
and maybe some of that
is just on a maturation

00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:14.090
kind of autopilot.

00:18:14.090 --> 00:18:16.560
But they've also had
a lot more experience.

00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:18.620
So one of the central
challenges of development

00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:21.140
is trying to figure out
how those later stages--

00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:24.410
like two months old, one
year old, 10 years old--

00:18:24.410 --> 00:18:29.180
how those changes that happen
between birth and those stages

00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:29.990
can--

00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:33.310
how can we tease apart which of
that came from just maturation

00:18:33.310 --> 00:18:34.910
and which came from experience?

00:18:34.910 --> 00:18:37.430
All right, OK.

00:18:37.430 --> 00:18:41.720
Importantly, things that
happen well after birth

00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:46.660
need not be learned, right?

00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:48.190
So think about puberty.

00:18:48.190 --> 00:18:52.210
Puberty is going to
happen around 10, 11, 12.

00:18:52.210 --> 00:18:54.850
And OK, you've got
to eat and have

00:18:54.850 --> 00:18:56.630
some basic inputs
to your system,

00:18:56.630 --> 00:18:58.660
but it's pretty much
going to happen.

00:18:58.660 --> 00:19:01.510
It's not a product of
what you were taught

00:19:01.510 --> 00:19:03.670
or the particular
information that landed

00:19:03.670 --> 00:19:06.280
on your sensory receptors.

00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:08.590
I'm sure there's some
obscure influences that I

00:19:08.590 --> 00:19:10.120
don't know about,
but mostly, it's

00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:11.980
on a developmental autopilot.

00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:13.240
It's just going to happen.

00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:15.310
OK, so keep in mind--
this is really important--

00:19:15.310 --> 00:19:17.350
that things that
happen well after birth

00:19:17.350 --> 00:19:19.030
aren't necessarily learned.

00:19:19.030 --> 00:19:22.630
It might be just maturation
that's continuing, right?

00:19:22.630 --> 00:19:26.740
OK, just as being 5 feet tall
versus a foot and 1/2 tall

00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:27.940
isn't really learned.

00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:33.070
It's just a maturation
program that unfolds.

00:19:33.070 --> 00:19:37.000
OK, so we can ask these three
questions both behaviorally

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.110
and naturally.

00:19:38.110 --> 00:19:40.450
And ultimately, we want
them to tell the same story.

00:19:40.450 --> 00:19:43.150
When I said there's some
chaos in this field right now,

00:19:43.150 --> 00:19:45.850
I mean that basically, they're
not converging very well yet,

00:19:45.850 --> 00:19:47.770
but that's fun--

00:19:47.770 --> 00:19:48.310
sort of.

00:19:48.310 --> 00:19:49.960
[LAUGHS] Sometimes
it's aggravating,

00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:51.310
but mostly, it's fun.

00:19:51.310 --> 00:19:53.390
OK, so let's start with
some behavioral data.

00:19:53.390 --> 00:19:54.970
So let's consider
the initial state

00:19:54.970 --> 00:19:57.100
of face perception in newborns.

00:19:57.100 --> 00:20:01.060
OK, so we can ask, what kind
of perceptual, face perceptual

00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:02.650
abilities are
present in newborns?

00:20:02.650 --> 00:20:04.990
And we can ask whether they
can detect a face-- that

00:20:04.990 --> 00:20:07.690
is, discriminate a
face from a non-face,

00:20:07.690 --> 00:20:12.190
whether it's a body, or an
object, or something else.

00:20:12.190 --> 00:20:14.500
We can ask about preferred
attention to faces.

00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:16.510
Do they, do newborns
want to look at faces

00:20:16.510 --> 00:20:18.610
more than non-faces?

00:20:18.610 --> 00:20:21.280
We can ask about the
ability to recognize faces,

00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:25.150
to discriminate one
face from another, OK?

00:20:25.150 --> 00:20:27.460
And we can ask about the
ability to recognize faces

00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:28.695
across image changes.

00:20:28.695 --> 00:20:30.820
So we spent a lot of time
in the first few lectures

00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:32.890
talking about the central
problem of invariance

00:20:32.890 --> 00:20:33.880
in vision--

00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:36.010
about, how do you know
that this image that you're

00:20:36.010 --> 00:20:38.110
looking at here is the
same person as that image,

00:20:38.110 --> 00:20:40.480
even though those are
very different images?

00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:43.180
And actually, this image
on your retina right

00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:46.810
now is more different than
this image on your retina

00:20:46.810 --> 00:20:49.360
than if we got one of you and
came up-- had you come up here

00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:50.920
and had you look forward.

00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:54.253
So the image changes that result
from a change in orientation

00:20:54.253 --> 00:20:56.170
are greater than the
image changes that result

00:20:56.170 --> 00:20:57.490
from a change in identity.

00:20:57.490 --> 00:20:59.410
So it's a big
computational challenge.

00:20:59.410 --> 00:21:02.140
When is that solved?

00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:04.630
And then, there are these
so-called signatures

00:21:04.630 --> 00:21:06.538
of face perception
that we've talked

00:21:06.538 --> 00:21:08.830
about a little bit-- for
example, the inversion effect.

00:21:08.830 --> 00:21:11.650
Recall the inversion effect
is larger in magnitude

00:21:11.650 --> 00:21:12.820
for faces than non-faces.

00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:15.940
So we can ask when
those things develop.

00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:17.740
OK, so let's start
with face detection

00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:20.620
and preferred
attention to faces.

00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:22.990
Well, so classic
studies from the early

00:21:22.990 --> 00:21:26.110
'90s, and actually, some of
them going back to the '70s,

00:21:26.110 --> 00:21:27.910
did the following
very low-tech thing--

00:21:27.910 --> 00:21:30.380
a low-tech drawing of
a low-tech experiment.

00:21:30.380 --> 00:21:31.870
You take a newborn infant.

00:21:31.870 --> 00:21:34.900
In this case, they're less
than an hour old, right?

00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:37.210
You've got to set up
in maternity wards.

00:21:37.210 --> 00:21:39.850
You want the data,
that's what you do.

00:21:39.850 --> 00:21:42.740
Of course, you have to ask
the parents and all of that.

00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:44.800
But then, you take this
infant and you sit them

00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:47.770
on a person's lap with
a video camera overhead,

00:21:47.770 --> 00:21:52.540
and you move different objects
over the infant's head, OK?

00:21:52.540 --> 00:21:55.900
And the different objects
that were moved, in this case,

00:21:55.900 --> 00:21:58.330
were patterns that were
drawn on this paddle that's

00:21:58.330 --> 00:22:00.220
moved over the infant's head.

00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:03.730
And the pattern could be a
schematic face like that,

00:22:03.730 --> 00:22:06.430
a scrambled schematic
face like that,

00:22:06.430 --> 00:22:09.850
and a blank with nothing in it.

00:22:09.850 --> 00:22:12.040
And what you measure is,
how far does the infant

00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:15.940
turn their head or their eyes
following that paddle as you

00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:17.350
move it over them.

00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:19.480
OK, nice low-tech measure.

00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:23.410
And what you find is they turn
their heads and their eyes

00:22:23.410 --> 00:22:26.440
farther when it's an actual
schematic face than when it's

00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:32.750
a scrambled schematic face or a
blank, within an hour of birth.

00:22:32.750 --> 00:22:35.650
Then you can still say,
well, their parents probably

00:22:35.650 --> 00:22:38.020
smiled at them quickly before
they were snatched away

00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:42.070
to do the experiment, so they
had some face experience,

00:22:42.070 --> 00:22:43.880
but boy, not a whole lot.

00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:46.160
And this is a very
abstract face here.

00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:49.480
So this has long been taken as
one of the key bits of evidence

00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:55.540
that something seems likely
to be innate about faces, OK?

00:22:55.540 --> 00:23:00.640
But now, what needs
to be innate for that?

00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:03.902
And it's a bizarre thing, where
this happens in the first two

00:23:03.902 --> 00:23:05.110
months of life and goes away.

00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:06.310
And there's a lot
of consideration

00:23:06.310 --> 00:23:07.270
of what that means.

00:23:07.270 --> 00:23:09.400
Maybe the first two months
is enough to bootstrap

00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:10.983
learning in the way
I was just talking

00:23:10.983 --> 00:23:14.860
about-- bootstrapping, getting
attention to the right places.

00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:17.470
But there's also a huge
literature on this phenomenon

00:23:17.470 --> 00:23:19.870
where there's a big
debate about exactly how

00:23:19.870 --> 00:23:21.910
simple those cues need to be.

00:23:21.910 --> 00:23:25.120
So people have done
many variations of this

00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:29.440
and one dominant story
is that all you need

00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:33.820
is a pattern that has more stuff
on the top than on the bottom,

00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:34.600
OK?

00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:36.280
And that's enough
that infants will

00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:39.080
follow this more than that.

00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:41.710
And the idea is that in
the visual environment

00:23:41.710 --> 00:23:45.920
of an infant, that's
sufficient to pick out faces.

00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:48.137
So there's been pushback
against this view as well.

00:23:48.137 --> 00:23:50.220
It's probably a little
more complicated than that.

00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:53.060
We won't go down the rabbit
hole of all those details,

00:23:53.060 --> 00:23:56.090
but whatever it is,
it's pretty simple.

00:23:56.090 --> 00:23:58.580
So this is another example of
what I was mentioning before

00:23:58.580 --> 00:23:59.750
with the Ullman case.

00:23:59.750 --> 00:24:02.930
This is a case where it
may be possible to build

00:24:02.930 --> 00:24:04.880
in something pretty basic--

00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:06.380
a pretty basic
template-- and then

00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:08.210
let learning take it from there.

00:24:08.210 --> 00:24:08.820
Make sense?

00:24:08.820 --> 00:24:10.320
If the infants are
looking at faces,

00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:14.030
then they can use some kind of
synaptic plasticity, whatever,

00:24:14.030 --> 00:24:16.370
and learn from their
experience to discriminate

00:24:16.370 --> 00:24:17.900
one face from another.

00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:21.800
OK, so these things are
present within a day or two.

00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:24.758
What about discrimination
of individual identity?

00:24:24.758 --> 00:24:26.300
First problem, how
are we going to be

00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:29.540
able to tell what
a newborn can see?

00:24:29.540 --> 00:24:31.250
And so I didn't
want you guys to be

00:24:31.250 --> 00:24:33.350
to thrown by this method
in the last assignment,

00:24:33.350 --> 00:24:37.278
so I told you where there's a
version of the explanation I'm

00:24:37.278 --> 00:24:38.070
just going to give.

00:24:38.070 --> 00:24:39.945
So if you already watched
that, my apologies.

00:24:39.945 --> 00:24:42.240
You can read your
email for a minute.

00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:45.920
So the classic experiment--

00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:48.500
a classic experiment--
that enabled

00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:52.910
us to really ask how a newborn,
non-verbal infant, what

00:24:52.910 --> 00:24:56.300
they see in the world, is
done by Kellman and Spelke.

00:24:56.300 --> 00:24:58.460
Liz Spelke up at Harvard
was at the forefront

00:24:58.460 --> 00:25:00.830
of getting this method
to really tell us

00:25:00.830 --> 00:25:03.860
a huge great deal about what
infants see and understand

00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:04.535
about the world.

00:25:04.535 --> 00:25:06.410
And this method that
I'm about to show to you

00:25:06.410 --> 00:25:08.990
has been the basis of what's
sometimes called "The Infancy

00:25:08.990 --> 00:25:12.140
Revolution," which is basically
the insight that, actually,

00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:14.420
infants know a lot.

00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:16.800
Their perceptual systems
are really sophisticated.

00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:17.930
They know about physics.

00:25:17.930 --> 00:25:19.760
They know all kinds
of social stuff.

00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:22.070
Within a few months of
life, they know a lot.

00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:24.860
And that's been a radical
change in our understanding

00:25:24.860 --> 00:25:27.420
of development based on
just behavioral work.

00:25:27.420 --> 00:25:29.360
So here's the method.

00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:31.430
OK, so what Spelke did--

00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:33.140
I always forget
to bring the demo.

00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:34.145
Hang on one moment.

00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:38.810
We don't need much.

00:25:38.810 --> 00:25:43.133
OK, so she showed infants
stuff like this, OK?

00:25:43.133 --> 00:25:44.300
The two hands are not there.

00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:47.600
You just arranged
to see this, OK?

00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:49.490
So even if you hadn't
seen me, imagine

00:25:49.490 --> 00:25:52.190
if you hadn't seen me pick
up the phone and the pen,

00:25:52.190 --> 00:25:54.500
and you didn't already
know what they were,

00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:56.330
and you're seeing this, OK?

00:25:56.330 --> 00:25:59.450
That's what they see, OK?

00:25:59.450 --> 00:26:01.880
So now, the question is,
when infants see that,

00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:04.280
do they think that that's this--

00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:06.980
thing behind a rectangle--

00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:09.260
or do they think it's
two separate bits moving

00:26:09.260 --> 00:26:10.400
behind the rectangle?

00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:12.740
It could be two separate
bits moving together, right?

00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:14.390
Everybody get the question?

00:26:14.390 --> 00:26:16.730
OK, so how would we know
what the infants thought

00:26:16.730 --> 00:26:18.410
was back there?

00:26:18.410 --> 00:26:22.880
OK, well, we use what's known
as habituation of looking time.

00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:24.860
Again, you sit the
infant on a parent's lap,

00:26:24.860 --> 00:26:26.480
and you show them
stuff, and you just

00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:28.280
measure how long they look.

00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:31.880
It's magnificently low-tech
but really profound.

00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:34.310
OK, so what we're
going to show here

00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:37.760
is how long the infant looks
on each trial as a function

00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:40.860
of how many times you do it.

00:26:40.860 --> 00:26:43.100
So you show the infant
this the first time,

00:26:43.100 --> 00:26:44.630
and they look for 40 seconds.

00:26:44.630 --> 00:26:45.650
That's a long time.

00:26:45.650 --> 00:26:49.410
You show them again, they look
for 35 seconds, and so forth.

00:26:49.410 --> 00:26:53.570
And by the fifth or sixth
time, the infant is bored.

00:26:53.570 --> 00:26:57.530
Like been there, done
that, bored, right?

00:26:57.530 --> 00:26:59.210
OK, now they're bored.

00:26:59.210 --> 00:27:03.540
Now we have a moment to say,
OK, what did you think it was?

00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:08.630
And so now, what you can
ask is, what do they think--

00:27:08.630 --> 00:27:11.160
you then show them
either this or this,

00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:14.570
and you ask them which of
those they're bored to, right?

00:27:14.570 --> 00:27:17.390
So the idea is if,
when looking at this,

00:27:17.390 --> 00:27:19.190
they thought there
was a continuous line

00:27:19.190 --> 00:27:22.880
behind the occluder, then they
should be more bored by this.

00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:25.683
But if they thought that was
two separate pieces, then

00:27:25.683 --> 00:27:27.100
they should be
more bored by that.

00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:28.298
Does that makes sense?

00:27:28.298 --> 00:27:30.590
Because it's the same thing
they're already bored with.

00:27:30.590 --> 00:27:32.007
I mean, it's not
exactly the same.

00:27:32.007 --> 00:27:33.620
The occluder isn't there, right?

00:27:33.620 --> 00:27:35.180
But it's more similar.

00:27:35.180 --> 00:27:36.950
OK, so here's the data.

00:27:36.950 --> 00:27:38.040
Here's what they find.

00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:39.390
So what does that mean?

00:27:39.390 --> 00:27:41.742
What do the infants see
when you show them this?

00:27:41.742 --> 00:27:42.950
It's right there in the data.

00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:45.260
Look at the first
test trial here.

00:27:45.260 --> 00:27:46.880
This is the first
test trial, when

00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:52.190
you show the complete
line or the broken line.

00:27:52.190 --> 00:27:54.410
What do they see here?

00:27:54.410 --> 00:27:56.090
Yeah, they saw the complete one.

00:27:56.090 --> 00:27:59.000
That's why, when you present
the complete one again,

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:00.440
they're still bored--

00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:02.000
already saw that.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:03.870
Make sense?

00:28:03.870 --> 00:28:04.850
So isn't that awesome?

00:28:04.850 --> 00:28:07.430
It's so low-tech and
so simple, but this

00:28:07.430 --> 00:28:10.070
is how you can ask an
infant, what do you see?

00:28:10.070 --> 00:28:10.832
Yeah?

00:28:10.832 --> 00:28:13.550
AUDIENCE: Why does it switch
positions in the second trial?

00:28:13.550 --> 00:28:15.800
NANCY KANWISHER: You know,
frankly, I never understand

00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:18.080
why infant and
development people do

00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:19.330
a second and third trial.

00:28:19.330 --> 00:28:21.303
Seems to me by this
point, the jig is up.

00:28:21.303 --> 00:28:23.720
I think it's just because it's
hard to get enough infants,

00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:25.070
and you need more
data, and so they

00:28:25.070 --> 00:28:26.330
do a second and third trial.

00:28:26.330 --> 00:28:28.580
But to me, that's
the diagnostic one.

00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:30.710
And that's probably not
a significant switch,

00:28:30.710 --> 00:28:32.820
but whatever's going on
out there is obviously

00:28:32.820 --> 00:28:34.070
much less important than this.

00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:35.870
Heather, do you have a
better answer than that?

00:28:35.870 --> 00:28:37.287
Why do they do
those other trials?

00:28:37.287 --> 00:28:40.980
They always do, and it
just seems like, what?

00:28:40.980 --> 00:28:41.480
[LAUGHS]

00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:42.438
AUDIENCE: I don't know.

00:28:42.438 --> 00:28:44.480
NANCY KANWISHER:
Yeah, I don't either.

00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:45.802
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:28:45.802 --> 00:28:47.760
NANCY KANWISHER: Oh, you
do it every which way,

00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:48.930
but you do it pretty fast.

00:28:48.930 --> 00:28:51.420
They get bored, and you don't
want to wait half an hour

00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:52.470
and come back, right?

00:28:52.470 --> 00:28:53.553
I mean, you could do that.

00:28:53.553 --> 00:28:56.130
Then that would be a
memory question, right?

00:28:56.130 --> 00:28:57.900
Yeah, Jimmy.

00:28:57.900 --> 00:29:00.315
AUDIENCE: Just curious,
is this conserved

00:29:00.315 --> 00:29:03.640
between [INAUDIBLE] do they
all see complete lines, where

00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:04.140
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:05.220
NANCY KANWISHER:
It's pretty robust.

00:29:05.220 --> 00:29:06.887
Well, OK, so first
of all, these methods

00:29:06.887 --> 00:29:09.060
are awesome, that you can
learn these deep things

00:29:09.060 --> 00:29:11.220
about perception in infants.

00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:12.720
But these data
are noisy as hell.

00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:14.220
There's no error
bars on this plot,

00:29:14.220 --> 00:29:16.678
but I bet if there were, you'd
have to run a lot of infants

00:29:16.678 --> 00:29:18.810
to get to the point where
you reach significance.

00:29:18.810 --> 00:29:21.270
Because a lot of times, the
infants will just throw up,

00:29:21.270 --> 00:29:24.160
or they'll just do what-- they
do all kinds of random things.

00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:26.820
So the data are extremely
noisy, and it's very hard

00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:28.210
to get enough data
with an infant

00:29:28.210 --> 00:29:30.210
to say anything about the
difference between one

00:29:30.210 --> 00:29:31.380
infant and another.

00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:34.230
By the way, there's a very
exciting development going on

00:29:34.230 --> 00:29:36.000
in this department
right now, where

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.700
Kim Scott, who's a former grad
student of this department,

00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:40.950
has figured out how to do
looking time experiments

00:29:40.950 --> 00:29:43.560
like this online, OK?

00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:45.960
And that's hugely important,
because the number one

00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:48.300
bottleneck in this kind
of developmental research

00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:51.330
has been finding enough
infants, or getting

00:29:51.330 --> 00:29:52.810
enough data per infant.

00:29:52.810 --> 00:29:55.350
And so I think that she's going
to just crack it wide open.

00:29:55.350 --> 00:29:55.850
Talia?

00:29:55.850 --> 00:29:58.590
AUDIENCE: I guess I'm
a little bit confused

00:29:58.590 --> 00:30:03.270
how we know what the infant
really saw based on how long it

00:30:03.270 --> 00:30:05.670
looked at something.

00:30:05.670 --> 00:30:10.830
Could it be that maybe
they look at like--

00:30:10.830 --> 00:30:13.080
maybe they look at the
broken sticks longer,

00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:15.460
because it's like what
they thought was behind it,

00:30:15.460 --> 00:30:18.030
so they're now excited that
they get to see what's--

00:30:18.030 --> 00:30:20.730
NANCY KANWISHER: Maybe, but
then, why would you get this?

00:30:20.730 --> 00:30:24.030
So we know from this that
the more familiar it looks,

00:30:24.030 --> 00:30:26.130
the less time they look.

00:30:26.130 --> 00:30:27.840
So you would have to
come up with-- yeah,

00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:29.170
there's wiggle
room in these data,

00:30:29.170 --> 00:30:30.660
but you'd have to come--
your account would have

00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:32.520
to say, why would they
look less, and less,

00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:35.640
and less long when we repeat
the exact same thing, right?

00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:38.695
And you could tell a
story like, OK, it's

00:30:38.695 --> 00:30:41.070
a little bit different, because
the occluder isn't there.

00:30:41.070 --> 00:30:42.300
But it's a little bit
the same, and that's

00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:43.175
kind of edgy and fun.

00:30:43.175 --> 00:30:45.570
Or you could tell
another story, but I

00:30:45.570 --> 00:30:47.490
think the bulk of the
developmental literature

00:30:47.490 --> 00:30:49.410
shows that when you
do this kind of stuff,

00:30:49.410 --> 00:30:51.915
it's a change that
makes infants look more.

00:30:51.915 --> 00:30:54.540
I'm going to go on unless there
are questions of clarification,

00:30:54.540 --> 00:30:56.460
just because there's so
much other cool stuff.

00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:02.760
OK, so how can we use this
to study face recognition?

00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:05.130
That was just a
sidebar on the method.

00:31:05.130 --> 00:31:07.200
OK, so there's a
lab in Italy where

00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:10.230
they have an infant psychology
lab next to a maternity ward,

00:31:10.230 --> 00:31:13.470
and they've been doing
all these awesome studies.

00:31:13.470 --> 00:31:16.475
OK, and they test
1-3-day-old infants.

00:31:16.475 --> 00:31:17.850
And so one of the
things they did

00:31:17.850 --> 00:31:21.323
is show infants, just like the
paradigm I just showed you.

00:31:21.323 --> 00:31:23.490
They show the infant the
same face again, and again,

00:31:23.490 --> 00:31:24.240
and again.

00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:26.460
That's the habituation phase.

00:31:26.460 --> 00:31:28.950
And then, this is a
slightly different one.

00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:31.615
You give them a choice
of whether they--

00:31:31.615 --> 00:31:33.240
actually, you don't
give them a choice.

00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:34.110
I take it back.

00:31:34.110 --> 00:31:37.200
Yeah, you show this
condition or that condition,

00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:39.720
and you see how long
they look at each

00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:41.040
across different infants.

00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:43.620
And so this is the same person
from a different viewpoint.

00:31:43.620 --> 00:31:46.140
Actually, pretty subtle, as
we discussed with the Jenkins

00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:47.640
study way back.

00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:50.130
And that's a different
person from that viewpoint.

00:31:50.130 --> 00:31:53.640
And what they found is
that-- it's hard to see,

00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:55.740
but a very low P level
means that there's

00:31:55.740 --> 00:31:57.240
a significant
difference in how much

00:31:57.240 --> 00:32:00.250
the infants looked at those two.

00:32:00.250 --> 00:32:02.070
So that's pretty amazing.

00:32:02.070 --> 00:32:06.570
1-3-day-old infants can
apparently recognize

00:32:06.570 --> 00:32:10.710
the identity of a face, a novel
individual they don't already

00:32:10.710 --> 00:32:14.850
know, with similar-looking
faces, without hair,

00:32:14.850 --> 00:32:16.650
and across view changes.

00:32:16.650 --> 00:32:18.360
Wow, right?

00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:21.313
So that's pretty impressive.

00:32:21.313 --> 00:32:23.730
OK, and so then, they've done
all kinds of other variants.

00:32:23.730 --> 00:32:26.420
If you have them rotate all
the way from front profile,

00:32:26.420 --> 00:32:28.310
there's no longer a
significant difference.

00:32:28.310 --> 00:32:30.435
Infants can't do that.

00:32:30.435 --> 00:32:32.310
And then they do all
kinds of other variants.

00:32:32.310 --> 00:32:34.512
If you show them the
same individual and then

00:32:34.512 --> 00:32:36.470
habituate to that, they
can tell the difference

00:32:36.470 --> 00:32:37.310
between viewpoint.

00:32:37.310 --> 00:32:39.542
That's the same, and
that's different,

00:32:39.542 --> 00:32:41.000
even though it's
the same identity.

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:42.650
So you can use this
to test what they

00:32:42.650 --> 00:32:45.510
think is same or different,
which is a deep question

00:32:45.510 --> 00:32:46.010
to ask.

00:32:46.010 --> 00:32:48.630
If you're interested in
representations and cognition,

00:32:48.630 --> 00:32:51.680
the question of what an
infant, or an animal,

00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:54.230
or a bunch of neurons thinks
is the same or different

00:32:54.230 --> 00:32:56.840
is the essence of characterizing
what it represents.

00:32:56.840 --> 00:32:57.680
Yeah, Quiley?

00:32:57.680 --> 00:33:01.385
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] the
rotated face [INAUDIBLE]??

00:33:01.385 --> 00:33:02.510
NANCY KANWISHER: Down here?

00:33:02.510 --> 00:33:03.290
Yeah.

00:33:03.290 --> 00:33:04.070
Yeah, they do.

00:33:04.070 --> 00:33:06.800
So here, basically,
it's either identical,

00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:08.670
or it's different
in some respect.

00:33:08.670 --> 00:33:13.940
So given a choice, when
it's rotated anyway,

00:33:13.940 --> 00:33:16.310
the familiar one
is more similar.

00:33:16.310 --> 00:33:18.980
But down here, this one is
more similar in viewpoint.

00:33:18.980 --> 00:33:20.210
Yeah?

00:33:20.210 --> 00:33:22.850
AUDIENCE: And these are
not like the [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:22.850 --> 00:33:26.338
in such [INAUDIBLE] the
student, the [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:26.338 --> 00:33:27.880
NANCY KANWISHER:
Sorry, say it again?

00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:28.630
They're not like--

00:33:28.630 --> 00:33:31.285
AUDIENCE: The children have
seen faces before this.

00:33:31.285 --> 00:33:33.160
NANCY KANWISHER: Well,
as little as possible.

00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:35.960
As I say, I mean, they've
seen some, but not very many,

00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:38.650
and they haven't
seen these faces.

00:33:38.650 --> 00:33:42.160
So when you're trying to get
those innateness questions,

00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:43.870
you go as close to
birth as you can,

00:33:43.870 --> 00:33:46.240
but you can't usually
go into the very moment

00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:47.260
of birth itself, right?

00:33:47.260 --> 00:33:49.270
And so there's usually
some experience,

00:33:49.270 --> 00:33:51.310
and it's a challenge,
but this is pretty early.

00:33:51.310 --> 00:33:52.270
Yeah?

00:33:52.270 --> 00:33:55.850
AUDIENCE: So couldn't that just
meant that the face perception

00:33:55.850 --> 00:33:57.240
network is just like--

00:33:57.240 --> 00:34:00.100
it develops really quickly,
right after [INAUDIBLE]..

00:34:00.100 --> 00:34:01.600
NANCY KANWISHER:
It could, it could.

00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:04.480
Based on these data
alone, it could.

00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:05.950
That's considered
kind of unlikely,

00:34:05.950 --> 00:34:08.440
but I agree that that's
consistent with these data.

00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:10.719
In the first two days
of life, the whole thing

00:34:10.719 --> 00:34:11.830
wires itself up.

00:34:11.830 --> 00:34:14.290
That's be pretty unusual.

00:34:14.290 --> 00:34:17.727
It's not really consistent
with those samples of neurons

00:34:17.727 --> 00:34:19.810
that people have looked
at elsewhere in the brain,

00:34:19.810 --> 00:34:22.090
but maybe there's a special
little circuit that just

00:34:22.090 --> 00:34:23.659
wires itself up really fast.

00:34:23.659 --> 00:34:27.139
So not likely, but possible, OK?

00:34:27.139 --> 00:34:32.090
All right, now, you might
say, well, maybe there's

00:34:32.090 --> 00:34:34.699
some kind of simple
visual features

00:34:34.699 --> 00:34:37.628
that are short of an actual
face representation here.

00:34:37.628 --> 00:34:39.920
This doesn't show us that
this is something about faces

00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:42.500
per se, even though it can
generalize across viewpoints.

00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:46.670
So it's not just pixel
intensity, right?

00:34:46.670 --> 00:34:48.620
So what is the
classic way we asked

00:34:48.620 --> 00:34:51.050
this question in face
perception, where we ask,

00:34:51.050 --> 00:34:53.420
is this really something
about faces, or is it

00:34:53.420 --> 00:34:56.040
something about the low-level
perceptual properties

00:34:56.040 --> 00:34:56.540
of the face?

00:34:59.670 --> 00:35:00.920
AUDIENCE: Turn it upside down?

00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:03.500
NANCY KANWISHER: Yeah,
turn it upside down.

00:35:03.500 --> 00:35:08.370
God's gift to the face
researcher, right?

00:35:08.370 --> 00:35:11.990
So-- oh, I guess that
was not on this slide.

00:35:11.990 --> 00:35:12.710
OK, right?

00:35:12.710 --> 00:35:14.840
OK, so now, in the
next experiment,

00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:18.560
they present whole faces, or
just the internal features

00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:22.980
without hair, or just the
external features without hair.

00:35:22.980 --> 00:35:25.963
So the infants can
do that at the top.

00:35:25.963 --> 00:35:27.380
They know those
two are different.

00:35:27.380 --> 00:35:29.463
They can do this here, and
they can do that there.

00:35:29.463 --> 00:35:30.680
OK, not too shocking yet.

00:35:30.680 --> 00:35:33.950
Just tells you any of those
cues can support performance.

00:35:33.950 --> 00:35:39.110
But now, we can ask, is
that just pattern-matching?

00:35:39.110 --> 00:35:39.950
No, it's not.

00:35:39.950 --> 00:35:41.630
Because when you turn
them upside down,

00:35:41.630 --> 00:35:45.290
you find that only--

00:35:45.290 --> 00:35:49.280
let's see, it's only
performance in this case that

00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:51.380
suffers when you turn
them upside-down,

00:35:51.380 --> 00:35:54.680
not this case or that case.

00:35:54.680 --> 00:35:57.410
OK, so that shows that there
are a variety of cues here that

00:35:57.410 --> 00:36:00.200
infants could be using, but when
you show them just the internal

00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:03.560
features-- the
actual face proper--

00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:05.930
that part, the ability to
do this discrimination,

00:36:05.930 --> 00:36:08.060
goes away when you
turn it upside down.

00:36:08.060 --> 00:36:11.600
So that part, at least,
seems to be at least somewhat

00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:13.910
face-specific, or
has the signature

00:36:13.910 --> 00:36:15.920
of face-specific processing.

00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:17.690
Make sense?

00:36:17.690 --> 00:36:20.840
OK, I mean, as a
pattern, it'd be just as

00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:22.490
easy to recognize
this upside-down

00:36:22.490 --> 00:36:24.530
and distinguish it
from that upside-down,

00:36:24.530 --> 00:36:26.780
if it was just the pixels
you were registering.

00:36:26.780 --> 00:36:28.640
But if you were doing
face processing that's

00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:30.182
something like adult
face processing,

00:36:30.182 --> 00:36:32.480
you'd expect that
inversion effect.

00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:37.010
OK, all right, so where are we?

00:36:37.010 --> 00:36:40.130
And I should just say, even
this is actively debated.

00:36:40.130 --> 00:36:43.580
In fact, the author
of this study

00:36:43.580 --> 00:36:45.530
considers this
not to be evidence

00:36:45.530 --> 00:36:48.020
that that processing
is face-specific.

00:36:48.020 --> 00:36:50.690
I think she's got some of
the strongest evidence ever,

00:36:50.690 --> 00:36:52.350
but she's got some
counterargument

00:36:52.350 --> 00:36:54.350
about how in the inverted
faces, they don't look

00:36:54.350 --> 00:36:55.880
as long in the situation phase.

00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:58.250
And so it's like I'm telling
you these cool methods,

00:36:58.250 --> 00:37:01.340
but boy, every one of
them can be fought over.

00:37:01.340 --> 00:37:03.530
OK, so where are?

00:37:03.530 --> 00:37:05.060
We've just shown
that discrimination

00:37:05.060 --> 00:37:08.450
of individual identity is
present in very young newborns,

00:37:08.450 --> 00:37:12.110
recognition across viewpoints,
and inversion effects

00:37:12.110 --> 00:37:14.960
are all present within the
first few days of life.

00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:18.890
OK, so newborns have very
impressive face perception

00:37:18.890 --> 00:37:21.980
abilities, and that's
particularly surprising

00:37:21.980 --> 00:37:24.690
given that their acuity
is terrible, right?

00:37:24.690 --> 00:37:28.280
the vision is really
blurry for young infants,

00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:30.750
so it's amazing that
they can do these things.

00:37:30.750 --> 00:37:33.740
But now, there's room for
quibbling about whether this is

00:37:33.740 --> 00:37:36.320
really a face-specific system.

00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:38.270
So the inversion
effect is suggestive,

00:37:38.270 --> 00:37:40.940
but they haven't totally
nailed the case about what's

00:37:40.940 --> 00:37:42.200
being tapped into here.

00:37:42.200 --> 00:37:44.480
Is it really face
perception per se--

00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:46.160
something specific
to face perception--

00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:50.420
or is it some more generic
kind of object perception?

00:37:50.420 --> 00:37:54.350
OK, and further, we want to
know what happens after that.

00:37:54.350 --> 00:37:57.985
OK, so you don't need
to memorize this table.

00:37:57.985 --> 00:38:00.110
I'm just going to make a
few simple points with it.

00:38:00.110 --> 00:38:02.030
There are lots and
lots of studies

00:38:02.030 --> 00:38:05.030
where people have tested
behaviorally all kinds

00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:07.370
of different aspects
of face perception,

00:38:07.370 --> 00:38:09.950
and the basic story
is that by age four,

00:38:09.950 --> 00:38:12.290
you see the little
smiley face means

00:38:12.290 --> 00:38:16.730
that this adult-like property
of the face perception system

00:38:16.730 --> 00:38:18.740
is present by age four.

00:38:18.740 --> 00:38:21.830
So all of those signatures
of face perception

00:38:21.830 --> 00:38:25.580
that are present in adults
are present by age four, OK?

00:38:25.580 --> 00:38:29.600
And in fact, much of the
action is much before that.

00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:31.700
You can see that
all of these things

00:38:31.700 --> 00:38:34.280
are present at the earliest
age they've ever been tested.

00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:37.520
The little square means
nobody's tested it at that age.

00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:43.220
So all this stuff is
developing very fast, right?

00:38:43.220 --> 00:38:47.067
OK, one particularly
important thing

00:38:47.067 --> 00:38:48.650
here that you read
about a little bit,

00:38:48.650 --> 00:38:51.150
but that I want to take a moment
to make sure you understand

00:38:51.150 --> 00:38:52.880
because it's so
interesting and cool,

00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:55.700
is the phenomenon of
perceptual narrowing, OK?

00:38:55.700 --> 00:38:57.260
And this happens
in face perception,

00:38:57.260 --> 00:39:00.710
and it happens in phoneme
perception in speech.

00:39:00.710 --> 00:39:02.550
And I'm going to do a demo here.

00:39:02.550 --> 00:39:04.527
So I'm going to show you
a monkey face briefly.

00:39:04.527 --> 00:39:06.110
OK, it's going to
come on in a second,

00:39:06.110 --> 00:39:07.110
and you just look at It.

00:39:07.110 --> 00:39:07.850
Here we go.

00:39:07.850 --> 00:39:10.280
Boom, there it is, OK?

00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:13.430
OK, in a moment, I'm going to
show you another monkey face,

00:39:13.430 --> 00:39:15.622
and you're going
to shout out same

00:39:15.622 --> 00:39:17.330
if you think it's the
same, and different

00:39:17.330 --> 00:39:22.250
if you think it's different,
and, huh, if you don't know.

00:39:22.250 --> 00:39:24.800
How many people don't know?

00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:27.560
Yeah, it's different, right?

00:39:27.560 --> 00:39:29.990
OK, well, OK, maybe
that was too hard.

00:39:29.990 --> 00:39:31.370
Let's try it with a human, OK?

00:39:31.370 --> 00:39:32.660
Remember how hard that was?

00:39:32.660 --> 00:39:34.382
Now let's try it
with a human face.

00:39:34.382 --> 00:39:35.840
I'm going to show
you a human face.

00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:36.590
Everybody ready?

00:39:36.590 --> 00:39:39.420
Here we go.

00:39:39.420 --> 00:39:41.010
OK?

00:39:41.010 --> 00:39:43.260
OK, and I'm going to
show you another human,

00:39:43.260 --> 00:39:45.540
and you're going to say,
is it same or different?

00:39:45.540 --> 00:39:48.010
Here we go.

00:39:48.010 --> 00:39:49.330
Duh!

00:39:49.330 --> 00:39:51.250
Easy, right?

00:39:51.250 --> 00:39:55.450
OK, so here's the amazing thing.

00:39:55.450 --> 00:39:57.730
You were better at
that monkey face task

00:39:57.730 --> 00:39:59.740
when you were six months old.

00:39:59.740 --> 00:40:01.570
You could do that
monkey face task

00:40:01.570 --> 00:40:03.340
when you were six months old.

00:40:03.340 --> 00:40:06.040
One of the things that you
have learned from experience

00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:07.960
is that you don't
need that information,

00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:10.340
and you threw away your
ability to do that,

00:40:10.340 --> 00:40:13.450
but you had it when you
were six months old.

00:40:13.450 --> 00:40:16.300
Isn't that awesome
and interesting?

00:40:16.300 --> 00:40:19.540
That's called
perceptual narrowing.

00:40:19.540 --> 00:40:22.790
So the experiments, in
particular, do the following.

00:40:22.790 --> 00:40:25.660
You use that preferential
looking paradigm--

00:40:25.660 --> 00:40:29.110
the preferential looking to
the novel face in infants--

00:40:29.110 --> 00:40:31.150
as your measure of
discrimination ability.

00:40:31.150 --> 00:40:33.100
What can they discriminate?

00:40:33.100 --> 00:40:34.960
And so you show
two human faces--

00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:37.070
two different
individuals, like this.

00:40:37.070 --> 00:40:41.140
And so now, what you see is
that at six months, nine months,

00:40:41.140 --> 00:40:43.750
and adulthood,
people preferentially

00:40:43.750 --> 00:40:47.505
look to the novel face more
than the familiar face, OK?

00:40:47.505 --> 00:40:48.880
That's just what
we've just done.

00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:54.040
People like to look at the new
thing, not the old thing, OK?

00:40:54.040 --> 00:40:57.288
However, if we do six months,
nine months-- oh, yeah,

00:40:57.288 --> 00:40:58.330
that's what we just said.

00:40:58.330 --> 00:40:59.450
OK, they can do that.

00:40:59.450 --> 00:41:03.010
So now, if you try
this on monkey faces,

00:41:03.010 --> 00:41:07.060
you find that
adults are like us.

00:41:07.060 --> 00:41:09.640
We're barely able to tell
the familiar from the novel.

00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:12.070
We're not so good at
monkey face discrimination.

00:41:12.070 --> 00:41:15.220
Nine-months-old are the same.

00:41:15.220 --> 00:41:20.020
But at six months,
infants can discriminate

00:41:20.020 --> 00:41:25.310
the monkey faces, and you could,
too, if somebody had asked you.

00:41:25.310 --> 00:41:30.080
So there's a very similar
phenomena with phonemes.

00:41:30.080 --> 00:41:32.930
Those of you who are not
native speakers of English

00:41:32.930 --> 00:41:35.330
maybe aware of some
phonemes in English,

00:41:35.330 --> 00:41:37.760
if you learned it relatively
late, that are hard for you

00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:39.380
to discriminate.

00:41:39.380 --> 00:41:41.180
There are sounds in Hindi--

00:41:41.180 --> 00:41:43.100
I forget, it's like
a "da" and a "ta,"

00:41:43.100 --> 00:41:46.700
that sound identical to me, but
that are just like completely

00:41:46.700 --> 00:41:49.730
obviously different to
native Hindi speakers.

00:41:49.730 --> 00:41:50.960
And all languages have this.

00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:53.930
So of the kinds of phonemes
that are discriminated

00:41:53.930 --> 00:41:55.700
in any language
in the world, you

00:41:55.700 --> 00:41:58.795
could discriminate all of those
when you were six months old.

00:41:58.795 --> 00:42:00.170
And one of the
things you do when

00:42:00.170 --> 00:42:03.080
you learn a language
is just throw together

00:42:03.080 --> 00:42:05.150
in the same bag things
that are actually

00:42:05.150 --> 00:42:07.250
different that other
people can discriminate

00:42:07.250 --> 00:42:11.150
if your language doesn't
discriminate it, OK?

00:42:11.150 --> 00:42:12.650
And so you get
that with phonemes,

00:42:12.650 --> 00:42:14.450
and you get it with faces.

00:42:14.450 --> 00:42:16.880
OK, everybody get what
perceptual narrowing is?

00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:18.140
OK.

00:42:18.140 --> 00:42:19.850
OK, you also get this--

00:42:19.850 --> 00:42:21.470
I mentioned this way back--

00:42:21.470 --> 00:42:24.080
with perceiving faces
of other races, right?

00:42:24.080 --> 00:42:26.600
Not just faces of other
species, but if you grow up

00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:30.920
in an environment
where you're only

00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:34.730
exposed to races A, B,
and C, and you later

00:42:34.730 --> 00:42:36.610
have to discriminate
faces of races

00:42:36.610 --> 00:42:40.190
D, E, and F, you're not
so good at it, right?

00:42:40.190 --> 00:42:41.300
All the same deal.

00:42:41.300 --> 00:42:44.360
OK, all right.

00:42:44.360 --> 00:42:50.420
So how would we know whether
this change between six months

00:42:50.420 --> 00:42:53.570
and older is just
maturation-- it's just

00:42:53.570 --> 00:42:55.250
some kind of
developmental program

00:42:55.250 --> 00:42:58.880
that's going on autopilot
independent of what you see,

00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:00.620
or whether it's learned
from experience?

00:43:04.070 --> 00:43:04.648
Josh?

00:43:04.648 --> 00:43:06.190
AUDIENCE: You control
for experience.

00:43:06.190 --> 00:43:09.040
NANCY KANWISHER: You control
for experience, absolutely,

00:43:09.040 --> 00:43:10.870
like the Sugita paper.

00:43:10.870 --> 00:43:12.710
OK, so we'll get to
that in a second.

00:43:12.710 --> 00:43:14.800
So we started with these
key questions-- what

00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:16.420
is the initial state
at birth, and we

00:43:16.420 --> 00:43:20.620
showed impressive perceptual
abilities within a few days,

00:43:20.620 --> 00:43:23.530
although people dispute
whether those abilities are

00:43:23.530 --> 00:43:26.110
a face-specific system.

00:43:26.110 --> 00:43:28.600
And we don't know much about
what that system is, other

00:43:28.600 --> 00:43:31.510
than it works surprisingly
well given the low acuity.

00:43:31.510 --> 00:43:33.430
And we showed that how
it changes after that,

00:43:33.430 --> 00:43:36.940
there's perceptual narrowing
between six and 12 months,

00:43:36.940 --> 00:43:39.910
but a great deal is not known
about what happens then.

00:43:39.910 --> 00:43:41.710
And so now, we're
onto this question

00:43:41.710 --> 00:43:45.220
of how are we going
to un-confound

00:43:45.220 --> 00:43:47.140
what changes after
birth, whether it's

00:43:47.140 --> 00:43:48.718
maturation or experience.

00:43:48.718 --> 00:43:50.260
And I'm not going
to have time to get

00:43:50.260 --> 00:43:51.552
to these other awesome methods.

00:43:51.552 --> 00:43:53.920
We're going to focus on
controlled rearing, of what you

00:43:53.920 --> 00:43:55.540
read the Sugita paper.

00:43:55.540 --> 00:43:58.750
OK, so just to remind you
of the basics, most of you

00:43:58.750 --> 00:44:00.260
seemed to get the
paper just fine.

00:44:00.260 --> 00:44:02.980
The big idea was again, using
this preferential looking

00:44:02.980 --> 00:44:04.870
method, what Sugita et al.

00:44:04.870 --> 00:44:08.350
Showed is that when they
reared monkeys for six, 12,

00:44:08.350 --> 00:44:11.080
or 24 months without ever
letting them see a face,

00:44:11.080 --> 00:44:13.600
and then tested them on
the very first session

00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:19.180
that they ever saw faces
with preferential looking,

00:44:19.180 --> 00:44:21.730
they found that on the very
first exposure to faces,

00:44:21.730 --> 00:44:25.370
the monkeys looked more at
faces compared to novel objects,

00:44:25.370 --> 00:44:25.870
right?

00:44:25.870 --> 00:44:29.050
They showed that face
preference, sort of akin

00:44:29.050 --> 00:44:32.770
to infants looking
at the paddle,

00:44:32.770 --> 00:44:35.740
and they discriminated
between faces--

00:44:35.740 --> 00:44:39.250
very similar faces--
with adult-like accuracy.

00:44:39.250 --> 00:44:41.570
And this part, I don't know
if you found it surprising,

00:44:41.570 --> 00:44:44.500
but when this paper came
out I, was like, whoa,

00:44:44.500 --> 00:44:46.270
that is crazy, right?

00:44:46.270 --> 00:44:49.660
Because as I said, the whole
space of sensible hypotheses

00:44:49.660 --> 00:44:52.090
is, OK, maybe a lot
of stuff is innate,

00:44:52.090 --> 00:44:54.580
but you're still going to
need experience to tone it up,

00:44:54.580 --> 00:44:55.750
for God's sake, right?

00:44:55.750 --> 00:44:59.560
Who would think the entire
adult ability could exist

00:44:59.560 --> 00:45:01.122
without any experience at all?

00:45:01.122 --> 00:45:02.830
So I don't know if
you had that reaction,

00:45:02.830 --> 00:45:04.455
but I think that's
a sensible reaction.

00:45:04.455 --> 00:45:07.900
It's a pretty astonishing
finding in that paper.

00:45:07.900 --> 00:45:10.390
Unfortunately, there's
one author on that paper.

00:45:10.390 --> 00:45:13.750
It was done once, and it's
such a labor-intensive study

00:45:13.750 --> 00:45:16.340
that probably nobody will
ever try to replicate it.

00:45:16.340 --> 00:45:19.690
So in the back of many
people's minds is like, really?

00:45:19.690 --> 00:45:23.060
Can that really be true, or
is there something funny here?

00:45:23.060 --> 00:45:26.780
So I hope somebody
replicates it someday,

00:45:26.780 --> 00:45:28.780
but it hasn't been done yet.

00:45:28.780 --> 00:45:31.240
OK, the other thing that
you guys presumably noticed

00:45:31.240 --> 00:45:33.430
is there was perceptual
narrowing in that study.

00:45:33.430 --> 00:45:34.835
There were many interesting
things in there.

00:45:34.835 --> 00:45:36.340
It's actually
quite a rich paper.

00:45:36.340 --> 00:45:39.710
But after the initial
testing session,

00:45:39.710 --> 00:45:41.380
no matter how long
the deprivation,

00:45:41.380 --> 00:45:45.220
the monkeys were then housed in
either an environment with just

00:45:45.220 --> 00:45:47.470
humans or just monkeys.

00:45:47.470 --> 00:45:49.810
And so whether that
was 6, 12, or 24 months

00:45:49.810 --> 00:45:53.860
after birth of face
deprivation, they then

00:45:53.860 --> 00:45:56.230
lost their ability,
at that point,

00:45:56.230 --> 00:45:59.640
to discriminate the
unexperienced faces, OK?

00:45:59.640 --> 00:46:01.390
So they went through
perceptual narrowing.

00:46:01.390 --> 00:46:02.890
Does that all make
sense to you guys?

00:46:02.890 --> 00:46:03.460
You got that?

00:46:03.460 --> 00:46:04.510
Good.

00:46:04.510 --> 00:46:06.940
OK, all right.

00:46:06.940 --> 00:46:09.820
So anyway, that suggests
that an awful lot of the face

00:46:09.820 --> 00:46:13.630
perception system is present
without any exposure to faces,

00:46:13.630 --> 00:46:15.940
and that's pretty astonishing.

00:46:15.940 --> 00:46:17.800
What experience
seems to do there

00:46:17.800 --> 00:46:20.620
is not create abilities,
but eliminate them

00:46:20.620 --> 00:46:24.070
right for the species
that you don't see.

00:46:24.070 --> 00:46:27.610
OK, so first
reaction is, really?

00:46:27.610 --> 00:46:29.050
Second reaction,
is there any way

00:46:29.050 --> 00:46:32.680
to account for this in terms of
some non-face-specific system?

00:46:32.680 --> 00:46:34.600
I think you can, but
it takes some work,

00:46:34.600 --> 00:46:37.797
and the counter-explanations are
really difficult. You can say,

00:46:37.797 --> 00:46:39.880
well, maybe this is all
being carried by some more

00:46:39.880 --> 00:46:42.640
generic object system.

00:46:42.640 --> 00:46:45.790
They didn't test inverted
faces, unfortunately,

00:46:45.790 --> 00:46:48.500
but if it was carried by
a generic object system,

00:46:48.500 --> 00:46:50.500
why would you find the
perceptual narrowing?

00:46:50.500 --> 00:46:52.120
Why would they have
lost their ability

00:46:52.120 --> 00:46:54.410
for the unexperienced species?

00:46:54.410 --> 00:46:56.793
So I think that story
is hard to tell.

00:46:56.793 --> 00:46:58.210
And, of course,
the other question

00:46:58.210 --> 00:46:59.668
I'm sure you guys
are wondering is,

00:46:59.668 --> 00:47:01.630
what is going on in
those monkeys' brains?

00:47:01.630 --> 00:47:04.810
Yeah, OK, so let's get to that.

00:47:04.810 --> 00:47:07.080
Let's talk about what we
know about development

00:47:07.080 --> 00:47:10.268
of this system by
looking at brains.

00:47:10.268 --> 00:47:12.060
And first of all,
there's been lots of work

00:47:12.060 --> 00:47:16.840
on this in older kids, age 5 and
up, going back over a decade.

00:47:16.840 --> 00:47:19.380
And it's now clear that
all of that basic machinery

00:47:19.380 --> 00:47:23.550
I showed you is present by age
five, in most kids age five.

00:47:23.550 --> 00:47:25.870
It's continuing to
change after that,

00:47:25.870 --> 00:47:29.460
but you can detect most of
that stuff by age five, or six,

00:47:29.460 --> 00:47:31.090
or seven-- something like that.

00:47:31.090 --> 00:47:34.470
OK, trouble is, that's
cool, but age five

00:47:34.470 --> 00:47:38.070
is late with respect to
experience and with respect

00:47:38.070 --> 00:47:40.830
to all those behavioral
abilities that I showed you.

00:47:40.830 --> 00:47:43.800
So we need to go earlier.

00:47:43.800 --> 00:47:46.020
And so a couple of years
ago, Rebecca Sachs--

00:47:46.020 --> 00:47:50.790
who's straight up
there, two floors up--

00:47:50.790 --> 00:47:52.770
started scanning infants, OK?

00:47:52.770 --> 00:47:56.400
And this is-- as Heather can
tell you-- almost impossible.

00:47:56.400 --> 00:47:59.040
It is right on the edge.

00:47:59.040 --> 00:48:02.010
It took Rebecca and her lab
many, many years of work

00:48:02.010 --> 00:48:05.498
over five years just to
get the system going.

00:48:05.498 --> 00:48:07.290
There were all kinds
of technical advances,

00:48:07.290 --> 00:48:10.440
like making scanning coils
that were optimized for infants

00:48:10.440 --> 00:48:13.020
and comfortable for infants.

00:48:13.020 --> 00:48:14.790
Rebecca herself went
to great lengths,

00:48:14.790 --> 00:48:18.390
including producing some
of her own subjects.

00:48:18.390 --> 00:48:21.930
That's her son Arthur
there and her two--

00:48:21.930 --> 00:48:25.470
her grad student and postdoc
who were working with her.

00:48:25.470 --> 00:48:27.750
But all of this massive
effort was worth it,

00:48:27.750 --> 00:48:31.050
because what they found
was, first, for comparison,

00:48:31.050 --> 00:48:35.010
this is adults with a contrast
of faces versus scenes, OK?

00:48:35.010 --> 00:48:39.180
So this is basically the PPA in
blue responding more to scenes,

00:48:39.180 --> 00:48:42.480
and the FFA in here and some
other face-selective bits

00:48:42.480 --> 00:48:45.100
responding more to
faces in adults.

00:48:45.100 --> 00:48:47.580
What do you see in
six-month-old infants?

00:48:47.580 --> 00:48:49.990
It's astonishingly
similar, right?

00:48:49.990 --> 00:48:53.430
You can really see a
very similar layout

00:48:53.430 --> 00:48:55.410
of the functional
organization of the brain

00:48:55.410 --> 00:48:58.740
already by six months.

00:48:58.740 --> 00:49:00.180
So that's a huge advance.

00:49:00.180 --> 00:49:02.895
That pushes way back
the timeline by which

00:49:02.895 --> 00:49:04.020
these things had developed.

00:49:04.020 --> 00:49:05.812
Previously, everybody
is talking about, oh,

00:49:05.812 --> 00:49:07.560
what changes after age five?

00:49:07.560 --> 00:49:09.340
Age five, come on?

00:49:09.340 --> 00:49:11.670
OK, it's mostly
there by age six.

00:49:11.670 --> 00:49:17.160
OK, now, importantly, these
systems are not adult-like.

00:49:17.160 --> 00:49:18.810
Their selectivities
are very different.

00:49:18.810 --> 00:49:20.960
Those regions are less
selective in infants

00:49:20.960 --> 00:49:21.960
than they are in adults.

00:49:21.960 --> 00:49:26.982
But the spatial layout is
there already by six months,

00:49:26.982 --> 00:49:28.440
and that, importantly,
constrains--

00:49:28.440 --> 00:49:30.090
whatever our model
is of development

00:49:30.090 --> 00:49:31.860
that pushes it way back.

00:49:31.860 --> 00:49:34.530
OK, so now, the
next questions are,

00:49:34.530 --> 00:49:36.330
what is it about that region--

00:49:36.330 --> 00:49:37.830
or those particular
regions-- that

00:49:37.830 --> 00:49:43.230
makes them become face-specific
already by six months?

00:49:43.230 --> 00:49:45.060
How does the face
system know to take up

00:49:45.060 --> 00:49:48.370
residence in that systematic
location in the brain,

00:49:48.370 --> 00:49:49.840
and what is the
role of experience

00:49:49.840 --> 00:49:51.400
in their construction?

00:49:51.400 --> 00:49:53.920
And how could we
ever answer this?

00:49:53.920 --> 00:49:57.520
One way to answer that is
to use an animal model, OK?

00:49:57.520 --> 00:50:00.380
So there's been-- yes.

00:50:00.380 --> 00:50:02.750
AUDIENCE: OK, yeah,
similar question about--

00:50:02.750 --> 00:50:04.500
NANCY KANWISHER: I'm
sorry, I didn't hear.

00:50:04.500 --> 00:50:04.950
About what?

00:50:04.950 --> 00:50:06.408
AUDIENCE: General
physical layout--

00:50:06.408 --> 00:50:10.260
like why does your stomach
always come in the same place,

00:50:10.260 --> 00:50:13.920
and would it maybe be
the same mechanism that

00:50:13.920 --> 00:50:17.670
guides development of any organs
and the layout of the body,

00:50:17.670 --> 00:50:19.450
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:50:19.450 --> 00:50:20.440
NANCY KANWISHER: Yes.

00:50:20.440 --> 00:50:23.770
Now, I don't know much about how
hearts, and kidneys, and livers

00:50:23.770 --> 00:50:28.270
develop, but my understanding
is that's pretty much wired in.

00:50:28.270 --> 00:50:33.280
There's some chunks of DNA that
tell you how to build a kidney

00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:35.380
and where to put it
in your body, right?

00:50:35.380 --> 00:50:37.600
And so that is one of
the hypotheses here.

00:50:37.600 --> 00:50:39.400
It's a tempting
hypothesis, right?

00:50:39.400 --> 00:50:40.750
There's all that structure.

00:50:40.750 --> 00:50:43.690
It's a very tempting
hypothesis, but that doesn't

00:50:43.690 --> 00:50:45.340
mean it's necessarily right.

00:50:45.340 --> 00:50:46.705
Yeah, it absolutely is.

00:50:46.705 --> 00:50:50.140
It's a hypothesis we should
consider and take seriously,

00:50:50.140 --> 00:50:50.980
yeah.

00:50:50.980 --> 00:50:52.930
OK, so but we want data.

00:50:52.930 --> 00:50:53.890
We want to find out.

00:50:53.890 --> 00:50:55.900
OK, so animal models.

00:50:55.900 --> 00:50:58.803
So starting a few years
ago, Marge Livingstone over

00:50:58.803 --> 00:51:00.220
at Harvard Med
School over there--

00:51:00.220 --> 00:51:02.140
a couple of miles over there--

00:51:02.140 --> 00:51:04.270
started doing these
also really amazingly

00:51:04.270 --> 00:51:07.388
heroic studies where she
was scanning infant monkeys.

00:51:07.388 --> 00:51:08.930
OK, now, this is
really hard to read,

00:51:08.930 --> 00:51:10.540
so let me tell you
what we got here.

00:51:10.540 --> 00:51:12.320
We have the cortex.

00:51:12.320 --> 00:51:14.740
This is all the same animal
at different time points,

00:51:14.740 --> 00:51:16.720
and each of these
things is the cortex

00:51:16.720 --> 00:51:18.670
unfolded mathematically
and flattened

00:51:18.670 --> 00:51:20.240
so you can see the whole thing.

00:51:20.240 --> 00:51:21.907
I don't expect you
to know what's where.

00:51:21.907 --> 00:51:23.710
I can barely tell myself.

00:51:23.710 --> 00:51:27.970
But if you look at it, what
you see is at 81 days of age,

00:51:27.970 --> 00:51:29.200
there's just blue stuff.

00:51:29.200 --> 00:51:31.030
There's no orange stuff.

00:51:31.030 --> 00:51:34.030
The orange stuff is the
face-selective response.

00:51:34.030 --> 00:51:35.530
In fact, if you
look down, you start

00:51:35.530 --> 00:51:38.400
to see, oh, that looks--
yeah, yeah, OK, that

00:51:38.400 --> 00:51:39.400
looks pretty systematic.

00:51:39.400 --> 00:51:41.770
It starts replicating
after that.

00:51:41.770 --> 00:51:45.490
And so the claim is you
don't see face selectivity

00:51:45.490 --> 00:51:49.120
until about 170 days
after birth in monkeys.

00:51:49.120 --> 00:51:50.410
OK, that's about here.

00:51:50.410 --> 00:51:52.390
Here's another monkey
for comparison.

00:51:52.390 --> 00:51:53.920
If you stare at
it, you'll see, OK,

00:51:53.920 --> 00:51:56.710
there's these systematic
bits-- boom, boom, boom, boom--

00:51:56.710 --> 00:52:00.130
and maybe a little hint
at 170, but-- there's

00:52:00.130 --> 00:52:03.700
some garbage up there, but
nothing systematic before that.

00:52:03.700 --> 00:52:04.330
Yeah?

00:52:04.330 --> 00:52:06.970
AUDIENCE: So there's no
control of the environment?

00:52:06.970 --> 00:52:08.950
This is like monkeys--

00:52:08.950 --> 00:52:10.420
NANCY KANWISHER:
Normal monkeys who

00:52:10.420 --> 00:52:13.690
have exposure to human faces
and monkey faces hanging out

00:52:13.690 --> 00:52:14.412
in the lab, yeah.

00:52:14.412 --> 00:52:16.120
We haven't gotten to
control rearing yet.

00:52:16.120 --> 00:52:16.930
It's coming.

00:52:16.930 --> 00:52:20.310
OK, first thing is just, when
does it develop in monkeys?

00:52:20.310 --> 00:52:21.520
OK, all right.

00:52:21.520 --> 00:52:24.760
So are you surprised by this?

00:52:24.760 --> 00:52:27.550
It's not there here,
and it is there there.

00:52:27.550 --> 00:52:29.120
You should be surprised.

00:52:29.120 --> 00:52:30.130
Why are you surprised?

00:52:33.417 --> 00:52:34.750
This is what you guys predicted.

00:52:34.750 --> 00:52:36.910
Quiley?

00:52:36.910 --> 00:52:39.160
AUDIENCE: I guess I'm
surprised because they

00:52:39.160 --> 00:52:40.520
were able to discriminate.

00:52:40.520 --> 00:52:43.800
NANCY KANWISHER: Yeah,
what is up with that?

00:52:43.800 --> 00:52:45.180
Absolutely!

00:52:45.180 --> 00:52:47.730
The Sugida paper really made
it look like that system was

00:52:47.730 --> 00:52:49.020
innate, right?

00:52:49.020 --> 00:52:50.490
No experience-- boom!

00:52:50.490 --> 00:52:51.070
They're fine.

00:52:51.070 --> 00:52:53.790
It was just behavior, but it
was a good behavioral study.

00:52:53.790 --> 00:52:57.640
So why the hell isn't it here?

00:52:57.640 --> 00:53:01.570
Everybody with the program
on how surprising that is?

00:53:01.570 --> 00:53:04.250
OK, so a bunch of things.

00:53:04.250 --> 00:53:06.850
First of all-- and it
gets stable after that,

00:53:06.850 --> 00:53:08.350
and replicable.

00:53:08.350 --> 00:53:11.380
Well, the first thing is
one's a behavioral measure,

00:53:11.380 --> 00:53:12.970
and one's a neural measure.

00:53:12.970 --> 00:53:15.100
Maybe those fabulous
behavioral measures

00:53:15.100 --> 00:53:18.520
weren't actually being driven
by some face-specific system.

00:53:18.520 --> 00:53:20.140
Wouldn't that be sad, right?

00:53:20.140 --> 00:53:21.640
I mean, they did
lots of controls.

00:53:21.640 --> 00:53:22.810
It was a nice idea.

00:53:22.810 --> 00:53:25.360
I thought they did as well
as they could, but who knows?

00:53:25.360 --> 00:53:28.188
Maybe those monkeys
could do that task

00:53:28.188 --> 00:53:30.730
with some other system and they
didn't need their face system

00:53:30.730 --> 00:53:31.670
for it.

00:53:31.670 --> 00:53:33.250
That's one possibility, right?

00:53:33.250 --> 00:53:35.980
Then, you could have the face
system not develop till later,

00:53:35.980 --> 00:53:38.440
but the monkeys
could do it before.

00:53:38.440 --> 00:53:42.640
But the other thing
is, notice that Sugita

00:53:42.640 --> 00:53:46.450
didn't test their monkeys
until, with the youngest ones,

00:53:46.450 --> 00:53:49.310
six months of age.

00:53:49.310 --> 00:53:53.740
So maybe it just got
wired up just before--

00:53:53.740 --> 00:53:56.440
right there-- they
were tested, OK?

00:53:56.440 --> 00:53:57.940
So it seemed
contradictory at first,

00:53:57.940 --> 00:54:02.930
but it's not completely,
literally contradictory, yeah?

00:54:02.930 --> 00:54:10.130
OK, all right, so now, the fact
that this stuff doesn't show up

00:54:10.130 --> 00:54:14.930
until here, does that mean
that this face system requires

00:54:14.930 --> 00:54:15.905
experience to develop?

00:54:19.990 --> 00:54:22.770
You know the answer, because
whenever I ask that question,

00:54:22.770 --> 00:54:24.660
the answer is always no.

00:54:24.660 --> 00:54:28.530
Why does that not imply
that you need experience

00:54:28.530 --> 00:54:30.000
with faces to wire up?

00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:30.690
It's tempting.

00:54:30.690 --> 00:54:31.680
You look at it,
and it's like, OK,

00:54:31.680 --> 00:54:33.240
you had to look at
faces all this time

00:54:33.240 --> 00:54:34.198
before you wired it up.

00:54:34.198 --> 00:54:35.190
Boom, there it is--

00:54:35.190 --> 00:54:37.300
very tempting.

00:54:37.300 --> 00:54:39.210
But-- is it Jessica, no?

00:54:39.210 --> 00:54:40.770
Sorry, what's your name?

00:54:40.770 --> 00:54:41.270
Yeah.

00:54:41.270 --> 00:54:42.320
AUDIENCE: Bele.

00:54:42.320 --> 00:54:42.672
NANCY KANWISHER: Bele.

00:54:42.672 --> 00:54:44.600
Oh, sorry, you told me
that like six times.

00:54:44.600 --> 00:54:48.465
AUDIENCE: I could be merely
due to mature, physical.

00:54:48.465 --> 00:54:50.590
NANCY KANWISHER: Yeah, it
could be just maturation.

00:54:50.590 --> 00:54:53.090
I keep making the same point,
because it's important, right?

00:54:53.090 --> 00:54:54.700
Just because it shows
up later doesn't

00:54:54.700 --> 00:54:56.500
mean it's learned, right?

00:54:56.500 --> 00:54:58.660
Maybe it's like puberty,
or height, or something

00:54:58.660 --> 00:55:00.868
like that that's on some
developmental program that's

00:55:00.868 --> 00:55:04.450
just going to unfold
independent of what you see, OK?

00:55:04.450 --> 00:55:07.330
So how would we find out?

00:55:07.330 --> 00:55:08.860
We would do controlled rearing.

00:55:08.860 --> 00:55:12.520
And that's exactly what
these guys did, OK?

00:55:12.520 --> 00:55:16.180
So in another paper that just
came out a couple of years ago,

00:55:16.180 --> 00:55:19.030
they raised baby monkeys without
ever letting them see a face.

00:55:19.030 --> 00:55:21.760
Much like Sugita did,
they use welder's masks

00:55:21.760 --> 00:55:24.100
every time they were in the
lab, so the monkeys never

00:55:24.100 --> 00:55:25.300
got to see faces.

00:55:25.300 --> 00:55:27.520
And like Sugita,
they went to lengths

00:55:27.520 --> 00:55:29.260
to treat the monkeys nicely.

00:55:29.260 --> 00:55:31.720
They heard the calls
of their com-specifics,

00:55:31.720 --> 00:55:35.080
they got lots of attention,
they had rich visual experience.

00:55:35.080 --> 00:55:36.610
They just didn't see faces.

00:55:36.610 --> 00:55:38.828
So it sounds kind of tragic
and horrible at first,

00:55:38.828 --> 00:55:40.120
but it's actually not that bad.

00:55:40.120 --> 00:55:42.490
They had social contact
and visual experience.

00:55:42.490 --> 00:55:45.520
They just never saw faces--

00:55:45.520 --> 00:55:47.620
both this study and
the Sugita study.

00:55:47.620 --> 00:55:53.200
All right, OK, so they could
hear and smell other monkeys.

00:55:53.200 --> 00:55:56.050
So the face-deprived
monkeys saw no faces at all

00:55:56.050 --> 00:55:58.250
until 90 days old.

00:55:58.250 --> 00:56:01.420
And at that point, they went
straight into the scanner, OK?

00:56:01.420 --> 00:56:03.820
And the first time they
saw faces was inside an MRI

00:56:03.820 --> 00:56:07.480
machine getting scanned, OK?

00:56:07.480 --> 00:56:08.610
So what do you think?

00:56:08.610 --> 00:56:11.395
Are the face-deprived monkeys
going to show face patches?

00:56:16.513 --> 00:56:18.055
So there's no way
to tell, because we

00:56:18.055 --> 00:56:23.350
have all these contradictory
bits of evidence here, right?

00:56:23.350 --> 00:56:25.255
From Sugita, you
might think yes.

00:56:29.830 --> 00:56:30.430
Hard to tell.

00:56:30.430 --> 00:56:32.030
So let's just look at the data.

00:56:32.030 --> 00:56:36.520
OK So here first is a normally
normally reared monkey

00:56:36.520 --> 00:56:39.370
260 days old just
for comparison.

00:56:39.370 --> 00:56:44.230
And those face patches in yellow
in two different monkeys here,

00:56:44.230 --> 00:56:46.720
B4 and B5, left and
right hemisphere.

00:56:46.720 --> 00:56:48.910
OK, so those yellow bits
are the face patches.

00:56:48.910 --> 00:56:51.910
OK, normal 260-day-old monkey.

00:56:51.910 --> 00:56:54.230
Now we're going to see
a face-deprived monkey,

00:56:54.230 --> 00:56:55.370
260 days old.

00:56:55.370 --> 00:56:58.180
This monkey was face-deprived
that entire time up

00:56:58.180 --> 00:56:59.680
until scanning.

00:56:59.680 --> 00:57:02.630
No face patches.

00:57:02.630 --> 00:57:08.460
The plot thickens-- no
face patches at all.

00:57:08.460 --> 00:57:11.670
So these guys published this
paper in a very high-profile

00:57:11.670 --> 00:57:13.200
journal and said--

00:57:13.200 --> 00:57:14.520
this is the title of paper--

00:57:14.520 --> 00:57:18.990
"Seeing faces is necessary for
face-domain formation," OK?

00:57:18.990 --> 00:57:21.860
Face domain just means
face-selective patch.

00:57:21.860 --> 00:57:24.860
OK, everybody see?

00:57:24.860 --> 00:57:28.880
You deprive them of face
experience, you don't see it.

00:57:28.880 --> 00:57:32.600
OK, that's pretty
interesting, and it strongly

00:57:32.600 --> 00:57:35.270
suggests that the face system
is not innate but depends

00:57:35.270 --> 00:57:39.620
on face experience, doesn't it?

00:57:39.620 --> 00:57:43.760
Rare case where the
answer is, yes, it does.

00:57:43.760 --> 00:57:48.210
And it feels like it contradicts
the Sugita finding, right?

00:57:48.210 --> 00:57:49.800
But not exactly.

00:57:49.800 --> 00:57:51.810
You could still wiggle
out of it, right?

00:57:51.810 --> 00:57:54.630
You could say, OK,
the thing that Sugita

00:57:54.630 --> 00:57:57.250
was studying doesn't
use those patches,

00:57:57.250 --> 00:57:58.800
so it's not flat
out contradictory.

00:57:58.800 --> 00:58:00.778
Sugita was measuring
behavior; these guys

00:58:00.778 --> 00:58:01.695
are looking at brains.

00:58:01.695 --> 00:58:04.230
So it's kind of unsatisfying,
but it's, in principle,

00:58:04.230 --> 00:58:06.600
possible.

00:58:06.600 --> 00:58:08.850
Me and everyone else has
been nudging these guys

00:58:08.850 --> 00:58:12.030
to run the Sugita behavioral
experiment on your monkeys,

00:58:12.030 --> 00:58:13.080
please!

00:58:13.080 --> 00:58:14.520
And I gather that's
getting going,

00:58:14.520 --> 00:58:16.935
but I haven't seen
any of the data yet.

00:58:16.935 --> 00:58:18.810
So we don't know how
that's going to resolve.

00:58:18.810 --> 00:58:20.937
OK, so let's take stock.

00:58:20.937 --> 00:58:22.020
What is the initial state?

00:58:22.020 --> 00:58:24.120
We show with behavior
that there is

00:58:24.120 --> 00:58:27.090
both attention to faces and--

00:58:27.090 --> 00:58:31.230
present in newborn humans, and
face specificity seems like it,

00:58:31.230 --> 00:58:34.890
but it's not totally nailed,
whereas functional MRI says

00:58:34.890 --> 00:58:37.830
there's no evidence for
face specificity at birth--

00:58:37.830 --> 00:58:39.720
at least in monkeys, right?

00:58:39.720 --> 00:58:40.740
That's other.

00:58:40.740 --> 00:58:42.870
Yeah, OK, so how are we
going to reconcile this

00:58:42.870 --> 00:58:45.090
with all the behavioral
results I showed you,

00:58:45.090 --> 00:58:47.340
that there seems to be
a lot of face abilities

00:58:47.340 --> 00:58:49.050
present in newborns?

00:58:49.050 --> 00:58:53.280
Well, one possibility is
that face specificity exists

00:58:53.280 --> 00:58:57.510
behaviorally, but MRI fails--
oh, sorry, face specificity

00:58:57.510 --> 00:59:00.850
exists in the brain, but
MRI fails to detect it.

00:59:00.850 --> 00:59:03.480
There's a whole rigmarole about
whether functional MRI works

00:59:03.480 --> 00:59:04.260
well in infants.

00:59:04.260 --> 00:59:06.000
It's barely possible,
as I mentioned.

00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:07.890
It's also hard with
infant monkeys.

00:59:07.890 --> 00:59:10.020
Their blood flow
regulation is different.

00:59:10.020 --> 00:59:12.270
They're squirming and wiggling.

00:59:12.270 --> 00:59:14.430
There are a million issues
with scanning babies,

00:59:14.430 --> 00:59:15.580
whether human or monkey.

00:59:15.580 --> 00:59:17.580
And so you could always
say, well, it was there,

00:59:17.580 --> 00:59:19.740
and just the MRI data
are just kind of crappy,

00:59:19.740 --> 00:59:21.840
or blood flow
regulation to the brain

00:59:21.840 --> 00:59:25.290
develops later-- an argument
many people have made.

00:59:25.290 --> 00:59:27.030
However, a paper was
published last week

00:59:27.030 --> 00:59:29.730
that argues against
that hypothesis.

00:59:29.730 --> 00:59:33.750
The same group just showed
that the somatosensory touch

00:59:33.750 --> 00:59:39.180
system is totally in place
by 11 days in baby monkeys.

00:59:39.180 --> 00:59:41.910
So that suggests that you can
get really nice functional MRI

00:59:41.910 --> 00:59:44.280
data at 11 days of
age in baby monkeys,

00:59:44.280 --> 00:59:46.650
and it makes it less
likely that this

00:59:46.650 --> 00:59:49.290
is some kind of spurious
failure to detect something

00:59:49.290 --> 00:59:51.810
that was actually there.

00:59:51.810 --> 00:59:54.060
I'm not going to test you
on every little detail here.

00:59:54.060 --> 00:59:55.810
I want you to think
about the logic of how

00:59:55.810 --> 00:59:58.770
you can ask these questions.

00:59:58.770 --> 01:00:01.677
OK, the other possibility
is that the face abilities

01:00:01.677 --> 01:00:04.260
that we showed behaviorally are
using some more generic object

01:00:04.260 --> 01:00:07.770
recognition system, not using
this face-selective system

01:00:07.770 --> 01:00:09.460
in the brain.

01:00:09.460 --> 01:00:12.950
OK, so how does it
change over time?

01:00:12.950 --> 01:00:14.650
Well, we showed
that behaviorally--

01:00:14.650 --> 01:00:16.510
in humans, at least--
all the hallmarks

01:00:16.510 --> 01:00:19.300
of face-specific processing
or present by age four,

01:00:19.300 --> 01:00:21.670
and we get this perceptual
narrowing between six and 12

01:00:21.670 --> 01:00:23.485
months.

01:00:23.485 --> 01:00:25.360
But then we showed that
with functional MRI--

01:00:25.360 --> 01:00:26.350
at least in monkeys--

01:00:26.350 --> 01:00:30.140
there's no evidence for face
specificity before 200 days,

01:00:30.140 --> 01:00:30.640
right?

01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:33.460
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

01:00:33.460 --> 01:00:36.280
NANCY KANWISHER: I gather
they're working on it,

01:00:36.280 --> 01:00:38.740
but I haven't seen any
of the data yet, yeah.

01:00:42.350 --> 01:00:45.980
OK, so that lack
of face specificity

01:00:45.980 --> 01:00:47.960
is consistent with
the idea that all

01:00:47.960 --> 01:00:50.690
that human early face
recognition behavior

01:00:50.690 --> 01:00:52.430
is driven by a
different system--

01:00:52.430 --> 01:00:55.610
because they don't have their
face system yet, presumably.

01:00:55.610 --> 01:00:58.490
But it's also consistent
with this idea

01:00:58.490 --> 01:01:01.340
that it's just failing
to be detected.

01:01:01.340 --> 01:01:03.530
Even though I said
that's probably not true,

01:01:03.530 --> 01:01:07.250
given you can detect other
stuff, it might be true here.

01:01:07.250 --> 01:01:09.190
The ability to see
things with MRI

01:01:09.190 --> 01:01:11.750
depends where you're
looking at the brain.

01:01:11.750 --> 01:01:15.320
OK, so what about
these causal roles

01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:20.210
of structured experience
and biological maturation?

01:01:20.210 --> 01:01:22.970
OK, so we argued that
early face experience

01:01:22.970 --> 01:01:25.160
isn't crucial for the
face recognition system.

01:01:25.160 --> 01:01:27.080
That was the Sugita
paper you read.

01:01:27.080 --> 01:01:30.530
But now, functional MRI is
showing that face experience

01:01:30.530 --> 01:01:34.070
is necessary for the development
of face patches, at least

01:01:34.070 --> 01:01:35.540
in monkeys.

01:01:35.540 --> 01:01:38.475
And so a very sensible
reaction, is what, what, what?

01:01:38.475 --> 01:01:40.100
How are we going to
make sense of this?

01:01:40.100 --> 01:01:41.983
This is a big conundrum.

01:01:41.983 --> 01:01:44.150
It's going to get worse on
Monday, where there's yet

01:01:44.150 --> 01:01:47.480
more contradictory data.

01:01:47.480 --> 01:01:52.750
And further, if that
face system isn't innate,

01:01:52.750 --> 01:01:57.670
then what, if anything, is
innate about face perception,

01:01:57.670 --> 01:01:58.210
right?

01:01:58.210 --> 01:02:04.070
So maybe what all these data are
telling us is, not that much.

01:02:04.070 --> 01:02:07.220
Maybe just a biased
look at faces,

01:02:07.220 --> 01:02:09.440
or some very simple
image template

01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:11.750
that's sufficient in the
environment of infants

01:02:11.750 --> 01:02:14.330
to get them to look at faces.

01:02:14.330 --> 01:02:16.280
So there's a lot of
studies I didn't have time

01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:18.680
to work into this lecture,
where people stick cameras

01:02:18.680 --> 01:02:21.560
on the foreheads of
newborns, and they

01:02:21.560 --> 01:02:24.560
collect, what is the typical
visual experience of a newborn?

01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:26.030
And then, you can take that--

01:02:26.030 --> 01:02:29.345
you can take that experience
and ask, what kind of--

01:02:29.345 --> 01:02:31.790
you can write
machine learning code

01:02:31.790 --> 01:02:34.700
to say, what would you have to
build in to reliably pick out

01:02:34.700 --> 01:02:37.820
the faces in typical
infant input?

01:02:37.820 --> 01:02:39.710
And it's probably
not that complicated,

01:02:39.710 --> 01:02:42.350
because infants don't see that
many different kinds of things,

01:02:42.350 --> 01:02:43.220
right?

01:02:43.220 --> 01:02:44.840
OK.

01:02:44.840 --> 01:02:47.930
We showed early visual
discrimination abilities

01:02:47.930 --> 01:02:50.030
of faces in newborn infants.

01:02:50.030 --> 01:02:51.770
But again, it's not
clear that's part

01:02:51.770 --> 01:02:54.218
of the face-specific system.

01:02:54.218 --> 01:02:55.760
And we showed that
the face patches--

01:02:55.760 --> 01:02:56.870
at least in monkeys--

01:02:56.870 --> 01:02:59.930
seem to require experience, OK?

01:02:59.930 --> 01:03:02.060
I'm just recapping here.

01:03:02.060 --> 01:03:03.980
But now, there's
this big question of,

01:03:03.980 --> 01:03:08.120
how do those face patches know
where to develop in the brain?

01:03:08.120 --> 01:03:11.030
Like here they are in humans,
these little purple blobs.

01:03:11.030 --> 01:03:14.270
The occipital face area I've
got two different fusiform face

01:03:14.270 --> 01:03:17.030
areas, because various
people think there's two.

01:03:17.030 --> 01:03:17.760
I'm not sure.

01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:19.260
I don't really care;
doesn't matter.

01:03:19.260 --> 01:03:22.180
Anyway, how do they know
to land right there?

01:03:22.180 --> 01:03:24.680
OK, we keep bringing up this
question and dancing around it,

01:03:24.680 --> 01:03:29.690
but so far, I've given no
basis for thinking about this.

01:03:29.690 --> 01:03:33.920
One possibility
is that infants--

01:03:33.920 --> 01:03:37.220
monkey and humans-- are
born with some earlier

01:03:37.220 --> 01:03:40.110
kind of selectivity of
that patch of brain.

01:03:40.110 --> 01:03:41.870
It's not a whole face template.

01:03:41.870 --> 01:03:43.700
It's not a whole face system.

01:03:43.700 --> 01:03:47.480
Maybe it's a bias for
curvy things, right?

01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:50.750
And then, somehow, that
makes the faces land there,

01:03:50.750 --> 01:03:52.340
and the system wires itself up.

01:03:52.340 --> 01:03:54.380
It's not exactly clear
how that would go.

01:03:54.380 --> 01:03:57.590
But that's one kind of story.

01:03:57.590 --> 01:03:59.208
Another story is
based on this fact

01:03:59.208 --> 01:04:01.250
I told you at the beginning
of the lecture, which

01:04:01.250 --> 01:04:04.670
is most of the long-range
connectivity of the brain is

01:04:04.670 --> 01:04:06.050
present at birth.

01:04:06.050 --> 01:04:08.270
And so maybe the
particular connections

01:04:08.270 --> 01:04:11.840
of that patch of brain are
already there at birth,

01:04:11.840 --> 01:04:13.760
and maybe that
patch of connections

01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:18.410
are sufficient to somehow
gate the input to that system

01:04:18.410 --> 01:04:24.130
and arrange for it to end
up being face-specific, OK?

01:04:24.130 --> 01:04:27.760
So this is a very active
area of investigation,

01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:31.482
and there's other very active,
ongoing kinds of investigation

01:04:31.482 --> 01:04:33.190
where people are trying
to understand how

01:04:33.190 --> 01:04:34.970
this development might work.

01:04:34.970 --> 01:04:36.580
One way people are
looking at this--

01:04:36.580 --> 01:04:38.122
I mentioned this
briefly, but I think

01:04:38.122 --> 01:04:40.210
it's super exciting--
is people are asking

01:04:40.210 --> 01:04:42.370
with deep nets and other
kinds of modeling, what

01:04:42.370 --> 01:04:45.940
do you have to build into a
system to get it to produce

01:04:45.940 --> 01:04:48.100
face recognition abilities?

01:04:48.100 --> 01:04:49.660
If you're trying
to make a deep net,

01:04:49.660 --> 01:04:52.060
you're trying to make it really
good at face recognition,

01:04:52.060 --> 01:04:54.970
do you need to give it
a template of faces?

01:04:54.970 --> 01:04:57.100
Do you need to give it
only experience with faces?

01:04:57.100 --> 01:04:58.990
What do you need to
build into it to get

01:04:58.990 --> 01:05:00.580
it to be really good, right?

01:05:00.580 --> 01:05:04.420
And so that's a very active
area of investigation.

01:05:04.420 --> 01:05:07.690
And you can actually-- with some
ongoing work with Jim DiCarlo's

01:05:07.690 --> 01:05:10.420
lab, we're asking, OK, deep
nets don't have topography.

01:05:10.420 --> 01:05:12.940
Next door units in a deep net
doesn't mean anything, what's

01:05:12.940 --> 01:05:14.320
next door versus far apart.

01:05:14.320 --> 01:05:16.282
Location doesn't mean
anything in a deep net,

01:05:16.282 --> 01:05:17.740
but you can make
it mean something.

01:05:17.740 --> 01:05:20.470
And then you can ask when,
and whether, and how,

01:05:20.470 --> 01:05:25.030
and why you get face patches
in a deep net and what

01:05:25.030 --> 01:05:26.980
computational role they serve.

01:05:26.980 --> 01:05:29.680
Well, totally weirdly,
I'm finishing early,

01:05:29.680 --> 01:05:31.000
but I'm not going to finish.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:32.417
I'll take questions,
and then I'll

01:05:32.417 --> 01:05:34.420
maybe add a little bit more.

01:05:34.420 --> 01:05:36.970
I think that was all
I had here, right.

01:05:36.970 --> 01:05:38.823
Any questions about all this?

01:05:38.823 --> 01:05:40.240
If it feels a
little bit chaotic--

01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:42.340
I've sort of said
x and not x, and x,

01:05:42.340 --> 01:05:44.620
although they're not
exactly x and not x.

01:05:44.620 --> 01:05:46.210
They're just-- yeah, Sirdul.

01:05:46.210 --> 01:05:49.600
AUDIENCE: So the fMRI tends
to [INAUDIBLE] activity

01:05:49.600 --> 01:05:51.100
in boxes, right?

01:05:51.100 --> 01:05:54.800
[INAUDIBLE] you said
contain millions of neurons.

01:05:54.800 --> 01:05:57.700
So is it possible
that the neurons

01:05:57.700 --> 01:06:00.730
that are specific to
faces are distributed

01:06:00.730 --> 01:06:03.430
at an early age throughout
the brain, and somehow

01:06:03.430 --> 01:06:05.323
the function for them--

01:06:05.323 --> 01:06:07.240
NANCY KANWISHER: They
get spatially clustered.

01:06:07.240 --> 01:06:08.990
AUDIENCE: Yeah, but
the neurons themselves

01:06:08.990 --> 01:06:10.483
already exist at birth?

01:06:10.483 --> 01:06:11.650
NANCY KANWISHER: Absolutely.

01:06:11.650 --> 01:06:12.850
That's a great hypothesis.

01:06:12.850 --> 01:06:13.930
It's absolutely possible.

01:06:13.930 --> 01:06:15.130
Everybody get the idea?

01:06:15.130 --> 01:06:17.560
You have all those
face neurons at birth,

01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:19.270
and maybe they're
face-specific at birth,

01:06:19.270 --> 01:06:21.250
but they're
spatially spread out.

01:06:21.250 --> 01:06:23.650
And then they have
to find each other

01:06:23.650 --> 01:06:25.390
and hang out together
next to each other

01:06:25.390 --> 01:06:27.130
before you ever
get an MRI signal.

01:06:27.130 --> 01:06:29.410
It's totally possible logically.

01:06:29.410 --> 01:06:32.290
It seems to be quite
unlikely actually,

01:06:32.290 --> 01:06:34.750
because it would be very
hard for all those neurons,

01:06:34.750 --> 01:06:36.792
with their necessary
connections-- which is,

01:06:36.792 --> 01:06:38.500
after all, how they
become face-specific,

01:06:38.500 --> 01:06:40.833
is what their inputs are and
what they're connected to--

01:06:40.833 --> 01:06:43.000
it'd be very hard for
them to migrate spatially

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.428
across the brain maintaining
their connections.

01:06:45.428 --> 01:06:46.720
Yes, you're going to push back?

01:06:46.720 --> 01:06:47.220
Go for it.

01:06:47.220 --> 01:06:50.200
AUDIENCE: Well, I
think [INAUDIBLE]

01:06:50.200 --> 01:06:52.680
But since you said
[INAUDIBLE],, they

01:06:52.680 --> 01:06:54.430
care about what their
neighbors are doing.

01:06:54.430 --> 01:06:57.100
So maybe it's just like
a neighboring neuron's

01:06:57.100 --> 01:07:00.820
properties, but the
[INAUDIBLE] in this chain

01:07:00.820 --> 01:07:03.610
moves it back until
that brief [INAUDIBLE]..

01:07:03.610 --> 01:07:06.910
But that progression is the
most efficient way to pop up.

01:07:06.910 --> 01:07:10.210
NANCY KANWISHER: It's totally
possible, totally possible,

01:07:10.210 --> 01:07:11.320
absolutely.

01:07:11.320 --> 01:07:13.870
Yep, other questions?

01:07:13.870 --> 01:07:15.010
And this is wide open.

01:07:15.010 --> 01:07:16.450
Nobody knows, right?

01:07:19.310 --> 01:07:21.635
Let me just see what else
I have time for briefly.

01:07:27.010 --> 01:07:28.600
So funny, I took
out all these slides

01:07:28.600 --> 01:07:31.240
because I just thought I'm
not going to run out of time,

01:07:31.240 --> 01:07:32.920
and go over, and
drive everyone crazy.

01:07:38.400 --> 01:07:41.820
I moved all this stuff
to the other lecture.

01:07:41.820 --> 01:07:42.765
Maybe I will just--

01:07:47.197 --> 01:07:48.780
All right, hang on,
let me just glance

01:07:48.780 --> 01:07:52.290
at the lineup for Wednesday.

01:07:54.900 --> 01:07:55.610
Yeah?

01:07:55.610 --> 01:07:58.650
AUDIENCE: Is there--
the perceptual narrowing

01:07:58.650 --> 01:08:02.430
is really surprising
and fascinating.

01:08:02.430 --> 01:08:09.240
Does anybody have a model for
how that processing might work

01:08:09.240 --> 01:08:10.950
or what it might be for?

01:08:10.950 --> 01:08:13.710
I mean, it feels
like a lot of it--

01:08:13.710 --> 01:08:17.850
assumptions, or the
common sense assumptions

01:08:17.850 --> 01:08:22.184
when we look at fMRI, and
when we look at neural signals

01:08:22.184 --> 01:08:25.470
is that they all
mean positive things.

01:08:25.470 --> 01:08:28.200
But maybe a lot of that
signals, a lot of activity

01:08:28.200 --> 01:08:29.939
might be inhibitory--

01:08:29.939 --> 01:08:31.828
might be the opposite.

01:08:31.828 --> 01:08:33.120
NANCY KANWISHER: Totally, yeah.

01:08:33.120 --> 01:08:35.760
But how would that explain
perceptual narrowing?

01:08:35.760 --> 01:08:38.880
AUDIENCE: Well, if what you're
learning is what to ignore,

01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:42.840
then maybe it takes a lot
of effort to ignore things.

01:08:42.840 --> 01:08:46.889
And not really sure.

01:08:46.889 --> 01:08:48.420
I'm not sure exactly, yeah.

01:08:48.420 --> 01:08:49.350
NANCY KANWISHER: No,
it's a good point.

01:08:49.350 --> 01:08:51.010
Like I mentioned
at the beginning,

01:08:51.010 --> 01:08:54.689
one of the limitations
of functional MRI

01:08:54.689 --> 01:08:57.120
is we don't know what the
actual neurophysiological basis

01:08:57.120 --> 01:08:58.450
of the bold signal is.

01:08:58.450 --> 01:09:01.649
It could be anything that
increases your metabolic costs,

01:09:01.649 --> 01:09:03.390
and hence changes blood flow.

01:09:03.390 --> 01:09:05.609
But one of the things that
increases metabolic costs

01:09:05.609 --> 01:09:07.979
is inhibiting other neurons.

01:09:07.979 --> 01:09:10.290
And so way back in the
early days of, actually,

01:09:10.290 --> 01:09:12.840
PET imaging, before
functional MRI came along,

01:09:12.840 --> 01:09:16.529
there was an early proto version
of a face-specific paper.

01:09:16.529 --> 01:09:20.760
It didn't nail everything,
but it was not bad for 1981,

01:09:20.760 --> 01:09:22.740
when I think it was published.

01:09:22.740 --> 01:09:24.270
And the person who
did that paper,

01:09:24.270 --> 01:09:29.310
Justine Sergent argued that
it's very, very ambiguous

01:09:29.310 --> 01:09:31.740
what it means to find
a hotspot in the brain

01:09:31.740 --> 01:09:33.930
where the activity--
the metabolic activity--

01:09:33.930 --> 01:09:36.571
is higher, say, when you
look at faces than objects.

01:09:36.571 --> 01:09:39.029
And her point was, that could
be the part of the brain that

01:09:39.029 --> 01:09:41.290
really sucks at
face recognition.

01:09:41.290 --> 01:09:42.750
That's the part
that's going, ah,

01:09:42.750 --> 01:09:44.160
I can't deal with this thing!

01:09:44.160 --> 01:09:45.700
What is this thing, right!

01:09:45.700 --> 01:09:48.359
That's really bad at it, and
the neurons are firing a lot.

01:09:48.359 --> 01:09:50.100
It's sort of facetious,
but sort of not.

01:09:50.100 --> 01:09:51.870
And it's probably not
the right account,

01:09:51.870 --> 01:09:54.180
but it is an important
reminder that we actually

01:09:54.180 --> 01:09:57.240
don't know what actual
kind of neural activity

01:09:57.240 --> 01:10:00.660
is driving those
things and whether it's

01:10:00.660 --> 01:10:03.258
excitatory or
inhibitory, absolutely.

01:10:03.258 --> 01:10:04.050
Hang on one second.

01:10:04.050 --> 01:10:05.580
I feel like there was
another part of what you said

01:10:05.580 --> 01:10:07.010
that I was going to engage on.

01:10:07.010 --> 01:10:09.120
AUDIENCE: No, It feels
like somehow, possibly,

01:10:09.120 --> 01:10:11.910
connected to the
perception [INAUDIBLE]..

01:10:11.910 --> 01:10:13.990
NANCY KANWISHER: Yeah.

01:10:13.990 --> 01:10:15.040
Yeah, possibly.

01:10:15.040 --> 01:10:17.800
We'd have to work it out.

01:10:17.800 --> 01:10:21.423
AUDIENCE: In one of the
lectures [INAUDIBLE],,

01:10:21.423 --> 01:10:22.340
NANCY KANWISHER: Yeah.

01:10:22.340 --> 01:10:28.290
AUDIENCE: And then, [INAUDIBLE]

01:10:28.290 --> 01:10:29.165
NANCY KANWISHER: Yes.

01:10:29.165 --> 01:10:30.855
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:10:30.855 --> 01:10:31.730
NANCY KANWISHER: Yes.

01:10:31.730 --> 01:10:32.940
AUDIENCE: Then,
I'm a bit confused,

01:10:32.940 --> 01:10:35.720
because, like, you said before,
almost like all the wiring is

01:10:35.720 --> 01:10:36.980
[INAUDIBLE].

01:10:36.980 --> 01:10:38.750
NANCY KANWISHER: OK,
long-range wiring.

01:10:38.750 --> 01:10:39.410
AUDIENCE: Oh.

01:10:39.410 --> 01:10:40.243
NANCY KANWISHER: OK?

01:10:40.243 --> 01:10:42.260
Which is very different
than all the circuits

01:10:42.260 --> 01:10:44.330
that live in each
little patch of cortex.

01:10:44.330 --> 01:10:47.840
Remember, I showed
you this big change

01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:53.180
in the complexity of neurons
and the number of connections.

01:10:53.180 --> 01:10:54.950
Oops, looks like
we've lost it now.

01:11:00.590 --> 01:11:04.130
So they're changing a lot within
each patch of cortex, right?

01:11:04.130 --> 01:11:06.530
So those local circuits
that are doing computations

01:11:06.530 --> 01:11:09.590
are surely changing a lot over
the first couple of years.

01:11:09.590 --> 01:11:11.960
It's just the long-range
connections between that patch

01:11:11.960 --> 01:11:13.490
and some remote region--

01:11:13.490 --> 01:11:17.390
where it gets its inputs and
where it sends its outputs to.

01:11:17.390 --> 01:11:18.290
But hang on a second.

01:11:18.290 --> 01:11:22.043
You asked something-- there's
also very interesting stuff

01:11:22.043 --> 01:11:23.210
about the other race effect.

01:11:23.210 --> 01:11:26.060
I did mention that a
month ago or so, didn't I?

01:11:26.060 --> 01:11:30.110
Which is another version of
this perceptual narrowing.

01:11:30.110 --> 01:11:33.415
And in fact, a friend of mine
who's a great face researcher

01:11:33.415 --> 01:11:34.790
has not yet
published this paper,

01:11:34.790 --> 01:11:35.957
but she found the following.

01:11:35.957 --> 01:11:38.780
Totally, that's right-- you
mentioned the adoption studies.

01:11:38.780 --> 01:11:40.845
So what she has done is ask--

01:11:40.845 --> 01:11:42.470
did I tell you guys
about this already?

01:11:42.470 --> 01:11:43.850
I feel like I did,
but maybe not.

01:11:43.850 --> 01:11:48.360
Anyway, so what you find
is that people are--

01:11:48.360 --> 01:11:49.670
they all look alike.

01:11:49.670 --> 01:11:52.340
Whoever they are, if
you've seen fewer of them

01:11:52.340 --> 01:11:55.580
than whoever we
are, you are less

01:11:55.580 --> 01:11:56.750
good at discriminating them.

01:11:56.750 --> 01:11:57.920
That's just what it is.

01:11:57.920 --> 01:12:02.120
But so Elinor McKone
asked if there's

01:12:02.120 --> 01:12:05.000
a developmental timeline
for getting your way out

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:06.960
of the other race effect.

01:12:06.960 --> 01:12:09.380
And so what she did
was-- she's in Australia,

01:12:09.380 --> 01:12:11.270
and she got various
communities of people

01:12:11.270 --> 01:12:14.210
who move from dominant
racial composition

01:12:14.210 --> 01:12:16.700
x to dominant
racial composition y

01:12:16.700 --> 01:12:20.880
and who made that move
at different ages.

01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:22.790
And so what she finds
is that, actually,

01:12:22.790 --> 01:12:25.580
much like learning the
phonemes of a language-- which,

01:12:25.580 --> 01:12:27.556
even if you--

01:12:27.556 --> 01:12:29.202
hey, let me back up a second.

01:12:29.202 --> 01:12:31.160
I said that with phonemes,
you can discriminate

01:12:31.160 --> 01:12:33.758
all those phonemes of all the
world's languages at birth,

01:12:33.758 --> 01:12:35.300
and by six months,
you've thrown away

01:12:35.300 --> 01:12:36.802
the abilities for
all the phonemes

01:12:36.802 --> 01:12:37.760
you can't discriminate.

01:12:37.760 --> 01:12:41.480
However, if you then go learn
a foreign language sometime

01:12:41.480 --> 01:12:44.360
between six months
and, say, 12, you

01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:45.540
can become a native speaker.

01:12:45.540 --> 01:12:46.880
So you can learn
them back, right?

01:12:46.880 --> 01:12:48.338
So there's another
window-- it gets

01:12:48.338 --> 01:12:51.950
narrowed-- but you still have a
window to learn them back, OK?

01:12:51.950 --> 01:12:55.460
After you're like 12,
15, whatever, forget it.

01:12:55.460 --> 01:12:57.380
You won't be a native
speaker, right?

01:12:57.380 --> 01:12:59.012
Same deal with the
other race effect.

01:12:59.012 --> 01:13:01.220
This is exactly what McKone
found with the other race

01:13:01.220 --> 01:13:02.240
effect.

01:13:02.240 --> 01:13:08.330
People who moved to a different
dominant racial community

01:13:08.330 --> 01:13:11.420
learned the ability to
natively discriminate people

01:13:11.420 --> 01:13:15.020
in that other race if
they moved before age 12.

01:13:15.020 --> 01:13:17.277
So it really seems like
there's some general ability.

01:13:17.277 --> 01:13:18.860
Oh, I remember David's
other question.

01:13:18.860 --> 01:13:20.130
Why does this make sense?

01:13:20.130 --> 01:13:21.797
I don't know exactly
why it makes sense,

01:13:21.797 --> 01:13:26.570
but certainly, neural activity
is expensive metabolically,

01:13:26.570 --> 01:13:28.310
and we don't want to
make discriminations

01:13:28.310 --> 01:13:29.750
we don't have to.

01:13:29.750 --> 01:13:32.990
And so it can be just that
the nervous system is learning

01:13:32.990 --> 01:13:34.790
what kinds of
discriminations it needs

01:13:34.790 --> 01:13:37.487
to make in its environment and
what kind it doesn't, right?

01:13:37.487 --> 01:13:39.320
And with the case of
phonemes, it's actually

01:13:39.320 --> 01:13:41.360
part of what you're doing
in speech perception,

01:13:41.360 --> 01:13:45.110
is you want to know,
every time I say "ba,"

01:13:45.110 --> 01:13:47.130
it sounds different in
all different contexts.

01:13:47.130 --> 01:13:50.030
And so part of the essence
of the difficulty in speech

01:13:50.030 --> 01:13:52.520
recognition is understanding
that all those different "ba"s

01:13:52.520 --> 01:13:54.980
are the same sound, right?

01:13:54.980 --> 01:13:57.650
And so part of what perceptual
narrowing might be doing

01:13:57.650 --> 01:13:59.210
is saying all those things--

01:13:59.210 --> 01:14:02.180
"da," "ta," whatever
it is in Hindi--

01:14:02.180 --> 01:14:04.738
those are all going to
count as the same thing.

01:14:04.738 --> 01:14:06.530
And that's going to
help you process speech

01:14:06.530 --> 01:14:09.140
in your native language
but hinder when you try

01:14:09.140 --> 01:14:12.630
to learn a foreign language.

01:14:12.630 --> 01:14:13.130
Yeah?

01:14:13.130 --> 01:14:14.630
AUDIENCE: So something
I'm wondering

01:14:14.630 --> 01:14:18.620
with perceptual narrowing is how
general like the starting point

01:14:18.620 --> 01:14:19.120
is.

01:14:19.120 --> 01:14:21.287
So I'm basically wondering--
because in the studies,

01:14:21.287 --> 01:14:22.920
they compared human
and monkey faces.

01:14:22.920 --> 01:14:23.300
NANCY KANWISHER: Yeah.

01:14:23.300 --> 01:14:24.883
AUDIENCE: And I'm
wondering if there's

01:14:24.883 --> 01:14:28.110
any correlation with
how similar the DNA,

01:14:28.110 --> 01:14:31.310
like how they're able to
discriminate between the faces.

01:14:31.310 --> 01:14:33.800
So whether that's
different types of monkeys,

01:14:33.800 --> 01:14:35.300
or different animals--

01:14:35.300 --> 01:14:37.092
NANCY KANWISHER: I'm
not getting it, right?

01:14:37.092 --> 01:14:39.650
Early on, you can
discriminate both, right?

01:14:39.650 --> 01:14:40.860
So what's the question?

01:14:40.860 --> 01:14:43.220
AUDIENCE: So I'm wondering
what other animals can they

01:14:43.220 --> 01:14:44.090
discriminate, and what--

01:14:44.090 --> 01:14:44.750
NANCY KANWISHER: I see, I see.

01:14:44.750 --> 01:14:45.710
How far does it go?

01:14:45.710 --> 01:14:47.430
Yeah, good question.

01:14:47.430 --> 01:14:50.750
I don't know that anybody
has asked little kids if they

01:14:50.750 --> 01:14:56.030
can discriminate other kinds of
faces other than monkey faces.

01:14:56.030 --> 01:14:58.970
I'm sure there's some limit
to it-- like fish faces?

01:14:58.970 --> 01:15:03.410
Probably, I don't know, yeah.

01:15:03.410 --> 01:15:05.877
But there's also, actually,
in terms of that extended--

01:15:05.877 --> 01:15:07.460
I don't know the
answer to that, yeah.

01:15:07.460 --> 01:15:09.080
There's going to be some limit.

01:15:09.080 --> 01:15:14.240
But in terms of the
question of how long

01:15:14.240 --> 01:15:17.030
can you relearn those
abilities or maintain them,

01:15:17.030 --> 01:15:19.910
it's not like
perceptual narrowing

01:15:19.910 --> 01:15:22.920
is going to happen at
six months automatically.

01:15:22.920 --> 01:15:26.090
So if you manipulate it--
so the studies on humans,

01:15:26.090 --> 01:15:27.135
if you send--

01:15:27.135 --> 01:15:28.760
I feel like I said
this in here before,

01:15:28.760 --> 01:15:30.740
but it must have
been somewhere else--

01:15:30.740 --> 01:15:33.830
if you send parents
home with books

01:15:33.830 --> 01:15:37.610
with monkey pictures in them,
parents of six-month-olds,

01:15:37.610 --> 01:15:39.740
and you say, look,
every night, go

01:15:39.740 --> 01:15:42.410
through the book with your kids
and say, there's Monkey Joe,

01:15:42.410 --> 01:15:44.060
and there's Monkey
Bob, and there's

01:15:44.060 --> 01:15:47.870
Monkey Whoever with
your kids, and you

01:15:47.870 --> 01:15:50.240
have them do that from age
six months to 12 months,

01:15:50.240 --> 01:15:52.520
they don't perceptually
narrow, because they continue

01:15:52.520 --> 01:15:55.460
to get that experience, right?

01:15:55.460 --> 01:15:58.580
Interestingly, if the
parents go home and just say,

01:15:58.580 --> 01:16:02.420
look, look, that doesn't do it.

01:16:02.420 --> 01:16:05.090
You have to give them some
social cue that is essentially

01:16:05.090 --> 01:16:07.940
saying, this thing is
different from that thing.

01:16:07.940 --> 01:16:09.560
And if you do that
with an infant,

01:16:09.560 --> 01:16:11.768
even when they don't really
understand language much,

01:16:11.768 --> 01:16:14.065
they get that cue, and they
learn to discriminate--

01:16:14.065 --> 01:16:16.565
or they maintain their ability
to discriminate monkey faces.

01:16:19.520 --> 01:16:20.020
Yeah?

01:16:20.020 --> 01:16:21.562
AUDIENCE: Does that
hold up even when

01:16:21.562 --> 01:16:23.492
they're past the 12 months old?

01:16:23.492 --> 01:16:24.950
NANCY KANWISHER:
Well, I'm guessing

01:16:24.950 --> 01:16:29.090
it will be just like the
case that McKone showed

01:16:29.090 --> 01:16:31.240
with other race effects, right?

01:16:31.240 --> 01:16:32.990
I'm guessing the other
species effect will

01:16:32.990 --> 01:16:35.870
be like the other
race effect in that

01:16:35.870 --> 01:16:38.300
if you, say, start
working in a monkey lab

01:16:38.300 --> 01:16:40.670
when you're eight years old--

01:16:40.670 --> 01:16:43.190
that would be weird,
but you could--

01:16:43.190 --> 01:16:44.960
or you-- I don't know, whatever.

01:16:44.960 --> 01:16:48.410
Anyway, that you would be able
to relearn it on the same time

01:16:48.410 --> 01:16:51.440
scale that you would relearn--

01:16:51.440 --> 01:16:54.800
relearn, or learn for the
first time, previously

01:16:54.800 --> 01:16:56.630
unfamiliar races of faces.

01:16:56.630 --> 01:17:00.270
But maybe those are slightly
different timelines.

01:17:00.270 --> 01:17:01.320
Yeah?

01:17:01.320 --> 01:17:03.120
AUDIENCE: Could you
do something similar

01:17:03.120 --> 01:17:05.370
with the monkey faces,
but with phonemes

01:17:05.370 --> 01:17:06.623
in different languages?

01:17:06.623 --> 01:17:08.040
NANCY KANWISHER:
I'm sure you can,

01:17:08.040 --> 01:17:09.600
and I'm sure that
has been done, but I

01:17:09.600 --> 01:17:10.725
don't know that literature.

01:17:10.725 --> 01:17:11.260
Yeah.

01:17:11.260 --> 01:17:12.630
Yeah, you mean like keep--

01:17:12.630 --> 01:17:13.290
well, OK.

01:17:13.290 --> 01:17:15.480
I mean, it essentially
does get done, right?

01:17:15.480 --> 01:17:20.680
So kids who stay
in environments--

01:17:20.680 --> 01:17:21.750
let me think about this.

01:17:21.750 --> 01:17:24.660
Well, certainly, an
infant who's being

01:17:24.660 --> 01:17:26.460
raised in a
bilingual environment

01:17:26.460 --> 01:17:29.130
will maintain their ability
to discriminate those phonemes

01:17:29.130 --> 01:17:32.348
from any of the languages
they hear, right?

01:17:32.348 --> 01:17:34.890
AUDIENCE: So you're saying, with
the monkeys thing, some kind

01:17:34.890 --> 01:17:37.440
of social cue to know that--

01:17:37.440 --> 01:17:39.240
NANCY KANWISHER: I
suspect that's true.

01:17:39.240 --> 01:17:40.948
I don't know this
literature well enough.

01:17:40.948 --> 01:17:43.317
I do know-- yeah, actually,
it's coming back dimly.

01:17:43.317 --> 01:17:44.400
Heather, do you know this?

01:17:44.400 --> 01:17:45.000
Janet Werker

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:46.740
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:17:46.740 --> 01:17:48.240
NANCY KANWISHER:
OK, so Janet Werker

01:17:48.240 --> 01:17:51.810
is this amazing infant
phoneme perception researcher.

01:17:51.810 --> 01:17:55.650
And I'm pretty sure that
if you present infants

01:17:55.650 --> 01:17:57.630
with just like a TV
in the background

01:17:57.630 --> 01:18:01.200
with a foreign language, even
if the infant doesn't have much

01:18:01.200 --> 01:18:03.270
else to do, that's not enough.

01:18:03.270 --> 01:18:05.580
And you need to look at
them, and engage with them,

01:18:05.580 --> 01:18:09.632
and speak mother-ese-- like,
hey, infant, blah, blah, right?

01:18:09.632 --> 01:18:12.090
I think you need to do all of
that for them to maintain it,

01:18:12.090 --> 01:18:12.668
but I'm--

01:18:12.668 --> 01:18:13.960
AUDIENCE: Yeah, that's correct.

01:18:13.960 --> 01:18:15.668
I think there also
has to be interaction.

01:18:15.668 --> 01:18:18.420
They can't also just be
watching the [INAUDIBLE]..

01:18:18.420 --> 01:18:20.220
It has to be
slightly [INAUDIBLE]

01:18:20.220 --> 01:18:21.340
reciprocal [INAUDIBLE].

01:18:21.340 --> 01:18:23.460
AUDIENCE: And the
fact that [INAUDIBLE]..

01:18:26.108 --> 01:18:27.400
NANCY KANWISHER: Correct, yeah.

01:18:27.400 --> 01:18:29.516
AUDIENCE: So even if it's
not just [INAUDIBLE],,

01:18:29.516 --> 01:18:30.752
it has to be [INAUDIBLE].

01:18:30.752 --> 01:18:32.210
NANCY KANWISHER:
It has to be what?

01:18:32.210 --> 01:18:33.918
AUDIENCE: It has to
be like [INAUDIBLE]..

01:18:33.918 --> 01:18:35.390
It can't be [INAUDIBLE].

01:18:35.390 --> 01:18:38.190
AUDIENCE: Yeah, which makes me
of [INAUDIBLE] or something--

01:18:38.190 --> 01:18:40.490
like if you interact in
different ways, [INAUDIBLE]..

01:18:43.040 --> 01:18:44.430
NANCY KANWISHER: Cool, yeah?

01:18:44.430 --> 01:18:47.270
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I have a
question about how long

01:18:47.270 --> 01:18:49.286
that [INAUDIBLE] lasts.

01:18:49.286 --> 01:18:50.930
If someone spoke
a foreign language

01:18:50.930 --> 01:18:53.220
when they were younger,
then moved somewhere else

01:18:53.220 --> 01:18:56.120
or were adopted and then
stopped speaking the language,

01:18:56.120 --> 01:19:03.420
[INAUDIBLE],, could they
sort of be [INAUDIBLE]??

01:19:03.420 --> 01:19:04.670
NANCY KANWISHER: I don't know.

01:19:04.670 --> 01:19:06.253
I'm sure there's a
literature on that.

01:19:06.253 --> 01:19:07.970
You don't know
that, Dana, do you?

01:19:07.970 --> 01:19:11.090
Sorry, like so you're
raised bilingual,

01:19:11.090 --> 01:19:13.580
and then you stop having
the experience early

01:19:13.580 --> 01:19:16.100
on from your second
language, and then

01:19:16.100 --> 01:19:18.860
you're re-exposed
later at age eight?

01:19:18.860 --> 01:19:19.850
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:19:19.850 --> 01:19:21.640
AUDIENCE: Yeah, you
still have the--

01:19:21.640 --> 01:19:23.140
yeah, you maintain
the [INAUDIBLE]..

01:19:23.140 --> 01:19:24.100
AUDIENCE: Yeah, like after--

01:19:24.100 --> 01:19:25.475
NANCY KANWISHER:
Well, but wait--

01:19:25.475 --> 01:19:27.935
AUDIENCE: But you're not able
to speak the language, right?

01:19:27.935 --> 01:19:28.560
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:19:28.560 --> 01:19:29.840
AUDIENCE: But you
still [INAUDIBLE]..

01:19:29.840 --> 01:19:30.290
AUDIENCE: But I guess you--

01:19:30.290 --> 01:19:31.665
NANCY KANWISHER:
But then, that's

01:19:31.665 --> 01:19:33.565
not consistent with
perceptual narrowing.

01:19:33.565 --> 01:19:35.690
AUDIENCE: If you're exposed
to it before two years?

01:19:35.690 --> 01:19:36.170
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:19:36.170 --> 01:19:36.260
NANCY KANWISHER: Yeah.

01:19:36.260 --> 01:19:37.635
AUDIENCE: And then
you move away?

01:19:37.635 --> 01:19:39.010
NANCY KANWISHER:
Well, if it goes

01:19:39.010 --> 01:19:40.880
beyond that six-month
thing, yeah, OK.

01:19:40.880 --> 01:19:42.620
AUDIENCE: I think
that's the case, yeah.

01:19:42.620 --> 01:19:44.287
You might not have
the higher structure,

01:19:44.287 --> 01:19:48.170
but if you like you the
syntax and some vocabulary,

01:19:48.170 --> 01:19:51.170
you'll have a better accent
than someone who did not

01:19:51.170 --> 01:19:53.090
have that early
experience, might not

01:19:53.090 --> 01:19:55.990
be able to differentiate
[INAUDIBLE]..

01:19:55.990 --> 01:19:56.650
But--

01:19:56.650 --> 01:19:57.942
AUDIENCE: You just [INAUDIBLE].

01:20:00.460 --> 01:20:02.937
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE],,
I think that's correct.

01:20:02.937 --> 01:20:04.020
NANCY KANWISHER: OK, good.

01:20:04.020 --> 01:20:04.770
One more question.

01:20:04.770 --> 01:20:05.440
Josh?

01:20:05.440 --> 01:20:07.023
AUDIENCE: So do we
know of cases where

01:20:07.023 --> 01:20:12.000
there's [INAUDIBLE] a mismatch
between [INAUDIBLE] sort

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:13.300
of information?

01:20:13.300 --> 01:20:13.800
Like--

01:20:13.800 --> 01:20:14.460
NANCY KANWISHER: Like this?

01:20:14.460 --> 01:20:16.350
AUDIENCE: Yeah, like--
with this property

01:20:16.350 --> 01:20:18.720
in some of the domain of
some of the [INAUDIBLE]..

01:20:18.720 --> 01:20:20.495
Basically be [INAUDIBLE].

01:20:20.495 --> 01:20:21.870
NANCY KANWISHER:
Oh, god, I don't

01:20:21.870 --> 01:20:25.290
have my dictionary of
knowledge filed that way

01:20:25.290 --> 01:20:27.090
so I can pull up an
instance of that,

01:20:27.090 --> 01:20:29.115
but I'm sure there
are loads of those.

01:20:29.115 --> 01:20:30.153
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:20:30.153 --> 01:20:32.070
NANCY KANWISHER: Yeah,
well, because when we--

01:20:32.070 --> 01:20:34.320
because we're making all
these assumptions about which

01:20:34.320 --> 01:20:37.108
behavioral ability is subserved
by some particular activation

01:20:37.108 --> 01:20:37.650
in the brain.

01:20:37.650 --> 01:20:40.238
And mostly, we
don't know, right?

01:20:40.238 --> 01:20:42.030
We know when we have
the rare opportunities

01:20:42.030 --> 01:20:42.990
to do causal tests.

01:20:42.990 --> 01:20:44.850
We have a better
idea that that system

01:20:44.850 --> 01:20:48.750
is at least causally involved
in that behavioral ability.

01:20:48.750 --> 01:20:53.890
But yeah, often, those links
are much looser than we'd like.

01:20:53.890 --> 01:20:56.550
All right, see you
guys Wednesday.

00:00:31.874 --> 00:00:33.370
HERBERT GROSS: Hi.

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.230
Last time, you
may recall that we

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.810
were looking at
some of our examples

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:39.850
in three-dimensional
space and talking

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:41.770
about picking a
couple of vectors

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.600
in three-dimensional space, be
they i and j or alpha and beta.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.370
And we then talked
about the subspaces

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:53.590
spanned by alpha and beta or
the subspace span by i and j,

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:56.260
noticing that the
subspace could be smaller

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:57.520
than the entire space.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.130
Or possibly, it could even
equal the entire space.

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:02.950
In no event could it be
greater than the entire space.

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:05.560
At any rate, what we
would like to do today

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.880
is to generalize this
idea into more than two

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.110
or three dimensions.

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.950
And also, to make
the generalization

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.052
go independently of
our n-tuple notation

00:01:18.052 --> 00:01:19.510
that we used earlier
in the course.

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:22.570
At any rate, today's
lesson is entitled,

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.610
Spanning Vectors,
and the idea is this.

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.300
Let's suppose we have
a vector space, v,

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:33.440
and we now arbitrarily choose n
vectors, alpha 1 up to alpha n

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.650
and v. For example,
in the lecture

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:40.150
last time, some of our
examples involved v

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.590
being three-dimensional
space and n being two.

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.600
In other words, we picked
i and j, alpha and beta,

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.280
in three-dimensional space.

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.270
But at any rate,
what we do is this.

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.160
We take alpha 1 up to alpha
n, any n arbitrarily chosen,

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:58.210
vectors, n, v, and we look
at the set, which I write

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.090
s of alpha 1 up to alpha n.

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.510
We look at the set of all
linear combinations of alpha 1

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:05.740
up to alpha n.

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.139
And written compactly,
that's written this way.

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:11.200
In other words, it's a c1 alpha
1 plus, et cetera, cn alpha n.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.380
Where the cs are real
numbers, they belong to r.

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.610
Now, my claim is that this
set is more than a set.

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.530
It's a space.

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.830
Namely, if you of two linear
combinations of alpha 1

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.130
up to alpha n, you get a
linear combination of alpha 1

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:28.780
up to alpha n.

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.260
If you take a scalar multiple of
a linear combination of alpha 1

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.860
up to alpha n, you, again, get
a linear combination of alpha 1

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:36.940
up to alpha n.

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.920
Algebraically, this
is quite simple,

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.020
because structurally
we mimic what's

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:42.975
happening in ordinary algebra.

00:02:42.975 --> 00:02:44.350
And what we're
saying is, you can

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:46.780
add the two alpha 1
components together,

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.210
the alpha 2 components
together, et cetera.

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:52.940
I'll illustrate that in a
simple example in a moment,

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.790
but the idea is this.

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.592
What we say is, by definition--

00:02:57.592 --> 00:02:59.800
and we've done this in some
of the exercises already,

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.090
you'll recall--

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.720
that the subspace consisting
of all linear combinations

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.990
of alpha 1 up to alpha n,
which is a subspace of v,

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:11.830
it's called the space spanned
by alpha 1 up to alpha n.

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:13.240
That's all this thing means.

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:15.850
The space spanned by
alpha 1 up to alpha n

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.550
means the set of all linear
combinations of alpha 1

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:21.670
up to alpha n, and that
is a subspace of v.

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.950
For example, the easiest
case I can think of

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.450
is to pick n equals 1, given
a vector space, v, simply pick

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:32.080
any elements, say alpha
1, that belongs to v.

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.590
And all linear combinations
of alpha 1 are simply what?

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.480
All scalar multiples of alpha 1.

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.440
In other words, the
space spanned by alpha 1

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.330
is just a set of all
constant multiples of alpha.

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:46.970
So c alpha 1, where
c is a real number.

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:51.340
Now, my claim is that, clearly,
the sum of any two scalar

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.520
multiples of alpha 1 is a
scalar multiple of alpha 1.

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:57.100
And a scalar multiple of a
scalar multiple of alpha 1

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.320
is, again, a scalar
multiple of alpha 1.

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.360
I'd like to show you that,
though, independently

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.190
of a geometric interpretation.

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:06.230
This follows clearly from
our axiomatic approach,

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.770
namely, suppose
beta and gamma are

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:12.490
any two elements in the
space spanned by alpha 1.

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:15.160
That means beta is a
scalar multiple as alpha 1,

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:16.720
say c1 alpha 1.

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:21.040
Gamma is a scalar multiple
of alpha 1, say c2 alpha 1.

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:26.260
Therefore, beta plus gamma is
c1 alpha 1 plus c2 alpha 1.

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.210
By our distributive
property, that's

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:30.910
c1 plus c2 times alpha 1.

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:33.490
But since c1 and
c2 a real numbers,

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:36.190
and the sum of two real numbers
is, again, a real number,

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:39.070
we see that beta plus
gamma is a real number

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:42.160
times alpha 1, in other words,
a scalar multiple of alpha 1.

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.170
And that means that
by definition it

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:46.840
belongs to the space
spanned by alpha 1.

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:50.350
Similarly, if we take beta and
multiply it by the real number

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:55.930
r, r times c1 alpha 1, by
the associated property

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:59.230
for scalar multiplication,
is the scale of multiple r

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:01.880
times c1 times alpha 1.

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:04.880
And if r and c1 are real
number, so is their product.

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:09.550
So consequently, r times beta
is a scalar times alpha 1,

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:11.800
which by definition means
it's in the space spanned

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:13.090
by alpha 1.

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:16.210
And geometrically, if you want
to see what this thing means,

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:18.520
notice that the space
spanned by alpha 1--

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:21.190
if you want think of
alpha 1 as an arrow--

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:24.780
the space spanned by
alpha 1 is simply what?

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:27.100
The set of all linear
combinations of alpha--

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:31.120
all scalar multiples of alpha
1, and that is precisely

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.863
the straight line
determined by alpha 1.

00:05:33.863 --> 00:05:35.530
In other words, any
linear combination--

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:38.260
any scalar multiple
of alpha 1 has what?

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.938
The same direction as alpha 1.

00:05:40.938 --> 00:05:42.730
In other words, lies
in the same direction,

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:44.950
but may have a
different magnitude

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:46.450
and/or a different sense.

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:50.330
But certainly, the line
part doesn't change.

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:52.240
Now, the key point
is this, and this

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:55.150
is going to play a very key
role throughout the remainder

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:56.890
of our discussion.

00:05:56.890 --> 00:06:00.310
One would believe
that the more vectors

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:03.940
you take linear combinations of,
the bigger your space becomes.

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:05.980
In other words, if you
take the space spanned

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:09.130
by two vectors, then tack
onto those two vectors

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:11.080
a third vector,
you might believe

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:16.030
that the resulting space must be
larger than the original space.

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:18.183
Well, obviously, it
can't be any smaller,

00:06:18.183 --> 00:06:20.350
and I'll explain what
obviously means in the moment,

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:21.890
if it's not that obvious.

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:25.780
But the key point is, that
if I take not just alpha

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:27.820
1 up to alpha n, but
an additional vector,

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:31.510
say, alpha 1 up to alpha n plus
the additional vector alpha

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:34.960
n plus 1, and look at the
space spanned by alpha 1

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:38.260
through alpha n plus
1, that space need not

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:42.070
be larger than the space spanned
by alpha 1 up to alpha n.

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:45.250
In other words, merely by
tacking on a new vector,

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:47.740
you do not necessarily
tack on to the space

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:49.180
spanned by the vectors.

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:53.470
By means of a trivial example,
let alpha 1 be i, let alpha 2

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:56.620
be j, an alpha 3 be i plus j.

00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:59.770
Clearly, the space spanned
by alpha 1 and alpha 2

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:02.230
is by definition this sort
of all linear combinations

00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:03.760
of alpha 1 alpha 2.

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:05.650
And in terms of this
simple example, that

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:09.340
obviously is the x, y plane,
because alpha 1 is i, alpha 2

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:10.420
as j.

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:13.390
Now, let's look at the space
spanned by alpha 1, alpha 2,

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:14.590
and alpha 3.

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:19.090
Again, geometrically, notice
that that space is still

00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:20.110
the x, y plane.

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:23.650
Because after all, alpha
1, alpha 2, and alpha 3,

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:27.190
being i, j, and i plus
j, respectively, all

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:28.840
lie in the x, y plane.

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:30.940
Consequently, any linear
combination of them

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:32.560
will lie in the x, y plane.

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:34.660
But let's pretend
we didn't know that.

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:37.840
Let's, first of all, observe
that from the pure mathematics

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:41.830
of this alone, that the space
spanned by alpha 1 alpha 2

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:45.280
must be a subspace of the space
spanned by alpha 1, alpha 2,

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:46.360
an alpha 3.

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:48.580
And the proof, by the
way, is quite trivial.

00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:50.980
Namely, by definition,
the space spanned

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:53.620
by alpha 1, alpha
2, alpha 3 is a set

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:57.130
of all linear combinations
of alpha 1, alpha 2, alpha 3.

00:07:57.130 --> 00:08:00.730
In particular, if I
choose c3 to equal 0,

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:03.040
notice that this term drops out.

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:04.900
And in particular,
what I'm left with

00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:07.760
is c1 alpha 1 plus c2 alpha 2.

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:11.380
In other words, every linear
combination of alpha 1

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:15.940
and alpha 2 is, in particular,
a linear combination of alpha 1,

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:19.090
alpha 2, and alpha 3.

00:08:19.090 --> 00:08:21.470
But my claim is, just as
we saw geometrically--

00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:23.540
let me now prove
this algebraically--

00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:28.210
that in particular, if beta
is any vector belonging

00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:31.510
to the space spanned by alpha
1, alpha 2, and alpha 3,

00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:35.139
axiomatically, it must belong
to the space spanned by alpha 1

00:08:35.139 --> 00:08:36.220
and alpha 2.

00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:37.330
We see that geometrically.

00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:40.390
We already know that the
space is still the x, y plane.

00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:42.340
How would we prove
this axiomatically?

00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:45.690
Well, if beta belongs to
this space, by definition

00:08:45.690 --> 00:08:49.420
it's a linear combination as
alpha 1, alpha 2, alpha 3.

00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:52.810
Noticing, that alpha 3
is by definition alpha 1

00:08:52.810 --> 00:08:54.130
plus alpha 2.

00:08:54.130 --> 00:08:57.520
I can replace alpha 3
by alpha 1 plus alpha 2.

00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:00.880
I can now distribute c3
with alpha 1 and alpha 2.

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:04.120
I can now combine the alpha
1 terms and the alpha 2 terms

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:04.650
together.

00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:12.430
In other words, c1 plus c3
alpha 1 plus c2 plus c3 alpha 2.

00:09:12.430 --> 00:09:14.890
Notice, that since
c1, c2, and c3

00:09:14.890 --> 00:09:19.450
are real numbers, c1 plus c3
is the real number. c2 plus c3

00:09:19.450 --> 00:09:20.500
is a real number.

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:23.785
Consequently, beta is a
linear combination of alpha 1

00:09:23.785 --> 00:09:24.910
and alpha 2.

00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:28.700
Therefore, beta is in the space
spanned by alpha 1 and alpha 2.

00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:32.740
Therefore, the space spanned by
alpha 1, alpha 2, and alpha 3

00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:36.580
is a subspace of the space
spanned by alpha 1 and alpha 2.

00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:39.580
And since each of the subspaces
is a subspace of the other,

00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:41.770
we see that these
two spaces happen

00:09:41.770 --> 00:09:43.545
to be equal in this sense.

00:09:43.545 --> 00:09:44.920
And by the way,
if you're looking

00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:48.340
for a very quick way of seeing
how this transcends such

00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:50.740
a simple application,
notice that when

00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:53.830
we were dealing with
differential equations,

00:09:53.830 --> 00:09:57.280
we looked for solutions that
were linearly independent.

00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:59.440
In other words, we
wanted solutions

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:02.980
that could not be expressed
as linear combinations

00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:04.660
of the previous solutions.

00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:06.160
And the reason for
that was, if they

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:09.370
could be expressed this
way, the arbitrary constants

00:10:09.370 --> 00:10:13.060
weren't independent in the sense
that they could be amalgamated.

00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:17.110
At any rate, whichever
interpretation you want here,

00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:20.650
notice that this leads to
a generalized definition.

00:10:20.650 --> 00:10:25.180
Namely, given the n vectors,
alpha 1 up to alpha n and v,

00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:28.210
they are called
linearly dependent.

00:10:28.210 --> 00:10:29.980
Now, this may look
like a messy expression

00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:31.180
that might frighten you.

00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:35.700
All this says is they're called
linearly dependent if one

00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:39.660
of the vectors can be written
as a linear combination

00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:40.740
of the others.

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:43.170
And by the way, without
proving it here, but leaving

00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:48.060
that for the exercises, it
can be shown that not only

00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:50.730
when this can be done,
but when it can be done,

00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:53.790
the vector can be written
as a linear combination

00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:55.870
of the vectors that came before.

00:10:55.870 --> 00:10:57.540
In other words, if
any vector, when you

00:10:57.540 --> 00:11:00.930
list these in any order, if any
one of the vectors in the given

00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:06.150
order can be expressed in
terms of a linear combination

00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:08.630
of the preceding
ones, then the set

00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:11.340
is called linearly dependent.

00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:13.200
If this can't
happen, then they are

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:15.240
called linearly independent.

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:17.400
Now, the reason I give this
definition first-- it's

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:19.290
a bad definition,
because it seems

00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:21.780
to depend on the order in
which I list the vectors.

00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:23.640
The reason I give
this definition first

00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:25.530
is because, I think,
intuitively, it's

00:11:25.530 --> 00:11:26.640
easier to see.

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:28.950
In a moment, I will give
you a different definition

00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:30.270
that's equivalent to this one.

00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:33.540
But first, let me exploit this
fairly intuitive definition.

00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:36.630
By means of an
example, suppose I'm

00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:42.990
given the four vectors, i plus
j, i minus j, 5i plus j, and i

00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:45.420
plus j plus k.

00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:47.400
My claim is that
these four vectors

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:50.670
form a linearly-dependent
set, because, in particular,

00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:54.150
in the given order,
5i plus j can

00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:57.600
be expressed as a linear
combination of i plus j and i

00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:59.190
minus j.

00:11:59.190 --> 00:12:03.870
Namely, 5i plus j is three
times the first vector here, i

00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:07.560
plus j, plus 2 times the
second vector, i minus j.

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:09.660
By the way, in the
next lecture, we'll

00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:12.700
show how you pick off these
coefficients very quickly,

00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:14.430
but we'll let that
go until next time.

00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:16.290
For now, all that's
important is notice

00:12:16.290 --> 00:12:19.213
that this vector is a linear
combination of these two.

00:12:19.213 --> 00:12:20.880
Notice, by the way,
you could have said,

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:24.890
but couldn't you express i minus
j as a linear combination of i

00:12:24.890 --> 00:12:27.420
plus j and 5i plus j?

00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:28.410
The answer is, yes.

00:12:28.410 --> 00:12:33.510
In other words, if I had written
the 5i plus j and the i minus j

00:12:33.510 --> 00:12:35.790
in an interchanged
order, notice that it

00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:37.830
would be i minus
j that would have

00:12:37.830 --> 00:12:41.710
been a linear combination
of i plus j and 5i plus j.

00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:46.650
That's why this is kind
of a hazy definition.

00:12:46.650 --> 00:12:50.100
It seems to depend on the
order in which the vectors are

00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:50.910
written.

00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:54.210
A more conventional
definition is the following.

00:12:54.210 --> 00:12:57.210
And just to show you that
dependence and independence are

00:12:57.210 --> 00:13:00.600
themselves independent, meaning
you can start with either one,

00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:02.640
let me give you an
equivalent definition,

00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:06.110
but now stressing linear
independence instead.

00:13:06.110 --> 00:13:10.170
Namely, notice that, if I
pick all 0 coefficients,

00:13:10.170 --> 00:13:14.040
in other words, 0 alpha 1 plus
a set with 0 alpha n, obviously,

00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:18.130
that linear combination
will add up to 0.

00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:20.890
If that's the only way you can
make a linear combination add

00:13:20.890 --> 00:13:22.990
up to 0, then the
vectors are said

00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:24.820
to be linearly independent.

00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:27.310
In other words,
alpha 1 up to alpha n

00:13:27.310 --> 00:13:31.030
are called linearly
independent if the only way

00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:33.880
that a linear combination
of them can equal 0

00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:36.950
is if every coefficient is 0.

00:13:36.950 --> 00:13:39.970
Again, keep in mind that
the converse is trivial.

00:13:39.970 --> 00:13:43.930
If every coefficient is 0,
then, obviously, this will be 0.

00:13:43.930 --> 00:13:46.870
For linearly-independent
vectors what we're saying is,

00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:51.400
the only way this can be 0 is
if all the coefficients are 0.

00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:54.200
And again, to emphasize
linear dependence,

00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:55.740
what that would mean is what?

00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:58.270
That the vectors would
be linearly dependent

00:13:58.270 --> 00:14:00.400
if you could find a
linear combination,

00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:04.680
c1 alpha 1 plus, et cetera,
cn alpha n equal to 0,

00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:08.230
where at least one of the
cs was not equal to 0.

00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:10.780
Now, I'm going to stress
that in the exercises.

00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:14.500
This stuff is so new to
many of you, I believe,

00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:17.680
that it's very, very difficult
to teach it in great depth

00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:18.730
during a lecture.

00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:22.630
I think it has to be kept on
a fairly superficial level,

00:14:22.630 --> 00:14:25.360
leaving additional
details to the exercises.

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:28.060
Rather than hammer home
these exercises now,

00:14:28.060 --> 00:14:31.330
let's simply point out
that linear dependence

00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:33.070
implies redundancy.

00:14:33.070 --> 00:14:35.080
In other words, if
one of the vectors

00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:38.470
can be expressed as linear
combination of the others,

00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:42.310
it can be deleted when you're
talking about a set of spanning

00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:43.180
vectors.

00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:45.190
In other words, going
back to our example

00:14:45.190 --> 00:14:48.250
of the space spanned by
alpha 1 up to alpha n,

00:14:48.250 --> 00:14:51.010
there are no redundancies
if the alphas

00:14:51.010 --> 00:14:53.350
happen to be independent.

00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:55.330
But if they're
dependent, it means

00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:57.640
that any vector which
can be expressed

00:14:57.640 --> 00:14:59.950
as a linear combination
of the others

00:14:59.950 --> 00:15:03.580
can be deleted without
losing anything in the space.

00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:06.353
And I'll show you that in
terms of other examples later.

00:15:06.353 --> 00:15:08.770
But let me show what that means
from another point of view

00:15:08.770 --> 00:15:11.750
also that I want to bring
out later in the lecture,

00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:13.480
and that is another key point.

00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:17.140
That if the alphas happen to
be linearly independent, then

00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:20.560
if beta belongs to the
space spanned by the alphas,

00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:24.100
not only can beta be written
as a linear combination

00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:26.680
of the alphas, but
it can be done so

00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:29.620
in one and only one way.

00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:32.980
In other words, to say
this in a different form,

00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:36.910
if the alphas are linearly
independent, if beta belongs

00:15:36.910 --> 00:15:39.550
to the space spanned
by the alphas,

00:15:39.550 --> 00:15:43.990
it has a unique representation
as a linear combination

00:15:43.990 --> 00:15:45.220
of the alphas.

00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:47.380
And what that means from
another point of view

00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:50.140
is, that if the alphas
are linearly independent,

00:15:50.140 --> 00:15:53.590
the only way that two linear
combinations can be equal

00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:56.770
is if they are equal
coefficient by coefficient.

00:15:56.770 --> 00:15:59.560
By the way, that was a
technique that we used

00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:01.220
in undetermined coefficients.

00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:03.340
And again, that shows
you why functions,

00:16:03.340 --> 00:16:06.220
like the exponential, sine,
and cosine, et cetera,

00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:09.340
tie-in with this generalized
definition of a vector space.

00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:11.440
That all of these
things have applications

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:15.550
far beyond any interpretation
due to arrows alone.

00:16:15.550 --> 00:16:17.170
But the proof of
something like this,

00:16:17.170 --> 00:16:19.810
given that these two linear
combinations are equal,

00:16:19.810 --> 00:16:22.940
simply transpose and
collect like terms,

00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:25.480
which we can do
algebraically by the axioms

00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:27.220
that we're permitted
to work with here.

00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:30.520
If we group these
terms, we get this.

00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:32.680
Since the alphas are
linearly independent,

00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:35.410
the only way a linear
combination can be 0

00:16:35.410 --> 00:16:37.570
is if each of the
coefficients is 0.

00:16:37.570 --> 00:16:40.090
That means, in particular,
that a1 minus b1

00:16:40.090 --> 00:16:44.140
must be 0, et cetera, up
to an minus bn being 0.

00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:45.730
And that says, in
addition, what?

00:16:45.730 --> 00:16:49.630
That a1 must equal b1,
et cetera, an equals bn,

00:16:49.630 --> 00:16:52.330
and that verifies the claim,
that if the alphas are

00:16:52.330 --> 00:16:54.640
independent,
linearly independent,

00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:57.880
then two different
sets of coefficients

00:16:57.880 --> 00:17:00.430
must lead to two
different vectors.

00:17:00.430 --> 00:17:03.070
In terms of example
two, you see, notice

00:17:03.070 --> 00:17:07.839
that alpha 3 was a linear
combination of alpha 1

00:17:07.839 --> 00:17:08.410
and alpha 2.

00:17:08.410 --> 00:17:11.490
Remember, alpha 3 was
alpha 1 plus alpha 2.

00:17:11.490 --> 00:17:15.099
Notice that, therefore,
I can express alpha 3

00:17:15.099 --> 00:17:18.400
in more than one way as a
linear combination of alpha 1,

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:19.750
alpha 2, and alpha 3.

00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:24.010
For example, certainly alpha
3 is 0 alpha 1 plus 0 alpha 2

00:17:24.010 --> 00:17:25.569
plus 1 alpha 3.

00:17:25.569 --> 00:17:26.890
That's just alpha 3.

00:17:26.890 --> 00:17:29.170
On the other hand, since
alpha 1 plus alpha 2

00:17:29.170 --> 00:17:32.800
is alpha 3, and 1 alpha 1
is alpha 1 and 1 alpha 2

00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:35.650
is alpha 2, notice
that alpha 3 can also

00:17:35.650 --> 00:17:40.120
be written as 1 alpha 1 plus
1 alpha 2 plus 0 alpha 3.

00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:43.160
See, the alphas were linearly
dependent in this example.

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:45.880
Notice that this allows
me to express alpha 3

00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:49.150
as two different linear
combinations of alpha 1,

00:17:49.150 --> 00:17:51.550
alpha 2, and alpha 3.

00:17:51.550 --> 00:17:53.670
By the way, it's
not just these two.

00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:56.470
There are instantly many
different ways I can do this.

00:17:56.470 --> 00:17:59.950
Namely, since alpha 3
is alpha 1 plus alpha 2,

00:17:59.950 --> 00:18:02.260
pick c to be an
arbitrary constant,

00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:06.580
and look at the expression c
alpha 1 plus c alpha 2 times

00:18:06.580 --> 00:18:08.770
1 minus c alpha 3.

00:18:08.770 --> 00:18:13.210
If I expand this, this becomes
c alpha 1 plus c alpha 2

00:18:13.210 --> 00:18:14.560
minus c alpha 3.

00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:17.100
That's minus c alpha
1 plus alpha 2.

00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:20.280
That cancels, and all
I have left is alpha 3.

00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:23.250
In other words, alpha 3 can be
written in infinitely many ways

00:18:23.250 --> 00:18:26.610
as a linear combination of
alpha 1, alpha 2, and alpha 3,

00:18:26.610 --> 00:18:29.070
because the alphas were
linearly dependent.

00:18:29.070 --> 00:18:31.080
At any rate, again,
let me emphasize,

00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:33.150
I'll drill on this
with the exercises.

00:18:33.150 --> 00:18:36.360
What I'd like to do now
is revisit the concept

00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:38.880
of dimension, which
we treated in terms

00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:42.030
of n-tuples in terms
of spanning vectors

00:18:42.030 --> 00:18:44.220
and linear independence.

00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:47.250
Namely, let's suppose I
have any vector space now,

00:18:47.250 --> 00:18:50.850
not necessarily one written
in terms of n-tuples.

00:18:50.850 --> 00:18:53.473
Let's suppose that this other
vectors and the 0 vector

00:18:53.473 --> 00:18:55.140
in the vector space,
because, after all,

00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:58.500
if the only vector in the
vector space is the 0 vector,

00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:00.687
it's not a very
exciting vector space.

00:19:00.687 --> 00:19:02.520
So let me assume that
I have something other

00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:04.020
than a 0 vector in here.

00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:08.790
Let me pick any non-zero vector
in v. Let me call it alpha 1.

00:19:08.790 --> 00:19:11.940
And I now-- look at the
space-- span by alpha 1.

00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:15.300
Clearly, that's a subspace of v.

00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:16.860
On the other hand--

00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:18.160
or not on the other hand.

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:20.280
Well, on the other
hand, this might

00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:25.590
be all of v. If the space
spanned by alpha 1 is all of v,

00:19:25.590 --> 00:19:29.280
we stop at that point and
say, v is one-dimensional,

00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:33.390
and it's spanned by the
single vector, alpha 1.

00:19:33.390 --> 00:19:36.870
On the other hand, suppose s,
the space spanned by alpha 1,

00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:40.210
it's not all of v. Well,
what does that mean?

00:19:40.210 --> 00:19:42.160
It means there must
be a vector, say alpha

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:45.540
2, which belongs to v, but
not to the space spanned

00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:47.100
by alpha 1.

00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:52.830
Well, what we do now is
augment alpha 1 by alpha 2.

00:19:52.830 --> 00:19:56.850
And we now look at the space
spanned by alpha 1 and alpha 2.

00:19:56.850 --> 00:20:00.750
The first thing I claim is that
the space spanned by alpha 1

00:20:00.750 --> 00:20:06.680
and alpha 2 is a proper
superspace of the space spanned

00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:07.490
by alpha 1.

00:20:07.490 --> 00:20:09.950
In other words, it's a
space spanned by alpha 1.

00:20:09.950 --> 00:20:12.920
It's contained in but not equal
to the space spanned by alpha 1

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:14.030
and alpha 2.

00:20:14.030 --> 00:20:15.230
Why is this?

00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:18.260
Well, for one thing,
alpha 2 by definition

00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:21.530
didn't belong to the
space spanned by alpha 1.

00:20:21.530 --> 00:20:23.870
See, we picked alpha 2 not
to be in the space spanned

00:20:23.870 --> 00:20:25.010
by alpha 1.

00:20:25.010 --> 00:20:27.920
On the other hand, alpha 2 does
belong to the space spanned

00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:30.490
by alpha 1 and alpha 2.

00:20:30.490 --> 00:20:34.010
You see, notice that the space
spanned by alpha 1 and alpha 2

00:20:34.010 --> 00:20:37.060
consists of all linear
combinations of alpha 1

00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:39.770
and alpha 2, and in
particular, alpha 2

00:20:39.770 --> 00:20:42.430
can be written as 0
alpha 1 plus 1 alpha

00:20:42.430 --> 00:20:45.035
2, which makes it a linear
combination of alpha 1

00:20:45.035 --> 00:20:46.010
and alpha 2.

00:20:46.010 --> 00:20:49.340
So alpha 2 does not belong to
the space spanned by alpha 1,

00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:54.470
but it does belong to the space
spanned by alpha 1 and alpha 2.

00:20:54.470 --> 00:20:58.280
Notice, therefore, that we
have now enlarged our space.

00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:02.750
Notice also that alpha 1 alpha
2 must be linearly independent.

00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:05.540
In other words, we
chose any alpha 2,

00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:08.730
provided only that it belonged
to v but not to the space

00:21:08.730 --> 00:21:10.340
spanned by alpha 1.

00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:13.190
But that alpha 2, no
matter how we choose it,

00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:15.980
must be linearly
independent of alpha 1,

00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:18.650
because, after all, if they
were linearly dependent,

00:21:18.650 --> 00:21:22.070
that would mean that alpha 2 is
a scalar multiple as alpha 1.

00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:25.005
But that's a contradiction,
because if alpha 2 were

00:21:25.005 --> 00:21:27.680
a scalar multiple of
alpha 1, by definition

00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:30.470
it would belong to the
space spanned by alpha 1.

00:21:30.470 --> 00:21:34.100
But we specifically chose it
not to belong to that space.

00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:36.560
At any rate, we
continue on in this way.

00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:40.580
Namely, the space spanned
by alpha 1 and alpha 2

00:21:40.580 --> 00:21:43.130
might be all of v,
in which case we then

00:21:43.130 --> 00:21:47.000
say v is two-dimensional and
that it's spanned by alpha 1

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:48.170
and alpha 2.

00:21:48.170 --> 00:21:52.100
Or it may be that the space
spanned by alpha 1 and alpha 2

00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:55.700
is a proper subset of v and
doesn't give me all of v.

00:21:55.700 --> 00:21:58.520
In this event, I
now pick an alpha 3,

00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:02.120
which belongs to v, but not to
the space spanned by alpha 1

00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:04.070
and alpha 2.

00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:07.370
Again, notice that alpha
1, alpha 2, and alpha 3

00:22:07.370 --> 00:22:10.970
must be linearly independent
since if alpha 3 could

00:22:10.970 --> 00:22:12.440
be expressed as a linear--

00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:14.420
see, we know alpha
2 can't be expressed

00:22:14.420 --> 00:22:16.580
as a linear
combination of alpha 1,

00:22:16.580 --> 00:22:20.030
because alpha 2 was linearly
independent of alpha 1.

00:22:20.030 --> 00:22:21.560
Now we tack on alpha 3.

00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:24.860
The only possibility is is
alpha 3 a linear combination

00:22:24.860 --> 00:22:26.570
of alpha 1 and alpha 2?

00:22:26.570 --> 00:22:28.400
And the answer is,
it couldn't be.

00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:31.370
Because if alpha 3 were a
linear combination of alpha 1

00:22:31.370 --> 00:22:34.040
and alpha 2, by
definition it would

00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:37.760
belong to the space spanned
by alpha 1 and alpha 2.

00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:42.050
But by construction, alpha 3 was
chosen not to be in that space.

00:22:42.050 --> 00:22:44.630
Consequently, if alpha
3 were in that space,

00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:46.760
that would obviously
be a contradiction.

00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:50.180
In other words, alpha 3
cannot be a linear combination

00:22:50.180 --> 00:22:51.650
of alpha 1 and alpha 2.

00:22:51.650 --> 00:22:54.710
Therefore, these three vectors
are linearly independent.

00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:57.550
And similarly, alpha 3,
not belonging to the space

00:22:57.550 --> 00:23:01.010
spanned by alpha 1 and
alpha 2, enlarges the space

00:23:01.010 --> 00:23:03.350
spanned by alpha 1 and alpha 2.

00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:05.750
In terms of a
rough picture here,

00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:08.930
what we're saying is, we start
with some vector, alpha 1.

00:23:08.930 --> 00:23:11.600
s of alpha 1 is some subspace.

00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:14.660
We put an alpha 2, which doesn't
belong to the space spanned

00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:16.250
by alpha 1.

00:23:16.250 --> 00:23:19.100
Then the space spanned
by alpha 1 and alpha 2

00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:22.280
is this larger
subspace, which contains

00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:24.590
the space spanned by alpha 1.

00:23:24.590 --> 00:23:28.850
If that isn't all of v, we
pick a third vector, alpha 3,

00:23:28.850 --> 00:23:32.150
which isn't in the space
spanned by alpha 1 and alpha 2.

00:23:32.150 --> 00:23:35.030
And we then form the space
spanned by alpha 1, alpha 2,

00:23:35.030 --> 00:23:38.885
and alpha 3, which will contain
the space spanned by alpha 1

00:23:38.885 --> 00:23:41.000
and alpha 2 as a subspace.

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:45.890
And to make a long story short,
we simply continue in this way

00:23:45.890 --> 00:23:50.482
until we find alpha
1, say, up to alpha n.

00:23:50.482 --> 00:23:53.480
In other words, we continue
for n steps this way,

00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:57.470
such that v will eventually be
the space spanned by alpha 1

00:23:57.470 --> 00:23:58.680
up to alpha n.

00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:01.260
And let me emphasize that
this need not happen.

00:24:01.260 --> 00:24:05.210
In other words, v might be
such a huge vector space,

00:24:05.210 --> 00:24:08.840
that continuing in this way,
we could go on forever and not

00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:10.940
exhaust all of v this way.

00:24:10.940 --> 00:24:12.890
But suppose, for the
sake of argument,

00:24:12.890 --> 00:24:16.250
that this does happen,
that we find n alphas such

00:24:16.250 --> 00:24:21.410
that v is spanned by
alpha 1 up to alpha n,

00:24:21.410 --> 00:24:23.330
where the alphas
are constructed,

00:24:23.330 --> 00:24:25.650
as I've indicated previously.

00:24:25.650 --> 00:24:31.040
In this case, we say that v has
dimension n written this way,

00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:33.860
and the set of vectors,
alpha 1 up to alpha n,

00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:36.970
is called a basis
for v. And the reason

00:24:36.970 --> 00:24:39.860
that it's called the basis
for v is that not only can

00:24:39.860 --> 00:24:42.800
every vector be written
as a linear combination

00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:45.080
of the alphas, every
vector in v written

00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:47.270
as a linear combination
of the alphas,

00:24:47.270 --> 00:24:49.850
but it has a unique
representation

00:24:49.850 --> 00:24:52.460
in terms of the alphas,
because the alphas were

00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:53.630
linearly independent.

00:24:53.630 --> 00:24:58.460
In other words, once you have a
basis, you see, any vector in v

00:24:58.460 --> 00:25:02.000
can be written uniquely
as an n-tuple where

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:06.240
the coefficients stand for
the coefficients of alpha 1

00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:07.950
up to alpha n.

00:25:07.950 --> 00:25:09.720
You see, in other
words, each v and v

00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:14.250
has a unique representation,
unique representation,

00:25:14.250 --> 00:25:17.370
as a linear combination
of alpha 1 up to alpha n.

00:25:17.370 --> 00:25:20.400
By the way, if this process
doesn't come to an end,

00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:24.330
then v is set to be an
infinite-dimensional vector

00:25:24.330 --> 00:25:25.830
space.

00:25:25.830 --> 00:25:29.310
Now, what I'd like to do is
take a few minutes to summarize

00:25:29.310 --> 00:25:30.750
this particular lecture.

00:25:30.750 --> 00:25:32.790
Because what we're going
to be doing between now

00:25:32.790 --> 00:25:36.090
and the next lecture is going
to involve a lot of work

00:25:36.090 --> 00:25:37.230
on your part.

00:25:37.230 --> 00:25:39.990
And that is, that in going
through this overview of what

00:25:39.990 --> 00:25:42.480
you mean by dimension, and
spanning sets, and what

00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:45.210
have you, and linear
dependence and independence,

00:25:45.210 --> 00:25:47.620
many subtleties have occurred.

00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:51.060
For example, if I have an
n-dimensional vector space

00:25:51.060 --> 00:25:53.820
going through this bit of
constructing the space spanned

00:25:53.820 --> 00:25:54.750
by alpha--

00:25:54.750 --> 00:25:57.660
alpha 1 and alpha 2, et
cetera-- questions come up.

00:25:57.660 --> 00:25:59.850
What if I had started
with different vectors?

00:25:59.850 --> 00:26:02.940
What if I had started with
beta 1 instead of alpha 1,

00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:06.540
and then picked a new vector,
beta 2 instead of alpha 2?

00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:11.520
Could I have spanned v
in fewer than n vectors?

00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:14.190
In other words,
does the dimension

00:26:14.190 --> 00:26:17.610
depend on the process by
which I span the space by how

00:26:17.610 --> 00:26:18.600
I choose the vectors?

00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:23.040
Obviously, if this happens to
be true, we're in dire trouble.

00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:25.350
Because we would like
to believe intuitively,

00:26:25.350 --> 00:26:27.870
based on our old
definition of dimension,

00:26:27.870 --> 00:26:29.370
that the dimension
of a vector space

00:26:29.370 --> 00:26:31.470
should not depend on
the representative

00:26:31.470 --> 00:26:32.430
vectors that you pick.

00:26:32.430 --> 00:26:35.580
This is what's bad about
the n-tuple representation.

00:26:35.580 --> 00:26:39.480
So you see, what we're going
to do in the exercises is show

00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:42.660
what other ingredients
come up in dimension

00:26:42.660 --> 00:26:44.280
and what we have to worry about.

00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:47.340
In our next lecture, we
will summarize the results

00:26:47.340 --> 00:26:49.350
that we will prove
in the exercises.

00:26:49.350 --> 00:26:50.880
So you can begin
the next lecture

00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:53.850
even if you're a little bit
hazy on some of the exercises.

00:26:53.850 --> 00:26:56.650
And then we will show, from
a practical point of view,

00:26:56.650 --> 00:26:59.040
once the theory is
developed, how do we actually

00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:01.980
go about constructing a basis.

00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:04.750
How do we find what a
dimension is in real life?

00:27:04.750 --> 00:27:08.670
How do we figure out how to
construct the alphas if we're

00:27:08.670 --> 00:27:11.370
not given the abstract
situation mentioned

00:27:11.370 --> 00:27:12.630
in this particular example?

00:27:12.630 --> 00:27:16.020
At any rate, all I want to
do now is review the lecture,

00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:19.260
do the exercises, start to
feel at home with the concepts,

00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:22.890
and we will drill more on this
and review in our next lecture.

00:27:22.890 --> 00:27:24.760
At any rate, then,
until next time.

00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:25.260
Goodbye.

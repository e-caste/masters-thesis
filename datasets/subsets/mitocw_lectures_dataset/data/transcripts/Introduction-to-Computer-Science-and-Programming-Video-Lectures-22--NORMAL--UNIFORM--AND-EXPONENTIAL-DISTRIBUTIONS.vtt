00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.420
PROFESSOR: So, if you remember,
just before the

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:30.710
break, as long ago as it was,
we had looked at the problem

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.520
of fitting curves to data.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:42.690
And the example we had seen, is
that it's often possible,

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:49.060
in fact, usually possible, to
find a good fit to old values.

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:51.460
What we looked at was, we looked
at a small number of

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.800
points, we took a high degree
polynomial, sure enough, we

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.970
got a great fit.

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:03.210
The difficulty was, a great
fit to old values does not

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:24.840
necessarily imply a good
fit to new values.

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:31.150
And in general, that's
somewhat worrisome.

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.560
So now I want to spend a little
bit of time I'm looking

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.850
at some tools, that we can use
to better understand the

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.190
notion of, when we have a
bunch of points, what

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:45.220
do they look like?

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.610
How does the variation work?

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.680
This gets back to a concept that
we've used a number of

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:59.540
times, which is a notion
of a distribution.

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:04.860
Remember, the whole logic
behind our idea of using

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:11.340
simulation, or polling, or any
kind of statistical technique,

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.160
is the assumption that the
values we would draw were

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.650
representative of the values
of the larger population.

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.540
We're sampling some subset of
the population, and we're

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.150
assuming that that sample is
representative of the greater

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.700
population.

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.170
We talked about several
different

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.130
issues related to that.

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.400
I now want to look at that a
little bit more formally.

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:47.760
And we'll start with the very
old problem of rolling dice.

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.026
I presume you've all
seen what a pair of

00:02:50.026 --> 00:02:51.570
dice look like, right?

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.590
They've got the numbers 1
through 6 on them, you roll

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.730
them and something comes up.

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.700
If you haven't seen it, if you
look at the very back, at the

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.040
back page of the handout today,
you'll see a picture of

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.740
a very old die.

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:11.040
Some time from the fourth to
the second century BC.

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.260
Looks remarkably like a modern
dice, except it's not made out

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.610
of plastic, it's made
out of bones.

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:20.970
And in fact, if you were
interested in the history of

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.790
gambling, or if you happen to
play with dice, people do call

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.610
them bones.

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:28.320
And that just dates back to
the fact that the original

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.770
ones were made that way.

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:35.505
And in fact, what we'll see
is, that in the history of

00:03:35.505 --> 00:03:39.020
probability and statistics, an
awful lot of the math that we

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:42.240
take for granted today, came
from people's attempts to

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:46.290
understand various
games of chance.

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.230
So, let's look at it.

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.610
So we'll look at this program.

00:03:53.610 --> 00:04:05.660
You should have this in the
front of the handout.

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:08.960
So I'm going to start
with a fair dice.

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:11.660
That is to say, when you roll
it, it's equally probable that

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:18.360
you get 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:20.830
And I'm going to throw a pair.

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:23.930
You can see it's very simple.

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:30.910
I'll take d 1, first die is
random dot choice from vals 1.

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:34.370
d 2 will be random dot
choice from vals 2.

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:40.100
So I'm going to pass it in two
sets of possible values, and

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:45.710
randomly choose one or the
other, and then return them.

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:49.660
And the way I'll conduct a
trial is, I'll take some

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:53.940
number of throws, and two
different kinds of dice.

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:58.840
Throws will be the empty
set, actually, yeah.

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.070
And then I'll just do it.

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:06.270
For i in range number of throws,
d 1, d 2 is equal to

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:08.480
throw a pair, and then
I'll append it, and

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:12.940
then I'll return it.

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:14.660
Very simple, right?

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:19.130
Could hardly imagine a simpler
little program.

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:21.740
And then, we'll analyze it.

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:22.960
And we're going to analyze it.

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.430
Well, first let's analyze it one
way, and then we'll look

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:41.050
at something slightly
different.

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:43.200
I'm going to conduct some
number of trials

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:46.120
with two fair die.

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:50.270
Then I'm going to make a
histogram, because I happen to

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:55.730
know that there are only
11 possible values,

00:05:55.730 --> 00:06:01.600
I'll make 11 bins.

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.620
You may not have seen
this locution

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:06.710
here, Pylab dot x ticks.

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:10.680
That's telling it where to put
the markers on the x-axis, and

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:12.460
what they should be.

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:16.450
In this case 2 through 12,
and then I'll label it.

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:29.960
So let's run this program.

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:34.760
And here we see the distribution
of values.

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:39.220
So we see that I get more 7s
than anything else, and fewer

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:42.320
2s and 12s.

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:47.540
Snake eyes and boxcars
to you gamblers.

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:51.090
And it's a beautiful
distribution, in some sense.

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:53.150
I ran it enough trials.

00:06:53.150 --> 00:07:01.240
This kind of distribution
is called normal.

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:03.780
Also sometimes called
Gaussian, after the

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:07.060
mathematician Gauss.

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:12.110
Sometimes called the bell curve,
because in someone's

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:16.650
imagination it looks
like a bell.

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:22.370
We see these things
all the time.

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:27.110
They're called normal, or
sometimes even natural,

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:30.800
because it's probably the most
commonly observed probability

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:35.460
distribution in nature.

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:40.240
First documented, although I'm
sure not first seen, by

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:44.470
deMoivre and Laplace
in the 1700s.

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:48.340
And then in the 1800s, Gauss
used it to analyze

00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:51.980
astronomical data.

00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:54.280
And it got to be called, in
that case, the Gaussian

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:57.250
distribution.

00:07:57.250 --> 00:07:58.890
So where do we see it occur?

00:07:58.890 --> 00:08:00.870
We see it occurring all
over the place.

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:04.000
We certainly see it
rolling dice.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:09.180
We see it occur in things like
the distribution of heights.

00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:12.700
If we were to take the height of
all the students at MIT and

00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:17.100
plot the distribution, I would
be astonished if it didn't

00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:18.700
look more or less like that.

00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:22.280
It would be a normal
distribution.

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:24.050
A lot of things in
the same height.

00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:26.980
Now presumably, we'd have to
round off to the nearest

00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:29.380
millimeter or something.

00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:35.250
And a few really tall people,
and a few really short people.

00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:39.010
It's just astonishing in nature
how often we look at

00:08:39.010 --> 00:08:40.690
these things.

00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:44.900
The graph looks exactly like
that, or similar to that.

00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:47.880
The shape is roughly that.

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:53.460
The normal distribution can be
described, interestingly

00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:57.700
enough, with just two numbers.

00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:13.400
The mean and the standard
deviation.

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:15.920
So if I give you those
two numbers, you

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:18.540
can draw that curve.

00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:21.920
Now you might not be able to
label, you couldn't label the

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:25.210
axes, because how would
you know how many

00:09:25.210 --> 00:09:26.540
trials I did, right?

00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:29.720
Whether I did 100, or 1,000 or a
million, but the shape would

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:34.970
always be the same.

00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:39.180
And if I were to, instead of
doing, 100,000 throws of the

00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:44.030
dice, as I did here, I did a
million, the label on the

00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:47.310
y-axis would change,
but the shape would

00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:51.370
be absolutely identical.

00:09:51.370 --> 00:09:54.430
This is what's called a
stable distribution.

00:09:54.430 --> 00:10:14.160
As you change the scale, the
shape doesn't change.

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:18.370
So the mean tells us where
it's centered, and the

00:10:18.370 --> 00:10:23.500
standard deviation, basically,
is a measure of statistical

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:42.570
dispersion.

00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:45.400
It tells us how widely
spread the points of

00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:48.460
the data set are.

00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:52.420
If many points are going to be
very close to the mean, then

00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:57.650
the standard deviation is
what, big or small?

00:10:57.650 --> 00:10:59.090
Pardon?

00:10:59.090 --> 00:11:04.720
Small.

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:08.950
If they're spread out, and it's
kind of a flat bell, then

00:11:08.950 --> 00:11:13.750
the standard deviation
will be large.

00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:16.980
And I'm sure you've all seen
standard deviations.

00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:19.500
We give exams, and we say here's
the mean, here's the

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:22.630
standard deviation.

00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:25.170
And the notion is, that's trying
to tell you what the

00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:29.280
average score was, and how
spread out they are.

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:35.080
Now as it happens, rarely do
we have exams that actually

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:37.050
fall on a bell curve.

00:11:37.050 --> 00:11:38.270
Like this.

00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:44.710
So in a way, don't be deceived
by thinking that we're really

00:11:44.710 --> 00:11:48.790
giving you a good measure of the
dispersion, in the sense,

00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:52.880
that we would get with
the bell curve.

00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:58.420
So the standard deviation does
have a formal value, usually

00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:11.440
written sigma, and it's the
estimates of x squared minus

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:18.840
the estimates of x, and then
I take all of this, the

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:26.790
estimates of x, right,
squared.

00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:29.300
So I don't worry much about
this, but what I'm basically

00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:36.200
doing is, x is all of the
values I have. And I can

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:44.500
square each of the values, and
then I subtract from that, the

00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:50.670
sum of the values,
squaring that.

00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:54.730
What's more important than this
formula, for most uses,

00:12:54.730 --> 00:13:03.480
is what people think of as the
-- why didn't I write it down

00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:07.580
-- this is interesting.

00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:09.260
There is a some number --

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:10.930
I see why, I did write
it down, it just

00:13:10.930 --> 00:13:12.280
got printed on two-sided.

00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:26.540
Is the Empirical Rule.

00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:35.370
And this applies for normal
distributions.

00:13:35.370 --> 00:13:38.680
So anyone know how much of the
data that you should expect to

00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:44.120
fall within one standard
deviation of the mean?

00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:49.200
68.

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:59.330
So 68% within one, 95% of the
data falls within two, and

00:13:59.330 --> 00:14:06.720
almost all of the data
within three.

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:11.080
These values are approximations,
by the way.

00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:20.070
So, this is, really 95% falls
within 1.96 standard

00:14:20.070 --> 00:14:23.530
deviations, it's not two.

00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:28.330
But this gives you a sense
of how spread out it is.

00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:33.770
And again, this applies only
for a normal distribution.

00:14:33.770 --> 00:14:37.650
If you compute the standard
deviation this way, and apply

00:14:37.650 --> 00:14:40.910
it to something other than a
normal distribution, there's

00:14:40.910 --> 00:14:52.130
no reason to expect that
Empirical Rule will hold.

00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:55.330
OK people with me on this?

00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:58.560
It's amazing to me how many
people in society talk about

00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:01.190
standard deviations
without actually

00:15:01.190 --> 00:15:02.860
knowing what they are.

00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:06.010
And there's another way to
look at the same data, or

00:15:06.010 --> 00:15:07.120
almost the same data.

00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:08.990
Since it's a random experiment,
it won't be

00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:22.220
exactly the same.

00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:28.670
So as before, we had the
distribution, and fortunately

00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:30.890
it looks pretty much
like the last one.

00:15:30.890 --> 00:15:32.950
We would've expected that.

00:15:32.950 --> 00:15:35.940
And I've now done something,
another way of looking at the

00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:42.050
same information, really, is,
I printed, I plotted, the

00:15:42.050 --> 00:15:46.900
probabilities of different
values.

00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:52.950
So we can see here that the
probability of getting a 7 is

00:15:52.950 --> 00:15:59.120
about 0.17 or something
like that.

00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:03.200
Now, since I threw 100,000 die,
it's not surprising that

00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:07.050
the probability of 0.17
looks about the same

00:16:07.050 --> 00:16:11.540
as 17,000 over here.

00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:15.770
But it's just a different way
of looking at things.

00:16:15.770 --> 00:16:21.480
Right, had I thrown some
different number, it might

00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:23.900
have been harder to visualize
what the probability

00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:26.000
distribution looked like.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.140
But we often do talk
about that.

00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:35.380
How probable is a
certain value?

00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:39.210
People who design games of
chance, by the way, something

00:16:39.210 --> 00:16:39.960
I've been meaning to say.

00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:42.690
You'll notice down here there's
just, when we want to

00:16:42.690 --> 00:16:45.840
save these things, there's
this little icon that's a

00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:48.800
floppy disk, to indicate
store.

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:51.260
And I thought maybe many of
you'd never seen a floppy

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:53.730
disk, so I decided
to bring one in.

00:16:53.730 --> 00:16:55.500
You've seen the icons.

00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:58.590
And probably by the time most of
you got, any you ever had a

00:16:58.590 --> 00:17:01.310
machine with a quote
floppy drive?

00:17:01.310 --> 00:17:04.030
Did it actually flop the disk?

00:17:04.030 --> 00:17:07.540
No, they were pretty rigid, but
the old floppy disks were

00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:09.840
really floppy.

00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:12.670
Hence they got the name.

00:17:12.670 --> 00:17:16.580
And, you know it's kind of like
a giant size version.

00:17:16.580 --> 00:17:19.800
And it's amazing how people will
probably continue to talk

00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:21.770
about floppy disks as
long as they talk

00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:24.270
about dialing a telephone.

00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:27.190
And probably none of you've ever
actually dialed a phone,

00:17:27.190 --> 00:17:29.820
for that matter, just
pushed buttons .

00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:33.040
But they used to have dials
that you would twirl.

00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:35.060
Anyway, I just thought everyone
should at least see a

00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:37.250
floppy disk once.

00:17:37.250 --> 00:17:40.140
This is, by the way, a very good
way to get data security.

00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:42.510
There's probably no way in the
world to read the information

00:17:42.510 --> 00:17:48.870
on this disk anymore.

00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:55.060
All right, as I said people
who design games of chance

00:17:55.060 --> 00:17:58.430
understand these probabilities
very well.

00:17:58.430 --> 00:18:02.010
So I'm gonna now look at, show
how we can understand these

00:18:02.010 --> 00:18:06.950
things in some other ways
of popular example.

00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:09.410
A game of dice.

00:18:09.410 --> 00:18:13.520
Has anyone here ever played
the game called craps?

00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:16.390
Did you win or lose money?

00:18:16.390 --> 00:18:18.050
You won.

00:18:18.050 --> 00:18:21.880
All right, you beat the odds.

00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:23.780
Well, it's a very popular
game, and I'm going to

00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:25.020
explain it to you.

00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:28.150
As you will see, this is not
an endorsement of gambling,

00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:30.370
because one of the things you
will notice is, you are likely

00:18:30.370 --> 00:18:32.590
to lose money if you do this.

00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:35.800
So I tend not, I don't do it.

00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:45.830
All right, so how does
a game of craps work?

00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:50.630
You start by rolling two dice.

00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:55.840
If you get a 7 or an 11, the
roller, we'll call that the

00:18:55.840 --> 00:19:01.490
shooter, you win.

00:19:01.490 --> 00:19:08.870
If you get a 2, 3, or
a 12, you lose.

00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:10.720
I'm assuming here, you're
betting what's

00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:12.690
called the pass line.

00:19:12.690 --> 00:19:14.720
There are different ways to bet,
this is the most common

00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:17.820
way to bet, we'll just
deal with that.

00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:27.150
If it's not any of these, what
you get is, otherwise, the

00:19:27.150 --> 00:19:37.330
number becomes what's
called the point.

00:19:37.330 --> 00:19:41.470
Once you've got the point, you
keep rolling the dice until 1

00:19:41.470 --> 00:19:44.540
of o things happens.

00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:56.430
You get a 7, in which case you
lose, or you get the point, in

00:19:56.430 --> 00:20:04.250
which case you win.

00:20:04.250 --> 00:20:07.420
So it's a pretty simple game.

00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:12.740
Very popular game.

00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:14.430
So I've implemented.

00:20:14.430 --> 00:20:18.400
So one of the interesting things
about this is, if you

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:22.160
try and actually figure out
what the probabilities are

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:25.700
using pencil and paper,
you can, but it gets

00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:33.670
a little bit involved.

00:20:33.670 --> 00:20:35.960
Gets involved because you have
to, all right, what are the

00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:38.890
odds of winning or losing
on the first throw?

00:20:38.890 --> 00:20:41.160
Well, you can compute those
pretty easily, and you can see

00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:43.550
that you'd actually win
more than you lose,

00:20:43.550 --> 00:20:44.920
on the first throw.

00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:48.030
But if you look at the
distribution of 7s and 11s and

00:20:48.030 --> 00:20:51.690
2s, 3s, and 12s, you add them
up, you'll see, well, this is

00:20:51.690 --> 00:20:53.890
more likely than this.

00:20:53.890 --> 00:20:55.900
But then you say, suppose
I don't get those.

00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:58.610
What's the likelihood of getting
each other possible

00:20:58.610 --> 00:21:02.070
point value, and then given that
point value, what's the

00:21:02.070 --> 00:21:04.900
likelihood of getting
that before a 7?

00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:07.720
And you can do it, but
it gets very tedious.

00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:11.450
So those of us who are
inclined to think

00:21:11.450 --> 00:21:15.430
computationally, and I hope by
now that's all of you as well

00:21:15.430 --> 00:21:19.270
as me, say well, instead of
doing the probabilities by

00:21:19.270 --> 00:21:22.420
hand, I'm just going to write
a little program.

00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:27.330
And it's a program that took me
maybe 10 minutes to write.

00:21:27.330 --> 00:21:34.240
You can see it's quite small,
I did it yesterday.

00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:39.620
So the first function here is
craps, it returns true if the

00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:43.350
shooter wins by betting
the pass line.

00:21:43.350 --> 00:21:46.380
And it's just does
what I said.

00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:48.860
Rolls them, if the total
is 1 or 11, it

00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:51.270
returns true, you win.

00:21:51.270 --> 00:21:54.750
If it's 2, 3, or 12, it returns
false, you lose.

00:21:54.750 --> 00:21:58.190
Otherwise the point
becomes the total.

00:21:58.190 --> 00:22:01.830
And then while true, I'll
just keep rolling.

00:22:01.830 --> 00:22:07.290
Until either, if the total gets
the point, I return true.

00:22:07.290 --> 00:22:09.930
Or if the total's equal
7, I return false.

00:22:09.930 --> 00:22:12.110
And that's it.

00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:15.590
So essentially I just took these
rules, typed them down,

00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:20.270
and I had my game.

00:22:20.270 --> 00:22:24.620
And then I'll simulate it will
some number of bets.

00:22:24.620 --> 00:22:28.980
Keeping track of the numbers
of wins and losses.

00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:31.950
Just by incrementing 1 or the
other, depending upon whether

00:22:31.950 --> 00:22:34.500
I return true or false.

00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:37.220
I'm going to, just to show what
we do, print the number

00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:39.410
of wins and losses.

00:22:39.410 --> 00:22:44.210
And then compute, how
does the house do?

00:22:44.210 --> 00:22:48.120
Not the gambler, but the person
who's running the game,

00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:49.610
the casino.

00:22:49.610 --> 00:22:53.720
Or in other circumstances,
other places.

00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:56.910
And then we'll see
how that goes.

00:22:56.910 --> 00:23:00.570
And I'll try it with
100,000 games.

00:23:00.570 --> 00:23:03.940
Now, this is more than 100,000
rolls of the dice, right?

00:23:03.940 --> 00:23:08.730
Because I don't get a 7
or 11, I keep rolling.

00:23:08.730 --> 00:23:15.790
So before I do it, I'll as the
easy question first. Who

00:23:15.790 --> 00:23:21.990
thinks the casino wins more
often than the player?

00:23:21.990 --> 00:23:26.150
Who thinks the player wins more
often than the casino?

00:23:26.150 --> 00:23:30.090
Well, very logical, casinos are
not in business of giving

00:23:30.090 --> 00:23:32.870
away money.

00:23:32.870 --> 00:23:34.800
So now the more interesting
question.

00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:38.770
How steep do you think the odds
are in the house's favor?

00:23:38.770 --> 00:23:43.980
Anyone want to guess?

00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:45.040
Actually pretty thin.

00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:57.850
Let's run it and see.

00:23:57.850 --> 00:24:02.800
So what we see is, the house
wins 50, in this case 50.424%

00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:04.770
of the time.

00:24:04.770 --> 00:24:06.360
Not a lot.

00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:08.570
On the other hand, if
people bet 100,000,

00:24:08.570 --> 00:24:14.200
the house wins 848.

00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:23.010
Now, 100,000 is actually
a small number.

00:24:23.010 --> 00:24:25.780
Let's get rid of these, should
have gotten rid of these

00:24:25.780 --> 00:24:53.560
figures, you don't need to
see them every time.

00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:58.240
We'll keep one figure,
just for fun.

00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:04.850
Let's try it again.

00:25:04.850 --> 00:25:06.300
Probably get a little
different answer.

00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:11.650
Considerable different, but
still, less than 51% of the

00:25:11.650 --> 00:25:13.270
time in this trial.

00:25:13.270 --> 00:25:16.070
But you can see that the house
is slowly but surely going to

00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:20.570
get rich playing this game.

00:25:20.570 --> 00:25:24.650
Now let's ask the other
interesting question.

00:25:24.650 --> 00:25:29.330
Just for fun, suppose
we want to cheat.

00:25:29.330 --> 00:25:32.670
Now, I realize none of you
would never do that.

00:25:32.670 --> 00:25:36.750
But let's consider using
a pair of loaded dice.

00:25:36.750 --> 00:25:39.870
So there's a long history, well
you can imagine when you

00:25:39.870 --> 00:25:43.480
looked at that old bone I showed
you, that it wasn't

00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:44.960
exactly fair.

00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:47.940
That some sides were a little
heavier than others, and in

00:25:47.940 --> 00:25:52.970
fact you didn't get, say, a
5 exactly 1/6 of the time.

00:25:52.970 --> 00:25:55.430
And therefore, if you were using
your own dice, instead

00:25:55.430 --> 00:25:57.950
of somebody else's, and you knew
what was most likely, you

00:25:57.950 --> 00:26:00.070
might do better.

00:26:00.070 --> 00:26:02.560
Well, the modern version of that
is, people do cheat by

00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:06.430
putting little weights in
dice, to just make tiny

00:26:06.430 --> 00:26:09.210
changes in the probability
of one number or

00:26:09.210 --> 00:26:11.240
another coming up.

00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:14.570
So let's do that.

00:26:14.570 --> 00:26:16.560
And let's first ask the
question, well, what would be

00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:20.250
a nice way to do that?

00:26:20.250 --> 00:26:24.540
It's very easy here.

00:26:24.540 --> 00:26:37.290
If we look at it, all I've
done is, I've changed the

00:26:37.290 --> 00:26:41.210
distribution of values, so
instead of here being 1, 2, 3,

00:26:41.210 --> 00:26:46.270
4, 5, and 6, it's 1, 2,
3, 4, 5, 5, and 6.

00:26:46.270 --> 00:26:51.520
I snuck in an extra 5 on
one of the two dice.

00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:59.300
So this has changed the odds of
rolling a 5 from 1 in 6 to

00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:04.150
roughly 3 in 12.

00:27:04.150 --> 00:27:09.510
Now 1/6, which is 2/12, vs.
3/12, it's not a big

00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:10.790
difference.

00:27:10.790 --> 00:27:12.950
And you can imagine, if you were
sitting there watching

00:27:12.950 --> 00:27:17.130
it, you wouldn't notice that 5
was coming up a little bit

00:27:17.130 --> 00:27:19.830
more often than you expected.

00:27:19.830 --> 00:27:21.150
Normally.

00:27:21.150 --> 00:27:23.750
Close enough that you
wouldn't notice it.

00:27:23.750 --> 00:27:28.800
But let's see if, what
difference it makes?

00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:30.590
What difference do you think
it will make here?

00:27:30.590 --> 00:27:32.840
First of all, is it going
to be better or

00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:36.110
worse for the player?

00:27:36.110 --> 00:27:39.830
Who thinks better?

00:27:39.830 --> 00:27:42.500
Who thinks worse?

00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:45.650
Who thinks they haven't
a clue?

00:27:45.650 --> 00:27:48.640
All right, we have
an honest man.

00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:52.130
Where is Diogenes when
we we need him?

00:27:52.130 --> 00:27:55.650
The reward for honesty.

00:27:55.650 --> 00:27:58.030
I could reward you and wake
him up at the same time.

00:27:58.030 --> 00:28:01.340
It's good.

00:28:01.340 --> 00:28:16.810
All right, well, let's
see what happens.

00:28:16.810 --> 00:28:21.095
All right, so suddenly, the odds
have swung in favor of

00:28:21.095 --> 00:28:23.090
the player.

00:28:23.090 --> 00:28:28.030
This tiny little change has now
made it likely that the

00:28:28.030 --> 00:28:33.440
player win money, instead
of the house.

00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:34.300
So what's the point?

00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:36.730
The point is not, you should
go out and try and cheat

00:28:36.730 --> 00:28:41.070
casinos, because you'll probably
find an unpleasant

00:28:41.070 --> 00:28:42.880
consequence of that.

00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:47.700
The point is that, once I've
written this simulation, I can

00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:52.480
play thought experiments
in a very easy way.

00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:53.870
So-called what if games.

00:28:53.870 --> 00:28:54.820
What if we did this?

00:28:54.820 --> 00:28:56.690
What if we did that?

00:28:56.690 --> 00:28:59.680
And it's trivial to do those
kinds of things.

00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:03.000
And that's one of the reasons we
typically do try and write

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:04.640
these simulations.

00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:09.080
So that we can experiment
with things.

00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:11.070
Are there any other experiments
people would like

00:29:11.070 --> 00:29:13.500
to perform while we're here?

00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:18.280
Any other sets of die you
might like to try?

00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:22.060
All right, someone give me a
suggestion of something that

00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:24.320
might work in the
house's favor.

00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:27.120
Suppose a casino wanted
to cheat.

00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:28.430
What do you think would
help them out?

00:29:28.430 --> 00:29:28.690
Yeah?

00:29:28.690 --> 00:29:32.594
STUDENT: Increase prevalence
of 1, instead of 5?

00:29:32.594 --> 00:29:34.760
PROFESSOR: All right, so let's
see if we increase the

00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:52.210
probability of 1,
what it does?

00:29:52.210 --> 00:29:58.490
Yep, clearly helped the
house out, didn't it?

00:29:58.490 --> 00:30:04.750
So that would be a good
thing for the house.

00:30:04.750 --> 00:30:08.840
Again, you know, three key
strokes and we get to try it.

00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:15.350
It's really a very nice kind
of thing to be able to do.

00:30:15.350 --> 00:30:19.320
OK, this works nicely.

00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:21.350
We'll get normal
distributions.

00:30:21.350 --> 00:30:24.210
We can look at some things.

00:30:24.210 --> 00:30:26.130
There are two other kinds
of distributions I

00:30:26.130 --> 00:30:27.190
want to talk about.

00:30:27.190 --> 00:30:40.680
We can get rid of this
distraction.

00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:43.492
As you can imagine, I played a
lot with these things, just

00:30:43.492 --> 00:30:52.310
cause it was fun
once I had it.

00:30:52.310 --> 00:30:57.170
You have these in
your handout.

00:30:57.170 --> 00:31:01.800
So the one on the upper right,
is the Gaussian, or normal,

00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:07.800
distribution we've been
talking about.

00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:12.080
As I said earlier, quite common,
we see it a lot.

00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:17.090
The upper left is what's called
a, and these, by the

00:31:17.090 --> 00:31:19.550
way, all of these distributions
are symmetric,

00:31:19.550 --> 00:31:23.110
just in this particular
picture.

00:31:23.110 --> 00:31:26.750
How do you spell symmetric,
one or two m's?

00:31:26.750 --> 00:31:29.420
I help here.

00:31:29.420 --> 00:31:30.290
That right?

00:31:30.290 --> 00:31:32.720
OK, thank you.

00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:35.720
And they're symmetric in the
sense that, if you take the

00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:40.280
mean, it looks the same on
both sides of the mean.

00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:43.370
Now in general, you can
have asymmetric

00:31:43.370 --> 00:31:48.260
distributions as well.

00:31:48.260 --> 00:31:51.830
But for simplicity, we'll here
look at symmetric ones.

00:31:51.830 --> 00:31:54.950
So we've seen the bell curve,
and then on the upper left is

00:31:54.950 --> 00:32:04.290
what's called the uniform.

00:32:04.290 --> 00:32:09.690
In a uniform distribution, each
value in the range is

00:32:09.690 --> 00:32:15.810
equally likely.

00:32:15.810 --> 00:32:18.960
So to characterize it,
you only need to give

00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:21.930
the range of values.

00:32:21.930 --> 00:32:26.250
I say the values range from
0 to 100, and it tells me

00:32:26.250 --> 00:32:30.050
everything I know about the
uniform distribution.

00:32:30.050 --> 00:32:35.850
Each value in that will occur
the same number of times.

00:32:35.850 --> 00:32:39.970
Have we seen a uniform
distribution?

00:32:39.970 --> 00:32:46.350
What have we seen that's
uniform here?

00:32:46.350 --> 00:32:46.650
Pardon?

00:32:46.650 --> 00:32:48.620
STUDENT: Playing dice.

00:32:48.620 --> 00:32:49.990
PROFESSOR: Playing dice.

00:32:49.990 --> 00:32:51.580
Exactly right.

00:32:51.580 --> 00:32:57.780
Each roll of the die
was equally likely.

00:32:57.780 --> 00:32:59.900
Between 1 and 6.

00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:03.610
So, we got a normal distribution
when I summed

00:33:03.610 --> 00:33:09.710
them, but if I gave you the
distribution of a single die,

00:33:09.710 --> 00:33:11.870
it would have been
uniform, right?

00:33:11.870 --> 00:33:14.340
So there's an interesting
lesson there.

00:33:14.340 --> 00:33:18.060
One die, the distribution was
uniform, but when I summed

00:33:18.060 --> 00:33:27.700
them, I ended up getting
a normal distribution.

00:33:27.700 --> 00:33:29.870
So where else do we see them?

00:33:29.870 --> 00:33:34.070
In principle, lottery winners
are uniformly distributed.

00:33:34.070 --> 00:33:38.480
Each number is equally
likely to come up.

00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:41.640
To a first approximation,
birthdays are uniformly

00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:44.670
distributed, things like that.

00:33:44.670 --> 00:33:49.710
But, in fact, they rarely
arise in nature.

00:33:49.710 --> 00:33:52.350
You'll hardly ever run a physics
experiment, or a

00:33:52.350 --> 00:33:55.440
biology experiment, or anything
like that, and come

00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:58.100
up with a uniform
distribution.

00:33:58.100 --> 00:34:04.810
Nor do they arise very often in
complex systems. So if you

00:34:04.810 --> 00:34:07.970
look at what happens in
financial markets, none of the

00:34:07.970 --> 00:34:10.500
interesting distributions
are uniform.

00:34:10.500 --> 00:34:13.680
You know, the prices of stocks,
for example, are

00:34:13.680 --> 00:34:16.250
clearly not uniformly
distributed.

00:34:16.250 --> 00:34:19.820
Up days and down days in the
stock market are not uniformly

00:34:19.820 --> 00:34:22.780
distributed.

00:34:22.780 --> 00:34:28.700
Winners of football games are
not uniformly distributed.

00:34:28.700 --> 00:34:32.160
People seem to like to use
them in games of chance,

00:34:32.160 --> 00:34:35.120
because they seem fair, but
mostly you see them only in

00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:39.750
invented things, rather
than real things.

00:34:39.750 --> 00:34:41.800
The third kind of distribution,
the one in the

00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:55.010
bottom, is the exponential
distribution.

00:34:55.010 --> 00:34:59.360
That's actually quite common
in the real world.

00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:05.560
It's often used, for example,
to model arrival times.

00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:08.170
If you want to model the
frequency at which, say,

00:35:08.170 --> 00:35:16.040
automobiles arrive, get on the
Mass Turnpike, you would find

00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:20.750
that the arrivals
are exponential.

00:35:20.750 --> 00:35:25.180
We see with an exponential is,
things fall off much more

00:35:25.180 --> 00:35:34.700
steeply around the mean than
with the normal distribution.

00:35:34.700 --> 00:35:40.520
All right, that make sense?

00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:43.960
What else is exponentially
distributed?

00:35:43.960 --> 00:35:48.090
Requests for web pages are
often exponentially

00:35:48.090 --> 00:35:49.170
distributed.

00:35:49.170 --> 00:35:52.890
The amount of traffic
at a website.

00:35:52.890 --> 00:35:55.290
How frequently they arrive.

00:35:55.290 --> 00:35:59.640
We'll see much more starting
next week, or maybe even

00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:03.260
starting Thursday, about
exponential distributions, as

00:36:03.260 --> 00:36:06.370
we go on with a final case study
that we'll be dealing

00:36:06.370 --> 00:36:09.960
with in the course.

00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:15.460
You can think of each of
these, by the way, as

00:36:15.460 --> 00:36:19.350
increasing order of
predictability.

00:36:19.350 --> 00:36:23.590
Uniform distribution means the
result is most unpredictable,

00:36:23.590 --> 00:36:27.390
it could be anything.

00:36:27.390 --> 00:36:34.750
A normal distribution says,
well, it's pretty predictable.

00:36:34.750 --> 00:36:37.170
Again, depending on the
standard deviation.

00:36:37.170 --> 00:36:44.090
If you guess the mean, you're
pretty close to right.

00:36:44.090 --> 00:36:47.730
The exponential is
very predictable.

00:36:47.730 --> 00:36:55.100
Most of the answers are
right around the mean.

00:36:55.100 --> 00:36:57.220
Now there are many other
distributions, there are

00:36:57.220 --> 00:37:01.330
Pareto distributions which
have fat tails, there are

00:37:01.330 --> 00:37:05.920
fractal distributions, there
are all sorts of things.

00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:09.580
We won't go into to
those details.

00:37:09.580 --> 00:37:13.090
Now, I hope you didn't find
this short excursion into

00:37:13.090 --> 00:37:17.610
statistics either too boring
or too confusing.

00:37:17.610 --> 00:37:21.350
The point was not to teach you
statistics, probability, we

00:37:21.350 --> 00:37:24.040
have multiple courses
to do that.

00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:27.040
But to give you some tools that
would help improve your

00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:31.450
intuition in thinking
about data.

00:37:31.450 --> 00:37:36.400
In closing, I want to give
a few words about

00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:38.830
the misuse of data.

00:37:38.830 --> 00:37:43.400
Since I think we misuse
data an awful lot.

00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:57.960
So, point number 0, as in the
most important, is beware of

00:37:57.960 --> 00:38:25.100
people who give you properties
of data, but not the data.

00:38:25.100 --> 00:38:29.130
We see that sort of thing
all the time.

00:38:29.130 --> 00:38:33.940
Where people come in, and they
say, OK, here it is, here's

00:38:33.940 --> 00:38:37.120
the mean value of the quiz,
and here's the standard

00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:42.460
deviation of the quiz, and that
just doesn't really tell

00:38:42.460 --> 00:38:44.840
you where you stand,
in some sense.

00:38:44.840 --> 00:38:47.630
Because it's probably not
normally distributed.

00:38:47.630 --> 00:38:50.030
You want to see the data.

00:38:50.030 --> 00:38:53.310
At the very least, if you see
the data, you can then say,

00:38:53.310 --> 00:38:57.060
yeah, it is normally
distributed, so the standard

00:38:57.060 --> 00:39:01.530
deviation is meaningful,
or not meaningful.

00:39:01.530 --> 00:39:05.880
So, whenever you can,
try and get, at

00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:14.840
least, to see the data.

00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:18.500
So that's 1, or 0.

00:39:18.500 --> 00:39:24.830
1 is, well, all right.

00:39:24.830 --> 00:39:38.060
I'm going to test your Latin.

00:39:38.060 --> 00:39:41.060
Cum hoc ergo propter hoc.

00:39:41.060 --> 00:39:43.920
All right.

00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:49.170
I need a Latin scholar
to translate this.

00:39:49.170 --> 00:39:53.870
Did not one of you take
Latin in high school?

00:39:53.870 --> 00:39:55.110
We have someone who did.

00:39:55.110 --> 00:39:55.570
Go ahead.

00:39:55.570 --> 00:39:59.119
STUDENT: I think it
means, with this,

00:39:59.119 --> 00:40:01.150
therefore, because of this.

00:40:01.150 --> 00:40:03.070
PROFESSOR: Exactly right.

00:40:03.070 --> 00:40:08.090
With this, therefore,
because of this.

00:40:08.090 --> 00:40:09.660
I'm glad that at least
one person

00:40:09.660 --> 00:40:12.800
has a classical education.

00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:16.660
I don't, by the way.

00:40:16.660 --> 00:40:19.610
Essentially what this is
telling us, is that

00:40:19.610 --> 00:40:39.970
correlation does not
imply causation.

00:40:39.970 --> 00:40:42.830
So sometimes two things
go together.

00:40:42.830 --> 00:40:45.310
They both go up, they
both go down.

00:40:45.310 --> 00:40:46.990
And people jump to the
conclusion that

00:40:46.990 --> 00:40:49.590
one causes the other.

00:40:49.590 --> 00:40:53.250
That there's a cause and
effect relationship.

00:40:53.250 --> 00:40:57.660
That is just not true.

00:40:57.660 --> 00:41:01.100
It's what's called a
logical fallacy.

00:41:01.100 --> 00:41:04.310
So we see some examples
of this.

00:41:04.310 --> 00:41:05.710
And you can get into
big trouble.

00:41:05.710 --> 00:41:08.230
So here's a very interesting
one.

00:41:08.230 --> 00:41:11.110
There was a very widely reported
epidemiological

00:41:11.110 --> 00:41:14.830
study, that's a medical study
where you get statistics about

00:41:14.830 --> 00:41:16.870
large populations.

00:41:16.870 --> 00:41:20.570
And it showed that women, who
are taking hormone replacement

00:41:20.570 --> 00:41:24.850
therapy, were found to have a
lower incidence of coronary

00:41:24.850 --> 00:41:28.570
heart disease than
women who didn't.

00:41:28.570 --> 00:41:32.320
This was a big study
of a lot of women.

00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:38.230
This led doctors to propose
that hormone replacement

00:41:38.230 --> 00:41:41.430
therapy for middle aged women
was protective against

00:41:41.430 --> 00:41:44.210
coronary heart disease.

00:41:44.210 --> 00:41:48.720
And in fact, in response to
this, a large number of

00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:50.640
medical societies recommended
this.

00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:55.310
And a large number of women
were given this therapy.

00:41:55.310 --> 00:42:00.810
Later, controlled trials showed
that in fact, hormone

00:42:00.810 --> 00:42:04.960
replacement therapy in women
caused a small and significant

00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:10.430
increase in coronary
heart disease.

00:42:10.430 --> 00:42:13.350
So they had taken the fact that
these were correlated,

00:42:13.350 --> 00:42:17.760
said one causes the other, made
a prescription, and it

00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:20.840
turned out to be
the wrong one.

00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:25.100
Now, how could this be?

00:42:25.100 --> 00:42:27.960
How could this be?

00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:33.320
It turned out that the women in
the original study who were

00:42:33.320 --> 00:42:39.120
taking the hormone replacement
therapy, tended to be from a

00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:43.760
higher socioeconomic group
than those who didn't.

00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:46.460
Because the therapy was not
covered by insurance, so the

00:42:46.460 --> 00:42:48.960
women who took it
were wealthy.

00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:52.000
Turns out wealthy people do a
lot of other things that are

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:54.010
protective of their hearts.

00:42:54.010 --> 00:42:57.520
And, therefore, are in general
healthier than poor people.

00:42:57.520 --> 00:42:59.370
This is not a surprise.

00:42:59.370 --> 00:43:02.590
Rich people are healthier
than poor people.

00:43:02.590 --> 00:43:09.090
And so in fact, it was this
third variable that was

00:43:09.090 --> 00:43:13.150
actually the meaningful one.

00:43:13.150 --> 00:43:14.460
This is what is called in

00:43:14.460 --> 00:43:30.500
statistics, a lurking variable.

00:43:30.500 --> 00:43:34.390
Both of the things they were
looking at in this study, who

00:43:34.390 --> 00:43:39.180
took the therapy, and who had a
heart disease, each of those

00:43:39.180 --> 00:43:42.320
was correlated with the
lurking variable of

00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:46.680
socioeconomic position.

00:43:46.680 --> 00:43:49.960
And so, in effect, there
was no cause and effect

00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:51.370
relationship.

00:43:51.370 --> 00:43:54.990
And once they did another study,
in which the lurking

00:43:54.990 --> 00:43:59.400
variable was controlled, and
they looked at heart disease

00:43:59.400 --> 00:44:02.620
among rich women separately
from poor women, with this

00:44:02.620 --> 00:44:07.060
therapy, they discovered that
therapy was not good.

00:44:07.060 --> 00:44:10.700
It was, in fact, harmful.

00:44:10.700 --> 00:44:16.290
So this is a very important
moral to remember.

00:44:16.290 --> 00:44:21.790
When you look at correlations,
don't assume cause and effect.

00:44:21.790 --> 00:44:25.540
And don't assume that there
isn't a lurking variable that

00:44:25.540 --> 00:44:29.940
really is the dominant factor.

00:44:29.940 --> 00:44:35.310
So that's one statistical, a
second statistical worry.

00:44:35.310 --> 00:44:48.260
Number 2 is, beware of what's
called, non-response bias.

00:44:48.260 --> 00:44:51.030
Which is another fancy
way of saying,

00:44:51.030 --> 00:45:05.120
non-representative samples.

00:45:05.120 --> 00:45:08.130
No one doing a study beyond
the trivial can sample

00:45:08.130 --> 00:45:11.590
everybody or everything.

00:45:11.590 --> 00:45:17.080
And only mind readers can be
sure of what they've missed.

00:45:17.080 --> 00:45:18.640
Unless, of course,
people choose to

00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:20.600
miss things on purpose.

00:45:20.600 --> 00:45:22.030
Which you also see.

00:45:22.030 --> 00:45:24.720
And that brings me to
my next anecdote.

00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:31.240
A former professor at the
University of Nebraska, who

00:45:31.240 --> 00:45:34.300
later headed a group called The
Family Research Institute,

00:45:34.300 --> 00:45:37.340
which some of you may have heard
about, claimed that gay

00:45:37.340 --> 00:45:43.610
men have an average life
expectancy of 43 years.

00:45:43.610 --> 00:45:46.570
And they did a study full of
statistics showing that this

00:45:46.570 --> 00:45:49.550
was the case.

00:45:49.550 --> 00:45:53.690
And the key was, they calculated
the figure by

00:45:53.690 --> 00:45:58.160
checking gay newspapers for
obituaries and news about

00:45:58.160 --> 00:46:00.170
stories of death.

00:46:00.170 --> 00:46:04.410
So they went through the gay
newspapers, took a list of

00:46:04.410 --> 00:46:08.190
everybody whose obituary
appeared, how old they were

00:46:08.190 --> 00:46:13.080
when they died, took the
average, and said it was 43.

00:46:13.080 --> 00:46:15.430
Then they did a bunch of
statistics, with all sorts of

00:46:15.430 --> 00:46:19.190
tests, showing how, you know,
what the curves look like, the

00:46:19.190 --> 00:46:21.310
distributions, and
the significance.

00:46:21.310 --> 00:46:25.130
All the math was valid.

00:46:25.130 --> 00:46:28.890
The problem was, it was a very
unrepresentative sample.

00:46:28.890 --> 00:46:29.680
What was the most

00:46:29.680 --> 00:46:32.990
unrepresentative
thing about it?

00:46:32.990 --> 00:46:33.480
Somebody?

00:46:33.480 --> 00:46:38.595
STUDENT: Not all deaths
have obituaries.

00:46:38.595 --> 00:46:40.930
PROFESSOR: Well, that's
one thing.

00:46:40.930 --> 00:46:41.820
That's certainly true.

00:46:41.820 --> 00:46:44.420
But what else?

00:46:44.420 --> 00:46:48.170
Well, not all gay people
are dead, right?

00:46:48.170 --> 00:46:51.370
So if you're looking at
obituaries, you're in fact

00:46:51.370 --> 00:46:52.690
only getting --

00:46:52.690 --> 00:46:56.310
I'm sure that's what you were
planning to say -- sorry.

00:46:56.310 --> 00:46:59.400
You're only getting the people
who are dead, so it's clearly

00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:02.970
going to make the number
look smaller, right?

00:47:02.970 --> 00:47:05.460
Furthermore, you're only getting
the ones that were

00:47:05.460 --> 00:47:09.720
reported in newspapers, the
newspapers are typically

00:47:09.720 --> 00:47:17.140
urban, rather than out in rural
areas, so it turns out,

00:47:17.140 --> 00:47:22.230
it's also biased against gays
who chose not come out of the

00:47:22.230 --> 00:47:26.400
closet, and therefore didn't
appear in these.

00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:29.410
Lots and lots of things
with the problems.

00:47:29.410 --> 00:47:31.260
Believe it or not, this
paper was published

00:47:31.260 --> 00:47:34.040
in a reputable journal.

00:47:34.040 --> 00:47:38.330
And someone checked all the
math, but missed the fact that

00:47:38.330 --> 00:47:49.100
all of that was irrelevant
because the sample was wrong.

00:47:49.100 --> 00:47:50.790
Data enhancement.

00:47:50.790 --> 00:47:53.500
It even sounds bad, right?

00:47:53.500 --> 00:47:56.820
You run an experiment, you get
your data, and you enhance it.

00:47:56.820 --> 00:47:59.460
It's kind of like when you ran
those physics experiments in

00:47:59.460 --> 00:48:02.640
high school, and you've got
answers that you knew didn't

00:48:02.640 --> 00:48:05.340
match the theory, so you
fudged the data?

00:48:05.340 --> 00:48:08.910
I know none of you would have
ever done that, but some

00:48:08.910 --> 00:48:09.850
people been known to do.

00:48:09.850 --> 00:48:12.380
That's not actually
what this means.

00:48:12.380 --> 00:48:16.260
What this means is, reading
more into the data than it

00:48:16.260 --> 00:48:19.390
actually implies.

00:48:19.390 --> 00:48:23.410
So well-meaning people are
often the guiltiest here.

00:48:23.410 --> 00:48:26.010
So here's another one
of my favorites.

00:48:26.010 --> 00:48:29.730
For example, there are people
who try to scare us into

00:48:29.730 --> 00:48:31.330
driving safely.

00:48:31.330 --> 00:48:33.920
Driving safely is
a good thing.

00:48:33.920 --> 00:48:36.280
By telling holiday deaths.

00:48:36.280 --> 00:48:39.790
So you'll read things like,
400 killed on the highways

00:48:39.790 --> 00:48:42.240
over long weekend.

00:48:42.240 --> 00:48:46.600
It sounds really bad, until
you observe the fact that

00:48:46.600 --> 00:48:51.940
roughly 400 people are killed
on any 3-day period.

00:48:51.940 --> 00:48:56.790
And in fact, it's no higher
on the holiday weekends.

00:48:56.790 --> 00:48:58.360
I'll bet you all thought
more people got

00:48:58.360 --> 00:48:59.580
killed on holiday weekends.

00:48:59.580 --> 00:49:02.330
Well, typically not.

00:49:02.330 --> 00:49:05.210
They just report how many died,
but they don't tell you

00:49:05.210 --> 00:49:12.440
the context, say, oh, by the
way, take any 3-day period.

00:49:12.440 --> 00:49:17.260
So the moral there is, you
really want to place the data

00:49:17.260 --> 00:49:20.250
in context.

00:49:20.250 --> 00:49:25.530
Data taken out of context
without comparison is usually

00:49:25.530 --> 00:49:27.460
meaningless.

00:49:27.460 --> 00:49:39.540
Another variance of this
is extrapolation.

00:49:39.540 --> 00:49:42.150
A commonly quoted statistic.

00:49:42.150 --> 00:49:45.300
Most auto accidents happen
within 10 miles of home.

00:49:45.300 --> 00:49:48.750
Anyone here heard
that statistic?

00:49:48.750 --> 00:49:53.080
It's true, but what
does it mean?

00:49:53.080 --> 00:49:55.730
Well, people tend to say it
means, it's dangerous to drive

00:49:55.730 --> 00:49:57.620
when you're near home.

00:49:57.620 --> 00:50:02.430
But in fact, most driving is
done within 10 miles of home.

00:50:02.430 --> 00:50:06.090
Furthermore, we don't actually
know where home is.

00:50:06.090 --> 00:50:09.370
Home is where the car is
supposedly garaged on the

00:50:09.370 --> 00:50:14.800
state registration forms. So,
data enhancements would

00:50:14.800 --> 00:50:18.650
suggest that I should register
my car in Alaska.

00:50:18.650 --> 00:50:20.980
And then I would never be
driving within 10 miles of

00:50:20.980 --> 00:50:24.100
home, and I would
be much safer.

00:50:24.100 --> 00:50:32.330
Well, it's probably
not a fact.

00:50:32.330 --> 00:50:37.020
So there are all sorts
of things on that.

00:50:37.020 --> 00:50:39.090
Well, I think I will come back
to this, because I have a

00:50:39.090 --> 00:50:42.090
couple more good stories which
I hate not to give you.

00:50:42.090 --> 00:50:45.750
So we'll come back on Thursday
and look at a couple of more

00:50:45.750 --> 00:50:48.180
things that can go wrong
with statistics.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
On Monday, we went through and
looked at the functional forms

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
for sp two hybrid
orbitals, as found in the case

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
of the BH three molecule.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Now, you should recognize that
there are other hybridization

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
schemes that go along with
different geometries.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
So, BH three was
trigonal planar.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
And we are going to talk some
more about BH three today.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
If you had been considering
last time instead a tetrahedral

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
carbon atom, then the
hybridization scheme we would

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
have needed to develop would
have been the sp three

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
hybridization scheme.
That would be associated with a

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
tetrahedral carbon atom.
On the other hand,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
if we had a linearly
coordinated carbon atom or some

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
other main group atom,
boron or beryllium,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
for example,
then we would have had to

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
develop the sp hybridization
scheme.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
You should not miss the forest
for the trees in putting into

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
context from my previous lecture
on the sp two specific

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000
case for that type of geometry.
But now, rather than going

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
through more examples of valance
bond theory treatments of

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
molecules, instead,
it is time for me to introduce

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
you to the tenants of the
molecular orbital theory for

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
treatment of molecular
electronic structure.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.000
I mentioned valance bond theory
as having been introduced by

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Linus Pauling.
And then, I also named Robert

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
S.
Mulliken, MIT undergraduate,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.000
as the father of molecular
orbital theory.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
And these are both two
different perspectives on

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000
viewing electron structure of
molecules that arises from the

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
results of quantum mechanics.
In the case of valance bond

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000
theory, we have a situation
where you have localized

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
electron pairs.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
In the case of molecular
orbital theory,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
electron pairs are still going
to be important,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
but they are going to be able
to be delocalized over the

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
entire molecule in some cases.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
So, this is very different.
This is a major difference

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
between MO theory and valance
bond theory.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
In the case of the BH three
molecule that we

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
considered last time,
you had four positively charged

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
nuclei.
And you arrange those four plus

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
charges at the points in space
that correspond to the

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
equilibrium geometry of the
molecule.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
And then you sprinkle in your
six valance electrons,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
and you want to understand how
those six electrons become

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:15.000
organized in space in response
to that electric field set up by

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
those four positively charged
nuclei.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
And we took the approach last
time that we are going to

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000
localize electron pairs in
between nuclei.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
And, because structurally the
BH three molecule is

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
symmetric and the three
hydrogens are indistinguishable

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
from one another,
we decided that we were going

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
to make hybrids.
And so we talk about

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
hybridization.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000
The idea behind hybridization
was to change the atomic

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000
orbitals of boron by mixing
them, so that we would have one

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000
that would be able to point at
each of the three hydrogens in

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
space to form three nicely,
perfectly directed electron

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
sigma bonds between boron and
hydrogen.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
That was the scheme that we
adopted, this hybridization

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
scheme, but in MO theory we are
not going to do that.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
We are not going to interfere
with the intrinsic atomic

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
orbital structure of a boron
atom in order to make bonds.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000
And we are going to see that
there are some predictions that

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
come out of the MO treatment for
the molecule that differ from

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000
those that came out of the
valance bond treatment for the

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.000
molecule.
And so here,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
no hybrids.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000
In terms of just the vernacular
of chemical structure,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:49.000
you will hear sp three
as being used interchangeably

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
with the notion of a
tetrahedron.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.000
But in valance bond theory,
it refers to a particular

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.000
hybridization scheme in which we
actually mix s and p as a

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:08.000
preparative to bond formation in
a molecule.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
And we mix the atomic orbitals
on that central atom in a

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
hybridization scheme.
In MO theory,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000
we are not going to do that.
It is very important that you

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000
keep these theories and the
language associated with the

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000
theories separate in your minds
so you can see the difference

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
between these theories.
And then one of the

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000
consequences of this valance
bond theory and the

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000
hybridization scheme is that it
is not so good for excited

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
states.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
And what that means is that we
were developing a scheme to

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
describe the bonding in the
molecule in its ground

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
electronic state.
Molecules can have excited

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000
states, just like atoms can have
electronic states.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
And over here,
in molecular orbital theory,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.000
we are going to find that we do
a much better job with excited

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
states.
And that is important for

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.000
understanding the range of
properties associated with

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
molecular systems.
And you are going to see,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.000
indeed, that the energy level
scheme for the six valance

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000
electrons in the BH three
molecule is different,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.000
depending on whether you use
valence bond theory or molecular

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.000
orbital theory.
Now, for molecular orbital

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000
theory, we are going to need,
again, like we do for valance

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:46.000
bonds, to have some kind of a
procedure for forming molecular

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
orbitals, conceptually.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000
And the first step in such a
procedure is that you are going

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
to want to analyze the
three-dimensional shape of the

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
molecule.
And we do this,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.000
of course, when we talk about
the valance-shell electron-pair

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:38.000
repulsion theory for predicting
molecular structure.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.000
We are going to look at the
structure.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:50.000
And we want to identify,
usually by inspection,

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.000
sets of symmetry-related --

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.000
-- atoms or orbitals.
And here, I am talking about

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:11.000
atomic orbitals.
I will come back in a moment

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000
and talk about what I mean by
symmetry-related.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:20.000
This is a concept that can be
put on a very nice,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:25.000
firm, mathematical footing.
And, in fact,

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.000
if you find this type of
analysis interesting and would

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:34.000
like to see more of the math
that can help you to organize

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000
the results of quantum mechanics
in terms of symmetry,

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:43.000
then you will want to put the
5.04 subject on your calendar

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
for the future.
That subject is devoted,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000
in large part,
to the applications of group

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
theory to chemistry and chemical
problems.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:58.000
And symmetry plays a big role
in that.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000
And then, two,
we are going to form

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:07.000
combinations.
And let me just further

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:14.000
quantify this by saying we are
going to form linear

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
combinations --

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
-- of symmetry-related
orbitals.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:50.000
One of the big approximations
that we usually kind of take for

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:57.000
granted in the molecular orbital
theory of electronic structure

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:02.000
is the LCAO approximation.
I am just going to mention that

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
parenthetically,
here.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:10.000
This is that we can form
molecular orbitals that will be

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
linear combinations of atomic
orbitals.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:19.000
This LCAO approximation arises
from the fact that we can solve

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:24.000
the Schrˆdinger equation exactly
for the hydrogen atom,

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000
but for big molecules and many
electrons systems,

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.000
we cannot.
And what we like to do is to

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
take the atomic orbital wave
functions, that is,

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:41.000
atomic orbital here in LCAO,
and use those wave functions in

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
our approximation of molecular
orbitals.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:48.000
We are saying that we can
combine these atomic orbitals on

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000
the atoms that are in a molecule
to form the molecular orbitals

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:57.000
that will be able to spread out
and delocalize over the entire

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000
molecule.
This is inherent in the

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:07.000
development of the theory that I
am working on here.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:13.000
And you should see that this
will pop up in a number of

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:19.000
cases, but it is an inherent
approximation that we are

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
accepting.
And then, three,

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:28.000
we are going to combine the
linear combinations from part

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
two --

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.000
-- with central atom atomic
orbitals.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:49.000
And that is what we will do.
And if we have done that

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:56.000
properly, we will have arrived
at molecular orbitals for the

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:01.000
system in question.
Now, I want to take a little

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:06.000
bit of time to go through each
one of these steps in order to

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000
define the problem that we have
for this alternative way of

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.000
viewing the electronic structure
of the BH three molecule.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
Now, why am I choosing the BH

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:21.000
three molecule for this?
Well, I am choosing it because

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
it is an easy problem and one
that is illustrative of the

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:30.000
steps that go into forming
molecular orbitals for a system.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000
In your textbook,
you will see that before you

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:40.000
get to something like BH three,
first diatomic

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:46.000
molecules are considered.
Those, I will show you on

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:52.000
Friday, are actually a little
trickier to understand than is

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:59.000
the case with BH three.
That is because in molecular

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:06.000
orbital theory we have the same
number of MOs as AOs.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:15.000
If we start out with a certain
number of atomic orbitals that

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000
come into play by virtue of the
atoms that are in the molecule,

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.000
then that number of orbitals
will be the same as the number

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.000
of molecular orbitals that we
will get at the end of the

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
problem.
They won't all be filled.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
We will have some that are
empty.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
But we are going to have the
same number of molecular

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.000
orbitals as atomic orbitals that
go into the problem.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000
And so what that means is that
the complexity of the problem is

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:48.000
related to the number of MOs
and, hence, the number of AOs.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:59.000
The complexity of the problem
scales with the number of atomic

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.000
orbitals in the problem.
We actually call these our

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
basis functions.
And one of the things that John

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:10.000
Pople talks about,
if you have gone and looked at

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
his video that I pointed you to
in the problem set,

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.000
he talks about the wonderful
fact that our computational

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:21.000
power has gotten so great,
and will grow so much greater

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
in the future,
that we are able to

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.000
computationally handle problems
of the calculations of the

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:31.000
properties of enormous molecules
that bring into a problem an

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000
enormous number,
a vast number of atomic

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.000
orbitals.
And so, a great computational

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:42.000
power is necessary to apply
molecular orbital theory,

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.000
or even the more recent density
functional theory,

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:51.000
to problems of electronic
structure that we need to

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:56.000
grapple with in order to predict
properties of molecular systems.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000
And in the BH three
molecule, which is,

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:05.000
as I said, a simple problem of
electronic structure and a nice

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:09.000
illustrative one for today's
purposes, we have,

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.000
this is a seven orbital
problem.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
Why is this a seven orbital
problem?

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:30.000
It is a seven orbital problem
because boron has four valance

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:34.000
orbitals, an s,
a px, a py, a pz.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:38.000
And we have three hydrogens,
each with their 1s orbital.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000
We have our valance orbitals on
boron.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:46.000
We don't count the 1s orbital
on boron because that is filled

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:51.000
and is a core orbital,
and it doesn't get involved in

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.000
chemical bonding.
The valance shell for boron is

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:59.000
the n equals two shell.
We have 2s, 2px,

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.000
2py and 2pz.
And we have three hydrogens,

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:09.000
each with their 1s orbital.
If we were to tackle right now

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:15.000
the problem of the molecular
orbital energy level diagram for

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:20.000
a diatomic molecule like O two,
dioxygen,

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:27.000
we would find immediately that
this analysis of how many atomic

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:34.000
orbitals we have available would
give us the value eight.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000
And so it is a more complicated
problem.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:41.000
It has one more atomic orbital
than this problem,

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:45.000
even though this one has four
atoms because three of these

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:50.000
atoms happen to be hydrogens,
which only bring in one orbital

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.000
to the problem.
That is why I am choosing this.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:58.000
And then, in addition,
I am choosing this because the

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:03.000
consequences of the symmetry of
the BH three molecule

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:07.000
are that the orbital
interactions that we are going

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:12.000
to identify occur in nice
pair-wise sets.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.000
And that makes things
especially easy to see in terms

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:21.000
of how chemical bonds arise in
the context of MO theory for a

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.000
problem like this.
And so, to now go ahead and

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:30.000
carry out step one for this,
we are going to draw the

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.000
molecule and try to identify
sets of symmetry-related

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:39.000
atoms/orbitals.
And, before you do that,

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:44.000
I just would like to show you
an example of a highly symmetric

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:49.000
molecule, because this notion of
symmetry is something that,

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:54.000
at this point in time,
I really only want you to gain

00:17:54.000 --> 00:18:00.000
an intuitive grasp of,
I am not going to quantify it.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:06.000
But, if you look at a molecule
like the one I have placed on

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:13.000
the left and right-hand screens,
you will see that it is a

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:18.000
large, round molecule.
Actually, round,

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:24.000
spherical things are the most
symmetric things that we can

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:29.000
think of.
Here, you can imagine that this

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:35.000
is a big ball with atoms located
at various points on the surface

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:39.000
of the ball.
This is just a ball and stick

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.000
representation of the C60
molecule, also known as

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:48.000
Buckminsterfullerene.
It is a geodesic dome-type of

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.000
molecule.
This molecule has the chemical

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:55.000
formula C60.
There are no hydrogens in this

00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:00.000
molecule.
All the atoms are displayed.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:04.000
And each carbon atom sits in a
position where it is adjacent to

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.000
one five-membered ring and two
six-membered rings on the

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.000
surface of this spherical
molecule.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.000
And that is true of every
carbon atom on the surface of

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.000
this whole molecule.
As you go on in chemistry,

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:21.000
if you go into the analysis of
molecules using nuclear magnetic

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.000
resonance spectroscopy,
you will find that it is really

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:30.000
important to be able to identify
the symmetry of a molecule.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.000
And you will realize that the
symmetry of the molecule is

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:38.000
manifest in the nuclear magnetic
resonance spectrum of a

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.000
molecule.
If you take the carbon-13

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:45.000
nuclear magnetic resonance
spectrum of this molecule,

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:49.000
a sample composed of this
molecule, you will see that

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:53.000
there is only a single C13
signal in the spectrum.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:57.000
And that is because all 60
carbon atoms are in an identical

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:03.000
environment in this molecule.
Every one of them feels exactly

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:07.000
like everyone else.
They are all equidistant from

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:11.000
the center of this molecule.
And they are all equidistant

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:16.000
from their set of neighbors.
And so, in that way of looking

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.000
at a molecule,
you would see that they are all

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.000
equivalent.
You may have encountered this

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.000
molecule before,
but this molecule's discovery

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:30.000
--
-- was actually predicted

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.000
initially from analysis of mass
spectrometry data by Professor

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:39.000
Smalley, a Nobel Prize winner
whose efforts in this area have

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:43.000
spawned off chemistries
involving not only these

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:47.000
nano-sized balls of matter,
but also nanotubes made of

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:52.000
carbon, and this whole area that
we think of nano technology.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:57.000
Really a lot of it is dominated
by the chemistry of new forms of

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:01.000
carbon that arose with the
discovery of

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:06.000
Buckminsterfullerene.
And that is just one example of

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:12.000
a new allotrope of carbon that
was discovered in recent years.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:15.000
This gives you an idea for
symmetry.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:19.000
I could show you pictures,
actually, of enormous

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:23.000
biomolecules.
There are large viruses that

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:28.000
are composed of biopolymers,
macromolecules that pack in a

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:33.000
way that is symmetrical,
so that you can see these

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:37.000
things.
If you view them in the right

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.000
kind of representation,
you will be able to see the

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:44.000
symmetry in them.
And one definition of symmetry

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:48.000
that I would like you to take
away from this picture is just

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.000
that each of the atoms that are
symmetry-related is

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:55.000
indistinguishable.
If you turn the molecule around

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:59.000
and look at the atoms,
those that are symmetry-related

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:03.000
are indistinguishable from one
another.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:07.000
And so, when we have a trigonal
planer BH three

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:11.000
molecule, is the boron symmetry
related to any of the other

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.000
atoms?
No, it is not.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:17.000
What about this hydrogen?
I labeled them last time A,

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:20.000
B, and C.
This hydrogen labeled C,

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.000
is it symmetry-related to other
hydrogens?

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.000
Yes.
And that is because of the

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:30.000
symmetry of this molecule with
these 120 degree bond angles on

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:36.000
the planarity of the molecule.
So, you have a set of three

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:39.000
hydrogens.
And their 1s orbitals are in

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:42.000
space indistinguishable from one
another.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:47.000
They are related by symmetry.
And so, in this problem here,

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:51.000
we have four orbitals here on
the boron that are not

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:55.000
symmetry-related.
And then also incidentally let

00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:00.000
me point out that the boron atom
is located at the center of

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:04.000
gravity of this system.
If atoms are going to be

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:08.000
symmetry-related,
they must not be located at the

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:13.000
center of gravity of the system.
Let's go over here and expand

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.000
on these ideas.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:39.000
The method that I am going to
develop here for forming the

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:44.000
linear combinations has to do
with thinking ahead,

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:48.000
in this problem,
to the fact that we are going

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:52.000
to want to make linear
combinations that have the

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:57.000
correct symmetry to bond to
atomic orbitals on the central

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:00.000
boron atom.
Let me draw the ones that are

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:03.000
going to be relevant to this
part of the problem.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:28.000
This one over here would be the
boron pz orbital,

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:33.000
so it has one positive lobe
coming out of the board,

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:37.000
negative lobe going back.
Over here we would have the

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:42.000
boron py orbital using the
coordinate system that I had

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:46.000
chosen last time,
which is x up and y to the

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:49.000
left.
And then here we have the

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:53.000
boron's px orbital.
And then over here we have the

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:59.000
boron's 2s orbital.
And so, our challenge now will

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:02.000
be to construct linear
combinations,

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:06.000
we are at part two,
of the set of three hydrogen 1s

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:10.000
orbitals that can match in
symmetry the boron central

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:13.000
atom's atomic orbitals.
Last time, remember,

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:17.000
for hybridization,
we were making these orbitals

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:21.000
mix with each other in order to
point at the hydrogens.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:27.000
Now what we are doing is kind
of an inverse concept.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:30.000
We are going to mix the
hydrogen orbitals so that they

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:34.000
have the right symmetry to
interact with the central atom

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:37.000
atomic orbitals.
There is a nice parallelism

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:40.000
here.
Here is going to be our LCs.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:53.000
They key feature of the boron's
2s orbital is that it does not

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:56.000
have any nodes.
Remember nodes are surfaces.

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:59.000
When you pass from one side of
a node to the other,

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:03.000
you get a change in sign of the
wave function.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:08.000
And we indicate that change in
sign by differential shading.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:11.000
The 2s orbital has no nodes
whatsoever.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:16.000
And a way that we can construct
a linear combination that has

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:20.000
the same spatial,
nodal properties as that boron

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:25.000
2s atomic orbital is as follows.
We can involve contributions

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:30.000
from each of the three hydrogen
1s orbitals.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:33.000
Remember this one is A,
this one is B,

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:37.000
and this one is C.
This is going to be a linear

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:40.000
combination of the three
hydrogen 1s orbitals.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:43.000
I will write this one as
follows.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:47.000
This one will be written as A
plus B plus C.

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:52.000
That indicates the 1s orbital
on A, plus the 1s orbital on B,

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:57.000
plus the 1s orbital on C.
And, as we talked about last

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:03.000
time, wave functions that we
write should be normalized.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:07.000
And they should satisfy the
unit orbital contribution rule.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:10.000
For normalization,
here, I give a factor of one

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:15.000
over root three for this linear
combination formed as a symmetry

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:18.000
match with the boron 2s orbital.
You can see,

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:22.000
I hope, what we are doing.
We are projecting the nodal

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:27.000
properties of the central atom
atomic orbitals onto the linear

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:31.000
combinations that we are
forming.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:36.000
And we are going to form a
complete set of three linear

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:40.000
combinations in this way.
Let's make one that has

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:45.000
symmetry properties that remind
us of this px orbital.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:50.000
On HA we are going to have a
positive contribution to match

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:56.000
the positive contribution of
this lobe of the px orbital that

00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:02.000
points along the plus x axis.
And then down here we are going

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:05.000
to have contributions from
hydrogens B and C.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:09.000
And they are going to be
smaller, and they are going to

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:13.000
be opposite in-phase.
They are going to be opposite

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:17.000
in-phase because we are building
a linear combination that has a

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:21.000
node approximately at the center
of the system here,

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:25.000
so as you go from positive x
into the negative x region of

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:30.000
space, the wave function changes
sign to match the change in sign

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:36.000
associated with the px orbital.
We are projecting the nodal

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:40.000
properties of px onto the linear
combination of hydrogen orbitals

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:43.000
that we are forming here.
And this one,

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:48.000
written in normalized fashion,
will be root two over three,

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.000
A minus one-half B minus
one-half C.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:55.000
And, although what we are

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:58.000
working with here are linear
combinations of these

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:02.000
symmetry-related hydrogen 1s
wave functions,

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:06.000
you are going to find that
these coefficients on the atomic

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:10.000
orbitals, that contribute
eventually to the molecular

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:14.000
orbitals, are going to come out
as normalized and as unit

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:20.000
orbital contributions.
So that if we started out this

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:24.000
problem with a single 1s orbital
on HA, that will be entirely

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:29.000
accounted for among these linear
combinations and the molecular

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:33.000
orbitals that we are going to
make with them.

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:37.000
Now, let's generate a linear
combination having the nodal

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:41.000
properties of py.
And, in order to do that,

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:46.000
we need to have a negative
coefficient out here in the

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:49.000
minus y direction.
We are going to put in a

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:53.000
contribution from HC as
negative, like that,

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:56.000
to match that.
And then over here,

00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:00.000
we are going to make a
contribution for HB that is

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:05.000
positive.
And then, noting that there is

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:08.000
a nodal plane along the
y,z-plane, which comes out of

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:12.000
the board like this,
so that we are always negative

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:15.000
along minus y and we are
positive along plus y.

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:19.000
We match that here.
And the coincidence of that

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:23.000
nodal plane with the location of
HA dictates no contribution from

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:27.000
HA to this orbital,
for reasons that actually we

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:30.000
looked at last time,
--

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:35.000
-- namely, that we cannot bring
a hydrogen 1s orbital in here

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:41.000
and also change sign on going
half-way through that hydrogen

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:46.000
1s orbital, because s orbitals
have to have the same sign

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:50.000
everywhere.
It does not contribute to this

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:54.000
linear combination.
And our normalized form for

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:58.000
this will be one over root two B
minus C.

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:04.000
And then, if I were to ask the

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:07.000
question, can I make a linear
combination of the three

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:11.000
hydrogen 1s orbitals that has
the same nodal properties as pz,

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:15.000
the answer would be no because
they all lie in the x,y-plane

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:20.000
and they are just s orbitals and
cannot change sign as you go

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:23.000
through the x,y-plane from plus
z to minus z.

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:26.000
And so, we are done here.
And what you are going to find

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:30.000
is that we have created these
three linear combination

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:35.000
according to step two.
And taking into account both

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:39.000
the symmetry properties of the
molecule to identify a set of

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:42.000
three symmetry-related atoms and
orbitals.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:47.000
And then, taking into account
an analysis of the nodal

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:50.000
properties of the central atom
atomic orbitals,

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:55.000
so that we could project those
out to help us find appropriate

00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:01.000
linear combinations for mixing
with the central atom orbitals.

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:14.000
And, when we do that mixing,
we are going to find out that

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:17.000
there are three ways that we can
do it.

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:21.000
We are about to move onto step
three of this problem.

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:26.000
We are going to need to combine
these linear combinations with

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:31.000
the central atom atomic orbitals
according to the rules of MO

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:35.000
theory to generate,
first, bonding molecular

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:37.000
orbitals.

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:50.000
And the bonding molecular
orbitals that we will get will

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:54.000
be an in-phase combination --

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:04.000
-- of our LCs,
our linear combinations of

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:09.000
atomic orbitals,
with our boron atomic orbitals.

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:14.000
That will describe the chemical
bonding in our system.

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:19.000
And we will see that it
contrasts in a very interesting

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:24.000
way with the hybridization
scheme developed last time.

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:27.000
And the key phrase to
underline, here,

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:32.000
is in-phase.
And what that in-phase means is

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:36.000
that when two positive lobes of
two orbitals centered on two

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:40.000
different atoms are juxtaposed
and neighbor one another and can

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:44.000
have good overlap of their
atomic orbital wave functions,

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:48.000
that leads to in-phase
constructive interference and

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:52.000
stabilization of the electrons
associated with that newly

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:54.000
formed bonding molecular
orbital.

00:33:54.000 --> 00:34:00.000
And that stabilization is what
we call the chemical bond.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:04.000
The analogy to that in valence
bond theory is the idea that a

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:08.000
pair of electrons associated
with two nuclei in a sigma bond

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:11.000
is more stable because it
experiences, simultaneously,

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:15.000
two positive charges.
And here we are generalizing

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:19.000
that and allowing electrons to
flow over the molecule as a

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:21.000
whole.
But now we have a new concept,

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:24.000
and that is antibonding.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:36.000
Antibonding molecular orbitals
will be out-of-phase

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:42.000
combinations that are repulsive
and lead to high energy

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:45.000
interactions.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:55.000
And when, as in the case of the
problem we are considering here,

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:58.000
the interactions occur in
pair-wise sets,

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:03.000
we will find that we get very
nicely, for every bonding

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:07.000
molecular orbital,
a corresponding anti-bonding

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:10.000
molecular orbital.

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:18.000
Also, one of the interesting
things is that if you start

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.000
putting electrons into
anti-bonding orbitals,

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:23.000
if your system just happens to
be so constructed as to have

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:26.000
many electrons,
such that you fill up not only

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:29.000
the bonding molecular orbitals
of electrons to make the

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:31.000
chemical bonds,
but you continue on and you

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:34.000
have enough electrons to keep
going and put them into

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:37.000
anti-bonding orbitals,
those antibonds start to cancel

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:40.000
the bonds.
And so, you will see a very

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:44.000
nice progression of this as we
study the MO theory of the

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:48.000
homonuclear diatomic molecules,
starting on Friday.

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:52.000
And then, here is another
concept that arises from the MO

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:55.000
analysis of a molecule,
and that is that certain

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:58.000
orbitals can be non-bonding.

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:10.000
And an example of this would be
a lone pair of electrons.

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:16.000
And it happens when an orbital
or a linear combination of

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:21.000
orbitals finds no counterpart --

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:31.000
-- of like nodal symmetry.
These nodal properties of

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:36.000
orbitals are very important,
and I will show you later how

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:42.000
the nodal properties are related
to the energies of the orbitals,

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:46.000
as we consider them.
Having given you this preview

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:52.000
of how orbitals are going to be
able to combine in the MO

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:57.000
theory, let's see how it
actually takes place in the case

00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:00.000
of BH three.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:18.000
Now we are drawing another
example of an energy-level

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:23.000
diagram, where the energy is low
at the bottom and rises as it

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:26.000
goes up.
And these energy-level diagrams

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:30.000
that we are now developing for
molecules are analogous to those

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:35.000
that you studied earlier in the
semester for atoms.

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:41.000
And we are just generalizing
this notion to the atoms.

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:48.000
And what I am drawing over here
is our boron 2s orbital and here

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:52.000
is our boron 2px,
2py, 2pz orbital.

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:58.000
Those horizontal bars just
represent the energy of these

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:04.000
orbitals in the molecule.
Here I am just redrawing the

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:08.000
boron atom.
And then, over here on the

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:14.000
right, we are going to see that
we have our linear combinations

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:19.000
that we developed.
These are our three H 1s linear

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:22.000
combinations.
We found that the three

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:28.000
hydrogens in BH three
were symmetry equivalent,

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:33.000
so we generated linear
combinations.

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:38.000
The pictures of them are over
there.

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:45.000
I can give them names.
Why don't I call them D,

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:48.000
E, and F.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:05.000
We have D constructed to match
the nodal properties of the

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:09.000
boron's 2s orbital.
E and F were respectively

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:14.000
constructed to match the nodal
properties of the boron's 2s,

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:18.000
2px, and 2py orbitals.
And I am showing you their

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:22.000
relative energies.
And now we need to do this

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:26.000
issue referenced here as point
three.

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:30.000
We need to combine these
things.

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:33.000
I have these on the one hand
and these on the other.

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:38.000
Our seven atomic orbitals have
been changed into four atomic

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:40.000
orbitals and three linear
combinations,

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:43.000
so I still have seven orbitals
total.

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:47.000
And now I am going to combine
these with these according to

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:51.000
their nodal properties to
generate seven molecular

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:55.000
orbitals.
And let's do it this way.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:08.000
We are going to take linear
combination D that has been

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:13.000
constructed to match the boron
2s orbital in terms of nodal

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:18.000
symmetry properties,
and we are going to make a

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:22.000
bonding combination.
I am going to draw these

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:26.000
pictorially in a moment.
And, in this case,

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:32.000
those are the only two orbitals
in my seven orbital system here

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:38.000
that have that set of nodal
symmetry properties.

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:42.000
And for every bonding MO,
I must have an antibonding MO.

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:44.000
This is one of our molecular
orbitals.

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:49.000
And there is going to be a
corresponding molecular orbital

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:53.000
up here, high in energy.
And this will be an antibonding

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:57.000
molecular orbital that will be
the out-of-phase combination of

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:03.000
the boron 2s with this linear
combination that I labeled D.

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:09.000
Antibonding molecular orbitals
are usually denoted with a star.

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:15.000
We have a bonding combination
and an anti-bonding combination.

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:21.000
Now, we can form two more bonds
that will spread out over the

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:24.000
molecule because,
if you recall,

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:31.000
we had our px and py pair that
served as the nodal template for

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:37.000
our construction of linear
combinations E and F.

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:42.000
We are going to be able to
match up those to form two more

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:48.000
bonding molecular orbitals.
And these will be found to be

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:53.000
higher in energy than the first
one that we formed from D.

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:59.000
Here is a pair of bonding
molecular orbitals that derive

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:05.000
from linear combinations E and F
combining in-phase with boron's

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:10.000
px and py atomic orbitals.
And there will be a

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:14.000
corresponding antibonding
combination, where we allow

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:19.000
those orbitals to interact in an
out-of-phase manner.

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:22.000
And you will see what that
means shortly.

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:27.000
Let me put that up there and
add a star to indicate that this

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:32.000
high energy pair of molecular
orbitals is an antibonding pair

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:36.000
of orbitals.
I have six orbitals now in my

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:40.000
molecular orbital energy-level
diagram for BH three.

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:44.000
And that means I am not done
because I have to have seven,

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:47.000
and I started out with seven
atomic orbitals.

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:50.000
Look over here.
2pz was an atomic orbital on

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:55.000
boron that did not find any way
of serving as a template for

00:42:55.000 --> 00:43:00.000
making a linear combination
involving the three hydrogens.

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:05.000
And so, it comes over here as
nonbonding.

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:12.000
It has no counterpart of like
nodal symmetry because of the

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:18.000
location of those three
hydrogens in the x,y-plane,

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:25.000
which is a nodal plane for the
boron pz orbital.

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:32.000
And so, this one is nonbonding.
These three orbitals up here

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:35.000
are anti-bonding.
And the ones down at the

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:40.000
bottom, which are the lowest in
energy, corresponding to being

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:45.000
able to most tightly hold onto
electrons in them are bonding

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:49.000
molecular orbitals.
And so our electrons can fill

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:53.000
into this MO energy-level
diagram in that way.

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:59.000
We have our six electrons that
come into this problem.

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:03.000
We have boron bringing in three
valance electrons and three

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:07.000
hydrogens each bringing in one
valance electron.

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:10.000
There are six electrons to put
into the diagram,

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:14.000
filling up three of the
molecular orbitals and then

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:18.000
leaving empty pz.
Let me introduce a little bit

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:22.000
more MO language right now.
This one here will be called

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:27.000
the highest occupied molecular
orbital, and this one here will

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:32.000
be called the lowest unoccupied
molecular orbital.

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:37.000
The reason why I am drawing
attention to these orbitals is

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:41.000
that in chemistry,
the chemical properties derive

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:47.000
oftentimes from those orbitals
that are in what is called the

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:52.000
frontier orbital region.
And the frontier orbitals are

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:56.000
those close in energy to the
HOMO-LUMO gap.

00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:02.000
And I will come back to this.
But those highest energetically

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:05.000
lying electrons are going to be
the ones responsible for

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:10.000
nucleophilic properties of the
molecule and basic properties of

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:13.000
the molecule and reducing
properties of the molecule.

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:17.000
Whereas, low-lying empty
orbitals are going to be the

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:20.000
ones responsible for acidic
properties of the molecule or

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:23.000
oxidizing properties of the
molecule.

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:27.000
And we will come back to that
in a moment.

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:31.000
But that is something pretty
general and very useful that

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:36.000
comes out of studying molecular
orbital energy-level diagrams.

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:46.000
Now that we have the diagram,
let's see what the orbitals in

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:50.000
the diagram look like.
And I will try to do this

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:54.000
relatively quickly.
Here, let's start with the

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:59.000
lowest lying molecular orbital
in the system.

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:04.000
This is a representation of an
in-phase combination of the

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:09.000
boron 2s plus D,
where D is defined up here as

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:14.000
that linear combination.
This will be a molecular

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:19.000
orbital having the nodal
properties of a 2s orbital

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:25.000
centered on that central atom.
That is where our lowest-lying

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:31.000
two electrons reside.
Now, if you look at the LUMO

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:35.000
over there and then go up one
orbital in energy,

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:41.000
you will be looking at this
orbital, which is the boron 2s

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:43.000
orbital minus D.

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:54.000
And the thing that makes this
out-of-phase linear combination

00:46:54.000 --> 00:47:01.000
so much higher in energy than
its in-phase counterpart is the

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:06.000
appearance, now,
of a nodal surface.

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:08.000
And this node is between the
nuclei.

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:13.000
It goes all the way around and
is between the central atom s

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:16.000
orbital and those peripheral
hydrogens.

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:20.000
And I will show you a picture
of it.

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:42.000
This is our BH three
LUMO plus one molecular orbital.

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:56.000
You can see that we have a wave
function in the center of one

00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:58.000
sign.
And then, as we go along any

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:02.000
one of the B-H bond vectors from
boron to hydrogen,

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:06.000
we change phase midway along
the bond from positive to

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:09.000
negative.
And that is true,

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:14.000
no matter which of the three
B-H bonds we pick to traverse

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:17.000
along.
That one has the nodal

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:22.000
properties as drawn down there
for the boron 2s interacting in

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:28.000
an out-of-phase manner with
linear combination letter D.

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:32.000
And so, next time,
I will finish up and show you

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:36.000
what these other orbitals look
like as calculated.

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:41.000
I hope you have enjoyed this.
We will see more MO theory on

00:48:41.751 --> 00:48:44.000
Friday.

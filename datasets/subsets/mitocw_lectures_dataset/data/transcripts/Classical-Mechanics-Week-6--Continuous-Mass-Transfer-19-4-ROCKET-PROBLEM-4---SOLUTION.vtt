WEBVTT

00:00:03.382 --> 00:00:05.090
Now that we have all
the pieces in place,

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:07.460
we'd like to apply the momentum
principle to the rocket

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:08.310
problem.

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:10.490
Recall that the
momentum principle

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:14.360
is that the external
force on the rocket

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.510
causes-- on the system-- causes
the momentum of the system

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:18.690
to change.

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.460
And the fundamental
definition of a derivative

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.720
is to look at the change in
momentum between sometimes t

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:32.030
plus delta t-- our two states
that we've identified--

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:35.210
divided by delta t.

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:40.390
Now recall that we had
the momentum of the system

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.270
at time t was the mass
of the rocket times

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.730
d-bar of the rocket a t.

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:54.530
I'll just quickly show
mass of the rocket V-rt.

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:02.750
And we had the system
at time t plus delta t

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:08.660
where we had delta M-fuel equals
minus delta M-rocket Here we

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:15.680
had M-r plus delta M. And we
had the velocity in the ground

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:21.350
frame, which we saw
was equal to-- so let's

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:26.150
write out the momentum of the
system at time t plus delta t.

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.420
That was a little bit longer.

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:34.070
p system at t plus
delta t had two pieces.

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:42.050
It had M-r plus delta M-r
times V of r of t plus delta t.

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:46.670
And we were subtracting--
now, because we

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.270
made this change, that's
minus then delta M-r u

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.580
plus V-bar of t plus delta t.

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:00.590
And this, recall, was
the velocity of the fuel.

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.880
Now we're in position to
apply our momentum principle,

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.950
because we have expressions
for the momentum

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.150
of the system at
time t and at time t

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.160
and at time t plus delta t.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.980
So now this will be
a big expression.

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:23.120
So we'll write external force is
the limit as delta t goes to 0.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:30.230
Now here, our first term, is
of M of r plus delta M-r times

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:35.960
the velocity of the rocket
at time t plus delta t.

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:42.440
And now we have the fuel
term, minus delta M-r times u

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:48.020
plus V of r of t plus delta t.

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:49.400
And we have to
subtract from that

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.480
and I'll indicate that with
a slightly different color.

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.590
M-r V of r of t.

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:03.860
And the whole thing,
we're dividing by delta t.

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:05.810
Now let's look at
this expression

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.510
first because there is some
very nice simplifications.

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.260
The first thing we can see,
let's look at this term delta

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.010
M-r times V of r.

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.520
Notice we have minus
delta M-r V of r here.

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.790
So those two terms cancel.

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.430
And we're just left
with three other terms

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.360
and let's write them out.

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:29.210
So now we have the limit
as delta t goes to 0.

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:31.920
And I'm going to combine
terms in the following way.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:38.750
M-r times V of r
of t plus delta t.

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.630
And over here, I have
M-r minus V of r.

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:50.090
So I have a minus V of r
of t divided by delta t.

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.520
And now I have one
more term here.

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:58.160
And I'm going to write this as
minus the limit as delta t goes

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:02.120
to 0 of delta M-r over delta t.

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:03.440
Remember, this term cancelled.

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:09.890
We only have u, the speed of
the fuel relative to the rocket.

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:14.030
And in both cases--
this is our first term

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:15.450
and here's our second term.

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:17.260
Let's look at these limits.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:18.950
Notice in here,
we're just taking

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:23.930
V of r of t plus delta t minus
V of r-t divided by delta t.

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:27.650
And that's precisely the
definition of the derivative

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:29.540
of the velocity of the rocket.

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:32.030
So this first term,
our expression

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:36.620
becomes the external
force is equal to the mass

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:40.820
of our system times V
of r, the derivative

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:43.100
of the velocity of the rocket.

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:45.800
And the second term,
this is the rate

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.180
that the fuel is
changing in the rocket.

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:53.010
This is rather the rate that the
mass of the rocket is changing.

00:04:53.010 --> 00:05:00.350
So that's the derivative dM-r
dt times the relative velocity

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:02.540
of the fuel with
respect to the rocket.

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:08.710
So this equation here--
I'll box it off--

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:14.810
is called the rocket
equation, which

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:17.100
we've derived from
the momentum principle

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:19.580
using our momentum diagrams.

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:23.030
And you can see that this
is what people refer to

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:25.660
as rocket science.

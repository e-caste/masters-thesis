00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.192
PROFESSOR: While people
trickle in--

00:00:29.192 --> 00:00:33.160
This slide is my attempt to
summarize what we said last

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.850
time, or you said last
time, mostly.

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:42.500
So it's basically, the movie
is making a case for

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:43.740
microfinance.

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:47.380
And the case is all these
different points.

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:53.110
They're building a case for
a particular version of

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:54.420
microfinance.

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.340
And they're making this
set of points.

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:59.490
They start with the point
that poor have

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:00.635
poor access to credit.

00:01:00.635 --> 00:01:03.690
That they're reliable
borrowers.

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.850
That maybe group lending has
something to do with the

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:09.200
reliability.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:14.910
That microfinance can lift
people out of poverty.

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:17.375
The way it does it is through
new businesses.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.960
And the fact that this is these
new business generate

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.220
increased earnings of women.

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:34.260
Has the implication that there
is then greater investment in

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:35.510
human capital.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.720
And finally, there is a implied
but also, I think,

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:50.640
important claim that there's
no conflict between the

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.600
commercialization of microcredit
and an emphasis on

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:56.810
its social role.

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.460
So those are the claims
being made.

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.720
So what I want to do today is
mostly go through the thinking

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.789
behind what's the argument
behind each of these.

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.330
And then try to look
at the data a bit.

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.050
So I'm going to now tell you a
little bit about an evaluation

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:23.420
we did of a program, of an
organization called Spandana.

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:24.890
It's a very traditional
program.

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.020
Their group liability, mostly
weekly payment.

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:32.240
Starting loan is about
10,000 rupees.

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.820
Interest rate was about 12%,
24% per year, really.

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:38.290
The way they calculate
is funny.

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.240
So it's 24% per year.

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.980
It was a very large MFI already,
but it had not

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:46.330
entered the city called
Hyderabad.

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:53.960
So the deal we had with them
was, they were going to enter

00:02:53.960 --> 00:03:01.670
the city of Hyderabad,
but not everywhere.

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:06.770
Out of 104 poor neighborhoods
we selected,

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:08.750
they could enter 52.

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.310
And they'll keep the other 52
for 18 months untouched.

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.330
That was the deal.

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:16.825
So that's the Spandana group.

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:27.240
So this data is from 7,200
people who we surveyed.

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.350
7,200 households.

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:34.910
These households were selected
based on the fact that they

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:36.360
will be eligible for a loan.

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.500
It's not interesting
to compare people--

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.020
you could have also have
done something else.

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:43.970
But it makes sense
to select people.

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.380
Now, we didn't select them just
in the places which got

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:48.330
microcredit.

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.350
Because we wanted to compare
the places which got

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:51.590
microcredit and which didn't.

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:54.300
So we had equal numbers
of people.

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:59.370
3,600 people with these
characteristics where they got

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.210
the loan, and 3,600 with these
characteristics who

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:04.390
didn't get the loan.

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:08.030
Basic idea is to compare people
who could have got a

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:11.110
loan if there had been a
microfinance organization in

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:13.930
their neighborhood with people
who did get a loan.

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:20.920
These people are relatively
poor.

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:25.290
They have about a family
of five monthly

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:32.688
expenditure of $125.

00:04:32.688 --> 00:04:36.790
Most of their children are
going to school, though.

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:38.570
They do borrow.

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:40.080
Many of them have loans.

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.490
When they borrow, 69% of the
households have loans.

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:46.480
But a lot of the households
that have loans from

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:50.830
moneylenders pay about
4% per month.

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:56.050
So Spandana charges 24% percent
per year, which is

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:57.610
less than 2% a month.

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:59.600
Because that's simple
interest.

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:05.520
2% a month simple interest,
which is substantially less

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.610
than half of that.

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:09.460
There's no MFI borrowing
at the beginning.

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:16.480
Lots of them run businesses,
31%.

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:17.640
That's a number to note.

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:20.030
Because you take the rich
country average.

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:25.590
The rich country average
is something like 12%.

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:29.700
9% run more than one business.

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:32.510
But these businesses are
extremely basic.

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:35.590
Like, I have a shop.

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:38.640
In the shop, I have bottles.

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:44.210
In the big bottles with
cookies, matchboxes,

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:48.370
cigarettes, and candy in them.

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:49.790
That's my shop.

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:51.480
I sell that.

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:57.330
Or I have a little push cart and
I sell vegetables on it.

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:59.860
So these businesses and not high
skilled, they have very

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:02.600
little capital, and they
have no employees.

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:07.990
Their profits are about $75
a month, so very small

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:10.420
businesses.

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:11.670
Like those.

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:16.220
When we asked them in the
beginning, why do you want to

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:17.330
get a loan?

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:20.150
A lot of them said what you
had already anticipated.

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:23.450
You might want to get a loan,
not just to start a business,

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:27.020
but also to repay a loan.

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:28.870
To do something for
your household.

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:35.100
To buy a fridge or a TV.

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:37.280
So they were quite candid
about the fact that they

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:40.480
didn't necessarily want
to start a business.

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:47.390
So, skip that.

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:50.810
So before we get into the
results, it's worth thinking a

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:53.580
little bit about what we
should expect to see.

00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:02.670
And in particular, should we
expect people on average to be

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:05.010
consuming more when
they get a lot?

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:12.890
Yes, no?

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:19.040
Answers, answers.

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:19.980
There, yes.

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:21.070
Go ahead, explain.

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:24.500
AUDIENCE: If they intend to
start businesses [INAUDIBLE],

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:27.930
then you might expect that
they would tighten their

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:31.050
belts, or consumption in the
first two weeks of running it.

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:33.771
Therefore, their consumption
would go down.

00:07:33.771 --> 00:07:35.027
PROFESSOR: You might think their
consumption would go

00:07:35.027 --> 00:07:37.970
down as a result of starting a
business, because right now

00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:39.290
I'm starting a business.

00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:41.840
I don't want to start it on the
smallest possible scale.

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:44.160
I might want to buy
some inputs for my

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:45.780
business, expand it.

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:48.790
So when I start a business, I
might actually want to cut

00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:53.550
back on consumption for a while
before I go back to.

00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:55.130
Over time, it should
go back up.

00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:57.600
But at the beginning, I might
very well see a fall in

00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:58.240
consumption.

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:02.470
So that's an important thing
to keep in mind.

00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:07.470
That if people are starting
businesses, they may

00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:08.690
actually cut back.

00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:12.290
So you may not see a
big net increase.

00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:13.340
You'll see an increase.

00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:15.930
If they start the business and
business is successful, then

00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:17.900
two years later you'll
see an increase.

00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:19.150
But not right away.

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:24.600
So here's the first problem we
had in this evaluation, which

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:27.540
is that despite the fact that
Spandana said they would not

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:31.390
enter these neighborhoods that
were put into control, the

00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:32.559
loan officers did.

00:08:32.559 --> 00:08:32.890
Why?

00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:36.330
Because they thought, well,
that looks like a nice

00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:36.680
neighborhood.

00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:39.720
We could lend more to people
and make more money.

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:40.960
So they went in.

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:44.720
And we had to kind of fight
a lot to stop them.

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:49.700
And so in the end, the
difference in Spandana loans

00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:52.490
was only 13%.

00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:54.490
It should have been bigger.

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:01.290
Now, because that happens--

00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:04.325
so some of the control
neighborhoods got the loans--

00:09:07.366 --> 00:09:11.702
we're not going to be using the
actual fact of who got a

00:09:11.702 --> 00:09:15.440
loan and who didn't
get a loan.

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:18.970
We're going to use the
intention to treat.

00:09:18.970 --> 00:09:22.320
We'll compare places that we
thought should not have a loan

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:25.210
with places which we thought
should have a loan.

00:09:25.210 --> 00:09:27.980
That's something that is
determined by randomizing.

00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:30.055
Whereas who actually got
a loan was not random.

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.480
When the people went into
control neighborhoods, they

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:39.110
went into the best, in the
most attractive ones.

00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:40.090
So we can't do that.

00:09:40.090 --> 00:09:45.060
We need to compare ones which
actually got the loan.

00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:49.670
And even worse than that, where
Spandana didn't go,

00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:51.520
other MFIs went.

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:53.570
Because they wanted to
fill up the market.

00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:56.085
So this difference is small.

00:09:56.085 --> 00:09:57.880
So when you see--

00:09:57.880 --> 00:09:58.910
why is that relevant?

00:09:58.910 --> 00:10:01.180
Well, when you see the
difference, I'm going to show

00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:06.320
you the average difference
between places that were

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:10.840
intended to get microfinance
with places that were not

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:13.070
intended to get microfinance.

00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:16.020
Notice that that difference
is only 8%.

00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:19.290
The places that were intended to
get microfinance were only

00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:20.060
8% percent.

00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:23.700
People there are only 8% more
likely to have a loan than

00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:29.350
places that were intended
not to get microfinance.

00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:35.980
So when I look at the average
of those places, what will

00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:37.475
happen to the magnitude
of the effect?

00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:41.570
It will be very small.

00:10:41.570 --> 00:10:44.640
Because only 8% difference--

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:48.210
in either, both places, a
lot of people got loans.

00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:50.030
So the difference was small.

00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:53.420
So to get the real sense of the
magnitude of the effect, I

00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:55.100
need to multiply by--

00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:59.150
since it's 8% of the people
generated this difference, to

00:10:59.150 --> 00:11:03.830
get the full effect of this,
what should I do?

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:06.860
To get a sense of the
magnitude, what

00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:09.240
would I need to do?

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:16.761
If 8% generated an effect of 5,
what would the effect have

00:11:16.761 --> 00:11:22.725
been if the difference
was 100%?

00:11:22.725 --> 00:11:26.220
AUDIENCE: You multiply
by 100, divide by 8.

00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:28.630
PROFESSOR: You'd multiply
by 100, divide by 12.

00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:31.227
You would multiply by 12.

00:11:31.227 --> 00:11:34.054
AUDIENCE: Isn't it the case that
you could look up what is

00:11:34.054 --> 00:11:35.219
the average--

00:11:35.219 --> 00:11:38.213
if there is no microfinance,
then it's 100% of the people

00:11:38.213 --> 00:11:40.708
that [INAUDIBLE].

00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:45.290
PROFESSOR: So you'll
do something that.

00:11:45.290 --> 00:11:47.502
So when you look at the numbers,
they look small.

00:11:47.502 --> 00:11:49.440
But you have to realize
that that's a

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:52.390
difference generated by--

00:11:52.390 --> 00:11:55.530
the difference is generated
by a very small

00:11:55.530 --> 00:11:57.120
difference in take up.

00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:00.280
So these results are look much
smaller than they really are.

00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:08.360
So here's what happened
in the business space.

00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:15.210
There was some increase in
new businesses, which was

00:12:15.210 --> 00:12:16.570
significant.

00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:19.140
Some increase in profits, which
was not significant.

00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:22.870
Some increase in revenues, which
was not significant.

00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:28.040
But the new businesses
was significant.

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:29.780
So think of it this way.

00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:31.830
This is the number of
businesses set up

00:12:31.830 --> 00:12:33.450
in 1 and 1/2 years.

00:12:33.450 --> 00:12:36.850
So basically, 31% already
had a business.

00:12:36.850 --> 00:12:40.020
Another 7% set up businesses
in the treatment.

00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:42.910
And 5.3% set up business
in the control.

00:12:42.910 --> 00:12:48.770
So that's a 30% increase in the
number of new businesses.

00:12:48.770 --> 00:12:50.290
So it's not small.

00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:53.070
It looks small numbers,
but it's in fact

00:12:53.070 --> 00:12:56.940
a significant increase.

00:12:56.940 --> 00:13:00.430
In any case, people don't start
that many new business.

00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:02.920
So is there was some effect.

00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:07.010
Consumption.

00:13:07.010 --> 00:13:11.610
Blue is always control,
yellow is treatment.

00:13:11.610 --> 00:13:14.510
So consumption didn't really
go up significantly.

00:13:14.510 --> 00:13:17.320
But we discussed why
that might happen.

00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:20.020
You do see more durable
purchases, more business

00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:20.950
durable purchases.

00:13:20.950 --> 00:13:22.470
And I won't say what temptation

00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:24.070
goods are right now.

00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:26.300
So less temptation goods.

00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:29.930
But you do see more business.

00:13:29.930 --> 00:13:32.160
Here's what didn't happen.

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:35.500
Despite the gender nature
of spending,

00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:37.490
apparently nothing changed.

00:13:37.490 --> 00:13:41.230
So schooling is hard
to change, because

00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:42.550
everybody goes to school.

00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:44.480
So let's say that's difficult
to change.

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:47.054
But nothing else
changed either.

00:13:47.054 --> 00:13:50.150
Children were just
as unhealthy.

00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:54.220
Women were no more likely to
have decision power on

00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:56.110
spending in the household.

00:13:56.110 --> 00:13:58.690
And health expenditures
didn't go up.

00:13:58.690 --> 00:14:01.850
So if you think that women spend
differently, we didn't

00:14:01.850 --> 00:14:03.460
find any evidence of it.

00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:09.120
So the gender effect that we had
discussed doesn't seem to

00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:11.620
be in this data.

00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:13.360
The next thing we did
is go back to that

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:14.350
story we were telling.

00:14:14.350 --> 00:14:17.110
Me were telling a story where
some people would invest,

00:14:17.110 --> 00:14:19.370
start a new business, and they
would cut their consumption.

00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:23.600
Others will not start
their business.

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:26.820
And now they have no reason
to cut their consumption.

00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:30.320
So imagine that the two kinds of
people, one kind of people

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:31.910
are going to start a
new business and

00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:34.690
the other kind wont.

00:14:34.690 --> 00:14:37.110
So what we want to do is we
want to predict who those

00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:38.360
people are.

00:14:44.145 --> 00:14:48.600
If we went to the treatment
areas and we looked at who

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:49.980
started a new business.

00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:52.720
And we went to the control
area and we looked at who

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:55.250
started a new business, and we
compared them, would that be a

00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:56.500
valid comparison?

00:15:09.154 --> 00:15:11.120
Let me repeat the question.

00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:15.020
Suppose I went to the
treatment areas--

00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:16.352
the treatment area and
the control area

00:15:16.352 --> 00:15:18.050
were randomly chosen.

00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:21.800
I went to the treatment areas,
I found people there who had

00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:23.380
started a business.

00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:26.140
I went to the control areas,
and I found people who had

00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:28.930
already newly started
a business.

00:15:28.930 --> 00:15:30.110
And I compared them.

00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:31.485
Would that be a valid
comparison?

00:15:35.366 --> 00:15:37.358
AUDIENCE: May I ask
a question?

00:15:37.358 --> 00:15:39.848
In the first example, when you
went to the treatment areas

00:15:39.848 --> 00:15:42.587
did you study the people newly
started a business, or people

00:15:42.587 --> 00:15:43.350
that had a business?

00:15:43.350 --> 00:15:45.710
PROFESSOR: So when I say newly
started a business, these are

00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:49.585
people who started a business in
the 18 months when we were

00:15:49.585 --> 00:15:50.850
observing these areas.

00:15:50.850 --> 00:15:53.300
AUDIENCE: No, it wouldn't
be valid [INAUDIBLE].

00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:53.790
PROFESSOR: Why?

00:15:53.790 --> 00:15:55.260
AUDIENCE: And the reason why
is because, while you are

00:15:55.260 --> 00:16:00.650
comparing new businesses
started, in the treatment

00:16:00.650 --> 00:16:04.325
area, without more precise
information, it's hard to

00:16:04.325 --> 00:16:07.510
understand who started the
business due to the fact that

00:16:07.510 --> 00:16:11.070
they got the loan versus just
due to the fact that they were

00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:12.040
starting it anyway.

00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:14.955
And yeah, you could compare
a control area.

00:16:14.955 --> 00:16:17.137
But even your control versus
your treatment area, it's not

00:16:17.137 --> 00:16:18.672
necessarily indicative that
they had the same sort of

00:16:18.672 --> 00:16:20.290
basis, [INAUDIBLE]

00:16:20.290 --> 00:16:23.530
difference or differences of the
treatment area before and

00:16:23.530 --> 00:16:25.390
after they got the loans.

00:16:25.390 --> 00:16:28.190
PROFESSOR: You were
nodding your head.

00:16:28.190 --> 00:16:30.452
Do you have a different
answer than that?

00:16:30.452 --> 00:16:32.210
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:32.210 --> 00:16:37.580
PROFESSOR: So basically, I think
that's not quite right.

00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:38.850
I think you don't ever
want to do it.

00:16:38.850 --> 00:16:41.070
The reason you never
want to do it is

00:16:41.070 --> 00:16:43.640
because you don't actually--

00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:47.500
think of people who start a
business when I can't offer

00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:49.210
them a loan.

00:16:49.210 --> 00:16:53.080
Versus people who start a
business when no loans were

00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:56.100
available or less loans
were available.

00:16:56.100 --> 00:16:58.410
They're different
kinds of people.

00:16:58.410 --> 00:17:01.800
When a loan is easy to get,
I might start a business.

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:04.040
But if loans are difficult
to get, I'm lazy, I

00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:05.310
won't start a business.

00:17:05.310 --> 00:17:07.819
Whereas somebody who starts a
loan when loans are not easily

00:17:07.819 --> 00:17:10.270
available is probably
much more committed

00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:11.440
to starting a business.

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:13.339
Is much one incentivized.

00:17:13.339 --> 00:17:15.020
So you don't want
to compare them.

00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:19.180
So what we had to do, we had to
think of what could predict

00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:20.700
who would start a business?

00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:22.599
Then what we could do
is we could split--

00:17:22.599 --> 00:17:27.329
we could look for the kind of
people would start a business

00:17:27.329 --> 00:17:28.359
in treatment.

00:17:28.359 --> 00:17:30.950
And look for the same kind
of people in control.

00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:34.215
So we could have a predictive
model of who

00:17:34.215 --> 00:17:35.190
would start a business.

00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:38.100
We could compare the things that
predict whether you start

00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:40.000
a business or not.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.950
So we want to divide the
population based on fixed

00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:44.490
characteristics.

00:17:44.490 --> 00:17:47.030
And the fixed characteristic
that worked very well is, if

00:17:47.030 --> 00:17:51.510
you own land and if you have a,
typically a wife, a woman

00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:55.520
in the household who is literate
and doesn't work.

00:17:55.520 --> 00:18:01.330
So if you have some assets,
there's a woman in the

00:18:01.330 --> 00:18:03.670
household who is currently
not working.

00:18:03.670 --> 00:18:06.400
But she has skills, skills
she's literate.

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:07.960
She's actually a
prime candidate

00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:09.110
for starting a business.

00:18:09.110 --> 00:18:12.780
So it turns out that if you look
for families with these

00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:15.160
characteristics in treatment and
control, there were equal

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:17.560
numbers of families in treatment
and control.

00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:18.590
Not accidentally.

00:18:18.590 --> 00:18:19.550
That's how you'd expect.

00:18:19.550 --> 00:18:21.140
You'd expect randomly chosen.

00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:22.710
So they are about the same.

00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:27.270
So you take these kinds of
families, which are available

00:18:27.270 --> 00:18:28.520
in treatment and control.

00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:30.173
They're identical-- yeah.

00:18:30.173 --> 00:18:31.159
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:31.159 --> 00:18:32.409
instrumental variable?

00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:36.340
PROFESSOR: This is not an
instrumental variable.

00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:40.330
It's just predicting who are
going to start a business.

00:18:40.330 --> 00:18:42.350
Then what I'm going to do
is I'm going to create--

00:18:45.030 --> 00:18:47.000
this is like baseline
characteristics.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.450
They're just different people.

00:18:48.450 --> 00:18:50.330
I can estimate the treatment
effect for

00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:52.130
any subset of people.

00:18:52.130 --> 00:18:55.560
I could say what's the effect
on tall people?

00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:59.140
This is just take a subset of
the population who are with

00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:03.450
these characteristics that
predict a business.

00:19:03.450 --> 00:19:06.580
Those people's consumption, does
it do behave differently

00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:08.260
from the consumption
of everyone else?

00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:10.010
That's the question
I'm asking.

00:19:10.010 --> 00:19:12.910
If these are people whose
characteristics predict that

00:19:12.910 --> 00:19:16.070
they will start a business, do
they behave differently from

00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:18.690
everybody else whose
characteristics predict that

00:19:18.690 --> 00:19:20.050
they won't start a business?

00:19:20.050 --> 00:19:21.860
So there are three groups
I'm going to look at.

00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:24.770
People who's characteristics
predict they will start a

00:19:24.770 --> 00:19:28.390
business, people who already
have a business, and people

00:19:28.390 --> 00:19:31.680
neither have a business nor
will start a business.

00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:32.850
So that's what I'm trying to.

00:19:32.850 --> 00:19:37.370
And if you do it, you do
see the difference.

00:19:37.370 --> 00:19:42.000
In the treatment, the people who
are who we predict should

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.130
start a business are much more
likely to start a business.

00:19:45.130 --> 00:19:47.380
The people who predict shouldn't
start a businesses

00:19:47.380 --> 00:19:49.900
are actually slightly less
likely to start a business.

00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:51.794
So that's sort of what
you'd expect.

00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:59.410
And now you start to see much
bigger differences.

00:19:59.410 --> 00:20:02.920
So the people who start a
business and people who

00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:07.450
already had a business, expand
their businesses.

00:20:07.450 --> 00:20:11.060
Or they buy durables.

00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:13.960
The people who didn't have a
business and don't are not

00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:16.180
planning a business-- so
durables can include, for

00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:19.520
example, business assets.

00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:20.900
They can repair the house
where they're

00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:22.140
going to have a shop.

00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:23.890
So all those things
are durable.

00:20:23.890 --> 00:20:27.280
So they seem to do stuff
that could be

00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:29.280
related to the business.

00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:31.690
The people who we predict should
not start a business,

00:20:31.690 --> 00:20:32.890
don't start a business.

00:20:32.890 --> 00:20:35.170
And they don't make any
durable expenditures.

00:20:35.170 --> 00:20:41.600
They increase non durable
expenditures a lot.

00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:46.110
So the bottom group increases
non durable expenditures.

00:20:46.110 --> 00:20:51.430
That's like spending on food,
and things like that.

00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:54.270
The middle group, basically
nothing changes.

00:20:54.270 --> 00:20:57.400
And the top group cuts
non durables.

00:20:57.400 --> 00:20:59.130
They're eating less.

00:20:59.130 --> 00:21:01.210
These people are spending
less on food,

00:21:01.210 --> 00:21:03.040
they're buying more durables.

00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:06.250
The durables are what they
want for the future.

00:21:06.250 --> 00:21:08.710
So they seem to be behaving
in very different ways.

00:21:14.570 --> 00:21:17.510
So finally, this thing
of temptation goods.

00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:18.880
What are temptation goods?

00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:20.000
Well we asked people.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:24.560
This is a beetle leaf cellar.

00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:28.790
So people in South Asia and
Southeast Asia chew these

00:21:28.790 --> 00:21:31.460
leaves and these nuts, which
are called beetle nuts and

00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:32.950
beetle leaves.

00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:35.960
They have slightly narcotic
effects, mild narcotic

00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:40.000
effects, and a lot of
people chew them.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.910
And this guy's a vendor.

00:21:42.910 --> 00:21:44.730
He's a small business owner.

00:21:44.730 --> 00:21:51.400
So we asked people in the
baseline to tell us, what are

00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:54.110
things you want to give
up on spending?

00:21:57.010 --> 00:22:00.500
So we asked them to give us a
list of things they said they

00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:02.570
want to give up.

00:22:02.570 --> 00:22:04.850
And that was basically
very simple.

00:22:04.850 --> 00:22:12.180
They want to give up on tea,
coffee, snacks, beetle nuts,

00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:15.130
cigarettes, and alcohol.

00:22:15.130 --> 00:22:16.460
That's all they wanted to.

00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:19.310
These were the things they
wanted to give up.

00:22:19.310 --> 00:22:21.590
Now we go back two
years later, and

00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:22.760
we look at the data.

00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:26.000
And we classify spending
on these things

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:26.910
versus everything else.

00:22:26.910 --> 00:22:28.790
These things we called
"temptation," because they're

00:22:28.790 --> 00:22:30.910
things that they say they don't
want to do, but they end

00:22:30.910 --> 00:22:33.140
up spending on.

00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:36.150
And what you see quite
dramatically is that that's

00:22:36.150 --> 00:22:38.700
where you see a big
difference.

00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:43.790
The people who are starting a
business cut back massively in

00:22:43.790 --> 00:22:47.730
their spending on temptation
goods.

00:22:47.730 --> 00:22:54.410
The people who will never start
a business seem to be

00:22:54.410 --> 00:22:55.480
having a party.

00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:59.160
They go out and they start
spending more on those things.

00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:02.740
So basically what's going on
for many of these people is

00:23:02.740 --> 00:23:06.000
they're turning their temptation
expenditures,

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:09.890
they're using that money to
pay the loan payment.

00:23:09.890 --> 00:23:13.150
And then with the money, they're
buying something else.

00:23:13.150 --> 00:23:16.540
So when they get the money, they
either buy a durable or a

00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:17.490
business durable.

00:23:17.490 --> 00:23:22.620
They expand their consumption,
their durable ownership, and

00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:24.610
then they pay down by
cutting back on

00:23:24.610 --> 00:23:26.570
their temptation goods.

00:23:26.570 --> 00:23:29.540
So they're drinking less tea and
they're owning more TVs,

00:23:29.540 --> 00:23:30.300
if you like.

00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:31.055
Yeah.

00:23:31.055 --> 00:23:32.305
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:40.280
less on temptation goods than
those who were taking loans?

00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:41.860
PROFESSOR: Because these people

00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:43.350
are starting a business.

00:23:43.350 --> 00:23:44.430
They need the money.

00:23:44.430 --> 00:23:47.748
AUDIENCE: No, but in the control
group also they are

00:23:47.748 --> 00:23:50.120
starting new businesses?

00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:50.840
PROFESSOR: No, they're
much less likely.

00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:53.340
Remember, these people
have high

00:23:53.340 --> 00:23:55.080
propensity to start a business.

00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:58.230
Nevertheless, in control,
they're much less likely to.

00:23:58.230 --> 00:24:01.130
They're only half as likely to
start a business in control as

00:24:01.130 --> 00:24:03.790
in treatment.

00:24:03.790 --> 00:24:07.940
So these people are much more
likely to be people who

00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:09.215
started businesses
in treatment.

00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:17.820
OK, so that's sort of the--

00:24:17.820 --> 00:24:21.000
now, this is a story
which is--

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:22.700
it depends on the--

00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:25.770
So when we published these
results, the reaction from

00:24:25.770 --> 00:24:30.275
microfinance industry was
very negative, largely.

00:24:30.275 --> 00:24:32.220
They thought these results
were showing

00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:33.560
that they had failed.

00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:36.720
And it really went ballistic.

00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:40.860
There was lots and lots of blogs
which explained how we

00:24:40.860 --> 00:24:43.560
don't understand how to
analyze microcredit.

00:24:48.270 --> 00:24:53.640
On the World Bank's website
there where dismissive

00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:55.280
statements, and all that.

00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:58.670
So there were lots of these
things basically claiming that

00:24:58.670 --> 00:25:02.530
microcredit is too subtle
to be analyzed by us.

00:25:02.530 --> 00:25:04.960
So why was the reaction?

00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:07.960
We actually didn't think this
was so negative, in fact.

00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:09.750
We thought this was fine.

00:25:09.750 --> 00:25:10.930
New businesses went up.

00:25:10.930 --> 00:25:14.230
The people we thought would do
better were doing better.

00:25:14.230 --> 00:25:15.540
Some people were doing worse.

00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:17.620
That's normal.

00:25:17.620 --> 00:25:19.600
If you give people a loan,
not everybody is

00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:20.830
going to use it well.

00:25:20.830 --> 00:25:23.190
Some people are going to use it
in ways that will get them

00:25:23.190 --> 00:25:23.970
into trouble.

00:25:23.970 --> 00:25:26.890
Others are going to use
it very well and

00:25:26.890 --> 00:25:27.720
do well out of it.

00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:30.210
And you're always creating
some risk when you create

00:25:30.210 --> 00:25:32.210
financial products.

00:25:32.210 --> 00:25:36.470
But people really hated these
results, and so we

00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:37.830
got some push back.

00:25:37.830 --> 00:25:42.840
[INAUDIBLE] went away
for a sad way.

00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:45.780
What happened next was
that-- so this was

00:25:45.780 --> 00:25:49.040
going on through 2009.

00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:52.900
When the results came out, there
was lots of push back.

00:25:52.900 --> 00:25:55.490
And then side-by-side
with that, something

00:25:55.490 --> 00:25:56.470
else started happening.

00:25:56.470 --> 00:25:57.720
And that's sort of
unfortunate.

00:26:00.250 --> 00:26:08.110
So the next thing that happened
was that in 2009--

00:26:08.110 --> 00:26:13.200
I guess both in 2009, once
in an organization called

00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:20.322
Compartamos in Mexico
had an IPO.

00:26:20.322 --> 00:26:24.680
You know what an IPO is?

00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:26.540
An initial public offering.

00:26:26.540 --> 00:26:28.530
They sold their stock.

00:26:28.530 --> 00:26:32.060
And they made a ton of money.

00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:35.420
And an organization called SKS
in India, which we actually

00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:40.140
worked with on something else,
not microcredit, then went

00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:44.920
ahead and they had
another IPO.

00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:48.780
These IPOs raised a lot of
money, like hundreds of

00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:50.660
millions of dollars.

00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:56.190
And the reaction to that was
correctly, this means these

00:26:56.190 --> 00:26:57.645
organizations are
very profitable.

00:27:01.070 --> 00:27:03.720
Suddenly, everybody got
upset with them.

00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:06.715
Because they realized that if
these companies can be sold

00:27:06.715 --> 00:27:11.840
for $300 million, then they must
be making a lot of money.

00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:13.920
Now that's a bit unfair.

00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:16.750
Because they were making a lot
of money, but they also had

00:27:16.750 --> 00:27:18.400
lots of clients.

00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:21.500
And if you have three million
clients, then making $300

00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:26.610
million over the next 20 years,
or something, is not so

00:27:26.610 --> 00:27:28.500
much after all.

00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:30.490
It's not that much money.

00:27:30.490 --> 00:27:35.310
If you think, I have 3 million
clients, I'm making $300

00:27:35.310 --> 00:27:41.840
million, that's $100 per client
over the next, let's

00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:42.860
say, ten years.

00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:48.740
So that's $10 per year per
client, which is not nearly as

00:27:48.740 --> 00:27:52.320
profitable as it sounds when
you say it's $300 million.

00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:53.860
Because these are big
organizations,

00:27:53.860 --> 00:27:55.240
many of them are.

00:27:55.240 --> 00:28:00.590
So in any case, that got them
into lots of trouble.

00:28:00.590 --> 00:28:03.000
So first thing that happened was
that a lot of microfinance

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.950
people started getting
very upset.

00:28:05.950 --> 00:28:08.340
Mohammad Yunus, who
started Grameen

00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:10.800
Bank, was really vehement.

00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:13.280
He called them the
new userers.

00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:19.750
And basically said that this
commercialization of

00:28:19.750 --> 00:28:23.310
microfinance goes against the
spirit of microfinance.

00:28:23.310 --> 00:28:24.650
So that was already trouble.

00:28:24.650 --> 00:28:28.410
Because there was divide
in the community.

00:28:28.410 --> 00:28:32.730
What happened after
that was even--

00:28:32.730 --> 00:28:33.980
so they said.

00:28:37.250 --> 00:28:38.050
We have a minute.

00:28:38.050 --> 00:28:44.700
So they said what we're trying
to do, we're doing an IPO

00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:46.710
because this is the best
way to raise capital.

00:28:46.710 --> 00:28:51.760
When we raise capital, we have a
lot of equity, we can now go

00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:54.610
and borrow a lot based on
our equity, and then

00:28:54.610 --> 00:28:56.020
we can expand lending.

00:28:56.020 --> 00:29:00.050
So instead of 10 million
people, 100 million

00:29:00.050 --> 00:29:01.990
people can get loans.

00:29:01.990 --> 00:29:05.120
So they were making the case,
like in the movie, that we

00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:07.150
really need to go in
this direction.

00:29:07.150 --> 00:29:10.150
So this was a fight going on.

00:29:10.150 --> 00:29:12.900
Then what happened,
this goes into the

00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:16.120
beginning of 2010 now.

00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:20.250
So there is two fights going
on through 2009.

00:29:20.250 --> 00:29:22.360
One is basically against us.

00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:27.380
And another set of results by
Dean [INAUDIBLE], who's at

00:29:27.380 --> 00:29:31.460
Yale, also showing small
positive results.

00:29:31.460 --> 00:29:34.250
But microfinance companies
didn't like the small positive

00:29:34.250 --> 00:29:39.430
results and they didn't
like these IPOs.

00:29:39.430 --> 00:29:44.090
Then what happened is
that a number of

00:29:44.090 --> 00:29:46.030
people committed suicide.

00:29:49.580 --> 00:29:57.340
A number of people in India, in
one state of India, which

00:29:57.340 --> 00:30:01.860
is called Andhra Pradesh,
committed suicide.

00:30:01.860 --> 00:30:04.830
Some of them claiming that it
is because their loan burden

00:30:04.830 --> 00:30:05.710
was too high.

00:30:05.710 --> 00:30:08.740
It turned out that they had
borrowed from six or seven

00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:10.620
different microfinance
organizations.

00:30:10.620 --> 00:30:13.630
And they couldn't repay, and
they committed suicide.

00:30:13.630 --> 00:30:19.800
And at that point, all these
forces kind of lined up in

00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:23.130
exactly the worst possible
way for the industry.

00:30:23.130 --> 00:30:25.240
First, there were these
suicides, second there was a

00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:27.820
fight within the industry, and
third there were these results

00:30:27.820 --> 00:30:31.470
showing that they hadn't done
something so great.

00:30:31.470 --> 00:30:33.890
And the net result was that
there was an attempt to

00:30:33.890 --> 00:30:38.630
basically, there was a political
attempt, to shut

00:30:38.630 --> 00:30:39.910
down microcredit.

00:30:39.910 --> 00:30:42.100
And that's still continuing,
in the sense.

00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:45.390
And what I want to end
on is showing you a

00:30:45.390 --> 00:30:50.170
video, which is--

00:30:50.170 --> 00:30:54.200
so BBC, as you saw a video that
was very pro microcredit.

00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:59.570
I want to show you a video
that's more recent and much

00:30:59.570 --> 00:31:00.610
less pro microcredit.

00:31:00.610 --> 00:31:01.860
Where is it?

00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:13.570
So you can see that you can
have unfair views on

00:31:13.570 --> 00:31:15.600
any side you want.

00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:22.370
You can make, that's a hatchet
job, if you've ever seen one.

00:31:22.370 --> 00:31:25.070
So main point being that
I think that--

00:31:25.070 --> 00:31:27.420
I only want to end on
this one point.

00:31:27.420 --> 00:31:31.070
Which is that if you look at
this study, it does exactly

00:31:31.070 --> 00:31:35.750
almost the same job
of very similar.

00:31:35.750 --> 00:31:36.370
The [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:36.370 --> 00:31:37.470
strategy is very similar.

00:31:37.470 --> 00:31:40.930
I go to some person
in some village,

00:31:40.930 --> 00:31:42.520
something bad happened.

00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:45.320
That means that this
thing is bad.

00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:46.760
You just look for the people.

00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:49.380
And in some ways, I think
this has been

00:31:49.380 --> 00:31:50.600
the industry's problem.

00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:53.910
And the reason why that guy
got nailed so badly is

00:31:53.910 --> 00:31:57.760
because, instead of saying that
this is something that's

00:31:57.760 --> 00:32:02.460
useful, and we should find out
how useful it is, this started

00:32:02.460 --> 00:32:04.050
by over selling.

00:32:04.050 --> 00:32:06.120
And then they're easy target.

00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:07.820
Everybody now is--

00:32:07.820 --> 00:32:11.450
it's like, if you oversell,
people have high expectations.

00:32:11.450 --> 00:32:14.110
Then you don't deliver, they
get very upset with you.

00:32:14.110 --> 00:32:15.950
And so that's what they're
paying for now.

00:32:15.950 --> 00:32:19.670
And this is like exactly
what you'd expect.

00:32:19.670 --> 00:32:22.980
It's the reason why we were
trying to persuade them for at

00:32:22.980 --> 00:32:26.030
least seven, eight years that
they should have a randomized

00:32:26.030 --> 00:32:28.115
evaluation.

00:32:28.115 --> 00:32:33.170
I remember going to an MFI and
explaining that they should

00:32:33.170 --> 00:32:34.880
have a randomized evacuation.

00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:38.090
They should show that they have
evidence of the impact.

00:32:38.090 --> 00:32:41.250
And the guy told me, he was
an interesting character.

00:32:41.250 --> 00:32:46.000
He was a Canadian who had
started an MFI in rural India.

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:53.850
And he was clearly not doing
this because he was making

00:32:53.850 --> 00:32:54.510
more money.

00:32:54.510 --> 00:32:56.880
He was dedicated to the cause.

00:32:56.880 --> 00:32:59.760
He was living in rural
India, lending people

00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:02.450
who were buying cows.

00:33:02.450 --> 00:33:05.680
But he basically got so
upset with the idea.

00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:12.000
He said, when you buy an apple,
you don't look at the

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:12.940
evaluation of that.

00:33:12.940 --> 00:33:15.610
People are buying credit,
we are selling it.

00:33:15.610 --> 00:33:16.820
What's wrong with that?

00:33:16.820 --> 00:33:21.220
And so he just threw us out
of his office, basically.

00:33:21.220 --> 00:33:22.440
But I think that's
their problem.

00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:24.590
Their problem came from
the beginning.

00:33:24.590 --> 00:33:29.180
They just pushed back on any
possibility that you want to

00:33:29.180 --> 00:33:34.250
make a reasoned view
of these things.

00:33:34.250 --> 00:33:36.880
And then, in some ways, that
creates the problem.

00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:38.130
Yeah.

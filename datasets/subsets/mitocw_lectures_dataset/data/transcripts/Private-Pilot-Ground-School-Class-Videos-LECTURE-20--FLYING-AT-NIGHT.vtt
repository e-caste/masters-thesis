WEBVTT

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:14.920
TINA SRIVASTAVA: All right, so
flying at night is really fun.

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:17.020
And in order to get
your private pilot,

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:19.750
you actually have
to fly at night.

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:24.170
You even have to do a short
cross-country flight at night.

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:27.670
So it's really important for
you to understand the dimensions

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:29.110
of flying at night.

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:32.380
And it's something else to
set personal minimums about.

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:34.180
But overall, I love
flying at night.

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.970
It's one of my
favorite things to do.

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:40.060
And this is actually a
picture that the person

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:43.555
sitting on the right seat took
when I was landing in Bedford.

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.900
So what do you see
in this picture?

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.017
Who can identify
where the runway is?

00:00:54.017 --> 00:00:55.350
Can you at least see the runway?

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.970
All right, this just-- yes?

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:58.650
In the yellow shirt.

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.860
AUDIENCE: It's right
after the yellow cross.

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.319
And there's red
and yellow lights

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:07.020
on either side of the runway.

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.970
And the very end of it is marked
with a line of green lights.

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:11.220
TINA SRIVASTAVA: That's right.

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.270
So the green line is marking
the threshold of the runway.

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.690
Along the sides of the runway,
it's yellow and then becomes

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:19.830
red at the end.

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.725
What are those lights to
the right of the runway?

00:01:25.782 --> 00:01:27.143
AUDIENCE: Glide slope.

00:01:27.143 --> 00:01:28.560
TINA SRIVASTAVA:
Your glide slope.

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.656
What is it called?

00:01:29.656 --> 00:01:30.333
AUDIENCE: PAPI.

00:01:30.333 --> 00:01:31.250
TINA SRIVASTAVA: PAPI.

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:32.330
All right.

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:33.350
Come on, guys.

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.240
We've covered VASIs and PAPIs.

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.540
So the VASI was the vertical one
where the two lights are on top

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.130
and then two lights
are at the bottom.

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.770
And the PAPI is
the horizontal one.

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.560
And so as you can see
in my beautiful picture,

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.600
because it's my perfect
flying abilities,

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.420
I have two red lights
and two white lights.

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:51.260
Thank you very much.

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:54.440
Yes?

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.193
AUDIENCE: It doesn't
look like you're level.

00:01:57.193 --> 00:01:59.360
TINA SRIVASTAVA: It either
looks like I'm not level,

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.235
or the person taking
the picture isn't level.

00:02:01.235 --> 00:02:02.622
But it's definitely not level.

00:02:02.622 --> 00:02:03.330
I agree with you.

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.620
Now I would tell you how
I'm getting bounced around

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:10.460
by the wind.

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:14.540
But in fact, at night, usually,
there isn't that much wind.

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.080
So let's talk about the
definition of night.

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.110
We actually had a good
conversation at dinner

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.690
last night with Mark Nathanson.

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.700
And he was talking
about his FAA exam

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.310
where he was examining
a friend of mine, Emily,

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.180
on her oral exam and
asked her when's sunset?

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.520
And she said, well,
which sunset do you mean?

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.890
So there are a lot of
different definitions.

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.890
And so if you're
just flying at night

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.770
and you want to log hours
that you're flying at night,

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:46.670
then it's really any time after
sunset or after civil twilight.

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.530
But there are
specific requirements

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.710
in terms of having
landings at night.

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:53.540
And you can log
whether your landing

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.760
is at night or during the day.

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.560
And they're a little bit
more strict restrictions.

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.455
So the landing has to be
a full hour after sunset.

00:03:02.455 --> 00:03:04.580
And if you're in the wee
hours of the morning, then

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.800
a full hour before sunrise.

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:11.820
And that's because it's still
pretty light during that time.

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:13.940
So even after the
sun sets, it stays

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:15.592
bright for about an hour or so.

00:03:15.592 --> 00:03:17.300
And so they want to
make sure that you're

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:21.130
really familiar with flying
in true night conditions.

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.630
Yeah.

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:22.710
I love flying at night.

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:26.430
One thing that's a lot easier
is sometimes seeing the traffic,

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:27.930
so seeing other aircraft.

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.880
If you get notified, hey,
there's a traffic 3 o'clock.

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.270
You look out, and there it is.

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:36.180
You can see the light.

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:37.950
There also aren't that
many other planes.

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:39.960
So sometimes you get
the airport to yourself

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:41.850
or the tower
controller to yourself.

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:46.230
And depending on the
weather and the climate,

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.610
it can be really great.

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:50.550
What's really interesting
is that in the US,

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:52.310
there is no special rating.

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:53.310
So we talked about this.

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:58.450
You don't need your instrument
rating to fly at night.

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:02.700
Now that's not the case
in other countries.

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:07.250
And I wouldn't say that we're,
as I think Philip noted,

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:09.578
we don't think that
the Mexicans know--

00:04:09.578 --> 00:04:11.870
we think that maybe they know
something we don't, which

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:14.300
is that you really need to
take a lot of precautions.

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:17.089
Flying at night
is, in some ways,

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:20.420
similar to flying in
instrument conditions.

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:23.360
And we talked about some of
the visual effects and cues

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.240
that you can get disoriented in.

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.060
So during your
private, you're going

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.260
to have three hours of night
training, which is really cool.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:32.800
So you're going to fly at night.

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.920
You're going to also do a
short cross-country flight.

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:39.163
But in terms of
currency requirements,

00:04:39.163 --> 00:04:41.330
some people were asking
about currency requirements,

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:43.610
this is one of the
currency requirements

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:45.290
that you really want
to keep in mind.

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:49.550
So this after you get your pilot
private pilot license, in order

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:52.250
for you to fly with
passengers, you

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:56.450
have to have three takeoffs
and landings to a full stop

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:59.040
within the preceding 90 days.

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.560
So this is important.

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.550
If you go on a trip
during the day.

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:04.160
And if it's going
to be night, you

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.010
might have to land somewhere,
kick out your passengers,

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:10.490
do your currency,
and then continue.

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:13.640
I've had to do
that at least once.

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:15.237
So night vision,
so we talked a lot

00:05:15.237 --> 00:05:16.820
when we're talking
about human factors

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:19.710
about your visual system.

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:21.620
So one thing I
think people might

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:25.190
have heard of the different
rods and cones in your eyes.

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:27.260
So I'm getting a
lot of head nods.

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.020
So the rods are
actually the thing

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:32.120
that can really help you see.

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:35.720
But it's a lot easier
to look on the sides.

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:39.260
So looking straight
during the daytime,

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:40.370
that's where you can see.

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:44.690
But your rods that do a
better job at nighttime

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:47.300
are your primary receptors
for night vision.

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:50.240
And so, unfortunately, the
problem is if you stare right

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:53.510
at something, it might
actually be harder to see it

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:55.160
than if you were
scanning, and you

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:58.470
were five to 10 degrees off
of what you were looking at.

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:00.470
And so one thing
when you're flying

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:03.710
at night, when you're looking
for traffic, instead of just

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:09.900
looking in one spot, try
to scan to look around.

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:12.530
Another thing is that it takes
you a long time for your eyes

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:14.400
to adjust to the darkness.

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:18.170
So you can just probably
have noticed this yourself

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:20.060
when you're in your
room at night or working

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:22.610
on something, your
eyes take a little time

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:26.270
to adjust to that night light.

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:28.820
And so what you want to do,
if you're flying at night,

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:31.850
is to give yourself a
chance to adjust to that.

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:35.120
You don't want to be in
a very bright place right

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:38.690
before you go flying at night
because your eyes won't adjust.

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:42.470
Another thing you can consider
doing is using red lights.

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:43.980
And I actually do that.

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:46.970
So this is a super
fashionable picture

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:49.420
of me wearing a giant headlamp.

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:52.160
And I actually have a
red light headlight.

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:54.050
And there are pros and cons.

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:56.090
I think it's great
because it really helps.

00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:59.180
You can have illumination
without it destroying

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:01.200
your night vision adjustment.

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:03.470
But it also washes
out red color.

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:05.550
So you just want to
keep that in mind.

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:09.620
But also, just in general,
having that lamp on your head

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:11.430
is really helpful.

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:14.000
Although, you look not so great.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.453
It's a good thing that even
if you take off in the evening

00:07:17.453 --> 00:07:19.370
when it's still bright
outside, if you already

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:22.280
have that light in place,
then once it gets dark,

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:24.398
once you need it, you
have it right there.

00:07:24.398 --> 00:07:26.690
Again, you're not bending
over, moving your head a lot,

00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:29.720
and searching the ground or your
bag to look for a flashlight

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:31.970
after it's dark when you're
trying to fly a plane.

00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:33.140
That's not a good thing.

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:35.180
If it's going to get
dark or could possibly

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:36.620
get dark while
you're still flying

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:38.390
have those
flashlights available.

00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:41.270
Make sure you know where the
light buttons are for all

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:43.722
of your instrument panels.

00:07:43.722 --> 00:07:44.680
PHILIP GREENSPUN: Yeah.

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:47.143
It's important to mention
that if the airplane,

00:07:47.143 --> 00:07:48.560
if everything is
working properly,

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:51.440
it should have a dome light
or a map reading light

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:54.050
or something that's
in the airplane.

00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:57.530
So you don't absolutely
need the flashlight

00:07:57.530 --> 00:07:59.803
unless something is broken.

00:07:59.803 --> 00:08:01.220
TINA SRIVASTAVA:
Well, it depends.

00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:03.590
You might need a
flashlight, for example,

00:08:03.590 --> 00:08:06.800
just to conduct your pre-flight
inspection, so to walk around

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:09.260
the airplane, make sure
all of the control surfaces

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:10.670
can move free and clear.

00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:13.190
You want to use a
light to do that.

00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:15.860
I won't get into the details,
but there was an accident

00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:17.300
in Hanscom a couple years back.

00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:20.150
And one of the concerns was
that they had a lock on one

00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:21.600
of the control surfaces.

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:24.110
And it was nighttime when
they were trying to take off.

00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:26.120
And so having a
flashlight, I think,

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:28.730
is really critical in order to
do your pre-flight inspection

00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:31.410
and make sure your
airplane is safe to fly.

00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:31.965
Yes?

00:08:31.965 --> 00:08:34.340
AUDIENCE: I've had this question
for about the last year.

00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:36.539
Can you do anything special
with your iPad at night

00:08:36.539 --> 00:08:38.539
because that's enough to
ruin your night vision.

00:08:38.539 --> 00:08:39.110
TINA SRIVASTAVA: Yeah.

00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:40.443
So that is a very good question.

00:08:40.443 --> 00:08:42.390
Do you do anything
special with your iPad

00:08:42.390 --> 00:08:44.920
because it's enough to
ruin your night vision?

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:45.420
Yeah.

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:48.990
So I actually think it
is definitely something

00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:50.730
I keep in mind always.

00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:53.250
You can adjust the brightness
setting on the iPad.

00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:54.460
It still can be very bright.

00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:57.100
And then sometimes
it has a night mode,

00:08:57.100 --> 00:08:58.625
and that does work
for some things.

00:08:58.625 --> 00:09:00.000
It doesn't work
for other things.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.390
I think the approach plates
are still pretty bright.

00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:06.450
But you can make your whole
map and the weather information

00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:07.720
in night mode.

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:09.750
And I think actually
Garmin default mode

00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:12.690
is a much better
viewable on your iPad

00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:13.840
than for flight as well.

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:17.780
Yes?

00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:19.850
AUDIENCE: You could also
try inverting colors.

00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:21.774
It makes something
that's white to black.

00:09:21.774 --> 00:09:23.123
I

00:09:23.123 --> 00:09:24.040
TINA SRIVASTAVA: Yeah.

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:25.915
AUDIENCE: Some of the
colors that go on a map

00:09:25.915 --> 00:09:27.744
are the colors that
won't show correctly.

00:09:27.744 --> 00:09:29.323
But it's something you can try.

00:09:29.323 --> 00:09:30.990
TINA SRIVASTAVA: Yeah,
so the suggestion

00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:33.792
was when you're using a
tablet to invert the colors,

00:09:33.792 --> 00:09:36.000
and that can help make
everything white that's black.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.655
Would also be where the
other colors might change.

00:09:38.655 --> 00:09:41.280
So if you're looking for
cues like we talked earlier

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:43.890
about the VFR versus
IFR lights, make sure

00:09:43.890 --> 00:09:47.590
the green didn't turn red and
the red didn't turn green.

00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:52.430
OK, so night illusions, so this
is something to keep in mind.

00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:54.160
Especially in the
Northeast, there's

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:57.550
so many airports but
also cities everywhere.

00:09:57.550 --> 00:10:00.460
And a lot of times,
you can accidentally

00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:02.730
think that certain lights
are something else.

00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:06.222
We talked about the black
hole illusion earlier

00:10:06.222 --> 00:10:07.930
when we were talking
about human factors.

00:10:07.930 --> 00:10:11.230
That if, for example,
there's a lot of snow around

00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:13.570
and it's dark, it
makes it even harder

00:10:13.570 --> 00:10:15.700
to see features on the ground.

00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:20.620
And if it makes it, you might
actually be lower than you are,

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:22.480
than you think you are
just because if there

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:24.370
aren't any visual
cues where you see

00:10:24.370 --> 00:10:26.440
exactly where the ground is.

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:30.190
Another concern is if the
runway lights are too bright,

00:10:30.190 --> 00:10:33.070
it can make it seem like
the runway is closer to you.

00:10:33.070 --> 00:10:36.370
So that's why a VASI or a
PAPI, some sort of glide slope

00:10:36.370 --> 00:10:39.400
reference is a really good
idea at night to make sure

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:41.200
your eyes aren't
playing tricks on you,

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:44.200
and you're actually
where you think you are.

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:46.800
So there's a whole bunch
of equipment ratings

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:47.720
that you need.

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:50.260
This is you need
everything that you need

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:52.100
during the day for VFR flight.

00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:54.520
But you also need some
additional lights.

00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:57.500
And certainly, if you want
to think about another issue

00:10:57.500 --> 00:10:58.600
is the electrical system.

00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:00.340
So that's a more
difficult thing.

00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:02.410
That if you lose your
electrical system

00:11:02.410 --> 00:11:04.180
when you're flying
at night, you don't

00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:06.190
have the ability to
look outside to see

00:11:06.190 --> 00:11:07.722
where you are quite as easily.

00:11:07.722 --> 00:11:08.680
PHILIP GREENSPUN: Yeah.

00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:10.390
And if your airplane
has circuit breakers

00:11:10.390 --> 00:11:12.000
and doesn't have
fuses, then you don't

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.520
need the spare set of fuses,
just so you aren't concerned.

00:11:17.507 --> 00:11:19.340
TINA SRIVASTAVA: And
then this is a reminder

00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:22.040
of all that equipment
that you need anyway

00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:24.830
during the day for flying.

00:11:24.830 --> 00:11:27.680
So speaking more specifically
about the lights that

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:30.020
are required on an
aircraft, so you actually

00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:33.452
have to have lights
related to navigation.

00:11:33.452 --> 00:11:35.660
And so there are different
type of navigation lights.

00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:41.000
In general, you have a red
light on the left to try to say,

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.680
red is like port.

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:45.190
Port is red.

00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:46.410
The port wine is red.

00:11:46.410 --> 00:11:47.730
And so red is on the left.

00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:51.140
That's one way they suggest
that you remember that.

00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:54.380
There's also this big
anti-collision strobe light

00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:56.732
that blinks.

00:11:56.732 --> 00:11:58.190
Sometimes you
actually have to have

00:11:58.190 --> 00:12:00.830
that light all the time
like even during the day

00:12:00.830 --> 00:12:02.210
to avoid collisions.

00:12:02.210 --> 00:12:04.160
But it's especially
important at night.

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:06.110
But what's also
especially important

00:12:06.110 --> 00:12:07.400
is when you turn it off.

00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:09.590
You don't want to keep
that anti-collision strobe

00:12:09.590 --> 00:12:11.872
light on when you're
taxiing on the ground.

00:12:11.872 --> 00:12:13.580
Again, when you're
flying, sometimes it's

00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:15.320
hard to tell if
something's on the ground

00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:16.620
or if it's in the air.

00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:18.290
And if you see a
bunch of lights,

00:12:18.290 --> 00:12:20.570
you might think it's
a plane that's flying,

00:12:20.570 --> 00:12:22.220
and it can get confusing.

00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:25.010
So once you're off
of an active runway,

00:12:25.010 --> 00:12:30.190
also turn off your
anti-collision strobe light.

00:12:30.190 --> 00:12:33.250
This is where it talks about
that red light on the left

00:12:33.250 --> 00:12:35.290
is port.

00:12:35.290 --> 00:12:38.170
But the basic idea is
based on where these are.

00:12:38.170 --> 00:12:42.710
That if you see a red light,
that it's probably an airplane.

00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:47.620
And so if the red light
is on the left wing,

00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:49.990
and you see an
airplane, it's usually

00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:51.820
if I'm flying an
airplane and this

00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:54.890
is another airplane crossing
me, if it's flying in this way,

00:12:54.890 --> 00:12:55.930
I see the red light.

00:12:55.930 --> 00:12:58.750
If it's flying the other way,
then I see the green light.

00:12:58.750 --> 00:13:00.670
So the colors help
you figure out

00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:02.077
which way the plane is going.

00:13:02.077 --> 00:13:03.910
PHILIP GREENSPUN: Yeah,
I realize this slide

00:13:03.910 --> 00:13:04.827
is a little confusing.

00:13:04.827 --> 00:13:07.150
That flashing red is not one
of the navigation lights.

00:13:07.150 --> 00:13:11.140
That would be like an
anti-collision beacon

00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:12.753
or something rotating.

00:13:12.753 --> 00:13:13.670
TINA SRIVASTAVA: Yeah.

00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:15.730
And we'll talk
about beacons next.

00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:18.790
So one thing that's really
fun is when you're flying

00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:21.530
is to look for airports.

00:13:21.530 --> 00:13:23.680
So even if you're on
a commercial flight,

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:26.890
I really recommend just staring
out the window while you're

00:13:26.890 --> 00:13:28.900
flying over a city
and try to see if you

00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:30.380
can see one of these beacons.

00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:31.840
And odds are, you probably will.

00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:35.110
Even if you're in a tall
building and look out,

00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:36.640
the Northeast has
so many airports,

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:39.070
you might be able to find
one of these beacons.

00:13:39.070 --> 00:13:44.050
So it'll basically be flashing
green, white, green, white.

00:13:44.050 --> 00:13:47.540
Or if it's a military
airport, slightly different.

00:13:47.540 --> 00:13:51.880
And so this little video, if you
pay attention on the top right

00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:58.360
corner, it's showing
that green, white, green.

00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:00.430
And the way that I just
said it where you see it,

00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:02.200
and you say what's
happening, that's

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:06.138
a good way to check with your
co-pilot or just the person

00:14:06.138 --> 00:14:08.680
sitting next to you if they're
seeing the same thing you are.

00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:10.300
So there's so many
lights in a city.

00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:11.260
And they're different colors.

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:13.450
And they're same color as
street lights and other lights.

00:14:13.450 --> 00:14:14.560
And so to really
make sure you've

00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:16.900
identified an airport and
the other person sitting

00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:19.000
next you identified
the same airport

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.250
and you both agree you're
heading to the same place,

00:14:21.250 --> 00:14:24.275
it's good to make sure that you
guys are following the beacon.

00:14:24.275 --> 00:14:26.650
And you're making sure you've
identified the same airport

00:14:26.650 --> 00:14:29.850
that you're heading to.

00:14:29.850 --> 00:14:32.877
So this is that just seems like
people had a lot of familiarity

00:14:32.877 --> 00:14:35.460
when we even just started with
the first picture of me landing

00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:36.300
at Bedford.

00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:38.853
So you can see all the
different lights on a runway.

00:14:38.853 --> 00:14:40.770
The types of lights that
you see on the runway

00:14:40.770 --> 00:14:42.450
depend on the runway itself.

00:14:42.450 --> 00:14:44.670
So a smaller airport
might only just

00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:47.870
have lights on the
boundary of the runway.

00:14:47.870 --> 00:14:50.730
Whereas a really
big, long runway,

00:14:50.730 --> 00:14:55.140
Boston Logan has a whole
bunch of lights going on.

00:14:55.140 --> 00:14:59.190
The blue lights are
actually the taxiway lights.

00:14:59.190 --> 00:15:01.290
And again, so if you're
on a commercial flight,

00:15:01.290 --> 00:15:04.350
really highly recommend getting
a window seat even if you

00:15:04.350 --> 00:15:06.300
have to pay $20 bucks for it.

00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:08.573
And while you're taxiing,
look out the window,

00:15:08.573 --> 00:15:10.990
and you'll see all these blue
lights while you're taxiing.

00:15:10.990 --> 00:15:13.020
And you can look at the
runway markers as well.

00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:16.740
Yes?

00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:18.610
AUDIENCE: At the
beginning of the runway,

00:15:18.610 --> 00:15:29.783
there's another [INAUDIBLE]
parallel and then [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:29.783 --> 00:15:30.700
TINA SRIVASTAVA: Yeah.

00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:33.300
So you sometimes call
those approach light bars.

00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:36.870
And those are at
big, big airports.

00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:42.360
And even some runways even have
what's called a, is it a rabbit

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:45.537
or a ribbon, where
they have lights that--

00:15:45.537 --> 00:15:47.370
AUDIENCE: It's a lead
in, the lead in light.

00:15:47.370 --> 00:15:48.430
TINA SRIVASTAVA:
A lead in light.

00:15:48.430 --> 00:15:49.805
So it's not even
that they're all

00:15:49.805 --> 00:15:53.940
just on but a light that turns.

00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:57.150
So there's a row of lights,
and they turn them on in a row.

00:15:57.150 --> 00:16:02.990
So it looks like a line that's
pointing towards the runway.

00:16:02.990 --> 00:16:06.500
So even here at Hanscom,
one of the runways has that.

00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:09.740
The one with the ILS
approach has that.

00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:11.852
I think they call it a
ribbon or a rabbit light.

00:16:11.852 --> 00:16:13.810
AUDIENCE: It can also be
called a rabbit, yeah.

00:16:13.810 --> 00:16:14.560
TINA SRIVASTAVA: A rabbit.

00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:15.060
Yeah.

00:16:18.290 --> 00:16:21.410
So this is a story I just
wanted to share with you.

00:16:21.410 --> 00:16:25.295
Recently, I did a flight
to Lawrence Airport.

00:16:25.295 --> 00:16:27.080
So Lawrence is very close by.

00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:29.360
It's just north of here.

00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:33.680
And I was going to
land at this airport.

00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:38.420
And I know that from all
the markings in the book

00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:41.990
that this runway that I
was landing at had a PAPI.

00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:43.880
But as I was coming
in to land, so this

00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:48.400
is-- so if you look
in this, so the runway

00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:54.210
is up in the left corner
of this picture over here.

00:16:54.210 --> 00:16:56.610
And so that's what the
runway looked like.

00:16:56.610 --> 00:16:57.750
This is the picture.

00:16:57.750 --> 00:17:01.640
As you can see on the left and
the right, there is no PAPI.

00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:03.150
So there's no PAPI there.

00:17:03.150 --> 00:17:05.121
And so as I was
coming in to land,

00:17:05.121 --> 00:17:07.079
I wanted to make sure I
was in the right place,

00:17:07.079 --> 00:17:08.579
everything was working properly.

00:17:08.579 --> 00:17:10.200
So I asked the tower controller.

00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:11.609
It was a towered airport.

00:17:11.609 --> 00:17:14.310
Is the PAPI on?

00:17:14.310 --> 00:17:14.970
Is it active?

00:17:14.970 --> 00:17:15.540
Is it broken?

00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:17.280
Is there something I
missed in the no tam

00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:18.720
that the PAPI was out.

00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:21.180
And he said that
the PAPI was on.

00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:24.480
And so this confused me because,
obviously, the PAPI is not on.

00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:27.420
And so I didn't know exactly.

00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:28.410
Something was wrong.

00:17:28.410 --> 00:17:31.770
Either it was out, or maybe
I was at the wrong runway.

00:17:31.770 --> 00:17:33.610
I didn't want to
take any chances.

00:17:33.610 --> 00:17:35.340
So I executed a go around.

00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:39.270
And I told the tower controller,
I don't see the PAPI.

00:17:39.270 --> 00:17:41.490
He was like, no, the
PAPI is definitely on.

00:17:41.490 --> 00:17:42.948
So OK.

00:17:42.948 --> 00:17:43.740
I did my go around.

00:17:43.740 --> 00:17:45.750
I proceeded in the
traffic pattern.

00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:46.620
I came back.

00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:49.430
And miraculously, the
second time around, I

00:17:49.430 --> 00:17:52.410
could see the PAPI very clearly.

00:17:52.410 --> 00:17:54.000
Tower controller
stuck to his story

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.250
that it was on the whole time.

00:17:55.250 --> 00:17:58.210
But I have photo evidence
that that wasn't true.

00:17:58.210 --> 00:18:00.810
So here on the left,
you can see the PAPI.

00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:06.770
I think the reason that
story is relevant also,

00:18:06.770 --> 00:18:09.470
though, is that you want to
make sure that you are seeing

00:18:09.470 --> 00:18:11.120
what you expect to see, right?

00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:13.100
We talked about the
importance of a PAPI

00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:17.600
certainly to help with issues
in terms of what your height is

00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:19.520
and visual illusions
that are going on.

00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:21.500
But also, if you expect
something to be there

00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:24.440
and it's not, maybe there's
a lighted wind sock.

00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:26.180
And the lighted wind
sock's not there.

00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:27.710
You might want to check.

00:18:27.710 --> 00:18:30.050
Did I miss a notification
of it being out?

00:18:30.050 --> 00:18:31.490
Or am I in the right place?

00:18:31.490 --> 00:18:33.470
You don't want to
proceed, especially

00:18:33.470 --> 00:18:37.590
at night, into an area that
you might not be familiar with.

00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:39.300
It also obviously
helps to have a tower

00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:40.540
controller to talk to you.

00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:42.290
If you're at an
uncontrolled airport,

00:18:42.290 --> 00:18:44.010
there is something called
pilot-controlled lighting

00:18:44.010 --> 00:18:44.843
that we'll get into.

00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:54.320
So this is just talking more
about lights at big runways.

00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:56.150
OK, pilot-controlled lighting.

00:18:56.150 --> 00:18:59.630
So you'll see in
this little video,

00:18:59.630 --> 00:19:02.690
so it starts off there's
no light at the runway.

00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:06.120
And then, all of a
sudden, the light pops up.

00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:08.880
So we're looking
right over here.

00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:11.028
And that one has that
ribbon light or rabbit

00:19:11.028 --> 00:19:12.320
light that I was talking about.

00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:15.777
So you see the white
light that's moving.

00:19:15.777 --> 00:19:17.360
And then it lights
up the whole thing.

00:19:20.130 --> 00:19:22.130
So pilot-controlled
lighting is kind of cool.

00:19:22.130 --> 00:19:26.883
So at non-towered airports
or even at airports

00:19:26.883 --> 00:19:29.050
that are usually towered
but at night they might not

00:19:29.050 --> 00:19:31.930
have the tower controller
working overnight,

00:19:31.930 --> 00:19:33.782
they can turn off the lights.

00:19:33.782 --> 00:19:35.740
And the way that you turn
it on is you actually

00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:37.070
do pilot-controlled lighting.

00:19:37.070 --> 00:19:38.470
So there's a frequency.

00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:39.910
Sometimes it's
the same frequency

00:19:39.910 --> 00:19:42.360
as the tower frequency.

00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:44.380
And you basically
on the same button

00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:47.650
that you hold down when you're
speaking, you just click it.

00:19:47.650 --> 00:19:49.150
So you keep pushing that button.

00:19:49.150 --> 00:19:52.720
So if you push it five times,
it turns on the lights.

00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:54.550
The number of
times you click it,

00:19:54.550 --> 00:19:59.350
impacts what the brightness is
of the intensity of the light.

00:19:59.350 --> 00:20:02.020
One thing to also keep in mind
is that the light is usually

00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:04.160
only on for about 15 minutes.

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:07.420
So if you're still very
far away from the airport,

00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:09.700
it's not a good idea
to turn the light

00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:12.400
on because you don't want a
situation where it takes you

00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:14.030
15 minutes to get there.

00:20:14.030 --> 00:20:16.802
And then as soon as you're
landing, the light turn off.

00:20:16.802 --> 00:20:18.760
So it's good to just wait
until you're actually

00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:21.380
close to the
airport and do that.

00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:23.920
Now one thing that maybe isn't
recommended but is really

00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:28.510
fun to do, one time,
I was flying at night.

00:20:28.510 --> 00:20:31.320
And I was flying over a
bunch of untowered airports.

00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:33.637
There are a whole bunch
in the Northeast area.

00:20:33.637 --> 00:20:35.720
And just to get used to
pilot-controlled lighting,

00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:39.080
we would look up untowered
airports we were flying over.

00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:41.267
And we would just light
up various airports.

00:20:41.267 --> 00:20:42.100
That was really fun.

00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:43.220
But it's generally a bad idea.

00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:44.800
Again, because if
somebody is coming

00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:47.937
in to land and the
lights are already on,

00:20:47.937 --> 00:20:49.770
they might off when
they're not supposed to.

00:20:49.770 --> 00:20:51.640
So you really want
the pilot who's

00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:53.380
landing to control
when it turns on,

00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:54.850
so they get their 15 minutes.

00:20:58.100 --> 00:20:59.580
So I just wanted
to have a-- yes?

00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:00.960
Go ahead.

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:03.400
AUDIENCE: Are the PAPI and
VASI light always on the left

00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:05.497
or sometimes on the right?

00:21:05.497 --> 00:21:06.330
TINA SRIVASTAVA: No.

00:21:06.330 --> 00:21:07.980
The question is, are
the PAPI and VASI

00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:11.310
lights always on either the left
or on the right of the runway?

00:21:11.310 --> 00:21:11.820
And no.

00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:13.472
I think I've seen
both situations.

00:21:13.472 --> 00:21:14.430
PHILIP GREENSPUN: Yeah.

00:21:14.430 --> 00:21:16.080
I think left is
kind of standard.

00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:19.983
But for whatever reason, you
also may see them on the right.

00:21:19.983 --> 00:21:20.900
TINA SRIVASTAVA: Yeah.

00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:25.545
I think they were on the left
here in this Lawrence picture.

00:21:27.755 --> 00:21:29.380
AUDIENCE: At what
point in the approach

00:21:29.380 --> 00:21:31.458
do you typically want
to see the lights?

00:21:31.458 --> 00:21:33.500
TINA SRIVASTAVA: So at
what point in the approach

00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:35.240
do you want to see the lights?

00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:37.658
Well, usually, before
you're making your approach,

00:21:37.658 --> 00:21:38.450
you see the lights.

00:21:38.450 --> 00:21:41.090
So when you're
identifying the airport

00:21:41.090 --> 00:21:42.770
is when you see the lights.

00:21:42.770 --> 00:21:45.530
So we didn't talk
about it much today

00:21:45.530 --> 00:21:47.570
but how you usually
do a landing,

00:21:47.570 --> 00:21:49.760
we discussed a little bit
on instrument approaches.

00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:53.050
But when you're just flying
VFR, including VFR at night,

00:21:53.050 --> 00:21:54.800
the way that you do
an approach to landing

00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:58.130
actually involves flying.

00:21:58.130 --> 00:22:00.590
Let me draw it over here.

00:22:00.590 --> 00:22:02.920
PHILIP GREENSPUN: And
while you're doing that,

00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:07.298
I'll point out that the
runway lights are directional.

00:22:07.298 --> 00:22:08.840
So they'll be
substantial-- if you're

00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:10.700
lined up with the runway,
they'll be a lot brighter.

00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:12.283
Still not as bright
as the surrounding

00:22:12.283 --> 00:22:15.230
clutter and the shopping
malls and so forth.

00:22:15.230 --> 00:22:16.880
But they'll be
much, much brighter

00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:18.740
when you're lined
up with the runway

00:22:18.740 --> 00:22:20.810
than if you're looking
from straight down

00:22:20.810 --> 00:22:26.930
or from the downwind leg as
Tine is about to draw for you.

00:22:26.930 --> 00:22:29.000
TINA SRIVASTAVA: So if
this is your runway,

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.350
and so it would have all
of its runway markings.

00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:34.256
So let's say this is runway 29.

00:22:34.256 --> 00:22:38.150
You don't just-- you could do
a straight in where you just

00:22:38.150 --> 00:22:39.110
kind of come to it.

00:22:39.110 --> 00:22:41.480
But most of the time,
you would practice

00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:44.780
doing an approach
where you actually

00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:49.740
enter the traffic
pattern 45 degrees,

00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:51.860
so at a 45 degree angle here.

00:22:55.890 --> 00:23:00.330
And then you enter this
is kind of the midpoint.

00:23:00.330 --> 00:23:02.960
So you enter in
at the 45 degrees,

00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:05.610
and then you continue this way.

00:23:05.610 --> 00:23:09.380
And so that's considered
being on the downwind leg.

00:23:09.380 --> 00:23:13.100
So why would it be considered
being on the downwind leg?

00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:13.913
Anyone?

00:23:13.913 --> 00:23:16.080
AUDIENCE: The wind's blowing
that way because you're

00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:17.090
landing this way.

00:23:17.090 --> 00:23:17.690
TINA SRIVASTAVA: Exactly.

00:23:17.690 --> 00:23:18.110
Exactly.

00:23:18.110 --> 00:23:18.680
Very good.

00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:21.950
So the wind is going
to be blowing this way.

00:23:21.950 --> 00:23:25.860
Because when you land, you
want to land into the wind.

00:23:25.860 --> 00:23:28.340
And so if you're flying
in the opposite direction

00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:30.920
of the runway, the wind's
going to be behind you.

00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:34.160
So you're on the downwind leg.

00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:38.150
This point over here is
called being abeam the runway

00:23:38.150 --> 00:23:39.860
or abeam the numbers.

00:23:39.860 --> 00:23:44.120
And then, you fly
out about to here.

00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:47.660
Usually, you'll start getting
used to what this angle is.

00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:49.190
It might also be 45 degrees.

00:23:49.190 --> 00:23:53.755
But sometimes it depends on
if there are noise abatement

00:23:53.755 --> 00:23:55.880
areas, and you're supposed
to make a close approach

00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:57.410
or a different approach.

00:23:57.410 --> 00:24:00.080
But essentially, you
come out over here.

00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:02.720
You can see the
runway out your wing.

00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:07.140
And then you turn your base
leg, so that's this way.

00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:08.690
So then you're on base.

00:24:08.690 --> 00:24:10.453
Pretty much, depending
on the airplane,

00:24:10.453 --> 00:24:11.870
when you're abeam
the numbers, you

00:24:11.870 --> 00:24:15.020
might start getting into runway
in your landing configuration.

00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:18.590
You might start putting
10 degrees of flaps,

00:24:18.590 --> 00:24:19.790
slowing down your airspeed.

00:24:19.790 --> 00:24:24.740
You might want to be 80
or 90 knots of airspeed.

00:24:24.740 --> 00:24:26.810
Then you turn base.

00:24:26.810 --> 00:24:29.090
You might want to put in
another 10 degrees of flaps.

00:24:29.090 --> 00:24:31.700
You're at 20 degrees of flaps.

00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:33.890
And then, as you come
in, you might want

00:24:33.890 --> 00:24:36.350
to be between 80 and 90 knots.

00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:39.050
And now when you turn
final, that's final.

00:24:39.050 --> 00:24:41.990
And as you get much
closer, it's short final.

00:24:41.990 --> 00:24:45.710
And here, you want
to be trying to be

00:24:45.710 --> 00:24:49.040
very aligned with the
numbers and the runway.

00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:52.880
At the beginning, you want to
be looking at the VASI and PAPI.

00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:55.670
But once you get closer, again,
you want to look at the runway

00:24:55.670 --> 00:24:56.570
itself.

00:24:56.570 --> 00:24:58.490
So the question was
when do you want to see

00:24:58.490 --> 00:25:00.230
the lights of the runway?

00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:03.655
Before you enter the traffic
pattern, you want to see that.

00:25:03.655 --> 00:25:05.030
Because otherwise,
you don't know

00:25:05.030 --> 00:25:07.253
exactly where the midpoint is.

00:25:07.253 --> 00:25:08.420
You don't know how to enter.

00:25:08.420 --> 00:25:10.337
You don't know how to
make sure you're exactly

00:25:10.337 --> 00:25:12.112
flying alongside the runway.

00:25:12.112 --> 00:25:13.070
PHILIP GREENSPUN: Yeah.

00:25:13.070 --> 00:25:15.690
And just keep in mind, this
is called right traffic

00:25:15.690 --> 00:25:17.230
because you're
making right turns.

00:25:17.230 --> 00:25:19.190
At a towered airport
like Hanscom,

00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:21.170
depending on what direction
you're coming from,

00:25:21.170 --> 00:25:23.840
you'll be assigned either right
or left traffic to keep you

00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:25.160
from crossing the runway.

00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:27.860
At an untowered airport,
it's conventional, usually,

00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:31.010
to fly left traffic
pattern unless there's

00:25:31.010 --> 00:25:32.900
terrain or some other
consideration that'll

00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:34.260
be published.

00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:37.250
And they'll tell you that
right pattern is preferred.

00:25:37.250 --> 00:25:39.190
But if they don't
tell you anything,

00:25:39.190 --> 00:25:40.910
then left traffic
is the convention.

00:25:40.910 --> 00:25:41.350
TINA SRIVASTAVA:
Yeah, absolutely.

00:25:41.350 --> 00:25:43.730
And just for completeness,
once you take off,

00:25:43.730 --> 00:25:45.020
you're in the upwind.

00:25:45.020 --> 00:25:48.110
And then you could turn
crosswind and then downwind

00:25:48.110 --> 00:25:48.740
again.

00:25:48.740 --> 00:25:50.330
And there might be
other people that

00:25:50.330 --> 00:25:53.540
are flying the other side
of the traffic pattern

00:25:53.540 --> 00:25:56.060
at the same time.

00:25:56.060 --> 00:25:58.220
So that's usually
the case at Hanscom.

00:25:58.220 --> 00:25:59.930
There are people doing both.

00:25:59.930 --> 00:26:01.120
Is there a question?

00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:01.723
Yes?

00:26:01.723 --> 00:26:03.140
AUDIENCE: Are there
any situations

00:26:03.140 --> 00:26:05.450
where you have to call an
airport to turn on the lights

00:26:05.450 --> 00:26:06.547
like you were saying?

00:26:06.547 --> 00:26:07.630
TINA SRIVASTAVA: Oh, yeah.

00:26:07.630 --> 00:26:10.460
So the question was, do
you have to call an airport

00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:12.500
to tell them to
turn on the lights?

00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:15.170
So Hyannis, in the story
I was giving before,

00:26:15.170 --> 00:26:16.530
had the lights on.

00:26:16.530 --> 00:26:19.190
But as we talked
about procession,

00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:22.640
your heading indicator,
in this particular plane,

00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:24.260
was really, really not good.

00:26:24.260 --> 00:26:29.960
And regardless, you have to keep
updating your heading indicator

00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:33.050
with your magnetic
compass during flight.

00:26:33.050 --> 00:26:34.670
So your heading
indicator is going

00:26:34.670 --> 00:26:37.705
to drift and get a
couple degrees off.

00:26:37.705 --> 00:26:39.080
And so throughout
the flight, you

00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:42.740
have to continuously look
at your magnetic compass

00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:45.440
and adjust your
heading indicator.

00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:49.490
And so usually, you only have
to do that every so often, maybe

00:26:49.490 --> 00:26:51.140
every 30 minutes, every hour.

00:26:51.140 --> 00:26:54.095
But this particular
plane that it was in it

00:26:54.095 --> 00:26:56.030
was just a terrible instrument.

00:26:56.030 --> 00:26:58.980
And it would get 20 degrees
off within five minutes.

00:26:58.980 --> 00:27:01.760
And I was basically just
moving it all the time.

00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:03.710
The thing was basically busted.

00:27:03.710 --> 00:27:06.860
And the problem with it
was I was flying at night.

00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:09.505
And at nighttime, although
you can illuminate your flight

00:27:09.505 --> 00:27:10.880
instruments, you
can't illuminate

00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:12.510
that magnetic compass.

00:27:12.510 --> 00:27:14.720
And so that little ball
with the liquid in it,

00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:18.290
I couldn't illuminate it without
having my headlight on and then

00:27:18.290 --> 00:27:19.580
losing my night vision.

00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:21.680
So it very difficult
for me to figure out

00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:25.088
exactly what heading I was
on at that particular moment.

00:27:25.088 --> 00:27:26.630
And so that's why
I wanted to call up

00:27:26.630 --> 00:27:29.270
Hyannis, which had two
intersecting runways,

00:27:29.270 --> 00:27:31.100
to just double check
and double confirm

00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:33.740
I was going into the runway
that I thought I was going into.

00:27:33.740 --> 00:27:36.680
And the really nice tower
controller at Hyannis

00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:39.587
lit up to a higher light
intensity the runway

00:27:39.587 --> 00:27:42.170
that I was going to land on, so
I could make sure, yes, that's

00:27:42.170 --> 00:27:43.170
where I was going.

00:27:43.170 --> 00:27:45.980
And then he reduced the
light intensity back down.

00:27:45.980 --> 00:27:48.355
PHILIP GREENSPUN: That was a
great commercial for a glass

00:27:48.355 --> 00:27:51.290
cockpit or an HSI, which is
slave to a magnetometer out

00:27:51.290 --> 00:27:53.480
in the wing.

00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:56.023
All right, we should
wrap this one up.

00:27:56.023 --> 00:27:57.440
TINA SRIVASTAVA:
So the last thing

00:27:57.440 --> 00:28:00.860
is just I wanted to do it a
little bit of a discussion

00:28:00.860 --> 00:28:05.077
on where you might try to land
if you had an engine failure,

00:28:05.077 --> 00:28:07.160
and you weren't able to
get your engine restarted.

00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:09.200
Most of the time you
have an engine failure,

00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:11.420
there's a whole flow
that you go through.

00:28:11.420 --> 00:28:13.777
And turns out, you probably
messed something up.

00:28:13.777 --> 00:28:15.860
You didn't have enough
mixture of whatever it was,

00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:17.300
and you can get the
engine restarted.

00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:19.050
But if you can't get
the engine restarted,

00:28:19.050 --> 00:28:21.570
and you have to do a forced
landing, where would we go?

00:28:21.570 --> 00:28:24.230
So in this picture,
the red x is where I'm

00:28:24.230 --> 00:28:25.953
saying you had that failure.

00:28:25.953 --> 00:28:28.370
You don't think you could make
it all the way to Mansfield

00:28:28.370 --> 00:28:30.080
or another airport.

00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:31.760
So I threw up a couple letters.

00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:33.018
But where?

00:28:33.018 --> 00:28:34.560
Let's talk about
the thought process.

00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:36.710
How would you decide
where you would land?

00:28:39.770 --> 00:28:41.930
Land in the Hudson.

00:28:41.930 --> 00:28:45.415
OK, one suggestion.

00:28:45.415 --> 00:28:48.292
AUDIENCE: Not A or C because
they're populated areas.

00:28:48.292 --> 00:28:49.250
TINA SRIVASTAVA: Great.

00:28:49.250 --> 00:28:52.160
Not A or C because they
are populated areas.

00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:52.710
Very good.

00:28:52.710 --> 00:28:55.310
You would get that
right on the FAA exam.

00:28:55.310 --> 00:28:57.270
All right, what about B or D?

00:29:00.650 --> 00:29:01.160
Which one?

00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:03.410
Bravo or delta?

00:29:03.410 --> 00:29:04.760
AUDIENCE: Bravo.

00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:05.990
TINA SRIVASTAVA: Yeah, bravo.

00:29:05.990 --> 00:29:08.713
Why would you choose bravo?

00:29:08.713 --> 00:29:09.660
AUDIENCE: It's a road.

00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:10.130
TINA SRIVASTAVA: It's a road.

00:29:10.130 --> 00:29:12.190
Why is a road a good
place to land at night?

00:29:12.190 --> 00:29:14.330
AUDIENCE: As compared to water.

00:29:14.330 --> 00:29:15.950
TINA SRIVASTAVA: As
compared to water.

00:29:15.950 --> 00:29:18.740
D is not on-- delta
is not on water.

00:29:18.740 --> 00:29:23.900
That blue line is a
mode b transponder line.

00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:25.220
AUDIENCE: Illumination.

00:29:25.220 --> 00:29:27.290
TINA SRIVASTAVA:
Illumination, that's it.

00:29:27.290 --> 00:29:29.630
A road is likely
to be illuminated.

00:29:29.630 --> 00:29:31.130
So you can actually
see it at night.

00:29:31.130 --> 00:29:34.460
And it'll be this nice long
runway that you can land on.

00:29:34.460 --> 00:29:35.295
Yes?

00:29:35.295 --> 00:29:37.090
AUDIENCE: I was going
to say it's paved.

00:29:37.090 --> 00:29:37.710
TINA SRIVASTAVA: It's paved.

00:29:37.710 --> 00:29:38.840
AUDIENCE: It's a little
bit more forgiving.

00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:39.720
TINA SRIVASTAVA:
Yeah, absolutely.

00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:42.320
It's much better to pick a
paved surface than landing

00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:45.170
in a dark field which might
turn out to be a lake,

00:29:45.170 --> 00:29:46.670
and you didn't realize.

00:29:46.670 --> 00:29:49.340
Also, D, if you notice,
is towards the mountains.

00:29:49.340 --> 00:29:51.800
So landing in the mountains
is not a good plan.

00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:54.560
Trying to see mountains at
night is not a good plan.

00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:59.470
So it's probably not a good idea
to go north in this picture.

00:29:59.470 --> 00:30:00.258
All right.

00:30:00.258 --> 00:30:01.800
AUDIENCE: What's
the blue line again?

00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:03.467
PHILIP GREENSPUN:
That was the airspace.

00:30:03.467 --> 00:30:04.973
It's part of the Boston bravo.

00:30:04.973 --> 00:30:05.890
TINA SRIVASTAVA: Yeah.

00:30:05.890 --> 00:30:09.040
That's the blue line surrounding
the Boston class bravo

00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:09.540
airspace.

00:30:09.540 --> 00:30:12.040
PHILIP GREENSPUN: Yeah, and
then that magenta one down there

00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:16.240
at the bottom is the 30 nautical
mile mode c veil, it's called.

00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:21.280
And then these here,
that's one tower.

00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:25.890
And these M things, that's
multiple radio towers.

00:30:25.890 --> 00:30:30.675
AUDIENCE: Now how would
the risk of hitting a car

00:30:30.675 --> 00:30:32.453
impact your decision
to land on a road?

00:30:32.453 --> 00:30:33.370
TINA SRIVASTAVA: Yeah.

00:30:33.370 --> 00:30:35.140
So what's really
interesting is actually

00:30:35.140 --> 00:30:37.300
the speed at which you land.

00:30:37.300 --> 00:30:40.630
So this is true for day
or night operations.

00:30:40.630 --> 00:30:43.510
When a Cessna is
landing, it usually

00:30:43.510 --> 00:30:45.970
lands at about 40 to 50 knots.

00:30:45.970 --> 00:30:47.650
And turns out,
that's actually very

00:30:47.650 --> 00:30:50.950
similar to the miles per
hour at which a car would

00:30:50.950 --> 00:30:52.270
be traveling on a highway.

00:30:52.270 --> 00:30:55.600
So what's really cool is if you
did have to land on a highway,

00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:58.523
you'd probably be going about
the same speed as the cars.

00:30:58.523 --> 00:31:00.190
PHILIP GREENSPUN:
Even on busy highways,

00:31:00.190 --> 00:31:01.750
people seem to have
just walked away.

00:31:01.750 --> 00:31:03.917
You never hear about somebody
landing on the highway

00:31:03.917 --> 00:31:05.950
and then was killed by a car.

00:31:05.950 --> 00:31:06.880
All right, let's--

00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:08.672
TINA SRIVASTAVA: And
the last point on that

00:31:08.672 --> 00:31:10.180
is that, in Alaska,
you're actually

00:31:10.180 --> 00:31:12.100
required to do a
landing on a highway

00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:13.678
because they have
so few airports.

00:31:13.678 --> 00:31:15.220
PHILIP GREENSPUN:
In a couple places.

00:31:15.220 --> 00:31:17.140
All right, we've got one
more presentation and then

00:31:17.140 --> 00:31:17.990
the ForeFlight guys.

00:31:17.990 --> 00:31:20.590
So we'll wrap this
with my final advice

00:31:20.590 --> 00:31:24.010
based on I've done a fair
amount of night flying.

00:31:24.010 --> 00:31:26.990
It's good to take off
before civil twilight.

00:31:26.990 --> 00:31:29.700
That gives you time to adjust
to the world of darkness.

00:31:29.700 --> 00:31:32.200
So I like to take off on when
it's still a little bit light.

00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:33.680
I don't mind
landing in the dark,

00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:36.010
especially at a
familiar airport.

00:31:36.010 --> 00:31:39.910
I treat all the non-local night
flights as instrument flights.

00:31:39.910 --> 00:31:41.500
The FAA says you
can fly at night.

00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:42.910
That doesn't mean
that you should

00:31:42.910 --> 00:31:46.210
do every flight at night,
especially without a co-pilot.

00:31:46.210 --> 00:31:50.172
So either bring a co-pilot
or use an IFR approach.

00:31:50.172 --> 00:31:51.880
That helps you to find
the correct runway

00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:53.230
at the correct airport.

00:31:53.230 --> 00:31:56.350
Remember your two-pilot airline
crews have, quite a few times,

00:31:56.350 --> 00:31:59.740
landed at the wrong
airport altogether.

00:31:59.740 --> 00:32:01.840
Bigger airports are
better at night.

00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:02.380
You know?

00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:03.880
Landing at Hanscom
at night is a lot

00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:05.740
like landing during the day.

00:32:05.740 --> 00:32:07.540
There's just a million lights.

00:32:07.540 --> 00:32:09.280
And that's a nice big space.

00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:12.550
And the serious
parachutes good at night.

00:00:21.904 --> 00:00:23.320
PROFESSOR: OK, in
that case, let's

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:31.590
start-- I want to begin by
giving a quick review of where

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:32.720
we were last time.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.470
And then we'll
pick up from there.

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:37.820
Today's lecture,
the main subject

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.175
will be the-- see if this works.

00:00:42.814 --> 00:00:44.730
The main subject will
be the spacetime metric,

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.680
which is what we'll
begin by talking about.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:52.130
And later, I hope we'll be
doing the geodesic equation.

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:56.710
Last time, we began by
talking about open universes.

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.560
And we got to open universes
by way of closed universes.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.680
And we started with this
Robertson-Walker form

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.260
of the closed
universe metric, which

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:13.800
holds for k greater than 0
describing a closed universe.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.850
And then we said if we want
to describe an open universe,

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.930
we can use the same equation,
but let k be less than 0.

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:26.230
And this metric has a name,
the Robertson-Walker metric,

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:28.870
which applies for k
being positive, negative,

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:30.980
or 0 as a special case.

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:34.540
When k is 0, this just
becomes the Euclidean metric

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.400
written in polar coordinates.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.610
So it's a flat space
for k equals 0.

00:01:41.744 --> 00:01:43.160
Then we addressed
the question of,

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.920
why should we believe this
as a proper description

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.370
of an open universe?

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:51.209
We know how to write it.

00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:53.250
And we could make it look
a little better perhaps

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.480
by introducing a kappa,
which is minus k.

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.515
So that kappa could be
positive when k is negative.

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:05.470
To answer that question,
we had to define

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:10.130
what criteria we had in mind for
the metric we were looking for.

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.240
And what we're trying
to do is write down

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.820
a metric that will describe
a homogeneous and isotropic

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:15.389
universe.

00:02:15.389 --> 00:02:16.930
Because from the
beginning of course,

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.460
we said that those are
the key properties that

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:22.180
describe, to a
good approximation,

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.280
the universe that we live in.

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.370
So what we want to know
is that this metric

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.440
is homogeneous and isotropic
when kappa is positive

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.650
and k is negative, the new case.

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.240
For the closed universe case,
we already knew those things

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.000
because in the
closed universe case,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.300
it's obvious because we know
we got it from a sphere.

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.350
And a sphere is clearly
homogeneous and isotropic

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:46.760
from the start.

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.640
So looking at this metric
for kappa positive,

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.590
we see immediately that
it's obviously isotropic,

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.130
at least about the origin.

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:59.740
Because if we just
sit at the origin

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:03.480
and looked at different
angles-- theta and phi--

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.240
the theta phi dependence
of this metric

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.240
is simply given by
that expression.

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:12.840
And this is exactly the
metric of the surface

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.675
of a sphere whose radius happens
to be a of t times little r.

00:03:17.675 --> 00:03:21.870
And we know that that
sphere is isotropic.

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.780
It doesn't look
manifestly isotropic

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:26.320
because when you put
theta phi coordinates

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.410
on the surface of a sphere, you
choose a north pole and measure

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:30.720
everything from that.

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.990
So your coordinates
break the isotropy.

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:37.620
But you know perfectly
well that the sphere itself

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.290
is completely isotropic.

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.580
So isotropy is settled
about the origin.

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:45.367
And if we're soon going
to prove homogeneity,

00:03:45.367 --> 00:03:47.700
it's enough to know that it's
isotropic about the origin

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.340
because homogeneity
will demonstrate

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:51.950
that all points are equivalent.

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:54.010
So if it's isotropic
about the origin,

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:58.640
we will ultimately know that's
isotropic about all points.

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.340
So homogeneity is
the hard thing.

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.860
How do we convince
ourselves that this metric

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:04.960
is homogeneous?

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:08.340
Now, if we look at it, it
doesn't look homogeneous.

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.230
It certainly looks like
the origin is special.

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:13.170
That was the case for
the closed universe

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:15.610
Robertson-Walker metric as well.

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:17.860
So it's certainly not decisive.

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:21.410
But it also doesn't prove that
it's homogeneous by itself.

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:23.340
So we have to figure
out how we would

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.510
prove that it's homogeneous.

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:27.170
And here, we only
sketched an argument.

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:29.220
We didn't really go
through it in detail

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.319
because it gets messy.

00:04:31.319 --> 00:04:33.110
But I think logic of
the argument is clear.

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:36.214
And it's, I think,
rather persuasive

00:04:36.214 --> 00:04:38.130
that this argument would
work if you wrote out

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:39.740
all the equations.

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:42.190
So let me go through
the argument again.

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:45.000
We start by thinking about
how we would demonstrate

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.250
that the closed
universe was homogeneous

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:55.701
in a mathematical way using
algebra rather than words.

00:04:55.701 --> 00:04:57.950
And if we wanted to prove
that the closed universe was

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:01.460
homogeneous using
algebra, we would set out

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:05.030
with the goal of trying to show
that any point-- and we'll let

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:10.124
r sub 0, theta sub 0, pi sub
0 denote an arbitrary point.

00:05:10.124 --> 00:05:11.790
What we'd like to
show is that any point

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:13.830
is equivalent to the origin.

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:16.190
And by equivalent to the
origin, what we really mean

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:18.690
is that we could define a
new coordinate system where

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:21.280
this arbitrary point
would become the origin,

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:24.410
and the metric would look just
like it looked to start with.

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:26.310
And then this new
arbitrary point

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:28.540
will be playing
exactly the same role

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:31.380
that the origin played
in the first place.

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:33.270
So we're looking for
a transformation which

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:37.720
will map r0, theta 0, and phi 0
to the origin while maintaining

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.650
the form of the metric.

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:41.280
And we really know
how to do that,

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:44.490
because we know
from the beginning

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:47.700
that this universe is
homogeneous because

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:50.940
of the way we constructed
it as the coordinization

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:52.280
of the surface of a sphere.

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:55.550
And the sphere is
manifestly homogeneous.

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:58.580
You can rotate any point on
the sphere into any other point

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:01.030
just by performing a rotation,
which certainly does not

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:04.720
change anything about
the metric on the sphere.

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:07.280
So we want to basically
take advantage of that fact.

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:09.270
And we could imagine--
and we can even

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:13.010
carry it out if we have to,
but I only want to imagine it.

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:17.550
I want to imagine constructing
a map from r, theta,

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:20.130
and phi to some new r prime,
theta prime, phi prime.

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:21.902
We want to map the entire space.

00:06:21.902 --> 00:06:23.360
But we want it to
have the property

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:27.490
that the special point--
r0, theta 0, and phi 0--

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:29.840
gets mapped to the origin.

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:32.830
So we want to construct
this general mapping which

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:34.710
has the property that
our special point is

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:36.710
mapped to the origin.

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:40.460
And we can do that
in three steps.

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:42.600
And they're shown
schematically here.

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:45.470
We first simply transform
from our r, theta,

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:48.930
and phi coordinates to the
four coordinates x, y, z,

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:52.360
w that we, in fact, started
with, the four coordinates

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:55.990
that describe the euclidean
four dimensional space in which

00:06:55.990 --> 00:07:00.280
this three dimensional
sphere is embedded.

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:03.530
Once we have the four
dimensional space,

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:06.010
we can perform
euclidean rotations

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:08.270
in that four dimensional space.

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:11.240
And we can perform
any rotation we want.

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:14.740
And we, in principle, know how
to write those out in detail.

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:19.550
And we can choose the rotation,
which maps r0, theta 0, and phi

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:23.520
0, keeping track of where it
went, to the values of x, y.

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:25.290
Z, w that will
ultimately correspond

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:28.397
to the origin of our
coordinate system

00:07:28.397 --> 00:07:30.730
when we get back to r prime,
theta prime, and phi prime.

00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:32.330
So we can arrange
for that to happen

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:34.572
by choosing the
right rotation here.

00:07:34.572 --> 00:07:36.030
And once we've
rotated, we can then

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:38.040
define r prime, theta
prime, and phi prime

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:40.764
in terms of x prime, y
prime, z prime, and w prime

00:07:40.764 --> 00:07:42.930
in exactly the same way as
we did in the first place

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:44.230
when we didn't have primes.

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:46.010
We just used the
same formulas again.

00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:48.052
And that will ensure that
the metric and r prime,

00:07:48.052 --> 00:07:50.593
theta prime, and phi prime will
be just the metric that we've

00:07:50.593 --> 00:07:52.970
had, because it's determined
from the euclidean

00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:57.360
metric in the four dimensional
space in exactly the same way.

00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:58.700
So this does it.

00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:01.910
And we could, in principle,
do it all in detail.

00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:06.570
And we would get a
concrete expression

00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:08.670
for r prime, theta
prime, and phi prime

00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:10.780
in terms of r,
theta, and phi that

00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:13.690
would have the property that we
want of mapping the arbitrary

00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:17.050
point that we chose to become
the origin of the new system.

00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:21.740
So the point is that
once you've written

00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:24.340
that all those
equations, you know

00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:26.019
that they work for k positive.

00:08:26.019 --> 00:08:27.560
But in the end,
you'd just have a set

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:29.790
of equations that define
r prime, theta prime,

00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:33.030
and phi prime in terms
of r, theta, and phi.

00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:36.159
And those equations are
just as valid for k negative

00:08:36.159 --> 00:08:38.950
as they are for k positive.

00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:41.730
And the fact that the
metric will be unchanged

00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:44.480
is also just as valid for
k positive and k negative,

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:46.350
because the metric is
really just determined

00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:48.230
by derivatives of the new
coordinates with respect

00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:49.340
to the old coordinates.

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:52.220
And those are all just
algebraic expressions.

00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:54.300
And if an algebraic
expression is

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:56.660
an equality for
one sine of k, it

00:08:56.660 --> 00:09:00.330
will be an equality for
the other sine of k.

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:03.190
So I think we have good
faith-- although it'd

00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:05.190
be more convincing perhaps
to actually write out

00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:08.090
all equations, but I
think we have good faith

00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:11.560
that the same map will
work for k less than 0.

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:14.790
And by "work," it means that it
will show that any point could

00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:18.180
be mapped to the origin
by a metric-preserving

00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:21.300
transformation, which is the
key thing, which is what we need

00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:24.072
to show that the space
is actually homogeneous

00:09:24.072 --> 00:09:26.030
even though when we write
in these coordinates,

00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:28.370
it doesn't look homogeneous.

00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:30.922
So does that make
sense to everybody?

00:09:30.922 --> 00:09:32.630
Are there any questions
at this point?

00:09:38.957 --> 00:09:40.540
The next thing we
did-- ah, I'm sorry.

00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:42.900
I guess we-- point
out that we're not

00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:45.292
going to actually
show this explicitly

00:09:45.292 --> 00:09:47.000
because the algebra
involved in the steps

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.800
does get very complicated.

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:51.800
I wanted to mention
a few other facts

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:54.150
about this
Robertson-Walker metric.

00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:58.800
One important fact, which we
will not show-- to show it

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:01.070
would take approximately
another lecture.

00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:03.880
It's not an incredibly
deep mathematical fact,

00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:07.480
but it requires
establishing some formalism

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:11.390
to handle descriptions
of curved spaces

00:10:11.390 --> 00:10:14.365
without yet knowing what
the metric is going to be.

00:10:14.365 --> 00:10:16.620
But in any case,
it can be shown--

00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:20.380
and we're going to store
this in back of our heads--

00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:24.330
that any three dimensional,
homogeneous isotropic space can

00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:27.880
be described by this
Robertson-Walker metric.

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:29.970
Now, it's important to
realize that that does not

00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:32.410
mean that the Roberson-Walker
metric is the only way

00:10:32.410 --> 00:10:34.870
to write down a metric for
a homogeneous and isotropic

00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:36.906
space.

00:10:36.906 --> 00:10:38.780
You could choose different
coordinate systems

00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:41.210
that would make
things look different.

00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:44.390
But the point is that for any
homogeneous and isotropic three

00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:48.300
dimensional space, it is always
possible to assign coordinates

00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:50.515
who make the metric the
Roberson-Walker metric, which

00:10:50.515 --> 00:10:52.890
means that if you understand
the Robertson-Walker metric,

00:10:52.890 --> 00:10:55.220
you need to understand
anything else.

00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:57.690
Any homogeneous
and isotropic space

00:10:57.690 --> 00:11:01.190
can be described this way.

00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:05.556
Next, we pointed out last time--
and did a short calculation

00:11:05.556 --> 00:11:07.930
to demonstrate for ourselves--
that for k greater than 0,

00:11:07.930 --> 00:11:10.001
the universe is finite.

00:11:10.001 --> 00:11:11.500
And that's clear
from the beginning,

00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:14.000
because it was described
as a surface of a sphere

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.630
and the surface of
a sphere is finite.

00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:19.870
But for k less
than or equal to 0,

00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:22.510
the variable little r of
the Robertson-Walker metric

00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:24.840
can become arbitrarily large.

00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:27.145
That by itself does not
imply that the space

00:11:27.145 --> 00:11:29.310
is necessarily infinite.

00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:31.110
But you could also
calculate the distance

00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:33.350
from the origin as a
function of little r.

00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:35.480
And that, you can show,
becomes arbitrarily large.

00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:37.420
And that does mean that
the space is literally

00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:39.320
infinite in size.

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:42.070
So for the flat case
or the open case,

00:11:42.070 --> 00:11:46.540
the Robertson-Walker metric
describes an infinite universe.

00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:49.380
And next, so we mentioned--
and this is a homework problem,

00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:51.970
or an optional homework
problem on the current set--

00:11:51.970 --> 00:11:53.710
that the
Gauss-Bolyai-Lobachevsky

00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:59.160
geometry is actually simply
the open universe in the two

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:03.190
dimensional case rather
than three dimensional case.

00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:05.920
So in the language of the
Robertson-Walker metric,

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:07.420
I think it's much
easier to describe

00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:10.740
than in the coordinate system
that Felix Klein invented.

00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:13.735
But it's the same space.

00:12:13.735 --> 00:12:16.040
And on the homework
set, you can work out

00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:18.740
the mapping between
the Klein coordinates

00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:21.330
and the Robertson-Walker
coordinates

00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:22.875
to see that they're
the same space.

00:12:26.182 --> 00:12:26.765
Any questions?

00:12:30.070 --> 00:12:31.280
OK.

00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:35.492
Next, we changed subjects and
started talking about the topic

00:12:35.492 --> 00:12:37.450
that we'll be continuing
now because we did not

00:12:37.450 --> 00:12:40.310
finish this discussion--
the discussion

00:12:40.310 --> 00:12:43.190
of how to go from
this space metric

00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:47.280
that we now understand to
the spacetime metric, which

00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:50.780
is the fundamental quantity
of general relativity

00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:55.660
and which we'll be using to
describe our model universes.

00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:58.120
Time ends up not playing
an important role

00:12:58.120 --> 00:12:59.800
in what we'll be talking about.

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:01.560
But nonetheless, it
is an important part

00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:04.020
of the basic formalism
of general relativity.

00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:05.770
And for some
questions, it's crucial

00:13:05.770 --> 00:13:07.240
how time enters the metric.

00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:10.880
So we will discuss how
time enters the metric.

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:13.280
So we want to generalize the
metric from a spatial metric

00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:14.880
to a spacetime metric.

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:16.390
And the first
thing that means is

00:13:16.390 --> 00:13:21.800
that we want to understand
the relativistically invariant

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:24.730
interval between two
points in spacetime.

00:13:24.730 --> 00:13:28.760
A point in spacetime is
also called an event.

00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:30.940
And we begin with
special relativity

00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:35.480
because that's what all
this is a generalization of.

00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:38.920
In special relativity, one can
define the Lorentz invariant

00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:41.410
distance between two events.

00:13:41.410 --> 00:13:44.120
Here, the events are A
and B. And the coordinates

00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:48.710
of those events are xA,
yA, zA, and tA for event A.

00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:51.090
And as you would
obviously guess,

00:13:51.090 --> 00:13:57.150
xB, yB, zB, and tB for event
B. And the Lorentz invariant

00:13:57.150 --> 00:14:01.270
interval between those
events is s squared sub AB.

00:14:01.270 --> 00:14:04.430
And the first and most important
thing about this interval

00:14:04.430 --> 00:14:07.020
is that it is Lorentz invariant.

00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:10.320
That is, you can compute
it in any inertial frame,

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:13.657
in any Lorentz frame, and
it will have the same value

00:14:13.657 --> 00:14:15.240
even though the
different pieces of it

00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:16.364
will have different values.

00:14:16.364 --> 00:14:18.580
The differences will cancel out.

00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:21.310
And in the end, when you
calculate the sum of these four

00:14:21.310 --> 00:14:24.125
terms to make s
squared sub ab, you

00:14:24.125 --> 00:14:26.847
will find they'll have the same
value in any Lorentz frame.

00:14:26.847 --> 00:14:28.430
And we're not going
to show that fact.

00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:31.730
But we're going to use that
fact, a very well known fact

00:14:31.730 --> 00:14:37.592
to anybody who studied special
relativity in a reasonably way.

00:14:37.592 --> 00:14:39.550
It's important to think
a little bit about what

00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:41.091
the meaning of this
peculiar quantity

00:14:41.091 --> 00:14:43.400
is that mixes space and time.

00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:47.790
And I think the easiest way to
think about the meaning of it

00:14:47.790 --> 00:14:50.190
is to think about special cases.

00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:55.570
And it's a real number which
could be positive, negative,

00:14:55.570 --> 00:14:56.070
or 0.

00:14:56.070 --> 00:14:57.444
And those are the
special cases I

00:14:57.444 --> 00:15:01.260
want to think about--
positive, negative, or 0.

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:05.790
So if s squared is
positive, it means

00:15:05.790 --> 00:15:08.426
that the separation
between the two events

00:15:08.426 --> 00:15:09.550
is what's called spacelike.

00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:12.242
It's dominated by
the spatial term.

00:15:12.242 --> 00:15:13.700
And if that's the
case, it's always

00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:15.810
possible to find a
frame where the two

00:15:15.810 --> 00:15:17.660
events are simultaneous.

00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:20.760
And in that frame,
s squared is just

00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:23.830
the square of the distance
between the two events,

00:15:23.830 --> 00:15:25.280
so has a clear interpretation.

00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:27.840
It's just the distance
in the Lorentz frame

00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:30.830
in which they occur
simultaneously.

00:15:30.830 --> 00:15:34.920
Similarly, if s
squared is negative,

00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:39.590
it means it's dominated
by the negative time term.

00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:42.750
And in that case, the
separation is called timelike,

00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:44.530
as you'd guess.

00:15:44.530 --> 00:15:46.850
And it has the property
that it's always

00:15:46.850 --> 00:15:50.770
possible to find a Lorentz frame
in which the two events occur

00:15:50.770 --> 00:15:53.710
at exactly the same
point in space.

00:15:53.710 --> 00:15:58.640
And in that frame,
s squared is equal,

00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:00.950
up to a factor of
minus c squared,

00:16:00.950 --> 00:16:04.620
to the time separation
between the two events.

00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:07.280
So s squared measures the time
separation between the two

00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:10.202
events in the frame at which
they happen in the same place.

00:16:10.202 --> 00:16:11.910
And s squared is
actually minus c squared

00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:15.520
times the time
separation squared.

00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:17.930
And finally, if s
squared is 0, that's

00:16:17.930 --> 00:16:19.860
called a lightlike separation.

00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:21.940
And it means that the
two events are separated

00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:25.835
by just the right distance so
that if a light pulse left one,

00:16:25.835 --> 00:16:27.585
it would just arrive
at the other location

00:16:27.585 --> 00:16:29.970
at exactly the
time of that event.

00:16:29.970 --> 00:16:31.880
So the two events
could be joined

00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:34.500
by a light pulse that travels
at the speed of light.

00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:39.205
And that's the significance
of s squared being 0.

00:16:39.205 --> 00:16:39.955
OK, any questions?

00:16:42.910 --> 00:16:46.870
OK-- actually, I don't
want to that slide.

00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:48.990
We'll get back to that.

00:16:48.990 --> 00:16:52.320
OK, that finishes the
review of last lecture.

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:54.160
Now, what we want
to do is continue

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:56.000
talking about
spacetime intervals

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.520
and how we fit that into the
metric, which will ultimately

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:03.810
describe distances in
both space and time.

00:17:03.810 --> 00:17:08.055
So I'm going to work on the
blackboard for awhile now.

00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:35.494
So the formula that we're
starting with-- and we'll put

00:17:35.494 --> 00:17:42.210
dot dot dot here and minus c
squared tA minus tB squared.

00:17:42.210 --> 00:17:44.950
The dot dot dot means the
y term and the z term which

00:17:44.950 --> 00:17:48.870
you can probably imagine are
there without my writing them.

00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:53.970
From this expression, knowing
that what we want to do

00:17:53.970 --> 00:17:56.810
is to take advantage of these
geometrical ideas introduced

00:17:56.810 --> 00:18:02.440
by people like Gauss
which described distances

00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:04.080
in terms of
infinitesimal distances

00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:07.190
between infinitesimally
close points,

00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:09.300
we can write the
analogous equation

00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:12.010
for an infinitesimal distance.

00:18:12.010 --> 00:18:15.970
And that becomes ds
squared is equal to dx

00:18:15.970 --> 00:18:23.420
squared plus dy squared plus
dz squared minus c squared

00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:24.830
dt squared.

00:18:24.830 --> 00:18:27.280
So this would be the
Lorentz invariant separation

00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:29.432
between infinitesimally
separated events.

00:18:29.432 --> 00:18:30.890
And this is what
we're going to try

00:18:30.890 --> 00:18:33.995
to generalize to our
curved space situation.

00:18:37.850 --> 00:18:41.246
So this would be the metric
for special relativity.

00:18:41.246 --> 00:18:42.620
It's called the
Minkowsky metric.

00:18:57.590 --> 00:19:02.950
OK, now I want to move
into the general relativity

00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:11.000
generalization of this idea.

00:19:13.650 --> 00:19:16.940
And general relativity
makes use of the idea

00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:20.580
that Gauss originally suggested
that distances should always

00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:25.510
be quadratic functions of
the coordinate differentials.

00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:28.040
So we're going to keep that.

00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:29.260
Einstein kept that.

00:20:05.450 --> 00:20:08.290
Now, in talking about
coordinate differentials,

00:20:08.290 --> 00:20:12.240
we should emphasize here
that in general relativity,

00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:14.610
unlike special
relativity, coordinates

00:20:14.610 --> 00:20:19.479
are just arbitrary labels
for points in spacetime.

00:20:19.479 --> 00:20:21.270
In special relativity,
coordinates actually

00:20:21.270 --> 00:20:23.470
measure distances
and times directly,

00:20:23.470 --> 00:20:25.090
which is why the
metric is so simple.

00:20:25.090 --> 00:20:27.980
You don't really need the
metric in special relativity.

00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:29.820
The coordinates
themselves will tell you

00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:31.970
the distances and the times.

00:20:31.970 --> 00:20:35.190
But in general relativity,
that will not be the case.

00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:37.700
There's no way to do
that for a curved space

00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:40.120
or a curved spacetime.

00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:52.050
So in general relativity,
the coordinates

00:20:52.050 --> 00:21:00.190
are just arbitrary labels
of points in spacetime.

00:21:04.817 --> 00:21:06.650
And to know anything
about actual distances,

00:21:06.650 --> 00:21:08.696
you have to look at the metric.

00:21:08.696 --> 00:21:13.920
The coordinates themselves don't
tell you the actual distances.

00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:15.450
This immediately
implies something

00:21:15.450 --> 00:21:17.840
about the kinds of
coordinate transformations

00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:20.580
that you might want
to think about.

00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:24.210
In special relativity,
we have a privileged set

00:21:24.210 --> 00:21:28.550
of coordinates, namely the
coordinates of Lorentz frames,

00:21:28.550 --> 00:21:30.950
of inertial frames.

00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:34.030
And the physics is simple when
described in terms of those

00:21:34.030 --> 00:21:34.852
coordinates.

00:21:34.852 --> 00:21:36.560
In principle, you can
use any coordinates

00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:38.860
you want, even in
special relativity.

00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:42.560
But you never do, because the
physics is so much simpler

00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:44.730
in the inertial coordinates
that there's never

00:21:44.730 --> 00:21:49.230
any motivation for using any
other coordinate systems.

00:21:49.230 --> 00:21:50.810
But in general
relativity, there is

00:21:50.810 --> 00:21:52.890
no privileged coordinate system.

00:21:52.890 --> 00:21:56.570
And it's very common to make
all kinds of transformations

00:21:56.570 --> 00:22:00.390
of coordinates in the context
of general relativity.

00:22:00.390 --> 00:22:02.080
And the formalism
is set up so you

00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:04.980
could make any coordinate
transformation you want,

00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:07.460
and it's just thought
of as a relabeling

00:22:07.460 --> 00:22:09.930
of the points in space and time.

00:22:09.930 --> 00:22:12.330
And the formalism of
general relativity

00:22:12.330 --> 00:22:17.100
works for an arbitrary labeling
of points in spacetime.

00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:38.240
So in general relativity,
any coordinate transformation

00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:38.740
is allowed.

00:22:50.970 --> 00:22:55.274
But there's an
important feature of

00:22:55.274 --> 00:22:56.690
these coordinate
transformations--

00:22:56.690 --> 00:22:59.630
is that when we make a
coordinate transformation,

00:22:59.630 --> 00:23:05.180
we're always going to readjust
our metric so that ds squared

00:23:05.180 --> 00:23:08.720
between any two nearby
spacetime points

00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:10.400
has the same value
in the new coordinate

00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:12.250
system that it had in the old.

00:23:12.250 --> 00:23:15.265
We will always change
our metric to reflect

00:23:15.265 --> 00:23:16.390
our changes of coordinates.

00:23:28.940 --> 00:23:37.240
So ds squared must have the same
value in any coordinate system.

00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:55.180
So the statement
is that ds squared

00:23:55.180 --> 00:23:56.180
is coordinate-invariant.

00:24:33.310 --> 00:24:37.070
OK, to define what we mean by
ds squared, which if you notice,

00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:38.462
I haven't quite done yet.

00:24:38.462 --> 00:24:40.670
It's going to be, of course,
the analog of what we've

00:24:40.670 --> 00:24:43.580
been talking about in
special relativity.

00:24:43.580 --> 00:24:46.170
In special relativity, we
did have this special class

00:24:46.170 --> 00:24:49.920
of observers, inertial
observers, observers

00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:51.950
whose measurements
of length and time

00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:55.870
really corresponded
to the inertial frames

00:24:55.870 --> 00:24:58.880
and whose observations
are related to each other

00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:02.100
by Lorentz transformations.

00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:04.040
It's important to
start out by asking

00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:08.510
is there any class of
observers in general relativity

00:25:08.510 --> 00:25:11.100
which might play the same
roles-- the observers that

00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:15.150
sort of define the measurements
that you want to talk about.

00:25:15.150 --> 00:25:17.830
And it's clearly a little
bit more complicated

00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:20.700
in general relativity.

00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:23.390
The inertial observers
of special relativity

00:25:23.390 --> 00:25:25.280
are characterized
by the statement

00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:28.060
that there are no
forces acting on them.

00:25:28.060 --> 00:25:31.820
So they just travel at
a constant velocity.

00:25:31.820 --> 00:25:34.800
And you can always go to a
frame where that velocity is 0

00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:39.650
and you an talk about the rest
frame of any inertial observer.

00:25:39.650 --> 00:25:43.960
In general relativity,
we need to distinguish

00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:46.950
to some extent between
non-gravitational forces

00:25:46.950 --> 00:25:49.570
and gravitational forces.

00:25:49.570 --> 00:25:52.610
Non-gravitational forces,
like say, electrical forces,

00:25:52.610 --> 00:25:54.760
are treated in
general relativity

00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:57.980
in a way that's fundamentally
similar to the way

00:25:57.980 --> 00:26:01.450
that such forces are treated
in special relativity.

00:26:01.450 --> 00:26:03.730
But gravity is treated
totally differently.

00:26:03.730 --> 00:26:05.650
Gravity is really just
going to be described

00:26:05.650 --> 00:26:10.640
by the metric of spacetime--
by the distortion of spacetime.

00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:14.240
And we already know, by
way of simple examples,

00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:15.870
that if general
relativity actually

00:26:15.870 --> 00:26:18.510
works to describe the universe
that we've been talking-- which

00:26:18.510 --> 00:26:22.390
it'd better or we'd
be in trouble--

00:26:22.390 --> 00:26:23.810
we have a system
where if we just

00:26:23.810 --> 00:26:29.020
look at the co-moving observers,
each co-moving observer has

00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:32.180
no non-gravitational
forces acting on him.

00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:35.560
He's just sitting still
as far as he's concerned.

00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:37.890
But nonetheless, these
co-moving observers

00:26:37.890 --> 00:26:39.750
are accelerating
relative to each other

00:26:39.750 --> 00:26:42.950
as the universe expands and
as that expansion changes

00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:46.840
its expansion rate, which
we've already calculated.

00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:51.749
So if there's going to
be any observers that

00:26:51.749 --> 00:26:53.790
are going to play the role
of inertial observers,

00:26:53.790 --> 00:26:55.660
it's presumably going
to be a class that

00:26:55.660 --> 00:26:59.300
includes these
co-moving observers.

00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:01.590
And the question
of whether or not

00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:03.750
there are gravitational
forces acting

00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:07.500
on the co-moving
observers ends up

00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:09.640
depending on your point of view.

00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:11.500
Each co-moving
observer would think

00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:14.360
that there's no gravitational
forces acting on him.

00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:16.290
He would just be standing still.

00:27:16.290 --> 00:27:18.670
But he would see all these
other co-moving observers

00:27:18.670 --> 00:27:20.510
accelerating relative to him.

00:27:20.510 --> 00:27:23.510
So he would say that there are
gravitational forces acting

00:27:23.510 --> 00:27:27.790
on these other observers.

00:27:27.790 --> 00:27:31.540
So gravitational forces
in general activity

00:27:31.540 --> 00:27:36.540
becomes
coordinate-dependent ideas.

00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:39.060
And the Hubble
expansion is one example

00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:41.730
of that where every co-moving
observer would consider himself

00:27:41.730 --> 00:27:43.580
to be unaccelerating
but would see

00:27:43.580 --> 00:27:47.270
all the other co-moving
observers accelerating.

00:27:47.270 --> 00:27:50.280
The other famous
example, which is

00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:53.930
part of the original motivation
of general relativity,

00:27:53.930 --> 00:27:58.020
is the famous Einstein
elevator, which

00:27:58.020 --> 00:28:01.830
is also discussed
in Ryden's textbook.

00:28:01.830 --> 00:28:11.099
If we have an
elevator box, we could

00:28:11.099 --> 00:28:12.515
imagine letting
the elevator fall.

00:28:15.710 --> 00:28:19.410
There was a rope there,
but somebody cut it.

00:28:19.410 --> 00:28:21.150
And the elevator's now falling.

00:28:21.150 --> 00:28:22.290
And we have a person in it.

00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:30.210
And the person in my--
the version of the story

00:28:30.210 --> 00:28:32.050
that I have in
the lecture notes,

00:28:32.050 --> 00:28:35.550
the person's holding
a bag of groceries.

00:28:35.550 --> 00:28:39.410
And if the elevator
is falling freely

00:28:39.410 --> 00:28:43.100
and we ignore any air resistance
or any other kind of friction

00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:45.790
so the elevator's falling
at exactly the freefall

00:28:45.790 --> 00:28:48.970
rate, inside the
elevator, everything

00:28:48.970 --> 00:28:52.230
will be falling with
the same acceleration.

00:28:52.230 --> 00:28:55.680
The person could lift his
feet up off the floor,

00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:57.760
and he would just hover there.

00:28:57.760 --> 00:29:00.670
He would feel no gravity
pushing him towards the floor.

00:29:00.670 --> 00:29:03.650
And similarly, he could let
go of the bag of groceries,

00:29:03.650 --> 00:29:06.520
and they will just appear
to float in front of him

00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:09.330
as long as he's
undergoing this freefall.

00:29:09.330 --> 00:29:13.870
So the effects of gravity
have been completely removed.

00:29:13.870 --> 00:29:15.910
On the other hand, from
outside the elevator,

00:29:15.910 --> 00:29:17.964
if we use the frame of
reference of the Earth,

00:29:17.964 --> 00:29:19.380
we said that there
very definitely

00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:21.510
is a force of
gravity acting here.

00:29:21.510 --> 00:29:25.770
It's just acting the
same on all the objects.

00:29:25.770 --> 00:29:31.374
And this gets elevated into
the equivalence principle

00:29:31.374 --> 00:29:32.290
of general relativity.

00:29:40.770 --> 00:29:42.320
And maybe before
I annunciate that,

00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:45.930
I should consider
the other case here.

00:29:45.930 --> 00:29:49.580
This is one example
of how things work.

00:29:49.580 --> 00:29:57.680
A similar situation can
involve the same elevator,

00:29:57.680 --> 00:30:01.150
but this time,
let's have it just

00:30:01.150 --> 00:30:05.785
be sitting on the floor of the
building that it's located in.

00:30:05.785 --> 00:30:11.470
In that case, the
person inside would

00:30:11.470 --> 00:30:14.840
feel himself pushed against
the floor by gravity.

00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:17.190
If he was holding
his bag of groceries,

00:30:17.190 --> 00:30:20.370
he would notice he has to apply
force to the bag of groceries

00:30:20.370 --> 00:30:23.740
to stop the groceries
from falling to the floor.

00:30:23.740 --> 00:30:25.290
He would say that
he's being acted

00:30:25.290 --> 00:30:26.885
on by the force of gravity.

00:30:26.885 --> 00:30:29.520
That would be the
natural description.

00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:35.000
But we can consider
an analogous case

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:40.150
where we have the same elevator
in empty space with a rocket

00:30:40.150 --> 00:30:41.830
ship up here that I
didn't allow myself

00:30:41.830 --> 00:30:46.890
room to draw tied by
cables to the elevator.

00:30:51.410 --> 00:30:54.690
And if the rocket ship
accelerated with acceleration

00:30:54.690 --> 00:30:58.040
little g, the person
inside the elevator

00:30:58.040 --> 00:31:01.010
would feel himself pressed
against the floor in exactly

00:31:01.010 --> 00:31:03.410
the same way as you would here.

00:31:03.410 --> 00:31:06.060
So again, we have
a situation where

00:31:06.060 --> 00:31:09.250
there's gravity in one case and
no gravity in the other case,

00:31:09.250 --> 00:31:13.370
but no difference in what
the person inside would feel.

00:31:13.370 --> 00:31:36.500
And that is what becomes this
principle of equivalence, which

00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:46.800
says that the physics
of the accelerating

00:31:46.800 --> 00:32:07.100
frame of the elevator in
that analogy-- so this

00:32:07.100 --> 00:32:22.520
is accelerating frame
but with no gravity--

00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:43.950
is equivalent to feeling
the gravitational field

00:32:43.950 --> 00:32:44.620
of the Earth.

00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:54.520
In short, if you were
living inside the elevator,

00:32:54.520 --> 00:32:58.080
you cannot tell which of those
two pictures describe the world

00:32:58.080 --> 00:33:00.350
that you're actually part of.

00:33:00.350 --> 00:33:01.780
And this is a very
deep principle.

00:33:01.780 --> 00:33:03.610
It has very strong implications.

00:33:03.610 --> 00:33:05.490
It really does mean
that everything

00:33:05.490 --> 00:33:08.310
you'd ever want to know
about how gravity affects

00:33:08.310 --> 00:33:12.540
physical systems can be
described by understanding how

00:33:12.540 --> 00:33:15.660
accelerations affect
the physical systems.

00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:17.510
So it reduces the
questions of what gravity

00:33:17.510 --> 00:33:20.120
does to just understanding
what happens when you're

00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:21.700
in an accelerating
coordinate system.

00:33:27.050 --> 00:33:30.070
OK, this also opens the
door for the question

00:33:30.070 --> 00:33:33.340
I began with-- is there a
special class of observers

00:33:33.340 --> 00:33:35.000
here?

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:38.870
And we can identify a
special class of observers.

00:33:38.870 --> 00:33:41.150
But the special class
is not observers

00:33:41.150 --> 00:33:42.900
which have no forces
acting on them, which

00:33:42.900 --> 00:33:45.580
is what we would have said
in special relativity.

00:33:45.580 --> 00:33:47.850
But rather, the
special observers

00:33:47.850 --> 00:33:51.820
are the observers who have no
non-gravitational forces acting

00:33:51.820 --> 00:33:54.930
on them, like the
co-moving observers

00:33:54.930 --> 00:33:57.490
in our model of the universe.

00:33:57.490 --> 00:33:59.220
But gravitational
forces, you could never

00:33:59.220 --> 00:34:02.170
say if they're there
or not because they're

00:34:02.170 --> 00:34:06.610
always there in some frames
and not there in other frames.

00:34:06.610 --> 00:34:09.659
So we have no control
or no way of making

00:34:09.659 --> 00:34:13.909
any frame-invariant statements
about the force of gravity.

00:34:13.909 --> 00:34:18.460
So what we'll be interested
in as our primary observers

00:34:18.460 --> 00:34:22.350
and which we're going
to use to define things

00:34:22.350 --> 00:34:29.461
in this class of observers with
no non-gravitational forces--

00:34:29.461 --> 00:34:31.460
and those will be called
free-falling observers.

00:35:09.230 --> 00:35:11.790
And they're called
free-falling because you

00:35:11.790 --> 00:35:14.350
have no way of knowing
whether they're just observers

00:35:14.350 --> 00:35:16.170
for which there is
no gravity, which

00:35:16.170 --> 00:35:18.540
would be an example of
a free-falling observer

00:35:18.540 --> 00:35:20.030
by our definition.

00:35:20.030 --> 00:35:23.640
But the situation
is indistinguishable

00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:25.630
from this one,
where free-falling

00:35:25.630 --> 00:35:28.250
has its obvious meaning--
that the guy there

00:35:28.250 --> 00:35:30.761
is falling relative
to the Earth's frame.

00:35:30.761 --> 00:35:31.760
But he's freely falling.

00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:35.210
And therefore, he does not feel,
relative to his environment,

00:35:35.210 --> 00:35:38.009
any forces whatever.

00:35:38.009 --> 00:35:40.300
Now, I should emphasize that
this equivalence principle

00:35:40.300 --> 00:35:41.900
holds only in small regions.

00:35:41.900 --> 00:35:45.010
In principle, it only holds
in infinitesimal regions

00:35:45.010 --> 00:35:48.560
because there are, in
gravitational systems, what

00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:51.419
we call tidal effects,
where a tidal effect simply

00:35:51.419 --> 00:35:53.210
means that the
gravitational field is never

00:35:53.210 --> 00:35:54.464
completely uniform.

00:35:54.464 --> 00:35:56.380
And if the gravitational
field is not uniform,

00:35:56.380 --> 00:35:59.320
you do not completely cancel it
by going into the accelerating

00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:00.650
frame of the elevator.

00:36:00.650 --> 00:36:02.290
But in any infinitesimal
region, you

00:36:02.290 --> 00:36:05.000
can always cancel the
effects of gravity

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:07.590
by going into a properly
accelerating frame.

00:36:07.590 --> 00:36:10.396
And that's what the
equivalence principle says.

00:36:10.396 --> 00:36:12.020
OK, are there any
questions about that?

00:36:16.580 --> 00:36:21.120
OK, this being said-- it was
a long prelude-- we can now

00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:23.975
define what ds squared
is supposed to represent.

00:36:27.950 --> 00:36:41.960
And the answer is simply that ds
squared has the same meaning as

00:36:41.960 --> 00:37:06.170
in special relativity except
that inertial observers are

00:37:06.170 --> 00:37:08.450
replaced by
free-falling observers.

00:37:32.970 --> 00:37:35.320
OK, so let's review
what exactly that means.

00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:38.804
It means that if ds
squared is positive,

00:37:38.804 --> 00:37:40.220
it means that there
will always be

00:37:40.220 --> 00:37:45.610
a class of free-falling
observers for whom those two

00:37:45.610 --> 00:37:50.740
events will occur
at the same time.

00:37:50.740 --> 00:37:53.210
And ds squared will be the
distance between those two

00:37:53.210 --> 00:37:56.270
events as measured by those
inertial observers-- bah,

00:37:56.270 --> 00:37:58.370
I said "inertial"--
free-falling observers.

00:38:01.330 --> 00:38:04.602
And similarly, if ds
squared is negative,

00:38:04.602 --> 00:38:06.935
it means there will be a class
of free-falling observers

00:38:06.935 --> 00:38:10.040
for whom those two events will
occur at the same location.

00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:14.100
And ds squared will measure, up
to a factor of minus c squared,

00:38:14.100 --> 00:38:18.150
the time separation squared
between those two events.

00:38:18.150 --> 00:38:21.114
And it will again be the
case that if ds squared is 0,

00:38:21.114 --> 00:38:23.030
it will mean that the
two events are separated

00:38:23.030 --> 00:38:25.312
by just the right distance
so that a light pulse can

00:38:25.312 --> 00:38:26.520
travel from one to the other.

00:38:31.150 --> 00:38:33.990
OK, any questions about that?

00:38:33.990 --> 00:38:35.740
It's was kind of a
long-winded discussion.

00:38:35.740 --> 00:38:36.950
But I think it does
pay to actually

00:38:36.950 --> 00:38:39.570
understand what df ds means
rather than just to write down

00:38:39.570 --> 00:38:41.940
a formula for it and say
that's like special relativity.

00:38:45.050 --> 00:38:48.460
OK, having said all
this, our next goal

00:38:48.460 --> 00:38:55.370
is to figure out how time enters
the Robertson-Walker metric

00:38:55.370 --> 00:38:57.260
to give us a spacetime
metric instead

00:38:57.260 --> 00:39:01.720
of just a spatial metric, which
we already have written down.

00:39:01.720 --> 00:39:03.420
And I'm going to
write down the answer

00:39:03.420 --> 00:39:06.110
and then describe why that
has to be the right answer.

00:39:06.110 --> 00:39:08.980
I think it's the easiest
way to handle it here.

00:39:08.980 --> 00:39:12.950
So the right answer is that when
we incorporate time and think

00:39:12.950 --> 00:39:14.790
of this as a metric
for spacetime,

00:39:14.790 --> 00:39:20.420
ds squared is going to be
minus c squared dt squared

00:39:20.420 --> 00:39:28.800
plus a squared of t
times dr squared over 1

00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:33.130
minus k r squared-- right now,
it's just the same spatial part

00:39:33.130 --> 00:39:37.970
that we had before-- plus
r squared d theta squared

00:39:37.970 --> 00:39:43.900
plus sine squared
theta d phi squared.

00:39:43.900 --> 00:39:45.410
End parentheses.

00:39:45.410 --> 00:39:48.160
End curly brackets.

00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:50.100
So all I've done is
I've added a minus

00:39:50.100 --> 00:39:56.670
c squared dt squared
term to the metric.

00:39:56.670 --> 00:40:00.525
Now, why is this
the right metric?

00:40:00.525 --> 00:40:03.810
I'm going to first consider
two special cases, which

00:40:03.810 --> 00:40:06.970
will verify some
of the terms there.

00:40:06.970 --> 00:40:08.980
And then I want to
also discuss why

00:40:08.980 --> 00:40:11.410
there aren't any other
terms besides the ones

00:40:11.410 --> 00:40:13.890
that we know have to be there.

00:40:13.890 --> 00:40:22.240
So first, let's just consider
the case-- case one will just

00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:26.080
be dt equals 0.

00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:29.010
If there's no time separation
between the two events,

00:40:29.010 --> 00:40:31.600
then we're only interested
in spatial separations.

00:40:31.600 --> 00:40:33.125
And we've already
talked about how

00:40:33.125 --> 00:40:35.260
to describe spatial
separations in a way which

00:40:35.260 --> 00:40:39.040
makes the description
homogeneous and isotropic.

00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:41.630
And we said that this is the
most general way of describing

00:40:41.630 --> 00:40:44.630
spatial separations that
are in a space which

00:40:44.630 --> 00:40:47.180
is homogeneous and isotropic.

00:40:47.180 --> 00:40:52.680
So from what we said previously,
this has to be the answer.

00:40:52.680 --> 00:40:55.810
That's how we describe
homogeneous isotropic spaces.

00:40:55.810 --> 00:40:57.590
So when dt vanishes,
it just reduces

00:40:57.590 --> 00:40:59.470
to the case we've
already discussed.

00:40:59.470 --> 00:41:01.770
Simple enough.

00:41:01.770 --> 00:41:06.300
Case two, which involves a
little bit of new thinking--

00:41:06.300 --> 00:41:10.730
suppose dr equals d
theta equals d phi

00:41:10.730 --> 00:41:15.568
equals 0 so that
only time changes.

00:41:15.568 --> 00:41:19.470
OK, this describes the situation
about our co-moving observers.

00:41:19.470 --> 00:41:22.450
They're sitting at fixed
spatial coordinates

00:41:22.450 --> 00:41:24.920
and evolving in time.

00:41:24.920 --> 00:41:30.220
And we've already said that the
thing that we call cosmic time

00:41:30.220 --> 00:41:32.940
is simply time as
measured by the wrist

00:41:32.940 --> 00:41:36.440
watches of our
co-moving observers.

00:41:36.440 --> 00:41:39.220
So t, if you want t to
be cosmic time, which

00:41:39.220 --> 00:41:42.980
we do-- we're trying to describe
a metric for our spacetime

00:41:42.980 --> 00:41:44.430
as we've already described it.

00:41:44.430 --> 00:41:46.460
We're now just trying to
write a metric for it.

00:41:46.460 --> 00:41:48.550
So t should be cosmic time.

00:41:48.550 --> 00:41:50.870
So t should be the
time as measured

00:41:50.870 --> 00:41:54.700
on the wrist watches of
the co-moving observers.

00:41:54.700 --> 00:41:57.650
And that's exactly
what this metric says.

00:41:57.650 --> 00:42:01.550
It says that if
ds squared defines

00:42:01.550 --> 00:42:04.930
the measurements of our
free-falling observers, which

00:42:04.930 --> 00:42:09.570
is what we said is the
definition of ds squared,

00:42:09.570 --> 00:42:11.820
that it is just equal
to minus c squared

00:42:11.820 --> 00:42:15.040
times the change in
the coordinate time.

00:42:15.040 --> 00:42:16.670
And coordinate time
means cosmic time

00:42:16.670 --> 00:42:19.270
because that's the coordinate
system we're using.

00:42:19.270 --> 00:42:21.380
So putting in the
minus c squared

00:42:21.380 --> 00:42:25.190
dt squared term is the
only way that it can be so

00:42:25.190 --> 00:42:29.400
that the wrist watches of
our co-moving, free-falling

00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:34.610
observers measure the same thing
that the coordinate measures,

00:42:34.610 --> 00:42:38.130
which is what we defined cosmic
time to be in the first place.

00:42:38.130 --> 00:42:40.090
So I think that
justifies this term.

00:42:40.090 --> 00:42:42.370
And notice, if you had
any coefficient here other

00:42:42.370 --> 00:42:45.240
than c squared, there'd
be a multiplicity

00:42:45.240 --> 00:42:48.020
offset between what the wrist
watches of your observers

00:42:48.020 --> 00:42:51.590
are measuring and what
cosmic time is ticking off.

00:42:51.590 --> 00:42:55.110
And we're not allowing that,
because we define cosmic time

00:42:55.110 --> 00:42:57.460
to be the time measured
by the wrist watches.

00:43:00.140 --> 00:43:03.220
OK, so that takes care
of these two cases.

00:43:03.220 --> 00:43:05.170
And I think it implies
that these terms have

00:43:05.170 --> 00:43:08.730
to be here in exactly the
form that we've written.

00:43:08.730 --> 00:43:10.170
And we could stop
now and pretend

00:43:10.170 --> 00:43:12.300
that we've solved
the whole problem.

00:43:12.300 --> 00:43:17.590
But I always like to be what
I consider to be thorough.

00:43:17.590 --> 00:43:20.150
So I like to sort of
imagine the questions that

00:43:20.150 --> 00:43:23.800
could pop up if people
were inquisitive.

00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:28.030
So you might imagine that you
have some difficult roommate

00:43:28.030 --> 00:43:31.070
who says, why can't I
put some other term,

00:43:31.070 --> 00:43:34.055
and what else could there be?

00:43:34.055 --> 00:43:35.680
The only thing that
we've left out here

00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:39.300
are terms that
involve products of dt

00:43:39.300 --> 00:43:41.475
with either dr, d
theta, or d phi.

00:43:50.150 --> 00:43:53.790
So what about terms like
the product of dr times

00:43:53.790 --> 00:43:59.955
dt or d theta times
dt or d phi times dt?

00:44:06.830 --> 00:44:07.850
Question mark.

00:44:11.357 --> 00:44:13.190
So one possible answer
is I looked in a book

00:44:13.190 --> 00:44:15.211
and it wasn't there.

00:44:15.211 --> 00:44:17.210
But that's not the best
of all possible answers.

00:44:17.210 --> 00:44:18.626
It's good to
understand why things

00:44:18.626 --> 00:44:21.180
are in books and why
other things or not.

00:44:21.180 --> 00:44:23.870
So you might want to
construct an argument of why

00:44:23.870 --> 00:44:25.730
these terms have to be absent.

00:44:25.730 --> 00:44:29.850
And the reason why those
terms have to be absent

00:44:29.850 --> 00:44:33.629
is because if they were there,
they would violate isotropy.

00:44:33.629 --> 00:44:35.420
Roughly speaking, the
notion is that if you

00:44:35.420 --> 00:44:38.630
have a dt times some
d spatial coordinate,

00:44:38.630 --> 00:44:41.020
that singles out a certain
direction in spatial

00:44:41.020 --> 00:44:48.310
coordinates space because dr
is not the same as minus dr. Dr

00:44:48.310 --> 00:44:50.790
points in a certain direction.

00:44:50.790 --> 00:44:55.410
To be more explicit
about that, in the notes,

00:44:55.410 --> 00:45:00.000
I discuss a thought
experiment which basically

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:06.479
gives a concrete
realization of the asymmetry

00:45:06.479 --> 00:45:07.395
that I just discussed.

00:45:24.290 --> 00:45:28.990
So to see how those terms
explicitly violate isotropy,

00:45:28.990 --> 00:45:31.600
we can imagine a
thought experiment

00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:36.170
where we start by thinking about
some particular point in space.

00:45:36.170 --> 00:45:38.830
And we'll give it coordinates
r, theta, and phi.

00:45:38.830 --> 00:45:42.420
And I'll assume r is non-zero.

00:45:42.420 --> 00:45:46.790
We could then imagine that two
people sitting at this point--

00:45:46.790 --> 00:45:48.890
and in the Lewis Carroll
spirit, I call them

00:45:48.890 --> 00:45:52.730
Tweedledee and
Tweedledum-- can decide

00:45:52.730 --> 00:45:56.649
to do an experiment by first
synchronizing their clocks.

00:45:56.649 --> 00:45:58.690
And they might as well
synchronize t cosmic time,

00:45:58.690 --> 00:46:00.310
let's say.

00:46:00.310 --> 00:46:05.060
And then, one of them can go off
in the direction of positive r,

00:46:05.060 --> 00:46:08.800
and the other can go off in
the direction of negative r

00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:12.290
at the same coordinate
velocity, which I'll call v.

00:46:12.290 --> 00:46:14.200
And by coordinate
velocity, I mean dr dt,

00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:16.610
because that's the simplest
thing to talk about here.

00:46:16.610 --> 00:46:18.651
It many not be the same
as the physical velocity,

00:46:18.651 --> 00:46:19.510
but we don't care.

00:46:19.510 --> 00:46:22.000
It'll be the same
for both of them.

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:25.970
And the experiment will be
that they will each travel

00:46:25.970 --> 00:46:29.900
until there's some-- until
cosmic time-- they're

00:46:29.900 --> 00:46:33.440
passing a lot of cosmic
time clocks as they travel.

00:46:33.440 --> 00:46:36.280
And they agree to travel
until cosmic time ticks off

00:46:36.280 --> 00:46:39.490
until some chosen final time.

00:46:39.490 --> 00:46:41.950
And when they each
finish the experiment

00:46:41.950 --> 00:46:45.882
by noticing that the cosmic
time clocks now read t sub f,

00:46:45.882 --> 00:46:47.340
they will look at
their own watches

00:46:47.340 --> 00:46:49.450
and see how much time elapsed.

00:46:49.450 --> 00:46:52.100
So they're basically
measuring time dilation--

00:46:52.100 --> 00:46:54.920
how do their wrist watch
times, when they move,

00:46:54.920 --> 00:46:58.900
differ from cosmic time.

00:46:58.900 --> 00:47:04.530
And the point is that if we
have a dr dt term in the metric,

00:47:04.530 --> 00:47:07.240
these people get
different values

00:47:07.240 --> 00:47:09.550
because the time
that they measure

00:47:09.550 --> 00:47:11.520
will be what they
call ds squared,

00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:13.720
up to a factor of
minus c squared.

00:47:13.720 --> 00:47:29.550
And that will include
this dt dr term.

00:47:32.500 --> 00:47:39.930
And dr for one of them will
be the coordinate velocity

00:47:39.930 --> 00:47:48.420
they chose times d cosmic
time, the amount of cosmic time

00:47:48.420 --> 00:47:49.740
interval they travel for.

00:47:49.740 --> 00:47:52.870
They've agreed on that
before they take off.

00:47:52.870 --> 00:47:56.710
And for the other, dr
will be negative vc times

00:47:56.710 --> 00:47:59.520
dt, so cosmic.

00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:05.540
So this term will give
a different contribution

00:48:05.540 --> 00:48:09.550
to the ds squared that each of
these two entities, Tweedledee

00:48:09.550 --> 00:48:11.400
and Tweedledum, will measure.

00:48:11.400 --> 00:48:13.400
And therefore, they'll
be measuring different ds

00:48:13.400 --> 00:48:15.240
squareds, and that means they'll
be measuring different things

00:48:15.240 --> 00:48:16.630
on their wrist watches.

00:48:16.630 --> 00:48:19.940
And that means they have
an asymmetry in directions.

00:48:19.940 --> 00:48:21.640
By going one direction
or the other,

00:48:21.640 --> 00:48:23.940
they could determine
whether their time dilation

00:48:23.940 --> 00:48:26.770
will be increased or decreased.

00:48:26.770 --> 00:48:29.520
And that, if our
universe is isotopic,

00:48:29.520 --> 00:48:31.100
should not be possible.

00:48:31.100 --> 00:48:34.070
And therefore, if we want to
write a metric which describes

00:48:34.070 --> 00:48:40.840
an isotropic universe, we
have to omit the dr dt term.

00:48:40.840 --> 00:48:42.830
And a completely
identical argument

00:48:42.830 --> 00:48:45.930
implies that we have to also
omit d theta dt and d phi dt.

00:48:54.840 --> 00:49:05.685
So isotropy implies dt
dr term is not allowed.

00:49:08.900 --> 00:49:13.940
Because otherwise, we would have
a Tweedledee Tweedledum time

00:49:13.940 --> 00:49:15.860
dilation asymmetry,
which we're not

00:49:15.860 --> 00:49:17.490
allowed to have an
isotropic universe.

00:49:21.232 --> 00:49:22.440
OK, any questions about that?

00:49:28.944 --> 00:49:30.610
OK, if you have no
questions about that,

00:49:30.610 --> 00:49:33.740
now we're ready to go
onto our next topic.

00:49:33.740 --> 00:49:43.370
Now that we've described
the metric of our universe,

00:49:43.370 --> 00:49:45.880
there it is-- the full
Robertson-Walker spacetime

00:49:45.880 --> 00:49:51.180
metric for a homogeneous
and isotropic universe.

00:49:51.180 --> 00:49:55.160
The next thing I'd like to about
is how do we calculate motion

00:49:55.160 --> 00:49:58.290
in a metric in the context
of general relativity.

00:49:58.290 --> 00:50:00.900
And our treatment here
will be completely general.

00:50:00.900 --> 00:50:04.300
We'll learn how to calculate
motion in an arbitrary metric.

00:50:04.300 --> 00:50:06.350
And we'll in fact use
the Schwarzschild metric,

00:50:06.350 --> 00:50:09.510
which describes spherically
symmetric objects like stars

00:50:09.510 --> 00:50:12.030
or even black holes
as an example.

00:50:15.350 --> 00:50:17.889
But our real purpose
is to understand things

00:50:17.889 --> 00:50:19.055
like motion in the universe.

00:50:22.830 --> 00:50:31.240
And I guess at this point, I
am going to-- load up screen.

00:50:31.240 --> 00:50:32.232
OK, good.

00:51:11.990 --> 00:51:17.390
OK, I'm going to just use the
equations from the lecture

00:51:17.390 --> 00:51:17.890
notes.

00:51:20.950 --> 00:51:22.500
This particular
calculation involves

00:51:22.500 --> 00:51:25.630
a lot of long
equations, so I think

00:51:25.630 --> 00:51:29.020
doing it on the blackboard would
probably be a bit too tedious.

00:51:29.020 --> 00:51:31.230
So I'm instead going to
just lift the equations

00:51:31.230 --> 00:51:33.660
and talk about them directly
from the lecture notes

00:51:33.660 --> 00:51:35.250
themselves.

00:51:35.250 --> 00:51:37.070
So what we're interested
in is thinking

00:51:37.070 --> 00:51:41.320
about a geodesic in
some arbitrary metric.

00:51:41.320 --> 00:51:44.150
And we're going to start with
the simplest possible example

00:51:44.150 --> 00:51:48.420
of the two dimensional spatial
metric of the same kind

00:51:48.420 --> 00:51:51.300
of spaces that Gauss and
Bolyai and Lobachevsky

00:51:51.300 --> 00:51:55.930
were talking about using
this notation of differential

00:51:55.930 --> 00:52:00.400
geometry of thinking of a metric
in terms of coordinates, which

00:52:00.400 --> 00:52:04.150
in this case, we'll
initially call x and y.

00:52:04.150 --> 00:52:08.190
It will generalize perfectly
straightforwardly to spacetimes

00:52:08.190 --> 00:52:10.700
because all the
ideas are the same.

00:52:10.700 --> 00:52:14.450
But it's easiest to start out
by thinking about you're simply

00:52:14.450 --> 00:52:16.480
talking about
measuring distances

00:52:16.480 --> 00:52:19.710
in a two dimensional space.

00:52:19.710 --> 00:52:26.240
A geodesic is defined as a line
between two points in space

00:52:26.240 --> 00:52:28.760
which has the property that
the length of that line

00:52:28.760 --> 00:52:31.520
is stationary with
respect to any variations.

00:52:31.520 --> 00:52:34.350
Stationary means the
first derivative vanishes.

00:52:34.350 --> 00:52:36.490
Now, in this two
dimensional space example,

00:52:36.490 --> 00:52:40.350
our stationary lines will
also always be minima.

00:52:40.350 --> 00:52:42.820
That is, you can minimize the
distance between two points

00:52:42.820 --> 00:52:44.830
by finding the
shortest possible line.

00:52:44.830 --> 00:52:47.125
There is no longest
possible line.

00:52:47.125 --> 00:52:49.500
And there aren't any saddle
points either, I don't think.

00:52:49.500 --> 00:52:51.850
So I think in this
case the minima--

00:52:51.850 --> 00:52:54.632
the stationary points will
always be minimum I believe.

00:52:54.632 --> 00:52:56.590
But in general, when we
have spacetime metrics,

00:52:56.590 --> 00:53:00.090
especially when things are
not even positive definite,

00:53:00.090 --> 00:53:02.790
these geodesics, the
stationary lines,

00:53:02.790 --> 00:53:06.140
can be either maxima or
minima or saddle points.

00:53:06.140 --> 00:53:11.610
So you should imagine that all
those possibilities are there.

00:53:11.610 --> 00:53:13.165
However, the
equations we'll derive

00:53:13.165 --> 00:53:14.540
will really just
be the equations

00:53:14.540 --> 00:53:17.419
that say that the first
order difference vanishes.

00:53:17.419 --> 00:53:19.460
If you vary the path a
little bit to first order,

00:53:19.460 --> 00:53:21.080
the length does not change.

00:53:21.080 --> 00:53:24.350
And that will be true for
maxima, minima, or saddle

00:53:24.350 --> 00:53:24.850
points.

00:53:24.850 --> 00:53:29.020
We won't have to care in
deriving the equations.

00:53:29.020 --> 00:53:31.120
So we start by imagining
a metric like that.

00:53:34.170 --> 00:53:35.545
And the first
thing we want to do

00:53:35.545 --> 00:53:39.360
is just adopt a better
notation for the metric.

00:53:39.360 --> 00:53:42.070
And there are two improvements.

00:53:42.070 --> 00:53:44.380
The first is to
number the coordinates

00:53:44.380 --> 00:53:46.770
instead of thinking of
them as different letters.

00:53:46.770 --> 00:53:49.120
So instead of talking
about x and y,

00:53:49.120 --> 00:53:53.860
we're going to talk about
x super one and x super 2.

00:53:53.860 --> 00:53:55.670
Now, these 1's and
2's have the danger

00:53:55.670 --> 00:53:57.860
of possibly being
confused with a power.

00:53:57.860 --> 00:53:59.890
We probably never write
x to the first power,

00:53:59.890 --> 00:54:03.410
but you might write x super 2
and think of if as x squared.

00:54:03.410 --> 00:54:05.530
Many times we, of
course, do that.

00:54:05.530 --> 00:54:08.640
So one always has to hope that
the context will make it clear

00:54:08.640 --> 00:54:12.290
what that index refers to.

00:54:12.290 --> 00:54:16.660
But here, these upper index
objects-- those superscripts

00:54:16.660 --> 00:54:17.850
are just indices.

00:54:17.850 --> 00:54:20.450
They're not powers.

00:54:20.450 --> 00:54:23.372
You might wonder why we tolerate
such a crazy notation when

00:54:23.372 --> 00:54:25.080
we could have written
them as subscripts.

00:54:25.080 --> 00:54:27.286
And then there would
not be this confusion.

00:54:27.286 --> 00:54:29.160
But the answer is that
in general relativity,

00:54:29.160 --> 00:54:31.368
one does make use of both
subscripts and superscripts

00:54:31.368 --> 00:54:33.070
in a slightly different way.

00:54:33.070 --> 00:54:36.280
And to some extent, you'll see
that in what we'll be doing.

00:54:36.280 --> 00:54:37.860
So it's useful in
general relativity

00:54:37.860 --> 00:54:41.650
to have two kinds of scripts.

00:54:41.650 --> 00:54:44.290
And the only places that seem
to exist are up and down.

00:54:44.290 --> 00:54:46.930
So they're superscripts
and subscripts.

00:54:46.930 --> 00:54:48.760
And one simply
hopes that there's

00:54:48.760 --> 00:54:51.390
no confusion with powers.

00:54:51.390 --> 00:54:54.640
OK, so step one is
number your indices

00:54:54.640 --> 00:54:57.140
and to number your coordinates.

00:54:57.140 --> 00:54:59.872
And then instead of writing
that the sum of three terms

00:54:59.872 --> 00:55:02.080
that we had-- and of course,
it gets to be much more.

00:55:02.080 --> 00:55:06.550
If you have four coordinates, it
would be 16 terms or 10 terms,

00:55:06.550 --> 00:55:09.245
depending on how
you collected them.

00:55:09.245 --> 00:55:10.620
But instead of
writing that mess,

00:55:10.620 --> 00:55:12.890
you can write it using
the summation notation.

00:55:12.890 --> 00:55:16.163
Sum from i equals 1 to
2, sum j equals 1 to 2

00:55:16.163 --> 00:55:23.490
of g sub ij of the
x-coordinates times dx i dx j.

00:55:23.490 --> 00:55:26.300
And when you sum over i and j,
you're summing over 1 and 2,

00:55:26.300 --> 00:55:28.210
which means you're
summing over x and y.

00:55:28.210 --> 00:55:29.810
And the sum includes
the x, x term,

00:55:29.810 --> 00:55:31.550
which is now called
the 1, 1 term.

00:55:31.550 --> 00:55:33.300
And the y, y term
which is now called

00:55:33.300 --> 00:55:36.380
the 2, 2 term,
and the x, y term,

00:55:36.380 --> 00:55:38.627
which is now called the
1, 2 or the 2, 1 term.

00:55:38.627 --> 00:55:40.210
And those are identical
to each other.

00:55:40.210 --> 00:55:43.220
And they just get added.

00:55:43.220 --> 00:55:45.780
So that shortens the
notation considerably.

00:55:45.780 --> 00:55:48.140
But then there's one
further simplification

00:55:48.140 --> 00:55:50.360
that was actually introduced
by Einstein himself.

00:55:50.360 --> 00:55:54.640
And it's always called the
Einstein summation convention.

00:55:54.640 --> 00:55:58.010
Notice that in this
equation, the letter i

00:55:58.010 --> 00:56:01.180
appears twice as an
index-- as an upper index

00:56:01.180 --> 00:56:05.390
there and as a lower index
on the metric, g sub ij.

00:56:05.390 --> 00:56:09.360
And the Einstein
convention is that whenever

00:56:09.360 --> 00:56:13.690
you have a repeated index where
one is upper and one is lower,

00:56:13.690 --> 00:56:16.490
you automatically sum over them
without writing the summation

00:56:16.490 --> 00:56:17.340
sign.

00:56:17.340 --> 00:56:20.200
The summation sign is implied.

00:56:20.200 --> 00:56:22.862
So then this equation get
simplified to that equation,

00:56:22.862 --> 00:56:24.820
which is the form that
we'll actually be using.

00:56:24.820 --> 00:56:28.450
And that's as about
as simple as it gets.

00:56:28.450 --> 00:56:30.055
OK, so far, that's
just notation.

00:56:34.509 --> 00:56:36.050
OK, now what we want
to do is to talk

00:56:36.050 --> 00:56:38.140
about a path between two points.

00:56:38.140 --> 00:56:40.879
And we want to discuss how
we're going to describe the path

00:56:40.879 --> 00:56:43.420
and how we're going to derive
the equations that will tell us

00:56:43.420 --> 00:56:45.810
that this path has the
minimum possible length, which

00:56:45.810 --> 00:56:47.220
is what we're trying to do.

00:56:47.220 --> 00:56:49.250
We're trying to find the
equations that tell us

00:56:49.250 --> 00:56:54.340
when a path has an extreme
value of the length.

00:56:54.340 --> 00:56:57.030
So to describe the
path itself, we're

00:56:57.030 --> 00:56:59.450
going to imagine
parameterizing it, which

00:56:59.450 --> 00:57:02.940
means we're going to think
of a function xi of lambda,

00:57:02.940 --> 00:57:05.200
where xi-- remember,
xi means 1 and 2.

00:57:05.200 --> 00:57:08.840
It means specifying one both x
and y as a function of lambda.

00:57:08.840 --> 00:57:12.070
So this is really two
functions of lambda.

00:57:12.070 --> 00:57:15.270
And this function
of lambda is going

00:57:15.270 --> 00:57:19.700
to show us how the point
that traces out this path

00:57:19.700 --> 00:57:23.640
varies from point A
to point B. And we'll

00:57:23.640 --> 00:57:25.850
allow it to vary as a
function of this parameter

00:57:25.850 --> 00:57:27.750
that we've introduced, lambda.

00:57:27.750 --> 00:57:29.500
And we'll adopt the
convention that lambda

00:57:29.500 --> 00:57:33.770
is 0 at one end and lambda
sub f at the other end.

00:57:33.770 --> 00:57:38.310
So xi of 0 will be required to
be the coordinates of point A

00:57:38.310 --> 00:57:40.690
If we want to start at
some specified point A,

00:57:40.690 --> 00:57:43.100
we want to end up at
some specified point B.

00:57:43.100 --> 00:57:46.150
So we'll insist that the
coordinates evaluated at lambda

00:57:46.150 --> 00:57:51.050
sub f are xi sub B. And
as long as xi of lambda

00:57:51.050 --> 00:57:54.810
is a continuous function,
which we will also insist on,

00:57:54.810 --> 00:57:58.756
then xi of lambda will describe
a path from A to B, which

00:57:58.756 --> 00:57:59.880
is what we're trying to do.

00:58:03.400 --> 00:58:07.460
OK, to apply the
metric and write down

00:58:07.460 --> 00:58:09.210
an expression for the
length of this path,

00:58:09.210 --> 00:58:10.501
that's what we want to do next.

00:58:10.501 --> 00:58:13.160
And then we want to
figure how to extremize

00:58:13.160 --> 00:58:15.120
that expression for the length.

00:58:15.120 --> 00:58:17.985
First step, we need to get
an expression for the length.

00:58:17.985 --> 00:58:19.360
So the metric is
written in terms

00:58:19.360 --> 00:58:21.470
of infinitesimal separations.

00:58:21.470 --> 00:58:23.950
So we want to imagine
dividing this path up

00:58:23.950 --> 00:58:28.887
into little segments, each
corresponding to some d lambda.

00:58:28.887 --> 00:58:31.220
Each little segment goes from
some lambda to some lambda

00:58:31.220 --> 00:58:35.060
plus d lambda, where d
lambda is infinitesimal.

00:58:35.060 --> 00:58:38.720
And the change in the
coordinates over that interval

00:58:38.720 --> 00:58:40.850
are then just the
derivative of xi

00:58:40.850 --> 00:58:42.360
with respect to
lambda-- remember,

00:58:42.360 --> 00:58:46.664
we have this function, xi
of lambda-- times d lambda.

00:58:46.664 --> 00:58:48.080
This will give us
the differential

00:58:48.080 --> 00:58:50.570
coordinates between
any two neighboring

00:58:50.570 --> 00:58:53.890
points along the line.

00:58:53.890 --> 00:58:57.020
Then ds squared is
defined in terms of d xi.

00:58:57.020 --> 00:59:00.270
And we just plug this
formula into the expression

00:59:00.270 --> 00:59:03.990
for ds squared in terms of
the infinitesimal separations.

00:59:03.990 --> 00:59:05.620
So we have the metric.

00:59:05.620 --> 00:59:08.490
And then where we had
previously just d xi,

00:59:08.490 --> 00:59:12.170
now we have d xi d
lambda times d lambda.

00:59:12.170 --> 00:59:15.940
And similarly, where we
previously had just d xj,

00:59:15.940 --> 00:59:19.430
now we have the derivative
of xj with respect to lambda,

00:59:19.430 --> 00:59:20.800
again, times d lambda.

00:59:20.800 --> 00:59:22.800
So we have two
powers of d lambda

00:59:22.800 --> 00:59:25.380
appearing in this expression.

00:59:25.380 --> 00:59:29.274
ds itself will be the
square root of ds squared.

00:59:29.274 --> 00:59:30.690
In this case, we
are talking about

00:59:30.690 --> 00:59:32.150
positive, definite distances.

00:59:32.150 --> 00:59:34.819
So we can take the square root.

00:59:34.819 --> 00:59:36.360
So we put a square
root sign over it.

00:59:36.360 --> 00:59:40.410
And now, we have only
one power of d lambda.

00:59:40.410 --> 00:59:43.900
And this describes the
length of the segment that

00:59:43.900 --> 00:59:48.650
goes from lambda to lambda plus
d lambda, the length as defined

00:59:48.650 --> 00:59:51.530
by the metric.

00:59:51.530 --> 00:59:53.520
The full length of the
line is obtained just

00:59:53.520 --> 00:59:58.210
by integrating that from 0
to the final value of lambda.

00:59:58.210 --> 01:00:03.660
So equation 540
here is what we're

01:00:03.660 --> 01:00:07.930
looking for-- the expression for
the length of the line in terms

01:00:07.930 --> 01:00:11.584
of the parametrization
that we've chosen.

01:00:11.584 --> 01:00:15.334
OK, any questions
about that formula?

01:00:15.334 --> 01:00:18.464
OK, next step-- and here's where
things get kind of complicated

01:00:18.464 --> 01:00:19.880
with the algebra,
although I think

01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:21.710
the ideas are still
pretty simple.

01:00:21.710 --> 01:00:23.840
The next step is
to figure out how

01:00:23.840 --> 01:00:27.280
we determine when
that expression is

01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:29.030
at its minimum value.

01:00:29.030 --> 01:00:32.220
How do we determine when the
path has the right properties

01:00:32.220 --> 01:00:35.450
that we found the
minimum length?

01:00:35.450 --> 01:00:48.015
So to do that, we want to
imagine varying the path.

01:00:51.740 --> 01:00:54.750
We want to consider comparing
the length of the path

01:00:54.750 --> 01:00:57.140
that we're thinking about to
the length of an arbitrary

01:00:57.140 --> 01:00:59.140
nearby path.

01:00:59.140 --> 01:01:03.570
And to do that, we can introduce
a little bit of extra notation

01:01:03.570 --> 01:01:04.290
here.

01:01:04.290 --> 01:01:07.490
Here's the point xA
Here's the point xB.

01:01:07.490 --> 01:01:11.840
x of lambda is the path
that we're thinking about.

01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:14.240
And we're asking the
question, is this the path

01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:16.220
of minimum possible length?

01:01:16.220 --> 01:01:18.150
And to do that, we're
going to compare it

01:01:18.150 --> 01:01:21.930
with an arbitrary nearby path.

01:01:21.930 --> 01:01:23.850
So the arbitrary
nearby path is what's

01:01:23.850 --> 01:01:27.240
called x tilde in this diagram.

01:01:27.240 --> 01:01:30.630
It starts at the same point xA
and ends at the same point xB.

01:01:30.630 --> 01:01:34.200
But along the way, it deviates
by an infinitesimal amount

01:01:34.200 --> 01:01:36.220
from the original path.

01:01:36.220 --> 01:01:41.630
And we're going to parametrize
that by equation 541a here.

01:01:41.630 --> 01:01:45.000
The tilde path will be
equal to the original path

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:49.150
plus a parameter that I'm going
to introduce called alpha times

01:01:49.150 --> 01:01:52.180
a function wi of lambda,
where wi of lambda

01:01:52.180 --> 01:01:54.300
is really an arbitrary function.

01:01:54.300 --> 01:01:56.680
And I've introduced this
extra parameter alpha

01:01:56.680 --> 01:01:58.480
just so I could say
in a simple way what

01:01:58.480 --> 01:02:01.140
it means for these paths to
be infinitesimally close,

01:02:01.140 --> 01:02:03.670
which just means that if alpha
has an infinitesimal value,

01:02:03.670 --> 01:02:05.940
the two paths are
infinitesimally close.

01:02:05.940 --> 01:02:07.920
And the function wi,
we'll think of being

01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:13.140
a perfectly finite function
with values like 2 and 5,

01:02:13.140 --> 01:02:17.540
not values that are
infinitesimally small.

01:02:17.540 --> 01:02:24.200
OK, with this
parametrization of our paths,

01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:26.695
we want to impose one
important criteria, which

01:02:26.695 --> 01:02:28.820
is that the two paths are
supposed to start and end

01:02:28.820 --> 01:02:34.360
at the same points, A and B.
And that means that this w super

01:02:34.360 --> 01:02:37.420
i that describes the
derivation between two paths

01:02:37.420 --> 01:02:39.400
have an advantage at
those two end points.

01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:42.010
Or else, the paths aren't going
from the same starting point

01:02:42.010 --> 01:02:43.300
to the same ending point.

01:02:43.300 --> 01:02:45.008
And, certainly if you
move the endpoints,

01:02:45.008 --> 01:02:46.510
you can always find
a shorter path.

01:02:46.510 --> 01:02:49.350
There's no geodesic if you allow
yourself to move the endpoints.

01:02:49.350 --> 01:02:52.000
So we insist therefore
that wi of 0,

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:55.690
which is wi at the
first endpoint, is 0.

01:02:55.690 --> 01:02:58.310
And similarly, wi of lambda
sub f at the other endpoint

01:02:58.310 --> 01:02:59.820
is also 0.

01:02:59.820 --> 01:03:02.330
That's what we insist on.

01:03:02.330 --> 01:03:05.270
OK, now having set
up this formalism,

01:03:05.270 --> 01:03:07.190
we can now write down
a very simple equation

01:03:07.190 --> 01:03:11.670
that says this path
is an extremum.

01:03:11.670 --> 01:03:13.770
The path is an
extremum if ds d alpha

01:03:13.770 --> 01:03:18.650
is equal to 0 for all
choices of wi of lambda.

01:03:18.650 --> 01:03:21.540
OK, if it's an extremum, it
means any small variation,

01:03:21.540 --> 01:03:24.180
any small variations are
proportional to alpha.

01:03:24.180 --> 01:03:28.080
Any small variation
produces 0 derivative.

01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:31.590
So ds d alpha should equal 0.

01:03:31.590 --> 01:03:34.020
And that should be the case
for any possible deviation

01:03:34.020 --> 01:03:38.480
if we really have found the
minimum possible length.

01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:39.211
OK?

01:03:39.211 --> 01:03:39.960
OK with everybody?

01:03:42.540 --> 01:03:47.370
OK, now, it's mostly just a
lot of gore to get the answer.

01:03:47.370 --> 01:03:50.370
The key step will be a
crucial integration by parts

01:03:50.370 --> 01:03:52.080
that you'll see in a minute.

01:03:52.080 --> 01:03:54.420
But let's just go through
the algebra together.

01:03:54.420 --> 01:03:59.160
I'm going to define an auxiliary
quantity a of lambda alpha,

01:03:59.160 --> 01:04:01.952
which is just the metric
times the derivatives

01:04:01.952 --> 01:04:02.660
of the functions.

01:04:05.930 --> 01:04:09.350
The path length of the
deviated path-- these

01:04:09.350 --> 01:04:11.010
are tilde functions here.

01:04:11.010 --> 01:04:14.550
So a is the integrand
for the length

01:04:14.550 --> 01:04:18.270
of the perturbed
path, the tilde path.

01:04:18.270 --> 01:04:21.190
So s of x tilde is
just the integral

01:04:21.190 --> 01:04:22.900
of the square root
of a, d lambda.

01:04:32.320 --> 01:04:34.880
OK, now we need some pieces
to carry out our derivative.

01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:38.820
So I've introduced a few
auxiliary calculations here

01:04:38.820 --> 01:04:41.230
that we can then put
into the big calculation.

01:04:41.230 --> 01:04:43.230
We're going to need the
derivative of the metric

01:04:43.230 --> 01:04:45.810
with respect to alpha.

01:04:45.810 --> 01:04:48.590
Now, the metric does not
depend directly on alpha.

01:04:48.590 --> 01:04:51.230
But the metric does
depend on x tilde.

01:04:51.230 --> 01:04:53.150
It's evaluated at
the point x tilde

01:04:53.150 --> 01:04:55.640
for any given value of lambda.

01:04:55.640 --> 01:04:58.860
And x tilde depends on alpha,
because remember, x tilde

01:04:58.860 --> 01:05:01.260
was equal to the original
path plus alpha times

01:05:01.260 --> 01:05:04.730
this wi, the derivation.

01:05:04.730 --> 01:05:07.060
So it's a chain rule
problem to figure out

01:05:07.060 --> 01:05:11.200
what the derivative of gij
is with respect to alpha.

01:05:11.200 --> 01:05:21.680
So it's the derivative
of gij with respect

01:05:21.680 --> 01:05:24.750
to xk times the
derivative of xk tilde

01:05:24.750 --> 01:05:29.250
with respect to alpha-- just
straightforward chain rule.

01:05:29.250 --> 01:05:31.720
And the derivative of x
tilde with respect to alpha

01:05:31.720 --> 01:05:36.810
is just this function, w super
i, or in this case, w super k.

01:05:36.810 --> 01:05:39.700
That's what defines
the deviations.

01:05:39.700 --> 01:05:41.790
So this is our result,
then, for the derivative

01:05:41.790 --> 01:05:44.980
of gij with respect to alpha.

01:05:44.980 --> 01:05:49.690
Then, we apply that to
differentiating s itself,

01:05:49.690 --> 01:05:52.250
finding all the alpha's
inside that square root.

01:05:52.250 --> 01:06:01.590
And scroll up a little bit so
we can see the definition of a.

01:06:01.590 --> 01:06:05.050
a consists of gij times
the dx's themselves.

01:06:05.050 --> 01:06:07.050
And the dx's themselves
depend on the alphas.

01:06:07.050 --> 01:06:09.670
So we're going to get terms
coming from differentiating

01:06:09.670 --> 01:06:11.260
those with respect to alpha.

01:06:11.260 --> 01:06:13.500
And we get a term coming
from differentiating

01:06:13.500 --> 01:06:16.580
the gij with respect to alpha.

01:06:16.580 --> 01:06:18.860
So the whole quantity
in the integrand

01:06:18.860 --> 01:06:22.580
here has a square
root operating on it.

01:06:22.580 --> 01:06:24.670
So the derivative of the
square root of a quantity

01:06:24.670 --> 01:06:27.330
is 1 over the square
root of the same quantity

01:06:27.330 --> 01:06:29.760
times the derivative
of the quantity,

01:06:29.760 --> 01:06:32.800
just differentiating
the 1/2 power of a.

01:06:32.800 --> 01:06:36.010
So that gives us a 1/2 and
1 over the square root of a.

01:06:36.010 --> 01:06:38.010
And then inside here,
we have the derivative

01:06:38.010 --> 01:06:40.910
of a with respect to alpha.

01:06:40.910 --> 01:06:44.000
And one of those terms,
we've already calculated.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:49.140
It's this multiplied
by dx i d lambda dx j

01:06:49.140 --> 01:06:51.950
d lambda, which come
along for the ride.

01:06:51.950 --> 01:06:53.880
And they lose their
tilde because we're

01:06:53.880 --> 01:06:57.070
trying to calculate the
derivative at alpha equals 0.

01:06:57.070 --> 01:06:59.960
So once we differentiate one
factor with respect to alpha,

01:06:59.960 --> 01:07:03.737
we evaluate the other
factors at alpha equals 0.

01:07:03.737 --> 01:07:04.820
So that's what we've done.

01:07:04.820 --> 01:07:09.780
We've evaluated the other
factors at alpha equals 0.

01:07:09.780 --> 01:07:14.250
And then, when we
differentiate dx i tilde

01:07:14.250 --> 01:07:18.140
with respect to d lambda, we
just get DWI d wi with respect

01:07:18.140 --> 01:07:19.140
to lambda.

01:07:19.140 --> 01:07:24.050
And dx j d lambda comes
along, now evaluated at alpha

01:07:24.050 --> 01:07:25.200
equals 0.

01:07:25.200 --> 01:07:26.920
And similarly,
the second term is

01:07:26.920 --> 01:07:30.090
where we differentiated the
second factor here with respect

01:07:30.090 --> 01:07:30.819
to alpha.

01:07:30.819 --> 01:07:32.610
And we differentiate
with respect to alpha,

01:07:32.610 --> 01:07:34.571
we bring down the w.

01:07:34.571 --> 01:07:40.750
So this becomes dx i d
lambda dx j d lambda.

01:07:40.750 --> 01:07:42.349
So this is the expression.

01:07:42.349 --> 01:07:44.140
And now we want to
simplify it a little bit

01:07:44.140 --> 01:07:46.810
and figure out how to write
down an equation which

01:07:46.810 --> 01:07:48.320
tells us when it's actually 0.

01:07:53.004 --> 01:07:54.920
So first, we want to
simplify it a little bit.

01:07:54.920 --> 01:07:58.920
And I guess I want
to-- do they fit?

01:07:58.920 --> 01:08:00.300
Almost.

01:08:00.300 --> 01:08:05.960
What I want to argue is
that these last two terms

01:08:05.960 --> 01:08:08.670
are really equal to each
other up to just rearranging

01:08:08.670 --> 01:08:10.040
the indices.

01:08:10.040 --> 01:08:12.670
Remember, i and j are
just being summed over.

01:08:12.670 --> 01:08:15.410
So we could have called them
any letter we wanted, and they

01:08:15.410 --> 01:08:17.670
would still just
be summed 1 and 2.

01:08:17.670 --> 01:08:19.240
And in particular,
we can interchange

01:08:19.240 --> 01:08:21.390
what we call i with
what we call j.

01:08:21.390 --> 01:08:23.432
And then, these two terms
would become identical.

01:08:23.432 --> 01:08:25.556
And we're allowed to do
that because these are just

01:08:25.556 --> 01:08:26.830
what are called dummy indices.

01:08:26.830 --> 01:08:29.350
They're just names of indices
that are being summed over.

01:08:29.350 --> 01:08:30.766
And you get the
same sum no matter

01:08:30.766 --> 01:08:33.649
what you call the index
you're summing over.

01:08:33.649 --> 01:08:38.710
So those terms can be combined,
giving us just 2 times

01:08:38.710 --> 01:08:41.120
either one of those
two terms we can keep.

01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:43.060
And now, we only two
terms in our expression,

01:08:43.060 --> 01:08:45.140
which is not bad.

01:08:45.140 --> 01:08:49.204
But things are still
a little complicated.

01:08:49.204 --> 01:08:51.370
And what makes them complicated
at this point, which

01:08:51.370 --> 01:08:54.460
is what we have to get
rid of, is the fact

01:08:54.460 --> 01:09:00.600
that w occurs as a multiplicity
factor in the first term.

01:09:00.600 --> 01:09:02.390
But w is differentiated
with respect

01:09:02.390 --> 01:09:04.350
to lambda in the second term.

01:09:04.350 --> 01:09:07.840
And when it's written
that way, there's

01:09:07.840 --> 01:09:11.930
no direct way you could see
what properties w has to have

01:09:11.930 --> 01:09:14.310
or the other terms
have to have so

01:09:14.310 --> 01:09:17.340
that the expression vanishes.

01:09:17.340 --> 01:09:21.470
But the crucial
trick for handling

01:09:21.470 --> 01:09:23.824
that particular issue-- and
it's the only real issue

01:09:23.824 --> 01:09:24.490
in this problem.

01:09:24.490 --> 01:09:27.620
The rest is just straightforward
or sometimes tedious

01:09:27.620 --> 01:09:29.310
manipulations.

01:09:29.310 --> 01:09:32.380
The key step is to
integrate by parts

01:09:32.380 --> 01:09:35.050
to turn the derivative
of w expression

01:09:35.050 --> 01:09:38.020
into an expression that is
just multiplicative in w.

01:09:38.020 --> 01:09:41.859
And the miraculous thing is
that for the situation we have,

01:09:41.859 --> 01:09:44.951
there are no boundary terms
that arise from that integration

01:09:44.951 --> 01:09:45.450
by parts.

01:09:49.410 --> 01:09:53.029
So here's integration by parts
spelled out in gory detail.

01:09:53.029 --> 01:09:55.170
We're going to use the
famous formula that

01:09:55.170 --> 01:09:57.620
says that the integral
of udv is equal to minus

01:09:57.620 --> 01:10:01.930
the interval at vdu plus
the product U times V

01:10:01.930 --> 01:10:05.360
evaluated at the two
endpoints and subtracted.

01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:06.860
So this is just the
standard formula

01:10:06.860 --> 01:10:09.700
that defines
integration by parts.

01:10:09.700 --> 01:10:15.990
The U is the term that starts
out not having derivatives

01:10:15.990 --> 01:10:17.390
and later acquires derivatives.

01:10:17.390 --> 01:10:21.460
So that's the 1 over
root a gij dxj d lambda

01:10:21.460 --> 01:10:24.710
of this-- this is the quantity
we're trying to calculate.

01:10:24.710 --> 01:10:32.560
And the du will just be--
I'm sorry-- dv will just

01:10:32.560 --> 01:10:34.263
be the factor which
is a differential

01:10:34.263 --> 01:10:37.950
in the original expression,
d wi d lambda times d lambda

01:10:37.950 --> 01:10:41.190
we're going to let
be equal to dv.

01:10:41.190 --> 01:10:44.400
So this u and this dv give
us the original integral.

01:10:44.400 --> 01:10:46.875
This integral is the
same as the integral

01:10:46.875 --> 01:10:49.600
we're trying to evaluate.

01:10:49.600 --> 01:10:53.920
Now when we integrate by parts,
we apply a derivative to U

01:10:53.920 --> 01:10:57.470
to write down dU, which means
it's just the derivative

01:10:57.470 --> 01:11:00.660
with respect to lambda of the
quantity in brackets times

01:11:00.660 --> 01:11:02.660
d lambda.

01:11:02.660 --> 01:11:04.040
That's the du.

01:11:04.040 --> 01:11:08.650
And dv is just
easily integrable.

01:11:08.650 --> 01:11:09.845
D is equal to wi.

01:11:12.646 --> 01:11:15.020
Now, the important thing is
to look at the boundary term.

01:11:15.020 --> 01:11:16.770
Because if the boundary
term went on 0,

01:11:16.770 --> 01:11:19.420
we might not have
accomplished anything.

01:11:19.420 --> 01:11:22.510
But the boundary term is 0
because the boundary term

01:11:22.510 --> 01:11:27.270
is the product of U
times V, and V is wi.

01:11:27.270 --> 01:11:30.930
And wi vanishes at both
boundaries that remember,

01:11:30.930 --> 01:11:35.235
was just the condition that
the path goes between A and B.

01:11:35.235 --> 01:11:37.360
When you vary the path,
you don't vary the points A

01:11:37.360 --> 01:11:40.280
and B. You only vary
the path in between.

01:11:40.280 --> 01:11:41.802
So wi vanishes at the endpoint.

01:11:41.802 --> 01:11:43.760
So that means that v
vanishes at the endpoints.

01:11:43.760 --> 01:11:45.990
So that means if the
product of U times V

01:11:45.990 --> 01:11:47.800
vanishes at the end points.

01:11:47.800 --> 01:11:50.310
And that means our boundary
term, our service term,

01:11:50.310 --> 01:11:52.910
does not contribute.

01:11:52.910 --> 01:11:56.290
So we turned the original
integral into another integral

01:11:56.290 --> 01:11:59.200
where now wi appears as
the multiplicity factor

01:11:59.200 --> 01:12:01.640
and it's no longer
differentiated.

01:12:01.640 --> 01:12:04.410
Lots of other things get
differentiated in the process.

01:12:04.410 --> 01:12:06.590
But wi gets to sit by itself.

01:12:06.590 --> 01:12:09.090
And that now makes it easy
to combine these two terms

01:12:09.090 --> 01:12:12.295
and see under what
circumstances the sum vanishes.

01:12:16.290 --> 01:12:19.100
So the integral, after
we make this integration

01:12:19.100 --> 01:12:22.420
by parts on one
of the two terms,

01:12:22.420 --> 01:12:27.120
becomes this expression
where now, the w's

01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:29.130
are always multiplicative.

01:12:29.130 --> 01:12:31.890
And by rearranging the names
of these dummy indices--

01:12:31.890 --> 01:12:35.950
as we initially have it, w has a
superscript k in the first term

01:12:35.950 --> 01:12:38.370
and the subscript i
and the second term.

01:12:38.370 --> 01:12:40.870
But one could rearrange
these dummy indices--

01:12:40.870 --> 01:12:44.360
we could name them anything you
want-- so that in both cases,

01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:47.750
w has the same index.

01:12:47.750 --> 01:12:49.450
And then you can factor it out.

01:12:49.450 --> 01:12:51.170
And then you get this
marvelous equation,

01:12:51.170 --> 01:12:53.650
which is now very close
to being an equation

01:12:53.650 --> 01:12:55.460
that we're prepared
to deal with.

01:13:07.742 --> 01:13:09.200
The question we
want to address now

01:13:09.200 --> 01:13:13.999
is under what circumstances
does this vanish for every wi?

01:13:13.999 --> 01:13:15.540
Now, if we only know
that it vanished

01:13:15.540 --> 01:13:18.300
for some particular
wi, then we would not

01:13:18.300 --> 01:13:19.520
be able to say very much.

01:13:19.520 --> 01:13:21.360
Because it's very
easy for an integral

01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:25.960
to be nonzero all over the
place, literally everywhere

01:13:25.960 --> 01:13:28.730
except maybe at some
isolated points and still

01:13:28.730 --> 01:13:29.770
integrate to 0.

01:13:29.770 --> 01:13:31.270
It could be positive
in some places,

01:13:31.270 --> 01:13:36.050
negative in other places and
zero only at crossing points

01:13:36.050 --> 01:13:38.530
and still integrate to 0.

01:13:38.530 --> 01:13:43.620
But if this is going
to vanish for any wi,

01:13:43.620 --> 01:13:46.150
then the claim is that the
quantity in curly brackets

01:13:46.150 --> 01:13:49.460
has to vanish identically.

01:13:49.460 --> 01:13:51.490
And I think the
best way to prove

01:13:51.490 --> 01:13:54.550
that is to say that if
the quantity in brackets

01:13:54.550 --> 01:13:57.450
did not vanish
identically, then you

01:13:57.450 --> 01:14:01.270
could let wi be equal to
the quantity in brackets.

01:14:01.270 --> 01:14:05.409
Remember, if this is
non-zero for any wi,

01:14:05.409 --> 01:14:06.950
we have a contradiction
because we're

01:14:06.950 --> 01:14:11.230
going to require this
to vanish for any wi.

01:14:11.230 --> 01:14:13.770
So if the quantity in
brackets were nonzero,

01:14:13.770 --> 01:14:15.599
we could let wi be
the same quantity.

01:14:15.599 --> 01:14:18.140
And then we would just have the
integral of a perfect square.

01:14:18.140 --> 01:14:21.290
And then clearly, the
integral would not vanish.

01:14:21.290 --> 01:14:23.417
So that shows that if
the quantity in brackets

01:14:23.417 --> 01:14:25.000
does not vanish, the
integral does not

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.809
vanish, at least for some wi.

01:14:27.809 --> 01:14:29.350
And that means that
if the integral's

01:14:29.350 --> 01:14:30.808
going to vanish
for every wi, which

01:14:30.808 --> 01:14:34.090
is what we're trying to impose,
the quantity in curly brackets

01:14:34.090 --> 01:14:35.860
has to vanish identically.

01:14:35.860 --> 01:14:37.950
And that's our conclusion.

01:14:37.950 --> 01:14:42.280
So that implies--
and I guess here

01:14:42.280 --> 01:14:43.780
is where we're going to stop.

01:14:43.780 --> 01:14:46.046
But we get to the
famous boxed equation.

01:14:46.046 --> 01:14:48.170
And this really is-- we'll
simplify it a little bit

01:14:48.170 --> 01:14:49.820
afterwards next time.

01:14:49.820 --> 01:14:51.960
But this really is the result.

01:14:51.960 --> 01:14:54.464
The geodesic equation
is that equation,

01:14:54.464 --> 01:14:56.630
which is just the equation
that the quantity that we

01:14:56.630 --> 01:14:59.890
had in curly brackets vanishes.

01:14:59.890 --> 01:15:03.130
So if the path that
we've chosen has

01:15:03.130 --> 01:15:05.490
the property that
these derivatives are

01:15:05.490 --> 01:15:08.280
equal to each other-- and
notice it depends on the metric

01:15:08.280 --> 01:15:09.850
and it depends on the path.

01:15:09.850 --> 01:15:12.790
Because you have dx d
lambda appearing everywhere.

01:15:12.790 --> 01:15:16.230
And x of lambda is the path.

01:15:16.230 --> 01:15:19.820
But if this equation
holds, then that path

01:15:19.820 --> 01:15:21.250
is a stationary point.

01:15:21.250 --> 01:15:23.520
It's an if and only
if statement as long

01:15:23.520 --> 01:15:25.610
as paths are continuous.

01:15:25.610 --> 01:15:27.025
That is the geodesic equation.

01:15:27.025 --> 01:15:30.242
It tells us whether or not
our path is the minimum.

01:15:30.242 --> 01:15:31.950
And next time, we will
simplify it a bit.

01:15:31.950 --> 01:15:34.190
And we'll look at
examples and understand

01:15:34.190 --> 01:15:36.290
how the formula works.

01:15:36.290 --> 01:15:39.810
So I'll see you folks
again next Tuesday.

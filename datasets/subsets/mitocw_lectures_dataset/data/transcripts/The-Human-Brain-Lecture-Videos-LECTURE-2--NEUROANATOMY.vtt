WEBVTT

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.337
NANCY KANWISHER: So seeing
where animals are going,

00:00:14.337 --> 00:00:16.379
so you can avoid them if
they're coming after you

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.020
or so you can catch them if
you're going after them, right?

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.160
One of the arguably
uniquely human abilities

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.560
is precision throwing, right?

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:26.940
No other animal can do that.

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:28.740
That's a very human thing.

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.140
Although, visual motion is
shared with lots of ability

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.060
to see motion is shared
with lots of animals.

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:34.770
What else did you notice?

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.200
What else seemed funny or harder
to discern with stop motion?

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.070
Yeah?

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.370
AUDIENCE: We care about small
details like [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.533
to understand what
the person is seeing.

00:00:47.533 --> 00:00:48.450
NANCY KANWISHER: Yeah.

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.097
Yeah, so I was
making notes to self.

00:00:52.097 --> 00:00:53.430
I haven't done that demo before.

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.347
But in future, it would
be really good to have

00:00:55.347 --> 00:00:57.300
the audio quality terrible.

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.130
Because if the audio
quality is terrible,

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:00.868
you would lean more
on lip reading.

00:01:00.868 --> 00:01:02.160
And we might have noticed more.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.739
But it's really hard to
do that probably even

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.550
at relatively fast flicker rates
because that motion information

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:09.270
is important.

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.200
Absolutely.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.860
What else?

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:18.700
How about beyond
just lip reading?

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.685
What else did you notice about
the faces, mine or Jim's?

00:01:24.712 --> 00:01:25.420
Could you-- yeah?

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:26.545
AUDIENCE: They were static.

00:01:26.545 --> 00:01:28.600
So it was kind of hard
to tell like emotion

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.870
because a lot of the
ways we express emotion

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:32.568
is very nuanced.

00:01:32.568 --> 00:01:33.610
NANCY KANWISHER: Exactly.

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:34.480
Exactly.

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:36.730
Facial expressions
are incredibly subtle.

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:39.250
Like little
microexpressions flicker

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.950
across the face in a tenth
of a second and go away,

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:43.360
and you guys detect them.

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.230
Like we're very, very
sensitive to those things.

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:52.642
Sometimes if you see somebody
in a hallway and, for a moment,

00:01:52.642 --> 00:01:54.850
there's an expression that
flickers across their face

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:56.530
and then they give
you a normal smile,

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.090
but you can tell
from that expression

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:59.840
that actually they
didn't want to see you,

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.150
for whatever reason, right?

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:02.290
We catch those things.

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:03.832
We're really, really
good at catching

00:02:03.832 --> 00:02:05.560
those little
fleeting expressions.

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.900
And those probably have to
do with not just sampling

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:09.940
with fine temporal frequency
but probably seeing

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.670
the direction of motion of
each little part of the face.

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:13.480
OK?

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.940
OK, so this is just
common sense reasoning

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.980
about what we might
have motion for.

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:18.610
OK?

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.090
And so you guys got all the
things that I had in mind.

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.840
OK, so now the next question,
just kind of thought question,

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.860
speculation question, given
these many different things

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.100
that make motion important
to us, biologically,

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.310
ecologically, in
our daily lives,

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.170
maybe that's important
enough that we

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.850
might allocate special brain
machinery to processing motion.

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:44.860
What do you think?

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:45.850
Important enough?

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:48.550
Could you get by if you lived
in a strobe world all the time?

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:49.930
Could you survive just fine?

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:54.577
Hard to say, right?

00:02:54.577 --> 00:02:55.160
Might be hard.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.070
I mean, we probably don't need
to go hunting down predators.

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:00.058
But you walk across
Vassar Street.

00:03:00.058 --> 00:03:01.850
And there's some pretty
dangerous predators

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:04.100
coming down Vassar Street
in the way of cars, right?

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:05.690
You need to know
where they're going

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:07.482
and whether you can
cross in front of them.

00:03:07.482 --> 00:03:10.285
So it's actually pretty
hard to live life

00:03:10.285 --> 00:03:11.660
without being able
to see motion.

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:14.540
And I'll tell you about a woman
who has that experience later

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.040
in the lecture.

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.817
OK, next question,
just think about this.

00:03:19.817 --> 00:03:21.650
I'm not going to test
you on it or anything.

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.150
It's not the topic
of this course.

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.130
But it's a perspective
you should take.

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.460
Imagine that this
were a CS course

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:30.770
and I gave you a
segment of video.

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:33.950
And your task was to
write some code that

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:36.770
takes that video input
and says whether objects

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:40.430
are moving in that movie or
says which objects are moving

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:43.010
or how much they're moving or
what direction they're moving.

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:45.290
What kind of code
would you have to write

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.740
to take that video input
to try to figure that out?

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:50.148
OK, so just think about that.

00:03:50.148 --> 00:03:52.190
We're not going to be
writing code in this class.

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:53.898
But a lot of what
we're going to be doing

00:03:53.898 --> 00:03:56.330
is thinking about,
how do you take

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:58.610
this kind of perceptual
input and come out

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:00.350
with that kind of
perceptual inference?

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:02.780
And what kinds of
computations would

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.380
have to go on in between whether
those computations are going on

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:09.260
in code that you guys write
or in a piece of brain that's

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:10.700
doing that computation?

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.430
And thinking about how
you might write the code

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:15.080
gives you really
important insights

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:17.209
about what the brain
might be doing.

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:18.200
OK?

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.610
All right, so that's the
point of all of that.

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:22.600
The Marr reading talks
about all of this.

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.350
And the key point we're
trying to get here

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:27.260
is that you can't
understand perception

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.290
without thinking about what
each perceptual inference is

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:33.020
necessary for ecologically
in daily lives

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:36.020
and about the computational
challenges involved

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:37.490
in making that inference.

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:38.240
OK?

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:42.950
So we'll get back to all
that next week and beyond.

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:45.135
But meanwhile, here's
the agenda for today.

00:04:45.135 --> 00:04:46.010
So here's the agenda.

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:47.090
We just did the demo.

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:50.420
We're now going to skip and do
some neuroanatomy, absolutely

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:51.200
bare basics.

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:54.650
Because on Wednesday, we
have this amazing opportunity

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:58.730
to have one of the most famous
neuroscientists in the world

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:00.950
do a dissection of
a real human brain

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:02.390
right here right
in front of you.

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:03.920
It's going to be awesome.

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:07.640
And I don't want to
waste that opportunity

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:10.520
or embarrass ourselves
by having people not

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:11.468
know the bare basics.

00:05:11.468 --> 00:05:13.010
So we're going to
do the bare basics.

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:15.537
It's all stuff you should
know from 900 and 901.

00:05:15.537 --> 00:05:17.120
And I'm going to
whip through it fast,

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:18.745
so we can get to more
interesting stuff

00:05:18.745 --> 00:05:20.180
and get back to visual motion.

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:21.140
OK?

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:22.910
That's the agenda.

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:25.340
All right, so some
absolute bare basics

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:28.910
of the brain, the human brain
contains about 100 billion,

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:30.530
10 to the 11th neurons.

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:32.250
And that's a very big number.

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:34.850
That's such a big number it's
approximately Jeff Bezos'

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:35.700
worth.

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:38.100
Well, it was until Mackenzie
got into the picture.

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:39.088
So we'll see.

00:05:39.088 --> 00:05:40.880
No, you don't need to
remember this number.

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:43.190
Just know it's a
really big number.

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:45.150
Basics of a neuron,
here's a neuron.

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:47.460
A neuron is a cell like
any other cell in the body.

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:49.520
It's got a cell body
and a nucleus, just

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:50.922
like any other
cell in your body.

00:05:50.922 --> 00:05:52.880
But the thing that's
distinctive about a neuron

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:55.483
is it has a big long
process called an axon.

00:05:55.483 --> 00:05:57.650
It's got a bunch of dendrites,
the little processes,

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:00.110
the little thingies
near the cell body.

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:04.190
And out at the tip of the axon,
that's your classic neuron.

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:06.740
Many neurons have
a myelin sheath,

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:11.150
a layer of rolled up fat
around the axon made up

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:12.110
of other cells.

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:14.952
That makes the axon conduct
neural signals faster.

00:06:14.952 --> 00:06:16.160
OK, you should know all that.

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:17.955
I'm not trying to insult
your intelligence.

00:06:17.955 --> 00:06:20.330
I'm just trying to make sure
everybody's with the program

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:20.870
here.

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:24.710
OK, so you have thousands
of synapses on each neuron.

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:28.280
And that means you have-- to
put it technically-- a shitload

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:29.990
of synapses in your brain.

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:31.040
OK?

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:35.210
Another important point, the
brain runs on a mere 20 watts.

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:38.570
And if you're not impressed
with that, reflect on the fact

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:41.930
that IBM's Watson
runs on 20,000 watts.

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:44.240
So one of the cool things
about the human brain

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:45.800
is not just all
the awesome stuff

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.080
that we can do that
still no computer can do,

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:50.090
that I talked about
last time, but also

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:52.730
how incredibly
energetically efficiently

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:55.550
we do it with our human brains.

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:58.400
So most of this course is
going to talk about the cortex.

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:00.450
That's all the stuff on
the outside of the brain.

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:01.825
That's that sheet
wrapping around

00:07:01.825 --> 00:07:06.200
the outside of the brain,
that folded outer surface.

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:12.290
It's approximately the size
and area of a large pizza.

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:14.780
But there are lots of
other important bits too.

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:16.430
And I'm going to just
do whirlwind tour

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:18.625
of those other bits now.

00:07:18.625 --> 00:07:20.000
OK, so you can
think of the brain

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.988
as composed of four major
kinds of components.

00:07:22.988 --> 00:07:24.530
Deep down in the
bottom of the brain,

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:27.447
you have the brain stem, where
the spinal cord comes in here.

00:07:27.447 --> 00:07:29.030
And the rest of the
brain is up there.

00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:30.780
And the brain stem
is right down here.

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:33.500
And the cerebellum, this
little cauliflower like thing

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:36.470
that sits out right back there.

00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:39.080
And in the middle
of the brain, you

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:40.790
have the limbic system
with a whole bunch

00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:41.810
of subcortical regions.

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:44.940
And we'll talk about a
few of those in a moment.

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:48.710
And you have white matter,
all the cables and connections

00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:51.020
that go from one part of
the brain to another part.

00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:53.610
This is an actual
dissected human brain.

00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:55.830
And all those kind of
weird fibrous things

00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:59.640
are bundles of axons connecting
remote parts of the brain

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:00.460
to each other.

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:03.040
You can see them in
gross dissection.

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:04.710
OK?

00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:06.310
And of course, you
have the cortex.

00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:09.125
OK, so these are just four
major things to think about.

00:08:09.125 --> 00:08:11.250
And before we spend the
rest of the course on that,

00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:13.050
we're going to do just
a teeny little bit

00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:15.300
on the other major bits.

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:16.570
OK, and I'm going fast.

00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:19.050
So just stop me if any
of this isn't clear.

00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:21.960
All right, so the reason
we're doing this in part

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:24.390
is that, with a
dissection of a brain,

00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:26.520
some of the main
things you see are

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:28.320
those subcortical
structures, right?

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:31.620
And so even though the course
is going to focus on the cortex,

00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:34.110
each little different bit of
the cortex to the naked eye

00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:35.940
looks like any other
bit of the cortex.

00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:38.940
It's the subcortical stuff
that looks different, right?

00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:40.830
So that's why we're doing this.

00:08:40.830 --> 00:08:43.500
OK, bare basics
on the brain stem,

00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:45.480
you can think of it
as a bunch of relays

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:49.410
in here, different centers that
connect information coming up

00:08:49.410 --> 00:08:53.590
from the spinal cord and send
it through into the cerebellum.

00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:57.060
So it's, in many ways, the most
primitive part of the brain.

00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:59.340
That means it's
shared with animals

00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:00.930
that branched off
from us very far

00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:03.540
back in mammalian evolution.

00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:05.740
But it's also essential to life.

00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:06.240
OK?

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:09.582
So you can get by with
most of your cortex gone.

00:09:09.582 --> 00:09:11.040
Like you may not
have a lot of fun.

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:12.707
You may not really
know what's going on.

00:09:12.707 --> 00:09:14.100
But you will stay alive.

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:16.890
But you can't get by without
your brain stem, right?

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:20.850
It controls all kinds of basic
crucial bodily functions,

00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:24.390
like breathing, consciousness,
temperature regulation,

00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:24.930
et cetera.

00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:27.660
So it's not interesting
cognitively.

00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:30.420
But it's crucial for life.

00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:33.810
Cerebellum, this
beautiful thing here,

00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:37.380
it's basically involved
in motor coordination.

00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:39.450
But from there on out,
there's a huge debate

00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:41.380
about its possible
role in cognition.

00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:43.440
And so there's lots of
brain-imaging studies

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:46.140
where people find that
the cerebellum is engaged

00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:48.210
in all kinds of
things from aspects

00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:51.120
of perception up through aspects
of language understanding.

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:55.290
You can find activations
in brain-imaging studies.

00:09:55.290 --> 00:09:57.930
Nonetheless, the best
guess is that you actually

00:09:57.930 --> 00:10:01.510
don't need a cerebellum
for any of this.

00:10:01.510 --> 00:10:03.133
So if anybody's
interested, I'm going

00:10:03.133 --> 00:10:04.800
to actually try to
remember to put it up

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:06.258
as an optional
reading on the site.

00:10:06.258 --> 00:10:08.550
There's a recent
article in The Atlantic

00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:11.910
or The New Yorker about a
kid who had no cerebellum.

00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:15.330
And he learned to
walk late and slow.

00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:16.707
Nobody knew what
his problem was.

00:10:16.707 --> 00:10:18.540
But he learned to do
pretty much everything.

00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:20.070
Like he's pretty much fine.

00:10:20.070 --> 00:10:22.480
His motor coordination
isn't great, but he's fine.

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:23.100
Yeah?

00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:25.100
AUDIENCE: How would you
define the consciousness

00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:25.890
in this context?

00:10:25.890 --> 00:10:27.060
NANCY KANWISHER: Oh,
that's a good question.

00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:28.343
And it's a big question.

00:10:28.343 --> 00:10:30.510
And it's a question that
nobody knows how to answer,

00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:31.540
not just me.

00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:34.410
So Christof Koch,
who does more work

00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:35.910
on the neural basis
of consciousness

00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:37.590
than just about
anybody, has been

00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:40.090
going around saying,
for about 15 years,

00:10:40.090 --> 00:10:42.485
we must not get stuck on
a premature definition

00:10:42.485 --> 00:10:43.860
of consciousness
because we don't

00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:46.193
know what that thing is that
we're trying to understand.

00:10:46.193 --> 00:10:50.360
So I'll hide behind Christof's
parry of that question

00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:52.360
and say we'll talk about
it later in the course.

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:54.960
But there are many
different ways

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:57.840
of defining it from the
difference between being awake

00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:00.240
versus asleep, which is
some of the functions that

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:04.500
go on here, the difference
between being knocked out

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:06.678
and completely unconscious
under general anesthesia,

00:11:06.678 --> 00:11:08.220
which is different
from being asleep.

00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:10.020
Those kind of states
of consciousness

00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:13.980
are regulated, in
part, in here, yeah.

00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:16.380
OK, so you can get by
without a cerebellum.

00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:19.260
But it's not recommended.

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:23.310
Moving right along, all
those subcortical bits, we're

00:11:23.310 --> 00:11:25.830
just going to talk about three
of the most important ones,

00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:28.350
the thalamus, this
big guy right smack

00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:31.290
in the middle of the brain,
very large structure,

00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:33.690
the hippocampus,
and the amygdala.

00:11:33.690 --> 00:11:35.670
OK, let's talk
about the thalamus.

00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:37.680
Think about the thalamus
as a Grand Central

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:41.040
Station of the brain, OK,
with all of these connections

00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:42.960
going to all those
parts of cortex

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:45.910
coming in and out of
the thalamus like that.

00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:46.980
OK?

00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:50.460
So one of the key things
about the thalamus

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:53.640
is that most of the
incoming sensory information

00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:57.570
goes by way of the thalamus
en route to the cortex.

00:11:57.570 --> 00:11:58.110
OK?

00:11:58.110 --> 00:12:00.780
So if you start with
your ear, there's

00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:02.700
sensory endings in
your ear that we'll

00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:04.290
talk about later in the term.

00:12:04.290 --> 00:12:07.380
And they send neurons into
this, the thalamus here,

00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:09.935
this yellow thing, through
a bunch of different stages.

00:12:09.935 --> 00:12:11.310
They make a stop
in the thalamus.

00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:13.440
And then they come up
here to this green patch,

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:15.480
which is auditory cortex.

00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:16.620
OK?

00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:20.520
Similarly,
somatosensory endings,

00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:22.560
touch sensors in
your skin that enable

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:25.380
you to feel when
you're being touched

00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:27.750
come in through the skin.

00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:30.150
And they make a stop
in the thalamus.

00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:34.140
And then they go up to
somatosensory cortex up there.

00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:35.580
OK?

00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:40.290
Similarly, visual signals
that come in from your eyes

00:12:40.290 --> 00:12:45.510
make a stop in the thalamus and
then go up to visual cortex.

00:12:45.510 --> 00:12:48.270
OK, what's the name of the
structure in the thalamus

00:12:48.270 --> 00:12:50.478
that those axons
make a synapse in?

00:12:50.478 --> 00:12:52.520
Coming up from the eyes,
you make a synapse here.

00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:54.620
And you go up to visual cortex.

00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:55.470
AUDIENCE: LGN.

00:12:55.470 --> 00:12:56.720
NANCY KANWISHER: LGN, perfect.

00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:57.470
What does it stand for?

00:12:57.470 --> 00:12:58.740
AUDIENCE: Lateral
geniculate nucleus.

00:12:58.740 --> 00:12:59.220
NANCY KANWISHER: Perfect.

00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:00.450
OK, you should know that.

00:13:00.450 --> 00:13:03.930
This is review from 900, 901.

00:13:03.930 --> 00:13:06.580
OK, yes?

00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:07.080
Sorry.

00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:12.150
OK, which sensory modality does
not go through the thalamus

00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:14.370
en route to cortex
between the sensory nerve

00:13:14.370 --> 00:13:17.450
endings and the cortex?

00:13:17.450 --> 00:13:17.950
Sorry?

00:13:17.950 --> 00:13:18.730
AUDIENCE: Olfactory.

00:13:18.730 --> 00:13:19.570
NANCY KANWISHER: Yes.

00:13:19.570 --> 00:13:20.080
Yes.

00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:21.122
You guys are on the ball.

00:13:21.122 --> 00:13:23.830
Yes, olfactory system is
the one sensory modality

00:13:23.830 --> 00:13:26.090
that doesn't make a
stop in the cortex.

00:13:26.090 --> 00:13:27.340
You can sort of see that here.

00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:31.240
From the nose, it goes straight
up into olfactory cortex

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:33.280
right there.

00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:36.670
All right, so that's
the standard view

00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:38.890
of the thalamus is this
kind of like relay station

00:13:38.890 --> 00:13:41.680
where all the external sensory
information comes in there,

00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:43.810
makes a stop, and then
goes up to cortex.

00:13:43.810 --> 00:13:44.710
OK?

00:13:44.710 --> 00:13:46.400
That's my thalamus act.

00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:46.900
Boom.

00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:47.620
Like that, right?

00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:48.520
OK.

00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:51.790
But, increasingly,
there's evidence

00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:54.280
that the thalamus is much
more than a relay station.

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:56.380
And why would you bother
with a relay anyway?

00:13:56.380 --> 00:13:57.340
Kind of doesn't mean anything.

00:13:57.340 --> 00:13:58.360
Kind of means like
we don't know what's

00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:00.220
going on here because
you wouldn't just make

00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:02.970
a synapse for no reason, right?

00:14:02.970 --> 00:14:05.098
OK, and so the
first thing to note,

00:14:05.098 --> 00:14:06.640
is there are lots
of connections that

00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:08.420
go back down the other way?

00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:10.720
There are 10 times
as many connections

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:12.880
that go from primary
visual cortex

00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:15.610
right here in me, right
here in this guy in red,

00:14:15.610 --> 00:14:19.360
there are 10 times as many
that go backwards down

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:23.680
to the thalamus as go forwards.

00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:25.210
That's mind blowing, right?

00:14:25.210 --> 00:14:27.580
Information comes from the
eyes up into the brain.

00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:30.493
What the hell are those things
doing going backwards, OK?

00:14:30.493 --> 00:14:32.660
Well, they're doing all
kinds of interesting things.

00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:35.118
So that's the first indication
that the thalamus isn't just

00:14:35.118 --> 00:14:39.080
relaying stuff in a
stupid, passive way.

00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:40.630
And the second
whole line of work,

00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:42.160
which many people
are working on,

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:45.040
but I think some of the most
awesome work on this topic

00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:48.430
is done by our own Mike
Halassa in this department.

00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:50.290
And he does these
incredible studies

00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:53.200
that you can do in mice with
these spectacular methods

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:56.530
that we can't use in humans,
where he can really take apart

00:14:56.530 --> 00:14:59.020
the circuit and
magnificent detail.

00:14:59.020 --> 00:15:00.610
And he's showing
that the thalamus

00:15:00.610 --> 00:15:04.180
is involved in all kinds
of high-level cognitive

00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:05.920
computations in mice.

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:07.150
It's really stunning work.

00:15:07.150 --> 00:15:09.820
When the mice have to switch
from doing one task to another,

00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:14.170
the thalamus plays a key role in
gating the flow of information

00:15:14.170 --> 00:15:18.040
from one cortical
region to another, OK?

00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:20.650
All right, moving along,
the hippocampus, I you

00:15:20.650 --> 00:15:21.820
guys all learned about this.

00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:23.560
The number one gripe
in this department

00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:25.690
as we learn about
H.M. in every course.

00:15:25.690 --> 00:15:26.990
So that's going to happen here.

00:15:26.990 --> 00:15:28.720
But it's going to
last about 20 seconds.

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:29.770
So here goes.

00:15:29.770 --> 00:15:32.207
That's a normal slice
of the brain like this.

00:15:32.207 --> 00:15:33.790
Here's the hippocampus
on either side.

00:15:33.790 --> 00:15:37.660
It's like a whole curled up deal
right there and right there.

00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:41.080
And here is H.M.'s brain,
the famous H.M., who

00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:44.110
had surgery to remove his
hippocampus on both sides,

00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:47.950
and completely lost his episodic
memory for anything that

00:15:47.950 --> 00:15:49.730
happened after his surgery.

00:15:49.730 --> 00:15:50.230
OK?

00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:53.440
You all remember that, right?

00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:55.570
If anybody hasn't heard
of H.M., send me an email.

00:15:55.570 --> 00:15:57.580
And I'll give you some
background reading.

00:15:57.580 --> 00:16:00.870
OK, so very loosely,
the hippocampus

00:16:00.870 --> 00:16:03.910
involved both in this kind
of long-term episodic memory

00:16:03.910 --> 00:16:05.200
that H.M. lost.

00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:08.050
And it also plays a
key role in navigation,

00:16:08.050 --> 00:16:12.230
which we'll talk about in
great detail in a few weeks.

00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:14.200
And I just want to say
that some cases are

00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:16.960
even more extreme than H.M.

00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:19.490
So there's a case of
Lonni Sue Johnson.

00:16:19.490 --> 00:16:21.340
And I am trying to
get you guys a video.

00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:22.550
And I didn't get it in time.

00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:25.175
But I'll show it to you later in
the term if you're interested.

00:16:25.175 --> 00:16:28.000
Lonni Sue Johnson
had a viral infection

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.600
that went up into her brain.

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:32.080
She was an extremely
accomplished person.

00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:34.510
She did illustrations on
the cover of The New Yorker.

00:16:34.510 --> 00:16:35.440
She was a pilot.

00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:37.900
She had her own
farm in which she

00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:42.430
raised lots of stuff, a
very smart, interesting,

00:16:42.430 --> 00:16:46.360
multitalented woman, who
had this terrible tragedy

00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:49.240
of getting viral
encephalitis at I

00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:51.130
don't know what
age, but middle age.

00:16:51.130 --> 00:16:56.440
And she now does not remember
a single event in her life.

00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:57.550
She's smart.

00:16:57.550 --> 00:16:58.720
She's funny.

00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:01.330
Her personality
is totally intact.

00:17:01.330 --> 00:17:02.920
She can answer questions.

00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:03.580
She can paint.

00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:05.270
She can do all kinds of things.

00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:08.440
But she does not remember
a single event in her life.

00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:10.180
That's pretty astonishing.

00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:13.359
Reflect on what it means
to have the sense of self

00:17:13.359 --> 00:17:15.310
if you don't remember
anything in your life.

00:17:15.310 --> 00:17:15.810
Yeah?

00:17:15.810 --> 00:17:17.780
AUDIENCE: Can she
remember her name?

00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:18.710
NANCY KANWISHER:
That's a good question.

00:17:18.710 --> 00:17:19.420
I'm not sure she.

00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:20.980
Might know her-- yes,
she does know her name.

00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:22.720
Actually, it is
evident in this video.

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:25.270
But the video, well, so
she doesn't remember.

00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:27.069
At one point in this
video, she's asked,

00:17:27.069 --> 00:17:29.170
were you ever married?

00:17:29.170 --> 00:17:32.890
And she's lovely and sweet and
gentle and kind of low key.

00:17:32.890 --> 00:17:35.200
And she's like, you know,
just don't remember.

00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:36.040
I might have been.

00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:37.210
I might have been.

00:17:37.210 --> 00:17:39.590
She was married for 10 years.

00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:41.590
So that's the hippocampus.

00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:42.170
Important.

00:17:42.170 --> 00:17:43.503
You don't want to lose that one.

00:17:43.503 --> 00:17:44.590
Yeah?

00:17:44.590 --> 00:17:47.170
AUDIENCE: About H.M.,
if the hippocampus

00:17:47.170 --> 00:17:50.590
is used in long-term memory,
why is it that it being removed

00:17:50.590 --> 00:17:54.267
caused him to not form memories?

00:17:54.267 --> 00:17:56.350
NANCY KANWISHER: Well, so
long-term memory means--

00:17:56.350 --> 00:17:57.880
it's a vague term.

00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:00.550
It means the formation
and retrieval

00:18:00.550 --> 00:18:02.780
of memories that are
going to last a long time.

00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:05.320
So in H.M.'s case, he can
access a lot of the memories

00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:07.030
from before his injury.

00:18:07.030 --> 00:18:10.060
In Lonni Sue's case,
she can't do even that.

00:18:10.060 --> 00:18:11.860
OK?

00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:16.300
All right, the
amygdala, OK, amygdala

00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:18.520
is a Greek word
that means almond.

00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:22.330
Because the amygdala is the
size and shape of an almond.

00:18:22.330 --> 00:18:26.170
And so just for fun, we're
passing around some almonds,

00:18:26.170 --> 00:18:28.360
my favorite kind.

00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:30.070
Have some almonds
and pass them around.

00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:35.080
All right, OK, so
the amygdala is

00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:38.500
involved in experiencing
and recognizing emotions,

00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:40.000
especially fear.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.460
The simple statement that you
should remember about what

00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:46.090
the amygdala does is just
remember the four F's.

00:18:46.090 --> 00:18:49.870
You guys all know about the
four F's, fighting, fleeing,

00:18:49.870 --> 00:18:51.040
feeding, and mating.

00:18:53.890 --> 00:18:59.080
OK, patient SM lost her
amygdala on both sides.

00:18:59.080 --> 00:18:59.980
OK?

00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:02.590
She cannot experience fear.

00:19:02.590 --> 00:19:05.290
She doesn't recognize
fear on facial expressions

00:19:05.290 --> 00:19:06.500
of other people.

00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:09.340
And she doesn't
experience fear herself.

00:19:09.340 --> 00:19:10.150
OK?

00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:13.780
And so that's the
striking piece of evidence

00:19:13.780 --> 00:19:15.280
on what the amygdala does.

00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:18.790
Her face recognition is
normal, recognizing identities.

00:19:18.790 --> 00:19:20.540
Her IQ is normal.

00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:23.710
She's overly trusting
of other people.

00:19:23.710 --> 00:19:26.013
OK?

00:19:26.013 --> 00:19:27.430
OK, so that's all
you need to know

00:19:27.430 --> 00:19:29.950
about the amygdala for now.

00:19:29.950 --> 00:19:33.160
OK, let's talk about white
matter, just brief review.

00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:36.280
Here's a kind of tunnel
through a piece of cortex.

00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:38.650
OK, so my brain cortex is
wrapping around like that.

00:19:38.650 --> 00:19:41.560
If we took a piece like
this, just took a segment out

00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:43.840
like that, this is the
outside of the brain up there.

00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:45.610
Cortex runs like this.

00:19:45.610 --> 00:19:48.340
And gray matter is the
stuff on the outer surface

00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:51.430
that's full of cell bodies, OK?

00:19:51.430 --> 00:19:54.580
White matter are the
axons, the processes

00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:56.200
that come out of
those cell bodies

00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:58.610
and travel elsewhere
in the brain.

00:19:58.610 --> 00:19:59.110
OK?

00:19:59.110 --> 00:20:00.490
Everybody clear on that?

00:20:00.490 --> 00:20:02.860
OK, so we got gray matter up
here and white matter down

00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:06.370
there, mostly myelinated axons
that have that layer of fat

00:20:06.370 --> 00:20:09.010
to make them conduct fast.

00:20:09.010 --> 00:20:13.220
And so you'll see bundles of
white matter in the dissection.

00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:15.790
And so here's an
actual photograph

00:20:15.790 --> 00:20:17.050
of the slice through a brain.

00:20:17.050 --> 00:20:19.960
So all that white stuff
up there is white matter.

00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:22.240
OK, and so you might
say, well, that's

00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:24.190
just a big bunch of wires.

00:20:24.190 --> 00:20:25.880
Who cares about that?

00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:26.860
That's a good question.

00:20:26.860 --> 00:20:29.560
But actually, the wires
are pretty damn interesting

00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:31.540
and pretty fundamental.

00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:33.370
And so I'll just give
you a few reasons.

00:20:33.370 --> 00:20:34.960
And you don't need to
memorize every one of these.

00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:37.430
I'm trying to give you a gist
of why we might care about this.

00:20:37.430 --> 00:20:39.763
And then there will be a whole
other lecture on networks

00:20:39.763 --> 00:20:41.680
and connectivity
later in the course.

00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:45.640
Well, first of all, white matter
is 45% of the human brain, OK?

00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:48.160
So it takes up a lot of space,
all those wires connecting

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:50.440
one bit to another bit.

00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:53.620
And I would say we cannot
possibly understand the cortex

00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:56.860
and how it works or any little
piece of it without knowing

00:20:56.860 --> 00:20:59.530
the connectivity of each
piece to each other bit

00:20:59.530 --> 00:21:00.880
of the cortex, right?

00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:03.910
Imagine trying to understand
a computer or a circuit

00:21:03.910 --> 00:21:06.850
without being able to see the
connections between the bits.

00:21:06.850 --> 00:21:08.223
Like it would drive you crazy.

00:21:08.223 --> 00:21:10.390
That's the situation we're
in now in human cognitive

00:21:10.390 --> 00:21:10.960
neuroscience.

00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:12.550
It, frankly, drives me insane.

00:21:12.550 --> 00:21:13.660
But that's where we are.

00:21:16.570 --> 00:21:19.570
Next thing, the
long-range connectivity

00:21:19.570 --> 00:21:21.970
of each little bit of cortex,
some little bit right there

00:21:21.970 --> 00:21:24.790
in my brain, is
connected to some bunch

00:21:24.790 --> 00:21:26.950
of other remote
regions in my brain.

00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:29.230
And that particular
set of connections

00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:31.970
is distinctive for
that patch of cortex.

00:21:31.970 --> 00:21:34.780
So you can think of it as
a connectivity fingerprint

00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:36.382
of a patch of cortex.

00:21:36.382 --> 00:21:38.590
OK, so one of the ways that
the different bits differ

00:21:38.590 --> 00:21:40.930
from each other is by
way of their connectivity

00:21:40.930 --> 00:21:41.705
fingerprints.

00:21:41.705 --> 00:21:43.330
And I'm going to skip
the rest of these

00:21:43.330 --> 00:21:45.250
because we're going to
get back to them later.

00:21:45.250 --> 00:21:46.625
And I'm going to
run out of time.

00:21:46.625 --> 00:21:51.010
And I'm going to assign the
TAs to sound the gong at 12:15.

00:21:51.010 --> 00:21:51.730
OK?

00:21:51.730 --> 00:21:52.900
Good.

00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:55.220
All right, now we're
up to the cortex.

00:21:55.220 --> 00:21:58.000
This is really,
laughably, shallow.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.650
But whatever, that's
what we're doing here.

00:22:00.650 --> 00:22:01.570
So here's this cortex.

00:22:01.570 --> 00:22:03.362
And as I mentioned,
it's a whole big sheet.

00:22:03.362 --> 00:22:05.650
And the different bits look
really similar if you just

00:22:05.650 --> 00:22:07.300
look at them or slice them up.

00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:08.860
So how are we
going to figure out

00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:11.350
how this thing is organized?

00:22:11.350 --> 00:22:15.170
Well, OK, now we're up
here talking about cortex.

00:22:15.170 --> 00:22:17.410
All right, let's start
with the easy parts,

00:22:17.410 --> 00:22:19.240
which you've already seen.

00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:20.830
You've already
seen this up here.

00:22:20.830 --> 00:22:27.550
These colored bits, visual
cortex, auditory cortex,

00:22:27.550 --> 00:22:33.250
somatosensory cortex, gustatory
taste cortex, those bits

00:22:33.250 --> 00:22:35.380
are like the easy
parts of cortex.

00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:37.930
Those are called
primary sensory regions.

00:22:37.930 --> 00:22:40.790
There's also motor cortex right
in front of sensory cortex.

00:22:40.790 --> 00:22:43.630
So those are the
primary regions.

00:22:43.630 --> 00:22:45.340
They're primary in
the sense of this

00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:48.310
is the first place that
sensory information lands up

00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:51.820
at the cortex coming up
from the senses, right?

00:22:51.820 --> 00:22:57.670
OK, and all of that input is
wired through what structure?

00:23:00.248 --> 00:23:01.040
AUDIENCE: Thalamus.

00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:01.915
NANCY KANWISHER: Yes.

00:23:01.915 --> 00:23:03.380
Thank you.

00:23:03.380 --> 00:23:06.440
So how are these
regions organized?

00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:08.150
Well, they have maps.

00:23:08.150 --> 00:23:10.640
Every one of these
regions has a map.

00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:12.840
And each of them has a
map of a different thing.

00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:14.830
So let's start
with visual cortex,

00:23:14.830 --> 00:23:16.580
and we're going to
talk about the map that

00:23:16.580 --> 00:23:18.210
lives in visual cortex.

00:23:18.210 --> 00:23:20.780
But the prior condition
for understanding that map

00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:23.533
is to understand the concept
of receptive field, which

00:23:23.533 --> 00:23:24.200
you should know.

00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:27.020
So I'm going to whip
through it quickly.

00:23:27.020 --> 00:23:29.510
OK, so here is how
you map the receptive

00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:33.480
field as a property of an
individual cell in a brain.

00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:33.980
OK?

00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:36.950
So the classic way in
animal neuroscience

00:23:36.950 --> 00:23:39.680
is you place an
electrode in the brain

00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:42.810
next to a neuron in
monkey visual cortex.

00:23:42.810 --> 00:23:43.310
OK?

00:23:43.310 --> 00:23:44.180
So here's this monkey.

00:23:44.180 --> 00:23:45.847
He's got an electrode
right in his brain

00:23:45.847 --> 00:23:47.660
right next to a neuron
in visual cortex.

00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:51.260
And every time that neuron
fires, you get a spike.

00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:52.430
You hear a spike.

00:23:52.430 --> 00:23:56.990
OK, now you train the monkey
to stare at a fixation spot

00:23:56.990 --> 00:23:59.030
without moving its eyes.

00:23:59.030 --> 00:24:01.520
OK, I can do this with
humans without training you.

00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:04.290
I can just tell you, look
at the tip of my nose.

00:24:04.290 --> 00:24:06.667
OK, so keep your eyes
on the tip of my nose.

00:24:06.667 --> 00:24:08.250
I can see if you're
looking elsewhere.

00:24:08.250 --> 00:24:09.590
So look at the tip of my nose.

00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:10.280
OK?

00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:11.860
OK, so you train a
monkey to do that.

00:24:11.860 --> 00:24:12.860
That takes a few months.

00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:14.150
And then they can do that.

00:24:14.150 --> 00:24:16.970
And then while recording
from neurons in his brain,

00:24:16.970 --> 00:24:19.460
you put stimuli over here,
put a flash over there

00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:22.850
or a flash over here or a flash
over here or a flash over here.

00:24:22.850 --> 00:24:24.350
OK, you can stop
looking at my nose.

00:24:24.350 --> 00:24:26.630
It's not all that fabulous
a nose, I realize.

00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:32.840
OK, so a receptive field is
the place in the visual world

00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:35.460
that makes a given neuron fire.

00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:35.960
OK?

00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:37.550
So if there's a
neuron in your brain

00:24:37.550 --> 00:24:40.700
that responds to a flash here
but not a flash here or here

00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:44.150
or here or here, the
receptive field of that neuron

00:24:44.150 --> 00:24:45.410
is right there.

00:24:45.410 --> 00:24:47.180
Everybody got that idea?

00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:49.670
OK, so in visual
cortex, neurons have

00:24:49.670 --> 00:24:50.890
restricted receptive fields.

00:24:50.890 --> 00:24:53.390
They don't respond to anything
anywhere in the visual field.

00:24:53.390 --> 00:24:56.480
They respond to a
particular place in space.

00:24:56.480 --> 00:24:58.940
OK, if that's confusing
at all, ask a question.

00:24:58.940 --> 00:25:01.200
Because it will come
up again and again.

00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:03.200
All right, so that's what
the rest of this slide

00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:04.100
says, what I just said.

00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:04.620
Blah, blah, blah.

00:25:04.620 --> 00:25:05.060
It doesn't matter.

00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:06.170
That's a receptive field.

00:25:06.170 --> 00:25:09.740
Different visual neurons have
different receptive fields

00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:11.870
for different parts of space.

00:25:11.870 --> 00:25:13.940
Now here comes the
important idea.

00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:16.940
In visual cortex,
two neurons that

00:25:16.940 --> 00:25:19.580
are next to each
other in visual cortex

00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:22.490
have nearby receptive fields.

00:25:22.490 --> 00:25:23.990
OK?

00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:26.870
So that's the
concept of retinotopy

00:25:26.870 --> 00:25:29.100
or the map in visual cortex.

00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:31.670
So you basically have a
map of the visual world

00:25:31.670 --> 00:25:36.073
in your visual cortex because
there's this systematic layout

00:25:36.073 --> 00:25:37.490
just like you have
in your retina.

00:25:37.490 --> 00:25:39.602
In your retina, visual
information comes in.

00:25:39.602 --> 00:25:41.810
And because of optics,
different parts of your retina

00:25:41.810 --> 00:25:43.700
respond to different
parts of the image.

00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:47.300
But that information is
propagated back through the LGN

00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:49.670
up to primary visual
cortex where you still

00:25:49.670 --> 00:25:53.750
have a map of the visual space
up in primary visual cortex.

00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:55.130
OK?

00:25:55.130 --> 00:25:58.850
So that map is called
retinotopic in visual cortex

00:25:58.850 --> 00:26:02.550
because it's oriented
like the retina.

00:26:02.550 --> 00:26:05.210
And so here's a particularly
kind of gruesome but very

00:26:05.210 --> 00:26:08.900
literal depiction of this
property of retinotopy

00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:10.370
in a monkey brain.

00:26:10.370 --> 00:26:13.640
This is an experiment done
very long ago by Roger Tootell.

00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:19.880
And what he did was he used
a method called deoxyglucose.

00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:23.060
And so what deoxyglucose
is a molecule that's

00:26:23.060 --> 00:26:25.160
a whole lot like glucose.

00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:27.720
But it's got one little
change in the molecule,

00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:29.990
which means it gets stuck
on the metabolic chain.

00:26:29.990 --> 00:26:33.260
And so it gets taken up by cells
that want to take up glucose.

00:26:33.260 --> 00:26:36.020
And then it gets stuck in
there and can't be broken down.

00:26:36.020 --> 00:26:39.870
So it builds up in cells that
are metabolically active.

00:26:39.870 --> 00:26:40.370
OK?

00:26:40.370 --> 00:26:42.110
So you can put a
little radioactive

00:26:42.110 --> 00:26:47.330
tracer on deoxyglucose, inject
it into a person or an animal.

00:26:47.330 --> 00:26:51.140
And what happens is it builds
up with this radioactive tag

00:26:51.140 --> 00:26:53.210
on all the cells
that were active.

00:26:53.210 --> 00:26:54.600
Make sense?

00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:58.790
OK, so Tootell did an
experiment where he had

00:26:58.790 --> 00:27:00.590
the monkey fixate on a spot.

00:27:00.590 --> 00:27:02.550
And he presented
this stimulus here.

00:27:02.550 --> 00:27:04.160
So the monkey's
fixating right there.

00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:06.950
And this stimulus is
flashing on and off.

00:27:06.950 --> 00:27:10.400
He injects the radioactive
deoxyglucose into the monkey

00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:13.580
while the monkey's
looking at this.

00:27:13.580 --> 00:27:16.940
And then, I'm sorry to say, he
killed the monkey, rolled out

00:27:16.940 --> 00:27:19.040
visual cortex into a sheet.

00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:21.090
And there it is.

00:27:21.090 --> 00:27:23.600
And you can see the
bullseye pattern

00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:26.570
that the monkey was looking
at across the surface

00:27:26.570 --> 00:27:28.400
of visual cortex.

00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:30.740
Does everybody get that?

00:27:30.740 --> 00:27:32.810
OK, so that shows
you very literally

00:27:32.810 --> 00:27:35.240
what a retinotopic
map is in the brain.

00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:38.120
It's just like the map of the
visual world in the retina.

00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:40.220
But there it is up in
the back of the brain.

00:27:40.220 --> 00:27:42.320
And humans have this too.

00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:44.300
OK?

00:27:44.300 --> 00:27:47.090
And so this can be shown in
humans with functional MRI.

00:27:47.090 --> 00:27:49.970
We'll talk later more about
the methods of functional MRI.

00:27:49.970 --> 00:27:53.480
But here's a very
high-resolution functional MRI

00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:57.170
experiment done by some
people over MGH Charlestown.

00:27:57.170 --> 00:27:59.330
By the way, when I
have names on slides,

00:27:59.330 --> 00:28:02.660
it's just because, in science,
we don't get paid that much.

00:28:02.660 --> 00:28:05.600
And so our credit for our cool
data is kind of all we have.

00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:08.150
And so I can't stand to
talk about other people's

00:28:08.150 --> 00:28:10.005
cool experiments without
giving them credit.

00:28:10.005 --> 00:28:11.630
I do not expect you
to learn the names.

00:28:11.630 --> 00:28:13.417
It's just my little
personal tic that I

00:28:13.417 --> 00:28:15.500
need to have their name
there to give them credit,

00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:17.167
even though you don't
know who they are.

00:28:17.167 --> 00:28:18.080
OK.

00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:20.930
OK, so what this guy
John Polimeni did

00:28:20.930 --> 00:28:24.110
was show human subjects
this stimulus here.

00:28:24.110 --> 00:28:25.790
They were fixating right there.

00:28:25.790 --> 00:28:28.070
And the stimulus is
flickering with the dots kind

00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:29.330
of dancing around.

00:28:29.330 --> 00:28:31.910
And then he looked on
the back in visual cortex

00:28:31.910 --> 00:28:36.470
on the surface of the brain,
and he sees an M there.

00:28:36.470 --> 00:28:37.790
It's the same stimulus.

00:28:37.790 --> 00:28:39.560
It's just flipped
upside down, which

00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:40.728
is not deep or interesting.

00:28:40.728 --> 00:28:42.770
The cortex has to be
oriented one way or another.

00:28:42.770 --> 00:28:45.830
The brain doesn't care whether
you turn it around, right?

00:28:45.830 --> 00:28:47.690
And your map of visual
space is upside down

00:28:47.690 --> 00:28:49.220
in the back of the head.

00:28:49.220 --> 00:28:51.980
And you see that M. Does
everybody get how that also

00:28:51.980 --> 00:28:55.130
shows retinotopic
properties in the brain

00:28:55.130 --> 00:28:56.510
in human visual cortex?

00:28:56.510 --> 00:28:58.820
OK.

00:28:58.820 --> 00:29:01.670
All right, so the key
idea of retinotopy

00:29:01.670 --> 00:29:04.340
is that adjacent parts
of the visual field

00:29:04.340 --> 00:29:07.260
are mapped to adjacent
parts of the cortex.

00:29:07.260 --> 00:29:11.600
All right, OK, a little bit of
terminology just because people

00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:13.340
are fast and loose
with these things.

00:29:13.340 --> 00:29:17.030
I've already referred to V1
and primary visual cortex.

00:29:17.030 --> 00:29:18.950
It's also sometimes
called striate cortex.

00:29:18.950 --> 00:29:20.550
It's all the same thing.

00:29:20.550 --> 00:29:22.220
It's the part of
the visual cortex

00:29:22.220 --> 00:29:25.130
where the information first
comes up from the LGN right

00:29:25.130 --> 00:29:26.640
back here.

00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:28.230
So in me, it's right there.

00:29:28.230 --> 00:29:30.650
Most of it is in the space
between the two hemispheres.

00:29:30.650 --> 00:29:33.210
But a little bit
sticks out on the side.

00:29:33.210 --> 00:29:35.630
So in this person, that
yellowy orange stuff,

00:29:35.630 --> 00:29:37.400
that's primary
visual cortex, which

00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:39.690
is the same as V1
and striate cortex.

00:29:39.690 --> 00:29:40.190
OK?

00:29:40.190 --> 00:29:42.650
That's just terminology.

00:29:42.650 --> 00:29:45.260
All right, just as we have
maps for visual space,

00:29:45.260 --> 00:29:47.580
we have maps for touch space.

00:29:47.580 --> 00:29:49.790
And so you've probably
seen this diagram here

00:29:49.790 --> 00:29:53.570
of the map of touch space going
across somatosensory cortex

00:29:53.570 --> 00:29:54.390
like this.

00:29:54.390 --> 00:29:56.510
So this is a picture
of a slice like that,

00:29:56.510 --> 00:29:59.210
showing you which parts of the
body are mapped out to which

00:29:59.210 --> 00:30:00.680
parts of space.

00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:02.810
And you can see that
particularly important parts

00:30:02.810 --> 00:30:05.990
of the body get
bigger bits of cortex.

00:30:05.990 --> 00:30:06.890
Yeah?

00:30:06.890 --> 00:30:11.150
OK, just as we have visual
maps and touch maps,

00:30:11.150 --> 00:30:14.040
we have auditory maps
in auditory cortex,

00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:17.420
which is right on the top of
the temporal lobe right in here.

00:30:17.420 --> 00:30:20.120
And what's mapped out
in auditory cortex

00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:23.150
is auditory frequency,
high versus low

00:30:23.150 --> 00:30:26.100
versus high
frequencies of sound.

00:30:26.100 --> 00:30:29.120
And so you see that here's a
piece of auditory cortex in one

00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:31.640
subject, showing
you regions that

00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:34.640
respond to high frequencies, low
frequencies, high frequencies.

00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:36.830
Here it is another
subject, high, low, high,

00:30:36.830 --> 00:30:39.320
another subject,
high, low, high.

00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:44.030
OK, so the point of all of this
is that primary somatosensory

00:30:44.030 --> 00:30:45.350
cortex has maps.

00:30:45.350 --> 00:30:46.700
Everybody clear on this?

00:30:46.700 --> 00:30:50.510
The different sensory modalities
map different dimensions.

00:30:50.510 --> 00:30:53.870
OK, so what about
the rest of cortex?

00:30:53.870 --> 00:30:55.610
Like you can see,
most of the cortex

00:30:55.610 --> 00:30:58.970
is not primary sensory cortex.

00:30:58.970 --> 00:31:00.980
Is the rest of cortex just mush?

00:31:00.980 --> 00:31:04.130
Or are there separate bits
like primary sensory areas?

00:31:06.980 --> 00:31:10.340
And if so, do those
other bits have maps?

00:31:10.340 --> 00:31:14.450
And if so, what
are those maps of?

00:31:14.450 --> 00:31:15.140
OK?

00:31:15.140 --> 00:31:17.060
We just took you
from 100 years ago

00:31:17.060 --> 00:31:20.480
to the cutting edge of the field
is asking this question in lots

00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:22.340
of different ways right now.

00:31:22.340 --> 00:31:24.770
OK?

00:31:24.770 --> 00:31:28.160
OK, let's back up and ask,
what counts as a cortical area

00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:28.910
anyway?

00:31:28.910 --> 00:31:32.150
I just posited that these
primary sensory regions

00:31:32.150 --> 00:31:34.050
count as distinct things.

00:31:34.050 --> 00:31:35.810
They're like the things, right?

00:31:35.810 --> 00:31:37.450
They're separate
things in the brain.

00:31:37.450 --> 00:31:37.950
OK?

00:31:37.950 --> 00:31:40.370
And if for no other reason,
then they get direct input

00:31:40.370 --> 00:31:42.680
from the thalamus, right?

00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:46.970
OK, but let's back up
and ask, what exactly

00:31:46.970 --> 00:31:48.560
is a cortical area?

00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:51.800
And we're going to
consider this question

00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:54.860
by considering the three
key criteria for what

00:31:54.860 --> 00:31:57.110
counts as a cortical area.

00:31:57.110 --> 00:32:00.470
OK, the first one is that
that region of cortex

00:32:00.470 --> 00:32:04.040
is distinct from its
neighbors in function.

00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:06.230
Neurons there fire in
response to something

00:32:06.230 --> 00:32:08.587
different from the neurons
in the neighboring region.

00:32:08.587 --> 00:32:09.920
OK, that's very vague right now.

00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:12.950
But we'll illustrate that.

00:32:12.950 --> 00:32:13.730
The next one is--

00:32:13.730 --> 00:32:17.120
I mentioned this before--
each distinct region of cortex

00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:19.190
has a different
set of connections

00:32:19.190 --> 00:32:20.430
to other parts of the brain.

00:32:20.430 --> 00:32:23.300
It has a distinct
connectivity fingerprint.

00:32:23.300 --> 00:32:24.770
OK?

00:32:24.770 --> 00:32:28.760
And the third thing is,
for at least some regions

00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:30.980
of the cortex, they're
physically different.

00:32:30.980 --> 00:32:33.560
If you slice them up and stain
them and look at them really

00:32:33.560 --> 00:32:35.270
carefully, they
might look a little

00:32:35.270 --> 00:32:37.850
different than other
bits of the cortex.

00:32:37.850 --> 00:32:38.690
OK?

00:32:38.690 --> 00:32:40.760
So those are three of
the key criteria that

00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:44.120
have been used to say, this bit
of cortex, it's a thing, right?

00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:46.280
It's distinct, right?

00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:49.760
OK, so let's look at
the classic example

00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:51.440
beyond those primary regions.

00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:53.180
Those are the most
classic regions.

00:32:53.180 --> 00:32:54.950
Those are the primary regions
we've already talked about.

00:32:54.950 --> 00:32:57.000
Those are the ones nobody
would fight you on that.

00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:58.070
This one is next in line.

00:32:58.070 --> 00:33:00.490
Nobody would fight
you if you say,

00:33:00.490 --> 00:33:03.502
visual area MT, that's an area.

00:33:03.502 --> 00:33:04.210
Well, they might.

00:33:04.210 --> 00:33:05.410
But most people wouldn't.

00:33:05.410 --> 00:33:09.700
OK, and then from there on out,
it's all fighting all the time.

00:33:09.700 --> 00:33:12.430
OK, so let's talk
about visual area MT.

00:33:12.430 --> 00:33:14.960
It's a little patch of the
cortex in a monkey brain.

00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:17.080
This is a side view
of a monkey brain.

00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:21.220
And in this human brain, it's
that little patch right there.

00:33:21.220 --> 00:33:26.500
OK, so this region
meets all the criteria

00:33:26.500 --> 00:33:29.030
to be a distinct visual area.

00:33:29.030 --> 00:33:30.800
So how do we know this?

00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:33.440
Well, we know this from lots
and lots of different methods.

00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:35.732
So I'm going to whip through
a few of those to give you

00:33:35.732 --> 00:33:37.570
a gist of how we
can find evidence

00:33:37.570 --> 00:33:39.430
that that region is
distinct in functional

00:33:39.430 --> 00:33:43.960
connectivity and the physical
stuff, sometimes called

00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:45.850
cytoarchitecture.

00:33:45.850 --> 00:33:47.170
OK?

00:33:47.170 --> 00:33:49.270
All right, function,
how would we

00:33:49.270 --> 00:33:51.820
know that region has
a different function?

00:33:51.820 --> 00:33:54.280
Well, one way,
the classic way is

00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:57.880
to record from individual
neurons in monkey brains.

00:33:57.880 --> 00:34:01.600
So if you stick a neuron
into monkey visual cortex

00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:04.127
while the monkey is
looking at the stimulus

00:34:04.127 --> 00:34:05.710
that I'll show you
in a second, you'll

00:34:05.710 --> 00:34:07.930
hear the responses of
an individual neuron.

00:34:07.930 --> 00:34:10.780
Each click will be the response
of an individual neuron

00:34:10.780 --> 00:34:12.530
to the stimulus.

00:34:12.530 --> 00:34:17.790
So let's play this thing, except
it's not making any sound.

00:34:17.790 --> 00:34:18.929
Chris, can you help me?

00:34:22.469 --> 00:34:24.126
Oh, right.

00:34:24.126 --> 00:34:24.626
Duh.

00:34:45.690 --> 00:34:48.929
That part, OK, see when the
bar of light moves this way,

00:34:48.929 --> 00:34:53.643
it makes a lot of firing and
not when it moves the other way?

00:34:53.643 --> 00:34:54.810
Let's watch it for a second.

00:34:54.810 --> 00:34:55.980
Watch the bar move again.

00:35:12.235 --> 00:35:12.735
See?

00:35:12.735 --> 00:35:13.740
It responds less
when it's moving

00:35:13.740 --> 00:35:15.090
in a different direction.

00:35:15.090 --> 00:35:15.882
Everybody got that?

00:35:18.870 --> 00:35:23.400
What is this area
right there called?

00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:26.754
Yeah, this area right
here in the middle.

00:35:26.754 --> 00:35:27.630
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:27.630 --> 00:35:28.500
NANCY KANWISHER: Exactly.

00:35:28.500 --> 00:35:29.625
That's the receptive field.

00:35:29.625 --> 00:35:34.440
That's the part of visual space
that makes this neuron fire.

00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:37.590
OK, this neuron also has a
property called direction.

00:35:37.590 --> 00:35:39.540
It's sensitive to
motion, as you see.

00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:43.710
But it's also specific to
specific directions of motion.

00:35:43.710 --> 00:35:45.570
Everybody see that?

00:35:45.570 --> 00:35:50.280
OK, so that's a
direction-selective neuron

00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:52.590
in monkey area MT.

00:35:52.590 --> 00:35:55.560
And here's a way of showing,
with data, what you guys just

00:35:55.560 --> 00:35:56.370
saw.

00:35:56.370 --> 00:35:58.380
This is a map of
different directions

00:35:58.380 --> 00:35:59.860
in polar coordinates.

00:35:59.860 --> 00:36:02.160
And this shows you how much--

00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:04.960
this is a single cell
being described here.

00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:07.230
This is the direction
selectivity of that cell,

00:36:07.230 --> 00:36:09.810
showing you that when
the stimulus moves

00:36:09.810 --> 00:36:11.970
in this direction, you
get a lot of firing.

00:36:11.970 --> 00:36:14.550
When it moves in this
direction, you get less firing.

00:36:14.550 --> 00:36:17.250
And can everybody see how this
plot shows you the direction

00:36:17.250 --> 00:36:18.720
selectivity of that cell?

00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:20.010
Make sense?

00:36:20.010 --> 00:36:20.880
Right.

00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:23.910
OK, so that shows you what
you just saw in the movie.

00:36:23.910 --> 00:36:27.480
So this is one way to establish
the function of visual area

00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:30.300
MT is stick electrodes in
there and record directly

00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:33.810
from them when a monkey looks
at different kinds of stimuli.

00:36:33.810 --> 00:36:36.840
And you see direction
selectivity when you do that.

00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:41.970
OK, further, if you actually
do this systematically,

00:36:41.970 --> 00:36:47.520
moving across next door
bits of monkey area MT,

00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:49.890
what you find is that,
as we said before,

00:36:49.890 --> 00:36:54.390
nearby bits of cortex respond
to similar things, in this case,

00:36:54.390 --> 00:36:56.380
to similar directions of motion.

00:36:56.380 --> 00:36:57.660
So here's a little diagram.

00:36:57.660 --> 00:37:01.830
As you move across the cortex,
you see a systematic change

00:37:01.830 --> 00:37:03.780
in the direction
selectivity of neurons

00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:05.770
as you move across the cortex.

00:37:05.770 --> 00:37:10.380
So in MT, we have a map
of direction preference,

00:37:10.380 --> 00:37:13.530
just as we had a map
of spatial location

00:37:13.530 --> 00:37:15.060
in primary visual cortex.

00:37:15.060 --> 00:37:16.830
Make sense?

00:37:16.830 --> 00:37:20.260
OK, now because those neurons
are clustered like that--

00:37:20.260 --> 00:37:21.810
I forget what my next point was.

00:37:21.810 --> 00:37:22.050
No.

00:37:22.050 --> 00:37:22.380
Never mind.

00:37:22.380 --> 00:37:23.505
We'll get that in a second.

00:37:23.505 --> 00:37:24.780
OK, what about humans?

00:37:24.780 --> 00:37:26.140
OK, so here's a monkey brain.

00:37:26.140 --> 00:37:27.810
Here's a neuron
in a monkey brain.

00:37:27.810 --> 00:37:28.860
What about humans?

00:37:28.860 --> 00:37:30.915
Can we record from
single neurons in humans?

00:37:30.915 --> 00:37:31.770
What do you think?

00:37:34.857 --> 00:37:35.940
Do we ever get to do that?

00:37:38.820 --> 00:37:39.442
Yeah?

00:37:39.442 --> 00:37:40.770
AUDIENCE: Like neurosurgeons.

00:37:40.770 --> 00:37:41.710
NANCY KANWISHER: Yeah.

00:37:41.710 --> 00:37:42.800
Yeah.

00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:45.380
Neurosurgeons,
very occasionally,

00:37:45.380 --> 00:37:48.110
enable us to record
from individual neurons

00:37:48.110 --> 00:37:49.310
in human brains.

00:37:49.310 --> 00:37:51.710
It's the most awesome data ever.

00:37:51.710 --> 00:37:55.040
Of course, we only do it
when the neurosurgeons

00:37:55.040 --> 00:37:56.780
have decided, for
clinical reasons,

00:37:56.780 --> 00:37:58.340
to put electrodes
in human brains.

00:37:58.340 --> 00:38:02.360
They need to do this to map
out epilepsy before surgery.

00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:04.395
And sometimes those
patients are super nice

00:38:04.395 --> 00:38:06.020
and say, yes, I'll
look at your stimuli

00:38:06.020 --> 00:38:09.390
or listen to your stimuli while
you record from my neurons.

00:38:09.390 --> 00:38:11.390
And then we get the
most awesome data ever.

00:38:11.390 --> 00:38:12.728
But it's very, very rare.

00:38:12.728 --> 00:38:14.270
I don't know of any
data where people

00:38:14.270 --> 00:38:17.610
have reported individual
neurons in area MT in humans.

00:38:17.610 --> 00:38:18.110
Yeah?

00:38:18.110 --> 00:38:19.950
AUDIENCE: So how
powerful should an fMRI

00:38:19.950 --> 00:38:22.910
be to be able to record
such information?

00:38:22.910 --> 00:38:24.620
NANCY KANWISHER: Oh,
we're getting there.

00:38:24.620 --> 00:38:28.340
OK, so given that
we, very rarely,

00:38:28.340 --> 00:38:31.680
get to record from
individual neurons in humans

00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:34.310
and we want to more
generally if there is

00:38:34.310 --> 00:38:36.860
an MT in humans, what do we do?

00:38:36.860 --> 00:38:39.410
We pop subjects
in an MRI scanner.

00:38:39.410 --> 00:38:44.120
And we show them moving
dots or stationary dots.

00:38:44.120 --> 00:38:46.173
And we scan them
with functional MRI.

00:38:46.173 --> 00:38:47.840
We'll go through the
details of how this

00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:49.590
works more in future lectures.

00:38:49.590 --> 00:38:51.350
But what you see,
basically, is this

00:38:51.350 --> 00:38:53.450
is a slice through
the brain like this.

00:38:53.450 --> 00:38:58.100
And you see this region
right here responds more

00:38:58.100 --> 00:38:59.850
to the moving dots.

00:38:59.850 --> 00:39:00.750
This is the response.

00:39:00.750 --> 00:39:01.790
This is time here.

00:39:01.790 --> 00:39:03.980
This is when the moving
dots are on high response.

00:39:03.980 --> 00:39:06.560
And then when it switches
to stationary dots,

00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:08.510
the response drops.

00:39:08.510 --> 00:39:11.000
OK, so with functional
MRI, you can also

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:14.000
find the visual area empty
by the higher response

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:15.602
to moving than stationary dots.

00:39:15.602 --> 00:39:17.060
Does that make
sense, more or less?

00:39:17.060 --> 00:39:18.977
I mean, I'm not giving
you any of the details.

00:39:18.977 --> 00:39:20.600
But for now, they
don't really matter.

00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:23.420
OK, so that's cool.

00:39:23.420 --> 00:39:27.320
But does that tell us
that neurons in human MT

00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:29.330
are specific for the
direction of motion?

00:39:37.155 --> 00:39:37.655
Yes?

00:39:37.655 --> 00:39:40.580
AUDIENCE: Are the moving dots
moving to a specific location?

00:39:40.580 --> 00:39:42.788
NANCY KANWISHER: They're
moving in all the directions

00:39:42.788 --> 00:39:45.250
you see here.

00:39:45.250 --> 00:39:46.540
No, it doesn't.

00:39:46.540 --> 00:39:49.660
It tells us it's sensitive
to the presence of motion

00:39:49.660 --> 00:39:51.970
but not the direction of motion.

00:39:51.970 --> 00:39:53.260
OK?

00:39:53.260 --> 00:39:56.650
So if we want to really know,
is human MT like monkey MT

00:39:56.650 --> 00:39:59.560
or is this really human
MT, we want to know,

00:39:59.560 --> 00:40:02.380
are the neurons in there not
just responsive to motion

00:40:02.380 --> 00:40:04.840
but are neurons specific
for particular directions

00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:07.480
of motion, OK?

00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:10.360
So how would we do that?

00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:13.270
OK, well, there's lots
of ways of doing that.

00:40:13.270 --> 00:40:14.950
But actually, one of
the charming things

00:40:14.950 --> 00:40:17.327
is you can do that
without an MRI scanner.

00:40:17.327 --> 00:40:18.910
That is it won't
tell you whether it's

00:40:18.910 --> 00:40:19.785
MT you're looking at.

00:40:19.785 --> 00:40:22.210
But we can ask the question
of whether your brains have

00:40:22.210 --> 00:40:25.460
neurons that are tuned
for particular directions.

00:40:25.460 --> 00:40:30.370
So for this demo, I want you
to fixate right in the center.

00:40:30.370 --> 00:40:32.810
And do not move your
eyes from that dot.

00:40:32.810 --> 00:40:34.585
And I'm going to keep
talking for a while,

00:40:34.585 --> 00:40:37.420
while you keep fixating
right on that dot.

00:40:37.420 --> 00:40:39.520
And so what I'm
going to show you

00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:41.420
is something called
an after effect.

00:40:41.420 --> 00:40:45.070
This is also known as the
psychophysicist's electrode.

00:40:45.070 --> 00:40:48.310
Psychophysicists are people
who just measure behavior.

00:40:48.310 --> 00:40:50.740
And from behavior,
they can infer

00:40:50.740 --> 00:40:52.450
how individual neurons work.

00:40:52.450 --> 00:40:54.520
And that is about as
awesome as it gets.

00:40:54.520 --> 00:40:56.705
That's much more impressive
than just recording

00:40:56.705 --> 00:40:57.580
from the damn neuron.

00:40:57.580 --> 00:40:59.980
Inferring from
very indirect data

00:40:59.980 --> 00:41:02.880
how the neuron works from
behavior, now, that is pretty--

00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:03.380
oops.

00:41:03.380 --> 00:41:04.390
OK, sorry.

00:41:04.390 --> 00:41:07.420
Look directly at my face.

00:41:07.420 --> 00:41:08.410
You see anything?

00:41:08.410 --> 00:41:09.680
I didn't see it stop.

00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:11.770
OK, we're going
to-- oh, here we go.

00:41:11.770 --> 00:41:12.280
Oh, right.

00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:14.000
OK, just fixate on
the center again.

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:14.500
Sorry.

00:41:14.500 --> 00:41:17.020
I forgot this guy
was going to stop.

00:41:17.020 --> 00:41:19.930
So keep looking at the center.

00:41:19.930 --> 00:41:22.247
And then when it
stops in a little bit,

00:41:22.247 --> 00:41:23.830
then keep your eyes
right on that dot.

00:41:23.830 --> 00:41:25.038
And you can see what happens.

00:41:25.038 --> 00:41:26.163
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:41:26.163 --> 00:41:27.580
NANCY KANWISHER:
Oh, that's right.

00:41:27.580 --> 00:41:28.450
Good point.

00:41:28.450 --> 00:41:29.950
Yes, right now,
it's alternating.

00:41:29.950 --> 00:41:30.540
Nothing's going to happen.

00:41:30.540 --> 00:41:31.150
But that's OK.

00:41:31.150 --> 00:41:32.858
We're going to have
the whole experience.

00:41:32.858 --> 00:41:35.206
Keep fixating on the dot.

00:41:35.206 --> 00:41:38.000
It's good the TAs
are on the ball.

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:39.930
OK, fixate on the dot.

00:41:39.930 --> 00:41:42.040
Anybody see anything?

00:41:42.040 --> 00:41:43.240
Not really.

00:41:43.240 --> 00:41:43.740
That's OK.

00:41:43.740 --> 00:41:45.602
You're not supposed to.

00:41:45.602 --> 00:41:46.810
That's the control condition.

00:41:46.810 --> 00:41:48.700
It was alternating directions.

00:41:48.700 --> 00:41:49.550
OK?

00:41:49.550 --> 00:41:52.570
So I think it's going
to start moving again.

00:41:52.570 --> 00:41:53.260
I'm not sure.

00:41:53.260 --> 00:41:54.160
Let's go back.

00:41:54.160 --> 00:41:55.420
Let's just start it again.

00:41:55.420 --> 00:41:57.045
OK, I'm sorry I blew
it the first time.

00:41:57.045 --> 00:41:58.300
But let's just get this right.

00:41:58.300 --> 00:42:01.960
OK, fixate on the center
and just keep your eyes

00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:04.100
right on that center.

00:42:04.100 --> 00:42:07.090
So this one, it's
not alternating.

00:42:07.090 --> 00:42:10.300
And it's going to do this
for around 30 seconds.

00:42:10.300 --> 00:42:13.233
And so the whole point of
this is a way with behavior

00:42:13.233 --> 00:42:14.650
to ask the question
of whether you

00:42:14.650 --> 00:42:18.070
have neurons in your brain
tuned to specific directions

00:42:18.070 --> 00:42:19.510
of motion.

00:42:19.510 --> 00:42:22.300
And something as low-tech
and simple as an aftereffect

00:42:22.300 --> 00:42:23.290
can tell you that.

00:42:26.100 --> 00:42:26.655
Keep looking.

00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:31.400
Did you guys see anything?

00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:33.860
What did you see?

00:42:33.860 --> 00:42:35.060
What happened?

00:42:35.060 --> 00:42:39.170
AUDIENCE: It wasn't
moving exactly [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:39.170 --> 00:42:40.490
NANCY KANWISHER: Uh huh.

00:42:40.490 --> 00:42:41.750
Well, it actually should--

00:42:41.750 --> 00:42:43.250
well, now it's doing
something else.

00:42:43.250 --> 00:42:44.630
But it should shrink at the end.

00:42:44.630 --> 00:42:46.230
Did you guys see it shrink?

00:42:46.230 --> 00:42:47.690
OK, so that's an after effect.

00:42:47.690 --> 00:42:49.400
And the simple
version of the story

00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:51.530
is that you are tiring
out your neurons that

00:42:51.530 --> 00:42:53.510
are sensitive to outward
motion while you stare

00:42:53.510 --> 00:42:55.050
at all that outward motion.

00:42:55.050 --> 00:42:57.770
And after you kind of burn
them out and exhaust them,

00:42:57.770 --> 00:42:59.780
then when you look at
something stationary,

00:42:59.780 --> 00:43:02.300
it looks like it's going inward.

00:43:02.300 --> 00:43:03.410
OK?

00:43:03.410 --> 00:43:06.200
And the general idea is
you have pools of neuron--

00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:08.120
the easiest way to
account for that is you

00:43:08.120 --> 00:43:11.340
have pools of neurons tuned
for different directions.

00:43:11.340 --> 00:43:13.430
And that's why, if you
tire out one batch,

00:43:13.430 --> 00:43:15.720
you have a net signal
in the other direction.

00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:16.910
Does that make sense?

00:43:16.910 --> 00:43:19.130
This is all very relevant
to your assignment which

00:43:19.130 --> 00:43:21.410
is due tomorrow night at 6:00.

00:43:21.410 --> 00:43:24.400
This phenomenon was used in the
scanner for that experiment.

00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:28.670
You can think about how you
would use this phenomenon

00:43:28.670 --> 00:43:32.480
to ask whether there's direction
selectivity, not just responses

00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:34.670
to motion, in human MT.

00:43:34.670 --> 00:43:35.782
Yeah?

00:43:35.782 --> 00:43:37.490
AUDIENCE: I'm just a
little bit confused.

00:43:37.490 --> 00:43:40.970
So even when an image
is completely still,

00:43:40.970 --> 00:43:43.340
like even if you're
not detecting motion,

00:43:43.340 --> 00:43:45.110
those neurons are still firing?

00:43:47.073 --> 00:43:48.740
NANCY KANWISHER:
That's a good question.

00:43:48.740 --> 00:43:52.373
But most likely,
the simple cases--

00:43:52.373 --> 00:43:54.290
this may have not worked
beautifully, in part,

00:43:54.290 --> 00:43:57.410
because I screwed it up and
didn't notice when it stopped.

00:43:57.410 --> 00:44:00.290
But if it works well, you should
get a pretty powerful sense

00:44:00.290 --> 00:44:03.050
that after you see it
expanding, then when it's still,

00:44:03.050 --> 00:44:05.100
it should seem to
be contracting.

00:44:05.100 --> 00:44:06.980
So when that happens--

00:44:06.980 --> 00:44:10.400
the reading assigned for
today, tomorrow night

00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:12.050
tells you what
happens in your brain

00:44:12.050 --> 00:44:15.320
during that time when you are
looking at stationary stimuli

00:44:15.320 --> 00:44:17.678
but experiencing motion.

00:44:17.678 --> 00:44:19.220
So there's no motion
in the stimulus.

00:44:19.220 --> 00:44:21.300
But there's motion
in your percept.

00:44:21.300 --> 00:44:21.800
OK?

00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:23.430
So that's the question.

00:44:23.430 --> 00:44:23.930
All right?

00:44:23.930 --> 00:44:25.520
So read the paper and find out.

00:44:25.520 --> 00:44:27.490
Yeah?

00:44:27.490 --> 00:44:33.880
All right, so all of that tells
us just that there are neurons

00:44:33.880 --> 00:44:36.400
someplace in your brain that
are sensitive to the direction

00:44:36.400 --> 00:44:37.270
of motion.

00:44:37.270 --> 00:44:40.900
It doesn't tell us that
they're in MT in particular.

00:44:40.900 --> 00:44:43.330
But the assigned reading
will talk about that.

00:44:43.330 --> 00:44:45.040
OK?

00:44:45.040 --> 00:44:48.130
Right, a further
bit of evidence is

00:44:48.130 --> 00:44:51.520
remember I said how, in
monkeys, next door bits in MT

00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:54.820
have similar
direction selectivity.

00:44:54.820 --> 00:44:58.030
That means you can also
inject an electrical signal

00:44:58.030 --> 00:45:02.140
in a little patch of MT and
give the monkey a net percept

00:45:02.140 --> 00:45:04.540
of a direction of motion.

00:45:04.540 --> 00:45:05.980
OK?

00:45:05.980 --> 00:45:08.690
If all the neurons were
scrambled around spatially,

00:45:08.690 --> 00:45:11.860
so that there was no clustering
of neurons sensitive to, say,

00:45:11.860 --> 00:45:14.080
this direction of
motion, then stimulation

00:45:14.080 --> 00:45:15.298
wouldn't do anything.

00:45:15.298 --> 00:45:16.840
But if you train a
monkey to tell you

00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:18.693
what direction of
motion he's seeing

00:45:18.693 --> 00:45:20.860
and you show him just random
dots that aren't moving

00:45:20.860 --> 00:45:24.100
in any direction and you
stimulate one little patch,

00:45:24.100 --> 00:45:26.740
it'll tell you the
direction of motion

00:45:26.740 --> 00:45:29.590
of the neurons in
that little patch.

00:45:29.590 --> 00:45:32.620
And that is much more
powerful evidence

00:45:32.620 --> 00:45:37.180
that that region is not
only responsive to motion

00:45:37.180 --> 00:45:41.090
but causally involved in
your perception of motion.

00:45:41.090 --> 00:45:41.590
OK?

00:45:41.590 --> 00:45:45.400
I'm a little obsessed with this
distinction between recording

00:45:45.400 --> 00:45:47.480
responses and
establishing causality.

00:45:47.480 --> 00:45:49.820
So we'll go over this
in more detail later.

00:45:49.820 --> 00:45:52.850
But I want you to start
getting used to that idea.

00:45:52.850 --> 00:45:59.920
Another way to test the causal
role of area MT in motion

00:45:59.920 --> 00:46:04.060
is with patients with
brain damage in area MT.

00:46:04.060 --> 00:46:06.250
So there's one
famous patient who

00:46:06.250 --> 00:46:08.440
had brain damage
right there, which

00:46:08.440 --> 00:46:10.900
is right where MT usually is.

00:46:10.900 --> 00:46:12.970
And she could not see motion.

00:46:12.970 --> 00:46:14.590
And she reports
all kinds of things

00:46:14.590 --> 00:46:18.190
like difficulty crossing the
street, difficulty catching

00:46:18.190 --> 00:46:22.180
balls, difficulty
pouring water into a cup,

00:46:22.180 --> 00:46:25.180
OK, just as you
guys saw earlier.

00:46:25.180 --> 00:46:28.600
That's called
akinetopsia, right?

00:46:28.600 --> 00:46:29.950
Kinetics, motion.

00:46:29.950 --> 00:46:32.050
A, not motion, right?

00:46:32.050 --> 00:46:34.000
Opsia, eyes.

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:36.100
OK.

00:46:36.100 --> 00:46:38.980
All right, so I started
with these criteria

00:46:38.980 --> 00:46:43.240
for what makes something
a distinct area.

00:46:43.240 --> 00:46:45.525
And one piece of
evidence is function.

00:46:45.525 --> 00:46:46.900
And I just give
you a whole bunch

00:46:46.900 --> 00:46:49.390
of different kinds of
evidence for distinct function

00:46:49.390 --> 00:46:52.150
and visual area MT,
that it's specifically

00:46:52.150 --> 00:46:55.030
involved in motion processing.

00:46:55.030 --> 00:46:57.643
And the two other criteria,
which are getting short shrift,

00:46:57.643 --> 00:46:58.810
but I'll just toss them off.

00:46:58.810 --> 00:47:00.200
And we'll return to them.

00:47:00.200 --> 00:47:03.980
One is the distinct
connectivity of that region.

00:47:03.980 --> 00:47:07.120
OK, so you may have seen
this horrific wiring diagram

00:47:07.120 --> 00:47:08.860
of visual cortex in monkeys.

00:47:08.860 --> 00:47:11.830
I think it comes up in like
half the talks in classes

00:47:11.830 --> 00:47:13.450
in my field.

00:47:13.450 --> 00:47:15.500
This is the one down here.

00:47:15.500 --> 00:47:17.890
And so there's lots and lots
of different visual areas.

00:47:17.890 --> 00:47:20.290
And there's a whole
fancy wiring diagram.

00:47:20.290 --> 00:47:24.303
And smack in the middle of this
diagram, that's visual area MT.

00:47:24.303 --> 00:47:25.970
And if you blow this
up and stare at it,

00:47:25.970 --> 00:47:29.200
you'll see that MT has a
particular set of connections

00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:31.660
to other visual
regions in cortex.

00:47:31.660 --> 00:47:33.633
And its particular
set of connections

00:47:33.633 --> 00:47:35.050
are different from
the connections

00:47:35.050 --> 00:47:36.910
of any of those other regions.

00:47:36.910 --> 00:47:40.390
It's part of its connectivity
fingerprint or signature.

00:47:40.390 --> 00:47:43.540
And that's another piece of
evidence that it's a thing.

00:47:43.540 --> 00:47:44.050
OK?

00:47:44.050 --> 00:47:47.080
It's not just another like
amorphous bit of cortex.

00:47:47.080 --> 00:47:50.930
It's a particular
thing in the brain.

00:47:50.930 --> 00:47:53.140
And finally, you might
wonder, is that bit

00:47:53.140 --> 00:47:54.945
of cortex physically different?

00:47:54.945 --> 00:47:56.320
Are the cells in
there different?

00:47:56.320 --> 00:48:00.610
Are the layers of cortex
different in any way?

00:48:00.610 --> 00:48:04.450
And you may remember,
from probably 900,

00:48:04.450 --> 00:48:05.890
about Brodmann areas.

00:48:05.890 --> 00:48:08.020
Like this dude
Korbinian Brodmann

00:48:08.020 --> 00:48:10.870
sliced up lots of dead
brains, looked at them

00:48:10.870 --> 00:48:13.870
under a microscope,
and argued that there

00:48:13.870 --> 00:48:16.180
were 52 different
parts just from what

00:48:16.180 --> 00:48:18.740
it looked like if you slice
them up under a microscope.

00:48:18.740 --> 00:48:19.240
OK?

00:48:19.240 --> 00:48:21.220
So we called those
Brodmann areas.

00:48:21.220 --> 00:48:24.010
And area 17, this
primary visual cortex,

00:48:24.010 --> 00:48:27.040
comes from Brodmann's
terminology.

00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:29.560
And so he argued that there--

00:48:29.560 --> 00:48:32.170
he thought these were
distinct organs in the brain.

00:48:32.170 --> 00:48:35.620
And he even inferred the
specific histological

00:48:35.620 --> 00:48:37.450
differentiation of
the cortical areas

00:48:37.450 --> 00:48:40.120
proves irrefutably their
specific functional

00:48:40.120 --> 00:48:41.440
differentiation.

00:48:41.440 --> 00:48:42.220
Well, it doesn't.

00:48:42.220 --> 00:48:43.210
But never mind.

00:48:43.210 --> 00:48:44.950
Kind of sounded good.

00:48:44.950 --> 00:48:47.440
Anyway, that was his idea.

00:48:47.440 --> 00:48:50.080
And these kinds
of distinct, kind

00:48:50.080 --> 00:48:53.320
of cellular, physical,
anatomical differences

00:48:53.320 --> 00:48:57.370
are very salient for
primary cortical areas

00:48:57.370 --> 00:49:01.150
for vision and audition
and touch and motor cortex.

00:49:01.150 --> 00:49:04.700
But they're much muckier
for lots of other areas.

00:49:04.700 --> 00:49:07.360
One important exception,
which is why we chose this,

00:49:07.360 --> 00:49:09.070
is area MT.

00:49:09.070 --> 00:49:10.582
And so I'll end in one minute.

00:49:10.582 --> 00:49:12.290
But just to tell you
where this is going,

00:49:12.290 --> 00:49:14.800
this is a flattened piece
of monkey cortex rolled out

00:49:14.800 --> 00:49:16.160
like with a baking roller.

00:49:16.160 --> 00:49:16.660
No.

00:49:16.660 --> 00:49:17.290
I don't know.

00:49:17.290 --> 00:49:18.350
Something like that.

00:49:18.350 --> 00:49:19.750
So here's monkey cortex.

00:49:19.750 --> 00:49:20.877
And there's V1 and V2.

00:49:20.877 --> 00:49:21.710
And it's a big mess.

00:49:21.710 --> 00:49:24.670
But that big dark blob,
this bit of cortex

00:49:24.670 --> 00:49:28.260
is stained with something
called cytochrome oxidase.

00:49:28.260 --> 00:49:30.840
And that indicates
metabolic activity.

00:49:30.840 --> 00:49:35.130
MT neurons are very highly
metabolically active.

00:49:35.130 --> 00:49:38.110
And so here's a map
of visual cortex.

00:49:38.110 --> 00:49:40.590
And that exactly is area MT.

00:49:40.590 --> 00:49:44.430
So area MT actually
is histologically

00:49:44.430 --> 00:49:48.600
or cytoarchitectonically
different from its neighbors

00:49:48.600 --> 00:49:53.220
and fits all of the criteria
for a cortical area.

00:49:53.220 --> 00:49:53.760
OK?

00:49:53.760 --> 00:49:55.360
I went one minute over.

00:49:55.360 --> 00:49:57.360
I realize I threw out
a lot of terminology.

00:49:57.360 --> 00:49:58.950
I don't want you to
memorize too much.

00:49:58.950 --> 00:50:00.575
So I made a list of
the kinds of things

00:50:00.575 --> 00:50:02.940
that you should understand
from this lecture, the things

00:50:02.940 --> 00:50:05.330
that I think are important.

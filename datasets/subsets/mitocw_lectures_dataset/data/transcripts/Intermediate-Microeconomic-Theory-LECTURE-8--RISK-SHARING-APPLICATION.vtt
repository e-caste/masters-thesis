00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.750 align:middle line:84%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Welcome,
everybody, today,

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:16.810 align:middle line:84%
for the next segment
of the class.

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:20.840 align:middle line:84%
Actually, this is
literally a continuation.

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.740 align:middle line:84%
It's not a sharp break between
the last lecture and today.

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:26.230 align:middle line:84%
Fortunately, the
lecture today has

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.680 align:middle line:84%
some repeat of the equations,
or at least a version

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:31.330 align:middle line:90%
of those equations.

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:35.230 align:middle line:84%
Plus, I know you're all
totally fresh from the exam,

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.980 align:middle line:84%
so you know what the
last lecture was anyway.

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:40.480 align:middle line:90%
Just teasing you a little bit.

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:41.515 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:00:41.515 --> 00:00:45.040 align:middle line:84%
I'll just say a few
words about the calendar.

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:51.130 align:middle line:84%
So we are right here,
today, Thursday, 10/1.

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.880 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my goodness.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.620 align:middle line:90%
It is October.

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.730 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to do
risk-sharing applications today

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:59.860 align:middle line:90%
and then also 9.

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.440 align:middle line:84%
Although this says
risk-sharing applications,

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.020 align:middle line:84%
I want to feature that we'll
combine it with a production

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.770 align:middle line:84%
even in a more direct
way than we will today.

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.930 align:middle line:84%
So two lectures today, Thursday
and Tuesday, on risk-sharing.

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.600 align:middle line:90%
So that's the calendar.

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.960 align:middle line:84%
The second thing would
be the reading list.

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.060 align:middle line:90%
And we are here at lecture 8.

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.060 align:middle line:84%
So the two readings today
are risk and insurance

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.120 align:middle line:84%
in Village India, my
paper in Econometrica.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.760 align:middle line:84%
And we will cover that in
a fair amount of detail

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.760 align:middle line:84%
today, although not
every word, obviously.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.880 align:middle line:84%
And also, chapter 2 in
Medieval Village Economy.

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.710 align:middle line:90%
So that's the reading list.

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:47.080 align:middle line:84%
So today is lecture
8, and that is here.

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.620 align:middle line:84%
So risk-sharing
applications-- we're

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:51.900 align:middle line:84%
going to do two
different economies using

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.270 align:middle line:84%
the same theory, although
the questions to be

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.730 align:middle line:84%
asked, though related, are
a little bit different.

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:00.930 align:middle line:84%
One is Village India using
consumption and income

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.920 align:middle line:84%
data, which I refer to
as an ex-post version

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.500 align:middle line:84%
of the implications of
the risk-sharing model,

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.760 align:middle line:84%
and also, as anticipated,
the medieval village economy,

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.850 align:middle line:84%
where we're going to talk
about dividing up the land.

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.680 align:middle line:84%
And you've seen
maps of this before,

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.710 align:middle line:84%
but we didn't have
all of the tools we

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:21.750 align:middle line:90%
needed to really do a good job.

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.350 align:middle line:90%
But we do now.

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.850 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:28.280 align:middle line:84%
So for India, here's the
motivation from my paper.

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.220 align:middle line:84%
A large part of the population
in developing countries

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.800 align:middle line:90%
live in high-risk environments.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.890 align:middle line:84%
That said, there are numerous
ways to cope with it.

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.410 align:middle line:84%
One is to diversify the
activities you're undertaking--

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.860 align:middle line:84%
trying to have a
portfolio, as it were--

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.060 align:middle line:84%
or ex-post, after
incomes get realized,

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.290 align:middle line:84%
to engage in financial
transactions,

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.640 align:middle line:84%
including gifts and transfers
among family and family

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:57.840 align:middle line:90%
networks.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.560 align:middle line:84%
How well do any one of these
ex-post or ex-ante mechanisms

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:02.730 align:middle line:90%
work?

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.880 align:middle line:84%
Well, the main, quote,
"insight" of the paper

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.160 align:middle line:84%
was that we really
don't necessarily

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.200 align:middle line:90%
have to enumerate the mechanism.

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.560 align:middle line:90%
We just look at the outcome.

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.300 align:middle line:84%
I'll qualify that a
little bit, and we

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.250 align:middle line:90%
can keep coming back to this.

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.510 align:middle line:84%
If they diversified perfectly
and everyone had a balanced

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.450 align:middle line:84%
portfolio, then they would
all have the same outcome,

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.390 align:middle line:84%
and there would be no
further risk to share.

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.000 align:middle line:84%
So in some sense,
what we're going

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.320 align:middle line:84%
to go through today would not
have much content in the sense

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:37.220 align:middle line:84%
that today, we're
referring to risk sharing,

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:41.640 align:middle line:84%
but it's not done, per se, by
sharing risk after the fact.

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.540 align:middle line:84%
It's done by ex-ante
diversification.

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.400 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, those two
strands to repeat

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.570 align:middle line:84%
are going to be in
today's lecture.

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:51.510 align:middle line:84%
We're going to do the
ex-post part first,

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:55.070 align:middle line:84%
which assumes partial but
not complete diversification,

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:56.960 align:middle line:84%
and then look at
how they could do

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:01.100 align:middle line:84%
it ex-ante with partial but
potentially not complete

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:03.330 align:middle line:90%
diversification.

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:04.010 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:09.580 align:middle line:84%
So characteristics of village
economies as in India--

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:15.150 align:middle line:84%
very risky place, in large part
because agriculture does not

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.390 align:middle line:84%
provide a stable
source of income.

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:21.149 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
risk, idiosyncratic

00:04:21.149 --> 00:04:22.530 align:middle line:90%
and aggregate risk.

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:25.330 align:middle line:84%
Households diversify
in many ways.

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:29.430 align:middle line:84%
One-- not planting
all of the same crops.

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:32.190 align:middle line:84%
And we are going to use
this benchmark which

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:35.610 align:middle line:84%
assumes there's no information
problem, no moral hazard

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:39.630 align:middle line:84%
problem, no contract
enforcement problem.

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:42.500 align:middle line:84%
All of those words at
this point in the class

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.250 align:middle line:84%
don't make a whole lot
of sense because we

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:49.720 align:middle line:84%
haven't studied anything but
these frictionless economies.

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.150 align:middle line:90%
But that was the premise.

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.940 align:middle line:84%
And again, to anticipate
subsequent lectures,

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:56.130 align:middle line:84%
today we'll see how
well this theory does

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:59.100 align:middle line:90%
without any of these frictions.

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:01.500 align:middle line:84%
And then subsequent
literature has

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.860 align:middle line:84%
started to assume things
like contract enforcement

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:06.960 align:middle line:84%
and information
asymmetries, but we are not

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.470 align:middle line:90%
going to do that today.

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:11.470 align:middle line:90%
So how do they diversify?

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:14.410 align:middle line:84%
Well, in a village
Aurepalle, which

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:18.450 align:middle line:84%
was under the auspices of
the Institute for Crops

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:22.810 align:middle line:84%
in the Semi-Arid
Tropics, ICRISAT, farmers

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:24.520 align:middle line:90%
are a poly-growth sorghum.

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:25.780 align:middle line:90%
They grow castor.

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:28.120 align:middle line:90%
Sorghum is a grain like wheat.

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:32.230 align:middle line:84%
Castor you may have heard
of as in castor oil.

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:34.840 align:middle line:84%
It's both used in
diet, but also, it

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:38.410 align:middle line:84%
turns out to be a
lubricant for jet engines.

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:44.020 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, the coefficients of
variation are 0.5 and about 1.

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:47.230 align:middle line:84%
Now, you may not remember
that in medieval villages,

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:49.540 align:middle line:84%
we talked about a
very risky environment

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:51.970 align:middle line:84%
with the coefficient
of variation of yields

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:56.560 align:middle line:84%
of about 0.35 or something
like that, which delivered

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.640 align:middle line:90%
a disaster every 12 years.

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:01.990 align:middle line:84%
So it's more risky than
that taking any one crop

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:02.950 align:middle line:90%
one at a time.

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:05.740 align:middle line:84%
But they can
diversify over crops.

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:08.860 align:middle line:84%
So looking at the
crop correlation,

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:13.285 align:middle line:84%
those numbers range
from 0.09 to 0.81.

00:06:13.285 --> 00:06:17.200 align:middle line:84%
At .09, it's almost the
case that the yields

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:20.290 align:middle line:84%
on one type of crop are
independent of the yields

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:21.880 align:middle line:90%
on the other one.

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:25.390 align:middle line:84%
Again, you can go back and look
at the lecture under Consumer

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:27.940 align:middle line:84%
Preferences where we
were introducing risk

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:30.820 align:middle line:84%
and derived these
kinds of statistics.

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:34.000 align:middle line:84%
Soil isn't uniform
either, so even taking

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.190 align:middle line:84%
as given that they're
going to do castor,

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:39.290 align:middle line:84%
they can plant it in one
type of soil or another.

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:42.610 align:middle line:84%
Each type is risky with a
coefficient of variation

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:45.640 align:middle line:84%
from 0.7 to, again,
a little over 1.

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:49.270 align:middle line:84%
But you can diversify
over soil as well

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:53.800 align:middle line:84%
with a correlation of only 0.37,
so pretty good diversification

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:55.570 align:middle line:90%
possibilities.

00:06:55.570 --> 00:07:00.250 align:middle line:84%
That said, households don't hold
completely balanced portfolios

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:01.900 align:middle line:90%
across soils and crops.

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:05.050 align:middle line:84%
One household will plant more
of one crop than the other,

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:09.670 align:middle line:84%
or for castor, have more of
one type of soil than the other

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:12.610 align:middle line:84%
despite all the
diversification possibilities.

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:18.310 align:middle line:84%
And going outwards from crops
to other income-generating

00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:22.690 align:middle line:84%
activities, they can
engage in wage labor.

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:27.880 align:middle line:84%
They can do trade in
handicrafts or animal husbandry.

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:31.510 align:middle line:84%
So for example, trade in
handicrafts in Aurepalle

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:35.920 align:middle line:84%
consists of climbing
palm trees to get

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:40.000 align:middle line:84%
the fruit from which they will
make palm liquor, for example.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.430 align:middle line:84%
And it's a pretty
specialized activity.

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:46.300 align:middle line:84%
It looks like telephone
repairmen climbing poles

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:50.080 align:middle line:84%
with pretty heavy
and fancy equipment.

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:54.290 align:middle line:84%
Animal husbandry consists of
grazing animals and so on.

00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:57.250 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, if you look at
how much land they hold,

00:07:57.250 --> 00:08:02.140 align:middle line:84%
it varies from no land at all to
being a small holder or medium

00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:03.710 align:middle line:90%
or large holder.

00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:07.400 align:middle line:84%
And so for example,
not surprisingly,

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:09.520 align:middle line:84%
the more land they
have, the more

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:14.560 align:middle line:84%
is their income from crops,
going from about 2% to 56%

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:15.940 align:middle line:90%
of the total income.

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:19.630 align:middle line:84%
Likewise, when they hold very
little land, most of the income

00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:22.300 align:middle line:84%
is from labor, wage
labor, and that

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:26.830 align:middle line:84%
drops to 4% for the rich
guys, large landholders

00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:29.500 align:middle line:90%
in the village, and so on.

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:32.770 align:middle line:84%
Those patterns are pretty
much repeated in the other two

00:08:32.770 --> 00:08:35.650 align:middle line:84%
villages, and
Kanzara especially.

00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:38.559 align:middle line:84%
Shirapur is much
flatter in the sense

00:08:38.559 --> 00:08:41.980 align:middle line:84%
that we don't see very
sharp gradients in terms

00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:45.790 align:middle line:84%
of percentage of income
from various sources

00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:47.290 align:middle line:90%
as we move from small.

00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:50.440 align:middle line:84%
So villages are
kind of a metaphor.

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:52.638 align:middle line:90%
Villages are not all alike.

00:08:52.638 --> 00:08:54.430 align:middle line:84%
But the techniques
we're going to use today

00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:56.920 align:middle line:84%
do take into account
the differences.

00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:58.690 align:middle line:84%
Now let's look at
diversification

00:08:58.690 --> 00:09:03.260 align:middle line:84%
over income sources the way we
did for crops and soil types.

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:07.810 align:middle line:84%
This is a little bit difficult
to read, and I'll tell you why.

00:09:07.810 --> 00:09:12.760 align:middle line:84%
Going down the diagonal here
is the coefficient of variation

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:14.210 align:middle line:90%
of each income source.

00:09:14.210 --> 00:09:17.680 align:middle line:84%
So for example,
crop production is

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:21.730 align:middle line:84%
quite risky with a coefficient
of 0.42, which I almost

00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:24.220 align:middle line:90%
said a minute ago.

00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:29.530 align:middle line:84%
Of livestock income, the
CV is 0.21, et cetera.

00:09:29.530 --> 00:09:32.050 align:middle line:84%
Now, these other off
diagonal elements

00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:35.200 align:middle line:90%
here represent the covariation.

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:38.650 align:middle line:84%
So what would have
been better would

00:09:38.650 --> 00:09:42.100 align:middle line:84%
have been to list profits,
livestock, income,

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:44.560 align:middle line:84%
earned wages, and
trade and handicrafts

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:47.320 align:middle line:84%
going down the rows,
and then picking

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:51.860 align:middle line:84%
a row, move across the column
to find the covariance.

00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:55.090 align:middle line:84%
So for example, this guy
here is the covariance

00:09:55.090 --> 00:09:58.700 align:middle line:84%
between profits from crop
production and livestock

00:09:58.700 --> 00:09:59.200 align:middle line:90%
income.

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:01.130 align:middle line:90%
And it's actually negative.

00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:05.350 align:middle line:84%
So huge diversification
possibilities for a household

00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:08.800 align:middle line:84%
if they were doing both
crops and livestock.

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:12.040 align:middle line:84%
These lower
off-diagonal elements

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:15.370 align:middle line:84%
are not filled in because
the matrix is symmetric.

00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:19.300 align:middle line:84%
The covariation of
activity i with activity j

00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:22.840 align:middle line:84%
is the same as the
variation of i with i.

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:25.450 align:middle line:84%
So it would be redundant
to fill them all in,

00:10:25.450 --> 00:10:29.370 align:middle line:84%
and they were deleted to
make it easier to read.

00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:32.990 align:middle line:84%
So taking into account different
soils, different crops,

00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:35.720 align:middle line:84%
different income sources,
piling them all together,

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:39.870 align:middle line:84%
and plotting income over
the 10 years for which we

00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:44.730 align:middle line:84%
have the data, we look
what happens over time

00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:50.200 align:middle line:90%
from 1976 to 1985, essentially.

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:52.990 align:middle line:84%
And what's getting
plotted is not just

00:10:52.990 --> 00:10:56.130 align:middle line:84%
the time series
of one household.

00:10:56.130 --> 00:10:57.860 align:middle line:84%
All of them are
getting plotted here.

00:10:57.860 --> 00:11:02.030 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the way
the data were coded,

00:11:02.030 --> 00:11:05.000 align:middle line:84%
low numbers correspond
to little or no land,

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.630 align:middle line:84%
and high numbers
correspond to lots of land.

00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:12.650 align:middle line:84%
So as we move backwards
along the household number,

00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:15.320 align:middle line:84%
the households are
getting more and more land

00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:17.480 align:middle line:90%
and are actually--

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:20.460 align:middle line:90%
net worth is going up.

00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:22.560 align:middle line:84%
So that 1% of the
population that

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:26.520 align:middle line:84%
owns 50% of the wealth,
that's this guy back here.

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:31.920 align:middle line:84%
Now, I refer to this graph
as the Rocky Mountains

00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:34.140 align:middle line:84%
because you can
see all the peaks--

00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:34.980 align:middle line:90%
well, not quite.

00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:38.480 align:middle line:84%
I was going to say you can
see all the peaks and valleys.

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:39.800 align:middle line:90%
That's wrong.

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:44.430 align:middle line:84%
When you have a peak, you
can't see the valley behind it.

00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:48.420 align:middle line:84%
If all these incomes
communed with each other,

00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:51.160 align:middle line:84%
then everyone's peak would
happen at the same time,

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:53.220 align:middle line:90%
and it would look like waves.

00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:56.730 align:middle line:84%
Instead, we see this rather
jagged, sharp picture.

00:11:56.730 --> 00:12:00.120 align:middle line:84%
And again, when you're able
to see the valley behind,

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:02.520 align:middle line:84%
it's because there's not
a peak in front of it.

00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:05.310 align:middle line:84%
Now, the other thing is
moving along this gradient--

00:12:05.310 --> 00:12:08.730 align:middle line:84%
I should have pointed this out
earlier-- there is a 0 here.

00:12:08.730 --> 00:12:13.080 align:middle line:84%
This 0 corresponds to the
overall average of income

00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:15.970 align:middle line:84%
both over households
and over time.

00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:19.230 align:middle line:84%
So these guys are
below-average income.

00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:22.020 align:middle line:84%
These guys behind it are
higher-average income.

00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:25.020 align:middle line:84%
And again, you can see
that that's quite a salient

00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:26.980 align:middle line:90%
gradient.

00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:30.880 align:middle line:84%
Here is the corresponding
picture for grain.

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:33.850 align:middle line:84%
And I could have plotted
all consumption items,

00:12:33.850 --> 00:12:35.410 align:middle line:84%
but it would have
looked similar.

00:12:35.410 --> 00:12:37.690 align:middle line:90%
The paper actually does that.

00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:42.370 align:middle line:84%
When I say corresponding, I
mean the scale hasn't changed.

00:12:42.370 --> 00:12:47.200 align:middle line:84%
The scale that was used to
plot income, 4,000 at the peak,

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:51.670 align:middle line:84%
is the same as the scale that's
being used to plot consumption.

00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:55.200 align:middle line:84%
So you can see everybody's
consumption is compressed,

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:57.310 align:middle line:90%
so they're smoothing.

00:12:57.310 --> 00:12:59.560 align:middle line:90%
They're smoothing over time.

00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:02.380 align:middle line:84%
And to a degree
there, a large degree,

00:13:02.380 --> 00:13:06.130 align:middle line:84%
they're actually smoothing
over households as well.

00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:08.770 align:middle line:84%
Those very wealthy
guys are consuming

00:13:08.770 --> 00:13:11.470 align:middle line:84%
more than the poor guys
but not nearly as much

00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:17.270 align:middle line:84%
as income is higher for them
relative to income of low guys.

00:13:17.270 --> 00:13:19.620 align:middle line:84%
The main point of
the picture, however,

00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:23.390 align:middle line:84%
is that here, you can
almost see the waves.

00:13:23.390 --> 00:13:26.780 align:middle line:84%
Grain consumption is
kind of co-moving.

00:13:26.780 --> 00:13:29.420 align:middle line:84%
That would be easier to
see if we blew it up,

00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:31.310 align:middle line:84%
but we will look at
this statistically

00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:34.820 align:middle line:84%
as well in a few
subsequent slides.

00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:37.100 align:middle line:90%
And I refer to this as Kansas.

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:40.580 align:middle line:84%
I don't if any of you
have ever been in Kansas.

00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:44.510 align:middle line:84%
I ask this every time
I teach this diagram.

00:13:44.510 --> 00:13:47.000 align:middle line:84%
At one point, some
student in the class

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.290 align:middle line:90%
said, I'm from Kansas.

00:13:48.290 --> 00:13:49.430 align:middle line:90%
And I said, oh, I'm sorry.

00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:51.057 align:middle line:90%
I hope I haven't insulted you.

00:13:51.057 --> 00:13:51.890 align:middle line:90%
And he said, no, no.

00:13:51.890 --> 00:13:54.680 align:middle line:90%
It is really boring there.

00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:55.790 align:middle line:90%
So I like Kansas.

00:13:55.790 --> 00:13:56.780 align:middle line:90%
I'm not saying that.

00:13:56.780 --> 00:13:59.990 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, amber
waves of grain,

00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:03.330 align:middle line:90%
so consumption versus income.

00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:05.990 align:middle line:84%
So let's think about
a theory to try

00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:09.810 align:middle line:84%
to explain the difference
between those two diagrams.

00:14:09.810 --> 00:14:12.570 align:middle line:84%
And this is the bit that's
a little bit of a review,

00:14:12.570 --> 00:14:14.020 align:middle line:90%
but I think a useful one.

00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:17.250 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to talk
about individual k

00:14:17.250 --> 00:14:20.310 align:middle line:84%
alive at date t
that has experienced

00:14:20.310 --> 00:14:23.830 align:middle line:90%
a history of shocks ht.

00:14:23.830 --> 00:14:27.150 align:middle line:84%
This history is the shock at
date 1, the shock at date 2,

00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:29.340 align:middle line:90%
and the shock at date 3.

00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:34.170 align:middle line:84%
So again, this is the
state space representation

00:14:34.170 --> 00:14:37.620 align:middle line:84%
of the tree that
you saw in Debreu,

00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:40.290 align:middle line:84%
and I featured at
least twice already.

00:14:40.290 --> 00:14:42.010 align:middle line:90%
What is the objective function?

00:14:42.010 --> 00:14:44.460 align:middle line:84%
We're going to solve
that programming problem

00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:47.640 align:middle line:84%
to go back and forth between
solutions to that problem

00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:49.770 align:middle line:90%
in Pareto optimal allocations.

00:14:49.770 --> 00:14:53.160 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to maximize
a lambda-weighted sum

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:55.710 align:middle line:84%
of discounted
expected utilities,

00:14:55.710 --> 00:14:59.790 align:middle line:84%
weighted lambda k for weight
k over all the individuals

00:14:59.790 --> 00:15:01.890 align:middle line:90%
and their capital M of them.

00:15:01.890 --> 00:15:06.450 align:middle line:84%
The contemporary utility
functions have as arguments

00:15:06.450 --> 00:15:10.320 align:middle line:84%
the consumption of individual k
at date thq, which we just did,

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:13.950 align:middle line:90%
and then this age-gender index.

00:15:13.950 --> 00:15:16.440 align:middle line:90%
So not everyone is the same age.

00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:18.960 align:middle line:90%
Not everyone is the same gender.

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:21.810 align:middle line:84%
18-year-old males
eat twice as much

00:15:21.810 --> 00:15:23.610 align:middle line:90%
as anybody else, essentially.

00:15:23.610 --> 00:15:26.130 align:middle line:84%
So we want to adjust
the utility for

00:15:26.130 --> 00:15:28.440 align:middle line:90%
these metabolic requirements.

00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:33.510 align:middle line:84%
And they may not be treating
the women very equitably either.

00:15:33.510 --> 00:15:36.900 align:middle line:84%
But we are going to take these
as metabolic weights that were

00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:40.060 align:middle line:90%
measured in a dietary survey.

00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:44.670 align:middle line:84%
So the other objects
here are the probability

00:15:44.670 --> 00:15:47.190 align:middle line:84%
of that history
actually happening.

00:15:47.190 --> 00:15:52.320 align:middle line:84%
Note that for any day t, we
sum over all possible histories

00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:56.980 align:middle line:84%
that could have generated
that node at date t.

00:15:56.980 --> 00:15:59.450 align:middle line:84%
And then in addition,
there are multiple dates,

00:15:59.450 --> 00:16:03.460 align:middle line:84%
so we sum over those dates
and discount them by beta.

00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:06.310 align:middle line:84%
And again, the lambdas
are the Pareto weights

00:16:06.310 --> 00:16:09.220 align:middle line:84%
that vary between 0 and
1, and they sum to 1,

00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:11.170 align:middle line:90%
and we take the weighted sum.

00:16:11.170 --> 00:16:13.720 align:middle line:84%
There are many, many
resource constraints.

00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:16.840 align:middle line:84%
There is a particular
constraint for every date t

00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:18.700 align:middle line:84%
and all possible
histories that could

00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:22.390 align:middle line:84%
have led to t that simply
says that the way you hand out

00:16:22.390 --> 00:16:26.020 align:middle line:84%
consumption must not
sum to something greater

00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:28.450 align:middle line:90%
than the total that's available.

00:16:28.450 --> 00:16:30.370 align:middle line:84%
So usually, we
talk about income.

00:16:30.370 --> 00:16:33.250 align:middle line:84%
Now we just went to
total expenditure.

00:16:33.250 --> 00:16:37.480 align:middle line:84%
But obviously, whatever
income is, if it were spent,

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:39.520 align:middle line:84%
it would lead to
expenditure, and then you

00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:40.690 align:middle line:90%
could reallocate it.

00:16:40.690 --> 00:16:44.080 align:middle line:84%
And some people might be
consuming more than others.

00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:47.980 align:middle line:84%
But here we take the total
aggregate consumption as fixed.

00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:49.870 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to
put labor in here.

00:16:49.870 --> 00:16:51.850 align:middle line:90%
There's just consumption.

00:16:51.850 --> 00:16:54.470 align:middle line:84%
And we get first-order
conditions.

00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:58.150 align:middle line:84%
So if you pick a particular
consumption for a household

00:16:58.150 --> 00:17:02.650 align:middle line:84%
k at day t as a function
of a particular history ht,

00:17:02.650 --> 00:17:06.010 align:middle line:84%
it would appear in the
w contemporary utility

00:17:06.010 --> 00:17:11.290 align:middle line:84%
function with the prime for the
derivative weighted by lambda k

00:17:11.290 --> 00:17:14.260 align:middle line:84%
And that beta to the
t probability of ht

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:17.150 align:middle line:84%
would also be over there,
but we've multiplied through.

00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:20.599 align:middle line:84%
So that now becomes a
term in the denominator.

00:17:20.599 --> 00:17:23.109 align:middle line:84%
And the numerator
term here is mu.

00:17:23.109 --> 00:17:24.530 align:middle line:90%
So let me go back.

00:17:24.530 --> 00:17:28.150 align:middle line:84%
So the mu is the
Lagrange multiplier

00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:30.560 align:middle line:90%
on this resource constraint.

00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:35.320 align:middle line:84%
And it really should have a mu
indexed by t and the history

00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:38.230 align:middle line:84%
h of t because there is
a constraint like this

00:17:38.230 --> 00:17:41.540 align:middle line:84%
for every single possible
history end date.

00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:43.570 align:middle line:84%
So there are many,
many constraints.

00:17:43.570 --> 00:17:45.100 align:middle line:84%
That's why I caught
myself when I

00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:46.570 align:middle line:90%
said subject to one constraint.

00:17:46.570 --> 00:17:47.590 align:middle line:90%
That's wrong.

00:17:47.590 --> 00:17:49.480 align:middle line:84%
There's only one
good, but there's

00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:52.060 align:middle line:90%
many dates and many states.

00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:53.800 align:middle line:90%
The mu that's appearing here--

00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:57.370 align:middle line:84%
I didn't write an
additional little t which

00:17:57.370 --> 00:17:58.720 align:middle line:90%
ought to be there probably.

00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:02.650 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, mu tilde is
the normalized version

00:18:02.650 --> 00:18:04.570 align:middle line:84%
after dividing through
by the discount

00:18:04.570 --> 00:18:06.500 align:middle line:90%
rate and the probability.

00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:09.850 align:middle line:84%
And if you started with
particular utility functions

00:18:09.850 --> 00:18:13.990 align:middle line:84%
like one of our favorites,
constant exponential utility,

00:18:13.990 --> 00:18:16.970 align:middle line:84%
where sigma is the
degree of risk aversion,

00:18:16.970 --> 00:18:18.550 align:middle line:90%
it is of this form.

00:18:18.550 --> 00:18:20.840 align:middle line:84%
Now, there is a step
that's happening here

00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:24.730 align:middle line:84%
which is imposing the way
that these age and gender

00:18:24.730 --> 00:18:27.580 align:middle line:84%
weights are entering into
the utility function.

00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:31.810 align:middle line:84%
Namely, it's consumption
per unit index.

00:18:31.810 --> 00:18:35.950 align:middle line:84%
So pick a 30-year-old male
and then look at the other age

00:18:35.950 --> 00:18:37.510 align:middle line:90%
groups and the other genders.

00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:39.010 align:middle line:84%
And the question
is whether they're

00:18:39.010 --> 00:18:43.480 align:middle line:84%
consuming more or consuming
less than that baseline case.

00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:47.410 align:middle line:84%
So we, for short, can talk about
this consumption per unit age.

00:18:47.410 --> 00:18:51.400 align:middle line:84%
That's really the object that's
entering into individual K's

00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:52.870 align:middle line:90%
utility function.

00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:56.890 align:middle line:84%
And c tilde then replaces
that normalized consumption c

00:18:56.890 --> 00:18:58.000 align:middle line:90%
over a.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.990 align:middle line:84%
And when you do the math, you'll
get the consumption formula,

00:19:01.990 --> 00:19:04.340 align:middle line:84%
the risk-sharing
formula, as it were.

00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:07.600 align:middle line:84%
So this is the
per-unit consumption

00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:10.600 align:middle line:84%
of household
individual K at date t.

00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:13.660 align:middle line:84%
It has an intercept
term, a term that

00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:15.940 align:middle line:84%
depends on the
demographics, and a term

00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:20.110 align:middle line:84%
that depends on this Pareto,
this shadow price mu.

00:19:20.110 --> 00:19:22.840 align:middle line:84%
You've kind of seen this
before, but let me remind you

00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:25.450 align:middle line:84%
this intercept term,
quite logically, has

00:19:25.450 --> 00:19:26.780 align:middle line:90%
to do with the Pareto weight.

00:19:26.780 --> 00:19:29.410 align:middle line:84%
The higher is the Pareto
weight of individual K,

00:19:29.410 --> 00:19:31.540 align:middle line:84%
the higher is the log
of the Pareto weight,

00:19:31.540 --> 00:19:35.290 align:middle line:84%
it's normalized by this
degree of risk aversion.

00:19:35.290 --> 00:19:39.370 align:middle line:84%
If we move over
here to the mu term,

00:19:39.370 --> 00:19:42.460 align:middle line:84%
mu is the shadow
price of consumption.

00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:44.380 align:middle line:84%
It's how much the
objective function

00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:46.840 align:middle line:84%
would increase if you
increase consumption

00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:50.330 align:middle line:84%
by an infinitesimally small
amount in the aggregate.

00:19:50.330 --> 00:19:54.860 align:middle line:84%
So as mu goes up,
consumption is going down.

00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:55.750 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:19:55.750 --> 00:19:57.430 align:middle line:90%
Mu is the shadow price.

00:19:57.430 --> 00:19:59.890 align:middle line:84%
So the lower is
aggregate consumption.

00:19:59.890 --> 00:20:01.880 align:middle line:84%
The higher will be
the shadow price.

00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:04.660 align:middle line:84%
So as mu goes up, there's
less consumption to go around,

00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:07.690 align:middle line:84%
so individual consumption
is also dropping.

00:20:07.690 --> 00:20:10.180 align:middle line:84%
And we will replace this
by aggregate consumption

00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:13.390 align:middle line:84%
and get a positive
sign momentarily.

00:20:13.390 --> 00:20:15.550 align:middle line:84%
The other interesting
thing about this equation

00:20:15.550 --> 00:20:18.940 align:middle line:84%
is, again, this 1 over sigma
which I feature in this term,

00:20:18.940 --> 00:20:21.190 align:middle line:84%
although it's on all
the other ones as well.

00:20:21.190 --> 00:20:25.000 align:middle line:84%
And that is if individual
risk aversion goes up,

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.400 align:middle line:90%
this coefficient is going down.

00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:31.480 align:middle line:84%
So as risk aversion goes
up, this individual K

00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:34.000 align:middle line:84%
should not experience
too much variation

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.540 align:middle line:84%
in his or her consumption
when the aggregate is moving

00:20:37.540 --> 00:20:40.630 align:middle line:84%
because other people would
be in a better position

00:20:40.630 --> 00:20:43.600 align:middle line:84%
to absorb the aggregate
shock if they were

00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:46.330 align:middle line:84%
less-risk averse
than individual K.

00:20:46.330 --> 00:20:49.810 align:middle line:84%
And again, you'll
see that momentarily.

00:20:49.810 --> 00:20:51.660 align:middle line:90%
Questions?

00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:54.260 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: My question
is why there

00:20:54.260 --> 00:21:01.430 align:middle line:84%
was a negative sign before
the A, log A, the age and sex

00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:02.810 align:middle line:90%
index.

00:21:02.810 --> 00:21:07.810 align:middle line:84%
It looks like in the utility
function when A goes up,

00:21:07.810 --> 00:21:09.520 align:middle line:90%
the utility will go up.

00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:13.960 align:middle line:90%


00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:15.460 align:middle line:84%
ROBERT TOWNSEND:
When A is going up,

00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:21.810 align:middle line:84%
though, consumption per
unit age is going down.

00:21:21.810 --> 00:21:24.120 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: But in the
utility function--

00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:26.530 align:middle line:84%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: And they're
becoming more urgent,

00:21:26.530 --> 00:21:29.680 align:middle line:90%
so to speak, other things equal.

00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:34.980 align:middle line:90%
So I'm sorry.

00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:38.690 align:middle line:84%
I think I said it
right the first time.

00:21:38.690 --> 00:21:42.740 align:middle line:84%
Holding aggregate consumption
fixed, for example,

00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:47.330 align:middle line:84%
as their index is going up,
the consumption per unit index

00:21:47.330 --> 00:21:48.410 align:middle line:90%
is going down.

00:21:48.410 --> 00:21:49.812 align:middle line:90%
And that's the negative sign.

00:21:49.812 --> 00:21:51.020 align:middle line:90%
It's really just that simple.

00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:57.400 align:middle line:90%


00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:59.090 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:21:59.090 --> 00:22:02.660 align:middle line:84%
But thank you for
asking the question.

00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:03.160 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:05.860 align:middle line:84%
Now, that was just
one individual.

00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:10.270 align:middle line:84%
We can put all the individuals
together and allow explicitly

00:22:10.270 --> 00:22:12.220 align:middle line:90%
for different risk aversion.

00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:14.080 align:middle line:84%
And this formula
appears in the paper,

00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:16.060 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not going
to try to derive it.

00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:19.520 align:middle line:90%
It's somewhat tedious algebra.

00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:21.340 align:middle line:90%
But the interpretation is easy.

00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:23.950 align:middle line:84%
Namely, there's an
intercept, something

00:22:23.950 --> 00:22:26.440 align:middle line:84%
to do with demographics,
and something

00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:29.590 align:middle line:84%
to do with aggregate
consumption.

00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:32.860 align:middle line:84%
In a little bit more
detail, this is no longer

00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:34.720 align:middle line:90%
individual I consumption.

00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:38.170 align:middle line:84%
It's all the individuals
in a household J.

00:22:38.170 --> 00:22:40.240 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately, that's
all we see in the data.

00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:44.080 align:middle line:84%
We don't see individual eating
apart from that dietary survey.

00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:47.170 align:middle line:84%
We just see aggregate
household consumption.

00:22:47.170 --> 00:22:48.970 align:middle line:84%
But that functional
form allowed us

00:22:48.970 --> 00:22:51.370 align:middle line:84%
to sum up over all
the consumptions,

00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:52.780 align:middle line:90%
and that's what we see.

00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:56.990 align:middle line:84%
And we also have the age
and sex of all the members.

00:22:56.990 --> 00:22:59.780 align:middle line:90%
So we also have the denominator.

00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:03.820 align:middle line:84%
So this is household-level
consumption per unit age.

00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:05.390 align:middle line:90%
And that should be higher.

00:23:05.390 --> 00:23:08.320 align:middle line:84%
The higher is household
J's lambda weight

00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:10.960 align:middle line:84%
relative to the lambda
weights of the other people

00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:13.210 align:middle line:90%
in the village.

00:23:13.210 --> 00:23:15.970 align:middle line:84%
It's a bit more complicated
because these lambda weights

00:23:15.970 --> 00:23:18.920 align:middle line:84%
are weighted by the
degree of risk aversion.

00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:22.630 align:middle line:84%
So it's a risk-aversion-weighted
version of the Lambda

00:23:22.630 --> 00:23:25.360 align:middle line:84%
that we care about,
comparing it to lambda

00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:28.960 align:middle line:90%
K. This is the demographic.

00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:30.260 align:middle line:90%
I may come back to that.

00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:33.320 align:middle line:84%
This is the formula now in
terms of aggregate consumption.

00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:37.840 align:middle line:84%
This is the consumption of
individual K and household J--

00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:41.350 align:middle line:84%
I, actually-- but then
summing over all households I.

00:23:41.350 --> 00:23:44.410 align:middle line:84%
So this is aggregate
consumption per unit age

00:23:44.410 --> 00:23:45.460 align:middle line:90%
in the whole village.

00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:49.330 align:middle line:84%
And again, you can see quite
explicitly that J's consumption

00:23:49.330 --> 00:23:52.390 align:middle line:84%
will move with that when
sigma J is going down,

00:23:52.390 --> 00:23:55.270 align:middle line:84%
or the other way around--
when household J is very risk

00:23:55.270 --> 00:23:57.880 align:middle line:84%
averse, this coefficient
is going to 0,

00:23:57.880 --> 00:23:59.800 align:middle line:84%
and individual
consumption would not

00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:01.630 align:middle line:90%
very much with the aggregate.

00:24:01.630 --> 00:24:05.530 align:middle line:84%
That's the aggregate
allocation of risk bearing.

00:24:05.530 --> 00:24:09.100 align:middle line:84%
Because the theory has those
age and gender weights in it,

00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:10.750 align:middle line:90%
you can treat those as shocks.

00:24:10.750 --> 00:24:13.660 align:middle line:84%
Even though they're quite
not moving in a surprise way,

00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:15.042 align:middle line:90%
they are moving over time.

00:24:15.042 --> 00:24:17.500 align:middle line:84%
They're moving intertemporally,
and maybe the whole village

00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:18.730 align:middle line:90%
is getting older.

00:24:18.730 --> 00:24:23.230 align:middle line:84%
Maybe one household is moving
across metabolic categories

00:24:23.230 --> 00:24:25.460 align:middle line:84%
faster than the
other households are.

00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:29.110 align:middle line:84%
And so the formula allows
for that adjustment,

00:24:29.110 --> 00:24:32.420 align:middle line:84%
comparing household
j to the other ones.

00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:37.330 align:middle line:84%
So let's look at an empirical
implication, a linear equation.

00:24:37.330 --> 00:24:41.440 align:middle line:84%
The aggregate consumption,
age weighted, of household

00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:44.410 align:middle line:90%
J has an intercept.

00:24:44.410 --> 00:24:46.840 align:middle line:84%
It depends on
aggregate consumption.

00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:50.890 align:middle line:84%
It depends on the
index of household J

00:24:50.890 --> 00:24:53.390 align:middle line:90%
and maybe on other things.

00:24:53.390 --> 00:24:56.410 align:middle line:90%
This is just a version of this.

00:24:56.410 --> 00:24:58.570 align:middle line:84%
Household J's
consumption depends

00:24:58.570 --> 00:25:02.440 align:middle line:84%
on an intercept, its age,
and aggregate consumption.

00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:04.960 align:middle line:84%
It's just much easier
to write this way.

00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:07.300 align:middle line:90%
And the theory has implications.

00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:10.510 align:middle line:84%
Namely, if everyone had
the same risk aversion,

00:25:10.510 --> 00:25:14.980 align:middle line:84%
then this beta J on aggregate
consumption would be 1.

00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:16.600 align:middle line:84%
You can convince
yourself this would

00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:21.550 align:middle line:84%
be 1 because the sigmas
are all alike, for example.

00:25:21.550 --> 00:25:25.720 align:middle line:84%
Likewise, this demographic thing
would have a coefficient of 1

00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:27.730 align:middle line:90%
over sigma, the common sigma.

00:25:27.730 --> 00:25:29.320 align:middle line:90%
And this other stuff--

00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:31.610 align:middle line:90%
I saved the best for last.

00:25:31.610 --> 00:25:35.140 align:middle line:84%
This is any other variable,
including household income.

00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:39.790 align:middle line:84%
And the theory is saying that
this coefficient should be 0.

00:25:39.790 --> 00:25:42.520 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's very
counterintuitive.

00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:46.270 align:middle line:84%
How could I possibly be claiming
that household consumption

00:25:46.270 --> 00:25:49.580 align:middle line:84%
doesn't depend on
household income?

00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:52.950 align:middle line:84%
What about marginal propensity
to consume and all of that?

00:25:52.950 --> 00:25:56.900 align:middle line:84%
Well, the answer is they're
pooling their incomes together

00:25:56.900 --> 00:26:00.320 align:middle line:84%
as if in a mutual fund
and then redistributing it

00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:02.600 align:middle line:84%
as a function of
the Pareto weights.

00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:06.270 align:middle line:84%
So household J's income
is kind of in there,

00:26:06.270 --> 00:26:08.630 align:middle line:84%
but it's in the pooled
version, and it shows up

00:26:08.630 --> 00:26:09.890 align:middle line:90%
in aggregate consumption.

00:26:09.890 --> 00:26:13.860 align:middle line:84%
And if you control for that,
then there's nothing leftover.

00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:18.440 align:middle line:84%
There's no idiosyncratic
risk for household J to bear.

00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:20.360 align:middle line:84%
Another way to say
that is we're going

00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:22.670 align:middle line:84%
to get perfect
consumption insurance

00:26:22.670 --> 00:26:25.160 align:middle line:84%
because, like a
large mutual fund,

00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:28.690 align:middle line:84%
all the individual
shocks go to 0.

00:26:28.690 --> 00:26:32.980 align:middle line:84%
A version of this in China
that I'm becoming aware of--

00:26:32.980 --> 00:26:36.310 align:middle line:84%
Alibaba runs a mutual
fund over health shocks.

00:26:36.310 --> 00:26:38.650 align:middle line:84%
There's 100 million
households joining,

00:26:38.650 --> 00:26:40.930 align:middle line:90%
and they pay ex-post premia.

00:26:40.930 --> 00:26:45.820 align:middle line:84%
Typical medical expense
must be as high as $20,000.

00:26:45.820 --> 00:26:50.750 align:middle line:84%
How much do they pay in?
$9 in yuan equivalent.

00:26:50.750 --> 00:26:54.290 align:middle line:84%
So when you spread that damage
of an individual household,

00:26:54.290 --> 00:26:57.470 align:middle line:84%
which is high, over
all the hundreds

00:26:57.470 --> 00:27:00.980 align:middle line:84%
of thousands of households,
it almost goes to 0.

00:27:00.980 --> 00:27:04.130 align:middle line:84%
And this is the extreme
version of perfect pooling.

00:27:04.130 --> 00:27:09.440 align:middle line:84%
That's contemporary China, not
a village in India in 1985.

00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:12.440 align:middle line:84%
So we can test the theory by
looking at each household one

00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:15.380 align:middle line:84%
at a time over the 10 years,
and we can test the theory

00:27:15.380 --> 00:27:17.870 align:middle line:84%
by pooling households
together into one

00:27:17.870 --> 00:27:21.650 align:middle line:84%
big cross-sectional
time-dependent regression.

00:27:21.650 --> 00:27:25.400 align:middle line:84%
This is a little hard to
see, but what's going on here

00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:29.990 align:middle line:84%
statistically is testing
these coefficients xe, which

00:27:29.990 --> 00:27:33.710 align:middle line:84%
should be 0, to see whether
they actually are in practice.

00:27:33.710 --> 00:27:37.010 align:middle line:84%
Under the null
hypothesis that it's 0,

00:27:37.010 --> 00:27:40.190 align:middle line:84%
can you reject in a
statistically significant way

00:27:40.190 --> 00:27:43.010 align:middle line:84%
that it's greater
than 0 or less than 0?

00:27:43.010 --> 00:27:47.390 align:middle line:84%
And for most households,
the bulk of the households,

00:27:47.390 --> 00:27:50.330 align:middle line:84%
you can't reject much
one way or the other.

00:27:50.330 --> 00:27:52.340 align:middle line:84%
There's just a
handful of households

00:27:52.340 --> 00:27:54.590 align:middle line:90%
on either side of the null.

00:27:54.590 --> 00:27:56.540 align:middle line:90%
This test has power.

00:27:56.540 --> 00:27:59.300 align:middle line:84%
This thing is, oh, well,
maybe it's just noisy data,

00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:01.490 align:middle line:84%
and we can't infer
much of anything.

00:28:01.490 --> 00:28:03.410 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they're literally
hand-to-mouth,

00:28:03.410 --> 00:28:06.060 align:middle line:84%
and they're eating entirely
their income, in which case

00:28:06.060 --> 00:28:08.210 align:middle line:90%
the coefficient would be 1.

00:28:08.210 --> 00:28:12.990 align:middle line:84%
And we can't reject
that for half of them.

00:28:12.990 --> 00:28:15.770 align:middle line:84%
But for the other half,
we can statistically

00:28:15.770 --> 00:28:18.320 align:middle line:90%
reject that it's 1.

00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:20.990 align:middle line:84%
So there is a lot of
smoothing going on.

00:28:20.990 --> 00:28:24.950 align:middle line:84%
And this is for the other
two villages down here.

00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:28.970 align:middle line:84%
Now let's talk about
pooling it together.

00:28:28.970 --> 00:28:32.040 align:middle line:84%
Actually, let's just jump
here, and then I'll go back.

00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:33.290 align:middle line:90%
So here's the villages--

00:28:33.290 --> 00:28:36.050 align:middle line:90%
Aurepalle, Shirapur, Kandara.

00:28:36.050 --> 00:28:39.830 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to somehow
take each household over time

00:28:39.830 --> 00:28:42.920 align:middle line:84%
and take households
in the cross-section

00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:45.320 align:middle line:84%
and come up with a
coefficient on how much

00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:50.840 align:middle line:84%
consumption is moving on
average with household income.

00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:52.750 align:middle line:90%
And the answer is roughly--

00:28:52.750 --> 00:28:54.040 align:middle line:90%
should be in rupees--

00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:56.810 align:middle line:90%
$0.07 for the dollar.

00:28:56.810 --> 00:28:59.860 align:middle line:84%
So for every dollar
change in income,

00:28:59.860 --> 00:29:04.060 align:middle line:84%
consumption is
moving by only $0.07.

00:29:04.060 --> 00:29:05.050 align:middle line:90%
It's positive.

00:29:05.050 --> 00:29:07.060 align:middle line:90%
It's statistically significant.

00:29:07.060 --> 00:29:09.380 align:middle line:90%
We now reject the model.

00:29:09.380 --> 00:29:11.650 align:middle line:84%
But as an approximation,
we're doing

00:29:11.650 --> 00:29:14.920 align:middle line:84%
quite well because these
coefficients are small.

00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:18.160 align:middle line:84%
So most, although
not all, of the

00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:22.150 align:middle line:84%
household-specific idiosyncratic
risk is being pooled.

00:29:22.150 --> 00:29:25.660 align:middle line:84%
And you can peruse
this table and see--

00:29:25.660 --> 00:29:30.820 align:middle line:84%
this is profits as opposed
to all income, labor income,

00:29:30.820 --> 00:29:33.230 align:middle line:84%
profits from trade
and handicraft.

00:29:33.230 --> 00:29:35.420 align:middle line:84%
You can look for
the high numbers.

00:29:35.420 --> 00:29:37.990 align:middle line:84%
So there are certain
activities in certain villages

00:29:37.990 --> 00:29:40.480 align:middle line:84%
that look relatively
under-insured.

00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:43.440 align:middle line:84%
This is who's the
most vulnerable.

00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:45.870 align:middle line:84%
If we had the ability
to come in externally

00:29:45.870 --> 00:29:48.270 align:middle line:84%
and introduce a better
insurance product,

00:29:48.270 --> 00:29:51.330 align:middle line:84%
we would want to offer it
to households that need it.

00:29:51.330 --> 00:29:54.720 align:middle line:84%
Or if no one needed it, we
would expect take-up to be zero.

00:29:54.720 --> 00:30:00.090 align:middle line:84%
So labor incomes had a pretty
high coefficient in Shirapur

00:30:00.090 --> 00:30:00.820 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:30:00.820 --> 00:30:03.400 align:middle line:90%
But a lot of these are 0--

00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:06.430 align:middle line:84%
that is to say, not
statistically different from 0.

00:30:06.430 --> 00:30:09.910 align:middle line:84%
So in that sense, it's
a good approximation.

00:30:09.910 --> 00:30:14.470 align:middle line:84%
Remember, according to Lucas,
models are abstractions.

00:30:14.470 --> 00:30:18.040 align:middle line:84%
They're meant to be stylized
versions of reality.

00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:20.860 align:middle line:84%
Because we have a model,
we have an exact prediction

00:30:20.860 --> 00:30:22.810 align:middle line:90%
of what we should expect to see.

00:30:22.810 --> 00:30:24.430 align:middle line:84%
And through the
lens of the model,

00:30:24.430 --> 00:30:28.420 align:middle line:84%
we can decide how reality is
doing relative to the model.

00:30:28.420 --> 00:30:30.520 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not overly
alarmed that we're going

00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:32.920 align:middle line:90%
to get statistical rejections.

00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:35.770 align:middle line:84%
The question is, is it
a useful starting point

00:30:35.770 --> 00:30:37.610 align:middle line:90%
as an approximation?

00:30:37.610 --> 00:30:40.330 align:middle line:90%
And the answer seems to be yes.

00:30:40.330 --> 00:30:43.630 align:middle line:84%
I will share with you that
when I wrote this paper,

00:30:43.630 --> 00:30:46.540 align:middle line:84%
it kind of created
a firestorm of alarm

00:30:46.540 --> 00:30:49.900 align:middle line:84%
among policymakers
who were astounded

00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:54.400 align:middle line:84%
that poor households in villages
in the caste system, and so on,

00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:59.110 align:middle line:84%
could ever possibly be achieving
anything close to an optimum.

00:30:59.110 --> 00:31:03.340 align:middle line:84%
It just went against the grain
of their prior presumptions.

00:31:03.340 --> 00:31:05.540 align:middle line:90%
But it doesn't fit perfectly.

00:31:05.540 --> 00:31:08.440 align:middle line:84%
So this slide which I
deliberately skipped over just

00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:11.680 align:middle line:84%
now is to say, look,
maybe I'm getting

00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:15.790 align:middle line:84%
into statistical stuff a bit,
and we can follow up later.

00:31:15.790 --> 00:31:18.760 align:middle line:84%
One reason why this
coefficient might be low

00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:22.960 align:middle line:84%
is because this variable
x is very poorly measured.

00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:24.960 align:middle line:84%
Say it just got a lot
of measurement error

00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:26.200 align:middle line:90%
that is not real.

00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:29.940 align:middle line:84%
Then it's moving around a
lot for spurious reasons,

00:31:29.940 --> 00:31:32.530 align:middle line:84%
and you would not expect that
to influence consumption.

00:31:32.530 --> 00:31:36.090 align:middle line:84%
So that biases this coefficient
to something close to 0.

00:31:36.090 --> 00:31:40.050 align:middle line:84%
Fortunately, we can correct
for it with the panel.

00:31:40.050 --> 00:31:43.260 align:middle line:84%
And it's putting explicitly
this measurement error

00:31:43.260 --> 00:31:47.430 align:middle line:84%
into, in this case,
idiosyncratic income

00:31:47.430 --> 00:31:51.330 align:middle line:84%
and then substituting
that into those equations.

00:31:51.330 --> 00:31:54.870 align:middle line:84%
We now see a correlation
between the measurement error

00:31:54.870 --> 00:31:57.730 align:middle line:84%
and the measured
version of income,

00:31:57.730 --> 00:32:00.660 align:middle line:84%
which means you can't
run an OLS regression.

00:32:00.660 --> 00:32:03.000 align:middle line:84%
But on the other hand,
another way to do this

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:05.100 align:middle line:84%
is just to take
first differences.

00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:07.530 align:middle line:84%
Differences over
time over households

00:32:07.530 --> 00:32:08.940 align:middle line:90%
gives you another version.

00:32:08.940 --> 00:32:12.520 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out this
within coefficient

00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:17.880 align:middle line:84%
and this across-time coefficient
allow you to essentially get

00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:19.150 align:middle line:90%
rid of the measurement error.

00:32:19.150 --> 00:32:23.580 align:middle line:84%
So that's this IV
Griliches-Hausman thing,

00:32:23.580 --> 00:32:26.340 align:middle line:90%
which I'm not going to go over.

00:32:26.340 --> 00:32:30.210 align:middle line:84%
I still don't know what the
best strategy is for me.

00:32:30.210 --> 00:32:33.870 align:middle line:84%
If I skip stuff, then it looks
like it came out of nowhere,

00:32:33.870 --> 00:32:35.460 align:middle line:84%
and you don't really
understand it.

00:32:35.460 --> 00:32:38.790 align:middle line:84%
Hence, I try in all
these slides to show you

00:32:38.790 --> 00:32:40.480 align:middle line:90%
the steps that are being taken.

00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:42.990 align:middle line:84%
I'm deliberately not
concealing something from you.

00:32:42.990 --> 00:32:45.870 align:middle line:84%
But on the other hand,
this particular sequence

00:32:45.870 --> 00:32:49.230 align:middle line:84%
involves statistical material
you may not have seen

00:32:49.230 --> 00:32:51.040 align:middle line:90%
something similar to before.

00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:54.400 align:middle line:84%
So if it's still quite opaque,
don't worry too much about it.

00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:56.580 align:middle line:90%
I'm just trying to be clearer.

00:32:56.580 --> 00:32:57.210 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:32:57.210 --> 00:33:00.960 align:middle line:84%
So that's summary, risk and
insurance and village India.

00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:03.010 align:middle line:84%
These villages are
doing reasonably well,

00:33:03.010 --> 00:33:04.260 align:middle line:90%
although not perfectly.

00:33:04.260 --> 00:33:06.340 align:middle line:84%
They're sharing a
lot of the risk.

00:33:06.340 --> 00:33:08.490 align:middle line:84%
The reason that
consumption looks so flat

00:33:08.490 --> 00:33:12.600 align:middle line:84%
relative to income is because
they're actively, somehow

00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:15.420 align:middle line:84%
or another, engaged in
borrowing and lending

00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:19.900 align:middle line:84%
or transfers to bridge the gap
between consumption and income.

00:33:19.900 --> 00:33:22.990 align:middle line:84%
Now, another way they could
handle the situation--

00:33:22.990 --> 00:33:26.370 align:middle line:84%
so for this, we're going to
jump to medieval villages--

00:33:26.370 --> 00:33:30.060 align:middle line:84%
is to potentially
divide up the land.

00:33:30.060 --> 00:33:32.550 align:middle line:84%
So this is the
diversification part,

00:33:32.550 --> 00:33:35.040 align:middle line:84%
whether land holdings
of a typical village

00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:38.250 align:middle line:84%
would be consistent with the
optimal allocation of risk

00:33:38.250 --> 00:33:41.940 align:middle line:84%
predicted in that model
just now on the premise

00:33:41.940 --> 00:33:43.980 align:middle line:84%
that what you get
is what you eat.

00:33:43.980 --> 00:33:45.330 align:middle line:90%
You have these strips.

00:33:45.330 --> 00:33:47.040 align:middle line:90%
The strips are subject to risk.

00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:49.300 align:middle line:84%
You add it all up across
all your land holdings,

00:33:49.300 --> 00:33:50.100 align:middle line:90%
then you eat it.

00:33:50.100 --> 00:33:51.840 align:middle line:90%
So this is the other extreme--

00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:55.590 align:middle line:84%
no expo smoothing,
no credit markets.

00:33:55.590 --> 00:33:59.580 align:middle line:84%
Even going back to lecture 1
or something where I presented

00:33:59.580 --> 00:34:01.260 align:middle line:84%
all the different
economies-- we talked

00:34:01.260 --> 00:34:03.150 align:middle line:84%
about the medieval
village economy.

00:34:03.150 --> 00:34:06.870 align:middle line:84%
We're about to do it now in
terms of dividing up the land.

00:34:06.870 --> 00:34:09.120 align:middle line:84%
We also talked about
Thai village economy

00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:12.840 align:middle line:84%
with that temple where
households did not diversify.

00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:13.860 align:middle line:90%
Some had low land.

00:34:13.860 --> 00:34:15.360 align:middle line:90%
Some had high land.

00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:17.250 align:middle line:84%
They made donations
to the temple.

00:34:17.250 --> 00:34:20.909 align:middle line:84%
And people that had a
bad year, God gives back.

00:34:20.909 --> 00:34:26.909 align:middle line:84%
So the second thing is
what's going on in the first,

00:34:26.909 --> 00:34:29.880 align:middle line:84%
some mechanism for
risk sharing ex-post.

00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:32.429 align:middle line:84%
This is the mechanism
in the second, which

00:34:32.429 --> 00:34:35.310 align:middle line:90%
is ex-ante division of land.

00:34:35.310 --> 00:34:37.409 align:middle line:84%
I said that in reverse
order, but anyway.

00:34:37.409 --> 00:34:40.380 align:middle line:84%
So you've seen this
picture twice before.

00:34:40.380 --> 00:34:43.020 align:middle line:90%
This is Elford Stratfordshire.

00:34:43.020 --> 00:34:46.320 align:middle line:84%
Mr. Darlaston's land
is shaded in black,

00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:52.969 align:middle line:84%
and he's got something like 50
strips throughout the village.

00:34:52.969 --> 00:34:55.250 align:middle line:90%
So why were they doing that--

00:34:55.250 --> 00:34:58.980 align:middle line:84%
not just Mr. Darlaston, but
all of them to some degree?

00:34:58.980 --> 00:35:03.870 align:middle line:84%
So if you think about
this map, for example,

00:35:03.870 --> 00:35:08.200 align:middle line:84%
are these types of
land differ in some way

00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:12.340 align:middle line:84%
from these types of land
in terms of soil or slope

00:35:12.340 --> 00:35:13.750 align:middle line:90%
or elevation?

00:35:13.750 --> 00:35:16.720 align:middle line:84%
Or alternatively,
land is all alike.

00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:20.740 align:middle line:84%
And then the question is, when
the storm comes and destroys

00:35:20.740 --> 00:35:24.760 align:middle line:84%
crops, it could destroy
these crops and not these.

00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:26.770 align:middle line:84%
So there's really
two different models,

00:35:26.770 --> 00:35:28.930 align:middle line:84%
and we're only going
to have time to do one,

00:35:28.930 --> 00:35:30.310 align:middle line:84%
although the other
one is covered

00:35:30.310 --> 00:35:33.080 align:middle line:84%
in that missing medieval
village chapter.

00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:36.490 align:middle line:84%
We're going to do uniform
shocks on non-uniform land,

00:35:36.490 --> 00:35:41.720 align:middle line:84%
and the non-uniform shocks
we'll save for another time.

00:35:41.720 --> 00:35:43.820 align:middle line:90%
So there are two types of land.

00:35:43.820 --> 00:35:45.570 align:middle line:90%
Start off keeping this simple.

00:35:45.570 --> 00:35:49.400 align:middle line:90%
Say high-low or clay-sandy.

00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:53.450 align:middle line:84%
There's only two households,
another abstraction.

00:35:53.450 --> 00:35:55.130 align:middle line:90%
And there's only one date.

00:35:55.130 --> 00:35:59.810 align:middle line:84%
And land type k has
a yield vector which

00:35:59.810 --> 00:36:02.180 align:middle line:90%
varies with the shock epsilon.

00:36:02.180 --> 00:36:05.280 align:middle line:84%
And epsilon can take
on capital S values.

00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:08.820 align:middle line:84%
So this epsilon is a measure
of rainfall, temperature,

00:36:08.820 --> 00:36:12.260 align:middle line:84%
humidity, or other
events which have

00:36:12.260 --> 00:36:15.410 align:middle line:84%
beneficial or adverse
consequences for the yield

00:36:15.410 --> 00:36:19.700 align:middle line:84%
as captured by the way which
the yield of type k land

00:36:19.700 --> 00:36:21.680 align:middle line:90%
varies with those shocks.

00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:24.320 align:middle line:84%
You've, again, seen
this before a bit.

00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:28.640 align:middle line:84%
When we did the dynamics,
we planted land with seed

00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:33.150 align:middle line:84%
and talked about how the yield
could vary with low, medium,

00:36:33.150 --> 00:36:33.910 align:middle line:90%
and high shock.

00:36:33.910 --> 00:36:37.500 align:middle line:84%
So this is very
similar notation.

00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:40.340 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's be serious
even though we're

00:36:40.340 --> 00:36:41.810 align:middle line:90%
trying to keep this simple.

00:36:41.810 --> 00:36:46.180 align:middle line:84%
What numbers do we
use for this vector?

00:36:46.180 --> 00:36:49.990 align:middle line:84%
One thing we want to
capture is how much

00:36:49.990 --> 00:36:53.710 align:middle line:84%
that yield is varying as
measured by the coefficient

00:36:53.710 --> 00:36:54.910 align:middle line:90%
of variation.

00:36:54.910 --> 00:36:58.745 align:middle line:84%
And in medieval villages,
it was about 0.35,

00:36:58.745 --> 00:37:00.370 align:middle line:84%
which we've covered
before, and I'm not

00:37:00.370 --> 00:37:03.410 align:middle line:84%
going to go back and dig
up those slides for you.

00:37:03.410 --> 00:37:05.140 align:middle line:84%
But that was the
number we used before.

00:37:05.140 --> 00:37:07.120 align:middle line:90%
The other one is--

00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:11.260 align:middle line:84%
there's two types of land
here, k equal 1 or 2.

00:37:11.260 --> 00:37:15.310 align:middle line:84%
And we want to choose
vectors of returns for both.

00:37:15.310 --> 00:37:17.440 align:middle line:84%
So we want to capture
the covariance

00:37:17.440 --> 00:37:19.900 align:middle line:84%
in the two types of land,
how different are they

00:37:19.900 --> 00:37:21.560 align:middle line:90%
from one another.

00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:24.820 align:middle line:84%
And again, going back in the
earlier lecture, the estates

00:37:24.820 --> 00:37:30.040 align:middle line:84%
of the Bishop of Winchester, we
had a cross-space correlation

00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:31.280 align:middle line:90%
of 0.6.

00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:34.840 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to take
those numbers, .6 and .347,

00:37:34.840 --> 00:37:36.640 align:middle line:90%
as givens.

00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:40.570 align:middle line:84%
But here's a simple
representation.

00:37:40.570 --> 00:37:42.340 align:middle line:84%
Let's take, again,
only two types

00:37:42.340 --> 00:37:48.460 align:middle line:84%
of land, 1 or 2, only three
events, epsilon equal 1, 2, 3.

00:37:48.460 --> 00:37:53.800 align:middle line:84%
Type 1 land has the highest
return in event 1, then medium,

00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:54.880 align:middle line:90%
then low.

00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:59.140 align:middle line:84%
Type 2 land has
the highest return

00:37:59.140 --> 00:38:03.940 align:middle line:84%
at event 2 surrounded by
the lower numbers, 3 and 2.

00:38:03.940 --> 00:38:09.400 align:middle line:84%
So if you aggregated up the
total yield over all types,

00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:11.500 align:middle line:84%
it would just be the
sum of those columns.

00:38:11.500 --> 00:38:14.690 align:middle line:90%
And it would go 12, 10, 7.

00:38:14.690 --> 00:38:18.680 align:middle line:84%
Now suppose we divided
up the types of land

00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:20.480 align:middle line:90%
in a very extreme way.

00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:24.140 align:middle line:84%
We let household 1
have all of type 1 land

00:38:24.140 --> 00:38:27.170 align:middle line:84%
and household two
all of type 2 land.

00:38:27.170 --> 00:38:29.840 align:middle line:84%
And the question for you
is whether that would be

00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:32.180 align:middle line:90%
an optimal allocation of land.

00:38:32.180 --> 00:38:35.030 align:middle line:84%
If we did it that way
and they were forced

00:38:35.030 --> 00:38:37.220 align:middle line:84%
to eat the grain
off their strips,

00:38:37.220 --> 00:38:39.350 align:middle line:84%
would the consumption
that we see

00:38:39.350 --> 00:38:42.960 align:middle line:84%
correspond to the
implications of the model?

00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:47.090 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is going to be no
because the aggregate is going

00:38:47.090 --> 00:38:50.280 align:middle line:90%
down as epsilon is going up.

00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:52.340 align:middle line:84%
And that's true of
household 1's consumption,

00:38:52.340 --> 00:38:55.130 align:middle line:84%
but it is not true of
household 2's consumption.

00:38:55.130 --> 00:38:59.060 align:middle line:84%
This proposal fails the
monotonicity requirement

00:38:59.060 --> 00:39:02.300 align:middle line:84%
of the theory that as
aggregate consumption

00:39:02.300 --> 00:39:04.430 align:middle line:84%
goes down everybody's
consumption ought

00:39:04.430 --> 00:39:06.950 align:middle line:84%
to go down, although some
people's consumption go

00:39:06.950 --> 00:39:08.940 align:middle line:90%
down more than others.

00:39:08.940 --> 00:39:12.800 align:middle line:84%
So we reject this proposal
for the allocation of land

00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:16.010 align:middle line:84%
if the goal is to achieve an
optimal allocation of risk

00:39:16.010 --> 00:39:19.250 align:middle line:90%
bearing by land division alone.

00:39:19.250 --> 00:39:22.650 align:middle line:84%
Well, there are
other ways to do it.

00:39:22.650 --> 00:39:27.080 align:middle line:84%
Let's take the land type
and give household J

00:39:27.080 --> 00:39:30.500 align:middle line:84%
a proportional number
of shares in the output

00:39:30.500 --> 00:39:32.870 align:middle line:90%
of each type of land.

00:39:32.870 --> 00:39:35.750 align:middle line:84%
So that means
household J would get

00:39:35.750 --> 00:39:39.980 align:middle line:84%
fraction alpha J of the
output over each type of land.

00:39:39.980 --> 00:39:43.050 align:middle line:84%
So we're kind of
re-dividing things here.

00:39:43.050 --> 00:39:45.800 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have
household 1 getting

00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:50.060 align:middle line:84%
some proportion of this column
but also some proportion,

00:39:50.060 --> 00:39:53.630 align:middle line:84%
not necessarily-- yes,
in this case, the same

00:39:53.630 --> 00:39:56.190 align:middle line:90%
of the other type of land.

00:39:56.190 --> 00:39:59.600 align:middle line:84%
So this alpha J
doesn't have a K on it.

00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:01.850 align:middle line:84%
The shares depend
only on the household,

00:40:01.850 --> 00:40:03.740 align:middle line:90%
not on the type of land.

00:40:03.740 --> 00:40:08.350 align:middle line:84%
The shares can depend
on the household.

00:40:08.350 --> 00:40:08.850 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:40:08.850 --> 00:40:12.410 align:middle line:90%
So it's linear in the aggregate.

00:40:12.410 --> 00:40:14.980 align:middle line:84%
If we were over at school,
you'd come up to my office,

00:40:14.980 --> 00:40:16.450 align:middle line:84%
and you'll see my
bookshelf filled

00:40:16.450 --> 00:40:21.130 align:middle line:84%
with stacks of books devoted
to medieval English villages.

00:40:21.130 --> 00:40:24.400 align:middle line:84%
I had a happy time
doing a lot of research.

00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:27.520 align:middle line:84%
And you'd discover
these amazing things.

00:40:27.520 --> 00:40:29.380 align:middle line:84%
Holdings were
scattered over fields

00:40:29.380 --> 00:40:33.010 align:middle line:84%
so that each household
partook in equal proportion

00:40:33.010 --> 00:40:36.130 align:middle line:90%
of fertilizer and poor soils.

00:40:36.130 --> 00:40:37.780 align:middle line:84%
Dividing up the
land in accordance

00:40:37.780 --> 00:40:39.970 align:middle line:84%
with drainage and
exposure, resources

00:40:39.970 --> 00:40:41.920 align:middle line:90%
were divided into shares.

00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:44.170 align:middle line:84%
One man might have more
shares than another,

00:40:44.170 --> 00:40:48.150 align:middle line:84%
but the shares
themselves were equal.

00:40:48.150 --> 00:40:51.090 align:middle line:84%
Now, there are
potential problems.

00:40:51.090 --> 00:40:52.870 align:middle line:84%
For the theory to
fit exactly, we

00:40:52.870 --> 00:40:55.500 align:middle line:84%
got to worry a little
bit about the intercepts

00:40:55.500 --> 00:40:59.580 align:middle line:84%
because those divisions did
not allow the intercepts to be

00:40:59.580 --> 00:41:00.810 align:middle line:90%
other than 0.

00:41:00.810 --> 00:41:05.070 align:middle line:84%
If you go back to where we
first introduced risk sharing

00:41:05.070 --> 00:41:08.310 align:middle line:84%
and looked at particular
utility functions,

00:41:08.310 --> 00:41:11.730 align:middle line:84%
I showed you, as example
of the risk-sharing rules,

00:41:11.730 --> 00:41:14.400 align:middle line:84%
two equations--
constant relative risk

00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:17.460 align:middle line:84%
aversion, constant
absolute risk aversion.

00:41:17.460 --> 00:41:22.200 align:middle line:84%
And the intercept was 0
under these various types

00:41:22.200 --> 00:41:22.960 align:middle line:90%
of conditions.

00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:25.650 align:middle line:84%
So it's not like
they can't be 0,

00:41:25.650 --> 00:41:28.440 align:middle line:84%
but it does require
certain parameters

00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:31.240 align:middle line:84%
to hold in order for
that to be the case.

00:41:31.240 --> 00:41:34.280 align:middle line:84%
So a little bit of
a qualification.

00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:36.870 align:middle line:90%
But all is not lost.

00:41:36.870 --> 00:41:39.210 align:middle line:90%
We can even do more.

00:41:39.210 --> 00:41:43.260 align:middle line:84%
And namely, we don't have to
have a given household having

00:41:43.260 --> 00:41:47.740 align:middle line:84%
the same number of shares
in every type of land.

00:41:47.740 --> 00:41:51.100 align:middle line:84%
And that's going to allow
various kinds of intercepts

00:41:51.100 --> 00:41:53.330 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:41:53.330 --> 00:41:56.470 align:middle line:90%
So here's the idea finally.

00:41:56.470 --> 00:42:00.250 align:middle line:84%
Suppose there are at
least as many land types

00:42:00.250 --> 00:42:04.930 align:middle line:84%
with independent return vectors
as there are states of nature.

00:42:04.930 --> 00:42:07.380 align:middle line:84%
So what I showed you
just now violated that.

00:42:07.380 --> 00:42:11.430 align:middle line:84%
There were three states of
nature and two types of land.

00:42:11.430 --> 00:42:14.480 align:middle line:84%
But if we had three
states of nature,

00:42:14.480 --> 00:42:17.150 align:middle line:84%
we'd have to have
three types of land

00:42:17.150 --> 00:42:18.920 align:middle line:90%
with independent return streams.

00:42:18.920 --> 00:42:22.435 align:middle line:84%
And likewise, s types
of land, we need

00:42:22.435 --> 00:42:26.160 align:middle line:90%
s dimensional return vectors.

00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:30.000 align:middle line:84%
So one column cannot be
derived as a linear combination

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:31.830 align:middle line:90%
of the other columns.

00:42:31.830 --> 00:42:34.530 align:middle line:84%
Now let's solve the
risk-sharing problem

00:42:34.530 --> 00:42:37.830 align:middle line:84%
and take this consumption to
be the target, this consumption

00:42:37.830 --> 00:42:40.230 align:middle line:90%
of household J in state epsilon.

00:42:40.230 --> 00:42:43.320 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to do that,
obviously, over all states

00:42:43.320 --> 00:42:48.090 align:middle line:84%
epsilon and all households
j, their little n of them.

00:42:48.090 --> 00:42:50.760 align:middle line:90%
We get an equation of this form.

00:42:50.760 --> 00:42:52.410 align:middle line:84%
So don't get lost
in the notation.

00:42:52.410 --> 00:42:53.730 align:middle line:90%
I'll help.

00:42:53.730 --> 00:42:57.840 align:middle line:84%
This is consumption of household
J in state 1, consumption

00:42:57.840 --> 00:43:03.830 align:middle line:84%
of household J in state 2,
likewise in state capital S.

00:43:03.830 --> 00:43:05.150 align:middle line:90%
That's a target.

00:43:05.150 --> 00:43:08.310 align:middle line:84%
And just imagine it
solved the Pareto problem.

00:43:08.310 --> 00:43:10.100 align:middle line:90%
How can we achieve it?

00:43:10.100 --> 00:43:14.750 align:middle line:84%
We have as controls the
fraction of type k land held

00:43:14.750 --> 00:43:18.860 align:middle line:84%
by household J. And now
those fractions, alpha j,

00:43:18.860 --> 00:43:20.480 align:middle line:90%
vary with k.

00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:24.590 align:middle line:84%
So we're allowing
land-type-specific allocation

00:43:24.590 --> 00:43:26.090 align:middle line:90%
of shares.

00:43:26.090 --> 00:43:28.400 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, if you do the
linear algebra here,

00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:31.940 align:middle line:84%
here's the yield of
type 1 land in state

00:43:31.940 --> 00:43:36.440 align:middle line:84%
1, the yield of type 2
land in state 1, et cetera.

00:43:36.440 --> 00:43:39.080 align:middle line:84%
These alphas would
then multiply--

00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:43.500 align:middle line:84%
e1, alpha 1, e2,
alpha 2, et cetera.

00:43:43.500 --> 00:43:45.990 align:middle line:84%
So adding it up like
the dot product,

00:43:45.990 --> 00:43:48.320 align:middle line:90%
we would get consumption.

00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:51.470 align:middle line:84%
Consumption is coming from
a share-weighted version

00:43:51.470 --> 00:43:54.560 align:middle line:90%
of the yield.

00:43:54.560 --> 00:43:57.230 align:middle line:90%
Hopefully, the algebra is clear.

00:43:57.230 --> 00:43:59.330 align:middle line:84%
Writing it in matrix
notation, we just

00:43:59.330 --> 00:44:02.150 align:middle line:84%
want to get this
quote endowment matrix

00:44:02.150 --> 00:44:07.680 align:middle line:84%
e times the share vector for
household J varying over type k

00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:08.180 align:middle line:90%
land.

00:44:08.180 --> 00:44:12.530 align:middle line:84%
It's a vector equal to the
state-dependent consumptions.

00:44:12.530 --> 00:44:16.220 align:middle line:90%
So e times alpha equals cj.

00:44:16.220 --> 00:44:19.010 align:middle line:84%
So then the question is,
to achieve this target,

00:44:19.010 --> 00:44:20.690 align:middle line:90%
can we find alphas that do it?

00:44:20.690 --> 00:44:22.620 align:middle line:84%
And that's like
solving this equation.

00:44:22.620 --> 00:44:26.590 align:middle line:84%
So essentially, take an
inverse of something.

00:44:26.590 --> 00:44:31.030 align:middle line:84%
If there are as many return
vectors over types of land

00:44:31.030 --> 00:44:34.300 align:middle line:84%
that are independent of each
other as there are states,

00:44:34.300 --> 00:44:37.720 align:middle line:90%
then this matrix has an inverse.

00:44:37.720 --> 00:44:41.990 align:middle line:84%
It's non-singular, so you
can solve this equation.

00:44:41.990 --> 00:44:45.130 align:middle line:84%
So now we'll have
solutions for the alphas.

00:44:45.130 --> 00:44:48.220 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out if you do
that not just for household j

00:44:48.220 --> 00:44:51.610 align:middle line:84%
but over all of them,
you'll get an implication

00:44:51.610 --> 00:44:56.550 align:middle line:84%
that the sum of the
alphas will add up to 1.

00:44:56.550 --> 00:44:58.680 align:middle line:90%
So they do look like shares.

00:44:58.680 --> 00:45:04.920 align:middle line:84%
Type k land held in fraction
alpha j by the j-th household

00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:08.160 align:middle line:84%
when summed over-- there
should be a sum here--

00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:09.720 align:middle line:90%
there was one there--

00:45:09.720 --> 00:45:11.940 align:middle line:84%
when summed over
j would equal 1.

00:45:11.940 --> 00:45:14.490 align:middle line:90%
So all the land is divided.

00:45:14.490 --> 00:45:17.130 align:middle line:84%
All the land of each
type k is totally divided

00:45:17.130 --> 00:45:19.680 align:middle line:90%
among all the households.

00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:21.780 align:middle line:84%
You could run into a
little bit of problem

00:45:21.780 --> 00:45:24.480 align:middle line:84%
if the alphas went
negative because then

00:45:24.480 --> 00:45:26.500 align:middle line:90%
that's like trying to go short.

00:45:26.500 --> 00:45:29.470 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to
allow that to happen.

00:45:29.470 --> 00:45:31.980 align:middle line:84%
So there's a little bit
of a fly in the ointment.

00:45:31.980 --> 00:45:33.630 align:middle line:84%
But roughly speaking,
there's a way

00:45:33.630 --> 00:45:39.070 align:middle line:84%
to achieve an optimal allocation
of risk sharing just by shares.

00:45:39.070 --> 00:45:43.320 align:middle line:84%
So they don't need to
transfer risk around ex post.

00:45:43.320 --> 00:45:45.990 align:middle line:90%
They can do it all ex ante.

00:45:45.990 --> 00:45:48.180 align:middle line:84%
Now, in order to
achieve that, we

00:45:48.180 --> 00:45:50.280 align:middle line:84%
had to ignore the
negative alphas.

00:45:50.280 --> 00:45:52.620 align:middle line:84%
But more to the point,
we had to assume

00:45:52.620 --> 00:45:54.780 align:middle line:84%
there are as many
types of land as there

00:45:54.780 --> 00:45:56.580 align:middle line:90%
are states of the world.

00:45:56.580 --> 00:45:57.808 align:middle line:90%
Maybe that's not true.

00:45:57.808 --> 00:45:58.350 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:45:58.350 --> 00:45:59.910 align:middle line:90%
It could go both ways.

00:45:59.910 --> 00:46:02.190 align:middle line:84%
How many different
types of land are there,

00:46:02.190 --> 00:46:05.760 align:middle line:84%
and how many different states
can a given land type take on?

00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:08.490 align:middle line:84%
If there's incredible
heterogeneity over land,

00:46:08.490 --> 00:46:10.680 align:middle line:84%
it's entirely possible
that the number of types

00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:14.370 align:middle line:84%
was equal if not greater
than the number of states.

00:46:14.370 --> 00:46:17.040 align:middle line:84%
But I could also imagine
the other way around.

00:46:17.040 --> 00:46:19.740 align:middle line:84%
Like the Thai village, you've
got low land and high land.

00:46:19.740 --> 00:46:21.810 align:middle line:84%
You put them in two
categories, and then you

00:46:21.810 --> 00:46:22.860 align:middle line:90%
have multiple states.

00:46:22.860 --> 00:46:25.980 align:middle line:84%
You'd have an
incomplete version.

00:46:25.980 --> 00:46:27.660 align:middle line:90%
Let's see how bad it is, though.

00:46:27.660 --> 00:46:31.530 align:middle line:84%
Maybe as an approximation,
they were doing pretty well

00:46:31.530 --> 00:46:33.360 align:middle line:84%
by dividing up the
land even if they

00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:37.930 align:middle line:84%
couldn't achieve the optimal
allocation perfectly.

00:46:37.930 --> 00:46:41.680 align:middle line:84%
So let's put in two
different utility functions.

00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:44.950 align:middle line:84%
For household 1, we have
constant relative risk

00:46:44.950 --> 00:46:49.240 align:middle line:84%
aversion, and for household
2, it's a quadratic function.

00:46:49.240 --> 00:46:53.170 align:middle line:84%
This quadratic thing is
a pain and always scary

00:46:53.170 --> 00:46:53.960 align:middle line:90%
when you see it.

00:46:53.960 --> 00:46:55.660 align:middle line:90%
It's like there's a bliss point.

00:46:55.660 --> 00:46:56.740 align:middle line:90%
We've talked about this.

00:46:56.740 --> 00:46:59.200 align:middle line:84%
Consumption is less
than the bliss point

00:46:59.200 --> 00:47:02.500 align:middle line:84%
assumed so that the marginal
utility of consumption

00:47:02.500 --> 00:47:04.398 align:middle line:90%
is always positive.

00:47:04.398 --> 00:47:06.190 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, you see a
lot of negative signs,

00:47:06.190 --> 00:47:07.930 align:middle line:90%
and it's kind of disturbing.

00:47:07.930 --> 00:47:10.870 align:middle line:84%
Can this consumption be
higher than the bliss point?

00:47:10.870 --> 00:47:14.860 align:middle line:84%
No, because you'll get marginal
utility being negative,

00:47:14.860 --> 00:47:16.760 align:middle line:84%
moving negatively
with consumption.

00:47:16.760 --> 00:47:20.110 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, just so you feel
a bit more comfortable,

00:47:20.110 --> 00:47:24.100 align:middle line:84%
let's put in alpha equal
to 0.5, k equal 0.002,

00:47:24.100 --> 00:47:27.040 align:middle line:90%
and be equal to 80.

00:47:27.040 --> 00:47:30.010 align:middle line:84%
So we have completely
parameterized this family

00:47:30.010 --> 00:47:31.270 align:middle line:90%
of utility functions.

00:47:31.270 --> 00:47:33.910 align:middle line:84%
And again, we have
different preferences here

00:47:33.910 --> 00:47:37.250 align:middle line:84%
but nice concave utility,
strictly, for both.

00:47:37.250 --> 00:47:40.870 align:middle line:84%
We've got two types of land,
and we're back to, say,

00:47:40.870 --> 00:47:43.880 align:middle line:84%
having three or more
states of the world.

00:47:43.880 --> 00:47:48.580 align:middle line:84%
So ex ante division into
shares cannot work perfectly.

00:47:48.580 --> 00:47:51.760 align:middle line:84%
To see how far we get, we
constrain the programming

00:47:51.760 --> 00:47:57.730 align:middle line:84%
problem to nevertheless
search over these shares,

00:47:57.730 --> 00:48:02.230 align:middle line:84%
alpha jk of household
J share of type k land.

00:48:02.230 --> 00:48:05.290 align:middle line:84%
And we maximize a
lambda-weighted sum

00:48:05.290 --> 00:48:07.870 align:middle line:90%
of ex ante expected utilities.

00:48:07.870 --> 00:48:13.390 align:middle line:84%
Oh, well there's only one date
here, so ignore the dynamics.

00:48:13.390 --> 00:48:15.640 align:middle line:90%
But there are multiple states.

00:48:15.640 --> 00:48:17.800 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to max this
thing subject to shares

00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:20.740 align:middle line:84%
can't go negative, and
they have to add up to 1.

00:48:20.740 --> 00:48:23.770 align:middle line:84%
So it's a constrained
programming problem.

00:48:23.770 --> 00:48:27.040 align:middle line:84%
We could call the solution
to this constrained optimal.

00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:30.280 align:middle line:84%
It's constrained by the
premise that the mechanism only

00:48:30.280 --> 00:48:32.980 align:middle line:84%
allows ex-ante
division into shares

00:48:32.980 --> 00:48:38.570 align:middle line:84%
and not ex-post consumption
transfers, not gifts, not

00:48:38.570 --> 00:48:40.970 align:middle line:90%
borrowing and lending, nothing.

00:48:40.970 --> 00:48:43.790 align:middle line:84%
Now, you know from
our work on Pareto

00:48:43.790 --> 00:48:47.720 align:middle line:84%
optimal allocations there's
going to be a Pareto frontier.

00:48:47.720 --> 00:48:50.390 align:middle line:84%
So it's not like
there's one solution.

00:48:50.390 --> 00:48:53.510 align:middle line:84%
It's going to vary
with the lambdas.

00:48:53.510 --> 00:48:56.930 align:middle line:84%
So we'll do something
special as an example, which

00:48:56.930 --> 00:49:00.050 align:middle line:84%
is to maximize the
utility of household 1

00:49:00.050 --> 00:49:02.360 align:middle line:84%
subject to the
utility of household

00:49:02.360 --> 00:49:05.730 align:middle line:90%
2 at an arbitrary constant.

00:49:05.730 --> 00:49:10.160 align:middle line:84%
So let me show you a picture,
and then I'll go back.

00:49:10.160 --> 00:49:12.710 align:middle line:84%
We're in utility space,
so we have the utilities

00:49:12.710 --> 00:49:15.050 align:middle line:90%
of household 1 and household 2.

00:49:15.050 --> 00:49:18.470 align:middle line:84%
And we have-- if we didn't
have a constrained problem,

00:49:18.470 --> 00:49:21.200 align:middle line:84%
we'd have this outer
frontier of the set

00:49:21.200 --> 00:49:24.300 align:middle line:84%
of all possible utilities
on the boundary.

00:49:24.300 --> 00:49:28.160 align:middle line:84%
And we'll call that the utility
at the full risk sharing.

00:49:28.160 --> 00:49:30.080 align:middle line:90%
There are many solutions.

00:49:30.080 --> 00:49:33.710 align:middle line:84%
We got these through
hyperplanes previously.

00:49:33.710 --> 00:49:36.810 align:middle line:84%
There is an equivalent
way to do it,

00:49:36.810 --> 00:49:40.910 align:middle line:84%
which is to fix the utility
of one household, namely 2,

00:49:40.910 --> 00:49:43.920 align:middle line:84%
and maximize the utility
of the other one.

00:49:43.920 --> 00:49:46.070 align:middle line:90%
So we would end up right here.

00:49:46.070 --> 00:49:48.260 align:middle line:84%
But in the constrained
problem, we're

00:49:48.260 --> 00:49:51.290 align:middle line:84%
limited to dividing
up land by shares.

00:49:51.290 --> 00:49:55.850 align:middle line:84%
That constrained Pareto
frontier is interior, still

00:49:55.850 --> 00:49:57.770 align:middle line:90%
a bit concave.

00:49:57.770 --> 00:50:00.140 align:middle line:84%
And we would move,
therefore, from where

00:50:00.140 --> 00:50:02.600 align:middle line:84%
that horizontal utility
level for household 2

00:50:02.600 --> 00:50:05.700 align:middle line:84%
hits the outer frontier
versus the inner frontier.

00:50:05.700 --> 00:50:07.430 align:middle line:84%
So let's focus on
the inner frontier,

00:50:07.430 --> 00:50:09.530 align:middle line:84%
the constrained
problem, and then see

00:50:09.530 --> 00:50:13.120 align:middle line:84%
how close they're going to
get to the outer frontier.

00:50:13.120 --> 00:50:15.010 align:middle line:90%
I solved that thing numerically.

00:50:15.010 --> 00:50:17.740 align:middle line:84%
I was trying to give you all
the parameters for utility

00:50:17.740 --> 00:50:18.910 align:middle line:90%
functions.

00:50:18.910 --> 00:50:21.970 align:middle line:84%
Some of it's missing
here-- covariance,

00:50:21.970 --> 00:50:23.950 align:middle line:90%
coefficient of variation.

00:50:23.950 --> 00:50:29.470 align:middle line:84%
And you get a solution that
household 1 has about 3/4,

00:50:29.470 --> 00:50:35.530 align:middle line:84%
72%, of land type I 2 and
about a quarter of land type 2.

00:50:35.530 --> 00:50:37.690 align:middle line:84%
And household 2 would
be on the other side

00:50:37.690 --> 00:50:41.420 align:middle line:90%
of this at roughly 1/4, 3/4.

00:50:41.420 --> 00:50:44.830 align:middle line:84%
So one thing to
note is that that

00:50:44.830 --> 00:50:51.040 align:middle line:84%
generates a non-linear sharing
rule but non-optimal rule.

00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:52.970 align:middle line:90%
I think I missed--

00:50:52.970 --> 00:50:54.980 align:middle line:84%
when I presented this
constraint problem,

00:50:54.980 --> 00:50:58.850 align:middle line:84%
I neglected the little
paragraph at the bottom.

00:50:58.850 --> 00:51:01.150 align:middle line:90%
No, it's not there.

00:51:01.150 --> 00:51:03.910 align:middle line:90%
Well, let me remind you.

00:51:03.910 --> 00:51:07.300 align:middle line:84%
Again, back to the preference
lecture where we did risk,

00:51:07.300 --> 00:51:11.260 align:middle line:84%
and I showed you two
particular utility functions,

00:51:11.260 --> 00:51:15.490 align:middle line:84%
constant exponential and
constant relative risk aversion

00:51:15.490 --> 00:51:16.930 align:middle line:90%
with linear schedules.

00:51:16.930 --> 00:51:21.160 align:middle line:84%
But then I showed you another
figure which was non-linear--

00:51:21.160 --> 00:51:24.700 align:middle line:84%
monotone increasing for both
households, but nonlinear.

00:51:24.700 --> 00:51:29.020 align:middle line:84%
That came from this
specification of utilities.

00:51:29.020 --> 00:51:32.020 align:middle line:84%
So that's what I was looking
for, seen in previous lecture

00:51:32.020 --> 00:51:33.130 align:middle line:90%
7.

00:51:33.130 --> 00:51:37.990 align:middle line:84%
So we know the optimal
sharing rules are nonlinear.

00:51:37.990 --> 00:51:41.590 align:middle line:84%
Dividing up into shares
suggests we're going

00:51:41.590 --> 00:51:44.300 align:middle line:90%
to end up with linear rules.

00:51:44.300 --> 00:51:47.050 align:middle line:84%
So we're not going to
end up with the optimum.

00:51:47.050 --> 00:51:49.150 align:middle line:84%
But we can still
try to figure out

00:51:49.150 --> 00:51:54.320 align:middle line:84%
how close the inner frontier
is to the outer frontier.

00:51:54.320 --> 00:51:57.560 align:middle line:90%
So let's look at the transfers.

00:51:57.560 --> 00:51:59.330 align:middle line:90%
Let me state this clearly.

00:51:59.330 --> 00:52:03.860 align:middle line:84%
We're going to try to do it
ex-ante by division of shares,

00:52:03.860 --> 00:52:07.520 align:middle line:84%
get the constrained
optimum, and then look

00:52:07.520 --> 00:52:11.570 align:middle line:84%
at transfers across the
two households, who's

00:52:11.570 --> 00:52:14.300 align:middle line:84%
paying who depending
on the state, and then

00:52:14.300 --> 00:52:17.270 align:middle line:84%
finally, how those transfers
would need potentially

00:52:17.270 --> 00:52:20.760 align:middle line:90%
to be augmented.

00:52:20.760 --> 00:52:22.350 align:middle line:84%
So here's the
aggregate endowment.

00:52:22.350 --> 00:52:26.300 align:middle line:84%
This is the sum of the yields
over the two types of land.

00:52:26.300 --> 00:52:28.220 align:middle line:84%
That's also
aggregate consumption

00:52:28.220 --> 00:52:30.650 align:middle line:84%
because this is
a static problem.

00:52:30.650 --> 00:52:33.830 align:middle line:84%
Here is consumption of
the individual agents,

00:52:33.830 --> 00:52:35.300 align:middle line:90%
both of them.

00:52:35.300 --> 00:52:39.830 align:middle line:84%
This is the consumption
of person 1, constrained,

00:52:39.830 --> 00:52:42.350 align:middle line:90%
linear dotted line.

00:52:42.350 --> 00:52:44.960 align:middle line:84%
Here's the consumption
of person 2.

00:52:44.960 --> 00:52:49.250 align:middle line:84%
Constrained is this dot
dashed line for person 2.

00:52:49.250 --> 00:52:53.090 align:middle line:84%
Constrained is the
dot-dot-dot line for person 1.

00:52:53.090 --> 00:52:55.160 align:middle line:90%
They're both linear schedules.

00:52:55.160 --> 00:52:57.800 align:middle line:84%
Now, remember, they're not
doing this with transfers--

00:52:57.800 --> 00:52:59.360 align:middle line:84%
I kind of misspoke
a minute ago--

00:52:59.360 --> 00:53:02.390 align:middle line:84%
because they're doing it with
ex-ante division into shares.

00:53:02.390 --> 00:53:05.210 align:middle line:84%
But nevertheless, it's not
the full-blown optimum.

00:53:05.210 --> 00:53:08.540 align:middle line:84%
It's not the outer frontier
in which you can not only

00:53:08.540 --> 00:53:11.750 align:middle line:84%
have division but
also ex-post transfers

00:53:11.750 --> 00:53:13.130 align:middle line:90%
to get to the full optimum.

00:53:13.130 --> 00:53:16.310 align:middle line:84%
And those schedules are
listed here as unconstrained.

00:53:16.310 --> 00:53:20.160 align:middle line:84%
And they are non-linear, as
I was trying to say earlier.

00:53:20.160 --> 00:53:25.520 align:middle line:84%
So if we look at these
states, say five states,

00:53:25.520 --> 00:53:28.880 align:middle line:84%
and look at consumption under
ex-ante division of land

00:53:28.880 --> 00:53:33.680 align:middle line:84%
versus consumption under the
full optimum, for household 1,

00:53:33.680 --> 00:53:36.980 align:middle line:84%
you can see household
1 is monotonic.

00:53:36.980 --> 00:53:39.020 align:middle line:84%
Household consumption
is logically

00:53:39.020 --> 00:53:41.420 align:middle line:84%
increasing with the
aggregate, but it's

00:53:41.420 --> 00:53:43.430 align:middle line:84%
a bit different,
although monotonic,

00:53:43.430 --> 00:53:45.380 align:middle line:84%
from what it would be
under the full optimum.

00:53:45.380 --> 00:53:48.560 align:middle line:84%
And here you can see
at the lowest state,

00:53:48.560 --> 00:53:52.190 align:middle line:84%
household 1 would be consuming
more under the full optimum

00:53:52.190 --> 00:53:56.120 align:middle line:84%
but then less under the
full optimum relative

00:53:56.120 --> 00:54:00.500 align:middle line:84%
to the division, less, and
then back to being more.

00:54:00.500 --> 00:54:02.640 align:middle line:90%
So here it is over here.

00:54:02.640 --> 00:54:04.680 align:middle line:90%
Why am I struggling so hard?

00:54:04.680 --> 00:54:07.610 align:middle line:84%
So this is the amount
of the transfer

00:54:07.610 --> 00:54:11.480 align:middle line:84%
from household 2
to household 1 that

00:54:11.480 --> 00:54:15.860 align:middle line:84%
is necessary to add
on to the solution

00:54:15.860 --> 00:54:19.900 align:middle line:84%
from the ex-ante division
of land shares only.

00:54:19.900 --> 00:54:22.640 align:middle line:84%
If you wanted to look
at it in a picture,

00:54:22.640 --> 00:54:27.400 align:middle line:84%
the picture is
literally the difference

00:54:27.400 --> 00:54:29.780 align:middle line:90%
between these two lines.

00:54:29.780 --> 00:54:32.560 align:middle line:84%
So here, the amount
that household 1

00:54:32.560 --> 00:54:37.840 align:middle line:84%
ought to be getting under the
full optimum would be higher,

00:54:37.840 --> 00:54:40.990 align:middle line:84%
and therefore, ought to
get a positive transfer.

00:54:40.990 --> 00:54:44.570 align:middle line:84%
Here, it would be lower,
hence the negative transfer.

00:54:44.570 --> 00:54:47.620 align:middle line:84%
And finally, at the
end, positive again.

00:54:47.620 --> 00:54:50.170 align:middle line:84%
So that's consistent
with these numbers

00:54:50.170 --> 00:54:53.260 align:middle line:84%
where these states,
going from 1 to 5,

00:54:53.260 --> 00:54:55.660 align:middle line:84%
is like moving across
the different values

00:54:55.660 --> 00:54:57.550 align:middle line:90%
of the aggregate endowment.

00:54:57.550 --> 00:55:01.330 align:middle line:84%
So in summary, I guess
there is a couple

00:55:01.330 --> 00:55:04.450 align:middle line:84%
of takeaways from the
second half of this lecture.

00:55:04.450 --> 00:55:07.960 align:middle line:84%
One, we looked at special
mechanisms-- in this case,

00:55:07.960 --> 00:55:11.410 align:middle line:84%
ex-ante division of land
and whether or not we

00:55:11.410 --> 00:55:13.300 align:middle line:84%
could get to an
optimal allocation

00:55:13.300 --> 00:55:15.430 align:middle line:90%
of risk bearing that way.

00:55:15.430 --> 00:55:18.960 align:middle line:84%
And we saw some special
cases where could.

00:55:18.960 --> 00:55:22.210 align:middle line:84%
We had to make the shares
different across the different

00:55:22.210 --> 00:55:25.390 align:middle line:84%
households and maybe different
across the different land

00:55:25.390 --> 00:55:28.990 align:middle line:84%
types, especially so if we
accommodated more and more

00:55:28.990 --> 00:55:30.920 align:middle line:90%
diversity and preferences.

00:55:30.920 --> 00:55:33.670 align:middle line:84%
The second takeaway
from the second part

00:55:33.670 --> 00:55:37.330 align:middle line:84%
is we might not
achieve a full optimum,

00:55:37.330 --> 00:55:39.940 align:middle line:84%
so we would have expected some
kind of borrowing and lending

00:55:39.940 --> 00:55:42.310 align:middle line:84%
and gift-giving in that
medieval village economy

00:55:42.310 --> 00:55:46.390 align:middle line:84%
even if we can't find it
in the historical records.

00:55:46.390 --> 00:55:49.990 align:middle line:84%
Or we could just say, evidently,
for institutional reasons

00:55:49.990 --> 00:55:52.780 align:middle line:84%
we don't understand, they
just weren't doing it.

00:55:52.780 --> 00:55:54.560 align:middle line:90%
But we don't lose our tools.

00:55:54.560 --> 00:55:55.660 align:middle line:90%
Not all is lost.

00:55:55.660 --> 00:56:00.040 align:middle line:84%
We are still able to solve for
a constrained optimal allocation

00:56:00.040 --> 00:56:03.220 align:middle line:84%
solving the so-called Pareto
problem or programming

00:56:03.220 --> 00:56:06.890 align:middle line:84%
problem, maximizing
lambda-weighted sums of utility

00:56:06.890 --> 00:56:10.690 align:middle line:84%
subject to constraints with the
appropriate control variables,

00:56:10.690 --> 00:56:12.860 align:middle line:90%
in this case shares.

00:56:12.860 --> 00:56:14.530 align:middle line:84%
And then the big
picture of this lecture

00:56:14.530 --> 00:56:17.260 align:middle line:84%
is we're looking
at the application

00:56:17.260 --> 00:56:20.770 align:middle line:84%
of the theory of the optimal
allocation of risk bearing.

00:56:20.770 --> 00:56:22.900 align:middle line:84%
We did that in
villages in India,

00:56:22.900 --> 00:56:25.100 align:middle line:84%
looking at consumption
and income data.

00:56:25.100 --> 00:56:27.940 align:middle line:84%
So from a science point
of view, we have a model.

00:56:27.940 --> 00:56:28.840 align:middle line:90%
We have data.

00:56:28.840 --> 00:56:31.390 align:middle line:84%
The data can vary
across the applications.

00:56:31.390 --> 00:56:33.100 align:middle line:84%
You can still ask,
even if we don't

00:56:33.100 --> 00:56:35.440 align:middle line:84%
have the data on
everything, whether we can

00:56:35.440 --> 00:56:37.270 align:middle line:90%
see how well the theory fits.

00:56:37.270 --> 00:56:39.610 align:middle line:90%
And we could do that in--

00:56:39.610 --> 00:56:41.500 align:middle line:84%
in the medieval
villages, we don't even

00:56:41.500 --> 00:56:44.260 align:middle line:84%
have data on consumption
of individual households,

00:56:44.260 --> 00:56:46.060 align:middle line:84%
and all we see are
pictures of land.

00:56:46.060 --> 00:56:49.510 align:middle line:84%
But we do have the covariance
and variance statistics.

00:56:49.510 --> 00:56:51.250 align:middle line:84%
So we're kind of
able to calibrate

00:56:51.250 --> 00:56:54.730 align:middle line:84%
the model a bit the way we were
calibrating the dynamic storage

00:56:54.730 --> 00:56:56.890 align:middle line:84%
model, but in this
case, not to try

00:56:56.890 --> 00:57:00.130 align:middle line:84%
to explain why they didn't
store very often, but rather,

00:57:00.130 --> 00:57:03.730 align:middle line:84%
to explain this very salient
pattern of dividing land

00:57:03.730 --> 00:57:05.320 align:middle line:90%
into different strips.

00:57:05.320 --> 00:57:05.830 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:57:05.830 --> 00:57:08.860 align:middle line:90%
So that's all I have for today.

00:57:08.860 --> 00:57:10.410 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:57:10.410 --> 00:57:11.470 align:middle line:90%
See you soon.

00:57:11.470 --> 00:57:13.430 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:57:13.430 --> 00:57:21.000 align:middle line:90%

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:24.250
WILL MA: OK, guys, I
guess I'll get started.

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:26.190
So I guess one
quick announcement

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:31.259
is, so I guess everyone has
taken a look at the prizes.

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:32.759
If you can take a
look at the prizes

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.980
and, especially, if
you're near the top

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.900
and expect yourself to
be getting some prizes.

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.090
So we haven't announced
the final ordering yet,

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.980
because it'll also
depend on the homework

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.580
and then we'll decide how much.

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:45.211
It'll mostly just
be number of points,

00:00:45.211 --> 00:00:46.710
but we might give
a bit of weighting

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.400
to people who have like a high
points per game or something.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.040
But if you think you have
a decent chance of getting

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.920
prizes, it'd be good
if you looked them

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.680
over for when you research who
this Mike McDonald guy is, how

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.030
much is his coaching worth--

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.940
you can do that beforehand so
that people don't take forever

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.550
deciding which prize
you want on Friday.

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:08.966
OK, so I'm going to
get started then.

00:01:08.966 --> 00:01:11.340
So this is going to be the
last class I'm going to teach.

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.030
So the final class,
on Friday, is

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.480
going to be guess-lectured
by Bill Chen.

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:22.420
So I want to go through an
in-depth combinatorial hand

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.390
analysis of a cash-game hand--

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.872
go very in depth on a hand
where you have deep stacks,

00:01:27.872 --> 00:01:30.330
and there's a lot of action,
and there's a lot of deduction

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:31.830
that can take place.

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:36.000
And then I'll finish with
some general poker stuff

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.420
and answer any questions you
guys might have about the poker

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.710
economy, how certain things
work, the history of poker--

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.830
I'm happy to answer
whatever questions.

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:48.270
OK, so first, I'll do something
more technical and more

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.500
practical to the game.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.950
So an in-depth combinatorial
hand analysis in cash games.

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.810
So I'm going to look
at the following hand.

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.580
And the board is visible?

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:57.240
It's good?

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.760
OK.

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:59.760
So this is a cash game.

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.218
This is no longer
a tournament now.

00:02:01.218 --> 00:02:03.690
And everybody has
100 big blinds.

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:07.630
So the blinds are $1 and $2,
and everyone starts with $200.

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.509
So it's 100 big blinds.

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.000
The cutoff opens near six,
and we have eight-seven

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.410
suited on the button.

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.690
And when it's this
deep stacked--

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.130
so in a tournament,
this might not

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.860
be a good situation to
call, because it just puts

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.580
a lot of risk on you to bust.

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.210
And also, you're not
really that deep stacked.

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.280
But here, with
100 big blinds, we

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.400
can really realize a
lot of our implied odds

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.047
given that we're
both in position,

00:02:31.047 --> 00:02:32.755
and we have a hand
that plays very well--

00:02:32.755 --> 00:02:35.730
a suited connector-- that can
make straights and flushes.

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.100
So we decide to call, and
the big blind also calls.

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.660
OK, so the flop is 10,
eight, six with a club,

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.850
and the cutoff
continuation bet's 14.

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:50.940
So one thing I'll
talk about first

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.520
is, continuation bet sizing.

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.100
So I said a bit
about this, but I

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.900
wanted to talk a bit
more about bet sizing.

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.942
And this is really just
a review of what I've

00:02:59.942 --> 00:03:01.150
been talking about all class.

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.770
It's the same principles when
deciding your flop and turn bet

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:05.460
sizing.

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:07.890
So you don't want to bet so
small that your opponent has

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.110
the odds to call with
anything, but you

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.720
don't want to bet so big that
you are risking a lot of chips

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:13.890
when you're bluffing.

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.420
And also, if your raise size
commits your entire stack

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:21.960
anyway, like if you're roughly,
let's say, betting 40% or more

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:24.540
of your remaining chips, then
you might as well go all-in

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.940
if it's the flop or the
turn because you probably

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.782
aren't going to fold.

00:03:28.782 --> 00:03:30.240
Given that your
hand is good enough

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.040
to put in 40% of your
chips, you probably

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.110
have enough equity
that you're OK

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:37.494
putting in 100% of your chips.

00:03:37.494 --> 00:03:39.660
Remember that raising your
bet gives them the option

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.460
to reraise, so that's
always an incentive

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:44.580
against raising a flop bet.

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:46.400
The sizing should be
bigger on dry boards

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:47.730
and smaller on dry boards.

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:48.840
We talked about this.

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:49.420
And you want to bet?

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.336
Bet a bit bigger when
they're out of position.

00:03:51.336 --> 00:03:53.790
So he's kind of out of
position here against us,

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.670
and he bets 14 into 19, which
is a reasonably big bet,

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:57.960
but I think it's fine.

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:00.390
So with our hand here,
eight-seven of clubs,

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:02.940
I think we definitely
don't want to be folding.

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:04.860
So let's talk about
the differences

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:07.410
between raising and calling.

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:12.910
So we decide to call, and
so what's the analysis?

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:15.250
So we're definitely not folding.

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:16.860
Raising, I think,
is a bit suicidal

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:20.010
when we have a medium-strength
hand that can play well

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:21.810
in position on a lot of turns.

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:24.030
And we have a
backdoor flush draw;

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:25.980
and our straight
draw's very legitimate

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:27.960
when there is no
flush draw out there.

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.080
So we decide to just call.

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.700
We have to be a bit worried
about a big blind check-raise,

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:34.410
but I think it's OK.

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:36.780
It's not that big of a deal,
especially when there's

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:37.930
no flush draw.

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:41.100
So the big blind folds.

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:46.880
And on the turn is the queen
of clubs, and he bets 30.

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:50.850
OK, so this is sort of a tougher
decision now than the flop,

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:51.840
I'd say.

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:53.850
So let's analyze this.

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:58.000
So he bets 30 into 47,
we've got 180 behind,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.730
which is about
four times the pot,

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:02.509
and we've got a pretty
bad hand right now,

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:04.050
but we still have
a pair, and we have

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:06.570
lots of chances to hit a
straight, or hit a flush,

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:08.980
or hit three of a
kind or hit two pairs.

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:12.379
So tons of outs-- tons of
river cards that help us.

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:13.920
And so what are the
benefits of each?

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:16.770
OK, so I think it's
fairly clear we're

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:19.330
not going to fold here
with this much equity.

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.534
So what are the
benefits of calling?

00:05:22.534 --> 00:05:24.450
Well, we get to see the
river for sure, right?

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:27.300
If the river's a
club, then we don't

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:29.557
want to fold in
situations and not

00:05:29.557 --> 00:05:31.890
see the river when it could
be a club, which is the best

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:34.364
card for us, essentially.

00:05:34.364 --> 00:05:36.030
Yeah, so we really
want to see the river

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:39.960
because if we raise, then maybe
they could reraise all-in,

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.910
and then we would have to fold.

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:44.210
So that's one clear benefit.

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:46.730
And another sort of
benefit is, we already

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:48.120
have a pair to start with.

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:50.637
So we don't really need
to bluff to win a hand.

00:05:50.637 --> 00:05:52.970
So this is something I've
been talking about a lot, too.

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:58.950
If you don't need to raise
to win the hand because you

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:01.020
already have a
pair, then there's

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:02.579
a lot more incentive to call.

00:06:02.579 --> 00:06:04.120
So what are some
benefits of raising?

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:07.130
Well, if you get him to fold
something like pocket jacks--

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:09.060
if we think he might
have like pocket jacks--

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:12.570
it can definitely get him
to fold some better hands.

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:15.510
And we can bet the river and
win a bigger pot when we hit.

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:18.630
And we can also maybe make some
bigger bluffs when we miss.

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:22.140
So we'll go through a more
detailed analysis in a bit,

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:25.560
but I like calling
in this situation.

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:27.960
I think with a draw
that has no showdown

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:31.500
value, like say I had nine-five
of clubs instead of eight-seven

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:33.350
of clubs, which
has a pair, I think

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:35.970
I would raise for two reasons.

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:40.110
One is, I would need to
bluff the river anyway

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:41.200
if I miss the river.

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:43.710
So if I raise now, I
just give myself a chance

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:45.300
to win the pot right now.

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:49.680
And another benefit of
raising is that I can--

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:52.320
I'm not that unhappy
if he goes all-in

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:58.110
because my jaw is less strong
than eight-seven of clubs is.

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:00.604
OK, and then maybe with a
hand like ace-jack of clubs,

00:07:00.604 --> 00:07:02.520
I would raise just because
we can maybe get it

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:05.568
in against weaker flush draws.

00:07:05.568 --> 00:07:08.520
OK, so yeah, this is
a general principle

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:11.550
that I haven't really talked
about for playing on flops

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:14.280
and turns.

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:16.126
And this sort of
goes along with most

00:07:16.126 --> 00:07:18.000
of the stuff we've talked
about in this class

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.180
but, in general, when you
have like the stone-cold nuts

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:24.364
and when you have
weaker draws, you

00:07:24.364 --> 00:07:27.030
want to be the one-- you want to
be betting and raising in a way

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:30.286
such that your opponent
gets the last bet in.

00:07:30.286 --> 00:07:33.750
So one person is always going
to go all-in first, right?

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:36.420
If you're raising each other
or betting and raising,

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:38.400
one person is going
to go on first,

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:39.930
and the other person,
basically, has

00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:43.200
to decide whether to call or
fold and play for your stack.

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:45.690
So if you have the
stone-cold nuts,

00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:49.801
then you want to be the person
having your opponent go all-in

00:07:49.801 --> 00:07:50.300
first.

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:51.900
Because obviously, you
have a very easy decision.

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:53.570
You just call and
you're going to win.

00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:56.250
On the other hand, if you
have like a weaker draw,

00:07:56.250 --> 00:07:57.961
which is, essentially,
your bluff--

00:07:57.961 --> 00:07:59.460
because we don't
want to be bluffing

00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:00.510
with absolutely nothing.

00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:01.926
We want to be
bluffing, basically,

00:08:01.926 --> 00:08:03.480
with our weaker draws.

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:05.740
That's also an easy decision
because if, let's say,

00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:07.410
we have a gutshot straight draw.

00:08:07.410 --> 00:08:09.420
So we have four outs only.

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:11.664
We're not that sad if
our opponent goes all-in

00:08:11.664 --> 00:08:13.080
on the flop or
all-in on the turn.

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:14.070
We just fold.

00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:17.640
We have an easy
decision; whereas if we

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:19.615
have a more vulnerable
good hand-- like you

00:08:19.615 --> 00:08:22.780
have top pair with a
medium kicker, then

00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:23.890
it's a tough decision.

00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:29.430
If our opponent goes all-in,
we have a tough decision.

00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:30.590
We're not sure what to do.

00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:32.419
And same if we have a
stronger draw-- like

00:08:32.419 --> 00:08:35.010
say we have a flush draw,
and we have nine outs,

00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:36.990
and then our opponent
goes all-in on the flop,

00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:40.500
and we have like 1.61
odds to call or something.

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:42.270
It's a difficult decision.

00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:45.052
And so in these
hands, you definitely

00:08:45.052 --> 00:08:46.510
want to-- you
generally want to bet

00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:49.410
and raise in a way that allows
you to get the last bet in.

00:08:49.410 --> 00:08:52.070
Because with a stronger
draw, your opponent

00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:53.280
gets to make a decision.

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:56.187
But even if they have the
nuts, you still have nine outs.

00:08:56.187 --> 00:08:57.770
And with a more
vulnerable good hand--

00:08:57.770 --> 00:08:59.353
I mean, if your
opponent has the nuts,

00:08:59.353 --> 00:09:01.230
I guess you're kind
of dead, but you're

00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:03.270
sort of protecting the
times you go all-in

00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:04.740
with your stronger draws.

00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:07.710
So following that principle,
I decide to just call here

00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:11.760
because if I raise, then I have
to make a decision when he goes

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:12.750
all-in--

00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:15.930
whether to call with my
medium-strength hand and pretty

00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:17.491
good draw.

00:09:17.491 --> 00:09:21.130
OK, so we call, and the
river's an ace of spades.

00:09:21.130 --> 00:09:26.500
So we completely miss, and
our opponent checks to us.

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:28.640
So we decide to bluff
the river for 70.

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:31.380
And this is sort of the main
decision I want to analyze,

00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:34.700
and it's going to be quite
a complicated decision.

00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:36.970
So let's do some quick analysis.

00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:39.400
So yes, we do have
some chances of winning

00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:40.449
with our pair of eights.

00:09:40.449 --> 00:09:42.490
So maybe you can make a
case that there's no need

00:09:42.490 --> 00:09:44.440
to bluff because
we do have a pair,

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:46.600
but there's a lot
of reasons to bluff.

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:49.870
So one is, there's a lot of
higher cards on the board now.

00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:52.710
The pair of eights-- they
looked pretty good on the flop,

00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:56.230
but now it's a lot worse after
a queen turn and an ace river.

00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:58.750
So we can get him
to fold a queen.

00:09:58.750 --> 00:10:01.090
He can have a queen, and
he could very willingly

00:10:01.090 --> 00:10:03.580
be able to fold it.

00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:05.660
Also, the pot is big.

00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:07.420
They bet the flop
and the turn, and we

00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:08.720
called the flop and the turn.

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:12.250
So both ranges are just very
strong because so much money

00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:13.340
has already gone in.

00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:16.690
So a pair of eights
is not so good.

00:10:16.690 --> 00:10:18.970
If you knew that he had
two random cards, sure,

00:10:18.970 --> 00:10:21.340
a pair of eights will win a
decent percent of the time.

00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:23.298
But when you know you're
up against a hand that

00:10:23.298 --> 00:10:26.020
was willing to bet the
flop and bet the turn,

00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:28.780
it's less likely the
pair of eights is good.

00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:31.390
And then, the ace is
always a scary card.

00:10:31.390 --> 00:10:33.430
And another advantage
of bluffing is--

00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:35.390
this is why position
is so great--

00:10:35.390 --> 00:10:37.930
especially when it's deep
stacked in a cash game.

00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:41.610
We're in position, and we know
that he checked the river.

00:10:41.610 --> 00:10:43.480
So maybe he's trapping
with like king-jack,

00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:46.537
but it's more likely than not
that it's a sign of weakness

00:10:46.537 --> 00:10:47.620
that he checked the river.

00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:52.760
So we could try to
bluff him off his hand.

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:54.779
OK, so what about
river bet sizing?

00:10:54.779 --> 00:10:56.570
So okay, so one thing
is whether the bluff.

00:10:56.570 --> 00:10:58.640
Two, is if you bluff,
how much do you bet?

00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:02.277
So I decided to bet 70 into 107.

00:11:02.277 --> 00:11:04.360
And so what are the things
to consider when you're

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:06.680
deciding your river bet sizing?

00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:09.410
So one is, there's no more
cards to come on the river.

00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:11.984
So in some sense,
there's less of a worry

00:11:11.984 --> 00:11:13.900
to betting really, really
small, because there

00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:17.000
is no such thing as letting
your opponent see a draw.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.040
But it still has a disadvantage.

00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:21.860
Like if your opponent checks
to you and you bet small,

00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:24.144
it still does give them
the option to check-raise.

00:11:24.144 --> 00:11:26.060
So that is one thing you
worry about if you're

00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:27.800
trying to bet really small.

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:29.690
And another thing is,
you should bet big

00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:31.520
if your hand is polarized.

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:34.730
By polarized I mean, you
either have the stone-cold nuts

00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:35.630
or you have a bluff.

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:41.470
Basically, if you bet small
and your range is polarized,

00:11:41.470 --> 00:11:44.420
your opponent can just call
with a very wide range of hands

00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:45.980
because their odds are too good.

00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:49.490
By betting big, you give your
opponent worst odds to call,

00:11:49.490 --> 00:11:54.230
and since you have a stone-cold
bluff some percent of the time,

00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:56.670
you don't want your opponent
to have the odds to call

00:11:56.670 --> 00:11:59.670
with like third pair.

00:11:59.670 --> 00:12:02.640
OK so, it doesn't
matter what they

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:04.710
did, because our
decision is betting 70.

00:12:04.710 --> 00:12:06.530
OK, so now what I
sort of want to do

00:12:06.530 --> 00:12:08.420
is, a lot happened
this hand, right?

00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:12.180
We know they raised the
preflop, bet flop, bet turn,

00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:13.310
checked river.

00:12:13.310 --> 00:12:16.620
So in some sense, we have
a ton of information.

00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:19.280
So in the tournaments that you
play, maybe a hand like this

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:21.210
doesn't show up that
often because often it's

00:12:21.210 --> 00:12:24.980
just an all-in preflop, and you
can't really deduce that much

00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:26.210
about your opponent's hand.

00:12:26.210 --> 00:12:29.640
It's just like, he has the
top 30% of hands or something.

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:32.240
But here, we can actually
do a lot of deduction.

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:36.290
So let's replay the hand from
our opponent's perspective

00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:39.780
and sort of exploitatively
put them on a range.

00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:42.000
So let's go put ourselves
in our opponent's shoes

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.580
and consider all the
actions they did.

00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:47.220
So I'm going to use
exploitative analysis here.

00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:49.190
So there are some
flaws with this.

00:12:49.190 --> 00:12:51.740
We are sort of
arrogantly assuming

00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:53.570
we're one step ahead
of our opponent--

00:12:53.570 --> 00:12:56.030
we can build a mathematical
model for our opponent.

00:12:56.030 --> 00:12:58.100
But still, this is a
useful exercise even

00:12:58.100 --> 00:12:59.900
though, yes, there are flaws.

00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:01.580
Maybe he's one step ahead of us.

00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:03.680
Maybe there's flaws in
our probabilistic model.

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:06.380
But let's just assume for
the sake of the exercise

00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:08.120
that we can do this pretty well.

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:13.460
OK, so first of all, preflop,
what's our opponent's range?

00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:16.340
Let's just say, roughly,
he's opening from the cutoff.

00:13:16.340 --> 00:13:18.680
Let's say he's opening
about 30% of hands.

00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:21.440
I think that's about reasonable
for like an average player,

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:23.990
and I think it's consistent
with the guidelines

00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:25.270
I gave in the first lecture.

00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:29.840
So this includes any pair, any
suited ace, any two Broadway

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:32.010
cards, which are
cards 10 and higher.

00:13:32.010 --> 00:13:35.390
It includes suited hands as
bad as five-three suited.

00:13:35.390 --> 00:13:37.580
This is maybe one difference
between cash games

00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:40.370
and tournaments, where
five-three suited

00:13:40.370 --> 00:13:43.460
is a pretty bad hand in
tournaments when it's so short;

00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:45.860
but when it's 100
big blinds deep,

00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:47.930
a hand like five-three
suited is a lot better

00:13:47.930 --> 00:13:50.980
than a hand like 10-8 offsuit.

00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:52.730
So yeah, so it includes
five-three suited,

00:13:52.730 --> 00:13:55.940
but not like nine-eight
off or like king-seven off,

00:13:55.940 --> 00:13:59.840
which are just terrible hands
when it's 100 big blinds deep.

00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:03.360
So OK, so what's our
opponent's range here?

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:05.410
So they decided to
continuation the bet.

00:14:05.410 --> 00:14:09.200
They continuation bet into
the flop against two players

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:12.020
after the big blind check.

00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:14.510
So what can we put him on?

00:14:14.510 --> 00:14:16.850
OK, so this is a
complicated analysis,

00:14:16.850 --> 00:14:19.070
and you can't really do
this during the game itself,

00:14:19.070 --> 00:14:21.620
but it's very useful to
do it after the hand.

00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:23.570
So let's review
the factors of why

00:14:23.570 --> 00:14:26.060
a player would continuation
bet and then consider

00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:29.390
why he continuation bets.

00:14:29.390 --> 00:14:32.200
OK, so this is also
sort of a review

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:33.440
class since the last class.

00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:35.777
So what are the incentives
for continuation betting?

00:14:35.777 --> 00:14:37.610
Well, your hand is good
enough that it beats

00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:38.776
most of their calling hands.

00:14:38.776 --> 00:14:42.839
So you're betting for value or
your showdown value is poor,

00:14:42.839 --> 00:14:43.880
but you have some equity.

00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:44.780
You have some backdoor equity.

00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:46.490
You have some
overcards or draws,

00:14:46.490 --> 00:14:48.860
and you're,
essentially, bluffing.

00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:51.560
Another incentive is, you're
out of position like he is,

00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:53.660
and it's not like he
can see a free turn

00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:57.380
card by checking because I
can still bet if he checks.

00:14:57.380 --> 00:15:01.490
So you want to bet-- few
opponents, you want to bet.

00:15:01.490 --> 00:15:03.990
Incentives against
continuation betting--

00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:06.710
one is, your hand is
so dominant that you

00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:09.210
need to give him a turn card
to hope that he improves.

00:15:09.210 --> 00:15:10.310
So this is like the trap--

00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:12.137
the slow play.

00:15:12.137 --> 00:15:14.470
You have decent showdown
value, but not amazing showdown

00:15:14.470 --> 00:15:17.096
value-- so like, middle pair.

00:15:17.096 --> 00:15:18.470
You don't want a
continuation bet

00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:21.590
if you have like zero equity
on a reasonably dry board

00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:24.050
like this one.

00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:26.236
And there's too many
people for you to fold out

00:15:26.236 --> 00:15:28.610
or-- like you're in position,
and you can see a free turn

00:15:28.610 --> 00:15:29.380
by checking.

00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:31.400
So there's a lot of
things but, still,

00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:33.330
let's look at the
situation again keeping

00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:34.580
some of those factors in mind.

00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:38.544
He continuation bet into 10,
eight, six rainbow, which

00:15:38.544 --> 00:15:39.710
means three different suits.

00:15:44.430 --> 00:15:49.857
OK, so actually, before
I show this slide,

00:15:49.857 --> 00:15:51.440
I'm going to use the
annotate feature,

00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:56.010
and we'll try to write
on here what hands we

00:15:56.010 --> 00:15:56.820
think he can have.

00:15:56.820 --> 00:15:58.440
So this is going
to take a while,

00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:01.140
but I plan on spending
the next 20, 25

00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:02.470
minutes discussing this hand.

00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:05.360
OK, so does someone want
to say a hand that you

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:07.667
think is in this range at
this point in the hand?

00:16:07.667 --> 00:16:10.000
Pretend we don't know what
he's going to do on the turn.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.030
Yeah, just at this
point in the hand,

00:16:12.030 --> 00:16:15.750
can someone tell me a hand
you think is in his range?

00:16:15.750 --> 00:16:16.366
Yeah?

00:16:16.366 --> 00:16:17.674
AUDIENCE: Ace-jack.

00:16:17.674 --> 00:16:19.350
WILL MA: OK, yeah, ace/jack.

00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:21.442
OK, I think that's reasonable.

00:16:21.442 --> 00:16:22.900
It's actually, I
think, a bit weak.

00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:27.870
But let's say like ace/jack
suited with a backdoor flush

00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:28.440
draw.

00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:29.981
OK, I'll write down
ace-jack for now.

00:16:29.981 --> 00:16:31.984
OK, so someone go and
tell me another hand.

00:16:31.984 --> 00:16:32.484
Yeah?

00:16:32.484 --> 00:16:33.609
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] pair.

00:16:33.609 --> 00:16:35.540
Maybe 9-10, 10-jack suited?

00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:36.640
Ace-10?

00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:39.750
WILL MA: OK, ace-10--

00:16:39.750 --> 00:16:43.470
sure, jack-10-- 10-9--

00:16:43.470 --> 00:16:45.000
OK.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.697
Someone want to tell me
another type of hand maybe?

00:16:48.697 --> 00:16:49.196
Yeah?

00:16:49.196 --> 00:16:50.680
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
pocket jacks?

00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:50.990
WILL MA: OK, good.

00:16:50.990 --> 00:16:51.795
Pocket jacks, yeah.

00:16:51.795 --> 00:16:53.520
So that's a clear value hand.

00:16:57.320 --> 00:16:59.480
Someone want to tell me
another type of hand?

00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:01.130
AUDIENCE: What about queen-jack?

00:17:01.130 --> 00:17:01.590
WILL MA: Queen-jack.

00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:02.350
OK, that's a good idea.

00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:03.350
Yeah, that's a good one.

00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:06.420
So Queen-jack I think is
one of the best draws--

00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:10.225
not the best draw-- what is
the best draw, would you say?

00:17:10.225 --> 00:17:12.909
AUDIENCE: Queen-jack of clubs?

00:17:12.909 --> 00:17:15.450
WILL MA: Queen-jack of clubs,
yeah, but queen of clubs only--

00:17:15.450 --> 00:17:17.207
it's not the best
straight draw, right?

00:17:17.207 --> 00:17:17.790
Yeah, what's--

00:17:17.790 --> 00:17:19.000
AUDIENCE: Jack-nine.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.041
WILL MA: Yeah, jack-nine.

00:17:20.041 --> 00:17:22.589
Jack-nine or queen-nine.

00:17:22.589 --> 00:17:24.165
I wrote some hands here.

00:17:24.165 --> 00:17:28.440
OK, jack-nine, or queen-nine,
or like five-seven.

00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:29.600
OK.

00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:31.230
AUDIENCE: One pair of sixes.

00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:31.940
Is it possible?

00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:32.920
WILL MA: Pocket sixes?

00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:33.150
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:17:33.150 --> 00:17:33.990
WILL MA: Yeah, yeah,
OK, that's good.

00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:35.220
So I'll write that down.

00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:37.257
So pocket sixes, good.

00:17:37.257 --> 00:17:39.090
OK, here's a question,
what do you guys want

00:17:39.090 --> 00:17:45.840
to put him on if he has a
really, really good hand?

00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:47.280
So this is open ended.

00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:48.780
I didn't come with
a [INAUDIBLE]..

00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:52.080
You guys want to assume that
he checks with pocket 10s

00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:54.540
and like nine-seven--
basically the absolute best

00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:56.520
hands on this board to trap us?

00:17:56.520 --> 00:17:58.277
Or do you want to
assume that he bets?

00:18:01.801 --> 00:18:02.300
Yeah?

00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:03.924
AUDIENCE: I think if
he has nine-seven,

00:18:03.924 --> 00:18:06.260
he'd probably bet because
someone might get a better

00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:07.386
straight if he doesn't bet.

00:18:07.386 --> 00:18:09.426
WILL MA: OK, yeah that's
a reasonable assumption.

00:18:09.426 --> 00:18:12.140
I think it can go either way
with nine-seven and like pocket

00:18:12.140 --> 00:18:13.040
10s--

00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:14.450
depending on our opponent.

00:18:14.450 --> 00:18:16.125
Pocket sixes, I
think, is a clear bet,

00:18:16.125 --> 00:18:17.270
whereas pocket 10s is not.

00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:19.790
Because pocket 10s--
you're taking away so many

00:18:19.790 --> 00:18:22.050
of the top hands
from your opponents,

00:18:22.050 --> 00:18:25.950
whereas pocket sixes just gets
so much value when you bet.

00:18:25.950 --> 00:18:29.180
OK, so roughly speaking,
I sort of categorized

00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:31.950
all the hands he could
have into five categories.

00:18:31.950 --> 00:18:33.695
So the first-- the
top is hands that

00:18:33.695 --> 00:18:36.500
are so good that he checks
to trap or check-raise.

00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:38.090
The second category
is like the hands

00:18:38.090 --> 00:18:40.420
that are good but not
that good-- he value bets.

00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:42.010
Then it's like
medium-strength hands

00:18:42.010 --> 00:18:45.389
that he checks to check-call.

00:18:45.389 --> 00:18:47.430
So this doesn't agree with
exactly what we wrote,

00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:48.013
but that's OK.

00:18:48.013 --> 00:18:49.910
But this is just roughly--

00:18:49.910 --> 00:18:53.031
and then the next category
is hands that he bluffs.

00:18:53.031 --> 00:18:55.530
And then the last category is
hands that he just check-folds

00:18:55.530 --> 00:18:56.738
because they have no equity--

00:18:56.738 --> 00:18:59.240
like pocket threes, where he
would just give up the hand.

00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:02.631
So we basically crossed
off these three categories

00:19:02.631 --> 00:19:04.130
because with these
three categories,

00:19:04.130 --> 00:19:07.940
he would check, whereas the
top one, he's checking to trap;

00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:10.070
the second one, he's
checking for a showdown;

00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:11.927
and the last one, he's
checking to give up.

00:19:11.927 --> 00:19:13.760
And then the two types
of hands he's betting

00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:19.760
are, essentially, value bets
and like draws or bluffs.

00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:22.420
OK, so now let's consider
the situation on the turn.

00:19:25.850 --> 00:19:29.390
OK, so once again, let's
consider his incentives first

00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:31.521
for betting again on the turn.

00:19:31.521 --> 00:19:33.020
Sorry if this is a
bit hard to read.

00:19:33.020 --> 00:19:41.320
Maybe I should do it on
notepad so that the annotate

00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:42.000
isn't annoying.

00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:46.670
Sorry, just give me a sec.

00:19:56.918 --> 00:20:00.030
OK, so what are the incentives
for betting again on the turn?

00:20:00.030 --> 00:20:02.280
So one is, you bet a good
hand for value on the flop,

00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:04.680
and your hand is still
good on the turn.

00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:06.320
So you're getting
for more value.

00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:08.730
Two is, you bluffed a
speculative hand on the flop

00:20:08.730 --> 00:20:10.380
and now you either
hit the turn--

00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:13.260
like the queen helped you--
so like if you had jack-nine

00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:16.080
or you improved your draw--

00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:18.990
or like an overcard to the
board came, which was the case,

00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:22.350
and maybe you thought bluffing
the turn could be good.

00:20:22.350 --> 00:20:25.020
So OK, so he bet the turn.

00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:27.210
OK, so let's maybe
put the hands we think

00:20:27.210 --> 00:20:29.670
he could have into PokerStove.

00:20:29.670 --> 00:20:32.280
So yeah, I think that's
the easiest way to do it.

00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:33.480
OK, so let's do this.

00:20:36.830 --> 00:20:38.570
OK, so roughly speaking--

00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:39.580
can everyone see this?

00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:42.070
This is easy enough
to see, right?

00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:44.080
OK, so let's do this.

00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:44.840
So bear with me.

00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:47.700
This is a meticulous exercise.

00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:51.780
OK, so let's say preflop, 30%--

00:20:51.780 --> 00:20:53.480
OK, this is about reasonable.

00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:55.720
Actually, let me give
him a few more pairs.

00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:57.910
I'll take away ace-six off.

00:20:57.910 --> 00:21:01.560
Let's say he goes
suited connectors down

00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:04.935
to five-four suited,
suited one gappers down

00:21:04.935 --> 00:21:08.820
to five-three suited--
suited two gappers.

00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:11.700
So suited two gappers
means suited cards

00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:14.650
that are three
apart, essentially.

00:21:14.650 --> 00:21:17.760
Yeah, you have like eight-five
suited, something like this.

00:21:20.437 --> 00:21:22.020
Something like this
is fine, probably,

00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:23.760
but let's say he
plays 10-6 suited.

00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:25.390
OK, something like this--

00:21:25.390 --> 00:21:28.476
maybe take away some of
the worst offsuit hands.

00:21:28.476 --> 00:21:29.600
OK, so something like this.

00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:30.180
OK, good.

00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:31.530
So on the flop, what happened?

00:21:31.530 --> 00:21:34.770
On the flop-- we said, OK,
so let's eliminate hands.

00:21:34.770 --> 00:21:35.835
What can we eliminate?

00:21:35.835 --> 00:21:38.795
So this is his entire range
of possibilities, preflop.

00:21:38.795 --> 00:21:40.950
OK, so on the flop,
we're going to eliminate

00:21:40.950 --> 00:21:45.150
pocket twos, threes, fours, and
fives because he just gives up.

00:21:45.150 --> 00:21:46.620
Pocket sevens and
nines we're going

00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:49.920
to eliminate because we're
going to assume he checks.

00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:55.375
Five-three is bad enough
we can assume he gives up.

00:21:55.375 --> 00:22:03.060
Let me just display the
flop so that we can see.

00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:05.190
OK, so what else?

00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:07.229
OK, so let's go
through everything.

00:22:07.229 --> 00:22:08.520
I'll deal with this a bit fast.

00:22:11.210 --> 00:22:12.977
OK, let's say all
the middle pairs--

00:22:12.977 --> 00:22:13.810
he's going to check.

00:22:13.810 --> 00:22:16.810
So I'm going to remove most
of the hands with an eight

00:22:16.810 --> 00:22:17.310
in them--

00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:22.410
yeah, so ace-eight, king-eight,
queen-eight, jack, OK,

00:22:22.410 --> 00:22:23.493
so 10-8 he's going to bet.

00:22:23.493 --> 00:22:25.790
AUDIENCE: You do that just
because you have an eight?

00:22:25.790 --> 00:22:26.730
AUDIENCE: Pretty much.

00:22:26.730 --> 00:22:29.850
WILL MA: Yeah, so we will
take that into account.

00:22:29.850 --> 00:22:31.942
But he could still
have an eight, right?

00:22:31.942 --> 00:22:32.900
But yeah, you're right.

00:22:32.900 --> 00:22:35.210
It is less likely, and we
will take it into account

00:22:35.210 --> 00:22:37.100
at the very end.

00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:38.540
So ace-five, let's assume--

00:22:38.540 --> 00:22:40.970
let's assume a lot of
these offsuit aces,

00:22:40.970 --> 00:22:45.680
he gives up because even with
overcards but with no backdoor

00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:51.300
flush draw on a dry board,
I think is kind of scary.

00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:53.845
OK, so let's say something
like this on the flop--

00:22:53.845 --> 00:22:55.670
eight-five, let's
eliminate that.

00:22:55.670 --> 00:22:57.636
Eight-seven, I
think he'll check.

00:22:57.636 --> 00:22:59.510
So nine-seven, we're
going to assume he bets.

00:22:59.510 --> 00:23:01.195
Let's assume he
checks pocket 10s.

00:23:01.195 --> 00:23:02.570
Let's assumes he
also checks some

00:23:02.570 --> 00:23:10.090
of the weaker
10s-- like jack-10,

00:23:10.090 --> 00:23:12.510
let's suppose he checks.

00:23:12.510 --> 00:23:14.375
Maybe 10-9, he checks as well.

00:23:14.375 --> 00:23:15.105
10-7, he checks.

00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:21.977
OK, nine-eight he checks.

00:23:21.977 --> 00:23:23.060
OK, am I missing anything?

00:23:23.060 --> 00:23:25.330
Did someone see something
you disagree with?

00:23:25.330 --> 00:23:26.640
King-queen off, king-jack off--

00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:28.320
I think those are
too weak, too--

00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:30.890
that end of this board--

00:23:30.890 --> 00:23:34.675
queen-nine, king-nine
suited, ace-nine down here.

00:23:34.675 --> 00:23:37.570
OK, I think this is roughly--

00:23:37.570 --> 00:23:39.475
it'll get easier on
the turn, basically.

00:23:39.475 --> 00:23:43.452
OK, So let's say this is what
he's going to have on the flop.

00:23:43.452 --> 00:23:44.910
Actually, some of
these weaker aces

00:23:44.910 --> 00:23:46.160
probably should be eliminated.

00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:49.350
OK, let's eliminate everything
down to ace-five and below.

00:23:49.350 --> 00:23:50.920
Ace-seven and
ace-nine we'll keep in

00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:52.211
because he has a straight draw.

00:23:55.580 --> 00:23:58.440
OK, so on the turn,
he bets again.

00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:01.172
So did someone want to
suggest a hand that maybe we

00:24:01.172 --> 00:24:02.880
should eliminate
because he bet the turn?

00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:06.250
Yeah?

00:24:06.250 --> 00:24:07.750
AUDIENCE: Only
weak 10s, I guess?

00:24:07.750 --> 00:24:08.310
WILL MA: OK, good.

00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:09.976
Yeah, I think that's
a very good answer.

00:24:09.976 --> 00:24:12.940
So let's get rid of ace-10
and king-10 because those

00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:15.460
are no longer good hands-- or
they're no longer, I think,

00:24:15.460 --> 00:24:18.120
hands that you want to really
continue betting for value,

00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:18.630
right?

00:24:18.630 --> 00:24:20.950
Queen-10 is good because
you hit two pair.

00:24:20.950 --> 00:24:25.210
OK, is there another hand
that's of a similar category?

00:24:25.210 --> 00:24:28.420
So I guess pocket jacks is
of a similar category, right?

00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:32.350
It's not as good as it once was.

00:24:32.350 --> 00:24:34.507
OK, so what are some
other hands maybe you

00:24:34.507 --> 00:24:35.590
don't want to bluff with--

00:24:35.590 --> 00:24:37.048
you don't want to
bet with anymore?

00:24:44.802 --> 00:24:46.260
Are there any hands
you think maybe

00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:48.220
he would just give up because--

00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:50.476
AUDIENCE: The six-five.

00:24:50.476 --> 00:24:52.265
WILL MA: Yeah, I think
that's reasonable.

00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:57.300
Most of these, we
can assume he's

00:24:57.300 --> 00:25:01.770
going to give up on the queen,
like five-four, especially.

00:25:01.770 --> 00:25:03.819
So on the flop, he didn't
even have a great hand.

00:25:03.819 --> 00:25:05.110
It was just drawing to a seven.

00:25:05.110 --> 00:25:07.050
But now, it's sort of worse.

00:25:07.050 --> 00:25:08.730
So yeah, let's get
rid of five-four.

00:25:11.384 --> 00:25:13.050
Do you think they
would continue betting

00:25:13.050 --> 00:25:17.300
like nine-six or seven-six?

00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:19.800
Yeah, even seven-five
is a pretty bad--

00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:22.970
is a lot worse after the
queen because seven-five

00:25:22.970 --> 00:25:25.150
was like drawing to a nine.

00:25:25.150 --> 00:25:27.780
But now, when the
queen comes, the nine

00:25:27.780 --> 00:25:30.960
is not a good card because
you still lose to a jack.

00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:33.110
So maybe we can get
rid of that one.

00:25:33.110 --> 00:25:35.370
Do you think they
definitely continue

00:25:35.370 --> 00:25:37.660
betting with ace-king,
ace-queen, ace-jack in all

00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:38.160
those?

00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:43.824
Yeah?

00:25:43.824 --> 00:25:45.564
AUDIENCE: Maybe if
they had ace-queen,

00:25:45.564 --> 00:25:48.554
they would keep it [INAUDIBLE]
pretend to [INAUDIBLE]..

00:25:48.554 --> 00:25:50.470
WILL MA: Yeah, so
ace-queen, I think, is good.

00:25:50.470 --> 00:25:52.735
All right, so I think
this is [INAUDIBLE] good.

00:25:52.735 --> 00:25:54.145
Ace-nine-- some
of these hands, I

00:25:54.145 --> 00:25:56.020
think they would probably
stop bluffing with.

00:25:56.020 --> 00:25:59.360
Like I think jack-seven
suited is pretty--

00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:03.410
maybe some of the sixes
also, I think, it's hard to--

00:26:03.410 --> 00:26:05.100
even like ace-seven
suited, I think

00:26:05.100 --> 00:26:06.470
it's hard to continue bluffing.

00:26:06.470 --> 00:26:07.886
Because as we see,
there's already

00:26:07.886 --> 00:26:10.370
enough hands with draws, right?

00:26:10.370 --> 00:26:13.340
There are already a lot of
bluffs here like king-jack,

00:26:13.340 --> 00:26:15.010
ace-king--

00:26:15.010 --> 00:26:17.590
I guess like
queen-nine, nine-six,

00:26:17.590 --> 00:26:20.000
some of these-- so yeah,
maybe he'll bluff with these,

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.890
but OK, let's get rid of these.

00:26:22.890 --> 00:26:27.900
OK, so we've sort of cut
down his range a bit.

00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:31.070
So now it's a river
situation, and he checks.

00:26:31.070 --> 00:26:32.190
So what does this mean?

00:26:32.190 --> 00:26:34.610
Well, it seems improbable
that their opponent

00:26:34.610 --> 00:26:36.740
would be trying to
trap us with this check

00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:40.170
because he's already been
showing plenty of aggression.

00:26:40.170 --> 00:26:42.020
So it's hard for him
to pretend he suddenly

00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:44.265
has a bad hand by checking.

00:26:44.265 --> 00:26:46.100
And with the pot
already so big, he

00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:49.280
can get a large percent of our
remaining stack into the pot

00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:51.680
just by betting instead
of check-raising.

00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:56.680
So it seems like it's less
likely he's checking as a trap.

00:26:56.680 --> 00:26:59.110
And also, the ace is
sort of a better card

00:26:59.110 --> 00:27:01.130
for his range than
ours because he's

00:27:01.130 --> 00:27:03.560
the one who's been
betting, so having draws,

00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:05.390
having overcards like aces--

00:27:05.390 --> 00:27:10.760
and for us, we're much less
likely than him to have an ace.

00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:12.500
So if it's a better
card for his range,

00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:15.500
he should be betting both for
value and with his bluffs.

00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:17.780
So that being said,
so let's suppose

00:27:17.780 --> 00:27:20.480
we assume it's
sort of unlikely he

00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:23.000
has a really, really good
hand, but he could so easily

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:27.350
have a hand that beats ours
and calls our potential bluff.

00:27:27.350 --> 00:27:31.370
So OK, so now let's go back
to PokerStove and eliminate

00:27:31.370 --> 00:27:32.120
some more hands.

00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:34.140
OK, so what are some
hands we can eliminate

00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:35.680
after he checks the river?

00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:36.797
AUDIENCE: Aces.

00:27:36.797 --> 00:27:37.630
WILL MA: Aces, yeah.

00:27:37.630 --> 00:27:38.890
I think that's a good one.

00:27:38.890 --> 00:27:42.197
I think aces, pretty clearly,
he'll bet again on the river.

00:27:42.197 --> 00:27:43.030
What's another hand?

00:27:43.030 --> 00:27:44.260
AUDIENCE: King-jack.

00:27:44.260 --> 00:27:46.080
WILL MA: Yeah, king-jack
I think he might.

00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:47.630
OK, so let's eliminate
all other good hands

00:27:47.630 --> 00:27:49.270
that we think he's going
to continuation bet, right?

00:27:49.270 --> 00:27:51.170
I think with any
straight, I think

00:27:51.170 --> 00:27:52.930
it's reasonable to
assume they're just

00:27:52.930 --> 00:27:53.846
going to keep betting.

00:27:53.846 --> 00:27:55.850
Like nine-seven-- even
though it's nowhere near

00:27:55.850 --> 00:27:59.020
the monster it was
on the flop, it still

00:27:59.020 --> 00:28:00.890
only loses to jack-nine
and king-jack.

00:28:00.890 --> 00:28:03.470
So let's get rid of that one.

00:28:03.470 --> 00:28:05.650
AUDIENCE: Certainly
like ace-queen--

00:28:05.650 --> 00:28:06.280
all those.

00:28:09.290 --> 00:28:12.650
WILL MA: Yeah, I think most
strong two pairs I think,

00:28:12.650 --> 00:28:14.210
definitely, he'll keep betting.

00:28:14.210 --> 00:28:15.750
So let's get rid of that.

00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:17.300
Let's get rid of ace-queen.

00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:20.140
Let's get rid of queen-queen.

00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:21.370
Let's get rid of queen-10.

00:28:21.370 --> 00:28:24.530
I think queen-10 is good enough.

00:28:24.530 --> 00:28:27.130
Ace-eight-- let's
get rid of that one--

00:28:27.130 --> 00:28:28.225
yeah, that's good enough.

00:28:28.225 --> 00:28:30.350
Pocket eights, pocket sixes
I think is good enough.

00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:33.710
OK, good.

00:28:33.710 --> 00:28:36.650
So OK, we've got
some hands here--

00:28:36.650 --> 00:28:38.600
basically, all the
good hands we removed--

00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:41.050
all the really good
hands that he bets again.

00:28:41.050 --> 00:28:42.500
What do you guys
think about 10-8?

00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:45.150
I guess it doesn't
matter too much.

00:28:45.150 --> 00:28:47.870
Let's assume he checks
10-8 because by this river,

00:28:47.870 --> 00:28:50.600
10-8 is no longer the
powerhouse it was.

00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:52.190
Oh, I've got to get
rid of jack-nine.

00:28:52.190 --> 00:28:55.580
OK, what are some other hands
you think we can eliminate?

00:28:55.580 --> 00:28:57.830
So there there's actually
another category of hands

00:28:57.830 --> 00:28:59.580
we could, potentially,
eliminate here.

00:29:02.110 --> 00:29:02.610
Yeah?

00:29:02.610 --> 00:29:06.786
AUDIENCE: He would
probably bet an ace.

00:29:06.786 --> 00:29:11.292
WILL MA: Well an ace
isn't that good of a hand.

00:29:11.292 --> 00:29:13.000
So this is one problem
with this analysis

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.284
is, it is very
subject to debate what

00:29:15.284 --> 00:29:16.450
we think about our opponent.

00:29:16.450 --> 00:29:19.480
But for the sake of
this exercise, I'd say--

00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:20.920
I mean also I
think in practice--

00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:23.895
I think it's not clear that you
should value bet an ace here.

00:29:23.895 --> 00:29:25.353
Because there's
just a lot of stuff

00:29:25.353 --> 00:29:27.850
that beats you-- a lot of
straights, a lot of two pairs.

00:29:27.850 --> 00:29:29.558
I think that even if
you have a ace-king,

00:29:29.558 --> 00:29:31.600
you shouldn't really
be confident enough

00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:32.700
in your hand to bet.

00:29:32.700 --> 00:29:34.990
Like maybe ace-king is
marginal but definitely

00:29:34.990 --> 00:29:38.160
not like ace-seven.

00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:39.510
Yeah?

00:29:39.510 --> 00:29:41.990
AUDIENCE: Bluff bets-- so like
weak hands, maybe six-four.

00:29:41.990 --> 00:29:42.906
WILL MA: Great, great.

00:29:42.906 --> 00:29:45.100
Yeah, exactly, so that's
what I wanted to hear.

00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:47.900
So we can also eliminate some
of his really weak hands.

00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:48.590
This is crucial.

00:29:48.590 --> 00:29:50.030
This is an easy thing to miss.

00:29:50.030 --> 00:29:52.170
We can probably
assume he's not going

00:29:52.170 --> 00:29:55.975
to have king-seven because
the ace is a reasonable card

00:29:55.975 --> 00:29:57.061
to bluff.

00:29:57.061 --> 00:29:59.060
It's not great-- it's not
like the ace of clubs,

00:29:59.060 --> 00:30:00.976
which would be a better
card for him to bluff,

00:30:00.976 --> 00:30:02.180
but if he's got nothing--

00:30:02.180 --> 00:30:04.160
like if he just
completely missed--

00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:05.790
probably-- I mean,
let's assume you

00:30:05.790 --> 00:30:07.722
know these guys are
pretty good players.

00:30:07.722 --> 00:30:08.930
He's probably going to bluff.

00:30:08.930 --> 00:30:12.560
So let's assume he
at least has a pair.

00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:15.380
He has some showdown value,
because if he had zero showdown

00:30:15.380 --> 00:30:16.610
value, he would have bluffed.

00:30:16.610 --> 00:30:21.930
So let's get rid of king-seven,
let's get rid of king-nine.

00:30:21.930 --> 00:30:26.870
Six-five six-four-- I
think, definitely, he

00:30:26.870 --> 00:30:28.790
should be bluffing,
but maybe some players

00:30:28.790 --> 00:30:30.530
will see a pair of
sixes and say, oh I

00:30:30.530 --> 00:30:31.850
have enough showdown value.

00:30:31.850 --> 00:30:33.933
So let's get rid of one
of them but not the other.

00:30:33.933 --> 00:30:35.100
Maybe that's reasonable.

00:30:35.100 --> 00:30:36.667
So let's get rid of two.

00:30:36.667 --> 00:30:38.250
So let's get of
six-four and seven-six

00:30:38.250 --> 00:30:39.990
but keep in six-five
and nine-six.

00:30:42.790 --> 00:30:48.050
OK, so we leave
ourselves with these.

00:30:48.050 --> 00:30:50.450
OK, so this seems about
reasonable, I think.

00:30:55.630 --> 00:30:59.419
Let's eliminate ace-seven.

00:30:59.419 --> 00:31:01.460
I think we should have
eliminated it on the turn.

00:31:01.460 --> 00:31:04.126
Maybe like ace-seven of clubs we
can-- oh no, ace-seven of clubs

00:31:04.126 --> 00:31:07.680
he can't have because we
have the seven of clubs.

00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:10.280
I think any other ace-seven
other than the ace-seven

00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:13.640
of clubs is kind of bad to bet
on the turn because the seven

00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:16.710
isn't really that
good of a card to--

00:31:16.710 --> 00:31:18.050
isn't that good of a draw.

00:31:18.050 --> 00:31:20.870
So let's get rid of ace-seven.

00:31:20.870 --> 00:31:22.400
So let's just suppose it's this.

00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:26.260
OK, so that was a lot of work.

00:31:26.260 --> 00:31:30.410
OK, so now roughly
speaking, we can

00:31:30.410 --> 00:31:33.800
conclude his range on the
river is something like this.

00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:35.540
So let's assume that
he's going to call

00:31:35.540 --> 00:31:37.430
with top pair or better.

00:31:37.430 --> 00:31:39.590
Once again, this is a
pretty strong assumption,

00:31:39.590 --> 00:31:41.694
but let's suppose
this is the way

00:31:41.694 --> 00:31:42.860
we think he's going to play.

00:31:42.860 --> 00:31:45.680
He's going to call if
he has an ace or better

00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:47.690
and fold other ones.

00:31:47.690 --> 00:31:52.310
So we're risking 70 to win 100.

00:31:52.310 --> 00:31:54.394
So let's do an exact
calculation now

00:31:54.394 --> 00:31:56.060
of how many combinations
of these hands.

00:31:58.820 --> 00:31:59.820
I'll do this on Notepad.

00:32:04.870 --> 00:32:07.955
OK, let me pull up the board.

00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:22.340
OK, hopefully,
people can see this.

00:32:22.340 --> 00:32:24.445
So when I said
combinatorial hand analysis,

00:32:24.445 --> 00:32:25.820
I mean we're going
to, basically,

00:32:25.820 --> 00:32:27.170
count the combinations.

00:32:27.170 --> 00:32:29.180
And like you pointed
out, this is--

00:32:29.180 --> 00:32:31.860
oh crap, did I accidentally
get rid of that?

00:32:31.860 --> 00:32:33.820
Oh, that's not good.

00:32:33.820 --> 00:32:36.050
OK, let me quickly put it back.

00:32:36.050 --> 00:32:40.450
So OK, we had kings left,
ace-king, ace-jack, ace-nine,

00:32:40.450 --> 00:32:48.920
king-queen, queen-jack,
queen-nine, what else?

00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:55.130
10-8, 10-6, eight-six--
we had some sixes, right?

00:32:55.130 --> 00:33:01.232
Seven-six, six-five--
and is there something

00:33:01.232 --> 00:33:01.940
else I'm missing?

00:33:01.940 --> 00:33:06.560
Does anyone remember
if there's something

00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:09.604
I'm forgetting to check off?

00:33:09.604 --> 00:33:11.020
I knocked queen-nine
off, I guess.

00:33:11.020 --> 00:33:11.880
I think this about right.

00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:13.660
Maybe I'm missing like
one or two things.

00:33:20.865 --> 00:33:21.740
No one sees anything?

00:33:21.740 --> 00:33:26.020
I think this is approximately
what we had, right?

00:33:26.020 --> 00:33:29.780
OK, hopefully I
didn't miss enough

00:33:29.780 --> 00:33:31.280
that it drastically changes.

00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:32.700
It shouldn't.

00:33:32.700 --> 00:33:34.240
OK, so let's count
the combinations.

00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:38.420
Because you can look at the
square on the PokerStove and--

00:33:38.420 --> 00:33:40.190
let me clear this
annotation-- sorry,

00:33:40.190 --> 00:33:41.900
I should've done
that a while ago.

00:33:41.900 --> 00:33:46.490
OK, so you can see the
yellow hands on the square

00:33:46.490 --> 00:33:49.740
and roughly see how
many hands of each type.

00:33:49.740 --> 00:33:54.210
There's, essentially, three
types of hands he could have.

00:33:54.210 --> 00:33:59.030
There's hands that call, there's
hands that beat us and call,

00:33:59.030 --> 00:34:01.730
there's hands that
beat us and fold,

00:34:01.730 --> 00:34:06.470
and there's hands
that we beat and fold.

00:34:06.470 --> 00:34:08.929
But the thing is, if you just
look at these yellow squares,

00:34:08.929 --> 00:34:11.929
it won't give you the right
probabilities because we

00:34:11.929 --> 00:34:13.489
have certain cards in our hand.

00:34:13.489 --> 00:34:15.550
And also, because
of the specific ways

00:34:15.550 --> 00:34:17.449
suited combinations
work, there's

00:34:17.449 --> 00:34:19.181
different combinations
of each hand.

00:34:19.181 --> 00:34:20.389
So OK, let's go through this.

00:34:20.389 --> 00:34:24.580
So how many combinations of
ace-king suited are there

00:34:24.580 --> 00:34:27.030
that-- so we assume he
had a backdoor flush draw

00:34:27.030 --> 00:34:29.270
on the flop, but--

00:34:29.270 --> 00:34:33.892
so how many combinations of
ace-king suited are possible?

00:34:33.892 --> 00:34:35.850
Don't worry about the
backdoor flush draw part.

00:34:35.850 --> 00:34:37.308
It doesn't matter
for this example.

00:34:37.308 --> 00:34:39.949
So how many combinations
of ace-king suited, Will?

00:34:39.949 --> 00:34:40.973
Three.

00:34:40.973 --> 00:34:42.139
Because it has to be suited.

00:34:42.139 --> 00:34:44.389
And it can't be spades
because the ace of spades

00:34:44.389 --> 00:34:45.409
is on the board.

00:34:45.409 --> 00:34:48.090
So it's three combinations.

00:34:48.090 --> 00:34:50.268
OK, ace-jack suited?

00:34:50.268 --> 00:34:51.139
AUDIENCE: Three.

00:34:51.139 --> 00:34:52.560
WILL MA: Three, OK, good.

00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:55.424
Ace-nine suited?

00:34:55.424 --> 00:34:56.408
AUDIENCE: Three.

00:34:56.408 --> 00:34:57.139
WILL MA: Three.

00:34:57.139 --> 00:34:59.800
OK, good.

00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:01.585
All right, pocket kings?

00:35:01.585 --> 00:35:03.440
AUDIENCE: About six?

00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:05.240
WILL MA: Right, so
pocket kings is six.

00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:07.281
Because there's no kings;
we don't see any kings,

00:35:07.281 --> 00:35:09.240
and there's no such
thing as suitedness.

00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:11.530
So yeah, so one thing
you realize in this--

00:35:11.530 --> 00:35:14.159
oh, so pocket kings we're
assuming he's going to fold--

00:35:14.159 --> 00:35:15.950
one thing you will
realize in this exercise

00:35:15.950 --> 00:35:18.020
is, you've got to
put a lot of weight

00:35:18.020 --> 00:35:20.120
on the offsuit hands
instead of the suited hands.

00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:23.600
Because the offsuit hands,
combinatorially, have way more

00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:26.030
possibilities-- essentially
three times as many

00:35:26.030 --> 00:35:28.190
possibilities-- as
the suited hands.

00:35:28.190 --> 00:35:31.040
So like this queen-jack
offsuit in here

00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:33.110
has a huge weight
in our calculation.

00:35:33.110 --> 00:35:35.090
That's by far his
most likely hand.

00:35:35.090 --> 00:35:38.600
Because it's the only offsuit
hand we're putting him on.

00:35:38.600 --> 00:35:40.480
Yeah, it's the only offsuit--

00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:43.250
is it really only the offsuit
hand that he could have?

00:35:43.250 --> 00:35:45.200
I guess according
to our analysis,

00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:46.835
we're assuming the
only offsuit hand he

00:35:46.835 --> 00:35:48.230
could have is queen-jack off.

00:35:48.230 --> 00:35:50.438
So how many combinations of
queen-jack off are there?

00:35:54.379 --> 00:35:54.920
AUDIENCE: 12.

00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:56.680
AUDIENCE: 12.

00:35:56.680 --> 00:35:59.530
WILL MA: OK, so let's just
say queen-jack in total.

00:35:59.530 --> 00:36:01.685
Queen-jack suited
plus offsuit is 12.

00:36:01.685 --> 00:36:04.540
Because we see a queen,
so there's four jacks,

00:36:04.540 --> 00:36:06.135
three queens, three
times four is 12.

00:36:06.135 --> 00:36:07.510
It could be suited
or not suited.

00:36:07.510 --> 00:36:09.092
So OK, that counts
for both of those.

00:36:09.092 --> 00:36:10.300
What about king-queen suited?

00:36:13.102 --> 00:36:14.510
AUDIENCE: Three as well?

00:36:14.510 --> 00:36:17.660
WILL MA: So it's three as well,
but I'm going to put it as two

00:36:17.660 --> 00:36:20.900
because I can assume if he
had king-queen of spades,

00:36:20.900 --> 00:36:24.619
which has no flush dras-- like
no runner-runner flush draw

00:36:24.619 --> 00:36:25.160
on the flop--

00:36:25.160 --> 00:36:26.870
I'm going to assume that he
would have folded king-queen

00:36:26.870 --> 00:36:27.786
of spades on the flop.

00:36:27.786 --> 00:36:31.390
So I'm going to give it two.

00:36:31.390 --> 00:36:33.140
OK, so which ones
haven't we done?

00:36:33.140 --> 00:36:37.350
Queen-nine suited,
how many combinations?

00:36:37.350 --> 00:36:38.460
Three?

00:36:38.460 --> 00:36:39.630
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:36:39.630 --> 00:36:44.820
WILL MA: OK, 10-8
suited, these get five.

00:36:44.820 --> 00:36:46.920
So the reason why
10-8 is suited is

00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:49.680
because we're assuming he
doesn't raise 10-8 offsuit

00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:51.040
preflop from that position.

00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:53.770
So that's why 10-8
has to be suited.

00:36:53.770 --> 00:36:56.220
So how many combinations
of 10-8 suited?

00:36:56.220 --> 00:36:57.000
Two.

00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:59.310
OK, how many combinations
of 10-6 suited?

00:36:59.310 --> 00:37:00.750
AUDIENCE: Two as well.

00:37:00.750 --> 00:37:01.350
WILL MA: Two.

00:37:01.350 --> 00:37:04.962
How many combinations
of eight-six suited?

00:37:04.962 --> 00:37:05.830
AUDIENCE: One?

00:37:05.830 --> 00:37:06.590
WILL MA: One, yes.

00:37:06.590 --> 00:37:07.089
OK.

00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:13.570
I miscategorized this one.

00:37:13.570 --> 00:37:16.550
So queen-nine is in this
category that he's folding.

00:37:16.550 --> 00:37:20.000
These are all the hands that
call our bluff and beat us.

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:22.160
And so the last
category is the hands

00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:24.860
that we can actually
beat if we check it down.

00:37:24.860 --> 00:37:25.910
So it's very small.

00:37:25.910 --> 00:37:30.150
It's just seven-six
and six-five suited.

00:37:30.150 --> 00:37:33.134
OK, so seven-six suited,
how many combinations?

00:37:33.134 --> 00:37:34.090
AUDIENCE: Two?

00:37:34.090 --> 00:37:34.970
WILL MA: Two.

00:37:34.970 --> 00:37:37.760
Six-five suited, three?

00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:40.107
OK.

00:37:40.107 --> 00:37:40.940
Did I miss anything?

00:37:40.940 --> 00:37:42.710
I think this is it, right?

00:37:42.710 --> 00:37:45.440
OK, so basically we
have to tally it up.

00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:46.955
So here, there's 14.

00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:52.500
Here, there's 23.

00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:53.470
And here, there's five.

00:37:56.870 --> 00:38:03.547
OK so now that we've
done this calculation,

00:38:03.547 --> 00:38:05.130
we need to, basically,
run the numbers

00:38:05.130 --> 00:38:06.450
with these calculations.

00:38:06.450 --> 00:38:10.354
So essentially,
roughly speaking,

00:38:10.354 --> 00:38:12.270
they're going to fold
more than half the time.

00:38:17.709 --> 00:38:19.500
So the numbers-- I
think this will actually

00:38:19.500 --> 00:38:21.030
come out close
because with the way

00:38:21.030 --> 00:38:23.860
we did this specific
calculation,

00:38:23.860 --> 00:38:26.220
I think we gave him a lot
of combinations of hands

00:38:26.220 --> 00:38:28.050
that we can actually
check and beat.

00:38:28.050 --> 00:38:30.540
But I think this is still--
this will still definitely

00:38:30.540 --> 00:38:31.620
call for a bluff.

00:38:31.620 --> 00:38:32.489
But it close.

00:38:32.489 --> 00:38:34.530
If you've done the homework,
the homework sort of

00:38:34.530 --> 00:38:35.640
addresses this, right?

00:38:39.700 --> 00:38:42.210
It's not just the probability
he's calling our bluff,

00:38:42.210 --> 00:38:44.400
it's the probability
he's calling

00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:48.020
our bluff versus the probability
we win the hand by checking.

00:38:48.020 --> 00:38:51.975
And the probability we win the
hand by checking is roughly 5

00:38:51.975 --> 00:38:54.500
out of 42--

00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:58.320
so which is pretty small, and he
folds more than half the time.

00:38:58.320 --> 00:38:59.730
So if you run the
numbers, you'll

00:38:59.730 --> 00:39:03.390
see that bluffing is
overwhelmingly profitable.

00:39:03.390 --> 00:39:07.280
And I think this
is a good example

00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:09.670
of why this combinatorial
analysis is good--

00:39:09.670 --> 00:39:12.450
is because if you
look at PokerStove

00:39:12.450 --> 00:39:15.880
and you look at this,
you might actually think

00:39:15.880 --> 00:39:19.150
bluffing is bad because you
look at most of the hands--

00:39:19.150 --> 00:39:22.120
ace-king, ace-jack,
ace-nine, 10-8, 10-6, 8-6--

00:39:22.120 --> 00:39:25.680
it's hands that
call us and beat us,

00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:28.080
but when you do this
combinatorial analysis,

00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:31.460
you'll realize there's way
more combinations of queen-jack

00:39:31.460 --> 00:39:33.270
than there are eight-six.

00:39:33.270 --> 00:39:35.460
So looking at this
itself isn't quite enough

00:39:35.460 --> 00:39:38.070
because this doesn't weight
the probabilities of each one

00:39:38.070 --> 00:39:40.460
correctly.

00:39:40.460 --> 00:39:43.410
So this is a good
exercise to do, I think.

00:39:43.410 --> 00:39:45.750
Even though we made a lot
of assumptions in our model,

00:39:45.750 --> 00:39:50.040
but it's a very good
exercise to do after the fact

00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:52.740
to sort of just analyze
what are the different-- all

00:39:52.740 --> 00:39:55.035
the different possibilities.

00:39:55.035 --> 00:39:57.250
OK, so I'm going to
take a quick break here.

00:39:57.250 --> 00:39:59.640
And then for the last
half of the class,

00:39:59.640 --> 00:40:03.180
I'm going to just talk about
some general poker topics.

00:40:03.180 --> 00:40:04.110
So no math.

00:40:04.110 --> 00:40:05.880
No poker hands.

00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:08.200
But just some general stuff
about poker and some ending

00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:10.590
remarks since this
is the last time

00:40:10.590 --> 00:40:12.914
I'm teaching since Bill
Chen is coming next time.

00:40:12.914 --> 00:40:15.330
If you want to, during the
break, think about any question

00:40:15.330 --> 00:40:17.560
you might want to ask me
about poker in general--

00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:19.890
or specific-- and--

00:40:19.890 --> 00:40:22.287
yeah-- so we'll take
like a 10-minute break.

00:40:22.287 --> 00:40:23.745
Make sure you hand
in the homework.

00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:28.770
All right, so I'm
going to wrap up

00:40:28.770 --> 00:40:32.130
with some general thoughts about
poker and poker in general.

00:40:32.130 --> 00:40:35.190
So one question that
I get asked a lot

00:40:35.190 --> 00:40:37.320
is, it's called the
Moneymaker effect.

00:40:37.320 --> 00:40:39.540
So what happened-- and this
is sort of a big catalyst

00:40:39.540 --> 00:40:41.010
for poker becoming
really popular--

00:40:41.010 --> 00:40:44.450
was, I think in 2003,
Chris Moneymaker,

00:40:44.450 --> 00:40:45.630
that's actually his name--

00:40:45.630 --> 00:40:48.480
Moneymaker is his last name--

00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:51.650
he spent like $1 playing in
this satellite on PokerStars,

00:40:51.650 --> 00:40:54.179
won a seat to the World
Series of Poker main event,

00:40:54.179 --> 00:40:56.220
and then went there, and
then won the whole thing

00:40:56.220 --> 00:40:58.460
for like $2.5 million.

00:40:58.460 --> 00:41:00.136
It was a beautiful
Cinderella story,

00:41:00.136 --> 00:41:01.260
and then people heard this.

00:41:01.260 --> 00:41:02.730
And also, they made it
seem like, you know,

00:41:02.730 --> 00:41:04.520
it's not like the lottery
where you've got to get really,

00:41:04.520 --> 00:41:05.686
really lucky to become rich.

00:41:05.686 --> 00:41:07.730
It's literally, this
guy's really smart.

00:41:07.730 --> 00:41:10.420
He can read people,
and it's all skill.

00:41:10.420 --> 00:41:11.280
And he did this.

00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:13.890
And it's sort of like, anyone
can become a poker star just

00:41:13.890 --> 00:41:16.380
like Chris Moneymaker.

00:41:16.380 --> 00:41:19.510
And this was a
huge driving force

00:41:19.510 --> 00:41:22.360
in the popularity of poker.

00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:25.260
So a question that I
wondered myself is,

00:41:25.260 --> 00:41:27.305
how could there actually
be so much money?

00:41:27.305 --> 00:41:29.430
Because someone has to be
losing this money for you

00:41:29.430 --> 00:41:31.370
to be winning this money, right?

00:41:31.370 --> 00:41:34.770
So where is the
money coming from?

00:41:34.770 --> 00:41:37.940
Can anyone smart and
motivated succeed in poker?

00:41:37.940 --> 00:41:40.650
Et cetera.

00:41:40.650 --> 00:41:43.581
OK, so what's
unique about poker?

00:41:43.581 --> 00:41:45.330
Why can't you make
this much money playing

00:41:45.330 --> 00:41:47.280
like chess or something?

00:41:47.280 --> 00:41:50.110
Why can't you make this
much money playing hockey?

00:41:50.110 --> 00:41:51.630
So what's unique about poker?

00:41:51.630 --> 00:41:53.470
So I guess four unique
aspects that allows

00:41:53.470 --> 00:41:54.720
for there to be so much money.

00:41:54.720 --> 00:41:56.740
So I'm going to talk
about them individually.

00:41:56.740 --> 00:42:00.205
One is, I think everyone is
overconfident, myself included.

00:42:00.205 --> 00:42:04.050
Two is, gambling
self-control-- aspects of that.

00:42:04.050 --> 00:42:06.570
Three is, it's a very
fast-evolving game.

00:42:06.570 --> 00:42:08.760
And four is, what I sort
of started the class--

00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:12.650
the very first class I talked
about being credit card

00:42:12.650 --> 00:42:14.750
roulette-- not being
results-oriented.

00:42:14.750 --> 00:42:15.990
And I think that's very hard.

00:42:15.990 --> 00:42:19.770
So I'll go through each
one of them separately.

00:42:19.770 --> 00:42:22.100
So yeah, one is this huge
overconfidence thing,

00:42:22.100 --> 00:42:23.100
which is very prevalent.

00:42:23.100 --> 00:42:26.910
So it's normal, in general,
for people to be overconfident.

00:42:26.910 --> 00:42:30.150
I don't know how many of you
have seen the experiment where

00:42:30.150 --> 00:42:33.090
it's like, you know, write
down your 95% confidence

00:42:33.090 --> 00:42:35.000
intervals for all these things.

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:37.380
So if they're actually
95% confidence intervals

00:42:37.380 --> 00:42:39.180
and they're
correctly calibrated,

00:42:39.180 --> 00:42:41.790
then actually 19 out
of 20 of your intervals

00:42:41.790 --> 00:42:43.530
should contain the real thing.

00:42:43.530 --> 00:42:45.270
But like you do this
for a normal person,

00:42:45.270 --> 00:42:48.990
it'll be like, 30% of their
things actually lie neutral.

00:42:48.990 --> 00:42:52.640
So they're just
drastically overconfident.

00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:55.530
And so yeah, it's normal to be
overconfident, but especially

00:42:55.530 --> 00:42:56.586
in poker.

00:42:56.586 --> 00:42:57.960
I think poker is
among the things

00:42:57.960 --> 00:43:00.210
I know where it's
easiest to overestimate

00:43:00.210 --> 00:43:02.000
your own abilities.

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:04.110
Does someone want to
suggest any others?

00:43:04.110 --> 00:43:06.209
Is there something else
you think where like,

00:43:06.209 --> 00:43:08.000
everyone thinks they're
good at this thing?

00:43:12.200 --> 00:43:17.480
So I can think of two examples
that I think are sort of true.

00:43:17.480 --> 00:43:21.335
Raise your hand if you think
you're a below medium driver.

00:43:23.932 --> 00:43:26.015
No, but some people actually
are willing to do it.

00:43:26.015 --> 00:43:28.400
Because I very rarely talk
to someone who admitted

00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:29.677
to being bad at driving.

00:43:29.677 --> 00:43:31.760
Everyone I've ever asked
about their driving skill

00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:34.490
thinks they're really good at
driving a car, myself included.

00:43:34.490 --> 00:43:37.577
I definitely don't think
I'm a below medium driver.

00:43:37.577 --> 00:43:38.660
Another thing is teaching.

00:43:38.660 --> 00:43:41.360
I've also barely
talked to someone

00:43:41.360 --> 00:43:44.090
who thinks they're worse
than medium at teaching.

00:43:47.032 --> 00:43:48.490
I guess maybe
Professor [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:48.490 --> 00:43:49.840
can speak about this.

00:43:54.900 --> 00:43:57.820
Most things someone will
admit to being bad at this,

00:43:57.820 --> 00:44:02.340
but poker is similar to these
two examples I thought of--

00:44:02.340 --> 00:44:03.560
driving, teaching, sort of.

00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:06.120
Where it's just very easy to
think you're really good at it,

00:44:06.120 --> 00:44:09.270
and it's hard to admit to
yourself that you're not

00:44:09.270 --> 00:44:10.270
good at it.

00:44:10.270 --> 00:44:13.770
Yeah, so one saying in poker
is, if you can't spot the fish

00:44:13.770 --> 00:44:17.190
at the table-- the fish is like
the losing player that everyone

00:44:17.190 --> 00:44:18.530
is trying to win money from--

00:44:18.530 --> 00:44:20.520
then you are the fish.

00:44:20.520 --> 00:44:23.210
This is sort of
a popular saying.

00:44:23.210 --> 00:44:26.355
So why is overconfidence
so common in poker?

00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:30.720
It's like a mental battle.

00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:33.330
Your mentally battling
against your opponent.

00:44:33.330 --> 00:44:34.110
Is he bluffing?

00:44:34.110 --> 00:44:34.950
Is he not?

00:44:34.950 --> 00:44:36.900
And it's just easy
to always assume--

00:44:36.900 --> 00:44:40.409
which I do throughout a
lot of this class, right?

00:44:40.409 --> 00:44:41.700
I talk about exploitative play.

00:44:41.700 --> 00:44:43.670
I'm building a model
for our opponent

00:44:43.670 --> 00:44:47.070
and assuming that they behave
as a probabilistic machine

00:44:47.070 --> 00:44:48.330
according to my model.

00:44:48.330 --> 00:44:50.250
I'm assuming that I'm
ahead of my opponent.

00:44:50.250 --> 00:44:52.032
I'm assuming I'm better.

00:44:52.032 --> 00:44:54.150
There's also a lot of
selective memory, I think.

00:44:54.150 --> 00:44:56.100
It's easy to remember
your bad beats--

00:44:56.100 --> 00:44:59.590
the time they hit a king on
the river and beat your aces--

00:44:59.590 --> 00:45:02.730
and it's easy to forget the
times you got really lucky

00:45:02.730 --> 00:45:04.170
on the river and beat them.

00:45:04.170 --> 00:45:08.250
So selective memory, I
think, is a big aspect.

00:45:08.250 --> 00:45:11.410
I think lack of clear benchmarks
is a big aspect as well.

00:45:11.410 --> 00:45:13.740
So it's not like
running 100 meters.

00:45:13.740 --> 00:45:16.300
No one who takes 30
seconds to run 100 meters

00:45:16.300 --> 00:45:19.410
is going to think, oh, I can
compete in the Olympics, right?

00:45:19.410 --> 00:45:20.410
Because it's very clear.

00:45:20.410 --> 00:45:23.210
There's a very clear benchmark
how fast you need to be.

00:45:23.210 --> 00:45:26.700
But in poker, even if you
don't win tournaments,

00:45:26.700 --> 00:45:28.800
it's easy to
complain about luck.

00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:30.780
And there's different
types of tournaments.

00:45:30.780 --> 00:45:33.570
And it's easy to like bend
the benchmarks in a way

00:45:33.570 --> 00:45:36.910
to convince yourself that
you're better than you are.

00:45:36.910 --> 00:45:39.690
It's easy to hit a lucky streak
and consider it all skill,

00:45:39.690 --> 00:45:42.150
and you can blame all your
losing streaks on luck.

00:45:42.150 --> 00:45:43.740
So those are some
reasons I think.

00:45:43.740 --> 00:45:46.020
I think poker is just a
very well-designed game

00:45:46.020 --> 00:45:48.030
for this purpose
and to, basically,

00:45:48.030 --> 00:45:50.730
tricking and deceiving
people into overestimating

00:45:50.730 --> 00:45:53.880
their own ability.

00:45:53.880 --> 00:45:56.460
And another aspect
of it is, and this

00:45:56.460 --> 00:45:58.720
is what's really tough
poker, I think, is,

00:45:58.720 --> 00:46:01.240
even though it's so easy
to be overconfident,

00:46:01.240 --> 00:46:03.780
and it's such a flaw to be
overconfident, it's also,

00:46:03.780 --> 00:46:04.950
in some sense, necessary.

00:46:04.950 --> 00:46:06.750
You know, if you're
not confident,

00:46:06.750 --> 00:46:08.190
how can you take risks?

00:46:08.190 --> 00:46:11.000
Poker-- you're
gambling, essentially,

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:13.200
and you have to do risky things.

00:46:13.200 --> 00:46:16.650
And if you're not confident, how
can you do risky things, right?

00:46:16.650 --> 00:46:20.460
And also, if you're trying to
mentally read your opponent,

00:46:20.460 --> 00:46:21.960
if you're constantly
remind yourself

00:46:21.960 --> 00:46:24.720
that you're dumber than you
think you are, then how can

00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:28.980
you actually think that you
can outread your opponent?

00:46:28.980 --> 00:46:30.750
And I talked about
this results-oriented.

00:46:30.750 --> 00:46:32.310
You need to be
confident to trust

00:46:32.310 --> 00:46:35.310
that you made a good decision
even though your result was

00:46:35.310 --> 00:46:37.600
you lost $10,000 on the day.

00:46:37.600 --> 00:46:41.820
So confidence is also
necessary, but it's also so easy

00:46:41.820 --> 00:46:42.860
to be overconfident.

00:46:42.860 --> 00:46:46.470
So this balance of being
exactly the right confidence

00:46:46.470 --> 00:46:50.010
is something that I think
even like professional poker

00:46:50.010 --> 00:46:53.464
players strive to try to strike
the balance between every day.

00:46:53.464 --> 00:46:54.630
And I think it's very tough.

00:46:54.630 --> 00:46:55.980
And it's something I
struggle with a lot,

00:46:55.980 --> 00:46:58.485
too, to try to figure out
when I'm being overconfident

00:46:58.485 --> 00:47:02.470
and when I'm being
underconfident.

00:47:02.470 --> 00:47:05.580
So I think one good mentality--
so back to this driving thing

00:47:05.580 --> 00:47:09.300
is, I think it's a good
mentality-- you know,

00:47:09.300 --> 00:47:10.800
if you play poker
and you enjoy it.

00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:11.950
I think it's a great game.

00:47:11.950 --> 00:47:14.340
It's a beautiful mathematical
game and a fun game

00:47:14.340 --> 00:47:17.010
to play with friends
if you're just

00:47:17.010 --> 00:47:19.350
are willing to admit, you
know, I play in this home game

00:47:19.350 --> 00:47:20.150
every Friday night.

00:47:20.150 --> 00:47:23.190
I'm probably a below
average player.

00:47:23.190 --> 00:47:25.744
I probably lose, on average,
$10 every time I play.

00:47:25.744 --> 00:47:26.910
I think that's totally fine.

00:47:26.910 --> 00:47:28.368
It's just like
spending your Friday

00:47:28.368 --> 00:47:29.760
night going to see a movie.

00:47:29.760 --> 00:47:33.990
You pay $10 and you're happy
to take $10 out of your wallet

00:47:33.990 --> 00:47:37.590
and not see it again, right?

00:47:37.590 --> 00:47:40.740
I think it would be a healthy
mentality for more people

00:47:40.740 --> 00:47:43.579
to be willing to do this and
just admit to themselves,

00:47:43.579 --> 00:47:45.870
yeah, I enjoy playing poker,
and I lose a bit of money,

00:47:45.870 --> 00:47:47.470
but you know, I
have fun doing it.

00:47:47.470 --> 00:47:49.410
And it's the same
as seeing a movie

00:47:49.410 --> 00:47:52.640
but, in reality, I think
this isn't the case.

00:47:52.640 --> 00:47:56.280
Even at these friendly Friday
night games for low stakes,

00:47:56.280 --> 00:47:58.260
probably, if you ask
all the people there,

00:47:58.260 --> 00:48:00.060
do you think you're
beating your friends?

00:48:00.060 --> 00:48:01.350
Everyone's going to say yes.

00:48:01.350 --> 00:48:05.250
Everyone's not saying, oh,
I'm going there, essentially,

00:48:05.250 --> 00:48:07.410
paying $10 to play
poker with my friends.

00:48:07.410 --> 00:48:10.020
Everyone's saying, I'm winning
a bit of money or whatever,

00:48:10.020 --> 00:48:10.520
right?

00:48:10.520 --> 00:48:16.440
So I think that's an important
mentality to try to have that.

00:48:16.440 --> 00:48:18.645
And I think it's fine.

00:48:18.645 --> 00:48:22.320
You don't have to be the
best at everything, right?

00:48:22.320 --> 00:48:25.306
So one story I like to
tell is, so David Einhorn--

00:48:25.306 --> 00:48:26.305
he's like a billionaire.

00:48:26.305 --> 00:48:29.460
I think he founded Greenlight
Capital or something.

00:48:29.460 --> 00:48:33.340
And he actually won $4
million in a $1 million

00:48:33.340 --> 00:48:37.170
buy-in poker tournament and
donated it all to charity.

00:48:37.170 --> 00:48:39.240
And after the fact--

00:48:39.240 --> 00:48:41.520
he's always like a
super smart guy--

00:48:41.520 --> 00:48:43.860
so he played a $1 million
buy-in tournament.

00:48:43.860 --> 00:48:46.850
So everyone else playing this
tournament is like a poker

00:48:46.850 --> 00:48:48.990
professional-- the
best in the world--

00:48:48.990 --> 00:48:52.400
and he's just like this
rich billionaire who

00:48:52.400 --> 00:48:53.960
doesn't really--
like he wasn't bad,

00:48:53.960 --> 00:48:56.750
but he just started
playing poker.

00:48:56.750 --> 00:48:59.730
Like, he's a smart guy, and
he got coaching to play it,

00:48:59.730 --> 00:49:02.930
but he was the clear
loser in the tournament.

00:49:02.930 --> 00:49:03.930
And he just admitted it.

00:49:03.930 --> 00:49:05.638
He just said you know,
I'm a billionaire.

00:49:05.638 --> 00:49:07.250
I'm happy to spend
a million dollars

00:49:07.250 --> 00:49:08.330
playing this tournament.

00:49:08.330 --> 00:49:12.077
I understand I'm probably
expecting to lose like $200,000

00:49:12.077 --> 00:49:14.410
or whatever playing this
tournament with all these guys,

00:49:14.410 --> 00:49:15.330
but I'm fine with it.

00:49:15.330 --> 00:49:17.514
I got a million dollars,
who cares, right?

00:49:17.514 --> 00:49:18.680
And he was just very honest.

00:49:18.680 --> 00:49:21.070
And even after he
actually won $4 million,

00:49:21.070 --> 00:49:22.820
he didn't come first,
he came like third--

00:49:22.820 --> 00:49:26.010
he just admitted, you know, he
said like, I was very lucky.

00:49:26.010 --> 00:49:28.670
I came in expecting to
just lose this $1 million

00:49:28.670 --> 00:49:30.584
that I don't care
about, and then

00:49:30.584 --> 00:49:32.750
he just donated all his
winnings to charity, anyway.

00:49:32.750 --> 00:49:35.150
But I wish more
people were like him.

00:49:35.150 --> 00:49:37.040
I think that's a
very good mentality

00:49:37.040 --> 00:49:39.800
to have to just admit that
you're playing poker for fun,

00:49:39.800 --> 00:49:43.060
and that's totally fine.

00:49:43.060 --> 00:49:45.060
OK, so the second thing
I want to talk about

00:49:45.060 --> 00:49:47.870
is gambling self-control.

00:49:47.870 --> 00:49:51.290
So I think this can
also be the downfall

00:49:51.290 --> 00:49:53.990
of a lot of smart and
motivated people trying

00:49:53.990 --> 00:49:54.870
to get into poker.

00:49:58.102 --> 00:49:59.810
So these are some
things that can happen.

00:49:59.810 --> 00:50:01.730
So after getting unlucky
in the previous hand,

00:50:01.730 --> 00:50:04.200
you play the next hand
poorly because you're upset.

00:50:04.200 --> 00:50:07.460
You're tilted, as
poker player say.

00:50:07.460 --> 00:50:10.179
Or playing when you're
tired just to get unstuck.

00:50:10.179 --> 00:50:12.470
I've definitely done this
many times before in my poker

00:50:12.470 --> 00:50:13.460
career.

00:50:13.460 --> 00:50:15.470
If I lost money,
especially when I

00:50:15.470 --> 00:50:18.290
feel like I'd gotten unlucky
playing against someone

00:50:18.290 --> 00:50:20.060
who I'm better
than and just like,

00:50:20.060 --> 00:50:22.150
I've lost money
because I got unlucky,

00:50:22.150 --> 00:50:26.240
I won't stop playing until I
get unstuck, which is like,

00:50:26.240 --> 00:50:29.270
win back the money I lost until
I'm in the black, essentially.

00:50:29.270 --> 00:50:32.922
And it's terrible because
even if I'm a bit better,

00:50:32.922 --> 00:50:34.630
if I'm playing with
this mentality trying

00:50:34.630 --> 00:50:36.900
to get unstuck, I'm
just going to be making

00:50:36.900 --> 00:50:40.020
below average decisions, and
it's just not a good thing

00:50:40.020 --> 00:50:42.330
to do.

00:50:42.330 --> 00:50:44.640
And also from the
other side, it can be

00:50:44.640 --> 00:50:46.370
hard to rationalize gambling.

00:50:46.370 --> 00:50:48.830
So it's hard to stop yourself
from gambling too much,

00:50:48.830 --> 00:50:52.520
but it's also sometimes hard
to rationalize that, you know,

00:50:52.520 --> 00:50:54.830
gambling-- there is a lot
of stigma around gambling.

00:50:54.830 --> 00:50:57.740
You have to convince
yourself that, I

00:50:57.740 --> 00:50:59.172
shouldn't be too scared.

00:50:59.172 --> 00:51:01.130
I'm playing this game
that involves-- you know,

00:51:01.130 --> 00:51:02.150
you can call it gambling--

00:51:02.150 --> 00:51:03.890
I'm playing this game
with a lot of luck.

00:51:03.890 --> 00:51:05.914
And you've got to convince
yourself that, this

00:51:05.914 --> 00:51:07.080
is what I'm fine with doing.

00:51:07.080 --> 00:51:08.240
It's like a lottery.

00:51:08.240 --> 00:51:10.280
And you've got to
sometimes make decisions

00:51:10.280 --> 00:51:11.540
under pressure as well.

00:51:11.540 --> 00:51:13.456
And you've just got to
rationalize to yourself

00:51:13.456 --> 00:51:15.389
that, yeah, there's a
lot of luck in this,

00:51:15.389 --> 00:51:16.930
but this is the game
I chose to play.

00:51:21.020 --> 00:51:22.595
The third thing is--

00:51:22.595 --> 00:51:26.450
so fast evolution, I think,
is another big aspect

00:51:26.450 --> 00:51:31.550
of how there was so much money
in Texas hold 'em for so long.

00:51:31.550 --> 00:51:34.490
So it was a relatively
new game, also

00:51:34.490 --> 00:51:36.020
with a lot of hidden depth.

00:51:36.020 --> 00:51:38.060
So something like
this can never happen

00:51:38.060 --> 00:51:40.440
in chess, where chess
has been studied

00:51:40.440 --> 00:51:42.620
for hundreds,
thousands of years,

00:51:42.620 --> 00:51:44.600
and it's not like a new game.

00:51:44.600 --> 00:51:47.450
And even though the best player
today is still better than

00:51:47.450 --> 00:51:50.610
the best player 20 years ago,
it's not like the game is

00:51:50.610 --> 00:51:55.110
evolving super fast, whereas
hold 'em was like a new game--

00:51:55.110 --> 00:51:57.110
a relatively new
game at the time.

00:51:57.110 --> 00:51:59.960
And just-- there was
so much hidden depth,

00:51:59.960 --> 00:52:03.409
and the best players just
kept improving so fast that--

00:52:03.409 --> 00:52:05.450
so like you say, like the
best player in the year

00:52:05.450 --> 00:52:09.380
2000 would be like a
terrible player by 2004.

00:52:09.380 --> 00:52:12.640
And like the best player in
2004 would be a bad player

00:52:12.640 --> 00:52:13.910
by 2008, et cetera.

00:52:13.910 --> 00:52:16.580
So it's just, even if
you're on top of the game

00:52:16.580 --> 00:52:18.680
right now, if you
stop studying, you're

00:52:18.680 --> 00:52:21.560
going to be nowhere near the
top of the game in like a year.

00:52:21.560 --> 00:52:23.010
So it was just so fast.

00:52:23.010 --> 00:52:25.640
Can anyone else think of
other examples of things

00:52:25.640 --> 00:52:28.106
that are kind of like this?

00:52:28.106 --> 00:52:32.420
AUDIENCE: CrossFit was--
well, if you get like--

00:52:32.420 --> 00:52:37.280
the winner of the 2009-2010
games wouldn't even compete.

00:52:37.280 --> 00:52:38.370
WILL MA: Oh, wow.

00:52:38.370 --> 00:52:39.430
OK I didn't know that.

00:52:39.430 --> 00:52:40.400
That's cool.

00:52:40.400 --> 00:52:43.574
I didn't know CrossFit
was that good, yeah.

00:52:43.574 --> 00:52:46.730
That's pretty crazy.

00:52:46.730 --> 00:52:49.910
There's one other thing
I can sort of think of.

00:52:49.910 --> 00:52:53.000
How many you guys have done
math contests as a kid?

00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:56.384
I think those, to my knowledge,
have gotten a lot harder,

00:52:56.384 --> 00:52:57.800
just in terms of
how good you need

00:52:57.800 --> 00:53:00.560
to be to say, be on the
United States national team

00:53:00.560 --> 00:53:04.060
is way harder now than it was,
say, 30 years ago from what

00:53:04.060 --> 00:53:06.485
I've heard.

00:53:06.485 --> 00:53:08.500
But yeah, so this
aspect of Texas hold

00:53:08.500 --> 00:53:10.730
'em-- so this was also
a huge driving factor.

00:53:10.730 --> 00:53:14.570
Because it would be
easy to tell yourself,

00:53:14.570 --> 00:53:16.920
I was the best player in
the world four years ago.

00:53:16.920 --> 00:53:20.400
I could obviously sit down at
this $1/$2 game and make money,

00:53:20.400 --> 00:53:20.900
right?

00:53:20.900 --> 00:53:22.670
And the answer
would often be, no.

00:53:22.670 --> 00:53:26.600
So this was another reason why
there was a lot of money in it.

00:53:26.600 --> 00:53:29.630
Because it's easy
to just remember

00:53:29.630 --> 00:53:31.490
that you were the best
a year ago and just

00:53:31.490 --> 00:53:36.760
forget that the tides
are rising so fast.

00:53:36.760 --> 00:53:39.800
So that being said, so I wanted
to also take this opportunity

00:53:39.800 --> 00:53:41.574
to suggest some
further readings for--

00:53:41.574 --> 00:53:42.740
I know I've been asked this.

00:53:42.740 --> 00:53:43.000
Yeah?

00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:44.270
AUDIENCE: So why is that?

00:53:44.270 --> 00:53:45.670
Based on your understanding?

00:53:45.670 --> 00:53:49.790
I think because of
your strategies--

00:53:49.790 --> 00:53:51.266
you have to improve
your strategy?

00:53:51.266 --> 00:53:52.640
WILL MA: Yeah,
yeah, I also think

00:53:52.640 --> 00:53:54.930
there was a lot of hidden depth.

00:53:54.930 --> 00:53:59.040
So I mean, I think with any new
thing, this will be the case.

00:53:59.040 --> 00:54:01.940
But I think in poker,
there were many times

00:54:01.940 --> 00:54:05.930
where the consensus amongst
the top players was that they

00:54:05.930 --> 00:54:08.065
were close to solving the game.

00:54:08.065 --> 00:54:09.440
And then a year
later, they would

00:54:09.440 --> 00:54:13.607
realize they missed completely
viable strategies that

00:54:13.607 --> 00:54:15.440
completely messed up
all their calculations,

00:54:15.440 --> 00:54:17.220
and they had to start over.

00:54:17.220 --> 00:54:19.700
So I think that was big.

00:54:19.700 --> 00:54:22.184
It's easy to think that
you've solved the game

00:54:22.184 --> 00:54:23.600
and then suddenly
realize, oh, I'm

00:54:23.600 --> 00:54:25.955
nowhere near solving the game
because I forgot about all

00:54:25.955 --> 00:54:28.108
of these different strategies.

00:54:30.680 --> 00:54:33.762
This might be sort of
true with a lot of--

00:54:33.762 --> 00:54:34.970
I'm trying to think, I mean--

00:54:34.970 --> 00:54:36.950
the biggest thing
is, it's a new thing.

00:54:36.950 --> 00:54:38.990
Like it's hard for
this to happen like--

00:54:38.990 --> 00:54:41.330
I think in most
sports that people

00:54:41.330 --> 00:54:43.910
have done for a long time,
people get gradually better,

00:54:43.910 --> 00:54:44.600
right?

00:54:44.600 --> 00:54:46.574
You look at like,
the 100-meter sprint.

00:54:46.574 --> 00:54:48.740
It's like, yeah, the world
record is getting broken,

00:54:48.740 --> 00:54:50.960
but it's not like it's
going to go from 10 seconds

00:54:50.960 --> 00:54:52.260
to five seconds.

00:54:52.260 --> 00:54:57.860
It'll go from 10 seconds to 9.99
seconds or something like that.

00:54:57.860 --> 00:55:02.504
So I think just the fact that
it's new is a big aspect.

00:55:02.504 --> 00:55:05.630
But yeah, Texas hold 'em would
be the equivalent to the world

00:55:05.630 --> 00:55:08.090
record in the 100 meters
being 10 seconds then

00:55:08.090 --> 00:55:09.670
like five seconds
a year later, then

00:55:09.670 --> 00:55:14.270
like two seconds like two years
later, it was just insane.

00:55:14.270 --> 00:55:16.790
OK, so that being said, so
some people have asked me,

00:55:16.790 --> 00:55:20.840
if I want to continue learning
about poker and reading poker,

00:55:20.840 --> 00:55:21.950
what should I do?

00:55:21.950 --> 00:55:25.455
So that being said, I think
the best resources, by far,

00:55:25.455 --> 00:55:27.280
are online.

00:55:27.280 --> 00:55:29.030
A lot of people have
asked me about books,

00:55:29.030 --> 00:55:33.560
and I will recommend some books,
but I think books, basically,

00:55:33.560 --> 00:55:35.190
blew out of date way too fast.

00:55:35.190 --> 00:55:38.540
So I think, in general, the
best resources are online.

00:55:38.540 --> 00:55:42.530
So cardrunners.com is a website
where, basically, poker pros

00:55:42.530 --> 00:55:46.752
can make videos of themselves
while playing and talking.

00:55:46.752 --> 00:55:48.460
You do have to pay to
get a subscription.

00:55:48.460 --> 00:55:52.970
OK, so this is a bit of a
biased advice, just a warning,

00:55:52.970 --> 00:55:54.810
because I'm a pro
at CardRunners,

00:55:54.810 --> 00:55:58.050
but, I mean, amongst
like 50, 60 other pros.

00:55:58.050 --> 00:55:59.930
They also donated
some free memberships

00:55:59.930 --> 00:56:02.570
to students in the class if
you guys looked at the prizes.

00:56:02.570 --> 00:56:06.770
So you can get some free
memberships to CardRunners.

00:56:06.770 --> 00:56:10.040
A good free resource
is Two Plus Two forums.

00:56:10.040 --> 00:56:13.130
I think there's a lot of
garbage on those forums nowadays

00:56:13.130 --> 00:56:16.310
but, still, most of the best
poker players in the world

00:56:16.310 --> 00:56:19.785
still do use those forums and
posts on those forums-- so

00:56:19.785 --> 00:56:20.410
twoplustwo.com.

00:56:20.410 --> 00:56:23.950
There is a lot of
garbage and banter,

00:56:23.950 --> 00:56:25.750
but if you are just
trying to improve,

00:56:25.750 --> 00:56:27.250
there is good content on there.

00:56:27.250 --> 00:56:30.490
You just have to find it.

00:56:30.490 --> 00:56:32.960
So this is a new thing,
but on Twitch streams--

00:56:32.960 --> 00:56:36.370
so Twitch is a website
you can go on to watch,

00:56:36.370 --> 00:56:39.970
essentially, poker
pros play in real time.

00:56:39.970 --> 00:56:42.820
They share their screens and
talk through their hands.

00:56:42.820 --> 00:56:44.620
It's a pretty good
free resource.

00:56:44.620 --> 00:56:47.080
It's sometimes more
entertaining than educational,

00:56:47.080 --> 00:56:48.730
but I think it's quite good.

00:56:48.730 --> 00:56:51.520
And they would do
like a 10-minute delay

00:56:51.520 --> 00:56:54.820
so that you can't watch them and
you know what cards they have.

00:56:54.820 --> 00:56:57.010
In case anyone was
considering trying

00:56:57.010 --> 00:57:00.340
to do that to get an advantage.

00:57:00.340 --> 00:57:02.530
So these are some
online resources,

00:57:02.530 --> 00:57:05.260
and I will suggest
some books, although I

00:57:05.260 --> 00:57:09.010
do think most of these books, I
think, are reasonably outdated.

00:57:09.010 --> 00:57:11.475
But I do think they're
very-- in my opinion,

00:57:11.475 --> 00:57:12.850
out of the books
I've read, these

00:57:12.850 --> 00:57:14.590
are the best-written books.

00:57:14.590 --> 00:57:17.320
And even if they're
a bit outdated,

00:57:17.320 --> 00:57:19.480
I think the theory and
the way they're written

00:57:19.480 --> 00:57:22.000
is very good and also
somewhat entertaining

00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:24.820
and sort of gives you an
idea on the history of poker

00:57:24.820 --> 00:57:27.869
and the evolution of the game.

00:57:27.869 --> 00:57:29.410
So my favorite book
is the first one.

00:57:29.410 --> 00:57:31.200
It's called, Small
Stakes Hold 'em.

00:57:31.200 --> 00:57:35.260
It's by Ed Miller, who's a
MIT graduate; David Sklansky;

00:57:35.260 --> 00:57:36.790
and Mason Malmuth.

00:57:36.790 --> 00:57:38.420
So this is actually
limit hold 'em,

00:57:38.420 --> 00:57:40.970
which is, in some sense,
a solved game nowadays,

00:57:40.970 --> 00:57:43.000
and no one plays limit
hold 'em anymore.

00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:46.630
So limit hold 'em is where
you can't bet any amount.

00:57:46.630 --> 00:57:50.770
You have to bet a
very specific size.

00:57:50.770 --> 00:57:52.796
But I think this is one
of the classic books.

00:57:52.796 --> 00:57:54.670
So this is one of the
classic books in poker.

00:57:54.670 --> 00:57:57.037
It's very well written and
written by mathematicians.

00:57:57.037 --> 00:57:59.245
And it just goes through
the basic concepts of poker,

00:57:59.245 --> 00:58:01.828
I think, very, very well, even
though it's for limit hold 'em.

00:58:01.828 --> 00:58:02.710
And it's a good read.

00:58:05.830 --> 00:58:09.100
Yeah, it might even be a
collector's item nowadays.

00:58:09.100 --> 00:58:11.620
So one story I'd like to
tell about this book is--

00:58:11.620 --> 00:58:14.410
so my good friend,
Mike McDonald, he was--

00:58:14.410 --> 00:58:18.540
so he's the guy who
got me into poker.

00:58:18.540 --> 00:58:20.800
He's probably read this
book, he says like--

00:58:20.800 --> 00:58:22.960
maybe like 20 times.

00:58:22.960 --> 00:58:25.764
And then he's also a guy who
doesn't really like reading.

00:58:25.764 --> 00:58:27.430
So I think there was
a point in his life

00:58:27.430 --> 00:58:31.390
where he's read less than 20
different books in his life

00:58:31.390 --> 00:58:34.990
but then this specific
book more than 20 times.

00:58:34.990 --> 00:58:37.330
So it's a very good book.

00:58:37.330 --> 00:58:39.520
Harrington on Hold
'em is on tournaments.

00:58:39.520 --> 00:58:40.420
It's outdated.

00:58:40.420 --> 00:58:42.070
It's really, really
badly outdated,

00:58:42.070 --> 00:58:44.390
but I still think it's
very well written and has

00:58:44.390 --> 00:58:45.352
some good concepts.

00:58:45.352 --> 00:58:46.810
That's how I first
started learning

00:58:46.810 --> 00:58:50.830
to play tournaments is
Harrington on Hold 'em 1 and 2.

00:58:50.830 --> 00:58:53.620
Kill Phil/ Kill Everyone
I think is pretty good,

00:58:53.620 --> 00:58:54.620
pretty up to date--

00:58:54.620 --> 00:58:56.400
it's decent, I think.

00:58:56.400 --> 00:58:57.970
Every Hand Revealed is--

00:58:57.970 --> 00:58:59.770
Gus Hansen's a very
famous poker player

00:58:59.770 --> 00:59:02.620
who's been around forever.

00:59:02.620 --> 00:59:05.920
So it's a book where he goes
through every hand he played

00:59:05.920 --> 00:59:07.384
in this tournament that he won.

00:59:07.384 --> 00:59:09.550
And I think it's more
entertaining than educational,

00:59:09.550 --> 00:59:12.340
but he's definitely
a really good player.

00:59:12.340 --> 00:59:14.050
Mathematics of
Poker by Bill Chen.

00:59:14.050 --> 00:59:17.240
It's not that practical-- don't
tell Bill this when he comes

00:59:17.240 --> 00:59:18.880
Friday--

00:59:18.880 --> 00:59:22.030
it's theoretically very
interesting if you like math--

00:59:22.030 --> 00:59:23.380
if you like game theory.

00:59:23.380 --> 00:59:25.340
It's theoretically
very interesting.

00:59:25.340 --> 00:59:28.890
Building a Bankroll is
a recent book that--

00:59:28.890 --> 00:59:30.870
this year, he didn't
have any leftovers

00:59:30.870 --> 00:59:33.140
to donate to our class
but, in the past,

00:59:33.140 --> 00:59:36.070
he's supported our
class and donated

00:59:36.070 --> 00:59:37.250
a lot of copies of the book.

00:59:37.250 --> 00:59:42.007
And I think it's pretty up to
date, and it's for cash games,

00:59:42.007 --> 00:59:43.090
so I think it's very good.

00:59:47.290 --> 00:59:50.110
OK, so back to the four things
about poker that I think

00:59:50.110 --> 00:59:52.450
makes it unique.

00:59:52.450 --> 00:59:57.790
So the fourth point is this idea
of not being results-oriented.

00:59:57.790 --> 00:59:59.760
So yeah, so we talked
about this a lot

00:59:59.760 --> 01:00:04.090
in the first class already--
this decision mentality, where

01:00:04.090 --> 01:00:06.610
you need to care about
the decision you made,

01:00:06.610 --> 01:00:08.080
not the result you got.

01:00:08.080 --> 01:00:11.020
And I think this
actually is a barrier

01:00:11.020 --> 01:00:14.210
to a lot of smart and
motivated people getting

01:00:14.210 --> 01:00:18.910
into poker because it's
almost antithetical.

01:00:18.910 --> 01:00:21.810
If you're a smart and motivated
person, you're used to like--

01:00:21.810 --> 01:00:25.180
you study hard, and then you
get a good result on your tests,

01:00:25.180 --> 01:00:27.090
right?

01:00:27.090 --> 01:00:29.711
If you get a failing
grade in your test,

01:00:29.711 --> 01:00:31.960
you're never going to be
able to go up to your parents

01:00:31.960 --> 01:00:34.145
and be like, oh, I
make good decisions,

01:00:34.145 --> 01:00:36.520
but I just got really unlucky
and failed the test, right?

01:00:36.520 --> 01:00:37.769
No one's going to believe you.

01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:43.360
In poker, this can
happen all the time.

01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:48.514
So it is a bit antithetical
to sort of being motivated.

01:00:48.514 --> 01:00:50.180
One thing poker players
like to laugh at

01:00:50.180 --> 01:00:54.190
is, I don't know if you put
the word, results-oriented

01:00:54.190 --> 01:00:56.650
on your resume?

01:00:56.650 --> 01:00:59.080
I've seen seminars that
teach you to become

01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:01.630
"results-oriented," and
advertising this as being

01:01:01.630 --> 01:01:03.070
a great thing.

01:01:03.070 --> 01:01:04.630
You achieve results.

01:01:04.630 --> 01:01:07.870
You work hard, make decisions,
and you achieve results.

01:01:07.870 --> 01:01:09.670
But we always laugh at this.

01:01:09.670 --> 01:01:11.140
Because results-oriented
is always

01:01:11.140 --> 01:01:12.910
a negative term in poker.

01:01:12.910 --> 01:01:16.060
If a poker player says
someone is results-oriented,

01:01:16.060 --> 01:01:17.960
they don't respect
them very much.

01:01:17.960 --> 01:01:20.510
But I've seen resume's
where people say,

01:01:20.510 --> 01:01:22.300
I'm very results-oriented.

01:01:28.340 --> 01:01:31.820
So a related thing is,
it's easy to underestimate

01:01:31.820 --> 01:01:33.620
the variance in poker.

01:01:33.620 --> 01:01:36.860
And this is a big
aspect, too, that goes on

01:01:36.860 --> 01:01:39.080
with being results-oriented.

01:01:39.080 --> 01:01:42.560
So this statistical
experiment involving making up

01:01:42.560 --> 01:01:44.390
sequences of coin flips--

01:01:44.390 --> 01:01:47.350
I've heard of this
where a professor would

01:01:47.350 --> 01:01:50.910
ask students to make up a
sequence of 200 coin flips.

01:01:50.910 --> 01:01:53.160
Can we get half the
class to do this?

01:01:53.160 --> 01:01:57.220
And then can we get the other
half to actually flip 200 coins

01:01:57.220 --> 01:01:59.470
and write down like heads,
tails, heads, heads, heads,

01:01:59.470 --> 01:02:01.130
tails?

01:02:01.130 --> 01:02:04.190
And he could tell with
like 100% certainty

01:02:04.190 --> 01:02:06.830
which ones are made up
and which ones were real.

01:02:06.830 --> 01:02:08.750
And the way he did
this is basically

01:02:08.750 --> 01:02:11.050
looking at which of the--

01:02:11.050 --> 01:02:13.280
what's the longest
sequence of heads in a row

01:02:13.280 --> 01:02:14.660
or tails in a row?

01:02:14.660 --> 01:02:18.050
And basically, in reality,
if you flipped 200 coins--

01:02:18.050 --> 01:02:19.490
I forget the exact
numbers, but I

01:02:19.490 --> 01:02:22.280
think it's something
like, you're like 99%

01:02:22.280 --> 01:02:25.760
to get at least like six
or seven of the same thing

01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:28.790
in a row, whereas in
all the made-up ones

01:02:28.790 --> 01:02:30.990
that people would be like,
oh if there was heads

01:02:30.990 --> 01:02:33.290
seven times in a row, that
can't be random, right?

01:02:33.290 --> 01:02:36.870
So we can't put
seven hands in a row.

01:02:36.870 --> 01:02:40.730
So I think it's known that
it's easy to underestimate

01:02:40.730 --> 01:02:43.190
how long you can get
unlucky looking for.

01:02:43.190 --> 01:02:45.950
Like it's easy to think, I've
been unlucky the last three

01:02:45.950 --> 01:02:48.730
times; that means I must
deserve to get lucky now.

01:02:48.730 --> 01:02:51.890
But this is not
true, mathematically.

01:02:51.890 --> 01:02:55.510
And it's just very
easy to underestimate

01:02:55.510 --> 01:02:58.820
variance and underestimate
how likely it

01:02:58.820 --> 01:03:01.340
is that you're just actually
going to lose 10 coin

01:03:01.340 --> 01:03:02.360
flips in a row in poker.

01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:06.410
It's going to happen to you,
and you're going to get tilted.

01:03:06.410 --> 01:03:08.940
And it's very important
to control tilt.

01:03:08.940 --> 01:03:11.120
And yeah, pretty much
every poker player

01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:14.270
thinks they're unluckier
than mathematically possible.

01:03:14.270 --> 01:03:17.390
I've definitely felt like this
in many parts of my career.

01:03:17.390 --> 01:03:19.940
I still feel like
this sometimes now.

01:03:19.940 --> 01:03:22.160
It's very easy to get this
feeling where you just,

01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:23.490
how can it be possible?

01:03:23.490 --> 01:03:25.710
How could I actually lose
20 coin flips in a row?

01:03:25.710 --> 01:03:27.750
Well, it can happen.

01:03:27.750 --> 01:03:32.174
And one of my poker players that
I was talking to, John Cannon,

01:03:32.174 --> 01:03:34.340
he plays a lot of online
poker, and this is actually

01:03:34.340 --> 01:03:36.450
a picture of his desk.

01:03:36.450 --> 01:03:39.500
He, basically, was so angry
I think he smashed his mouse

01:03:39.500 --> 01:03:41.260
and made a big hole in his desk.

01:03:41.260 --> 01:03:43.670
So it can really frustrate you.

01:03:48.440 --> 01:03:49.955
And I hate to say
this, but I think

01:03:49.955 --> 01:03:53.400
even if you're
working very hard, you

01:03:53.400 --> 01:03:55.696
do need some lucky big
scores along the way,

01:03:55.696 --> 01:03:57.320
especially at the
start to get into it,

01:03:57.320 --> 01:03:59.840
even if you're very smart
and working in the right way.

01:03:59.840 --> 01:04:02.587
And this is also
antithetical and smart.

01:04:02.587 --> 01:04:04.670
Antithetical to smart and
motivated people, right?

01:04:04.670 --> 01:04:08.030
Because we want to believe
that if you work hard

01:04:08.030 --> 01:04:10.400
and you're smart, then
you'll make it for sure.

01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:13.580
But I wouldn't say
this is true in poker.

01:04:13.580 --> 01:04:15.830
I mean, I think I'm willing
to admit that I think

01:04:15.830 --> 01:04:18.140
I was very lucky at the start.

01:04:18.140 --> 01:04:20.120
I had some big scores
at the start that

01:04:20.120 --> 01:04:21.950
really drove my
interest in the game

01:04:21.950 --> 01:04:25.280
and really propelled me
into professional poker.

01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:28.510
And I think there probably,
in a parallel universe,

01:04:28.510 --> 01:04:31.670
could be another copy of me
that did the exact same things

01:04:31.670 --> 01:04:34.160
and just didn't get as
lucky as I did at the start

01:04:34.160 --> 01:04:36.240
and just never got into poker.

01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:39.940
So this fact that you do
still need to get lucky,

01:04:39.940 --> 01:04:42.440
even if you make all the right
decisions [INAUDIBLE] make it

01:04:42.440 --> 01:04:42.939
is--

01:04:42.939 --> 01:04:47.424
It's sort of a tough
thing to swallow.

01:04:47.424 --> 01:04:48.840
This is sort of a
different story,

01:04:48.840 --> 01:04:52.700
but I'd like to argue that
that's sort of true in life,

01:04:52.700 --> 01:04:54.260
too--

01:04:54.260 --> 01:04:56.930
the fact that being
smart and working hard

01:04:56.930 --> 01:05:00.950
doesn't guarantee
success by any means.

01:05:00.950 --> 01:05:05.720
So although that's a
negative thing for poker,

01:05:05.720 --> 01:05:08.930
I'd like to end with what
I call, "the joy of making

01:05:08.930 --> 01:05:10.670
good decisions."

01:05:10.670 --> 01:05:13.310
So even though not
everyone makes it in poker,

01:05:13.310 --> 01:05:16.400
but poker players--

01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:18.864
we like to talk about sort
of, you're not really there.

01:05:18.864 --> 01:05:21.530
You shouldn't be trying to think
about making money or whatever.

01:05:21.530 --> 01:05:23.960
You're sort of just
there to enjoy the game,

01:05:23.960 --> 01:05:26.480
and have an honest
opinion on your ability,

01:05:26.480 --> 01:05:29.031
and calibrate your confidence.

01:05:29.031 --> 01:05:31.280
I've told the Bill Gates/Doyle
Brunson story but yeah,

01:05:31.280 --> 01:05:34.280
basically, Bill Gates, I
think, was a pretty good poker

01:05:34.280 --> 01:05:36.970
player for quite a while.

01:05:36.970 --> 01:05:37.970
And he would make money.

01:05:37.970 --> 01:05:42.892
And clearly, it was not
his best way to make money.

01:05:42.892 --> 01:05:45.350
He could probably just go to
his company and make like $500

01:05:45.350 --> 01:05:48.480
a second or something like that.

01:05:48.480 --> 01:05:50.720
But when asked about it,
Bill Gates would just say,

01:05:50.720 --> 01:05:53.000
I love making good decisions.

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.420
I love thinking about this
game and making decisions.

01:05:55.420 --> 01:05:58.040
And even though, clearly, the
money means nothing to me,

01:05:58.040 --> 01:06:01.070
it's still important to
me, as a personal goal,

01:06:01.070 --> 01:06:03.170
to succeed at this
game and make money,

01:06:03.170 --> 01:06:05.460
even though it
doesn't mean anything.

01:06:05.460 --> 01:06:07.910
So it's about this joy
of making good decisions.

01:06:07.910 --> 01:06:10.670
And I think part of the
reason Bill Gates was

01:06:10.670 --> 01:06:13.381
able to be quite good was
because the money meant nothing

01:06:13.381 --> 01:06:13.880
to him.

01:06:13.880 --> 01:06:15.504
He didn't really care
about his results

01:06:15.504 --> 01:06:17.240
and how much he made
or lost, clearly.

01:06:17.240 --> 01:06:21.720
He just focused on making
the best decisions.

01:06:21.720 --> 01:06:26.030
And so it is true that there's
a decent amount of luck in poker

01:06:26.030 --> 01:06:30.790
but, yes, I would argue, life is
luck, and you only live once--

01:06:30.790 --> 01:06:32.630
there's all these
sayings but, overall,

01:06:32.630 --> 01:06:35.720
the thing to keep in mind is,
like Jennifer Shahade talked

01:06:35.720 --> 01:06:38.220
about this with the
"Goldilocks" video--

01:06:38.220 --> 01:06:41.170
so you want to think of your
life and/or your poker career

01:06:41.170 --> 01:06:44.840
or whatever as one long session
where you're just trying

01:06:44.840 --> 01:06:46.530
to make the best decisions.

01:06:46.530 --> 01:06:49.040
And even if you don't get
the best results today,

01:06:49.040 --> 01:06:52.010
hope that you get better
results throughout the course

01:06:52.010 --> 01:06:54.280
of your life.

01:06:54.280 --> 01:06:57.380
So yeah, that's the
end of what I wanted

01:06:57.380 --> 01:07:00.590
to say about the
general poker and what

01:07:00.590 --> 01:07:02.180
I hope you take
away from this class

01:07:02.180 --> 01:07:06.860
from a non-mathematical,
non-poker point of view.

01:07:06.860 --> 01:07:09.410
I guess there is a bit
of time for questions.

01:07:09.410 --> 01:07:11.600
There's a lot of things
I didn't talk about,

01:07:11.600 --> 01:07:16.050
but I'm happy to
answer questions about.

01:07:16.050 --> 01:07:20.070
Yeah, I'm happy to answer
any questions, now.

01:07:20.070 --> 01:07:22.082
Yeah?

01:07:22.082 --> 01:07:25.730
AUDIENCE: Now that there are no
longer any class tournaments,

01:07:25.730 --> 01:07:28.710
where can I go to play to
get better and improve?

01:07:32.740 --> 01:07:34.640
WILL MA: So there's
an MIT poker club,

01:07:34.640 --> 01:07:37.000
and they run tournaments
on PokerStars

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:40.550
similar to the way
the class works.

01:07:40.550 --> 01:07:42.920
The way you can get
into the poker club

01:07:42.920 --> 01:07:46.250
is so [INAUDIBLE] is part of it.

01:07:46.250 --> 01:07:48.200
She's like one of the execs.

01:07:48.200 --> 01:07:49.550
Maybe you should ask her.

01:07:49.550 --> 01:07:50.300
Send her an email.

01:07:50.300 --> 01:07:51.487
I can ask her.

01:07:51.487 --> 01:07:53.570
I'll ask her, and I'll
send something to the class

01:07:53.570 --> 01:07:55.570
if you guys are interested
in continuing playing

01:07:55.570 --> 01:07:57.820
poker on PokerStars and--

01:07:57.820 --> 01:08:01.310
yeah, so there's
the MIT Poker Club.

01:08:01.310 --> 01:08:03.590
And I know in the
past, sometimes

01:08:03.590 --> 01:08:06.860
the classes continued
playing tournaments

01:08:06.860 --> 01:08:08.362
after the class is over.

01:08:08.362 --> 01:08:10.820
We would have like a tournament
every Saturday or something

01:08:10.820 --> 01:08:13.150
for people to play,
but I don't know if--

01:08:13.150 --> 01:08:14.278
they didn't last very long.

01:08:14.278 --> 01:08:16.069
I think people quickly
lost interest in it.

01:08:16.069 --> 01:08:18.020
But yeah, I think
just the poker club.

01:08:18.020 --> 01:08:21.350
Actually, Martin, you're
in the Poker Club, right?

01:08:21.350 --> 01:08:23.789
So maybe you can something
to answer that question.

01:08:23.789 --> 01:08:26.957
AUDIENCE: So sometimes we have
[INAUDIBLE] games where people

01:08:26.957 --> 01:08:29.840
can play like $0.25,
$0.50 [INAUDIBLE]..

01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:34.880
So there's like a
million you can get on.

01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:36.580
WILL MA: OK, I'll
find some information

01:08:36.580 --> 01:08:37.930
from [INAUDIBLE] and Martin.

01:08:37.930 --> 01:08:39.100
I'll send something
to the class,

01:08:39.100 --> 01:08:40.641
and I'll give you
guys some pointers.

01:08:43.404 --> 01:08:44.779
AUDIENCE: How do
you, personally,

01:08:44.779 --> 01:08:46.583
deal with downswing?

01:08:49.910 --> 01:08:51.950
WILL MA: Yeah, so
definitely, I've

01:08:51.950 --> 01:08:54.340
gone through bad
downswings and times

01:08:54.340 --> 01:08:56.620
where I really hated the game.

01:08:56.620 --> 01:08:58.390
I think I mostly
just took a break.

01:08:58.390 --> 01:09:01.060
So yeah, I mostly
just took a break.

01:09:04.660 --> 01:09:08.894
My first couple of downswings
when I was first starting,

01:09:08.894 --> 01:09:10.810
I just took a break from
the game for a while,

01:09:10.810 --> 01:09:13.720
like a month or something,
and then came back.

01:09:13.720 --> 01:09:14.859
That's sort of what I did.

01:09:14.859 --> 01:09:19.454
Nowadays, I'd say like the
last four years, I've been--

01:09:19.454 --> 01:09:21.370
I'd like to think I was
fairly good at dealing

01:09:21.370 --> 01:09:22.300
with downswings.

01:09:22.300 --> 01:09:24.580
I sort of went through
enough downswings

01:09:24.580 --> 01:09:27.689
where I kind of was able to
just keep it together through it

01:09:27.689 --> 01:09:28.439
for the most part.

01:09:28.439 --> 01:09:30.290
Like maybe I'd
play slightly less,

01:09:30.290 --> 01:09:32.158
but I wouldn't quit altogether.

01:09:36.062 --> 01:09:39.405
AUDIENCE: So for small cash
games online, what kind of edge

01:09:39.405 --> 01:09:40.864
do you think you have?

01:09:40.864 --> 01:09:41.700
WILL MA: For small?

01:09:41.700 --> 01:09:43.283
AUDIENCE: And then
what kind of edge--

01:09:43.283 --> 01:09:46.050
what is your like, borderline
edge where it suddenly wouldn't

01:09:46.050 --> 01:09:47.472
become worth it anymore?

01:09:47.472 --> 01:09:52.390
WILL MA: Oh, so how much
edge do I think I have?

01:09:52.390 --> 01:09:55.751
So in online cash games--

01:09:55.751 --> 01:09:58.000
the thing is, I don't really
specialize in cash games,

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.320
so I never really play them.

01:10:00.320 --> 01:10:02.230
So I'd say it's
probably very little.

01:10:02.230 --> 01:10:04.420
I mean, I'm sure I can find
low enough stakes where

01:10:04.420 --> 01:10:05.770
I'll have a significant edge--

01:10:05.770 --> 01:10:07.394
AUDIENCE: Or even in
tournaments, then?

01:10:07.394 --> 01:10:08.990
Online small stakes tournaments?

01:10:08.990 --> 01:10:14.290
WILL MA: Yeah, yeah,
so in tournaments, I'd

01:10:14.290 --> 01:10:19.960
say there's still a decent
edge, and I'll play it for--

01:10:19.960 --> 01:10:22.855
but mostly, I'd I'll play
poker, mostly, for fun nowadays.

01:10:25.810 --> 01:10:30.850
I rarely force myself to do
it for making money, I'd say.

01:10:30.850 --> 01:10:32.380
Most of the time
I'm playing, I'm

01:10:32.380 --> 01:10:33.838
still trying to
make good decisions

01:10:33.838 --> 01:10:35.950
because I enjoy doing
that, but I'm not really

01:10:35.950 --> 01:10:40.126
doing it for the power
degree or whatever.

01:10:40.126 --> 01:10:42.815
AUDIENCE: So what about maybe
the best cash-game player

01:10:42.815 --> 01:10:45.863
in the world, how much would
they make in about $0.25/$0.50

01:10:45.863 --> 01:10:46.362
online?

01:10:46.362 --> 01:10:50.620
WILL MA: Oh, $0.25/$0.50 online?

01:10:50.620 --> 01:10:53.230
So I don't have a great sense
of this, but let me think.

01:10:55.910 --> 01:11:00.190
So the thing is, the players who
are sort of considered the top

01:11:00.190 --> 01:11:03.400
players in the world who
play like very high stakes--

01:11:03.400 --> 01:11:06.820
like nosebleeds stakes with
like $100/$200 big blinds

01:11:06.820 --> 01:11:07.950
or something--

01:11:07.950 --> 01:11:10.090
it's sort of, the
variance is so high

01:11:10.090 --> 01:11:12.290
that it's not really
accepted who's

01:11:12.290 --> 01:11:14.590
the best because if it
was accepted, you know,

01:11:14.590 --> 01:11:18.650
someone had a win rate
over someone else,

01:11:18.650 --> 01:11:21.250
then the guy who was worse
just wouldn't be playing.

01:11:21.250 --> 01:11:22.840
So the only reason
those games run

01:11:22.840 --> 01:11:24.880
is because they all think
they have a win rate.

01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:27.250
So it's hard for me
to say the number

01:11:27.250 --> 01:11:28.870
because I'm not
going to know better

01:11:28.870 --> 01:11:31.312
than what they're true win
rates are against each other.

01:11:31.312 --> 01:11:33.520
And they're all going to
tell me something different,

01:11:33.520 --> 01:11:36.430
because they all think they're
beating the other guys.

01:11:36.430 --> 01:11:38.460
As far as how much
a really top player

01:11:38.460 --> 01:11:42.457
can win at a low-stakes
game, it's still

01:11:42.457 --> 01:11:43.720
going to be very significant.

01:11:43.720 --> 01:11:50.830
I think making something maybe
like, five or six big blinds

01:11:50.830 --> 01:11:53.344
per 100.

01:11:53.344 --> 01:11:55.260
Yeah, five or six big
blinds per 100, I think,

01:11:55.260 --> 01:11:57.550
is maybe doable at a
reasonably low stakes--

01:11:57.550 --> 01:11:59.230
if you're like one
of the very best.

01:12:02.740 --> 01:12:03.570
It's quite a lot.

01:12:03.570 --> 01:12:04.510
It's quite generous.

01:12:04.510 --> 01:12:08.180
But let's say every 100 hands
you make five big blinds.

01:12:08.180 --> 01:12:14.650
So let's say you
play $0.25/$0.50,

01:12:14.650 --> 01:12:15.730
five big blinds is $250.

01:12:15.730 --> 01:12:17.610
You make that every 100 hands.

01:12:17.610 --> 01:12:22.660
If you play six tables, you
can get in about 100 hands

01:12:22.660 --> 01:12:24.650
per hour, 120 hands per hour.

01:12:24.650 --> 01:12:27.040
So that's 600 hands per hour.

01:12:29.680 --> 01:12:32.680
So it's six times
$250; so it's like $15.

01:12:32.680 --> 01:12:35.580
So it's not a lot, but I mean
those guys can play stakes way

01:12:35.580 --> 01:12:38.950
higher than $0.25/$0.50 and
still have a slightly smaller

01:12:38.950 --> 01:12:40.040
edge.

01:12:40.040 --> 01:12:46.480
So if you imagine
they play 250/$5.

01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:49.739
Then suddenly, you multiply,
then that'll give me about $10.

01:12:49.739 --> 01:12:52.030
I mean you would be decreasing
it because they probably

01:12:52.030 --> 01:12:53.990
wouldn't make five
big blinds per hour--

01:12:53.990 --> 01:12:57.482
five big blinds per 100.

01:12:57.482 --> 01:12:59.690
But I think those numbers
are ballpark correct, yeah.

01:13:04.650 --> 01:13:05.642
All right, yeah?

01:13:05.642 --> 01:13:08.122
AUDIENCE: What's a good
for playing at a casino,

01:13:08.122 --> 01:13:09.479
like exploiting people?

01:13:09.479 --> 01:13:11.770
WILL MA: What's a good strategy
for playing at a casino

01:13:11.770 --> 01:13:12.686
and exploiting people?

01:13:19.270 --> 01:13:22.560
One general thing that's
going to do is, you go there--

01:13:22.560 --> 01:13:27.250
you sleep at night, and you go
there at like 7:00 AM and play

01:13:27.250 --> 01:13:30.003
against people who have
been tilted and angry for--

01:13:30.003 --> 01:13:30.950
[LAUGHTER]

01:13:30.950 --> 01:13:33.360
And you just woke up
at 7 AM in the morning.

01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:36.730
And you're in such a good mood,
and they're all in a bad mood,

01:13:36.730 --> 01:13:39.310
and you can win a lot of money.

01:13:39.310 --> 01:13:42.700
In terms of specific
strategy, I think

01:13:42.700 --> 01:13:44.650
it depends a lot on the player.

01:13:44.650 --> 01:13:48.130
I think, in general, playing
tight is pretty good.

01:13:48.130 --> 01:13:49.660
At least I'd say
I consider myself,

01:13:49.660 --> 01:13:51.340
in general, a
tight player, and I

01:13:51.340 --> 01:13:54.160
think a decent
amount of money can

01:13:54.160 --> 01:13:56.470
be made at casinos against
recreational players

01:13:56.470 --> 01:13:58.990
just by them getting bored.

01:13:58.990 --> 01:14:01.950
Like at a nine-headed table,
you're only paying the blinds--

01:14:01.950 --> 01:14:04.570
1 and 1/2 blinds
every nine hands.

01:14:04.570 --> 01:14:06.220
You can easily
get away with only

01:14:06.220 --> 01:14:09.380
playing like pocket nines
plus, ace-queen plus.

01:14:09.380 --> 01:14:13.104
I mean, that's extreme, but
they'll probably still call you

01:14:13.104 --> 01:14:14.020
because they're bored.

01:14:14.020 --> 01:14:16.080
They're not going to
think like, this guy's--

01:14:16.080 --> 01:14:17.390
I'm going to just fold--

01:14:17.390 --> 01:14:19.120
so one disadvantage
of that strategy

01:14:19.120 --> 01:14:20.680
is, they're just always
going to fold to you.

01:14:20.680 --> 01:14:22.805
But in practice, I don't
think that's what happens.

01:14:22.805 --> 01:14:26.650
So I think, in
general, playing tight

01:14:26.650 --> 01:14:29.660
will always be a pretty
good strategy at casinos

01:14:29.660 --> 01:14:33.525
against recreational players.

01:14:33.525 --> 01:14:35.004
AUDIENCE: Yeah?

01:14:35.004 --> 01:14:39.400
Do you have any
advice for avoiding

01:14:39.400 --> 01:14:46.160
this pitfall of thinking you're
good and you're not actually?

01:14:46.160 --> 01:14:48.790
WILL MA: Not really, because
I think it's happened to me

01:14:48.790 --> 01:14:50.140
a lot of times.

01:14:54.490 --> 01:14:59.055
Yeah, I think it really is
hard to judge, especially

01:14:59.055 --> 01:14:59.680
in tournaments.

01:14:59.680 --> 01:15:01.450
In cash games, it's
slightly easier

01:15:01.450 --> 01:15:04.630
to judge because you can just
look at your data points,

01:15:04.630 --> 01:15:06.580
and it'll converge faster.

01:15:06.580 --> 01:15:09.220
In tournaments, the variance
is so high you can't really

01:15:09.220 --> 01:15:10.654
use your tournament results.

01:15:10.654 --> 01:15:12.820
I think the most important
thing, for me personally,

01:15:12.820 --> 01:15:17.050
was just talking to players and
having very honest friends who

01:15:17.050 --> 01:15:20.110
would tell me if they thought
I was worse than someone else

01:15:20.110 --> 01:15:21.570
and tell them not to play them.

01:15:21.570 --> 01:15:23.320
And I think that's
probably the thing that

01:15:23.320 --> 01:15:26.410
benefited me the most-- just
being able to talk to players

01:15:26.410 --> 01:15:29.320
better than me or at
a similar level to me

01:15:29.320 --> 01:15:33.070
and just getting their opinion
from them talking to me.

01:15:33.070 --> 01:15:36.170
If they think I'm not good
enough, I want them to tell me.

01:15:36.170 --> 01:15:39.940
And I think that's one of the
most important things is just

01:15:39.940 --> 01:15:44.714
getting good feedback from your
friends and honest feedback.

01:15:44.714 --> 01:15:45.540
Yeah?

01:15:45.540 --> 01:15:48.760
AUDIENCE: Since we
can't play online here,

01:15:48.760 --> 01:15:51.937
and we can't do it at the
casino like every weekend--

01:15:51.937 --> 01:15:54.270
so we can't play for money--
what's some good motivation

01:15:54.270 --> 01:15:57.817
to keep the Saturday game?

01:15:57.817 --> 01:15:59.650
Is this like poker
mentality, and these kids

01:15:59.650 --> 01:16:02.100
will have development
in whatever they

01:16:02.100 --> 01:16:04.330
like [INAUDIBLE] jobs?

01:16:04.330 --> 01:16:06.080
WILL MA: OK, so I'll
address a few things.

01:16:06.080 --> 01:16:08.150
So one thing that I didn't
really formally announce--

01:16:08.150 --> 01:16:09.733
but yeah, so one
thing you pointed out

01:16:09.733 --> 01:16:11.800
is, playing online
poker for money

01:16:11.800 --> 01:16:13.750
is illegal in Massachusetts.

01:16:19.720 --> 01:16:22.210
The police can't
come arrest you,

01:16:22.210 --> 01:16:25.135
but the website will
take all your money

01:16:25.135 --> 01:16:27.260
if they find out you're
playing from Massachusetts.

01:16:27.260 --> 01:16:30.030
But I don't believe it's
written in Massachusetts

01:16:30.030 --> 01:16:31.650
law or something.

01:16:31.650 --> 01:16:34.050
To my knowledge, the
police can't arrest you.

01:16:34.050 --> 01:16:36.880
But yeah, so the question
was, if we can't play online,

01:16:36.880 --> 01:16:38.380
what can we do?

01:16:38.380 --> 01:16:41.600
So I think it is legal
in New Jersey and Nevada.

01:16:41.600 --> 01:16:43.640
So you can move to
New Jersey or Nevada.

01:16:46.300 --> 01:16:48.770
OK, yeah, so if you don't
want to go to the casino

01:16:48.770 --> 01:16:51.506
every weekend, so
what else can you do?

01:16:51.506 --> 01:16:53.380
OK, so what's the
motivation to keep playing?

01:16:53.380 --> 01:16:55.480
So I think I've
tried in this class

01:16:55.480 --> 01:16:58.510
to give examples
of where I think

01:16:58.510 --> 01:17:05.410
poker is very useful, just in
terms of how poker is related

01:17:05.410 --> 01:17:09.190
to nonpoker stuff, like
calibrating your confidence,

01:17:09.190 --> 01:17:11.680
figuring out what your biases
are, and stuff like that.

01:17:11.680 --> 01:17:13.170
And I also think
it's a fun game.

01:17:13.170 --> 01:17:15.120
It's a very fun game.

01:17:15.120 --> 01:17:16.660
It's mathematically interesting.

01:17:16.660 --> 01:17:20.100
But yeah, I mean, if you don't
enjoy playing the game much,

01:17:20.100 --> 01:17:23.100
and sense you can't really
make money playing it

01:17:23.100 --> 01:17:25.536
in Massachusetts, yeah, then,
if both of those are true,

01:17:25.536 --> 01:17:26.910
then there's not
that much reason

01:17:26.910 --> 01:17:28.600
to play it if you
don't enjoy it.

01:17:28.600 --> 01:17:30.183
I think that's just
the biggest thing.

01:17:30.183 --> 01:17:32.720
If you enjoy it and you
enjoy the decision-making,

01:17:32.720 --> 01:17:35.843
I think it's very fun, and
it's also very good for you.

01:17:35.843 --> 01:17:37.322
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

01:17:40.280 --> 01:17:43.367
WILL MA: All right, cool.

01:17:43.367 --> 01:17:44.950
Yeah, so if there's
no more questions,

01:17:44.950 --> 01:17:50.230
then I guess we'll call
it here, and then Friday

01:17:50.230 --> 01:17:51.650
will be the last class.

01:17:51.650 --> 01:17:53.483
There's two more nights
of tournaments left.

01:17:53.483 --> 01:17:55.960
And yeah, I'm excited for
Friday for Bill's lecture

01:17:55.960 --> 01:17:58.310
and to hand out the prizes.

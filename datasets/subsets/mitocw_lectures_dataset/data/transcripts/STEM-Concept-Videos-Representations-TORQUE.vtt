00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:08.020
Here are two people. They're both standing,
but they're standing in two completely different

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:13.530
ways. Which person would it be easier to push
over? If you wanted to push this person [left]

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.199
over, where would you apply a force? What
about this [right] person? The answers to

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:22.380
all these questions can be explained using
the concept of torque.

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.510
This video is part of the Representations
video series. Information can be represented

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:32.590
in words, through mathematical symbols, graphically,
or in 3-D models. Representations are used

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:38.000
to develop a deeper and more flexible understanding
of objects, systems, and processes.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.060
Hi. I'm Sanjay Sarma. Professor of mechanical
engineering at MIT, In this video, we'll be

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:46.820
talking torque and balance.

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.510
In order to understand these core concepts,
you'll need a working knowledge of vectors

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.390
and their uses. Specifically, you must be
familiar with force, displacement, and torque.

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.760
We will also assume that you know how to compute
a cross product, and how to use the Right-Hand

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.060
Rule, and that you have done problems involving
the center of mass of an object.

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:13.109
Our objective is to improve your ability to
draw torque diagrams, and give you some practice

00:01:13.109 --> 00:01:18.959
with setting them up. By the end you should
also understand what is needed for human beings

00:01:18.959 --> 00:01:21.310
to balance.

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.959
We'll start with an activity. Everyone stand
up and spread out across the room. You'll

00:01:25.959 --> 00:01:28.630
need a partner for this activity.

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:33.908
When I say "go," your goal is to carefully
push your partner over. Use the smallest amount

00:01:33.908 --> 00:01:38.380
of force you can. You will switch partners
halfway through, so be gentle.

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:43.899
When you push, consider where you should push,
and in what direction. Try many different

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:45.889
approaches.

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:50.469
Here are some questions that may help you
think about this in a scientific manner. When

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:53.848
it comes to your push, where will you push?

00:01:53.848 --> 00:01:58.908
What direction will you push? How hard will
you push? Consider your partner as well: how

00:01:58.908 --> 00:02:05.090
is your partner standing? What is the floor
like under your partner's feet? Can your partner

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.149
balance well?

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:39.220
Are you ready? Go!

00:02:39.220 --> 00:03:11.390
Switch partners!

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:16.170
Your teacher will now lead you in a short
discussion about this activity. Pause the

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:24.120
video here.

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.630
Let's continue our investigation of torque
and balance in the human body. Take a look

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:35.270
at this next video clip, in which MIT researchers
Colin Fredericks and Jennifer French demonstrate

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:38.930
the effectiveness of properly applied torque.

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:44.980
[Colin speaking] This is called "Sai son"
stance. This is a basic stance in martial

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.870
arts. Known for it's stability along a particular
direction.

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.210
This is my colleague, mathematician Jennifer
French.

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:56.400
Jen knows the stance is strong along certain
directionsâ€“such as the one she is pulling

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.120
in now.

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.850
[laughing] Oops.

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:03.370
It can also withstand a great deal of force
in the opposite direction.

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:09.980
I'm not going to be knocked over if she is
pushing or pulling along that particular line.

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:14.940
However, Jen knows the stance's weak point.

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:22.199
If she pushes along a different line, it'll
knock me right down to the ground.

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:24.879
This isn't just martial arts. This is science.

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:28.659
Torque controls my ability to balance and
we're going to show you how today.

00:04:28.659 --> 00:04:34.610
[Sanjay speaking] To analyze the situation,
let's look at what physical properties are

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:36.550
important here.

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:42.030
What forces do you think are involved? Pause
the video to discuss.

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:53.199
Next, draw a simple diagram that you can use
to find the net torque on this man. Pause

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:56.399
the video while you do this.

00:05:01.069 --> 00:05:05.919
The simplest way to represent this man is
with a rectangle. You should remove any other

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:12.479
details, and draw our forces so that we can
tell exactly where they are applied to his body.

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:16.900
Finally, if you were to draw a diagram showing
someone resisting a push, how would you do

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:21.129
it? Which of these three is most appropriate?

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:24.329
Pause the video to discuss.

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:34.120
You may be wondering why we can use a two-dimensional
diagram to discuss a three-dimensional situation.

00:05:34.129 --> 00:05:40.509
The reason is that all of our forces are applied
in the same plane, simplifying the problem.

00:05:40.509 --> 00:05:45.058
While our torque vectors point in and out
of the screen on this diagram, we can represent

00:05:45.058 --> 00:05:51.889
that fairly easily. In a more complex situation,
we may need to draw something more fully three-dimensional,

00:05:51.889 --> 00:05:56.389
as our torques might point in other directions.

00:05:56.389 --> 00:06:02.129
This next video clip will walk you through
a partial analysis of this situation. You

00:06:02.129 --> 00:06:07.089
will need a way to take notes and draw diagrams
while you watch.

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:15.379
[Jen speaking] I couldn't push Colin over
by applying force in the stable direction.

00:06:15.379 --> 00:06:19.739
Yet when I applies the same force in a different
direction, I could push him over.

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:21.340
How did I know this?

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:22.360
Torque.

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:26.759
Here you see two 2-dimensional views representing
Colin.

00:06:26.759 --> 00:06:29.740
The width of the base represents the distance
between his feet.

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:32.939
The wide square is the view of Colin from
the side and stable states.

00:06:32.939 --> 00:06:36.839
The narrow rectangle is the view of Colin
from straight on.

00:06:36.839 --> 00:06:41.319
Lets draw in the forces acting on Colin as
I push him in the stable directions.

00:06:41.319 --> 00:06:43.219
Start by drawing the center of mass.

00:06:43.219 --> 00:06:44.999
Which we assume is at the center of the square.

00:06:44.999 --> 00:06:48.529
The force of gravity pulls straight down with
magnitude three halfs.

00:06:48.529 --> 00:06:52.990
There is also the force of my push of length
one. Which we place in the location where

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:55.360
the force is applied.

00:06:55.360 --> 00:07:00.759
This push shifts Colin's weight entirely to
his back foot. So the normal force is applied

00:07:00.759 --> 00:07:04.210
there with a magnitude equal and opposite
that of force p.

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:08.849
The force of friction is also at this foot.
Equal and opposite the magnitude and direction

00:07:08.849 --> 00:07:10.319
of the push force.

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:14.339
Recall that torque is r cross F.

00:07:14.339 --> 00:07:18.210
That is, torque occurs when a force is applied
some displacement distance from a reference

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:19.080
point.

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:22.729
We can choose any reference point we like,
and the net torque we compute will be the

00:07:22.729 --> 00:07:23.439
same.

00:07:23.439 --> 00:07:26.599
For this problem I will choose the reference
point to be the pivot point.

00:07:26.599 --> 00:07:30.469
Why don't you try this problem but choose
the center of mass as the reference point.

00:07:30.469 --> 00:07:32.550
Lets get back to the problem.

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:36.569
The push force and the gravitation force are
applied some distance from the pivot point

00:07:36.569 --> 00:07:37.360
at the foot.

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:38.869
So they will create torque.

00:07:38.869 --> 00:07:43.150
However, the friction force and normal force
are applied at the pivot point.

00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:47.210
So R is zero and we can ignore that when we
compute the net torque.

00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:49.479
Lets compute the torque due to the push force.

00:07:49.479 --> 00:07:53.279
The vector r is the displacement from the
pivot point to where the force is applied.

00:07:53.279 --> 00:07:56.580
We decompose this vector into its x and y
components.

00:07:56.580 --> 00:08:01.520
We use a coordinate system with origin at
the pivot point to determine the r vector

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:05.900
to be 4i + 3j.

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:12.499
The magnitude of the push force is negative
one i.

00:08:12.499 --> 00:08:17.469
The magnitude of torque can be found as the
magnitude of r times the magnitude of F times

00:08:17.469 --> 00:08:18.219
sin theta.

00:08:18.219 --> 00:08:20.849
Where theta is the angle between the two vectors.

00:08:20.849 --> 00:08:27.619
Thus the magnitude is the area of the parallelogram
formed by r and F.

00:08:27.619 --> 00:08:33.750
Since the area of this parallelogram is also
the area of the rectangle formed by F and

00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:37.890
r sin theta or the component of r that is
perpendicular to F.

00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:41.289
We can see this magnitude visually as the
area of this rectangle.

00:08:41.289 --> 00:08:46.130
We will show the magnitudes in this way because
it is very easy to see the relative magnitudes

00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:47.790
of the various torques.

00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:49.200
So...

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:58.280
For the push force the area is 3, which mean
the magnitude of the torque is 3.

00:08:58.290 --> 00:09:03.020
The direction of the torque vector is along
the axis of rotation caused by this force.

00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:05.290
We find the direction using the right hand
wall.

00:09:05.290 --> 00:09:09.690
Point our fingers along r and curl along F.

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:15.430
In this case we find the direction to be out
of the board or positive k.

00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:23.050
So this tells us that the torque due to the
push force is equal to 3k.

00:09:23.050 --> 00:09:28.200
We can also find the torque vector by taking
the determinate of the following three by

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:29.990
three matrix.

00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:33.530
The first row is i, j, and k.

00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:38.390
The second row are the x, y, and z components
of the r vector.

00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:43.060
And the third row are the x, y , and z components
of the force vector.

00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:50.060
Because r and F lie in the same plane, the
z components are zero.

00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:56.180
In our example, the force is pointing in the
negative i direction and r we found to be

00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:57.980
4 i plus 3 j.

00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:06.090
Computing it this way, we also find that the
torque is 3k.

00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:08.490
Now let's find the torque due to gravity.

00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:12.080
The vector r is found by connecting the pivot
point to the center of mass.

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:17.220
We leave to you to pause the video and to
determine the components of r using this coordinate

00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:20.830
system.

00:10:20.830 --> 00:10:26.540
We find the magnitude of the torque by taking
the component of r that is perpendicular to

00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:32.600
F pointing in the x direction, and the magnitude
is the area of the rectangle between these

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:33.850
two vectors.

00:10:33.850 --> 00:10:36.880
Again, we find the direction using the right
hand rule.

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:42.530
We find the torque to be pointing into the
board at the pivot point.

00:10:42.530 --> 00:10:47.940
Since the x component of the r vector is 2,
and the force due to gravity is 3 halves,

00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:49.830
pointing in the negative j direction.

00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:55.020
The magnitude of the torque due to gravity
is 3 and it points in the negative k direction.

00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:58.600
So the torque is negative 3 k at the pivot
point.

00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:04.210
Adding the push torque and the gravity torque
together we find that we get zero.

00:11:04.210 --> 00:11:08.950
This means that there is no rotation about
the pivot point.

00:11:08.950 --> 00:11:10.890
Now let's look in the unstable direction.

00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:16.450
We have all the same forces as before- force
of gravity at the center of mass, the push

00:11:16.450 --> 00:11:25.080
force, a normal force at the back foot, as
well as a friction force.

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:29.900
The magnitudes of these forces are all the
same as in the other diagram.

00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:35.370
Let's compute the torque due to the push force.
The vector r connects the pivot point to the

00:11:35.370 --> 00:11:39.110
place where the force is applied.

00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:44.050
Using our coordinate axes with the origin
placed at the pivot point, we find this vector

00:11:44.050 --> 00:11:51.300
to be i plus 3 j.

00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:55.390
We find the magnitude of the torque vector
is the area of the rectangle formed by force

00:11:55.390 --> 00:11:59.440
vector and the component of r, perpendicular
to F.

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:06.070
Thus the area is one times three, or three.

00:12:06.070 --> 00:12:08.830
In order to find the direction, we use the
right hand rule. Point our fingers along r,

00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:14.090
curl in the direction of F, and our thumb
points out of the board, so the direction

00:12:14.090 --> 00:12:16.090
of our torque is k.

00:12:16.090 --> 00:12:21.300
Since the magnitude is 3, that tells us that
torque due to the push is 3 k at the pivot

00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:22.500
point.

00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:25.670
Finally, let's find the torque due to gravity.

00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:29.620
Start by drawing the r vector from the pivot
point to the center of mass.

00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:33.320
Now let's decompose this vector into it's
x and y components.

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:42.620
We leave this as an exercise to you, using
the coordinate system shown here.

00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:46.510
The magnitude of the torque due to gravity
at the pivot point is found by the area of

00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:52.570
the rectangle form by the force vector and
the x component of the r vector.

00:12:52.570 --> 00:12:56.500
The direction is found using the right hand
rule, pointing our fingers along r and curling

00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:57.800
around F.

00:12:57.800 --> 00:13:02.260
In other words, into the board or negative
k.

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:11.680
So the torque due to gravity is one-half times
three-halves or three-fourths pointing in

00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:14.310
the negative k direction.

00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:17.170
The net torque about the pivot point is the
sum of these two.

00:13:17.170 --> 00:13:22.200
In other words, the torque push plus the torque
due to gravity is the net torque around the

00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:26.550
pivot point, which is two and a quarter the
positive k direction.

00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:36.450
That means there is a total net rotation about
the pivot point. Causing Colin to fall over.

00:13:36.450 --> 00:13:41.550
We leave it as an exercise for you to use
the determinate in order to compute the torque

00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:42.650
vectors.

00:13:42.650 --> 00:13:47.090
If you computed the net torque using the center
of mass as the reference point, you should

00:13:47.090 --> 00:13:51.680
notice that the net torques that you found
are equal to the net torques that we computed

00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:53.020
here.

00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:59.940
[Sanjay speaking] Now that you've seen torque
and balancing in detail, let's consider a

00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:04.600
more complex problem. This one is a bit tricky.
I'll show you how it works.

00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:07.380
I'm going to take a chair and place it next
to the wall.

00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:13.760
I'll put my toes up to the wall, and step
back, toe-to-heel, twice.

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:17.680
I step sideways until I'm over the chair.

00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:23.520
Then I bend forward until my head touches
the wall, pick up the chair, and stand up...

00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:25.690
er... or not.

00:14:25.690 --> 00:14:30.430
This is something that most women can do,
but men cannot.

00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:37.810
Maybe you think it's a trick? Here's a video
of some of your professors trying to lift

00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:39.350
[Jen speaking]Okay, walk up to the wall.

00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:39.850
Yes.

00:14:39.850 --> 00:14:41.810
Then heel toe heel toe.

00:14:41.810 --> 00:14:43.620
That's it. One more time.

00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:46.860
And now translate over but don't come in or
out.

00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:47.680
Okay.

00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:50.740
Now bend over to the the wall. Bend over.
Put your head on the wall.

00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:51.240
Mmm-hmm.

00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:53.560
Pick the chair up.

00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:54.760
Now stand up.

00:14:54.770 --> 00:14:55.300
Hah!

00:14:55.300 --> 00:15:01.240
[laughing]

00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:03.180
That's fair enough. Don't hurt yourself.

00:15:03.180 --> 00:15:06.140
No, no. There was actually no way. [laughing]

00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:09.200
Toes against the wall.

00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:11.600
One.

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:16.400
Two. Okay, translate over. You might be able
to do it because his feet are proportionately

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:17.740
small.

00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:19.860
Okay, down.

00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:21.260
Pick it up.

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:23.080
[giggle]

00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:26.200
Pick up the chair first. Please pick up of
the chair please.

00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:27.720
Now stand up.

00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:29.400
[laughing]

00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:33.600
Okay. One over.

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:35.540
Bend over.

00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:39.880
Ohhh, okay.

00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:41.280
Alright.

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:45.960
Okay, then do it one more time with the other
foot.

00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:52.060
Okay, now can translate over a little bit?
Just move over but don't go in or out.

00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:58.320
Well, no. You want a line there.
Actually... be in a little.

00:15:58.320 --> 00:15:59.880
There you go.

00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:02.000
No no no- you're fine! Just even up your feet.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:02.500
Okay.

00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:05.960
Bend over. Put your hands on the wall, just
so you don't hit your head.

00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:07.560
Okay...

00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:10.320
now pick up the chair.

00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:12.280
Now stand up.

00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:17.100
No no. Don't do it again. You have to pick
up the chair. Clean pick up.

00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:19.080
Now stand up.

00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:26.120
Alright! [clapping]

00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:28.520
[Sanjay speaking] Now it's your turn to try.

00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:32.480
Get together with your partner again and bring
a chair over to the wall.

00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:42.020
Why don't you pause the video and give it
a try?

00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:45.900
Now that you've attempted the chair lift,
let's return to our seats and discuss what

00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:47.550
happened.

00:16:47.550 --> 00:16:51.990
If you wanted to figure out why this happens,
what information would you need?

00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:54.690
What assumptions would you have to make?

00:16:54.690 --> 00:16:59.600
Discuss the matter with your partner. Try
to draw a diagram of the situation.

00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:03.040
Pause the video here while you work this out.

00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:11.359
Many of you should be wondering about the
center of mass for this situation.

00:17:11.369 --> 00:17:17.099
This diagram shows typical locations for the
center of mass in men (on the left) and women

00:17:17.099 --> 00:17:18.809
(on the right).

00:17:18.809 --> 00:17:22.880
Not only are men typically taller, but their
center of mass is usually higher in their

00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:23.970
bodies.

00:17:23.970 --> 00:17:28.309
This is not always true, but it is fairly
typical.

00:17:28.309 --> 00:17:33.230
Using this information, work with your partner
to try to explain what is happening.

00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:37.230
Why can women lift the chair when men cannot?

00:17:37.230 --> 00:17:40.280
You do not need to obtain a numerical solution.

00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:45.530
Instead, use reasoned arguments, diagrams,
and well-supported assumptions to prove your

00:17:45.530 --> 00:17:46.910
answer.

00:17:46.910 --> 00:17:52.690
Only use calculations if you cannot support
your answer in any other way.

00:17:52.690 --> 00:17:56.210
Pause the video and give it a try.

00:17:59.770 --> 00:18:01.980
Are you ready to see the solution?

00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:04.780
Let's take a look.

00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:09.030
For this section we will measure torques around
the center of mass.

00:18:09.030 --> 00:18:13.280
This will simplify our work so that we don't
have to worry about the person's mass and

00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:15.809
the pull of gravity.

00:18:15.809 --> 00:18:18.590
This diagram shows the man lifting the chair.

00:18:18.590 --> 00:18:23.050
You can see that the center of mass is outside
his body, and has been moved farther forward

00:18:23.050 --> 00:18:25.580
and down by the chair.

00:18:25.580 --> 00:18:27.660
This diagram shows the same for the woman.

00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:34.100
Her center of mass is also outside her body,
but is much closer to her legs.

00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:39.490
If we draw a line for the man to indicate
where his toes are, you see that the center

00:18:39.490 --> 00:18:41.820
of mass is beyond the edge of his foot!

00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:47.420
No matter how hard he tries, he simply cannot
apply force in the right place to lift that

00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:49.290
chair.

00:18:49.290 --> 00:18:54.180
On our diagram, we can see that the torque
will always point in the direction out of

00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:55.170
the screen.

00:18:55.170 --> 00:19:00.660
It will rotate the man counterclockwise, pushing
his head harder into the wall.

00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:04.490
The harder he pushes, the worse it will be.

00:19:04.490 --> 00:19:08.430
The woman, however, has her center of mass
above her feet.

00:19:08.430 --> 00:19:13.830
She can stand up because her feet are able
to apply force in the proper location and

00:19:13.830 --> 00:19:14.680
direction.

00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:22.380
If we draw a torque diagram, we can see that
the direction of torque applied by her feet

00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:24.490
will be into the screen.

00:19:24.490 --> 00:19:29.790
By applying more force, she can rotate her
upper body clockwise and stand up, whereas

00:19:29.790 --> 00:19:32.920
the man cannot.

00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:37.610
Today we hope that you have improved your
ability to draw torque diagrams, and to analyze

00:19:37.610 --> 00:19:41.050
torque problems that occur in the real world.

00:19:41.050 --> 00:19:45.710
Torque is an important quantity that comes
into play in countless situations around us,

00:19:45.710 --> 00:19:50.660
from machinery to buildings to the simple
act of walking. I hope you enjoyed this look

00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:55.320
at one of its fascinating applications.

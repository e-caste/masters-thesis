00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:28.910
PROFESSOR: I apologize
for the delay.

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.080
But we are ready
for multimedia show

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.030
with three different
applications.

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:35.260
One of them are the clickers.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.590
I hope you all took a clicker.

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.848
It's just two questions today,
but really good questions.

00:00:40.848 --> 00:00:42.640
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.337
So today's actually
very nice topic.

00:00:46.337 --> 00:00:48.420
I think almost every lecture
we have a nice topic,

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.570
but today's especially nice.

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.770
It's called Unraveling
Open Quantum System.

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:56.360
That may not tell you so much.

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.310
Well unravelling means we
want to sort of untangle it,

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:01.850
We want to understand
what is inside.

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.349
And so we want to develop
a better understanding what

00:01:05.349 --> 00:01:08.260
is inside a density matrix.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.710
How can we think about
the quantum system

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.930
in an even more microscopic
way than the density

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.390
matrix tell us?

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.050
And again, this finds
applications in atomic physics,

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.275
because one application of it
is spontaneous emission optical

00:01:24.275 --> 00:01:25.540
block equations.

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.910
On the other hand,
actually, this class

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:29.760
will also teach you
something very general

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.720
about quantum physics.

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:41.440
So today's lecture is this part.

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.380
We'll have three topics.

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:51.360
One is I want to provide a
motivation for single quantum

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.440
systems.

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:54.980
And you should appreciate this.

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:59.250
A single quantum system is not
what Schrodinger and Heisenberg

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.620
told us about.

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.866
Quantum mechanics was formulated
as an ensemble average.

00:02:03.866 --> 00:02:10.240
But today we want to talk about,
is there something in addition?

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.060
About single quantum systems.

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:19.730
Part two is-- addresses the
derivation of the quantum Monte

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.220
Carlo wave function method.

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.650
And this is a formalism,
which is really

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.250
simulating in quite general
terms, quantum physics

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.630
by following-- using quantum
Monte Carlo simulations--

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.250
trajectories of individual
quantum systems.

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.990
So here the individual
quantum system--

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.960
even if you have one, even
if you don't have one--

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:43.120
becomes a computational tool.

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.080
And eventually in
part two I want

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.620
to give you another example
for unraveling open quantum

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:56.540
system, which differ from
the models for dephasing.

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.580
And if you remember that this
was on one of your homework

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.000
assignment that's correct.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.210
I sort of want to here
take your homework

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:08.100
into the classroom discussion.

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.070
Well I think it's nice to start
this lecture with the quote

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:13.832
by Erwin Schrodinger.

00:03:13.832 --> 00:03:16.550
Where he said, "We
never experiment

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:19.370
with just one electron,
or atom, or molecule.

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.600
In thought experiments, we
sometimes assume that we do;

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:28.700
this inevitably entails
ridiculous consequences."

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.670
Well today we want to talk about
those ridiculous consequences,

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:37.380
because many people
in our field trap,

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:41.255
address, and observe single
electrons and single atoms.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.630
Now this is related
to quantum jumps.

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:53.770
Quantum jumps has even made
it into the popular realm.

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:58.050
You can find lots and lots of
references on quantum jumping,

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:00.610
but I warn you this
is about quantum

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:02.810
jumping into different worlds.

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:05.770
It's about broadening
your horizon.

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:08.640
And those authors,
those people actually,

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.780
sell you something by claiming
that people like Einstein

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:17.480
and Stephen Hawking would
support the idea that you can

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:21.640
jump into different universe,
experience another version

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:24.920
of yourself-- probably a
better version of yourself--

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:27.110
and this will
inspire you to change

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.880
your life in the world you live.

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.750
But-- So this is
quantum jumping.

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:33.810
I'm not talking about
quantum jumping,

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:37.780
I will only talk
about quantum chunks.

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:44.150
So what you see here is
really a classic experiment.

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:45.910
One of three
experiments which were

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:47.820
done almost simultaneously.

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:49.620
There have always been
races for, you know,

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:51.170
the first observation
of something.

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:53.880
And there was the [? Hamburg ?]
group by [? Toshak ?],

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:56.150
the Seattle group
by Hunt [INAUDIBLE],

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:59.000
and the Boulder
Group by Dave Wylen,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.580
who observed the phenomenon
of quantum jumps for the first

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:03.310
time.

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:05.190
Let me just tell you
what it is, because it's

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:07.780
exactly what you're
going to describe.

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:11.500
Here in this situation
you have a system.

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:15.560
It's a trapped barium
ion with a p and s state.

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:19.970
And there is very
fast transition

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:22.370
where you can rapidly
scatter light, and get

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:25.605
lots of fluorescence,
at 493 nanometer.

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:33.870
But what happened is,
every once in a while,

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:44.520
the particle has a branching
ratio to decay to d state,

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:50.310
and, well, d to s 2 units
of angular momentum.

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:55.910
The transition here down to
the ground state is very slow.

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:57.930
It's slow because
it's forbidden.

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:00.950
It's even slower
because it happens

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:05.980
at longer wavelengths
of 1,600 nanometer.

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:07.190
And this is slow.

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:12.340
And it has a lifetime
of about 50 second.

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:17.580
So you-- If you think
about it naively

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:19.370
and that's probably
the correct approach--

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:21.970
you would say the
particles in the s state,

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:23.140
it's like a light bulb.

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:26.210
It scatters many, many
photons, but then it

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:28.030
branches to the d state.

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:30.210
And for 50 seconds
the light bulb

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:33.410
is switched off, until
the particle spontaneously

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:35.710
goes down to the s state,
and then the light bulb

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:37.420
is switched on.

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:40.100
And this is exactly
what people observed.

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:42.469
But I mean I was-- This was '86.

00:06:42.469 --> 00:06:44.260
That was the time I
was a graduate student,

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.190
and I talked with
theorists in the field,

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:48.650
and respectable
theorists told me

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:50.640
that there was a
controversy-- probably

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:53.250
not among experimentalists,
who use the naive

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:55.890
approach-- but theorists
who believed too much

00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:57.990
in what they calculate.

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:00.380
Because if you solve it
quantum mechanically,

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:02.060
and look what you get.

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:03.730
It's a steady state solution.

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:04.670
Atom in steady state.

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:06.020
Laser in steady state.

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:09.560
And if you calculate the quantum
mechanical expectation value,

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:13.030
the expectation value is
constant as a function of time.

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:15.420
So a simple quantum
calculation would

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:18.740
say the fluorescence
is on average.

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:20.940
Well just the time
average and his constant,

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:22.770
and his time independent.

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:25.190
So there were some
serious doubts

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:27.650
whether you would observe
this, or something

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:30.840
which looks more like
the ensemble average.

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:35.260
Well made all of the theorists
soon realize you cannot

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.510
calculate the steady
state average.

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:40.080
You have to calculate
the correlation function

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:41.080
in steady state.

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:43.190
And the steady state
correlation function

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:45.940
has structure exactly
at 50 seconds.

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:48.590
So in a steady state
system, if you're

00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:51.760
interested in fluctuations
and temporal behavior,

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:54.320
you can't just
calculate quantities,

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:57.530
you have to calculate
correlation functions

00:07:57.530 --> 00:07:59.250
of quantities.

00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:02.110
So anyway-- But then
of course, if you now

00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:05.270
average over many,
many realizations,

00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:09.730
you find exactly an exponential
decay of 50 seconds.

00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:11.660
And this is sort
of what you would

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:14.970
get for an ensemble average.

00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:17.200
So this is what
quantum jumps are.

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:19.090
This is what you
should always imagine

00:08:19.090 --> 00:08:23.340
when we talk about quantum jumps
in the rest of this lecture.

00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:25.910
But I also want to show
you more recent example

00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:29.520
from Serge Haroche,
in Paris, where

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:32.860
they observed quantum jumps.

00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:36.520
Recording a single
photon in a cavity.

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:39.750
So what happens is there's a
single photon in this cavity,

00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:41.730
and they can read
out whether there

00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:45.230
is a photon or not by sending
Rydberg atoms through.

00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:48.210
And a single photon
is never observed,

00:08:48.210 --> 00:08:51.640
but it causes a phase
shift, an AC-Stark shift,

00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:53.330
on the Rydberg atom.

00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:56.010
And then they can read out
with a Ramsey interferometer

00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:57.750
the AC-Stark shift.

00:08:57.750 --> 00:09:01.080
So every atom which
passes through the cavity

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:04.910
will tell you whether
there is a photon or not.

00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:08.740
And-- And this is shown here.

00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:12.830
Blue means no,
there is no photon.

00:09:12.830 --> 00:09:14.720
Red means there is a photon.

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:18.850
So here you repeatedly figure
out again there is no photon.

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:21.060
And suddenly there
is a quantum jump

00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:23.455
when the cavity has
absorbed a photon,

00:09:23.455 --> 00:09:26.750
or when a thermal
photon was released.

00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:29.060
You may say, what happened here?

00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:30.640
Well no measurement is perfect.

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:31.680
There is some noise.

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:33.910
But by seeing that
these are outliers,

00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:37.250
you clearly see that here
is a photon in the cavity,

00:09:37.250 --> 00:09:42.030
and here where the red
read out of the atom

00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:45.610
overwhelms the blue readout
here you have no photon.

00:09:45.610 --> 00:09:50.690
And then as time goes by, you
can observe the death and birth

00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:54.450
of micro-cavity photons.

00:09:54.450 --> 00:09:57.320
So these are now quantum
jumps in the-- not

00:09:57.320 --> 00:10:01.400
in atomic population, but
quantum jumps in the photon

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:04.814
number in a cavity.

00:10:04.814 --> 00:10:07.244
AUDIENCE:What's the
time scale on that?

00:10:07.244 --> 00:10:09.200
Seconds?

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:10.710
PROFESSOR: Yeah, time is second.

00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:15.940
So what is shown here is-- I
think what is shown is here

00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:22.955
are 300 milliseconds, and
this is 2.5 second element.

00:10:22.955 --> 00:10:26.210
AUDIENCE: What was the
density of each line mean?

00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:29.350
PROFESSOR: Each line
is a Rydberg atom,

00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:32.290
which has been readout with
a Ramsey interferometer.

00:10:32.290 --> 00:10:32.791
And--

00:10:32.791 --> 00:10:34.290
AUDIENCE: So that
means that they're

00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:35.520
leaving no, like between--

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:36.978
PROFESSOR: I think
that means there

00:10:36.978 --> 00:10:40.380
was a Rydberg atom in state e,
which means there is a photon.

00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:42.840
And blue means, the
blue bar means, there

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:45.790
was a Rydberg atom in state g.

00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:50.340
These are two highlighting
states of the rubidium atom.

00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:52.300
Sort of each spike
here is one readout

00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:55.750
of the microchannel plate.

00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:57.530
So these are detector clicks.

00:10:57.530 --> 00:10:59.180
You can say, yes.

00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:02.322
You can sort of say, blue
is yes, and red is no.

00:11:02.322 --> 00:11:03.530
And these are the two clicks.

00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:06.302
AUDIENCE: Yeah, but, like the
separation between two clicks

00:11:06.302 --> 00:11:07.882
is not uniform.

00:11:07.882 --> 00:11:09.840
PROFESSOR: No, because
if you're an atomic beam

00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:12.600
the atoms come not
equally spaced out.

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:14.700
There's a randomness
when the atom comes.

00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:18.700
I think it's posed only in
statistics in this experiment.

00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:19.790
It's a real experiment.

00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:21.184
It's amazing.

00:11:21.184 --> 00:11:21.850
Other questions?

00:11:21.850 --> 00:11:22.380
Team One.

00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:23.671
AUDIENCE: So one more question.

00:11:23.671 --> 00:11:25.630
So the, for example,
the first bit of blue

00:11:25.630 --> 00:11:29.502
is all measurements for the
same state of the cavity.

00:11:29.502 --> 00:11:31.217
I know blue means
photon or no photon,

00:11:31.217 --> 00:11:32.800
but if it does mean
photon, that means

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:35.880
it's the same photon
interacting with--

00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:37.272
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:11:37.272 --> 00:11:38.730
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:41.170
PROFESSOR: Yes, because, I
mean, this is something people

00:11:41.170 --> 00:11:43.370
know that the photon
number in this cavity

00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:45.930
only changes over
very long time scales.

00:11:45.930 --> 00:11:49.310
And you sort of see,
kind of, exactly

00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:53.890
hear how-- You see
here two quantum jumps.

00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:55.730
One from blue to
red, and one from red

00:11:55.730 --> 00:11:58.858
to blue in this cavity.

00:11:58.858 --> 00:11:59.830
Yes?

00:11:59.830 --> 00:12:01.531
AUDIENCE: I don't if
this is maybe just

00:12:01.531 --> 00:12:04.190
my accent's not very good,
but in the bottom left graph--

00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:04.690
Right?

00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:07.650
Or on the bottom graph, in
sort of the left corner,

00:12:07.650 --> 00:12:09.630
it looks like
there's some overlap

00:12:09.630 --> 00:12:11.610
between the dark blue
and the dark red.

00:12:11.610 --> 00:12:14.085
Yeah.

00:12:14.085 --> 00:12:15.185
PROFESSOR: You mean here?

00:12:15.185 --> 00:12:16.560
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
like right there.

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:20.885
Is that like sort of there is
a photon in that [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:20.885 --> 00:12:21.510
simultaneously?

00:12:25.745 --> 00:12:27.745
PROFESSOR: I think, to
the best of my knowledge,

00:12:27.745 --> 00:12:29.431
I haven't really
looked-- I've heard

00:12:29.431 --> 00:12:31.930
wonderful talks about it.You
can go back and read the paper,

00:12:31.930 --> 00:12:35.290
but this probably means in
the atom number in the cavity,

00:12:35.290 --> 00:12:38.070
and the algorithm they have
used to analyze the data

00:12:38.070 --> 00:12:41.660
says that here the photon
number was 0, jumped to 1,

00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:43.500
and jumped back again.

00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:46.320
So you-- If you see
here, for instance,

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:48.310
there is some overlap,
but you would still

00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:51.320
say, since either there is
a photon or not a photon,

00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:54.010
as long as you have a--
as you have a higher

00:12:54.010 --> 00:12:57.040
number of red clicks
than blue clicks,

00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:59.710
you would say there is a photon.

00:12:59.710 --> 00:13:03.100
And the little overlap, there
is maybe a little bit of time

00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:05.970
where you don't know whether
there is a photon or not.

00:13:05.970 --> 00:13:10.410
But this really-- This is
real, because every measurement

00:13:10.410 --> 00:13:12.560
takes a certain amount of time.

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:14.450
Since you have a
few random clicks,

00:13:14.450 --> 00:13:16.125
if they are a few
random clicks, you

00:13:16.125 --> 00:13:19.070
do not know yet if
the system has jumped,

00:13:19.070 --> 00:13:20.960
you have to wait a little bit.

00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:23.075
But this is really
also showing how

00:13:23.075 --> 00:13:28.480
our knowledge about the
quantum system comes with time.

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:29.880
And therefore,
the wave function,

00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:33.130
or the statistical
operator changes with time,

00:13:33.130 --> 00:13:35.710
because of wave function
and statistical operator

00:13:35.710 --> 00:13:38.950
are simply a description of
our knowledge about the quantum

00:13:38.950 --> 00:13:39.450
system.

00:13:42.372 --> 00:13:47.242
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
is too dense

00:13:55.224 --> 00:13:57.390
PROFESSOR: You could have
a situation, for instance,

00:13:57.390 --> 00:13:59.270
you could prepare
the cavity, that it

00:13:59.270 --> 00:14:01.970
has an equal probability
foreseeable in one.

00:14:01.970 --> 00:14:05.510
And then what you would read out
may just be completely random.

00:14:05.510 --> 00:14:08.200
So that may be possible,
but in their experiment,

00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:12.570
I think, the nature
here is that you

00:14:12.570 --> 00:14:14.410
have most of the
time stable photons,

00:14:14.410 --> 00:14:17.440
because the cavity is cooled
to very low temperature,

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:21.410
and only occasionally does
the thermal distribution,

00:14:21.410 --> 00:14:23.870
the Bose-Einstein distribution
of photons in the cavity

00:14:23.870 --> 00:14:24.780
have a one.

00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:27.540
And what we observe are
the thermal fluctuations

00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:30.610
between mainly 0 and
occasionally a 1.

00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:38.260
If you would make the cavity
and little bit hotter,

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:41.320
it would have maybe
half of the time a 1

00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:43.640
and half of the time 0.

00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:46.540
But that wouldn't mean that
you have completely randomness

00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:50.280
in your results, because
there is a thermal relaxation

00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:52.740
time over which a
photon is created,

00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:54.360
and a photon goes back.

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:57.430
The photon would not jump
back and forth from the cavity

00:14:57.430 --> 00:15:00.290
to the walls of the
cavity in microseconds.

00:15:00.290 --> 00:15:03.600
It would probably
have an exchange time,

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:06.274
and you could sort of measure
the thermal correlation

00:15:06.274 --> 00:15:07.440
time of photons in a cavity.

00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:11.400
It's a really good experiment.

00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:15.590
OK.

00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:18.550
So in that sense I
think I showed you

00:15:18.550 --> 00:15:23.300
that what Schrodinger said
is ridiculous is real,

00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:26.450
is the subject of
current research,

00:15:26.450 --> 00:15:29.180
and since for
quantum information

00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:30.720
processing in
quantum computers, we

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:33.830
need single quantum system
is at the heart of quantum

00:15:33.830 --> 00:15:36.220
information processing.

00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:46.410
So therefore, we
want to now describe

00:15:46.410 --> 00:15:47.740
single quantum systems.

00:16:01.090 --> 00:16:04.710
But when I do that,
I-- come very --

00:16:04.710 --> 00:16:06.640
It will become clear at
the end of this unit,

00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:10.790
but I want to give you
the warning right away.

00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:14.630
The way how I describe now
a single quantum system

00:16:14.630 --> 00:16:15.820
may not be unique.

00:16:19.110 --> 00:16:21.660
There will be,
there is actually,

00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:23.420
an infinite number of ways.

00:16:27.330 --> 00:16:29.040
And I've already
mentioned that to you,

00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:31.160
that there is an
infinite number of ways

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:34.720
to unravel a density matrix.

00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:37.420
I mentioned that you can
write every density matrix

00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:40.380
as a probability of pure states.

00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:42.810
Weighted probability of
being in pure states,

00:16:42.810 --> 00:16:44.417
but there's always
different choices.

00:16:44.417 --> 00:16:46.750
You can get an infinite number
of different combinations

00:16:46.750 --> 00:16:50.320
of pure states, and construct
your density matrix.

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:53.250
So, so this was sort of in
at the level of the density

00:16:53.250 --> 00:16:56.730
matrix, but similarly--
and this will come out

00:16:56.730 --> 00:17:04.452
of this discussion today--
there is also an infinite number

00:17:04.452 --> 00:17:11.089
of ways to unravel the
dynamics-- the dynamics

00:17:11.089 --> 00:17:14.010
involved in the evolution
of an open quantum system.

00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:28.590
So-- so with that I want to
describe the quantum Monte

00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:30.340
Carlo wave function method.

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:37.040
So in the quantum Monte
Carlo wave function method,

00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:40.380
we perform-- We don't
need an experiment.

00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:42.490
We don't need
sophisticated experiments

00:17:42.490 --> 00:17:44.280
to observe a single
quantum system.

00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:46.420
It's a theoretical
method, but we

00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:49.115
perform thought, or
gedanken experiments.

00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:57.850
So our gedanken experiments is
that we perform measurements.

00:17:57.850 --> 00:18:05.540
So we assume-- we
have-- When we want

00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:07.180
to describe an
ensemble of atoms,

00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:09.360
we assume we have a single atom.

00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:11.730
We assume it emits
photon, and then we

00:18:11.730 --> 00:18:14.210
assume that the
photon is detected.

00:18:14.210 --> 00:18:17.080
And the mom-- So the
moment the photon

00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:19.380
is detected we
know, for instance,

00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:21.230
that the atom is in
the ground state.

00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:24.830
And so our quantum Monte
Carlo simulation follows now

00:18:24.830 --> 00:18:28.870
the trajectory of the single
quantum system by saying,

00:18:28.870 --> 00:18:31.110
I toss a coin, there's
a certain probability

00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:32.370
for detecting the photon.

00:18:32.370 --> 00:18:34.420
If I detect the photon,
the system I know

00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:35.650
is in the ground state.

00:18:35.650 --> 00:18:37.510
If I don't detect
the photon, it's

00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:39.150
not in the ground
state, and such.

00:18:39.150 --> 00:18:43.080
And these probabilistic
approach is just simulated

00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:46.340
in the quantum
Monte Carlo sense.

00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:49.950
So-- So what is
in essence-- what

00:18:49.950 --> 00:18:51.850
is the essence of the
quantum Monte Carlo

00:18:51.850 --> 00:18:56.900
method is that we allow a
small time step delta t.

00:18:56.900 --> 00:18:59.530
It's a real time simulation.

00:18:59.530 --> 00:19:02.260
And there is a small
probability that the system

00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:05.320
has decayed in that time.

00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:10.840
So we may now toss a coin-- use
a random function generator--

00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:14.695
and ask, has spontaneous
emission taken place?

00:19:17.210 --> 00:19:20.840
And then the two
possibilities are yes,

00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:23.450
and we continue
whatever the outcome,

00:19:23.450 --> 00:19:25.130
whatever the quantum state is.

00:19:25.130 --> 00:19:32.880
Or we say no, and then with
the probability-- with a-- so

00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:35.060
with a probability,
p, we say yes.

00:19:35.060 --> 00:19:37.380
With a probability
1 minus p we say no,

00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:39.710
and then we continue the
simulation accordingly.

00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:44.420
So this will become
much, much clearer

00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:47.200
when I write down the
formalism for you,

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:51.660
but there is one important
aspect, which I really

00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:52.990
want to discuss with you.

00:19:52.990 --> 00:19:55.420
And this is the
essence of the method.

00:19:55.420 --> 00:19:59.370
Namely, how does
the wave function

00:19:59.370 --> 00:20:00.840
change by your measurement?

00:20:04.450 --> 00:20:09.210
So-- so this is the essential,
the only conceptional part

00:20:09.210 --> 00:20:10.960
for the quantum Monte
Carlo wave function.

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:12.315
Afterwards I just show you.

00:20:12.315 --> 00:20:14.320
Once you have this,
once we have cleared up

00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:17.340
this conceptional part, the
rest is just a few equations.

00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:20.680
And we immediately show that
the quantum Monte Carlo wave

00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:23.700
function method is equivalent
to the optical block equation.

00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:26.170
But let's really feature
and take some time

00:20:26.170 --> 00:20:30.170
for discussing the concept,
namely, the change over wave

00:20:30.170 --> 00:20:33.060
function by a
quantum measurement.

00:20:36.550 --> 00:20:38.670
And maybe what this
carries home to you

00:20:38.670 --> 00:20:42.730
is that the nature of an open
system-- we have a quantum

00:20:42.730 --> 00:20:45.220
system, which interacts
with the environment--

00:20:45.220 --> 00:20:50.100
is, actually, that the
environment permanently

00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:52.170
performs measurements.

00:20:52.170 --> 00:20:54.890
And you will actually see
that the idea of performing

00:20:54.890 --> 00:20:59.620
measurements, formalized in
the quantum Monte Carlo sense,

00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:02.540
gives us an equation for
the density matrix, which

00:21:02.540 --> 00:21:05.400
is identical to the
optical block equation.

00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:07.550
So in other words, you
can say I am re-deriving

00:21:07.550 --> 00:21:10.780
for you master equation now,
but from a very, very different

00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:11.680
perspective.

00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:14.370
From the perspective
of an environment

00:21:14.370 --> 00:21:16.205
which constantly
performs measurement.

00:21:18.770 --> 00:21:19.270
OK.

00:21:19.270 --> 00:21:21.140
So let's go through that.

00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:25.280
How-- What happens
in a measurement?

00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:33.150
Well if our initial state is
the ground state-- starting

00:21:33.150 --> 00:21:36.400
very in trivial ways-- well
there is no measurement,

00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:39.865
because the particle will stay
in the ground state forever.

00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:45.160
OK.

00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:48.940
Now let's go to
the next situation

00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:52.830
that our atom starts out
in the excited state.

00:21:52.830 --> 00:22:01.140
Now in a time step delta t,
we have two possibilities.

00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:05.460
A photon can be observed,
or nor photon is observed.

00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:15.210
When the photon is
observed, we know for sure

00:22:15.210 --> 00:22:20.130
that the system is now
projected into the ground state.

00:22:20.130 --> 00:22:23.870
If no photon is
observed, well the system

00:22:23.870 --> 00:22:25.320
is still in the excited state.

00:22:27.881 --> 00:22:28.380
OK.

00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:31.092
So we've discussed what happens
when the system is initially

00:22:31.092 --> 00:22:33.050
in the ground, and when
the system is initially

00:22:33.050 --> 00:22:35.280
in the excited state.

00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:39.390
But now comes the
following question.

00:22:39.390 --> 00:22:42.600
We prepare the system
in a superposition

00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:46.820
of ground and excited state.

00:22:46.820 --> 00:22:53.010
And we want to
discuss what happens

00:22:53.010 --> 00:22:54.250
when the photon is observed?

00:22:57.740 --> 00:23:00.970
What happens when no
photon is observed?

00:23:00.970 --> 00:23:04.130
I think if you observe
the photon it's

00:23:04.130 --> 00:23:07.150
pretty clear we have to
assume after photon emission

00:23:07.150 --> 00:23:10.050
the system is in
the ground state.

00:23:10.050 --> 00:23:16.060
But if no photon is observed, I
want to give you three choices,

00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:20.480
and you should address
them with the clicker.

00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:30.010
One choice is that the particle
stays in the same state.

00:23:30.010 --> 00:23:36.440
The second choice is
that the particle stays

00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:40.780
in a superposition state,
but the probability

00:23:40.780 --> 00:23:45.540
to be in the excited
state decays.

00:23:45.540 --> 00:23:47.380
Also no photon
has being emitted,

00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:50.460
or no photon has been observed.

00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:55.020
And the third possibility
is something else.

00:24:01.180 --> 00:24:05.410
So in other words, assume
you're an observer,

00:24:05.410 --> 00:24:08.440
and you know with 100%
detection probability--

00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:11.330
let's not discuss technical
issues-- you have completely

00:24:11.330 --> 00:24:14.410
surrounded your system
with perfect detectors.

00:24:14.410 --> 00:24:18.880
And you know in the time
step delta t, in the time t,

00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:21.200
no photon was observed.

00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:23.240
And now you should
make a prediction

00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:25.240
what happens next to
the quantum system.

00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:27.950
And you make the
prediction by assuming

00:24:27.950 --> 00:24:31.010
that the system is described
by a wave function or density

00:24:31.010 --> 00:24:32.150
matrix.

00:24:32.150 --> 00:24:37.220
And I'm asking you, which
of the three choices

00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:41.760
correctly describes what the
system will do afterwards?

00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:44.900
What the system will do next?

00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:46.910
Is the question very clear?

00:24:46.910 --> 00:24:48.395
Good.

00:24:48.395 --> 00:24:52.355
[TAPPING]

00:24:59.160 --> 00:24:59.660
OK.

00:25:10.013 --> 00:25:11.196
All right.

00:25:11.196 --> 00:25:13.880
Pretty good.

00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:19.520
A lot of people when I taught
the class before said it's A,

00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:21.570
the wave function
is not changing,

00:25:21.570 --> 00:25:24.310
because no photon
has been emitted.

00:25:24.310 --> 00:25:37.150
Now in-- For those people, but
there only few among those,

00:25:37.150 --> 00:25:39.405
I would have now asked
the next question.

00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:55.990
If you have-- If you have
a 50-50 superposition,

00:25:55.990 --> 00:25:59.980
of ground and excited
state-- And let's

00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:03.630
say the spot time for
spontaneous emission

00:26:03.630 --> 00:26:17.150
is 10 nanoseconds-- But
now you wait one second,

00:26:17.150 --> 00:26:23.010
and after 1 second, no
photon has been observed.

00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:28.980
What is your prediction?

00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:33.620
In what state is the
system at this point?

00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:36.030
Is the system in
the ground state?

00:26:36.030 --> 00:26:40.570
Or is the system in,
still in, a superposition

00:26:40.570 --> 00:26:42.090
of ground and excited state?

00:26:45.090 --> 00:26:47.250
Well since we have to
clicker, you can tell me.

00:26:47.250 --> 00:26:49.159
Is it-- Is it still a
superposition state,

00:26:49.159 --> 00:26:50.700
or is the system in
the ground state?

00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:31.020
OK.

00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:36.200
So now you have to help me out,
because the people who said B,

00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:42.410
if they would go back to
here-- And most people said

00:27:42.410 --> 00:27:48.140
it is B. If you put in gamma 10
nanoseconds, the inverse of 10

00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:50.940
nanosecond, and the
time is 1 second,

00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:54.910
the excited state amplitude,
the excited stated mixture,

00:27:54.910 --> 00:27:58.620
is 10 to the minus nothing.

00:27:58.620 --> 00:28:00.670
So-- OK.

00:28:00.670 --> 00:28:03.545
If you want to be a
mathematician and say--

00:28:03.545 --> 00:28:04.760
[LAUGHING]

00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:07.860
--there is epsilon 10
to the minus 10, yes.

00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:10.150
Then you can say there is
still a small admixture

00:28:10.150 --> 00:28:11.680
to the excited state.

00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:14.590
But by making it so
extreme-- 10 nanoseconds

00:28:14.590 --> 00:28:19.050
versus a second-- at least
in all practical terms,

00:28:19.050 --> 00:28:22.010
the system is in
the ground state.

00:28:22.010 --> 00:28:23.810
And I think this
should teach you

00:28:23.810 --> 00:28:26.260
what it means if you
have a system which

00:28:26.260 --> 00:28:29.970
is in the superposition of
ground and excited state,

00:28:29.970 --> 00:28:33.060
and after 1 second it
has not emitted a photon.

00:28:33.060 --> 00:28:35.180
I mean--

00:28:35.180 --> 00:28:37.230
Then you would say,
it had its chance.

00:28:37.230 --> 00:28:39.340
It had plenty of
chances to emit,

00:28:39.340 --> 00:28:42.180
but it decided it
doesn't want to emit.

00:28:42.180 --> 00:28:45.130
And that would mean
your 50/50 superposition

00:28:45.130 --> 00:28:47.020
of ground and
excited state means

00:28:47.020 --> 00:28:50.760
the atom decided that
it's in the ground state.

00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:53.200
You should also realize
a 50% superposition

00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:55.630
of ground and
excited state means

00:28:55.630 --> 00:28:59.150
in half, in 50% of the
cases there will never

00:28:59.150 --> 00:29:02.470
be a photon emitted.

00:29:02.470 --> 00:29:04.920
So in other words,
what you should realize

00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:09.580
is if your 50-50% superposition
of ground and excited state,

00:29:09.580 --> 00:29:13.070
that the quantum
evolution of this system

00:29:13.070 --> 00:29:23.470
is-- after a long
time the system

00:29:23.470 --> 00:29:29.680
is definitely positively,
absolutely in the ground state.

00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:33.300
It's always in the ground
state after a long time.

00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:41.970
In 50% of the cases with
emission of a photon,

00:29:41.970 --> 00:29:47.750
in 50% of the cases without
emission of a photon.

00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:56.150
If you have a
radioactive-- ensemble

00:29:56.150 --> 00:30:01.840
of radioactive nuclei-- and
let's say half of the atoms

00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:05.832
are in the excited state
and [INAUDIBLE] and half are

00:30:05.832 --> 00:30:10.430
in the ground state-- and you
send the sample to your friend,

00:30:10.430 --> 00:30:14.820
and your friend waits many,
many, many half times,

00:30:14.820 --> 00:30:17.680
common sense tells you that
all the particles are now

00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:19.870
in the ground state.

00:30:19.870 --> 00:30:22.615
Also only half of them have
decayed, because the other half

00:30:22.615 --> 00:30:24.610
were in the ground
state to begin with.

00:30:24.610 --> 00:30:26.930
I mean this is what
quantum physics tells us.

00:30:26.930 --> 00:30:29.320
This is what a 50/50
superposition is.

00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:35.520
But quantitatively
this is, of course,

00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:41.995
included in this
result-- which magically

00:30:41.995 --> 00:30:45.120
that almost all of you
got right-- namely there

00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:47.430
is a superposition of
ground and excited state,

00:30:47.430 --> 00:30:49.940
but the excited state
amplitude decays.

00:30:49.940 --> 00:30:53.870
And to the limit, in the limit
that the time is much longer

00:30:53.870 --> 00:30:57.110
than the decay time, no matter
what the coefficient initially

00:30:57.110 --> 00:30:59.050
was in front of
the excited state,

00:30:59.050 --> 00:31:01.191
this coefficient
has decayed to 0.

00:31:11.020 --> 00:31:12.902
Any question about that?

00:31:15.790 --> 00:31:20.150
Let me just
emphasize that, again

00:31:20.150 --> 00:31:24.410
in giving you also an example in
the reference, a 0 measurement.

00:31:32.910 --> 00:31:38.360
A 0 measurement modifies
the wave function.

00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:42.620
You can also put it like this,
what the wave function is

00:31:42.620 --> 00:31:44.920
is the best knowledge you
would have about this system.

00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:48.110
The wave function is a way
to predict what happens next,

00:31:48.110 --> 00:31:50.820
and it's the most precise
way to predict it.

00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:53.930
More accurate predictions than
the wave function always cannot

00:31:53.930 --> 00:31:56.910
be made, because of Heisenberg's
uncertainty relation.

00:31:56.910 --> 00:32:00.010
But what happens is,
if you have a 50/50%

00:32:00.010 --> 00:32:02.170
superposition of ground
and excited state,

00:32:02.170 --> 00:32:05.910
and the system has not emitted,
then you would say initially

00:32:05.910 --> 00:32:08.860
my guess was half of the atoms
were excited, half of the atoms

00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:10.460
are in the ground state.

00:32:10.460 --> 00:32:12.770
But if none of them
has decayed for awhile,

00:32:12.770 --> 00:32:15.670
you would say I revise
my estimate now.

00:32:15.670 --> 00:32:18.820
Now I have to assume that
more are in the ground state.

00:32:18.820 --> 00:32:22.660
Because having not decayed means
there is a higher probability

00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:26.260
that the system has actually--
is in the ground state

00:32:26.260 --> 00:32:27.460
to begin with.

00:32:27.460 --> 00:32:32.210
So this is how this way of
dealing with a wave function

00:32:32.210 --> 00:32:35.150
automatically adjusts
for the knowledge

00:32:35.150 --> 00:32:38.090
you have gained
about the system.

00:32:38.090 --> 00:32:40.520
Let me give you another
example which carries home

00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:44.350
the same message, and I take
it from a pedagogical paper

00:32:44.350 --> 00:32:54.888
from Dickey, from American
Journal of Physics, 49, 926,

00:32:54.888 --> 00:32:57.850
1981.

00:32:57.850 --> 00:33:02.750
And what he discussed
is the following.

00:33:02.750 --> 00:33:09.310
You have a box and originally
your atomic wave function

00:33:09.310 --> 00:33:11.400
is completely localized.

00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:14.310
Your Bose-Einstein condensate
if you want in this box,

00:33:14.310 --> 00:33:16.980
or let's just assume one
atom to be more precise,

00:33:16.980 --> 00:33:19.860
and it's completely delocalized.

00:33:19.860 --> 00:33:25.130
But now you focus a laser
beam into the system.

00:33:25.130 --> 00:33:28.180
And the laser beam
would ionize your atom,

00:33:28.180 --> 00:33:31.630
and you could count the
ion with 100% probability.

00:33:31.630 --> 00:33:35.150
And for a short moment,
you flash on the laser

00:33:35.150 --> 00:33:42.210
and the result is
yes, you count.

00:33:42.210 --> 00:33:44.490
You get a count.

00:33:44.490 --> 00:33:47.340
In that moment you
would say my wave

00:33:47.340 --> 00:33:50.240
function is more localized.

00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:51.450
I revise my estimate.

00:33:55.140 --> 00:33:58.340
Well maybe I
shouldn't say ionized.

00:33:58.340 --> 00:34:00.710
If it's ionized you
destroy the atom.

00:34:00.710 --> 00:34:03.410
Let's just say you observe
fluorescence so the atom is

00:34:03.410 --> 00:34:04.170
still alive.

00:34:04.170 --> 00:34:06.440
But now you have to
say that the atom is

00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:09.030
localized in that region.

00:34:09.030 --> 00:34:14.710
However, if you don't
observe anything,

00:34:14.710 --> 00:34:17.820
you would say, well
now it's actually

00:34:17.820 --> 00:34:20.670
more probable that
the atom is outside.

00:34:20.670 --> 00:34:23.600
Because if it had been
in the laser beam,

00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:26.670
with a certain probability, I
would have detected a photon.

00:34:26.670 --> 00:34:28.730
But the non-detection
of a photon

00:34:28.730 --> 00:34:31.090
means that I revise my estimate.

00:34:31.090 --> 00:34:33.000
And I say it's
much more probable

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:34.625
that the atom is
outside the laser beam

00:34:34.625 --> 00:34:36.300
than inside the laser beam.

00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:42.130
So this here is exactly how a
non-observation of anything,

00:34:42.130 --> 00:34:46.530
a 0 measurement, modifies
your wave function.

00:34:46.530 --> 00:34:49.340
And the formalism
to incorporate that

00:34:49.340 --> 00:34:53.250
is what we have
discussed before.

00:34:57.350 --> 00:34:57.920
Yes?

00:34:57.920 --> 00:34:58.419
Cody?

00:34:58.419 --> 00:35:01.680
AUDIENCE: So your arguments
here so far work the same way

00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:03.730
as if it's in a
wave function, you

00:35:03.730 --> 00:35:06.042
have just an entire
Pascal probability,

00:35:06.042 --> 00:35:09.539
and we're updating our
understanding of probability.

00:35:09.539 --> 00:35:11.471
Like you haven't
included anything

00:35:11.471 --> 00:35:13.536
about the relative phase
between these two--

00:35:13.536 --> 00:35:14.910
PROFESSOR: I want
to do that now.

00:35:14.910 --> 00:35:19.402
I mean, I-- This is sort of just
to address the basic concepts

00:35:19.402 --> 00:35:20.860
about what does a
measurement mean,

00:35:20.860 --> 00:35:22.320
what does a 0 measurement mean.

00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:24.700
But now I want to write
down everything for you

00:35:24.700 --> 00:35:25.990
in amplitudes.

00:35:25.990 --> 00:35:30.280
We want to do exactly the
time evolution of the system.

00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:31.910
Nancy?

00:35:31.910 --> 00:35:33.856
AUDIENCE: Is this,
like, inconsistent

00:35:33.856 --> 00:35:35.824
with [INAUDIBLE]
quantum equation?

00:35:35.824 --> 00:35:38.776
Like especially the [INAUDIBLE],
because when you are saying

00:35:38.776 --> 00:35:41.728
that it is admixture of the
ground and excited state,

00:35:41.728 --> 00:35:43.204
and we did not observe--

00:35:53.435 --> 00:35:54.810
PROFESSOR: Then
the superposition

00:35:54.810 --> 00:35:56.430
say that ground
and excited state.

00:35:56.430 --> 00:35:59.720
We are not starting out in
an energy heightened state,

00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:04.040
so therefore, we--
what we have is not

00:36:04.040 --> 00:36:07.890
a sharp value of the energy,
but an expectation value.

00:36:07.890 --> 00:36:10.890
And also if you repeat
the measurement many,

00:36:10.890 --> 00:36:14.695
many times, the average
energy is conserved,

00:36:14.695 --> 00:36:17.320
and this is exactly what energy
conservation in quantum physics

00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:17.955
says.

00:36:17.955 --> 00:36:18.830
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:26.990 --> 00:36:29.480
PROFESSOR: Well if your
particle, if your system,

00:36:29.480 --> 00:36:32.360
is not in an eigenstate
of the Hamiltonian.

00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:34.380
It doesn't have a sharp energy.

00:36:34.380 --> 00:36:38.170
And that would mean that when
you measure the energy now,

00:36:38.170 --> 00:36:39.720
you have fluctuations.

00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:42.830
Sometimes you measure higher,
sometimes you measure lower.

00:36:42.830 --> 00:36:44.600
It's only when
you're in eigenstate

00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:46.470
that you measure a sharp value.

00:36:46.470 --> 00:36:48.830
And therefore you know
from the beginning

00:36:48.830 --> 00:36:51.080
that you will measure
an energy distribution.

00:36:51.080 --> 00:36:53.310
And sometimes you
measure higher,

00:36:53.310 --> 00:36:56.460
and sometimes you measure
lower than the average value.

00:36:56.460 --> 00:36:58.510
There's nothing wrong
about it, but your question

00:36:58.510 --> 00:36:59.320
is a very good one.

00:36:59.320 --> 00:37:02.450
You should-- I
mean those examples

00:37:02.450 --> 00:37:06.220
are really-- On the one
hand they are trivial,

00:37:06.220 --> 00:37:08.940
but on the other hand, it's
very profound what they tell us

00:37:08.940 --> 00:37:11.860
about quantum physics
and how to apply

00:37:11.860 --> 00:37:13.190
conservation laws and such.

00:37:17.270 --> 00:37:17.770
OK.

00:37:17.770 --> 00:37:26.540
I think-- Let's-- Let me now
formalize exactly how this is

00:37:26.540 --> 00:37:31.120
done with all the
bells and whistles.

00:37:31.120 --> 00:37:37.580
We assume we have an initial
wave function, which is now

00:37:37.580 --> 00:37:43.720
an arbitrary superposition state
of ground and excited state.

00:37:46.670 --> 00:37:51.240
And we have the environment,
which, in this case,

00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:53.490
we assume is the 0 photon state.

00:37:53.490 --> 00:37:56.400
It's a vacuum.

00:37:56.400 --> 00:38:01.350
And we want to exactly
solve the Schrodinger

00:38:01.350 --> 00:38:04.000
equation for that system.

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:06.940
But we restrict
ourselves too much,

00:38:06.940 --> 00:38:08.820
to a very small time step.

00:38:08.820 --> 00:38:12.840
The small time step is smaller
than, you know, anything else.

00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:15.050
Than the natural decay time.

00:38:15.050 --> 00:38:17.410
Maybe the inverse
[INAUDIBLE] frequency

00:38:17.410 --> 00:38:19.540
if you drive the system.

00:38:19.540 --> 00:38:22.020
You're not doing it
here, but I will later

00:38:22.020 --> 00:38:25.850
show how you can add a laser
beam and drive the system.

00:38:25.850 --> 00:38:30.600
Or it should also be smaller
than the inverse tuning.

00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:35.920
So what is very important here
is that we want to deal only

00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:38.630
with simple cases,
namely one photon

00:38:38.630 --> 00:38:40.680
has been emitted or not photon.

00:38:40.680 --> 00:38:42.780
So you want to make
sure that there

00:38:42.780 --> 00:38:50.390
is, at most, one
spontaneous emission event

00:38:50.390 --> 00:38:51.865
during the time delta t.

00:38:54.910 --> 00:38:58.840
So what I'm writing down now
is the total wave function

00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:02.030
of the system plus
the environment.

00:39:02.030 --> 00:39:04.450
And now we can evolve it.

00:39:04.450 --> 00:39:09.370
We can ask what happens?

00:39:09.370 --> 00:39:13.890
What is the wave
function time later?

00:39:13.890 --> 00:39:16.530
This can be exactly done by
time-dependent perturbation

00:39:16.530 --> 00:39:17.870
theory.

00:39:17.870 --> 00:39:20.250
And the result is
that the system

00:39:20.250 --> 00:39:27.290
will be in a superposition
of ground and excited state.

00:39:27.290 --> 00:39:29.110
And we want to calculate
the coefficients

00:39:29.110 --> 00:39:30.540
alpha prime and beta prime.

00:39:35.980 --> 00:39:39.040
And we still have
the vacuum state.

00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:43.150
But then we have the possibility
that a photon has been emitted.

00:39:43.150 --> 00:39:46.490
In that case we are
in the ground state.

00:39:46.490 --> 00:39:49.040
And the direct product
with the environment

00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:53.750
involves now the photon emitted
into a certain direction

00:39:53.750 --> 00:39:58.400
with wave vector k, with
the polarization epsilon.

00:39:58.400 --> 00:40:03.630
And we have coefficients
beta, k epsilon,

00:40:03.630 --> 00:40:07.090
and we have to sum over all
possibilities for the photon

00:40:07.090 --> 00:40:07.680
to be emitted.

00:40:11.220 --> 00:40:15.430
So we call this-- So the wave
function of the total system

00:40:15.430 --> 00:40:17.200
has now two parts.

00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:20.190
It's a wave function,
which I call psi 0.

00:40:20.190 --> 00:40:22.840
This is a wave
function which involves

00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:25.830
no photon in the environment.

00:40:25.830 --> 00:40:28.296
And the wave function
psi 1 involves

00:40:28.296 --> 00:40:29.545
one photon in the environment.

00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:35.190
So this is the [INAUDIBLE],
which seems very natural,

00:40:35.190 --> 00:40:37.330
but it's also-- you
could immediately

00:40:37.330 --> 00:40:39.810
prove that these are the
only possibilities, how

00:40:39.810 --> 00:40:41.700
the system can evolve.

00:40:41.700 --> 00:40:46.221
And we can verify this by using
time-dependent perturbation

00:40:46.221 --> 00:40:46.720
theory.

00:40:57.140 --> 00:40:59.730
It's actually almost
everyone of you

00:40:59.730 --> 00:41:04.310
has seen it in either 8.21 or in
a more basic course on quantum

00:41:04.310 --> 00:41:05.030
physics.

00:41:05.030 --> 00:41:06.690
It's time-dependent
perturbation theory

00:41:06.690 --> 00:41:08.680
for the emission of a photon.

00:41:08.680 --> 00:41:11.920
But usually when you see
those treatments there

00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:18.100
reservoir, the environment,
is not treated as explicitly

00:41:18.100 --> 00:41:21.520
as we do it here.

00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:24.140
The theory where this
is treated exactly

00:41:24.140 --> 00:41:28.210
in this way, how we need it,
is the Viegener Biscoff theory.

00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:35.640
Which is nothing else in
the perturbative approach,

00:41:35.640 --> 00:41:37.890
but it's really a
perturbation theory.

00:41:37.890 --> 00:41:40.920
Not just for the atomic system--
how we sometimes present it

00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:43.720
in a simplified version--
it's perturbation theory

00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:47.060
for the total wave function
of the complete system.

00:41:47.060 --> 00:41:48.044
Philmore?

00:41:48.044 --> 00:41:50.504
AUDIENCE: So you mentioned
the time interval [INAUDIBLE]

00:41:50.504 --> 00:41:52.480
is much smaller than
a lot of things.

00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:57.279
But you were ignoring, I take
it, the counter rotating terms?

00:41:57.279 --> 00:41:59.279
In which case we're still
at a large enough time

00:41:59.279 --> 00:42:02.977
step that's average
out, so to speak?

00:42:07.907 --> 00:42:09.879
I simply say this,
because I expected

00:42:09.879 --> 00:42:13.330
to be an e with a photon term.

00:42:13.330 --> 00:42:16.781
From the g going
up, so to speak.

00:42:28.970 --> 00:42:29.800
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:45.180
Well-- The counter
rotating term--

00:42:45.180 --> 00:42:46.960
The first answer I
wanted to give you,

00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:49.030
no this is exact
perturbation theory.

00:42:49.030 --> 00:42:55.300
But I think I get
myself in trouble

00:42:55.300 --> 00:43:01.970
if I would allow-- I would get
myself in trouble if I would

00:43:01.970 --> 00:43:06.500
allow the time step to be
extremely short, because then

00:43:06.500 --> 00:43:09.490
I'm in shorter
than 1 over omega.

00:43:09.490 --> 00:43:12.110
Because during the
time 1 over omega,

00:43:12.110 --> 00:43:18.400
we have-- you can say we
have counter rotating terms.

00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:20.990
Or in other words, this
particle in the ground

00:43:20.990 --> 00:43:23.240
state during a
time 1 over omega,

00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:26.330
particle in the ground state can
emit a photon and reabsorb it.

00:43:26.330 --> 00:43:28.050
These are where
those weird diagrams

00:43:28.050 --> 00:43:30.440
with virtual states,
which we discussed earlier

00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:32.370
in this course.

00:43:32.370 --> 00:43:39.400
So I think I want to assume
here, which I haven't done,

00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:43.730
that the time step is larger
than omega to the minus 1.

00:43:43.730 --> 00:43:46.290
And as you know the
counter rotating term

00:43:46.290 --> 00:43:50.020
has a detuning delta,
which is 2 omega,

00:43:50.020 --> 00:43:52.060
so therefore it is excluded.

00:43:52.060 --> 00:43:54.580
Or in other words, when
we talk about photons

00:43:54.580 --> 00:43:56.650
sent into the
environment, we want

00:43:56.650 --> 00:44:01.550
to talk about real photons,
and not virtual photons.

00:44:01.550 --> 00:44:02.380
Yes, good point.

00:44:07.900 --> 00:44:10.340
OK.

00:44:10.340 --> 00:44:15.340
So if you do simple lowest order
time dependent perturbation

00:44:15.340 --> 00:44:20.710
theory, in the Viegener
Biscoff approach,

00:44:20.710 --> 00:44:25.040
you get an exact
result for beta prime.

00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:29.640
You find that beta prime
in this superposition

00:44:29.640 --> 00:44:34.750
is the original amplitude
beta, but it has decayed with e

00:44:34.750 --> 00:44:38.780
to the minus gamma over 2dt.

00:44:38.780 --> 00:44:42.470
And since we are only
interested in small time steps,

00:44:42.470 --> 00:44:48.050
we can do a linear
expansion of that.

00:44:48.050 --> 00:44:53.160
The probability, dp, that
a photon has been emitted

00:44:53.160 --> 00:45:02.410
is the norm of this
wave function psi 1.

00:45:02.410 --> 00:45:06.500
And this, using Viegener
Biscoff perturbation theory,

00:45:06.500 --> 00:45:12.240
is gamma dt times the
amplitude squared,

00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:17.010
that the system was
excited to begin with.

00:45:17.010 --> 00:45:26.790
And because of the conservation
of the norm, the wave function,

00:45:26.790 --> 00:45:29.350
the norm of the wave
function psi 0-- which

00:45:29.350 --> 00:45:32.640
is a wave function without
a photon being emitted--

00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:34.040
is 1 minus dp.

00:45:39.180 --> 00:45:43.490
So what I'm telling
you here is that this

00:45:43.490 --> 00:45:46.010
is an exact result of
time-dependent perturbation

00:45:46.010 --> 00:45:47.330
theory.

00:45:47.330 --> 00:45:51.000
Often when this-- when textbooks
treat spontaneous emission,

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:52.980
they're more interested
in getting Fermi's gold

00:45:52.980 --> 00:45:54.340
rule at this rate.

00:45:54.340 --> 00:45:57.990
But the same approach-- if
you just write it down--

00:45:57.990 --> 00:46:02.090
tells you how the amplitude
in the excited state evolves.

00:46:06.030 --> 00:46:09.680
So therefore, what we learn
from perturbation theory,

00:46:09.680 --> 00:46:14.970
that alpha prime and beta prime,
the wave, the coefficients

00:46:14.970 --> 00:46:22.090
of the wave function,
without emission of a photon,

00:46:22.090 --> 00:46:26.240
this evolution of
the wave function

00:46:26.240 --> 00:46:35.140
occurs with a
non-emission Hamiltonian.

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:49.330
And this non-emission
Hamiltonian

00:46:49.330 --> 00:46:54.560
is our Hamiltonian
for the atomic system.

00:46:54.560 --> 00:46:59.460
But then we have to account
for spontaneous decay,

00:46:59.460 --> 00:47:02.695
and this is done by
this non-emission part.

00:47:06.090 --> 00:47:10.750
So occasionally
you may have heard

00:47:10.750 --> 00:47:13.150
that people wave
their hands and say,

00:47:13.150 --> 00:47:15.820
your system is described
by a Hamiltonian, which

00:47:15.820 --> 00:47:18.550
has an imaginary part for decay.

00:47:18.550 --> 00:47:20.990
And this is sort of
phenomenological.

00:47:20.990 --> 00:47:24.430
This is definitely not
the case, because, even

00:47:24.430 --> 00:47:26.260
if you have a
Hamiltonian like this,

00:47:26.260 --> 00:47:29.740
a pure state would simply
decay and remain a pure state.

00:47:29.740 --> 00:47:32.490
What we are doing
here explicitly

00:47:32.490 --> 00:47:36.410
is we deal with probability
in the correct way.

00:47:36.410 --> 00:47:39.120
Every time the
system can branch out

00:47:39.120 --> 00:47:43.650
into different possibilities,
two different dimensions

00:47:43.650 --> 00:47:47.750
of the density matrix-- one
has probability delta p,

00:47:47.750 --> 00:47:50.610
one has probability
1 minus delta p--

00:47:50.610 --> 00:47:53.330
and it is only the wave
function associated

00:47:53.330 --> 00:47:56.260
with probability 1
minus delta p, which

00:47:56.260 --> 00:47:59.120
evolves with this Hamiltonian.

00:47:59.120 --> 00:48:02.770
So what I'm telling you
is the exact solution

00:48:02.770 --> 00:48:06.970
for the evolution
of the total system,

00:48:06.970 --> 00:48:10.000
in terms of a density matrix
for the atomic system.

00:48:13.260 --> 00:48:14.510
And this is exact.

00:48:18.430 --> 00:48:34.060
So that means we
can now-- write down

00:48:34.060 --> 00:48:38.620
the-- Just get some extra space.

00:48:41.816 --> 00:48:42.315
Oops.

00:48:42.315 --> 00:48:43.520
How does it do it?

00:48:51.392 --> 00:49:06.690
Nope So we have to
insert new page.

00:49:06.690 --> 00:49:09.070
Yep.

00:49:09.070 --> 00:49:09.570
OK.

00:49:15.540 --> 00:49:16.040
OK.

00:49:16.040 --> 00:49:24.200
So the procedure, how we
implement this exact solution

00:49:24.200 --> 00:49:27.590
of perturbation theory,
is the following.

00:49:27.590 --> 00:49:31.740
We have a time step delta t.

00:49:31.740 --> 00:49:36.290
We compute what
is the probability

00:49:36.290 --> 00:49:43.220
that a photon will be emitted.

00:49:46.090 --> 00:49:53.650
Then we need a ran-- Then we
need a random number generator.

00:49:53.650 --> 00:49:56.630
So we need a number
epsilon, which

00:49:56.630 --> 00:50:03.290
is a random number chosen
in the interval 0 and 1.

00:50:03.290 --> 00:50:11.780
If this random number turns
out to be smaller than delta p,

00:50:11.780 --> 00:50:17.660
then we continue our time
evolution on the computer.

00:50:17.660 --> 00:50:22.170
That psi is now in
the ground state,

00:50:22.170 --> 00:50:24.660
and maybe there is a laser
beam which excites it again.

00:50:24.660 --> 00:50:26.880
And such I will add a few
bells and whistles later.

00:50:29.540 --> 00:50:36.380
Otherwise psi,
our wave function,

00:50:36.380 --> 00:50:42.490
is now the wave function
which is the time evolution

00:50:42.490 --> 00:50:46.310
with a non-emission operator of
the original wave function psi.

00:50:46.310 --> 00:50:48.200
And since we have a
real wave function now

00:50:48.200 --> 00:50:51.837
with probability 1, we have to
re-normalize the wave function

00:50:51.837 --> 00:50:52.670
by this denominator.

00:51:02.490 --> 00:51:05.510
And then we execute
the next time step.

00:51:05.510 --> 00:51:09.720
This means go to 2 and
do the next time step.

00:51:09.720 --> 00:51:12.850
And then you have, so to speak,
if you do it many, many times,

00:51:12.850 --> 00:51:15.980
you get a time direct
trajectory of, so to speak,

00:51:15.980 --> 00:51:17.590
one experiment.

00:51:17.590 --> 00:51:20.510
And then you start again with
your system in a wave function

00:51:20.510 --> 00:51:23.530
psi, and you accumulate
a second experiment.

00:51:23.530 --> 00:51:26.750
And maybe you do it 10,000
times to get enough statistics.

00:51:26.750 --> 00:51:28.820
And then you sum up,
you know, everything

00:51:28.820 --> 00:51:31.130
you want and calculate
all the expectation

00:51:31.130 --> 00:51:34.240
values you want to know
about your quantum system.

00:51:39.260 --> 00:51:50.810
So the claim is that this
method, called quantum Monte

00:51:50.810 --> 00:51:53.760
Carlo wave function
method, is fully

00:51:53.760 --> 00:51:58.260
equivalent to the
optical block equations.

00:51:58.260 --> 00:52:04.080
And I want to prove
it to you by showing

00:52:04.080 --> 00:52:11.850
that, if I take a density
matrix, which is an ensemble

00:52:11.850 --> 00:52:22.080
average, over many
realizations of those quantum

00:52:22.080 --> 00:52:25.510
Monte Carlo trajectories.

00:52:25.510 --> 00:52:30.882
That then this density matrix
follows the differential

00:52:30.882 --> 00:52:32.840
equation, which is your
optical block equation.

00:52:37.670 --> 00:52:40.710
And the proof is shown here.

00:52:40.710 --> 00:52:45.490
So what I told you is the
density matrix after time delta

00:52:45.490 --> 00:52:49.000
t, has now two matrix elements.

00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:51.660
One with probability
delta p, and this

00:52:51.660 --> 00:52:53.190
is-- photon has been emitted.

00:52:53.190 --> 00:52:57.190
System is in the ground state,
with probability 1 minus delta

00:52:57.190 --> 00:52:59.154
p.

00:52:59.154 --> 00:53:04.210
We evolve the quantum state
with a non-emission Hamiltonian.

00:53:07.570 --> 00:53:11.990
And then all what is done
in the next few steps we

00:53:11.990 --> 00:53:14.320
assume that delta t is small.

00:53:14.320 --> 00:53:16.870
We do a Taylor expansion
of the exponent.

00:53:16.870 --> 00:53:19.390
We neglect quadratic
terms in delta t,

00:53:19.390 --> 00:53:20.950
and then we come to this line.

00:53:24.410 --> 00:53:28.640
And if we write this as
rho of t plus delta t,

00:53:28.640 --> 00:53:32.840
minus the original
rho of t, we find

00:53:32.840 --> 00:53:38.130
that this follows differential
equation, which is exactly

00:53:38.130 --> 00:53:40.730
the optical block equations.

00:53:40.730 --> 00:53:43.320
So therefore what we
sort of implemented

00:53:43.320 --> 00:53:45.930
as a form of doing many,
many quantum measurements

00:53:45.930 --> 00:53:50.130
in the environment
is a procedure,

00:53:50.130 --> 00:53:54.155
which is rigorously the
same as the optical block

00:53:54.155 --> 00:53:58.100
equations, which we derived
using a master equation

00:53:58.100 --> 00:53:58.600
approach.

00:54:06.030 --> 00:54:07.310
OK.

00:54:07.310 --> 00:54:11.960
This method is very powerful
for the following reasons.

00:54:11.960 --> 00:54:16.746
If you simulate a density
matrix with, you know,

00:54:16.746 --> 00:54:21.600
an internal states, or external,
internal states-- I should've

00:54:21.600 --> 00:54:23.700
said with in quantum
states, you need

00:54:23.700 --> 00:54:27.320
n times n matrix elements,
which can become quite a memory

00:54:27.320 --> 00:54:29.230
hog for your computer.

00:54:29.230 --> 00:54:33.820
The wave function, at any given
moment, as only n components.

00:54:33.820 --> 00:54:38.150
So therefore there is a
computational advantage

00:54:38.150 --> 00:54:42.360
in using a stochastic
wave function

00:54:42.360 --> 00:54:46.120
approach over simulation
of the density matrix.

00:54:46.120 --> 00:54:48.990
The second thing is that a
lot of people, especially

00:54:48.990 --> 00:54:51.930
experimentalists, like
sort of this approach,

00:54:51.930 --> 00:54:56.150
because it reflects directly
what they do in the experiment.

00:54:56.150 --> 00:55:00.050
And I think it's pretty
clear that with this approach

00:55:00.050 --> 00:55:06.890
you can deal with a great
variety of situations.

00:55:06.890 --> 00:55:10.050
Let me just mention
two obvious extensions.

00:55:10.050 --> 00:55:14.360
One is polarization.

00:55:21.510 --> 00:55:22.500
A photon is detected.

00:55:25.040 --> 00:55:28.570
That means your random number
produced a number epsilon,

00:55:28.570 --> 00:55:31.270
which was smaller than delta p.

00:55:31.270 --> 00:55:41.260
At that point you can create
a second random number,

00:55:41.260 --> 00:55:48.680
which determines if your pull--
if the photon has been detected

00:55:48.680 --> 00:55:51.510
with sigma plus, sigma
minus, or pi polarization.

00:55:54.090 --> 00:55:57.770
Or you can discuss recoil.

00:56:02.270 --> 00:56:07.646
If the photon is-- If
the photon is detected,

00:56:07.646 --> 00:56:11.620
you use-- you throw on
another random function

00:56:11.620 --> 00:56:24.250
generator, which determines what
the k vector of the photon is.

00:56:24.250 --> 00:56:30.730
So what direction each part
k the photon has taken,

00:56:30.730 --> 00:56:34.560
and this determines
now what is the recoil,

00:56:34.560 --> 00:56:37.540
the change in
momentum of your atom.

00:56:37.540 --> 00:56:39.050
So you see, kind
of, you can start

00:56:39.050 --> 00:56:40.840
with an atom at 0 momentum.

00:56:40.840 --> 00:56:43.250
You can see it emits
a photon, and then

00:56:43.250 --> 00:56:45.110
your computer always
makes a choice

00:56:45.110 --> 00:56:46.550
based on the random number.

00:56:46.550 --> 00:56:48.190
And then you say,
OK my photon has now

00:56:48.190 --> 00:56:51.170
received a recoil
kick at 45 degrees.

00:56:51.170 --> 00:56:54.270
Now your wave function of
the photon is such and such,

00:56:54.270 --> 00:56:56.600
and if you add a laser
to the Hamiltonian,

00:56:56.600 --> 00:56:59.430
the recoil may have kicked--
may have Doppler shifted

00:56:59.430 --> 00:57:03.340
the resonance, but everything
is easily taken into account.

00:57:03.340 --> 00:57:05.980
So you see this quantum
Monte Carlo wave function

00:57:05.980 --> 00:57:08.960
method can easily be
extended to describe

00:57:08.960 --> 00:57:11.930
external degrees of freedom,
multiple laser fields, and all

00:57:11.930 --> 00:57:14.750
that.

00:57:14.750 --> 00:57:15.835
Any questions?

00:57:21.740 --> 00:57:22.390
OK.

00:57:22.390 --> 00:57:29.910
Let me now just
generalize the thought,

00:57:29.910 --> 00:57:34.500
but I think you know
already everything about it.

00:57:40.040 --> 00:57:42.760
We talked about the
master equation.

00:57:42.760 --> 00:57:45.820
We talked about the most
general master equation

00:57:45.820 --> 00:57:49.220
in the [INAUDIBLE] platform,
where those operators L

00:57:49.220 --> 00:57:51.420
are the jump operators.

00:57:51.420 --> 00:57:54.960
And the prominent
example for jump operator

00:57:54.960 --> 00:57:57.740
was the signal minus
operator, which

00:57:57.740 --> 00:58:00.780
takes a particle from the
excited state to the ground

00:58:00.780 --> 00:58:01.300
state.

00:58:01.300 --> 00:58:04.810
And this is the jump operator
for spontaneous emission.

00:58:04.810 --> 00:58:06.710
But you may have
many jump operators.

00:58:06.710 --> 00:58:09.770
May be spontaneous emission
of different photons

00:58:09.770 --> 00:58:11.700
with different
polarization and such.

00:58:11.700 --> 00:58:14.690
Or the cavity may lose
a photon, and then we

00:58:14.690 --> 00:58:16.190
have a jump operator
for the cavity.

00:58:16.190 --> 00:58:18.370
We went through that.

00:58:18.370 --> 00:58:22.370
Well that means
now in an exact way

00:58:22.370 --> 00:58:24.200
that the non-emission
Hamiltonian is

00:58:24.200 --> 00:58:27.820
the original Hamiltonian
with an imaginary part, which

00:58:27.820 --> 00:58:29.630
comes because of
those jump operators.

00:58:32.450 --> 00:58:40.680
And the general quantum Monte
Carlo wave function procedure

00:58:40.680 --> 00:58:44.630
is that first you ask,
has something happened?

00:58:44.630 --> 00:58:46.510
Has any jump happened?

00:58:46.510 --> 00:58:50.320
And this gives you the
probability delta p.

00:58:50.320 --> 00:58:55.610
And if-- If no
jump has happened,

00:58:55.610 --> 00:58:57.110
you just do a time
evolution with

00:58:57.110 --> 00:58:59.510
a non-emission Hamiltonian.

00:58:59.510 --> 00:59:10.290
But if a jump has
happened, then the jump

00:59:10.290 --> 00:59:14.690
is now-- the wave function is
projected by the jump operator.

00:59:14.690 --> 00:59:16.320
If you have a sigma
minus operator,

00:59:16.320 --> 00:59:18.160
it takes a particle
to the ground state.

00:59:18.160 --> 00:59:21.230
If you have several operators,
a different jump operator

00:59:21.230 --> 00:59:24.250
may take your particle
to another state.

00:59:24.250 --> 00:59:29.330
And you-- And you then
have a branching ratio

00:59:29.330 --> 00:59:31.500
that you know first
a jump has happened.

00:59:31.500 --> 00:59:34.800
And then the question is,
which jump has happened?

00:59:34.800 --> 00:59:37.110
And you just play the
probabilities game.

00:59:37.110 --> 00:59:39.690
So that you see that the quantum
Monte Carlo wave function

00:59:39.690 --> 00:59:42.400
method can be immediately
be generalized.

00:59:46.430 --> 00:59:53.510
So let me come back
to the special case

00:59:53.510 --> 00:59:56.290
of spontaneous emission.

00:59:56.290 --> 00:59:58.840
In that case, we have
only one jump operator,

00:59:58.840 --> 01:00:00.840
which is sigma minus.

01:00:00.840 --> 01:00:05.140
And the normalization is
the square root of gamma.

01:00:05.140 --> 01:00:12.460
And that actually means that
our quantum trajectory ground

01:00:12.460 --> 01:00:16.160
state, excited state,
is very simple.

01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:21.310
If you start with the system
100% in the excited state,

01:00:21.310 --> 01:00:24.110
it's very trivial what happens.

01:00:24.110 --> 01:00:25.370
Nothing happens.

01:00:25.370 --> 01:00:27.870
But if then the jump
occurs, the particle

01:00:27.870 --> 01:00:30.090
is in the ground state.

01:00:30.090 --> 01:00:34.370
Then nothing happens
then until infinite time.

01:00:34.370 --> 01:00:38.020
You then have to start--
The next trajectory

01:00:38.020 --> 01:00:40.000
you start in the excited state.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:44.240
And this time, by chance of
the random number generator,

01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:46.070
the jump happens later.

01:00:46.070 --> 01:00:49.260
Another time the
jump happens earlier.

01:00:49.260 --> 01:00:53.270
And what you then have to
do is, you have to average,

01:00:53.270 --> 01:00:56.200
over all of those
realizations, what

01:00:56.200 --> 01:00:58.830
is the probability
for the particle

01:00:58.830 --> 01:01:00.750
to be in the excited state.

01:01:00.750 --> 01:01:06.080
And this is now your estimator
for the excited state diagonal

01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:08.648
matrix element of
the density matrix.

01:01:08.648 --> 01:01:13.260
And if you-- If you've
written your code correctly,

01:01:13.260 --> 01:01:17.150
you will find that you get a
wonderful exponential decay

01:01:17.150 --> 01:01:18.960
exactly as you have expected.

01:01:29.475 --> 01:01:29.975
Questions?

01:01:35.350 --> 01:01:38.660
Now-- Yes?

01:01:38.660 --> 01:01:42.140
Let-- Let me now
talk about dephasing.

01:01:49.530 --> 01:01:53.410
What I've shown you so far is
how we can unravel the density

01:01:53.410 --> 01:01:56.530
matrix in many
microscopic realizations.

01:01:56.530 --> 01:01:59.280
And I've given you
a specific example.

01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:04.660
We assume probability
for spontaneous emission,

01:02:04.660 --> 01:02:07.790
and with that we propagate
our wave function.

01:02:07.790 --> 01:02:11.560
But now I come to, sort of,
the nitty gritty details,

01:02:11.560 --> 01:02:16.220
or the dirty truth, that what
we have assumed is by no means

01:02:16.220 --> 01:02:17.330
unique.

01:02:17.330 --> 01:02:20.910
And I want to explain it to
you first by reminding you

01:02:20.910 --> 01:02:25.080
of a very, very nice homework
assignment you have solved.

01:02:25.080 --> 01:02:28.600
And this was about we have
optical block equations

01:02:28.600 --> 01:02:30.810
for the density matrix,
and the dense --

01:02:30.810 --> 01:02:34.920
and the solution of the optical
block equation is that we have

01:02:34.920 --> 01:02:39.050
population damping
with a damping time t1.

01:02:39.050 --> 01:02:41.320
And the off diagonal
matrix elements

01:02:41.320 --> 01:02:44.370
are damped with a time t2.

01:02:44.370 --> 01:02:48.000
Remember if you've only
spontaneous emission t2

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.070
is 2 times t1.

01:02:50.070 --> 01:02:53.310
But we can have a lot of
other processes, which

01:02:53.310 --> 01:02:56.250
can lead to much,
much faster defacing

01:02:56.250 --> 01:02:59.990
time than the population, than
the time of population changes.

01:02:59.990 --> 01:03:04.850
And in your homework, you have
discussed three possibilities.

01:03:04.850 --> 01:03:10.680
One is, well, spontaneous
emission is energy loss.

01:03:10.680 --> 01:03:14.690
But you have discussed three
different possibilities for t2.

01:03:14.690 --> 01:03:17.620
One-- Three different
possibilities

01:03:17.620 --> 01:03:20.500
how dephasing, loss of
coherence, and phase damping

01:03:20.500 --> 01:03:22.030
can happen.

01:03:22.030 --> 01:03:25.980
And in this homework
assignment, you assumed either

01:03:25.980 --> 01:03:29.810
that there is a random phase,
that the elastic collision

01:03:29.810 --> 01:03:32.400
which project onto
the excited state,

01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:35.560
and then you got the most
crazy and artificial model.

01:03:35.560 --> 01:03:40.430
That every time, randomly,
the phase of the excited state

01:03:40.430 --> 01:03:44.040
flips form plus to minus.

01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:48.990
So if I would implement that
now, with a quantum Monte Carlo

01:03:48.990 --> 01:03:52.470
method, it would have
the following affect.

01:03:52.470 --> 01:03:56.080
And I hope you enjoy, sort of,
the graphical representation.

01:03:56.080 --> 01:03:58.620
You can really think about
it, that this is what happens.

01:03:58.620 --> 01:04:01.300
That this is what inside--
what is inside the density

01:04:01.300 --> 01:04:03.820
matrices described
by this process.

01:04:03.820 --> 01:04:08.420
So let's assume we
have a system, which

01:04:08.420 --> 01:04:11.410
would be in a superposition
of ground and excited state.

01:04:11.410 --> 01:04:13.430
And that would mean
that in the left frame

01:04:13.430 --> 01:04:16.770
the dipole moment would
just rotate at the resonance

01:04:16.770 --> 01:04:17.870
frequency.

01:04:17.870 --> 01:04:20.810
It rotates, and it is a
rotating dipole moment,

01:04:20.810 --> 01:04:23.810
which emits coherent light.

01:04:23.810 --> 01:04:26.630
But now you assume that
you have a random phase.

01:04:26.630 --> 01:04:28.880
So if you add
random phases to it,

01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:33.140
maybe because you're
fluctuating magnetic fields,

01:04:33.140 --> 01:04:36.520
then the line becomes sort
of-- That doesn't look random,

01:04:36.520 --> 01:04:37.620
but you know what I mean.

01:04:37.620 --> 01:04:39.120
It becomes sort of jagged.

01:04:39.120 --> 01:04:41.710
The phase distribution
is still sort of there,

01:04:41.710 --> 01:04:43.630
but there is a
jitter on top of it.

01:04:43.630 --> 01:04:46.630
And as a result, the light
emitted by this dipole

01:04:46.630 --> 01:04:51.320
is spectrally broadened

01:04:51.320 --> 01:04:54.680
Well in your second
model you assumed

01:04:54.680 --> 01:04:58.400
that-- with a
certain randomness,

01:04:58.400 --> 01:05:00.140
with a certain time
constant-- there's

01:05:00.140 --> 01:05:02.720
an elastic collision in
the excited state, which

01:05:02.720 --> 01:05:05.210
projects the system
into the excited state.

01:05:05.210 --> 01:05:08.360
At this moment there is no
superposition state anymore,

01:05:08.360 --> 01:05:11.350
and the dipole moment is 0.

01:05:11.350 --> 01:05:12.790
So that's what you assume.

01:05:12.790 --> 01:05:15.100
Or when you have
random phase flips,

01:05:15.100 --> 01:05:18.730
you assumed that
suddenly this kind

01:05:18.730 --> 01:05:21.350
of data to data
ministic sine function

01:05:21.350 --> 01:05:27.600
suddenly jumps corresponding
to a minus sign in the excited

01:05:27.600 --> 01:05:28.160
state.

01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:30.410
And depending where
you are in the cycle,

01:05:30.410 --> 01:05:32.430
it creates jumps
at random places.

01:05:39.660 --> 01:05:45.295
And the question of course is,
if all those three processes--

01:05:45.295 --> 01:05:48.400
and that's what you showed
in your homework-- lead

01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:52.810
to the same density matrix,
which one is correct?

01:05:52.810 --> 01:05:55.550
Which one is real--
is really realized

01:05:55.550 --> 01:06:00.090
in an experiment on a
system which is described

01:06:00.090 --> 01:06:02.640
by this kind of damping, or
by the optical block equation?

01:06:06.860 --> 01:06:11.380
So you can say all or none.

01:06:11.380 --> 01:06:13.670
Well you can assume
what you want,

01:06:13.670 --> 01:06:15.690
it doesn't make a difference.

01:06:15.690 --> 01:06:17.210
And the reason is
actually profound.

01:06:20.210 --> 01:06:22.970
The reason-- The reason
is profound in that sense

01:06:22.970 --> 01:06:28.250
that the way-- our goal
was to have an open quantum

01:06:28.250 --> 01:06:32.380
system, which is the
atomic system, interacting

01:06:32.380 --> 01:06:34.620
with a reservoir.

01:06:34.620 --> 01:06:36.720
But the way, how we
phrase the question,

01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:39.800
we are only interested in
what the atomic system does.

01:06:39.800 --> 01:06:42.640
We didn't do extra measurements
on the environment.

01:06:42.640 --> 01:06:46.760
The environment was just a dump
for photons; a dump for energy;

01:06:46.760 --> 01:06:51.040
a dump for whatever we assumed
in our dephasing mechanism.

01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:54.590
So let me just take the
example of putting photons

01:06:54.590 --> 01:06:56.450
into the environment.

01:06:56.450 --> 01:06:59.490
And this is described by
a certain damping term,

01:06:59.490 --> 01:07:01.940
but there is an ambiguity.

01:07:01.940 --> 01:07:05.580
And this is shown here.

01:07:05.580 --> 01:07:14.140
If you evolve the system-- our,
our atomic system, the density

01:07:14.140 --> 01:07:18.570
matrix evolves, but the
environment sort of also

01:07:18.570 --> 01:07:19.090
evolves.

01:07:19.090 --> 01:07:22.200
And for instance here,
the unitary time evolution

01:07:22.200 --> 01:07:24.720
has taken the excitation
from the atom,

01:07:24.720 --> 01:07:27.470
and we have emitted a
photon into the environment.

01:07:27.470 --> 01:07:30.370
And you remember we got
the optical block equation

01:07:30.370 --> 01:07:33.190
by doing the partial trace
here, and just focusing

01:07:33.190 --> 01:07:35.650
on the atomic part.

01:07:35.650 --> 01:07:37.930
But now wait a moment.

01:07:37.930 --> 01:07:41.560
If we trace out
the environment, we

01:07:41.560 --> 01:07:45.350
can trace it out in a
different basis set.

01:07:45.350 --> 01:07:47.740
Remember, I showed you the
quantum Monte Carlo wave

01:07:47.740 --> 01:07:49.900
function, we emit a photon.

01:07:49.900 --> 01:07:53.510
But we can, for instance,
detect the photon

01:07:53.510 --> 01:07:55.400
in our gedanken experiment.

01:07:55.400 --> 01:07:57.475
We can detect it with
linear polarization

01:07:57.475 --> 01:07:59.830
or with circular polarization.

01:07:59.830 --> 01:08:03.560
If you have a situation where
you have a-- an s state, which

01:08:03.560 --> 01:08:07.990
decays to a p state, sigma plus
takes you to m equals plus 1,

01:08:07.990 --> 01:08:10.820
sigma minus takes you
to m equals minus 1.

01:08:10.820 --> 01:08:14.330
So therefore, if photon is
emitted in you quantum Monte

01:08:14.330 --> 01:08:17.390
Carlo procedure, you would
say, now the atom mean

01:08:17.390 --> 01:08:19.470
is in the plus 1
state, or now the atom

01:08:19.470 --> 01:08:21.189
is in the minus 1 state.

01:08:21.189 --> 01:08:24.340
But if you detect
linearly polarized light,

01:08:24.340 --> 01:08:26.229
by just putting a
polarizer here--

01:08:26.229 --> 01:08:28.850
and this is a unitary
transformation in front

01:08:28.850 --> 01:08:31.750
of your detector-- you
would no longer project

01:08:31.750 --> 01:08:34.990
the atomic system on
plus 1 at minus 1,

01:08:34.990 --> 01:08:36.760
you would project
it on m equals 0

01:08:36.760 --> 01:08:39.900
or whatever is connected
to the linear polarization

01:08:39.900 --> 01:08:41.790
of the measurement.

01:08:41.790 --> 01:08:44.510
So therefore, if
you simply assume

01:08:44.510 --> 01:08:46.720
that something has been
dumped in the environment,

01:08:46.720 --> 01:08:49.359
and can be used for
measurement, there

01:08:49.359 --> 01:08:52.680
are many ways, many
unitary transformations,

01:08:52.680 --> 01:08:56.580
what you can do to the
information, to the energy,

01:08:56.580 --> 01:08:59.609
to the photons, which have been
dumped into the environment.

01:08:59.609 --> 01:09:04.640
And each of them will lead to
a very different trajectory

01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:07.590
in your quantum
Monte Carlo system.

01:09:07.590 --> 01:09:09.870
So therefore if you
just dump the photons

01:09:09.870 --> 01:09:12.390
and not measure them,
you have equal rights

01:09:12.390 --> 01:09:15.990
to assume that your quantum
Monte Carlo wave function jumps

01:09:15.990 --> 01:09:19.479
to states which correspond
to a circular basis,

01:09:19.479 --> 01:09:23.540
or jump to states which
correspond to linear basis.

01:09:23.540 --> 01:09:26.649
And there's many,
many possibilities.

01:09:26.649 --> 01:09:33.649
But each of those possibilities
is 100% correct unravelling

01:09:33.649 --> 01:09:35.970
of the density matrix.

01:09:35.970 --> 01:09:40.330
And if you just do it right,
assume that the measurement is

01:09:40.330 --> 01:09:43.640
done in a certain basis, and
you're consistent with it,

01:09:43.640 --> 01:09:47.490
you will 100% correctly
describe the time evolution

01:09:47.490 --> 01:09:48.670
of your atomic system.

01:09:54.540 --> 01:09:56.243
Any questions?

01:09:56.243 --> 01:09:57.229
Philmore?

01:09:57.229 --> 01:09:59.201
AUDIENCE: Again with the dt.

01:09:59.201 --> 01:10:02.652
I'm just curious that we take
a [INAUDIBLE] very short,

01:10:02.652 --> 01:10:05.610
but why don't you
run into something

01:10:05.610 --> 01:10:07.582
like the quantum Zeno effect?

01:10:07.582 --> 01:10:10.211
Where if every evolution
is initially quadratic,

01:10:10.211 --> 01:10:13.730
like the [INAUDIBLE] frequency,
you take very short dt--

01:10:13.730 --> 01:10:17.420
short measuring system--
Shouldn't for a choice

01:10:17.420 --> 01:10:22.865
of sufficiently short dt you,
you know the simulation would

01:10:22.865 --> 01:10:25.580
give you strange
results, because of--

01:10:25.580 --> 01:10:26.330
PROFESSOR: [SIGHS]

01:10:26.330 --> 01:10:29.300
AUDIENCE: --some sort of
quantum Zeno effect there?

01:10:31.929 --> 01:10:33.970
PROFESSOR: That's a very
deep question, Philmore.

01:10:33.970 --> 01:10:36.600
And I, I want to
think about it more,

01:10:36.600 --> 01:10:40.310
but I think I've
excluded that by saying

01:10:40.310 --> 01:10:43.475
that the time step, dt, is
larger than the correlation

01:10:43.475 --> 01:10:45.470
time of the environment.

01:10:45.470 --> 01:10:48.560
So I'm doing some kind
of Markov approximation

01:10:48.560 --> 01:10:53.390
with the environment, where
s-- the quadratic part

01:10:53.390 --> 01:10:55.640
of the behavior
is a coherent time

01:10:55.640 --> 01:10:59.060
evolution, for very short time
steps a wave function evolves

01:10:59.060 --> 01:11:02.640
quadratically, but this part
is a coherent evolution.

01:11:02.640 --> 01:11:06.290
And that's related to the fact
that an atom can emit a photon,

01:11:06.290 --> 01:11:09.985
but in the very first
moment, before the vacuum

01:11:09.985 --> 01:11:13.330
has transported it away, it
can take the photon back.

01:11:13.330 --> 01:11:16.250
And the result of that is
that at very short times

01:11:16.250 --> 01:11:18.710
the exponential decay doesn't
start out exponentially,

01:11:18.710 --> 01:11:21.440
it starts out a
little bit flatter.

01:11:21.440 --> 01:11:24.480
We get the exponential decay,
we get Fermi's golden rule,

01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:28.242
and we get optical blocks
equations only if your time

01:11:28.242 --> 01:11:29.700
step is larger than
the correlation

01:11:29.700 --> 01:11:32.100
time of the reservoir.

01:11:32.100 --> 01:11:34.740
And the fact, you remember
when we derived the master

01:11:34.740 --> 01:11:39.230
equation we had to say we do
a step, which is sufficiently

01:11:39.230 --> 01:11:42.450
small for the dynamics
of the atomic system,

01:11:42.450 --> 01:11:46.980
but sufficiently large, that we
are not getting into any memory

01:11:46.980 --> 01:11:49.044
affects of the reservoir.

01:11:49.044 --> 01:11:50.710
And we've done the
same assumption here.

01:11:55.370 --> 01:11:57.580
Other questions?

01:11:57.580 --> 01:11:59.146
Nicky?

01:11:59.146 --> 01:12:00.146
AUDIENCE: Just confused.

01:12:00.146 --> 01:12:02.664
We are not always say
the environment measures

01:12:02.664 --> 01:12:07.083
the system in range at
time intervals, delta t,

01:12:07.083 --> 01:12:11.993
which are large compared
to the correlation time?

01:12:11.993 --> 01:12:18.376
What's more [INAUDIBLE]
the evolution of the atom.

01:12:18.376 --> 01:12:21.813
But now everyone isn't
that defected the Markov

01:12:21.813 --> 01:12:28.210
approximation we've made when
we derived the master equation?

01:12:28.210 --> 01:12:33.220
And I was just wondering
for just-- [INAUDIBLE]

01:12:33.220 --> 01:12:35.560
did you derive it by
making the master equation?

01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:37.854
Maybe we don't
actually need-- Maybe

01:12:37.854 --> 01:12:40.722
we don't need the idea
of constantly measuring.

01:12:40.722 --> 01:12:45.084
Maybe a physical interpretation
of the Markov approximation.

01:12:45.084 --> 01:12:46.500
PROFESSOR: Oh yes,
exactly, Nicky.

01:12:46.500 --> 01:12:50.010
I still think you said it
really very, very nicely.

01:12:50.010 --> 01:12:52.300
We derived a master
equation just

01:12:52.300 --> 01:12:57.540
by assuming that the system,
you know, takes a photon.

01:12:57.540 --> 01:13:00.050
And past the correlation
time, the photon

01:13:00.050 --> 01:13:02.700
is taken for good
by the environment.

01:13:02.700 --> 01:13:05.870
And with a Markov
approximation, we formalized

01:13:05.870 --> 01:13:09.540
that there is no memory
affect, the photon

01:13:09.540 --> 01:13:11.340
is not stored like in a cavity.

01:13:11.340 --> 01:13:13.290
The photon has disappeared.

01:13:13.290 --> 01:13:15.940
And by saying that this
time is very short,

01:13:15.940 --> 01:13:18.945
this was a Markov approximation
in the derivation of the master

01:13:18.945 --> 01:13:20.240
equation.

01:13:20.240 --> 01:13:24.780
But that also means, if
the photon has disappeared,

01:13:24.780 --> 01:13:27.050
has separated from
the atomic system,

01:13:27.050 --> 01:13:30.500
we are now free to
make a measurement.

01:13:30.500 --> 01:13:31.910
And of course it
shouldn't matter

01:13:31.910 --> 01:13:34.840
whether we make the
measurement or not.

01:13:34.840 --> 01:13:37.280
But what I was able
to do today is,

01:13:37.280 --> 01:13:39.870
I was making now the
assumption, let's assume

01:13:39.870 --> 01:13:41.180
we make a measurement.

01:13:41.180 --> 01:13:43.610
We measure all the photons
which have been emitted,

01:13:43.610 --> 01:13:46.320
and the measurement
is probabilistic.

01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:50.080
And we fold this
probabilistic evolution

01:13:50.080 --> 01:13:51.890
into our quantum system.

01:13:51.890 --> 01:13:56.330
And what we obtained was
exactly the same time evolution

01:13:56.330 --> 01:14:00.890
for the density matrix as we
got from the master equation.

01:14:00.890 --> 01:14:02.610
So in other words,
this should you

01:14:02.610 --> 01:14:05.190
that interactions
with an open quantum

01:14:05.190 --> 01:14:10.090
system, where irreversibly
energy, photons, angular

01:14:10.090 --> 01:14:13.200
momentum, or whatever--
flows into the environment.

01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:16.200
Once it has flown
into the environment,

01:14:16.200 --> 01:14:17.590
you can measure it.

01:14:17.590 --> 01:14:20.160
And you get all the stochastics
from the measurement.

01:14:20.160 --> 01:14:21.900
But even if you
don't measure it,

01:14:21.900 --> 01:14:23.880
you get exactly the
same stochastics as

01:14:23.880 --> 01:14:24.910
if you had measured it.

01:14:24.910 --> 01:14:27.122
It's all the same.

01:14:27.122 --> 01:14:27.622
Jenny?

01:14:27.622 --> 01:14:28.110
AUDIENCE: Now that
I think about it,

01:14:28.110 --> 01:14:31.038
it seems sort of weird to me
that we've-- that we're making

01:14:31.038 --> 01:14:32.990
these measurements, or
lack of measurements,

01:14:32.990 --> 01:14:36.403
these interactions,
at regular intervals.

01:14:36.403 --> 01:14:37.140
And not--

01:14:37.140 --> 01:14:38.640
PROFESSOR: It doesn't
really matter.

01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:41.190
All we-- All we
have to make is--

01:14:41.190 --> 01:14:43.940
You could actually make
delta t a random variable.

01:14:43.940 --> 01:14:45.672
It wouldn't change anything.

01:14:45.672 --> 01:14:47.130
The only thing we
have to make sure

01:14:47.130 --> 01:14:50.300
is we have to make the
time interval short enough

01:14:50.300 --> 01:14:54.150
that we don't have, maybe, two
photons emitted in that time.

01:14:54.150 --> 01:14:55.810
We just want to
make sure that it's

01:14:55.810 --> 01:15:00.639
a simple probabilistic
branching, yes or no.

01:15:00.639 --> 01:15:02.180
And that's the only
requirement here.

01:15:08.470 --> 01:15:10.595
AUDIENCE: Is this a formula
or is it based on time?

01:15:10.595 --> 01:15:12.219
You say that would
be the wave function

01:15:12.219 --> 01:15:13.565
evolving and then collapse.

01:15:13.565 --> 01:15:19.505
And that's-- This is what--
Where the measurement comes in.

01:15:19.505 --> 01:15:21.485
The equivalent, so now
say, the equivalent

01:15:21.485 --> 01:15:23.960
is a wave function
evolved in a collapse,

01:15:23.960 --> 01:15:26.435
when you make a measurement
you say that after it evolves.

01:15:26.435 --> 01:15:28.910
So is it possible
that it could also

01:15:28.910 --> 01:15:32.375
have-- like evolves
some kind of formalism?

01:15:32.375 --> 01:15:33.860
Like this?

01:15:33.860 --> 01:15:36.335
Where there is an operator?

01:15:36.335 --> 01:15:39.800
Because still like even though
the density matrix operator,

01:15:39.800 --> 01:15:42.740
maybe it is kind of like--
[INAUDIBLE] describes a state.

01:15:50.620 --> 01:15:52.160
PROFESSOR: I haven't
seen it, Mark,

01:15:52.160 --> 01:15:55.230
but I'm absolutely certain
that you could describe

01:15:55.230 --> 01:15:57.810
the same physics in
the Heisenberg picture,

01:15:57.810 --> 01:16:00.020
where the time evolution
is with operators.

01:16:00.020 --> 01:16:03.780
Because what we have here is,
we have a time step, delta t,

01:16:03.780 --> 01:16:07.420
where the system evolves as
an isolated quantum system,

01:16:07.420 --> 01:16:09.200
and then we measure again.

01:16:09.200 --> 01:16:12.870
And so, I think if you
would use operator equation,

01:16:12.870 --> 01:16:16.770
you would have an
evolution of the operator

01:16:16.770 --> 01:16:22.250
with the same Hamiltonian, which
is non-emission Hamiltonian.

01:16:22.250 --> 01:16:25.775
And then the measurement would
do some form of projection.

01:16:25.775 --> 01:16:28.160
I have to think about it,
what the projection would

01:16:28.160 --> 01:16:29.700
be in terms of operators.

01:16:29.700 --> 01:16:37.150
But my gut feeling is, you can
always take the transformation

01:16:37.150 --> 01:16:39.390
where you put the time
dependence into the operators,

01:16:39.390 --> 01:16:41.170
and not in the wave function.

01:16:41.170 --> 01:16:43.870
On the other hand, I have
some little bit misgivings

01:16:43.870 --> 01:16:46.460
about that, because the quantum
Monte Carlo wave function

01:16:46.460 --> 01:16:51.380
was really developed in order
not to deal with matrices,

01:16:51.380 --> 01:16:54.810
not to deal with something
which is dimension n times in,

01:16:54.810 --> 01:16:57.550
if n is the number of
components of the wave function.

01:16:57.550 --> 01:17:00.760
It was specifically formulated
to have the simpler description

01:17:00.760 --> 01:17:02.720
with n coefficients
for the wave function.

01:17:02.720 --> 01:17:07.790
But conceptually, I
think, it is evolution

01:17:07.790 --> 01:17:09.560
with a Hamiltonian measurement.

01:17:09.560 --> 01:17:11.530
Evolution with a
Hamiltonian measurement.

01:17:11.530 --> 01:17:16.670
And I assume this could
also be done with operators.

01:17:16.670 --> 01:17:17.250
Nancy?

01:17:17.250 --> 01:17:20.112
AUDIENCE: Suddenly like
[INAUDIBLE] but when

01:17:20.112 --> 01:17:22.840
we've-- these simulations
are actively done,

01:17:22.840 --> 01:17:25.846
how important is the randomness?

01:17:25.846 --> 01:17:31.921
Like up to epsilon [INAUDIBLE]
because no computer is actually

01:17:31.921 --> 01:17:32.920
emitting random numbers.

01:17:36.110 --> 01:17:39.370
PROFESSOR: Well I think how
random a random number has

01:17:39.370 --> 01:17:42.940
to be is really dealt
with in computer science

01:17:42.940 --> 01:17:43.830
and mathematics.

01:17:43.830 --> 01:17:45.318
AUDIENCE: But due
to our reserves

01:17:45.318 --> 01:17:47.798
we always get this
exponential behavior?

01:17:52.812 --> 01:17:54.270
PROFESSOR: I don't
know the answer.

01:17:54.270 --> 01:17:55.950
I mean here,
conceptionally, it should

01:17:55.950 --> 01:17:58.330
be completely random number.

01:17:58.330 --> 01:18:02.560
And I think that algorithms,
which even which produce

01:18:02.560 --> 01:18:07.070
pseudo random numbers, but if
the pseudo is close enough,

01:18:07.070 --> 01:18:09.940
if there is a recurrence
time of your random number--

01:18:09.940 --> 01:18:12.640
if your random number--
your series of random number

01:18:12.640 --> 01:18:18.380
repeat itself after several
billion random numbers,

01:18:18.380 --> 01:18:20.230
this gives you a
small error bar.

01:18:20.230 --> 01:18:23.580
And if you don't-- If you'd
only do a limited sampling,

01:18:23.580 --> 01:18:25.930
a limited number of
time trajectories,

01:18:25.930 --> 01:18:27.350
I don't think it matters.

01:18:27.350 --> 01:18:29.940
Of course if you want to
have ultimate precision,

01:18:29.940 --> 01:18:32.245
then also the precision
of the random number

01:18:32.245 --> 01:18:34.120
may enter through the
backdoor at some point.

01:18:36.845 --> 01:18:48.485
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
lack of simulation

01:18:48.485 --> 01:18:52.616
of the photons emitted?

01:18:52.616 --> 01:18:54.560
But if we know the
photons emitted,

01:18:54.560 --> 01:19:00.880
if we have that information,
then we can decide [INAUDIBLE].

01:19:00.880 --> 01:19:02.260
PROFESSOR: That's correct.

01:19:02.260 --> 01:19:14.440
If we-- If we would know--
If we would know more

01:19:14.440 --> 01:19:16.490
about the environment,
if we would

01:19:16.490 --> 01:19:19.970
say we measured the
photons in a certain basis,

01:19:19.970 --> 01:19:23.140
or when energy is dumped
in the environment

01:19:23.140 --> 01:19:26.940
by a dephasing mechanism,
we look at the environment.

01:19:26.940 --> 01:19:31.070
Then, of course, we would
add extra information to it,

01:19:31.070 --> 01:19:34.310
and then certain
quantum trajectories

01:19:34.310 --> 01:19:37.190
would reflect the extra
knowledge we have.

01:19:37.190 --> 01:19:39.870
And of course, we would
then describe everything

01:19:39.870 --> 01:19:41.400
in this basis.

01:19:41.400 --> 01:19:43.240
On the other hand,
what you should

01:19:43.240 --> 01:19:47.490
learn from this is once the
information, once the photon

01:19:47.490 --> 01:19:51.140
has escaped, it doesn't
matter for the time evolution

01:19:51.140 --> 01:19:55.220
of your atomic system, in which
basis you measure the photon.

01:19:55.220 --> 01:19:58.870
So the evolution of the
atomic system itself--

01:19:58.870 --> 01:20:05.320
at least when you averaged--
is unaffected by the basis.

01:20:05.320 --> 01:20:08.040
However if you make a
coincidence measurement,

01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:10.430
that you say your atoms
which has emitted,

01:20:10.430 --> 01:20:12.700
is still flying through
your vacuum chamber,

01:20:12.700 --> 01:20:14.540
and now you figure
out the photon

01:20:14.540 --> 01:20:17.150
is emitted as circularly
polarized light.

01:20:17.150 --> 01:20:20.590
Then of course you know that
this atom, which is still

01:20:20.590 --> 01:20:23.592
available, has emitted
circularly polarized light.

01:20:23.592 --> 01:20:25.800
And then you have actually
obtained extra information

01:20:25.800 --> 01:20:27.540
about your atom.

01:20:27.540 --> 01:20:29.850
In other words, the
photon in the atom

01:20:29.850 --> 01:20:32.760
was entangled, like a Bell pair.

01:20:32.760 --> 01:20:36.020
And if you now do a measurement
on one part of the Bell pair,

01:20:36.020 --> 01:20:38.190
you know more about
the other part.

01:20:38.190 --> 01:20:40.190
But this is just how
quantum physics works.

01:20:40.190 --> 01:20:42.870
If you don't use this
information for anything,

01:20:42.870 --> 01:20:46.840
then you could have-- you
could have as well not measured

01:20:46.840 --> 01:20:47.685
the polarization.

01:20:47.685 --> 01:20:51.707
And it would have no effect
on the atomic density matrix.

01:20:56.580 --> 01:20:58.290
OK that's it for today.

01:20:58.290 --> 01:21:01.660
We have class at the
usual time on Wednesday.

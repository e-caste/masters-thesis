WEBVTT

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.120
PROFESSOR: Let me begin by
introducing the subject.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.646
The subject is resonances.

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:18.510
And we have seen,
actually, a little bit

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.800
of this in the
resonant transmission

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.040
of the Ramsauer-Townsend effect.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.440
Because of a
resonance phenomenon

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:34.080
within the square well
obstacle, somehow,

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:39.060
for some particular frequencies,
for some particular energies,

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:43.890
the particles were able to
zoom by without experiencing

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.620
any reflection, whatsoever.

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.550
So let's begin the
subject of resonances

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.450
by asking a question.

00:00:54.450 --> 00:01:01.410
If you have the usual potential,
the short range potential,

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.850
which means, that for some
distance, R, greater than 0,

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.150
the potential is 0.

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.920
Here we put a barrier,
and over there

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:18.100
could be anything,
some potential.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.880
We've computed some-- this
concept of time delay,

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.130
there's a formula
for the time delay.

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:34.890
In fact, it was given by 2 h
bar d delta dE, the time delay,

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.640
2 h bar d delta dE.

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:49.210
And we discussed that this
time delay can be positive

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.166
or it can be negative.

00:01:52.166 --> 00:01:55.560
If it's positive, it
really means a time delay.

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.140
You send in a wave packet.

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.130
And it takes time to come
back, more time than it

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.150
would have taken if there
had been no potential.

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.025
You see, the time delay,
you have a packet coming

00:02:08.025 --> 00:02:11.060
in from time minus infinity.

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.130
And then it bounces back
a time equal infinity.

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.930
But nevertheless, you
compare that with a situation

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.320
in which there's no potential.

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.050
And you see that there
is some time delay.

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.000
If you time the wave packet
to reach at time equals 0,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.360
here, it will not reach back
to where you were by time--

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.600
by whatever time-- suppose
you have the wave packet here

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.400
at t equal minus 10, then
it goes here, and it delays,

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.830
and at t equal 10, the
packet has not reached,

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.844
there is a time delay,
a positive time delay.

00:02:47.844 --> 00:02:53.090
A negative time delay
is the opposite.

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.450
The packet arrives
a little earlier.

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.870
And the question
I want to ask you,

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:03.540
if you have a
negative time delay,

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.930
can it be arbitrarily large.

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:12.260
Well, if you send
in a wave packet,

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.530
it may find an infinite wall
here, and then may bounce,

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.460
and then yes, it
comes back earlier

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:22.180
than you expected, because
the free packet would

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:23.930
have gone here and back.

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:27.620
But you wouldn't expect it
to be able to come earlier

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:30.740
than if there was an
infinite wall here,

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:32.580
because there is no
infinite wall here,

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:33.770
nor an infinite wall here.

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:39.520
So it's just not going to
bounce before it reaches here.

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:42.110
The best it can do is
bounce when it reaches here.

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:45.950
So you should not expect,
and this, sometimes,

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:48.870
will [INAUDIBLE],
there is nothing

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.950
that can make it bounce
until you reach here.

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:57.370
So you cannot expect that the
time advance is larger as if it

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.396
would have bounced before
reaching the obstacle,

00:04:01.396 --> 00:04:04.580
whatsoever.

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:05.750
So this is important.

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:10.610
We cannot have a negative time
delay that this infinitely

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:11.200
large.

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:17.930
So, in fact, the time delay
as, we're right in here,

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:22.790
should be greater than
the total travel distance

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:23.710
that you may save.

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:31.320
If you bounce here, you
would save 2R over v.

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:34.900
And you must be greater than
that negative number, which

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.800
is the total travel
time that it would take

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.440
to go back and forth, here.

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:45.440
So we can do a little
arithmetic, here.

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:56.555
This is equal to 2 h bar d
delta dk, and here, dE dk.

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:06.380
This is still greater than or
equal than minus 2R over v.

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:10.635
And I want to put a sim, because
our argument is not completely

00:05:10.635 --> 00:05:16.730
rigorous as to what's
happening when it reaches here.

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:19.210
It seems very
plausible classically,

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:21.830
but there's a bit
of a correction

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:24.860
if you do it exactly.

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:29.400
So it's not an exact
inequality we're deriving.

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:36.650
And what is the E dk is
h bar times the velocity.

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:45.115
Remember, dE dk, you
are differentiating

00:05:45.115 --> 00:05:48.640
h squared k squared over 2m.

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:55.430
And you get h bar
times hk over m.

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:59.140
So therefore, this is
h bar and the velocity.

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:01.010
And the h bars cancel.

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:02.475
The velocities cancel.

00:06:02.475 --> 00:06:05.860
Between these two
sides, the 2s cancel.

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:13.290
And you'll get that d delta dk
must be greater than or equal,

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:18.005
approximately, to R.

00:06:18.005 --> 00:06:21.020
And that's sometimes
called Wigner's condition

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:23.390
on scattering.

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:26.480
And it basically is the
idea that the time delay,

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:29.240
the time advance
cannot be too large.

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:32.940
OK, so now we can ask
the second question.

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:38.405
How about the time
delay, a true time delay,

00:06:38.405 --> 00:06:40.350
can it be very large?

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:42.810
Can it be arbitrarily large?

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:46.493
Suppose we have a
barrier of this form.

00:06:46.493 --> 00:06:50.520
And now you send a particle
with a little bit higher energy

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:51.650
here.

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:53.950
Now, this particle
is going to have

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:55.130
very little kinetic energy.

00:06:55.130 --> 00:07:01.250
So it's going to travel quite
slowly here, and go back.

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:07.130
And this time, it's going to
delay quite a bit, probably.

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:09.740
But the problem is, if you
create-- there's nothing

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:12.950
very peculiar about this,
if you go a little lower,

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:16.870
than you're advanced, and then
suddenly, it gets delayed.

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:21.560
It's not that evident, but
the phenomenon of resonance

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:28.230
is precisely what we get when
we, sort of, trap the particle.

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:34.060
And then we make it be, as far
as it seems, arbitrarily large,

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:37.200
if you design a well properly.

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:39.710
But the thing that
we have to design,

00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:42.410
the example of what
we're going to design,

00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:46.840
is different from all the
things I've drawn so far.

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:50.860
It's the following way,
this is just an example.

00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:57.875
I have this zero
line of the energy.

00:07:57.875 --> 00:08:00.910
This is v of x.

00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:02.706
This is x.

00:08:02.706 --> 00:08:06.440
And then I put an
attractive potential here.

00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:14.120
And here is minus v0.

00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:22.278
And then I put a
barrier here with a v1.

00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:29.280
So what I'm going to
aim at is, you see,

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:34.720
if v1 will be extremely
large, there will be--

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:37.700
well, if v0 is
extremely large, then

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:39.750
begin there would be
bound states here,

00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:42.830
but these are not
scattering states.

00:08:42.830 --> 00:08:46.440
On the other hand, if v1
will also be infinite,

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:48.340
you would have
bound states here,

00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:50.290
but they could not escape.

00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:53.610
So certainly, if I
combine these two,

00:08:53.610 --> 00:08:58.940
I put a v0 and
maybe a larger v1,

00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:01.720
I can almost create
bound states here.

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:03.960
But they're not
really bound states,

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:09.120
because they can leak out and
produce scattering states.

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:12.900
But these are going
to be resonances.

00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:16.410
This part and this,
this being a attractive,

00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:20.220
trying to keep the particle
in, and this being a barrier,

00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:26.210
can combine to produce a
state that gets trapped here,

00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:30.020
and stays a very long, time,
will have a very long time

00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:31.430
delay.

00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:34.290
And that's the
phenomenon of resonances.

00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:37.500
We need to trap that
particle, somehow.

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:42.460
And we're going to see now
the details of how this works,

00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:44.220
and what the properties are.

00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:49.060
Now, it's very interesting
that actually, these resonances

00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:53.286
occur at some
particular energies.

00:09:53.286 --> 00:09:55.660
And they have
different properties.

00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:58.895
But we can identify
energies of resonances.

00:09:58.895 --> 00:10:01.800
And these are not bound states.

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:03.270
They're just resonances.

00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:05.790
They eventually escape.

00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:10.560
And they're not normalizable,
really, but in some ways

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:14.440
they behave as bound
states for awhile.

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:20.590
They stay there for a
while and do nice things.

00:10:20.590 --> 00:10:24.810
So let's set this off.

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:30.750
Now we're going to
spare you a little bit

00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:34.550
of these calculations,
because the important thing is

00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:38.810
that you know how to set it
up, and if you get an answer,

00:10:38.810 --> 00:10:42.434
you know how to plot it,
how to get the units out,

00:10:42.434 --> 00:10:44.290
how to try to understand it.

00:10:44.290 --> 00:10:46.360
So that's what
we're going to do.

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:51.842
I'm going to put an
energy here, an energy, E.

00:10:51.842 --> 00:10:55.470
And I'm going to receive
E to be less than v1

00:10:55.470 --> 00:10:57.850
and greater than 0.

00:10:57.850 --> 00:11:05.020
I don't expect true
resonances beyond,

00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:07.540
because the particle
just bounces out.

00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:09.192
It doesn't get trapped.

00:11:09.192 --> 00:11:13.940
The phenomenon of resonance is a
little more intricate than just

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:16.140
having a long time delay.

00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:17.988
There's more that has to happen.

00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:22.855
Another thing that
will happen, is

00:11:22.855 --> 00:11:26.130
if the particle spends
a lot of time here,

00:11:26.130 --> 00:11:31.158
you would find, in this
spirit of resonance,

00:11:31.158 --> 00:11:34.450
that the amplitude
of the wave function

00:11:34.450 --> 00:11:39.040
here is going to be very big.

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:41.420
So you will scan the
energy and the amplitude.

00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:43.590
It will be normal,
normal, normal.

00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:47.854
And suddenly for some
energy it becomes very big.

00:11:47.854 --> 00:11:50.870
And we're going to do that.

00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:53.650
The way I'm going to develop
that, we're going to calculate

00:11:53.650 --> 00:11:55.592
this, plot these things.

00:11:55.592 --> 00:11:57.990
And then we are going
to ask whether there

00:11:57.990 --> 00:12:03.830
is a mathematical condition
that picks resonances.

00:12:03.830 --> 00:12:08.230
Well, how do I, if I want
to explain to somebody in 30

00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:11.200
seconds where are
the resonances,

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:16.680
how do you calculate them, you
cannot tell that somebody, OK,

00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:20.590
calculate it for all
energies, do all the plots,

00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:24.985
and see some peak in some
thing, and this is a resonance.

00:12:24.985 --> 00:12:26.860
This is what we're going
to do to begin with,

00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:30.130
but then we'll get
more sophisticated.

00:12:30.130 --> 00:12:32.145
So let's put k in.

00:12:32.145 --> 00:12:39.330
So let's call this k prime,
the wave number in this area.

00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:44.050
Kappa here, because it's
a forbidden region, and k

00:12:44.050 --> 00:12:46.980
over here, as usual.

00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:54.310
So k squared is 2mE
over h bar squared.

00:12:54.310 --> 00:13:00.950
K prime squared is equal to
2m, the total kinetic energy

00:13:00.950 --> 00:13:07.300
is E plus v0, over h squared.

00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:13.705
And kappa squared is again,
similar formula, but this time

00:13:13.705 --> 00:13:18.130
is the energy differential
between v1 and E,

00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:24.460
so 2m v1 minus E over h squared.

00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:26.830
All of these three
numbers are positive.

00:13:26.830 --> 00:13:29.560
And they are the
relevant constants

00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:31.386
to write wave functions.

00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:37.095
So we have to write
a wave function.

00:13:37.095 --> 00:13:38.920
And I'm going to
write a wave function

00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:41.950
because it takes
a little tinkering

00:13:41.950 --> 00:13:44.270
to do it in an efficient way.

00:13:47.974 --> 00:13:50.300
There is one that you
don't have to think,

00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:52.500
you just have to remember.

00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:53.970
It's the one outside.

00:13:53.970 --> 00:13:58.920
It's the universal
formula, e to the i delta

00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:13.570
sine kx plus delta is valid
for for x greater than R.

00:14:13.570 --> 00:14:17.000
This one we derived at the
beginning of our analysis

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.470
of scattering.

00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:22.060
How about the other region.

00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:23.920
Oops, I should have
put letters here.

00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:30.120
These are a and 2a
they are positions.

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:34.670
And therefore,
it's not R in here.

00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:38.610
Well, it's R, it's the range of
the potential, but here is 2a.

00:14:44.110 --> 00:14:45.826
How about the other one?

00:14:45.826 --> 00:14:49.050
In this region, it's
kind of simple again.

00:14:49.050 --> 00:14:51.790
The wave function has to
vanish here, has to be

00:14:51.790 --> 00:14:54.520
sines or cosines of k prime.

00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:57.970
So it has to be a sine
function of k prime.

00:14:57.970 --> 00:15:02.470
And since we don't put an
extra constant in here,

00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:04.550
we kind of put an
extra constant in here,

00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:10.573
there must be a constant
here, A sine of k prime x.

00:15:10.573 --> 00:15:15.850
And that must be for
x between 0 and a.

00:15:15.850 --> 00:15:18.450
We used k prime, the
wave from over there.

00:15:18.450 --> 00:15:23.080
And there is A. And what we
were saying about resonances,

00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:27.940
is that, well, A
may depend on k.

00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:30.145
And when you have
a resonance, A is

00:15:30.145 --> 00:15:34.380
going to [INAUDIBLE], presumably
because the particle spends

00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:39.350
a long time inside the well.

00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:43.600
And now I have to
write this one in here.

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:45.873
And this is the
one that, you can

00:15:45.873 --> 00:15:49.860
do it, do a little bit more
work, or do it kind of,

00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:52.196
efficiently.

00:15:52.196 --> 00:15:54.765
In that region we
have exponentials,

00:15:54.765 --> 00:15:59.444
like we have e to the kappa
x and e to the minus kappa x.

00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:08.926
Or I may want to have sinh
of kappa x and cosh of kappa

00:16:08.926 --> 00:16:11.295
x to write my solutions.

00:16:11.295 --> 00:16:13.930
But I actually don't
want either of them

00:16:13.930 --> 00:16:16.920
too much, because I
would like to write

00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:23.070
an answer that almost imposes
continuity in a nice way.

00:16:23.070 --> 00:16:37.190
So I could use sinh of kappa
x minus a and cosh of kappa x

00:16:37.190 --> 00:16:38.095
minus a.

00:16:38.095 --> 00:16:40.610
These are all solutions.

00:16:40.610 --> 00:16:43.130
You can choose
whichever pair you want.

00:16:46.490 --> 00:16:51.500
So for example, if I want
to implement continuity

00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:54.770
with this thing,
this wave function,

00:16:54.770 --> 00:16:56.615
I want to write
something that I don't

00:16:56.615 --> 00:16:59.290
have to write another
equation for continuity.

00:16:59.290 --> 00:17:08.210
So I will write A
sine of k prime a--

00:17:08.210 --> 00:17:11.839
so far, this wave
function, if x equal a,

00:17:11.839 --> 00:17:13.910
coincides with this one.

00:17:13.910 --> 00:17:17.369
But this is no wave function
yet, not with an x dependence,

00:17:17.369 --> 00:17:19.349
so I have to put more.

00:17:19.349 --> 00:17:24.589
But then, I know that cosh
is 1 for x equals zero.

00:17:24.589 --> 00:17:32.830
So I put here a cosh
kappa x minus a.

00:17:32.830 --> 00:17:39.470
And now this is a solution that
matches that one at x equals a.

00:17:39.470 --> 00:17:44.050
At x equal a, the cosh
becomes 1 and matches.

00:17:44.050 --> 00:17:46.400
But this kind of need
a complete solution.

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:47.600
It's not general enough.

00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:56.280
So you have to put a B
sinh of kappa x minus a.

00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:59.690
And this won't ruin the
matching, because at x equal a,

00:17:59.690 --> 00:18:01.670
that second term vanishes.

00:18:01.670 --> 00:18:05.780
So we're still
matching well there.

00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:09.060
And Well matching
here is non-trivial

00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:11.810
when I impose some conditions.

00:18:11.810 --> 00:18:16.010
So you still have to match
derivatives and do a little bit

00:18:16.010 --> 00:18:19.060
of work but not too much work.

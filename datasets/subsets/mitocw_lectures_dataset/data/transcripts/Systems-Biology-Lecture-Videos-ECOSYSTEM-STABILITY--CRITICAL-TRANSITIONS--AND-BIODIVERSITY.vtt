00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:25.290
PROFESSOR: Today, our goal
is to discuss some concepts

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:28.670
in this question of a kind of
population or ecosystem level

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:32.996
stability, resilience, and
associated sudden transitions

00:00:32.996 --> 00:00:33.620
in populations.

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.640
And something about
diversity of populations.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.540
We will revisit this
question of diversity

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.861
more on the last
class, where we're

00:00:47.861 --> 00:00:49.360
going to discuss
some of these ideas

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.090
from the neutral
theory in ecology,

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.350
but it'll be a bit
of a preview today.

00:00:59.027 --> 00:01:00.610
So what we're going
to do is start out

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:05.030
by just considering the dynamics
of just a single population,

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.810
where you have maybe a
one population that's

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.600
growing either logistically,
or via some cooperative kind

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:12.820
of dynamic.

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.380
So, single population.

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.530
And in here, we're going
to understand something

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.550
about this idea of
either logistic growth

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:24.030
as compared to something called
the Allee effect, whereby

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.720
the population has some
cooperative type dynamic.

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.920
So this is maybe logistic
versus the Allee effect.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.290
And try to understand
how this Allee effect can

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.010
lead to the sudden transitions
that you read about

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:39.390
in the review.

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.760
And then we'll say something
about the Lotka-Volterra

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:44.899
competition model.

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:46.440
So this is a slightly
different model

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.231
from the Lotka-Volterra
predator-prey model

00:01:48.231 --> 00:01:51.590
that we've all been
thinking about recently

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.000
over the last week or so.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.390
But it's again, kind
of the simplest model

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.000
you might write
down that captures

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.550
this idea of interactions
between species.

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:02.930
In particular,
competitive interactions.

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.580
Then at the end, and depending
on how much time we have,

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:10.830
we'll either finish it or not.

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.163
We'll talk about some these
non transitive interactions.

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.640
The so-called rock,
paper, scissors,

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.380
RPS type interactions.

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.380
And some of the
measurements that

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.120
have been made both in male
mating strategies in lizards

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.900
in the California mountains, as
well as kind of a rock, paper,

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.670
scissors type dynamic that
was explored experimentally

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.050
by Benjamin Kerr in the context
of bacterial toxin production,

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:41.160
or chemical warfare bacteria.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.800
And this subject
does come in a bit

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.060
into this question
of spatial structure,

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.960
and how spatial structure
may help facilitate

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.455
the stability of populations.

00:02:52.455 --> 00:02:54.830
So there's this idea of that
non-transitive interactions,

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:57.430
whether you have Rock, Paper,
Scissor type interactions,

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.810
may facilitate coexistence of
either genotypes or species.

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.460
But in some of these
studies, there's

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:06.899
an argument that sometimes
this non-transitive interaction

00:03:06.899 --> 00:03:08.690
may not be enough, but
then in the presence

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:11.190
of spatial structure,
maybe it does help.

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.640
On Thursday, the primary
topic of the class

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.650
will be trying to understand
the dynamics of populations

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.590
when their spatially extended.

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.537
So this will
transition naturally

00:03:21.537 --> 00:03:22.745
into the subject on Thursday.

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:30.350
Are there any questions
about where we are here?

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:32.930
Or administrative type issues?

00:03:35.597 --> 00:03:37.930
All right, so I just want to
make sure that we're first,

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:38.830
all on the same page.

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:40.490
We talk about logistic growth.

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:47.350
So we can think
about-- Well, what

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:51.910
are the simplest ways that we
might consider the population

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.570
dynamics of just a
single population.

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:57.660
Well, the logistic growth
is maybe the simplest model

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:03.000
you might write down, where the
population is at least bounded.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.520
And I might even-- Maybe
I'll even just first draw

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:10.960
exponential growth,
just so that we can--

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:15.320
The very simplest
thing you might do

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:18.240
is you might just
say that N dot might

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:20.290
be equal to some r times n.

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.760
In this case, if
we plotted gamma,

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:33.620
the per capita rate
of population growth,

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:37.280
this is just some line at r.

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.130
In this case, the population
grows exponentially.

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:44.490
And that that means
that if you plot

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:46.904
say the number as a
function of time, well

00:04:46.904 --> 00:04:48.320
it doesn't matter
where you start,

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:49.690
you always go to infinity.

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:50.460
Right?

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:58.870
Now we can compare this to the
logistic growth case, where

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:02.600
we just assume that
at low density,

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:06.190
indeed, we grow
exponentially at this rate r,

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:08.135
but then we have
a linear decrease

00:05:08.135 --> 00:05:09.810
in this per capita
rate of growth

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:11.890
as a function of density.

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:22.390
So we might write this as
something that looks like this.

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:25.756
In which case, if we write
this per capita growth

00:05:25.756 --> 00:05:28.130
rate of the population, as a
function of population size,

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:32.710
it starts out at r,
but then it goes to 0.

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:34.904
And indeed you, might
even if you'd like,

00:05:34.904 --> 00:05:37.070
you could say that it goes
down to a negative value.

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:39.069
So in that case, you could
start at a population

00:05:39.069 --> 00:05:42.500
size above the
carrying capacity k,

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:44.395
and you still come back down it.

00:05:51.132 --> 00:05:53.340
One of things that we want
to make sure we understand

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:58.460
is what the bifurcation
structure of these equations

00:05:58.460 --> 00:05:59.520
is going to look like.

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:01.360
In particular, we
can think about what

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:04.575
happens if we add some sort of
death rate to the population.

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:11.960
Right now, in this
case, a death rate

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:16.880
corresponds to is
something-- OK, we're looking

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:20.189
at the bifurcation diagram.

00:06:20.189 --> 00:06:21.730
What we're going to
do is we're going

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:23.750
to think about what
happens if you look

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:25.850
at the size of the population.

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:27.975
In the bifurcation diagram,
what we typically do is

00:06:27.975 --> 00:06:29.920
we look at the fixed points.

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:32.940
The fixed points
in n, as a function

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:34.430
of some external parameter.

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:36.950
And here, we might just
think about delta here

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:38.590
which is just some death rate.

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:45.905
The simplest way to
include this here would

00:06:45.905 --> 00:06:50.210
be to have a minus delta n.

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:52.575
So the idea is that
there's this population.

00:06:52.575 --> 00:06:56.054
It grows exponentially
at small sizes.

00:06:56.054 --> 00:06:57.970
As the population size
grows, it might run out

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:01.150
of nutrients or so, and that
limits its overall population

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:02.140
size.

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:04.300
Then, we can add
another term here

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:05.959
which is corresponding
to something

00:07:05.959 --> 00:07:07.500
about the quality
of the environment.

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:09.999
So this could be the amount of
hunting that is taking place,

00:07:09.999 --> 00:07:13.620
or it could be a
reflection of pollutants

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:15.069
in the environment or so.

00:07:15.069 --> 00:07:16.610
And what we want to
do is try to make

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:20.220
sure we understand how
the size of the population

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:22.910
will respond to some death rate.

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:30.980
Well maybe we'll go ahead
and do a verbal vote.

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:34.960
So in the review
that you guys read,

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:37.650
this was talking about
in these early warning

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:39.800
indicators in the context
of sudden transitions

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:41.950
and populations.

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:43.690
So this was saying
that whether you're

00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:47.830
looking at a population, or
an ecosystem, or maybe even

00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:49.900
other complex system,
such as climate regime

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:52.700
shifts, epileptic seizures,
and so forth, the authors were

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:55.840
arguing that in
response to a slowly

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:57.620
changing environmental
knob, the system

00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:01.730
can experience a sudden
transition in the state.

00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:04.910
Now, the question is here.

00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:08.140
And the sudden transitions
that they were describing,

00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:13.110
those were fold bifurcations,
or saddle-node bifurcations.

00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:14.560
Where there's a
sudden transition

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:16.040
in say, the equilibrium.

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:17.540
Size of the population
is a function

00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:21.050
of some external knob describing
the quality of the environment.

00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:25.530
So the question is
whether this population

00:08:25.530 --> 00:08:29.212
experiences such a full
bifurcation at least

00:08:29.212 --> 00:08:30.170
to a sudden transition.

00:08:34.169 --> 00:08:36.890
Do understand the question?

00:08:36.890 --> 00:08:42.085
I'll say fold bifurcation.

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:51.812
I'll let you guys vote, just
so you can use your cards.

00:08:51.812 --> 00:08:54.270
And this is a full bifurcation
as a function of this delta,

00:08:54.270 --> 00:08:55.770
which is death rate.

00:08:55.770 --> 00:08:57.110
Ready?

00:08:57.110 --> 00:08:59.895
Three, two, one.

00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:05.520
We have a majority
now that are saying

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:07.510
the answer is no,
this does not actually

00:09:07.510 --> 00:09:11.500
have a fold bifurcation.

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:13.270
And the reason for
that is that we

00:09:13.270 --> 00:09:17.580
can find the-- In the
absence of a death rate, what

00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:20.050
is the equilibrium
population size?

00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:23.650
k, right?

00:09:25.912 --> 00:09:28.370
Indeed, what's going to happen
is that as we add this death

00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:33.170
rate, we can just figure out,
OK well, the fixed points

00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:35.350
occur when N dots equal to zero.

00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:36.210
All of these things.

00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:38.491
There's an n here, we
can divide by that.

00:09:38.491 --> 00:09:40.490
Well we could just do it,
just so that we're all

00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:42.210
on the same page.

00:09:42.210 --> 00:09:43.210
So the fixed point.

00:09:46.874 --> 00:09:50.910
What we want to do is
set N dot equal to zero.

00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:59.320
That tells us that n times
r1 minus n over k minus delta

00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:00.740
is equal to 0.

00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:01.720
OK.

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:04.610
How many fixed points are there
going to be in the system?

00:10:04.610 --> 00:10:05.220
Two.

00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:09.540
Right, so indeed, this is N dot.

00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:14.059
So n equal to zero is going
to be one fixed point,

00:10:14.059 --> 00:10:15.600
but the other one
is going to be when

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:17.660
this thing is equal to zero.

00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:20.910
And so then we end up
with 1 minus n over k,

00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:23.190
is going to be equal
to some delta over r.

00:10:36.890 --> 00:10:39.100
So we can see that
this stable fixed point

00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:42.660
is going to decrease linearly
with this death rate delta.

00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:44.510
And it's just going to
go smoothly to zero.

00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:47.900
That's this key feature of
this bifurcation digraph.

00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:54.190
So what happens is that we come
down like this, and indeed,

00:10:54.190 --> 00:10:57.430
we could even continue this and
the bifurcation occurs here.

00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:02.410
We want to draw--
This corresponds

00:11:02.410 --> 00:11:03.640
to a stable fixed point.

00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:08.215
And a dashed line is unstable.

00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:18.550
In this case, this is the
stable and this is the unstable.

00:11:23.194 --> 00:11:24.610
So this thing here
is what's known

00:11:24.610 --> 00:11:26.095
as a trans-critical bifurcation.

00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:31.650
And it's a bifurcation because
the fixed points do something.

00:11:31.650 --> 00:11:34.030
In this case, they
exchange stability.

00:11:34.030 --> 00:11:38.610
So what happens is that
this thing becomes unstable,

00:11:38.610 --> 00:11:40.600
whereas the fixed
point at n equals

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:43.524
0 becomes a stable fixed point.

00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:52.630
So there's no tipping
point or sudden transition

00:11:52.630 --> 00:11:57.380
in this logistic growth as
you change the death rate.

00:11:57.380 --> 00:11:59.270
All right, you can think
of it as a situation

00:11:59.270 --> 00:12:01.190
here where the death
rate just kind of starts

00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:02.190
pulling this thing down.

00:12:06.590 --> 00:12:10.090
And this bifurcation occurs
when you pull it down--

00:12:10.090 --> 00:12:11.225
when delta is equal to r.

00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:24.050
And what this means is
that if you plot say,

00:12:24.050 --> 00:12:32.400
the number as a function
of time, for low delta,

00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:34.400
in particular, for delta
equal to zero then this

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:45.240
is your-- You come to
this equilibrium k.

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:48.350
Where as delta increases,
eventually you just

00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:51.660
get to a situation where all of,
regardless of where you start,

00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:52.300
you go extinct.

00:12:55.270 --> 00:12:58.770
Now, in many cases, we don't
draw what happens down here

00:12:58.770 --> 00:13:02.620
because n being less than
0 is not a physical thing.

00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:05.185
But it's useful to think
about it mathematically,

00:13:05.185 --> 00:13:07.685
because that's what tells you
that that was the bifurcation.

00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:16.750
Are there any questions
about where we are here?

00:13:21.530 --> 00:13:24.580
One thing that's valuable in
the case of-- well, in general--

00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:29.610
is to switch between the
algebraic characterization

00:13:29.610 --> 00:13:32.094
of the dynamics a system
and the graphical dynamics,

00:13:32.094 --> 00:13:34.260
because you end up seeing
different things depending

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:35.866
on how you do it.

00:13:35.866 --> 00:13:37.240
For the case of
the Allee effect,

00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:40.300
we're just going to look at
it and analyze it graphically,

00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:43.829
just because the equation
is a little bit cumbersome,

00:13:43.829 --> 00:13:45.745
and I think don't provide
very much intuition.

00:13:51.490 --> 00:13:55.530
What you can see is that
for the logistic growth,

00:13:55.530 --> 00:13:57.920
other individuals
in the population

00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:01.590
always decrease your
happiness as an individual.

00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:05.000
So if you imagine that you are
some member of this population,

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.770
and having more
members the population

00:14:06.770 --> 00:14:08.270
there is always
kind of bad for you,

00:14:08.270 --> 00:14:10.940
because it decreases
your growth rate.

00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:14.434
And to think about the
happiness of an individual, what

00:14:14.434 --> 00:14:16.100
you typically want
to do is divide by n,

00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:18.475
because you're thinking about
the per capita growth rate.

00:14:18.475 --> 00:14:20.880
So that's telling you
about the ability hat

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:22.380
you will have to reproduce.

00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:24.440
So what you did we do
is just divide by n.

00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:30.160
What you can see is that
per capita division, gamma,

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:32.910
is a monotonically decreasing
function of the population

00:14:32.910 --> 00:14:33.870
size.

00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:36.550
This is saying that more
individuals in the population

00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:39.410
just take up space,
resources, mate, something.

00:14:39.410 --> 00:14:42.510
And so you as an
individual never benefit

00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:44.970
from the presence of
other individuals.

00:14:44.970 --> 00:14:47.440
Whereas, when you have the
Allee effect, what that's saying

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:50.560
is that over some range of
population size or densities,

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:52.785
there is a positive effect
of other individuals

00:14:52.785 --> 00:14:53.580
in the population.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:07.740
This is saying that if we
plot gamma, in particular,

00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:14.670
the derivative of gamma with
respect to n is greater than 0

00:15:14.670 --> 00:15:19.220
for some n.

00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:24.010
This is just saying that if we
plot this per capita division

00:15:24.010 --> 00:15:26.750
rate as a function of the
size of the population,

00:15:26.750 --> 00:15:30.710
there's some region in which
this thing has positive slope.

00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:32.870
And often, people
distinguish between

00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:35.280
the so-called strong Allee
effect and the weak Allee

00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:36.500
effect.

00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:38.700
The strong Allee effect
corresponds to the situation

00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:43.740
where at n equal to zero,
you start out with negative

00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:44.810
per capita growth rates.

00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:50.140
So this is just some
generic curve here,

00:15:50.140 --> 00:15:51.530
that describes the Allee effect.

00:15:51.530 --> 00:15:56.230
The important thing is that
it's coming up here at low n.

00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:59.710
And what this
tells us is that we

00:15:59.710 --> 00:16:01.860
will have some sort
of different dynamics

00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:05.780
where this is going to be the
stable size of the population

00:16:05.780 --> 00:16:07.380
here.

00:16:07.380 --> 00:16:10.140
But there's also a minimal
size required for survival.

00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:13.310
So if you start out below
this n, then you come down.

00:16:17.695 --> 00:16:19.320
If you want you want,
you could call it

00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:27.960
some-- This could be some
k, and this could be n-min.

00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:32.450
This is saying if we plot
n as a function of time

00:16:32.450 --> 00:16:36.980
starting with different
sizes of the population,

00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:40.960
then indeed, this thing
is a stable state.

00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:44.904
But the key thing is that
there's this other minimal size

00:16:44.904 --> 00:16:45.820
required for survival.

00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:49.360
So if you start out around here,
then just above it you come up,

00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:51.382
but just below
it, you come down.

00:16:57.154 --> 00:16:57.820
What do you say?

00:16:57.820 --> 00:16:59.760
What you see is
that this population

00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:02.130
that experiences the
strong Allee effect

00:17:02.130 --> 00:17:03.670
has bistable fates.

00:17:06.290 --> 00:17:07.190
So it's bistable.

00:17:07.190 --> 00:17:09.730
This is bistable depending
on the starting size

00:17:09.730 --> 00:17:10.564
n of the population.

00:17:14.359 --> 00:17:20.310
Now, can somebody suggest
possible explanations

00:17:20.310 --> 00:17:22.240
for why there might
an Allee effect?

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:43.789
AUDIENCE: Sexual reproduction?

00:17:43.789 --> 00:17:45.080
PROFESSOR: Sexual reproduction.

00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:47.583
And can you explain
that a little bit more?

00:17:47.583 --> 00:17:48.458
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:56.920
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:17:56.920 --> 00:17:59.360
And basically, just
the need to find mates.

00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:15.600
So this implies that
at some density,

00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:17.287
sexual reproducing
species are expected

00:18:17.287 --> 00:18:18.370
to have this Allee effect.

00:18:18.370 --> 00:18:20.510
It doesn't mean
that the Allee fact

00:18:20.510 --> 00:18:23.980
is super strong at
moderate sizes, right?

00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:25.940
I think that this
statement is true,

00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:29.679
but it might lead us to conclude
that these extreme dynamics

00:18:29.679 --> 00:18:32.220
that we're talking about here
are relevant for every sexually

00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:33.053
reproducing species.

00:18:33.053 --> 00:18:38.670
But ultimately, the question
is maybe how big is this n-min?

00:18:38.670 --> 00:18:43.850
If n-min is two, then it's
not a severe constraint

00:18:43.850 --> 00:18:45.700
on the population.

00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:50.850
Whereas if n-min is-- if you
need to have 100 California

00:18:50.850 --> 00:18:53.110
condors in order to have
a viable population,

00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:54.580
then that's a problem.

00:18:54.580 --> 00:18:56.990
So there really is a
quantitative question

00:18:56.990 --> 00:19:01.790
of how big is this minimal size.

00:19:01.790 --> 00:19:05.474
Other suggestions of why it is
you might have an Allee effect?

00:19:05.474 --> 00:19:08.210
AUDIENCE: The animal
species in groups?

00:19:08.210 --> 00:19:09.210
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:19:09.210 --> 00:19:10.350
Group hunting.

00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:15.106
And are you aware of any cases
that have group hunting ?

00:19:15.106 --> 00:19:17.299
AUDIENCE: Wolves?

00:19:17.299 --> 00:19:18.840
PROFESSOR: That's
right, so, exactly.

00:19:21.670 --> 00:19:24.751
Right, so wolves for
example, can take down

00:19:24.751 --> 00:19:26.750
like bison, of large
animals they would never be

00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:28.980
able to take down on their own.

00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:33.920
So this could be this could be
wolves, it could be primates.

00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:37.350
We historically did-- I guess
we still have some groups.

00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:41.970
Societies will have
things like this.

00:19:41.970 --> 00:19:44.240
But even at the
microscopic realm,

00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:47.500
if you look at just bacteria
or yeast and so forth,

00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:51.480
there are often cases where
food is generated or broken

00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:53.230
down outside of the cell.

00:19:53.230 --> 00:19:54.810
So any of these
cases where you have

00:19:54.810 --> 00:19:57.000
secreted enzymatic breakdown.

00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:07.840
That was an i.

00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:13.100
Other thoughts?

00:20:20.777 --> 00:20:21.277
Yes?

00:20:21.277 --> 00:20:22.777
AUDIENCE: Protection
from predators?

00:20:22.777 --> 00:20:24.000
PROFESSOR: Right, protection.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.050
And so this is the
flip side of this,

00:20:26.050 --> 00:20:28.300
so this would be
predator avoidance.

00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:32.490
Or an example of
that would be what?

00:20:32.490 --> 00:20:34.430
AUDIENCE: Antelopes.

00:20:34.430 --> 00:20:37.093
PROFESSOR: What do antelopes do?

00:20:37.093 --> 00:20:38.980
AUDIENCE: They run in groups.

00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:39.980
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:41.880
So the standard
example here is kind

00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:45.130
of what herding behavior
of land animals, schooling

00:20:45.130 --> 00:20:47.450
behavior of fish.

00:20:47.450 --> 00:20:51.370
Of course, researchers
argue about to what degree

00:20:51.370 --> 00:20:54.750
the benefits are primarily
this, versus something else.

00:20:54.750 --> 00:20:56.940
I am not going to weigh
in on that debate.

00:20:56.940 --> 00:21:04.680
But, I'd be surprised
if this were never true.

00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:09.560
In all these examples, there's
clearly something cooperative

00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:10.779
about the dynamics.

00:21:10.779 --> 00:21:12.320
In that sense, it
kind of makes sense

00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:14.920
to think there's some element
of cooperative growth,

00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:17.750
whether it's on the hunting
side, or the protection side.

00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:24.440
So if you look at
all these cases

00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:26.424
these would all be very
naturally described

00:21:26.424 --> 00:21:27.590
as some sort of cooperation.

00:21:30.057 --> 00:21:32.390
I do want to highlight though,
that the Allee effect can

00:21:32.390 --> 00:21:34.640
be caused by things that
lead to what you might

00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:36.100
call effective cooperation.

00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:38.145
So it's not like
obviously cooperative,

00:21:38.145 --> 00:21:39.520
or not intentionally
cooperative,

00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:42.220
but still has the same effect.

00:21:42.220 --> 00:21:45.075
A nice example of this is what
we call predator satiation.

00:21:51.130 --> 00:21:53.692
Can somebody guess
what this might mean?

00:21:53.692 --> 00:21:54.900
Somebody's laughing so it's--

00:21:57.265 --> 00:21:59.139
AUDIENCE: If there are
enough animals around,

00:21:59.139 --> 00:22:00.361
the predator will be fed.

00:22:00.361 --> 00:22:01.360
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:03.630
If the predators
gets full, then you

00:22:03.630 --> 00:22:05.660
can end up with something
that's like this.

00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:09.620
And the way I think about this
is just in a group like this,

00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:15.180
if 20 bears come in
and eat 20 of us,

00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:18.350
then we hope that there
are 20 other people that

00:22:18.350 --> 00:22:21.070
will get eaten first, so that
you know that the leftovers can

00:22:21.070 --> 00:22:21.570
run off.

00:22:21.570 --> 00:22:22.070
Right?

00:22:25.180 --> 00:22:28.170
This is embodied in that joke
that people tell when they're

00:22:28.170 --> 00:22:32.004
the two hikers in the woods, and
they see the mother bear that's

00:22:32.004 --> 00:22:33.670
angry and one of the
hikers reaches down

00:22:33.670 --> 00:22:36.350
and starts tying his shoelaces.

00:22:36.350 --> 00:22:38.990
And the other thing the hiking
partner says why are you

00:22:38.990 --> 00:22:40.230
tying your shoelaces?

00:22:40.230 --> 00:22:41.632
You can't outrun a bear, right?

00:22:41.632 --> 00:22:43.340
And the guys says,
well yeah I know that,

00:22:43.340 --> 00:22:46.370
but I only have to outrun you.

00:22:46.370 --> 00:22:48.680
That's predator satiation.

00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:52.500
So if the predator
gets full, then you

00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:54.670
can get something
that looks like this.

00:22:54.670 --> 00:22:57.350
It's below some size,
below this n-min size,

00:22:57.350 --> 00:22:59.100
they all get eaten by that bear.

00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:03.960
And above it, the population
may be able to grow.

00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:06.425
So this is a good
example of just

00:23:06.425 --> 00:23:08.240
that it's an effective
form of cooperation.

00:23:14.580 --> 00:23:21.140
Now can somebody explain--
Well, first of all,

00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:23.530
does this lead to
a full bifurcation

00:23:23.530 --> 00:23:24.730
if we add a death rate?

00:23:27.424 --> 00:23:29.590
We're going to think about
this first seven seconds,

00:23:29.590 --> 00:23:30.760
then we'll vote.

00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:34.430
The question: if we add
a death rate to this,

00:23:34.430 --> 00:23:36.645
does that lead to a fold
or saddle-node bifurcation?

00:23:42.497 --> 00:23:44.830
I'm going to give you more
than seven seconds, because I

00:23:44.830 --> 00:23:46.620
see a lot of brain activity.

00:23:53.310 --> 00:23:55.018
Does this one lead to
a full bifurcation?

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:04.690
Ready?

00:24:04.690 --> 00:24:07.040
Three, two, one.

00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:15.420
The answer is, in
this case, yes.

00:24:19.180 --> 00:24:23.384
So we'll say Allee effect is in
general the kind of thing that

00:24:23.384 --> 00:24:24.550
leads to a full bifurcation.

00:24:24.550 --> 00:24:26.010
In this case, it
definitely does.

00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:31.100
So it's really very
important to be

00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:34.040
able to take curves like
this, and figure out

00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:37.750
what the bifurcation
diagram looks like.

00:24:37.750 --> 00:24:41.380
And just remember that the
solid and dashed lines here

00:24:41.380 --> 00:24:43.640
are very useful for
getting intuition

00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:45.950
on what's going on, because
stable is telling us

00:24:45.950 --> 00:24:49.932
that any perturbation away
from this point, it goes away.

00:24:49.932 --> 00:24:51.390
So this is why we
draw arrows here.

00:24:54.590 --> 00:24:57.790
Arrows come here.

00:24:57.790 --> 00:25:04.325
So this is saying that starting
at 0, from a differential

00:25:04.325 --> 00:25:05.700
equation standpoint
at least, you

00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:09.895
can add a single individual
n, and that individual

00:25:09.895 --> 00:25:12.320
will reproduce and gets to
whatever the effective carrying

00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:14.050
capacity is at that delta.

00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:21.370
So what we can do is we can
draw the same bifurcation

00:25:21.370 --> 00:25:23.351
diagram here.

00:25:23.351 --> 00:25:29.440
Where we look at the population
size as a function of delta.

00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:31.810
And now it's actually somewhat
more interesting looking,

00:25:31.810 --> 00:25:35.560
because in the absence
of this death rate,

00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:37.109
we have it start at k.

00:25:37.109 --> 00:25:39.525
So what's going to happen is
it's going to come like this.

00:25:43.897 --> 00:25:45.730
And the reason we call
it a full bifurcation

00:25:45.730 --> 00:25:50.860
is because these fixed points
fold over on themselves.

00:25:50.860 --> 00:25:53.980
Now this is a bifurcation where
as a function is a control

00:25:53.980 --> 00:25:56.650
parameter, it's not that
these fixed points exchange

00:25:56.650 --> 00:25:59.070
stability, but rather that
the fixed points collide

00:25:59.070 --> 00:26:00.820
and annihilate.

00:26:00.820 --> 00:26:03.710
So in general, a bifurcation
is where something qualitative

00:26:03.710 --> 00:26:06.670
happens to the fixed points.

00:26:06.670 --> 00:26:08.550
In this case, the
number of fixed points

00:26:08.550 --> 00:26:11.200
did not change as a function
of the control parameter.

00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:14.400
Whereas in this
case, it does change.

00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:17.600
But there are only certain
characteristic ways

00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:19.610
in which these six points
are allowed to change.

00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:30.670
So from this, we
can draw our arrows.

00:26:34.610 --> 00:26:38.510
n equal to 0 is still a
stable point down here.

00:26:38.510 --> 00:26:41.547
So we can draw.

00:26:41.547 --> 00:26:43.380
This is where colored
chalk would be useful.

00:26:51.602 --> 00:26:52.560
We can draw our arrows.

00:27:01.804 --> 00:27:02.720
What do I do out here?

00:27:07.430 --> 00:27:11.690
Now, the reason that we say
that this population experiences

00:27:11.690 --> 00:27:14.170
a sudden transition,
or a tipping point,

00:27:14.170 --> 00:27:16.920
is because you can imagine
that this death rate being

00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:18.794
a slowly changing parameter.

00:27:18.794 --> 00:27:20.210
So you could imagine
that it could

00:27:20.210 --> 00:27:22.470
be a slow acidification
of the oceans,

00:27:22.470 --> 00:27:25.560
or a slow increase in
the amount of fishing

00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:26.790
that takes place here.

00:27:26.790 --> 00:27:29.730
So then what can happen is that
the size of the population,

00:27:29.730 --> 00:27:31.550
it's very healthy here.

00:27:31.550 --> 00:27:32.940
It's pretty happy, happy.

00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:36.020
Here it's maybe decreasing
some, but you might not

00:27:36.020 --> 00:27:36.810
sound an alarm.

00:27:36.810 --> 00:27:39.950
But what can happen is
that at some critical level

00:27:39.950 --> 00:27:42.540
of environmental conditions,
some critical level of fishing,

00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:45.380
for example, you can get
this catastrophic collapse

00:27:45.380 --> 00:27:46.340
of the population.

00:27:46.340 --> 00:27:50.162
Where over short periods of
time, it can suddenly collapse.

00:27:50.162 --> 00:27:51.620
Indeed, this sort
of thing has been

00:27:51.620 --> 00:27:54.560
observed in a number of
fisheries around the world.

00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:57.480
So if you go to, for example,
the Monterey Bay Aquarium

00:27:57.480 --> 00:28:03.110
in Monterey, California,
they have a very nice display

00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:06.050
explaining how that space
ended up becoming and aquarium.

00:28:06.050 --> 00:28:08.380
Because it used to
be a sardine fishery,

00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:12.230
and was a very productive
fishery in the years leading up

00:28:12.230 --> 00:28:13.590
to World War II.

00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:15.815
But if you look at the
number of fish that

00:28:15.815 --> 00:28:18.010
were caught as a function
of time, it goes up,

00:28:18.010 --> 00:28:19.970
up, because there's
fishing more and more, then

00:28:19.970 --> 00:28:22.200
all of the sudden, they
just presumably fish

00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:25.369
too much and over a time
span of a few years,

00:28:25.369 --> 00:28:26.910
the fishery collapsed,
and there were

00:28:26.910 --> 00:28:30.570
just no more sardines to catch.

00:28:30.570 --> 00:28:33.630
That whole street there
used to be canneries.

00:28:33.630 --> 00:28:35.330
But then it all went
out of business.

00:28:35.330 --> 00:28:38.890
And those buildings were
largely unused for many years.

00:28:38.890 --> 00:28:41.107
But then eventually,
the aquarium

00:28:41.107 --> 00:28:43.190
went and bought some of
them and refurbished them,

00:28:43.190 --> 00:28:44.606
and now it's a
beautiful aquarium.

00:28:44.606 --> 00:28:48.250
So I encourage you
to check it out.

00:28:48.250 --> 00:28:50.370
But that being
said, the collapse

00:28:50.370 --> 00:28:52.740
is probably still
bad, even though it

00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:54.750
led to this nice
outcome eventually.

00:28:54.750 --> 00:28:59.100
And what you can see is that not
only are these tipping points

00:28:59.100 --> 00:29:03.020
or the sudden transitions
maybe undesirable in the case

00:29:03.020 --> 00:29:06.380
of fishery, but it also would
be very difficult to reverse.

00:29:06.380 --> 00:29:08.590
Because it's not that--
You couldn't imagined

00:29:08.590 --> 00:29:10.750
that the bifurcation diagram
look rather different.

00:29:10.750 --> 00:29:12.041
It could have looked like this.

00:29:16.605 --> 00:29:17.980
What kind of
bifurcation is this?

00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:23.290
So this is still
a transcritical.

00:29:23.290 --> 00:29:25.475
It doesn't have to
be a line throughout,

00:29:25.475 --> 00:29:29.390
because in principle there was
this unstable thing down here.

00:29:29.390 --> 00:29:31.960
This is again, and, as a
function of some parameter,

00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:33.610
we'll say delta.

00:29:33.610 --> 00:29:37.400
And so you'd say, oh this is
a rather sudden transition.

00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:39.590
In the sense that a
modest change in delta

00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:43.170
will lead to a dramatic change
in the size of the population.

00:29:43.170 --> 00:29:45.622
But there's something that's
very qualitatively different

00:29:45.622 --> 00:29:46.580
about these situations.

00:29:46.580 --> 00:29:49.430
Which is that, here you can
imagine that if you improve

00:29:49.430 --> 00:29:52.130
the quality of the environment,
and then you reintroduce fish,

00:29:52.130 --> 00:29:54.730
or maybe you don't even
have to introduce fish,

00:29:54.730 --> 00:29:56.719
they can come from
a different area.

00:29:56.719 --> 00:29:59.010
Then, just by improving the
quality of the environment,

00:29:59.010 --> 00:30:01.180
you get recovery.

00:30:01.180 --> 00:30:03.720
Whereas here, that's
very difficult to do,

00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:06.135
because the system is
hysteretic, or has memory.

00:30:09.012 --> 00:30:10.470
That means that
even if you improve

00:30:10.470 --> 00:30:11.969
the quality of the
environment here,

00:30:11.969 --> 00:30:15.302
it may be very difficult to get
back to your previous state.

00:30:15.302 --> 00:30:16.760
People think that
they've seen this

00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:20.040
in the context of
these transitions

00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:23.520
in lake ecosystems, so-called
eutrophication transition,

00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:26.570
where you get as
a result of maybe

00:30:26.570 --> 00:30:29.880
runoff from agricultural uses.

00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:32.370
You can get the sun
transitions of not

00:30:32.370 --> 00:30:34.990
just a single population,
but of an entire ecosystem.

00:30:34.990 --> 00:30:36.700
So the lake can
go from this thing

00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:40.330
where it's nice and clear and
beautiful summer vacations

00:30:40.330 --> 00:30:45.580
spot, to this really green
kind of algal take over.

00:30:45.580 --> 00:30:49.060
And it can be very
difficult to get recovery.

00:30:49.060 --> 00:30:50.716
There's was a question?

00:30:50.716 --> 00:30:51.216
No?

00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:02.430
And so the basic--
We'll say something

00:31:02.430 --> 00:31:04.450
about the early
warning indicators.

00:31:04.450 --> 00:31:06.620
Well maybe I'll say it now.

00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:08.660
So based on the
review that you read,

00:31:08.660 --> 00:31:11.270
there's this phenomenon
of critical slowing down

00:31:11.270 --> 00:31:16.220
that tells us that
in principle, you

00:31:16.220 --> 00:31:19.050
can anticipate the transitions
about to take place.

00:31:22.350 --> 00:31:25.590
And the statement was that
the dominant eigenvalue

00:31:25.590 --> 00:31:27.120
described in dynamics,
a system went

00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:29.150
to 0 at one of these points.

00:31:35.690 --> 00:31:37.450
Now, the systems they
were talking about

00:31:37.450 --> 00:31:40.690
were presumably
systems like this.

00:31:40.690 --> 00:31:44.000
This is a so-called zero
eigenvalue bifurcation,

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:49.300
were the eigenvalue goes to
0 at this point right here.

00:31:54.110 --> 00:31:55.420
So here's a question for you.

00:31:57.950 --> 00:32:00.630
Does the eigenvalue describe
the dynamics of a system

00:32:00.630 --> 00:32:02.470
go to 0 at this point?

00:32:12.030 --> 00:32:13.090
At transcritical.

00:32:15.675 --> 00:32:17.130
In a transcritical bifurcation.

00:32:22.449 --> 00:32:23.740
Do you understand the question?

00:32:30.709 --> 00:32:32.500
I'll let you think
about it for 20 seconds,

00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:35.180
because this is maybe
not totally obvious.

00:32:55.580 --> 00:32:57.350
Do you need more time?

00:32:57.350 --> 00:32:59.080
I'm wondering.

00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:02.500
Maybe people are sufficiently
lost or confused.

00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:10.580
They're not sure what--
Nod if you want more time.

00:33:10.580 --> 00:33:11.170
OK.

00:33:11.170 --> 00:33:11.670
Ready?

00:33:14.410 --> 00:33:16.305
Three, two, one.

00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:22.590
I'd say it's a kind
of a 50-50 thing.

00:33:22.590 --> 00:33:24.120
So go ahead and
turn to you neighbor

00:33:24.120 --> 00:33:27.460
and try to figure out, using
some combination of math

00:33:27.460 --> 00:33:30.300
and graphical analysis,
whether the bifurcate--

00:33:30.300 --> 00:33:32.870
Whether at this
transcritical bifurcation

00:33:32.870 --> 00:33:34.357
the eigenvalue goes to 0.

00:33:37.339 --> 00:34:50.830
[SIDE CONVERSATIONS]

00:34:50.830 --> 00:34:53.730
PROFESSOR: It sounds like
the discussion is maybe

00:34:53.730 --> 00:34:56.830
gone to completion.

00:34:56.830 --> 00:34:58.220
Let's go ahead and vote again.

00:34:58.220 --> 00:35:00.930
The question is, does
the dominant eigenvalue

00:35:00.930 --> 00:35:03.140
of this system go to
0 at this point here?

00:35:03.140 --> 00:35:04.940
The trans critical bifurcation.

00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:05.700
Ready?

00:35:05.700 --> 00:35:07.885
Three, two, one.

00:35:10.450 --> 00:35:10.950
Alright.

00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:15.440
It doesn't seem like it's
had much of an effect.

00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:18.194
I see that one person has
been convinced of something.

00:35:18.194 --> 00:35:19.860
I don't know if he's
actually convinced,

00:35:19.860 --> 00:35:21.805
of if he was just
surrounded and bullied.

00:35:25.500 --> 00:35:27.530
All right, so what are
some different ways

00:35:27.530 --> 00:35:28.780
of thinking about this?

00:35:32.410 --> 00:35:33.210
Yes?

00:35:33.210 --> 00:35:37.674
AUDIENCE: Well,
one of my neighbors

00:35:37.674 --> 00:35:40.154
decided to actually
just lineralize

00:35:40.154 --> 00:35:41.445
that equation at that point.

00:35:41.445 --> 00:35:42.320
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:48.920
AUDIENCE: If you were
completely into you intuition,

00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:50.357
this would be a way to check.

00:35:50.357 --> 00:35:51.190
PROFESSOR: Right OK.

00:35:51.190 --> 00:35:54.240
And now in general, in
life, I'm a big believer

00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:55.990
when you're confronted
with some question,

00:35:55.990 --> 00:35:59.930
you should first
think about it, what

00:35:59.930 --> 00:36:02.390
you should guess based
on whatever intuition

00:36:02.390 --> 00:36:04.280
might be available to you.

00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:07.080
And then after you have made
a guess based on intuition,

00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:09.110
then you go and you
do the calculation.

00:36:09.110 --> 00:36:11.980
Which in this case,
linearizing around.

00:36:11.980 --> 00:36:13.230
And where do linearize around?

00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:17.620
Around the fixed point.

00:36:17.620 --> 00:36:20.380
I would say that you
really want to linearize

00:36:20.380 --> 00:36:24.069
maybe not around-- You get the
same answer if you lineralize

00:36:24.069 --> 00:36:26.360
around 0, but you really want
to, I think conceptually,

00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:30.611
you want to linearize around
this stable fixed point.

00:36:30.611 --> 00:36:31.110
Right?

00:36:31.110 --> 00:36:33.680
Because, in some ways, it's
the stable fixed point that

00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:36.340
the system is sitting in, and
you want to know how is it that

00:36:36.340 --> 00:36:38.673
you're-- How is it is you're
going to react when you get

00:36:38.673 --> 00:36:40.650
perturbed away from
that fixed point?

00:36:40.650 --> 00:36:44.520
And you do get the same answer.

00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:48.430
The thing is that it's true
that the eigenvalue describing

00:36:48.430 --> 00:36:50.560
the dynamics around this
unstable fixed point

00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:53.030
also goes to zero.

00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:55.660
But that's because, I think
the rules of mathematics

00:36:55.660 --> 00:36:57.785
somehow say that the fixed
points are going to have

00:36:57.785 --> 00:36:59.180
to do something similar.

00:36:59.180 --> 00:37:02.185
So I think you do also
find the eigenvalue here

00:37:02.185 --> 00:37:03.560
as it goes to 0,
but conceptually

00:37:03.560 --> 00:37:05.351
that's not the eigenvalue
that you actually

00:37:05.351 --> 00:37:06.791
want to know about.

00:37:06.791 --> 00:37:08.280
Do you see why I'm saying that?

00:37:11.290 --> 00:37:14.860
Again, the eigenvalue
here is going to 0.

00:37:14.860 --> 00:37:16.660
We can try to explore
this a little bit,

00:37:16.660 --> 00:37:20.950
but I just want to kind of
tie this together and say--

00:37:20.950 --> 00:37:23.980
These local bifurcations
that you have maybe

00:37:23.980 --> 00:37:27.070
heard about, which is that
this fold bifurcation,

00:37:27.070 --> 00:37:31.250
the transcritical bifurcation,
and also the Hopf bifurcation.

00:37:31.250 --> 00:37:34.020
So the Hopf is one
that looks where

00:37:34.020 --> 00:37:35.820
you have a stable
fixed point that goes--

00:37:35.820 --> 00:37:37.910
And in terms of
an unstable line,

00:37:37.910 --> 00:37:39.394
you end up getting oscillations.

00:37:39.394 --> 00:37:40.810
So that's where
you have something

00:37:40.810 --> 00:37:49.340
that that's going to look like--
but now that I'm drawing this,

00:37:49.340 --> 00:37:51.970
I'm a little bit--
Is there a difference

00:37:51.970 --> 00:37:53.809
between a Hopf and a
pitchfork bifurcation?

00:37:53.809 --> 00:37:55.975
AUDIENCE: It's whether you
have oscillations or not.

00:37:55.975 --> 00:37:57.597
You can't really show that.

00:37:57.597 --> 00:37:58.180
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:37:58.180 --> 00:38:02.912
So as drawn, it's
either or both, or?

00:38:02.912 --> 00:38:04.060
AUDIENCE: It's both.

00:38:04.060 --> 00:38:05.870
PROFESSOR: OK well.

00:38:05.870 --> 00:38:10.670
I'll say that this thing also
the eigenvalue goes to 0 here.

00:38:10.670 --> 00:38:13.610
Because I guess,
in this-- You don't

00:38:13.610 --> 00:38:15.690
have to have
oscillations in order--

00:38:15.690 --> 00:38:18.400
And it depends on the
higher dynamic systems.

00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:20.985
But again, this is another
0 eigenvalue bifurcation.

00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:27.740
And so the statement is
that in principle, you

00:38:27.740 --> 00:38:30.500
can use this fact that
the eigenvalue goes to 0,

00:38:30.500 --> 00:38:32.540
this thing called
critical slowing down,

00:38:32.540 --> 00:38:36.840
to measure some changes in
the dynamics of the system

00:38:36.840 --> 00:38:39.230
before, in this case,
you get collapse,

00:38:39.230 --> 00:38:43.120
or before, in this case,
you get extinction.

00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:47.344
The issue maybe is that
in this transition,

00:38:47.344 --> 00:38:48.760
there really is
something big that

00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:50.359
happened at the bifurcation.

00:38:50.359 --> 00:38:52.150
So you really want to
have an early warning

00:38:52.150 --> 00:38:55.450
signal because there's
a dramatic change,

00:38:55.450 --> 00:38:56.920
and it may be
difficult to reverse.

00:38:56.920 --> 00:39:00.830
Whereas here, the population
size is smoothly going to 0.

00:39:00.830 --> 00:39:04.347
And once you get down to your
last two California condors,

00:39:04.347 --> 00:39:05.680
you know that you're in trouble.

00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:08.510
You don't need any sort
of fancy early warning

00:39:08.510 --> 00:39:11.420
indicator based on fluctuations
or return time, and so forth.

00:39:11.420 --> 00:39:15.400
Instead, just the
number is maybe

00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:20.640
your best measure for the
health of the population.

00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:24.140
So I think that yeah, maybe
I won't do the linearization,

00:39:24.140 --> 00:39:26.410
but I encourage you to do it.

00:39:26.410 --> 00:39:30.270
Because, that's what's
going to be relevant.

00:39:30.270 --> 00:39:31.810
In particular, what
you want to know

00:39:31.810 --> 00:39:36.280
is if there's some-- If you
linearize around there some,

00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:41.330
just be clear, there's
some n equilibrium.

00:39:41.330 --> 00:39:44.250
OK there's some equilibrium,
and then you want to ask,

00:39:44.250 --> 00:39:49.240
well OK now you want to say
if your n is equal to some n

00:39:49.240 --> 00:39:52.330
equilibrium, plus some epsilon.

00:39:52.330 --> 00:39:56.910
Then, if you plug it
into the N dot function,

00:39:56.910 --> 00:39:58.730
you should get an
equation that is

00:39:58.730 --> 00:40:01.319
something where
this epsilon dot is

00:40:01.319 --> 00:40:02.610
going to be equal to something.

00:40:02.610 --> 00:40:03.735
What should it be equal to?

00:40:07.580 --> 00:40:10.240
Something times epsilon.

00:40:10.240 --> 00:40:11.270
And what something?

00:40:14.002 --> 00:40:15.710
AUDIENCE: What we've
been calling lambda?

00:40:15.710 --> 00:40:18.400
PROFESSOR: What we've
been calling labmda.

00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:21.210
So this is saying that if
you go a little bit away

00:40:21.210 --> 00:40:25.351
from the equilibrium,
so small epsilon here,

00:40:25.351 --> 00:40:27.600
that epsilon-- The solution
to this is an exponential,

00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:29.340
it's going to get
exponential decay,

00:40:29.340 --> 00:40:32.120
assuming that lambda is what?

00:40:32.120 --> 00:40:32.750
Negative.

00:40:32.750 --> 00:40:37.512
And that's the
definition of-- is

00:40:37.512 --> 00:40:39.220
When we say this is
a stable fixed point,

00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:40.760
this is unstable, that's
equivalent to saying

00:40:40.760 --> 00:40:42.980
that the lambda here is
negative and the lambda here

00:40:42.980 --> 00:40:43.480
is positive.

00:40:49.020 --> 00:40:52.440
AUDIENCE: That's a
very easy argument.

00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:55.250
They exchange stability.

00:40:55.250 --> 00:40:57.270
So you know that lambda
has to be completely 0.

00:40:57.270 --> 00:40:59.410
PROFESSOR: Yes,
this is the point.

00:40:59.410 --> 00:41:03.679
So we know that lambda here is
positive lambda-- I'm sorry,

00:41:03.679 --> 00:41:05.720
lambda here is negative,
lambda here is positive.

00:41:05.720 --> 00:41:07.099
These fixed points
at this point,

00:41:07.099 --> 00:41:08.890
they're going to exchange
stability so that

00:41:08.890 --> 00:41:10.989
means they had to be equal.

00:41:10.989 --> 00:41:12.780
And where they exchange
is when it crosses.

00:41:12.780 --> 00:41:16.520
So they both-- Well, I
guess independently this

00:41:16.520 --> 00:41:18.790
went-- We should be
able to draw this,

00:41:18.790 --> 00:41:20.600
although I'm a
little bit worried

00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:22.270
that once I try
to draw something

00:41:22.270 --> 00:41:23.353
I'm going to get confused.

00:41:23.353 --> 00:41:25.355
But this is a useful exercise.

00:41:29.240 --> 00:41:34.360
In particular, if we plot
as a function of delta.

00:41:34.360 --> 00:41:38.890
So here, we have the lambdas,
and we have this delta.

00:41:38.890 --> 00:41:42.350
and a delta equal to r
what's going to happen

00:41:42.350 --> 00:41:45.974
is that we're going
to get the one

00:41:45.974 --> 00:41:47.140
guy's going to go like this.

00:41:55.220 --> 00:41:58.080
Something like that.

00:41:58.080 --> 00:42:01.800
Given, that the fixed points
went from stable to unstable,

00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:03.757
unstable to stable, so
they had to cross 0.

00:42:03.757 --> 00:42:05.340
So if they both cross
0 at that point,

00:42:05.340 --> 00:42:09.970
they're going to
be equal n zero.

00:42:09.970 --> 00:42:11.866
You guys agree?

00:42:11.866 --> 00:42:15.642
AUDIENCE: Do we know that the
eigenvalues are going to change

00:42:15.642 --> 00:42:18.207
linearly with the death rate?

00:42:18.207 --> 00:42:18.790
PROFESSOR: No.

00:42:18.790 --> 00:42:20.130
So in general, they don't.

00:42:25.670 --> 00:42:29.970
I'm trying to think if
close to the bifurcation,

00:42:29.970 --> 00:42:33.115
whether I can say.

00:42:33.115 --> 00:42:35.440
The mathematicians I'm
sure can say something.

00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:38.934
I'm not going to.

00:42:38.934 --> 00:42:40.725
AUDIENCE: Does this
also mean that whenever

00:42:40.725 --> 00:42:44.250
we're on a steady state,
approaching bifurcation,

00:42:44.250 --> 00:42:48.800
we'll always see the
critical slowing down?

00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:53.250
If it's a stable fixed
point at a critical value.

00:42:53.250 --> 00:42:58.050
PROFESSOR: I think that the
statement is that in principle,

00:42:58.050 --> 00:42:59.974
critical slowing down occurs.

00:42:59.974 --> 00:43:01.890
But that does not mean
that you'll necessarily

00:43:01.890 --> 00:43:03.000
be able to see it.

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:05.416
Because it could be, there's
just too much noise, or this,

00:43:05.416 --> 00:43:07.620
or that.

00:43:07.620 --> 00:43:11.540
AUDIENCE: So something that
I was thinking about related

00:43:11.540 --> 00:43:15.210
to that is-- So in this case,
it seems like everything

00:43:15.210 --> 00:43:20.970
about the system, the
fluctuations, or anything,

00:43:20.970 --> 00:43:26.282
should be getting very
small, as you approach that.

00:43:26.282 --> 00:43:27.990
PROFESSOR: In principle,
the fluctuations

00:43:27.990 --> 00:43:29.710
are supposed to grow.

00:43:29.710 --> 00:43:32.510
Although this is assuming
that the strength of the noise

00:43:32.510 --> 00:43:33.950
is constant.

00:43:33.950 --> 00:43:36.310
And in this case, the
strength of the noise

00:43:36.310 --> 00:43:39.220
may not be constant, because
if it's demographic noise,

00:43:39.220 --> 00:43:41.620
and the size of your
population is going down.

00:43:41.620 --> 00:43:43.850
This is actually
subtle then, I think.

00:43:47.260 --> 00:43:49.820
And when we typically
talk about these dynamics,

00:43:49.820 --> 00:43:52.480
we're assuming that there's
an added noise source that

00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:56.030
is independent of the variable.

00:43:56.030 --> 00:43:57.790
But if it's demographic
fluctuations

00:43:57.790 --> 00:43:59.706
you're talking about,
that that won't be true.

00:44:01.970 --> 00:44:04.190
I think that it's
also useful to draw,

00:44:04.190 --> 00:44:06.060
to get some intuition
around this,

00:44:06.060 --> 00:44:08.840
based on this idea of
an effective potential.

00:44:08.840 --> 00:44:10.810
So these are
one-dimensional systems,

00:44:10.810 --> 00:44:14.920
which means you can always write
down an effective potential.

00:44:14.920 --> 00:44:21.020
And in this case, what it's
going to look like is--

00:44:21.020 --> 00:44:24.930
This is some u effective as
a function of the population

00:44:24.930 --> 00:44:26.150
size.

00:44:26.150 --> 00:44:32.080
And up here, we have
some stable state here

00:44:32.080 --> 00:44:38.250
that corresponds to something
that looks like this.

00:44:38.250 --> 00:44:40.070
So it starts out maybe at k.

00:44:40.070 --> 00:44:42.720
What happens is, as the
death rate increases,

00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:53.110
this thing kind of turns-- Or,
maybe I didn't quite make it.

00:44:53.110 --> 00:44:57.120
So what you see is
that as the death rate

00:44:57.120 --> 00:45:00.920
here-- So, as we go down
the death rate is going up.

00:45:04.190 --> 00:45:06.670
So that what happens is
the effective potential,

00:45:06.670 --> 00:45:10.110
describing the dynamics of the
population near the equilibrium

00:45:10.110 --> 00:45:12.702
is broadening out.

00:45:12.702 --> 00:45:14.160
So you can think
about the dynamics

00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:17.930
as being equivalent to
an overdamped particle

00:45:17.930 --> 00:45:19.710
in effective potential.

00:45:19.710 --> 00:45:22.700
So for example, for those of
you that have studied single

00:45:22.700 --> 00:45:24.530
molecule biophysics
kinds of things,

00:45:24.530 --> 00:45:28.760
this could be thought of as
a [? poly-centered ?] bead

00:45:28.760 --> 00:45:30.860
that's trapped in
a the laser trap.

00:45:30.860 --> 00:45:33.500
And as you turn down
the power of your laser,

00:45:33.500 --> 00:45:36.660
then the spring constant
describing the dynamics

00:45:36.660 --> 00:45:40.290
of that B in the trap, it
gets weaker and weaker.

00:45:40.290 --> 00:45:42.160
So the potential
broadens, and that

00:45:42.160 --> 00:45:45.680
means that for fixed injection
noise-- fixed temperature-- you

00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:50.000
get these effects, where the
fluctuations will increase

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:52.610
in magnitude, and
you get an increase

00:45:52.610 --> 00:45:54.610
in this autocorrelation time.

00:45:54.610 --> 00:45:56.660
Because for example,
the bead in the trap,

00:45:56.660 --> 00:45:58.180
the autocorrelation
time is indeed

00:45:58.180 --> 00:46:06.360
just equal to the relaxation
time of the bead in the trap.

00:46:06.360 --> 00:46:09.060
And the bifurcation
occurs right at this point

00:46:09.060 --> 00:46:13.230
here, where you see that
this local potential is,

00:46:13.230 --> 00:46:15.580
or the local minimum,
is disappearing.

00:46:15.580 --> 00:46:19.410
That's when this stable
fixed point is gone.

00:46:19.410 --> 00:46:21.440
And then you just
kind of fall off here.

00:46:21.440 --> 00:46:26.970
And that's what leads
to this collapse, which

00:46:26.970 --> 00:46:27.865
I have covered up.

00:46:27.865 --> 00:46:29.115
That leads to the bifurcation.

00:46:35.340 --> 00:46:38.320
And you should, for
example, be able to draw

00:46:38.320 --> 00:46:40.095
an effective potential
here as well.

00:46:42.890 --> 00:46:45.900
But I'll let you play with it.

00:46:49.496 --> 00:46:51.620
But you can see the location
of this unstable fixed

00:46:51.620 --> 00:46:52.700
point shifting as well.

00:46:56.856 --> 00:47:00.780
I'm not sure how
good my drawing is.

00:47:00.780 --> 00:47:03.020
Because in principal,
this unstable fixed point

00:47:03.020 --> 00:47:05.661
should have to come together.

00:47:05.661 --> 00:47:07.660
I'm not sure if that's
very clear in my drawing.

00:47:11.950 --> 00:47:15.900
Just to summarize
this discussion,

00:47:15.900 --> 00:47:18.800
I think there are
a few ways that you

00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:21.480
can think of these early
warning indicators.

00:47:21.480 --> 00:47:24.700
And there's a diagram
that I like to make,

00:47:24.700 --> 00:47:27.640
that I think makes things
more clear, for me, at least.

00:47:27.640 --> 00:47:34.980
Which is that if you
look at this population

00:47:34.980 --> 00:47:39.030
as a function of time, it goes.

00:47:39.030 --> 00:47:44.390
And if there's an environment
quality as a function of time.

00:47:44.390 --> 00:47:47.950
If the environment
has a perturbation,

00:47:47.950 --> 00:47:52.180
then the population will shrink,
and then you'll get recovery.

00:47:52.180 --> 00:47:55.822
And this thing here tells you
about the time for recovery.

00:47:55.822 --> 00:47:57.780
And this basic phenomenon
critical slowing down

00:47:57.780 --> 00:48:00.910
tells you that as the
tipping point approaches,

00:48:00.910 --> 00:48:03.176
as you approach the
bifurcation, that time

00:48:03.176 --> 00:48:05.300
to recover from this
perturbation is going to grow.

00:48:08.660 --> 00:48:10.470
Of course, the other
thing that you can say

00:48:10.470 --> 00:48:14.370
is that even in the absence
of a defied perturbation, even

00:48:14.370 --> 00:48:16.760
if the environment is
constant over time,

00:48:16.760 --> 00:48:20.050
there could just a natural
noise in the system that

00:48:20.050 --> 00:48:21.780
will fluctuate, just
like temperature,

00:48:21.780 --> 00:48:23.100
for the bead in the trap.

00:48:23.100 --> 00:48:25.050
And principle, then
you can measure

00:48:25.050 --> 00:48:27.870
the size of the
fluctuations, the variance,

00:48:27.870 --> 00:48:31.010
as well as the
autocorrelation time

00:48:31.010 --> 00:48:34.540
tau, which is, for civil
systems, equal to t.

00:48:34.540 --> 00:48:39.323
And this also grows as you
approach the bifurcation

00:48:39.323 --> 00:48:42.269
AUDIENCE: Is it [? clear ?]
that-- Because the perturbation

00:48:42.269 --> 00:48:46.540
[INAUDIBLE] that you're talking
about is I think n [INAUDIBLE]

00:48:46.540 --> 00:48:49.160
perturbed n into
epsilon, and then it

00:48:49.160 --> 00:48:50.360
relaxes the steady state.

00:48:50.360 --> 00:48:53.002
Is it [INAUDIBLE] to
perturb the environment?

00:48:53.002 --> 00:48:53.960
PROFESSOR: Yeah, right.

00:48:53.960 --> 00:48:55.540
So that's a good question.

00:48:55.540 --> 00:48:57.680
What I've been talking
about is a situation

00:48:57.680 --> 00:49:00.457
where you really literally pull
it away, and then you let go.

00:49:00.457 --> 00:49:02.540
And that's equivalent for
in the bead in the trap,

00:49:02.540 --> 00:49:04.581
that you pull the bead
away, and then you let go,

00:49:04.581 --> 00:49:05.717
and you watch it come back.

00:49:05.717 --> 00:49:07.550
The situation in the
case of the environment

00:49:07.550 --> 00:49:11.270
is that, if it's a kind of
a sudden shift-- It could

00:49:11.270 --> 00:49:15.890
be anything, it could be a brief
change in-- Well it could just

00:49:15.890 --> 00:49:16.490
be delta.

00:49:16.490 --> 00:49:19.249
So it could be that over
some period of time,

00:49:19.249 --> 00:49:21.290
the death rate increases,
or some period of time,

00:49:21.290 --> 00:49:23.430
the growth rate decreases.

00:49:23.430 --> 00:49:26.105
Or it could be that for--
The perturbations don't

00:49:26.105 --> 00:49:27.860
have to be bad, they
can also be good,

00:49:27.860 --> 00:49:29.450
and you actually get the same.

00:49:29.450 --> 00:49:31.420
The principal for small
perturbations to go,

00:49:31.420 --> 00:49:32.545
it's the same thing anyway.

00:49:37.680 --> 00:49:39.790
So these are early
warning indicators

00:49:39.790 --> 00:49:41.990
of an impending
transition that are

00:49:41.990 --> 00:49:43.205
based on temporal indicators.

00:49:45.950 --> 00:49:48.990
And one of the things that we've
been excited about in my group

00:49:48.990 --> 00:49:51.080
is actually just trying
to measure these things

00:49:51.080 --> 00:49:53.300
in a well controlled
laboratory population.

00:49:53.300 --> 00:49:55.097
Since in our case,
we're using yeast

00:49:55.097 --> 00:49:57.430
that are engaging in what you
might call a group hunting

00:49:57.430 --> 00:50:00.060
behavior, where they secrete an
enzyme that breaks down sugar,

00:50:00.060 --> 00:50:02.143
and that kind of leads to
this cooperative growth.

00:50:02.143 --> 00:50:04.270
And at least in that case,
we can experimentally

00:50:04.270 --> 00:50:06.230
measure an increase
in all of these things

00:50:06.230 --> 00:50:07.563
as we approach this bifurcation.

00:50:10.549 --> 00:50:12.090
The other thing you
might think about

00:50:12.090 --> 00:50:14.620
is what happens for spatially
extended populations?

00:50:14.620 --> 00:50:17.640
We'll talk more about spatial
populations on Thursday,

00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:20.180
but just while we're here,
it's useful to think about it.

00:50:20.180 --> 00:50:22.596
So instead of thinking about
just n as a function of time,

00:50:22.596 --> 00:50:24.690
now you want to think about
density of population.

00:50:24.690 --> 00:50:26.240
So one thing that
people talked about

00:50:26.240 --> 00:50:29.300
is that-- Sorry, this is
not a function of time,

00:50:29.300 --> 00:50:31.230
it's now a function
of position x.

00:50:31.230 --> 00:50:33.259
Density is a
function of position.

00:50:33.259 --> 00:50:35.050
Now, environment is a
function of position.

00:50:35.050 --> 00:50:37.980
If you have a uniform
environment over position

00:50:37.980 --> 00:50:39.442
or space, then in
principle you can

00:50:39.442 --> 00:50:40.650
look at density fluctuations.

00:50:40.650 --> 00:50:43.400
And this is something that
people have talked about.

00:50:43.400 --> 00:50:45.850
One of things that
we have argued

00:50:45.850 --> 00:50:49.680
is that there should be a
spatial analog to this recovery

00:50:49.680 --> 00:50:50.614
time.

00:50:50.614 --> 00:50:52.030
So that corresponds
to a situation

00:50:52.030 --> 00:50:54.239
where you have environment
as a function of position.

00:50:54.239 --> 00:50:56.363
Like for example, we have
a sharp boundary, or just

00:50:56.363 --> 00:50:57.460
a region of poor quality.

00:50:57.460 --> 00:51:01.120
And in that case, you
can look at the density

00:51:01.120 --> 00:51:05.240
as a function of position, and
you get some linked scale here.

00:51:05.240 --> 00:51:07.862
So the statement here is
that, just because you're

00:51:07.862 --> 00:51:09.320
in a region of high
quality doesn't

00:51:09.320 --> 00:51:10.990
mean that you're at your
equilibrium density,

00:51:10.990 --> 00:51:12.698
because if you're
close to a poor region,

00:51:12.698 --> 00:51:14.480
so if you're close
to hunting grounds,

00:51:14.480 --> 00:51:17.724
then you'll get local
depletion of the population.

00:51:17.724 --> 00:51:19.890
You have to get some distance
away from a bad region

00:51:19.890 --> 00:51:21.223
before you get your equilibrium.

00:51:21.223 --> 00:51:23.960
That distance or
recovery length tells you

00:51:23.960 --> 00:51:26.500
about the quality
of the environment.

00:51:26.500 --> 00:51:29.120
And it's the quality of the
environment at this region,

00:51:29.120 --> 00:51:30.430
the good region.

00:51:30.430 --> 00:51:31.632
Where you are.

00:51:31.632 --> 00:51:33.090
At least in the
laboratory, this is

00:51:33.090 --> 00:51:34.120
something that's
actually much easier

00:51:34.120 --> 00:51:35.350
to measure than other things.

00:51:35.350 --> 00:51:38.670
Because, this is a
deterministic phenomenon.

00:51:38.670 --> 00:51:41.670
You don't have to measure
fluctuations over time

00:51:41.670 --> 00:51:43.110
with a high quality time series.

00:51:43.110 --> 00:51:45.200
You don't have to wait for
a perturbation in time,

00:51:45.200 --> 00:51:46.870
like a drought, and
look at recovery.

00:51:46.870 --> 00:51:49.870
Instead, you just take
advantage of natural variations

00:51:49.870 --> 00:51:53.240
in quality of the environment
over space, position, and then

00:51:53.240 --> 00:51:54.860
you measure profiles.

00:51:54.860 --> 00:51:58.370
We have a collaboration
with a professor

00:51:58.370 --> 00:52:01.270
at the University of Pisa who
does field ecology experiments

00:52:01.270 --> 00:52:03.830
with these algal mats on
intertidal communities,

00:52:03.830 --> 00:52:05.265
on islands in the Mediterranean.

00:52:08.490 --> 00:52:10.410
And we have a
[? pronates ?] that we

00:52:10.410 --> 00:52:13.540
can measure this in those
island communities as well.

00:52:17.094 --> 00:52:18.760
Are there any questions
about this stuff

00:52:18.760 --> 00:52:20.652
before we switch gears?

00:52:20.652 --> 00:52:21.152
Yes?

00:52:24.068 --> 00:52:27.660
AUDIENCE: In that example, is
it-- How much control can you

00:52:27.660 --> 00:52:31.224
have over actually [? saying ?]
the quality to the environment?

00:52:33.950 --> 00:52:37.190
PROFESSOR: So in that
manipulation, what they did was

00:52:37.190 --> 00:52:41.870
they basically go in and
they-- So there these,

00:52:41.870 --> 00:52:43.820
they're like miniature
forest somehow.

00:52:43.820 --> 00:52:47.460
So they're little-- They have
alternative stable states.

00:52:47.460 --> 00:52:50.300
What they actually do, they
go and they like chip away

00:52:50.300 --> 00:52:52.390
at the rock to
remove the things.

00:52:52.390 --> 00:52:54.950
And they do it over some range.

00:52:54.950 --> 00:52:57.670
So they experimentally
basically make it a

00:52:57.670 --> 00:53:00.360
challenging environment.

00:53:00.360 --> 00:53:03.380
And apparently, they have
permission to do this.

00:53:03.380 --> 00:53:06.690
So don't try that at
home without asking

00:53:06.690 --> 00:53:08.940
the proper authorities.

00:53:08.940 --> 00:53:11.850
Any other questions about this?

00:53:16.350 --> 00:53:19.030
So I think that the nice
thing about studying

00:53:19.030 --> 00:53:21.350
all these dynamics just
for a single population,

00:53:21.350 --> 00:53:25.350
is that it really clarifies the
essential ingredients, in order

00:53:25.350 --> 00:53:27.280
to get things like
sudden transitions.

00:53:27.280 --> 00:53:29.950
Of course, in
natural populations,

00:53:29.950 --> 00:53:31.660
we have many, many
species and tracking

00:53:31.660 --> 00:53:32.826
in lots of complicated ways.

00:53:32.826 --> 00:53:35.030
But we would like to
understand those things,

00:53:35.030 --> 00:53:36.710
but I think since
it's so complicated,

00:53:36.710 --> 00:53:38.830
you kind of like, oh
anything can happen,

00:53:38.830 --> 00:53:40.790
and you get a little
bit discouraged

00:53:40.790 --> 00:53:42.337
from thinking deeply about it.

00:53:42.337 --> 00:53:44.670
Because, you just think it's
going to be too complicated

00:53:44.670 --> 00:53:45.760
to try to understand.

00:53:45.760 --> 00:53:48.920
I very much like the idea
of trying to really hone

00:53:48.920 --> 00:53:51.480
your intuition on the simplest
possible situation like this,

00:53:51.480 --> 00:53:56.510
and then bringing that intuition
to more complicated or complex

00:53:56.510 --> 00:53:57.460
situations.

00:53:57.460 --> 00:53:58.140
Yeah?

00:53:58.140 --> 00:53:59.806
AUDIENCE: Can you
partially [? adjust ?]

00:53:59.806 --> 00:54:01.900
But what I want to ask
you is whether any of this

00:54:01.900 --> 00:54:04.250
can be applied to human society?

00:54:04.250 --> 00:54:05.620
PROFESSOR: Oh, yeah.

00:54:05.620 --> 00:54:08.270
So whether this could be
applied to human society.

00:54:08.270 --> 00:54:09.660
It's a good question.

00:54:09.660 --> 00:54:11.360
People certainly try to.

00:54:11.360 --> 00:54:16.330
I think you'll always have to
decide what we mean by apply.

00:54:16.330 --> 00:54:18.570
I would say that this
basic idea that there

00:54:18.570 --> 00:54:20.280
could be these
feedback loops that

00:54:20.280 --> 00:54:22.630
can lead to sudden transitions
in complex systems.

00:54:22.630 --> 00:54:26.044
I think this is a very robust
phenomenon, in the sense

00:54:26.044 --> 00:54:28.210
that I think if you have
strong enough interactions,

00:54:28.210 --> 00:54:31.750
then I think you kind
of expect it to be true.

00:54:31.750 --> 00:54:36.780
Another question is whether you
could quantitatively predict

00:54:36.780 --> 00:54:38.960
when that's going to happen.

00:54:38.960 --> 00:54:42.040
There was a recent article
written in science or nature

00:54:42.040 --> 00:54:47.540
about potential tipping
points in human society

00:54:47.540 --> 00:54:49.000
on a global scale.

00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:51.620
Things in terms of
productivity of crops.

00:54:51.620 --> 00:54:54.160
And so they have a
question mark about,

00:54:54.160 --> 00:55:00.150
they say 2050, question
mark, collapse maybe.

00:55:00.150 --> 00:55:03.770
I say it's very important to be
thinking about these things in.

00:55:03.770 --> 00:55:07.710
But the question is what to do,
whether given the uncertainties

00:55:07.710 --> 00:55:10.050
and your knowledge of where
these tipping points might

00:55:10.050 --> 00:55:12.700
occur, it's always hard to
know whether you could make

00:55:12.700 --> 00:55:16.330
a strong argument saying, oh
we have to stop fishing here

00:55:16.330 --> 00:55:17.780
because it's going to collapse.

00:55:20.520 --> 00:55:22.880
There's always uncertainty
in your decision making.

00:55:22.880 --> 00:55:25.130
But certainly in the context
of climate regime shifts,

00:55:25.130 --> 00:55:26.730
people are worried
about these sorts

00:55:26.730 --> 00:55:29.399
of feedback loops and the
North Atlantic Oscillation

00:55:29.399 --> 00:55:29.940
and so forth.

00:55:29.940 --> 00:55:31.523
And I'm not at all
an expert for that,

00:55:31.523 --> 00:55:33.710
so I don't know whether
we should be worried.

00:55:33.710 --> 00:55:38.390
But it's at least
good to remember

00:55:38.390 --> 00:55:44.750
that systems can respond in
dramatic ways to small changes.

00:55:44.750 --> 00:55:47.650
And then, you have to decide
what to do with that knowledge,

00:55:47.650 --> 00:55:50.034
and I think that's more
of a judgement call.

00:55:52.998 --> 00:55:56.950
AUDIENCE: In the time
example, you had death,

00:55:56.950 --> 00:55:59.895
it was a death rate.

00:55:59.895 --> 00:56:02.557
Is that in a [INAUDIBLE] space?

00:56:02.557 --> 00:56:03.140
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:56:03.140 --> 00:56:05.280
So I want to be a little
bit maybe more clear.

00:56:05.280 --> 00:56:09.390
The claim is that-- Like
the death, the delta there

00:56:09.390 --> 00:56:11.380
that we're thinking
about, that didn't

00:56:11.380 --> 00:56:12.870
have to be the perturbation.

00:56:12.870 --> 00:56:15.467
It could be, but it
didn't have to be.

00:56:15.467 --> 00:56:17.300
When we're plotting the
bifurcation diagram,

00:56:17.300 --> 00:56:19.216
we're assuming implicitly
somehow that there's

00:56:19.216 --> 00:56:21.614
a separation of time scales,
such that this delta might

00:56:21.614 --> 00:56:23.530
be changing very slowly,
and then other things

00:56:23.530 --> 00:56:25.480
are changing more rapidly.

00:56:25.480 --> 00:56:27.050
So this bifurcation
diagram, it's

00:56:27.050 --> 00:56:29.630
really that you're tracking it.

00:56:29.630 --> 00:56:33.380
So in the context of this
n as a function of delta,

00:56:33.380 --> 00:56:34.620
this thing goes like this.

00:56:34.620 --> 00:56:37.290
And the idea is that
oh, slowly you're

00:56:37.290 --> 00:56:39.200
getting more and more
agricultural runoff,

00:56:39.200 --> 00:56:40.920
or the temperature
is increasing.

00:56:40.920 --> 00:56:42.794
Doesn't have to be human
induced, by the way,

00:56:42.794 --> 00:56:45.070
it could be something else.

00:56:45.070 --> 00:56:47.810
So the idea is that the
population is slowly

00:56:47.810 --> 00:56:49.200
changing like this.

00:56:49.200 --> 00:56:53.480
And then eventually maybe
you get this collapse.

00:56:53.480 --> 00:56:57.100
Now, a perturbation could
be something that could just

00:56:57.100 --> 00:57:00.290
be a drought, or something that
is independent of this delta.

00:57:00.290 --> 00:57:05.367
But the statement is
that, over here-- Now I'm

00:57:05.367 --> 00:57:06.450
going to be mixing things.

00:57:09.570 --> 00:57:13.170
At low delta, the claim is that
you should get a dip and then

00:57:13.170 --> 00:57:14.910
rapid recovery.

00:57:14.910 --> 00:57:17.252
As the delta gets bigger,
you get maybe even

00:57:17.252 --> 00:57:19.710
a larger-- The same perturbation
could [? principally ?] do

00:57:19.710 --> 00:57:22.650
a larger dip, and it takes
longer to get recovery.

00:57:32.357 --> 00:57:33.940
This actually brings
up another point,

00:57:33.940 --> 00:57:39.030
which is that these could all
be the same perturbations.

00:57:39.030 --> 00:57:45.810
So this is a case where delta
is increasing as we go down.

00:57:45.810 --> 00:57:48.420
So they could be the
same perturbation here.

00:57:48.420 --> 00:57:50.830
Here you survive,
here you survive.

00:57:50.830 --> 00:57:53.130
But then that same perturbation
that was survived here

00:57:53.130 --> 00:57:56.290
could be the same
magnitude drought, just as

00:57:56.290 --> 00:57:59.351
delta increases
you expect this--

00:57:59.351 --> 00:58:01.720
This may be able
to push the system

00:58:01.720 --> 00:58:03.530
past the unstable
fixed point, because

00:58:03.530 --> 00:58:04.956
of a loss of resilience.

00:58:04.956 --> 00:58:06.330
This is something
that we've seen

00:58:06.330 --> 00:58:07.788
in a variety of
different contexts.

00:58:07.788 --> 00:58:10.280
I think it's a very
general phenomenon.

00:58:10.280 --> 00:58:11.759
Just because the
separation here is

00:58:11.759 --> 00:58:13.800
some measure of the
resilience of the population,

00:58:13.800 --> 00:58:16.670
or the ability of the population
to withstand perturbations.

00:58:16.670 --> 00:58:19.980
We can see that the
resilience shrinks as we

00:58:19.980 --> 00:58:21.230
get close to this bifurcation.

00:58:30.380 --> 00:58:32.090
Did that answer your question?

00:58:32.090 --> 00:58:32.820
Sort of?

00:58:32.820 --> 00:58:33.640
Not really.

00:58:33.640 --> 00:58:35.000
AUDIENCE: No, but it
answered another question.

00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:35.550
PROFESSOR: It answered
another question?

00:58:35.550 --> 00:58:36.442
Oh good.

00:58:36.442 --> 00:58:37.900
I'm glad that I
answered something.

00:58:37.900 --> 00:58:40.460
But what was your--
Because you were saying

00:58:40.460 --> 00:58:43.955
is it the death rate that is
causing this perturbation?

00:58:43.955 --> 00:58:44.945
AUDIENCE: Well, no.

00:58:44.945 --> 00:58:47.327
I was wondering for
[? per ?] space.

00:58:47.327 --> 00:58:47.910
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:58:47.910 --> 00:58:49.180
Oh yes, I forgot.

00:58:49.180 --> 00:58:53.100
Yes, I do remember
that you did ask that.

00:58:53.100 --> 00:58:58.570
So the idea here is that this
could be a region that we fish,

00:58:58.570 --> 00:59:01.680
and this could be region that
we don't fish, for example.

00:59:01.680 --> 00:59:04.980
Or it could be
that, here there's

00:59:04.980 --> 00:59:07.860
just not as much food for the
organism as there are here.

00:59:07.860 --> 00:59:09.730
So just the idea
is that you would

00:59:09.730 --> 00:59:12.870
need kind of a sudden sharp
boundary between regions

00:59:12.870 --> 00:59:13.760
of different quality.

00:59:13.760 --> 00:59:15.343
And that's kind of
the situation where

00:59:15.343 --> 00:59:18.315
you would be able to measure
this recovery length.

00:59:18.315 --> 00:59:19.690
And the basic
reason for that, is

00:59:19.690 --> 00:59:22.510
that if the environmental
quality is something

00:59:22.510 --> 00:59:26.370
that changes very slowly,
then the population density

00:59:26.370 --> 00:59:29.060
will just track that.

00:59:29.060 --> 00:59:33.680
So then you can't use that to
measure this recovery length.

00:59:33.680 --> 00:59:36.390
Of course, the same
statement is true here.

00:59:36.390 --> 00:59:39.120
That if you have environmental
perturbations that

00:59:39.120 --> 00:59:40.870
are changing slowly
over time, then

00:59:40.870 --> 00:59:42.681
that also can
complicate this picture.

00:59:48.940 --> 00:59:51.630
Any other questions
about that before we

00:59:51.630 --> 00:59:53.890
move towards
multispecies ecosystems?

00:59:53.890 --> 00:59:55.970
We're going to start
with two species.

01:00:07.265 --> 01:00:08.640
So what I'm going
to do is I want

01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:10.850
to spend the rest
of the class talking

01:00:10.850 --> 01:00:12.910
about Lotka-Volterra
populations.

01:00:12.910 --> 01:00:15.400
And we're going to
move the rock, paper,

01:00:15.400 --> 01:00:18.120
scissors discussion to
Thursday, because it's

01:00:18.120 --> 01:00:20.570
a nice spatial example anyways.

01:00:20.570 --> 01:00:23.810
So let's think about
Lotka-Volterra.

01:00:23.810 --> 01:00:27.380
Now, there's a lot.

01:00:27.380 --> 01:00:28.980
Lotka-Volterra
competition model.

01:00:33.329 --> 01:00:34.870
So the assumption
is that we're going

01:00:34.870 --> 01:00:38.880
to make here is that we
have these two species that

01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:40.950
going to be
interacting, but they're

01:00:40.950 --> 01:00:44.722
going to interact in
kind of the simplest way

01:00:44.722 --> 01:00:45.680
that you might imagine.

01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:50.614
Which is that, if we plot the
derivative of population size

01:00:50.614 --> 01:00:53.280
n1 as a function of time, we get
something that looks like this.

01:01:12.846 --> 01:01:14.220
Now the first
thing that you want

01:01:14.220 --> 01:01:16.470
to do when you see something
like this is just to make

01:01:16.470 --> 01:01:17.970
sense the basic equation.

01:01:26.170 --> 01:01:33.780
In particular, in the
absence of the other species,

01:01:33.780 --> 01:01:36.235
what happens to
these populations?

01:01:38.810 --> 01:01:45.670
We're going to assume here maybe
first is that r1 and r2 are

01:01:45.670 --> 01:01:46.670
both greater than 0.

01:01:49.752 --> 01:01:51.460
It's in the absence
of the other species.

01:01:56.100 --> 01:02:00.260
Do these populations
survive or not?

01:02:00.260 --> 01:02:00.990
Ready?

01:02:00.990 --> 01:02:06.210
Three, we're going do it
A, yes, B, no, our typical.

01:02:06.210 --> 01:02:07.710
All right, absence of a species.

01:02:11.570 --> 01:02:12.070
ready?

01:02:12.070 --> 01:02:14.580
Three, two, one, survival?

01:02:14.580 --> 01:02:15.550
Yeah, they survive.

01:02:15.550 --> 01:02:18.490
For sure, because I told
you that these guys are

01:02:18.490 --> 01:02:21.360
greater than 0, that means--
We can think about n1.

01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:27.100
In the absence n2,
what is this equation?

01:02:27.100 --> 01:02:28.920
Logistic.

01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:33.210
Now, if we wanted to think
about these as describing

01:02:33.210 --> 01:02:36.720
competitive interactions,
what does that tell us

01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:40.590
about the sign of the betas?

01:02:40.590 --> 01:02:45.940
Are the betas greater than
0, or are they less than 0?

01:02:48.842 --> 01:02:50.300
I'll think about
it for 10 seconds.

01:03:02.990 --> 01:03:04.998
All right.

01:03:04.998 --> 01:03:07.230
Do you need more time?

01:03:07.230 --> 01:03:07.760
Ready?

01:03:07.760 --> 01:03:12.080
Three, two, one.

01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:16.330
Competitive means that the
betas are greater than 0.

01:03:16.330 --> 01:03:20.420
And what is the assumption
somehow that's going into this?

01:03:23.940 --> 01:03:28.630
And we should remember that this
is a minus everything up here.

01:03:32.039 --> 01:03:34.961
AUDIENCE: I guess that
somehow these two things

01:03:34.961 --> 01:03:39.344
are-- there's a fixed
amount of some resource,

01:03:39.344 --> 01:03:41.497
that both of these things need.

01:03:41.497 --> 01:03:43.705
PROFESSOR: OK, so there
could be some fixed resource.

01:03:50.157 --> 01:03:54.450
AUDIENCE: It's basically like
an effective carrying capacity.

01:03:54.450 --> 01:03:56.769
PROFESSOR: That's
right, so somehow it's

01:03:56.769 --> 01:03:58.560
modulating the effect
of carrying capacity.

01:04:01.210 --> 01:04:05.430
And how is it that you
would describe these betas?

01:04:09.010 --> 01:04:12.970
AUDIENCE: Sort of seems like
you expect that the beta should

01:04:12.970 --> 01:04:16.373
be probably less than one.

01:04:16.373 --> 01:04:21.100
[INAUDIBLE] I guess it doesn't
have to be less than one.

01:04:23.660 --> 01:04:29.350
Compared to how well
n1-- and individual of n1

01:04:29.350 --> 01:04:31.780
takes up some of this.

01:04:31.780 --> 01:04:35.250
This is how much [INAUDIBLE]

01:04:35.250 --> 01:04:38.230
PROFESSOR: That's right.

01:04:38.230 --> 01:04:39.200
I think that's right.

01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:41.950
Now I think we--
There's a question

01:04:41.950 --> 01:04:44.690
about how explicitly to be
thinking about these resources.

01:04:44.690 --> 01:04:47.040
Because it could be, it doesn't
have to be one resource.

01:04:47.040 --> 01:04:50.530
And this is of course, a
very phenomenological model.

01:04:50.530 --> 01:04:52.700
It's lumping all the
interact-- All of the ways

01:04:52.700 --> 01:04:57.340
in which a species interacts in
just a single parameter beta.

01:04:57.340 --> 01:04:59.820
But it's somehow, the betas
are telling us something

01:04:59.820 --> 01:05:04.920
about how much does a
member of the other species

01:05:04.920 --> 01:05:08.820
inhibit my growth, as compared
to a member of my own species?

01:05:08.820 --> 01:05:13.950
Because we have this n1 here,
and just this species one

01:05:13.950 --> 01:05:16.330
will naturally lead to
a carrying capacity k1,

01:05:16.330 --> 01:05:17.910
you only have species one.

01:05:17.910 --> 01:05:21.190
Now, the betas are telling
you something about

01:05:21.190 --> 01:05:23.280
how much overlap they
have in terms of maybe

01:05:23.280 --> 01:05:24.870
[? niche ?] or so.

01:05:24.870 --> 01:05:27.340
Now, if the betas
are small, it means

01:05:27.340 --> 01:05:31.270
that they're not competing
with each other very much.

01:05:31.270 --> 01:05:33.890
The betas could be larger than
one, and what that's saying

01:05:33.890 --> 01:05:36.360
is that a member of
this other species

01:05:36.360 --> 01:05:38.720
is inhibiting my growth
more than a member

01:05:38.720 --> 01:05:39.485
of my own species.

01:05:51.170 --> 01:05:54.640
So the standard way to
analyze these equations

01:05:54.640 --> 01:05:57.630
is to look at these isoclines.

01:05:57.630 --> 01:06:01.960
So basically, if you say, OK
well n1 dot is equal to zero,

01:06:01.960 --> 01:06:03.950
what does that mean?

01:06:03.950 --> 01:06:07.060
Well, we can just see that
that's equivalent to saying

01:06:07.060 --> 01:06:17.500
that it's n1 plus beta1,2
n2 is equal to k1.

01:06:21.850 --> 01:06:27.430
So this is giving us a
relationship between n1 and n2.

01:06:27.430 --> 01:06:33.210
What do these look like on a
plane, n1 versus n2 drawings?

01:06:42.220 --> 01:06:47.220
So the parabola, it's a line.

01:06:47.220 --> 01:06:49.810
And indeed, we can think about
what happens when each of these

01:06:49.810 --> 01:06:52.350
is equal to one
thing or another.

01:06:52.350 --> 01:06:57.010
So if n1-- If n2 is
equal to 0, this thing

01:06:57.010 --> 01:06:58.060
is going across at k1.

01:07:02.820 --> 01:07:05.340
And that makes sense,
because we already

01:07:05.340 --> 01:07:07.730
decided that in
the absence of n2,

01:07:07.730 --> 01:07:09.700
this thing is just
following logistic growth,

01:07:09.700 --> 01:07:13.550
where the species one
will grow and go to k1.

01:07:13.550 --> 01:07:16.800
And that's a stable
fixed point that n1 dot

01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:18.185
has to be equal to zero.

01:07:18.185 --> 01:07:21.019
It's a fixed point, so n1
dot has to be equal to 0.

01:07:21.019 --> 01:07:22.810
And it's going to cross
at this other point

01:07:22.810 --> 01:07:33.479
here where n2 is going to
be some k1 over beta 1, 2.

01:07:33.479 --> 01:07:34.770
And then we end up with a line.

01:07:43.690 --> 01:07:47.540
Now if we go, and we ask
what n2 dot is equal to,

01:07:47.540 --> 01:07:49.820
and this is equal
to 0, we're going

01:07:49.820 --> 01:07:52.390
to end up with something
that looks very similar.

01:07:52.390 --> 01:07:58.767
But now it's going to be n2 plus
beta 2, 1, n1 is equal to k2.

01:07:58.767 --> 01:08:00.100
This is also going to be a line.

01:08:04.620 --> 01:08:10.030
Given what I have said, how many
different qualitative outcomes

01:08:10.030 --> 01:08:12.460
can you get in this model?

01:08:12.460 --> 01:08:15.414
Where we just assume--
Where we have beta-- Overall

01:08:15.414 --> 01:08:17.664
I think we're thinking about
competitive interactions.

01:08:23.420 --> 01:08:27.029
How many cases do
we need to consider?

01:08:33.990 --> 01:08:36.914
Alright, it's going to be a, 0.

01:08:49.385 --> 01:08:52.140
Do you guys understand
what I mean by cases?

01:08:58.720 --> 01:09:00.479
No?

01:09:00.479 --> 01:09:03.069
I mean, how many different
kind of qualitative outcomes

01:09:03.069 --> 01:09:12.660
can there be in terms of species
one or species two winning,

01:09:12.660 --> 01:09:14.420
or can you get coexistence?

01:09:14.420 --> 01:09:17.890
Or how many different kind
of qualitative outcomes

01:09:17.890 --> 01:09:18.834
can there be?

01:09:23.180 --> 01:09:26.890
And if you're confused, you
can not vote, or give me

01:09:26.890 --> 01:09:27.920
an unhappy face.

01:09:27.920 --> 01:09:29.040
OK, ready?

01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:30.940
Three, two, one.

01:09:33.050 --> 01:09:33.550
So

01:09:33.550 --> 01:09:35.454
We have many Es.

01:09:38.060 --> 01:09:40.640
And can somebody
explain why it that this

01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:45.071
is the case, without invoking
that you've already studied

01:09:45.071 --> 01:09:46.279
this and you know the answer?

01:09:51.019 --> 01:09:55.470
AUDIENCE: If you add another
line, completely on top,

01:09:55.470 --> 01:09:57.920
or under, or it can cross too.

01:09:57.920 --> 01:09:59.730
PROFESSOR: That's
right, that's right.

01:09:59.730 --> 01:10:04.320
So the next thing I was about
to do is draw another line.

01:10:04.320 --> 01:10:07.190
And the reason I stopped is
because there are actually

01:10:07.190 --> 01:10:11.720
four different ways in which
this other line can be drawn.

01:10:11.720 --> 01:10:17.560
And basically, you can have
another line that does one.

01:10:17.560 --> 01:10:19.306
You can have two.

01:10:19.306 --> 01:10:21.910
You can have three.

01:10:21.910 --> 01:10:23.470
And you can have four.

01:10:26.630 --> 01:10:27.130
OK?

01:10:30.100 --> 01:10:33.875
These two cases-- So
this is we'll say one.

01:10:33.875 --> 01:10:35.250
I don't know what
order i did it.

01:10:35.250 --> 01:10:39.190
Two, three, and four.

01:10:39.190 --> 01:10:44.280
Two and three, in both cases we
have the crossing of the lines.

01:10:44.280 --> 01:10:48.070
So maybe does that mean
they're the same outcome,

01:10:48.070 --> 01:10:51.640
the same qualitative outcome?

01:10:51.640 --> 01:10:53.860
No.

01:10:53.860 --> 01:10:57.980
And what will end up
happening here is that we're

01:10:57.980 --> 01:11:02.650
going to get cases of--

01:11:08.680 --> 01:11:10.450
So you basically
can get that species

01:11:10.450 --> 01:11:14.310
one dominates independent
of starting condition,

01:11:14.310 --> 01:11:16.920
assuming that both are
present at the beginning.

01:11:16.920 --> 01:11:18.620
Species two could dominate.

01:11:22.420 --> 01:11:29.010
They could coexist, or
you get bistability.

01:11:29.010 --> 01:11:31.945
History dependent,
mutual exclusion.

01:11:38.260 --> 01:11:40.210
I just want to draw.

01:11:40.210 --> 01:11:45.820
So this one here was the-- We
had a dashed line for n1 dot

01:11:45.820 --> 01:11:48.850
and we had the
solid line for this.

01:11:48.850 --> 01:11:49.574
Yes?

01:11:49.574 --> 01:11:51.615
AUDIENCE: Where is
[? the breaking ?] [INAUDIBLE]

01:12:03.780 --> 01:12:08.670
PROFESSOR: So I guess
if you swap the labels,

01:12:08.670 --> 01:12:09.590
or so, you're saying?

01:12:09.590 --> 01:12:12.100
I guess in the case
that if one of them

01:12:12.100 --> 01:12:17.324
is just above the other one,
then you can distinguish them.

01:12:17.324 --> 01:12:18.740
So if you have a
dashed line here,

01:12:18.740 --> 01:12:22.264
you have a solid line here,
that means that they--

01:12:22.264 --> 01:12:24.724
AUDIENCE: How do I
distinguish case 2 and case 3?

01:12:28.190 --> 01:12:28.690
[INAUDIBLE]

01:12:34.290 --> 01:12:38.840
PROFESSOR: Maybe we
should try to figure out

01:12:38.840 --> 01:12:44.740
which one's which, and then we
can figure it out from there.

01:12:44.740 --> 01:12:47.670
Can somebody remind us,
what are these lines again?

01:12:52.070 --> 01:12:53.988
Why are we drawing them,
or what do they mean?

01:12:58.260 --> 01:13:03.400
So they're not actually
quite a fixed point.

01:13:03.400 --> 01:13:04.170
It's a no incline.

01:13:04.170 --> 01:13:05.961
What's the difference
between these things?

01:13:12.260 --> 01:13:14.500
If we have a fixed point
here, what we're saying

01:13:14.500 --> 01:13:18.080
is that both n1 dot and
n2 dot are equal to 0.

01:13:18.080 --> 01:13:20.080
Fixed point means that
if you start right there,

01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:21.080
you'll stay right there.

01:13:21.080 --> 01:13:23.600
We're not yet say
anything about stability.

01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:28.130
And this is going to be very
relevant for Sam's question.

01:13:28.130 --> 01:13:29.005
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:13:35.800 --> 01:13:37.780
PROFESSOR: The axes
are definitely labeled.

01:13:37.780 --> 01:13:45.320
I think I may agree, but I'm
a little worried that I'm-- If

01:13:45.320 --> 01:13:47.130
you're happy I'm happy.

01:13:47.130 --> 01:13:55.530
OK let's-- A fixed point of this
pair of equations will be when

01:13:55.530 --> 01:13:58.420
both of the derivatives
are equal 0.

01:13:58.420 --> 01:14:00.820
And that's not the
line that we've drawn.

01:14:00.820 --> 01:14:03.930
The lines that we've drawn are
just when one or the other one

01:14:03.930 --> 01:14:04.610
is equal to 0.

01:14:08.770 --> 01:14:12.080
So what does that mean
about in case four,

01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:15.940
is it possible well
to have coexistence?

01:14:15.940 --> 01:14:16.440
No.

01:14:16.440 --> 01:14:18.980
Because there's no
fixed one in the middle.

01:14:18.980 --> 01:14:21.140
The only case it's
possible to get coexistence

01:14:21.140 --> 01:14:23.600
is either line
two or line three.

01:14:26.970 --> 01:14:29.520
But that tells us
there's a fixed point,

01:14:29.520 --> 01:14:33.794
it doesn't tell us about the
stability of the fixed point,

01:14:33.794 --> 01:14:35.170
though.

01:14:35.170 --> 01:14:37.752
What we'll find is
that in one case,

01:14:37.752 --> 01:14:39.710
it's a stable fixed point,
you get coexistence.

01:14:39.710 --> 01:14:41.811
In the other case, it's
an unstable fixed point,

01:14:41.811 --> 01:14:42.810
and you get bistability.

01:14:46.972 --> 01:14:48.430
What we're going
to do now is we're

01:14:48.430 --> 01:14:51.180
going to ask and try to
figure out in which case,

01:14:51.180 --> 01:14:54.060
how do we label these things?

01:14:54.060 --> 01:15:04.530
So what we'll do is ask,
first of all in line one,

01:15:04.530 --> 01:15:07.130
we want to figure out,
is that a situation

01:15:07.130 --> 01:15:09.970
where we know it's
not going to be

01:15:09.970 --> 01:15:12.650
coexistence are bistability,
but is it going to a situation

01:15:12.650 --> 01:15:16.530
where a species one wins,
or when species two wins?

01:15:16.530 --> 01:15:18.830
But, if you want, you can
vote for one of the others.

01:15:18.830 --> 01:15:20.750
I don't want to
constrain your choices.

01:15:20.750 --> 01:15:29.730
So it's going to be a is one
wins, B, two wins, not three

01:15:29.730 --> 01:15:30.230
wins.

01:15:42.402 --> 01:15:43.360
This is something else.

01:15:46.060 --> 01:15:50.380
I'm going to give you a
minute to think about what

01:15:50.380 --> 01:15:52.110
might be going on here.

01:15:52.110 --> 01:15:54.480
So the question is
put in situation one.

01:16:26.830 --> 01:16:29.230
Oh no, I did that wrong.

01:16:29.230 --> 01:16:31.280
In this.

01:16:31.280 --> 01:16:34.400
For the solid line,
this is what we're

01:16:34.400 --> 01:16:35.690
asking for n1 is equal to 0.

01:16:35.690 --> 01:16:38.125
This is just equal to k2.

01:16:38.125 --> 01:16:39.462
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:16:39.462 --> 01:16:40.420
PROFESSOR: What's that?

01:16:43.228 --> 01:16:45.980
AUDIENCE: There's
other [? null ?] lines.

01:16:45.980 --> 01:16:47.730
PROFESSOR: You want
more [? null lines? ?]

01:16:47.730 --> 01:16:50.994
I feel like there are lots
of lines up there already.

01:16:50.994 --> 01:16:55.467
AUDIENCE: Where n equals
0 [? null ?] lines.

01:16:55.467 --> 01:16:57.952
The axes are actual
[? null ?] lines.

01:17:02.162 --> 01:17:03.370
PROFESSOR: Yes, that's right.

01:17:03.370 --> 01:17:05.292
Yeah, that's true.

01:17:05.292 --> 01:17:09.450
AUDIENCE: That helps-- I'm
confused between labels.

01:17:09.450 --> 01:17:10.590
PROFESSOR: Oh, I see.

01:17:13.680 --> 01:17:16.370
OK I'm hesitant to draw
anything more up on the board.

01:17:16.370 --> 01:17:20.950
But it is true that the axes
are also [? null ?] lines.

01:17:20.950 --> 01:17:22.540
Because we have n's up there.

01:17:26.736 --> 01:17:28.360
I'll give you another
20 seconds to try

01:17:28.360 --> 01:17:29.526
to figure out this case one.

01:17:34.650 --> 01:17:36.887
Which of the species
is going to win?

01:18:22.587 --> 01:18:24.670
And let's go ahead and
vote, and see where we are.

01:18:24.670 --> 01:18:25.170
Ready?

01:18:25.170 --> 01:18:27.960
Three, two, one.

01:18:32.960 --> 01:18:35.231
So there's a slight
majority that

01:18:35.231 --> 01:18:36.980
are agreeing that in
this case, it's going

01:18:36.980 --> 01:18:40.320
to be that one is going to win.

01:18:40.320 --> 01:18:46.700
And I think that it's a little
bit hard to figure it out

01:18:46.700 --> 01:18:50.550
completely, but what I will say
is that in the case where we're

01:18:50.550 --> 01:18:54.940
down here, what this means is
that k1 divided nu beta 1,2

01:18:54.940 --> 01:18:58.020
is larger than k2.

01:18:58.020 --> 01:18:59.500
Now the question
says, what happens

01:18:59.500 --> 01:19:05.520
in the limit of-- If species
two does not hurt species one?

01:19:05.520 --> 01:19:10.330
Well that's when
beta 1,2 goes to 0.

01:19:10.330 --> 01:19:14.380
And that's the situation
where this goes up.

01:19:14.380 --> 01:19:17.360
So this is saying
that if the beta 1,2--

01:19:17.360 --> 01:19:19.290
And then we can figure
out where this line is

01:19:19.290 --> 01:19:25.370
as well, because this thing
is K2 divided by beta 2,1.

01:19:25.370 --> 01:19:28.150
So if species to
doesn't hurt to see one,

01:19:28.150 --> 01:19:31.597
but species one really
hurts species two,

01:19:31.597 --> 01:19:33.513
that's going to be the
limit where species one

01:19:33.513 --> 01:19:34.731
is going to win.

01:19:42.530 --> 01:19:45.870
We are out of time.

01:19:45.870 --> 01:19:52.000
Maybe what we'll do is
start class on Thursday

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.760
by-- I'll start with
this on the board,

01:19:54.760 --> 01:20:00.017
and then we'll complete
these four possibilities,

01:20:00.017 --> 01:20:01.600
to try to get some
intuition about it.

01:20:01.600 --> 01:20:04.050
And also draw these options.

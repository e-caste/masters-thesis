WEBVTT

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.620
PROFESSOR: Any questions before
we push bravely onward?

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.370
OK if there's no question
on any of this I shall

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:20.330
clean off the board.

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:25.550
And the last thing I wanted to
do in connection with thermal

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:31.030
expansion is to examine how the
macroscopic linear thermal

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:35.830
expansion coefficient relates to
the nature of the potential

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:37.080
minimum between--

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.970
in the attraction between--
neighboring atoms.

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:52.280
So let me suppose we have a
pair of atoms separated by

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:59.350
some distance, d, and there is
a cohesive force between them

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.040
or else the material would
not be in a solid state.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.115
And the nature of
the potential--

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:10.640
and I'm going to call
the distance

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.920
between the atoms, x--

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.090
and this is going to
be the energy.

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:29.990
And I'm measuring now
relative to--

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:35.150
let me call this d as I did over
here-- so the energy as a

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:39.800
function of d is going to
consist of a very short range,

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.930
repulsive interaction, that
rises very, very rapidly when

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:49.370
you attempt to squeeze the atoms
any closer than a fairly

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:51.190
small value.

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:56.560
And then there'll be some
sort of cohesive energy.

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.340
And everybody loves to model
ionic compounds because in an

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:09.130
ionic compound this cohesive
force would be purely a

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.840
Coulombic force that would be,
in rationalized MKS units, 1

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:20.590
over 4 pi epsilon zero times the
product of the charges and

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.100
divided by the distance
between them.

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.480
Taking those two potentials
together, and you've all seen

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:37.460
this many times before, there
is a minimum in the energy.

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:38.890
And then absolute zero--

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.340
that is the separation
at which this

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.130
atom pair would sit--

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:49.180
and this would be the binding
energy of that ionic pair.

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.070
If you carry this through to get
the entire energy of the

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:56.900
crystal, you find that the
energy of the crystal goes as

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.296
1 minus 1 over--

00:03:00.296 --> 00:03:02.060
haven't introduced
this term yet, so

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.310
let's hold off on that.

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:11.730
What I'm going to do now is to
take a look at this potential

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.870
and expand it around the
equilibrium separation just

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.350
with an empirical collection
of terms.

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:22.250
But from the shape of this well,
we can see why the bond

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.790
length should increase
as the energy of

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:28.520
the atomic pair increases.

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:36.020
At absolute zero, the separation
will be this

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:38.680
equilibrium separation,
d zero.

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.130
But as you increase the
temperature and pump

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:45.070
vibrational energy into this
pair of atoms, they will get a

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:48.860
certain increase in energy.

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:53.330
And as a result, the pair will
be able to vibrate between

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:54.520
these two limits.

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:57.610
Put in some more thermal
energy by raising the

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:00.830
temperature, and the pair will
be able to vibrate between

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:02.740
these limits--

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:04.510
larger limits.

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:09.440
And so the average position of
the atom, the separation of

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.740
the atoms, is something that
is going to increase with

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:14.630
increasing temperature.

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:17.800
And that is purely a consequence
of the asymmetry

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:21.660
in this potential well.

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:25.430
If this were a Coulombic bond,
we know exactly how to model

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:27.190
the attractive part.

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:30.460
The repulsive part is a little
harder to model because that

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:33.060
is something that's inherently
quantum mechanical.

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:36.160
As the ion pair gets close
together, the electrons start

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.910
to perturb each other's
orbitals.

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:43.890
And a very common thing to do
is to model this as 1 over d

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:46.290
to the sum power n.

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:50.530
And n is typically on the
order of 8 to 12.

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:56.210
So this is something that rises
very, very steeply.

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:00.170
I was once at the Gordon
conference where a fist fight

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:03.200
almost broke out because
somebody was giving a

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:06.360
presentation and started from
the beginning by introducing

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:07.870
this model to the
potential well.

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:10.950
And he says, "As usual, we'll
write this as a power law, 1

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:15.260
over d to the n." And somebody
in a front row jumped up and

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.550
said, "what do you
mean usually?

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:21.490
Sensible people use
exponentials." And the speaker

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:25.920
said, "No, I'm going to use
a power law." That's dumb.

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:27.700
Exponentials work better.

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:30.770
Power laws, exponentials, power
laws, exponentials.

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:35.120
But in point of fact they're
both grossly empirical and one

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:36.460
is not better than the other.

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:40.930
The algebra changes a little
bit, but people get very, very

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:43.510
emotionally attached to
their physical models.

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:46.205
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:46.205 --> 00:05:48.153
law in the exponential.

00:05:48.153 --> 00:05:50.831
PROFESSOR: Good, you should've
been there to

00:05:50.831 --> 00:05:52.536
break up the fight.

00:05:52.536 --> 00:05:53.997
If you'd gotten between them,
you'd have been likely punched

00:05:53.997 --> 00:05:54.971
in the nose.

00:05:54.971 --> 00:05:56.221
[INAUDIBLE]

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:01.180
OK so I'm going to use the power
law because as we've

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:04.010
seen they're the same thing
as exponentials.

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:07.390
So now what I'm going to do
is expand this in a purely

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:09.340
empirical way--

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:13.650
measuring distance from the
minimum of the potential well.

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:17.680
So what I'm going to say is
that the potential as a

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:20.670
function of x-- and now I won't
call it d because I'm

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:25.150
going to measure distance, x,
from the minimum in this well.

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:27.580
I'm going to say V is
a function of x.

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:31.970
There is a well in which the--

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:33.960
which keeps the atoms
separate.

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:37.270
I'll assume that is a parabolic
potential well, so

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:42.180
it'll go as first some constant
c times x squared.

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:44.070
Then the thing that
causes thermal

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:46.840
expansion is the asymmetry.

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:50.660
And I want the asymmetry to
increase the energy more

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:54.590
rapidly on the side of negative
x than on the side of

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:55.920
positive x.

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:58.335
So I'll put in a term,
g x cubed.

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:04.100
And I put a negative sign in
here because I want it to go

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:07.580
up as x becomes negative.

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:12.580
That means the ion pairs are
decreasing at separation.

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:19.750
And finally, a very fine touch,
if x becomes very

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:23.030
large, the potential
well should soften.

00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:26.700
The edges of this are starting
to level out and get lower

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:30.730
than the purely parabolic part
for very large separations.

00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:32.730
So that's what I'll use
as a very simple

00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:36.640
model for my potential.

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:41.910
This is what gives the
asymmetry, and this is what

00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:43.160
gives softening.

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:51.700
And now I'm going to ask, what
is the average value of x?

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:58.430
The probability of finding a
particular x is going to be

00:07:58.430 --> 00:08:09.180
proportional to e to the
minus V of x over kt.

00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:13.840
So I can say that the average
value of x is going to be the

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:19.640
integral from minus infinity to
plus infinity of the value

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:23.260
that I'm trying to find the
average of, namely x times the

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.480
probability of finding that x.

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:28.670
And that's going to e to the
minus V of x over kt.

00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:36.929
And I will integrate
that over x.

00:08:36.929 --> 00:08:40.570
And then I will normalize by a
term which is the integral of

00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:44.230
the probability from minus
infinity to plus infinity of e

00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:48.420
to the minus V of x over kt.

00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:50.440
So that's a general expression
for an average.

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:52.820
It's the thing you want to
average times the probability

00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:57.220
of finding the particular value
divided by the integral

00:08:57.220 --> 00:08:58.470
of the probabilities.

00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:05.220
OK now let me do some very
straightforward things and I'm

00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:08.600
just going to rattle these
off very quickly.

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:13.350
We'll expand this in terms
of a series of terms.

00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:22.830
And I'm going to expand both the
numerator and denominator

00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:26.640
using the approximation that
e to the u is approximately

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:30.380
equal to 1 plus u.

00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:32.090
So the numerator--

00:09:32.090 --> 00:09:39.930
x times e to the minus
cx squared over kt.

00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:45.620
I'm going to take the higher
order terms and say that e to

00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:54.080
the gx cubed over kt times
e to the minus--

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:56.840
this is a minus sign
out in front--

00:09:56.840 --> 00:10:02.300
times e to the fx fourth over
kt, can be approximated by,

00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:06.660
since these are very, very small
terms, 1 plus g x cubed

00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:14.590
over kt times 1 plus
fx fourth over kt.

00:10:14.590 --> 00:10:18.530
So that's going to be, if I
put an x e to the minus cx

00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:25.000
squared, I'm going to have a
term 1 plus g x cubed over kt,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.180
plus f x fourth over kt.

00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:33.210
And then a very, very minuscule
term, f times g

00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:36.650
times x to the 7th over kt.

00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:37.900
And I'm going to
throw that out.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.460
If I look at these integrals
one at a time, the integral

00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:52.560
from minus infinity to plus
infinity of x e to the minus

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:56.230
cx squared over k t, that's
the first term in

00:10:56.230 --> 00:10:58.720
expansion, times dx.

00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:00.860
That's going to be zero.

00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:03.180
Because for positive x,
the thing that we're

00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:05.030
integrating is plus.

00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:08.590
For negative x, the thing that
we're integrating has the same

00:11:08.590 --> 00:11:11.000
exponential but has
a minus sign.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.830
So that integral is zero.

00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:25.250
So the next term I want
to look at is x times

00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:28.330
gx cubed over kt.

00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:34.880
And for this I turned to my
handy book of integrals.

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:39.030
The integral from zero to
infinity of x to the 2n, where

00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:44.400
that quantity is even, times e
to the minus a x squared dx,

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:49.010
is equal to, as you all know, 1
times 3 times 5 all the way

00:11:49.010 --> 00:11:56.270
up to 2n minus 1 divided by 2 to
the n plus 1 times a to the

00:11:56.270 --> 00:11:59.660
n times the square root
of pi over a.

00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:04.080
And proof of that the integral
is left as an exercise to the

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:06.290
reckless student.

00:12:06.290 --> 00:12:06.625
Yes?

00:12:06.625 --> 00:12:07.952
AUDIENCE: The x cubed
[INAUDIBLE].

00:12:10.928 --> 00:12:14.896
PROFESSOR: That's why
this is a 2n here.

00:12:14.896 --> 00:12:17.624
So I can say that the x cubed
term is--but we don't have an

00:12:17.624 --> 00:12:18.368
x cubed term.

00:12:18.368 --> 00:12:24.320
The next term is going to
be equal to x fourth.

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:27.086
And this I'm going to
drop because that's

00:12:27.086 --> 00:12:28.610
going to be x fifth.

00:12:28.610 --> 00:12:43.730
So the integral from minus
infinity to plus infinity of x

00:12:43.730 --> 00:12:52.850
to the fourth power times g over
kt times e to the minus

00:12:52.850 --> 00:12:56.480
cx squared over kt dx.

00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:59.110
If I use this formula,
turns out to be a

00:12:59.110 --> 00:13:00.480
very, very simple thing.

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:05.520
It turns out to be 3/4 times the
square root of pi times g

00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:15.980
times kt over c to the 5/2.

00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:20.010
And kt is to the power 3/2.

00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:25.880
So that is--

00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:32.520
if I throw away the term in x
times x fourth which is odd,

00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:36.800
that will vanish and I've then
thrown out only a really large

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:39.530
term in x to the 7th.

00:13:39.530 --> 00:13:56.570
For the denominator, the
integral that is there before

00:13:56.570 --> 00:14:03.480
us is the integral from minus
infinity to plus infinity of e

00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:11.810
to the minus cx squared
over kt times 1 plus g

00:14:11.810 --> 00:14:16.450
x cubed over kt.

00:14:16.450 --> 00:14:19.580
This thing is going to vanish
because x is odd.

00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:24.530
And then I'll have plus
fx fourth over kt.

00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:27.320
That will not vanish but it's
going to be a relatively small

00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:29.390
term, so I'll go like that.

00:14:29.390 --> 00:14:31.770
Which means I just
have to integrate

00:14:31.770 --> 00:14:33.760
this Gaussian factor.

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:39.070
And that turns out to be equal
to 2 times 1/2 times square

00:14:39.070 --> 00:14:47.850
root of pi kT pi
times T over c.

00:14:47.850 --> 00:14:49.100
So this is the denominator.

00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:57.645
And if I take the ratio of those
two integrals, I have

00:14:57.645 --> 00:15:04.230
that the average value of x will
be equal to 3/4 square

00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:17.950
root of pi times g times kt to
the 3/2 over c to the 5/2,

00:15:17.950 --> 00:15:24.200
divided by the square root
of pi times kt over c

00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:26.630
to the power 1/2.

00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:29.560
And if I carry through the
algebra correctly, this turns

00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:35.745
out to be 3/4 of g over
c squared times kt.

00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:45.730
So there is the average distance
between this pair of

00:15:45.730 --> 00:15:49.480
atoms as a function of
temperature in terms of

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:53.420
characteristics of
the potential.

00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:57.040
The first thing that is very
gratifying is that the bond

00:15:57.040 --> 00:16:00.240
length, according to the simple
model, should increase

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:02.160
linearly with temperature.

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:05.970
So it tells us we would expect
things to expand linearly with

00:16:05.970 --> 00:16:11.260
temperature which corresponds
to reality.

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:15.360
The next thing we'll see is that
the amount of expansion

00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:19.360
goes inversely as the square.

00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:20.810
That's a strong dependence--

00:16:20.810 --> 00:16:23.060
inversely as the square of the

00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:25.930
parabolic part of our potential.

00:16:25.930 --> 00:16:29.230
That was the c-- c was the
coefficient in front of cx

00:16:29.230 --> 00:16:31.300
squared in our potential.

00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:35.800
So the stronger the bond, the
smaller the thermal expansion

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:40.050
coefficient is in proportion
to the reciprocal of the

00:16:40.050 --> 00:16:43.360
square of that term.

00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:46.840
And then finally, the last
important term to survive is

00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:48.650
g, the asymmetry.

00:16:48.650 --> 00:16:51.280
And the thermal expansion
coefficient should increase

00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:55.070
with the first power of the
term that describes the

00:16:55.070 --> 00:16:56.560
asymmetry of the
potential well.

00:17:00.010 --> 00:17:02.970
So your intuition would
tell you that

00:17:02.970 --> 00:17:05.140
that's the way the thermal--

00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:07.380
linear thermal expansion
coefficient should vary.

00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:11.250
The interesting thing is that
it depends more strongly on

00:17:11.250 --> 00:17:14.450
the parameter that gives the
parabolic part of the

00:17:14.450 --> 00:17:15.710
potential well.

00:17:15.710 --> 00:17:18.960
And secondly, that it does
predict a thermal expansion

00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:21.680
coefficient that increases--

00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:24.579
the separation that
increases with--

00:17:24.579 --> 00:17:25.960
in proportion to temperature.

00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:29.250
And therefore there is a
constant linear thermal

00:17:29.250 --> 00:17:32.300
expansion coefficient.

00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:34.730
Now all this is true at
elevated temperatures.

00:17:34.730 --> 00:17:38.340
At low temperatures,
thermodynamics kicks in.

00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:40.990
And it turns out that the
linear thermal expansion

00:17:40.990 --> 00:17:45.820
coefficient, as does energies of
vibrating atoms, must go to

00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:50.880
zero as temperature approaches
absolute zero.

00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:55.920
So a typical variation of the
thermal expansion coefficient

00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:59.050
with temperature is something
that does this.

00:17:59.050 --> 00:18:02.330
The same way as-- the same sort
of variation as things

00:18:02.330 --> 00:18:03.750
like heat capacity.

00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:07.550
And this temperature in here is
on the order of the Debye

00:18:07.550 --> 00:18:09.780
temperature of the particular
material.

00:18:15.930 --> 00:18:21.650
All right, so much for linear
thermal expansion.

00:18:21.650 --> 00:18:28.730
And I would now like to turn
to something much more

00:18:28.730 --> 00:18:30.110
interesting.

00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:35.920
And that is physical properties
that involve

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:38.595
property tensors of rank
higher than two.

00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:55.140
One of the important and more
interesting of these is a

00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:56.560
property called
piezoelectricity.

00:19:04.350 --> 00:19:08.490
Piezo means pressure, so the
property literally means

00:19:08.490 --> 00:19:12.770
pressure electricity or pressure
induced charge.

00:19:19.470 --> 00:19:20.720
Now what is the charge?

00:19:24.450 --> 00:19:29.810
First of all, this does not
describe a property where-- if

00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:33.320
I were to pick up a chunk of
crystal, and I drop it because

00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:35.890
I just got an electric charge.

00:19:35.890 --> 00:19:39.510
These are not mobile charges,
these are bound charges.

00:19:39.510 --> 00:19:46.120
And the reason for the induced
charge is the fact that we are

00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:50.740
squeezing or stretching an ionic
material, and that's

00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:53.390
moving charged ions around.

00:19:53.390 --> 00:19:56.960
So what we're going to do if
that process involves motion

00:19:56.960 --> 00:20:01.600
of charged ions is to induce a
dipole moment per unit volume.

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:08.550
I have a little primer on some
quantities in electromagnetic

00:20:08.550 --> 00:20:10.440
theory and I--

00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:13.230
I brought them with me upstairs
to look them over and

00:20:13.230 --> 00:20:14.390
I forgot to bring them down.

00:20:14.390 --> 00:20:16.320
But I don't think we'll
need them in what's

00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:17.990
left of this hour.

00:20:17.990 --> 00:20:25.590
So let me say that for matter
and bulk, the quantity that is

00:20:25.590 --> 00:20:28.213
involved in piezoelectricity
is the polarization.

00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:34.260
And polarization is dipole
moment per unit volume.

00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:47.930
And a dipole moment, to refresh
your memory, is that

00:20:47.930 --> 00:20:55.670
if I have a positive charge
plus q and negative charge

00:20:55.670 --> 00:21:01.080
minus q separated by
a distance, d.

00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:05.940
The dipole moment, which I'll
indicate by a lowercase p, has

00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:10.790
a vector quality and it's equal
to the magnitude of one

00:21:10.790 --> 00:21:17.240
of these charges times the
distance between them.

00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:22.140
And we'll define the distance
as going from the positive

00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:24.875
charge to the negative charge.

00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:34.220
That's a crazy way of defining a
pair of charges of equal but

00:21:34.220 --> 00:21:36.480
opposite sign.

00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:40.050
The reason for defining a
quantity like the dipole

00:21:40.050 --> 00:21:44.150
moment is that this combination
of charge and

00:21:44.150 --> 00:21:46.910
separation of the charges
comes up in all sorts of

00:21:46.910 --> 00:21:51.240
problems in electrostatics
and electrodynamics.

00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:52.900
And this is the delight
of people who

00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:55.270
teach elementary physics.

00:21:55.270 --> 00:21:59.610
You are given, on the first
quiz, a question that says--

00:21:59.610 --> 00:22:04.350
calculate the electric field
that is created by a set of

00:22:04.350 --> 00:22:08.210
dipoles on the Great Court
which spell out MIT.

00:22:08.210 --> 00:22:12.130
And we can come up with all
sorts of crazy configurations

00:22:12.130 --> 00:22:16.350
of dipoles and then calculate
the field that they produce.

00:22:16.350 --> 00:22:20.420
And the field turns out to be
something that always involves

00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:26.120
the product of charge and
separation in a vector sense.

00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:30.450
Probably the best illustration
of this would be if I have a

00:22:30.450 --> 00:22:34.710
dipole charge plus q, charge
minus q, separated by d.

00:22:34.710 --> 00:22:38.330
And I put it in the
electric field.

00:22:38.330 --> 00:22:41.780
The electric field, which is
defined as the force per unit

00:22:41.780 --> 00:22:45.050
charge on a positive charge is
going to pull the positive

00:22:45.050 --> 00:22:46.590
charge this way.

00:22:46.590 --> 00:22:48.880
And it's going to pull the
negative charge this way.

00:22:51.380 --> 00:22:53.630
And what that's going
to do is to place a

00:22:53.630 --> 00:22:56.040
torque on the dipole.

00:22:56.040 --> 00:23:04.880
And that torque is going to be
equal to a vector product of

00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:08.550
the electric field
and a vector.

00:23:08.550 --> 00:23:13.440
You can express it in terms of
the separation of charges

00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:17.220
defined in a vector sense going
from the positive charge

00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:19.580
to the negative charge.

00:23:19.580 --> 00:23:23.400
So there's an example of how
the torque on a dipole

00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:29.470
directly involves the product
of charge and the separation

00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:34.010
between them and the
angle between the

00:23:34.010 --> 00:23:36.260
field and the dipole.

00:23:36.260 --> 00:23:39.440
So it's a useful quality and,
without further apology, we

00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:40.690
will use it in our discussion.

00:23:43.550 --> 00:23:45.010
Now polarization--

00:23:45.010 --> 00:23:47.150
dipole moment per unit volume--
is just going to be

00:23:47.150 --> 00:23:51.390
the dipole moment of one dipole
pair times the number

00:23:51.390 --> 00:23:53.000
of them per unit volume.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:58.630
And that will be a macroscopic
measure of polarization.

00:24:02.530 --> 00:24:10.930
OK, if we subject a piece of
material that contains ions to

00:24:10.930 --> 00:24:15.970
a stress- so here is a stress
tensor, sigma ij.

00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:23.420
Let me call it jk.

00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:28.870
We will create reorientation
of the dipoles.

00:24:28.870 --> 00:24:34.110
We will have a polarization, a
dipole moment per unit volume.

00:24:34.110 --> 00:24:41.190
This will be a vector because
there will be some net dipole

00:24:41.190 --> 00:24:42.350
moment per unit volume.

00:24:42.350 --> 00:24:44.950
And that will just be the sum
of all the little individual

00:24:44.950 --> 00:24:48.220
dipole moments on the ions--

00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:49.820
ion pairs.

00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:57.390
And if the stress is not too
large, every component of

00:24:57.390 --> 00:25:02.300
polarization is going to be
given by a linear combination

00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:04.960
of every one of the components
of stress.

00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:13.150
So we will have an array of
coefficients, d ijk The i goes

00:25:13.150 --> 00:25:17.745
with the P and the
j and k goes with

00:25:17.745 --> 00:25:21.930
the elements of stress.

00:25:21.930 --> 00:25:23.870
This is something that's
called the direct

00:25:23.870 --> 00:25:25.120
piezoelectric effect.

00:25:39.930 --> 00:25:43.870
It's the basis of a lot
of every day devices--

00:25:43.870 --> 00:25:49.090
pick ups on the old records
which nobody uses anymore,

00:25:49.090 --> 00:25:51.760
cigarette lighter which nobody
uses anymore because

00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:53.560
everybody's quit smoking--

00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:57.650
but worked the cigarette
lighter, in some of the more

00:25:57.650 --> 00:26:00.570
modern incarnations of
the lighter, was the

00:26:00.570 --> 00:26:03.980
piezoelectric effect.

00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:07.880
It's important to note that the
charges that are involved

00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:10.660
in the piezoelectric effect
are bound charges.

00:26:10.660 --> 00:26:14.040
Again you can't get a shock
by picking up a piece of a

00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:18.200
strongly piezoelectric
material like quartz.

00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:22.270
Might say then, well if there's
no spark, how could a

00:26:22.270 --> 00:26:27.090
piezoelectric material in a
cigarette lighter cause the

00:26:27.090 --> 00:26:30.875
lighter fuel to ignite.

00:26:30.875 --> 00:26:32.600
The charge doesn't move.

00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:33.960
How could there be a spark?

00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:36.740
How could the lighter
fluid be ignited?

00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:37.990
Anybody got an idea?

00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:47.570
Charge can induce current flow
in circuit elements that are

00:26:47.570 --> 00:26:49.200
removed from the charge.

00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:53.050
So if you have a little
capacitor in the lighter that

00:26:53.050 --> 00:26:56.770
is near the piezoelectric
element that will develop the

00:26:56.770 --> 00:27:01.740
charge, you can induce current
flow in a circuit as a result

00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:05.680
of that capacitor experiencing
the electric charge of the

00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:09.000
piezoelectric induced charge.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:12.050
And that's how the little
piezoelectric cigarette

00:27:12.050 --> 00:27:13.900
lighters worked.

00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:17.020
OK, this stress--

00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:22.960
array of stress elements, nine
of them, constitutes a tensor

00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:24.450
of second rank.

00:27:24.450 --> 00:27:31.040
Polarization is a vector
per unit volume.

00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:33.910
This is a tensor
of first rank.

00:27:33.910 --> 00:27:35.890
This is a tensor
of second rank.

00:27:35.890 --> 00:27:40.070
Therefore it follows that this
array of coefficients, d ijk

00:27:40.070 --> 00:27:44.100
will be three equations
involving all

00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:46.700
nine elements of stress.

00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:54.790
So it'll be a total of 27
coefficients in the array.

00:27:54.790 --> 00:27:58.465
And this array constitutes a
tensor of the third rank.

00:28:06.340 --> 00:28:10.770
So this is clearly a property
tensor which relates a

00:28:10.770 --> 00:28:12.480
generalized force--

00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:18.500
the stress tensor to a
generalized displacement,

00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:20.420
which is the dipole moment
per unit volume.

00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:37.830
Since this is a property of
a crystal, that tensor is

00:28:37.830 --> 00:28:41.860
subject to symmetry
restrictions.

00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:48.550
In particular, if there is some
direction, cosine scheme

00:28:48.550 --> 00:28:53.010
Cij, that corresponds to the
operation of a symmetry

00:28:53.010 --> 00:29:08.470
element, then it follows that if
we evaluate the new tensor

00:29:08.470 --> 00:29:16.760
elements, d ijk prime in terms
of the old elements, that is

00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:27.190
going to be a transformation
of the form Cil, Cjm, Ckn

00:29:27.190 --> 00:29:31.555
times all 27 of the original
tensor elements, d lmn.

00:29:36.030 --> 00:29:41.950
And the l, m, and n are dummy
indices, just as with our

00:29:41.950 --> 00:29:43.200
second rank tensors.

00:29:49.014 --> 00:29:55.980
And the ijk are real indices
that go with the subscripts on

00:29:55.980 --> 00:29:57.920
the particular tensor element.

00:30:00.850 --> 00:30:03.365
So there are 27 coefficients.

00:30:10.970 --> 00:30:18.760
And each transformed element is
going to be a sum therefore

00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:27.080
of 27 coefficients times--

00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:29.790
each times three direction
cosines.

00:30:36.910 --> 00:30:40.800
So each transform tensor element
is going to be given

00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:46.195
by a sum of 3 times
27 quantities.

00:30:49.980 --> 00:30:52.700
And to do the complete
transformation would involve

00:30:52.700 --> 00:30:55.470
doing it 27 times.

00:30:55.470 --> 00:31:01.710
So 3 times 27 squared is the
number of terms that we're

00:31:01.710 --> 00:31:06.030
going to have to write down to
transform the entire tensor.

00:31:06.030 --> 00:31:11.380
Not a terribly encouraging
prospect unless you use the

00:31:11.380 --> 00:31:18.310
method of direct inspection,
namely that the tensor

00:31:18.310 --> 00:31:21.920
transforms like the product of
the corresponding coordinates.

00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:24.180
And then it works fairly
quickly, particularly for

00:31:24.180 --> 00:31:27.540
symmetry transformations, where
there are a lot of zeros

00:31:27.540 --> 00:31:28.980
in the direction
cosine scheme.

00:31:32.050 --> 00:31:36.400
So we're going to have to do
this for each of the crystal--

00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:38.170
crystal point groups.

00:31:38.170 --> 00:31:41.340
So we're going to have to do
this exercise of 3 times 27

00:31:41.340 --> 00:31:46.620
times 27 times the 32 point
groups that exist, which

00:31:46.620 --> 00:31:49.380
becomes an even more
daunting task.

00:31:49.380 --> 00:31:53.370
But let's do one such
transformation and let me show

00:31:53.370 --> 00:32:00.780
you that it, in fact, it's going
to go fairly easily.

00:32:00.780 --> 00:32:04.340
So let me follow the tracks of
what we did with second rank

00:32:04.340 --> 00:32:06.000
tensors and examine the

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:11.550
restrictions imposed by inversion.

00:32:23.070 --> 00:32:27.250
OK so the transformation of
the axes, as we've seen

00:32:27.250 --> 00:32:30.190
before, that's produced
by 1 bar.

00:32:30.190 --> 00:32:33.435
That's going to take
x1 and change its

00:32:33.435 --> 00:32:35.240
direction to minus x1.

00:32:40.050 --> 00:32:44.940
It's going to take x2 and change
its sense to an x2

00:32:44.940 --> 00:32:46.950
prime that points in
this direction.

00:32:46.950 --> 00:32:50.020
And take x3 and change its
sense to something

00:32:50.020 --> 00:32:52.340
that points down here.

00:32:52.340 --> 00:32:54.070
So that's x3 prime.

00:32:54.070 --> 00:32:57.650
So the relation between the
axes, before and after

00:32:57.650 --> 00:33:00.720
inversion, is that x1
prime equals x1--

00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:02.380
minus x1--

00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:05.220
x2 prime is equal to minus x2.

00:33:05.220 --> 00:33:10.900
And x3 prime is equal
to minus x3.

00:33:10.900 --> 00:33:12.240
And we've seen this before.

00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:13.900
It's deja vu all over again.

00:33:13.900 --> 00:33:17.610
So Cij, the direction cosine
scheme, is equal

00:33:17.610 --> 00:33:19.810
to minus 1, 0, 0.

00:33:19.810 --> 00:33:21.710
0, minus 1, 0.

00:33:21.710 --> 00:33:23.720
0, 0, minus 1.

00:33:26.450 --> 00:33:32.060
So let's transform a
representative tensor element

00:33:32.060 --> 00:33:36.280
for a change of axes that
corresponds to that direction

00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:37.620
cosine scheme.

00:33:37.620 --> 00:33:39.950
And that's the same as
physically inverting the

00:33:39.950 --> 00:33:43.830
crystal and demanding that the
property be unchanged if that

00:33:43.830 --> 00:33:45.630
is a symmetry transformation
which

00:33:45.630 --> 00:33:48.160
leaves the crystal invariant.

00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:59.670
So if we look at some d ijk
prime, that's going to be Cil,

00:33:59.670 --> 00:34:09.900
Cjm, Ckn, d lmn, where this is
a sum over the index l, the

00:34:09.900 --> 00:34:20.280
dummy index m, and the double
index n, from 1 to 3.

00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:27.159
If we sum over Ci something, the
only term of the form Ci

00:34:27.159 --> 00:34:30.900
something, regardless of what
i is, is going to be the

00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:40.310
diagonal term Cii, the diagonal
direction cosine Cii.

00:34:40.310 --> 00:34:44.190
In other words, if i were 1, the
only term of the form C1

00:34:44.190 --> 00:34:47.900
something that is non-zero,
is C11.

00:34:47.900 --> 00:35:00.010
If I sum over m, the only term
that is non-zero is C, with m

00:35:00.010 --> 00:35:00.770
equal to j.

00:35:00.770 --> 00:35:02.730
So this is going to be Cjj.

00:35:02.730 --> 00:35:05.160
And if I sum over n, the
only term that is going

00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:08.750
to be left is Ckk.

00:35:08.750 --> 00:35:14.490
And all this will be
times d ijk, the

00:35:14.490 --> 00:35:16.530
single tensor element.

00:35:16.530 --> 00:35:19.900
Regardless of the values of i,
j, and k, they are all equal

00:35:19.900 --> 00:35:21.150
to minus 1.

00:35:23.450 --> 00:35:29.480
So the operation then of
inversion, then says that for

00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:34.440
the transformed crystal, d ijk
prime for any i, j, and k, is

00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:36.957
going to be equal
to minus d ijk.

00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:43.800
But if this is a symmetry
transformation, the tensor

00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:46.580
element has to be the same
before and after.

00:35:46.580 --> 00:35:49.740
And the only number which can
be equal to the negative of

00:35:49.740 --> 00:35:51.100
itself is zero.

00:35:54.250 --> 00:35:58.610
So we have, with
one swell foop,

00:35:58.610 --> 00:36:02.600
transformed 27th tensor elements--

00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:06.270
each one of them a sum
of 27 elements in

00:36:06.270 --> 00:36:07.550
the original tensor.

00:36:07.550 --> 00:36:11.920
So the conclusion is, if a
crystal has the operation of

00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:17.795
inversion, all d ijk vanish.

00:36:22.170 --> 00:36:24.170
What does that mean?

00:36:24.170 --> 00:36:25.800
Means the property just
doesn't exist.

00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:35.640
So no crystal which has an
inversion center can display

00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:36.890
piezoelectricity.

00:36:43.190 --> 00:36:46.510
Which means that none of the
11 Laue groups can be

00:36:46.510 --> 00:36:48.310
piezoelectric.

00:36:48.310 --> 00:36:52.090
And the only point groups
for crystals that can be

00:36:52.090 --> 00:37:17.950
piezoelectric are the 32
minus 11 equals 21--

00:37:17.950 --> 00:37:20.800
and this isn't even one
of my good days--

00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:23.840
acentric point groups--

00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:25.605
the noncentrosymmetric
point groups.

00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:43.400
And, these, in principle,
can be all different.

00:38:10.710 --> 00:38:13.210
So we can't get away with just
looking at the restrictions of

00:38:13.210 --> 00:38:16.200
Laue groups as we did with
second rank tensors.

00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:19.910
We're going to have to look at
every one of the point groups

00:38:19.910 --> 00:38:21.840
that have no inversion center.

00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:25.130
And these can, in principle,
be different, and

00:38:25.130 --> 00:38:26.380
they usually are.

00:38:45.250 --> 00:38:49.370
Let me give you a physically--

00:38:49.370 --> 00:38:53.980
physical feeling for why the
piezoelectric effect cannot

00:38:53.980 --> 00:38:59.130
exist for a crystal that has
an inversion center in it.

00:38:59.130 --> 00:39:04.050
Let's suppose we cut a wafer
from our single crystal,

00:39:04.050 --> 00:39:05.300
regardless of orientation.

00:39:13.380 --> 00:39:15.870
And we subject it to a
compressive stress.

00:39:23.490 --> 00:39:24.690
We will see--

00:39:24.690 --> 00:39:29.080
and I've got a primer on some
simple electrostatics that may

00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:29.990
be useful--

00:39:29.990 --> 00:39:42.590
that a polarization in the x1
direction manifests itself as

00:39:42.590 --> 00:39:48.430
a charge per unit area on the
surface and an opposite charge

00:39:48.430 --> 00:39:49.990
on the other surface.

00:39:49.990 --> 00:39:58.090
So P1 corresponds, numerically
and physically, to a charge

00:39:58.090 --> 00:40:06.200
per unit area on a surface
that's normal to x1.

00:40:16.450 --> 00:40:20.040
OK now let's suppose that that
crystal has an inversion

00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:21.290
center in it.

00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:29.050
And that means we should be able
to invert the crystal and

00:40:29.050 --> 00:40:33.810
measure exactly the same
charge per unit area.

00:40:33.810 --> 00:40:38.550
Well, if this is surface a, and
this is surface b, we can

00:40:38.550 --> 00:40:44.500
imagine ourselves doing the
thought experiment in which we

00:40:44.500 --> 00:40:45.880
invert the crystal.

00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:51.270
So this surface becomes b and
this surface becomes a.

00:40:51.270 --> 00:40:55.040
And we apply the same
sigma along x1--

00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:56.310
a compressive stress.

00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:03.300
It's really doing exactly the
same thing that we were doing

00:41:03.300 --> 00:41:05.550
before-- inverting
the crystal.

00:41:05.550 --> 00:41:09.000
And now we say that the property
has to stay the same.

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:15.470
So now we are demanding that
surface b have a positive

00:41:15.470 --> 00:41:19.180
charge per unit area, and
surface a develop a negative

00:41:19.180 --> 00:41:20.960
charge per unit area--

00:41:20.960 --> 00:41:23.740
completely the reverse of
what happened here.

00:41:23.740 --> 00:41:25.820
But yet what we're doing is
just squeezing the plate.

00:41:25.820 --> 00:41:27.630
The crystal can't tell
which side is up,

00:41:27.630 --> 00:41:28.460
which side is down.

00:41:28.460 --> 00:41:31.330
We're applying the same
compressive effect.

00:41:31.330 --> 00:41:35.110
So these two distributions of
charge are not the same and

00:41:35.110 --> 00:41:38.810
can be the same only if
that charge is zero.

00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:45.135
So physically we can see why
the crystal can't be

00:41:45.135 --> 00:41:45.850
piezoelectric.

00:41:45.850 --> 00:41:47.540
If you don't like to invert
the crystal--

00:41:47.540 --> 00:41:51.640
if you can't do that
physically--

00:41:51.640 --> 00:41:54.980
one thing we can do is leave the
crystal alone and invert

00:41:54.980 --> 00:41:57.680
the compressive stress.

00:41:57.680 --> 00:42:01.070
So this is sigma top and this
is sigma bottom which is

00:42:01.070 --> 00:42:04.930
exactly equal to it but
opposite in direction.

00:42:04.930 --> 00:42:06.830
If we invert the stress
relative--

00:42:12.640 --> 00:42:13.915
relative to the crystal--

00:42:16.940 --> 00:42:21.448
then what we've done is
to take sigma top--

00:42:21.448 --> 00:42:23.080
leave the crystal alone--

00:42:23.080 --> 00:42:26.535
so this is now the sigma that
was squishing the top.

00:42:26.535 --> 00:42:34.460
Here's the sigma that was
squishing the bottom and well,

00:42:34.460 --> 00:42:37.090
that's clearly doing
the same thing.

00:42:37.090 --> 00:42:40.980
So inverting the stress,
relative to the crystal, is

00:42:40.980 --> 00:42:43.130
the same as inverting
the crystal

00:42:43.130 --> 00:42:44.960
relative to the stress.

00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:48.980
And nothing is supposed to
happen but clearly the sign of

00:42:48.980 --> 00:42:52.430
the charge is going
to be reversed.

00:42:52.430 --> 00:42:53.410
So that just won't work.

00:42:53.410 --> 00:42:54.660
The charge has to disappear.

00:43:02.370 --> 00:43:04.770
OK this is the direct
piezoelectric effect.

00:43:04.770 --> 00:43:08.950
It can exist only for crystals
that lack an inversion center.

00:43:08.950 --> 00:43:11.983
Let me mention some other
piezoelectric effects.

00:43:17.970 --> 00:43:28.760
So we mentioned that a
polarization, given by a third

00:43:28.760 --> 00:43:35.620
rank tensor times an applied
stress, sigma ij, is the

00:43:35.620 --> 00:43:37.470
direct piezoelectric
photoelectric effect.

00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:55.020
However, if we have a stress,
we also have a strain.

00:43:55.020 --> 00:43:58.750
So another piezoelectric effect,
which is not dignified

00:43:58.750 --> 00:44:04.200
with a name, is that we can
apply a stress that creates a

00:44:04.200 --> 00:44:06.910
given state of strain.

00:44:06.910 --> 00:44:12.820
And we again, we'll get a
polarization per unit--

00:44:12.820 --> 00:44:15.440
a charge per unit area
of polarization.

00:44:15.440 --> 00:44:18.690
And this is a set of
coefficients which are

00:44:18.690 --> 00:44:20.900
represented by e.

00:44:20.900 --> 00:44:25.870
And we can write a tensor
relation of this sort-- that

00:44:25.870 --> 00:44:30.040
components of polarization,
charge per unit area, normal

00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:35.910
to axis xi, is given by a linear
combination of every

00:44:35.910 --> 00:44:38.700
one of the components
of strain.

00:44:38.700 --> 00:44:43.090
This is something that is not
dignified by any name.

00:44:51.300 --> 00:44:57.010
And clearly, the piezoelectric
coefficients, e, have to be

00:44:57.010 --> 00:45:03.570
related to the piezoelectric
coefficients, d, by the

00:45:03.570 --> 00:45:05.690
elastic constant somehow--

00:45:05.690 --> 00:45:07.360
unless we are doing
the same thing.

00:45:07.360 --> 00:45:11.310
We've got to create a stress,
operationally, in order to

00:45:11.310 --> 00:45:12.910
create the strain.

00:45:12.910 --> 00:45:15.600
So a stress creates a strain.

00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:19.870
And that has to describe the
same polarization if we've

00:45:19.870 --> 00:45:21.100
done the same thing.

00:45:21.100 --> 00:45:24.740
So the e's and the d's
have to be related.

00:45:24.740 --> 00:45:30.630
Another piezoelectric effect
involves a applying an

00:45:30.630 --> 00:45:33.950
electric field.

00:45:33.950 --> 00:45:38.530
And if we apply an electric
field, we will in general

00:45:38.530 --> 00:45:39.780
create a strain.

00:45:46.070 --> 00:45:53.870
This direct piezoelectric effect
is three equations that

00:45:53.870 --> 00:46:01.960
involve a linear combination
of nine elements of stress.

00:46:01.960 --> 00:46:06.900
This piezoelectric relation
here is going to involve

00:46:06.900 --> 00:46:12.130
writing an equation for each
of nine elements of strain.

00:46:12.130 --> 00:46:14.850
And there would be three
components of the electric

00:46:14.850 --> 00:46:15.750
field vector.

00:46:15.750 --> 00:46:17.070
So it'll be three this way.

00:46:17.070 --> 00:46:20.135
So both of these relations
involve 27 elements.

00:46:22.910 --> 00:46:25.960
So again we're going to have a
third rank tensor because the

00:46:25.960 --> 00:46:27.360
electric field is a vector--

00:46:27.360 --> 00:46:28.930
strain is a tensor.

00:46:28.930 --> 00:46:33.510
And now the mind boggling thing
that I will leave you

00:46:33.510 --> 00:46:42.280
with is exactly the same set of
coefficients, d ij describe

00:46:42.280 --> 00:46:44.670
both effects.

00:46:44.670 --> 00:46:47.120
And this effect is given
a special name.

00:46:47.120 --> 00:46:49.740
This is called the converse
piezoelectric effect.

00:46:54.880 --> 00:47:01.750
And it's not at all clear how
strain, in terms of electric

00:47:01.750 --> 00:47:06.930
field, should be described in
terms of the same array of 27

00:47:06.930 --> 00:47:10.320
numbers as polarization
per unit

00:47:10.320 --> 00:47:12.780
volume in terms of stress.

00:47:12.780 --> 00:47:18.070
And that is an argument that
is based on thermodynamics.

00:47:18.070 --> 00:47:21.790
So that's a good
place to quit.

00:47:21.790 --> 00:47:26.680
We'll have some fun in looking
at a few symmetry restrictions

00:47:26.680 --> 00:47:32.670
imposed on the acentric point
groups, 21 of them.

00:47:32.670 --> 00:47:34.210
We're not going to do all 21.

00:47:34.210 --> 00:47:37.520
If you know how to do one or
two, and marvel over the

00:47:37.520 --> 00:47:41.470
results, you can do them all.

00:47:41.470 --> 00:47:45.630
But one thing that we'll be
asking is how can we represent

00:47:45.630 --> 00:47:50.430
the variation of the
piezoelectric effect with

00:47:50.430 --> 00:47:51.820
orientation of the crystal.

00:47:54.430 --> 00:47:58.155
And the answer is we can't.

00:47:58.155 --> 00:47:58.810
We can't.

00:47:58.810 --> 00:48:04.770
Because what is the direction
of what we're doing?

00:48:04.770 --> 00:48:08.790
There are nine elements of
stress, not just three

00:48:08.790 --> 00:48:11.930
components of a vector which
defines an orientation.

00:48:11.930 --> 00:48:14.000
There are nine parameters
here.

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:17.620
And there are three components
to the charge per unit area--

00:48:17.620 --> 00:48:19.230
that's a vector.

00:48:19.230 --> 00:48:22.600
So all that one can do for these
higher ranked tensors is

00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:27.870
to look for a special,
generalized force.

00:48:27.870 --> 00:48:33.250
And then perhaps for a very
special form of that

00:48:33.250 --> 00:48:36.220
generalized force, that tensor,
look at how the

00:48:36.220 --> 00:48:37.870
polarization changes.

00:48:37.870 --> 00:48:40.610
But you're going to have to
look at six different

00:48:40.610 --> 00:48:42.760
representation surfaces--

00:48:42.760 --> 00:48:45.440
each one which will describe
a different

00:48:45.440 --> 00:48:47.530
piezoelectric effect.

00:48:47.530 --> 00:48:51.530
So this will become less simple
in many respects.

00:48:51.530 --> 00:48:55.370
But correspondingly, more
interesting because we'll have

00:48:55.370 --> 00:49:01.360
some really wild, mind boggling
representation

00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:05.740
surfaces for piezoelectric
effects.

00:49:05.740 --> 00:49:12.120
OK so we'll stop there and
resume on Thursday.

00:49:12.120 --> 00:49:15.350
And I'll let you get back to
the MRS if that's where you

00:49:15.350 --> 00:49:16.600
earlier today.

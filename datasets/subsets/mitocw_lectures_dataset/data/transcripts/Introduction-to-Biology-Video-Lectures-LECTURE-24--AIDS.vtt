WEBVTT

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
It comes acquainted
with different antigens.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
And recall that
what we were talking

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
about was the following, that
there were several kinds of

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
phagocytic cells. Phagocytic
cells are cells that

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
chew up other things, both
macrophages and even more

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
frequently, dendritic cells,
many of which hang around lymph

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
nodes by the way. They
process antigens into

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:41.000
oligopeptides. The
oligopeptides get presented on

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.000
the surface of these cells.
Let's say, here's a macrophage,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:56.000
in the form of through the class 2
MHC molecules which are displayed on

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.000
the surfaces of the cells. And,
here's a typical oligopeptide

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
that has been chewed up from one
of the antigens that was previously

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
internalized, eaten up by the
macrophage, a dendritic cell,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
and then presented on the surface.
Recall, then, we have an itinerant

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
macrophage or dendritic cell.
Could we turn up the sound just a

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
little, just a notch? Thank
you. And this dendritic cell

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
or macrophage, I'll just
call it a macrophage for

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
the moment, is then moving
largely through the lymph nodes,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
but wherever it moves, it's
carrying along this oligopeptide.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
And recall that we liken this voyage
of it to a Middle Eastern market

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
where there's a lot of bazaar
stalls on either side of the road,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
and where instead of the usual male
merchants, there's a lot of female

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
merchants hanging out. And
these females are called T

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
helper cells. They're a
kind of T lymphocyte or T

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000
cell. TH refers to their function.
And here, all of these T helper

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000
cells, I'll indicate each of
them here as a pink circle.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
And these T helper cells display on
their surface to blow them up to a

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000
large size a T cell receptor
that is organized much the way

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000
immunoglobulin molecule and
antibody molecule's organized.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.000
That is to say, it has
variable and constant regions.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.000
It's generated through the
rearrangement of antibody-like genes.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000
But it only functions, this
T cell receptor or as it's

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000
called in the trade the TCR, only
functions to sense the presence

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000
of antigens in the
extracellular space. In fact,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000
it senses antigens in the
context of the MHC class 2.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
So here's an MHC class 2 molecule.
We can think of the MHC class 2 as

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.000
being a hand, which is
presenting this oligopeptide.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000
I haven't drawn a hand, but
you can pretend it's a hand.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000
And this MHC class 2 is being
presented by either a macrophage or

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
a dendritic cell. And
recall, we talked about the

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000
voyage of this macrophage or
dendritic cell through this street

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000
here, and all these T helper cells
are kind of lazily waiting along on

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.000
the sidelines looking at what
this phagocytic cell is hocking.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Most of the T helper cells are
totally uninterested in what he's

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.000
hocking. But one of them is struck.
It's love at first sight, this one

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.000
over here, let's say,
because her T cell receptor

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000
precisely recognizes this
oligopeptide in the context of the

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000
MHC class 2 molecule. And,
obviously I would like to draw

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
thousands of these T helper
cells here, each of which bears a

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
different T cell receptor on her
surface. I'm only showing one.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
And recall that after
they make this encounter,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
the T helper cell gets all
excited because she says,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000
oh, I can't believe it, you
have exactly the oligopeptide

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000
that's recognized by my receptor.
And so, she gets all excited, and

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000
what she does is she proliferates
because that's about all that

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000
excited cells can do. Well,
they can do other things,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.000
but again, we don't want
to talk about it. Anyhow,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.000
so this particular T helper cell
undergoes a clonal expansion,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.000
and is now activated, i.e. activated
not only psychologically but

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.000
physiologically by having
encountered the antigen-presenting

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.000
cell. The MHC class 2,
the macrophage is called an

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.000
antigen-presenting cell. It's
using its MHC class 2 molecules

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.000
to do so. Macrophages and dendritic
cells are pretty much similar in

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:13.000
this respect. Macrophages go
all over the body in the tissues.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.000
Dendritic cells tend to inhabit the
lymph nodes. But from the point of

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.000
view of our discussion today,
we can imagine that they're

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.000
functionally essentially equivalent.
And having said that, now these T

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:34.000
helper cells go looking
for a congenial B cell.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.000
So, now we have a third actor in
the drama, and the congenial B cell

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.000
looks like this. And, the
B cell has the following

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.000
thing. The B cell has also on its
surface, MHC class 2 molecules,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:55.000
which can be used in antigen
presentation. But the B cell has an

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000
addition as we said last time,
already, on its surface, IGM

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.000
molecules. An IGM is
a brand of antibody.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.000
Keep in mind that really one of
the paradoxes that we haven't really

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000
fully settled on is the following
question or the following issue.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.000
How is it that when a B
cell sees a cognate antigen,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:24.000
why does it get stimulated?
In other words, what is it that

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.000
induces the B cell to
start proliferating?

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
Here's another version of
what I showed you last time,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000
where a B cell which makes the
right antibody gets stimulated,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000
but a B cell that doesn't
does not get stimulated.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000
And that's the issue we're
wrestling with right now.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000
So here on the surface of
this B cell is an IGM molecule.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000
Keep in mind an IGM molecule
is an antibody molecule.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000
Immunoglobulin means IG. It's
the earliest form of antibody

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000
that's made. Once again,
it is antigen specific.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.000
Its variable region has been
rearranged through the fusion of

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.000
different VDJ segments
and somatic hypermutation.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.000
And, this B cell has a
very interesting property.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.000
This is a naÃ¯ve cell, and
what this B cell does is as

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.000
follows. It moves around the body,
and if this B cell happens to find

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:30.000
an antigen, which is recognized
by its antibody, the IGM antibody.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:36.000
Then the B cell will bind this
antigen using its IGM molecule to do

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:42.000
so. More importantly, it
will then internalize this

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:48.000
antigen and chew it up into little
pieces, and then present it on it

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:54.000
surface via the MHC class 2
molecule. So, let's just review what

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.000
we've been saying. Before,
we were talking about

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.000
macrophages and dendritic cells,
which gobbled up whatever they could,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.000
processed whatever they gobbled up,
and put it on the surface again as

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000
MHC class 2, and therefore the
macrophages and the dendritic cells

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000
are really like sewer rates.
They'll just chew on anything and

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000
they'll put it on their surface.
They're totally promiscuous in what

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.000
they present on their surface.
But here, the B cell is doing

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.000
something rather similar. But
the B cell isn't presenting

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.000
whatever it happens to
stumble across on its surface.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.000
The B cell is extraordinarily
selective at what it presents on its

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.000
surface. It only presents on its
surface those antigens which are

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:44.000
recognized by its IGM molecule.
So here, it uses its IGM molecule

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000
to grab hold of this antigen.
It internalizes the antigen, and

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:53.000
then presents it back on the
surface as an MHC class 2 molecule.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000
So, there's a profound contrast in
the behavior of these two kinds of

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:02.000
antigen-presenting cells. The
macrophages and dendritic cells,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.000
they just gobble up everything,
and whatever they find,

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000
they put on their surface. They
don't care with MHC class 2.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000
The B cell is extraordinarily
selective and specific.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000
It will pull in not through regular
phagocytosis. It will pull in using

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000
its IGM receptor,
specific antigens that are

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000
recognized by its IGM molecule,
and then externalize it using its

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000
MHC class 2 molecule to do so.
Let's go back to the drama of the

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000
activated T helper cell, and
here's the activated T helper

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:39.000
cell. We'll draw her in pink.
The T helper cell has just had an

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000
encounter with a macrophage, or
dendritic cell. And, she's just

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:48.000
left this marketplace. And
now, she's very excited.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:53.000
So here is her T cell receptor.
And she's very excited. She's

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000
putting out all kinds of
growth factors and multiplying

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:02.000
all over the place. And she
starts looking again now for

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000
a B cell with which he can react.
Now, most of the B cells in the

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000
body will not have an
epitope that she recognizes.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.000
Most of the B cells in the body
will have picked up other kinds of

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.000
things that happen to recognize
by their T cell receptor,

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:24.000
and will present it on the surface.
A rare B cell will happen to

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000
internalize an antigen, and
put on the surface, which is the

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000
same antigen that was recognized
previously in the previous

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:37.000
encounter. And so, now
this T helper cell goes

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:42.000
around looking for an attractive
male. What's an attractive male for

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:47.000
her? An attractive male for her is
one whose MHC class 2 molecule is

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:52.000
recognized directly in the context,
and this oligopeptide is recognized

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:57.000
by her T cell receptor. And
so, she'll come over here and

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:02.000
she'll say excitedly to the B cell,
you can't believe what just happened.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
She will say, I was just there.
I just went through the market.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.000
I was sitting there in the
marketplace, and along came a

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.000
macrophage, and presented me with an
oligopeptide that exactly fit in my

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.000
T cell receptor. And
now, she says excitedly,

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000
here I find a B cell has exactly the
same oligopeptide presenting it to

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.000
me. Isn't that a coincidence?
And the B cell says, come on lady,

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:29.000
get to the point. And she says,
I just had an encounter with a

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.000
macrophage dendritic cell. I
recognized the same oligopeptide

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.000
in the macrophage dendritic
cell that you have.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:42.000
And, the B cell says, well,
I guess this must be some kind

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.000
of meaningful encounter, and
so these two cells get together.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:51.000
And what happens now is that
the T cell, having recognized the

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000
oligopeptide, presented on the
surface of the B cell now begins to

00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:00.000
send out signals to stimulate
the B cell to proliferate.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
And this B cell now begins to
proliferate. And this B cell now

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.000
begins to proliferate, as is
indicated on this overhead,

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.000
and eventually it starts making IGM
molecules. It makes more of them,

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.000
and then through the class switching
that we talked about last time,

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:19.000
it'll make eventually IGG secreted
antibody gamma globulin molecules.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000
So you see here the three essential
cell types that participate in this.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.000
And why is it so complicated?
Because it's extraordinarily

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000
important that the immune
system doesn't inadvertently make

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000
antibodies that are inappropriate to
express, because as we said before,

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.000
if a certain of those antibodies and
indeed possibly many of them could

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000
be autoreactive. And what
do I mean by autoreactive?

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:47.000
I mean reactive with self. They
could be antibodies that react with

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:52.000
one's own tissues. And in
so doing, they could create

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:57.000
series kinds of autoimmune diseases.
So, we have this sequence of

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:02.000
failsafe reactions. So,
when finally the decision for

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.000
the B cell to get activated depends
on a previous encounter with the

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:11.000
same oligopeptide by a
macrophage or dendritic cell,

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:15.000
the T helper cell acting as an
intermediary and now activating the

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:20.000
B cell, once the T cell tells the
B cell that the T cell has had a

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.000
previous encounter with
exactly the same oligopeptide,

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:29.000
on that occasion being presented
by a macrophage or dendritic cell.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
And that is actually the mechanism
by which we get this clonal

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.000
expansion of B cells in the immune
system, and ultimately how we get

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.000
the productive antibody molecules.
I mean, this is the image I showed

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.000
you earlier, but I never really
explained to you what the biology

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.000
behind that is. I just
said that antigen encounter

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000
on the part of the B cell causes
that B cell to enjoy clonal

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000
expansion. And now, we've
gone through the detail of

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000
deciding how three different
cell types interact,

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.000
collaborate with one another to
create the antibody response because

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.000
this B cell then goes on to
produce IGM as it already is doing,

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.000
and then eventually IGG, and
possibly a series of other

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:17.000
immunoglobulins, IGE
and IGA which have other

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:21.000
purposes. Now, all of this
actually is an important

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:25.000
prelude to our main topic
of discussion today, which is

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:30.000
the disease of AIDS. And,
let me just add one other

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:35.000
detail to this because the ability
of a T helper cell to recognize MHC

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:39.000
class 2 molecules depends on another
cell surface molecule expressed by

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:44.000
the T helper cell. And
this other T cell surface

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:49.000
molecule is called CD4. CD4,
we don't have to worry of what

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:54.000
it stands for. CD4 is
not an antigen specific

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:59.000
receptor. CD4, instead,
only recognizes MHC class 2

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:04.000
molecules no matter
what they're carrying.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:09.000
So, there are MHC class 2 molecules
which I've implied to you can carry

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:14.000
thousands of different oligopeptides.
CD4 doesn't care what's being

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:20.000
carried by the MHC class 2.
It just binds to MHC class 2

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:25.000
molecules, thereby telling the T
helper cell that an encounter has

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:31.000
been made with an
antigen-presenting cell.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:36.000
So, the ligand for CD4 is part
of the MHC class 2 molecule.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:42.000
Now, that all leaves us in a very
nice segue to the whole disease of

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:47.000
AIDS. Let's just remember how the
disease of AIDS was discovered.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:53.000
In 1981, there were a group of five
young men who were all subsequently

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:58.000
determined to be gay, be
homosexual, who were discovered

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:04.000
in San Francisco to have a very
unusual kind of immunodeficiency.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:08.000
They all had night sweats.
They got different kinds of

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.000
otherwise unusual diseases. For
example one of the things they

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:17.000
got was a disease called Kaposi's
sarcoma, which was otherwise known

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.000
only in old southern Italian
and Jewish men, Kaposi's sarcoma.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:25.000
But these were young men, and
they were neither southern Italian

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:31.000
nor Jewish. They got
pneumocystis carinii,

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:37.000
which is a microbial
infection of the lung. And,

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:44.000
in fact, they got all kinds
of herpes virus infections.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:50.000
And they were all seen in a cluster
by an alert physician who saw

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:57.000
something very unusual,
and therefore said, perhaps

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:04.000
correctly, that they had
acquired immunodeficiency.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.000
Now, this acquired
immunodeficiency is a syndrome.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000
A syndrome, by the way, for
your information, is a whole

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000
collection of symptoms that appear
together. That's what a syndrome

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000
means. So, this term AIDS came
from the fact that they had a whole

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000
series of symptoms.
And, this was an acquired

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000
immunodeficiency rather than a
congenital immunodeficiency rather

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000
than a congenital immunodeficiency
because given the complexity of the

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000
immune system, you can
imagine correctly that there

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000
are a lot of people in the world
who were born with congenitally

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000
defective immune systems that are
immunodeficient from birth because

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000
there's so many different proteins
involved in regulating all of these

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000
different immune responses.
But this was really different.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000
It was an acquired immunodeficiency.
It was seen in a very special

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000
subgroup, and so the race was on
over the next two years to figure

00:17:31.000 --> 00:18:02.000
out what
was going on.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:06.000
Now, by coincidence,
starting in 1970-'71,

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:10.000
retrovirus research had begun.
And as it turned out, retrovirus

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:14.000
search, President Nixon's war on
cancer, retrovirus research was

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:18.000
motivated largely by the notion
that human cancers are caused by

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.000
retrovirus infections. And,
that led to the war on cancer.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.000
And the notion behind the war on
cancer was totally wrong because it

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:30.000
turns out that only a minute
fraction of human cancers have

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.000
anything to do with retrovirus
infections, although as we've said

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.000
earlier, retroviruses proved to be
very important tools experimentally

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:43.000
for discovering proto-oncogenes
and oncogenes in the genome.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:47.000
But if you ask, what
fraction of human cancers are

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.000
actually due to a human being
infected by a retrovirus?

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:55.000
It's almost zero. It's a
small fraction of a percent.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:59.000
Nonetheless, in the 1970s, there
was an enormous effort made in

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:03.000
trying to figure out all of
the biology of retroviruses.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:08.000
And by the late 1970s,
people concluded this was very

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:13.000
interesting science.
Indeed, proto-oncogenes and

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:18.000
oncogenes were discovered, but
that it was pretty irrelevant to

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:23.000
understanding directly how human
cancer arose, which human cancers

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:28.000
could be explained rather by
somatic mutations in the genome.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:33.000
In 1981, the AIDS infection arose.
And, what happened subsequently is

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:37.000
that there was a race on to try to
find out what the infectious agent

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:41.000
was because it seemed to
be an infectious agent.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:45.000
It was being spread from one gay
young man to another that was used

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:49.000
to induce this. And
within two years,

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:53.000
by 1983, the culprit retrovirus
had been found. I'm telling you this

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:57.000
long song and dance to give
you the following insight.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:00.000
If there had not been a decade
of earlier retrovirus research,

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.000
it could have taken the
scientific community many,

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.000
many years to figure out what
was causing AIDS. But through

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:11.000
happenstance, through a sheer
stroke of luck, by the time the first

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.000
individuals suffering from
AIDS were encountered in '81,

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.000
there was already a backlog
of a decade's worth of detailed

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:22.000
retrovirus research, which
made it possible to discover,

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:26.000
to discern almost within
months what was causing it.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:30.000
And, the agent that was
causing it was a retrovirus.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:33.000
The retrovirus here has indicated,
very schematically, these artists'

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:37.000
drawings never have any resemblance
of what things really look like.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:41.000
And if they do, it's only by
coincidence. Let me borrow your

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:45.000
laser pointer here for a second.
So here, and this is what a

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.000
retrovirus looks like
just to give you a feeling.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:52.000
In the center, there are
two single stranded RNA

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:56.000
molecules. The virus is diploid.
There's two copies of the genome

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:00.000
for reasons we still
don't understand.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.000
Surrounding it is a so-called
nucleocapsid, which is responsible

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:07.000
for protecting the RNA
molecules. These two pink dots are

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.000
reverse-transcriptase molecules
because as you'll recall,

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:14.000
when retroviruses infect a cell,
they carry the enzyme with them into

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:18.000
the cell. You could say, why
don't they make it after they

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:21.000
get into the cell? And it's
not totally obvious why,

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:25.000
but this is what they do. There's
another shell of proteins out here.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:29.000
And then, beyond that is a lipid
bilayer. And this lipid bilayer is,

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:33.000
as you may recall, stolen
from cell from which the

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:37.000
virus is protruding because if you
look at retrovirus-infected cells,

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:41.000
here's the plasma membrane
of a retrovirus-infected cell.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:45.000
Here you can see a nucleo-capsid
forming with the RNA molecules.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:49.000
And this shoves its way, protrudes
its way through the plasma membrane,

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:53.000
stealing a patch of plasma
membrane from the infected cell,

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:57.000
and at the same time this part of
the plasma membrane carries with it

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:02.000
viral glycoproteins.
And viral glycoproteins,

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:06.000
they're obviously glycosylated,
as are many other extracellular

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:10.000
proteins. And in this case,
they're indicated with these yellow

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:14.000
ovals, and these viral glycoproteins
are used to attach to subsequently

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:18.000
infected cells so what happens is
that when the retrovirus gets out of

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.000
the cell, I'll draw it
again schematically here,

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:26.000
it has this glycoproteins coat
on it with the plasma membrane,

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:30.000
and it uses these
glycoproteins spikes.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:34.000
I just won't put the yellow ovals on
them, to attach to cells which need

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:39.000
to be infected. So, here's
a target cell that needs

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:44.000
to be infected.
So, the target cell,

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:49.000
and how does this virus know how to
attach to this cell and not to other

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:54.000
cells? Because on the surface of
the target cell are certain cellular

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:58.000
proteins, which are used
for normal cell physiology,

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:03.000
which are there, and which the
virus has opportunistically developed

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:08.000
an affinity for. So here
on the surface of a target

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:13.000
cell might be a normal cellular
protein to which the viral

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:18.000
glycoprotein combined. Or,
if you want to get technical,

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:23.000
this enables the virus particle
to adsorb, to attach to.

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:28.000
Notice the D here rather than the
B, to adsorb to the surface of the

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:33.000
target cell. Importantly, what's
the cell surface protein of

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:38.000
the target cell to which HIV virus
adsorbs? It's our old friend CD4.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:42.000
I.e. the HIV particle likes to
adsorb, preferentially adsorbs to

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:47.000
the surface of cells that express
the CD4 molecule on the surface.

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:52.000
Note, by the way, that just five
minutes ago, we described a totally

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:57.000
different function of CD4. CD4
over here was said to represent

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:01.000
the means by which the T helper cell
can recognize MHC molecules being

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:06.000
displayed on the surface
of either of these dendritic

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:11.000
cells or B cells. But here
we see CD4 in a totally

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:16.000
different context. Here,
the CD4 represents the

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:22.000
docking site to which the
viral glycoprotein can attach,

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:27.000
enabling the virus, which came to
be called human immunodeficiency

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:32.000
virus. In fact, the
virus was discovered by

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:36.000
two groups simultaneously, one
of them called HDLV-3, the other

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:41.000
called lymphadenopathy virus.
The first group was American.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:45.000
The second group was French,
and they allowed Herald Varmus,

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:50.000
one of the co-discoverers of the
proto-oncogene to act as sort of the

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:54.000
judge to see what it would be called
because there was great political

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:59.000
tension. Would it get the American
or the French name depending on

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:03.000
which of the two warring scientists,
and they were warring, could claim

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:08.000
discovery? So, he had
a Solomonic decision.

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:12.000
He decided to name it human
immunodeficiency virus.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:16.000
That was a compromise. And by
the way, some people in less than

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:21.000
charitable mood say, well,
of course he named it human

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:25.000
immunodeficiency virus because
those are almost his own initials.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:30.000
But, I think that's unfair.
These were his initials.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:34.000
Here's human immunodeficiency virus.
He named it for a perfectly good

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:38.000
reason. Anyhow, that
broke the Franco-American

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:42.000
diplomatic tension, and now
one began to realize that

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:46.000
HIV or human immunodeficiency
virus attacked T helper cells and

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:50.000
preferentially infected T helper
cells by virtue of the ability of

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:54.000
the virus particle to dock itself
to the CD4 molecules presented on the

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:58.000
surface of these cells. By the
way, what happens afterwards,

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:02.000
after the virus becomes adsorbed
to the surface of an infectable cell

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:07.000
such as a T helper cell. So,
here's the virus particle.

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:13.000
Here's the surface of a T helper
cell. What happens then is these

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:19.000
two lipid bilayers fuse with one
another so that now they became one,

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:25.000
and now the internal contents, the
nucleocapsid which contains the RNA

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:31.000
and the reverse transcriptase now
has direct topological access into

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:36.000
the cytoplasm of the cell.
In fact, the glycoprotein,

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:40.000
the yellow ovals there of human
immunodeficiency virus actually had

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:44.000
two functions. First, it
specifically recognizes

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:48.000
the CD4 molecules to which it
then anchors or adsorbs the virus

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:52.000
particle. And secondly, it
also has fusing functions,

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:56.000
i.e. it's capable of causing
the lipid bilayer of the virion,

00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:00.000
or the virus particle, to fuse with
that of the plasma membrane of the

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:05.000
infected target cell.
And, once it's in there,

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:10.000
then the virus can begin
to do its replication. Now,

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:15.000
the replication of the HIV virus
was already pretty well understood by

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:20.000
the time that HIV was discovered in
1982-'83 because of this backlog of

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:25.000
retrovirus research. And
just to review for you how

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:30.000
retroviruses replicate,
RNA is put into the cell,

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:35.000
single stranded RNA. It's
called plus strand RNA because

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:40.000
it is of the same polarity of the
same strandedness as messenger RNA.

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:45.000
If it were complementary
to messenger RNA,

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:51.000
then it would be called minus strand
RNA. This is reverse transcribed by

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:56.000
the reverse transcriptase,
which is carried into the cell.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:01.000
RT stands for reverse transcriptase.
And now, one gets a double stranded

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:06.000
DNA molecule, a copy of the virus.
And this DNA copy is sometimes

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:11.000
called a provirus.
And just to review,

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:15.000
this provirus is then subsequently
integrated into the chromosomal DNA

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:20.000
of the cell. So,
here's the provirus.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:25.000
Here's the chromosomal DNA. And
then, this integrated provirus

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:30.000
then serves as a template for
making progeny plus-stranded RNA.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:34.000
And this progeny plus-stranded
RNA, which is, by the way, forward

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:39.000
transcribed by RNA polymerase too,
which does the bulk of the heavy

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:43.000
lifting in terms of making RNA in
the nucleus, this plus-stranded RNA

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:48.000
can have two functions recall.
One, it can serve as a template on

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:53.000
ribosomes for making viral proteins
such as the viral capsid proteins.

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:57.000
And two, the plus stranded RNA
can in turn be encapsidated,

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:02.000
i.e. it can become
packaged. Encapsidate equals,

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:06.000
it can become packaged by the
viral proteins to make progeny virus

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:10.000
particles, which can then bud,
as I've indicated here, from the

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:14.000
surface of the infected cell.
And in fact, we can imagine three

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:18.000
classes of viral proteins that
are required for replication.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:23.000
First is the reverse transcriptase,
which is encoded by the viral RNA.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:27.000
Second are the capsid
proteins which carry the RNA,

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:31.000
and third are the viral
glycoproteins up here which these

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:35.000
glycoprotein spikes which are
trans-membrane proteins that

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:39.000
protrude from the virion, and
allow the virion to adsorb to

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:44.000
the surface of infected cells.
It turns out that this virus has

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:49.000
become an extremely difficult virus
to deal with. For most viruses that

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:54.000
we have encountered over the last
100 years, one has had great success

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:59.000
in making vaccines against
these viruses including,

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:04.000
as we discussed in
great detail, poliovirus.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:09.000
In fact, for smallpox, another
virus, the vaccine effort

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:14.000
was so successful that about 20
years ago, the last case of smallpox

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:19.000
finally occurred in Eritrea in
northeast African when some herdsmen

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:24.000
had the last documented case.
And since that time, there have

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:29.000
been no documented cases of smallpox
in the wild, and there's only two or

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:34.000
three stocks of
smallpox virus surviving.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:37.000
One of them is in some type
of research center is Moscow,

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:41.000
and the other is probably in the
Communicable Disease Center in

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:44.000
Atlanta, Georgia. And,
there's been great debate,

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:48.000
by the way. Should one get
rid of those surviving stalks,

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:51.000
or should one keep them for research?
By now, you guys aren't vaccinated

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:55.000
against smallpox because nobody gets
it anymore, and there's a certain

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:59.000
risk of getting a
small pox vaccine.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:02.000
I am, so I'm not worried, but
maybe you should be because

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:06.000
starting about 20-25 years ago,
one stopped vaccinating people

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:10.000
against smallpox because it just
doesn't seem to be necessary.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:14.000
Why give them the risk of having
some disease which happens in one

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:18.000
out of a million vaccinees (sic)
instead of just leaving them

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:22.000
unvaccinated? Well, I
digress. Back to HIV,

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:26.000
the fact is we've had enormous lack
of success in making a good kind of

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:30.000
vaccine against
HIV, and why is that?

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:34.000
Well, one of the critical things
is that HIV is attacking and

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:38.000
replicating in the T helper cells,
and the T helper cells it turns out

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:42.000
are the lynch pains of the immune
response. Keep in mind that the T

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:46.000
helper cells that I've shown you
in this diagram over here represent

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:50.000
these critical cellular messengers
between the dendritic cells and the

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:54.000
macrophages on the one hand,
and the B cells on the other.

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:58.000
You wipe them out, and the
ability to make new antibodies is

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:03.000
totally compromised. It turns
out the T helper cells can

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:09.000
also help to make another class of
cells which are called cytotoxic T

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:16.000
cells, another kind of T cell,
cytotoxic, and these cytotoxic T

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:23.000
cells have on their surfaces T cell
receptors, which they can use to

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:30.000
recognize infected cells,
and kill infected cells.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:34.000
So, the cytotoxic T cells aren't
involved in making antibody

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:38.000
responses at all. The
cytotoxic T cells are involved

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:42.000
in recognizing cells that are
expressing unusual or foreign

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:46.000
antigens on their surface, and
killing those cells. That's the

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:50.000
function of the cytotoxic T cells.
Obviously, it's quite different

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:54.000
from the helper T cells. But
once again, the activation of

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:58.000
the cytotoxic T cells, and
empowering them to make these

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:02.000
attacks on abnormal cells
depends on the helper T cells.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:06.000
Once again, the helper T
cells represent the lynch pins,

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:10.000
the keystones, of the
immune response. But,

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:14.000
because of this tropism, and
when I use the word tropism,

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:19.000
I mean because of the desire of the
virus to phase towards and infect a

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:23.000
certain subset of cells in the body,
this tropism of HIV for infecting

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:27.000
and killing helper T cells,
the production of antibodies is

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:31.000
strongly compromised on the one hand,
and the production of cytotoxic T

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:36.000
cells is compromised
on the other.

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:40.000
There's another aspect of HIV
infection which is also very

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:45.000
insidious, and that's the following.
It turns out that the body can

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:50.000
initially make an immune response
against an infecting HIV particle.

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:55.000
And here's kind of what things look
like. I hope this shows up here.

00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:00.000
Who could lend me a
laser pointer again?

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:05.000
Excellent, thank you. OK,
so here's what happens.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:10.000
And, there's two graphs here.
On one hand are the cytotoxic T

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:16.000
cells, and their level is
shown on the solid line here.

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:21.000
So, look at the course of infection.
It's plotted here in weeks and

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:26.000
years. If you see what happens
in a primary HIV infection,

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:32.000
and here on the right on this
ordinate here is the viral titer

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:37.000
indicated on a log scale. So,
this is a semi-log graph for the

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:41.000
viral titer. And what you see over
here is that when you initially

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:45.000
infected it, there's an
enormous burst of viral titer.

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:49.000
It goes up by four or five orders
of magnitude, and then it falls down

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:53.000
dramatically by two or three
orders of magnitude. And it goes on,

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:57.000
and it remains depressed by two or
three orders of magnitude below its

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:02.000
initial height for
a number of years.

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:06.000
What's going on then? The
immune system has come to grips

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:10.000
with the presence of the HIV virus,
and begins successfully to try to

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:14.000
eliminate it. How does the
immune system eliminate HIV?

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:18.000
By two mechanisms. First of all,
the immune system makes neutralizing

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:22.000
antibodies of the sort that
float through the serum,

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:26.000
and are able to glom onto the
virus particle, attach to the virus

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:30.000
particle, and thereby prevent
it from being infectious.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:34.000
And secondly, as I mentioned last
time, the immune system also can

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:38.000
recognize virus-infected cells
and kill them. And by killing a

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:42.000
virus-infected cell, the
immune system prevents that cell

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:46.000
from continuing to function as a
factory for putting out new virus

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:50.000
particles. So, there's
two ways by which virus

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:54.000
particles are eliminated,
but note here that the virus

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:58.000
infected cell which is critically
important among all the cell types

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:02.000
in the body are
the T helper cells.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:06.000
So, certain components of the immune
system are killing the T helper

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:10.000
cells that are involved in
harboring and producing HIV virus.

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:14.000
So, there's an auto destruction
on the part of the immune system.

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:19.000
Look, at the same time, at the
titer, at the number of CD4 cells,

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:23.000
and they're indicated
here on the left ordinate,

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:27.000
in this case, cells per microliter.
CD4 cells originally started up

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:32.000
here. They go down
by a factor of two or

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:36.000
three for the first weeks,
and then over a period of years

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:40.000
there's this ongoing struggle
between the HIV particle and the

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:44.000
immune system as the number of CD4
cells, and the CD4 cells we've said

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:48.000
before, the CD4 positive cells are
these T helper cells as the number

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:52.000
of these cells per microliter of
blood progressively declines further

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:56.000
and further and further. And
finally, the number of CD4

00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:00.000
positive cells,
i.e. T helper cells,

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:04.000
gets so low that the body is totally
overwhelmed, and the patient then

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:08.000
dies of an
opportunistic infection.

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:12.000
What do I mean by an
opportunistic infection? Well,

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:16.000
what I mean is that we are
surrounded all the time by all kinds

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:21.000
of microbes, which given the chance
will kill us within a couple days.

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:25.000
Keep in mind, I told you
that there are in your gut,

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:30.000
as many bacterial cells as
there are the rest of your body.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:33.000
And some of these bacteria
are really nasty. I remember,

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:36.000
my grandfather got kicked
in the belly by a horse,

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:40.000
and three days later he was dead.
Why? Because some of the bacteria

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:43.000
got out of his gut, got into
his peritoneal fluid cavity,

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:47.000
and gone. This was
the pre-antibiotic era,

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:50.000
by the way, never new him very
well because he died in 1916.

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:54.000
I'm just telling you that your gut
is full of all kinds of nasty thing

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:57.000
on your skin. Not just on my skin,
but on your skin there are billions

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:01.000
of staph aureus bacteria.
They're just waiting to cause you

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:05.000
problems. Don't
look. It's OK.

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:09.000
Don't look too closely.
They're just waiting to cause a

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:13.000
nasty infection as well. Everyday
we breathe in all kinds of

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:17.000
awful microbes, fungi, and
all these kinds of things

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:21.000
including pneumocystis. And,
rarely do we get sick because

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:25.000
of the extraordinary competence of
the immune system to respond to such

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:30.000
a diversity of infectious
agents, and to hold them at bay.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:34.000
In the 20th century, the
percentage of people who die of

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:38.000
infectious diseases has plummeted
both because of the immune system

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:42.000
and because we're eating
healthier up to a point,

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:46.000
and because of antibiotics and
antifungals. But if the immune

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:50.000
system is defective, all
the antibiotics in the world,

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:54.000
and all the antifungal agents can't
save a patient if their CD4 cells

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:58.000
get down very, very low
because these antifungals

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:03.000
always worked as collaborators
with the immune system.

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:07.000
They get rid of a bulk of the
infection, but the immune system has

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:11.000
to wipe out the residue. And
what you see here is a struggle

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:15.000
going on for a period of three,
four, five, six years where the

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:19.000
viral titer is successfully held
low, and then all of a sudden as the

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:23.000
immune system weakens the viral
titer goes up to high levels,

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:27.000
wipes out the residual T helper
cells, and death invariably

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:31.000
ensues. Now, I've
given you one reason why

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:34.000
the immune system can't deal with
this virus, because virtually all

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:38.000
other viruses attack various
tissues throughout our body,

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:41.000
but they don't attack
the immune system itself.

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:44.000
Here, we're having a virus which is
attacking the defense of the body,

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:48.000
that is to say, the immune system.
So, one reason is the continuing

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:51.000
depletion of the T helper cells.
They can regenerate themselves for

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:54.000
a period of time, very
impressively long period of

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:58.000
time, four, five, six,
seven years. But ultimately,

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:02.000
they get worn out, they die.
Another reason is this is antigenic

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:08.000
variation. Now, if you
look at the retrovirus

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:14.000
particle, what you see is on
the surface the glycoprotein.

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:19.000
It's right here. And, the
glycoprotein is used by antibodies

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:25.000
to recognize and bind to the
virus particle and neutralize it,

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:30.000
same as with poliovirus.
But let's imagine,

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:34.000
as happens to be the case, that
the virus is highly error prone

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:39.000
in replicating its genome. When
I say error prone, I mean that

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:44.000
instead of the host cell,
polymerase, which makes ultimately

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:48.000
one mistake out of a billion,
the viral replication machinery

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:53.000
makes mistakes all the time.
It's quite defective in the

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:58.000
fidelity and the faithfulness with
which it replicates nucleic acid.

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:02.000
That means that after each cycle
of replication, there are in effect

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:07.000
mutant viruses that have been
produced, mutant progeny viruses,

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:11.000
and where the mutation rate instead
of being one in 10-9 might be one in

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:16.000
10-2 or one in 10-3. And
that means that there are

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:20.000
continually novel variants of HIV
being produced in a person's body.

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:25.000
Let's imagine that that person has
developed antibodies against the

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:30.000
viral glycoprotein of the virus
that initially infected him or her.

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:34.000
Let's imagine that. And those
antibodies are successful

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:38.000
in eliminating most of the virus
particles of the sort that initially

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:42.000
infected that individual.
But now we can imagine the

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:46.000
possibility that in the
imperative weeks or months,

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:50.000
a new strain of HIV will arise
within that individual's body a

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:54.000
mutant strain in which the sequences
that code the viral glycoprotein had

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:58.000
been changed slightly. And
now, the viral glycoprotein has

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:02.000
changed slightly its epitopes.
And the initially developed

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:07.000
neutralizing antibody that
recognized the initial cohort of

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:12.000
virus coming into the cell in the
individual no longer works because

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:17.000
the virus has undertaken a
strategy of immune evasion,

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:22.000
sometimes it's called immunoevasion,
in which now the viral glycoprotein,

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:27.000
although it's still competent to
affect a replication cycle to adsorb

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:32.000
and fuse to the surface
of an affected cell.

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:36.000
Many of the epitopes, many of
the oligopeptide antigens on

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:40.000
the surface of the glycoprotein have
been changed slightly through amino

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:44.000
acid substitutions,
through point mutations.

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:48.000
And hence, the initially developed
antibody, which previously was

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:52.000
successful in glomming on and
neutralizing this virus particle is

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:56.000
rendered ineffective.
And now, this second wave,

00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:00.000
this new strain of HIV will grow
up and expand in that individual,

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:04.000
and once again provoke
a new immune response.

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:07.000
And, the same cycle will repeat it.
The second strain will now soon be

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:11.000
eliminated, but while the
elimination is going on,

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:15.000
there's strong Darwinian selective
pressure favoring the outgrowth of

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:19.000
yet another mutant strain which is
not recognized by either of the two

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:23.000
initial antibody responses.
And so, over this period of many

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:27.000
years, what's happening is that
the virus in the immune system are

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:31.000
playing continual cat and
mouse games with one another.

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:34.000
The immune system goes after the
virus; the virus moves over here;

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:38.000
the immune system goes after that;
and so you have a succession of

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:42.000
antigenic variance.
Here's one variant.

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:45.000
Here's another variant.
Here's another variant, and so

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:49.000
forth. By the time the immune
system succeeds in getting rid of

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:53.000
the first variant, a
new variant has appeared,

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:57.000
and then the immune system ramps up
its defenses and tries to get rid of

00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:00.000
that. And, it succeeds almost.
But by the time that has happened,

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:04.000
yet a third variant has appeared.
And so, there are these continual

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:08.000
clonal successions. A clonal
succession represents a

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:11.000
time where one clonal virus explodes,
expands. It's soon eliminated,

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:15.000
collapses, and then another
clone comes up and expands.

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:19.000
And this goes on. This
works OK for about four,

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:22.000
five, six years. But
ultimately, the ability of the

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:26.000
T helper cells to replenish
themselves and to continue to mount

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:30.000
an effective immune
response fails.

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:34.000
There's yet another aspect of HIV
infection which is so insidious,

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:38.000
and that's the following. Let's
look at the viral life cycle right

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:42.000
here, and the provirus, remember
the provirus is this thing

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:46.000
right here, which is integrated
into the chromosomal DNA.

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:50.000
And, we can assume that this
provirus is transcribed by RNA

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:54.000
polymerase too, and I
will tell you that the

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:58.000
promoter of the provirus is
carried in by the proviral DNA,

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:02.000
and actually depends on
transcription factors that are

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:07.000
present in the T helper cell.
In fact, you'll recall that the T

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:11.000
helper cell gets excited sometimes,
and other times it's not excited.

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:15.000
And she gets excited if I can
attach gender to a T helper cell,

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:20.000
when she encounters
macrophages and dendritic cells,

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:24.000
and/or when she encounters B cells.
Other times, the T helper cell is

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:28.000
kind of quiet and unactivated (sic).
And, what happens when a T helper

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:33.000
cell gets activated
through these encounters?

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:37.000
The T helper cell starts making
her own transcription factors,

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:41.000
which are used in order to
facilitate these complex biological

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:45.000
interactions with both
antigen-presenting cells,

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:49.000
macrophages and dendritic cells,
and later on, B cells. And those

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:53.000
same transcription factors that the
T helper cell uses to turn on its

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:57.000
own expression program are used
by the provirus to transcribe

00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:01.000
its own DNA, i.e. HIV
has evolved a proviral

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:05.000
promoter sequence here which takes
advantage of transcription factors

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:09.000
that are present uniquely
in an activated T cell.

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:13.000
And when those transcription
factors are available,

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:17.000
not only does the T cell become
activated, but the provirus becomes

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:21.000
transcribed because these
transcription factors now enable RNA

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:25.000
polymerase 2 of the host
to transcribe the provirus.

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:29.000
But let's imagine now, if we follow
that scenario to its conclusion,

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:33.000
what happens when the
T cell is not activated?

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:37.000
When the T cell is quiescent, when
it's quiet, these transcription

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:41.000
factors are unavailable to attach
to the promoter of the integrated

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:45.000
provirus, and as a consequence the
provirus will not be transcribed.

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:49.000
It won't make RNA, and in that
situation, how will anybody know

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:53.000
that there's an integrated
provirus in there? Well,

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:57.000
the provirus is not being
transcribed. The transcripts aren't

00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:02.000
being used to make viral protein.
So in effect, the only evidence for

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:06.000
the existence of HIV in the
cell is this segment of DNA.

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:10.000
In other words, this provirus can
hide out in an unactivated quiescent

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:14.000
T cell indefinitely. And,
the immune system can't know

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:18.000
that there's a provirus hiding out
in this T helper cell because it's

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:22.000
not being transcribed. And
therefore, one can have a

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:26.000
quiescent T helper cell, and
several other cell types in the

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:30.000
body, macrophages also, which
aren't transcribing their

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:34.000
proviruses.
Well, you'll say,

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:38.000
so what? It doesn't make any
difference. If it's not being

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:42.000
transcribed, it's not going
to hurt the individual.

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:46.000
But, keep in mind that the idea of
getting rid of a viral infection is

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:49.000
to eliminate all traces of a viral
genome from an infected individual,

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:53.000
and that's what happens with
smallpox and with poliovirus,

00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:57.000
and with measles and virtually
all the other infections we have.

00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:01.000
But here, we have a situation where
the viral genome can hide out in a

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:05.000
latent or inapparent
(sic) configuration.

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:09.000
There's no way to know it's there,
and it may reemerge days, weeks,

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:13.000
months, even years later because
this previously transcriptionally

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:17.000
silent provirus may suddenly be
present in a cell which suddenly

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:22.000
becomes activated. And
now, an individual who

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:26.000
"thought" quote unquote that he or
she had gotten rid of HIV infection

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:30.000
all of a sudden realizes there
are viral genomes still hiding

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:34.000
out in the body. And
what that means is that in

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:38.000
effect, it's absolutely impossible
to rid the body of HIV infection

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:42.000
ever. Once an individual
is infected, in fact,

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:46.000
that individual is infected for
life. There's no way on Earth what we

00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:50.000
have at present of getting rid
of the viral infection because the

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:54.000
viral genome is always hiding
out here or there in different

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:58.000
interstices of the immune system,
hiding out in transcriptionally

00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:02.000
silent state. Of course,
we have very effective

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:06.000
drugs against HIV now. Some
drugs inhibit the reverse

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:10.000
transcriptase. Others
inhibit the processing of

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:14.000
the capsid proteins, that
is, the proteins which these

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:19.000
capsid proteins happen to be cleaved
from a large, high molecular-weight

00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:23.000
protein precursor into individual
proteins, and there's an inhibitor

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:27.000
of the protease that cleaves
these proteins to the mature size.

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:31.000
And, those drugs together hold the
viral infection at bay for maybe 10,

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:36.000
15, 20 years. But keep
in mind that even though

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:40.000
the viral infection is
being stopped by these drugs,

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:45.000
first of all, the virus is always
hiding out in the bodies of such

00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:49.000
individuals in this latent, hidden
form, and secondly, there may

00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:54.000
be a slow depletion of their
T helper cells in spite of the

00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:58.000
effectiveness of these drugs. On
that cheerful note, I wish you a

00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:03.000
good day.

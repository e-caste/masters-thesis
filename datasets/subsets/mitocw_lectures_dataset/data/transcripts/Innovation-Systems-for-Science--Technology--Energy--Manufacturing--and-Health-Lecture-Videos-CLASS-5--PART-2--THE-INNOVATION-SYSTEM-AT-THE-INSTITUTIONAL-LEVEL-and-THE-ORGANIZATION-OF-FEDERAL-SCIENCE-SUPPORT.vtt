00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:22.950
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: All right.

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:29.850
This is Vannevar Bush, and I had
you read The Endless Frontier,

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:33.690
which is maybe
the most important

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.990
organizational
document in US science.

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:39.580
Vannevar Bush--
fascinating figure.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.610
This is his--

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.710
He's considered one of the
first great computer scientists,

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:58.200
and he creates this
amazing device in a room

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.910
that essentially functions
as a computer that

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.970
can do, fascinatingly enough,
differential equations.

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.480
And it's room size,
and it consists

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.940
of these rods and brass knobs.

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.438
And you spend a day setting
up what you want to do,

00:01:16.438 --> 00:01:17.730
and then you adjust everything.

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:20.490
And then, you've got the answer.

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.290
It's not what I'd
call high speed,

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.660
but conceptually,
computer scientists

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:28.510
view this as right up there with
what Babbage thought of and so

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:29.010
forth.

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:31.650
It's an absolutely
foundational tool

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.950
in developing modern computing.

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.920
Vannevar Bush is a professor
of engineering at MIT.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.950
He understands industry.

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.980
He was a founder of Raytheon.

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.610
He obviously understood
vacuum tubes,

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.830
because Raytheon
was an early builder

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:55.100
of vacuum tubes for a lot
of radio communication.

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.190
But he decided he didn't
trust vacuum tubes.

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:00.230
They were too fallible.

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:05.300
So when he put his
differential analyzer together,

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.702
he uses these weird
rods and knobs.

00:02:07.702 --> 00:02:08.660
Here he is, by the way.

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.840
I think that's Frank
Compton with Vannevar Bush.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.620
In the course of war, World
War II, he becomes, in effect,

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.000
Mr. Science.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.580
Here he is at the ultimate point
of fame in that time period,

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.370
on the cover of Time magazine.

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.700
But he's viewed as the mobilizer
of the US science system.

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.560
And day after day,
year after year,

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.200
it's just a series of "wow"
moments for the American public

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.990
as these scientific
advances come onto play,

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:41.560
from radar to atomic power.

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.800
And it's a remarkable story.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.850
So he's quite close
to Franklin Roosevelt.

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:55.020
He sees the entire
system being dismantled

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.480
at the end of World War II.

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.870
So he persuades Roosevelt--

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.658
let's hang onto something.

00:03:02.658 --> 00:03:04.200
Everybody thinks
world peace is going

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.208
to break out and be
enduring, and that the US

00:03:08.208 --> 00:03:10.000
military machine is
going to be dismantled.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.630
Everybody's going to
come home from overseas,

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:17.460
and we'll go back to
essentially having no army.

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:19.650
That's what lies ahead,
and Vannevar Bush

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.810
realizes what amazing
stuff has been

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.380
accomplished in the scientific
world in the course of the war.

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.070
So he persuades
Franklin Roosevelt.

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.860
Let's hang on to some of it.

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:38.880
And Franklin Roosevelt writes
to Bush saying, essentially,

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:39.517
three things.

00:03:39.517 --> 00:03:41.100
How do we diffuse
scientific knowledge

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.225
that's gained from the war?

00:03:42.225 --> 00:03:45.600
How do we organize scientific
knowledge, particularly

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:46.740
a war against disease?

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:49.140
And what's the governmental
role in supporting science

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:50.842
and private sector research?

00:03:50.842 --> 00:03:52.050
Essentially, these questions.

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:54.660
Probably, Vannevar
Bush wrote the draft

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.180
for Franklin Roosevelt
to send back to him.

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.832
That's probably--
this is government.

00:04:00.832 --> 00:04:02.040
That's probably what happens.

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:08.340
He calls his work Science,
The Endless Frontier,

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.670
and he's appealing to a very
interesting historical strain

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:13.260
here.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.110
So one of the great
historians of the first half

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:18.839
of the 20th century was
named Vernon Parrington.

00:04:18.839 --> 00:04:21.510
And Parrington
writes about the end

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:25.920
of the frontier and its
effect on American history

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:27.510
and American
society and culture.

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:30.600
And his point is that
one of the things that's

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.830
very different about
America is that

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:41.220
the structured, class-ridden
society breaks down

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.530
in American history
at the frontier.

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:45.060
And of course,
the entire country

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:48.720
is a series of advancing
frontiers, historically.

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.420
And that that's the
change agent that

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:55.020
creates the kind of dynamism
in American society,

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:58.680
and that deep sense of
equality that's lurking there.

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:03.540
And when the frontier is
officially declared ended,

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:07.440
like in 1900, it's a big moment.

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.240
Because what's the
frontier dynamic

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.840
going to be that's going
to keep our society

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:15.840
driving towards new
things, if we don't

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.390
have the frontier anymore?

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:20.880
So what Bush is arguing,
in this very interesting

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:25.820
historical sense, is
science is the frontier.

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:28.430
And science, by the way,
is not going to end.

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:30.380
It's an endless frontier.

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:33.320
So it's a very
interesting appeal

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:35.210
to a kind of
American sensibility.

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:42.290
So his paper actually
comes out in July, 1945.

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:45.640
Franklin Roosevelt had
died the previous April.

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:48.520
So it's presented
to Harry Truman.

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:56.890
And Bush is thinking through the
post-war model for US science

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:58.432
and its--

00:05:58.432 --> 00:06:02.000
the association-less model
dominates World War II.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.520
It's public-private
collaboration, for sure,

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:08.550
as Max pointed out.

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:11.730
In this document, Bush
disaggregates science.

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:16.875
He separates it back out.

00:06:16.875 --> 00:06:18.000
And we'll talk in a minute.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.900
We'll talk a little
bit later about why

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:22.490
he went in that direction.

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:28.690
But he essentially argues,
OK, American taxpayers.

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:31.380
Invest in science,
and you're going

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:33.730
to get some really big things.

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:37.160
And he essentially
argues for four of these.

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:39.820
So as everything's being
dismantled after World War II,

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:45.580
he argues, let's keep
investment in basic research.

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:47.110
That's his case.

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:49.720
And if you invest, American
taxpayer, in basic research,

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:51.246
here's what you're going to get.

00:06:51.246 --> 00:06:57.190
One-- you're going to get
a war against disease.

00:06:57.190 --> 00:07:01.600
Roosevelt, Bush,
many others had seen

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:05.980
the power of the
development of antibiotics

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:10.150
in the course of World War
II, which really scale up.

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:12.850
World War II is the first
war where people actually

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:16.030
died in combat as
opposed to disease.

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:19.210
The death rate in the
armies of World War II

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:23.080
is far lower than in
all previous wars.

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:24.790
It's very dramatic,
and that war is

00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:30.130
being fought in some
very tricky regions that

00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:32.950
are quite disease-prone.

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:35.800
And the antibiotics
just dramatically

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:38.410
reduce the death
rate from disease.

00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:41.815
So they saw how a
governmental effort

00:07:41.815 --> 00:07:44.440
of supporting that science, and
then supporting the production,

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:48.460
and then distributing
it, could create a war--

00:07:51.107 --> 00:07:52.690
pneumonia had been
the biggest killer.

00:07:52.690 --> 00:07:54.160
It was number one, right?

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:56.610
And that dramatically goes
down after World War II.

00:07:56.610 --> 00:07:59.410
It has a huge effect.

00:07:59.410 --> 00:08:03.340
So they saw the possibility
of investing in science.

00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:05.680
You'll get a war on disease.

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:09.030
It's a pretty powerful argument.

00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:11.530
Now, the next argument, they
didn't have to sell to anybody,

00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:14.030
because everybody understood
it as a result of World War II.

00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:18.730
Invest in science, you
get national security.

00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:21.310
And the Cold War hadn't
started at this phase.

00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:23.530
It's got another four or
five years before people

00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:27.160
will realize it's on them.

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:32.740
But he makes this argument,
and it falls on receptive ears,

00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:34.990
because people understand
how powerful radar is.

00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:38.740
People understand how powerful
nuclear power is and so forth.

00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:43.360
The transformation of technology
was dramatic in the war.

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:47.230
The third argument
is an intriguing one.

00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:49.330
American taxpayer,
invest in science,

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:52.930
and you will get what Vannevar
Bush calls public welfare.

00:08:52.930 --> 00:08:55.360
What's he talking about?

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:57.340
The big anxiety at the
end of World War II

00:08:57.340 --> 00:08:59.350
is, we've got these 16
million people overseas.

00:08:59.350 --> 00:09:00.850
They're going to
come out of uniform

00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:02.892
and they're going to come
back the United States.

00:09:02.892 --> 00:09:04.960
And we're dismantling all
wartime spending, which

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:06.850
is most of government spending.

00:09:06.850 --> 00:09:08.860
And we're dismantling
the war machine.

00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:11.340
We're going to have
another Great Depression.

00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:13.470
That's what everybody thinks.

00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:15.120
And you can see why.

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:18.240
What are these 16 million
people going to do?

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:21.570
And we're dismantling
all these industries.

00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:29.140
So Bush is arguing, we're
going to get full employment.

00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:31.960
And he's going after
this big post-war anxiety

00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:36.760
about where these returning
vets are going to be employed.

00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:41.380
And so he argues that
essentially, science

00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:47.690
creates innovation,
and that the innovation

00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:48.990
is going to drive the economy.

00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:51.650
All these new technologies
are going to be at hand.

00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:57.890
Fascinatingly, we do
get a huge dividend

00:09:57.890 --> 00:10:00.440
from all the scientific and
technological advances that

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:03.140
occurred during the war,
and we create a whole series

00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:07.820
of new industries coming out of
the war, and it actually works.

00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:09.500
And just in case
there was any doubt

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:13.370
about what to do with
those 16 million veterans,

00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:15.180
we had to park them somewhere.

00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:19.400
So we create the GI bill, and
we send them to universities,

00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:20.900
and they get degrees.

00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:23.690
So they take, actually, pretty
interesting technical training

00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:26.960
they got in the military,
and then greatly enhance it.

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:30.920
So we've got a very strong
technical pool of talent

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:31.880
entering the economy.

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:34.040
And this huge burst--

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:35.840
it's pure Romer right?

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:37.820
And there we go.

00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:41.570
We get this incredible
post-war economic growth time

00:10:41.570 --> 00:10:45.380
period that really
lasts until about 1970.

00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:47.975
The fourth argument
is, nurture talent--

00:10:47.975 --> 00:10:49.490
a Romer-like argument.

00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:51.800
His point is that
there's going to be

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:55.100
a governmental role in
the other three items,

00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:57.320
but there's got to be a
governmental role in backing

00:10:57.320 --> 00:10:59.083
this talent base up.

00:10:59.083 --> 00:11:01.250
There's going to be a
governmental role in educating

00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:03.750
scientific talent at scale.

00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:09.790
So Bush has got what we
can call a "pipeline"

00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:12.640
theory of innovation.

00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:13.990
Here's a pipeline.

00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:15.760
We've talked about this before.

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:17.860
The government will
dump basic research

00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:19.390
in at the end of the pipeline.

00:11:19.390 --> 00:11:22.150
Mysterious things will
occur in the pipeline,

00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:24.040
and great
technologies, products,

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:26.350
and a fabulous economy
will emerge at the end.

00:11:26.350 --> 00:11:29.050
That's the vision, right?

00:11:29.050 --> 00:11:32.260
That's his conceptual framework.

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:34.900
That's what he's arguing for.

00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:39.310
This vision of the governmental
role in basic research

00:11:39.310 --> 00:11:42.960
dominates US scientific
thinking to this day.

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:45.060
This is where it came from.

00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:47.100
Why?

00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:48.925
What is he up to here?

00:11:48.925 --> 00:11:49.800
Why is he doing this?

00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:51.900
Because in the course
of World War II,

00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:55.230
he created this incredibly
connected scientific system

00:11:55.230 --> 00:11:59.850
with unbelievable results,
where industry and government

00:11:59.850 --> 00:12:02.910
and universities were deeply
connected with each other--

00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:04.740
a highly connected system.

00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:07.657
And at the end of the war,
he pulls that model apart

00:12:07.657 --> 00:12:09.240
and says, the
governmental role is not

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:10.615
going to be this
connected stuff.

00:12:10.615 --> 00:12:12.840
It's going to be basic research.

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:15.810
What's he thinking?

00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:17.700
Interestingly,
he's the person who

00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:20.430
created the two most fundamental
scientific organizational

00:12:20.430 --> 00:12:21.360
models in US history.

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:22.590
He does them both, right?

00:12:22.590 --> 00:12:25.920
They're contradictory,
but he does them both.

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:27.300
What's he thinking about?

00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:32.820
Well, to some extent, I think he
was influenced by his physicist

00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:34.530
friends.

00:12:34.530 --> 00:12:38.220
And physics comes
out of World War II--

00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:41.820
people like Oppenheimer and
the Los Alamos project--

00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:47.640
with this huge concern
about, what have we done?

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:51.000
We've been hell bent to
create atomic weapons,

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:52.980
and then we don't use
them against Germany,

00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:54.052
because the war is ended.

00:12:54.052 --> 00:12:55.510
But then we use
them against Japan.

00:12:55.510 --> 00:12:57.052
And did we really
think this through?

00:12:57.052 --> 00:12:57.970
And what does it mean?

00:12:57.970 --> 00:13:00.300
What does it mean
to have unleashed

00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:04.532
this unbelievable new
force into the world's

00:13:04.532 --> 00:13:05.490
political environments?

00:13:05.490 --> 00:13:07.320
Are they ready for it?

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:11.100
So people like Oppenheimer
go through a huge rethink.

00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:13.080
A lot of the physics
community does this.

00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:16.650
Have we been too closely tied to
a military industrial complex?

00:13:16.650 --> 00:13:19.410
As Eisenhower
would put it later.

00:13:19.410 --> 00:13:23.450
So Oppenheimer is a close
friend of Vannevar Bush.

00:13:23.450 --> 00:13:26.180
Bush testifies for him
when Oppenheimer's security

00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:29.970
clearance is pulled
later on in the Cold

00:13:29.970 --> 00:13:34.800
War, which was pretty nervy.

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:36.620
He's influenced to
some extent by that,

00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:38.450
but he's not naive
about politics.

00:13:38.450 --> 00:13:41.660
He understands the importance
of national security,

00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:43.700
and he's an advisor
to the Defense

00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:46.880
Department in the
immediate postwar period.

00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:53.260
I think part of it is
just practical reality.

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:55.000
The federal government
is radically

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.810
decreasing its budget.

00:13:57.810 --> 00:14:01.530
The cheapest stage is investing
in early stage research.

00:14:01.530 --> 00:14:04.770
That's much cheaper than
applied research or development.

00:14:04.770 --> 00:14:07.450
Let's hang onto that.

00:14:07.450 --> 00:14:10.090
And we created the
federally-funded research

00:14:10.090 --> 00:14:10.640
university.

00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:13.420
That's an amazing creation.

00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:16.510
Let's be satisfied with
having done that one,

00:14:16.510 --> 00:14:19.210
and keep that
option on the table.

00:14:19.210 --> 00:14:21.100
I think that's a fair
amount of his thinking.

00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:24.940
He's being really
quite practical.

00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:28.243
But he is trying to remove
science from the fray.

00:14:28.243 --> 00:14:30.160
He was very concerned
in the course of the war

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:33.280
by science becoming politicized.

00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:36.610
Decisions about where to
put defense laboratories

00:14:36.610 --> 00:14:39.160
were based on regional
and local politics

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:42.640
that Franklin Roosevelt
was a master of.

00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:45.370
Building consensus in
different political regions

00:14:45.370 --> 00:14:50.380
and putting big research
centers in places like Tennessee

00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:56.530
had logic, but also
political logic, as well.

00:14:56.530 --> 00:14:57.850
And Bush didn't want that.

00:14:57.850 --> 00:15:01.600
Bush wanted science
out of the politics.

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:06.980
He wanted to really separate
the political system.

00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:13.270
So this is his vision
for postwar science.

00:15:13.270 --> 00:15:17.350
And by and large,
it becomes the case.

00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:21.760
So let's-- let me do Blanpied's
piece just very quickly--

00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:24.820
just a couple of minutes.

00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:28.210
He writes the early
history of NSF.

00:15:28.210 --> 00:15:32.640
So Vannevar Bush's design
at the end of the war is--

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:36.910
essentially, during the war,
he had the NRDC and the OSRD,

00:15:36.910 --> 00:15:41.280
two organizing committees
for US science.

00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:44.730
And basically, that's
probably the only time

00:15:44.730 --> 00:15:48.330
that we had pretty centralized
science in the United States.

00:15:48.330 --> 00:15:49.920
But when Vannevar
Bush ends the war,

00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:52.170
he wants to do the same thing.

00:15:52.170 --> 00:15:53.910
He wants to create one tent.

00:15:53.910 --> 00:15:55.920
So he has this vision
of why to do science

00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:57.090
in The Endless Frontier.

00:15:57.090 --> 00:15:59.100
Then he has an
organizational model,

00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:01.110
and he wants to create
this National Science

00:16:01.110 --> 00:16:04.710
Foundation as the tent
for all of US science.

00:16:04.710 --> 00:16:06.870
It's all going to go in there.

00:16:06.870 --> 00:16:08.260
It's going to be flexible.

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:10.230
It's going to be
loosely organized.

00:16:10.230 --> 00:16:13.800
It's not going to be
terribly hierarchical.

00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:16.710
It'll be somewhat
like what he was

00:16:16.710 --> 00:16:19.110
doing in the course
of the war, but that's

00:16:19.110 --> 00:16:21.380
what it's going to be.

00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:24.950
And something happens.

00:16:24.950 --> 00:16:28.130
He writes up this legislation
to create this one

00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:32.480
tent for all of US science,
and what became known as NSF.

00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:34.580
And it runs into this guy.

00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:36.110
So that's Harry Truman.

00:16:36.110 --> 00:16:38.460
And you'll notice on
the corner of the desk--

00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:40.310
it's just a little
statement here

00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:45.930
that says, "The buck stops
here," in italics letters,

00:16:45.930 --> 00:16:46.430
right?

00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:48.860
It stops on Harry Truman's desk.

00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:50.660
So Vannevar Bush
wrote up and got

00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:56.360
Congress to pass his National
Science Foundation bill.

00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:59.360
And much to everybody's
total amazement,

00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:02.770
Harry Truman gets
it, and he reads it,

00:17:02.770 --> 00:17:06.940
and he realizes that the buck is
not stopping on Harry Truman's

00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:07.869
desk for science.

00:17:07.869 --> 00:17:09.790
It's stopping on Vannevar
Bush, and a bunch

00:17:09.790 --> 00:17:13.480
of scientific elite types
will control science,

00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:19.359
out of political control
of the president.

00:17:19.359 --> 00:17:25.599
Harry Truman, not unreasonably,
says it's unconstitutional.

00:17:25.599 --> 00:17:26.650
We can't.

00:17:26.650 --> 00:17:28.180
This is an executive
branch agency.

00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:31.660
The president ultimately
needs responsibility.

00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:33.160
I'm not going to
mess these guys up.

00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:37.570
I like science, but
it belongs to me.

00:17:37.570 --> 00:17:42.680
So he vetoes the National
Science Foundation Act.

00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:45.710
He's influenced by a very
interesting guy named

00:17:45.710 --> 00:17:48.500
John Steelman who's
from a smaller college,

00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:51.680
but he's effectively
a science advisor.

00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:55.600
So Vannevar Bush and
Harry Truman, they

00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:57.850
didn't get along very well.

00:17:57.850 --> 00:18:00.160
Harry Truman, high
school educated,

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:01.285
never got to go to college.

00:18:01.285 --> 00:18:03.040
He was too poor
to go to college.

00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:04.990
Very smart guy.

00:18:04.990 --> 00:18:06.880
He's an artillery
captain in World War I,

00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:08.890
and a very successful one.

00:18:08.890 --> 00:18:14.290
And artillery commanders in
World War I are the smartest.

00:18:14.290 --> 00:18:15.880
You've got to
understand ballistics

00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:18.140
and all kinds of
complicated mathematics,

00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:21.550
and Harry Truman is very smart.

00:18:21.550 --> 00:18:23.250
So not a dumb guy.

00:18:23.250 --> 00:18:26.725
A very talented guy, and became
a highly-respected-- criticized

00:18:26.725 --> 00:18:28.810
a lot, but became a
highly-respected president,

00:18:28.810 --> 00:18:30.580
particularly in retrospect.

00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:32.830
So there's no putting
this guy down,

00:18:32.830 --> 00:18:35.320
but he just didn't get along
with this kind of Boston

00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:40.010
Brahmin Vannevar Bush type.

00:18:40.010 --> 00:18:44.215
And not that Vannevar Bush
was part of Boston society.

00:18:44.215 --> 00:18:44.780
He wasn't.

00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:46.590
He was from a lower
middle class family,

00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:53.900
and his father was a minister,
but they didn't get along.

00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:59.290
Bush got along really well
with Franklin Roosevelt.

00:18:59.290 --> 00:19:00.808
Not nearly as well--

00:19:00.808 --> 00:19:02.350
really, not at all
with Harry Truman.

00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:03.495
So they're at loggerheads.

00:19:03.495 --> 00:19:04.870
Vannevar Bush is
getting Congress

00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:07.810
to pass this without, really,
Harry Truman being involved.

00:19:07.810 --> 00:19:10.210
Harry Truman's got his own
advisor, John Steelman.

00:19:10.210 --> 00:19:14.050
And they have a
very different idea

00:19:14.050 --> 00:19:16.250
of how science can be organized.

00:19:16.250 --> 00:19:18.970
There's going to be a
lot more applied work,

00:19:18.970 --> 00:19:22.050
and it's going to be much
more associationalist

00:19:22.050 --> 00:19:23.710
is their vision.

00:19:23.710 --> 00:19:28.930
So the NSF bill
gets vetoed, and NSF

00:19:28.930 --> 00:19:33.160
doesn't get authorized
for another five years.

00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:40.040
So meanwhile, time
doesn't stand still.

00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:45.790
This is why we have this very
decentralized science agency

00:19:45.790 --> 00:19:48.700
system in the United States,
because Harry Truman vetoed

00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:51.220
the National Science bill.

00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:54.670
All these other
agencies are popping up,

00:19:54.670 --> 00:19:56.440
because there's jobs
that have to be done.

00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:59.740
So the Office of Naval
Research gets created

00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:02.830
in the Defense Department.

00:20:02.830 --> 00:20:06.670
The great energy, nuclear
weapons laboratories,

00:20:06.670 --> 00:20:13.090
Los Alamos, and later, Sandia
and Livermore and so forth--

00:20:13.090 --> 00:20:16.250
they all get created because
the atomic mission is there,

00:20:16.250 --> 00:20:19.690
and that has to be dealt with,
and they need science for that.

00:20:19.690 --> 00:20:22.030
So what later becomes the
Department of Energy Lab

00:20:22.030 --> 00:20:24.240
system is being stood up.

00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:26.920
Scientific support at the
Atomic Energy Commission

00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:30.310
is being undertaken to
support nuclear research.

00:20:30.310 --> 00:20:32.020
The National
Institute of Health,

00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:36.490
which is a little public
health research agency

00:20:36.490 --> 00:20:38.380
benefits more than
wartime advances

00:20:38.380 --> 00:20:40.192
in science and medicine.

00:20:40.192 --> 00:20:42.400
That becomes the National
Institutes of Health that's

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:44.500
now the monster in the room.

00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:48.700
All these things are popping
up, and NSF misses the boat.

00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:51.340
It doesn't get authorized
for another five years.

00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:53.830
Doesn't really get
stood up until Sputnik.

00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:57.820
It's very modestly
funded, until Sputnik.

00:20:57.820 --> 00:21:02.140
So this is why Vannevar
Bush gets his--

00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:04.720
he's successful in
his basic mission--

00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:06.790
governmental support for
research universities

00:21:06.790 --> 00:21:07.840
and basic research.

00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:10.090
He wins that battle.

00:21:10.090 --> 00:21:13.160
He loses this battle.

00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:15.590
He doesn't get
science in one tent.

00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:19.080
And there's an
ongoing, deep debate.

00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:21.300
Was that good?

00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:26.350
Are we better off with a very
flexible, decentralized system

00:21:26.350 --> 00:21:29.680
of science agencies that are
organized around all kinds

00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:32.210
of different missions?

00:21:32.210 --> 00:21:37.090
I think my view is, a lot
of disagreement, that's

00:21:37.090 --> 00:21:38.540
probably good for us, right?

00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:43.180
It creates a lot of pathways
of opportunities for scientists

00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:45.460
to pursue.

00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:47.140
They're not under one tent.

00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:48.790
They've got a lot of
options about what

00:21:48.790 --> 00:21:52.750
they go with their research,
and a lot of different missions

00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:55.900
converge and come to
bear to support science.

00:21:55.900 --> 00:22:00.220
So overall, it's probably
a positive, I would argue.

00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:05.800
But the negative is that it is
impossible to organize science

00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:07.780
across these agencies.

00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:09.490
It is a nightmare.

00:22:09.490 --> 00:22:11.170
Getting these agencies
to cooperate--

00:22:11.170 --> 00:22:14.200
and again, behind them are nine
appropriations subcommittees--

00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:16.870
nine separate appropriations
subcommittees.

00:22:16.870 --> 00:22:18.520
You gotta bring those
folks along too.

00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:21.700
Good luck.

00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:27.190
So central
coordination of R&D is

00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:29.980
a huge organizational challenge.

00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:35.680
And look, it's not as if
one single agency owns NANO.

00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:37.412
You want to make
progress on NANO?

00:22:37.412 --> 00:22:39.370
You've got to bring all
this cast of characters

00:22:39.370 --> 00:22:42.010
together and get them to
hammer out cooperation,

00:22:42.010 --> 00:22:43.450
which is very hard to do.

00:22:43.450 --> 00:22:46.930
High performance computing
is a beneficial technology

00:22:46.930 --> 00:22:48.310
for all of these agencies.

00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:50.970
How do you get them
to cooperate on that?

00:22:50.970 --> 00:22:53.080
These are nightmare
organizational problems

00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:53.710
in our system.

00:22:53.710 --> 00:22:57.760
We finally created the Office
of Science and Technology Policy

00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:01.900
as the coordination
entity, but OSTP does not

00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:03.910
have budget authority.

00:23:03.910 --> 00:23:08.140
It doesn't really control the
budgets of these agencies.

00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:10.510
So it can't, in the end--

00:23:10.510 --> 00:23:12.310
federal government
money is power.

00:23:12.310 --> 00:23:15.040
It doesn't have any money.

00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:18.070
So it works with OMB
and moves things along,

00:23:18.070 --> 00:23:20.710
but we do not have
an efficient system

00:23:20.710 --> 00:23:22.840
for cross-agency
collaboration, which

00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:26.260
becomes very critical when
a scientific advance will

00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:29.360
affect a number of the actors.

00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:31.815
AUDIENCE: What year
was OSTP created?

00:23:31.815 --> 00:23:33.440
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
Well, Vannevar Bush

00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:36.230
is considered the first
scientific advisor.

00:23:36.230 --> 00:23:40.310
John Steelman is sort
of considered second.

00:23:40.310 --> 00:23:45.320
OSTP-- Eisenhower has
a science advisor,

00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:49.780
so Killian, MIT's president,
becomes his scientific advisor.

00:23:49.780 --> 00:23:51.530
Jerry Wiesner, also
MIT's president,

00:23:51.530 --> 00:23:53.900
becomes Jack Kennedy's
science advisor.

00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:54.980
Talk about talent.

00:23:54.980 --> 00:23:59.330
Those are amazing characters.

00:23:59.330 --> 00:24:02.310
So whether it's
called OSTP or not,

00:24:02.310 --> 00:24:04.040
there's a scientific
advisory system

00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:07.280
that really endures,
starting with Vannevar Bush,

00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:09.590
with the exception of
a brief period of time

00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:12.020
when Richard Nixon
got mad at scientists

00:24:12.020 --> 00:24:15.260
and he shuts down his
scientific advisory system.

00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:19.010
But that gets revived under
President Ford very quickly.

00:24:19.010 --> 00:24:20.960
So we've had a pretty
continuous system.

00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:24.650
President Trump has not named
a science advisor yet, however.

00:24:24.650 --> 00:24:26.435
So that chop is
kind of Home Alone.

00:24:26.435 --> 00:24:27.440
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:30.080
But from an organizational
point of view,

00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:32.180
with all these disparate
scientific agencies,

00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:35.690
you do need some coordination
entity, from just a practical

00:24:35.690 --> 00:24:37.770
governance perspective.

00:24:37.770 --> 00:24:42.980
So I think that will
happen over time.

00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:46.700
So I've forgotten what
year the OSTP Act--

00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:49.070
Authorization Act
actually passed.

00:24:49.070 --> 00:24:52.760
It's got to be in the
'80s, but we've effectively

00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:56.670
had a scientific advisory
system in place since, really,

00:24:56.670 --> 00:24:59.870
the outset of World War II.

00:24:59.870 --> 00:25:01.550
All right, I'm done.

00:25:01.550 --> 00:25:02.950
It's yours.

00:25:02.950 --> 00:25:04.345
And you've got-- and yours.

00:25:04.345 --> 00:25:04.970
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:25:04.970 --> 00:25:05.720
So how should we--

00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:06.380
I could--

00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:07.520
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: So
why don't you do Bush,

00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:09.245
and then we'll go to
Blanpied and we'll kind of--

00:25:09.245 --> 00:25:09.410
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:25:09.410 --> 00:25:10.920
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Because
they're these two models.

00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:12.770
One is basic research
support and the other

00:25:12.770 --> 00:25:14.425
is no single tent.

00:25:14.425 --> 00:25:15.050
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:25:15.050 --> 00:25:16.460
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: That's
the two issues here.

00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:17.480
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:22.820
So regarding that
single tent view,

00:25:22.820 --> 00:25:26.360
I've noticed that a lot
of scientific research

00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:29.210
has had problems securing
funding for long periods.

00:25:29.210 --> 00:25:31.220
Because often
scientific research,

00:25:31.220 --> 00:25:35.180
by nature, is long-term,
and doesn't always

00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:37.820
produce useful results.

00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:39.860
Actually, this is one of the--

00:25:39.860 --> 00:25:41.240
I think Adolph
Hitler, actually--

00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:45.740
he tried to ban all scientific
research outside of directly

00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:46.970
applied science.

00:25:46.970 --> 00:25:49.790
So he didn't want anything
in quantum or anything

00:25:49.790 --> 00:25:52.880
weird or theoretical like
that, where he could not see

00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:56.130
the obvious applications of it.

00:25:56.130 --> 00:25:59.090
So with that, I'm curious
what your thoughts

00:25:59.090 --> 00:26:03.590
on our governmental system, and
how incentives can be revised

00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:08.120
such that long-term
scientific strategic thinking

00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:09.650
can take place.

00:26:09.650 --> 00:26:12.760
Because as it is, people have--

00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:15.780
they are reelected every
two, four, or six years,

00:26:15.780 --> 00:26:16.790
so they have to--

00:26:16.790 --> 00:26:18.830
they need to produce
results quickly.

00:26:18.830 --> 00:26:21.110
And if they can't do
that with their funding,

00:26:21.110 --> 00:26:23.960
then they'll lose votes, and
they could even get kicked out.

00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:25.543
So I'm curious what
your thoughts are.

00:26:32.868 --> 00:26:34.265
[LAUGHS]

00:26:34.265 --> 00:26:36.740
AUDIENCE: Do you have any
interesting thoughts on that?

00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:38.010
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: You know,
Martin, I didn't come back

00:26:38.010 --> 00:26:39.430
to you when we resumed, so--

00:26:39.430 --> 00:26:40.350
AUDIENCE: Oh, the
point I was going to--

00:26:40.350 --> 00:26:42.480
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: I'm going
to give you a chance now.

00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:43.620
AUDIENCE: The point
I'm going to make,

00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:45.300
we were talking about
should scientists

00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:48.020
be these kind of
political leaders--

00:26:48.020 --> 00:26:50.238
I was going to make
a connection to VCs.

00:26:50.238 --> 00:26:51.780
VCs are the investment
entrepreneurs.

00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:53.610
They kind of look for
somebody that they say is kind

00:26:53.610 --> 00:26:56.210
of autistic, which is like they
are in their own little world

00:26:56.210 --> 00:26:58.710
and they're not very-- kind of
anti-social, but they focus--

00:26:58.710 --> 00:27:00.180
because of that, they focus
so much on the science

00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:01.500
that they're really,
really good at it.

00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:03.840
And you need someone to
sell it who's more social.

00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:06.810
So I was going to go forth from
the model of somebody who's--

00:27:06.810 --> 00:27:09.930
it's very rare to have
something can be both.

00:27:09.930 --> 00:27:11.905
[INAUDIBLE] I can't
really think of one.

00:27:11.905 --> 00:27:13.530
I also don't really
think of Bill Gates

00:27:13.530 --> 00:27:16.458
is a super sciencey person.

00:27:16.458 --> 00:27:18.750
It would be more like if
[INAUDIBLE] trying to become--

00:27:18.750 --> 00:27:20.870
for president.

00:27:20.870 --> 00:27:23.730
And Loomis was this person
who listened really well,

00:27:23.730 --> 00:27:25.750
and then could sell
the ideas really well.

00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:28.620
So I was going to make that
point, that connection where

00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:30.120
I couldn't really
see somebody who's

00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:31.470
really focused on their art.

00:27:31.470 --> 00:27:36.530
And also to Stephanie's
point, where yeah,

00:27:36.530 --> 00:27:38.538
that scientist might
lose the ability

00:27:38.538 --> 00:27:40.080
to make some key
discoveries, but now

00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:42.038
that he knows how the
actual environment works,

00:27:42.038 --> 00:27:44.160
he can actually make
any new discoveries

00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:46.950
with that framework in
mind, which might be

00:27:46.950 --> 00:27:48.260
better for his career overall.

00:27:48.260 --> 00:27:51.068
There's this one
idea from scientists,

00:27:51.068 --> 00:27:52.860
and also artists, where
it's your best work

00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:54.810
comes after your 40s.

00:27:54.810 --> 00:27:56.400
You can have long
period of doing

00:27:56.400 --> 00:28:01.795
something you think really,
really matters, but [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:01.795 --> 00:28:03.420
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
So let me translate

00:28:03.420 --> 00:28:07.170
your point, which is an
interesting one, back to Max,

00:28:07.170 --> 00:28:07.950
to your question.

00:28:07.950 --> 00:28:12.630
So in a way, we could argue
that the venture function is not

00:28:12.630 --> 00:28:16.980
designed into the
Vannevar Bush's model.

00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:20.040
That's what he's trying to
pull science out of, in a way.

00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:22.613
I'm extrapolating.

00:28:22.613 --> 00:28:25.280
AUDIENCE: So he's trying to find
some sort of long-term solution

00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:27.690
for this, right, and I was
trying to figure out, well,

00:28:27.690 --> 00:28:31.320
what is it that, given
our current system--

00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:33.510
as opposed to just
implementing his model,

00:28:33.510 --> 00:28:36.670
because it didn't
work the first time--

00:28:36.670 --> 00:28:39.000
instead of that,
is there any way

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:40.950
we can adapt what
we have currently

00:28:40.950 --> 00:28:44.280
to try to have almost a
hybrid between the two,

00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:46.568
so it gets the funding,
but there's still--

00:28:46.568 --> 00:28:48.360
you can still have
these separate branches?

00:29:00.637 --> 00:29:02.720
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: You've
stunned everybody, Max.

00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:03.398
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:29:03.398 --> 00:29:05.690
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: It was
too brilliant for our group.

00:29:05.690 --> 00:29:06.540
AUDIENCE: Or they're
just thinking,

00:29:06.540 --> 00:29:07.480
oh it's dumb question.

00:29:12.203 --> 00:29:13.870
The first, most obvious
thing I think of

00:29:13.870 --> 00:29:15.162
was just increased term limits.

00:29:15.162 --> 00:29:16.840
But of course, that
means you have--

00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:18.430
that's not great.

00:29:18.430 --> 00:29:20.178
That has its own disadvantages.

00:29:24.590 --> 00:29:27.130
AUDIENCE: I don't really
see the term limits

00:29:27.130 --> 00:29:30.010
as much as of an effect on
research, because I don't think

00:29:30.010 --> 00:29:32.380
everyday people are super
aware of the research that's

00:29:32.380 --> 00:29:33.740
going on the NIH and--

00:29:33.740 --> 00:29:36.255
AUDIENCE: True.

00:29:36.255 --> 00:29:38.380
AUDIENCE: I don't even know
how much of MIT funding

00:29:38.380 --> 00:29:39.910
is coming from the government.

00:29:39.910 --> 00:29:41.003
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: 70%.

00:29:41.003 --> 00:29:41.670
AUDIENCE: A lot.

00:29:41.670 --> 00:29:43.020
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:29:43.020 --> 00:29:47.170
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:47.170 --> 00:29:49.660
AUDIENCE: I don't know how much
public accountability there

00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:50.160
is to that.

00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:50.800
I don't--

00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:51.675
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:51.675 --> 00:29:54.280
AUDIENCE: --if it's as much
of a problem as just the lack

00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:56.530
of funding in general, rather
than the lack of funding

00:29:56.530 --> 00:29:57.640
connected to results.

00:29:57.640 --> 00:30:00.160
AUDIENCE: Or I
think that voting--

00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:04.300
votes are typically cast
based on, I would say,

00:30:04.300 --> 00:30:10.960
more social or moral
issues, rather than promises

00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:13.240
on science advancement.

00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:16.030
I can't think of a lot of people
who have campaigned recently

00:30:16.030 --> 00:30:16.600
based on--

00:30:20.230 --> 00:30:22.090
maybe I'm just
not in tune, but I

00:30:22.090 --> 00:30:25.870
don't think there have been
a lot of scientific promises

00:30:25.870 --> 00:30:27.790
or campaigns run on
scientific promises.

00:30:27.790 --> 00:30:29.498
And I'm not talking
about just president.

00:30:29.498 --> 00:30:32.090
I'm talking about two-term-- or
two-year term Congress people,

00:30:32.090 --> 00:30:33.300
as well.

00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:35.317
AUDIENCE: Maybe they should be.

00:30:35.317 --> 00:30:37.150
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: So
I want to bring Chloe

00:30:37.150 --> 00:30:38.950
into this discussion,
because we're rapidly

00:30:38.950 --> 00:30:40.340
moving into your territory.

00:30:40.340 --> 00:30:41.920
So why don't you
pose a question?

00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:46.420
AUDIENCE: OK, sort of related to
the topic that we were just on,

00:30:46.420 --> 00:30:49.120
the question that I found the
most interesting to think about

00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:52.500
from the Blanpied reading was--

00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:54.220
you mentioned it
with Harry Truman

00:30:54.220 --> 00:30:57.130
and also, I think, Harold
Smith, the director of the DOB,

00:30:57.130 --> 00:30:59.613
brought up similar concerns
that it was essentially

00:30:59.613 --> 00:31:01.030
unconstitutional
for the president

00:31:01.030 --> 00:31:04.990
to allocate funds and power to
a group of private citizens,

00:31:04.990 --> 00:31:08.920
for them to redistribute to
fund the scientific endeavors

00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:10.840
that they deemed worthy.

00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:12.780
So where do you
all have opinions

00:31:12.780 --> 00:31:15.220
on where we should draw the
line between wanting only

00:31:15.220 --> 00:31:17.572
our elected officials to
be responsible for handling

00:31:17.572 --> 00:31:19.030
taxpayer dollars,
and understanding

00:31:19.030 --> 00:31:21.670
the value of having our
politicians be advised

00:31:21.670 --> 00:31:22.990
by experts in various fields?

00:31:22.990 --> 00:31:26.040
And then off of that,
who ought to make sense--

00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:28.240
broad question-- not to
make scientific policy--

00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:29.890
politicians advised
by scientists,

00:31:29.890 --> 00:31:31.960
scientists appointed
by elected politicians,

00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:33.760
or-- back to your
point earlier--

00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:36.180
politicians who are scientists?

00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:37.818
Is it possible?

00:31:37.818 --> 00:31:39.610
AUDIENCE: The first
two sound very similar.

00:31:39.610 --> 00:31:41.020
I'm sorry, go ahead.

00:31:41.020 --> 00:31:45.880
AUDIENCE: I think that there
are multiple levels of fund

00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:50.500
allocations though, so
I think that there--

00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:54.070
in the current system, say
what the NSF, yes, politicians,

00:31:54.070 --> 00:32:00.370
I think, are sort of at the
top, and they decide how much--

00:32:00.370 --> 00:32:02.080
what the budget
is-- overall budget.

00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:06.260
But then within the NSF, there's
a scientific review process.

00:32:06.260 --> 00:32:10.240
So really the decision on
who is funded specifically

00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:12.730
is farmed out to
experts in the field.

00:32:12.730 --> 00:32:20.890
So I think that it's an OK
system that we have, because--

00:32:20.890 --> 00:32:22.900
maybe you're talking
about the top level,

00:32:22.900 --> 00:32:29.580
the original decisions on
allocation or budget needs.

00:32:29.580 --> 00:32:32.080
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Lily, let
me build on that for a second,

00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:34.080
just from a practical
perspective,

00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:35.080
on kind of how it works.

00:32:37.790 --> 00:32:40.610
Congress actually doesn't
interfere much, frankly,

00:32:40.610 --> 00:32:41.900
with scientific budgets.

00:32:41.900 --> 00:32:43.400
It leaves NIH alone.

00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:45.470
It leaves NSF alone.

00:32:45.470 --> 00:32:47.083
It'll occasionally
interfere with one

00:32:47.083 --> 00:32:49.250
of the defense R&D agencies,
particular when they're

00:32:49.250 --> 00:32:52.400
spending a lot of money on
actual physical project that

00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:55.790
may be related to science,
because that affects jobs

00:32:55.790 --> 00:32:57.660
and employment, stuff like that.

00:32:57.660 --> 00:33:01.310
But the government more--
it keeps its hands off DARPA

00:33:01.310 --> 00:33:03.200
almost entirely.

00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:05.480
The Congress actually
does a pretty good job

00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:09.710
in controlling itself
from intervening.

00:33:09.710 --> 00:33:11.210
And there's an
occasional exception,

00:33:11.210 --> 00:33:13.520
but they are pretty
careful about maintaining

00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:15.350
a hands-off attitude.

00:33:15.350 --> 00:33:17.630
In turn, the US is
organized-- again,

00:33:17.630 --> 00:33:20.330
at Vannevar Bush's behest--

00:33:20.330 --> 00:33:21.110
it's competitive.

00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:23.150
It's a competitive
system, with the exception

00:33:23.150 --> 00:33:24.525
of the Department
of Agriculture,

00:33:24.525 --> 00:33:27.830
which has a whole lot of science
entitlement funding based

00:33:27.830 --> 00:33:32.090
on allocations to land
grant agricultural programs.

00:33:32.090 --> 00:33:34.520
That's the only
non-competitive part.

00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:36.830
Scientists have got to
compete for the funding.

00:33:36.830 --> 00:33:39.530
That was part of Vannevar
Bush's original vision,

00:33:39.530 --> 00:33:40.400
and that remains.

00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:42.380
And that is a huge
strength of US science.

00:33:42.380 --> 00:33:46.135
Other systems don't do that.

00:33:46.135 --> 00:33:48.260
There's much more entitlement
science, for example,

00:33:48.260 --> 00:33:49.493
in German science.

00:33:49.493 --> 00:33:51.410
And they they're actually
trying to reorganize

00:33:51.410 --> 00:33:53.210
to put a more
competitive factor in,

00:33:53.210 --> 00:33:55.540
because they realized
the value of having

00:33:55.540 --> 00:33:58.260
the best minds battling each
other for the best research

00:33:58.260 --> 00:33:58.760
awards.

00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:01.490
And it's and it's
peer-reviewed, so scientists

00:34:01.490 --> 00:34:03.620
are analyzing and selecting
their own science.

00:34:03.620 --> 00:34:07.890
So overall, it's a
pretty dynamic process,

00:34:07.890 --> 00:34:10.370
and the government
isn't deciding what

00:34:10.370 --> 00:34:11.960
science is going to get funded.

00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:15.860
That was Vannevar
Bush's big fear.

00:34:15.860 --> 00:34:18.409
The other dynamic here is
that Vancouver bush came up

00:34:18.409 --> 00:34:21.820
with a design that fit
into a conservative model.

00:34:21.820 --> 00:34:24.170
In other words, he's not
interfering with industry.

00:34:24.170 --> 00:34:26.570
He's doing basic research.

00:34:26.570 --> 00:34:28.969
He's staying out of
industry's way, by

00:34:28.969 --> 00:34:31.100
and large, which was
another appealing

00:34:31.100 --> 00:34:34.940
part of the model from a
political design perspective

00:34:34.940 --> 00:34:36.500
is that he wouldn't
be, in effect,

00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:40.639
picking winners and losers in
the industrial applied space.

00:34:40.639 --> 00:34:43.442
So he pulls science
out of the system--

00:34:43.442 --> 00:34:45.650
out of the political system,
by and large, and that's

00:34:45.650 --> 00:34:48.530
more or less where it's been.

00:34:48.530 --> 00:34:51.739
Congress does make decisions
about overall funding,

00:34:51.739 --> 00:34:54.110
but they don't
really get involved,

00:34:54.110 --> 00:35:00.220
except to a very small extent in
actual scientific allocations.

00:35:00.220 --> 00:35:04.800
So that's kind of how the lines
got drawn in the actual system,

00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:05.640
as it played out.

00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:09.420
So in a way, Vannevar Bush got
a fair amount of what he wanted.

00:35:09.420 --> 00:35:11.730
His concern about political
interference in science

00:35:11.730 --> 00:35:13.080
has never really been realized.

00:35:13.080 --> 00:35:14.970
But then, of course,
most of it's basic.

00:35:19.110 --> 00:35:21.990
How about one more
point from each of you?

00:35:21.990 --> 00:35:24.660
Because I'm having
to watch the clock.

00:35:24.660 --> 00:35:26.770
AUDIENCE: So [INAUDIBLE]
actually mention

00:35:26.770 --> 00:35:29.370
an interesting
question that I found.

00:35:29.370 --> 00:35:31.230
So Bush states
that basic research

00:35:31.230 --> 00:35:33.300
is essentially non-commercial.

00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:36.090
It's not going to achieve
the attention it requires,

00:35:36.090 --> 00:35:37.200
if it's left to industry.

00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:41.160
So how common was this belief
at the time, and isn't it

00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:43.600
as common today?

00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:48.000
And has the situation improved
since Bush drafted this report?

00:35:52.450 --> 00:35:56.920
AUDIENCE: I think maybe we
can argue that basic research

00:35:56.920 --> 00:36:01.390
focuses on these long-term,
not very commercial endeavors

00:36:01.390 --> 00:36:05.530
because the point
is you won't see--

00:36:05.530 --> 00:36:08.470
it's understood
that you won't see

00:36:08.470 --> 00:36:11.260
immediate technological
or economic benefit

00:36:11.260 --> 00:36:13.060
from these kind of endeavors.

00:36:13.060 --> 00:36:15.110
They're kind of
exploratory in nature,

00:36:15.110 --> 00:36:18.130
and so you're going to get
exploratory, only exploratory.

00:36:18.130 --> 00:36:20.830
And maybe, just maybe you might
end up with lasers, or radar,

00:36:20.830 --> 00:36:22.210
or something.

00:36:22.210 --> 00:36:24.040
But the probability
is also pretty low.

00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:29.020
And so I think, by nature,
what we deem as basic research

00:36:29.020 --> 00:36:31.870
and what we hope comes
out of NSF and NIH

00:36:31.870 --> 00:36:35.860
funding allocated to these
basic research ideas isn't going

00:36:35.860 --> 00:36:40.810
to be picked up by commercial
or private investors,

00:36:40.810 --> 00:36:44.950
just because of the way
things are and work.

00:36:44.950 --> 00:36:49.840
And I think we definitely
have seen that in the cutback

00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:51.940
in calls for basic research.

00:36:51.940 --> 00:36:56.110
And then we haven't really seen
the funding levels aggregate

00:36:56.110 --> 00:37:00.610
pick up from sort of
government plus private.

00:37:00.610 --> 00:37:05.935
Once you do the math, it doesn't
equate to the same [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:05.935 --> 00:37:07.060
funding and basic research.

00:37:07.060 --> 00:37:10.180
Even if the government
decides to drop off,

00:37:10.180 --> 00:37:14.230
we don't see private investors
picking up the slack.

00:37:14.230 --> 00:37:16.480
You can argue that the
government can play both roles,

00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:18.895
we can do these public
private partnerships

00:37:18.895 --> 00:37:20.020
and also do basic research.

00:37:20.020 --> 00:37:21.910
But I don't think
private companies can

00:37:21.910 --> 00:37:23.480
have that flexibility
to do both,

00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:26.170
just because they can't operate
on these really long time

00:37:26.170 --> 00:37:27.805
cycles without any
promise of returns.

00:37:27.805 --> 00:37:28.930
AUDIENCE: Just a side note.

00:37:28.930 --> 00:37:31.910
In general, companies
that can do side research

00:37:31.910 --> 00:37:33.300
is because they're a monopoly.

00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:34.800
That's the only
kind of company that

00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:37.700
can do side research
like Xerox or Bell Labs.

00:37:42.106 --> 00:37:43.710
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
I'd say definitely

00:37:43.710 --> 00:37:45.880
has improved, at
least in my opinion.

00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:50.585
It seems that research
is more easily funded

00:37:50.585 --> 00:37:52.210
by the government,
although, of course,

00:37:52.210 --> 00:37:55.762
there are definitely
ebbs and flows in that.

00:37:55.762 --> 00:37:57.470
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
So the rationale here

00:37:57.470 --> 00:38:00.020
is that, for early
stage research,

00:38:00.020 --> 00:38:03.560
it's too risky for
industries to manage.

00:38:03.560 --> 00:38:05.690
They can't necessarily
assume that there's

00:38:05.690 --> 00:38:07.490
going to be any kind
of return anywhere

00:38:07.490 --> 00:38:10.700
in the plausible
future, so they just--

00:38:10.700 --> 00:38:11.825
they're not going to do it.

00:38:11.825 --> 00:38:14.200
It's really out of range of
what their shareholders would

00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:14.930
accept.

00:38:14.930 --> 00:38:17.240
They can do development,
as we talked about

00:38:17.240 --> 00:38:19.730
in the first class,
because that's

00:38:19.730 --> 00:38:22.160
much nearer-term
towards results.

00:38:22.160 --> 00:38:25.670
But the basic research stage is
much more problematic for them.

00:38:25.670 --> 00:38:27.670
And your point is
absolutely right,

00:38:27.670 --> 00:38:31.310
Martin, which is that the end
of the monopoly model in--

00:38:31.310 --> 00:38:34.250
for example, in the
communications sector,

00:38:34.250 --> 00:38:37.250
with the demise of
AT&T, that meant

00:38:37.250 --> 00:38:41.920
the end of AT&T's great
basic research lab system.

00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:45.933
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] I took a
class on open sourcing stuff.

00:38:45.933 --> 00:38:48.350
So I feel like if there's an
ability for a private company

00:38:48.350 --> 00:38:48.938
to do--

00:38:48.938 --> 00:38:50.480
they'll be doing
interesting research

00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:52.730
and decide we're never going
to do anything with this.

00:38:52.730 --> 00:38:54.410
Because this happens
a lot in companies,

00:38:54.410 --> 00:38:56.150
where you don't want to
disrupt an industry where

00:38:56.150 --> 00:38:58.010
it's not worth
pursuing business-wise,

00:38:58.010 --> 00:38:59.250
because it's too complicated.

00:38:59.250 --> 00:39:00.750
They'll go: we've
been through this.

00:39:00.750 --> 00:39:01.583
Do you guys want it?

00:39:01.583 --> 00:39:03.052
Do you want to buy it?

00:39:03.052 --> 00:39:04.760
I think that might be
an interesting one.

00:39:04.760 --> 00:39:06.510
I don't know if it's
been done [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:06.510 --> 00:39:09.820
AUDIENCE: It happens a lot in
bioinformatics and computer

00:39:09.820 --> 00:39:10.700
science.

00:39:10.700 --> 00:39:12.500
Websites like GitHub,
you know that that's

00:39:12.500 --> 00:39:15.122
the repository for
everyone else's scripts

00:39:15.122 --> 00:39:17.330
that they've already written,
and programs and stuff.

00:39:17.330 --> 00:39:19.520
But for a business, that
would be interesting.

00:39:19.520 --> 00:39:20.560
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Chloe,
how about a close out

00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:21.640
point from you?

00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:22.580
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:39:22.580 --> 00:39:25.430
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:25.430 --> 00:39:29.750
AUDIENCE: So I think it's
interesting to examine why--

00:39:29.750 --> 00:39:32.570
obviously, both Bush's
and Steelman's proposal

00:39:32.570 --> 00:39:36.370
encountered different
obstacles at different times,

00:39:36.370 --> 00:39:38.120
as we've already discussed.

00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:39.890
But ultimately,
it took the threat

00:39:39.890 --> 00:39:42.670
of technological
takeover by the Soviets

00:39:42.670 --> 00:39:45.200
with Sputnik for
a lot of impetus

00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:48.590
to exist to fund research, to
protect the educational STEM

00:39:48.590 --> 00:39:50.990
pipeline--

00:39:50.990 --> 00:39:55.325
which, tying back to our
earlier discussion of is it--

00:39:55.325 --> 00:39:57.200
do we have a system
structured right now such

00:39:57.200 --> 00:39:59.390
that the US places value
on this type of research

00:39:59.390 --> 00:40:02.130
outside of a stressor like war?

00:40:02.130 --> 00:40:04.010
It seems like, at
least at that point,

00:40:04.010 --> 00:40:07.137
it's hard to get
that ball rolling.

00:40:07.137 --> 00:40:09.470
Which again, is ironic, because
the whole discussion was

00:40:09.470 --> 00:40:13.490
started by Bush, who wanted
to draft this outline for what

00:40:13.490 --> 00:40:17.450
funding that research might
look like in a postwar era

00:40:17.450 --> 00:40:20.360
with the idea for an
institution like the NSF.

00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:21.410
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Good.

00:40:21.410 --> 00:40:22.910
All right, I'm going
to jump through

00:40:22.910 --> 00:40:24.800
so we can finish on time.

00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:26.606
The next two--

00:40:26.606 --> 00:40:27.890
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:27.890 --> 00:40:28.670
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: I'm sorry?

00:40:28.670 --> 00:40:30.378
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
I think it might be

00:40:30.378 --> 00:40:33.320
cool as kind of a fringe idea.

00:40:33.320 --> 00:40:36.145
So you might have--

00:40:36.145 --> 00:40:37.520
not really
investigating, but you

00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:42.843
might have an idea for a
pursuit in maybe basic research

00:40:42.843 --> 00:40:45.260
or something like that, but
your company might decide it's

00:40:45.260 --> 00:40:47.810
not worth it as a
business venture.

00:40:47.810 --> 00:40:50.660
But maybe it's a
secondary system

00:40:50.660 --> 00:40:52.610
like selling that--
like buying and selling

00:40:52.610 --> 00:40:55.100
that information might be cool.

00:40:55.100 --> 00:40:59.870
So like I have an idea that I
can't necessarily execute it

00:40:59.870 --> 00:41:02.465
for whatever reason, but
I can make the idea known,

00:41:02.465 --> 00:41:04.340
and then someone else
can pursue and pick up.

00:41:04.340 --> 00:41:05.548
AUDIENCE: Like Elon Musk did?

00:41:05.548 --> 00:41:08.000
AUDIENCE: Yeah, precisely.

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:09.440
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Right.

00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:12.050
Some people are working on
patent pools, for example,

00:41:12.050 --> 00:41:15.110
and amassing patent rights,
which may, in turn, be

00:41:15.110 --> 00:41:16.610
transferable and saleable.

00:41:16.610 --> 00:41:21.260
So there's work going on
in some of these points.

00:41:21.260 --> 00:41:23.000
I'm going to do the
closing two readings.

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:24.890
And Sanam, they're
both yours, right?

00:41:24.890 --> 00:41:25.580
OK.

00:41:25.580 --> 00:41:27.920
So I'm going to quickly
summarize this piece from Peter

00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:30.590
Singer that I put in there.

00:41:30.590 --> 00:41:38.590
Peter's piece is a terrific
research because, frankly--

00:41:38.590 --> 00:41:40.830
it's almost like doing
genealogical history.

00:41:40.830 --> 00:41:42.870
We know what the advance is.

00:41:42.870 --> 00:41:45.810
Figuring out the
science that emerge from

00:41:45.810 --> 00:41:49.590
is a really complicated process.

00:41:49.590 --> 00:41:54.870
But Peter, I thought,
very thoughtfully dug into

00:41:54.870 --> 00:41:57.120
and really built a lot
of the scientific history

00:41:57.120 --> 00:42:00.900
around a lot of advances
that we live off.

00:42:00.900 --> 00:42:04.080
The point here is
we get a lot of--

00:42:04.080 --> 00:42:07.170
I don't want to denigrate
Vannevar Bush's.

00:42:07.170 --> 00:42:09.970
Stokes takes it on, and
attacks it, and criticizes it,

00:42:09.970 --> 00:42:11.370
I think for some good reasons.

00:42:11.370 --> 00:42:14.880
But we've gotten a
lot out of that model.

00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:16.590
So federal research
support has just

00:42:16.590 --> 00:42:19.830
been critical to the development
of just an incredible array

00:42:19.830 --> 00:42:22.410
of advanced technologies,
and basic research

00:42:22.410 --> 00:42:24.030
is behind a lot of that.

00:42:24.030 --> 00:42:25.590
So it's a key enabler.

00:42:25.590 --> 00:42:28.560
It's a key US
comparative advantage.

00:42:28.560 --> 00:42:35.510
And interestingly, a big
advantage of basic research

00:42:35.510 --> 00:42:39.610
is that it puts you out on
the frontier of science,

00:42:39.610 --> 00:42:44.790
and you can get
scientific breakthroughs

00:42:44.790 --> 00:42:45.930
from basic research.

00:42:45.930 --> 00:42:50.400
If you're just doing incremental
applied work, particularly

00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:52.200
at the development
stage, you're not

00:42:52.200 --> 00:42:53.730
going to get the breakthroughs.

00:42:53.730 --> 00:42:57.360
But if your door is
open to the basic stuff,

00:42:57.360 --> 00:43:00.000
there's a lot of potential
breakthroughs lurking in there.

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:03.120
Now, getting them into
implementation is not simple,

00:43:03.120 --> 00:43:06.840
but it is, overall, I think
an advantage in the US system

00:43:06.840 --> 00:43:09.337
that we have strong
basic research.

00:43:09.337 --> 00:43:10.170
What have we gotten?

00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:15.270
NSF supported the
original funding

00:43:15.270 --> 00:43:18.750
for the Google search engine.

00:43:18.750 --> 00:43:23.550
GPS was founded on a
purely scientific Navy

00:43:23.550 --> 00:43:24.990
effort around atomic clocks.

00:43:24.990 --> 00:43:28.020
That's one of the foundational
technologies, as well

00:43:28.020 --> 00:43:32.010
as DOD's Navstar system,
and work by DARPA.

00:43:32.010 --> 00:43:35.790
Supercomputing really came
out of the DOE National Labs.

00:43:35.790 --> 00:43:38.460
Speech recognition
came out of DARPA.

00:43:38.460 --> 00:43:41.400
They funded all the work
behind Siri originally.

00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:43.470
Siri is Stanford
Research Institute.

00:43:43.470 --> 00:43:49.430
That was the development entity,
a basic research nonprofit.

00:43:49.430 --> 00:43:51.270
DARPA, as you know,
did the ARPANET,

00:43:51.270 --> 00:43:53.940
which led to the internet.

00:43:53.940 --> 00:43:56.550
NIST did closed captioning.

00:43:56.550 --> 00:43:58.350
All kinds of
critical technologies

00:43:58.350 --> 00:44:01.620
came out of basic research, as
well as defense technologies

00:44:01.620 --> 00:44:03.060
for the smartphone.

00:44:03.060 --> 00:44:06.360
In energy, the whole
fracking revolution

00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:09.310
came out of the Department
of Energy's lab research.

00:44:09.310 --> 00:44:12.260
LEDs came from the Air Force.

00:44:12.260 --> 00:44:17.670
MRIs came out of NSF and NIH.

00:44:17.670 --> 00:44:18.547
The list goes on.

00:44:18.547 --> 00:44:20.880
Human Genome Project, an
absolutely fundamental research

00:44:20.880 --> 00:44:25.470
project, was led and
significantly influenced

00:44:25.470 --> 00:44:26.760
by NIH.

00:44:26.760 --> 00:44:29.400
Out of mathematics comes
things like reverse auctions,

00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:33.330
which is a tool that we use
in a number of circumstances,

00:44:33.330 --> 00:44:34.425
such as spectrum auctions.

00:44:39.300 --> 00:44:41.970
One of the great
absolute breakthroughs

00:44:41.970 --> 00:44:45.060
of early 20th
century agriculture,

00:44:45.060 --> 00:44:47.370
a huge enabler in that
sector, is the development

00:44:47.370 --> 00:44:49.268
of hybrid crops,
particularly hybrid corn,

00:44:49.268 --> 00:44:51.810
which transforms the production
of corn in the United States.

00:44:51.810 --> 00:44:53.160
Absolutely transformative.

00:44:53.160 --> 00:44:55.980
Comes out of obscure
agricultural research stations

00:44:55.980 --> 00:44:57.900
in places like Connecticut.

00:44:57.900 --> 00:45:02.760
So there's a lot that we've
gotten out of basic research.

00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:06.300
You can barely see this,
but it is a famous diagram

00:45:06.300 --> 00:45:07.530
in computer science.

00:45:07.530 --> 00:45:10.800
So it's called the
tire tracks diagram.

00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:12.750
And you see these
kind of lanes and then

00:45:12.750 --> 00:45:16.590
you see these tire tracks
weaving in and out of them.

00:45:16.590 --> 00:45:20.730
And these are the foundational
work in computer science

00:45:20.730 --> 00:45:24.930
and where it came from,
with university work leading

00:45:24.930 --> 00:45:26.520
and almost initially
[INAUDIBLE]----

00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:29.130
that's federally-funded
university research--

00:45:29.130 --> 00:45:31.980
being often picked up
at a subsequent stage

00:45:31.980 --> 00:45:36.030
by industry R&D, fed from
university to industry,

00:45:36.030 --> 00:45:38.820
and then eventually emerging
in the green lines as billion

00:45:38.820 --> 00:45:41.670
dollar product lines,
and then eventually,

00:45:41.670 --> 00:45:45.810
the wider line, 10 billion
or more product lines.

00:45:45.810 --> 00:45:48.900
So these are foundational
research efforts.

00:45:48.900 --> 00:45:53.580
These are the technology
results that emerged.

00:45:53.580 --> 00:45:57.240
There's a rich literature
behind every single one

00:45:57.240 --> 00:45:59.400
of those lines--

00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:02.020
small lines on this map.

00:46:02.020 --> 00:46:04.200
So that famous
tire track diagram

00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:08.190
is a critical diagram
developed by NSF

00:46:08.190 --> 00:46:11.730
in explaining how the computing
revolution came about.

00:46:11.730 --> 00:46:13.410
We're now at Donald
Stokes, and I'm just

00:46:13.410 --> 00:46:15.000
going to summarize very briefly.

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:18.750
Stokes is a very
interesting figure here.

00:46:18.750 --> 00:46:22.110
He was dean of the Woodrow
Wilson School at Princeton.

00:46:22.110 --> 00:46:28.470
And he dies of leukemia very
tragically, and pretty early.

00:46:28.470 --> 00:46:30.790
This is the last big thing.

00:46:30.790 --> 00:46:34.065
Pasteur's quadrant is the
last big project he works on.

00:46:37.790 --> 00:46:40.850
There's a lot of emotion in
this book that he puts together.

00:46:40.850 --> 00:46:42.590
He feels these
issues very strongly,

00:46:42.590 --> 00:46:44.870
as you could tell from his text.

00:46:44.870 --> 00:46:48.740
And what he's confronting
is the relationship

00:46:48.740 --> 00:46:51.170
between science and
government, which we've been

00:46:51.170 --> 00:46:55.430
trying to dissect earlier on.

00:46:55.430 --> 00:47:02.560
And he takes on the
Vannevar Bush basic research

00:47:02.560 --> 00:47:07.240
model and talks about its
weaknesses and failures.

00:47:07.240 --> 00:47:09.460
So federal support
of basic research--

00:47:12.120 --> 00:47:15.030
his goal was to curtail
governmental control

00:47:15.030 --> 00:47:16.530
of the performance
of that research.

00:47:16.530 --> 00:47:19.410
That was one of the key
things Bush was up to.

00:47:19.410 --> 00:47:21.720
And he aimed to
create, through NSF,

00:47:21.720 --> 00:47:24.510
an entity with cross science
authority based on a way,

00:47:24.510 --> 00:47:27.490
as I said earlier, on his
wartime scientific organization

00:47:27.490 --> 00:47:27.990
attempts.

00:47:30.920 --> 00:47:34.550
The rationale behind
creating NSF and supporting

00:47:34.550 --> 00:47:37.490
basic research is
that basic research

00:47:37.490 --> 00:47:42.590
is to be performed without
thought of practical ends.

00:47:42.590 --> 00:47:46.440
That's one foundational feature.

00:47:46.440 --> 00:47:47.390
That's what it is.

00:47:47.390 --> 00:47:48.950
Let's not think
about practical ends,

00:47:48.950 --> 00:47:50.510
let's just do the research.

00:47:50.510 --> 00:47:55.275
And then secondly, basic
research will be, he argues--

00:47:55.275 --> 00:47:57.380
Vannevar Bush
argues-- the pacemaker

00:47:57.380 --> 00:47:59.960
of technological advance.

00:47:59.960 --> 00:48:04.990
So again, he has got
a pipeline model.

00:48:04.990 --> 00:48:06.070
Do basic research.

00:48:06.070 --> 00:48:07.292
Dump that into the pipeline.

00:48:07.292 --> 00:48:08.500
Mysterious things will occur.

00:48:08.500 --> 00:48:11.410
Great technologies will emerge.

00:48:11.410 --> 00:48:14.260
And his assumption is that
dumping that basic research

00:48:14.260 --> 00:48:18.940
will pace what is going
on inside that pipeline.

00:48:18.940 --> 00:48:21.502
It is a left right model.

00:48:21.502 --> 00:48:22.960
The government is
dumping something

00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:24.460
in on the left side
of the pipeline.

00:48:24.460 --> 00:48:28.860
Great stuff is emerging on the
right side of the pipeline.

00:48:28.860 --> 00:48:31.990
Now, remember Richard Nelson.

00:48:31.990 --> 00:48:34.360
Nelson talked about the
way in which technology

00:48:34.360 --> 00:48:40.050
influences science, as well as
science influencing technology.

00:48:40.050 --> 00:48:44.470
Vannevar Bush does not
have a two-way street

00:48:44.470 --> 00:48:46.900
of interaction between the two.

00:48:46.900 --> 00:48:51.040
He has organized US science
on a one-way street,

00:48:51.040 --> 00:48:52.260
a left to right--

00:48:52.260 --> 00:48:56.510
it's not two lanes,
it's left to right.

00:48:56.510 --> 00:49:00.620
So Stokes argues that that
is a critical organizational

00:49:00.620 --> 00:49:06.740
failure, that that
radically limits

00:49:06.740 --> 00:49:10.450
what you're going to be able
to get out of your system.

00:49:10.450 --> 00:49:13.750
Skipping ahead here,
to conclude that point,

00:49:13.750 --> 00:49:17.200
the Bush paradigm of the
linear relation between science

00:49:17.200 --> 00:49:20.830
and technology, Stokes
argues, bears no resemblance

00:49:20.830 --> 00:49:22.990
to their actual connection.

00:49:22.990 --> 00:49:25.480
The reality is it's
a two-way street,

00:49:25.480 --> 00:49:27.680
and we've only organized
a one-way street.

00:49:27.680 --> 00:49:30.630
And therefore, this interaction
is not going to occur.

00:49:30.630 --> 00:49:33.070
There are deep ties between
science and technology.

00:49:33.070 --> 00:49:36.740
They're interactive,
they're not linear.

00:49:36.740 --> 00:49:47.880
So the Vannevar Bush model
lasts and is respected really

00:49:47.880 --> 00:49:50.090
until the 1980s.

00:49:50.090 --> 00:49:51.480
And what's going
on in the 1980s?

00:49:51.480 --> 00:49:54.300
We talked about this in class 3.

00:49:54.300 --> 00:49:57.000
That's the great
competition with Japan.

00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:59.550
And Japan builds a much
more connected system,

00:49:59.550 --> 00:50:01.320
much deeper ties
between industry

00:50:01.320 --> 00:50:03.060
and its research system--

00:50:03.060 --> 00:50:07.050
in fact, its research system
is industry-led really.

00:50:07.050 --> 00:50:09.450
The US has got this
disaggregated system.

00:50:09.450 --> 00:50:11.370
Basic research is
off on the side.

00:50:11.370 --> 00:50:14.520
The argument is the US is coming
up with the breakthroughs.

00:50:14.520 --> 00:50:16.470
It's not able to implement them.

00:50:16.470 --> 00:50:18.360
It is not turning
them into industries.

00:50:18.360 --> 00:50:20.550
In fact, Japan is taking
the US breakthroughs

00:50:20.550 --> 00:50:22.380
and turning them
into industries.

00:50:22.380 --> 00:50:25.170
That's the story of a lot
of consumer electronics

00:50:25.170 --> 00:50:27.090
in that period of time.

00:50:27.090 --> 00:50:31.082
And Stokes is suggesting we've
got to get down to basics here.

00:50:31.082 --> 00:50:33.040
We've got a fundamental
organizational problem.

00:50:33.040 --> 00:50:35.080
It's not an accident
that this occurred,

00:50:35.080 --> 00:50:37.510
it's the way we organize things.

00:50:37.510 --> 00:50:39.080
That's why it happened.

00:50:39.080 --> 00:50:42.190
And this is a very anxious
moment in US political history

00:50:42.190 --> 00:50:44.140
when he's writing
here, because we're

00:50:44.140 --> 00:50:47.440
starting to de-industrialize,
and with lots

00:50:47.440 --> 00:50:54.010
of effects on a lot of
people in the United States.

00:50:54.010 --> 00:50:58.810
So Stokes argues that Vannevar
Bush's model is static,

00:50:58.810 --> 00:51:01.510
whereas, in fact, the
reality is dynamic,

00:51:01.510 --> 00:51:04.750
and the static linear model
is not the right model.

00:51:04.750 --> 00:51:09.070
So he short circuited
the thinking process.

00:51:09.070 --> 00:51:12.250
He assumed, because
you do basic research,

00:51:12.250 --> 00:51:14.000
implementation would follow.

00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:18.220
But it doesn't necessarily
follow, Stokes argues.

00:51:18.220 --> 00:51:19.660
It's one-dimensional.

00:51:23.270 --> 00:51:26.580
Stokes's quadrant picture
is an important picture

00:51:26.580 --> 00:51:29.990
to understand, because this is
the classic critique of many

00:51:29.990 --> 00:51:32.450
of Vannevar Bush model, which
is the classic critique of US

00:51:32.450 --> 00:51:34.910
science organization.

00:51:34.910 --> 00:51:36.590
So all this stuff
we're reading here

00:51:36.590 --> 00:51:40.880
is pretty noted material
in US science history.

00:51:40.880 --> 00:51:43.175
Here is his Pasteur's
quadrant, which you all saw.

00:51:45.800 --> 00:51:49.670
So there's four
quadrants, Stokes's mind,

00:51:49.670 --> 00:51:51.140
and there's two axes--

00:51:51.140 --> 00:51:53.570
are you searching for a
fundamental understanding, yes

00:51:53.570 --> 00:51:56.517
or no, and are you
considering use,

00:51:56.517 --> 00:51:58.100
considering the
utility of what you're

00:51:58.100 --> 00:52:01.160
researching-- no and yes.

00:52:01.160 --> 00:52:05.000
So he has this nice
quadrant, and then

00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:06.653
to the upper-left
quadrant, where

00:52:06.653 --> 00:52:08.570
you're searching for
fundamental understanding

00:52:08.570 --> 00:52:10.700
but you're not
considering use, that's

00:52:10.700 --> 00:52:13.670
like physics in the '20s.

00:52:13.670 --> 00:52:15.110
That's like Niels Bohr.

00:52:15.110 --> 00:52:17.030
They're figuring out
particle physics.

00:52:17.030 --> 00:52:20.710
They don't see any
utility for this.

00:52:20.710 --> 00:52:23.020
The idea comes along later
about atomic weapons,

00:52:23.020 --> 00:52:25.240
but that's decades away.

00:52:25.240 --> 00:52:28.318
So yes, we can understand
that is an interesting moment,

00:52:28.318 --> 00:52:29.860
search for fundamental
understanding,

00:52:29.860 --> 00:52:32.235
no consideration, really just
trying to understand stuff.

00:52:34.700 --> 00:52:36.880
Then there's what he
calls Pasteur's quadrant,

00:52:36.880 --> 00:52:40.550
and he argues this is the
one that Vannevar Bush's

00:52:40.550 --> 00:52:43.550
model misses completely.

00:52:43.550 --> 00:52:46.550
He's trying to organize as
though its particle physics,

00:52:46.550 --> 00:52:48.980
but a lot of stuff isn't.

00:52:48.980 --> 00:52:53.270
So Louis Pasteur, he's searching
for fundamental understanding.

00:52:53.270 --> 00:52:57.770
He's doing microbiology at
a really fundamental scale,

00:52:57.770 --> 00:52:59.600
but he's certainly
considering use.

00:52:59.600 --> 00:53:03.230
He doesn't want kids to
die of bad milk in Paris.

00:53:03.230 --> 00:53:04.820
He's considering use.

00:53:04.820 --> 00:53:06.470
He's up to something here.

00:53:06.470 --> 00:53:08.720
He's after a medical fix.

00:53:08.720 --> 00:53:11.660
So that's a very good example
of basic research being

00:53:11.660 --> 00:53:14.720
driven by consideration of use.

00:53:14.720 --> 00:53:17.710
And Stokes doesn't want to
eliminate this quadrant--

00:53:17.710 --> 00:53:19.160
he knows how productive it is--

00:53:19.160 --> 00:53:22.070
but he sure wants to add
consideration of this quadrant.

00:53:22.070 --> 00:53:25.640
Now, what are the
other two quadrants?

00:53:25.640 --> 00:53:28.250
No search for fundamental
understanding,

00:53:28.250 --> 00:53:29.420
and consideration of use.

00:53:29.420 --> 00:53:32.120
So in here he puts
Thomas Edison.

00:53:32.120 --> 00:53:33.990
That's like the light bulb.

00:53:33.990 --> 00:53:35.990
Thomas Edison doesn't
really care about physics.

00:53:35.990 --> 00:53:38.840
He just cares about
the light bulb.

00:53:38.840 --> 00:53:41.280
But it turns out to be a
little more complicated,

00:53:41.280 --> 00:53:43.610
and we'll talk about
this in class 7.

00:53:43.610 --> 00:53:48.410
But Edison has got
scientists in that room,

00:53:48.410 --> 00:53:50.990
in that idea factory,
as he calls it,

00:53:50.990 --> 00:53:56.780
in Menlo Park, New Jersey, that
frame 100-foot-long building.

00:53:56.780 --> 00:53:59.270
And they are onto some
scientific ideas here.

00:53:59.270 --> 00:54:01.520
And there is something called
the Edison effect, which

00:54:01.520 --> 00:54:03.410
actually helps explain
electron theory,

00:54:03.410 --> 00:54:06.830
that Edison himself and some
of the other crew come up with.

00:54:06.830 --> 00:54:12.260
So there is science evolving
out of the technology

00:54:12.260 --> 00:54:14.750
that they're pursuing.

00:54:14.750 --> 00:54:18.350
So it's consideration
of use, but they

00:54:18.350 --> 00:54:21.560
are finding some fundamental
understandings here,

00:54:21.560 --> 00:54:23.067
because it is a two-way street.

00:54:23.067 --> 00:54:24.650
Now, the one that
makes no sense to me

00:54:24.650 --> 00:54:28.130
is, is there anybody
really is not

00:54:28.130 --> 00:54:30.710
searching for
fundamental understanding

00:54:30.710 --> 00:54:32.960
and not considering use?

00:54:32.960 --> 00:54:34.400
Who would do that?

00:54:34.400 --> 00:54:35.150
Who would do that?

00:54:35.150 --> 00:54:39.550
So Stokes says, oh, Darwin.

00:54:39.550 --> 00:54:42.895
Gets on a boat, has
a nice ocean voyage--

00:54:42.895 --> 00:54:44.270
AUDIENCE: Sounds
like fun though.

00:54:44.270 --> 00:54:46.312
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: --walks
around the Galapagos,

00:54:46.312 --> 00:54:48.732
evolution dawns.

00:54:48.732 --> 00:54:49.940
It's not the way it happened.

00:54:49.940 --> 00:54:52.490
He gets on the Beagle
because he already

00:54:52.490 --> 00:54:57.320
has developed a lot
of evolution theory.

00:54:57.320 --> 00:54:58.840
In fact, his father
is a scientist

00:54:58.840 --> 00:55:00.440
who's been working
on it before him,

00:55:00.440 --> 00:55:06.420
so he has a very good idea of
why he's getting on that ship.

00:55:06.420 --> 00:55:09.390
So I don't really know anybody
who quite fits there, because I

00:55:09.390 --> 00:55:10.770
don't really think Darwin does.

00:55:10.770 --> 00:55:12.360
Darwin really as
a pretty good idea

00:55:12.360 --> 00:55:13.830
what scientific
theories he's going

00:55:13.830 --> 00:55:17.640
to be pursuing, as he
sails around the world.

00:55:17.640 --> 00:55:21.030
So I'm open to suggestions, if
anybody can think of someone.

00:55:21.030 --> 00:55:24.630
But I think he feels this blank
in because it's a quadrant.

00:55:24.630 --> 00:55:27.210
He has to put
something in there.

00:55:27.210 --> 00:55:29.220
How does he think
it really works?

00:55:29.220 --> 00:55:33.900
He comes up with this complex
diagram, which is very--

00:55:33.900 --> 00:55:36.210
it's a little hard to follow.

00:55:36.210 --> 00:55:39.900
He calls it Stokes's
dynamic model.

00:55:39.900 --> 00:55:43.050
And you can see that
use-inspired research

00:55:43.050 --> 00:55:44.070
is the big one.

00:55:44.070 --> 00:55:45.510
Then there's pure
basic research,

00:55:45.510 --> 00:55:47.580
and then there's
purely-applied research.

00:55:47.580 --> 00:55:49.260
And then there's
this kind of system

00:55:49.260 --> 00:55:51.190
between early understanding,
improved understanding,

00:55:51.190 --> 00:55:53.232
and improved technology,
and existing technology.

00:55:53.232 --> 00:55:55.440
And everything swirling
around, but this

00:55:55.440 --> 00:55:56.640
is right at the center.

00:55:56.640 --> 00:55:59.310
That's kind of his idea
of how it really works.

00:55:59.310 --> 00:56:00.805
And his critique
of Vannevar Bush

00:56:00.805 --> 00:56:03.930
is you're putting
all your bets here,

00:56:03.930 --> 00:56:08.160
and you have to think
about this, as well.

00:56:08.160 --> 00:56:09.580
So that's Stokes's critique.

00:56:12.400 --> 00:56:16.210
And the fact that the US
was doing great science

00:56:16.210 --> 00:56:20.330
and not making it
is what drives him

00:56:20.330 --> 00:56:23.330
to this set of realizations
about these fundamentals of how

00:56:23.330 --> 00:56:27.470
we've organized our science and
technology system in the US.

00:56:27.470 --> 00:56:30.110
So Sanam, it's all yours.

00:56:30.110 --> 00:56:34.820
AUDIENCE: OK, well, I guess I'll
just start with some thoughts

00:56:34.820 --> 00:56:38.210
that I had on basic research
in general from both these two

00:56:38.210 --> 00:56:39.680
readings.

00:56:39.680 --> 00:56:44.780
So it seems, we've been reading,
a major downfall or obstacle

00:56:44.780 --> 00:56:46.550
to basic research is
that the payoffs are

00:56:46.550 --> 00:56:49.417
risky and uncertain,
especially in the short run.

00:56:49.417 --> 00:56:51.500
And that's kind of what
shareholders are generally

00:56:51.500 --> 00:56:55.130
most concerned about
is short on profits.

00:56:55.130 --> 00:56:58.070
And so that kind of hinders
the long-term investments

00:56:58.070 --> 00:56:59.960
in basic research,
which potentially

00:56:59.960 --> 00:57:03.350
have really large positive
externalities, as we've

00:57:03.350 --> 00:57:04.940
been seeing.

00:57:04.940 --> 00:57:05.930
And there's also--

00:57:05.930 --> 00:57:07.570
I think Stokes mentioned this--

00:57:07.570 --> 00:57:11.780
there's also a low incentive
because the original investor

00:57:11.780 --> 00:57:14.330
often doesn't reap
the most benefits

00:57:14.330 --> 00:57:17.720
from whatever eventually
comes of the basic research.

00:57:17.720 --> 00:57:20.330
And the profits are
spread throughout society,

00:57:20.330 --> 00:57:22.250
and not always
concentrated [INAUDIBLE]..

00:57:22.250 --> 00:57:28.340
So investing in and
instigating basic research is--

00:57:28.340 --> 00:57:31.580
there's a lower
incentive for that.

00:57:31.580 --> 00:57:33.980
And I think that's an
argument to classify it

00:57:33.980 --> 00:57:36.125
as a public good,
which is really

00:57:36.125 --> 00:57:38.000
in favor of saying the
government should be--

00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:39.417
or federal support
should be there

00:57:39.417 --> 00:57:43.250
for providing this public
good quote, unquote

00:57:43.250 --> 00:57:44.330
"of basic research."

00:57:44.330 --> 00:57:47.210
And I think that's a very good
argument for the necessity

00:57:47.210 --> 00:57:48.758
of federal support.

00:57:48.758 --> 00:57:50.300
But the other thing
I was thinking of

00:57:50.300 --> 00:57:56.920
is that are there ways of
expanding this from just--

00:57:56.920 --> 00:57:58.520
the responsibility,
shifting it just

00:57:58.520 --> 00:58:03.140
from that of the federal
government to other actors?

00:58:03.140 --> 00:58:05.870
So some thoughts that I had
when I was doing these readings

00:58:05.870 --> 00:58:06.715
were--

00:58:06.715 --> 00:58:08.090
and I'll put this
question to you

00:58:08.090 --> 00:58:11.750
guys-- is there a way to
change the payoff structure

00:58:11.750 --> 00:58:14.870
so that the responsibility
to provide funding

00:58:14.870 --> 00:58:19.940
for basic research can be
on industries, as well?

00:58:19.940 --> 00:58:23.120
Or is there a way to have
an integrated system that

00:58:23.120 --> 00:58:26.540
encourages multiple and
synergistic benefits

00:58:26.540 --> 00:58:29.230
that both firms, private
actors, and maybe

00:58:29.230 --> 00:58:32.990
even some public actors all
want to kind of buy into?

00:58:32.990 --> 00:58:36.740
And I think that
gets us closer to--

00:58:36.740 --> 00:58:41.150
Singer mentions the rich
ecosystem following post--

00:58:41.150 --> 00:58:43.790
after the war, where
it wasn't a situation

00:58:43.790 --> 00:58:47.300
of a lone innovator working
by themselves or anything.

00:58:50.030 --> 00:58:53.978
So that's one of the main
things I've been trying

00:58:53.978 --> 00:58:55.270
to process with these readings.

00:58:55.270 --> 00:58:57.410
So I guess the more
general question to you

00:58:57.410 --> 00:59:00.860
all would be with--

00:59:03.680 --> 00:59:07.940
how to change the system so
that private and public funding

00:59:07.940 --> 00:59:11.060
relationships can work
together, and also

00:59:11.060 --> 00:59:14.120
can be cognizant of the
different agendas and goals

00:59:14.120 --> 00:59:18.500
of the different actors within
the institutionalized science

00:59:18.500 --> 00:59:20.776
framework that we've
been looking at.

00:59:20.776 --> 00:59:21.722
Any thoughts?

00:59:25.980 --> 00:59:29.400
AUDIENCE: I wonder who
it connects to the energy

00:59:29.400 --> 00:59:32.270
industry [INAUDIBLE]

00:59:32.270 --> 00:59:35.040
AUDIENCE: I feel like
I'm repeating myself,

00:59:35.040 --> 00:59:38.782
but when I was first here, we
talked about patient capital

00:59:38.782 --> 00:59:39.990
and this breakthrough energy.

00:59:39.990 --> 00:59:45.090
And [INAUDIBLE] one of the
proposals there was definitely

00:59:45.090 --> 00:59:46.170
a public partner--

00:59:46.170 --> 00:59:50.350
a public private partnership
with different countries,

00:59:50.350 --> 00:59:51.210
including the US.

00:59:51.210 --> 00:59:52.752
And unfortunately,
it's not happening

00:59:52.752 --> 00:59:55.500
in the US of committing
to double their R&D

00:59:55.500 --> 00:59:56.670
budgets around energy.

00:59:56.670 --> 00:59:58.830
And then, again, this
is just Bill Gates

00:59:58.830 --> 01:00:00.060
and his billionaires club.

01:00:00.060 --> 01:00:02.580
But it could be other
sources of private capital,

01:00:02.580 --> 01:00:05.940
and we're starting to see
some other sources pledging

01:00:05.940 --> 01:00:08.790
to pick up what that--

01:00:08.790 --> 01:00:11.160
what they were calling
mission innovation that

01:00:11.160 --> 01:00:15.480
bringing basic research
ideas further along,

01:00:15.480 --> 01:00:17.440
pick those up, and
incubate them longer.

01:00:23.880 --> 01:00:25.290
The MIT Energy
Initiative doesn't

01:00:25.290 --> 01:00:28.920
solve all the world's problems,
but there's definitely

01:00:28.920 --> 01:00:30.570
early stage research
that we fund--

01:00:30.570 --> 01:00:34.430
that part of every company's
membership they put

01:00:34.430 --> 01:00:39.210
$100,000 a year into a pool, and
we fund what we call commonly

01:00:39.210 --> 01:00:42.720
around MIT different people
are doing seed grants.

01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:45.803
So I could go on about
that, but we have--

01:00:45.803 --> 01:00:48.220
AUDIENCE: Do you mean like in
Media Lab, because the Media

01:00:48.220 --> 01:00:50.190
Lab models--

01:00:50.190 --> 01:00:55.667
I forget how much they get paid
for each company [INAUDIBLE]

01:00:55.667 --> 01:00:57.250
AUDIENCE: We have
something like that,

01:00:57.250 --> 01:00:59.822
but nobody gets IP
at the Media Lab.

01:00:59.822 --> 01:01:01.530
Nobody gets IP for
what I just described,

01:01:01.530 --> 01:01:04.202
for the early stage stuff.

01:01:04.202 --> 01:01:05.910
Because we also bring
in like $30 million

01:01:05.910 --> 01:01:09.690
a year of money for
sponsored research.

01:01:09.690 --> 01:01:13.220
But Bill, I don't know if
you want to say anything

01:01:13.220 --> 01:01:17.880
that ARPA-E. That's also a part
of the Department of Energy

01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:21.330
that's modeled after DARPA, that
definitely funds early stage.

01:01:21.330 --> 01:01:25.980
And a bunch of MIT faculty
have gotten those grants.

01:01:25.980 --> 01:01:28.230
I don't know how much it's
under threat at the moment.

01:01:28.230 --> 01:01:29.438
I guess a piece of ARPA-E is.

01:01:29.438 --> 01:01:31.772
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: ARPA-E
is proposed to be eliminated.

01:01:31.772 --> 01:01:33.260
AUDIENCE: The total piece.

01:01:33.260 --> 01:01:33.810
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Yes.

01:01:33.810 --> 01:01:34.760
AUDIENCE: It's not even
a lot of money, right?

01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:35.700
It's like $103 million?

01:01:35.700 --> 01:01:37.283
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
It's $300 million.

01:01:37.283 --> 01:01:39.577
AUDIENCE: 300, OK.

01:01:39.577 --> 01:01:41.660
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Only
at the federal government

01:01:41.660 --> 01:01:43.035
would that not be
a lot of money.

01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:49.178
AUDIENCE: Does any of that
address what you were--

01:01:49.178 --> 01:01:50.720
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
But Sanam, you're

01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:52.262
driving it really
interesting points.

01:01:52.262 --> 01:01:54.212
What are some other
organizational models

01:01:54.212 --> 01:01:56.420
that might help us get around
some of these dilemmas?

01:01:56.420 --> 01:01:59.618
And it's a really
intriguing set of questions.

01:02:03.008 --> 01:02:04.550
AUDIENCE: Going back
to some of the--

01:02:04.550 --> 01:02:06.717
not even organizational
stuff, but some of the stuff

01:02:06.717 --> 01:02:09.020
that we talked about
earlier like new accounting

01:02:09.020 --> 01:02:12.235
methods, or increased
tax benefits

01:02:12.235 --> 01:02:16.630
for doing basic science
research and things like that.

01:02:16.630 --> 01:02:20.310
If you don't mind, I had a
question about this reading.

01:02:20.310 --> 01:02:27.520
So he kind of pokes holes in
Bush's linear relationship

01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:30.760
between basic R&D and
development-- or basic research

01:02:30.760 --> 01:02:32.770
and development.

01:02:32.770 --> 01:02:36.490
So he creates this quadrant,
and I didn't really

01:02:36.490 --> 01:02:40.660
gather from it so much what he
was recommending from a policy

01:02:40.660 --> 01:02:43.880
perspective how
you de-distribute

01:02:43.880 --> 01:02:49.030
funding across those three
or four sections differently.

01:02:49.030 --> 01:02:55.810
I didn't see that much in
the reading [INAUDIBLE]

01:02:55.810 --> 01:02:58.600
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Right.

01:02:58.600 --> 01:03:00.520
In a way, Matthew,
you're asking,

01:03:00.520 --> 01:03:05.530
is Stokes attacking what's
really kind of a paper tiger?

01:03:05.530 --> 01:03:09.148
Does this system that
Stokes is describing

01:03:09.148 --> 01:03:10.690
of the federal
government really only

01:03:10.690 --> 01:03:15.630
funding pure basic research
along the Vannevar Bush lines--

01:03:15.630 --> 01:03:17.440
does that really exist?

01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:19.610
And I think there actually
is a serious question.

01:03:19.610 --> 01:03:22.360
So in the next
class, class 6, we're

01:03:22.360 --> 01:03:24.160
going to dive pretty
deeply into that

01:03:24.160 --> 01:03:26.680
question-- how does the
system actually work?

01:03:31.477 --> 01:03:33.310
I've just described the
Vannevar Bush model,

01:03:33.310 --> 01:03:35.800
which dominates US
civilian science

01:03:35.800 --> 01:03:38.235
and the major scientific
organizations that

01:03:38.235 --> 01:03:38.860
are part of it.

01:03:38.860 --> 01:03:41.920
So NIH, NSF, DOE,
Office of Science

01:03:41.920 --> 01:03:46.030
are all organized on a
basic research model.

01:03:46.030 --> 01:03:52.070
But then there's a parallel
universe in the US R&D system.

01:03:52.070 --> 01:03:56.450
The Defense Innovation system is
not organized like that at all.

01:03:56.450 --> 01:03:58.550
It's back to World War II.

01:03:58.550 --> 01:04:00.410
It's a much more
connected system.

01:04:00.410 --> 01:04:02.390
So we're going to
explore that in class 6

01:04:02.390 --> 01:04:03.960
in a fair amount of depth.

01:04:03.960 --> 01:04:08.720
But the agencies
themselves have changed.

01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:10.260
They've evolved over time.

01:04:10.260 --> 01:04:18.400
So for example, at
NSF itself, which

01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:22.090
is the classic basic
research organization--

01:04:22.090 --> 01:04:24.660
NSF's probably greatest
director, Eric Bloch,

01:04:24.660 --> 01:04:27.280
who died tragically recently--

01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:28.840
great, great figure in science.

01:04:28.840 --> 01:04:34.580
He's the only NSF director
to come out of industry,

01:04:34.580 --> 01:04:40.160
so he was part of that amazing
IBM team that did a lot of--

01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:42.260
that won the president's
Medal of Technology

01:04:42.260 --> 01:04:46.940
for some of their really
early computing advances.

01:04:46.940 --> 01:04:49.020
So he comes out of the
computer science arena.

01:04:49.020 --> 01:04:50.900
And so he walks into NSF.

01:04:50.900 --> 01:04:54.110
He sees this basic
research agency.

01:04:54.110 --> 01:04:56.780
He sees that they all
seem to want computers,

01:04:56.780 --> 01:05:00.350
but they have no idea of
what computer science is.

01:05:00.350 --> 01:05:05.300
So he creates a whole new branch
of science, computer science,

01:05:05.300 --> 01:05:08.360
and builds a strong support
system for computer science

01:05:08.360 --> 01:05:10.143
organizations and departments.

01:05:10.143 --> 01:05:11.810
DARPA had previously
been funding those.

01:05:11.810 --> 01:05:15.120
Suddenly, NSF is landing
in that space, as well.

01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:18.530
In addition, he embraces
the engineering division.

01:05:18.530 --> 01:05:21.110
He himself is an
engineer from RPI.

01:05:21.110 --> 01:05:23.030
He embraces the
engineering division

01:05:23.030 --> 01:05:26.090
and brings in a whole set
of much more connected

01:05:26.090 --> 01:05:28.982
collaborative engineering
research centers

01:05:28.982 --> 01:05:30.440
and related programs
that are going

01:05:30.440 --> 01:05:34.400
to be much more connected into
the system than most of NSF is.

01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:37.640
So even these
agencies themselves

01:05:37.640 --> 01:05:41.570
tend to push further down
the innovation pipeline

01:05:41.570 --> 01:05:44.090
than just the early
stage research, even

01:05:44.090 --> 01:05:46.130
an organization like NSF.

01:05:46.130 --> 01:05:51.050
So there's an evolving
story here on how US science

01:05:51.050 --> 01:05:53.100
organizations is structured.

01:05:53.100 --> 01:05:55.670
And when you read an
article in the next class

01:05:55.670 --> 01:05:57.680
about new model
innovation agencies,

01:05:57.680 --> 01:06:00.045
we're going to confront
some of those issues.

01:06:00.045 --> 01:06:01.420
So in the next
class, we're going

01:06:01.420 --> 01:06:04.610
to talk about the parallel
Defense Innovation

01:06:04.610 --> 01:06:07.460
organization, which
is very connected,

01:06:07.460 --> 01:06:09.980
as well as the evolution of
these agencies themselves.

01:06:09.980 --> 01:06:13.340
So it's not as if
things have stood still.

01:06:13.340 --> 01:06:18.170
Stokes's critique has been
understood and accepted,

01:06:18.170 --> 01:06:20.780
in some ways, in some parts
of these other agencies,

01:06:20.780 --> 01:06:26.080
although they still remain
basic research-based.

01:06:26.080 --> 01:06:27.910
So it's an evolving
story here, Matthew.

01:06:31.070 --> 01:06:34.780
Sanam, how about one more
question-- or a couple more?

01:06:34.780 --> 01:06:39.430
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so getting
at the idea of short-term

01:06:39.430 --> 01:06:41.080
versus longer-term,
if we're looking

01:06:41.080 --> 01:06:44.560
at that top-right
quadrant where it's

01:06:44.560 --> 01:06:48.190
use-considered
basic research, do

01:06:48.190 --> 01:06:51.820
you think that that's
still a little-- there's

01:06:51.820 --> 01:06:54.400
a lot of emphasis on innovation
being centered there.

01:06:54.400 --> 01:06:57.130
Do you think that's
still focused on

01:06:57.130 --> 01:07:02.920
short to medium-term visions,
and excluding the longer-term,

01:07:02.920 --> 01:07:05.268
or do you think there's
also the space for more

01:07:05.268 --> 01:07:06.732
long-term approach?

01:07:14.070 --> 01:07:20.180
AUDIENCE: So I think just one
example [INAUDIBLE] like DARPA.

01:07:20.180 --> 01:07:25.130
Because I worked on a
project with exoskeletons.

01:07:25.130 --> 01:07:27.730
It was funded by
DARPA, and they--

01:07:27.730 --> 01:07:30.070
it was consideration-based.

01:07:30.070 --> 01:07:35.440
They were looking for the
next generation of soldiers.

01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:39.250
And the projects that
they were funding

01:07:39.250 --> 01:07:43.120
were super early stage,
down to [INAUDIBLE] basics

01:07:43.120 --> 01:07:46.615
of biomechanics, and energy
usage, and metabolics,

01:07:46.615 --> 01:07:49.940
biowalking, [INAUDIBLE].

01:07:49.940 --> 01:07:55.992
So I do think there are some
examples of a longer-term while

01:07:55.992 --> 01:07:58.123
still considering use.

01:07:58.123 --> 01:08:00.040
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I think
it's harder and harder

01:08:00.040 --> 01:08:03.580
to think of examples of
pure basic research now.

01:08:03.580 --> 01:08:05.830
Obviously, there are still some.

01:08:05.830 --> 01:08:07.930
Like astrophysics
research and understanding

01:08:07.930 --> 01:08:10.150
the universe might still
fall into that category.

01:08:10.150 --> 01:08:14.110
But I think a lot of
what people are doing,

01:08:14.110 --> 01:08:15.880
people have some
sort of idea of what

01:08:15.880 --> 01:08:17.020
an end goal might be in it.

01:08:17.020 --> 01:08:20.740
Like biotech
applications can go back

01:08:20.740 --> 01:08:22.353
to very basic bio research.

01:08:22.353 --> 01:08:23.770
And now people
doing that research

01:08:23.770 --> 01:08:26.350
are thinking about
how it might be

01:08:26.350 --> 01:08:28.210
able to be used in the future.

01:08:28.210 --> 01:08:31.690
So I think that is
definitely still long-term.

01:08:31.690 --> 01:08:33.700
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
Steph, I like your point.

01:08:33.700 --> 01:08:36.760
And an MIT scientist
once explained to me

01:08:36.760 --> 01:08:38.560
how it actually works.

01:08:38.560 --> 01:08:41.979
He said, look, on
day one, I'm doing

01:08:41.979 --> 01:08:43.600
fundamental exploratory science.

01:08:43.600 --> 01:08:46.600
And I may do that for a
considerable period of time.

01:08:46.600 --> 01:08:48.550
Then I see something.

01:08:48.550 --> 01:08:50.080
Then I see something.

01:08:50.080 --> 01:08:52.479
Some kind of
opportunity pattern.

01:08:52.479 --> 01:08:56.050
Suddenly, I'm doing applied
science, because something--

01:08:56.050 --> 01:08:56.920
I've seen something.

01:08:56.920 --> 01:08:58.720
I've seen what the
possibilities are.

01:08:58.720 --> 01:09:02.439
And then I'll play with that,
and then it doesn't work,

01:09:02.439 --> 01:09:05.859
so then I'm back doing
fundamental exploratory basic

01:09:05.859 --> 01:09:09.340
science again for a while.

01:09:09.340 --> 01:09:11.020
It's a dynamic process here.

01:09:11.020 --> 01:09:12.670
I think Stokes is right.

01:09:12.670 --> 01:09:15.160
It's not a static
linear process.

01:09:15.160 --> 01:09:16.990
And often, the
scientists themselves

01:09:16.990 --> 01:09:20.992
will move between basic
and later-stage work

01:09:20.992 --> 01:09:23.200
on a single research project,
based upon what they're

01:09:23.200 --> 01:09:26.319
discovering and finding.

01:09:26.319 --> 01:09:27.939
The National
Institutes of Health

01:09:27.939 --> 01:09:29.960
is pretty much a basic
research organization,

01:09:29.960 --> 01:09:32.402
but when you go to the
National Institutes of Health,

01:09:32.402 --> 01:09:33.819
you don't apply
to them for money.

01:09:33.819 --> 01:09:38.200
You apply to the National
Cancer Institute.

01:09:38.200 --> 01:09:42.340
So you're not applying to the
National Institute Let's Go

01:09:42.340 --> 01:09:44.170
Have Fun in the Laboratory.

01:09:44.170 --> 01:09:46.450
You're applying to the
National Cancer Institute.

01:09:46.450 --> 01:09:50.979
So there is some
use-inspired elements,

01:09:50.979 --> 01:09:54.510
even in a pretty basic
research organization like NIH.

01:10:02.520 --> 01:10:05.187
How about a closing
point, Sanam?

01:10:05.187 --> 01:10:05.770
AUDIENCE: Yes.

01:10:05.770 --> 01:10:08.440
AUDIENCE: Can I ask a
follow-up really quick?

01:10:08.440 --> 01:10:11.440
You mentioned that this has now
become sort of the seminal work

01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:13.665
in science technology policy.

01:10:13.665 --> 01:10:14.290
I was curious--

01:10:14.290 --> 01:10:15.100
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
That Stokes is?

01:10:15.100 --> 01:10:15.300
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:10:15.300 --> 01:10:16.910
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Yes, it is.

01:10:16.910 --> 01:10:17.500
AUDIENCE: I was
wondering if you could

01:10:17.500 --> 01:10:19.480
talk about the
immediate reception

01:10:19.480 --> 01:10:22.320
when he published it-- or when
it was published posthumously.

01:10:22.320 --> 01:10:23.320
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: War.

01:10:27.550 --> 01:10:30.050
A fundamental
ethos of scientists

01:10:30.050 --> 01:10:34.310
is we're doing basic fundamental
research, exploratory research.

01:10:34.310 --> 01:10:37.370
Data has enormous value.

01:10:37.370 --> 01:10:41.780
And here's Stokes telling us
that we're missing something.

01:10:41.780 --> 01:10:45.560
Shove it was a lot
of the reaction.

01:10:45.560 --> 01:10:48.290
Nobody quite said that, because
Stokes was dying of leukemia.

01:10:48.290 --> 01:10:52.280
But that was pretty
much the tenor.

01:10:52.280 --> 01:10:55.370
And that's still a
ongoing debate here.

01:10:55.370 --> 01:10:58.370
MIT, in some ways, is a
very unique institution,

01:10:58.370 --> 01:11:02.930
because at the beginning, at the
foundational moment in 1860s,

01:11:02.930 --> 01:11:05.240
it attempted to integrate
engineering and science.

01:11:05.240 --> 01:11:07.910
Remember we talked about
at the very beginning--

01:11:07.910 --> 01:11:12.910
engineering is
organized around--

01:11:12.910 --> 01:11:15.610
in the 19th century,
it was making stuff.

01:11:15.610 --> 01:11:16.750
It was doing things.

01:11:16.750 --> 01:11:18.760
That's what engineering
was all about.

01:11:18.760 --> 01:11:21.160
Science was natural philosophy.

01:11:21.160 --> 01:11:22.630
It was observational.

01:11:22.630 --> 01:11:26.230
It was understanding how
the natural world operates.

01:11:26.230 --> 01:11:29.170
MIT attempted to bring these
two fields together and put them

01:11:29.170 --> 01:11:30.730
on a continuum.

01:11:30.730 --> 01:11:34.780
So there may be a pure
natural scientist at MIT--

01:11:34.780 --> 01:11:38.800
and there are-- and there
may be some pure engineers,

01:11:38.800 --> 01:11:41.710
but mostly, they're all
on a continuum together.

01:11:41.710 --> 01:11:45.640
And the organizational mechanism
that MIT uses to do that

01:11:45.640 --> 01:11:47.980
is not the departments.

01:11:47.980 --> 01:11:50.493
So most universities
have the departments

01:11:50.493 --> 01:11:51.910
at their core,
which are organized

01:11:51.910 --> 01:11:54.130
around single scientific fields.

01:11:54.130 --> 01:11:55.660
Departments are
important at MIT,

01:11:55.660 --> 01:11:57.400
because they determine
credentialing,

01:11:57.400 --> 01:11:59.830
and do you have a job,
and can you teach,

01:11:59.830 --> 01:12:01.200
and what are you going to teach.

01:12:01.200 --> 01:12:02.500
They're important.

01:12:02.500 --> 01:12:06.970
But the really powerful
elements are the labs at MIT,

01:12:06.970 --> 01:12:09.310
and they integrate
all kinds of fields,

01:12:09.310 --> 01:12:11.920
and they are use-driven.

01:12:11.920 --> 01:12:14.290
They are very much
results-driven.

01:12:14.290 --> 01:12:16.660
So they're bringing together
science and engineering

01:12:16.660 --> 01:12:20.380
on a continuum, but with a
set of organized purposes.

01:12:20.380 --> 01:12:23.770
So it's a pretty unique
organizational model.

01:12:23.770 --> 01:12:27.610
It's not the pervasive
model in US universities.

01:12:27.610 --> 01:12:35.360
So this debate doesn't really
break out that much at MIT,

01:12:35.360 --> 01:12:38.270
because MIT already
did the integration.

01:12:38.270 --> 01:12:40.880
But at many other places,
it's an ongoing debate.

01:12:43.600 --> 01:12:45.190
So Sanam, a closing thought?

01:12:45.190 --> 01:12:48.325
I keep-- what do you think?

01:12:48.325 --> 01:12:49.700
AUDIENCE: Something
that's really

01:12:49.700 --> 01:12:51.075
in my mind,
especially right now,

01:12:51.075 --> 01:12:53.663
is just the direction that this
debate is going to take on,

01:12:53.663 --> 01:12:56.080
especially considering you've
got to go through the budget

01:12:56.080 --> 01:12:56.705
and everything.

01:12:56.705 --> 01:12:59.760
So I think that means a
lot for a lot of areas

01:12:59.760 --> 01:13:02.170
that are outside the reach
of market in general.

01:13:02.170 --> 01:13:05.860
And especially with
science funding,

01:13:05.860 --> 01:13:08.780
it seems like defense
is the clear winner

01:13:08.780 --> 01:13:11.170
with this new budget.

01:13:11.170 --> 01:13:13.530
So I think that
that kind of might

01:13:13.530 --> 01:13:15.768
signal a
re-prioritization that is

01:13:15.768 --> 01:13:17.560
going to have some
interesting implications

01:13:17.560 --> 01:13:18.823
for this whole debate.

01:13:18.823 --> 01:13:20.990
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: That's
a really important point.

01:13:20.990 --> 01:13:24.700
This is a pretty seminal moment
in US scientific history.

01:13:24.700 --> 01:13:28.000
So the organizational
set of assumptions

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:29.770
that the Vannevar
Bush put into place

01:13:29.770 --> 01:13:34.170
at the close of World War II of
federal support for research,

01:13:34.170 --> 01:13:35.290
it's really being--

01:13:35.290 --> 01:13:36.880
in question now.

01:13:36.880 --> 01:13:39.820
And this is the largest
cutback of a federal science

01:13:39.820 --> 01:13:43.090
support in history
that's now been proposed.

01:13:43.090 --> 01:13:45.490
Is the model ending?

01:13:45.490 --> 01:13:49.810
Is this amazing system of
federally-supported research

01:13:49.810 --> 01:13:53.770
universities-- is
that being phased out?

01:13:53.770 --> 01:13:56.680
So it's a very critical time
to consider these questions.

01:13:56.680 --> 01:13:58.490
This is the model that
we've had up to now.

01:13:58.490 --> 01:14:00.160
This is the first
time I've really

01:14:00.160 --> 01:14:06.310
seen a pretty fundamental
hit on that model.

01:14:06.310 --> 01:14:09.030
Now, whether Congress
takes it or not, we'll see.

01:14:09.030 --> 01:14:12.150
It's going to be playing
out in the next few months.

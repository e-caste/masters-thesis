WEBVTT

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:15.410
This will be Professor Cohen's kind of last
complete lecture, although, on the last day

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:22.390
of classes the plan is we're going to take
some of the time just to talk over what we've

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:24.930
done and review things.

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:31.560
And it will be really oriented towards general
aspects of systems engineering.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.090
And, Aaron, I will turn it over to you.

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.760
Thank you.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:43.760
Today, I'm going to lecture primarily on systems
engineering but management as it relates to

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:46.489
systems engineering.

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:50.030
I have several checks and balances.

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:55.199
And, of course, today I've got people from
the Draper Laboratories and people from the

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:01.780
predecessor to Draper Laboratories, MIT Instrumentation
Laboratory are going to check me to see if

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.349
I say the right thing.

00:01:04.349 --> 00:01:10.340
First of all, I would like to say to you as
a class that I read your last submission reports

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.470
and really thought they were outstanding.

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:19.099
They show a great deal of interest, a great
deal of understanding and a great deal of

00:01:19.099 --> 00:01:19.349
initiative.

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.789
And so, I really compliment you.

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:26.789
And I'm sure your final reports will be better,
but they really were very, very, very good.

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:34.780
You've heard a lot of people talk previously,
starting with, in my way of thinking, Dale

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:41.910
Myers who was sort of the person who started
the program in Washington at the time.

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:47.440
You didn't hear from another very important
man, George Miller, who was really Dale's

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.720
boss at the time.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.348
But George is still alive, is still doing
very well.

00:01:54.348 --> 00:01:55.789
And you didn't hear from a lot of other people.

00:01:55.789 --> 00:02:02.789
You did hear from Chris Kraft which sort of
set the tone, you might say, for a very interesting

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:09.220
and understanding man who really knows what
he's doing and says what he thinks.

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.950
But there are several other people that I
would like to talk about that had a great

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.550
bearing on my career in terms of systems engineering.

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:23.030
There were two people, both who have passed
away.

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.530
One is Joe Shea.

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.340
And Joe was a very remarkable engineer.

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:36.340
He was program manager of the Apollo Program
at the Johnson Space Center, then left and

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:44.870
became Vice President of Raytheon here and
then became a professor at MIT in the Aero-Astro

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:45.120
Department.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.890
And I thought he maybe taught the forerunner
to this course.

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.100
He taught systems engineering.

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:59.100
And Joe Shea was actually the best systems
engineer I've ever met, so I am going to talk

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.340
a little bit and give you some understanding
of my interaction with Joe.

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.640
The best job I ever had, you might say, really,
is I've had a lot of different jobs, but my

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:14.120
first job was really working with the MIT
Instrumentation Laboratory where I met a great

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.200
number of people.

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.860
I'm not going to mention everybody because
it would fill up the time.

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:25.660
They taught me systems engineering, but had
it not been for the MIT Instrumentation Laboratory

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:29.010
we wouldn't have gone to the Moon on the schedule
we went on.

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.780
They really did a fantastic job, all these
people.

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.670
I mean they were just you might say giants.

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:39.290
There were great people at Rockwell, at North
American Aviation such as George Jeffs and

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:46.290
great people at Grumman such as Joe Gavin
and other places, but I have to say that the

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:53.230
MIT Instrumentation Lab really carried the
ball on understanding how to do guidance,

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:54.880
navigation and control.

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:59.940
And if you read some of the comments by George
Low, who is the other person I am going to

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.900
talk about, George Low is another giant.

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:07.090
He says the most complicated system on the
Apollo spacecraft was the guidance navigation

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:08.390
system, if you read what he said.

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:15.310
And could you really hit a target 240,000
miles away and bring it back?

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:18.738
But let me get back to Joe Shea.

00:04:18.738 --> 00:04:22.029
I said he was a great systems engineer.

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:25.910
And Joe Shea taught me a couple of things.

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:29.790
One, he taught me not to be afraid to make
a decision.

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:36.430
He said the fact that you are in charge, the
fact that you have looked at all the information,

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:41.260
the fact that you know the details, you are
the best one to make a decision.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:48.260
And if you could make a timely decision and
your battering average is a little over 60%

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:50.850
you're doing very well.

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:56.350
But the fact you made it timely and the fact
that you understand it, you can make a change.

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:58.970
You can change if you are wrong.

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:01.710
And that always stuck with me, not to be afraid
to make a decision.

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:08.070
Because many times as you go through your
role in systems engineering you're not going

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:11.419
to have all the information to make a decision
on a timely basis.

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:17.810
It is just not going to be there, especially
if you do a program that pertains to advanced

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:21.590
technology, advanced research and development.

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:23.419
That is one thing that is important.

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:27.190
Another thing that Joe Shea brought to the
table.

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:32.960
During the Apollo Program, before we had Joe
Shea, we would sit around a conference table

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:39.210
in the early `60s trying to figure out what
systems engineering was, but we couldn't really

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:41.650
explain what we had to do.

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:44.010
We didn't know what we really had to do.

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:51.010
But when Joe Shea came, he brought with him
the insight of what you needed to do to do

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:55.010
systems engineering.

00:05:55.010 --> 00:06:01.320
Now, this is the Apollo stack as you see in
on the pad you might say.

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:03.090
The launch vehicles.

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:04.500
The launch vehicle.

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:06.949
The first stage, second stage.

00:06:06.949 --> 00:06:13.949
Then you get to the lunar module, the command
and service module, launch escape tower.

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:17.330
That is what it looks like on the pad.

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:23.300
Well, Joe Shea gave me probably the toughest
job and one of the most important jobs that

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:26.030
I had in my career.

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:33.030
He said, Aaron, you are going to be in charge
of resolving all the ICDs, the interface control

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:33.720
documents.

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:39.290
That is all the interfaces between all the
stages, between the command and service module

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:44.130
and the lunar module, between the command
and service module, lunar module and the stack,

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:47.790
between the command and service module, lunar
module and the launch complex.

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:52.330
There were about a thousand ICDs involved
in that.

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:59.330
And that was a formidable task because an
interface control document you cannot design

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:04.009
without the interfaces being defined, and
you cannot define the interfaces without the

00:07:04.009 --> 00:07:05.020
design.

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:08.150
So it is really a chicken and the egg type
of thing.

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:11.550
And it turns out that was a turning point
in my career because we did do that.

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:16.490
In fact, a little sideline, a little interesting
story.

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:20.070
He anointed me to do this job but didn't just
leave me there.

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:24.800
He took me to the contractors, he took me
to the MIT Instrumentation Lab, he took me

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:29.820
to Rockwell, he took me to Grumman and he
took me to the Marshall Space Flight Center

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:32.370
and Kennedy Space Center.

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:36.210
And the funny part about it, he took me in
to see von Braun, which I didn't know about.

00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:38.620
I didn't know von Braun.

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:41.750
And he said, Wernher, this is Aaron Cohen.

00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:44.699
We were in his big office at Marshall.

00:07:44.699 --> 00:07:48.680
He said he is going to resolve all the ICDs,
all the interface control documents.

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:50.770
And Wernher von Braun said that is wonderful.

00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:52.100
What is an ICD?

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:58.600
So I knew I had a problem there right away
that the head charge of Marshall didn't know

00:07:58.600 --> 00:07:59.650
what an ICD was.

00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:02.699
But that was a little bit of a sideline on
it.

00:08:02.699 --> 00:08:08.580
I did have the job to actually resolve all
the interface control documents.

00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:14.270
And that turned out to be one of my most interesting,
most challenging jobs as a young engineer.

00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:19.639
It really taught me systems engineering, because
one of the important parts of system engineering

00:08:19.639 --> 00:08:23.310
is understanding where the interfaces are
and how you get the interfaces resolved.

00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:29.380
And you could imagine trying to get Grumman
at that time at North American Aviation and

00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:33.539
MIT Instrumental Labs to agree on an interface
document.

00:08:33.539 --> 00:08:37.130
I mean it wasn't the easiest thing in the
world to do.

00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:37.380
Yes.
Did you have a question?

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:43.259
I was just wondering, aside from technically
making sure that the interfaces are working

00:08:43.259 --> 00:08:47.509
and everything, what is involved in resolving
an ICD?

00:08:47.509 --> 00:08:49.410
That's a good question.

00:08:49.410 --> 00:08:52.429
Well, first of all, I am going to talk a little
bit more about ICDs in general.

00:08:52.429 --> 00:08:55.300
ICDs you can define in several categories.

00:08:55.300 --> 00:09:01.800
One is mechanical or physical ICDs, bolt hold
patterns, just how things bolt together.

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:07.569
The other, you might say, is electrical ICDs,
what kind of electrical signals are sent and

00:09:07.569 --> 00:09:09.490
electrical interfaces.

00:09:09.490 --> 00:09:12.449
And the other are functional ICDs.

00:09:12.449 --> 00:09:19.449
One of the big ICDs we had to resolve was
a term called Guidance Reference Release.

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:24.790
Marshal had an inertial measurement unit in
their instrument unit, and we had to have

00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:30.610
that synchronized with our system or with
the system in the command and service module.

00:09:30.610 --> 00:09:34.110
What is involved in it is you sit down and
you talk.

00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:36.819
You have a draft ICD.

00:09:36.819 --> 00:09:37.959
And we had these big meetings.

00:09:37.959 --> 00:09:41.309
We had them at the Kennedy Space Center.

00:09:41.309 --> 00:09:44.490
I don't know if you've ever been to the Kennedy
Space Center, but we actually fill the firing

00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:46.730
room with people.

00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:52.269
And each group had a certain set of draft
ICDs, and they would sit down in working groups

00:09:52.269 --> 00:09:59.269
and decide what had to be done to get the
interface compatible in terms of the three

00:09:59.279 --> 00:10:05.689
phases Physical, electrical and functional.

00:10:05.689 --> 00:10:06.769
And you just work out the details.

00:10:06.769 --> 00:10:11.019
Aaron, probably now in the 21st century, we
ought to add data ICDs.

00:10:11.019 --> 00:10:11.949
Data ICDs, yeah.

00:10:11.949 --> 00:10:16.319
Well, now things have changed probably a lot
since I've been involved in it.

00:10:16.319 --> 00:10:17.949
I mean remember Mars Polar Lander.

00:10:17.949 --> 00:10:19.749
We had English units coming over.

00:10:19.749 --> 00:10:20.319
Yeah, that's right.

00:10:20.319 --> 00:10:23.100
And the people thought they were getting metric
units.

00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:23.980
So the data ICDs are also critical.

00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:29.100
You know, and a lot of things are very simple
and mundane.

00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:30.579
I could tell you a story with the crew.

00:10:30.579 --> 00:10:34.319
When we said you're going to have in-flight
maintenance with the crew.

00:10:34.319 --> 00:10:41.319
And we gave the crew to change out a component,
but instead of taking the screw out very easily,

00:10:42.779 --> 00:10:47.970
we had actually put Loctite in the screw so
we couldn't undo the screw.

00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:51.629
There are very simple interfaces that have
to be resolved.

00:10:51.629 --> 00:10:53.540
Some are mundane, some are very sophisticated.

00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:55.410
I don't know if that answers your question.

00:10:55.410 --> 00:10:57.540
The problem is there is no F=ma.

00:10:57.540 --> 00:11:02.689
There is no closed form solution that tells
you exactly how to do it.

00:11:02.689 --> 00:11:08.709
You just have to sit down and work it because
the design hasn't been complete but you have

00:11:08.709 --> 00:11:09.319
ideas.

00:11:09.319 --> 00:11:13.179
You float ideas, you negotiate, you arbitrate
and then you come up with a decision.

00:11:13.179 --> 00:11:17.550
The main thing is you've got to make a decision,
and somebody has to be there to make a decision.

00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:22.999
That was my job, to make a decision.

00:11:22.999 --> 00:11:29.079
That was what Joe Shea left me with.

00:11:29.079 --> 00:11:36.079
And people that know him will agree that he
was an outstanding engineer but also probably

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:40.550
one of the best systems engineers.

00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:45.920
Larry, do you know what course Joe taught
when he was here?

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:47.939
Yes, systems engineering.

00:11:47.939 --> 00:11:50.619
He taught this course?

00:11:50.619 --> 00:11:51.300
Yes.

00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:56.759
I thought he taught this course because I
know I came up and gave a lecture for him.

00:11:56.759 --> 00:11:59.259
Until he was taken ill.

00:11:59.259 --> 00:12:06.259
Let me talk about another person that was
very prominent in informing my career.

00:12:08.649 --> 00:12:10.429
His name was George Low.

00:12:10.429 --> 00:12:17.429
After Joe retired, George Low became the Apollo
Program Manager at the Johnson Space Center.

00:12:20.549 --> 00:12:23.949
And George was very much a disciplinarian.

00:12:23.949 --> 00:12:27.279
He always had time to see you.

00:12:27.279 --> 00:12:31.809
But there were several criteria in seeing
you.

00:12:31.809 --> 00:12:38.809
You had to tell him what your subject was,
how long he wanted and why you wanted to see

00:12:41.929 --> 00:12:42.509
him.

00:12:42.509 --> 00:12:46.600
So when you met with him, if you asked for
15 minutes, you had 15 minutes.

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:50.509
And no matter how important the job was, if
you didn't finish was you had to say in 15

00:12:50.509 --> 00:12:52.559
minutes you were out the door.

00:12:52.559 --> 00:12:55.259
And you only did that once.

00:12:55.259 --> 00:12:59.110
But you didn't ask for too much time either
because you got penalized if you said you

00:12:59.110 --> 00:13:00.850
needed an hour and you only took 30 minutes.

00:13:00.850 --> 00:13:05.759
So, he was very much a disciplinarian.

00:13:05.759 --> 00:13:11.059
He actually, after he retired from NASA, after
he retired from the Apollo Program became

00:13:11.059 --> 00:13:17.589
Deputy Administrator at NASA and was very
instrumental in the Shuttle Program and then

00:13:17.589 --> 00:13:20.480
retired and became president of Rensselaer
Polytechnic Institute.

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:22.670
So, George had a very illustrious career.

00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:25.649
He passed away several years ago.

00:13:25.649 --> 00:13:31.139
One incident might be of interest to you,
and I recall it very vividly.

00:13:31.139 --> 00:13:38.139
I don't know if everybody else does, but we
were getting ready to go to the Moon on Apollo

00:13:40.179 --> 00:13:40.429
11.

00:13:40.259 --> 00:13:40.610
This is on Apollo.

00:13:40.610 --> 00:13:44.980
And you monitor all the systems very carefully.

00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:51.589
And we were monitoring the inertial measurement
unit in the lunar module which is right here.

00:13:51.589 --> 00:13:57.079
And for some reason or other the drift rate
changed fairly drastically.

00:13:57.079 --> 00:14:00.040
Now, it was still in spec.

00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:04.929
The drift rate was still in spec but it changed.

00:14:04.929 --> 00:14:09.989
And to get to the lunar module and change
out an inertial measurement unit on the pad

00:14:09.989 --> 00:14:10.929
is pretty hard to do.

00:14:10.929 --> 00:14:13.600
First of all, the lunar module has very little
structure to it.

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:15.509
It is made out of Reynolds Wrap really.

00:14:15.509 --> 00:14:18.470
I mean it doesn't have very much structure
to it.

00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:25.470
And so we reviewed it with all the people
involved, reviewed the data and we concluded

00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:29.179
very clearly that there was nothing wrong
with it.

00:14:29.179 --> 00:14:36.179
And so we went to George Low and we told him
a unified story, the MIT people, the MIT Instrumentation

00:14:38.559 --> 00:14:41.939
people, the Rockwell people, everybody, the
JSC people.

00:14:41.939 --> 00:14:48.359
And George Low listened very attentively and
then said can you explain why it changed?

00:14:48.359 --> 00:14:52.420
And we said no, we're going to change it out.

00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:58.189
That is the thing that always stuck in my
mind.

00:14:58.189 --> 00:15:03.859
If there is something that you don't understand
then you need to take some action to fix it.

00:15:03.859 --> 00:15:09.489
And to me that was a very important part of
my learning process.

00:15:09.489 --> 00:15:16.489
And so, those were the people you might say
that really had an effect on my systems engineering

00:15:20.299 --> 00:15:22.199
thought process.

00:15:22.199 --> 00:15:28.040
The other thing I want to talk about with
you today is you heard a lot of people talk

00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:32.889
that I would class as subsystem managers.

00:15:32.889 --> 00:15:35.329
You heard Tom Moser talk about structures.

00:15:35.329 --> 00:15:36.230
I don't know if I can recall them all.

00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:40.299
Al Louviere talk about the mechanical systems.

00:15:40.299 --> 00:15:47.299
You heard Bob Ried talk about aerothermodynamics,
Bass Redd about aerodynamics, Henry Pohl about

00:15:47.449 --> 00:15:53.249
reaction control systems, auxiliary power
units and hydraulics, Walt Guy about environmental

00:15:53.249 --> 00:15:54.269
control systems.

00:15:54.269 --> 00:15:55.619
You heard of these people.

00:15:55.619 --> 00:16:02.619
These people are what I call subsystem managers
that actually, in some regards, work for me

00:16:02.829 --> 00:16:05.519
and, in some regards, didn't work for me.

00:16:05.519 --> 00:16:08.439
And that is what you call a matrix management
system.

00:16:08.439 --> 00:16:10.739
Now, I'm going to talk about matrix management.

00:16:10.739 --> 00:16:16.629
Matrix management was actually a very popular
management system several years ago.

00:16:16.629 --> 00:16:22.220
I don't know if it is used today or not, but
matrix management is a type of management

00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:25.899
basically used by large organizations.

00:16:25.899 --> 00:16:31.989
Primarily what it is are large projects organized
with teams that work on a functional rather

00:16:31.989 --> 00:16:36.730
than a project basis.

00:16:36.730 --> 00:16:41.369
In other words, these people I just talked
about actually had two bosses.

00:16:41.369 --> 00:16:48.369
They had a boss in their engineering organization,
a very famous man named Max Faget.

00:16:49.470 --> 00:16:52.619
And then they had another boss, which was
so famous, me.

00:16:52.619 --> 00:16:58.660
And I was their boss that controlled the project's
cost schedule and performance.

00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:01.040
And they actually reported to me on that.

00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:03.230
But they actually had two bosses.

00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:06.089
And so, you do that for several reasons.

00:17:06.089 --> 00:17:08.799
You do that in order to conserve resources.

00:17:08.799 --> 00:17:12.690
And many large companies do that.

00:17:12.690 --> 00:17:19.050
The other way of doing it, actually, would
be to put all that engineering talent in the

00:17:19.050 --> 00:17:20.640
project office.

00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:22.270
And you could see the advantages and disadvantages.

00:17:22.270 --> 00:17:25.930
I will show you more explicitly the advantages
and disadvantages on that.

00:17:25.930 --> 00:17:29.940
The advantages are that you have a dedicated
organization.

00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:33.860
The disadvantages are that when the project
is over there is no place for these people

00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:34.920
to go.

00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:37.550
And I don't know what you use.

00:17:37.550 --> 00:17:40.730
You have a matrix at the Draper Labs today.

00:17:40.730 --> 00:17:42.410
I'm not that close to industry.

00:17:42.410 --> 00:17:43.550
Do most companies use matrix today?

00:17:43.550 --> 00:17:43.940
Yes, most aerospace companies.

00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:50.940
There are too many projects that change all
the time and somebody has to be responsible

00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:56.240
for the people.

00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:58.730
See, that's an interesting part.

00:17:58.730 --> 00:18:01.460
We, at the Johnson Space Center, didn't have
that many projects.

00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:05.890
We only had really maybe one or two projects,
but we still used matrix management because

00:18:05.890 --> 00:18:10.460
there is a check and balance on matrix management
which you don't get on centralized or project

00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:10.710
management.

00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:12.530
There is advantage to it.

00:18:12.530 --> 00:18:14.320
There are some disadvantages to it.

00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:18.900
His rotation lab was project-oriented at the
time when we did Apollo.

00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:23.770
You were project-oriented because you had
one project and you were just project-oriented

00:18:23.770 --> 00:18:24.890
all NASA project.

00:18:24.890 --> 00:18:27.140
So, there are advantages and disadvantages.

00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:34.140
I had some dealings with Ford Motor Company,
and I think Ford Motor Company actually uses

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:35.120
matrix management.

00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:39.740
I think most large companies use matrix management
today.

00:18:39.740 --> 00:18:45.060
Anyway, that's really the advantages and disadvantages
of matrix management.

00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:50.530
And a lot of things I have already said.

00:18:50.530 --> 00:18:57.390
Under matrix management, all the people who
do one type of work are in a pool.

00:18:57.390 --> 00:19:03.280
For example, all the engineers in one engineering
department report to an engineering manager.

00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:04.310
That is what I said.

00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:05.890
They all report to an engineering manager.

00:19:05.890 --> 00:19:07.570
In this case, the name was Max Faget.

00:19:07.570 --> 00:19:12.230
And if you do history in the Space Program,
Max Faget becomes a very prominent name.

00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:19.230
He was really, you might say, the original
designer of the Mercury, Gemini and a lot

00:19:19.870 --> 00:19:22.690
to the Apollo spacecraft configuration.

00:19:22.690 --> 00:19:25.090
So, you will run into his name time and time
again.

00:19:25.090 --> 00:19:32.090
But, the interesting part about it is that
Max and I used to go at it tooth and nail.

00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:36.620
I mean his people would want to do something
like a Walt Guy.

00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:41.200
Walt at that time was a very stubborn person.

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:44.340
And he would want to do something and I wouldn't
want to do it.

00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:46.560
Well, he would go to Max.

00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:51.120
And then Max and I and Walt would have a meeting
at the Summit with Chris Kraft.

00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:52.550
It was a common point.

00:19:52.550 --> 00:19:55.180
We all went to see Chris Kraft.

00:19:55.180 --> 00:19:59.780
Sometimes I won and sometimes I lost, but
I learned actually to love it.

00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:04.050
Even though it frustrated me, I learned to
love it because there was that check and balance

00:20:04.050 --> 00:20:08.610
on me that I could not do something that was
going to actually be wrong.

00:20:08.610 --> 00:20:11.350
Somebody else was going to catch me if I did
something wrong.

00:20:11.350 --> 00:20:17.160
Now, I honestly do not know today what NASA
uses, whether they use matrix management on

00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:21.350
the Shuttle program or on the Space Station
program or how they are going to do it.

00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:23.110
Do you have any idea?

00:20:23.110 --> 00:20:27.240
The Shuttle was certainly much more project-oriented.

00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:32.560
We don't have the same, I mean there is an
engineering division at JSC, but during the

00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:36.410
Shuttle that was -- It started out matrix
management.

00:20:36.410 --> 00:20:42.710
I think it really decreased, and there was
no more Max Faget running things in that same

00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:43.100
way.

00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:49.500
And so that, in my mind, at least in my way
of thinking, is probably one reason why problems

00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:54.200
occurs, because you don't have that independent
check and balance.

00:20:54.200 --> 00:21:00.810
There is a very good reason why matrix management,
I think, is important, even though you don't

00:21:00.810 --> 00:21:07.810
have a number of projects that would cause
you to do matrix management.

00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:13.490
Well, this says these same engineers may be
assigned to different projects and report

00:21:13.490 --> 00:21:16.110
to a project manager while working on that
project.

00:21:16.110 --> 00:21:20.510
Therefore, each engineer may have to work
under several managers to get his or her job

00:21:20.510 --> 00:21:20.760
done.

00:21:20.610 --> 00:21:21.680
And that is what I was saying.

00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:28.680
It just turns out that you do have that type
of problem in doing that.

00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:34.260
Proponents suggest there are two advantages
to matrix management.

00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:38.110
First, it allows team members to share information
more readily across task boundaries.

00:21:38.110 --> 00:21:43.550
Second, it allows for a specialization that
can increase the depth of knowledge.

00:21:43.550 --> 00:21:48.590
You can see how, if you have a matrix manager,
you can call on more resources to go back

00:21:48.590 --> 00:21:54.990
to your home organization facilities in terms
of testing.

00:21:54.990 --> 00:22:00.650
I have worked under, and when I was in industry,
total project organizations.

00:22:00.650 --> 00:22:04.010
And it has a lot of advantages and disadvantages
also.

00:22:04.010 --> 00:22:10.230
The disadvantage of matrix management is that
employees can be confused due to conflicting

00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:10.680
loyalties.

00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:15.550
I mean was Walt Guy loyal to Max Faget or
was he loyal to Aaron Cohen?

00:22:15.550 --> 00:22:22.550
Now, Max actually gave him in raises but
I controlled the dollars for the project.

00:22:30.930 --> 00:22:33.190
But, you're right, that is what counts.

00:22:33.190 --> 00:22:34.130
They call that pink ticket.

00:22:34.130 --> 00:22:37.870
He was actually pink ticketed to Max and actually
worked for me.

00:22:37.870 --> 00:22:44.870
And I had to use all my persuasion to get
him to do the type of job.

00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:55.550
Properly management cooperative environment,
however, can neutralize these disadvantages.

00:22:55.550 --> 00:22:59.360
In Apollo there was one program.

00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:00.100
Right.

00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:01.580
[AUDIENCE QUESTION]

00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:08.220
For example, we had Air Force, Navy and NASA.

00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:08.960
Right.

00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:15.040
And we were doing accuracy evaluation for
each one.

00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:20.250
And we were developing the whole software
from scratch for each one.

00:23:20.250 --> 00:23:24.870
It was different language and different computers
and you couldn't compare results.

00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:25.400
Right.

00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:31.530
And when you have one engineering organization
that does the same at least you can compare.

00:23:31.530 --> 00:23:33.330
You have the check and balance.

00:23:33.330 --> 00:23:33.750
Right.

00:23:33.750 --> 00:23:35.600
That's a very good point.

00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:36.000
Yes, Jerry.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:36.390
[AUDIENCE QUESTION]

00:23:36.390 --> 00:23:43.100
Whether you a project organization, you had
your thumb on the people who had to produce.

00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:50.040
In the matrix organization, off times the
engineering manager would shuffle his man

00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:53.260
right out from under you to another project.

00:23:53.260 --> 00:23:55.630
Oh, that's right.

00:23:55.630 --> 00:23:57.880
That's what I had to contend with.

00:23:57.880 --> 00:24:04.880
On the other hand, my strong personality and
my good will kept it from going that way.

00:24:05.010 --> 00:24:10.050
And there was a certain amount of esprit de
corps that they wanted to get the job done.

00:24:10.050 --> 00:24:14.010
In the end it is the people.

00:24:14.010 --> 00:24:15.400
It's the people.

00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:17.370
It doesn't matter what organization.

00:24:17.370 --> 00:24:17.980
That's right.

00:24:17.980 --> 00:24:22.770
If the people are wrong, no organization is
going to work.

00:24:22.770 --> 00:24:23.270
Well, that's absolutely right.

00:24:23.270 --> 00:24:23.730
You have to have the right people.

00:24:23.730 --> 00:24:27.620
Well, that's why I brought some of these people
to talk to these students because these people

00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:29.310
were the people I worked with.

00:24:29.310 --> 00:24:31.710
Even though we argued at times.

00:24:31.710 --> 00:24:38.500
There was nobody that argued more than Henry
Pohl and I did, but he is usually always right.

00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:44.660
But you can learn to live with it.

00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:48.650
Matrix management can put some difficult on
the project managers because they must work

00:24:48.650 --> 00:24:52.160
closely with other managers and workers in
order to complete the project.

00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:54.900
The functional mangers may have different
goals and objectives.

00:24:54.900 --> 00:25:00.640
I was saying this as I present these charts,
but I think you can visualize that.

00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:03.790
And don't hesitate to ask questions because
you've got a lot of people here in the room

00:25:03.790 --> 00:25:06.410
today that can help answer these questions.

00:25:06.410 --> 00:25:06.900
Yes.

00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:09.810
The point about checking and balance.

00:25:09.810 --> 00:25:11.750
You have several managers.

00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:12.230
Yes.

00:25:12.230 --> 00:25:19.230
From my understanding, you have maybe a functional
manager and then you have [OVERLAPPING VOICES].

00:25:19.510 --> 00:25:22.110
Well, let me tell you what I mean by check
and balance.

00:25:22.110 --> 00:25:25.330
Let me give you a specific example.

00:25:25.330 --> 00:25:30.760
Let's say Henry Pohl on the reaction control
system wanted to do more testing or wanted

00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:33.330
to do more stability testing.

00:25:33.330 --> 00:25:38.110
And I looked at my budget and I looked at
where we stood in the schedule, and I said

00:25:38.110 --> 00:25:41.390
we just cannot afford that, we're just not
going to do that.

00:25:41.390 --> 00:25:42.990
I made an arbitrary decision.

00:25:42.990 --> 00:25:49.990
Well, Henry would be very upset about that
and he would go to Max, his functional manager.

00:25:50.620 --> 00:25:54.510
And Max would say boy, you're right, Aaron
is crazy.

00:25:54.510 --> 00:26:01.230
He would then call a meeting with Chris Kraft
between Henry, Max and myself to decide what

00:26:01.230 --> 00:26:02.310
we were going to do.

00:26:02.310 --> 00:26:04.400
And then Chris was the final word, the man
you met.

00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:05.970
He's a pretty strong guy.

00:26:05.970 --> 00:26:11.610
And if he agreed with Max, if Max had a convincing
story, he would turn me around and then we

00:26:11.610 --> 00:26:12.480
would do the testing.

00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:14.470
And I would just have to find the money some
place.

00:26:14.470 --> 00:26:21.470
But if I could convince Chris that Max was
overdoing it then I would win.

00:26:22.530 --> 00:26:22.780
And normally I lost, but that is OK.

00:26:22.630 --> 00:26:29.120
Do the engineers in any of these organizations
out of matrix management feel that they have

00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:30.690
too many managers?

00:26:30.690 --> 00:26:33.820
Well, it is frustrating to them a little bit.

00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:34.780
Yes, they did.

00:26:34.780 --> 00:26:40.090
It's frustrating because they had to feel
that they were working for two different people.

00:26:40.090 --> 00:26:44.170
And it is a little bit confusing to them.

00:26:44.170 --> 00:26:45.910
I mean they had two loyalties.

00:26:45.910 --> 00:26:47.360
That's what I pointed out.

00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:49.310
They essentially had two different loyalties.

00:26:49.310 --> 00:26:55.650
One to their functional manager who paid their
salaries and the other to me who really had

00:26:55.650 --> 00:26:59.210
the money for the project and the schedule.

00:26:59.210 --> 00:27:02.070
So, yes, it is a very tough thing to do.

00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:07.530
But, as you could tell, by talking to these
people that experienced it both in Apollo

00:27:07.530 --> 00:27:12.610
and in the early days of Shuttle, they were
very satisfied with the results.

00:27:12.610 --> 00:27:19.610
That is why it is very frustrating to some
of us to see the way things are going because

00:27:22.250 --> 00:27:27.860
we carried over most of these people you talked
to or are here in the room today worked on

00:27:27.860 --> 00:27:32.590
Apollo and then went and worked on Shuttle.

00:27:32.590 --> 00:27:34.830
We had the same process.

00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:41.830
We had the same Joe Shea, George Low process
that we did.

00:27:53.580 --> 00:27:56.550
Yes.

00:27:56.550 --> 00:28:02.490
[AUDIENCE QUESTION]

00:28:02.490 --> 00:28:09.490
Well, that's absolutely true.

00:28:14.380 --> 00:28:19.940
Your decision-making process in matrix management
turns out to be a little bit more cumbersome

00:28:19.940 --> 00:28:23.320
than if you have direct control.

00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:28.800
In other words, if you have your thumb on
everybody you can get a decision pretty quickly.

00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:35.700
On the other hand, you can violate some good
checks and balances so you give up the process

00:28:35.700 --> 00:28:41.250
of a rapid decision-making process versus
having some good checks and balances.

00:28:41.250 --> 00:28:46.400
Does that answer your thoughts?

00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:46.650
OK.

00:28:46.620 --> 00:28:48.430
I am going to leave that subject, unless there
are any other questions on it.

00:28:48.430 --> 00:28:50.480
Can I just bring up something?

00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:50.830
Sure.

00:28:50.830 --> 00:28:54.250
And I welcome your opinion on this, Elliot.

00:28:54.250 --> 00:29:01.000
And that is there has been a big change in
NASA recently which is affecting management.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:07.340
And that is because NASA has gone over to
what they call full cost accounting which

00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:14.340
means that during all of this time the engineering
organization maintained their engineers.

00:29:14.670 --> 00:29:15.880
That's true.

00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:22.309
They paid the salary and then they would be
assigned to projects as required.

00:29:22.309 --> 00:29:29.309
The system, as it's now working, is it's supposed
to be much more like in industry where the

00:29:29.610 --> 00:29:33.870
time of every engineer has to be billed to
a specific project.

00:29:33.870 --> 00:29:40.770
And if you don't have a project to bill your
time to, ultimately you become redundant.

00:29:40.770 --> 00:29:47.640
And so, those of you who read Aviation Week
and Space News, I hope all of you do, are

00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:52.640
aware that NASA is doing a lot of downsizing.

00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:54.820
It puts a lot of constraint on management.

00:29:54.820 --> 00:30:00.770
Now, in industry, obviously people have to
be paid for.

00:30:00.770 --> 00:30:06.780
But are there always enough projects to bill
people to?

00:30:06.780 --> 00:30:13.780
Well, there is never a situation that you
have the exact number of people.

00:30:26.180 --> 00:30:33.180
You're either short of many people, which
is now the situtation at Draper, or you don't

00:30:56.270 --> 00:31:03.270
have enough money.

00:31:04.390 --> 00:31:09.040
What you do, in a place like Draper, we have
our own money.

00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:09.740
It's called internal research.

00:31:09.740 --> 00:31:10.980
And we use some money [NOISE OBSCURES]

00:31:10.980 --> 00:31:11.860
and we keep those people.

00:31:11.860 --> 00:31:14.510
But those have to be people the company believes
can be used in the future.

00:31:14.510 --> 00:31:16.270
There is no point in keeping people that nobody
wants.

00:31:16.270 --> 00:31:19.610
Actually, the matrix system, and I talked
about it with Jerry because we are doing the

00:31:19.610 --> 00:31:22.330
evaluation, that is why I have to leave, is
really sorting the people out.

00:31:22.330 --> 00:31:23.350
Because when it was a big project, it was
a big family.

00:31:23.350 --> 00:31:23.600
The guy owned them.

00:31:23.559 --> 00:31:23.809
He knows them.

00:31:23.710 --> 00:31:23.960
That's true.

00:31:23.809 --> 00:31:24.950
Now, you work at the function organization
and we send you to work, he wants the best

00:31:24.950 --> 00:31:25.300
people for his project.

00:31:25.300 --> 00:31:25.740
He will say well, I don't want this guy.

00:31:25.740 --> 00:31:27.470
Now, if it is a mediocre guy, we will say
look, you cannot have the best.

00:31:27.470 --> 00:31:28.940
But if it is somebody who is very weak we
will say for one time, OK, maybe he didn't

00:31:28.940 --> 00:31:30.550
get along with the program so put him in another
program.

00:31:30.550 --> 00:31:32.760
But if we get the feedback, it doesn't work
there, we know there is a problem.

00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:38.030
In that way we weeded out a lot of people
that, if you have the old system, probably

00:31:38.030 --> 00:31:41.040
will stay and make us less efficient.

00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:44.480
NASA will be more efficient now, I think.

00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:46.640
I think that is true.

00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:48.450
On the other hand, it causes a lot of pain.

00:31:48.450 --> 00:31:50.270
It is very difficult to let people go but
that is part of management.

00:31:50.270 --> 00:31:57.140
It's not just going to parties.

00:31:57.140 --> 00:31:59.429
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE]

00:31:59.429 --> 00:32:01.720
That's right.

00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:05.330
Yes, there is a question.

00:32:05.330 --> 00:32:11.160
I guess another angle on the "very tough to
let people go" I've noticed that it is extremely

00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:18.160
difficult from a bureaucratic standpoint to
let somebody go in government.

00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:26.420
And I'm just wondering with full cost accounting,
OK, you've decided it is time for this person

00:32:30.770 --> 00:32:33.000
to go, but there is just a lot of politics
and bureaucracy paperwork to go through to

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:33.429
get somebody out of the organization.

00:32:33.429 --> 00:32:35.540
There are civil service laws which have to
be complied with.

00:32:35.540 --> 00:32:36.070
It is difficult.

00:32:36.070 --> 00:32:38.780
And, I have to say, I agree with Elliot.

00:32:38.780 --> 00:32:44.490
In the long-run I think NASA will become more
efficient.

00:32:44.490 --> 00:32:48.100
Well, to answer your question, there are several
ways to let people go.

00:32:48.100 --> 00:32:50.590
One is if they've really done something bad.

00:32:50.590 --> 00:32:54.070
You have a board and you go through it and
you release them.

00:32:54.070 --> 00:33:00.900
The other is if you NASA has a downsizing,
which is called a RIF, reduce in force.

00:33:00.900 --> 00:33:04.040
Then you can arbitrarily let people go.

00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:09.040
I didn't mean to interrupt you, Jeff, but
those are two ways.

00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:16.040
I will just add the third way, which NASA
is also doing, is you can offer what they

00:33:16.309 --> 00:33:16.920
call buyouts.

00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:23.920
They offer up to $25,000 if you will take
early retirement, so a lot of people do that.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:32.240
And companies, not government, have a much
easier time.

00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:37.270
I don't know how Draper is, but companies
have a much easier time letting people go

00:33:37.270 --> 00:33:39.620
than other places.

00:33:39.620 --> 00:33:42.080
But that was about all I was going to say
on management.

00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:48.820
Now I'm going to get into, you might say,
the interesting land of systems engineering

00:33:48.820 --> 00:33:51.100
and talk about systems engineering a little
bit.

00:33:51.100 --> 00:33:54.150
My charts are sort of yellow because they
go way back.

00:33:54.150 --> 00:33:59.120
It turns out systems engineering has been
studied a long time a lot.

00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:06.120
And there are many aspects of systems engineering
that some people in the room may or may not

00:34:06.179 --> 00:34:06.910
agree with.

00:34:06.910 --> 00:34:13.909
I've had time to reflect a little bit from
my days at NASA in both Apollo and Shuttle

00:34:14.469 --> 00:34:17.399
and in Space Station.

00:34:17.399 --> 00:34:24.399
And I was, as I say, Director of the Johnson
Space Center, I was Deputy Administrator,

00:34:25.089 --> 00:34:31.960
Acting Deputy Administration under Goldin
for a year, and then I taught at A&M.

00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:37.668
And all that time I have had time to reflect
and I have had time to do some, you might

00:34:37.668 --> 00:34:42.219
say, research of what I thought systems engineering
was and how you explain it.

00:34:42.219 --> 00:34:42.480
I want to try to do that today.

00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:47.389
People in the room may or may not agree with
it but it is my thought process.

00:34:47.389 --> 00:34:54.389
And it turns out that much of this information
was gathered from studies done by the military,

00:34:54.659 --> 00:34:56.099
mil specs on systems engineering.

00:34:56.099 --> 00:35:00.470
They have spent an awful lot of money studying
systems engineering.

00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:05.160
And many of these charts are plagiarized,
you might say, from those studies and they

00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:07.140
look sort of like they are yellow.

00:35:07.140 --> 00:35:08.019
And they are.

00:35:08.019 --> 00:35:13.589
But let's start off with systems engineering
heritage.

00:35:13.589 --> 00:35:18.630
Systems engineering, as we pointed out, is
not new.

00:35:18.630 --> 00:35:22.579
The pyramids, you know, that was a real systems
engineering problem.

00:35:22.579 --> 00:35:25.160
I don't know how they did it but it was a
real systems engineering problem.

00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:27.099
I don't know if even Jim Nevins could do that.

00:35:27.099 --> 00:35:29.930
That was a tough job.

00:35:29.930 --> 00:35:32.680
Broadcasting service and standards.

00:35:32.680 --> 00:35:36.499
Now, most of the time when you talk to people
about systems engineering, in fact, I've done

00:35:36.499 --> 00:35:41.769
a lot of research on that, they talk about
systems engineering as operations research.

00:35:41.769 --> 00:35:44.739
Well, I don't think that can be further from
the truth of systems engineering.

00:35:44.739 --> 00:35:50.160
I think it is a tool maybe used in systems
engineering, but it is not really systems

00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:50.630
engineering.

00:35:50.630 --> 00:35:54.140
The RAND Corporation developed the systems
analysis.

00:35:54.140 --> 00:35:55.609
The Bell Labs telephone systems.

00:35:55.609 --> 00:35:57.190
That was, of course, where Joe Shea came from.

00:35:57.190 --> 00:36:01.460
Joe Shea came from the Bell Labs at the time.

00:36:01.460 --> 00:36:03.799
NASA military systems, and these are mil standards.

00:36:03.799 --> 00:36:06.109
And the Army.

00:36:06.109 --> 00:36:11.059
And then systems engineering management guide
for Belvoir Defense Systems Management College.

00:36:11.059 --> 00:36:16.849
There were a lot of studies done for systems
engineering.

00:36:16.849 --> 00:36:22.220
And we, in Apollo, were trying to do systems
engineering in the 1960s for Apollo, is when

00:36:22.220 --> 00:36:23.999
we tried to start to do it.

00:36:23.999 --> 00:36:30.999
By the way, these charts are not on the Web
but I will give these to Jeff and they will

00:36:43.859 --> 00:36:44.849
be on the Web.

00:36:44.849 --> 00:36:51.849
Trans-highlighting the need for increased
systems engineering, there is a need to manage

00:36:52.039 --> 00:36:58.890
the total picture in the area of increasing
system size and cost, but even a small project

00:36:58.890 --> 00:37:01.579
has systems engineering.

00:37:01.579 --> 00:37:08.579
If you can think of how you design a bicycle,
how you design an automobile, I mean these

00:37:10.390 --> 00:37:12.369
are very complex problems.

00:37:12.369 --> 00:37:13.079
They are not simple.

00:37:13.079 --> 00:37:17.470
They are really systems engineering problems.

00:37:17.470 --> 00:37:24.470
But the increasing technological growth and
specialization, increasing systems complexity,

00:37:25.529 --> 00:37:29.910
you know, the PC is a fantastic systems engineering
problem.

00:37:29.910 --> 00:37:36.910
And I guess Bill Gates saw the need for a
true systems engineering job and made a lot

00:37:36.999 --> 00:37:42.420
of money on it in terms of what he did understanding
systems engineering.

00:37:42.420 --> 00:37:46.460
Increasing sensitivity to environmental factors
and increasing costs of life cycle.

00:37:46.460 --> 00:37:52.410
All those things make the trend in systems
engineering important.

00:37:52.410 --> 00:37:59.410
And, as I look at your reports, wherever you
got it, I think you have a pretty good knowledge

00:38:03.410 --> 00:38:06.680
of what systems engineering is.

00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:11.269
So, I am not sure this lecture is going to
help you that much because I think you do

00:38:11.269 --> 00:38:13.710
look at it from a systems engineering standpoint.

00:38:13.710 --> 00:38:16.289
By the way, my last topic is going to be cost
analysis.

00:38:16.289 --> 00:38:20.819
I'm sure you're waiting to hear that because
cost analysis is very hard for you to come

00:38:20.819 --> 00:38:21.329
to grips with.

00:38:21.329 --> 00:38:27.799
And I am going to talk a little bit about
how you would go about doing a cost analysis

00:38:27.799 --> 00:38:30.549
which may not dot all the Is and cross all
the Ts for you.

00:38:30.549 --> 00:38:32.009
But I am going to try to do that.

00:38:32.009 --> 00:38:36.769
We're going to take a break at about 11:00
and then I will have some time to go through

00:38:36.769 --> 00:38:37.480
cost analysis.

00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:39.140
Well, what is systems engineering?

00:38:39.140 --> 00:38:39.749
I don't know.

00:38:39.749 --> 00:38:45.150
You may not agree with this, but systems engineering
is the application of scientific and engineering

00:38:45.150 --> 00:38:52.150
to transfer an operational need into a description
of system performance parameters and of systems

00:38:53.489 --> 00:38:56.960
configuration through an iterative process.

00:38:56.960 --> 00:38:58.809
Now, let me give you a needs statement.

00:38:58.809 --> 00:39:05.259
When President Kennedy said we are going to
send men to the Moon and return them safety

00:39:05.259 --> 00:39:08.289
within a decade that is a perfect needs statement.

00:39:08.289 --> 00:39:15.039
It doesn't tell you how to do it, he didn't
put a cost constraint on it, he did put a

00:39:15.039 --> 00:39:19.829
time constraint on it, and he told you what
you had to do but didn't tell you anything

00:39:19.829 --> 00:39:21.539
about how to do it.

00:39:21.539 --> 00:39:24.460
That is a very good needs statement.

00:39:24.460 --> 00:39:31.460
I don't know if he did that for that reason,
but he gave the public and NASA a very good

00:39:31.589 --> 00:39:32.890
needs statement.

00:39:32.890 --> 00:39:38.619
Now, our job was to transform an operational
need into a description of system performance

00:39:38.619 --> 00:39:41.319
parameters and the system configuration through
an iterative process.

00:39:41.319 --> 00:39:44.460
And that is an exercise left to the student.

00:39:44.460 --> 00:39:48.009
That is not easy to do, but that is really
what you need to do.

00:39:48.009 --> 00:39:52.269
Now, to integrate technical parameters and
insure capability of all interfaces, that

00:39:52.269 --> 00:39:53.999
is what I talked about.

00:39:53.999 --> 00:39:56.069
You talked about physical, functional and
program interfaces.

00:39:56.069 --> 00:40:00.999
They call them different things but basically
interfaces become a very important part of

00:40:00.999 --> 00:40:03.160
the systems engineering process.

00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:10.160
And the other factors into the total engineering
are to meet cost, schedule and technical performance.

00:40:10.170 --> 00:40:11.309
What is that?

00:40:11.309 --> 00:40:13.759
I think Professor Hoffman talked about that.

00:40:13.759 --> 00:40:15.769
That is the three-legged stool.

00:40:15.769 --> 00:40:18.359
It is schedule, performance and cost.

00:40:18.359 --> 00:40:21.349
It is a continuous tradeoff because you are
going to have a criteria.

00:40:21.349 --> 00:40:27.769
Whereas, President Kennedy didn't give us
a cost, he did give us a schedule and, to

00:40:27.769 --> 00:40:28.910
a certain extent, performance.

00:40:28.910 --> 00:40:31.089
But he didn't give us a cost.

00:40:31.089 --> 00:40:35.109
Now, as it turns out, cost always becomes
a factor.

00:40:35.109 --> 00:40:36.720
It always becomes a factor.

00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:43.720
But those were the things that really comprised,
you might say, in simple-minded terms systems

00:40:44.950 --> 00:40:45.979
engineering.

00:40:45.979 --> 00:40:48.279
I cannot emphasize those enough.

00:40:48.279 --> 00:40:53.579
Now, I don't know if that is how you visualize
systems engineering or how everybody in the

00:40:53.579 --> 00:40:59.460
room visualizes systems engineering but that
and the design process is really what systems

00:40:59.460 --> 00:41:00.940
engineering and design is all about.

00:41:00.940 --> 00:41:07.660
Now, whether we utilize that always in design
of our projects I cannot say.

00:41:07.660 --> 00:41:13.119
I think we could have done a better upfront
job in systems engineering on the Shuttle.

00:41:13.119 --> 00:41:14.599
I really think we could have.

00:41:14.599 --> 00:41:19.410
I see things we could have done differently
on the Shuttle today if we really practiced

00:41:19.410 --> 00:41:20.869
a true systems engineering process.

00:41:20.869 --> 00:41:26.690
It is very difficult to do because you can
stay in this systems engineering loop a long

00:41:26.690 --> 00:41:29.269
time and not get anything done.

00:41:29.269 --> 00:41:36.269
There is an old adage, if you never get out
of this loop, you could do something, do something

00:41:36.390 --> 00:41:41.200
and do something and never get anything done,
so you've got to be very careful with that.

00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:44.509
What is the role of systems engineering?

00:41:44.509 --> 00:41:51.509
Technical customer interface requirements
definition.

00:41:51.549 --> 00:41:56.880
Requirements definition sound very, very simple,
but requirements definition is probably one

00:41:56.880 --> 00:42:00.589
of the hardest things you have to do, is to
find out what the true requirements are.

00:42:00.589 --> 00:42:05.759
And, unfortunately, requirements do change
as a function of time as you go through the

00:42:05.759 --> 00:42:07.150
phase of the program.

00:42:07.150 --> 00:42:13.940
But requirements definition is very, very
difficult to do and very important to come

00:42:13.940 --> 00:42:14.940
to grips with.

00:42:14.940 --> 00:42:21.720
As JR Thompson talked to you, I don't know
if you recall JR's review of the Shuttle main

00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:22.559
engine, SSME.

00:42:22.559 --> 00:42:29.559
He said had they widened the throat a little
bit they would have reduced the complexity

00:42:30.479 --> 00:42:35.299
of the design and development of the main
engine.

00:42:35.299 --> 00:42:38.670
Made it much more reliable but you would give
up some performance.

00:42:38.670 --> 00:42:42.339
Now, why didn't we do that?

00:42:42.339 --> 00:42:46.410
Because there was a requirement to advance
technology.

00:42:46.410 --> 00:42:50.519
And I think JR made a very, very important
point there that those are things you need

00:42:50.519 --> 00:42:52.069
to look at early in the program.

00:42:52.069 --> 00:42:55.979
So, requirements definition are very important,
extremely important.

00:42:55.979 --> 00:42:59.400
And it is very difficult to get to the bottom
of it.

00:42:59.400 --> 00:43:04.579
Requirements definition is a task in itself.

00:43:04.579 --> 00:43:09.089
And then, of course, there is a requirements
management analysis and flow down audit.

00:43:09.089 --> 00:43:11.470
And then, again, you get interface management.

00:43:11.470 --> 00:43:15.289
Risk management is becoming a big item today.

00:43:15.289 --> 00:43:19.369
You heard Bob Siemens talk, and I didn't mention
Bob Siemens.

00:43:19.369 --> 00:43:26.369
He is another very, very important man in
this whole era of Apollo and down to Shuttle.

00:43:27.369 --> 00:43:31.420
His role cannot be stated too highly.

00:43:31.420 --> 00:43:34.489
He did a fantastic job.

00:43:34.489 --> 00:43:37.940
His risk management was very interesting.

00:43:37.940 --> 00:43:40.210
I heard him talk not too long ago.

00:43:40.210 --> 00:43:45.869
And he said that the risk management in terms
of cost and in terms of human life for the

00:43:45.869 --> 00:43:52.589
Apollo program was accepted, not only by the
executive branch, the legislative branch but

00:43:52.589 --> 00:43:53.920
the public.

00:43:53.920 --> 00:43:55.400
So, risk management needs to be accepted.

00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:58.420
And that is one thing that is very, very important.

00:43:58.420 --> 00:44:05.420
Understand what the risk management is in
terms of life, in terms of cost and in terms

00:44:05.950 --> 00:44:07.069
of what it is going to do for you.

00:44:07.069 --> 00:44:08.859
So, risk management is very important.

00:44:08.859 --> 00:44:13.309
And it is the function of the systems engineer
to bring that to bear.

00:44:13.309 --> 00:44:17.539
Performance management, design process, so
forth and so on.

00:44:17.539 --> 00:44:18.989
Technology need identifier.

00:44:18.989 --> 00:44:25.989
I had the reputation of not wanting to advance
technology mainly because of budget constraints

00:44:28.539 --> 00:44:30.569
and I wanted to go with given technology.

00:44:30.569 --> 00:44:33.130
Is that right?

00:44:33.130 --> 00:44:38.410
I don't know if that is right or not, but
the point being is that technology can drive

00:44:38.410 --> 00:44:38.999
a program.

00:44:38.999 --> 00:44:44.519
The fact that you have to develop the technology
can drive the program.

00:44:44.519 --> 00:44:50.680
These are what the role of a systems engineering
needs to do to figure out how they are going

00:44:50.680 --> 00:44:57.680
to handle technology, if they are going to
advance technology or not.

00:44:59.849 --> 00:45:03.680
What is a system?

00:45:03.680 --> 00:45:10.680
A system is a complete solution to a defined
need in its full environment over the prescribed

00:45:11.390 --> 00:45:11.640
life.

00:45:11.519 --> 00:45:18.259
The system includes hardware, software, documentation,
human resources, nonhuman resources, esoteric

00:45:18.259 --> 00:45:18.720
factors.

00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:21.589
It includes almost everything you can think
about.

00:45:21.589 --> 00:45:25.259
Software turns out to be a big driver today.

00:45:25.259 --> 00:45:28.700
Software in the system turns out to be one
of the largest drivers.

00:45:28.700 --> 00:45:34.519
Some of you asked me, and I hope it helped,
what was the cost of the Shuttle Guidance

00:45:34.519 --> 00:45:36.039
and Navigation System.

00:45:36.039 --> 00:45:40.089
I don't know who asked me for that.

00:45:40.089 --> 00:45:41.609
Somebody asked me.

00:45:41.609 --> 00:45:46.140
Was that helpful to you, the number we gave
you?

00:45:46.140 --> 00:45:47.289
The Shuttle.

00:45:47.289 --> 00:45:50.210
They wanted to know the Shuttle.

00:45:50.210 --> 00:45:55.680
But the fact is it didn't separate the cost
of the software and the hardware.

00:45:55.680 --> 00:46:02.489
And the hardware came on pretty much on cost
but the software was a lot higher.

00:46:02.489 --> 00:46:06.079
It was exponentially growing.

00:46:06.079 --> 00:46:08.720
Software turns out to be, I don't know, Jerry,
do you want to say a word on software?

00:46:08.720 --> 00:46:15.720
Well, the problems of software were the issues
of validation, verifying tests and retests.

00:46:22.150 --> 00:46:29.150
And then every once in a while somebody would
come along and say well, but we really ought

00:46:34.390 --> 00:46:37.559
to add this.

00:46:37.559 --> 00:46:42.650
And adding on was a killer.

00:46:42.650 --> 00:46:49.650
Well, as Bill Tenel used to say, it is sort
of the garbage dump for things you couldn't

00:46:56.380 --> 00:46:58.359
do in the hardware.

00:46:58.359 --> 00:47:05.359
The number that I remember is at some point,
when you wanted to change one line of code,

00:47:05.849 --> 00:47:06.329
IBM wanted $1 million.

00:47:06.329 --> 00:47:08.349
Each time for one line of code because they
had to change the whole software, so that

00:47:08.349 --> 00:47:09.369
is why they have the software control mode
[NOISE OBSCURES].

00:47:09.369 --> 00:47:09.619
That's right.

00:47:09.579 --> 00:47:11.569
I remember when I retired, Dave Leestma, who
was head of the Astronaut Office at the time,

00:47:11.569 --> 00:47:13.069
said that he thought he could get a change
through.

00:47:13.069 --> 00:47:13.380
I forgot.

00:47:13.380 --> 00:47:13.880
It was something to do with return to launch
site.

00:47:13.880 --> 00:47:18.229
I don't remember what it was but it was some
kind of program he wanted to put in.

00:47:18.229 --> 00:47:21.450
He talked to everybody and they all approved
it, and it came to me and I turned it down.

00:47:21.450 --> 00:47:24.670
And he said at my retirement party, now Aaron
is leaving, maybe we can get it approved.

00:47:24.670 --> 00:47:25.739
But software changes do increase the cost
of the program.

00:47:25.739 --> 00:47:29.869
A simple system example.

00:47:29.869 --> 00:47:30.460
Space Shuttle.

00:47:30.460 --> 00:47:30.880
Your house.

00:47:30.880 --> 00:47:31.920
Electronic calculator.

00:47:31.920 --> 00:47:32.440
Freeway.

00:47:32.440 --> 00:47:34.529
The Golden Gate Bridge.

00:47:34.529 --> 00:47:35.569
Rapid transit.

00:47:35.569 --> 00:47:36.099
Computers.

00:47:36.099 --> 00:47:40.619
A system really involves everything.

00:47:40.619 --> 00:47:44.819
Almost everything you can think of is a system.

00:47:44.819 --> 00:47:49.150
The other thing that is interesting is this
chart right here.

00:47:49.150 --> 00:47:53.559
You may have seen this charge before, you've
seen it different ways, but the importance

00:47:53.559 --> 00:47:57.509
of systems engineering, the systems engineering
is doing the right thing right.

00:47:57.509 --> 00:48:03.479
As system increase in complexity and value,
early system decisions become increasingly

00:48:03.479 --> 00:48:03.979
important.

00:48:03.979 --> 00:48:10.979
It shows that actually in the impact of program
funding, when 10% of the program funding is

00:48:12.380 --> 00:48:17.410
accomplished you have actually committed 90%
of your dollars, systems engineering systems

00:48:17.410 --> 00:48:24.239
have actually committed 90% of your dollars,
so that means early decision-making on systems

00:48:24.239 --> 00:48:25.079
engineering.

00:48:25.079 --> 00:48:30.009
And whether you were going to make the engine
throat wide or not actually impacts the program

00:48:30.009 --> 00:48:30.849
very heavily earlier.

00:48:30.849 --> 00:48:36.200
That is why systems engineering is so important.

00:48:36.200 --> 00:48:43.200
Systems engineering is requirements in solution
management.

00:48:48.069 --> 00:48:54.069
Understanding analysis, allocations, so forth
and so on, which really affect performance,

00:48:54.069 --> 00:48:54.729
cost and schedule.

00:48:54.729 --> 00:48:58.489
And there is the three-legged stool again.

00:48:58.489 --> 00:49:03.690
This really says that if you remember certain
parameters, the continued tradeoff between

00:49:03.690 --> 00:49:10.559
cost, schedule and performance is really one
of the most important things you can understand

00:49:10.559 --> 00:49:17.559
that is really a systems engineering job.

00:49:26.710 --> 00:49:33.710
One thing I would like to talk about is the
attributes of a systems engineering.

00:49:34.289 --> 00:49:36.569
Systems engineers are very hard to come by.

00:49:36.569 --> 00:49:43.119
They really are very hard to come by, and
it is almost hard to tell you how to become

00:49:43.119 --> 00:49:43.369
one.

00:49:43.359 --> 00:49:49.190
I mean there are courses you can take, but
one thing I would suggest you do, if you really

00:49:49.190 --> 00:49:55.640
want to be a systems engineer is you specialize
in one technical area.

00:49:55.640 --> 00:50:02.640
Whether it be structures, whether it be thermodynamics,
heat transfer, guidance and control, control

00:50:02.930 --> 00:50:05.180
systems, specialize in one area.

00:50:05.180 --> 00:50:07.109
That is the first step.

00:50:07.109 --> 00:50:14.109
You need to be competent and show your competency
in one area, but then you need to broaden

00:50:14.910 --> 00:50:20.369
out a little bit and look at how people actually
operate.

00:50:20.369 --> 00:50:24.739
Good judgment of technical competence in others.

00:50:24.739 --> 00:50:28.029
Ability to build trust of team customer management.

00:50:28.029 --> 00:50:33.359
And this is what this course is about, to
work as a team and to have relationships with

00:50:33.359 --> 00:50:33.890
each other.

00:50:33.890 --> 00:50:40.890
I don't know if it was true at MIT, but many
years ago in universities it was very bad

00:50:41.420 --> 00:50:44.719
to work as a team because you tended to rely
on each other.

00:50:44.719 --> 00:50:50.499
And they wanted to have independent research,
independent development, so students were

00:50:50.499 --> 00:50:52.819
not really encouraged to work as teams.

00:50:52.819 --> 00:50:53.559
I don't know if that is true at MIT but it
was certainly true at some universities I

00:50:53.559 --> 00:50:53.809
knew.

00:50:53.650 --> 00:50:53.920
I don't know.

00:50:53.920 --> 00:50:54.200
Was it true?

00:50:54.200 --> 00:50:54.839
Well, we've gone through a major shift.

00:50:54.839 --> 00:50:56.239
And I think the rest of the country is as
well from individual to team effort.

00:50:56.239 --> 00:50:56.489
Yeah, team effort.

00:50:56.430 --> 00:50:56.680
Particularly in engineering.

00:50:56.630 --> 00:50:56.880
That's right.

00:50:56.759 --> 00:50:59.880
When I first went to A&M, they thought it
was terrible.

00:50:59.880 --> 00:51:01.039
Some of the professors thought it was terrible
working as teams.

00:51:01.039 --> 00:51:02.219
The difficult that all the top universities
have is you guys are all admitted on the basis

00:51:02.219 --> 00:51:03.039
of your high school or I guess in graduate
school your college grads, so those are individual

00:51:03.039 --> 00:51:03.380
efforts that got you here.

00:51:03.380 --> 00:51:05.140
Now we're saying put the emphasis on team
activity.

00:51:05.140 --> 00:51:07.289
The Japanese have traditionally done that
far better than we have.

00:51:07.289 --> 00:51:07.569
That's right.

00:51:07.569 --> 00:51:09.849
I just wanted to strengthen what you said
because a lot of people think that a systems

00:51:09.849 --> 00:51:11.690
engineer should be a "Jack of all trades"
and should know a little bit about everything.

00:51:11.690 --> 00:51:12.079
Absolutely not true.

00:51:12.079 --> 00:51:15.109
You have to be very good in one specific area,
and that is your baseline.

00:51:15.109 --> 00:51:15.359
That's right.

00:51:15.319 --> 00:51:22.319
The most difficult thing in engineering as
a manager is to make a decision when the guy

00:51:24.809 --> 00:51:31.809
who comes to you knows about the subject more
than you because he is the expert.

00:51:51.749 --> 00:51:58.749
And the only way you can do it is by knowing
how an expert behaves.

00:52:01.589 --> 00:52:08.589
And, in your area of expertise, you can make
that judgment.

00:52:08.910 --> 00:52:15.910
Some people are confused on this, but I think
that I 100% agree with you.

00:52:17.489 --> 00:52:24.489
You have to be an expert in one field, otherwise
it won't work.

00:52:25.190 --> 00:52:32.190
I should say there have been a lot of discussions
among the faculty in the Aero-Astro Department

00:52:35.489 --> 00:52:42.489
and perhaps in other departments as well as
to when systems engineering should be taught.

00:52:42.619 --> 00:52:46.279
Should it be taught at the undergraduate level?

00:52:46.279 --> 00:52:53.279
And right now the guiding philosophy in the
Aero-Astro Department is to devote undergraduate

00:52:55.739 --> 00:53:02.739
time really to building up expertise in the
individual subject matter, as Elliot said.

00:53:03.509 --> 00:53:10.509
The idea being that wait until you really
have a good grounding as an engineer in one

00:53:10.979 --> 00:53:17.979
or more specific subjects, and then, at the
graduate level, that is time enough to actually

00:53:18.710 --> 00:53:23.690
look at systems engineering as a discipline
so that you can draw on the expertise that

00:53:23.690 --> 00:53:24.680
you have built up.

00:53:24.680 --> 00:53:29.219
That is not a universally held decision.

00:53:29.219 --> 00:53:36.219
And there are people who make a good pedagogical
case that you can actually start teaching

00:53:36.380 --> 00:53:41.079
principles of systems engineering right from
the freshman level.

00:53:41.079 --> 00:53:48.079
And, in the whole CDIO philosophy that our
department tries to follow, we try to develop

00:53:50.269 --> 00:53:55.529
these principles which we think will then
be useful as you get into more technical aspects

00:53:55.529 --> 00:53:57.079
of systems engineering levels.

00:53:57.079 --> 00:54:04.079
We always try to balance the technical expertise
with the systems level thinking.

00:54:04.900 --> 00:54:06.259
Yes, Jerry.

00:54:06.259 --> 00:54:13.259
I would like to point out that in the organizing
teams, a key important feature of that is

00:54:20.130 --> 00:54:22.269
to have that systems engineer who is organizing
the team and setting up the meetings to know

00:54:22.269 --> 00:54:23.019
why and who should be attending.

00:54:23.019 --> 00:54:27.969
I attended a number of Space Station meetings
when I had these product teams where every

00:54:27.969 --> 00:54:30.140
company in the world was there.

00:54:30.140 --> 00:54:31.950
And you had 50 people sitting around and there
were only four who were real contributors,

00:54:31.950 --> 00:54:32.900
and the others I could swear were falling
asleep.

00:54:32.900 --> 00:54:39.900
You fundamentally have to have good management
in team setups.

00:54:44.430 --> 00:54:46.609
Well, you're absolutely right.

00:54:46.609 --> 00:54:51.829
Of course, one of the problems with Space
Station, in all honesty, if you had tried

00:54:51.829 --> 00:54:56.690
to devise a management system that was complex
the Space Station system would have won because

00:54:56.690 --> 00:54:57.950
it is probably the most complex management
system.

00:54:57.950 --> 00:54:59.269
In fact, I tried to explain it to the Bob
Gilruth one time, who is another man I should

00:54:59.269 --> 00:54:59.519
have mentioned.

00:54:59.329 --> 00:55:03.029
He was the Director of the Johnson Space Center.

00:55:03.029 --> 00:55:07.910
And he came to see me and his eyes just rolled
back in his head.

00:55:07.910 --> 00:55:12.089
He couldn't figure out what I was talking
about.

00:55:12.089 --> 00:55:13.089
So, you're right.

00:55:13.089 --> 00:55:16.779
But, you know, the other person that agrees
with you, Elliot, is Chris Kraft.

00:55:16.779 --> 00:55:23.779
Chris Kraft feels very strongly about becoming
an expert in one field before you tackle something.

00:55:24.549 --> 00:55:25.359
Self-motivated.

00:55:25.359 --> 00:55:26.599
Able to motivate others.

00:55:26.599 --> 00:55:33.599
In matrix management, that becomes a good
systems engineer, if you're able to motivate

00:55:34.239 --> 00:55:34.690
others.

00:55:34.690 --> 00:55:35.130
Methodical.

00:55:35.130 --> 00:55:35.579
Analytical.

00:55:35.579 --> 00:55:36.029
Intuitive.

00:55:36.029 --> 00:55:36.279
Questioning.

00:55:36.180 --> 00:55:36.829
Open-minded.

00:55:36.829 --> 00:55:41.569
I think that is one of the key points, being
open-minded.

00:55:41.569 --> 00:55:48.569
If you make a mistake be ready to accept the
mistake and correct it and make a change to

00:55:51.479 --> 00:55:52.209
it.

00:55:52.209 --> 00:55:53.950
That is very important in systems engineering,
especially if you have to make some important

00:55:53.950 --> 00:55:54.200
decisions.

00:55:54.059 --> 00:55:54.309
Confident.

00:55:54.180 --> 00:55:55.450
A good communicator.

00:55:55.450 --> 00:55:58.069
High level of integrity.

00:55:58.069 --> 00:56:04.079
So, that is really some of my background on
systems engineering.

00:56:04.079 --> 00:56:10.499
Now, let's talk a little bit about more how
you go about doing it.

00:56:10.499 --> 00:56:12.180
Thank you, Elliot.

00:56:12.180 --> 00:56:19.180
A system is generally considered a conglomeration
of objects that perform a specific function.

00:56:35.319 --> 00:56:36.339
And you can think of those.

00:56:36.339 --> 00:56:40.979
I mean you can think of all those in the laptop
computers you have, many things like that

00:56:40.979 --> 00:56:43.109
which we talked about.

00:56:43.109 --> 00:56:45.400
And I mentioned this before.

00:56:45.400 --> 00:56:47.809
This is what I say.

00:56:47.809 --> 00:56:51.599
It is a postulate or whatever you want to
call it.

00:56:51.599 --> 00:56:57.219
What is important for the whole system is
nearly identical to what would be the best

00:56:57.219 --> 00:57:00.609
in the long-run for each of its components.

00:57:00.609 --> 00:57:04.190
However, what is best for each individual
constituent may not be the best for the whole

00:57:04.190 --> 00:57:04.440
system.

00:57:04.269 --> 00:57:08.479
And so that really is something you need to
keep in mind.

00:57:08.479 --> 00:57:12.019
That is really the postulate of systems engineering.

00:57:12.019 --> 00:57:19.019
It may be the right thing for the system but
it may not be the right thing for the total

00:57:22.660 --> 00:57:23.789
configuration.

00:57:23.789 --> 00:57:30.789
And the systems engineering process is the
customer/user need analysis, mission requirements,

00:57:32.190 --> 00:57:36.180
functional analysis, system concept, development,
tradeoffs, design.

00:57:36.180 --> 00:57:42.259
Now, this is systems engineering as it pertains
to design.

00:57:42.259 --> 00:57:46.849
Now, there is systems engineering as it pertains
to operations, but this is systems engineering

00:57:46.849 --> 00:57:48.479
as it pertains to design.

00:57:48.479 --> 00:57:51.989
Design optimization, requirements flow down,
telecommunication, design insurance, verification

00:57:51.989 --> 00:57:55.400
audit and then you go through this iteration
process.

00:57:55.400 --> 00:57:58.890
In fact, this is what you do in your mind.

00:57:58.890 --> 00:57:59.979
I am sure you do that.

00:57:59.979 --> 00:58:03.579
When I taught this, when I spoke about this
to several professors, my friends at Texas

00:58:03.579 --> 00:58:06.719
A&M, they say well, there is nothing in this.

00:58:06.719 --> 00:58:10.509
They said it is all commonsense.

00:58:10.509 --> 00:58:13.859
And, to a greater extent, it is commonsense.

00:58:13.859 --> 00:58:17.029
But the problem is do you really practice
it?

00:58:17.029 --> 00:58:21.150
Do you really have a process in place and
do you really practice it?

00:58:21.150 --> 00:58:25.979
And we find that we don't really practice
it too well.

00:58:25.979 --> 00:58:28.239
And we say this over and over again.

00:58:28.239 --> 00:58:35.239
But the three factors of systems engineering
will be the cost, schedule and performance.

00:58:35.849 --> 00:58:39.499
And that is the famous three-legged stool
that we talked about many times.

00:58:39.499 --> 00:58:41.969
But that really is the essence.

00:58:41.969 --> 00:58:47.079
And, you as an engineer going to work and
getting paid, that is what you're going to

00:58:47.079 --> 00:58:50.739
be paid for, getting a product out the door
that essentially meets the cost schedule and

00:58:50.739 --> 00:58:50.989
performance.

00:58:50.969 --> 00:58:51.219
You look quizzical.

00:58:51.019 --> 00:58:51.269
Excuse me.

00:58:51.069 --> 00:58:51.319
No, go ahead.

00:58:51.160 --> 00:58:51.920
The statistic that you gave.

00:58:51.920 --> 00:58:53.599
After 10% of the project funding then you
have 90% of your requirements defined, do

00:58:53.599 --> 00:59:00.599
you think that function there might change
today now that we have faster prototyping

00:59:18.170 --> 00:59:20.049
tools?

00:59:20.049 --> 00:59:21.339
It could change, yes.

00:59:21.339 --> 00:59:23.940
This was done some time ago.

00:59:23.940 --> 00:59:24.599
Technology is changing.

00:59:24.599 --> 00:59:25.880
Rapid prototype is changing.

00:59:25.880 --> 00:59:28.640
CAD design.

00:59:28.640 --> 00:59:31.219
A lot of things are changing.

00:59:31.219 --> 00:59:38.219
It might be not quite as dramatic, you might
say, but it is still going to be there.

00:59:42.130 --> 00:59:46.789
A lot of your system engineering decisions
are going to affect your end product very

00:59:46.789 --> 00:59:48.299
early in the game.

00:59:48.299 --> 00:59:55.299
And one reason why that 90% gets locked in
is because of the difficulty of making changes

00:59:58.089 --> 00:59:59.950
once you've got all the plans drawn.

00:59:59.950 --> 01:00:00.200
That's right.

01:00:00.160 --> 01:00:07.160
And so, to the extent that CAD systems make
it easier to change drawings and propagate

01:00:07.900 --> 01:00:14.579
changes throughout the system, it may be that
making certain changes are less expensive

01:00:14.579 --> 01:00:15.519
than they might have been.

01:00:15.519 --> 01:00:22.519
As Jerry said about software, you start changing
your software around, you've got to do re-verification

01:00:27.029 --> 01:00:27.599
and so on.

01:00:27.599 --> 01:00:34.599
Certainly, to the degree that modern techniques
might make things more flexible, that number

01:00:38.999 --> 01:00:40.869
might get pushed down a little bit.

01:00:40.869 --> 01:00:47.869
But generally, once you've gone through preliminary
design review, you have basically set the

01:00:49.670 --> 01:00:56.069
parameters of your project and things have
a momentum and it really does get harder to

01:00:56.069 --> 01:00:56.319
change.

01:00:56.109 --> 01:01:01.369
And, of course, once you've gotten to the
critical design review -- That's right.

01:01:01.369 --> 01:01:05.680
At that point you're starting to cut metal.

01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:12.680
And then, once you've actually started to
build something, the price of changes goes

01:01:12.799 --> 01:01:14.349
up astronomically.

01:01:14.349 --> 01:01:21.349
When we did the Apollo Program we started
in '61.

01:01:22.130 --> 01:01:29.130
It is my guess that by '64, and not too far
into '64, I remember June of '64 we had the

01:01:32.059 --> 01:01:33.319
implementation meetings with Apollo.

01:01:33.319 --> 01:01:35.920
By that time all the hardware definition was
in place.

01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:36.440
That's right.

01:01:36.440 --> 01:01:37.999
The program went on after that.

01:01:37.999 --> 01:01:44.999
And the only thing that kept growing or changing
was software, but the basic hardware picture

01:01:45.619 --> 01:01:49.749
was pretty much the nail was in, in 1964,
three years into the program.

01:01:49.749 --> 01:01:53.680
Well, as Jeff said, once you start cutting
chips and start cutting hardware it is pretty

01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:55.660
hard to make changes.

01:01:55.660 --> 01:02:00.099
If I could clarify.

01:02:00.099 --> 01:02:05.380
What exactly is it that is being locked in?

01:02:05.380 --> 01:02:06.529
Well, usually your requirements.

01:02:06.529 --> 01:02:11.449
Primarily what your requirements are is the
big driver.

01:02:11.449 --> 01:02:18.180
And then, once your requirements are defined,
you can actually start your iterative process

01:02:18.180 --> 01:02:20.109
of design.

01:02:20.109 --> 01:02:26.329
Once you get your functional performance requirements
defined, you then start your design iteration

01:02:26.329 --> 01:02:31.489
and you start locking into things and, pretty
quick, you start cutting hardware and software.

01:02:31.489 --> 01:02:36.209
Hopefully you have gotten a sense, from all
of the lectures on the subsystems of the Shuttle,

01:02:36.209 --> 01:02:40.719
the degree to which they interact with one
another.

01:02:40.719 --> 01:02:42.969
That's a good point.

01:02:42.969 --> 01:02:49.969
I mean imagine if halfway down the road there
had been a major change to the thermal protection

01:02:52.690 --> 01:02:56.599
system which had bumped the weight up by,
say, 20%.

01:02:56.599 --> 01:03:02.420
Imagine the ripples that that would have affected.

01:03:02.420 --> 01:03:09.420
Or, if somebody wanted to change the requirements
for cross-range, after you had done the basic

01:03:10.140 --> 01:03:10.829
design of the system.

01:03:10.829 --> 01:03:14.829
Let me give you a very real example in that.

01:03:14.829 --> 01:03:15.979
We had the wing basically designed.

01:03:15.979 --> 01:03:21.670
And you know that the landing gear comes up
in the wing box.

01:03:21.670 --> 01:03:28.670
Well, we came to the conclusion that if you
blew one tire on touchdown you could blow

01:03:28.920 --> 01:03:30.499
all the tires.

01:03:30.499 --> 01:03:35.229
And so, what they wanted to do is increase
the number of tires that went into the wheel

01:03:35.229 --> 01:03:35.670
well.

01:03:35.670 --> 01:03:37.779
And that was pretty late in the program.

01:03:37.779 --> 01:03:43.549
I mean we had already decided, from the systems
engineering point of view, we were going to

01:03:43.549 --> 01:03:47.499
have the number of wheels we had and go up
into the wheel well.

01:03:47.499 --> 01:03:53.299
But then came along a study that showed well,
if you blew one tire you're liable to lose

01:03:53.299 --> 01:03:54.509
the vehicle on touchdown.

01:03:54.509 --> 01:03:59.999
They wanted to go put more tires into that
wheel well.

01:03:59.999 --> 01:04:01.249
Well, can you imagine what that would do?

01:04:01.249 --> 01:04:06.630
That would be redesigning the whole wing when
the wing was built, so we lived with that.

01:04:06.630 --> 01:04:12.219
We lived with that with some risk, but you
didn't make the change to it.

01:04:12.219 --> 01:04:16.329
That's the type of thing that gets into it.

01:04:16.329 --> 01:04:20.839
And I'm sure there are a number of items I
could talk about that would cause that problem

01:04:20.839 --> 01:04:22.479
to occur.

01:04:22.479 --> 01:04:29.479
Sometimes if you come up with a problem that
really would be fatal, you've got to change

01:04:34.640 --> 01:04:34.890
it.
You've got to stop, yeah.

01:04:36.619 --> 01:04:40.749
And one of the examples being the O ring seal
on the solid booster.

01:04:40.749 --> 01:04:45.869
In retrospect, people have said we should
have changed that at the beginning.

01:04:45.869 --> 01:04:49.089
Now, who knows?

01:04:49.089 --> 01:04:53.569
If on one of the Shuttle flights a tire had
blown and we had lost the entire vehicle,

01:04:53.569 --> 01:04:56.160
there would have been an accident investigation
board.

01:04:56.160 --> 01:05:01.199
And they would have gone back and said we
were flying with an untenable system.

01:05:01.199 --> 01:05:02.690
And we should have made that change.

01:05:02.690 --> 01:05:09.690
And that is where the engineer who has become
a manager is really faced with a tough potentially

01:05:11.739 --> 01:05:14.009
life or death decision.

01:05:14.009 --> 01:05:21.009
And there is always an element of risk, but
if you try to take out all the elements of

01:05:22.329 --> 01:05:24.440
risk you will never fly.

01:05:24.440 --> 01:05:25.380
Well, that's absolutely right.

01:05:25.380 --> 01:05:28.920
And so how do you make that judgment?

01:05:28.920 --> 01:05:33.949
As I said, that is why they pay you such a
big salary.

01:05:33.949 --> 01:05:37.749
Well, the interesting part about that is after
the Challenger accident my deputy, who became

01:05:37.749 --> 01:05:41.019
a very good friend of yours, Paul Whites,
who was an astronaut, a Navy fighter pilot.

01:05:41.019 --> 01:05:48.019
And our job was to get the Shuttle flying
again after the Challenger accident.

01:05:49.069 --> 01:05:53.759
I thought I brought it with me.

01:05:53.759 --> 01:06:00.759
We found this picture of a ship on a very
ominous sea.

01:06:01.459 --> 01:06:06.019
It said a ship in the harbor is safe, but
that is not what ships are built for.

01:06:06.019 --> 01:06:09.880
You could make it so safe that you could never
fly or you could never fly cross-country or

01:06:09.880 --> 01:06:11.229
you could never take a train.

01:06:11.229 --> 01:06:12.729
You've got to use some judgment.

01:06:12.729 --> 01:06:19.729
And, of course, that risk today, that risk
level today is not very well accepted.

01:06:22.269 --> 01:06:29.269
A point I was trying to make is that during
the Apollo Program it was accepted.

01:06:35.229 --> 01:06:40.380
We knew we had to take risk.

01:06:40.380 --> 01:06:42.119
Tell me when you want to break, Jeff.

01:06:42.119 --> 01:06:44.799
Do you want to break now?

01:06:44.799 --> 01:06:45.619
This is probably a good time.

01:06:45.619 --> 01:06:45.869
OK.

01:06:45.749 --> 01:06:46.519
We will take about a five minute break.

01:06:46.519 --> 01:06:47.880
I want to get to cost, but I have got a few
more things to say.

01:06:47.880 --> 01:06:48.309
Let me talk about process.

01:06:48.309 --> 01:06:53.369
We had a contract with Ford Motor Company,
and I showed this to Ford Motor Company of

01:06:53.369 --> 01:06:53.619
a design process I would go through.

01:06:53.549 --> 01:06:57.099
And they said that is very interesting, we
studied for a long time and this is exactly

01:06:57.099 --> 01:07:04.099
what we use to understand the need.

01:07:04.130 --> 01:07:04.549
And the need was not the Ford Edsel.

01:07:04.549 --> 01:07:07.680
That was not a good needs statement.

01:07:07.680 --> 01:07:14.680
But you need a need, you need a need analysis
[OVERLAPPING VOICES].

01:07:16.920 --> 01:07:19.430
Well, I tell you.

01:07:19.430 --> 01:07:20.869
You need to talk to Henry Pohl.

01:07:20.869 --> 01:07:23.449
Henry Pohl, who heard lecture, still has an
Edsel.

01:07:23.449 --> 01:07:28.288
Henry is probably one of the few people that
still has an Edsel in his garage.

01:07:28.288 --> 01:07:34.449
Henry has a lot of things like that, but Henry
still has an Edsel.

01:07:34.449 --> 01:07:38.130
But you need to do a need analysis, understand
what the need means.

01:07:38.130 --> 01:07:39.160
You need a function structure.

01:07:39.160 --> 01:07:45.890
And, actually, in some of your reports I saw
very good examples of all these.

01:07:45.890 --> 01:07:50.940
Now, maybe not in all the reports, but I saw
somebody talking about the needs, somebody

01:07:50.940 --> 01:07:55.999
talking about needs analysis, somebody talking
about function structure requirements.

01:07:55.999 --> 01:08:01.489
The hardest thing for engineers to do, especially
young engineers to do, is to make some assumptions

01:08:01.489 --> 01:08:04.619
and constraints and do some preliminary calculations.

01:08:04.619 --> 01:08:07.299
It is very difficult for them to do that.

01:08:07.299 --> 01:08:09.130
They like to see F=ma.

01:08:09.130 --> 01:08:14.799
And I once mentioned that to Joe Shea, and
he said I am glad you were still on your formula

01:08:14.799 --> 01:08:17.469
when I talked about F=ma.

01:08:17.469 --> 01:08:22.380
You need some calculations and then you need
to do some conceptual designs.

01:08:22.380 --> 01:08:25.490
And that really is, you might say, the design
process.

01:08:25.490 --> 01:08:32.490
And you can use various forms of it, but that
is probably the best form of it you can think

01:08:35.460 --> 01:08:39.399
about.

01:08:39.399 --> 01:08:46.399
Systems engineering.

01:08:47.300 --> 01:08:54.300
Interdisciplinary activities.

01:08:55.200 --> 01:08:55.710
Customer need.

01:08:55.710 --> 01:08:57.200
Functional identification requirements.

01:08:57.200 --> 01:09:02.200
Iterative design process with reviews at various
stages.

01:09:02.200 --> 01:09:03.180
Conceptual, preliminary and final designs.

01:09:03.180 --> 01:09:05.229
And that is what Professor Hoffman was talking
about.

01:09:05.229 --> 01:09:12.229
As you go downstream very quickly on that
it becomes harder and harder and harder to

01:09:12.839 --> 01:09:14.068
make changes.

01:09:14.068 --> 01:09:18.920
Let me now stop with systems engineering,
not that I couldn't go longer.

01:09:18.920 --> 01:09:25.720
But let me stop with systems engineering and
talk to you about a subject you're probably

01:09:25.720 --> 01:09:31.130
having more problems with than anything, and
that is how you do a cost analysis.

01:09:31.130 --> 01:09:38.130
And, unfortunately, I am not going to give
you a closed form solution for it.

01:09:38.390 --> 01:09:39.309
There is none.

01:09:39.309 --> 01:09:45.410
Not only that, I did the 90-day study when
President Bush was president.

01:09:45.410 --> 01:09:50.050
I stood on the steps of the Smithsonian.

01:09:50.050 --> 01:09:55.230
Dick Truly appointed me to do it.

01:09:55.230 --> 01:10:01.170
And that study was really paned by everything.

01:10:01.170 --> 01:10:02.940
Because they said give us a cost analysis.

01:10:02.940 --> 01:10:07.309
And I really thought they wanted to know what
it was going to cost so I told them.

01:10:07.309 --> 01:10:10.420
Well, they didn't like it.

01:10:10.420 --> 01:10:16.059
And, in all honesty, I really wasn't that
high because it was a 30-year project.

01:10:16.059 --> 01:10:23.059
I gave them the cost for a 30-year project
actually building launch vehicles, technology.

01:10:23.890 --> 01:10:28.600
But, nevertheless, I had my day in the barrel
on cost analysis.

01:10:28.600 --> 01:10:31.750
Let me talk a little bit about cost estimation
techniques.

01:10:31.750 --> 01:10:33.559
It turns out some of you were trying to use
it.

01:10:33.559 --> 01:10:38.520
Here are the cost estimating techniques.

01:10:38.520 --> 01:10:39.880
Expert interview.

01:10:39.880 --> 01:10:43.410
You talk to an expert in the field, if you
can find one.

01:10:43.410 --> 01:10:44.170
Parametric analysis.

01:10:44.170 --> 01:10:48.210
I am going to spend most of my time talking
about parametric cost analysis because I think

01:10:48.210 --> 01:10:52.010
that is the one that pertains to an engineering
design course.

01:10:52.010 --> 01:10:52.490
Parametrics.

01:10:52.490 --> 01:10:57.920
Because it is in terms that you understand,
weight, performance, that type of thing.

01:10:57.920 --> 01:11:02.340
I am going to talk about that.

01:11:02.340 --> 01:11:03.210
Analogies.

01:11:03.210 --> 01:11:08.870
And then the engineering which is really,
you might say, the grassroots or the buildup

01:11:08.870 --> 01:11:13.670
of what it is going to cost for engineering
hours, manufacturing hours and that type of

01:11:13.670 --> 01:11:14.930
thing, which is pretty hard to do.

01:11:14.930 --> 01:11:16.190
I am going to go through those.

01:11:16.190 --> 01:11:18.480
Now, some of you have tried to do some of
these.

01:11:18.480 --> 01:11:23.340
Some of you have tried to call contractors
to find out what a particular thing was going

01:11:23.340 --> 01:11:23.830
to cost.

01:11:23.830 --> 01:11:28.770
Some of you have tried to find out what the
Shuttle Guidance and Navigation System cost.

01:11:28.770 --> 01:11:32.059
You were trying to do it, but it's not easy
to come by.

01:11:32.059 --> 01:11:35.610
You call a vendor and he says well, he will
quote you, but he wants to know what you're

01:11:35.610 --> 01:11:36.050
going to use it for.

01:11:36.050 --> 01:11:36.690
It is hard to do.

01:11:36.690 --> 01:11:38.750
I know it is very, very hard to do.

01:11:38.750 --> 01:11:44.730
And they want to know how many hundred you
are going to buy.

01:11:44.730 --> 01:11:50.170
I don't minimize the job you have in trying
to do a cost estimate, but you've got to recognize

01:11:50.170 --> 01:11:54.760
that, as an engineer and you go out and start
to work, they are going to want to know what

01:11:54.760 --> 01:12:01.760
this thing is going to cost you and what allies
you have to make.

01:12:01.980 --> 01:12:08.750
Now, these are the cost estimating techniques
over the project cycles.

01:12:08.750 --> 01:12:15.690
You can see, as the project goes along, you
have this so-called parametric method, analogies,

01:12:15.690 --> 01:12:20.280
judgments, system level CERs, cost estimate
relationships.

01:12:20.280 --> 01:12:22.780
And that is a very key thing, cost estimate
relationships.

01:12:22.780 --> 01:12:26.600
I am going to talk more about that, but let
me tell you what a cost estimate relationship

01:12:26.600 --> 01:12:28.640
in a very simple-minded approach is.

01:12:28.640 --> 01:12:31.980
Let's say you're going to go buy a house.

01:12:31.980 --> 01:12:34.610
What is the first thing you want to know about
buying a house?

01:12:34.610 --> 01:12:37.280
How many square feet do you have, right?

01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:41.960
You take how many square feet you're going
to have and you usually know about what it

01:12:41.960 --> 01:12:46.309
cost per square foot in the area you want
to buy a house in.

01:12:46.309 --> 01:12:48.520
You multiply that and you get a rough estimate
of the house.

01:12:48.520 --> 01:12:51.180
Now, there is another factor that goes into
that.

01:12:51.180 --> 01:12:52.580
There is the culture.

01:12:52.580 --> 01:12:57.040
Where you are going to build this house is
going to affect the cost per square foot.

01:12:57.040 --> 01:13:01.070
If you build it in a very expensive neighborhood
-- I always give the relationship in Houston

01:13:01.070 --> 01:13:02.000
because I know Houston.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:07.350
If you're going to build it in Clear Lake
where NASA is, it is one culture.

01:13:07.350 --> 01:13:12.640
If you build it in River Oaks where the very
wealth oil people, it is another culture.

01:13:12.640 --> 01:13:17.600
The cost per square foot in Clear Lake is
much lower than the cost per square foot in

01:13:17.600 --> 01:13:18.670
Clear Lake.

01:13:18.670 --> 01:13:21.630
You can get a rough estimate, but that is
a very simple-minded CER.

01:13:21.630 --> 01:13:23.390
It is a cost estimate relationship.

01:13:23.390 --> 01:13:27.790
They become very, very complicated when you
talk about past history, when you talk about

01:13:27.790 --> 01:13:29.330
weight of spacecraft and so forth and so on.

01:13:29.330 --> 01:13:31.430
I will develop a little bit of that.

01:13:31.430 --> 01:13:34.600
General subsystem CERs and calibrated system
CERs.

01:13:34.600 --> 01:13:36.400
But these are the parametric methods.

01:13:36.400 --> 01:13:41.309
And you can see where they are used, analogies
and judgment.

01:13:41.309 --> 01:13:43.400
And they are used for a certain period of
time.

01:13:43.400 --> 01:13:50.400
Then, when you get to the phase B or CD, you
talk about component buildup estimates, detailed

01:13:54.059 --> 01:13:56.880
estimates and vendor quotes.

01:13:56.880 --> 01:13:58.920
That is sort of the schedule.

01:13:58.920 --> 01:14:04.260
And this was provided by the cost technology
over the project cycles by the Lunar and Mars

01:14:04.260 --> 01:14:04.980
Exploration Office.

01:14:04.980 --> 01:14:07.520
That goes way back.

01:14:07.520 --> 01:14:09.540
It has abolished and now restored again.

01:14:09.540 --> 01:14:13.610
So, that is the cycle you go through.

01:14:13.610 --> 01:14:19.750
And, of course, you're in really the phase
A so it is going to be pretty hard for you

01:14:19.750 --> 01:14:21.830
to do the direct methods.

01:14:21.830 --> 01:14:25.190
Even though you might try, it is going to
be pretty hard for you to do that.

01:14:25.190 --> 01:14:26.670
You almost have to use some type of a parametrics.

01:14:26.670 --> 01:14:30.059
And I am going to talk about how you do a
parametric.

01:14:30.059 --> 01:14:37.059
I am going to talk to you about how you do
both of them.

01:14:39.020 --> 01:14:41.750
And this can get you into more trouble.

01:14:41.750 --> 01:14:46.200
Cost estimates get you in a lot of trouble.

01:14:46.200 --> 01:14:52.190
How many in here are familiar with what we
call a work breakdown structure?

01:14:52.190 --> 01:14:53.550
OK, good.

01:14:53.550 --> 01:14:59.690
Work breakdown structure is really the management
tool that is needed in doing a project.

01:14:59.690 --> 01:15:05.940
Whenever you get a project you form a work
breakdown structure which is a hierarchical

01:15:05.940 --> 01:15:08.920
breakdown, the work necessary to complete
a project.

01:15:08.920 --> 01:15:12.960
Work breakdown structure elements should be
identified by title, by numbering system that

01:15:12.960 --> 01:15:14.290
performs the following functions.

01:15:14.290 --> 01:15:19.240
It identifies the level of the breakdown structure
element, it identifies the higher level to

01:15:19.240 --> 01:15:22.470
which the breakdown structure would be integrated
and shows the cost.

01:15:22.470 --> 01:15:23.300
That is the key thing.

01:15:23.300 --> 01:15:28.120
It shows the cost account number of the element
and how much it costs, how much labor hours

01:15:28.120 --> 01:15:28.740
is going to take.

01:15:28.740 --> 01:15:32.430
That is a very, very important tool.

01:15:32.430 --> 01:15:37.350
In fact, when you go out and work in industry,
actually, if you become a member of a work

01:15:37.350 --> 01:15:41.240
breakdown structure, you're graded on how
well you perform under this work breakdown

01:15:41.240 --> 01:15:41.490
structure.

01:15:41.440 --> 01:15:43.170
That is the tool they grade you on.

01:15:43.170 --> 01:15:45.040
We will put these charts on the Internet.

01:15:45.040 --> 01:15:48.890
Roll of the work breakdown structure.

01:15:48.890 --> 01:15:53.450
Project and technical planning and scheduling.

01:15:53.450 --> 01:15:55.140
Cost estimating and budget formulation.

01:15:55.140 --> 01:15:59.730
Project status reporting and plans such as
specifications and drawings.

01:15:59.730 --> 01:16:04.010
Now, those that raised their hands, where
did you learn to do work breakdown structure?

01:16:04.010 --> 01:16:05.570
Can anybody answer me?

01:16:05.570 --> 01:16:09.559
Where did you learn to do that, those that
said you were familiar with it?

01:16:09.559 --> 01:16:11.230
Yes, sir.

01:16:11.230 --> 01:16:13.270
I learned it here at MIT.

01:16:13.270 --> 01:16:13.520
Did you?

01:16:13.520 --> 01:16:13.770
Very good.

01:16:13.770 --> 01:16:14.140
They taught you.

01:16:14.140 --> 01:16:14.510
That's very good.

01:16:14.510 --> 01:16:15.320
What course was it?

01:16:15.320 --> 01:16:15.670
It is not a course.

01:16:15.670 --> 01:16:18.690
It is my research.

01:16:18.690 --> 01:16:20.090
Oh, your research.

01:16:20.090 --> 01:16:24.690
Did you find it hard to do?

01:16:24.690 --> 01:16:31.690
I found it initially difficult, but once I
realized how to work it, I definitely saw

01:16:34.340 --> 01:16:36.150
the benefits of that approach.

01:16:36.150 --> 01:16:36.400
Very good.
Well, it is an important tool that you need
to do.

01:16:36.690 --> 01:16:42.080
And that is why it is probably a little hard
for you to do cost estimation because you

01:16:42.080 --> 01:16:47.740
are not used to some of these things you need
to do to get the cost done.

01:16:47.740 --> 01:16:54.740
Well, some of the basic elements of cost estimation
is understand the product, develop a detailed

01:16:56.190 --> 01:16:57.450
work breakdown structure.

01:16:57.450 --> 01:16:58.380
Did you do that for this project?

01:16:58.380 --> 01:16:58.630
No.

01:16:58.400 --> 01:16:58.970
That is OK.

01:16:58.970 --> 01:17:05.650
I didn't mean to put you under the gun.

01:17:05.650 --> 01:17:07.300
Understand the development of the culture.

01:17:07.300 --> 01:17:08.720
Understand the culture.

01:17:08.720 --> 01:17:15.720
It turns out the NASA culture is pretty high
level because it does involve risk.

01:17:16.360 --> 01:17:21.710
And I will give you a little story about.

01:17:21.710 --> 01:17:28.710
Somebody asked von Braun one time why NASA
had to gold plate everything.

01:17:28.710 --> 01:17:33.700
He said because you made it out of pure gold
it would cost too much.

01:17:33.700 --> 01:17:40.440
It is not that they gold plate everything,
but it is that you really have a life concern

01:17:40.440 --> 01:17:43.010
in a very hostile environment.

01:17:43.010 --> 01:17:46.070
You have to understand the development culture.

01:17:46.070 --> 01:17:50.580
Gather data from close analogs, develop the
cost estimate relationships.

01:17:50.580 --> 01:17:54.640
There are textbooks that show you how to develop
CERs.

01:17:54.640 --> 01:17:59.530
There is a large society called parametric
cost analysis.

01:17:59.530 --> 01:18:00.920
And in that you can get how to develop CERs.

01:18:00.920 --> 01:18:06.790
I am not suggesting you necessarily do that
because it is very, very time consuming, but

01:18:06.790 --> 01:18:09.010
just know that they do exist.

01:18:09.010 --> 01:18:14.480
There are, by the way, very sophisticated
computer programs, which I want to talk about,

01:18:14.480 --> 01:18:18.390
that develop the CERs for you based on inputs
you give them.

01:18:18.390 --> 01:18:20.190
These programs are very expensive.

01:18:20.190 --> 01:18:21.630
One is called PRICE.

01:18:21.630 --> 01:18:24.980
I will show you what the other one is.

01:18:24.980 --> 01:18:28.040
And it was actually developed by RCA.

01:18:28.040 --> 01:18:31.250
It now is owned by the Martin Company.

01:18:31.250 --> 01:18:35.230
Or was owned by the Martin Company.

01:18:35.230 --> 01:18:38.320
Group CERs according to the work breakdown
structure.

01:18:38.320 --> 01:18:41.270
And you need to quantify the risk and the
method.

01:18:41.270 --> 01:18:43.820
Estimate the cost, spread the cost and do
a reality check.

01:18:43.820 --> 01:18:45.600
Those are some of the things you need to do.

01:18:45.600 --> 01:18:52.600
Now, understanding the costing and the analysis
process, as I said, you need to understand

01:19:00.750 --> 01:19:04.400
the project, participate in the design team
activities.

01:19:04.400 --> 01:19:07.750
Scoping, inheritance and complexity.

01:19:07.750 --> 01:19:12.330
Identification of content, schedule and goals.

01:19:12.330 --> 01:19:18.750
Collecting cost, estimating inputs by weight
statements, technical characteristics, preparing

01:19:18.750 --> 01:19:23.250
the estimates, CERs, translating labor hours
and dollar hours.

01:19:23.250 --> 01:19:29.290
And this is a lot of details that you are
not going to have time to do, but you do need

01:19:29.290 --> 01:19:33.790
to understand the complexity that doing cost
analysis entails.

01:19:33.790 --> 01:19:36.600
It is very, very difficult and very hard to
do.

01:19:36.600 --> 01:19:39.100
And you have groups set up to do that.

01:19:39.100 --> 01:19:44.390
But, on the other hand, engineers working
on a project are going to be called upon to

01:19:44.390 --> 01:19:48.640
do it because you are the best source of information
that they have to do it.

01:19:48.640 --> 01:19:55.640
Here is the basic building block of the parametric
cost estimating, is the relationship of the

01:20:04.270 --> 01:20:05.559
cost estimating relationship.

01:20:05.559 --> 01:20:10.000
And the dependent value variable is cost.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:13.870
The independent variable is something that
you can understand.

01:20:13.870 --> 01:20:16.420
It is weight, power, ISP and so forth.

01:20:16.420 --> 01:20:17.360
They are specific engineering terms.

01:20:17.360 --> 01:20:24.360
And there is some relationship between weight,
certainly for structures, there is certainly

01:20:26.559 --> 01:20:33.559
a value based on historical data points of
weight of the structure, the type of materials

01:20:35.270 --> 01:20:38.770
and so forth on the CER, the cost relationship.

01:20:38.770 --> 01:20:41.420
So, that is how it is developed.

01:20:41.420 --> 01:20:46.290
A lot of students had a very difficult time
using this program because they didn't know

01:20:46.290 --> 01:20:48.070
how the CERs were developed.

01:20:48.070 --> 01:20:52.230
It frustrated them because here was this magic
program that calculated the CERs for them.

01:20:52.230 --> 01:20:52.800
Right, Josh?

01:20:52.800 --> 01:20:55.270
Josh is one of my students.

01:20:55.270 --> 01:20:58.880
And they had a very difficult time trying
to understand how to use the program because

01:20:58.880 --> 01:21:02.670
they couldn't understand how to do the CERs.

01:21:02.670 --> 01:21:04.820
But there is a methodology in it.

01:21:04.820 --> 01:21:06.440
And there are many books that explain it.

01:21:06.440 --> 01:21:11.340
The other thing that is important, as I pointed
out, is the cultural variable.

01:21:11.340 --> 01:21:16.330
The cultural variable is this.

01:21:16.330 --> 01:21:20.059
See, this is one, unit dry weight.

01:21:20.059 --> 01:21:24.820
And it can show us the total cost, but it
can show that for aircraft you're on one culture

01:21:24.820 --> 01:21:29.920
plane, on an unmanned spacecraft you're on
another cultural plane, on manned spacecraft

01:21:29.920 --> 01:21:36.309
you're on another cultural plane and on a
planetary spacecraft you're on another cultural

01:21:36.309 --> 01:21:36.800
plane.

01:21:36.800 --> 01:21:38.690
That is a very big issue.

01:21:38.690 --> 01:21:43.170
One of the issues with NASA they say, to get
the cost down for NASA, is you need to change

01:21:43.170 --> 01:21:43.980
the cultural plane.

01:21:43.980 --> 01:21:48.200
Of course, if you change the cultural plane
you probably have to give up something.

01:21:48.200 --> 01:21:53.370
You probably would give up some risk in terms
of safety or margin.

01:21:53.370 --> 01:21:58.800
So, you have got to recognize that the cultural
variable is a very strong indicator.

01:21:58.800 --> 01:22:02.110
Are you happy to note that the aircraft is
so low and everybody flies on an airplane,

01:22:02.110 --> 01:22:06.020
but that is the cultural variable that it
shows.

01:22:06.020 --> 01:22:13.020
For a structure, you can see how the structure
varies based on the cultural plane.

01:22:15.920 --> 01:22:22.590
When you were talking about like using square
footage as a rough estimate for a house, and

01:22:22.590 --> 01:22:29.590
in the space business we do use weight as
kind of a substitute.

01:22:31.010 --> 01:22:33.400
You can translate from weight into cost.

01:22:33.400 --> 01:22:39.790
And yet people always point out, well, yeah,
but a kilogram of aluminum structure costs

01:22:39.790 --> 01:22:44.260
a lot less than a kilogram of computer chips.

01:22:44.260 --> 01:22:48.790
But, nevertheless, when you put everything
down when you're designing a planetary spacecraft,

01:22:48.790 --> 01:22:51.190
they do have these estimated relationships.

01:22:51.190 --> 01:22:58.190
If you're going to have a project which lands
150 kilograms on Mars compared to a ton on

01:23:00.990 --> 01:23:03.960
Mars, we do have these relationships.

01:23:03.960 --> 01:23:10.260
Because, in general, we figure that the ratio
of hardware and software and computer chips

01:23:10.260 --> 01:23:14.230
to aluminum and all that is roughly similar.

01:23:14.230 --> 01:23:19.510
But if you are going to try to build something
that is fundamentally new, which involves

01:23:19.510 --> 01:23:26.170
a lot of new technology, then of course you
can go way off of these rough estimates.

01:23:26.170 --> 01:23:31.309
To get a good understanding, you might say
a very quick understanding, you might go to

01:23:31.309 --> 01:23:36.770
the NASA website and get parametric cost analysis.

01:23:36.770 --> 01:23:40.420
It will give you a very good understanding
of what you can get.

01:23:40.420 --> 01:23:44.670
And you can get some of these programs off
the Internet today.

01:23:44.670 --> 01:23:51.200
They are not very sophisticated but they do
have some CER relationships, as Jeff was talking

01:23:51.200 --> 01:23:51.620
about.

01:23:51.620 --> 01:23:58.320
It might be a little bit more difficult for
some of the items.

01:23:58.320 --> 01:23:59.850
Structures would be an easy item to do but,
unfortunately, I don't think anybody is doing

01:23:59.850 --> 01:24:00.100
that.
But it would even be good for the avionics
system, I think, in life support.

01:24:01.870 --> 01:24:02.120
Yes.

01:24:01.950 --> 01:24:05.220
Are these software packages basically just
a large database?

01:24:05.220 --> 01:24:12.220
They are basically a large database that you
put in the data.

01:24:12.610 --> 01:24:19.610
In fact, they are so sophisticated now, you
can put in the software, the type of software

01:24:20.230 --> 01:24:24.309
you are using, the number of lines of code
and, based on the CER for that particular

01:24:24.309 --> 01:24:28.760
subject, it can tell you how much it is going
to cost per line of code.

01:24:28.760 --> 01:24:31.210
It is very, very sophisticated.

01:24:31.210 --> 01:24:31.930
And NASA uses it quite a bit.

01:24:31.930 --> 01:24:32.200
Yes?

01:24:32.200 --> 01:24:39.200
With this software, you must have to update
it very, very frequently because of technology

01:24:41.309 --> 01:24:42.480
changes.

01:24:42.480 --> 01:24:44.980
They update it very frequently.

01:24:44.980 --> 01:24:45.230
That's right.

01:24:45.080 --> 01:24:46.540
And that is why they are so expensive.

01:24:46.540 --> 01:24:48.710
They are very expensive, but they update them.

01:24:48.710 --> 01:24:52.950
For example, I started using it at A&M, and
they didn't have even a software package in

01:24:52.950 --> 01:24:53.340
there for composites.

01:24:53.340 --> 01:24:55.100
Now they have one for composites.

01:24:55.100 --> 01:25:02.100
And there are a lot of these which are proprietary
and you cannot even get access to them.

01:25:03.710 --> 01:25:10.710
I mean the Aerospace Corporation has compiled
a huge database of costs of a lot of components

01:25:12.330 --> 01:25:16.950
historical to how much it was estimated, how
much it actually cost.

01:25:16.950 --> 01:25:23.580
And so NASA and the DOD often go to Aerospace
to do cost analysis for them.

01:25:23.580 --> 01:25:25.100
And, of course, Aerospace charges.

01:25:25.100 --> 01:25:30.390
And they don't release their database because
it is proprietary.

01:25:30.390 --> 01:25:35.090
Knowledge is power and money in this situation.

01:25:35.090 --> 01:25:42.090
They put a lot of work into putting the database
together.

01:25:47.440 --> 01:25:47.690
Yes.

01:25:47.600 --> 01:25:47.920
[AUDIENCE QUESTION]

01:25:47.920 --> 01:25:48.730
Were you able to try to use it?

01:25:48.730 --> 01:25:51.470
Did you try to check it out?

01:25:51.470 --> 01:25:54.850
[AUDIENCE QUESTION]

01:25:54.850 --> 01:26:00.110
And, of course, it may not have the update
as this gentleman was talking about, but it

01:26:00.110 --> 01:26:01.460
has a certain amount.

01:26:01.460 --> 01:26:03.400
You could do a pretty quick analysis.

01:26:03.400 --> 01:26:10.400
I would suggest you try to do that because
I know that I had looked at it, and there

01:26:11.460 --> 01:26:12.160
are ways to do it.

01:26:12.160 --> 01:26:15.150
Now, you've got to be careful of the results
because sometimes the results become pretty

01:26:15.150 --> 01:26:15.830
high.

01:26:15.830 --> 01:26:22.780
But you've got to be careful of the results
and look at it pretty carefully.

01:26:22.780 --> 01:26:25.830
This is another development of cost scaling
law.

01:26:25.830 --> 01:26:32.830
This happens to be weight versus -- You can
see the two different cultural planes, known

01:26:33.380 --> 01:26:36.680
cost and weight, unknown cost from a given
weight.

01:26:36.680 --> 01:26:39.320
This is basically how they generate the CERs.

01:26:39.320 --> 01:26:40.500
It is a process.

01:26:40.500 --> 01:26:43.860
It isn't an analytical process, but there
also is a lot of empirical data that goes

01:26:43.860 --> 01:26:45.480
with it.

01:26:45.480 --> 01:26:52.320
And, as Jeff said, it is based on a large
database.

01:26:52.320 --> 01:26:59.320
Now, cost estimation, I am telling you hard
it is to do and you probably already know

01:26:59.600 --> 01:27:00.110
it.

01:27:00.110 --> 01:27:05.050
But, for a cost estimation, now, this is after
you get over the errors of parametric cost

01:27:05.050 --> 01:27:05.300
analysis.

01:27:05.290 --> 01:27:10.880
Now we're talking about how you do a cost
analysis when you're really trying to figure

01:27:10.880 --> 01:27:15.760
how you go forward to ask for a budget.

01:27:15.760 --> 01:27:18.280
You need fairly detailed information.

01:27:18.280 --> 01:27:23.010
It is unrealistic for designers to give cost
information for conceptualist designs, but

01:27:23.010 --> 01:27:27.230
designers must be able to make rough cost
estimates.

01:27:27.230 --> 01:27:33.160
That is what I am saying, that you do need
to be able to make rough cost estimates.

01:27:33.160 --> 01:27:39.580
Now, if you are trying to make a detailed
cost estimate, and that goes back to the work

01:27:39.580 --> 01:27:45.570
breakdown structure, you need the number of
labor hours and number of people on the project.

01:27:45.570 --> 01:27:49.590
I mean people is probably going to be the
most expensive.

01:27:49.590 --> 01:27:55.350
You need the number of labor hours, the number
of people on the project.

01:27:55.350 --> 01:27:59.630
During the Shuttle Program, Orbiter Project
Manager, I used to call my counterpart at

01:27:59.630 --> 01:28:01.390
Rockwell every Saturday morning.

01:28:01.390 --> 01:28:07.240
And we would go through how many people we
had on each work breakdown structure for each

01:28:07.240 --> 01:28:07.490
contractor.

01:28:07.380 --> 01:28:12.570
We would talk about it to be sure we had the
budget to cover it.

01:28:12.570 --> 01:28:15.430
And then, of course, we had to be sure we
got the product out the door.

01:28:15.430 --> 01:28:19.580
But the number of labor hours, the number
of people on the project, the length of time

01:28:19.580 --> 01:28:24.559
these people are going to be on it, the overhead
rates, office space, computer, benefits, cost

01:28:24.559 --> 01:28:28.260
per hour of a person basically is what you
are looking for, that is how you really do

01:28:28.260 --> 01:28:30.130
a cost estimate.

01:28:30.130 --> 01:28:35.670
And, of course, it is going to vary, depending
on the locale of the contractor.

01:28:35.670 --> 01:28:36.590
What are the cost drivers?

01:28:36.590 --> 01:28:43.590
Now, here is where the cost comes out, some
of the things that Dr.

01:28:44.290 --> 01:28:45.030
Hoffman was talking about.

01:28:45.030 --> 01:28:47.340
The errors in the design.

01:28:47.340 --> 01:28:49.520
Change in requirements.

01:28:49.520 --> 01:28:52.630
Core interface definition.

01:28:52.630 --> 01:28:53.170
Technology development.

01:28:53.170 --> 01:28:54.100
Poor communication.

01:28:54.100 --> 01:28:55.500
Poor teamwork.

01:28:55.500 --> 01:29:02.190
These are all elements of systems engineering
that have gone awry, that have not gone in

01:29:02.190 --> 01:29:03.550
the right direction.

01:29:03.550 --> 01:29:06.140
But this is what caused the cost to go up.

01:29:06.140 --> 01:29:12.090
In my experience, the biggest problem in cost
estimates have been the changes in requirements.

01:29:12.090 --> 01:29:16.710
That is really the thing that has caused most
of the problems.

01:29:16.710 --> 01:29:21.160
That is why you need really good definition
requirements and not change it.

01:29:21.160 --> 01:29:27.020
Technology development, that can cost you
a lot of money and sometimes you have to go

01:29:27.020 --> 01:29:31.590
forward with it.

01:29:31.590 --> 01:29:38.590
Now, this is old data.

01:29:39.280 --> 01:29:43.150
This is 1993 data, but I got this from a contractor
a long time ago.

01:29:43.150 --> 01:29:47.440
First of all what you need to do, and of course
it is a lot different, I don't know if it

01:29:47.440 --> 01:29:47.690
is higher or lower today with CAD systems,
this was before they really used CAD systems,

01:29:47.630 --> 01:29:48.320
but this the average cost of an engineering
drawing.

01:29:48.320 --> 01:29:52.200
And it goes through how you do it.

01:29:52.200 --> 01:29:57.110
It is probably the labor rates are higher
today.

01:29:57.110 --> 01:29:59.210
The average hours per drawing are probably
lower.

01:29:59.210 --> 01:30:02.520
But this says in 1993, the rate is an estimate
for 1993 government year of about $3,000 in

01:30:02.520 --> 01:30:05.710
average drawing, so you have to figure out
how many drawings you need.

01:30:05.710 --> 01:30:12.210
I mean that is a good way to understand the
cost estimate of what it is going to be.

01:30:12.210 --> 01:30:18.210
You need to know how many drawings you need
and you need an understanding of the cost

01:30:18.210 --> 01:30:18.460
settlement.
The elements of cost during manufacturing
then are the number and complexity of the

01:30:25.030 --> 01:30:30.630
drawings, cost of a drawing, number and complexity
of machine and fabricated parts and what the

01:30:30.630 --> 01:30:32.570
parts are made out of.

01:30:32.570 --> 01:30:39.240
Aluminum, steel, titanium, nickel, inconel
and so forth, because some are more complicated

01:30:39.240 --> 01:30:40.760
to machine than others.

01:30:40.760 --> 01:30:46.280
But some are used in the Space Program, some
are not.

01:30:46.280 --> 01:30:50.130
Titanium was becoming more and more important.

01:30:50.130 --> 01:30:57.130
Other things of manufacturing are tolerance
of parts.

01:31:00.010 --> 01:31:04.880
It turns out engineers tend to, you might
say, put extra tolerances on parts that they

01:31:04.880 --> 01:31:05.700
don't need.

01:31:05.700 --> 01:31:08.940
And that can cause parts to be very, very
expensive.

01:31:08.940 --> 01:31:12.880
The finish of parts, the quality of parts,
assembly, complexity and time qualification

01:31:12.880 --> 01:31:13.630
of checking a test.

01:31:13.630 --> 01:31:17.020
I remember my first day at work, when I worked
for RCA, I was designing a microwave tube,

01:31:17.020 --> 01:31:17.270
magnetron.

01:31:17.260 --> 01:31:20.570
I was a terrible draftsman, as a matter of
fact.

01:31:20.570 --> 01:31:20.820
That was a long time ago.

01:31:20.650 --> 01:31:22.550
I would probably be better with CAD systems.

01:31:22.550 --> 01:31:28.760
But I sent out this part to the shop.

01:31:28.760 --> 01:31:35.760
And this guy coming in showing this stogy
out in the machine shop.

01:31:39.850 --> 01:31:45.920
At that time we sat in these big bullpens,
each person at a desk, and I had my name on

01:31:45.920 --> 01:31:46.590
my desk.

01:31:46.590 --> 01:31:53.260
He comes in this big room and says where the
hell is Cohen?

01:31:53.260 --> 01:31:53.530
That is me.

01:31:53.530 --> 01:31:56.930
He said this is the dumbest drawing I have
ever seen in my life.

01:31:56.930 --> 01:31:59.130
How do you expect anybody to make this part?

01:31:59.130 --> 01:32:02.190
So, you have to be sure you understand what
you are doing.

01:32:02.190 --> 01:32:07.920
It turns out I learned to work with that guy
and became good friends.

01:32:07.920 --> 01:32:12.280
That never happened again, but he wanted to
know where the hell was this Cohen who put

01:32:12.280 --> 01:32:12.830
out this dumb drawing?

01:32:12.830 --> 01:32:14.330
He said there is no way I can make this part.

01:32:14.330 --> 01:32:18.580
And that was a small part, but you need to
understand the complexity of the part and

01:32:18.580 --> 01:32:21.670
what you're putting out to the shop.

01:32:21.670 --> 01:32:24.240
But today they have checks and balances.

01:32:24.240 --> 01:32:28.730
And, with the CAD systems, I am not even sure
this is accurate anymore.

01:32:28.730 --> 01:32:32.350
This about brings me to the close of what
I wanted to talk to you about, but let me

01:32:32.350 --> 01:32:34.320
just give you one final chart.

01:32:34.320 --> 01:32:39.090
And then I would like you to ask some questions
about anything I talked about or anything

01:32:39.090 --> 01:32:43.860
anybody else covered that you heard about.

01:32:43.860 --> 01:32:48.220
I would stress that for you today in your
course is to try to use parametric cost analysis.

01:32:48.220 --> 01:32:49.590
That is what I would think you should do.

01:32:49.590 --> 01:32:52.309
At least that is what I think you ought to
do.

01:32:52.309 --> 01:32:54.880
And I think you can get information off the
Internet that will allow you to do something.

01:32:54.880 --> 01:32:56.980
Now, it may not pertain to all projects.

01:32:56.980 --> 01:33:01.990
I am not saying you have to do it, but it
might be the thing to do.

01:33:01.990 --> 01:33:02.510
It is going to be very difficult.

01:33:02.510 --> 01:33:04.420
Doing the right thing by creating a work breakdown
structure in trying to do that, it is going

01:33:04.420 --> 01:33:10.380
to be very difficult for you to do it in this
course.

01:33:10.380 --> 01:33:15.530
But the parametric approach to cost, hardware
costs are not produced from parts less than

01:33:15.530 --> 01:33:17.400
labor tables, so you don't need that.

01:33:17.400 --> 01:33:21.120
They are produced from general measures of
the impact of such items costs and in preparing

01:33:21.120 --> 01:33:26.570
inexpensive and more realistic and manageable
costs based on cost estimating relationships.

01:33:26.570 --> 01:33:31.250
You might want to do some reading on cost
estimating relationships, and there are a

01:33:31.250 --> 01:33:35.180
lot of references to that, just to be sure
you understand what I am talking about and

01:33:35.180 --> 01:33:39.690
what they are so it is not a complete mystery
to you so you get a better feel for what it

01:33:39.690 --> 01:33:40.160
is.

01:33:40.160 --> 01:33:43.990
A lot of textbooks have cost estimating relationships.

01:33:43.990 --> 01:33:50.990
CERs make use of characteristics that can
be readily quantifiable such as weight, size

01:33:51.340 --> 01:33:57.010
and to estimate variables that are difficult
to quantify such as cost and production schedules.

01:33:57.010 --> 01:34:02.400
As I said, parametric models can range from
a simple arithmetical relationship to a sophisticated

01:34:02.400 --> 01:34:08.130
computerized model so they can be very, very
complicated or very simple.

01:34:08.130 --> 01:34:10.700
And I suggest you try to do that.

01:34:10.700 --> 01:34:17.700
Let me just show you what the programs are,
not that you will be able to get them, but

01:34:19.070 --> 01:34:25.410
when you get out of industry, if I can find
them here.

01:34:25.410 --> 01:34:32.410
Well, it may not happen.

01:34:36.930 --> 01:34:39.880
There is certainly a lot of information.

01:34:39.880 --> 01:34:42.059
Here is the price model.

01:34:42.059 --> 01:34:46.270
That is price H.

01:34:46.270 --> 01:34:51.639
And you can actually do structural weight
material types, tolerances.

01:34:51.639 --> 01:34:56.600
You can actually do electronics, digital,
analog technology.

01:34:56.600 --> 01:35:00.780
So, you do have quite a bit of latitude of
what you do.

01:35:00.780 --> 01:35:03.250
Now, you're probably not going to get that
program here because it is pretty expensive

01:35:03.250 --> 01:35:03.830
and pretty hard to do.

01:35:03.830 --> 01:35:07.990
But when you go out in industry or government
there is a very high probability you will

01:35:07.990 --> 01:35:09.930
be using some of these programs.

01:35:09.930 --> 01:35:15.670
And Johnson Space Center uses this one and
the Marshall Space Flight Center uses this

01:35:15.670 --> 01:35:16.130
one, CRH.

01:35:16.130 --> 01:35:23.130
There are two programs that are used by NASA,
I know, and they are becoming more and more

01:35:26.880 --> 01:35:28.400
important as we go ahead.

01:35:28.400 --> 01:35:35.400
Aaron, one thing you haven't discussed in
all this discussion of cost is margin.

01:35:36.770 --> 01:35:43.770
And, as a manager, you have to deal with that,
so maybe you can make a few comments on that.

01:35:43.770 --> 01:35:44.170
Sure.

01:35:44.170 --> 01:35:45.719
Well, let me start off this way.

01:35:45.719 --> 01:35:52.719
What Professor Hoffman is alluding to is that
when you create a budget you want to have

01:35:53.830 --> 01:35:59.500
some type of reserve or margin over and above
your cost estimate.

01:35:59.500 --> 01:36:01.650
And that takes care of several things.

01:36:01.650 --> 01:36:08.650
It takes care of changes, it takes care of
I forgots and it takes care of inefficiencies.

01:36:14.290 --> 01:36:21.290
Studies have found that in a high technology
program for the first time you are about 30%

01:36:24.719 --> 01:36:27.410
inefficient, so you are only about 70% efficient.

01:36:27.410 --> 01:36:30.800
Now, this was data that was taken some time
ago.

01:36:30.800 --> 01:36:37.800
You are 70% efficient, so you need to allow
some type of margin in that for your inefficiencies.

01:36:38.660 --> 01:36:45.550
If you do that and you talk about changes
and you talk about I forgots, your reserve

01:36:45.550 --> 01:36:46.130
becomes very high.

01:36:46.130 --> 01:36:52.120
And normally your boss, the guy that is over
you is not going to let you have that much

01:36:52.120 --> 01:36:57.620
money.

01:36:57.620 --> 01:37:03.469
One of the investigations we had on me during
the Shuttle Program, because my cost was growing,

01:37:03.469 --> 01:37:07.969
a very famous man came in to be head of the
program named General Abrahamson.

01:37:07.969 --> 01:37:11.150
Many of you may have heard of General Abrahamson.

01:37:11.150 --> 01:37:16.510
While he did the investigation, he said, Aaron,
you need a large reserve.

01:37:16.510 --> 01:37:19.320
He didn't know he was going to become manager
of the program.

01:37:19.320 --> 01:37:23.889
When he became manager of the program, I had
this large reserve in there, he was reviewing

01:37:23.889 --> 01:37:28.690
and said you cannot have that much reserve
so he wacked it down.

01:37:28.690 --> 01:37:34.330
But you do need a reserve because you're not
going to make it without a reserve.

01:37:34.330 --> 01:37:41.330
And, I don't know if you noticed or not but
in the papers I gave you on the cost of the

01:37:43.320 --> 01:37:47.360
Shuttle system, it had about a 30% reserve
in there.

01:37:47.360 --> 01:37:53.910
When I did the study for the 90-day study,
I had a 50% reserve in there because I felt

01:37:53.910 --> 01:38:00.770
that was a pretty far out program and you
needed a reserve.

01:38:00.770 --> 01:38:03.790
You need to fight for your reserve, but I
guaranty you're not going to get everything

01:38:03.790 --> 01:38:05.070
you think you need.

01:38:05.070 --> 01:38:05.550
Yes, sir.

01:38:05.550 --> 01:38:10.280
For something like aerospace, every time you
do a cost estimate, they talk about it, look

01:38:10.280 --> 01:38:15.400
at it and say, well, let's increase that by
50% or double it.

01:38:15.400 --> 01:38:19.040
And often, even once you've done that, you
still don't come under budget.

01:38:19.040 --> 01:38:26.040
I mean look at the ISS or the Airbus 380 that
is going out.

01:38:26.340 --> 01:38:26.590
Why?

01:38:26.530 --> 01:38:32.670
Well, again, it is really because -- First
of all, it is primarily for the inefficiencies.

01:38:32.670 --> 01:38:34.969
You just cannot do a high-tech program.

01:38:34.969 --> 01:38:41.130
Look at what it cost to do the Big Dig, to
drive it home.

01:38:41.130 --> 01:38:48.130
It is very difficult to do a good cost estimate,
but that is the problem that Congress sees

01:38:50.760 --> 01:38:56.420
with government programs today, both the Department
of Defense and NASA, that they cannot do a

01:38:56.420 --> 01:39:00.530
good cost estimate.

01:39:00.530 --> 01:39:06.710
The current program says they are going to
do the CEVing and go to the Moon for $104

01:39:06.710 --> 01:39:13.710
billion, which is 55% of what it cost to do
the Apollo Program in current year dollars.

01:39:15.610 --> 01:39:17.469
And that is going to be interesting to see
if they can do it.

01:39:17.469 --> 01:39:18.969
It is tough to do.

01:39:18.969 --> 01:39:21.650
But really I think the biggest problem is
your inefficiencies.

01:39:21.650 --> 01:39:28.650
Of course there are changes and I forgots.

01:39:30.170 --> 01:39:34.690
Interesting enough, though, you may or may
not believe this, and you probably won't but

01:39:34.690 --> 01:39:40.450
I will say it anyway, it turns out that the
studies done for the Shuttle Program, for

01:39:40.450 --> 01:39:47.450
the Orbiter actually, in real year dollars,
met the cost if we would have gotten the inflation

01:39:48.990 --> 01:39:50.370
rate.

01:39:50.370 --> 01:39:55.520
We lost the inflation for two years, which
Dale Myers fought for vigorously with OMB.

01:39:55.520 --> 01:40:01.660
If we would have gotten the inflation for
those two years, we would have met cost for

01:40:01.660 --> 01:40:02.680
the development cost.

01:40:02.680 --> 01:40:05.530
Not for the operational cost, but for the
development cost we would have come pretty

01:40:05.530 --> 01:40:06.889
close to it.

01:40:06.889 --> 01:40:08.930
We didn't really miss it that far.

01:40:08.930 --> 01:40:13.260
In Apollo, I'm not sure, you would need to
ask Dr.

01:40:13.260 --> 01:40:18.100
Siemens, but the story goes is that NASA came
in with an estimate.

01:40:18.100 --> 01:40:22.320
And at that time the administrator, Webb,
looked at it and said that is fine and he

01:40:22.320 --> 01:40:25.540
doubled it, and so Apollo did very well.

01:40:25.540 --> 01:40:28.750
I think Bob Siemens has told that.

01:40:28.750 --> 01:40:35.600
The story we heard was it was on their way
over to the White House that he said our final

01:40:35.600 --> 01:40:40.309
estimate, we've put all the factors and everything
in, is $10 billion.

01:40:40.309 --> 01:40:43.580
And Webb said, OK, we will tell the President
$20 billion.

01:40:43.580 --> 01:40:46.520
I am sure Bob Siemens would know.

01:40:46.520 --> 01:40:46.830
Yes, sir.

01:40:46.830 --> 01:40:52.130
Aaron, I wanted to ask you about the location
of the reserves.

01:40:52.130 --> 01:40:59.130
Not just dollar reserves, but my experience
as a payload [NOISE OBSCURES].

01:41:00.440 --> 01:41:07.440
The model I have been faced with is that the
mission manager has a reserve for crew time

01:41:11.920 --> 01:41:16.120
or for weight of something but, down on the
project level, you would really like to go

01:41:16.120 --> 01:41:17.780
and have your own.

01:41:17.780 --> 01:41:22.740
And so there was a tendency for everybody
but the lowest level, from the individual

01:41:22.740 --> 01:41:27.250
experiment up to say, well, I am going to
put in a little bit of pad rather than count

01:41:27.250 --> 01:41:32.150
on the fact that I can go up to the mission
manager and ask him for some reserve later.

01:41:32.150 --> 01:41:33.610
Well, that is the danger with that.

01:41:33.610 --> 01:41:34.660
You are absolutely right.

01:41:34.660 --> 01:41:36.120
Everybody would like to put their own reserve
in.

01:41:36.120 --> 01:41:42.710
Of course, being a project manager, I thought
the reserve ought to be at my level.

01:41:42.710 --> 01:41:49.710
But actually, John Yardley was my boss in
Washington, and he thought he should handle

01:41:50.800 --> 01:41:52.270
the reserve.

01:41:52.270 --> 01:41:56.840
And the subsystems managers wanted their reserve,
right?

01:41:56.840 --> 01:41:58.260
Wanted their reserve.

01:41:58.260 --> 01:42:02.760
And John Yardley was another person I should
have mentioned.

01:42:02.760 --> 01:42:07.630
John actually basically pulled the reserve
up and handled it in Washington.

01:42:07.630 --> 01:42:13.710
There is a certain efficiency, I assume, in
having all the reserves centralized so that

01:42:13.710 --> 01:42:17.800
there is not a lot of waste down to lower
levels, but you have to have the confidence

01:42:17.800 --> 01:42:20.070
that you are going to be able to draw on it.

01:42:20.070 --> 01:42:20.320
Right.

01:42:20.280 --> 01:42:24.809
And with that John would partial out some.

01:42:24.809 --> 01:42:31.340
What he would do is be sure that you weren't
double reserving him or triple reserving him.

01:42:31.340 --> 01:42:33.010
And then he would allocate it to me.

01:42:33.010 --> 01:42:34.880
I know he had a rule of thumb.

01:42:34.880 --> 01:42:41.880
When JR Thompson went up, you heard JR talk,
he always asked for more than he needed, so

01:42:45.740 --> 01:42:46.740
John would give him less.

01:42:46.740 --> 01:42:49.530
When I went up, I always asked for less than
I needed, so he would give me more.

01:42:49.530 --> 01:42:52.260
He had a good feel for his managers.

01:42:52.260 --> 01:42:59.100
That is what he told JR one day.

01:42:59.100 --> 01:43:01.020
Normally, you wind up handling it.

01:43:01.020 --> 01:43:04.980
If you have a good program manager at the
top you normally wind up handling it there

01:43:04.980 --> 01:43:08.120
and he parcels it out based on the fact there
is no double bookkeeping.

01:43:08.120 --> 01:43:08.719
Yes.

01:43:08.719 --> 01:43:15.719
My experience at Draper is typically there
are two different ways of estimating.

01:43:15.990 --> 01:43:18.670
One was called top down and the other was
bottoms up.

01:43:18.670 --> 01:43:25.670
And traditionally bottoms up would always
stick their reserve in some way and top down

01:43:26.100 --> 01:43:30.260
would always say I want to know what your
reserves are because I want to bring it up

01:43:30.260 --> 01:43:30.950
to the top.

01:43:30.950 --> 01:43:33.559
And that was a constant argument.

01:43:33.559 --> 01:43:40.260
Then when you got to submitting your proposal
often the customer didn't want to know about

01:43:40.260 --> 01:43:46.639
this extra money and then you would have to
shove it back in and hide it, in a sense,

01:43:46.639 --> 01:43:47.510
by padding things.

01:43:47.510 --> 01:43:54.290
Handling costing in reserves is, to some extent,
at least in my experience, a psychological

01:43:54.290 --> 01:43:57.820
thing dealing with customers and your management.

01:43:57.820 --> 01:44:02.920
And it has always been one where you shuffle
that reserve around.

01:44:02.920 --> 01:44:09.920
But this gentleman asked the question about
why does it appear that NASA never can stay

01:44:12.030 --> 01:44:12.740
on their budget?

01:44:12.740 --> 01:44:15.469
That is really a tough question to answer.

01:44:15.469 --> 01:44:16.700
I don't know.

01:44:16.700 --> 01:44:23.700
I mean I have a personal feeling on it, but
I think the basic problem you have is that

01:44:26.320 --> 01:44:29.590
it is a high technology program.

01:44:29.590 --> 01:44:35.880
It is one of a kind and it is a lot of inefficiencies.

01:44:35.880 --> 01:44:41.080
When you come to work every day, you don't
know exactly what you are going to do.

01:44:41.080 --> 01:44:42.969
You have a technology development that costs.

01:44:42.969 --> 01:44:43.930
You have I forgots.

01:44:43.930 --> 01:44:46.240
You have changing requirements.

01:44:46.240 --> 01:44:51.010
Changing requirements are something that systems
engineering ought to be able to control.

01:44:51.010 --> 01:44:55.520
I forgots are something systems engineering
ought to be able to control.

01:44:55.520 --> 01:44:58.900
Inefficiencies, to a certain extent, systems
engineering ought to be able to control.

01:44:58.900 --> 01:45:04.700
That is one of the purposes, in all honesty,
that are concentrating on system engineering

01:45:04.700 --> 01:45:11.360
at such places at MIT and other schools to
allow the future generation of designers and

01:45:11.360 --> 01:45:17.400
developers in working that they can have a
budget and then stay on the budget.

01:45:17.400 --> 01:45:23.639
Maybe in your generation you will be smarter
and able to control it, but it is not going

01:45:23.639 --> 01:45:24.610
to be an easy job.

01:45:24.610 --> 01:45:27.150
That is one thing I would say.

01:45:27.150 --> 01:45:30.280
Let me just make one other comment.

01:45:30.280 --> 01:45:32.389
We cannot estimate too much.

01:45:32.389 --> 01:45:39.389
That you've got to always keep in mind this
triangle of cost, performance, schedule.

01:45:39.639 --> 01:45:46.639
If you are working on a project where the
schedule is fixed like Apollo then that better

01:45:46.880 --> 01:45:51.580
ring the bells to say that I need more reserves.

01:45:51.580 --> 01:45:56.120
And maybe that is what was going on in Jim
Webb's mind when he said if we really have

01:45:56.120 --> 01:46:02.880
to get this done by the end of the decade,
I better make sure that I am not going to

01:46:02.880 --> 01:46:07.300
be constrained by cost and so I will double
it.

01:46:07.300 --> 01:46:14.190
The other thing that you have to take into
account with the performance is how much new

01:46:14.190 --> 01:46:16.500
technology is this program going to require?

01:46:16.500 --> 01:46:21.510
Because the new technology, that is the hardest
thing to estimate the cost.

01:46:21.510 --> 01:46:22.290
That's right.

01:46:22.290 --> 01:46:28.850
And so, if you have a new technology program
then your margins better be big enough to

01:46:28.850 --> 01:46:29.740
accommodate that.

01:46:29.740 --> 01:46:36.740
That is why, for the CEV, they are really
going out of their way to saying, to the maximum

01:46:37.680 --> 01:46:42.889
extent possible, we don't want to develop
new technology for the CEV.

01:46:42.889 --> 01:46:48.770
We want to use Shuttle parts wherever we can,
Apollo heritage.

01:46:48.770 --> 01:46:54.520
We want to build it out of things that we
know and we understand so that we hopefully

01:46:54.520 --> 01:46:59.130
can keep the cost as low as possible.

01:46:59.130 --> 01:47:00.610
And we will see how it all works out.

01:47:00.610 --> 01:47:00.860
Yes, sir.

01:47:00.790 --> 01:47:02.510
It seems to me that you often times have the
pressure to give a cost estimate on the low

01:47:02.510 --> 01:47:04.150
end of what you believe it to actual be just
so the project might be more appealing [NOISE

01:47:04.150 --> 01:47:04.400
OBSCURES].

01:47:04.240 --> 01:47:11.240
That is certainly another part of the

01:47:15.860 --> 01:47:17.010
whole political thing.

01:47:17.010 --> 01:47:22.880
And not just from the political point of view
of presenting your estimate when NASA presents

01:47:22.880 --> 01:47:29.380
the estimate to Congress, but then you have
the contractors who want to get the contract

01:47:29.380 --> 01:47:29.800
from NASA.

01:47:29.800 --> 01:47:31.820
And you have certainly had experience with
this.

01:47:31.820 --> 01:47:36.930
How do you deal with the contractor who low-balls
and then assumes that they will be able to

01:47:36.930 --> 01:47:38.650
make it up later on?

01:47:38.650 --> 01:47:43.530
Low-balling really should not be tolerated.

01:47:43.530 --> 01:47:47.780
And they try to do that, not tolerating it,
but you are absolutely right.

01:47:47.780 --> 01:47:52.550
When I did this 90-day study, I really felt
they wanted to know what it was going to cost,

01:47:52.550 --> 01:47:56.990
so I had a 55% reserve in there because I
really felt that there were so many unknowns

01:47:56.990 --> 01:47:57.469
with it.

01:47:57.469 --> 01:47:58.860
And, of course, that didn't go over very well.

01:47:58.860 --> 01:48:02.510
They said my study actually killed the projects.

01:48:02.510 --> 01:48:05.410
But I told them what it was going to cost.

01:48:05.410 --> 01:48:12.410
And then this is a subject for another lecture
entirely, which I am not sure that we are

01:48:12.860 --> 01:48:18.630
going to do in this course, but there are
many different ways to let out contracts,

01:48:18.630 --> 01:48:23.480
fixed price contracts, cost plus contracts,
award contracts.

01:48:23.480 --> 01:48:30.480
And all of those can have an impact on the
ultimate cost of your project.

01:48:30.900 --> 01:48:37.900
And they all have their utility depending
on how well the technology is known and what

01:48:40.300 --> 01:48:42.130
is the time pressure.

01:48:42.130 --> 01:48:45.270
Again, cost, performance, schedule.

01:48:45.270 --> 01:48:49.910
And you asked about Airbus.

01:48:49.910 --> 01:48:54.170
I don't know the specifics of Airbus contracting,
but I am familiar with ESA.

01:48:54.170 --> 01:48:59.219
And, because of some of the peculiarities
of the European system, they tend to use fixed

01:48:59.219 --> 01:49:04.530
price contracts a lot more than we do here.

01:49:04.530 --> 01:49:10.389
And sometimes it works but sometimes you get
really burned on it because contractors are

01:49:10.389 --> 01:49:16.389
not going to go into bankruptcy because they
cannot deliver on their fixed price contracts.

01:49:16.389 --> 01:49:19.719
You try to go fixed price on the CEV and it
would cost you a fortune.

01:49:19.719 --> 01:49:23.400
Those are very good questions.

01:49:23.400 --> 01:49:27.200
Unfortunately, we don't give you very firm
answers on cost.

01:49:27.200 --> 01:49:30.990
But at least you are thinking and I appreciate
your thought process.

01:49:30.990 --> 01:49:35.760
It is very encouraging to hear you ask those
types of questions.

01:49:35.760 --> 01:49:36.450
Have a good weekend.

01:49:36.450 --> 01:49:37.700
We will see you on Tuesday.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:31.990
PROFESSOR: We continue
this wee, next week,

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:35.440
with our conversation-- it's
really our final conversation--

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.210
about the genre forms that are
at the center of the Hollywood

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.830
era with a consideration
of the Western.

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.690
And that perhaps we should
begin by acknowledging

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:48.620
how central the
Western is as a movie

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.320
form in the history
of American cinema.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.750
Before the advent of
television in the late '40s--

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.210
the first American television
broadcast was 1946.

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.110
And we can say the
television is actually

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.470
established is a social
experience in American life

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.460
certainly by the late '40s,
by let's say 1949 or 1950.

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.200
And it's through the
'50s that television

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.960
spreads through the society and
begins to supplant the movies.

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.500
So that before
television, let's say

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.750
that before 1950,
nearly 30% percent

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:22.860
of every movie made
in the United States

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.130
was a Western all the way
through the Hollywood era.

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:33.480
And in fact, in the silent
era, as I will describe briefly

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:37.490
again this evening when I
do a kind of mini history

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.610
of the Western movie,
even in the silent era,

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:42.720
it's a central form.

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.210
And even after the 1950s, even
after the advent of television,

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.160
nearly half of
all movies that we

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.280
might identify as set in the
past, as historical movies,

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.764
were Westerns.

00:01:59.764 --> 00:02:01.180
And of course, as
I suggested when

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.750
I talked about the
musical, the Western

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.759
can be understood along with the
musical as a uniquely American

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.750
form, even though
at a certain point

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.180
in the mid and late '1960s,
certain gifted Italian

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.180
directors begin to
take over the Western

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.690
and darken it and throw a
kind of European cynicism

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.790
into the tradition
of the Western.

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.880
By that time, the Western
genre evolved and transformed

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.900
in ways that made this cynicism
not completely unique, not

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.780
totally European, because a
kind of subversive perspective

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.800
had begun to enter the American
version of the Western as well.

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.700
Nonetheless, the
Western form underwent

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.180
profound transformations.

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:45.890
And it's those
transformations that I

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.780
want to briefly to talk about
here in an introductory way.

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.520
And I'll return to
that sort of what

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.860
we might call the
trajectory or the career

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.630
of the Western briefly this
evening when I introduce

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:02.290
some comments I want
to make about John Ford

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.750
and about his classic Western,
the film we're watching

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.130
tonight, "The Searchers."

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:10.260
I want to talk a
little bit more,

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.860
not only about the Western,
but about why the Western might

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.390
be seen as being the
central American form,

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:20.910
why it is so central not only to
the History of American cinema,

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.630
but in a certain sense,
central to the cultural history

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.340
of American society.

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.550
One way to see
this is to reframe

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:31.800
the idea I've been suggesting
all through the term

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.650
this notion that
at a certain point,

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:37.970
the movies became a form
of central storytelling

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.870
in the society, the
form of storytelling

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:45.300
that more Americans
than any other form

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:49.240
participated in and
experienced, a form that I've

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.810
come to label
consensus narrative,

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.860
a kind of story system that
appeals across social barriers

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:00.450
and across age that intends
in some sense to express what

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:03.190
might be called the dominant
or the central values

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:04.160
of a society.

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:08.410
We talked about this idea--
I've talked about this idea

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:10.020
already at some
length and I don't

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:11.690
want to spend too
much time on it here.

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:14.770
But I want to complicate
those ideas one more

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:20.240
time by reminding you that one
way to think about or one way

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:25.105
to frame this notion that the
movies and the Western form

00:04:25.105 --> 00:04:30.030
in particular embody this
notion of a story form that

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:32.190
tends to reach the whole
society or to speak

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:33.950
for the whole
society or to embody

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:36.430
the central values
of the whole society

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:39.100
is one way of understanding
the implications of that

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:45.780
is to recognize, first of all,
that the Hollywood system which

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:49.460
is so committed to forms
of genre representation

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:57.200
is particularly served by the
principles of repetition that

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:01.260
are inherent in the conventions
that surround the Western.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.470
Even the Western-- the
content of Westerns

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:05.510
or the attitudes
within Westerns might

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:09.420
undergo great transformations,
the basic formulas

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:11.830
remain recognizable
from the earliest days.

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:16.000
We think about the costumes, the
horses, the guns, and so forth,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.870
and even certain basic
plots and subplots that

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:21.700
keep returning in the Western.

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:27.160
As with the musical,
the genre is so robust

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.040
that it has many
sort of some sub

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:32.030
within it so that one
can talk about Westerns

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:36.910
that involve battles between
sheep herders and ranchers.

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:39.290
Or one can talk
about the Westerns

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:41.390
that are so focused
on the laying

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:43.270
of the transcontinental
railroad.

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:46.650
Or one could focus on
Westerns that focus

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:49.290
on the conflict between
white settlers and Indians.

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:51.720
Now, many Westerns combine
a number of these elements.

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:56.150
And there are other sub
genres we could describe.

00:05:56.150 --> 00:06:01.530
The very fact that there
are these sub genres

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:06.290
is a measure of how
robust the system became.

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:09.440
And one way to think, therefore,
about this idea that I've

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:13.924
labeled, consensus
narrative, or another way

00:06:13.924 --> 00:06:15.840
to think about what I've
earlier in the course

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:18.210
called the cultural
work of the movies

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:21.190
or the cultural, the
anthropological job,

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:24.970
that genre forms in general
during the Hollywood era

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:29.650
perform, is to recognize
that we can understand

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:31.700
the specific genre
as a distilled

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:34.360
instance of the larger
process of the movies,

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:37.660
right, as a smaller
clarifying instance,

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:40.780
we can understand
in a certain sense

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:44.870
as a forum, a space
of conversation,

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:48.270
a space of discourse in
which the culture engages

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:50.900
in a kind of ongoing
conversation.

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:52.920
You remember the terms
I used earlier borrowing

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:55.260
from the English critic
Raymond Williams.

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:59.500
I said that we can understand
that these genre reforms

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:02.790
or these consensus forms
could be said to mobilize

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:05.100
three different
strains of attitude--

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:09.320
an emergent, a dominant, and
a traditional set of voices--

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:11.580
and that one of the
explanations for why

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:14.120
genre texts and the
Hollywood movie specifically

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:17.530
and the Western in particular
are often so conflicted

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:20.000
or divided is precisely
that they embody

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.580
or incorporate
some attitudes that

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:26.100
are traditional and old
fashioned, some attitudes that

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:29.990
are emerging and challenge
traditional ideas,

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:33.250
and also what we might
central or dominant values,

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:36.010
and that not every text
will balance those elements

00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:37.710
in exactly the same way.

00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:39.780
The second point about
this is to recognize

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:42.310
that one of the beauties of
genre, one of the reasons

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:45.710
they serve such a fundamental
cultural or anthropological

00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:48.690
function in a
society, is precisely

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:51.490
that they go on forever,
that in other words

00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:55.060
we can think of genre forms as
a kind of ongoing continuing

00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:57.780
conversation centered
on the same formats

00:07:57.780 --> 00:07:59.130
and the same conventions.

00:07:59.130 --> 00:08:04.830
And if the genre is stable
and if the society produces

00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:08.150
these genre forms over
decades, the genre

00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:14.080
form itself becomes a
mirror in which we can see

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:18.220
reflected the changing values
and assumptions of the culture.

00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:23.440
Now, this might be true of
any kind of a particular genre

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:25.300
form in any medium.

00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:27.640
But the reason it has
special force when

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:30.280
we're talking about the
movies in the 20th century

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:31.870
in the United
States is precisely

00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:35.280
because the form is so
central to the society,

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:37.840
because so much of the
society participates in it.

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:39.380
So the picture of
the society that

00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:43.090
is the ambivalent and conflicted
picture of the society that

00:08:43.090 --> 00:08:46.170
emerges from studying
these genre forms

00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:48.900
is likely to be far more
illuminating about the larger

00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:54.190
culture than, let's say, a study
of a cultural form, let's say,

00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:55.900
like opera.

00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:58.470
Not that the opera isn't worth
studying and doesn't reflect

00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:01.700
certain cultural values too,
but because the opera appeals

00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:04.210
to a particular
subculture, the values

00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:06.050
are going to be narrower.

00:09:06.050 --> 00:09:09.660
The kinds of assumptions
the people writing opera

00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:12.260
and attending opera make about
the larger culture and about

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.820
aesthetic experience
are profoundly

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:18.470
different from the
much more dispersed

00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:23.150
and democratic attitudes
and accessible notions

00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:28.425
that animate the create
of a consensus form,

00:09:28.425 --> 00:09:32.030
of a form that's trying to
reach the whole of a culture.

00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:35.000
So this is a way
of reminding you

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.910
of what we might call
the sociological and

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:40.980
anthropological importance
of the study of popular forms

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:42.620
in general and of
American movies

00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:47.080
in particular, the Western
genre even more especially.

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:52.140
We can think, therefore,
of the Western almost

00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:55.880
as a form of kind of national
theater, a kind of repertory

00:09:55.880 --> 00:10:00.430
company in which the same
relatively small number,

00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:03.530
recognizably small number,
of actors and actresses,

00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:07.710
of directors and other sub
specialists whose names are

00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:13.620
never remembered, collaborate
to create the film.

00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:17.210
We can think of the
movies as embodying,

00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:23.220
in a certain sense,
what I'm calling

00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:25.080
the theater of a nation.

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:27.030
And I put the phrase
in quotation marks

00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:29.274
not because it's a fancy
phrase, but because I

00:10:29.274 --> 00:10:30.690
want to call
attention to the fact

00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:32.820
that I'm actually
borrowing a phrase

00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:35.420
from a great literary
historian who

00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:37.644
wrote a book about
Shakespeare's audience

00:10:37.644 --> 00:10:40.060
and about Shakespeare's plays
and about the public theater

00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:45.330
of Shakespeare's day and
called that theater the theater

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:46.620
of a nation.

00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:49.990
And in a certain sense, we could
say that the Hollywood system

00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:53.000
was a similar kind of theater.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.350
It doesn't from this
that every text created

00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:57.620
there is a noble work of art.

00:10:57.620 --> 00:10:59.670
And it's very
important to recognize

00:10:59.670 --> 00:11:01.380
that the distinction
I'm making between

00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:05.020
and anthropological
perspective and an artistic one

00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:07.200
must hold here.

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:09.556
And it's another reason
for emphasizing this.

00:11:09.556 --> 00:11:10.930
Because the fact
of the matter is

00:11:10.930 --> 00:11:12.950
it's very hard in
a course like this,

00:11:12.950 --> 00:11:15.390
especially-- because some of
these films are so wonderful,

00:11:15.390 --> 00:11:18.390
my own enthusiasm
encourages you to like them

00:11:18.390 --> 00:11:19.580
and I want you to like them.

00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:21.454
Nonetheless, it's very
important to recognize

00:11:21.454 --> 00:11:25.140
that I'm not trying to tell
you a merely triumphalist story

00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:29.200
about how magnificently
American movies began

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:31.100
to sort of realize
their possibilities

00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:33.310
and dramatize experience.

00:11:33.310 --> 00:11:35.810
Because in a certain
fundamental sense,

00:11:35.810 --> 00:11:39.200
these consensus values are
not necessarily noble ones.

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:41.200
And the western is a
particularly clear instance

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:41.699
of this.

00:11:41.699 --> 00:11:43.730
And what I'm talking
about in a certain sense

00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:46.260
is the extent to which
these genre reforms carry

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:51.540
the lies, the prejudices, the
nasty qualities of a society

00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:54.280
as well as their
ideals and values.

00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:57.330
And we can feel those
elements, even though the films

00:11:57.330 --> 00:12:00.260
themselves want to
tell uplifting stories,

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:03.410
the values embedded in them may
not be so attractive at all.

00:12:03.410 --> 00:12:05.640
And the Western is a
particularly clear instance

00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:08.770
of this-- a reminder,
again, that we don't just

00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:11.650
look at films for
aesthetic satisfaction.

00:12:11.650 --> 00:12:13.460
We don't just look
at films for-- we

00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:16.120
don't need to just look at
films for mere enjoyment.

00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:19.860
They are anthropological
artifacts

00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:25.470
of the greatest importance
exactly because they existed

00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:30.296
at such a central, at such a
fundamental space in the larger

00:12:30.296 --> 00:12:30.795
society.

00:12:34.030 --> 00:12:37.240
Why would the Western--
why would the Western

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:38.650
be such a central form?

00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:41.510
Why, in some sense, could
we think of the movies,

00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:44.090
with its vast,
wide, giant screen,

00:12:44.090 --> 00:12:46.900
as the ultimate
destiny of the Western?

00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:49.794
I think one explanation for
the power of the Western film,

00:12:49.794 --> 00:12:51.210
because there were
Western stories

00:12:51.210 --> 00:12:53.860
and other Western formats
before the advent of film--

00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:55.980
and I'll talk about
them in a moment.

00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:59.042
Why would the film be such a
decisive space for the Western?

00:12:59.042 --> 00:13:01.000
And I think if you think
about it for a moment,

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.530
you'll recognize instantly
why that is the case.

00:13:03.530 --> 00:13:06.890
The format of the
movies is particularly

00:13:06.890 --> 00:13:10.300
conducive to the sense of
grandeur and largeness,

00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:13.010
spaciousness, that's
characteristic of Western

00:13:13.010 --> 00:13:22.920
spaces and of the parables
of heroism and social create,

00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:25.430
society creation,
so the equation

00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:29.480
of a particular culture or
environment in the wilderness,

00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:32.750
the establishment of
civilization as a recurring

00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:33.870
theme in the western.

00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:37.830
This kind of
recurring subject is

00:13:37.830 --> 00:13:42.660
at the very heart of
what Westerns do and turn

00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:46.760
the movies, I think, into
a particularly appropriate

00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:49.800
environment for the
largeness and grandeur

00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:52.520
that Westerns represent.

00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:54.900
But that itself isn't
quite enough to explain

00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:57.970
why the Westerns occupy
such a central place.

00:13:57.970 --> 00:14:00.420
And of course, there are
historical and cultural

00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:02.000
explanations as well.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.810
The first explanation
is that the movies

00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:06.660
are born at the end of a
period in which we could say

00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:08.350
the real west actually existed.

00:14:08.350 --> 00:14:10.200
In other words, the
movies come in just

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:12.940
at the moment-- the
movies actually are still

00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:17.130
around when the experience
of what we call the West

00:14:17.130 --> 00:14:21.630
was still historically actual.

00:14:21.630 --> 00:14:23.900
It wasn't quite in the past.

00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:28.120
The Western genre
is focused really

00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:32.150
on a 30 year period, that
what some critics have

00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:35.790
called the real west, in
the period from about 1860

00:14:35.790 --> 00:14:38.900
through 1890.

00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:42.990
And this is the period of the
Civil War, of a whole variety

00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:46.810
of Indian wars, of the laying of
the transcontinental railroad,

00:14:46.810 --> 00:14:51.190
of the California and
Dakota gold rushes,

00:14:51.190 --> 00:14:54.490
the period of the range wars
I mentioned a little while ago

00:14:54.490 --> 00:14:57.230
between settlers and
great ranchers who

00:14:57.230 --> 00:14:59.920
wanted to keep spaces
open for their cattle.

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:03.000
And of course, we now
realize it's the period,

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.830
although the early Westerns
didn't want to acknowledge this

00:15:05.830 --> 00:15:09.540
and told a kind
of opposite, it's

00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:12.400
also of course the era
in which we exterminate,

00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:15.640
virtually-- the era of genocide
against Native Americans,

00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:19.610
the extermination of Indians
and of the Buffalo that

00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:22.600
roamed the Western plains.

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:26.570
And before this real
west moment was over,

00:15:26.570 --> 00:15:32.350
even before it
became history, it

00:15:32.350 --> 00:15:35.180
had begun to be mythologized.

00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:37.620
It was mythologized
in the popular culture

00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:40.710
simultaneously with
its actual existence.

00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:45.430
And there were a whole series
of forms of publication

00:15:45.430 --> 00:15:49.090
and forms of drama that
drew on the west and stories

00:15:49.090 --> 00:15:52.640
of the west and begin to
establish what we might call

00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:56.490
the basic conventions
of the Western mythology

00:15:56.490 --> 00:16:01.130
or the parable America
likes to tell itself

00:16:01.130 --> 00:16:03.740
about the nature of
the settling the West.

00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:06.920
One of these forms
were the dime novels

00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:10.510
that appeared in the
late 19th century

00:16:10.510 --> 00:16:15.570
and into the early 20th century,
available usually in paperback

00:16:15.570 --> 00:16:17.800
at news stands.

00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:19.855
And some of them were
immensely popular.

00:16:23.290 --> 00:16:26.490
Here's one title,
a very famous one,

00:16:26.490 --> 00:16:28.910
the equivalent of a
best seller, I guess,

00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:32.580
of the day published in
1882-- The Life, Times,

00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:36.820
and Treacherous Death
of Jesse James, 1882.

00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:39.860
And of course, what
these dime novels

00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:42.230
did was they took what were
quasi historical events,

00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:45.780
sometimes real events, and
immensely elaborated them,

00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:49.330
fictionized them into heroic
fables of various kinds,

00:16:49.330 --> 00:16:52.290
often celebrating people
like Jesse James who

00:16:52.290 --> 00:16:55.090
may well have been outlaws
and disreputable people

00:16:55.090 --> 00:16:57.330
in actuality.

00:16:57.330 --> 00:17:02.000
Another title-- The Illustrated
Lives and Adventures

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.240
of Frank and Jesse James
and the Younger Brothers.

00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:11.849
And you can imagine what that
kind of thing would have done.

00:17:11.849 --> 00:17:14.020
In addition to
these dime novels,

00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:17.410
there will also stage
performances, plays.

00:17:17.410 --> 00:17:21.859
They were often some form of
melodrama set in the Old West

00:17:21.859 --> 00:17:27.730
and involving the basic costumes
and accoutrements of a Western,

00:17:27.730 --> 00:17:28.250
right?

00:17:28.250 --> 00:17:31.810
Pistols and cowboy hats and
school marms from the east

00:17:31.810 --> 00:17:32.900
and so forth.

00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:35.630
But perhaps even more important
than these two sources,

00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:37.820
and they were very powerful
and important forms

00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:40.910
of popular culture before films
to help establish what we might

00:17:40.910 --> 00:17:44.430
call the mythology of the west,
were the Buffalo Bill shows,

00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:46.450
the wild west shows.

00:17:46.450 --> 00:17:49.640
These were unbelievably
popular and successful.

00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:54.770
Here is a picture
of a kind of flyer

00:17:54.770 --> 00:17:57.300
that would be distributed
in small towns

00:17:57.300 --> 00:17:59.970
or sometimes in larger
towns as the Wild West show

00:17:59.970 --> 00:18:03.690
and-- the Wild West
show came to town.

00:18:03.690 --> 00:18:08.480
The star of the Wild West show
was William Cody, Buffalo Bill.

00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:12.440
He had a very modest
actual career in the west.

00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:15.550
But it was immensely elaborated
by him and his publicist

00:18:15.550 --> 00:18:18.720
into something much grander
and more remarkable.

00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:22.660
Buffalo Bill made his first
age appearance in 1872

00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:26.640
in a stage melodrama called
"Scout of the Planes,"

00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:28.710
which went on a two
year four, right?

00:18:28.710 --> 00:18:31.220
And then in 1882,
10 years later,

00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:33.610
he formed his own
wild west show, which

00:18:33.610 --> 00:18:36.221
became immensely popular,
traveled all over the country,

00:18:36.221 --> 00:18:37.470
and then made trips to Europe.

00:18:37.470 --> 00:18:43.290
He even did one Wild West show
before the Queen of England.

00:18:43.290 --> 00:18:48.820
And it was an immensely
successful public enactment.

00:18:48.820 --> 00:18:51.820
The basic elements
of the wild west show

00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:54.250
contained the essential
mythology that

00:18:54.250 --> 00:18:56.690
then moved into the movies.

00:18:56.690 --> 00:19:00.170
They often dramatized--
in the wild west show,

00:19:00.170 --> 00:19:02.605
they often dramatize a
battle between white men

00:19:02.605 --> 00:19:05.250
and Indians in which the
Indians were very treacherous

00:19:05.250 --> 00:19:07.110
and were finally defeated.

00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:10.840
They sometimes, in fact, in some
of the forms of the wild west

00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:13.401
show, they reenacted the
Battle of Little Bighorn

00:19:13.401 --> 00:19:15.400
in which at the last
minute, there was a rescue.

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:18.200
They reversed history
in it sometimes

00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:22.830
in order to dramatize
an outcome that

00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:24.885
was more appealing to
the white audiences.

00:19:27.730 --> 00:19:29.640
The wild west show
staged battles

00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:31.040
between cowboys and Indians.

00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:34.230
And in fact, one of the
great historical ironies,

00:19:34.230 --> 00:19:36.780
the historical irony
that the director we're

00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:38.290
looking at next
week, Robert Altman,

00:19:38.290 --> 00:19:40.440
actually picks up on in
one of his films called

00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:44.070
"Buffalo Bill and the Indians,"
a film he made in the 1970s--

00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:46.320
1975, I think.

00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:49.320
One of the shocking things
is that at a certain point,

00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:51.240
at least for two
years, I think, one

00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:56.040
of the participants
in the Wild West shows

00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:58.920
was Sitting Bull himself,
the defeated Indian,

00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:04.950
the defeated Native American
leader who was now domesticated

00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:07.080
and actually became
part of the show.

00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:10.840
And in Altman's fictionalized
version of this episode,

00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:13.700
a drunken Paul Newman
plays Buffalo Bill.

00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:16.660
And he's mocked and made
fun of in some sense

00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:21.770
by a character who represents
Chief Sitting Bull, who

00:20:21.770 --> 00:20:24.580
has all the dignity-- he's
almost the only character

00:20:24.580 --> 00:20:26.700
in the film with real dignity.

00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:32.860
It's a subversive post
Hollywood era Western,

00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:33.960
as you might guess.

00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:37.470
So the Wild West shows, the
Buffalo Bill wild west shows,

00:20:37.470 --> 00:20:39.260
were essentially
an early rehearsal

00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:40.672
for what the movies became.

00:20:40.672 --> 00:20:42.380
And many of the elements
of the wild west

00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:45.470
show-- fancy roping,
fancy shooting,

00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:51.600
conflicts between cowboys
and Indians, the performance

00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:55.710
of various horse riding
tricks, herding of cattle

00:20:55.710 --> 00:20:58.660
and so forth-- all sort of
contained the elements that

00:20:58.660 --> 00:21:00.910
then moved into the
movies in an even more

00:21:00.910 --> 00:21:03.440
systematic and powerful way.

00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:05.610
And then I might mention
one final source--

00:21:05.610 --> 00:21:07.380
the novel itself.

00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:10.210
At the beginning of
the 20th century,

00:21:10.210 --> 00:21:13.452
in 1902, one of the best selling
novels of all time in English

00:21:13.452 --> 00:21:14.035
was published.

00:21:14.035 --> 00:21:16.510
It was a book
called The Virginian

00:21:16.510 --> 00:21:18.310
by a writer named
Owen Worcester.

00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:20.020
And it remains one
of the bestselling

00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:21.910
books in the history
of the United States.

00:21:21.910 --> 00:21:24.970
It still sells thousands
of books every year.

00:21:24.970 --> 00:21:27.210
I once found, in
a used bookstore,

00:21:27.210 --> 00:21:30.150
an addition of
The Virginian that

00:21:30.150 --> 00:21:32.250
had been published
I think 15 years

00:21:32.250 --> 00:21:34.050
after its original publication.

00:21:34.050 --> 00:21:39.210
And that addition was, I think,
the 50th addition of the book.

00:21:39.210 --> 00:21:41.590
It went through an incredible
number of-- and in fact,

00:21:41.590 --> 00:21:45.350
the addition I had also included
beautiful illustrations that

00:21:45.350 --> 00:21:48.760
obviously were added
to later additions

00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:51.520
once the popularity of
the book became known.

00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:54.320
So what we find is that
the popular culture

00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:57.660
before the advent of movies
had already, in some sense,

00:21:57.660 --> 00:22:00.130
created a full fledged
mythology of the Western,

00:22:00.130 --> 00:22:04.690
had familiarized the society
with the basic attitudes,

00:22:04.690 --> 00:22:09.230
assumptions, costumes,
and fundamental archetypal

00:22:09.230 --> 00:22:12.930
characters who
organize the Western.

00:22:12.930 --> 00:22:14.811
And there's one further
thing to emphasize.

00:22:14.811 --> 00:22:16.310
This may be the
most important thing

00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:19.030
of all, what we might call
the intellectual culture.

00:22:19.030 --> 00:22:22.740
It was-- not only was there
a real historical background

00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:24.790
to the Western and
not only was there

00:22:24.790 --> 00:22:29.140
a profound form of popular
culture in theater,

00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:32.390
in public performances,
like these wild west shows,

00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:35.910
and in dime novels as well
as in literary novels--

00:22:35.910 --> 00:22:39.290
a tremendous
compost of discourse

00:22:39.290 --> 00:22:41.680
that already sort of
establishes the genre even

00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:43.350
before the movies arrive.

00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:44.890
There was also a final touch.

00:22:44.890 --> 00:22:48.550
And this is the thing that
helps to explain, I think,

00:22:48.550 --> 00:22:51.060
maybe more powerfully than the
other examples I've given you

00:22:51.060 --> 00:22:54.850
why the Western had such a
hold and continues in some ways

00:22:54.850 --> 00:22:58.840
to have such a vestigial hold
on the American imagination

00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:01.740
and on America's
sense of itself.

00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:04.410
And that is what happens
in what I call here

00:23:04.410 --> 00:23:06.320
the intellectual culture.

00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:10.550
In 1893, one of the most famous
historians, Frederick Jackson

00:23:10.550 --> 00:23:17.960
Turner, published an essay in
the American Historical Soci--

00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:20.700
or delivered a lecture
and then it was later

00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:22.360
published as an
essay-- delivered

00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:25.400
a lecture to the American
Historical Society.

00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:27.760
And the title of the essay
was "The Significance

00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:29.850
of the Frontier in
American History."

00:23:29.850 --> 00:23:33.380
it's probably the single most
influential historical essay

00:23:33.380 --> 00:23:36.040
about the American past.

00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:39.500
It's been attacked and
undermined and qualified

00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:43.020
and its limitations have
been widely discussed

00:23:43.020 --> 00:23:45.010
over the last 25 years.

00:23:45.010 --> 00:23:48.820
But it still remains, in some
respects, a seminal essay,

00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:51.640
even when historians are
reacting against it-- one

00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:55.660
of the most important central
essays about the nature

00:23:55.660 --> 00:23:57.440
of American culture.

00:23:57.440 --> 00:24:00.940
And this article-- in this
article, Frederick Jackson

00:24:00.940 --> 00:24:04.490
Turner argued
essentially that-- he

00:24:04.490 --> 00:24:06.140
was trying to make
a case for what

00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:07.770
makes the United States unique.

00:24:07.770 --> 00:24:09.450
He was making a
case for what we now

00:24:09.450 --> 00:24:13.030
call American exceptionalism,
a dubious proposition.

00:24:13.030 --> 00:24:15.250
But let's listen
to his argument,

00:24:15.250 --> 00:24:17.980
which has a good deal
of power and interest.

00:24:17.980 --> 00:24:19.880
He said essentially
that the existence

00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:25.170
of free land, of a continuously
receding settlement,

00:24:25.170 --> 00:24:29.970
of a continuously receding
frontier, the advance

00:24:29.970 --> 00:24:33.060
of settlement westward
with European settlers

00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:35.150
always pressing
against that frontier,

00:24:35.150 --> 00:24:38.870
that the existence of such
a reality in American life

00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:42.870
had altered inherited notions
of social class and aristocratic

00:24:42.870 --> 00:24:47.880
government and had created a
tendency toward what Turner

00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:50.740
implied were or said
were the American ideals

00:24:50.740 --> 00:24:53.800
of individualism
and classlessness,

00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:54.980
of democracy itself.

00:24:54.980 --> 00:24:56.420
In other words,
the United States,

00:24:56.420 --> 00:25:00.010
according to Turner's
argument, had

00:25:00.010 --> 00:25:02.520
a particularly open
and democratic feel

00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:06.120
because the existence of
this frontier allowed people

00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:11.570
to escape into a new life,
to find possibilities,

00:25:11.570 --> 00:25:14.280
to escape the confinements
of social class,

00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:16.850
even perhaps in some
small degree of gender,

00:25:16.850 --> 00:25:19.370
although feminist
historians have certainly

00:25:19.370 --> 00:25:24.010
shown how confining the life of
women in the west actually was.

00:25:24.010 --> 00:25:27.670
Nonetheless, a sense that
the existence of the frontier

00:25:27.670 --> 00:25:31.820
made the United States a
uniquely individualistic

00:25:31.820 --> 00:25:33.800
and a uniquely free society.

00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:35.590
What Turner had
done, of course, was

00:25:35.590 --> 00:25:39.070
define a central historical
myth for European Americans,

00:25:39.070 --> 00:25:41.880
for the white society
in the United States.

00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:46.220
And we've come to recognize that
limitations of the argument.

00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:48.290
What's the most profound,
obvious limitation

00:25:48.290 --> 00:25:50.840
that occurs to you instantly?

00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:53.316
How about the people
who already here, right?

00:25:53.316 --> 00:25:54.690
In other words,
one of the things

00:25:54.690 --> 00:25:57.320
that's wrong with
the Turner thesis

00:25:57.320 --> 00:25:59.160
is that it's oblivious
to the existence

00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:02.230
of the Native Americans
who were pushed aside

00:26:02.230 --> 00:26:03.480
by the white settlers.

00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:06.240
It's a very complex story and I
don't want to oversimplify it.

00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:09.480
I don't mean that the
heroic white people who

00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:11.430
got in the Conestoga
wagons and who

00:26:11.430 --> 00:26:13.090
settled the west,
about whom there

00:26:13.090 --> 00:26:17.580
are dozens if not hundreds if
not thousands of-- certainly

00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:20.970
thousands if we count stories
in all formats-- of movies

00:26:20.970 --> 00:26:24.054
and books and short stories
and plays and so forth.

00:26:24.054 --> 00:26:25.470
I don't want to
suggest that there

00:26:25.470 --> 00:26:29.511
was nothing heroic or
remarkable about that behavior.

00:26:29.511 --> 00:26:30.010
There was.

00:26:30.010 --> 00:26:32.820
The United States is not
wrong-- American culture is not

00:26:32.820 --> 00:26:36.340
wrong in some sense to celebrate
the heroism of those people.

00:26:36.340 --> 00:26:38.540
But of course, as
we've come to realize,

00:26:38.540 --> 00:26:43.130
and as many of our most recent
Westerns openly acknowledge,

00:26:43.130 --> 00:26:46.840
this original mythology
which sort of celebrated

00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:50.450
unambiguously the white
settlement of the West

00:26:50.450 --> 00:26:53.210
was actually also in
some sense an invasion

00:26:53.210 --> 00:26:54.890
and even a genocide.

00:26:54.890 --> 00:26:58.030
And the Turner thesis
doesn't even imagine that.

00:26:58.030 --> 00:27:00.440
It sees it as a
triumphal reality.

00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:02.860
So there were limits, terrible
limits, to the argument.

00:27:02.860 --> 00:27:05.270
But there's also something
profoundly helpful

00:27:05.270 --> 00:27:06.360
about the argument.

00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:08.330
There is a sense
of spaciousness,

00:27:08.330 --> 00:27:11.940
a sense of new possibilities,
a greater hostility

00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:15.319
to social class and inherited
wealth in the United States

00:27:15.319 --> 00:27:16.610
than there are in other places.

00:27:16.610 --> 00:27:19.490
And for both good and
ill, the United States

00:27:19.490 --> 00:27:21.840
celebrates forms
of individualism

00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:25.950
as against communal behavior
with a kind of intensity

00:27:25.950 --> 00:27:29.750
and compelling power that
many, many, not just Europeans,

00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:33.280
that many, many non Americans
think is excessive and think

00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:36.960
has been reflected in some
sense in various forms

00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:41.810
of national behavior which we
needn't discuss in detail now.

00:27:41.810 --> 00:27:46.100
But you could all imagine
your own examples.

00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:48.040
But to come back to
the primary point,

00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:51.290
then, one of the reasons that--
it's as if the movies were sort

00:27:51.290 --> 00:27:54.560
of waiting for the Western,
as if the Western form already

00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:58.740
in some sense, in fundamental
ways, fully formed

00:27:58.740 --> 00:28:03.000
comes into the movies just
as the movies are born,

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:06.110
as if the format of the movies
and the content of the Western

00:28:06.110 --> 00:28:08.040
were made for each
other in some sense.

00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:11.050
And it becomes one of the
dominant, one of the signature

00:28:11.050 --> 00:28:13.660
features of American cinema.

00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:16.510
One of the fundamental aspects
of what the Western is,

00:28:16.510 --> 00:28:19.740
if we think of it as a
kind of cultural mythology,

00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:22.820
is that it tells
a founding story.

00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:24.990
It tells the story
again and again.

00:28:24.990 --> 00:28:28.180
It repeats it every time you
see a Western in some sense.

00:28:28.180 --> 00:28:30.320
Every Western is
implicitly a story

00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:32.510
about the foundation
of a society,

00:28:32.510 --> 00:28:36.610
about the equation
of a community.

00:28:36.610 --> 00:28:38.170
It's always implicitly about it.

00:28:38.170 --> 00:28:41.650
In many Westerns, this
is an explicit topic.

00:28:41.650 --> 00:28:44.980
And what we can say
is that this means

00:28:44.980 --> 00:28:48.870
that the Western is the United
States' form of a kind of story

00:28:48.870 --> 00:28:50.640
that every culture has, right?

00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:54.220
The ancient Greeks had
a founding mythology

00:28:54.220 --> 00:28:56.750
grounded in The Iliad
and The Odyssey, right?

00:28:56.750 --> 00:29:01.350
And Tudor England had
a founding mythology

00:29:01.350 --> 00:29:04.560
partly promulgated by
Shakespeare in the history

00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:10.690
plays that were put on
in the public theater

00:29:10.690 --> 00:29:13.120
in the 16th century.

00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:15.740
And what we can say
about these founding

00:29:15.740 --> 00:29:20.020
stories as they are always,
in some sense, fantasies

00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:21.000
or fictions.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.870
But they articulate
values and assumptions

00:29:23.870 --> 00:29:26.690
that the culture,
in some sense, would

00:29:26.690 --> 00:29:28.410
like to believe about itself.

00:29:28.410 --> 00:29:32.100
And by their reiteration,
by their repetition,

00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:34.030
by telling them
again and again, they

00:29:34.030 --> 00:29:38.320
instantiate these values, these
assumptions about the society,

00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:41.280
in the culture as a whole.

00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:43.140
Their very repetition
is important.

00:29:43.140 --> 00:29:44.950
Because one of the
fundamental things

00:29:44.950 --> 00:29:48.680
about a myth or a mythology, one
of the most fundamental things

00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:50.570
about it, is that
it's a collective--

00:29:50.570 --> 00:29:52.940
it's a collective story.

00:29:52.940 --> 00:29:55.050
It's not made by
a single person.

00:29:55.050 --> 00:29:57.310
And one way to think
about all Westerns,

00:29:57.310 --> 00:29:59.650
although of course many
of the best Westerns

00:29:59.650 --> 00:30:01.850
have the trace of--
more than the traces--

00:30:01.850 --> 00:30:04.660
have the imprint of
individual contributions.

00:30:04.660 --> 00:30:07.120
John Ford-- John Ford
is a great director.

00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:10.470
And there are aspects of
John Ford's personality

00:30:10.470 --> 00:30:11.870
in every one of his Westerns.

00:30:11.870 --> 00:30:14.920
Nonetheless, even the most
profoundly Fordian Western

00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:17.400
is still a collaborative
form, not only

00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:21.152
because Ford as a director--
because the movies

00:30:21.152 --> 00:30:22.860
are inherently
collaborative because they

00:30:22.860 --> 00:30:24.970
have so many different
people who contribute

00:30:24.970 --> 00:30:26.380
to the creation of the whole.

00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:28.160
No one, even the most
powerful director,

00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:30.284
can completely
control everything.

00:30:30.284 --> 00:30:32.200
The greatest directors
know how to collaborate

00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:34.541
with their performance
and their writers.

00:30:34.541 --> 00:30:36.290
But in any case, it's
a collaborative form

00:30:36.290 --> 00:30:37.400
to begin with, right?

00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:39.470
But there's another
kind of collaboration,

00:30:39.470 --> 00:30:40.320
several other kinds.

00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:41.100
What are they?

00:30:41.100 --> 00:30:44.310
One of them is that every
Western is implicitly

00:30:44.310 --> 00:30:46.520
in a conversation with
every previous Western.

00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:48.610
And in that since,
there's no author.

00:30:48.610 --> 00:30:51.460
It's a collective-- the story
of the American Western,

00:30:51.460 --> 00:30:53.230
in that sense, is
a collective story.

00:30:53.230 --> 00:30:56.050
It's a creation of the culture.

00:30:56.050 --> 00:30:58.280
And in fact, every new
version of the Western

00:30:58.280 --> 00:31:00.780
adds to the mythology
in some sense, right?

00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:03.730
So in that sense, we can
think of genre reforms

00:31:03.730 --> 00:31:05.660
generally, the
Western in particular,

00:31:05.660 --> 00:31:11.667
as a particular kind of
ongoing, recurring discourse.

00:31:11.667 --> 00:31:14.000
And if you come back again
to the arguments I was making

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:19.930
at the beginning of our
class about the ways in which

00:31:19.930 --> 00:31:22.450
genre forms and
especially the Western

00:31:22.450 --> 00:31:25.370
can be seen to sort of
dramatize cultural change

00:31:25.370 --> 00:31:31.320
or the way in which a society's
attitudes may alter over time

00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:34.040
exactly because so many
elements of a genre

00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:37.030
are stable and recognizable,
those that are different

00:31:37.030 --> 00:31:41.190
are easy to recognize, are
easy to identify and speculate

00:31:41.190 --> 00:31:42.920
about.

00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:45.260
So one of the things
we're recognizing here

00:31:45.260 --> 00:31:48.960
is that in a certain sense, the
very fact that the mythology is

00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:51.650
open, is unfinished,
reflects something that's

00:31:51.650 --> 00:31:54.115
fundamental about society too.

00:31:54.115 --> 00:31:56.240
And this is part of Raymond
Williams' great insight

00:31:56.240 --> 00:31:58.040
into culture when
he said-- what he

00:31:58.040 --> 00:32:01.870
said was culture is a constant
mix of emergent, traditional,

00:32:01.870 --> 00:32:03.260
and dominant voices.

00:32:03.260 --> 00:32:04.770
It's never over.

00:32:04.770 --> 00:32:06.810
What culture is
is a conversation.

00:32:06.810 --> 00:32:11.100
It's never any one fixed thing
because culture is always

00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:11.730
in process.

00:32:11.730 --> 00:32:13.360
It's always changing.

00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:17.930
And what we can say-- the
value of these genre reforms,

00:32:17.930 --> 00:32:21.640
and especially because the
movies could reach so widely,

00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:25.240
even across linguistic barriers,
the value of the movies

00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:29.580
or the power of the movies as a
form of this kind of discourse

00:32:29.580 --> 00:32:32.280
is overwhelmingly clear
exactly because we

00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:34.830
can imagine this process,
this conversation,

00:32:34.830 --> 00:32:38.760
going on repeatedly over time--
the recognizable elements

00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:41.540
juxtaposed against the elements
that are not recognizable,

00:32:41.540 --> 00:32:45.620
allowing for a kind of constant
process of reevaluation,

00:32:45.620 --> 00:32:48.090
of rehearsal, and of
rethinking, right?

00:32:48.090 --> 00:32:49.850
And we can say, in
fact, that that's

00:32:49.850 --> 00:32:53.510
one of the deep functions that
genre forms in general play

00:32:53.510 --> 00:32:55.680
and it's one of the
central functions

00:32:55.680 --> 00:32:57.340
that the Hollywood movie plays.

00:32:57.340 --> 00:32:59.040
And I'll try to
concretize this for you

00:32:59.040 --> 00:33:02.330
this evening in a kind of--
it's a kind of comic attempt,

00:33:02.330 --> 00:33:05.520
but I'm going to give you
a kind of capsule history

00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:09.280
of the trajectory of the
Western from its earliest days,

00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:12.830
from "The Great Train
Robbery," to "Unforgiven."

00:33:12.830 --> 00:33:16.120
So the Western is a mythology.

00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:17.390
It's a mythology.

00:33:17.390 --> 00:33:19.440
The fact that mythologies
themselves are open

00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:23.270
ended, are spaces in which a
society defines and redefines

00:33:23.270 --> 00:33:26.680
its identity and its central
values, makes the Western movie

00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:30.510
a particularly powerful and
central anthropological space.

00:33:30.510 --> 00:33:33.250
It enacts, in different
ways over and over again,

00:33:33.250 --> 00:33:35.660
a story about the
founding of society.

00:33:35.660 --> 00:33:37.810
And at the end, it
is grounded therefore

00:33:37.810 --> 00:33:42.270
also in a series of
complex dichotomies

00:33:42.270 --> 00:33:45.420
that are worth making
clear, even though they're

00:33:45.420 --> 00:33:47.980
very obvious when you think
about what all Westerns do.

00:33:47.980 --> 00:33:48.900
But think about them.

00:33:48.900 --> 00:33:51.130
One of the dichotomies
is the dichotomy

00:33:51.130 --> 00:33:52.880
between what is
thought to be civilized

00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:55.750
and what is thought to be
savage-- between civilization

00:33:55.750 --> 00:33:56.600
and savagery.

00:33:56.600 --> 00:33:58.930
Another is often
between East and West

00:33:58.930 --> 00:34:01.860
in which the east
represents civilization

00:34:01.860 --> 00:34:04.460
and the west the sa-- but
there's an ambivalence.

00:34:04.460 --> 00:34:06.420
Because the east is
also a place that

00:34:06.420 --> 00:34:10.429
is thought to be dessicated
and lacking vitality.

00:34:10.429 --> 00:34:13.110
And the west is thought to
be an authentic place that

00:34:13.110 --> 00:34:18.719
tests us in our heroic,
largest possibilities, right?

00:34:18.719 --> 00:34:21.580
And another kind of
dichotomy that is present

00:34:21.580 --> 00:34:24.900
in virtually all Westerns is a
dichotomy between what we might

00:34:24.900 --> 00:34:27.659
call the claims of community,
the claims of society

00:34:27.659 --> 00:34:30.050
on the one side, and the
claims of the individual

00:34:30.050 --> 00:34:31.280
on the other side, right?

00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:33.460
This is a special
problem for the Western

00:34:33.460 --> 00:34:37.090
because it celebrates American
individualism so powerfully.

00:34:37.090 --> 00:34:39.120
The iconic scenes of
the Western in which

00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:42.620
two men wearing guns square
off against each other

00:34:42.620 --> 00:34:45.850
and the quicker one survives--
that scene of the quick draw

00:34:45.850 --> 00:34:48.620
one and of the death
in the dusty street

00:34:48.620 --> 00:34:51.889
could be sent to be a kind
of embodiment of these values

00:34:51.889 --> 00:34:54.710
in which you have
to rely on yourself.

00:34:54.710 --> 00:34:56.030
You can't rely on someone else.

00:34:56.030 --> 00:34:57.190
You can't rely on
the government.

00:34:57.190 --> 00:34:58.570
You can't rely on the Sheriff.

00:34:58.570 --> 00:35:00.010
You can't rely on the police.

00:35:00.010 --> 00:35:01.630
You can't rely on
your neighbors.

00:35:01.630 --> 00:35:03.110
You have to trust yourself.

00:35:03.110 --> 00:35:04.840
And in fact, one
of the ways you can

00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:07.430
see the power of these
Western mythologies operating,

00:35:07.430 --> 00:35:09.450
as it seems to me
in some sense, one

00:35:09.450 --> 00:35:11.540
of the great divides in
the United States today

00:35:11.540 --> 00:35:13.830
over the question of
guns and gun control

00:35:13.830 --> 00:35:18.110
is partly grounded in these
myths of individualism

00:35:18.110 --> 00:35:20.490
that the Western
mythology has been

00:35:20.490 --> 00:35:24.510
promulgating since before
the advent of the movies.

00:35:24.510 --> 00:35:26.640
In other words, the
attitudes-- and in fact,

00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:32.060
if you listen to even some of
the most extreme forms of gun

00:35:32.060 --> 00:35:35.060
rights advocates actually
talk in a language

00:35:35.060 --> 00:35:38.630
that we can recognize from
Westerns, from Western movies.

00:35:38.630 --> 00:35:40.840
Not an accident that one
of our recent presidents

00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:45.310
was a star in Western films
and actually remembered

00:35:45.310 --> 00:35:48.960
some films he'd been in as if
they'd been actual history.

00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:51.510
And I don't say that in a
way to sort of disparage

00:35:51.510 --> 00:35:54.850
poor Ronald Reagan at all,
but as a way of reminding us

00:35:54.850 --> 00:35:58.480
the confluence or the
confusion of actual history

00:35:58.480 --> 00:36:00.600
with these mythological
accounts of the west

00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:04.047
is a characteristic feature
of the American imagination.

00:36:04.047 --> 00:36:05.130
How could it be otherwise?

00:36:05.130 --> 00:36:09.070
We have been so inundated in
these stories about the west.

00:36:09.070 --> 00:36:11.990
So another dichotomy, then,
is that between society

00:36:11.990 --> 00:36:14.080
and the individual,
maybe finally we

00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:17.820
can say a dichotomy between
culture and nature, right?

00:36:17.820 --> 00:36:20.240
Which is the story that's
enacted again and again

00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:24.290
in the great epic stories that
every culture sort of generates

00:36:24.290 --> 00:36:26.060
for itself.

00:36:26.060 --> 00:36:29.060
One of the most distinctive
features of these dichotomies

00:36:29.060 --> 00:36:31.640
is the divided hero,
a character you'll

00:36:31.640 --> 00:36:34.650
see embodied with great
complexity in tonight's film

00:36:34.650 --> 00:36:36.880
played by John Wayne,
a character who

00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:40.800
is-- the Western hero is
often seen very ambivalently

00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:44.680
as both a savior and a savage,
as someone who has the power

00:36:44.680 --> 00:36:51.620
and authority to bring a kind
of decency and lawfulness

00:36:51.620 --> 00:36:54.890
to a community, but who
is himself so touched by,

00:36:54.890 --> 00:36:57.790
so tainted by the very
savagery that he tried

00:36:57.790 --> 00:37:00.570
to tame, that he's often
excluded from the community

00:37:00.570 --> 00:37:02.070
once it's been created.

00:37:02.070 --> 00:37:04.560
And you'll see a wonderful
instance, a complex instance

00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:07.340
of that, in tonight's film
in the way the John Wayne

00:37:07.340 --> 00:37:09.330
character, at the
very end of the film,

00:37:09.330 --> 00:37:12.050
is in a certain sense
excluded from the community

00:37:12.050 --> 00:37:15.920
that he has helped to defend.

00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:17.630
One way to see many
of these things

00:37:17.630 --> 00:37:19.660
or to clarify many
of these things

00:37:19.660 --> 00:37:23.410
is to juxtapose--
or maybe as a way

00:37:23.410 --> 00:37:28.780
of crystallizing this process
I'm talking about whereby

00:37:28.780 --> 00:37:34.360
a genre form can, in some sense,
dramatize changing values.

00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:37.500
I want to show you one scene.

00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:39.960
Maybe I'll just
end with the scene.

00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:42.080
This is a scene from
"McCabe and Mrs. Miller",

00:37:42.080 --> 00:37:45.490
the film you're going to see
in two weeks, a Western that

00:37:45.490 --> 00:37:48.390
comes after the breakdown
of the Hollywood system,

00:37:48.390 --> 00:37:52.410
after the movies no longer
have the responsibility

00:37:52.410 --> 00:37:56.160
or the obligation-- no
longer saw themselves

00:37:56.160 --> 00:37:59.800
as having to speak to
everyone-- a moment of great,

00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:03.220
in many ways, extraordinary
artistic freedom,

00:38:03.220 --> 00:38:06.880
the period of the late '60s
and through a good part

00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:08.180
of the 1970s.

00:38:08.180 --> 00:38:11.610
Many people would say it was
a moment in American cinema

00:38:11.610 --> 00:38:14.240
unrivaled for its
complexity and its richness.

00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:16.390
And one of the reasons
it was such a rich moment

00:38:16.390 --> 00:38:18.190
was that the movies
had been liberated

00:38:18.190 --> 00:38:20.969
from their responsibility to
talk to the whole culture.

00:38:20.969 --> 00:38:23.010
There was an irony connected
to that because they

00:38:23.010 --> 00:38:25.580
have smaller audience.

00:38:25.580 --> 00:38:28.440
But it gave them a kind
of political freedom,

00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:31.160
a kind of moral freedom
that they hadn't had before.

00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:33.024
And I want to show
you one scene.

00:38:33.024 --> 00:38:34.690
One reason I'm choosing
it is because it

00:38:34.690 --> 00:38:37.471
will resonate for you when
we come to "McCabe and Mrs.

00:38:37.471 --> 00:38:37.970
Miller."

00:38:37.970 --> 00:38:39.830
But it requires that
you know one thing.

00:38:39.830 --> 00:38:42.840
The scene, the iconic scene
that I mentioned earlier

00:38:42.840 --> 00:38:46.470
where two heroes or
one hero and a bad guy

00:38:46.470 --> 00:38:49.870
square off against each other
on a dusty street to draw a gun

00:38:49.870 --> 00:38:53.830
might be said to be the
most recurring or the most--

00:38:53.830 --> 00:38:55.429
the quintessential
Western scene,

00:38:55.429 --> 00:38:57.220
although there are
others we might nominate

00:38:57.220 --> 00:38:58.990
as almost as important.

00:38:58.990 --> 00:39:01.460
And in order to understand
the scene you're about to see,

00:39:01.460 --> 00:39:03.290
you need to recognize
that what lies

00:39:03.290 --> 00:39:06.990
behind this very subversive
version of the shoot out

00:39:06.990 --> 00:39:09.510
are dozens, if not
hundreds, of earlier

00:39:09.510 --> 00:39:12.530
scenes in which heroic
characters that we greatly

00:39:12.530 --> 00:39:16.150
admire shoot down bad
guys in the street, right?

00:39:16.150 --> 00:39:18.280
Well, here's a scene
from "McCabe and Mrs.

00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:19.960
Miller" of this iconic moment.

00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:21.540
Remember, "McCabe
and Mrs. Miller"

00:39:21.540 --> 00:39:25.750
comes after the
consensus dispensation.

00:39:25.750 --> 00:39:27.830
It's free not to be
a consensus form.

00:39:27.830 --> 00:39:29.370
But one reason I
want to show you

00:39:29.370 --> 00:39:31.400
this is I hope you can
recognize that what

00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:34.250
gives this scene its
power is not-- it's

00:39:34.250 --> 00:39:36.870
very brilliantly
photographed and dramatized.

00:39:36.870 --> 00:39:40.590
But what gives it its
power has very little

00:39:40.590 --> 00:39:43.220
to do with what it itself does.

00:39:43.220 --> 00:39:45.770
What grants its
enormous authority

00:39:45.770 --> 00:39:49.670
are the dozens, if not hundreds,
of prior scenes with which it's

00:39:49.670 --> 00:39:52.870
in conversation, against which
it is contrasting itself.

00:39:52.870 --> 00:39:54.720
Because this scene
of confrontation

00:39:54.720 --> 00:39:57.820
between two individuals--
who has the faster gun,

00:39:57.820 --> 00:40:01.230
right-- is, as I've
suggested, the iconic moment

00:40:01.230 --> 00:40:02.450
in the Western.

00:40:02.450 --> 00:40:04.940
And it is, in the
heroic Western,

00:40:04.940 --> 00:40:09.500
in the traditional Western,
it's a heroic moment

00:40:09.500 --> 00:40:13.390
of individual self assertion
in which good conquers evil.

00:40:13.390 --> 00:40:15.260
Watch Robert Altman's
version of this.

00:40:15.260 --> 00:40:17.236
WOMAN: Careful.

00:40:17.236 --> 00:40:19.212

The trick is not to hit
it, but to make it float.

00:40:51.199 --> 00:40:53.107
You're supposed to
realize he's lying here.

00:40:53.107 --> 00:40:55.970

00:41:24.498 --> 00:41:25.950
-I want to buy some socks.

around half-naked

-[INAUDIBLE] I just wear it.

00:42:04.092 --> 00:42:05.747
Can't hit nothing with it.

-Well, that don't make no sense.

[END PLAYBACK]

00:43:09.027 --> 00:43:10.860
BOY: So what the scene--
what the scene does

00:43:10.860 --> 00:43:13.580
is it turns on its
head what we might say

00:43:13.580 --> 00:43:15.850
are the central
values or assumptions

00:43:15.850 --> 00:43:19.040
that have lain
behind such a seen

00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:21.590
in dozens, if not hundreds,
of prior Westerns.

00:43:21.590 --> 00:43:24.970
And that's a distilled
example of this process

00:43:24.970 --> 00:43:27.600
of a conversation that
goes on-- if it goes on

00:43:27.600 --> 00:43:30.470
for a long enough time, the
content of the conversation

00:43:30.470 --> 00:43:33.850
can virtually reverse itself
even though the genre remains

00:43:33.850 --> 00:43:34.660
stable.

00:43:34.660 --> 00:43:36.360
And that's one of
the-- we might call

00:43:36.360 --> 00:43:40.510
that the genius of genre,
the genius of a genre form.

00:43:40.510 --> 00:43:42.530
It has to do with--
it's a version of what

00:43:42.530 --> 00:43:45.310
I mean when I talk
about the cultural work

00:43:45.310 --> 00:43:49.450
or the anthropological
function that movies have.

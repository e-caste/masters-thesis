DAVID JORDAN: Hello, and
welcome back to recitation.

00:00:08.915 --> 00:00:12.660
The problem I'd like to work
with you right now is we

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.230
have a line which goes
through two points that

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.990
are given to us
explicitly, and we

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.830
have a plane which is
given to us by an equation.

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:26.260
And what we want to know
is where does this line

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:27.900
intersect this plane?

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.230
And so one thing I would
suggest to get started

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.230
is we need to give a
parametrization of our line

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:34.530
to get started.

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.400
OK, so why don't you work
on that, pause the tape,

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.290
and we'll come back in a moment
and work it out together.

00:00:47.862 --> 00:00:48.570
OK, welcome back.

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.750
Let's get started.

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.690
So let's start off by
drawing a cartoon of what's

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:55.370
going on here.

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:02.240
So we have this plane
sitting in space.

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:06.100
And we have some line kind
of going through space.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.100
So maybe it's like this.

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.350
And there's this single
point of intersection.

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.730
So even from the cartoon,
we can kind of, sort of

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:16.890
see two things
which are going on.

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.020
Which is that we would expect
a point of intersection,

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.620
or we would expect
exactly one, if we

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:27.205
choose kind of a generic
line and generic plane.

00:01:27.205 --> 00:01:29.330
In order for there to be
no points of intersection,

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:30.746
we would have to
have a line which

00:01:30.746 --> 00:01:35.110
was parallel to the plane,
which is very unlikely.

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:36.980
And then otherwise,
we expect exactly

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:39.760
just one point of intersection.

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:47.050
So I want to break this
sort of into two components.

00:01:47.050 --> 00:02:01.030
So we have an equation
for the plane.

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.280
And when I see an equation
describing a plane,

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.830
I think of that as a sort
of test for membership.

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.240
We can plug in a point
(x, y, z) to the equation,

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.660
and we can ask, does this
point make the equation

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.250
true, or doesn't it?

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.900
And if it does, then that point
(x, y, z) is in the plane,

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.140
and otherwise it's
not in the plane.

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.520
For the line, what we're going
to need to do in a second is

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.770
we're going to need to come
up with a parametrization.

00:02:32.462 --> 00:02:34.170
And a parametrization
is a different kind

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.600
of thing than an equation
describing a line.

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.960
A parametrization, rather than
being a test for membership,

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:44.620
is really a way of listing
all the points on the line.

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.740
So when we give a
parametrization-- in a second--

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.198
then we're going
to be able to list

00:02:48.198 --> 00:02:49.430
all the points in the line.

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.055
And then we're going
to be able to plug

00:02:51.055 --> 00:02:53.510
our list into the
equation for the plane,

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.580
and find out which point on our
list is actually in the plane.

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:00.480
Which one satisfies the
membership equation.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.030
So why don't we
get started first

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.900
with parametrizing the line.

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.590
So the general kind
of picture here

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.750
is we have a point P_1 in space,
and we have another point P_2

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.010
in space, and we want to
parametrize the line which

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:19.597
goes between them.

00:03:19.597 --> 00:03:21.680
And there's actually a
very simple way to do this.

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:30.380
What we do is we want to
take our original point P_1,

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:38.317
and we want to add a variable t
times the vector P_2 minus P_1

00:03:38.317 --> 00:03:39.150
which connects them.

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.560
So that's this one here.

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:44.940
OK.

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:49.220
So this is a reasonable thing
to do, because if we plug in t

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:52.510
equals 0, then we just get P_1.

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:54.780
And if we plug in
t equals 1, then

00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:00.190
we get P_1 plus P_2 minus
P_1; we just get P_2.

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:03.990
So this line definitely goes
through those two points,

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:07.020
and that's all that
we really need.

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:10.380
So in our specific
problem here, we

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:18.470
have-- P_1 we can take to be
the first point, 0, minus 1, 1.

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:28.750
And then we have t times--
so we have 2 minus 0 is 2-- 3

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:37.170
minus a negative 1 is
4-- and 3 minus 1 is 2.

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:39.590
And this is the vector
connecting those.

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.660
And so we can write, we
can just combine these two

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:54.730
and we get 2t, 4t
minus 1, and 2t plus 1.

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:58.380
OK?

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:06.210
So this here is a
parametrization of the line.

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:09.710
So as we vary t-- now, walking
back over to our picture--

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:13.260
as we vary t,
we're going to just

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.490
be listing all the
points on the line.

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:18.510
And we're going to
ask, for which point

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:20.490
are we actually
contained in the plane?

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:25.230
So let's go over to the board
over here and solve that.

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:28.570
So what we want to know is does
this point satisfy the equation

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:29.290
for the plane?

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:39.450
And our plane was given to us by
the equation 2x plus y minus z

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:41.870
equals 1.

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:45.940
So x on our line is 2t.

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:56.160
So we have 2 times 2t,
plus-- y is 4t minus 1,

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:00.700
minus-- z is 2t plus 1.

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:04.781
And all this is
meant to equal 1.

00:06:04.781 --> 00:06:05.280
OK.

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:17.630
So if we expand this out, we
get 4t plus another 4t minus 2t

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:23.000
and we get minus 1 minus
another 1-- so we get minus 2--

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.490
equals 1.

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:34.180
So altogether we
get 6t equals 3,

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:35.600
so that tells us that t is 1/2.

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:41.910
OK?

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:44.690
And finally, to
get our answer, we

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:47.960
need to go back over to our
parametrization of the line

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:51.170
and plug in t equals 1/2.

00:06:51.170 --> 00:07:00.500
So coming back over here,
plugging in t equals 1/2,

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:12.750
we get 1-- 2 minus 1 is
1-- and 1 plus 1 is 2.

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:21.090
OK, so we get the point of
intersection, (1, 1, 2).

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:25.200
So that was quite a few steps,
so let's review what we did.

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:27.820
So to begin with, we
needed to understand

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:31.170
that the equation for a plane
is a test for membership.

00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:33.140
It's not a list of all
the points in the plane,

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:34.750
it's a test for membership.

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:38.130
The parametrization of the
line, on the other hand,

00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:41.320
is a way of listing all
of the points on the line.

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:43.790
And so if our goal
is to find which

00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:47.230
particular point on the line
is contained in the plane,

00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:50.120
then we need to
parametrize our line,

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:52.440
and then we need to plug
in our parametrization

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:54.240
to our equation for
the plane, and then

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:57.700
solve for the value of
t which makes it true.

00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:00.550
Finding that t then we've--
that's is equivalent to finding

00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:02.061
a point on our line.

00:08:02.061 --> 00:08:04.184
And I think I'll
leave it at that.

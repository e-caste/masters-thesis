WEBVTT

00:00:13.945 --> 00:00:15.320
GERBRAND CEDER:
So we'll do a lab

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.490
that essentially covers
modeling things with potentials.

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:22.700
You do such things like
calculate a vacancy formation

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.620
energy, a surface energy.

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:30.080
So the idea will be that
working with a simple energy

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.090
model, first of all,
you learn the mechanics

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.040
of these kind of
calculations, building

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.850
supercells with a defect,
studying convergence of them.

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.380
So that's one thing.

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:43.910
You'll find that the hard
part is often figuring out

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.910
exactly what calculation
to do and how

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:51.290
to put the numbers together
to get a physical quantity.

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:53.450
And then you'll
also learn something

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:56.030
about the things we talked
about here, what kind

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:57.925
of results potentials give.

00:00:57.925 --> 00:00:59.300
For example, you
[INAUDIBLE] tell

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.050
you will find that the vacancy
formation energy is very

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.900
close to the cohesive energy,
something we discussed,

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.840
we talked about.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.820
So those are the
things for Thursday.

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.233
And I think you'll have
about two weeks to finish

00:01:14.233 --> 00:01:16.400
the assignment, although
the first one is really not

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:17.120
that intensive.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:21.163
You'll probably be able to
do it considerably faster.

00:01:21.163 --> 00:01:22.580
So what I want to
do today is just

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:27.290
finish up empirical
energy models

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.870
by focusing on organic
materials and oxides.

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:31.940
And I'll only do about
half of the lecture,

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.580
and then Professor Marzari
will give an introduction

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.610
to the next part, which
is the ab initio method.

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.610
So he'll start with some
work, some introduction

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.280
to quantum mechanics, and then
lead that for the next two

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.240
lectures into an initio methods
for energy calculations.

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.740
OK.

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.930
If you sort of
remember this diagram,

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.780
so what we did last time, we
talked about pair potentials,

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.940
discussed sort of the
formal way why they fail

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.840
when things are very covalent.

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.790
And then I spent most
of the lecture talking

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:12.200
about pair functionals,
things like the embedded atom

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.000
method, the blue model.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.130
And we talked a little bit
about cluster potentials.

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.690
OK.

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.300
So I showed you the example
of a three-body potential

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.480
for silicon.

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.120
Today, I want to talk
about organic systems

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.280
and Oxides Let me start
with organic systems,

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.050
where in organic systems
potential modeling,

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:37.620
or call it empirical function
modeling, works extremely well.

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.380
And there's a very
good reason for that.

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.530
And I'll come to that.

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.180
You tend to distinguish
between what

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.060
are called bonded and
non-bonded interactions.

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.410
So the bonded ones are the
one along covalent bonds.

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.340
So let's say you had
two methane molecules

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:02.030
interacting, so CH4 and CH4.

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.120
So the bonded interactions
would, for example,

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.290
be the ones here.

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:12.680
That's the only ones.

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.390
Say, the carbon-hydrogen bond
would be a bonded interaction.

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.100
The non-bonded interaction
are than the other ones,

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.650
the ones that are not
between covalent bonds.

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.760
So for example, this
hydrogen-hydrogen

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.860
would interact through
a non-bonded term.

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.925
And this becomes important
when you make interactions,

00:03:34.925 --> 00:03:37.910
say, between long chain
molecules or polymers.

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:42.710
If you did sort of one
polymer and another one,

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:45.540
you would have bonded
interactions along the chain.

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.420
And you would have
non-bonded interactions

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.660
between different chain parts,
between different chains,

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:53.060
or between one part of
the chain and another

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.630
if it sort of were
to fold on itself.

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:59.300
So keep that in mind, bonded
and non-bonded interactions.

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:04.490
So I wanted to do a
short exercise in class

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:08.000
making you think through
the relevant potential terms

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.680
you would need if you
wanted to, say, study water.

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:17.360
So here's water, H2O, one
oxygen, two hydrogens.

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:21.200
So I also want to make
you think through,

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:22.880
so that you realize
that it's really not

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:27.440
that hard to make a sort of
reasonable potential model

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:28.490
for an organic.

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:29.910
So let me make a wide slide.

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:32.980
So I got to erase that.

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:38.250
How do we erase here?

00:04:40.948 --> 00:04:43.130
There we go.

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:47.360
It's the very tedious
way of erasing.

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.860
OK.

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:53.400
So who wants to start?

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.300
What should go in?

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:57.190
So we have water.

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:03.410
Think about it.

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:06.290
Let's say I was doing
water in the liquid state.

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:07.940
So I have a bunch
of water molecules.

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:09.850
So what kind of
interactions would I need?

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:13.380
Yes.

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:14.672
AUDIENCE: They all have dipole.

00:05:14.672 --> 00:05:16.588
GERBRAND CEDER: Exactly,
they all have dipole.

00:05:16.588 --> 00:05:17.890
It's a good one to start with.

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:21.930
So there's a small
amount of positive charge

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:23.580
on the hydrogens.

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:25.857
And there's some amount
of negative charge,

00:05:25.857 --> 00:05:28.440
which is 2 times the amount of
positive charge on the protons.

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:29.315
So you have a dipole.

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:34.970
So you have a dipole on the two.

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:38.740
How would you model
that interaction?

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:39.650
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:40.733
GERBRAND CEDER: I'm sorry?

00:05:40.733 --> 00:05:42.107
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:42.107 --> 00:05:43.190
GERBRAND CEDER: I'm sorry.

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:43.732
I can't hear.

00:05:43.732 --> 00:05:45.915
AUDIENCE: Lennard-Jones.

00:05:45.915 --> 00:05:48.040
GERBRAND CEDER: I wouldn't
do a Lennard-Jones model

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:50.290
for the dipole
because the dipole is

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:52.603
essentially electrostatic.

00:05:52.603 --> 00:05:54.520
So there's sort of two
ways you could do this.

00:05:54.520 --> 00:06:00.100
You could set up directly a
dipole-dipole interaction,

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:05.460
where you centered the dipole
somewhere on the center of mass

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:06.970
of the molecule.

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:10.800
Or you could treat the charged
components of the dipole

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:13.050
explicitly.

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:17.430
So you could say, you know, I
have a delta plus here, delta

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:17.940
plus here.

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:19.530
I have a delta minus here.

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:22.586
And that would interact
electrostatically.

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:30.720
And you could set up a direct
electrostatic interaction.

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:35.340
The dipole-dipole one is
probably easier to implement,

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:37.080
is also somewhat shorter range.

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:39.540
But both would work.

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:43.920
If you treat the
molecule as rigid,

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:47.185
then the dipole approximation
and the electrostatic one,

00:06:47.185 --> 00:06:48.810
where you take the
charge individually,

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:51.030
is essentially the same.

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:54.030
But if the molecule,
of course, can flap,

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:58.410
then the dipole moment is
changing on that molecule.

00:06:58.410 --> 00:06:59.770
So that's definitely one term.

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:03.154
So what else would you use?

00:07:03.154 --> 00:07:03.654
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:07:03.654 --> 00:07:06.050
AUDIENCE: OH bonding?

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:08.120
GERBRAND CEDER: OH bonding, OK.

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:13.070
You guys take all the hard
ones, all the hard ones first.

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:15.870
Yeah, so hydrogen bonding--

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:22.550
so if there's an oxygen here and
there's a water sort of here,

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:23.770
you have hydrogen bonding.

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:30.960
What will you use for that?

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:31.890
What kind of form?

00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:40.830
Any form is as good
as any other one.

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:42.990
People sometimes just use
Lennard-Jones potentials

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:46.215
for that, but you can
use something else.

00:07:46.215 --> 00:07:47.340
So what else would you use?

00:07:54.513 --> 00:07:55.680
What else should go in here?

00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:05.330
Well, if you don't assume your
hydrogen molecule is rigid,

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:08.990
then you definitely need
stuff for the bonds there.

00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:18.330
So you may need an OH bond
potential, which obviously

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:25.600
would have a bond stretching
part and then probably

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:30.630
a bending part, so OH bending.

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:37.875
What would you make these?

00:08:37.875 --> 00:08:39.690
What kind of forms
would you use?

00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:50.570
Too early in the
morning for this?

00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:53.510
I mean, you know,
I would always say,

00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:56.600
before you get into complicated
models, take the simplest form

00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:57.650
and see where you get.

00:08:57.650 --> 00:08:59.330
For bending, you
could literally take

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:01.730
a quadratic in the bond angle.

00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:07.610
That allows you to do reasonable
stretch around the equilibrium

00:09:07.610 --> 00:09:08.420
geometry.

00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:11.750
And a water molecule
does not flop over.

00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:15.860
It's hydrogens don't really
flop over that easily.

00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:19.540
Stretch, you could also, again,
use just a spring constant,

00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:23.160
so r minus r0 squared.

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:27.300
And then if you feel you go too
far away out of the equilibrium

00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:29.910
bond length, you could have
more complicated potentials.

00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:35.790
But an OH bond is quite
stiff, so it's not

00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:40.047
going to vibrate with
an enormous amplitude.

00:09:40.047 --> 00:09:41.130
So what else will we need?

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:51.050
I think we're sort of
missing one essential term.

00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:53.510
We have very few
non-bonded terms

00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:58.060
We only have the attractive
part of the non-bonded terms,

00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:01.070
the dipole-dipole and
the electrostatic.

00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:04.070
But there has to be
some amount of repulsion

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:07.340
between the hydrogens.

00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:11.900
These cannot come infinitely
close together and the same

00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:14.900
for the oxygen. So you need
some non-bonded van der Waals

00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:15.710
interactions.

00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:32.900
OK.

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:36.830
And those you could easily
give a Lennard-Jones for.

00:10:36.830 --> 00:10:38.480
It seems like,
when you have that,

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:43.160
you have a somewhat reasonable
approximation for water.

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:43.850
OK.

00:10:43.850 --> 00:10:47.055
If you do all this and
you parameterize it well,

00:10:47.055 --> 00:10:47.930
what are you missing?

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:56.450
Yeah-- which is kind
of a vague terminology.

00:10:56.450 --> 00:10:59.840
But you know, I think in
particular what you're missing

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:04.080
is charge transfer,
which can occur in water.

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:09.080
You can also temporarily
form H3O+, which is, I think,

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:11.180
what's called a hydronium
or something like that.

00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:12.020
Hydronium?

00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:14.180
Yeah, hydronium ion.

00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:18.110
So the sort of more
subtle electronic transfer

00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:19.430
effects you would be missing.

00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:21.150
And you'd have to do
quantum mechanics for that.

00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:22.310
And even quantum
mechanics, that wouldn't

00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:24.080
be all that easy to get right.

00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:28.440
OK.

00:11:40.650 --> 00:11:43.770
You know, I plotted here
the bending term for water,

00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:48.660
so you get some idea of how
reasonable quadratics are.

00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:54.230
Here's the exact form,
exact essentially

00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:58.010
as probably as determined
from quantum mechanics.

00:11:58.010 --> 00:12:01.340
If you fit a harmonic through,
so this is your quadratic.

00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:07.250
This is k times theta
minus theta 0 squared.

00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:14.050
If you see, you're pretty
well within the range

00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:18.350
of the exact potential
for at least 10,

00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:21.850
15 degrees on each end of
the equilibrium bond angle.

00:12:21.850 --> 00:12:23.980
And even then you're
not too far off.

00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:27.040
This is in
kilocalories per mole.

00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:29.680
I would say even at
this level you're

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:34.990
kind of less than a
kilocalorie per mole off.

00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:38.060
Notice that a quadratic,
by its nature,

00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:42.520
it's always your potential
is too weak on one side

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:44.560
and it's too stiff
on the other side.

00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:48.340
Because if the real
potential is asymmetric,

00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:50.800
you'll be too stiff on one
side and too weak on the other.

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:53.000
But with a third
order polynomial,

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.140
which is the green line here,
you're already doing very good.

00:12:56.140 --> 00:13:00.580
So you often don't need, per
se, really complicated functions

00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:01.840
of these bond angles.

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:03.340
Because usually the
more complicated

00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:06.780
your function, the more can
go wrong when you fit as well.

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:24.050
OK.

00:13:24.050 --> 00:13:28.910
One other contribution that
you often use in long molecules

00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:32.880
is portion potentials.

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:34.760
And this is actually
not a three-body effect.

00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:38.420
It's actually a
four-body effect.

00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:42.170
If you think of
it ethane, if you

00:13:42.170 --> 00:13:44.300
have carbons here
and hydrogens here--

00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:46.430
it's a little hard to see.

00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:48.570
But if you look at
it from the side,

00:13:48.570 --> 00:13:52.210
so there'd be three
hydrogens on this end.

00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:57.020
The hydrogens can line up.

00:13:57.020 --> 00:13:59.110
So if you look at it
from this direction,

00:13:59.110 --> 00:14:01.280
the carbons are on
top of each other.

00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:07.820
So the hydrogen on one
side are 120 degrees apart.

00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:11.300
Now, the hydrogens
from the higher carbon

00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:15.222
can either be in the
same configuration--

00:14:17.780 --> 00:14:20.164
that's called the
eclipsed configuration--

00:14:25.270 --> 00:14:26.410
or they could be here.

00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:32.760
And that's called a
staggered configuration.

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:39.940
And the staggered one is
somewhat lower in energy.

00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:42.570
So to get that energy
difference right,

00:14:42.570 --> 00:14:44.280
you need, essentially,
a potential

00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:47.320
that describes the torsion
around the carbon-carbon bond.

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:48.960
If you think of
the three hydrogens

00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:52.410
here in sort of fixed position
with respect to each other

00:14:52.410 --> 00:14:54.750
at all under 120
degrees and the ones

00:14:54.750 --> 00:14:57.810
here, to describe
that the energy

00:14:57.810 --> 00:15:00.300
difference between the
different rotational states

00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:01.980
you need a torsion potential.

00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:07.050
And a torsion potential,
you need at least four atoms

00:15:07.050 --> 00:15:10.770
to describe it, four sets of
coordinates to describe it.

00:15:10.770 --> 00:15:16.560
Because the two carbons,
say, define the bond along,

00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:18.240
which are doing the torsion.

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:23.070
And then these vectors, say, one
of the hydrogens on each side

00:15:23.070 --> 00:15:26.380
describe the state
of torsion you're in.

00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:26.970
OK.

00:15:26.970 --> 00:15:32.820
So a torsion potential is, by
definition, a four-body effect.

00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:34.590
These potentials
are often written

00:15:34.590 --> 00:15:38.080
as cosines of some angle.

00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:40.530
And the reason is that
a torsion potential

00:15:40.530 --> 00:15:42.750
needs rotational symmetry.

00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:44.280
If you think of the
ethane molecule,

00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:46.620
for example, every
120 degrees you're

00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:49.350
in the same configuration
because the phase you're

00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:52.150
rotating has 120
degrees symmetry.

00:15:52.150 --> 00:15:53.190
Does everybody see that?

00:15:53.190 --> 00:15:58.630
So you need periodicity
in the angle.

00:15:58.630 --> 00:16:01.560
So that's why a cosine
is very convenient.

00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:08.200
And here's the ethane
rotation energy plot.

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:12.670
So what you see is that
it's minimal at 60 degrees.

00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:14.560
This is the staggered
configuration.

00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:24.810
And this is 120 and 0 and 240.

00:16:24.810 --> 00:16:26.730
These are the eclipse
configurations.

00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:31.620
And so these are easy
potentials to make

00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:34.800
because all you have to look
at is what the symmetry is

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:37.830
of your torsional states.

00:16:37.830 --> 00:16:42.120
So if, for some reason, we're
90 degrees, which is unusual,

00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:44.790
you'd have a cosine of 4 omega.

00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:47.700
If it's 180 degrees, you'd
have a cosine of 2 omega.

00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:55.800
The last one is maybe
slightly less important,

00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:58.440
but there's something called
out-of-plane or improper

00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:01.530
torsion, which is essentially
also a torsion angle.

00:17:01.530 --> 00:17:04.890
But it's not as obvious.

00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:09.720
In the previous one, in
ethane, the four atoms

00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:11.730
along which I
described the torsion

00:17:11.730 --> 00:17:17.190
were sort of in sequence along a
line, along the molecular axis.

00:17:17.190 --> 00:17:19.800
In improper torsion,
they're not.

00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:22.470
Improper torsion
describes, essentially,

00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:26.130
let's say you have a plane
defined by these three

00:17:26.130 --> 00:17:30.450
atoms, a, b, and c.

00:17:30.450 --> 00:17:34.140
How much A comes
out of that plane,

00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:36.780
that's essentially what
improper torsion describes.

00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:39.270
For example, that may be
important for something

00:17:39.270 --> 00:17:42.510
like ammonia.

00:17:42.510 --> 00:17:51.750
Let's say you have N, H, H,
H. So the ammonia molecule can

00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:52.620
flop.

00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:56.580
Sort of you can have the
nitrogen and three hydrogens

00:17:56.580 --> 00:18:00.840
sort of sticking out in a
tetrahedral configuration.

00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:03.330
And the nitrogen can sort
of go through and come out

00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:04.440
on the other end.

00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:06.570
And so it's in the
opposite state.

00:18:06.570 --> 00:18:08.550
And so it's going through
an improper torsion

00:18:08.550 --> 00:18:10.470
when it does that.

00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:12.480
So improper torsion can
be important in things

00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:15.420
that are, say, sp2
hybridized because then they

00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:16.360
want to be flat.

00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:19.050
And if one atom comes
out of the plane,

00:18:19.050 --> 00:18:20.520
you have an improper torsion.

00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:23.520
Or an sp3
hybridization-- where it

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:26.010
wants to be tetrahedral
from a central atom.

00:18:26.010 --> 00:18:29.070
You have three bonds going
towards the tetrahedron.

00:18:29.070 --> 00:18:31.320
And as you push that in
and you squeeze that flat,

00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:33.570
you do an improper
torsion on it.

00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:35.900
And there's many ways you
can measure improper torsion.

00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:38.250
But it's essentially
defined by the angle

00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:41.260
between the plane,
defined by these three

00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:44.380
atoms and this and
the distance that

00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:45.770
describes the improper torsion.

00:18:51.210 --> 00:18:54.750
So I thought I'd show
you a real example.

00:18:54.750 --> 00:18:57.630
I stole this from somebody's
PhD thesis at MIT,

00:18:57.630 --> 00:18:58.500
and I forgot who.

00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:01.590
So I can't give you the
reference, unfortunately,

00:19:01.590 --> 00:19:04.350
but it was somebody
in our department.

00:19:04.350 --> 00:19:06.090
OK.

00:19:06.090 --> 00:19:09.330
Here's a potential model
that the person put together

00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:12.300
for poly-hydroxybenzoic
acid, which I think

00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:14.490
is a component of
a liquid crystal,

00:19:14.490 --> 00:19:17.030
but I don't really remember.

00:19:17.030 --> 00:19:22.470
And so essentially,
there are bonded terms,

00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:26.310
which are really these here.

00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:35.670
what they call valence
is the bond stretch--

00:19:35.670 --> 00:19:38.320
sorry, the bond bending term.

00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:42.570
So it has a form, angle minus
reference angle squared.

00:19:42.570 --> 00:19:46.170
So it's harmonic in
the bond bending.

00:19:46.170 --> 00:19:50.130
There's a torsion
potential along the chain.

00:19:50.130 --> 00:19:53.260
And there's an improper
torsion potential.

00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:58.150
And then the rest is there
are non-bonded terms.

00:19:58.150 --> 00:19:59.680
These are the ones
between, say, you

00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:03.600
know, this piece of the
chain kind of interacting

00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:06.870
with that piece as they
approach each other.

00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:09.330
And that's a van der Waals
term, which is simply model

00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:13.470
as a Lennard-Jones here
and a Coulombic term

00:20:13.470 --> 00:20:16.407
because there are charged
species on this chain.

00:20:16.407 --> 00:20:18.990
So everything that goes in the
model this sort of stuff you've

00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:19.490
seen.

00:20:19.490 --> 00:20:22.099
And it's all fairly
straightforward.

00:20:26.790 --> 00:20:33.390
Potentials work remarkably
well in organic systems.

00:20:33.390 --> 00:20:35.010
And that seems to
be at odds with what

00:20:35.010 --> 00:20:38.730
I said in the beginning, that
pair potentials in particular

00:20:38.730 --> 00:20:42.850
are bad for covalent materials.

00:20:42.850 --> 00:20:44.500
But you have to
remember why they

00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:46.510
are bad because it's
the same reason why

00:20:46.510 --> 00:20:48.100
they're so good in organics.

00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:53.470
The reason pair potentials are
bad in metals is because you

00:20:53.470 --> 00:20:58.360
cannot capture the energy
dependence on coordination.

00:20:58.360 --> 00:20:59.320
OK.

00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:01.630
Remember, if your
coordination stays the same,

00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:03.880
if essentially your
average density around you

00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:06.370
stays the same, you're
actually doing very well

00:21:06.370 --> 00:21:08.470
with pair potentials in metals.

00:21:08.470 --> 00:21:11.980
If you remember when I showed
you that in the embedded atom

00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:14.950
method you can transfer
pieces of the energy

00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:17.900
between the potential and
the embedding function,

00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:19.330
if you go back to
that, you'll see

00:21:19.330 --> 00:21:22.670
that, if the embedding
density is constant,

00:21:22.670 --> 00:21:26.032
then all you have in the
energy is a pair energy.

00:21:26.032 --> 00:21:27.490
So when you're at
constant density,

00:21:27.490 --> 00:21:29.150
pair potentials work fine.

00:21:29.150 --> 00:21:32.410
So why do potentials
work so well in organics?

00:21:32.410 --> 00:21:34.600
Well, the reason
is that they simply

00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:40.270
take different potentials
for different coordinations.

00:21:40.270 --> 00:21:42.760
Different coordinations in
sort of organic chemistry

00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:45.430
are different hybridizations.

00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:52.060
And so rather than, say,
have a generic carbon-carbon

00:21:52.060 --> 00:21:56.650
potential, they have a different
one for sp carbon, sp2 carbon,

00:21:56.650 --> 00:21:57.642
sp3 carbon.

00:21:57.642 --> 00:21:59.350
So essentially, they're
saying, you know,

00:21:59.350 --> 00:22:02.020
we're going to take every
coordination as different.

00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:04.420
And since there's
only a finite set,

00:22:04.420 --> 00:22:07.000
there's essentially
only a very finite set

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:11.800
of chemical environments that
your atoms see in organics.

00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:13.630
You can simply just
parameterize them all,

00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:16.480
and you have a different
potential for all of them.

00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:19.990
So if your carbon is,
say, in polyethylene,

00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:25.050
so it's sp3 hybridized, you'll
take a very different potential

00:22:25.050 --> 00:22:28.890
than if you had an
sp2 hybridized carbon.

00:22:28.890 --> 00:22:32.550
Because in one case, you want
to impose 120 degree angles,

00:22:32.550 --> 00:22:34.950
in other case you want to
impose 109 degree angles.

00:22:34.950 --> 00:22:39.810
So you never, ever deal with
the change of coordination

00:22:39.810 --> 00:22:43.780
of the bonded system.

00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:46.120
In the non-bonded system,
you have to deal with it,

00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:48.538
but there you don't have
covalent bonds anyway.

00:22:48.538 --> 00:22:49.830
So that's why it works so well.

00:22:55.730 --> 00:23:00.040
So you can describe
very well things

00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:04.630
like bending of chains, polymer
chains, with potentials.

00:23:04.630 --> 00:23:07.330
And the reason is it's
essentially a local effect.

00:23:07.330 --> 00:23:09.490
You're always bending
the same bond.

00:23:09.490 --> 00:23:14.430
And whether that's
in polyethylene

00:23:14.430 --> 00:23:16.780
or whether that's an
sp3 carbon in something

00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:18.672
much more complicated,
it's essentially

00:23:18.672 --> 00:23:19.880
the same bond you're bending.

00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:21.940
So you can parameterize
it very well,

00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:25.300
and it's pretty much always
the same, independent of what's

00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:27.700
far away from you.

00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:30.100
But this also means
that there's stuff

00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:31.540
that it will not work for.

00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:37.450
You cannot do chemistry,
reaction chemistry,

00:23:37.450 --> 00:23:39.190
with potentials.

00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:42.550
Because the reason is,
in reaction chemistry,

00:23:42.550 --> 00:23:44.900
you will change
your coordination.

00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:47.980
So you could not study the
polymerization reaction

00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:50.650
of ethylene to polyethylene--

00:23:50.650 --> 00:23:53.950
of ethene to polyethylene.

00:23:53.950 --> 00:23:56.830
Because there you are
actually changing.

00:23:56.830 --> 00:24:00.970
Your carbon is changing
from sp2 to sp3.

00:24:00.970 --> 00:24:02.500
And that would
literally-- you would

00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:05.410
have to sort of, in your
simulation, midstream

00:24:05.410 --> 00:24:08.560
change potential.

00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:11.350
Because your potential is tied
to a particular hybridization.

00:24:11.350 --> 00:24:16.570
You can't really do
bond breaking reactions.

00:24:16.570 --> 00:24:18.640
And the other thing,
which is not fundamental--

00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:22.765
that a lot of these
potentials lack polarization.

00:24:22.765 --> 00:24:28.660
In the end, why does on
sp3 carbon and another one

00:24:28.660 --> 00:24:30.520
don't always behave the same?

00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:32.170
It's because there
can be charges

00:24:32.170 --> 00:24:35.330
that polarize their
electron density,

00:24:35.330 --> 00:24:38.095
but these are fairly
minor effects.

00:24:38.095 --> 00:24:39.470
But that's something
you will not

00:24:39.470 --> 00:24:42.200
get in these kind of schemes.

00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:50.840
You know, because there's
only a sort of finite set

00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:54.140
of chemistries in organic
chemistry or bonding

00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:58.280
environments, making
potentials for organic system

00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:01.280
is a cottage industry.

00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:05.210
They tend to call them
force fields in organics,

00:25:05.210 --> 00:25:07.160
but there really are potentials.

00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:11.360
And so there are a whole
sets of parameterizations

00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:13.190
that are available.

00:25:13.190 --> 00:25:16.220
And a lot of sort of
good codes will have

00:25:16.220 --> 00:25:17.977
many of these built in already.

00:25:17.977 --> 00:25:20.060
For example, there's
somewhere about [INAUDIBLE],,

00:25:20.060 --> 00:25:23.735
then there's the AMBER
force field, which will--

00:25:23.735 --> 00:25:26.150
you know, what they mean
with a force field is

00:25:26.150 --> 00:25:29.420
they will have potentials
for the most common bonds

00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:32.730
that you find, in this case,
in biology, but in general

00:25:32.730 --> 00:25:35.000
in organic chemistry.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:41.450
The CHARMM [INAUDIBLE] very
well, very often used one.

00:25:41.450 --> 00:25:43.340
CHARMM has
essentially potentials

00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:48.650
for almost all elements,
almost all light elements.

00:25:48.650 --> 00:25:53.155
So all these have been
parameterized for you.

00:25:53.155 --> 00:25:54.530
There's an
interesting discussion

00:25:54.530 --> 00:25:56.960
about all these force
fields on this website

00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:59.660
if you care to look
at it at some point.

00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:05.150
OK.

00:26:05.150 --> 00:26:09.110
So another field where
potentials have worked

00:26:09.110 --> 00:26:12.230
reasonably well as in oxides.

00:26:12.230 --> 00:26:18.080
Actually, oxides is probably
one of the earliest material

00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:23.030
classes in which there was very
extensive atomistic modeling

00:26:23.030 --> 00:26:25.760
going on.

00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:30.110
This goes way back to the
'60s before there were barely

00:26:30.110 --> 00:26:31.070
any usable computers.

00:26:31.070 --> 00:26:34.220
People were modeling oxides.

00:26:34.220 --> 00:26:37.130
And of course, people
weren't even thinking

00:26:37.130 --> 00:26:39.650
of doing quantum mechanics
computationally at the time.

00:26:39.650 --> 00:26:41.900
So they were using
empirical potential models.

00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:45.080
And the drive to work
on oxides was actually

00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:46.820
from the nuclear industry.

00:26:46.820 --> 00:26:49.520
There was one oxide in
particular they cared about.

00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:52.460
And that was uranium
oxide because it's

00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:55.880
an essential component
of your nuclear fuel.

00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:58.820
And this was one of
these early realizations

00:26:58.820 --> 00:27:01.580
that there's some stuff that was
much easier to do with modeling

00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:02.960
than to do experimentally.

00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:05.300
Doing experiments
on nuclear fuel rods

00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:08.670
is really kind of
painful and expensive.

00:27:08.670 --> 00:27:11.360
And so that's actually how
the modeling industry on oxide

00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:13.970
was born in the '60s
is to actually model

00:27:13.970 --> 00:27:16.430
point defects in uranium oxide.

00:27:16.430 --> 00:27:18.860
So it's a
well-established field.

00:27:18.860 --> 00:27:20.840
It's probably getting
superseded largely

00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:23.270
by doing quantum mechanics
now, but it's still

00:27:23.270 --> 00:27:26.840
sort of interesting to see
how reasonably well it works

00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:28.610
and what it doesn't work for.

00:27:28.610 --> 00:27:31.970
The standard, by all
means, is that you use

00:27:31.970 --> 00:27:34.280
a repulsive Buckingham term.

00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:38.690
So you have a potential that--

00:27:38.690 --> 00:27:42.020
so you have the
repulsive exponential.

00:27:42.020 --> 00:27:44.750
You have the van der Waals term.

00:27:44.750 --> 00:27:46.830
That's your
short-range potential.

00:27:46.830 --> 00:27:49.430
And then you do electrostatics
because, of course,

00:27:49.430 --> 00:27:51.230
you have charged
ions when doing that.

00:27:51.230 --> 00:27:54.500
And so the electrostatics
give you your cohesion.

00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:56.840
That's the one that wants
to bring the ions together.

00:27:56.840 --> 00:27:59.705
And the Buckingham term
gives you your repulsion.

00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:06.710
To sum the long range
electrostatic part,

00:28:06.710 --> 00:28:08.570
people can sum in real space.

00:28:08.570 --> 00:28:10.130
If you sum this in
real space, it's

00:28:10.130 --> 00:28:11.540
only conditionally convergent.

00:28:11.540 --> 00:28:14.240
And people use what's
called the Ewald method.

00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:16.940
It's something you'll
see when you use codes.

00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:18.680
There actually are
faster techniques now,

00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:21.132
but this is still
definitely a standard.

00:28:21.132 --> 00:28:22.590
We're not going to
go into details,

00:28:22.590 --> 00:28:24.680
but essentially the
Ewald way is a way

00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:29.990
of partitioning your
energy sum in real space

00:28:29.990 --> 00:28:33.800
and in reciprocal space,
so that both converge.

00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:36.110
You can actually show
that, in either space,

00:28:36.110 --> 00:28:38.180
it doesn't converge very well.

00:28:38.180 --> 00:28:40.580
In real space, 1 over
r doesn't converge.

00:28:40.580 --> 00:28:42.680
In reciprocal space, it
really doesn't converge

00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:44.210
when you Fourier transform it.

00:28:44.210 --> 00:28:46.250
But you can partition
it, so that it

00:28:46.250 --> 00:28:47.510
converges in both space.

00:28:47.510 --> 00:28:50.330
And you basically
have to sum it up.

00:28:54.790 --> 00:28:59.810
And an essential piece that
was added in the late '60,

00:28:59.810 --> 00:29:03.610
early '70s was polarization.

00:29:03.610 --> 00:29:06.400
An important thing in
oxides is that you have

00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:08.900
strong electrostatic fields.

00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:11.860
So when you put an electron
density in a field,

00:29:11.860 --> 00:29:13.360
it can polarize.

00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:16.090
And this is particularly
important for the oxygen ion.

00:29:16.090 --> 00:29:19.300
If you put the oxygen ion in a
non-symmetric position, so one

00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:23.920
where the field doesn't
vanish, an oxygen ion

00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:25.330
is highly negatively charged.

00:29:25.330 --> 00:29:27.230
It means it has a
lot of electrons.

00:29:27.230 --> 00:29:31.400
So the electron density
cloud will polarize.

00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:35.780
And the oxygen will
actually carry a dipole.

00:29:35.780 --> 00:29:39.440
And that was actually modeled
in a sort of very ingenious way,

00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:40.730
I thought.

00:29:40.730 --> 00:29:42.920
The way polarization
is included is

00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:45.740
by what's called a
shell and spring model.

00:29:45.740 --> 00:29:49.670
Essentially, you treat
the polarizable ion

00:29:49.670 --> 00:29:51.660
by two entities.

00:29:51.660 --> 00:29:54.620
It has a nucleus
with a charge on it,

00:29:54.620 --> 00:29:57.410
and it has a shell
with a charge on it.

00:29:57.410 --> 00:30:00.440
And the two charges sum
to the charge of the ion.

00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:04.760
So if this were oxygen,
this would be 2 minus then.

00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:08.930
But what you do is the two
can move independently,

00:30:08.930 --> 00:30:12.280
but they are
connected by a spring.

00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:15.430
So they can't completely wander
off, so they are connected.

00:30:15.430 --> 00:30:17.830
But what happens now
if you put-- say,

00:30:17.830 --> 00:30:22.570
if you put a field
on this, the positive

00:30:22.570 --> 00:30:25.550
and the negative charge will
move in opposite direction.

00:30:25.550 --> 00:30:28.720
So you may go to a state
where the center, qn,

00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:30.730
the center of the
positive charge is here.

00:30:30.730 --> 00:30:33.470
And that's the shell.

00:30:33.470 --> 00:30:37.750
And so, now, this would be the
center of the positive charge.

00:30:37.750 --> 00:30:41.110
And the center of the negative
charge would be shifted.

00:30:41.110 --> 00:30:42.415
And you would have a dipole.

00:30:44.938 --> 00:30:46.480
So does everybody
see how this works?

00:30:49.430 --> 00:30:53.440
So the polarizability of
the ion is essentially

00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:56.080
determined by the
charge difference

00:30:56.080 --> 00:30:59.140
between the shell and the core
and the spring between them.

00:30:59.140 --> 00:31:01.180
If the spring is
infinitely stiff,

00:31:01.180 --> 00:31:03.490
then you cannot
polarize the ion.

00:31:03.490 --> 00:31:07.930
If the spring is soft, then you
can polarize the ion very well.

00:31:07.930 --> 00:31:15.020
And that's actually how the
spring constant is fitted.

00:31:15.020 --> 00:31:16.900
It's fitted to the
polarizability, often,

00:31:16.900 --> 00:31:19.180
of the free ion.

00:31:19.180 --> 00:31:24.130
And I think this is
actually the polarization.

00:31:24.130 --> 00:31:27.100
Typically, what interacts
with the other ions

00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:29.290
through the short range
term is the shell model.

00:31:32.710 --> 00:31:35.500
Usually, when you model
oxides with potentials,

00:31:35.500 --> 00:31:40.600
you tend to put a shell and
spring only on the anions

00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:43.630
because it's obviously the
anion that's most polarizable.

00:31:43.630 --> 00:31:45.940
It has the biggest
electron density cloud.

00:31:45.940 --> 00:31:48.580
It has the electrons.

00:31:48.580 --> 00:31:50.560
And cations are much
less polarizable

00:31:50.560 --> 00:31:52.720
because they're cations.

00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:55.048
They have lost most of
their valence electrons.

00:31:55.048 --> 00:31:56.590
Especially something
like-- let's say

00:31:56.590 --> 00:31:59.440
you do MgO, magnesium oxide.

00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:04.850
Magnesium is 2+, so
magnesium is an outlier.

00:32:04.850 --> 00:32:06.640
So it's a bare core.

00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:08.380
If you strip off two
electrons, there's

00:32:08.380 --> 00:32:11.410
nothing left to polarize
unless you think you're

00:32:11.410 --> 00:32:12.622
going to polarize the core.

00:32:12.622 --> 00:32:14.080
So you would there
just put a shell

00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:17.470
on a spring on the oxygen.
This becomes very important

00:32:17.470 --> 00:32:20.320
when you work in low
symmetry environments.

00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:24.310
Because whether your
ion polarizes or not

00:32:24.310 --> 00:32:26.980
depends on whether the
symmetry allows it to polarize.

00:32:29.620 --> 00:32:33.370
If you are sitting in a
center of point symmetry,

00:32:33.370 --> 00:32:36.460
let's say you're sitting in an
inversion center of a crystal,

00:32:36.460 --> 00:32:38.350
I don't care how
polarizable you are.

00:32:38.350 --> 00:32:42.160
The symmetry doesn't
allow you to polarize.

00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:45.490
But so it's when you do low
symmetry calculation, defects,

00:32:45.490 --> 00:32:50.140
surfaces, that polarizability
becomes quite important.

00:32:54.770 --> 00:32:56.830
So I wanted to show
you a real example.

00:32:56.830 --> 00:32:58.900
This is something we kind
of quickly calculated

00:32:58.900 --> 00:33:00.760
ourselves a few years ago.

00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:03.190
That's why it looks
like a crummy graph.

00:33:03.190 --> 00:33:05.890
Because this is the phonon
density of state for magnesium

00:33:05.890 --> 00:33:08.560
oxide with and
without polarization.

00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:10.720
So what this is is
really this axis

00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:13.010
is the frequency of the phonons.

00:33:13.010 --> 00:33:16.700
And this is the
density of states,

00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:19.910
how many phonons there are
with that frequency of energy.

00:33:19.910 --> 00:33:21.530
And essentially,
what you see is that,

00:33:21.530 --> 00:33:25.720
when you have no
polarization, you

00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:29.410
have a high frequency
tail of phonons.

00:33:29.410 --> 00:33:31.720
And remember, phonons--
even though MgO

00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:35.680
is a highly symmetric
crystal, the energy of phonons

00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:37.510
is determined by
low symmetry things.

00:33:37.510 --> 00:33:40.180
Because, you know, think of
a displacement of a phonon.

00:33:40.180 --> 00:33:44.010
You're now breaking the
translational symmetry.

00:33:44.010 --> 00:33:46.860
So you're not into
high symmetry 0 Kelvin

00:33:46.860 --> 00:33:49.440
crystalline environment
anymore, so polarization

00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:50.370
becomes relevant.

00:33:50.370 --> 00:33:53.340
When you turn on
polarization of the anions,

00:33:53.340 --> 00:33:56.290
you essentially dampen away
those high frequencies.

00:33:56.290 --> 00:33:56.790
OK.

00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:07.410
Let me actually, just
before I go here, come back

00:34:07.410 --> 00:34:14.489
to the issue of polarization is
important to take into account

00:34:14.489 --> 00:34:17.150
when you fit.

00:34:17.150 --> 00:34:20.330
There are people who
will show you potentials

00:34:20.330 --> 00:34:22.352
fit to the equation of state.

00:34:22.352 --> 00:34:23.810
So does everybody
know what I mean?

00:34:23.810 --> 00:34:25.820
The equation of state, I
mean literally the energy

00:34:25.820 --> 00:34:27.653
of the system as a
function of state lattice

00:34:27.653 --> 00:34:28.739
parameter or volume.

00:34:28.739 --> 00:34:32.000
So let's say I took MgO,
magnesium oxides or rock salt.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:35.120
I could really, let's say,
have initial calculations

00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:36.530
of different lattice parameters.

00:34:36.530 --> 00:34:38.596
And that would give
me a curve, energy

00:34:38.596 --> 00:34:39.679
versus lattice parameters.

00:34:39.679 --> 00:34:42.139
I could fit my
potential to that.

00:34:42.139 --> 00:34:45.409
If I do that, I have never
included any polarization

00:34:45.409 --> 00:34:47.280
effects.

00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:49.320
Because at every
lattice parameter,

00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:53.340
that is still a
high symmetry state.

00:34:53.340 --> 00:34:55.320
At none of these
lattice parameters

00:34:55.320 --> 00:34:58.110
is any of the ions
ever polarized,

00:34:58.110 --> 00:35:01.480
ever have a dipole moment on it.

00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:03.870
And so what you see
then, when you go and do

00:35:03.870 --> 00:35:06.330
defect calculations
with that potential,

00:35:06.330 --> 00:35:09.680
you will almost always
overestimate their energy.

00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:11.330
And the reason is
you've taken away

00:35:11.330 --> 00:35:14.390
a degree of freedom
of the system.

00:35:14.390 --> 00:35:17.010
If you actually then
calculate a defect,

00:35:17.010 --> 00:35:19.310
the system wants to polarize,
but you haven't given it

00:35:19.310 --> 00:35:21.750
the option because you haven't
included it in your model.

00:35:21.750 --> 00:35:23.570
So I would say be
aware of people who

00:35:23.570 --> 00:35:25.250
show you equations of state.

00:35:25.250 --> 00:35:28.790
You know, everybody can fit an
equation of state, everybody.

00:35:28.790 --> 00:35:33.030
You know, any potential that has
more than one fitting parameter

00:35:33.030 --> 00:35:35.250
can fit an equation of state.

00:35:35.250 --> 00:35:38.490
It's the low symmetry details,
surface energies, defects,

00:35:38.490 --> 00:35:39.900
that are hard to reproduce.

00:35:43.470 --> 00:35:45.300
These days, just
like in organics,

00:35:45.300 --> 00:35:47.850
there are very good sources
of potentials for oxides.

00:35:47.850 --> 00:35:50.680
You don't really have
to go and fit your own.

00:35:50.680 --> 00:35:54.120
This is one paper that sort
of collected a bunch of them,

00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:55.697
which is a paper by Bush.

00:35:55.697 --> 00:35:57.030
They're actually on the web now.

00:35:57.030 --> 00:35:59.740
You can literally download
them in the format

00:35:59.740 --> 00:36:02.460
right away that's relevant
for a particular code,

00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:04.650
the set of standardized codes.

00:36:04.650 --> 00:36:07.680
The one we'll use in
the lab is called GULP,

00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:11.010
which is free for academics.

00:36:11.010 --> 00:36:15.120
But even other codes you can
pretty much get the form often

00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:17.670
right off the web.

00:36:17.670 --> 00:36:18.862
OK.

00:36:18.862 --> 00:36:22.590
Oh, this is actually one of
the tables in that paper.

00:36:22.590 --> 00:36:25.957
All I'm showing you this is that
you can see that they actually

00:36:25.957 --> 00:36:26.790
have the parameters.

00:36:26.790 --> 00:36:28.230
So this is the
parameter in front

00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:31.440
of the exponential between
the cation and the anion.

00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:33.485
This is the one in
the exponential.

00:36:33.485 --> 00:36:38.160
Remember, it's a
exponential minus r overall.

00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:41.400
This would be the
polarization, the core,

00:36:41.400 --> 00:36:42.900
and the shell polarization.

00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:45.850
In this case, on
some of the cations,

00:36:45.850 --> 00:36:47.550
they put it on as well.

00:36:47.550 --> 00:36:50.550
On the alkalis, they
didn't fit a polarization,

00:36:50.550 --> 00:36:53.640
since they're really not
very polarizable if you

00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:55.792
see lithium, sodium, potassium.

00:36:55.792 --> 00:36:57.250
But on some of the
heavier cations,

00:36:57.250 --> 00:37:00.510
they did fit polarization terms.

00:37:00.510 --> 00:37:02.010
But the main
important polarization

00:37:02.010 --> 00:37:03.552
is the one on the
oxygen. So you have

00:37:03.552 --> 00:37:08.010
a core charge and a shell
charge and a spring constant.

00:37:08.010 --> 00:37:10.950
This is actually the
anion spring constant.

00:37:10.950 --> 00:37:12.510
The nice thing about
these potentials

00:37:12.510 --> 00:37:15.210
is that they were
fit all together.

00:37:15.210 --> 00:37:20.890
They actually fitted all these
potentials, the cation, anion,

00:37:20.890 --> 00:37:24.258
and the anion-ion terms
all in one massive fitting.

00:37:24.258 --> 00:37:25.800
And what that means
is that they have

00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:28.860
a consistent
anion-anion potential

00:37:28.860 --> 00:37:30.960
across multiple oxides.

00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:32.820
The problem with fitting
potentials in oxide

00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:36.450
has always been the
oxygen-oxygen one.

00:37:36.450 --> 00:37:39.700
Because in an oxide,
the oxygens are big.

00:37:39.700 --> 00:37:41.520
They're about 1.4 angstrom.

00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:43.060
A cation is small.

00:37:43.060 --> 00:37:45.600
Like, magnesium is,
say, 0.7 angstrom.

00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:49.680
So really an oxide is big
oxygens touching each other

00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:52.390
and the cations sitting in
the spaces between them.

00:37:52.390 --> 00:37:54.180
So the potential
between the oxygens

00:37:54.180 --> 00:37:57.600
is always the one
that kind of sets

00:37:57.600 --> 00:38:01.770
a lot of your dynamical effects,
a lot of your lattice parameter

00:38:01.770 --> 00:38:02.290
effects.

00:38:02.290 --> 00:38:05.640
So it's the one that's
hardest to deal with.

00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:07.080
It's also the problem.

00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:09.630
If there's a reason that
this sometimes fails,

00:38:09.630 --> 00:38:12.960
it's often because of
the anion potential.

00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:15.870
Even though we think
of oxygen as a 2- ion,

00:38:15.870 --> 00:38:19.380
it turns out it's actually
a very fluffy ion.

00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:24.510
That last p electron you
put on it to make it 2-

00:38:24.510 --> 00:38:27.540
is actually not stably
bound in a vacuum.

00:38:27.540 --> 00:38:30.450
It's bound largely by
the electrostatic field

00:38:30.450 --> 00:38:31.980
in the crystal.

00:38:31.980 --> 00:38:35.310
Remember, from the cations
comes a positive field.

00:38:35.310 --> 00:38:37.680
So the electron really wants
to be there on the oxygen.

00:38:37.680 --> 00:38:40.360
And that's what binds
the last p electron.

00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:41.790
So the problem
with the oxygen is

00:38:41.790 --> 00:38:45.240
that it relaxes
its wave functions

00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:46.300
depending on environment.

00:38:46.300 --> 00:38:48.160
So it's not a hard ion at all.

00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:50.340
And that's often
referred to as breeding.

00:38:50.340 --> 00:38:51.125
The oxygen breeds.

00:38:51.125 --> 00:38:53.250
So what that really means--
that the oxygen doesn't

00:38:53.250 --> 00:38:56.550
have the same size in
different environments.

00:38:56.550 --> 00:38:59.540
And this is where it gets
problematic for potentials

00:38:59.540 --> 00:39:01.540
because you model your
potential with, remember,

00:39:01.540 --> 00:39:04.740
this Buckingham potential, which
has a well-defined minimum.

00:39:04.740 --> 00:39:07.960
It sort of treats the oxygen
as the same every time,

00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:10.650
but this breeding basically
messes that up somewhat,

00:39:10.650 --> 00:39:13.770
that your oxygen has
somewhat different sides

00:39:13.770 --> 00:39:14.910
in different environments.

00:39:14.910 --> 00:39:19.350
If you're doing monoxides,
you pick that up

00:39:19.350 --> 00:39:22.950
in that difference in the
cation anion potential.

00:39:22.950 --> 00:39:26.445
If you're just comparing, say,
MgO and CaO, magnesium oxide

00:39:26.445 --> 00:39:29.520
and calcium oxide,
you can pick up

00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:32.640
the inconsistency between
the oxygen-oxygen potential

00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:36.330
in the two by modifying
the metal oxygen

00:39:36.330 --> 00:39:37.680
potential somewhat.

00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:40.530
But it's going to do complicated
oxides with a lot of metals.

00:39:40.530 --> 00:39:45.600
And at the same time you quite
can't play that game anymore.

00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:49.710
This is the charge density of
the oxygen in calcium oxide.

00:39:49.710 --> 00:39:51.990
And on the same scale,
this is the charge density

00:39:51.990 --> 00:39:53.610
in magnesium oxide.

00:39:53.610 --> 00:39:57.300
If you actually see,
it's not quite the same.

00:39:57.300 --> 00:40:00.060
It's actually not nearly as
spherical in calcium oxide

00:40:00.060 --> 00:40:02.070
as in magnesium oxide.

00:40:02.070 --> 00:40:04.900
And calcium is bigger.

00:40:04.900 --> 00:40:10.780
And these are in exactly
the same structure.

00:40:10.780 --> 00:40:14.710
The last one is really
the more problematic one,

00:40:14.710 --> 00:40:19.450
is that most oxides are
actually-- more and more,

00:40:19.450 --> 00:40:22.090
we find out that they
are less hard in valence

00:40:22.090 --> 00:40:23.650
than we thought they were.

00:40:23.650 --> 00:40:26.950
We always think of oxides as
there's 2- on the oxygens.

00:40:26.950 --> 00:40:30.340
And then I figured out
what my cation charge is.

00:40:30.340 --> 00:40:32.590
And for lithium, it's 1+.

00:40:32.590 --> 00:40:34.750
For magnesium, it's 2+.

00:40:34.750 --> 00:40:37.660
What we find more and more
is that the ions really don't

00:40:37.660 --> 00:40:40.480
have full charge in oxides.

00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:45.670
So what I showed you here, this
is mixtures of zirconium oxide

00:40:45.670 --> 00:40:47.570
and calcium oxide.

00:40:47.570 --> 00:40:51.010
And what is shown, the negative
numbers that are shown,

00:40:51.010 --> 00:40:55.152
are the charges on the
oxygen. And what you see

00:40:55.152 --> 00:40:56.860
is that they're kind
of all over the map.

00:40:56.860 --> 00:41:01.290
They depend, essentially, on
what cations are around them.

00:41:01.290 --> 00:41:02.910
Zirconium is 4+.

00:41:02.910 --> 00:41:04.770
Calcium is 2+.

00:41:04.770 --> 00:41:07.230
So if you actually have a
lot of zirconium around,

00:41:07.230 --> 00:41:10.620
you tend to make the
oxygen more negative than

00:41:10.620 --> 00:41:13.050
if you have calcium around you.

00:41:13.050 --> 00:41:16.260
And so what this
essentially means

00:41:16.260 --> 00:41:19.500
is that, when you do
empirical potential modeling

00:41:19.500 --> 00:41:23.530
and you use full
charges, in some sense,

00:41:23.530 --> 00:41:25.470
your energetics is too harsh.

00:41:25.470 --> 00:41:28.320
You tend to
overestimate energies

00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:31.560
because you have too large an
electrostatic contribution.

00:41:31.560 --> 00:41:34.650
In reality, when you treat
the full electron density

00:41:34.650 --> 00:41:37.080
in quantum mechanics,
the electron density

00:41:37.080 --> 00:41:40.200
will relax away a little
from these full charges

00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:45.500
and, thereby, sort of moderate
the electrostatic effect.

00:41:45.500 --> 00:41:48.950
So this is probably
the hardest problem

00:41:48.950 --> 00:41:54.760
in modeling oxides of
empirical potentials.

00:41:54.760 --> 00:41:56.680
This becomes
extremely problematic

00:41:56.680 --> 00:42:00.310
when you do transition metal
oxides because transition metal

00:42:00.310 --> 00:42:02.260
have variable valence.

00:42:02.260 --> 00:42:04.570
Magnesium, at least, we
always think of as 2+.

00:42:04.570 --> 00:42:06.910
But what if you're
doing iron oxides?

00:42:06.910 --> 00:42:09.550
Iron can be 2+, 3+, or 4+.

00:42:09.550 --> 00:42:12.940
And at some point, you will
do conformation changes

00:42:12.940 --> 00:42:15.640
in your material, and
your valence will change.

00:42:15.640 --> 00:42:17.950
And you can't deal with
that in a pair potential

00:42:17.950 --> 00:42:20.170
because it's the
same as in organics.

00:42:20.170 --> 00:42:24.370
A 2+ and a 3+ iron have a
different potential with oxygen

00:42:24.370 --> 00:42:26.480
because they have a
different repulsion.

00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:29.500
And so there are people who
have tried to make models

00:42:29.500 --> 00:42:34.500
with variable charge where you
have literally the short range

00:42:34.500 --> 00:42:36.840
repulsion, the
electrostatic term,

00:42:36.840 --> 00:42:39.660
and then a kind of
ionization term.

00:42:39.660 --> 00:42:44.340
So you would actually minimize
not just over atomic positions,

00:42:44.340 --> 00:42:46.440
but also over
charges on the ions.

00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:47.940
So there would be
some function that

00:42:47.940 --> 00:42:50.610
tells you how hard it is to
pull an electron off and put it

00:42:50.610 --> 00:42:51.540
on another.

00:42:51.540 --> 00:42:53.040
It's just that after
a while you run

00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:54.908
into so many fitting problems.

00:42:54.908 --> 00:42:56.700
The more parameters
you have in your model,

00:42:56.700 --> 00:42:59.010
the more things you have to
fit that you have to wonder

00:42:59.010 --> 00:43:01.980
whether it's worth doing that.

00:43:01.980 --> 00:43:04.572
And these models have not
sort of caught on in general.

00:43:04.572 --> 00:43:06.780
If you're interested, I can
give you some references,

00:43:06.780 --> 00:43:12.880
but they're not quite
in widespread use.

00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:14.380
So I kind of talked
about this here,

00:43:14.380 --> 00:43:15.850
the limitations
of pair potentials

00:43:15.850 --> 00:43:18.900
in oxides, the oxygen
change, the charge effect,

00:43:18.900 --> 00:43:20.670
and so many body effects.

00:43:20.670 --> 00:43:22.470
So let me sort of
summarize this,

00:43:22.470 --> 00:43:27.470
and then I'll hand over
Professor Marzari what

00:43:27.470 --> 00:43:29.700
I think we've seen.

00:43:29.700 --> 00:43:33.020
So in metals, you have
the issue of coordination.

00:43:33.020 --> 00:43:34.670
If you should
remember one thing,

00:43:34.670 --> 00:43:38.960
it's bond strength
depends on coordination.

00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:41.083
And you should remember
how that showed up

00:43:41.083 --> 00:43:43.250
in things like vacancy
formation energies and things

00:43:43.250 --> 00:43:44.292
like surface contraction.

00:43:44.292 --> 00:43:47.030
When you make a surface, the
layers tend to contract in.

00:43:47.030 --> 00:43:50.090
So if you have less
bonds, they're stronger.

00:43:50.090 --> 00:43:53.750
And that's the problem
for pair potentials.

00:43:53.750 --> 00:43:55.610
And methods like
embedded atom method

00:43:55.610 --> 00:43:58.160
do a great job of
fixing that problem.

00:43:58.160 --> 00:44:00.290
They're still missing
a lot of things.

00:44:00.290 --> 00:44:02.870
They don't have, in the end,
subtle electronic hybridization

00:44:02.870 --> 00:44:03.230
effects.

00:44:03.230 --> 00:44:05.180
So you still won't get
everything out of them,

00:44:05.180 --> 00:44:06.950
but they fixed
that main problem.

00:44:06.950 --> 00:44:09.140
In organic molecules,
the reason you're saved

00:44:09.140 --> 00:44:12.650
is because essentially you have
a limited set of environments.

00:44:12.650 --> 00:44:14.930
And you really parameterize
for each of them.

00:44:14.930 --> 00:44:18.140
And people have essentially
done that for you.

00:44:18.140 --> 00:44:20.000
The work is done.

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:24.650
In oxides, I would say
they're sort of in between.

00:44:24.650 --> 00:44:27.260
You do reasonably
well for things

00:44:27.260 --> 00:44:30.490
that are sort of gross
topological changes.

00:44:30.490 --> 00:44:33.100
But because of the variable
charge effect, the oxygen

00:44:33.100 --> 00:44:36.220
breeding, and sometimes
charge transfer,

00:44:36.220 --> 00:44:39.560
you will miss that
subtle energetic effect.

00:44:39.560 --> 00:44:41.800
The other thing is that,
in transition metals,

00:44:41.800 --> 00:44:43.420
you often have magnetic moments.

00:44:43.420 --> 00:44:46.780
In transition metals, you have
a lot of unpaired electrons

00:44:46.780 --> 00:44:49.600
because the orbitals
are very localized.

00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:52.700
So you will tend to populate
them following Hund's rules.

00:44:52.700 --> 00:44:55.240
So you will tend to build up
magnetic moments on the ions.

00:44:55.240 --> 00:44:57.160
And so you will have
magnetic interactions.

00:44:57.160 --> 00:45:01.510
And these are almost never
dealt with in pair potentials.

00:45:01.510 --> 00:45:05.800
So I'm going to hand off here to
Professor Marzari, who's going

00:45:05.800 --> 00:45:07.987
to teach you quantum mechanics.

00:45:07.987 --> 00:45:09.070
NICOLA MARZARI: Excellent.

00:45:09.070 --> 00:45:13.100
So welcome to the second
part of the lecture.

00:45:13.100 --> 00:45:16.240
What we are going to see
in the next few classes

00:45:16.240 --> 00:45:18.670
are actually electronic
structure methods

00:45:18.670 --> 00:45:20.380
for modeling materials.

00:45:20.380 --> 00:45:22.540
And what I've
decided to do today

00:45:22.540 --> 00:45:26.170
is really just a brief
introduction and a refresher

00:45:26.170 --> 00:45:28.480
of quantum mechanics
or just an introduction

00:45:28.480 --> 00:45:29.860
if you haven't seen before.

00:45:29.860 --> 00:45:31.900
And this is mostly
because, at the end,

00:45:31.900 --> 00:45:34.480
electronic structure
methods involves

00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:37.420
the solution of a
Schrodinger equation

00:45:37.420 --> 00:45:39.770
or a relative of the
Schrodinger equation.

00:45:39.770 --> 00:45:42.460
And so I wanted to
remind you about that.

00:45:42.460 --> 00:45:45.970
This is sort of what we can do
more or less easily nowadays.

00:45:45.970 --> 00:45:48.520
This is a system with
a few hundred atoms.

00:45:48.520 --> 00:45:51.400
It's actually myoglobin
with a carbon monoxide

00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:53.660
molecules attached to it.

00:45:53.660 --> 00:45:55.990
And it's the kind
of calculation that

00:45:55.990 --> 00:46:01.690
would take a day or so on
a smaller research cluster.

00:46:01.690 --> 00:46:05.410
It's also a calculation that
basically predicts that we all

00:46:05.410 --> 00:46:07.840
would be dead in a
nanosecond or so,

00:46:07.840 --> 00:46:11.740
just because the error in the
binding energy of that molecule

00:46:11.740 --> 00:46:14.170
that you get with the standard
quantum mechanical method

00:46:14.170 --> 00:46:19.220
is actually not enough to sort
of compare with experiments.

00:46:19.220 --> 00:46:23.530
So let's see a few cases
in sort of which we

00:46:23.530 --> 00:46:28.060
think quantum mechanical
simulations are very relevant.

00:46:28.060 --> 00:46:32.380
The first case is one of
structure and bonding.

00:46:32.380 --> 00:46:36.310
Basically, a solid or a
molecule stays together

00:46:36.310 --> 00:46:39.370
because there is an
electronic glue that

00:46:39.370 --> 00:46:42.910
compensate the repulsion
between the nuclei.

00:46:42.910 --> 00:46:46.060
And the structure and stability
of different structures

00:46:46.060 --> 00:46:48.130
is determined by
the compensation

00:46:48.130 --> 00:46:49.950
of repulsive effects.

00:46:49.950 --> 00:46:51.940
So all nuclear repel each other.

00:46:51.940 --> 00:46:55.660
All electrons repel each
other, but nuclei and electrons

00:46:55.660 --> 00:46:57.310
attract each other.

00:46:57.310 --> 00:47:01.120
And say, here we are seeing
two different structures.

00:47:01.120 --> 00:47:03.700
On the left is the
high temperature

00:47:03.700 --> 00:47:06.040
cubic phase of lead titanite.

00:47:06.040 --> 00:47:08.440
And on the right, we
have the low temperature

00:47:08.440 --> 00:47:11.140
ferroelectric phase
of lead titanite.

00:47:11.140 --> 00:47:13.720
And you see it has
very subtle differences

00:47:13.720 --> 00:47:17.680
and very subtle differences
in the charge density.

00:47:17.680 --> 00:47:20.050
At the end, a solid
is really made

00:47:20.050 --> 00:47:23.800
by spherical atoms
that sort of interfere

00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:27.430
very lightly, destructively,
or constructively.

00:47:27.430 --> 00:47:30.190
And here you can see
sort of affirmation

00:47:30.190 --> 00:47:34.030
of some kind of stronger bond
between the white oxygen,

00:47:34.030 --> 00:47:37.510
in this case, and
the green lead atoms.

00:47:37.510 --> 00:47:39.400
And we are at the
stage in which sort

00:47:39.400 --> 00:47:43.390
of state of the art electronic
structure approaches

00:47:43.390 --> 00:47:47.230
are actually able to calculate
accurately these energy

00:47:47.230 --> 00:47:48.130
differences.

00:47:48.130 --> 00:47:51.160
And so they can give you
the zero temperature phase

00:47:51.160 --> 00:47:52.190
stability.

00:47:52.190 --> 00:47:54.770
And as you learn in
the rest of the class,

00:47:54.770 --> 00:47:57.310
once you have a good
energetic model,

00:47:57.310 --> 00:47:59.500
you can also calculate
the thermodynamics.

00:47:59.500 --> 00:48:03.070
Basically, thermodynamics
is the statistical mechanics

00:48:03.070 --> 00:48:05.710
of the thermal excitation
for such a system.

00:48:09.660 --> 00:48:12.230
Another case in which
electronic structure methods

00:48:12.230 --> 00:48:15.080
are obviously important
is when you are actually

00:48:15.080 --> 00:48:18.380
interested in electronic
structure properties.

00:48:18.380 --> 00:48:20.870
So if you want to
calculate or predict

00:48:20.870 --> 00:48:23.300
electronic properties,
optical properties,

00:48:23.300 --> 00:48:26.150
and, to a large extent,
magnetic properties,

00:48:26.150 --> 00:48:27.735
you really can't
use a potential.

00:48:27.735 --> 00:48:30.200
A potential, if anything,
gives you a structure,

00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:32.990
but will never give you
the electronic excitation.

00:48:32.990 --> 00:48:35.570
And this is actually a beautiful
case from recent research.

00:48:35.570 --> 00:48:39.200
This is from Professor Bawendi
in the chemistry department.

00:48:39.200 --> 00:48:41.540
And what you are
seeing here is actually

00:48:41.540 --> 00:48:46.130
a suspension of cadmium
selenides nanoparticles.

00:48:46.130 --> 00:48:49.250
And to a large extent,
the optical excitation

00:48:49.250 --> 00:48:52.010
can actually be modeled
just by the excitation

00:48:52.010 --> 00:48:55.010
of an electron confined
in a spherical potential.

00:48:55.010 --> 00:48:57.283
Also, one can do sort
of better than that.

00:48:57.283 --> 00:48:58.700
But what's happening
here is that,

00:48:58.700 --> 00:49:02.780
depending on the size, the
spacing between the excited

00:49:02.780 --> 00:49:03.770
level changes.

00:49:03.770 --> 00:49:06.080
And basically,
this system absorbs

00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:08.220
light in different ways.

00:49:08.220 --> 00:49:12.120
And so they can actually make
for great chemical sensors.

00:49:12.120 --> 00:49:14.240
And this is, again,
electronic properties

00:49:14.240 --> 00:49:16.850
is what we predict
with quantum mechanics.

00:49:16.850 --> 00:49:22.550
And finally, we can follow
chemical bonding, chemical

00:49:22.550 --> 00:49:25.560
breaking and chemical
forming reactions.

00:49:25.560 --> 00:49:28.350
So say you want to study
a chemical reaction.

00:49:28.350 --> 00:49:31.320
And this is a sort of classic
case for organic chemistry.

00:49:31.320 --> 00:49:33.980
This is a cycloaddition
reaction or what

00:49:33.980 --> 00:49:37.160
is called a Diels-Alder
reaction in which, basically,

00:49:37.160 --> 00:49:39.800
an ethylene molecule
break apart,

00:49:39.800 --> 00:49:42.357
and we form an aromatic bond.

00:49:42.357 --> 00:49:43.940
Well, this is something
that you could

00:49:43.940 --> 00:49:45.660
do with quantum mechanics.

00:49:45.660 --> 00:49:48.650
This is a picture that comes
from Bill Goddard's site in Cal

00:49:48.650 --> 00:49:49.310
Tech.

00:49:49.310 --> 00:49:51.590
And you see we are
actually following

00:49:51.590 --> 00:49:55.730
the highest occupied molecular
orbital as the reaction

00:49:55.730 --> 00:49:56.690
proceeds.

00:49:56.690 --> 00:49:59.750
And this is really the reason
why a potential wouldn't

00:49:59.750 --> 00:50:03.020
be able to describe
this to a large extent

00:50:03.020 --> 00:50:05.690
because what is
taking place is really

00:50:05.690 --> 00:50:09.080
a reorganization of
the electronic state.

00:50:09.080 --> 00:50:13.280
You see, ultimately, it's really
constructive and destructive

00:50:13.280 --> 00:50:16.520
interference of
electrons as standing

00:50:16.520 --> 00:50:20.420
waves in this potential that
determine the stability.

00:50:20.420 --> 00:50:22.370
And again, this is
sort of done with sort

00:50:22.370 --> 00:50:26.850
of current state of the art
electronics structure methods.

00:50:26.850 --> 00:50:29.120
So this is what we are
going to learn, basically.

00:50:29.120 --> 00:50:33.020
And a picture that I always
want you to have in mind

00:50:33.020 --> 00:50:35.930
is what I call the
standard model of matter.

00:50:35.930 --> 00:50:39.420
That is everything you
look at, a beta solid,

00:50:39.420 --> 00:50:43.130
a gas, or a molecule,
ultimately can

00:50:43.130 --> 00:50:45.730
be described as sort of
the current condition,

00:50:45.730 --> 00:50:48.170
so at the sort of
average energy that

00:50:48.170 --> 00:50:52.040
is typical of room
temperature or sort of roughly

00:50:52.040 --> 00:50:55.940
orders of magnitude
above and below it.

00:50:55.940 --> 00:50:59.630
First of all, by
ionic nuclei, that

00:50:59.630 --> 00:51:03.200
is really where all the mass
of your system is concentrated.

00:51:03.200 --> 00:51:06.950
Remember, a sort of nucleus as
actually a typical size of 10

00:51:06.950 --> 00:51:10.820
to the minus 14, 10 to
the minus 15 meters.

00:51:10.820 --> 00:51:14.510
But it's really where
all the mass lies.

00:51:14.510 --> 00:51:15.740
And the amazing thing--

00:51:15.740 --> 00:51:17.150
I always find this amazing--

00:51:17.150 --> 00:51:21.560
is that to a large extent,
even for a nucleus,

00:51:21.560 --> 00:51:25.610
Newton's equation of
motion still apply.

00:51:25.610 --> 00:51:27.290
I mean, in reality,
there are sort

00:51:27.290 --> 00:51:29.960
of a number of subtle
quantum effects.

00:51:29.960 --> 00:51:33.530
We'll mention this sort of
in the course of this class.

00:51:33.530 --> 00:51:36.020
But for all practical
purposes, you

00:51:36.020 --> 00:51:38.510
should start thinking
as this nuclei

00:51:38.510 --> 00:51:41.960
as behaving as
classical particles

00:51:41.960 --> 00:51:46.200
and moving around following the
Newton's equation of motion.

00:51:46.200 --> 00:51:49.100
So they have a mass,
and they feel a force.

00:51:49.100 --> 00:51:51.650
And the force that
they feel is basically

00:51:51.650 --> 00:51:54.830
a repulsive force from
all the other nuclei

00:51:54.830 --> 00:52:02.390
and the attractive force
from this electronic glue.

00:52:02.390 --> 00:52:06.240
These nuclei are actually
surrounded by electrons.

00:52:06.240 --> 00:52:07.690
When you study the
periodic table,

00:52:07.690 --> 00:52:10.370
you have studied all
the orbital shells.

00:52:10.370 --> 00:52:17.210
And really what happens is that
all the lowest core electrons

00:52:17.210 --> 00:52:21.140
are so tightly bound
that they really do not

00:52:21.140 --> 00:52:26.210
sort of change in the process of
the forming of a chemical bond

00:52:26.210 --> 00:52:28.290
or the breaking of
a chemical bond.

00:52:28.290 --> 00:52:32.630
So say, if you are thinking at
any sort of second row element,

00:52:32.630 --> 00:52:35.390
carbon, nitrogen,
oxygen, well, we

00:52:35.390 --> 00:52:39.140
know that there are 1s
electrons in there, sort

00:52:39.140 --> 00:52:41.030
of the one that we
have first filled.

00:52:41.030 --> 00:52:43.700
Those 1s electrons
are core electrons.

00:52:43.700 --> 00:52:47.930
And they really do not change
in the evolution of this system,

00:52:47.930 --> 00:52:52.582
unless we are really at energy
so high that we can start sort

00:52:52.582 --> 00:52:54.290
of kicking those
around, but that doesn't

00:52:54.290 --> 00:52:56.520
happen for practical purposes.

00:52:56.520 --> 00:52:59.000
So again, in your
standard model of matter,

00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:03.830
you need to think the nucleus
surrounded by very tightly

00:53:03.830 --> 00:53:06.980
bound shell of electrons.

00:53:06.980 --> 00:53:10.040
And it's really only
the outer electrons,

00:53:10.040 --> 00:53:12.590
what we call the
valence electrons, that

00:53:12.590 --> 00:53:18.560
are those are so lightly bound
to the nucleus that can start

00:53:18.560 --> 00:53:22.790
creating constructive and
destructive interference when

00:53:22.790 --> 00:53:24.770
they fill another nucleus.

00:53:24.770 --> 00:53:27.980
And so they create
chemical bonds.

00:53:27.980 --> 00:53:30.410
See, if you just look
at the, say, charge

00:53:30.410 --> 00:53:33.170
density in something
like platinum,

00:53:33.170 --> 00:53:35.600
this is sort of a
platinum surface

00:53:35.600 --> 00:53:37.962
to which a methane molecule
is attached to sort

00:53:37.962 --> 00:53:40.190
of the beginning of catalysis.

00:53:40.190 --> 00:53:42.620
You see, at the
end, what we have

00:53:42.620 --> 00:53:47.785
we have spherical atoms with
very, very tiny bonding.

00:53:47.785 --> 00:53:49.910
And again, it's not very
different from the picture

00:53:49.910 --> 00:53:54.830
that we have seen before of the
oxygen atom in calcium oxide.

00:53:54.830 --> 00:53:58.490
Obviously, all the relevant
energy is in this bonding.

00:53:58.490 --> 00:54:01.790
The difference between platinum
in the metal state or, say,

00:54:01.790 --> 00:54:04.580
a platinum atom
solvated in water,

00:54:04.580 --> 00:54:07.400
is the difference in
this chemical bonding.

00:54:07.400 --> 00:54:10.940
So studying what happens
here is very important.

00:54:10.940 --> 00:54:14.780
But to a large extent, this
sort of general picture

00:54:14.780 --> 00:54:18.080
of the charge density of
the atom being spherical

00:54:18.080 --> 00:54:18.710
is conserved.

00:54:18.710 --> 00:54:21.470
It's even in a
covalently bonded system.

00:54:21.470 --> 00:54:24.170
This is a metallic
bonded system, platinum.

00:54:24.170 --> 00:54:27.290
Up here, we have a covalent
bonded system that is methane.

00:54:27.290 --> 00:54:29.600
And again, to a
large extent, you

00:54:29.600 --> 00:54:32.510
see the spheres
that are the atoms.

00:54:32.510 --> 00:54:35.390
But all what we care
in understanding

00:54:35.390 --> 00:54:37.340
the stability of
different structure

00:54:37.340 --> 00:54:41.060
is actually what those
last valence electrons do.

00:54:41.060 --> 00:54:43.310
And obviously, those are
the lastly bound one.

00:54:43.310 --> 00:54:47.510
When you start sort of creating
an atom, you have a nucleus.

00:54:47.510 --> 00:54:49.340
And you start putting electrons.

00:54:49.340 --> 00:54:51.510
You fill up sort
of all the levels.

00:54:51.510 --> 00:54:55.550
The first one are incredibly
tightly bound to the nucleus.

00:54:55.550 --> 00:54:58.640
And then the more you
add, the more these

00:54:58.640 --> 00:55:01.350
electrons screen the nucleus.

00:55:01.350 --> 00:55:03.230
And so the next
electrons are going

00:55:03.230 --> 00:55:06.080
to see less and less
attractive charge to the point

00:55:06.080 --> 00:55:08.180
that the last electron
sees really very

00:55:08.180 --> 00:55:09.500
little attractive charge.

00:55:09.500 --> 00:55:11.930
And so it's a valence
electron ready to bind.

00:55:11.930 --> 00:55:13.350
Yes.

00:55:13.350 --> 00:55:17.850
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:55:17.850 --> 00:55:19.380
NICOLA MARZARI:
Very, very good--

00:55:19.380 --> 00:55:22.230
this is the difference
between if you

00:55:22.230 --> 00:55:24.870
want the classical
behavior of particle

00:55:24.870 --> 00:55:28.020
and the quantum mechanical
behavior of particle.

00:55:28.020 --> 00:55:31.800
Ultimately, I like to think
of it as the indetermination

00:55:31.800 --> 00:55:32.520
principle.

00:55:32.520 --> 00:55:36.810
That is, if the electron
were to fall on the nucleus,

00:55:36.810 --> 00:55:38.820
we would be in a
situation in which

00:55:38.820 --> 00:55:41.850
both its position
and its momentum

00:55:41.850 --> 00:55:44.790
are known with
infinite precision.

00:55:44.790 --> 00:55:46.500
And that is something
that doesn't

00:55:46.500 --> 00:55:49.020
happen in quantum mechanics.

00:55:49.020 --> 00:55:51.870
And we'll see it
in a different way.

00:55:51.870 --> 00:55:56.490
Ultimately, electrons
behave as wave.

00:55:56.490 --> 00:56:00.180
And so the ground
state of that wave

00:56:00.180 --> 00:56:02.190
is something in
which the electron

00:56:02.190 --> 00:56:05.200
can't live on the nucleus.

00:56:05.200 --> 00:56:07.320
If you want another
sort of analogy,

00:56:07.320 --> 00:56:10.110
could be one of an organ pipe.

00:56:10.110 --> 00:56:13.770
If you have an organ pipe,
there is a fundamental harmonic

00:56:13.770 --> 00:56:16.530
that you can play
and high harmonics.

00:56:16.530 --> 00:56:19.920
But there is nothing
lower in energy or sort

00:56:19.920 --> 00:56:24.000
of deeper in bass than
the fundamental harmonic.

00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:27.090
So because, basically,
electrons behave

00:56:27.090 --> 00:56:31.500
as quantum mechanical particles,
that is behave as wave,

00:56:31.500 --> 00:56:34.830
their lowest energy
meaningful state

00:56:34.830 --> 00:56:38.250
is one in which they do not
collapse to the nucleus,

00:56:38.250 --> 00:56:39.840
but they sort of
create-- and we'll

00:56:39.840 --> 00:56:44.820
see this in a moment-- sort
of an appropriate interference

00:56:44.820 --> 00:56:48.280
a stable stationary
state around the nucleus.

00:56:48.280 --> 00:56:50.520
And sort of, if you want,
this is the difference

00:56:50.520 --> 00:56:53.850
between quantum mechanics
and classical mechanics.

00:56:53.850 --> 00:56:57.690
If an electron was a
classical particle,

00:56:57.690 --> 00:56:59.730
it would collapse
on the nucleus.

00:56:59.730 --> 00:57:02.190
Because it's not, it doesn't.

00:57:02.190 --> 00:57:06.180
And you know, quantum mechanics
has been largely understanding

00:57:06.180 --> 00:57:09.120
what are these rules that
quantum object follows

00:57:09.120 --> 00:57:10.380
that are just different.

00:57:10.380 --> 00:57:12.840
And you know, sort of you'll
see some of these rules.

00:57:12.840 --> 00:57:15.420
And there are sort of different
ways in explaining this.

00:57:15.420 --> 00:57:18.660
I like to think that basically
the indetermination principle.

00:57:18.660 --> 00:57:21.930
At the end, a quantum
particle has a certain amount

00:57:21.930 --> 00:57:24.900
of indetermination that
can actually be quantified.

00:57:24.900 --> 00:57:29.340
If that quantum particle were
to collapse on the nucleus,

00:57:29.340 --> 00:57:32.820
the indetermination of the
two conjugate variables,

00:57:32.820 --> 00:57:36.480
the momentum and the
position, would actually be 0.

00:57:36.480 --> 00:57:39.010
And that can't happen.

00:57:39.010 --> 00:57:42.930
You know, as much as you start,
say, in classical mechanics,

00:57:42.930 --> 00:57:47.070
that a particle follows
Newton's equation of motion

00:57:47.070 --> 00:57:50.320
and not something different,
in quantum mechanics,

00:57:50.320 --> 00:57:53.880
you learn a set of rules that
these quantum particles follow

00:57:53.880 --> 00:57:55.590
and that have been verified.

00:57:55.590 --> 00:57:57.840
And one of these
rules basically says

00:57:57.840 --> 00:58:01.470
that the lowest energy
state for that particle

00:58:01.470 --> 00:58:05.190
is not the one in which it
collapses, but the one in which

00:58:05.190 --> 00:58:07.860
it sort of forms an
appropriate interference

00:58:07.860 --> 00:58:11.170
pattern around the nucleus,
but not collapse on it.

00:58:11.170 --> 00:58:14.970
So if you want, it's truly
quantum mechanics at its heart.

00:58:19.770 --> 00:58:23.730
And now, you see, if you
really want to sort of recover

00:58:23.730 --> 00:58:27.900
some of the subtleties
that are somehow

00:58:27.900 --> 00:58:30.490
invisible in this charge,
there's the picture.

00:58:30.490 --> 00:58:32.580
If you want sort
of to recover what

00:58:32.580 --> 00:58:37.835
are the tiny differences between
them sort of electronic levels,

00:58:37.835 --> 00:58:39.210
well, what you
could do-- this is

00:58:39.210 --> 00:58:41.580
sort of typical in a
transactional simulation.

00:58:41.580 --> 00:58:44.790
You could take a
charge the difference

00:58:44.790 --> 00:58:48.090
between a system in
which you have a methane

00:58:48.090 --> 00:58:49.800
molecule attached
to the platinum,

00:58:49.800 --> 00:58:51.900
or you don't have
a methane molecule.

00:58:51.900 --> 00:58:54.450
And there, in this
difference, you

00:58:54.450 --> 00:58:58.800
start sort of seeing patterns
of chemical bonding emerging.

00:58:58.800 --> 00:59:00.690
And so you see sort
of places where

00:59:00.690 --> 00:59:04.200
the charge density of your
system increases or decreases.

00:59:04.200 --> 00:59:06.670
And you can start
seeing here actually

00:59:06.670 --> 00:59:09.820
the d orbitals of the
platinum and the formation of

00:59:09.820 --> 00:59:12.430
and the breaking of
the chemical bonds.

00:59:12.430 --> 00:59:15.570
So there is this general
picture of atoms and spheres,

00:59:15.570 --> 00:59:19.020
but then all what we care
are those subtle effects

00:59:19.020 --> 00:59:20.980
that determine bonding.

00:59:20.980 --> 00:59:24.620
And this is actually to put
some energy numbers on it.

00:59:24.620 --> 00:59:27.330
Sort of this is
what relevant was.

00:59:27.330 --> 00:59:30.840
We live at around 300
Kelvin, sort of give or take

00:59:30.840 --> 00:59:32.610
1 order of magnitude.

00:59:32.610 --> 00:59:35.730
And the kinetic
energy of an atom

00:59:35.730 --> 00:59:39.000
in a sort of ideal
perfect gas is basically

00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:41.950
0.04 electron volts.

00:59:41.950 --> 00:59:45.000
So this is sort of
the average energy

00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:48.480
that is available
because of temperature.

00:59:48.480 --> 00:59:49.950
And so you can
understand that it's

00:59:49.950 --> 00:59:56.220
sort of that is somehow a
button limit for chemical bonds.

00:59:56.220 --> 00:59:59.580
If the chemical bonds
are, say, in our system,

00:59:59.580 --> 01:00:02.850
we're going to be
comparable or smaller

01:00:02.850 --> 01:00:05.310
than 0.04 electrons volts.

01:00:05.310 --> 01:00:09.180
We would actually evaporate
right away and disappear.

01:00:09.180 --> 01:00:15.930
So if we actually look at the
binding energy of the hydrogen

01:00:15.930 --> 01:00:20.610
bond in a dimer between
two water molecule,

01:00:20.610 --> 01:00:24.160
it's sort of roughly one
order of magnitude larger.

01:00:24.160 --> 01:00:26.010
So really water at
room temperature

01:00:26.010 --> 01:00:27.900
is sort of bound together.

01:00:27.900 --> 01:00:31.710
It's a liquid at
0.29 electrons volts.

01:00:31.710 --> 01:00:34.840
And now, you start understanding
the standard model of matter.

01:00:34.840 --> 01:00:39.300
If you think at what is the
binding energy of an electron

01:00:39.300 --> 01:00:40.300
just to a proton--

01:00:40.300 --> 01:00:42.510
this is really the
hydrogen atom--

01:00:42.510 --> 01:00:47.640
that binding energy is almost
2 orders of magnitude larger,

01:00:47.640 --> 01:00:49.830
13 electron volts.

01:00:49.830 --> 01:00:52.800
And so you can think
that, if we start

01:00:52.800 --> 01:00:55.620
going from hydrogen to
the sort of other atoms

01:00:55.620 --> 01:01:01.050
in the periodic table, the 1s
electron in the other atoms

01:01:01.050 --> 01:01:03.990
are going to be even
more tightly bound.

01:01:03.990 --> 01:01:06.930
And so they will
never be affected

01:01:06.930 --> 01:01:13.260
by sort of the average energy
present at current temperature.

01:01:13.260 --> 01:01:17.760
And actually, this number
scales as the square

01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:19.390
of the atomic number.

01:01:19.390 --> 01:01:21.210
So those core
electrons, in particular

01:01:21.210 --> 01:01:24.570
those one core electrons, are
going to be terribly bound.

01:01:24.570 --> 01:01:29.280
The only chemistry that we do
is with the highest electrons

01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:33.480
whose binding energy is sort
of comparable, basically,

01:01:33.480 --> 01:01:36.260
to this number.

01:01:36.260 --> 01:01:42.500
OK, I think we are
particularly lucky in having

01:01:42.500 --> 01:01:45.530
sort of a number of
books that are actually

01:01:45.530 --> 01:01:50.000
excellent references for
electronic structure research

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.020
nowadays.

01:01:51.020 --> 01:01:56.450
And I sort of mentioned here
three of the ones I like more.

01:01:56.450 --> 01:01:58.220
They are all very recent.

01:01:58.220 --> 01:02:03.200
There is the book from Richard
Martin at Urbana-Champaign

01:02:03.200 --> 01:02:05.720
that I would really
say it's, by now,

01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:08.690
the Bible of electronic
structure methods.

01:02:08.690 --> 01:02:12.470
It's a very complete
and very detailed book.

01:02:12.470 --> 01:02:14.090
So this is what
you would probably

01:02:14.090 --> 01:02:17.570
want to have if you were
actually to do research

01:02:17.570 --> 01:02:19.880
in electronic structure,
especially seen

01:02:19.880 --> 01:02:23.340
from the point of view of
solid-state or condensed matter

01:02:23.340 --> 01:02:25.430
and solids.

01:02:25.430 --> 01:02:28.070
Another very beautiful
book that is, I think,

01:02:28.070 --> 01:02:31.490
the closest in
spirit to this class

01:02:31.490 --> 01:02:33.740
is the book by Mike
Finnis at the University

01:02:33.740 --> 01:02:37.670
of Belfast, Interatomic
Forces in Condensed Matter.

01:02:37.670 --> 01:02:41.390
It covers both quantum
mechanical approaches,

01:02:41.390 --> 01:02:45.440
and it also shows how potential
approaches, as those described

01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:47.990
by Professor Ceder in
the previous lectures,

01:02:47.990 --> 01:02:50.270
actually emerge
very naturally from

01:02:50.270 --> 01:02:52.100
quantum mechanical methods.

01:02:52.100 --> 01:02:54.530
And we'll see a
little bit of this.

01:02:54.530 --> 01:02:59.270
And the third book is by Tim
Kaxiras at Harvard University.

01:02:59.270 --> 01:03:03.080
And again, it's an
electronic structure book

01:03:03.080 --> 01:03:08.780
with a sort of very broad
perspective on solids

01:03:08.780 --> 01:03:10.800
and condensed matter systems.

01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:14.750
So any of this is actually
a very good reference.

01:03:14.750 --> 01:03:17.030
And so what I want to do
after this introduction

01:03:17.030 --> 01:03:19.100
in the next 15
minutes is give you

01:03:19.100 --> 01:03:23.510
a refresher of quantum mechanics
in case you have never seen it.

01:03:23.510 --> 01:03:26.180
And we can also discuss
actually some reading in case

01:03:26.180 --> 01:03:27.080
you're interested.

01:03:27.080 --> 01:03:29.310
And so this is how I do it.

01:03:29.310 --> 01:03:32.090
If you go to London,
Piccadilly Circus, well, there

01:03:32.090 --> 01:03:34.220
is the Reduced
Shakespeare Company.

01:03:34.220 --> 01:03:37.460
They do in 90 minutes
all Shakespeare tragedies

01:03:37.460 --> 01:03:38.870
and all Shakespeare comedies.

01:03:38.870 --> 01:03:42.440
And so here the plan is to do
in 15 minutes all of quantum

01:03:42.440 --> 01:03:46.160
mechanics sort of to give you
the flavor of what goes on.

01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:49.790
And you see, reducing
expectation for over 20 years.

01:03:49.790 --> 01:03:51.740
I actually really like them.

01:03:51.740 --> 01:03:52.460
OK.

01:03:52.460 --> 01:03:55.940
So this really goes
to answer the question

01:03:55.940 --> 01:03:57.560
that we had before.

01:03:57.560 --> 01:03:59.720
And that's sort
of, historically,

01:03:59.720 --> 01:04:04.610
sort of between the 1900s and
sort of the mid-'20s, there was

01:04:04.610 --> 01:04:09.500
a sort of emerging experimental
consensus on a number

01:04:09.500 --> 01:04:11.580
of phenomenon.

01:04:11.580 --> 01:04:15.140
The first one was sort of
studying the properties

01:04:15.140 --> 01:04:17.030
of light in particular.

01:04:17.030 --> 01:04:19.940
Light, ultimately, is
an electromagnetic wave.

01:04:19.940 --> 01:04:22.730
And people discovered
the photoelectric effect.

01:04:22.730 --> 01:04:26.450
That's actually Albert
Einstein paper 100 years ago.

01:04:26.450 --> 01:04:30.230
This year is that the 100th
anniversary of the annus

01:04:30.230 --> 01:04:34.370
mirabilis of Albert Einstein,
in which he was basically

01:04:34.370 --> 01:04:37.630
giving an explanation of
the photoelectric effect.

01:04:37.630 --> 01:04:42.080
There are illuminating material,
something like selenium.

01:04:42.080 --> 01:04:46.340
And basically, your
electromagnetic radiation

01:04:46.340 --> 01:04:50.990
excite discretely electrons
out of the material.

01:04:50.990 --> 01:04:53.540
And that can sort
of be rationalized

01:04:53.540 --> 01:04:58.430
in terms of quanta of energy,
discrete amounts of energy,

01:04:58.430 --> 01:05:01.410
what we call photons
being exchanged.

01:05:01.410 --> 01:05:03.980
So something that people
used to think as continuum,

01:05:03.980 --> 01:05:07.730
as electromagnetic wave that can
have, say, any, in principle,

01:05:07.730 --> 01:05:11.420
wavelength is actually
sort of made up

01:05:11.420 --> 01:05:14.330
of massless particles
that have a sort

01:05:14.330 --> 01:05:16.290
of discrete amount of energy.

01:05:16.290 --> 01:05:17.850
So that was one thing.

01:05:17.850 --> 01:05:20.480
The other thing that
sort of was fairly exotic

01:05:20.480 --> 01:05:22.490
that Planck explained
and sort of, you know,

01:05:22.490 --> 01:05:24.110
that's the birth
of quantum theory,

01:05:24.110 --> 01:05:26.450
was actually looking
at the emission

01:05:26.450 --> 01:05:28.490
of an incandescent body.

01:05:28.490 --> 01:05:31.160
That's what is called
black body radiation.

01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:34.040
And the spectrum
could be explained

01:05:34.040 --> 01:05:38.690
in terms of excitation of a
gas-like of hot particles.

01:05:38.690 --> 01:05:42.110
But again, spectrum is an
electromagnetic radiation.

01:05:42.110 --> 01:05:44.960
And so there was this
sort of general idea

01:05:44.960 --> 01:05:48.770
of electromagnetic waves have
particle-like properties.

01:05:48.770 --> 01:05:51.800
What was really
sort of interesting

01:05:51.800 --> 01:05:56.420
was sort of the discovery that
particles, like electrons,

01:05:56.420 --> 01:05:58.640
can have wave-like properties.

01:05:58.640 --> 01:06:00.320
And that actually
sort of determined,

01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:04.670
ultimately, sort of the
development of wave mechanics

01:06:04.670 --> 01:06:06.980
or quantum mechanics
and, in particular,

01:06:06.980 --> 01:06:10.880
the Davisson-Germer
discovery that electron beams

01:06:10.880 --> 01:06:12.140
can be refracted.

01:06:12.140 --> 01:06:15.050
So electrons, when
you shoot electrons,

01:06:15.050 --> 01:06:17.840
they are not behaving
as classical particle.

01:06:17.840 --> 01:06:20.480
And they either sort of hit
something and bounce back,

01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:21.950
or they go through.

01:06:21.950 --> 01:06:26.048
But they actually diffract
and so behave as waves.

01:06:26.048 --> 01:06:27.590
And sort of these
were sort of if you

01:06:27.590 --> 01:06:30.260
want one of the key issues.

01:06:30.260 --> 01:06:32.750
And how do we summarize this?

01:06:32.750 --> 01:06:37.260
Well, this is actually sort
of one of fundamental ideas,

01:06:37.260 --> 01:06:40.350
so one of the ideas that
I want you to remember

01:06:40.350 --> 01:06:42.220
from quantum mechanics.

01:06:42.220 --> 01:06:44.640
This is what is called
de Broglie relation.

01:06:44.640 --> 01:06:46.500
It's from 1923.

01:06:46.500 --> 01:06:49.490
It's what I call
actually the shortest PhD

01:06:49.490 --> 01:06:51.330
thesis in the world.

01:06:51.330 --> 01:06:53.370
There are only three
letters in that.

01:06:53.370 --> 01:06:56.850
But sort of what it's
telling us is this.

01:06:56.850 --> 01:06:59.310
There is a fundamental constant.

01:06:59.310 --> 01:07:00.600
It's like gravitation.

01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:02.850
In gravitation, you have a
fundamental constant that

01:07:02.850 --> 01:07:04.920
is the attraction between mass.

01:07:04.920 --> 01:07:07.830
Well, there is another
fundamental constant

01:07:07.830 --> 01:07:10.980
that we call the
Planck constant.

01:07:10.980 --> 01:07:14.010
And here is sort of
what its value is

01:07:14.010 --> 01:07:16.170
in the international system.

01:07:16.170 --> 01:07:21.240
And this is a relation that
all particles, all objects,

01:07:21.240 --> 01:07:22.770
satisfy.

01:07:22.770 --> 01:07:28.170
And it says that, if a particle
has a certain momentum, that is

01:07:28.170 --> 01:07:31.320
has a certain mass
time velocity--

01:07:31.320 --> 01:07:34.920
OK, so if a particle
has a certain momentum,

01:07:34.920 --> 01:07:39.210
it will also display
wave-like properties.

01:07:39.210 --> 01:07:43.770
And the wavelength typical
of those wave-like properties

01:07:43.770 --> 01:07:45.670
is given by lambda.

01:07:45.670 --> 01:07:47.610
So basically, you
have an electron.

01:07:47.610 --> 01:07:49.440
You can sort of
plug in what would

01:07:49.440 --> 01:07:52.350
be an average momentum
for that electron,

01:07:52.350 --> 01:07:55.740
and you find out what
is the wavelength.

01:07:55.740 --> 01:07:59.340
What it turns out is
that, if you plug here

01:07:59.340 --> 01:08:03.840
the average momentum of a
valence electron, what you find

01:08:03.840 --> 01:08:07.740
out is that the
wavelength that it has

01:08:07.740 --> 01:08:11.490
is sort of comparable with
the interatomic distances.

01:08:11.490 --> 01:08:14.940
So electrons behave
significantly

01:08:14.940 --> 01:08:18.960
as waves at the length scale
that are relevant for you.

01:08:18.960 --> 01:08:22.649
Because if you have two atoms
that are two angstrom far apart

01:08:22.649 --> 01:08:25.710
and the electron is a
wavelength of 2 angstrom,

01:08:25.710 --> 01:08:28.410
well, then we really
need to take into account

01:08:28.410 --> 01:08:32.220
the wave-like
properties of electrons.

01:08:32.220 --> 01:08:34.410
And you see, this is
why actually nuclei

01:08:34.410 --> 01:08:37.500
we can get by just with
classical mechanics

01:08:37.500 --> 01:08:41.340
because the mass of a
proton is 2,000 times

01:08:41.340 --> 01:08:43.060
the mass of an electron.

01:08:43.060 --> 01:08:49.200
So the mass of a nucleus is
at least 2,000 times larger

01:08:49.200 --> 01:08:50.970
than the mass of an electron.

01:08:50.970 --> 01:08:55.660
And you actually have sort of
tens of protons and neutrons.

01:08:55.660 --> 01:08:59.310
So the typical
momentum is going to be

01:08:59.310 --> 01:09:03.960
thousands, tens of
thousands, larger

01:09:03.960 --> 01:09:06.060
than the momentum
of the electron.

01:09:06.060 --> 01:09:10.470
And so the typical wavelength
is going to be at least a 3

01:09:10.470 --> 01:09:14.100
or 4 orders of
magnitude smaller.

01:09:14.100 --> 01:09:18.840
And so, now, the wavelength
of a nucleus start

01:09:18.840 --> 01:09:22.859
to be 10 to the minus 14,
10 to the minus 15 meters,

01:09:22.859 --> 01:09:29.229
is not relevant anymore for the
distance between the nuclei.

01:09:29.229 --> 01:09:33.689
So for all practical purposes,
the wavelength of nuclei

01:09:33.689 --> 01:09:36.149
is so small that
we can treat nuclei

01:09:36.149 --> 01:09:38.250
as a point-like particles.

01:09:38.250 --> 01:09:41.560
But the wave of electrons is
comparable to the distance,

01:09:41.560 --> 01:09:45.270
and so we need to describe
electrons as waves.

01:09:45.270 --> 01:09:49.319
And this relation is actually
very simple to sort of look

01:09:49.319 --> 01:09:51.319
at in practical terms.

01:09:51.319 --> 01:09:55.080
Instead of using the
international system of meters

01:09:55.080 --> 01:09:57.240
and seconds and
so on, we actually

01:09:57.240 --> 01:10:00.120
use a different system
of unit of measure.

01:10:00.120 --> 01:10:02.490
That is what we
call atomic units.

01:10:02.490 --> 01:10:06.570
Of course, no one forces
us to use the meter

01:10:06.570 --> 01:10:07.800
as a unit of measure.

01:10:07.800 --> 01:10:11.580
That was actually a byproduct
of the French Revolution.

01:10:11.580 --> 01:10:18.240
So sort of a lot of people in
the general arena of chemistry

01:10:18.240 --> 01:10:21.690
and solid state use different
sets of units of measure.

01:10:21.690 --> 01:10:24.600
One of the most
difficult is atomic units

01:10:24.600 --> 01:10:30.300
where the unit of length is
actually the typical radius

01:10:30.300 --> 01:10:32.290
of 1 hydrogen atom.

01:10:32.290 --> 01:10:36.480
So the sort of standard
measure gives us

01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:43.080
0.53 angstrom or what is
called 1 Bohr for the radius

01:10:43.080 --> 01:10:46.240
of an hydrogen atom.

01:10:46.240 --> 01:10:49.350
And so this will
be an atomic unit.

01:10:49.350 --> 01:10:55.200
So 1 angstrom is
roughly 2 atomic units.

01:10:55.200 --> 01:10:57.330
In this scheme,
atomic unit system,

01:10:57.330 --> 01:11:03.950
the Planck constant is
actually going to be 2 pi.

01:11:03.950 --> 01:11:06.800
6.28, that's what
it turns out to be

01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:09.140
when we sort of choose
appropriately all

01:11:09.140 --> 01:11:11.240
the atomic units of measure.

01:11:11.240 --> 01:11:17.090
And again, the atomic
unit of momentum, one

01:11:17.090 --> 01:11:20.900
is going to be the
mass of an electron

01:11:20.900 --> 01:11:26.900
times the velocity of
a 1s electron, again,

01:11:26.900 --> 01:11:28.500
in a hydrogen atom.

01:11:28.500 --> 01:11:31.910
So you see the electron
in the hydrogen atom

01:11:31.910 --> 01:11:35.420
basically satisfy
perfectly Planck relation.

01:11:35.420 --> 01:11:40.910
Because in atomic units, it's
momentum p is equal to 1.

01:11:40.910 --> 01:11:45.440
And h, the Planck
constant, is equal to 2 pi.

01:11:45.440 --> 01:11:50.220
So its wavelength is
going to be equal to 2 pi.

01:11:50.220 --> 01:11:54.440
And if you think at the atom
as having a radius of 1,

01:11:54.440 --> 01:11:57.140
you understand that
the wavelength of 2 pi

01:11:57.140 --> 01:11:59.660
is the right
wavelength to basically

01:11:59.660 --> 01:12:05.780
have along the diameter
1 single oscillation.

01:12:05.780 --> 01:12:09.170
And so we sort of start
thinking at this ground

01:12:09.170 --> 01:12:11.420
state of the
electron that doesn't

01:12:11.420 --> 01:12:17.390
fall on the nucleus as
the fundamental harmonics

01:12:17.390 --> 01:12:21.050
for this wave in the
presence of a potential.

01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:25.370
OK.

01:12:25.370 --> 01:12:30.170
There are cases in which the
quantum mechanical nature

01:12:30.170 --> 01:12:34.280
of the nuclei actually
becomes relevant.

01:12:34.280 --> 01:12:38.750
There is much less
modeling activity on that

01:12:38.750 --> 01:12:43.100
because it's just fairly
computationally expensive.

01:12:43.100 --> 01:12:46.010
One of the cases in
which it's important

01:12:46.010 --> 01:12:49.550
is when you have a
very light nuclei.

01:12:49.550 --> 01:12:52.670
So if you have a system
that has a lot of hydrogen,

01:12:52.670 --> 01:12:56.030
well, it actually
might become relevant.

01:12:56.030 --> 01:12:59.720
And the fact that your proton
has its own wavelength,

01:12:59.720 --> 01:13:02.300
has its own delocalization,
could actually

01:13:02.300 --> 01:13:03.980
become important.

01:13:03.980 --> 01:13:08.330
And it's never going
to change dramatically

01:13:08.330 --> 01:13:10.520
the physics of the
chemistry of your system,

01:13:10.520 --> 01:13:13.160
but it's going to
introduce relevant effects.

01:13:13.160 --> 01:13:15.980
And you know, this
is actually coming

01:13:15.980 --> 01:13:20.420
from a Nature paper from 1999, a
very, very expensive simulation

01:13:20.420 --> 01:13:23.130
in which both the electronics
degrees of freedom

01:13:23.130 --> 01:13:23.990
were studied.

01:13:23.990 --> 01:13:27.650
And also, the quantum
delocalization effects

01:13:27.650 --> 01:13:30.470
on the proton were
studied, basically,

01:13:30.470 --> 01:13:34.050
for what is called a
hydrated proton in water.

01:13:34.050 --> 01:13:37.550
So if you have water and
you add a proton, well,

01:13:37.550 --> 01:13:43.160
the first thing that will
form is a hydronium ion, H3O+.

01:13:43.160 --> 01:13:46.130
And for 20, 30 years,
people had actually

01:13:46.130 --> 01:13:51.650
discussed what was the general
coordination of this proton.

01:13:51.650 --> 01:13:55.490
There was sort of a hypothesis
in which people were discussing

01:13:55.490 --> 01:13:58.340
about an Eigen
compound, from Eigen,

01:13:58.340 --> 01:14:00.200
the person that
first suggested it,

01:14:00.200 --> 01:14:05.210
a proton bound to two water
molecules basically creating

01:14:05.210 --> 01:14:09.140
an H5O 2+ system.

01:14:09.140 --> 01:14:11.990
And then there was the Zundel
hypothesis in which this

01:14:11.990 --> 01:14:16.790
hydronium ion, H3O+, was
surrounded by three water

01:14:16.790 --> 01:14:17.930
molecules.

01:14:17.930 --> 01:14:20.450
And you know-- nothing
better than doing an accurate

01:14:20.450 --> 01:14:22.670
simulation to find it out.

01:14:22.670 --> 01:14:26.060
And being finally a quantum
mechanical simulation,

01:14:26.060 --> 01:14:28.190
the result was
that it's actually

01:14:28.190 --> 01:14:31.280
the proton is in what is
called a functional state.

01:14:31.280 --> 01:14:35.780
Sort of it stays half of the
time in an Eigen state, that

01:14:35.780 --> 01:14:39.110
is a state predicted
by Eigen, and half

01:14:39.110 --> 01:14:41.000
of the time in a Zundel state.

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:42.710
And you see this is
actually interesting,

01:14:42.710 --> 01:14:46.160
sort of comparing the
quantum mechanical prediction

01:14:46.160 --> 01:14:48.110
and the classical prediction.

01:14:48.110 --> 01:14:51.980
That is for a classical proton
in a quantum mechanical field

01:14:51.980 --> 01:14:52.880
of electrons.

01:14:52.880 --> 01:14:55.760
And you see the sort
of average position

01:14:55.760 --> 01:14:57.890
in the proton
between two molecules

01:14:57.890 --> 01:15:01.760
are sort of more
delocalized, more spread out,

01:15:01.760 --> 01:15:03.940
than in the classical case.

01:15:03.940 --> 01:15:07.250
So that is, I think,
the structure of water

01:15:07.250 --> 01:15:09.150
is interesting.

01:15:09.150 --> 01:15:11.810
There are sort of
other cases in which

01:15:11.810 --> 01:15:17.990
you have a very shallow energy
barrier between two states

01:15:17.990 --> 01:15:21.770
in which the quantum
delocalization and the quantum

01:15:21.770 --> 01:15:24.170
tunneling could be important.

01:15:24.170 --> 01:15:27.750
And something like that happened
actually in strontium titanite.

01:15:27.750 --> 01:15:33.110
That is a perovskite very
similar to the lead titanite

01:15:33.110 --> 01:15:35.480
that we have seen
in the first slide.

01:15:35.480 --> 01:15:39.590
And we remember there were
two phases, a cubic phase

01:15:39.590 --> 01:15:42.380
and a distorted
ferroelectric phase.

01:15:42.380 --> 01:15:45.710
Well, it turns out that in the
case of strontium titanite,

01:15:45.710 --> 01:15:48.350
the energy barrier
between those two phases

01:15:48.350 --> 01:15:52.130
is so shallow that
all the ions actually

01:15:52.130 --> 01:15:56.840
tunnel back and forth between
all the possible structure.

01:15:56.840 --> 01:16:00.080
And so a system that
would be ferroelectric

01:16:00.080 --> 01:16:04.100
in a classical simulation of
the ions, when we actually

01:16:04.100 --> 01:16:08.690
introduce a quantum mechanical
effect for the nucleus as well,

01:16:08.690 --> 01:16:11.240
it turns out to be the
state that keeps tunneling

01:16:11.240 --> 01:16:13.230
between all the possibilities.

01:16:13.230 --> 01:16:17.030
And so it doesn't
display ferroelectricity.

01:16:17.030 --> 01:16:19.670
The last case that is
probably the most relevant--

01:16:19.670 --> 01:16:21.240
and we'll see that
in more detail,

01:16:21.240 --> 01:16:22.760
so I haven't presented here--

01:16:22.760 --> 01:16:25.370
in which we really need
to take into account

01:16:25.370 --> 01:16:28.460
the quantum mechanical
nature of the ions

01:16:28.460 --> 01:16:31.790
has to do with
structural excitation.

01:16:31.790 --> 01:16:35.240
When you put temperature, say,
in something like a solid,

01:16:35.240 --> 01:16:40.910
you don't excite vibrational
states in a continuum way.

01:16:40.910 --> 01:16:45.380
But you actually excite
discrete vibrational states

01:16:45.380 --> 01:16:46.610
of your system.

01:16:46.610 --> 01:16:49.520
And this is sort of
fundamental to understand

01:16:49.520 --> 01:16:54.260
many thermodynamical properties
of solid, of molecules,

01:16:54.260 --> 01:16:57.320
something like the
specific heat of a solid.

01:16:57.320 --> 01:17:01.010
But we'll see examples
of that later on.

01:17:01.010 --> 01:17:04.100
And those are cases
in which we actually

01:17:04.100 --> 01:17:07.640
know very well on how to deal
with this specific problem

01:17:07.640 --> 01:17:11.810
of the quantization of
the vibrational excitation

01:17:11.810 --> 01:17:14.090
of your system.

01:17:14.090 --> 01:17:14.690
OK.

01:17:14.690 --> 01:17:17.840
So with all of this, the
first thing to remember

01:17:17.840 --> 01:17:23.400
is that electrons
actually behave as waves.

01:17:23.400 --> 01:17:26.390
So in reality, what
is quantum mechanics?

01:17:26.390 --> 01:17:29.180
It's nothing else
than the mechanics

01:17:29.180 --> 01:17:30.980
of electrons as waves.

01:17:30.980 --> 01:17:33.020
So we don't consider
it a mechanics

01:17:33.020 --> 01:17:35.900
of classical particle,
but it's the mechanics

01:17:35.900 --> 01:17:38.330
of wave-like objects.

01:17:38.330 --> 01:17:41.960
And there are going to be very
specific laws if you want them.

01:17:41.960 --> 01:17:44.330
There's going to be the
Schrodinger equation that

01:17:44.330 --> 01:17:48.330
is the Newton equivalent
of the equation of motion.

01:17:48.330 --> 01:17:49.820
But there are also
going to be very

01:17:49.820 --> 01:17:52.850
specific computational
constraints

01:17:52.850 --> 01:17:54.920
on how we describe a wave.

01:17:54.920 --> 01:17:55.610
OK.

01:17:55.610 --> 01:17:57.050
What you are very
familiar is sort

01:17:57.050 --> 01:17:58.570
of the mechanics of a particle.

01:17:58.570 --> 01:18:00.110
So in the mechanics
of a particle,

01:18:00.110 --> 01:18:02.150
you have Newton
equation of motion.

01:18:02.150 --> 01:18:05.570
You have mass times acceleration
is equal to the force.

01:18:05.570 --> 01:18:08.720
That's an ordinary second-order
differential equation.

01:18:08.720 --> 01:18:11.900
That basically
means that what you

01:18:11.900 --> 01:18:16.490
are going to obtain
by integrating

01:18:16.490 --> 01:18:19.010
this equation of
motion is actually

01:18:19.010 --> 01:18:21.860
the trajectory as
a function of time

01:18:21.860 --> 01:18:24.290
and the first derivative
that is the velocity.

01:18:24.290 --> 01:18:28.430
And because its second-order
differential equation,

01:18:28.430 --> 01:18:30.800
what you really need
to define that is, say,

01:18:30.800 --> 01:18:32.480
something like the
initial condition.

01:18:32.480 --> 01:18:35.030
You need to define
where your particle is

01:18:35.030 --> 01:18:38.360
at a certain instant and
what is its velocity.

01:18:38.360 --> 01:18:40.820
And once you know that
and you know, say,

01:18:40.820 --> 01:18:45.380
what is the force, something
like the gravitational force

01:18:45.380 --> 01:18:50.040
in this case, well, you are able
to integrate your trajectory.

01:18:50.040 --> 01:18:50.630
OK.

01:18:50.630 --> 01:18:53.760
So this is sort of integration
of the equation of motion.

01:18:53.760 --> 01:18:58.550
But what is really important
is that your dynamical system

01:18:58.550 --> 01:19:03.600
that is your particle moving
around is perfectly described.

01:19:03.600 --> 01:19:06.530
So we know everything
about that particle.

01:19:06.530 --> 01:19:11.180
If I have every instant in
time, I give you two vectors,

01:19:11.180 --> 01:19:11.720
basically.

01:19:11.720 --> 01:19:15.530
I give the position,
and I give the velocity.

01:19:15.530 --> 01:19:20.160
And in a sort of three
dimension, that's six numbers.

01:19:20.160 --> 01:19:20.750
OK.

01:19:20.750 --> 01:19:22.310
So it's very easy to remember.

01:19:22.310 --> 01:19:25.340
And it's very easy to
store in a computer.

01:19:25.340 --> 01:19:28.490
And this is my last
slide for today.

01:19:28.490 --> 01:19:32.750
The amazing
computational complexity

01:19:32.750 --> 01:19:37.190
that we have when we actually
need to describe a wave

01:19:37.190 --> 01:19:40.920
is that to describe a
wave that is basically

01:19:40.920 --> 01:19:47.240
a delocalized excitation a
wave is an amplitude everywhere

01:19:47.240 --> 01:19:48.390
in space.

01:19:48.390 --> 01:19:53.630
So even to describe a single
electron, what we need to say

01:19:53.630 --> 01:19:59.240
is that at every instant what
is the amplitude of that wave

01:19:59.240 --> 01:20:01.890
everywhere in space.

01:20:01.890 --> 01:20:05.570
And so you see we have gone
from a classical particle that

01:20:05.570 --> 01:20:09.050
was basically six
numbers at every instant

01:20:09.050 --> 01:20:13.490
to a quantum mechanical
particle that at every instant,

01:20:13.490 --> 01:20:18.150
in principle, requires a field
that covers all the space.

01:20:18.150 --> 01:20:22.970
So we need to specify the
amplitude everywhere in space.

01:20:22.970 --> 01:20:26.960
And this becomes worse
and worse as the number

01:20:26.960 --> 01:20:29.810
of particle increases.

01:20:29.810 --> 01:20:32.270
Suppose that we
had two electrons.

01:20:32.270 --> 01:20:34.580
Well, what we need
to give is now

01:20:34.580 --> 01:20:38.030
an amplitude at a
certain instant of time

01:20:38.030 --> 01:20:44.120
that would be a function of one
vector r and another vector r2.

01:20:44.120 --> 01:20:48.110
So if, by any chance,
you were satisfied

01:20:48.110 --> 01:20:52.700
by sort of describing this
in a discretized form--

01:20:52.700 --> 01:20:56.180
you see sort of discretizing
space and giving the amplitude

01:20:56.180 --> 01:20:57.620
at every point in space.

01:20:57.620 --> 01:20:59.990
And say to describe
an electron, you

01:20:59.990 --> 01:21:04.310
could be happy by just
giving, say, a million points.

01:21:04.310 --> 01:21:07.110
Well, if you want to
describe two electrons,

01:21:07.110 --> 01:21:09.860
you have to give 1 million
times 1 million points.

01:21:09.860 --> 01:21:12.380
And three electrons--
1 million to the cube

01:21:12.380 --> 01:21:13.980
and so on and so forth.

01:21:13.980 --> 01:21:17.630
So just the computational
complexity of this object

01:21:17.630 --> 01:21:18.860
explodes.

01:21:18.860 --> 01:21:22.340
That is ultimately
why it is so difficult

01:21:22.340 --> 01:21:26.960
to solve the equivalent of the
Newton's equation of motion

01:21:26.960 --> 01:21:30.420
for a quantum particle that
is the Schrodinger equation.

01:21:30.420 --> 01:21:33.680
And so with this, I'll conclude
that, if you need any reading

01:21:33.680 --> 01:21:35.690
on sort of fundamental
quantum mechanics,

01:21:35.690 --> 01:21:37.280
I can give you a suggestion.

01:21:37.280 --> 01:21:40.220
In general, sort of
physical chemistry textbooks

01:21:40.220 --> 01:21:41.600
do a very good job.

01:21:41.600 --> 01:21:43.280
There is a quantum
mechanical book

01:21:43.280 --> 01:21:45.950
that is called the Bransden
and Joachain Quantum

01:21:45.950 --> 01:21:48.110
Mechanics that is very good.

01:21:48.110 --> 01:21:50.870
But what you need
for this class you'll

01:21:50.870 --> 01:21:52.880
sort of see in the
next few slides

01:21:52.880 --> 01:21:54.950
and in the beginning
of next lecture.

01:21:54.950 --> 01:21:57.710
And then really we'll
sort of start describing

01:21:57.710 --> 01:21:59.140
electronic structure methods.

01:21:59.140 --> 01:22:01.880
That is, how do we deal
with this complexity?

01:22:01.880 --> 01:22:04.830
And how do we apply it
to practical system?

01:22:04.830 --> 01:22:07.830
And so with this
appointment on Thursday--

01:22:07.830 --> 01:22:11.120
same time, but in room 1115.

01:22:11.120 --> 01:22:15.190
And then we meet again for
class here next Tuesday.

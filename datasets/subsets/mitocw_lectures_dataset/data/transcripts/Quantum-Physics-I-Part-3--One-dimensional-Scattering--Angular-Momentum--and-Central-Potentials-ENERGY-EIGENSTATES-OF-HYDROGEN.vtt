00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:04.170
PROFESSOR: Solutions
can be organized.

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.580
One way to do it, it's
not the standard way,

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:12.450
is with plotting
n here and l here,

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:22.290
and you have 0,
1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3.

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:24.550
You have all this points.

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:26.715
Remember, every
point this allowed.

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:32.820
Every integer
combination is allowed.

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.920
All those are energy levels
of the hydrogen atom,

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:44.010
but now you can see that
this point, when both are 0,

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.950
corresponds to n equal to 1.

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.700
Because if n and l are
0, n is equal to 1,

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.150
and there's just one
solution with n equal to 1.

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:59.675
These two points here,
when l is equal to 1

00:00:59.675 --> 00:01:03.590
and n equals 0, with n is
equal 1 and l equals 0,

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:08.690
represent the two possibilities
that realize n equals to 2.

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:16.040
n equals to 2 is realized by
having 1 and 0 or 1 and 0, two

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.220
values.

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.130
Similarly, there
are three things

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.330
with n equal to 3, four things--

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.410
my graph is not that
great-- with n equal to 4,

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:29.000
and more and more states.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:43.679
So for each n you have that n
plus l is equal to n minus 1.

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.930
And l can never
exceed n minus 1,

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.115
and that's physically quite
something that people remember.

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:11.920
But also n cannot exceed n
minus 1 or 0, both are there,

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.810
limited by these quantities.

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:26.540
So if you have some n, you
will have l and n, for example,

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.240
for some quantum number n.

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:35.380
You will have l equals 0
and n would be n minus 1.

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.720
That would work out.

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:44.980
l plus n would be n minus
1, or 1 and n minus 2,

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:50.170
or all the things up
to n minus 1 and 0.

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.000
So they take turns.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.350
They have to add
up to n minus 1.

00:03:01.826 --> 00:03:04.540
So let's plot.

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.400
Let's actually, we can go here.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.280
We don't have too much
more to say at this moment.

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.840
So let's have this.

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:24.180
We can do a little counting
that is interesting,

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.095
and I'll count the number
of states for a given n.

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:43.430
So for example, for n equals
to 1, what can we have?

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:53.510
We said, l equals 0, and
capital N is equal to 0 as well,

00:03:53.510 --> 00:04:02.170
and that's one state
for n equals 2.

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:03.420
What can you have?

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:09.140
n equals to 2, you could have
l equals 1, or l equals 0.

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:12.470
So l equals 1, or l equals 0.

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:15.450
And how many states
do we have here?

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:21.079
Well, l equals 1 can have
m equals 1, 0, and minus 1.

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:25.250
Remember, the m values is
another label for states.

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:27.380
Those are different states.

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:33.696
So here, there are 3 states,
plus 1 state, 3 plus 1 states,

00:04:33.696 --> 00:04:36.120
that's 4.

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:41.760
n equals 3 will have l
equals 2, l equals 1,

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:46.860
and l equals 0, which
is 5 states plus 3

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:55.440
states plus 1 state, which is
9 states, and that's 3 squared.

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:02.010
And 4 was actually 2 squared,
and if you go on to n

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:05.640
you will have n square states.

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:09.060
Something that perhaps
you could try to count,

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:10.650
and show that that's true.

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:25.160
So what are our quantum numbers
for the states of hydrogen?

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:29.180
Well, our quantum numbers
are, it's our choice,

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:31.940
but physically we
want to understand

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:34.200
them each intuitively.

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.160
So here we go.

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:40.150
One most important quantum
number, and its name says so,

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:42.280
is principle quantum number.

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:54.490
So the quantum
numbers of hydrogen,

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:57.190
and the first
important thing is n.

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:59.300
We definitely cannot
do away with n.

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:02.720
It fixes our energies.

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:06.890
And now we have a possibility.

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:09.860
We look at this and we
say, yeah well, I actually

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:16.580
I either need to determine
what is l or what is n.

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:20.240
So it doesn't even come close.

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:24.740
Physicists will not say, oh,
I want to describe the quantum

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:29.070
number by the degree of the
polynomial inside the solution.

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:33.320
No, physicists will say, I want
to use the angular momentum.

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:37.190
And certainly, if you
know l, and you know n,

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:39.380
you know capital N.

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:42.350
So capital N is a funny number.

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:49.020
It has to do with the degree
of the polynomial that shows up

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:55.130
in between this leading behavior
and that exponential behavior,

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:59.415
very interesting, but
not directly physical.

00:06:59.415 --> 00:07:03.590
The l, however, is
directly associated

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:06.090
to an observable
angular momentum.

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:09.740
So to describe the
state that I have here,

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:12.860
if I give you n and l,
you can see that you

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:14.540
determine which state you are.

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:20.720
So the second quantum
number is going to be l,

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:23.600
and the third quantum
number is unavoidable.

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:27.920
It's the z component of
angular momentum, should be m.

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:29.420
That's also physical.

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:33.860
We should not skip it.

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:36.200
So these are our
quantum numbers,

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:43.460
and they fix capital N,
in case you're interested,

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:53.580
as n minus l plus 1, and
that's interesting information.

00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:58.150
So let's recall our variables.

00:07:58.150 --> 00:07:59.630
OK, a rho is here.

00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:02.210
That's very nice.

00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:17.780
So rho is 2 kappa
z over a naught r,

00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:20.180
but now we know what kappa is.

00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:21.870
Kappa is 1 over 2n.

00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:29.020
So actually, the rho
variable is tailored

00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:30.670
to the quantum numbers.

00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:37.770
It's just Zr over n a naught,
where n is the principle

00:08:37.770 --> 00:08:38.549
quantum number.

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:43.190
So back to the solution.

00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:47.730
You see, we have
to recap quickly.

00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:58.450
Psi nlm is equal to U of the
energy of the radial equation--

00:08:58.450 --> 00:09:05.200
so n and l is sufficient
for that-- over r Ylm.

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:10.700
Or the U is the thing
that we had here, Ul,

00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:14.030
and now it has an
energy into it.

00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:21.000
So it's a rho to the l plus 1,
still r and rho up to numbers.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.930
So this is like.

00:09:23.930 --> 00:09:32.660
A rho, a Wnl if we wish,
of rho e to the minus rho,

00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:36.460
and Ylm theta phi.

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:56.390
Well, let's write one more
equation, and then finish.

00:09:56.390 --> 00:10:02.660
So just to give the
feeling of this solution,

00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:06.380
what does that give you?

00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:14.140
Rho to the l, a
polynomial of rho,

00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:18.180
which is a polynomial
of degree n.

00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:29.251
n, which is little n minus l
plus 1 times e to the minus rho

00:10:29.251 --> 00:10:29.750
Ylm.

00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:36.050
It's important for you to
see the whole solution.

00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:39.650
This is the whole solution
of the hydrogen atom.

00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:42.240
I'll write it in one more way.

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:46.270
A, a constant, because
this is similar.

00:10:46.270 --> 00:10:52.120
Rho, well, rho is, in
terms of units, at least

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:58.100
has r over a naught to the l.

00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:09.290
Here it is a polynomial in
r over a naught of degree.

00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:14.120
Little n minus l plus
1, and this polynomial,

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:16.230
we could make a
whole study of it.

00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:19.270
These are Laguerre polynomials.

00:11:19.270 --> 00:11:23.060
We will not look into
them in this course.

00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:26.630
You may do it in a
more advanced course.

00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:30.230
It's interesting, but it's
better to just get an intuition

00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:32.010
as to what's happening here.

00:11:32.010 --> 00:11:34.130
There is an e to
the minus rho, which

00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:36.260
is interesting to have fully.

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:44.520
So this is e to the
minus Zr over n a naught,

00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:49.213
and there's a Ylm
of theta and phi.

00:11:52.530 --> 00:11:59.160
So this is your whole solution
for the hydrogen atom.

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:04.650
We should write the simplest
one psi 1, 0, 0, n equals 1, l

00:12:04.650 --> 00:12:08.790
equals 0, m equals 0,
spherically symmetric.

00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:16.170
Here it is, 1 over pi a cube,
e to the minus r over a naught

00:12:16.170 --> 00:12:18.540
For the KZ is equal to 1.

00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:24.350
Ground state of hydrogen.

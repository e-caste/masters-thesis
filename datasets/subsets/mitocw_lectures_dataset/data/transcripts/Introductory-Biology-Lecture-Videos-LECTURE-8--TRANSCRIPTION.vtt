00:00:16.812 --> 00:00:18.520
BARBARA IMPERIALI:
OK, we'll get started.

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.020
I've got everything
turned on here.

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:22.330
So, a couple of things.

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:26.620
I've been mentioning that
it's really kind of cool,

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:28.810
I think, at this
stage, where you've

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.030
gathered enough steam
in some of the topics

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:33.340
that many things that
come out in the news

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.490
might start looking of
interest or relevant to you.

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:38.470
And I found this.

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:41.230
It had a news brief
in The Scientist,

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.150
and then I went to the
original paper, which

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:45.340
is in Nature Biotechnology.

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:49.660
And if you recall, towards the
end of the work on proteins,

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.550
we were talking about
phenylketonuria,

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.500
which is a genetically
linked disorder,

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.400
where people cannot metabolize
phenylalanine to keep

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.530
the levels of fell
phenylalanine in check.

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.459
So what happens is
the phenylalanine

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:08.350
gets converted to
a toxic material,

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.560
and it causes a lot of
fundamental physiologic

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:17.150
disorders that are a lot
of neurologic disorders.

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.948
So what a small company
in the area called--

00:01:20.948 --> 00:01:22.240
what's the name of the company?

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:23.050
I can see it here.

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:24.610
Anyway.

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.900
Synlogic is a synthetic
biology company,

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.710
which basically engineers
bacterial strains

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.010
as probiotics that can
be used to mitigate

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:37.870
some genetic disorders.

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:41.050
And so they've created
a bacterial strain that

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:43.990
can metabolize
phenylalanine, so did

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.470
a good job of sort of not
letting your phenylalanine

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:48.760
levels get too high.

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:53.980
So in the GI system,
this bacterium basically

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:56.950
works on phenylalanine
to metabolize it

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.500
so that, then, people
don't have to lead

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:05.980
such a strict dietary regime
and have way less risk.

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:07.480
So I think it's a
really cool thing.

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:12.400
This probiotic is in
one, two clinical trials.

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.080
It's being fast tracked.

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.290
And the company, in general,
is a synthetic biology company

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:22.840
working on solutions to
certain types of diseases

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.070
that could either save you from
having a lot of restrictions

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:29.890
on your lifestyle or,
alternatively, save you

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:31.840
from taking
medications and stuff.

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.320
So that's something
that caught my eye.

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:38.440
I want to remind you
that I have now put

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.310
the link to The Scientist in
the sidebar of the website

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.740
so it's much easier for
you to grab it and take

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.330
a look at what's in the news.

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:48.555
There's stuff in the news
every two or three days.

00:02:48.555 --> 00:02:49.930
And there are
things that I think

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.860
you'll find interesting that
really relate to technology,

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.170
engineering, and
fundamental science

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.360
that are related to biology.

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.360
The other thing I want
to do is remind you

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.910
that towards the
end of the class--

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.190
but no time like the
present, because it

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.410
is sort of the equivalent
of one of the problem sets

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:12.610
but, in fact, worth a little
bit more than the problem set.

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:17.740
I want to encourage you to keep
an eye on The Scientist link

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:20.770
and maybe pick out a topic
that two or three of you

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:24.730
would like to write a news brief
on with a paragraph of writing

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.310
on introduction and
what the technology is,

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.270
how technology has addressed
a particular scientific or

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:33.370
biological problem.

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:36.820
And then there should also be
a graphic that describes it.

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.910
Not stuff snipped out of
whatever you're reading.

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:43.120
Something that you create
as a team to sort of

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.220
describe a concept to people.

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:49.030
There's alternatives
with that assignment.

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.700
You can also pick an interesting
protein from the PDB,

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.480
make a 3D print of it,
learn how to print it,

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.960
and go to the 3D printers
in the maker labs,

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:01.030
and print the protein,
and then write

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:02.870
a brief summary of what it is.

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:06.550
And one other idea I had
for the engineers' view

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:10.460
is I would love a
better, less clunky

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:13.960
topoisomerase demonstration.

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:15.610
In particular, I'd
really like one

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:18.550
where you can snip
the pieces apart, let

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:21.170
the untangling happen, and
put them back together.

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:24.400
So some of you could work
with a couple of colleagues

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.980
and make something,
which I know a lot of you

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:31.450
are really keen on, which
is why you're engineers.

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:34.390
OK, any questions
about any of this?

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:38.080
I'm trying to make sure that
this doesn't creep up on you.

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.120
It's just something you do.

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:46.120
It's great to get awareness of
technology in the life sciences

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.760
because of how much
contribution it makes.

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:50.740
So if you keep an
eye on things, you

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.920
won't be forced to suddenly
find something good

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:54.790
at the last minute.

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:56.650
You'll just have found
something and go,

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:59.080
that's the perfect
thing to describe.

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:00.130
All right?

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:02.300
Questions?

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:05.100
And the other thing
is if you're unsure,

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:08.970
you can always let us
know what you have chosen

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:12.030
or what you think you're going
to choose in the chat with us,

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:15.240
and we'll say, yeah,
looks like a good idea.

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.490
OK, so let's move forward now.

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:21.310
All right, so what I
want to do, first of all,

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:25.510
is just remind you-- it kind
of flew by a little bit--

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:28.954
that DNA replication
is bidirectional.

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:38.570
So what that means
is wherever you

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:40.910
have an origin of
replication, you can

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:43.250
replicate in two directions.

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:46.160
And I was sort of falling
asleep thinking about this.

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.380
I sure wonder what
happens at the other side

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:51.980
of the circular plasmid when
the machineries kind of collide

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:54.290
and you spit out
a brand-new copy

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:56.240
of a circular chunk of DNA.

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:59.455
But don't think
about that too much.

00:05:59.455 --> 00:06:01.080
It'll probably keep
you awake too much.

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:02.600
So this is circular DNA.

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:06.603
So what organisms
have circular DNA?

00:06:06.603 --> 00:06:07.520
AUDIENCE: Prokaryotes.

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:08.812
BARBARA IMPERIALI: Prokaryotes.

00:06:08.812 --> 00:06:11.135
Remember, the eukaryotic
DNA is linear.

00:06:11.135 --> 00:06:12.510
And actually,
we're going to talk

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:16.170
about a conundrum with
the eukaryotic DNA because

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:19.780
of the ends of the DNA,
the ends of the chromosomes

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:22.650
and their copying, when
we talk about telomerase.

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:25.590
But this is typical of a
bacterial circular DNA.

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:29.250
It's usually super coiled
and becomes uncoiled in order

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:30.600
to be replicated.

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:33.030
So, obviously, going
bidirectionally

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:35.490
gives you twice the speed,
because your roaring

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:37.350
around the same time.

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:40.530
The helicase opens up the DNA.

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:42.720
DNA polymerase does its job.

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:48.340
The pink strand here would
be the leading strand.

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:53.170
And there's obviously going to
be one on both strands of DNA,

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:55.067
which will replicate very well.

00:06:55.067 --> 00:06:56.650
But don't forget,
you're going to have

00:06:56.650 --> 00:07:00.620
to deal with the lagging
strands in both cases.

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:09.330
So in both cases,
what you would do

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:13.500
is stick down a
primer in order to be

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:16.110
able to build those
lagging strands.

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:18.930
Otherwise, DNA polymerase
can't get a grip

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:21.360
on the double-stranded
DNA in order

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:23.220
to carry out the synthesis.

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:26.730
So in those cases,
there would be a primer

00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:30.390
to set up the lagging strand,
and then DNA synthesis

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:31.720
can occur.

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:32.910
So let's put that in.

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:47.280
Once there's a primer here,
DNA synthesis can occur.

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:50.330
And then what happens
with respect to the pieces

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:51.680
that we're dealing with?

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:55.380
What happens with the primer?

00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:59.070
What do we have to do to get to
a nice complete, intact strand

00:07:59.070 --> 00:07:59.910
of DNA?

00:07:59.910 --> 00:08:02.620
Which enzymes are involved?

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:03.314
Yeah?

00:08:03.314 --> 00:08:04.022
AUDIENCE: Ligase.

00:08:06.617 --> 00:08:08.950
BARBARA IMPERIALI: Here, there
would be ligase activity.

00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:09.803
We need that.

00:08:09.803 --> 00:08:10.970
What about at the other end?

00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:13.300
What do we do with the
primer, and then how

00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:15.600
can we move forward?

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:17.620
Someone else?

00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:19.090
What happens with the primer?

00:08:19.090 --> 00:08:21.220
It's oftentimes an RNA primer.

00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:24.490
You'll see in a moment that
RNA doesn't need a primase,

00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:27.250
so it's very easy
for RNA polymerase

00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:28.690
to stitch in little pieces.

00:08:28.690 --> 00:08:34.929
What do we have to do, though,
to get an intact strand of DNA?

00:08:34.929 --> 00:08:35.634
OK.

00:08:35.634 --> 00:08:37.451
AUDIENCE: Have to
remove the [? RNA. ?]

00:08:37.451 --> 00:08:38.409
BARBARA IMPERIALI: Yup.

00:08:38.409 --> 00:08:41.200
So you're going
to remove the RNA.

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:44.830
Then the polymerase, later
on, when we keep going,

00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:46.990
can sort of build this piece.

00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:49.630
And then we'll have to
ligate that, as well.

00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:54.490
So you want to remember all the
functions of those enzymes that

00:08:54.490 --> 00:08:56.570
are involved in replication.

00:08:56.570 --> 00:08:58.510
It's a little
worrisome that people--

00:08:58.510 --> 00:09:00.220
I know you don't
want to talk or you

00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:02.860
think that's an obvious answer,
but it's really important

00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:04.990
that you have them at
your fingertips, some

00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:07.660
of these enzymes that are
involved in this process.

00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:09.760
Because they should start
to become second nature.

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:15.070
When you have to make a full
DNA copy of an entire genome,

00:09:15.070 --> 00:09:17.180
there's a lot of moving parts.

00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:20.230
But if you start walking
through the logic of them,

00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:21.640
they make sense.

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:24.370
If I'm going to unpeel
DNA, I need a helicase.

00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:26.530
If I'm going to keep
it single stranded,

00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:29.230
I need single strand
binding proteins.

00:09:29.230 --> 00:09:32.470
If I'm going to move forward,
sure, I need the polymerase,

00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:36.250
but what does the
polymerase need?

00:09:36.250 --> 00:09:39.220
It needs a primer in order
to have double strand,

00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:41.260
because DNA
polymerase only wants

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:46.000
to lock onto a double strand
to go start doing its job.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.860
These complications
with the lagging

00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:50.050
strands that are
really annoying,

00:09:50.050 --> 00:09:53.320
but it's pretty remarkable
nature has addressed this

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:56.890
and is able, remember,
to replicate DNA

00:09:56.890 --> 00:10:03.560
and bacteria at a speed of
100 base pairs per second.

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:06.470
So that's what's going
on, this entire process.

00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:06.970
Excuse me.

00:10:06.970 --> 00:10:09.160
1,000 base pairs a second.

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:11.140
I just want you to
remember this process is

00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:13.390
slower in eukaryotes.

00:10:13.390 --> 00:10:18.610
It's about 30 to 50
base pairs per second.

00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:21.070
Obviously, when you're speeding,
you make more mistakes,

00:10:21.070 --> 00:10:28.390
so there are more mistakes in
bacterial genome replication.

00:10:28.390 --> 00:10:31.390
Why does it not matter
so much if there's

00:10:31.390 --> 00:10:35.380
a mistake in a bacterial genome?

00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:37.960
What do you know about
bacteria and their lifestyles?

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:39.820
Do they stick
around a long time?

00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:40.320
No.

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:42.340
So they divide quickly.

00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:43.730
They live and die quickly.

00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:48.610
So you're not having to keep an
intact genome without mistakes

00:10:48.610 --> 00:10:51.700
in it for a long time,
because you're just

00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:52.690
turning over bacteria.

00:10:52.690 --> 00:10:55.210
If there's a mistake,
it probably dies out.

00:10:55.210 --> 00:10:59.560
Or heaven forbid, there's
resistance to drugs developed.

00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:01.060
And we'll talk
about those later,

00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:03.460
because those occur
due to mistakes

00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:05.740
and in bacterial replication.

00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:09.610
But in a eukaryotic
genome, we have

00:11:09.610 --> 00:11:12.310
to preserve the
integrity of the genome.

00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:15.910
So I'm going to talk
about two things that

00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:18.920
are related to the
accuracy of replication

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:21.520
now, because that's a
really important component.

00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:27.670
All right, so the first
thing is to think about,

00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:31.542
what's the basal rate of making
mistakes of DNA polymerase?

00:11:31.542 --> 00:11:33.000
So for that purpose,
I'm just going

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:41.700
to put down a piece of DNA
with its partner that's

00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:46.410
being synthesized, five
prime to three prime.

00:11:46.410 --> 00:11:50.370
And I'll put in some
bases, so A. So that

00:11:50.370 --> 00:11:52.440
would have had a
T put in opposite.

00:11:55.210 --> 00:11:56.800
G, that would have had a C.

00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:59.320
So these have two
hydrogen bonds.

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:01.510
These have three hydrogen bonds.

00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:04.870
And let's say we
now have a C here.

00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:08.080
So we want to put in a G
at the position opposite.

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:13.150
DNA polymerase wants to
add the next base pair.

00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:15.730
It should be a G,
because it's going

00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:19.660
in opposite a C. It's being
grown in the right direction,

00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:21.370
five prime to three prime.

00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:26.560
So the basal error rate
is about 1,000 to 1.

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:32.920
So 999 times out of 1,000,
the right base gets put in.

00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:36.280
1 time out of 1,000, you
might put in the wrong rate.

00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:49.220
So the error rate is
about 1 in 10 to the 3.

00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:50.720
That's really all that's--

00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:53.480
all that's at play
here is energetics,

00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:57.050
just how favorable putting
in the right base is.

00:12:57.050 --> 00:13:00.860
But there's a slight chance that
the wrong base will just go in.

00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:05.203
Because the energetics are
sufficiently different,

00:13:05.203 --> 00:13:06.620
but you're going
to make mistakes,

00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:09.500
just because of the
thermodynamic balance.

00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:12.070
If you're putting
in 999, you're going

00:13:12.070 --> 00:13:15.380
to get it wrong some of the
time, just statistically,

00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:18.290
because the difference
in energy between putting

00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:21.290
in the right base or
putting in a wrong base.

00:13:21.290 --> 00:13:23.840
So that error rate is too high.

00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:27.860
If we replicated our genome,
32 billion base pairs,

00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:31.430
and we had a 1 in 10
to the 3 error rate,

00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:34.460
we'd have a lot of mistakes
in the genome, right?

00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:37.820
And we cannot tolerate that,
because all those mistakes

00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:41.630
in our genome will then
propagate to mistakes

00:13:41.630 --> 00:13:45.330
in our proteome, if we're in the
right segments of the genome.

00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:48.620
So this is pretty unacceptable
with respect to an error rate.

00:13:54.430 --> 00:13:57.550
So one way that
nature deals with this

00:13:57.550 --> 00:14:05.850
is that DNA polymerase actually
does some proofreading,

00:14:05.850 --> 00:14:07.290
all right?

00:14:07.290 --> 00:14:09.315
So it has a
proofreading function.

00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:16.420
So what do you do?

00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:18.400
When you're proofreading,
you take a quick look

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:21.025
at what you've just written and
say, oh, yeah, that looks good.

00:14:21.025 --> 00:14:21.940
That looks good.

00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:24.190
So what DNA polymerase
is-- it more or less

00:14:24.190 --> 00:14:29.110
reaches back to the base it
puts in and checks that it's OK.

00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:31.600
It can only proofread
one base back.

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:34.420
It can't proofread
from work that's

00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:35.830
been done a long time ago.

00:14:35.830 --> 00:14:38.920
It can just proofread
very recent work.

00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:41.590
And if it looks like
it's the wrong base,

00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:44.730
DNA polymerase has
an opposite function.

00:14:44.730 --> 00:14:49.655
It has what's known as a three
prime exonuclease activity.

00:14:49.655 --> 00:14:51.280
So I'll write that
down, and then we'll

00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:52.900
talk about what that means.

00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:56.020
Three prime exonuclease.

00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:07.390
So let's say we put in,
instead of G, we put in a T.

00:15:07.390 --> 00:15:08.590
That's bad news.

00:15:08.590 --> 00:15:12.625
So what it can do is it
can reach back and cut off,

00:15:12.625 --> 00:15:19.180
from the three prime end, a
single nucleotide, the one that

00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:20.890
just got put in, all right?

00:15:20.890 --> 00:15:23.950
And then allow the
process to reoccur

00:15:23.950 --> 00:15:26.210
to get the right base pair in.

00:15:26.210 --> 00:15:28.840
So a lot of enzymes will
catalyze both forwards

00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:30.790
and backwards reactions.

00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:33.790
DNA polymerase, the
energetics of such

00:15:33.790 --> 00:15:36.880
are that it is able
to catalyze both

00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:40.270
the addition of a
nucleotide and the removal

00:15:40.270 --> 00:15:44.710
of a single nucleotide, only
if it's at the three prime end.

00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:48.910
Only if it's at an open end,
where it's just been put in.

00:15:48.910 --> 00:15:51.730
So, remember, the DNA
polymerase is still here,

00:15:51.730 --> 00:15:54.640
because its plan is to
move forward and keep

00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:56.560
on putting in nucleotides.

00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:58.330
But it actually checks back.

00:15:58.330 --> 00:16:00.130
You could picture
DNA pol just sort

00:16:00.130 --> 00:16:02.050
of quickly looking
over its shoulder

00:16:02.050 --> 00:16:05.500
at the work it's just done and
realizing that's the wrong one.

00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:10.720
So what this does is brings the
error rates down considerably.

00:16:16.350 --> 00:16:19.950
Goes in 1 in 10 to the 5.

00:16:19.950 --> 00:16:21.330
So that's way better.

00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:25.630
1 in 100,000 is much better,
and that's pretty acceptable.

00:16:25.630 --> 00:16:29.100
So it means you're really
making very minimal mistakes

00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:30.990
in the replication.

00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:36.800
So this part, the proofreading,
brings the error rate

00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:40.790
from 1 in 10 to the 3
to 1 in 10 to the 5.

00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:46.670
But it can only work during
DNA polymerase activity,

00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:51.200
and it can only work on the
most recent nucleotide that

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:52.910
has been put in.

00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:56.176
So this is basically a
summary of-- yes, question?

00:16:56.176 --> 00:16:59.060
AUDIENCE: So are [INAUDIBLE]
in prokaryotes and eukaryotes?

00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:02.240
BARBARA IMPERIALI: They
are, and they are similar--

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:06.500
actually, there's slightly
less error rates in eukaryotes,

00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:09.060
because the speed is slower.

00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:11.079
So the opportunity to
fix things is going

00:17:11.079 --> 00:17:12.750
to be a little bit better.

00:17:12.750 --> 00:17:15.140
So, in the end,
your goal, really,

00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:18.680
is to bring your error rate
between 10 to the 5 and 10

00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:19.790
to the 6.

00:17:19.790 --> 00:17:23.839
But for bacteria, because
the speed is so much larger,

00:17:23.839 --> 00:17:26.480
this is sort of the limit of it.

00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:29.450
But in eukaryote, it can
be a little bit better,

00:17:29.450 --> 00:17:31.220
because the speed is slower.

00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:33.980
So you could imagine, if
you're quickly proofreading,

00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:36.560
you're doing a less good
job than if you're slowly

00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:37.700
proofreading.

00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:39.890
But the enzymes that
I'll talk to you

00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:44.930
about in a second in eukarya
are to fix entire work that's

00:17:44.930 --> 00:17:45.950
already been done.

00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:47.370
We'll see that in a moment.

00:17:47.370 --> 00:17:48.980
And that's what
really cleans up.

00:17:48.980 --> 00:17:53.000
These enzymes are called
the guardians of the genome,

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.120
and they are much more
sophisticated in eukarya.

00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:57.680
So that's a very good point.

00:17:57.680 --> 00:18:01.460
All right, so here's
the general scheme.

00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:02.760
There is an extension.

00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:04.070
There's a mistake.

00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:05.390
So there's proofreading.

00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:07.040
The mistake gets taken out.

00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:10.940
And then you keep on
extending again, all right?

00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:15.900
So this now becomes pretty good.

00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:18.080
But what we need to
talk about now is,

00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:21.050
what are the enzymes
that go to work--

00:18:21.050 --> 00:18:22.730
and I'm leaving
what's on that board

00:18:22.730 --> 00:18:24.605
there, because I'm going
to come back to it--

00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:31.990
to actually correct
mistakes in DNA.

00:18:31.990 --> 00:18:40.120
So let's talk about the
guardians of the genome.

00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:48.930
Because remember that your
DNA is your permanent record

00:18:48.930 --> 00:18:50.850
of what needs to be made.

00:18:50.850 --> 00:18:54.000
All right, so the
types of mistakes

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.650
that can be fixed
with proofreading

00:18:55.650 --> 00:18:57.225
are only recent mistakes.

00:18:57.225 --> 00:18:59.100
The types of enzymes
I'm going to talk to you

00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:02.010
about mistakes that
are found globally

00:19:02.010 --> 00:19:03.735
within double-stranded DNA.

00:19:13.650 --> 00:19:15.300
And these are mistakes wherever.

00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:19.230
They may be mistakes that didn't
get corrected by proofreading.

00:19:19.230 --> 00:19:21.150
But more importantly,
they're mistakes

00:19:21.150 --> 00:19:24.960
that occur due to some
kind of damage on the DNA.

00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:29.790
So what kind of things might
impact the integrity of our DNA

00:19:29.790 --> 00:19:32.400
on a day-to-day basis?

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:33.160
Yeah?

00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:33.630
AUDIENCE: Sunlight.

00:19:33.630 --> 00:19:34.797
BARBARA IMPERIALI: Sunlight.

00:19:34.797 --> 00:19:37.170
So terrible stuff.

00:19:37.170 --> 00:19:40.340
UV light will actually
cause some cross-links,

00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:43.590
and I'll show you one of those,
that are very serious in DNA.

00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:47.070
What else might hurt the genome?

00:19:47.070 --> 00:19:48.300
So sunlight.

00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:50.168
People say, don't go
out in the sunlight.

00:19:50.168 --> 00:19:51.210
They're right about that.

00:19:51.210 --> 00:19:52.500
What else?

00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:53.073
Yeah?

00:19:53.073 --> 00:19:53.935
AUDIENCE: Radiation.

00:19:53.935 --> 00:19:55.810
BARBARA IMPERIALI:
Radiation is another form.

00:19:55.810 --> 00:19:58.500
So that's like radioactivity.

00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:00.630
Radiation is important, right?

00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:03.930
So if our ozone layer gets
thin, there's more risk there,

00:20:03.930 --> 00:20:05.040
as well.

00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:06.030
What about barbecue?

00:20:06.030 --> 00:20:06.563
Yeah?

00:20:06.563 --> 00:20:07.730
AUDIENCE: Harmful chemicals.

00:20:07.730 --> 00:20:08.730
BARBARA IMPERIALI: Yeah.

00:20:08.730 --> 00:20:11.340
Awful chemicals, terrible
chemicals, right.

00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:14.610
So chemicals.

00:20:14.610 --> 00:20:19.290
So these are things like
polyaromatic structures

00:20:19.290 --> 00:20:22.590
that actually slip into your
genome and cause mistakes

00:20:22.590 --> 00:20:23.730
in the reading.

00:20:23.730 --> 00:20:26.130
Or they actually
physically modify

00:20:26.130 --> 00:20:29.340
the bases to make it a base
that doesn't look like a base

00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:30.130
anymore.

00:20:30.130 --> 00:20:34.340
So these are commonly
very reactive chemicals.

00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:37.880
So these are all very
serious things to the genome.

00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:42.250
And so the enzymes that
mitigate the damage to the DNA

00:20:42.250 --> 00:20:45.940
basically screen along
the double-stranded DNA

00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:47.980
to look for defects.

00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:51.940
Because if you have perfectly
paired DNA, then you're not--

00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:55.330
you're going to have a
very regular structure.

00:20:55.330 --> 00:20:57.785
Whereas, if something
has happened to the DNA,

00:20:57.785 --> 00:20:59.410
there's something
wrong with the base--

00:20:59.410 --> 00:21:03.580
it's not base pairing well
or something has actually

00:21:03.580 --> 00:21:05.350
happened between
bases where they're

00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:07.360
causing a bulge in the genome--

00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:10.000
then these enzymes
will come into play.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.520
About a few years ago--

00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:17.340
actually, it was on a class
day, so I always enjoy these.

00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:21.310
The Nobel Prize
was awarded in 2015

00:21:21.310 --> 00:21:26.290
for the researchers who
deciphered the mechanisms

00:21:26.290 --> 00:21:30.200
for correcting the genome
through DNA repair mechanisms.

00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:32.443
So there are two
basic mechanisms

00:21:32.443 --> 00:21:33.610
that I'll talk to you about.

00:21:38.140 --> 00:21:43.215
One is base excision repair.

00:21:49.650 --> 00:21:53.200
And the other one is
a lot more serious.

00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:56.170
It's actually the entire
nucleotide excision repair.

00:21:56.170 --> 00:21:59.430
So one fixes just the
base that's gone wrong,

00:21:59.430 --> 00:22:02.700
but the other one takes much
more of the structure out

00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:03.870
to fix it.

00:22:03.870 --> 00:22:12.320
So it's nucleotide
excision repair.

00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:18.250
So BER and NER, and
we're going to talk

00:22:18.250 --> 00:22:21.340
about both of those
mechanisms, because they're

00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:22.390
very fascinating.

00:22:22.390 --> 00:22:25.450
And they kind of lean on some
of what you've learned already.

00:22:25.450 --> 00:22:28.660
So base excision
repair occurs when

00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:30.430
there's a defect in the base.

00:22:30.430 --> 00:22:31.810
Maybe it's the wrong base.

00:22:31.810 --> 00:22:34.580
Maybe it's just been
modified a little bit.

00:22:34.580 --> 00:22:38.635
So what happens in base excision
repair is that the base gets--

00:22:38.635 --> 00:22:40.510
all right, I'm going to
just use the pointer,

00:22:40.510 --> 00:22:42.730
because my little
spotlight-- it'll pop back.

00:22:42.730 --> 00:22:43.960
It's a bit magical.

00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:48.070
So base excision repair, only
the base, a single localized

00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:49.660
base, is damaged.

00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:52.640
There is some
chemistry, for example,

00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:57.460
that will convert cytosine to
uracil called a deamination

00:22:57.460 --> 00:22:58.630
mechanism.

00:22:58.630 --> 00:23:02.320
And in fact, if you replace
the cytosine with a uracil,

00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:04.090
then you get in
trouble with respect

00:23:04.090 --> 00:23:08.830
to its base pairing with its
appropriate purine partner.

00:23:08.830 --> 00:23:12.160
So in base excision
repair, what will happen

00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:14.770
is that base will be detected.

00:23:14.770 --> 00:23:19.660
It will be flipped out from the
context of double-stranded DNA.

00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:22.180
If it's tucked in the
double-stranded DNA,

00:23:22.180 --> 00:23:24.340
you can't quite
cut the bond that's

00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:27.130
attached from the ribose
sugar to the base.

00:23:27.130 --> 00:23:30.490
So the base gets flipped
out of the DNA structure.

00:23:30.490 --> 00:23:33.400
And there's an enzyme
known as a glycosylase that

00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:36.970
cuts the bond between
the ribose and the base

00:23:36.970 --> 00:23:38.990
and gets rid of it.

00:23:38.990 --> 00:23:42.520
And then what happens is
the rest of the nucleotide,

00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:45.490
just that one
nucleotide, gets removed.

00:23:45.490 --> 00:23:48.520
And then DNA polymerase
fills the gap,

00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:50.980
and the strand is
sealed by a ligase.

00:23:50.980 --> 00:23:55.300
So a glycosylase
cuts the base out.

00:23:55.300 --> 00:23:57.460
There's a couple of
enzymes that actually

00:23:57.460 --> 00:24:02.470
cut the ribose, the
phosphodiester linkages out.

00:24:02.470 --> 00:24:04.720
And then the two
enzymes, remember,

00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:06.610
that are important
when we're making

00:24:06.610 --> 00:24:11.500
DNA, the polymerase
and the ligase,

00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:14.920
work together to put a
base into this position.

00:24:17.430 --> 00:24:23.560
And then they put
the base back in,

00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:25.390
and then the ligase
joins the gap.

00:24:25.390 --> 00:24:28.420
So DNA polymerase will
make one of the bonds.

00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:30.970
The ligase will make the
other bond, all right?

00:24:30.970 --> 00:24:36.730
So that's base excision
repair, and it's

00:24:36.730 --> 00:24:40.870
monitored by finding that
there is a lack of integrity

00:24:40.870 --> 00:24:43.060
in the double-stranded DNA.

00:24:43.060 --> 00:24:45.220
It's only a base
that's affected,

00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:47.380
so that base gets removed.

00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:50.560
The rest of the nucleotide is
removed, but only one of them.

00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:53.140
And then they're replaced
through the concerted action

00:24:53.140 --> 00:24:55.330
of polymerase and ligase.

00:24:55.330 --> 00:24:58.900
Now, there is another mechanism
that's much more serious,

00:24:58.900 --> 00:25:01.810
and this is very typical
of the types of damage

00:25:01.810 --> 00:25:05.620
that get formed from
sunlight and UV radiation,

00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:09.340
is when two thymidines are
adjacent to each other, they

00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:13.420
will undergo, quite commonly,
a chemical reaction where

00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:15.610
they form a dimeric structure.

00:25:15.610 --> 00:25:19.930
So there's much more
wrong with the DNA

00:25:19.930 --> 00:25:21.890
strand in that situation.

00:25:21.890 --> 00:25:23.770
So those get noticed.

00:25:23.770 --> 00:25:26.380
This thing's driving me nuts.

00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:30.370
Those get noticed as a
real defect in the DNA.

00:25:30.370 --> 00:25:32.720
Base excision repair won't work.

00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:33.610
Why wouldn't it work?

00:25:36.140 --> 00:25:36.685
Yeah?

00:25:36.685 --> 00:25:38.560
AUDIENCE: Because the
two are bound together.

00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:39.640
BARBARA IMPERIALI: Yeah,
they're bound together.

00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:41.200
You can't peel them back out.

00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:43.030
You can't break
in that structure.

00:25:43.030 --> 00:25:48.300
So you've got to move to a
much more sort of major fixing

00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:52.250
of the DNA strand.

00:25:52.250 --> 00:25:55.000
So there is a genetically
linked disorder

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:59.230
where the enzymes involved
in nucleotide excision repair

00:25:59.230 --> 00:26:00.640
do not work.

00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:05.200
And when a child has a copy
of both defective genes

00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:08.860
from the parents, both one
from the mother and the father,

00:26:08.860 --> 00:26:12.820
it's impossible for them to
fix these defects in the DNA.

00:26:12.820 --> 00:26:15.940
And they get a lot of
physiologic problems

00:26:15.940 --> 00:26:21.070
like sort of scarring and
sunburns, barely anything

00:26:21.070 --> 00:26:22.110
at all.

00:26:22.110 --> 00:26:27.940
So this is a group of children
that are so afflicted with this

00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:31.150
genetic disorders that they
cannot go out in the daytime

00:26:31.150 --> 00:26:32.080
at all.

00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:35.200
So you'll sometimes see they're
called Children of the Night,

00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:37.840
because basically, they have
to flip their schedules.

00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:39.843
They just can't
go near sunlight.

00:26:39.843 --> 00:26:41.260
And if they go
out, they basically

00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:43.180
have to be covered
from head to toe.

00:26:43.180 --> 00:26:45.820
And that's including
their eyes, because you

00:26:45.820 --> 00:26:47.770
can get sunburn of the eyes.

00:26:47.770 --> 00:26:50.590
You can sort of see, in
some of these pictures,

00:26:50.590 --> 00:26:53.860
that it looks really
serious defects.

00:26:53.860 --> 00:26:57.490
And this is just the
external manifestation.

00:26:57.490 --> 00:27:02.120
The internal manifestation would
be cases of skin cancer very,

00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:03.290
very readily.

00:27:03.290 --> 00:27:06.460
So if you don't have
at least one good copy

00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:09.520
of the enzyme that does
nucleotide excision repair,

00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:11.020
then you're in trouble.

00:27:11.020 --> 00:27:13.030
And the defects are called--

00:27:13.030 --> 00:27:16.070
it's called xeroderma
pigmentosum.

00:27:16.070 --> 00:27:18.130
And there's actually
a lot of family groups

00:27:18.130 --> 00:27:21.160
that get together, because
the best way is just

00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:25.060
to form a sort of social network
so the children understand

00:27:25.060 --> 00:27:28.120
what each other-- the
limitations that they all have.

00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:30.010
And they can play
together and be

00:27:30.010 --> 00:27:32.020
on these sort of
flipped schedules

00:27:32.020 --> 00:27:35.230
in order to avoid any sunlight.

00:27:35.230 --> 00:27:39.730
So, in this case, it's
essential to basically clip out

00:27:39.730 --> 00:27:41.830
a large chunk of the DNA.

00:27:41.830 --> 00:27:46.450
So what happens in this case
is that the DNA is recognized,

00:27:46.450 --> 00:27:49.960
and then a large portion of
it-- about a dozen nucleotides--

00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:51.250
are cleaved out.

00:27:51.250 --> 00:27:55.630
And then, once again, DNA
polymerase fills the gap,

00:27:55.630 --> 00:27:58.630
and DNA ligase
seals the last gap.

00:27:58.630 --> 00:28:01.660
So DNA polymerase
will be able to fill

00:28:01.660 --> 00:28:04.090
going from the five
prime to three prime.

00:28:04.090 --> 00:28:07.090
There'll still be one gap,
and then the ligase fixes it.

00:28:07.090 --> 00:28:09.190
So I think these
kinds of things that

00:28:09.190 --> 00:28:11.590
are done to mitigate
damage on the genome

00:28:11.590 --> 00:28:13.750
are very important
to understand,

00:28:13.750 --> 00:28:16.090
because this is
happening all the time.

00:28:16.090 --> 00:28:18.460
Any minor things
that get fixed, that

00:28:18.460 --> 00:28:22.180
need fixing due to sunlight,
radiation, chemicals

00:28:22.180 --> 00:28:24.040
will be fixed
through these methods

00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:27.940
to keep that rate, that error
rate, in your genome down to,

00:28:27.940 --> 00:28:31.330
like, one in a billion
or something like that.

00:28:31.330 --> 00:28:34.150
All right, I'm just
going to flash this up.

00:28:34.150 --> 00:28:36.870
I'm going to, very quickly.

00:28:36.870 --> 00:28:39.600
I'm going to give you
guys a copy of this.

00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:42.390
But these are the
components that you

00:28:42.390 --> 00:28:48.890
want to be able to understand
the function of when

00:28:48.890 --> 00:28:52.257
thinking about DNA replication.

00:28:52.257 --> 00:28:53.840
So you don't have
that on your slides,

00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:56.215
but we're going to give you
a copy so that you can really

00:28:56.215 --> 00:28:58.970
make sure that you understand
all the moving parts

00:28:58.970 --> 00:29:02.250
and how they come
together for replication.

00:29:02.250 --> 00:29:06.050
Now I want to talk about
one last conundrum with DNA,

00:29:06.050 --> 00:29:09.350
and that is the
issue of telomerase.

00:29:15.790 --> 00:29:22.350
And this is particularly
critical in eukaryotes

00:29:22.350 --> 00:29:26.630
that have linear chromosomes.

00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:35.560
Now, if you think about
DNA being replicated,

00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:42.160
when you look at the
two strands of DNA,

00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:44.800
as you approach the very
end of the chromosome,

00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:53.620
you'll do just fine making the
copy that's built five primes--

00:29:53.620 --> 00:29:54.500
sorry about this.

00:30:09.150 --> 00:30:11.730
You'll do just fine
making the copy that

00:30:11.730 --> 00:30:14.970
is built in this
direction, because it's

00:30:14.970 --> 00:30:16.410
the leading strand.

00:30:16.410 --> 00:30:17.505
And it's built five prime.

00:30:21.310 --> 00:30:23.370
Am I going wrong here?

00:30:23.370 --> 00:30:24.930
It's built five
prime to three prime.

00:30:28.512 --> 00:30:29.720
Can someone help me out here?

00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:30.630
I'm losing my mind.

00:30:33.630 --> 00:30:38.310
So this piece is built
five prime to three prime,

00:30:38.310 --> 00:30:41.250
so therefore, this was
five prime and three prime.

00:30:41.250 --> 00:30:43.560
But then on the
other strand, you

00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:48.150
have a problem, because you
need to put in a primer here

00:30:48.150 --> 00:30:50.430
in order to build
the other strand.

00:30:50.430 --> 00:30:51.880
Does that make sense?

00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:54.720
So we've got to have put
in that short primer,

00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:58.740
because DNA polymerase is
will not work otherwise.

00:30:58.740 --> 00:31:03.990
And then we need to
build this strand of DNA.

00:31:03.990 --> 00:31:07.920
All right, so what's the
problem here with respect

00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:10.650
to these ends?

00:31:10.650 --> 00:31:13.266
What's going to happen next?

00:31:13.266 --> 00:31:17.900
If it's an RNA primer,
what happens next?

00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:21.100
We nibble it up, right,
with the full intention

00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:23.440
of replacing that bit of DNA.

00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:26.350
But then what can
DNA polymerase do?

00:31:26.350 --> 00:31:28.330
It can't do anything, right?

00:31:28.330 --> 00:31:32.350
DNA polymerase needs
double-stranded DNA

00:31:32.350 --> 00:31:35.780
to hold on to so it
could fill this gap.

00:31:35.780 --> 00:31:42.160
So what happens is every
time you replicate DNA,

00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:46.250
you end up with a gap,
with a small amount

00:31:46.250 --> 00:31:47.420
you don't quite copy.

00:31:47.420 --> 00:31:49.310
Is everyone following me?

00:31:49.310 --> 00:31:50.540
And that's a problem, right?

00:31:50.540 --> 00:31:51.957
Because doesn't
it mean every time

00:31:51.957 --> 00:31:54.950
my cells divide, my genes
get a little bit shorter

00:31:54.950 --> 00:31:57.830
and a little bit shorter
and a little bit shorter?

00:31:57.830 --> 00:32:01.880
So there are things
in place that help.

00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:04.910
One important feature
is that, usually, you

00:32:04.910 --> 00:32:08.500
don't have important
genetic material

00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:12.360
at the ends of your genes--

00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:14.840
at the ends of
chromosomes, rather.

00:32:18.370 --> 00:32:25.190
There's sort of extra DNA that
doesn't need to be copied.

00:32:25.190 --> 00:32:28.360
But the basic theory, the
whole theory about telomerase,

00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:31.150
is that for certain
types of cells--

00:32:31.150 --> 00:32:36.450
these ascend stem
cells and germ cells--

00:32:39.870 --> 00:32:44.070
there is an enzyme
that can fill this gap.

00:32:44.070 --> 00:32:45.660
It's called telomerase.

00:32:52.630 --> 00:32:55.420
So in those cells-- what's
special about these types

00:32:55.420 --> 00:32:58.340
of cells?

00:32:58.340 --> 00:33:00.290
We need to keep them good.

00:33:00.290 --> 00:33:03.200
They're what defines
your starting DNA.

00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:05.810
The stem cells and
the germ cells,

00:33:05.810 --> 00:33:12.992
like in the sperm and egg, have
to have a good copy of DNA.

00:33:12.992 --> 00:33:14.700
They can't be getting
shorter and shorter

00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:17.520
every time a new
generation is born.

00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:20.470
But once your cells
are the somatic cells,

00:33:20.470 --> 00:33:22.710
the DNA gets
shorter and shorter,

00:33:22.710 --> 00:33:26.670
because those cells
don't have telomerase.

00:33:26.670 --> 00:33:29.890
And this is associated
with theories of aging.

00:33:29.890 --> 00:33:32.730
So the cells you get,
the ones that are finally

00:33:32.730 --> 00:33:34.740
the ones in your
body, every time

00:33:34.740 --> 00:33:38.430
they divide, the ends
of the chromosomes

00:33:38.430 --> 00:33:39.600
will get a little shorter.

00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:42.420
But there's no mechanism
to replace those.

00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:45.030
And so it's associated
with the belief

00:33:45.030 --> 00:33:49.170
that, at a certain stage, you've
divided the cells enough times.

00:33:49.170 --> 00:33:51.210
And then you can't--

00:33:51.210 --> 00:33:55.110
you're actually starting to
nibble into important coding

00:33:55.110 --> 00:33:56.430
DNA.

00:33:56.430 --> 00:33:58.380
Does everybody
understand what would

00:33:58.380 --> 00:34:00.715
be the significance of that?

00:34:00.715 --> 00:34:01.590
Does that make sense?

00:34:01.590 --> 00:34:02.227
Yeah?

00:34:02.227 --> 00:34:03.688
AUDIENCE: So once
the [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:03.688 --> 00:34:05.743
are gone, is this
[INAUDIBLE] able to divide?

00:34:05.743 --> 00:34:06.660
BARBARA IMPERIALI: No.

00:34:06.660 --> 00:34:11.969
So the telomerase keeps
the DNA in those types

00:34:11.969 --> 00:34:14.850
of cells in good condition.

00:34:14.850 --> 00:34:18.750
In the cells that divide
daily, and your body wants--

00:34:18.750 --> 00:34:20.100
the somatic cells.

00:34:20.100 --> 00:34:22.110
You will keep on
shortening, but they'll just

00:34:22.110 --> 00:34:24.245
be more mistakes, basically.

00:34:24.245 --> 00:34:25.620
And those are the
sorts of things

00:34:25.620 --> 00:34:28.320
that would be associated
with an organism that's

00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:31.020
growing to a certain
age, because it's just

00:34:31.020 --> 00:34:32.179
a certain number of cells.

00:34:32.179 --> 00:34:34.380
So the cells may
not divide, or there

00:34:34.380 --> 00:34:39.070
may be mistakes in certain
parts of the coding genome.

00:34:39.070 --> 00:34:40.489
Any other questions?

00:34:40.489 --> 00:34:46.320
OK, so telomerase was also
another important discovery

00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:48.810
that was awarded a Nobel Prize.

00:34:48.810 --> 00:34:50.520
And this gives you details.

00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:54.420
So the telomerase protects
the genetic information

00:34:54.420 --> 00:34:58.470
on every cell
division, though you

00:34:58.470 --> 00:35:00.940
will lose a little bit
of genetic information.

00:35:00.940 --> 00:35:02.820
So it limits the
number of divisions

00:35:02.820 --> 00:35:06.180
a cell can make in a lifetime.

00:35:06.180 --> 00:35:08.790
All right, so we're
going to move on now.

00:35:08.790 --> 00:35:10.750
And I've spent quite
a bit of time on this,

00:35:10.750 --> 00:35:13.410
but I want to
guarantee you that now,

00:35:13.410 --> 00:35:16.320
as we move forward
to transcription,

00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:18.810
there's a few simplifications
that we can make

00:35:18.810 --> 00:35:21.670
in the story of transcription.

00:35:25.650 --> 00:35:28.230
So moving on.

00:35:28.230 --> 00:35:29.340
All right.

00:35:29.340 --> 00:35:31.050
So what have we done so far?

00:35:31.050 --> 00:35:33.100
We've seen replication.

00:35:33.100 --> 00:35:39.890
Now we're moving to the
process of transcription.

00:35:47.490 --> 00:35:50.090
So when you
transcribe something,

00:35:50.090 --> 00:35:52.950
you're basically making
a copy of something,

00:35:52.950 --> 00:35:55.520
but in a slightly
different format.

00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:58.970
So, for example, if you're
transcribing from handwritten

00:35:58.970 --> 00:36:01.940
to a typed version,
you go from something

00:36:01.940 --> 00:36:04.460
that's in the script to
something that's typed.

00:36:04.460 --> 00:36:08.130
It has the same content, but
it's in a different format.

00:36:08.130 --> 00:36:10.460
So this is what the
process is called

00:36:10.460 --> 00:36:21.030
when you convert DNA into RNA.

00:36:21.030 --> 00:36:24.090
And very specifically,
this is part

00:36:24.090 --> 00:36:29.020
of the process to make what's
known as the messenger RNA.

00:36:29.020 --> 00:36:33.420
The first phase of transcription
in eukaryotic cells

00:36:33.420 --> 00:36:38.050
gets us to a pre-messenger RNA.

00:36:38.050 --> 00:36:39.960
So there's a little
bit more needs

00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:43.020
to be done to it before
it can leave the nucleus

00:36:43.020 --> 00:36:45.750
to encode protein translation.

00:36:45.750 --> 00:36:47.670
But in bacteria,
you're basically

00:36:47.670 --> 00:36:51.540
just going straight from the
DNA to the messenger RNA.

00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:53.940
At the beginning
of the next class,

00:36:53.940 --> 00:36:59.160
we will also talk about going
from the pre-messenger RNA

00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:00.620
to the messenger RNA.

00:37:00.620 --> 00:37:02.100
And let's take a
look at the cell

00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:06.900
up here, where what
we're focusing in on here

00:37:06.900 --> 00:37:14.570
is the process whereby
we're copying that DNA.

00:37:14.570 --> 00:37:17.420
I have no idea why
this is really being

00:37:17.420 --> 00:37:19.760
monstrously behaved like that.

00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:22.850
I'm done, done
with these gizmos.

00:37:22.850 --> 00:37:26.450
The process whereby the
double-stranded DNA opens up

00:37:26.450 --> 00:37:29.270
a little bit and we make
that pre-messenger RNA

00:37:29.270 --> 00:37:30.470
copy, all right?

00:37:30.470 --> 00:37:32.570
So I want you to think
back to the processes

00:37:32.570 --> 00:37:35.250
that we learned about
for translation.

00:37:35.250 --> 00:37:37.040
And now we're going
to move forward

00:37:37.040 --> 00:37:39.470
to take a look at transcription.

00:37:39.470 --> 00:37:41.770
And frankly, it's a lot simpler.

00:37:41.770 --> 00:37:45.097
So let's just look at the
players in transcription.

00:37:45.097 --> 00:37:46.930
And you've got a copy
of this in your notes,

00:37:46.930 --> 00:37:49.650
so I don't need to necessarily
put it all on the board.

00:37:49.650 --> 00:37:55.280
So in DNA, remember, we had a A,
G, C, T. We have a deoxyribose,

00:37:55.280 --> 00:38:01.010
and it's mostly used as
hereditary genetic information.

00:38:01.010 --> 00:38:04.790
But in RNA, we're
making a new copy

00:38:04.790 --> 00:38:08.360
of the DNA, where we use
slightly different building

00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:09.290
blocks--

00:38:09.290 --> 00:38:12.200
A, G, C, U. U
instead of T. Plus,

00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:14.510
there are some
modified bases that

00:38:14.510 --> 00:38:18.770
occur in some of the types of
RNA, and the sugar is a ribose.

00:38:18.770 --> 00:38:22.190
So the first main thing
about the RNA copy

00:38:22.190 --> 00:38:26.900
relative to the DNA copy is that
ribose/deoxyribose difference.

00:38:26.900 --> 00:38:29.090
What's quite
remarkable is that when

00:38:29.090 --> 00:38:34.620
you have two deoxyribose in
your DNA, it's nice and stable.

00:38:34.620 --> 00:38:36.740
We need it to be
nice and stable.

00:38:36.740 --> 00:38:37.700
It's our genome.

00:38:37.700 --> 00:38:40.400
We can't let our
genome be falling apart

00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:42.800
as we're sort of
walking down the street.

00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:47.960
In contrast, when RNA is used,
it's much more transient.

00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:51.680
We make a messenger
RNA copy of part of DNA

00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:53.930
to move forward
to make proteins,

00:38:53.930 --> 00:38:57.240
but we don't need that
to stick around forever.

00:38:57.240 --> 00:39:00.620
And when you have the ribose
with the two hydroxyls, a two

00:39:00.620 --> 00:39:03.590
and three, it's a much
more fragile material.

00:39:03.590 --> 00:39:09.020
It is a transient message, and
it gets degraded quite quickly.

00:39:09.020 --> 00:39:11.060
So that difference
in the sugar really

00:39:11.060 --> 00:39:13.640
dictates the stability there.

00:39:13.640 --> 00:39:17.960
RNA is found in a lot of
polymers, biopolymers.

00:39:17.960 --> 00:39:22.130
We'll talk we'll focus mostly
on the messenger RNA today.

00:39:22.130 --> 00:39:25.400
It's less than 1% of the DNA.

00:39:25.400 --> 00:39:28.250
And then on Friday, we'll be
talking about the transfer

00:39:28.250 --> 00:39:30.680
RNA and the ribosomal RNA.

00:39:30.680 --> 00:39:32.570
So we're really
going to focus in

00:39:32.570 --> 00:39:36.920
right now on the messenger RNA.

00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:41.350
And the one thing about RNA
structures I'll elaborate later

00:39:41.350 --> 00:39:43.550
is they have very
different structures

00:39:43.550 --> 00:39:46.700
to canonical DNA, which
adopts the double-stranded,

00:39:46.700 --> 00:39:48.770
anti-parallel structure.

00:39:48.770 --> 00:39:54.380
RNA structures are much more
like folded protein structures,

00:39:54.380 --> 00:39:56.840
where there may be
sections of base pairing,

00:39:56.840 --> 00:39:58.790
but there'll also
be lots of loops

00:39:58.790 --> 00:40:00.840
and different characteristics.

00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:05.330
So even the ribose
structure makes a difference

00:40:05.330 --> 00:40:08.600
in the stability of the
double stranded structure

00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:12.140
and encourages a lot more of
these unusual structures, which

00:40:12.140 --> 00:40:14.990
is really why people
have a lot of faith

00:40:14.990 --> 00:40:20.500
in the theories
about the RNA world.

00:40:20.500 --> 00:40:24.720
OK, so let's look at DNA
polymerase, RNA polymerase.

00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:26.960
So here's all the
good news that we'll

00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:29.000
be able to describe to you.

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:32.630
So when you copy DNA,
you copy all of it.

00:40:32.630 --> 00:40:35.180
When you copy RNA,
you only copy--

00:40:35.180 --> 00:40:37.940
when you make the
copy of messenger RNA,

00:40:37.940 --> 00:40:41.600
you only copy about
1.5% of the genome.

00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:44.060
So you do not copy
the entire thing.

00:40:44.060 --> 00:40:48.710
So the process is much more
restricted to sections of DNA

00:40:48.710 --> 00:40:49.940
that need to be copied.

00:40:49.940 --> 00:40:53.780
And we'll talk about the
features of the DNA that

00:40:53.780 --> 00:40:55.110
tell you about that later.

00:40:58.640 --> 00:41:01.820
Here's the important details.

00:41:01.820 --> 00:41:06.410
So in eukaryotes, transcription
happens in the nucleus.

00:41:06.410 --> 00:41:18.170
And the key enzyme involved
is RNA polymerase, RNA pol.

00:41:18.170 --> 00:41:22.750
And it has very different
features to DNA polymerase,

00:41:22.750 --> 00:41:25.380
but there are two big
things that are different.

00:41:25.380 --> 00:41:32.830
It includes its own helicase.

00:41:32.830 --> 00:41:34.690
So you remember,
with replication, we

00:41:34.690 --> 00:41:37.690
needed a DNA polymerase
and a helicase.

00:41:37.690 --> 00:41:40.030
RNA polymerase is much
smarter than that.

00:41:40.030 --> 00:41:44.200
It actually includes both
functions within its structure.

00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:49.660
So it's an RNA polymerase
that grows the new nucleotide

00:41:49.660 --> 00:41:50.860
five prime to three prime.

00:41:50.860 --> 00:41:53.620
But it also has a
built-in helicase,

00:41:53.620 --> 00:41:56.440
so that's an advantage.

00:41:56.440 --> 00:42:06.600
It still grows the messenger
RNA five prime to three prime,

00:42:06.600 --> 00:42:10.050
but it uses the different
nucleotide triphosphate

00:42:10.050 --> 00:42:10.950
building blocks.

00:42:10.950 --> 00:42:12.690
Or one of them is different.

00:42:12.690 --> 00:42:16.965
So UTP, ATP.

00:42:21.890 --> 00:42:26.330
So remember, the U
replaces the T in RNA,

00:42:26.330 --> 00:42:28.250
so that's one key difference.

00:42:32.750 --> 00:42:35.430
It includes a helicase activity.

00:42:35.430 --> 00:42:38.850
And the other really
neat thing, because it's

00:42:38.850 --> 00:42:42.360
such a complication
in replication,

00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:47.680
is it doesn't require a primer.

00:42:53.770 --> 00:42:56.980
That is why even when we
were replicating the DNA,

00:42:56.980 --> 00:42:59.530
we were using RNA
polymerase to make

00:42:59.530 --> 00:43:02.080
those little pieces
of primers, because it

00:43:02.080 --> 00:43:04.900
didn't need a priming sequence.

00:43:04.900 --> 00:43:07.660
So there's really
fundamental differences

00:43:07.660 --> 00:43:09.700
about the RNA polymerase.

00:43:09.700 --> 00:43:12.220
And then the other thing
is that only one of the two

00:43:12.220 --> 00:43:14.650
strands of DNA is transcribed.

00:43:14.650 --> 00:43:17.950
And in a moment, or maybe
the beginning of next class,

00:43:17.950 --> 00:43:21.580
we'll judge how
we can understand

00:43:21.580 --> 00:43:25.510
which sequence is transcribed.

00:43:25.510 --> 00:43:28.660
And then, obviously,
the messenger RNA

00:43:28.660 --> 00:43:31.750
is a complementary sequence
to the sequence of DNA

00:43:31.750 --> 00:43:34.560
that is being copied.

00:43:34.560 --> 00:43:39.180
Finally, only part of
the DNA is transcribed,

00:43:39.180 --> 00:43:42.090
under unlike the
process of replication.

00:43:42.090 --> 00:43:44.340
All right, so you
can see already

00:43:44.340 --> 00:43:46.740
that there are a lot
of simplifications

00:43:46.740 --> 00:43:49.680
in transcription that we
did not have the advantage

00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:51.150
of in replication.

00:43:51.150 --> 00:43:54.750
So the helicase activity
and the primary issue

00:43:54.750 --> 00:43:59.260
are two key features that
make life a lot simpler.

00:43:59.260 --> 00:44:03.630
I just wanted to show you
this small detail about RNA

00:44:03.630 --> 00:44:05.430
polymerase.

00:44:05.430 --> 00:44:08.130
There are a lot of
natural products out there

00:44:08.130 --> 00:44:12.330
that are known to be
inhibitors of vital processes,

00:44:12.330 --> 00:44:18.540
and one that caught my eye
is the small molecules that

00:44:18.540 --> 00:44:21.960
are found in mushrooms, the
really toxic mushrooms, when

00:44:21.960 --> 00:44:22.960
you see some of these.

00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:26.380
In fact, never eat a
mushroom that you don't know

00:44:26.380 --> 00:44:28.380
and you know where it
came from, because there's

00:44:28.380 --> 00:44:29.400
problems with them.

00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:31.170
Because a lot of these
mushrooms include

00:44:31.170 --> 00:44:33.150
potent natural products.

00:44:33.150 --> 00:44:35.250
And in fact, there's
a compound known

00:44:35.250 --> 00:44:37.830
as amanitin,
alpha-amanitin, and it's

00:44:37.830 --> 00:44:42.360
found in certain mushrooms
known as either the Death Cap

00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:44.423
or Destroying Angel mushrooms.

00:44:44.423 --> 00:44:45.840
So you could tell
from their names

00:44:45.840 --> 00:44:47.400
that they are a real problem.

00:44:47.400 --> 00:44:52.500
And what the amanitin does is
it actually interferes directly

00:44:52.500 --> 00:44:58.610
with RNA polymerase by acting as
an allosteric inhibitor of RNA

00:44:58.610 --> 00:45:01.520
polymerase and locking
it into a closed state

00:45:01.520 --> 00:45:03.860
so it can't keep
on transcribing.

00:45:03.860 --> 00:45:07.240
So I thought this was very
interesting, incredibly.

00:45:07.240 --> 00:45:12.770
Tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny doses
will arrest transcription

00:45:12.770 --> 00:45:17.250
and cause dire consequences.

00:45:17.250 --> 00:45:20.780
So I think what's very
interesting is that it's

00:45:20.780 --> 00:45:22.130
an allosteric inhibitor.

00:45:22.130 --> 00:45:23.560
It's very potent.

00:45:23.560 --> 00:45:26.210
What it does is it
seals the polymerase

00:45:26.210 --> 00:45:29.060
in a locked, closed state
that it can't move forward

00:45:29.060 --> 00:45:31.130
for transcription.

00:45:31.130 --> 00:45:34.280
Now, finally, a
couple of points.

00:45:34.280 --> 00:45:37.220
When we decide that
a portion of gene

00:45:37.220 --> 00:45:40.340
is going to be
transcribed, there

00:45:40.340 --> 00:45:43.010
are a lot of mechanisms
in place to identify

00:45:43.010 --> 00:45:44.810
the portion of that gene.

00:45:44.810 --> 00:45:46.550
And one of the key
things that is known

00:45:46.550 --> 00:45:50.300
is that there are what are
called promoter sites, which

00:45:50.300 --> 00:45:52.730
are actually upstream
of the portion of gene

00:45:52.730 --> 00:45:57.860
that's to be transcribed, where
you recruit a bunch of proteins

00:45:57.860 --> 00:46:02.930
that actually park down on the
double-stranded DNA and then,

00:46:02.930 --> 00:46:07.350
at the end of the day,
recruit the RNA polymerase.

00:46:07.350 --> 00:46:09.440
So all that extra
genome, some of it

00:46:09.440 --> 00:46:12.530
is not transcribed
into messenger RNA

00:46:12.530 --> 00:46:14.810
for making proteins,
but it's part

00:46:14.810 --> 00:46:18.500
of an area of the gene
that gets recognized

00:46:18.500 --> 00:46:21.350
by all of the proteins
that collaborate

00:46:21.350 --> 00:46:23.960
to bring in the RNA
polymerase in order

00:46:23.960 --> 00:46:26.820
for your RNA to be transcribed.

00:46:26.820 --> 00:46:31.520
So what I'm showing you here is
a double-stranded DNA with one

00:46:31.520 --> 00:46:33.540
of the very common
promoters that's

00:46:33.540 --> 00:46:37.370
just upstream of the part of
the DNA that gets transcribed.

00:46:37.370 --> 00:46:41.300
And it's called the TATA box,
because it's T-A-T-A sequence.

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:46.670
It's got a complement
that looks like it.

00:46:46.670 --> 00:46:49.040
And it's shown in pink here.

00:46:49.040 --> 00:46:54.440
And then the proteins that
bind to the DNA at the TATA box

00:46:54.440 --> 00:46:58.670
actually drape over that
segment of double-stranded DNA

00:46:58.670 --> 00:47:00.800
and then serve as
recruitment entities

00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:05.120
to bring in all the machinery
that's needed for transcription

00:47:05.120 --> 00:47:07.140
of the gene beyond it.

00:47:07.140 --> 00:47:12.080
So some of the identity of all
that extra double-stranded DNA

00:47:12.080 --> 00:47:15.350
is actually guide
places to guide

00:47:15.350 --> 00:47:17.780
where the machinery
for transcription

00:47:17.780 --> 00:47:23.670
has to park in order for
messenger RNA to be formed.

00:47:23.670 --> 00:47:25.520
So immediately, you
can see we're only

00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:31.460
going to transcribe part of this
genetic material beyond here.

00:47:31.460 --> 00:47:34.550
But we need a whole
bunch of genetic material

00:47:34.550 --> 00:47:36.410
that's actually
just serving as sort

00:47:36.410 --> 00:47:39.880
of the runway for the plane
landing in the right position,

00:47:39.880 --> 00:47:40.760
all right?

00:47:40.760 --> 00:47:47.880
So I'm going to put up a puzzle
that you can think about.

00:47:47.880 --> 00:47:49.880
And then we'll start with
these at the beginning

00:47:49.880 --> 00:47:52.460
of the next class, because
I don't want to rush them.

00:47:52.460 --> 00:47:55.760
When you decide to
transcribe a gene--

00:47:55.760 --> 00:47:58.640
let's say you've got
a promoter site here--

00:47:58.640 --> 00:48:00.410
the thing that I want
you to think about

00:48:00.410 --> 00:48:03.220
is, which strand
would you transcribe?

00:48:03.220 --> 00:48:05.390
And what's the
logic behind this?

00:48:05.390 --> 00:48:07.340
And then we'll just
do a recap on this

00:48:07.340 --> 00:48:08.900
at the beginning
of the next class,

00:48:08.900 --> 00:48:10.650
because I just want
you to think about it.

00:48:10.650 --> 00:48:14.010
Because a lot of the information
you need is directly here.

00:48:14.010 --> 00:48:14.510
Hi there.

00:48:14.510 --> 00:48:15.850
We're just wrapping up.

00:48:15.850 --> 00:48:16.410
OK?

00:48:16.410 --> 00:48:18.550
So that's it for today.

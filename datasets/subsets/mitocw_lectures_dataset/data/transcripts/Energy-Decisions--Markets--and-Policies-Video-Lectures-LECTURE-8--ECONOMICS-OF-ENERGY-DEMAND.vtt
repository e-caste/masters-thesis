RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Today, we're

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:28.150
talking about energy demand.

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:31.880
I do owe you 2 pictures however,
which I will now supply.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:37.400
The first is-- that's
Bangladesh as it

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.430
is today with 112
million people,

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:45.410
and as it would be with a meter
and a half sea level rise,

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.910
about 17 million people
or 15% of the population

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.160
live in the areas
that would be flooded.

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.350
A meter and a half
may be a little

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.440
aggressive over the century,
but it's within the bounds

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:58.970
that people talk about.

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:01.760
They talk about a meter,
meter and a 1/2, sometimes 2.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.580
So that's Bangladesh.

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.430
This if it comes out,
this is a picture

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:09.890
that I promised
you to talk about--

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.590
radiative forcing and methane
here versus carbon dioxide.

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:21.770
So this is a 2007 study that
looks at total contribution

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:29.150
to increased radiative
impact between 1750 and 2005.

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.200
You will see up here, CO2 has
a much bigger estimated effect

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.700
than methane.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:40.070
And the molecules last a lot
longer in the atmosphere.

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.950
So each methane molecule,
as Susan Solomon said,

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:44.930
is more powerful.

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.120
But half of these will
be gone in 10 years.

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.070
Whereas ballpark, half
of these will still

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:50.840
be around in a century.

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.940
So there are clear reasons for
focusing on carbon dioxide.

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.600
The halo carbons
are fluorocarbons,

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.800
chlorofluorocarbons
and the like.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.920
They are very powerful,
and they last a long time.

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.130
But they're not
greatly abundant.

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.310
And people are working
to phase them out.

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:14.750
Somebody mentioned black carbon.

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.040
There's a black carbon
impact via the reflectivity,

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.770
the albedo.

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:25.410
It does have a positive impact,
land use, negative impact

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.620
and so forth.

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.110
Aerosols are interesting.

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.290
This is like sulfur
dioxide put in the air

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.180
by coal-fired power plants.

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.390
That reflects, so
that tends to cool.

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.390
When Mount Pinatubo
blew in the Philippines,

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.750
there was I think about a
two degree impact on climate

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.660
from basically all that
dust reflecting sunlight.

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.940
So that's the best estimate.

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.260
It appears lots of places
of the cumulative impact

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.830
of human activity.

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:00.860
1750 is usually taken
as pre-industrial times,

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:02.780
kind of the benchmark.

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.290
Does this make some sense?

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.820
Are there questions about it?

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:09.770
OK, hearing none.

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:15.710
Today, I want to talk
about energy demand.

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:17.570
We'll also talk
about it Wednesday

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:21.720
but from a rather
different point of view.

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.780
I want to talk about
where it comes from,

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.720
the sort of short run,
long run difference.

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.840
How you might estimate
characteristics

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.820
of energy demand and then
stability and some puzzles.

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:39.180
So this is basically going to
be a walk through that teaching

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.410
note.

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:45.700
So it's fairly basic,
fairly basic stuff.

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:51.050
With very few exceptions,
there is no demand for energy.

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:53.870
There's a demand for
what energy does.

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:56.500
I mean you don't buy gasoline
to have it around the house.

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.060
Gasoline is nasty.

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:59.890
Vapors are explosive.

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:01.820
You buy it for what
you can do with it.

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:09.280
The demand for gasoline
is derived from what

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.220
it does, what it does for you.

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:17.740
And if you think about all the
things you use energy for, I

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:20.110
mean, you use it to heat food.

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:21.355
You use it to heat the house.

00:04:21.355 --> 00:04:22.690
You use it to cool.

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:25.300
You use it to make loud music.

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.738
Energy does a lot of things.

00:04:27.738 --> 00:04:30.280
You don't actually want to run
electricity through your body,

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.170
you want to use it to drive
speakers and so forth.

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:38.210
So the question is, if it's
that kind of a commodity,

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:40.060
how do we think
about it's demand?

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:42.380
Where does it come from?

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:48.400
It's clear that to produce any
energy service, heat, cooling,

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:52.150
transportation, it comes
with a bunch of inputs,

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:56.320
like any other product.

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.210
Transportation will
involve capital

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:00.370
in the form of some
kind of vehicle,

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:03.280
driving energy,
in this case, not

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.170
materials other than gasoline.

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:11.760
But well, maybe spare
parts, oil, and so forth.

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:12.980
So you start with that.

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:21.440
And I just make this
interesting point

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:26.060
that you normally
think of inputs

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:27.590
into production as substitutes.

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:31.610
So if capital gets more
expensive, you use more labor.

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:33.150
You switch from
capital to labor.

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:34.820
Well, capital and
energy has turned out

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:37.430
in a number of studies
to be complements,

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:38.780
which is pretty rare.

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:40.700
If you raise the
price of energy,

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:42.230
you reduce the
demand for energy.

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:44.360
You reduce the
demand for capital

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:47.780
used in production as well, OK.

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:53.240
I will talk about this last
point in a minute, the progress

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:56.000
in these production functions.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.270
Clear so far?

00:05:58.270 --> 00:05:58.770
Yeah.

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:00.150
AUDIENCE: Sorry, what example?

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:02.120
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Materials.

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:05.180
That's just a general form
of a production function.

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:10.770
If you want to
produce cooked food,

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:14.610
you need some piece
of capital to contain

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:18.280
the heat, some source of
heat, your cooking time,

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:19.990
and of course, the ingredients.

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:21.390
So that would be
an example where

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:26.610
it would be important, OK?

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:28.680
This is just some indication.

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:32.760
There's a Nordhaus paper I
think I cited in the note that

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:37.830
looks at the cost of lighting.

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:42.270
Cents per 1,000 lumens
from 1800 to today.

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:43.878
And it's dramatic.

00:06:43.878 --> 00:06:45.420
You can actually do
light because you

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:47.640
can look at the output of
various lighting devices.

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:50.410
You're doing whale oil
up here and so forth.

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:53.070
And it does get a little flat.

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:55.350
Once you get the fluorescent
bulbs, it gets flat.

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:58.020
And we're down here beginning
to think about LEDs.

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:02.370
But it's also true
in automobiles.

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:08.565
I don't have the slide, but
2.6% of the year advance

00:07:08.565 --> 00:07:12.840
in automotive technology
estimated by my colleague,

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:16.590
Chris Knittel, means that--

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:20.530
well, here's one example
of what it means.

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:23.530
If you kept all the
other characteristics

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:26.350
of an automobile at
1980 levels, we'd

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:29.380
have a 50% increase
in miles per gallon,

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:34.300
or decrease in gallons per
mile between 1980 and 2006.

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:35.950
In fact, we didn't.

00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:40.430
Mileage was pretty stable and
all these things increased.

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:44.180
But 2.6% a year is a
pretty dramatic increase

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:49.980
in the advance of a
very mature technology.

00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:52.410
And you see this in a lot
of energy using technology.

00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:57.000
Power plants have
this lighting, motors,

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.920
lots of energy
using technologies,

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:02.640
air conditioners have
this kind of progress

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:08.850
that energy per unit of
output has fallen dramatically

00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:10.650
historically.

00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:15.990
All right, so let me do a
little bit of characteristics

00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:18.000
of derived demand.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.510
Because when you think about
energy, energy demand, you do

00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:24.290
need to kind think about
it as derived demand.

00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:27.000
So let's suppose
capital is fixed.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.400
It's the short run.

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:33.230
I'm going to just lay
this out for the moment.

00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:38.908
Yep, so we want to drive
the demand for gasoline.

00:08:38.908 --> 00:08:40.450
We want to think
about where it comes

00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:48.110
from, or the demand for gas to
dry clothes, or to cook food.

00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:51.920
There is sort of two
functions involved.

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:55.000
The first is some demand
function for the service.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.240
What am I willing to pay
to have my condo cool?

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:03.430
That's going to depend on
the cost of cooling it,

00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:06.460
other prices, how wealthy
I am, capital stock

00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:08.170
tastes, all kinds of things.

00:09:08.170 --> 00:09:14.320
But I'm going to focus on
the relation between how

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:17.350
cool I keep it, my
demand for cooling,

00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:20.440
and what does it
cost me to cool?

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:25.410
What it costs me to cool comes
out of how I produce cooling.

00:09:25.410 --> 00:09:29.270
There's some production function
determined by my very old air

00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:32.900
conditioner that I'll
get cooling services.

00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:35.330
It will depend on, well, in
this case not particularly

00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:36.380
materials or labor.

00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:39.890
It's just going to depend on
how much electricity I use.

00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:44.630
So in the case of cooling,
this function gets simple.

00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:46.910
The cooling, however
we measure it

00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:49.070
is going to be a function
of how much energy,

00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:51.020
how much electricity I use.

00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:51.980
We could get fancy.

00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:54.030
It will depend on when
I use it and so forth.

00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:57.650
But as a simple story,
that's a pretty good story.

00:09:57.650 --> 00:10:03.510
So if what I'm interested in
is the demand for electricity

00:10:03.510 --> 00:10:10.770
as a function of its
price, then somehow I

00:10:10.770 --> 00:10:13.980
don't have a price
for cooling, right?

00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:14.550
I don't pay.

00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:16.380
I don't get a bill
to cool my apartment.

00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:19.060
I get a bill for electricity.

00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:22.110
So if I want to get a
demand for electricity

00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:25.980
as a function of its
price, I need these.

00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:29.170
I need this function.

00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:30.850
How much do I care
about cooling?

00:10:30.850 --> 00:10:33.940
And this function,
how do I get cooling?

00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:37.580
And then obviously, something
about the price of electricity.

00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:41.530
So I'll tell you how
you do it in general,

00:10:41.530 --> 00:10:43.210
and then we'll walk
through an example.

00:10:43.210 --> 00:10:47.020
And there's some
stuff in the notes.

00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:50.830
So if I've got all the
prices, conceptually I

00:10:50.830 --> 00:10:55.110
say, well, what's the best
way to produce cooling?

00:10:55.110 --> 00:11:03.450
That is a function of
prices, prices of the way

00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:04.740
down here rather.

00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:08.250
If I know the prices of energy,
the price of anything else I

00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:12.600
use, I can say, what's
the cost of cooling

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:15.450
as a function of various prices?

00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:17.730
Then I can substitute
the cost of cooling,

00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:22.770
the price of the service
up here and get the demand.

00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:24.970
That's impossible to follow.

00:11:24.970 --> 00:11:25.470
Am I right?

00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:27.810
OK.

00:11:27.810 --> 00:11:31.530
You'll come back to
it after the example.

00:11:31.530 --> 00:11:36.460
So let's do lighting with
two very simple functions.

00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:41.200
Suppose up here is my
demand for lighting.

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:45.240
So lumen hours,
which I'm just going

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:47.640
to call lumens to keep my
slides a little shorter,

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:49.770
my bullet's a little shorter.

00:11:49.770 --> 00:11:52.350
Lumen hours, this is my demand.

00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:55.020
If this is the cost
per lumen hour,

00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:58.230
then with A and B as
constants, then this

00:11:58.230 --> 00:11:59.670
is my demand per lumen hour.

00:11:59.670 --> 00:12:03.360
It's a straightforward
demand curve.

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:06.030
B is the price elasticity.

00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:10.020
You may remember that from
first economics course.

00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:12.570
It's the ratio of
percentage changes.

00:12:12.570 --> 00:12:16.990
Limiting ratio is
the changes go to 0,

00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:23.290
the percentage change in demand
induced by a 1% change in cost,

00:12:23.290 --> 00:12:27.400
or an epsilon change
in cost, the ratio.

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:30.610
We use elasticities a lot in
economics just as a reminder

00:12:30.610 --> 00:12:33.350
because they are unit free.

00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:36.080
There's no natural units here.

00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:39.800
So you could measure price in
pennies or dollars or euros

00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:41.580
or whatever else.

00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:47.150
So you don't want to say the
notion of change per dollar

00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:50.150
doesn't have any particular
intrinsic meaning.

00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:55.430
The notion of percentage change
from a 1% increase in cost

00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:57.720
is usually a little
more convenient.

00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:01.970
So let me suppose that's my
demand curve for lighting.

00:13:01.970 --> 00:13:04.410
And let me suppose
it's the short run.

00:13:04.410 --> 00:13:11.570
So again, the more electricity
I use, the more lighting I get.

00:13:11.570 --> 00:13:14.363
And e is just some constant.

00:13:14.363 --> 00:13:15.780
So now what I want
to know, I want

00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:20.890
to get my demand for
electricity for lighting, right?

00:13:20.890 --> 00:13:22.330
It's a derived demand.

00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:24.100
I don't care about electricity.

00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:29.230
I care about lighting,
about L. I use electricity

00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:31.000
to produce it.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.360
The demand for lighting
is derived from the demand

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:37.360
for electricity.

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:39.890
So how do I do it?

00:13:39.890 --> 00:13:46.850
OK, in this simple case, if
I've got a price of electricity,

00:13:46.850 --> 00:13:51.740
say dollars per kilowatt
hour, I could easily

00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:58.440
solve with this thing
for a price per lumen.

00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:00.050
I know what electricity costs.

00:14:00.050 --> 00:14:03.050
I know the relation between
electricity and lumens,

00:14:03.050 --> 00:14:03.950
it's linear.

00:14:03.950 --> 00:14:08.630
So I know the price,
lumen hours, but lumens.

00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:14.220
So just to get
the unit straight,

00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:17.010
the units of this
little constant e

00:14:17.010 --> 00:14:22.720
has to be lumen hours
per kilowatt hour, right?

00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:26.150
And I want a price per lumen.

00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:30.500
So I get $1 per lumen price by
dividing the per kilowatt hour

00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:33.580
price by lumens
per kilowatt hour.

00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:40.710
So I've now got the
cost per lumen hour, OK?

00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:42.660
With me so far?

00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:44.802
Scream and shout if not.

00:14:44.802 --> 00:14:48.380
Well, don't scream, but
a shout would be good.

00:14:48.380 --> 00:14:49.890
I can substitute then.

00:14:49.890 --> 00:14:57.000
I know that the
amount of lumens I get

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.780
is this little constant e times
the amount of electricity.

00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:11.130
The demand curve then
is A times the dollars

00:15:11.130 --> 00:15:13.620
per lumen to the minus
B. That's dollars

00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:17.490
per lumen, PE over little e.

00:15:17.490 --> 00:15:20.730
Solve for electricity, and I
have the demand for electricity

00:15:20.730 --> 00:15:25.585
as a function of its price, OK?

00:15:28.690 --> 00:15:31.430
Walk one more time.

00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:35.620
I care about lighting
as a function

00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:38.600
of the cost of lighting.

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:40.460
I don't care about electricity.

00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:42.980
I care about lighting as
a function of its cost.

00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:51.720
What I want to do
first is get the cost.

00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:56.400
And in this case, because it's
the short run and very simple,

00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:58.110
all the bulbs are fixed.

00:15:58.110 --> 00:16:02.280
It's just proportional to
how much electricity I use.

00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:08.630
So the cost-- you can think of
e as relating to efficiency.

00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:11.130
You increase little
e, basically,

00:16:11.130 --> 00:16:16.110
I've got more
efficient bulbs, which

00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:17.790
is another way to get quickly.

00:16:17.790 --> 00:16:21.130
I do it with units because
otherwise I get backwards.

00:16:21.130 --> 00:16:28.540
But the larger is this
efficiency parameter little

00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:34.350
e given the electricity price,
the cheaper is lighting, right?

00:16:34.350 --> 00:16:37.890
So it's another way
to think about it.

00:16:37.890 --> 00:16:42.610
Once I have the
cost of lighting,

00:16:42.610 --> 00:16:46.280
I can substitute into
the demand function.

00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:50.570
Note that here is the
production function.

00:16:50.570 --> 00:16:55.740
Take this second to
quality and solve.

00:16:55.740 --> 00:16:57.690
And I get the demand
for electricity

00:16:57.690 --> 00:17:00.060
is a function of the
price of electricity

00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:01.770
and the efficiency of lighting.

00:17:06.819 --> 00:17:13.990
Question, is this easy?

00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:14.589
Hard?

00:17:14.589 --> 00:17:15.339
Confusing?

00:17:15.339 --> 00:17:16.130
Backwards?

00:17:16.130 --> 00:17:18.880
Upside down?

00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:19.900
Will it be on the quiz?

00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:20.589
Yeah, probably.

00:17:20.589 --> 00:17:21.790
Yeah, something like it.

00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:22.290
Yeah.

00:17:26.470 --> 00:17:28.757
Julian, Julian,
you had a question?

00:17:28.757 --> 00:17:30.715
AUDIENCE: Oh, no, I was
giving you a thumbs up.

00:17:30.715 --> 00:17:33.280
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: You
give me a thumbs up, OK.

00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:35.020
This is a rare and
wonderful experience.

00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:38.170
Let me just treasure
this for a moment.

00:17:38.170 --> 00:17:41.900
Does anybody have an alternative
reaction of any kind.

00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:43.660
OK, all right, I move on.

00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:49.210
A couple of comments about this.

00:17:52.292 --> 00:17:53.375
Think about that function.

00:17:58.850 --> 00:18:02.810
You know, I really should
have put it on this slide.

00:18:02.810 --> 00:18:06.260
You notice a couple of things.

00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:09.230
You'll notice that the
elasticity of demand

00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:12.950
for electricity turns out to
be the same as the elasticity

00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:15.040
of demand for lighting.

00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:18.210
That is not a general property.

00:18:18.210 --> 00:18:19.560
It can be greater or less.

00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:20.790
It's not a general property.

00:18:23.330 --> 00:18:31.110
You will also notice
that what happens

00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:33.960
to the demand for electricity
when efficiency increases

00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:45.210
depend on that parameter B. So
that if B is greater than 1,

00:18:45.210 --> 00:18:49.110
then making my light
bulbs more efficient

00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:54.680
will increase my use
of electricity, right?

00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:57.950
Because B greater than 1
means my demand for lighting

00:18:57.950 --> 00:19:01.210
is really price sensitive.

00:19:01.210 --> 00:19:06.340
And if you've made
lights more efficient,

00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:09.640
you've reduced the
cost of lighting.

00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:12.130
And since my demand for
lighting is price sensitive,

00:19:12.130 --> 00:19:13.450
you make lights more efficient.

00:19:13.450 --> 00:19:16.650
I use more lighting, OK.

00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:24.170
Those are basically
the two comments.

00:19:24.170 --> 00:19:28.030
The first is that
relationship, it's

00:19:28.030 --> 00:19:31.770
kind of a function
of this example.

00:19:31.770 --> 00:19:37.220
The second comes up in
debates about auto efficiency

00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:39.590
standards.

00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:42.200
Because it makes
sense, if I impose

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:45.760
a miles per gallon
standard on cars,

00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:51.040
I have made driving
less expensive.

00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:56.560
And if driving is
really price sensitive,

00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:59.815
that could on balance increase
the demand for gasoline.

00:20:02.610 --> 00:20:05.040
Now, this gets debated.

00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:07.070
This is called
the rebound effect

00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:12.420
in talking about CAFE standards,
auto fuel efficiency standards.

00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:19.380
Most estimates say
that it happens.

00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:23.750
But as far as CAFE standards
are concerned, in effect,

00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:24.653
B is less than 1.

00:20:24.653 --> 00:20:25.820
The rebound effect is small.

00:20:25.820 --> 00:20:27.000
But it's there.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.260
Estimates show it to be
there because driving

00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:32.180
is price sensitive.

00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:34.340
Price of gasoline goes
up, people drive less.

00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:36.830
Cars get cheaper to
drive, people drive more.

00:20:36.830 --> 00:20:39.680
Not a big effect, not a
huge effect, but it's there.

00:20:42.330 --> 00:20:43.290
OK so far?

00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:48.970
Very quiet today, OK.

00:20:52.090 --> 00:20:55.010
All the enthusiasm went
into negotiations then, OK.

00:20:58.060 --> 00:21:01.450
Obviously price isn't the
only thing that matters.

00:21:01.450 --> 00:21:04.530
I find a very interesting graph.

00:21:04.530 --> 00:21:08.310
This is passenger kilometers
traveled per capita

00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:09.570
on the vertical axis.

00:21:09.570 --> 00:21:12.150
It's a log, log scale.

00:21:12.150 --> 00:21:15.930
And GDP per capita
on the horizontal

00:21:15.930 --> 00:21:19.320
axis, you will notice that
the relation looks linear.

00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:22.140
What you can't see
is that this is

00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:25.710
a scatter that includes all
kinds of different countries,

00:21:25.710 --> 00:21:34.380
sub-Saharan Africa, Latin
America, North America.

00:21:34.380 --> 00:21:38.140
The universe is somewhere
in this scatter over time.

00:21:38.140 --> 00:21:41.730
So this is probably
North America.

00:21:41.730 --> 00:21:44.790
It points to a relatively
constant elasticity.

00:21:44.790 --> 00:21:48.040
That's not driven,
that's traveled.

00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:53.680
So you get airplanes at
the top, and so forth.

00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:56.440
There is this law, and I don't
remember the parameter that

00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:59.920
says you spend x%
your time traveling,

00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:03.850
whether you're a poor person
walking or a rich person

00:22:03.850 --> 00:22:06.340
flying, the travel
percentage turns out

00:22:06.340 --> 00:22:08.560
to not vary much with income.

00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:10.565
That's a big income effect.

00:22:10.565 --> 00:22:11.440
Let me just say that.

00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:14.530
That's an income elasticity
floating around 1,

00:22:14.530 --> 00:22:17.110
double income, double
vehicle miles traveled.

00:22:17.110 --> 00:22:19.660
It doesn't necessarily
mean double gasoline,

00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:22.030
doubling anything else,
people travel other ways.

00:22:22.030 --> 00:22:27.760
But income affects energy
demand, obviously, a lot.

00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:29.260
What about the long run?

00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:37.960
Well, when I talked about
the demand for lighting

00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:43.770
or the demand for
driving or anything else,

00:22:43.770 --> 00:22:49.120
in that simple example, or
in the example in the note,

00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:52.330
you hold the
capital stock fixed.

00:22:52.330 --> 00:22:54.430
In the longer run,
and here gasoline

00:22:54.430 --> 00:23:00.770
is the thing to think
about, I'll change my car.

00:23:00.770 --> 00:23:04.163
So in the short run,
price of gasoline moves.

00:23:04.163 --> 00:23:05.330
Maybe I drive a little more.

00:23:05.330 --> 00:23:07.810
Maybe I drive a little less.

00:23:07.810 --> 00:23:13.490
Price of gasoline goes up by a
multiple of 5 and stays there,

00:23:13.490 --> 00:23:15.960
let's say.

00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:18.870
I probably would change my car.

00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:22.080
I might want to consider
changing where I live.

00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:24.900
I might want to rethink my
use of public transportation.

00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:27.720
I can do a lot of things
in the longer run.

00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:31.140
I can certainly change my car
and think about where I live.

00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:35.220
Do I really want to live in
Weston as opposed to-- oh,

00:23:35.220 --> 00:23:36.120
you're not from here.

00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:39.810
Do I really want to live
way out in the suburbs

00:23:39.810 --> 00:23:41.490
if gasoline is really expensive.

00:23:41.490 --> 00:23:45.820
Or do I want to think
about moving into town.

00:23:45.820 --> 00:23:49.660
And if I'm locating a factory,
and I'm thinking about,

00:23:49.660 --> 00:23:55.390
do workers like to drive very
far, or an office building,

00:23:55.390 --> 00:23:57.500
I have to rethink
where to put it.

00:23:57.500 --> 00:24:02.740
So in the longer run,
you expect more change.

00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:06.160
You expect whatever the
response to an energy price

00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:09.640
changes in the
short run, bip, bip,

00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:12.820
bip, you expect if
it's maintained,

00:24:12.820 --> 00:24:14.380
the response will be longer.

00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:15.880
That will be larger.

00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:19.040
And I will come back to this.

00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:20.830
This is sort of a
basic principle.

00:24:20.830 --> 00:24:24.280
Paul Samuelson was the
first to really lay it out.

00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:27.310
You have more flexibility in
the long run, more things,

00:24:27.310 --> 00:24:29.380
more degrees of freedom.

00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:31.960
You expect a greater
response to almost anything,

00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:33.880
income change, price
change, whatever,

00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:35.980
if it's maintained over time.

00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:38.260
You expect the response
to grow to a change that's

00:24:38.260 --> 00:24:39.370
maintained over time.

00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:45.990
Part of that is because
of the long-lived capital.

00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:53.410
But you will also recall that
we talked about all kinds

00:24:53.410 --> 00:24:55.670
of path-dependent reasons.

00:24:55.670 --> 00:24:58.510
So let me just slip
outside economics for just

00:24:58.510 --> 00:25:04.050
a slight moment and say that
for the pure economic side, one

00:25:04.050 --> 00:25:07.350
reason why the long
run response is greater

00:25:07.350 --> 00:25:10.200
than the short run response
is because you change capital

00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:11.040
stock.

00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:15.210
And you don't change
capital stock quickly.

00:25:15.210 --> 00:25:17.850
At the societal
level, the things

00:25:17.850 --> 00:25:22.740
that affect response may
be policies, may be habits,

00:25:22.740 --> 00:25:24.540
may be culture.

00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:27.390
And they change very quickly.

00:25:27.390 --> 00:25:29.580
For Boston to look
like Copenhagen

00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:32.630
as far as bicycle
usage is concerned

00:25:32.630 --> 00:25:36.390
would not be easy or quick.

00:25:36.390 --> 00:25:38.160
They're having ferocious
debates about how

00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:42.330
to set up the Longfellow bridge
for bicycles versus cars.

00:25:42.330 --> 00:25:47.500
And that bridge hasn't been
reconfigured in 100 years.

00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:51.620
It will now have, I think, more
bicycle space going forward.

00:25:51.620 --> 00:25:53.253
And if you've biked
across that bridge,

00:25:53.253 --> 00:25:54.670
you will think
that's a good thing

00:25:54.670 --> 00:25:56.660
because it's a little tricky--

00:25:56.660 --> 00:25:59.720
so long run, short run.

00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:04.340
So let me now talk about how
you estimate these things.

00:26:04.340 --> 00:26:05.420
So that's theory.

00:26:08.870 --> 00:26:11.300
I'm a rational
calculator, I'm Walmart,

00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:14.360
and I want to know my
demand for electricity

00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:15.620
for heating and cooling.

00:26:15.620 --> 00:26:16.975
I don't care about electricity.

00:26:16.975 --> 00:26:18.350
I care about
heating and cooling.

00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:21.500
I want to think through how
my demand for electricity

00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:25.490
will be reflected by
changes in the price.

00:26:25.490 --> 00:26:27.410
And I will look at my
production function,

00:26:27.410 --> 00:26:29.540
the HVAC system I've got.

00:26:29.540 --> 00:26:31.610
And I'll look at
my demand function,

00:26:31.610 --> 00:26:34.160
how much do I care
about store temperature

00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:39.470
and figure out what I want to
do in terms of electricity.

00:26:39.470 --> 00:26:41.150
And then in the
longer run, depending

00:26:41.150 --> 00:26:44.240
on the cost of electricity,
I will insulate more or less.

00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:46.450
I will design stores
in different ways.

00:26:46.450 --> 00:26:49.560
I have all kinds of
response options.

00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:53.720
So that's terrific for
the decision maker.

00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:59.042
Suppose you want to estimate
the demand for electricity,

00:26:59.042 --> 00:27:00.500
the demand for
gasoline or anything

00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:03.260
else by looking at the market.

00:27:03.260 --> 00:27:04.280
You're a seller.

00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:05.540
You're a policymaker.

00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:07.610
You care about what
all of that stuff

00:27:07.610 --> 00:27:10.880
ends up looking like at
the end of the day when

00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:12.890
all the decisions shake out.

00:27:12.890 --> 00:27:18.610
So a natural thing to
do is to look at data.

00:27:18.610 --> 00:27:23.888
The first place this was
done was in agriculture.

00:27:23.888 --> 00:27:25.430
People said well,
you know, we'd like

00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:27.200
to know what the demand
curve for wheat looks like,

00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:28.700
what the demand
curve for corn looks

00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:31.220
like for planning purposes.

00:27:31.220 --> 00:27:33.140
If you've seen the
Department of Agriculture

00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:35.240
building in Washington,
it was for a long time

00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:38.060
the largest building
in the world.

00:27:38.060 --> 00:27:42.180
We spend a lot of effort
studying agricultural markets.

00:27:42.180 --> 00:27:44.840
And when they
first did this they

00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:47.900
found demand curves
that sloped up.

00:27:47.900 --> 00:27:50.030
They graphed price, and
they graphed quantity,

00:27:50.030 --> 00:27:52.890
and they got demand
curves sloping up.

00:27:52.890 --> 00:27:53.970
This was disturbing.

00:27:53.970 --> 00:27:54.920
How could that happen.

00:28:01.450 --> 00:28:02.937
Yes, Marie.

00:28:02.937 --> 00:28:04.520
AUDIENCE: Well, the
demand curve could

00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:05.930
shift with the supply curve.

00:28:05.930 --> 00:28:09.068
And if they shift more
easily, you might a bad--

00:28:09.068 --> 00:28:11.485
your data is not going to
follow the trend of specifically

00:28:11.485 --> 00:28:13.660
the demand curve.

00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:15.490
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: OK, close.

00:28:15.490 --> 00:28:17.560
You're saying that
the data are going

00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:20.140
to be affected by the supply
curve as well as the demand

00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:21.170
curve.

00:28:21.170 --> 00:28:24.777
In fact, suppose the supply
curve doesn't shift at all.

00:28:24.777 --> 00:28:25.860
What are you going to get?

00:28:28.208 --> 00:28:30.500
AUDIENCE: If the supply curve
doesn't shift at all then

00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:33.370
you're going to get
every change in--

00:28:33.370 --> 00:28:35.470
like the equilibrium
point is going

00:28:35.470 --> 00:28:38.145
to be a point along
the demand curve.

00:28:38.145 --> 00:28:39.520
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Think again.

00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:42.320
The supply curve doesn't shift,
the demand curve does shift.

00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:43.240
What do you get?

00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:44.470
AUDIENCE: You are going to
trace out the supply curve.

00:28:44.470 --> 00:28:44.590
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
You're going

00:28:44.590 --> 00:28:46.423
to trace out the supply
curve, which is what

00:28:46.423 --> 00:28:47.740
David was dying to say, right?

00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:49.240
Am I right?

00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:51.190
OK.

00:28:51.190 --> 00:28:54.550
We're going to
move to thumbs, OK?

00:28:54.550 --> 00:28:59.760
The classic picture, the classic
picture, so you have what's

00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:01.770
come to be called an
Identification problem.

00:29:01.770 --> 00:29:07.940
How do you figure out,
how do you get to demand?

00:29:07.940 --> 00:29:10.730
I care about demand.

00:29:10.730 --> 00:29:11.783
I'm not getting demand.

00:29:11.783 --> 00:29:12.575
I'm getting supply.

00:29:15.630 --> 00:29:18.300
And in fact, if
that's the world,

00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:20.460
if all I know were
price and quantity,

00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:22.530
and all I know is the
demand curve shifts

00:29:22.530 --> 00:29:26.520
and the supply curve doesn't,
I can't estimate demand.

00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:28.870
That's to say, it's
not identified.

00:29:28.870 --> 00:29:32.820
I could gather all the data in
the world from that setting.

00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:37.020
And I could not learn
about demand from the data.

00:29:37.020 --> 00:29:39.580
Demand curve is not identified.

00:29:39.580 --> 00:29:42.385
So what you need--

00:29:45.930 --> 00:29:47.520
and Marie was on to it.

00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:52.250
What you need is you've got
to move the supply curve.

00:29:52.250 --> 00:29:55.257
There has to be something
that affects supply.

00:29:55.257 --> 00:29:57.090
If you've got something
that affects supply,

00:29:57.090 --> 00:29:59.298
and you've got something
that affects demand and they

00:29:59.298 --> 00:30:01.142
both move around,
then if you work

00:30:01.142 --> 00:30:02.850
through the example
in the teaching note,

00:30:02.850 --> 00:30:05.970
you can, in principle
estimate both of them.

00:30:08.780 --> 00:30:10.560
There are nice techniques.

00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:11.780
This is a lot of fun.

00:30:11.780 --> 00:30:15.290
But I mention this not
because this course

00:30:15.290 --> 00:30:19.010
is about learning these
techniques, which it's not,

00:30:19.010 --> 00:30:23.960
but it is about being skeptical
when people tell you, well, we

00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:25.580
plotted price and
quantity and we

00:30:25.580 --> 00:30:27.910
got-- here's our demand curve.

00:30:27.910 --> 00:30:33.910
Whenever you're dealing with
a demand supply situation,

00:30:33.910 --> 00:30:36.850
you have to ask, how do you
know that you're actually

00:30:36.850 --> 00:30:40.640
getting demand not
supply not some mixture?

00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:41.140
Right?

00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:43.690
You can have both demand
and supply shifting,

00:30:43.690 --> 00:30:46.560
and you could get
a scatter of points

00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:50.260
that slopes down or is flat.

00:30:50.260 --> 00:30:52.720
You could say, well, you know,
demand is very price elastic

00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:54.130
because the scatter shows this.

00:30:54.130 --> 00:30:56.910
Well, it doesn't.

00:30:56.910 --> 00:31:00.060
This is just a caution.

00:31:00.060 --> 00:31:03.210
Because you will
see in your life,

00:31:03.210 --> 00:31:05.310
I expect, with
reasonable probability,

00:31:05.310 --> 00:31:08.680
estimates of the demand for
this and the demand for that.

00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:12.270
And question one, is how do
you know you've got demand?

00:31:12.270 --> 00:31:15.978
What did you do to deal with
this identification problem?

00:31:15.978 --> 00:31:17.520
What did you do to
deal with the fact

00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:22.380
that demand and supply are
simultaneously determined?

00:31:22.380 --> 00:31:33.520
OK, clear, simple,
classic stuff, OK.

00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:44.920
Now, I talked about the
long run and the short run.

00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:47.610
So how do we do
that in practice?

00:31:47.610 --> 00:31:56.310
Well, there's a simple way
that's pretty commonly used.

00:31:56.310 --> 00:32:00.040
And it's called a
partial adjustment model.

00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:04.440
And the equation let's say,
E is the demand for energy.

00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:06.190
And here all the things
that determine it.

00:32:06.190 --> 00:32:08.320
E star is a function.

00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:12.040
E star is considered to be
the long run demand function.

00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:16.910
And lambda is a constant
between 0 and 1, OK?

00:32:16.910 --> 00:32:18.800
So this is a common formulation.

00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:23.780
If you think about it and
you fiddled with difference

00:32:23.780 --> 00:32:27.680
equations, or you
can just substitute,

00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:29.600
suppose E star is constant.

00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:33.170
Suppose the demand
for energy is constant

00:32:33.170 --> 00:32:35.480
because the prices and
other things have changed,

00:32:35.480 --> 00:32:38.790
and they've changed permanently.

00:32:38.790 --> 00:32:44.260
Then E is going to
converge to E star.

00:32:44.260 --> 00:32:50.020
Again, you just start out at
some E0 and just substitute.

00:32:50.020 --> 00:32:53.380
And you will see that if
lambda is less than 1,

00:32:53.380 --> 00:32:58.560
the initial condition goes away
and it converges to E star.

00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:00.520
So this is a model.

00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:09.330
But in the short run, in the
short run, the change in demand

00:33:09.330 --> 00:33:13.670
will be reduced by this
multiple lambda, right?

00:33:13.670 --> 00:33:21.850
So suppose doubling
income doubles E star.

00:33:21.850 --> 00:33:24.790
OK, that's the
long run response.

00:33:24.790 --> 00:33:33.630
If lambda is 0.5, then
doubling income today

00:33:33.630 --> 00:33:42.010
will by itself only increase
energy by 50% of E star, right?

00:33:42.010 --> 00:33:44.520
So it's a smoothing.

00:33:44.520 --> 00:33:46.890
You could think about this
as smoothing as signal

00:33:46.890 --> 00:33:48.750
detection is whatever you like.

00:33:48.750 --> 00:33:51.240
But the effective
lambda less than 1

00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:53.040
is that the response
in the short run

00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:54.870
is less than the
response in the long run.

00:33:58.610 --> 00:34:00.265
So you estimate that.

00:34:03.420 --> 00:34:05.860
You assume a function
that involves everything

00:34:05.860 --> 00:34:07.330
else you can think of.

00:34:07.330 --> 00:34:09.850
You use some technique
to deal with the fact

00:34:09.850 --> 00:34:14.110
that price is determined along
with quantity, along with E

00:34:14.110 --> 00:34:19.190
and estimate a function of that
form, pretty commonly done,

00:34:19.190 --> 00:34:22.100
pretty commonly done.

00:34:22.100 --> 00:34:24.830
I'm going to give you some
actual estimates in a minute.

00:34:24.830 --> 00:34:29.489
They tend to come from a
framework like that where you

00:34:29.489 --> 00:34:33.840
say, it's a simple way of
saying if a change is maintained

00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:35.969
over time, the response
will be greater

00:34:35.969 --> 00:34:40.670
than if the change happens today
and gets reversed tomorrow.

00:34:40.670 --> 00:34:46.989
It has that property for
lambda between 0 and 1, OK?

00:34:50.810 --> 00:34:53.940
Yeah, that's all
straightforward.

00:34:53.940 --> 00:34:56.380
You can recover so to speak.

00:34:59.150 --> 00:35:01.520
You estimate a
function like this

00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:04.260
that has lagged demand
on the right as well.

00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:10.190
Its coefficient is an
estimate of 1 minus lambda.

00:35:10.190 --> 00:35:11.840
That lets you recover lambda.

00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:15.860
That lets you get the
long run function, right?

00:35:15.860 --> 00:35:18.430
So if I want to know what
the long run response is,

00:35:18.430 --> 00:35:22.550
I look at the lag
dependent variable.

00:35:22.550 --> 00:35:26.890
And again, if you
think about it,

00:35:26.890 --> 00:35:30.290
suppose this coefficient is 0.9.

00:35:30.290 --> 00:35:32.690
That means all else
equal, E is going

00:35:32.690 --> 00:35:36.140
to tend to be pretty
smooth, right?

00:35:36.140 --> 00:35:39.470
The changes in E star are
going to be highly damp.

00:35:39.470 --> 00:35:40.910
This will be 0.1.

00:35:40.910 --> 00:35:43.055
And E itself is going
to be pretty smooth.

00:35:45.710 --> 00:35:48.770
But I can sort of undo
that by saying, all right,

00:35:48.770 --> 00:35:52.670
I'll divide by 0.1
over here and get

00:35:52.670 --> 00:35:57.560
an estimate of the function
that would govern response

00:35:57.560 --> 00:36:03.870
to permanent changes, OK?

00:36:03.870 --> 00:36:05.430
There are other approaches.

00:36:05.430 --> 00:36:10.290
There's a note, the note cites
this very interesting paper

00:36:10.290 --> 00:36:14.640
by Hill Huntington that
looks at oil price changes.

00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:17.490
He notes that the price
of oil at any time

00:36:17.490 --> 00:36:21.630
is equal to the sum of the
maximum it's ever been.

00:36:21.630 --> 00:36:23.740
And the difference
between what it is today

00:36:23.740 --> 00:36:25.410
and the maximum it's ever been.

00:36:25.410 --> 00:36:27.960
He puts both of these
into an equation

00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:32.160
and finds that the maximum has
the largest negative effect

00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:35.430
on demand for gasoline.

00:36:35.430 --> 00:36:38.430
In his argument--
so it's not this.

00:36:38.430 --> 00:36:40.560
It's a different
adjustment mechanism.

00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:44.718
He says people get a
sense of what kind of cars

00:36:44.718 --> 00:36:46.260
they ought to have
and how they ought

00:36:46.260 --> 00:36:49.950
to heat their houses based on
how high oil or gasoline has

00:36:49.950 --> 00:36:51.890
been.

00:36:51.890 --> 00:36:56.780
So the previous maximum has
a very powerful shock impact.

00:36:56.780 --> 00:37:00.200
We do remember gasoline
prices over $4 a gallon.

00:37:00.200 --> 00:37:04.430
You may be able to say what
it is right now, I can't.

00:37:04.430 --> 00:37:09.320
So P max the argument
is has a large effect.

00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:10.670
I'm not sure that's right.

00:37:10.670 --> 00:37:13.460
I haven't seen any other study
that tested that effectively

00:37:13.460 --> 00:37:14.990
or that reproduced it.

00:37:14.990 --> 00:37:19.010
But it it's an
interesting approach.

00:37:19.010 --> 00:37:22.810
Most of the time,
again, the intuition,

00:37:22.810 --> 00:37:25.030
because all this
stuff is durable,

00:37:25.030 --> 00:37:32.005
all these assets are durable,
changes take a long time, OK.

00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:40.710
Some results, this is
something that people

00:37:40.710 --> 00:37:46.800
have studied a lot, the demand
for various forms of energy.

00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:51.530
And I will have
assigned a paper or two.

00:37:51.530 --> 00:37:55.790
But they all go properly
into the deep weeds,

00:37:55.790 --> 00:37:57.840
technically, and
in terms of data.

00:37:57.840 --> 00:38:01.100
So I'm just going to
give you a summary.

00:38:01.100 --> 00:38:04.010
The first summary
point is the difference

00:38:04.010 --> 00:38:07.410
is normally huge between the
short run and the long run.

00:38:07.410 --> 00:38:10.220
So to go back to that
other formulation,

00:38:10.220 --> 00:38:14.240
it's as if lambda
is generally quite

00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:19.390
small in models like that,
estimated to be quite small.

00:38:23.630 --> 00:38:29.280
Second, short run income and
price elasticity, say a year,

00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:31.950
is generally less than 0.5.

00:38:31.950 --> 00:38:37.340
So if you double price,
you will reduce consumption

00:38:37.340 --> 00:38:39.680
by less than half.

00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:44.180
I mean generally, you
will see a good deal less,

00:38:44.180 --> 00:38:46.730
double income price
consumption will

00:38:46.730 --> 00:38:48.800
increase by less than half.

00:38:54.450 --> 00:38:56.970
The results seem to
depend on the economy,

00:38:56.970 --> 00:38:59.070
rich countries, poor countries.

00:38:59.070 --> 00:39:01.290
That might make
some sense, density.

00:39:01.290 --> 00:39:02.790
You can think of
all kinds of things

00:39:02.790 --> 00:39:04.860
that might affect
how people respond

00:39:04.860 --> 00:39:07.050
to changes in price and income.

00:39:07.050 --> 00:39:13.170
A lot of the studies have been
of gasoline and electricity.

00:39:13.170 --> 00:39:17.010
And here's some of the
ranges for elasticities.

00:39:19.610 --> 00:39:23.120
Income elasticity is
the percentage increase

00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:25.760
in demand by 1%--

00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:29.040
small 1%-- increase in income.

00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:32.420
So income elasticity of 1
means if I double your income,

00:39:32.420 --> 00:39:35.590
you double your demand.

00:39:35.590 --> 00:39:38.470
The short run elasticities
for gasoline--

00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:44.240
yeah, the short run
price elasticities

00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:47.510
for gasoline and electricity
tend to be quite low.

00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:53.510
Just looking at
the literature, I

00:39:53.510 --> 00:39:56.180
think that the studies
tend to cluster more

00:39:56.180 --> 00:39:59.480
toward the low end
of those ranges.

00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:04.150
So price elasticity of 0.1
means I double the price.

00:40:04.150 --> 00:40:07.760
Consumption goes down by 10%.

00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:10.720
0.2 means 20%.

00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:13.150
So these are small responses.

00:40:13.150 --> 00:40:15.090
These are low elasticities.

00:40:15.090 --> 00:40:18.540
Notice there's a
big difference--

00:40:18.540 --> 00:40:22.310
factor of 2, 2 and 1/2 there.

00:40:22.310 --> 00:40:26.540
Bigger in gasoline
than electricity,

00:40:26.540 --> 00:40:30.520
which makes a little more
sense but only a little.

00:40:33.460 --> 00:40:35.410
The income elasticity
of electricity I'm

00:40:35.410 --> 00:40:37.180
going to return to.

00:40:37.180 --> 00:40:40.670
In the long run, that's
tended to be pretty high.

00:40:40.670 --> 00:40:43.410
Most estimates say,
as people get richer,

00:40:43.410 --> 00:40:45.560
they use more electricity.

00:40:45.560 --> 00:40:50.750
And it's plus or minus
proportional to income.

00:40:50.750 --> 00:40:53.840
You add appliances,
bigger house.

00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:55.820
All the things that
take electricity

00:40:55.820 --> 00:40:57.290
tend to go up with income.

00:40:57.290 --> 00:40:59.030
And that affect is not small.

00:40:59.030 --> 00:41:02.580
In the short run, well,
that's pretty small, right?

00:41:02.580 --> 00:41:03.530
I mean.

00:41:03.530 --> 00:41:07.910
My income goes up
significantly in the short run.

00:41:07.910 --> 00:41:09.320
What do I use electricity for?

00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:11.100
It's mostly related.

00:41:11.100 --> 00:41:15.000
These are residential,
mostly residential.

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:16.710
There's relatively
little I can change

00:41:16.710 --> 00:41:20.000
until I start changing assets.

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:23.350
So it makes sense
that again, there's

00:41:23.350 --> 00:41:25.000
a big long run, short-run gap.

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:27.340
What's interesting here is
the long-run elasticities

00:41:27.340 --> 00:41:30.490
are pretty big historically.

00:41:30.490 --> 00:41:32.220
Yeah, Andrew.

00:41:32.220 --> 00:41:35.220
AUDIENCE: Do these numbers--

00:41:35.220 --> 00:41:40.455
they seem to take on something
from the '70s to now.

00:41:40.455 --> 00:41:42.830
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: No, I'm
going to come right to that.

00:41:46.220 --> 00:41:49.310
The width of those ranges ought
to tell you that these are not

00:41:49.310 --> 00:41:52.220
constants of nature.

00:41:52.220 --> 00:41:54.980
This is a summary of human
behavior, human behavior

00:41:54.980 --> 00:41:56.990
changes.

00:41:56.990 --> 00:41:58.970
So they do change over time.

00:42:04.990 --> 00:42:08.480
And the problem,
there is a piece

00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:11.967
I could have assigned
because it's pretty simple.

00:42:11.967 --> 00:42:13.550
There's a piece
that's argued, there's

00:42:13.550 --> 00:42:17.300
been a big change in the
price elasticity of demand

00:42:17.300 --> 00:42:19.160
for gasoline in the '80s.

00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:21.650
And I'm trying to remember
whether it goes up or down.

00:42:21.650 --> 00:42:25.580
So people have looked at
this, but not much, not much.

00:42:25.580 --> 00:42:28.040
You just see different
studies from different periods

00:42:28.040 --> 00:42:30.720
and in different countries
getting different results.

00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:33.410
And you say, well, maybe
that's a change in reality

00:42:33.410 --> 00:42:37.050
or maybe that's a
different method, right?

00:42:37.050 --> 00:42:39.045
It depends on data.

00:42:39.045 --> 00:42:41.940
It depends on, can
you study households?

00:42:41.940 --> 00:42:43.157
Is this aggregate data?

00:42:43.157 --> 00:42:44.240
What are you working with?

00:42:47.110 --> 00:42:49.720
But I want to make
a couple of points

00:42:49.720 --> 00:42:51.730
about this stuff being
constants of nature.

00:42:54.290 --> 00:43:00.010
This is one of the
interesting puzzles.

00:43:00.010 --> 00:43:03.140
This is electricity demand.

00:43:03.140 --> 00:43:06.020
And if you look at electricity
use in the United States

00:43:06.020 --> 00:43:12.460
before about 1970, you get
sort of the top two rows.

00:43:12.460 --> 00:43:15.940
You get pretty
good growth in GDP.

00:43:15.940 --> 00:43:17.540
And these are not per capita.

00:43:17.540 --> 00:43:22.060
So this is total
electricity use, total GDP.

00:43:22.060 --> 00:43:26.200
That's pretty good annual
growth rates, 3 and 1/2, 4,

00:43:26.200 --> 00:43:30.120
and very big growth
rates in electricity.

00:43:30.120 --> 00:43:35.195
So the conventional wisdom
was the income elasticity

00:43:35.195 --> 00:43:36.380
is greater than 1.

00:43:36.380 --> 00:43:39.160
And the price
elasticity is small.

00:43:39.160 --> 00:43:44.550
Now, there really wasn't
much historical experience

00:43:44.550 --> 00:43:48.690
you could base that on
except the economy had grown.

00:43:48.690 --> 00:43:50.580
And if you go back
farther, the figures

00:43:50.580 --> 00:43:53.370
get even bigger for
growth in electricity.

00:43:53.370 --> 00:43:57.500
But I didn't have
everything back far enough.

00:43:57.500 --> 00:44:03.140
The experience was GDP
grows pretty smoothly.

00:44:03.140 --> 00:44:06.020
Not much falloff in
electricity in recessions.

00:44:06.020 --> 00:44:09.290
So we're looking here at
the long run over decades.

00:44:09.290 --> 00:44:12.980
And prices do vary
from time to time

00:44:12.980 --> 00:44:15.680
but nobody can see an effect.

00:44:15.680 --> 00:44:19.560
So we come now to the '70s.

00:44:19.560 --> 00:44:20.850
And there's an oil shock.

00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:26.230
And what happens is a
consequence of the oil shock

00:44:26.230 --> 00:44:29.290
is all kinds of inputs
to electricity go up.

00:44:29.290 --> 00:44:32.770
And instead of declining
faster than other prices,

00:44:32.770 --> 00:44:35.110
the price of electricity
is rising faster

00:44:35.110 --> 00:44:37.540
than other prices.

00:44:37.540 --> 00:44:46.570
So what do you think happened
to the total consumption

00:44:46.570 --> 00:44:49.210
of electricity?

00:44:49.210 --> 00:44:52.252
How many think it
went up by 1% to 2%?

00:44:55.204 --> 00:44:56.195
2% to 3%?

00:45:01.070 --> 00:45:02.405
Thank you, Julian.

00:45:05.150 --> 00:45:06.110
3 to 4?

00:45:09.050 --> 00:45:11.360
How many think we shut
off the electricity?

00:45:11.360 --> 00:45:14.220
4 to 5.

00:45:14.220 --> 00:45:15.420
Oh, come on.

00:45:15.420 --> 00:45:16.230
You've got to vote.

00:45:16.230 --> 00:45:17.280
4 to 5, all right.

00:45:21.080 --> 00:45:24.320
It went up by 4.

00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:29.710
So you immediately say, wow,
income growth actually wasn't

00:45:29.710 --> 00:45:31.900
that bad over that period.

00:45:31.900 --> 00:45:35.540
There must be more price
sensitivity than we thought.

00:45:35.540 --> 00:45:36.898
We got it wrong.

00:45:36.898 --> 00:45:39.440
And we were fooled by the fact
that we didn't have much price

00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:40.220
variation.

00:45:40.220 --> 00:45:45.290
Prices moved and
growth slowed sharply

00:45:45.290 --> 00:45:47.330
from those earlier numbers.

00:45:47.330 --> 00:45:53.830
So we come now to the
decade of the '80s.

00:45:53.830 --> 00:45:56.630
Income growth picks up.

00:45:56.630 --> 00:45:58.370
Prices start going down again.

00:46:01.900 --> 00:46:04.810
What happens to
electricity growth?

00:46:04.810 --> 00:46:07.540
Is it above 4%?

00:46:07.540 --> 00:46:08.995
How many think it's above 4%?

00:46:11.600 --> 00:46:12.995
How many think it's below 4%?

00:46:15.560 --> 00:46:19.250
Some of you think it's
an imaginary number,

00:46:19.250 --> 00:46:22.280
I'm missing votes here, OK.

00:46:22.280 --> 00:46:25.310
Those who voted
say it's above 4%.

00:46:25.310 --> 00:46:26.450
And yet it wasn't.

00:46:30.170 --> 00:46:37.760
So now you say, how are
people making these decisions?

00:46:37.760 --> 00:46:40.250
There's clearly
some change that's

00:46:40.250 --> 00:46:42.400
happened on the
demand side, right?

00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:47.210
I mean, something's
different here.

00:46:47.210 --> 00:46:52.530
Is it that people were shocked
by the high prices they

00:46:52.530 --> 00:46:55.260
encountered and the price
increases they encountered

00:46:55.260 --> 00:46:59.220
in the '70s and for the first
time they thought about not

00:46:59.220 --> 00:47:01.470
buying every electrical device?

00:47:01.470 --> 00:47:03.510
And so you got
slower growth, even

00:47:03.510 --> 00:47:11.010
though incomes were growing and
prices were declining a bit--

00:47:11.010 --> 00:47:12.390
reasonable hypothesis.

00:47:15.500 --> 00:47:17.130
You can test it.

00:47:17.130 --> 00:47:23.670
Is there any price
and income effect?

00:47:23.670 --> 00:47:26.840
Growth picks up in the '90s.

00:47:26.840 --> 00:47:30.740
Prices come down in the '90s
for electricity and other things

00:47:30.740 --> 00:47:32.550
as well.

00:47:32.550 --> 00:47:34.330
What happens to
electricity demand?

00:47:34.330 --> 00:47:35.580
Now, you've got to vote folks.

00:47:35.580 --> 00:47:38.940
This is no fun watching people
go, oh, geez, I don't know.

00:47:38.940 --> 00:47:42.580
How many think its above 3%?

00:47:42.580 --> 00:47:46.480
OK, how many people
think is below 3%?

00:47:46.480 --> 00:47:49.360
OK, the smart people win.

00:47:49.360 --> 00:47:51.580
It's below 3%.

00:47:51.580 --> 00:47:53.920
Why is it below 3%?

00:47:53.920 --> 00:47:55.480
Income growth picked up.

00:47:55.480 --> 00:47:58.940
Prices started declining
pretty reasonably.

00:47:58.940 --> 00:47:59.954
No one quite knows.

00:47:59.954 --> 00:48:00.454
You know.

00:48:00.454 --> 00:48:02.070
AUDIENCE: A little
earlier on in the years

00:48:02.070 --> 00:48:04.410
people were buying more
appliances like refrigerators

00:48:04.410 --> 00:48:05.310
and TVs.

00:48:05.310 --> 00:48:07.170
And then as you get
into the later years,

00:48:07.170 --> 00:48:08.970
everybody already
has those appliances.

00:48:08.970 --> 00:48:10.667
But they were getting
more efficient.

00:48:10.667 --> 00:48:12.750
And so they're replacing
their existing appliances

00:48:12.750 --> 00:48:14.830
with more efficient
appliances and so

00:48:14.830 --> 00:48:17.020
electricity use didn't grow.

00:48:17.020 --> 00:48:20.080
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Maybe, maybe, yeah, it's

00:48:20.080 --> 00:48:21.880
not implausible.

00:48:21.880 --> 00:48:23.320
You could test it, right?

00:48:23.320 --> 00:48:26.380
You could look at purchase
patterns of various appliances.

00:48:26.380 --> 00:48:28.990
This is national use.

00:48:28.990 --> 00:48:31.720
You're getting the impact
of probably a decline

00:48:31.720 --> 00:48:33.160
of manufacturing.

00:48:33.160 --> 00:48:34.420
This isn't all residential.

00:48:34.420 --> 00:48:36.730
So you're getting
less industrial load.

00:48:36.730 --> 00:48:41.480
And you may also be getting
more efficient new construction

00:48:41.480 --> 00:48:43.570
in office buildings.

00:48:43.570 --> 00:48:45.453
People began to think
about efficiency.

00:48:45.453 --> 00:48:47.120
They didn't think
much about efficiency.

00:48:47.120 --> 00:48:49.300
But when you start to
think about efficiency,

00:48:49.300 --> 00:48:52.350
you begin to get
gains in efficiency.

00:48:52.350 --> 00:48:54.430
So I'm guessing its efficiency.

00:48:54.430 --> 00:48:59.650
It's not that people stopped
wanting energy services,

00:48:59.650 --> 00:49:03.160
but it's kind of implausible
that suddenly you

00:49:03.160 --> 00:49:06.280
know, oh, we're going to go
back to small black and white

00:49:06.280 --> 00:49:08.200
televisions because
the big colors use

00:49:08.200 --> 00:49:09.550
too much electricity.

00:49:09.550 --> 00:49:12.160
And I'm willing to
bet refrigerators

00:49:12.160 --> 00:49:18.840
didn't shrink over this
period, so probably efficiency.

00:49:18.840 --> 00:49:22.080
But I can tell you,
it's a lot easier

00:49:22.080 --> 00:49:24.870
to talk about it
after the fact than it

00:49:24.870 --> 00:49:28.290
was to see it, to see
it coming on the basis

00:49:28.290 --> 00:49:30.460
of historical experience.

00:49:30.460 --> 00:49:34.410
Oh, I should take
this after '07.

00:49:34.410 --> 00:49:36.960
So this was not a great decade.

00:49:36.960 --> 00:49:40.065
And I won't trouble you more.

00:49:40.065 --> 00:49:41.190
This is not a great decade.

00:49:41.190 --> 00:49:42.270
Income growth slowed.

00:49:42.270 --> 00:49:46.540
And if I took it to the end of
the decade, it's really ugly.

00:49:46.540 --> 00:49:48.210
Let me not run
into the recession.

00:49:48.210 --> 00:49:50.940
But even before the recession,
income growth slowed.

00:49:50.940 --> 00:49:52.960
Energy prices began to go up.

00:49:52.960 --> 00:49:57.540
And as you might expect,
electricity use slowed as well.

00:49:57.540 --> 00:50:02.340
Forecasts out to about
20, 30 show less than 1%

00:50:02.340 --> 00:50:04.030
growth a year.

00:50:04.030 --> 00:50:07.960
So the business has changed
from one where-- and even

00:50:07.960 --> 00:50:10.090
with reasonable economic
growth assumptions--

00:50:10.090 --> 00:50:16.420
where 10% and bigger than
that before 1950, 5%, 10%

00:50:16.420 --> 00:50:18.640
to maybe 1%.

00:50:18.640 --> 00:50:22.095
Maybe 1% over the
next 20 years, OK?

00:50:25.350 --> 00:50:27.720
That should have
come up earlier.

00:50:27.720 --> 00:50:29.190
That's one caution.

00:50:29.190 --> 00:50:31.560
Demand functions are
not constants of nature.

00:50:31.560 --> 00:50:36.780
And if anybody says
the elasticity is x,

00:50:36.780 --> 00:50:39.420
it probably means the
elasticity has been x.

00:50:39.420 --> 00:50:41.460
Or we've got a pretty
good study that estimates

00:50:41.460 --> 00:50:42.870
that the elasticity is x.

00:50:42.870 --> 00:50:47.190
These are not
constants of nature.

00:50:47.190 --> 00:50:53.070
And now let me sort of lead
into the intro to Wednesday.

00:50:57.360 --> 00:51:05.760
The earlier discussion of
derived demand and long run,

00:51:05.760 --> 00:51:08.820
short run and how
you estimate sort of

00:51:08.820 --> 00:51:11.460
assumed in the background
the standard economist model

00:51:11.460 --> 00:51:13.770
of rational behavior.

00:51:13.770 --> 00:51:14.850
Comes now, McKinsey.

00:51:17.440 --> 00:51:21.040
And you've got a very
short McKinsey assignment

00:51:21.040 --> 00:51:22.690
on the readings.

00:51:22.690 --> 00:51:26.530
McKinsey has made a lot of
money, basically country

00:51:26.530 --> 00:51:32.540
to country saying, how
much energy conservation

00:51:32.540 --> 00:51:33.860
can be free?

00:51:33.860 --> 00:51:35.750
How can you do it for free?

00:51:35.750 --> 00:51:37.430
And they do curves like this.

00:51:37.430 --> 00:51:38.990
I forget what this one is for.

00:51:38.990 --> 00:51:42.870
But this is potential
gigatons of carbon.

00:51:42.870 --> 00:51:44.390
But they do it for
energy, as well.

00:51:44.390 --> 00:51:47.150
Gigatons of carbon
dioxide reductions

00:51:47.150 --> 00:51:49.220
per year and the cost.

00:51:49.220 --> 00:51:51.350
And this is all negative.

00:51:51.350 --> 00:51:54.530
This is all better than free.

00:51:54.530 --> 00:51:56.460
And they have it for
energy consumption.

00:51:56.460 --> 00:51:58.820
And they have it for
a bunch of countries.

00:51:58.820 --> 00:52:02.000
As I say, they've
made a lot of money.

00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:03.250
But they're not the only ones.

00:52:03.250 --> 00:52:07.990
Let me not pick on McKinsey,
as much fun as that is to do.

00:52:07.990 --> 00:52:10.330
This is called the
efficiency paradox.

00:52:10.330 --> 00:52:13.550
And it's been around
since the '70s

00:52:13.550 --> 00:52:16.490
that there are lots of
studies that say, look,

00:52:16.490 --> 00:52:19.220
you would save money if.

00:52:19.220 --> 00:52:23.975
Now, we're going to take a look
at reasons why this persists.

00:52:27.460 --> 00:52:32.820
But I will give you an example
I encountered personally.

00:52:32.820 --> 00:52:36.300
I came back from Washington,
EPA had just started its Energy

00:52:36.300 --> 00:52:37.860
Star program.

00:52:37.860 --> 00:52:42.360
I went to people at MIT, and I
said, why not sign up for it?

00:52:42.360 --> 00:52:45.330
Why doesn't MIT sign up for the
Energy Star program because A,

00:52:45.330 --> 00:52:47.130
you get PR points.

00:52:47.130 --> 00:52:52.470
And B, all you promised to do is
to use more efficient lighting

00:52:52.470 --> 00:52:55.210
when it saves you money.

00:52:55.210 --> 00:52:57.580
You promise to use
more efficient lighting

00:52:57.580 --> 00:52:59.960
when it saves you money.

00:52:59.960 --> 00:53:03.940
I could not get that sale made.

00:53:03.940 --> 00:53:05.647
And nobody's behaving
irrationally,

00:53:05.647 --> 00:53:06.730
and nobody's being a jerk.

00:53:06.730 --> 00:53:09.340
And we will come
back to it later when

00:53:09.340 --> 00:53:12.760
we talk about biodiesel at MIT.

00:53:12.760 --> 00:53:15.760
Because it's exactly
the same phenomenon.

00:53:15.760 --> 00:53:21.400
Why did it take them three
years to sell biodiesel at MIT.

00:53:21.400 --> 00:53:28.740
So we'll talk about that set
of reasons why this persists.

00:53:28.740 --> 00:53:31.560
But let me talk
about some others.

00:53:31.560 --> 00:53:35.250
I mean, does anyone know
who Amory Lovins is?

00:53:38.190 --> 00:53:41.610
OK, Amory Lovins has
been an efficiency guru,

00:53:41.610 --> 00:53:46.750
an energy efficiency
guru since the 1970s.

00:53:46.750 --> 00:53:50.500
Amory Lovins, he heads the
Rocky Mountain Institute.

00:53:50.500 --> 00:53:54.550
He lives in a house that has
quintuple pane glass and highly

00:53:54.550 --> 00:53:55.120
insulated.

00:53:55.120 --> 00:53:58.060
And I think uses
no outside energy.

00:53:58.060 --> 00:53:59.470
And Amory, yeah, you know Amory.

00:53:59.470 --> 00:54:00.200
OK.

00:54:00.200 --> 00:54:02.530
AUDIENCE: Yeah, well, He
has a super efficient home.

00:54:02.530 --> 00:54:05.270
But he can't run the
computer off solar power

00:54:05.270 --> 00:54:08.020
so he does actually--
office equipment

00:54:08.020 --> 00:54:09.695
he has to get outside help for.

00:54:09.695 --> 00:54:12.070
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: I'm really
disappointed right there.

00:54:12.070 --> 00:54:15.160
Yeah, I'll tell you.

00:54:15.160 --> 00:54:20.030
But I was once lobbied
by him in Washington.

00:54:20.030 --> 00:54:23.890
And he came in and
explained how there

00:54:23.890 --> 00:54:27.940
are all these triple-pane glass
and all these wonderful energy

00:54:27.940 --> 00:54:31.360
saving devices that would
more than pay for themselves

00:54:31.360 --> 00:54:34.160
and reduce US
energy consumption.

00:54:34.160 --> 00:54:38.810
And a guy who was working for
me looked at him and said,

00:54:38.810 --> 00:54:42.530
you are saying consumers
save money doing this stuff.

00:54:42.530 --> 00:54:44.930
He said, yes, that's right.

00:54:44.930 --> 00:54:47.173
And my guy's response
was, that's fabulous.

00:54:47.173 --> 00:54:49.340
It means we don't have to
have a government program.

00:54:52.400 --> 00:54:55.820
There was a pause.

00:54:55.820 --> 00:54:57.590
We'll come back to again.

00:54:57.590 --> 00:54:59.510
There ought to be a pause.

00:54:59.510 --> 00:55:01.610
But it was a great line.

00:55:01.610 --> 00:55:02.660
It was a great line.

00:55:02.660 --> 00:55:04.490
He hadn't thought of that.

00:55:04.490 --> 00:55:06.590
He has by now.

00:55:06.590 --> 00:55:08.570
So why?

00:55:08.570 --> 00:55:13.610
Well, one set of answers
in the '70s was these.

00:55:13.610 --> 00:55:15.997
And I don't mean
to demean engineers

00:55:15.997 --> 00:55:17.330
by saying engineering estimates.

00:55:17.330 --> 00:55:20.630
They're sort of back of the
envelope, typical building,

00:55:20.630 --> 00:55:24.020
typical household
kind of analysis

00:55:24.020 --> 00:55:27.860
that a lot of the early work
was just too optimistic.

00:55:27.860 --> 00:55:30.327
It just assumed, you know,
you'd throw out the furnace.

00:55:30.327 --> 00:55:31.910
Well, you don't throw
out the furnace.

00:55:31.910 --> 00:55:33.577
And you don't save
money by throwing out

00:55:33.577 --> 00:55:36.620
a five-year-old furnace
and replacing it early.

00:55:36.620 --> 00:55:44.440
So there were a lot of
critiques that said,

00:55:44.440 --> 00:55:46.540
these estimates are flawed.

00:55:46.540 --> 00:55:48.280
Well, they might be flawed.

00:55:48.280 --> 00:55:51.310
But there have been lots
of clear examples later.

00:55:51.310 --> 00:55:55.210
The MIT lighting example was an
absolutely dead clear example

00:55:55.210 --> 00:56:00.080
of money on the sidewalk,
money on the sidewalk.

00:56:00.080 --> 00:56:02.080
So the note sites,
and I think I put

00:56:02.080 --> 00:56:05.770
on the list the
Hausman-Joskow paper.

00:56:05.770 --> 00:56:10.940
And I say, well, if you look
at consumer decision making--

00:56:10.940 --> 00:56:14.900
and Hausman did a classic study
of air conditioners-- consumers

00:56:14.900 --> 00:56:18.030
act like they have very
high discount rates.

00:56:18.030 --> 00:56:21.230
So you say, can you
rationalize why consumers

00:56:21.230 --> 00:56:24.110
don't spend a little more
for energy efficient air

00:56:24.110 --> 00:56:24.710
conditioners?

00:56:24.710 --> 00:56:27.650
This was using data well
before they were all really

00:56:27.650 --> 00:56:29.153
efficient with standards.

00:56:29.153 --> 00:56:30.320
How do you rationalize that?

00:56:30.320 --> 00:56:32.660
Well, you rationalize
it by saying,

00:56:32.660 --> 00:56:36.230
consumers have limited
access to capital.

00:56:36.230 --> 00:56:39.400
They don't want to borrow
to buy an air conditioner.

00:56:39.400 --> 00:56:45.850
So they act as if their discount
rate is 20%, 30% a year,

00:56:45.850 --> 00:56:47.600
which means another
way to think about it,

00:56:47.600 --> 00:56:51.230
I need a really quick payback
if I'm going to put money

00:56:51.230 --> 00:56:54.200
up front in energy efficiency.

00:56:54.200 --> 00:56:58.750
Well, two points, and I'll
come to the second point

00:56:58.750 --> 00:57:01.050
in just a minute.

00:57:01.050 --> 00:57:08.650
The first point is, that doesn't
explain business behavior.

00:57:08.650 --> 00:57:15.160
The 20% to 30% discount rate,
why would a business do that?

00:57:15.160 --> 00:57:17.020
If you can raise
capital at let's say

00:57:17.020 --> 00:57:20.860
a canonical rate in
the old days of 10%,

00:57:20.860 --> 00:57:24.010
and you got an investment
in efficiency that

00:57:24.010 --> 00:57:28.830
has a 20% return, why
wouldn't you make it?

00:57:28.830 --> 00:57:31.330
You can see the household might
have trouble raising capital

00:57:31.330 --> 00:57:33.730
to insulate the house or
to buy air conditioning,

00:57:33.730 --> 00:57:35.470
to buy a more efficient
air conditioner.

00:57:35.470 --> 00:57:38.440
But Walmart, why
wouldn't Walmart do it?

00:57:38.440 --> 00:57:39.670
Well, Walmart probably does.

00:57:39.670 --> 00:57:42.640
But why did we seem
to see money lying

00:57:42.640 --> 00:57:45.880
on the ground for commercial
and industrial demand?

00:57:45.880 --> 00:57:49.870
And we'll see a case later in
the course of an energy saving

00:57:49.870 --> 00:57:52.780
opportunity being confronted
by a perfectly rational profit

00:57:52.780 --> 00:57:55.360
maximizing firm, high
rate of return that

00:57:55.360 --> 00:57:58.042
is a very hard sell.

00:57:58.042 --> 00:58:01.170
And we'll see biodiesel
was a very hard sell.

00:58:01.170 --> 00:58:03.270
So you got to have
other explanations.

00:58:03.270 --> 00:58:06.900
The high discount rate doesn't
make sense for businesses.

00:58:06.900 --> 00:58:07.733
Yeah.

00:58:07.733 --> 00:58:09.730
AUDIENCE: Yes, would
it make more sense

00:58:09.730 --> 00:58:12.130
for the utility
firms to kind of take

00:58:12.130 --> 00:58:16.300
charge of going and
trying to make buildings

00:58:16.300 --> 00:58:18.868
more efficient in that sense?

00:58:18.868 --> 00:58:21.160
They're going to be more
aligned in terms of the profit

00:58:21.160 --> 00:58:23.998
they can make because
they'll be using less fuel

00:58:23.998 --> 00:58:25.790
for the same sort of
benefit they are going

00:58:25.790 --> 00:58:26.873
to provide for the people.

00:58:26.873 --> 00:58:29.980
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Well, we're
going to come back to that.

00:58:29.980 --> 00:58:34.180
It depends on, to
get to that, you

00:58:34.180 --> 00:58:37.010
have to have a diagnosis
of the problem.

00:58:37.010 --> 00:58:45.490
So if the problem is ignorance,
which is a common argument,

00:58:45.490 --> 00:58:48.700
then you say the utility
has better information.

00:58:48.700 --> 00:58:50.560
And so it could
probably do this.

00:58:50.560 --> 00:58:52.720
Although, the
utilities expertise

00:58:52.720 --> 00:58:56.350
is generating electricity,
not cooling buildings, right?

00:58:56.350 --> 00:59:01.520
They can acquire the expertise,
but so could some third party.

00:59:01.520 --> 00:59:02.630
And some firms do, right?

00:59:02.630 --> 00:59:04.940
People do go around.

00:59:04.940 --> 00:59:07.130
There are a number of
firms, I'm involved

00:59:07.130 --> 00:59:10.490
with one of them that is
trying to make a business out

00:59:10.490 --> 00:59:13.900
of selling energy
efficiency to households.

00:59:13.900 --> 00:59:17.530
It is not an easy business,
not an easy business.

00:59:17.530 --> 00:59:20.110
But the problem with
utilities though--

00:59:20.110 --> 00:59:22.300
and we'll come back
to this for sure--

00:59:22.300 --> 00:59:25.670
they get compensated
for selling electricity.

00:59:25.670 --> 00:59:31.090
So they have an
inherent conflict.

00:59:31.090 --> 00:59:35.240
If I can find a way not to rely
on somebody that's conflicted,

00:59:35.240 --> 00:59:36.490
I will.

00:59:36.490 --> 00:59:40.692
If you say, I'm paying you
for selling electricity now,

00:59:40.692 --> 00:59:42.400
I'd like you to go
around and tell people

00:59:42.400 --> 00:59:46.750
how to consume less, I'd begin
to wonder how effective you're

00:59:46.750 --> 00:59:48.100
going to be.

00:59:48.100 --> 00:59:49.000
I can make you do it.

00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:50.042
I can make you go around.

00:59:50.042 --> 00:59:52.510
And states do this,
but the effectiveness

00:59:52.510 --> 00:59:58.210
varies because your motivation
isn't necessarily terrific.

00:59:58.210 --> 01:00:02.140
So we've got this low
hanging fruit problem.

01:00:02.140 --> 01:00:06.040
And we're going to see this
in a number of settings

01:00:06.040 --> 01:00:10.510
that how come opportunities
to increase efficiency

01:00:10.510 --> 01:00:16.230
that are apparently profitable
don't get picked up.

01:00:16.230 --> 01:00:19.440
But the world is even
more complicated.

01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:22.100
Sometimes people over-invest.

01:00:22.100 --> 01:00:23.840
Let me talk about the Prius.

01:00:23.840 --> 01:00:26.750
How many people or
their parents have

01:00:26.750 --> 01:00:29.270
Prius, or relatives have Prius?

01:00:29.270 --> 01:00:31.250
Yeah, lots of people have Prius.

01:00:31.250 --> 01:00:33.470
And I'm not going to
criticize your rationality

01:00:33.470 --> 01:00:35.630
in what I'm saying here, OK?

01:00:35.630 --> 01:00:36.560
OK.

01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:38.780
So three million
people have bought them

01:00:38.780 --> 01:00:40.880
and they sold three
million worldwide.

01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:43.478
They've sold over a
million in the US.

01:00:43.478 --> 01:00:45.770
I'm now relying on others
who have looked hard at this.

01:00:45.770 --> 01:00:47.660
But they tell me that
in terms of driving,

01:00:47.660 --> 01:00:51.150
in terms of interior amenities,
the styling is different.

01:00:51.150 --> 01:00:55.710
But in terms of interior
design, it's a Corolla.

01:00:55.710 --> 01:00:58.260
But it's a Corolla that
gets 50 miles a gallon

01:00:58.260 --> 01:01:01.440
instead of 28 miles a gallon.

01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:05.990
So let's ask the question,
is it worth the difference

01:01:05.990 --> 01:01:07.856
in upfront cost?

01:01:07.856 --> 01:01:12.650
Did these three million
people make a good Investment?

01:01:12.650 --> 01:01:16.100
Remember, these are people
who are not buying energy

01:01:16.100 --> 01:01:17.930
efficient air conditioners.

01:01:17.930 --> 01:01:21.420
Well, maybe they are, but
not that many others are.

01:01:21.420 --> 01:01:23.360
So let's look at it.

01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:26.580
We're going to ask if
the cost difference--

01:01:26.580 --> 01:01:28.080
so you save money on gasoline.

01:01:28.080 --> 01:01:31.010
A cost difference is the
upfront cost difference.

01:01:31.010 --> 01:01:33.530
S is the annual
savings on gasoline.

01:01:33.530 --> 01:01:34.640
R is the interest rate.

01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:37.400
And T is, how long
do you have to keep

01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:41.030
the car until the
savings on gasoline

01:01:41.030 --> 01:01:43.400
justify the purchase price.

01:01:43.400 --> 01:01:47.000
OK, so that's just a
discounting exercise.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:53.420
If there's no interest rate,
you just divide the upfront cost

01:01:53.420 --> 01:01:57.360
by the annual savings and that
gives you the number of years.

01:01:57.360 --> 01:01:59.010
That's 0 interest rate.

01:01:59.010 --> 01:02:01.620
If there is a positive
interest rate,

01:02:01.620 --> 01:02:06.120
then you ask, you discount
S per year out to T.

01:02:06.120 --> 01:02:07.980
And you say, how
large does T have

01:02:07.980 --> 01:02:13.790
to be so that discounted savings
equals the original cost.

01:02:13.790 --> 01:02:19.340
Clearly if the
savings are small,

01:02:19.340 --> 01:02:20.510
there can be no solution.

01:02:20.510 --> 01:02:22.670
There can be no positive
solution to this.

01:02:22.670 --> 01:02:26.840
But if RC is less than S,
it's this simple formula

01:02:26.840 --> 01:02:30.710
you can get in less
than 5 seconds.

01:02:30.710 --> 01:02:32.450
So let's look at it.

01:02:32.450 --> 01:02:36.680
Toyota, these are
data a few years old.

01:02:36.680 --> 01:02:40.580
And they don't
count the subsidies

01:02:40.580 --> 01:02:42.380
that were there for the first--

01:02:42.380 --> 01:02:45.230
in the US I think it
was 60,000 units sold.

01:02:45.230 --> 01:02:47.940
But the subsidies have
long since run out.

01:02:47.940 --> 01:02:52.240
So the average premium,
2008, maybe was $7,450.

01:02:52.240 --> 01:02:53.790
Assume maintenance is the same.

01:02:53.790 --> 01:02:54.950
It may not be.

01:02:54.950 --> 01:02:57.740
Prius may be cheaper.

01:02:57.740 --> 01:03:00.800
Car's average about
12,000 miles a year.

01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:03.050
I can work out the annual cost.

01:03:03.050 --> 01:03:08.530
The difference, the
savings is $566.

01:03:08.530 --> 01:03:16.350
So if the interest
rate is 0, you've

01:03:16.350 --> 01:03:20.110
got to keep the car for
13.2 years to break even.

01:03:20.110 --> 01:03:23.280
Now again, if you have a
subsidy or if the gasoline

01:03:23.280 --> 01:03:27.180
is more expensive,
this will get smaller.

01:03:27.180 --> 01:03:29.430
But that's kind of a long time.

01:03:29.430 --> 01:03:33.570
Cars tend to turn over
after about 10, really.

01:03:33.570 --> 01:03:36.210
And most people don't
say, hold it for 10.

01:03:36.210 --> 01:03:38.610
10 is when they go
out of the fleet.

01:03:38.610 --> 01:03:40.950
So if you're going
to resell, you've

01:03:40.950 --> 01:03:45.180
got to sell to somebody
who also loves Prius.

01:03:45.180 --> 01:03:50.550
If the interest rate
is 5%, not that high,

01:03:50.550 --> 01:03:53.850
you've got to hold
the car for 21.6 years

01:03:53.850 --> 01:03:57.880
before those gasoline savings
pay for the cost difference.

01:03:57.880 --> 01:04:02.680
If the interest rate is above
7.6%, there is no break even.

01:04:02.680 --> 01:04:07.640
You can verify that
you don't satisfy that.

01:04:07.640 --> 01:04:13.090
So you can hold it forever and
the discounted gasoline savings

01:04:13.090 --> 01:04:18.547
don't equal the
original purchase.

01:04:18.547 --> 01:04:19.630
Now, you can play with it.

01:04:19.630 --> 01:04:21.790
You can put in a
per vehicle subsidy.

01:04:21.790 --> 01:04:24.910
You can make gasoline
more expensive.

01:04:24.910 --> 01:04:28.420
But these don't seem
like crazy numbers

01:04:28.420 --> 01:04:30.190
in light of how those cars work.

01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:40.590
And this is the puzzle.

01:04:40.590 --> 01:04:42.960
People act when they're
buying air conditioners

01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:46.150
like their discount
rate is 20% to 30%.

01:04:46.150 --> 01:04:49.650
And they act when they're
buying a Prius like they have

01:04:49.650 --> 01:04:53.790
a really low discount rate.

01:04:53.790 --> 01:04:58.040
Or maybe this is not the
right way to look at it.

01:05:00.870 --> 01:05:03.030
Tell no other
economists I said this.

01:05:03.030 --> 01:05:06.960
But it may be that this sort
of economic approach I was

01:05:06.960 --> 01:05:08.970
taking here is missing stuff.

01:05:12.230 --> 01:05:13.190
It's missing a lot.

01:05:13.190 --> 01:05:15.430
Why do people buy
a Prius by the way?

01:05:15.430 --> 01:05:18.000
Do people buy a Prius
to save gasoline?

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:18.500
Scot.

01:05:18.500 --> 01:05:20.917
AUDIENCE: A lot of people just
buy environmental friendly.

01:05:20.917 --> 01:05:23.430
And they want to do something
and something like that.

01:05:23.430 --> 01:05:26.340
And so even if it might not
be saving them that much money

01:05:26.340 --> 01:05:28.560
or saving them money at
all, they still do it.

01:05:28.560 --> 01:05:32.620
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: They
want to do the right thing.

01:05:32.620 --> 01:05:34.140
There's another
argument that people

01:05:34.140 --> 01:05:36.780
make is, there's a reason
the Prius doesn't look

01:05:36.780 --> 01:05:41.460
like the Corolla, so not only do
you feel satisfied that you're

01:05:41.460 --> 01:05:45.120
doing a good thing, people can
see you're doing a good thing.

01:05:45.120 --> 01:05:48.900
Because I mean, that's a funny
looking car to be honest.

01:05:48.900 --> 01:05:51.270
And people know you're
driving a Prius.

01:05:51.270 --> 01:05:53.550
There are other hybrids you
don't people are driving.

01:05:53.550 --> 01:05:56.890
And they don't sell
as well as the Prius.

01:05:56.890 --> 01:05:58.270
None of that's here.

01:05:58.270 --> 01:06:00.850
The do the good
thing isn't there.

01:06:00.850 --> 01:06:04.960
The other people see I'm doing
a good thing isn't there.

01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:10.840
This is not the drive demand for
transportation services story

01:06:10.840 --> 01:06:13.260
that gets the Prius sold.

01:06:13.260 --> 01:06:14.295
This is other things.

01:06:17.080 --> 01:06:22.330
And we're going to hear from
professor Silbey on Wednesday

01:06:22.330 --> 01:06:24.040
about some of the other things.

01:06:24.040 --> 01:06:26.470
Have you questions or comments.

01:06:26.470 --> 01:06:28.150
Paper going OK.

01:06:28.150 --> 01:06:29.352
Obena.

01:06:29.352 --> 01:06:31.810
AUDIENCE: Did they consider
the time saved at the gas pump?

01:06:31.810 --> 01:06:34.220
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Hmm,
time saved at the gas pump?

01:06:34.220 --> 01:06:35.800
AUDIENCE: Right.

01:06:35.800 --> 01:06:37.550
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
I don't know the size

01:06:37.550 --> 01:06:38.930
of the tank on that thing.

01:06:38.930 --> 01:06:40.070
Does it save you time?

01:06:40.070 --> 01:06:41.690
It probably does.

01:06:41.690 --> 01:06:44.420
AUDIENCE: Full time, so that
would be two or three weeks.

01:06:44.420 --> 01:06:45.020
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
These are people who

01:06:45.020 --> 01:06:46.490
value their time very highly.

01:06:49.430 --> 01:06:51.683
I have to say, I value
mine really highly.

01:06:51.683 --> 01:06:52.850
And it never occurred to me.

01:06:52.850 --> 01:06:53.900
But it could be.

01:06:53.900 --> 01:06:56.420
It could be you people all
bill out at $1,000 an hour.

01:06:56.420 --> 01:06:58.580
And a few minutes
is worth saving.

01:06:58.580 --> 01:07:00.140
Any other questions, comments.

01:07:00.140 --> 01:07:01.880
David.

01:07:01.880 --> 01:07:03.220
AUDIENCE: Yes.

01:07:03.220 --> 01:07:04.850
You could also
regulate a small town

01:07:04.850 --> 01:07:07.190
than the average driven mile?

01:07:07.190 --> 01:07:10.535
So somebody drives less in 2003.

01:07:10.535 --> 01:07:12.160
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
That might be low.

01:07:12.160 --> 01:07:13.510
So maybe it's segments that way.

01:07:13.510 --> 01:07:14.920
Also testable.

01:07:14.920 --> 01:07:17.100
Sarah, does your
family drive a lot?

01:07:17.100 --> 01:07:19.826
AUDIENCE: No, what about risk
aversion and price fluctuations

01:07:19.826 --> 01:07:21.360
in gas?

01:07:21.360 --> 01:07:23.860
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: You figure
this is kind of an insurance

01:07:23.860 --> 01:07:26.590
policy that when gas prices
move, we won't be hit too hard.

01:07:26.590 --> 01:07:29.967
That's another possibility,
also testable, yeah.

01:07:29.967 --> 01:07:32.300
AUDIENCE: I read an article
that production of the Prius

01:07:32.300 --> 01:07:34.396
is actually more inefficient
than the production

01:07:34.396 --> 01:07:35.520
of the Corolla.

01:07:35.520 --> 01:07:38.816
And the energy
that people claimed

01:07:38.816 --> 01:07:42.852
they are saving actually
because of the inefficiency

01:07:42.852 --> 01:07:47.130
of production, you know, they
established it doesn't actually

01:07:47.130 --> 01:07:48.020
save energy.

01:07:48.020 --> 01:07:48.890
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
So they think

01:07:48.890 --> 01:07:50.705
they're doing a good
thing but they're not.

01:07:53.490 --> 01:07:54.540
It's a terrible tragedy.

01:07:54.540 --> 01:07:57.320
Bring your name cards next time.

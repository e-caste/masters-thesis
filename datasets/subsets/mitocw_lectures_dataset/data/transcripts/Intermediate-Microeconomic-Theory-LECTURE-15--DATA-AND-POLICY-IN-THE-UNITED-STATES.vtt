00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:13.160 align:middle line:90%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: All right.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.070 align:middle line:90%
Let's look at this schedule.

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.450 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to do the second
of two applications in trade

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:26.190 align:middle line:84%
today, focusing on the
US and data issues.

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:30.930 align:middle line:84%
So that's where we are
in terms of the schedule.

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:33.780 align:middle line:84%
In terms of the
reading list, we're,

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.240 align:middle line:90%
again, down to lecture 15.

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.320 align:middle line:84%
There's two papers
that are starred here.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.920 align:middle line:84%
And I have a few slides
on each of these--

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.150 align:middle line:84%
one, this Raj Chetty
et al paper having

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:51.210 align:middle line:84%
to do with the
impact of COVID-19.

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.970 align:middle line:84%
And you'll see today
how that fits in to what

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:55.440 align:middle line:90%
we're trying to accomplish.

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.620 align:middle line:84%
And relatedly is this
paper by Scott Baker

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.710 align:middle line:84%
and co-authors, again, on
the impact of the virus.

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:07.170 align:middle line:84%
So you know that I am very
conservative about starring

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:07.830 align:middle line:90%
material.

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.070 align:middle line:84%
But, today, those two
things are starred and given

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.160 align:middle line:84%
important obvious importance
surrounding us of this topic.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.220 align:middle line:84%
You might find them
particularly interesting,

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.440 align:middle line:84%
and I'll introduce
that work today.

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.740 align:middle line:84%
And also, previous lecture,
there were two starred papers

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.880 align:middle line:84%
as well, including Dawkins,
that we didn't cover in class.

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.580 align:middle line:90%
So that's the reading list.

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.700 align:middle line:84%
And then, as usual,
we can review

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.000 align:middle line:84%
a bit what we did last time,
gains and losses from trade.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.970 align:middle line:90%
So it's lecture 14.

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.190 align:middle line:90%
So the first one I earmarked--

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:46.980 align:middle line:84%
"There are two key features
that distinguish households even

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:48.810 align:middle line:90%
within the same village."

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.180 align:middle line:90%
And I wrote this.

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.720 align:middle line:84%
"Pick one of these and be able
to tell a classmate about it."

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.680 align:middle line:84%
Try to tell "a compelling story
about how households differ."

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.750 align:middle line:84%
Imagine if you want to be a
reporter for the news diving

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.180 align:middle line:84%
into a community
and interviewing

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.830 align:middle line:90%
various types of households.

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.890 align:middle line:84%
So let me get
volunteers on this.

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.910 align:middle line:90%


00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.280 align:middle line:90%
Two key features.

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.080 align:middle line:90%
We covered two key features.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.520 align:middle line:90%
I'm asking you to pick one.

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:28.410 align:middle line:90%


00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.250 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: I think the
first one is talent.

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.960 align:middle line:90%
And the second one--

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:39.100 align:middle line:84%
I think maybe it's a
initial fixed assets, which

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.020 align:middle line:90%
can determine your job.

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:45.020 align:middle line:84%
For example, if your
initial asset is low,

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:46.480 align:middle line:90%
maybe you are a wage earner.

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.380 align:middle line:84%
And if your initial
fixed asset is large,

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.060 align:middle line:90%
you own, like, a business.

00:02:53.060 --> 00:03:00.650 align:middle line:84%
And for talent, what we
have discussed is that--

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.050 align:middle line:84%
this is more related
to the sector part.

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:08.140 align:middle line:84%
I remember that if we take all
the capital and labor which

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.950 align:middle line:84%
is not related to talent,
and we get the talent,

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.200 align:middle line:84%
and we have sector
average talent,

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.520 align:middle line:84%
and if we also
exclude that part,

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:23.410 align:middle line:84%
and we have household-specific
talent, which will distinguish

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:25.720 align:middle line:90%
households between each other.

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:32.470 align:middle line:84%
And this talent will also
be related to the jobs

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:34.720 align:middle line:90%
that the households have.

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:40.300 align:middle line:84%
And I remember there is a table
in the stats which have, like,

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.970 align:middle line:90%
livestock and something.

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:43.797 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:03:43.797 --> 00:03:45.130 align:middle line:90%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Perfect answer.

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:47.420 align:middle line:90%
That's really terrific.

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:48.740 align:middle line:90%
It's hard to add to that.

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:49.450 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:51.100 align:middle line:84%
In a village, you
have rich people

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:54.640 align:middle line:84%
and poor people distinguished
by assets, or even

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.050 align:middle line:90%
real, tangible assets.

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:58.870 align:middle line:84%
And you've got people
that differ in talent.

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.900 align:middle line:84%
The talent is something
you don't see directly

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.380 align:middle line:84%
that you can back it out from
how much they're producing,

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.840 align:middle line:84%
controlling for the
capital and labor

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.010 align:middle line:90%
that they utilize in production.

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.560 align:middle line:84%
And so there was
a big dispersion

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:19.120 align:middle line:84%
in that productivity level
across different households.

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.899 align:middle line:90%
Great answer.

00:04:19.899 --> 00:04:20.620 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.450 align:middle line:90%


00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:28.280 align:middle line:84%
Next up, "Follow the lines
of national level product

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:32.300 align:middle line:84%
and income accounts,"
so-called NIPA, national income

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:33.860 align:middle line:90%
and product accounts.

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:35.450 align:middle line:84%
Essentially, this
question is saying,

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:38.060 align:middle line:90%
where does GDP come from?

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:42.880 align:middle line:84%
What is it, and how
do we measure it?

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:48.600 align:middle line:84%
And, in particular, how can
we use the household income

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.420 align:middle line:90%
account to get to these numbers?

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:53.970 align:middle line:84%
And today I'm in the mood
just to take volunteers.

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:58.470 align:middle line:84%
So would someone like
to take a crack at--

00:04:58.470 --> 00:04:59.670 align:middle line:90%
excuse me-- at that one?

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:15.330 align:middle line:90%


00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:18.840 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: I know
that GDP is the--

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:22.660 align:middle line:84%
it's the sum of the final
goods that are sold.

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:25.868 align:middle line:84%
So it doesn't
include anything that

00:05:25.868 --> 00:05:28.410 align:middle line:84%
is going to be used as an input
for producing something else.

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:33.910 align:middle line:90%


00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:36.220 align:middle line:90%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: That's right.

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:39.740 align:middle line:84%
So GDP is-- we have to
avoid double counting.

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:43.450 align:middle line:84%
So if a firm is
producing something

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:47.170 align:middle line:84%
using capital and
labor and so on,

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:50.410 align:middle line:84%
and it sells that
to another firm,

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:53.030 align:middle line:84%
that becomes an input
in the other firm.

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:55.930 align:middle line:84%
So the danger is
double counting what

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:58.910 align:middle line:84%
is the input in one firm as
the output in the other one.

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:02.030 align:middle line:84%
So what you're referring
to is value added.

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:05.770 align:middle line:84%
So we take output, and
we subtract off payments

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:07.760 align:middle line:90%
to factors--

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:10.720 align:middle line:84%
sorry, subtract off
intermediate goods.

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:14.035 align:middle line:84%
And the rest of it is net
product being produced.

00:06:14.035 --> 00:06:18.762 align:middle line:90%


00:06:18.762 --> 00:06:23.450 align:middle line:84%
Another way to put that is
that, quote, "net product"

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:25.880 align:middle line:84%
at the level of
a given household

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:30.520 align:middle line:84%
should add up to
factor payments,

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:40.560 align:middle line:84%
so namely, wages paid, interest
on capital, rent or interest

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:44.340 align:middle line:90%
if borrowed, and so on.

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:48.530 align:middle line:84%
So I think the hard part of
this question, given that you--

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:52.490 align:middle line:84%
thank you for
volunteering, Armando--

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:55.010 align:middle line:84%
is it's hard to
describe in words

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:58.700 align:middle line:84%
or even remember the details
of the financial accounts.

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:02.540 align:middle line:84%
We started in the lecture
with the income statement

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:07.640 align:middle line:84%
of the household, which
had revenues and costs.

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:12.140 align:middle line:84%
And then we added and subtracted
across the various line items

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:14.910 align:middle line:84%
to produce what
we called product.

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:16.835 align:middle line:84%
So you can go back
and review that.

00:07:16.835 --> 00:07:20.510 align:middle line:90%


00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:22.930 align:middle line:84%
And that's kind of the harder
part to put into words.

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:25.405 align:middle line:84%
I'm not even doing
that well myself.

00:07:25.405 --> 00:07:30.580 align:middle line:90%


00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:32.280 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Can I ask
a quick question?

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:33.450 align:middle line:90%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Sure.

00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:34.470 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:37.200 align:middle line:84%
Can you give us some
specific details

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:42.960 align:middle line:84%
about the difference between
the inventories and imports?

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:49.160 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, maybe inventories--
we calculate the inventories

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:53.030 align:middle line:90%
when we calculate the NIPA.

00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:57.120 align:middle line:90%
But we subtract the inputs.

00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:04.260 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes we-- maybe
some inventories could be

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:07.560 align:middle line:90%
the inputs in the next period.

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:12.420 align:middle line:84%
In this period,
we buy something,

00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:14.290 align:middle line:90%
and we do not use them.

00:08:14.290 --> 00:08:15.810 align:middle line:90%
And so they are not imports.

00:08:15.810 --> 00:08:20.220 align:middle line:84%
But in the next period,
they would be the inputs.

00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:25.290 align:middle line:84%
Then, in the next period,
when we recalculate the NIPA,

00:08:25.290 --> 00:08:28.140 align:middle line:90%
we should subtract this part.

00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:32.475 align:middle line:84%
We should subtract
these inventories.

00:08:32.475 --> 00:08:33.350 align:middle line:90%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yes.

00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:37.460 align:middle line:84%
So you've almost
given the answer.

00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:41.659 align:middle line:84%
We want to keep track of the
difference between buying

00:08:41.659 --> 00:08:43.559 align:middle line:90%
and holding versus using.

00:08:43.559 --> 00:08:49.830 align:middle line:84%
So in the productions, the
income statement and so on,

00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:52.520 align:middle line:84%
we have the cost of
producing something.

00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:55.910 align:middle line:84%
So if they take something
out of inventory

00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:59.750 align:middle line:84%
or buy it on the market,
we value it at the cost

00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:04.330 align:middle line:84%
and have it as part of
the cost of production.

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:06.900 align:middle line:84%
So that's kind of
the flow input.

00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:09.510 align:middle line:84%
Now, if they bought
something on the market

00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:12.900 align:middle line:84%
but didn't utilize it
yet, as in your example,

00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:16.790 align:middle line:84%
then they accumulate
it as inventory.

00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:20.760 align:middle line:84%
And that part is an asset that
appears on the balance sheet.

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:23.400 align:middle line:90%


00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:25.610 align:middle line:84%
So there is a relation
here between the stocks

00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:27.620 align:middle line:90%
and the flows.

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:31.100 align:middle line:84%
And indeed, in the Thai
data, we have all kinds

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:34.250 align:middle line:90%
of inventory accounts.

00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:39.170 align:middle line:84%
We have the rice
that they produced

00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:40.950 align:middle line:90%
and didn't actually sell.

00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:43.430 align:middle line:84%
So we have an output
inventory account.

00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:46.320 align:middle line:84%
We have fertilizer
that they buy,

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:49.200 align:middle line:84%
but they haven't put
on the field yet.

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:51.320 align:middle line:84%
So that's an input
inventory account.

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:54.410 align:middle line:84%
And those things
are not trivial.

00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:56.570 align:middle line:84%
But the inventory
per se is a way

00:09:56.570 --> 00:09:59.165 align:middle line:90%
of carrying value over time.

00:09:59.165 --> 00:10:01.750 align:middle line:90%


00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:02.670 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:05.340 align:middle line:90%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: You're welcome.

00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:05.840 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:08.550 align:middle line:90%


00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:11.100 align:middle line:84%
"How much do villages
differ from one another

00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:14.420 align:middle line:90%
in terms of production."

00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:20.990 align:middle line:84%
And, in particular, "Do villages
vary in the shares of payments

00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:23.620 align:middle line:90%
to factors of production?"

00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:26.270 align:middle line:84%
And, again, today, I'm
just taking volunteers.

00:10:26.270 --> 00:10:28.825 align:middle line:90%


00:10:28.825 --> 00:10:29.450 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:10:29.450 --> 00:10:31.860 align:middle line:90%
I can take this one.

00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:35.450 align:middle line:84%
So I think we had that the ones
that were near the urban area--

00:10:35.450 --> 00:10:36.950 align:middle line:90%
I think that was the center--

00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:40.040 align:middle line:84%
tended to have a lot more
output than the ones that

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:43.820 align:middle line:84%
were in the Northeast, the more
rural and farming villages,

00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:46.130 align:middle line:84%
whereas the central
was more manufacturing.

00:10:46.130 --> 00:10:48.200 align:middle line:84%
And we saw this
difference, I guess,

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:51.620 align:middle line:84%
not only in the value
of their output,

00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:54.470 align:middle line:84%
but also in where
their income went to.

00:10:54.470 --> 00:11:00.950 align:middle line:84%
So I think we had that more went
to capital in the manufacturing

00:11:00.950 --> 00:11:04.010 align:middle line:84%
center areas, and more went
to wages in the rural farming

00:11:04.010 --> 00:11:06.195 align:middle line:90%
areas.

00:11:06.195 --> 00:11:07.070 align:middle line:90%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yes.

00:11:07.070 --> 00:11:07.670 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:14.990 align:middle line:84%
We had wages being relatively
low where labor is abundant.

00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:19.440 align:middle line:84%
That's in the agricultural
northeast part of the country.

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:21.050 align:middle line:90%
And if you look at the share--

00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:23.950 align:middle line:90%


00:11:23.950 --> 00:11:27.020 align:middle line:84%
well, it's a bit tricky because
there's a lot of laborers,

00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:28.190 align:middle line:90%
but the wage is low.

00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:31.430 align:middle line:84%
So you have to multiply
price times quantity.

00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:34.730 align:middle line:84%
And then you get the
share of total income

00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:40.200 align:middle line:84%
in the village which is
attributable to labor.

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:41.580 align:middle line:84%
But you're right
about the factor

00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:48.480 align:middle line:84%
prices and also about
the difference in levels.

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:53.010 align:middle line:84%
Those villages in
regions near Bangkok

00:11:53.010 --> 00:11:56.850 align:middle line:84%
have very high output
levels, or GDP levels,

00:11:56.850 --> 00:11:59.130 align:middle line:84%
relative to villages
in the Northeast.

00:11:59.130 --> 00:12:07.275 align:middle line:90%


00:12:07.275 --> 00:12:07.775 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:12:07.775 --> 00:12:12.890 align:middle line:90%


00:12:12.890 --> 00:12:16.610 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, in the Northeast,
despite the lower wages,

00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:23.450 align:middle line:84%
the share of labor and
income was higher than

00:12:23.450 --> 00:12:24.485 align:middle line:90%
in the central region.

00:12:24.485 --> 00:12:32.000 align:middle line:90%


00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:37.250 align:middle line:84%
And then I'll just ask about
the balance of payments.

00:12:37.250 --> 00:12:39.910 align:middle line:84%
Does someone remember what
the balance of payments

00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:43.405 align:middle line:90%
is for a village or a country?

00:12:43.405 --> 00:12:55.030 align:middle line:90%


00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:58.692 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Would that just
be the various balances of--

00:12:58.692 --> 00:13:00.400 align:middle line:84%
no, that would just
be the balance sheet.

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:01.900 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:05.260 align:middle line:84%
It's not [INAUDIBLE]
the accumulated

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:08.440 align:middle line:84%
assets and liabilities of
everyone added together?

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:10.378 align:middle line:90%
Is that it?

00:13:10.378 --> 00:13:14.430 align:middle line:84%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: It
has to do with trade.

00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:16.480 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Is it a
current account?

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:18.660 align:middle line:90%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yeah.

00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:21.570 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Yeah, it's just
the sum of the trade balance

00:13:21.570 --> 00:13:24.020 align:middle line:90%
and net income transfers.

00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:25.270 align:middle line:90%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: That's right.

00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:30.220 align:middle line:84%
So the balance of payments is
like the current account, which

00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:34.210 align:middle line:84%
is the sum of the trade
balance, exports minus imports,

00:13:34.210 --> 00:13:39.820 align:middle line:84%
plus factor payments coming from
abroad-- incoming remittances

00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:41.920 align:middle line:90%
and gifts and so on.

00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:44.560 align:middle line:84%
So those are the two
components of the flows

00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:49.120 align:middle line:84%
on the left-hand side of the
so-called balance equation,

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:50.380 align:middle line:90%
balance of payments equation.

00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:52.970 align:middle line:90%


00:13:52.970 --> 00:13:56.620 align:middle line:90%
What's on the right hand side?

00:13:56.620 --> 00:13:58.945 align:middle line:84%
The two sides add up and
are equal to each other.

00:13:58.945 --> 00:14:01.480 align:middle line:90%


00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:04.770 align:middle line:84%
What happens if a village
is exporting a lot

00:14:04.770 --> 00:14:08.220 align:middle line:90%
and importing relatively little?

00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:09.360 align:middle line:90%
Where's the money going?

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:17.594 align:middle line:90%


00:14:17.594 --> 00:14:19.762 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: A financial account?

00:14:19.762 --> 00:14:21.970 align:middle line:84%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yeah, it's
in the financial account.

00:14:21.970 --> 00:14:28.690 align:middle line:84%
So, essentially, they're
accumulating deposits

00:14:28.690 --> 00:14:31.300 align:middle line:84%
in commercial banks
outside the village

00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:38.230 align:middle line:84%
or accumulating currency as cash
or, essentially, accumulating

00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:41.130 align:middle line:90%
claims on foreigners.

00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:44.060 align:middle line:84%
So if you export a
lot and import little,

00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:48.390 align:middle line:90%
you have an advantage.

00:14:48.390 --> 00:14:50.490 align:middle line:90%
What did you do with the money?

00:14:50.490 --> 00:14:52.020 align:middle line:90%
You've got to put it somewhere.

00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:54.780 align:middle line:90%


00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:59.040 align:middle line:84%
Or you could have been
indebted externally,

00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:02.520 align:middle line:84%
and then you're going to
repay some of that debt.

00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:05.360 align:middle line:84%
So the claims that
foreigners have on you

00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:06.530 align:middle line:90%
would be diminished.

00:15:06.530 --> 00:15:09.460 align:middle line:90%


00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:11.090 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:15:11.090 --> 00:15:17.100 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to revisit
some of these concepts today.

00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:22.570 align:middle line:90%
So let's start doing that.

00:15:22.570 --> 00:15:28.280 align:middle line:84%
So lecture today, 15, data
and policy in the US--

00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:30.740 align:middle line:84%
and I've mentioned this
before as motivation,

00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:33.830 align:middle line:84%
but here we actually
have the slides--

00:15:33.830 --> 00:15:38.480 align:middle line:84%
something called the China shock
from the standpoint of the US.

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:41.390 align:middle line:84%
And it has to do with
international trade

00:15:41.390 --> 00:15:44.400 align:middle line:84%
and the welfare
gains and losses.

00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:48.920 align:middle line:84%
So economists argue that
trade is a good thing,

00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:50.690 align:middle line:90%
that it improves welfare.

00:15:50.690 --> 00:15:53.870 align:middle line:84%
But we know from
two lectures now--

00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:57.200 align:middle line:84%
the two-by-two theory lecture
as well as the Thai lecture--

00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:00.620 align:middle line:84%
that trade may
redistribute income.

00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:03.620 align:middle line:84%
The idea would be
that the winners

00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:06.110 align:middle line:90%
gain more than the losers lose.

00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:09.660 align:middle line:84%
So, effectively, if you were
to try to add it all up,

00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:13.580 align:middle line:84%
it may appear somehow that
free trade is a good thing.

00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:17.510 align:middle line:84%
But, beneath the surface,
there are winners and losers

00:16:17.510 --> 00:16:21.050 align:middle line:84%
from increasing
foreign competition.

00:16:21.050 --> 00:16:24.590 align:middle line:84%
In some respects, this slide
is an introduction to something

00:16:24.590 --> 00:16:27.740 align:middle line:84%
we're going to do two or
three lectures from now, which

00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:29.690 align:middle line:90%
is to talk about aggregation.

00:16:29.690 --> 00:16:31.460 align:middle line:84%
When we draw those
pictures, we look

00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:34.610 align:middle line:84%
like we have a production
possibilities frontier.

00:16:34.610 --> 00:16:37.910 align:middle line:84%
We have one consumer
with indifference curves.

00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:42.090 align:middle line:84%
It looks like, as you move
from autarky to free trade,

00:16:42.090 --> 00:16:44.130 align:middle line:90%
the consumer is better off.

00:16:44.130 --> 00:16:46.580 align:middle line:84%
But that picture is
implicitly assuming

00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:48.740 align:middle line:84%
that we can aggregate
households up

00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:51.680 align:middle line:84%
so that it appears that
there's just one representative

00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:52.850 align:middle line:90%
household.

00:16:52.850 --> 00:16:57.110 align:middle line:84%
In fact, beneath the surface,
income is getting redistributed

00:16:57.110 --> 00:17:00.570 align:middle line:84%
and some people will
be losing from trade.

00:17:00.570 --> 00:17:03.260 align:middle line:84%
So the movement from
autarky to free trade

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:06.410 align:middle line:84%
is not necessarily Pareto
improving unless you

00:17:06.410 --> 00:17:08.250 align:middle line:90%
compensate the losers.

00:17:08.250 --> 00:17:11.329 align:middle line:84%
So here's the Heckscher-Ohlin
theorem again.

00:17:11.329 --> 00:17:15.349 align:middle line:84%
"Owners of a country's abundant
factors gain from trade,

00:17:15.349 --> 00:17:19.130 align:middle line:84%
but owners of a country's
scarce factors lose."

00:17:19.130 --> 00:17:22.069 align:middle line:84%
So you may remember,
if the country is

00:17:22.069 --> 00:17:26.780 align:middle line:84%
abundant in one of the factors,
then the price of that factor

00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:30.260 align:middle line:90%
tends to be low in autarky.

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:34.250 align:middle line:84%
And that's good for
producing, especially

00:17:34.250 --> 00:17:39.300 align:middle line:84%
for sectors that are relatively
intensive in that factor.

00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:41.840 align:middle line:84%
So when you open the
country up for trade,

00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:44.690 align:middle line:84%
that low price will be
attractive to foreigners.

00:17:44.690 --> 00:17:47.150 align:middle line:90%
The country will be exporting.

00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:52.010 align:middle line:84%
And that, a la
Stolper-Samuelson,

00:17:52.010 --> 00:17:55.640 align:middle line:84%
will raise the price of the
factor that's relatively

00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:58.250 align:middle line:90%
intensive in production.

00:17:58.250 --> 00:18:02.180 align:middle line:84%
But the flip side is the other
factor, the scarce factor,

00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:06.050 align:middle line:84%
will be losing as a
result of free trade.

00:18:06.050 --> 00:18:08.990 align:middle line:84%
The US is abundant
in skilled labor.

00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:11.840 align:middle line:84%
Low-skilled labor is
relatively scarce,

00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:14.610 align:middle line:84%
although not
nonexistent, obviously.

00:18:14.610 --> 00:18:17.930 align:middle line:84%
So when the US opens up to
trade with Mexico and China

00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:23.480 align:middle line:84%
and so on, low-skilled workers
in the US are made worse off.

00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:26.900 align:middle line:84%
And I can't help but say
we're in the midst of the US

00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:30.300 align:middle line:84%
elections, and these
are big issues.

00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:34.140 align:middle line:84%
What happened in the Midwest
in Michigan, Wisconsin,

00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:38.660 align:middle line:84%
Pennsylvania, Ohio, and so on,
referred to as the Rust Belt--

00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:42.890 align:middle line:84%
means they were doing a lot
of manufacturing and so on.

00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:45.890 align:middle line:84%
And the view is that
many of the households

00:18:45.890 --> 00:18:50.440 align:middle line:90%
were hurt by the rise of trade.

00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:56.500 align:middle line:84%
China in particular emerged
as a great international power

00:18:56.500 --> 00:19:00.760 align:middle line:84%
and made very
clear the relevance

00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:04.960 align:middle line:84%
of Heckscher-Ohlin and
Stolper-Samuelson and so on.

00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:08.500 align:middle line:84%
Actually, the slide
is a bit of a rambling

00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:11.560 align:middle line:84%
because it didn't
look, for a long time,

00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:14.080 align:middle line:84%
as if people were
being hurt from trade

00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:17.720 align:middle line:84%
and people were
reconsidering the consensus.

00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:21.790 align:middle line:84%
But now we went right back
to the original underpinnings

00:19:21.790 --> 00:19:23.980 align:middle line:90%
of the theory.

00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:29.040 align:middle line:84%
In particular, these trade
shocks that originate in China

00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:33.300 align:middle line:84%
have impacted industries,
plants, and local labor markets

00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:34.680 align:middle line:90%
across the US.

00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:37.180 align:middle line:84%
I'll show you a
picture momentarily.

00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:40.060 align:middle line:84%
So we want to estimate
the gains from trade.

00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:44.130 align:middle line:84%
We also want to
document the losses that

00:19:44.130 --> 00:19:47.070 align:middle line:90%
also arise under free trade.

00:19:47.070 --> 00:19:50.250 align:middle line:84%
And we want to quantify who's
winning and who's losing.

00:19:50.250 --> 00:19:53.040 align:middle line:84%
That was the theme
of the Thai lecture

00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:57.930 align:middle line:84%
last time, to distinguish
labor from capital,

00:19:57.930 --> 00:20:01.560 align:middle line:84%
one village from another,
changing the prices,

00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:04.000 align:middle line:90%
the relative prices of goods.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.150 align:middle line:90%
And we did counterfactuals--

00:20:06.150 --> 00:20:08.400 align:middle line:84%
what if they hadn't
become more liberal,

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:11.800 align:middle line:84%
what if we imposed a tax
on imports, and so on.

00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:16.530 align:middle line:84%
And we were documenting
how the incidents could

00:20:16.530 --> 00:20:18.330 align:middle line:84%
be good or bad,
depending on wealth

00:20:18.330 --> 00:20:20.508 align:middle line:90%
and talent of the households.

00:20:20.508 --> 00:20:22.050 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to
try to do something

00:20:22.050 --> 00:20:24.420 align:middle line:84%
like that momentarily
for the US.

00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:26.610 align:middle line:90%
Here is a picture of China--

00:20:26.610 --> 00:20:30.510 align:middle line:84%
share of world
manufacturing value added.

00:20:30.510 --> 00:20:34.140 align:middle line:84%
We talked about value added a
minute ago, the blue line going

00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:36.990 align:middle line:90%
up steadily over the decades--

00:20:36.990 --> 00:20:41.340 align:middle line:84%
20 years approximately--
and China's share of world

00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:42.860 align:middle line:90%
manufacturing exports.

00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:44.430 align:middle line:84%
So not only are
they producing more,

00:20:44.430 --> 00:20:48.300 align:middle line:84%
they're exporting it,
also on the steady rise.

00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:51.360 align:middle line:84%
And here's a picture of
the US current account.

00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:54.660 align:middle line:84%
We reviewed the definition
of this just a moment ago,

00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:58.180 align:middle line:84%
the trade balance plus
incoming remittances.

00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:01.500 align:middle line:84%
The current account
in the US is negative

00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:05.040 align:middle line:84%
and got increasingly negative
at exactly the same time

00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:07.680 align:middle line:84%
that China's current
account was positive

00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:11.760 align:middle line:84%
and increasing,
peaking, say, in 2005.

00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:16.830 align:middle line:84%
Now, this picture probably
includes the overall US current

00:21:16.830 --> 00:21:20.040 align:middle line:84%
account, not only with China,
but with other countries,

00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:21.630 align:middle line:90%
and likewise for China.

00:21:21.630 --> 00:21:25.410 align:middle line:84%
But for all the world, it
looks very bilateral here.

00:21:25.410 --> 00:21:27.660 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, a big part
of what's happening

00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:29.640 align:middle line:84%
to the trade balance
in the US has

00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:33.810 align:middle line:84%
to do with China,
and vice versa.

00:21:33.810 --> 00:21:37.810 align:middle line:84%
And then here's a picture
of the US by state.

00:21:37.810 --> 00:21:41.160 align:middle line:84%
And this is from that Autor,
Dorn, and Hanson reference

00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:43.300 align:middle line:90%
about four slides ago.

00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:48.750 align:middle line:84%
So they looked at the
composition of Chinese imports

00:21:48.750 --> 00:21:53.430 align:middle line:84%
into the US by sector
and looked at where

00:21:53.430 --> 00:21:59.640 align:middle line:84%
those goods had been produced
previously by county in the US.

00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:02.430 align:middle line:84%
And these dark
areas are the areas

00:22:02.430 --> 00:22:04.320 align:middle line:84%
that are most
vulnerable in the sense

00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:07.170 align:middle line:84%
that they had been
producing things that

00:22:07.170 --> 00:22:09.030 align:middle line:90%
are now imported from China.

00:22:09.030 --> 00:22:11.370 align:middle line:90%
That doesn't mean in that state.

00:22:11.370 --> 00:22:14.190 align:middle line:90%
It means for the US in general.

00:22:14.190 --> 00:22:18.300 align:middle line:84%
So Chinese imports are
bought by consumers

00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:20.910 align:middle line:84%
all over the United
States, which

00:22:20.910 --> 00:22:25.410 align:middle line:84%
means that a state, like a big
chunk of Tennessee, if you can

00:22:25.410 --> 00:22:29.430 align:middle line:84%
see it there, which had
been producing manufactured

00:22:29.430 --> 00:22:32.400 align:middle line:84%
goods now being
imported from China,

00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:36.370 align:middle line:84%
itself would be exporting less
to other states in the United

00:22:36.370 --> 00:22:38.640 align:middle line:84%
States because
it's not producing.

00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:42.150 align:middle line:84%
Those other states are buying
it directly from China.

00:22:42.150 --> 00:22:43.350 align:middle line:90%
Anyway, it's kind of spotty.

00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:46.020 align:middle line:84%
But you can see it's
certainly not universal.

00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:49.810 align:middle line:84%
And here's a measure of the
current account, the trade

00:22:49.810 --> 00:22:53.680 align:middle line:90%
balances plus net remittances.

00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:57.490 align:middle line:84%
But this treats a state
in the United States

00:22:57.490 --> 00:22:58.660 align:middle line:90%
as a whole country.

00:22:58.660 --> 00:23:00.815 align:middle line:84%
Or another way to
put it-- it treats

00:23:00.815 --> 00:23:02.440 align:middle line:84%
the states in the
United States the way

00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:06.130 align:middle line:84%
we were considering
villages in Thailand.

00:23:06.130 --> 00:23:10.000 align:middle line:84%
So you can see here that the
current account, the scale

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.070 align:middle line:90%
that's down here, is positive.

00:23:12.070 --> 00:23:15.850 align:middle line:84%
So these are net
exporting states.

00:23:15.850 --> 00:23:19.780 align:middle line:84%
And the red, dark orange
colors are, quote,

00:23:19.780 --> 00:23:21.980 align:middle line:90%
"net importing" states.

00:23:21.980 --> 00:23:25.570 align:middle line:84%
So here's a review of
those equations again.

00:23:25.570 --> 00:23:29.230 align:middle line:84%
The current account consists
of the trade balance

00:23:29.230 --> 00:23:33.780 align:middle line:84%
and net incoming
transfers of income.

00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:35.970 align:middle line:84%
The trade balance is
itself the difference

00:23:35.970 --> 00:23:38.310 align:middle line:90%
between exports and imports.

00:23:38.310 --> 00:23:44.170 align:middle line:84%
Net income transfers consist of
private and public transfers.

00:23:44.170 --> 00:23:48.840 align:middle line:84%
So in the US, for example,
there's a lot of taxes

00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:51.420 align:middle line:90%
and a lot of welfare programs.

00:23:51.420 --> 00:23:54.690 align:middle line:84%
So, actually, a big part
of the state's income

00:23:54.690 --> 00:23:59.040 align:middle line:84%
is attributable to
net public transfers.

00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:02.520 align:middle line:84%
But that's not the only
source of transfers.

00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:06.660 align:middle line:84%
There are gifts and
remittances across states.

00:24:06.660 --> 00:24:08.760 align:middle line:90%
Now, how does one get at that?

00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:15.240 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's gross state income
versus gross state product.

00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:17.580 align:middle line:84%
The product we talked
about earlier--

00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:21.540 align:middle line:84%
10 minutes ago-- means that
it is produced in the state,

00:24:21.540 --> 00:24:24.910 align:middle line:84%
hiring capital and
labor and so on.

00:24:24.910 --> 00:24:28.830 align:middle line:84%
But their gross state income
on the income statement

00:24:28.830 --> 00:24:31.500 align:middle line:84%
of households would
include income

00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:36.090 align:middle line:84%
that they earned in other states
or that other household members

00:24:36.090 --> 00:24:40.000 align:middle line:84%
earned in other states and sent
back home to the home state.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.870 align:middle line:90%
Fortunately, the US measures--

00:24:42.870 --> 00:24:46.110 align:middle line:84%
the Bureau of Economic Analysis
measures both gross state

00:24:46.110 --> 00:24:48.000 align:middle line:90%
income and gross state product.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:52.440 align:middle line:84%
We take the difference of those,
and we have net transfers.

00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:54.640 align:middle line:84%
And then, finally,
the current account,

00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:57.060 align:middle line:84%
which is, again the trade
balance and net income

00:24:57.060 --> 00:25:00.870 align:middle line:84%
transfers on the
left, is balanced

00:25:00.870 --> 00:25:03.580 align:middle line:90%
by claims on other states.

00:25:03.580 --> 00:25:04.890 align:middle line:90%
So this is what I asked about.

00:25:04.890 --> 00:25:07.740 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm going to show you
a lot of data momentarily.

00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:11.400 align:middle line:84%
But this equation is kind
of making some assumptions.

00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:14.700 align:middle line:84%
Namely, it's assuming
that the financial part

00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:18.510 align:middle line:84%
of the adjustment has to do with
the transection of the given

00:25:18.510 --> 00:25:20.050 align:middle line:90%
state with other states--

00:25:20.050 --> 00:25:23.890 align:middle line:84%
for example, trading in
stocks and bonds and so on.

00:25:23.890 --> 00:25:26.040 align:middle line:90%
So that's the part we want.

00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:30.690 align:middle line:84%
What we don't want is state
investment in the capital stock

00:25:30.690 --> 00:25:33.180 align:middle line:84%
or housing investment,
because those

00:25:33.180 --> 00:25:36.160 align:middle line:90%
are internal within the state.

00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:39.600 align:middle line:84%
So to get the change on
claims in foreigners,

00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:42.270 align:middle line:84%
we take the change in
net worth, and then

00:25:42.270 --> 00:25:44.730 align:middle line:84%
subtract off how
much of that shows up

00:25:44.730 --> 00:25:47.550 align:middle line:84%
as increased investment
in capital and housing,

00:25:47.550 --> 00:25:53.040 align:middle line:84%
and assume the rest of it is
an increase in financial claims

00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:54.390 align:middle line:90%
on foreign--

00:25:54.390 --> 00:25:57.570 align:middle line:84%
I want to say foreign
states, on other states.

00:25:57.570 --> 00:26:00.940 align:middle line:84%
And we'll see how well
this works out momentarily.

00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:02.220 align:middle line:90%
So what data?

00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:07.860 align:middle line:84%
Well, in the US, you have to be
diligent and creative to begin

00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:10.830 align:middle line:84%
to measure the
various components.

00:26:10.830 --> 00:26:12.480 align:middle line:90%
So I won't dwell on this.

00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:15.500 align:middle line:84%
But, fortunately, there is
something called the commodity

00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:20.150 align:middle line:84%
flow survey, which measures
trade flows across states

00:26:20.150 --> 00:26:22.760 align:middle line:84%
in the United States,
interstate trade.

00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:24.830 align:middle line:84%
The growth state
income and product

00:26:24.830 --> 00:26:29.150 align:middle line:84%
comes from BEA
regional accounts,

00:26:29.150 --> 00:26:31.460 align:middle line:90%
as does public transfers.

00:26:31.460 --> 00:26:34.250 align:middle line:84%
These measures incidence
of the China shock,

00:26:34.250 --> 00:26:37.580 align:middle line:84%
I already showed you from
Autor, Dorn, and Hanson.

00:26:37.580 --> 00:26:39.170 align:middle line:90%
And we have those from David.

00:26:39.170 --> 00:26:42.830 align:middle line:84%
Housing stock comes from
American Community Survey.

00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:45.170 align:middle line:90%
We have a price index.

00:26:45.170 --> 00:26:49.880 align:middle line:84%
The socks and bonds
transactions are tough to get.

00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:53.360 align:middle line:84%
But we have indirect
access to IRS data

00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:56.340 align:middle line:84%
where people report
dividends and so on.

00:26:56.340 --> 00:26:58.700 align:middle line:84%
And you can kind of back
out what their ownership

00:26:58.700 --> 00:27:01.790 align:middle line:84%
is of the assets from how
much interest earnings

00:27:01.790 --> 00:27:03.620 align:middle line:90%
and so on that they report.

00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:06.170 align:middle line:84%
The capital stock
is also hard to get.

00:27:06.170 --> 00:27:07.490 align:middle line:90%
I'm not saying much about it.

00:27:07.490 --> 00:27:11.480 align:middle line:84%
Household debt is pretty well
measured in the New York Fed

00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:16.280 align:middle line:84%
CCP, Consumer Credit Panel,
which is Equifax credit

00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:18.210 align:middle line:90%
card-type data.

00:27:18.210 --> 00:27:19.880 align:middle line:90%
So what is this not?

00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:21.680 align:middle line:90%
It's not like Thailand.

00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:24.480 align:middle line:90%
And I keep coming back to this.

00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:27.380 align:middle line:84%
It's not like we're on
the ground measuring

00:27:27.380 --> 00:27:30.670 align:middle line:84%
the income statement, the
balance sheet, cash flow and so

00:27:30.670 --> 00:27:31.170 align:middle line:90%
on.

00:27:31.170 --> 00:27:33.950 align:middle line:84%
Instead, we have to use
the best available data

00:27:33.950 --> 00:27:36.590 align:middle line:84%
in the US, which is
different variables coming

00:27:36.590 --> 00:27:38.120 align:middle line:90%
from different sources.

00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:41.210 align:middle line:84%
Although the accounting
equations should still be true,

00:27:41.210 --> 00:27:44.900 align:middle line:84%
the way that we're measuring
the variables is different.

00:27:44.900 --> 00:27:47.870 align:middle line:84%
So what's the impact
of the China shock?

00:27:47.870 --> 00:27:51.770 align:middle line:84%
We use the accounting identity
I just showed you, technically

00:27:51.770 --> 00:27:54.500 align:middle line:84%
called "seemingly
unrelated regressions,"

00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:57.290 align:middle line:84%
we could regress the trade
balance on the China shock.

00:27:57.290 --> 00:28:00.830 align:middle line:84%
We can regress gifts and
remittances on the China shock.

00:28:00.830 --> 00:28:03.800 align:middle line:84%
If that accounting
identity is true,

00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:06.920 align:middle line:84%
there is some relationship
across those seemingly

00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:10.010 align:middle line:84%
separately estimated
regressions.

00:28:10.010 --> 00:28:14.570 align:middle line:84%
And so this technique is a
way to do it jointly and take

00:28:14.570 --> 00:28:17.310 align:middle line:84%
into account the
accounting identity.

00:28:17.310 --> 00:28:20.210 align:middle line:84%
So we take, say--
let me skip down

00:28:20.210 --> 00:28:22.190 align:middle line:90%
here-- a 10-year difference.

00:28:22.190 --> 00:28:24.110 align:middle line:84%
You can think of
this conceptually

00:28:24.110 --> 00:28:27.710 align:middle line:84%
as comparing states hit by the
Chinese shock, states which

00:28:27.710 --> 00:28:30.200 align:middle line:84%
have not been hit
by the China shock,

00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:33.710 align:middle line:84%
and then comparing what's going
on with their trade balance.

00:28:33.710 --> 00:28:37.190 align:middle line:84%
The impact on the trade
balance is negative.

00:28:37.190 --> 00:28:39.200 align:middle line:84%
That is to say it's
an adverse shock.

00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:41.840 align:middle line:84%
The impact on the current
account is negative--

00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:43.760 align:middle line:90%
also an adverse shock.

00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:47.300 align:middle line:84%
Impact on transfers
is positive, but not

00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:49.850 align:middle line:84%
enough to overcome the
difference in the trade

00:28:49.850 --> 00:28:50.810 align:middle line:90%
balance.

00:28:50.810 --> 00:28:53.450 align:middle line:84%
And we can break
it down further.

00:28:53.450 --> 00:28:59.060 align:middle line:84%
Exports-- a state specialized
in manufactured goods now

00:28:59.060 --> 00:29:03.530 align:middle line:84%
competing with China, exports
of that state to other states

00:29:03.530 --> 00:29:04.820 align:middle line:90%
goes down.

00:29:04.820 --> 00:29:08.340 align:middle line:84%
Imports don't seem
to move very much.

00:29:08.340 --> 00:29:10.340 align:middle line:90%
They're not importing less.

00:29:10.340 --> 00:29:14.120 align:middle line:84%
Public transfers, ironically,
over a 10-year period,

00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:15.860 align:middle line:90%
don't move much.

00:29:15.860 --> 00:29:20.780 align:middle line:84%
But private transfers, quite
interestingly, are positive.

00:29:20.780 --> 00:29:23.300 align:middle line:90%
So this is a pretty new finding.

00:29:23.300 --> 00:29:25.020 align:middle line:90%
We haven't published it yet.

00:29:25.020 --> 00:29:28.130 align:middle line:84%
But it should remind you
a little bit about gift

00:29:28.130 --> 00:29:29.870 align:middle line:90%
giving in Thai villages.

00:29:29.870 --> 00:29:32.330 align:middle line:84%
We talked about them
helping each other out

00:29:32.330 --> 00:29:33.590 align:middle line:90%
from various shocks.

00:29:33.590 --> 00:29:35.720 align:middle line:84%
These states, obviously,
quote unquote,

00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:38.060 align:middle line:84%
"help each other
out" in the sense

00:29:38.060 --> 00:29:41.390 align:middle line:84%
that they get incoming
gifts and remittances

00:29:41.390 --> 00:29:45.140 align:middle line:84%
and factor payments
precisely when they need it

00:29:45.140 --> 00:29:47.510 align:middle line:84%
when they're in trouble
because they've been hit

00:29:47.510 --> 00:29:50.130 align:middle line:90%
by a long-term adverse shock.

00:29:50.130 --> 00:29:52.550 align:middle line:84%
So that's kind of the, quote
unquote, "left-hand side"

00:29:52.550 --> 00:29:54.060 align:middle line:90%
of the equation.

00:29:54.060 --> 00:29:56.490 align:middle line:84%
Now we can turn to
the right-hand side,

00:29:56.490 --> 00:30:01.320 align:middle line:84%
which is adjustments in
physical and financial capital.

00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:03.050 align:middle line:90%
And we don't find much.

00:30:03.050 --> 00:30:06.560 align:middle line:84%
Housing actually went up,
which is counterintuitive.

00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:09.950 align:middle line:84%
And the rest of the
variables are insignificant.

00:30:09.950 --> 00:30:12.980 align:middle line:84%
Now, this violates the
accounting identity.

00:30:12.980 --> 00:30:16.370 align:middle line:84%
Something on the right-hand
side has to move.

00:30:16.370 --> 00:30:18.710 align:middle line:84%
But, because we've
been using data

00:30:18.710 --> 00:30:20.210 align:middle line:84%
from all these
different sources,

00:30:20.210 --> 00:30:24.470 align:middle line:84%
as well as assuming that we have
a way of measuring decreased

00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:29.240 align:middle line:84%
claims on other states, we're
just not doing good enough.

00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:31.260 align:middle line:84%
It's not a comment
on our techniques.

00:30:31.260 --> 00:30:34.430 align:middle line:84%
It's a comment on both the
data sources as well as

00:30:34.430 --> 00:30:35.480 align:middle line:90%
this assumption.

00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:38.120 align:middle line:84%
And I'll keep
coming back to that.

00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:42.740 align:middle line:84%
In particular, how do we measure
wealth and income in the US?

00:30:42.740 --> 00:30:45.200 align:middle line:84%
Our measure of wealth
on the right-hand side

00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:47.420 align:middle line:90%
isn't working very well.

00:30:47.420 --> 00:30:51.020 align:middle line:84%
It is supposed to be aggregated
up at the state level.

00:30:51.020 --> 00:30:54.170 align:middle line:84%
But, within a state,
there's arguably a lot

00:30:54.170 --> 00:30:56.450 align:middle line:84%
of heterogeneity,
which is kind of why

00:30:56.450 --> 00:30:59.780 align:middle line:84%
we reviewed what way villages
differ from one another

00:30:59.780 --> 00:31:02.630 align:middle line:84%
and households within villages
differ from one another.

00:31:02.630 --> 00:31:05.000 align:middle line:84%
And surely within
a state in the US,

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.250 align:middle line:84%
you see rich people
and poor people.

00:31:07.250 --> 00:31:09.300 align:middle line:84%
You see a lot of
different wealth groups.

00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:12.110 align:middle line:84%
So the low-wealth
group would correspond

00:31:12.110 --> 00:31:15.290 align:middle line:84%
with low-wealth workers
who rely on wages,

00:31:15.290 --> 00:31:21.050 align:middle line:84%
and hopefully, on pensions,
versus the higher-wealth people

00:31:21.050 --> 00:31:24.470 align:middle line:84%
within a state which
typically have income

00:31:24.470 --> 00:31:26.460 align:middle line:90%
from their business.

00:31:26.460 --> 00:31:29.840 align:middle line:84%
So when we aggregate
up to the whole state,

00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:32.930 align:middle line:84%
we're not able to
make this distinction.

00:31:32.930 --> 00:31:35.480 align:middle line:90%
So that's one potential problem.

00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:37.280 align:middle line:84%
Some households'
financial assets

00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:38.900 align:middle line:84%
are going in one
direction as they're

00:31:38.900 --> 00:31:42.410 align:middle line:84%
benefited, others going
in the opposite direction

00:31:42.410 --> 00:31:43.680 align:middle line:90%
as they're harmed.

00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:46.610 align:middle line:84%
And we take the net difference,
and we're having trouble

00:31:46.610 --> 00:31:47.540 align:middle line:90%
finding something.

00:31:47.540 --> 00:31:51.090 align:middle line:84%
That's one plausible
explanation.

00:31:51.090 --> 00:31:54.080 align:middle line:84%
The other is the way the data
are collected to begin with.

00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:58.340 align:middle line:84%
The Federal Reserve is
constructing Flow of Funds,

00:31:58.340 --> 00:32:00.950 align:middle line:84%
changing the balance
sheet, and using

00:32:00.950 --> 00:32:04.280 align:middle line:84%
a survey called the Survey
of Consumer Finances.

00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:06.350 align:middle line:84%
And it does a really
wonderful job.

00:32:06.350 --> 00:32:08.360 align:middle line:84%
These are really
important measurements.

00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:12.860 align:middle line:84%
People use the Flow of Funds and
the Survey of Consumer Finances

00:32:12.860 --> 00:32:16.250 align:middle line:84%
all the time for
US data analysis,

00:32:16.250 --> 00:32:22.070 align:middle line:84%
although it's not really
available at a regional level,

00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:24.290 align:middle line:84%
and certainly not at
the level of states.

00:32:24.290 --> 00:32:28.050 align:middle line:84%
They don't gather it that way,
and they won't release it.

00:32:28.050 --> 00:32:29.450 align:middle line:90%
Believe me, I've tried.

00:32:29.450 --> 00:32:32.820 align:middle line:84%
The flip side are the
flows from the Bureau

00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:34.140 align:middle line:90%
of Economic Analysis.

00:32:34.140 --> 00:32:36.360 align:middle line:84%
And they do a great job,
too, as I've already

00:32:36.360 --> 00:32:39.150 align:middle line:84%
said, measuring
income and product,

00:32:39.150 --> 00:32:43.020 align:middle line:84%
not only at the state level, but
at the level of municipalities

00:32:43.020 --> 00:32:45.730 align:middle line:84%
and centers,
districts, and so on.

00:32:45.730 --> 00:32:47.880 align:middle line:84%
The problem is these
different agencies

00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:50.820 align:middle line:84%
are doing a good job with
the thing under their domain.

00:32:50.820 --> 00:32:52.020 align:middle line:90%
But they have no--

00:32:52.020 --> 00:32:54.570 align:middle line:84%
the Federal Reserve is not
collecting income data,

00:32:54.570 --> 00:32:58.930 align:middle line:84%
and the BEA is not collecting
asset or wealth data.

00:32:58.930 --> 00:33:03.000 align:middle line:84%
So the wealth changes
and the income changes

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:05.700 align:middle line:84%
are not consistent
with one another.

00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:10.980 align:middle line:84%
They're not using the logic
of the accounting identities

00:33:10.980 --> 00:33:13.530 align:middle line:90%
that we've been emphasizing.

00:33:13.530 --> 00:33:15.620 align:middle line:90%
What identity?

00:33:15.620 --> 00:33:19.640 align:middle line:84%
Namely, when you have,
say, positive savings--

00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:22.760 align:middle line:84%
that's a flow-- what are
they doing with that saving?

00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:25.130 align:middle line:84%
That should show up
as a change in wealth,

00:33:25.130 --> 00:33:28.580 align:middle line:84%
a change in real or financial
assets in the balance sheet,

00:33:28.580 --> 00:33:30.680 align:middle line:84%
at least adjusting
for capital gains.

00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:33.540 align:middle line:84%
The balance sheet can go up
or down with the stock market.

00:33:33.540 --> 00:33:34.650 align:middle line:90%
You don't want that.

00:33:34.650 --> 00:33:37.010 align:middle line:84%
So you take out those
price movements,

00:33:37.010 --> 00:33:40.220 align:middle line:84%
and you're left with real
balance sheet items that

00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:43.400 align:middle line:84%
have to move in the sense
of an accounting identity

00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:45.570 align:middle line:90%
with savings.

00:33:45.570 --> 00:33:48.140 align:middle line:84%
But they don't, in the
data, because the data

00:33:48.140 --> 00:33:51.980 align:middle line:84%
aren't measured through the
lens of the accounting identity.

00:33:51.980 --> 00:33:55.220 align:middle line:84%
Unlike what we showed
you for Thailand,

00:33:55.220 --> 00:33:57.440 align:middle line:84%
where we collected
the data at the level

00:33:57.440 --> 00:33:59.600 align:middle line:84%
of individual
households and firms,

00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:01.560 align:middle line:84%
where we had the income,
the balance sheet,

00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:06.620 align:middle line:84%
and so on for each one of them,
the income and balance sheet

00:34:06.620 --> 00:34:09.139 align:middle line:84%
have to be consistent
with one another.

00:34:09.139 --> 00:34:12.170 align:middle line:84%
In the US, we have these
well-known surveys.

00:34:12.170 --> 00:34:15.228 align:middle line:84%
I've already mentioned the
Survey of Consumer Finances

00:34:15.228 --> 00:34:16.520 align:middle line:90%
from the Federal Reserve Board.

00:34:16.520 --> 00:34:19.639 align:middle line:84%
We have the Consumer Expenditure
Survey, the Panel Study

00:34:19.639 --> 00:34:22.250 align:middle line:90%
of Income Dynamics, and others.

00:34:22.250 --> 00:34:26.630 align:middle line:84%
So I'm showing you a
balance sheet constructed

00:34:26.630 --> 00:34:28.730 align:middle line:90%
by each one of these surveys.

00:34:28.730 --> 00:34:32.210 align:middle line:84%
These items should
start to seem familiar.

00:34:32.210 --> 00:34:34.550 align:middle line:90%
You've got current assets--

00:34:34.550 --> 00:34:39.840 align:middle line:84%
namely cash, bank accounts,
certificates of deposit,

00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:40.920 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:43.370 align:middle line:90%
So, say, the median level--

00:34:43.370 --> 00:34:46.909 align:middle line:84%
$422,000 depending
on the survey--

00:34:46.909 --> 00:34:51.980 align:middle line:84%
it's only $226,000 in the
survey of consumer finances.

00:34:51.980 --> 00:34:55.489 align:middle line:84%
It's $600,000-- the
different surveys

00:34:55.489 --> 00:34:56.760 align:middle line:90%
measure different things.

00:34:56.760 --> 00:34:59.570 align:middle line:90%
So that's one problem.

00:34:59.570 --> 00:35:01.730 align:middle line:84%
But also, we have
physical investments

00:35:01.730 --> 00:35:06.690 align:middle line:84%
down here, business assets,
housing assets, and so on.

00:35:06.690 --> 00:35:09.740 align:middle line:84%
So this should be reminding
you of the balance

00:35:09.740 --> 00:35:12.050 align:middle line:90%
sheets for the Thai households.

00:35:12.050 --> 00:35:15.860 align:middle line:84%
After all, the concept of a
balance sheet is quite general.

00:35:15.860 --> 00:35:18.600 align:middle line:84%
It's just a matter of
where you're applying it.

00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:21.140 align:middle line:84%
However, this is not one
particular household.

00:35:21.140 --> 00:35:23.900 align:middle line:84%
This is the median
or average level,

00:35:23.900 --> 00:35:27.830 align:middle line:84%
that sort of synthesized
or synthetic balance

00:35:27.830 --> 00:35:31.730 align:middle line:84%
sheet that's created for
each and all of these surveys

00:35:31.730 --> 00:35:33.140 align:middle line:90%
individually.

00:35:33.140 --> 00:35:36.020 align:middle line:84%
And you can get the
income statement.

00:35:36.020 --> 00:35:40.970 align:middle line:84%
An aggregate version from the
PSID, the Consumer Expenditure

00:35:40.970 --> 00:35:42.380 align:middle line:90%
Survey, and so on--

00:35:42.380 --> 00:35:49.130 align:middle line:84%
median income in the US,
roughly $67,000, $65,000,

00:35:49.130 --> 00:35:55.190 align:middle line:84%
$83,000, $70,000 et cetera,
coming from labor income,

00:35:55.190 --> 00:36:00.260 align:middle line:84%
production income, other income,
including interest dividends,

00:36:00.260 --> 00:36:02.400 align:middle line:90%
government transfers.

00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:03.810 align:middle line:90%
And we have expenditures.

00:36:03.810 --> 00:36:08.040 align:middle line:84%
So expenditures would not only
be depreciation and so on.

00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:10.670 align:middle line:90%
But it would include taxes.

00:36:10.670 --> 00:36:12.620 align:middle line:84%
And the way we do the
accounting in Thailand,

00:36:12.620 --> 00:36:14.820 align:middle line:90%
we have consumption over here.

00:36:14.820 --> 00:36:17.360 align:middle line:84%
So, basically,
that's an outflow.

00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:21.680 align:middle line:84%
We had net profits taking
revenue minus expenses.

00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:24.920 align:middle line:84%
And from the net profits,
if it were positive,

00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:28.370 align:middle line:84%
we would have savings
and consumption.

00:36:28.370 --> 00:36:30.110 align:middle line:90%
So consumption is not included.

00:36:30.110 --> 00:36:32.090 align:middle line:90%
That's why it's in red here.

00:36:32.090 --> 00:36:35.930 align:middle line:84%
But it is in the
Statement of Cash Flows.

00:36:35.930 --> 00:36:38.390 align:middle line:84%
And here's the
Statement of Cash Flows

00:36:38.390 --> 00:36:40.700 align:middle line:90%
for each one of those surveys--

00:36:40.700 --> 00:36:43.010 align:middle line:84%
cash flow from
production, cash flow

00:36:43.010 --> 00:36:46.580 align:middle line:84%
from consumption,
from investment,

00:36:46.580 --> 00:36:49.160 align:middle line:90%
cash flow from financing.

00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:50.870 align:middle line:84%
We introduced a
cash flow statement

00:36:50.870 --> 00:36:54.290 align:middle line:84%
way back when we
talked about Bitcoin.

00:36:54.290 --> 00:36:57.020 align:middle line:84%
We had transfer of
Bitcoin accounts.

00:36:57.020 --> 00:37:00.740 align:middle line:84%
I made the point that both the
balance sheet and the cash flow

00:37:00.740 --> 00:37:03.680 align:middle line:84%
were being represented
in the same ledger.

00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:05.240 align:middle line:84%
You had to own it
before you could

00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:07.970 align:middle line:90%
buy it-- use it to buy things.

00:37:07.970 --> 00:37:12.890 align:middle line:84%
Relatedly, the change in cash
flow in Bitcoin should be--

00:37:12.890 --> 00:37:16.550 align:middle line:84%
if it's outgoing, should be
associated with a decrease

00:37:16.550 --> 00:37:18.680 align:middle line:90%
in the ownership of the coin.

00:37:18.680 --> 00:37:21.410 align:middle line:84%
Or more generally, in
the accounting sense,

00:37:21.410 --> 00:37:24.500 align:middle line:84%
the change in cash in the
statement of cash flow

00:37:24.500 --> 00:37:27.200 align:middle line:84%
should be the same
as the change in cash

00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:28.670 align:middle line:90%
holding in the balance sheet.

00:37:28.670 --> 00:37:30.660 align:middle line:90%
It seems pretty natural.

00:37:30.660 --> 00:37:34.220 align:middle line:84%
And if you collect the data from
scratch, each entity, one at

00:37:34.220 --> 00:37:36.200 align:middle line:84%
a time, you can run
this check and make

00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:38.930 align:middle line:84%
sure it's true if you're using
the accounting framework.

00:37:38.930 --> 00:37:40.730 align:middle line:84%
If not, then you
did something wrong,

00:37:40.730 --> 00:37:42.320 align:middle line:90%
and you have to start over.

00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:45.830 align:middle line:84%
The US data are not
collected in that way.

00:37:45.830 --> 00:37:48.170 align:middle line:90%
Nobody ever ran this check.

00:37:48.170 --> 00:37:50.840 align:middle line:84%
So I did it with
Scott Schuh and Chris.

00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:53.930 align:middle line:84%
And here you can see
a big discrepancy

00:37:53.930 --> 00:37:56.210 align:middle line:84%
between the change
in the cash flow

00:37:56.210 --> 00:37:59.540 align:middle line:84%
from the statement of cash
flow and the change in cash

00:37:59.540 --> 00:38:02.120 align:middle line:84%
as measured on the change
in the balance sheet.

00:38:02.120 --> 00:38:04.590 align:middle line:90%
How big are these numbers?

00:38:04.590 --> 00:38:08.210 align:middle line:84%
Well, the percent
normalized by current assets

00:38:08.210 --> 00:38:12.665 align:middle line:90%
is anywhere from 16 to 37%.

00:38:12.665 --> 00:38:13.640 align:middle line:90%
It's huge.

00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:15.980 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
something is wrong.

00:38:15.980 --> 00:38:17.900 align:middle line:84%
The flows aren't
measured properly,

00:38:17.900 --> 00:38:20.330 align:middle line:84%
or the assets are not
measured properly.

00:38:20.330 --> 00:38:21.530 align:middle line:90%
Does it really matter?

00:38:21.530 --> 00:38:23.180 align:middle line:90%
Can we wave our hands.

00:38:23.180 --> 00:38:26.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, we tried to use
the data that we have.

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:32.310 align:middle line:84%
But we could be off by as much
as 37% on the balance sheet.

00:38:32.310 --> 00:38:36.320 align:middle line:84%
So this is the sad state
of affairs for US data.

00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:38.390 align:middle line:84%
Although I must say each
one of these surveys

00:38:38.390 --> 00:38:40.670 align:middle line:84%
is really fantastic,
it was never

00:38:40.670 --> 00:38:43.183 align:middle line:84%
designed with the accounting
framework in mind.

00:38:43.183 --> 00:38:44.600 align:middle line:84%
And they're very
good at measuring

00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:46.760 align:middle line:90%
what they intended to do.

00:38:46.760 --> 00:38:50.750 align:middle line:84%
But, on the other hand,
they never ran this check.

00:38:50.750 --> 00:38:54.710 align:middle line:84%
So the notion that the
change in the balance

00:38:54.710 --> 00:38:58.340 align:middle line:84%
sheet and the income statement
ought to be consistent

00:38:58.340 --> 00:38:59.910 align:middle line:90%
is not new.

00:38:59.910 --> 00:39:02.060 align:middle line:90%
It comes with the accounts.

00:39:02.060 --> 00:39:05.180 align:middle line:84%
And there is something in the
US called integrated macro

00:39:05.180 --> 00:39:10.010 align:middle line:84%
accounts, which is exactly what
it is-- accounts integrated

00:39:10.010 --> 00:39:11.400 align:middle line:90%
with each other.

00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:17.120 align:middle line:84%
So this unusual cooperation
between the Federal Reserve

00:39:17.120 --> 00:39:21.980 align:middle line:84%
Board and the BEA tried to
pool the data that each has,

00:39:21.980 --> 00:39:24.290 align:middle line:90%
that each is good at collecting.

00:39:24.290 --> 00:39:26.970 align:middle line:84%
But they didn't change the way
they're collecting the data.

00:39:26.970 --> 00:39:29.960 align:middle line:84%
So there's an errors
and omission line

00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:34.850 align:middle line:84%
that shows up in the accounts,
which is the way they reconcile

00:39:34.850 --> 00:39:36.770 align:middle line:90%
the two systems together.

00:39:36.770 --> 00:39:39.740 align:middle line:84%
And, again, that error
and omissions line

00:39:39.740 --> 00:39:42.020 align:middle line:90%
is sometimes quite substantial.

00:39:42.020 --> 00:39:46.070 align:middle line:84%
Here's a picture for these
integrated financial accounts,

00:39:46.070 --> 00:39:48.635 align:middle line:84%
which is really a review
of what you already know.

00:39:48.635 --> 00:39:50.690 align:middle line:90%
You start with production.

00:39:50.690 --> 00:39:55.070 align:middle line:84%
And then you have inputs,
outputs, profits, and so on,

00:39:55.070 --> 00:40:00.470 align:middle line:84%
producing income and savings,
if they didn't eat everything.

00:40:00.470 --> 00:40:02.810 align:middle line:84%
The savings has to
show up somewhere.

00:40:02.810 --> 00:40:07.070 align:middle line:84%
It's showing up in physical
fixed inputs, capital inputs,

00:40:07.070 --> 00:40:11.840 align:middle line:84%
or it's showing up in financial
inputs, net lending or asset

00:40:11.840 --> 00:40:16.410 align:middle line:84%
acquisition if positive,
or a decrease in borrowing,

00:40:16.410 --> 00:40:20.320 align:middle line:84%
assuming that profits
over here were positive.

00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:23.680 align:middle line:84%
Then you adjust for
capital gains and losses,

00:40:23.680 --> 00:40:26.740 align:middle line:90%
as I said, on the balance sheet.

00:40:26.740 --> 00:40:30.860 align:middle line:84%
And you end up with a net
balance sheet position.

00:40:30.860 --> 00:40:32.800 align:middle line:84%
So you see you're
going from flows

00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:36.730 align:middle line:84%
into changes in the stocks
into the new balance sheet.

00:40:36.730 --> 00:40:37.750 align:middle line:90%
You have assets.

00:40:37.750 --> 00:40:39.430 align:middle line:90%
You use assets in production.

00:40:39.430 --> 00:40:41.830 align:middle line:90%
You get the flow, et cetera.

00:40:41.830 --> 00:40:46.100 align:middle line:84%
Inventory-- that was asked about
earlier-- is an example, again,

00:40:46.100 --> 00:40:48.250 align:middle line:84%
of distinguishing
inputs in production

00:40:48.250 --> 00:40:50.300 align:middle line:90%
from ways of savings.

00:40:50.300 --> 00:40:53.770 align:middle line:84%
So this is the integrated
financial accounts.

00:40:53.770 --> 00:41:00.130 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, it is,
again, not available--

00:41:00.130 --> 00:41:03.070 align:middle line:84%
it has errors and
omissions, and it's not

00:41:03.070 --> 00:41:06.840 align:middle line:84%
available at the
state or local level.

00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:11.780 align:middle line:84%
So now I want to take you
through a series of examples

00:41:11.780 --> 00:41:15.980 align:middle line:84%
of other things that
are always in the news,

00:41:15.980 --> 00:41:17.780 align:middle line:90%
that you've heard about.

00:41:17.780 --> 00:41:23.330 align:middle line:84%
And I'll present those facts
to you and then explain how

00:41:23.330 --> 00:41:25.520 align:middle line:84%
the measurement
underlying those, quote,

00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:28.620 align:middle line:84%
"well-known facts"
is problematic.

00:41:28.620 --> 00:41:33.920 align:middle line:84%
So one, inequality-- and here
I'm drawing on this paper--

00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:36.080 align:middle line:90%
Piketty, Saez, and Zucman--

00:41:36.080 --> 00:41:38.190 align:middle line:84%
and they're obviously
not the only ones.

00:41:38.190 --> 00:41:42.770 align:middle line:84%
The story here is the
top 1% of the population

00:41:42.770 --> 00:41:46.200 align:middle line:90%
own 60% of the wealth.

00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:49.250 align:middle line:84%
You hear that over
and over again.

00:41:49.250 --> 00:41:52.380 align:middle line:84%
So where are these
numbers coming from?

00:41:52.380 --> 00:41:55.070 align:middle line:84%
Well, what we have
is quite limited.

00:41:55.070 --> 00:42:01.860 align:middle line:84%
These guys start with GDP as
measured by the BEA and so on.

00:42:01.860 --> 00:42:07.460 align:middle line:84%
And then they're saying, well,
who actually has part of it?

00:42:07.460 --> 00:42:09.410 align:middle line:90%
Who has the shares?

00:42:09.410 --> 00:42:12.330 align:middle line:90%
How big are the shares of GDP?

00:42:12.330 --> 00:42:14.960 align:middle line:84%
So they want to
create something new,

00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:18.530 align:middle line:84%
arguably, called
distributional accounts, which

00:42:18.530 --> 00:42:23.090 align:middle line:84%
is the way GDP is distributed
in the population,

00:42:23.090 --> 00:42:27.180 align:middle line:84%
saying GDP is fine for
totals, for growth, and so on.

00:42:27.180 --> 00:42:30.260 align:middle line:84%
But for inequality,
the aggregates

00:42:30.260 --> 00:42:33.900 align:middle line:84%
don't tell us the
degree of inequality.

00:42:33.900 --> 00:42:39.110 align:middle line:84%
So people have used different
surveys to measure inequality,

00:42:39.110 --> 00:42:41.640 align:middle line:90%
and there's a discrepancy.

00:42:41.640 --> 00:42:43.850 align:middle line:84%
So they're saying
that we really need

00:42:43.850 --> 00:42:46.370 align:middle line:90%
better distributional accounts.

00:42:46.370 --> 00:42:48.590 align:middle line:84%
What fraction of
economic growth accrues

00:42:48.590 --> 00:42:50.870 align:middle line:84%
to the bottom 50%
of the population

00:42:50.870 --> 00:42:53.750 align:middle line:84%
or the top 10% of
the population?

00:42:53.750 --> 00:42:57.170 align:middle line:84%
How much of the rise
in income inequality

00:42:57.170 --> 00:43:01.820 align:middle line:84%
is due to the change in labor
share of output versus capital

00:43:01.820 --> 00:43:03.080 align:middle line:90%
shares of output?

00:43:03.080 --> 00:43:06.230 align:middle line:84%
And even within labor,
what's the dispersion

00:43:06.230 --> 00:43:09.290 align:middle line:84%
in labor earnings across
different households

00:43:09.290 --> 00:43:10.770 align:middle line:90%
with respect to capital?

00:43:10.770 --> 00:43:12.860 align:middle line:84%
What's the rate of
return on capital?

00:43:12.860 --> 00:43:15.320 align:middle line:84%
They're complaining here
that we don't have answers

00:43:15.320 --> 00:43:16.640 align:middle line:90%
to these questions.

00:43:16.640 --> 00:43:18.680 align:middle line:84%
Actually, we don't
even have good answers

00:43:18.680 --> 00:43:22.070 align:middle line:84%
to the questions about how much
wealth is being redistributed

00:43:22.070 --> 00:43:24.420 align:middle line:90%
through taxes and transfers.

00:43:24.420 --> 00:43:26.150 align:middle line:90%
So what do they do?

00:43:26.150 --> 00:43:27.620 align:middle line:90%
They make an estimate.

00:43:27.620 --> 00:43:29.240 align:middle line:90%
And these guys--

00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:31.430 align:middle line:90%
Smith, Zidar, and Zwick--

00:43:31.430 --> 00:43:35.030 align:middle line:84%
complain about the estimate,
and they try to do better.

00:43:35.030 --> 00:43:37.790 align:middle line:84%
So why are the
estimates unreliable?

00:43:37.790 --> 00:43:40.850 align:middle line:84%
Because, as in the
theme of this lecture,

00:43:40.850 --> 00:43:44.600 align:middle line:84%
wealth and income are not
independently measured.

00:43:44.600 --> 00:43:46.250 align:middle line:84%
They're consistent
with one another

00:43:46.250 --> 00:43:48.860 align:middle line:90%
but only in a mechanical way.

00:43:48.860 --> 00:43:50.810 align:middle line:90%
How wealthy is a household?

00:43:50.810 --> 00:43:52.250 align:middle line:90%
We don't have the wealth.

00:43:52.250 --> 00:43:54.060 align:middle line:90%
Let's look at the flows.

00:43:54.060 --> 00:43:56.720 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at the income
flows over time the way

00:43:56.720 --> 00:44:02.180 align:middle line:84%
we did for that life cycle model
for Thailand, or, for example,

00:44:02.180 --> 00:44:04.610 align:middle line:84%
I showed you one
slide for the US.

00:44:04.610 --> 00:44:08.030 align:middle line:84%
If you had income
over time and say

00:44:08.030 --> 00:44:10.250 align:middle line:84%
they could put it in
the bank, then you

00:44:10.250 --> 00:44:12.320 align:middle line:84%
might want to
discount the income

00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:16.850 align:middle line:84%
and get the net present value
today of future labor earnings,

00:44:16.850 --> 00:44:21.780 align:middle line:84%
like human capital
or flows from assets.

00:44:21.780 --> 00:44:23.900 align:middle line:84%
The problem is, how
do you discount it?

00:44:23.900 --> 00:44:26.960 align:middle line:90%
What discount rate do you use?

00:44:26.960 --> 00:44:28.190 align:middle line:90%
Piketty et al.

00:44:28.190 --> 00:44:32.480 align:middle line:84%
are assuming a constant discount
rate across all the households,

00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:35.360 align:middle line:84%
despite the obvious
heterogeneity in households--

00:44:35.360 --> 00:44:39.620 align:middle line:84%
in particular, despite the fact
that some wealthier households

00:44:39.620 --> 00:44:45.110 align:middle line:84%
get income from business
and poorer households don't.

00:44:45.110 --> 00:44:48.320 align:middle line:84%
At best, they have
financial income.

00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:51.240 align:middle line:84%
But it's usually
wages and so on.

00:44:51.240 --> 00:44:56.120 align:middle line:84%
So Zwick basically
adjusts the discount rate.

00:44:56.120 --> 00:44:59.720 align:middle line:84%
And they start
changing the numbers.

00:44:59.720 --> 00:45:03.650 align:middle line:84%
Basically, the share
of wealth of the top 1%

00:45:03.650 --> 00:45:06.770 align:middle line:84%
is different from what
you commonly hear.

00:45:06.770 --> 00:45:10.250 align:middle line:84%
The share of wealth of the
top 10% of the population

00:45:10.250 --> 00:45:14.930 align:middle line:84%
is a bit different from
what you typically hear,

00:45:14.930 --> 00:45:18.200 align:middle line:84%
because they've allowed for
heterogeneity in this discount

00:45:18.200 --> 00:45:19.320 align:middle line:90%
rate.

00:45:19.320 --> 00:45:22.070 align:middle line:84%
So their estimates
of net worth are

00:45:22.070 --> 00:45:26.070 align:middle line:84%
different across these
different groups.

00:45:26.070 --> 00:45:30.710 align:middle line:84%
So that's one illustration
of the problems with very

00:45:30.710 --> 00:45:33.480 align:middle line:90%
important topical issues.

00:45:33.480 --> 00:45:36.980 align:middle line:84%
So much policy work
and politics is

00:45:36.980 --> 00:45:43.700 align:middle line:84%
based on perceived measures of
inequality that are actually

00:45:43.700 --> 00:45:46.490 align:middle line:90%
not terribly reliable.

00:45:46.490 --> 00:45:48.080 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying
people aren't poor,

00:45:48.080 --> 00:45:50.390 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not saying
there's no inequality.

00:45:50.390 --> 00:45:55.220 align:middle line:84%
I just wish we had better
quantitative measures of it.

00:45:55.220 --> 00:45:58.790 align:middle line:84%
Second application in
this terrible world

00:45:58.790 --> 00:46:00.230 align:middle line:90%
we're living in--

00:46:00.230 --> 00:46:02.070 align:middle line:90%
COVID-19.

00:46:02.070 --> 00:46:05.750 align:middle line:84%
So what is the
impact of COVID-19

00:46:05.750 --> 00:46:10.730 align:middle line:84%
on individuals, on groups,
on the entire economy?

00:46:10.730 --> 00:46:14.300 align:middle line:84%
Again, the problem
we face in the US--

00:46:14.300 --> 00:46:17.000 align:middle line:84%
the data are coming
from different sources.

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:18.810 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot of creativity.

00:46:18.810 --> 00:46:20.330 align:middle line:84%
I'll show you what
people have done.

00:46:20.330 --> 00:46:24.560 align:middle line:84%
But the bottom line is going
to be, again, the data are not

00:46:24.560 --> 00:46:28.820 align:middle line:84%
integrated in the sense
that the income flows are

00:46:28.820 --> 00:46:30.590 align:middle line:84%
measured but are not
measured in a way

00:46:30.590 --> 00:46:32.840 align:middle line:84%
that would be consistent
with a balance sheet.

00:46:32.840 --> 00:46:36.800 align:middle line:84%
In fact, typically, we do not
have both an income statement

00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:40.370 align:middle line:84%
and a balance sheet
for anybody in the US.

00:46:40.370 --> 00:46:42.230 align:middle line:90%
So here's a great paper--

00:46:42.230 --> 00:46:46.400 align:middle line:84%
Chetty and coauthors--
which is the starred paper

00:46:46.400 --> 00:46:47.780 align:middle line:90%
on the reading list.

00:46:47.780 --> 00:46:50.360 align:middle line:84%
"How Did COVID-19
and Stabilization

00:46:50.360 --> 00:46:52.800 align:middle line:84%
Policies Affect Spending
and Employment?"

00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:55.070 align:middle line:90%
And then subheader--

00:46:55.070 --> 00:46:58.610 align:middle line:84%
"A New Real-Time
Economic Data Tracker."

00:46:58.610 --> 00:47:01.220 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the paper,
you'll see the WWW dot.

00:47:01.220 --> 00:47:03.470 align:middle line:84%
You can click on
it, and you'll start

00:47:03.470 --> 00:47:05.880 align:middle line:90%
seeing a lot of geography.

00:47:05.880 --> 00:47:08.330 align:middle line:84%
So this is a summary of
what they're finding.

00:47:08.330 --> 00:47:11.270 align:middle line:84%
And I should tell you, this
and all the other slides

00:47:11.270 --> 00:47:15.590 align:middle line:84%
are based on what was going
on in the US post-March,

00:47:15.590 --> 00:47:19.160 align:middle line:84%
April, the first surge,
and not the surge that

00:47:19.160 --> 00:47:23.100 align:middle line:84%
took place early in the summer
and not the current mess.

00:47:23.100 --> 00:47:28.310 align:middle line:84%
So what they find is that
high-income individuals reduced

00:47:28.310 --> 00:47:31.880 align:middle line:84%
spending in mid-March,
particularly in areas

00:47:31.880 --> 00:47:34.580 align:middle line:84%
that had high COVID
infection rates,

00:47:34.580 --> 00:47:37.310 align:middle line:84%
and particularly in
sectors associated

00:47:37.310 --> 00:47:39.050 align:middle line:90%
with physical interaction.

00:47:39.050 --> 00:47:43.370 align:middle line:84%
So the reduction in
spending of the individuals

00:47:43.370 --> 00:47:47.690 align:middle line:84%
hurt businesses that catered
to high-income individuals,

00:47:47.690 --> 00:47:52.040 align:middle line:84%
namely, small businesses
in affluent zip codes,

00:47:52.040 --> 00:47:53.720 align:middle line:90%
like restaurants and so on.

00:47:53.720 --> 00:47:56.300 align:middle line:84%
They laid off their
employees, who

00:47:56.300 --> 00:47:58.820 align:middle line:84%
tend to be low-income
individuals, which

00:47:58.820 --> 00:48:02.180 align:middle line:84%
is where we got the surge
in unemployment, initially

00:48:02.180 --> 00:48:04.250 align:middle line:90%
in affluent areas.

00:48:04.250 --> 00:48:06.620 align:middle line:84%
You can see the
local diversity here.

00:48:06.620 --> 00:48:10.580 align:middle line:84%
So they go on to use an
event study to then estimate

00:48:10.580 --> 00:48:12.980 align:middle line:84%
the impact of policies
that were supposed

00:48:12.980 --> 00:48:15.710 align:middle line:90%
to mitigate the adverse impact.

00:48:15.710 --> 00:48:18.890 align:middle line:84%
States varied in
reopening, as you know.

00:48:18.890 --> 00:48:21.890 align:middle line:84%
And, nevertheless, it
didn't have a lot of impact

00:48:21.890 --> 00:48:23.180 align:middle line:90%
on local employment.

00:48:23.180 --> 00:48:26.930 align:middle line:84%
Stimulus payments to
households were made.

00:48:26.930 --> 00:48:29.340 align:middle line:84%
That did increase
consumer spending,

00:48:29.340 --> 00:48:33.380 align:middle line:84%
but again, had very little
impact on employment

00:48:33.380 --> 00:48:35.960 align:middle line:84%
because, obviously, you
don't take the check

00:48:35.960 --> 00:48:41.570 align:middle line:84%
and go buy something at risk
in a shop that may be closed.

00:48:41.570 --> 00:48:43.340 align:middle line:84%
At best, you're going
to spend it on--

00:48:43.340 --> 00:48:46.970 align:middle line:84%
I'll get to the spending
and saving momentarily.

00:48:46.970 --> 00:48:49.400 align:middle line:84%
In particular, this
Paycheck Protection Program,

00:48:49.400 --> 00:48:53.300 align:middle line:84%
which is in the news again
today because the BEA is under--

00:48:53.300 --> 00:48:57.560 align:middle line:84%
SBA is under scrutiny--
those loans had

00:48:57.560 --> 00:49:01.380 align:middle line:84%
little impact on employment
in small businesses.

00:49:01.380 --> 00:49:02.300 align:middle line:90%
So I don't know.

00:49:02.300 --> 00:49:04.940 align:middle line:84%
If you're macro-oriented,
you might think,

00:49:04.940 --> 00:49:06.710 align:middle line:90%
that's an increase in spending.

00:49:06.710 --> 00:49:08.480 align:middle line:84%
It should affect
aggregate demand.

00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:11.060 align:middle line:84%
It should have shown up
as increased employment.

00:49:11.060 --> 00:49:11.960 align:middle line:90%
But it didn't.

00:49:11.960 --> 00:49:14.330 align:middle line:84%
This is a study from
the Philadelphia Fed.

00:49:14.330 --> 00:49:17.750 align:middle line:84%
And they used payments
transection data,

00:49:17.750 --> 00:49:19.250 align:middle line:90%
called Fiserv.

00:49:19.250 --> 00:49:22.400 align:middle line:84%
So this is related to
credit/debit card transactions,

00:49:22.400 --> 00:49:24.470 align:middle line:90%
but it's not Visa data.

00:49:24.470 --> 00:49:27.170 align:middle line:84%
It's actually the
processing company

00:49:27.170 --> 00:49:31.070 align:middle line:84%
that puts devices out there so
you can swipe your credit card

00:49:31.070 --> 00:49:34.130 align:middle line:84%
and send a communication
from the store to the bank.

00:49:34.130 --> 00:49:39.050 align:middle line:84%
Those transactions data are
available on Fiserv in the US.

00:49:39.050 --> 00:49:43.130 align:middle line:84%
And the Philadelphia Fed study
is consistent with Chetty

00:49:43.130 --> 00:49:45.710 align:middle line:84%
and so on in the sense that
spending on restaurants

00:49:45.710 --> 00:49:48.050 align:middle line:90%
and lodgings went down.

00:49:48.050 --> 00:49:51.020 align:middle line:84%
And instead, people started
spending money at home

00:49:51.020 --> 00:49:53.270 align:middle line:84%
on home improvement,
some people.

00:49:53.270 --> 00:49:56.420 align:middle line:84%
So this is, again, the
story of heterogeneity.

00:49:56.420 --> 00:49:59.360 align:middle line:84%
Some people were able,
as essential workers,

00:49:59.360 --> 00:50:00.890 align:middle line:90%
to keep working on site.

00:50:00.890 --> 00:50:04.070 align:middle line:84%
Not much shows up for
their spending differences.

00:50:04.070 --> 00:50:07.730 align:middle line:84%
Some start working remotely,
but they're still working.

00:50:07.730 --> 00:50:09.500 align:middle line:84%
Their expenditures
are pretty much

00:50:09.500 --> 00:50:13.400 align:middle line:84%
proportional to their income,
not terribly surprisingly.

00:50:13.400 --> 00:50:16.430 align:middle line:84%
You have people who were
laid off and furloughed.

00:50:16.430 --> 00:50:18.800 align:middle line:84%
They're not getting
income anymore.

00:50:18.800 --> 00:50:24.230 align:middle line:84%
And the expenditures
drop more for the people

00:50:24.230 --> 00:50:27.720 align:middle line:84%
who had been earning
the least income.

00:50:27.720 --> 00:50:29.930 align:middle line:84%
So there's a big
drop in expenditures

00:50:29.930 --> 00:50:33.320 align:middle line:84%
to vulnerable people,
people who had low income

00:50:33.320 --> 00:50:36.600 align:middle line:84%
to begin with-- more on the
balance sheet momentarily.

00:50:36.600 --> 00:50:39.650 align:middle line:84%
Now, one potential
limitation of these data

00:50:39.650 --> 00:50:43.490 align:middle line:84%
is they're electronic
transactions, obviously.

00:50:43.490 --> 00:50:45.260 align:middle line:90%
Well, what about currency?

00:50:45.260 --> 00:50:47.300 align:middle line:84%
Well, you might
think, oh, come on.

00:50:47.300 --> 00:50:48.380 align:middle line:90%
That's not a big deal.

00:50:48.380 --> 00:50:49.880 align:middle line:90%
It is a big deal.

00:50:49.880 --> 00:50:53.690 align:middle line:84%
In the US, roughly
25% of transactions

00:50:53.690 --> 00:50:57.260 align:middle line:84%
are still accounted
for by paper currency.

00:50:57.260 --> 00:50:59.600 align:middle line:84%
And then, mystery
of all mysteries, it

00:50:59.600 --> 00:51:01.400 align:middle line:90%
skyrocketed upwards.

00:51:01.400 --> 00:51:04.500 align:middle line:84%
And that's not just
a US phenomenon.

00:51:04.500 --> 00:51:06.320 align:middle line:90%
So it's kind of perplexing.

00:51:06.320 --> 00:51:09.290 align:middle line:84%
You would think paper currency
is pretty dirty stuff.

00:51:09.290 --> 00:51:12.530 align:middle line:84%
You're exposed to the virus,
handling other people's-- you

00:51:12.530 --> 00:51:15.120 align:middle line:84%
eventually get their
money and so on.

00:51:15.120 --> 00:51:16.550 align:middle line:84%
Some people take
it home at night

00:51:16.550 --> 00:51:19.640 align:middle line:84%
and wash it because they don't
want to be infected by it.

00:51:19.640 --> 00:51:23.630 align:middle line:84%
But they seem to be doing stuff
that's requiring more of it

00:51:23.630 --> 00:51:26.480 align:middle line:84%
because currency outstanding,
as measured by the Federal

00:51:26.480 --> 00:51:28.280 align:middle line:90%
Reserve, has gone way up.

00:51:28.280 --> 00:51:31.010 align:middle line:84%
And there's a shortage of
coins in the US right now.

00:51:31.010 --> 00:51:32.780 align:middle line:90%
So we don't know why.

00:51:32.780 --> 00:51:35.150 align:middle line:84%
And it also makes
the measurement

00:51:35.150 --> 00:51:37.370 align:middle line:90%
under Fiserv a little trickier.

00:51:37.370 --> 00:51:40.160 align:middle line:84%
This would not be
true with Alipay

00:51:40.160 --> 00:51:44.390 align:middle line:84%
in China because they got
all the transactions data--

00:51:44.390 --> 00:51:46.460 align:middle line:84%
maybe we'll get
back to that later.

00:51:46.460 --> 00:51:48.750 align:middle line:84%
What about lower-income
households?

00:51:48.750 --> 00:51:52.430 align:middle line:84%
So here's another study
by Baker and co-authors

00:51:52.430 --> 00:51:53.890 align:middle line:90%
on income and liquidity.

00:51:53.890 --> 00:51:56.190 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is kind
of interesting.

00:51:56.190 --> 00:51:59.330 align:middle line:84%
They're looking at the
marginal propensity

00:51:59.330 --> 00:52:03.380 align:middle line:84%
to consume out of the
stimulus payments.

00:52:03.380 --> 00:52:07.490 align:middle line:84%
They made friends with
a not-for-profit company

00:52:07.490 --> 00:52:12.440 align:middle line:84%
called SaverLife, helping
working families previously

00:52:12.440 --> 00:52:14.780 align:middle line:84%
for the virus,
helping those families

00:52:14.780 --> 00:52:19.560 align:middle line:84%
to develop better savings habits
and to meet financial goals.

00:52:19.560 --> 00:52:22.760 align:middle line:84%
This reminds me a lot of what
we were doing in Thailand.

00:52:22.760 --> 00:52:25.430 align:middle line:84%
In particular, they had
individuals link there

00:52:25.430 --> 00:52:26.790 align:middle line:90%
voluntarily--

00:52:26.790 --> 00:52:30.800 align:middle line:84%
if they chose to do it, link
their accounts to SaverLife.

00:52:30.800 --> 00:52:34.940 align:middle line:84%
So now SaverLife has access to
their bank account information

00:52:34.940 --> 00:52:38.060 align:middle line:84%
to see the transactions
and the balance sheets.

00:52:38.060 --> 00:52:40.140 align:middle line:84%
You see where I'm
going with this.

00:52:40.140 --> 00:52:44.300 align:middle line:84%
So now you can finally, for this
special subset of households,

00:52:44.300 --> 00:52:46.040 align:middle line:90%
see inflows and outflows.

00:52:46.040 --> 00:52:49.710 align:middle line:84%
I guess I misspoke a minute ago
when I said it's never done.

00:52:49.710 --> 00:52:53.450 align:middle line:84%
This is an instance where we
have a version of the income

00:52:53.450 --> 00:52:56.210 align:middle line:84%
statement and a version
of the balance sheet,

00:52:56.210 --> 00:52:58.580 align:middle line:84%
at least for some
of the line items.

00:52:58.580 --> 00:53:01.100 align:middle line:84%
What happened with
the stimulus payments?

00:53:01.100 --> 00:53:05.480 align:middle line:84%
As soon as they get the money,
they spend it within 10 days.

00:53:05.480 --> 00:53:09.620 align:middle line:84%
And they spend it on food and
nondurables, pay the rent--

00:53:09.620 --> 00:53:12.110 align:middle line:90%
that's in the news again lately.

00:53:12.110 --> 00:53:15.740 align:middle line:84%
So you get a picture of
relatively poor households.

00:53:15.740 --> 00:53:19.550 align:middle line:84%
Not only that, they looked
at the balance sheet

00:53:19.550 --> 00:53:23.000 align:middle line:84%
to see how much, quote,
"liquidity" households had.

00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:27.050 align:middle line:84%
And the lower the liquid
stuff in the balance sheet,

00:53:27.050 --> 00:53:30.170 align:middle line:84%
the larger their marginal
propensity to consume out

00:53:30.170 --> 00:53:32.360 align:middle line:90%
of the stimulus payment.

00:53:32.360 --> 00:53:35.640 align:middle line:84%
So this looks like households
that have a pretty lean balance

00:53:35.640 --> 00:53:36.140 align:middle line:90%
sheet.

00:53:36.140 --> 00:53:38.120 align:middle line:84%
They do not have
a lot of assets.

00:53:38.120 --> 00:53:40.380 align:middle line:84%
They certainly don't
have liquid assets.

00:53:40.380 --> 00:53:42.840 align:middle line:84%
So then they have
been saving very much.

00:53:42.840 --> 00:53:45.870 align:middle line:84%
And when they get that stimulus
payment, they spend it.

00:53:45.870 --> 00:53:48.770 align:middle line:84%
So they must have been
cutting back on expenditures,

00:53:48.770 --> 00:53:51.140 align:middle line:84%
at least before they got
the stimulus payment.

00:53:51.140 --> 00:53:54.110 align:middle line:84%
And, likewise, they
didn't seem to save it.

00:53:54.110 --> 00:53:56.900 align:middle line:84%
They could have taken the
income transfer and put it

00:53:56.900 --> 00:53:58.190 align:middle line:90%
into their savings account.

00:53:58.190 --> 00:53:59.000 align:middle line:90%
But they didn't.

00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:00.800 align:middle line:90%
By and large, they spent it.

00:54:00.800 --> 00:54:03.985 align:middle line:84%
Well, it makes sense
if you're poor,

00:54:03.985 --> 00:54:05.360 align:middle line:84%
and you don't have
liquid assets,

00:54:05.360 --> 00:54:07.220 align:middle line:90%
and you've lost your income.

00:54:07.220 --> 00:54:09.290 align:middle line:84%
But then you come
to this other study.

00:54:09.290 --> 00:54:13.850 align:middle line:84%
This is JPMorgan, the bank,
using their own internal data

00:54:13.850 --> 00:54:17.300 align:middle line:84%
on household accounts
held by JPMorgan.

00:54:17.300 --> 00:54:20.570 align:middle line:84%
And they have an institute
that does research.

00:54:20.570 --> 00:54:27.410 align:middle line:84%
So they're reporting here on the
spending of various households,

00:54:27.410 --> 00:54:29.930 align:middle line:90%
including low-income households.

00:54:29.930 --> 00:54:34.160 align:middle line:84%
And they find large
increases in liquid assets

00:54:34.160 --> 00:54:36.830 align:middle line:84%
for almost all
households, including

00:54:36.830 --> 00:54:38.690 align:middle line:90%
these low-income households.

00:54:38.690 --> 00:54:41.660 align:middle line:84%
That's exactly the opposite
of what Baker found.

00:54:41.660 --> 00:54:43.770 align:middle line:90%
So it's a bit of a puzzle.

00:54:43.770 --> 00:54:45.620 align:middle line:84%
Now, granted, it's
a different sample.

00:54:45.620 --> 00:54:48.050 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean that one is
wrong and the other is right.

00:54:48.050 --> 00:54:50.390 align:middle line:84%
But it certainly
shows you that we're

00:54:50.390 --> 00:54:52.310 align:middle line:84%
getting very mixed
pictures here,

00:54:52.310 --> 00:54:54.800 align:middle line:84%
because these are
among the very few ways

00:54:54.800 --> 00:54:57.530 align:middle line:84%
that you can join
the stocks and flows.

00:54:57.530 --> 00:54:59.450 align:middle line:84%
You can get the
income and balance

00:54:59.450 --> 00:55:03.530 align:middle line:84%
sheet for customers of
JPMorgan if you construct it,

00:55:03.530 --> 00:55:04.490 align:middle line:90%
as these guys did.

00:55:04.490 --> 00:55:06.560 align:middle line:84%
And you can get
it for SaverLife,

00:55:06.560 --> 00:55:10.610 align:middle line:84%
which is the data that Baker
and company were using.

00:55:10.610 --> 00:55:12.800 align:middle line:84%
They also looked at
small businesses.

00:55:12.800 --> 00:55:17.000 align:middle line:84%
And they find cash balances
in JPMorgan accounts

00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:21.950 align:middle line:84%
of small businesses
decreased when COVID arrived

00:55:21.950 --> 00:55:25.550 align:middle line:84%
and decreased more in
some cities than others

00:55:25.550 --> 00:55:28.820 align:middle line:84%
and decreased more
for certain sectors

00:55:28.820 --> 00:55:31.230 align:middle line:90%
and for certain ethnicities.

00:55:31.230 --> 00:55:33.680 align:middle line:84%
So, again,
restaurants hit hard--

00:55:33.680 --> 00:55:37.250 align:middle line:84%
Asian-owned firms actually
hugely hit, even more

00:55:37.250 --> 00:55:39.890 align:middle line:84%
than Black firms, which,
in turn, were hit harder

00:55:39.890 --> 00:55:42.530 align:middle line:90%
than white-operated businesses.

00:55:42.530 --> 00:55:44.300 align:middle line:90%
So businesses are hurting.

00:55:44.300 --> 00:55:46.430 align:middle line:84%
Some people think
small businesses--

00:55:46.430 --> 00:55:49.010 align:middle line:84%
small and medium
enterprises are the backbone

00:55:49.010 --> 00:55:51.180 align:middle line:90%
of the US and many economies.

00:55:51.180 --> 00:55:55.730 align:middle line:84%
And so the adverse impact of
COVID hits hard on the economy

00:55:55.730 --> 00:55:57.440 align:middle line:90%
when it hits these businesses.

00:55:57.440 --> 00:56:00.170 align:middle line:84%
So then you would hope
this Paycheck Protection

00:56:00.170 --> 00:56:02.450 align:middle line:90%
Program would have helped.

00:56:02.450 --> 00:56:06.260 align:middle line:84%
So the Paycheck PPP
Program passed by Congress

00:56:06.260 --> 00:56:09.530 align:middle line:84%
allowed the Treasury
to fund loans

00:56:09.530 --> 00:56:12.020 align:middle line:84%
through the Small
Business Administration.

00:56:12.020 --> 00:56:15.530 align:middle line:84%
SBA loans in the US are
for small businesses.

00:56:15.530 --> 00:56:17.840 align:middle line:90%
They're 85% guaranteed loans.

00:56:17.840 --> 00:56:21.600 align:middle line:84%
But they're initiated
by commercial banks.

00:56:21.600 --> 00:56:24.800 align:middle line:84%
So in order to
get access to PPP,

00:56:24.800 --> 00:56:26.960 align:middle line:84%
you essentially
already had to have

00:56:26.960 --> 00:56:28.910 align:middle line:90%
some relationship with a bank.

00:56:28.910 --> 00:56:31.640 align:middle line:84%
So, in the end,
who got the money?

00:56:31.640 --> 00:56:36.110 align:middle line:84%
People that had bank accounts
in relationship banking.

00:56:36.110 --> 00:56:38.180 align:middle line:84%
This picture struck
me this morning

00:56:38.180 --> 00:56:40.880 align:middle line:84%
when I was reviewing
before class

00:56:40.880 --> 00:56:45.710 align:middle line:84%
because these red areas
in March and April

00:56:45.710 --> 00:56:49.010 align:middle line:84%
were pretty much
low-virus areas.

00:56:49.010 --> 00:56:52.700 align:middle line:84%
Of course, nowadays, today,
everything is reversed.

00:56:52.700 --> 00:56:56.300 align:middle line:84%
And this is where
the current surge is.

00:56:56.300 --> 00:56:58.760 align:middle line:84%
But it was not
like this in March.

00:56:58.760 --> 00:57:01.460 align:middle line:84%
Instead, it was
New York, remember?

00:57:01.460 --> 00:57:04.820 align:middle line:84%
Well, New York didn't get
very many of these PPP loans.

00:57:04.820 --> 00:57:06.530 align:middle line:90%
So the loans went--

00:57:06.530 --> 00:57:09.800 align:middle line:90%
so it's a complaint, yes.

00:57:09.800 --> 00:57:14.060 align:middle line:84%
It's also a comment on the
physical infrastructure.

00:57:14.060 --> 00:57:15.880 align:middle line:84%
Because we don't have
good measurement,

00:57:15.880 --> 00:57:19.460 align:middle line:84%
we also didn't have a good way
of getting purchasing power

00:57:19.460 --> 00:57:22.100 align:middle line:84%
into the hands of those
small businesses that

00:57:22.100 --> 00:57:23.940 align:middle line:90%
really needed the liquidity.

00:57:23.940 --> 00:57:26.780 align:middle line:84%
So, to bring all
these pieces together,

00:57:26.780 --> 00:57:29.270 align:middle line:90%
we need better data in the US.

00:57:29.270 --> 00:57:31.880 align:middle line:84%
The US doesn't have
surveys like what

00:57:31.880 --> 00:57:33.950 align:middle line:90%
I had shown you for Thailand.

00:57:33.950 --> 00:57:36.980 align:middle line:84%
And, likewise, there
is payments data--

00:57:36.980 --> 00:57:38.060 align:middle line:90%
I was alluding to it--

00:57:38.060 --> 00:57:40.910 align:middle line:84%
Scott Schuh was
at the Boston Fed,

00:57:40.910 --> 00:57:43.010 align:middle line:84%
and they were
collecting surveys.

00:57:43.010 --> 00:57:46.790 align:middle line:84%
That's how we know how many
people use currency in the US.

00:57:46.790 --> 00:57:49.040 align:middle line:90%
So I've teamed up with Scott.

00:57:49.040 --> 00:57:52.820 align:middle line:84%
And we're making plans
to basically collect data

00:57:52.820 --> 00:57:54.770 align:middle line:90%
like we collected in Thailand.

00:57:54.770 --> 00:57:58.010 align:middle line:84%
Scott moved from Boston
to West Virginia.

00:57:58.010 --> 00:58:00.140 align:middle line:84%
He's at the University
of West Virginia.

00:58:00.140 --> 00:58:03.140 align:middle line:84%
That's a deliberate
choice because that's

00:58:03.140 --> 00:58:04.490 align:middle line:90%
an obvious area--

00:58:04.490 --> 00:58:07.190 align:middle line:84%
West Virginia being a
relatively poor state

00:58:07.190 --> 00:58:08.180 align:middle line:90%
in the United States.

00:58:08.180 --> 00:58:11.990 align:middle line:84%
And that's basically
what we hope

00:58:11.990 --> 00:58:13.980 align:middle line:90%
will be the starting point.

00:58:13.980 --> 00:58:18.110 align:middle line:84%
So we have in mind here an
ambitious multiyear research

00:58:18.110 --> 00:58:21.290 align:middle line:84%
program, where we're going
to be collecting data

00:58:21.290 --> 00:58:23.300 align:middle line:90%
according to best practices.

00:58:23.300 --> 00:58:28.160 align:middle line:84%
Part of it is going to combine
the Boston Fed payment surveys

00:58:28.160 --> 00:58:30.920 align:middle line:90%
with my surveys from Thailand.

00:58:30.920 --> 00:58:33.320 align:middle line:84%
But part of it is we're
not going to collect it

00:58:33.320 --> 00:58:35.480 align:middle line:90%
all with physical surveys.

00:58:35.480 --> 00:58:38.850 align:middle line:84%
We want to get the
electronic data.

00:58:38.850 --> 00:58:41.690 align:middle line:84%
So we will go to the
households and so on

00:58:41.690 --> 00:58:43.280 align:middle line:84%
and try to get
permission the way

00:58:43.280 --> 00:58:47.630 align:middle line:84%
Baker et al. did to access
the electronic data for bank

00:58:47.630 --> 00:58:50.660 align:middle line:84%
account and payroll
information, assuming

00:58:50.660 --> 00:58:52.580 align:middle line:90%
that's the way they get paid.

00:58:52.580 --> 00:58:55.040 align:middle line:84%
So we'll run a survey to
see whether households

00:58:55.040 --> 00:58:58.220 align:middle line:84%
are willing to share
this data with us or not

00:58:58.220 --> 00:59:03.380 align:middle line:84%
and figure out the best
method, and then collect it,

00:59:03.380 --> 00:59:06.030 align:middle line:84%
very mindful of the
financial accounts.

00:59:06.030 --> 00:59:08.660 align:middle line:84%
So we'll be using the
framework of integrated

00:59:08.660 --> 00:59:11.900 align:middle line:84%
financial accounts, linking
the balance sheet to the income

00:59:11.900 --> 00:59:15.830 align:middle line:84%
statement and running
checks all the while

00:59:15.830 --> 00:59:19.550 align:middle line:84%
so that we have as good of a
survey with as few errors as

00:59:19.550 --> 00:59:20.660 align:middle line:90%
possible.

00:59:20.660 --> 00:59:22.970 align:middle line:84%
I wish we were a little bit
further along with this.

00:59:22.970 --> 00:59:26.190 align:middle line:84%
But I'll just say that if
any of you are interested,

00:59:26.190 --> 00:59:30.620 align:middle line:84%
let me know, because there
is a lot of work to do.

00:59:30.620 --> 00:59:33.620 align:middle line:84%
But, actually,
nowadays, traveling

00:59:33.620 --> 00:59:35.060 align:middle line:90%
isn't very easy either.

00:59:35.060 --> 00:59:38.510 align:middle line:84%
But my heart is in
this enterprise.

00:59:38.510 --> 00:59:41.340 align:middle line:90%
So that's all for today.

00:59:41.340 --> 00:59:44.570 align:middle line:84%
This is kind of the
state of data in the US.

00:59:44.570 --> 00:59:49.560 align:middle line:84%
And I've chosen to do this
by looking at 3 topics--

00:59:49.560 --> 00:59:54.680 align:middle line:84%
one, what we did in Thailand,
which is local economies--

00:59:54.680 --> 00:59:56.450 align:middle line:90%
in this case, states in the US--

00:59:56.450 --> 00:59:59.480 align:middle line:84%
looking at it through the lens
of balance sheets and income

00:59:59.480 --> 01:00:01.730 align:middle line:84%
statements if possible,
although struggling

01:00:01.730 --> 01:00:04.250 align:middle line:84%
because we don't have the
data collected that way,

01:00:04.250 --> 01:00:06.980 align:middle line:84%
and then looking at the
impact of trade shocks

01:00:06.980 --> 01:00:09.300 align:middle line:84%
and state-level
balance of payments.

01:00:09.300 --> 01:00:12.500 align:middle line:84%
The second was
measures of inequality

01:00:12.500 --> 01:00:15.360 align:middle line:84%
and how we wish
they were better.

01:00:15.360 --> 01:00:19.220 align:middle line:84%
And the third-- the impact
of the virus, which, again,

01:00:19.220 --> 01:00:22.830 align:middle line:90%
runs into the same limitations.

01:00:22.830 --> 01:00:25.570 align:middle line:90%
Questions?

01:00:25.570 --> 01:00:26.070 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:00:26.070 --> 01:00:31.320 align:middle line:84%
So that completes the second of
the two applications of trade

01:00:31.320 --> 01:00:36.540 align:middle line:84%
for Thailand in the US, back
to the two-by-two-by-two.

01:00:36.540 --> 01:00:41.370 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll gear up for
a review of the material

01:00:41.370 --> 01:00:43.260 align:middle line:84%
that we've covered
since the last midterm.

01:00:43.260 --> 01:00:44.610 align:middle line:90%
We'll do that next Tuesday.

01:00:44.610 --> 01:00:47.850 align:middle line:84%
And you can start on
Friday with Michael.

01:00:47.850 --> 01:00:50.140 align:middle line:90%
So that's all for today.

01:00:50.140 --> 01:00:52.160 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

01:00:52.160 --> 01:01:07.360 align:middle line:90%

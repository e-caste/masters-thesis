00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:05.940
PROFESSOR: So we're slightly
into chapter seven, which is

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.029
the algebra chapter.

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:12.600
We're talking about a number of
algebraic objects, starting

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.070
with integers and groups
and fields.

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.970
Polynomials.

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.700
Our objective in this chapter
is simply to get to finite

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:27.370
fields so that you have some
sense what they are, how they

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:30.780
can be constructed, what their
parameters are, how you can

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:34.470
operate with them by addition,
multiplication, so forth, as

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:36.630
you would expect in a field.

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.440
Subtraction, division.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.380
And that's really all
we're aiming to do.

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:46.750
I'm trying to give you a short
course in algebra, really, in

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:49.200
two lectures or fewer.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.100
And clearly I'm going to
miss a lot of things.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.155
In particular, I'm not going
to cover even everything

00:00:55.155 --> 00:00:58.830
that's in chapter seven, which
itself is a highly compressed

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:01.950
introduction to finite fields.

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:05.660
I'm trying to do this while
remaining faithful to the

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:09.020
philosophy of this course and
other courses at MIT, which is

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.880
that you should really prove
everything and show why things

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.810
are true, and not simply
make assertions.

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.970
So it's a little tough and it
forces me to go a little fast,

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.820
but I hope that you can keep
up, and especially with the

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.680
assistance of the notes or the
many possible other things you

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.680
could read on this subject,
which are listed in the notes,

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.390
you'll be able to keep up.

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.960
And some of you, of course, have
seen this in other places

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.490
in more extended form.

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.340
Now, this will get us in a
position to start to talk

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.150
about Reed-Solomon codes, which
are the single major

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:50.250
accomplishment of the field of
algebraic coding theory.

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.920
Certainly for getting to
capacity on the additive white

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.835
Gaussian noise channel and for
lots of other things, they're

00:01:58.835 --> 00:02:04.340
an extremely useful and widely
implemented class of codes.

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.790
And we'll be able to maybe just
get to the beginning of

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:08.910
that by Wednesday.

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.610
And then I won't be here again
next week, but fortunately we

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:17.760
have an expert on campus who is
far more expert than I in

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.180
Reed-Solomon codes, their
decoding algorithms, who has

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.360
agreed to talk for two lectures,
maybe one more

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.570
focused on Reed-Solomon codes
and one, I hope, on his whole

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:31.040
philosophy of life.

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.580
Perhaps.

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.830
I don't know how it's going to
come out, but I'll see it on

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.710
TV when I get back.

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:40.740
Anyway, Ralf Koetter will be
lecturer for Monday and

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.900
Wednesday next week.

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.880
I think you'll enjoy
the change of pace.

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:47.360
OK.

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.780
So where are we in
chapter seven?

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:50.800
We're not very far.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.250
We're talking about these
various algebraic objects.

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:59.030
We've started with integers
just to get you

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.860
into the feel of it.

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.260
We mainly talked about integer
factorization, the Euclidean

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.860
division algorithm, things that
you've known for a very

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.640
long time, basically here
because A, we're going to be

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.100
using integers as we go along,
and their factorization

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:18.360
properties, B, it's a model for
polynomials, which behave

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:22.080
very much the same way as
integers because they're both

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.390
principal ideal domains.

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:28.380
In particular, we looked at the
integers mod n with the

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:34.900
rules of mod n arithmetic, which
we're going to call Zn.

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.800
This is simply 0 through n
minus 1 with the mod n

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.440
arithmetic rules.

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.920
And then we went on to groups.

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:49.140
We first gave the standard
axioms for groups, and then I

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.000
gave you an alternative set of
axioms which focused on this

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.370
permutation property.

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:59.590
If you add, I'm calling the
group operation addition,

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:03.450
because essentially all the
groups we talk about are going

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.240
to be abelian --

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:08.950
if we add a group element
to the group,

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:10.530
what do we get back?

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:12.800
We get the whole group again.

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:15.040
It's permuted, it's the
entire group, it's

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.589
in a different order.

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:18.050
All right?

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:21.610
And with this and the identity,
this plus the

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:26.770
identity and the associativity
axiom are also a sufficient

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:28.960
set of axioms for the group.

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.010
And I think this is really the
most useful thing to think

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:33.540
about with a group.

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:35.460
We've also called it the
group property when we

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:36.845
talked about codes.

00:04:36.845 --> 00:04:40.000
You know, if you add the code
word to all the elements in

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.440
the code, you get
the code back.

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:47.090
And you saw how useful that
was for seeing certain

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:51.110
symmetry properties of minor
linear block codes.

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:54.150
So we even talked about cyclic
groups, specifically finite

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:55.570
cyclic groups.

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:59.340
And we showed that all
them basically are

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.600
isomorphic to z mod n.

00:05:04.305 --> 00:05:06.800
A cyclic group is defined
by a single generator.

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:10.830
If we identify that generator
with one, G plus G is

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:14.070
identified with 2, and so forth,
then we get an addition

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:16.840
table which is exactly the same
addition table as Zn.

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.770
And that's what we mean when
we say two groups are

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:20.480
isomorphic.

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:23.680
So all finite cyclic groups
look like Zn.

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:26.900
You can think of them as
being images of Zn.

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:28.400
All right?

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.930
It's the only one you
need to know about.

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:31.500
OK.

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:37.950
So that's where we are any
questions on this material?

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:41.110
Pretty easy, I think.

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:43.310
Terribly easy if you've ever
seen any of this before.

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:48.080
Probably takes a little
absorbing if you haven't.

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:48.330
OK.

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:53.880
Now the next natural subject
to talk about is subgroups.

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:55.950
And what is a subgroup?

00:05:55.950 --> 00:06:00.640
A subgroup simply a subset of
elements in the group which,

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:04.680
together with the group
operation already specified in

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:10.345
G, which we're calling circle
plus, is itself a group.

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:13.810
What does that mean?

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:17.220
Well, associativity comes for
free, because we already have

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:21.840
that property for circle plus
in G. Obviously H has to

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:28.460
include the identity in order
to satisfy the group axioms.

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:31.290
And finally, the third group
axiom is this permutation or

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:34.770
group property that if we add
any element of the subgroup to

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:38.430
itself, we have to stay within
the subgroup and ultimately

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:40.270
generate the whole subgroup.

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:43.150
That means that subtraction,

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:46.990
cancellation hold in the subgroup.

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:48.310
All right?

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:51.390
So that's clear.

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:55.460
What's an example
of a subgroup?

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:57.180
If we have --

00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:01.180
we talked about Z10
as the group.

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:02.310
What would be a subgroup?

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:03.560
Anybody?

00:07:08.167 --> 00:07:10.120
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:12.220
PROFESSOR: 0 to 4.

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:12.750
OK.

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:18.970
So you're proposing that H is
the elements 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 out

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:22.730
of G. Does that work?

00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:25.670
This doesn't include 0.

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:27.110
But suppose I add 3 and 4?

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:34.950
AUDIENCE: I assume that you
have modules for a reason.

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:35.650
PROFESSOR: No.

00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:41.370
In this group, the group
operations modulo 10 addition.

00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:43.720
Subgroup has to have the
same operation as the

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:44.970
group it came from.

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:53.840
What you've got here is you've
already got, in essence, a

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:57.036
quotient group.

00:07:57.036 --> 00:07:58.630
Or at least that's where
you're headed.

00:07:58.630 --> 00:08:01.130
So this is not a subgroup.

00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:02.300
Thank you for the suggestion.

00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:03.310
Fails.

00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:03.970
Anyone else?

00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:04.300
What?

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:05.250
AUDIENCE: 0,1?

00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:07.020
PROFESSOR: 0,1.

00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:07.230
OK.

00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:10.610
Let's try that.

00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:13.990
And it contains the identity
0 plus 1 is

00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:14.700
certainly in the group.

00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:17.160
How about 1 plus 1?

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:20.810
It's not in the group.

00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:21.617
0 and 5?

00:08:21.617 --> 00:08:22.867
That sounds more promising.

00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:31.580
Now, 0 plus -- what's the
addition table of this?

00:08:34.419 --> 00:08:35.669
0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5.

00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:39.940
What's 5 plus 5?

00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:40.570
It's 10.

00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:43.360
But mod-10 , that's 0.

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:45.290
So it seems we do
have a group.

00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:51.750
And in fact, this is a finite
cyclic group generated by 5,

00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:57.500
and has two elements, so
it's isomorphic to Z2.

00:08:57.500 --> 00:08:59.740
In other words, the addition
table looks just like the

00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:01.600
addition table of Z2
with a relabeling.

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:06.860
OK.

00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:10.080
Any other subgroups of Z10?

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:11.280
The even integers.

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:11.680
There.

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:14.010
Now we're really smoking.

00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:18.890
H equals 0,2,4,6,8.

00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:20.580
Those are all the even
integers in Z10.

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:26.380
And again, evens plus
evens equal evens.

00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:31.880
So we get a group of five
elements, satisfies is the

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:39.320
group property, and it's
isomorphic to what?

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:39.845
Z5 --

00:09:39.845 --> 00:09:41.310
yeah.

00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:44.490
This is obviously the same group
is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, just

00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:45.740
doubling everything.

00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:49.720
Operates the same way.

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:50.970
So it's change of labels.

00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:53.460
OK.

00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:55.485
So there are some examples
of subgroups.

00:09:59.030 --> 00:10:03.700
Let's take another
good example.

00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:05.680
Let's just take the set
of all integers.

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:07.780
That's an infinite group.

00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:12.400
Mathematicians call it cyclic,
even though it doesn't cycle.

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:13.800
What's a subgroup of that?

00:10:23.530 --> 00:10:24.460
AUDIENCE: Even integers.

00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:25.450
PROFESSOR: All even integers!

00:10:25.450 --> 00:10:28.140
Very good.

00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:28.420
Check.

00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:29.670
Does that include 0?

00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:30.370
Yes.

00:10:30.370 --> 00:10:31.910
Does it have the group
property, even

00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:34.240
plus even is even?

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:36.670
Clearly subtraction holds,
and so forth.

00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:39.560
So this is the subgroup.

00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:44.860
Interestingly, there's a
one-to-one correspondence

00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:47.440
between Z and 2Z, so the
subgroup is as big as the

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:50.420
group itself.

00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:56.940
You get into the whole issue
of transfinite numbers.

00:10:56.940 --> 00:10:58.570
But that's not where
we're headed here.

00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:03.030
OK.

00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:05.390
We'll just keep that
in mind for now.

00:11:05.390 --> 00:11:13.350
Obviously 3Z, 4Z, 5Z, and all
the multiples of n are going

00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:17.390
to be a subgroup of the integers
for any integer n.

00:11:17.390 --> 00:11:21.930
So more generally, we could
take H equals nZ.

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:35.650
What's a coset?

00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:42.450
Coset is also, in the abelian
case, called a

00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:45.306
translate of a subgroup.

00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:59.820
A coset, for instance, is in the
form H plus G for some G

00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:01.070
in the group, not
in the subgroup.

00:12:04.670 --> 00:12:09.730
Now if G is in the subgroup,
we get nothing.

00:12:09.730 --> 00:12:16.970
The coset is just H again by
the group property of H. So

00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:25.700
the interesting cases are where
G is not in H. Let me

00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:27.820
give you some examples.

00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:41.290
Let's take G equals Z10 and
H equals 0,2,4,6,8.

00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:47.720
You might call that 2Z10 It's
the set of all elements which

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:52.050
are twice the elements in Z10.

00:12:52.050 --> 00:12:52.500
OK.

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:54.600
What is a coset?

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:58.180
If I add any element in
this group to H --

00:12:58.180 --> 00:13:01.780
let's add one, for instance.

00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:13.585
So H plus 1 consists of the
elements 1,3,5,7,9.

00:13:13.585 --> 00:13:14.835
Well, that's interesting.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:25.130
That seems to exhaust all
of the elements of Z10.

00:13:25.130 --> 00:13:33.370
Let's take the Z equals the Z10,
and H simply equal to 0

00:13:33.370 --> 00:13:35.550
and 5, which we might
call 5Z10.

00:13:39.650 --> 00:13:42.000
And all right.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.570
Now H plus 0, H plus 5 is
just equal to itself.

00:13:46.570 --> 00:13:50.650
H plus 1 is equal to 1,6.

00:13:50.650 --> 00:13:55.240
H plus 2 is equal to 2,7.

00:13:55.240 --> 00:14:01.040
H plus 3 is equal to 3, 8.

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:10.770
H plus 4 is equal to 4,9.

00:14:10.770 --> 00:14:18.320
So we begin to see some
properties of cosets here for

00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:22.050
which proofs are given
in the notes.

00:14:22.050 --> 00:14:27.760
First of all is that
two cosets are

00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:31.020
either the same or disjoint.

00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:36.760
H plus 2 is the same as H. H
plus 1 is completely disjoint

00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:42.520
from H. Same over here.

00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:49.450
If I had H plus 5, that would
be the same as H. H plus 6

00:14:49.450 --> 00:14:52.360
would be completely disjoint
from H and would be the same

00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:54.300
as H plus 1.

00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:58.650
In fact, I can take any of the
elements of a coset as its

00:14:58.650 --> 00:15:01.630
representative, and I'm going
to get the same coset, take

00:15:01.630 --> 00:15:04.040
any element outside the coset,
and I'll get a completely

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:05.010
distinct coset.

00:15:05.010 --> 00:15:07.370
This follows just very
easily from the

00:15:07.370 --> 00:15:10.610
cancellation property.

00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:11.900
All right?

00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:24.170
So the cosets, the distinct
cosets, form a disjoint

00:15:24.170 --> 00:15:36.780
partition of G. We certainly
have a coset that contains

00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:40.210
every element of G. Just take H
plus that element G. That's

00:15:40.210 --> 00:15:43.870
going to contain G because
H contains 0.

00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:49.990
So there is a coset that
contains every element of G.

00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:54.030
Any two cosets, distinct cosets,
are disjoint, so

00:15:54.030 --> 00:15:56.350
that's what we mean by
a disjoint partition.

00:15:56.350 --> 00:16:00.470
We list all the elements
of G in this way.

00:16:03.130 --> 00:16:09.700
And in the finite case, that
gives us a early famous

00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:14.220
theorem attributed
to Lagrange.

00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:18.600
What does that mean?

00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:35.800
This means that H has to divide
G. If G has size 1,10

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:40.970
and all the cosets have the same
size, by the way, again

00:16:40.970 --> 00:16:43.450
by the cancellation
property --

00:16:43.450 --> 00:16:48.040
this means that G has to consist
of an integer number

00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:53.410
of cosets, all of which have
the size of H. OK?

00:16:53.410 --> 00:16:57.410
And therefore some integer times
H is equal to H, which

00:16:57.410 --> 00:17:01.240
is the same thing as
H divides G. OK?

00:17:13.170 --> 00:17:18.210
If G is a finite group, I mean
by this kind of determinant

00:17:18.210 --> 00:17:22.619
notation, the size of H. The
size of H divides the size of

00:17:22.619 --> 00:17:26.890
G. Or more elegantly, the
cardinality of H divides the

00:17:26.890 --> 00:17:29.350
cardinality of G. But
why say cardinality

00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:32.540
when you can say size?

00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:33.792
I shouldn't have put it here.

00:17:36.990 --> 00:17:41.210
Where H is any subgroup, any
subgroup, of course, that's

00:17:41.210 --> 00:17:44.850
finite is itself
a finite group.

00:17:44.850 --> 00:17:47.630
So that's going to turn out to
be quite a powerful theorem.

00:17:47.630 --> 00:17:51.770
And it just follows this
little exercise.

00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:54.500
And we see it's satisfied,
certainly,

00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:56.680
by these two examples.

00:17:59.270 --> 00:18:06.970
In fact, it's pretty easy to see
that the subgroups of Zm

00:18:06.970 --> 00:18:10.720
are going to correspond to the
divisors of m in the same way.

00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:14.050
We're going to get a subgroup
for every divisor of m, and in

00:18:14.050 --> 00:18:16.375
the case of cyclic groups,
this is the way it's

00:18:16.375 --> 00:18:17.310
going to come out.

00:18:17.310 --> 00:18:18.800
Just pick any divisor.

00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:24.150
You get a subgroup
isomorphic to Zd.

00:18:24.150 --> 00:18:27.970
Again, this is done with
more care in the notes.

00:18:27.970 --> 00:18:30.100
Suppose we have the infinite
case here.

00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:32.920
Suppose we have Z and 2Z.

00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:36.750
So let me draw that case.

00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:41.150
G equals Z. H equals 2Z.

00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:44.970
And all right.

00:18:44.970 --> 00:18:48.400
What's H?

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:58.730
H is the set dot dot dot minus
2,0,2,4, dot dot dot.

00:18:58.730 --> 00:19:06.870
So this is H. And what's H plus
1, or in fact, plus any

00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:08.520
odd number?

00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:11.210
It's going to be the
odd integers.

00:19:11.210 --> 00:19:16.120
H equals minus 1,1,3,5,
and so forth.

00:19:18.790 --> 00:19:26.100
So again, this works in the
infinite case, that the

00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:29.850
distinct cosets form a disjoint
partition of an

00:19:29.850 --> 00:19:33.105
infinite group G. But of
course, we don't get

00:19:33.105 --> 00:19:38.040
Lagrange's theorem as a
corollary, because I already

00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:40.250
said, there's a one-to-one
correspondence between Z and

00:19:40.250 --> 00:19:44.360
2Z, paradoxically.

00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:48.160
So the cardinality of Z
and 2Z are the same.

00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:50.130
More elegant language.

00:19:50.130 --> 00:19:53.070
Nonetheless, you see, this
is a useful partition and

00:19:53.070 --> 00:19:56.220
standard partition
into the even

00:19:56.220 --> 00:19:59.030
integers and the odd integers.

00:19:59.030 --> 00:20:04.990
And we could also write this as
2Z and this is 2Z plus 1.

00:20:04.990 --> 00:20:06.930
So we can divide the
integers into even

00:20:06.930 --> 00:20:08.180
integers and odd integers.

00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:11.350
All right.

00:20:11.350 --> 00:20:18.360
Now we can actually add cosets,
subtract cosets.

00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:21.110
In these cases, we can
even multiply cosets.

00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:23.090
But let's just talk
about staying

00:20:23.090 --> 00:20:25.760
within the group operation.

00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:27.600
Given any abelian --

00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:29.870
let's continue to say
G is abelian --

00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:31.670
how would you add two cosets?

00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:42.060
Coset addition is defined
as follows.

00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:44.730
H plus G --

00:20:44.730 --> 00:20:48.290
we want to have some addition
operation, which I'll just

00:20:48.290 --> 00:20:50.860
indicate by plus --

00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:54.810
H plus G prime, what's
going to equal?

00:20:54.810 --> 00:21:04.065
We define that to equal
H plus G plus G prime.

00:21:07.490 --> 00:21:09.110
And that makes sense.

00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:15.830
I mean, if we really write all
this out, we get H plus H plus

00:21:15.830 --> 00:21:18.940
G plus G prime.

00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:21.490
H plus H is just H again.

00:21:21.490 --> 00:21:24.740
So it's sort of a
proof of that.

00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:29.460
If you go through in detail, any
element of this coset plus

00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:32.330
any element of this coset
is going to be an

00:21:32.330 --> 00:21:34.930
element of this coset.

00:21:34.930 --> 00:21:40.380
So this itself is a coset.

00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:42.680
So we now have an addition
table for cosets.

00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:51.340
So in fact, it's easy to show
that the cosets themselves

00:21:51.340 --> 00:21:56.700
form a group called
a quotient group.

00:21:56.700 --> 00:21:57.950
Start over here.

00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:16.073
Cosets of H in G under
coset addition --

00:22:16.073 --> 00:22:17.323
that's going to be Z --

00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:22.600
form a group.

00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:25.370
We just defined coset
addition.

00:22:25.370 --> 00:22:30.310
And it's easy to check that they
themselves form a group

00:22:30.310 --> 00:22:32.980
called the quotient group.

00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:45.450
Usually written G slash H and
pronounced G mod H. And we can

00:22:45.450 --> 00:22:47.570
can mod out anything.

00:22:47.570 --> 00:22:51.190
We do the arithmetic in these
quotient groups by modding out

00:22:51.190 --> 00:22:54.560
any elements of H.

00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:56.030
And let's take an example.

00:22:56.030 --> 00:22:57.280
Here's a good one.

00:23:04.540 --> 00:23:13.980
For example, the cosets
of 2Z in Z, namely,

00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:18.425
2Z and 2Z plus 1.

00:23:24.050 --> 00:23:25.730
Under coset addition.

00:23:25.730 --> 00:23:28.142
What is coset addition here?

00:23:28.142 --> 00:23:36.330
If I add any even integer to
any even integer, I get an

00:23:36.330 --> 00:23:38.510
even integer.

00:23:38.510 --> 00:23:41.455
Any odd to even, I get
an odd integer.

00:23:41.455 --> 00:23:44.880
Odd to odd gives that.

00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:50.370
I mean, odd to even gives that,
and odd to odd gives me

00:23:50.370 --> 00:23:52.550
back evens again.

00:23:52.550 --> 00:23:55.660
So that's the addition table.

00:23:55.660 --> 00:23:59.690
The subgroup itself,
x is the identity.

00:23:59.690 --> 00:24:08.660
This is clearly isomorphic to
Z2 with this addition table.

00:24:12.420 --> 00:24:16.920
In fact, this is a very good way
of constructing the cyclic

00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:20.660
group Z2, or more
generally, Zn.

00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:27.920
So this would be called
Z mod 2Z.

00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:34.850
And it's isomorphic to Z2, or
in general, Z mod nZ is

00:24:34.850 --> 00:24:36.100
isomorphic to Zn.

00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:44.150
A very good way of thinking of
Zn is as residue classes or

00:24:44.150 --> 00:24:45.780
equivalence classes, modulo n.

00:24:51.810 --> 00:24:54.180
The cosets of nZ.

00:24:54.180 --> 00:25:00.880
are nZ itself, nZ plus 1,
nZ plus 2, up to nZ

00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:05.030
plus n minus 1.

00:25:05.030 --> 00:25:08.780
And if you add them together,
they follow the rules of mod n

00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:09.540
arithmetic.

00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:11.970
If you just add the residues
together and

00:25:11.970 --> 00:25:13.500
then reduce mod n.

00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:19.040
So we can think of
Zn as being --

00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:21.770
a coset is an equivalence
class.

00:25:21.770 --> 00:25:24.160
It's all the elements of the
group that are equivalent,

00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:29.830
modular of the subgroup H. Or in
the case of integers, it's

00:25:29.830 --> 00:25:32.460
all integers that are
equivalent modulo

00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:34.870
the subgroup nZ.

00:25:34.870 --> 00:25:39.280
They have the same remainder
after division by n.

00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:40.370
They have the same residue.

00:25:40.370 --> 00:25:42.765
These are all equivalence
class notions.

00:25:42.765 --> 00:25:45.510
And how do you add them?

00:25:45.510 --> 00:25:50.020
You add them in the ordinary
way, and then you take

00:25:50.020 --> 00:25:52.120
everything modulo m.

00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:56.440
In other words, you do
mod-m arithmetic.

00:25:56.440 --> 00:25:57.090
OK.

00:25:57.090 --> 00:26:05.030
So I didn't quite go to quotient
groups in the notes,

00:26:05.030 --> 00:26:08.130
but perhaps I should have.

00:26:08.130 --> 00:26:13.730
Probably I should have, because
this is maybe the most

00:26:13.730 --> 00:26:19.500
powerful idea in group theory,
and certainly closely related

00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:23.150
to this little bit of number
theory that we're doing in the

00:26:23.150 --> 00:26:25.050
integers mod n.

00:26:25.050 --> 00:26:28.600
And of course, it has
vastly greater

00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:32.390
applications than just that.

00:26:32.390 --> 00:26:32.720
OK.

00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:37.410
And you could do the same
thing over here.

00:26:37.410 --> 00:26:42.910
This is basically doing the
same kind of thing.

00:26:45.890 --> 00:26:48.175
But I won't take time
to do that.

00:26:50.710 --> 00:26:55.470
So here's another view of the
integers mod-n that may be

00:26:55.470 --> 00:26:56.830
helpful as we go forward.

00:27:00.590 --> 00:27:01.120
All right.

00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:05.740
I think that's all I want
to say about that.

00:27:05.740 --> 00:27:07.070
Yeah.

00:27:07.070 --> 00:27:07.490
Good.

00:27:07.490 --> 00:27:08.040
All right.

00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:10.025
Here would be a good place
to start on fields.

00:27:18.580 --> 00:27:19.980
OK.

00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:21.230
Fields.

00:27:22.850 --> 00:27:25.100
Obviously very important
in algebra.

00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:30.490
Fields are like groups,
only more so.

00:27:30.490 --> 00:27:34.580
Groups are a set of elements
with a single operation, which

00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:35.830
we've been calling addition.

00:27:38.310 --> 00:27:42.500
A field is a set of elements
with two operations, which

00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:45.990
we'll call addition and
multiplication.

00:27:45.990 --> 00:27:46.990
So what do we have?

00:27:46.990 --> 00:27:50.720
We have a set of elements F.
We're going to be particularly

00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:53.030
interested where the
set is finite.

00:27:53.030 --> 00:27:55.272
Those are called
finite fields.

00:27:55.272 --> 00:28:00.190
And we're going to have two
operations, which I'll

00:28:00.190 --> 00:28:04.620
continue to write addition by
simple plus and multiplication

00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:07.740
with an asterisk, just to
be very explicit about

00:28:07.740 --> 00:28:08.695
everything.

00:28:08.695 --> 00:28:11.710
And after a while, you can
write these things as you

00:28:11.710 --> 00:28:15.170
would in ordinary arithmetic,
with just ordinary plus and

00:28:15.170 --> 00:28:18.550
juxtaposition for
multiplication.

00:28:18.550 --> 00:28:21.101
And what are the axioms
of a field?

00:28:21.101 --> 00:28:26.870
They're presented in an elegant
way in the notes,

00:28:26.870 --> 00:28:31.650
which obviously go back a long
way, but I got from Bob

00:28:31.650 --> 00:28:34.780
Gallager, and I like.

00:28:34.780 --> 00:28:36.120
All right.

00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:39.590
Under addition --

00:28:39.590 --> 00:28:42.710
so let's write it this way.

00:28:42.710 --> 00:28:47.500
Now, just considering the
addition operation is an

00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:50.720
abelian group.

00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:51.970
Commutative group.

00:28:57.370 --> 00:29:01.470
Which means it has an identity,
and we will continue

00:29:01.470 --> 00:29:05.620
to call that identity 0.

00:29:05.620 --> 00:29:09.970
Just as we do in the real
field, let's say.

00:29:09.970 --> 00:29:10.085
OK.

00:29:10.085 --> 00:29:12.540
Think of the real field, if you
like, as a model for all

00:29:12.540 --> 00:29:15.050
fields here.

00:29:15.050 --> 00:29:16.520
All right.

00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:19.130
So that's axiom one.

00:29:19.130 --> 00:29:22.250
Axiom two.

00:29:22.250 --> 00:29:26.320
If we take the non-zero elements
of the field, which I

00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:32.740
write by F star, explicitly
that's F not including 0 --

00:29:35.295 --> 00:29:38.550
not a very good notation,
but I'll use it --

00:29:38.550 --> 00:29:45.640
and the multiplication
operation, that, too is an

00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:46.890
abelian group.

00:29:52.590 --> 00:29:56.390
So this, of course, is why we
spent a little time on groups,

00:29:56.390 --> 00:30:00.850
abelian groups, so we'd
eventually be able to deal

00:30:00.850 --> 00:30:02.300
with fields.

00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:06.000
And its identity is called 1.

00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:12.300
Meaning that under
multiplication, 1 times

00:30:12.300 --> 00:30:14.445
anything is equal to itself.

00:30:18.030 --> 00:30:24.050
And then we have something
about how the operations

00:30:24.050 --> 00:30:35.450
distribute, the usual
distributive law that A times

00:30:35.450 --> 00:30:44.890
B plus C is equal to A times B
plus D times C, where I've

00:30:44.890 --> 00:30:46.670
written out all of these.

00:30:46.670 --> 00:30:51.290
So this is how addition and
multiplication interact again

00:30:51.290 --> 00:30:53.655
in a way that you're accustomed
to, and after a

00:30:53.655 --> 00:30:55.240
while, you don't need to write
all these parentheses.

00:30:58.770 --> 00:30:58.930
OK.

00:30:58.930 --> 00:31:03.090
So that's actually almost a
simpler set of axioms than for

00:31:03.090 --> 00:31:05.020
groups, once we understand
the group axioms.

00:31:07.830 --> 00:31:10.310
And so let's check.

00:31:10.310 --> 00:31:13.920
Is the real field, is the set
of all real numbers under

00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:15.500
ordinary real addition and

00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:19.955
multiplication, is that a field?

00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:26.040
What do we have to check?

00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:30.730
We have to check that under
addition, we're going to take

00:31:30.730 --> 00:31:33.240
the additive identity
as being equal to 0.

00:31:36.420 --> 00:31:41.800
Under our reduced set of group
axioms, the main thing we have

00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:46.060
to check is if we add any real
number to the reals, we get

00:31:46.060 --> 00:31:49.075
the reals again and the
one-to-one correspondence is

00:31:49.075 --> 00:31:50.355
the permutation.

00:31:50.355 --> 00:31:52.940
Is that correct?

00:31:52.940 --> 00:31:55.280
Yes, it is.

00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:59.840
And so this is OK.

00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:03.540
Now under multiplication, if
we take the non-zero real

00:32:03.540 --> 00:32:07.010
numbers, here's the question.

00:32:09.580 --> 00:32:17.240
If I have some alpha not equal
to 0, is alpha times the

00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:21.570
reals, not including 0 -- the
non-zero real numbers --

00:32:21.570 --> 00:32:23.250
equal to R star?

00:32:23.250 --> 00:32:27.180
And here I'm really implying a
one-to-one correspondence.

00:32:27.180 --> 00:32:29.670
So I might write it
more that way.

00:32:33.730 --> 00:32:39.150
I pose this question rather
abstractly, but you can easily

00:32:39.150 --> 00:32:40.790
convince yourself
that it's true.

00:32:44.270 --> 00:32:48.600
Any non-zero number, if I
multiply it by any non-zero

00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:51.270
number, I get a non-zero
number.

00:32:51.270 --> 00:32:53.480
Is the correspondence
one to one?

00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:59.820
Yes, because I can divide out
this number and get alpha.

00:33:02.810 --> 00:33:13.150
So alpha x on R star by
multiplication to give R star

00:33:13.150 --> 00:33:16.570
again, and this is a one-to-one
correspondence.

00:33:16.570 --> 00:33:19.350
But it's obvious why I have
to leave out 0, right?

00:33:19.350 --> 00:33:21.880
0 times any real number is 0.

00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:29.140
So at O, R star is simply
equal to zero set.

00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:32.360
So we always have to leave out
0 from multiplication.

00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:34.350
0 doesn't have an inverse.

00:33:34.350 --> 00:33:36.740
Everything else does
have an inverse.

00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:38.750
Under the standard group
operations, that's what we

00:33:38.750 --> 00:33:40.890
have to check.

00:33:40.890 --> 00:33:45.850
That would be the alternate
question, does every non-zero

00:33:45.850 --> 00:33:47.780
real number have an inverse?

00:33:47.780 --> 00:33:49.675
That's easier to see,
the answer is yes.

00:33:49.675 --> 00:33:51.810
Multiplicative inverse.

00:33:51.810 --> 00:33:55.568
Inverse of alpha is
1 over alpha.

00:33:55.568 --> 00:33:57.903
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:57.903 --> 00:33:58.530
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:33:58.530 --> 00:34:02.050
I've used the alternative set
of axioms, including the

00:34:02.050 --> 00:34:03.300
permutation property.

00:34:08.940 --> 00:34:11.020
To check whether there's an
abelian group, I've asked if

00:34:11.020 --> 00:34:13.929
alpha R star is the permutation
of R star.

00:34:13.929 --> 00:34:18.770
And without going through
details, I claim it is.

00:34:18.770 --> 00:34:20.020
Thank you.

00:34:22.620 --> 00:34:23.170
All right.

00:34:23.170 --> 00:34:25.159
So we checked that.

00:34:25.159 --> 00:34:27.750
Of course, the distributive
law holds.

00:34:27.750 --> 00:34:33.670
So the real field is a field,
which you probably were

00:34:33.670 --> 00:34:35.115
willing to accept on
faith, anyway.

00:34:37.909 --> 00:34:40.500
Similarly, you go through
exactly the same arguments for

00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:41.750
the complex field.

00:34:45.330 --> 00:34:48.060
What about the binary field?

00:34:48.060 --> 00:34:51.449
We think we understand
that by now.

00:34:51.449 --> 00:34:59.740
Here the operations are mod-2
addition and mod-2

00:34:59.740 --> 00:35:00.905
multiplication.

00:35:00.905 --> 00:35:04.600
I've written down explicitly
the addition and

00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:05.850
multiplication tables.

00:35:11.410 --> 00:35:16.701
Under addition, we simply
have Z2 again.

00:35:19.347 --> 00:35:20.220
F2.

00:35:20.220 --> 00:35:23.446
The additive group of
F2 is simply Z2.

00:35:23.446 --> 00:35:27.030
We forget about multiplication.

00:35:27.030 --> 00:35:31.220
We've seen quite a few times
now that that's a group.

00:35:31.220 --> 00:35:35.580
Under multiplication, what are
the non-zero elements of F2?

00:35:39.910 --> 00:35:41.160
Just one element. one.

00:35:43.870 --> 00:35:46.230
This includes the identity?

00:35:46.230 --> 00:35:48.250
Yes.

00:35:48.250 --> 00:35:50.245
Is it a group?

00:35:50.245 --> 00:35:50.660
Yeah.

00:35:50.660 --> 00:35:51.750
It's a trivial group.

00:35:51.750 --> 00:35:53.160
1 times 1 equals 1.

00:35:56.620 --> 00:36:00.060
1 under multiplication is
isomorphic to the trivial

00:36:00.060 --> 00:36:02.630
group 0 under addition.

00:36:02.630 --> 00:36:07.720
Its group table is
1 times 1 is 1.

00:36:11.750 --> 00:36:13.110
Sure enough.

00:36:13.110 --> 00:36:15.560
That's the identity
permutation.

00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:17.482
Sometimes when things get
too trivial, it's a

00:36:17.482 --> 00:36:18.170
little hard to check.

00:36:18.170 --> 00:36:20.760
But yes.

00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:25.180
And distributive is
easy to check.

00:36:25.180 --> 00:36:26.430
OK?

00:36:28.980 --> 00:36:36.840
So that's all it takes
to define a field.

00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:40.600
Of course, by the inverse
property, when we have

00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:44.940
addition, this also implies an
inverse and a subtraction

00:36:44.940 --> 00:36:49.260
operation and a cancellation
and additive identities.

00:36:49.260 --> 00:36:55.350
We have a field element on both
sides of a plus b equals

00:36:55.350 --> 00:36:58.620
a plus c, then b plus
b equals c.

00:36:58.620 --> 00:37:00.890
That's what I mean
by cancellation.

00:37:00.890 --> 00:37:04.010
Similarly under multiplication,
we get a

00:37:04.010 --> 00:37:05.950
multiplicative inverse.

00:37:05.950 --> 00:37:11.320
1 over alpha, for any alpha in
F. We, therefore, are able to

00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:14.490
define division.

00:37:14.490 --> 00:37:21.880
And we have cancellation for
multiplicative identity.

00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:25.580
So we immediately get a lot from
these group properties.

00:37:25.580 --> 00:37:27.765
We get all the properties
you expect of fields.

00:37:27.765 --> 00:37:30.700
You can add, subtract, multiply,
or divide, all in

00:37:30.700 --> 00:37:32.670
the usual way that we do
over the real field.

00:37:36.900 --> 00:37:38.150
OK.

00:37:40.192 --> 00:37:41.530
Let's stay over here.

00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:51.736
I think my next topic
is prime fields.

00:37:59.990 --> 00:38:00.190
Yes.

00:38:00.190 --> 00:38:01.880
So prime fields.

00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:04.490
When we talked about the
factorization properties of

00:38:04.490 --> 00:38:08.630
the integers, we talked
about primes p.

00:38:08.630 --> 00:38:17.610
And now I'm going to talk about
Fp is going to be a

00:38:17.610 --> 00:38:20.990
field with a finite number
of elements where

00:38:20.990 --> 00:38:24.190
the number is a prime.

00:38:24.190 --> 00:38:27.140
So what are the elements in
this field going to be?

00:38:27.140 --> 00:38:34.890
Are they simply going to be 0,
1 up through p minus 1 again,

00:38:34.890 --> 00:38:40.240
the same elements as were in
the cyclic group with p

00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:44.180
elements where I'm restricting
m now to be a prime p?

00:38:47.100 --> 00:38:54.120
And for my addition operation
and my multiplication

00:38:54.120 --> 00:38:58.650
operation, I'm going to just
let these be mod-p addition

00:38:58.650 --> 00:39:00.613
and multiplication now.

00:39:05.930 --> 00:39:08.680
And I claim that this
is a field.

00:39:14.810 --> 00:39:19.440
So actually, the proof follows
very close to what I

00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:21.620
just did for F2.

00:39:21.620 --> 00:39:22.905
F2 is a model for this.

00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:28.720
But it's a little harder
to check this.

00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:35.710
Under a, under the addition
operation, Fp really is just

00:39:35.710 --> 00:39:39.360
Zp again, so that's OK.

00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:41.840
That's an abelian group.

00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:43.090
Zmod-p.

00:39:45.010 --> 00:39:47.120
Or the quotient group,
Zmod-pZ.

00:39:49.790 --> 00:39:58.110
We can also again think of this
as Zmod-pZ, if we want.

00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:05.080
So everything is going to become
mod-Z. That's a very

00:40:05.080 --> 00:40:06.720
useful way of thinking of it.

00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:09.810
So we're really thinking of
these as remainders or

00:40:09.810 --> 00:40:18.240
representatives of the residue
classes of pZ in Z. This is

00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:24.610
pZ, this is pZ plus 1 up
to Z minus 1, up to pZ

00:40:24.610 --> 00:40:26.450
plus p minus 1.

00:40:26.450 --> 00:40:29.790
This is the same
as pZ minus 1.

00:40:29.790 --> 00:40:30.190
OK.

00:40:30.190 --> 00:40:34.920
The real question is, if we take
the non-zero elements of

00:40:34.920 --> 00:40:42.915
Fp, is this closed?

00:40:46.110 --> 00:40:50.860
And does every element
have an inverse?

00:40:50.860 --> 00:40:54.130
Or equivalently, when we
multiply by a particular

00:40:54.130 --> 00:40:56.400
element, do we just get
a permutation of this?

00:41:00.250 --> 00:41:02.280
The reason that p has
to be a prime --

00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:08.040
let's suppose we take two of
these things, a and b, and we

00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:09.290
multiply them.

00:41:11.820 --> 00:41:13.305
What's the multiplicative
rule?

00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:26.095
a times b is just ab mod-p.

00:41:26.095 --> 00:41:29.380
That's what I defined
multiplication as.

00:41:29.380 --> 00:41:33.660
Now the question is, could
that possibly be 0?

00:41:33.660 --> 00:41:38.530
Which is the same as saying,
could a times b be a multiple

00:41:38.530 --> 00:41:43.760
of p, where a and b are taken
from the non-zero

00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:46.460
elements of the field?

00:41:46.460 --> 00:41:49.970
And here, because p is a prime,
it's clear that you

00:41:49.970 --> 00:41:55.410
can't multiply two non-zero
numbers which are less than p

00:41:55.410 --> 00:41:57.870
and get a multiple
of the prime p.

00:42:02.120 --> 00:42:08.190
If p were not a prime,
then you could.

00:42:08.190 --> 00:42:12.570
If we took n equals 10 again,
let's say, and we multiplied 2

00:42:12.570 --> 00:42:18.390
times 5 from the 10 elements
of these residue classes, 2

00:42:18.390 --> 00:42:25.370
times 5 is, in fact, equal to
0 mod-10, and therefore Fp

00:42:25.370 --> 00:42:30.040
star, or F10 star, would
not be closed under

00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:30.930
multiplication.

00:42:30.930 --> 00:42:32.140
We would get a 0.

00:42:32.140 --> 00:42:35.550
But in this case, we easily
prove, because it's a prime,

00:42:35.550 --> 00:42:37.930
that it's not equal to 0.

00:42:37.930 --> 00:42:42.930
And therefore it's in Fp star,
so it is closed under

00:42:42.930 --> 00:42:44.180
multiplication.

00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:50.050
And the other thing we have to
check is that it's one-to-one.

00:42:50.050 --> 00:43:02.080
In other words, can a star b
equal to a star c, and by the

00:43:02.080 --> 00:43:05.830
cancellation property,
which holds in --

00:43:09.620 --> 00:43:09.930
Sorry.

00:43:09.930 --> 00:43:13.450
We've got to establish the
cancellation property holds

00:43:13.450 --> 00:43:18.140
under mod-b arithmetic, but
it does, and so we get the

00:43:18.140 --> 00:43:20.900
cancellation property, that
this is true if and

00:43:20.900 --> 00:43:23.340
only if b equals c.

00:43:23.340 --> 00:43:28.530
So in other words, as we run
through all of these multiples

00:43:28.530 --> 00:43:31.910
for any particular alpha,
we're going to get a

00:43:31.910 --> 00:43:32.690
permutation.

00:43:32.690 --> 00:43:34.290
We need to get the
same set back.

00:43:34.290 --> 00:43:35.820
Everything is finite.

00:43:35.820 --> 00:43:38.960
We're going to get a bunch of
distinct elements of the same

00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:41.310
size as the set itself.

00:43:41.310 --> 00:43:45.920
Therefore, it has to
be the set again.

00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:47.910
I haven't said that
very well again.

00:43:47.910 --> 00:43:48.980
That's why we have notes.

00:43:48.980 --> 00:43:53.090
It's written up correctly
in the notes.

00:43:53.090 --> 00:43:56.390
But we have basically checked
everything that we need to

00:43:56.390 --> 00:44:01.580
check, showed that Fp star
is an abelian group under

00:44:01.580 --> 00:44:06.690
multiplication when p is a
prime, and clearly not when p

00:44:06.690 --> 00:44:08.085
is not a prime.

00:44:08.085 --> 00:44:10.065
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:10.065 --> 00:44:13.400
the inverse, there
is inverse of a?

00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:14.650
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:44:16.610 --> 00:44:19.950
But basically, we have to prove
that if I take any of

00:44:19.950 --> 00:44:25.790
these, if I take a particular
one, say, alpha, and multiply

00:44:25.790 --> 00:44:31.990
times all of them in Fp star,
that I'm just going to get Fp

00:44:31.990 --> 00:44:34.080
star again.

00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:38.940
And to prove that, I have to
prove that alpha times a is

00:44:38.940 --> 00:44:47.710
not equal to alpha times
b if a not equal to b.

00:44:47.710 --> 00:44:49.700
That's all I need
to prove, right?

00:44:49.700 --> 00:44:52.370
And that comes from the
properties of mod-p

00:44:52.370 --> 00:44:53.000
arithmetic.

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:54.865
That is what is to be proved.

00:44:54.865 --> 00:44:58.232
I need to use mod-p arithmetic
to prove that.

00:44:58.232 --> 00:44:59.482
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:45:03.080 --> 00:45:03.650
PROFESSOR: Oh.

00:45:03.650 --> 00:45:08.050
I have to check the identity
is in here.

00:45:08.050 --> 00:45:09.630
The identity is in here.

00:45:09.630 --> 00:45:10.230
It has one.

00:45:10.230 --> 00:45:10.670
I'm sorry.

00:45:10.670 --> 00:45:12.175
I should have checked
that, too.

00:45:12.175 --> 00:45:15.060
But 1 is the identity
for multiplication.

00:45:15.060 --> 00:45:19.380
And then from this property,
since we multiply alpha p

00:45:19.380 --> 00:45:22.390
star, we get Fp star again.

00:45:22.390 --> 00:45:25.080
That includes one.

00:45:25.080 --> 00:45:25.490
All right?

00:45:25.490 --> 00:45:29.940
So it's got to be one of these
guys which, times alpha, gives

00:45:29.940 --> 00:45:33.200
1, and that shows the existence
of an inverse.

00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:38.080
So you can do it any
way you want.

00:45:38.080 --> 00:45:42.130
But the key to the proof is to
prove this, and that's why I

00:45:42.130 --> 00:45:45.720
focused on the permutation
property.

00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:47.850
Permutation property is
really what you prove

00:45:47.850 --> 00:45:49.100
to demonstrate this.

00:45:53.390 --> 00:45:54.150
OK?

00:45:54.150 --> 00:45:55.900
Good.

00:45:55.900 --> 00:45:58.670
Everyone seems to be following
closely here.

00:45:58.670 --> 00:46:00.335
Any further questions?

00:46:00.335 --> 00:46:03.020
This is important, because
we've got our

00:46:03.020 --> 00:46:05.360
first finite field.

00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:09.640
The integers mod-p are a finite
field of size p for any

00:46:09.640 --> 00:46:11.110
prime state.

00:46:11.110 --> 00:46:15.540
We've got F2, F3, F5,
F7, and so forth.

00:46:19.830 --> 00:46:22.370
OK.

00:46:22.370 --> 00:46:23.855
Further on this subject.

00:46:31.620 --> 00:46:34.670
We have two closely related
propositions.

00:46:34.670 --> 00:46:57.100
One, every finite field with
prime p elements is

00:46:57.100 --> 00:46:58.840
isomorphic to Fp.

00:47:02.230 --> 00:47:05.690
So if you give me a finite
field, you tell me it has p

00:47:05.690 --> 00:47:09.980
elements, I'll show you that
it basically has the same

00:47:09.980 --> 00:47:11.940
addition and multiplication
tables with relabeling.

00:47:16.460 --> 00:47:29.060
And secondly, every finite field
with an arbitrary number

00:47:29.060 --> 00:47:38.970
of elements, for every finite
field, the integers of the

00:47:38.970 --> 00:47:52.330
field form a prime field for
some P. You understand my

00:47:52.330 --> 00:47:55.250
abbreviations.

00:47:55.250 --> 00:47:58.010
And the proofs of these are
very closely related.

00:47:58.010 --> 00:48:05.290
What do I mean by the integers
of a field, of a finite field?

00:48:13.530 --> 00:48:14.150
OK.

00:48:14.150 --> 00:48:20.270
Well, let's start from the
very most basic thing.

00:48:20.270 --> 00:48:21.590
What do we know?

00:48:21.590 --> 00:48:24.730
We know that the field contains
0 and 1, and those

00:48:24.730 --> 00:48:27.760
are going to be two of the
integers of the field.

00:48:27.760 --> 00:48:32.120
So 0 and 1 are in F.

00:48:32.120 --> 00:48:39.060
Let's use the closure
under addition.

00:48:39.060 --> 00:48:44.995
Clearly 1 plus 1 is in F. We're
going to call that 2.

00:48:47.630 --> 00:48:54.420
1 plus 1 plus 1 is in F. We're
going to call that 3.

00:48:54.420 --> 00:48:55.670
And so forth.

00:48:59.620 --> 00:49:04.480
And of course, since the field
is finite, eventually this is

00:49:04.480 --> 00:49:07.240
going to have to repeat.

00:49:07.240 --> 00:49:16.700
And from the fact it repeats,
you're basically going to show

00:49:16.700 --> 00:49:19.920
that at some point, one
of these is going

00:49:19.920 --> 00:49:22.000
to be equal to 0.

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:25.560
So there's going to be some n.

00:49:25.560 --> 00:49:27.690
The first repeat is
going to be n

00:49:27.690 --> 00:49:38.430
equal to 0 in F. OK.

00:49:38.430 --> 00:49:39.870
So that's what I mean
by the integers.

00:49:45.490 --> 00:49:59.260
The integers clearly form a
subgroup of the additive group

00:49:59.260 --> 00:50:02.940
of F, to form a subgroup
under addition.

00:50:09.540 --> 00:50:12.806
And in fact, a cyclic
subgroup.

00:50:12.806 --> 00:50:18.800
I'm skipping over some of the
details here, but that's a

00:50:18.800 --> 00:50:23.240
claim at this point that I
haven't really demonstrated.

00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:27.890
But just from a subgroup
property, let's attack number

00:50:27.890 --> 00:50:30.040
one up here.

00:50:30.040 --> 00:50:35.030
Suppose we have a field with p
elements, and the additive

00:50:35.030 --> 00:50:38.310
group of the field
has p elements.

00:50:38.310 --> 00:50:42.110
It consists of the
same elements.

00:50:42.110 --> 00:50:46.000
And by Lagrange's theorem, what
are the possible orders

00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:47.485
of that subgroup?

00:50:50.090 --> 00:50:52.780
What are the possible number of
elements in that subgroup,

00:50:52.780 --> 00:50:54.980
the sizes of the subgroup?

00:50:54.980 --> 00:50:56.315
The order of a group
is its size.

00:50:59.670 --> 00:51:01.460
Well, it has to divide p.

00:51:01.460 --> 00:51:04.095
There aren't many things
that divide a prime p.

00:51:04.095 --> 00:51:06.710
There's 1 and there's p.

00:51:06.710 --> 00:51:07.140
OK?

00:51:07.140 --> 00:51:12.960
So the subgroup either has
a single element or

00:51:12.960 --> 00:51:15.530
it's all of the group.

00:51:18.040 --> 00:51:21.020
If there's a single element
-- let's to keep an

00:51:21.020 --> 00:51:24.520
open mind here --

00:51:24.520 --> 00:51:31.350
then what that means is that
if I take G and I add it to

00:51:31.350 --> 00:51:33.750
itself, since it's a subgroup,
it has to give an

00:51:33.750 --> 00:51:35.360
element of the group.

00:51:35.360 --> 00:51:39.140
But there is only one element
of the group.

00:51:39.140 --> 00:51:43.590
Let's say G is the single
element in this subgroup.

00:51:43.590 --> 00:51:45.310
I guess it could only be 1.

00:51:45.310 --> 00:51:46.750
Let's start out with one.

00:51:46.750 --> 00:51:50.480
So suppose one is the only
element of the subgroup.

00:51:50.480 --> 00:51:55.560
Then I get the equation 1 plus
1 equals 1, which by

00:51:55.560 --> 00:52:01.090
cancellation implies
that 1 equals 0.

00:52:01.090 --> 00:52:03.250
OK, well, that can't be true.

00:52:03.250 --> 00:52:06.490
In a field the multiplicative
identity is not

00:52:06.490 --> 00:52:08.550
the additive identity.

00:52:08.550 --> 00:52:13.610
So that can't be true.

00:52:13.610 --> 00:52:17.370
That would only be true if we
had a field with one element,

00:52:17.370 --> 00:52:21.340
and fields implicitly always
have at least two

00:52:21.340 --> 00:52:23.470
elements, 0 and 1.

00:52:23.470 --> 00:52:26.300
F2 is the smallest
finite field.

00:52:26.300 --> 00:52:29.390
I suppose we could set up a
single element that sort of

00:52:29.390 --> 00:52:32.590
satisfies all these axioms,
but then, what is the

00:52:32.590 --> 00:52:34.100
multiplicative group?

00:52:34.100 --> 00:52:35.460
All right.

00:52:35.460 --> 00:52:37.660
So this can't happen.

00:52:37.660 --> 00:52:41.710
So that means this subgroup
has to have p elements.

00:52:41.710 --> 00:52:44.370
It has to consist of all the
elements of the field.

00:52:44.370 --> 00:52:47.310
So that means the integers are
all the elements of the field.

00:52:50.600 --> 00:52:58.220
But now the isomorphism, then,
is that this is isomorphic Fp

00:52:58.220 --> 00:52:59.470
under the isomorphism.

00:53:01.560 --> 00:53:05.500
This corresponds to 2, this
corresponds to 3, and so

00:53:05.500 --> 00:53:06.980
forth, in Fp.

00:53:06.980 --> 00:53:12.190
You can see, you know, 2 is 1
plus 1, 3 is 1 plus 1 plus 1,

00:53:12.190 --> 00:53:16.170
so 2 plus 3 is going
to be 5 1's.

00:53:18.690 --> 00:53:22.410
Mod size the field, whenever
this cycles.

00:53:22.410 --> 00:53:25.510
So this is going to
have to be p, and

00:53:25.510 --> 00:53:27.570
basically, that shows --

00:53:27.570 --> 00:53:28.820
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:53:30.670 --> 00:53:33.288
to prove that it is isomorphical
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:53:33.288 --> 00:53:37.536
multiplying 1 plus 1 into
1 plus 1 plus 1.

00:53:37.536 --> 00:53:38.810
But it is typical --

00:53:38.810 --> 00:53:40.240
PROFESSOR: I really
have only used the

00:53:40.240 --> 00:53:41.380
additive property here.

00:53:41.380 --> 00:53:43.884
I don't think multiplication
enters into it.

00:53:47.300 --> 00:53:52.500
OK, here's where the
multiplicative

00:53:52.500 --> 00:53:53.610
property adds in.

00:53:53.610 --> 00:53:59.320
I have to prove not only that
this is isomorphic to Fp as an

00:53:59.320 --> 00:54:11.160
additive group, but the
multiplication tables are

00:54:11.160 --> 00:54:14.690
isomorphic under the
same relabeling.

00:54:14.690 --> 00:54:19.410
So for that, I have to show
that 2 times 3, when I've

00:54:19.410 --> 00:54:22.250
defined 3 and 3 this way, gives
me the same result as

00:54:22.250 --> 00:54:26.500
multiplying 2 and
3 in F p mod-p.

00:54:26.500 --> 00:54:31.530
But again, I could do this just
because sort of mod-p

00:54:31.530 --> 00:54:35.840
commutes with addition
and multiplication.

00:54:35.840 --> 00:54:42.960
If I multiply 1 plus 1, two 1's
times three 1's, so I'm

00:54:42.960 --> 00:54:47.630
going to get six 1's, and that's
exactly what I get in

00:54:47.630 --> 00:54:51.290
Fp, reducing everything mod-p.

00:54:51.290 --> 00:54:57.500
So I have to check that also
to prove this isomorphism.

00:54:57.500 --> 00:55:00.070
And this is done carefully
in the notes.

00:55:00.070 --> 00:55:02.850
The distributive law holds
because the distributive law

00:55:02.850 --> 00:55:07.090
holds for sums of n 1's.

00:55:11.120 --> 00:55:14.680
1 plus 1 times 1 plus 1 plus 1
plus 1, it's going to be the

00:55:14.680 --> 00:55:18.255
same regardless of where you
put it in, how you put the

00:55:18.255 --> 00:55:20.150
parentheses.

00:55:20.150 --> 00:55:20.570
OK.

00:55:20.570 --> 00:55:27.230
So with some sorry hand-waving
here, we've basically given

00:55:27.230 --> 00:55:29.750
the idea of how to prove this.

00:55:29.750 --> 00:55:33.890
It's basically Lagrange that the
additive subgroup has to

00:55:33.890 --> 00:55:42.360
be of size 1 or p, and we prove
quickly that actually p

00:55:42.360 --> 00:55:44.360
is the only case that works.

00:55:44.360 --> 00:55:48.260
And then we extend all the
arithmetic properties by just

00:55:48.260 --> 00:55:51.888
observing they'll hold
for 1 plus 1 plus 1.

00:55:51.888 --> 00:55:52.382
Yeah?

00:55:52.382 --> 00:55:54.852
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:55:54.852 --> 00:55:58.580
the line 1 plus 1 plus
1 like that?

00:55:58.580 --> 00:55:59.830
Might we [UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE]

00:56:03.794 --> 00:56:05.700
1 is equal to 0.

00:56:05.700 --> 00:56:08.270
What is actually
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE]?

00:56:08.270 --> 00:56:11.135
Should we state that 1 has
to be different than 0?

00:56:11.135 --> 00:56:11.560
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:56:11.560 --> 00:56:15.360
I guess I could simply get
around that by stating that

00:56:15.360 --> 00:56:19.270
the multiplicative identity has
to be different from the

00:56:19.270 --> 00:56:20.260
additive identity.

00:56:20.260 --> 00:56:23.710
It clearly follows from this,
and I think I put it as an

00:56:23.710 --> 00:56:28.930
exercise, 0 times any group
element has got

00:56:28.930 --> 00:56:31.600
to be equal to 0.

00:56:31.600 --> 00:56:33.360
So this is how 0 behaves under

00:56:33.360 --> 00:56:37.150
multiplication from these axioms.

00:56:37.150 --> 00:56:40.520
But 1, as the multiplicative
identity, has to satisfy that

00:56:40.520 --> 00:56:45.960
rule, so clearly, 0
cannot equal to 1.

00:56:45.960 --> 00:56:49.250
Unless, in some trivial sense,
there is only one element in

00:56:49.250 --> 00:56:52.580
the groups if there's any
non-zero element.

00:56:52.580 --> 00:56:56.860
So this implies that 0
is not equal to 1.

00:56:56.860 --> 00:56:59.092
Just could have included
that as an axiom.

00:57:02.068 --> 00:57:02.564
Yeah?

00:57:02.564 --> 00:57:07.028
AUDIENCE: Assume a
and b [INAUDIBLE]

00:57:07.028 --> 00:57:08.020
PROFESSOR: Excuse me?

00:57:08.020 --> 00:57:11.530
AUDIENCE: Assume a and
b, [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:57:11.530 --> 00:57:13.620
does not include 0?

00:57:13.620 --> 00:57:14.870
PROFESSOR: Correct.

00:57:17.060 --> 00:57:17.810
Yeah, you're right.

00:57:17.810 --> 00:57:18.440
OK.

00:57:18.440 --> 00:57:25.155
So it follows from this
that 1 is not 0.

00:57:25.155 --> 00:57:26.100
Yeah.

00:57:26.100 --> 00:57:28.740
I'm sorry I don't personally
have a lot of patience for

00:57:28.740 --> 00:57:30.810
these fine details.

00:57:30.810 --> 00:57:33.430
For mathematicians,
it's important to

00:57:33.430 --> 00:57:38.340
keep them all in mind.

00:57:38.340 --> 00:57:41.830
But my effort is to make these
propositions plausible enough

00:57:41.830 --> 00:57:45.800
so that you can believe them,
and you can go back and read a

00:57:45.800 --> 00:57:50.410
real proof and see that the
proof must be correct

00:57:50.410 --> 00:57:53.360
intuitively, without just
mechanically checking it.

00:58:00.070 --> 00:58:02.410
OK.

00:58:02.410 --> 00:58:07.470
Let me just again outline
how this works.

00:58:07.470 --> 00:58:09.260
It's very similar.

00:58:09.260 --> 00:58:12.800
Again, given any finite field,
if we define the integers of

00:58:12.800 --> 00:58:18.870
the field in this way, we show
that eventually they form a

00:58:18.870 --> 00:58:19.930
cyclic group.

00:58:19.930 --> 00:58:22.735
Their cyclic group
is something that

00:58:22.735 --> 00:58:23.820
has a single generator.

00:58:23.820 --> 00:58:25.630
The generator is 1.

00:58:25.630 --> 00:58:30.880
So eventually it has to cycle
for some number n.

00:58:30.880 --> 00:58:35.740
Now could n be a non-prime?

00:58:35.740 --> 00:58:41.110
No, because this is a field, and
if n were non-prime, then

00:58:41.110 --> 00:58:44.040
we would be able to find two
integers that multiplied

00:58:44.040 --> 00:58:47.960
together gave 0.

00:58:47.960 --> 00:58:53.600
And that's forbidden by the
axioms of the field.

00:58:53.600 --> 00:58:59.970
So the only possibility is that
n is a prime, and in that

00:58:59.970 --> 00:59:05.040
case, we have found what's
called a subfield, a subset of

00:59:05.040 --> 00:59:07.960
the elements of the field which
itself is a field under

00:59:07.960 --> 00:59:09.210
the field axioms.

00:59:11.340 --> 00:59:14.050
And the field has p elements,
and we already know that every

00:59:14.050 --> 00:59:19.150
finite field with p elements
is isomorphic to Fp.

00:59:19.150 --> 00:59:25.220
So it can only be that the set
of integers is a subfield

00:59:25.220 --> 00:59:28.030
which is isomorphic to
Fp for some prime p.

00:59:30.670 --> 00:59:31.990
OK?

00:59:31.990 --> 00:59:36.320
So within any finite field,
we're always going to find,

00:59:36.320 --> 00:59:41.090
just by writing out the integers
and seeing how they

00:59:41.090 --> 00:59:44.140
behave under the additive
property that there are

00:59:44.140 --> 00:59:45.390
exactly p of them.

00:59:51.280 --> 00:59:54.490
So every finite field has
a prime called the

00:59:54.490 --> 00:59:55.276
characteristic.

00:59:55.276 --> 00:59:57.370
The prime characteristic
of the field.

00:59:57.370 --> 00:59:59.760
This is defined as the
characteristic.

00:59:59.760 --> 01:00:03.580
The size of the integer subfield
is the characteristic

01:00:03.580 --> 01:00:05.410
of the field.

01:00:05.410 --> 01:00:11.030
And it has an interesting
property, a

01:00:11.030 --> 01:00:12.280
very important property.

01:00:12.280 --> 01:00:17.480
Suppose we take this p and we
multiply it by any field

01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:21.190
element called data
in the field.

01:00:25.310 --> 01:00:28.420
By the distributive law,
this is just equal to

01:00:28.420 --> 01:00:32.110
1 plus 1 plus --

01:00:32.110 --> 01:00:33.780
so what do I mean by this?

01:00:33.780 --> 01:00:37.410
I mean beta --

01:00:37.410 --> 01:00:40.980
whenever I write an integer
times a field element, I mean

01:00:40.980 --> 01:00:46.220
beta plus beta plus
so forth, p times.

01:00:49.880 --> 01:00:56.430
But this is equal to 1 plus 1,
so forth, by the distributive

01:00:56.430 --> 01:01:03.670
law, I guess, times
theta, p times.

01:01:03.670 --> 01:01:04.920
And what is this equal to?

01:01:08.260 --> 01:01:09.290
This is equal to 0.

01:01:09.290 --> 01:01:13.200
So this is equal to 0 times
beta, which fortunately I just

01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:15.585
told you always must equal 0.

01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:21.880
OK.

01:01:21.880 --> 01:01:28.840
So the conclusion is that if
we add any field element to

01:01:28.840 --> 01:01:35.860
itself p times, we're going to
get 0 for all beta in the

01:01:35.860 --> 01:01:39.870
field where p is the
characteristic of the field.

01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:49.560
Now in digital communications,
we're almost always dealing

01:01:49.560 --> 01:01:52.690
with a case where the
characteristic of the field is

01:01:52.690 --> 01:01:53.760
going to be 2.

01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:55.940
The prime subfield is just
going to be the two

01:01:55.940 --> 01:01:57.620
elements 0 and 1.

01:01:57.620 --> 01:02:01.290
1 plus 1 is going to
be equal to 0.

01:02:01.290 --> 01:02:04.450
So subtraction will be
the same as addition.

01:02:04.450 --> 01:02:11.420
And in that particular case, we
will have that the sum beta

01:02:11.420 --> 01:02:14.950
plus beta of any 2 field
elements in a field of

01:02:14.950 --> 01:02:18.930
characteristic two is going
to be equal to 0.

01:02:18.930 --> 01:02:21.910
Just as we had for code words
in binary linear codes.

01:02:25.470 --> 01:02:28.980
Binary linear codes are not
fields, they're vector spaces,

01:02:28.980 --> 01:02:31.160
but it's a similar
property here.

01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:35.900
You add any element of field of
characteristic 2 to itself,

01:02:35.900 --> 01:02:37.300
and you're going to get 0.

01:02:37.300 --> 01:02:41.450
So this shows that addition is
the same as subtraction.

01:02:41.450 --> 01:02:47.290
Beta equals minus beta in a
field of characteristic 0.

01:02:47.290 --> 01:02:50.370
Which is a little bit
more general.

01:02:53.930 --> 01:02:54.025
OK.

01:02:54.025 --> 01:03:00.170
So we have some fields now, and
we find these fields are

01:03:00.170 --> 01:03:05.750
the only field of prime size,
and that every finite field

01:03:05.750 --> 01:03:10.700
has an important subfield
and a prime subfield.

01:03:10.700 --> 01:03:17.290
And that has important
properties, consequences for

01:03:17.290 --> 01:03:19.870
the field itself.

01:03:19.870 --> 01:03:20.550
All right.

01:03:20.550 --> 01:03:22.290
I think that's everything
I want to

01:03:22.290 --> 01:03:27.170
say about prime fields.

01:03:27.170 --> 01:03:31.560
Now we go on to the next
important algebraic object,

01:03:31.560 --> 01:03:32.810
polynomials.

01:03:37.690 --> 01:03:45.160
And again, it's hard to know
just how detailed to be,

01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:51.010
because of course you've all
seen polynomials, and you

01:03:51.010 --> 01:03:54.520
intuitively or formally know
something about their

01:03:54.520 --> 01:03:56.830
algebraic properties,
their factorization

01:03:56.830 --> 01:03:58.630
properties, and so forth.

01:03:58.630 --> 01:04:02.200
So I'm going to go pretty
quickly, and this will be in

01:04:02.200 --> 01:04:03.450
the nature of a review.

01:04:07.350 --> 01:04:08.600
A polynomial --

01:04:12.130 --> 01:04:14.020
maybe the simplest way --

01:04:14.020 --> 01:04:16.650
how do you define
a polynomial?

01:04:16.650 --> 01:04:18.670
What does it look like?

01:04:18.670 --> 01:04:20.760
It looks like this.

01:04:20.760 --> 01:04:29.900
F0 plus F1 times x plus F2 times
x squared, so forth,

01:04:29.900 --> 01:04:33.120
plus Fm times x to the m.

01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:36.800
That's what it looks like if
it's a non-zero polynomial.

01:04:40.010 --> 01:04:40.900
Or even if it's just --

01:04:40.900 --> 01:04:44.800
you could consider all 0
coefficients to be the zero

01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:45.420
polynomial.

01:04:45.420 --> 01:04:51.560
But in general, the convention
is, we write f of x equal to

01:04:51.560 --> 01:04:55.070
that if x is non-zero.

01:04:55.070 --> 01:04:56.730
What are these f's?

01:04:56.730 --> 01:04:58.510
These are called the
coefficients of the

01:04:58.510 --> 01:05:00.050
polynomial.

01:05:00.050 --> 01:05:03.510
And where do they live?

01:05:03.510 --> 01:05:08.160
We need the coefficients to
be in some common field.

01:05:11.680 --> 01:05:15.010
You've often seen these in the
real or complex field.

01:05:15.010 --> 01:05:17.610
Here they're going to
be in finite fields.

01:05:17.610 --> 01:05:19.310
In particular, very
shortly, they're

01:05:19.310 --> 01:05:22.180
going to be prime fields.

01:05:22.180 --> 01:05:26.480
But in general, we'll just
say these f's have

01:05:26.480 --> 01:05:29.290
to be in some field.

01:05:29.290 --> 01:05:37.460
So we're talking about a
polynomial over F where F is

01:05:37.460 --> 01:05:38.590
some field.

01:05:38.590 --> 01:05:40.640
So there's always some
underlying field if there

01:05:40.640 --> 01:05:42.730
isn't a vector space.

01:05:42.730 --> 01:05:46.970
Some similarities between
this and vector spaces.

01:05:46.970 --> 01:05:54.250
And we usually adopt the
convention that Fm is not

01:05:54.250 --> 01:05:55.500
equal to 0.

01:05:57.770 --> 01:05:58.090
All right?

01:05:58.090 --> 01:06:01.110
So we only write the polynomial
out to its last

01:06:01.110 --> 01:06:03.160
non-zero coefficient.

01:06:03.160 --> 01:06:09.520
In general, this could go up
to an arbitrary degree, but

01:06:09.520 --> 01:06:14.240
well, a polynomial, by
definition has a finite

01:06:14.240 --> 01:06:18.120
degree, which means it has
a finite m for which the

01:06:18.120 --> 01:06:21.590
polynomial can be written
in this way.

01:06:21.590 --> 01:06:26.710
And if the Fm is the highest
non-zero coefficient, then we

01:06:26.710 --> 01:06:31.340
say the degree of f of x is m.

01:06:35.450 --> 01:06:41.120
So all polynomials have a finite
degrees, except for 1.

01:06:41.120 --> 01:06:44.820
There is the zero polynomial,
which we have

01:06:44.820 --> 01:06:48.090
to account for somehow.

01:06:48.090 --> 01:06:51.620
And here we'll just call
it f of x equals 0.

01:06:54.270 --> 01:06:56.910
Informally, it's a polynomial,
all of those

01:06:56.910 --> 01:06:59.560
coefficients are 0.

01:06:59.560 --> 01:07:02.600
But we'll just define it
by its properties.

01:07:02.600 --> 01:07:06.280
Zero polynomial plus any other
polynomial is equal to the

01:07:06.280 --> 01:07:10.370
identity under addition
for the polynomials?

01:07:10.370 --> 01:07:12.710
What's the degree of the
zero polynomial?

01:07:17.820 --> 01:07:22.060
Anyone have a definition for
the degree of the zero

01:07:22.060 --> 01:07:23.150
polynomial?

01:07:23.150 --> 01:07:24.350
Is this well-defined?

01:07:24.350 --> 01:07:25.600
Undefined?

01:07:31.320 --> 01:07:32.030
OK.

01:07:32.030 --> 01:07:34.090
Well, I'll suggest to you
that it should be

01:07:34.090 --> 01:07:35.400
defined as minus infinity.

01:07:41.970 --> 01:07:44.630
This actually makes a lot of
things come out nicely, but it

01:07:44.630 --> 01:07:48.990
is on the other hand, you
don't have to do this.

01:07:48.990 --> 01:07:50.770
If you like, you can define
the degree of

01:07:50.770 --> 01:07:53.270
0 to be minus infinity.

01:07:53.270 --> 01:07:54.520
It's just a convention.

01:07:58.450 --> 01:07:58.650
OK.

01:07:58.650 --> 01:08:13.520
So the set of all polynomials
over F0.

01:08:13.520 --> 01:08:14.770
What's x here?

01:08:19.819 --> 01:08:22.250
I've got this thing x.

01:08:22.250 --> 01:08:23.760
What should I think
of this as being?

01:08:23.760 --> 01:08:26.880
Is this an element of a field,
or is it something else?

01:08:32.420 --> 01:08:35.800
In math, it's usually called
an indeterminate.

01:08:35.800 --> 01:08:37.180
It's just a placeholder.

01:08:37.180 --> 01:08:40.930
It's something else we stick
in order to define the

01:08:40.930 --> 01:08:41.285
polynomial.

01:08:41.285 --> 01:08:45.282
It doesn't have a value,
in principle.

01:08:45.282 --> 01:08:52.960
A comment is made in the notes
that with real and complex

01:08:52.960 --> 01:08:56.939
polynomials, you often think
of x as being a real or

01:08:56.939 --> 01:08:57.960
complex number.

01:08:57.960 --> 01:09:00.890
In other words, you evaluate the
polynomial at some alpha

01:09:00.890 --> 01:09:03.810
in the real or the complex field
by just substituting

01:09:03.810 --> 01:09:05.800
alpha for x.

01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:15.729
And in fact, two polynomials are
equal if they evaluate to

01:09:15.729 --> 01:09:18.479
the same value for all the
alphas and they're

01:09:18.479 --> 01:09:22.220
unequal if not true.

01:09:22.220 --> 01:09:24.760
When we get to finite fields,
it's important this be an

01:09:24.760 --> 01:09:26.180
indeterminate.

01:09:26.180 --> 01:09:32.120
Because consider x and x squared
as polynomials over

01:09:32.120 --> 01:09:36.939
the binary field F2.

01:09:36.939 --> 01:09:40.120
What are the values of these?

01:09:40.120 --> 01:09:48.029
We'll call this F1 of x equals
x, F2 of x equals x squared.

01:09:48.029 --> 01:09:56.320
Then F1 of 0 is 0 and
F1 of 1 is 1.

01:09:56.320 --> 01:09:56.670
Right?

01:09:56.670 --> 01:09:59.950
If I evaluate these at field
elements, the two field

01:09:59.950 --> 01:10:02.060
elements, I get 0 and 1.

01:10:02.060 --> 01:10:10.260
F2 of 0 is equal to 0, and
F2 of 1 is equal to 1.

01:10:10.260 --> 01:10:14.550
But these are not the same
polynomial, all right?

01:10:14.550 --> 01:10:20.880
So x is not to be considered
as a field element.

01:10:20.880 --> 01:10:26.180
It's to be considered just as
a placeholder, a way of

01:10:26.180 --> 01:10:27.710
holding up these polynomials.

01:10:27.710 --> 01:10:31.485
It's actually most important
in multiplication.

01:10:31.485 --> 01:10:34.835
But we gather common
terms in x.

01:10:34.835 --> 01:10:36.950
This is the multiplication
rule.

01:10:36.950 --> 01:10:38.840
But it's just something we
introduce to define the

01:10:38.840 --> 01:10:41.170
polynomial.

01:10:41.170 --> 01:10:41.510
All right.

01:10:41.510 --> 01:10:47.870
So the set of all polynomials
over F in x, or in x over F,

01:10:47.870 --> 01:10:53.800
is simply written as F
square brackets of x.

01:10:53.800 --> 01:10:55.570
That's the convention.

01:10:55.570 --> 01:10:59.320
So that's what I will write
when I mean that.

01:10:59.320 --> 01:11:05.640
And it includes all sequences
like this of finite degree,

01:11:05.640 --> 01:11:07.280
starting at 0, ending
somewhere.

01:11:09.870 --> 01:11:12.710
And also the zero polynomial.

01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:19.865
How do you add polynomials?

01:11:22.440 --> 01:11:26.970
Let's talk about the arithmetic
properties of

01:11:26.970 --> 01:11:27.730
polynomials.

01:11:27.730 --> 01:11:28.780
You know how to do this.

01:11:28.780 --> 01:11:36.230
If you have F0 plus F1 plus F2
and so forth, you have some

01:11:36.230 --> 01:11:40.320
other polynomial doesn't have
to be the same degree --

01:11:40.320 --> 01:11:44.720
G of x is G0 plus G1
x, up there --

01:11:44.720 --> 01:11:47.150
how do you add these together?

01:11:47.150 --> 01:11:49.250
Component-wise.

01:11:49.250 --> 01:11:57.850
Sum is F0 plus G0 plus
F1 plus G1 x plus 2x

01:11:57.850 --> 01:12:00.500
squared and so forth.

01:12:00.500 --> 01:12:03.170
That's an example.

01:12:03.170 --> 01:12:08.280
So you basically insert dummy
0's out here above the highest

01:12:08.280 --> 01:12:11.610
degree term in G. You add
them up component-wise.

01:12:11.610 --> 01:12:13.400
The addition operation
is where?

01:12:13.400 --> 01:12:16.080
In this field, you have addition
operation in that

01:12:16.080 --> 01:12:17.970
failed field, so you
can do this.

01:12:17.970 --> 01:12:21.150
And you get some result which
is clearly itself a

01:12:21.150 --> 01:12:22.580
polynomial.

01:12:22.580 --> 01:12:25.680
If all the coefficients are
0, you declare that

01:12:25.680 --> 01:12:27.260
the result is 0.

01:12:27.260 --> 01:12:30.360
Otherwise the result
has some degree.

01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:33.320
If you add two polynomials with
different degree, the

01:12:33.320 --> 01:12:35.400
degree of the resulting
polynomial is going to be the

01:12:35.400 --> 01:12:36.750
higher degree.

01:12:36.750 --> 01:12:39.840
If they have the same degree,
you could get cancellation in

01:12:39.840 --> 01:12:42.960
the highest order term, and get
a result which is of lower

01:12:42.960 --> 01:12:46.530
degree, all the way down to 0.

01:12:46.530 --> 01:12:47.100
All right?

01:12:47.100 --> 01:12:55.730
So addition is component-wise
the degree of the result is

01:12:55.730 --> 01:13:02.890
less than or equal to the max
degree of the components.

01:13:02.890 --> 01:13:04.445
So we do addition.

01:13:04.445 --> 01:13:05.845
How do we do multiplication?

01:13:09.130 --> 01:13:11.960
You all know how to do
polynomial multiplication.

01:13:14.550 --> 01:13:16.300
Example.

01:13:16.300 --> 01:13:24.360
F0 plus F1 of x times
G0 plus G1 of x.

01:13:24.360 --> 01:13:25.170
What do you do?

01:13:25.170 --> 01:13:27.480
You just multiply it
out term by term.

01:13:27.480 --> 01:13:43.530
F0 G0 plus F1 G0 x plus F0 G1
x plus F1 G1 x squared.

01:13:43.530 --> 01:13:45.300
You can combine these
two together.

01:13:48.620 --> 01:13:51.575
And that's your answer, which
clearly is a polynomial.

01:13:58.320 --> 01:14:01.390
So that's one way of doing it,
is multiply out term by term,

01:14:01.390 --> 01:14:03.710
collect the terms.

01:14:03.710 --> 01:14:07.970
The result of this is that what
you get is a convolution

01:14:07.970 --> 01:14:10.640
for each of the coefficients
in the new polynomial.

01:14:10.640 --> 01:14:15.980
You convolve, just by the
ordinary rules of polynomial

01:14:15.980 --> 01:14:20.840
addition, you can basically turn
this around, you convolve

01:14:20.840 --> 01:14:22.750
it, and you'll get these
coefficients.

01:14:22.750 --> 01:14:26.330
This is written out
in the notes.

01:14:26.330 --> 01:14:30.530
So we know how to do polynomial
multiplication.

01:14:30.530 --> 01:14:34.360
What are some of
its properties?

01:14:34.360 --> 01:14:36.310
How is this defined
again in F?

01:14:36.310 --> 01:14:38.370
We see we're now going to need
the multiplicative of

01:14:38.370 --> 01:14:46.110
properties of our field F.
All of these products and

01:14:46.110 --> 01:14:49.210
ultimately convolutions are
performed in F. That's why we

01:14:49.210 --> 01:14:53.070
did these coefficients to be in
a field, so we can do all

01:14:53.070 --> 01:14:55.860
these things.

01:14:55.860 --> 01:14:57.690
All right.

01:14:57.690 --> 01:14:58.940
What are some of
the properties?

01:15:02.930 --> 01:15:08.360
What is the degree of the
product of two polynomials?

01:15:08.360 --> 01:15:12.770
It's going to be the sum
of the degrees, right?

01:15:12.770 --> 01:15:16.650
Provided that both the
polynomials are not 0.

01:15:16.650 --> 01:15:20.790
The highest non-zero term is
clearly going to be a term of

01:15:20.790 --> 01:15:26.450
this kind, and it's going to be
a coefficient of x to the

01:15:26.450 --> 01:15:28.440
sum of the degrees.

01:15:28.440 --> 01:15:32.260
And since F1 and G1 are both
non-zero, by the way we write

01:15:32.260 --> 01:15:35.130
polynomials, them this
highest order term

01:15:35.130 --> 01:15:36.760
is going to be non-zero.

01:15:36.760 --> 01:15:42.080
But we also have to basically
have another rule that 0 times

01:15:42.080 --> 01:15:45.720
f of x is equal to 0.

01:15:45.720 --> 01:15:49.824
So that's the way we
multiply by 0.

01:15:49.824 --> 01:15:53.560
And how does the degree formula
work in this case?

01:15:53.560 --> 01:15:55.360
Well, this is why I defined
the degree of

01:15:55.360 --> 01:15:57.480
0 to be minus infinity.

01:15:57.480 --> 01:16:05.380
So the degree of the product
0 times f of x is --

01:16:05.380 --> 01:16:09.410
I've defined this to be the
degree of 0 plus the

01:16:09.410 --> 01:16:11.260
degree of f of x.

01:16:11.260 --> 01:16:12.130
This is finite.

01:16:12.130 --> 01:16:13.910
This is minus infinity.

01:16:13.910 --> 01:16:18.370
So the sum is minus infinity,
and so it holds.

01:16:18.370 --> 01:16:18.920
OK?

01:16:18.920 --> 01:16:20.980
That's why we defined
the degree of

01:16:20.980 --> 01:16:22.550
0 to be minus infinity.

01:16:22.550 --> 01:16:26.520
We don't have to, but it's just
so that the sum of the

01:16:26.520 --> 01:16:29.890
degrees formula continues
to work, even if we're

01:16:29.890 --> 01:16:32.140
multiplying by 0.

01:16:32.140 --> 01:16:34.550
Is there a multiplicative
identity for polynomials?

01:16:38.170 --> 01:16:38.440
Yeah.

01:16:38.440 --> 01:16:41.600
What is the multiplicative
identity?

01:16:41.600 --> 01:16:42.180
1.

01:16:42.180 --> 01:16:42.660
OK.

01:16:42.660 --> 01:16:49.175
So one times f of x is
equal to f of x.

01:16:51.690 --> 01:16:55.900
So that's one of the properties
of a field.

01:16:55.900 --> 01:16:57.450
Gee.

01:16:57.450 --> 01:17:02.920
The set of all polynomials over
F in x, is this a field?

01:17:02.920 --> 01:17:06.710
Let's go back and check
our field axioms.

01:17:06.710 --> 01:17:10.245
Under addition, does f of
x form an abelian group?

01:17:13.640 --> 01:17:14.740
Does it have the
group property?

01:17:14.740 --> 01:17:16.900
If we add two polynomials, do
we get another polynomial?

01:17:19.460 --> 01:17:24.590
Do we have cancellation, if F1
plus F2 equals F1 plus F3, is

01:17:24.590 --> 01:17:26.320
it necessarily true
that F2 equals F3?

01:17:29.440 --> 01:17:30.390
Yeah, it is.

01:17:30.390 --> 01:17:33.360
In fact, this looks very
much under addition.

01:17:36.480 --> 01:17:39.815
These look like vectors.

01:17:39.815 --> 01:17:42.960
If we confine ourselves to the
set of all polynomials of

01:17:42.960 --> 01:17:46.660
degree m or less,
we can add them.

01:17:46.660 --> 01:17:54.400
And it looks very much like the
vector space f to the m.

01:17:54.400 --> 01:17:59.130
Set of all polynomials of degree
m or less corresponds

01:17:59.130 --> 01:18:04.140
to the vector space Fm, which
does have the group property

01:18:04.140 --> 01:18:07.450
under addition.

01:18:07.450 --> 01:18:12.732
So in fact, for f of x, yes.

01:18:12.732 --> 01:18:16.830
It is an abelian group under
addition with identity being

01:18:16.830 --> 01:18:18.080
the 0 polynomial.

01:18:21.530 --> 01:18:26.030
And all of f of x is an infinite
abelian group.

01:18:26.030 --> 01:18:29.150
If we just take polynomials of
degree m or less and restrict

01:18:29.150 --> 01:18:32.060
Fp to be a finite group, then
there are only p to the m

01:18:32.060 --> 01:18:37.230
elements, and we would have
a finite abelian group.

01:18:37.230 --> 01:18:38.370
OK.

01:18:38.370 --> 01:18:38.950
Well.

01:18:38.950 --> 01:18:44.405
Are the polynomials an abelian
group under multiplication?

01:18:47.350 --> 01:18:49.780
It has an identity.

01:18:49.780 --> 01:18:54.020
It has all the arithmetic
properties you might expect.

01:18:54.020 --> 01:18:55.170
It's commutative.

01:18:55.170 --> 01:18:59.130
f of x times g of x is equal
to g of x times f of x.

01:18:59.130 --> 01:19:00.380
So it's abelian.

01:19:02.610 --> 01:19:05.560
It has cancellation.

01:19:05.560 --> 01:19:08.840
f of x g of x is equal
to f of x h of x.

01:19:08.840 --> 01:19:12.520
That's true if and only if g
of x is equal to h of x.

01:19:16.040 --> 01:19:18.520
Is it missing anything?

01:19:18.520 --> 01:19:19.710
Inverse, right?

01:19:19.710 --> 01:19:21.450
Very good.

01:19:21.450 --> 01:19:22.700
Just like the integers.

01:19:22.700 --> 01:19:24.965
Not all the polynomials
have inverses.

01:19:28.610 --> 01:19:32.808
Which are the polynomials
that do have inverses?

01:19:32.808 --> 01:19:34.058
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:19:37.310 --> 01:19:37.750
PROFESSOR: No.

01:19:37.750 --> 01:19:41.320
There are more than that.

01:19:41.320 --> 01:19:46.983
So now we're getting into
polynomial factorization.

01:19:51.430 --> 01:19:57.100
And the particular topic
is units, which are the

01:19:57.100 --> 01:19:58.350
invertible polynomials.

01:20:06.870 --> 01:20:08.120
And what are they?

01:20:10.294 --> 01:20:11.970
Does the 0 polynomial
have an inverse?

01:20:20.960 --> 01:20:22.210
We're a little unsure, are we?

01:20:24.836 --> 01:20:28.045
What could it possibly be?

01:20:28.045 --> 01:20:30.230
If it had an inverse,
this would mean 0

01:20:30.230 --> 01:20:34.510
times f of x is --

01:20:34.510 --> 01:20:39.450
well, 0 times f of x would have
to be a one-to-one map to

01:20:39.450 --> 01:20:42.590
all of f of x.

01:20:42.590 --> 01:20:44.280
But it isn't.

01:20:44.280 --> 01:20:46.450
It simply maps to 0.

01:20:46.450 --> 01:20:50.270
Doesn't have an inverse.

01:20:50.270 --> 01:20:55.520
What about the non-zero
polynomials

01:20:55.520 --> 01:20:56.520
that have degree 0?

01:20:56.520 --> 01:21:06.270
In other words, the degree
0 polynomial, is simply

01:21:06.270 --> 01:21:10.650
something that looks like this.
fx equals f0, where f0

01:21:10.650 --> 01:21:11.900
is not equal to 0.

01:21:16.400 --> 01:21:19.386
Is that invertible?

01:21:19.386 --> 01:21:22.600
Yeah, because f0 is in the
field, and it has an inverse.

01:21:22.600 --> 01:21:29.930
So this has inverse 1 over f of
x, if you like, equals just

01:21:29.930 --> 01:21:31.340
f0 minus 1.

01:21:31.340 --> 01:21:32.950
1 over f0.

01:21:38.880 --> 01:21:40.810
By the rules, you multiply
these two

01:21:40.810 --> 01:21:42.085
things, and you get 1.

01:21:48.630 --> 01:21:49.810
OK.

01:21:49.810 --> 01:21:53.280
So the units in this --

01:21:53.280 --> 01:21:54.710
well, I'm sorry.

01:21:54.710 --> 01:21:58.460
Take a degree 1 or a higher
polynomial --

01:21:58.460 --> 01:21:59.710
does that have an inverse?

01:22:03.640 --> 01:22:06.535
Let's suppose we take a
degree 1 polynomial --

01:22:10.680 --> 01:22:16.000
say, F0 plus F1 x --

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.010
and what I want to find
is its inverse.

01:22:21.160 --> 01:22:24.010
Let's call it g of x.

01:22:24.010 --> 01:22:26.610
Is it possible to find a g of
x such that the product of

01:22:26.610 --> 01:22:27.860
these two is 1?

01:22:35.400 --> 01:22:39.170
Clearly not, because by our
degree rule, what is the

01:22:39.170 --> 01:22:41.850
degree of this product
going to be?

01:22:41.850 --> 01:22:45.720
The degree is going to be the
sum of this degree plus this

01:22:45.720 --> 01:22:50.200
degree, the degree of f plus
the degree of g, which is

01:22:50.200 --> 01:22:53.850
going to have to
be at least 1.

01:22:53.850 --> 01:22:56.780
Provided that g of x is not 0,
but clearly g of x is not the

01:22:56.780 --> 01:22:59.600
solution we're looking
for here, either.

01:22:59.600 --> 01:23:08.910
So this can't be true, and the
invertible polynomials are the

01:23:08.910 --> 01:23:17.850
degree 0 polynomials, which
means they're basically the

01:23:17.850 --> 01:23:24.050
non-zero elements of F. Yes.

01:23:24.050 --> 01:23:25.150
Considered as polynomials.

01:23:25.150 --> 01:23:26.785
AUDIENCE: And how are the
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE]?

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:33.690
PROFESSOR: Yes, indeed.

01:23:33.690 --> 01:23:34.940
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:23:37.920 --> 01:23:38.610
PROFESSOR: Ah, no.

01:23:38.610 --> 01:23:43.560
We haven't introduced modulo
polynomials and right.

01:23:48.010 --> 01:23:53.480
The powers and the indices are
the integers from 0 up to some

01:23:53.480 --> 01:23:54.730
finite number.

01:23:57.170 --> 01:23:58.160
OK.

01:23:58.160 --> 01:23:59.790
It's time to quit.

01:23:59.790 --> 01:24:02.750
We'll finish this.

01:24:02.750 --> 01:24:06.400
We'll, I believe, to be able
to certainly finish chapter

01:24:06.400 --> 01:24:10.140
seven, maybe get a little bit
into chapter eight, next time,

01:24:10.140 --> 01:24:12.945
on Wednesday.

01:24:12.945 --> 01:24:14.195
And we'll see you then.

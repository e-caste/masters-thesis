WEBVTT

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:10.870
PROFESSOR: OK, let us resume.

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:15.040
I had no idea how many people
would be here today, and I

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.770
think I made 25 copies
of the handout.

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:22.800
And I see 25 names
on the list.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.490
And that means that two
people did not get

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:26.970
a copy of the syllabus.

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.220
Does anybody need a copy?

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.180
That's strange.

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.430
OK.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:36.760
All right.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.740
We covered some introductory
material, and I think we've

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.080
covered enough that you
can do a problem set.

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.270
So it gives me great pleasure
to hand out

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:45.670
problem set number one.

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.330
OK, you can think about that.

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.570
It is the sort of problem that
will either take you two

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.690
minutes or two hours
or infinity.

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:14.310
So don't spend too much time on
it, but I would like you to

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.290
put your name on it and turn it
in either at the end of the

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:20.960
hour or next time so I can
make comments if there's

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.970
something that's mostly right
but not quite right.

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:40.430
Let's return to these three
simple patterns that we put on

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:41.450
the blackboard.

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.700
And let me make another
point about symmetry.

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:53.430
The people who sensed that this
pattern and the one on

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.960
the bottom were the same because
they had the same

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.070
motif in them, that they had
the same rectangle with one

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:02.530
concave side.

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:08.830
And I drew a mirror line in here
because that locus, when

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.590
I review this is a reflection
from left to right, left the

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:18.720
motif, as well as the entire
pattern, unchanged upon making

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.610
that transformation.

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.860
Is there not also a
mirror line there?

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.760
Worked for this motif.

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.370
Why not for this motif?

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:35.710
Well, the answer is no, that
this is not a mirror line

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:39.550
because the symmetry
transformations acts on

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.850
everything, and not just one
little bit of space.

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:46.980
And if I would take this
chain of objects that's

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.880
translationally periodic with
a translation running this

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.970
way, and I reflected that, I
should have another chain

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.930
running like this.

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.560
So the direction of the
translation vector is not left

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.920
invariant by this reflection.

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:08.040
So the conclusion here, and it's
a subtle one, matter of

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.580
definition, almost, is that
the transformation, the

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:15.260
symmetry transformation, if
it's to be a symmetry

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:35.170
transformation, acts on all of
the space, and not just on one

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:37.940
local domain.

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:43.930
So let me give you an example
of a pattern that doesn't

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:45.960
involve translational
periodicity.

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:51.630
So let me try to make a star
as carefully as I can.

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.740
What sort of symmetric does that
have, or would it have

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:59.010
had I drawn it more perfectly?

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.900
Well, that would be a five-fold
rotation axis in the

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.180
middle because I could
rotate through one

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:06.430
fifth of the circle.

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:12.960
And any of those rotations twice
or three times, or just

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:16.959
2 pi over five, would be
something that maps the

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:19.420
pattern into congruence
with itself.

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:23.720
There are also mirror lines that
go from one tip of the

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.640
star to the other end.

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:30.280
So that is an example of a
pattern, non-periodic, but one

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.410
that has five-fold rotational
symmetry and mirror symmetry.

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:40.040
Now, if I put that star in a
box and ask, what is the

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.420
symmetry of that space?

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:45.520
There's only one operation which
is common to the star

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.990
and to the enclosing rectangle,
and that's this

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:49.240
mirror plane.

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:56.880
So the symmetry acts not just
on one little part of the

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.580
space, but it has to leave
everything invariant.

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:03.990
So in that sense, going to this
pattern here, this is not

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:06.800
a mirror plane because it
doesn't leave the entire

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.760
pattern invariant.

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:11.690
That plane would reflect this
one up to here, and we don't

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:12.830
have anything there.

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:14.620
So the space is not
left invariant.

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:25.510
One further definition.

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:29.960
We defined what we mean when
we say a space or an object

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:31.220
has symmetry.

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:35.120
We said an object or a space
possesses symmetry when there

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:38.540
is an operation, or set of
operations, that maps the

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:41.900
space or the object into
congruence with itself.

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:44.950
Let me make another definition,
and that a

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:46.200
symmetry element--

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:56.060
another bit of terminology--

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:59.440
is the locus of points that's
left unmoved by the operation.

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:08.620
Left unmoved or left
invariant.

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:32.670
So for some specific examples,
this vertical line is a locus

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:36.760
which is left invariant by
either the five-fold rotation

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:46.900
or any of the mirror planes
passing through the points

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:49.460
that would be true
of the star.

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:53.060
So for the star, these are
all symmetry elements.

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:57.340
For the net combination of the
star and the enclosing

00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:01.630
rectangle, the only thing
that leaves a space

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:03.050
invariant is this line.

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:05.670
The locus that's left and moved
is this line, so we

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:07.350
refer to that as
a mirror plane.

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:20.680
Now, these may be seeming
kind of definitions.

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:23.230
Nice to have, but what
use are they?

00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:26.100
We will use some of these
definitions to answer a

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:29.110
question which may
seem tricky.

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:32.780
If we do a couple of things in
sequence, for example, what is

00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:36.360
the net consequence of doing,
let's say, a rotation combined

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:38.270
with a reflection?

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:40.480
You can answer that question
by saying, what

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:42.720
has been left unmoved?

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:46.220
And that is the locuses of
whatever net transformation

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:48.720
results from a combination
of two or more.

00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:55.510
So that, again, is abstract, but
we'll use that later on.

00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:57.420
Any question on this?

00:07:57.420 --> 00:08:00.370
Let me summarize very quickly
what we have found for two

00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:02.550
dimensions.

00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:05.350
We found that there are, in a
two-dimensional space, three

00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:07.240
kinds of operations.

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:14.720
There is the operation of
translation, which we'll call

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:16.890
by the vector, T, corresponding
to that

00:08:16.890 --> 00:08:18.310
transformation.

00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:20.990
And there is an operation
of reflection.

00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:26.880
And the locus of the plane, in
which the reflection occurs,

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:28.730
we'll call a mirror plane.

00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:30.260
And that's a linear locus.

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:33.650
And then, we've seen in these
two patterns here an operation

00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:35.309
of rotation.

00:08:35.309 --> 00:08:37.990
In particular, in these
two-dimensional patterns, we

00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:41.027
saw the rotation
operation A pi.

00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:50.880
Now, I would put forth for your
consideration something

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:54.330
that is a profound conclusion.

00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:58.850
These are the only single-step
transformations that can exist

00:08:58.850 --> 00:09:02.090
in a two-dimensional space.

00:09:02.090 --> 00:09:04.850
These are the only ones that
can exist as single-step

00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:07.720
operations.

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:11.400
We can view these as operations
that result in a

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:15.280
transformation of coordinates.

00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:19.910
And in two dimensions, if we
have some position, x, y, in

00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:23.160
the space, what the
transformation of a

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:29.310
translation does is to take x
and add a constant to it.

00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:34.680
It takes y and adds, perhaps,
a different constant to it.

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:38.680
Do the operation a second time,
and we'll go to x plus

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:40.740
2a and y plus 2b.

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:50.320
So analytically, we can look at
these symmetry operations

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:54.210
in terms of the transformation
of a representative

00:09:54.210 --> 00:09:55.840
coordinate.

00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:59.140
If we have a reflection plane,
and let's set up a coordinate

00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:03.820
system where this is
y and this is x.

00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:08.730
We have an object here at the
location x, y, and we reflect

00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:11.180
it across this locus.

00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:17.640
It goes to minus x, y, if the
mirror line runs through the

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:20.260
origin and is perpendicular
to x.

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:23.850
So one example of a
transformation by reflection

00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:29.340
is that x, y goes
to minus x, y.

00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:33.420
And this is a case where the
mirror plane is perpendicular

00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:36.340
to x and passes through
the origin.

00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:49.890
If we do the operation a second
time, minus x, y would

00:10:49.890 --> 00:10:53.170
get mapped back into
x, y again.

00:10:53.170 --> 00:10:56.090
It comes back to where
it started from.

00:10:56.090 --> 00:10:57.740
So this would be the
first reflection.

00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:02.155
This would be the second
reflection.

00:11:08.410 --> 00:11:11.960
And we saw in the patterns
an example of one other

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:14.150
transformation.

00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:17.970
Let's suppose there was an
operation, A pi, at the

00:11:17.970 --> 00:11:21.850
origin, and this was
x, and this was y.

00:11:21.850 --> 00:11:25.090
We started out with a
motif here at x, y.

00:11:25.090 --> 00:11:29.620
If we rotated that by 180
degrees, it would go down to a

00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:36.040
location minus x, minus y.

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:42.780
So the operation of a 180-degree
rotation is going

00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:46.180
to analytically correspond to a
transformation of going from

00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:49.890
x, y to minus x, minus y.

00:11:49.890 --> 00:11:53.170
If we perform it again, it
would go back to x, y.

00:11:55.890 --> 00:11:59.070
OK, let's look at this in
more general terms.

00:11:59.070 --> 00:12:01.950
In a two-dimensional space,
we've got two dimensions to

00:12:01.950 --> 00:12:03.730
diddle with.

00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:06.520
We can change the sense
of no coordinate.

00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:08.190
That's translation.

00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:11.280
We can change the sense
of one coordinate.

00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:13.280
That's going to be reflection.

00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:16.370
We can change the sense
of both coordinates.

00:12:16.370 --> 00:12:19.740
That's going to be a rotation.

00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:21.070
That's all we can do.

00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:23.900
So these are the three
basic operations in a

00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:25.150
two-dimensional space.

00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:34.870
I gave you special cases to
make things easy, but

00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:38.900
regardless of where the mirror
plane is, parallel to or

00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:42.160
perpendicular to an axis or
not, and whether it passes

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:46.930
through the origin or not, a
mirror plane has the operation

00:12:46.930 --> 00:12:50.570
of reversing the sense
of one direction.

00:12:50.570 --> 00:12:53.320
Just the sense of one direction
that is reversed.

00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:56.450
And the rotation, be it a
rotation through 60 degrees or

00:12:56.450 --> 00:13:00.700
90 degrees or 180 degrees,
is always taking both

00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:01.470
coordinates.

00:13:01.470 --> 00:13:04.590
It's making a transformation
of both coordinates.

00:13:04.590 --> 00:13:06.770
If you only have two coordinates
with which to

00:13:06.770 --> 00:13:08.750
play, that's all you can do.

00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:15.120
Let's do some giant
extrapolations.

00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:18.510
If we have a strictly
one-dimensional pattern where

00:13:18.510 --> 00:13:21.560
there's x and nothing else, than
they're only going to be

00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:22.860
two coordinates.

00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:25.920
And there are going to be only
two ways we can transform

00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:26.520
coordinates.

00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:36.570
So in a one-dimensional space,
we can change the sense of no

00:13:36.570 --> 00:13:43.410
coordinate, and that's going
to be the operation of

00:13:43.410 --> 00:13:52.170
translation, or we can change
the sense of one coordinate,

00:13:52.170 --> 00:13:56.220
and that's going to be the
operation of reflection.

00:13:56.220 --> 00:13:58.460
No rotation in a one-dimensional
space.

00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:03.930
Now, let's extrapolate in
the other direction.

00:14:03.930 --> 00:14:06.750
In a three-dimensional space,
the sort that we're going to

00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:10.190
be concerned with when we want
to describe the symmetry of

00:14:10.190 --> 00:14:16.220
real crystals, you've got three
coordinates to permute.

00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:22.820
So it follows then, without
saying what they are, in 3D,

00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:29.715
there are going to be four
distinct one-step operations.

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:43.086
And then five dimensions?

00:14:43.086 --> 00:14:45.060
Hey, that's a nice thing
about mathematics.

00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:47.030
You could play any
game you like.

00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:49.680
Not only that, but you
make up the rules.

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:51.900
In a five-dimensional space,
there's going to be six

00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:54.050
transformations.

00:14:54.050 --> 00:14:56.850
Would we ever want to worry
about five-dimensional

00:14:56.850 --> 00:14:59.090
crystallography?

00:14:59.090 --> 00:15:02.850
Well, let me hang out a teaser
and not answer the question.

00:15:02.850 --> 00:15:06.980
Yeah, there are crystals
for which as many as

00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:12.200
six-dimensional symmetries
are necessary.

00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:12.870
Wow.

00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:14.130
Doesn't that blow the mind?

00:15:14.130 --> 00:15:18.190
We'll return to that, and I'll
explain why later on.

00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:27.770
Another thing you might ask,
why did I sneak this in?

00:15:27.770 --> 00:15:31.150
Why did I say one-step
operation?

00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:33.190
Well, it's something we should
worry about, and

00:15:33.190 --> 00:15:34.750
unfortunately, we will.

00:15:34.750 --> 00:15:39.880
What if you take a motif,
translate it, rotate it around

00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:43.550
a couple of times, reflect it,
bounce it up and down three

00:15:43.550 --> 00:15:46.880
times, and then put it down?

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:50.780
How do you get from the first
motif to the final one there?

00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:54.520
Is there an infinite number
of operations?

00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:55.650
Mercifully, no.

00:15:55.650 --> 00:15:59.570
The number is small
and very finite.

00:15:59.570 --> 00:16:03.460
And we will systematically, in
another week's time, examine

00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:06.470
specifically two-step
operations.

00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:10.630
And as with many things that
we'll encounter, we might not

00:16:10.630 --> 00:16:12.610
be clever enough to
think them up.

00:16:12.610 --> 00:16:15.180
But when we start putting
things together into a

00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:17.980
synthesis, suddenly we're
going to stumble over

00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:21.440
something we don't know how to
explain, and we will have

00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:25.690
arrived, like it or not, at a
new feature which we perhaps

00:16:25.690 --> 00:16:26.940
hadn't anticipated.

00:16:29.430 --> 00:16:31.080
OK, any question
at this point?

00:16:35.370 --> 00:16:38.730
All this has been in a way
of general introduction.

00:16:38.730 --> 00:16:45.260
We're going to now take things
more slowly and proceed one

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:46.510
step at a time.

00:16:57.570 --> 00:17:06.790
I would like to confine our
attention for the moment on

00:17:06.790 --> 00:17:10.920
two-dimensional symmetries and
examine the sorts of patterns

00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:13.990
that can exist in two
dimensions, fabric patterns,

00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:17.900
floor tile, grillwork,
and so on.

00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:20.880
And we've seen that, basically,
there seem to be

00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:24.150
three operations, three kinds
of operations, translation,

00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:26.750
reflection, and rotation.

00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:30.330
That's an infinite number of
operations because we are not

00:17:30.330 --> 00:17:34.140
specifying whether or not the
rotation angle is restricted

00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:35.940
to any particular value.

00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:38.290
No reason why it should be.

00:17:38.290 --> 00:17:40.155
There are lots of rotational
symmetries that

00:17:40.155 --> 00:17:42.590
are absolutely lovely.

00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:44.580
But let's build things up.

00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:48.190
And I would like to first
look at the operation of

00:17:48.190 --> 00:17:53.410
translation, which we've
said a great deal

00:17:53.410 --> 00:17:56.430
about to this point.

00:17:56.430 --> 00:18:00.090
Translation has magnitude.

00:18:00.090 --> 00:18:01.060
It has direction.

00:18:01.060 --> 00:18:02.590
So it acts like a vector.

00:18:02.590 --> 00:18:06.650
But just like a vector, it
has no unique origin.

00:18:06.650 --> 00:18:11.660
Perform the operation twice, and
you have a position that

00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:14.740
is two translations removed
from the origin.

00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:17.220
Do it three times, you
have a translation

00:18:17.220 --> 00:18:21.090
that's three times out.

00:18:21.090 --> 00:18:25.310
If a motif sits here, the motif
must sit at the end of

00:18:25.310 --> 00:18:27.830
this translation in the same

00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:30.190
orientation parallel to itself.

00:18:30.190 --> 00:18:33.200
It must exist at the end
of two translations.

00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:37.750
And if the operation acts on all
of the space, if we say a

00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:42.130
translation is present, we
really imply that there's an

00:18:42.130 --> 00:18:44.710
infinite row going to
plus infinity and

00:18:44.710 --> 00:18:46.490
back to minus infinity.

00:18:46.490 --> 00:18:49.570
And there is a motif hanging
at the terminal

00:18:49.570 --> 00:18:51.135
point of every vector.

00:18:56.320 --> 00:19:03.350
Now, we can summarize this
periodicity with

00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:06.050
a convenient device.

00:19:06.050 --> 00:19:11.940
Let's take some fiducial
point and summarize the

00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:18.150
translational periodicity by
saying that something that is

00:19:18.150 --> 00:19:28.580
hung at one point, either here,
or maybe hung also off

00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:32.360
in some other direction relative
to the translation,

00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:36.840
that something hung on one of
these points is automatically

00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:39.910
reproduced for us
at every point.

00:19:39.910 --> 00:19:43.510
So what we have done through
this device is defined

00:19:43.510 --> 00:19:45.810
something that is called
a lattice point.

00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:54.480
And this is an abstraction of
the translational periodicity.

00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:58.690
There is an array of points,
geometric fictions, which we

00:19:58.690 --> 00:20:01.150
have constructed.

00:20:01.150 --> 00:20:04.730
And we ascribe to this geometric
fiction the property

00:20:04.730 --> 00:20:09.190
that anything hung at one of
these points, be it a benzene

00:20:09.190 --> 00:20:13.910
ring or be it a Santa Claus on
Christmas wrapping paper, is

00:20:13.910 --> 00:20:17.960
understood to be automatically
reproduced at every other one

00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:21.240
of these points.

00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:27.720
It is this array of fictitious
points that is the proper

00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:33.110
designation of what we refer
to as a lattice.

00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:37.460
So a lattice is an array of
fictitious points that

00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:41.990
summarizes the translational
periodicity of the crystal.

00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:45.150
It has a property to repeat
that something hung at a

00:20:45.150 --> 00:20:48.430
particular disposition relative
to that point and

00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:52.590
with a particular orientation
is understood to be hung at

00:20:52.590 --> 00:20:56.750
every other lattice point
in exactly the same way.

00:20:56.750 --> 00:20:58.040
So that is a lattice.

00:20:58.040 --> 00:21:01.100
And this is one of the
most abused terms in

00:21:01.100 --> 00:21:02.880
crystallography.

00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:06.290
We talk about the sodium
chloride lattice.

00:21:06.290 --> 00:21:10.970
The sodium chloride lattice is
a set of points that are

00:21:10.970 --> 00:21:14.740
placed at the corners
of a cube and in the

00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:16.820
middle of all the faces.

00:21:16.820 --> 00:21:18.460
This is the NaCl lattice.

00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:26.420
If I choose to decorate that
lattice with one sodium and

00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:29.180
one chlorine, then I have
atoms sitting at

00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:31.240
these lattice points.

00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:34.810
And that is the sodium
chloride structure.

00:21:34.810 --> 00:21:38.540
That is the proper term for
the atomic configuration.

00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:45.170
So lattice is a geometrical
term, and it's an abstraction.

00:21:45.170 --> 00:21:49.320
Structure is the actual
atomic arrangement.

00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:53.990
Now, since I realize already
that I am among friends, I can

00:21:53.990 --> 00:21:57.580
confess that I very
often recklessly

00:21:57.580 --> 00:21:58.820
abuse the term lattice.

00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:03.140
If I talk about lattice energy,
lattice diffusion,

00:22:03.140 --> 00:22:07.140
lattice vibration, I'm not
talking about abstract points

00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:11.380
bobbling around or something
going through this array of

00:22:11.380 --> 00:22:12.710
little points.

00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:16.060
I mean, I should talk about
structure diffusion, structure

00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:18.490
energy, structure vibration.

00:22:18.490 --> 00:22:22.190
But man, that just doesn't
have the established

00:22:22.190 --> 00:22:26.000
terminology, and it doesn't
have the zing and music of

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.060
something like lattice
vibrations.

00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:30.240
So I do it all the time.

00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:33.740
Don't tell anybody else that I
said this to you, frankly.

00:22:33.740 --> 00:22:36.550
But it's never going
to be stamped out.

00:22:36.550 --> 00:22:41.450
But now you perhaps are informed
enough to at least

00:22:41.450 --> 00:22:44.750
blush slightly when you talk
about lattice energy or

00:22:44.750 --> 00:22:48.330
lattice diffusion, realizing
you're using the term

00:22:48.330 --> 00:22:50.990
incorrectly and that you know
better, but everybody else

00:22:50.990 --> 00:22:53.430
does it, so you do
the same thing.

00:22:53.430 --> 00:22:55.210
So that is the definition
of lattice.

00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:04.980
Now, suppose I take this space,
to which I've added a

00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:13.630
first translation, and I'll call
it T1, implying that I'm

00:23:13.630 --> 00:23:16.030
going to add something
else to this space,

00:23:16.030 --> 00:23:17.870
which I'm free to do.

00:23:17.870 --> 00:23:21.590
I can put in a second
translational periodicity

00:23:21.590 --> 00:23:24.260
because this is a
two-dimensional space.

00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:25.250
How do I do this?

00:23:25.250 --> 00:23:29.590
And the answer is very carefully
because the second

00:23:29.590 --> 00:23:34.400
translation could not go in
the space parallel to the

00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:38.890
first one if I put in a second
translation, T2, which is

00:23:38.890 --> 00:23:42.301
totally incommensurate
with T1.

00:23:42.301 --> 00:23:44.890
The things blow up in my face.

00:23:44.890 --> 00:23:46.550
I don't have a lattice.

00:23:46.550 --> 00:23:49.540
I will get lattice points
all over the place.

00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:51.100
So this is impossible.

00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:59.125
So if T1 is not equal to T2,
this space self destructs.

00:24:02.090 --> 00:24:07.070
If T1 is a multiple of T2, then
if I say a translation

00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:12.380
exists of length T1, and I add a
second translation twice T1.

00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:13.990
I've already got those
lattice points.

00:24:13.990 --> 00:24:15.880
And that's nothing new.

00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:18.400
So if I want to say there's
a second translational

00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:22.820
periodicity in the space, the
only thing I can do is pick a

00:24:22.820 --> 00:24:27.200
T2 which is not parallel
to T1.

00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:30.120
And then this T2 will pick up
everything in the space.

00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:33.770
It's going to take these lattice
points and generate

00:24:33.770 --> 00:24:35.890
them at equal intervals, T2.

00:24:35.890 --> 00:24:39.360
But for that matter, it acts
on everything in the space.

00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:44.350
So we could think of this
translation, T2, as moving

00:24:44.350 --> 00:24:48.610
this entire infinite string of
lattice points separated by T1

00:24:48.610 --> 00:24:55.330
and giving me a whole string
of lattice points.

00:24:57.990 --> 00:25:09.690
So now, having taken two
noncollinear translations,

00:25:09.690 --> 00:25:16.100
those translations will imply
a two-dimensional space

00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:32.990
lattice in which motifs will
be hung at translations nT1

00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:40.390
plus mT2 where n, m are integers
that go from minus

00:25:40.390 --> 00:25:42.980
infinity to plus infinity.

00:25:45.660 --> 00:25:48.500
OK, so this is a two-dimensional
space lattice,

00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:52.730
or sometimes it's referred to
by the term a lattice net.

00:25:55.230 --> 00:25:55.625
Good term.

00:25:55.625 --> 00:25:57.485
It looks like what fishermen
throw in the

00:25:57.485 --> 00:25:58.720
water to snag fish.

00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:03.110
So it is a net, in terms of
something that we're familiar

00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:04.640
with in everyday life.

00:26:09.260 --> 00:26:09.500
All right.

00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:13.040
So we've specified a space
lattice, but it is a highly

00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:15.020
redundant pattern.

00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:19.150
We've got a doubly infinite
set of lattice points.

00:26:19.150 --> 00:26:23.750
And the unique nature of the
pattern, the structure, is

00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:26.630
going to be whatever
is associated

00:26:26.630 --> 00:26:29.660
with one lattice point.

00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:33.050
So if we specify what's going
on in the vicinity of one

00:26:33.050 --> 00:26:36.050
lattice point and establish that
at every other lattice

00:26:36.050 --> 00:26:38.010
point, we have the
entire infinite

00:26:38.010 --> 00:26:40.150
two-dimensional structure.

00:26:40.150 --> 00:26:45.600
So let's ask now, how we can
define the area that is unique

00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:46.850
to one lattice point.

00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:51.155
And there are several
ways of doing this.

00:26:54.850 --> 00:27:00.120
We can specify T1, and
then specify T2.

00:27:05.830 --> 00:27:08.580
We'll repeat T1 up to here.

00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:15.980
T1 will repeat to T2 over to
here, and we will have defined

00:27:15.980 --> 00:27:19.330
the area that is uniquely
associated

00:27:19.330 --> 00:27:21.540
with one lattice point.

00:27:21.540 --> 00:27:25.190
So if I can tell you what's
going on within the confines

00:27:25.190 --> 00:27:31.940
of this parallelogram, then I
have given you the unique part

00:27:31.940 --> 00:27:35.470
of what is hung at a lattice
point, and which is reproduced

00:27:35.470 --> 00:27:37.630
only by translation.

00:27:37.630 --> 00:27:40.130
And this is a very important
construct.

00:27:40.130 --> 00:27:46.100
It is something that is referred
to as the unit cell,

00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:48.220
or sometimes just
cell for short.

00:27:53.840 --> 00:28:02.840
And now we encounter a
curious ambiguity.

00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:07.915
T1 and T2 imply an array
of lattice points.

00:28:15.870 --> 00:28:20.480
And this particular choice of
T1 and T2 define a cell.

00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:28.270
But the reverse is not true.

00:28:28.270 --> 00:28:29.695
If I give you--

00:28:36.290 --> 00:28:37.080
and what do I want to say?

00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:43.810
That a particular lattice
does not specify

00:28:43.810 --> 00:28:45.960
a unique unit cell.

00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:49.220
Or, stated another way, there
are many different choices for

00:28:49.220 --> 00:28:56.170
T1 and T2 that would specify
the same unique area.

00:28:56.170 --> 00:29:00.210
I could take this as a T1 prime,
and then I would have a

00:29:00.210 --> 00:29:03.380
cell that looks like this.

00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:06.600
And that would also define the
area associated with one

00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:07.770
lattice point.

00:29:07.770 --> 00:29:11.600
It's not clear this oblique
thing with one very long T1

00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:16.400
prime would have very much to
commend it, but there are many

00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:28.780
ways, many choices, for
T1 and T2, to find

00:29:28.780 --> 00:29:30.150
exactly the same lattice.

00:29:45.260 --> 00:29:48.950
We could take this as T1, this
as T2, same lattice, same

00:29:48.950 --> 00:29:50.010
array of lattice points.

00:29:50.010 --> 00:29:53.060
Take this as T1, this as T2,
same array of lattice points.

00:29:53.060 --> 00:29:57.450
Take this as T1, this as T2,
that's yet another choice.

00:29:57.450 --> 00:30:01.500
So there are an infinite
number of translations.

00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:06.620
Special name for this, to
introduce a bit of jargon

00:30:06.620 --> 00:30:09.550
again, these are very often
called conjugate translations.

00:30:25.060 --> 00:30:27.920
So all this is still nothing
more than simple geometry, but

00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:32.520
if you invent some fancy words,
you really have to do

00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:33.840
that to impress your friends.

00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:35.360
Yeah, you had a question here?

00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:36.340
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:30:36.340 --> 00:30:38.300
So you can define magnitude
for T1 and

00:30:38.300 --> 00:30:39.770
T2, all those constants.

00:30:39.770 --> 00:30:41.975
But you're changing the
directions of T1 and T2, and

00:30:41.975 --> 00:30:43.690
you're saying, even though
you're changing those

00:30:43.690 --> 00:30:45.100
directions, it's still
the same unit cell?

00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:49.580
PROFESSOR: Yeah, provided I have
some new translation like

00:30:49.580 --> 00:30:54.630
this one here, which is really
this T1 plus this T2, this

00:30:54.630 --> 00:30:57.200
would define a very,
very oblique cell

00:30:57.200 --> 00:30:59.140
that looks like this.

00:30:59.140 --> 00:31:04.983
But yet, the terminal points
of T1 prime and--

00:31:04.983 --> 00:31:06.280
I need a term for this.

00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:08.590
I'll call this T2 prime.

00:31:08.590 --> 00:31:11.510
The terminal points here are
going to be exactly the same

00:31:11.510 --> 00:31:14.140
as the nodes that are
defined here.

00:31:14.140 --> 00:31:19.880
So they are two choices for
one in the same lattice.

00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:25.020
OK, so the implication of
this is we're going to

00:31:25.020 --> 00:31:26.270
have to have rules.

00:31:29.950 --> 00:31:34.980
And some of these make
common sense.

00:31:34.980 --> 00:31:38.540
You could pick, in a
two-dimensional lattice, some

00:31:38.540 --> 00:31:44.170
absolutely ridiculous unit cells
defined in terms of very

00:31:44.170 --> 00:31:55.080
long vectors that define a
cell that is a very, very

00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:56.910
oblique cell.

00:31:56.910 --> 00:31:59.590
So it's the lattice
that's defined by

00:31:59.590 --> 00:32:02.230
this translation here.

00:32:02.230 --> 00:32:06.140
And the next translation
parallel to this one would go

00:32:06.140 --> 00:32:08.905
way up to something like this.

00:32:13.540 --> 00:32:14.450
So there's a T1.

00:32:14.450 --> 00:32:15.360
There's a T2.

00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:18.070
This crazy cell here works.

00:32:18.070 --> 00:32:19.850
That's the area that's
associated

00:32:19.850 --> 00:32:20.780
with one lattice point.

00:32:20.780 --> 00:32:23.860
But clearly, it has absolutely
nothing to

00:32:23.860 --> 00:32:25.630
commend this choice.

00:32:25.630 --> 00:32:27.940
There's nothing to be gained
by using these long

00:32:27.940 --> 00:32:30.640
translations that make
very extreme

00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:33.010
intertranslation angles.

00:32:33.010 --> 00:32:35.030
Your intuition would say,
why would you want to

00:32:35.030 --> 00:32:36.290
do that, you dummy?

00:32:36.290 --> 00:32:39.880
Let's take these as the
translations, which is

00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:42.620
something I sort of naturally
did all along.

00:32:42.620 --> 00:32:43.740
And what are we doing?

00:32:43.740 --> 00:32:46.435
We're picking the shortest
translations.

00:32:57.230 --> 00:32:59.330
So there's one very
common sense rule.

00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:07.940
Another rule, getting a little
bit ahead of the game, but

00:33:07.940 --> 00:33:11.700
suppose I examine the lattice
that describes the arrangement

00:33:11.700 --> 00:33:15.400
of four floor tiles.

00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:17.910
If I take a lattice point
right at the point of

00:33:17.910 --> 00:33:23.620
intersection of the joins
between the tiles, that is a

00:33:23.620 --> 00:33:27.310
cell that is exactly square.

00:33:27.310 --> 00:33:30.420
And it's exactly square because
there's a four-fold

00:33:30.420 --> 00:33:35.460
axis in that pattern that leaves
things invariant after

00:33:35.460 --> 00:33:39.070
a 90-degree rotation.

00:33:39.070 --> 00:33:42.310
So if that's the nature of a
lattice, if it in fact is

00:33:42.310 --> 00:33:45.970
constrained because of the
symmetry that is there to have

00:33:45.970 --> 00:33:48.790
two translations identical
in length, in fact,

00:33:48.790 --> 00:33:50.170
identical in every way.

00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:56.270
Pick those as the choice of
the cell to emphasize that

00:33:56.270 --> 00:33:59.380
special key feature
of the lattice.

00:33:59.380 --> 00:34:07.470
So a second row, which is a
second and final one, is to

00:34:07.470 --> 00:34:16.100
pick a T1 and T2 that displays
the symmetry,

00:34:16.100 --> 00:34:31.334
if any, of the lattice.

00:34:35.670 --> 00:34:38.800
Which introduces us to a feature
which we'll elaborate

00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:42.409
much more later on, that the
translational periodicity and

00:34:42.409 --> 00:34:44.110
the symmetry of the
lattice are two

00:34:44.110 --> 00:34:46.159
things that go together.

00:34:46.159 --> 00:34:49.780
That the fact that there is
translational symmetry

00:34:49.780 --> 00:34:53.620
drastically reduces the number
of symmetries that you could

00:34:53.620 --> 00:34:57.410
have, the fact that there are
symmetries possible for

00:34:57.410 --> 00:34:59.800
presence in a lattice restricts
the number of

00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:02.000
different kinds of cells.

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.960
So these are two aspects of
the pattern, the symmetry

00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:08.600
that's in it and its
periodicity.

00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:13.770
OK, but these are the only two
rules that we really need to

00:35:13.770 --> 00:35:15.920
pick what's called the
standard cell.

00:35:22.140 --> 00:35:25.660
Take the shortest translations
that are available to you, and

00:35:25.660 --> 00:35:31.520
pick translations that display
the symmetry that may be

00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:32.770
present in the lattice.

00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:48.670
Any questions or comments?

00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:13.410
Any comments?

00:36:13.410 --> 00:36:21.240
OK, I think I have time for
one last major point of

00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:22.460
discussion.

00:36:22.460 --> 00:36:27.220
And what we are going to embark
on now is a process of

00:36:27.220 --> 00:36:31.170
synthesis, which will occupy
us for a couple of weeks.

00:36:36.966 --> 00:36:43.630
What I'm going to do is start
with a translation.

00:36:43.630 --> 00:36:49.180
And this defines an infinite
string of lattice points.

00:36:49.180 --> 00:36:54.830
Now, I know that in two
dimensions, I have two kinds

00:36:54.830 --> 00:36:58.630
of symmetry operations that are
present, either rotation

00:36:58.630 --> 00:37:00.930
or translation.

00:37:00.930 --> 00:37:04.160
So now, I'm going to ask the
question, what happens if I

00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:07.610
define a lattice, or at least
one translation in a lattice,

00:37:07.610 --> 00:37:14.600
and now I add to that lattice an
operation of rotation, OK?

00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:15.050
I can do that.

00:37:15.050 --> 00:37:18.170
We've seen examples of
translationally periodic

00:37:18.170 --> 00:37:21.390
patterns that have rotational
symmetry.

00:37:21.390 --> 00:37:27.190
So let me suppose I add to
this space a rotation

00:37:27.190 --> 00:37:30.730
operation, A alpha.

00:37:30.730 --> 00:37:34.490
And there's no unique origin
to the translation.

00:37:34.490 --> 00:37:37.330
There is no unique location
for a lattice point.

00:37:37.330 --> 00:37:42.460
So I can put the operation A
alpha in at my designated

00:37:42.460 --> 00:37:45.380
lattice point.

00:37:45.380 --> 00:37:50.440
Now, if I do that, all hell
breaks loose because now I

00:37:50.440 --> 00:37:53.150
have a rotation operation
A alpha.

00:37:53.150 --> 00:37:55.700
This has a translation
coming out of it.

00:37:55.700 --> 00:37:59.270
That translation will be
repeated up here, an angle

00:37:59.270 --> 00:38:00.520
alpha away.

00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:03.160
A alpha acts on everything,
so it's going to take this

00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:09.360
translation and move it over
here to a location for another

00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:10.210
translation.

00:38:10.210 --> 00:38:11.250
This is a lattice point.

00:38:11.250 --> 00:38:12.540
This is a lattice point.

00:38:12.540 --> 00:38:16.340
And this business is going to
go on until it comes around

00:38:16.340 --> 00:38:19.090
full circle.

00:38:19.090 --> 00:38:22.040
Let me focus my attention
on just one of these

00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:26.170
translations, and this will be
this one up here, the one that

00:38:26.170 --> 00:38:28.960
is alpha away from
the first in a

00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:31.190
counterclockwise direction.

00:38:31.190 --> 00:38:35.080
So here sits another
translation, and that means

00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:36.330
this is a lattice point.

00:38:41.220 --> 00:38:43.750
At this end of the translation,
the same thing is

00:38:43.750 --> 00:38:44.760
going to happen.

00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:48.970
The operation A alpha is moved
to this location at the end of

00:38:48.970 --> 00:38:50.100
the translation.

00:38:50.100 --> 00:38:52.520
That means that anything coming
out of this lattice

00:38:52.520 --> 00:38:57.790
point must also be repeated at
angular intervals, alpha.

00:38:57.790 --> 00:39:00.550
And now I'm going to focus
my attention on

00:39:00.550 --> 00:39:02.900
this translation here.

00:39:02.900 --> 00:39:05.960
And there will be a translation
that goes up like

00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:09.140
this, and this is
a lattice point.

00:39:14.390 --> 00:39:17.790
And now, in the words of that
famous musical, there's big

00:39:17.790 --> 00:39:20.960
trouble in River City.

00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:24.150
Because we started out by saying
that everything in the

00:39:24.150 --> 00:39:28.090
space was periodic at an
interval, T, a translational

00:39:28.090 --> 00:39:29.320
interval, T.

00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:33.540
This is T. This is T.
This is T. Here we

00:39:33.540 --> 00:39:35.000
have a lattice point.

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:41.270
This jolly well has to be T as
well, or we've contradicted

00:39:41.270 --> 00:39:44.250
the basic assumption of
our construction.

00:39:44.250 --> 00:39:46.840
Well, that's over restrictive.

00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:53.165
This doesn't have to be T, but
it has to be some multiple, p,

00:39:53.165 --> 00:39:54.600
of that translation.

00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:55.950
p could be 0.

00:39:55.950 --> 00:39:57.180
p could be 5.

00:39:57.180 --> 00:40:00.640
But it has to be an integral
number of translations because

00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:03.620
this translational periodicity
has to work everywhere,

00:40:03.620 --> 00:40:06.620
including up on the top
of this trapezohedron.

00:40:09.610 --> 00:40:12.450
So that's a constraint.

00:40:12.450 --> 00:40:14.080
This angle is alpha.

00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:17.620
We cannot let alpha be arbitrary
because the only way

00:40:17.620 --> 00:40:21.010
we can add a rotation operation
A alpha to a lattice

00:40:21.010 --> 00:40:25.040
is for a value of alpha which
makes this translation be a

00:40:25.040 --> 00:40:28.270
multiple of the original one.

00:40:28.270 --> 00:40:30.990
Now, let me take this geometry,
and I'm going to

00:40:30.990 --> 00:40:33.980
extract the basic constraint
from it.

00:40:33.980 --> 00:40:37.745
This is some integer, p times T.
This is T. This is T. This

00:40:37.745 --> 00:40:39.920
is T. This is alpha.

00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:44.770
Let me lickety split drop down
a perpendicular to the

00:40:44.770 --> 00:40:46.770
original translation.

00:40:46.770 --> 00:40:52.730
This is T times the
cosine of alpha.

00:40:52.730 --> 00:40:56.450
This is T times the
cosine of alpha.

00:40:56.450 --> 00:41:03.490
This total length is T. This
length in here is p times T.

00:41:03.490 --> 00:41:07.060
And now I can go away from the
geometry to an equation,

00:41:07.060 --> 00:41:09.650
something you probably
prefer to deal with.

00:41:09.650 --> 00:41:14.490
And what this constraint is
expressed analytically is that

00:41:14.490 --> 00:41:26.690
my original translation, T,
minus twice T times the cosine

00:41:26.690 --> 00:41:36.090
of alpha has to come out equal
to an integer, p times T. And

00:41:36.090 --> 00:41:39.390
there's my constraint.

00:41:39.390 --> 00:41:41.980
Alpha has to satisfy
that condition.

00:41:41.980 --> 00:41:46.330
Well, I can immediately cancel
the T and write this as one

00:41:46.330 --> 00:41:52.331
minus 2 cosine of alpha is
equal to an integer, p.

00:41:52.331 --> 00:41:55.470
And it figures that that has to
be the case because none of

00:41:55.470 --> 00:41:58.350
this construction depends on
the size of the original

00:41:58.350 --> 00:42:00.070
translation that I took.

00:42:00.070 --> 00:42:03.980
And now, let me solve for the
values of alpha which are

00:42:03.980 --> 00:42:06.360
compatible with a lattice.

00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:11.270
This says that cosine of alpha
is 1 minus p over 2.

00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:19.290
And unless that condition
holds, my combination is

00:42:19.290 --> 00:42:20.540
incompatible.

00:42:24.880 --> 00:42:29.060
So I'm going to let that stew
with you until next time.

00:42:29.060 --> 00:42:33.480
But what we've set up is
something where we can just

00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:37.280
plug and chug, put in different
values of p.

00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:43.380
And if I start out with a value
of p, and let's let p be

00:42:43.380 --> 00:42:52.620
equal to 4, and then find one
minus p over 2, which is

00:42:52.620 --> 00:42:55.790
supposedly the cosine
of an angle, alpha.

00:42:55.790 --> 00:42:59.230
If that's 4, I will
have minus 3/2.

00:42:59.230 --> 00:43:02.550
And the value of alpha obviously
does not exist.

00:43:02.550 --> 00:43:06.560
Cosine of alpha cannot
get greater than 1.

00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:15.210
If p is equal to 3, then 1 minus
3 over 2 is minus 2 over

00:43:15.210 --> 00:43:17.850
2, or minus 1.

00:43:17.850 --> 00:43:19.720
You like the way I do that
arithmetic in my

00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:22.370
head just like that?

00:43:22.370 --> 00:43:30.030
And the angle whose cosine is
minus 1 is 180 degrees.

00:43:30.030 --> 00:43:33.930
And what that says is that
a two-fold axis works.

00:43:40.290 --> 00:43:44.580
So I can drop a two-fold
axis into a net.

00:43:44.580 --> 00:43:47.920
And what that's going to do is
take my original translation,

00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:53.710
rotate it 180 degrees, and
the second translation is

00:43:53.710 --> 00:43:54.960
going to sit here.

00:43:57.260 --> 00:44:01.250
Rotate it 180 degrees in the
reverse direction, and then

00:44:01.250 --> 00:44:03.930
the second lattice
point sits here.

00:44:03.930 --> 00:44:07.360
And lo and behold, just as
advertised, the distance

00:44:07.360 --> 00:44:10.500
between the first lattice point
and the final lattice

00:44:10.500 --> 00:44:11.750
point is three translations.

00:44:14.570 --> 00:44:18.740
So I can put a two-fold axis
in any lattice whatsoever

00:44:18.740 --> 00:44:23.730
because this is compatible
simply with a lattice row.

00:44:23.730 --> 00:44:27.520
So one possible combination of
rotation in a lattice is going

00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:33.140
to be any lattice whatsoever,
and what we can add to this is

00:44:33.140 --> 00:44:35.020
a rotation operation A pi.

00:44:41.140 --> 00:44:44.630
And we'll have two full rotation
operations which are

00:44:44.630 --> 00:44:46.600
translationally equivalent.

00:44:49.312 --> 00:44:49.770
All right.

00:44:49.770 --> 00:44:50.970
Several integers to go.

00:44:50.970 --> 00:44:53.230
We would want to
try p equals 2.

00:44:53.230 --> 00:44:54.450
That's going to work.

00:44:54.450 --> 00:44:56.900
p equals plus 1 is
going to work.

00:44:56.900 --> 00:44:59.500
p equals 0 is going to work.

00:44:59.500 --> 00:45:03.700
And we will find a very limited
number of rotational

00:45:03.700 --> 00:45:07.560
operations that are compatible
with a lattice.

00:45:07.560 --> 00:45:12.580
And this is going to give us a
small number of the possible

00:45:12.580 --> 00:45:16.660
combinations of lattice and
rotational symmetry in two

00:45:16.660 --> 00:45:17.910
dimensions.

00:45:19.950 --> 00:45:22.010
So we'll pick up from there
next time, and we'll very

00:45:22.010 --> 00:45:26.750
quickly determine the remaining
possibilities and

00:45:26.750 --> 00:45:29.400
take a look at what the
arrangement of symmetry

00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:30.925
elements look like in
these lattices.

00:45:36.510 --> 00:45:39.620
OK, once again, I have some
extra copies of the syllabus

00:45:39.620 --> 00:45:42.240
if somebody did not get one.

00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:45.910
And I'll have extra copies
of the problem set.

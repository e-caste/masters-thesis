00:00:16.401 --> 00:00:19.270
ADAM MARTIN: Well, first of
all, nice job on the exam.

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:22.440
We were quite pleased
with how you guys did.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.630
And so from now
on in the course,

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.910
Professor Imperiali
has been telling you

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.759
about information flow, but
information flow within itself,

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.770
so information flow from
the DNA to the proteins that

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:43.530
are made in the cell, which
determines what that cell does.

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.450
And so we're going to
switch directions today.

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:49.080
And we're going to start
talking about how information

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.680
flows between cells--

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.740
so from a parent cell
to its daughter cells.

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:59.160
And we're also going to talk
about how information flows

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.280
from generation to the next.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.810
And this, of course, is
the study of genetics.

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.360
And what genetics is
as a discipline is it

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:22.380
is the study of genes
and their inheritance.

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.570
And the genes that you
inherit influences what

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.340
is known as your phenotype.

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.550
And what phenotype
is is simply the set

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:47.490
of traits that define you.

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.455
So you can think of it as
a set of observable traits.

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.480
And this involves your
genes, as you probably know.

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.900
I mean, just this morning, I was
dropping my son off at school,

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.770
and he was comparing how tall he
was compared to his classmates.

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.880
And as he went in, he was like,
thanks for the genes, dad.

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.180
So I expect that
many of you are going

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.000
to be familiar with much
of what we'll discuss,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.640
but we're going to lay
a real solid foundation,

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.150
because it's really
fundamental for understanding

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:32.760
the rules of inheritance
and how that works.

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.890
So genetics is the
study of genes.

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.040
So what is a gene?

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.640
You can think about
genes in different ways.

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.370
And what we've been
talking about up until now,

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.120
we've been talking about
molecular biology and what

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.925
is known as the central dogma.

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:03.840
And the central dogma states
that the source of the code

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.550
is in the DNA.

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:09.540
And there's an information
flow from a piece of DNA,

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.110
which is a gene.

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.050
And the gene is a
piece of DNA that

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:17.790
then encodes some sort of
RNA, such as a messenger RNA.

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.930
And many of these RNAs
can make specific proteins

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.190
that do things in your
cells in your body.

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.820
So that's one very
molecular picture of a gene.

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:35.130
You can think of a gene as
a string of nucleotides.

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:39.540
And there might be a reading
frame in those nucleotides that

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.450
encodes a protein.

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.900
So that's a very molecular
picture of a gene.

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:51.180
The field of genetics started
well before we knew about DNA,

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.950
and its importance, and
what the DNA encoded

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:57.960
RNA which encoded proteins.

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:01.590
So the concept of a gene
is much older than that.

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.130
And so another way you
can think of a gene

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:08.190
is it's essentially the
functional unit of heredity.

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:16.170
So it's the functional
unit of heredity.

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:23.400
I'll bump this up.

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:33.850
So I want to just briefly
pause and kind of give you

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:38.020
an overview of why I think
genetics is so important.

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.200
So what you saw up here
is you saw a cell divide.

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.600
And I showed you this
in the last lecture--

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.780
you saw the chromosomes,
which are here,

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:48.850
how they're segregated
to different daughters.

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:52.180
And this is-- basically, you're
seeing the information flow

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:55.600
from the parent cell into
the daughter herself.

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.600
But we saw this, so I'm
just going to skip ahead.

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:02.020
So why is this so important?

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:05.050
I'm going to give you a
fairly grandiose view of why

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:07.390
genetics is so important.

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:11.020
And I'm going to say that
we can make a good argument

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:15.430
that genetics is
responsible for the rise

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:16.810
of modern civilization.

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:26.410
Humans, as a species, began
manipulating genes and genetics

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:29.440
even before we had any
understanding of what

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:30.230
was going on.

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:33.400
So this is more of an
unconscious selection.

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:38.560
And so 10,000 years ago,
humans were hunter gatherers.

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:41.830
They'd go out, and try to
find nuts and seeds, and hunt

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:42.370
animals.

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:44.410
And that's how we got our food.

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:48.190
But around 10,000 years
ago was the first example

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:51.370
of where humans, as
a species, really

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:55.960
altered the phenotype of
a plant, in this case.

00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:00.740
So wild wheat and wild barley,
the seeds develop in a pod.

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:02.740
And the biology
of the wild wheat

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:05.650
is such that the pod
shatters, and the seeds then

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:08.230
spread on the ground
where they can then

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:10.630
germinate into new plants.

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:14.410
But 10,000 years
ago, humans decided

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:18.880
that it would be more ideal if
we had a form of wheat which

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:22.300
didn't shatter, which is
known as non-shattering wheat

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:26.260
in which the seeds
remain on the plant.

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.930
And that allows it to
be easily harvested

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:30.970
at the end of the season.

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:34.420
So 10,000 years ago is
one of the first examples

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:37.930
where humans really
genetically altered

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:39.430
the phenotype of a plant.

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:42.490
And they selected for
this non-shattering wheat,

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:46.870
which then allowed for
the rise of agriculture.

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:51.480
In addition to wheat, we also--

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:54.790
about 4,000 years
ago was the rise

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:57.620
of domesticated fruit and nuts.

00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:58.900
So here are some almonds.

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:02.350
If you would like an almond,
feel free to have some.

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:03.500
You guys want some almonds?

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:04.000
No.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.750
If you have a nut
allergy, don't eat them.

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:10.060
Great.

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:14.400
So wild almonds,
when you chew them,

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:16.120
there's an enzymatic
reaction that

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:19.840
results in cyanide forming.

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:22.810
Rachel just stopped chewing.

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:23.450
Don't worry.

00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:27.760
These are almonds that are
harvested at Trader Joe's, so

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:29.440
you're safe.

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:32.920
And so the wild
almonds, obviously,

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:36.130
were not compatible
for consumption.

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:39.040
But 4,000 years
ago, humans again

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:41.710
selected for a form
of the almond, which

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:44.980
involved just a single
gene, which was non-bitter

00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:50.290
and known as a sweet almond,
which was also not toxic.

00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:54.760
So this doesn't just go for
foods, but also for clothing.

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:58.600
So humans have selected
for cotton with long lint.

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:03.100
And that served as a basis
for clothing and sort

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:06.010
of allowing us to have fabric.

00:08:06.010 --> 00:08:09.670
And I just want to end with a
little story about the almond,

00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:12.550
which is part of the
archaeological evidence

00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:15.100
for when almonds
were domesticated

00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:18.280
was when King Tut's
tomb was unearthed.

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:20.800
And they found a pile of
almonds next to the tomb,

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:24.520
because the Egyptian
culture, what they did

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:28.180
is they buried the dead
with food to sustain them

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:30.160
in the afterlife.

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:32.559
So that just gives you
an idea as to how far

00:08:32.559 --> 00:08:36.280
back the importance
of genetics goes.

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:38.710
If we think about
nowadays, right now

00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:43.090
you are always seeing
genetics in the news.

00:08:43.090 --> 00:08:45.670
And you also have
the opportunity

00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:50.530
yourself to sort of do your
own genetic experiment.

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:53.830
And so now you guys
are undoubtedly

00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:56.140
aware of all these
companies that

00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:58.042
want you to send them your DNA.

00:08:58.042 --> 00:08:59.500
And they also want
you to send them

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:03.160
money, such that they
can give you information

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:10.270
about your family tree and also
information about your health.

00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:13.130
So this is now a big business.

00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:15.340
But if you don't
understand genetics,

00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:20.000
this is not as useful
as it could be.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.370
So I'm just curious.

00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:24.220
How many people here have
used one of these services

00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:26.960
and had their DNA genotyped?

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:27.950
Cool.

00:09:27.950 --> 00:09:30.390
And do you think
that really changed

00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:32.640
your view of who you are?

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:34.360
Or was it kind of, eh?

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:36.390
AUDIENCE: We actually--
I don't know if we even

00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:37.598
looked at where we came from.

00:09:37.598 --> 00:09:39.792
We looked for genetic disease.

00:09:39.792 --> 00:09:42.000
ADAM MARTIN: So you're
looking for genetic disorders.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.350
And you don't have to tell
me anything about that.

00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:50.830
Yeah, so I have not done
this, but my dad has done it.

00:09:50.830 --> 00:09:53.970
And he will go
find his relatives

00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:55.770
and bore them with our ancestry.

00:09:59.190 --> 00:10:01.980
So this is one example
of how genetics is really

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:03.720
in play today.

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:05.400
And not everyone
knows how this works.

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:08.550
I've had people at Starbucks
in the morning come up

00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:14.130
to me with their 23andMe profile
and ask me to explain stuff,

00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:16.330
because they know who I am.

00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:19.200
It's a little awkward.

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:22.350
So we can also use
genetics for forensics.

00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:25.230
And so this is kind of a--

00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:28.500
I had a lab manager in
the lab, and he told me

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:32.370
that people were doing
this in senior homes

00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:35.130
in Florida, which I
thought was kind of funny.

00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:40.470
What I find hilarious about
this is the mug shot of the dog.

00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:42.840
That dog looks so guilty.

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:45.540
But you can use DNA to--

00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:48.680
you can use DNA
to genotype poop.

00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:50.580
You can genotype
your neighbor's dog.

00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:53.280
You can get evidence that
they're the one that's

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:55.530
pooping on your lawn.

00:10:55.530 --> 00:10:57.930
So that's a
not-so-serious example.

00:10:57.930 --> 00:11:01.740
But there are more
serious examples

00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:05.310
of where DNA genotyping
is really having

00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:07.200
an effect in our society.

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:10.350
And this is something I
mentioned in the intro lecture.

00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:14.580
Just this past
spring, someone was

00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:18.360
suspected as being the
Golden State Killer.

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:19.710
This is a cold case.

00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:23.360
The killings happened
40 years ago,

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:28.200
but the break came from
investigators getting DNA

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:31.740
from the suspect's
relatives to implicate

00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:34.380
this person in this crime.

00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:36.480
So they had DNA from the crime.

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:39.510
And they saw that there were
matches to the DNA at the crime

00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:40.530
to certain people.

00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:42.870
And then they can
reconstruct who

00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:47.400
might be the person in the
right place to commit the crime.

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:48.420
So this is--

00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:50.340
I think this is
interesting, because it also

00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:54.060
leads to all sorts of
privacy issues, right?

00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:59.460
Who's going to gain
access to your genotype

00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:02.460
if you submitted to
these companies, right?

00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:04.490
I mean, this is
probably a case where

00:12:04.490 --> 00:12:08.370
I'd argue there's probably a
beneficial result in that you

00:12:08.370 --> 00:12:12.150
can actually figure out if
someone's committed a crime.

00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:13.800
But there are other
issues in terms

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:15.990
of thinking about
insurance companies

00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:22.800
where we might be interested
in having our information not

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:25.380
publicly available to
insurance companies.

00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:28.020
And maybe this is something
we can discuss later

00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:31.580
on in another lecture.

00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:34.260
For today, I want to move
on and go through really

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:36.690
the fundamentals of genetics.

00:12:36.690 --> 00:12:39.720
And what I'm going to do is I'm
going to start with the answer.

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:40.410
OK?

00:12:40.410 --> 00:12:42.780
I'm going to present
to you guys today

00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:46.710
the physical model for
how inheritance happens.

00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:47.700
OK?

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:54.750
So today, we're going to
go over the physical model

00:12:54.750 --> 00:12:55.860
of inheritance.

00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:05.920
And this physical model
involves cell division,

00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:07.950
which you saw in
the last lecture

00:13:07.950 --> 00:13:11.340
and also in my opening slide.

00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:15.060
It involves cell division
and the physical segregation

00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:18.190
of the chromosomes
during cell division.

00:13:18.190 --> 00:13:20.160
So also chromosome segregation.

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:34.770
OK, so this is how I'm going
to represent chromosomes.

00:13:34.770 --> 00:13:40.330
And I just want to step you
through what it all means.

00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:44.460
So I have these two
arms that are attached

00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:46.320
to this central circle.

00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:50.490
The circle is meant to
represent the centromere.

00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:53.640
So this is the centromere.

00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:56.700
And you'll remember from
the last lecture on Monday,

00:13:56.700 --> 00:14:00.150
the centromere is the
piece of the chromosome

00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:03.930
that physically is attached
to the microtubules that

00:14:03.930 --> 00:14:06.720
are going to pull the
chromosomes to separate poles.

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:09.300
OK?

00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:11.430
So that's called the centromere.

00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:13.830
And usually, it's denoted,
it's like a constriction

00:14:13.830 --> 00:14:15.940
in the chromosome
or a little circle.

00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:16.710
OK?

00:14:16.710 --> 00:14:20.820
These other parts of the
chromosome are the chromosome.

00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:23.250
So that you have the
arms of the chromosome.

00:14:23.250 --> 00:14:26.310
Now I'm drawing what's known
as a metacentric chromosome.

00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:28.118
It's not important that
you know that term.

00:14:28.118 --> 00:14:29.660
But it just means
that the centromere

00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:31.577
is in the middle
of the chromosome.

00:14:31.577 --> 00:14:33.910
There are other types of
chromosomes with the centromere

00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:34.950
might be at the end.

00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:36.240
OK?

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:39.370
So there are different
types of chromosomes.

00:14:39.370 --> 00:14:42.270
All right, now,
for all of us, we

00:14:42.270 --> 00:14:46.770
have cells that have different
numbers of chromosomes.

00:14:46.770 --> 00:14:47.820
OK?

00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:51.180
Some of our cells are
what is known as haploid.

00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:56.520
And what I mean by
haploid is there

00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:58.560
is a single set of chromosomes.

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:09.690
Now the cells that we have that
are haploid are our gametes,

00:15:09.690 --> 00:15:11.770
so they're our eggs
and our sperm cells.

00:15:11.770 --> 00:15:12.630
OK?

00:15:12.630 --> 00:15:14.010
So these include gametes.

00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:22.387
OK, but most of the
cells in your body

00:15:22.387 --> 00:15:23.595
are what is known as diploid.

00:15:30.270 --> 00:15:33.840
And diploid means there's two
complete sets of chromosomes.

00:15:45.450 --> 00:15:47.910
OK, and you get one
set from one parent,

00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:50.380
the other set from
the other parent.

00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:50.880
OK?

00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:52.560
So one set from each parent.

00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:05.490
OK, and I'll draw the
other set like this.

00:16:05.490 --> 00:16:10.050
And what I'll do is I'll
just shade in this one

00:16:10.050 --> 00:16:11.910
to denote that it's different.

00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:13.080
OK?

00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:16.440
So these two
chromosomes then are

00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:18.910
what is known as homologous.

00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:22.060
They're homologous chromosomes.

00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:22.752
Homologous.

00:16:26.790 --> 00:16:36.280
OK, and what I mean by
them being homologous

00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:39.100
is that, basically,
these two chromosomes

00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:42.100
have the same set of genes.

00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:43.645
OK, so they have the same genes.

00:16:48.750 --> 00:16:50.420
They have the same genes.

00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:53.590
But they have different
variants of those genes.

00:16:53.590 --> 00:17:03.250
OK, so different
variants of these genes.

00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:06.760
And these variants are
referred to as alleles.

00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:09.220
OK?

00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:12.310
So if you have the same gene
but they differ slightly

00:17:12.310 --> 00:17:16.280
in their nucleic
acid sequence, then

00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:18.790
they're distinct
alleles of those genes.

00:17:21.530 --> 00:17:24.880
So often, the way
geneticists refer

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:27.400
to these different
variants or alleles

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:31.300
is we use a capital letter
and a lower case letter.

00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:34.900
OK, so this chromosome
over here might have

00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:38.190
a gene that's allele capital a.

00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:41.280
And then this
homologous chromosome

00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:44.020
will have the same gene but
a different allele, which

00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:46.820
I'll denote lowercase a.

00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:47.590
OK?

00:17:47.590 --> 00:17:51.205
So in this case,
big A and little a

00:17:51.205 --> 00:17:54.220
are different alleles
of the same gene.

00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:57.940
They might produce a
slightly different protein,

00:17:57.940 --> 00:18:01.420
which would result possibly
in a different phenotype.

00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:02.710
OK?

00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:05.060
So everyone understand
that distinction?

00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:07.300
Oh, I want to make one
point because this came up

00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:10.240
last semester and was
one of those cases

00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:12.970
where I forgot the
part about the head.

00:18:12.970 --> 00:18:18.280
So we often just have two
alleles when we teach genetics.

00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:21.280
But I hope you can see
that because a gene is

00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:26.080
a long sequence of DNA, there
is a ton of different alleles

00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:27.880
you can have within
a given gene.

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:30.520
So one nucleotide
difference in that gene

00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:32.290
would result in a
different allele.

00:18:32.290 --> 00:18:33.070
OK?

00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:34.960
So we often refer
to two alleles,

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:38.140
but there can be more than
two alleles for a given gene.

00:18:38.140 --> 00:18:39.400
OK?

00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:43.570
Does everyone see how
that manifests itself?

00:18:43.570 --> 00:18:44.140
OK, great.

00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:46.870
Any questions up until now?

00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:48.000
Yes, Carmen?

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.470
AUDIENCE: So when you say
that there's more than one,

00:18:50.470 --> 00:18:54.310
more than just the two alleles,
I don't have more than one

00:18:54.310 --> 00:18:55.270
on each chromosome.

00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:57.670
So they're just more than one--

00:18:57.670 --> 00:18:59.300
ADAM MARTIN: In the population.

00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:02.740
So Carmen asked,
well, can I have

00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:05.050
like five alleles of a gene?

00:19:05.050 --> 00:19:06.820
And that's a great question.

00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:10.630
And so thank you,
Carmen, for asking that.

00:19:10.630 --> 00:19:14.650
What I mean is if we consider
a population as a whole, right?

00:19:14.650 --> 00:19:17.140
You have two alleles
of each gene,

00:19:17.140 --> 00:19:20.350
unless it's a gene that
somehow duplicated.

00:19:20.350 --> 00:19:23.590
And so when we're
considering the population,

00:19:23.590 --> 00:19:25.300
there can be more than-- right?

00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:28.750
I mean, I see we
have people with--

00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:30.813
hair color is not
a monogenic trait.

00:19:30.813 --> 00:19:32.980
But we have people with
black hair, with blond hair,

00:19:32.980 --> 00:19:34.480
with brown hair, right?

00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:39.100
There is more than just
two possible alleles

00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:40.490
with possible phenotypes.

00:19:40.490 --> 00:19:40.990
OK?

00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:46.910
All right, let's
go up with this.

00:19:46.910 --> 00:19:48.910
All right, now I want to
start at the beginning.

00:19:52.150 --> 00:19:55.780
So most of our
cells are diploid.

00:19:55.780 --> 00:20:00.310
And the origin of our
first diploid cell

00:20:00.310 --> 00:20:03.360
is from the union
of two gametes.

00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:05.200
OK?

00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:07.360
So I'm going to draw
two gametes here.

00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:08.320
Each is one n.

00:20:11.530 --> 00:20:15.160
And I'm just going to draw one
set of chromosomes for this

00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:16.240
here.

00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:21.745
So we might have a male
gamete and a female gamete.

00:20:27.130 --> 00:20:32.950
And what I'm referring
to when I say n here,

00:20:32.950 --> 00:20:43.150
n is basically referring to
the number of chromosomes

00:20:43.150 --> 00:20:44.320
per haploid genome.

00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:56.440
So when you have one
n, it means you're

00:20:56.440 --> 00:21:00.155
haploid because you have only
one set of haploid genome.

00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:08.080
But early in your life,
we're all the result

00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:11.540
of a fusion between a
male and female gamete.

00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:14.650
And so that creates
a diploid cell.

00:21:14.650 --> 00:21:21.100
OK, so now, this
diploid zygote, so this

00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:25.840
is referred to as the
zygote, is diploid

00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:29.770
and now has a set of
homologous chromosomes.

00:21:29.770 --> 00:21:30.400
OK?

00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:33.670
So I'm only drawing one set of
homologous chromosomes here.

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:39.070
So on the board, I'm going
to stick to just one,

00:21:39.070 --> 00:21:41.170
so I don't have to
draw them all out.

00:21:41.170 --> 00:21:43.120
In the slides, I have three.

00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:44.770
OK?

00:21:44.770 --> 00:21:48.260
So each of these
represents a chromosome.

00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:50.230
These are different chromosomes.

00:21:50.230 --> 00:21:52.690
Different chromosomes are
either different color

00:21:52.690 --> 00:21:56.890
or have a different
centromere position.

00:21:56.890 --> 00:21:59.770
And then these down
here that are colored

00:21:59.770 --> 00:22:01.930
are going to be the
homologous chromosomes.

00:22:01.930 --> 00:22:02.590
OK?

00:22:02.590 --> 00:22:04.150
Do you see how I'm
representing this?

00:22:06.830 --> 00:22:12.030
OK, so once you have
the zygote, right,

00:22:12.030 --> 00:22:16.440
so you guys are no
longer one cell, right?

00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:19.780
You guys each are tens
of trillions of cells.

00:22:19.780 --> 00:22:25.620
So this zygote cell had
to reproduce itself,

00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:27.930
and your cells had to
divide, so that you

00:22:27.930 --> 00:22:30.645
grew into an entire
multicellular organism.

00:22:34.220 --> 00:22:36.082
I'll just quickly erase that.

00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:43.020
OK, so when most of your cells
divide, and most of your cells

00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:44.640
are known as somatic cells.

00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:54.240
When cells of your body or
your intestine and your skin,

00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:57.330
when they divide, they
genetically replicate

00:22:57.330 --> 00:22:58.560
themselves.

00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:01.905
And they're undergoing a type of
cell division known as mitosis.

00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:06.090
OK?

00:23:06.090 --> 00:23:15.330
In mitosis, it's essentially
a cloning of a cell.

00:23:15.330 --> 00:23:18.670
Or ideally, it's the
cloning of a cell.

00:23:18.670 --> 00:23:21.150
So you have a diploid cell.

00:23:21.150 --> 00:23:23.460
It has to undergo
DNA replication .

00:23:29.980 --> 00:23:34.390
And when a chromosome
undergoes DNA replication,

00:23:34.390 --> 00:23:38.090
it will, during
mitosis look like this.

00:23:38.090 --> 00:23:39.250
OK?

00:23:39.250 --> 00:23:44.560
And these two different
arms or strands, they're

00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:46.060
known as sister chromatids.

00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:46.560
OK?

00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:49.450
So that's just another
term you should know.

00:23:49.450 --> 00:23:50.860
These are sister chromatids.

00:23:53.650 --> 00:23:59.260
OK, and the sister chromatids,
if DNA replication happens

00:23:59.260 --> 00:24:03.310
without any errors,
should be exactly the same

00:24:03.310 --> 00:24:05.790
as each other in terms
of nucleotide sequence.

00:24:05.790 --> 00:24:06.290
OK?

00:24:09.010 --> 00:24:11.930
So after DNA
replication, this cell

00:24:11.930 --> 00:24:15.600
will essentially have four
times the amount of DNA

00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:21.430
as a haploid cell.

00:24:21.430 --> 00:24:24.800
And it will split
into two cells.

00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:26.410
And again, they'll
both be diploid.

00:24:26.410 --> 00:24:26.910
OK?

00:24:29.605 --> 00:24:30.980
And I'll just
point out, if we're

00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:34.240
thinking about our pair
of chromosomes here,

00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:40.130
right, this parent
cell has both homologs.

00:24:40.130 --> 00:24:42.140
And the daughter
cells, because they

00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:45.000
should be genetically identical,
also have both homologs.

00:24:50.390 --> 00:24:53.570
OK, so that's an example
with just one chromosome.

00:24:53.570 --> 00:24:58.760
I'll take you through an example
with these three chromosomes

00:24:58.760 --> 00:24:59.530
here--

00:24:59.530 --> 00:25:01.700
all six chromosomes.

00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:03.950
So you have--
these are homologs.

00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:05.030
These are homologs.

00:25:05.030 --> 00:25:06.620
These are homologs.

00:25:06.620 --> 00:25:12.760
And during mitosis, all
of these chromosomes

00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:15.760
initially are all
over the nucleus.

00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:19.060
But during mitosis,
they will align along

00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:20.980
the equator of the
cell and what is

00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:23.150
known as the metaphase plate.

00:25:23.150 --> 00:25:27.720
Metaphase is just a fancy
term for one particular stage

00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:30.820
in the mitotic cycle.

00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:33.670
And then what will
happen is the spindle

00:25:33.670 --> 00:25:38.410
will attach to either one
side or the other side

00:25:38.410 --> 00:25:40.240
of these chromosomes.

00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:45.430
And it will physically segregate
them into different cells, OK?

00:25:45.430 --> 00:25:50.260
And what I hope you see here is
that this has six chromosomes.

00:25:50.260 --> 00:25:52.090
This has six chromosomes.

00:25:52.090 --> 00:25:54.400
And these two daughter
cells are genetically

00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:57.850
identical to the parent cell.

00:25:57.850 --> 00:26:01.090
OK, so this is known as
an equational division,

00:26:01.090 --> 00:26:04.630
because it's totally equal.

00:26:04.630 --> 00:26:05.500
OK?

00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:10.220
And again, the daughter
cells are both diploid, OK?

00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:12.050
So that's mitosis.

00:26:12.050 --> 00:26:13.325
Any questions about mitosis?

00:26:16.610 --> 00:26:17.330
OK.

00:26:17.330 --> 00:26:22.630
Moving on, we're going to talk
now about another type of cell.

00:26:22.630 --> 00:26:23.975
And these are your germ cells.

00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:29.840
And these germ cells
undergo an alternative form

00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:33.860
of cell division
known as meiosis, OK?

00:26:33.860 --> 00:26:36.080
And your germ cells--

00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:38.810
germ cells produce
your egg and sperm.

00:26:38.810 --> 00:26:45.440
And so meiosis essentially is
producing gametes, such as egg

00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:47.292
and sperm cells, OK?

00:26:53.070 --> 00:26:57.580
So what's the final
product going to be?

00:26:57.580 --> 00:27:00.695
What should be the genomic
content of the final product

00:27:00.695 --> 00:27:01.195
of meiosis?

00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:06.450
It should be one end, right?

00:27:06.450 --> 00:27:07.140
Who said that?

00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:08.607
Sorry.

00:27:08.607 --> 00:27:09.440
Yeah, exactly right.

00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:10.295
What's your name?

00:27:10.295 --> 00:27:10.670
AUDIENCE: Jeremy.

00:27:10.670 --> 00:27:11.150
ADAM MARTIN: Jeremy.

00:27:11.150 --> 00:27:12.620
So Jeremy is exactly right.

00:27:12.620 --> 00:27:13.400
Right?

00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:17.180
The germ cells-- in order
to reproduce sexually,

00:27:17.180 --> 00:27:19.550
they should be haploid
cells, so that they

00:27:19.550 --> 00:27:24.320
can combine with another haploid
to give rise to a diploid, OK?

00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:28.220
So the ultimate
result that we want

00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:31.190
is to have cells
that are one end.

00:27:31.190 --> 00:27:34.400
But most of our cells
to start out with

00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:37.520
are diploid, so
they're two end, OK?

00:27:41.660 --> 00:27:44.750
So what's special about
meiosis is you're not just

00:27:44.750 --> 00:27:47.090
going from two end to
two end, but you're

00:27:47.090 --> 00:27:49.610
reducing the genetic
content of the cells.

00:27:49.610 --> 00:27:55.610
You're going from two end
to a one end content, OK?

00:27:55.610 --> 00:27:58.580
So again, meiosis starts
with DNA replication.

00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:12.310
But in this case, the first
division, which is meiosis I,

00:28:12.310 --> 00:28:13.900
is not equal.

00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:17.200
And it actually segregates
the homologs, such

00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:23.290
that you get one cell that has
one of the homologs duplicated

00:28:23.290 --> 00:28:26.270
and another cell that has
the other homolog duplicated.

00:28:31.210 --> 00:28:33.690
OK?

00:28:33.690 --> 00:28:34.960
And I'll show this.

00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:35.980
I'll show it right now.

00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:42.340
So this is the same cell now.

00:28:42.340 --> 00:28:45.160
It's undergone DNA replication.

00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:47.695
As you can see, each
chromosome has two copies.

00:28:50.260 --> 00:28:52.690
But instead of all the
chromosomes lining up

00:28:52.690 --> 00:28:55.750
in the same position of the
metaphase plate, what you see

00:28:55.750 --> 00:29:00.850
is that homologous chromosomes
pair at the metaphase plate.

00:29:00.850 --> 00:29:05.620
And what happens here is that
the homologous chromosomes are

00:29:05.620 --> 00:29:06.850
separated--

00:29:06.850 --> 00:29:08.350
two different cells.

00:29:08.350 --> 00:29:13.150
And now, you have two cells that
are not genetically identical,

00:29:13.150 --> 00:29:14.500
OK?

00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:18.370
So because there
is not equational

00:29:18.370 --> 00:29:20.890
and there's a reduction in
the genetic material that's

00:29:20.890 --> 00:29:22.810
present in the
cells, this is known

00:29:22.810 --> 00:29:25.930
as a reductional division, OK?

00:29:25.930 --> 00:29:30.720
So that's meiosis I. And
that's a reductional division.

00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:33.040
And then-- but this
is not yet haploid.

00:29:35.620 --> 00:29:40.960
And so-- here, I'll just
stick another one in here.

00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:44.890
These cells then undergo
another round of division,

00:29:44.890 --> 00:29:46.600
which is known as meiosis II.

00:29:50.650 --> 00:29:54.400
And during this meiosis,
these sister chromatids

00:29:54.400 --> 00:30:00.580
are separated, such that you're
left with one chromosome.

00:30:03.890 --> 00:30:09.240
And my drawing-- at least one
chromosome per gamete, OK?

00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:10.890
So each of these, then, is 1n.

00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:19.020
OK?

00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:22.240
So again, you have
the chromosomes.

00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:26.400
But this time, you have them
aligned like in mitosis.

00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:28.140
They align.

00:30:28.140 --> 00:30:30.750
The sister chromatids
are physically separated.

00:30:30.750 --> 00:30:33.630
And now, you see this
cell is genetically

00:30:33.630 --> 00:30:35.910
identical to this cell.

00:30:35.910 --> 00:30:38.190
And this cell here
is genetically

00:30:38.190 --> 00:30:39.930
identical to this cell, OK?

00:30:39.930 --> 00:30:41.940
So that's meiosis II.

00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:43.530
And that's an
equational division

00:30:43.530 --> 00:30:46.320
much more like mitosis, OK?

00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:50.160
Because the product of the
division of those two cells--

00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:53.250
each of those is equal, OK?

00:30:53.250 --> 00:30:56.190
And finally, the
result of meiosis II

00:30:56.190 --> 00:30:59.910
is that you're then
left with gametes

00:30:59.910 --> 00:31:02.950
that have a haploid
content of their genome.

00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:10.290
OK, I want to end lecture
by doing a demonstration.

00:31:10.290 --> 00:31:12.090
Let's see.

00:31:12.090 --> 00:31:14.880
So this could either
be amazing, or it

00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:17.650
will be a complete disaster.

00:31:17.650 --> 00:31:19.180
So we're totally going to do it.

00:31:19.180 --> 00:31:20.490
So everyone come up.

00:31:33.504 --> 00:31:34.310
Right here.

00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:41.340
Here.

00:31:46.170 --> 00:31:49.510
Evelyn, you can leave
when you have to go.

00:31:49.510 --> 00:31:54.205
And we'll have a
chromosome loss event.

00:31:54.205 --> 00:31:55.040
OK?

00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:56.940
It has to be a multiple of four.

00:31:56.940 --> 00:32:07.765
If we have extra people label,
then the people can supervise.

00:32:07.765 --> 00:32:10.610
Go.

00:32:10.610 --> 00:32:11.280
Oops, sorry.

00:32:17.870 --> 00:32:18.460
All right.

00:32:18.460 --> 00:32:19.970
What do we got here?

00:32:19.970 --> 00:32:21.420
Here you go, Bret, Andrew.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:24.510
Sorry.

00:32:24.510 --> 00:32:27.468
I hope I'm not hitting anybody.

00:32:27.468 --> 00:32:28.860
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:28.860 --> 00:32:29.902
ADAM MARTIN: What's that?

00:32:29.902 --> 00:32:32.340
Yeah, that's the
advantage of these.

00:32:35.430 --> 00:32:37.700
All right.

00:32:37.700 --> 00:32:40.122
Here you go, Myles.

00:32:40.122 --> 00:32:42.744
Let's see.

00:32:42.744 --> 00:32:44.040
Here you go.

00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:46.110
Sorry.

00:32:46.110 --> 00:32:48.550
Someone take this.

00:32:48.550 --> 00:32:49.050
All right.

00:32:49.050 --> 00:32:49.950
What do we got here?

00:32:53.110 --> 00:32:54.630
Just got a little
chromosome here.

00:32:54.630 --> 00:33:00.958
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:00.958 --> 00:33:02.000
ADAM MARTIN: Oops, sorry.

00:33:06.210 --> 00:33:06.710
All right.

00:33:06.710 --> 00:33:08.810
Who doesn't have a chromosome?

00:33:08.810 --> 00:33:10.820
Everyone in the class
has a chromosome?

00:33:10.820 --> 00:33:11.990
All right.

00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:13.580
One of you want to come in here?

00:33:21.670 --> 00:33:22.170
All right.

00:33:22.170 --> 00:33:25.680
We'll see how constrained
we are in terms of space.

00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:28.680
I've never been this ambitious
and had this many chromosomes

00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:32.470
before, so I'm excited
to see how this works.

00:33:32.470 --> 00:33:35.200
So you each have a Swim Noodle.

00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:38.280
They're different colors,
so different colors

00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:41.160
represent different chromosomes.

00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:45.040
And then you also have Swim
Noodles that have tape on them.

00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:47.070
And these represent
different alleles

00:33:47.070 --> 00:33:48.330
from your other chromosomes.

00:33:48.330 --> 00:33:53.040
So these two chromosomes would
be homologs of each other, OK?

00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:54.210
Does that make sense?

00:33:54.210 --> 00:33:56.830
OK, great.

00:33:56.830 --> 00:33:57.330
All right.

00:33:57.330 --> 00:34:02.680
Now, the metaphase plate will
be along the center of the room.

00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:06.060
So let's first reenact mitosis.

00:34:06.060 --> 00:34:08.940
So why don't you guys
find your sister chromatid

00:34:08.940 --> 00:34:11.690
and then sort of align in
the middle of the room here?

00:34:15.420 --> 00:34:17.040
Sister or brother chromatid.

00:34:24.192 --> 00:34:24.900
How are we doing?

00:34:24.900 --> 00:34:27.500
Do we have enough space there?

00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:28.489
It's a little packed.

00:34:28.489 --> 00:34:32.330
You can see how the cell--

00:34:32.330 --> 00:34:34.400
can you imagine how packed
it is inside a cell?

00:34:37.050 --> 00:34:40.190
OK, everyone found
their sister chromatid.

00:34:40.190 --> 00:34:42.920
Normally, the sister
chromatids-- they replicate

00:34:42.920 --> 00:34:44.100
and they get held together.

00:34:44.100 --> 00:34:47.580
So there's no finding of
sister chromatids, but--

00:34:47.580 --> 00:34:48.080
all right.

00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:49.040
Great.

00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:53.290
So segregate and we'll
see how you guys did.

00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:00.540
All right.

00:35:00.540 --> 00:35:06.710
And the goal is that you guys
would be genetically identical.

00:35:06.710 --> 00:35:08.670
So how-- OK, great.

00:35:08.670 --> 00:35:13.290
That looks like one
short red, one short red.

00:35:13.290 --> 00:35:15.150
OK, that's good.

00:35:21.250 --> 00:35:25.320
They look genetically
identical to me.

00:35:25.320 --> 00:35:25.820
All right.

00:35:25.820 --> 00:35:27.650
So that was my mitosis.

00:35:27.650 --> 00:35:29.230
Now, we're going to do meiosis.

00:35:29.230 --> 00:35:33.590
OK, why don't you guys align,
like what would happen during

00:35:33.590 --> 00:35:38.640
meiosis I. OK, you
guys can come back.

00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:40.635
Think about who you're
going to pair with.

00:35:40.635 --> 00:35:42.060
[SIDE CONVERSATION]

00:36:10.900 --> 00:36:11.400
All right.

00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:13.760
So what were you looking
for when you were pairing?

00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:16.925
Who were you looking for?

00:36:16.925 --> 00:36:18.437
AUDIENCE: Longest chromosome.

00:36:18.437 --> 00:36:20.270
ADAM MARTIN: Your longest
chromosome, right?

00:36:20.270 --> 00:36:21.950
OK, great.

00:36:21.950 --> 00:36:22.450
All right.

00:36:22.450 --> 00:36:23.690
Why don't you guys segregate?

00:36:32.730 --> 00:36:36.210
All right, so that
was meiosis I. Meiosis

00:36:36.210 --> 00:36:40.530
I looks successful to me.

00:36:40.530 --> 00:36:43.170
And now, we have to
undergo meiosis II.

00:36:43.170 --> 00:36:45.470
So maybe what we could do
is you guys can rotate.

00:36:45.470 --> 00:36:50.290
And the metaphase spindle can
be sort of in this orientation.

00:36:50.290 --> 00:36:51.335
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:51.335 --> 00:36:52.710
ADAM MARTIN: Yeah,
that will-- we

00:36:52.710 --> 00:36:55.320
want a group over there, a
group over there, a group here,

00:36:55.320 --> 00:36:55.960
a group here.

00:36:55.960 --> 00:36:57.418
And those will be
our four gametes.

00:36:59.815 --> 00:37:01.252
[SIDE CONVERSATION]

00:37:05.570 --> 00:37:06.380
All right.

00:37:06.380 --> 00:37:08.210
You guys set?

00:37:08.210 --> 00:37:08.800
All right.

00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:10.664
Go.

00:37:10.664 --> 00:37:12.158
[SIDE CONVERSATION]

00:37:17.150 --> 00:37:18.870
OK, terrific.

00:37:18.870 --> 00:37:21.750
Everyone haploid?

00:37:21.750 --> 00:37:26.320
Looks like everyone is
haploid, which is good.

00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:26.820
Right?

00:37:26.820 --> 00:37:31.740
So let's just take a minute and
think about probability here.

00:37:31.740 --> 00:37:34.110
So what was the
probability that a gamete

00:37:34.110 --> 00:37:39.166
would end up with this orange
allele on the red chromosome?

00:37:39.166 --> 00:37:40.368
AUDIENCE: Half.

00:37:40.368 --> 00:37:41.410
ADAM MARTIN: Half, right?

00:37:41.410 --> 00:37:43.020
Because there are two, right?

00:37:43.020 --> 00:37:45.570
So these two gametes
have that allele.

00:37:45.570 --> 00:37:49.720
These two should not, right?

00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:50.640
OK, great.

00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:55.410
And we just had a
chromosome loss,

00:37:55.410 --> 00:37:58.220
so that gamete is in trouble.

00:38:02.430 --> 00:38:09.090
But maybe we could get a TA
to rescue this chromosome.

00:38:09.090 --> 00:38:11.210
Either one of you is fine.

00:38:11.210 --> 00:38:13.383
There you go, David.

00:38:13.383 --> 00:38:14.856
[SIDE CONVERSATION]

00:38:21.930 --> 00:38:22.430
All right.

00:38:22.430 --> 00:38:23.090
That was great.

00:38:23.090 --> 00:38:25.670
Now, let's-- as
you're doing this,

00:38:25.670 --> 00:38:30.020
you get a sense as to how things
could get mixed up, right?

00:38:30.020 --> 00:38:33.560
And you think inside
the cell, right?

00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:34.460
So I don't--

00:38:34.460 --> 00:38:36.770
I've lost track of
how many chromosomes.

00:38:36.770 --> 00:38:39.500
We have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, right?

00:38:39.500 --> 00:38:41.990
How many chromosomes do we have?

00:38:41.990 --> 00:38:42.542
AUDIENCE: 23.

00:38:42.542 --> 00:38:44.000
ADAM MARTIN: We
are-- a haploid set

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:45.588
for us is how many chromosomes?

00:38:45.588 --> 00:38:46.130
AUDIENCE: 23.

00:38:46.130 --> 00:38:46.850
ADAM MARTIN: 23.

00:38:46.850 --> 00:38:47.570
Exactly.

00:38:47.570 --> 00:38:48.410
Right?

00:38:48.410 --> 00:38:51.260
So it'd be even worse
for a human cell

00:38:51.260 --> 00:38:53.300
to get this to go right.

00:38:53.300 --> 00:38:56.570
So why don't you guys line up
in the mitosis configuration?

00:38:56.570 --> 00:38:59.140
And we'll consider some
things that could go wrong.

00:39:13.260 --> 00:39:14.430
All right.

00:39:14.430 --> 00:39:20.640
Who here is good friends
with their sister or brother

00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:21.290
chromatid?

00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:27.000
Is anyone very good friends
with their sister or brother

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:27.982
chromatid?

00:39:30.934 --> 00:39:32.402
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:32.902 --> 00:39:34.380
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:34.380 --> 00:39:36.000
ADAM MARTIN: Yeah.

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:41.040
Someone become good friends
and become inseparable, OK?

00:39:41.040 --> 00:39:43.890
Would someone volunteer
to be inseparable?

00:39:43.890 --> 00:39:44.430
OK, great.

00:39:44.430 --> 00:39:46.590
You guys are now
inseparable, OK?

00:39:46.590 --> 00:39:47.580
Now, segregate.

00:39:51.500 --> 00:39:52.090
OK, great.

00:39:55.830 --> 00:39:57.760
Now, what happened there?

00:39:57.760 --> 00:39:59.580
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:59.580 --> 00:40:00.830
ADAM MARTIN: What's that?

00:40:00.830 --> 00:40:02.372
AUDIENCE: He stole her.

00:40:02.372 --> 00:40:04.080
ADAM MARTIN: Yeah,
that's cell stole her.

00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:05.160
OK.

00:40:05.160 --> 00:40:10.187
So now, we have two-- a
duplication of that chromosome.

00:40:10.187 --> 00:40:12.270
What's happened over here
with this daughter cell?

00:40:12.270 --> 00:40:13.650
AUDIENCE: It's
missing a chromosome.

00:40:13.650 --> 00:40:15.567
ADAM MARTIN: It's missing
a chromosome, right?

00:40:15.567 --> 00:40:16.482
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:40:16.482 --> 00:40:17.940
ADAM MARTIN: So
these are the types

00:40:17.940 --> 00:40:21.300
of mistakes that can be
associated with a cell becoming

00:40:21.300 --> 00:40:22.350
cancerous, right?

00:40:22.350 --> 00:40:25.530
Because let's say
there was a gene

00:40:25.530 --> 00:40:28.410
that suppresses growth
on that chromosome.

00:40:28.410 --> 00:40:30.990
And it wasn't on that homolog.

00:40:30.990 --> 00:40:35.610
Then you might result in a
genetic sort of mutant or loss

00:40:35.610 --> 00:40:39.150
of that gene that would result
in uncontrolled proliferation.

00:40:39.150 --> 00:40:42.120
Also, picking up
the extra copies

00:40:42.120 --> 00:40:44.430
of genes that
promote growth could

00:40:44.430 --> 00:40:48.090
allow that cell to have a
proliferative advantage, OK?

00:40:48.090 --> 00:40:50.910
We're going to-- this is sort
of foreshadowing what we're

00:40:50.910 --> 00:40:52.390
going to talk about later.

00:40:52.390 --> 00:40:56.820
But I just want to
plant the seed now.

00:40:56.820 --> 00:40:57.320
OK.

00:40:57.320 --> 00:40:58.890
Why don't we go
back and do meiosis?

00:41:16.182 --> 00:41:19.668
[SIDE CONVERSATION]

00:41:29.332 --> 00:41:30.100
OK.

00:41:30.100 --> 00:41:34.870
Now, anyone see any friends
looking across the aisle now?

00:41:40.910 --> 00:41:41.410
All right.

00:41:41.410 --> 00:41:41.910
Great.

00:41:41.910 --> 00:41:43.420
You guys are now inseparable.

00:41:43.420 --> 00:41:49.190
Why don't you guys segregate,
except the inseparable ones?

00:41:49.190 --> 00:41:53.155
Oh, but your sister chromatids
still have to stay attached.

00:41:56.588 --> 00:41:57.130
There you go.

00:41:57.130 --> 00:41:59.060
See?

00:41:59.060 --> 00:42:00.940
Great.

00:42:00.940 --> 00:42:01.440
Right.

00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:03.160
So just like last
time, this is known

00:42:03.160 --> 00:42:06.670
as a non-disjunction event
where the chromosomes don't

00:42:06.670 --> 00:42:08.930
separate when they should, OK?

00:42:08.930 --> 00:42:09.430
Great.

00:42:09.430 --> 00:42:13.540
Now, why don't you
guys do meiosis II?

00:42:13.540 --> 00:42:15.025
[SIDE CONVERSATION]

00:42:27.180 --> 00:42:27.680
All right.

00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:28.550
You can segregate.

00:42:35.850 --> 00:42:36.350
All right.

00:42:36.350 --> 00:42:40.040
Now, you see these
two gametes over here

00:42:40.040 --> 00:42:43.590
are lacking an entire
orange chromosome.

00:42:43.590 --> 00:42:47.540
And these two gametes here have
picked up an additional copy

00:42:47.540 --> 00:42:49.970
of an orange chromosome, OK?

00:42:49.970 --> 00:42:52.550
So these two gametes
are no longer

00:42:52.550 --> 00:42:57.030
haploid for the
orange chromosome.

00:42:57.030 --> 00:42:59.690
And if one of these
gametes were to fuse

00:42:59.690 --> 00:43:04.130
with a haploid gamete that
has an orange chromosome,

00:43:04.130 --> 00:43:07.880
then now you have
a zygote that has

00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:12.500
three copies of the orange
chromosome, which is abnormal,

00:43:12.500 --> 00:43:13.280
OK?

00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:16.520
So if that were
chromosome 21 in humans,

00:43:16.520 --> 00:43:20.150
that would result in something
that's called trisomy 21, which

00:43:20.150 --> 00:43:21.830
is down syndrome, OK?

00:43:21.830 --> 00:43:26.330
So you see how mistakes in
how chromosomes segregate

00:43:26.330 --> 00:43:29.000
can result in human disease.

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:29.520
OK.

00:43:29.520 --> 00:43:31.550
Why don't we give
yourselves a hand?

00:43:31.550 --> 00:43:32.160
Good job.

00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:33.582
[APPLAUSE]

00:43:34.530 --> 00:43:37.250
OK, you can just throw the
Pool Noodles on the side.

00:43:37.250 --> 00:43:39.170
And I just have one
slide to show you

00:43:39.170 --> 00:43:42.085
where we're going next.

00:43:42.085 --> 00:43:42.640

[SIDE CONVERSATION]

00:43:46.748 --> 00:43:48.040
AUDIENCE: So I have a question.

00:43:48.040 --> 00:43:48.630
ADAM MARTIN: Yeah?

00:43:48.630 --> 00:43:50.630
AUDIENCE: When the
homologous chromosomes split,

00:43:50.630 --> 00:43:51.875
can you share alleles?

00:43:51.875 --> 00:43:53.843
Are there alleles
preserved in this portion?

00:43:53.843 --> 00:43:56.010
ADAM MARTIN: You're asking
if there's crossing over?

00:43:56.010 --> 00:43:56.550
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:43:56.550 --> 00:43:57.470
ADAM MARTIN: There
is crossing over.

00:43:57.470 --> 00:43:58.040
Yes.

00:43:58.040 --> 00:44:00.940
And that will get its
own entire lecture.

00:44:00.940 --> 00:44:02.000
Yes, good question.

00:44:09.290 --> 00:44:13.620
OK, so just to give you guys
a preview of what's up next.

00:44:13.620 --> 00:44:16.020
So in the next
lecture, we're going

00:44:16.020 --> 00:44:19.430
to talk about Mendel
and Mendel's peas.

00:44:19.430 --> 00:44:23.090
And we'll talk about the
laws of inheritance, OK?

00:44:23.090 --> 00:44:28.850
And realize Mendel
was way before DNA

00:44:28.850 --> 00:44:33.110
or what our knowledge
of a gene was, OK?

00:44:33.110 --> 00:44:37.460
Next, we'll talk about fruit
flies, and Thomas Hunt Morgan,

00:44:37.460 --> 00:44:43.160
and seminal work that led to the
chromosome model of inheritance

00:44:43.160 --> 00:44:46.730
and also resulted in
the concepts of linkage

00:44:46.730 --> 00:44:49.850
and also genetic maps.

00:44:49.850 --> 00:44:50.990
OK, we're going to go--

00:44:50.990 --> 00:44:55.010
well, just to sort of anchor
yourself, the structure of DNA

00:44:55.010 --> 00:44:57.530
was published in 1953.

00:44:57.530 --> 00:45:00.380
So these seminal
genetic studies up here

00:45:00.380 --> 00:45:03.090
were done before
we knew about DNA.

00:45:03.090 --> 00:45:06.830
So geneticists were studying
genes and their behavior

00:45:06.830 --> 00:45:10.940
well before we knew DNA
was what was responsible.

00:45:10.940 --> 00:45:14.150
And then we'll talk about
sequencing and the sequencing

00:45:14.150 --> 00:45:15.680
revolution.

00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:18.740
We'll talk about cloning,
and molecular biology,

00:45:18.740 --> 00:45:21.380
and how one might go
from a human disease

00:45:21.380 --> 00:45:24.417
to a specific gene
that causes it.

00:45:24.417 --> 00:45:26.000
And then, finally,
we'll start talking

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:30.940
about entire human genome
and genome sequences.

00:45:30.940 --> 00:45:33.900
OK, so that's just a preview
of where we're going,

00:45:33.900 --> 00:45:36.730
so have a great weekend.

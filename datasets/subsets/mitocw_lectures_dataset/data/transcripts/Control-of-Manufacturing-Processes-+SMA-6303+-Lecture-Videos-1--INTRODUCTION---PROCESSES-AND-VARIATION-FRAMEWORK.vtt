00:00:22.987 --> 00:00:25.920
DUANE BONING: So I want
to welcome everybody here

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.110
in Singapore-- or
there in Singapore,

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:29.850
and here in Cambridge.

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:31.020
My name is Duane Boning.

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:34.380
I'll be one of the two
lecturers for our class.

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.050
We'll get into some
of those logistics

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.760
and details in a
minute, but we've

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.470
got some preliminary things.

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:45.510
Since we've started
videotaping you already,

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.620
one thing you need to know
is there is a video recording

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:50.580
policy.

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:54.630
Pretty much everybody
here will be videotaped.

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:57.360
If you don't want
to be videotaped,

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.780
there are a couple of
seats here on the right.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.310
If you do want to
be videotaped, you

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:05.550
can come and be
accessible and viewable.

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:08.970
Right at the front, you can see
there's these little red tabs

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.410
on the desk.

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:12.330
That's in the blind
spot of the video.

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.910
I think some of these
were being handed out

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:22.380
as you were coming in, but
if you didn't get them,

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.365
here's another copy of
that videotaping policy.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.590
So what we do is most of these
lectures are, of course, live,

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.950
video linked with Singapore.

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.110
There are occasions
in the calendar

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.830
where it's a holiday in
one place or the other.

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.380
When it's a holiday
here, we don't meet.

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.170
When it's a whole holiday in
Singapore, but not a holiday

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.930
here, we will still
meet here in Cambridge,

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.920
but the video version
of the local lecture

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.210
will be available on the website
so that folks in Singapore

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.330
can catch up on that.

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.720
And in fact, we understand
the first one of those

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.669
is this coming Thursday.

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:10.860
Is everybody ready
for your holiday?

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.866
It's been a long, hard
term already, right?

00:02:14.866 --> 00:02:16.780
Is that right, Singapore?

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.113
OK.

00:02:18.113 --> 00:02:19.530
Yeah, that's the
Chinese New Year,

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.380
so there will be no class
meeting in Singapore

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:23.520
on Thursday evening.

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:27.190
Let's see.

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.910
OK.

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:39.140
Has everybody found their way
to the Stellar website already?

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.430
Anybody who has not seen the
Stellar website for this class?

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:50.080
I'm asking in part because,
if you are not actually

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.450
registered-- let me go to
the Stellar site here--

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.170
oh, this may not be
viewable in Singapore.

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.350
This is accessible only to
those registered in the class,

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.060
I believe.

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.300
So if you're having trouble
getting to the website,

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.900
please email me right away, and
we will add you to the roster,

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.810
even before you get registered.

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:16.400
It will be important,
because all

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.840
of the materials
for the class are

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.480
deployed through the website.

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.440
In fact, it'll be very rare when
we have any kind of handouts

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.180
to give in class.

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:34.840
Lecture notes, reading material,
reading back-up, assignments,

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.240
weekly problem sets--
all of that material

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:38.200
is through the website.

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.462
Now, what I will typically do--

00:03:44.462 --> 00:03:45.920
let me see if I
can get back here--

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:54.960
usually I will try to have
the PowerPoint slides loaded

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:58.600
a day before the lecture.

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.320
One thing that I noticed in
a few past years is sometimes

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:06.300
little groups of students
would work together

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:11.340
and delegate somebody to
print out the lecture slides

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.560
and bring a set of copies
for their little group.

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.160
So for example, the LFM
students would often

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.180
have one person printing out
that morning or the night

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:22.620
before, if they were available.

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.210
So you guys can self-organize.

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:26.970
If you actually like having
any kind of print-out

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:32.250
to take notes on a copy
of the PowerPoint slides,

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:35.730
feel free to print those
out or self-organize

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:38.970
to share that duty.

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:43.320
Again, we're not going to
be making copies available

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.960
directly in the class.

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:51.390
So what I want to do, first
off, is talk a little bit

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:56.262
about the class and the assumed
prerequisites for the class,

00:04:56.262 --> 00:04:57.720
and then we'll come
back and I want

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.120
to get us to know each other.

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:03.150
I know many of you have
had some classes together.

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:06.580
Others of you are perhaps
new to each other,

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:09.040
so want to share a
little bit of experiences

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:12.810
so we know what the
basin of experience is--

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:16.980
because this class is meant
to be fairly interactive.

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:20.790
It is a manufacturing
process control class,

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:24.150
and one of the best things
about it is many of the students

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:26.942
in the class have an
awful lot of experience.

00:05:26.942 --> 00:05:28.650
For example, the
students and the leaders

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:31.860
for manufacturing program,
LFM, are typically

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:35.500
coming from several years
of industrial experience.

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:38.640
Similarly, students
have had a lot

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:43.080
of experience, whether it
be doing experimental work

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:44.670
with processes in--

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:47.950
as part of their program,
or what have you.

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:51.450
So it is meant to
be interactive.

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:53.620
We depend on you sharing
your experiences,

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:56.580
your insights, your doubts.

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:00.150
In many cases, those can be
often the most interesting part

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:00.970
of the subject--

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:02.930
say, I tried that-- didn't work.

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:06.540
Here's why-- because a lot
of the classes about tools

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:12.120
and experiences for dealing
with manufacturing processes.

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:14.860
And then we'll get into a
little bit more of the details,

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:19.770
some of the course schedule,
and some of the other logistics.

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:22.680
Jumping ahead a little
bit here, there's

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:28.110
kind of a long chain listed
formally on the course

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:30.270
catalog for prerequisites--

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:36.270
says things like 2.008,
or 2.810, or 6152J,

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:42.240
and then also a couple of other
subjects like 6041 or 15064J.

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:46.350
What we intend to convey with
these prerequisites is, number

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:49.200
one, they're not specific
hard prerequisites

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:50.460
for those subjects.

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:55.650
What we mean to convey is
you should have hopefully

00:06:55.650 --> 00:07:00.160
some substantial experience
with some manufacturing process.

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:03.750
So that's things
like 2810, 6152J.

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:08.850
So 2810 is essentially the
manufacturing physics subject--

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:11.715
manufacturing processes
subject in course two.

00:07:11.715 --> 00:07:13.530
I recognize some
of you for that.

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:20.000
I think I gave a guest
lecturer in that subject

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.800
on semiconductor manufacturing.

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:24.860
So that would be one example.

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:29.540
6152J is a course six,
electrical engineering computer

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:33.020
science subject on
microfabrication--

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:37.550
not only semiconductor, but
also MEMS microfabrication.

00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:40.070
And so that would be another
example through coursework,

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:42.590
where you might have gotten
that kind of experience.

00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:45.500
And then similarly, you
might have actual true

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:47.160
industrial experience.

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:51.800
So the goal here is actually
to just go deep enough

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:55.670
or build on a deep enough
knowledge of some process

00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:57.350
technology.

00:07:57.350 --> 00:08:01.010
This semester of the
subject, I will actually

00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:06.440
be using semiconductor process
technology a little bit

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:09.380
more than we have some
semesters in the past

00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:13.220
to illustrate, and
demonstrate, and to get

00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:16.040
some practice with
some of the concepts

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:17.390
that we're dealing with here.

00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:19.400
But many of the
problems will also

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:23.000
deal with macroscopic
processes, from metal

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:29.910
bending to forming and
other sorts of processes.

00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:33.559
A little later, we expect Dave
Hardt, who is the collector.

00:08:33.559 --> 00:08:34.370
He'll be here.

00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:37.789
And his background
especially emphasizes

00:08:37.789 --> 00:08:43.047
the panoply of mechanical
and broad based process

00:08:43.047 --> 00:08:45.380
technologies, whereas my
experience is a little bit more

00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:48.110
solidly in microfabrication--

00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:50.930
both in semiconductor,
and more recently,

00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:55.520
in micro-electromechanical
systems, or MEMS fabrication.

00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:57.140
So that's one of
the prerequisites.

00:08:57.140 --> 00:09:00.410
Now, the other prerequisite
that we kind of assume--

00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:02.930
and if you don't have, you
might be doing a little bit

00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:05.120
of quick background reading--

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:08.870
is indicated by things
like 6041 or 15064,

00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:13.970
and that is some basic
probability and statistics.

00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:16.910
We'll actually be developing
quite a bit of the statistical

00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:18.770
machinery, so if you don't--

00:09:18.770 --> 00:09:22.550
haven't had a full subject
in that, not to worry--

00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:25.690
I recognize many
of you also from--

00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:29.900
is it 2.853, 2.854?

00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:31.220
Get that subject right--

00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:34.380
that's Stan Gershwin's
manufacturing process?

00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:34.880
What is it?

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:38.330
Manufacturing
systems-- manufacturing

00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:42.260
systems, where we had a two
or three-lecture sequence

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:46.550
on basic statistics and
statistical modeling.

00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:49.230
We'll actually
revisit some of that,

00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:51.170
so you'll see some of
that again, but then

00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:54.110
be applying that to
problems of manufacturing.

00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:00.520
I'll go over this
detail, and then we'll

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:05.260
come back to get some
introductions from you guys.

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:09.400
This semester we actually
have two required textbooks.

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:13.720
The great thing is a
new book has come out.

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:17.200
It came out nominally 2006,
but it was only available

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:18.610
starting last year.

00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:23.140
And that's a book by Gary
May and Costas Spanos.

00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:24.390
Gary May is at Georgia Tech.

00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:29.470
Costas Spanos at UC Berkeley,
and they had developed a course

00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:32.680
on semiconductor
process control that

00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:36.190
was very close to a subject
in the dim, dark past

00:10:36.190 --> 00:10:39.700
that I used to teach dedicated
entirely to semiconductor

00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:41.030
process control.

00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:43.090
So finally, we have
a book for that.

00:10:43.090 --> 00:10:47.590
It's a nice condensed book, and
you all should try to get that,

00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:49.480
because we're going
to have readings

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:52.210
from this book starting
pretty quickly.

00:10:52.210 --> 00:10:55.120
So you might have
to go to Amazon,

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:57.310
do two-day shipping or
something like that.

00:10:57.310 --> 00:11:00.772
If somebody has
Amazon Prime, you

00:11:00.772 --> 00:11:02.230
can use that and
get free shipping.

00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:04.570
I don't know if
any of you do that.

00:11:04.570 --> 00:11:08.380
The other book is Introduction
to Statistical Quality Control.

00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:11.080
This is more broad based.

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:14.050
May and Spanos illustrate
everything the semiconductor

00:11:14.050 --> 00:11:17.050
process technology.

00:11:17.050 --> 00:11:22.210
Montgomery is basically a
statistical process control,

00:11:22.210 --> 00:11:25.000
a little bit of
design of experiment.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.400
It really emphasizes the
statistical machinery

00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:29.750
that we're going to be using.

00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:32.680
So you are expected
to either go and get

00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:34.780
both of those--
both of these books

00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:38.170
have been put on reserve
in the MIT library,

00:11:38.170 --> 00:11:41.800
so if you don't want to spend
the money, you can, I guess,

00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:44.440
do the painful thing of
trying to go to the library

00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:45.790
and read there.

00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:52.250
At least the Montgomery
book is a great book

00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:55.020
to have on your
bookshelf long term.

00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:58.190
It'll be a great reference
book throughout your career.

00:11:58.190 --> 00:12:00.200
The semiconductor process
control-- certainly,

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:02.600
if you're going in the
semiconductor area, that's

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:05.170
also very useful.

00:12:05.170 --> 00:12:06.760
OK, so the grading
in the class--

00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:10.240
the way this works
is we will have--

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:13.060
I think it's something like
eight weekly problem sets,

00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:15.402
primarily in the first
2/3 of the class.

00:12:15.402 --> 00:12:17.110
And then, in the last
third of the class,

00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:23.090
we stop the problem sets and
you'll go into a team project.

00:12:23.090 --> 00:12:25.090
The problem sets will
comprise about 40%

00:12:25.090 --> 00:12:26.620
of the grade in the class.

00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:29.200
We'll have two quizzes--

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:33.520
one about a little bit more
than a third of the way through,

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:38.570
another one a little bit more
than 2/3 of the way through.

00:12:38.570 --> 00:12:42.950
Those are about 40% of
the grade in the class.

00:12:42.950 --> 00:12:45.590
The good thing about having
those quizzes during the term

00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:49.930
is we do not have a final exam.

00:12:49.930 --> 00:12:51.310
Anybody heartbroken about that?

00:12:51.310 --> 00:12:52.810
[APPLAUSE]

00:12:52.810 --> 00:12:53.950
OK.

00:12:53.950 --> 00:12:57.070
However, the reason
we don't is that,

00:12:57.070 --> 00:12:59.560
in that last third
quarter of the class,

00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:01.870
we switched gears a
little bit and ask

00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:05.440
you to start applying some of
the techniques and tools that

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:07.600
will have been talked
about through most

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:09.922
of the semester
in a team project.

00:13:09.922 --> 00:13:11.380
I'll talk more
about what that team

00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:15.110
project is a little bit later.

00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:20.880
So that's meant to be a
fairly substantial effort.

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:24.600
The team project is going
to be a team project.

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:30.630
It's going to be typically
three-student teams.

00:13:30.630 --> 00:13:35.250
And of course, that should be
very collaborative in nature.

00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:38.310
In contrast to that,
the other assignments

00:13:38.310 --> 00:13:43.170
are meant to be
individual efforts.

00:13:43.170 --> 00:13:46.230
Now, working on
the problem set, I

00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:49.410
think it's great to interact,
talk with each other

00:13:49.410 --> 00:13:52.230
to understand the problems,
even to bounce off

00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:56.190
possible lines of attack
or solution approaches,

00:13:56.190 --> 00:13:57.390
but where we mean--

00:13:57.390 --> 00:14:00.130
especially on the assignments--
the weekly assignments,

00:14:00.130 --> 00:14:02.160
the problems sets--
is everybody should do

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:04.170
their own independent write-up.

00:14:04.170 --> 00:14:08.130
I find that writing
and explaining not just

00:14:08.130 --> 00:14:10.560
writing down the answer
number, by the way.

00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:13.890
We will expect
actual articulation

00:14:13.890 --> 00:14:16.770
of your thought process.

00:14:16.770 --> 00:14:20.620
That should be an
individual effort.

00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:24.170
Now, we'll come back to that
the assignments a little bit.

00:14:24.170 --> 00:14:26.860
We'll try to emphasize this,
perhaps, as well a little bit

00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:29.050
more on the
assignments themselves.

00:14:29.050 --> 00:14:30.610
The perspective I'd
kind of like you

00:14:30.610 --> 00:14:33.700
to take on these
weekly problem sets

00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:38.740
is not that you're trying to
come up with the answer number

00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:43.310
like you might on an exam
or something like that,

00:14:43.310 --> 00:14:46.510
where you just needed
the number, but instead,

00:14:46.510 --> 00:14:52.600
a little bit of what I think of
as a practicing manufacturing

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:55.060
perspective--

00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:57.100
I couldn't call it an
industrial perspective

00:14:57.100 --> 00:14:59.890
or an academic perspective,
but the key thing

00:14:59.890 --> 00:15:01.360
that you have to
do, and will have

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:03.175
to do throughout your
career is convince.

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:09.040
So you have to convince
us that the answer

00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:14.500
that you're putting down makes
sense, why it's reasonable.

00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:17.020
So you need to articulate
the thought process,

00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:19.370
not just come up with answers.

00:15:19.370 --> 00:15:21.370
And that's part of the
reason why we really

00:15:21.370 --> 00:15:26.123
want that to be an individual
effort, an individual write-up.

00:15:26.123 --> 00:15:27.540
And of course,
everybody's already

00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:31.780
gotten to the course URL.

00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:35.680
So going backwards a step
here, let me introduce--

00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:37.900
I hoped that Dave
would be here by now--

00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:40.810
must be having a very
difficult decision point

00:15:40.810 --> 00:15:44.930
and in the voting booth
there-- who to vote for.

00:15:44.930 --> 00:15:46.240
Again, I'm Duane Boning.

00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:49.000
I'm a professor of electrical
engineering and computer

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.620
science.

00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:51.250
Dave Hardt.

00:15:51.250 --> 00:15:52.630
Will be here a little bit later.

00:15:52.630 --> 00:15:56.170
Let me introduce for you
the teaching assistant,

00:15:56.170 --> 00:15:58.270
Hayden Taylor.

00:15:58.270 --> 00:15:59.450
We do have microphones here.

00:15:59.450 --> 00:16:01.120
Why don't you say
a couple of words?

00:16:01.255 --> 00:16:02.338
HAYDEN TAYLOR: [INAUDIBLE]

00:16:02.338 --> 00:16:03.508
DUANE BONING: Yeah-- good.

00:16:03.508 --> 00:16:04.300
There's the camera.

00:16:04.407 --> 00:16:05.740
HAYDEN TAYLOR: Hello, Singapore.

00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:07.930
I'm Hayden.

00:16:07.930 --> 00:16:09.260
I'm in electrical engineering.

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:12.430
I work with Duane on
manufacturing approaches

00:16:12.430 --> 00:16:14.650
for microfluidic devices.

00:16:14.650 --> 00:16:16.540
We work a lot with polymers.

00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:19.630
And I'm excited to work
with you all this time.

00:16:19.630 --> 00:16:22.840
Feel free to email
me at any time.

00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:25.910
I'll be organizing
office hours, and I'll

00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:29.680
announce that on the website
when the time has come.

00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:32.050
For those of you in
Singapore, I suppose

00:16:32.050 --> 00:16:33.820
we'll have to have
virtual office hours.

00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:36.100
I'm very happy to talk
over Skype or something

00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:39.651
like that, if you want, so
feel free to drop me an email.

00:16:39.651 --> 00:16:40.151
Thanks.

00:16:44.005 --> 00:16:45.380
DUANE BONING: And
Hayden just got

00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:49.077
back a little over a week ago--
is that right-- from Singapore.

00:16:49.077 --> 00:16:50.600
HAYDEN TAYLOR: That's right.

00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:52.517
DUANE BONING: [? We ?]
spent a couple of weeks

00:16:52.517 --> 00:16:54.920
there for some of the
SMA program things.

00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:57.350
The core secretary
will be my assistant

00:16:57.350 --> 00:17:03.500
over near my office in EECS
headquarters in building 38.

00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:05.359
And that's
[? Charlene Blake. ?] So if you

00:17:05.359 --> 00:17:07.790
have some administrative
questions,

00:17:07.790 --> 00:17:12.140
your best bet is probably
emailing Hayden and me

00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:13.460
directly.

00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:16.790
I'll be the lead
lecturer this term.

00:17:16.790 --> 00:17:18.890
Normally, Dave Hardt
is the lead lecturer.

00:17:18.890 --> 00:17:23.569
He's actually nominally on
sabbatical this term, but--

00:17:23.569 --> 00:17:26.930
so I'll be taking care of more
of the administrative things,

00:17:26.930 --> 00:17:30.300
and he'll get to
give fun lectures.

00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:33.260
So if you have administrative
things, please--

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:36.500
probably best to contact
either me or Hayden directly.

00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:39.920
If you have questions
or need to drop off,

00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:44.030
for example, late
problem sets, that

00:17:44.030 --> 00:17:46.830
can be done with [? Charlene. ?]

00:17:46.830 --> 00:17:49.260
And we'll have to have to
let [? Charlene ?] know

00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:52.900
that she really outdid
herself on the breakfast here.

00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:55.620
So at any time, as soon
as you're done with one,

00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:57.150
we have lots more
to eat, so feel

00:17:57.150 --> 00:18:00.570
free to wander over and
grab a little bit more.

00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:05.480
OK, we'll dive back
into a little bit more

00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:08.450
about the course, but I thought
it would be a little bit

00:18:08.450 --> 00:18:13.370
fun to just quickly go around
and hear a sentence or two

00:18:13.370 --> 00:18:14.300
about--

00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:17.420
and I'm particularly
interested in what kind

00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:21.500
of process background, or
manufacturing background,

00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:24.140
or technology
background you have--

00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:27.230
or if you don't have much
background, what kind of areas

00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:32.430
you're especially interested in,
or potentially interested in.

00:18:32.430 --> 00:18:37.610
So we'll do that quickly here
on the Cambridge end first.

00:18:37.610 --> 00:18:41.250
I know many of you, again, have
been taking classes together,

00:18:41.250 --> 00:18:43.930
so you know each other
better than I you.

00:18:43.930 --> 00:18:47.060
I recognize some faces
here a little bit.

00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:50.540
But this is part of my way to
get to you as well as for you

00:18:50.540 --> 00:18:52.910
guys to get to know each other.

00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:07.243
OK, let me go through a
few of the other logistics,

00:19:07.243 --> 00:19:09.160
and then we'll start
getting into a little bit

00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:13.340
of introductory material.

00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:15.340
I think we've already
done some of that.

00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:20.813
Let me come back to
the team projects,

00:19:20.813 --> 00:19:22.230
because I think
it'll be important

00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:25.440
for you folks to be
starting to think very

00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:31.770
early about possible projects
and possible team formation,

00:19:31.770 --> 00:19:35.400
because that will help--
as you're learning some

00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:38.880
of the tools and techniques
in these different kinds

00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:43.360
of topical areas, you
can pay more attention,

00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:45.210
because you'll
know, OK, I really

00:19:45.210 --> 00:19:47.820
want to think about
process diagnosis

00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:50.830
for this particular
project, or what have you.

00:19:50.830 --> 00:19:53.310
So the typical kinds of topics--

00:19:53.310 --> 00:19:56.400
generically, the topics
in these team projects

00:19:56.400 --> 00:20:00.060
involve things like
process diagnosis;

00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:02.490
process improvement,
often with a little bit

00:20:02.490 --> 00:20:07.170
of statistical process
control, detection,

00:20:07.170 --> 00:20:11.550
and debug kinds of things;
process optimization

00:20:11.550 --> 00:20:13.230
and robustness--

00:20:13.230 --> 00:20:15.930
things like use of
design of experiments

00:20:15.930 --> 00:20:19.290
to characterize the
process, and then

00:20:19.290 --> 00:20:23.460
seek to optimize some
outputs, as well as minimize

00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:26.910
some variations and get
to a robust process;

00:20:26.910 --> 00:20:29.910
and then a number of more
advanced applications,

00:20:29.910 --> 00:20:32.850
perhaps dealing with things
like yield modeling or defect

00:20:32.850 --> 00:20:34.020
modeling--

00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:36.750
these sorts of projects.

00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:39.270
And the basic expectation
in these team projects

00:20:39.270 --> 00:20:41.040
is you'll need to
learn a little bit

00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:44.820
more background on
the basic process

00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:47.550
and what the problem is.

00:20:47.550 --> 00:20:53.670
A really interesting aspect of
these projects is it's best--

00:20:53.670 --> 00:20:56.540
it really works
nicely if we can tap

00:20:56.540 --> 00:21:00.800
into a nice rich set
of existing data,

00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:03.590
or in some cases, even
generation of new data

00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:06.043
arising out of either
your past experience

00:21:06.043 --> 00:21:07.085
or your current research.

00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:13.940
So for example, one of the,
say, typical three-team members

00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:16.730
might have access to--

00:21:16.730 --> 00:21:21.560
hopefully only public,
shareable-- nothing secret--

00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:24.740
public data from
their work experience.

00:21:28.130 --> 00:21:31.280
Some of you may have
generated a big set of data

00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:34.140
for your master's
thesis, or this or that,

00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:38.090
and we're only able to look
at this aspect of the problem,

00:21:38.090 --> 00:21:39.920
because that was
the key question,

00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:41.900
but it was sort
of nagging at you.

00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:43.820
There's all this other
rich data that you

00:21:43.820 --> 00:21:47.210
would have thought it
interesting to look

00:21:47.210 --> 00:21:49.430
at from other perspectives--

00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:55.070
things like building very simple
response surface models for.

00:21:55.070 --> 00:21:58.000
But you didn't really have the
chance to go down that path.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:02.030
So keep your mind open,
thinking ahead to the project

00:22:02.030 --> 00:22:04.340
as we go out-- go
throughout the term,

00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:06.650
and say, oh, that's
an interesting topic.

00:22:06.650 --> 00:22:08.510
That's an interesting technique.

00:22:08.510 --> 00:22:10.910
That reminds me of a
very interesting data

00:22:10.910 --> 00:22:14.750
set that I came across back
a year ago or whatever--

00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:16.940
because that might form
the basis for a very

00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:18.090
interesting team project.

00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:24.180
The output of this
are two parts.

00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:27.510
There will be a
world presentation.

00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:29.440
So the team will present--

00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:31.790
in fact, the last
two class periods,

00:22:31.790 --> 00:22:34.820
the very last week of
class, will be dedicated

00:22:34.820 --> 00:22:36.680
to these team presentations.

00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:39.530
And then there will also
be a project report.

00:22:39.530 --> 00:22:41.480
Unlike the problem
sets, where everybody

00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:44.540
writes their own
separate problem set,

00:22:44.540 --> 00:22:47.630
the team writes
the project report.

00:22:47.630 --> 00:22:50.660
So that's one document that
comes together from the team.

00:22:53.390 --> 00:22:58.535
Good-- so let me pop back.

00:22:58.535 --> 00:23:00.410
We're not going to ask
you who you voted for,

00:23:00.410 --> 00:23:04.120
but we figured it was a
tough decision, because it

00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:07.102
was taking a little while.

00:23:07.102 --> 00:23:08.810
We've already done
all the introductions,

00:23:08.810 --> 00:23:11.655
so now you, fortunately,
know most everybody.

00:23:11.655 --> 00:23:13.405
DAVID HARDT: I hope
everybody knows that I

00:23:13.405 --> 00:23:16.403
got dressed for the occasion.

00:23:16.403 --> 00:23:17.320
What am I [INAUDIBLE]?

00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:19.612
DUANE BONING: You have to
wear a tie to vote in the US.

00:23:19.612 --> 00:23:21.000
You may not know that.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.390
DAVID HARDT: For those of you
who don't already know me,

00:23:22.390 --> 00:23:23.200
I'm David Hardt.

00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:25.660
And I'm actually on sabbatical
this semester, which

00:23:25.660 --> 00:23:27.250
means I don't teach
any classes and I

00:23:27.250 --> 00:23:28.420
don't sit on any committees.

00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:29.860
DUANE BONING: Why do you wear
a tie if you're on sabbatical?

00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:31.660
DAVID HARDT: So I'm here
today to sit on a committee

00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:32.535
and do some teaching.

00:23:32.535 --> 00:23:34.150
Yeah.

00:23:34.150 --> 00:23:37.450
But I welcome you all
to probably the best

00:23:37.450 --> 00:23:39.190
class at MIT--

00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:43.312
and hello to all of our students
there in Singapore as well.

00:23:43.312 --> 00:23:44.770
I hope you're
enjoying the weather.

00:23:44.770 --> 00:23:46.240
It's beautiful here.

00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:48.130
And the only reason
I'm late is that I

00:23:48.130 --> 00:23:50.800
had to drive the other way to
get to the polling station,

00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:52.640
and I got trapped by
a huge traffic jam.

00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:55.600
So I'm a dedicated voter.

00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:56.850
DUANE BONING: Thank you, Dave.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.895
OK, so let's get a
little bit into the--

00:24:05.895 --> 00:24:07.770
an overview of what
we're going to be dealing

00:24:07.770 --> 00:24:10.560
with throughout the
semester, and then dive

00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:14.790
in a little bit on some
concepts and basic background

00:24:14.790 --> 00:24:16.180
and terminology.

00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:20.100
So some of the key ideas that
we're after in this subject

00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:25.610
is really dealing with basically
the problems in manufacturing.

00:24:25.610 --> 00:24:28.790
And the biggest problem
of all is really

00:24:28.790 --> 00:24:32.710
dealing with quality and
manufacturing variation.

00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:36.770
Other aspects of
manufacturing are often

00:24:36.770 --> 00:24:42.050
very particular to the specific
process technology that's

00:24:42.050 --> 00:24:45.920
arising, but there's a
lot of very generic issues

00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:49.580
with variation, and the
control, and elimination,

00:24:49.580 --> 00:24:52.550
and modeling of the
process, and the variation,

00:24:52.550 --> 00:24:54.230
and ways to reduce it.

00:24:54.230 --> 00:24:58.310
So in some sense,
dealing with variation

00:24:58.310 --> 00:25:01.880
is one of the key
themes in the subject.

00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:04.520
And what we're going to start
with in the first couple

00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:07.970
of lectures is basically
dive in, get a little bit

00:25:07.970 --> 00:25:11.030
of process physics background.

00:25:11.030 --> 00:25:13.820
On Thursday, we'll dive
in a little bit more

00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:17.060
on semiconductor fabrication,
and then, on Tuesday, we'll

00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:19.280
see a variety--

00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:25.230
Dave will talk about a variety
of forging and other process

00:25:25.230 --> 00:25:28.970
examples that give a wider
perspective on manufacturing,

00:25:28.970 --> 00:25:32.180
and the physics that
are at work, and where

00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:38.610
variation naturally, inherently
arises in those processes.

00:25:38.610 --> 00:25:41.900
Then, well, once we've got a
little bit of a feel for where

00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:43.970
variation comes
from, we want to dive

00:25:43.970 --> 00:25:47.750
into some of the techniques for
understanding that and dealing

00:25:47.750 --> 00:25:48.350
with it.

00:25:48.350 --> 00:25:50.990
And that really gets us
into statistical models.

00:25:54.950 --> 00:25:58.310
And we'll talk in great
length about the contrast

00:25:58.310 --> 00:26:01.700
between physical models
of the process based

00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:07.400
on detailed understanding
of the specific mechanisms

00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:12.080
at work versus empirical
modeling of the process based

00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:13.310
on data--

00:26:13.310 --> 00:26:16.100
data and observations.

00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:20.810
The wonderful thing
about data is it's real

00:26:20.810 --> 00:26:24.740
and it encompasses all of
both the ideal behavior

00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:26.840
and the non-ideal behavior.

00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:29.000
And a lot of what we've
dealing with, again,

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:32.000
is the problems, really
trying to understand

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:37.760
where variation is coming from,
what its characteristics are.

00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:41.790
If we can start to get a model
for some of that variation,

00:26:41.790 --> 00:26:43.280
now we've got a
handle that we can

00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:46.270
use to try to eliminate it--

00:26:46.270 --> 00:26:48.640
either eliminate it
up front or control it

00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:51.930
and compensate for it.

00:26:51.930 --> 00:26:54.540
Some of the techniques that
we deal with for dealing with,

00:26:54.540 --> 00:26:57.120
again, that data is
building effects models,

00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:58.680
designed experiments.

00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:02.010
You may have run across
DOE, design of experiments.

00:27:02.010 --> 00:27:04.110
It's a form of
statistical technique,

00:27:04.110 --> 00:27:07.560
and we will be learning
the details of that

00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:10.410
and applying some
of those approaches

00:27:10.410 --> 00:27:14.190
with basic input-output
data sets and data models,

00:27:14.190 --> 00:27:19.010
both in specifying the
right set of experiments

00:27:19.010 --> 00:27:22.670
to perform to very
efficiently sample sample

00:27:22.670 --> 00:27:26.290
our process, and then
the ways to model that.

00:27:26.290 --> 00:27:28.040
And perhaps one of the
most important ways

00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:31.280
of using those empirical models
that we get of the process

00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:34.820
is to improve the process, do
process optimization, really

00:27:34.820 --> 00:27:38.960
looking for improved operating
points that have reduced

00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:43.550
sensitivity to variation, that
really improve the robustness,

00:27:43.550 --> 00:27:46.170
as well as meet
multiple objectives.

00:27:46.170 --> 00:27:48.860
So we'll do a little bit of
optimization-- multi-objective

00:27:48.860 --> 00:27:52.240
optimization coverage as well.

00:27:55.180 --> 00:27:58.440
So let's talk a little
bit about, what are the--

00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:05.220
oops-- what are the goals of
manufacturing process control

00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:06.540
and manufacturing processes?

00:28:06.540 --> 00:28:08.460
What are some of the
key characteristics you

00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:11.843
would have of a good process?

00:28:11.843 --> 00:28:13.260
What are the things
you would like

00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:15.960
to either minimize or optimize?

00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:21.200
So I already gave you
an advanced look at one.

00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:22.250
I'll throw out one.

00:28:22.250 --> 00:28:24.230
Of course, we're
very often interested

00:28:24.230 --> 00:28:28.190
in minimizing the
cost, and cost rises

00:28:28.190 --> 00:28:29.640
in a lot of different ways.

00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:31.400
What are some of the
ways that cost arise?

00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:34.897
There's the inherent
materials coming in.

00:28:34.897 --> 00:28:37.355
What are some of the other
costs associated with a process?

00:28:40.010 --> 00:28:41.960
Anybody-- Singapore as well--

00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:42.820
AUDIENCE: Labor.

00:28:42.820 --> 00:28:44.410
DUANE BONING: Labor, yeah.

00:28:44.410 --> 00:28:46.350
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
overhead, support.

00:28:46.350 --> 00:28:48.660
DUANE BONING: Overhead, support.

00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:49.710
AUDIENCE: Time.

00:28:49.710 --> 00:28:51.540
DUANE BONING: Time.

00:28:51.540 --> 00:28:53.490
Yeah, in fact time process--

00:28:53.490 --> 00:28:55.710
time is certainly
a characteristic

00:28:55.710 --> 00:28:57.480
that we might want
to optimize for.

00:28:57.480 --> 00:28:59.490
That would be a
typical characteristic.

00:28:59.490 --> 00:29:02.310
Cost has many of these flavors.

00:29:02.310 --> 00:29:03.670
Yes?

00:29:03.670 --> 00:29:04.980
AUDIENCE: Setup costs--

00:29:04.980 --> 00:29:06.840
DUANE BONING: Setup costs--

00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:12.420
so setup costs are
an interesting one.

00:29:12.420 --> 00:29:14.850
In various times,
we'll touch on some

00:29:14.850 --> 00:29:16.830
of these operational issues.

00:29:16.830 --> 00:29:19.950
Many of you have had
[? 2853. ?] We said--

00:29:19.950 --> 00:29:22.830
which was really about
manufacturing systems

00:29:22.830 --> 00:29:26.970
and things like
scheduling, throughput--

00:29:26.970 --> 00:29:28.870
those kinds of issues.

00:29:28.870 --> 00:29:32.590
And so time is a little
bit of that as well--

00:29:32.590 --> 00:29:36.110
not just the inherent
manufacturing,

00:29:36.110 --> 00:29:39.140
physical action on
the product time,

00:29:39.140 --> 00:29:42.650
but also transport time-- all
of these kinds of other issues.

00:29:42.650 --> 00:29:47.720
This subject will not be
dealing so much with logistics.

00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:50.180
It'll really be much
closer to the things

00:29:50.180 --> 00:29:53.400
that impact directly
the product itself.

00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:59.010
But certainly, setup time
can have an interaction--

00:29:59.010 --> 00:30:02.330
processes setup in general
can have a strong impact

00:30:02.330 --> 00:30:03.320
on processed quality.

00:30:06.550 --> 00:30:10.540
Very often, for example, in
semiconductor processing--

00:30:10.540 --> 00:30:13.870
maybe this will resonate
with your experiences

00:30:13.870 --> 00:30:15.190
in other processes--

00:30:15.190 --> 00:30:19.510
if we change substantially
the process setup

00:30:19.510 --> 00:30:22.320
in a particular
piece of equipment,

00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:25.440
the first few wafers will
behave very differently

00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:28.200
before the equipment
gets to a stable state.

00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:30.150
Sometimes we even
run dummy wafers

00:30:30.150 --> 00:30:32.370
in order to
equilibrate that setup.

00:30:32.370 --> 00:30:33.930
So setup is a good one.

00:30:33.930 --> 00:30:36.930
Some more-- what
are other things?

00:30:36.930 --> 00:30:37.760
I'm sorry--

00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:38.640
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:39.840
DUANE BONING: [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:41.610
Certainly.

00:30:41.610 --> 00:30:42.510
AUDIENCE: Equipment.

00:30:42.510 --> 00:30:44.550
DUANE BONING: Equipment, yep.

00:30:44.550 --> 00:30:48.120
We want to use the equipment
as efficiently as possible,

00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:49.200
and maintain it.

00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:51.720
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] a good
machine or a bad machine--

00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:54.180
DUANE BONING: Good machines
and bad machines-- absolutely.

00:30:54.180 --> 00:30:56.610
And in fact, probably
the first third

00:30:56.610 --> 00:30:59.790
of the class, the classic
statistical process control,

00:30:59.790 --> 00:31:02.610
will be all about detecting
whether the equipment is

00:31:02.610 --> 00:31:03.660
behaving as it should.

00:31:03.660 --> 00:31:08.425
Is it in a good state
or in a bad state?

00:31:08.425 --> 00:31:10.033
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:10.033 --> 00:31:11.950
DUANE BONING: So here
we had quality control--

00:31:11.950 --> 00:31:12.825
AUDIENCE: And rework.

00:31:12.825 --> 00:31:16.480
DUANE BONING:
--and rework, yeah.

00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:17.200
AUDIENCE: Energy.

00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:19.150
DUANE BONING: Energy, yeah.

00:31:19.150 --> 00:31:21.370
Yes, that's a good point.

00:31:21.370 --> 00:31:27.760
Actually, I think, dealing
with energy, as well

00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:32.230
as the consumption of materials
and the output of materials,

00:31:32.230 --> 00:31:33.940
is becoming a more
and more interesting

00:31:33.940 --> 00:31:37.760
aspect of manufacturing
processes.

00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:38.260
Let's see.

00:31:38.260 --> 00:31:38.760
When was it?

00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:43.360
Sunday night-- just to
share another anecdote--

00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:48.610
I was serving on a panel at a
big semiconductor conference.

00:31:48.610 --> 00:31:51.140
Actually, it's the
semiconductor--

00:31:51.140 --> 00:31:53.050
biggest circuit
design conference

00:31:53.050 --> 00:31:54.400
in the semiconductor industry.

00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:58.870
And I was on a panel all
about environmental or green

00:31:58.870 --> 00:32:00.130
manufacturing.

00:32:00.130 --> 00:32:03.340
And so the reduction
of energy usage

00:32:03.340 --> 00:32:07.690
is becoming a very big deal, as
well as the output of things--

00:32:07.690 --> 00:32:11.740
in semiconductor side, output
of global warming gases and so

00:32:11.740 --> 00:32:13.190
on-- the reduction of those.

00:32:13.190 --> 00:32:15.700
So that's a good point.

00:32:15.700 --> 00:32:20.020
By the way, I was on a panel
at 7:30 on Sunday evening.

00:32:23.060 --> 00:32:26.330
People here-- what
happened on Sunday?

00:32:26.330 --> 00:32:27.980
That was Super Bowl here.

00:32:27.980 --> 00:32:31.670
I was not very happy to
have to attend the panelist

00:32:31.670 --> 00:32:34.550
dinner the second half
of the Super Bowl,

00:32:34.550 --> 00:32:39.270
but as it turned out, I'm
very glad I missed it.

00:32:39.270 --> 00:32:42.590
OK, so we've hit some of
these other ideas here.

00:32:42.590 --> 00:32:44.840
Here's one that
nobody mentioned.

00:32:44.840 --> 00:32:50.180
Flexibility is also very key
in manufacturing processes

00:32:50.180 --> 00:32:50.750
as well.

00:32:50.750 --> 00:32:54.170
We're increasingly finding
that the same manufacturing

00:32:54.170 --> 00:32:57.650
line needs to be
adaptable rapidly

00:32:57.650 --> 00:33:03.510
to be able to deal with a bigger
product mix than ever before.

00:33:03.510 --> 00:33:06.570
So some of the focus
in this subject,

00:33:06.570 --> 00:33:09.830
again, is going to really be on
the processes, and variation,

00:33:09.830 --> 00:33:12.560
and quality in the processes.

00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:18.740
A little bit bigger emphasis is
going to be on unit processes.

00:33:18.740 --> 00:33:23.030
The entire aggregation of the
overall sequence of product

00:33:23.030 --> 00:33:25.040
to make the overall--

00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:28.460
or sequence of processes,
aggregation of the unit

00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:32.510
processes to make the entire
process line, and process flow,

00:33:32.510 --> 00:33:36.120
and the final
product is important.

00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:39.020
We'll touch on some of these
kinds of things of stack up

00:33:39.020 --> 00:33:42.470
of quality across
multiple processes,

00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:47.240
but we'll be-- end up
emphasizing developing

00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:51.230
techniques like statistical
process control, design

00:33:51.230 --> 00:33:54.740
of experiments and optimization,
with a little bit more

00:33:54.740 --> 00:33:58.910
of an emphasis on
the unit operations.

00:33:58.910 --> 00:34:05.350
Part of the reason is more and
more for really high-quality

00:34:05.350 --> 00:34:06.520
manufacturing--

00:34:06.520 --> 00:34:08.980
the recognition is
you can't simply

00:34:08.980 --> 00:34:12.550
inspect or hope to control at
the end of the overall process.

00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:18.040
You have to have every unit
process along the way running

00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:23.179
as effectively and at the
highest quality possible.

00:34:23.179 --> 00:34:25.900
So again, the
number one emphasis

00:34:25.900 --> 00:34:28.600
here is going to be
dealing with maximizing

00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:31.988
quality, conformance to
specifications, and so on.

00:34:31.988 --> 00:34:34.030
And some of these other
things that we've already

00:34:34.030 --> 00:34:35.440
talked about here--

00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:37.840
things like improving
throughput, improving

00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:40.600
flexibility, reducing cost--

00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:44.199
those are going to be secondary.

00:34:44.199 --> 00:34:47.020
There will be interactions
with some of these topics

00:34:47.020 --> 00:34:49.060
that you have run
into or might run

00:34:49.060 --> 00:34:51.190
into another in other subjects.

00:34:51.190 --> 00:34:57.060
And actually, a very
interesting area of research--

00:34:57.060 --> 00:34:59.970
in fact, an active area of
research of Stan Gershwin,

00:34:59.970 --> 00:35:02.550
who some of you had in 2853--

00:35:02.550 --> 00:35:06.450
is this interaction between
quality and quantity--

00:35:06.450 --> 00:35:09.570
that is, typical
operations and how

00:35:09.570 --> 00:35:15.390
you manage the sequencing
of parts through the line--

00:35:15.390 --> 00:35:19.800
the interaction between
throughput and quality--

00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:23.430
for example, dealing
with issues of setup,

00:35:23.430 --> 00:35:27.750
dealing with issues of slight
degradations in quality

00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:31.440
and how that might impact things
like scheduled maintenance

00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:33.060
or unscheduled maintenance.

00:35:33.060 --> 00:35:34.950
So it's a very
interesting topic.

00:35:34.950 --> 00:35:37.680
We'll occasionally, again,
overlap slightly with that,

00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:42.480
but our number one emphasis here
is dealing with the process,

00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:44.160
understanding and
modeling the process,

00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:47.770
and dealing with
quality and variation.

00:35:47.770 --> 00:35:52.000
So here's a few typical
process control problems.

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:53.880
I'll share a couple of these.

00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:57.240
And just to wake up
Dave, on the next slide,

00:35:57.240 --> 00:35:59.010
we'll let him say a
few words about some

00:35:59.010 --> 00:36:01.860
of the other examples.

00:36:01.860 --> 00:36:04.500
So here's a typical example.

00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:08.220
Probably, in fact, the
number one problem--

00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:12.090
or number one challenge in
semiconductor manufacturing

00:36:12.090 --> 00:36:15.570
is the minimum feature
size is very, very

00:36:15.570 --> 00:36:18.780
small-- becoming smaller with
each technology generation.

00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:21.090
The minimum feature
size is typically

00:36:21.090 --> 00:36:25.890
the channel length of an
individual MOS transistor.

00:36:25.890 --> 00:36:30.690
That's often the most critical
parameter, and it varies.

00:36:30.690 --> 00:36:32.940
With current
technology, we're down

00:36:32.940 --> 00:36:35.880
in heavy-duty manufacturing
at 90 nanometers.

00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:38.430
Some of the leading
edge manufacturers

00:36:38.430 --> 00:36:43.740
have gate or channel patterned
lengths of 65 nanometer.

00:36:43.740 --> 00:36:46.660
Occasionally, you'll hear
those terms thrown out.

00:36:46.660 --> 00:36:50.730
What that means is the minimum
feature size being patterned

00:36:50.730 --> 00:36:55.460
is about 65 nanometers wide.

00:36:55.460 --> 00:36:56.480
That's small.

00:36:56.480 --> 00:36:57.590
That's tiny.

00:36:57.590 --> 00:37:00.830
And as we continue to
scale, that variability

00:37:00.830 --> 00:37:07.400
in the width of that is becoming
tougher and tougher to achieve.

00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:13.550
So very often, there will be
challenges on the manufacturing

00:37:13.550 --> 00:37:16.070
line to detect--

00:37:16.070 --> 00:37:18.500
monitor, detect,
and then compensate

00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:20.030
for those kinds of variability.

00:37:22.820 --> 00:37:25.670
An emerging technology--
here's an interesting one

00:37:25.670 --> 00:37:28.020
that connects up
with, for example,

00:37:28.020 --> 00:37:31.190
some of the Singapore MIT
Alliance research efforts.

00:37:31.190 --> 00:37:36.960
A DNA diagnostic chip might
have uneven flow channels.

00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:41.960
So for example, here, these
are often microfluidic devices

00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:46.190
manufactured through
embossing processes, where

00:37:46.190 --> 00:37:48.770
one might be using
a polymer and trying

00:37:48.770 --> 00:37:52.730
to create channels that
might be 10 microns wide, 10

00:37:52.730 --> 00:37:54.080
microns deep--

00:37:54.080 --> 00:37:58.280
and maybe, in some places,
very, very narrow, for example,

00:37:58.280 --> 00:37:59.810
or very, very shallow--

00:37:59.810 --> 00:38:02.840
maybe 20 to 40 nanometers deep.

00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:05.480
I mention those because
those are actually

00:38:05.480 --> 00:38:09.440
real numbers for some
of the researchships

00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:15.720
that are being developed here at
MIT in electrical engineering,

00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:18.410
mechanical engineering, and
elsewhere-- very interesting

00:38:18.410 --> 00:38:22.040
properties, when one gets
down to that small dimension.

00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:23.630
And some of those
properties depend

00:38:23.630 --> 00:38:28.400
critically on those
dimensions, as you can imagine.

00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:31.220
So in fact, the
manufacturing process problem

00:38:31.220 --> 00:38:34.970
is, how do you
get processes that

00:38:34.970 --> 00:38:36.600
work in a controllable fashion?

00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:43.220
How do you inspect and
detect feature sizes,

00:38:43.220 --> 00:38:47.300
geometric parameters,
roughness of the geometry,

00:38:47.300 --> 00:38:51.950
as well as some other
material properties in order

00:38:51.950 --> 00:38:54.530
to achieve the
optimal functionality

00:38:54.530 --> 00:38:56.630
that one might need--

00:38:56.630 --> 00:39:03.250
for example, controlling the
flow of individual DNA from one

00:39:03.250 --> 00:39:08.890
place to another through these
incredibly tiny, tiny channels?

00:39:08.890 --> 00:39:10.630
What's another example?

00:39:10.630 --> 00:39:13.130
Somebody mentioned assembly.

00:39:13.130 --> 00:39:16.480
Assembly is a
manufacturing process,

00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:22.040
and the worst example of
this is that toys that come

00:39:22.040 --> 00:39:24.980
disassembled-- they
never fit, at least when

00:39:24.980 --> 00:39:29.180
I try to assemble them at home.

00:39:29.180 --> 00:39:36.350
Geometric fit and how those
imperfections can build up,

00:39:36.350 --> 00:39:37.430
even if--

00:39:37.430 --> 00:39:41.150
an interesting aspect--
even if a few parts

00:39:41.150 --> 00:39:44.600
are close to nominal when
you try to put them together,

00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:49.918
sometimes the aggregate
doesn't work out so well.

00:39:49.918 --> 00:39:51.460
And then there may
be other example--

00:39:51.460 --> 00:39:55.515
for example, very high-density
electrical connectors.

00:39:55.515 --> 00:39:57.940
And I think, Dave,
you had some example--

00:39:57.940 --> 00:39:59.503
this comes out of
an LFM thesis, or?

00:39:59.503 --> 00:40:00.920
DAVID HARDT: No,
this was actually

00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:03.690
research we did [INAUDIBLE]
a number of years ago.

00:40:03.690 --> 00:40:05.970
And it's actually just like--

00:40:05.970 --> 00:40:07.470
it's actually a
trend with all these

00:40:07.470 --> 00:40:11.333
that [INAUDIBLE] for years.

00:40:11.333 --> 00:40:13.420
Of course, [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:13.420 --> 00:40:17.490
DUANE BONING: Can you guys
in Singapore hear Dave?

00:40:17.490 --> 00:40:18.000
No?

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:19.208
AUDIENCE: No, we cannot hear.

00:40:19.208 --> 00:40:20.317
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:20.317 --> 00:40:24.120
DAVID HARDT: [INAUDIBLE]
mic's not working.

00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:28.200
Just because this
is sort of a theme--

00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:30.990
you can imagine electrical
connectors-- big heavy ones,

00:40:30.990 --> 00:40:34.560
like used in cars or in old
electronics back in the tube

00:40:34.560 --> 00:40:37.740
days, where you could grab hold
of some of these connectors

00:40:37.740 --> 00:40:38.940
with your hand--

00:40:38.940 --> 00:40:42.250
just the metal part itself.

00:40:42.250 --> 00:40:45.300
Now, as electronics has
become more and more dense,

00:40:45.300 --> 00:40:47.130
as things have become
smaller and smaller,

00:40:47.130 --> 00:40:50.310
the requirement for higher and
higher density of connectors--

00:40:50.310 --> 00:40:53.803
if not just to handle
these high-density chips,

00:40:53.803 --> 00:40:56.220
but just look at the back of
your computer-- some of those

00:40:56.220 --> 00:40:59.100
connectors there-- particularly
the interconnect type

00:40:59.100 --> 00:41:00.870
of connectors.

00:41:00.870 --> 00:41:02.460
Well, the industry
that made that

00:41:02.460 --> 00:41:06.090
made it the same way for
years, and it worked fine.

00:41:06.090 --> 00:41:10.860
And it's a great example of
how variability is actually

00:41:10.860 --> 00:41:12.340
a relative term.

00:41:12.340 --> 00:41:16.440
And so the variability
was relatively small.

00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:19.140
It was small relative to
the characteristic dimension

00:41:19.140 --> 00:41:20.100
that you needed.

00:41:20.100 --> 00:41:24.330
But as that shrunk down,
these major manufacturers

00:41:24.330 --> 00:41:26.100
found out that they
really couldn't

00:41:26.100 --> 00:41:28.373
use their old
technology to meet this.

00:41:28.373 --> 00:41:30.540
Of course, they went through
a lot of the procedures

00:41:30.540 --> 00:41:33.180
we're going to go through
and they improved things,

00:41:33.180 --> 00:41:34.920
but they couldn't
meet those dimensions,

00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:38.772
and had to make a
technology change as well.

00:41:38.772 --> 00:41:40.230
DUANE BONING: This
is my sneaky way

00:41:40.230 --> 00:41:42.900
to get an extra [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:45.660
DAVID HARDT: Also, on this
minimum feature size--

00:41:45.660 --> 00:41:47.370
and I'd ask Duane
to comment on this--

00:41:47.370 --> 00:41:51.210
I was once with a
gentleman from IBM Research

00:41:51.210 --> 00:41:53.280
who told me they were
just now-- this was maybe

00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:54.930
five, six years ago--
just now getting

00:41:54.930 --> 00:41:56.280
into some of the
advanced techniques

00:41:56.280 --> 00:41:58.860
that we're going to talk about
near the end of the term here.

00:41:58.860 --> 00:42:00.390
And I was a little
bit surprised,

00:42:00.390 --> 00:42:03.540
but then he pointed out,
back when the feature

00:42:03.540 --> 00:42:05.730
size on the chips was large--

00:42:05.730 --> 00:42:09.240
I don't know what large
was-- micron scale or several

00:42:09.240 --> 00:42:10.380
microns--

00:42:10.380 --> 00:42:14.340
the inherent variability
of the processes was fine--

00:42:14.340 --> 00:42:15.910
fine to manufacture
these things.

00:42:15.910 --> 00:42:17.850
But when you get down
to the nanometer range,

00:42:17.850 --> 00:42:22.120
all of a sudden, you have to
look at some other techniques.

00:42:22.120 --> 00:42:26.370
So there are these
timeless things,

00:42:26.370 --> 00:42:28.710
like toys that
don't fit together

00:42:28.710 --> 00:42:31.410
and other things related
to larger dimensions,

00:42:31.410 --> 00:42:34.470
but then this idea of the
ever-shrinking mechanical

00:42:34.470 --> 00:42:38.010
dimensions of things leads to
an ever-increasing importance

00:42:38.010 --> 00:42:40.683
of process control.

00:42:40.683 --> 00:42:41.850
So our future is guaranteed.

00:42:41.850 --> 00:42:44.220
DUANE BONING: I'll skip
ahead, because maybe [? not ?]

00:42:44.220 --> 00:42:47.250
going through all of these, but
if there's another one or two

00:42:47.250 --> 00:42:49.708
of these from your experience
that you wanted [INAUDIBLE]..

00:42:49.708 --> 00:42:54.930
DAVID HARDT: Well, these are
three large-scale issues.

00:42:54.930 --> 00:42:56.790
This is usually where
I ask if anybody here

00:42:56.790 --> 00:43:00.337
works for Boeing or any
other airframe manufacturer.

00:43:00.337 --> 00:43:01.920
DUANE BONING: We
have some automotive.

00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:03.180
We have some [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:03.180 --> 00:43:04.380
DAVID HARDT: Yeah.

00:43:04.380 --> 00:43:06.720
The automotive actually
does a lot better

00:43:06.720 --> 00:43:09.120
on variation control,
because they have--

00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:12.450
as you'll see, it helps
to have some volume

00:43:12.450 --> 00:43:15.330
and to be able to learn
and to get your processes

00:43:15.330 --> 00:43:16.320
in steady state.

00:43:16.320 --> 00:43:19.800
Things like airframes are
still sort of one-off.

00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:21.805
And because of the
large dimension there,

00:43:21.805 --> 00:43:24.180
it's really not an unpleasant--
it's not a pleasant thing

00:43:24.180 --> 00:43:27.443
to watch two halves of an
airplane being put together--

00:43:27.443 --> 00:43:29.860
although they've gotten a lot
better than they used to be.

00:43:29.860 --> 00:43:33.720
What was it they used to say--
that the number of thousands

00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:36.600
of pounds [INAUDIBLE]
flying in a 747?

00:43:36.600 --> 00:43:39.092
[INAUDIBLE] we're also
going to talk later--

00:43:39.092 --> 00:43:40.800
actually, I'm not sure
we will this term,

00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:43.200
but there's an
interesting LFM thesis

00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:45.708
done on these plastic throttle
bodies for fuel injection.

00:43:45.708 --> 00:43:47.250
This is a little
bit different issue.

00:43:47.250 --> 00:43:50.690
This was an entirely different
way of making a classical part.

00:43:50.690 --> 00:43:54.390
It had been made for
years out of aluminum--

00:43:54.390 --> 00:43:56.670
machined aluminum--
well-defined process,

00:43:56.670 --> 00:43:58.525
well-understood process control.

00:43:58.525 --> 00:44:00.150
Then, for good and
sufficient reasons--

00:44:00.150 --> 00:44:02.370
mainly weight and
production economy--

00:44:02.370 --> 00:44:05.220
they went to injection
molded parts,

00:44:05.220 --> 00:44:07.170
and variation became
a big problem.

00:44:07.170 --> 00:44:09.990
And how to get rid of
it was a-- was and still

00:44:09.990 --> 00:44:11.050
is an interesting issue.

00:44:11.050 --> 00:44:15.900
So a number of things come
up, often because of change--

00:44:15.900 --> 00:44:18.500
not always just because
of things being in stasis.

00:44:18.500 --> 00:44:19.500
DUANE BONING: Thank you.

00:44:24.120 --> 00:44:29.070
So again, some of
these points that Dave

00:44:29.070 --> 00:44:32.492
made about, for example, the
question or example you posed

00:44:32.492 --> 00:44:34.950
on semiconductor manufacturing
we'll talk a little bit more

00:44:34.950 --> 00:44:36.450
about on Thursday,
because it was

00:44:36.450 --> 00:44:38.130
a very interesting
transformation

00:44:38.130 --> 00:44:42.960
from defect-oriented problems
as the real yield and quality

00:44:42.960 --> 00:44:46.170
limiter to dimensional control.

00:44:46.170 --> 00:44:54.020
And essentially, parametric
variation is the killer now.

00:44:54.020 --> 00:44:56.760
OK, so one of the things--

00:44:56.760 --> 00:45:00.960
this connects up again also to
a point that Dave just made--

00:45:00.960 --> 00:45:05.820
is that there is an evolution
of manufacturing process control

00:45:05.820 --> 00:45:07.920
many industries
had gone through.

00:45:07.920 --> 00:45:10.710
And you will often
see a trajectory

00:45:10.710 --> 00:45:15.570
where an industry may actually
start with a process that

00:45:15.570 --> 00:45:18.270
is not all that stable,
and they essentially

00:45:18.270 --> 00:45:21.390
have to inspect every
single part that comes out--

00:45:21.390 --> 00:45:25.950
100% inspection may have
relatively high scrap rates--

00:45:25.950 --> 00:45:28.860
even a few percent,
for example--

00:45:28.860 --> 00:45:35.330
with low throughput, and
correspondingly high cost.

00:45:35.330 --> 00:45:38.300
So this might be thought
to be a characteristic

00:45:38.300 --> 00:45:43.430
of immature processes,
but it's also

00:45:43.430 --> 00:45:48.200
a characteristic of
incredibly complex processes.

00:45:48.200 --> 00:45:50.810
So you would really
like to avoid that.

00:45:50.810 --> 00:45:53.510
Quick question for-- well, some
of the guys from semiconductor

00:45:53.510 --> 00:45:54.590
know this.

00:45:54.590 --> 00:45:59.060
Do we have 100% inspection
of semiconductor chips today?

00:46:02.830 --> 00:46:04.412
What do you think?

00:46:04.412 --> 00:46:05.870
Do you think every
single chip that

00:46:05.870 --> 00:46:09.140
comes off the line gets
inspected, measured,

00:46:09.140 --> 00:46:10.910
verified that it produces?

00:46:10.910 --> 00:46:13.910
Do we have high costs or--

00:46:16.990 --> 00:46:20.060
somebody who knows the answer--

00:46:20.060 --> 00:46:23.800
well, I think perhaps it
depends on what the chip is.

00:46:23.800 --> 00:46:25.690
You think every
single microprocessor

00:46:25.690 --> 00:46:30.940
chip gets inspected before it
gets packaged and put in a PC?

00:46:30.940 --> 00:46:32.470
You bet.

00:46:32.470 --> 00:46:34.930
You bet.

00:46:34.930 --> 00:46:36.925
On the other hand--

00:46:36.925 --> 00:46:37.800
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:37.800 --> 00:46:39.425
DUANE BONING: Oh, absolutely.

00:46:46.322 --> 00:46:49.310
A microprocessor chip might sell
for a couple hundred dollars,

00:46:49.310 --> 00:46:50.550
so it's worth it.

00:46:50.550 --> 00:46:53.720
Now, if you're talking about
a semiconductor chip that

00:46:53.720 --> 00:46:57.770
is a discrete diode
worth probably

00:46:57.770 --> 00:47:01.160
a fraction of a penny in
terms of the manufacturing

00:47:01.160 --> 00:47:03.380
cost, yeah, you--

00:47:03.380 --> 00:47:06.560
it's a much more simple
and less complex thing,

00:47:06.560 --> 00:47:09.740
and you probably don't
need 100% inspection there.

00:47:09.740 --> 00:47:14.330
But most integrated circuits,
at the end of the day,

00:47:14.330 --> 00:47:16.630
still need inspection
at the end.

00:47:16.630 --> 00:47:17.436
Yeah, Hayden?

00:47:17.936 --> 00:47:19.686
HAYDEN TAYLOR: I thought
it might be worth

00:47:19.686 --> 00:47:21.465
remarking that I think--

00:47:21.465 --> 00:47:22.590
DUANE BONING: Speak loudly.

00:47:22.590 --> 00:47:25.610
AUDIENCE: Can everyone
hear me in Singapore?

00:47:25.610 --> 00:47:27.233
No.

00:47:27.233 --> 00:47:28.275
DUANE BONING: Just shout.

00:47:28.775 --> 00:47:29.610
HAYDEN TAYLOR: OK.

00:47:29.610 --> 00:47:33.060
I think Intel, when
they test their chips,

00:47:33.060 --> 00:47:36.480
they determine what
the maximum operating

00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:39.570
frequency of any given
chip is, and they sort them

00:47:39.570 --> 00:47:42.460
so the chips that happen to
operate at the faster end

00:47:42.460 --> 00:47:44.820
are put in more
expensive machines,

00:47:44.820 --> 00:47:47.580
and those that are slower
go in the cheaper machines.

00:47:47.580 --> 00:47:50.160
So they actually get
some extra benefit

00:47:50.160 --> 00:47:53.077
from the testing process.

00:47:53.077 --> 00:47:53.910
DUANE BONING: Right.

00:47:53.910 --> 00:47:56.340
So based on the quality
or the performance,

00:47:56.340 --> 00:48:01.000
they can bin the chips and
get differential pricing.

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:05.370
Of course, they would be most
beneficial if all of the chips

00:48:05.370 --> 00:48:07.200
operated at the high end.

00:48:07.200 --> 00:48:12.240
And so in some sense,
that's both a limitation

00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:14.040
and an advantage.

00:48:14.040 --> 00:48:17.970
You can get a premium for
the highest performing.

00:48:17.970 --> 00:48:22.560
But it's a great example
of the range of variation

00:48:22.560 --> 00:48:25.320
and the effective, ultimately,
on the end performance.

00:48:29.380 --> 00:48:32.140
A next step typically
in some of the evolution

00:48:32.140 --> 00:48:35.590
of these manufacturing
processes involve--

00:48:35.590 --> 00:48:40.900
whoops-- involve rework,
both at the end of the line,

00:48:40.900 --> 00:48:44.110
but more often pushing
down to unit processes--

00:48:44.110 --> 00:48:46.810
where, if you could
do a inspection,

00:48:46.810 --> 00:48:48.610
you still have limited
control perhaps

00:48:48.610 --> 00:48:50.500
over the individual
unit process,

00:48:50.500 --> 00:48:53.140
but you can inspect it,
determine something went wrong.

00:48:53.140 --> 00:48:56.170
And if there is a possibility
of fixing it then and there,

00:48:56.170 --> 00:48:59.710
now you've got a big advantage.

00:48:59.710 --> 00:49:03.460
We already talked about also
high durability at changeover,

00:49:03.460 --> 00:49:06.055
and that's an example
we already talked about,

00:49:06.055 --> 00:49:10.180
about how cost rate and
flexibility are linked.

00:49:10.180 --> 00:49:14.440
Of course, all of these--
if you can get quality up,

00:49:14.440 --> 00:49:17.020
get to higher and higher yield--

00:49:17.020 --> 00:49:20.620
that has a dramatic effect,
perhaps the strongest effect

00:49:20.620 --> 00:49:25.720
on overall throughput
and the optimal output

00:49:25.720 --> 00:49:27.520
from your manufacturing plant--

00:49:27.520 --> 00:49:30.580
especially in those industries
where yields may not

00:49:30.580 --> 00:49:33.700
be all that high.

00:49:33.700 --> 00:49:36.940
For example, in many of the
semiconductor processes,

00:49:36.940 --> 00:49:41.500
if you have 90% yield on a
very complex microprocessor,

00:49:41.500 --> 00:49:43.080
you're doing pretty well.

00:49:43.080 --> 00:49:44.930
That's not great, is it?

00:49:44.930 --> 00:49:50.950
Can you imagine 90% output of--

00:49:50.950 --> 00:49:56.580
90% functioning output
of syringe needles

00:49:56.580 --> 00:50:00.270
that we saw, where 10% of them
were defective in some way?

00:50:00.270 --> 00:50:02.400
That wouldn't be very
satisfying, I think.

00:50:04.930 --> 00:50:08.000
OK, so one of the
things that we're

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:11.420
going to do a little bit in
the next couple of lectures--

00:50:11.420 --> 00:50:13.910
and I'm going to talk about
a little bit generically

00:50:13.910 --> 00:50:17.240
to set the stage for that last
10 minutes or so of class--

00:50:17.240 --> 00:50:22.550
is characteristics of
manufacturing processes--

00:50:22.550 --> 00:50:25.520
in fact, something of
a taxonomy that Dave

00:50:25.520 --> 00:50:30.590
will cover on
Thursday based on some

00:50:30.590 --> 00:50:34.850
of the inherent characteristics
of the physical action

00:50:34.850 --> 00:50:37.460
of manufacturing processes.

00:50:37.460 --> 00:50:39.110
And we've already
chatted a little bit,

00:50:39.110 --> 00:50:42.680
and we'll see more as we
dive into those processes

00:50:42.680 --> 00:50:46.500
about why they don't
always work correctly.

00:50:46.500 --> 00:50:49.760
So here I'm going to try to get
a little bit of the terminology

00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:53.330
out and give you a little bit
of a framework for thinking

00:50:53.330 --> 00:50:56.240
about the processes,
and then some reflection

00:50:56.240 --> 00:50:59.720
on the different
segments of the subject

00:50:59.720 --> 00:51:03.290
that we mentioned are
coming up, and how

00:51:03.290 --> 00:51:08.910
they relate to a very-high level
generic view of the process.

00:51:08.910 --> 00:51:10.860
So the key idea in a
process, of course,

00:51:10.860 --> 00:51:15.830
is that we have some part that
we want to produce at the end.

00:51:15.830 --> 00:51:18.680
We do that by working
on a work piece.

00:51:18.680 --> 00:51:22.970
There is some physical material
that we are transforming

00:51:22.970 --> 00:51:25.100
in some important way.

00:51:25.100 --> 00:51:26.930
We are changing the geometry.

00:51:26.930 --> 00:51:30.950
We are changing the material
properties of that part.

00:51:30.950 --> 00:51:32.250
How do we do that?

00:51:32.250 --> 00:51:35.520
Well, we have to
subjected to some process,

00:51:35.520 --> 00:51:42.040
and we do that through
equipment, and in some cases,

00:51:42.040 --> 00:51:43.600
parts of the
equipment-- things like

00:51:43.600 --> 00:51:48.310
tooling that come in
contact with the part.

00:51:48.310 --> 00:51:53.170
So some examples of broadly,
equipment-- and here,

00:51:53.170 --> 00:51:55.960
equipment we may even
rise a little bit

00:51:55.960 --> 00:52:01.990
as both the physical machinery
and the process environment

00:52:01.990 --> 00:52:05.620
that that machinery generates
around the work piece.

00:52:05.620 --> 00:52:08.810
So examples might
be an an etch bath.

00:52:08.810 --> 00:52:13.460
So that is a liquid
chemical environment

00:52:13.460 --> 00:52:15.080
that might be done
under the control

00:52:15.080 --> 00:52:18.870
of a piece of equipment.

00:52:18.870 --> 00:52:21.930
Other equipment that many of you
may have come in contact with--

00:52:21.930 --> 00:52:26.490
things like injection molders,
lathes, drop presses--

00:52:26.490 --> 00:52:30.060
and the whole goal of those
are to act on some workpiece.

00:52:30.060 --> 00:52:33.300
So we may have silicon with
certain layers already coded

00:52:33.300 --> 00:52:34.020
on them.

00:52:34.020 --> 00:52:36.990
We may have feedstock,
things like plastic pellets

00:52:36.990 --> 00:52:39.120
or [INAUDIBLE], that come in.

00:52:39.120 --> 00:52:40.260
We may have sheet metal.

00:52:40.260 --> 00:52:41.970
Sheet metal already
may have gone

00:52:41.970 --> 00:52:44.040
through an awful
lot of processing,

00:52:44.040 --> 00:52:46.080
and we're looking at
a unit step that's

00:52:46.080 --> 00:52:49.810
doing some additional
processing on that.

00:52:49.810 --> 00:52:55.560
And then the output can
either be a finished part

00:52:55.560 --> 00:53:00.090
direct for use or a part that is
in some intermediate stage that

00:53:00.090 --> 00:53:03.630
will, again, go and be used
in some larger manufacturing

00:53:03.630 --> 00:53:04.540
process.

00:53:04.540 --> 00:53:06.420
So it might be a shaft
or a hood or something

00:53:06.420 --> 00:53:08.940
like that that's going
to be further assembled,

00:53:08.940 --> 00:53:10.440
or an IC chip--

00:53:10.440 --> 00:53:12.750
which, from the
semiconductor fab,

00:53:12.750 --> 00:53:14.400
that's the finished product.

00:53:14.400 --> 00:53:17.130
But from somebody-- can't
remember who said they worked

00:53:17.130 --> 00:53:19.080
at Dell--

00:53:19.080 --> 00:53:22.470
the IC chip-- that's
not a finished product.

00:53:22.470 --> 00:53:25.680
The PC and the assembly--

00:53:25.680 --> 00:53:28.390
the packaging and assembly
onto boards and the assembly

00:53:28.390 --> 00:53:31.920
of boards into the
[? back plane ?] and so on

00:53:31.920 --> 00:53:35.980
are an important
manufacturing process.

00:53:35.980 --> 00:53:40.560
So by definition, we're thinking
of a manufacturing process

00:53:40.560 --> 00:53:45.240
as a change or the sequence
of changes in some work piece

00:53:45.240 --> 00:53:46.510
material.

00:53:46.510 --> 00:53:48.390
The easiest way to
conceptualize this

00:53:48.390 --> 00:53:51.180
is that it's going to
be a change in geometry.

00:53:51.180 --> 00:53:53.610
We're building up some part.

00:53:53.610 --> 00:53:56.790
But equally
important is a change

00:53:56.790 --> 00:54:00.810
in some material properties,
some constitutive properties

00:54:00.810 --> 00:54:02.410
of that structure.

00:54:02.410 --> 00:54:04.410
We'll see lots of
examples of that

00:54:04.410 --> 00:54:06.540
in semiconductor fabrication.

00:54:06.540 --> 00:54:09.750
Here I want to give you a
kind of a generic conceptual

00:54:09.750 --> 00:54:11.580
semiconductor process model.

00:54:11.580 --> 00:54:13.710
And actually, I want to
mention a little bit--

00:54:13.710 --> 00:54:17.520
this ties into the history of
the evolution of this subject.

00:54:17.520 --> 00:54:21.420
Back-- oh, God-- it's getting
to be 18 years ago already--

00:54:24.060 --> 00:54:27.540
when we were starting to look
at ways to formalize discussion

00:54:27.540 --> 00:54:31.200
of semiconductor processing,
we came up with--

00:54:31.200 --> 00:54:34.140
myself and some other
co-workers here at MIT

00:54:34.140 --> 00:54:37.080
came up with some terminology
for this conceptual

00:54:37.080 --> 00:54:39.000
semiconductor process model.

00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:41.280
And we talked about
it in terms of states

00:54:41.280 --> 00:54:43.830
and transformations of
states, these states

00:54:43.830 --> 00:54:47.610
being the geometric state and
the constitutive properties

00:54:47.610 --> 00:54:51.300
of the work piece In
semiconductor fabrication,

00:54:51.300 --> 00:54:53.760
that's typically the wafer.

00:54:53.760 --> 00:54:56.010
And around that,
one is generating

00:54:56.010 --> 00:54:59.040
a process or some
environment around the wafer.

00:54:59.040 --> 00:55:03.060
That may be gases,
temperature environment,

00:55:03.060 --> 00:55:09.300
other kinds of ways of
generating and directing

00:55:09.300 --> 00:55:13.750
energy and material at
the surface of the wafer.

00:55:13.750 --> 00:55:17.500
The machine itself is a key
controlling parameter for how

00:55:17.500 --> 00:55:20.920
one generates that environment,
and the rest of the facility

00:55:20.920 --> 00:55:25.390
also impacts that environment--
the feed material coming in,

00:55:25.390 --> 00:55:29.560
the very, very high purity
chemicals, for example.

00:55:29.560 --> 00:55:31.480
Now, what's important
about the machine

00:55:31.480 --> 00:55:35.980
is that the operator
only has limited access.

00:55:35.980 --> 00:55:39.700
The operator, which may be human
or may be an automation system,

00:55:39.700 --> 00:55:44.860
has only limited access to
that equipment and the facility

00:55:44.860 --> 00:55:48.860
through some settings-- some
knob settings, if you will,

00:55:48.860 --> 00:55:51.370
that you can perform
on the equipment.

00:55:51.370 --> 00:55:56.080
But you also have other
directional sensing capability.

00:55:56.080 --> 00:55:59.650
You have some number of readings
that are telling you indirectly

00:55:59.650 --> 00:56:01.930
things about the machine--

00:56:01.930 --> 00:56:05.440
machine states, sensor
states, thermocouple states,

00:56:05.440 --> 00:56:08.260
which are telling you things
about the wafer environment--

00:56:08.260 --> 00:56:11.110
and then, indirectly--
if you're lucky, directly

00:56:11.110 --> 00:56:12.985
things about the
state of the work

00:56:12.985 --> 00:56:18.190
piece itself, telling you things
like the thickness of the film

00:56:18.190 --> 00:56:20.230
being grown on the wafer.

00:56:20.230 --> 00:56:24.220
And then we had a term,
which is really kind

00:56:24.220 --> 00:56:28.120
generic to semiconductor
processing, of a recipe that

00:56:28.120 --> 00:56:32.980
basically defined the settings,
and perhaps even could

00:56:32.980 --> 00:56:35.203
be generalized to a
control algorithm,

00:56:35.203 --> 00:56:37.120
if you will-- which might
be a little bit more

00:56:37.120 --> 00:56:40.570
of a generic
terminology-- for dealing

00:56:40.570 --> 00:56:42.880
with responses to the readings.

00:56:42.880 --> 00:56:46.180
So now you can think about
things like real-time control--

00:56:46.180 --> 00:56:48.940
or run by run control, which
we'll talk about later--

00:56:48.940 --> 00:56:52.390
that looks at how one determines
what the settings should

00:56:52.390 --> 00:56:55.180
be on the equipment.

00:56:55.180 --> 00:56:59.050
Now, we came up with a
slightly simplified version

00:56:59.050 --> 00:57:01.930
of the semiconductor
process model just focused

00:57:01.930 --> 00:57:05.590
on the wafer, the
process, and the settings.

00:57:05.590 --> 00:57:10.352
And I want to give you a
real quick example of this.

00:57:10.352 --> 00:57:12.310
Actually, I'll probably
skip this and come back

00:57:12.310 --> 00:57:13.880
to this next time.

00:57:13.880 --> 00:57:18.700
This is looking at examples for
one particular process dealing

00:57:18.700 --> 00:57:20.420
with oxidation.

00:57:20.420 --> 00:57:22.360
Now, what was
interesting is we came up

00:57:22.360 --> 00:57:24.110
with this generic process model.

00:57:24.110 --> 00:57:26.350
This was early '90s.

00:57:26.350 --> 00:57:28.390
When I came back to
MIT, I started teaching

00:57:28.390 --> 00:57:31.330
a subject on
semiconductor process

00:57:31.330 --> 00:57:34.420
control dealing with
statistical process modeling,

00:57:34.420 --> 00:57:37.810
yield, design of
experiments, and so on.

00:57:37.810 --> 00:57:39.640
And then I got involved
in some research

00:57:39.640 --> 00:57:42.370
that overlapped with Dave
Hardt and some others.

00:57:42.370 --> 00:57:45.610
And he had a course, and--

00:57:45.610 --> 00:57:47.890
on manufacturing
process control,

00:57:47.890 --> 00:57:52.990
and he had a process model
for control circa 1995.

00:57:52.990 --> 00:57:55.780
Maybe you had come up
with it even earlier.

00:57:55.780 --> 00:57:59.470
And one of the readings that you
need to grab off of the website

00:57:59.470 --> 00:58:03.580
is an overview of
manufacturing processes that

00:58:03.580 --> 00:58:08.020
is circa 1995, '96, where
the terminology is almost

00:58:08.020 --> 00:58:10.430
exactly the same.

00:58:10.430 --> 00:58:14.290
And in fact, the
overlap was astonishing.

00:58:14.290 --> 00:58:16.810
The tools and techniques
that I was teaching

00:58:16.810 --> 00:58:19.600
in my separate subject and Dave
was teaching in his subject

00:58:19.600 --> 00:58:23.350
was about 80% the same, and
then just the process details

00:58:23.350 --> 00:58:24.670
kind of changed.

00:58:24.670 --> 00:58:26.950
So in fact, we
merged the subject,

00:58:26.950 --> 00:58:30.520
and that's how this
subject came about.

00:58:30.520 --> 00:58:34.120
And again, the key ideas
here are there are controls.

00:58:34.120 --> 00:58:36.130
There is the operator,
and some settings,

00:58:36.130 --> 00:58:38.320
and the equipment, material--

00:58:38.320 --> 00:58:41.170
that we're all about changing
the geometry and property

00:58:41.170 --> 00:58:44.680
through the action of
the process environment,

00:58:44.680 --> 00:58:46.457
or these energy states.

00:58:46.457 --> 00:58:48.040
Now, in this class,
we're really going

00:58:48.040 --> 00:58:50.770
to be focused a lot
on the overall process

00:58:50.770 --> 00:58:53.500
outputs [INAUDIBLE]
processes, and in some cases,

00:58:53.500 --> 00:58:55.790
the aggregation of those.

00:58:55.790 --> 00:58:58.240
And just to get a little
bit of terminology

00:58:58.240 --> 00:59:03.700
as a prelude for both
Thursday and next Tuesday,

00:59:03.700 --> 00:59:07.570
one can think about a
vector y of characteristics

00:59:07.570 --> 00:59:10.000
of the product that
are important--

00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:13.000
shape parameters,
particular thicknesses,

00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:16.150
perhaps material properties--
like index of refraction

00:59:16.150 --> 00:59:17.710
of thin films--

00:59:17.710 --> 00:59:22.630
the conductivity of particular
layers, as well as transistor

00:59:22.630 --> 00:59:24.920
characteristics, for example.

00:59:24.920 --> 00:59:28.900
And that is a function of
the process parameters,

00:59:28.900 --> 00:59:31.840
both controls that
one can change

00:59:31.840 --> 00:59:37.040
and other parameters that may be
fixed and set for the process.

00:59:37.040 --> 00:59:39.610
So a key question is,
what are these alphas?

00:59:39.610 --> 00:59:41.350
What are these
process parameters?

00:59:44.990 --> 00:59:46.880
And how do we go about
controlling those?

00:59:46.880 --> 00:59:51.660
So we'll touch on this picture
a little bit more next time,

00:59:51.660 --> 00:59:56.990
but what I want to
skip to here is a--

00:59:56.990 --> 01:00:01.550
we'll hear about these different
characterizations or taxonomy

01:00:01.550 --> 01:00:02.810
of the process next time.

01:00:05.570 --> 01:00:08.900
I want to give you
one last description

01:00:08.900 --> 01:00:15.590
building on this very simplified
mathematical terminology

01:00:15.590 --> 01:00:23.510
at least for the process,
which is we can go in and--

01:00:23.510 --> 01:00:24.750
here we go.

01:00:24.750 --> 01:00:25.580
Here we go.

01:00:25.580 --> 01:00:28.970
We can split out some of
those process parameters

01:00:28.970 --> 01:00:32.420
as those things that
we have control over

01:00:32.420 --> 01:00:34.940
as inputs to the process.

01:00:34.940 --> 01:00:39.560
And now, if we do just a very,
very simple first-order Taylor

01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:43.230
expansion, we get
some nice insight

01:00:43.230 --> 01:00:47.650
into where variation comes
in a typical process.

01:00:47.650 --> 01:00:52.070
So this is the very
simple variation equation

01:00:52.070 --> 01:00:53.600
that, in some sense,
helps structure

01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:56.270
what we're going to be doing
through the rest of the term.

01:00:56.270 --> 01:01:00.320
One can think about
deviations in the output

01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:03.950
deltas in those
characteristics, and we

01:01:03.950 --> 01:01:07.100
can expand that in terms of
some of the alpha parameters

01:01:07.100 --> 01:01:11.300
and some of the
controllable parameters.

01:01:11.300 --> 01:01:18.670
So this dy d alpha-- that's
sensitivity to delta a alphas.

01:01:18.670 --> 01:01:19.600
What's delta alphas?

01:01:19.600 --> 01:01:23.780
Those are disturbances that you
would prefer were not there.

01:01:23.780 --> 01:01:26.320
They're not things that you
intentionally are changing.

01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:30.320
Those are inherent
disturbances in the process.

01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:34.300
So there's one component
that deals with disturbances.

01:01:34.300 --> 01:01:36.670
And then there's also
intentional changes

01:01:36.670 --> 01:01:41.020
we might have, when we want to
or intentionally make a change

01:01:41.020 --> 01:01:43.190
to the control inputs.

01:01:43.190 --> 01:01:47.030
And so what's interesting is
the strategies that we might use

01:01:47.030 --> 01:01:51.070
for minimizing this delta y.

01:01:51.070 --> 01:01:54.280
And in some sense--

01:01:54.280 --> 01:01:57.470
let's see.

01:01:57.470 --> 01:02:00.470
Let me get to a
nice summary here.

01:02:00.470 --> 01:02:01.730
Here we go.

01:02:01.730 --> 01:02:06.350
In some sense, the goal of
the first third of the class--

01:02:06.350 --> 01:02:09.170
the techniques we'll be talking
about our statistical process

01:02:09.170 --> 01:02:12.530
control, which is
all about detecting

01:02:12.530 --> 01:02:15.920
these inherent deviations,
these disturbances,

01:02:15.920 --> 01:02:18.770
and seeking to minimize them.

01:02:18.770 --> 01:02:21.410
Then we can talk about
process optimization,

01:02:21.410 --> 01:02:23.510
things like design
of experiments,

01:02:23.510 --> 01:02:26.810
where we're basically trying
to build a model for y--

01:02:26.810 --> 01:02:29.240
the output-- as a
function of process

01:02:29.240 --> 01:02:33.560
parameters, and seek to
minimize the sensitivity

01:02:33.560 --> 01:02:37.610
to those disturbances, to
have as robust a process as

01:02:37.610 --> 01:02:39.020
possible.

01:02:39.020 --> 01:02:41.180
And then finally,
we can also think

01:02:41.180 --> 01:02:45.590
about active modes of process
control, where you actually

01:02:45.590 --> 01:02:48.500
manipulate some of the
control parameters,

01:02:48.500 --> 01:02:51.830
perhaps in response to
observed deviations,

01:02:51.830 --> 01:02:55.280
to ultimately minimize
or counteract,

01:02:55.280 --> 01:02:59.600
through feedback control, the
effects of those disturbances.

01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:03.560
So that in the
nutshell is the map

01:03:03.560 --> 01:03:06.740
for what we're going to be doing
through the rest of the term.

01:03:06.740 --> 01:03:09.920
We're going to be dealing, first
off, with statistical process

01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:12.380
control and the statistical
background for that.

01:03:12.380 --> 01:03:14.270
We're then going to be
modeling the process,

01:03:14.270 --> 01:03:17.270
building up design of
experiments, response surface

01:03:17.270 --> 01:03:20.420
modeling technologies
for modeling

01:03:20.420 --> 01:03:22.580
and optimizing the
process, and then

01:03:22.580 --> 01:03:25.460
thirdly, we'll talk about
some basic strategies

01:03:25.460 --> 01:03:28.970
for feedback control
to compensate

01:03:28.970 --> 01:03:31.370
for some of these processes.

01:03:31.370 --> 01:03:34.060
So with that, we'll leave you.

01:03:34.060 --> 01:03:37.030
Folks in Singapore, we'll
see you again next week.

01:03:37.030 --> 01:03:44.570
Again, do catch the videotape
of Thursday's lecture.

01:03:44.570 --> 01:03:46.790
Please go to the website.

01:03:46.790 --> 01:03:50.840
This lecture is on there,
but also there are two--

01:03:50.840 --> 01:03:54.020
well, there's one reading
that you should grab

01:03:54.020 --> 01:03:55.670
right away, which is about a--

01:03:55.670 --> 01:03:59.150
was is it-- six or seven
pages process overview

01:03:59.150 --> 01:04:03.500
which defines some of this
terminology in written form

01:04:03.500 --> 01:04:05.180
that we've talked about here.

01:04:05.180 --> 01:04:07.940
And I will also post what
the reading assignment

01:04:07.940 --> 01:04:10.330
is that you can get started on.

01:04:10.330 --> 01:04:12.290
I don't think it's
posted up there yet,

01:04:12.290 --> 01:04:14.300
but go out and try
to get these books,

01:04:14.300 --> 01:04:17.870
because there will be-- the
reading assignment is basically

01:04:17.870 --> 01:04:21.380
start on the first two chapters,
which are very talkative

01:04:21.380 --> 01:04:24.900
overview of
manufacturing processes.

01:04:24.900 --> 01:04:26.840
So we'll get you
started on those.

01:04:26.840 --> 01:04:28.340
One quick question, Dave--

01:04:28.340 --> 01:04:30.020
is there any information on--

01:04:30.020 --> 01:04:33.088
is there a pro seminar
when that starts up,

01:04:33.088 --> 01:04:34.130
that you want to mention?

01:04:34.130 --> 01:04:34.880
DAVID HARDT: Yeah.

01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:37.130
2.888 is already-- there's
a Stellar site on it.

01:04:37.130 --> 01:04:40.616
I think I've sent most of the
preregistered students notes

01:04:40.616 --> 01:04:44.712
on this, but it starts
a week [INAUDIBLE]..

01:04:44.712 --> 01:04:45.420
DUANE BONING: OK.

01:04:45.420 --> 01:04:47.310
So we'll have more
information on that.

01:04:47.310 --> 01:04:52.680
Many of you, like those enrolled
in the mechanical engineering,

01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:54.850
MEng program, will know
about this already,

01:04:54.850 --> 01:04:58.680
but this series of seminars from
folks from industry and so on

01:04:58.680 --> 01:05:02.930
will quite likely be of interest
to other people in the class.

01:05:02.930 --> 01:05:06.720
So we'll start alerting you
about those evening seminars

01:05:06.720 --> 01:05:09.130
here as well.

01:05:09.130 --> 01:05:13.310
So welcome to the class, and
we'll see you on Thursday.

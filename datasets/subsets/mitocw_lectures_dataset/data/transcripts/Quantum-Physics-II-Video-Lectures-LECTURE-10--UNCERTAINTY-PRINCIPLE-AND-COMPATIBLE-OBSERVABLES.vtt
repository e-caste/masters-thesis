00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.300
PROFESSOR: OK, last time we
were talking about uncertainty.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.590
We gave a picture
for uncertainty--

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:34.320
it was a neat picture, I
think of the uncertainty,

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:40.200
refer to the uncertainty
measuring an operator

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.540
A that was a Hermitian operator.

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.360
And that uncertainty
depended on the state

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.550
that you were measuring.

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.590
If the state was
an eigenstate of A,

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.320
there would be no uncertainty.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.300
If the state is not
an eigenstate of A,

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.680
there was an uncertainty.

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.640
And this uncertainty
was defined as the norm

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:10.390
of A minus the expectation
value of A acting on psi.

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.330
So that was our
definition of uncertainty.

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.790
And it had nice properties.

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.540
In fact, it was zero if
and only if the state was

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.400
an eigenstate of the operator.

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.710
We proved a couple
of things as well--

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.880
that, in particular, one
that is kind of practical

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:43.010
is that delta A of psi
squared is the expectation

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:48.290
value of A squared on the
state psi minus the expectation

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:52.055
value of A on the
state psi squared.

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:01.590
So that was also proven,
which, since this number is

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:07.130
greater than or equal to 0, this
is greater than or equal to 0.

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.460
And in particular, the
expectation value of A squared

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:15.686
is bigger than the
expectation of A squared.

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.740
So let's do a trivial
example for a computation.

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:30.750
Suppose somebody tells
you in an example

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:36.010
that the spin is in
an eigenstate of Sz.

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:45.470
So the state psi it's what we
called the plus state, or the z

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.890
plus state.

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:56.125
And you want to know what
is uncertainty delta of Sx.

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.220
So you know if you're
in an eigenstate of z,

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.650
you are not in an
eigenstate of x-- in fact,

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:13.870
you're in a superposition
of two eigenstates of Sx.

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.250
Therefore, there should
be some uncertainty here.

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.760
And the question is, what is
the quickest way in which you

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:25.080
compute this uncertainty,
and how much is it?

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:30.280
So many times, the simplest way
is to just use this formula.

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:40.200
So let's do that.

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:48.990
So what is the expectation
value of Sx in that state?

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:53.510
So it's Sx expectation
value would

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:57.530
be given by Sx on this thing.

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:03.290
Now, actually, it's
relatively clear

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:08.070
to see that this expectation
value is going to be 0,

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:14.180
because Sx really
in the state plus

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:18.480
is equal amplitude to be
Sx equal plus h bar over 2,

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:20.740
or minus h bar over 2.

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:24.340
But suppose you
don't remember that.

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:26.790
In order to compute
this, it may come

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:32.720
handy to recall the matrix
presentation of Sx, which

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.280
you don't need to know by heart.

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:41.190
So this state plus
is the first state,

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:44.780
and the basis state
is the state 1 0.

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:51.960
And then we have Sx on plus
is equal to h bar over 2 0

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.440
1 1 0, acting on 1 0.

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:00.880
Zero and that's equal
to h bar over 2.

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:05.810
The first thing gives you 0,
and the second one gives you 1.

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:10.090
So that's, in fact, equal to h
bar over 2, the state of minus.

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:18.990
So here you go to h
bar over 2 plus minus,

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:26.470
and you know plus and minus are
orthogonal, so 0 is expected.

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:28.550
Well, are we going to
get zero uncertainty?

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:33.660
No, because Sx
squared, however, does

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:35.540
have some expectation value.

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:38.313
So what is the expectation
value of Sx squared?

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:45.650
Well, there's an advantage here.

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:50.640
You may remember that this
Sx squared is a funny matrix.

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:54.110
It's a multiple of the
identity, because if you square

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:56.810
this matrix, you get the
multiple of the identity.

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:02.780
So Sx squared is h over 2
squared times the identity

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:07.740
matrix-- the two by
two identity matrix.

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:10.620
So the expectation
value of Sx squared

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:15.340
is h bar over 2 squared
times expectation value

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:17.832
of the identity.

00:06:17.832 --> 00:06:20.450
And on any state,
the expectation value

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:23.350
on any normalized state,
the expectation value

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:26.770
of the identity
will be equal to 1.

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:31.210
So this is just h
squared over 2 squared.

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:37.310
So back to our uncertainty,
delta Sx squared

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:41.350
would be equal to the
expectation value of Sx squared

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:44.800
minus the expectation
value of Sx squared.

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:46.720
This was 0.

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:52.990
This thing was equal to
h bar over 2 squared,

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:58.450
and therefore, delta Sx
is equal to h bar over 2.

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:11.500
So just I wanted to make
you familiar with that.

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:14.840
You can compute these
things-- these norms and all

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:20.770
these equations are pretty
practical, and easy to use.

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:24.600
So today what we have
to do is the following--

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:28.740
we're going to establish
the uncertainty principle.

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:31.390
We're going to just prove it.

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:35.930
And then, once we have
the uncertainty principle,

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:40.670
we'll try to find some
applications for it.

00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:43.610
So before doing
an application, we

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:47.130
will discuss the case of
the energy time uncertainty

00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:51.530
principle, which is
slightly more subtle

00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:55.310
and has interestingly
connotations that we

00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:56.480
will develop today.

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:59.650
And finally, we'll use
the uncertainty principle

00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:04.970
to learn how to find bounds
for energies of ground states.

00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:08.400
So we might make a rigorous
application of the uncertainty

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:10.090
principle.

00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:16.410
So the uncertainty principle
talks about two operators

00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:21.870
that are both
Hermitian, and states

00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:32.070
the following-- so given
the theorem, or uncertainty

00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:47.610
principle, given two
Hermitian operators A and B,

00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:59.970
and a state psi normalized, then
the following inequality holds.

00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:03.950
And we're going to write it in
one way, then in another way.

00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:12.910
Delta A psi squared times
delta B-- sometimes people

00:09:12.910 --> 00:09:15.870
in order to avoid cluttering
don't put the psi.

00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:17.910
I don't know whether
to put it or not.

00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:21.130
It does look a little more
messy with the psi there,

00:09:21.130 --> 00:09:24.420
but it's something you
have to keep in mind.

00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:26.940
Each time you have
an uncertainty,

00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:29.550
you are talking about
some specific state

00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:31.380
that should not be forgotten.

00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:35.940
So maybe I'll erase it to
make it look a little nicer.

00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:41.140
Delta B squared-- now
it's an inequality.

00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:44.260
So not just equality,
but inequality.

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:48.270
That product of uncertainties
must exceed a number--

00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:52.410
a computable number-- which is
given by the following thing.

00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:04.695
OK, so here it is.

00:10:07.530 --> 00:10:11.220
This is a number, is
the expectation value

00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:17.236
of this strange operator
in the state psi squared.

00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:27.490
So even such a statement is
somewhat quite confusing,

00:10:27.490 --> 00:10:34.690
because you wish to know
what kind of number is this.

00:10:34.690 --> 00:10:36.430
Could this be a complex number?

00:10:36.430 --> 00:10:42.320
If it were a complex
number, why am I squaring?

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:44.870
That doesn't make any sense.

00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:47.720
Inequalities-- these
are real numbers.

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:50.550
Deltas are defined
to be real numbers.

00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:52.010
They're the norms.

00:10:52.010 --> 00:10:55.020
So this is real positive.

00:10:55.020 --> 00:11:00.260
This would make no sense if
this would be a complex number.

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:03.410
So this number better be real.

00:11:03.410 --> 00:11:06.200
And the way it's
written, it seems

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:08.490
to be particularly
confusing, because there

00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:10.660
seems to be an i here.

00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:16.530
So at first sight, you might
say, well, can it be real?

00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:19.060
But the thing that you
should really focus here

00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:20.930
is this whole thing.

00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:22.115
This is some operator.

00:11:27.010 --> 00:11:32.890
And against all first
impressions, this operator

00:11:32.890 --> 00:11:37.700
formed by taking the
commutator of A and B--

00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:40.850
this is the
commutator A B minus B

00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:46.580
A-- is Hermitian,
because, in fact,

00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:50.640
if you have two
operators, and you take

00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:54.880
the commutator, if the
two of them are Hermitian,

00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:58.080
the answer is not Hermitian.

00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:04.850
And that you know already--
x with p is equal to i h bar.

00:12:04.850 --> 00:12:09.500
These are Hermitian operators,
and suddenly the commutator

00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:11.630
is not a Hermitian operator.

00:12:11.630 --> 00:12:13.050
You have the unit here.

00:12:13.050 --> 00:12:16.090
A Hermitian operator
with a number

00:12:16.090 --> 00:12:18.210
here would have to
be a real things.

00:12:18.210 --> 00:12:21.380
So there's an extra i,
that's your first hint

00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:22.905
that this i is important.

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:31.450
So the fact is that
this operator as defind

00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:40.980
here is Hermitian, because
if you take 1 over i A B--

00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:46.980
and we're going to try to
take its Hermitian conjugate--

00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:54.790
we have 1 over i A B
minus B A. And we're

00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:57.320
taking the Hermitian conjugate.

00:12:57.320 --> 00:13:01.940
Now, the i is going to
get complex conjugated,

00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:05.930
so you're going to
get 1 over minus i.

00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:09.810
The Hermitian
conjugate of a product

00:13:09.810 --> 00:13:12.850
is the Hermitian conjugate
in opposite order.

00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:19.065
So it would be B dagger A
dagger minus A dagger B dagger.

00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:26.950
And of course, these
operators are Hermitian,

00:13:26.950 --> 00:13:33.600
so 1 over minus i
is minus 1 over i.

00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:40.450
And here I get B A minus
A B. So with a minus sign,

00:13:40.450 --> 00:13:44.310
this is 1 over i A B again.

00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:52.720
So the operator is equal to
its dagger-- its adjoint.

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:55.170
And therefore, this
operator is Hermitian.

00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:06.850
And as we proved,
the expectation value

00:14:06.850 --> 00:14:12.920
of any Hermitian
operator is real.

00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:15.500
And we're in good shape.

00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:17.040
We have a real number.

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:19.950
This could be negative.

00:14:19.950 --> 00:14:22.150
And a number, when
you square it,

00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:23.910
is going to be a
positive number.

00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:25.650
So this makes sense.

00:14:25.650 --> 00:14:29.740
We're writing something
that at least makes sense.

00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:32.370
Another way, of course,
to write this equation,

00:14:32.370 --> 00:14:35.065
if you prefer--
this inequality, I

00:14:35.065 --> 00:14:38.750
mean-- is to take
the square root.

00:14:38.750 --> 00:14:43.040
So you could write it
delta A times delta

00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:50.460
B. Since this is a real number,
I can take the square root

00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:57.300
and write just this as absolute
value of psi, 1 over 2i i

00:14:57.300 --> 00:15:02.050
A B psi.

00:15:02.050 --> 00:15:05.685
And these bars here
are absolute value.

00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:12.880
They're not norm of a vector.

00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:16.080
They are not norm
of a complex number.

00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:20.460
They are just absolute value,
because the thing inside

00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:22.400
is a real thing.

00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:27.160
So if you prefer,
whatever you like better,

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:32.070
you've got here the statement
of the uncertainty principle.

00:15:32.070 --> 00:15:36.450
So the good thing about
this uncertainty principle

00:15:36.450 --> 00:15:41.160
formulated this way is that
it's completely precise,

00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:44.700
because you've defined
uncertainties precisely.

00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:48.250
Many times, when you first
study the uncertainty principle,

00:15:48.250 --> 00:15:51.020
you don't define
uncertainties precisely,

00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:53.050
and the uncertainty
principle is something

00:15:53.050 --> 00:15:59.600
that goes with [? sim ?] is
approximately equal to this.

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:02.830
And you make statements that
are intuitively interesting,

00:16:02.830 --> 00:16:04.670
but are not thoroughly precise.

00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:07.060
Yes, question, yes.

00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:08.810
AUDIENCE: Should that
be greater or equal?

00:16:08.810 --> 00:16:15.020
PROFESSOR: Greater than or equal
to, yes-- no miracles here.

00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:18.000
Other question?

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:18.630
Other question?

00:16:25.850 --> 00:16:29.960
So we have to prove this.

00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:31.920
And why do you
have to prove this?

00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:34.640
This is a case,
actually, in which

00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:39.020
many interesting questions
are based on the proof.

00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:42.100
Why would that be the case?

00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:47.630
Well, a question that is
always of great interest

00:16:47.630 --> 00:16:50.080
is reducing uncertainties.

00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:58.140
Now, if two operators commute,
this right-hand side is 0

00:16:58.140 --> 00:17:00.420
and it just says
that the uncertainty

00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:03.830
could be made
perhaps equal to 0.

00:17:03.830 --> 00:17:06.839
It doesn't mean that
the uncertainty is 0.

00:17:06.839 --> 00:17:10.010
It may depend on the state,
even if the operators commute.

00:17:10.010 --> 00:17:13.190
This is just telling
you it's bigger than 0,

00:17:13.190 --> 00:17:18.579
and perhaps by being clever,
you can make it equal to 0.

00:17:18.579 --> 00:17:21.230
Similarly, when you
have two operators that

00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:24.670
just don't commute, it
is of great importance

00:17:24.670 --> 00:17:28.920
to try to figure out if there
is some states for which

00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:32.690
the uncertainty
relation is saturated.

00:17:32.690 --> 00:17:36.390
So this is the question
that, in fact, you could not

00:17:36.390 --> 00:17:42.490
answer if you just know this
theorem written like this,

00:17:42.490 --> 00:17:44.940
because there's
no statement here

00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:50.430
of what are the conditions
for which this inequality is

00:17:50.430 --> 00:17:51.960
saturated.

00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:55.410
So as we'll do the proof,
we'll find those conditions.

00:17:55.410 --> 00:17:59.350
And in fact, they go
a little beyond what

00:17:59.350 --> 00:18:02.690
the Schwarz
inequality would say.

00:18:02.690 --> 00:18:07.180
I mentioned last time that
this is a classic example

00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:09.880
of something that looks
like the Schwarz inequality,

00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:12.020
and indeed, that will
be the central part

00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:13.540
of the demonstration.

00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:18.570
But there's one extra step
there that we will have to do.

00:18:18.570 --> 00:18:23.230
And therefore, if you
want to understand

00:18:23.230 --> 00:18:28.020
when this is saturated, when
do you have minimum uncertainty

00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:33.230
states, then you need
to know the proof.

00:18:33.230 --> 00:18:37.830
So before we do, of
course, even the proof,

00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:40.750
there's an example--
the classic illustration

00:18:40.750 --> 00:18:50.509
that should be mentioned--
A equal x and B equals p,

00:18:50.509 --> 00:18:53.880
xp equal i h bar.

00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:55.960
That's the identity.

00:18:55.960 --> 00:19:02.930
So delta x squared
delta p squared

00:19:02.930 --> 00:19:09.965
is greater or equal than psi 1
over 2i-- the commutator-- i h

00:19:09.965 --> 00:19:16.940
bar 1 psi squared.

00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:18.740
And what do we get here?

00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:24.580
We get the i's cancel, the h bar
over 2 goes out, gets squared,

00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:28.356
and everything else is equal
to 1, because h is normalized.

00:19:31.130 --> 00:19:36.860
So the precise version of
the uncertainty principle

00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:43.340
is this one for x and p.

00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:49.240
And we will, of course,
try to figure out

00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:50.970
when we can saturate this.

00:19:50.970 --> 00:19:53.320
What kind of wave
functions saturate them?

00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:59.015
You know the ones that are
just sort of strange-- if x

00:19:59.015 --> 00:20:02.100
is totally localized, the
uncertainty of momentum

00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:07.210
must be infinite, because
if delta x is 0, well,

00:20:07.210 --> 00:20:09.850
to make this something that
at least doesn't contradict

00:20:09.850 --> 00:20:12.970
the identity, delta
p better be infinite.

00:20:12.970 --> 00:20:15.450
Similarly, if you
have an eigenstate

00:20:15.450 --> 00:20:19.420
of p, which is a wave,
is totally delocalized,

00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:22.270
and you have infinite
here and 0 here.

00:20:22.270 --> 00:20:25.370
Well, they're interesting
states that have both,

00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:28.580
and we're going to
try to find the ones

00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:30.960
of minimum uncertainty.

00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:34.810
So OK, we've stated
the principle.

00:20:34.810 --> 00:20:36.860
We've given an example.

00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:38.620
We've calculated an uncertainty.

00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:43.320
Let us prove the theorem.

00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:49.580
So as we mentioned before, this
idea that the uncertainty is

00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:51.810
a norm, is a good one.

00:20:51.810 --> 00:20:55.240
So let's define two
auxilliary variables--

00:20:55.240 --> 00:21:03.300
f, a state f, which is going
to be A minus the expectation

00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:08.180
value of A on psi.

00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:10.810
And we can put the ket here.

00:21:10.810 --> 00:21:15.960
And g, which is going to
be B minus the expectation

00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:20.505
value of B, psi.

00:21:23.330 --> 00:21:28.100
Now what do we know about this?

00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:32.700
Well the uncertainties are
the norms of these states,

00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:35.250
so the norm squared
of these states

00:21:35.250 --> 00:21:36.940
are the uncertainty squared.

00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:46.580
So delta A squared is
f f, the norm squared.

00:21:46.580 --> 00:21:51.712
And delta B squared is g g.

00:21:55.100 --> 00:22:02.490
And Schwarz' inequality
says that the norm

00:22:02.490 --> 00:22:06.000
of f times the normal
of g is greater than

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:10.460
or equal than the absolute
value of the inner product of f

00:22:10.460 --> 00:22:12.520
with g.

00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:17.870
So squaring this thing,
which is convenient perhaps

00:22:17.870 --> 00:22:24.950
at this moment, we have f
f-- norm squared of f-- norm

00:22:24.950 --> 00:22:34.800
squared of g must be greater
than or equal than f g squared,

00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:36.170
absolute value squared.

00:22:40.490 --> 00:22:41.920
So this is Schwarz.

00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:55.540
And this is going to
just make a note-- here

00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:58.360
we know when this is saturated.

00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:02.400
It will be saturated
if f is parallel to g.

00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:05.230
If these two vectors are
parallel to each other,

00:23:05.230 --> 00:23:07.250
the Schwarz inequality
is saturated.

00:23:07.250 --> 00:23:09.980
So that's something
to keep in mind.

00:23:09.980 --> 00:23:12.510
We'll use it soon enough.

00:23:12.510 --> 00:23:18.480
But at this moment, we can
simply rewrite this as delta

00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:24.280
A squared times delta B
squared-- after all, those

00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:29.520
were definitions-- are
greater than or equal--

00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:35.420
and this is going to be a
complex number in general,

00:23:35.420 --> 00:23:41.780
so f g in Schwarz' inequality
is just a complex number.

00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:53.540
So this is real of f g squared,
plus the imaginary part

00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:57.345
of f g squared.

00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:07.720
So that's what we have--
real and imaginary part.

00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:11.680
So let's try to get what f g is.

00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:16.610
So what is f g?

00:24:16.610 --> 00:24:18.800
Let's compute it.

00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:24.180
Well we must take the bra
corresponding to this,

00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:25.730
so this is psi.

00:24:25.730 --> 00:24:28.180
Since the operator
is Hermitian, you

00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:33.130
have A minus
expectation value of A,

00:24:33.130 --> 00:24:39.740
and here you have B minus
expectation value of B psi.

00:24:49.090 --> 00:24:53.650
Now we can expand this, and
it will be useful to expand.

00:24:53.650 --> 00:24:58.690
But at the same time, I will
invent a little notation here.

00:24:58.690 --> 00:25:05.390
I'll call this A check,
and this B check.

00:25:05.390 --> 00:25:14.360
And for reference, I'll put
that this is psi A check B check

00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:14.860
psi.

00:25:18.970 --> 00:25:23.000
On the other hand, let's
just compute what we get.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.190
So what do we get?

00:25:26.190 --> 00:25:31.010
Well, let's expand this.

00:25:31.010 --> 00:25:35.670
Well, the first term is
A times B on psi psi,

00:25:35.670 --> 00:25:37.610
and we're not going
to be able to do

00:25:37.610 --> 00:25:42.960
much about that-- A B psi.

00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:49.050
And then we start getting
funny terms-- A cross with B,

00:25:49.050 --> 00:25:51.910
and that's-- if you
think about it a second,

00:25:51.910 --> 00:25:55.655
this is just going to be equal
to the expectation value of A

00:25:55.655 --> 00:25:58.280
times the expectation of B,
because the expectation value

00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:03.080
of B is a number, and then A
is sandwich between two psi.

00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:07.770
So from this cross product,
you get expectation value

00:26:07.770 --> 00:26:11.400
of A, expectation value
of B, with a minus sign.

00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:14.450
From this cross product, you
get the expectation value of A

00:26:14.450 --> 00:26:18.030
and expectation value of B--
another one with a minus sign.

00:26:18.030 --> 00:26:20.500
And then one with a plus sign.

00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:27.790
So the end result is a
single one with a minus sign.

00:26:27.790 --> 00:26:42.740
So expectation value of A,
expectation value of B. Now,

00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:47.250
if I change f and
g, I would like

00:26:47.250 --> 00:26:52.220
to compute not only fg inner
product, but gf inner product.

00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:54.090
And you may say why?

00:26:54.090 --> 00:26:58.370
Well, I want it because
I need the real part

00:26:58.370 --> 00:27:04.390
and the imaginary parts, and
gf is the complex conjugate

00:27:04.390 --> 00:27:08.070
of f g, so might
as well compute it.

00:27:08.070 --> 00:27:11.230
So what is gf?

00:27:11.230 --> 00:27:14.120
Now you don't have to do
the calculation again,

00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:17.510
because basically you
change g to f or f

00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:20.990
to g by exchanging A
and B. So I can just

00:27:20.990 --> 00:27:32.360
say that this is psi
B A psi minus A B.

00:27:32.360 --> 00:27:35.060
And if I write it
this way, I say

00:27:35.060 --> 00:27:41.300
it's just psi B
check A check psi.

00:27:44.530 --> 00:27:49.670
OK so we've done some work, and
the reason we've done this work

00:27:49.670 --> 00:27:51.825
is because we
actually need to write

00:27:51.825 --> 00:27:57.880
the right-hand side
of the inequality.

00:27:57.880 --> 00:28:01.400
And let's, therefore,
explore what these ones are.

00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:09.200
So for example, the
imaginary part of f g

00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:19.682
is 1 over 2i f g minus its
complex conjugate-- gf.

00:28:27.590 --> 00:28:29.680
Imaginary part of
a complex number

00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:34.040
is z minus z star divided by 2i.

00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:38.740
now, fg minus gf
is actually simple,

00:28:38.740 --> 00:28:43.660
because this product of
expectation values cancel,

00:28:43.660 --> 00:28:48.210
and this gives me the
commutator of A with B.

00:28:48.210 --> 00:28:55.650
So this is 1 over 2i, and
you have psi expectation

00:28:55.650 --> 00:29:00.040
value of A B commutator.

00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:04.550
So actually, that looks
exactly like what we want.

00:29:04.550 --> 00:29:09.470
And we're not going to be
able to simplify it more.

00:29:09.470 --> 00:29:12.550
We can put the 1 over 2i inside.

00:29:12.550 --> 00:29:13.450
That fine.

00:29:13.450 --> 00:29:15.800
It's sort of in the operator.

00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:21.490
It can go out, but we're not
going to do better than that.

00:29:21.490 --> 00:29:24.820
You already recognize,
in some sense,

00:29:24.820 --> 00:29:29.390
the inequality we want
to prove, because if this

00:29:29.390 --> 00:29:33.340
is that, you could ignore
this and say, well,

00:29:33.340 --> 00:29:36.380
it's anyway greater
than this thing.

00:29:36.380 --> 00:29:39.770
And that's this term.

00:29:39.770 --> 00:29:43.040
But let's write the other one,
at least for a little while.

00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:57.490
Real of fg would be
1/2 of fg plus gf.

00:29:57.490 --> 00:30:00.110
And now it is your choice
how you write this.

00:30:00.110 --> 00:30:03.870
There's nothing great
that you can do.

00:30:03.870 --> 00:30:09.890
The sum of these two things
have AB plus BA and then twice

00:30:09.890 --> 00:30:13.000
of this expectation
value, so it's not

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:17.080
nothing particularly inspiring.

00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:22.420
So you put these
two terms and just

00:30:22.420 --> 00:30:29.450
write it like this-- 1/2
of psi anti-commutator

00:30:29.450 --> 00:30:32.520
off A check with B check.

00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:37.710
Anti-commutator, remember,
is this combination

00:30:37.710 --> 00:30:40.310
of operators in which you
take the product in one way,

00:30:40.310 --> 00:30:42.450
and add the product
in the other way.

00:30:42.450 --> 00:30:45.870
So I've used this
formula to write this,

00:30:45.870 --> 00:30:49.280
and you could write it as an
anti-commutator of A and B

00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:54.200
minus 2 times the
expectation values,

00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:56.490
or whichever way you want it.

00:30:56.490 --> 00:31:00.830
But at the end of the
day, that's what it is.

00:31:00.830 --> 00:31:03.140
And you cannot simplify it much.

00:31:03.140 --> 00:31:08.850
So your uncertainty
principle has become delta

00:31:08.850 --> 00:31:12.960
A squared delta
B squared greater

00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:25.340
than or equal to expectation
value of psi 1 over 2i A B psi

00:31:25.340 --> 00:31:36.130
squared plus expectation
value of psi 1 over 2

00:31:36.130 --> 00:31:42.840
A check B check psi squared.

00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:46.840
And some people call this
the generalized uncertainty

00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:48.120
principle.

00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:50.940
You may find some
textbooks that tell you

00:31:50.940 --> 00:31:54.710
"Prove the generalized
uncertainty principle,"

00:31:54.710 --> 00:31:56.880
because that's
really what you get

00:31:56.880 --> 00:32:01.860
if you follow the rules
and Schwarz' inequality.

00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:03.570
So it is of some interest.

00:32:03.570 --> 00:32:09.200
It is conceivable that sometimes
you may want to use this.

00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:14.530
But the fact is that
this is a real number.

00:32:14.530 --> 00:32:17.800
This is a Hermitian
operator as well.

00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:19.420
This is a real number.

00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:21.250
This is a positive number.

00:32:21.250 --> 00:32:27.350
So if you ignore it, you still
have the inequality holding.

00:32:27.350 --> 00:32:31.020
And many times-- and that's
the interesting thing--

00:32:31.020 --> 00:32:33.650
you really are
justified to ignore it.

00:32:33.650 --> 00:32:36.900
In fact, I don't know
of a single example--

00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:40.640
perhaps somebody can tell me--
in which that second term is

00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:41.140
useful.

00:32:44.300 --> 00:32:53.300
So what you say at this moment
is go ahead, drop that term,

00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:56.900
and get an inequality.

00:32:56.900 --> 00:33:07.380
So it follows directly from
that, from this inequality,

00:33:07.380 --> 00:33:12.710
that delta A squared
delta B squared

00:33:12.710 --> 00:33:15.720
is greater than or equal--
you might say, well,

00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:16.930
how do you know it's equal?

00:33:16.930 --> 00:33:19.460
Maybe that thing cannot be 0.

00:33:19.460 --> 00:33:22.330
Well, it can be 0
in some examples.

00:33:22.330 --> 00:33:29.460
So it's still greater than
or equal to psi 1 over 2i

00:33:29.460 --> 00:33:36.080
A B psi squared.

00:33:39.430 --> 00:33:43.090
And that's by ignoring
the positive quantity.

00:33:43.090 --> 00:33:49.130
So that is really the proof
of the uncertainty principle.

00:33:49.130 --> 00:33:54.960
But now we can ask what
are the things that

00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:58.030
have to happen for the
uncertainty principle

00:33:58.030 --> 00:34:00.290
to be saturated?

00:34:00.290 --> 00:34:08.199
That you really have delta A
delta B equal to this quantity,

00:34:08.199 --> 00:34:09.649
so when can we saturate?

00:34:19.530 --> 00:34:23.280
OK, what do we need?

00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:28.350
First we need Schwarz
inequality saturation.

00:34:28.350 --> 00:34:33.730
So f and g must be states that
are proportional to each other.

00:34:33.730 --> 00:34:42.623
So we need one, that
Schwarz is saturated.

00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:55.679
Which means that g is
some number times f,

00:34:55.679 --> 00:35:00.660
where beta is a complex number.

00:35:00.660 --> 00:35:03.780
This is complex vector
space, so parallel

00:35:03.780 --> 00:35:06.100
means multiply by
a complex number.

00:35:06.100 --> 00:35:09.430
That's still a parallel vector.

00:35:09.430 --> 00:35:13.130
So this is the
saturation of Schwarz.

00:35:13.130 --> 00:35:15.920
Now, what else do we need?

00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:18.780
Well, we need that
this quantity be

00:35:18.780 --> 00:35:25.570
0 as well, that the real part
of this thing is equal to 0.

00:35:25.570 --> 00:35:28.130
Otherwise, you really
cannot reach it.

00:35:28.130 --> 00:35:32.010
The true inequality is this,
so if you have Schwarz,

00:35:32.010 --> 00:35:33.070
you've saturated.

00:35:33.070 --> 00:35:36.390
This thing is equal
to this thing.

00:35:36.390 --> 00:35:39.440
The left-hand side is equal
to this whole right-hand side.

00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:41.680
Schwarz buys you that.

00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:45.440
But now we want this to
be just equal to that.

00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:52.010
So this thing must be
0, so the real part of f

00:35:52.010 --> 00:36:00.020
overlap g-- of fg must be 0.

00:36:00.020 --> 00:36:01.160
What does that mean?

00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:11.180
It means that fg
plus gf has to be 0.

00:36:11.180 --> 00:36:16.600
But now we know what g is,
so we can plug it here.

00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:19.310
So g is beta times f.

00:36:19.310 --> 00:36:26.850
Beta goes out, and
you get beta f f.

00:36:26.850 --> 00:36:31.120
Now when you form the bra
g, beta becomes beta star.

00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:38.730
So you get beta
star f f equals 0.

00:36:38.730 --> 00:36:45.640
And since f need not have
zero norm, because there

00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:48.530
is some uncertainty
presumably, you

00:36:48.530 --> 00:36:59.460
have that beta plus beta star
is equal to 0, or real of beta

00:36:59.460 --> 00:37:02.470
is equal to 0.

00:37:02.470 --> 00:37:07.190
So that said, it's not that bad.

00:37:07.190 --> 00:37:12.410
You need two things--
that the f and g vectors

00:37:12.410 --> 00:37:16.920
be parallel with a
complex constant,

00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:21.500
but actually, that constant
must be purely imaginary.

00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:31.260
So beta is purely
imaginary-- that this beta

00:37:31.260 --> 00:37:35.395
is equal to i lambda,
with lambda real.

00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:44.560
And we then are in shape.

00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:53.410
So for saturation,
we need just g

00:37:53.410 --> 00:37:57.120
to be that, and g to be beta f.

00:37:57.120 --> 00:38:08.220
So let me write that
equation over here.

00:38:08.220 --> 00:38:11.730
So g-- what was g?

00:38:11.730 --> 00:38:31.960
It's B, B minus absolute
value of B on psi, which is g,

00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:39.320
must be equal to beta,
which is i lambda

00:38:39.320 --> 00:38:43.963
A minus absolute
value of A on psi.

00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:54.186
Condition-- so this is the
final condition for saturation.

00:39:05.190 --> 00:39:09.380
now, that's a
strange-looking equation.

00:39:09.380 --> 00:39:11.810
It's not all that
obvious how you're even

00:39:11.810 --> 00:39:15.450
supposed to begin solving it.

00:39:15.450 --> 00:39:16.390
Why is that?

00:39:16.390 --> 00:39:20.080
Well, you're trying
to look for a psi,

00:39:20.080 --> 00:39:22.360
and you have a
constraint on the psi.

00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:24.485
The psi must satisfy this.

00:39:27.990 --> 00:39:32.640
I actually will tell
both Arum and Will

00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:37.990
to discuss some of these
things in recitation--

00:39:37.990 --> 00:39:42.030
how to calculate minimum
uncertainty wave packets based

00:39:42.030 --> 00:39:44.460
on this equation,
and what it means.

00:39:44.460 --> 00:39:46.810
But in principle, what
do you have to do?

00:39:46.810 --> 00:39:50.000
You have some kind of
differential equation,

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:53.280
because you have, say, x and
p, and you want to saturate.

00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:56.330
So this is x, and this is p.

00:39:56.330 --> 00:39:59.760
Since p, you want to use a
coordinate representation,

00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:03.110
this will be a derivative, and
this will be a multiplication,

00:40:03.110 --> 00:40:06.460
so you'll get a differential
equation on the wave function.

00:40:06.460 --> 00:40:10.260
So you write an answer
for the wave function.

00:40:10.260 --> 00:40:13.260
You must calculate the
expectation value of B.

00:40:13.260 --> 00:40:15.480
You must calculate the
expectation value of A,

00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:17.620
and then plug into
this equation,

00:40:17.620 --> 00:40:20.570
and try to see if
your answer allows

00:40:20.570 --> 00:40:26.410
a solution-- and a solution
with some number here, lambda.

00:40:26.410 --> 00:40:28.590
At least one thing
I can tell you

00:40:28.590 --> 00:40:32.600
before you try this too hard--
this lambda is essentially

00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:38.470
fixed, because we can take
the norm of this equation.

00:40:38.470 --> 00:40:41.275
And that's an interesting
fact-- take the norm.

00:40:45.330 --> 00:40:48.190
And what is the norm of this?

00:40:48.190 --> 00:40:55.210
This is delta B, the
norm of this state.

00:40:55.210 --> 00:40:59.880
And the norm of i lambda--,
well norm of i is 1.

00:40:59.880 --> 00:41:02.740
Norm of lambda is
absolute value of lambda,

00:41:02.740 --> 00:41:04.910
because lambda was real.

00:41:04.910 --> 00:41:12.720
And you have delta A
here of psi, of course.

00:41:12.720 --> 00:41:19.410
So lambda can be either
plus or minus delta B

00:41:19.410 --> 00:41:23.910
of psi over delta A of psi.

00:41:23.910 --> 00:41:26.200
So that's not an
arbitrary constant.

00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:28.590
It's fixed by the
equation already,

00:41:28.590 --> 00:41:30.345
in terms of things
that you know.

00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:38.980
And therefore, this
will be a subject

00:41:38.980 --> 00:41:43.850
of problems in a little bit of
your recitation, in which you,

00:41:43.850 --> 00:41:50.980
hopefully, discuss how to find
minimum uncertainty packets.

00:41:50.980 --> 00:41:56.310
All right, so that's
it for the proof

00:41:56.310 --> 00:41:58.920
of the uncertainty principle.

00:41:58.920 --> 00:42:02.830
And as I told you, the proof
is useful in particular

00:42:02.830 --> 00:42:06.520
to find those special states
of saturated uncertainty.

00:42:06.520 --> 00:42:09.550
We'll have a lot to say
about them for the harmonic

00:42:09.550 --> 00:42:15.100
oscillator later on, and in
fact throughout the course.

00:42:15.100 --> 00:42:18.710
So are there any questions?

00:42:18.710 --> 00:42:19.950
Yes.

00:42:19.950 --> 00:42:22.450
AUDIENCE: So if we have one of
the states and an eigenstate,

00:42:22.450 --> 00:42:26.960
we know that [INAUDIBLE]
is 0 and we then

00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:29.214
mandate that the uncertainty
of the other variable

00:42:29.214 --> 00:42:29.922
must be infinite.

00:42:32.700 --> 00:42:35.770
But is it even possible to
talk about the uncertainty?

00:42:35.770 --> 00:42:38.125
And if so, are we
still guaranteed--

00:42:38.125 --> 00:42:40.096
we know that it's
infinite, but it's

00:42:40.096 --> 00:42:44.710
possible for 0 and an infinite
number to multiply [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:44.710 --> 00:42:48.860
PROFESSOR: Right, so you're in a
somewhat uncomfortable position

00:42:48.860 --> 00:42:51.470
if you have zero uncertainty.

00:42:51.470 --> 00:42:53.630
Then you need the other
one to be infinite.

00:42:53.630 --> 00:42:57.760
So the way, presumably,
you should think of that,

00:42:57.760 --> 00:43:01.590
is that you should take limits
of sequences of wave functions

00:43:01.590 --> 00:43:04.640
in which the uncertainty
in x is going to 0,

00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:07.710
and you will find that
as you take the limit,

00:43:07.710 --> 00:43:11.510
and delta x is going to 0, and
delta p is going to infinity,

00:43:11.510 --> 00:43:12.773
you can still have that.

00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:16.833
Other questions?

00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:29.720
Well, having done this, let's
try the more subtle case

00:43:29.720 --> 00:43:35.700
of the uncertainty principle
for energy and time.

00:43:35.700 --> 00:43:40.880
So that is a pretty
interesting subject, actually.

00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:44.520
And should I erase here?

00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:45.675
Yes, I think so.

00:43:52.550 --> 00:43:56.100
Actually, [? Griffith ?]
says that it's usually

00:43:56.100 --> 00:44:00.430
badly misunderstood, this
energy-time uncertainty

00:44:00.430 --> 00:44:04.960
principle, but seldom
your misunderstanding

00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:07.860
leads to a serious mistake.

00:44:07.860 --> 00:44:10.390
So you're saved.

00:44:10.390 --> 00:44:17.150
It's used in a hand-wavy way,
and it's roughly correct,

00:44:17.150 --> 00:44:19.835
although people say all
kinds of funny things

00:44:19.835 --> 00:44:21.670
that are not exactly right.

00:44:21.670 --> 00:44:37.670
So energy time
uncertainty-- so let

00:44:37.670 --> 00:44:42.910
me give a small motivation--
a hand-wavy motivation,

00:44:42.910 --> 00:44:46.290
so it doesn't get us
very far, but at least it

00:44:46.290 --> 00:44:49.060
gives you a picture
of what's going on.

00:44:49.060 --> 00:44:55.910
And these uncertainty
relations, in some sense,

00:44:55.910 --> 00:45:02.260
have a basis on some
simple statements that

00:45:02.260 --> 00:45:06.790
are totally classical, and
maybe a little imprecise,

00:45:06.790 --> 00:45:11.690
but incontrovertible,
about looking at waveforms,

00:45:11.690 --> 00:45:14.060
and trying to figure
out what's going on.

00:45:14.060 --> 00:45:20.850
So for example, suppose in
time you detect a fluctuation

00:45:20.850 --> 00:45:27.250
that as time progresses,
just suddenly turns on.

00:45:27.250 --> 00:45:31.660
Some wave that just dies
off after a little while.

00:45:31.660 --> 00:45:34.120
And you have a
good understanding

00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:36.640
of when it started,
and when it ended.

00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:45.610
And there's a time T.

00:45:45.610 --> 00:45:49.480
So whenever you have
a situation like that,

00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:53.560
you can try to count the
number of waves-- full waves

00:45:53.560 --> 00:45:56.260
that you see here.

00:45:56.260 --> 00:46:04.990
So the number of waves
would be equal to--

00:46:04.990 --> 00:46:11.790
or periods, number
of full waves--

00:46:11.790 --> 00:46:22.670
would be the total time divided
by the period of this wave.

00:46:22.670 --> 00:46:25.830
So sometimes T is
called the period.

00:46:25.830 --> 00:46:28.240
But here, T is the
total time here,

00:46:28.240 --> 00:46:30.690
and the period is
2 pi over omega.

00:46:30.690 --> 00:46:39.540
So we say this is
omega t over 2 pi.

00:46:39.540 --> 00:46:45.510
Now, the problem with these
waves that begin and end,

00:46:45.510 --> 00:46:48.330
is that you can't
quite see or make

00:46:48.330 --> 00:46:50.950
sure that you've got
the full wave here.

00:46:50.950 --> 00:46:56.210
So in the hand-wavy
way, we say that even

00:46:56.210 --> 00:46:59.090
as we looked at the
perfectly well-defined,

00:46:59.090 --> 00:47:01.170
and you know the
shape exactly-- it's

00:47:01.170 --> 00:47:04.070
been measured-- you can't
quite tell whether you've

00:47:04.070 --> 00:47:07.840
got the full wave here or
a quarter of a wave more,

00:47:07.840 --> 00:47:14.890
so there's an uncertainty in
delta n which is of order 1.

00:47:14.890 --> 00:47:18.700
You miss half on one side,
and half on the other side.

00:47:18.700 --> 00:47:22.350
So if you have an
uncertainty here of order 1,

00:47:22.350 --> 00:47:25.760
and you have no
uncertainty in T,

00:47:25.760 --> 00:47:29.090
you would claim that
you have, actually,

00:47:29.090 --> 00:47:33.990
in some sense, an
uncertainty in what omega is.

00:47:33.990 --> 00:47:36.670
Omega might be well
measured here, but somehow

00:47:36.670 --> 00:47:39.480
towards the end you
can't quite see.

00:47:39.480 --> 00:47:45.260
T we said was precise, so
over 2 pi is equal to 1.

00:47:45.260 --> 00:47:49.700
I just took a delta of here,
and I said P is precise,

00:47:49.700 --> 00:47:52.050
so it's delta omega.

00:47:52.050 --> 00:47:55.610
So this is a
classical statement.

00:47:55.610 --> 00:47:59.100
An electrical engineer
would not need

00:47:59.100 --> 00:48:03.820
to know any quantum mechanics
to say that's about right,

00:48:03.820 --> 00:48:07.240
and you can make it
more or less precise.

00:48:07.240 --> 00:48:10.160
But that's a
classical statement.

00:48:10.160 --> 00:48:12.650
In quantum mechanics,
all that happens

00:48:12.650 --> 00:48:17.110
is that something has
become quantum, and the idea

00:48:17.110 --> 00:48:19.520
that you have
something like this,

00:48:19.520 --> 00:48:24.310
we can associate it with
a particle, a photon,

00:48:24.310 --> 00:48:28.630
and in which case, the
uncertainty in omega

00:48:28.630 --> 00:48:30.350
is uncertainty in energy.

00:48:30.350 --> 00:48:41.020
So for a photon, the uncertainty
is equal to h bar omega,

00:48:41.020 --> 00:48:48.970
so delta omega times h bar
is equal to the uncertainty

00:48:48.970 --> 00:48:49.470
in energy.

00:48:52.010 --> 00:49:00.150
So if you plug it in here,
you multiply it by h bar here,

00:49:00.150 --> 00:49:10.280
and you would get delta E
times T is equal to 2 pi h bar.

00:49:14.800 --> 00:49:17.350
And then you have to add words.

00:49:17.350 --> 00:49:19.140
What is T?

00:49:19.140 --> 00:49:22.430
Well, this T is the
time it takes the photon

00:49:22.430 --> 00:49:24.710
to go through your detector.

00:49:24.710 --> 00:49:26.520
You've been seeing it.

00:49:26.520 --> 00:49:27.560
You saw a wave.

00:49:27.560 --> 00:49:30.500
You recorded it, and took
a time T-- began, ended.

00:49:30.500 --> 00:49:34.260
And it so it's the
time it took you

00:49:34.260 --> 00:49:38.170
to have the pulse go through.

00:49:38.170 --> 00:49:42.600
And that time is related
to an uncertainty

00:49:42.600 --> 00:49:44.790
in the energy of the photon.

00:49:44.790 --> 00:49:48.500
And that's sort of the beginning
of a time energy uncertainty

00:49:48.500 --> 00:49:49.830
relationship.

00:49:49.830 --> 00:49:52.640
This is quantum,
because the idea

00:49:52.640 --> 00:49:56.110
that photons carry energies
and they're quantized--

00:49:56.110 --> 00:50:00.230
this is a single photon-- and
this connection with energy

00:50:00.230 --> 00:50:01.105
is quantum mechanics.

00:50:04.170 --> 00:50:08.110
So this is good and
reasonable intuition, perhaps.

00:50:08.110 --> 00:50:11.480
And it can be the basis
of all kinds of things.

00:50:11.480 --> 00:50:16.470
But it points out the fact that
the more delicate part here

00:50:16.470 --> 00:50:23.100
is T. How could I speak
of a time uncertainty?

00:50:23.100 --> 00:50:27.420
And the fact is that you can't
speak of a time uncertainty

00:50:27.420 --> 00:50:29.750
really precisely.

00:50:29.750 --> 00:50:31.830
And the reason is,
because there's

00:50:31.830 --> 00:50:34.950
no Hermitian operator
for which we could say,

00:50:34.950 --> 00:50:39.630
OK the eigenstates of this
Hermitian operator are times,

00:50:39.630 --> 00:50:44.100
and then you have a norm,
and it's an uncertainty.

00:50:44.100 --> 00:50:45.210
So you can't do it.

00:50:45.210 --> 00:50:49.530
So you have to do something
different this time.

00:50:49.530 --> 00:50:52.160
And happily, there's
something you

00:50:52.160 --> 00:50:55.360
can do that is precise
and makes sense.

00:50:55.360 --> 00:51:00.460
So we'll do it.

00:51:00.460 --> 00:51:04.330
So what we have to do is just
try to use the uncertainty

00:51:04.330 --> 00:51:08.730
principle that we have,
and at least one operator.

00:51:08.730 --> 00:51:11.370
We can use something
that is good for us.

00:51:11.370 --> 00:51:14.740
We want uncertainty in energy,
and we have the Hamiltonian.

00:51:14.740 --> 00:51:15.850
It's an operator.

00:51:15.850 --> 00:51:19.660
So for that one, we can use
it, and that's the clue.

00:51:19.660 --> 00:51:31.900
So you'll take A to be
the Hamiltonian, and B

00:51:31.900 --> 00:51:35.870
to be some operator
Q that may depend

00:51:35.870 --> 00:51:41.070
on some things-- for example,
x and p, or whatever you want.

00:51:41.070 --> 00:51:43.820
But the one thing I want
to ask from this operator

00:51:43.820 --> 00:51:58.210
is that Q has no explicit time
dependence-- no explicit time

00:51:58.210 --> 00:51:59.255
dependence whatsoever.

00:52:02.800 --> 00:52:08.620
So let's see what this gives us
as an uncertainty relationship.

00:52:08.620 --> 00:52:15.140
Well, it would give us
that delta H squared--

00:52:15.140 --> 00:52:20.770
that's delta Q
squared-- would be

00:52:20.770 --> 00:52:27.780
greater than or equal
to the square of psi 1

00:52:27.780 --> 00:52:36.780
over 2i H with Q psi.

00:52:46.070 --> 00:52:49.160
OK, that's it.

00:52:49.160 --> 00:52:54.520
Well, but in order to get
some intuition from here,

00:52:54.520 --> 00:52:59.170
we better be able
to interpret this.

00:52:59.170 --> 00:53:00.820
This doesn't seem
to have anything

00:53:00.820 --> 00:53:03.050
to do with energy and time.

00:53:03.050 --> 00:53:08.260
So is there something
to do with time here?

00:53:08.260 --> 00:53:15.500
That is, in fact, a
very well-known result

00:53:15.500 --> 00:53:20.220
in quantum mechanics--
that somehow commutators

00:53:20.220 --> 00:53:27.460
with the Hamiltonian test the
time derivative of operators.

00:53:27.460 --> 00:53:31.970
So whenever you see an
H with Q commutator,

00:53:31.970 --> 00:53:35.800
you think ah, that's
roughly dQ dt.

00:53:41.229 --> 00:53:42.770
And we'll see what
happens with that.

00:53:42.770 --> 00:53:45.157
And say, oh, dQ
dt, but it doesn't

00:53:45.157 --> 00:53:46.850
depend on T-- you said 0.

00:53:46.850 --> 00:53:50.080
No it's not 0.

00:53:50.080 --> 00:53:54.350
There's no explicit dependence,
but we'll see what happens.

00:53:54.350 --> 00:53:58.080
So at this moment, you really
have to stop for one second

00:53:58.080 --> 00:54:05.030
and derive a familiar
result-- that may or may not

00:54:05.030 --> 00:54:08.480
be that familiar
to you from 804.

00:54:08.480 --> 00:54:11.370
I don't think it was
all that emphasized.

00:54:11.370 --> 00:54:15.380
Consider expectation value of Q.

00:54:15.380 --> 00:54:17.780
And then the
expectation of Q-- let

00:54:17.780 --> 00:54:24.920
me write it as psi
Q psi, like this.

00:54:24.920 --> 00:54:29.890
Now let's try to take the
time derivative of this thing.

00:54:29.890 --> 00:54:34.960
So what is the time derivative
of the expectation value of q?

00:54:34.960 --> 00:54:38.440
And the idea being
that look, the operator

00:54:38.440 --> 00:54:42.900
depends on some
things, and it can

00:54:42.900 --> 00:54:45.850
have time-dependent
expectation value,

00:54:45.850 --> 00:54:48.980
because the state
is changing in time.

00:54:48.980 --> 00:54:52.360
So operators can have
time-dependent expectation

00:54:52.360 --> 00:54:56.260
values even though the
operators don't depend on time.

00:54:56.260 --> 00:54:58.900
So for example, this
depends on x and p,

00:54:58.900 --> 00:55:03.770
and the x and p in a harmonic
oscillator are time dependent.

00:55:03.770 --> 00:55:09.970
They're moving around, and this
could have time dependence.

00:55:09.970 --> 00:55:11.730
So what do we get from here?

00:55:11.730 --> 00:55:15.630
Well, if I have to take the
time derivative of this,

00:55:15.630 --> 00:55:27.280
I have d psi dt here, Q
psi, plus psi Q d psi dt.

00:55:27.280 --> 00:55:31.990
And in doing this, and not
differentiating Q itself,

00:55:31.990 --> 00:55:35.100
I've used the fact that
this is an operator

00:55:35.100 --> 00:55:37.710
and there's no time
anywhere there.

00:55:37.710 --> 00:55:54.530
I didn't have to
differentiate Q.

00:55:54.530 --> 00:55:59.370
So how do we evaluate this?

00:55:59.370 --> 00:56:01.890
Well, you remember the
Schrodinger equation.

00:56:01.890 --> 00:56:04.180
Here the Schrodinger
equation comes in,

00:56:04.180 --> 00:56:07.280
because you have time
derivatives of your state.

00:56:07.280 --> 00:56:15.590
So i d psi dt, i H bar d
psi dt is equal to H psi.

00:56:15.590 --> 00:56:20.450
That's a full time-dependent
Schrodinger equation.

00:56:20.450 --> 00:56:23.345
So here, maybe, I
should write this

00:56:23.345 --> 00:56:27.380
like that-- this is all
time-dependent stuff.

00:56:27.380 --> 00:56:31.780
At this moment, I don't
ignore the time dependence.

00:56:31.780 --> 00:56:34.670
The states are not
stationary states.

00:56:34.670 --> 00:56:36.770
If they would be
stationary states,

00:56:36.770 --> 00:56:40.030
there would be no
energy uncertainty.

00:56:40.030 --> 00:56:45.350
So I have this, and therefore,
I plug this in here,

00:56:45.350 --> 00:56:55.100
and what do we get? i H
bar h psi Q psi plus psi

00:56:55.100 --> 00:56:57.975
Q i H bar H psi.

00:57:01.690 --> 00:57:06.020
Now, I got the i H in the
wrong place-- sorry-- 1

00:57:06.020 --> 00:57:11.180
over i H bar, and
1 over i H bar.

00:57:14.710 --> 00:57:18.690
Now the first term--
this thing comes out

00:57:18.690 --> 00:57:22.280
as its complex
conjugate-- 1 minus i H

00:57:22.280 --> 00:57:25.470
bar, because it's
on the first input.

00:57:25.470 --> 00:57:29.040
H is Hermitian, so I can
send it to the other side,

00:57:29.040 --> 00:57:32.165
so psi, HQ psi.

00:57:35.480 --> 00:57:39.790
Second term-- the 1
over i H just goes out,

00:57:39.790 --> 00:57:42.140
and I don't have
to move anybody.

00:57:42.140 --> 00:57:44.635
QH is there, psi.

00:57:48.210 --> 00:57:52.120
So actually, this
is i over H bar,

00:57:52.120 --> 00:57:55.780
because minus i
down goes up with i.

00:57:55.780 --> 00:58:01.902
And I have here psi
HQ, and this is minus i

00:58:01.902 --> 00:58:09.570
over H bar, so I
get HQ minus QH psi.

00:58:09.570 --> 00:58:15.975
So this is your final result--
the expectation value d

00:58:15.975 --> 00:58:25.400
dt of the expectation value
of Q is equal to i over H bar,

00:58:25.400 --> 00:58:43.060
expectation value of the
commutator of H with Q.

00:58:43.060 --> 00:58:49.490
So this is neat, and it should
always stick in your mind.

00:58:49.490 --> 00:58:50.890
This is true.

00:58:50.890 --> 00:58:54.520
We will see the
Heisenberg way of writing

00:58:54.520 --> 00:58:57.500
this equation in a
little while-- not today,

00:58:57.500 --> 00:58:59.680
but in a couple of weeks.

00:58:59.680 --> 00:59:05.935
But maybe even write
it even more briefly

00:59:05.935 --> 00:59:10.386
as i over H bar
expectation value of HQ.

00:59:15.920 --> 00:59:23.790
So what do we get from here?

00:59:23.790 --> 00:59:28.250
Well, we can go back to
our uncertainty principle,

00:59:28.250 --> 00:59:33.710
and rewrite it, having learned
that we have time derivative.

00:59:33.710 --> 00:59:38.300
So time finally showed
up, and that's good news.

00:59:38.300 --> 00:59:42.110
So we're maybe not too far
from a clear interpretation

00:59:42.110 --> 00:59:44.050
of the uncertainty principle.

00:59:44.050 --> 00:59:48.920
So we're going back
to that top equation,

00:59:48.920 --> 00:59:52.900
so that what we
have now is delta

00:59:52.900 --> 01:00:00.090
H squared delta Q squared
is that thing over there,

01:00:00.090 --> 01:00:03.500
the expectation
value of 1 over 2i.

01:00:03.500 --> 01:00:05.550
There's some signs
there, so what

01:00:05.550 --> 01:00:24.690
do we have-- equals 1 over
2i H bar over i d dt of Q.

01:00:24.690 --> 01:00:30.960
So what I did here was to say
that this expectation value was

01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:35.250
H bar over i d dt of Q,
and I plugged it in there.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:44.290
So you square this thing, so
there's not too much really

01:00:44.290 --> 01:00:44.910
to be done.

01:00:44.910 --> 01:00:47.460
The i don't matter at
the end of the day.

01:00:47.460 --> 01:00:49.910
It's a minus 1
that gets squared.

01:00:49.910 --> 01:00:56.020
So the H bar over 2-- I'm
sorry-- the H bar over 2

01:00:56.020 --> 01:00:59.440
does remain here, squared.

01:00:59.440 --> 01:01:06.485
And you have dQ dt squared.

01:01:09.930 --> 01:01:12.790
Q is a Hermitian operator.

01:01:12.790 --> 01:01:14.310
B was supposed to be Hermitian.

01:01:14.310 --> 01:01:16.630
The expectation value is real.

01:01:16.630 --> 01:01:18.345
The time derivative is real.

01:01:18.345 --> 01:01:20.920
It could be going up or down.

01:01:20.920 --> 01:01:23.720
So at the end of
the day, you have

01:01:23.720 --> 01:01:30.620
delta H delta Q is greater
than or equal to H bar

01:01:30.620 --> 01:01:36.050
over 2, the absolute
value of dQ over dt.

01:01:43.910 --> 01:01:46.830
There we go.

01:01:46.830 --> 01:01:50.110
This is, in a sense,
the best you can do.

01:01:50.110 --> 01:01:55.550
Let's try to interpret
what we've got.

01:01:55.550 --> 01:01:59.580
Well, we've got something
that still doesn't quite

01:01:59.580 --> 01:02:02.720
look like a time
uncertainty relationship,

01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:04.980
but there's time in there.

01:02:04.980 --> 01:02:07.700
But it's a matter
of a definition now.

01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:22.410
You see, if you have delta Q,
and you divide it by dQ dt,

01:02:22.410 --> 01:02:26.030
first it is some sort of time.

01:02:26.030 --> 01:02:28.570
It has the units of time.

01:02:28.570 --> 01:02:32.900
And we can define it, if
you wish, to be sub delta t.

01:02:35.660 --> 01:02:41.620
And what physically, does
this delta t represent?

01:02:41.620 --> 01:02:46.190
Well, it's roughly-- you
see, things change in time.

01:02:46.190 --> 01:02:49.750
The rate of change of the
expectation value of Q

01:02:49.750 --> 01:02:51.090
may not be uniform.

01:02:51.090 --> 01:02:55.160
It make change fast, or
it may change slowly.

01:02:55.160 --> 01:02:58.990
But suppose it's changing.

01:02:58.990 --> 01:03:01.850
Roughly, this ratio, of
this would be constant,

01:03:01.850 --> 01:03:06.060
is the time it takes the
expectation value of Q

01:03:06.060 --> 01:03:12.730
to change by delta Q. It
is like a distance divided

01:03:12.730 --> 01:03:13.313
by a velocity.

01:03:16.710 --> 01:03:25.480
So this is roughly the time
needed for the expectation

01:03:25.480 --> 01:03:38.280
value of Q to change by
delta Q, by the uncertainty.

01:03:38.280 --> 01:03:40.740
So it's a measure
of the time needed

01:03:40.740 --> 01:03:48.930
for a significant change,
if the expectation

01:03:48.930 --> 01:03:53.180
value, if the uncertainty
of Q is significant, and is

01:03:53.180 --> 01:03:56.550
comparable to Q. Well,
this is the time needed

01:03:56.550 --> 01:03:59.220
for significant change.

01:03:59.220 --> 01:04:02.960
Now this is pretty much all you
can do, except that of course,

01:04:02.960 --> 01:04:05.980
once you write it like
that, you pull this down,

01:04:05.980 --> 01:04:10.670
and you go up now,
delta H delta t

01:04:10.670 --> 01:04:15.630
is greater or equal
than H bar over 2.

01:04:15.630 --> 01:04:23.530
And this is the best you can
do with this kind of approach.

01:04:23.530 --> 01:04:25.518
Yes?

01:04:25.518 --> 01:04:27.890
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:04:27.890 --> 01:04:31.290
PROFESSOR: Yeah, I
simply define this,

01:04:31.290 --> 01:04:35.180
which is a time that has
some meaning if you know what

01:04:35.180 --> 01:04:38.330
the uncertainty of the operator
is and how fast it's changing--

01:04:38.330 --> 01:04:41.310
is the time needed for a change.

01:04:41.310 --> 01:04:47.160
Once I defined this, I simply
brought this factor down here,

01:04:47.160 --> 01:04:51.210
so that delta Q over this
derivative is delta t,

01:04:51.210 --> 01:04:55.110
and the equation just
became this equation.

01:05:02.410 --> 01:05:07.120
So we'll try to figure out a
little more of what this means

01:05:07.120 --> 01:05:12.390
right away, but you can
make a few criticisms

01:05:12.390 --> 01:05:14.510
about this thing.

01:05:14.510 --> 01:05:17.380
You can say, look,
this delta time

01:05:17.380 --> 01:05:19.290
uncertainty is not universal.

01:05:19.290 --> 01:05:23.090
It depends which
operator Q you took.

01:05:23.090 --> 01:05:23.750
True enough.

01:05:26.440 --> 01:05:30.480
I cannot prove that it's
independent of the operator Q,

01:05:30.480 --> 01:05:34.440
and many times I cannot even
tell you which operator Q is

01:05:34.440 --> 01:05:37.880
the best operator
to think about.

01:05:37.880 --> 01:05:39.570
But you can try.

01:05:39.570 --> 01:05:42.600
And it does give
you-- first, it's

01:05:42.600 --> 01:05:47.660
a mathematical statement about
how fast things can change.

01:05:47.660 --> 01:05:54.080
And that contains physics, and
it contains a very precise fact

01:05:54.080 --> 01:05:54.580
as well.

01:05:57.490 --> 01:06:01.570
Actually, there's a version
of the uncertainty principle

01:06:01.570 --> 01:06:06.580
that you will explore in
the homework that is, maybe,

01:06:06.580 --> 01:06:12.130
an alternative picture of this,
and asks the following thing--

01:06:12.130 --> 01:06:15.630
if you have a state
and a stationary state,

01:06:15.630 --> 01:06:18.160
nothing changes in the state.

01:06:18.160 --> 01:06:21.880
But if it's a stationary
state, the energy uncertainty

01:06:21.880 --> 01:06:26.070
is 0, because the energy is
an eigenstate of the energy.

01:06:26.070 --> 01:06:27.750
So nothing changes.

01:06:27.750 --> 01:06:30.780
So you have to wait infinite
time for there to be a change,

01:06:30.780 --> 01:06:34.090
and this makes sense.

01:06:34.090 --> 01:06:36.860
Now you can ask the
following question-- suppose

01:06:36.860 --> 01:06:43.220
I have a state that is not
an eigenstate of energy.

01:06:43.220 --> 01:06:45.330
So therefore, for example,
the simplest thing

01:06:45.330 --> 01:06:47.624
would be a superposition
of two eigenstates

01:06:47.624 --> 01:06:48.540
of different energies.

01:06:51.100 --> 01:06:53.980
You can ask, well, there
will be time evolution

01:06:53.980 --> 01:06:57.710
and this state will
change in time.

01:06:57.710 --> 01:07:05.180
So how can I get a
constraint on changes?

01:07:05.180 --> 01:07:06.870
How can I approach changes?

01:07:06.870 --> 01:07:11.050
And people discovered the
following interesting fact--

01:07:11.050 --> 01:07:18.120
that if you have a state, it has
unit norm, and if it evolves,

01:07:18.120 --> 01:07:20.530
it may happen that
at some stage,

01:07:20.530 --> 01:07:24.320
it becomes orthogonal to
itself-- to the original one.

01:07:24.320 --> 01:07:26.150
And that is a big change.

01:07:26.150 --> 01:07:29.000
You become orthogonal
to what you used to be.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:32.400
That's as big a
change as can happen.

01:07:32.400 --> 01:07:37.350
And then you can ask,
is there a minimum time

01:07:37.350 --> 01:07:40.720
for which this can happen?

01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:42.830
What is the minimum
time in which

01:07:42.830 --> 01:07:46.410
a state can change
so much that it

01:07:46.410 --> 01:07:49.090
becomes orthogonal to itself?

01:07:49.090 --> 01:07:51.860
And there is such an
uncertainty principle.

01:07:51.860 --> 01:07:54.690
It's derived a little
differently from that.

01:07:54.690 --> 01:08:03.120
And it says that if you
take delta t to be the time

01:08:03.120 --> 01:08:23.760
it takes psi of x and t to
become orthogonal to psi of x0,

01:08:23.760 --> 01:08:28.638
then this delta
t times delta E--

01:08:28.638 --> 01:08:32.630
the uncertainty of the energies
is the uncertainty in h--

01:08:32.630 --> 01:08:37.494
is greater than or
equal to h bar over 4.

01:08:46.660 --> 01:08:50.040
Now a state may never
become orthogonal to itself,

01:08:50.040 --> 01:08:51.120
but that's OK.

01:08:51.120 --> 01:08:54.970
Then it's a big number
on the left-hand side.

01:08:54.970 --> 01:08:58.029
But the quickest it
can do it is that.

01:08:58.029 --> 01:09:00.540
And that's an interesting thing.

01:09:00.540 --> 01:09:02.650
And it's a version of the
uncertainty principle.

01:09:05.960 --> 01:09:08.270
I want to make a
couple more remarks,

01:09:08.270 --> 01:09:10.640
because this thing
is mysterious enough

01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:15.520
that it requires thinking.

01:09:15.520 --> 01:09:21.970
So let's make some precise
claims about energy

01:09:21.970 --> 01:09:26.550
uncertainties and then
give an example of what's

01:09:26.550 --> 01:09:29.439
happening in the
physical situation.

01:09:29.439 --> 01:09:30.720
Was there a question?

01:09:30.720 --> 01:09:33.095
Yes.

01:09:33.095 --> 01:09:33.970
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:09:33.970 --> 01:09:36.303
PROFESSOR: You're going to
explore that in the homework.

01:09:36.303 --> 01:09:39.752
Actually, I don't think
you're going to show it, but--

01:09:39.752 --> 01:09:41.642
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
H bar [INAUDIBLE]

01:09:41.642 --> 01:09:43.600
it's even less than the
uncertainty [INAUDIBLE]

01:09:49.776 --> 01:09:51.359
PROFESSOR: It's a
different statement.

01:09:51.359 --> 01:09:56.110
It's a very precise way of
measuring, creating a time.

01:09:56.110 --> 01:09:58.480
It's a precise
definition of time,

01:09:58.480 --> 01:10:02.054
and therefore,
there's no reason why

01:10:02.054 --> 01:10:03.220
it would have been the same.

01:10:07.280 --> 01:10:12.120
So here is a statement
that is interesting-- is

01:10:12.120 --> 01:10:27.740
that the uncertainty delta
E in an isolated system

01:10:27.740 --> 01:10:33.680
is constant-- doesn't change.

01:10:36.370 --> 01:10:39.770
And by an isolated
system, a system

01:10:39.770 --> 01:10:42.040
in which there's no
influences on it,

01:10:42.040 --> 01:10:47.900
a system in which you have
actually time independent

01:10:47.900 --> 01:10:48.920
Hamiltonians.

01:10:48.920 --> 01:10:56.030
So H is a time
independent Hamiltonian.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:04.370
Now that, of course, doesn't
mean the physics is boring.

01:11:04.370 --> 01:11:07.090
Time- independent Hamiltonians
are quite interesting,

01:11:07.090 --> 01:11:09.110
but you have a whole system.

01:11:09.110 --> 01:11:11.250
Let's take it to be isolated.

01:11:11.250 --> 01:11:14.050
There's no time dependent
things acting on it,

01:11:14.050 --> 01:11:18.880
and H should be a time
independent Hamiltonian.

01:11:18.880 --> 01:11:28.180
So I want to use
this statement to say

01:11:28.180 --> 01:11:32.170
the following--
if I take Q equals

01:11:32.170 --> 01:11:36.020
H in that theorem
over there, I get

01:11:36.020 --> 01:11:42.970
that d dt of the expectation
value of H would be what?

01:11:42.970 --> 01:11:45.480
It would be i over H bar.

01:11:45.480 --> 01:11:48.420
Since H is time
independent-- the condition

01:11:48.420 --> 01:11:50.700
here was that Q had
no time dependence.

01:11:50.700 --> 01:11:54.640
But then I get H
commutator with H.

01:11:54.640 --> 01:12:01.980
So I get here H commutator with
H. And that commutator is 0.

01:12:01.980 --> 01:12:07.230
However complicated an operator
is, it commutes with itself.

01:12:07.230 --> 01:12:13.150
So the expectation value of
the energy doesn't change.

01:12:13.150 --> 01:12:15.920
We call that energy
conservation.

01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:21.610
But still, if you take Q
now equal to H squared,

01:12:21.610 --> 01:12:25.790
the time derivative of
the expectation value of H

01:12:25.790 --> 01:12:29.760
squared, you get i over H bar.

01:12:29.760 --> 01:12:33.030
You're supposed to be
H commutator with Q,

01:12:33.030 --> 01:12:35.370
which is H squared, now.

01:12:35.370 --> 01:12:36.555
And that's also 0.

01:12:40.290 --> 01:12:46.550
So no power of the expectation
value of H vanishes.

01:12:46.550 --> 01:12:52.310
And therefore, we have
that the time derivative

01:12:52.310 --> 01:12:56.580
of the uncertainty
of H squared--

01:12:56.580 --> 01:13:01.300
which is the time derivative
of the expectation value of H

01:13:01.300 --> 01:13:06.270
squared minus the expectation
value of H squared-- well,

01:13:06.270 --> 01:13:10.490
we've shown each one of the
things on the right-hand side

01:13:10.490 --> 01:13:14.670
are 0, so this is 0.

01:13:14.670 --> 01:13:18.070
So delta H is constant.

01:13:25.650 --> 01:13:32.910
So the uncertainty-- delta
E or delta H of the system

01:13:32.910 --> 01:13:35.340
is constant.

01:13:35.340 --> 01:13:38.310
So what do we do with that?

01:13:38.310 --> 01:13:44.480
Well it helps us think a little
about time dependent processes.

01:13:44.480 --> 01:13:48.420
And the example we
must have in mind

01:13:48.420 --> 01:13:52.220
is perhaps the one
of a decay that

01:13:52.220 --> 01:13:57.010
leads to a radiation of
a photon, so a transition

01:13:57.010 --> 01:14:00.140
that leads to a
photon radiation.

01:14:00.140 --> 01:14:03.096
So let's consider that example.

01:14:08.900 --> 01:14:12.460
So we have an atom in
some excited state,

01:14:12.460 --> 01:14:16.020
decays to the ground state
and shoots out the photon.

01:14:28.340 --> 01:14:41.320
Then it's an unstable state,
because if it would be stable,

01:14:41.320 --> 01:14:44.190
it wouldn't change in time.

01:14:44.190 --> 01:14:47.300
And the excited state of an
atom is an unstable state,

01:14:47.300 --> 01:14:49.505
decays into-- goes
into the ground state.

01:14:55.590 --> 01:14:56.680
And it makes a photon.

01:15:02.090 --> 01:15:07.190
Now this idea of
the conservation

01:15:07.190 --> 01:15:12.980
of energy uncertainty at least
helps you in this situation

01:15:12.980 --> 01:15:16.610
that you would typically do
it with a lot of hand-waving,

01:15:16.610 --> 01:15:18.740
organize your thoughts.

01:15:18.740 --> 01:15:23.230
So what happens in such decay?

01:15:23.230 --> 01:15:34.090
There's a lifetime, which
is a typical time you

01:15:34.090 --> 01:15:38.480
have to wait for that
excited state to decay.

01:15:38.480 --> 01:15:41.590
And these lifetime
is called tau.

01:15:41.590 --> 01:15:45.830
And certainly as the
lifetime goes through,

01:15:45.830 --> 01:15:51.250
and the decay happens, some
observable changes a lot.

01:15:51.250 --> 01:15:53.950
Some observable Q
must change a lot.

01:15:53.950 --> 01:15:57.940
Maybe a position of the
electron in an orbit,

01:15:57.940 --> 01:16:02.480
or the angular momentum
of it, or some squared

01:16:02.480 --> 01:16:05.330
of the momentum--
some observable

01:16:05.330 --> 01:16:10.030
that we could do an atomic
calculation in more detail

01:16:10.030 --> 01:16:11.460
must change a lot.

01:16:11.460 --> 01:16:15.280
So there will be associated
with some observable that

01:16:15.280 --> 01:16:18.680
changes a lot
during the lifetime,

01:16:18.680 --> 01:16:23.140
because it takes that long
for this thing to change.

01:16:23.140 --> 01:16:26.150
There will be an
energy uncertainty

01:16:26.150 --> 01:16:28.130
associated to a lifetime.

01:16:28.130 --> 01:16:32.340
So how does the energy
uncertainty reflect itself?

01:16:32.340 --> 01:16:33.975
Well, you have a ground state.

01:16:38.830 --> 01:16:40.830
And you have this excited state.

01:16:40.830 --> 01:16:44.650
But generally, when you
have an excited state

01:16:44.650 --> 01:16:48.320
due to some interactions
that produce instability,

01:16:48.320 --> 01:16:52.380
you actually have a
lot of states here

01:16:52.380 --> 01:16:55.040
that are part of
the excited state.

01:16:55.040 --> 01:17:00.370
So you have an excited
state, but you do have,

01:17:00.370 --> 01:17:03.290
typically, a lot of
uncertainty-- but not

01:17:03.290 --> 01:17:06.380
a lot-- some uncertainty
of the energy here.

01:17:06.380 --> 01:17:09.140
The state is not
a particular one.

01:17:09.140 --> 01:17:10.865
If it would be a
particular one, it

01:17:10.865 --> 01:17:14.790
would be a stationary state--
would stay there forever.

01:17:14.790 --> 01:17:18.280
Nevertheless, it's a
combination of some things,

01:17:18.280 --> 01:17:20.630
so it's not quite
a stationary state.

01:17:20.630 --> 01:17:22.440
It couldn't be a
stationary state,

01:17:22.440 --> 01:17:24.160
because it would be eternal.

01:17:24.160 --> 01:17:27.580
So somehow, the
dynamics of this atom

01:17:27.580 --> 01:17:31.625
must be such that there's
interactions between, say,

01:17:31.625 --> 01:17:36.850
the electron and the nucleus, or
possibly a radiation field that

01:17:36.850 --> 01:17:43.660
makes the state of
this electron unstable,

01:17:43.660 --> 01:17:47.680
and associated to it an
uncertainty in the energy.

01:17:47.680 --> 01:17:52.510
So there's an uncertainty
here, and this particle--

01:17:52.510 --> 01:17:56.040
this electron goes eventually
to the ground state,

01:17:56.040 --> 01:17:57.270
and it meets a photon.

01:18:03.130 --> 01:18:09.670
So there is, associated to this
lifetime, an uncertainty delta

01:18:09.670 --> 01:18:18.390
E times tau, and I will put
similar to H bar over 2.

01:18:18.390 --> 01:18:24.060
And this would be
the delta E here,

01:18:24.060 --> 01:18:26.430
because your state
must be a superposition

01:18:26.430 --> 01:18:28.880
of some states over there.

01:18:28.880 --> 01:18:31.740
And then what happens later?

01:18:31.740 --> 01:18:34.360
Well, this particle goes
to the ground state--

01:18:34.360 --> 01:18:40.060
no uncertainty any more
about what its energy is.

01:18:40.060 --> 01:18:42.670
So the only possibility
at this moment

01:18:42.670 --> 01:18:47.320
consistent with the conservation
of uncertainty in the system

01:18:47.320 --> 01:18:49.780
is that the photon
carries the uncertainty.

01:18:49.780 --> 01:18:54.120
So that photon must have
an uncertainty as well.

01:18:54.120 --> 01:19:00.020
So delta energy
of the photon will

01:19:00.020 --> 01:19:09.470
be equal to h bar delta
omega, or h delta nu.

01:19:17.220 --> 01:19:23.230
So the end result is that
in a physical decay process,

01:19:23.230 --> 01:19:24.230
there are uncertainties.

01:19:24.230 --> 01:19:27.700
And the uncertainty
gets carried out,

01:19:27.700 --> 01:19:30.970
and it's always there--
the delta E here

01:19:30.970 --> 01:19:34.170
and the photon having
some uncertainty.

01:19:34.170 --> 01:19:38.820
Now one of the most famous
applications of this thing

01:19:38.820 --> 01:19:42.570
is related to the hyperfine
transition of hydrogen.

01:19:42.570 --> 01:19:45.750
And we're very lucky in physics.

01:19:45.750 --> 01:19:47.210
Physicists are very lucky.

01:19:47.210 --> 01:19:52.220
This is a great break for
astronomy and cosmology,

01:19:52.220 --> 01:19:56.370
and it's all based on this
uncertainty principle.

01:19:56.370 --> 01:20:06.440
You have the hyperfine
transition of hydrogen.

01:20:09.510 --> 01:20:12.960
So we will study
later in this course

01:20:12.960 --> 01:20:18.430
that because of the
proton and electron

01:20:18.430 --> 01:20:21.300
spins in the hydrogen
atom, there's

01:20:21.300 --> 01:20:24.330
a splitting of
energies having to do

01:20:24.330 --> 01:20:26.280
with the hyperfine interaction.

01:20:26.280 --> 01:20:29.120
It's a magnetic
dipole interaction

01:20:29.120 --> 01:20:31.560
between the proton
and the electron.

01:20:31.560 --> 01:20:34.380
And there's going
to be a splitting.

01:20:34.380 --> 01:20:38.510
And there's a transition
associated with this splitting.

01:20:38.510 --> 01:20:42.160
So there's a hyperfine
splitting-- the ground state

01:20:42.160 --> 01:20:45.270
of the hyperfine
splitting of some states.

01:20:45.270 --> 01:20:49.360
And it's the top state
and the bottom state.

01:20:49.360 --> 01:20:54.940
And as the system decays,
it emits a photon.

01:20:54.940 --> 01:21:03.220
This photon is approximately
a 21 centimeter wavelength--

01:21:03.220 --> 01:21:07.140
is the famous 21 centimeter
line of hydrogen.

01:21:07.140 --> 01:21:15.740
And it corresponds to
about 1420 megahertz.

01:21:15.740 --> 01:21:20.150
So how about so far so good.

01:21:20.150 --> 01:21:23.960
There's an energy
splitting here,

01:21:23.960 --> 01:21:30.670
21 centimeters wavelength,
5.9 times 10 to the minus 6

01:21:30.670 --> 01:21:34.110
eV in here.

01:21:34.110 --> 01:21:37.150
But that's not the
energy difference

01:21:37.150 --> 01:21:39.130
that matters for
the uncertainty,

01:21:39.130 --> 01:21:41.580
just like this is not the
energy difference that

01:21:41.580 --> 01:21:43.250
matters for the uncertainty.

01:21:43.250 --> 01:21:47.370
What matters for the uncertainty
is how broad this state

01:21:47.370 --> 01:21:51.630
is, due to interactions
that will produce the decay.

01:21:51.630 --> 01:21:55.120
It's a very funny,
magnetic transition.

01:21:55.120 --> 01:21:58.630
And how long is the
lifetime of this state?

01:21:58.630 --> 01:22:02.018
Anybody know?

01:22:02.018 --> 01:22:09.410
A second, a millisecond, a day?

01:22:09.410 --> 01:22:09.910
Nobody?

01:22:14.580 --> 01:22:26.230
Ten million years-- a long
time-- 10 million years--

01:22:26.230 --> 01:22:27.930
lifetime tau.

01:22:27.930 --> 01:22:33.510
A year is about pi times
10 to the 7 seconds

01:22:33.510 --> 01:22:34.370
is pretty accurate.

01:22:38.410 --> 01:22:42.150
Anyway, 10 million
years is a lot of time.

01:22:42.150 --> 01:22:45.410
It's such a large time
that it corresponds

01:22:45.410 --> 01:22:50.540
to an energy uncertainty
that is so extraordinarily

01:22:50.540 --> 01:22:54.930
small, that the wavelength
uncertainty, or the frequency

01:22:54.930 --> 01:23:00.880
uncertainty, is so small that
corresponding to this 1420,

01:23:00.880 --> 01:23:04.770
it's I think, the uncertainty
in lambda-- and lambda

01:23:04.770 --> 01:23:09.250
is of the order of
10 to the minus 8.

01:23:09.250 --> 01:23:14.190
The line is extremely sharp,
so it's not a fussy line

01:23:14.190 --> 01:23:16.050
that it's hard to measure.

01:23:16.050 --> 01:23:19.280
It's the sharpest possible line.

01:23:19.280 --> 01:23:24.260
And it's so sharp because of
this 10 million years lifetime,

01:23:24.260 --> 01:23:27.360
and the energy time
uncertainty relationship.

01:23:27.360 --> 01:23:29.590
That's it for today.

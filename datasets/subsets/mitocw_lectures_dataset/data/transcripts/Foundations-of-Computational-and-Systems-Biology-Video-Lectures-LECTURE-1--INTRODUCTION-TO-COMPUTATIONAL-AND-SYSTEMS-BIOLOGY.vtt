00:00:26.225 --> 00:00:27.600
PROFESSOR: Welcome
to Foundations

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.330
of Computational
and Systems Biology.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.030
This course has many numbers.

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:35.410
We'll explain all the
differences and similarities.

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.540
But briefly, there are three
undergrad course numbers,

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.770
which are all similar in
content, 7.36, 20.390, 6.802.

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:49.470
And then, there are
four graduate versions.

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:55.410
The 7.91, 20.490, and HST
versions are all very similar,

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.030
basically identical.

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.245
But the 6.874 has some
additional AI content

00:01:01.245 --> 00:01:04.420
that we'll discuss in a moment.

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.720
So make sure that
you are registered

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.160
for the appropriate
version of this course.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.710
And please interrupt with
questions at any time.

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:22.260
The main goal today is to give
an overview of the course, both

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.420
the content as well as
the mechanics of how

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.503
the course will be taught.

00:01:25.503 --> 00:01:28.310
And we want to make sure
that everything is clear.

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.070
So this course is
taught by myself

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.135
and Chris Burge from Biology,
Professor Fraenkel from BE,

00:01:35.135 --> 00:01:38.960
and Professor Gifford from EECS.

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:45.450
We have three TAs, Peter
Freese and Collette Picard,

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:51.570
from Computational and Systems
Biology, and Tahin, from EECS.

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.620
All the TAs have expertise
in computational biology

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:59.480
as well as other
quantitative areas

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.429
like math, statistics,
computer science.

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:04.845
So in addition to the lectures
by the regular instructors,

00:02:04.845 --> 00:02:09.320
we will also have guest
lectures by George Church,

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:12.640
from Harvard, toward
the end of the semester.

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.640
Doug Lauffenburger
will give a lecture

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.530
in the regulatory network
section of the course.

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.350
And we'll have a guest
lecture from Ron Weiss

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.220
on synthetic biology.

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.770
And just a note
that today's lecture

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.580
and all the lectures
this semester

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.950
are being recorded by AMPS,
by MIT's OpenCourseWare.

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.850
So the videos, after a
little bit of editing,

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.972
will eventually end
up on OpenCourseWare.

00:02:38.972 --> 00:02:39.930
What are these courses?

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:45.860
So these course numbers are
the graduate level versions,

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.170
which are survey courses
in computational biology.

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.310
Our target audience
is graduate students

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.935
who have a solid
background and comfort--

00:02:54.935 --> 00:02:56.740
or, a solid
background in biology,

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:01.130
and also, a comfort with
quantitative approaches.

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.230
We don't assume that
you've programmed before,

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.200
but there will be
some programming

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.970
content on the homeworks.

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:12.430
And you will therefore need to
learn some Python programming.

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.180
And the TAs will help with
that component of the course.

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.240
We also have some online
tutorials on Python programming

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:22.210
that are available.

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:24.830
The undergrad course
numbers-- this

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:26.940
is an upper level
undergraduate survey

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.730
course in computational biology.

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:33.200
And our target audience are
upper level undergraduates

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.182
with solid biology
background and comfort

00:03:35.182 --> 00:03:36.390
with quantitative approaches.

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:39.350
So there's one key difference
between the graduate

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:42.540
and undergraduate versions,
which I'll come to in a moment.

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.600
So the goal of this course
is to develop understanding

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.070
of foundational methods in
computational biology that

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:53.490
will enable you to
contextualize and understand

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:55.990
a good portion of research
literature in a growing field.

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:58.922
So if you pick up Science, or
Nature, or PLOS Computational

00:03:58.922 --> 00:04:03.780
Biology and you want
to read those papers

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.500
and understand them,
after this course,

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:06.960
you will have a better chance.

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:09.770
We're not guaranteeing you'll be
able to understand all of them.

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:15.480
But you'll be able to recognize,
perhaps, the category of paper,

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.850
the class, and perhaps,
some of the algorithms

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:20.579
that are involved.

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:23.940
And for the graduate
version, another goal

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:27.350
is to help you gain exposure
to research in this field.

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:30.440
So it's actually
possible to do a smaller

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.820
scale computational biology
research project on your own,

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:36.700
on your laptop-- perhaps,
on ATHENA-- with relatively

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:39.840
limited computational
resources and potentially

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.190
even discover something new.

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:44.720
And so we want to give
you that experience.

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:47.110
And that's through
the project component

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:49.400
that we'll say more
about in a moment.

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.860
So just to make sure that
everyone's in the right class--

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.840
this is not a systems
biology class.

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:57.340
There are some more
focused systems

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:58.900
biology classes
offered on campus.

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:01.380
But we will cover
some topics that

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:04.390
are important for
analyzing complex systems.

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:08.170
This is also certainly not
a synthetic biology course.

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:12.050
Some of the systems methods are
also used in synthetic biology.

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:14.430
And there will be this
guest lecturer I mentioned,

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:18.030
Ron Weiss, which will
cover synthetic biology.

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:20.140
It's also not an
algorithms class.

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:22.880
We don't assume that
you have experience

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.290
in designing or
analyzing algorithms.

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:28.220
We'll discuss various
bioinformatics algorithms.

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:30.830
And you'll have the
opportunity to implement

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:36.050
at least one bioinformatics
algorithm on your homework.

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:39.910
But algorithms and not really
the center of the course.

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:41.620
And there's one
exception to this,

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:44.670
which is, those of you
who are taking 6.874

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:46.480
will go to a special
recitation that

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:50.350
will cover more advanced
algorithm content.

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:53.190
And there will be special
homework problems for you

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:53.690
as well.

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:58.240
So that course really does
have more algorithm content.

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:00.280
So the plan for today
is that I will just

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:03.750
do a brief, anecdotal history
of computational and systems

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:04.250
biology.

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:07.770
This is to set the stage and
the context for the class.

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:10.620
And then we'll spend
a significant amount

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:14.600
of time reviewing the course
mechanics, organization,

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:15.130
and content.

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:17.730
Because as you'll see, it's
a little bit complicated.

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:22.560
But it'll make sense once
we go over it, hopefully.

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:26.660
So this is my take
on computational

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:27.650
and systems biology.

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:29.910
Again, it's not a
scholarly overview.

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:32.770
It doesn't hit everything
important that happened.

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:35.870
It just gives you
a flavor of what

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:41.860
was happening in computational
biology decade by decade.

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:46.060
So first of all,
where does this field

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:49.470
fall in the academic
scheme of things?

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:53.110
So I consider
computational biology

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:55.550
to be actually part of biology.

00:06:55.550 --> 00:07:01.110
So in the way that genetics or
biochemistry are disciplines

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:03.920
that have strategies
for understanding

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:07.080
biological questions, so
does computational biology.

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:09.210
You can use it to
understand a variety

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:10.790
of computational
questions in gene

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:15.000
regulation, many other areas.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.430
There is also, some
people make a distinction

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:21.500
that bioinformatics is
more about building tools

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:25.811
whereas computational biology
is more about using tools,

00:07:25.811 --> 00:07:26.310
for example.

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:29.130
Although many people
don't-- it's very blurry--

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:33.199
and don't try to-- people
use them in various ways.

00:07:33.199 --> 00:07:34.990
And then, you could
think of bioinformatics

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:39.280
as being embedded in the larger
field of informatics, where you

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:43.340
include tools for management
and analysis of data in general.

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:47.570
And it's certainly true that
many of the core concepts

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:51.170
and algorithms in bioinformatics
come from the field,

00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:53.980
come from computer science,
come from other branches

00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:57.710
of engineering, from statistics,
mathematics, and so forth.

00:07:57.710 --> 00:07:59.710
So it's really a cross
disciplinary field.

00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:03.120
And then, synthetic biology
cuts across in the sense

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:05.404
that it's really an
engineering discipline.

00:08:05.404 --> 00:08:07.070
Because you're designing
and engineering

00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:09.820
synthetic molecular
cellular systems.

00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:11.700
But you can also use
synthetic biology

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:16.220
to help understand natural
biological systems, of course.

00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:19.030
All right, so what was
happening, decade by decade?

00:08:19.030 --> 00:08:22.910
So in the '70s, there
were not genome sequences

00:08:22.910 --> 00:08:26.027
available or large sequence
databases of any sort.

00:08:26.027 --> 00:08:28.360
Except there were starting
to be some protein sequences.

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:31.030
And early computational
biologists

00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:36.440
focused on comparing proteins,
understanding their function,

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:38.419
structure, and evolution.

00:08:38.419 --> 00:08:40.840
And so in order to
compare proteins,

00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:44.810
you need a protein-- an amino
acid substitution matrix--

00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:47.730
a matrix that describes
how often one amino acid is

00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:48.750
substituted for another.

00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:50.990
And Margaret Dayhoff
was a pioneer

00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:52.630
in developing these
sorts of matrices.

00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:55.980
And some of the matrices she
developed, the PAM series,

00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:56.870
are still used today.

00:08:56.870 --> 00:09:00.720
And we'll discuss those
matrices early next week.

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:04.310
So in terms of asking
evolutionary questions,

00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:09.400
two big thinkers were Russ
Doolittle and Carl Woese,

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:14.930
analyzing both ribosomal RNA
sequences to study evolution.

00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:18.780
And Carl Woese realized,
looking at these RNA alignments,

00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:21.777
that actually, the prokaryotes,
which had been-- there

00:09:21.777 --> 00:09:23.360
was this big split
between prokaryotes

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:25.530
and eukaryotes was
sort of a false split--

00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:27.430
that actually,
there was a subgroup

00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:30.750
of single-celled
anuclear organisms

00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:32.520
that were closer
to the eukaryotes--

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:33.740
and named them the Archaea.

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:36.890
So a whole kingdom of life
was recognized, really,

00:09:36.890 --> 00:09:38.350
by sequence analysis.

00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:42.040
And Russ Doolittle also
did a lot of analysis

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:45.030
approaching sequences and came
up with this molecular clock

00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:48.860
idea, or contributed
to that idea,

00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:52.390
to actually build-- instead
of systematics being based

00:09:52.390 --> 00:09:57.770
on phenotypic characteristics,
do it on a molecular level.

00:09:57.770 --> 00:10:00.780
So in the '80s, the
databases started to expand.

00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:04.000
Sequence alignment and
search became more important.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.830
And various people
developed fast algorithms

00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:12.530
to compare protein and DNA
sequences and align them.

00:10:12.530 --> 00:10:15.430
So the FASTA program
was widely used.

00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:17.820
BLAST-- several of the authors
of BLAST are shown here--

00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:21.580
David Lipman, Pearson, Webb
Miller, Stephen Altschul.

00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:25.610
The statistics for knowing
when a BLAST search result is

00:10:25.610 --> 00:10:28.110
significant were developed
by Karlin and Altschul.

00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:31.505
And there was also progress
in gapped alignment,

00:10:31.505 --> 00:10:35.340
in particularly,
Smith-Waterman, shown above.

00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:37.700
Also progress in RNA
secondary structure prediction

00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:40.140
from Nusinov and Zuker.

00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:44.730
We'll talk about all of these
algorithms during the course.

00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:48.100
And there was also development
of literature databases.

00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:49.665
I always liked this picture.

00:10:49.665 --> 00:10:51.040
Many of you probably
used PubMed.

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:56.400
But Al Gore was well coached
here, by these experts,

00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:57.530
in how to use it.

00:10:57.530 --> 00:11:01.480
And then, in the '90s,
computational biology

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:02.736
really started to expand.

00:11:02.736 --> 00:11:04.360
It was driven partly
by the development

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:09.540
of a microarrays, the first
genome sequences, and questions

00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:12.030
like how to identify
domains in a protein,

00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:15.520
how to identify
genes in the genome.

00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:18.340
It was recognized that
this family of models

00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:22.260
from electrical engineering,
the hidden Markov model,

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:25.780
were quite useful for these sort
of sequence labeling problems.

00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:28.800
That was really pioneered
by Anders Krogh here,

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:30.220
and David Haussler.

00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:32.700
And a variety of
algorithms were developed

00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:36.610
that performed
these useful tasks.

00:11:36.610 --> 00:11:39.150
There was also
important progress

00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:43.630
in the earliest comparative
genomic approaches,

00:11:43.630 --> 00:11:45.475
since you have--
the first genomes

00:11:45.475 --> 00:11:47.870
were sequenced in the mid
'90s, of free living organisms.

00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:50.510
And so you could then start
to compare these genomes

00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:51.350
and learn a lot.

00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:54.040
We'll talk a little bit
about comparative genomics.

00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:59.180
And there was important progress
on predicting protein structure

00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:00.950
from primary sequence.

00:12:00.950 --> 00:12:03.220
Particularly, David Baker
made notable progress

00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:05.190
on this Rosetta algorithm.

00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:07.750
So it's a biophysics
field, but it's

00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:12.310
very much part of
computational biology as well.

00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:17.380
So in the 2000s, definitely,
genome sequencing

00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:21.370
became very fashionable,
as you can see here.

00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:28.030
And the genomes of
now larger organisms,

00:12:28.030 --> 00:12:31.450
including human, it became
possible to sequence them.

00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:33.540
And then, this
introduced a huge host

00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:36.849
of computational challenges
in assembling the genomes,

00:12:36.849 --> 00:12:38.390
annotating the
genomes, and so forth.

00:12:38.390 --> 00:12:41.510
And we'll hear from
Professor Gifford

00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:44.510
about some genome
assembly topics.

00:12:44.510 --> 00:12:47.750
And annotation will
come up throughout.

00:12:51.014 --> 00:12:52.430
Actually, let's
just mention, this

00:12:52.430 --> 00:12:56.779
is Jim Kent, who's the guru
who did the first human genome

00:12:56.779 --> 00:12:58.570
assembly-- at least,
that was widely used--

00:12:58.570 --> 00:13:00.950
and also was involved in UCSC.

00:13:00.950 --> 00:13:05.810
And here, Ewan Birney
has started Ensembl

00:13:05.810 --> 00:13:08.904
and continues to run it today.

00:13:08.904 --> 00:13:10.820
You know who these other
people are, probably.

00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:11.830
OK.

00:13:11.830 --> 00:13:12.330
All right.

00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:19.200
So in another phase
of the last decade,

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:24.070
I would say that much
of biological research

00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:27.570
became more high throughput
than it was before.

00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:29.270
So molecular biology
had traditionally,

00:13:29.270 --> 00:13:31.670
in the '80s and
'90s, mostly focused

00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:35.420
on analysis of individual
gene or protein products.

00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:38.970
But now it became possible,
and in widespread use,

00:13:38.970 --> 00:13:42.380
that you could measure the
expression of all the genes,

00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:45.270
in theory-- using
microarrays, for example--

00:13:45.270 --> 00:13:48.330
and you could start
to profile all

00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:49.900
of the transcripts
in the cell, all

00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:53.670
of the proteins in the
cell, and so forth.

00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:55.690
And then, a variety
of groups started

00:13:55.690 --> 00:13:57.510
to use some of these
high throughput data

00:13:57.510 --> 00:14:00.850
to study various challenges
in gene expression

00:14:00.850 --> 00:14:04.710
to understand how transcription
works, how splicing works,

00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:07.940
how microRNAs work, translation,
epigenetics, and so forth.

00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:14.920
And you'll hear updates on some
of that work in this course.

00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:17.000
Bioimage informatics,
particularly

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:21.000
for developmental
biology, became popular.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:25.230
It continues to be
a new emerging area.

00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:31.980
Systems biology was also really
born around 2000, roughly.

00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:35.610
A very prominent example
would be the development

00:14:35.610 --> 00:14:38.890
of the first gene
regulatory network

00:14:38.890 --> 00:14:43.020
models that describe sea urchin
development, here, my Eric

00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:48.565
Davidson, as well as a whole
variety of models of other gene

00:14:48.565 --> 00:14:50.510
networks in the cell
that control things like

00:14:50.510 --> 00:14:53.990
cell proliferation,
apoptosis, et cetera.

00:14:56.660 --> 00:15:01.450
At the same time, a new
field of synthetic biology

00:15:01.450 --> 00:15:05.470
was born with the development
of some of the first

00:15:05.470 --> 00:15:09.610
completely artificial gene
networks that would then

00:15:09.610 --> 00:15:14.220
program cells to perform
desired behavior.

00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:16.810
So an example would be this
so-called repressilator,

00:15:16.810 --> 00:15:20.050
where you have a network of
three transcription factors.

00:15:20.050 --> 00:15:22.100
Each represses the other.

00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:24.127
And then, one of
them represses GFP.

00:15:24.127 --> 00:15:25.460
And you put these into bacteria.

00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:29.740
And it causes oscillations
in GFP, expressions

00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:33.400
that are described by these
differential equations here.

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:36.856
And some of the
modeling approaches

00:15:36.856 --> 00:15:38.230
used in synthetic
biology will be

00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:43.910
covered by Professor Fraenkel
and Lauffenburger later.

00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:44.410
All right.

00:15:44.410 --> 00:15:48.840
So late 2000s, early
2010s, it's still too early

00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:53.130
to say, for sure, what the most
important developments will be.

00:15:53.130 --> 00:15:57.020
But certainly, in
the late 2000s,

00:15:57.020 --> 00:15:59.020
next gen sequencing--
which now probably

00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:00.936
should be called second
generation sequencing,

00:16:00.936 --> 00:16:04.280
since there may be
future generations--

00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:08.980
really started to transform
a whole wide variety

00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:12.927
of applications in biology,
from making genome sequencing--

00:16:12.927 --> 00:16:15.010
instead of having to be
done in the genome center,

00:16:15.010 --> 00:16:18.640
now an individual lab can easily
do microbial genome sequencing.

00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:21.560
And when needed,
it's possible, also,

00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:25.140
to do genome sequencing
of larger organisms.

00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:28.850
Transcriptome sequencing
is now routine.

00:16:28.850 --> 00:16:31.290
We'll hear about that.

00:16:31.290 --> 00:16:34.550
There are applications
for mapping protein-DNA

00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:36.510
interactions genome
wide, including

00:16:36.510 --> 00:16:38.750
both sequence specific
transcription factors

00:16:38.750 --> 00:16:41.710
as well as more general
factors like histones,

00:16:41.710 --> 00:16:43.930
protein-RNA interactions--
a method called

00:16:43.930 --> 00:16:47.860
CLIP-Seq-- methods for mapping
all the translated messages,

00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:51.320
the methylated sites in
the genome, open chromatin,

00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:52.730
and so forth.

00:16:52.730 --> 00:16:55.250
So many people contributed
to this, obviously.

00:16:55.250 --> 00:16:57.530
I'm just mentioning,
Barbara Wold

00:16:57.530 --> 00:17:03.240
was a pioneer in both
RNA-Seq as well as ChIP-Seq.

00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:07.380
And some of the sequencing
technologies that came out here

00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:09.390
are shown here.

00:17:09.390 --> 00:17:12.800
And we will discuss those
at the beginning of lecture

00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:13.960
on Thursday.

00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:16.089
So I encourage you to
read this review here,

00:17:16.089 --> 00:17:19.990
by Metzger, which covers
many of the newer sequencing

00:17:19.990 --> 00:17:21.219
technologies.

00:17:21.219 --> 00:17:22.510
And they're pretty interesting.

00:17:22.510 --> 00:17:24.800
As you'll see, there's
some interesting tricks,

00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:29.600
interesting chemistry and
image analysis tricks.

00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:30.100
All right.

00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:33.540
So that was not very scholarly.

00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:37.960
But if you want a proper
history, then this guy,

00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:41.120
Hallam Stevens, who was a
History of Science PhD student

00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:43.150
at Harvard and
recently graduated,

00:17:43.150 --> 00:17:46.250
wrote this history
of bioinformatics.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:49.910
OK.

00:17:49.910 --> 00:17:51.290
So let's look at the syllabus.

00:17:51.290 --> 00:17:55.665
So also posted on the
[INAUDIBLE] site is a syllabus.

00:17:55.665 --> 00:17:57.430
It looks like this.

00:17:57.430 --> 00:18:00.430
This is quite an
information-rich document.

00:18:00.430 --> 00:18:03.280
It has all the lecture
titles, all the due dates

00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:04.940
of all the problem
sets, and so forth.

00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:08.710
So please print yourself a
copy and familiarize yourself

00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:09.510
with it.

00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:13.270
So we'll just try to
look at a high level

00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:15.920
first, and then zoom
in to the details.

00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:20.600
So at a high level, if you
look in this column here,

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:25.681
we've broken the course
into six different topics.

00:18:25.681 --> 00:18:26.180
OK?

00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:29.430
So there's Genomic
Analysis I, that I'll

00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:34.080
be teaching, which is more
classical computational

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:38.980
biology, you could say-- local
alignment, global alignment,

00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:39.910
and so forth.

00:18:39.910 --> 00:18:42.295
Then, Genomic Analysis II,
which Professor Gifford will

00:18:42.295 --> 00:18:44.770
be teaching, covers
some newer methods

00:18:44.770 --> 00:18:46.390
that are required
when you're doing

00:18:46.390 --> 00:18:49.580
a lot of second
generation sequencing--

00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:51.550
the standard algorithms
are not fast enough,

00:18:51.550 --> 00:18:55.960
you need better
algorithms, and so forth.

00:18:55.960 --> 00:19:02.180
And then, I will come back and
give a few lectures on modeling

00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:03.300
biological function.

00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:06.630
This will have to do with
sequence motifs, hidden Markov

00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:09.217
models, and RNA
secondary structure.

00:19:09.217 --> 00:19:10.800
Professor Fraenkel
will then do a unit

00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:13.190
on proteomics and
protein structure.

00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:16.080
And then, there will
be an extended unit

00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:17.777
on regulatory networks.

00:19:17.777 --> 00:19:19.360
Different types of
regulatory networks

00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:24.480
will be covered, with most
of the lectures by Ernest,

00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:27.020
one by David, and one by Doug.

00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:30.660
And then, we'll finish up
with computational genetics,

00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:32.440
by David.

00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:37.380
And there will also be some
guest lecturers, one of them

00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:39.180
interspersed in
regulatory networks,

00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:43.780
and then two at the end, from
Ron Weiss and George Church.

00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:49.090
So I just wanted to point out
that in all of these topics,

00:19:49.090 --> 00:19:52.299
we will include some discussion
of motivating question.

00:19:52.299 --> 00:19:53.840
So, what are the
biological questions

00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:56.760
that we're seeking to address
with these approaches.

00:19:56.760 --> 00:19:59.590
And there will also
be some discussion

00:19:59.590 --> 00:20:00.990
of the experimental method.

00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:02.940
So for example,
in the first unit,

00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:04.640
it's heavy on sequence analysis.

00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:08.240
So we'll talk about
how sequencing is done,

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:12.440
and then, quite a bit
about the interaction

00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:14.810
between the
experimental technology

00:20:14.810 --> 00:20:18.630
and the computational
analysis, which often involves

00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:20.470
statistical methods for
estimating the error

00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:23.740
rate of the experimental
method, and things like that.

00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:25.690
So the emphasis is on
the computational part,

00:20:25.690 --> 00:20:31.751
but we'll have some
discussion about experiments.

00:20:31.751 --> 00:20:32.750
Everyone with me so far?

00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:33.590
Any questions?

00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:39.290
OK.

00:20:39.290 --> 00:20:40.090
All right.

00:20:40.090 --> 00:20:42.050
So what are some of these
motivating questions

00:20:42.050 --> 00:20:43.216
that we'll be talking about?

00:20:43.216 --> 00:20:48.560
So what are the instructions
encoded in our genomes?

00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:50.760
You can think of the
genome as a book.

00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:52.610
But it's in this very
strange language.

00:20:52.610 --> 00:20:57.450
And we need to understand the
rules, the code that underlies

00:20:57.450 --> 00:21:01.730
a lot of research
in gene expression.

00:21:01.730 --> 00:21:03.640
How are chromosomes organized?

00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:07.840
What genes are present-- so
tools for annotating genomes.

00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:10.220
What regulatory
circuitry is encoded?

00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:13.470
You'd like to be able to
eventually look at a genome,

00:21:13.470 --> 00:21:15.590
understand all the
regulatory elements,

00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:18.960
and be able to predict
that there's some feedback

00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:23.650
circuit there that responds to--
a particular stimulation that

00:21:23.650 --> 00:21:26.360
responds to light, or
nutrient deprivation,

00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:28.195
or whatever it might be.

00:21:28.195 --> 00:21:30.320
Can the transcriptome be
predicted from the genome?

00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:33.040
This is a longstanding question.

00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:37.220
The translatome, if you
will-- well, let's say,

00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:40.670
the proteome can be predicted
from the transcriptome

00:21:40.670 --> 00:21:43.570
in the sense that we
have a genetic code

00:21:43.570 --> 00:21:46.850
and we can look
up those triplets.

00:21:46.850 --> 00:21:49.340
So there's a dream
that we would be

00:21:49.340 --> 00:21:53.550
able to model other
steps in gene expression

00:21:53.550 --> 00:21:57.780
with the precision with which
the genetic code predicts

00:21:57.780 --> 00:22:00.340
translation-- that we'd
be able to predict where

00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:02.590
the polymerase would start
transcribing, where it will

00:22:02.590 --> 00:22:08.100
finish transcribing, how a
transcript will be spliced,

00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:13.800
et cetera-- all the other
steps in gene expression.

00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:17.470
And that motivates a lot
of work in the field.

00:22:17.470 --> 00:22:19.530
Can protein function be
predicted from sequence?

00:22:19.530 --> 00:22:23.240
So this is a very
classical problem.

00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:26.680
But there are a number of new
and interesting developments

00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:30.900
as resolved from a lot of
this high throughput data

00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:34.060
generation, both in
nucleic acid sequencing

00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:36.830
as well as in proteomics.

00:22:36.830 --> 00:22:39.520
Can evolutionary history be
reconstructed from sequence?

00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:43.292
Again, this has been a
longstanding goal of the field.

00:22:43.292 --> 00:22:45.000
And a lot of progress
has been made here.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:48.400
And now most evolutionary
classifications

00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:52.070
are actually based on molecular
sequence at some level.

00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:56.440
And new species are often
defined based on sequence.

00:22:58.990 --> 00:22:59.800
OK.

00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:01.210
Other motivating questions.

00:23:01.210 --> 00:23:03.717
So what would you
need to measure

00:23:03.717 --> 00:23:05.800
if you wanted to discover
the causes of a disease,

00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:07.866
the mechanisms of
existing drugs,

00:23:07.866 --> 00:23:09.490
metabolic pathways
in a micro-organism?

00:23:09.490 --> 00:23:11.980
So this is a systems
biology question.

00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:13.350
You've got a new bug.

00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:16.030
It causes some disease.

00:23:16.030 --> 00:23:17.030
What should you measure?

00:23:17.030 --> 00:23:18.110
Should you sequences its genome?

00:23:18.110 --> 00:23:19.693
Should you sequence
its transcriptome?

00:23:19.693 --> 00:23:21.540
Should you do proteomics?

00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:23.260
What type of proteomics?

00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:28.330
Should you perturb the system in
some way and do a time series?

00:23:28.330 --> 00:23:31.050
What are the most
efficient ways?

00:23:31.050 --> 00:23:33.530
What information should
be gathered, and in what

00:23:33.530 --> 00:23:34.150
quantities?

00:23:34.150 --> 00:23:37.810
And how should that information
be integrated in order

00:23:37.810 --> 00:23:40.895
to come up with an
understanding of the physiology

00:23:40.895 --> 00:23:42.640
of that organisms
so that, then, you

00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:44.900
can know where to
intervene, what

00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:46.470
would be suitable drug targets?

00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:50.700
Yeah.

00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:51.770
What kind of modeling
would help you

00:23:51.770 --> 00:23:53.540
to use the data to
design new therapies,

00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:56.920
or even, in a synthetic
biology context,

00:23:56.920 --> 00:24:01.435
to re-engineer organisms
for new purposes?

00:24:01.435 --> 00:24:04.890
So microbes to
generate-- to produce

00:24:04.890 --> 00:24:09.820
fuel, for example, or
other useful products.

00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:11.670
What can we currently measure?

00:24:11.670 --> 00:24:15.119
What does each type of
data mean individually?

00:24:15.119 --> 00:24:16.660
What are the strengths
and weaknesses

00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:20.010
of each of the types of
high throughput approaches

00:24:20.010 --> 00:24:21.580
that we have?

00:24:21.580 --> 00:24:26.136
And how do we integrate all
the data we have on a system

00:24:26.136 --> 00:24:28.010
to understand the
functioning of that system?

00:24:28.010 --> 00:24:30.600
So these are some of
the questions that

00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:35.920
motivate the latter topics
on regulatory networks.

00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:36.840
OK.

00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:40.862
So let's now zoom in
and look more closely

00:24:40.862 --> 00:24:41.820
at the course syllabus.

00:24:41.820 --> 00:24:44.440
I've just broken
it into two halves,

00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:48.500
just so it's more readable.

00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:52.010
So today we're going over,
obviously, course mechanics

00:24:52.010 --> 00:24:52.510
mostly.

00:24:57.160 --> 00:25:01.120
On Thursday, we'll cover
both some DNA sequencing

00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:03.970
technologies and we'll talk
about local alignment on BLAST.

00:25:03.970 --> 00:25:05.100
More on that in a bit.

00:25:10.060 --> 00:25:16.790
The 6.8047 recitation--
6.874, thank you-- recitation

00:25:16.790 --> 00:25:19.250
will be on Friday.

00:25:19.250 --> 00:25:21.460
The other recitations
will start next week.

00:25:21.460 --> 00:25:27.022
And then, as you can see, we'll
move through the other topics.

00:25:27.022 --> 00:25:28.480
So each of the
instructors is going

00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:31.520
to briefly review their topic.

00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:34.210
So I won't go through
all the titles here.

00:25:34.210 --> 00:25:37.490
But please note,
on the left side

00:25:37.490 --> 00:25:41.270
here, that their assignment
due dates are marked.

00:25:41.270 --> 00:25:41.950
OK?

00:25:41.950 --> 00:25:45.530
And they're all due at
noon on the indicated day.

00:25:45.530 --> 00:25:48.210
And so some of these
are problem sets.

00:25:48.210 --> 00:25:49.910
So for example,
problem set 1 will

00:25:49.910 --> 00:25:53.410
be due on Thursday,
February 20 at noon.

00:25:53.410 --> 00:25:56.770
And some of the
other assignments

00:25:56.770 --> 00:26:00.200
relate to the project component
of the course, which we're

00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:02.610
going to talk more
about in a moment.

00:26:02.610 --> 00:26:04.970
In particular,
we're going to ask

00:26:04.970 --> 00:26:10.860
you to submit a brief
statement of your background

00:26:10.860 --> 00:26:14.630
and your research interests
related to forming teams.

00:26:14.630 --> 00:26:16.700
So the projects are
going to be done

00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:19.290
in teams of one
to five students.

00:26:19.290 --> 00:26:23.910
And in order to
facilitate especially

00:26:23.910 --> 00:26:26.100
cross disciplinary
teams-- we'd love

00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:28.340
if you interact
with, maybe, students

00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:31.440
in a different grad
program, or whatever--

00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:33.820
you'll post your background.

00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:36.350
You know, I'm a
first year BE student

00:26:36.350 --> 00:26:39.200
and I have a background
in Perl programming,

00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:42.470
but never done Python, or
whatever-- something like that.

00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:47.310
And then, I'm interested
in doing systems biology

00:26:47.310 --> 00:26:50.290
modeling in microbial systems,
or something like that.

00:26:50.290 --> 00:26:52.460
And then you can match
up your interests

00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:54.000
with others and form teams.

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:57.870
And then you'll come up
with your own project ideas

00:26:57.870 --> 00:26:59.710
so that the team
and initial idea

00:26:59.710 --> 00:27:04.090
will be due here, February 25th.

00:27:04.090 --> 00:27:08.010
Then you'll need to do
some aims and so forth.

00:27:08.010 --> 00:27:11.220
So the project components
here, these are only for those

00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:13.870
taking the grad
version of the course.

00:27:13.870 --> 00:27:15.770
We'll make that clear later.

00:27:15.770 --> 00:27:16.310
OK.

00:27:16.310 --> 00:27:20.710
So after the first
three topics here,

00:27:20.710 --> 00:27:26.170
taught by myself and David,
there will be an exam.

00:27:26.170 --> 00:27:27.140
More on that later.

00:27:27.140 --> 00:27:30.990
And then there will be three
more topics, mostly taught

00:27:30.990 --> 00:27:34.110
by Ernest.

00:27:34.110 --> 00:27:38.529
And notice there are additional
assignments here related

00:27:38.529 --> 00:27:40.320
to the project-- so,
to research strategy--

00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:45.490
and the final written report,
additional problems sets.

00:27:45.490 --> 00:27:48.350
We'll have a guest
lecturer here.

00:27:48.350 --> 00:27:50.750
This will be Ron Weiss.

00:27:50.750 --> 00:27:53.840
Then, there will
be the second exam.

00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:56.105
Exams are non-cumulative,
so the second exam

00:27:56.105 --> 00:28:02.370
will just cover these three
topics here predominantly.

00:28:02.370 --> 00:28:06.300
And then there will be
another guest lecturer.

00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:08.290
This would be
George Church here.

00:28:08.290 --> 00:28:10.480
And then notice,
here, presentation.

00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:15.170
So those who are doing
the project component,

00:28:15.170 --> 00:28:19.820
those teams will be given--
assigned a time to present,

00:28:19.820 --> 00:28:23.490
to the class, the results
of their research.

00:28:23.490 --> 00:28:28.600
And you'll be graded--
the presentation will

00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:31.439
be part of the overall
project grade assigned

00:28:31.439 --> 00:28:32.230
by the instructors.

00:28:32.230 --> 00:28:35.640
But you'll also-- we'll
also ask all the students

00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:38.720
in the class to send comments
on the presentations.

00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:41.850
So you may find that you
get helpful suggestions

00:28:41.850 --> 00:28:44.410
about interpreting your data
from other people and so forth.

00:28:44.410 --> 00:28:48.170
So that'll be a
required component

00:28:48.170 --> 00:28:51.800
of the course for all students,
to attend the presentations

00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:53.210
and comment on them.

00:28:53.210 --> 00:28:56.820
And we hope that
will be a lot of fun.

00:28:56.820 --> 00:28:57.320
OK.

00:28:57.320 --> 00:28:59.220
So is this the
right course for me?

00:28:59.220 --> 00:29:02.350
So I just wanted to
let you know you're

00:29:02.350 --> 00:29:05.880
fortunate to have a rich
selection of courses

00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:09.080
in computational systems,
synthetic biology here at MIT.

00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:10.760
I've listed many of them.

00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:14.510
Probably not all,
but the ones that I'm

00:29:14.510 --> 00:29:16.820
aware of that are
available on-campus.

00:29:19.860 --> 00:29:22.750
757 is really only for
biology grad students.

00:29:22.750 --> 00:29:26.030
But the other courses listed
here are generally open.

00:29:26.030 --> 00:29:29.180
Some are more geared for
graduate students, some more

00:29:29.180 --> 00:29:29.990
undergrads.

00:29:29.990 --> 00:29:31.210
Some are more specialized.

00:29:31.210 --> 00:29:35.080
So for example, Jeff Gore's
systems biology course,

00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:37.030
it's more focused
on systems biology

00:29:37.030 --> 00:29:41.307
whereas our course covers both
computational and systems.

00:29:41.307 --> 00:29:43.770
So keep that in mind.

00:29:43.770 --> 00:29:45.270
Make sure you're
in the right place,

00:29:45.270 --> 00:29:48.050
that this is what you want.

00:29:48.050 --> 00:29:48.910
OK.

00:29:48.910 --> 00:29:54.000
A few notes on the textbook--
so there is a textbook.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.400
It's not required.

00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:58.080
It's called Understanding
Bioinformatics

00:29:58.080 --> 00:30:00.000
by Zvelebil and Baum.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.270
It's quite good
on certain topics.

00:30:03.270 --> 00:30:07.590
But it really only covers
about, maybe, a third of what

00:30:07.590 --> 00:30:09.410
we cover in the course.

00:30:09.410 --> 00:30:12.890
So there is good content
on local alignment,

00:30:12.890 --> 00:30:14.690
global alignment,
scoring matrices--

00:30:14.690 --> 00:30:17.070
the topics of the
next couple lectures.

00:30:17.070 --> 00:30:20.220
And I'll point you
to those chapters.

00:30:20.220 --> 00:30:23.130
But it's very
important to emphasize

00:30:23.130 --> 00:30:26.740
that the content of
the course is really

00:30:26.740 --> 00:30:30.410
what happens in lecture,
and on the homeworks,

00:30:30.410 --> 00:30:34.290
and to some extent, what
happens in recitation.

00:30:34.290 --> 00:30:39.270
And the textbook is just there
as a backup, if you will,

00:30:39.270 --> 00:30:41.990
or for those who
would like to get more

00:30:41.990 --> 00:30:46.860
background on the
topic or want to read

00:30:46.860 --> 00:30:50.610
a different description
of that topic.

00:30:50.610 --> 00:30:55.870
So you decide whether you
want to purchase the textbook

00:30:55.870 --> 00:30:56.370
or not.

00:30:56.370 --> 00:30:59.330
It's available at the
Coop or through Amazon.

00:30:59.330 --> 00:31:00.630
Shop around.

00:31:00.630 --> 00:31:01.895
You can find it.

00:31:01.895 --> 00:31:02.520
It's paperback.

00:31:05.030 --> 00:31:08.500
Pretty good general reference
on a variety of topics,

00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:11.881
but it doesn't really have
much on systems biology.

00:31:11.881 --> 00:31:12.380
All right.

00:31:12.380 --> 00:31:15.210
Another important reference
that was developed specifically

00:31:15.210 --> 00:31:19.230
for this course a few years
ago is the probability

00:31:19.230 --> 00:31:20.610
and statistics primer.

00:31:20.610 --> 00:31:24.350
So you'll notice that
some of the homeworks,

00:31:24.350 --> 00:31:27.410
particularly in the earlier
parts of the course,

00:31:27.410 --> 00:31:30.630
will have significant
probability and statistics.

00:31:30.630 --> 00:31:35.800
And we assume that you have
some background in this area.

00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:37.120
Many of you do.

00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:40.840
If you don't, you'll
need to pick that up.

00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:44.710
And this primer was written
to provide those topics,

00:31:44.710 --> 00:31:50.270
in probability especially,
that are foundational

00:31:50.270 --> 00:31:52.910
and most relevant to
computational biology.

00:31:52.910 --> 00:31:57.540
So for example, there
are some concepts

00:31:57.540 --> 00:32:02.600
like p-value, probability
density function, probability

00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:07.010
mass function, cumulative
distribution function,

00:32:07.010 --> 00:32:10.180
and then, common distributions,
exponential distribution,

00:32:10.180 --> 00:32:13.905
Poisson distribution,
extreme value distribution.

00:32:16.940 --> 00:32:20.800
If those are mostly sounding
familiar to you, that's good.

00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:24.600
If they're familiar, but
you couldn't-- you really

00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:27.920
don't-- you get binomial and
Poisson confused or something,

00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:33.100
then, definitely, you want
to consult this primer.

00:32:33.100 --> 00:32:39.860
So I think, looking at the
lectures and the homeworks,

00:32:39.860 --> 00:32:42.550
it should probably
become pretty clear

00:32:42.550 --> 00:32:45.500
which aspects are
going to be relevant.

00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:48.410
And I'll try to point
those out when possible.

00:32:48.410 --> 00:32:51.490
And you can also
consult your TAs

00:32:51.490 --> 00:32:54.631
if you're having trouble with
the probability and statistics

00:32:54.631 --> 00:32:55.130
content.

00:32:55.130 --> 00:32:57.280
So we are going to
focus, here, on, really,

00:32:57.280 --> 00:33:00.340
the computational biology,
bioinformatics content.

00:33:00.340 --> 00:33:04.792
And we might briefly review
a concept from probability,

00:33:04.792 --> 00:33:06.500
like, maybe, conditional
probability when

00:33:06.500 --> 00:33:07.666
we talk about Markov chains.

00:33:07.666 --> 00:33:09.620
But we're not going to
spend a lot of time.

00:33:09.620 --> 00:33:10.560
So if that's the
first time you've

00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:13.200
seen conditional probability,
you might be a little bit lost.

00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:18.760
So you'd be better off
reading about it in advance.

00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:20.270
OK?

00:33:20.270 --> 00:33:22.329
Questions?

00:33:22.329 --> 00:33:22.870
No questions?

00:33:22.870 --> 00:33:23.370
All right.

00:33:23.370 --> 00:33:26.900
Maybe it's that the video
is intimidating people.

00:33:26.900 --> 00:33:28.420
OK.

00:33:28.420 --> 00:33:31.120
All right.

00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:33.920
The TAs know a lot about
probability and statistics

00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:36.260
and will be able to help you.

00:33:36.260 --> 00:33:36.910
OK.

00:33:36.910 --> 00:33:38.820
So homework-- so I
apologize, the font

00:33:38.820 --> 00:33:40.270
is a little bit small here.

00:33:40.270 --> 00:33:42.040
So I'll try to state it clearly.

00:33:42.040 --> 00:33:46.080
So there are going
to be five problem

00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:51.640
sets that are roughly
one per topic.

00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:54.962
Except you'll see p set two
covers topics two and three.

00:33:54.962 --> 00:33:56.420
So it might be a
little bit longer.

00:34:01.450 --> 00:34:08.090
The way we handle students who
have to travel-- so many of you

00:34:08.090 --> 00:34:08.810
might be seniors.

00:34:08.810 --> 00:34:10.768
You might be interviewing
for graduate schools.

00:34:10.768 --> 00:34:13.949
Or you might have other
conflicts with the course.

00:34:13.949 --> 00:34:15.820
So rather than
doing that on a case

00:34:15.820 --> 00:34:20.050
by case basis, which, we've
found, gets very complicated

00:34:20.050 --> 00:34:23.000
and is not necessarily fair,
the way we've set it up

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:25.620
is that the total number of
points available on the five

00:34:25.620 --> 00:34:28.040
homeworks is 120.

00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:28.639
OK?

00:34:28.639 --> 00:34:33.870
But the maximum score
that you can get is 100.

00:34:33.870 --> 00:34:40.929
So if you, for example,
were to get 90% on all five

00:34:40.929 --> 00:34:43.350
of the homeworks,
that would be 90%

00:34:43.350 --> 00:34:46.380
of 120, which would
be 108 points.

00:34:46.380 --> 00:34:48.980
You would get the
full 100-- you'd

00:34:48.980 --> 00:34:50.800
get 100% on your homework.

00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:53.070
That would be a perfect
score on the homework.

00:34:53.070 --> 00:34:53.570
OK?

00:34:53.570 --> 00:34:56.130
But because of that-- because
there's more points available

00:34:56.130 --> 00:35:02.060
than you need-- we don't
allow you to drop homeworks,

00:35:02.060 --> 00:35:04.730
or to do an alternate
assignment, or something

00:35:04.730 --> 00:35:06.690
like that.

00:35:06.690 --> 00:35:08.510
So the way it works
is you can basically

00:35:08.510 --> 00:35:12.441
miss-- as long as
you do well on, say,

00:35:12.441 --> 00:35:14.190
four of the homeworks--
you could actually

00:35:14.190 --> 00:35:16.540
miss one without
much of a penalty.

00:35:16.540 --> 00:35:22.090
For example, if each of the
homeworks were worth 24 points

00:35:22.090 --> 00:35:24.770
and you got a perfect
score on four of them,

00:35:24.770 --> 00:35:26.800
that would be 96 points.

00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:29.300
You would have an almost
perfect score on your homework

00:35:29.300 --> 00:35:31.380
and you could miss
that fifth homework.

00:35:31.380 --> 00:35:32.920
Now of course, we
don't encourage

00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:35.430
you to skip that homework.

00:35:35.430 --> 00:35:38.620
We think the homeworks are
useful and are a good way

00:35:38.620 --> 00:35:42.627
to solidify the information
you've gotten from lecture,

00:35:42.627 --> 00:35:43.710
and reading, and so forth.

00:35:43.710 --> 00:35:45.780
So It's good to do them.

00:35:45.780 --> 00:35:48.850
And doing the homeworks
will help you and perhaps

00:35:48.850 --> 00:35:50.160
prepare you for the exams.

00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:53.555
But that's the way we
handle the homework policy.

00:35:53.555 --> 00:35:55.930
Now I should also mention that
not all the homeworks will

00:35:55.930 --> 00:35:57.820
be the same number of points.

00:35:57.820 --> 00:36:00.770
We'll apportion the
points in proportion

00:36:00.770 --> 00:36:03.836
to the difficulty and length
of the homework assignment.

00:36:03.836 --> 00:36:05.710
So for example, the
first homework assignment

00:36:05.710 --> 00:36:07.790
is a little bit easier
than the others.

00:36:07.790 --> 00:36:11.140
So it's going to have
somewhat fewer points.

00:36:11.140 --> 00:36:13.990
So late assignments--
so all the homeworks

00:36:13.990 --> 00:36:16.410
are due at noon on
the indicated day.

00:36:16.410 --> 00:36:19.670
And if it's within
24 hours after that,

00:36:19.670 --> 00:36:21.850
you'll be eligible
for 50% credit.

00:36:21.850 --> 00:36:27.330
And beyond that, you don't
get any points, in part

00:36:27.330 --> 00:36:30.976
because the TAs will be posting
the answers to the homeworks.

00:36:30.976 --> 00:36:32.260
OK?

00:36:32.260 --> 00:36:36.290
And we want to be able to post
them promptly so that you'll

00:36:36.290 --> 00:36:38.480
get the answers while
those problems are

00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:39.667
fresh in your mind.

00:36:39.667 --> 00:36:40.750
Questions about homeworks?

00:36:44.150 --> 00:36:44.940
OK.

00:36:44.940 --> 00:36:45.560
Good.

00:36:45.560 --> 00:36:46.976
So collaboration
on problem sets--

00:36:46.976 --> 00:36:52.101
so we want you to
do the problem sets.

00:36:52.101 --> 00:36:53.350
You can do them independently.

00:36:53.350 --> 00:36:57.490
You can work with a friend
on them, or even in a group,

00:36:57.490 --> 00:36:58.820
discuss them together.

00:36:58.820 --> 00:37:01.065
But write up your
solutions independently.

00:37:01.065 --> 00:37:03.480
You don't learn
anything by copying

00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:05.190
someone else's solution.

00:37:05.190 --> 00:37:12.890
And if the TAs see duplicate
or near identical solutions,

00:37:12.890 --> 00:37:15.050
both of those
homeworks will get a 0.

00:37:15.050 --> 00:37:15.550
OK?

00:37:15.550 --> 00:37:16.800
And this occasionally happens.

00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:19.910
We don't want this
to happen to you.

00:37:19.910 --> 00:37:21.790
So just avoid that.

00:37:21.790 --> 00:37:26.860
So discuss together, but write
up your solutions separately.

00:37:26.860 --> 00:37:29.340
Similarly, with
programming, if you

00:37:29.340 --> 00:37:31.590
have a friend who's a more
experienced programmer

00:37:31.590 --> 00:37:34.990
than you are, by
all means, ask them

00:37:34.990 --> 00:37:39.270
for advice, general things, how
should I structure my program,

00:37:39.270 --> 00:37:43.070
do you know of a function
that generates a loop,

00:37:43.070 --> 00:37:45.200
or whatever it is that you need.

00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:50.350
But don't share code
with anyone else.

00:37:50.350 --> 00:37:51.434
OK?

00:37:51.434 --> 00:37:52.350
That would be a no-no.

00:37:52.350 --> 00:37:55.240
So write up your
code independently.

00:37:55.240 --> 00:38:00.430
And again, the graders will
be looking for identical code.

00:38:00.430 --> 00:38:02.280
And that will be thrown out.

00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:05.270
And so we don't want
to have any misconduct

00:38:05.270 --> 00:38:07.630
of that type occurring.

00:38:07.630 --> 00:38:08.130
All right.

00:38:08.130 --> 00:38:11.030
So recitations-- there are
three recitation sessions

00:38:11.030 --> 00:38:14.080
offered each week,
Wednesday at 4:00 by Peter,

00:38:14.080 --> 00:38:17.920
Thursday at 4:00 by Colette,
Friday at 4:00 by Tahin.

00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:21.990
And that is a special
recitation that's

00:38:21.990 --> 00:38:25.550
required for the 6.874
students-- David?

00:38:25.550 --> 00:38:29.090
Yes-- and has
additional AI content.

00:38:29.090 --> 00:38:31.320
So anyone is welcome to
go to that recitation.

00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:36.450
But those who are
taking 6.874 must go.

00:38:36.450 --> 00:38:39.180
For students registered for the
other versions of the course,

00:38:39.180 --> 00:38:42.660
going to recitation is optional
but strongly recommended.

00:38:42.660 --> 00:38:46.780
Because the TAs will go over
material from the lectures,

00:38:46.780 --> 00:38:49.040
material that's helpful
for the homeworks

00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:53.090
or for studying for exams--
in the first weeks, Python,

00:38:53.090 --> 00:38:55.020
probability as well.

00:38:55.020 --> 00:38:59.260
So go to the
recitations, particularly

00:38:59.260 --> 00:39:01.890
if you're having
trouble in the course.

00:39:01.890 --> 00:39:04.750
So Tahin's recitation
starts this week.

00:39:04.750 --> 00:39:08.020
And Peter and Colette's
will start next week.

00:39:08.020 --> 00:39:08.550
Question.

00:39:08.550 --> 00:39:08.880
Yes.

00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:11.046
AUDIENCE: Are they covering
the same material, Peter

00:39:11.046 --> 00:39:12.310
and Colette?

00:39:12.310 --> 00:39:14.840
PROFESSOR: Peter and Colette
will cover similar material

00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:16.830
and Tahin will cover
different material.

00:39:24.730 --> 00:39:28.900
Python instruction-- so
the first problem set,

00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:30.900
which will be
posted this evening,

00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:32.860
doesn't have any
programming on it.

00:39:32.860 --> 00:39:35.440
But if you don't
have programming,

00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:38.010
you need to start
learning it very soon.

00:39:38.010 --> 00:39:42.600
And so there will be a
significant programming problem

00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:44.010
on p set two.

00:39:44.010 --> 00:39:46.720
And we'll be posting that
problem soon-- this week,

00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:47.700
some time.

00:39:47.700 --> 00:39:50.800
And you'll want to
look at that and gauge,

00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:53.560
how much Python
do I need to learn

00:39:53.560 --> 00:39:55.690
to at least do that problem.

00:39:55.690 --> 00:39:57.210
So what is this
project component

00:39:57.210 --> 00:39:59.950
that we've been hearing about?

00:39:59.950 --> 00:40:02.580
So here's a more
concrete description.

00:40:02.580 --> 00:40:04.740
So again, this is only
for the graduate versions

00:40:04.740 --> 00:40:05.780
of the course.

00:40:05.780 --> 00:40:09.840
So students will--
basically, we've

00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:12.940
structured it so you
work incrementally

00:40:12.940 --> 00:40:16.240
toward the final
research project

00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:19.720
and so that we can offer
feedback and help along the way

00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:20.700
if needed.

00:40:20.700 --> 00:40:24.650
So the first assignment
will be next week.

00:40:24.650 --> 00:40:27.407
I think it's on Tuesday.

00:40:27.407 --> 00:40:29.490
I'll have more instructions
on Thursday's lecture.

00:40:29.490 --> 00:40:33.130
But all the students
registered for the grad version

00:40:33.130 --> 00:40:34.994
will submit their
background and interests

00:40:34.994 --> 00:40:36.410
for posting on the
course website.

00:40:36.410 --> 00:40:38.250
And then you can
look at those and try

00:40:38.250 --> 00:40:42.020
to find other students who
have, ideally, similar interests

00:40:42.020 --> 00:40:44.620
but perhaps somewhat
different backgrounds.

00:40:44.620 --> 00:40:47.949
It's particularly
helpful to have

00:40:47.949 --> 00:40:49.240
a strong biologist on the team.

00:40:49.240 --> 00:40:53.260
And perhaps, a strong
programmer would help as well.

00:40:53.260 --> 00:40:57.710
So then, you will
choose your teams

00:40:57.710 --> 00:41:02.320
and submit a project title
and one-paragraph summary,

00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:04.660
the basic idea of your project.

00:41:04.660 --> 00:41:08.720
Now we are not providing a
menu of research projects.

00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:11.690
It's your choice--
whatever you want

00:41:11.690 --> 00:41:14.511
to do, as long as it's related
to computational and systems

00:41:14.511 --> 00:41:15.010
biology.

00:41:15.010 --> 00:41:20.060
So it could be analysis of
some publicly available data.

00:41:20.060 --> 00:41:22.600
Could be analysis of
some data that you

00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:24.620
got during your rotation.

00:41:24.620 --> 00:41:27.560
Or for those of you who are
already in labs that you're

00:41:27.560 --> 00:41:29.510
actually working
on, it's totally

00:41:29.510 --> 00:41:32.580
fine and encouraged that the
project be something that's

00:41:32.580 --> 00:41:38.980
related to your main PhD work
if you've started on that.

00:41:38.980 --> 00:41:44.280
And it could also be more in
the modeling, some modeling

00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:47.780
with MATLAB or something, if
you're familiar with that.

00:41:47.780 --> 00:41:49.840
But, a variety of possibilities.

00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:51.980
We'll have more
information on this later.

00:41:51.980 --> 00:41:53.900
But we want you to form teams.

00:41:53.900 --> 00:41:58.920
The teams can work independently
or with up to four friends

00:41:58.920 --> 00:42:00.220
in teams of five.

00:42:00.220 --> 00:42:02.807
And if people want
to have a giant team

00:42:02.807 --> 00:42:04.390
to do some really
challenging project,

00:42:04.390 --> 00:42:07.110
then you can come
and discuss with us.

00:42:07.110 --> 00:42:11.010
And we'll see if
that would work.

00:42:11.010 --> 00:42:14.830
So then there's
the initial title

00:42:14.830 --> 00:42:16.372
and one-paragraph summary.

00:42:16.372 --> 00:42:18.080
We'll give you a little
feedback on that.

00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:21.900
And then you'll submit an
actual specific aims document--

00:42:21.900 --> 00:42:25.060
so with actual,
NIH-style, specific aims--

00:42:25.060 --> 00:42:29.400
the goal is to understand
whether this organism has

00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:36.280
operons or not, or some actual
scientific question-- and a bit

00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:38.180
about how you will
undertake that.

00:42:38.180 --> 00:42:43.730
And then you'll submit a longer
two-page research strategy,

00:42:43.730 --> 00:42:45.540
which will include,
specifically,

00:42:45.540 --> 00:42:47.120
we will use these data.

00:42:47.120 --> 00:42:49.720
We will use this software,
these statistical

00:42:49.720 --> 00:42:52.010
approaches-- that sort of thing.

00:42:52.010 --> 00:42:54.960
And then, toward the end of
the semester, a final written

00:42:54.960 --> 00:42:58.080
report will be due
that'll be five pages.

00:42:58.080 --> 00:42:59.740
You'll work on it
together, but it'll

00:42:59.740 --> 00:43:01.750
need to be clear who did what.

00:43:01.750 --> 00:43:04.130
You'll need an author
contribution statement.

00:43:04.130 --> 00:43:05.480
So and so did this analysis.

00:43:05.480 --> 00:43:08.687
So and so wrote this
section-- that sort of thing.

00:43:08.687 --> 00:43:10.270
And then, as I
mentioned before, there

00:43:10.270 --> 00:43:12.930
will be oral presentations,
by each team,

00:43:12.930 --> 00:43:16.335
on the last two course sessions.

00:43:16.335 --> 00:43:18.610
OK?

00:43:18.610 --> 00:43:20.390
Questions about the projects?

00:43:20.390 --> 00:43:23.787
There's more information on the
course info document online.

00:43:26.821 --> 00:43:27.320
OK?

00:43:27.320 --> 00:43:29.850
Good.

00:43:29.850 --> 00:43:36.560
Yes, so for those taking 6.874,
in addition to the project,

00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:39.700
there will also be
additional AI problems

00:43:39.700 --> 00:43:42.620
on both the p
sets-- and the exam?

00:43:42.620 --> 00:43:43.120
David?

00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:43.350
Yes.

00:43:43.350 --> 00:43:43.849
OK.

00:43:47.090 --> 00:43:49.964
And they're optional for others.

00:43:49.964 --> 00:43:50.840
All right.

00:43:50.840 --> 00:43:51.870
Good.

00:43:51.870 --> 00:43:52.370
OK.

00:43:52.370 --> 00:43:55.470
So how are we going
to do the exam?

00:43:55.470 --> 00:43:58.282
So as I mentioned, there's
two 80-minute exams.

00:43:58.282 --> 00:43:59.240
They're non-cumulative.

00:43:59.240 --> 00:44:00.490
So the first exam
covers, basically,

00:44:00.490 --> 00:44:01.448
the first three topics.

00:44:01.448 --> 00:44:04.369
The second exam is on
the last three topics.

00:44:04.369 --> 00:44:05.160
They're 80 minutes.

00:44:05.160 --> 00:44:08.880
They're during
normal class time.

00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:11.960
There's no final exam.

00:44:11.960 --> 00:44:15.450
The grading-- so for those
taking the undergrad version,

00:44:15.450 --> 00:44:20.390
the homeworks will count 36%
out of the maximum 100 points.

00:44:20.390 --> 00:44:24.000
And the exams will count 62%.

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:25.880
And then, this
peer review, where

00:44:25.880 --> 00:44:27.650
there's two days
where you go, and you

00:44:27.650 --> 00:44:29.340
listen to presentations,
and you submit

00:44:29.340 --> 00:44:32.300
comments online counts 2%.

00:44:32.300 --> 00:44:35.970
For the graduate
Bio BE HST versions,

00:44:35.970 --> 00:44:43.240
it's 30% homeworks, 48% exams,
20% project, 2% peer review.

00:44:43.240 --> 00:44:49.800
For the EECS version, 6.874,
25% homework, 48% exams, 20%

00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:52.870
project, and then, 5% for
these extra AI related

00:44:52.870 --> 00:44:55.830
problems, and 2% peer review.

00:44:55.830 --> 00:44:57.440
And those should add up to 100.

00:44:57.440 --> 00:45:02.020
And then, in addition, we
will reward 1% extra credit

00:45:02.020 --> 00:45:05.320
for outstanding
class participation--

00:45:05.320 --> 00:45:10.405
so questions,
comments during class.

00:45:10.405 --> 00:45:12.385
OK.

00:45:12.385 --> 00:45:13.870
All right.

00:45:13.870 --> 00:45:15.690
So a few announcements
about topic one.

00:45:15.690 --> 00:45:21.180
And then, each of us will review
the topics that are coming up.

00:45:21.180 --> 00:45:22.855
So p set one will
be posted tonight.

00:45:22.855 --> 00:45:25.040
It's due February 20th, at noon.

00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:28.112
It involves basic microbiology,
probability, and statistics.

00:45:28.112 --> 00:45:29.820
It'll give you some
experience with BLAST

00:45:29.820 --> 00:45:31.760
and some of the
statistics associated.

00:45:31.760 --> 00:45:35.390
P set two will be
posted later this week.

00:45:35.390 --> 00:45:38.590
So you don't need to, obviously,
start on p set two yet.

00:45:38.590 --> 00:45:40.210
It's not due for several weeks.

00:45:40.210 --> 00:45:42.670
But definitely, look at
the programming problem

00:45:42.670 --> 00:45:45.020
to give you an idea
of what's involved

00:45:45.020 --> 00:45:49.750
and what to focus on when
you're reviewing your Python.

00:45:49.750 --> 00:45:52.110
Mentioned the
probability/stats primer.

00:45:52.110 --> 00:45:55.110
Sequencing technology--
so for Thursday's lecture,

00:45:55.110 --> 00:45:59.260
it will be very helpful if you
read the review, by Metzger,

00:45:59.260 --> 00:46:01.240
on next gen sequencing
technologies.

00:46:01.240 --> 00:46:02.770
It's pretty well written.

00:46:02.770 --> 00:46:06.190
Covers Illumina,
454, PACBIO, and

00:46:06.190 --> 00:46:11.000
a few other interesting
sequence technologies.

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:12.680
Other background
reading-- so we'll

00:46:12.680 --> 00:46:15.200
be talking about local
alignment, global alignment,

00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:18.430
statistics, and similarly
matrices for the next two

00:46:18.430 --> 00:46:19.310
lectures.

00:46:19.310 --> 00:46:21.340
And chapters four and
five of the textbook

00:46:21.340 --> 00:46:23.760
provide a pretty good
background on these topics.

00:46:23.760 --> 00:46:27.332
I encourage you to take a look.

00:46:27.332 --> 00:46:28.220
OK.

00:46:28.220 --> 00:46:30.390
So I'm just going to
briefly review my lectures.

00:46:30.390 --> 00:46:33.260
And then we'll have David
and Ernest do the same.

00:46:33.260 --> 00:46:35.990
So sequencing
technologies will be

00:46:35.990 --> 00:46:37.300
the beginning of lecture two.

00:46:37.300 --> 00:46:43.170
And then we'll talk about
local ungapped sequence

00:46:43.170 --> 00:46:45.670
alignment-- in
particular, BLAST.

00:46:45.670 --> 00:46:49.140
So BLAST is something
like the Google search

00:46:49.140 --> 00:46:51.150
engine of bioinformatics,
if you will.

00:46:51.150 --> 00:46:53.860
It's one of the most
widely used tools.

00:46:53.860 --> 00:46:56.940
And it's important to understand
something about how it works,

00:46:56.940 --> 00:46:58.440
and in particular,
how to evaluate

00:46:58.440 --> 00:47:01.260
the significance of BLAST
hits, which are described

00:47:01.260 --> 00:47:07.110
by this extreme value
distribution here.

00:47:07.110 --> 00:47:11.900
And then, lecture three, we'll
talk about global alignment

00:47:11.900 --> 00:47:14.750
and introducing gaps
into sequence alignments.

00:47:14.750 --> 00:47:18.680
We'll talk about some
dynamic programming

00:47:18.680 --> 00:47:21.530
algorithms-- Needleman-Wunsch,
Smith-Waterman.

00:47:21.530 --> 00:47:23.930
And in lecture four,
we'll talk about

00:47:23.930 --> 00:47:27.840
comparative genomic analysis
of gene regulation--

00:47:27.840 --> 00:47:33.440
so using sequence similarity
across genomes two infer

00:47:33.440 --> 00:47:36.060
location of regulatory elements
such as microRNA target

00:47:36.060 --> 00:47:39.190
sites, other things like that.

00:47:39.190 --> 00:47:39.690
All right.

00:47:39.690 --> 00:47:44.000
So I think this is now-- oh
sorry, a few more lectures.

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:48.570
Then, in the next unit,
modeling biological function,

00:47:48.570 --> 00:47:51.160
I'll talk about the
problem of motif finding--

00:47:51.160 --> 00:47:56.640
so searching a set of sequences
for a common subsequence,

00:47:56.640 --> 00:48:00.756
or similar subsequences,
that possess

00:48:00.756 --> 00:48:02.130
a particular
biological function,

00:48:02.130 --> 00:48:04.124
like binding to a protein.

00:48:04.124 --> 00:48:05.540
It's often a complex
search space.

00:48:05.540 --> 00:48:06.998
We'll talk about
the Gibbs sampling

00:48:06.998 --> 00:48:08.760
algorithm and some alternatives.

00:48:08.760 --> 00:48:11.410
And then, in lecture
10, I'll talk

00:48:11.410 --> 00:48:13.960
about Markov and hidden
Markov models, which

00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:18.720
have been called the Legos
of bioinformatics, which

00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:23.400
can be used to model a
variety of linear sequence

00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:25.290
labeling problems.

00:48:25.290 --> 00:48:30.200
And then, in the last
lecture of that unit,

00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:32.600
I'll talk a little
bit about protein--

00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:34.610
I'm sorry, about RNA--
secondary structure--

00:48:34.610 --> 00:48:39.970
so the base pairing of
RNAs-- predicting it

00:48:39.970 --> 00:48:44.170
from thermodynamic
tools, as well as

00:48:44.170 --> 00:48:46.620
comparative genomic approaches.

00:48:46.620 --> 00:48:50.190
And you'll learn
about the mfold tool

00:48:50.190 --> 00:48:52.390
and how you can use
a diagram like that

00:48:52.390 --> 00:48:56.350
to infer that this RNA may have
different possible structures

00:48:56.350 --> 00:48:59.360
that I can fold into,
like those shown.

00:48:59.360 --> 00:49:00.060
All right.

00:49:00.060 --> 00:49:02.820
So I'm going to pass
it off to David here.

00:49:11.270 --> 00:49:14.492
PROFESSOR: Thanks
very much, Chris.

00:49:14.492 --> 00:49:15.170
All Right.

00:49:15.170 --> 00:49:16.480
So I'm David Gifford.

00:49:16.480 --> 00:49:18.220
And I'm delighted to be here.

00:49:18.220 --> 00:49:20.560
It's really a
wonderfully exciting time

00:49:20.560 --> 00:49:22.920
in computational biology.

00:49:22.920 --> 00:49:24.620
And one of the reasons
it's so exciting

00:49:24.620 --> 00:49:29.450
is shown on this slide, which
is the production of DNA base

00:49:29.450 --> 00:49:31.620
sequence per
instrument over time.

00:49:31.620 --> 00:49:36.290
And as you can see, it's
just amazingly more efficient

00:49:36.290 --> 00:49:37.620
as time goes forward.

00:49:37.620 --> 00:49:40.570
And if you think about the
reciprocal of this curve,

00:49:40.570 --> 00:49:44.960
the cost per base is basically
becoming extraordinarily low.

00:49:44.960 --> 00:49:47.730
And this kind of
instrument allows

00:49:47.730 --> 00:49:49.910
us to produce
hundreds of millions

00:49:49.910 --> 00:49:53.751
of sequence reads for
a single experiment.

00:49:53.751 --> 00:49:56.000
And thus do we not only need
new computational methods

00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:59.086
to handle this kind
of a big data problem,

00:49:59.086 --> 00:50:00.460
but we need
computational methods

00:50:00.460 --> 00:50:03.730
to represent the results
in computational models.

00:50:03.730 --> 00:50:06.760
And so we have multiple
challenges computationally.

00:50:06.760 --> 00:50:09.710
Because modern biology
really can't be done

00:50:09.710 --> 00:50:12.990
outside of a
computational framework.

00:50:12.990 --> 00:50:16.690
And to summarise the
way people have adapted

00:50:16.690 --> 00:50:18.950
these high throughput DNA
sequencing instruments,

00:50:18.950 --> 00:50:21.010
I built this small
figure for you.

00:50:21.010 --> 00:50:23.325
And you can see that--
Professor Burge will

00:50:23.325 --> 00:50:26.490
be talking about DNA
sequencing next time.

00:50:26.490 --> 00:50:28.310
And obviously, you
can use DNA sequencing

00:50:28.310 --> 00:50:30.800
to sequence your own
genomes, or the genomes

00:50:30.800 --> 00:50:33.850
of your favorite pet,
or whatever you like.

00:50:33.850 --> 00:50:36.060
And so we'll talk about,
in lecture six, how

00:50:36.060 --> 00:50:38.300
to actually do
genome sequencing.

00:50:38.300 --> 00:50:41.590
And one of the challenges
in doing genome sequencing

00:50:41.590 --> 00:50:44.380
is how to actually find
what you have sequenced.

00:50:44.380 --> 00:50:48.700
And we'll be talking about how
to map sequence reads as well.

00:50:48.700 --> 00:50:50.170
Another way to
use DNA sequencing

00:50:50.170 --> 00:50:53.130
is to take the RNA species
present in a single cell,

00:50:53.130 --> 00:50:55.590
or in a population of
cells, and convert them

00:50:55.590 --> 00:50:58.680
into DNA using
reverse transcriptase.

00:50:58.680 --> 00:51:02.140
Then we can sequence the DNA
and understand the RNA component

00:51:02.140 --> 00:51:03.810
of the cell, which,
of course, either

00:51:03.810 --> 00:51:07.260
can be used as messenger
RNA to code for protein,

00:51:07.260 --> 00:51:09.917
or for structural RNAs, or
for non-coding RNAs that

00:51:09.917 --> 00:51:12.250
have other kinds of functions
associated with chromatin.

00:51:14.780 --> 00:51:16.700
In lecture seven,
we'll be talking

00:51:16.700 --> 00:51:19.440
about protein/DNA interactions,
which Professor Burge already

00:51:19.440 --> 00:51:21.620
mentioned-- the idea
that we can actually

00:51:21.620 --> 00:51:24.010
locate all the regulatory
factors associated

00:51:24.010 --> 00:51:27.910
with the genome using a single
high throughput experiment.

00:51:27.910 --> 00:51:30.750
We do this by isolating the
proteins and their associated

00:51:30.750 --> 00:51:33.400
DNA fragments and
sequencing the DNA fragments

00:51:33.400 --> 00:51:37.010
using this DNA
sequencing technology.

00:51:37.010 --> 00:51:40.820
So briefly, the first
thing that we'll

00:51:40.820 --> 00:51:44.160
look at in lecture five is,
given a reference genome

00:51:44.160 --> 00:51:47.250
sequence and a basket
of DNA sequence reads,

00:51:47.250 --> 00:51:49.710
how do we build
an efficient index

00:51:49.710 --> 00:51:51.970
so that we can either
map or align those

00:51:51.970 --> 00:51:54.420
reads back to the
reference genome.

00:51:54.420 --> 00:51:56.840
That's a very important
and fundamental problem.

00:51:56.840 --> 00:51:59.510
Because if I give you a
basket of 200 million reads,

00:51:59.510 --> 00:52:03.280
we need to build its
alignment very, very rapidly,

00:52:03.280 --> 00:52:05.510
and quickly, and
accurately, especially

00:52:05.510 --> 00:52:08.380
in the context of
repetitive elements.

00:52:08.380 --> 00:52:11.300
Because a genome obviously
has many repeats in it.

00:52:11.300 --> 00:52:13.520
We need to consider how
our indexing and searching

00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:16.550
algorithms are going to handle
those sorts of elements.

00:52:16.550 --> 00:52:18.910
In the next lecture,
we'll talk about how

00:52:18.910 --> 00:52:22.075
to actually sequence a
genome and assemble it.

00:52:22.075 --> 00:52:24.450
So the fundamental way that
we approach genome sequencing

00:52:24.450 --> 00:52:26.370
given today's
sequencing instruments

00:52:26.370 --> 00:52:29.450
is that we take intact
chromosomes at the top, which,

00:52:29.450 --> 00:52:31.770
of course, are hundreds
of millions of bases long,

00:52:31.770 --> 00:52:33.980
and we shatter them into pieces.

00:52:33.980 --> 00:52:37.160
And then we sequence
size selected pieces

00:52:37.160 --> 00:52:39.340
in a sequencing instrument.

00:52:39.340 --> 00:52:41.690
And then we need to put the
jigsaw puzzle back together

00:52:41.690 --> 00:52:43.870
with a computational assembler.

00:52:43.870 --> 00:52:46.740
So we'll be talking about
assembly algorithms, how

00:52:46.740 --> 00:52:50.390
they work, and furthermore,
how resolve ambiguities

00:52:50.390 --> 00:52:53.310
as we put that puzzle
together, which often arise

00:52:53.310 --> 00:52:56.280
in the context of
repetitive sequence.

00:52:56.280 --> 00:52:58.480
And in the next lecture,
in lecture seven,

00:52:58.480 --> 00:53:02.140
we'll be looking at how to
actually take those little DNA

00:53:02.140 --> 00:53:04.460
molecules that are
associated with proteins

00:53:04.460 --> 00:53:08.810
and analyze them to figure out
where particular proteins are

00:53:08.810 --> 00:53:11.610
bound to the genome and how they
might regulate target genes.

00:53:11.610 --> 00:53:13.970
Here we see two
different occurrences

00:53:13.970 --> 00:53:16.762
of OCT4 binding events
binding proximally

00:53:16.762 --> 00:53:18.595
to the SOX2 gene, which
they are regulating.

00:53:21.250 --> 00:53:29.730
So that's the beginning of our
analysis of DNA sequencing.

00:53:29.730 --> 00:53:32.940
And then we'll look at RNA
sequencing-- once again,

00:53:32.940 --> 00:53:34.610
with going through
a DNA intermediate--

00:53:34.610 --> 00:53:36.770
and ask the question,
how can we look

00:53:36.770 --> 00:53:39.830
at the expression
of particular genes

00:53:39.830 --> 00:53:43.620
by mapping RNA sequence
reads back onto the genome.

00:53:43.620 --> 00:53:46.910
And there are two fundamental
questions we can address here,

00:53:46.910 --> 00:53:51.860
which is, what is the level
of expression of a given gene,

00:53:51.860 --> 00:53:55.860
and secondarily, what
isoforms are being expressed.

00:53:55.860 --> 00:53:58.210
The second sets of reads,
you see up on the screen,

00:53:58.210 --> 00:54:01.930
are split reads that
cross splice junctions.

00:54:01.930 --> 00:54:05.760
And so by looking at how
reads align to the genome,

00:54:05.760 --> 00:54:09.170
we can figure out which
particular axons are included

00:54:09.170 --> 00:54:13.750
or excluded from a
particular transcript.

00:54:13.750 --> 00:54:17.400
So that's the beginning of
the high throughput biology

00:54:17.400 --> 00:54:19.970
genomic analysis module.

00:54:19.970 --> 00:54:22.870
And I'll be returning to
talk, later in the term,

00:54:22.870 --> 00:54:26.130
about computational genetics,
which, really, is a way

00:54:26.130 --> 00:54:27.790
to summarize everything
we're learning

00:54:27.790 --> 00:54:30.980
in the course into
an applicable way

00:54:30.980 --> 00:54:34.250
to ask fundamental questions
about genome function, which

00:54:34.250 --> 00:54:38.000
Professor Burge
talked about earlier.

00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:43.900
Now we all have about 3
billion bases in our genomes.

00:54:43.900 --> 00:54:46.350
And as you know, you
differ from the individual

00:54:46.350 --> 00:54:49.950
sitting next to you in about
one in every 1,000 base pairs,

00:54:49.950 --> 00:54:51.770
on average.

00:54:51.770 --> 00:54:53.670
And so one question
is, how do we actually

00:54:53.670 --> 00:54:57.880
interpret these differences
between genomes.

00:54:57.880 --> 00:55:00.900
And how can we build
accurate computational models

00:55:00.900 --> 00:55:05.410
that allow us to infer
function from genome sequence?

00:55:05.410 --> 00:55:08.170
And that's a pretty
big challenge.

00:55:08.170 --> 00:55:13.100
So we'll start by
asking questions about,

00:55:13.100 --> 00:55:14.740
what parts of the
genome are active

00:55:14.740 --> 00:55:17.440
and how could we annotate them.

00:55:17.440 --> 00:55:21.030
So we can use, once again,
different kinds of sequencing

00:55:21.030 --> 00:55:24.325
based assays to identify the
regions of the genome that

00:55:24.325 --> 00:55:27.260
are active in any
given cellular state.

00:55:27.260 --> 00:55:29.680
And furthermore, if we
look at different cells,

00:55:29.680 --> 00:55:31.420
we can tell which
parts of the genome

00:55:31.420 --> 00:55:33.250
are differentially active.

00:55:33.250 --> 00:55:35.670
Here you can see
the active chromatin

00:55:35.670 --> 00:55:38.240
during the
differentiation of an ESL

00:55:38.240 --> 00:55:41.500
into a terminal type over
a 50 kilobase window.

00:55:41.500 --> 00:55:44.090
And the regions of the genome
that are shaded in yellow

00:55:44.090 --> 00:55:48.000
represent regions that
are differentially active.

00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:52.090
And so, using this kind of
DNA seq. data and other data,

00:55:52.090 --> 00:55:54.860
we can automatically
annotate the genome

00:55:54.860 --> 00:55:56.840
with where the
regulatory elements are

00:55:56.840 --> 00:56:00.430
and begin to understand what the
regulatory code of the genome

00:56:00.430 --> 00:56:02.560
is.

00:56:02.560 --> 00:56:05.600
So once we understand what
parts of the genome are active,

00:56:05.600 --> 00:56:07.350
we can ask questions
about, how do they

00:56:07.350 --> 00:56:10.720
contribute to some
overall phenotype.

00:56:10.720 --> 00:56:14.240
And our next
lecture, lecture 19,

00:56:14.240 --> 00:56:16.410
we'll be looking
at how we can build

00:56:16.410 --> 00:56:19.530
a model of a
quantitative trait based

00:56:19.530 --> 00:56:22.145
upon multiple loci and the
particular alleles that

00:56:22.145 --> 00:56:23.870
are present at that loci.

00:56:23.870 --> 00:56:27.040
So here you see an
example of a bunch

00:56:27.040 --> 00:56:29.090
of different
quantitative trait loci

00:56:29.090 --> 00:56:31.240
that are contributing to
the growth rate of yeast

00:56:31.240 --> 00:56:33.410
in a given condition.

00:56:33.410 --> 00:56:37.750
So part of our exploration
during this term

00:56:37.750 --> 00:56:40.070
will be to develop
computational methods

00:56:40.070 --> 00:56:43.130
to automatically identify
regions of the genome that

00:56:43.130 --> 00:56:47.760
control such traits and to
assign them significance.

00:56:47.760 --> 00:56:51.010
And finally, we'd like to
put all this together and ask

00:56:51.010 --> 00:56:52.970
a very fundamental
question, which

00:56:52.970 --> 00:56:57.290
is, how do we assign
variations in the human genome

00:56:57.290 --> 00:57:00.500
to differential risk
for human disease.

00:57:00.500 --> 00:57:02.880
And associated questions
are, how could we

00:57:02.880 --> 00:57:06.230
assign those variants to what
best therapy would be applied

00:57:06.230 --> 00:57:08.120
to the disease--
what therapeutics

00:57:08.120 --> 00:57:10.370
might be used, for example.

00:57:10.370 --> 00:57:13.890
And here we have
a bunch of results

00:57:13.890 --> 00:57:15.976
from genome wide
association studies,

00:57:15.976 --> 00:57:17.725
starting at the top
with bipolar disorder.

00:57:17.725 --> 00:57:21.410
And at the bottom
is type 2 diabetes.

00:57:21.410 --> 00:57:23.450
And looking along
the chromosomes,

00:57:23.450 --> 00:57:27.100
we're asking which
locations along the genome

00:57:27.100 --> 00:57:29.300
have variants that
are highly associated

00:57:29.300 --> 00:57:32.640
with these particular diseases
in these so-called Manhattan

00:57:32.640 --> 00:57:33.140
plots.

00:57:33.140 --> 00:57:36.030
Because the things that
stick up look like buildings.

00:57:36.030 --> 00:57:39.920
And so these sorts of studies
are yielding very interesting

00:57:39.920 --> 00:57:45.444
insights into variants that are
associated with human disease.

00:57:45.444 --> 00:57:47.360
And the next step, of
course, is to figure out

00:57:47.360 --> 00:57:51.720
how to actually prove that
these variants are causal,

00:57:51.720 --> 00:57:54.020
and also, to look
at mechanisms where

00:57:54.020 --> 00:57:56.550
we might be able to address
what kinds of therapeutics

00:57:56.550 --> 00:58:00.370
might be applied to deal
with these diseases.

00:58:00.370 --> 00:58:01.930
So those are my two units.

00:58:01.930 --> 00:58:05.090
Once again, high throughput
genomic analysis,

00:58:05.090 --> 00:58:07.870
and secondarily,
computational genetics.

00:58:07.870 --> 00:58:11.026
And finally, if you have
any questions about 6.874,

00:58:11.026 --> 00:58:12.150
I'll be here after lecture.

00:58:12.150 --> 00:58:13.850
Feel free to ask me.

00:58:13.850 --> 00:58:14.350
Ernest.

00:58:24.294 --> 00:58:25.970
PROFESSOR: Thank
you very much, Dave.

00:58:25.970 --> 00:58:26.800
All right.

00:58:26.800 --> 00:58:28.500
So in the preceding
lectures, you'll

00:58:28.500 --> 00:58:30.550
have heard a lot about
the amazing things

00:58:30.550 --> 00:58:32.842
we can learn from
nucleic acid sequencing.

00:58:32.842 --> 00:58:35.300
And what we're going to do in
the latter part of the course

00:58:35.300 --> 00:58:37.034
is look at other
modalities in the cell.

00:58:37.034 --> 00:58:38.450
Obviously, there's
a lot that goes

00:58:38.450 --> 00:58:41.100
on inside of cells
that's not taking place

00:58:41.100 --> 00:58:42.830
at the level of DNA/RNA.

00:58:42.830 --> 00:58:45.520
And so we're going to start
to look at proteins, protein

00:58:45.520 --> 00:58:49.680
interactions, and ultimately,
protein interaction networks.

00:58:49.680 --> 00:58:51.890
So we'll start with
the small scale,

00:58:51.890 --> 00:58:54.180
looking at intermolecular
interactions

00:58:54.180 --> 00:58:56.530
of the biophysics-- the
fundamental biophysics

00:58:56.530 --> 00:58:57.866
of a protein structure.

00:58:57.866 --> 00:59:00.240
Then we'll start to look at
protein-protein interactions.

00:59:00.240 --> 00:59:03.560
And as I said, the final
level will be networks.

00:59:03.560 --> 00:59:05.850
There's been an amazing
advance in our ability

00:59:05.850 --> 00:59:07.830
to predict protein structure.

00:59:07.830 --> 00:59:10.260
So it's always been the dream
of computational biology

00:59:10.260 --> 00:59:12.750
to be able to go from
the sequence of a gene

00:59:12.750 --> 00:59:15.400
to the structure of the
corresponding protein.

00:59:15.400 --> 00:59:17.400
And ever since Anfinsen,
we know that, at least,

00:59:17.400 --> 00:59:20.035
that should be theoretically
possible for a lot of proteins.

00:59:20.035 --> 00:59:22.160
But it's been computationally
virtually intractable

00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:23.351
until quite recently.

00:59:23.351 --> 00:59:24.850
And a number of
different approaches

00:59:24.850 --> 00:59:27.150
have allowed us to
predict protein structure.

00:59:27.150 --> 00:59:28.680
So this slide
shows, for example--

00:59:28.680 --> 00:59:31.120
I don't know which one's
which-- but in blue, perhaps,

00:59:31.120 --> 00:59:33.810
prediction, and in red, the
true structure, or the other way

00:59:33.810 --> 00:59:34.120
around.

00:59:34.120 --> 00:59:35.995
But you can see, it
doesn't matter very much.

00:59:35.995 --> 00:59:39.320
We're getting extremely accurate
predictions of small protein

00:59:39.320 --> 00:59:40.637
structure.

00:59:40.637 --> 00:59:42.220
There are a variety
of approaches here

00:59:42.220 --> 00:59:43.800
that live on a spectrum.

00:59:43.800 --> 00:59:47.270
On the one hand, there's
the computational approach

00:59:47.270 --> 00:59:50.870
that tries to make special
purpose hardware to carry out

00:59:50.870 --> 00:59:52.890
the calculations for
protein structure.

00:59:52.890 --> 00:59:54.380
And that's been
wildly successful.

00:59:54.380 --> 00:59:56.390
On the other end of
the extreme, there's

00:59:56.390 --> 00:59:58.450
been the crowd sourcing
approach to have gamers

00:59:58.450 --> 00:59:59.926
try to predict
protein structure.

00:59:59.926 --> 01:00:01.425
And that turns out
to be successful.

01:00:01.425 --> 01:00:04.244
And there's a lot of interesting
computational approaches

01:00:04.244 --> 01:00:05.160
in the middle as well.

01:00:05.160 --> 01:00:09.080
So we'll explore some of
these different strategies.

01:00:09.080 --> 01:00:11.790
Then, the ability to go from
just seeing a single protein

01:00:11.790 --> 01:00:13.970
structure, how these
proteins interact.

01:00:13.970 --> 01:00:16.150
So now there are
pretty good algorithms

01:00:16.150 --> 01:00:18.220
predicting protein-protein
interactions as well.

01:00:18.220 --> 01:00:20.220
And that allows us, then,
to figure out not only

01:00:20.220 --> 01:00:22.170
how these proteins
function individually,

01:00:22.170 --> 01:00:25.460
but how they begin to
function as a network.

01:00:25.460 --> 01:00:27.250
Now one of the things
that we've already--

01:00:27.250 --> 01:00:29.541
going to be touched on in
the early parts of the course

01:00:29.541 --> 01:00:32.767
are protein-DNA interactions
through sequencing approaches.

01:00:32.767 --> 01:00:34.850
We want to now look at
them at a regulatory level.

01:00:34.850 --> 01:00:38.910
And could you reconstruct
the regulation of a genome

01:00:38.910 --> 01:00:41.010
by predicting the protein-DNA?

01:00:41.010 --> 01:00:42.790
And there's been a
lot of work here.

01:00:42.790 --> 01:00:45.410
We talked earlier
about Eric Davidson's

01:00:45.410 --> 01:00:48.230
pioneering approaches, a lot
of interesting computational

01:00:48.230 --> 01:00:51.790
approaches as well, that go from
the relatively simple models we

01:00:51.790 --> 01:00:54.710
saw on those earlier slides to
these very complicated networks

01:00:54.710 --> 01:00:55.750
that you see here.

01:00:55.750 --> 01:00:57.860
We'll look at what
these networks actually

01:00:57.860 --> 01:01:01.670
tell us, how much information
is really encoded in them.

01:01:01.670 --> 01:01:04.280
They are certainly
pretty, whatever they are.

01:01:04.280 --> 01:01:06.405
We'll look at other kinds
of interactions networks.

01:01:06.405 --> 01:01:09.830
We'll look at genetic
interaction networks as well,

01:01:09.830 --> 01:01:11.350
and perhaps, some other kinds.

01:01:11.350 --> 01:01:13.244
And finally, we'll look
at computable models.

01:01:13.244 --> 01:01:14.410
And what do we mean by that?

01:01:14.410 --> 01:01:16.590
We mean model that
make some kind of very

01:01:16.590 --> 01:01:18.770
specific prediction,
whether it's

01:01:18.770 --> 01:01:21.470
a Boolean prediction-- this gene
will be on or off-- or perhaps,

01:01:21.470 --> 01:01:23.340
an even more
quantitative prediction.

01:01:23.340 --> 01:01:25.140
So we'll look at
logic based modeling,

01:01:25.140 --> 01:01:28.460
and probably, Bayesian
networks as well.

01:01:28.460 --> 01:01:32.190
So that's been a very
whirlwind tour of the course.

01:01:32.190 --> 01:01:33.580
Just to go back
to the mechanics,

01:01:33.580 --> 01:01:35.990
make sure you're signed
up for the right course.

01:01:35.990 --> 01:01:37.970
The undergraduate
versions of the course

01:01:37.970 --> 01:01:40.080
do not have a project.

01:01:40.080 --> 01:01:42.810
And they certainly do not have
the artificial intelligence

01:01:42.810 --> 01:01:43.601
problems.

01:01:43.601 --> 01:01:46.100
Then, there are the graduate
versions that have the project,

01:01:46.100 --> 01:01:48.580
but do not have the AI,
and finally, the 6.874,

01:01:48.580 --> 01:01:49.480
which has both.

01:01:49.480 --> 01:01:52.740
So please be sure you're
in the right class

01:01:52.740 --> 01:01:56.440
so you get credit for
the right assignments.

01:01:56.440 --> 01:01:59.105
And finally, if you've got
any questions about the course

01:01:59.105 --> 01:02:00.480
mechanics, we have
a few minutes.

01:02:00.480 --> 01:02:02.690
We can talk about it here,
in front of everybody.

01:02:02.690 --> 01:02:05.340
And then, we'll all be available
after class, a little bit,

01:02:05.340 --> 01:02:06.780
to answer questions.

01:02:06.780 --> 01:02:09.110
So please, any questions?

01:02:09.110 --> 01:02:09.610
Yes.

01:02:09.610 --> 01:02:11.290
AUDIENCE: Can
undergrads do a project?

01:02:11.290 --> 01:02:12.915
PROFESSOR: Can
undergrads do a project?

01:02:12.915 --> 01:02:15.790
Well, they can sign up for the
graduate version, absolutely.

01:02:15.790 --> 01:02:16.931
Other questions?

01:02:16.931 --> 01:02:17.430
Yes.

01:02:17.430 --> 01:02:22.100
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I actually can't
make either of those sessions.

01:02:22.100 --> 01:02:24.100
PROFESSOR: Well, send an
email to the staff list

01:02:24.100 --> 01:02:26.088
and we'll see what we can do.

01:02:28.932 --> 01:02:29.880
Other questions?

01:02:33.210 --> 01:02:34.133
Yes.

01:02:34.133 --> 01:02:36.971
AUDIENCE: 6.877
doesn't exist anymore--

01:02:36.971 --> 01:02:39.514
Computational Evolutionary
Biology, the class.

01:02:39.514 --> 01:02:41.930
PROFESSOR: Oh, the thing we
listed as alternative classes?

01:02:41.930 --> 01:02:42.430
Sorry.

01:02:42.430 --> 01:02:43.570
PROFESSOR: We'll fix that.

01:02:43.570 --> 01:02:44.278
AUDIENCE: Really?

01:02:44.278 --> 01:02:46.206
I would be so happy.

01:02:46.206 --> 01:02:48.140
[LAUGHTER]

01:02:48.140 --> 01:02:50.260
PROFESSOR: We'll delete
it from our slides, yes.

01:02:54.890 --> 01:02:58.450
We are powerful, but
not that powerful.

01:02:58.450 --> 01:03:01.810
Other questions,
comments, critiques?

01:03:01.810 --> 01:03:02.740
Yes, in the back.

01:03:02.740 --> 01:03:05.210
AUDIENCE: Are each of the
exams equally weighted?

01:03:05.210 --> 01:03:07.293
PROFESSOR: Are each of the
exams equally weighted?

01:03:07.293 --> 01:03:09.745
Yes, they are.

01:03:09.745 --> 01:03:10.245
Yes.

01:03:10.245 --> 01:03:13.944
AUDIENCE: If we're in 6.874,
we have the additional AI

01:03:13.944 --> 01:03:14.908
problems.

01:03:14.908 --> 01:03:17.318
Does that mean that we have
more questions on the exam,

01:03:17.318 --> 01:03:20.922
but just as much
time to do them?

01:03:20.922 --> 01:03:22.880
PROFESSOR: The question
was, if you're in 6.874

01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:25.250
and you have the additional
AI questions on the exam,

01:03:25.250 --> 01:03:27.190
does that mean you
have more questions,

01:03:27.190 --> 01:03:28.420
but the same amount of time.

01:03:28.420 --> 01:03:32.900
And I believe the
answer to that is yes.

01:03:32.900 --> 01:03:34.600
PROFESSOR: We may
revisit that question.

01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:36.975
PROFESSOR: We will revisit
that question at a later date.

01:03:40.530 --> 01:03:43.180
But course six students
are just so much smarter

01:03:43.180 --> 01:03:45.576
than everyone else, right?

01:03:45.576 --> 01:03:46.076
Yes.

01:03:46.076 --> 01:03:47.814
AUDIENCE: Can we switch between
different versions of the class

01:03:47.814 --> 01:03:48.446
by the add deadline?

01:03:48.446 --> 01:03:49.720
PROFESSOR: I'm sorry,
could you say that again?

01:03:49.720 --> 01:03:51.928
AUDIENCE: Can we switch
between versions of the class

01:03:51.928 --> 01:03:52.920
by the add deadline?

01:03:52.920 --> 01:03:55.086
PROFESSOR: Can you switch
between different versions

01:03:55.086 --> 01:03:56.780
of class by the
add/drop deadline?

01:03:56.780 --> 01:03:58.400
In principle, yes.

01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:00.810
But if you haven't
done the work for that,

01:04:00.810 --> 01:04:03.110
then you will be in trouble.

01:04:03.110 --> 01:04:04.910
And there may not be
a smooth mechanism

01:04:04.910 --> 01:04:06.690
for making up missed
work that late.

01:04:06.690 --> 01:04:08.780
Because the add/drop
deadline is rather late.

01:04:08.780 --> 01:04:11.200
So I'd encourage you,
if you're considering

01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:13.300
doing the more intensive
version or not,

01:04:13.300 --> 01:04:15.290
sign up for the more
intensive version.

01:04:15.290 --> 01:04:17.380
You can always drop back.

01:04:17.380 --> 01:04:20.080
Once we form groups
though, for the projects,

01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:21.869
then, obviously,
there's an aspect

01:04:21.869 --> 01:04:23.160
of letting down your teammates.

01:04:23.160 --> 01:04:26.210
So think carefully, now, about
which one you want to join.

01:04:26.210 --> 01:04:28.457
It'll be hard to
switch between them.

01:04:28.457 --> 01:04:30.290
But we'll do whatever
the registrar requires

01:04:30.290 --> 01:04:33.010
us to do in terms
of allowing it.

01:04:33.010 --> 01:04:35.776
Other questions?

01:04:35.776 --> 01:04:36.275
Yes.

01:04:36.275 --> 01:04:40.443
AUDIENCE: If the course sites,
can we undergrads access the AI

01:04:40.443 --> 01:04:42.910
problems just for
fun, to look at them?

01:04:42.910 --> 01:04:43.960
PROFESSOR: Yes.

01:04:43.960 --> 01:04:45.952
If the course sites
remain separate,

01:04:45.952 --> 01:04:48.035
will undergrads be able
to access the AI problems?

01:04:48.035 --> 01:04:49.150
The answer is yes.

01:04:51.781 --> 01:04:52.280
Yes.

01:04:52.280 --> 01:04:54.272
AUDIENCE: Should
students in 6.874

01:04:54.272 --> 01:04:56.270
attend both presentations?

01:04:56.270 --> 01:04:57.755
PROFESSOR: Should
students in 6.874

01:04:57.755 --> 01:04:58.850
attend both presentations?

01:04:58.850 --> 01:04:59.750
Not necessary.

01:04:59.750 --> 01:05:01.270
You're welcome to
both if you want.

01:05:01.270 --> 01:05:04.410
But the course six recitation
should be sufficient.

01:05:07.049 --> 01:05:07.715
Other questions?

01:05:10.600 --> 01:05:11.100
Yes.

01:05:11.100 --> 01:05:14.214
AUDIENCE: So what's covered
in the normal recitations?

01:05:14.214 --> 01:05:16.380
PROFESSOR: What's covered
in the normal recitations?

01:05:16.380 --> 01:05:18.710
It'll be reinforcing material
that's in the lectures.

01:05:18.710 --> 01:05:23.750
So the goal is not introduce any
new material in the course 20,

01:05:23.750 --> 01:05:27.120
course seven recitations.

01:05:27.120 --> 01:05:30.439
Just to clarify, not to
introduce any new material.

01:05:30.439 --> 01:05:31.105
Other questions?

01:05:34.501 --> 01:05:35.000
OK.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:35.350
Great.

01:05:35.350 --> 01:05:36.766
And we'll hang
around a little bit

01:05:36.766 --> 01:05:40.550
to answer any remaining
questions when they come up.

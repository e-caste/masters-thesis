00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
We are back here for some more
stimulating discussion of

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
chemistry.
And I want to begin today by

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
just saying that I find it
particularly ironic that on the

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
day that I am all prepared to
speak to you about the molecular

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
orbital energy levels of
polyatomic molecules for which I

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
am using methane as an
interesting example,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.000
the boards are screwed up.
The reason for that apparently

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
is that this screen came down
and will not go back up.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
And one of the reasons that I
have designed my presentation

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
technique for you this semester
so heavily around the use of the

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
blackboard is that last year,
when I taught the class,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
I had a lot of feedback from
students about how the one day

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.000
when we had audiovisual problems
and I couldn't use my PowerPoint

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
and instead gave an impromptu
chalk talk, that that was their

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
favorite lecture.
Maybe next year we will

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.000
entirely be back to PowerPoint.
I don't know.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
We will see.
But, fortunately,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
I did write out my notes this
morning in electronic format,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
so I can make use of them on
the side boards.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
And, in addition,
I want to display for you some

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
molecular orbital shapes and
properties.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
And I will do that by starting
out --

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Actually, I would like to
start, if I could,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
with this one.
I will go back to the document

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
camera in a moment.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Starting out right where we
left off last time,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000
you will recall that we were
looking at diatomic molecules.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
We started out with a seven
orbital problem two lectures

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
ago.
We looked at the planar BH

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
three molecule.
We had a molecule where the MOs

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
were mixing in two dimensions.
And then last time,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
when we looked at homonuclear
and heteronuclear diatomic

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
molecules the MOs were,
in fact, mixing in just along

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
an axis in one dimension.
And so, when we left the

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
situation last time,
we had arrived at some kind of

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000
an understanding of the energy
levels in the carbon monoxide

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
molecule.
And these were being developed,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
especially, with reference to
CO being a poisonous molecule,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
--
-- whereas, N two,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
another ten valence electron
diatomic molecule was very,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
very inert.
Why was that?

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
It turns out that you have the
very electronegative oxygen atom

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
on one side of the diagram with
its very low energetically lying

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
orbitals mixing with the carbon
orbitals that are higher in

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
energy.
And the neat thing about this,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
for the carbon monoxide
molecule, is that it results in

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
an asymmetry of the molecular
orbitals --

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
-- because the coefficients are
not the same on the carbon side

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
as they are on the oxygen side
as those atomic orbitals blend

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
together into the four sigma and
four pi molecular orbitals that

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
we have.
We have a total of eight MOs,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
and they distribute
energetically as four energy

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
levels in ascending energy that
are sigma in symmetry.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
That is, cylindrically
symmetric about the internuclear

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
axis.
And then we had four that were

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000
pi.
Two energies,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
a pi bonding with four
electrons and a pi antibonding

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000
with just virtual empty
orbitals.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
And because this highest
occupied molecular orbital of

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.000
carbon monoxide is so heavily
concentrated on the carbon end

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
of the molecule,
you can essentially view this

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000
as a carbon-based lone pair.
It has this big lobe here,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000
through which the carbon can
serve as a nucleophile or as a

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.000
base and bind to something that
has an empty orbital.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000
And if that something that has
an empty orbital also has a

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.000
filled orbital that matches the
symmetry of the LUMO of carbon

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.000
monoxide, then you get the
possibility for multiple bonding

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.000
between the carbon of the CO
molecule and that other entity.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000
And we will see that that other
entity may, in fact,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.000
be a d-block transition
element, such as iron.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.000
And what I wanted to do was to
go ahead and show you that the

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
LUMO is an interesting and
unsymmetrical one,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000
as well.
Let's take a look at that.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
And so, in this picture I have
gone ahead and included a little

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
ball and stick diagram
underneath the representation of

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
the orbital lobes.
Here is the carbon,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.000
and the oxygen is colored red.
And you can see that the lobes

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000
on the LUMO, the lowest
unoccupied molecular orbital in

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000
this system, are also large on
carbon relative to oxygen.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000
The same as we had found for
the highest occupied MO.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.000
What this means is that that
carbon atom in the CO molecule

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
is simultaneously a base in the
sigma system.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000
And because this is our lowest
unoccupied molecular orbital,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000
our carbon atom is actually an
acid in the pi system.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
And that makes it
electronically very

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000
complimentary to d-block
elements, as we will see when we

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000
get into the chemistry of
elements that do have valence

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000
d-orbitals in addition to s and
p, coming up in a couple of

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
lectures.
And so what can happen is that,

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000
let's say that a carbon
monoxide molecule somehow

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
erroneously finds its way into
your blood stream,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.000
you have there hemoglobin,
the iron atom at the center of

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.000
which acts reversibly to bind
the dioxygen molecule.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
But it irreversibly binds to
the carbon monoxide molecule

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000
because the iron center,
which is sitting at the center

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.000
of a heme unit that I mentioned,
and we will talk about the

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.000
structure of hemoglobin and the
way that it functions a little

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
bit later.
But if CO gets in there,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000
it binds to the iron through
the HOMO, acting as a base to

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
the metal acting as a sigma
acid, and also through

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000
d-electrons being able to act as
a pi base from the metal binding

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000
with this LUMO of the carbon
monoxide molecule.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
And this LUMO is doubly
degenerate.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
That means there are two of
them at the same energy.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000
And we will come back to this
issue of orbital degeneracy

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
later in today's lecture,
but that electronic asymmetry

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:24.000
of carbon monoxide and the fact
that the HOMO and LUMO are both

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
centered on the carbon end of
the molecule are what make CO

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.000
such an interesting molecule and
such a reactive molecule and

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:36.000
therefore a poison.
And so now let us please go

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
back to the document camera.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
What I have shown here are the
five platonic solids.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000
Actually, I spent a lot of time
over the weekend practicing

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
drawing these on the chalkboard
so that I would be able to do

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000
that very nicely for you.
And here it comes that we do

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.000
not have that option today,
so I will show them to you this

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
way.
And the platonic solids are the

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000
five regular polyhedra.
And that means that they are

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
polyhedra that have,
as their faces,

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
regular polygons that are all
identical.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000
And the reason I am bringing
this up today is that we had

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000
talked about issues of symmetry
with reference to molecular

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
orbital theory.
And these are all very highly

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
symmetric shapes,
as you can immediately

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:34.000
recognize.
The buckyball that we looked at

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000
earlier is not here because it
has both five-membered rings and

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000
six-membered rings on the faces.
And so it doesn't have all the

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000
faces identical.
And those that do have all the

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
faces identical are the platonic
solids.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
And the complete list of those
is shown here.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
With triangles,
you can put four equilateral

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.000
triangles together to make a
tetrahedron.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
There is actually a journal
called Tetrahedron.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
And there is another one called
Tetrahedron Letters.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
And there is another one called
Tetrahedron Reports.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000
And the reason is that organic
chemistry is carbon-based,

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000
and carbon so often gets
involved in forming tetrahedra.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
And so the tetrahedron is a
very important symbol of organic

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
chemistry.
And we will get back to that.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000
And with triangles,
if instead of putting four of

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
them together,
you put eight of them together

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000
this way, you get the
octahedron.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000
And the octahedron is equally
important as a symbol for

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
inorganic chemistry.
And the reason for that is that

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:44.000
when we have metal ions in
solution, they often sit at the

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000
center of a coordination
octahedron in which six ligands

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000
bind to that metal center.
And we are going to get into

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000
how that was discovered pretty
shortly by Alfred Werner,

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000
another Nobel laureate in
chemistry.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.000
And with triangles you can also
make the icosahedron shown here,

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
and this has 20 faces.
And the icosahedron is

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000
important in chemistry.
And certain elements,

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000
for example boron,
actually have structures in the

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000
solid state in which the boron
atoms are arranged at the

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
vertices of a regular
icosahedron.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:28.000
So this is a chemically
important shape as well.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
And if you go from triangles to
squares you can,

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.000
of course, make a cube.
And probably the most familiar

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.000
of a platonic solid to us.
And then, if we go up to

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.000
pentagons and put those
together, as you can see here,

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.000
we can put 12 pentagons
together in a regular way,

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:52.000
that gives rise to what we call
the pentagonal dodecahedron.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:57.000
And you can imagine that each
of these vertices could be a C-H

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:02.000
unit, carbon-hydrogen.
And then each carbon would have

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
its valence of four satisfied.
And there would be all single

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
bonds at the parameter of this
round molecule.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
And, in fact,
that dodecahedron molecule was

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.000
the objective of organic
synthesis for quite a long time

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
before it was finally
successfully synthesized by Leo

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
Paquette.
You would be surprised with the

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
kinds of challenges,
maybe, sometimes that do drive

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000
chemists to do what they do.
And that is the platonic

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000
solids.
I am going to be focusing our

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000
attention on methane.
And, if I could have the side

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
board go back to the computer
for a moment,

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.000
that would be great.
These are the notes for today's

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:48.000
lecture that I wrote up this
morning that you will be able to

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
download later today,
or maybe you already can.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
I don't know.
In any event,

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.000
when we approach the methane
problem in molecular orbital

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:02.000
theory, what we do is recognize
that the tetrahedron can be

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.000
conveniently inscribed into a
cube by placing hydrogens at

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:12.000
alternating corners of the cube,
as shown here.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000
And then, when we do that,
the carbon atom of the methane

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
molecule lies at the very center
of this cube.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:24.000
And this way of arranging the
system in space will help us to

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.000
simplify the problem of the
molecular orbital energy levels

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.000
for the methane molecule.
And we are going to be

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
ultimately working toward a
comparison of the molecular

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.000
orbital description of the
methane molecule with that

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.000
afforded by valance bond theory.
Now, some of you approached me

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
after lecture last time and
said, what happened to

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
hybridization?
And, if you wanted to talk

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000
about the methane molecule and
the language of valence bond

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:57.000
theory, you would say that this
carbon atom is sp three

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
hybridized in order that it may
form simultaneously four two

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000
electron bonds between the
central carbon and the four

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:09.000
peripheral hydrogens.
Well, where hybridization went

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
is that it stayed with valence
bond theory.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
Let me reemphasize the
distinction between the

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:20.000
molecular orbital treatment of
molecule electronic structure as

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.000
contrasted with the valence bond
theory in which hybridization

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
plays a role.
It does not play a role in the

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.000
language of MO theory,
so please keep those quite

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.000
distinct.
Now, we need to choose a

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000
coordinate system for our
problem.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:43.000
And I won't spend too much time
discussing how we choose the

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.000
coordinate system,
but what we have done in the

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.000
present case with methane is to
choose the x,

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:57.000
y, and z axes each to come out
of the faces of the cube.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:02.000
And we do this because that
choice of coordinate system will

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.000
lead to the equivalence of the
carbons' 2px,

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
2py, and 2pz orbitals in 3D
space.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.000
We could choose a different
coordinate system,

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.000
and that would make the problem
more difficult.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:22.000
So, what we have done is chosen
a convenient set of coordinates

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:27.000
where the x, y,
and z axes each come out of the

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:31.000
faces of our cube.
Now, we recognize that the

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000
methane problem,
like the homonuclear and

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.000
heteronuclear diatomic molecule
problems we talked about last

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
time, is an eight orbital
problem.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.000
The diatomics N two and
CO each had ten electrons to go

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000
into their eight molecular
orbitals.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000
And here, with methane,
we have eight electrons,

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:54.000
four coming in as the valence
orbitals from the carbon atom,

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000
valence electrons from the
carbon atom, rather,

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:01.000
and four coming in as the four
valence 1s electrons for the

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:06.000
four hydrogens.
And our eight orbitals are the

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
carbons 2s, 2px,
2py, and 2pz orbitals.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.000
And we have four more orbitals,
the 1s from each of the four

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000
hydrogens.
We know how many electrons are

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
going to be able to go into our
MO energy level diagram.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.000
We know how many MOs we are
going to have because we know

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:26.000
how many valance AOs we have.
And those numbers are equal at

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.000
eight.
The choice of this problem is

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:35.000
predicated on my desire to show
you how things progress as we go

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:40.000
from a planar system to a linear
system to now a system that has

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:45.000
molecular orbitals that stretch
out in three-dimensional space.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:49.000
Now, we are going to take the
following approach.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000
We are going to say,
how can we generate linear

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.000
combinations of the four
hydrogen 1s orbitals that will

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:01.000
be so constructed as to match
the nodal properties of the

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:06.000
carbon atomic orbitals that are
the valence orbitals of that

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
carbon?
Okay.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.000
So that is our goal,
and that is our strategy.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:17.000
And let me say also,
that in this tetrahedral

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:23.000
symmetry, you can recognize that
you cannot distinguish any one

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:28.000
of the four vertices of a
tetrahedron from the other

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000
three.
And that is important.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:36.000
And that is also true from the
way that we have decided to

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.000
situate the hydrogen nuclei on
this cube relative to our

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000
coordinate system.
In other words,

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:47.000
none of these four hydrogens
lie on any of the three

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:51.000
Cartesian axes.
And their relationship to the

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:55.000
coordinate system and to the
shape of the cube each is

00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:01.000
indistinguishable from that of
the other three hydrogens.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000
And that is an important aspect
of the way that we set up the

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000
problem.
And why do I mention that?

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.000
Because I mentioned that when
constructing MOs in general,

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:15.000
one of the first things you can
do, if you are going to be able

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:19.000
to take advantage of symmetry to
help you solve the problem of

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:23.000
these MO energy levels and how
they are constructed from linear

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:27.000
combinations of atomic orbitals
is to identify symmetry-related

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:32.000
sets of atoms in orbitals.
If you are keeping that in

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:37.000
mind, you will realize that we
are treating all four hydrogens

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:41.000
together because they are
indistinguishable from one

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:46.000
another in the tetrahedral shape
of the methane molecule.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:50.000
So, that is important.
If we had a more complicated

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:55.000
molecule, such as if we were
looking at --

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.000
I get to use a little bit of
board space today.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:02.000
Here is a slightly more
complicated hydrocarbon

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000
molecule.
Here is a slightly more

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.000
complicated hydrocarbon
molecule.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:11.000
And in a molecule like this,
this is cyclohexane drawn in a

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:15.000
chair confirmation.
Sir Derek Barton actually was

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:19.000
the Nobel laureate who got his
prize for discussing

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.000
conformational aspects of
hydrocarbons.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.000
We would find that the
hydrogens split up into two

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:30.000
sets.
They are not all equivalent in

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.000
the cyclohexane molecule in this
frozen out chair confirmation

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.000
because we have one type that is
equatorial and one type that is

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.000
axial on each of these carbons
as we go around this

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.000
six-membered ring.
And so there are different sets

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.000
that you would have to treat
separately.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000
But methane is more
symmetrical.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.000
And all four hydrogens in the
methane molecule are identical,

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.000
so we are going to treat them
together in developing our

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:02.000
linear combinations.
And, coming back to this,

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:06.000
what we are going to do,
once again, to generate these

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:10.000
things, is to imagine the
central atom atomic orbital as

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.000
growing out in space out to
where the hydrogen nuclei are.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.000
And then we are going to take
the sign of the wave function

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:21.000
that we find out there and apply
it to those hydrogens that are

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:26.000
out there in space in order to
see what our linear combination

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.000
must look like.
If you imagine the carbon 2s

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.000
orbital, which has the same
sign, positive,

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.000
everywhere, and imagine it
growing out to where the

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.000
hydrogens are,
and we are labeling the

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.000
hydrogen A, B,
C, and D, as shown here.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:44.000
And we will keep that same
labeling scheme throughout the

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.000
development of this problem.
You would see that the carbon

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:51.000
2s positive wave function,
as we imagine it growing out to

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:54.000
where the hydrogens are,
would touch each of these

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:58.000
hydrogens at the same time.
And, thus, we confer the sign

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:02.000
positive on all four of the
contributors to this first of

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:07.000
our linear combinations.
And what that will represent is

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:12.000
simultaneous bonding of the
carbon 2s orbital with all four

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.000
hydrogens and with the same sign
everywhere.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:19.000
And so, we can write down
one-half A plus B plus C plus D,

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:23.000
where I am using A here to

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:28.000
represent the hydrogen 1s
orbital associated with hydrogen

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:32.000
labeled A.
So I have just abbreviated that

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:33.000
in A.
And, similarly,

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:37.000
B is the hydrogen 1s orbital
associated with hydrogen B and

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.000
so on.
So, this is a linear

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:42.000
combination of these four
hydrogen orbitals.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.000
And it is normalized with a
half, here.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:48.000
And we have the same
coefficient on each of the four

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:52.000
hydrogens, so the size of the
lobe that you would draw at each

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:55.000
four of these positions would be
the same.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:59.000
That is number one.
We have built a linear

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:03.000
combination based on the nodal
properties of the carbon 2s

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.000
atomic orbital.
And now, let's do two more.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:11.000
And we are going to base these
on the nodal properties of the

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:15.000
central carbon 2px orbital and
the central carbon 2py orbital.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:19.000
I am using the same coordinate
system as I started with,

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:24.000
namely, that the positive
x-axis comes out of the face of

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:28.000
the cube and comes toward us,
and the positive y-axis comes

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:33.000
out of this face of the cube and
goes that way.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.000
And we will look at z in a
moment.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:40.000
That one is going straight up
out of the top face of the cube

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:44.000
for positive z.
What you can see is that if you

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:48.000
imagine the carbon 2px atomic
orbital as just growing out to

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:53.000
where the four hydrogens are,
we will see that the hydrogens

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:57.000
in positions A and B will
experience the positive lobe of

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:02.000
the carbon 2px orbital at the
same moment as the two hydrogens

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:06.000
in back labeled C and D
experience the negative lobe of

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:12.000
the carbon 2px orbital.
And so, we give positive phase

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:16.000
to A and B and negative phase to
C and D.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.000
And we give them the same
coefficient everywhere such that

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:25.000
this linear combination is
normalized as one-half A plus B

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:30.000
minus C minus D.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:33.000
That is our second linear
combination of hydrogen

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.000
orbitals.
And this one has been so

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:40.000
generated as to match the nodal
property of the carbon 2px

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:44.000
orbital, the key feature of
which is that it is everywhere

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:48.000
positive along positive x,
and everywhere along negative x

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:51.000
it is negative.
And the 2py orbital of carbon

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:56.000
has the property that everywhere
in the plus y region of space,

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:59.000
it is positive,
so that C and B will be

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:05.000
associated with a positive sign
for this linear combination.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:09.000
And the 2py orbital is negative
everywhere along negative y,

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:12.000
back here.
And that is where hydrogens A

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:15.000
and D are located.
So, A and D will carry a

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:18.000
negative sign for this new
linear combination,

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.000
which is one-half of minus A
plus B plus C minus D.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:26.000
This is just one way
of writing down

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:32.000
the picture that we see here.
And there is only one left to

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:37.000
be generated from the nodal
properties of the carbon 2pz

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:42.000
orbital, which has its positive
node oriented along positive z

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:46.000
and its negative lobe oriented
along negative z,

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:50.000
and it has the x,y-plane as a
nodal surface.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:54.000
And so, therefore,
hydrogens A and C will carry a

00:23:54.000 --> 00:24:00.000
positive sign because they are
oriented and located in the plus

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:05.000
z region of space.
Whereas, hydrogens B and D are

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:09.000
located in the negative z region
of space, so they will carry a

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:13.000
negative sign.
And that one can be normalized

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:16.000
also with a normalization
coefficient of one-half.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:19.000
And so it is A minus B plus C
minus D.

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:23.000
And just don't forget
that these letters

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:27.000
refer to the 1s orbitals
associated with the hydrogens

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:32.000
that are so labeled.
And we started with identifying

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:37.000
the fact that the four hydrogens
in this problem are all

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:40.000
equivalent.
And, thus, their 1s orbitals

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:44.000
are all equivalent,
indistinguishable from each

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:47.000
other with respect to their
spatial orientation.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:51.000
And, so we took four atomic
orbitals, and we are

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:56.000
constructing from them four
linear combinations of those

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:01.000
four atomic orbitals.
I want to emphasize what I have

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:04.000
written here,
which is that with the

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:08.000
coordinate system we have chosen
and in this high tetrahedral

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:13.000
symmetry, the carbons 2p x,
y and z orbitals are identical.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:17.000
And, just like in a carbon atom
floating free in space,

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:21.000
they are degenerate.
That means they have the same

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:24.000
energy.
And so we will talk about

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:29.000
orbitals in atoms being
degenerate in a moment.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:33.000
But we find that the 2p x,
y and z orbitals on that carbon

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:37.000
are going to have the same
energy, and they are degenerate.

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:41.000
And the molecular orbitals
constructed from them in this

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:44.000
tetrahedral system will have the
same property.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:47.000
They will be degenerate.
So, something that is

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:51.000
occasionally associated with
high symmetry is multiple MO

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:55.000
degeneracy.
Next, knowing what our carbon

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:59.000
atom atomic orbitals are and
knowing also what our four

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:03.000
linear combinations are of the
hydrogen 1s orbitals,

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:07.000
we can now allow them to
interact in ways that are either

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:11.000
bonding or antibonding.
And they interact,

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:14.000
of course, according to their
nodal properties.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:19.000
Those linear combinations that
have the same nodal properties

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:23.000
as a particular carbon atom
atomic orbital will lead to a

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:29.000
bonding interaction and an
antibonding interaction.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:33.000
And we have an eight orbital
problem, so we better see eight

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:37.000
energy levels appearing in our
molecular orbital energy level

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:39.000
diagram for this methane
molecule.

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:43.000
And, when we go down here,
starting at the lowest energy

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:46.000
molecular orbital,
we find that it can be

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:49.000
constructed by adding to the
carbon 2s orbital,

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:53.000
which is, once again,
spherically symmetric,

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:57.000
this linear combination that is
A plus B plus C plus D.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:00.000
And we can draw this with a

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:03.000
surface like this,
which envelopes all five of our

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:08.000
nuclei which has the same sign
everywhere.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.000
And so our lowest lying
molecular orbital,

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:14.000
our most bonding molecular
orbital, our most stabilized MO,

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:17.000
which can house a pair of
electrons because it is singly

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:21.000
degenerate, is one that will
look something like this.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.000
It envelopes all five of our
nuclei.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:26.000
And, effectively,
the pair of electrons is

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:30.000
associated simultaneously with
all five nuclei.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:33.000
And the wave function has the
same sign everywhere,

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:38.000
just like the carbon 2s orbital
from which this is partially

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:41.000
constructed does.
And then, next we have three

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:45.000
molecular orbitals that are each
built by forming bonding

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:48.000
interactions with the carbon's
p-orbitals, px,

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:53.000
py, and pz with the linear
combination that matches that

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:56.000
carbon orbital in terms of the
nodal properties.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:00.000
And we built them that way so
that becomes particularly

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:04.000
straightforward.
This one here is coming out,

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:07.000
the face that points to the
right.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:11.000
And so you can see that this
one is based on the carbon 2py

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.000
orbital.
And, if that carbon 2py orbital

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:18.000
makes a bonding interaction with
the linear combination denoted

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:21.000
as minus A plus B plus
C minus D,

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:25.000
the bonding interaction here is
signified by this plus sign.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:30.000
So, we have a plus sign here
and a plus sign here.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:34.000
And, thus, we have a molecular
orbital that has the same nodal

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:37.000
properties as a carbon 2py
orbital does,

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:41.000
which means that the x,z-plane
is a nodal surface for this

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:45.000
molecular orbital.
And what it looks like is kind

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:49.000
of a two-bladed propeller.
You have a plus phase that is

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:54.000
distributed, enveloping the two
hydrogens that we labeled B and

00:28:54.000 --> 00:29:00.000
C, along with that positive lobe
of the carbon 2py orbital.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:04.000
So that you have that forming
one blade of our two-bladed

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:08.000
propeller.
And the blade with the other

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:12.000
sign is rotated relative to the
first by 45 degrees.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:16.000
Sorry, by 90 degrees,
in fact, and will involve the

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:21.000
distribution of bonding
character over carbon's negative

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:26.000
2py lobe interacting with these
two hydrogens back here,

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:32.000
which are hydrogens A and D.
And so we will visualize these

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.000
in a moment to make that more
clear.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:37.000
But these three bonds,
one oriented along x,

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:41.000
one oriented along y,
and one oriented along z all

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:44.000
look exactly like this.
They are just rotated 90

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:47.000
degrees to each other in space,
just like the x,

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:51.000
y, and z Cartesian axes are.
I have only drawn one of them,

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:55.000
but we have three of them
because there is a three-fold

00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:00.000
orbital degeneracy in this
molecular orbital.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.000
So, singly degenerate and then
triply degenerate.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:07.000
And then, as we go up in
energy, we will find that our

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:10.000
lowest unoccupied molecular
orbital is constructed by

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:13.000
subtracting.
It is the same as I have

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.000
written here,
but with a minus sign,

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:19.000
the C 2s subtracting A plus B
plus C plus D.

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.000
A, B, C and D hydrogens all

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:25.000
have the same sign to their wave
function as each other,

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:29.000
but they have the opposite sign
as the contribution from the

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:34.000
carbon 2s orbital to this
molecular orbital.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:37.000
And what that results in,
as I have tried to indicate

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:41.000
with some red dashes here,
is that you generate a nodal

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:46.000
surface in between the carbon
and hydrogen nuclei that will go

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:50.000
completely around and will
intersect perpendicular to each

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:54.000
of these carbon-hydrogen
inter-nuclear vectors.

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:58.000
You have a change of sign as
you are traversing the path from

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:03.000
carbon to any one of the four
hydrogen nuclei.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:06.000
And that is what we get by just
reversing the sign relative to

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:09.000
the bonding counterpart of that
orbital.

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:11.000
And that makes this one
anti-bonding.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:15.000
We will give it an asterisk
here to denote antibonding

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:17.000
character to this molecular
orbital.

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:21.000
And now, ascending in energy,
we will find that for each one

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:25.000
of these orbitals that is bonded
and oriented with respect to x,

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:28.000
y or z in Cartesian space,
we find that there is an

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:32.000
antibonding counterpart.
Again, what we are doing is

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:36.000
taking, for example,
carbons 2py and subtracting the

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:40.000
linear combination that
corresponds to carbon 2py in

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.000
terms of its nodal symmetry
properties.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:47.000
We are subtracting minus A plus
B plus C minus D.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:49.000
The carbon 2py has the same

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:53.000
plus, its positive lobe is
oriented along positive y,

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:57.000
just as it is down here,
but now we have reversed the

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:02.000
sign of the four hydrogens.
And what this introduces will

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:07.000
be antibonding nodal surfaces in
between the carbon and the

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:11.000
hydrogens.
And they are strong antibonding

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:16.000
interactions because of the good
directional overlap of,

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:20.000
say, the positive lobe of
carbon's 2py with these

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:26.000
s-orbital contributions in the
negative from hydrogens C and B,

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.000
here.
And back here,

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:33.000
A and D rotated,
of course, by 90 degrees.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:37.000
One of the points that I was
illustrating last time and

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:41.000
really trying to emphasize in
the context of MO theory is

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:45.000
that, in general,
we expect orbitals to be higher

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:48.000
in energy if they have more
internuclear nodes.

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:53.000
And the energy of the orbitals
is also affected by which atomic

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:58.000
orbitals are close to the MO in
energy and also by factors of

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:01.000
overlap.
And normally,

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:04.000
for example,
a sigma bond is typically

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:09.000
associated with greater overlap
than a pi bond because of the

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:13.000
directionality of the overlap.
And here, you have an

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:17.000
interesting case,
where this p-orbital is not

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:23.000
directed right at the hydrogen.
And it is not a pi bond either.

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:27.000
It is something in between sort
of sigma and a pi type of

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:32.000
orientation.
It is an oblique interaction of

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:36.000
the hydrogen 1s wavefunction
with that lobe of the p-orbital.

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:40.000
But, still, it gives rise to
very good overlap down here,

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:44.000
and consequently a very strong
antibonding character up here in

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:47.000
counterpart.
And, from calculation,

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:51.000
this is the order of the energy
levels that come out of that.

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:55.000
And so we have only four energy
levels, two of which are triply

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:59.000
degenerate, so we indeed have
eight wave functions that

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:04.000
correspond to the molecular
orbitals of this system.

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:25.000
Question down here?
Could you say that louder?

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:26.000
Why did this not have the
one-half?

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:29.000
The one-half is missing there
because I forgot to put it

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:32.000
there.
Yes, to be normalized it should

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:35.000
have a one-half there.
That is right.

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:39.000
But then there is a further
point that that brings up,

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:43.000
which is the following.
What I am implying here is that

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:48.000
there are equal amounts of
carbon 2s in the bonding orbital

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:51.000
and as in the antibonding
counterpart.

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:55.000
But that need not be the case.
It could be that this is 0.6

00:34:55.000 --> 00:35:01.000
here and that this 0.4 up here.
And that is a greater level of

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:06.000
detail than I am really
interested in going into for the

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:09.000
purposes of this problem.
But your point,

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:13.000
with respect to the
coefficient, is well taken.

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:16.000
Thanks.
Christine, maybe we can fix

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:20.000
that on the one that gets posted
on the web.

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:26.000
Let's now look at these things
using our VMD program.

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:41.000
Starting from the lowest energy
and we will work our way up.

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:52.000
Which orbital is this?
This is a molecular orbital of

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:54.000
the methane molecule.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:04.000
One way you can identify
orbitals is where they are with

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.000
reference to the HOMO or the
LUMO.

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:09.000
In this case,
the HOMO is triply degenerate.

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:13.000
And there is one orbital lower
in energy than the HOMO.

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:17.000
This would be then the HOMO
minus one because it is one

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:21.000
below the HOMO in energy.
That is the one which is the

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:24.000
carbon 2s, plus A plus B plus C
plus D.

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:27.000
That is that MO there.

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:39.000
Actually, let's go ahead and
take that one away.

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:50.000
Sorry about that.

00:36:55.000 --> 00:37:00.000
Let's see if you can figure out
which one this is.

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:18.000
In order to figure out which
one it is, you need to be able

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:23.000
to realize where the nuclei are
and where your internuclear

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:26.000
nodes are, if any.
And, if so, how many.

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:30.000
This is one of our hydrogen
contributions.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:33.000
Here is a hydrogen contribution
with opposite sign.

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:38.000
And there is a piece of our
carbon 2p orbital in the center.

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:43.000
Now, this is just one of three
identical counterparts that are

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:47.000
rotated 90 degrees with respect
to each other in space,

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:51.000
so I am not going to show you
all three of them.

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:55.000
They all look exactly the same.
Is this one bonding or

00:37:55.000 --> 00:38:00.000
antibonding?
Yeah, this one is antibonding.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:03.000
And it does not have the same
sign on all the hydrogens,

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:07.000
so it has to be part of our
LUMO, which is triply degenerate

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.000
and involves bonding or,
in this case,

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:13.000
the antibonding between a
carbon 2p orbital with a linear

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:17.000
combination of four hydrogens.
You can see that when you have

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:20.000
an antibonding orbital,
you are depleting the electron

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:25.000
density in the space between the
nuclei rather than increasing it

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:30.000
as you do in a bonding orbital.
Let's go ahead and look at the

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:34.000
bonding counterpart of this one.
And we will do that.

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:38.000
And let's delete it.
One thing that you will get,

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:43.000
if you haven't already gotten
it, is you are going to get a

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:48.000
link to be able to download all
the files that I used to show

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:51.000
you molecular orbitals with in
class.

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:55.000
Because this program I am
using, this VMD program,

00:38:55.000 --> 00:39:01.000
is available on Athena.
And you can also download it

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:06.000
yourself for free onto your own
computer if you want to.

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:10.000
And so this is going to give
you the opportunity to study

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:16.000
these orbitals and rotate them
around at your leisure on your

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:19.000
desktop.
And now, let's look at the

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:24.000
bonding counterpart to that
antibonding orbital that we just

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:27.000
looked at.
This one is the two-bladed

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:33.000
propeller to which I referred.
And you can see that this

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:37.000
orbital has the same symmetry
with respect to its nodal

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:41.000
properties as a carbon 2p
orbital because it has a single

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:45.000
nodal plane.
And one side all the signs are

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:49.000
positive, and on the other side
all the signs are reversed.

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:54.000
And we have a nice piece of
bonding going on there and there

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:59.000
when we have this oblique
interaction of one of the lobes

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:04.000
of a p-orbital simultaneously
with two of the hydrogens that

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:08.000
it sits directly between in
space.

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:13.000
There is one of our triply
degenerate components of our

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:17.000
highest occupied molecular
orbital.

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:23.000
And then, there is just one
left to visualize.

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:40.000
All right.
We will delete that one.

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:53.000
We looked at our most symmetric
and most bonding molecular

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:55.000
orbital.
And now, we are going to go

00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:59.000
ahead and look at the
antibonding counterpart of that

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:00.000
one.

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:17.000
And so this is clearly a
molecular orbital that is formed

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:20.000
using some piece of the carbon
2s orbital.

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:24.000
And you see that you get a
change in sign as you go from

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:28.000
carbon to each of the hydrogens,
that accordingly the electron

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:32.000
density is depleted in the
region of space between the

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:36.000
nuclei.
And that is a characteristic of

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:39.000
an antibonding orbital.
And this one,

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:42.000
according to our diagram,
in fact, is the LUMO.

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:47.000
So, as you will see over here,
that was what we predicted our

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:51.000
lowest unoccupied molecular
orbital would look like.

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:54.000
And then, up here,
we had our triply degenerate

00:41:54.000 --> 00:42:00.000
LUMO plus one based on the
carbon 2p orbital interactions.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:04.000
Now, you can see what these
four types of molecular orbital

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:06.000
would look like.
And now, you wonder,

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:10.000
just what kind of prediction
does this make regarding

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:13.000
experimental observables.
And so let's look at this

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:15.000
picture.

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:30.000
This diagram contains a number
of interesting features.

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:34.000
It is a diagram that plots
ionization energy here on the

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:39.000
x-axis against a number of
different molecules on the

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:42.000
y-axis.
At the top you have simply a

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:46.000
neon atom.
Neon is our noble gas atom that

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:50.000
lies just immediately to the
right of fluorine in the

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:53.000
periodic table.
If anything is more

00:42:53.000 --> 00:43:00.000
electronegative than fluorine,
it would actually be neon.

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:04.000
This inert gas that is
extremely difficult to ionize

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:09.000
because it holds so tightly onto
all eight of its electrons.

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:14.000
Does it hold equally tightly
onto all eight of its electrons?

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:19.000
The answer is no because,
as you scroll across here in

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:23.000
ionization energy,
you see that its 2p electrons

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:29.000
ionize here, and its 2s
electrons ionize way over here.

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:31.000
The type of diagram I showed
you last time,

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:35.000
where the 2s orbital,
as you go across the periodic

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:38.000
table, decreases in energy
faster than does the set of 2p

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:42.000
orbitals associated with an
atom, is expressed in this

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:44.000
diagram here because we have
neon.

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:47.000
And then we are going across
the periodic table.

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:51.000
This next molecule is HF,
an eight electron species,

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:54.000
and H two O,
an eight electron species,

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:57.000
and then NH three,
ammonia, the other eight

00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:02.000
electron species.
And then over here we get to CH

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:05.000
four, the molecule
that we have just

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:08.000
discussed today.
And what is very interesting

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:12.000
here is that the ionization
energies of the molecular

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:16.000
orbitals, in the case of the
molecules, and of the atom in

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:18.000
the case of neon track very
nicely.

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:22.000
Here is the molecular orbital
that has 2s character of HF,

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:25.000
of H two O,
of NH three,

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:29.000
and of CH four.
And it is rising in energy as

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:34.000
we go from right to left across
the periodic table.

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:38.000
And that is because the carbon
2s orbital is much higher than

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:41.000
the neon 2s orbital is,
for example.

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:46.000
And the carbon 2s orbital is
contributing to that most

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:50.000
bonding of molecular orbitals of
the methane molecule.

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:55.000
And then there is this manifold
here, that corresponds to

00:44:55.000 --> 00:45:00.000
ionizing an electron out of the
HOMO of methane.

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:04.000
And it is a broadened peak
distribution here because of the

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:08.000
different vibrational states
that the methane can be found in

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:11.000
when, in fact,
it experiences an incoming high

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:15.000
energy photon that is capable of
knocking the electron out of the

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:17.000
methane molecule and ionizing
it.

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:20.000
This is called photoelectron
spectroscopy.

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:24.000
And you will be reading about
it also in the context of your

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:30.000
problem set because we have a
problem that deals with this.

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:33.000
And I point you to a piece of
your text that covers

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:37.000
photoelectron spectroscopy.
But the key point here is that

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:40.000
if you had all your eight
electrons at one energy,

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:44.000
as valance bond theory might
suggest for a molecule like

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:49.000
this, you might think you should
only see one peak in the PES of

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:51.000
methane.
But you see two because

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:55.000
methane, the molecule has two
molecular orbital energy levels,

00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:57.000
one of them being triply
degenerate.

00:45:57.907 --> 00:46:00.000
See you on Wednesday.

00:00:22.065 --> 00:00:23.690
MICHAEL SHORT: I
think I might actually

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:27.350
use all 16 colors today.

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:29.330
Oh no, this is the
most satisfying day.

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:33.260
Whereas Tuesday was probably
the most mathematically intense,

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.632
because we developed
this equation right here,

00:00:35.632 --> 00:00:37.340
today is going to be
the most satisfying,

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.280
because we are going to cancel
out just about every term,

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.940
leaving a homogeneous, infinite
reactor criticality condition.

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:45.860
So we will go over
today, how do you

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.970
go from this, to what is
criticality in a reactor?

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:54.680
So I want to get a couple
of variables up over here

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.440
to remind you guys.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.330
We had this variable
flux of r, e,

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:05.300
omega, t in the
number of neutrons

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.020
per centimeter squared
per second traveling

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.120
through something.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.060
And we also had its
corresponding non-angular

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.980
dependent term, on just
r, e, t, if we don't care

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.110
what angle things go through.

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.990
We've got a corresponding
variable called current.

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.290
So I'll put this as flux.

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:38.720
We have current j, r, e, omega,
t, and its corresponding,

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.390
we don't care about angle form.

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.060
And today, what
we're going to do

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.280
is first go over this
equation again so that we

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.690
understand all of its parts.

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.150
And there are more parts
here than are in the reading.

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:52.710
If you remember,
that's because I

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.100
wanted to show you how all
of these terms are created.

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.600
Just about every
one of these terms,

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.620
except the external source and
the flow through some surface,

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:08.669
has the form of some
multiplier, times the integral

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:12.930
over all possible variables
that we care about,

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:18.750
times a reaction rate d
stuff, where this reaction

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:24.660
rate is always going to be some
cross-section, times some flux.

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.480
So when you look at this
equation using that template,

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.310
it's actually not so bad.

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.130
So let's go through each
of these pieces right here.

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.320
And then we're going to
start simplifying things.

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.180
And this board's going to
look like some sort of rainbow

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.720
explosion.

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.080
But all that's going to be
left is a much simpler form

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.940
of the neutron
diffusion equation.

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.810
So we've got our
time-dependent term right here,

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.300
where I've stuck in
this variable flux,

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.700
instead of the
number of neutrons n,

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.360
because we know that flux
is the number of neutrons,

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.600
times the speed at
which they're moving.

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.850
And just to check
our units, flux

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:04.450
should be in neutrons per
centimeters squared per second.

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:11.100
And n is in neutrons
per cubic centimeter.

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:17.120
And velocity is in
centimeters per second.

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.160
So the units check out.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.380
That's why I made that
substitution right there.

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:24.830
And this way, everything is in
terms of little fi, the flux.

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:26.240
We have our first term here.

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:29.120
I think I'll have
a labeling color.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.720
That'll make things a
little easier to understand.

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.450
Which is due to
regular old fission.

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.650
In this case, we have new,
the number of neutrons created

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:44.570
per fission, times chi, the
sort of fission birth spectrum,

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:47.840
or at what energy the
neutrons are born.

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.630
Over 4pi would account for all
different angles in which they

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:54.680
could go out, times the integral
over our whole control volume,

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.265
and all other
energies in angles.

00:03:57.265 --> 00:03:58.640
If you remember
now, we're trying

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:03.500
to track the number of neutrons
in some small energy group, e,

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.940
traveling in some
small direction, omega.

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:09.110
And those have little
vector things on it

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:12.417
at some specific position
as a function of time.

00:04:12.417 --> 00:04:14.750
So in order to figure out how
many neutrons are entering

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:16.820
our group from fission,
we need to know,

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:18.589
what are all the
fissions happening

00:04:18.589 --> 00:04:20.310
in all the other groups?

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:22.730
I've also escalated this
problem a little bit

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:26.060
to not assume that the
reactor's homogeneous.

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:29.330
So I've added an r, or
a spatial dependence

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.528
for every cross-section
here, which

00:04:31.528 --> 00:04:33.320
means that as you move
through the reactor,

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.030
you might encounter
different materials.

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:37.250
You almost certainly
will, unless your reactor

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:38.470
has been in a blender.

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:40.790
So except for that
case, you would actually

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:44.390
have different cross sections in
different parts of the reactor.

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:45.890
So all of a sudden,
this is starting

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:48.830
to get awfully interesting,
or messy depending on what

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:50.150
you want to think about it.

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:52.760
There is the external
source, which is actually

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:55.910
a real phenomenon,
because reactors

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:59.430
do stick in those californium
kickstarter sources.

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.040
So for some amount
of time, there

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.140
is an external
source of neutrons,

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:06.050
giving them out with some
positional energy angle

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:08.260
and time dependence.

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.270
So let's call this the
kickstarter source.

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:19.720
There's this term right
here, the nin reactions.

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:25.550
So these are other reactions
where it's absorb a neutron,

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:29.420
and give off anywhere
between 2 and 4 neutrons.

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:31.460
Beyond that, it's
just not energetically

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:33.230
possible in a fission reactor.

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:34.880
But don't undergo fission.

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:37.730
They have their own cross
sections, their own birth

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:38.720
spectrum.

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:40.610
And I've stuck in
something right here,

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:43.460
if we have summing over all
possible i, where you have

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:48.920
this reaction be n in reaction,
where 1 neutron goes in,

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:50.790
and i neutrons come out.

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:53.450
You've got to multiply
by the number of neutrons

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:54.840
per reaction.

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:57.060
For fission, that was new.

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:59.875
For an nin reaction,
that's just i.

00:05:59.875 --> 00:06:01.500
But otherwise, the
term looks the same.

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:05.490
You have your multiplier,
your birth spectrum, your 4pi,

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:08.730
your integral over stuff,
your unique cross-section,

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:10.530
and the flux.

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:12.920
And these two together
give you a reaction rate.

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:15.740
I've just written all of the
differentials as d stuff,

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:17.840
because it takes a lot
of time to write those

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:19.450
over and over again.

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:26.050
And then we have our
photo fission term,

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:28.520
where gamma rays of
sufficiently high energy

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:32.000
can also induce fission
external to the neutrons.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.140
The term looks exactly the same.

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:36.350
There's going to be some
new for photofission,

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:38.510
some birth spectrum
for photofission,

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:41.090
some cross section for
photofission, and the same flux

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:43.430
that we're using
everywhere else.

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:53.120
Then we had what's called the in
scattering term, where neutrons

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:55.760
can undergo scattering,
lose some energy,

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:58.880
and enter our group
from somewhere else.

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:01.400
That's why we have
those en omega primes,

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:03.110
because it's some
other energy group.

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:06.320
And we have to account for
all of those energy groups.

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:08.570
That's why we have
this integral there.

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:10.470
And it looks very much the same.

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:12.530
There's a scattering
cross-section.

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:16.080
And that should actually
be an e prime right there.

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:17.570
Make sure I'm not
missing any more

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:21.110
of those inside the integral.

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:26.480
That's all good.

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:29.000
That's a prime, good.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.020
There's also a flux.

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:32.180
And then there was this
probability function

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:35.780
that a given neutron
starting off an energy

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:38.926
e prime omega prime,
ends up scattering into r

00:07:38.926 --> 00:07:40.460
energy, e and omega.

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:44.130
So this would be the other one.

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:47.100
And this would be r group.

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:50.530
But otherwise, the term
looks very much the same.

00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:53.310
And that takes care of all
the possible gains of neutrons

00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:54.630
into r group.

00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:56.680
The losses are a
fair bit simpler.

00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:00.490
There is reaction of
absolutely any kind.

00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:08.770
Let's say this would be the
total cross-section, which

00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:11.380
says that if a neutron
undergoes any reaction at all,

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:16.120
it's going to lose energy and
go out of our energy group d, e.

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:17.770
Notice here that these are all--

00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:20.320
these energies and omega
is our all r group,

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:22.750
because we only care about
how many neutrons in r group

00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:24.940
undergo a reaction and leave.

00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:26.710
And the form is very simple--

00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:31.130
integrate over volume,
energy, and direction,

00:08:31.130 --> 00:08:33.700
times a cross-section,
times a flux,

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:35.559
just like all the other ones.

00:08:35.559 --> 00:08:37.420
Then the only difference
in one right here

00:08:37.420 --> 00:08:38.545
is what we'll call leakage.

00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:46.120
These are neutrons moving
out of whatever control

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:47.370
surface that we're looking at.

00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:53.790
And this can be some arbitrarily
complex control surface in 3D.

00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:55.770
I don't really know how
to draw a blob in 3D.

00:08:55.770 --> 00:08:58.380
But at every point
on that blob, there's

00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:00.510
going to be a normal vector.

00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:05.340
And you can then take the
current of neutrons traveling

00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:08.280
out that normal vector, and
figure out how much of that

00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:11.340
is actually leaving
our surface ds.

00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:13.620
The one problem we had
is that everything here

00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:18.000
is in terms of volume,
volume, volume, surface.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.770
So we don't have
all the same terms,

00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:22.410
because once we have everything
in the same variables

00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:26.190
we can start to make some
pretty crazy simplifications.

00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:33.830
The last thing we did is we
invoked the divergence theorem,

00:09:33.830 --> 00:09:39.100
that says that the surface
integral of some variable FdS

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:43.750
is the same as the volume
integral of the divergence

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:47.167
of that variable dV.

00:09:47.167 --> 00:09:49.250
So I remember there was
some snickering last time,

00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:51.125
because you probably
haven't seen this since,

00:09:51.125 --> 00:09:53.140
was it 1801 or 1802?

00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:56.480
1802, OK, that makes sense,
because divergence usually

00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:59.060
has more than one variable
associated with it.

00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:00.560
I'll include the
dot, because that's

00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:02.450
what makes that divergence.

00:10:02.450 --> 00:10:05.790
So we can then
rewrite this term.

00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:08.120
Let's start our
simplification colors.

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:11.210
That's our divergence theorem.

00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:14.890
So let's get rid
of it in this form,

00:10:14.890 --> 00:10:19.150
and call it minus integral
over all that stuff.

00:10:21.970 --> 00:10:30.140
Then we'll have
dot, little j, to be

00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:40.790
careful, r, e, omega, t, d soft.

00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:43.290
So for every step, I"m going
to use a different color so you

00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:48.407
can see which simplification led
to how much crossing stuff out.

00:10:48.407 --> 00:10:49.990
And so like I said,
this board's going

00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:51.330
to look like a
rainbow explosion.

00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:52.872
But then we'll
rewrite it at the end.

00:10:52.872 --> 00:10:54.820
And it's going to look
a whole lot simpler.

00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:59.437
So now, let's start making
some simplifications.

00:10:59.437 --> 00:11:01.270
Let's say you're an
actual reactor designer,

00:11:01.270 --> 00:11:04.000
and all you care about is
how many neutrons are here.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.650
Of the variables
here, which one do you

00:11:05.650 --> 00:11:07.060
think we care the least about?

00:11:10.270 --> 00:11:12.732
Angle, I mean do we really
care which direction

00:11:12.732 --> 00:11:13.690
the neutrons are going?

00:11:13.690 --> 00:11:15.820
No, we pretty much
care, where are they?

00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:18.400
And are they causing
fission or getting absorbed?

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:20.970
So let's start our
simplification board.

00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:26.200
And in blue, we'll
neglect angle.

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:28.120
This is where it
starts to get fun.

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:32.440
So in this case, we'll just
perform the omega integral

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:33.880
over all angles.

00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:36.610
We just neglect angle here.

00:11:36.610 --> 00:11:41.170
We forget the omega
integral, forget omega there.

00:11:41.170 --> 00:11:44.830
Away goes the 4pi, because we've
integrated overall 4pi star

00:11:44.830 --> 00:11:47.200
radians, or all solid angle.

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:48.400
Let's just keep going.

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:51.100
Forget the 4pi,
forget the omega,

00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:57.490
forget the omega, forget the 4pi
and the omega, and the omega.

00:11:57.490 --> 00:12:01.690
Same thing here-- forget the
omega in the scattering kernel,

00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:04.420
forget it in the
flux, forget it there,

00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:09.300
forget it there,
and there as well.

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:12.775
OK, we've now completely
eliminated one variable.

00:12:12.775 --> 00:12:14.650
And all we had to do is
ditch the 4pi and one

00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:17.670
of the integrals.

00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:18.300
What next?

00:12:20.970 --> 00:12:23.370
We're tracking right now
every possible position,

00:12:23.370 --> 00:12:26.280
every possible energy,
at every possible time.

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:29.280
If you want to know,
what is your flux

00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:33.400
going to be in the reactor
at steady state, what

00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:35.440
variable do you attack next?

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:36.520
Time.

00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:38.950
So let's just say this
reactor is at steady state.

00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:45.140
That's going to
invoke a few things.

00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:50.250
For one, it's going to ditch
the entire steady state term.

00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:54.240
We're going to get rid of
all the ts in all the fluxes.

00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:58.220
This shouldn't take
too long to do.

00:12:58.220 --> 00:13:00.960
I think that's all of them.

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:03.930
And the third thing is if this
reactor is at steady state,

00:13:03.930 --> 00:13:07.420
chances are we've taken
our kickstarter source out,

00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:09.230
because we just needed
it to get it going.

00:13:09.230 --> 00:13:11.710
But the reactor should
be self-sustaining

00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:13.310
once it's at steady state.

00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:17.530
So let's just get rid
of our source term.

00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:19.700
I just want to make sure
I didn't miss any here.

00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:26.080
OK, next up, let's
go with green.

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:28.590
What else do you think we can
simplify about this problem?

00:13:34.710 --> 00:13:37.370
Well, if you look far enough
away from the reactor,

00:13:37.370 --> 00:13:40.700
we can make an assumption
that the reactor

00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:42.500
is roughly homogeneous.

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:47.960
In some cases, it's not
so good of an assumption,

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:51.950
like very close to anything
that has a huge absorption

00:13:51.950 --> 00:13:53.200
cross-section.

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:55.490
Now, I want to explain
the physics behind this.

00:13:55.490 --> 00:13:57.890
If the neutrons travel
a very long distance

00:13:57.890 --> 00:14:01.640
through any group of
materials, then those materials

00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:05.900
will appear to be roughly
homogeneous to the neutrons.

00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:08.900
If, however, the neutrons
travel through something that's

00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:11.510
very different from the
materials around it,

00:14:11.510 --> 00:14:14.500
then that homogeneous
assumption breaks down.

00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:17.810
So in what locations in a
nuclear reactor do you think

00:14:17.810 --> 00:14:22.770
you cannot treat the
system as homogeneous?

00:14:22.770 --> 00:14:24.270
Where do the
properties of materials

00:14:24.270 --> 00:14:26.260
suddenly change
by a huge amount?

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:26.760
Yeah, Luke?

00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:27.420
AUDIENCE: Control rods.

00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:29.130
MICHAEL SHORT:
Control rods, right,

00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:34.515
so let's say it's
bad for control rods.

00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:39.740
Where else?

00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:49.538
How about the fuel?

00:14:49.538 --> 00:14:51.330
All of a sudden, you're
moving from a bunch

00:14:51.330 --> 00:14:54.420
of structural materials
where sigma fission equals 0,

00:14:54.420 --> 00:14:57.180
to the fuel where sigma fission,
like you saw on the test,

00:14:57.180 --> 00:14:59.940
can be like 500 barns,
which even though it's

00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:02.080
got a very small
exponent in front of it,

00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:04.500
10 to the minus 22
centimeters squared,

00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:06.910
it's still pretty significant.

00:15:06.910 --> 00:15:10.020
So this assumption breaks
down around the control rods

00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:11.325
and around the fuel.

00:15:11.325 --> 00:15:12.450
But we can get around this.

00:15:12.450 --> 00:15:15.960
Let's analyze the simplest,
craziest possible reactor,

00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:18.270
which would be a molten
salt fueled reactor.

00:15:18.270 --> 00:15:21.360
It's just a blob
of 700 Celsius goo

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:25.140
that's got its fuel, coolant,
and control rods all built in.

00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:28.740
So if we assume that the
reactor is homogeneous, which

00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:31.410
is a pretty good
assumption for molten salt

00:15:31.410 --> 00:15:33.870
fueled reactors,
because the fuel's

00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:35.460
dissolved in the coolant.

00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:37.590
And it builds up its own
fission product poison.

00:15:37.590 --> 00:15:41.250
So it's got some of its own
control rods kind of built in.

00:15:41.250 --> 00:15:44.010
Usually, we'll have other
extra ones too, but whatever.

00:15:44.010 --> 00:15:47.480
Then we can start to
really simplify things.

00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:52.200
If we get rid of any
homogeneity assumptions,

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:55.860
we cannot necessarily get
rid of the r in the flux,

00:15:55.860 --> 00:15:58.890
because even if the reactor's
homogeneous it still might have

00:15:58.890 --> 00:16:00.330
boundaries.

00:16:00.330 --> 00:16:02.100
So you might be able
to approximate it

00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:09.060
as just a cylinder or a
slab of uniform materials.

00:16:12.490 --> 00:16:17.610
But if we were to get rid of
the r's in the flux term, that

00:16:17.610 --> 00:16:22.260
would mean that as we graph
flux as a function of distance,

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:28.052
it would look like that,
including infinitely far away

00:16:28.052 --> 00:16:28.760
from the reactor.

00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:30.970
Now, is was that true?

00:16:30.970 --> 00:16:36.200
Absolutely not, so I don't want
to leave that up for anyone.

00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:40.640
We'll fill in what these graphs
look like a little later,

00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:43.820
just leave them there for now.

00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:47.460
We can get rid of some
of the other r's though,

00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:49.530
like these cross sections.

00:16:49.530 --> 00:16:51.780
If the reactor is
actually homogeneous,

00:16:51.780 --> 00:16:54.630
then the cross section
is the same everywhere

00:16:54.630 --> 00:16:57.000
because the materials
are the same everywhere.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.290
So we can get rid of the
r's here, the r's here,

00:17:01.290 --> 00:17:04.109
and there, and there.

00:17:04.109 --> 00:17:07.500
And that's it, I think.

00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:09.510
I don't think I
missed any, good.

00:17:12.369 --> 00:17:18.220
Next up-- if this
reactor is homogeneous,

00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:21.650
then does it really
matter at which location

00:17:21.650 --> 00:17:25.060
we're taking this balance?

00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:27.609
Does it really matter
which little volume

00:17:27.609 --> 00:17:30.070
element we're looking at?

00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:32.320
We say these equations are--

00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:39.490
we'll call them volume
identical, which

00:17:39.490 --> 00:17:41.830
means if this same
equation is satisfied

00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:44.200
at any point in the
reactor, we don't

00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:47.127
need to do the volume integral
over the whole reactor.

00:17:47.127 --> 00:17:49.210
It's not like it's going
to change anywhere we go.

00:17:49.210 --> 00:17:54.140
So forget the volume integrals.

00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:56.800
Hopefully, you guys see
where I'm going with this.

00:17:56.800 --> 00:18:00.730
And I've never tried teaching
it like this rainbow explosion

00:18:00.730 --> 00:18:01.230
before.

00:18:01.230 --> 00:18:04.470
But I'm kind of excited
to see how it turns out.

00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:09.700
So already like 2/3 of the stuff
that we had written are gone.

00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:13.930
What's the only variable
left that we can go after?

00:18:13.930 --> 00:18:17.410
What's the only color left
that I haven't really used?

00:18:17.410 --> 00:18:22.450
Energy, so we can make a couple
of different assumptions.

00:18:22.450 --> 00:18:27.070
This equation as it is not yet
really analytically solvable,

00:18:27.070 --> 00:18:30.040
because a lot of these
energy dependent terms

00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:32.290
don't have analytical
solutions, or even

00:18:32.290 --> 00:18:34.900
forms like the cross sections.

00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:37.015
But we can start
attacking energy.

00:18:41.180 --> 00:18:43.430
Hopefully, this is
different enough from white.

00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:48.880
Yeah, is that big enough
difference for you guys to see?

00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:52.687
Good, OK, we can start doing
this in a few different ways.

00:18:52.687 --> 00:18:54.020
I want to mention what they are.

00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:56.410
And then we're going
to do the easiest one.

00:18:56.410 --> 00:18:59.620
So the way it's done for real,
like in the computational

00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:01.540
reactor physics
group, is you can

00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:15.750
discretize the energy into a
bunch of little energy groups.

00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:19.890
So you can write this equation
for every little energy group,

00:19:19.890 --> 00:19:21.990
and assume that along
this energy scale,

00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:27.600
ranging from your maximum energy
to probably thermal energy--

00:19:32.410 --> 00:19:36.305
025, let's do this
clearly with thick chalk.

00:19:40.010 --> 00:19:42.100
There we go.

00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:47.680
You can then discretize into
some little energy group.

00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:55.950
Let's say that's egi, that's egi
plus 1, and so on, and so on.

00:19:55.950 --> 00:19:58.450
And depending on the type of
reactor that you're looking at,

00:19:58.450 --> 00:20:00.760
and the energy
resolution that you need,

00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:03.610
you choose the number of
energy groups accordingly.

00:20:03.610 --> 00:20:05.840
Does anyone happen to know
for a light water reactor,

00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:07.810
how many energy groups
do you think we need

00:20:07.810 --> 00:20:09.600
to model a light water reactor?

00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:17.060
The answer might surprise you.

00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:19.640
It's just two, actually.

00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:21.350
All we care about--

00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:25.730
so let's say this would
be for the general case.

00:20:25.730 --> 00:20:28.720
All we care about for
a light water reactor

00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:32.635
is, are your neutrons thermal?

00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:37.985
Or are they not?

00:20:37.985 --> 00:20:39.360
Because the neutrons
that are not

00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:42.705
thermal are not contributing
to fission that much.

00:20:42.705 --> 00:20:43.830
They are just a little bit.

00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:45.360
And you can account for those.

00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:46.950
But pretty much, they're not.

00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:50.640
Once the neutron slowdown down
to get thermal, in the range

00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:55.620
from, let's say, about an
EV to that temperature--

00:20:55.620 --> 00:20:58.650
took a surprising amount of time
to write with sidewalk chalk--

00:20:58.650 --> 00:21:01.350
then you've got things that
are about 500 or 1,000 times

00:21:01.350 --> 00:21:03.360
more likely to undergo fission.

00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:06.810
And so all you care about is
the neutrons are all born.

00:21:06.810 --> 00:21:08.850
They're all born
right about here.

00:21:08.850 --> 00:21:10.800
And they scatter,
and bounce around.

00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:12.510
And you don't care,
because they're just

00:21:12.510 --> 00:21:14.215
in this not thermal region.

00:21:14.215 --> 00:21:15.840
And when they enter
the thermal region,

00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:18.173
you start tracking them,
because those are the ones that

00:21:18.173 --> 00:21:20.020
really count for fission.

00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:23.320
And if you actually look up the
specifications for the AP 1000,

00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:25.450
this is a modern reactor
under construction

00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:27.580
in many different
places in the world.

00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:30.370
When you see, how do they
do the neutron analysis?

00:21:30.370 --> 00:21:32.150
Two group approximation.

00:21:32.150 --> 00:21:34.150
So this isn't just
an academic exercise

00:21:34.150 --> 00:21:36.610
to make it easier for
sophomores to understand.

00:21:36.610 --> 00:21:39.310
This is actually something
that's done for real reactors.

00:21:39.310 --> 00:21:41.830
So if you ever felt like
I'm making it too simple,

00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:44.940
no, no, no, I'm simplifying
it down to what's really done.

00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:46.810
And I will get you
that specification so

00:21:46.810 --> 00:21:49.270
you can see what
Westinghouse says, like,

00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:50.980
this is how we
design the reactor.

00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:54.980
We made a two group
simplification in many cases.

00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:57.730
So you can discretize.

00:21:57.730 --> 00:22:02.400
You can forget it, which we're
going to call the one group

00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:05.660
approximation.

00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:08.630
Or you can-- let's say two group
is the other one that we're

00:22:08.630 --> 00:22:12.280
actually going to tackle.

00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:15.530
We're going to do this
one, forget energy.

00:22:15.530 --> 00:22:18.440
But we're not really
going to forget energy,

00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:22.340
because you can't
just pick an energy,

00:22:22.340 --> 00:22:25.760
and pick a cross-section,
and say, OK,

00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:28.190
that's the cross section
we're going to use.

00:22:28.190 --> 00:22:34.430
If most cross sections
have the following form--

00:22:34.430 --> 00:22:38.510
if this is log of energy,
and this is log of sigma,

00:22:38.510 --> 00:22:46.420
and it goes something like
that, what energy do you pick?

00:22:46.420 --> 00:22:46.920
Go ahead.

00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:47.420
Tell me.

00:22:47.420 --> 00:22:48.810
Which energy do you pick?

00:22:48.810 --> 00:22:52.190
Anyone want to wager a guess?

00:22:52.190 --> 00:22:55.210
AUDIENCE: The ones before
or after the big squigglies.

00:22:55.210 --> 00:22:57.917
MICHAEL SHORT: The ones before
or after the big squiggles.

00:22:57.917 --> 00:23:00.250
I don't think that's correct,
because if you do it this,

00:23:00.250 --> 00:23:02.320
then you're going away
underestimate fission.

00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:04.120
If you do it here, you're going
to way overestimate fission,

00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:05.950
or whatever other
reaction you have.

00:23:05.950 --> 00:23:08.110
We didn't say which
reaction this is.

00:23:08.110 --> 00:23:10.360
The rest of you who are
silent and afraid to speak up,

00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:12.680
you're actually correct.

00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:15.440
I wouldn't actually pick
any single value here.

00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:20.320
What you need to do is find some
sort of average cross-section

00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:22.900
for whatever reaction
that accurately

00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:24.700
represents the
number of reactions

00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:26.470
happening in the system.

00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:29.290
And in order to do that, you
have to come up with some

00:23:29.290 --> 00:23:32.500
average cross-section for
whatever reaction you have

00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:39.370
by integrating over your whole
energy range of the energy

00:23:39.370 --> 00:23:45.930
dependent cross-section
as a function of energy,

00:23:45.930 --> 00:23:50.800
times your flux de over--

00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:52.660
does this look
familiar from 1801 or 2

00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:57.240
as well, what's the average
value of some function?

00:23:57.240 --> 00:23:58.280
Little bit?

00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:00.350
Well, we'll bring
it back here now.

00:24:03.470 --> 00:24:05.930
So retrieve it from cold
storage in your memories,

00:24:05.930 --> 00:24:09.590
because this is how actual
cross sections are averaged.

00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:11.915
For whatever energy
range you're picking--

00:24:11.915 --> 00:24:13.790
I'm going to make this
a little more general.

00:24:13.790 --> 00:24:15.470
I won't say zero.

00:24:15.470 --> 00:24:18.110
I'll just say your minimum
energy for your group.

00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:26.460
So now, this equation is general
for the multi group and the one

00:24:26.460 --> 00:24:28.560
group and two group method.

00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:31.160
For whatever cross-section
you want to pick

00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:33.120
and whatever energy
range you're looking at,

00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:37.820
you take the actual data
and perform an average

00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:40.640
for the fast and
thermal delineation,

00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:45.800
where, let's say this is
fast and this is thermal,

00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:47.450
you would have two
different averages.

00:24:47.450 --> 00:24:50.287
Maybe this average
would be right there.

00:24:50.287 --> 00:24:50.870
You know what?

00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:55.880
Let's use white so it
actually has some contrast.

00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:59.210
So this would be one value
of the cross-section.

00:24:59.210 --> 00:25:02.000
And maybe the next average
would be right there.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:06.140
So you simplify this
absolutely non analytical form

00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:08.100
of your complicated
cross-section

00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:10.070
to just a couple of values.

00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:15.290
Maybe we'll call that
average sigma fast.

00:25:15.290 --> 00:25:19.925
And we'll call that
average sigma thermal.

00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:28.580
So using this analogy
and this color,

00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:31.310
we can then say,
we're going to take

00:25:31.310 --> 00:25:35.900
an average new, an average
chi, get rid of the energies,

00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:38.030
because we can perform
the same energy average

00:25:38.030 --> 00:25:42.000
integration on every quantity
with energy dependence.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:43.910
So all we do is we
put a bar there,

00:25:43.910 --> 00:25:47.270
ditch the energies,
ditch the energies.

00:25:47.270 --> 00:25:50.910
And let's just say that flux
is going to be what it is.

00:25:50.910 --> 00:25:55.330
Same thing here--
yeah, same thing there,

00:25:55.330 --> 00:26:00.710
and there, and there, there,
there, there, here, and here,

00:26:00.710 --> 00:26:01.832
and here.

00:26:01.832 --> 00:26:03.040
And there is a cross-section.

00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:04.480
There is an energy.

00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:06.450
There is an energy.

00:26:06.450 --> 00:26:07.550
There is a cross-section.

00:26:07.550 --> 00:26:09.470
We don't care about
those anymore.

00:26:09.470 --> 00:26:13.250
And there's a couple of other
implications of this energy

00:26:13.250 --> 00:26:14.601
simplification.

00:26:26.150 --> 00:26:28.960
What is the birth spectrum now?

00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:30.700
What's the probability
that a neutron

00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:35.430
is born in our energy group
which contains all energies?

00:26:35.430 --> 00:26:43.700
1, OK, so forget the chi,
and that one, and that one.

00:26:43.700 --> 00:26:45.380
And what about this
scattering kernel?

00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:48.740
What's the probability
that a neutron scatters

00:26:48.740 --> 00:26:51.260
from any other energy which
is already in our group

00:26:51.260 --> 00:26:54.988
into our group, which
contains all energies?

00:26:54.988 --> 00:26:56.856
AUDIENCE: 1.

00:26:56.856 --> 00:26:58.900
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah,
scattering no longer

00:26:58.900 --> 00:27:01.570
matters when you do the
one group approximation,

00:27:01.570 --> 00:27:03.970
because if the neutron
loses some of its energy,

00:27:03.970 --> 00:27:06.520
it's still in our energy
group, because our energy

00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:08.680
group contains all energies.

00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:14.490
So forget the scattering kernel.

00:27:14.490 --> 00:27:18.910
And forget the energy integrals.

00:27:18.910 --> 00:27:21.920
What are we actually left with?

00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:23.750
Not much.

00:27:23.750 --> 00:27:25.810
There's no green in here yet.

00:27:25.810 --> 00:27:27.560
Good, because I need
to do one more thing.

00:27:30.380 --> 00:27:31.400
There is no more green.

00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:32.210
Oh, we did green.

00:27:32.210 --> 00:27:32.870
We did time.

00:27:32.870 --> 00:27:37.650
OK, green, red, orange--
is this the orange I used?

00:27:37.650 --> 00:27:38.900
Dammit.

00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:40.650
OK, we use those.

00:27:40.650 --> 00:27:42.120
Purple, no, we've used it.

00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:43.650
Oh my God.

00:27:43.650 --> 00:27:46.230
We've used both blues.

00:27:46.230 --> 00:27:47.600
Bright yellow.

00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:48.340
Yeah?

00:27:48.340 --> 00:27:49.215
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:49.215 --> 00:27:50.370
MICHAEL SHORT: Yes.

00:27:50.370 --> 00:27:52.590
Chi is the fission
birth spectrum,

00:27:52.590 --> 00:27:56.250
the probability that a neutron
is born at any given energy.

00:27:56.250 --> 00:27:59.250
But because all neutrons are
born in our energy group, which

00:27:59.250 --> 00:28:02.632
contains all energies, then that
just becomes one and goes away.

00:28:02.632 --> 00:28:04.590
There's no birth spectrum,
because they're just

00:28:04.590 --> 00:28:05.730
born in our group.

00:28:05.730 --> 00:28:07.380
Does that makes sense?

00:28:07.380 --> 00:28:11.310
OK, I think I found the actual
only color, besides black

00:28:11.310 --> 00:28:15.180
on a black chalkboard, and
white which we already have,

00:28:15.180 --> 00:28:16.440
that I have left.

00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:18.343
We also have a slightly
darker shade of gray.

00:28:18.343 --> 00:28:19.260
But I'm literally out.

00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:23.607
This worked out awesome,
because there's one more thing

00:28:23.607 --> 00:28:24.690
that we want to deal with.

00:28:28.730 --> 00:28:30.470
What do we even have left?

00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:33.410
All right, what is
the one term that

00:28:33.410 --> 00:28:35.900
is not in all of the same
variables as the others?

00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:41.660
That current, that j.

00:28:41.660 --> 00:28:43.040
What do we do about that?

00:28:46.450 --> 00:28:47.880
So we're going-- sorry?

00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:50.362
AUDIENCE: The F e to e.

00:28:50.362 --> 00:28:51.570
MICHAEL SHORT: The F e to e--

00:28:51.570 --> 00:28:54.720
so, actually, I'll recreate
some of our variables

00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:57.690
here, because there's
a lot of them.

00:28:57.690 --> 00:29:02.610
So our F of e prime
to e is what's

00:29:02.610 --> 00:29:03.960
called the scattering kernel.

00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:12.050
And that's the
probability that a neutron

00:29:12.050 --> 00:29:14.690
scatters from some other
energy group, e prime,

00:29:14.690 --> 00:29:18.110
into ours in e about de.

00:29:18.110 --> 00:29:22.790
And chi of e is the
fission birth spectrum.

00:29:30.180 --> 00:29:34.070
And just for
completeness, knew of e

00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:41.474
is our neutron multiplier,
or neutrons per fission.

00:29:41.474 --> 00:29:44.040
And I think that gives a
pretty complete explanation

00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:45.450
of what's up here.

00:29:45.450 --> 00:29:48.120
So now, let's figure out how
to deal with the current term.

00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:51.450
This is when we make one of
the biggest approximations

00:29:51.450 --> 00:29:54.120
here, and go from what's
called the neutron transport

00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:56.550
equation, which is a fully
accurate physical model

00:29:56.550 --> 00:30:00.100
of what's really going on, to
the neutron diffusion equation.

00:30:06.990 --> 00:30:09.180
And this is where
it gets really fun.

00:30:09.180 --> 00:30:12.750
You don't assume that neutrons
are subatomic particles that

00:30:12.750 --> 00:30:15.630
are whizzing about and knocking
off of everything else.

00:30:15.630 --> 00:30:18.930
You then treat the neutrons
kind of like a gas,

00:30:18.930 --> 00:30:20.520
or like a chemical.

00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:23.870
And you just say that it
follows the laws of diffusion.

00:30:23.870 --> 00:30:27.240
Again, this works out very
well, except for places

00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:30.390
where cross sections suddenly
change, like near control

00:30:30.390 --> 00:30:31.890
rods or near fuel.

00:30:31.890 --> 00:30:33.750
But for most of the
reactor, especially

00:30:33.750 --> 00:30:36.240
if we have a molten
salt fuel reactor,

00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:39.190
we can invoke what's
called Fick's law.

00:30:39.190 --> 00:30:42.330
Does this sound
familiar to anyone?

00:30:42.330 --> 00:30:49.020
Fick's law diffusion,
3091 or 5111.

00:30:49.020 --> 00:30:51.480
It's the change of a
chemical down a density

00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:52.720
or a concentration gradient.

00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:55.950
So, yeah, you've got the idea.

00:30:55.950 --> 00:30:59.190
What Fick's law says
is that the current--

00:30:59.190 --> 00:31:01.410
or let's say the diffusion
current or the neutron

00:31:01.410 --> 00:31:02.470
current--

00:31:02.470 --> 00:31:05.160
is going to be equal
to some diffusion

00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:09.500
coefficient, times the
gradient of whatever

00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:11.090
chemical concentration
you've got.

00:31:11.090 --> 00:31:14.830
Let me put the c in there.

00:31:14.830 --> 00:31:16.585
So right here, this
would be the current.

00:31:16.585 --> 00:31:18.730
I'll label it in
a different color.

00:31:21.780 --> 00:31:26.200
This would be your
variable of interest.

00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:33.180
Maybe c is for concentration,
or phi is for flux.

00:31:33.180 --> 00:31:37.070
Oh, that reminds me, where
are those bars on our flux?

00:31:37.070 --> 00:31:38.080
Which term did we do?

00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:42.740
Energy-- where's my slightly
lighter blue over here?

00:31:42.740 --> 00:31:48.880
All of these phi's
become capital,

00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:51.280
because we've gotten rid of
all the angular, and energy,

00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:52.840
and everything dependence.

00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:55.950
Oh, angular dependence--
neglect omega,

00:31:55.950 --> 00:31:57.390
that should be dark blue.

00:32:02.549 --> 00:32:05.810
Omega goes away.

00:32:05.810 --> 00:32:07.340
And the fluxes become capital.

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.940
So many terms to keep track of.

00:32:12.940 --> 00:32:15.430
Luckily, you will never have to.

00:32:15.430 --> 00:32:18.120
And then the j
becomes a capital J.

00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:21.630
Did I miss any phi's here?

00:32:21.630 --> 00:32:25.300
No, because that one
was already gone, cool.

00:32:25.300 --> 00:32:27.730
All right, so we
can use Fick's law,

00:32:27.730 --> 00:32:31.893
and transform the current into
something related to flux.

00:32:31.893 --> 00:32:34.060
And what we're saying here
is that we're getting rid

00:32:34.060 --> 00:32:36.620
of the true physics, which is
that there's some fixed neutron

00:32:36.620 --> 00:32:37.120
current.

00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:40.720
And we're saying that neutrons
behave kind of like a gas,

00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:42.730
or a chemical in solution.

00:32:42.730 --> 00:32:49.120
And so in yellow, we can ditch
our current related term,

00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:50.920
and rewrite it.

00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:56.780
We don't have any integrals
left, as negative del squared

00:32:56.780 --> 00:32:58.790
phi.

00:32:58.790 --> 00:33:07.220
I think the only variable
left is r, not too bad.

00:33:07.220 --> 00:33:10.780
Now, we have a second
order linear differential

00:33:10.780 --> 00:33:14.250
equation describing the flow
of neutrons in the system.

00:33:14.250 --> 00:33:15.700
And so we actually
have something

00:33:15.700 --> 00:33:18.760
that we can solve for flux.

00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:21.620
I think it's time to rewrite it.

00:33:21.620 --> 00:33:22.880
Wouldn't you say?

00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:24.260
This has been fun.

00:33:24.260 --> 00:33:28.640
So let's rewrite what's left.

00:33:31.830 --> 00:33:34.740
Make sure you guys can
actually see everything there.

00:33:34.740 --> 00:33:36.910
We'll write it in
boring old white.

00:33:36.910 --> 00:33:41.040
So we have no
transient dependence.

00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:50.630
We have left sigma fission,
times flux, as a function of r.

00:33:50.630 --> 00:34:01.890
No source, and we have our
neutron nin reactions of--

00:34:01.890 --> 00:34:05.790
oh, we forgot our
new sigma fission.

00:34:05.790 --> 00:34:12.954
Then we have our i sigma
fission from nin, times flux.

00:34:15.929 --> 00:34:20.340
Next term, we have photofission.

00:34:20.340 --> 00:34:24.420
So we have a new,
from gamma rays,

00:34:24.420 --> 00:34:28.580
times sigma fission from
gamma rays, times flux.

00:34:31.179 --> 00:34:32.350
Next up, we have--

00:34:32.350 --> 00:34:35.770
well, last
simplification to make.

00:34:35.770 --> 00:34:37.230
We have scattering.

00:34:37.230 --> 00:34:40.300
And we have total cross-section.

00:34:40.300 --> 00:34:43.030
When we said,
forget about energy,

00:34:43.030 --> 00:34:45.110
and our scattering
kernel becomes one--

00:34:45.110 --> 00:34:47.429
and that's light blue--

00:34:47.429 --> 00:34:51.270
got to make one more
modification to this board.

00:34:55.409 --> 00:35:00.750
Do we care about scattering
at all anymore whatsoever?

00:35:00.750 --> 00:35:03.160
Because scattering doesn't
change the number of neutrons

00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:03.660
left.

00:35:03.660 --> 00:35:09.340
So we can then take
these two terms

00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:18.230
and just call it sigma
absorption, times flux,

00:35:18.230 --> 00:35:22.130
because if we take scattering,
minus the total cross-section,

00:35:22.130 --> 00:35:24.380
it's like saying, all that's
left if you don't scatter

00:35:24.380 --> 00:35:25.910
is you absorb.

00:35:25.910 --> 00:35:30.210
And if you remember, I'll
add to the energy pile,

00:35:30.210 --> 00:35:33.420
we said that our
total cross section

00:35:33.420 --> 00:35:36.150
is scattering, plus absorption.

00:35:36.150 --> 00:35:44.460
And absorption could
be fission and capture.

00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:46.920
And capture could be--

00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:49.650
let's say, capture
with nothing happens,

00:35:49.650 --> 00:35:55.080
plus these nin reactions,
plus any other capture

00:35:55.080 --> 00:35:56.970
reaction that does something.

00:35:56.970 --> 00:35:59.640
So we're going to use this
cross-section identity right

00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:03.330
here with a couple
of minus signs on it.

00:36:03.330 --> 00:36:06.120
And say, well,
scattering minus total,

00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:12.175
leaves you with negative
absorption, to simplify terms.

00:36:15.250 --> 00:36:19.340
I'll leave that up there
for everyone to see.

00:36:19.340 --> 00:36:22.930
So then we have scattering
and total just becomes

00:36:22.930 --> 00:36:31.200
minus sigma absorption,
times phi of r.

00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:32.730
And we're left with--

00:36:32.730 --> 00:36:33.420
what was that?

00:36:33.420 --> 00:36:35.820
Current, that becomes plus.

00:36:38.810 --> 00:36:40.950
There is a d missing
in there, isn't there?

00:36:45.560 --> 00:36:51.250
A yellow d, minus d.

00:36:51.250 --> 00:36:55.210
OK, and that's it.

00:36:55.210 --> 00:36:55.710
Yes?

00:36:55.710 --> 00:36:57.040
AUDIENCE: What is d?

00:36:57.040 --> 00:36:59.160
MICHAEL SHORT: d is the
diffusion coefficient

00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:00.450
right here.

00:37:00.450 --> 00:37:04.110
So we're assuming
that neutrons diffuse

00:37:04.110 --> 00:37:11.690
like a gas or a chemical with
some diffusion coefficient.

00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:16.150
And so we'll define
what that is, oh,

00:37:16.150 --> 00:37:18.580
probably next class, because
we have seven minutes.

00:37:18.580 --> 00:37:19.625
Yeah, Luke?

00:37:19.625 --> 00:37:20.803
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:20.803 --> 00:37:21.720
MICHAEL SHORT: Uh-huh.

00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:25.325
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:25.325 --> 00:37:26.950
MICHAEL SHORT: The
c right here, that's

00:37:26.950 --> 00:37:29.440
whatever variable
we're tracking.

00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:32.140
So let's call that flux.

00:37:32.140 --> 00:37:35.710
Or let's call it n,
the number of neutrons,

00:37:35.710 --> 00:37:41.390
because flux is just number
of neutrons times velocity.

00:37:41.390 --> 00:37:43.270
So let's say that
the concentration was

00:37:43.270 --> 00:37:45.300
the concentration of neutrons.

00:37:45.300 --> 00:37:47.500
And we just multiply by
their velocity to get flux.

00:37:47.500 --> 00:37:50.050
So it's almost like we can
say that the concentration

00:37:50.050 --> 00:37:53.292
of neutrons is directly
related to the flux.

00:37:53.292 --> 00:37:55.000
And that way, we have
everything in flux.

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:59.590
And that's the entire
neutron diffusion equation.

00:38:08.590 --> 00:38:13.050
Yeah, this is for one group
with all the assumptions we

00:38:13.050 --> 00:38:18.710
made right here, homogeneous.

00:38:22.132 --> 00:38:23.590
What other assumptions
did we make?

00:38:23.590 --> 00:38:32.050
Steady state, and we
already neglected that.

00:38:32.050 --> 00:38:35.120
And I think that's enough
qualifiers for this.

00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:37.070
But it's directly
from this equation

00:38:37.070 --> 00:38:39.440
right here that we can
develop what's called

00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:41.450
our criticality condition.

00:38:41.450 --> 00:38:46.750
Under what conditions
is the reactor critical?

00:38:46.750 --> 00:38:48.880
So in this case,
by critical, we're

00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:53.380
going to have some variable
called k effective,

00:38:53.380 --> 00:38:56.290
which defines the
number of neutrons

00:38:56.290 --> 00:39:00.100
produced over the number
of neutrons consumed.

00:39:00.100 --> 00:39:04.480
And if k effective
equals 1, then we

00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:05.890
say that the
reactor is critical.

00:39:09.470 --> 00:39:12.050
That means that exactly the
number of neutrons produced

00:39:12.050 --> 00:39:16.850
by regular fission, nin
reactions, and photofission

00:39:16.850 --> 00:39:19.070
equals exactly the
number of neutrons

00:39:19.070 --> 00:39:23.180
absorbed in the anything,
and that leak out.

00:39:23.180 --> 00:39:27.980
So let's relabel our terms in
the same font that we did here.

00:39:27.980 --> 00:39:31.850
So this would be
the fission term.

00:39:31.850 --> 00:39:35.350
This would be nin reactions.

00:39:35.350 --> 00:39:36.580
This would be photofission.

00:39:40.750 --> 00:39:42.010
This would be absorption.

00:39:44.948 --> 00:39:45.865
This would be leakage.

00:39:48.730 --> 00:39:51.820
How many neutrons get out
of our finite boundary?

00:39:51.820 --> 00:39:54.560
And if you remember
when we started out,

00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:58.450
we said we were going to make
the neutron balance equation

00:39:58.450 --> 00:40:00.355
equal to gains minus losses.

00:40:04.140 --> 00:40:06.630
And through our rainbow
explosion simplification,

00:40:06.630 --> 00:40:07.800
we've done exactly that.

00:40:10.490 --> 00:40:11.525
These are your gains.

00:40:15.138 --> 00:40:16.055
These are your losses.

00:40:18.770 --> 00:40:22.130
When gains minus
losses equals zero,

00:40:22.130 --> 00:40:23.670
the reactor's in
perfect balance.

00:40:23.670 --> 00:40:24.170
Yep?

00:40:24.170 --> 00:40:28.370
AUDIENCE: How does leakage
come out to be negative?

00:40:28.370 --> 00:40:30.620
MICHAEL SHORT: Leakage
comes out to be negative,

00:40:30.620 --> 00:40:32.400
despite the plus sign here.

00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:34.340
And that's actually intentional.

00:40:34.340 --> 00:40:36.740
That's because
neutrons traveled down

00:40:36.740 --> 00:40:38.700
the concentration gradient.

00:40:38.700 --> 00:40:41.360
So let's say we're going
to draw an imaginary flux

00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:43.460
spectrum that's going
to be quite correct.

00:40:43.460 --> 00:40:45.710
And I'm doing all of those
features for a reason.

00:40:45.710 --> 00:40:47.990
But let's look at the
concentration gradient

00:40:47.990 --> 00:40:50.000
right here.

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:59.280
Leakage is positive when your
flux gradient is negative.

00:41:02.300 --> 00:41:04.850
That's why the sign is
flipped right there.

00:41:04.850 --> 00:41:07.160
So a positive
diffusion term means

00:41:07.160 --> 00:41:11.300
you have neutrons leaking out
down a negative concentration

00:41:11.300 --> 00:41:15.710
gradient, because if you look at
the slope here, the change in x

00:41:15.710 --> 00:41:17.450
is positive.

00:41:17.450 --> 00:41:19.970
And the change in
flux is negative.

00:41:19.970 --> 00:41:21.590
So the slope is negative.

00:41:21.590 --> 00:41:23.450
Concentration
gradient is negative.

00:41:23.450 --> 00:41:25.070
That's why the sign
is the opposite

00:41:25.070 --> 00:41:26.698
of what you may expect.

00:41:26.698 --> 00:41:28.740
And the same thing goes
for chemical, or gaseous,

00:41:28.740 --> 00:41:30.122
or any other kind of diffusion.

00:41:30.122 --> 00:41:31.830
I'm glad you asked,
because that's always

00:41:31.830 --> 00:41:35.370
a point of confusion, is,
why is there that plus sign?

00:41:35.370 --> 00:41:37.330
That's intentional
And that's correct.

00:41:37.330 --> 00:41:37.830
Cool.

00:41:40.650 --> 00:41:41.370
Yeah, Shawn?

00:41:41.370 --> 00:41:42.910
AUDIENCE: So in
that case, if you

00:41:42.910 --> 00:41:44.550
were to explicitly
right out losses,

00:41:44.550 --> 00:41:48.512
would it be minus
absorption, plus leakage?

00:41:48.512 --> 00:41:50.220
MICHAEL SHORT: Let's
put some parentheses

00:41:50.220 --> 00:41:58.360
on here, equals
zero, and a minus.

00:41:58.360 --> 00:42:01.910
And when we say plus leakage,
we have that plus sign in there.

00:42:01.910 --> 00:42:03.910
So I'm not going to put
any parentheses up here,

00:42:03.910 --> 00:42:05.590
because that
wouldn't be correct.

00:42:05.590 --> 00:42:10.300
But what I can say is
that gains minus losses

00:42:10.300 --> 00:42:15.610
have to be in perfect balance to
have a k effective equal to 1.

00:42:15.610 --> 00:42:17.110
Does anyone else
have any questions,

00:42:17.110 --> 00:42:19.496
before I continue
the explanation?

00:42:19.496 --> 00:42:21.740
Cool.

00:42:21.740 --> 00:42:24.720
Let's say you're
producing more neutrons

00:42:24.720 --> 00:42:26.630
than you're destroying.

00:42:26.630 --> 00:42:28.310
That's what we
call supercritical.

00:42:32.120 --> 00:42:33.930
So I just did an
interview for this K

00:42:33.930 --> 00:42:36.450
through 12 outreach program.

00:42:36.450 --> 00:42:38.730
And they said, should
people be afraid

00:42:38.730 --> 00:42:42.090
when something, quote
unquote, goes critical?

00:42:42.090 --> 00:42:44.140
Sounds scary emotionally, right?

00:42:44.140 --> 00:42:45.550
And the answer is
absolutely not.

00:42:45.550 --> 00:42:47.370
If you're reactor goes
critical, it's turned on.

00:42:47.370 --> 00:42:48.537
And it's in perfect balance.

00:42:48.537 --> 00:42:50.010
That's exactly what you want.

00:42:50.010 --> 00:42:52.230
So going critical is
not a scary thing.

00:42:52.230 --> 00:42:53.850
It means we have control.

00:42:53.850 --> 00:42:56.790
If something goes supercritical,
it doesn't necessarily

00:42:56.790 --> 00:42:58.560
mean it's out of control.

00:42:58.560 --> 00:43:01.440
Reactors can be very
slightly supercritical

00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:03.120
and still in control,
because of what's

00:43:03.120 --> 00:43:05.880
called delayed neutrons, which
I will not introduce today,

00:43:05.880 --> 00:43:07.650
because we have two minutes.

00:43:07.650 --> 00:43:10.980
If a reactor has a k
effective of less than one,

00:43:10.980 --> 00:43:12.300
we call that subcritical.

00:43:15.730 --> 00:43:18.730
So it's important to note that
the nuclear terminology that's

00:43:18.730 --> 00:43:22.060
kind of leaked out
into our vernacular

00:43:22.060 --> 00:43:24.970
is not physically correct,
in the way that it's used.

00:43:24.970 --> 00:43:29.500
Words like critical are used
to incite emotions, and bring

00:43:29.500 --> 00:43:30.160
about fear.

00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:32.670
When to a nuclear
engineer critical means,

00:43:32.670 --> 00:43:35.590
in perfect control,
in balance, like

00:43:35.590 --> 00:43:37.100
you would expect,
or in equilibrium.

00:43:37.100 --> 00:43:38.860
That all sounds
kind of nice, makes

00:43:38.860 --> 00:43:40.660
you calm down a little bit.

00:43:40.660 --> 00:43:44.490
Yeah, so we can
put one last term

00:43:44.490 --> 00:43:48.670
in front of our
criticality condition.

00:43:48.670 --> 00:43:53.330
We can take either the gains or
the losses, move the equal sign

00:43:53.330 --> 00:44:00.750
and zero over a little bit, and
put a 1 over k effective here.

00:44:00.750 --> 00:44:05.070
This, then, perfectly
describes the difference

00:44:05.070 --> 00:44:08.610
between the gains and
the losses in a reactor.

00:44:08.610 --> 00:44:13.050
So if the gains equal the
losses, then k effective

00:44:13.050 --> 00:44:14.170
must equal 1.

00:44:14.170 --> 00:44:16.440
And the reactor has
got to be in balance.

00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:19.390
If there are more
gains than losses,

00:44:19.390 --> 00:44:21.930
which means if you are
producing more neutrons then

00:44:21.930 --> 00:44:24.570
you're consuming,
than k effective must

00:44:24.570 --> 00:44:30.600
be greater than 1 for this
equation to still equal zero,

00:44:30.600 --> 00:44:33.530
because this equation
must be satisfied.

00:44:33.530 --> 00:44:35.630
So if you're making
more neutrons,

00:44:35.630 --> 00:44:38.280
your k effective has got
to be greater than 1.

00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:41.360
So you have a less than
1 multiplier in front.

00:44:41.360 --> 00:44:45.380
And on the opposite side, if
you're losing more neutrons

00:44:45.380 --> 00:44:48.890
then you're gaining, your k
effective has to be less than 1

00:44:48.890 --> 00:44:51.680
to make this equation balanced.

00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:56.380
Going along with all these
definitions right here.

00:44:56.380 --> 00:44:58.870
So it's exactly 5 of 5 of.

00:44:58.870 --> 00:45:02.470
I've given you delivered
promised blackboard of Lucky

00:45:02.470 --> 00:45:03.760
Charms.

00:45:03.760 --> 00:45:06.400
And we've hit a
perfect spot, which

00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:10.060
is the one group homogeneous
steady state neutron diffusion

00:45:10.060 --> 00:45:12.250
equation, from
which we can develop

00:45:12.250 --> 00:45:15.220
our criticality conditions
and solve this much

00:45:15.220 --> 00:45:19.270
simpler equation to get
the flux profiles that I've

00:45:19.270 --> 00:45:20.812
started to draw here.

00:45:20.812 --> 00:45:23.020
So I want to stop here, and
take any questions on any

00:45:23.020 --> 00:45:24.450
of the terms you see here.

00:45:24.450 --> 00:45:24.950
Yeah?

00:45:24.950 --> 00:45:27.700
AUDIENCE: Didn't we talk a lot
about the different energies,

00:45:27.700 --> 00:45:31.320
like the one-group, two-group,
or the discrete distributed

00:45:31.320 --> 00:45:32.403
discretized energy groups?

00:45:32.403 --> 00:45:33.820
So when we're doing
the one group,

00:45:33.820 --> 00:45:35.890
you're actually just
treating them fast together?

00:45:35.890 --> 00:45:36.310
MICHAEL SHORT: We are.

00:45:36.310 --> 00:45:36.852
That's right.

00:45:36.852 --> 00:45:38.920
AUDIENCE: To know
that, like you said,

00:45:38.920 --> 00:45:41.925
the reactors do two group
in the actual analysis.

00:45:41.925 --> 00:45:44.050
MICHAEL SHORT: So a lot a
lot of reactors, at least

00:45:44.050 --> 00:45:46.660
thermal reactors where you only
care if neutrons are thermal

00:45:46.660 --> 00:45:48.820
or not, two group is enough.

00:45:48.820 --> 00:45:51.590
When you have a one group
or a two group equation,

00:45:51.590 --> 00:45:54.718
these are fairly
analytically solvable things.

00:45:54.718 --> 00:45:56.260
You get to any more
groups than that,

00:45:56.260 --> 00:45:57.940
and, yes, they're
analytically solvable.

00:45:57.940 --> 00:45:58.870
But it gets horrible.

00:45:58.870 --> 00:46:00.940
And that's why we
have computers to do

00:46:00.940 --> 00:46:03.190
the sorts of repetitive
calculations over and over

00:46:03.190 --> 00:46:04.210
again.

00:46:04.210 --> 00:46:06.800
Once we've solved the
one group equation,

00:46:06.800 --> 00:46:10.180
I'll then show you intuitive
ways to write, but not solve,

00:46:10.180 --> 00:46:15.280
the equations for
multi group equations.

00:46:15.280 --> 00:46:16.280
Sure.

00:46:16.280 --> 00:46:17.531
Any other questions?

00:46:21.932 --> 00:46:23.890
So like I promised, we
didn't stay complex for,

00:46:23.890 --> 00:46:25.740
long because there's
basically nothing left.

00:46:25.740 --> 00:46:26.440
Yeah?

00:46:26.440 --> 00:46:28.930
AUDIENCE: What is
the 2n over 2t?

00:46:28.930 --> 00:46:30.770
Are we saying that?

00:46:30.770 --> 00:46:33.430
MICHAEL SHORT: Oh, that's
a partial derivative.

00:46:33.430 --> 00:46:37.520
Yeah, there we go.

00:46:37.520 --> 00:46:42.630
So this is saying a change
in neutron population,

00:46:42.630 --> 00:46:45.480
or the partial derivative
of n with respect to t,

00:46:45.480 --> 00:46:48.210
because n varies with
space, energy, angle, time,

00:46:48.210 --> 00:46:52.070
and anything else you
could possibly think about,

00:46:52.070 --> 00:46:53.750
equals the gains
minus the losses.

00:46:58.590 --> 00:47:01.920
I think this is
worthy of a t-shirt.

00:47:01.920 --> 00:47:04.170
If any of you guys would
like to update the department

00:47:04.170 --> 00:47:07.110
shirts to properly take
into account photofission

00:47:07.110 --> 00:47:09.840
external sources
and nin reactions,

00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:13.860
I think it would make for a
much more impressive thing,

00:47:13.860 --> 00:47:18.840
because we kind of printed
an oversimplification before.

00:47:18.840 --> 00:47:19.680
It's too bad.

00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:21.180
We definitely had
room on the shirt.

00:47:21.180 --> 00:47:23.180
There was room on the
sides, and on the sleeves.

00:47:25.470 --> 00:47:26.687
Yeah, keep going.

00:47:26.687 --> 00:47:28.020
It might have to be long sleeve.

00:47:28.020 --> 00:47:29.478
I think that would
be pretty sweet.

00:47:32.950 --> 00:47:38.080
Yeah, OK, if no one else
has any immediate questions,

00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:39.780
you'll have plenty
of time tomorrow,

00:47:39.780 --> 00:47:41.447
because the whole
goal tomorrow is going

00:47:41.447 --> 00:47:42.760
to be to solve this equation.

00:47:42.760 --> 00:47:45.350
That's only going to
take like 20 minutes.

00:47:45.350 --> 00:47:48.310
So we can do a quick review
of the simplification

00:47:48.310 --> 00:47:50.140
of the neutron
transport equation,

00:47:50.140 --> 00:47:52.355
solve the neutron
diffusion equation.

00:47:52.355 --> 00:47:53.980
If you have questions,
we'll spend time

00:47:53.980 --> 00:47:55.210
to answer them there.

00:47:55.210 --> 00:47:57.910
And if you don't, we'll move
on to writing multi group

00:47:57.910 --> 00:47:59.200
equations.

00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:02.500
And also Friday for recitation,
it's electron microscope time.

00:48:02.500 --> 00:48:05.440
So now that you guys have
learned different electron

00:48:05.440 --> 00:48:07.962
interactions with matter,
you're going to see them.

00:48:07.962 --> 00:48:10.420
So we're going to be analyzing
a couple of different pieces

00:48:10.420 --> 00:48:13.717
of materials that a couple of
you are going to get to select.

00:48:13.717 --> 00:48:15.550
And we're going to image
them with electrons

00:48:15.550 --> 00:48:19.600
to show how you can beat the
wavelength of light imaging

00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:21.067
limit, like I told you before.

00:48:21.067 --> 00:48:22.900
We're going to produce
our own X-ray spectra

00:48:22.900 --> 00:48:24.650
to analyze them
elementally, where

00:48:24.650 --> 00:48:25.900
you'll see the bremsstrahlung.

00:48:25.900 --> 00:48:27.730
You'll see the
characteristic peaks.

00:48:27.730 --> 00:48:30.990
And you'll see a couple of other
features that I'll explain too.

00:48:30.990 --> 00:48:34.416
So get ready for
some SEM tomorrow.

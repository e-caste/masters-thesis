WEBVTT

00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.730
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.670
Let me also remind you that we
slightly changed the schedule

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:06.330
for next week.

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.925
On one of the older schedules,
Tuesday appears as a lab date,

00:00:11.925 --> 00:00:13.050
but it's actually Thursday.

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:15.540
So Tuesday will be a
regular lecture here

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.250
and Thursday will be the lab.

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.740
And for the lab,
we meet in 1115.

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.680
That's on the handout
for the first day.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.400
Also, if you're not
registered for class,

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.330
you don't have automatic
access to Stellar, the website.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.020
So we can manually add you,
but you'll have to let us know.

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.640
Just send an email to Professor
[? Marzari ?] and myself.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.280
And even better is if you
send an email to both of us.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.280
And then we'll
manually add that.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.170
And we'll put links there to
things like articles and things

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.880
that may have restricted access,
copies of the lecture notes,

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.520
things like that
will appear there.

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.180
OK.

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.530
So what I want to go do is go
back to their potential models.

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.190
And what we're
going to do today,

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.270
is talk a little more
in detail about the sort

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.960
of formal or conceptual failures
of pair potential models,

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.130
and then how to get addressed
with other empirical models.

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.210
But before I do
that, I wanted to--

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:26.493
let's see if I can get this
into place, guess not--

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:32.390
go through a few
practical issues,

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.000
since the first lab
is actually on using

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.580
pair potentials to model things
so you get a bit of an idea.

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:43.820
So in a potential model, your
energy is written pairwise.

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:45.500
And so essentially
what you need to do

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.510
between every pair of atoms--

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.547
every couple iJ--
essentially to evaluate

00:01:50.547 --> 00:01:52.130
the distance between
them and then put

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.270
that in some kind
of energy function.

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.240
So this is clearly an
N squared operation

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.040
where N is the number
of atoms, since you

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.170
have to look for the
distance between every atom

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:04.610
and every other atom.

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.472
So if systems get
extremely big--

00:02:07.472 --> 00:02:08.930
and that's often
the reason why you

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:11.180
want to use the pair
potentials rather than, say,

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:12.800
a quantum mechanical method--

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.870
N squared will get very large.

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.360
And people do kind of tricks.

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.730
If you have millions
and millions of atoms

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.690
in your simulation, if you know
ahead of time that some of them

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.560
are very far from the atom on
which J you want to calculate--

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:28.893
energies or forces--

00:02:28.893 --> 00:02:31.060
then you really never want
to look further distance.

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.280
So people do things like
keeping neighbor lists.

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.490
So literally, for every
atom you would know,

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:42.160
well, these other
items or possibly

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.310
in its neighbor environment.

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:46.810
So then you really
only have to look

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.550
for distances with those atoms.

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:51.190
So if you have a
solid, that's great.

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.400
Because if you have a solid,
then the topological relation

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.070
between atoms will not change
much during the simulation.

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:59.800
Of course, if you're simulating
a gas or a liquid, they will.

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.650
And then what you have to do is
essentially update the neighbor

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.810
lists regularly.

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.510
And so there's overhead
associated with that.

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.760
But the benefit you get
is that you essentially

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:16.300
have an order N system rather
than an N squared system.

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:21.310
I'll show you in a second
some large scale simulations.

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:25.190
Very often, you will
want to relax a system--

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:26.920
so get it to its lowest energy.

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.130
And very often, that's done by
calculating the forces on atoms

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:32.545
and literally stepping
down the force.

00:03:32.545 --> 00:03:34.670
If you want to do dynamics,
Professor [? Marzari ?]

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:36.400
will later teach you
molecular dynamics.

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.290
You also need the
force because the force

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.950
will tell you how much atoms
accelerate or decelerate.

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.080
You will need to
calculate the force, which

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:45.340
is a potential derivative.

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:46.870
So you're essentially
calculating

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:51.130
the derivative of the
total energy with respect

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:56.710
to a given position.

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:57.400
Same deal.

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.130
That's an N squared operation.

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:02.950
You have to sum
over pairs of atoms.

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.580
We have to sum over 1 all atoms
for the force on a given atom.

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:10.900
But since they're N atoms,
it's an N squared operation.

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.760
In a lot of codes,
the minimization

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.710
is done by very standard
schemes-- things

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:18.519
like conjugate gradient,
Newton-Raphson, sometimes often

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:21.820
trivial line minimizations where
you literally just calculate

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:25.990
the force and assume
some kind of elasticity

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:27.920
along the force path.

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:30.640
And so if you know
the force, you

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.260
assume you know what
the curvature is

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:33.593
of the energy in that direction.

00:04:33.593 --> 00:04:35.830
You kind of can make an
approximation to its minimum

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:39.520
when you do that iteratively.

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:47.560
So you can do that with
very large simulations.

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:51.100
And I wanted to show you sort
of one of the leading edge ones.

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:53.020
I got to get out of
PowerPoint for that

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:56.820
if I can make that work.

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:00.100
OK, here we go.

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:04.510
So what I'm going to show
you is a order million atom

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:05.100
simulation.

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:12.060
This is essentially a cube of
1,000 by 1,000 by 1,000 atoms.

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:15.840
That would make
more than a million.

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:19.750
I forgot to write
down what it was.

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:22.380
Yeah, I wrote down 1,000
by 1,000 by 1,000 atoms.

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:24.420
That would be a billion atoms.

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:26.130
And essentially
what's being done--

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:28.500
and what you see is a
notch on top and on bottom

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:31.590
because there's so many atoms
you don't see the discrete

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:34.048
resolution anymore [? of ?]
[? the ?] [? atoms, ?] [? so ?]

00:05:34.048 --> 00:05:37.380
this thing starts to
look like a continuum.

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:39.220
And it's being
pulled from the side.

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:42.870
So you'll see the cracked
grow and dislocation spread.

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:46.082
This is a simulation from Farid
Abraham when he was at IBM.

00:05:46.082 --> 00:05:47.790
And of course, if you
have big computers,

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:50.200
you can do big simulations.

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:51.870
So let me show it to you.

00:05:55.603 --> 00:05:57.020
So what they
actually did was they

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:59.210
showed just the
dislocations by counting

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:02.240
under-coordinated or
over-coordinated atoms.

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:05.450
So what you're actually seeing
is the dislocation lines.

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:07.400
I mean, if we plotted
all the atoms,

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:08.750
you wouldn't see anything.

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:10.610
You'd just kind of
see green everywhere.

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:13.970
And that's sort of zoom up.

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:15.840
So this is a molecular
dynamic simulation.

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:18.257
And you learn later more about
that, where you essentially

00:06:18.257 --> 00:06:22.490
just do Newtonian
mechanics on atoms.

00:06:26.252 --> 00:06:28.210
So this is one of these
very large scale things

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:33.980
that you can actually
do with potentials.

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:43.747
Now, you could ask yourself,
what did I learn from this?

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:49.580
This is the kind of work
that my personal opinion

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:52.070
is scientifically not
necessarily all that relevant.

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:54.200
But it's pioneering
work, you know.

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:56.900
This is like Lewis and
Clark who went to the West.

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:59.720
You could always say, what
did we learn from them?

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:02.780
Maybe not a lot, except that
you could get the Pacific.

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:04.250
But it's kind of
pioneering work.

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:06.397
And when people do these
kind of simulations,

00:07:06.397 --> 00:07:08.480
it's not as much for the
science as it is probably

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:10.160
for pushing the
envelope and seeing

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:13.760
what can you do with enormous
computational resources.

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:16.820
You really have to fine
tune your algorithms,

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:18.400
your parallelization scheme.

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:21.922
So it's kind of like
flying to the moon which

00:07:21.922 --> 00:07:23.130
may have not brought us much.

00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:25.920
But there was a lot of
technology fine tuned for that.

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:28.820
So that's one of the
reasons I wanted to show it.

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:34.460
OK, let's go back.

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:39.980
Another very practical issue
that I'm sure a lot of you

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:42.680
are familiar with.

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:44.660
Even when you have
a billion atoms,

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:46.320
it's actually still very small.

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:49.710
I actually think if you do the
calculation, a million atoms

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:53.030
is, for a lot of materials,
a cube of just about 200

00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:56.120
Angstrom on the side
so you're still,

00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:59.840
if these were finite systems,
would be very small systems.

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:01.310
So to get rid of
boundary effects,

00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:03.518
you almost always use what's
called periodic boundary

00:08:03.518 --> 00:08:07.550
conditions in simulations in
as many directions as you can.

00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:09.950
And of course, what a
periodic boundary condition

00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:16.290
means is that if you have some
unit, if you have some unit,

00:08:16.290 --> 00:08:18.080
you essentially
repeat it next to it.

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:21.250
So this end here is
the same as that end,

00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:24.120
and this end here is
the same as that end.

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:26.220
So people always
ask you how many

00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:28.140
atoms do you have
in your simulation,

00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:30.810
and the answer is infinite.

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:33.960
It's just that you only have
a finite number of degrees

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:38.669
of freedom because it's
these atoms here do

00:08:38.669 --> 00:08:41.460
exactly the same as these here.

00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:43.299
But the answer is infinite.

00:08:43.299 --> 00:08:45.690
So we don't really work
with small systems.

00:08:45.690 --> 00:08:46.530
Or, rarely.

00:08:46.530 --> 00:08:50.260
I mean, sometimes we
work with finite systems.

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.470
So what's the
repeat unit you use?

00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:54.990
Well, if you're studying
a periodic material,

00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:56.177
then it's easy.

00:08:56.177 --> 00:08:58.260
If you study, say, a perfect
crystalline material,

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:01.710
here's a perovskite unit,
so that's what you repeat.

00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:05.165
Because the material already
has periodicity implied in it.

00:09:05.165 --> 00:09:06.540
So at that point,
you're actually

00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:09.240
not making any approximation.

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:11.820
You're not forcing
anything on the material--

00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:14.850
not when you do a static
calculation that it already

00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:16.165
doesn't have.

00:09:16.165 --> 00:09:17.790
Of course, when you
do dynamics, you're

00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:19.207
enforcing something
because you're

00:09:19.207 --> 00:09:24.330
saying that in dynamics, the
translational symmetry is

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:27.810
temporarily broken because this
atom can vibrate independent

00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:29.190
of that one.

00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:32.370
And so, then, when you
improve impulse periodicity,

00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:35.440
you are imposing that
these vibrate together.

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:38.430
So in some sense,
you're imposing a cutoff

00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:40.560
on the frequencies of
vibrations that can occur.

00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:46.490
If systems don't
have periodicity,

00:09:46.490 --> 00:09:48.410
you typically tend
to enforce it.

00:09:48.410 --> 00:09:52.250
If I took this perovskite
and I made one defect--

00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:55.070
say I wanted to study
oxygen vacancy so I take out

00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:59.570
the oxygen vacancy, I lose all
translational periodicity now.

00:09:59.570 --> 00:10:02.420
But what you do is you
tend to impose it back

00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:03.560
by repeating the defect.

00:10:08.410 --> 00:10:10.610
It's going to be slow.

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:16.150
So let's say I've taken
out an oxygen here.

00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:19.600
I repeat the defect
so that, in essence,

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:21.130
I just have a bigger unit cell.

00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:22.810
But it's one with
a defect in it.

00:10:22.810 --> 00:10:25.000
This is now my unit cell.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.910
And that's called a
supercell approximation.

00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:32.410
So you make a cell that's
big enough so that you

00:10:32.410 --> 00:10:34.700
hope that these defects--

00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:35.950
I don't know how you call it--

00:10:35.950 --> 00:10:42.190
don't interact because
then, if you have N cells,

00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:45.910
your calculation just has
the energy of N defects.

00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:46.480
OK?

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:48.490
And the critical
assumption is, of course,

00:10:48.490 --> 00:10:49.918
that they don't interact.

00:10:49.918 --> 00:10:51.460
Because if they
interact, then you're

00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:53.020
not modeling an isolated defect.

00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:56.900
You're modeling a defect that's
interacting with other ones.

00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:59.920
So how do they
interact typically?

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:01.315
It's kind of important to know.

00:11:01.315 --> 00:11:03.940
This is one of these things that
you're going to do in the lab.

00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:06.600
You should always check
conversions if you can.

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:08.350
The problem is that
often you already work

00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:10.900
at your computational limits
for size of supercells,

00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:13.072
so it's easier said than done.

00:11:13.072 --> 00:11:14.530
In an ideal world,
you say, well, I

00:11:14.530 --> 00:11:18.400
calculate bigger and bigger, and
if the answer doesn't change,

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:19.270
I take it.

00:11:19.270 --> 00:11:22.095
But usually, you work so much
at your computational edge

00:11:22.095 --> 00:11:24.220
already that you can't make
them bigger and bigger.

00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:26.220
A lot of people forget
that [? to ?] [? check ?]

00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:28.720
[? conversions, ?] you
also can make it smaller.

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:30.160
And if it doesn't
change much, you

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:32.740
were probably already converged.

00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:36.190
But it's useful to know
how these things usually

00:11:36.190 --> 00:11:37.340
interact with each other.

00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:40.780
So that gives you some sense
of how far you have to go.

00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:43.300
There's often the direct
sort of interaction.

00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:44.890
If you work with
a pair potential,

00:11:44.890 --> 00:11:48.320
then you can actually see the
range of the pair potential.

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:50.170
That's usually not the problem.

00:11:50.170 --> 00:11:53.200
Rarely do you have potentials
that are relevant, large,

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:55.720
and over large distances
that you need to make

00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:57.700
really large supercells.

00:11:57.700 --> 00:11:59.755
But there can be other
energetic effects.

00:11:59.755 --> 00:12:02.432
If you have electrostatics
in your system,

00:12:02.432 --> 00:12:04.390
that will give you very
long range interaction.

00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:05.860
If that's a charge defect--

00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:08.350
which it is in a perovskite--

00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:10.150
you will have a very strong one.

00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:14.200
Actually, if we truly
did a charge defect

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:15.910
in that supercell,
what would happen?

00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:23.240
If that supercell
became charged--

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:25.070
so let's say I
took out an oxygen

00:12:25.070 --> 00:12:27.350
2 minus, which means
the supercell now

00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:29.180
has a net positive charge--

00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:34.140
what would happen?

00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:37.790
You'd have an infinite energy
because you would essentially

00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:43.460
have a positive charge
interacting with only other net

00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:45.260
positive charges.

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:47.840
And at any distance, if
you do an infinite system,

00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:50.763
that gives you an
infinite energy.

00:12:50.763 --> 00:12:52.180
So that's something
that you would

00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:54.450
have to explicitly take out.

00:12:54.450 --> 00:12:58.150
Now you say, well,
I'll compensate

00:12:58.150 --> 00:13:03.290
with a negative charge because
that's what happens in reality.

00:13:03.290 --> 00:13:05.683
If I take out an oxygen,
those two electrons

00:13:05.683 --> 00:13:07.600
of that or O2 minus are
going to go somewhere,

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:10.040
so it's going to create
a net positive charge.

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:12.990
So then you have a dipole.

00:13:12.990 --> 00:13:15.750
So let's say I have
sort of plus, minus,

00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:18.060
and I have a dipole now.

00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:20.160
So now I have
dipoles interacting.

00:13:24.690 --> 00:13:26.880
Dipoles will not give
you infinite energy,

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:31.120
but they will give you a
fairly long range energy tail.

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:33.160
And if you're smart about it--

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:36.360
so the brute force way to
convert supercell calculation

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:39.840
is always to push him as
hard as you can and hope

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:42.545
and sort of see the energy
converge of the defect.

00:13:42.545 --> 00:13:43.920
But if you're
smart about it, you

00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:46.050
can often do much
smaller cell calculations

00:13:46.050 --> 00:13:48.900
and explicitly take
out the term that's

00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:51.990
the defect-defect interaction.

00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:54.720
Which is, if you know
that this is a dipole,

00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:59.340
you know what the form is of
it, and you can take it out.

00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:02.940
Other things that often
cause havoc is relaxation.

00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:05.460
If I were to put
a really big ion

00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:08.580
in the center of that
perovskite unit cell,

00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:12.030
I would build up a strain
field and the different defects

00:14:12.030 --> 00:14:15.060
would interact through
their strain field.

00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:16.980
So, rarely do you
actually interact

00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:19.180
through the direct energetics.

00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:23.460
You often interact
through secondary effects.

00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:27.960
Another way they often interact
which is very indirect.

00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:29.970
If you put in your
defect and you

00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:36.140
relax the volume
of the supercell,

00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:38.720
then that will interfere
with the relaxation

00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:41.340
of the supercell next to it.

00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:44.570
So you get a strain field
just through the homogeneous.

00:14:44.570 --> 00:14:46.430
You get an extra
energy term just

00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:48.393
through the homogeneous
strain interaction.

00:14:48.393 --> 00:14:50.060
So these are all
things to consider when

00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:52.720
you do supercell calculations.

00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:59.030
We're trying something new
where we save the annotations

00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:02.270
we make on the slides, but
it seems to be really slow.

00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:06.770
So I may not be able
to keep that up.

00:15:06.770 --> 00:15:11.720
OK, so this I went over--
the kind of convergence.

00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:14.540
You know, here's
a typical example.

00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:16.400
I don't know if this is typical.

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:18.592
This is the vacancy
formation energy in aluminum.

00:15:18.592 --> 00:15:20.300
Now, this is done with
quantum mechanics,

00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:22.730
versus the number of
atoms in the supercell.

00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:26.450
And you know, this
is one of these

00:15:26.450 --> 00:15:30.402
that you really don't
know if you're converged.

00:15:30.402 --> 00:15:32.360
I mean, it depends on
how accurate you want it.

00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:36.710
If you really only care that
it's between 0.7 and 0.75,

00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:38.100
you're probably OK.

00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:40.410
But if you did this
point and that point,

00:15:40.410 --> 00:15:42.387
you'd probably think
you're converged.

00:15:42.387 --> 00:15:43.970
But then, if you
look at the next one,

00:15:43.970 --> 00:15:46.012
you're actually going back
up a little bit again.

00:15:46.012 --> 00:15:48.980
So it's sometimes very hard
to figure out whether you're

00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:50.314
actually converged.

00:15:54.030 --> 00:15:55.955
OK.

00:15:55.955 --> 00:15:58.080
So that was a few practical
issues to sort of start

00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:00.163
gearing you up for the lab.

00:16:00.163 --> 00:16:01.830
What I want to do now
is talk explicitly

00:16:01.830 --> 00:16:04.620
about some of the formal
failures of pair potentials

00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:06.250
and go on to correct them.

00:16:06.250 --> 00:16:08.490
And the first one is the
vacancy formation energy

00:16:08.490 --> 00:16:13.500
which is, if you look at
historically when people

00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:19.470
started doing simulations late
1950s, 1960s, into the '70s,

00:16:19.470 --> 00:16:22.170
people thought that
whenever there was something

00:16:22.170 --> 00:16:24.720
wrong with the outcome that
they just needed better

00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:27.810
parameters in the potential.

00:16:27.810 --> 00:16:31.992
And it's actually rather
recent-- sort of 1980s--

00:16:31.992 --> 00:16:34.200
that people figured out that
there were really formal

00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:37.110
problems and that there were
certain things you could not

00:16:37.110 --> 00:16:38.760
get right-- never--

00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:41.130
with a potential because
the problem of the form

00:16:41.130 --> 00:16:42.780
rather than of the parameters.

00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:45.630
And a critical
number in that work

00:16:45.630 --> 00:16:47.940
was actually the vacancy
formation energy which

00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:49.530
nobody could ever get right.

00:16:49.530 --> 00:16:50.940
And I'll show in a second why.

00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:55.110
Here's an FCC crystal.

00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:59.280
So let's calculate the pair
approximation to the vacancy

00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:01.080
formation energy.

00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:03.720
What do I do when
I make a vacancy?

00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:08.579
What I do is that I
take this central atom

00:17:08.579 --> 00:17:12.339
and I move it somewhere
else in the bulk.

00:17:12.339 --> 00:17:16.020
So in some sense, I make
my system one side bigger.

00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:19.300
So let's calculate the
energy balance of that.

00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:21.390
So the vacancy formation energy.

00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:25.020
OK.

00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:26.339
What do I destroy?

00:17:26.339 --> 00:17:31.440
I destroy 12 bonds because this
atom is coordinated 12-fold

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:32.790
in FCC.

00:17:32.790 --> 00:17:34.140
So I destroy 12 bonds.

00:17:36.790 --> 00:17:41.310
I lose 12 times the bond energy.

00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:44.270
But then, of course, I put it
back somewhere in the bulk.

00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:49.660
And so I gained the
cohesive energy of one atom.

00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:50.590
OK?

00:17:50.590 --> 00:17:54.130
And what's the cohesive
energy per atom in FCC?

00:17:54.130 --> 00:17:57.310
It's 6 times the bond
energy because there

00:17:57.310 --> 00:17:59.740
are 12 bonds around an
atom, but every bond

00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:01.430
is shared between two.

00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:01.930
OK?

00:18:01.930 --> 00:18:04.240
So there's six per atom.

00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:07.870
So the vacancy formation
is really minus 12 times

00:18:07.870 --> 00:18:10.960
the bond energy plus 6
times the bond energy.

00:18:13.990 --> 00:18:19.890
So what it is is minus 6
times the bond the energy.

00:18:19.890 --> 00:18:25.260
So essentially, it's
minus the cohesive energy.

00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:29.120
The cohesive energy per atom.

00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:31.100
And that's essentially
what you will always

00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:33.270
find repair potentials.

00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:35.690
Now, I did a static
approximation.

00:18:35.690 --> 00:18:37.100
I assumed that
all of these bonds

00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:39.770
were kind of unchanged
as I took the atom out.

00:18:39.770 --> 00:18:42.500
In reality, if I take
that central atom out,

00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:44.570
the atoms around it
will relax somewhat

00:18:44.570 --> 00:18:46.760
and change their bond energy.

00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:49.190
But you'll see this when
you do this in the lab.

00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:52.550
That will make it from one
time the cohesive energy

00:18:52.550 --> 00:18:56.330
to something like 0.9 or 0.95
times the cohesive energy.

00:18:56.330 --> 00:18:58.340
Essentially, you find
in pair potentials

00:18:58.340 --> 00:19:00.350
that the vacancy
formation energy

00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:03.090
is about the cohesive energy.

00:19:03.090 --> 00:19:06.450
If you look, on the other
hand, at experimental results

00:19:06.450 --> 00:19:07.550
for the cohesive energy--

00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:17.130
[INAUDIBLE]---- here's
some experimental data.

00:19:17.130 --> 00:19:20.240
So this is for FCC metals,
and this is for Leonard-Jones,

00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:21.230
and for noble gases.

00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:24.590
The ratio of the
vacancy formation energy

00:19:24.590 --> 00:19:27.170
to the cohesive energy.

00:19:27.170 --> 00:19:31.590
And what you see is that,
in the noble gases--

00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:33.710
which you think of as
well-described by pair

00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:35.000
potentials--

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.550
you're reasonably close.

00:19:37.550 --> 00:19:39.410
Because remember,
noble gases are just

00:19:39.410 --> 00:19:42.230
inert shells interacting through
Van der Waals interaction,

00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:45.470
and that's how we came up with
the Leonard-Jones potential.

00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:49.760
But if you look at the metals,
the vacancy formation energy

00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:52.220
is actually only
a small fraction

00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:55.370
of the cohesive energy.

00:19:55.370 --> 00:19:58.220
And we can never get that
low with pair potentials.

00:19:58.220 --> 00:19:59.330
Never.

00:19:59.330 --> 00:19:59.900
OK?

00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:04.100
Unless you maybe really
have the most odd form

00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:06.530
of a pair potential.

00:20:06.530 --> 00:20:09.470
But the reason is because there
are certain physics missing

00:20:09.470 --> 00:20:11.052
from pair potentials.

00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:28.220
So actually, let me go back
for a second to the pair

00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:30.380
potentials.

00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:34.850
What's the physics here of why
the vacancy formation energy is

00:20:34.850 --> 00:20:39.440
so low in real materials?

00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:43.070
Remember what I said
before, that bonding

00:20:43.070 --> 00:20:47.330
in metals, the bonding
energy goes not linear

00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:49.100
in the coordination number.

00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:51.560
It's more something like
a rough approximation

00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:54.980
would be the square root
of the coordination number.

00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:59.020
But essentially, when
you go from 1 to 2 bonds,

00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:00.770
your energy goes down
a lot more than when

00:21:00.770 --> 00:21:04.250
you go from 11 to 12 bonds.

00:21:04.250 --> 00:21:07.850
So why is the vacancy
formation energy so low?

00:21:07.850 --> 00:21:10.100
Well, if you think about
what you do when you take out

00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:14.990
an atom, you make a lot
of the atoms around it

00:21:14.990 --> 00:21:19.260
go from 12 coordination to 11.

00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:27.498
So they lose a lot less than
1/12 of the cohesive energy

00:21:27.498 --> 00:21:29.290
because the cohesive
energy you could think

00:21:29.290 --> 00:21:32.830
of as the average of all bonds.

00:21:32.830 --> 00:21:36.430
But around the vacancy, you are
just reducing the coordination

00:21:36.430 --> 00:21:37.840
from 12 to 11.

00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:41.230
You can actually
make a simple model

00:21:41.230 --> 00:21:47.680
if you said that the
cohesive energy was

00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:54.800
some constant times the square
root of the coordination.

00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:57.020
So rather than linear in
the coordination, which

00:21:57.020 --> 00:22:01.370
is what we would get in pair
of potentials, if you calculate

00:22:01.370 --> 00:22:03.800
the vacancy formation
energy in this model--

00:22:08.970 --> 00:22:10.410
let's do it for FCC.

00:22:10.410 --> 00:22:11.820
In FCC, Z is 12.

00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:20.840
The vacancy formation
energy, what would it be?

00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:25.480
Well, if we put the
atom somewhere back in,

00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:31.070
we would gain Z times
the square root of 12.

00:22:31.070 --> 00:22:34.820
And then, as we take it
out, what do we lose?

00:22:34.820 --> 00:22:41.540
For 12 atoms, we go from
coordination 12 to 11.

00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:46.250
So this is the atom in the bulk.

00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:53.010
This is actually the change
around where we made the hole.

00:22:58.430 --> 00:23:01.900
And if you actually
calculate that--

00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:04.690
the vacancy formation energy
over the cohesive energy--

00:23:09.380 --> 00:23:15.530
you find that that's 1 plus
12 times square root of 11

00:23:15.530 --> 00:23:18.590
over square root of 12 minus 1.

00:23:18.590 --> 00:23:21.680
And it's about 0.49.

00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:23.330
So in a square
root model, you're

00:23:23.330 --> 00:23:25.970
already much closer
to the experiment

00:23:25.970 --> 00:23:29.540
where the vacancy
formation energy

00:23:29.540 --> 00:23:32.660
is a much smaller fraction
of the cohesive energy.

00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:44.890
Another critical
piece of information

00:23:44.890 --> 00:23:47.890
was surface relaxation,
which people

00:23:47.890 --> 00:23:52.270
had been seeing with
[? LEEDs. ?] If you look

00:23:52.270 --> 00:23:55.960
at a metal, typically
if you create a surface,

00:23:55.960 --> 00:23:59.830
the difference between the
first and the second layer

00:23:59.830 --> 00:24:01.790
becomes smaller.

00:24:01.790 --> 00:24:05.360
So in a metal, the first
layer tends to relax inward.

00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:11.973
And can somebody explain
to me why that happens?

00:24:11.973 --> 00:24:13.390
And typically, you
don't see this.

00:24:13.390 --> 00:24:16.330
In pair potentials,
you very often

00:24:16.330 --> 00:24:18.200
have about the same distance.

00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:20.530
So the first to second
neighbor distance

00:24:20.530 --> 00:24:25.090
is often bulk-like and in some
cases actually relaxes outwards

00:24:25.090 --> 00:24:27.010
because of competing forces.

00:24:27.010 --> 00:24:32.820
But in almost all real systems,
it tends to relax inward.

00:24:32.820 --> 00:24:35.360
Why do you think that is?

00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:36.500
Yes, [INAUDIBLE]?

00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:39.106
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:44.893 --> 00:24:45.560
PROFESSOR: True.

00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:49.180
But I'm not sure
that that necessarily

00:24:49.180 --> 00:24:52.570
makes it relax inward.

00:24:52.570 --> 00:24:54.820
The reason it relaxes
inward is because the bonds

00:24:54.820 --> 00:24:57.228
between the first and the
second layer strengthen.

00:24:57.228 --> 00:24:58.770
That's really what
is a sign of them.

00:24:58.770 --> 00:25:00.960
And why do they strengthen?

00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:03.630
Because the surface
is under-coordinated.

00:25:03.630 --> 00:25:06.090
Remember, if you go
to lower coordination,

00:25:06.090 --> 00:25:07.560
you're effectively--

00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:09.270
although you're losing
energy and that's

00:25:09.270 --> 00:25:10.740
why there's surface energy--

00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:15.300
but the energy per bond is
actually becoming stronger.

00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:17.850
Remember that I showed you
the potentials for copper?

00:25:17.850 --> 00:25:25.090
Remember that for the
copper II molecule--

00:25:25.090 --> 00:25:29.410
so where you just had one bond--
had the strongest potential.

00:25:29.410 --> 00:25:31.170
The equation of
state gave you where

00:25:31.170 --> 00:25:34.270
your were 12-fold coordinate
gave you much weaker potential.

00:25:34.270 --> 00:25:37.080
So you see that in
surfaces as well.

00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:41.700
If you cut away the bonds here,
the remaining ones strengthen

00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:43.110
and they pull the layer in.

00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:51.890
The other problem that's
common in pair potential

00:25:51.890 --> 00:25:53.473
which I won't say
much about is what's

00:25:53.473 --> 00:25:55.040
called the Cauchy problem.

00:25:55.040 --> 00:26:01.430
If you write down the
relation between the stress

00:26:01.430 --> 00:26:03.950
and the strain
tensor and so this

00:26:03.950 --> 00:26:05.810
is the matrix of
elastic constant that

00:26:05.810 --> 00:26:11.130
for pair potential C12 and
C44 are always the same.

00:26:11.130 --> 00:26:13.400
And this has something to
do with there actually being

00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:15.170
a zero-energy strain mold.

00:26:15.170 --> 00:26:16.880
Remember that I showed you this?

00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:19.460
It's related to the same
issue that in a cubic

00:26:19.460 --> 00:26:23.330
or in a square model, you
can actually kind of slide it

00:26:23.330 --> 00:26:25.370
without any energy change.

00:26:25.370 --> 00:26:27.410
And that actually
puts a constraint

00:26:27.410 --> 00:26:29.450
on the elastic constant,
which essentially

00:26:29.450 --> 00:26:33.110
translates to C12 being C44.

00:26:36.230 --> 00:26:38.930
And the last one--

00:26:38.930 --> 00:26:40.880
if you're a practicing
material scientist--

00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:43.730
may be one of the
important ones.

00:26:43.730 --> 00:26:47.270
But you can essentially not
predict crystal structure

00:26:47.270 --> 00:26:50.900
in anything that's covalent.

00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:52.880
And metals are covalent.

00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:55.160
I know they teach you there's
metallic, covalent, then

00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:56.030
ionic bonding.

00:26:56.030 --> 00:27:00.450
But metallic is just
delocalized covalent.

00:27:00.450 --> 00:27:02.188
And the reason is--

00:27:02.188 --> 00:27:03.980
I think you can already
see-- first of all,

00:27:03.980 --> 00:27:07.160
potentials tend to go
to close packing always

00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:10.880
because they just they want to
have as many atoms around them

00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:12.680
as possible because
that's how you

00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:14.240
bring the cohesive energy down.

00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:17.540
And they don't count that
cost, that if you bring more

00:27:17.540 --> 00:27:21.290
around you, your bound
strength weakens.

00:27:21.290 --> 00:27:23.550
And they have no
directional dependence,

00:27:23.550 --> 00:27:27.860
so they miss those two
important components

00:27:27.860 --> 00:27:29.378
to get crystal structure right.

00:27:29.378 --> 00:27:31.170
You can actually do
some theory about this,

00:27:31.170 --> 00:27:32.720
which was done
already in the '70s

00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:36.020
that you actually
need what's called

00:27:36.020 --> 00:27:39.620
at least the fourth moment
of the density of states

00:27:39.620 --> 00:27:41.030
to get crystal structure right.

00:27:41.030 --> 00:27:44.100
And that turns out to be at
least a four-body effect.

00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:47.970
So if you actually thought of
potentials as an expansion--

00:27:47.970 --> 00:27:52.020
so I'm going to write the energy
as a constant plus an expansion

00:27:52.020 --> 00:27:54.570
in two-body terms, three-body
terms, four-body terms, et

00:27:54.570 --> 00:27:56.900
cetera, which we don't
even know would converge--

00:27:56.900 --> 00:27:59.840
you would have to go at
least up to the fourth order

00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:02.360
to get crystal structure
differences right.

00:28:06.180 --> 00:28:09.270
OK, so how do you
fix the problem?

00:28:09.270 --> 00:28:11.610
There are essentially,
if you look

00:28:11.610 --> 00:28:18.630
at the literature of empirical
models, two avenues to go.

00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:23.850
You can either make what's
called cluster potentials.

00:28:23.850 --> 00:28:26.760
And so, if you don't like
a two-body potential,

00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:28.482
you can make a
three-body potential.

00:28:28.482 --> 00:28:29.940
And the advantage
of that, once you

00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:35.850
have a three-body potential,
you can see angular dependence.

00:28:35.850 --> 00:28:41.490
Because if I have three
atoms and they don't interact

00:28:41.490 --> 00:28:44.400
just pairwise, but there's
a [? two ?] three-body,

00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:48.330
I can include this
bonding angle.

00:28:48.330 --> 00:28:52.560
A bonding angle is truly
a three-body concept.

00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:56.040
So you can start building
an angular dependence.

00:28:56.040 --> 00:29:01.590
The other direction to go
is go to pair functionals.

00:29:01.590 --> 00:29:05.160
So you still want to write
the [? energies ?] pairwise--

00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:06.970
some pairwise summation.

00:29:06.970 --> 00:29:09.100
You just don't want the
cohesive energy per atom

00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:12.510
to go linear with
what you sum pairwise

00:29:12.510 --> 00:29:16.980
or what you sum as its
environment pairwise.

00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:19.020
So we're going to deal
with both in class.

00:29:19.020 --> 00:29:22.236
Today, I'm going to mainly
do pair functionals.

00:29:22.236 --> 00:29:27.240
Pair functionals tends to be
most applicable to metals.

00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:29.790
Where I would say the
square root depends,

00:29:29.790 --> 00:29:33.570
that effect is strongest,
whereas cluster potentials

00:29:33.570 --> 00:29:35.490
or many body
potentials in general

00:29:35.490 --> 00:29:39.270
tend to be more favored in
the organic literature--

00:29:39.270 --> 00:29:42.510
both organic chemistry
and polymer chemistry.

00:29:42.510 --> 00:29:44.970
And so, going to that.

00:29:54.060 --> 00:29:56.730
So there's a whole
class of methods

00:29:56.730 --> 00:29:59.108
which are called
effective medium theories.

00:29:59.108 --> 00:30:00.900
The version of it that
I'm going to discuss

00:30:00.900 --> 00:30:03.400
is what's called the embedded
atom method, which is probably

00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:06.510
the most popular one.

00:30:06.510 --> 00:30:09.150
This was developed by [? Mike ?]
[? Baskis ?] [? and ?]

00:30:09.150 --> 00:30:14.460
[? Murray ?] [? Dahl ?] I
think going back to the '80s.

00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:16.630
Mid '80s, or
something like that.

00:30:16.630 --> 00:30:19.500
And it's probably
now the most popular

00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:21.780
of the sort of empirical
energy schemes.

00:30:21.780 --> 00:30:23.340
If you look back
at those papers,

00:30:23.340 --> 00:30:27.090
those papers have now
over 1,000 citations.

00:30:27.090 --> 00:30:29.265
And the idea is
extremely simple.

00:30:29.265 --> 00:30:31.590
It's, if you understand
the source of the problem--

00:30:31.590 --> 00:30:33.120
that our energy
should not be linear

00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:35.483
with coordination-- that's
what you're going to fix.

00:30:35.483 --> 00:30:36.900
So in these models,
what you do is

00:30:36.900 --> 00:30:41.460
you write the energy per atom
as a function of the number

00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:43.200
of bonds around it.

00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:46.650
It's just that F
should not be linear.

00:30:46.650 --> 00:30:50.850
And so that's why they call it
energy functionals rather than

00:30:50.850 --> 00:30:52.650
a pair potential.

00:30:52.650 --> 00:30:56.832
The question is, how do you
measure number of bonds?

00:30:56.832 --> 00:30:59.040
And if you sort think about
it, if you think yourself

00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:01.635
back in the '80s,
how do you want

00:31:01.635 --> 00:31:03.570
to measure number of bonds?

00:31:03.570 --> 00:31:06.900
You don't really want
to do it discreetly.

00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:08.970
Because you could
say, well, maybe I'm

00:31:08.970 --> 00:31:12.780
just going to count atoms
within a two-Angstrom radius,

00:31:12.780 --> 00:31:14.100
or some radius.

00:31:14.100 --> 00:31:16.590
The problem is, as soon as
you measure it discretely,

00:31:16.590 --> 00:31:19.620
you're going to have to
deal with discontinuities.

00:31:19.620 --> 00:31:21.630
As atoms move in and
out of that radius,

00:31:21.630 --> 00:31:26.070
suddenly you've got 14 things
around you instead of 15.

00:31:26.070 --> 00:31:29.310
So you would always
have super large forces

00:31:29.310 --> 00:31:32.100
because of those discontinuities
around your [? cutoff ?]

00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:32.800
interface.

00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:37.860
So what you need is a smooth
count of coordination.

00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:42.150
And the one they came up with
in the embedded atom method

00:31:42.150 --> 00:31:44.670
is literally, you
measure the electron

00:31:44.670 --> 00:31:49.110
density being projected on
you from your neighbors.

00:31:49.110 --> 00:31:50.070
It's ironic.

00:31:50.070 --> 00:31:52.590
I'll show you later the
formal justification

00:31:52.590 --> 00:31:55.050
for the embedded atom
method which has a lot more

00:31:55.050 --> 00:31:57.210
to do with quantum mechanics.

00:31:57.210 --> 00:32:01.000
But that was actually a
justification after the fact.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.080
The original idea
came up with sort of,

00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:06.450
you really want to have a
continuous measure of bumbling

00:32:06.450 --> 00:32:07.420
around you.

00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:11.280
And so the idea is that you're
going to do something like,

00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:13.530
I have a central atom.

00:32:13.530 --> 00:32:17.250
I have other atoms around me.

00:32:17.250 --> 00:32:20.520
How do I measure how much these
contribute to my neighborhood?

00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:24.840
Well, these have some electron
density functions around them.

00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:30.770
Their atomic electron
density I'm sort of drawing.

00:32:30.770 --> 00:32:33.320
And they all project
onto that central atom.

00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:36.650
You count up how much
electron density there

00:32:36.650 --> 00:32:40.162
and that's somehow a measurement
of your neighborhood.

00:32:40.162 --> 00:32:41.870
And you see, that's
going to roughly have

00:32:41.870 --> 00:32:42.662
the right behavior.

00:32:42.662 --> 00:32:43.760
It's continuous.

00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:47.270
As atoms move farther away,
they still contribute,

00:32:47.270 --> 00:32:48.650
but they contribute less.

00:32:48.650 --> 00:32:50.090
So it is a continuous measure.

00:32:50.090 --> 00:32:53.780
And the more
density you project,

00:32:53.780 --> 00:32:57.840
either the closer by the
atoms are or the more of them

00:32:57.840 --> 00:32:58.340
there are.

00:33:04.610 --> 00:33:05.960
OK.

00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:07.820
So this is the idea of
the electron density.

00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:10.430
You're going to actually
calculate the electron density

00:33:10.430 --> 00:33:14.060
on a site as a measurement in
some sense of the coordination

00:33:14.060 --> 00:33:18.080
as a sum of electron densities
coming from its neighboring

00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:19.890
atoms, J. OK?

00:33:23.230 --> 00:33:28.600
What electron densities you
use is kind of less relevant.

00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:31.330
In the original embedded atom
and in most embedded atom codes

00:33:31.330 --> 00:33:34.930
still, they use essentially
the atomic densities.

00:33:34.930 --> 00:33:38.950
So people have calculated
the atomic electron densities

00:33:38.950 --> 00:33:40.180
with [INAUDIBLE] methods.

00:33:40.180 --> 00:33:42.700
And they're actually tabulated
in these Clementi and Roetti

00:33:42.700 --> 00:33:43.200
tables.

00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:48.270
And you know, I'm just
sort of showing you

00:33:48.270 --> 00:33:50.480
that they're basically
parameterized

00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:53.960
by a bunch of Gaussians,
but you can get those.

00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:56.970
So you can get those functions.

00:33:56.970 --> 00:33:58.040
We skipped through that.

00:33:58.040 --> 00:33:59.070
OK.

00:33:59.070 --> 00:34:01.590
So remember that if you have--

00:34:01.590 --> 00:34:02.615
yes, sir.

00:34:02.615 --> 00:34:05.530
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:34:05.530 --> 00:34:06.970
PROFESSOR: Correct.

00:34:06.970 --> 00:34:09.100
Correct.

00:34:09.100 --> 00:34:11.110
Well, it's a distance
dependent function.

00:34:11.110 --> 00:34:13.670
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:13.670 --> 00:34:14.510
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:34:14.510 --> 00:34:14.929
Yeah.

00:34:14.929 --> 00:34:16.929
So it's sort of what
people in quantum mechanics

00:34:16.929 --> 00:34:19.159
think of as sort of non
self-consistent methods.

00:34:22.772 --> 00:34:25.400
You literally treat
the electron density

00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:29.150
of the crystal as the overlap
of the atomic densities

00:34:29.150 --> 00:34:31.400
of the atoms.

00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:33.650
The reason that saves you
here is that you're actually

00:34:33.650 --> 00:34:36.043
not going to do quantum
mechanics on that density,

00:34:36.043 --> 00:34:37.460
and you're just
using that density

00:34:37.460 --> 00:34:40.260
as some measure of coordination.

00:34:40.260 --> 00:34:44.924
So [INAUDIBLE] I
skipped some slides.

00:34:51.322 --> 00:34:52.739
Somehow, I lost
the slide in here.

00:34:52.739 --> 00:34:53.449
Sorry about that.

00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:00.300
OK.

00:35:00.300 --> 00:35:00.883
You know what?

00:35:00.883 --> 00:35:02.163
I put it in the wrong place.

00:35:02.163 --> 00:35:03.070
Here we go.

00:35:03.070 --> 00:35:08.940
So the way you write the energy
in the embedded atom method

00:35:08.940 --> 00:35:12.360
is you write it as the
embedding energy, which

00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:15.780
is you sum over every atom.

00:35:15.780 --> 00:35:19.890
And you're looking for
it's cohesive energy, which

00:35:19.890 --> 00:35:25.680
is some function F
of the neighborhood

00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:27.750
measurements, which
is the electron

00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:29.280
density at the site of i.

00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:32.190
And that's your summing
from these functions F

00:35:32.190 --> 00:35:33.600
which are the
projected densities

00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:38.580
from all the other atoms J.

00:35:38.580 --> 00:35:43.440
So this is the nonlinear
part of the energy.

00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:49.350
Typically, that is supplemented
with a pair potential.

00:35:49.350 --> 00:35:51.840
So the standard
embedded atom method

00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:53.760
is a pair potential
which is often

00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:57.930
just used for having a
repulsive part and a nonlinear

00:35:57.930 --> 00:35:59.920
embedding energy.

00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:02.880
So that means we have
to solve three problems,

00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:04.230
really-- the one we've solved.

00:36:04.230 --> 00:36:06.420
You need to know what the
electron densities are.

00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:08.170
Take the Clementi
and Roetti tables.

00:36:08.170 --> 00:36:10.170
You need to know what the
embedding function is,

00:36:10.170 --> 00:36:12.690
and you need to know what
the pair potential is.

00:36:12.690 --> 00:36:14.240
The pair potential,
to be honest,

00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:15.850
you can use almost anything.

00:36:15.850 --> 00:36:19.440
It's mainly used for the
hardcore repulsion part.

00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:21.900
You don't want the atoms
to fly into each other.

00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:26.700
Typically, they use some
screened electrostatic form

00:36:26.700 --> 00:36:30.990
which is essentially the
product of charge distribution

00:36:30.990 --> 00:36:32.740
functions on atoms.

00:36:32.740 --> 00:36:35.820
But you know, nothing would
stop you if you really wanted to

00:36:35.820 --> 00:36:37.350
from using a Leonard-Jones.

00:36:37.350 --> 00:36:39.000
I'll show you in a
second that there

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:44.010
is ambiguity about the division
of energy between the embedding

00:36:44.010 --> 00:36:47.305
part and the pair
potential is not unique.

00:36:47.305 --> 00:36:49.680
So that means, every time you
change your pair potential,

00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:51.597
you'll have to change
your embedding function.

00:36:51.597 --> 00:36:53.933
I'll show that in a second.

00:36:53.933 --> 00:36:55.725
What do you use for
the embedding function?

00:37:01.250 --> 00:37:04.620
There are two ways
that it can be done.

00:37:04.620 --> 00:37:08.750
People have written
down analytical forms

00:37:08.750 --> 00:37:10.760
with some theoretical
justification

00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:12.890
that I'm not going to go into.

00:37:12.890 --> 00:37:14.960
There's actually an
excellent review article

00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:16.490
on the embedded
atom methods which

00:37:16.490 --> 00:37:19.880
we post just for internal
use on the website.

00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:22.820
It's a 1993 Materials Science
and Engineering report.

00:37:22.820 --> 00:37:26.970
It's a really long paper, but
it's really an excellent paper.

00:37:26.970 --> 00:37:29.688
So there are analytical forms.

00:37:29.688 --> 00:37:30.980
And here's a few of them given.

00:37:30.980 --> 00:37:32.647
And people have come
up with other ones.

00:37:32.647 --> 00:37:34.430
More and more now,
what people simply do

00:37:34.430 --> 00:37:37.160
is tabulate the
embedding function.

00:37:37.160 --> 00:37:39.560
And really what they
do is they tabulate it

00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:42.840
so that you exactly reproduce
the equation of state.

00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:44.090
What is the equation of state?

00:37:44.090 --> 00:37:46.940
The equation of state is
energy versus volume or lattice

00:37:46.940 --> 00:37:48.440
parameter.

00:37:48.440 --> 00:37:51.560
So say at every level parameter,
you could try to get that

00:37:51.560 --> 00:37:55.250
energy with a better method--
say, quantum mechanics--

00:37:55.250 --> 00:37:57.060
and then fit your
embedding function

00:37:57.060 --> 00:37:59.910
so that you exactly
reproduce that.

00:37:59.910 --> 00:38:04.280
And so, often, the embedding
function is tabulated.

00:38:04.280 --> 00:38:10.030
But commonly it has this form.

00:38:10.030 --> 00:38:14.630
It's decaying, it's sort
of decreasing convex,

00:38:14.630 --> 00:38:17.210
decreasing in energy
and convex, and it

00:38:17.210 --> 00:38:18.950
needs both those properties.

00:38:18.950 --> 00:38:21.920
Well, why does it need to
be decreasing in energy?

00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:26.060
So this is the embedding
density and this is the value

00:38:26.060 --> 00:38:27.690
of the embedding function.

00:38:27.690 --> 00:38:30.650
Of course, as you put
more density on a site,

00:38:30.650 --> 00:38:31.970
that comes from more neighbors.

00:38:31.970 --> 00:38:34.863
So your cohesive energy
should be going down.

00:38:34.863 --> 00:38:37.280
That's why the energy of the
embedding function goes down.

00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:41.450
But it needs to be convex
because convexity gives you

00:38:41.450 --> 00:38:43.400
sort of the correct behavior.

00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:46.700
Convexity really tells you that
adding a bond going from here

00:38:46.700 --> 00:38:47.450
to here--

00:38:47.450 --> 00:38:50.540
let's say a bond is adding 0.01.

00:38:50.540 --> 00:38:56.150
So if we added a bond
here, we'd get this change

00:38:56.150 --> 00:38:58.010
in embedding energy.

00:38:58.010 --> 00:39:03.220
If we added it here, we'd
only get that change.

00:39:03.220 --> 00:39:05.520
So the function has to
be convex in some sense.

00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:09.290
Decrease has to be per
unit, and electron density

00:39:09.290 --> 00:39:12.260
has to be less for higher
densities than for lower.

00:39:12.260 --> 00:39:15.080
And that's the
definition of convex.

00:39:15.080 --> 00:39:19.640
The slope of it has to be
increasing of this function.

00:39:19.640 --> 00:39:23.630
And you see, that's going
to by construction now get

00:39:23.630 --> 00:39:26.300
some of our problems
right because this shape

00:39:26.300 --> 00:39:28.310
of the function,
the convexity is

00:39:28.310 --> 00:39:31.880
what tells you that
the low coordination

00:39:31.880 --> 00:39:34.700
bonds are stronger than the
high coordination bonds.

00:39:37.553 --> 00:39:38.970
So you can already
guess from this

00:39:38.970 --> 00:39:40.887
that we're going to get
a lot of things right.

00:39:48.380 --> 00:39:50.220
I'll show you some
examples in a second.

00:39:53.860 --> 00:39:57.438
What's the physical concept
that sort of justifies

00:39:57.438 --> 00:39:58.480
the embedded atom method?

00:40:03.190 --> 00:40:06.700
There are things
you can do formally

00:40:06.700 --> 00:40:11.800
in ab initio theory
showing that in fairly

00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:13.430
simple tight binding models.

00:40:13.430 --> 00:40:16.630
So these are things
that have the structure

00:40:16.630 --> 00:40:20.560
of a proper quantum
mechanical Hamiltonian,

00:40:20.560 --> 00:40:23.590
but they are parameterized
forms of a Hamiltonian.

00:40:23.590 --> 00:40:25.270
But still, what they
all tend to show

00:40:25.270 --> 00:40:29.440
is that the cohesive energy
in highly delocalized systems

00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:31.390
to first order goals
like the square root

00:40:31.390 --> 00:40:33.470
of the coordination.

00:40:33.470 --> 00:40:35.020
So you can get
some justification

00:40:35.020 --> 00:40:37.450
for this nonlinear behavior.

00:40:37.450 --> 00:40:41.050
A somewhat intuitive concept of
where the bonding energy comes

00:40:41.050 --> 00:40:46.510
from is that actually,
if you put an atom

00:40:46.510 --> 00:40:52.570
in a metallic solid, where does
it get a cohesive energy from?

00:40:52.570 --> 00:40:55.570
For the most part, it
gets its cohesive energy

00:40:55.570 --> 00:40:59.410
from the delocalization
of its electrons.

00:40:59.410 --> 00:41:03.292
And that's largely a
kinetic energy effect.

00:41:03.292 --> 00:41:05.500
Remember that the kinetic
energy in quantum mechanics

00:41:05.500 --> 00:41:07.930
is the curvature of
the wave function.

00:41:07.930 --> 00:41:15.070
It's d squared phi, dx squared
if you it in one dimension.

00:41:15.070 --> 00:41:19.690
So highly curved wave functions
have high kinetic energy.

00:41:19.690 --> 00:41:22.420
So if you can
actually delocalize,

00:41:22.420 --> 00:41:24.940
your wave function
becomes, in some sense,

00:41:24.940 --> 00:41:27.190
much smoother with
much less curvature,

00:41:27.190 --> 00:41:30.500
and you have lower
kinetic energy.

00:41:30.500 --> 00:41:34.060
So if you believe that a lot
of bonding cohesive energy

00:41:34.060 --> 00:41:36.280
and delocalized source
comes from that,

00:41:36.280 --> 00:41:38.110
then the measure
of cohesive energy

00:41:38.110 --> 00:41:42.520
is essentially how well
you can delocalize it.

00:41:42.520 --> 00:41:47.380
So what do you measure
with the embedding density?

00:41:47.380 --> 00:41:50.380
If you measure the
electron density coming

00:41:50.380 --> 00:41:53.170
from atoms, the reason this
works is that that's probably

00:41:53.170 --> 00:41:55.420
a very good measure over
the number of states

00:41:55.420 --> 00:41:57.550
you can delocalize over.

00:41:57.550 --> 00:41:59.063
Things with higher
electron density

00:41:59.063 --> 00:42:00.730
tend to have a higher
number of states--

00:42:00.730 --> 00:42:02.380
higher densities of states.

00:42:02.380 --> 00:42:04.780
And so you can delocalize
over more states.

00:42:04.780 --> 00:42:10.210
And that's the somewhat
intuitive explanation

00:42:10.210 --> 00:42:12.010
for why the embedded atom works.

00:42:12.010 --> 00:42:14.450
I mean, people have given
somewhat other explanations.

00:42:14.450 --> 00:42:18.160
They could say, well,
the electron density

00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:20.710
that I see from a
neighboring atom measures

00:42:20.710 --> 00:42:23.600
the number of electrons
I can bond with.

00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:27.130
But that's not totally true
because if those electrons come

00:42:27.130 --> 00:42:31.810
from a filled shell, there's
nothing I can do with them.

00:42:31.810 --> 00:42:34.120
So somehow, I tend
to believe more

00:42:34.120 --> 00:42:36.580
it's really a measure of
the delocalization you see.

00:42:49.240 --> 00:42:51.070
The embedded atom
method is-- yes, sir?

00:42:51.070 --> 00:42:53.500
AUDIENCE: Did you
say [INAUDIBLE]??

00:43:00.790 --> 00:43:01.762
PROFESSOR: Correct.

00:43:01.762 --> 00:43:02.637
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:02.637 --> 00:43:03.390
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:43:03.390 --> 00:43:03.890
Yeah.

00:43:03.890 --> 00:43:07.010
So in an atom, you actually have
a much higher kinetic energy

00:43:07.010 --> 00:43:09.650
because your state is
much more localized.

00:43:09.650 --> 00:43:11.150
The embedded atom
method is probably

00:43:11.150 --> 00:43:14.360
the most popular one of
all these effective medium

00:43:14.360 --> 00:43:15.050
theories.

00:43:15.050 --> 00:43:18.020
But you'll see other
ones with other names

00:43:18.020 --> 00:43:21.350
that are in spirit very much
the same-- things like the glue

00:43:21.350 --> 00:43:22.640
model.

00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:24.560
Finnis-Sinclair
potentials, which

00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:27.560
slightly predate the
embedded atom method, which

00:43:27.560 --> 00:43:30.390
are also non-linear potentials.

00:43:30.390 --> 00:43:33.920
So they're really particle
potential pair functionals.

00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:36.230
And the equivalent crystal
models Smith and Banerjee.

00:43:36.230 --> 00:43:40.940
These are all exactly
in the same spirit.

00:43:40.940 --> 00:43:43.820
The brilliance of the
embedded atom method

00:43:43.820 --> 00:43:47.300
was essentially that it
was something for nothing.

00:43:47.300 --> 00:43:49.370
The computational
cost is essentially

00:43:49.370 --> 00:43:52.430
the same as for doing pair
potentials because you

00:43:52.430 --> 00:43:54.950
sum things only pairwise.

00:43:54.950 --> 00:43:57.410
If you think of what you
need to do an embedded atom

00:43:57.410 --> 00:44:02.330
calculation, you have
your pair potential.

00:44:02.330 --> 00:44:03.950
That's a pairwise sum.

00:44:03.950 --> 00:44:07.670
But your embedding energy
is also a pairwise sum.

00:44:07.670 --> 00:44:09.800
Because what you
have to do per atom,

00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:11.390
you just have to
sum the electron

00:44:11.390 --> 00:44:16.430
density coming from a bunch
of other atoms around you.

00:44:16.430 --> 00:44:17.773
So that's a pairwise sum.

00:44:17.773 --> 00:44:19.190
And then you just
have to stick it

00:44:19.190 --> 00:44:21.860
in F, which is an
extra evaluation.

00:44:21.860 --> 00:44:27.690
But embedded atom fundamentally
scales only like N squared.

00:44:27.690 --> 00:44:29.660
So that was the
brilliant part of it.

00:44:29.660 --> 00:44:32.270
Or in the end, that's
what made it successful.

00:44:32.270 --> 00:44:36.890
You could essentially
do much better things

00:44:36.890 --> 00:44:39.590
with almost the same
effort as pair potentials.

00:44:39.590 --> 00:44:41.600
And that's why it sort
of took off as a method.

00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:43.130
And pretty much
anybody in metals

00:44:43.130 --> 00:44:46.310
now would use
embedded atom if they

00:44:46.310 --> 00:44:47.840
want to get any physics right.

00:44:47.840 --> 00:44:50.570
If you want to do demonstration
projects or things

00:44:50.570 --> 00:44:52.340
like want to do
billions of atoms,

00:44:52.340 --> 00:44:55.010
there can be reasons to go
through much simpler forces

00:44:55.010 --> 00:44:56.960
still to evaluate.

00:44:56.960 --> 00:44:59.360
But in metals, there's
really no reason

00:44:59.360 --> 00:45:03.368
not to use EM over
simple pair potentials.

00:45:06.950 --> 00:45:08.620
What do people fit to?

00:45:08.620 --> 00:45:11.650
People fit to anything,
like I told you before.

00:45:11.650 --> 00:45:14.440
The original EM potentials
were fit to a standard set

00:45:14.440 --> 00:45:17.110
of data, which was lattice
parameter, sublimation

00:45:17.110 --> 00:45:22.180
energy, elastic constants, and
vacancy formation energies.

00:45:22.180 --> 00:45:25.870
Now you'll regularly see papers
in the literature claiming,

00:45:25.870 --> 00:45:28.390
I have a better potential
than you for aluminum,

00:45:28.390 --> 00:45:30.670
and I have a better potential
than you for nickel.

00:45:30.670 --> 00:45:32.210
And some of that is true.

00:45:32.210 --> 00:45:34.390
So people are not in the
game of kind of super

00:45:34.390 --> 00:45:37.900
optimizing these potentials
for what it's worth.

00:45:37.900 --> 00:45:40.990
But the original database was
a set of standard potentials--

00:45:40.990 --> 00:45:43.510
largely unknowable metal alloys.

00:45:43.510 --> 00:45:47.350
People have spent a lot of
time finding better potentials

00:45:47.350 --> 00:45:50.380
on technologically important
alloys like nickel aluminum.

00:45:50.380 --> 00:45:53.320
You'll find at least
five potentials

00:45:53.320 --> 00:45:56.500
who all claim to be better
than somebody else's potential

00:45:56.500 --> 00:45:58.090
on the nickel aluminum system.

00:46:02.770 --> 00:46:05.550
So what I want to do now is
just show you some results.

00:46:05.550 --> 00:46:07.900
And we're not going to
analyze these in great deal.

00:46:07.900 --> 00:46:10.440
But I want to show you so
you get some idea of what

00:46:10.440 --> 00:46:12.750
people do with this stuff.

00:46:12.750 --> 00:46:17.700
Here's linear thermal expansion
for a bunch of late transition

00:46:17.700 --> 00:46:22.020
metals calculated in EM and
calculated in experiment.

00:46:22.020 --> 00:46:25.690
And these agree pretty well.

00:46:25.690 --> 00:46:30.090
That's maybe not a big surprise
in close packed solids.

00:46:30.090 --> 00:46:32.250
The thermal expansion
is largely a measure

00:46:32.250 --> 00:46:35.650
of the asymmetry of
your equation of state.

00:46:35.650 --> 00:46:37.750
I mean, in complex
materials, that's not true.

00:46:37.750 --> 00:46:40.270
But in simple,
close packed metals.

00:46:40.270 --> 00:46:43.760
Remember, your equation of
state is slightly asymmetric.

00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:48.630
It curves less towards the
high lattice parameters

00:46:48.630 --> 00:46:49.880
and the low lattice parameter.

00:46:49.880 --> 00:46:55.950
So if you draw
energy versus volume,

00:46:55.950 --> 00:46:58.500
it's asymmetric
around the minimum.

00:46:58.500 --> 00:47:00.365
And that's why you
have thermal expansion.

00:47:00.365 --> 00:47:00.990
Think about it.

00:47:00.990 --> 00:47:03.780
It's slightly easier to
fluctuate to the higher volume

00:47:03.780 --> 00:47:07.350
than to the lower volume.

00:47:07.350 --> 00:47:08.285
Yes, sir?

00:47:08.285 --> 00:47:12.380
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:12.380 --> 00:47:14.390
PROFESSOR: Oh, good point.

00:47:14.390 --> 00:47:16.370
There is, of course, no
temperature dependence

00:47:16.370 --> 00:47:18.090
in the potential itself.

00:47:18.090 --> 00:47:22.370
So to do something
like thermal expansion,

00:47:22.370 --> 00:47:26.240
you either have to do a dynamic
simulation like molecular

00:47:26.240 --> 00:47:29.210
dynamics-- and
we'll come to that--

00:47:29.210 --> 00:47:32.090
or you have to
explicitly calculate

00:47:32.090 --> 00:47:34.970
the entropic factors that give
you thermal expansion, which

00:47:34.970 --> 00:47:37.430
is essentially the
dependence of the phonon

00:47:37.430 --> 00:47:39.290
frequencies on volume.

00:47:39.290 --> 00:47:41.540
So you can indirectly calculate
the thermal expansion.

00:47:41.540 --> 00:47:44.525
But we sort of
haven't got into-- we

00:47:44.525 --> 00:47:45.770
will go into micro dynamics.

00:47:45.770 --> 00:47:47.437
But of course, in the
potential, there's

00:47:47.437 --> 00:47:49.347
no temperature dependence.

00:47:58.410 --> 00:48:02.260
Here's activation barriers
for self-diffusion in metals.

00:48:02.260 --> 00:48:05.020
These are almost too
good to believe it.

00:48:05.020 --> 00:48:08.570
You actually don't get them this
good with quantum mechanics.

00:48:08.570 --> 00:48:12.580
So it's almost surprising to
me that they're this good,

00:48:12.580 --> 00:48:14.080
if you compare EM to external.

00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:18.980
So this is the
activation barrier for--

00:48:18.980 --> 00:48:19.720
I forget.

00:48:19.720 --> 00:48:22.020
But I thought it was
interstitials self-diffusion,

00:48:22.020 --> 00:48:25.180
but I'm not for sure whether
it was interstitial or vacancy

00:48:25.180 --> 00:48:26.395
self-diffusion.

00:48:30.360 --> 00:48:34.350
You know, here's a bunch
of surface energies.

00:48:34.350 --> 00:48:38.580
These are not quite as
good as the experiment.

00:48:38.580 --> 00:48:44.020
If you, for example,
look at copper,

00:48:44.020 --> 00:48:50.480
here's the experimental number
in ergs per centimeter squared.

00:48:50.480 --> 00:48:54.220
And here is the calculation
on different facets.

00:48:54.220 --> 00:48:56.680
Because of course,
often experimentally

00:48:56.680 --> 00:48:59.560
you measure some average
of different facets.

00:48:59.560 --> 00:49:01.810
Unless you do careful
single crystal work,

00:49:01.810 --> 00:49:04.653
you have some average.

00:49:04.653 --> 00:49:06.820
On the calculations you
have to calculate the energy

00:49:06.820 --> 00:49:07.900
on a specific surface.

00:49:07.900 --> 00:49:09.520
And that's actually
one of the things

00:49:09.520 --> 00:49:11.630
you're going to do in the lab.

00:49:11.630 --> 00:49:14.590
So these are a little lower.

00:49:14.590 --> 00:49:17.350
And that seems to be a rather
consistent problem that is,

00:49:17.350 --> 00:49:20.670
for example, also in platinum.

00:49:20.670 --> 00:49:25.290
These are quite a bit
lower than the experiment.

00:49:25.290 --> 00:49:28.950
So that may tell you
that either there

00:49:28.950 --> 00:49:32.310
are more complicated quantum
mechanical effects going on

00:49:32.310 --> 00:49:36.360
that you don't capture with
these simple energy models.

00:49:36.360 --> 00:49:39.360
But sometimes, it also means
the experiment is wrong.

00:49:39.360 --> 00:49:42.840
I think in this case, platinum
is a fairly easy metal

00:49:42.840 --> 00:49:45.090
to deal with clean.

00:49:45.090 --> 00:49:46.980
But surface energies
of materials

00:49:46.980 --> 00:49:50.750
is sort of notoriously
difficult to get experimental.

00:49:54.590 --> 00:49:56.910
Here's a phonon dispersion
curve for copper.

00:49:56.910 --> 00:49:58.620
Again, don't worry
about the details.

00:49:58.620 --> 00:50:01.280
I just wanted to show you
the kind of things people do.

00:50:01.280 --> 00:50:05.510
Calculations are the
lines and the points

00:50:05.510 --> 00:50:07.280
are the measurements.

00:50:07.280 --> 00:50:10.310
So, reasonably good
at some of these.

00:50:10.310 --> 00:50:12.890
High frequencies there seems
to be some problems with.

00:50:17.200 --> 00:50:18.610
Melting point.

00:50:18.610 --> 00:50:21.070
Again, this would have been
done with molecular dynamics

00:50:21.070 --> 00:50:23.050
and then free
energy integration.

00:50:23.050 --> 00:50:27.840
And again, for most materials,
these come out remarkably well.

00:50:27.840 --> 00:50:29.620
So, look at this.

00:50:29.620 --> 00:50:32.945
Except again for the very
late transition metals

00:50:32.945 --> 00:50:34.570
like palladium and
platinum, there just

00:50:34.570 --> 00:50:37.240
seems to be some
amount of problems.

00:50:37.240 --> 00:50:40.840
I can tell you in a second
about the limitations

00:50:40.840 --> 00:50:41.800
of these methods.

00:50:41.800 --> 00:50:48.080
And they may be related to the
unusual electronic structure

00:50:48.080 --> 00:50:49.450
of palladium and platinum.

00:50:52.210 --> 00:50:54.280
You know, here's a pair
correlation function

00:50:54.280 --> 00:50:56.290
in a liquid.

00:50:56.290 --> 00:50:58.150
[? People, ?]
[? we're ?] [? good? ?]

00:50:58.150 --> 00:51:01.090
A grain boundary.

00:51:01.090 --> 00:51:02.890
This is something
you simply could not

00:51:02.890 --> 00:51:05.590
do with a pair
potential in metals

00:51:05.590 --> 00:51:08.020
because when you calculate
a grain boundary,

00:51:08.020 --> 00:51:12.790
you really are dealing
with different coordinated

00:51:12.790 --> 00:51:14.020
environments.

00:51:14.020 --> 00:51:16.120
And the painful thing
about a grain boundary

00:51:16.120 --> 00:51:20.477
is that you don't know ahead of
time what kind of coordinations

00:51:20.477 --> 00:51:21.310
you're going to see.

00:51:21.310 --> 00:51:24.258
And you're going to see
multiple coordinations.

00:51:24.258 --> 00:51:26.050
See, but people with
potentials always get,

00:51:26.050 --> 00:51:29.070
if I know I'm going to
deal with a surface,

00:51:29.070 --> 00:51:31.290
I can make a pair
potential that's

00:51:31.290 --> 00:51:34.650
pretty good for those
coordinations at the surface.

00:51:34.650 --> 00:51:36.960
If I deal with the bulk,
I make a pair potential

00:51:36.960 --> 00:51:39.373
that's pretty good with
bulk coordinations.

00:51:39.373 --> 00:51:41.040
It's when you work
with grain boundaries

00:51:41.040 --> 00:51:43.980
that you kind of end up with
all kinds of coordinations

00:51:43.980 --> 00:51:45.930
because the atoms in
the grain boundary,

00:51:45.930 --> 00:51:48.930
some are high coordinated,
some are low coordinated,

00:51:48.930 --> 00:51:51.630
depending on how the
grains contact each other.

00:51:55.660 --> 00:52:00.070
So it's a great method, but
it still has its limitations.

00:52:00.070 --> 00:52:04.440
One is that the
bonding is spherical.

00:52:04.440 --> 00:52:07.950
You literally sum all
the electron density

00:52:07.950 --> 00:52:12.670
coming from around you, and
you really just sum it up.

00:52:12.670 --> 00:52:14.820
You don't keep track of
its orientation dependence.

00:52:14.820 --> 00:52:19.140
So having one atom there next
to me and one atom on that side

00:52:19.140 --> 00:52:22.693
is the same as having both
straight in front of me

00:52:22.693 --> 00:52:24.735
because I just sum up the
electron density coming

00:52:24.735 --> 00:52:27.810
from them So it's
purely spherical.

00:52:27.810 --> 00:52:30.330
That can be fixed.

00:52:30.330 --> 00:52:34.380
About in the '90s, [? Mike ?]
[? Baskis ?] developed

00:52:34.380 --> 00:52:38.460
what's called a MEAM, and
that just stands for modified

00:52:38.460 --> 00:52:42.660
embedded atom method, which
basically has embedding

00:52:42.660 --> 00:52:47.160
functions that keep track
of the angular dependence

00:52:47.160 --> 00:52:49.110
of the electron
density around you,

00:52:49.110 --> 00:52:51.600
essentially by mapping the
problem on to spherical

00:52:51.600 --> 00:52:53.100
harmonics.

00:52:53.100 --> 00:52:57.360
MEAM is not nearly as
popular as the standard EM

00:52:57.360 --> 00:53:02.310
because it adds a level of
complexity to the method.

00:53:02.310 --> 00:53:05.790
And it's not totally
clear that you're

00:53:05.790 --> 00:53:09.360
making things work because
the physics is better

00:53:09.360 --> 00:53:11.922
or you just have more
fitting parameters.

00:53:11.922 --> 00:53:14.130
[? Mike ?] [? Baskis ?]
originally developed the MEAM

00:53:14.130 --> 00:53:17.850
to work on silicon where
angular dependence clearly seems

00:53:17.850 --> 00:53:19.450
to play an important role.

00:53:19.450 --> 00:53:21.950
Yes, sir?

00:53:21.950 --> 00:53:25.304
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:53:37.652 --> 00:53:38.860
PROFESSOR: Well, your force--

00:53:38.860 --> 00:53:39.220
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:53:39.220 --> 00:53:39.887
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:53:39.887 --> 00:53:41.860
Your force is
directional dependent

00:53:41.860 --> 00:53:45.490
because you're taking
the derivative of energy

00:53:45.490 --> 00:53:49.330
with respect to a vector,
which is some distance.

00:53:49.330 --> 00:53:50.277
But--

00:53:50.277 --> 00:53:53.546
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:54:00.130 --> 00:54:03.130
PROFESSOR: But again, the force
will be directional dependent.

00:54:03.130 --> 00:54:04.520
Let me show you an example.

00:54:04.520 --> 00:54:07.720
Let's say I have a
central atom here

00:54:07.720 --> 00:54:11.950
and I got four atoms around it.

00:54:11.950 --> 00:54:16.080
The force will be directional
dependent because--

00:54:16.080 --> 00:54:17.380
what is the force?

00:54:17.380 --> 00:54:20.050
The force is how the
energy of an atom

00:54:20.050 --> 00:54:23.535
changes as I move it into
a particular direction.

00:54:23.535 --> 00:54:24.910
So the force along
this direction

00:54:24.910 --> 00:54:27.730
is the energy change as I move
the atom along this direction

00:54:27.730 --> 00:54:30.880
because it is the derivative of
the total energy with respect

00:54:30.880 --> 00:54:35.000
to some unit vector
in that direction.

00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:36.652
See, if I change
in this direction,

00:54:36.652 --> 00:54:38.110
I'm going to
significantly increase

00:54:38.110 --> 00:54:40.480
the overlap with that atom.

00:54:40.480 --> 00:54:44.980
But if I change it,
say, in this direction,

00:54:44.980 --> 00:54:49.030
that's not necessarily
the same derivative

00:54:49.030 --> 00:54:51.360
than in this direction.

00:54:51.360 --> 00:54:55.080
So the force will be directional
dependent just because

00:54:55.080 --> 00:54:58.530
of the crystallography,
but the energy is not.

00:54:58.530 --> 00:55:01.530
So what I mean
with that is that--

00:55:01.530 --> 00:55:08.570
let's call this some unit
length L, and they're all at L.

00:55:08.570 --> 00:55:15.750
If I do this, and
here's my central atom,

00:55:15.750 --> 00:55:22.400
and these are all L, that gives
me exactly the same embedding

00:55:22.400 --> 00:55:24.585
energy as in the first problem.

00:55:24.585 --> 00:55:26.460
Of course, the total
energy will be different

00:55:26.460 --> 00:55:29.480
because these guys
interact very closely.

00:55:29.480 --> 00:55:31.370
But the bonding energy
of the central atom

00:55:31.370 --> 00:55:32.570
is exactly the same.

00:55:32.570 --> 00:55:34.850
And that's what I mean
with no angular dependence.

00:55:37.590 --> 00:55:41.130
It doesn't in the end see
what orbitals that electron

00:55:41.130 --> 00:55:44.450
density comes from.

00:55:44.450 --> 00:55:46.700
And when you think about
angular dependence,

00:55:46.700 --> 00:55:50.630
in the end, what it is, it
is polarization of orbitals.

00:55:50.630 --> 00:55:52.980
Think of sp3 bonding.

00:55:52.980 --> 00:55:54.940
What is that really telling you?

00:55:54.940 --> 00:55:58.010
If I do an sp3 hybrid
along this direction,

00:55:58.010 --> 00:56:00.290
I'm really starting to
polarize the orbitals along--

00:56:00.290 --> 00:56:00.790
what is it--

00:56:00.790 --> 00:56:03.300
109 degrees in other directions.

00:56:03.300 --> 00:56:08.190
So I really need to try to get
my bonds in those directions.

00:56:08.190 --> 00:56:11.090
So that's essentially what
angular dependence comes from.

00:56:13.640 --> 00:56:14.425
Does that help?

00:56:14.425 --> 00:56:16.050
AUDIENCE: [? I ?]
[? think ?] [? so. ?]

00:56:16.050 --> 00:56:16.768
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:56:16.768 --> 00:56:17.310
You think so.

00:56:17.310 --> 00:56:20.540
Well, let me know if it doesn't.

00:56:20.540 --> 00:56:22.970
OK.

00:56:22.970 --> 00:56:24.710
The other problem
is-- which is more

00:56:24.710 --> 00:56:27.542
a technical problem-- is that
the potential is not unique.

00:56:27.542 --> 00:56:29.000
And this is something
you just have

00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:30.770
to be careful with
if you start messing

00:56:30.770 --> 00:56:33.410
around with potential
files yourself.

00:56:33.410 --> 00:56:38.420
If you're going to use it as a
black box, you're probably OK.

00:56:38.420 --> 00:56:40.100
Let me get you
some notes on that.

00:56:48.982 --> 00:56:51.190
The way you can see that
the potential is not unique.

00:56:54.230 --> 00:56:58.400
If I have an embedding
function F of rho,

00:56:58.400 --> 00:57:01.100
if I define another
embedding function-- we

00:57:01.100 --> 00:57:04.160
call it G of rho-- they're
always the electron density.

00:57:04.160 --> 00:57:09.650
And I say, that's F of rho
plus some linear term in rho.

00:57:12.380 --> 00:57:17.230
You could make the total energy
function exactly the same

00:57:17.230 --> 00:57:18.980
with either of the two
embedding functions

00:57:18.980 --> 00:57:20.660
just by changing
the pair potential.

00:57:20.660 --> 00:57:22.100
And let me show you that.

00:57:22.100 --> 00:57:30.260
If I write the energy
as the sum over atoms,

00:57:30.260 --> 00:57:36.600
the embedding function on
that atom, plus some air

00:57:36.600 --> 00:57:37.500
potential part.

00:57:48.130 --> 00:57:51.920
Let me substitute this in.

00:57:51.920 --> 00:57:56.050
So I get that this is sum i.

00:57:56.050 --> 00:58:13.850
Fi rho plus 1/2 sum
iJ psi iJ, RiJ, plus--

00:58:13.850 --> 00:58:26.310
let me-- sum i k sum J
[? not equal ?] i of f

00:58:26.310 --> 00:58:36.090
rj where rho i was sum j f.

00:58:36.090 --> 00:58:37.390
OK.

00:58:37.390 --> 00:58:41.310
Essentially, if you want
to look through the math,

00:58:41.310 --> 00:58:43.380
don't worry too much about it.

00:58:43.380 --> 00:58:46.320
If you do a linear
transformation on the embedding

00:58:46.320 --> 00:58:52.380
function, you see this term
is linear in things coming

00:58:52.380 --> 00:58:54.960
from the atoms around it.

00:58:54.960 --> 00:58:58.990
It's linear in these
electron density functions.

00:58:58.990 --> 00:59:02.220
So anything that's
linear in functions

00:59:02.220 --> 00:59:05.593
that I sum from the other atoms
is just like a pair potential

00:59:05.593 --> 00:59:07.260
because that's what
a pair potential is.

00:59:07.260 --> 00:59:09.900
I sum contributions, OK?

00:59:09.900 --> 00:59:12.720
I add up contributions
from the things around me.

00:59:12.720 --> 00:59:15.580
So I'm linear in
that contribution.

00:59:15.580 --> 00:59:19.200
So any linear part of
the embedding function

00:59:19.200 --> 00:59:20.600
just looks like a potential.

00:59:20.600 --> 00:59:21.870
This is a pair potential.

00:59:21.870 --> 00:59:24.300
This is the sum over
[? 2n. ?] This is i an J,

00:59:24.300 --> 00:59:25.950
and I add something up.

00:59:25.950 --> 00:59:30.600
So this I could
just add the psi.

00:59:30.600 --> 00:59:34.320
So if I add psi to this and
use the embedding function F,

00:59:34.320 --> 00:59:37.440
I have exactly the same as
using the embedding function G

00:59:37.440 --> 00:59:39.600
and using just
the potential psi.

00:59:39.600 --> 00:59:43.320
So the linear part you
can move arbitrarily

00:59:43.320 --> 00:59:48.150
between the embedding function
and the pair potential.

00:59:48.150 --> 00:59:53.170
So that tells you something
else that's kind of important.

00:59:53.170 --> 00:59:57.160
When is a pair potential
alone good in metals?

01:00:02.520 --> 01:00:05.610
It's when the embedding
part doesn't change.

01:00:05.610 --> 01:00:09.970
If my atoms stay roughly
at the same density,

01:00:09.970 --> 01:00:13.900
then all the changes come
from the pair potential part.

01:00:13.900 --> 01:00:15.010
OK?

01:00:15.010 --> 01:00:19.090
So what would you do--

01:00:19.090 --> 01:00:42.560
[INAUDIBLE]---- if you're
having an embedding function

01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:44.970
as a function of rho.

01:00:44.970 --> 01:00:49.940
If you're working,
say, at this density?

01:00:49.940 --> 01:00:51.690
Let's sort of say the
density of the bulk,

01:00:51.690 --> 01:00:53.790
and you're studying
bulk problems.

01:00:53.790 --> 01:00:58.600
You could take the slope of
this, take the linear term,

01:00:58.600 --> 01:01:01.170
make a linear
approximation to that

01:01:01.170 --> 01:01:02.910
and add that to
the pair potential,

01:01:02.910 --> 01:01:05.160
and now you wouldn't have
to worry about the embedding

01:01:05.160 --> 01:01:06.900
function.

01:01:06.900 --> 01:01:09.720
So at constant density,
pair potentials

01:01:09.720 --> 01:01:11.860
are actually pretty good.

01:01:11.860 --> 01:01:13.380
It's when the
density around you--

01:01:13.380 --> 01:01:15.013
the electron density
around you changes

01:01:15.013 --> 01:01:17.430
which is, in essence, a measure
of the coordination change

01:01:17.430 --> 01:01:19.770
that you run into trouble.

01:01:19.770 --> 01:01:22.470
And so, people have gone
into that game of making

01:01:22.470 --> 01:01:26.138
density dependent potentials.

01:01:26.138 --> 01:01:27.930
And so you would have
a different potential

01:01:27.930 --> 01:01:30.480
when you're near a surface
than when you're near the bulk.

01:01:40.460 --> 01:01:42.945
So my summary on
effective medium theories

01:01:42.945 --> 01:01:44.570
which I showed by
embedded atom methods

01:01:44.570 --> 01:01:47.198
is, in essence, that there's
no reason not to use them.

01:01:47.198 --> 01:01:48.740
If you've decided
you're going to use

01:01:48.740 --> 01:01:53.990
an empirical model for metals,
there's really no reason at all

01:01:53.990 --> 01:01:56.420
to use pair potentials.

01:01:56.420 --> 01:02:01.393
Embedded atom basically does
better at very little cost.

01:02:01.393 --> 01:02:02.810
Saying that it
does better doesn't

01:02:02.810 --> 01:02:06.180
say that the does everything.

01:02:06.180 --> 01:02:08.810
And I remember talking to people
like [? Mike ?] [? Baskis ?]

01:02:08.810 --> 01:02:09.860
who invented this.

01:02:09.860 --> 01:02:13.530
They're embarrassed for
kind of things people now do

01:02:13.530 --> 01:02:14.780
with the embedded atom method.

01:02:14.780 --> 01:02:17.900
Like with any successful method,
people push it way too hard

01:02:17.900 --> 01:02:21.080
and try to calculate all
kinds of subtle energy effects

01:02:21.080 --> 01:02:23.840
that it just never was made for.

01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:25.460
And you see people
write papers on,

01:02:25.460 --> 01:02:29.810
if I change my
constant by 1,000 here,

01:02:29.810 --> 01:02:31.760
I can get this phase correct.

01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:35.150
But in the end, it gives
you these gross coordination

01:02:35.150 --> 01:02:38.900
effects right, but it does
not give you very subtle

01:02:38.900 --> 01:02:41.570
hybridization effects right.

01:02:41.570 --> 01:02:46.550
Why, for example, were platinum
and palladium not so good?

01:02:46.550 --> 01:02:50.800
Because platinum and palladium
have almost filled or filled

01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:53.180
D bands.

01:02:53.180 --> 01:02:56.150
And as a function of the
environment around platinum

01:02:56.150 --> 01:02:59.240
and palladium, there is very
subtle electron transfer

01:02:59.240 --> 01:03:01.710
between the D band
and the S band.

01:03:01.710 --> 01:03:02.380
OK?

01:03:02.380 --> 01:03:04.380
And when you're just
measuring electron density,

01:03:04.380 --> 01:03:06.200
that all looks the
same, but those states

01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:08.750
behave very differently.

01:03:08.750 --> 01:03:11.420
So there will be always
subtle electronic change

01:03:11.420 --> 01:03:12.650
that you simply won't get.

01:03:12.650 --> 01:03:17.770
And if your system is really
influenced strongly by those,

01:03:17.770 --> 01:03:19.300
you won't get them right.

01:03:19.300 --> 01:03:23.480
For example, people try to
get complex crystal structure

01:03:23.480 --> 01:03:27.320
differences in metals with EM.

01:03:27.320 --> 01:03:29.230
You will just never
get there, period.

01:03:31.770 --> 01:03:33.500
Let's say you make an alloy--

01:03:33.500 --> 01:03:38.990
palladium ruthenium, whatever--
the crystal structure energy

01:03:38.990 --> 01:03:41.000
difference in that
[? material, ?] like in most

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:45.260
metals over the order of 5 to
10 millielectron [? volt. ?] You

01:03:45.260 --> 01:03:48.500
cannot get things right on that
scale with these kind of simple

01:03:48.500 --> 01:03:50.340
models, so you
shouldn't try too hard.

01:03:50.340 --> 01:03:52.340
But on the other hand,
if you're going to study,

01:03:52.340 --> 01:03:58.010
say, I don't know, fracture in
a material in a simple element

01:03:58.010 --> 01:04:01.160
like one of these big
movies I showed you,

01:04:01.160 --> 01:04:03.830
that's to a large extent
a topological event.

01:04:06.790 --> 01:04:10.515
You will get a lot of
essential pieces of that right.

01:04:10.515 --> 01:04:11.390
Because what is that?

01:04:11.390 --> 01:04:13.760
That's a coordination
change event, largely.

01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:17.278
You will get a lot of that right
by doing EM over potentials.

01:04:23.270 --> 01:04:25.250
This is a great
website I only added

01:04:25.250 --> 01:04:27.380
that this year to
the lecture I found.

01:04:27.380 --> 01:04:29.330
There's a group in
Japan that called

01:04:29.330 --> 01:04:34.820
themselves the [? EAMers. ?]
They even have a blog now.

01:04:34.820 --> 01:04:37.570
And so there's a lot of
cool stuff you can download.

01:04:37.570 --> 01:04:39.890
They have potential files.

01:04:39.890 --> 01:04:44.120
You can get EM code
from the Sandia site.

01:04:44.120 --> 01:04:46.050
It's a little hard to
get to, because Sandia

01:04:46.050 --> 01:04:50.240
being a national
lab, they're totally

01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:53.630
paranoid about
downloading anything.

01:04:53.630 --> 01:04:56.480
But there are sources where
you can get the EM code.

01:04:56.480 --> 01:04:59.360
It is technically
freely available.

01:04:59.360 --> 01:05:02.120
It's just not necessarily
trivial to get to it.

01:05:06.920 --> 01:05:12.120
So we talked about
pair functionals,

01:05:12.120 --> 01:05:13.870
which was this direction.

01:05:13.870 --> 01:05:15.390
So the other
direction is obviously

01:05:15.390 --> 01:05:18.240
to go to cluster potentials.

01:05:18.240 --> 01:05:20.880
Well, you know, I
don't like my expansion

01:05:20.880 --> 01:05:22.740
in just two-body terms.

01:05:22.740 --> 01:05:25.430
I'll start adding
three-body terms.

01:05:25.430 --> 01:05:26.920
It's the obvious extension.

01:05:26.920 --> 01:05:29.730
And if you don't like that,
you can go to four-body terms.

01:05:35.450 --> 01:05:37.280
That's definitely done.

01:05:37.280 --> 01:05:42.110
And for reasons I'll go into
in the next lecture on Tuesday,

01:05:42.110 --> 01:05:43.730
it's extremely
popular in the world

01:05:43.730 --> 01:05:46.610
of organics, where it's actually
really, really powerful.

01:05:46.610 --> 01:05:49.940
And we'll go into
why that is the case.

01:05:49.940 --> 01:05:51.740
But a typical material
in condensed matter

01:05:51.740 --> 01:05:54.500
where obviously this
was done was silicon.

01:05:54.500 --> 01:05:57.320
Silicon is a low coordinated
solid-- only fourfold

01:05:57.320 --> 01:05:59.390
coordinated in the
diamond cubic structure.

01:05:59.390 --> 01:06:01.830
It's extremely hard to get
that with a pair potential

01:06:01.830 --> 01:06:06.860
because again, your systems
always try to form FCC or HGP,

01:06:06.860 --> 01:06:09.000
essentially.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:13.550
So what you can do is build
a three-body potential

01:06:13.550 --> 01:06:18.240
that favors these 190-degree
tetrahedral angles.

01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:20.480
And as soon as you do
that, if you actually

01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:22.520
make that force
strong enough, you

01:06:22.520 --> 01:06:25.813
can do almost nothing else
than form diamond cubic.

01:06:25.813 --> 01:06:27.230
Because diamond
cubic is basically

01:06:27.230 --> 01:06:31.745
the way to pack atoms and put
them under all these 109--

01:06:31.745 --> 01:06:36.210
what is it-- .4 or
something degree angles.

01:06:36.210 --> 01:06:38.780
So if you make a strong
enough three-body force,

01:06:38.780 --> 01:06:45.740
you will by definition end up
in the diamond cubic structure.

01:06:45.740 --> 01:06:49.190
If you work with
three coordinates,

01:06:49.190 --> 01:06:51.290
you can also transform
that and instead

01:06:51.290 --> 01:06:54.500
work with two
distances and an angle.

01:06:54.500 --> 01:06:57.600
So if I have three atoms,
the coordinates of them,

01:06:57.600 --> 01:07:00.800
I can also always say that to
have the relation between them,

01:07:00.800 --> 01:07:03.890
I just need to have these two
distances and this angle that

01:07:03.890 --> 01:07:06.560
fully defines the
three-body problem.

01:07:06.560 --> 01:07:08.600
And that's usually
how it's done.

01:07:08.600 --> 01:07:12.020
People have pair potentials
that take care of the distance

01:07:12.020 --> 01:07:13.500
dependence of that.

01:07:13.500 --> 01:07:15.740
And then they have
an angular potential

01:07:15.740 --> 01:07:17.960
which takes care of the
angle between these.

01:07:17.960 --> 01:07:20.300
And often, the prefactor
of the angular potential

01:07:20.300 --> 01:07:22.610
will have some
distance depends in it.

01:07:22.610 --> 01:07:24.380
Because of course,
maybe you want

01:07:24.380 --> 01:07:26.810
to enforce this
190-degree angle when

01:07:26.810 --> 01:07:28.700
your two other atoms are close.

01:07:28.700 --> 01:07:32.300
But when they're very far,
you don't really care anymore.

01:07:32.300 --> 01:07:35.720
What's the possible choices
for angular potentials?

01:07:35.720 --> 01:07:40.700
The simplest one is simply a
quadratic-- a harmonic function

01:07:40.700 --> 01:07:42.650
in the angle.

01:07:42.650 --> 01:07:45.710
If you want to impose
an angle theta naught,

01:07:45.710 --> 01:07:50.970
you make a potential
that's literally

01:07:50.970 --> 01:07:54.140
a quadratic around theta naught.

01:07:54.140 --> 01:07:57.450
So, extremely
simple to evaluate.

01:07:57.450 --> 01:08:00.150
So that function's
actually often used.

01:08:00.150 --> 01:08:01.940
You can also use--

01:08:01.940 --> 01:08:06.120
the disadvantage of this one
is that it's not periodic.

01:08:06.120 --> 01:08:08.145
Angle measurements
should be periodic.

01:08:08.145 --> 01:08:10.020
So you can kind of get
into trouble with this

01:08:10.020 --> 01:08:11.980
if you go too far
from equilibrium.

01:08:11.980 --> 01:08:14.940
So another thing you can use
is a cosine function which

01:08:14.940 --> 01:08:16.950
has the proper periodicity.

01:08:16.950 --> 01:08:18.540
If you take--

01:08:18.540 --> 01:08:19.560
I don't know--

01:08:19.560 --> 01:08:22.890
109 degrees or whatever
angle you want, or you

01:08:22.890 --> 01:08:24.470
take its complement--

01:08:24.470 --> 01:08:28.359
360 minus that-- you
should get the same answer.

01:08:28.359 --> 01:08:31.380
And so, cosine functions
will do that right.

01:08:31.380 --> 01:08:34.890
And this one, cosine
theta plus 1/3, this part

01:08:34.890 --> 01:08:41.628
is minimal when theta is
109 with tetrahedral angle.

01:08:41.628 --> 01:08:43.439
[CLEARS THROAT] Excuse me.

01:08:43.439 --> 01:08:44.760
Losing my voice.

01:08:44.760 --> 01:08:47.370
So it works working with
three-body potentials.

01:08:47.370 --> 01:08:49.300
It's, of course, more work.

01:08:49.300 --> 01:08:51.930
It's not [? order ?] N cubed.

01:08:51.930 --> 01:08:54.810
Because, for every
atom, you now have

01:08:54.810 --> 01:08:58.500
to look at distance and
angles with pairs of atoms.

01:08:58.500 --> 01:09:02.370
OK so it becomes an N cubed
operation, so it's more work.

01:09:02.370 --> 01:09:05.760
And calculating the forces as
the derivatives of the energy

01:09:05.760 --> 01:09:07.450
is also quite a bit more work.

01:09:17.710 --> 01:09:20.800
The most famous three-body
potential is probably

01:09:20.800 --> 01:09:24.609
the Stillinger Webber potential
which, as you can see,

01:09:24.609 --> 01:09:27.189
has this cosine
theta form for the--

01:09:27.189 --> 01:09:30.130
this is the angular part.

01:09:30.130 --> 01:09:34.029
This is the distance
dependence of the angular part.

01:09:34.029 --> 01:09:38.529
So how much should you penalize
angular deviations [INAUDIBLE]..

01:09:38.529 --> 01:09:40.500
And then this is
the two-body part.

01:09:40.500 --> 01:09:44.500
Just sort of a more
[? slight ?] potential.

01:09:44.500 --> 01:09:48.042
Originally, Stillinger
Webber, when they actually

01:09:48.042 --> 01:09:49.750
wrote down the function,
they didn't even

01:09:49.750 --> 01:09:52.069
fit it very carefully.

01:09:52.069 --> 01:09:55.150
I mean, it was a great form,
but they just kind of did

01:09:55.150 --> 01:09:56.260
a rough fit.

01:09:56.260 --> 01:09:58.510
And so, the original
Stillinger Webber parameters

01:09:58.510 --> 01:10:00.738
and the ones people now
use sometimes more recently

01:10:00.738 --> 01:10:01.780
are not the same anymore.

01:10:01.780 --> 01:10:03.190
The potential has the same form.

01:10:03.190 --> 01:10:05.650
But some people have done
recently better fits.

01:10:05.650 --> 01:10:09.220
So when somebody says that
Stillinger Webber potential,

01:10:09.220 --> 01:10:11.740
there are variations of
it for the constants.

01:10:19.700 --> 01:10:23.110
So what do you get
right with a [? sale ?]

01:10:23.110 --> 01:10:27.190
something like a Stillinger
Webber potential?

01:10:27.190 --> 01:10:30.070
Well, you can kind of
guess why people did this.

01:10:30.070 --> 01:10:31.620
Because silicon is
so important, they

01:10:31.620 --> 01:10:33.120
wanted to be able to
model silicon right.

01:10:33.120 --> 01:10:35.770
So it's important to understand
which pieces you get right.

01:10:38.770 --> 01:10:42.910
One of the critical issues
was surface reconstruction.

01:10:42.910 --> 01:10:44.836
If you take silicon 111--

01:10:44.836 --> 01:10:47.650
sorry, 100.

01:10:47.650 --> 01:10:51.400
If you truncate it,
it actually undergoes

01:10:51.400 --> 01:10:53.530
a 2 times 1 reconstruction.

01:10:53.530 --> 01:11:00.170
What essentially happens if
you take this top layer atoms,

01:11:00.170 --> 01:11:03.550
they're only bonded to
two atoms below them,

01:11:03.550 --> 01:11:06.070
and so they dimerize
on the surface.

01:11:06.070 --> 01:11:08.860
So basically,
these move together

01:11:08.860 --> 01:11:11.570
in sort of double rows.

01:11:11.570 --> 01:11:13.590
I need a better color.

01:11:13.590 --> 01:11:16.560
And then these
will move together.

01:11:16.560 --> 01:11:19.950
And so they double the
periodicity in one direction.

01:11:19.950 --> 01:11:22.040
And so you have these
dimers that form.

01:11:22.040 --> 01:11:24.080
And because of that,
the surface atom

01:11:24.080 --> 01:11:26.510
is bonded to three other atoms--

01:11:26.510 --> 01:11:29.622
two below it, one all
the way in the surface.

01:11:29.622 --> 01:11:30.830
And so they're better bonded.

01:11:30.830 --> 01:11:33.290
And that's the 2 by
1 reconstruction.

01:11:33.290 --> 01:11:36.290
The 2 by 1 reconstruction you
get right with the Stillinger

01:11:36.290 --> 01:11:37.370
Webber potential.

01:11:37.370 --> 01:11:39.860
You'd actually get it
right with almost anything.

01:11:39.860 --> 01:11:43.370
It's essentially a
topological reconstruction.

01:11:43.370 --> 01:11:47.030
You know, atoms like to have
more atoms around them to bond,

01:11:47.030 --> 01:11:48.110
period.

01:11:48.110 --> 01:11:51.560
And so that's what drives
a 2 by 1 reconstruction.

01:11:51.560 --> 01:11:55.970
At the top layer, atoms now are
at least threefold coordinated

01:11:55.970 --> 01:11:59.960
and they're actually almost
fourfold coordinated instead

01:11:59.960 --> 01:12:04.350
of twofold coordinated at just
an unreconstructed terminated

01:12:04.350 --> 01:12:04.850
surface.

01:12:14.310 --> 01:12:18.270
But here's the reconstruction
on the 111 surface.

01:12:18.270 --> 01:12:22.500
The reconstruction on the
111 surface is 7 by 7.

01:12:22.500 --> 01:12:27.480
So it forms a much larger
unit cell on the surface.

01:12:27.480 --> 01:12:30.090
And that is not reproduced
by the Stillinger Webber

01:12:30.090 --> 01:12:30.780
potential.

01:12:30.780 --> 01:12:32.870
So clearly, that's a
more subtle effect.

01:12:42.300 --> 01:12:45.480
Silicon, being such
an important material,

01:12:45.480 --> 01:12:48.870
has a multitude of potentials.

01:12:48.870 --> 01:12:52.140
Everybody sort of has
made one and claims

01:12:52.140 --> 01:12:55.080
theirs is better than yours.

01:12:55.080 --> 01:12:57.940
And I just show this
graph not for the details,

01:12:57.940 --> 01:13:02.520
but to show you that
this isn't even a tenth

01:13:02.520 --> 01:13:03.990
of the potentials
made for silicon,

01:13:03.990 --> 01:13:05.230
but some of the famous ones.

01:13:05.230 --> 01:13:07.530
SW-- Stillinger Webber--

01:13:07.530 --> 01:13:10.450
[? bismuth, ?] [? Harman, ?]
and the Tersoff potentials,

01:13:10.450 --> 01:13:12.970
which are quite famous for
silicon, are not even on here.

01:13:12.970 --> 01:13:17.070
But if you see, this
is the angular part

01:13:17.070 --> 01:13:18.060
of these potentials.

01:13:18.060 --> 01:13:20.760
It's very different.

01:13:20.760 --> 01:13:25.470
They all give the same answer,
unlike static properties

01:13:25.470 --> 01:13:28.660
like the elastic properties of
silicon, the cohesive energy,

01:13:28.660 --> 01:13:30.420
the lattice parameter.

01:13:30.420 --> 01:13:33.720
But it's sort of divided
differently between pair parts

01:13:33.720 --> 01:13:34.590
and angular parts.

01:13:37.230 --> 01:13:39.030
This one clearly
wouldn't give you

01:13:39.030 --> 01:13:42.570
the same stiffness
of bond bending

01:13:42.570 --> 01:13:45.750
around the typical
dihedral angle.

01:13:45.750 --> 01:13:46.920
And that shows up.

01:13:46.920 --> 01:13:50.680
There's what I thought
was a really nice paper.

01:13:50.680 --> 01:13:51.990
Oh, and I'm sorry, I-- oh, no.

01:13:51.990 --> 01:13:52.820
The reference [? isn't ?] here.

01:13:52.820 --> 01:13:54.945
This is the [? Norman ?]
[? and ?] [? paper ?] from

01:13:54.945 --> 01:13:59.280
Physical Review B. They did
what I thought was brilliant.

01:13:59.280 --> 01:14:01.320
They did exactly
the same simulation

01:14:01.320 --> 01:14:04.140
with three different potentials.

01:14:04.140 --> 01:14:06.210
Left is the Stillinger
Webber potential,

01:14:06.210 --> 01:14:09.510
and then middle column is
Tersoff [? 2. ?] This is

01:14:09.510 --> 01:14:12.120
the Tersoff potential, and then
Tersoff [? 3. ?] So this is

01:14:12.120 --> 01:14:15.240
exactly the same Monte Carlo
simulation with the three

01:14:15.240 --> 01:14:16.210
potentials.

01:14:16.210 --> 01:14:20.310
And this is the [? 001 ?] or
[? 100 ?] surface of silicon.

01:14:20.310 --> 01:14:24.450
So remember, that's the one
I showed you that dimerizes.

01:14:24.450 --> 01:14:28.443
And so the top line
is at low temperature.

01:14:32.070 --> 01:14:35.560
Tersoff [? 3 ?]
doesn't dimerize.

01:14:35.560 --> 01:14:38.760
Tersoff 2 does sort of dimerize.

01:14:38.760 --> 01:14:40.410
And so does Stillinger
Webber, but they

01:14:40.410 --> 01:14:41.410
look slightly different.

01:14:41.410 --> 01:14:42.993
But these are in
reasonable agreement.

01:14:42.993 --> 01:14:48.180
If you go higher in temperature,
then Tersoff [? 3 ?] dimerizes.

01:14:48.180 --> 01:14:49.710
So does the Stillinger Webber.

01:14:49.710 --> 01:14:53.580
But Tersoff [? 2 ?] starts
kind of looking quite different

01:14:53.580 --> 01:14:54.420
already.

01:14:54.420 --> 01:14:55.920
So these are
potentials that, if you

01:14:55.920 --> 01:14:59.790
looked at how they
reproduce static properties,

01:14:59.790 --> 01:15:03.000
they all do extremely well.

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:06.390
But it's extremely hard to
fit to dynamical properties

01:15:06.390 --> 01:15:09.480
because you don't have that
as quantitative information

01:15:09.480 --> 01:15:10.770
very often.

01:15:10.770 --> 01:15:14.130
Like, first of
all, we don't know

01:15:14.130 --> 01:15:16.830
what the right answer is here.

01:15:16.830 --> 01:15:21.720
But even if we did, let's say,
somebody does brilliant STM

01:15:21.720 --> 01:15:24.540
and we know the right answer,
it's very hard to feed

01:15:24.540 --> 01:15:27.280
that back into a potential.

01:15:27.280 --> 01:15:29.010
And so the reason
I'm telling you

01:15:29.010 --> 01:15:31.980
this is not to dissuade
you from using [INAUDIBLE]

01:15:31.980 --> 01:15:32.850
when you need them.

01:15:32.850 --> 01:15:35.865
It's just to make
sure you're cautious.

01:15:39.300 --> 01:15:42.450
There's a big reason that
people do ab initio calculations

01:15:42.450 --> 01:15:43.650
these days.

01:15:43.650 --> 01:15:46.270
It's not because they
necessarily like it,

01:15:46.270 --> 01:15:47.760
but it's because
the results tend

01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:51.090
to be more reliable, or
at least predictable.

01:15:51.090 --> 01:15:53.370
The errors are more
predictable, let's put it

01:15:53.370 --> 01:15:56.430
that way, which is a
useful thing to have.

01:15:56.430 --> 01:15:57.720
Having error is one thing.

01:15:57.720 --> 01:16:01.320
Having unpredictable
error is a lot worse.

01:16:01.320 --> 01:16:05.130
But still, there will always
be problems where they're just

01:16:05.130 --> 01:16:07.770
too complex, or you want
to do them fast where you

01:16:07.770 --> 01:16:09.630
want to use pair potentials.

01:16:09.630 --> 01:16:11.970
Just don't always believe
everything you see.

01:16:14.856 --> 01:16:17.280
Try to fit as close
to where you're

01:16:17.280 --> 01:16:19.770
going to explore the
physics that's essentially

01:16:19.770 --> 01:16:25.680
[? meaning. ?]

01:16:25.680 --> 01:16:27.820
OK, here's a bunch
of references.

01:16:27.820 --> 01:16:30.960
I'll actually put these
on the Stellar website.

01:16:30.960 --> 01:16:36.390
We'll finish the empirical
potential lecture.

01:16:36.390 --> 01:16:38.460
We'll go into organics
and a little bit

01:16:38.460 --> 01:16:41.058
of polymers on Tuesday.

01:16:41.058 --> 01:16:42.600
And then Professor
[? Marzari ?] will

01:16:42.600 --> 01:16:46.080
start giving you introduction
to basic quantum mechanics.

01:16:46.080 --> 01:16:49.512
And then we'll start sort
of ab initio energy methods,

01:16:49.512 --> 01:16:51.220
and Professor
[? Marzari ?] will do that.

01:16:51.220 --> 01:16:53.140
So I'll be still
lecturing on Tuesday.

01:16:53.140 --> 01:16:57.170
So have a good weekend, and
I'll see you on Tuesday.

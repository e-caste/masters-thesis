FRANK SCHILBACH: Welcome to
the mid-term review of 14.13.

00:00:13.348 --> 00:00:14.890
Tonight, as I
mentioned before, there

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:18.500
will be three types of
questions on the exam.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.050
There will be
true/false/uncertain questions.

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:23.800
These are questions where
you're given a statement,

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.440
and you can ascertain
whether the statement is

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.460
true or false or uncertain.

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.250
True means essentially
it's strictly true

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:32.840
and it's always true, or false
means it's strictly false,

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.250
and there's a counterexample
that's shows you it's false.

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:41.300
And uncertain means like without
having further information,

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.220
you cannot actually
answer the questions.

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.640
So you cannot really make
a statement whether that

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.610
statement is true or false.

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:52.480
In any of the ones you
do, please always explain

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.040
your answers carefully.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.685
So just writing true,
false, or uncertain

00:00:56.685 --> 00:00:59.110
will almost surely
or will surely not

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:00.670
give you full credit.

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:02.830
You have to explain
your answers.

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:06.450
It doesn't actually matter that
much whether you get it right,

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.950
whether the statement is
true, or false, or uncertain,

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.202
as long as your answer is
actually reasonable and shows

00:01:13.202 --> 00:01:14.660
some understanding
of the material.

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.260
So the quality of your
answer is quite important.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.290
We also want you to
provide intuitions.

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.340
We do not want you to just write
some math and nothing else.

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.120
You can use some math
to sort of clarify

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.460
your answer or the
like, but you always

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.610
need to provide a verbal
explanation and some intuition

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.970
and some explanation of why
you think the answer might be

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:42.830
or the statement
might be true, false,

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:45.478
or [AUDIO OUT] your answer.

00:01:45.478 --> 00:01:47.520
For multiple choice
questions, you're essentially

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.650
given different
choices, and you just

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:51.810
pick one answer with no
further explanation needed.

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.105
Very simple.

00:01:53.105 --> 00:01:55.230
And then there will be sort
of pset-style questions

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:58.120
that sort of you're familiar
with, either from like psets

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.080
or like previous exams.

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.250
These will be quite similar
to the psets questions.

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.480
It will be sort of generally
not on the harder side,

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.740
just, you know, we only have
so much time to do this.

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:10.530
There will be some
algebra involved.

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:16.900
Again, please always explain
your answers carefully.

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.650
Now, what materials are
you responsible for?

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.380
You're responsible for the
lectures up to and including

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.710
lecture 12, which was
the lecture on March 11,

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:30.985
up to slide 67 of
lectures 11, or lecture--

00:02:30.985 --> 00:02:34.120
the notes for the lecture,
the handout of the notes for

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.930
lectures 11 through 13.

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.340
You're also responsible for
recitations 1 through 5,

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:44.680
recitations 6, now, which the
recitation that Will gave,

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.200
which is quite similar
to this one, and 7.

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.120
These recitations
are just reviews

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.460
that might be helpful
for some of you.

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:54.090
But there's no new material
that we use that [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.590
right now.

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:00.070
Psets 1 to 3 are sort
of part of the deal.

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:04.120
And readings, starred
or non-starred readings

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.300
cited in class are only
relevant to the extent

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:11.000
that they appear in
lectures and/or recitation.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.810
But to say, like if I discuss
a certain paper and the content

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.060
of that paper, the content
of the people that's

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.750
discussed in the class
is relevant to you.

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.230
However, anything
that's in the paper that

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.170
doesn't appear in the
lecture is not relevant,

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.570
as in like, we're not going
to ask you questions that

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:31.510
sort of ask about some
obscure details of the papers

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.110
that you never heard
about in class.

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:36.600
How do you get
ready for the exam?

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:41.050
Well, you study, study that the
lecture and presentation slides

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:42.580
carefully.

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:45.880
You should make sure you're
familiar and comfortable

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.190
with the psets and
the solutions make

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:51.730
you understand and are able to
solve the psets on your own.

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:56.650
A great resource practice is
to do those psets and exams.

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:01.558
Again, readings, starred and
non-starred, are not required,

00:04:01.558 --> 00:04:03.850
but they may sort of help
you deepen your understanding

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:05.850
of the material, and maybe
sometimes the lecture

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:07.560
notes a little bit.

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.090
[AUDIO OUT] dense and don't
have that much detail.

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:12.400
So you can sort of like try
to consult them, and try

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.380
to understand the material
as best or better.

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:21.208
But we won't ask you about
the details of those readings

00:04:21.208 --> 00:04:25.246
beyond those details of
was covered in class.

00:04:25.246 --> 00:04:27.735
So let me now sort of review
the material overall and sort

00:04:27.735 --> 00:04:29.860
of give you a sense of what
are the kinds of things

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.180
that we want to know.

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:33.250
To be clear, this
is not exhaustive

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:36.135
in the sense of like, there
are some other materials

00:04:36.135 --> 00:04:38.260
in the lecture slides that
I'm not mentioning here.

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:39.460
What I'm trying
to do here is just

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:40.877
give you a sense
for a lot of what

00:04:40.877 --> 00:04:43.970
the most important key
things that you should know.

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:45.905
This will cover
perhaps like 80%,

00:04:45.905 --> 00:04:47.920
90% of the material
that's actually

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.570
potentially in the exam.

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:52.570
Having said that, you
know you should really

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:54.130
go through the entire
lecture slides,

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:56.200
make sure you're sort
of gathering everything

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.650
in understanding
what's going on there.

00:04:58.650 --> 00:04:59.370
OK.

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:02.460
So the first thing we discuss,
these time preferences

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:05.623
in particular, the
exponential discounting model.

00:05:05.623 --> 00:05:08.040
Here, you should know, what
is the exponential discounting

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.820
model?

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:11.010
What is delta, the time
preference parameter

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:12.000
that model?

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.210
What does it measure?

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:15.900
How can we estimate it, assuming
that an exponential discounting

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.090
model is correct?

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:20.100
Further, what are
the main assumptions

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:23.760
of exponential
discounting model,

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:26.430
and what evidence do we have
against those assumptions?

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:30.270
So lectures 3 and 4
discussed those assumptions

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:35.220
and the evidence against
these assumptions in detail.

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:38.280
And after that, we discussed
the quasi-hyperbolic discounting

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:41.340
model, which is a relatively
small modification

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:43.440
of the exponential
discounting model.

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.390
Again, you know
what is this model?

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:48.220
How is it different from the
exponential discounting model?

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:50.160
And of course, the
difference is that there's

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.460
a present bias
parameter of beta that

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:59.940
is added to this model, which
measures short-run discounting,

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:02.310
as in like, how much weight
you put on the present,

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:04.920
versus everything else
that's in the future.

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:10.080
Now, what empirical evidence
can the quasi-exponential,

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:13.020
quasi-hyperbolic
model explain better

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:15.577
than the exponential discounting
model, and why is that?

00:06:15.577 --> 00:06:17.410
So you should be familiar
with, for example,

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:19.618
things like preference
reversals and then [INAUDIBLE]

00:06:19.618 --> 00:06:20.220
commitment.

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:23.040
Why is that consistent with
the quasi-hyperbolic model?

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:25.275
And you know, why
is it not consistent

00:06:25.275 --> 00:06:26.400
with the exponential model?

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:27.375
Of course, that's
what we discussed

00:06:27.375 --> 00:06:29.760
in the previous slide, is
the somewhat the assumptions

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:33.360
of the exponential discount
model, where for example, one

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:35.980
of the key assumptions are
that there are no preference

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:36.480
reversals.

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:39.770
And we discussed that in detail.

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:42.770
Then, of course you need
to know in the course

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:46.370
of hyperbolic discounting model,
what is this sophistication?

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:47.360
What is naivete?

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.610
And what is partial naivete?

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:51.200
So what does theta measure?

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:52.730
What does theta hat measure?

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:54.560
What is full sophistication,
full naivete,

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:56.470
and partial naivete?

00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:58.700
And answer questions
such as like,

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:01.520
does sophistication make
people always better off?

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:05.210
And why, or why not,
if that's the case?

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:09.290
Further, you should understand,
what is demand for commitment?

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:11.270
Who demands commitment
and who doesn't?

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:13.700
Or like are fully
sophisticated or fully naive

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:17.610
people, or partial naive
people potentially demanding

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:18.110
commitment?

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:20.000
What are the
conditions under which

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.790
somebody demands commitment?

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:29.000
And what kinds of people do
not, or do demand commitment?

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.030
And what kinds of people
benefit from doing so?

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:34.880
And in particular, can
people be worse off

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:36.995
from being offered
a commitment device?

00:07:36.995 --> 00:07:40.650
And why is that, or why not?

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:42.180
Next, we discussed
in quite a bit

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:44.700
of detail empirical
applications from a range

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:46.570
of different settings.

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:48.930
This is lecture 5 and 6.

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:51.120
So we want you to
be familiar with

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:55.437
those empirical applications.

00:07:55.437 --> 00:07:57.770
You should understand why the
quasi-hyperbolic model can

00:07:57.770 --> 00:08:02.453
explain or cannot explain
some of the empirical evidence

00:08:02.453 --> 00:08:04.370
better than the exponential
discounting model.

00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:09.890
And I think you know , kind
of like why do we think

00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:13.670
quasi-hyperbolic model is a good
fit for some of the empirical

00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:17.290
examples that I have shown?

00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:20.200
Then you need to be
able to solve problems.

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:22.800
These are similar problems to
the problems in the problem

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:25.400
sets that you have seen
before, problem sets

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:28.310
for people either like
exponential discounters,

00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:33.799
or like for beta delta
equals, where beta equals 1,

00:08:33.799 --> 00:08:35.870
and delta being like
either 1, or 0.95,

00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:39.394
or close to 1, because
hyperbolic discounters,

00:08:39.394 --> 00:08:42.455
and again, fully naive, fully
sophisticated, and partially

00:08:42.455 --> 00:08:43.490
naive agents.

00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:45.000
How does one solve
such problems?

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.760
Of course, we had
plenty of practice

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:49.970
already in the psets
in the term examples,

00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:51.800
also it's in the finals.

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:58.490
So you should use
backwards or forwards

00:08:58.490 --> 00:09:02.660
induction or iteration,
depending on the kinks.

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:06.560
I sort of discuss this in
slide 62 of lectures 3 and 4,

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:09.500
and slide 37 of
lectures 5 and 6.

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:12.320
There's also a recitation
that covers that in detail.

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:17.260
So you should have plenty
of practice of doing so.

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:19.630
Now, let me now give
you some examples

00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:22.840
of what are some examples
true/false/uncertain questions,

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:24.790
and how should you answer them?

00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:26.950
So let me sort of just read
the statements for you,

00:09:26.950 --> 00:09:28.700
and you can think about
this for a second.

00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:31.240
And then we're going
to give you the answer.

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:34.540
So consider individuals with
beta delta preferences--

00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:37.300
this is quasi-hyperbolic
discounters--

00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:40.510
who only differ by
their present bias--

00:09:40.510 --> 00:09:46.260
had like beta equals
between 0 and 1.

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:49.110
And suppose there's a commitment
savings device available.

00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:51.300
Their willingness to pay
for this commitment device

00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:55.270
strictly decreases in beta.

00:09:55.270 --> 00:09:59.530
Now, is that a true
or false statement?

00:09:59.530 --> 00:10:04.330
The answer is this
statement is false.

00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:05.490
Now, why is that?

00:10:05.490 --> 00:10:08.220
Well, there's, again, like
if you just click false,

00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:10.080
that's not going to
give you full credit,

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:13.577
even if, in fact, the
statement is false.

00:10:13.577 --> 00:10:15.660
What you need to do is you
need to sort of provide

00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:19.140
some further explanation.

00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:22.110
Ideally, you'll provide us
like a somewhat detailed

00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:26.250
explanation, so that
you know if it's false,

00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:28.620
if you provide several
examples, that's should better

00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:30.540
amount than just one.

00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:32.640
In this case, why is it false?

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:35.050
Well, A, individuals
might be naive, right?

00:10:35.050 --> 00:10:37.620
So in particular, if
people are fully naive,

00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:40.380
they will not be
willing to pay anything

00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:41.920
for commitment devices.

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:44.740
So regardless to the
beta, willingness to pay

00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:46.140
will always be 0.

00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:49.520
So it would surely
not decrease in beta.

00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:52.100
Second, the commitment
device may just not

00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:53.160
be effective at all.

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:55.520
If the commitment
device is useless,

00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:58.940
it doesn't matter what beta is,
nobody will demand commitment

00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:00.290
anyway.

00:11:00.290 --> 00:11:02.330
And finally, even if
individuals-- this

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:04.130
is a little bit more
trickier explanation,

00:11:04.130 --> 00:11:05.750
and I wouldn't
necessarily expect

00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:08.510
you to know that
answer-- but even

00:11:08.510 --> 00:11:10.430
if individuals are
fully sophisticated

00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:13.400
and devices effective, the
commitment device is effective,

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:18.950
willingness to pay, it may not
be strictly decreasing in beta.

00:11:18.950 --> 00:11:20.540
And here's sort of an example.

00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:23.720
Well, if beta equals
0 or beta equals 1,

00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:26.030
then individuals would
be willing to pay 0

00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:27.590
for the commitment
device, right?

00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:30.500
Because if beta equals 0, they
don't care about the future.

00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:31.980
If beta equals 1,
they just don't

00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:34.250
need any commitment devices.

00:11:34.250 --> 00:11:37.100
But in between, the
willingness to pay

00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:40.640
might be positive for
betas between 0 and 1.

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:43.730
That essentially means
that willingness to pay

00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:46.250
would be an inverse U in beta.

00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:47.990
Again, that's a bit
of a tricky answer.

00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:50.750
Like the third bullet point,
we wouldn't necessarily

00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:53.390
expect you to know that answer.

00:11:53.390 --> 00:11:58.580
But you should be able to say or
to answer reason one, or reason

00:11:58.580 --> 00:12:02.380
two in this specific case.

00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:05.740
Second example statement--
fully sophisticated

00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:09.100
individuals can experience
large welfare losses

00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:10.400
from their present bias.

00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:14.970
The answer is this is true.

00:12:14.970 --> 00:12:15.738
Why is that?

00:12:15.738 --> 00:12:17.530
I'll let you think
about this for a second.

00:12:29.170 --> 00:12:31.840
Well, the answer
is that awareness

00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:33.850
of present bias, that
is, like sophistication,

00:12:33.850 --> 00:12:36.160
does not remove present bias.

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:39.860
Even if people
are sophisticated,

00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:41.650
the present bias is still there.

00:12:41.650 --> 00:12:43.690
There might be some
commitment devices,

00:12:43.690 --> 00:12:48.850
some ways in which people are
able to overcome the losses

00:12:48.850 --> 00:12:50.930
associated with present bias.

00:12:50.930 --> 00:12:54.100
But in the absence of
commitment devices,

00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:56.080
people may still make
suboptimal decisions.

00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:58.660
And some of these
decisions might, in fact,

00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:00.490
induce large welfare needs.

00:13:00.490 --> 00:13:02.970
We discussed some
examples in class,

00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:04.640
sort of numerical
examples, where

00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:07.450
you could see that sophisticated
people might actually

00:13:07.450 --> 00:13:11.170
be worse off than naive
people, and could in fact

00:13:11.170 --> 00:13:14.210
suffer quite a bit from or
similar to the large welfare

00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:14.710
losses.

00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:16.600
With the present
bias, all of this

00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:19.360
is evaluated by the
long-run [INAUDIBLE] ideas

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:24.730
of like if somebody makes
choices for the future where

00:13:24.730 --> 00:13:27.770
the beta is not
relevant, compared

00:13:27.770 --> 00:13:30.150
to that kind of
welfare criterion,

00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:34.650
people might be a lot worse
off due to their present bias.

00:13:34.650 --> 00:13:36.820
OK, here's example number three.

00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:39.640
Present bias individuals
always have positive demand

00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:42.320
for commitment devices.

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:45.960
Again, the statement is false.

00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:46.550
Why is that?

00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:48.200
And we kind of
discussed this already

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:50.055
in the previous questions.

00:13:50.055 --> 00:13:51.425
Now, let me be very explicit.

00:13:51.425 --> 00:13:53.180
There's sort of
three conditions that

00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:55.470
must be met for positive
demand for commitment.

00:13:55.470 --> 00:13:57.610
I discussed this in class.

00:13:57.610 --> 00:13:59.570
We know that person
must be present biased,

00:13:59.570 --> 00:14:02.533
or have some form of some
self-control problems.

00:14:02.533 --> 00:14:03.950
Individuals must--
the person must

00:14:03.950 --> 00:14:07.170
be aware of the present bias,
so they can't be fully naive.

00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:10.370
They could be partially naive,
but it can't be fully naive.

00:14:10.370 --> 00:14:12.725
And the individual must
perceive the commitment device

00:14:12.725 --> 00:14:16.293
as effective in helping overcome
the self-control problem.

00:14:16.293 --> 00:14:18.710
That's to say, if somebody is
offered a commitment device,

00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:20.660
and that commitment
device is useless,

00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:23.570
well, there's not going to
be any demand for commitment,

00:14:23.570 --> 00:14:26.240
particularly if the person
perceives that the commitment

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:28.887
device is useless.

00:14:28.887 --> 00:14:30.470
Notice that that
person might actually

00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:32.590
perceive the commitment
device to be effective,

00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:33.938
while in reality, it's not.

00:14:33.938 --> 00:14:36.230
So they might have some
positive demand for commitment,

00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:38.930
even if the commitment
device is in reality useless,

00:14:38.930 --> 00:14:41.360
because their beliefs are
wrong, because of essentially

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:44.690
some form of partial naivete.

00:14:44.690 --> 00:14:47.570
But it cannot be that the person
perceives the commitment device

00:14:47.570 --> 00:14:50.120
as not effective, because
then the person would just not

00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:52.110
demand it in the first place.

00:14:52.110 --> 00:14:54.920
Now, that makes now
the statement false.

00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:57.170
When only the first condition
of the three is met,

00:14:57.170 --> 00:15:00.050
as in like the person's
only present-biased,

00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:03.500
then we cannot be sure that
there will be positive demand

00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:06.740
for commitment.

00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:09.860
And so the statement,
as had been said,

00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:13.040
is false, because we said
sort of like always have

00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:14.840
positive demand for commitment.

00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:16.990
If it were without
the always, then

00:15:16.990 --> 00:15:19.590
you could also answer uncertain,
because then you would say,

00:15:19.590 --> 00:15:22.160
well, it depends
on their naivete,

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:26.390
or on the sophistication, or
it depends on how effective

00:15:26.390 --> 00:15:27.830
the commitment device is.

00:15:27.830 --> 00:15:30.830
But the way the statement is
written, it says like, always.

00:15:30.830 --> 00:15:32.360
And so now, you
can easily come up

00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:36.170
with some counterexamples that
show that the statement in fact

00:15:36.170 --> 00:15:36.850
is false.

00:15:39.790 --> 00:15:41.740
The second topic
that we discussed

00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:44.780
after time preferences
was risk preferences,

00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:47.180
in particular expected utility.

00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:49.952
So here, you know,
you need to have

00:15:49.952 --> 00:15:53.520
a clear understanding of what
is the expected utility model?

00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:54.750
What is risk aversion?

00:15:54.750 --> 00:15:56.760
Why are people risk averse?

00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:58.980
How is risk aversion
specifically modeled

00:15:58.980 --> 00:16:01.290
in the expected utility model?

00:16:01.290 --> 00:16:04.840
What is the expected
monetary value?

00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:08.040
And also things like
what is concavity?

00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:09.720
What does concavity
have to do-- what

00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:13.170
is the expected utility versus
the expected monetary value?

00:16:13.170 --> 00:16:17.220
And what does the concavity
imply for risk aversion

00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:20.510
in the expected utility model?

00:16:20.510 --> 00:16:23.030
Then next, how can we
measure risk aversion

00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:25.110
within the expected
utility model?

00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:27.110
In particular, we
discussed three types

00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:29.040
of ways of measuring
risk aversion.

00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:30.620
We discuss certainty
equivalents.

00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:32.840
We discussed choices
from gambles.

00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:35.570
We also discussed
insurance choices.

00:16:35.570 --> 00:16:38.250
This is the Sydnor paper.

00:16:38.250 --> 00:16:41.670
And then, we discussed what is
problematic about the estimates

00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:44.760
of risk aversion in the
expected utility model.

00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:46.650
In particular, we
discussed evidence

00:16:46.650 --> 00:16:50.360
that found that there tends to
be substantial small-scale risk

00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:53.075
aversion, so when you
give people small gambles,

00:16:53.075 --> 00:16:54.450
they tend to be
quite risk averse

00:16:54.450 --> 00:16:58.680
or they tend to have a
very quite high gamma.

00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:02.130
But we know also from large
scale choices that the risk

00:17:02.130 --> 00:17:06.569
aversion cannot be actually
that high when people make these

00:17:06.569 --> 00:17:07.349
choices.

00:17:07.349 --> 00:17:09.480
People leave the house
every day and engage

00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:11.760
in quite a few risks.

00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:14.250
In the long run, they
hold stocks and so on.

00:17:14.250 --> 00:17:17.430
This must mean
that their long run

00:17:17.430 --> 00:17:20.400
using sort of long-run choices,
that implies essentially

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:22.199
a relatively low gamma.

00:17:22.199 --> 00:17:25.140
But since the expected utility
model only has like one

00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:28.950
parameter, it cannot explain
both of those features and sort

00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:30.870
of ignores this trouble.

00:17:30.870 --> 00:17:35.250
So essentially, if you try
to match a small-scale risk

00:17:35.250 --> 00:17:38.650
aversion, then you need to have
a very large gamma, high gamma.

00:17:38.650 --> 00:17:40.590
If you try to match
large-scale risk aversion,

00:17:40.590 --> 00:17:42.030
you need to have a low gamma.

00:17:42.030 --> 00:17:45.030
And that sort of brings
trouble, because you can't just

00:17:45.030 --> 00:17:46.770
explain both of those things.

00:17:46.770 --> 00:17:49.440
And sort of Matthew
Rabin in Rabin & Thaler,

00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:53.940
as well as recitation 4 discuss
this conundrum and this issue

00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:58.370
and in quite a bit of detail.

00:17:58.370 --> 00:18:02.310
Next, we discussed Kahneman and
Tversky's 1979 prospect theory.

00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:04.260
This is a seminal paper.

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:08.100
And if you'd remember just a
few papers from this class,

00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:11.780
this is one of the papers that
you should really know about.

00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:13.450
So what evidence in
Kahneman and Tversky

00:18:13.450 --> 00:18:15.740
is inconsistent with
expected utility?

00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:18.050
Well, in particular, sort
of several things in there,

00:18:18.050 --> 00:18:19.910
but you discuss mostly
one feature, which

00:18:19.910 --> 00:18:22.130
is risk aversion
in the gain domain,

00:18:22.130 --> 00:18:27.480
and risk lovingness
in the loss domain.

00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:29.620
And so, now, what are
the most important points

00:18:29.620 --> 00:18:31.573
from Kahneman and
Tversky's prospect theory--

00:18:31.573 --> 00:18:33.240
this is sort of the
proposed alternative

00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:34.520
to expected utilities.

00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:39.203
This is on slide 3
of 51 of lecture 9,

00:18:39.203 --> 00:18:41.370
where there's sort of three
futures discussed there.

00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:45.000
One is like changes rather
than levels are the arguments

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:46.590
of the utility function.

00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:48.490
Then there's loss aversion.

00:18:48.490 --> 00:18:52.560
So there's a kink of the utility
function around the reference

00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:53.520
point.

00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:57.120
And there's diminishing
sensitivity,

00:18:57.120 --> 00:19:01.890
meaning the utility function
is concave in the gain domain

00:19:01.890 --> 00:19:05.568
or [INAUDIBLE] above the
reference point and is convex.

00:19:05.568 --> 00:19:07.860
And the last domain would be
below the reference point.

00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:14.830
OK, so now, what does sort
of this proposed alternative

00:19:14.830 --> 00:19:16.788
utility or value
function look like?

00:19:16.788 --> 00:19:18.830
How does it incorporate
the three features again?

00:19:18.830 --> 00:19:22.070
We sort of discussed this
and this utility function

00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:26.380
in lecture 9 that talks
about this in detail.

00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:29.273
Or the lecture talks about this
utility function in detail.

00:19:29.273 --> 00:19:31.690
One key question here, that
is, how is the reference point

00:19:31.690 --> 00:19:32.260
determined?

00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:34.490
What are some candidate
reference points?

00:19:34.490 --> 00:19:36.430
So one candidate would
be the status quo.

00:19:36.430 --> 00:19:39.658
Another reference point
candidate would be expectation.

00:19:39.658 --> 00:19:41.200
But there could be
also other things,

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:43.420
such as goal and aspirations.

00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:46.120
Recitation 5 discuss
this a little bit,

00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:49.650
not in too much detail.

00:19:49.650 --> 00:19:52.950
Then, we discussed empirical
evidence, in particular,

00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:55.560
what empirical evidence of
loss aversion do we have?

00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:57.610
We talked about
small-scale gambles.

00:19:57.610 --> 00:20:00.390
We talked about the endowment
effect, in particular.

00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:05.108
And then we discussed some
applications in lecture 9.

00:20:05.108 --> 00:20:06.400
So what are these applications?

00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:09.100
We discuss labor supply,
the housing market, stocks,

00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:11.010
marathon running, and golf.

00:20:11.010 --> 00:20:15.090
So you should be familiar with
these empirical applications

00:20:15.090 --> 00:20:16.350
from lecture 9.

00:20:16.350 --> 00:20:18.030
You should in
particular understand

00:20:18.030 --> 00:20:21.630
why reference-dependent
preferences can explain

00:20:21.630 --> 00:20:24.390
some of the empirical
evidence that

00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:26.680
is showed better than the
expected utility models.

00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:29.290
You should understand,
is some of the evidence

00:20:29.290 --> 00:20:31.770
that we see consistent with
the expected utility model?

00:20:31.770 --> 00:20:33.380
And if not, why not?

00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:35.700
And why is the
reference-dependent model--

00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:38.700
in particular, which feature of
the reference-dependent model

00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:39.600
can explain the loss.

00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:41.310
What are the features again?

00:20:41.310 --> 00:20:43.290
Changes rather than levels--

00:20:43.290 --> 00:20:46.200
some reference point,
reference-dependence, the loss

00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:49.195
aversion and
diminished sensitivity,

00:20:49.195 --> 00:20:50.820
so which feature is
actually important?

00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:54.450
Explaining things, we focused
mostly on loss aversion.

00:20:54.450 --> 00:20:58.470
What is not relevant is the
deal or no deal evidence

00:20:58.470 --> 00:21:00.027
and the paper by Pierce et al.

00:21:00.027 --> 00:21:02.110
There's a couple of slides
at the end of lecture 9

00:21:02.110 --> 00:21:04.560
that I didn't really cover
or didn't cover at all.

00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:08.915
So we're not going to ask
any questions about that.

00:21:08.915 --> 00:21:10.290
So now, how do
you solve problems

00:21:10.290 --> 00:21:11.832
with reference-dependent
preferences?

00:21:11.832 --> 00:21:14.940
You can see problem set
3, question number 1

00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:16.590
had some questions about this.

00:21:16.590 --> 00:21:19.282
And again, there's additional
psets and exam questions

00:21:19.282 --> 00:21:20.490
that you could practice with.

00:21:20.490 --> 00:21:24.140
So there are quite a few of
those kinds of questions.

00:21:24.140 --> 00:21:27.320
Now, here is sort of some
example of a multiple choice

00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:28.880
question, which is--

00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:32.210
so Maddie wrote this question,
so Maddie, in fact, appears.

00:21:32.210 --> 00:21:34.780
And the question is,
Maddie is writing

00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:36.890
a problem set for 14.13.

00:21:36.890 --> 00:21:40.440
She gets utility u of q from the
number of questions she writes.

00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:42.080
She has reference-dependent
preferences

00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:45.953
around the goal of writing
10 questions, with 10

00:21:45.953 --> 00:21:47.870
as her reference points.

00:21:47.870 --> 00:21:51.500
If you normalize the utility
of 10 questions to 0,

00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:55.345
which of the following would be
consistent with loss aversion?

00:21:55.345 --> 00:21:56.720
I'll let you have
a look at this.

00:21:56.720 --> 00:22:00.770
So there's option A, u of
of 8 equals minus 2, u of 12

00:22:00.770 --> 00:22:02.660
equals 1.

00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:06.560
And number B, option B yields
8 equals minus 2, u of 12

00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:07.700
equals 2.

00:22:07.700 --> 00:22:13.820
And then C is, option C is u of
8 equals minus 1, and u of 12

00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:16.670
equals 2.

00:22:16.670 --> 00:22:20.810
So which of those answers is
consistent with loss aversion?

00:22:20.810 --> 00:22:24.050
The answer is option
A. Now, why is that?

00:22:24.050 --> 00:22:28.610
Well, loss aversion sort of
implies that losses hurt more

00:22:28.610 --> 00:22:30.390
than gains help.

00:22:30.390 --> 00:22:32.780
So with preferences
as in A, Maddie

00:22:32.780 --> 00:22:35.810
would have the utility
cost of 2 from falling

00:22:35.810 --> 00:22:37.970
short of her goal
of two questions,

00:22:37.970 --> 00:22:42.200
but only a gain of 1 util
from exceeding her goal by two

00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:43.040
questions, right?

00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:49.050
So the goal of, the
game of exceeding,

00:22:49.050 --> 00:22:54.980
of being by two questions above,
so being two questions above

00:22:54.980 --> 00:22:57.050
gives her some gain of 1 util.

00:22:57.050 --> 00:22:59.240
But the utility costs of
falling short with two

00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:00.828
is twice as large,
which just tends

00:23:00.828 --> 00:23:02.495
to be kind of like
the evidence that you

00:23:02.495 --> 00:23:04.040
would see in loss aversion.

00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:07.450
And the other two examples
don't have that feature.

00:23:07.450 --> 00:23:11.480
So really only answer
number A is correct.

00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:15.950
Second question.

00:23:15.950 --> 00:23:19.580
Maddie is walking home and
passes a bakery unexpectedly.

00:23:19.580 --> 00:23:21.140
She decides to buy a pastry.

00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:23.060
For example, she
looks at the pastry,

00:23:23.060 --> 00:23:24.650
and it looks really nice.

00:23:24.650 --> 00:23:27.740
Prior to purchasing the
pastry, her maximum willingness

00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:31.010
to pay for the pastry was P0.

00:23:31.010 --> 00:23:35.030
Then she runs into Alan-- this
is our previous, excellent TA--

00:23:35.030 --> 00:23:37.640
who asks to buy the
pastry from her.

00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:41.480
She offers him the lowest price
she is willing to accept, P1.

00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:44.510
Which of the following
comparisons between P0 and P1

00:23:44.510 --> 00:23:46.910
is consistent with
an endowment effect,

00:23:46.910 --> 00:23:52.790
P0 larger than P1, P0 equals
P1, or P0 smaller than P1?

00:23:57.660 --> 00:24:01.320
The answer is answer
number C. Why is that?

00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:05.550
Well, the endowment effect
says that people are--

00:24:05.550 --> 00:24:10.590
when their willingness to
pay, that is in this case P0,

00:24:10.590 --> 00:24:13.800
is smaller than their
willingness to accept,

00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:14.860
when they accept.

00:24:14.860 --> 00:24:18.450
That is to say, being endowed
with an item in this case,

00:24:18.450 --> 00:24:22.320
like a pastry, increases
one's willingness to pay.

00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:25.380
That is to say, if somebody
asks you to sell something

00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:27.960
that you own, you
ask for more money

00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:30.690
than you're willing to
pay in the first place

00:24:30.690 --> 00:24:32.830
when you don't own the item.

00:24:32.830 --> 00:24:36.810
And so the endowment effect
will then predict that,

00:24:36.810 --> 00:24:42.150
or the endowment effect
entails that now P1 is larger

00:24:42.150 --> 00:24:46.950
than P0, which is answer
number C. So Maddie values

00:24:46.950 --> 00:24:50.010
the pastry more after
she has bought it,

00:24:50.010 --> 00:24:51.520
compared to like
prior to buying it.

00:24:54.610 --> 00:24:57.430
The third broad set of
preferences to be discussed

00:24:57.430 --> 00:24:58.660
were social preferences.

00:24:58.660 --> 00:25:00.050
We didn't quite
finish with this,

00:25:00.050 --> 00:25:02.470
so we're not going to cover
everything, in particular,

00:25:02.470 --> 00:25:05.370
not lecture 13.

00:25:05.370 --> 00:25:08.340
And the estimation part
of social preferences,

00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:13.140
which will apart from choices,
which will be at pset 4.

00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:15.817
You should understand what
social preferences are.

00:25:15.817 --> 00:25:17.400
You should also
understand how can you

00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:19.920
measure social preferences?

00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:21.940
In lab games, we
discussed at length

00:25:21.940 --> 00:25:25.290
the dictator game, the ultimatum
game, and the trust game.

00:25:25.290 --> 00:25:27.910
You should also be broadly
familiar, not in detail,

00:25:27.910 --> 00:25:29.580
but broadly familiar
of what evidence

00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:33.740
do we typically find in
dictator and ultimatum games?

00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:35.460
For instance, in
dictator games, people

00:25:35.460 --> 00:25:40.020
tend to give something like
20% to 30% of their share.

00:25:40.020 --> 00:25:42.840
People tend to be quite
nice in those games.

00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:46.305
Now, then we discussed then
like given that evidence,

00:25:46.305 --> 00:25:50.720
so given that people look quite
nice in these types of games,

00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:53.010
there's also some other
evidence people give

00:25:53.010 --> 00:25:55.900
to charity or things like that.

00:25:55.900 --> 00:25:57.720
Do we think that is
evidence of people

00:25:57.720 --> 00:26:02.410
being generally nice to others
because of poor altruism?

00:26:02.410 --> 00:26:04.960
Or if not, why not?

00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:08.520
We discussed sort of three
sets of evidence in particular.

00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:13.343
We discussed the costly exit or
exit options in dictator games.

00:26:13.343 --> 00:26:15.760
So people essentially won't
be able to leave the dictator.

00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:17.830
They rather sort
of leave and give,

00:26:17.830 --> 00:26:19.300
and sort of keep the money.

00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:22.690
Or they're willing to pay
some small amount of money

00:26:22.690 --> 00:26:24.160
to leave the
dictator game and not

00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:26.500
having to face
some other person,

00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:29.320
but it then feel compelled
to give to others.

00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:33.880
There was the option of
hiding behind the computer.

00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:35.620
If a computer gives
you the option

00:26:35.620 --> 00:26:38.590
to hide behind the computer
to be mean to others,

00:26:38.590 --> 00:26:41.560
you might take advantage of
that and actually be meaner

00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:42.780
than you would be otherwise.

00:26:42.780 --> 00:26:46.240
So altruism, or people's giving
tends to go down quite a bit

00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:49.960
when they're able to
hide behind the computer.

00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:53.040
So both of those types
of pieces of evidence

00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:56.670
are evidence of social image
being important in giving.

00:26:56.670 --> 00:26:59.580
People care a lot about
what others think,

00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:01.710
in particular what
others think about them,

00:27:01.710 --> 00:27:03.850
and they don't want
to upset others.

00:27:03.850 --> 00:27:09.420
And so if they're able to
avoid those kind of situations,

00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:10.590
they might be able to--

00:27:10.590 --> 00:27:13.230
they might want to do that,
which would suggest that it's

00:27:13.230 --> 00:27:16.650
not really that they want
others to do well in the sense

00:27:16.650 --> 00:27:19.830
that they really want others
to have money or more money

00:27:19.830 --> 00:27:23.500
than before, but rather it's
because of social pressure

00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:26.610
or social image concerns,
people might give

00:27:26.610 --> 00:27:29.580
in dictator or ultimatum games.

00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:32.460
Moreover, there's some
evidence of self-image

00:27:32.460 --> 00:27:37.000
about people caring about what
they think about themselves.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:40.410
They want to think of themselves
as being a good person.

00:27:40.410 --> 00:27:43.260
And so the evidence of
the moral wiggle room

00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:48.270
seems to suggest that these
concerns are quite important.

00:27:48.270 --> 00:27:52.890
In particular, people are
engaging in some behavior

00:27:52.890 --> 00:27:57.180
where they delude themselves
that they are in fact nice,

00:27:57.180 --> 00:27:59.610
when in reality, they're not.

00:27:59.610 --> 00:28:03.810
So that's discussed in
detail in the lecture.

00:28:03.810 --> 00:28:05.435
Again, we will not
ask, and so you

00:28:05.435 --> 00:28:07.980
should be familiar with
this type of evidence.

00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:10.380
And you should be familiar
why that sort of tells us

00:28:10.380 --> 00:28:14.100
that people are perhaps not as
nice as you might have thought.

00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:17.010
They are just coming from like
dictator or ultimatum games,

00:28:17.010 --> 00:28:19.440
or from like donations.

00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:21.540
We will not ask you
about models that

00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:23.010
estimate social preferences.

00:28:23.010 --> 00:28:26.330
That will be in problem set
4, so don't worry about that.

00:28:26.330 --> 00:28:29.530
Sort of the stuff on [INAUDIBLE]
and Rabin that's there,

00:28:29.530 --> 00:28:32.700
we will not ask you about that.

00:28:32.700 --> 00:28:35.910
OK, so then here's
another example

00:28:35.910 --> 00:28:37.800
of a true/false/uncertain
question.

00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:40.570
Statement, if a person
gives 0 in a dictator game,

00:28:40.570 --> 00:28:44.430
this is evidence that
this person is selfish.

00:28:44.430 --> 00:28:46.860
Now, the answer is false.

00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:48.490
I think if you
answer it uncertain,

00:28:48.490 --> 00:28:50.310
that would also be fine.

00:28:50.310 --> 00:28:51.060
Why is that?

00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:55.230
Well, the person might
give 0 to the other person

00:28:55.230 --> 00:28:58.745
in the dictator game and then
donate the money to someone

00:28:58.745 --> 00:28:59.807
in greater need, right?

00:28:59.807 --> 00:29:01.890
And then that person is
in fact really quite nice.

00:29:04.590 --> 00:29:06.242
Second, the person
might be very poor

00:29:06.242 --> 00:29:07.950
relative to the other
person in the game.

00:29:07.950 --> 00:29:10.650
So her marginal utility
is just very high.

00:29:10.650 --> 00:29:13.200
So now, even if you
have like equal weights

00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:17.460
to your own utility and
the other person's utility,

00:29:17.460 --> 00:29:21.090
since the marginal utility of
giving $10 to yourself compared

00:29:21.090 --> 00:29:23.820
to the other person is way
higher than the other person's

00:29:23.820 --> 00:29:28.687
marginal utility, you would just
give everything to yourself.

00:29:28.687 --> 00:29:30.770
And that doesn't mean you
don't care about others.

00:29:30.770 --> 00:29:33.380
It just means
like, in fact, even

00:29:33.380 --> 00:29:36.655
if you were sort of
like a social climber,

00:29:36.655 --> 00:29:38.030
you would give it
to that person,

00:29:38.030 --> 00:29:39.780
because that person
was like a huge meany,

00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:42.682
or the rich person just might
not really need that money.

00:29:42.682 --> 00:29:44.390
Looking at this more
closely, actually, I

00:29:44.390 --> 00:29:47.310
think uncertain would be a
better answer here, and not

00:29:47.310 --> 00:29:47.810
false.

00:29:47.810 --> 00:29:50.790
I just wrote this
question fairly quickly.

00:29:50.790 --> 00:29:53.430
So if the question says--

00:29:53.430 --> 00:29:55.020
if the question
instead were to say,

00:29:55.020 --> 00:29:59.030
this is conclusive evidence
that this person is selfish,

00:29:59.030 --> 00:30:01.340
then it would be false.

00:30:01.340 --> 00:30:03.200
Or this would be,
this is clearly

00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:04.760
evidence where
this person must be

00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:07.880
selfish, that would be false.

00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:10.670
The way it's written right now,
it's rather sort of uncertain,

00:30:10.670 --> 00:30:12.180
because we just
don't quite know.

00:30:12.180 --> 00:30:16.520
It could be that the
person is really selfish.

00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:19.320
Or it could be that the person--

00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:21.770
it could be this evidence
that the person is selfish.

00:30:21.770 --> 00:30:26.680
But it could be the other two
reasons that I just mentioned.

00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:30.640
OK, so now, finally, I'm going
to give you a long question,

00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:34.120
or an example of
a long question.

00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:36.890
And this is the question
of laptop policies.

00:30:36.890 --> 00:30:40.530
We talked about a little
bit earlier in class,

00:30:40.530 --> 00:30:42.200
in fact in the first lecture.

00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:44.560
And we had the first
problem set about this.

00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:46.480
And this is sort of like
an algebraic version

00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:49.020
of that kind of question.

00:30:49.020 --> 00:30:52.310
So assume the 14.13
students are present

00:30:52.310 --> 00:30:57.020
biased with beta small
than 1 and delta equals 0.

00:30:57.020 --> 00:30:59.450
All students have
the same beta smaller

00:30:59.450 --> 00:31:01.160
than 1 and delta equals 0.

00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:04.580
But they differ in
the value they derive

00:31:04.580 --> 00:31:07.680
from using laptops in class.

00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:11.050
L is constant for each
student from class to class,

00:31:11.050 --> 00:31:14.790
but uniformly distributed
across students on the interval

00:31:14.790 --> 00:31:17.260
between 0 and 1.

00:31:17.260 --> 00:31:21.460
So some people have
like a huge value

00:31:21.460 --> 00:31:25.255
of using the laptop in class.

00:31:25.255 --> 00:31:29.400
And others do not.

00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:32.100
Each lecture generates
no immediate utility.

00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:35.160
So it's neither fun nor
like annoying or the like.

00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:40.730
But it does give a benefit,
a future benefit of V.

00:31:40.730 --> 00:31:42.260
So like you might
learn something,

00:31:42.260 --> 00:31:45.110
or there's some things that
might be valuable to you

00:31:45.110 --> 00:31:46.280
in the future.

00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:50.810
Using a laptop reduces
the long-run benefit by D.

00:31:50.810 --> 00:31:53.730
This might be like
distractions, in particular.

00:31:53.730 --> 00:31:56.570
So you might be
distracted during class

00:31:56.570 --> 00:31:57.860
when you use a laptop.

00:31:57.860 --> 00:32:01.320
So the future benefits
are diminished by that.

00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:03.410
Maybe he had said something
really insightful,

00:32:03.410 --> 00:32:07.400
you didn't pay attention,
and so now, the benefits

00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:11.540
is B minus D if
you use a laptop.

00:32:11.540 --> 00:32:14.340
Both B and D are the
same for all students.

00:32:14.340 --> 00:32:18.170
So there's no variation
across students there.

00:32:18.170 --> 00:32:21.120
The only variation's coming
from some students who really,

00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:24.080
really like using laptops
for various reasons, perhaps

00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:27.560
because they like to
surf the internet.

00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:31.940
Perhaps they're really
in need of using laptops

00:32:31.940 --> 00:32:35.740
because that allows them
to take proper notes.

00:32:35.740 --> 00:32:40.470
So in summary, a student
uses a laptop in class--

00:32:40.470 --> 00:32:42.810
sorry, a student that
uses the laptop in class

00:32:42.810 --> 00:32:46.590
gets immediate utility L and
future, undiscounted utility

00:32:46.590 --> 00:32:50.340
of B minus D. And a student
who does not use a laptop

00:32:50.340 --> 00:32:55.390
gets immediate utility of 0 and
future discounted utility of V.

00:32:55.390 --> 00:32:59.320
So and now the social
planner is not present biased

00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:03.100
and seeks to maximize the
utility of 14.13 students

00:33:03.100 --> 00:33:05.298
from his perspective, OK?

00:33:08.620 --> 00:33:10.680
First question.

00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:14.340
Show that students are just
indifferent between using

00:33:14.340 --> 00:33:18.300
and not using a laptop
in the current class

00:33:18.300 --> 00:33:21.960
if L equals beat
times D. Explain

00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:24.270
why students with
lower values of L--

00:33:24.270 --> 00:33:27.150
so that's like L being
lower than beta D--

00:33:27.150 --> 00:33:29.070
don't use laptops in
class, but students

00:33:29.070 --> 00:33:30.570
with higher values of L--

00:33:30.570 --> 00:33:32.290
so L exceeds beta D--

00:33:32.290 --> 00:33:35.450
do use laptops in class.

00:33:35.450 --> 00:33:37.310
OK, so now what
we're going to do

00:33:37.310 --> 00:33:40.280
is we're going to write down the
utilities from the two choices.

00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:44.660
That's essentially already
given in the explanation,

00:33:44.660 --> 00:33:48.170
except for that we need to be
careful of where the beta comes

00:33:48.170 --> 00:33:48.750
in, right?

00:33:48.750 --> 00:33:52.130
So if students use
a laptop in class,

00:33:52.130 --> 00:33:55.220
they get the immediate benefit
of L. And then in the future,

00:33:55.220 --> 00:33:58.360
they get what's discounted by
beta, which is beta times B

00:33:58.360 --> 00:34:01.867
minus D, right, because
both B and D are very far

00:34:01.867 --> 00:34:02.450
in the future.

00:34:02.450 --> 00:34:06.620
These are the benefits, or the
diminished benefits, B minus D,

00:34:06.620 --> 00:34:08.210
that they get in the future.

00:34:08.210 --> 00:34:11.670
L is in the present, so
there's no beta here.

00:34:11.670 --> 00:34:14.820
Instead, if someone uses no
laptop, the students get 0.

00:34:14.820 --> 00:34:17.760
So there's no laptop
benefits in the present.

00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:21.690
And the benefits in
the future, the value

00:34:21.690 --> 00:34:24.360
of the lecture the
future is undiminished,

00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:26.429
which means essentially,
it's just V.

00:34:26.429 --> 00:34:32.570
So the person just gets
0 plus beta times V.

00:34:32.570 --> 00:34:37.219
Now, students who are
indifferent, by definition,

00:34:37.219 --> 00:34:40.670
have the same utility of using
laptops and using no laptop.

00:34:40.670 --> 00:34:44.929
So we can essentially just
equate those two things.

00:34:44.929 --> 00:34:48.020
Notice that like the beta
times B is always there.

00:34:48.020 --> 00:34:50.239
So it sort of
essentially just cancels.

00:34:50.239 --> 00:34:53.389
And then what we get is the
person that's indifferent,

00:34:53.389 --> 00:34:57.990
for that person, L
equals beta times D.

00:34:57.990 --> 00:35:02.010
Now, students that
choose not to use laptops

00:35:02.010 --> 00:35:05.490
will have low valuations
L of using laptops,

00:35:05.490 --> 00:35:07.980
while students that
choose to use the laptops

00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:10.215
have high L, right?

00:35:10.215 --> 00:35:13.110
If L is very large, then
it exceeds beta times D.

00:35:13.110 --> 00:35:17.010
If L is very small,
then L does not exceed,

00:35:17.010 --> 00:35:18.660
is smaller than beta times D.

00:35:18.660 --> 00:35:21.090
So given the
indifference condition,

00:35:21.090 --> 00:35:24.780
we have essentially, as I just
said, students that do not

00:35:24.780 --> 00:35:28.720
use the laptop, L is smaller
than beta times D. And students

00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:35.570
that use the laptop, for them,
L is larger than beta times D.

00:35:35.570 --> 00:35:37.000
OK.

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.700
OK, now question number two.

00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:42.640
Now consider the policy that
allows students to use laptops

00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:46.623
only if they sign up in advance
to sit in a laptop section.

00:35:46.623 --> 00:35:48.790
This is a little bit different
than we had in class,

00:35:48.790 --> 00:35:50.623
but it's a version, or
something that I also

00:35:50.623 --> 00:35:52.780
considered, in fact, in
previous years that that

00:35:52.780 --> 00:35:54.320
was what was used.

00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:58.480
Now, the question here is, why
is L larger or equal than D,

00:35:58.480 --> 00:36:01.500
not L is larger
equal than beta D,

00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:05.880
the threshold for opting
in to the laptop section?

00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:06.420
OK?

00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:07.980
So now this is a
choice for people

00:36:07.980 --> 00:36:10.590
to choose not for
the present, when

00:36:10.590 --> 00:36:14.130
they come to class, whether they
want to use a laptop right now.

00:36:14.130 --> 00:36:16.230
But instead, they
sign up in advance

00:36:16.230 --> 00:36:18.740
to sit in a laptop section
for the rest of the semester.

00:36:18.740 --> 00:36:20.490
So essentially, people
are in the present,

00:36:20.490 --> 00:36:24.840
and they choose for the future
whether they can use laptops

00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:26.880
in class.

00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:29.520
Now, the utility
is now different.

00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:33.030
And the key difference is that
the laptop benefits are now

00:36:33.030 --> 00:36:34.540
in the future, right?

00:36:34.540 --> 00:36:38.760
So the utility of using a laptop
now again is 0 in the present.

00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:40.410
And this is-- again,
we make choices

00:36:40.410 --> 00:36:41.733
in the present for the future.

00:36:41.733 --> 00:36:43.650
There's going to be no
utility in the present.

00:36:43.650 --> 00:36:47.850
There's no lecture right now,
no laptop benefits and the like.

00:36:47.850 --> 00:36:52.230
And in the future, everything
is discounted by beta now,

00:36:52.230 --> 00:36:55.530
because the person is
present biased potentially.

00:36:55.530 --> 00:36:59.420
So it's beta times
L plus B minus D.

00:36:59.420 --> 00:37:02.780
The utility of not using
a laptop is just 0 again.

00:37:02.780 --> 00:37:04.520
Like in the present,
nothing happens.

00:37:04.520 --> 00:37:07.190
And then in the future,
the benefits, as before,

00:37:07.190 --> 00:37:10.970
are beta times D. So the
only thing that you prepare

00:37:10.970 --> 00:37:14.840
is choice, or these two
options, the previous version,

00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:17.420
is the L now is
discounted by beta.

00:37:17.420 --> 00:37:18.950
But before, it was not.

00:37:18.950 --> 00:37:20.840
Let me just go back here.

00:37:20.840 --> 00:37:23.840
So here, you see the
L was like sort of--

00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:27.980
here, you see the L
not discounted by beta.

00:37:27.980 --> 00:37:30.490
This is when people make
choices for the present.

00:37:30.490 --> 00:37:33.080
Instead, here now, the
L is discounted by beta,

00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:34.750
because that choice is--

00:37:34.750 --> 00:37:38.662
the laptop benefits
are in the future.

00:37:38.662 --> 00:37:41.000
Now, we can do the
same thing as before.

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:43.087
Threshold for opting
in is defined as like--

00:37:43.087 --> 00:37:45.170
or you can say that's
essentially the indifference

00:37:45.170 --> 00:37:45.690
conditions.

00:37:45.690 --> 00:37:50.270
You can just equalize the two,
the utility of using the laptop

00:37:50.270 --> 00:37:51.830
or not using the laptop.

00:37:51.830 --> 00:37:54.770
And what you now get is that if
L is larger than D, or larger

00:37:54.770 --> 00:37:57.870
equals than D, then the
person uses the laptop.

00:37:57.870 --> 00:38:03.690
And otherwise, they do not.

00:38:03.690 --> 00:38:06.930
Now, why does the threshold
now change from beta D to--

00:38:06.930 --> 00:38:08.880
sorry, from beta times D to D?

00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:12.960
Well, because when laptop use
can only happen in the future,

00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:16.500
all benefits and costs are
discounted at the same rate,

00:38:16.500 --> 00:38:17.670
and that that rate is beta.

00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:24.990
OK, question number three.

00:38:24.990 --> 00:38:28.910
Assume there's no
laptop policy at all.

00:38:28.910 --> 00:38:32.630
Show that if beta times
D is smaller than L

00:38:32.630 --> 00:38:35.180
and smaller than D,
the student engages

00:38:35.180 --> 00:38:37.130
in preference reversals.

00:38:37.130 --> 00:38:40.890
She prefers not to use the
laptop in future classes

00:38:40.890 --> 00:38:43.010
but changes her mind while
she's actually sitting

00:38:43.010 --> 00:38:44.370
in those future classes.

00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:49.785
That's sort of essentially
the typical behavior

00:38:49.785 --> 00:38:50.590
of present bias.

00:38:50.590 --> 00:38:53.000
People that, when
they're present biased,

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:56.470
for at least some parameter
of constellations,

00:38:56.470 --> 00:38:57.960
people engage in present bias.

00:38:57.960 --> 00:39:00.980
So let's do the math and
see what comes out here.

00:39:00.980 --> 00:39:04.060
So when thinking about
the future laptop use,

00:39:04.060 --> 00:39:06.430
this student's problem is
identical to the problem

00:39:06.430 --> 00:39:09.340
in part B, sorry, in part 2.

00:39:09.340 --> 00:39:10.520
Why is that?

00:39:10.520 --> 00:39:15.170
Well, because she
discounts time,

00:39:15.170 --> 00:39:17.547
both one and two periods
in advance, by beta.

00:39:17.547 --> 00:39:19.255
Essentially, everything
is in the future,

00:39:19.255 --> 00:39:21.970
so you just discount
everything by beta.

00:39:21.970 --> 00:39:25.330
That's exactly kind of the
choice that we just had.

00:39:25.330 --> 00:39:26.990
So when thinking
about future class,

00:39:26.990 --> 00:39:30.070
where thinking about opting
in into a laptop section,

00:39:30.070 --> 00:39:33.360
the person makes a
choice for the future.

00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:38.660
So here, when she thinks about
any future choices, what really

00:39:38.660 --> 00:39:43.310
matters is essentially the value
of the laptop is in the future,

00:39:43.310 --> 00:39:47.660
I mean back in like part
2 that we just solved.

00:39:47.660 --> 00:39:51.950
Now, we know from part 2 that
if L equals smaller than D,

00:39:51.950 --> 00:39:54.100
then she would like to
not use the laptop, right?

00:39:54.100 --> 00:39:59.240
So we just solve for
that in part number 2.

00:39:59.240 --> 00:40:04.010
But from part number 1, we
know that if beta D is smaller

00:40:04.010 --> 00:40:07.280
than L, she will end up using
the laptop when she's actually

00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:08.600
sitting in the future class.

00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:11.720
That is to say, if she has
a choice in any given class

00:40:11.720 --> 00:40:14.150
and shows up in class,
she will say, oh,

00:40:14.150 --> 00:40:15.770
like using the laptop
would be great.

00:40:15.770 --> 00:40:19.040
The same would be true
of phones, by the way.

00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:21.860
And when she has a choice
in any given class that

00:40:21.860 --> 00:40:26.270
happens right now, if beta
D equals smaller than L,

00:40:26.270 --> 00:40:29.060
she will end up using
the laptop in class.

00:40:29.060 --> 00:40:33.560
So that implies essentially
like a preference reversal using

00:40:33.560 --> 00:40:36.510
these parameter assumptions.

00:40:36.510 --> 00:40:39.800
She prefers not to use the
laptop in future classes

00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:42.530
but switches her mind or changes
her mind when she's actually

00:40:42.530 --> 00:40:44.565
sitting in those future classes.

00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:50.870
OK, question number 4.

00:40:50.870 --> 00:40:54.830
Explain why the fraction 1
minus beta D of the class

00:40:54.830 --> 00:40:58.820
uses a laptop in part 1, but
fraction 1 minus D of the class

00:40:58.820 --> 00:41:02.150
uses the laptop in part 2.

00:41:02.150 --> 00:41:04.070
Why does a smaller
share of the class

00:41:04.070 --> 00:41:05.750
use their laptop in part 2?

00:41:09.150 --> 00:41:12.480
All right, so now we're
just essentially comparing

00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:13.740
part 1 and part 2.

00:41:13.740 --> 00:41:16.200
And I'm going to look at
what fraction of people

00:41:16.200 --> 00:41:19.758
are actually using the laptop.

00:41:19.758 --> 00:41:21.300
So we can sort of
do the math version

00:41:21.300 --> 00:41:23.920
and think about why
that answer makes sense.

00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:25.950
So in part 1, a
student uses the laptop

00:41:25.950 --> 00:41:36.570
if L is larger than beta
times D. If F is CDF of L--

00:41:36.570 --> 00:41:38.730
and then started
as a puritan thing,

00:41:38.730 --> 00:41:42.920
but to define F as the
CDF of L. And then given

00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:47.060
the uniform distribution,
the probability

00:41:47.060 --> 00:41:54.850
of L being larger than beta
D is 1 minus the CDF 1 minus

00:41:54.850 --> 00:41:57.190
F of beta delta, which
is in this uniform.

00:41:57.190 --> 00:42:00.760
It's just 1 minus beta D.

00:42:00.760 --> 00:42:03.820
Now, likewise, in part 2,
a student uses a laptop

00:42:03.820 --> 00:42:07.810
if L is larger than the D. So
we have the probability of L

00:42:07.810 --> 00:42:10.800
being larger than D
is 1 minus the CDF

00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:14.380
or the F of D,
which is 1 minus D.

00:42:14.380 --> 00:42:17.350
So a smaller share uses
the laptop in part 2,

00:42:17.350 --> 00:42:19.060
because the benefit
of using a laptop

00:42:19.060 --> 00:42:22.910
is delayed and hence
discounted by beta.

00:42:22.910 --> 00:42:24.500
So why is that?

00:42:24.500 --> 00:42:27.040
Well, essentially, think
about it like this.

00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:30.550
If somebody has
beta equals 1, which

00:42:30.550 --> 00:42:32.620
is kind of equivalent
to like part 2, where

00:42:32.620 --> 00:42:36.280
people made choices for the
future, if you use a laptop--

00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:39.190
so a share of people will
like the laptop, because--

00:42:39.190 --> 00:42:42.460
or like to use the laptop when
making choices for the future,

00:42:42.460 --> 00:42:44.680
not because of self-control
problems or the like,

00:42:44.680 --> 00:42:47.200
but just because they find lots
of really helpful in taking

00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:49.050
notes.

00:42:49.050 --> 00:42:53.100
Now, if then a person, in
addition, is present biased

00:42:53.100 --> 00:42:55.020
and makes a choice
for the present,

00:42:55.020 --> 00:42:58.950
that enhances the
short-run benefits,

00:42:58.950 --> 00:43:01.830
because now the L is not
discounted by beta anymore.

00:43:01.830 --> 00:43:07.710
And now, it's essentially,
it's given sort of the benefit.

00:43:07.710 --> 00:43:10.260
It's in the present,
and everything else beta

00:43:10.260 --> 00:43:11.560
is in the future.

00:43:11.560 --> 00:43:14.370
And so that means essentially
that when making choices

00:43:14.370 --> 00:43:17.985
for the present, the
present benefits, the L,

00:43:17.985 --> 00:43:21.030
gets more weight relative
to everything else, which

00:43:21.030 --> 00:43:24.200
is against the weight
of beta less than 1.

00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:29.010
So now, if you are already, when
making choices for the future,

00:43:29.010 --> 00:43:31.440
chose the laptop
anyway, that implies

00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:35.100
that you also choose the
laptop for the present.

00:43:35.100 --> 00:43:38.010
Essentially, anybody who chooses
the laptop for the future

00:43:38.010 --> 00:43:40.440
would also choose the
laptop for the present.

00:43:40.440 --> 00:43:42.570
And now, there are some
people essentially don't

00:43:42.570 --> 00:43:43.740
have like huge variations.

00:43:43.740 --> 00:43:45.765
They might not choose the
laptop for the future,

00:43:45.765 --> 00:43:47.640
but they might choose
it, they will choose it

00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:50.350
for the present because
of their present bias.

00:43:50.350 --> 00:43:52.223
And therefore, then
the fraction of people

00:43:52.223 --> 00:43:53.640
who choose for the
present will be

00:43:53.640 --> 00:43:56.143
larger than the
fraction of people

00:43:56.143 --> 00:43:57.810
who choose for the
future, which we just

00:43:57.810 --> 00:44:02.010
showed using some algebra.

00:44:02.010 --> 00:44:04.620
OK, then finally, why
would the social planner

00:44:04.620 --> 00:44:07.740
prefer the opt-in policy to
both the the policy of allowing

00:44:07.740 --> 00:44:10.620
students to choose whether
to use their laptops

00:44:10.620 --> 00:44:14.530
and to banning
laptops altogether?

00:44:14.530 --> 00:44:18.980
So let's think about through
this, the opt-in policy,

00:44:18.980 --> 00:44:20.975
what does that really entail?

00:44:20.975 --> 00:44:23.160
Well, the opt-in
policy, as we said,

00:44:23.160 --> 00:44:27.110
is the planner is
not present biased.

00:44:27.110 --> 00:44:30.230
So the planner would
only want students

00:44:30.230 --> 00:44:33.230
with L being larger
than D to use laptops.

00:44:33.230 --> 00:44:35.870
And so the opt-in policy,
as we just showed above,

00:44:35.870 --> 00:44:36.650
achieves this.

00:44:36.650 --> 00:44:38.090
So that's great.

00:44:38.090 --> 00:44:40.370
I know like a free
choice policy instead,

00:44:40.370 --> 00:44:44.240
students with beta times D is
smaller than L, smaller than D,

00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:46.220
will suboptimally
use their laptops,

00:44:46.220 --> 00:44:49.170
and the social planner
does not like this.

00:44:49.170 --> 00:44:51.935
On the other hand,
banning laptops altogether

00:44:51.935 --> 00:44:54.290
is suboptimal because
welfare is gained

00:44:54.290 --> 00:44:57.500
by allowing the students with
the highest valuations, with L

00:44:57.500 --> 00:44:58.670
equals--

00:44:58.670 --> 00:45:01.670
sorry, L larger than D
to use laptops, right?

00:45:01.670 --> 00:45:04.170
So banning laptops is not great
because essentially, there's

00:45:04.170 --> 00:45:05.545
some people who
really would love

00:45:05.545 --> 00:45:07.910
to use their laptops
regardless of present bias.

00:45:07.910 --> 00:45:11.660
And not allowing
that is not great.

00:45:11.660 --> 00:45:13.910
Free choice is not great,
because essentially,

00:45:13.910 --> 00:45:16.250
once you let people
choose any given day,

00:45:16.250 --> 00:45:18.440
temptation will sort of
kick in, and some people

00:45:18.440 --> 00:45:20.210
will suboptimally
use their laptops

00:45:20.210 --> 00:45:23.150
and just surf the internet
all day, or all class,

00:45:23.150 --> 00:45:24.560
and not learn very much.

00:45:24.560 --> 00:45:29.330
And instead, the policy where
people opt in for the future

00:45:29.330 --> 00:45:32.330
essentially achieves
the objective

00:45:32.330 --> 00:45:36.740
of the social planner, who
wants only students with L

00:45:36.740 --> 00:45:39.320
larger than D to
use their laptops.

00:45:39.320 --> 00:45:42.530
And the social planner will
be happy, and therefore

00:45:42.530 --> 00:45:45.860
prefer that policy
over both free choice

00:45:45.860 --> 00:45:48.170
and over banning laptops.

00:45:52.650 --> 00:45:53.400
So that's the end.

00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:56.970
That's all I have to say about
getting ready for the exam.

00:45:56.970 --> 00:45:59.310
And I think you should
prepare well and try

00:45:59.310 --> 00:46:01.260
to look at the materials.

00:46:01.260 --> 00:46:04.530
Please ask any questions in
case things aren't clear.

00:46:04.530 --> 00:46:15.200
Again, I have office
hours on Friday, April 3

00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:16.940
at 4:30 to 6:00.

00:46:16.940 --> 00:46:18.530
I emailed you about that.

00:46:18.530 --> 00:46:22.280
[INAUDIBLE] also has office
hours from 1:30 to 3:30.

00:46:22.280 --> 00:46:24.050
Again, that's in my email.

00:46:24.050 --> 00:46:26.600
If you have questions,
please let us

00:46:26.600 --> 00:46:29.840
know in particular on Piazza
or during office hours.

00:46:29.840 --> 00:46:33.380
But in any case, please do not
worry too much about the exam.

00:46:33.380 --> 00:46:35.840
Try your best, and
you will do great.

00:46:35.840 --> 00:46:38.480
But you know, even if you
don't do great, you'll be fine.

00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:41.570
You will pass this class as
long as you take the exam

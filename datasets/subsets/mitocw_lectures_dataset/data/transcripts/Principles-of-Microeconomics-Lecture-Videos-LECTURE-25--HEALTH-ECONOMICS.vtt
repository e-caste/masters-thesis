00:00:09.903 --> 00:00:11.486
JONATHAN GRUBER: So
today, we're going

00:00:11.486 --> 00:00:12.850
to have sort of a
different kind of class

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:14.040
since it's the last class.

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.170
Today, I'm going to talk
about essentially how

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.190
we bring to bear the set of
issues we've talked about

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:26.250
this semester to a
real-world topic,

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.740
and actually, how it plays
out in policy and practice.

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.930
And I'll draw on some
of my own experience,

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:33.870
having applied the kind
of tools we learned

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.460
in 14.01 to the field of health
care economics for 25 years,

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.790
and how that has led
me to be able to help

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.330
in the development of health
care policy in the US,

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:49.140
and talk about sort of where
health care policy stands

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:49.885
at this point.

00:00:49.885 --> 00:00:51.510
So let's get a little
bit of background

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.373
about health care in the US.

00:00:54.373 --> 00:00:56.790
Basically, when we're talking
about health care in the US,

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:01.530
we have to recognize that
the US spends, by far,

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.660
the most money on health
care of any developed

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.069
nation in the world.

00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:09.390
We spend about 17 and 1/2%
of our gross domestic product

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:10.770
on health care.

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.380
That amounts to almost $10,000
per man, woman, and child--

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.730
every man, woman,
and child in America.

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:20.100
That dwarfs the
rest of the world.

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.610
The typical European nation
spends about 2/3 as much

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.310
as a percent of
GDP on health care.

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.880
England spends less than
half as much on health care.

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.940
So basically, we spend
a lot on health care

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:35.280
as a share of our economy.

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.520
And what do we get for it?

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.010
Well, the evidence here--

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:42.090
the first fact is clear.

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.340
The evidence that we get for
it is a little bit mixed.

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.840
So if you look at the
typical thing on the web,

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.620
you know, US health
care is terrible.

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:49.440
Our money's wasted.

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.855
You'll see that on things
like infant mortality,

00:01:51.855 --> 00:01:54.150
we rate, like,
20th in the world.

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:56.650
Or life expectancy, we're,
like, 20th in the world.

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.910
So by those metrics,
we don't do very well.

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:03.480
But in fact, those metrics
are misleading because we also

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:04.050
have--

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:06.330
we have the most unequal health
care system in the world.

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:07.747
So the right way
to think about it

00:02:07.747 --> 00:02:10.080
is to think about the
haves and the have-nots.

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.880
The haves, which is us and
most people in America,

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.260
people who are
well-insured in the system,

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.010
actually get probably
the best health care

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.493
in the world, Now that might
be disputed by many people.

00:02:21.493 --> 00:02:23.160
But I think about
this like an economist

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.530
would think about it,
which is, how would you

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.130
decide whether you would prefer
product A versus product B,

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.620
whether they buy product
A versus product B?

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.053
Every year, one million
people come to the US

00:02:34.053 --> 00:02:35.970
to get treated for their
health care problems.

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.147
No one leaves.

00:02:37.147 --> 00:02:38.730
No one's going to
England for surgery.

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.900
No one's flying from the
US to England for surgery.

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.810
They're coming here.

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.330
If you're in the system, we
have the best health care

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:46.440
in the world.

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.360
Unfortunately, if you're
out of the system,

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.485
we have some of the worst
health care in the world.

00:02:50.485 --> 00:02:52.860
So a white baby born
in America today,

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.460
there's roughly a slightly
more than 0.5% chance

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.530
the baby will die
in their first year.

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:04.500
That's comparable
to northern Europe.

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.420
If you look at a black
baby born in the US,

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:07.878
the odds they die
in the first year

00:03:07.878 --> 00:03:11.410
are about twice that, which
is worse than Barbados.

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.290
So the problem in the US is
not that our outcomes are bad.

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.290
The problem is
they're very unequal--

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.750
that we're spending
all this money.

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.000
We're delivering good,
but not exceptional,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.950
outcomes for people
in the system

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:25.870
and bad outcomes for
people out of the system.

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:27.130
So clearly, we're not
getting a lot of value--

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:29.760
it's not like we deliver
exceptionally good outcomes

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:30.760
to people in the system.

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.530
We're slightly better,
despite spending a lot more,

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:35.530
and we're worse for
many Americans who

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:37.340
are left out of the system.

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.085
So that's sort of the setup of
where we are, which is really,

00:03:41.085 --> 00:03:42.460
you have two
fundamental problems

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:43.690
in health care in the US.

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:48.380
Our spending is too high, and
our access is too unequal.

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:52.483
Now so I want to focus today's
lecture on those two aspects

00:03:52.483 --> 00:03:54.650
and think about how can we
bring the kind of lessons

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:57.290
we've learned in this course
to thinking about addressing

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:58.710
those problems.

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:01.070
So I'm going to focus on the
access problem and the cost

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:02.150
problem.

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:04.250
Let's start with
the access problem.

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:11.350
Now in America, before 2010,
we had about-- or before 2014,

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:14.060
we had about 50 million
uninsured Americans.

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.375
50 million people
who did not have

00:04:16.375 --> 00:04:17.500
health insurance in the US.

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.300
We're the only
nation in the world--

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:21.130
only developed
nation in the world

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:24.280
with a significant
uninsured population.

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.430
Now the fact that 50 million
people are uninsured,

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:29.810
is that a problem?

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:32.505
On its face, if I just
said here's a fact.

00:04:32.505 --> 00:04:34.880
50 million people in America
don't have health insurance.

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.770
Based on that fact
alone, can you

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:39.932
tell me whether there's
a problem or not?

00:04:39.932 --> 00:04:40.890
You shook your head no.

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:42.290
Why not?

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:45.320
AUDIENCE: Because it might be
better for you not to have--

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:46.280
JONATHAN GRUBER: Yeah.

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:48.905
You know, many more people than
that don't have flat-screen TVs

00:04:48.905 --> 00:04:50.360
and don't own homes.

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.370
Why do we think
that we should care

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:54.360
if people don't have something?

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:58.680
The answer would be, we
would only care if what?

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:01.008
Under what condition?

00:05:01.008 --> 00:05:01.800
When do we-- yeah--

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.883
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:04.883 --> 00:05:06.300
JONATHAN GRUBER:
If-- well, they'd

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:07.723
be better off if
they did have it.

00:05:07.723 --> 00:05:10.140
Now they could be better off
because they could be richer,

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:11.340
but that's not our problem.

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:13.240
Given their budget,
they're not buying it.

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:16.290
What-- under what condition
is the market not--

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:18.720
under what type of conditions
would the market not

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.817
deliver the best outcome?

00:05:21.817 --> 00:05:23.400
AUDIENCE: If there's
a failure, like--

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:25.370
JONATHAN GRUBER: If
there's a market failure.

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:27.070
So the fact that
people aren't insured

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:31.930
doesn't matter except A, if
there's a market failure, or B,

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:33.232
for redistribution purposes.

00:05:33.232 --> 00:05:34.690
Remember, that's
the two reasons we

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:36.640
want the government involved.

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:40.660
So if health insurance markets
were perfectly functioning

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:42.520
and people who were
uninsured were roughly

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:44.478
equally distributed in
income as everyone else,

00:05:44.478 --> 00:05:45.880
there'd be no cause for worry.

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:47.540
But in fact, that's not true.

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:49.120
We've talked in
this class about why

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.280
markets like health insurance
won't function well,

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:54.112
which is a problem
of adverse selection.

00:05:54.112 --> 00:05:55.570
The problem is
information failures

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:58.390
which will lead health insurance
markets not to function well.

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:00.400
And the people who
are uninsured tend

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:02.650
to be much poorer than the
people who are insured.

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:04.302
It's also
redistributional concern.

00:06:04.302 --> 00:06:06.010
So the reason we care
about the uninsured

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:08.170
are both because
of market failures

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:10.780
and for redistribution, that
they tend to be lower-income.

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:12.790
What's interesting
is the uninsured

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:15.350
don't tend to be the
poorest in society.

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:16.905
They tend to be the near poor.

00:06:16.905 --> 00:06:19.030
So here's the way sort of
health insurance coverage

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:21.530
works in the US.

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:23.150
For the vast majority
of Americans--

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:24.880
60% of American--

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:27.290
60% of Americans
have what's called

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:29.450
employer- sponsored insurance.

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:32.450
So like your most
of your parents,

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:36.290
like me, they get health
insurance from their employer.

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:38.870
The typical upper-income
American gets health insurance

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:39.902
from their employer.

00:06:39.902 --> 00:06:41.610
The typical average-income
American does.

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:45.320
About 60% of Americans.

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:48.770
Then-- and I'm going to
do this sort of pre-ACA.

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:51.110
So before 2014,
before the big change

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:53.660
that was put in place by
the Affordable Care Act,

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:58.220
you had about another,
maybe, 6% that

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:02.810
bought into what we call
individual or non-group health

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:04.010
insurance.

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:06.980
That is, they went out on
their own and bought insurance.

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:10.353
But that's a tiny
market compared to ESI.

00:07:10.353 --> 00:07:12.770
And the reason is because of
exactly the adverse selection

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:14.830
problem we talked about.

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:17.440
Think about yourself
as an insurer.

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:19.900
And you're worried about
yourself as an insurer.

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:22.060
And think about
what your goal is.

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:25.030
Your goal as an insurer
is to essentially absorb

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:29.200
risk in a way that allows
you to make a profit.

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:31.200
So what you want is
you want to live off

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:33.240
the law of large numbers.

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:36.300
You know that with a
large enough group,

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:38.950
you could be able to predict
what their costs will be.

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:41.550
And therefore, you can
just make a profit on top.

00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:44.490
So insurers love-- when
MIT comes to an insurer,

00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:45.240
they're delighted.

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:48.810
They're like, look, you got--
between MIT and Lincoln Labs,

00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:50.880
you've got about
10,000 employees.

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:53.580
I, with great
certainty, can predict

00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:55.920
what the costs will be next
year for a group of 10,000

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:57.360
employees.

00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:58.770
And so I, as an
insurer, can know

00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:02.040
I can just charge that, plus
X percent, and I'm golden.

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:04.120
But when Jon Gruber
walks in the door,

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:06.330
they're like, why are you
coming to me, individual?

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:08.038
Maybe because you know
you're sick, maybe

00:08:08.038 --> 00:08:09.270
because you love skydiving.

00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:09.937
I don't know.

00:08:09.937 --> 00:08:12.270
But I'm wary of you, so I'm
to charge you a lot of money

00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:13.830
to get health insurance.

00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:17.130
As a result, most-- very few
people bought health insurance

00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:17.950
on their own.

00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:20.400
And in particular, the
reason they didn't is

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:23.340
because insurers would not
offer health insurance to people

00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:24.978
if they were at all sick.

00:08:24.978 --> 00:08:26.520
They would do things
like having what

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:30.330
we call pre-existing
conditions exclusions.

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:38.659
These were features of insurance
contracts which said, look,

00:08:38.659 --> 00:08:41.659
you walked in the door, Jon,
and you want health insurance.

00:08:41.659 --> 00:08:46.380
But I know, in the past, you've
had cancer or asthma or knee

00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:46.880
surgery.

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:49.630
I'm going to tell you,
I'm going to insure you,

00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:52.600
but not for any expenses that
might arise from recurrence

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:53.830
of those past injuries.

00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:55.150
So you had cancer in the past.

00:08:55.150 --> 00:08:56.850
Anything that comes up in the
future because you had cancer,

00:08:56.850 --> 00:08:58.270
I'm not going to cover.

00:08:58.270 --> 00:08:59.140
Anything that comes
up in the future

00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:00.790
because you had knee surgery,
I'm not going to cover.

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:02.380
Anything that comes up in the
future because you had asthma,

00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:03.815
I'm not going to cover it.

00:09:03.815 --> 00:09:06.190
So I'm going to give you,
essentially, partial insurance.

00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:07.732
So it's going to be
a market failure.

00:09:07.732 --> 00:09:11.950
I'm going to insure you, but
only for part of what you need.

00:09:11.950 --> 00:09:14.830
Alternatively, they could
use pre-existing condition

00:09:14.830 --> 00:09:16.570
solutions-- they could
use what is called

00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:23.630
medical underwriting,
which was basically saying,

00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:24.500
OK, Jon, come in.

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:26.667
I'm going to give you an
exam, and if you look sick,

00:09:26.667 --> 00:09:28.400
I'm going to deny you insurance.

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:30.858
Or if you look sick, I'm going
to charge you 100 times more

00:09:30.858 --> 00:09:32.210
than someone else.

00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:35.830
So these were not
illegal or even immoral.

00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:38.410
These were just ways
insurers came up with

00:09:38.410 --> 00:09:40.630
to try to deal with the
adverse selection problem.

00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:42.700
As a result, this
was a market that

00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:43.890
did not function very well.

00:09:43.890 --> 00:09:44.723
Question about that?

00:09:44.723 --> 00:09:45.640
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:48.340
JONATHAN GRUBER: No, totally
legal in every state--

00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:51.790
virtually every state,
totally legal and not immoral.

00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:54.040
I mean, this is just they're
maximizing their profits.

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:55.870
It's what companies do.

00:09:55.870 --> 00:09:58.360
And the point is that when
they did this, what this meant

00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:00.562
was if you didn't have
employer-sponsored insurance

00:10:00.562 --> 00:10:02.395
or insurance from the
government, which I'll

00:10:02.395 --> 00:10:05.290
come to next, then you
were subject to the fact

00:10:05.290 --> 00:10:07.178
that if you got
sick, you might not

00:10:07.178 --> 00:10:09.220
be able to get insurance,
which is sort of weird.

00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:11.020
Insurance is supposed
to cover if you're sick.

00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:12.437
But in fact, if
you were sick, you

00:10:12.437 --> 00:10:14.440
might not be able to get it.

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:16.690
So that was the fundamental
market failure we had here

00:10:16.690 --> 00:10:19.290
through adverse selection.

00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:22.650
Now we also-- that was
employer-sponsored insurance,

00:10:22.650 --> 00:10:26.280
so that was about 2/3
of the population.

00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:32.160
You also had on the order
of 15% of the population had

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:33.900
government-sponsored insurance--

00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:39.622
probably more like 20%.

00:10:39.622 --> 00:10:41.580
20% of the population
had government-sponsored.

00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:43.340
Insurance.

00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:51.770
The two big programs here are
called Medicare and Medicaid.

00:10:51.770 --> 00:10:54.920
Now if you ever
take my 1441 class,

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:56.930
I will only hold you
responsible for one thing

00:10:56.930 --> 00:10:58.700
if I ever meet you
10 years later, which

00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:01.640
is remember the difference
between these two programs.

00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:05.000
Medicare is health
insurance for the elderly.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.830
Medicaid is health
insurance for the poor.

00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:10.835
And those are our two big
public insurance programs.

00:11:13.132 --> 00:11:15.090
And about 20-- and if
you're in those programs,

00:11:15.090 --> 00:11:16.267
you're also set.

00:11:16.267 --> 00:11:17.850
They don't have any
of these features.

00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:20.650
If you're in, you're
covered for everything.

00:11:20.650 --> 00:11:23.050
So about 20% of
people are there.

00:11:23.050 --> 00:11:25.690
And then finally, if you add up
the numbers, we had about 15--

00:11:25.690 --> 00:11:28.600
the numbers don't quite add
up, but you had about 15%

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:30.130
of the population was uninsured.

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:34.250
15% uninsured.

00:11:34.250 --> 00:11:37.340
So you had about 2/3 private,
about one fifth public,

00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:39.276
and about one sixth uninsured.

00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:44.270
And those are individuals
who typically were not

00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:47.500
the poorest because the
poorest people got Medicaid.

00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:49.210
The typical uninsured
person is, like,

00:11:49.210 --> 00:11:51.983
what we call the working
poor, someone who's got a job,

00:11:51.983 --> 00:11:54.400
but it's a crappy job that
doesn't offer health insurance.

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:55.900
But they make enough
money that they

00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:58.660
can't qualify for being
in the low-income program.

00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:02.952
So your family is struggling at,
like, $40,000, $50,000 a year,

00:12:02.952 --> 00:12:04.410
high enough income
that they're not

00:12:04.410 --> 00:12:06.910
qualifying for Medicaid but not
in a good enough job they're

00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:07.998
getting health insurance.

00:12:07.998 --> 00:12:09.540
That's your typical
uninsured family.

00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:12.360
2/3 of the uninsured
are in families

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:15.450
that are headed by a
full-time, full-year worker.

00:12:15.450 --> 00:12:17.760
They're not typically the
unemployed down-on-their luck

00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:18.340
people.

00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:19.715
They typically
are the people who

00:12:19.715 --> 00:12:22.470
are trying to play by the
rules, as they say in politics,

00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:25.710
but typically can't get a
job with health insurance.

00:12:25.710 --> 00:12:27.780
So that's your basic landscape.

00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:29.460
And what we know
from that landscape

00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:31.980
is that a lot of
the access problems

00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:34.110
were because of this
group and this group

00:12:34.110 --> 00:12:36.960
because the people who couldn't
get in this market, and as

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:39.140
a result, were often uninsured.

00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:42.670
That was a lot of what
drove the access problems.

00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:45.250
So that was sort of the first--

00:12:45.250 --> 00:12:48.680
one of the two big problems
that faced our system.

00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:51.770
And for many, many years,
we knew we had that problem.

00:12:51.770 --> 00:12:54.920
And for about 100
years, we've tried

00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:57.620
to reform health care in
the US to deal that problem.

00:12:57.620 --> 00:12:59.270
And probably about
every 17 years,

00:12:59.270 --> 00:13:01.687
on average, there was a big
attempt to reform health care,

00:13:01.687 --> 00:13:02.960
and they always failed.

00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:05.180
And they always
failed because they

00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:07.935
failed between two extremes.

00:13:07.935 --> 00:13:10.060
There were two extreme
views that could never quite

00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:11.332
meet in the middle ground.

00:13:11.332 --> 00:13:13.540
And they come to what I
talked about last time, which

00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:16.840
is how do we solve the
problem of market failures

00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:18.730
in insurance markets?

00:13:18.730 --> 00:13:21.760
Well, one version of
solving that, I described,

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:23.020
was subsidization.

00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:28.180
You could-- remember,
with my MIT program,

00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:31.230
if I paid the healthy guys
$500, they'd all buy two,

00:13:31.230 --> 00:13:33.120
and I'd solve the problem.

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:34.570
So one version
was subsidization.

00:13:34.570 --> 00:13:39.280
The problem is
subsidization only works

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:41.890
if it's big enough to
overcome these problems.

00:13:41.890 --> 00:13:43.960
And no one ever proposed
subsidization big enough

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:45.270
to overcome these problems.

00:13:45.270 --> 00:13:46.510
In my MIT example,
I was going to give

00:13:46.510 --> 00:13:48.210
$400 to every
healthy-- first of all,

00:13:48.210 --> 00:13:49.510
it means giving money
to healthy people, which

00:13:49.510 --> 00:13:50.650
is sort of
politically difficult.

00:13:50.650 --> 00:13:53.050
Like, hey, the healthier you
are, the more money you get.

00:13:53.050 --> 00:13:54.340
It seems a bit weird.

00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:56.200
Also, it's just hard
to solve these problems

00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:57.585
by just subsidizing people.

00:13:57.585 --> 00:13:58.960
Insurance companies
are still too

00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:01.045
good at trying to get
rid of the sick people.

00:14:01.045 --> 00:14:02.920
And even if you subsidize
people who come in,

00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:04.990
insurance companies will
always have an incentive.

00:14:04.990 --> 00:14:06.430
They'll say, great, healthy
people come, we'll subsidize.

00:14:06.430 --> 00:14:08.038
They'll still want
to avoid the sick.

00:14:08.038 --> 00:14:10.330
So it doesn't solve the
problem in insurance companies.

00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:11.320
I didn't talk about
this last time,

00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:12.790
but as MIT's
insurance company, I

00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:14.770
should try to shed
the sick people.

00:14:14.770 --> 00:14:18.290
And that problem still
existed under this solution.

00:14:18.290 --> 00:14:22.900
The other extreme, which is
sort of back in style again,

00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:28.018
is the single-payer model,
which is saying, look,

00:14:28.018 --> 00:14:30.310
let's just have the government
provide health insurance

00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:31.460
to everyone.

00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:33.940
We have the government provide
Social Security to everyone.

00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:34.990
The government provides
health insurers

00:14:34.990 --> 00:14:37.210
to every elderly in
America through Medicare.

00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:38.980
Everyone over 65
in America, boom,

00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:40.900
gets government-provided
health insurance.

00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:43.010
Talk about socialism.

00:14:43.010 --> 00:14:44.500
Every American gets that.

00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:47.710
In Canada, everybody gets
government-provided health

00:14:47.710 --> 00:14:48.580
insurance.

00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:50.170
Why not just do it here?

00:14:50.170 --> 00:14:52.420
Let's get rid of all the
crap with insurance companies

00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:53.170
we don't like.

00:14:53.170 --> 00:14:56.050
After all, insurance
company administrative costs

00:14:56.050 --> 00:14:59.080
are about 15% of
medical spending.

00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:02.350
So, boom, we could lower
15% of medical spending.

00:15:02.350 --> 00:15:06.190
That is, you know, that's
like $500 billion a year.

00:15:06.190 --> 00:15:08.170
Boom, it's gone.

00:15:08.170 --> 00:15:10.702
So basically, why not-- so
single payer is something

00:15:10.702 --> 00:15:12.160
a lot of people
have advocated for.

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:14.327
Let's just have one giant
universal health insurance

00:15:14.327 --> 00:15:15.770
program.

00:15:15.770 --> 00:15:17.960
Now the problem with this--

00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:20.060
the problem with the
single-payer approach is

00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:20.720
largely--

00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:23.600
there's pros and cons to
the economics perspective.

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:27.040
But the problems here
are largely political,

00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:29.820
which is that to make
single payer happen,

00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:32.572
you have three enormous
political barriers,

00:15:32.572 --> 00:15:33.780
which come back to economics.

00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:35.820
Everything comes
back to economics,

00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:39.570
but they play their way out
in the political system.

00:15:39.570 --> 00:15:44.260
The first problem
is paying for it--

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:50.262
paying for it, which
is that single payer--

00:15:50.262 --> 00:15:52.470
to have the government give
everyone health insurance

00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:54.553
means a massive expansion
in the government, which

00:15:54.553 --> 00:15:56.550
means a big increase in taxes.

00:15:56.550 --> 00:15:58.380
And we know taxes
have deadweight loss.

00:15:58.380 --> 00:16:01.180
We know taxes are
politically unpopular.

00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:03.832
Now here's what's
misleading about that.

00:16:03.832 --> 00:16:05.040
Here's the fundamental thing.

00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:06.717
So I worked for the
state of Vermont.

00:16:06.717 --> 00:16:09.300
The state of Vermont wanted to
do their own single-payer plan.

00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:10.842
If any place can do
it, it's Vermont.

00:16:10.842 --> 00:16:12.040
They're, like, super lefty.

00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:13.873
They essentially have
one insurance carrier,

00:16:13.873 --> 00:16:15.460
which is Blue Cross anyway.

00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:16.420
They're a small state.

00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:17.200
It seemed like if anyone
was going to do it,

00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:17.930
Vermont was going to do it.

00:16:17.930 --> 00:16:19.630
So I worked with them to
put the numbers together,

00:16:19.630 --> 00:16:20.630
what it would cost them.

00:16:20.630 --> 00:16:22.840
And I had good
news and bad news.

00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:25.350
The good news was,
I said to Vermont,

00:16:25.350 --> 00:16:27.930
if you do single payer you will
lower the cost of health care

00:16:27.930 --> 00:16:31.330
in Vermont total by at
least 10%, at least.

00:16:31.330 --> 00:16:33.400
That was conservative.

00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:35.085
The bad news is to
pay for it, you're

00:16:35.085 --> 00:16:37.210
going to have to more than
double the entire amount

00:16:37.210 --> 00:16:40.040
of taxes collected
in state of Vermont.

00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:43.960
And that second sentence
just killed everything.

00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:45.260
What's the problem?

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:49.210
The problem is that right now
health insurance in America

00:16:49.210 --> 00:16:53.340
is paid for by
essentially a hidden tax.

00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:54.652
What's the hidden tax?

00:16:54.652 --> 00:16:56.610
It's the fact that when
your employer gives you

00:16:56.610 --> 00:17:00.410
health insurance, they pay
you less wages as a result.

00:17:00.410 --> 00:17:03.480
Remember our tax
incidence discussion.

00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:06.060
And we said that essentially
taxing the employer

00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:07.829
falls on the
employer-employee depending

00:17:07.829 --> 00:17:10.500
on basically elasticities.

00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:12.843
Well, you can think of health
insurance the same way.

00:17:12.843 --> 00:17:14.760
When your employer gives
you health insurance,

00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:16.680
he doesn't just
eat the whole cost.

00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:19.283
He says, look, I'm paying you
a total set of compensation,

00:17:19.283 --> 00:17:20.700
part of which is
health insurance.

00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:22.950
So I'm going to pass the
cost of that health insurance

00:17:22.950 --> 00:17:25.500
on at least partially
to your wages.

00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:27.000
That's essentially a hidden tax.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.260
So at MIT-- right now, I
have a health insurance plan

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:34.610
through MIT, which costs about
$18,000 a year for my family.

00:17:34.610 --> 00:17:36.830
I pay about $6,000 a
year out of my paycheck.

00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:38.960
MIT pays $12,000.

00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:41.895
But the truth is, MIT
pays me $12,000 less.

00:17:41.895 --> 00:17:43.770
They don't just give me
that health insurance

00:17:43.770 --> 00:17:45.640
out the goodness of their heart.

00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:47.650
They take it out of
my wages, or least

00:17:47.650 --> 00:17:50.180
partially out of my wages.

00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:53.300
That's essentially a hidden tax
that Americans pay every year

00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:55.070
to finance health insurance.

00:17:55.070 --> 00:17:58.190
If we went to single payer,
that hidden tax would go away.

00:17:58.190 --> 00:18:00.860
I would get a $12,000 raise.

00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:01.640
That's great.

00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:04.190
But I'd also face
a high new taxation

00:18:04.190 --> 00:18:07.085
to pay for the
government-sponsored plan.

00:18:07.085 --> 00:18:08.960
Now given that the total
cost would fall-- we

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:12.220
should be able to net this out
in a way that most people win.

00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:14.280
The problem then
becomes the politics,

00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:17.900
which is you're tracing a hidden
tax with a non-hidden tax.

00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:20.073
And that's very
ugly politically.

00:18:20.073 --> 00:18:22.490
So people don't believe their
employers will pay them more

00:18:22.490 --> 00:18:24.110
if you don't make the employers
provide health insurers, like,

00:18:24.110 --> 00:18:25.693
oh, the employers
will just pocket it.

00:18:25.693 --> 00:18:28.260
And I could teach them tax
incidence till my face is blue,

00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:29.570
but they just won't believe it.

00:18:29.570 --> 00:18:31.460
They'll say employers
will just pocket it.

00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:33.550
But I have to pay this
new tax for single payer.

00:18:33.550 --> 00:18:35.630
So that's the first
problem single payer faces

00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:37.213
is that people don't
really understand

00:18:37.213 --> 00:18:39.620
that trade-off between
getting rid of the hidden tax

00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:41.900
and adding a new non-hidden tax.

00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:44.530
That's problem one.

00:18:44.530 --> 00:18:48.490
Problem two is the problem
we talked a little bit

00:18:48.490 --> 00:18:51.080
about, behavioral economics,
and about loss aversion.

00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:53.800
There's a general feature,
what we call status quo

00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:56.950
bias in human thinking.

00:18:56.950 --> 00:19:01.512
Status quo bias, which
is, essentially, it

00:19:01.512 --> 00:19:03.220
is harder for me to
give up what I'm used

00:19:03.220 --> 00:19:06.392
to than to grab something new.

00:19:06.392 --> 00:19:07.725
We talked about the mug example.

00:19:07.725 --> 00:19:08.975
Remember, I talked about mugs.

00:19:08.975 --> 00:19:10.643
So basically, you
had to pay me more

00:19:10.643 --> 00:19:13.310
to get the mug away from me than
I was willing to pay to buy it.

00:19:13.310 --> 00:19:15.500
That once you have something,
you value it more than

00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:16.760
if you didn't have it yet.

00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:18.800
Well, right now,
60% of Americans

00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:21.310
have employer-sponsored
insurance.

00:19:21.310 --> 00:19:25.620
And if we say to them, give
that up for Berniecare,

00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:27.510
they're going to be,
like, eh, I don't know.

00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:28.860
I kind of like my
employer-sponsored insurance.

00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:30.150
You know, yeah,
you might tell me

00:19:30.150 --> 00:19:31.380
Berniecare is
going to be better,

00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:32.280
but that's just you talking.

00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:33.400
I know what I have
right now, which I have

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:34.740
employer-sponsored insurance.

00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:37.170
I don't want to move away
from that status quo.

00:19:37.170 --> 00:19:39.330
So status quo bias makes
it hard, in general,

00:19:39.330 --> 00:19:41.470
to do radical changes
on an economic system.

00:19:41.470 --> 00:19:42.720
And this is a perfect example.

00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:44.400
It's going to be hard
to get people to give up

00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:46.680
what they have for something
that they don't really

00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:48.994
know about yet.

00:19:48.994 --> 00:19:50.490
That's the second problem.

00:19:50.490 --> 00:19:52.460
The third problem is,
once again about money,

00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:55.040
but really beyond the
scope of this course, which

00:19:55.040 --> 00:20:04.920
is the problem of the insurance
companies and lobbying, which

00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:08.370
is that the insurance business
is big business in America.

00:20:08.370 --> 00:20:13.630
Health insurance companies
make about $900 billion a year.

00:20:13.630 --> 00:20:15.850
If you said to them, hey,
health insurance companies,

00:20:15.850 --> 00:20:18.820
would you guys mind just
giving up your $900 billion

00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:20.320
to begin a single-payer
health care,

00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:22.320
they'd actually say, yeah,
it's been a good run.

00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:23.350
Go for it.

00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:23.860
No.

00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:25.943
They're going to lobby and
fight that because they

00:20:25.943 --> 00:20:27.130
want to keep their business.

00:20:27.130 --> 00:20:29.422
And that's going to be a
pretty hard force to overcome.

00:20:29.422 --> 00:20:31.773
So single payer has
always struggled

00:20:31.773 --> 00:20:33.940
with dealing with these
kinds of political problems.

00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:35.890
And that's why we've been stuck.

00:20:35.890 --> 00:20:38.012
We've been stuck between
one alternative, which

00:20:38.012 --> 00:20:40.095
is subsidization, and the
other alternative, which

00:20:40.095 --> 00:20:41.770
is single payer.

00:20:41.770 --> 00:20:44.410
And that's where
economists have come in--

00:20:44.410 --> 00:20:47.700
came in the 2000s,
folks like myself,

00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:49.270
to talk about a
new alternative way

00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:53.110
to do it, which was
essentially to try

00:20:53.110 --> 00:20:55.720
to bring in some of the
best features of these two

00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:58.230
approaches.

00:20:58.230 --> 00:21:00.685
And the solution we proposed--

00:21:00.685 --> 00:21:02.310
so if you want to
read more about this,

00:21:02.310 --> 00:21:04.470
I've actually written a
comic book to explain it.

00:21:04.470 --> 00:21:06.808
It's a graphic
novel, technically.

00:21:06.808 --> 00:21:08.100
It's called Health Care Reform.

00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:09.970
It's, like, $9 on Amazon.

00:21:09.970 --> 00:21:12.303
And so I like to think of
everything in terms of images.

00:21:12.303 --> 00:21:13.553
Now I'm not going to draw one.

00:21:13.553 --> 00:21:15.210
I'm not going to try
to draw anything.

00:21:15.210 --> 00:21:17.585
But the way I like to think
about this is the solution we

00:21:17.585 --> 00:21:20.298
came up with, which we first
pioneered here in Massachusetts

00:21:20.298 --> 00:21:21.840
and then brought to
the whole country

00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:23.298
through the Affordable
Care Act, is

00:21:23.298 --> 00:21:28.270
what we call a
three-legged-stool approach,

00:21:28.270 --> 00:21:30.160
three-legged-stool approach.

00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:33.640
Leg one is deal
with this problem.

00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:36.310
Deal with the insurance
discrimination problem.

00:21:36.310 --> 00:21:41.121
And so leg one is ban
insurer discrimination.

00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:48.010
No more pre-existing conditions,
no more medical underwriting.

00:21:48.010 --> 00:21:51.563
That is, if I walk in the door,
and you have offered anyone--

00:21:51.563 --> 00:21:53.980
you have to offer me health
insurance at the average price

00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:54.640
for my age.

00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:55.960
And you have to offer it to me.

00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:57.940
So any 40-year-old who walks
in the door wanting insurance,

00:21:57.940 --> 00:21:59.410
you have to sell it to them,
and you to sell it to them

00:21:59.410 --> 00:22:00.905
at a fixed 40-year-old price.

00:22:00.905 --> 00:22:02.030
You can't say, you're sick.

00:22:02.030 --> 00:22:03.363
I'm not going to sell it to you.

00:22:05.290 --> 00:22:07.920
So the first step is to
ban insurer discrimination,

00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:10.290
to try to solve that problem.

00:22:10.290 --> 00:22:15.010
Now the problem this
raises is you have simply--

00:22:15.010 --> 00:22:18.420
if you do this alone, you've
created a new problem, which

00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:21.750
is if you tell insurers
they can't discriminate

00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:24.560
against the sick, you don't
solve the adverse selection

00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:25.060
problem.

00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:28.630
You're just making
insurers go bankrupt.

00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:30.910
Now here's the way I
like to think of it.

00:22:30.910 --> 00:22:33.200
I'm sure none of you
ever gambled on sports.

00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:35.480
But if you had
gambled on sports,

00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:38.080
you might know the way
sports gambling works is

00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:40.540
that there's a guy in the
middle, called the bookie.

00:22:40.540 --> 00:22:43.120
And the bookie's
goal is to not--

00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:46.810
is to get exactly the same
number of bets on either team.

00:22:46.810 --> 00:22:51.900
So they take no risk, and just
make their profits off the top.

00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:54.500
So what bookies do is
they set point spreads.

00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:57.305
So the Patriots played the
Dolphins this past weekend.

00:22:57.305 --> 00:22:59.515
I am-- sadly, I'm
a Dolphins fan.

00:22:59.515 --> 00:23:00.890
The Patriots played
the Dolphins.

00:23:00.890 --> 00:23:02.150
The point spread was
something like-- does

00:23:02.150 --> 00:23:03.470
anyone know what the spread
was in the Patriots' game?

00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:05.230
I think is was, like, 8 points.

00:23:05.230 --> 00:23:06.940
So that spread was chosen.

00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:08.260
The Patriots were favored by 8.

00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:11.230
What that meant was
your bet was either

00:23:11.230 --> 00:23:15.380
the Patriots win by either
more, or the Dolphins win,

00:23:15.380 --> 00:23:17.452
or the Patriots win by
8, or by less than 8.

00:23:17.452 --> 00:23:19.160
So one side is Patriots
win by 8 or more.

00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:22.190
One side is Patriots win by
less than 8, or Dolphins win.

00:23:22.190 --> 00:23:23.930
And the reason you
have that bias thing

00:23:23.930 --> 00:23:25.930
is because people think
the Patriots are better.

00:23:25.930 --> 00:23:26.710
They are better.

00:23:26.710 --> 00:23:28.880
And as a result,
you want to get--

00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:31.005
if you set an even bet,
Patriots win, Dolphins win,

00:23:31.005 --> 00:23:32.463
everyone would bet
on the Patriots.

00:23:32.463 --> 00:23:33.200
You'd lose money.

00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:35.225
So you want an equal
distribution of risks.

00:23:35.225 --> 00:23:37.100
So what you want is you
want to set the point

00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:38.960
spread so the distribution
of risk is equal.

00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:41.460
Then having done that, you just
make your money off the top.

00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:45.950
Now imagine I passed a law
which said all sports books have

00:23:45.950 --> 00:23:49.580
to reopen at halftime and make
the same bets available they

00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:51.343
made before the game started.

00:23:51.343 --> 00:23:53.510
Well, for those of you who
watched the exciting game

00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:54.710
this weekend, you
realized at halftime,

00:23:54.710 --> 00:23:55.970
it became pretty obvious
the Patriots weren't

00:23:55.970 --> 00:23:58.047
going to win by 8, that
it was a lot closer game

00:23:58.047 --> 00:23:58.880
than people thought.

00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:00.920
So if they reopen
that, a bunch of people

00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:03.353
would suddenly bet
against the Patriots.

00:24:03.353 --> 00:24:05.270
The Patriots ended up
losing, and the insurers

00:24:05.270 --> 00:24:08.980
would have gone bankrupt-- the
bookie would've gone bankrupt.

00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:10.960
Insurers are just bookies.

00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:12.160
That's all they are.

00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:14.285
They just want a predictable
distribution of risks.

00:24:14.285 --> 00:24:16.577
So if you tell them, you have
to offer health insurance

00:24:16.577 --> 00:24:18.730
to everyone for the
same price, but only

00:24:18.730 --> 00:24:22.377
the sick are going to buy,
they're going to lose money.

00:24:22.377 --> 00:24:24.710
So that's why we need the
second leg of the stool, which

00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:27.800
I talked about last time, which
was the individual mandate.

00:24:32.330 --> 00:24:34.430
The individual mandate,
which is to say,

00:24:34.430 --> 00:24:37.100
OK, insurers, if you offer
health insurance to everyone

00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:40.550
at a fair price, we will,
as our part of the deal,

00:24:40.550 --> 00:24:42.560
make sure everyone
buys health insurance.

00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:44.810
So when the 40-year-old walks
into your office wanting

00:24:44.810 --> 00:24:47.060
insurance, you can know it's
not because they're sick.

00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:49.440
It's just because they have to.

00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:51.780
So we say to insurers, you
price insurance fairly,

00:24:51.780 --> 00:24:53.598
and in return, we'll
make sure you get

00:24:53.598 --> 00:24:54.890
the fair distribution of risks.

00:24:54.890 --> 00:24:57.060
So you say to me--
my MIT insurance,

00:24:57.060 --> 00:24:58.750
you price insurance
at $1,500 and don't

00:24:58.750 --> 00:25:01.230
try to keep out the sick,
I'll make sure everyone buys.

00:25:01.230 --> 00:25:03.930
And you'll make
your $100 profit.

00:25:03.930 --> 00:25:06.970
So that's-- the mandate was
essentially trying to bring--

00:25:06.970 --> 00:25:09.860
was trying to allow--
get rid of discrimination

00:25:09.860 --> 00:25:11.600
by bringing in the
entire pool of people

00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:14.532
so insurers could fairly price.

00:25:14.532 --> 00:25:16.990
The problem with that is you
can't mandate something people

00:25:16.990 --> 00:25:19.043
can't afford.

00:25:19.043 --> 00:25:20.460
So in Massachusetts,
where we were

00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:21.940
creating this plan
in the mid 2000s,

00:25:21.940 --> 00:25:23.690
the typical family
health insurance policy

00:25:23.690 --> 00:25:25.770
was about $12,000 a year.

00:25:25.770 --> 00:25:28.833
The poverty line for a
family was $22,000 a year.

00:25:28.833 --> 00:25:30.250
We couldn't exactly
mandate people

00:25:30.250 --> 00:25:32.458
that they spend 55% percent
of their income on health

00:25:32.458 --> 00:25:33.000
insurance.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:34.830
That was not really feasible.

00:25:34.830 --> 00:25:37.140
So the third leg of the
stool we came up with

00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:41.100
is subsidies to make health
insurance affordable,

00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:43.710
saying, if you're
low-income, we will offset

00:25:43.710 --> 00:25:47.820
the cost of your insurance just
like the subsidy approach here.

00:25:47.820 --> 00:25:49.560
We'll offset the cost
of your insurance

00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:50.510
to make it more affordable.

00:25:50.510 --> 00:25:52.170
We'll do it on an
income-related basis,

00:25:52.170 --> 00:25:53.790
so it doesn't cost so much.

00:25:53.790 --> 00:25:54.930
So we're not going to
have to pay for everyone's

00:25:54.930 --> 00:25:56.240
insurance like single payer.

00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:58.140
Remember, single payer,
essentially taking

00:25:58.140 --> 00:26:01.050
someone like me, who's
happy with my insurance,

00:26:01.050 --> 00:26:03.040
swapping it out for new
government insurance.

00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:05.373
This is saying, no, if you're
happy with your insurance,

00:26:05.373 --> 00:26:06.600
stick with your insurance.

00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:09.780
But if you're low-income and
can't access the employer

00:26:09.780 --> 00:26:13.260
market, this gives
you a new place to go.

00:26:13.260 --> 00:26:15.840
And that was the idea
that became Romneycare,

00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:18.360
the plan here in Massachusetts,
and eventually then became

00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:21.670
Obamacare, or the
Affordable Care Act.

00:26:21.670 --> 00:26:25.470
So this is essentially
the idea of that plan.

00:26:25.470 --> 00:26:27.900
Now, did it work?

00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:29.070
Unambiguously, yes.

00:26:29.070 --> 00:26:30.612
Now you won't find
anyone more biased

00:26:30.612 --> 00:26:31.800
than me on this question.

00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:33.210
But I think what--

00:26:33.210 --> 00:26:36.050
I think if I've tried to teach
you one thing in this class,

00:26:36.050 --> 00:26:39.040
it's that we need to rely on
real facts wherever possible.

00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:40.770
And if not, we could
turn to theory.

00:26:40.770 --> 00:26:44.340
But here we have a set of real
facts that we can turn to,

00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:46.050
which is that
essentially what we

00:26:46.050 --> 00:26:48.750
did in Massachusetts with this
law is we covered about 2/3

00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:50.970
of the uninsured population.

00:26:50.970 --> 00:26:54.600
At the federal level,
we covered about 45%

00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:56.190
of the uninsured population.

00:26:56.190 --> 00:26:58.500
It was a lower number because
the federal law did not

00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:00.313
apply to undocumented
immigrants, which

00:27:00.313 --> 00:27:01.855
are about a quarter
of the uninsured.

00:27:01.855 --> 00:27:03.313
It's not an issue
in Massachusetts,

00:27:03.313 --> 00:27:05.020
but a big issue in other places.

00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:06.090
That's about a quarter
of the uninsured

00:27:06.090 --> 00:27:06.960
because the federal
law did not apply

00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:08.570
to undocumented immigrants.

00:27:08.570 --> 00:27:10.320
So as a result, the
share cover was lower.

00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:11.737
But a large number
aren't covered.

00:27:11.737 --> 00:27:12.480
Yeah.

00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:14.930
AUDIENCE: If there was
an initial mandate, then

00:27:14.930 --> 00:27:16.847
how was there anyone
who was left uninsured?

00:27:16.847 --> 00:27:18.180
JONATHAN GRUBER: Great question.

00:27:18.180 --> 00:27:20.752
So there are three reasons why
people were left uninsured.

00:27:20.752 --> 00:27:22.710
The first reason was a
quarter of the uninsured

00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:24.418
were undocumented
immigrants, and the law

00:27:24.418 --> 00:27:26.140
didn't apply to them.

00:27:26.140 --> 00:27:29.220
So right now the upper bound
was 75%, just to start.

00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:32.370
The second reason is that the
individual mandate contained

00:27:32.370 --> 00:27:35.310
exemptions to make it both a
little more humane and, quite

00:27:35.310 --> 00:27:36.930
frankly, politically feasible.

00:27:36.930 --> 00:27:39.150
So if you could not
get-- if your income was

00:27:39.150 --> 00:27:40.650
below the poverty
line, you were not

00:27:40.650 --> 00:27:42.450
subject to the
individual mandate.

00:27:42.450 --> 00:27:45.030
And if you could not get
insurance for less than 8%

00:27:45.030 --> 00:27:46.530
of your income, you
were not subject

00:27:46.530 --> 00:27:48.000
to the individual mandate.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:49.503
So there were exemptions.

00:27:49.503 --> 00:27:51.420
And the third thing was
the individual mandate

00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:53.420
was not, like, we're going
to throw you in jail.

00:27:53.420 --> 00:27:54.630
It was a tax penalty.

00:27:54.630 --> 00:27:57.090
And many people decided they'd
rather just pay the penalty

00:27:57.090 --> 00:27:58.323
than buy health insurance.

00:27:58.323 --> 00:28:00.240
So for those three
reasons, a number of people

00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:02.915
did not get health insurance
under the Affordable Care Act.

00:28:02.915 --> 00:28:04.790
Now there's a bunch of
interesting questions,

00:28:04.790 --> 00:28:06.030
like should the mandate
penalty be bigger?

00:28:06.030 --> 00:28:06.810
How should we handle that?

00:28:06.810 --> 00:28:07.560
There's a lot of--

00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:09.030
I could go for hours on this.

00:28:09.030 --> 00:28:12.330
But that's basically the
structure of what we had.

00:28:12.330 --> 00:28:14.225
So basically, that worked.

00:28:14.225 --> 00:28:15.850
It didn't get us to
universal coverage.

00:28:15.850 --> 00:28:17.970
It wasn't as effective as
single payer would have been,

00:28:17.970 --> 00:28:19.710
but it was the largest
single insurance

00:28:19.710 --> 00:28:21.387
expansion in American history.

00:28:21.387 --> 00:28:22.470
And the evidence is clear.

00:28:22.470 --> 00:28:24.140
It brought many
people into insurance.

00:28:24.140 --> 00:28:25.807
It improved people's
use of health care.

00:28:25.807 --> 00:28:27.160
It improved health.

00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:32.650
So basically, that was kind
of the step forward on access.

00:28:32.650 --> 00:28:35.380
Now the problem with
this is it's only a step.

00:28:35.380 --> 00:28:37.450
There's still many
uninsured, and this

00:28:37.450 --> 00:28:42.250
has been politically really
challenging, because these two

00:28:42.250 --> 00:28:43.780
answers are quite simple.

00:28:43.780 --> 00:28:46.000
Just give people money or
just have single payer.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:47.260
This is super complicated.

00:28:47.260 --> 00:28:49.270
I can talk about these
in about 15 seconds each.

00:28:49.270 --> 00:28:51.812
These took five
minutes to go through.

00:28:51.812 --> 00:28:53.770
And people thought it
was just too complicated.

00:28:53.770 --> 00:28:54.675
It didn't make sense.

00:28:54.675 --> 00:28:56.800
Lots of reasons-- we could
talk lots reasons people

00:28:56.800 --> 00:28:57.645
didn't like it.

00:28:57.645 --> 00:28:59.770
So it's never really been
as politically successful

00:28:59.770 --> 00:29:01.780
as people like myself,
who helped develop it,

00:29:01.780 --> 00:29:02.830
would have hoped.

00:29:02.830 --> 00:29:04.723
And it's left a lot
of people uninsured.

00:29:04.723 --> 00:29:06.390
So we haven't solved
the access problem.

00:29:06.390 --> 00:29:09.760
We made a big step forward,
but we haven't solved it.

00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:13.110
And that's the ongoing debate
today we see, particularly

00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:14.383
in the Democratic Party.

00:29:14.383 --> 00:29:16.300
The Republican Party
really doesn't focus much

00:29:16.300 --> 00:29:17.560
on insurance coverage.

00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:19.250
But the Democratic Party does.

00:29:19.250 --> 00:29:21.970
And they're-- that's why there's
a lot of energy behind single

00:29:21.970 --> 00:29:25.000
payer right now is like, look,
you tried the kind of halfway

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:26.050
ground.

00:29:26.050 --> 00:29:28.435
That kind of worked, but
didn't work all the way.

00:29:28.435 --> 00:29:30.310
So let's just go all
the way to single payer.

00:29:30.310 --> 00:29:32.110
Yeah.

00:29:32.110 --> 00:29:33.860
AUDIENCE: The initial
mandate, does that--

00:29:33.860 --> 00:29:35.318
I guess, for the
more people living

00:29:35.318 --> 00:29:37.763
in poverty, does that work
together with Medicaid or--

00:29:37.763 --> 00:29:38.680
JONATHAN GRUBER: Yeah.

00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:41.140
Basically, a lot-- actually,
it's quite interesting.

00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:42.598
It worked quite
well with Medicaid.

00:29:42.598 --> 00:29:44.200
A lot of people
who aren't insured,

00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:45.700
actually, are people
who are already

00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:47.260
eligible for free
Medicaid coverage

00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:48.970
and just don't take it.

00:29:48.970 --> 00:29:50.650
Now we don't quite know why.

00:29:50.650 --> 00:29:51.940
It could be language barriers.

00:29:51.940 --> 00:29:53.200
They don't understand.

00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:55.715
A lot of people-- a lot
of even legal immigrants

00:29:55.715 --> 00:29:57.340
just don't understand
they're eligible.

00:29:57.340 --> 00:29:59.560
It could be people just don't
want a government handout.

00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:01.030
They're embarrassed taking
help from the government.

00:30:01.030 --> 00:30:02.590
It could be people
think, I don't need it.

00:30:02.590 --> 00:30:03.760
I'm never going to be sick.

00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:04.792
We don't know why.

00:30:04.792 --> 00:30:06.250
So part of what
the mandate did was

00:30:06.250 --> 00:30:08.333
say, look, you already
have free health insurance.

00:30:08.333 --> 00:30:09.790
Just pay attention and take it.

00:30:09.790 --> 00:30:12.370
That's part of the effect it
had was bringing people in.

00:30:12.370 --> 00:30:14.650
So a large part of
the coverage increase

00:30:14.650 --> 00:30:17.233
is actually bringing in people
who were already eligible, just

00:30:17.233 --> 00:30:19.810
weren't taking it up before.

00:30:19.810 --> 00:30:21.670
So that's kind of where we are.

00:30:21.670 --> 00:30:23.060
So where we stand
now in coverage

00:30:23.060 --> 00:30:25.840
is we've taken a
giant step forward.

00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:28.090
We've covered probably
about now, probably,

00:30:28.090 --> 00:30:31.780
between a third and 40% of
the uninsured in America.

00:30:31.780 --> 00:30:35.500
But we're sort of right now
kind of stuck at that point.

00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:39.280
And the question is, do we
just sort of stick there,

00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:40.990
or do we try something
more aggressive?

00:30:40.990 --> 00:30:42.740
With the political
problems, I don't know.

00:30:42.740 --> 00:30:45.320
But that's going to be the
challenge going forward.

00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:47.887
So that's-- questions
about that--

00:30:47.887 --> 00:30:49.970
because that's where we
are on problem number one,

00:30:49.970 --> 00:30:52.010
which is access in coverage.

00:30:52.010 --> 00:30:55.025
Now let's turn to problem
number two, which is cost.

00:30:58.160 --> 00:31:00.140
Cost is way harder.

00:31:00.140 --> 00:31:02.983
What I just did
was the easy part.

00:31:02.983 --> 00:31:04.900
It's way harder to get
your health care costs,

00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:06.560
and here's why.

00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:09.380
Two facts that are seemingly
contradicted if you

00:31:09.380 --> 00:31:10.720
think about it.

00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:12.400
Fact one.

00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:15.910
Since 1950, US
spending on health

00:31:15.910 --> 00:31:19.330
care as a share of our
economy has quadrupled.

00:31:19.330 --> 00:31:21.400
We've gone from--
more than quadrupled.

00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:25.740
We've gone from 4% of our GDP
being health care to over 17%.

00:31:25.740 --> 00:31:28.250
And it's been worth it.

00:31:28.250 --> 00:31:31.070
If you look at the
improvements in our health,

00:31:31.070 --> 00:31:33.290
and you value them in
the way economists do,

00:31:33.290 --> 00:31:36.105
which is we have statistical
values of life we apply,

00:31:36.105 --> 00:31:38.450
or statistical values in
improvement in health,

00:31:38.450 --> 00:31:40.220
the improvement
in our health has

00:31:40.220 --> 00:31:42.427
been worth the money
spent on health care.

00:31:42.427 --> 00:31:43.510
You guys don't realize it.

00:31:43.510 --> 00:31:47.210
Health care totally
sucked in 1950.

00:31:47.210 --> 00:31:50.090
Babies born in 1950 were
four times as likely

00:31:50.090 --> 00:31:52.130
to die before they reached
their first birthday.

00:31:52.130 --> 00:31:54.153
If you had a heart
attack in 1950,

00:31:54.153 --> 00:31:56.570
you were four times likelier
to die within the first year.

00:31:56.570 --> 00:31:59.060
To put it in terms all young
healthy people care about,

00:31:59.060 --> 00:32:02.890
if you hurt your knee skiing
in 1950, tore your ACL in 1950,

00:32:02.890 --> 00:32:05.503
or tore your cartilage, you
were in the hospital for a week.

00:32:05.503 --> 00:32:06.920
You were on crutches
for six weeks

00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:08.757
and had arthritis the
rest of your life.

00:32:08.757 --> 00:32:10.340
Today, you go to an
outpatient center.

00:32:10.340 --> 00:32:11.548
You get arthroscopic surgery.

00:32:11.548 --> 00:32:14.020
You're back on the slopes
a couple weeks later.

00:32:14.020 --> 00:32:17.390
Health care is just way better,
and our health is way better.

00:32:17.390 --> 00:32:22.250
America is a much better off
nation, spending 17% of GDP

00:32:22.250 --> 00:32:25.790
on health with how healthy
we are than we were in 1950.

00:32:25.790 --> 00:32:27.770
And once again, do
the economists tests.

00:32:27.770 --> 00:32:30.330
No one ever advertises, hey,
would you like 1950s health

00:32:30.330 --> 00:32:32.850
care at 1950s prices?

00:32:32.850 --> 00:32:36.190
No one out there is offering
that because it's worth it.

00:32:36.190 --> 00:32:37.800
That's fact one.

00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:42.070
Fact two is we waste a huge
amount of money on health care.

00:32:42.070 --> 00:32:44.740
By some estimates, about a third
of what we spend on health care

00:32:44.740 --> 00:32:49.130
is totally wasteful, does
nothing to improve our health.

00:32:49.130 --> 00:32:51.280
Now how can those two
facts be consistent?

00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:53.620
It's worth it,
but it's wasteful.

00:32:53.620 --> 00:32:58.560
Well, the answer is that the
other 2/3 is super awesome,

00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:00.915
that basically the
increase in health care,

00:33:00.915 --> 00:33:02.790
where it's been productive,
has been amazing.

00:33:02.790 --> 00:33:06.668
But we dragged along all this
unproductive spending too.

00:33:06.668 --> 00:33:07.960
So it's good news and bad news.

00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:09.970
So the good news is,
well, that's great.

00:33:09.970 --> 00:33:12.430
We just cut out the one
third that's unproductive,

00:33:12.430 --> 00:33:14.880
we've solved our problem.

00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:16.630
Literally, if we could
just simply cut out

00:33:16.630 --> 00:33:17.470
the one third
that's unproductive,

00:33:17.470 --> 00:33:19.845
we'd spend the same amount as
Europe does on health care.

00:33:19.845 --> 00:33:22.750
We'd solve our entire
long-run fiscal problem.

00:33:22.750 --> 00:33:25.750
The bad news is that it's
easy to look back and see

00:33:25.750 --> 00:33:27.580
what the one third was.

00:33:27.580 --> 00:33:31.110
It's hard to look forward and
say what it's going to be,

00:33:31.110 --> 00:33:33.740
that health care comes with
a huge amount of uncertainty

00:33:33.740 --> 00:33:36.850
about what's going to work and
what's going to be worth it.

00:33:36.850 --> 00:33:40.352
And as a result, it is
very hard to say, OK, fine.

00:33:40.352 --> 00:33:41.060
We'll cover this.

00:33:41.060 --> 00:33:42.620
We won't cover
that, because it's

00:33:42.620 --> 00:33:45.970
hard to know what's going
to work and what's not.

00:33:45.970 --> 00:33:50.410
And so, essentially, you're
in this very difficult spot.

00:33:50.410 --> 00:33:52.870
So what are the
kind-- that's the sort

00:33:52.870 --> 00:33:55.460
of fundamental
trade-off that we face.

00:33:55.460 --> 00:33:59.810
So what are the potential
solutions to this problem?

00:33:59.810 --> 00:34:04.000
So essentially, there's a
couple of different solutions

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:09.159
to the problem, two different
paths we can follow.

00:34:09.159 --> 00:34:15.600
Path one is the regulatory
path, which is basically

00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:18.500
the path that Europe follows.

00:34:18.500 --> 00:34:21.500
What Europe does is they
just much, much more heavily

00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:24.969
regulate the delivery
of health care.

00:34:24.969 --> 00:34:26.830
And they do that in two ways.

00:34:26.830 --> 00:34:29.610
One is they actually have
regulations about what

00:34:29.610 --> 00:34:31.050
health care you can get.

00:34:31.050 --> 00:34:34.955
So for instance, England has
the euphemistically named NICE,

00:34:34.955 --> 00:34:37.600
the National Institute for
Health and Care Excellence,

00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:40.679
which actually tells people
they can't get some things.

00:34:40.679 --> 00:34:42.570
It literally rations.

00:34:42.570 --> 00:34:44.909
So for example, for many
years-- it's no longer true--

00:34:44.909 --> 00:34:47.675
in England, if you're over 75,
you could not get a transplant.

00:34:47.675 --> 00:34:49.842
They said, look, we got a
limited number of kidneys.

00:34:49.842 --> 00:34:51.300
You're going to die soon anyway.

00:34:51.300 --> 00:34:53.370
Let's give the kidney
to a young person.

00:34:53.370 --> 00:34:55.932
Actually, kind of makes sense.

00:34:55.932 --> 00:34:58.140
The idea is, look, we have
some limit on our kidneys.

00:34:58.140 --> 00:34:59.580
Why should it be determined
by some random fact,

00:34:59.580 --> 00:35:00.490
like when you got on line?

00:35:00.490 --> 00:35:01.948
It should be
determined by who gets

00:35:01.948 --> 00:35:03.540
the most value from the kidney.

00:35:03.540 --> 00:35:07.620
It's going to be someone who's
30, not someone who's 75.

00:35:07.620 --> 00:35:10.515
So one regular route
is to literally

00:35:10.515 --> 00:35:11.640
have regulations like that.

00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:13.860
That's actually pretty rare.

00:35:13.860 --> 00:35:16.717
Most countries don't actually
regulate in that way.

00:35:16.717 --> 00:35:19.050
Most countries kind of let
you get what your doctor says

00:35:19.050 --> 00:35:20.425
you should get.

00:35:20.425 --> 00:35:21.300
There's three routes.

00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:24.340
So one route is
sort of regulatory.

00:35:24.340 --> 00:35:28.090
The other route of regulate--
so one route is sort of what we

00:35:28.090 --> 00:35:32.608
call sort of
regulating, you know--

00:35:32.608 --> 00:35:34.150
I don't want to call
it access-- sort

00:35:34.150 --> 00:35:38.110
of technological regulation,
regulating which technology you

00:35:38.110 --> 00:35:39.070
can get.

00:35:39.070 --> 00:35:44.240
The second kind of regulation
in Europe is supply regulation.

00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:46.420
So they basically don't
let there be many doctors.

00:35:46.420 --> 00:35:49.400
And there are not many
doctors and hospitals.

00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:53.800
So there are as many
MRI machines in LA

00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:56.970
as there are in Canada.

00:35:56.970 --> 00:35:59.680
Basically, just not many place
to go get an MRI in Canada.

00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:02.610
So if you' hurt
your knee in the US,

00:36:02.610 --> 00:36:05.220
you go, you get an MRI,
like, the next day.

00:36:05.220 --> 00:36:08.382
In Canada, you get
it six weeks later.

00:36:08.382 --> 00:36:10.590
So the only way to control
it is to actually regulate

00:36:10.590 --> 00:36:12.150
the supply of medical care.

00:36:12.150 --> 00:36:15.970
Just give people less
stuff they can use.

00:36:15.970 --> 00:36:17.680
And the third way to control--

00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:20.830
the third regulatory mechanism,
and the most important,

00:36:20.830 --> 00:36:23.600
is price regulation.

00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:26.378
We are the only nation in
the world which essentially

00:36:26.378 --> 00:36:28.670
lets the free market determine
the price of health care

00:36:28.670 --> 00:36:30.680
services.

00:36:30.680 --> 00:36:33.260
Every other nation
regulates the prices

00:36:33.260 --> 00:36:35.970
that people pay for their
health care services.

00:36:35.970 --> 00:36:39.388
Now the question we
have to ask is why?

00:36:39.388 --> 00:36:40.430
Why does that make sense?

00:36:40.430 --> 00:36:42.940
Well, the answer would
be that we think--

00:36:42.940 --> 00:36:45.440
it would make sense if we think
there's a fundamental market

00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:49.480
failure in the determination
of health care prices.

00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:51.263
And in fact, it
turns out there are

00:36:51.263 --> 00:36:53.680
numbers of market failures in
determination of health care

00:36:53.680 --> 00:36:55.110
prices.

00:36:55.110 --> 00:36:57.240
So one market
failure, for example,

00:36:57.240 --> 00:36:59.310
is imperfect information.

00:36:59.310 --> 00:37:00.480
I don't know--

00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:01.980
I can't shop
effectively-- when I'm

00:37:01.980 --> 00:37:03.940
in the back of the ambulance
dying from a heart attack,

00:37:03.940 --> 00:37:05.880
I can't be, like, you know
that hospital looks expensive.

00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:06.570
Take me over there.

00:37:06.570 --> 00:37:07.470
I want to shop there.

00:37:07.470 --> 00:37:08.940
You can't really shop.

00:37:08.940 --> 00:37:10.240
It's a hard market to shop.

00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:11.970
And if you could,
prices aren't posted.

00:37:11.970 --> 00:37:13.440
You don't really
know what it costs

00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:15.648
to get your heart attack
treated in different places.

00:37:15.648 --> 00:37:17.330
So imperfect information.

00:37:17.330 --> 00:37:19.620
There's also
imperfect competition,

00:37:19.620 --> 00:37:22.687
which is if you have your
heart attack on Cape Cod,

00:37:22.687 --> 00:37:23.520
there's, like, one--

00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:25.520
or Nantucket, which is
an island, with no way

00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:27.660
off but a ferry,
there's one place to go.

00:37:27.660 --> 00:37:29.030
There's one hospital.

00:37:29.030 --> 00:37:31.762
They have a perfect monopoly.

00:37:31.762 --> 00:37:32.970
You can't get off the island.

00:37:32.970 --> 00:37:34.640
You're going to die otherwise.

00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:36.120
So it's imperfect competition.

00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:37.230
There's even
imperfect competition

00:37:37.230 --> 00:37:39.272
where you think the
competition might be perfect.

00:37:39.272 --> 00:37:40.987
So take Boston.

00:37:40.987 --> 00:37:42.570
There are so many
hospitals in Boston,

00:37:42.570 --> 00:37:46.320
you cannot literally fall down
without hitting a hospital.

00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:49.390
Yet there is an
enormous dispersion

00:37:49.390 --> 00:37:50.700
in the prices hospitals charge.

00:37:50.700 --> 00:37:52.980
In particular, the
very famous hospitals,

00:37:52.980 --> 00:37:54.930
like Mass General
Hospital, charge

00:37:54.930 --> 00:37:57.870
multiples of what less
famous hospitals charge,

00:37:57.870 --> 00:38:00.600
even though less famous
hospitals are really nearby.

00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:01.450
Why?

00:38:01.450 --> 00:38:02.908
Well, because they
have essentially

00:38:02.908 --> 00:38:05.366
what we call a reputational
monopoly, that even though they

00:38:05.366 --> 00:38:07.700
don't have an actual physical
monopoly, people are like,

00:38:07.700 --> 00:38:08.550
I want to go to MGH.

00:38:08.550 --> 00:38:10.160
They're the best, even if
they're not necessarily

00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:10.580
the best.

00:38:10.580 --> 00:38:12.310
They just have this
view of being the best.

00:38:12.310 --> 00:38:14.090
And they can charge
higher prices as a result,

00:38:14.090 --> 00:38:16.010
even if their outcomes
aren't necessarily better.

00:38:16.010 --> 00:38:17.810
In other markets, we
think perfect information

00:38:17.810 --> 00:38:20.268
would allow us to get rid of
these kinds of inefficiencies.

00:38:20.268 --> 00:38:22.490
It doesn't exist in health care.

00:38:22.490 --> 00:38:25.310
As a result, perfect
competition simply

00:38:25.310 --> 00:38:28.530
does not work in
health price setting.

00:38:28.530 --> 00:38:31.190
And as a result,
all other countries

00:38:31.190 --> 00:38:33.690
regulate health care prices--
and then not other countries--

00:38:33.690 --> 00:38:35.610
even the US can
regulate health prices.

00:38:35.610 --> 00:38:39.020
So the Medicare program
has regulated prices.

00:38:39.020 --> 00:38:40.460
That covers millions
of Americans.

00:38:40.460 --> 00:38:42.860
It's just for the
non-government, private health

00:38:42.860 --> 00:38:46.350
insurance in the US, there's
non-regulated prices.

00:38:46.350 --> 00:38:51.510
Now I am not, despite my tone,
saying that regulating prices

00:38:51.510 --> 00:38:53.160
is the answer.

00:38:53.160 --> 00:38:54.230
It's not clear.

00:38:54.230 --> 00:38:56.180
Regulating prices comes
with a huge number

00:38:56.180 --> 00:38:58.220
of additional problems
like we talked about.

00:38:58.220 --> 00:39:00.050
We talked about
regulated monopolies,

00:39:00.050 --> 00:39:03.968
which is the government may not
know the proper price to set.

00:39:03.968 --> 00:39:05.510
The government may
do a terrible job.

00:39:05.510 --> 00:39:06.385
They may get lobbied.

00:39:06.385 --> 00:39:08.160
They may be corrupt.

00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:10.650
Indeed, in the US, the
1970s, virtually every state

00:39:10.650 --> 00:39:12.492
did regulate hospital prices.

00:39:12.492 --> 00:39:13.950
And every state
went away from that

00:39:13.950 --> 00:39:16.145
because they thought
the system was broken.

00:39:16.145 --> 00:39:17.770
So it's not like
there's any-- it's not

00:39:17.770 --> 00:39:20.330
like the European
solution's an easy answer.

00:39:20.330 --> 00:39:23.600
That's why the other route that
people have been pushing lately

00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:29.150
is a different route, which
is the incentives route, which

00:39:29.150 --> 00:39:31.280
is basically to say,
look, we don't want

00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:32.810
to regulate supply or prices.

00:39:32.810 --> 00:39:34.352
What we're going to
do is we're going

00:39:34.352 --> 00:39:37.130
to say, doctors and
hospitals, you get together

00:39:37.130 --> 00:39:39.200
and form these units we
call Accountable Care

00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:41.995
Organizations, ACOs.

00:39:41.995 --> 00:39:44.120
This is a big innovation
of the Affordable Care Act

00:39:44.120 --> 00:39:46.490
of Obamacare, set up these ACOs.

00:39:46.490 --> 00:39:48.720
These are hospitals and
doctors all get together

00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:50.330
to be basically,
like, soup to nuts,

00:39:50.330 --> 00:39:53.210
all the health care
you need in one group.

00:39:53.210 --> 00:39:56.060
And we say to them, we are
going to pay you one flat amount

00:39:56.060 --> 00:39:59.740
of money to care for Jon.

00:39:59.740 --> 00:40:02.110
And then within that,
you decide what he gets.

00:40:02.110 --> 00:40:04.300
You decide what prices
everybody pays and makes.

00:40:04.300 --> 00:40:05.490
You figure all that out.

00:40:05.490 --> 00:40:07.240
But we're going to
give you a flat amount.

00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:10.737
In particular, that flat amount
is not going to rise much.

00:40:10.737 --> 00:40:12.820
And that's going to bring
the costs of health care

00:40:12.820 --> 00:40:15.370
under control, where
basically every ACO will

00:40:15.370 --> 00:40:18.470
get an amount that's
a flat amount,

00:40:18.470 --> 00:40:20.827
and it just won't rise much.

00:40:20.827 --> 00:40:22.410
And that's how we'll
bring health care

00:40:22.410 --> 00:40:24.190
costs under control.

00:40:24.190 --> 00:40:26.590
That has a number of
wonderful features.

00:40:26.590 --> 00:40:28.000
First of all, it's
much less evil

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:30.250
sounding than things like
not letting [INAUDIBLE] rise

00:40:30.250 --> 00:40:32.865
or regulating what prices.

00:40:32.865 --> 00:40:34.990
Second of all, there's much
fewer regulatory tools.

00:40:34.990 --> 00:40:37.073
We just say, here's a flat
amount we're giving you

00:40:37.073 --> 00:40:40.150
per person, and we're done.

00:40:40.150 --> 00:40:41.420
So that sounds great.

00:40:41.420 --> 00:40:44.450
The problem is we haven't
been able to get it to work.

00:40:44.450 --> 00:40:46.950
And that's because it turns out
doctors and hospitals aren't

00:40:46.950 --> 00:40:49.110
very good at figuring out how
to set prices and set supplies.

00:40:49.110 --> 00:40:50.527
They're just not--
they don't know

00:40:50.527 --> 00:40:51.970
how to really figure this out.

00:40:51.970 --> 00:40:54.460
And the ACOs so far have not
actually performed very well.

00:40:54.460 --> 00:40:56.847
They've not saved much money.

00:40:56.847 --> 00:40:58.680
So really, we're stuck
between a route which

00:40:58.680 --> 00:41:00.450
seems a lot easier but we
haven't really figured out

00:41:00.450 --> 00:41:01.980
how to make work,
and a route which

00:41:01.980 --> 00:41:04.830
has worked all around the
world but seems politically

00:41:04.830 --> 00:41:06.680
nightmarish.

00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:08.660
And that's kind of
where we are right now

00:41:08.660 --> 00:41:10.188
in terms of controlling costs.

00:41:10.188 --> 00:41:12.230
And that difficulty is
what we find ourselves in.

00:41:12.230 --> 00:41:15.680
But let me be clear.

00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:18.170
This is not like, oh, that's
very interesting, Jon.

00:41:18.170 --> 00:41:19.850
I'll go home and
forget about it now.

00:41:19.850 --> 00:41:22.210
This is the entire future.

00:41:22.210 --> 00:41:24.650
Health care costs are
the key to determine

00:41:24.650 --> 00:41:26.480
the entire fiscal
future of the US.

00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:30.110
As I mentioned last
lecture, the US

00:41:30.110 --> 00:41:33.320
is currently estimated about
$75 trillion in deficit

00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:34.980
over the long run.

00:41:34.980 --> 00:41:39.070
$70 trillion of
that is health care.

00:41:39.070 --> 00:41:41.050
Health care is the
single determinant

00:41:41.050 --> 00:41:43.300
of the US fiscal
balance in the long run.

00:41:43.300 --> 00:41:45.910
Literally, it's the single most
important government problem

00:41:45.910 --> 00:41:48.160
facing-- health care cost
is the single most important

00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:49.868
government problem
facing your generation

00:41:49.868 --> 00:41:50.890
and the next generation.

00:41:50.890 --> 00:41:52.210
I like to say that all
that matters when we think

00:41:52.210 --> 00:41:53.840
about the future
is health care cost

00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:57.070
and global warming because
either way we're under water.

00:41:57.070 --> 00:41:58.930
Basically, those are
the two big issues

00:41:58.930 --> 00:42:00.590
we have to face going forward.

00:42:00.590 --> 00:42:03.220
So this is a serious issue
that your generation is going

00:42:03.220 --> 00:42:04.870
to have to struggle with--

00:42:04.870 --> 00:42:08.300
sorry-- as you go on.

00:42:08.300 --> 00:42:11.980
So that's health care
in the US in 40 minutes.

00:42:11.980 --> 00:42:14.860
So this class--
you know, there's

00:42:14.860 --> 00:42:16.660
a famous skit from
Saturday Night

00:42:16.660 --> 00:42:19.770
Live, which is what you remember
five years after college.

00:42:19.770 --> 00:42:24.100
And it's five minutes, and 3
and 1/2 minutes of spring break.

00:42:24.100 --> 00:42:26.740
I don't expect you to remember
the formula for-- if you're not

00:42:26.740 --> 00:42:28.282
going on in economics,
I don't expect

00:42:28.282 --> 00:42:32.730
you to remember the formula
for deriving cost function.

00:42:32.730 --> 00:42:34.480
What I expect you to
get out of this class

00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:35.680
is A, an interest in economics.

00:42:35.680 --> 00:42:36.730
And I hope you'll go on.

00:42:36.730 --> 00:42:37.660
I sincerely hope that.

00:42:37.660 --> 00:42:39.230
And I'm available
to anyone who wants

00:42:39.230 --> 00:42:41.620
to talk about the pros and
cons of going on in economics.

00:42:41.620 --> 00:42:42.880
Obviously, I'm more pro.

00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:44.770
But I'm happy to talk about it.

00:42:44.770 --> 00:42:46.897
So always feel free to
reach out about that.

00:42:46.897 --> 00:42:48.730
But B, even if you don't
go on in economics,

00:42:48.730 --> 00:42:50.730
I want this to make you
a more educated consumer

00:42:50.730 --> 00:42:52.390
of the newspaper.

00:42:52.390 --> 00:42:57.400
This is-- we are in an era, as
I said in my very first lecture,

00:42:57.400 --> 00:43:01.030
where truth and facts
and the scientific method

00:43:01.030 --> 00:43:03.140
are, themselves, under attack.

00:43:03.140 --> 00:43:07.250
And MIT is the last bastion
of fighting this war.

00:43:07.250 --> 00:43:11.320
We are the place that explains
the scientific method, that

00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:12.658
uses the scientific method.

00:43:12.658 --> 00:43:14.200
And we need to use
the methods you've

00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:15.940
learned here to
think intelligently--

00:43:15.940 --> 00:43:18.490
whatever your conclusions--
but to think intelligently

00:43:18.490 --> 00:43:20.770
about these economics topics.

00:43:20.770 --> 00:43:24.295
And fundamentally, that
means being annoying.

00:43:24.295 --> 00:43:26.420
And to illustrate that,
I'd like to end with a joke

00:43:26.420 --> 00:43:28.090
that some of you may have heard.

00:43:28.090 --> 00:43:29.780
Sorry, I apologize if you have.

00:43:29.780 --> 00:43:35.400
So the joke is a doctor, a
priest, and an economist go

00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:36.410
golfing.

00:43:36.410 --> 00:43:38.070
They get on the golf course--

00:43:38.070 --> 00:43:39.120
and they hit the golf
course, and they're

00:43:39.120 --> 00:43:40.810
behind someone going
incredibly slowly.

00:43:40.810 --> 00:43:42.810
I don't know if there are
any golfers among you,

00:43:42.810 --> 00:43:44.480
but the idea is if
you're very slow,

00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:46.050
you're supposed to allow
the people behind you

00:43:46.050 --> 00:43:47.470
to play through and
get ahead of you.

00:43:47.470 --> 00:43:49.220
This person won't let
anyone play through.

00:43:49.220 --> 00:43:50.700
And he's, like, 50 shots a hole.

00:43:50.700 --> 00:43:52.650
It's disgusting.

00:43:52.650 --> 00:43:55.895
And there's, like, 50 people
lined up behind this guy.

00:43:55.895 --> 00:43:57.270
And these folks
are so disgusted,

00:43:57.270 --> 00:43:58.230
they quit after nine holes.

00:43:58.230 --> 00:43:59.070
They go back to the clubhouse.

00:43:59.070 --> 00:44:01.050
They're pounding their
beers like, what an asshole.

00:44:01.050 --> 00:44:02.640
I can't believe he wouldn't
let us play through.

00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:03.580
It ruined our day.

00:44:03.580 --> 00:44:05.622
And someone comes up to
them and says, excuse me,

00:44:05.622 --> 00:44:06.720
are you new to this club?

00:44:06.720 --> 00:44:07.960
And they said, yes, we are.

00:44:07.960 --> 00:44:09.300
He said, well, I can tell
you're new to the club

00:44:09.300 --> 00:44:11.925
because if you weren't new, you
would have known the person you

00:44:11.925 --> 00:44:13.205
were playing behind is blind.

00:44:13.205 --> 00:44:14.830
And actually, it's
a miracle he can get

00:44:14.830 --> 00:44:16.000
the ball in the hole at all.

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:18.690
And usually, it's an honor to
be on the same course as he is.

00:44:18.690 --> 00:44:19.773
And the person walks away.

00:44:19.773 --> 00:44:21.400
And there's, like,
a deadly silence.

00:44:21.400 --> 00:44:23.440
And the people at the
table are like, wow.

00:44:23.440 --> 00:44:24.490
I feel terrible.

00:44:24.490 --> 00:44:25.763
And the doctor goes, I can't--

00:44:25.763 --> 00:44:26.430
I feel terrible.

00:44:26.430 --> 00:44:27.305
I can't believe I'm--

00:44:27.305 --> 00:44:31.190
myself, a man of healing, would
be so insulting towards someone

00:44:31.190 --> 00:44:31.690
who's blind.

00:44:31.690 --> 00:44:34.600
I'm going to dedicate a wing
of my hospital to the blind.

00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:36.057
And he turns to the priest.

00:44:36.057 --> 00:44:37.890
And the priest says, I
can't believe myself,

00:44:37.890 --> 00:44:39.598
a man of the cloth,
and that I'm supposed

00:44:39.598 --> 00:44:43.170
to care for the less able
in society, would do this.

00:44:43.170 --> 00:44:45.750
I'm going to set up a free
soup kitchen for the blind.

00:44:45.750 --> 00:44:46.710
And they turn to the economist.

00:44:46.710 --> 00:44:48.750
And the economist says, well, if
he's blind, why doesn't he just

00:44:48.750 --> 00:44:49.333
play at night?

00:44:52.030 --> 00:44:54.730
And-- makes sense, right?

00:44:54.730 --> 00:44:58.540
And basically, the point is
that the job of the economist

00:44:58.540 --> 00:45:00.730
is to sort of be
annoying and look

00:45:00.730 --> 00:45:04.510
for the basic
flaws in arguments,

00:45:04.510 --> 00:45:07.060
to understand them, to ask
the difficult questions,

00:45:07.060 --> 00:45:08.553
but to have responsible answers.

00:45:08.553 --> 00:45:10.720
And that's what I hope
you'll get out of this course

00:45:10.720 --> 00:45:11.740
that I hope you'll
take forward with you.

00:45:11.740 --> 00:45:13.600
So thank you very much
for sharing it with me.

00:45:13.600 --> 00:45:14.725
And good luck on the final.

00:45:14.725 --> 00:45:17.820

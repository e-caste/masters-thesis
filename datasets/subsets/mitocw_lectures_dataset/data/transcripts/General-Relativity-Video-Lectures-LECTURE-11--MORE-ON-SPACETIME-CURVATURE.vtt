SCOTT HUGHES: So this is
unfortunately a rather sad

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:17.350
lecture, [LAUGHS] since this
will be the last one that

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:19.650
I'm giving to a
live audience here,

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.400
although any of you
who are grad students,

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.670
if you want to come and keep
me company while I'm recording

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:28.200
my next couple of lectures--

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.200
I'm actually not joking.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.992
It's really weird
talking to an empty room,

00:00:30.992 --> 00:00:33.640
and so it might be kind of
nice to at least have a face

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:34.810
to react to.

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:38.920
So I will be recording these,
and making them available.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.920
And per the announcements
that I sent out today,

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.710
there are some
additional assignments

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:45.785
that I've begun posting.

00:00:45.785 --> 00:00:47.410
I've begun putting
things like that up.

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.333
But for the time being,
ignore due dates.

00:00:50.333 --> 00:00:52.000
In fact, I would like
to say, especially

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.880
if you are getting ready
to leave town, just

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.990
ignore the assignments.

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:00.550
There will be updates
posted fairly soon.

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.430
You know, [CHUCKLES]
sometimes-- there's

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:05.820
a saying that Martin
Schmidt, our provost,

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.060
said one time in respect
to a particular initiative

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.460
as it was unwinding, and I
feel like it applies here:

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.055
we're basically sewing together
the parachute after we've

00:01:15.055 --> 00:01:16.180
jumped out of the airplane.

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.570
[CHUCKLES] And so that's kind
of where we are right now,

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.930
and hopefully it'll be assembled
before we hit the ground.

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.220
But we're all kind of figuring
out the way this goes.

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.652
So there will be updates
with respect to assignments

00:01:27.652 --> 00:01:29.110
and things like
that, and you know,

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:30.870
we're just trying
to figure out--

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:32.320
I'll just be
blunt-- how the hell

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.906
we're going to
actually pull this off.

00:01:34.906 --> 00:01:39.210
[LAUGHS] It's not curved enough.

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.790
All right, so let me get
back to where we were.

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:42.630
I want to begin--

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.520
so what we worked
with yesterday was

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.220
we derived this mathematical
object called the Riemann

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.480
curvature tensor.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:52.080
And the way we discussed it was
by thinking about some vector

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.290
that I parallel transported
around a closed loop.

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.410
I chose a parallelogram because
it allowed me to sort of nicely

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:00.450
formulate the mathematics.

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.353
So if I imagine a
parallelogram who's

00:02:02.353 --> 00:02:04.020
got sides that are
sort of close enough,

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.600
that parallel is a
well-defined term,

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.169
and the sides are in two
different directions,

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:12.270
one's of length delta x
in the lambda direction,

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.910
one is a delta x in
the sigma direction,

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.130
when I take this vector all
the way around the loop,

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:18.940
I find the vector has changed.

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.320
It's pointing in a
different direction,

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:25.130
and this describes the way
in which it has sort of moved

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.230
as I go around that loop.

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.070
That object is-- even
though it's created--

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:33.118
it's assembled from the
Christoffel symbols, which

00:02:33.118 --> 00:02:34.910
are not tensor, but
it's done in such a way

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.970
that their nontensorialness
cancels out,

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.270
and this four-index
object R is a tensor.

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:42.710
As you can see,
it involves terms

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:45.740
like derivatives of the
Christoffels and Christoffel

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:46.550
times Christoffel.

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:50.150
So that's where nonlinearity
is going to enter.

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.155
I want to sort of
fairly quickly--

00:02:52.155 --> 00:02:54.530
because I do want to get into
some other stuff that we do

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:55.310
with this--

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.493
talk a bit about the
symmetry of this thing.

00:02:58.493 --> 00:03:00.410
So I discussed last time
how you look at this,

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:02.120
and naively, you
think you've got--

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.328
in four dimensions, four
dimensions, four [INAUDIBLE]

00:03:04.328 --> 00:03:04.828
states.

00:03:04.828 --> 00:03:06.500
It looks like you
have 256 components.

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:12.793
But in fact, there are
quite a few symmetries

00:03:12.793 --> 00:03:14.960
associated with this which
reduces it significantly.

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:16.640
I kind of gave you
the answer last time,

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.920
but let me talk about
where that comes from.

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.340
I'm going to describe a way
to see these symmetries, which

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:23.840
there's a couple
ways you can do it,

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.010
and I'm going to
pick the one that's

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:26.052
essentially the simplest.

00:03:26.052 --> 00:03:27.710
It's perhaps not as--

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:31.670
there's a few ways to do it
that a purist might prefer,

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:33.170
but in the interest
of time, I think

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:34.520
this is sort of the best one.

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:39.320
So the first thing is that
just by inspecting this answer,

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:45.950
you should see that this
object is antisymmetric if you

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:49.150
exchange the final two indices.

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.880
OK, just look at that
formula, switch the indices

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:55.440
sigma and lambda, and
you get a minus sign.

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.440
Physically, that actually
hopefully makes sense,

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.120
because what that is basically
telling you-- remember the way

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.460
we did this, this operation
of parallel transporting

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:02.420
around a parallelogram.

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:05.660
We sort of went along, say,
the lambda direction, then

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:08.015
the sigma, then the
lambda, than the sigma.

00:04:08.015 --> 00:04:09.735
If I exchange
those indices, it's

00:04:09.735 --> 00:04:12.110
kind of like I actually go in
the opposite direction, OK?

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:13.580
I go in the other
direction first.

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:15.650
I go on the sigma
first, then the lambda.

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:19.700
And so this corresponds to
doing this operation, which

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:21.510
I'll remind you is
called a holonomy.

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.978
It corresponds to
reversing direction.

00:04:39.914 --> 00:04:40.650
OK?

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:42.990
So that's a fairly
easy one to say.

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:46.950
The others are a little bit
tougher, and like I said,

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:49.920
what I'm going to do is follow
kind of a shortcut to do this.

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:53.550
One can do it using sort of
the full glory of the Riemann

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:56.490
tensor here, but life gets
a little bit easier for us

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:57.885
if we do the following.

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:07.005
So what you want to do first
is lower the first index.

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:14.400
So what I'm going
to do is look at R,

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:19.740
alpha in the downstairs,
mu lambda sigma.

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:27.520
This is what I get when
I contract, like so.

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:29.020
And then what I'm
going to do is I'm

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:32.330
going to do all of my analysis
that follows in a local Lorentz

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:32.830
frame.

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:41.720
When I go into the
local Lorentz frame,

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:44.840
the metric at a
particular point is

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:46.250
the metric of flat spacetime.

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:47.570
It's the A to mu nu.

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:02.333
My Christoffel
symbols all vanish,

00:06:02.333 --> 00:06:04.000
but you have to be a
little bit careful,

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.490
because the derivatives of
the Christoffel do not vanish,

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:06.990
right?

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:08.532
So one of the key
points is that when

00:06:08.532 --> 00:06:10.680
you go into those
local Lorentz frame,

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:13.840
there is a little bit of
curvature associated with it.

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:15.060
So the derivatives do not--

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:26.780
OK, so the reason I'm
doing this-- like I said,

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:29.570
you actually could do
the little counting

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:32.600
exercise I'm about to go
through with this whole thing.

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:33.828
It's just messy, OK?

00:06:33.828 --> 00:06:35.870
And so this is sort of a
quick way to see the way

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:36.578
it all comes out.

00:06:36.578 --> 00:06:39.625
Because this is a
tensor relationship,

00:06:39.625 --> 00:06:41.000
you are guaranteed
that something

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.430
you conclude in a
convenient reference frame

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:45.050
will hold in all of them, OK?

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:47.055
So it's a nice way to do this.

00:06:47.055 --> 00:06:48.680
Those of you who are
sort of, you know,

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:52.238
particularly purist,
knock yourselves out

00:06:52.238 --> 00:06:54.530
trying to figure out how to
do this sort of in general.

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:58.290
This is adequate for
our purposes here.

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:01.800
So when I go and
I do this, here's

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:06.300
what my all downstairs
Riemann tensor turns into.

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:11.800
I'm going to lose the
Christoffel squared

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:15.820
terms because
Christoffel vanishes,

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:19.930
and the only thing
that is left are

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:24.628
the terms that involve the
derivative of the Christoffel,

00:07:24.628 --> 00:07:26.910
OK?

00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:28.840
Let's do something a
little bit further.

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:34.680
So let's now plug in the
definition of the Christoffel,

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:38.580
and we'll use the metric before
we actually go into the frame,

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:40.897
so that we can sort of
get the form that we

00:07:40.897 --> 00:07:41.730
would get with this.

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:08.700
I should have made myself be a
little bit more careful here.

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:12.560
So I'm going to put LLF on this,
to make it clear that I'm doing

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:14.890
this in a local Lorentz frame.

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:23.540
So I do this in a
local Lorentz frame,

00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:26.450
and what this turns into--
so there's a lot of algebra

00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:27.710
that I'm not writing out.

00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:49.490
This is an alpha, g sigma mu
minus d sigma d mu g alpha

00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:59.370
lambda plus d sigma d
alpha g lambda mu, OK?

00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:02.445
So notice, it is only the
second derivative of the metric

00:09:02.445 --> 00:09:03.570
that is appearing here, OK?

00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:05.958
If I go into the local
Lorentz frame, that's

00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:07.500
the one degree of
freedom we were not

00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:09.522
able to transform away.

00:09:09.522 --> 00:09:11.730
Anything involving the metric
in the first derivative

00:09:11.730 --> 00:09:13.105
dies in this particular frame.

00:09:13.105 --> 00:09:14.730
But this is good
enough for us to begin

00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:17.820
to count up symmetries,
and to see what

00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:19.420
things are going to look like.

00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:24.328
And so I don't have any great
guidance for how to do this.

00:09:24.328 --> 00:09:26.370
This is one of those things
where, literally, you

00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:28.203
just sort of stare at
it for a little while,

00:09:28.203 --> 00:09:32.010
and you see what happens when
you play around with exchanging

00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:35.012
various pairs of indices.

00:09:35.012 --> 00:09:36.220
So stare at this for a while.

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:41.080
OK, so you can see right away--

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:43.680
just for counting
purposes, let me write down

00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:47.010
the one that I argued
was kind of obvious even

00:09:47.010 --> 00:09:48.360
in the full form.

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:51.000
It's the one you get
when you exchange

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.530
the last pairs of indices.

00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:54.120
We'll call that symmetry one.

00:09:57.380 --> 00:10:00.380
Oh, bugger, thank you.

00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:05.030
[CHUCKLES]

00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:05.550
Yeah.

00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:07.100
[CHUCKLES] That's a
good way to-- that's

00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:09.183
a very complicated way of
writing zero, otherwise.

00:10:09.183 --> 00:10:10.670
[LAUGHING]

00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:13.905
All right, if you
exchange the first ones,

00:10:13.905 --> 00:10:15.530
you also-- if you
look at this formula,

00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:17.380
you can see when you
exchange alpha and mu, you

00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:18.140
get a minus sign.

00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:33.190
So one that might be--

00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:35.690
this one takes a little bit of
creativity to sort of see it,

00:10:35.690 --> 00:10:36.640
where it comes out.

00:10:42.250 --> 00:10:45.900
Suppose what I do is I
exchange the first two indices

00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:48.190
for the second two indices.

00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:50.140
Well, it turns out, if
you do that, you just

00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:51.140
get the expression back.

00:10:55.116 --> 00:10:56.110
OK?

00:10:56.110 --> 00:10:59.842
So if I just swap alpha
mu, make them my last two,

00:10:59.842 --> 00:11:01.800
make lambda sigma my
first two, [CLICKS TONGUE]

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:03.450
I get Riemann right back.

00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:04.590
So that's another symmetry.

00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:15.980
And then finally,
someday, when I've

00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:19.393
got a little bit more bandwidth
in my class to do this,

00:11:19.393 --> 00:11:20.810
I'd really like
to sort of justify

00:11:20.810 --> 00:11:23.268
where you can derive this one
a little bit more rigorously.

00:11:23.268 --> 00:11:25.100
But for now, it's
sufficient just

00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:27.210
to sort of say, look
at that formula,

00:11:27.210 --> 00:11:29.720
and you'll see that it's true.

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:34.490
If you take-- and
then you cyclically

00:11:34.490 --> 00:11:54.180
permute the second,
third, and fourth indices,

00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:59.090
you get zero, OK?

00:11:59.090 --> 00:12:02.680
There is a variant of this
particular symmetry, which

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:09.260
is that if you take this and you
antisymmetrize on these things,

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:10.340
you get zero, OK?

00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:11.960
And I've got some
words in the notes

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:13.900
that, in the
interest of time, I'm

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:15.993
not going to go through
them, but they are posted,

00:12:15.993 --> 00:12:17.660
demonstrating why
those two are actually

00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:18.980
equivalent to one another.

00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:22.688
What it boils down to is, expand
out this antisymmetrization--

00:12:22.688 --> 00:12:24.980
and I'm going to do that
again for a three-index object

00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:26.840
a little bit later
in this lecture--

00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:30.800
and then occasionally invoke
one of these other ones,

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:34.220
and you'll see that these
two, four and four prime, are

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:37.110
saying the same thing.

00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:41.360
So go through all of these
different symmetries,

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:45.860
and you'll find n to the
4 independent components

00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:53.042
goes over to n squared times
n squared minus 1 over 12, OK?

00:12:53.042 --> 00:12:54.250
Not terribly hard to do that.

00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:57.650
It's a little exercise
in combinatorics.

00:12:57.650 --> 00:13:01.490
And when you do that for n
equals 20, as I mentioned,

00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:04.031
you end up with--

00:13:04.031 --> 00:13:05.505
excuse me, not n equals 20.

00:13:05.505 --> 00:13:12.980
When you do this with n
equals 4, you end up with 20.

00:13:16.190 --> 00:13:18.680
And just for completeness,
let me actually write out

00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:27.430
that if you actually-- if you
go into the local Lorentz frame,

00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:36.130
your spacetime metric is
in fact minus 1, 1, 1,

00:13:36.130 --> 00:13:38.060
1 on the diagonal.

00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:41.680
But you, of course, have
these quadratic corrections,

00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:44.503
and one can in fact write
them out explicitly.

00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:52.950
So that is what the time
piece ends up looking like.

00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:59.700
There is an off-diagonal
piece, which

00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:02.370
only enters at quadratic order.

00:14:07.463 --> 00:14:10.780
It looks like this, and move
this down a little bit lower.

00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:30.750
That's what your space-based
piece will look like.

00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:34.010
So this explicitly constructs
the coordinate system

00:14:34.010 --> 00:14:38.990
used in a freely falling frame,
including these second order

00:14:38.990 --> 00:14:39.920
corrections.

00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:45.077
So this particular form is known
as Riemann normal coordinates.

00:14:50.810 --> 00:14:52.993
So if you are--

00:14:52.993 --> 00:14:55.160
this is discussed in a
little bit more detail in one

00:14:55.160 --> 00:15:00.620
of the optional
readings in the textbook

00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:04.520
by Eric Poisson, A
Relativist's Toolkit.

00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:05.875
Very nice discussion.

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:29.750
All right, so now that we have
the curvature tensor in hand,

00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:32.900
we really have
essentially every tool

00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:35.713
that matters for 8.962, OK?

00:15:35.713 --> 00:15:37.130
There's a little
bit more analysis

00:15:37.130 --> 00:15:44.210
we need to do with this guy,
but we now have all the pieces.

00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:47.840
OK, there's no major
new mathematical object

00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:50.210
or no object
described in geometry

00:15:50.210 --> 00:15:51.922
that I need to build
in order for us

00:15:51.922 --> 00:15:53.630
to make a relativistic
theory of gravity.

00:15:55.845 --> 00:15:58.220
I do want to talk about the
curvature tensor a little bit

00:15:58.220 --> 00:16:01.430
more, because there are a
couple of properties about it

00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:03.905
that are very important for us.

00:16:03.905 --> 00:16:05.780
And I think we'll have
just enough time today

00:16:05.780 --> 00:16:06.738
to sort of get to them.

00:16:06.738 --> 00:16:10.220
That will allow us to set
up, and in the first lecture

00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:11.900
that I will record
in an empty room,

00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:15.990
actually derive a
relativistic gravity equation.

00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:18.568
So let me talk
about a few variants

00:16:18.568 --> 00:16:19.610
of this curvature tensor.

00:16:25.570 --> 00:16:35.140
So first, suppose you take the
trace on some pair of indices.

00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:38.280
So what I mean by the
trace is, essentially,

00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:41.040
imagine all the indices are
in the downstairs position,

00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:43.110
and I contract it
with the metric,

00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:44.852
so that I'm summing over them.

00:16:44.852 --> 00:16:46.560
Well, first of all,
you'll note that when

00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:50.130
you do this, if you were to take
the trace on indices 1 and 2,

00:16:50.130 --> 00:16:51.660
they are antisymmetric.

00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:55.710
The metric is symmetric, so
contracting metric with indices

00:16:55.710 --> 00:16:57.720
1 and 2 is going to give me 0.

00:16:57.720 --> 00:17:02.580
If I can track symmetric with
indices 3 and 4, I get 0, OK?

00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:05.099
So the only trace
that makes sense

00:17:05.099 --> 00:17:09.359
is do it on either indices 1
and 3 or on indices 2 and 4.

00:17:09.359 --> 00:17:10.920
Let's do it on indices 1 and 3.

00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:28.740
So what I'm going to do is
evaluate R, alpha mu alpha nu--

00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:35.922
which if you like, you can
write this as R alpha beta of R.

00:17:35.922 --> 00:17:37.610
Here, I'll turn it like this.

00:17:37.610 --> 00:17:40.500
Beta mu alpha nu--

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:48.410
we're going to define this
as R with two indices, OK?

00:17:48.410 --> 00:17:50.042
Just little r and mu, nu.

00:17:50.042 --> 00:17:52.250
This actually shows up enough
that it's given a name.

00:17:52.250 --> 00:17:55.900
This is called the
Ricci curvature tensor.

00:18:13.370 --> 00:18:16.580
If you were to like, I said, if
you do your trace on indices 1

00:18:16.580 --> 00:18:18.630
and 2, you get 0.

00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:24.120
If you do it on 3
and 4, you get 0.

00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:26.810
If you do it on 2 and
4, it's exactly the same

00:18:26.810 --> 00:18:29.810
as doing it on 1 and 3, because
of all these other symmetries.

00:18:29.810 --> 00:18:31.970
So in fact, this ends
up, when you count up

00:18:31.970 --> 00:18:33.680
all your different
symmetries, this

00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:36.108
is the only trace that
is meaningful, OK?

00:18:36.108 --> 00:18:38.150
There are a few other
pairs where you get a minus

00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:40.860
sign, but still the same thing.

00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:44.040
So this is the only trace
that ends up being meaningful.

00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:47.120
This is actually,
in fact, it's not

00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:48.925
too hard to show that
this is symmetric.

00:18:48.925 --> 00:18:50.300
So even though,
you know, Riemann

00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:52.910
had all these crazy
antisymmetries and symmetries,

00:18:52.910 --> 00:18:54.440
this one is simpler, OK?

00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:10.280
One way to do this is just
to take the exact expression

00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:14.390
that we wrote down
for the Riemann tensor

00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:16.730
in terms of derivatives of
Christoffel and Christoffel

00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:20.930
squared, and just write it
out in this traced over form.

00:19:20.930 --> 00:19:29.570
So when you do
this, you get this.

00:19:29.570 --> 00:19:33.050
This guy is symmetric on
the bottom two indices.

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:43.210
Now, this isn't
obviously symmetric,

00:19:43.210 --> 00:19:45.340
but recall, a
lecture or two ago, I

00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:47.650
worked through a couple of
identities that involved

00:19:47.650 --> 00:19:49.465
the determinant of the metric.

00:19:49.465 --> 00:19:52.420
It turns out, if you go back and
you look up these identities,

00:19:52.420 --> 00:19:59.550
you can rewrite this term as
d nu of d mu of the log of j--

00:19:59.550 --> 00:20:02.230
excuse me, log of
square root of j.

00:20:02.230 --> 00:20:04.298
Symmetric when you
exchange mu and nu.

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:21.710
And then you get two
terms that look like this.

00:20:21.710 --> 00:20:23.600
OK, this one, pretty
obviously symmetric

00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:25.268
on exchange of mu and nu.

00:20:25.268 --> 00:20:27.560
When you do this one, you
might think to yourself, hmm,

00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:29.143
that one doesn't
quite look symmetric.

00:20:29.143 --> 00:20:32.760
But remember, alpha and
beta are both dummy indices.

00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:35.120
And so in fact, when
you exchange mu and nu,

00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:37.948
this last term just
turns back into itself.

00:20:37.948 --> 00:20:39.740
So that's kind of
interesting, because R mu

00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:42.020
nu-- the reason I went
through that little exercise--

00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:47.360
this is a symmetric
tensor, and we're

00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:49.620
going to work in four
dimensions of spacetime here.

00:20:49.620 --> 00:20:56.180
So symmetric 4 by 4 has
10 independent components.

00:21:01.710 --> 00:21:02.880
Riemann had 20.

00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:06.510
Somehow, this Ricci has--

00:21:06.510 --> 00:21:09.570
in some sense, you can
of it as having 10 of--

00:21:09.570 --> 00:21:11.880
the 20 components
associated with Riemann

00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:15.230
are encoded in this guy.

00:21:15.230 --> 00:21:16.340
Where are the other 10?

00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:18.548
I'm going to talk about that
in just a moment or two.

00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:37.290
Before I do that,
I will just note

00:21:37.290 --> 00:21:39.060
that we are going
to want to also know

00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:43.440
about the trace of
the Ricci tensor.

00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:56.090
So if you compute this, this
is often just abbreviated R

00:21:56.090 --> 00:21:59.000
with no indices whatsoever.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.660
This is called the Ricci
scalar or the curvature scalar.

00:22:16.510 --> 00:22:19.930
So there's another variant
of curvature which we're not

00:22:19.930 --> 00:22:22.490
going to use very much, but I
wanted to just talk about very,

00:22:22.490 --> 00:22:25.400
very briefly.

00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:29.173
The derivation of this
is highly non-obvious,

00:22:29.173 --> 00:22:30.673
so let me just write
it out, and I'm

00:22:30.673 --> 00:22:32.840
going to talk about it briefly.

00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:37.880
So suppose I define
a four-index tensor,

00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:45.240
C alpha mu lambda sigma,
to be the Riemann tensor--

00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:50.780
minus-- so working
in n dimensions--

00:22:50.780 --> 00:22:56.492
2 over n minus 2, g alpha--

00:22:56.492 --> 00:22:59.620
I'm going to
antisymmetrize here.

00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:01.910
So antisymmetrizing
on lambda and sigma--

00:23:33.340 --> 00:23:42.460
OK, so in the famous words
of Rabi, who ordered that?

00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:47.050
So the way that this has been
constructed, if you go through

00:23:47.050 --> 00:23:48.940
and you carefully look
at the way this thing

00:23:48.940 --> 00:23:52.000
behaves under exchange
of any pairs of indices,

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.790
it has exactly the same
symmetries as Riemann.

00:24:06.510 --> 00:24:11.160
But if you take the trace of
this, turns out to be zero.

00:24:20.512 --> 00:24:22.470
In fact, when you go
through, when you count up

00:24:22.470 --> 00:24:24.330
how many independent
components it has,

00:24:24.330 --> 00:24:29.291
because it has no trace, it
has 10 independent components.

00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:50.500
So this tensor has a name.

00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:55.710
It was first formulated by the
mathematician Hermann Weyl.

00:24:55.710 --> 00:24:57.220
And so although
it's a German name

00:24:57.220 --> 00:24:59.860
and it's not spelled that way,
it is appropriately the "vile"

00:24:59.860 --> 00:25:00.360
tensor.

00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:02.710
It is a pretty vile
thing to look at,

00:25:02.710 --> 00:25:04.190
but it plays an important role.

00:25:14.570 --> 00:25:16.270
So in keeping with
the idea that it's

00:25:16.270 --> 00:25:18.670
got 10 independent
components, Ricci

00:25:18.670 --> 00:25:22.720
has 10 independent
components, Riemann has 20.

00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:28.390
Heuristically, you can sort
of think and put big quotes

00:25:28.390 --> 00:25:29.560
around all these objects.

00:25:32.330 --> 00:25:33.720
This doesn't mean approximately.

00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:34.960
Let's just put it this way.

00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:45.020
This is, got all the same
information as Ricci plus Weyl,

00:25:45.020 --> 00:25:45.610
OK?

00:25:45.610 --> 00:25:48.692
One can, in fact-- by
bringing in appropriate powers

00:25:48.692 --> 00:25:50.150
in the metric and
things like that,

00:25:50.150 --> 00:25:52.370
one can actually write down a
real equation relating these.

00:25:52.370 --> 00:25:53.080
It's a bit of a mess.

00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:54.070
It's not that interesting.

00:25:54.070 --> 00:25:55.695
The key thing I want
you to be aware of

00:25:55.695 --> 00:25:59.470
is that all of the
curvature content of Riemann

00:25:59.470 --> 00:26:02.137
is sort of split
into Ricci and Weyl.

00:26:02.137 --> 00:26:04.720
Looking ahead a little bit-- and
because I'm going to be doing

00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:07.960
this in an empty room, I just
want to make this point now--

00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:14.590
we are soon going to see
that Ricci is very closely

00:26:14.590 --> 00:26:23.015
related to sources of gravity.

00:26:27.470 --> 00:26:30.650
So we're going to-- when we
formulate a theory of gravity,

00:26:30.650 --> 00:26:32.893
working with things,
we're going to find

00:26:32.893 --> 00:26:34.310
that there's a
tensor that is just

00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:37.010
a slight modification of
the Ricci tensor, that

00:26:37.010 --> 00:26:38.510
is equal to the
stress energy tensor

00:26:38.510 --> 00:26:39.920
that we use as our source.

00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:42.830
Stress energy tensor is a
symmetric 4 by 4 object.

00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:46.550
Those 10 degrees of freedom
in the stress energy tensor

00:26:46.550 --> 00:26:48.530
essentially determine
the 10 curvature degrees

00:26:48.530 --> 00:26:50.002
of freedom encoded in Ricci.

00:26:50.002 --> 00:26:51.710
But what that tells
you is that if you're

00:26:51.710 --> 00:26:56.630
in a region of vacuum, where
there is no stress energy,

00:26:56.630 --> 00:26:59.160
there's no Ricci, OK?

00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:00.750
But there is curvature.

00:27:00.750 --> 00:27:01.770
We measure tides.

00:27:01.770 --> 00:27:03.810
We see gravitational effects.

00:27:03.810 --> 00:27:07.260
Weyl ends up being the quantity
that describes behavior

00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:11.130
of gravity in vacuum regions.

00:27:11.130 --> 00:27:13.860
Ricci ends up very closely
related to how it describes it

00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:15.277
in regions with matter.

00:27:15.277 --> 00:27:17.235
One reason I mentioned
this-- so there's only--

00:27:17.235 --> 00:27:19.140
[CHUCKLES] only one
LIGO student here now.

00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:20.193
Hi, Sylvia.

00:27:20.193 --> 00:27:23.010
[CHUCKLES] But in fact,
when one is describing

00:27:23.010 --> 00:27:25.830
gravitational radiation, the
behavior of the Weyl tensor

00:27:25.830 --> 00:27:28.320
ends up being very
important for characterizing

00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:30.390
the degrees of freedom
associated with radiation

00:27:30.390 --> 00:27:31.960
and general relativity.

00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:33.173
So that's a little bit ahead.

00:27:33.173 --> 00:27:34.590
There's a few other
things you can

00:27:34.590 --> 00:27:36.548
do with it which are
related to what are called

00:27:36.548 --> 00:27:38.140
conformal transformations.

00:27:38.140 --> 00:27:40.042
I have a few notes on
them, but they're not

00:27:40.042 --> 00:27:41.250
that important for our class.

00:27:41.250 --> 00:27:42.875
It's discussed a
little bit in Carroll,

00:27:42.875 --> 00:27:46.333
so I'll leave that as a
reading if you are interested,

00:27:46.333 --> 00:27:48.000
but we don't need to
go through it here.

00:27:50.753 --> 00:27:52.170
So there are two
other things that

00:27:52.170 --> 00:27:54.420
are much more important for
us to discuss with respect

00:27:54.420 --> 00:27:57.870
to Riemann first, and
I'm going to focus

00:27:57.870 --> 00:28:01.830
the time that we have on them.

00:28:01.830 --> 00:28:04.880
So one of the really
important aspects

00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:07.100
of curvature that I've
emphasized a few times now

00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:12.320
is the idea that initially
parallel geodesics

00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:14.690
become no longer parallel
when they're moving

00:28:14.690 --> 00:28:16.790
on a manifold that is curved.

00:28:16.790 --> 00:28:18.740
We're going to use
the Riemann curvature

00:28:18.740 --> 00:28:22.640
tensor to quantify what the
breakdown of parallelism

00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:23.450
actually means.

00:28:37.130 --> 00:28:39.800
There's a couple of
different discussions of this

00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:42.450
that you'll see
in various places.

00:28:42.450 --> 00:28:46.460
Carroll's discussion
is very brief.

00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:47.210
It's rigorous.

00:28:47.210 --> 00:28:47.930
It's very brief.

00:28:47.930 --> 00:28:51.823
I'm doing something
that's a little bit--

00:28:51.823 --> 00:28:53.240
to my mind, it's
a little bit more

00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:54.740
physically motivated
OK so I'm going

00:28:54.740 --> 00:28:56.782
to do it in a slightly
different way from the way

00:28:56.782 --> 00:28:57.870
it's done in Carroll.

00:28:57.870 --> 00:29:02.930
It's a little close to the way
it's done in Schutz's textbook.

00:29:02.930 --> 00:29:05.930
So what we want to do is
imagine we have initially

00:29:05.930 --> 00:29:15.830
parallel geodesics,
and what we want to do

00:29:15.830 --> 00:29:22.700
is characterize how
they become nonparallel.

00:29:30.775 --> 00:29:33.960
Well, we'll put it this
way, how they deviate

00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:37.658
as one moves along
their world lines--

00:29:37.658 --> 00:29:38.700
around these world lines.

00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:43.740
OK, so here's what I want to do.

00:29:43.740 --> 00:29:46.270
That's the idea of the
calculation that I want to do.

00:29:46.270 --> 00:29:48.570
So what I want to
start out with is--

00:29:48.570 --> 00:29:53.580
let's consider two
nearby geodesics.

00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:03.140
And what I'm going
to mean by nearby

00:30:03.140 --> 00:30:06.080
is that they are close enough
that they're essentially

00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:08.540
in the same local
Lorentz frame, OK?

00:30:08.540 --> 00:30:10.260
So they're going to
have the same metric.

00:30:10.260 --> 00:30:12.010
I'm going to be able
to choose coordinates

00:30:12.010 --> 00:30:14.480
such that the Christoffel
symbol is zero for both of them.

00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:16.420
I will not be able to get
rid of the second derivative,

00:30:16.420 --> 00:30:17.210
though, OK?

00:30:17.210 --> 00:30:21.010
So that will be where a bit of
a difference begins to enter.

00:30:21.010 --> 00:30:25.310
Two nearby geodesics--
and I'm going

00:30:25.310 --> 00:30:28.010
to use just lambda as the
affine parameter along them.

00:30:37.610 --> 00:30:38.980
So here's my first one.

00:30:43.660 --> 00:30:45.910
I'm going to make a few
definitions on the next board.

00:30:45.910 --> 00:30:53.920
I'm going to call this gamma
sub v. And here's my next one.

00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:56.800
I'm going to call
it gamma sub u.

00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:02.840
Define two points here.

00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:08.200
OK, I'm going to make
a couple of definitions

00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:08.950
on the next board.

00:31:23.310 --> 00:31:25.560
OK, so definitions--

00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:31.690
I'm going to call u the tangent
vector to the curve gamma sub

00:31:31.690 --> 00:31:32.190
u.

00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:38.260
OK?

00:31:38.260 --> 00:31:43.720
So this is equal to dx
d lambda on that curve.

00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:52.505
v is the tangent
vector to gamma sub

00:31:52.505 --> 00:32:05.660
v. The point A is at lambda
0 on curve gamma sub u.

00:32:08.810 --> 00:32:21.160
A prime is at lambda
sub 0 on gamma v.

00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:24.910
So they're both parameterized
by a parameter lambda,

00:32:24.910 --> 00:32:26.310
and I'm going to set the--

00:32:26.310 --> 00:32:29.250
they're basically both
synchronizing their clocks

00:32:29.250 --> 00:32:30.160
at the same time.

00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:32.320
Like, at those
points, they're going

00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:34.990
to find their starting
points as A and A prime.

00:32:34.990 --> 00:32:36.700
What I'm going to
do now is I'm going

00:32:36.700 --> 00:32:39.640
to define what's called
a geodesic displacement

00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:43.780
factor that points from
lambda on the u curve

00:32:43.780 --> 00:32:47.405
to lambda on the v curve.

00:32:47.405 --> 00:32:50.930
And I'm going to use my
favorite Greek letter, xi.

00:32:54.570 --> 00:33:00.730
So this points from
lambda on gamma u

00:33:00.730 --> 00:33:04.050
to lambda that is basically
to the same value.

00:33:07.350 --> 00:33:09.450
Let me make this a
little bit more precise.

00:33:09.450 --> 00:33:19.410
Points from the event
at lambda on gamma u

00:33:19.410 --> 00:33:23.840
to the event at
lambda on gamma v--

00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:24.340
OK?

00:33:24.340 --> 00:33:27.540
Apologies for being
somewhat didactic there,

00:33:27.540 --> 00:33:29.880
but we need to define
things carefully.

00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:34.810
So on this-- so
here's my initial--

00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:43.440
so that's what xi looks
like at parameter lambda 0.

00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:47.340
And what we want
to do is examine

00:33:47.340 --> 00:33:50.340
how xi evolves as one moves
along these geodesics.

00:33:50.340 --> 00:33:53.365
That's going to be our goal.

00:33:53.365 --> 00:33:55.740
So let's make things a little
bit more quantitative here.

00:34:12.340 --> 00:34:20.650
Xi is going to be equal
to x gamma v at lambda

00:34:20.650 --> 00:34:26.290
minus x on gamma u at lambda.

00:34:26.290 --> 00:34:29.817
Finally, I'm going to assume
that the curves begin parallel

00:34:29.817 --> 00:34:30.400
to each other.

00:34:38.790 --> 00:34:54.409
That's a statement that u of
lambda 0 equals v of lambda 0.

00:34:54.409 --> 00:34:57.995
And it also tells
me that I can use--

00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:11.190
that this must equal 0
at the initial point.

00:35:11.190 --> 00:35:12.960
Not going to equal 0 everywhere.

00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:13.710
In fact, it won't.

00:35:17.230 --> 00:35:19.230
But I want to use this
as a boundary condition

00:35:19.230 --> 00:35:20.688
in the calculation
I'm about to do.

00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:32.340
OK.

00:35:40.470 --> 00:35:44.000
So what we're going to do is
essentially say, you know,

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:46.670
as we move along these two
curves, these are geodesics.

00:35:46.670 --> 00:35:48.800
We're going to use the
geodesic equation to slide

00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:50.030
along these two curves.

00:35:50.030 --> 00:35:52.520
We know what the
equation is that governs

00:35:52.520 --> 00:35:54.230
u as it moves along gamma u.

00:35:54.230 --> 00:35:56.030
We know what the
equation is that governs

00:35:56.030 --> 00:35:58.110
v it moves along
gamma v. We're just

00:35:58.110 --> 00:35:59.860
going to take the
difference between them,

00:35:59.860 --> 00:36:03.800
and we're going to kind of use
that to develop an acceleration

00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:08.757
equation that governs
that displacement xi.

00:36:08.757 --> 00:36:11.090
Here's the bit where I differ
a little bit from Carroll.

00:36:11.090 --> 00:36:13.940
So Carroll, like I said, Carroll
has a very brief discussion,

00:36:13.940 --> 00:36:15.300
which is--

00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:16.873
it's absolutely right.

00:36:16.873 --> 00:36:19.040
But I want to give a little
bit of physical insight,

00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:23.435
and I think you can do
that by choosing to work

00:36:23.435 --> 00:36:24.560
in the local Lorentz frame.

00:36:48.510 --> 00:36:51.170
So we're going to work in
the local Lorentz frame,

00:36:51.170 --> 00:36:52.920
and I'm going to center
this local Lorentz

00:36:52.920 --> 00:37:05.170
frame on the event A. The reason
why I'm doing that is this then

00:37:05.170 --> 00:37:12.990
allows me to say, g mu nu
at the event is A mu nu.

00:37:23.140 --> 00:37:24.290
Pardon me a second.

00:37:24.290 --> 00:37:31.130
My Christoffel symbols at event
A are all going to be zero.

00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:43.702
g mu nu at A prime is
also going to be A mu nu.

00:37:43.702 --> 00:37:45.160
We have to be a
little bit careful.

00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:49.950
Our Christoffel symbols do
not vanish at point A prime

00:37:49.950 --> 00:37:51.700
because there's a
little bit of curvature.

00:37:51.700 --> 00:38:06.010
They are in fact related to the
fact that I'm sort of slightly

00:38:06.010 --> 00:38:08.708
far away, and I'm picking up
that second order correction,

00:38:08.708 --> 00:38:11.150
OK?

00:38:11.150 --> 00:38:16.082
This is sort of where all the
important bits of the analysis

00:38:16.082 --> 00:38:17.040
are going to come from.

00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:19.590
This is the fact that
they're close to each other.

00:38:19.590 --> 00:38:21.260
I can set up a
local Lorentz frame,

00:38:21.260 --> 00:38:23.660
but it's got that little
bit of sort of schmutz

00:38:23.660 --> 00:38:25.280
at second order
that's coming in,

00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:27.610
and kind of pushing me away
from a simple local Lorentz

00:38:27.610 --> 00:38:28.800
frame there--

00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:31.380
the simple mathematical
form right there.

00:38:31.380 --> 00:38:34.430
OK, let's put that up.

00:38:37.010 --> 00:38:37.510
OK.

00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:55.320
So let's look at the
equations that govern

00:38:55.320 --> 00:38:56.820
motion along these two curves.

00:39:02.730 --> 00:39:09.160
So the geodesic equation
along curve gamma u--

00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:17.360
and we'll just look at it
at A. It's a second order--

00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:20.630
I'm going to write it in
terms of the coordinates.

00:39:20.630 --> 00:39:22.790
It looks like this.

00:39:22.790 --> 00:39:27.620
We're evaluating this at A. At
A, my Christoffel symbols are

00:39:27.620 --> 00:39:30.740
all zero, so this is just zero.

00:39:38.830 --> 00:39:46.760
Let's look at it along the
other curve, at A prime.

00:40:16.888 --> 00:40:17.388
OK?

00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:32.765
So in just a second,
I am going to--

00:40:37.210 --> 00:40:40.270
wait a second.

00:40:40.270 --> 00:40:45.340
I'm going to substitute in
that derivative of Christoffel

00:40:45.340 --> 00:40:46.630
that's going to go in there.

00:40:46.630 --> 00:40:48.400
Before I do that--
so notice, this also

00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:50.800
depends on the velocity as
I move along at that point,

00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:51.300
right?

00:40:51.300 --> 00:40:52.697
Typical geodesic--

00:40:52.697 --> 00:40:54.280
So I'm going to
substitute in the fact

00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:59.740
that both the x mu and
the x nu velocity here,

00:40:59.740 --> 00:41:04.516
this is defined as v mu.

00:41:04.516 --> 00:41:06.910
But remember, these
guys are defined

00:41:06.910 --> 00:41:08.350
as being initially parallel.

00:41:14.655 --> 00:41:16.120
OK?

00:41:16.120 --> 00:41:18.805
So what this tells me is--

00:41:25.238 --> 00:41:26.420
OK, that's an alpha.

00:41:43.032 --> 00:41:43.990
So this is interesting.

00:41:43.990 --> 00:41:46.780
What I'm seeing is I
end up with an equation

00:41:46.780 --> 00:41:50.200
where the derivative of
the Christoffel symbol

00:41:50.200 --> 00:41:56.170
is coupling to sort of my
motion along that world

00:41:56.170 --> 00:41:58.810
line and the displacement.

00:41:58.810 --> 00:42:01.480
Now, let me just remind you,
what I really wanted to do

00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:05.350
was get an equation that governs
how this guy changes, OK?

00:42:05.350 --> 00:42:08.560
But this guy is just
defined as the difference

00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:13.600
between the position along
curve v minus the position

00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:16.758
along curve u.

00:42:16.758 --> 00:42:18.800
So if I take the difference
of these two things--

00:42:27.980 --> 00:42:32.230
pardon me, forgot to label
which curve this one is on.

00:42:32.230 --> 00:42:40.570
So I'm doing this at A
prime, doing this one at A.

00:42:40.570 --> 00:42:48.560
This is an equation
governing the acceleration

00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:49.960
of this displacement.

00:43:00.460 --> 00:43:01.960
OK?

00:43:01.960 --> 00:43:03.390
So this is interesting, OK?

00:43:03.390 --> 00:43:06.260
So what you're sort of seeing is
that the geodesic displacement

00:43:06.260 --> 00:43:10.310
looks something
like two derivatives

00:43:10.310 --> 00:43:13.820
of the metric coupling
in the forward velocity

00:43:13.820 --> 00:43:16.370
and the displacement itself.

00:43:16.370 --> 00:43:22.630
Now, as written, this equation
is fine if all you are doing

00:43:22.630 --> 00:43:24.830
is living life in the
local Lorentz frame, OK?

00:43:24.830 --> 00:43:26.830
We want to do a little
better than that, though.

00:43:26.830 --> 00:43:30.520
So I'm going to do a little
bit more massaging of this,

00:43:30.520 --> 00:43:33.610
but I kind of want to emphasize
that this already brings out

00:43:33.610 --> 00:43:35.228
the key physical point, OK?

00:43:35.228 --> 00:43:37.520
I can't yet-- you know, you're
sort of looking at this,

00:43:37.520 --> 00:43:39.062
and you're thinking
to yourself, that

00:43:39.062 --> 00:43:41.620
looks like a piece of Riemann,
but it ain't Riemann, right?

00:43:41.620 --> 00:43:43.370
It's a derivative of
a Christoffel symbol,

00:43:43.370 --> 00:43:44.370
and that's not a tensor.

00:43:44.370 --> 00:43:46.453
So this isn't quite the
kind of thing we want yet.

00:43:46.453 --> 00:43:48.050
We need to do a
little bit more work.

00:43:52.430 --> 00:43:55.035
And so what I would
sort of say is,

00:43:55.035 --> 00:43:56.410
everything I did
up to here, this

00:43:56.410 --> 00:43:58.032
is like the key
important physics.

00:43:58.032 --> 00:43:59.740
Now I'm going to do
a little bit of stuff

00:43:59.740 --> 00:44:03.140
to sort of put the suit and
tie that a tensor is supposed

00:44:03.140 --> 00:44:03.640
to wear.

00:44:03.640 --> 00:44:05.348
I'm going to dress it
up a little bit, so

00:44:05.348 --> 00:44:07.462
that it's wearing the
clothes that all quantities

00:44:07.462 --> 00:44:08.920
in this class are
supposed to wear.

00:44:19.070 --> 00:44:21.580
So we want to make
this tensorial.

00:44:30.860 --> 00:44:34.175
And so for guidance of
that, these time derivatives

00:44:34.175 --> 00:44:36.050
or derivatives with
respect to the parameter,

00:44:36.050 --> 00:44:38.510
it's not really
nicely formulated, OK?

00:44:38.510 --> 00:44:41.300
The thing which
we should note is,

00:44:41.300 --> 00:44:45.710
d by d lambda, that's
what I get when

00:44:45.710 --> 00:44:48.890
I contract the forward velocity
with a partial derivative.

00:44:48.890 --> 00:44:52.400
What we should do is
replace this with something

00:44:52.400 --> 00:45:03.580
like what I'm going to call
capital D by d lambda, which

00:45:03.580 --> 00:45:06.920
is what I'm going to get
when I do derivatives using--

00:45:06.920 --> 00:45:08.630
when I use forward
velocity contracted

00:45:08.630 --> 00:45:12.270
on a covariant derivative, OK?

00:45:12.270 --> 00:45:12.770
So--

00:45:21.250 --> 00:45:22.590
Suppose I just--

00:45:22.590 --> 00:45:24.510
I'm agnostic about
what xi actually is.

00:45:24.510 --> 00:45:26.400
I just know it's a
vector field, and I

00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:27.660
want to compute this thing.

00:45:27.660 --> 00:45:30.230
Well, we learned how to do
that a couple lectures ago.

00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:36.320
I'm going to work this guy out.

00:45:44.280 --> 00:45:55.070
And-- [EXCLAIMS] I couple in
a term that looks like this.

00:45:55.070 --> 00:45:56.570
You might be tempted
at this point

00:45:56.570 --> 00:45:58.400
to go, oh, I'm in a
local Lorentz frame.

00:45:58.400 --> 00:46:00.230
I can get rid of
that Christoffel.

00:46:00.230 --> 00:46:02.180
Don't do that quite
yet, because we're

00:46:02.180 --> 00:46:04.190
going to want to take
one more derivative.

00:46:04.190 --> 00:46:06.725
Christoffel does vanish,
but its derivative does not.

00:46:06.725 --> 00:46:08.600
Wait till you've done
all of your derivatives

00:46:08.600 --> 00:46:11.587
before you insert
that relationship.

00:46:30.100 --> 00:46:31.600
Just getting another
piece of chalk.

00:46:40.150 --> 00:46:43.420
So my covariant derivative
along the trajectory

00:46:43.420 --> 00:46:51.375
with my parameter is the
usual total derivative plus--

00:46:57.831 --> 00:46:59.630
that, OK?

00:46:59.630 --> 00:47:02.079
Now, I'm going to want to
take one more derivative.

00:47:29.524 --> 00:47:31.060
OK?

00:47:31.060 --> 00:47:34.990
So there's a lot
of junk in here.

00:47:34.990 --> 00:47:36.100
I'm going to get one term.

00:47:40.830 --> 00:47:43.110
It just looks like this.

00:47:43.110 --> 00:47:45.600
But now I'm going to get a
whole bunch of other terms

00:47:45.600 --> 00:47:46.738
that involve--

00:47:46.738 --> 00:47:48.780
so this is what I get when
I expand this guy out,

00:47:48.780 --> 00:47:49.590
and I just have--

00:47:51.957 --> 00:47:53.290
well, I should hang on a second.

00:47:53.290 --> 00:47:54.748
So first, I'm going
to get one that

00:47:54.748 --> 00:47:59.340
involves essentially the
first term, u on the partial,

00:47:59.340 --> 00:48:01.000
hitting both of these terms.

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:02.700
OK, so when I do that--

00:48:06.210 --> 00:48:07.610
pardon me just one moment.

00:48:13.430 --> 00:48:14.290
OK, never mind.

00:48:19.232 --> 00:48:20.690
Let me just write
it down, and I'll

00:48:20.690 --> 00:48:21.898
describe where it comes from.

00:48:26.450 --> 00:48:32.360
OK, so this first term, this is
basically the connection term

00:48:32.360 --> 00:48:33.950
coupling to this, OK?

00:48:33.950 --> 00:48:36.077
Associated with this
covariant derivative.

00:48:36.077 --> 00:48:37.910
Now I'm going to have
a whole bunch of terms

00:48:37.910 --> 00:48:43.570
that involve this guy operating
on these terms over here.

00:48:43.570 --> 00:48:46.652
And my apologies that the board
is not clearing as well as I

00:48:46.652 --> 00:48:47.360
would like today.

00:48:55.980 --> 00:48:56.740
And you know what?

00:48:56.740 --> 00:48:59.670
I'm going to just
write it out like this,

00:48:59.670 --> 00:49:01.590
and move to a different
board in a second.

00:49:09.430 --> 00:49:09.930
OK?

00:49:16.023 --> 00:49:18.440
All right, so I'm going to put
this over on the other side

00:49:18.440 --> 00:49:20.390
here.

00:49:20.390 --> 00:49:22.610
What I have there-- so the
first term, like I said,

00:49:22.610 --> 00:49:25.395
I'm basically just
operating that thing

00:49:25.395 --> 00:49:26.520
on the two different terms.

00:49:26.520 --> 00:49:29.450
So it's a little easy when
I first hit it on the d xi d

00:49:29.450 --> 00:49:31.617
lambda, and it's going to
be messy when I expand out

00:49:31.617 --> 00:49:33.575
all the derivatives that
operate on here, which

00:49:33.575 --> 00:49:35.480
is why I'm writing
it with some care,

00:49:35.480 --> 00:49:38.390
because we're about to make
a lot of mess on the board.

00:49:49.288 --> 00:49:49.788
OK.

00:50:19.250 --> 00:50:25.842
OK, so first, I'm going to do
what happens when this guy hits

00:50:25.842 --> 00:50:26.800
the Christoffel symbol.

00:50:46.290 --> 00:50:48.030
Then I'm going to
get a term that

00:50:48.030 --> 00:50:56.680
involves this
combination of guys

00:50:56.680 --> 00:50:58.668
acting on the four velocity.

00:51:13.330 --> 00:51:18.440
And then I get these guys
acting on my displacement.

00:51:18.440 --> 00:51:21.220
OK, [BLOWS AIR] now
I'm ready to simplify.

00:51:21.220 --> 00:51:24.520
OK, so let me just emphasize,
everything I have here,

00:51:24.520 --> 00:51:27.850
all I did was expand
out those derivatives

00:51:27.850 --> 00:51:30.430
and write them in a form where
I want to basically call out

00:51:30.430 --> 00:51:33.550
different terms and
see how they behave.

00:51:33.550 --> 00:51:35.590
Two things to bear
in mind, I am going

00:51:35.590 --> 00:51:38.590
to do this in the
local Lorenz frame

00:51:38.590 --> 00:51:52.080
and in the vicinity
of the point A.

00:51:52.080 --> 00:51:55.970
That's going to allow me to
get rid of a lot of terms.

00:51:58.968 --> 00:52:00.760
I'll use the-- here's
an open box of chalk.

00:52:06.550 --> 00:52:10.780
OK, so earlier, I didn't want
to get rid of my Christoffel

00:52:10.780 --> 00:52:13.360
symbols because I was going
to take another derivative.

00:52:13.360 --> 00:52:14.780
I'm done with that.

00:52:14.780 --> 00:52:17.890
So anything that's just
a Christoffel on its own,

00:52:17.890 --> 00:52:19.510
I go into local Lorentz form--

00:52:19.510 --> 00:52:22.060
Christoffel, you die!

00:52:22.060 --> 00:52:24.348
Die!

00:52:24.348 --> 00:52:25.640
Can't really do much with this.

00:52:25.640 --> 00:52:27.150
Let's set this aside.

00:52:27.150 --> 00:52:29.730
Let's look at this guy.

00:52:29.730 --> 00:52:34.400
What do we know about
the forward vector u?

00:52:34.400 --> 00:52:35.550
It's a geodesic.

00:52:35.550 --> 00:52:37.200
It obeys the geodesic equation.

00:52:37.200 --> 00:52:40.950
The geodesic equation is, this
thing in parentheses equals 0.

00:52:40.950 --> 00:52:42.570
You die!

00:52:42.570 --> 00:52:46.260
Finally, I have this condition
here at the beginning.

00:52:46.260 --> 00:52:54.050
That is essentially
the velocity at point A

00:52:54.050 --> 00:52:58.070
minus the velocity at point
B. Our initial condition

00:52:58.070 --> 00:53:02.420
is that these things start
out parallel to each other.

00:53:02.420 --> 00:53:05.495
These die because these
are initially parallel.

00:53:09.040 --> 00:53:13.900
So initially parallel geodesic--

00:53:13.900 --> 00:53:15.910
local Lorentz frame--

00:53:15.910 --> 00:53:18.160
So the only derivative I'm
going to need to expand out

00:53:18.160 --> 00:53:21.820
is this guy, and because I'm
working in a local Lorentz

00:53:21.820 --> 00:53:24.490
frame, that's
actually not that bad.

00:53:37.960 --> 00:53:42.030
So what I finally get
after all the smoke clears

00:53:42.030 --> 00:53:45.590
is that my covariant
acceleration

00:53:45.590 --> 00:53:48.450
of this displacement
vector is related

00:53:48.450 --> 00:53:55.040
to my noncovariant
acceleration, with a term

00:53:55.040 --> 00:53:57.980
that basically ends
up just being--

00:53:57.980 --> 00:54:05.540
oops-- a derivative of
the Christoffel symbol.

00:54:05.540 --> 00:54:08.940
It couples in two
powers of the four

00:54:08.940 --> 00:54:15.210
velocity and the displacement.

00:54:15.210 --> 00:54:16.980
But we actually already have--

00:54:16.980 --> 00:54:22.830
we worked out earlier
what this guy was, OK?

00:54:22.830 --> 00:54:27.960
So my noncovariant acceleration
was a different derivative

00:54:27.960 --> 00:54:29.920
of the Christoffel symbol.

00:54:29.920 --> 00:54:31.740
So if I go and I plug this in--

00:54:55.560 --> 00:54:56.880
My apologies for pausing here.

00:54:56.880 --> 00:54:58.960
There are a lot of
indices on this page.

00:55:03.880 --> 00:55:06.670
Look at this, I've got a
derivative of Christoffel

00:55:06.670 --> 00:55:09.550
minus a derivative
of a Christoffel.

00:55:09.550 --> 00:55:11.800
That is exactly what
the Riemann curvature

00:55:11.800 --> 00:55:14.957
tensor looks like in
the local Lorentz frame.

00:55:14.957 --> 00:55:17.540
Now, if you actually go back and
you look up your definitions,

00:55:17.540 --> 00:55:19.390
you'll see it's not quite right.

00:55:19.390 --> 00:55:23.350
There's a couple of indices that
are sort of a little bit off,

00:55:23.350 --> 00:55:25.840
but they turn out to
all be dummy indices.

00:55:25.840 --> 00:55:27.730
So what you should
do at this point

00:55:27.730 --> 00:55:31.900
is just relabel a couple
of your dummy indices.

00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:57.300
So if on the second term, you
take beta to mu, mu to gamma,

00:55:57.300 --> 00:56:23.190
and nu to beta, what you
finally wind up with is--

00:56:32.470 --> 00:56:34.470
We'll write it first in
the local Lorentz frame.

00:56:50.740 --> 00:56:54.080
This is nothing but the Riemann
tensor in the local Lorentz

00:56:54.080 --> 00:56:54.580
frame.

00:56:54.580 --> 00:56:57.130
And from the principle
that a tensor equation that

00:56:57.130 --> 00:57:00.670
holds in one frame
must hold in all,

00:57:00.670 --> 00:57:15.560
we can deduce from
this that this

00:57:15.560 --> 00:57:18.320
is the way the
displacement behaves.

00:57:18.320 --> 00:57:21.190
So I start out
with two geodesics

00:57:21.190 --> 00:57:23.830
that are perfectly
parallel to one another.

00:57:23.830 --> 00:57:25.940
If they are in a
spacetime that is curved,

00:57:25.940 --> 00:57:28.970
the Riemann curvature tensor
tells how those initially

00:57:28.970 --> 00:57:34.370
parallel trajectories evolve as
I move along those geodesics.

00:57:34.370 --> 00:57:36.450
So I want to make two remarks.

00:57:36.450 --> 00:57:41.240
One is just sort of a way of
thinking about the calculation

00:57:41.240 --> 00:57:42.080
I just did.

00:57:42.080 --> 00:57:43.580
It may not-- you
might be slightly

00:57:43.580 --> 00:57:44.700
dissatisfied with
the fact that I

00:57:44.700 --> 00:57:46.220
decided to do the
whole calculation

00:57:46.220 --> 00:57:48.110
in a whole special frame.

00:57:48.110 --> 00:57:52.940
If that's-- you would prefer to
see something a little bit more

00:57:52.940 --> 00:57:56.480
rigorous, feel free to explore
some of the other textbooks

00:57:56.480 --> 00:57:58.460
that we have for this class.

00:57:58.460 --> 00:58:01.215
They do treat this a little
bit more rigorously than this.

00:58:01.215 --> 00:58:02.840
One reason why I
wanted to do this is I

00:58:02.840 --> 00:58:04.880
wanted to really
emphasize this idea

00:58:04.880 --> 00:58:06.680
that where this
effect comes from is

00:58:06.680 --> 00:58:10.040
that if I think about the freely
falling frame describing two

00:58:10.040 --> 00:58:12.645
nearby geodesics, it
is that derivative,

00:58:12.645 --> 00:58:15.020
it's that secondary derivative
of the metric, that really

00:58:15.020 --> 00:58:18.320
plays a fundamental role in
driving these two things apart.

00:58:18.320 --> 00:58:22.010
What we get out of it is a
completely frame-independent

00:58:22.010 --> 00:58:24.890
equation, and this
ends up really

00:58:24.890 --> 00:58:27.620
being the key equation
describing the behavior

00:58:27.620 --> 00:58:30.590
of tides in general relativity.

00:58:30.590 --> 00:58:33.943
We're going to-- when you go
into a freely falling frame,

00:58:33.943 --> 00:58:35.360
we've basically
at that point said

00:58:35.360 --> 00:58:38.960
there's no longer such a thing
as gravitational acceleration.

00:58:38.960 --> 00:58:40.960
And if there's no
gravitational acceleration

00:58:40.960 --> 00:58:43.310
that's coming, well, what
the hell does gravity do?

00:58:43.310 --> 00:58:46.580
General relativity, tides
become the key thing

00:58:46.580 --> 00:58:50.330
that really defines what
the action of gravity is.

00:58:50.330 --> 00:58:52.880
One of the ones I am personally
very interested in applying

00:58:52.880 --> 00:58:54.710
this to is that this
equation gives you

00:58:54.710 --> 00:58:56.870
a very rigorous and
frame-independent way

00:58:56.870 --> 00:59:00.530
to describe how a gravitational
wave detector responds

00:59:00.530 --> 00:59:02.747
to the impact of a
gravitational wave.

00:59:02.747 --> 00:59:04.580
If you imagine you have
two test masses that

00:59:04.580 --> 00:59:09.590
are moving through spacetime,
they just follow geodesics, OK?

00:59:09.590 --> 00:59:10.730
They feel gravity.

00:59:10.730 --> 00:59:12.170
They are free falling.

00:59:12.170 --> 00:59:13.415
They don't do anything.

00:59:13.415 --> 00:59:15.457
If you look at them, if
you're falling with them,

00:59:15.457 --> 00:59:18.770
you don't see any
effect whatsoever.

00:59:18.770 --> 00:59:21.590
But if they're sufficiently
far away from one another

00:59:21.590 --> 00:59:24.860
that their displacement
kind of takes the curvature

00:59:24.860 --> 00:59:28.550
to that freely falling
frame, then this equation

00:59:28.550 --> 00:59:30.890
governs how the separation
between the two of them

00:59:30.890 --> 00:59:32.687
actually evolves with time.

00:59:32.687 --> 00:59:34.520
And so for instance,
if you're a student who

00:59:34.520 --> 00:59:36.853
works in LIGO, where some of
the many important analyses

00:59:36.853 --> 00:59:40.220
describing how gravitational
wave detectors respond

00:59:40.220 --> 00:59:41.820
to an [INAUDIBLE]
radiation field,

00:59:41.820 --> 00:59:44.120
they are based on this equation.

00:59:44.120 --> 00:59:45.950
If you're interested
in understanding

00:59:45.950 --> 00:59:49.340
how an extended
object is tidally

00:59:49.340 --> 00:59:52.040
distorted due to the fact
that it's sort of big enough

00:59:52.040 --> 00:59:54.410
that it doesn't all sort
of live at a single point,

00:59:54.410 --> 00:59:57.830
but its shape spills across
the local Lorentz frame,

00:59:57.830 --> 00:59:59.390
this equation
governs-- it allows

00:59:59.390 --> 01:00:01.015
you to set up some
of the stresses that

01:00:01.015 --> 01:00:04.700
act upon that body and change
it from a simple point mass.

01:00:04.700 --> 01:00:07.250
So I'm waxing slightly
rhapsodic here,

01:00:07.250 --> 01:00:10.250
because this is one of the more
important physical equations

01:00:10.250 --> 01:00:13.390
that come out of the
class at this point.

01:00:13.390 --> 01:00:21.940
All right, in our
last 12 or 13 minutes,

01:00:21.940 --> 01:00:26.020
I would like to do one
other little identity which

01:00:26.020 --> 01:00:40.510
is extremely important,
but rather messy.

01:00:40.510 --> 01:00:43.427
In fact, I think I'm going to
just-- if I have the time--

01:00:43.427 --> 01:00:44.260
yeah, you know what?

01:00:44.260 --> 01:00:45.302
I think I will have time.

01:00:45.302 --> 01:00:51.050
I'm going to set up the first
page of the next lecture.

01:00:51.050 --> 01:00:54.310
So let's move away
from-- oh, by the way,

01:00:54.310 --> 01:00:56.990
I forgot to give
the name of this.

01:00:56.990 --> 01:01:01.200
This is the equation
of geodesic deviation.

01:01:20.270 --> 01:01:25.810
OK, so recall when we first
talked about the Riemann

01:01:25.810 --> 01:01:26.310
tensor.

01:01:35.940 --> 01:01:37.612
There's a very
mathematical action

01:01:37.612 --> 01:01:38.820
that the Riemann tensor does.

01:01:38.820 --> 01:01:40.278
You can think of
it as what happens

01:01:40.278 --> 01:01:43.260
when you have a commutator of
covariant derivatives acting

01:01:43.260 --> 01:01:43.830
on a vector.

01:01:58.630 --> 01:02:02.790
So if I evaluate the
commentator, sigma lambda--

01:02:02.790 --> 01:02:09.270
excuse me-- covariant of
lambda covariant with sigma

01:02:09.270 --> 01:02:18.460
acting on v alpha, OK, it
ends up looking like this.

01:02:18.460 --> 01:02:21.900
And I argue that this definition
is kind of the differential

01:02:21.900 --> 01:02:24.870
version of that little holonomy
operation by which I derived

01:02:24.870 --> 01:02:26.550
Riemann in the first place.

01:02:26.550 --> 01:02:29.370
A more generalized
form of this is,

01:02:29.370 --> 01:02:38.420
suppose I act on some
object with two indices, one

01:02:38.420 --> 01:02:40.100
in the upstairs, one
in the downstairs.

01:02:50.446 --> 01:02:50.946
Oops.

01:03:02.310 --> 01:03:03.750
OK?

01:03:03.750 --> 01:03:06.720
So these are just some reminders
of a couple definitions.

01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:11.700
I want to use this.

01:03:11.700 --> 01:03:15.465
I'm going to apply these
things to two relationships

01:03:15.465 --> 01:03:17.990
that I'm going to
write down, and I'm

01:03:17.990 --> 01:03:20.840
going to do something
kind of crazy,

01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:24.230
then I'm going to do something
a little bit crazier,

01:03:24.230 --> 01:03:27.950
and something kind of cool
is going to emerge from this.

01:03:27.950 --> 01:03:30.650
And this is something that
deserves a clean board.

01:03:50.050 --> 01:03:55.570
So I'm going to write down
relationship A. That's

01:03:55.570 --> 01:03:58.160
what I get when I
do the commutator

01:03:58.160 --> 01:04:06.000
of the alpha beta derivatives
on the gamma derivative

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.850
of some one form, OK?

01:04:08.850 --> 01:04:12.480
Now, if I apply those little
definitions I worked out,

01:04:12.480 --> 01:04:17.940
this is Riemann mu
gamma alpha beta--

01:04:32.975 --> 01:04:33.970
OK?

01:04:33.970 --> 01:04:36.760
So this is relationship A.

01:04:36.760 --> 01:04:42.750
Relationship B,
I'm going to take

01:04:42.750 --> 01:04:54.540
the covariant derivative
along alpha, of the beta gamma

01:04:54.540 --> 01:04:59.550
commutator on p delta, OK?

01:04:59.550 --> 01:05:00.800
So notice the difference here.

01:05:00.800 --> 01:05:02.630
One, I'm doing the
commutator acting

01:05:02.630 --> 01:05:04.613
on this particular derivative.

01:05:04.613 --> 01:05:06.030
Next one, I'm doing
the derivative

01:05:06.030 --> 01:05:07.310
of commutator acting on this.

01:05:10.720 --> 01:05:14.480
And so I'm going to skip a line
or two that are in my notes,

01:05:14.480 --> 01:05:19.460
but this ends up turning
into minus p mu--

01:05:25.870 --> 01:05:36.145
beta alpha delta minus
R mu and delta gamma.

01:05:39.260 --> 01:05:40.150
OK?

01:05:40.150 --> 01:05:42.880
So the way I went to get
this line, so the two lines

01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:47.190
that I skipped over, one is I
just straightforwardly applied

01:05:47.190 --> 01:05:49.690
the commutator derivative,
and then took a derivative.

01:05:49.690 --> 01:05:51.640
And then I took
advantage of the fact

01:05:51.640 --> 01:06:00.370
that I can commute the metric
with covariant derivatives,

01:06:00.370 --> 01:06:03.110
and sort of raising
the next, move things--

01:06:03.110 --> 01:06:05.573
move an index up on one
side and down on the other,

01:06:05.573 --> 01:06:07.740
and take advantage of some
symmetries of the Riemann

01:06:07.740 --> 01:06:11.420
tensor to slough
my indices around.

01:06:11.420 --> 01:06:13.575
OK, so this board's
kind of a disaster,

01:06:13.575 --> 01:06:15.120
so I'm going to go
to a cleaner board

01:06:15.120 --> 01:06:17.360
here for what I want to do next.

01:06:17.360 --> 01:06:19.110
I'm just going to clean
this so you're not

01:06:19.110 --> 01:06:20.193
distracted by its content.

01:06:23.720 --> 01:06:28.060
So two equations,
what the hell do they

01:06:28.060 --> 01:06:30.440
have to do with each other?

01:06:30.440 --> 01:06:43.130
Here is where I'm going to do
something which you might--

01:06:43.130 --> 01:06:44.790
let's do the other board.

01:06:44.790 --> 01:06:47.940
I'm going through something
that you might legitimately

01:06:47.940 --> 01:06:49.320
think is crazy.

01:06:49.320 --> 01:06:52.680
What I want to do
is take equation A--

01:06:56.450 --> 01:06:58.800
actually, I'm going to look
at both of these equations.

01:06:58.800 --> 01:07:05.350
And I am going to antisymmetrize
on the indices alpha, beta,

01:07:05.350 --> 01:07:05.850
and gamma.

01:07:24.622 --> 01:07:25.970
OK?

01:07:25.970 --> 01:07:27.220
So just bear with me a second.

01:07:30.050 --> 01:07:32.447
So the way I'm
going to do this--

01:07:32.447 --> 01:07:33.530
here's what I'm doing now.

01:07:36.140 --> 01:07:37.593
Here's my commutator.

01:07:49.930 --> 01:07:51.730
So if I look at equation A--

01:07:56.340 --> 01:07:56.840
OK?

01:07:56.840 --> 01:07:58.520
So I need to expand
this guy out.

01:08:02.260 --> 01:08:05.681
Let me just write out a
step of this analysis.

01:08:10.980 --> 01:08:20.581
The way you do this is you
add up every even permutation

01:08:20.581 --> 01:08:21.289
of those indices.

01:08:39.370 --> 01:08:40.360
That's a beta.

01:08:46.340 --> 01:08:51.016
And then you subtract
off every odd permutation

01:08:51.016 --> 01:08:51.724
of these indices.

01:09:21.300 --> 01:09:23.790
Oh, and don't forget--

01:09:23.790 --> 01:09:26.180
exactly on that one form, OK?

01:09:29.680 --> 01:09:32.210
So now we can--

01:09:32.210 --> 01:09:39.170
if you expand these guys
out, and gather terms exactly

01:09:39.170 --> 01:09:45.130
correctly, it's not hard
to show that this turns out

01:09:45.130 --> 01:09:58.620
to be what you get if you just
slide those commutators over

01:09:58.620 --> 01:09:59.190
by one.

01:10:41.435 --> 01:10:43.423
OK.

01:10:43.423 --> 01:10:47.290
You know, if you're really
feeling motivated, just try it,

01:10:47.290 --> 01:10:50.020
OK?

01:10:50.020 --> 01:10:55.360
What this is is, the
right hand side--

01:10:55.360 --> 01:10:58.870
sorry, this is the
left hand side--

01:10:58.870 --> 01:11:02.140
we'll put this way.

01:11:02.140 --> 01:11:09.870
So when I apply this to the
left hand side of equation A,

01:11:09.870 --> 01:11:13.440
what emerges is the
antisymmetrized left hand

01:11:13.440 --> 01:11:38.160
side of equation B.

01:11:38.160 --> 01:11:43.590
So when I antisymmetrize on
the indices alpha, beta, gamma,

01:11:43.590 --> 01:11:45.210
these two relationships become--

01:11:45.210 --> 01:11:46.440
they say the same thing.

01:12:03.430 --> 01:12:08.170
So that means the right hand
side must be the same as well.

01:12:08.170 --> 01:12:10.270
So let's apply this
and see what happens

01:12:10.270 --> 01:12:14.440
if I require the antisymmetrized
right hand side of A

01:12:14.440 --> 01:12:30.600
to equal the antisymmetrized
right hand side of B.

01:12:30.600 --> 01:12:34.650
OK, so first, if I remind myself
how I order these equations--

01:12:34.650 --> 01:12:35.150
OK, yeah.

01:12:35.150 --> 01:13:32.580
So let's do-- here's
A, and here is B.

01:13:32.580 --> 01:13:36.830
OK, so a few things to notice.

01:13:36.830 --> 01:13:38.900
This term, we
actually showed when

01:13:38.900 --> 01:13:42.410
we looked at the different
symmetries of the Riemann

01:13:42.410 --> 01:13:43.900
tensor.

01:13:43.900 --> 01:13:46.400
This is-- I didn't actually
show this, but it's in the notes

01:13:46.400 --> 01:13:47.670
and I stated it.

01:13:47.670 --> 01:13:49.610
This is one of those symmetries.

01:13:49.610 --> 01:13:51.560
If I take this thing,
and I just add up

01:13:51.560 --> 01:13:56.150
what I get when I permute
the three final indices,

01:13:56.150 --> 01:13:57.622
I get zero.

01:13:57.622 --> 01:13:59.330
And that's equivalent
to antisymmetrizing

01:13:59.330 --> 01:14:00.690
on these things.

01:14:00.690 --> 01:14:02.810
So this is zero by
Riemann symmetry.

01:14:11.190 --> 01:14:16.890
This term here and this term
here are exactly the same, OK?

01:14:16.890 --> 01:14:19.055
Because the only
indices that are

01:14:19.055 --> 01:14:21.430
in a slightly different order
are alpha, beta, and gamma.

01:14:21.430 --> 01:14:22.870
This one goes
alpha, beta, gamma.

01:14:22.870 --> 01:14:25.245
Where I wrote it here, it just
became beta, gamma, alpha.

01:14:25.245 --> 01:14:27.420
That's a cyclic permutation
I've antisymmetrized.

01:14:27.420 --> 01:14:29.323
They are exactly the same.

01:14:29.323 --> 01:14:31.490
So these are on the same
side-- or on opposite sides

01:14:31.490 --> 01:14:32.610
of the equation.

01:14:32.610 --> 01:14:35.350
So they cancel each other out.

01:14:35.350 --> 01:14:40.370
And so what arises
from all this is p mu--

01:14:44.700 --> 01:14:46.678
pardon me, I missed
the derivative.

01:15:04.990 --> 01:15:09.880
I've set no properties
on p, so the only way

01:15:09.880 --> 01:15:22.090
this can always hold is if in
fact, this is equal to zero.

01:15:24.640 --> 01:15:29.562
This is a result known
as the Bianchi identity.

01:15:37.756 --> 01:15:40.250
Let me just write
another form of it,

01:15:40.250 --> 01:15:42.920
and then I'm fairly
pressed for time,

01:15:42.920 --> 01:15:44.630
so I think I'm just
going to write down

01:15:44.630 --> 01:15:47.060
the result of the
next thing, and I

01:15:47.060 --> 01:15:51.010
will put the
details of this into

01:15:51.010 --> 01:15:52.490
the first prerecorded lecture.

01:16:01.310 --> 01:16:04.400
If you expand out
that antisymmetry

01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:11.330
and take advantage of
the Riemann symmetry--

01:16:11.330 --> 01:16:23.630
the various Riemann
symmetry relationships,

01:16:23.630 --> 01:16:24.820
this is an equivalent form.

01:16:30.170 --> 01:16:33.760
So these two things both
are an important geometric

01:16:33.760 --> 01:16:37.870
relationship the curvature
tensor must go by.

01:16:37.870 --> 01:16:44.270
Now, in some notes that
I am going to-- well,

01:16:44.270 --> 01:16:49.030
they're actually already
scanned and on the web.

01:16:49.030 --> 01:16:53.980
What I do is take the
Bianchi identity and contract

01:16:53.980 --> 01:17:02.610
on some of the indices to
convert my Riemann tensor--

01:17:02.610 --> 01:17:05.040
my Riemann curvature,
into a Ricci tensor--

01:17:05.040 --> 01:17:06.215
Ricci curvature.

01:17:17.860 --> 01:17:20.965
So in particular, if I use
this second form of it,

01:17:20.965 --> 01:17:22.590
it's just covariant
derivatives, right?

01:17:22.590 --> 01:17:24.780
And the metric commutes
with covariant derivatives,

01:17:24.780 --> 01:17:27.750
so I can just sort
of walk it through.

01:17:27.750 --> 01:17:32.940
What you find when you do
this is that you can write

01:17:32.940 --> 01:17:40.020
this relationship in
the following form,

01:17:40.020 --> 01:17:42.920
and the derivation of this
will be scanned and posted,

01:17:42.920 --> 01:17:46.040
and I will step through it in
the first recorded lecture.

01:17:48.660 --> 01:17:51.390
The divergence of a
particular combination

01:17:51.390 --> 01:17:56.040
of the Ricci curvature and the
Ricci scalar is equal to zero.

01:17:56.040 --> 01:18:00.060
This is a sufficiently
interesting tensor

01:18:00.060 --> 01:18:01.920
that it is now given a name.

01:18:05.350 --> 01:18:12.550
We write this G, and we call
this the Einstein curvature

01:18:12.550 --> 01:18:13.050
tensor.

01:18:26.180 --> 01:18:28.520
I sort of mentioned that one
of our governing principles

01:18:28.520 --> 01:18:31.670
here is, we're going to change
the source of gravitation

01:18:31.670 --> 01:18:34.850
from just matter density to
the stress energy tensor.

01:18:34.850 --> 01:18:38.720
That is a two-index
divergence-free tensor.

01:18:38.720 --> 01:18:40.393
We want our gravitational--

01:18:40.393 --> 01:18:41.810
the left hand side
of the equation

01:18:41.810 --> 01:18:43.280
to look like two derivatives
in the metric, which

01:18:43.280 --> 01:18:43.905
is a curvature.

01:18:43.905 --> 01:18:47.760
So we need a divergence-free
two-index curvature.

01:18:47.760 --> 01:18:49.227
Ta-da!

01:18:49.227 --> 01:18:50.810
It's got Einstein's
name on it, so you

01:18:50.810 --> 01:18:52.520
know it's got to be good.

01:18:52.520 --> 01:18:57.030
All right, so that is where,
unfortunately, the COVID virus

01:18:57.030 --> 01:18:59.390
is requiring us to
stop for the semester,

01:18:59.390 --> 01:19:01.680
at least as far
as in-person goes.

01:19:01.680 --> 01:19:07.100
So look for notes to be
posted, videos to be posted,

01:19:07.100 --> 01:19:11.300
and I, of course,
will be in contact,

01:19:11.300 --> 01:19:12.860
behind a sick wall or something.

01:19:12.860 --> 01:19:14.960
But anyway,
[CHUCKLES] certainly,

01:19:14.960 --> 01:19:16.730
I am not going out of contact.

01:19:16.730 --> 01:19:24.170
And so those of you who are
scattering to parts unknown--

01:19:24.170 --> 01:19:26.570
known to you, that
is, unknown to me--

01:19:26.570 --> 01:19:29.630
good luck with your travels
and getting yourselves settled.

01:19:29.630 --> 01:19:31.793
I really feel--
everyone feels terrible

01:19:31.793 --> 01:19:33.710
that you're going through
this crap right now,

01:19:33.710 --> 01:19:38.330
but hopefully, this will
flatten the curve, as they say,

01:19:38.330 --> 01:19:40.610
and it will be the
right thing to do.

01:19:40.610 --> 01:19:42.020
But stay in touch, OK?

01:19:42.020 --> 01:19:45.590
This campus is going to be weird
and sad without the students

01:19:45.590 --> 01:19:49.090
here, and so we want
to hear from you.

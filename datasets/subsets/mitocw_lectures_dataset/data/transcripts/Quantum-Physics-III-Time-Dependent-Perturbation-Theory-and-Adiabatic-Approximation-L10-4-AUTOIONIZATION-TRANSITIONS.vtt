WEBVTT

00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.920
PROFESSOR: OK, Let's
use the last 10 minutes

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:09.010
to discuss an application.

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:11.400
So that's our Fermi
golden rule there.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.820
Let's leave it in
the blackboard.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.880
So the example I will
discuss qualitatively

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.040
will not compute the
rate for this example is

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:45.310
auto ionization, or also
called Auger transitions.

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.160
So we imagine of--

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.920
I think the reason this
example is interesting

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.650
is that there is continuum
states, sometimes in cases

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.309
that you would not
think about it,

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:06.400
or you wouldn't have
thought about them.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:12.440
So let's assume we
have a helium atom.

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.360
So you have two electrons,
z equals 2, two protons

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.280
and two electrons.

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:24.210
And I will assume that we
have a hydrogenic state.

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.270
So you see the Hamiltonian
of this whole ,

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:35.800
atom there's a P1 squared over
2n plus a P2 squared over 2n,

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:42.820
roughly for each electron,
plus or minus e squared over r1

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:49.210
minus e squared over r2, and
then plus e squared over r1

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.740
minus r2, which is
the Coulomb repulsion.

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.840
So that's roughly
the Hamiltonian

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.890
you need to consider,
at least to 0-th order.

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:09.150
And let's assume this is
H0, and let's consider

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:13.600
states of this Hamiltonian, H0.

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.700
So these are hydrogenic states.

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.840
We treat each electron
independently.

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.930
And therefore, the
energy levels, E

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:28.120
are defined by two principle
quantum numbers, n1 and n2,

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:34.976
and they are minus 13.6
eV times z squared.

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:46.790
The energy of an electron
in a nucleus with z protons

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.600
gets multiplied by z
squared there times 1

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:57.540
over n squared, and 1 squared
plus 1 over n2 squared.

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.540
Those are the principle
quantum numbers.

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:05.030
And z squared is equal to
4, because z is equal to 2.

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:11.330
So this number
comes out at 54.4.

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:22.670
So here is e of n1 n2 is minus
54.4 eV, 1 over n1 squared

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:24.500
plus 1 over n2 squared.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:34.370
OK, let's look at the
spectrum of this atom.

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.770
I'll erase here.

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:45.250
So let's draw a line
here, put 0 here.

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.990
Ground state.

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:50.875
n1 is equal to n2 is equal to 1.

00:03:50.875 --> 00:03:56.520
The ground state
is at minus 108.

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:01.770
That's a state that we call
state 1, 1 for the two quantum

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:05.780
numbers being 1 and 1.

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:13.440
OK, so then we go on,
and look what happens.

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.370
Then we have, for
example, the state 2, 1.

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:28.320
And the state 2, 1 is
going to be less bound,

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.760
because instead of having 1
and 1, you have 1/4 plus 1,

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.010
so it's less bound.

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:36.360
3, 1, 4, 1.

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.380
How about infinity 1?

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:43.800
Infinity 1.

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:49.110
That's n1, the first electron
being super Rydberg atom.

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:51.120
It has its quantum
principle quantum

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:57.360
number so high that it's 0,
and you have the other electron

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:58.890
here with a 1.

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:07.480
So this is at 54.4.

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:11.500
The infinity 1 is here.

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:14.320
One electron is bound
in the one state.

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:18.370
The other electron
is out very far.

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:19.990
It's almost free.

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:22.330
You could have it free.

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:25.570
If it goes free, we'll
have some more energy.

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:29.710
So actually, after
you go here, there's

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:41.640
a continuum of states, a
continuum of states over here

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:47.250
in which every electron here
is an infinity and an electron

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:49.320
with some momentum, k.

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:55.760
And these are still
states that are

00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:03.060
here can be represented
by energies in this range.

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:07.300
And then, eventually, you
have even this goes on here.

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:15.540
So there's a lot of
bound states there,

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:17.800
and then we can continue.

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:20.160
How about the state--

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:25.200
so I've put here infinity.

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:28.650
I'm sorry, not infinity, k.

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:36.670
I will put it here
like k times y,

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:39.880
because the other state
remains in the 1 s.

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:46.930
So one electron-- here both
electrons were in the 1s state.

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:51.290
And here 2s, 3s, infinity.

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:54.040
So one electron
remains in the 1s.

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:57.190
One electron is free with
some momentum over there.

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:05.495
Then, for example,
consider the state E 2, 2.

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:13.750
This happens to be a 2 and a 2
is a quarter, a quarter, 1/2.

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:18.610
So this is at minus 27 eV.

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:21.040
It's right here in the middle.

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:22.555
This is the state 2, 2.

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:33.540
After the state 2, 2 sets in,
there is a state 3, 2, 4, 2, 5,

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:35.480
2, infinity 2.

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:41.410
So one term is infinity.

00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:42.470
The other is 2.

00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:43.910
So it's one quarter.

00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:50.120
And infinity 2 is that
the hydrogen level, 13.6.

00:07:50.120 --> 00:08:00.830
And after that infinity 2,
there is a new continuum

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:07.130
of states that has some
momentum and are still in 2.

00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:11.570
And there's going to be an
infinite number of continuums

00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:16.290
arising here when you consider
one electron and the other one.

00:08:16.290 --> 00:08:19.850
So what is our other transition?

00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:27.200
This was at minus 27.2.

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:30.120
The other transition we're
typically interested in

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:39.299
is this one in which you have
this discrete state overlapped

00:08:39.299 --> 00:08:49.200
by the continuum of states in
which one electron is gone out,

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:53.880
and one electron has
remained in the--

00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:56.310
has gone to the 1s state.

00:08:56.310 --> 00:09:00.100
So I'll write it down here.

00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:04.320
So what is the other transition?

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:07.190
We have precisely this
situation with indicate

00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:09.750
that here in which
you have one state

00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:11.670
surrounded by a continuum.

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:25.500
So the other transition, so
the line 2, 2, at minus 27 eV

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:37.090
is in the middle of the
infinity 1 continuum.

00:09:37.090 --> 00:09:41.140
So we'll have a transition
into 2s squared--

00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:43.690
that's this state,
that's the name of it--

00:09:43.690 --> 00:09:48.840
goes to 1s times 3.

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:56.560
The e 2, 2 is going to
be E1 infinity plus E3.

00:09:56.560 --> 00:10:01.180
And the e 2, 2 is minus 27.2.

00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:07.820
This is minus 54.4,
and this is E3.

00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:16.750
So E3 goes to 27.2 eV
for the free electron.

00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:19.900
So how do we visualize this?

00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:23.720
If you wanted to compute it,
and it's kind of a fun thing,

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:30.550
but we will not do it, you
think of the initial 2s state.

00:10:30.550 --> 00:10:31.670
Have the atom.

00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:36.070
The one is the two
electrons here.

00:10:36.070 --> 00:10:39.190
And you think of them as having
an initial wave function,

00:10:39.190 --> 00:10:44.331
hydrogenic, and then suddenly,
because maybe something

00:10:44.331 --> 00:10:44.830
happened.

00:10:44.830 --> 00:10:48.460
This 1s electron got
excited, and suddenly,

00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:52.960
for an instant of time, the
two are there in the 2s.

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:57.160
And then this
interaction turns on,

00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:04.000
and this is the v that makes
that transition from this 2s

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.900
squared state to 1s 3.

00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:13.620
That has good matrix elements,
and this is going to happen.

00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:16.120
And this is the
dominant transition,

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:20.680
because a radiative transition
in which one goes down here

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:22.040
is fairly suppressed.

00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:23.150
It doesn't happen.

00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:26.710
So this is our example
of an application

00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:31.560
of Fermi's golden rule, and
we'll explore more next time.

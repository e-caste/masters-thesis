00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.530 align:middle line:84%
ROBERT TOWNSEND:
Welcome, everyone.

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:14.850 align:middle line:90%
Try to start on time.

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:18.022 align:middle line:84%
Are there any questions
from last time?

00:00:18.022 --> 00:00:22.200 align:middle line:84%
OK, we'll take a look
at the class syllabus.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.710 align:middle line:84%
We did a theory lecture
on Walrasian equilibria

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:32.009 align:middle line:84%
and 2x2x2 trade models
in theory, last class.

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.780 align:middle line:84%
Today, we're going
to begin the first

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.420 align:middle line:90%
of two applications of that.

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.290 align:middle line:84%
You can see, in fact, on
the reading list the papers

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.580 align:middle line:84%
for today, which includes this
thing with my Thai colleague,

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.640 align:middle line:84%
Archawa, which is taking
the theory model back

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.830 align:middle line:90%
to the Thai applications.

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:52.560 align:middle line:84%
And there's an additional
stared reading here,

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.860 align:middle line:84%
Dawkins, which is
calibration, which

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.730 align:middle line:84%
we have done before with the
medieval villages and dynamics.

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.310 align:middle line:84%
And today, we're
going to do it again.

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:05.319 align:middle line:84%
But that start reading
does not appear anywhere,

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:07.200 align:middle line:90%
particularly in the lectures.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.230 align:middle line:84%
But still, there aren't
a lot of new theorems

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:13.150 align:middle line:84%
and stuff in the lecture
today, mostly concepts.

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:17.310 align:middle line:84%
So I think you can get some time
to look at the Dawkins starred

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.330 align:middle line:90%
article.

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.610 align:middle line:90%
And on the class schedule--

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.830 align:middle line:84%
so after the trade lecture
application today and the one

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.020 align:middle line:90%
next Thursday.

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.140 align:middle line:84%
And then the following
week, on Tuesday,

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.120 align:middle line:84%
I'll conduct with you a review
session of the material covered

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.680 align:middle line:90%
in the last 1/3 of the class.

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.390 align:middle line:84%
So that's the way
the schedule looks.

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.580 align:middle line:84%
Again, let me ask if
there are questions.

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:48.420 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, I'm going to
turn to the study guide

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:54.180 align:middle line:84%
and, in particular, the material
from last time lecture 13.

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.410 align:middle line:84%
So the first review
question was, in addition

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:02.100 align:middle line:84%
to reviewing what it takes
in general equilibrium terms

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.020 align:middle line:84%
to describe an economy,
what additional features do

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:11.750 align:middle line:84%
we need to put in there to
describe a private ownership

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.810 align:middle line:90%
economy?

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.250 align:middle line:90%
And let me see if--

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.245 align:middle line:84%
Dixon, do you want to
take a stab at that?

00:02:19.245 --> 00:02:22.140 align:middle line:90%


00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.420 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so for general
equilibrium [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.800 align:middle line:84%
we need like the consumers'
like preferences and consumption

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:36.680 align:middle line:84%
set, the firm technology, which
is the production set, and then

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.580 align:middle line:84%
economy resources,
which is endowment.

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:45.150 align:middle line:84%
But additionally, for
the private ownership,

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.920 align:middle line:84%
each consumer has
their own endowment.

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:55.140 align:middle line:84%
And also, each consumer has a
complete ownership of the firm.

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.577 align:middle line:84%
So the firm is made out
of consumer ownership.

00:02:59.577 --> 00:03:00.660 align:middle line:90%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Good, OK.

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.500 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, each consumer
has shares in firms.

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.520 align:middle line:84%
So those were the
theta ij parameters.

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:12.780 align:middle line:84%
So if there are profits, as in
decreasing returns to scale,

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:17.500 align:middle line:84%
those profits get distributed
back to households.

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.488 align:middle line:84%
So they own the
returns on the firm.

00:03:19.488 --> 00:03:20.530 align:middle line:90%
So that's a great answer.

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:21.280 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.730 align:middle line:90%


00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:29.430 align:middle line:84%
What is the potential difference
between a Walrasian equilibrium

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:35.000 align:middle line:84%
and a price equilibrium
with transfers?

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.340 align:middle line:84%
Maria Sofia, do you
want to try that one?

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.250 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so with
the price equilibrium

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.110 align:middle line:84%
with transfers,
we're looking to see

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:48.270 align:middle line:84%
if there exists some
assignment of wealth levels

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:51.790 align:middle line:84%
such that the economy will
satisfy a set of constraints.

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.260 align:middle line:84%
But in general, a
Walrasian equilibrium

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:00.000 align:middle line:84%
is a type of price
equilibrium with transfers,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.460 align:middle line:84%
except we have the condition
that the wealth is equal to--

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:07.470 align:middle line:84%
I think it's the
price times the wealth

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.520 align:middle line:84%
plus the sum of the
profits over the shares

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:15.010 align:middle line:84%
that the consumer has
in various companies.

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:16.510 align:middle line:84%
ROBERT TOWNSEND:
Yes, that's right.

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:20.089 align:middle line:84%
So the Walrasian
equilibrium works off

00:04:20.089 --> 00:04:22.230 align:middle line:84%
of this private
ownership economy.

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:25.280 align:middle line:84%
So we have the valuation of
the household's endowment

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.900 align:middle line:84%
plus the valuation
of the profits

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:33.070 align:middle line:84%
that the household
has a claim to.

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:37.780 align:middle line:90%
And that is a wealth object.

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:41.280 align:middle line:84%
So technically, it looks
like a price equilibrium

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.550 align:middle line:84%
with transfers,
meaning that if we

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:46.350 align:middle line:84%
assign that particular
wealth, we're

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:48.480 align:middle line:90%
going to have an equilibrium.

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:52.800 align:middle line:84%
The more general idea
behind the price equilibrium

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.570 align:middle line:84%
with transfers, though,
including the transfers part,

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:01.560 align:middle line:84%
is that the wealth assignments
that we give to households

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:05.850 align:middle line:84%
may be greater or less than the
valuation of the wealth they

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:12.340 align:middle line:84%
would have if we had restricted
ourselves to private ownership.

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:16.350 align:middle line:84%
So what I didn't, I guess,
emphasize very much is

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:19.410 align:middle line:84%
there are going to be
two welfare theorems

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:21.750 align:middle line:90%
that we will study in detail.

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:27.880 align:middle line:84%
One is that the Walrasian
equilibrium is pareto optimal.

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:31.970 align:middle line:84%
And for that part, we need
private ownership only.

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:35.990 align:middle line:84%
And the second is going to
be that any pareto optimal

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:41.270 align:middle line:84%
allocation can be achieved with
the suitable redistribution

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:42.248 align:middle line:90%
of wealth.

00:05:42.248 --> 00:05:43.790 align:middle line:84%
And that's the part
where we're going

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:47.600 align:middle line:84%
to need this more general
concept of price equilibrium

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:48.650 align:middle line:90%
with transfers.

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:51.580 align:middle line:90%


00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:58.830 align:middle line:84%
The ordering of the class was
to introduce this Walrasian

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:04.600 align:middle line:84%
equilibrium notion, not dwell
on the optimality of it,

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:09.030 align:middle line:84%
but rather get into some
applications and then.

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:11.910 align:middle line:84%
In a couple of weeks, we'll be
back to those welfare theorems

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:15.350 align:middle line:84%
and when they are true
and when they can fail.

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:18.910 align:middle line:84%
So that's the
ordering of the class.

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:25.280 align:middle line:90%
And we got into the 2x2x2.

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:26.750 align:middle line:84%
All of this stuff
at the beginning

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:32.010 align:middle line:84%
is kind of a review
of the notation, where

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:38.910 align:middle line:84%
we have minimizing the cost
of achieving a unit output,

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:41.610 align:middle line:84%
given the vector
of factor prices w.

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:45.770 align:middle line:84%
And we had the
cost-minimizing input values.

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:48.430 align:middle line:90%


00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:51.900 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of all that, I
finally got around to asking,

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:54.540 align:middle line:84%
define what it means for
the production of good 1

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:59.430 align:middle line:84%
to be relatively more
intensive in factor 1

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:05.180 align:middle line:90%
than the production of good 2.

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:11.560 align:middle line:84%
So [INAUDIBLE] see
if we can get some--

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:15.170 align:middle line:84%
how about a volunteer
for that one?

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:17.932 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: I can take this one.

00:07:17.932 --> 00:07:26.510 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so this means that for
producing a unit of good 1

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:33.350 align:middle line:84%
versus a unit of good 2, you
need the ratio of factor 1

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:36.260 align:middle line:84%
to factor 2 that's used to
produce one unit of good 1

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:40.100 align:middle line:84%
is greater than the
ratio of factor 1

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:43.160 align:middle line:84%
to factor 2 in producing
a unit of good 2.

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:44.910 align:middle line:90%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Excellent.

00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:46.510 align:middle line:90%
Perfect answer.

00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:49.560 align:middle line:84%
And then implicit, let
me just add a little bit

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:55.400 align:middle line:84%
editorial, which is, it's
defined over the whole domain.

00:07:55.400 --> 00:08:00.420 align:middle line:84%
So whatever those factor
prices are, w1 in w2,

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:05.170 align:middle line:84%
it remains true that good one
uses relatively more factor

00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:08.240 align:middle line:90%
1 than factor 2 and vice versa.

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:10.210 align:middle line:84%
So it's a statement
about the whole--

00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:13.990 align:middle line:84%
and we used that in
the analysis in class,

00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:15.910 align:middle line:84%
when we were looking
at the cost curves

00:08:15.910 --> 00:08:19.810 align:middle line:84%
and what would happen
if input prices moved.

00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:24.430 align:middle line:90%


00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:29.440 align:middle line:84%
Can someone take a stab at
the Stolper-Samuelson theorem

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:34.375 align:middle line:84%
for the determination of input
prices as output prices change?

00:08:34.375 --> 00:08:37.539 align:middle line:90%


00:08:37.539 --> 00:08:38.679 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: I can.

00:08:38.679 --> 00:08:40.110 align:middle line:90%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: OK.

00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:46.290 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: In this
theorem, we assume

00:08:46.290 --> 00:08:51.030 align:middle line:84%
that the model [INAUDIBLE] to
modify [INAUDIBLE] then when

00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:55.590 align:middle line:84%
the output price, like
the price of good 1,

00:08:55.590 --> 00:09:03.660 align:middle line:84%
increases, then the intensive
factors in producing the good 1

00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:05.820 align:middle line:90%
also increases.

00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:10.260 align:middle line:84%
And another factor,
factor 2, that

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:13.320 align:middle line:84%
was not the intensive
factor [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:16.060 align:middle line:84%
the price of this
factor world goes down.

00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:16.560 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:17.935 align:middle line:84%
ROBERT TOWNSEND:
OK, that's good.

00:09:17.935 --> 00:09:19.380 align:middle line:90%
Yup.

00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:21.330 align:middle line:84%
So nominally, it's
not a statement

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:23.220 align:middle line:84%
about international
trade, although it

00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:26.510 align:middle line:90%
is very useful in that context.

00:09:26.510 --> 00:09:31.650 align:middle line:84%
We're just basically doing some
comparative static exercises

00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:36.480 align:middle line:84%
of what would happen if these
exogenously given output

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:37.650 align:middle line:90%
prices are changing.

00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:39.375 align:middle line:84%
What's going to happen
to input prices?

00:09:39.375 --> 00:09:43.500 align:middle line:90%


00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:46.050 align:middle line:90%
And then we did a graph.

00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:49.520 align:middle line:84%
We used those cost
curves to illustrate it.

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:51.440 align:middle line:84%
I flagged the last
question, but I really

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:53.240 align:middle line:90%
don't want to ask that one.

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:57.930 align:middle line:84%
I want to ask something a
little harder to answer.

00:09:57.930 --> 00:10:01.260 align:middle line:90%


00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:05.740 align:middle line:84%
If we had two countries,
and each country had

00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:09.120 align:middle line:84%
a representative
consumer, and there

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:15.010 align:middle line:84%
are two goods, each of which can
be produced in both countries,

00:10:15.010 --> 00:10:16.810 align:middle line:84%
and there were two
factors that can

00:10:16.810 --> 00:10:21.060 align:middle line:84%
be used in each good
in each country,

00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:25.210 align:middle line:84%
we've got a lot of
equations and unknowns.

00:10:25.210 --> 00:10:28.000 align:middle line:84%
We've got the
consumers' consumption

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.680 align:middle line:84%
levels of the two
goods, the input being

00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:35.980 align:middle line:84%
used to produce outputs
of the two goods,

00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:39.160 align:middle line:84%
the outputs themselves
of the two goods,

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:44.750 align:middle line:84%
and the prices of each of the
two inputs in both countries,

00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:48.050 align:middle line:90%
et cetera, et cetera.

00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:52.190 align:middle line:84%
Can someone tell me how we
attack this problem in class,

00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:55.530 align:middle line:90%
in the sense of an algorithm?

00:10:55.530 --> 00:10:57.150 align:middle line:90%
We broke it into pieces.

00:10:57.150 --> 00:11:00.200 align:middle line:90%


00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:03.785 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, it's a very
high-dimensional problem.

00:11:03.785 --> 00:11:08.790 align:middle line:90%


00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:10.050 align:middle line:90%
If you remember the ordering--

00:11:10.050 --> 00:11:10.380 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:12.240 align:middle line:84%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yeah,
go ahead, please.

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:13.740 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I
think that the way

00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:16.980 align:middle line:84%
that we did this was
kind of inductively,

00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:19.740 align:middle line:84%
where I think that the
way that we did this was,

00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:22.950 align:middle line:84%
first, pretend,
basically, that it's just

00:11:22.950 --> 00:11:24.720 align:middle line:90%
like the original 2x2 model.

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:27.970 align:middle line:84%
And then we solve for the
what's supposed to happen there.

00:11:27.970 --> 00:11:30.300 align:middle line:84%
And then we built in the
additional thing of--

00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:33.990 align:middle line:84%
I'm pretty sure we built in the
different endowments, I think,

00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:37.920 align:middle line:84%
was the difference in
the 2x2x2 versus the 2x2.

00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:39.480 align:middle line:84%
But we solve for
the smaller model,

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:42.550 align:middle line:84%
and then we build it
upwards to the bigger one.

00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:44.090 align:middle line:90%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: That's true.

00:11:44.090 --> 00:11:45.790 align:middle line:84%
And what, in
particular, did we focus

00:11:45.790 --> 00:11:47.335 align:middle line:90%
on first in the smaller model?

00:11:47.335 --> 00:11:50.250 align:middle line:90%


00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:53.550 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: I think the way that
we did this was kind of the--

00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:59.240 align:middle line:90%


00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:01.060 align:middle line:90%
I don't think I remember this.

00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:04.370 align:middle line:84%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: OK, anyone else
want to take an attempt at it?

00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:09.980 align:middle line:84%
This is a difficult question
to pose and hard to answer,

00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:13.540 align:middle line:84%
because it has to
do with putting

00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:17.290 align:middle line:84%
the pieces a lot of
information in the lecture

00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:21.460 align:middle line:84%
and taking a step backwards
and thinking about it globally.

00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:28.450 align:middle line:90%


00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:32.890 align:middle line:84%
OK, well, it starts with this
Stolper-Samuelson theorem.

00:12:32.890 --> 00:12:35.950 align:middle line:84%
So at this point, early
on in the lecture,

00:12:35.950 --> 00:12:40.420 align:middle line:84%
we were taking the prices of
the goods p1 and p2, as given.

00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:42.130 align:middle line:84%
We weren't trying
to solve for that.

00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:45.970 align:middle line:84%
I had not yet introduced
consumers either.

00:12:45.970 --> 00:12:49.960 align:middle line:84%
We didn't even attempt to
solve for the quantities.

00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:55.060 align:middle line:84%
We merely wanted to find
equilibrium factor prices.

00:12:55.060 --> 00:13:00.100 align:middle line:90%
So for a given country--

00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:02.730 align:middle line:84%
you could think of it that
way, a given economy--

00:13:02.730 --> 00:13:08.920 align:middle line:84%
we had the minimized cost of
producing one unit of good 1,

00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:14.170 align:middle line:84%
the minimized cost of
producing one unit of good 2.

00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:23.620 align:middle line:84%
And that's in the space
of input prices w1 and w2.

00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:28.840 align:middle line:84%
So we're looking
for an equilibrium.

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:30.480 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, the
input prices should

00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:35.100 align:middle line:84%
be the same regardless of
whether it's good 1 or good 2.

00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:37.290 align:middle line:84%
So we looked at where
those curves crossed,

00:13:37.290 --> 00:13:43.020 align:middle line:84%
and that's the only point in the
diagram where we can both have

00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:50.160 align:middle line:84%
common input prices of the two
inputs and be on those curves,

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:52.050 align:middle line:90%
where the curves crossed.

00:13:52.050 --> 00:13:55.650 align:middle line:84%
So that was the very,
very first part.

00:13:55.650 --> 00:14:04.200 align:middle line:84%
And then given those prices,
we moved to a different space,

00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:06.300 align:middle line:90%
which had isoquants.

00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:13.000 align:middle line:84%
So there, we have the
unit output or any output,

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:18.900 align:middle line:84%
really, described by an
isoquant, a different isoquant

00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:25.810 align:middle line:84%
for different quantities, and
we had the inputs on the x-axis.

00:14:25.810 --> 00:14:31.300 align:middle line:84%
So there, we solved for
minimizing unit cost again,

00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:35.930 align:middle line:84%
but what's on the x and y-axis
would be the input quantities.

00:14:35.930 --> 00:14:42.870 align:middle line:84%
And we know that has to
align with the factor

00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:46.290 align:middle line:90%
prices we already solved for.

00:14:46.290 --> 00:14:51.960 align:middle line:84%
So there, we determine both
the input quantities as well as

00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:58.150 align:middle line:84%
the output quantities,
where both firm 1 and firm 2

00:14:58.150 --> 00:15:01.030 align:middle line:90%
could be in equilibrium.

00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:04.430 align:middle line:84%
And then, finally, at the
very end of the lecture,

00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:12.460 align:middle line:84%
we zeroed out to consider two
countries, not just one, each

00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:14.590 align:middle line:90%
with a consumer.

00:15:14.590 --> 00:15:19.240 align:middle line:84%
And those countries could be in
autarky or potentially trading

00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:20.005 align:middle line:90%
with one another.

00:15:20.005 --> 00:15:23.160 align:middle line:90%


00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:27.990 align:middle line:84%
Both specifications would be
legitimate general equilibrium

00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:30.060 align:middle line:90%
environments, both autarky--

00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:32.640 align:middle line:84%
each country separately
is one-- and then

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:35.730 align:middle line:84%
we traded another,
except, obviously,

00:15:35.730 --> 00:15:38.190 align:middle line:84%
with trade, consumption
and production

00:15:38.190 --> 00:15:41.610 align:middle line:84%
do not have to be the same,
because the countries can

00:15:41.610 --> 00:15:44.430 align:middle line:84%
export one thing
and import another.

00:15:44.430 --> 00:15:47.070 align:middle line:84%
Sorry, that's a rather
long-winded summary.

00:15:47.070 --> 00:15:51.120 align:middle line:84%
But again, it's not the
easiest lecture, maybe

00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:55.060 align:middle line:84%
potentially the hardest
lecture in the whole series

00:15:55.060 --> 00:15:55.970 align:middle line:90%
of lectures.

00:15:55.970 --> 00:15:58.750 align:middle line:84%
So I thought I
would take the time

00:15:58.750 --> 00:16:03.530 align:middle line:84%
to elaborate a bit on
what we were doing.

00:16:03.530 --> 00:16:08.880 align:middle line:90%
OK, so that's the review.

00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:15.520 align:middle line:84%
And we come to applying a very
similar theory to actual data.

00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:18.270 align:middle line:84%
So this is real
and financial flows

00:16:18.270 --> 00:16:21.240 align:middle line:90%
in Thailand and an outline.

00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:23.700 align:middle line:84%
We're going to talk
about villages again,

00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:27.480 align:middle line:84%
but we're going to embed
them in the local economy

00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:31.080 align:middle line:84%
and also their relationship
to the national economy, where

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:33.540 align:middle line:84%
we view the financial
accounts, which

00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:38.580 align:middle line:84%
you've seen once before when
we did the Bitcoin part.

00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:40.140 align:middle line:90%
We'll review them here--

00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:43.200 align:middle line:84%
balance sheets, income
statement, and cash flow--

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:47.160 align:middle line:84%
then more general background
on these village economies

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:49.440 align:middle line:90%
and heterogeneity within them.

00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:54.090 align:middle line:84%
Then we'll take the village
economy, as an entire economy,

00:16:54.090 --> 00:16:59.370 align:middle line:84%
and come up with GDP
and village income,

00:16:59.370 --> 00:17:01.890 align:middle line:84%
the way we come up with
national income and the National

00:17:01.890 --> 00:17:03.930 align:middle line:90%
Income and Product Accounts.

00:17:03.930 --> 00:17:07.300 align:middle line:84%
And then, finally, as
a small open economy,

00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:10.650 align:middle line:84%
we can look at flow of funds,
balance of payments, how open

00:17:10.650 --> 00:17:12.900 align:middle line:90%
or how closed is the economy.

00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:15.099 align:middle line:84%
And then we come to
this calibration part,

00:17:15.099 --> 00:17:17.430 align:middle line:84%
which I already
highlighted, with respect

00:17:17.430 --> 00:17:20.430 align:middle line:84%
to the other starred
reading, Dawkins et al.

00:17:20.430 --> 00:17:22.349 align:middle line:84%
What does it mean
to be calibrating

00:17:22.349 --> 00:17:25.470 align:middle line:84%
a model, which they often
did in the trade context,

00:17:25.470 --> 00:17:27.329 align:middle line:90%
as we do here?

00:17:27.329 --> 00:17:30.600 align:middle line:84%
And we'll look at
model-predicted data

00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:33.660 align:middle line:84%
and compare it
directly to actual data

00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:35.970 align:middle line:84%
and then look at
some counterfactuals,

00:17:35.970 --> 00:17:39.760 align:middle line:84%
like imposing tariffs
and frictions.

00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:43.050 align:middle line:84%
So last time end today, you
could think of this question

00:17:43.050 --> 00:17:47.340 align:middle line:84%
as, free trade, who are the
winners and losers, tariffs,

00:17:47.340 --> 00:17:50.730 align:middle line:84%
who are the winners and losers,
and not in the abstract,

00:17:50.730 --> 00:17:53.100 align:middle line:84%
as in last time,
but actually here,

00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:55.740 align:middle line:84%
in the context of
a calibrated model.

00:17:55.740 --> 00:18:00.510 align:middle line:84%
You'll actually see the impact
on individual people living

00:18:00.510 --> 00:18:01.980 align:middle line:90%
in these villages.

00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:04.110 align:middle line:84%
And then when we
get to the US, we'll

00:18:04.110 --> 00:18:07.740 align:middle line:84%
do it all again on Thursday,
which is a different context,

00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:09.360 align:middle line:90%
but the same kind of theory.

00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:11.820 align:middle line:90%
OK, so you've seen this before.

00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:14.400 align:middle line:90%
Let me highlight the time map.

00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:18.270 align:middle line:84%
We have these two provinces,
Chachoengsao and Lopburi

00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:20.850 align:middle line:84%
in the central area
of the country,

00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:23.850 align:middle line:84%
near, if not right
on top of, Bangkok.

00:18:23.850 --> 00:18:27.420 align:middle line:84%
And we have the other
two, Buriram and Sisaket

00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:31.920 align:middle line:84%
in the Northeast, a much more
agrarian area of the country.

00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:33.450 align:middle line:90%
This is Sisaket.

00:18:33.450 --> 00:18:37.410 align:middle line:84%
I muttered something about not
finding these monthly starred

00:18:37.410 --> 00:18:39.570 align:middle line:84%
villages, but I knew
where they were.

00:18:39.570 --> 00:18:42.270 align:middle line:84%
And now I realize it's
still very hard to read.

00:18:42.270 --> 00:18:47.010 align:middle line:84%
But these Cheerio circles
correspond to baseline survey

00:18:47.010 --> 00:18:48.270 align:middle line:90%
done in 1997.

00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:50.820 align:middle line:84%
A subset of those
villages were chosen

00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:54.420 align:middle line:84%
from '98 onward, including
the data that we're using.

00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:56.310 align:middle line:84%
In which case, it's
a monthly survey.

00:18:56.310 --> 00:18:58.830 align:middle line:84%
So the Cheerio
covers up the star

00:18:58.830 --> 00:19:01.780 align:middle line:84%
and produces these
green-like objects up here.

00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:02.920 align:middle line:90%
So that's the cluster.

00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:05.330 align:middle line:84%
So there are four
villages in Sisaket

00:19:05.330 --> 00:19:07.650 align:middle line:84%
that constitute
the monthly data.

00:19:07.650 --> 00:19:10.830 align:middle line:84%
And likewise, there are going to
be four each in the other three

00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:12.060 align:middle line:90%
provinces.

00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:18.870 align:middle line:84%
OK so let's take Lopburi over
here, and take a wage earner,

00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:24.070 align:middle line:84%
and look at this actual
household's income statement.

00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:27.040 align:middle line:84%
So you've seen version
of this before,

00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:30.270 align:middle line:84%
and I remember asking you
about it in the follow-up.

00:19:30.270 --> 00:19:33.450 align:middle line:90%
We've got revenues and costs.

00:19:33.450 --> 00:19:37.770 align:middle line:84%
In this case, this guy does
a little bit of livestock,

00:19:37.770 --> 00:19:40.470 align:middle line:90%
but mostly, it's wage labor.

00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:44.610 align:middle line:84%
And in principle, could have
had interest income, but didn't.

00:19:44.610 --> 00:19:47.460 align:middle line:84%
And on the cost side,
most of these costs

00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:51.180 align:middle line:84%
are associated with
livestock and in debt

00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:54.400 align:middle line:84%
and actually has an
interest expense,

00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:58.140 align:middle line:84%
and then does consumption and
subtracts that off of income

00:19:58.140 --> 00:19:59.260 align:middle line:90%
and has some savings.

00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:03.270 align:middle line:84%
So that's the income statement
of household A, which

00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:05.130 align:middle line:84%
we have these
kinds of statements

00:20:05.130 --> 00:20:07.890 align:middle line:90%
for roughly 800 households.

00:20:07.890 --> 00:20:09.690 align:middle line:90%
Here's what happens over time.

00:20:09.690 --> 00:20:12.810 align:middle line:84%
That labor income, which is
the dominant source of income,

00:20:12.810 --> 00:20:17.670 align:middle line:84%
falls and then gradually
increases back up again.

00:20:17.670 --> 00:20:20.010 align:middle line:84%
Other components
are largely zero,

00:20:20.010 --> 00:20:22.830 align:middle line:84%
although they
started the business

00:20:22.830 --> 00:20:24.600 align:middle line:90%
in the last year or two.

00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:27.630 align:middle line:84%
Cultivation rises
and then falls again.

00:20:27.630 --> 00:20:30.450 align:middle line:84%
So trying this, that, or
the other, but largely

00:20:30.450 --> 00:20:32.220 align:middle line:90%
labor income.

00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:35.110 align:middle line:84%
This same household
has a balance sheet,

00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:38.250 align:middle line:84%
which has liabilities
on the right-hand side

00:20:38.250 --> 00:20:40.470 align:middle line:84%
and assets on the
left-hand side.

00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:42.480 align:middle line:84%
Since those things
don't balance,

00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:45.210 align:middle line:84%
hopefully liabilities
are smaller than assets,

00:20:45.210 --> 00:20:47.260 align:middle line:90%
and the difference is net worth.

00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:51.000 align:middle line:84%
So we have liabilities and net
worth on the right-hand side

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.650 align:middle line:90%
and assets on the left.

00:20:52.650 --> 00:20:56.490 align:middle line:84%
Assets consist of
financial assets like cash

00:20:56.490 --> 00:21:00.600 align:middle line:84%
and could have been a little
bit of deposits in banks.

00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:03.420 align:middle line:84%
And those are financial
assets, and then

00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:07.810 align:middle line:84%
we have real assets like
livestock and so on,

00:21:07.810 --> 00:21:10.590 align:middle line:84%
inventories, and we
have other fixed assets,

00:21:10.590 --> 00:21:12.785 align:middle line:90%
including household assets, OK?

00:21:12.785 --> 00:21:15.440 align:middle line:84%
And you're wondering
where I'm going with this.

00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:17.630 align:middle line:84%
I'm deliberately
highlighting things

00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:20.300 align:middle line:84%
that are going to
come up momentarily.

00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:24.860 align:middle line:84%
And again, the balance sheet
over time for this household,

00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:29.270 align:middle line:84%
you can see wealth
is going up, mostly

00:21:29.270 --> 00:21:31.550 align:middle line:90%
because assets are going up.

00:21:31.550 --> 00:21:33.650 align:middle line:84%
But toward the end, when
the household started

00:21:33.650 --> 00:21:35.960 align:middle line:90%
that business, they borrowed.

00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:39.940 align:middle line:84%
Liabilities went up, and net
worth actually went down.

00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:42.820 align:middle line:90%
But anyway, this is over time.

00:21:42.820 --> 00:21:44.740 align:middle line:84%
Finally, we have the
statement of cash flow,

00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:47.940 align:middle line:84%
which I highlighted when
we talked about Bitcoin.

00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:50.730 align:middle line:84%
We've got cash flow from
production and cash flow

00:21:50.730 --> 00:21:54.330 align:middle line:84%
from financing investment
and consumption,

00:21:54.330 --> 00:21:57.270 align:middle line:84%
and that produces a
measure of cash flow

00:21:57.270 --> 00:21:59.730 align:middle line:84%
from the flows,
which has to sync up

00:21:59.730 --> 00:22:01.950 align:middle line:84%
with the change in the
cash and the balance

00:22:01.950 --> 00:22:05.650 align:middle line:84%
sheet, which it
does in these data.

00:22:05.650 --> 00:22:08.220 align:middle line:84%
So next, I want to
talk about diversity

00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:10.710 align:middle line:84%
across the
households, especially

00:22:10.710 --> 00:22:14.610 align:middle line:84%
for the ones who are
actually firms, who have

00:22:14.610 --> 00:22:16.690 align:middle line:90%
decided to go into business.

00:22:16.690 --> 00:22:20.880 align:middle line:84%
The types of activities,
cultivation, farming business

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:25.020 align:middle line:84%
like retail outlets, trucking
stuff around livestock, fish

00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:26.310 align:middle line:90%
and shrimp.

00:22:26.310 --> 00:22:30.060 align:middle line:84%
And this is like a Cobb-Douglas
production function written out

00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:30.900 align:middle line:90%
in logs.

00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:34.950 align:middle line:84%
So delta k is the intensity
of the capital good,

00:22:34.950 --> 00:22:39.270 align:middle line:84%
and delta l is the
intensity of the labor good.

00:22:39.270 --> 00:22:42.700 align:middle line:84%
And what we want to see are
those factor intensities.

00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:47.430 align:middle line:84%
So in fact, if you look,
cultivation is labor-intensive.

00:22:47.430 --> 00:22:49.650 align:middle line:84%
It will fit the
definition we reviewed

00:22:49.650 --> 00:22:51.540 align:middle line:90%
at the beginning of class.

00:22:51.540 --> 00:22:54.330 align:middle line:84%
Uses relatively more
labor than capital

00:22:54.330 --> 00:22:58.800 align:middle line:84%
because of the coefficients
delta l and delta k.

00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:00.780 align:middle line:84%
On the other extreme,
the fish and shrimp

00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:05.290 align:middle line:84%
uses almost no labor at all
and uses tons of capital.

00:23:05.290 --> 00:23:09.390 align:middle line:84%
So we've got capital and
labor-intensive activities.

00:23:09.390 --> 00:23:14.130 align:middle line:84%
We can try to make it simpler
and talk about basically

00:23:14.130 --> 00:23:18.220 align:middle line:84%
agricultural goods versus
others called manufacturing.

00:23:18.220 --> 00:23:21.315 align:middle line:84%
It really means
non-agricultural.

00:23:21.315 --> 00:23:25.470 align:middle line:84%
OK, the other thing sitting
up here is this epsilon.

00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:28.020 align:middle line:84%
This is quote, "an error
term," but it actually

00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:33.430 align:middle line:84%
contains not just noisy data,
but a measurement of talent.

00:23:33.430 --> 00:23:37.515 align:middle line:84%
So if we took the average
for a particular household i,

00:23:37.515 --> 00:23:40.030 align:middle line:84%
we took the average
of these epsilons,

00:23:40.030 --> 00:23:43.270 align:middle line:84%
they don't have to
average out to 0.

00:23:43.270 --> 00:23:47.260 align:middle line:84%
They average out to something
that is common to the sector

00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:50.260 align:middle line:84%
that household i has
engaged in, a bar,

00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:52.750 align:middle line:84%
and some other
household-specific talent

00:23:52.750 --> 00:23:54.100 align:middle line:90%
called z, OK?

00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:57.550 align:middle line:84%
So there's a sector and
household-specific talent

00:23:57.550 --> 00:24:01.450 align:middle line:84%
variable that's wrapped
up into these epsilons.

00:24:01.450 --> 00:24:03.370 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, if you're
talented, the epsilons

00:24:03.370 --> 00:24:06.220 align:middle line:84%
are going to tend to
be high, meaning output

00:24:06.220 --> 00:24:08.680 align:middle line:84%
is going to be high,
even controlling

00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:10.370 align:middle line:90%
for capital and labor.

00:24:10.370 --> 00:24:13.960 align:middle line:84%
So if you looked across
the sectors at, quote,

00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:18.020 align:middle line:84%
"sectoral productivity,"
they are pretty similar.

00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:19.990 align:middle line:84%
The highest one
here is livestock,

00:24:19.990 --> 00:24:22.510 align:middle line:90%
the lowest one is business.

00:24:22.510 --> 00:24:24.940 align:middle line:84%
Now, in terms of the
household-specific

00:24:24.940 --> 00:24:28.990 align:middle line:84%
productivities, there's a whole
cross sectional dispersion

00:24:28.990 --> 00:24:32.440 align:middle line:90%
of these zi's in each sector.

00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:36.820 align:middle line:84%
And so this sigma is a
characterization of the--

00:24:36.820 --> 00:24:39.760 align:middle line:84%
a bit like a variance
of the distribution.

00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:44.590 align:middle line:84%
The point being that each
household has a particular z

00:24:44.590 --> 00:24:47.200 align:middle line:84%
depending on the sector
in which they reside,

00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:50.470 align:middle line:84%
and they could be very talented
or not talented at all,

00:24:50.470 --> 00:24:53.270 align:middle line:84%
even though they're
engaged in that activity.

00:24:53.270 --> 00:24:55.120 align:middle line:84%
And these are
estimated in the data.

00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:57.220 align:middle line:84%
You're looking at
the actual numbers.

00:24:57.220 --> 00:25:00.610 align:middle line:84%
The other aspect of
heterogeneity here, in addition

00:25:00.610 --> 00:25:06.070 align:middle line:84%
to household talent, would be
their wealth or, specifically,

00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:07.820 align:middle line:90%
their fixed assets.

00:25:07.820 --> 00:25:09.440 align:middle line:84%
That's why I
emphasized it when we

00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:10.850 align:middle line:90%
went through the balance sheet.

00:25:10.850 --> 00:25:14.080 align:middle line:84%
And you can see the
cross-sectional distribution

00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:17.830 align:middle line:84%
in Lopburi, which
is near Bangkok,

00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:23.410 align:middle line:84%
versus the cross sectional
distribution in Buriram, which

00:25:23.410 --> 00:25:28.750 align:middle line:84%
has a lot more mass over here
to the left, meaning low assets.

00:25:28.750 --> 00:25:31.870 align:middle line:84%
So indeed, in the data,
Lopburi near Bangkok

00:25:31.870 --> 00:25:36.100 align:middle line:84%
has higher average fixed
assets than does Buriram out

00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:37.420 align:middle line:90%
in the Northeast.

00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:40.130 align:middle line:84%
But again, it is the
whole distribution.

00:25:40.130 --> 00:25:43.900 align:middle line:84%
So a given household could
have relatively little wealth

00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:46.600 align:middle line:84%
or have a lot of
wealth, even in Buriram.

00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:50.840 align:middle line:84%
This actually is consistent
with the Pauson, Townsend,

00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:54.970 align:middle line:84%
Karaivanov paper, which was
an application of mechanism

00:25:54.970 --> 00:26:00.100 align:middle line:84%
design, where we talked about
the talent of being a firm.

00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:02.650 align:middle line:90%
Theta, I think, we had it there.

00:26:02.650 --> 00:26:06.880 align:middle line:84%
And also, we talked
about assets separately.

00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:10.100 align:middle line:84%
And indeed, we talked about a
limited liability constraint,

00:26:10.100 --> 00:26:11.470 align:middle line:90%
which is coming up.

00:26:11.470 --> 00:26:14.590 align:middle line:84%
So we have this
cash thing, which,

00:26:14.590 --> 00:26:17.470 align:middle line:84%
as I was saying, from
your previous lecture,

00:26:17.470 --> 00:26:20.200 align:middle line:84%
you know cash holdings
don't behave very well.

00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:22.900 align:middle line:84%
So we just impose what
we see in the data,

00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:26.170 align:middle line:84%
that cash holdings, that
part of wealth that they're

00:26:26.170 --> 00:26:28.930 align:middle line:90%
putting into cash, is fixed.

00:26:28.930 --> 00:26:31.930 align:middle line:84%
It turns out that consumption
is related to that.

00:26:31.930 --> 00:26:35.950 align:middle line:84%
We imposed that consumption
is equal to an intercept

00:26:35.950 --> 00:26:38.740 align:middle line:84%
plus profits less
that intercept.

00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:42.170 align:middle line:84%
And gamma here has
to do with omega,

00:26:42.170 --> 00:26:45.220 align:middle line:84%
which is the fraction of
savings that put into cash.

00:26:45.220 --> 00:26:47.650 align:middle line:84%
I didn't put the algebra
in, which I probably

00:26:47.650 --> 00:26:50.410 align:middle line:84%
should have done, except
all I want to say from this

00:26:50.410 --> 00:26:54.760 align:middle line:84%
is the cash part of savings
is just fitted to the model.

00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:57.040 align:middle line:90%
It's not something we derived.

00:26:57.040 --> 00:27:00.340 align:middle line:84%
So now I want to go
back to those accounts

00:27:00.340 --> 00:27:04.330 align:middle line:84%
and show you where gross
national product comes

00:27:04.330 --> 00:27:07.090 align:middle line:84%
from, except that,
in this case, it's

00:27:07.090 --> 00:27:10.990 align:middle line:84%
going to be village-level
product and income.

00:27:10.990 --> 00:27:15.700 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll go on to flow
of funds, the balance sheet,

00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:17.750 align:middle line:90%
balance of payments, and so on.

00:27:17.750 --> 00:27:20.770 align:middle line:90%
So the top you've seen before.

00:27:20.770 --> 00:27:24.910 align:middle line:84%
That's the statement of
income, revenues less costs,

00:27:24.910 --> 00:27:28.850 align:middle line:84%
but now we start subtracting
things from both sides.

00:27:28.850 --> 00:27:32.410 align:middle line:84%
For example, to get rid of
capital gains, capital losses,

00:27:32.410 --> 00:27:35.980 align:middle line:84%
and indemnity, we
subtract them off,

00:27:35.980 --> 00:27:38.230 align:middle line:84%
and then they appear
with the opposite sign

00:27:38.230 --> 00:27:40.480 align:middle line:90%
on the left-hand side.

00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:43.690 align:middle line:84%
Likewise, we have expenses
from production, which

00:27:43.690 --> 00:27:45.520 align:middle line:90%
we subtract off of both sides.

00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:48.820 align:middle line:84%
Hence, it disappears on the
left hand side and reappears

00:27:48.820 --> 00:27:51.550 align:middle line:84%
on the right, and
it's subtracted.

00:27:51.550 --> 00:27:57.620 align:middle line:84%
So we end up with revenues
less expenses in production,

00:27:57.620 --> 00:27:59.350 align:middle line:90%
which we call output.

00:27:59.350 --> 00:28:03.140 align:middle line:84%
And on the left-hand side, we
have the disposition of output.

00:28:03.140 --> 00:28:05.290 align:middle line:90%
Output is used to pay interest.

00:28:05.290 --> 00:28:09.070 align:middle line:84%
It's used to pay
interest for capital.

00:28:09.070 --> 00:28:13.150 align:middle line:84%
Normally, you would see wages
paid to labor over here,

00:28:13.150 --> 00:28:15.470 align:middle line:84%
and I'll come back
to that momentarily.

00:28:15.470 --> 00:28:18.910 align:middle line:90%
And the residual is profits.

00:28:18.910 --> 00:28:25.360 align:middle line:84%
So all output gets paid, in the
sense of paying hired factors

00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:29.300 align:middle line:84%
or what's left over accruing
to the business owner.

00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:32.650 align:middle line:84%
So this is a classic
decomposition

00:28:32.650 --> 00:28:38.720 align:middle line:84%
of the national income accounts,
from production or from inputs.

00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:41.070 align:middle line:84%
We're really interested
in international trade,

00:28:41.070 --> 00:28:42.860 align:middle line:84%
so we're really
interested, here,

00:28:42.860 --> 00:28:47.120 align:middle line:84%
in how much is labor getting
paid, how much of the interest

00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:51.140 align:middle line:84%
being paid to capital, and so
on as a function of output,

00:28:51.140 --> 00:28:54.590 align:middle line:84%
just a bit like
the 2x2x2 lecture.

00:28:54.590 --> 00:28:56.660 align:middle line:84%
So if we're looking
at output, remember,

00:28:56.660 --> 00:29:00.110 align:middle line:84%
there are four villages
in each province that were

00:29:00.110 --> 00:29:02.360 align:middle line:90%
selected for the monthly data.

00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:04.460 align:middle line:84%
Here, you can
actually see output

00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:06.980 align:middle line:90%
going down in Chachoengsao--

00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:08.990 align:middle line:90%
wiggling, but going down--

00:29:08.990 --> 00:29:12.950 align:middle line:84%
whereas, in Buriram,
output is going up.

00:29:12.950 --> 00:29:15.260 align:middle line:84%
And these are the
other two provinces.

00:29:15.260 --> 00:29:19.340 align:middle line:84%
So another point to
make is that output

00:29:19.340 --> 00:29:21.110 align:middle line:84%
is different across
different villages,

00:29:21.110 --> 00:29:23.390 align:middle line:84%
even though they're
nearby to one another.

00:29:23.390 --> 00:29:25.940 align:middle line:84%
And also, you'll miss it
if I don't point it out,

00:29:25.940 --> 00:29:29.540 align:middle line:84%
probably, which is the
scale in the Northeast,

00:29:29.540 --> 00:29:33.590 align:middle line:84%
the maximum value is 6 and
5, whereas, in the central,

00:29:33.590 --> 00:29:36.170 align:middle line:90%
the maximum is 15 and 12.

00:29:36.170 --> 00:29:40.160 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, villages near
Bangkok have higher output

00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:44.180 align:middle line:84%
than villages in the Northeast,
but there remains heterogeneity

00:29:44.180 --> 00:29:48.050 align:middle line:84%
across the villages, and
you see the ups and downs.

00:29:48.050 --> 00:29:51.050 align:middle line:84%
The shrimp ponds got
hit with a bad shock

00:29:51.050 --> 00:29:53.390 align:middle line:84%
that we've talked about
previously in the network

00:29:53.390 --> 00:29:55.730 align:middle line:90%
lecture under risk-sharing.

00:29:55.730 --> 00:29:59.990 align:middle line:84%
So that's part of the decline
in output in Chachoengsao.

00:29:59.990 --> 00:30:03.050 align:middle line:84%
Buriram used to be
a bunch of villages.

00:30:03.050 --> 00:30:07.740 align:middle line:84%
We put rain gauges out there
to measure waterfall and so on.

00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:11.510 align:middle line:84%
And then it experienced a
boom, and those villages

00:30:11.510 --> 00:30:13.310 align:middle line:90%
were subsumed by the town.

00:30:13.310 --> 00:30:16.160 align:middle line:84%
And you can see that
expansion pretty dramatically

00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:18.050 align:middle line:90%
in this output diagram.

00:30:18.050 --> 00:30:21.770 align:middle line:84%
And as I was saying,
we can decompose output

00:30:21.770 --> 00:30:23.420 align:middle line:90%
into who gets it.

00:30:23.420 --> 00:30:28.760 align:middle line:84%
And you can see here, wages,
which is the darkest line,

00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:31.670 align:middle line:84%
is the bigger part
of the disposition

00:30:31.670 --> 00:30:33.050 align:middle line:90%
of output in Buriram.

00:30:33.050 --> 00:30:36.740 align:middle line:84%
In Sisaket, wages
are not as much--

00:30:36.740 --> 00:30:41.390 align:middle line:84%
they're not trivial
near Bangkok--

00:30:41.390 --> 00:30:42.950 align:middle line:90%
Chachoengsao and Lopburi.

00:30:42.950 --> 00:30:46.670 align:middle line:84%
Instead, we have
these two sectors,

00:30:46.670 --> 00:30:49.760 align:middle line:84%
the labor-intensive
agricultural sector

00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:53.930 align:middle line:84%
and the capital-intensive
manufacturing sector

00:30:53.930 --> 00:30:56.750 align:middle line:84%
as sometimes having
profit shares which

00:30:56.750 --> 00:30:59.030 align:middle line:90%
are higher than the wages.

00:30:59.030 --> 00:31:01.940 align:middle line:84%
Now we come to the savings
investment account.

00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:04.590 align:middle line:84%
We take the balance
sheet at a point in time,

00:31:04.590 --> 00:31:06.360 align:middle line:84%
and we take the
first difference.

00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:09.230 align:middle line:84%
So now we'll have the change in
liabilities, the change the net

00:31:09.230 --> 00:31:12.650 align:middle line:84%
worth on the right, change in
financial and real physical

00:31:12.650 --> 00:31:14.520 align:middle line:90%
assets on the left.

00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:18.020 align:middle line:84%
We now go through this thing
about subtracting items

00:31:18.020 --> 00:31:20.220 align:middle line:84%
on the left and the
right-hand side.

00:31:20.220 --> 00:31:23.540 align:middle line:84%
We leave the change in net
worth on the right-hand side

00:31:23.540 --> 00:31:25.670 align:middle line:84%
and the disposition
of that change

00:31:25.670 --> 00:31:30.140 align:middle line:84%
into an increase in
financial or real assets

00:31:30.140 --> 00:31:33.540 align:middle line:90%
or a decrease in liabilities.

00:31:33.540 --> 00:31:37.040 align:middle line:84%
So we can see they're
managing their portfolio,

00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:39.732 align:middle line:84%
in an accounting sense,
as a function of,

00:31:39.732 --> 00:31:40.940 align:middle line:90%
what do they do with savings.

00:31:40.940 --> 00:31:44.990 align:middle line:84%
And likewise, if savings are
negative because they consume

00:31:44.990 --> 00:31:48.710 align:middle line:84%
more than they earn, then they
have to draw that value out

00:31:48.710 --> 00:31:51.120 align:middle line:90%
of something or borrow.

00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:53.480 align:middle line:84%
So this is the
allocation of savings

00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:55.430 align:middle line:90%
across the four provinces.

00:31:55.430 --> 00:31:59.480 align:middle line:84%
The darkest line here is
savings, which is largely going

00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:01.370 align:middle line:90%
up, although not entirely.

00:32:01.370 --> 00:32:03.800 align:middle line:84%
Savings is going down
and Chachoengsao,

00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:05.600 align:middle line:84%
as you might have
expected, since they

00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:08.810 align:middle line:84%
got to finance those
losses, that declining

00:32:08.810 --> 00:32:10.040 align:middle line:90%
output from somewhere.

00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:13.700 align:middle line:84%
They're preserving consumption
by taking it out of savings.

00:32:13.700 --> 00:32:18.230 align:middle line:84%
Likewise, they can save
in the fixed assets,

00:32:18.230 --> 00:32:20.390 align:middle line:90%
save in the financial assets.

00:32:20.390 --> 00:32:23.900 align:middle line:84%
The thing that tracks
the best overall--

00:32:23.900 --> 00:32:27.020 align:middle line:84%
tracks dark savings
overall, the best--

00:32:27.020 --> 00:32:28.070 align:middle line:90%
is financial.

00:32:28.070 --> 00:32:31.220 align:middle line:84%
And you can see in
most of these diagrams,

00:32:31.220 --> 00:32:35.520 align:middle line:84%
the black dotted lines are
close to the solid black line.

00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:40.430 align:middle line:84%
So financial assets increase
when savings is positive,

00:32:40.430 --> 00:32:43.670 align:middle line:84%
but these other real
and physical stuff

00:32:43.670 --> 00:32:45.500 align:middle line:90%
as well as gifts play a role.

00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:48.290 align:middle line:84%
Gifts are not trivial
in these economies,

00:32:48.290 --> 00:32:51.880 align:middle line:84%
as you already know from
thinking about insurance and so

00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:52.380 align:middle line:90%
on.

00:32:52.380 --> 00:32:55.610 align:middle line:90%
So all these things add up.

00:32:55.610 --> 00:32:58.250 align:middle line:84%
Gifts, financial
transfers, inventory,

00:32:58.250 --> 00:33:00.410 align:middle line:90%
and so on add up to savings.

00:33:00.410 --> 00:33:04.290 align:middle line:84%
But gifts could be negative,
because they're not incoming,

00:33:04.290 --> 00:33:05.600 align:middle line:90%
but they're outgoing.

00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:06.620 align:middle line:90%
They're not saving it.

00:33:06.620 --> 00:33:08.090 align:middle line:90%
They're giving it away.

00:33:08.090 --> 00:33:09.560 align:middle line:90%
It's not always negative.

00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:12.000 align:middle line:84%
Gifts are positive,
in some instances.

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:16.740 align:middle line:84%
But in any event, they're not
a trivial order of magnitude,

00:33:16.740 --> 00:33:19.430 align:middle line:84%
and we will look at
that subsequently again.

00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:22.520 align:middle line:84%
In terms of financial
flows, you've

00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:25.670 align:middle line:84%
got something called
the current account.

00:33:25.670 --> 00:33:29.060 align:middle line:84%
For the US, for example, are
they running a trade balance,

00:33:29.060 --> 00:33:31.460 align:middle line:84%
or are they earning
money from abroad?

00:33:31.460 --> 00:33:33.860 align:middle line:84%
And likewise, for
these villages,

00:33:33.860 --> 00:33:36.110 align:middle line:90%
they export and import stuff.

00:33:36.110 --> 00:33:39.960 align:middle line:84%
We take the trade balance as
the difference if positive.

00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:41.610 align:middle line:90%
Exports exceed imports.

00:33:41.610 --> 00:33:44.430 align:middle line:84%
And likewise, some
member of the household

00:33:44.430 --> 00:33:47.670 align:middle line:84%
is in Bangkok and earning
money and sending that money

00:33:47.670 --> 00:33:52.800 align:middle line:84%
back home as a gift, that's
factor income earned abroad.

00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:55.740 align:middle line:84%
In China, people work
in the Philippines

00:33:55.740 --> 00:33:57.360 align:middle line:90%
and send money back home.

00:33:57.360 --> 00:33:59.950 align:middle line:84%
So this is called
the current account.

00:33:59.950 --> 00:34:04.320 align:middle line:84%
Now, there are corresponding
items, offsetting items,

00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:06.630 align:middle line:90%
on the financial account.

00:34:06.630 --> 00:34:09.630 align:middle line:84%
Basically, if you're
running a trade surplus,

00:34:09.630 --> 00:34:12.210 align:middle line:84%
you're acquiring
claims on foreigners,

00:34:12.210 --> 00:34:14.790 align:middle line:84%
which could be by
holding their currency,

00:34:14.790 --> 00:34:18.210 align:middle line:84%
holding their financial assets,
or holding their real assets.

00:34:18.210 --> 00:34:20.880 align:middle line:84%
And as we'll talk
about next time,

00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:23.370 align:middle line:84%
the US has been
running a trade deficit

00:34:23.370 --> 00:34:27.989 align:middle line:84%
with China, which means China
is acquiring claims on the US,

00:34:27.989 --> 00:34:31.929 align:middle line:84%
holding US treasuries,
real estate, and so on.

00:34:31.929 --> 00:34:34.350 align:middle line:84%
So the names change to
protect the innocent,

00:34:34.350 --> 00:34:36.900 align:middle line:84%
in the sense of we're not
looking at countries here.

00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:39.690 align:middle line:84%
We're looking at villages, but
we're doing all the accounting

00:34:39.690 --> 00:34:42.090 align:middle line:84%
for the villages
the way it's done

00:34:42.090 --> 00:34:46.409 align:middle line:84%
for countries, with exactly
the same accounting identities.

00:34:46.409 --> 00:34:49.469 align:middle line:84%
And the point of all of
this is only to tell you

00:34:49.469 --> 00:34:51.570 align:middle line:84%
where some of these things
that you've heard of

00:34:51.570 --> 00:34:52.530 align:middle line:90%
are coming from.

00:34:52.530 --> 00:34:55.590 align:middle line:84%
From the ground up, from
each and every household,

00:34:55.590 --> 00:34:58.680 align:middle line:84%
we have the financial
accounts-- income statement,

00:34:58.680 --> 00:35:00.180 align:middle line:90%
balance sheet, and so on.

00:35:00.180 --> 00:35:03.960 align:middle line:84%
We can add it up over all
households in the village,

00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:09.550 align:middle line:84%
as the sample allows, and get
the village-level aggregates.

00:35:09.550 --> 00:35:11.520 align:middle line:90%
This is for all of Thailand.

00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:15.420 align:middle line:84%
Thailand was running
a trade deficit,

00:35:15.420 --> 00:35:18.780 align:middle line:84%
and foreigners were
acquiring claims on Thailand

00:35:18.780 --> 00:35:23.550 align:middle line:84%
until the 1997 financial crisis,
in which case, things reversed.

00:35:23.550 --> 00:35:26.940 align:middle line:84%
And they've been a bit
unstable ever since.

00:35:26.940 --> 00:35:29.310 align:middle line:84%
In this case,
balance of payments

00:35:29.310 --> 00:35:33.630 align:middle line:84%
are roughly a certain
of GDP, maybe 10%.

00:35:33.630 --> 00:35:34.530 align:middle line:90%
That's a big number.

00:35:34.530 --> 00:35:36.990 align:middle line:90%
It's typically 5%.

00:35:36.990 --> 00:35:39.720 align:middle line:84%
So when we come to
villages, you might ask,

00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:41.740 align:middle line:90%
how big are these flows?

00:35:41.740 --> 00:35:44.490 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is,
typically, much bigger.

00:35:44.490 --> 00:35:48.450 align:middle line:84%
For example, in Chachoengsao,
the balance of payments,

00:35:48.450 --> 00:35:51.060 align:middle line:84%
including the trade and
the current account,

00:35:51.060 --> 00:35:54.510 align:middle line:90%
can be as high as 20% of GDP.

00:35:54.510 --> 00:35:58.450 align:middle line:84%
And Lopburi, likewise
reaches 15% of GDP.

00:35:58.450 --> 00:36:00.820 align:middle line:84%
So they are small
open economies.

00:36:00.820 --> 00:36:05.400 align:middle line:84%
These villages are engaged
with the rest of the country.

00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:07.260 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, we
can break that down

00:36:07.260 --> 00:36:10.380 align:middle line:84%
into the gifts, which I
showed you a moment ago,

00:36:10.380 --> 00:36:15.030 align:middle line:84%
as well as, here, the
measure of openness

00:36:15.030 --> 00:36:18.850 align:middle line:84%
in terms of trade, which
is exports minus imports.

00:36:18.850 --> 00:36:22.860 align:middle line:84%
So roughly, Chachoengsao
near Bangkok, its imports

00:36:22.860 --> 00:36:27.370 align:middle line:84%
and exports are almost
matching one another.

00:36:27.370 --> 00:36:30.420 align:middle line:84%
Whereas, out in the
Northeast, the imports

00:36:30.420 --> 00:36:33.450 align:middle line:84%
are a lot bigger
than the exports.

00:36:33.450 --> 00:36:35.610 align:middle line:90%
The imports are for production.

00:36:35.610 --> 00:36:38.160 align:middle line:84%
They're inputs acquired
for production,

00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:41.160 align:middle line:84%
and they export a little
bit of their output.

00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:46.330 align:middle line:84%
They eat a lot of the rice that
they produce and export less.

00:36:46.330 --> 00:36:49.210 align:middle line:84%
I'm getting ready to
show you the model.

00:36:49.210 --> 00:36:51.760 align:middle line:84%
One, what about
the relative price?

00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:53.290 align:middle line:84%
At the beginning
of this class, we

00:36:53.290 --> 00:36:57.070 align:middle line:84%
talked about the price of
good 1 the price of good 2.

00:36:57.070 --> 00:37:00.370 align:middle line:84%
We have two sectors for
simplicity, agriculture

00:37:00.370 --> 00:37:01.960 align:middle line:90%
and manufacturing.

00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:05.380 align:middle line:84%
So from the data, we can
actually see, overall,

00:37:05.380 --> 00:37:08.590 align:middle line:84%
that the price of the
agricultural good is going up,

00:37:08.590 --> 00:37:12.130 align:middle line:84%
the ratio is going down,
from the standpoint

00:37:12.130 --> 00:37:16.180 align:middle line:84%
of a typical village, with
the possibility of imports

00:37:16.180 --> 00:37:20.800 align:middle line:84%
and exports, just the way we
had countries possibly exporting

00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:22.720 align:middle line:90%
and importing to each other.

00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:26.890 align:middle line:84%
In terms of the factor prices,
remember the minimized cost

00:37:26.890 --> 00:37:27.520 align:middle line:90%
curve?

00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:29.150 align:middle line:90%
Well, this is over time.

00:37:29.150 --> 00:37:32.410 align:middle line:84%
So we can see the wage
rate and the interest rate,

00:37:32.410 --> 00:37:36.010 align:middle line:84%
both adjusted to be in
units of consumption.

00:37:36.010 --> 00:37:38.800 align:middle line:84%
Hence, real values
as a numerator.

00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:44.920 align:middle line:84%
So in the areas near Bangkok,
the blue and the red,

00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:48.940 align:middle line:84%
we can see that wages
tend to be higher

00:37:48.940 --> 00:37:51.430 align:middle line:90%
than they are in the Northeast.

00:37:51.430 --> 00:37:53.680 align:middle line:84%
Now, near Bangkok,
you would think

00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:56.050 align:middle line:84%
this is relatively
capital-abundant,

00:37:56.050 --> 00:37:59.440 align:middle line:84%
because they're pretty
industrialized and short

00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:00.850 align:middle line:90%
of labor.

00:38:00.850 --> 00:38:03.970 align:middle line:84%
So indeed, the relative
price of labor to capital

00:38:03.970 --> 00:38:08.260 align:middle line:84%
is higher in the
areas near Bangkok,

00:38:08.260 --> 00:38:11.350 align:middle line:84%
reflecting the capital abundance
and the relative shortage

00:38:11.350 --> 00:38:12.310 align:middle line:90%
of labor.

00:38:12.310 --> 00:38:14.770 align:middle line:84%
The reverse is true
in the Northeast.

00:38:14.770 --> 00:38:17.530 align:middle line:84%
And also, we can look at
the interest rate, which

00:38:17.530 --> 00:38:19.450 align:middle line:90%
is like the price of capital.

00:38:19.450 --> 00:38:24.280 align:middle line:84%
And again, you can see that
now the blue and the red

00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:27.490 align:middle line:84%
are at the bottom, because
places near Bangkok

00:38:27.490 --> 00:38:29.080 align:middle line:90%
are capital-abundant.

00:38:29.080 --> 00:38:32.090 align:middle line:84%
And so the interest
rates tend to be low.

00:38:32.090 --> 00:38:35.110 align:middle line:84%
We did this experiment for
the Heckscher-Ohlin model.

00:38:35.110 --> 00:38:37.780 align:middle line:84%
Countries that are relatively
abundant in a factor

00:38:37.780 --> 00:38:41.410 align:middle line:84%
should be exporting the
good which uses that factor

00:38:41.410 --> 00:38:43.340 align:middle line:90%
relatively intensively.

00:38:43.340 --> 00:38:47.500 align:middle line:84%
So you can imagine that
places near Bangkok

00:38:47.500 --> 00:38:50.080 align:middle line:84%
that are abundant in
capital will have a tendency

00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:52.390 align:middle line:84%
to export the
manufactured goods,

00:38:52.390 --> 00:38:55.210 align:middle line:84%
because that's the one
that's intensive in capital.

00:38:55.210 --> 00:38:57.100 align:middle line:90%
What am I doing today?

00:38:57.100 --> 00:39:01.990 align:middle line:84%
I'm just getting the labels to
be realistic in actual context,

00:39:01.990 --> 00:39:04.645 align:middle line:90%
realistic relative to last time.

00:39:04.645 --> 00:39:06.040 align:middle line:90%
We learned the theory first.

00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:09.340 align:middle line:84%
Now we're applying it, although
with some modifications.

00:39:09.340 --> 00:39:11.860 align:middle line:84%
The other thing you can
see here is the interest

00:39:11.860 --> 00:39:13.420 align:middle line:90%
rates are converging.

00:39:13.420 --> 00:39:16.310 align:middle line:84%
They're getting really close
to one another over time.

00:39:16.310 --> 00:39:20.260 align:middle line:84%
So one imagines that if
they could [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:20.260 --> 00:39:21.790 align:middle line:90%
trade in inputs.

00:39:21.790 --> 00:39:23.140 align:middle line:90%
Not just outputs.

00:39:23.140 --> 00:39:25.840 align:middle line:84%
It's pretty easy to do
that with a capital input.

00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:28.730 align:middle line:84%
But the wage rates
are not converging,

00:39:28.730 --> 00:39:31.810 align:middle line:84%
so that's also a hint
that, like the 2x2 model,

00:39:31.810 --> 00:39:37.260 align:middle line:84%
we're not going to allow labor
to be moving across borders.

00:39:37.260 --> 00:39:41.387 align:middle line:84%
OK, so I'm going to show you the
ingredients for a small open,

00:39:41.387 --> 00:39:42.970 align:middle line:84%
economy and then I'm
going to tell you

00:39:42.970 --> 00:39:46.910 align:middle line:84%
what the difference is with a
2x2x2 that we did last time.

00:39:46.910 --> 00:39:49.180 align:middle line:90%
So it is 2x2--

00:39:49.180 --> 00:39:51.460 align:middle line:90%
2 goods, 2 factors--

00:39:51.460 --> 00:39:54.958 align:middle line:84%
although it's a village relative
to the rest of the country.

00:39:54.958 --> 00:39:56.500 align:middle line:84%
Different from last
time, we're going

00:39:56.500 --> 00:40:00.640 align:middle line:84%
to have financial frictions,
like those borrowing-to-wealth

00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:01.900 align:middle line:90%
ratios.

00:40:01.900 --> 00:40:05.050 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
agents in each village,

00:40:05.050 --> 00:40:08.200 align:middle line:84%
and they differ in their
wealth and ability levels.

00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:12.130 align:middle line:84%
They can choose to be workers
or they could become a firm.

00:40:12.130 --> 00:40:13.990 align:middle line:84%
And if they're an
entrepreneur, they

00:40:13.990 --> 00:40:17.860 align:middle line:84%
could be in the manufacturing
or agricultural sector.

00:40:17.860 --> 00:40:21.090 align:middle line:90%
So that's one of the two 2s--

00:40:21.090 --> 00:40:26.260 align:middle line:84%
two goods, agriculture and
manufacturing, two inputs,

00:40:26.260 --> 00:40:30.010 align:middle line:84%
capital and labor, with the
factor intensities different.

00:40:30.010 --> 00:40:35.260 align:middle line:84%
Labor is owned by households
and supplied inelastically,

00:40:35.260 --> 00:40:37.210 align:middle line:90%
like it was last time.

00:40:37.210 --> 00:40:39.340 align:middle line:90%
They get this wage w.

00:40:39.340 --> 00:40:44.770 align:middle line:84%
Wealth is owned by households
and supplied at an interest

00:40:44.770 --> 00:40:47.800 align:middle line:84%
rate, but it's also
changing over time.

00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:50.680 align:middle line:84%
Unlike what we had
last time, we've

00:40:50.680 --> 00:40:54.700 align:middle line:84%
got dynamics in a way
to save money over time.

00:40:54.700 --> 00:40:57.940 align:middle line:84%
They can use their capital,
or they can lend it out.

00:40:57.940 --> 00:41:00.310 align:middle line:84%
So we have a borrowing
and lending market,

00:41:00.310 --> 00:41:02.920 align:middle line:84%
but that capital
market is imperfect.

00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:07.420 align:middle line:84%
Namely, you can't necessarily
use an unlimited amount

00:41:07.420 --> 00:41:08.980 align:middle line:90%
of capital k.

00:41:08.980 --> 00:41:11.660 align:middle line:90%
You're bounded by your wealth.

00:41:11.660 --> 00:41:14.540 align:middle line:84%
So that, for the
third time today,

00:41:14.540 --> 00:41:17.970 align:middle line:84%
is mention of the limited
liability constraints.

00:41:17.970 --> 00:41:20.810 align:middle line:84%
So the differences
with last time,

00:41:20.810 --> 00:41:23.630 align:middle line:84%
we have decreasing
returns to scale,

00:41:23.630 --> 00:41:26.120 align:middle line:84%
whereas, last time,
in the theory lecture,

00:41:26.120 --> 00:41:29.180 align:middle line:84%
we used and abused
the fact that it

00:41:29.180 --> 00:41:31.610 align:middle line:90%
was constant returns to scale--

00:41:31.610 --> 00:41:34.730 align:middle line:84%
hence, unit costs
of production, which

00:41:34.730 --> 00:41:37.820 align:middle line:84%
scale up and down depending
on the level of production.

00:41:37.820 --> 00:41:41.870 align:middle line:84%
Factor mobility is
somewhat limited here,

00:41:41.870 --> 00:41:45.500 align:middle line:84%
but the capital good moves
around, unlike last time.

00:41:45.500 --> 00:41:49.850 align:middle line:84%
We have financial variables
here and real variables,

00:41:49.850 --> 00:41:53.300 align:middle line:84%
whereas, last time, we
only had real variables.

00:41:53.300 --> 00:41:56.420 align:middle line:84%
And likewise, here, we
have borrowing constraints.

00:41:56.420 --> 00:41:59.160 align:middle line:84%
And last time, we
didn't have any of that.

00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:02.790 align:middle line:84%
But this model does have
the different endowments

00:42:02.790 --> 00:42:04.120 align:middle line:90%
of the factors.

00:42:04.120 --> 00:42:07.620 align:middle line:84%
It does have the different
factor intensities.

00:42:07.620 --> 00:42:10.020 align:middle line:90%
It keeps the 2x2x2--

00:42:10.020 --> 00:42:13.320 align:middle line:84%
well, 2x2 anyway with
small open economy.

00:42:13.320 --> 00:42:17.700 align:middle line:84%
And so part of what you're
going to see in the simulations

00:42:17.700 --> 00:42:21.160 align:middle line:84%
reflects what we
learned last time.

00:42:21.160 --> 00:42:23.010 align:middle line:84%
And part of it is
a bit different,

00:42:23.010 --> 00:42:29.070 align:middle line:84%
because it has a few
additional realistic features.

00:42:29.070 --> 00:42:32.250 align:middle line:84%
Rather than take you
through the entire model,

00:42:32.250 --> 00:42:36.000 align:middle line:84%
I'll just give you the
notation at the beginning.

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:40.410 align:middle line:84%
Each entrepreneur
can produce sector a,

00:42:40.410 --> 00:42:43.680 align:middle line:84%
which could be agriculture,
but it's also manufacturing.

00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:48.690 align:middle line:84%
A household has a certain talent
level z and an initial capital

00:42:48.690 --> 00:42:49.470 align:middle line:90%
stock.

00:42:49.470 --> 00:42:55.140 align:middle line:84%
It will use its inputs,
capital and higher labor,

00:42:55.140 --> 00:42:58.080 align:middle line:84%
at its productivity
level, selling it

00:42:58.080 --> 00:42:59.880 align:middle line:90%
for the price of output.

00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:03.780 align:middle line:84%
But it has to pay input
costs for capital and labor,

00:43:03.780 --> 00:43:06.510 align:middle line:84%
and the input
prices are r and w.

00:43:06.510 --> 00:43:08.760 align:middle line:90%
So you've seen this many times.

00:43:08.760 --> 00:43:11.850 align:middle line:84%
This is just a statement
of profits for a firm.

00:43:11.850 --> 00:43:15.090 align:middle line:84%
It happens to be a firm
owned and entirely operated

00:43:15.090 --> 00:43:19.560 align:middle line:84%
by a given household, because
the theta ij equals 1.

00:43:19.560 --> 00:43:21.840 align:middle line:84%
And here's the
borrowing constraint.

00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:26.280 align:middle line:84%
Capital utilized is limited
by the pre-existing stock

00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:29.160 align:middle line:84%
of fixed assets
[INAUDIBLE] this constant c

00:43:29.160 --> 00:43:31.380 align:middle line:84%
could be greater
than 1, which allows

00:43:31.380 --> 00:43:36.210 align:middle line:84%
them to borrow, to acquire fixed
assets and production greater

00:43:36.210 --> 00:43:38.640 align:middle line:90%
than what they already own.

00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:40.950 align:middle line:90%
Labor is non-negative.

00:43:40.950 --> 00:43:44.310 align:middle line:84%
As in that paper with
Anna Palson and Karaivanov

00:43:44.310 --> 00:43:47.820 align:middle line:84%
they could choose to be a wage
earner, put all their wealth--

00:43:47.820 --> 00:43:51.390 align:middle line:84%
lend it out, basically,
earn interest on it,

00:43:51.390 --> 00:43:54.240 align:middle line:84%
or they earn money from
being a wage earner.

00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:56.850 align:middle line:84%
Likewise, we have profits
for agriculturalists

00:43:56.850 --> 00:43:58.470 align:middle line:90%
and manufacturers.

00:43:58.470 --> 00:44:02.130 align:middle line:84%
And they're, in principle,
lending stuff out,

00:44:02.130 --> 00:44:04.320 align:middle line:84%
but they could be
borrowing some of it

00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:06.460 align:middle line:90%
back to finance production.

00:44:06.460 --> 00:44:09.210 align:middle line:84%
And then we have a
utility over consumption

00:44:09.210 --> 00:44:12.360 align:middle line:84%
of agriculture and
manufactured goods, which

00:44:12.360 --> 00:44:17.310 align:middle line:84%
looks this Cobb-Douglas thing,
where these etas are cleverly

00:44:17.310 --> 00:44:21.270 align:middle line:84%
chosen to allow us to talk
about aggregate savings.

00:44:21.270 --> 00:44:22.920 align:middle line:84%
Because, in fact,
there's capital

00:44:22.920 --> 00:44:26.460 align:middle line:84%
in manufacturing and
capital in agriculture,

00:44:26.460 --> 00:44:28.260 align:middle line:84%
and we don't want to
keep having to refer

00:44:28.260 --> 00:44:31.080 align:middle line:84%
to the distinction about
where they're saving.

00:44:31.080 --> 00:44:33.690 align:middle line:84%
So we come up with
this ideal price index.

00:44:33.690 --> 00:44:35.570 align:middle line:90%
Don't worry about it too much.

00:44:35.570 --> 00:44:36.600 align:middle line:90%
It exists.

00:44:36.600 --> 00:44:39.934 align:middle line:90%
That's all we need to know.

00:44:39.934 --> 00:44:43.270 align:middle line:90%
OK, it's a small open economy.

00:44:43.270 --> 00:44:46.090 align:middle line:84%
Households have their
capital endowment.

00:44:46.090 --> 00:44:49.510 align:middle line:84%
We fit a distribution
that fits pretty well,

00:44:49.510 --> 00:44:52.330 align:middle line:84%
relative to the histograms
I've already shown you.

00:44:52.330 --> 00:44:54.700 align:middle line:90%
We have the labor endowments.

00:44:54.700 --> 00:44:56.900 align:middle line:90%
We know how much time they have.

00:44:56.900 --> 00:44:58.930 align:middle line:84%
We give them a
little bit of sleep

00:44:58.930 --> 00:45:01.090 align:middle line:84%
and come up with how
many units of labor

00:45:01.090 --> 00:45:05.290 align:middle line:84%
they can supply over the year,
which is fixed and exogenous.

00:45:05.290 --> 00:45:06.830 align:middle line:90%
Then they have a savings rate.

00:45:06.830 --> 00:45:10.150 align:middle line:84%
Which, again, as I already
said, that was an omega.

00:45:10.150 --> 00:45:12.760 align:middle line:90%
We fit to match the data.

00:45:12.760 --> 00:45:16.690 align:middle line:84%
I mentioned that, in the
context of the cash holdings,

00:45:16.690 --> 00:45:19.720 align:middle line:84%
one could imagine having
these households solve

00:45:19.720 --> 00:45:22.510 align:middle line:84%
discounted expected
utility maximization

00:45:22.510 --> 00:45:25.210 align:middle line:84%
problems over
their lifetime that

00:45:25.210 --> 00:45:27.320 align:middle line:90%
adds a lot to the complication.

00:45:27.320 --> 00:45:30.550 align:middle line:84%
So instead of doing that,
we just basically impose

00:45:30.550 --> 00:45:33.550 align:middle line:84%
from the data onto
the households

00:45:33.550 --> 00:45:35.900 align:middle line:90%
an estimated savings rate.

00:45:35.900 --> 00:45:38.050 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is a kind of
interesting diagram,

00:45:38.050 --> 00:45:42.460 align:middle line:84%
because all these parameters,
like the factor intensity

00:45:42.460 --> 00:45:45.490 align:middle line:84%
numbers and everything
else, are going

00:45:45.490 --> 00:45:49.780 align:middle line:84%
to be calibrated, which I'll
tell you about momentarily.

00:45:49.780 --> 00:45:53.750 align:middle line:84%
And we will generate
pictures like this.

00:45:53.750 --> 00:45:56.830 align:middle line:84%
So I mentioned the
calibration, only because you

00:45:56.830 --> 00:45:58.690 align:middle line:90%
can draw any picture you want.

00:45:58.690 --> 00:46:01.690 align:middle line:84%
But this is what it's going
to look like after the work is

00:46:01.690 --> 00:46:03.640 align:middle line:90%
done of estimation.

00:46:03.640 --> 00:46:06.550 align:middle line:84%
Over here, we have
low-wealth households

00:46:06.550 --> 00:46:08.830 align:middle line:90%
versus high-wealth households.

00:46:08.830 --> 00:46:10.690 align:middle line:84%
The other dimension
of heterogeneity

00:46:10.690 --> 00:46:14.230 align:middle line:84%
is low talent
versus high talent.

00:46:14.230 --> 00:46:17.002 align:middle line:84%
And you can see if
they're not very talented,

00:46:17.002 --> 00:46:19.210 align:middle line:84%
they're not going to go into
either type of business.

00:46:19.210 --> 00:46:21.110 align:middle line:90%
They're going to be workers.

00:46:21.110 --> 00:46:25.330 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand, if talent
reaches a higher level,

00:46:25.330 --> 00:46:29.650 align:middle line:84%
they could decide to go into
manufacturing or agriculture.

00:46:29.650 --> 00:46:32.500 align:middle line:84%
And then for a given
level of wealth,

00:46:32.500 --> 00:46:35.530 align:middle line:84%
they may be constrained
or unconstrained.

00:46:35.530 --> 00:46:38.440 align:middle line:84%
Ironically, the more
talented they are,

00:46:38.440 --> 00:46:41.502 align:middle line:84%
given a certain borrowing
constraint and their wealth,

00:46:41.502 --> 00:46:43.210 align:middle line:84%
the more constrained
they're going to be,

00:46:43.210 --> 00:46:44.627 align:middle line:84%
because they would
like to do more

00:46:44.627 --> 00:46:46.840 align:middle line:84%
and they're not
allowed to do it.

00:46:46.840 --> 00:46:49.660 align:middle line:84%
And here, it actually
moves from being

00:46:49.660 --> 00:46:52.600 align:middle line:84%
constrained in
manufacturing to being

00:46:52.600 --> 00:46:55.020 align:middle line:90%
constrained in agriculture.

00:46:55.020 --> 00:46:57.240 align:middle line:84%
So it's the really,
really talented guys

00:46:57.240 --> 00:47:01.350 align:middle line:84%
who are sticking on the farm,
given the parameters that we

00:47:01.350 --> 00:47:02.920 align:middle line:90%
estimated.

00:47:02.920 --> 00:47:04.100 align:middle line:90%
This I've already said.

00:47:04.100 --> 00:47:06.670 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have an
open market for capital,

00:47:06.670 --> 00:47:09.310 align:middle line:90%
but a closed market for labor.

00:47:09.310 --> 00:47:11.810 align:middle line:84%
And again, that's because the
interest rates are converging.

00:47:11.810 --> 00:47:13.570 align:middle line:84%
So it looks like, in
the end, at least,

00:47:13.570 --> 00:47:18.340 align:middle line:84%
capital can be moved across
provinces without a cost.

00:47:18.340 --> 00:47:21.400 align:middle line:84%
Here's, finally, the
calibration slide.

00:47:21.400 --> 00:47:24.970 align:middle line:84%
We have to figure out
the relative prices.

00:47:24.970 --> 00:47:26.860 align:middle line:90%
We need the interest rate.

00:47:26.860 --> 00:47:29.080 align:middle line:84%
We're going to take
it as exogenous.

00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:31.420 align:middle line:84%
The relative price
of manufacturing

00:47:31.420 --> 00:47:34.810 align:middle line:84%
versus agriculture we're
going to take as exogenous

00:47:34.810 --> 00:47:39.940 align:middle line:84%
and match it up with what we
see in the data as exogenous.

00:47:39.940 --> 00:47:42.590 align:middle line:84%
I'll come back to how
we pick it in a minute.

00:47:42.590 --> 00:47:45.820 align:middle line:84%
And the borrowing
rates are exogenous.

00:47:45.820 --> 00:47:47.650 align:middle line:84%
We stick in, for
the interest rate,

00:47:47.650 --> 00:47:49.510 align:middle line:90%
what we observe in the data.

00:47:49.510 --> 00:47:52.090 align:middle line:84%
We don't know about this
relative price of the borrowing

00:47:52.090 --> 00:47:57.670 align:middle line:84%
limit, but we do have the
profit sharing in each sector.

00:47:57.670 --> 00:48:02.180 align:middle line:84%
So we move the relative prices
to match the profit share.

00:48:02.180 --> 00:48:07.660 align:middle line:84%
So for example, if
agriculture has a price pa

00:48:07.660 --> 00:48:12.430 align:middle line:84%
and we observe a large
relative share of profits

00:48:12.430 --> 00:48:16.000 align:middle line:84%
from agriculture,
then we imagine

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:19.870 align:middle line:84%
that it's a relatively high
price of the agricultural goods

00:48:19.870 --> 00:48:23.560 align:middle line:84%
relative to the manufacturing
goods and vice versa.

00:48:23.560 --> 00:48:27.280 align:middle line:84%
Likewise, we're going to move
the borrowing limit to match

00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:29.410 align:middle line:90%
the observed wage rate.

00:48:29.410 --> 00:48:33.140 align:middle line:84%
The point being that if
they can't borrow very much,

00:48:33.140 --> 00:48:36.190 align:middle line:84%
they're not going to have a
very high scale of production.

00:48:36.190 --> 00:48:37.930 align:middle line:84%
They're not going to
hire a lot of labor.

00:48:37.930 --> 00:48:40.750 align:middle line:84%
The demand for labor
being low means

00:48:40.750 --> 00:48:43.840 align:middle line:84%
the wage that has to
clear the local market

00:48:43.840 --> 00:48:45.520 align:middle line:90%
is going to be low.

00:48:45.520 --> 00:48:48.010 align:middle line:84%
The bigger picture
here is calibration.

00:48:48.010 --> 00:48:51.910 align:middle line:84%
You have objects that
matter a lot in the model.

00:48:51.910 --> 00:48:55.210 align:middle line:84%
And how you pick
them, well, here, we

00:48:55.210 --> 00:48:59.260 align:middle line:84%
pick them by taking
the data that we have

00:48:59.260 --> 00:49:02.110 align:middle line:84%
and varying the parameters
in the model in such a way

00:49:02.110 --> 00:49:05.020 align:middle line:84%
that we can fit the
model-generated data

00:49:05.020 --> 00:49:06.760 align:middle line:90%
to the actual data.

00:49:06.760 --> 00:49:08.860 align:middle line:84%
Doing that, we have
to make a choice

00:49:08.860 --> 00:49:11.620 align:middle line:84%
of which part of the
actual data to use

00:49:11.620 --> 00:49:14.590 align:middle line:90%
to calibrate which parameter.

00:49:14.590 --> 00:49:16.110 align:middle line:84%
And again, read
the Dawkins thing,

00:49:16.110 --> 00:49:20.210 align:middle line:84%
and you'll see a discussion
of this much more generally.

00:49:20.210 --> 00:49:24.180 align:middle line:84%
OK, so let's look
at what happens.

00:49:24.180 --> 00:49:25.940 align:middle line:90%
How well are we doing?

00:49:25.940 --> 00:49:28.530 align:middle line:84%
Oh, these economists, they
come up with these models.

00:49:28.530 --> 00:49:31.710 align:middle line:84%
God knows how well
they predict, so I'll

00:49:31.710 --> 00:49:33.720 align:middle line:90%
show you how well we're doing.

00:49:33.720 --> 00:49:38.340 align:middle line:84%
This is, at the calibrated
values for Lopburi, I believe--

00:49:38.340 --> 00:49:40.380 align:middle line:90%
doesn't say that on the slide--

00:49:40.380 --> 00:49:44.040 align:middle line:84%
the actual level of output and
the predicted level of output--

00:49:44.040 --> 00:49:45.730 align:middle line:90%
model-predicted.

00:49:45.730 --> 00:49:48.060 align:middle line:84%
So we ran a
successful experiment.

00:49:48.060 --> 00:49:50.400 align:middle line:84%
If you think about the
model as an experiment,

00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:54.420 align:middle line:84%
populated by the
parameters we calibrate,

00:49:54.420 --> 00:49:59.130 align:middle line:84%
then we are able to take this
stylized model, a la Lucas,

00:49:59.130 --> 00:50:02.070 align:middle line:90%
and use it to interpret reality.

00:50:02.070 --> 00:50:05.220 align:middle line:84%
This is pretty close
for consumption,

00:50:05.220 --> 00:50:07.870 align:middle line:84%
the actual being
below the model.

00:50:07.870 --> 00:50:10.380 align:middle line:84%
So in this case, they're
consuming a little bit less

00:50:10.380 --> 00:50:12.420 align:middle line:84%
than what the model
says they might,

00:50:12.420 --> 00:50:15.210 align:middle line:84%
despite our attempt
to fit it to the data.

00:50:15.210 --> 00:50:20.980 align:middle line:84%
And this is for assets,
which is very, very close.

00:50:20.980 --> 00:50:23.220 align:middle line:84%
Now, these last
three figures are all

00:50:23.220 --> 00:50:27.666 align:middle line:84%
aggregated across all the
households in a given economy.

00:50:27.666 --> 00:50:30.006 align:middle line:90%
OK, so having sort of--

00:50:30.006 --> 00:50:32.730 align:middle line:84%
oh, and this is
cash holdings, which

00:50:32.730 --> 00:50:36.030 align:middle line:90%
is one of our weak points.

00:50:36.030 --> 00:50:37.890 align:middle line:84%
And we're pretty
close for a while,

00:50:37.890 --> 00:50:39.750 align:middle line:84%
and then cash
holdings in the data

00:50:39.750 --> 00:50:42.780 align:middle line:84%
still want to be higher
than in the model.

00:50:42.780 --> 00:50:45.480 align:middle line:84%
God knows why they
want that cash.

00:50:45.480 --> 00:50:48.180 align:middle line:90%
We're just still dumbfounded.

00:50:48.180 --> 00:50:51.990 align:middle line:84%
That's the way they're saving
over time, in the aggregate.

00:50:51.990 --> 00:50:54.420 align:middle line:84%
Accumulating claims
on foreigners?

00:50:54.420 --> 00:50:56.850 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that's the paper currency.

00:50:56.850 --> 00:51:00.130 align:middle line:84%
It's a claim on the central
bank, and they love.

00:51:00.130 --> 00:51:01.930 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't bear
interest or anything.

00:51:01.930 --> 00:51:04.510 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, I'll
stop complaining.

00:51:04.510 --> 00:51:09.130 align:middle line:84%
OK, so having done pretty
well with the aggregates,

00:51:09.130 --> 00:51:11.890 align:middle line:84%
one hopes we've earned
the right to talk

00:51:11.890 --> 00:51:14.830 align:middle line:90%
about individual experiences.

00:51:14.830 --> 00:51:18.160 align:middle line:84%
Now, needless to say, there are
many households in a village

00:51:18.160 --> 00:51:21.520 align:middle line:84%
and a non-trivial number of
households in the sample.

00:51:21.520 --> 00:51:25.720 align:middle line:84%
We're fitting the
aggregates via calibration.

00:51:25.720 --> 00:51:27.910 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't expect
perfect performance

00:51:27.910 --> 00:51:29.530 align:middle line:90%
for each and every individual.

00:51:29.530 --> 00:51:31.540 align:middle line:84%
That's too much to hope
for, but let me show you

00:51:31.540 --> 00:51:33.820 align:middle line:84%
how well we did
with household a,

00:51:33.820 --> 00:51:36.370 align:middle line:84%
that labor household
in Lopburi that we

00:51:36.370 --> 00:51:38.120 align:middle line:90%
featured at the beginning.

00:51:38.120 --> 00:51:43.990 align:middle line:84%
So this is the actual
darker line, labor income.

00:51:43.990 --> 00:51:48.760 align:middle line:84%
I showed you this path
before, actually, in wages.

00:51:48.760 --> 00:51:51.640 align:middle line:84%
And they went into
livestock a bit.

00:51:51.640 --> 00:51:55.460 align:middle line:84%
They went into business
and borrowed to do it.

00:51:55.460 --> 00:51:58.510 align:middle line:84%
This is the actual
model prediction,

00:51:58.510 --> 00:52:01.960 align:middle line:84%
which is a lot flatter,
but it's not that far off.

00:52:01.960 --> 00:52:05.290 align:middle line:84%
It matches pretty well at
the beginning and the end.

00:52:05.290 --> 00:52:08.240 align:middle line:84%
This is consumption,
which is horrible.

00:52:08.240 --> 00:52:13.750 align:middle line:84%
So for this household,
the actual numbers drop

00:52:13.750 --> 00:52:17.500 align:middle line:84%
lower than what the model
says it ought to be,

00:52:17.500 --> 00:52:19.730 align:middle line:90%
and fixed assets is closer.

00:52:19.730 --> 00:52:21.650 align:middle line:84%
We do pretty well
with fixed assets,

00:52:21.650 --> 00:52:24.190 align:middle line:84%
including at the individual
household a level.

00:52:24.190 --> 00:52:30.250 align:middle line:84%
And cash, again, under and over,
going up, though, for both.

00:52:30.250 --> 00:52:34.780 align:middle line:84%
OK, so I'm tempted to put
this in the US context,

00:52:34.780 --> 00:52:38.020 align:middle line:84%
because it may make it
seem more real if you

00:52:38.020 --> 00:52:40.090 align:middle line:90%
haven't been in Thai villages.

00:52:40.090 --> 00:52:44.800 align:middle line:84%
What's the effect on farmers
of restricted exports to China,

00:52:44.800 --> 00:52:47.440 align:middle line:90%
when China retaliated?

00:52:47.440 --> 00:52:50.020 align:middle line:84%
They came to an agreement,
but, still, China's

00:52:50.020 --> 00:52:51.940 align:middle line:90%
not purchasing as much.

00:52:51.940 --> 00:52:54.520 align:middle line:84%
The other way around, what
about manufactured goods

00:52:54.520 --> 00:52:55.870 align:middle line:90%
coming in from China?

00:52:55.870 --> 00:52:58.510 align:middle line:84%
What's the effect
on wage-earners

00:52:58.510 --> 00:53:02.710 align:middle line:84%
that produce the thing, which
is now being imported, whereas,

00:53:02.710 --> 00:53:05.590 align:middle line:84%
before, had been
produced domestically?

00:53:05.590 --> 00:53:08.200 align:middle line:84%
But we're going to talk
about those things next time,

00:53:08.200 --> 00:53:10.030 align:middle line:84%
but we can already
answer questions

00:53:10.030 --> 00:53:12.040 align:middle line:90%
like this for Thailand.

00:53:12.040 --> 00:53:17.560 align:middle line:84%
If, for example, we take
the actual estimated model

00:53:17.560 --> 00:53:20.600 align:middle line:90%
and run counterfactuals, OK?

00:53:20.600 --> 00:53:25.760 align:middle line:84%
So suppose we impose trade
frictions within the country.

00:53:25.760 --> 00:53:28.810 align:middle line:84%
What are tariffs going
to do, basically?

00:53:28.810 --> 00:53:30.040 align:middle line:90%
They hurt trade.

00:53:30.040 --> 00:53:32.710 align:middle line:84%
So if a village
had been exporting

00:53:32.710 --> 00:53:36.580 align:middle line:84%
a lot of agricultural goods and
importing a lot of manufactured

00:53:36.580 --> 00:53:41.590 align:middle line:84%
goods, as in the Northeast, then
the effect of a trade friction

00:53:41.590 --> 00:53:44.170 align:middle line:84%
will increase the
price of the thing

00:53:44.170 --> 00:53:47.290 align:middle line:84%
that they have been
buying, the import good,

00:53:47.290 --> 00:53:51.400 align:middle line:84%
and decrease the price
of the export good.

00:53:51.400 --> 00:53:53.360 align:middle line:90%
Hurt both ways.

00:53:53.360 --> 00:53:55.310 align:middle line:90%
We're going to do it by 1%.

00:53:55.310 --> 00:53:58.810 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to take
these calibrated prices that

00:53:58.810 --> 00:54:03.130 align:middle line:84%
were used to match the
payments to factors and profits

00:54:03.130 --> 00:54:06.200 align:middle line:84%
and now vary them
and see what happens.

00:54:06.200 --> 00:54:08.470 align:middle line:84%
We're also going to do
a financial experiment

00:54:08.470 --> 00:54:09.460 align:middle line:90%
in the model.

00:54:09.460 --> 00:54:11.900 align:middle line:84%
We're going to change
the interest rate.

00:54:11.900 --> 00:54:16.150 align:middle line:84%
So it's like we're going
to impede financial flows.

00:54:16.150 --> 00:54:19.030 align:middle line:84%
So again, the effect
of it always hurts.

00:54:19.030 --> 00:54:23.800 align:middle line:84%
So if the village had been
a net lender, for example,

00:54:23.800 --> 00:54:27.160 align:middle line:84%
then the effect of
the financial friction

00:54:27.160 --> 00:54:28.900 align:middle line:84%
is to make the
interest rate lower,

00:54:28.900 --> 00:54:31.240 align:middle line:84%
because lenders don't
like low interest rates.

00:54:31.240 --> 00:54:37.420 align:middle line:84%
We talked about that when we did
the lecture on income and price

00:54:37.420 --> 00:54:41.200 align:middle line:84%
effects for households
in the two-good world.

00:54:41.200 --> 00:54:42.850 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, so if they're
lending, they're

00:54:42.850 --> 00:54:45.880 align:middle line:84%
not going to it that the
interest rate goes down.

00:54:45.880 --> 00:54:49.180 align:middle line:84%
And likewise, if they
had been borrowing,

00:54:49.180 --> 00:54:51.670 align:middle line:84%
we would have gone
the other way and make

00:54:51.670 --> 00:54:53.210 align:middle line:90%
the loans more expensive.

00:54:53.210 --> 00:54:57.940 align:middle line:84%
So that's the effect of the
way we capture in the model,

00:54:57.940 --> 00:55:03.400 align:middle line:84%
in order to run an experiment,
the impact of trade frictions

00:55:03.400 --> 00:55:06.970 align:middle line:84%
through tariffs and/or
internal frictions

00:55:06.970 --> 00:55:09.020 align:middle line:90%
and financial frictions.

00:55:09.020 --> 00:55:12.310 align:middle line:84%
So now you want to
see what happens.

00:55:12.310 --> 00:55:14.650 align:middle line:84%
This is in Lopburi,
and this is the effect

00:55:14.650 --> 00:55:17.590 align:middle line:84%
of that 1% increase
in trade frictions,

00:55:17.590 --> 00:55:20.500 align:middle line:84%
making exports
give less revenue.

00:55:20.500 --> 00:55:23.110 align:middle line:90%
Imports now cost more.

00:55:23.110 --> 00:55:27.820 align:middle line:84%
That's going to affect
the production and profits

00:55:27.820 --> 00:55:31.660 align:middle line:84%
from the manufactured good
and the agricultural good.

00:55:31.660 --> 00:55:35.410 align:middle line:84%
And in turn, remember the
algorithm from last time

00:55:35.410 --> 00:55:37.060 align:middle line:90%
that I reviewed?

00:55:37.060 --> 00:55:39.940 align:middle line:84%
Those price changes
are going to map into--

00:55:39.940 --> 00:55:43.870 align:middle line:84%
input quantities are going to
map into relative factor price

00:55:43.870 --> 00:55:45.220 align:middle line:90%
movements, OK?

00:55:45.220 --> 00:55:49.620 align:middle line:84%
But there's a lot of
diversity in these economies.

00:55:49.620 --> 00:55:52.660 align:middle line:84%
As I've been saying, households
differ by their initial level

00:55:52.660 --> 00:55:53.530 align:middle line:90%
of capital.

00:55:53.530 --> 00:55:56.570 align:middle line:84%
They differ also
by their talent.

00:55:56.570 --> 00:56:01.300 align:middle line:84%
So we have capital moving on
the x-axis and the average skill

00:56:01.300 --> 00:56:04.690 align:middle line:84%
level, pretty high skill level,
and very high skill level.

00:56:04.690 --> 00:56:08.930 align:middle line:84%
And then what's getting plotted
here is the gains or losses.

00:56:08.930 --> 00:56:12.340 align:middle line:90%
So it's a tariff, effectively.

00:56:12.340 --> 00:56:15.190 align:middle line:90%
So you might expect losses.

00:56:15.190 --> 00:56:18.250 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, these average
or low skilled guys

00:56:18.250 --> 00:56:22.480 align:middle line:84%
do suffer losses, arguably
because they're wage earners,

00:56:22.480 --> 00:56:24.250 align:middle line:90%
although you can see that.

00:56:24.250 --> 00:56:29.180 align:middle line:84%
And the movement in
production from the capital

00:56:29.180 --> 00:56:31.480 align:middle line:84%
good and the
labor-intensive good

00:56:31.480 --> 00:56:33.620 align:middle line:90%
was such as to hurt the wage.

00:56:33.620 --> 00:56:35.680 align:middle line:84%
So remember, we did
Stolper-Samuelson,

00:56:35.680 --> 00:56:37.870 align:middle line:84%
where an increase
in the price causes

00:56:37.870 --> 00:56:40.840 align:middle line:84%
an increase in the
factor price of the good

00:56:40.840 --> 00:56:43.220 align:middle line:84%
that is used
relatively intensively.

00:56:43.220 --> 00:56:47.320 align:middle line:84%
So despite all the differences
with the 2x2 from last time,

00:56:47.320 --> 00:56:50.000 align:middle line:84%
that ingredient is
playing a role here.

00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:52.600 align:middle line:84%
So these wage-earners
are hurt, initially.

00:56:52.600 --> 00:56:56.020 align:middle line:84%
But then, ironically, as we
move in the cross section

00:56:56.020 --> 00:56:58.420 align:middle line:84%
for a higher level
of capital, they

00:56:58.420 --> 00:57:01.900 align:middle line:84%
were actually producers,
not wage-earners.

00:57:01.900 --> 00:57:03.970 align:middle line:84%
And now the lower
wage helps them,

00:57:03.970 --> 00:57:07.310 align:middle line:84%
because it's a lowered
cost of production.

00:57:07.310 --> 00:57:08.650 align:middle line:90%
So their profits go up.

00:57:08.650 --> 00:57:12.550 align:middle line:84%
Now they're winning, by
a little less than 1%.

00:57:12.550 --> 00:57:14.500 align:middle line:84%
And if they're really,
really talented,

00:57:14.500 --> 00:57:17.260 align:middle line:84%
they'd been producing at
a higher scale all along,

00:57:17.260 --> 00:57:21.460 align:middle line:84%
so the drop in wages is
even better for them.

00:57:21.460 --> 00:57:24.530 align:middle line:84%
OK, I'm trying to give
you some intuition here,

00:57:24.530 --> 00:57:26.530 align:middle line:84%
but I decided, because
time was short,

00:57:26.530 --> 00:57:30.280 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't be able to actually
prove all these assertions.

00:57:30.280 --> 00:57:34.030 align:middle line:84%
I'm just asking you to
imagine, from the 2x2x2

00:57:34.030 --> 00:57:36.700 align:middle line:84%
that we did last
time, why it is we're

00:57:36.700 --> 00:57:39.460 align:middle line:90%
seeing all this diversity here.

00:57:39.460 --> 00:57:42.220 align:middle line:84%
The order of magnitude
is, like, less than 1%.

00:57:42.220 --> 00:57:43.910 align:middle line:90%
Here, it's 1%.

00:57:43.910 --> 00:57:45.020 align:middle line:90%
So that's pretty small.

00:57:45.020 --> 00:57:50.020 align:middle line:84%
But if you look at the
financial frictions in Lopburi,

00:57:50.020 --> 00:57:53.830 align:middle line:84%
in the sense that I described,
you can see bigger numbers.

00:57:53.830 --> 00:57:56.410 align:middle line:84%
First of all, you see
winners and losers.

00:57:56.410 --> 00:58:00.220 align:middle line:84%
You also see that it matters
whether they were wage-earners

00:58:00.220 --> 00:58:01.750 align:middle line:90%
or capitalists.

00:58:01.750 --> 00:58:07.900 align:middle line:84%
But above all, you see that the
high-skilled guys can benefit

00:58:07.900 --> 00:58:11.620 align:middle line:84%
up to 10% from the increase
in the interest rate

00:58:11.620 --> 00:58:16.330 align:middle line:84%
that's associated with
the financial friction,

00:58:16.330 --> 00:58:20.020 align:middle line:84%
because the village
had been borrowing,

00:58:20.020 --> 00:58:21.550 align:middle line:84%
but some of those
guys don't borrow.

00:58:21.550 --> 00:58:22.660 align:middle line:90%
They lend.

00:58:22.660 --> 00:58:26.740 align:middle line:84%
And likewise, there
are other people here,

00:58:26.740 --> 00:58:29.260 align:middle line:84%
the average-skilled
guys, who are

00:58:29.260 --> 00:58:32.540 align:middle line:90%
taking big losses of up to 10%.

00:58:32.540 --> 00:58:36.650 align:middle line:84%
So again, one could imagine
producing pictures like this.

00:58:36.650 --> 00:58:39.940 align:middle line:84%
And if we go back
to household a, what

00:58:39.940 --> 00:58:43.000 align:middle line:84%
happens to a wage
earner in the US

00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:47.200 align:middle line:84%
with manufactured imports
or a farmer in the Midwest

00:58:47.200 --> 00:58:49.270 align:middle line:90%
with agricultural exports?

00:58:49.270 --> 00:58:54.820 align:middle line:84%
What happens in Lopburi to that
wage-earner under the trade

00:58:54.820 --> 00:58:57.880 align:middle line:84%
friction or under the
financial friction?

00:58:57.880 --> 00:58:59.080 align:middle line:90%
They lose.

00:58:59.080 --> 00:59:00.820 align:middle line:90%
He or she loses.

00:59:00.820 --> 00:59:02.530 align:middle line:90%
That household loses.

00:59:02.530 --> 00:59:05.740 align:middle line:84%
So we validated the model to
try to make this realistic.

00:59:05.740 --> 00:59:07.450 align:middle line:90%
It fit pretty well--

00:59:07.450 --> 00:59:08.230 align:middle line:90%
very well.

00:59:08.230 --> 00:59:10.030 align:middle line:84%
At the aggregate level,
it fit pretty well.

00:59:10.030 --> 00:59:11.390 align:middle line:90%
At the individual level--

00:59:11.390 --> 00:59:13.570 align:middle line:84%
so if for some reason
the Thai government

00:59:13.570 --> 00:59:17.470 align:middle line:84%
had run this experiment or
they had political issues that

00:59:17.470 --> 00:59:19.960 align:middle line:84%
made the country
more isolated, you

00:59:19.960 --> 00:59:24.040 align:middle line:84%
could see the effect of that
on individual households

00:59:24.040 --> 00:59:26.230 align:middle line:90%
through the lens of the model.

00:59:26.230 --> 00:59:30.620 align:middle line:90%
OK, any final questions?

00:59:30.620 --> 00:59:32.720 align:middle line:84%
So again, we'll kind
of do it all over again

00:59:32.720 --> 00:59:36.510 align:middle line:84%
when we come to the US
next time, next Thursday.

00:59:36.510 --> 00:59:42.120 align:middle line:90%

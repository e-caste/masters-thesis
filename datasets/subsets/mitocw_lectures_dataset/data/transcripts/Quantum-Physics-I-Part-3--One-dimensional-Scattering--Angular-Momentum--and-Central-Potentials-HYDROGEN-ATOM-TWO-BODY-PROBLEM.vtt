BARTON ZWIEBACH:
Hydrogen atom is

00:00:02.378 --> 00:00:05.420
the beginning of our analysis.

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:07.950
It still won't solve
differential equations,

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:15.170
but we will now two particles,
a proton, whose coordinates are

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:20.700
going to be coordinate
of the proton,

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:25.820
subbing Xp for the proton,
and momentum of the proton.

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.540
And there's an electron.

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.210
And there's the coordinates,
the three coordinates

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.850
of the electron, and
the three components

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.440
of the momenta of the electron.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.230
And these are your
canonical variables.

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.850
This means that the
components of this object

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.020
satisfy the standard
commutation relations.

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.386
That is-- I have to write
it like the following.

00:00:59.386 --> 00:01:03.510
They considered the
coordinates of the proton,

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.345
the i-th component.

00:01:07.345 --> 00:01:13.290
And the momentum of the proton,
the j-th component, that's

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.240
equal to ih bar delta ij.

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.006
You see, we used to code for
its x, y, and z, and momenta

00:01:23.006 --> 00:01:24.910
Px, Py, Pz.

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:30.530
You could've called it X1,
X2, X3, momenta P1, P2, P3.

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:36.660
And in that way, you can use
a parameter delta over here.

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:39.895
So, these are the
commutation relations

00:01:39.895 --> 00:01:45.360
of X's and P's, but
X and P for a proton.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.080
So, the proton has
its X, has its P,

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.380
and it behaves like an X
and P that we've studied.

00:01:52.380 --> 00:02:00.450
The electron has its X, its P,
and also behaves the same way

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:11.400
as coordinates P of electron
j equal ih bar delta ij.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.750
You see, this is
because x operator, y

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.870
operator, z operator--
you can call them

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.280
xi operators with 1, 2, 3.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:30.630
The Px, Py, Pz operators
are better called P sub i,

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:37.280
with i running from 1, 2,
and 3, and x being the first,

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.560
y the second, z being the last.

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.410
Then the fact that the x
just fails to commute with Px

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.966
and y fails to commute with
Py, and z fails to commute

00:02:47.966 --> 00:02:56.800
with Pz is xi pj
equal ih bar delta ij.

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.640
And this is what I'm saying
here with this notation

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.830
because there are
too many subscripts.

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.390
There's a P for
proton, but there's

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.600
an i for the first, second
and third component.

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.800
And there's the
momentum of proton,

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.380
which has 1, 2, 3 components.

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:19.520
So, those are our
dynamical variables.

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:23.720
And then when you
try to solve this,

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.980
you have the issue
of wave functions.

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:29.850
What happens to
the wave functions?

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:34.560
Should I invent a wave function
for the electron and a wave

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.505
function for the proton?

00:03:37.505 --> 00:03:38.680
No.

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.250
That's not good.

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:44.910
You shouldn't a wave
function for everybody,

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:50.690
which is a wave function that
depends on the coordinates

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:52.920
X of the electron.

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.390
And if you had just
an electron, you

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:58.300
would have a wave function that
depends on X of the electron

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:01.450
and a wave function that
depends on the coordinates

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.174
of the proton.

00:04:04.174 --> 00:04:07.970
And how would you normalize it?

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:14.790
Well, this thing times
d cubed Xe times d

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:21.810
cubed Xp is the
probability, dP to find

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:27.590
the electron around the little
cube about the point, Xe,

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:33.790
and the proton around the
little cube around Xp.

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:36.200
And then if you
want to see what is

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.620
it probability to find
the electron at some point

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:43.340
regardless of the proton,
you integrate over

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.220
the whole proton.

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:49.040
And then you should just
have a wave function.

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:53.864
So, if you integrate this
psi squared-- oh, I'm sorry,

00:04:53.864 --> 00:04:54.818
psi is squared.

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:02.270
If you this psi squared
over the proton,

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:04.670
you're left with
some probability

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:06.800
density for the electron.

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:12.620
So, this is the good thing about
having more and more particles.

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:17.060
You still have just one wave
function and one Schrodinger

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:18.980
equation.

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:22.830
You have more particles, and
it's just one wave function.

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:24.830
That's why people eventually
talk about the wave

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:27.260
function of the universe.

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.800
I say, well, the whole
universe has one wave function

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:36.760
for every, for every molecule,
for every elementary particle.

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:39.500
There's just one wave function.

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:42.112
That's nice about the
Schrodinger equation.

00:05:42.112 --> 00:05:47.440
And, OK, so we have this,
and what is the Hamiltonian?

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:53.880
The Hamiltonian is
the kinetic energy

00:05:53.880 --> 00:06:03.980
associated to the proton plus
the kinetic energy associated

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:12.170
to the electron plus the
potential energy, which

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:15.396
just the depends on the
distance between the electron

00:06:15.396 --> 00:06:16.260
and the proton.

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:24.650
And then and write the
differential equation,

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:27.750
the Schrodinger equation.

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:36.440
And the P of the proton would
be thought as ddx of the proton.

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:43.870
And the P of the electron would
be like ddx of the electron.

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:47.690
And that differential
equation would make sense.

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:55.660
So what is our problem
showing that we have--

00:06:55.660 --> 00:07:01.560
can think in some way as a
potential or a Schrodinger

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:05.690
equation that the most--
just some distance that

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:12.140
separates the particles, and
some equation for the rest.

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:17.780
So, we have to change variables.

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:20.936
So what is the
change of variables?

00:07:20.936 --> 00:07:27.230
I'm going to motivate
some of that.

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:32.870
Well, we have two pairs
of canonical variables.

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:37.610
We have the proton canonical
variables, X and P,

00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:41.860
of the proton, and the electron
canonical variables, X and P,

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:43.130
of the electron.

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:48.140
So how can we have
different kind

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:54.020
of variables that will lead
to a more interesting thing?

00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:58.130
We can imagine that maybe we
should define a new X that

00:07:58.130 --> 00:08:03.800
is the difference for which
the magnitude of that X

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:07.790
will be what we call r.

00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:10.510
And that's true, but it's
not so easy to do that

00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:15.260
from the beginning, so let's
try to do what most people would

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:18.450
do from experience
and say, I know

00:08:18.450 --> 00:08:22.160
there's something simple about
a system of doing the wrapping

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:25.960
values, center of mass.

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:29.540
If the center of mass moves
with constant velocity,

00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:31.050
that's what it does always.

00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:37.850
So, if classical notions of
how you treat two-body systems

00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:39.860
can be used in a
quantum setting,

00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:44.150
we should be able to
define a new quantum

00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:47.480
coordinate associated
to the center of mass,

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:49.800
and a new quantum
momentum associated

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:51.818
to the center of mass.

00:08:51.818 --> 00:08:56.360
And the center of mass
momentum is always

00:08:56.360 --> 00:09:02.700
the sum of the momenta, so we
will define at P, a capital P--

00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:09.340
I hope that my P's are
going to be always clear.

00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:15.411
They're not supposed to have
before this one, the little bar

00:09:15.411 --> 00:09:15.910
below.

00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:18.870
This is the total,
P, and it's going

00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:23.390
to be defined as the momentum
of the proton plus the momentum

00:09:23.390 --> 00:09:26.550
of the electrons.

00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:34.360
And now, I want to define
an X that goes with this P.

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:39.480
And by that, I mean that this
X must have a commutation

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:44.350
relation with this P
that tells, yes, you

00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:49.270
are an X because X with
P should be ih bar.

00:09:49.270 --> 00:09:52.870
So, whatever I define
here, that should happen.

00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:55.630
Now, you could imagine
that we usually

00:09:55.630 --> 00:09:57.580
do something like this--

00:09:57.580 --> 00:10:01.105
we multiply each particle
according to its mass.

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:06.540
Pe.

00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:16.692
So we're weighting the
momenta associated to--

00:10:16.692 --> 00:10:19.340
oh, I'm sorry.

00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:30.510
The positions, Xp, Xe,
associated to the mass.

00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:35.020
And this, of course, would
not have the right units.

00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:37.270
It doesn't have
units of coordinate,

00:10:37.270 --> 00:10:39.870
so this is the center of mass.

00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:46.151
So, this will be center
of mass quantum variables.

00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:52.480
And in order to have units,
you must divide by a mass,

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:57.650
so it's not too unreasonable
to put the sum of masses here.

00:10:57.650 --> 00:11:03.302
That's how you define it
anyway in classical mechanics.

00:11:03.302 --> 00:11:15.246
And now, we must ask is X
with P the i-th component

00:11:15.246 --> 00:11:17.640
of the j-th component.

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:22.640
Is it really equal
to ih bar delta ij?

00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:33.640
And the answer, I
would say, is yes

00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:37.096
because, here,
let's do this one.

00:11:37.096 --> 00:11:52.740
You will have mp Xpi plus
me Xei over mp plus m e.

00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:55.320
You see, once you
do one, all the rest

00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:59.210
you should be able to do
just without thinking.

00:11:59.210 --> 00:12:05.430
P, on the other hand, is
P of the momentums of j

00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:11.350
plus the momentum of
the electron, so j.

00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:13.300
What is it equal to?

00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:21.167
And then you say, look,
from Xp with momentums of P,

00:12:21.167 --> 00:12:28.720
yes, they give me ih bar delta
ij, but there will be ih bar.

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:36.351
The first factor there will be
an extra mp over mp plus m e.

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:44.420
So this contribution comes from
the first term that only talks

00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:47.210
to the momentum of the proton.

00:12:47.210 --> 00:12:50.436
Doesn't talk to the
momentum of the electron.

00:12:50.436 --> 00:12:53.780
And the second term for the
coordinate of the electron

00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:56.433
only talks to the
momentum of the electron.

00:12:56.433 --> 00:13:03.530
And it does give you
an ih bar delta ij,

00:13:03.530 --> 00:13:10.230
but this time will be with
an m e over mp plus m e.

00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:12.620
And this factor is equal to 1.

00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:15.430
So, yes, we can box this.

00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:21.410
This is a pair of quantum
mechanical canonical variables.

00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:23.650
They have the right commutation.

00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:25.650
They have the right units,
the right commutator,

00:13:25.650 --> 00:13:27.133
the right everything.

00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:34.270
So next time when you
see this, you will say,

00:13:34.270 --> 00:13:39.520
X with P-- you say,
Xp with P is 1.

00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:41.540
Xe with P is 1.

00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:43.800
mp plus-- 1.

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:44.940
Yes, it works.

00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:47.642
You forget ih bar delta ij.

00:13:47.642 --> 00:13:53.490
This is more clear
that it will work.

00:13:53.490 --> 00:13:55.080
Try it.

00:13:55.080 --> 00:14:02.940
Next, we need the second pair
of canonical variables, so--

00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:05.315
well, actually I should
use this one for this.

00:14:08.165 --> 00:14:13.950
So for the second pair,
it's reasonable to use the X

00:14:13.950 --> 00:14:23.940
that we anticipated, so we'll
have a relative coordinate, X.

00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:26.270
And I don't know how I call it--

00:14:26.270 --> 00:14:30.165
X relative, or--
no, just little x.

00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:39.405
Little x will be defined
as X of the electron.

00:14:39.405 --> 00:14:40.530
I think that's coordinates.

00:14:40.530 --> 00:14:45.440
X of the electron
minus X of the proton.

00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:46.750
This is natural.

00:14:46.750 --> 00:14:50.030
We want a little x like that.

00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:54.980
Already at this point, you
could be paralyzed with fear.

00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:58.940
Something could have gone
wrong at this moment.

00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:06.900
Imagine if this x doesn't
commute with these guys.

00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:10.900
Then it's all a
disaster because this

00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:16.180
should be electron and proton
commute with each other.

00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:18.170
I should have written
there, not only

00:15:18.170 --> 00:15:21.350
those are the
commutation relations,

00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:23.160
everything else is 0.

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:27.770
Any X of electron with a
momentum of a proton is 0.

00:15:27.770 --> 00:15:29.945
That's why they're
two independent pairs

00:15:29.945 --> 00:15:33.220
of canonical variables
that we can treat.

00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:37.100
It better be that this
is an independent pair

00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:41.330
of canonical
variables, so it better

00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:46.950
be that this x and whatever
P I'm going to define here

00:15:46.950 --> 00:15:51.109
commute with these guys.

00:15:51.109 --> 00:15:56.800
And as far as this x,
happily it works out

00:15:56.800 --> 00:16:00.850
because X's commute
with any X's here,

00:16:00.850 --> 00:16:05.530
so this little x definitely
commutes with the little x.

00:16:05.530 --> 00:16:09.320
But the fact that this commutes
with P could have killed it,

00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:12.680
but it doesn't because
of the minus sign.

00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:16.840
One of the commutators of the
little x with the capital P

00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:21.880
would give for the electron
an ih bar, and for the proton,

00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:23.664
a minus ih bar.

00:16:23.664 --> 00:16:25.600
And they cancel.

00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:29.100
So, all is good so far.

00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:41.401
So, this is so far so good--
commutes with capital X

00:16:41.401 --> 00:16:46.840
and capital P. So now,
we have here something,

00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:54.050
and we could put that
number, alpha Pe minus beta

00:16:54.050 --> 00:16:56.420
P of the proton.

00:16:59.610 --> 00:17:03.128
And we all know what
alpha and beta are.

00:17:03.128 --> 00:17:07.690
But now you can more
or less be confident.

00:17:07.690 --> 00:17:16.390
I need that this momentum
with this x give me 1, ih bar.

00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:21.010
So, that would put the
condition on alpha and beta.

00:17:21.010 --> 00:17:32.173
In fact, the condition
that xi with P bar j

00:17:32.173 --> 00:17:40.410
give you ih bar delta ij,
you can imagine what it is.

00:17:40.410 --> 00:17:46.470
It's that alpha plus
beta is equal to 1.

00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:58.930
And the condition
that this momentum

00:17:58.930 --> 00:18:04.140
commute with the center
of mass position, which

00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:06.195
it can fail to do so--

00:18:15.690 --> 00:18:17.200
what can it give?

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:23.930
Well, W alpha of the P of
the electron goes with m e,

00:18:23.930 --> 00:18:34.505
so it's something like alpha m
e minus beta mp is equal to 0.

00:18:37.070 --> 00:18:43.080
And please-- oh, this
commutator should be 0.

00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:46.133
Please make sure you
know how to do this.

00:18:46.133 --> 00:18:48.060
You can get those conditions.

00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:52.140
I'm going maybe a little fast
for you to just follow it up.

00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:59.570
And so, at this moment, we
can solve for alpha and beta--

00:18:59.570 --> 00:19:00.520
two equations.

00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:07.992
So alpha is equal to
mp over me plus mp.

00:19:07.992 --> 00:19:14.945
And beta is equal to
m e over m e plus mp.

00:19:22.865 --> 00:19:26.520
And we have a pair of
canonical variables

00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:31.065
as well here, therefore,
the relative coordinate

00:19:31.065 --> 00:19:35.220
and the relative
momentum, in some sense.

00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:38.220
It's useful to
define two symbols.

00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:46.294
So, we use mass m e
mp over mp plus mp.

00:19:46.294 --> 00:19:53.400
And the total mass,
which is m e plus mp.

00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:59.540
In the case of a heavy proton,
the reduced mass-- the proton

00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:01.343
is heavy compared
with the electron.

00:20:01.343 --> 00:20:05.045
You can ignore the electron
here, cancel them, e.

00:20:05.045 --> 00:20:10.050
And the reduced
mass is called this.

00:20:10.050 --> 00:20:12.570
So, in terms of
the reduced mass,

00:20:12.570 --> 00:20:22.140
alpha is equal to mu over m
e, and beta is mu over mp.

00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:24.030
Those are unit-free constants.

00:20:24.030 --> 00:20:28.184
So summarizing, the second
pair of canonical variables

00:20:28.184 --> 00:20:31.480
are Xe minus--

00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:33.470
Xe minus Xp.

00:20:36.090 --> 00:20:48.090
And P equals mu Pe over m
e minus P sub p over mp.

00:20:55.080 --> 00:21:03.280
All right, so--
so, the last step

00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:06.600
that we're going to follow,
and after that, we'll

00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:08.765
get the Hamiltonian
and stop there.

00:21:08.765 --> 00:21:13.446
And we'll discuss
solutions next time.

00:21:13.446 --> 00:21:19.530
But finally, we have
enough equations

00:21:19.530 --> 00:21:27.980
to solve for the momenta
we have in the Hamiltonian

00:21:27.980 --> 00:21:32.290
in terms of the
center of mass momenta

00:21:32.290 --> 00:21:35.220
and the relative momenta.

00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:42.590
So, from equation
star and double star

00:21:42.590 --> 00:21:49.290
here, you can solve
for these momenta.

00:21:49.290 --> 00:21:59.320
So, P of the proton will be
equal to mp over M, big momenta

00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:01.356
minus little momenta.

00:22:01.356 --> 00:22:10.028
And P of the electron is m e
over capital M, big momenta

00:22:10.028 --> 00:22:11.492
plus little momenta.

00:22:18.330 --> 00:22:24.440
Well, one more equation
that we have to write,

00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:26.810
and that's the key
to the simplicity

00:22:26.810 --> 00:22:28.702
of all what we've done.

00:22:28.702 --> 00:22:32.930
At this moment, we have a
very good physical insight

00:22:32.930 --> 00:22:35.180
into what we've
done, but we want

00:22:35.180 --> 00:22:38.210
to see if the math collaborates.

00:22:38.210 --> 00:22:40.400
And the good
physical insight has

00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:42.740
been that center of
mass motion should

00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:46.250
be independent of
the relative motion,

00:22:46.250 --> 00:22:50.180
and of we have the right X.

00:22:50.180 --> 00:22:52.790
So, the thing that
we have to compute

00:22:52.790 --> 00:22:57.530
is the first two terms
in the Hamiltonian,

00:22:57.530 --> 00:23:03.470
P of the proton squared
over 2m of the proton

00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:10.970
plus p of the electron squared
over 2 mass of the electron.

00:23:10.970 --> 00:23:15.600
So, I have 1 over
2m of the proton,

00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:26.250
and I have m of the proton over
capital M, P minus little p,

00:23:26.250 --> 00:23:31.024
and plus 1 over 2m
of the electron--

00:23:31.024 --> 00:23:33.900
this is squared--
m of the electron

00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:39.350
over capital M, big
P plus little p.

00:23:39.350 --> 00:23:44.150
And the plus and minus
are extremely reassuring

00:23:44.150 --> 00:23:49.370
because the cross terms
that couple the two

00:23:49.370 --> 00:23:51.040
are going to vanish.

00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:54.553
You can see cross terms will
have a minus sign. mp will

00:23:54.553 --> 00:23:55.618
be canceled.

00:23:55.618 --> 00:23:56.900
m e will cancel.

00:23:56.900 --> 00:23:58.780
They will cancel.

00:23:58.780 --> 00:24:02.902
So at the end of this
little calculation that

00:24:02.902 --> 00:24:12.980
takes couple of lines, you get
1 over 2 capital M total center

00:24:12.980 --> 00:24:25.990
of mass of this squared plus
1 over 2 mu little momentum

00:24:25.990 --> 00:24:26.660
squared.

00:24:26.660 --> 00:24:30.850
This is a kinetic operator.

00:24:30.850 --> 00:24:36.330
And then you say, great
success, the kinetic energy

00:24:36.330 --> 00:24:41.275
now has separated into a
center of mass contribution

00:24:41.275 --> 00:24:43.100
and a relative contribution.

00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:47.540
This will allow us to
now with a little step,

00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:52.060
separate the total Schrodinger
equation into center

00:24:52.060 --> 00:24:54.410
of mass motion and
relative motion,

00:24:54.410 --> 00:24:58.480
and the relative motion will
have [INAUDIBLE] potential.

00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:02.390
So we'll do the
punchline next time.

00:00:09.965 --> 00:00:11.090 align:middle line:90%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: All right.

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:15.680 align:middle line:84%
So let's take a look
at where we are.

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.270 align:middle line:84%
On the calendar, we're
at lecture 17 today.

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:24.370 align:middle line:84%
As I said last time,
lectures 16, 17, 18 and 19

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:27.460 align:middle line:84%
are all about
Walrasian equilibria

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.210 align:middle line:90%
and their properties.

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.310 align:middle line:84%
So we did the welfare theorems,
which we can review again

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:36.790 align:middle line:84%
momentarily today
about existence

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:38.170 align:middle line:90%
of all raising equilibria.

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:42.250 align:middle line:84%
And while we're at it, how we
could interpret the Walrasian

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.850 align:middle line:84%
equilibrium as the outcome
of the game using a Nash

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:47.860 align:middle line:90%
equilibrium notion.

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:52.630 align:middle line:84%
And then, we get to these two
juxtaposed lectures, 18 and 19.

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:55.510 align:middle line:84%
Gorman aggregation
has to do with when

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.330 align:middle line:84%
it looks as if there
were far fewer households

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:01.360 align:middle line:84%
than there actually are, because
we're able to add them up.

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.880 align:middle line:84%
That takes some pretty
strong assumptions

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:07.810 align:middle line:84%
that we've already gone through
in terms of linear income

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:09.040 align:middle line:90%
expansion paths.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.240 align:middle line:90%
So we'll review that.

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.060 align:middle line:84%
And then, identification
is, if you go the other way

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.930 align:middle line:84%
and assume almost nothing
other than rationality,

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:19.580 align:middle line:84%
are you capable of
rejecting the model?

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.490 align:middle line:84%
And then, the last
two lectures are

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.770 align:middle line:84%
about failures of
the welfare theorems

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.070 align:middle line:84%
and relatedly,
monetary economics.

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:29.520 align:middle line:90%
We're moving right along.

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.010 align:middle line:84%
In terms of what you
should be reading,

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:33.600 align:middle line:84%
ideally, I don't
if you guys ever

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.190 align:middle line:90%
do read these start articles.

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:39.160 align:middle line:84%
But let me just point
out that you should be.

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:43.590 align:middle line:84%
And in particular,
today, lecture 17 today--

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.520 align:middle line:84%
so on the course
posting under Canvas,

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.290 align:middle line:84%
there'll be the Kreps section
6.4 on existence and number

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.250 align:middle line:90%
of equilibria.

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.700 align:middle line:84%
Some of the diagrams from
today come from that chapter.

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.850 align:middle line:84%
Although obviously, there's
more in there in the book

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.230 align:middle line:90%
than there is in the lecture.

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:05.430 align:middle line:90%
And also, this course material--

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.120 align:middle line:84%
Asu's stuff from a
different MIT course.

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:12.720 align:middle line:84%
She's got a really great
lecture on existence

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.740 align:middle line:90%
of Nash equilibrium.

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.720 align:middle line:90%
And I borrowed that quite a bit.

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.990 align:middle line:84%
The entire lecture is
posted on our website,

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:22.270 align:middle line:84%
but we will cover a big
chunk of it today in class.

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.080 align:middle line:84%
So those are the two
starred readings.

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.350 align:middle line:84%
And then, we get to
a bit of a review.

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:34.260 align:middle line:84%
So this is a bit challenging,
but I'll ask it anyway.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.830 align:middle line:84%
It really has to do with stating
the first welfare theorem,

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:44.070 align:middle line:84%
and then outlining for us the
steps necessary to prove it.

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:48.330 align:middle line:84%
So Daniel, you want to take a
crack at that by any chance?

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:52.210 align:middle line:90%


00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:54.610 align:middle line:84%
You remember the steps for
proving the first welfare

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.520 align:middle line:90%
theorem?

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:00.610 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: If I recall correctly,
the first welfare theorem

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:12.830 align:middle line:84%
was that under the assumption
of everybody being rational

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:16.517 align:middle line:90%
and [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:16.517 --> 00:03:17.850 align:middle line:90%
I think that might have been it.

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:20.680 align:middle line:90%
There is a lambda-weighted--

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.980 align:middle line:84%
then, the economy will
create a lambda-weighted--

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:27.660 align:middle line:84%
it will maximize the
lambda-weighted sum

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.680 align:middle line:90%
of the utilities of the people.

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.890 align:middle line:84%
And the proof-- yeah, I
don't think I remember

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.200 align:middle line:90%
the steps of the proof.

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.100 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Can I
take a shot at it?

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:40.133 align:middle line:90%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Sure.

00:03:40.133 --> 00:03:41.550 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: If I
remember correctly,

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:44.730 align:middle line:84%
the proof goes something
like, for each person,

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:46.620 align:middle line:84%
because of the
budget constraint,

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.790 align:middle line:84%
any outcome that would
be strictly preferred

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.700 align:middle line:84%
by that person would
require a larger budget.

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:58.560 align:middle line:84%
And so in order for
something to be or not to--

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.830 align:middle line:84%
for the allocation,
whatever everyone ends up

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:04.170 align:middle line:84%
getting not to be
free to optimal,

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:06.930 align:middle line:84%
it would require
everyone getting--

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:09.990 align:middle line:90%
it would require at least--

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:12.240 align:middle line:84%
it would require all the
budgets to either be the same

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.990 align:middle line:90%
or increased.

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:17.220 align:middle line:84%
But you can't-- and if you
also factor in the price,

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:21.480 align:middle line:84%
the profit maximization part,
you can do the same thing

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:22.590 align:middle line:90%
on the production side.

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:25.890 align:middle line:84%
And you basically end up getting
an impossible situation, where

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:28.020 align:middle line:84%
you have to have
more stuff being

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.290 align:middle line:84%
consumed than being produced
because of market [INAUDIBLE]..

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:34.420 align:middle line:84%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yep,
that's very good.

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:37.970 align:middle line:84%
That was a very,
very good outline.

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:40.750 align:middle line:84%
So the first welfare theorem
says that any Walrasian

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:43.270 align:middle line:90%
equilibrium is optimal.

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:48.740 align:middle line:84%
And the proof is
by contradiction.

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.680 align:middle line:90%
Suppose it's not optimal.

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:53.200 align:middle line:84%
Then, there's
something that's weakly

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:57.880 align:middle line:84%
preferred by some households and
strictly preferred by others.

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:03.580 align:middle line:84%
And then, as was just said, the
strictly preferred by others

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:09.250 align:middle line:84%
means it could not have been
available, because it otherwise

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:12.130 align:middle line:84%
would have been purchased
in Walrasian equilibria.

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:15.790 align:middle line:84%
And then, we had a little lemma
that was quite subtle even

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:20.360 align:middle line:84%
for those guys who weekly prefer
the alternative allocation,

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:25.650 align:middle line:84%
they too would be
spending weekly more.

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:29.540 align:middle line:84%
And so we get the
total expenditure

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:32.370 align:middle line:84%
summing up over
all the households

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:36.450 align:middle line:84%
that would be necessary
at the competitive prices

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:39.540 align:middle line:84%
to achieve the alternative
allocation to be strictly

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:43.590 align:middle line:84%
greater than what is being spent
in the competitive allocation.

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:49.020 align:middle line:84%
Then, we add that to
profit maximization.

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:56.840 align:middle line:84%
And we get a relationship, a
strict inequality relationship,

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:00.350 align:middle line:84%
which at the end of the day
said that the allocation

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:03.170 align:middle line:90%
in the alternative--

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:07.010 align:middle line:84%
allocation that's supposed
to be Pareto dominating

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:10.630 align:middle line:90%
is not resource-feasible.

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:13.100 align:middle line:84%
But the definition
of Pareto optimality

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:20.310 align:middle line:84%
is that there is a dominating--
if something's not optimal,

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:23.410 align:middle line:84%
it can be dominated by
something that is feasible.

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:26.700 align:middle line:84%
So the feasibility part
will be contradicted,

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:29.490 align:middle line:90%
and that was the proof.

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:31.730 align:middle line:84%
OK, so you'll see
this theorem again

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:36.890 align:middle line:84%
when we get to that last
lecture on monetary economics.

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:43.060 align:middle line:84%
It's going to turn out that
under certain conditions

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:48.380 align:middle line:84%
like having overlapping
generations of people

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:55.710 align:middle line:84%
so that no person lives forever,
but time goes on forever,

00:06:55.710 --> 00:07:00.300 align:middle line:84%
that that's enough to
make the first welfare

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:04.860 align:middle line:84%
theorem fail, surprisingly, when
we get into monetary economics.

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:10.110 align:middle line:84%
And the proof then
begs the issue

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:12.990 align:middle line:84%
of where this proof
is breaking down.

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:16.770 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to turn
out that the valuation

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:21.030 align:middle line:84%
of the alternative bundle at the
competitive equilibrium prices

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:23.880 align:middle line:90%
costs an infinite amount.

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:26.100 align:middle line:84%
So we implicitly
assume everything

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:29.970 align:middle line:84%
is finite in this finite
dimension of Euclidean space.

00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:33.390 align:middle line:90%
Anyway, just to anticipate.

00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:39.390 align:middle line:84%
Second thing I want to
ask about is similar.

00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:44.880 align:middle line:84%
Outline the steps of the proof
of the second welfare theorem

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:47.870 align:middle line:90%
that we did in class last time.

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:50.180 align:middle line:84%
So I don't expect a
lot of detail on this,

00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:56.090 align:middle line:90%
but let's see who would like to.

00:07:56.090 --> 00:08:00.150 align:middle line:84%
Yuen, can you
volunteer for that?

00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:01.640 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Sure, yeah.

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:03.500 align:middle line:84%
So the second welfare
theorem states

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:07.340 align:middle line:84%
that any Pareto
optimal allocation

00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:11.120 align:middle line:84%
can be achieved by
some price equilibrium,

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:15.800 align:middle line:84%
assuming that you can shift
endowment point under exchange.

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:20.780 align:middle line:84%
And so in the Lagrangian
maximization problem,

00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:23.030 align:middle line:84%
basically, you're finding
the actual endowment

00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:27.200 align:middle line:84%
that will give you the
correct price equilibrium

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:31.500 align:middle line:84%
corresponding to the desired
Pareto optimal allocation.

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:33.020 align:middle line:84%
And you can do
that just by first

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:39.230 align:middle line:84%
solving the Pareto problem to
get the first order conditions

00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:40.070 align:middle line:90%
reallocations.

00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:43.169 align:middle line:84%
And then, you can solve the
Walrasian equilibrium problem--

00:08:43.169 --> 00:08:46.850 align:middle line:84%
so the consumer and the firm
side problem separately.

00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:49.400 align:middle line:84%
And then, you just match the
first order of conditions.

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:51.650 align:middle line:84%
So the appropriate parameters,
like the shadow prices,

00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:55.640 align:middle line:84%
need to equal the prices
in the price equilibrium--

00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:57.600 align:middle line:90%
stuff like that.

00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:01.040 align:middle line:84%
And you can show that all these
things exist in our system.

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:03.380 align:middle line:90%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Perfect, yep.

00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:06.870 align:middle line:84%
The key is the
Lagrangian method,

00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:12.830 align:middle line:84%
which under convexity in sets
and concavity in functions

00:09:12.830 --> 00:09:16.110 align:middle line:84%
makes the first order conditions
necessary and sufficient.

00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:19.220 align:middle line:84%
So to find a solution,
all you need to do

00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:24.060 align:middle line:84%
is find variables and
shadow prices that satisfy

00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:25.380 align:middle line:90%
those first order conditions.

00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:29.970 align:middle line:84%
We have the obvious candidate,
because we start with a Pareto

00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:32.190 align:middle line:90%
optimal allocation.

00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:36.000 align:middle line:84%
So we just compare what we need
for the Walrasian allocation

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.830 align:middle line:84%
to what we already have
from the Pareto problem--

00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:44.970 align:middle line:84%
allocation, and choose
prices, and Lagrange

00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:47.370 align:middle line:84%
multipliers, and
so on accordingly.

00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:50.050 align:middle line:90%
So your answer was perfect.

00:09:50.050 --> 00:09:52.200 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:52.700 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:57.080 align:middle line:84%
So that's so many
review questions,

00:09:57.080 --> 00:10:02.540 align:middle line:84%
because we really focused pretty
narrowly on those two theorems

00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:03.170 align:middle line:90%
in class.

00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:05.320 align:middle line:90%
So all right.

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:10.450 align:middle line:84%
So then, the lecture
today is existence.

00:10:10.450 --> 00:10:11.980 align:middle line:90%
Sounds ominous.

00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:16.820 align:middle line:84%
[CHUCKLES] What does
it mean to not exist?

00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:19.690 align:middle line:84%
Well, as per the
welfare theorems,

00:10:19.690 --> 00:10:22.480 align:middle line:84%
I said with the first
welfare theorem,

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:24.430 align:middle line:84%
if a competitive
equilibrium exists

00:10:24.430 --> 00:10:28.970 align:middle line:84%
and it's optimal, how do we know
it exists in the first place?

00:10:28.970 --> 00:10:30.190 align:middle line:90%
That's one way to put it.

00:10:30.190 --> 00:10:33.310 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, it's possible
that many things we do

00:10:33.310 --> 00:10:35.920 align:middle line:84%
are vacuous, because
we assume a concept

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:38.950 align:middle line:84%
and assume an allocation
that satisfies the concept.

00:10:38.950 --> 00:10:40.900 align:middle line:84%
But we'd better
go back and check.

00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:42.730 align:middle line:84%
Along the way, there's
more interesting

00:10:42.730 --> 00:10:44.950 align:middle line:84%
stuff happening in
this lecture, which

00:10:44.950 --> 00:10:48.430 align:middle line:84%
has to do with reviewing the
definition of a Walrasian

00:10:48.430 --> 00:10:51.760 align:middle line:84%
equilibria and then seeing
how sufficient assumptions

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:54.760 align:middle line:84%
for existence, but
also in principle,

00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:57.040 align:middle line:84%
how you might want
to compute it,

00:10:57.040 --> 00:11:03.320 align:middle line:84%
which brings us to modern day
platforms and online markets.

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:04.960 align:middle line:90%
So it's not just abstract.

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:07.780 align:middle line:84%
It's actually something
computer scientists

00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:09.880 align:middle line:84%
and fintechs worry
about quite a bit.

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:13.660 align:middle line:84%
And relatedly, we'll compare
the Walrasian equilibria

00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:17.440 align:middle line:84%
to the Nash equilibria,
which is a different concept

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:18.280 align:middle line:90%
of an equilibrium.

00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:21.500 align:middle line:84%
But it takes the same
sufficient conditions.

00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:26.890 align:middle line:84%
And again, that's a very,
very useful tool to master.

00:11:26.890 --> 00:11:28.160 align:middle line:90%
But we want to go beyond that.

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:29.090 align:middle line:90%
We want to use it.

00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:31.690 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to show you
some pictures of what's

00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:35.320 align:middle line:84%
going on in the New York
financial markets and date,

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:39.250 align:middle line:84%
at least verbally, trade fails,
and when those markets get

00:11:39.250 --> 00:11:42.550 align:middle line:84%
messed up, as in the
Coronavirus in March.

00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:44.470 align:middle line:84%
And then, we'll think
about, are there

00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:48.310 align:middle line:84%
ways to clean up the markets
and avoid the failures that

00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:50.330 align:middle line:90%
have to do with market design.

00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:51.760 align:middle line:90%
So that's the agenda for today.

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:55.270 align:middle line:84%
Mostly, it's conceptual
and notational.

00:11:55.270 --> 00:11:57.760 align:middle line:84%
And I have
deliberately taken out

00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:00.520 align:middle line:84%
a lot of the notation
necessary to look

00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:03.380 align:middle line:84%
at the actual mapping,
because it gets quite tedious,

00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:03.880 align:middle line:90%
actually.

00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:05.500 align:middle line:84%
And it's not really
the main point.

00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:08.920 align:middle line:90%
OK, so here's the math tools.

00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:12.760 align:middle line:84%
What do we mean by a
fixed point of a function?

00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:15.700 align:middle line:84%
We're going to want to
solve nonlinear equations.

00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:19.780 align:middle line:84%
We want to know whether or
not there is a solution.

00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:23.590 align:middle line:84%
Those could be excess demand
equations in the Walrasian

00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:28.060 align:middle line:84%
case, or reaction
functions in the Nash case.

00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:29.660 align:middle line:90%
We'll get there momentarily.

00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:35.980 align:middle line:84%
So a function, f, maps some
domain, A, back into itself.

00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:38.290 align:middle line:84%
And we're looking for
a particular value

00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:42.040 align:middle line:84%
of x star in the domain such
that when you stick it in,

00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:43.240 align:middle line:90%
you get it back out.

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:46.780 align:middle line:84%
And what I mean by that
is, at x star, f of x star

00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:48.490 align:middle line:90%
is x star again.

00:12:48.490 --> 00:12:51.220 align:middle line:90%
The more formal statement--

00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:54.940 align:middle line:84%
Brower's Fix Point Theorem--
is at the bottom of this slide.

00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:59.680 align:middle line:84%
Let A be a subset of a finite
dimensional L dimensional

00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:01.120 align:middle line:90%
Euclidean space.

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:04.810 align:middle line:84%
And that quote "domain"
being non empty, convex,

00:13:04.810 --> 00:13:10.120 align:middle line:84%
and compact," and f maps
that domain back into itself,

00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:15.490 align:middle line:84%
A to A, f is continuous,
that's enough conditions

00:13:15.490 --> 00:13:19.360 align:middle line:84%
on f and on this set
A such that there

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:22.720 align:middle line:84%
is a special point,
x star, in A,

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:24.610 align:middle line:84%
and when you stick it
into the function f,

00:13:24.610 --> 00:13:26.300 align:middle line:90%
you get x star right back again.

00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:29.260 align:middle line:84%
So what's going
on is pretty well

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.780 align:middle line:84%
captured by this
classic picture.

00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:35.830 align:middle line:84%
The set A is just
the integral 0 to 1.

00:13:35.830 --> 00:13:38.360 align:middle line:90%
And that's the domain.

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:42.310 align:middle line:84%
And the range is the
same, A to A, 0 to 1.

00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:45.250 align:middle line:84%
And this function f
is being drawn here

00:13:45.250 --> 00:13:47.530 align:middle line:90%
as a continuous function.

00:13:47.530 --> 00:13:51.250 align:middle line:84%
And the challenge would be,
how could you possibly draw

00:13:51.250 --> 00:13:53.620 align:middle line:84%
this function, which
has to be continuous,

00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:57.850 align:middle line:84%
in a way that it doesn't
cross the green diagonal?

00:13:57.850 --> 00:13:59.500 align:middle line:90%
This one clearly does.

00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:03.160 align:middle line:84%
So where it crosses, by
definition of the 45 degree

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:08.050 align:middle line:84%
line we found, x star, we
get back what we put in.

00:14:08.050 --> 00:14:08.620 align:middle line:90%
So, oh, no.

00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:10.240 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to go down there.

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:12.640 align:middle line:84%
How about we hug
the axis up here?

00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:17.320 align:middle line:84%
But even then, where
f of x is 1 for all x,

00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:21.130 align:middle line:84%
it would still be a fixed
point at the end point.

00:14:21.130 --> 00:14:23.770 align:middle line:90%
So anyway, that's the intuition.

00:14:23.770 --> 00:14:28.397 align:middle line:84%
It's pretty clearly sufficient
to have the fixed point.

00:14:28.397 --> 00:14:29.230 align:middle line:90%
And when you don't--

00:14:29.230 --> 00:14:32.830 align:middle line:84%
I'll show you a picture--
it's because it'll jump over.

00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:35.530 align:middle line:84%
It will not be
defined exactly where

00:14:35.530 --> 00:14:39.340 align:middle line:84%
it would need to be defined
to cross the 45 degree line.

00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:42.100 align:middle line:84%
This is a generalization
of Brower's theorem.

00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:45.610 align:middle line:84%
It's Kakutani's
Fixed Point Theorem.

00:14:45.610 --> 00:14:48.400 align:middle line:84%
A-- still the same,
a non empty subset

00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:51.940 align:middle line:84%
of a finite dimensional
Euclidean space.

00:14:51.940 --> 00:14:56.680 align:middle line:84%
f, however, doesn't have unique
single values in the range.

00:14:56.680 --> 00:14:59.200 align:middle line:84%
It could be a whole
set of values of f.

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:01.720 align:middle line:90%
It's called a correspondence.

00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:05.040 align:middle line:90%
So we pick x in the domain.

00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:08.220 align:middle line:84%
There's a plausible
entire set of values--

00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:11.790 align:middle line:84%
f of x, which is a
subset of A. So then,

00:15:11.790 --> 00:15:13.740 align:middle line:84%
we just look at the
conditions on A,

00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:17.100 align:middle line:84%
which are already given to
us to be non empty, compact,

00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:21.870 align:middle line:84%
and convex, exactly as in
Brower, f of x is non empty.

00:15:21.870 --> 00:15:24.900 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's been
implicitly assumed

00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:27.900 align:middle line:90%
that it has a value for every x.

00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:29.220 align:middle line:90%
And here's some more--

00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:31.920 align:middle line:90%
convex-valued and closed.

00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:34.180 align:middle line:84%
So although it wasn't
about this, the question

00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:38.020 align:middle line:84%
he asked at the very
beginning-- so it's like this.

00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:40.920 align:middle line:84%
So f is convex-valued
means take any two

00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:45.930 align:middle line:84%
points in f of x, the convex
combination is also in f of x.

00:15:45.930 --> 00:15:53.400 align:middle line:84%
And closed simply means that if
you have a sequence of points,

00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:58.920 align:middle line:84%
xn and yn converging to x and y,
with every point along the way

00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:01.680 align:middle line:84%
in the sequence
satisfying yn, an element

00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:06.840 align:middle line:84%
of f of xn, then the limit
y is an element of f of x.

00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:09.330 align:middle line:90%
So again, it doesn't jump.

00:16:09.330 --> 00:16:12.060 align:middle line:84%
And then, Kakutani
tells us that these

00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:16.260 align:middle line:84%
are sufficient assumptions
for us to have a fixed point.

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:18.870 align:middle line:84%
I wish this had been
written with a star here.

00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:22.170 align:middle line:84%
If x star is an
element of A, then x

00:16:22.170 --> 00:16:26.070 align:middle line:84%
star is an element of
f of x star, not equal.

00:16:26.070 --> 00:16:28.650 align:middle line:84%
Because we have a
correspondence, just

00:16:28.650 --> 00:16:30.210 align:middle line:90%
an element of.

00:16:30.210 --> 00:16:33.870 align:middle line:84%
So here is the jumpy picture
that I promised you--

00:16:33.870 --> 00:16:35.610 align:middle line:90%
the two exceptions.

00:16:35.610 --> 00:16:40.320 align:middle line:84%
F has to be convex-valued and
continuous, in some sense,

00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:41.700 align:middle line:90%
or have a closed graph.

00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:46.080 align:middle line:84%
Here, it's not convex-valued
at this particular point

00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:47.670 align:middle line:90%
in the domain.

00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:50.280 align:middle line:84%
It is not true that
any linear combination

00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:53.250 align:middle line:84%
of points in the range
are also in the range.

00:16:53.250 --> 00:16:56.490 align:middle line:84%
And in particular, there's
nothing in the middle here.

00:16:56.490 --> 00:16:59.880 align:middle line:84%
So it jumps over
that 45 degree line.

00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:03.240 align:middle line:84%
Likewise here, there's
a sequence of points--

00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:05.670 align:middle line:90%
actually, unique points.

00:17:05.670 --> 00:17:09.190 align:middle line:84%
Correspondence allows
single value functions.

00:17:09.190 --> 00:17:12.180 align:middle line:84%
But when you get
here, the limit point

00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:20.609 align:middle line:84%
is no longer consistent with
f of x being a point of x.

00:17:20.609 --> 00:17:23.220 align:middle line:90%
And the function drops down.

00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:26.099 align:middle line:90%
x is here. f of x is here.

00:17:26.099 --> 00:17:27.150 align:middle line:90%
That's fine.

00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:28.200 align:middle line:90%
That jump is fine.

00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:30.900 align:middle line:84%
But the problem is, this
can be achieved by a limit.

00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:34.020 align:middle line:84%
And the point in the
limit is not in the pair.

00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:37.710 align:middle line:84%
That's that little
Cheerio with a hole.

00:17:37.710 --> 00:17:40.380 align:middle line:84%
That's not an
argument of f of x.

00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:44.910 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, this is what can
go wrong to motivate the quote

00:17:44.910 --> 00:17:46.930 align:middle line:90%
"sufficient assumptions."

00:17:46.930 --> 00:17:50.230 align:middle line:84%
Now, we get to the
first application--

00:17:50.230 --> 00:17:53.000 align:middle line:90%
existence of Walrasian prices.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.390 align:middle line:90%
We want sufficient conditions.

00:17:55.390 --> 00:17:57.280 align:middle line:84%
Consider a pure
exchange economy.

00:17:57.280 --> 00:17:59.200 align:middle line:90%
Get rid of production.

00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:02.320 align:middle line:84%
Have a strictly positive
aggregate endowment.

00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:06.010 align:middle line:84%
Assume that preferences are
rational, locally nonsatiated,

00:18:06.010 --> 00:18:07.790 align:middle line:90%
and continuous.

00:18:07.790 --> 00:18:10.240 align:middle line:84%
In fact, preferences
can be represented

00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:12.280 align:middle line:90%
by utility functions.

00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:15.340 align:middle line:84%
The consumption set
is, say, all of the L

00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:18.650 align:middle line:90%
dimensional non-negative space.

00:18:18.650 --> 00:18:21.110 align:middle line:90%
So we define three things here.

00:18:21.110 --> 00:18:25.420 align:middle line:84%
First of all, we're defining
the maximizing demand.

00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:29.590 align:middle line:84%
So we maximize utility
function subject to consumption

00:18:29.590 --> 00:18:33.340 align:middle line:84%
being in the consumption set,
subject to not spending more

00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:37.180 align:middle line:84%
than the valuation of the
endowment at this price, p.

00:18:37.180 --> 00:18:41.080 align:middle line:84%
That's the definition
of demand for all prices

00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:43.120 align:middle line:90%
p given parametrically.

00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:46.480 align:middle line:90%
Z will call excess demand--

00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:50.320 align:middle line:84%
namely, not total demand, but
the difference between demand

00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:51.550 align:middle line:90%
and the endowment.

00:18:51.550 --> 00:18:54.220 align:middle line:84%
This is typically positive
if they're buying stuff.

00:18:54.220 --> 00:18:56.500 align:middle line:84%
It could be negative if
they're selling stuff.

00:18:56.500 --> 00:19:00.310 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, we just
call it excess demand.

00:19:00.310 --> 00:19:03.220 align:middle line:84%
And then, we take the sum
of the excess demands,

00:19:03.220 --> 00:19:05.050 align:middle line:90%
summing over all the households.

00:19:05.050 --> 00:19:09.400 align:middle line:84%
This is I, capital I. So this
is the aggregate excess demand

00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:10.940 align:middle line:90%
function.

00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:17.480 align:middle line:84%
Now, if we can find a price,
p, such that this z of p is 0,

00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:19.200 align:middle line:90%
then we're done.

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:20.030 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:19:20.030 --> 00:19:22.700 align:middle line:84%
Because we found
the p such that when

00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:25.820 align:middle line:84%
we march across the
different households,

00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:29.940 align:middle line:84%
we have excess demand being
positive for some people.

00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:33.230 align:middle line:84%
But since it has to sum
to 0, that excess demand

00:19:33.230 --> 00:19:35.460 align:middle line:90%
has to be negative.

00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:39.440 align:middle line:84%
So whatever gets supplied by
households, some households,

00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:41.540 align:middle line:84%
gets demanded by
other households.

00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:44.780 align:middle line:84%
By the way, all of this is
written in vector notation,

00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:45.980 align:middle line:90%
although it's not obvious.

00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:48.230 align:middle line:90%
You have to be reminded of that.

00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:52.640 align:middle line:84%
We want to be able to clear each
and every one of the L markets

00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:54.670 align:middle line:90%
with this price vector p.

00:19:54.670 --> 00:19:57.260 align:middle line:84%
OK, so here's a
picture where it works,

00:19:57.260 --> 00:19:59.210 align:middle line:90%
and a picture where it doesn't.

00:19:59.210 --> 00:20:01.820 align:middle line:84%
The aggregate
endowment is over here.

00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:05.970 align:middle line:84%
And we'll look, despite
what I just said, at good 1.

00:20:05.970 --> 00:20:07.310 align:middle line:90%
Take the price of good 1.

00:20:07.310 --> 00:20:09.920 align:middle line:84%
Here's the demand
for it, total demand.

00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:11.600 align:middle line:90%
This is total supply.

00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:14.810 align:middle line:90%
Excess demand hits 0 right here.

00:20:14.810 --> 00:20:15.560 align:middle line:90%
We're done.

00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:16.850 align:middle line:90%
We found a price--

00:20:16.850 --> 00:20:19.520 align:middle line:84%
this price, where
excess demand is 0,

00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:21.720 align:middle line:84%
because supply is
equal to demand.

00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:25.070 align:middle line:84%
But if it were to happen that
somehow those demand curves

00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:30.140 align:middle line:84%
jump, then for some prices,
excess demand is positive

00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:31.710 align:middle line:90%
and for others, it's negative.

00:20:31.710 --> 00:20:36.510 align:middle line:84%
And we would not find
0 of that function.

00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:38.780 align:middle line:90%
So when can this happen?

00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:42.260 align:middle line:84%
I didn't draw the picture here,
but if you take an Edgeworth

00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:45.890 align:middle line:84%
box diagram, you can
imagine that households

00:20:45.890 --> 00:20:50.630 align:middle line:84%
might jump from wanting all of
good x to wanting all of good y

00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:51.950 align:middle line:90%
at a certain price.

00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:55.010 align:middle line:84%
And maybe if you set it up
even with more restrictions,

00:20:55.010 --> 00:20:58.520 align:middle line:84%
they're not very happy with
stuff in the middle, either--

00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:02.750 align:middle line:84%
for example, with not
concave indifference curves,

00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:04.517 align:middle line:90%
but convex indifference curves.

00:21:04.517 --> 00:21:06.350 align:middle line:84%
The linear stuff won't
work, because they'll

00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:07.850 align:middle line:90%
be happy in the middle.

00:21:07.850 --> 00:21:10.370 align:middle line:84%
But when it's a
concave function,

00:21:10.370 --> 00:21:15.980 align:middle line:84%
or convex indifference curves,
or concave upper contour sets,

00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:19.160 align:middle line:84%
then they will only
want to go to extremes.

00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:21.200 align:middle line:84%
And that's going
to create a hole.

00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:24.650 align:middle line:90%
So I think it's not written out.

00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:27.170 align:middle line:84%
But you're going to see
it indirectly in a minute.

00:21:27.170 --> 00:21:30.860 align:middle line:84%
We need sufficient convexity
of consumption sets,

00:21:30.860 --> 00:21:33.200 align:middle line:84%
and concavity of
utility functions,

00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:35.690 align:middle line:84%
and if we had production,
some convexity

00:21:35.690 --> 00:21:40.160 align:middle line:84%
assumptions there in order
to get the conditions to be

00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:42.050 align:middle line:90%
able to use the fixed point.

00:21:42.050 --> 00:21:44.090 align:middle line:84%
Remember, the
fixed point assumes

00:21:44.090 --> 00:21:48.440 align:middle line:84%
that functions are
continuous and the domain

00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:51.890 align:middle line:84%
of the underlying
mapping is closed,

00:21:51.890 --> 00:21:53.960 align:middle line:90%
and convex, and nonempty.

00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:57.840 align:middle line:84%
Now, I could have put
many more slides in here.

00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:00.230 align:middle line:84%
In earlier years, I
used to have them.

00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:02.000 align:middle line:90%
It's surprisingly tedious.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:06.350 align:middle line:84%
This was the work done by
Arrow, and Debreu, and McKenzie

00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:08.660 align:middle line:90%
in the '50s and the '60s.

00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:12.050 align:middle line:84%
And the mapping is
not as straightforward

00:22:12.050 --> 00:22:12.950 align:middle line:90%
as you might hope.

00:22:12.950 --> 00:22:15.880 align:middle line:84%
It's certainly nothing
like these pictures.

00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:19.170 align:middle line:84%
But I think the intuition
is fine for today.

00:22:19.170 --> 00:22:21.670 align:middle line:84%
Now, much more relevant
since, we just did it,

00:22:21.670 --> 00:22:24.070 align:middle line:90%
would be Negishi's mapping.

00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:27.490 align:middle line:84%
Instead of looking for
prices that clear markets,

00:22:27.490 --> 00:22:30.430 align:middle line:84%
we're going to look for
Pareto weights using

00:22:30.430 --> 00:22:33.340 align:middle line:84%
the first and second
welfare theorem.

00:22:33.340 --> 00:22:36.190 align:middle line:84%
Again, exactly what
we did last time.

00:22:36.190 --> 00:22:38.200 align:middle line:84%
The first welfare
theorem tells us

00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:41.080 align:middle line:84%
that the competitive equilibrium
will be Pareto optimal.

00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:43.630 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to be
having enough assumptions so

00:22:43.630 --> 00:22:45.700 align:middle line:84%
that that theorem
is true-- local non

00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:48.040 align:middle line:90%
satiation and rationality.

00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:51.610 align:middle line:84%
So we know, if it's optimal,
there exists Pareto weights

00:22:51.610 --> 00:22:56.500 align:middle line:84%
lambda such that when we
solve the lambda weighted max

00:22:56.500 --> 00:23:00.640 align:middle line:84%
problem, we will get that
particular Pareto optimal

00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:01.600 align:middle line:90%
allocation.

00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:04.570 align:middle line:84%
Not any lambda--
particular lambdas

00:23:04.570 --> 00:23:08.650 align:middle line:84%
that generate that particular
Pareto optimal allocation

00:23:08.650 --> 00:23:11.600 align:middle line:84%
corresponding to the
Walrasian equilibrium.

00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:14.500 align:middle line:90%
So that's Negishi's method.

00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:18.310 align:middle line:84%
Instead of trying to find
prices that clear markets,

00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:21.370 align:middle line:84%
it's going to try to
find Pareto weights--

00:23:21.370 --> 00:23:23.770 align:middle line:84%
in particular,
Pareto weights such

00:23:23.770 --> 00:23:27.100 align:middle line:84%
that we're searching
as we vary the Pareto

00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:31.420 align:middle line:84%
weights over the space of Pareto
optimal allocations in such

00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:34.870 align:middle line:84%
a way that the fixed
point of a mapping

00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:38.950 align:middle line:84%
will be the particular
Pareto weights that generate

00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:40.870 align:middle line:90%
the Walrasian allocation.

00:23:40.870 --> 00:23:46.960 align:middle line:84%
And in particular, the valuation
of the expenditures associated

00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:49.900 align:middle line:84%
with the competitive
equilibrium is exactly

00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:54.230 align:middle line:84%
the valuation of wealth under
the private ownership economy.

00:23:54.230 --> 00:23:56.890 align:middle line:84%
So those are the words
and the notations coming.

00:23:56.890 --> 00:23:58.420 align:middle line:90%
It's three or four slides away.

00:23:58.420 --> 00:24:03.220 align:middle line:90%
OK, so what does Negishi do in--

00:24:03.220 --> 00:24:05.920 align:middle line:90%
he actually adds up over firms.

00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:08.710 align:middle line:84%
So we act like there's
just one single firm.

00:24:08.710 --> 00:24:11.050 align:middle line:90%
That's perfectly fine to do.

00:24:11.050 --> 00:24:13.960 align:middle line:84%
It just makes the
notation easier.

00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:16.630 align:middle line:84%
And these assumptions
are pretty much what

00:24:16.630 --> 00:24:19.360 align:middle line:84%
we did last time when
we did the Lagrangian

00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:20.950 align:middle line:90%
and the second welfare theorem.

00:24:20.950 --> 00:24:23.740 align:middle line:84%
The consumption sets
are closed and convex.

00:24:23.740 --> 00:24:25.570 align:middle line:90%
Let's say they contain 0.

00:24:25.570 --> 00:24:27.580 align:middle line:84%
That's a little
bit more special.

00:24:27.580 --> 00:24:31.090 align:middle line:84%
Utility functions are
continuous concave functions

00:24:31.090 --> 00:24:33.100 align:middle line:90%
with local non satiation.

00:24:33.100 --> 00:24:36.310 align:middle line:84%
We define an aggregate
consumption set,

00:24:36.310 --> 00:24:40.570 align:middle line:84%
the aggregate social endowment,
the aggregated production

00:24:40.570 --> 00:24:43.870 align:middle line:84%
of the representative
firm, which is also convex

00:24:43.870 --> 00:24:46.540 align:middle line:84%
and has a concave
transformation,

00:24:46.540 --> 00:24:50.050 align:middle line:84%
possibility of an action
in the production set,

00:24:50.050 --> 00:24:51.820 align:middle line:90%
and feasibility--

00:24:51.820 --> 00:24:55.000 align:middle line:84%
in particular, the existence
of an interior point,

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:59.770 align:middle line:84%
and that the feasible set
of allocations is compact.

00:24:59.770 --> 00:25:02.410 align:middle line:84%
This compactness
may seem strange.

00:25:02.410 --> 00:25:04.820 align:middle line:84%
And I can come back
to that if you want.

00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:07.990 align:middle line:84%
Certainly, if you had an
Edgeworth box economy,

00:25:07.990 --> 00:25:11.380 align:middle line:84%
the set of aggregate
resources is fixed and finite.

00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:14.260 align:middle line:84%
Production creates the
possibility of creating more,

00:25:14.260 --> 00:25:17.210 align:middle line:84%
but you have a finite
number of inputs, and so on.

00:25:17.210 --> 00:25:20.290 align:middle line:84%
So in the end, you end
up with a compact set.

00:25:20.290 --> 00:25:21.220 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:25:21.220 --> 00:25:24.640 align:middle line:90%
So Negishi's theorem, 1960--

00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:26.470 align:middle line:84%
suppose we have a
private ownership

00:25:26.470 --> 00:25:29.020 align:middle line:84%
economy with this
string of elements

00:25:29.020 --> 00:25:33.370 align:middle line:84%
that you're now very familiar
with that satisfy A.1

00:25:33.370 --> 00:25:37.760 align:middle line:84%
through A.4, all the convexity,
and concavity, and continuity,

00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:38.260 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:25:38.260 --> 00:25:39.820 align:middle line:90%
Then, voila.

00:25:39.820 --> 00:25:42.250 align:middle line:84%
There exists a
Walrasian equilibrium.

00:25:42.250 --> 00:25:44.740 align:middle line:90%
x star, y star, p star.

00:25:44.740 --> 00:25:48.460 align:middle line:84%
Let's assume utility
functions are differentiable.

00:25:48.460 --> 00:25:49.600 align:middle line:90%
F is differentiable.

00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:53.200 align:middle line:84%
We did that anyway with
the second welfare theorem.

00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:57.040 align:middle line:84%
So the key here is that
Pareto optimal allocations

00:25:57.040 --> 00:25:59.080 align:middle line:90%
are indexed by lambda.

00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:04.420 align:middle line:84%
This simple-looking problem,
which is, pick a lambda vector,

00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:07.000 align:middle line:84%
maximize lambda-weighted
sums of utilities

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:10.060 align:middle line:84%
by choices of consumption
and production

00:26:10.060 --> 00:26:13.990 align:middle line:84%
that are in consumption
sets, production sets,

00:26:13.990 --> 00:26:16.210 align:middle line:84%
and satisfy the
resource constraint

00:26:16.210 --> 00:26:18.130 align:middle line:90%
for each of the L goods.

00:26:18.130 --> 00:26:20.140 align:middle line:84%
You saw a slide
like this last time

00:26:20.140 --> 00:26:22.450 align:middle line:90%
with the second welfare theorem.

00:26:22.450 --> 00:26:25.180 align:middle line:84%
Here, we're going
to explicitly index

00:26:25.180 --> 00:26:29.540 align:middle line:84%
the solution of a given
lambda as x and y lambda.

00:26:29.540 --> 00:26:32.620 align:middle line:84%
So for a given lambda, a
particular target Pareto

00:26:32.620 --> 00:26:34.720 align:middle line:84%
optimal allocation
is the solution

00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:36.350 align:middle line:90%
to this Pareto problem.

00:26:36.350 --> 00:26:38.590 align:middle line:90%
Now again, said this earlier.

00:26:38.590 --> 00:26:42.040 align:middle line:84%
We know there is a lambda, of
course, that generates a Pareto

00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:46.000 align:middle line:84%
optimal allocation that
corresponds to the Walrasian

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:47.110 align:middle line:90%
equilibrium.

00:26:47.110 --> 00:26:49.870 align:middle line:84%
And more generally, from
the second welfare theorem,

00:26:49.870 --> 00:26:53.050 align:middle line:84%
any Pareto optimal
allocation hence

00:26:53.050 --> 00:26:56.500 align:middle line:84%
has a particular
lambda such that it

00:26:56.500 --> 00:27:00.760 align:middle line:84%
can be achieved as a competitive
equilibrium with transfers.

00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:03.790 align:middle line:84%
So let's just search in
the space of Pareto optimal

00:27:03.790 --> 00:27:06.940 align:middle line:84%
allocations till we
find the right one,

00:27:06.940 --> 00:27:09.160 align:middle line:90%
find the Walrasian one.

00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:11.830 align:middle line:84%
And in particular,
the prices are

00:27:11.830 --> 00:27:14.810 align:middle line:90%
going to happen along the way.

00:27:14.810 --> 00:27:17.390 align:middle line:84%
They are the Lagrange
multipliers associated

00:27:17.390 --> 00:27:18.710 align:middle line:90%
with the resource constraints.

00:27:18.710 --> 00:27:23.190 align:middle line:84%
This is exactly, in fact, the
same notation from last time,

00:27:23.190 --> 00:27:27.050 align:middle line:84%
except that this gamma,
which is the price vector,

00:27:27.050 --> 00:27:31.040 align:middle line:84%
is indexed by lambda when
we matched up, remember,

00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:33.020 align:middle line:84%
the consumer problem
with the first order

00:27:33.020 --> 00:27:35.270 align:middle line:84%
conditions in the
Walrasian equilibrium

00:27:35.270 --> 00:27:38.250 align:middle line:84%
with the first order conditions
of the Pareto problem.

00:27:38.250 --> 00:27:41.780 align:middle line:84%
And we also will get,
from the Pareto problem,

00:27:41.780 --> 00:27:45.600 align:middle line:84%
the consumer's allocation,
the firm's allocation,

00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:47.700 align:middle line:84%
these prices, again,
as I just mentioned,

00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:49.430 align:middle line:90%
and the wealth allocation.

00:27:49.430 --> 00:27:52.520 align:middle line:84%
And the wealth for a given
lambda for a given Pareto

00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:55.190 align:middle line:84%
optimal allocation
is just the valuation

00:27:55.190 --> 00:27:58.160 align:middle line:84%
at these Lagrange
multiplier prices

00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:02.330 align:middle line:84%
of the target Pareto
optimal x allocation.

00:28:02.330 --> 00:28:03.750 align:middle line:90%
This is a given.

00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:07.730 align:middle line:84%
I here is a household I.
We're summing over all the L

00:28:07.730 --> 00:28:09.630 align:middle line:90%
goods, finite number of them.

00:28:09.630 --> 00:28:14.150 align:middle line:90%
And so again, add lambda x hat.

00:28:14.150 --> 00:28:16.670 align:middle line:90%
Add lambda of L--

00:28:16.670 --> 00:28:19.400 align:middle line:90%
is the demand for the Lth good.

00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:21.140 align:middle line:84%
This is the price
of the Lth good.

00:28:21.140 --> 00:28:23.510 align:middle line:90%
We sum over all of the L goods.

00:28:23.510 --> 00:28:25.070 align:middle line:90%
We get total expenditures.

00:28:25.070 --> 00:28:27.290 align:middle line:90%
And we assign that wealth level.

00:28:27.290 --> 00:28:29.090 align:middle line:90%
You may remember that slide.

00:28:29.090 --> 00:28:30.810 align:middle line:90%
I said, why do we need this?

00:28:30.810 --> 00:28:34.070 align:middle line:84%
And I kept reminding you of
the global algorithm, which

00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:37.430 align:middle line:84%
is, we have to make sure the
assignments of wealth that

00:28:37.430 --> 00:28:42.110 align:middle line:84%
correspond with supporting
prices of the Pareto problem

00:28:42.110 --> 00:28:45.230 align:middle line:84%
sum up to the total
social endowment.

00:28:45.230 --> 00:28:49.030 align:middle line:90%
So you saw this before.

00:28:49.030 --> 00:28:50.960 align:middle line:90%
What are we looking for?

00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:53.770 align:middle line:84%
We're looking for an
assignment of wealth such

00:28:53.770 --> 00:28:57.820 align:middle line:84%
that the wealth is equal
to the valuation of wealth

00:28:57.820 --> 00:28:59.630 align:middle line:84%
in the private
ownership economy.

00:28:59.630 --> 00:29:02.740 align:middle line:84%
So this is just the
endowment of household I

00:29:02.740 --> 00:29:07.300 align:middle line:84%
plus household I's claim
on the shares of the firm.

00:29:07.300 --> 00:29:11.540 align:middle line:84%
You used to have theta
Ij summation over j,

00:29:11.540 --> 00:29:13.700 align:middle line:84%
but because for
simplicity we assumed

00:29:13.700 --> 00:29:16.430 align:middle line:84%
1 representative
aggregated firm,

00:29:16.430 --> 00:29:19.430 align:middle line:84%
we only need theta
I, not theta Ij.

00:29:19.430 --> 00:29:26.270 align:middle line:84%
It's I's claim on the profits
of the firm, the single firm.

00:29:26.270 --> 00:29:28.100 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, that's
private ownership.

00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:31.700 align:middle line:84%
So we're looking
for lambdas somehow.

00:29:31.700 --> 00:29:35.390 align:middle line:84%
And again, I didn't go much
further with the mapping.

00:29:35.390 --> 00:29:38.510 align:middle line:84%
We're going to iterate
on lambdas in such a way

00:29:38.510 --> 00:29:42.200 align:middle line:84%
that eventually, we define
the mapping in such a way

00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:45.650 align:middle line:84%
that the lambda that
we want will be a fixed

00:29:45.650 --> 00:29:48.890 align:middle line:84%
point of the mapping
and will satisfy

00:29:48.890 --> 00:29:52.400 align:middle line:84%
the valuation of expenditures
at that particular Pareto

00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:56.480 align:middle line:84%
optimum is exactly the
valuation of wealth

00:29:56.480 --> 00:29:59.130 align:middle line:84%
in the private
ownership economy.

00:29:59.130 --> 00:30:01.380 align:middle line:84%
Again, the mapping
is a bit more tedious

00:30:01.380 --> 00:30:05.170 align:middle line:90%
than you might hope for.

00:30:05.170 --> 00:30:08.190 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand, you can see
clearly from the second welfare

00:30:08.190 --> 00:30:12.670 align:middle line:84%
theorem how we were using
convexity, and continuity,

00:30:12.670 --> 00:30:13.360 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:16.380 align:middle line:84%
So perhaps it's
not too surprising,

00:30:16.380 --> 00:30:18.750 align:middle line:84%
at the end of the
day, that we end up

00:30:18.750 --> 00:30:22.050 align:middle line:90%
with sufficient assumptions to--

00:30:22.050 --> 00:30:22.845 align:middle line:90%
oh, here it is.

00:30:22.845 --> 00:30:25.470 align:middle line:90%
Here I am talking away.

00:30:25.470 --> 00:30:31.470 align:middle line:84%
Sufficient assumptions to get
this particular lambda star

00:30:31.470 --> 00:30:35.060 align:middle line:90%
as the fixed point we want.

00:30:35.060 --> 00:30:37.040 align:middle line:84%
I said this in words,
and I should have

00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:39.980 align:middle line:90%
had this slide on the board.

00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:43.790 align:middle line:84%
Valuation of expenditures
equals the valuation

00:30:43.790 --> 00:30:47.920 align:middle line:84%
of wealth in the private
ownership economy.

00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:49.770 align:middle line:84%
So there's really
two ways to search

00:30:49.770 --> 00:30:52.140 align:middle line:90%
for a competitive equilibrium.

00:30:52.140 --> 00:30:57.390 align:middle line:84%
We can search in price space, or
we can search in lambda space.

00:30:57.390 --> 00:31:01.350 align:middle line:84%
It's curious that in both
cases, we need a simplex.

00:31:01.350 --> 00:31:05.040 align:middle line:84%
To remind you, a
simplex is the space

00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:08.370 align:middle line:84%
where each of the elements
is non-negative greater than

00:31:08.370 --> 00:31:12.030 align:middle line:84%
or equal to 0, and the sum
of the elements adds up to 1.

00:31:12.030 --> 00:31:14.820 align:middle line:84%
So prices add up
to 1, because we

00:31:14.820 --> 00:31:18.840 align:middle line:84%
have a degree of freedom for
the normalization of prices,

00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:22.230 align:middle line:84%
because of homogeneity
of degrees 0,

00:31:22.230 --> 00:31:24.900 align:middle line:84%
and homogeneity of
degree 1, I guess.

00:31:24.900 --> 00:31:30.150 align:middle line:84%
And also in the lambda weights,
the lambdas are normalized.

00:31:30.150 --> 00:31:31.440 align:middle line:90%
They're non-negative.

00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:33.270 align:middle line:90%
And they sum up to 1.

00:31:33.270 --> 00:31:35.010 align:middle line:90%
So that's another simplex.

00:31:35.010 --> 00:31:37.710 align:middle line:84%
But on the other
hand, the dimensions

00:31:37.710 --> 00:31:41.010 align:middle line:84%
may be easier in
the lambda space.

00:31:41.010 --> 00:31:45.330 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there are more goods than
there are types of households.

00:31:45.330 --> 00:31:50.130 align:middle line:84%
We have inputs and
outputs of all kinds.

00:31:50.130 --> 00:31:54.000 align:middle line:84%
There may be, at least
for economic modeling--

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:58.440 align:middle line:84%
we can think about a finite
number of types of households.

00:31:58.440 --> 00:32:01.560 align:middle line:84%
Maybe when you think about
wealth, we have rich and poor.

00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:03.390 align:middle line:90%
We have medians.

00:32:03.390 --> 00:32:05.760 align:middle line:90%
We have quartiles.

00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:08.460 align:middle line:84%
When we thought about
international trade,

00:32:08.460 --> 00:32:11.420 align:middle line:84%
we had households differing
by their endowments.

00:32:11.420 --> 00:32:12.420 align:middle line:90%
Some are laborers.

00:32:12.420 --> 00:32:14.770 align:middle line:90%
Some own the capital, and so on.

00:32:14.770 --> 00:32:19.200 align:middle line:84%
So typically, the number
of lambdas corresponding

00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:21.420 align:middle line:84%
to the number of
types of households

00:32:21.420 --> 00:32:24.840 align:middle line:84%
is less than the number
of prices we need.

00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:28.290 align:middle line:84%
And it's just easier,
therefore, to search and compute

00:32:28.290 --> 00:32:30.240 align:middle line:90%
in the lambda space.

00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:32.820 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, I thought you
might appreciate this,

00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:35.940 align:middle line:84%
because we just got done with
the second welfare theorem.

00:32:35.940 --> 00:32:38.910 align:middle line:84%
And this existence
proof uses that.

00:32:38.910 --> 00:32:42.030 align:middle line:84%
Now, lest we think
it's just elegant,

00:32:42.030 --> 00:32:45.450 align:middle line:84%
I turn to what's going
on in computer science--

00:32:45.450 --> 00:32:48.760 align:middle line:84%
namely, how to find the
Walrasian equilibrium.

00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:52.500 align:middle line:84%
So Echenique and
Wierman at Caltech,

00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:55.050 align:middle line:84%
actually, have some
really cool stuff.

00:32:55.050 --> 00:32:58.080 align:middle line:84%
It can actually be
pretty hard to find

00:32:58.080 --> 00:33:00.510 align:middle line:90%
the competitive equilibrium.

00:33:00.510 --> 00:33:02.130 align:middle line:90%
We draw simple pictures, right?

00:33:02.130 --> 00:33:04.980 align:middle line:90%
But you have lots of households.

00:33:04.980 --> 00:33:08.850 align:middle line:84%
And in particular, households
could be posting information

00:33:08.850 --> 00:33:09.780 align:middle line:90%
on websites.

00:33:09.780 --> 00:33:12.470 align:middle line:84%
And we want to run some
auction or something.

00:33:12.470 --> 00:33:14.220 align:middle line:84%
And hopefully, there
are enough households

00:33:14.220 --> 00:33:17.400 align:middle line:84%
that we're trying to get to
the Walrasian allocation.

00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:20.920 align:middle line:84%
It's not easy to
solve these things.

00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:23.850 align:middle line:84%
In fact, in general, it looks
like a very hard problem.

00:33:23.850 --> 00:33:27.940 align:middle line:84%
And look, the examples of how
to find it look relatively easy.

00:33:27.940 --> 00:33:30.930 align:middle line:84%
So there's this big
gap in the literature.

00:33:30.930 --> 00:33:33.690 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, these guys
discovered Negishi.

00:33:33.690 --> 00:33:36.540 align:middle line:90%
Everybody goes back to 1960.

00:33:36.540 --> 00:33:40.380 align:middle line:84%
And they have an
algorithm that works

00:33:40.380 --> 00:33:43.350 align:middle line:84%
to find the competitive
equilibria using

00:33:43.350 --> 00:33:47.180 align:middle line:84%
Negishi's algorithm
that I just showed you.

00:33:47.180 --> 00:33:49.200 align:middle line:90%
And this one is related.

00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:52.840 align:middle line:84%
Computing Walrasian
equilibria fast.

00:33:52.840 --> 00:33:56.080 align:middle line:84%
[CHUCKLES] So again,
there's stuff here.

00:33:56.080 --> 00:34:01.060 align:middle line:84%
Although it's cool in the
sense of writing a code

00:34:01.060 --> 00:34:02.290 align:middle line:90%
that iterates.

00:34:02.290 --> 00:34:04.480 align:middle line:84%
And you want to know
the time that it

00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:06.320 align:middle line:90%
takes to find the solution.

00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:09.190 align:middle line:84%
And hopefully, that's not
going up exponentially

00:34:09.190 --> 00:34:11.560 align:middle line:84%
with the number of households,
or the number of goods,

00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:12.909 align:middle line:90%
or something.

00:34:12.909 --> 00:34:15.400 align:middle line:90%
So they want it to work fast.

00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:19.300 align:middle line:84%
So they don't want to evaluate
derivatives all the time.

00:34:19.300 --> 00:34:21.429 align:middle line:84%
So they figured out
this algorithm that

00:34:21.429 --> 00:34:23.590 align:middle line:90%
makes a call to the oracle.

00:34:23.590 --> 00:34:27.850 align:middle line:84%
And the oracle, when consulted,
will tell them the derivative

00:34:27.850 --> 00:34:30.020 align:middle line:90%
of the excess demand curve.

00:34:30.020 --> 00:34:31.380 align:middle line:90%
And so they've got this down.

00:34:31.380 --> 00:34:36.550 align:middle line:84%
They only have to consult the
oracle relatively few times.

00:34:36.550 --> 00:34:37.719 align:middle line:90%
And it's polynomial.

00:34:37.719 --> 00:34:42.040 align:middle line:84%
And so they can-- this
algorithm works pretty quickly.

00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:44.139 align:middle line:84%
This language of
consulting oracles

00:34:44.139 --> 00:34:46.750 align:middle line:84%
is used in computer
science any time

00:34:46.750 --> 00:34:51.460 align:middle line:84%
you want to go to an
external data source.

00:34:51.460 --> 00:34:55.210 align:middle line:84%
And could be rainfall, or
stock prices, or whatever.

00:34:55.210 --> 00:34:57.670 align:middle line:84%
And then, bring
that into the code--

00:34:57.670 --> 00:34:59.760 align:middle line:90%
like The Matrix oracle.

00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:05.020 align:middle line:84%
OK, let's go to another
concept of equilibrium,

00:35:05.020 --> 00:35:09.340 align:middle line:84%
Nash equilibria, and define
a strategic form game.

00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:11.280 align:middle line:90%
Let me back up a second.

00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:14.500 align:middle line:84%
The Walrasian
equilibrium is fine--

00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:16.990 align:middle line:84%
say, prices such
that when everyone

00:35:16.990 --> 00:35:20.080 align:middle line:84%
takes those prices as
given and maximizes,

00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:22.570 align:middle line:84%
then we look at the
resource constraint,

00:35:22.570 --> 00:35:27.460 align:middle line:84%
we find the prices such
that excess demands are 0.

00:35:27.460 --> 00:35:30.550 align:middle line:84%
But that does beg the issue
of where the heck the prices

00:35:30.550 --> 00:35:32.050 align:middle line:90%
are coming from.

00:35:32.050 --> 00:35:35.590 align:middle line:84%
Even if we have algorithms
for finding them,

00:35:35.590 --> 00:35:37.750 align:middle line:90%
that's a step along the way.

00:35:37.750 --> 00:35:40.750 align:middle line:84%
The strategic form
games are ways

00:35:40.750 --> 00:35:45.100 align:middle line:84%
to be very explicit about
the strategies and outcomes

00:35:45.100 --> 00:35:47.050 align:middle line:90%
that traders are using.

00:35:47.050 --> 00:35:49.690 align:middle line:84%
And again, I'll link this
up to the Walrasian price

00:35:49.690 --> 00:35:51.075 align:middle line:90%
momentarily.

00:35:51.075 --> 00:35:54.110 align:middle line:84%
OK, so here are
some definitions.

00:35:54.110 --> 00:35:57.250 align:middle line:84%
A strategic form game
has a finite number

00:35:57.250 --> 00:36:00.430 align:middle line:84%
of players, capital I,
script I. There there's

00:36:00.430 --> 00:36:04.750 align:middle line:84%
a set of possible actions
for each player, S sub

00:36:04.750 --> 00:36:09.940 align:middle line:84%
I. A particular action,
little si, is in big SI.

00:36:09.940 --> 00:36:13.960 align:middle line:84%
So that's a particular action
in a set of all possible actions

00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:16.210 align:middle line:90%
that define the game.

00:36:16.210 --> 00:36:20.080 align:middle line:84%
And the payoff functions--
look like utility functions--

00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:23.440 align:middle line:84%
map the actions
into real numbers.

00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:27.250 align:middle line:84%
But this vector, capital
S here, is actually

00:36:27.250 --> 00:36:30.850 align:middle line:84%
the actions of all the players,
unlike, say, in a Walrasian

00:36:30.850 --> 00:36:35.020 align:middle line:84%
equilibrium, where prices are
given and you choose demands.

00:36:35.020 --> 00:36:38.380 align:middle line:84%
Here, we need to map
explicitly the actions of each

00:36:38.380 --> 00:36:41.380 align:middle line:84%
and every player in order
to determine the outcome,

00:36:41.380 --> 00:36:45.190 align:middle line:84%
and hence determine the
utility of each player.

00:36:45.190 --> 00:36:47.290 align:middle line:90%
Here's some convenient notation.

00:36:47.290 --> 00:36:51.190 align:middle line:84%
S of minus I means
everybody but I.

00:36:51.190 --> 00:36:54.670 align:middle line:84%
So it's the particular
actions of all players j

00:36:54.670 --> 00:36:57.430 align:middle line:90%
excluding player I.

00:36:57.430 --> 00:37:01.690 align:middle line:84%
Likewise, capital S sub I is
the set of all possible actions

00:37:01.690 --> 00:37:06.160 align:middle line:84%
over all players other
than I. And finally,

00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:10.150 align:middle line:84%
this notation S
sub I S sub minus I

00:37:10.150 --> 00:37:12.670 align:middle line:90%
is the strategy profile.

00:37:12.670 --> 00:37:15.400 align:middle line:84%
It's particularly
relevant for player I,

00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:20.080 align:middle line:84%
because it has his or her
own action in there, S sub I,

00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:23.260 align:middle line:84%
but also as a summary,
the actions of all

00:37:23.260 --> 00:37:26.310 align:middle line:90%
the other players, S 0 I.

00:37:26.310 --> 00:37:30.910 align:middle line:84%
OK, so these are the definitions
of a strategic form game--

00:37:30.910 --> 00:37:35.000 align:middle line:90%
actions, utilities, and so on.

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:39.520 align:middle line:84%
So a strategy is how
to play the game, how

00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:42.070 align:middle line:90%
to choose particular actions.

00:37:42.070 --> 00:37:47.260 align:middle line:84%
It's as if you were writing
code to tell yourself

00:37:47.260 --> 00:37:52.000 align:middle line:84%
what to do as a function of
what everyone else is doing.

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:54.180 align:middle line:90%
So this can be easy or hard.

00:37:54.180 --> 00:37:57.150 align:middle line:84%
Nowadays, you could program
computers to play chess.

00:37:57.150 --> 00:38:00.220 align:middle line:84%
But that's thought to be
a pretty hard problem.

00:38:00.220 --> 00:38:03.690 align:middle line:84%
But this is the way we think
about agents choosing what

00:38:03.690 --> 00:38:06.430 align:middle line:90%
to do in a strategic form game.

00:38:06.430 --> 00:38:10.530 align:middle line:84%
So instead of jumping to a
notion of a Nash equilibrium

00:38:10.530 --> 00:38:15.330 align:middle line:84%
right away, let's think
about probability measures

00:38:15.330 --> 00:38:17.905 align:middle line:90%
over pure strategies.

00:38:17.905 --> 00:38:19.530 align:middle line:84%
But let me just say
from the beginning,

00:38:19.530 --> 00:38:21.290 align:middle line:90%
why are we doing this?

00:38:21.290 --> 00:38:25.700 align:middle line:84%
If you thought there's a finite
discrete number of actions

00:38:25.700 --> 00:38:29.030 align:middle line:84%
for two players, then player
one could do one thing,

00:38:29.030 --> 00:38:32.750 align:middle line:84%
and conditioned on that, player
to would choose his thing.

00:38:32.750 --> 00:38:35.210 align:middle line:84%
And again, conditioned on
what player two is doing,

00:38:35.210 --> 00:38:39.120 align:middle line:84%
player one wants to change his
mind and do something else.

00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:40.970 align:middle line:84%
So in principle, it
could jump all around

00:38:40.970 --> 00:38:44.120 align:middle line:84%
and never find a set
of consistent actions.

00:38:44.120 --> 00:38:48.590 align:middle line:84%
But if instead we think
about each player choosing

00:38:48.590 --> 00:38:52.460 align:middle line:84%
his or her action at random,
then we're back to the simplex.

00:38:52.460 --> 00:38:54.530 align:middle line:84%
Because the set of
probability numbers

00:38:54.530 --> 00:38:57.603 align:middle line:84%
are going to be non-negative
and add up to 1.

00:38:57.603 --> 00:38:59.270 align:middle line:84%
So you can see where
we're going, right?

00:38:59.270 --> 00:39:02.270 align:middle line:84%
We're going to map
this into Kakutani.

00:39:02.270 --> 00:39:04.790 align:middle line:84%
So that's why,
right away, we start

00:39:04.790 --> 00:39:09.330 align:middle line:84%
talking about probability
measures over pure strategies.

00:39:09.330 --> 00:39:12.140 align:middle line:84%
So for example, if
you had two actions,

00:39:12.140 --> 00:39:14.600 align:middle line:84%
you could think about
this probability measure

00:39:14.600 --> 00:39:16.520 align:middle line:84%
as assigning a
probability of doing

00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:19.400 align:middle line:84%
one thing or the other
thing, or the probability

00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:21.360 align:middle line:84%
over any finite
number of things.

00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:26.540 align:middle line:84%
And we call these probability
measures mixed strategies,

00:39:26.540 --> 00:39:30.410 align:middle line:84%
sigma being the mixed
strategy of player

00:39:30.410 --> 00:39:33.800 align:middle line:84%
I in the set of all
probability measures

00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:36.650 align:middle line:90%
that put mass over actions.

00:39:36.650 --> 00:39:42.020 align:middle line:84%
So sigma sub I for player
I, sigma without the I

00:39:42.020 --> 00:39:46.040 align:middle line:84%
is a set of mixed
strategies over everybody,

00:39:46.040 --> 00:39:48.230 align:middle line:90%
over all the players.

00:39:48.230 --> 00:39:50.720 align:middle line:84%
And it is being assumed
here that there's

00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:54.980 align:middle line:84%
no coordination, that they're
randomizing independently.

00:39:54.980 --> 00:39:58.250 align:middle line:84%
Sigma minus I is
the mixed strategies

00:39:58.250 --> 00:40:00.800 align:middle line:90%
of every player other than I.

00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:06.590 align:middle line:84%
And you can think about the
utility function of player I

00:40:06.590 --> 00:40:11.400 align:middle line:84%
as a function of the vector of
sigma that everyone is playing.

00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:11.900 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:40:11.900 --> 00:40:16.280 align:middle line:84%
Because sigma includes not just
I, but all the other players.

00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:19.040 align:middle line:84%
It's a random way
of choosing actions.

00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:22.640 align:middle line:84%
And a function of a given set
of configuration of actions

00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:25.130 align:middle line:84%
will generate a
payoff, and hence

00:40:25.130 --> 00:40:28.250 align:middle line:84%
generate the utility
of each agent I.

00:40:28.250 --> 00:40:30.230 align:middle line:84%
So this is just
expected utility.

00:40:30.230 --> 00:40:34.280 align:middle line:84%
This is just a Von Neumann
Morgenstern expected utility

00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:37.370 align:middle line:84%
explicitly taking into
account the random way

00:40:37.370 --> 00:40:39.680 align:middle line:90%
that allocations are achieved.

00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:44.840 align:middle line:84%
And I've been a bit vague
about the strategy space, S.

00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:49.490 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, I said it was
finite, like two actions.

00:40:49.490 --> 00:40:51.410 align:middle line:84%
This bottom line
specification here

00:40:51.410 --> 00:40:56.090 align:middle line:84%
is like, there could be a
continuum of possible actions.

00:40:56.090 --> 00:41:00.406 align:middle line:84%
So we integrated rather
than summing things up.

00:41:00.406 --> 00:41:04.970 align:middle line:84%
OK, so let's finally
define a Nash equilibrium.

00:41:04.970 --> 00:41:12.140 align:middle line:84%
Mixed strategy Nash equilibrium
is a strategy profile star

00:41:12.140 --> 00:41:16.220 align:middle line:84%
for each and every
player such that player

00:41:16.220 --> 00:41:20.390 align:middle line:84%
I here takes as given
the mixed strategy,

00:41:20.390 --> 00:41:23.600 align:middle line:84%
the star mixed strategy
of all the other players,

00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:27.170 align:middle line:84%
and hopefully will find
the sigma I star for him

00:41:27.170 --> 00:41:30.530 align:middle line:84%
or herself is, in fact,
not worse in utility terms

00:41:30.530 --> 00:41:33.870 align:middle line:84%
than doing any other
mixed strategy.

00:41:33.870 --> 00:41:37.500 align:middle line:84%
So Nash is always, take as given
what everyone else is doing.

00:41:37.500 --> 00:41:41.010 align:middle line:84%
And then, you're fully
free to optimize.

00:41:41.010 --> 00:41:43.450 align:middle line:84%
And you can see
where this is going.

00:41:43.450 --> 00:41:44.855 align:middle line:90%
It's a bit more complicated.

00:41:44.855 --> 00:41:46.230 align:middle line:84%
We're going to
look for some kind

00:41:46.230 --> 00:41:48.730 align:middle line:84%
of fixed point in
these mixed strategies

00:41:48.730 --> 00:41:53.100 align:middle line:84%
so that when we put sigma star
in, we get sigma star back out.

00:41:53.100 --> 00:41:56.340 align:middle line:84%
One curious thing here,
not that it matters,

00:41:56.340 --> 00:41:59.820 align:middle line:84%
but it's interesting to think
about the out of equilibrium

00:41:59.820 --> 00:42:01.500 align:middle line:90%
problem of a given agent.

00:42:01.500 --> 00:42:05.130 align:middle line:84%
The agent takes as
given the sigma I

00:42:05.130 --> 00:42:09.090 align:middle line:84%
star of all the other
players less himself,

00:42:09.090 --> 00:42:11.520 align:middle line:84%
and then would in
principle, be looking

00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:16.380 align:middle line:84%
for a mixed strategy that might
do better than sigma I star.

00:42:16.380 --> 00:42:20.160 align:middle line:84%
But the mixed strategy
would be putting mass

00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:24.270 align:middle line:84%
on potential non-trivial
number of actions.

00:42:24.270 --> 00:42:27.540 align:middle line:84%
But if one action in
the mixed strategy

00:42:27.540 --> 00:42:30.750 align:middle line:84%
provides higher utility
than the other, then player

00:42:30.750 --> 00:42:32.460 align:middle line:84%
I would always
choose that action.

00:42:32.460 --> 00:42:36.600 align:middle line:84%
Why randomize over other things
that give you less utility?

00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:40.050 align:middle line:84%
So in fact, to try to guard
against alternatives that

00:42:40.050 --> 00:42:44.700 align:middle line:84%
do better, you only need to
evaluate over pure strategies,

00:42:44.700 --> 00:42:46.320 align:middle line:90%
not mixed strategies.

00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:49.470 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, the
definition is all on Nash

00:42:49.470 --> 00:42:54.030 align:middle line:84%
that sigma I star here is
going to weakly dominate

00:42:54.030 --> 00:42:59.160 align:middle line:84%
any other pure strategy SI
given that the other players are

00:42:59.160 --> 00:43:02.070 align:middle line:90%
doing sigma star minus I.

00:43:02.070 --> 00:43:05.490 align:middle line:84%
So that's the definition
and a proposition.

00:43:05.490 --> 00:43:08.010 align:middle line:84%
Now finally, we
get the dividend.

00:43:08.010 --> 00:43:13.200 align:middle line:84%
Every finite game has a mixed
strategy Nash equilibrium.

00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:15.570 align:middle line:90%
It's huge, hugely important.

00:43:15.570 --> 00:43:17.670 align:middle line:84%
And again, you could
write down a game.

00:43:17.670 --> 00:43:20.920 align:middle line:84%
But how do we know that it
even has Nash equilibrium?

00:43:20.920 --> 00:43:24.840 align:middle line:84%
Now we know that if it's a game
with a finite number of actions

00:43:24.840 --> 00:43:28.110 align:middle line:84%
for every player, it does
have a Nash equilibrium.

00:43:28.110 --> 00:43:30.540 align:middle line:84%
It may not be a pure
strategy equilibrium.

00:43:30.540 --> 00:43:32.820 align:middle line:90%
It may involve randomization.

00:43:32.820 --> 00:43:34.410 align:middle line:90%
But it exists.

00:43:34.410 --> 00:43:37.240 align:middle line:84%
And to come to the
fixed point part of it,

00:43:37.240 --> 00:43:40.740 align:middle line:84%
we're looking for this
profile sigma star

00:43:40.740 --> 00:43:44.670 align:middle line:84%
such that for every player
I, sigma I star weakly

00:43:44.670 --> 00:43:47.910 align:middle line:84%
dominates any other
strategy sigma I,

00:43:47.910 --> 00:43:50.670 align:middle line:84%
including pure
strategies, taking as

00:43:50.670 --> 00:43:52.600 align:middle line:84%
given what the other
players are doing.

00:43:52.600 --> 00:43:56.070 align:middle line:84%
In other words, if you start
with a sigma star, player

00:43:56.070 --> 00:44:00.510 align:middle line:84%
I would be reacting to what
the other players are doing

00:44:00.510 --> 00:44:03.510 align:middle line:84%
and choose the best
response given what

00:44:03.510 --> 00:44:04.920 align:middle line:90%
the other players are doing.

00:44:04.920 --> 00:44:09.420 align:middle line:84%
So indeed, this capital B
is the best response set.

00:44:09.420 --> 00:44:13.380 align:middle line:84%
There may be more than one
utility maximizing response.

00:44:13.380 --> 00:44:14.670 align:middle line:90%
If so, pick one.

00:44:14.670 --> 00:44:17.880 align:middle line:84%
It should be utility
maximizing per player I

00:44:17.880 --> 00:44:20.790 align:middle line:84%
given the configuration of
what everyone else is doing.

00:44:20.790 --> 00:44:25.080 align:middle line:84%
So now, we can talk about the
best response for player I,

00:44:25.080 --> 00:44:28.050 align:middle line:84%
taking as given what
other players are doing.

00:44:28.050 --> 00:44:31.110 align:middle line:84%
It's a bit tricky notation
here, because sigma I star

00:44:31.110 --> 00:44:32.610 align:middle line:90%
is what we want to find.

00:44:32.610 --> 00:44:36.720 align:middle line:84%
And this is the best
response given the strategies

00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:38.910 align:middle line:90%
of the others minus I.

00:44:38.910 --> 00:44:41.070 align:middle line:84%
And to be consistent
with the notation,

00:44:41.070 --> 00:44:43.330 align:middle line:90%
this B has a minus I on it.

00:44:43.330 --> 00:44:46.350 align:middle line:84%
But that does not mean that
these are the responses

00:44:46.350 --> 00:44:48.360 align:middle line:90%
of the other players j.

00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:51.720 align:middle line:84%
It is just a way of denoting
the best response for player

00:44:51.720 --> 00:44:54.510 align:middle line:84%
I conditioned on what all
the other guys are doing.

00:44:54.510 --> 00:44:56.850 align:middle line:84%
So minus I and
minus I both being

00:44:56.850 --> 00:44:58.130 align:middle line:90%
consistent with each other.

00:44:58.130 --> 00:44:59.910 align:middle line:84%
It's a bit weird in
terms of notation.

00:44:59.910 --> 00:45:03.090 align:middle line:84%
But so this B of
minus I-- minus I

00:45:03.090 --> 00:45:05.760 align:middle line:84%
means the best
response for player I.

00:45:05.760 --> 00:45:09.090 align:middle line:84%
We do that for all players
I and define it here.

00:45:09.090 --> 00:45:10.230 align:middle line:90%
This is BI.

00:45:10.230 --> 00:45:14.100 align:middle line:84%
Should have been a minus I.
I'll have to email Ashley.

00:45:14.100 --> 00:45:17.040 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, so we have
B of sigma to be

00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:20.310 align:middle line:84%
the configuration of
best responses for all

00:45:20.310 --> 00:45:21.450 align:middle line:90%
of the players.

00:45:21.450 --> 00:45:24.720 align:middle line:84%
And so we're looking
for a Nash equilibrium

00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:27.240 align:middle line:84%
to be a fixed point
of this mapping.

00:45:27.240 --> 00:45:30.180 align:middle line:84%
In particular, we
can find a sigma such

00:45:30.180 --> 00:45:33.060 align:middle line:84%
that given that sigma
for each player,

00:45:33.060 --> 00:45:35.670 align:middle line:84%
now knows what the other guys
are doing in the mixed strategy

00:45:35.670 --> 00:45:40.260 align:middle line:84%
sense, comes up with his or her
own best mixed strategy as part

00:45:40.260 --> 00:45:42.210 align:middle line:90%
of a best response.

00:45:42.210 --> 00:45:44.970 align:middle line:84%
Each player is doing
that and ends up

00:45:44.970 --> 00:45:48.780 align:middle line:84%
doing what they all took as
given to begin with-- namely,

00:45:48.780 --> 00:45:49.900 align:middle line:90%
sigma star.

00:45:49.900 --> 00:45:53.740 align:middle line:84%
So we just need this B thing
to have good properties.

00:45:53.740 --> 00:45:57.390 align:middle line:84%
And in particular,
this B thing turns out

00:45:57.390 --> 00:46:01.140 align:middle line:84%
to satisfy the conditions
of Kakutani's theorem.

00:46:01.140 --> 00:46:05.730 align:middle line:84%
It's operating over compact,
convex, nonempty sets.

00:46:05.730 --> 00:46:10.620 align:middle line:84%
Itself being nonempty, has a
convex value correspondence

00:46:10.620 --> 00:46:12.550 align:middle line:90%
and has a closed graph.

00:46:12.550 --> 00:46:16.290 align:middle line:84%
So then, we invoke
Kakutani and we're done.

00:46:16.290 --> 00:46:19.560 align:middle line:84%
So the second or third
illustration, now,

00:46:19.560 --> 00:46:21.780 align:middle line:84%
of Kakutani's
theorem, in this case,

00:46:21.780 --> 00:46:24.210 align:middle line:84%
to establish the existence
of a mixed strategy

00:46:24.210 --> 00:46:27.610 align:middle line:84%
Nash equilibrium
in a finite game--

00:46:27.610 --> 00:46:30.650 align:middle line:90%
are there questions?

00:46:30.650 --> 00:46:31.370 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:46:31.370 --> 00:46:37.800 align:middle line:84%
So let's apply this artillery to
US markets and talk about trade

00:46:37.800 --> 00:46:38.990 align:middle line:90%
fails.

00:46:38.990 --> 00:46:44.930 align:middle line:84%
So a trade fail is where
a buyer of a treasury

00:46:44.930 --> 00:46:49.400 align:middle line:84%
agrees to hand over
liquidity-- money,

00:46:49.400 --> 00:46:53.630 align:middle line:84%
excess reserves-- to the
seller, who has a treasury.

00:46:53.630 --> 00:46:56.780 align:middle line:84%
And likewise, the
other guy, the seller,

00:46:56.780 --> 00:47:01.380 align:middle line:84%
is happy to supply the treasury
in return for the liquidity.

00:47:01.380 --> 00:47:03.440 align:middle line:90%
So buyer and seller meet.

00:47:03.440 --> 00:47:05.450 align:middle line:84%
They meet in over
the counter market.

00:47:05.450 --> 00:47:08.270 align:middle line:84%
It's not a centralized
Walrasian market.

00:47:08.270 --> 00:47:12.100 align:middle line:84%
And then, they're supposed to
show up and settle the trade.

00:47:12.100 --> 00:47:14.990 align:middle line:84%
Well, technically, the
seller of the treasury

00:47:14.990 --> 00:47:17.150 align:middle line:84%
may not yet own the
treasury, but is

00:47:17.150 --> 00:47:19.980 align:middle line:84%
planning to get a hold of
it in one way or the other

00:47:19.980 --> 00:47:23.630 align:middle line:84%
so as to be able to pass
the treasury from him

00:47:23.630 --> 00:47:24.980 align:middle line:90%
or herself to the buyer.

00:47:24.980 --> 00:47:28.040 align:middle line:84%
And likewise, the
buyer may or may not

00:47:28.040 --> 00:47:30.650 align:middle line:84%
have liquidity at the
time they strike the deal,

00:47:30.650 --> 00:47:35.660 align:middle line:84%
but is planning, hopefully,
to get a hold of the liquidity

00:47:35.660 --> 00:47:39.410 align:middle line:84%
in order to be able to buy to
pay for what they've already

00:47:39.410 --> 00:47:40.580 align:middle line:90%
agreed to do.

00:47:40.580 --> 00:47:43.190 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't always
work out that way.

00:47:43.190 --> 00:47:46.370 align:middle line:84%
And there are settlement
fails in the system.

00:47:46.370 --> 00:47:49.940 align:middle line:84%
This happened, for example,
with a computer outage.

00:47:49.940 --> 00:47:52.730 align:middle line:84%
How can you settle trades
when it's all electronic

00:47:52.730 --> 00:47:55.490 align:middle line:84%
and there's nothing
on the screen?

00:47:55.490 --> 00:47:59.690 align:middle line:84%
9/11 was another problem where
there are a lot of disruptions.

00:47:59.690 --> 00:48:02.670 align:middle line:84%
Now, they all have backup
systems in New Jersey

00:48:02.670 --> 00:48:06.720 align:middle line:84%
and at Sanford, but
not at the time.

00:48:06.720 --> 00:48:09.740 align:middle line:84%
So as I said, the seller
may not have the securities.

00:48:09.740 --> 00:48:12.020 align:middle line:84%
One possibility is
that he was planning

00:48:12.020 --> 00:48:14.510 align:middle line:84%
to get them from someone
else, but that someone

00:48:14.510 --> 00:48:16.910 align:middle line:84%
else who was selling
the securities to him

00:48:16.910 --> 00:48:20.340 align:middle line:84%
for him to sell it to the
third party himself is failing.

00:48:20.340 --> 00:48:22.700 align:middle line:84%
So we get what we
call this daisy chain,

00:48:22.700 --> 00:48:25.470 align:middle line:90%
a cascade of failures.

00:48:25.470 --> 00:48:28.520 align:middle line:84%
So you really getting into
the weeds in terms of-- it's

00:48:28.520 --> 00:48:29.600 align:middle line:90%
not Walrasian.

00:48:29.600 --> 00:48:31.370 align:middle line:90%
It's not simple Nash.

00:48:31.370 --> 00:48:35.150 align:middle line:84%
It's a much more complicated
institutional arrangement.

00:48:35.150 --> 00:48:38.340 align:middle line:84%
But we're going to try to
use the Nash equilibrium.

00:48:38.340 --> 00:48:40.820 align:middle line:84%
Now, here's a picture
of the trade fails.

00:48:40.820 --> 00:48:44.240 align:middle line:84%
Although this was
between 1990 and 2014,

00:48:44.240 --> 00:48:49.040 align:middle line:84%
this paper from the New York Fed
is intended to be illustrative

00:48:49.040 --> 00:48:53.510 align:middle line:84%
of this surge of fails that
happened in the great financial

00:48:53.510 --> 00:48:58.530 align:middle line:90%
crisis of 2007, '07, '08.

00:48:58.530 --> 00:48:59.030 align:middle line:90%
So OK.

00:48:59.030 --> 00:48:59.730 align:middle line:90%
It's a spike.

00:48:59.730 --> 00:49:00.230 align:middle line:90%
So what?

00:49:00.230 --> 00:49:05.270 align:middle line:84%
We'll go over here,
say, higher than 9,000.

00:49:05.270 --> 00:49:06.500 align:middle line:90%
9,000 what?

00:49:06.500 --> 00:49:08.240 align:middle line:90%
9,000 billion.

00:49:08.240 --> 00:49:09.900 align:middle line:90%
We're talking trillions here.

00:49:09.900 --> 00:49:11.610 align:middle line:90%
This is unbelievable.

00:49:11.610 --> 00:49:12.110 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:49:12.110 --> 00:49:13.443 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't get bigger than this.

00:49:13.443 --> 00:49:16.640 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the treasury market
is the world's highest value

00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:18.980 align:middle line:90%
market in the whole world.

00:49:18.980 --> 00:49:21.830 align:middle line:84%
And now, we have a
substantial fraction

00:49:21.830 --> 00:49:24.950 align:middle line:84%
of trades that have been
agreed to as failing.

00:49:24.950 --> 00:49:27.740 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't able to
update this slide,

00:49:27.740 --> 00:49:34.250 align:middle line:84%
but I did see a paper just two
days ago, which is basically,

00:49:34.250 --> 00:49:35.720 align:middle line:90%
this year--

00:49:35.720 --> 00:49:40.070 align:middle line:84%
starting, say, January,
February, March--

00:49:40.070 --> 00:49:42.290 align:middle line:90%
in March, the virus hit.

00:49:42.290 --> 00:49:45.420 align:middle line:84%
And trade fails
just skyrocketed.

00:49:45.420 --> 00:49:50.180 align:middle line:84%
So the Fed had convinced itself
that having enough reserves

00:49:50.180 --> 00:49:53.210 align:middle line:84%
on its books would
provide ample liquidity

00:49:53.210 --> 00:49:56.030 align:middle line:84%
to the system sufficient
so that we would never

00:49:56.030 --> 00:49:58.250 align:middle line:90%
see trade sales again.

00:49:58.250 --> 00:50:00.190 align:middle line:90%
They got it wrong.

00:50:00.190 --> 00:50:01.940 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure how much
background you have.

00:50:01.940 --> 00:50:04.610 align:middle line:84%
But the Fed is
buying securities.

00:50:04.610 --> 00:50:07.070 align:middle line:84%
They're buying mortgage
backed securities

00:50:07.070 --> 00:50:08.720 align:middle line:90%
that other people wouldn't hold.

00:50:08.720 --> 00:50:12.260 align:middle line:84%
And for buying them, they
credit buyers, broker dealers,

00:50:12.260 --> 00:50:15.230 align:middle line:84%
and banks with accounts
at the Federal Reserve.

00:50:15.230 --> 00:50:17.270 align:middle line:84%
So those things are
called reserves.

00:50:17.270 --> 00:50:20.150 align:middle line:84%
They're well over
excess reserves.

00:50:20.150 --> 00:50:23.360 align:middle line:84%
That's where banks
keep excess value.

00:50:23.360 --> 00:50:26.240 align:middle line:84%
And they pay for stuff
with those reserves.

00:50:26.240 --> 00:50:27.980 align:middle line:84%
Banks don't borrow
from one another

00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:30.740 align:middle line:84%
very often anymore because
of all the excess reserves,

00:50:30.740 --> 00:50:31.800 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:50:31.800 --> 00:50:34.950 align:middle line:90%
But in March, it all fell apart.

00:50:34.950 --> 00:50:37.590 align:middle line:84%
And the Fed had to inject
even more liquidity.

00:50:37.590 --> 00:50:40.640 align:middle line:84%
So we're not quite ready
for monetary economics yet,

00:50:40.640 --> 00:50:43.130 align:middle line:84%
but we are ready to
talk about how to model

00:50:43.130 --> 00:50:44.880 align:middle line:90%
this market for securities.

00:50:44.880 --> 00:50:48.500 align:middle line:84%
So let's think
about it as a game,

00:50:48.500 --> 00:50:52.100 align:middle line:84%
a strategic game
played among traders.

00:50:52.100 --> 00:50:54.860 align:middle line:84%
So there's going to
be various goods,

00:50:54.860 --> 00:50:56.990 align:middle line:90%
like liquidity, treasuries.

00:50:56.990 --> 00:50:59.780 align:middle line:84%
We're back to our
usual notation here.

00:50:59.780 --> 00:51:03.770 align:middle line:84%
There are j goods, j equal
1 through not L, but k.

00:51:03.770 --> 00:51:05.750 align:middle line:84%
And there's going to
be a trading post--

00:51:05.750 --> 00:51:07.610 align:middle line:90%
a market, so to speak--

00:51:07.610 --> 00:51:09.290 align:middle line:90%
for each of the goods.

00:51:09.290 --> 00:51:13.910 align:middle line:84%
And they're going to buy
by paying unit of account

00:51:13.910 --> 00:51:16.310 align:middle line:84%
to get the good,
or sell the good,

00:51:16.310 --> 00:51:20.760 align:middle line:84%
and return get unit of
account into their accounts.

00:51:20.760 --> 00:51:26.520 align:middle line:84%
So agent I, trader
I, plays a strategy,

00:51:26.520 --> 00:51:30.380 align:middle line:90%
which has four objects.

00:51:30.380 --> 00:51:33.980 align:middle line:84%
Basically, can buy
or sell, but even

00:51:33.980 --> 00:51:37.160 align:middle line:84%
more than that, you
could buy and specify

00:51:37.160 --> 00:51:40.610 align:middle line:90%
a price pi for good j.

00:51:40.610 --> 00:51:43.850 align:middle line:84%
You're willing to
buy if the price is

00:51:43.850 --> 00:51:47.885 align:middle line:84%
less than or equal to that
price that you specified.

00:51:47.885 --> 00:51:49.010 align:middle line:90%
These are consumers, right?

00:51:49.010 --> 00:51:51.290 align:middle line:84%
So lower prices
are a good thing.

00:51:51.290 --> 00:51:54.920 align:middle line:84%
If you're willing to
buy at pi j for good j,

00:51:54.920 --> 00:51:57.800 align:middle line:84%
then you're willing to buy
if the price were less.

00:51:57.800 --> 00:52:00.050 align:middle line:90%
But you limit your exposure.

00:52:00.050 --> 00:52:03.050 align:middle line:84%
Regardless of whether
it's pi or less,

00:52:03.050 --> 00:52:05.630 align:middle line:84%
you're only going
to agree to buy

00:52:05.630 --> 00:52:07.880 align:middle line:90%
at most qij units of the goods.

00:52:07.880 --> 00:52:10.730 align:middle line:84%
So these are called
limit prices.

00:52:10.730 --> 00:52:13.490 align:middle line:84%
Then, that's the way the New
York Stock Exchange works,

00:52:13.490 --> 00:52:14.960 align:middle line:90%
et cetera.

00:52:14.960 --> 00:52:17.240 align:middle line:84%
Not all of the exchanges
work like this.

00:52:17.240 --> 00:52:20.810 align:middle line:84%
The tildes here denote
limit prices for sellers.

00:52:20.810 --> 00:52:27.200 align:middle line:84%
So a seller of good j will say,
well, I need a minimum price,

00:52:27.200 --> 00:52:29.570 align:middle line:90%
p tilde ij.

00:52:29.570 --> 00:52:31.040 align:middle line:84%
I'm willing to
sell at that price.

00:52:31.040 --> 00:52:33.110 align:middle line:84%
I'm willing to sell if
the price is higher,

00:52:33.110 --> 00:52:35.900 align:middle line:84%
but I'm not going to
sell an infinite amount.

00:52:35.900 --> 00:52:40.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to limit my
sales to q tilde ij.

00:52:40.370 --> 00:52:43.520 align:middle line:84%
So in this game,
all the traders are

00:52:43.520 --> 00:52:45.740 align:middle line:90%
submitting these limit orders.

00:52:45.740 --> 00:52:48.830 align:middle line:84%
And they effectively could
be on one side or the other,

00:52:48.830 --> 00:52:52.730 align:middle line:84%
or be willing to do both
depending on the prices

00:52:52.730 --> 00:52:53.960 align:middle line:90%
that they need.

00:52:53.960 --> 00:52:58.610 align:middle line:84%
So a strategy, S,
consists of the set

00:52:58.610 --> 00:53:02.360 align:middle line:84%
of possible actions, all these
configurations of vectors

00:53:02.360 --> 00:53:05.630 align:middle line:84%
for each of the
capital N players.

00:53:05.630 --> 00:53:08.690 align:middle line:84%
And then, we need to
denote the outcome.

00:53:08.690 --> 00:53:11.460 align:middle line:84%
The outcome function
is this function g--

00:53:11.460 --> 00:53:12.980 align:middle line:90%
we'll put it over here--

00:53:12.980 --> 00:53:18.110 align:middle line:84%
that if everyone is S, being S1,
S2, Sn for each of the players,

00:53:18.110 --> 00:53:21.830 align:middle line:84%
this vector S of
actions limit orders

00:53:21.830 --> 00:53:25.100 align:middle line:84%
submitted by all of
the end players maps

00:53:25.100 --> 00:53:28.100 align:middle line:84%
into a particular
outcome for player

00:53:28.100 --> 00:53:33.080 align:middle line:84%
I, trader I, which is
x, the excess demand

00:53:33.080 --> 00:53:36.330 align:middle line:90%
or supply, and beta.

00:53:36.330 --> 00:53:38.360 align:middle line:90%
And beta is a new object here.

00:53:38.360 --> 00:53:42.650 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be the net
credit that agent I receives

00:53:42.650 --> 00:53:47.270 align:middle line:84%
when strategy profile S
played by all the agents.

00:53:47.270 --> 00:53:50.780 align:middle line:84%
Beta is going to be the
total unit of account

00:53:50.780 --> 00:53:52.670 align:middle line:90%
an agent spends.

00:53:52.670 --> 00:53:55.940 align:middle line:84%
And if positive, if
positive, beta means

00:53:55.940 --> 00:53:59.572 align:middle line:84%
you spend less than what
you get as a seller.

00:53:59.572 --> 00:54:02.030 align:middle line:84%
You're a seller, you're getting
revenues in unit of account

00:54:02.030 --> 00:54:02.810 align:middle line:90%
from selling.

00:54:02.810 --> 00:54:05.720 align:middle line:84%
How much depends on what
everyone else put in.

00:54:05.720 --> 00:54:08.960 align:middle line:84%
If you're buying, then
you owe unit of account.

00:54:08.960 --> 00:54:11.870 align:middle line:84%
How much depends on what
everyone else is doing.

00:54:11.870 --> 00:54:16.370 align:middle line:84%
Beta could reflect the fact
that they sold more in value

00:54:16.370 --> 00:54:18.380 align:middle line:84%
in unit of account
than they demanded.

00:54:18.380 --> 00:54:20.460 align:middle line:84%
That would be a
good thing sort of.

00:54:20.460 --> 00:54:22.250 align:middle line:90%
They're just underspending.

00:54:22.250 --> 00:54:24.980 align:middle line:84%
The opposite is
a disaster, where

00:54:24.980 --> 00:54:28.610 align:middle line:84%
they've committed to spend unit
of account they don't have.

00:54:28.610 --> 00:54:30.830 align:middle line:90%
That's when beta goes negative.

00:54:30.830 --> 00:54:32.600 align:middle line:90%
That's a fail.

00:54:32.600 --> 00:54:34.580 align:middle line:90%
That's going to be a trade fail.

00:54:34.580 --> 00:54:37.260 align:middle line:84%
They can't come up
with the liquidity.

00:54:37.260 --> 00:54:41.730 align:middle line:84%
Or well, we want to prevent
that from happening.

00:54:41.730 --> 00:54:44.400 align:middle line:84%
By the way, here's the
simple-looking supply

00:54:44.400 --> 00:54:45.520 align:middle line:90%
and demand schedules.

00:54:45.520 --> 00:54:47.880 align:middle line:84%
These are consistent
with the limit orders.

00:54:47.880 --> 00:54:51.330 align:middle line:84%
For example, there's
a maximum price

00:54:51.330 --> 00:54:52.980 align:middle line:84%
that a household
is willing to pay.

00:54:52.980 --> 00:54:54.750 align:middle line:90%
We go over all the traders.

00:54:54.750 --> 00:54:57.630 align:middle line:84%
The max over the max
is the highest demand.

00:54:57.630 --> 00:54:59.580 align:middle line:84%
And as price starts
dropping, you'll

00:54:59.580 --> 00:55:02.770 align:middle line:84%
pick up a few other traders
who are willing to buy,

00:55:02.770 --> 00:55:05.290 align:middle line:84%
but they limited their
order in quantities.

00:55:05.290 --> 00:55:06.540 align:middle line:90%
And the price drops some more.

00:55:06.540 --> 00:55:08.700 align:middle line:90%
So you get these step functions.

00:55:08.700 --> 00:55:10.890 align:middle line:84%
And likewise, for
the suppliers, you

00:55:10.890 --> 00:55:12.240 align:middle line:90%
get a step function going up.

00:55:12.240 --> 00:55:13.740 align:middle line:84%
As the price gets
higher and higher,

00:55:13.740 --> 00:55:15.030 align:middle line:90%
you attract more sellers.

00:55:15.030 --> 00:55:17.170 align:middle line:84%
But they have all
submitted limit orders.

00:55:17.170 --> 00:55:19.500 align:middle line:84%
So we're looking
for this equilibrium

00:55:19.500 --> 00:55:21.240 align:middle line:84%
in this single
dimensional market.

00:55:21.240 --> 00:55:22.680 align:middle line:90%
There could be ties.

00:55:22.680 --> 00:55:24.000 align:middle line:90%
Supplies equal demand.

00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:28.140 align:middle line:84%
We have to have a way of
rationing or allocating the

00:55:28.140 --> 00:55:29.940 align:middle line:90%
whatever is short or long here.

00:55:29.940 --> 00:55:32.890 align:middle line:84%
In this case, there's
more demand than supply.

00:55:32.890 --> 00:55:37.050 align:middle line:84%
So we have to allocate
that across the demanders.

00:55:37.050 --> 00:55:39.910 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, these are meant
to be intuitive pictures.

00:55:39.910 --> 00:55:43.140 align:middle line:84%
So that's just
describing that picture.

00:55:43.140 --> 00:55:47.430 align:middle line:84%
Now, we want to make
sure there are no fails.

00:55:47.430 --> 00:55:50.650 align:middle line:90%
So we introduced this lambda.

00:55:50.650 --> 00:55:53.220 align:middle line:84%
So lambda is going to
be a penalty function.

00:55:53.220 --> 00:55:54.810 align:middle line:90%
And how does it work?

00:55:54.810 --> 00:55:59.100 align:middle line:84%
If beta is positive, then
under their strategies

00:55:59.100 --> 00:56:01.540 align:middle line:84%
and the strategies
of everyone else,

00:56:01.540 --> 00:56:04.170 align:middle line:84%
there's more revenue
than costs, in which

00:56:04.170 --> 00:56:05.670 align:middle line:90%
case, beta is positive.

00:56:05.670 --> 00:56:07.500 align:middle line:90%
Positive's higher than 0.

00:56:07.500 --> 00:56:08.880 align:middle line:90%
This whole term is 0.

00:56:08.880 --> 00:56:10.140 align:middle line:90%
There's no penalty.

00:56:10.140 --> 00:56:12.840 align:middle line:84%
But conversely, if
beta is negative

00:56:12.840 --> 00:56:15.090 align:middle line:84%
because their committed
net expenditure is higher

00:56:15.090 --> 00:56:18.300 align:middle line:84%
than their net revenue, then
the minimum of this function

00:56:18.300 --> 00:56:20.080 align:middle line:90%
is a negative number.

00:56:20.080 --> 00:56:22.270 align:middle line:90%
And it's amplified by lambda.

00:56:22.270 --> 00:56:24.480 align:middle line:90%
So lambda is the penalty cost.

00:56:24.480 --> 00:56:27.300 align:middle line:90%
It incurs if you overspend.

00:56:27.300 --> 00:56:30.150 align:middle line:84%
And of course,
ex-ante, they're going

00:56:30.150 --> 00:56:32.610 align:middle line:84%
to choose their strategies
given the strategies

00:56:32.610 --> 00:56:35.430 align:middle line:84%
that other people are
adopting in such ways

00:56:35.430 --> 00:56:39.240 align:middle line:84%
to maximize this total payoff,
not just the utility of getting

00:56:39.240 --> 00:56:43.980 align:middle line:84%
goods if they succeed in doing
that, but also the disutility

00:56:43.980 --> 00:56:46.020 align:middle line:90%
if they violate the budget.

00:56:46.020 --> 00:56:50.940 align:middle line:84%
So there's a curious
lemma here along the way

00:56:50.940 --> 00:56:54.510 align:middle line:90%
that the betas end up being 0.

00:56:54.510 --> 00:56:58.200 align:middle line:84%
In other words, in an
active Nash equilibrium,

00:56:58.200 --> 00:56:59.490 align:middle line:90%
everyone's on their budget.

00:56:59.490 --> 00:57:01.710 align:middle line:84%
Oh, yeah, like the
Walrasian thing, right?

00:57:01.710 --> 00:57:03.248 align:middle line:90%
That's what we're looking for.

00:57:03.248 --> 00:57:05.040 align:middle line:84%
We're going to try to
support the Walrasian

00:57:05.040 --> 00:57:07.620 align:middle line:90%
allocation momentarily.

00:57:07.620 --> 00:57:09.840 align:middle line:84%
But one thing-- not the
only thing which is true

00:57:09.840 --> 00:57:11.760 align:middle line:90%
of the Walrasian allocation--

00:57:11.760 --> 00:57:16.860 align:middle line:84%
is that excess demands
are 0 for each household.

00:57:16.860 --> 00:57:19.860 align:middle line:84%
The valuation of what is sold
is equal to the valuation

00:57:19.860 --> 00:57:21.940 align:middle line:90%
of what is demanded.

00:57:21.940 --> 00:57:23.490 align:middle line:90%
They're in their budget.

00:57:23.490 --> 00:57:24.540 align:middle line:90%
Data I is 0.

00:57:24.540 --> 00:57:26.550 align:middle line:84%
It turns out, the way
this game is being

00:57:26.550 --> 00:57:29.010 align:middle line:90%
defined, beta I must be 0.

00:57:29.010 --> 00:57:29.610 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:57:29.610 --> 00:57:32.100 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's deceptively simple.

00:57:32.100 --> 00:57:35.220 align:middle line:84%
Let's sum over the betas
of all the households.

00:57:35.220 --> 00:57:36.930 align:middle line:90%
That has to be 0.

00:57:36.930 --> 00:57:37.920 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:57:37.920 --> 00:57:40.080 align:middle line:84%
Because it's all
in unit of account

00:57:40.080 --> 00:57:43.680 align:middle line:84%
if whatever is
spent by me ends up

00:57:43.680 --> 00:57:46.770 align:middle line:84%
in the lap of whoever
sold me the goods.

00:57:46.770 --> 00:57:48.960 align:middle line:84%
So the unit of account
liquidity is just

00:57:48.960 --> 00:57:51.160 align:middle line:90%
passing around the system.

00:57:51.160 --> 00:57:55.090 align:middle line:84%
In other words, liquidity always
flows so that it's balanced.

00:57:55.090 --> 00:57:57.690 align:middle line:84%
So the sum of the
liquidity deficits

00:57:57.690 --> 00:58:00.930 align:middle line:84%
must be 0, because
someone always

00:58:00.930 --> 00:58:02.790 align:middle line:90%
ends up holding the liquidity.

00:58:02.790 --> 00:58:04.710 align:middle line:84%
And then, you could try
out what would happen

00:58:04.710 --> 00:58:07.650 align:middle line:90%
if some beta I were not 0.

00:58:07.650 --> 00:58:10.020 align:middle line:84%
Well, if this sum
is 0 and sum beta

00:58:10.020 --> 00:58:14.550 align:middle line:84%
I were positive, than if
there's a beta I which is not

00:58:14.550 --> 00:58:16.380 align:middle line:84%
0-- say, less than
0-- then there's

00:58:16.380 --> 00:58:20.070 align:middle line:84%
some other beta L which
is greater than 0.

00:58:20.070 --> 00:58:21.750 align:middle line:84%
Now, that trader
didn't spend all

00:58:21.750 --> 00:58:24.480 align:middle line:84%
of his unit of
account valuation.

00:58:24.480 --> 00:58:26.520 align:middle line:84%
So that couldn't
be maximal, given

00:58:26.520 --> 00:58:29.460 align:middle line:84%
the strategies all the
other players are adopting.

00:58:29.460 --> 00:58:32.580 align:middle line:90%
Player L would purchase more.

00:58:32.580 --> 00:58:34.380 align:middle line:90%
So the betas have to be 0.

00:58:34.380 --> 00:58:39.840 align:middle line:84%
And the final slide here
is, how do we choose lambda?

00:58:39.840 --> 00:58:43.770 align:middle line:84%
Or alternatively, given a
competitive equilibrium,

00:58:43.770 --> 00:58:46.560 align:middle line:84%
how do we find the
corresponding Nash equilibrium

00:58:46.560 --> 00:58:48.510 align:middle line:90%
in this game that achieves it?

00:58:48.510 --> 00:58:51.480 align:middle line:84%
But we're given the
prices and allocations

00:58:51.480 --> 00:58:53.500 align:middle line:90%
of the competitive equilibrium.

00:58:53.500 --> 00:58:56.370 align:middle line:84%
And in a competitive
equilibrium, each trader's

00:58:56.370 --> 00:59:00.510 align:middle line:84%
maximizing utility subject to
budget defined by those given

00:59:00.510 --> 00:59:03.240 align:middle line:90%
prices, vector p.

00:59:03.240 --> 00:59:07.030 align:middle line:84%
That will define the marginal
utility of income, mu,

00:59:07.030 --> 00:59:11.960 align:middle line:84%
which coincidentally is exactly
what we called it on Tuesday--

00:59:11.960 --> 00:59:16.280 align:middle line:84%
mu I, the marginal utility
of income of trader I, OK?

00:59:16.280 --> 00:59:21.590 align:middle line:84%
So what we want is to choose
these penalties high enough

00:59:21.590 --> 00:59:24.980 align:middle line:84%
so that the penalty is higher
than the marginal utility

00:59:24.980 --> 00:59:26.630 align:middle line:90%
of income.

00:59:26.630 --> 00:59:29.470 align:middle line:84%
So mu I is the marginal
utility of income.

00:59:29.470 --> 00:59:31.510 align:middle line:84%
We're going to scale
it by something

00:59:31.510 --> 00:59:36.230 align:middle line:84%
called alpha in such a way
that we get this inequality.

00:59:36.230 --> 00:59:39.880 align:middle line:84%
So you contemplate not
honoring the trade.

00:59:39.880 --> 00:59:43.090 align:middle line:84%
That's going to be associated
with this penalty cost lambda.

00:59:43.090 --> 00:59:45.790 align:middle line:84%
And that's greater than the
margin utility of income.

00:59:45.790 --> 00:59:47.680 align:middle line:84%
You should have
avoided that situation

00:59:47.680 --> 00:59:50.590 align:middle line:90%
by not going over your budget.

00:59:50.590 --> 00:59:54.550 align:middle line:84%
And so given the alpha, we
can redefine the limit prices

00:59:54.550 --> 00:59:56.890 align:middle line:84%
and the limit
quantities in a way

00:59:56.890 --> 00:59:59.810 align:middle line:84%
as to achieve a
Walrasian equilibrium.

00:59:59.810 --> 01:00:03.550 align:middle line:84%
So we've actually defined
Walrasian equilibrium, Nash

01:00:03.550 --> 01:00:07.630 align:middle line:84%
equilibrium, defined a game here
in a market that potentially

01:00:07.630 --> 01:00:08.440 align:middle line:90%
has a problem.

01:00:08.440 --> 01:00:11.110 align:middle line:84%
Evidently, the penalties
are not high enough.

01:00:11.110 --> 01:00:14.050 align:middle line:84%
If we follow this
model, there's a way

01:00:14.050 --> 01:00:17.890 align:middle line:84%
to implement penalties to avoid
trade fails so that the Nash

01:00:17.890 --> 01:00:20.050 align:middle line:84%
equilibria of that
institutional setup

01:00:20.050 --> 01:00:24.040 align:middle line:84%
would correspond with the
Walrasian equilibrium.

01:00:24.040 --> 01:00:28.320 align:middle line:84%
OK, so thank you
for coming today.

01:00:28.320 --> 01:00:35.000 align:middle line:90%

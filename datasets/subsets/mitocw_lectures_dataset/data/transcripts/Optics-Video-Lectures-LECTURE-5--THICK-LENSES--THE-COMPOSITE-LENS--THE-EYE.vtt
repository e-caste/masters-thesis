00:00:21.348 --> 00:00:22.390
SE BAEK OH: Good morning.

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:24.830
My name's Se Baek, and
I'm a postdoc working

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:26.350
with Professor Barbastathis.

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:30.910
And he has a personal emergency
today, so he couldn't make it.

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:34.510
So actually Pepe and I
will give a lecture today.

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:39.550
And just for a reminder, you
can turn in your first homework

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.500
today before class
or after class.

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.950
OK, so yesterday, we talk about
a bunch of different things.

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:57.100
The first one we derived--

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.530
by the way, excuse
me, we are going

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.360
to do the same
thing, same format.

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.580
So if you have any
questions, just feel free

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.690
to interrupt and
ask questions, OK?

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:17.480
So the last time,
we actually derived

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:21.400
the ray transfer matrix
for a thin lens, which

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.760
is the spherical lens has
two curvatures, the first one

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:30.850
and second one, which is here,
the 1 and negative 1 over f. f

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:32.710
is focal length and 1, 0.

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.210
And the focal length
1 over f, this

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.100
actually we derived
this equation,

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.470
the [INAUDIBLE] equation.

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:43.720
So if you know the reflective
index and the radius curvature,

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.490
the left side and
right side, then you

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:50.560
can just easily compute the
focal length of your thin lens.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.660
Then, also, we talked about
the object at infinity

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:57.770
and the image at infinity.

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.760
So for example, in this case,
we have the object at infinity.

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:06.010
So we have this ray is
coming from the infinity.

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:10.900
And we are going to have the
focus point at the focal plane.

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:14.380
That's the definition of the
focal length and focal plane.

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.820
And the other way, if we had
the point object at focal plane,

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.350
then we are going to have
an image at infinity.

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:26.630
So that's the same thing.

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.350
And if you have the
negative length, I mean,

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.750
the focal length is negative,
then we have the same thing.

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.470
We have parallel coming in.

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.180
In this case, it bent outside.

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.330
But if you extract
and extend, then we

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:45.020
have the focal point here.

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.730
So as you know the object
and image they are conjugate.

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.210
And in this case, [INAUDIBLE]
object or image is at infinity.

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:56.380
So we call it, I mean
this configuration,

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.362
as infinite conjugate.

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.235
[INAUDIBLE], please.

00:03:07.235 --> 00:03:07.735
Yeah.

00:03:10.585 --> 00:03:15.920
Because, you know, one
of them is at infinity.

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.100
So yeah, that's what we
talked about yesterday.

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:22.730
And today, we're
going to be talking

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:24.750
about interesting topic.

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:30.640
So what if we have our object or
an image is at finite distance?

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.240
It's more realistic case.

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:35.180
Just like when you take
a picture of your person,

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.630
I mean, of a friend,
then your friend is not

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:40.890
going to be at infinity, right?

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:43.200
So it's more realistic case.

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.620
And then we'll talk
about thick lens.

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:51.320
Because so far, we just assume
our lens is infinitely thin.

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:54.800
So thick lens is more
like the realistic case.

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:59.720
And then the paper we'll talk
about is human visual system.

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:08.810
So I guess this
slide is probably

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:12.430
one of the most important
slides of this whole course.

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:16.550
Because, you know, we are
dealing with the object

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:18.380
and image at finite distance.

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:19.769
So the situation is like this.

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:24.320
We have a lens with focal
length F. And in object space,

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:29.300
we are given our object
as some distance.

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:30.890
You know, the
situation's like this.

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:31.940
You have a camera.

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:33.850
And you take a
picture of a person.

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:40.070
Then where should I put
my screen or detector?

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:44.120
Or in the other
way around, there

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:47.640
must be some condition that
makes the perfect image, right?

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:50.600
So if you take a picture
at some distance,

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:55.700
then the other object which
is not at that distance

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:58.220
will look blurry in
your final image, right?

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:03.980
So we are going to find what
condition should be satisfied

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:08.390
here in terms of the distance
in object space and focal length

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:10.670
and distancing image space.

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:15.950
And we're going to see what
kind of image we will get

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:19.170
or how big it is, OK?

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:24.540
So the first one
is, what is image.

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:26.430
So what it image?

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:30.390
So image is just replicate
of an object, right?

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:33.960
So in terms of this
ray picture, we

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:38.070
have infinite number of rays--

00:05:40.709 --> 00:05:57.990
oh, sorry-- emanating
from the object point.

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:02.330
And if this configuration is
an image configuration, which

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:06.210
means you make a perfect image,
then all these rays, at least

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:08.400
most of them, they
should be converge

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:11.507
at a point in object
space somewhere, right?

00:06:11.507 --> 00:06:12.840
So that's the image in question.

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:15.540
You have bunch of ray
coming from this point,

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:19.810
and they should
meet at one point.

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:25.060
So you can draw many, many
ways, but of your choice

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:37.520
is just two rays here, this
first ray and the second way.

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:41.900
And since every ray should meet
at one point in image space,

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:45.890
these two ways also should
meet at the same point.

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:50.060
And the reason why we chose only
two rays is kind of obvious,

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:53.390
because we know the infinite
conjugate configuration, right?

00:06:53.390 --> 00:07:01.840
So the first ray, the
upper ray here, this ray,

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:04.890
it looks like coming from the
object at infinity, right?

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:06.770
It's parallel to
the optical axis.

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:14.410
So after the lens, it should
pass the focal point like this.

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:17.960
And we call this point
as back focal plane,

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:21.610
since it is behind the lens.

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:23.730
And what about the
second ray here?

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:32.890
So if you choose, that ray is
passing through the focal point

00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:35.850
which is in front of the lens,
we call the front focal plane,

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:42.550
then at the lens it looks like
coming from the focal point,

00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:43.050
right?

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:47.110
So it should be going
to the infinity.

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:50.920
So it's collimated and
parallel to the optical axis.

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:54.860
And these two rays
meet at this point.

00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:59.150
So that point is where
you get the image.

00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:02.990
And the other rays, the
infinite number rays,

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:05.930
should meet at that point.

00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:11.120
So this is how we draw
the configuration image.

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:16.220
So we have bunch of ray and
bunch of ray in image space.

00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:19.165
Any questions so far?

00:08:19.165 --> 00:08:19.665
OK.

00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:32.809
So to find the relation between
the object distance and image

00:08:32.809 --> 00:08:36.390
distance, let's define
two distance here.

00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:40.039
So first one is x0, the
distance from the object

00:08:40.039 --> 00:08:41.970
to the front focal plane.

00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:46.160
And this second one is xi,
so from that focal point

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:47.040
to the image.

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:52.040
So we are going to see how
they relate to the focal length

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:52.920
here.

00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:58.670
So first thing is we can compare
it to a big triangle here.

00:08:58.670 --> 00:09:02.886
So the first one is--

00:09:02.886 --> 00:09:13.400
oops-- this triangle
OPFf and this one, BCFf.

00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:26.210
Since they are similar, so
if you see this height of PO

00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:30.900
and this BC is same as h--

00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:37.830
actually, they are h object
over xo, so ho and xo.

00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:42.370
And it should be
same as negative h i.

00:09:42.370 --> 00:09:44.670
The negative sign is
because h i is negative.

00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:46.080
So to make the
positive, you have

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:48.680
to put the negative sign here.

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:50.340
And this [INAUDIBLE], right?

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:53.250
So you get this first relation.

00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:58.260
And you can compare
the other triangles

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:09.540
at image space, so this
ACFb and IQF, this one.

00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:13.970
So if you do the same thing,
then we have this relation.

00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:22.730
So QI, which is the image
height, and FPQ, this is xi.

00:10:22.730 --> 00:10:28.430
And we have the h, the object
height, over focal length.

00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:33.270
So we have this relation
and the second relation.

00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:36.950
So if you combine them, we have
two interesting equation here.

00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:40.100
The first one is h,
the image of height,

00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:47.530
over x, or the object height, is
xi over h or equal to negative

00:10:47.530 --> 00:10:49.640
f over xo.

00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:53.060
And it's also same as
negative xi over f.

00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:55.040
Can anyone guess
what this quantity

00:10:55.040 --> 00:11:05.480
means, So h i over ho, so
image height or object height?

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:05.980
Yes.

00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:06.920
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:08.045
SE BAEK OH: Right, exactly.

00:11:08.045 --> 00:11:10.400
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:14.846 --> 00:11:17.330
SE BAEK OH: Yeah, for
he said magnification.

00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:17.830
Yeah.

00:11:17.830 --> 00:11:19.460
Course, you know,
this is a ratio

00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:22.730
of the size of the
image and object.

00:11:22.730 --> 00:11:26.750
So actually, this term
indicate the magnification

00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:29.120
of your imaging system, right?

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:38.550
So magnification actually
is defined by this, just h i

00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:40.170
over ho.

00:11:40.170 --> 00:11:45.120
If the absolute value of
magnification is larger than 1,

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:48.060
then you're going to
get the magnified image.

00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:51.030
Course, the image height is
bigger than object height,

00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:51.540
right?

00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:53.310
And if it is smaller
than 1, we are

00:11:53.310 --> 00:11:57.830
going to get the
smaller image, right?

00:11:57.830 --> 00:12:01.160
And if you combine the
rest, these two equations,

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:06.080
so f over x and
xo and xi over f,

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:09.590
then you can get this equation.

00:12:09.590 --> 00:12:14.180
xo times xi should be f squared.

00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:17.380
So xo is this distance, so
object to the focal plane,

00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:18.740
the front focal plane.

00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:22.350
And xi is from that focal
point to the image plane.

00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:27.827
So this tells you where
should you put the detector

00:12:27.827 --> 00:12:29.660
or object to make an
image condition, right?

00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:32.320
So they are related like this.

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:37.850
So this is one of the form
of the imaging condition.

00:12:37.850 --> 00:12:39.962
And we it Newton's form, OK?

00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:47.620
And sometimes it is more
convenient to define

00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:51.080
the distance from object to
the lens, not the focal plane.

00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:54.490
So we define two other
distance, so s o, object

00:12:54.490 --> 00:12:59.500
distant from object to the
lens, and image distance, si,

00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:01.780
from lens to image.

00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:05.120
And actually in this
picture in this figure,

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:11.890
we can draw another way, which
is from object to the image.

00:13:11.890 --> 00:13:14.590
But it passed through
the center of the lens,

00:13:14.590 --> 00:13:19.170
and it looks like just a path
straight through the lens.

00:13:19.170 --> 00:13:20.880
And can anyone guess why?

00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:31.430
Because at the center of the
lens, at the very center,

00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:34.520
the radius curvature is
kind of infinite, right?

00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:39.450
So it just looks like
just piece of flat glass.

00:13:39.450 --> 00:13:41.630
So if you have this
piece of glass,

00:13:41.630 --> 00:13:44.130
then you know from
the [INAUDIBLE] law

00:13:44.130 --> 00:13:46.540
the incident ray and
the outgoing ray,

00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:50.150
they are parallel, right, if
you have the same median here

00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:51.650
and here.

00:13:51.650 --> 00:13:54.990
And also, we are talking
about the very thin lens here.

00:13:54.990 --> 00:13:59.360
So we don't really consider
the thickness of the lens.

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:05.750
So that's why it looks
like just passing straight

00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:06.610
through the lens.

00:14:06.610 --> 00:14:09.980
So you can draw actually
three rays here, so

00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:18.810
the first one, this one,
and this one, and this one.

00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:25.640
And then you can
compare two, actually,

00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:40.860
another big triangles, so OCA
this one, and IQC, this one.

00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:43.940
So if you compare that triangle,
then we're going to get--

00:14:47.230 --> 00:14:52.370
so CA over CB, so CA
[INAUDIBLE] CB, which

00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:57.410
is the, actually, magnification
here, ho over negative h i

00:14:57.410 --> 00:15:03.920
should be same as this object
distance and image distance.

00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:08.010
So this tells you, if you have
the object distance and image

00:15:08.010 --> 00:15:10.010
distance, they are related
to the magnification.

00:15:10.010 --> 00:15:14.420
So if your object is very
far away from the lens,

00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:17.150
then you're going to get
very small image, right?

00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:19.730
Because you have [INAUDIBLE].

00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:22.082
So you have the
very big one here,

00:15:22.082 --> 00:15:23.540
so you're going to
get a small one.

00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:26.180
But if you move your
object to the lens,

00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:28.400
then there are big change.

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:31.310
You're going to get the
magnified one, magnified image.

00:15:34.930 --> 00:15:39.460
And if you combine this
equation and this relation

00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:43.930
and these two, then we are
going to have the si over s o.

00:15:43.930 --> 00:15:48.160
And it's the same as f over xo.

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:55.670
So xo is actually s o minus
f, right, so s o minus f.

00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:58.230
Yeah, let me do the
[INAUDIBLE],, please.

00:15:58.230 --> 00:16:01.690
So let me rewrite that equation.

00:16:01.690 --> 00:16:05.480
I just flip the numerator
and denominator.

00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:13.780
So s o over si is same
as s o minus f and f.

00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:17.380
And it should be
same as s o over f.

00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:19.430
And it's minus 1, right?

00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:22.830
And I divide by s o here.

00:16:22.830 --> 00:16:26.972
So I get 1 over si
should be 1 over f--

00:16:26.972 --> 00:16:28.847
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
s i or [INAUDIBLE] s o,

00:16:28.847 --> 00:16:32.840
or so over [INAUDIBLE]?

00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:36.130
SE BAEK OH: No, I just flipped
the numerator, denominator.

00:16:36.130 --> 00:16:44.450
So it was si over s o,
but I wrote s o over si.

00:16:44.450 --> 00:16:48.370
So this one also flips,
right, s o minus f over f.

00:16:54.840 --> 00:17:04.339
And I end up with 1 over si
equal to 1 over f minus 1

00:17:04.339 --> 00:17:14.020
over s o, which is
the final equation.

00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:15.460
So we call this the lens law.

00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:18.849
So 1 over object distance
versus 1 over image distance

00:17:18.849 --> 00:17:20.410
should be 1 over f.

00:17:20.410 --> 00:17:22.859
So, yeah.

00:17:22.859 --> 00:17:26.670
So actually, that's the
equation in most of time

00:17:26.670 --> 00:17:27.810
we are going to use.

00:17:32.301 --> 00:17:36.320
OK, so we just
finished probably one

00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:38.240
of the most important slides.

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:39.250
Any questions?

00:17:44.250 --> 00:17:46.590
So by using this
equation, we can

00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:49.512
analyze different situation.

00:17:49.512 --> 00:17:51.720
So let's first see the four
different situation here.

00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:54.810
We have positive lens
and negative lens.

00:17:54.810 --> 00:17:59.550
And the upper left situation
is what we just described.

00:17:59.550 --> 00:18:03.130
So the object distance is
longer than front focal length.

00:18:03.130 --> 00:18:05.950
So you draw the two rays,
the upper one and right one.

00:18:05.950 --> 00:18:08.490
And you just trace them,
and they meet at one point.

00:18:08.490 --> 00:18:10.590
And you're going
to get the image.

00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:12.300
And we call this
one as real image,

00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:18.210
because all this ray MRI
is departing at that point.

00:18:18.210 --> 00:18:20.680
They actually meet
at this point.

00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:23.010
So if you put a
screen there, then you

00:18:23.010 --> 00:18:25.630
can actually see those
image of the object.

00:18:25.630 --> 00:18:27.570
So that's why we
call the real image.

00:18:27.570 --> 00:18:29.130
And it's inverted, right?

00:18:29.130 --> 00:18:31.160
Because it was going up right.

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:34.130
It's down right.

00:18:34.130 --> 00:18:37.750
And magnification
is definitely small.

00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:40.460
It's negative, because inverted.

00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:45.500
And also, if you see the
distance, object distance,

00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:48.470
this one and this one,
then you can easily

00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:49.790
see you're going to have--

00:18:53.730 --> 00:18:57.300
actually, it depends on the
object distance, but yeah.

00:18:57.300 --> 00:19:00.720
And in terms of
equation, so this s o

00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:03.240
is bigger than
focal length, right?

00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:09.040
So this 1 over s o is actually
smaller than 1 over f.

00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:12.835
So si should be positive.

00:19:12.835 --> 00:19:14.210
You need to add
something, right?

00:19:14.210 --> 00:19:16.770
Because this one is
smaller than this one.

00:19:16.770 --> 00:19:18.800
So that's why we
have the si, which

00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:21.690
is positive distance here.

00:19:21.690 --> 00:19:24.080
But if you think
about this situation,

00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:28.180
so object distance now is
smaller than focal length.

00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:31.610
It's closer than the
front focal plane.

00:19:31.610 --> 00:19:36.580
Then you can still
draw these two rays.

00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:42.300
One is parallel to
the optical axis.

00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:45.890
And the other one is passing
through the front focal plane.

00:19:45.890 --> 00:19:47.600
But after the
lens, actually they

00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:50.660
don't meet, because
they are diverging.

00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:54.140
So if you back trace,
then they actually

00:19:54.140 --> 00:19:56.570
meet in front of the lens.

00:19:56.570 --> 00:20:00.050
So we call this as
a virtual image,

00:20:00.050 --> 00:20:03.390
because it looks like
coming from that point.

00:20:03.390 --> 00:20:05.380
But if you put a
screen there, the--

00:20:08.026 --> 00:20:08.970
just a second.

00:20:08.970 --> 00:20:12.010
So [INAUDIBLE],, I'm not using
the [INAUDIBLE] right now.

00:20:12.010 --> 00:20:15.600
So OK, thanks.

00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:20.300
So if you put the screen
there, then you don't really

00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:21.520
see the actual image.

00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:26.250
It just looks like these
two rays behind the lens,

00:20:26.250 --> 00:20:28.510
they look coming
from this point.

00:20:28.510 --> 00:20:31.340
So that's the definition
of the virtual image.

00:20:31.340 --> 00:20:35.200
And as you can see here,
we have the erect image.

00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:37.280
And it's bigger than
the original object,

00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:38.330
which is green.

00:20:38.330 --> 00:20:41.570
So magnification
is bigger than 1.

00:20:41.570 --> 00:20:46.280
In terms of the equation, so
now s o is smaller than f.

00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:50.500
So 1 over s o is actually
bigger than 1 over f, right?

00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:53.160
So actually this guy
should be negative,

00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:57.200
which means si also
should be negative,

00:20:57.200 --> 00:21:00.590
which indicate your image
distance is negative.

00:21:00.590 --> 00:21:03.330
So you are going to have the
image in front of your lens,

00:21:03.330 --> 00:21:03.830
right?

00:21:07.050 --> 00:21:12.010
And the negative lens, we have
the negative focal length here.

00:21:12.010 --> 00:21:14.160
So that's why the front
focal plane is actually

00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:16.830
behind the lens, not
in front of the lens.

00:21:16.830 --> 00:21:21.150
So you can still draw these
two rays, but they don't meet.

00:21:21.150 --> 00:21:24.000
They make a virtual image
in front of the lens.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:28.890
And we have the virtual and
erect image and magnification.

00:21:28.890 --> 00:21:31.080
We get actually
the smaller image.

00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:33.240
And if you do the
same thing here,

00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:34.890
we are going to get
the virtual, erect.

00:21:34.890 --> 00:21:37.550
And it's also smaller image.

00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:47.370
OK, so, so far, we just
talk about the thin lens

00:21:47.370 --> 00:21:51.010
and how they make the image--

00:21:51.010 --> 00:21:56.490
sorry, Pepe will pass
around the convex lens,

00:21:56.490 --> 00:22:01.190
which was the upper case.

00:22:01.190 --> 00:22:04.060
So if you move your
screen or eyes,

00:22:04.060 --> 00:22:07.520
then you can see actually it
was inverted, but it's erect.

00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:10.660
So you have to see the
flipped image, right?

00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:12.380
So he's going to pass around.

00:22:12.380 --> 00:22:16.050
GUEST SPEAKER: So one way to
do it is just look at the lens,

00:22:16.050 --> 00:22:19.410
look at your notebook.

00:22:19.410 --> 00:22:22.630
And you can have it just
at the right distance,

00:22:22.630 --> 00:22:25.870
the image would look
inverted and floating

00:22:25.870 --> 00:22:29.290
on top of the lens,
which is the real image.

00:22:29.290 --> 00:22:31.510
And if you put it closer,
which means that now we

00:22:31.510 --> 00:22:33.400
have the second case
there, the image

00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:36.540
will be erect, so
not inverted anymore,

00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:38.860
and would look behind
the lens, right?

00:22:38.860 --> 00:22:41.205
So it's actually pretty
dramatic, the change.

00:22:41.205 --> 00:22:41.920
SE BAEK OH: Yeah.

00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:45.730
Actually, the upper right
configuration is the exact same

00:22:45.730 --> 00:22:46.850
from as magnifier.

00:22:46.850 --> 00:22:51.820
So you know, magnifier
that detective are using?

00:22:58.650 --> 00:23:02.280
Yeah, So the next question is,
what if we have multiple lenses

00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:03.930
like this, this case?

00:23:03.930 --> 00:23:06.750
So here we have two lenses.

00:23:06.750 --> 00:23:08.830
Each one has a
focal length of 10.

00:23:08.830 --> 00:23:10.590
So let's say unit
is a millimeter.

00:23:10.590 --> 00:23:14.190
So the focal length, is just
10 millimeter, 10 millimeter.

00:23:14.190 --> 00:23:16.740
And the gap between the
lens is 5 millimeter.

00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:19.650
And we are given
an object, which

00:23:19.650 --> 00:23:23.490
is the distance from the object
to the first lens is just 5

00:23:23.490 --> 00:23:24.380
millimeter.

00:23:24.380 --> 00:23:28.470
And we want to find what
kind of image we get

00:23:28.470 --> 00:23:33.220
and where it is at
somewhere around here.

00:23:33.220 --> 00:23:36.590
So can anyone
guess how to do it?

00:23:36.590 --> 00:23:39.690
Because we just talk
about a single lens,

00:23:39.690 --> 00:23:41.590
but what if we have
the multiple lens?

00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:52.815
No one?

00:23:52.815 --> 00:23:55.930
So actually the answer is
pretty straightforward.

00:23:55.930 --> 00:23:59.160
So you just cascade, which
means your first [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:00.030
the first lens.

00:24:00.030 --> 00:24:02.910
So you just find the
image of the object

00:24:02.910 --> 00:24:04.080
through the first lens.

00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:08.880
And that image becomes the
object to the second lens.

00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:11.680
And do the same thing
to find the image.

00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:13.380
And if you have
more lens, you just

00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:15.330
repeat the same process, OK?

00:24:15.330 --> 00:24:17.790
So let's first try it.

00:24:17.790 --> 00:24:22.080
So here I just neglect
the second lens.

00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:25.603
I only have the first lens,
which has the object distance 5

00:24:25.603 --> 00:24:26.860
millimeter.

00:24:26.860 --> 00:24:28.390
And the focal length is 10.

00:24:28.390 --> 00:24:32.220
So I can draw the two or
three rays to find the image.

00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:36.220
But to be precise, I
just plug into equation.

00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:39.120
So 1 over 5, which
is this distance,

00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:41.715
the 5 is this distance.

00:24:41.715 --> 00:24:44.650
We want to find
the image distance.

00:24:44.650 --> 00:24:47.490
If it is positive, then we
are going to get real image.

00:24:47.490 --> 00:24:49.210
But if it is negative,
then we are going

00:24:49.210 --> 00:24:51.090
to get the virtual image here.

00:24:51.090 --> 00:24:52.980
And it should be
1 over 10, which

00:24:52.980 --> 00:24:54.530
is the focal length, right?

00:24:54.530 --> 00:24:58.140
And it turns out that this s
prime, this image distance, is

00:24:58.140 --> 00:25:04.210
actually negative
10, which means

00:25:04.210 --> 00:25:08.050
we have the negative image,
which is in front of the lens.

00:25:08.050 --> 00:25:10.060
This distance is 10 millimeter.

00:25:10.060 --> 00:25:13.400
And if you compare the
magnification, which

00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:16.600
is defined by the object
distance and image distance,

00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:19.070
so it's negative, there
is a negative side.

00:25:19.070 --> 00:25:23.680
So negative, negative, negative
10 over 5 is actually 2.

00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:28.990
So we have a erect
virtual image which

00:25:28.990 --> 00:25:31.410
is twice larger
than original image.

00:25:31.410 --> 00:25:34.240
This is the first lens.

00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:39.580
And this image is now an
object to the second lens.

00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:42.840
So we had the
virtual image here,

00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:46.250
which was the 10 millimeter
in front of the lens.

00:25:46.250 --> 00:25:48.040
But if you only think
about second lens,

00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:52.600
then this object distance
should be 15 millimeter, right?

00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:53.950
So if you do the same thing.

00:25:57.100 --> 00:26:00.860
so now we have the 1 over
15 from here to here.

00:26:00.860 --> 00:26:04.300
And we want to find
the image distance.

00:26:04.300 --> 00:26:09.540
1 over s prime
should be 1 over 10,

00:26:09.540 --> 00:26:18.070
which is just positive
30 millimeter.

00:26:18.070 --> 00:26:22.110
So after 30 millimeter, we are
going to have the real image.

00:26:22.110 --> 00:26:24.000
And if you compare
the magnification

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:27.880
of the second lens, then
it's negative 30 over 15.

00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:29.400
So we have the negative 2.

00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:35.340
So we have the real image
here, which is inverted one.

00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:37.840
And that is twice larger
than this virtual--

00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:39.570
I mean, the object
of the second image.

00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:47.670
Because, actually, we initially
had two lens like this.

00:26:47.670 --> 00:26:50.790
So the overall magnification
is just multiplication

00:26:50.790 --> 00:26:52.380
of individual magnification.

00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:55.530
So first one was positive 2.

00:26:55.530 --> 00:26:56.820
And this is negative 2.

00:26:56.820 --> 00:27:00.000
So the final
magnification is minus 4.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:04.490
So the answer to
the question is we

00:27:04.490 --> 00:27:08.550
are going to have the
inverted real image

00:27:08.550 --> 00:27:11.800
behind the second
lens, which is 30

00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:13.760
millimeter behind
the second lens,

00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:17.970
and which is 4 times larger
than the original object.

00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:24.150
So if you have fewer
lens, like 2 or 3,

00:27:24.150 --> 00:27:26.440
then this approach is pretty
straightforward, right?

00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:28.140
We just consider one by one.

00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:30.450
And just apply the
lens law, and you're

00:27:30.450 --> 00:27:32.010
going to get the right answer.

00:27:38.497 --> 00:27:40.500
OK.

00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:44.120
So the previous
slide we just derived

00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:48.080
the imaging condition,
which was the xo times xi

00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:53.450
should be x squared or 1 over
s o plus 1 over si is 1 over f.

00:27:53.450 --> 00:27:57.260
We just derived those equations
from the geometry, right?

00:27:57.260 --> 00:27:59.540
We just compared
the few triangles

00:27:59.540 --> 00:28:03.590
and get the final equations.

00:28:03.590 --> 00:28:07.640
Well, I can do the same thing
with the ray matrix transform.

00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:11.600
So let me do
[INAUDIBLE],, please.

00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:24.690
So the way you do it, in
the ray transfer matrix,

00:28:24.690 --> 00:28:30.300
you first define the angle
and height in object space

00:28:30.300 --> 00:28:31.050
and image, right?

00:28:31.050 --> 00:28:37.740
So here I have alpha
i and xi, which

00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:44.560
is this angle and the height
of the image, h i actually.

00:28:49.300 --> 00:28:55.300
And the input was xo and ho.

00:28:55.300 --> 00:28:59.765
It's just this angle
and this height.

00:28:59.765 --> 00:29:03.780
This ray is propagating
from left to right,

00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:08.000
but I write the metrics
from right to left, right?

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:11.990
So first thing is the
propagation from here to here,

00:29:11.990 --> 00:29:15.000
which is the distance by s o.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:25.700
So the first matrix should
be 1 0, s 1, am I right?

00:29:28.470 --> 00:29:34.790
Oh, as oh Yes so we just first
consider from here to here.

00:29:34.790 --> 00:29:37.580
And then you have the
lens, which we just

00:29:37.580 --> 00:29:46.360
derived last time, which was
1 negative 1 over f, 0 and 1.

00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:51.980
And the next one is from here
to here, the same propagation.

00:29:51.980 --> 00:29:58.290
So we have 1 0, si 1.

00:29:58.290 --> 00:30:01.080
So this is the matrix
formulation in this case.

00:30:06.580 --> 00:30:10.620
So if I compute
these matrices, then

00:30:10.620 --> 00:30:13.440
actually I get this equation.

00:30:19.050 --> 00:30:35.766
So let me write s o f si plus
s o minus si s o f 1 over f,

00:30:35.766 --> 00:30:39.526
1 minus i over f ho.

00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:51.840
So can you explain the imaging
condition from this matrix?

00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:56.040
So we just derived the relation
between angle and height

00:30:56.040 --> 00:30:59.730
in object, for the angle
and height in image.

00:30:59.730 --> 00:31:02.050
And we have the
transfer matrix here.

00:31:02.050 --> 00:31:05.070
So what's the imaging
condition in this case?

00:31:14.437 --> 00:31:16.800
So let's go back to
the first [INAUDIBLE]..

00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:18.400
So what is the image?

00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:23.700
So we have a bunch of rays
starting from the object point.

00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:27.540
And then all they arrive at the
same point in the image, right?

00:31:27.540 --> 00:31:34.200
So if you just think about the h
i and ho here, so at that point

00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:37.560
all these rays have
the same height, ho.

00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:41.940
But they have different
alpha o, these guys, right?

00:31:41.940 --> 00:31:46.770
But the image aside, the
same thing, all these rays

00:31:46.770 --> 00:31:48.690
they have the same height, h i.

00:31:48.690 --> 00:31:52.250
But they have a
different angle, alpha i.

00:31:52.250 --> 00:31:56.220
So if you just compare
the h i and ho,

00:31:56.220 --> 00:31:58.650
you know, those rays,
even though they

00:31:58.650 --> 00:32:01.200
have different angles, but
they have the same height,

00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:11.740
which means actually
this h i should

00:32:11.740 --> 00:32:15.090
be independent from alpha 0.

00:32:15.090 --> 00:32:22.590
Because no matter how
they depart at that point,

00:32:22.590 --> 00:32:24.497
they have the same
height here, right?

00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:31.820
So the answer is
actually this term,

00:32:31.820 --> 00:32:35.960
because this is alpha i and h i.

00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:38.920
So this term should be 0.

00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:42.860
Because as I just
described, h i should

00:32:42.860 --> 00:32:48.470
be independent on
alpha object, right?

00:32:48.470 --> 00:32:52.460
So if I do the math,
then this is 1 over--

00:32:52.460 --> 00:32:54.920
I just divide by s o and si.

00:32:54.920 --> 00:33:00.430
So this one is 1 over s o
plus 1 over si minus 1 over f.

00:33:00.430 --> 00:33:07.470
It should be 0, which
is, again, the lens law.

00:33:13.950 --> 00:33:17.770
Yeah, so that's the
[INAUDIBLE] I described.

00:33:17.770 --> 00:33:27.620
And if I plug in this
equation in this matrix,

00:33:27.620 --> 00:33:33.740
finally I get these matrices So
if I continue at this occasion

00:33:33.740 --> 00:33:43.010
then minus x over F1
of them zero minus x I

00:33:43.010 --> 00:33:52.350
over f OK so the
upper right on is

00:33:52.350 --> 00:33:55.650
we still have a
negative on about f

00:33:55.650 --> 00:33:59.130
which is our last
power or optical power

00:33:59.130 --> 00:34:03.710
and what is this
time the upper limit

00:34:03.710 --> 00:34:14.500
Yeah this the last time
negative x I over f anyone

00:34:14.500 --> 00:34:16.576
and there It's easy one.

00:34:21.091 --> 00:34:22.133
Press the button, please.

00:34:24.550 --> 00:34:25.550
AUDIENCE: Magnification?

00:34:25.550 --> 00:34:26.449
SE BAEK OH: Yes.

00:34:26.449 --> 00:34:29.510
Since this time is 0, so if
you think about the second row

00:34:29.510 --> 00:34:34.850
here, then you have the
h i is just this guy

00:34:34.850 --> 00:34:36.580
multiplied by ho, right?

00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:42.480
So if you just think about
the second element here,

00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:50.020
then h i is negative xi over f,
which is ho or object height.

00:34:50.020 --> 00:34:52.889
So this time actually
tells you the relation

00:34:52.889 --> 00:34:56.100
between the object
height and image height,

00:34:56.100 --> 00:34:58.516
which is the magnification.

00:34:58.516 --> 00:35:00.860
So I should say the
lateral magnification,

00:35:00.860 --> 00:35:02.540
because we are talking
about the size.

00:35:02.540 --> 00:35:04.570
So this term is magnification.

00:35:04.570 --> 00:35:13.160
And it turns out that the
upper left term, this term, we

00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:14.780
call the angular magnification.

00:35:14.780 --> 00:35:19.250
Because there is related
with the alpha i and alpha o.

00:35:19.250 --> 00:35:22.070
To be more precise, actually
angular magnification

00:35:22.070 --> 00:35:26.510
is defined by the
ratio of change

00:35:26.510 --> 00:35:30.210
in the image angle
and object angle.

00:35:30.210 --> 00:35:34.520
And if you do the math, then
we finally get this term,

00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:36.770
negative xo over f.

00:35:36.770 --> 00:35:41.970
And it turns out that the
angular magnification is

00:35:41.970 --> 00:35:44.286
1 over lateral magnification.

00:35:53.230 --> 00:35:53.780
Yes.

00:35:53.780 --> 00:35:58.310
AUDIENCE: Yeah, what's the
idea of angular magnification?

00:35:58.310 --> 00:36:00.530
We understand that lateral
magnification means

00:36:00.530 --> 00:36:03.086
how much the object is scaled.

00:36:03.086 --> 00:36:04.310
Yes.

00:36:04.310 --> 00:36:09.730
But in the case of
imaging, what does it mean?

00:36:09.730 --> 00:36:11.700
SE BAEK OH: That's
actually a good question.

00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:14.858
So actually, if you see the
definition of the angular

00:36:14.858 --> 00:36:17.150
magnification, it's actually
there is the delta, right?

00:36:17.150 --> 00:36:23.060
So this delta alpha
change in image angle

00:36:23.060 --> 00:36:27.740
over change in object
angle, which means let's

00:36:27.740 --> 00:36:30.420
think about us those
rays here and here.

00:36:30.420 --> 00:36:34.610
So you have the ray
angle in object space

00:36:34.610 --> 00:36:36.650
and another ray in image space.

00:36:36.650 --> 00:36:39.230
If you change this
angle in object space,

00:36:39.230 --> 00:36:43.120
then you're going to also
change the angle in ray,

00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:45.720
I mean in this side,
the image space.

00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:47.690
So actually, angular
magnification

00:36:47.690 --> 00:36:49.740
tells you how they are related.

00:36:49.740 --> 00:36:57.140
So if you change this much, then
what do you get in this side?

00:36:57.140 --> 00:37:00.840
How much change you
get in image space?

00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:04.160
So I guess that's the
proper interpretation

00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:07.155
of angular magnification.

00:37:07.155 --> 00:37:08.530
It's the answer
to your question?

00:37:14.362 --> 00:37:15.320
AUDIENCE: Yeah, thanks.

00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:16.028
SE BAEK OH: Yeah.

00:37:16.028 --> 00:37:18.920
AUDIENCE: And does it
relate to numerical aperture

00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:19.820
in some sense?

00:37:23.530 --> 00:37:24.292
SE BAEK OH: Sure.

00:37:24.292 --> 00:37:25.750
Actually, the
angular magnification

00:37:25.750 --> 00:37:29.900
is xo over f, right?

00:37:29.900 --> 00:37:30.790
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:37:30.790 --> 00:37:32.200
SE BAEK OH: Not really.

00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:35.080
Yeah, it just depend on the--

00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:37.600
you know, in this case
we don't have the notion

00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:39.020
of the size of the lens here.

00:37:39.020 --> 00:37:39.290
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:37:39.290 --> 00:37:40.623
SE BAEK OH: So it's not related.

00:37:40.623 --> 00:37:41.660
Yeah.

00:37:41.660 --> 00:37:42.670
AUDIENCE: Yeah, thanks.

00:37:45.220 --> 00:37:46.470
SE BAEK OH: Any more question?

00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:55.922
I'm supposed to go very slowly,
but there's no questions.

00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:09.470
Then let's talk about the
next topic, so thick lens.

00:38:09.470 --> 00:38:11.860
So, so far, we just think
about just thin lens.

00:38:11.860 --> 00:38:15.490
All these were ray transfer
matrices or imaging condition.

00:38:15.490 --> 00:38:18.880
We just consider the thin lens,
which has the two curvature.

00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:23.210
But we didn't really account
for the thickness of the lens.

00:38:23.210 --> 00:38:28.080
But if you think about the
real lens we've just seen,

00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:31.390
the biconvex lens, actually
they have finite thickness,

00:38:31.390 --> 00:38:32.090
like this.

00:38:32.090 --> 00:38:34.720
So you have the first
surface and second surface,

00:38:34.720 --> 00:38:36.830
but it has the finite thickness.

00:38:36.830 --> 00:38:41.110
So what is the more
accurate or, I should say,

00:38:41.110 --> 00:38:46.615
more rigorous way to model,
to make a model for this lens?

00:38:46.615 --> 00:38:48.880
This answer is obvious, right?

00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:53.680
So you just first take the
refraction at first surface

00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:58.360
and just propagate the array
inside the glass, right?

00:38:58.360 --> 00:39:01.060
And then take the
second refraction

00:39:01.060 --> 00:39:02.620
at this second surface.

00:39:02.620 --> 00:39:08.420
So that's, you know, the
proper way to describe.

00:39:08.420 --> 00:39:10.800
So I can do the ray
transfer matrix here.

00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:16.480
Yeah.

00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:19.540
So we start with
the alpha 1 and x1,

00:39:19.540 --> 00:39:24.430
which is the angle and height
in left side and alpha 2 and x2.

00:39:27.470 --> 00:39:34.320
So it's alpha 2 and
x2 and alpha 1 and x1.

00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:38.010
And the first matrix
should be the refraction

00:39:38.010 --> 00:39:40.110
at this first surface.

00:39:40.110 --> 00:39:54.800
So it should be one negative
left to right and R1 1 0.

00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:58.490
By the way, is R1
positive or negative?

00:39:58.490 --> 00:40:00.672
So R1 is the
curvature, radius of

00:40:00.672 --> 00:40:01.880
curvature this first surface.

00:40:05.770 --> 00:40:07.160
We talked about that last time.

00:40:07.160 --> 00:40:10.740
If the center of the radius
curvature is that way, I mean,

00:40:10.740 --> 00:40:14.285
which is the positive way,
then this radius curvature

00:40:14.285 --> 00:40:16.410
is positive.

00:40:16.410 --> 00:40:18.740
So actually R1 is positive.

00:40:18.740 --> 00:40:23.180
And next matrix should be
propagation from first surface

00:40:23.180 --> 00:40:32.730
to the second surface,
which is 1 0 d over n.

00:40:32.730 --> 00:40:36.130
So don't forget n in
denominator, because it's not

00:40:36.130 --> 00:40:36.930
[INAUDIBLE].

00:40:36.930 --> 00:40:42.130
The ray is propagating
inside the glass.

00:40:42.130 --> 00:40:54.180
And the last matrix should
be 1 and minus negative R

00:40:54.180 --> 00:41:00.330
left to right and
radius curvature 1 0.

00:41:00.330 --> 00:41:05.480
So these three matrices
describe this thick lens, right?

00:41:05.480 --> 00:41:10.130
So we just consider the two
reflection and the propagation

00:41:10.130 --> 00:41:12.930
through the glass.

00:41:12.930 --> 00:41:15.590
And if I compute
these matrices, then I

00:41:15.590 --> 00:41:22.710
get then actually M21 M22.

00:41:27.670 --> 00:41:32.944
So I'll get the four different
elements, right, which is--

00:41:32.944 --> 00:41:35.940
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:41:36.260 --> 00:41:38.760
SE BAEK OH: So actually if you
compute those three matrices,

00:41:38.760 --> 00:41:39.540
I get this one.

00:41:39.540 --> 00:41:43.230
But I just symbolize
M11, and M12, and--

00:41:43.230 --> 00:41:46.368
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:41:46.753 --> 00:41:47.670
SE BAEK OH: Which one?

00:41:47.670 --> 00:41:49.265
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:41:49.265 --> 00:41:50.140
SE BAEK OH: d over n.

00:41:50.140 --> 00:41:50.980
AUDIENCE: d over n.

00:41:50.980 --> 00:41:51.688
SE BAEK OH: Yeah.

00:41:51.688 --> 00:41:55.150
Because distance is d, but the
reflective [INAUDIBLE] is n.

00:41:55.150 --> 00:41:56.930
So you need to divide by n.

00:42:15.870 --> 00:42:18.740
Because, previously,
we had the thin lens,

00:42:18.740 --> 00:42:25.730
which is just thin lens
like this and incoming ray.

00:42:25.730 --> 00:42:30.960
They converge at
point like this.

00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:34.350
And this was focal
length, right?

00:42:34.350 --> 00:42:37.830
And the ray transfer
matrix for this thin lens

00:42:37.830 --> 00:42:43.980
was 1 negative 1 over
f, 0 and 1, right?

00:42:43.980 --> 00:42:45.970
So we get the--

00:42:45.970 --> 00:42:46.470
yes?

00:42:46.470 --> 00:42:49.470
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:55.193 --> 00:42:56.110
SE BAEK OH: Oh, where?

00:43:01.302 --> 00:43:02.730
Oh.

00:43:02.730 --> 00:43:03.727
[INAUDIBLE]

00:43:07.840 --> 00:43:10.970
I'm sorry, yes.

00:43:10.970 --> 00:43:17.710
All right, so it should be
n minus 1 and 1 minus n.

00:43:17.710 --> 00:43:21.240
Yeah, it's confusing.

00:43:21.240 --> 00:43:25.675
Actually, the way I remember
is the reflective index

00:43:25.675 --> 00:43:28.960
at left side minus the
reflective index right side.

00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:31.410
But there was negative
sign, so yeah.

00:43:31.410 --> 00:43:32.160
I got [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:32.890
Yeah.

00:43:32.890 --> 00:43:33.390
Thank you.

00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:39.460
Sorry.

00:43:39.460 --> 00:43:40.490
Yeah.

00:43:40.490 --> 00:43:42.650
So what I was
going to talk about

00:43:42.650 --> 00:43:45.500
is if we have the
thin lens, then

00:43:45.500 --> 00:43:50.570
the ray transfer matrix it
was the 1 negative 1 over f

00:43:50.570 --> 00:43:51.590
and 1 0.

00:43:51.590 --> 00:43:53.270
But now, we have the thick lens.

00:43:53.270 --> 00:43:56.230
That's why we have
complicated these four terms.

00:43:56.230 --> 00:43:58.340
But we get the same
analogy of distance,

00:43:58.340 --> 00:44:01.300
because distance
describe how much ray

00:44:01.300 --> 00:44:04.320
bend, right, the optical
power or lens power.

00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:06.470
So we get the same
thing here, which

00:44:06.470 --> 00:44:16.480
is actually this
complicated term, this term.

00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:21.310
And since it is a thick lens,
we define a new quantity which

00:44:21.310 --> 00:44:23.500
is effective focal length.

00:44:23.500 --> 00:44:29.530
So we consider that is a single
quantity which was negative 1

00:44:29.530 --> 00:44:31.240
over effective focal length.

00:44:31.240 --> 00:44:33.070
So effective focal
length is actually

00:44:33.070 --> 00:44:38.710
the quantity inside the
bracket, so n minus 1 and 1

00:44:38.710 --> 00:44:40.840
over R1 minus 1 over R2.

00:44:40.840 --> 00:44:42.200
And we have extra term.

00:44:42.200 --> 00:44:46.190
So what is this term, the n
minus 1 and 1 over R1 minus 1

00:44:46.190 --> 00:44:46.690
over R2?

00:44:57.110 --> 00:44:57.670
Yeah.

00:44:57.670 --> 00:44:59.760
Actually, that's
what I described

00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:01.560
at the very first slide, right?

00:45:01.560 --> 00:45:04.860
So that's the lens
maker's equation.

00:45:04.860 --> 00:45:07.340
So focal length of
thin lens and you

00:45:07.340 --> 00:45:09.990
can compute the focal length
from the reflective index

00:45:09.990 --> 00:45:11.550
and radius curvature, right?

00:45:11.550 --> 00:45:13.320
But now we have
thick lens, so we

00:45:13.320 --> 00:45:16.360
have extra term, this
function of the d,

00:45:16.360 --> 00:45:18.420
the distance from the
first and second surface.

00:45:21.970 --> 00:45:25.210
So if you consider a thick lens,
then the effective focal length

00:45:25.210 --> 00:45:27.267
is not same as the
focal length, right?

00:45:30.250 --> 00:45:31.290
So we just find the--

00:45:31.290 --> 00:45:33.820
AUDIENCE: Where is the
focal length measured from?

00:45:33.820 --> 00:45:34.730
Is it from the
middle of the lens?

00:45:34.730 --> 00:45:36.440
SE BAEK OH: That's what I was
going to talk about, yeah.

00:45:36.440 --> 00:45:37.170
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:45:37.170 --> 00:45:39.420
SE BAEK OH: So we just find
the effective focal length

00:45:39.420 --> 00:45:40.350
of the thick lens.

00:45:40.350 --> 00:45:45.730
But, yeah, the exactly,
where the focus will be?

00:45:45.730 --> 00:45:47.550
That's the next question, right?

00:45:47.550 --> 00:45:50.760
Because we didn't
define any planes yet.

00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:53.460
So let's think about it.

00:45:53.460 --> 00:45:55.650
So first one is
back focal plane.

00:45:55.650 --> 00:45:59.250
So we have an
object at infinity.

00:45:59.250 --> 00:46:02.550
And so we have the ray
parallel to the optical axis.

00:46:02.550 --> 00:46:06.150
And they bend twice,
here and here.

00:46:06.150 --> 00:46:09.360
And finally, they want to
make our focus at here.

00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:11.100
So this is focal plane.

00:46:11.100 --> 00:46:15.470
And we can define the focal
length from this point, OK?

00:46:19.590 --> 00:46:21.230
To find that point--

00:46:21.230 --> 00:46:23.880
actually, this distance, right?

00:46:23.880 --> 00:46:28.380
So actually, we
defined this distance

00:46:28.380 --> 00:46:32.490
as back focal plane, so from
the second surface of the lens

00:46:32.490 --> 00:46:35.220
to this back focal plane.

00:46:35.220 --> 00:46:39.030
And then what I'm going
to do is find the distance

00:46:39.030 --> 00:46:40.340
by ray transfer matrices.

00:46:43.190 --> 00:46:58.120
So what I do is, so same
as before, alpha 2 and x2,

00:46:58.120 --> 00:47:00.010
which is here.

00:47:00.010 --> 00:47:03.910
But you know, the
x2 is 0, because it

00:47:03.910 --> 00:47:06.850
is on the optical axis, right?

00:47:06.850 --> 00:47:09.960
So it is actually 0.

00:47:09.960 --> 00:47:18.770
And input is alpha 1 and x1,
this one, so this x1 and angle.

00:47:18.770 --> 00:47:22.390
But since it is parallel to the
optical axis, the alpha 1 is 0.

00:47:26.130 --> 00:47:30.450
And I just derived the
ray transfer matrix

00:47:30.450 --> 00:47:32.930
of the thick lens, this guy.

00:47:32.930 --> 00:47:35.070
I mean this whole guy.

00:47:35.070 --> 00:47:45.370
So I have M11, M12, M21, M22.

00:47:45.370 --> 00:47:47.620
And it's not the end, right?

00:47:47.620 --> 00:47:49.930
So we have to propagate
again from here

00:47:49.930 --> 00:47:53.510
to here by distance zb.

00:47:53.510 --> 00:47:59.120
So it's going to be 1 0 zb 1.

00:48:05.210 --> 00:48:09.930
So if you solve this
equation, then--

00:48:09.930 --> 00:48:14.010
so this is just
what I've written.

00:48:14.010 --> 00:48:16.010
So we have the 1 0, zb 1.

00:48:16.010 --> 00:48:18.792
And this is our M matrices.

00:48:18.792 --> 00:48:22.200
And if you solve this equation,
then we get two [INAUDIBLE],,

00:48:22.200 --> 00:48:22.700
right?

00:48:22.700 --> 00:48:24.990
We had the two equations.

00:48:24.990 --> 00:48:29.630
So one is alpha 2 is negative
x1 and effective focal length.

00:48:29.630 --> 00:48:34.470
So this sign means this
alpha 2 is heading downward.

00:48:34.470 --> 00:48:39.770
So the amplitude means x1
over effective focal length.

00:48:39.770 --> 00:48:45.010
And zb is actually
effective focal length

00:48:45.010 --> 00:48:47.380
times 1 minus this guy.

00:48:47.380 --> 00:48:51.703
So in this case,
actually the zb is

00:48:51.703 --> 00:48:53.120
bigger than effective
focal length

00:48:53.120 --> 00:48:55.102
or smaller than
effective focal length.

00:49:06.690 --> 00:49:09.470
You know, in this case,
n is bigger than 1.

00:49:09.470 --> 00:49:13.090
So this guy is positive.

00:49:13.090 --> 00:49:17.506
So zb is actually smaller than
effective focal length, right?

00:49:17.506 --> 00:49:18.480
Wake up, guys.

00:49:24.310 --> 00:49:28.720
So we define this distance
zb as a back focal length.

00:49:28.720 --> 00:49:31.300
And we just talk about the
effective focal length,

00:49:31.300 --> 00:49:33.520
the quantity in the bracket.

00:49:33.520 --> 00:49:35.725
And the 1 over
effective focal length

00:49:35.725 --> 00:49:39.940
is power, the lens
power or optical power

00:49:39.940 --> 00:49:42.680
of this thick lens.

00:49:42.680 --> 00:49:46.250
So this distance is the
effective focal length.

00:49:46.250 --> 00:49:49.280
This is the answer
to your question.

00:49:49.280 --> 00:49:52.520
And we can do the same
thing in the other side.

00:49:57.870 --> 00:50:00.270
So we start from the point.

00:50:00.270 --> 00:50:04.200
We don't know where it is yet,
but the focal point in front

00:50:04.200 --> 00:50:07.800
of the lens, which is the front
focal plane, front focal point.

00:50:07.800 --> 00:50:09.480
And they bend twice.

00:50:09.480 --> 00:50:11.610
And finally, they
get collimated,

00:50:11.610 --> 00:50:17.170
because it's going to
the image at infinity.

00:50:17.170 --> 00:50:27.720
So the ray matrices, in this
case, are alpha 2 and x2

00:50:27.720 --> 00:50:30.630
and alpha 1 and x1.

00:50:30.630 --> 00:50:34.480
But now, we start from the
point on the optical axis.

00:50:34.480 --> 00:50:36.630
So x1 should be 0.

00:50:39.450 --> 00:50:44.520
And at the end, we are going
to have the x2, but alpha 2

00:50:44.520 --> 00:50:46.670
equals 0.

00:50:46.670 --> 00:50:49.280
So this should be 0.

00:50:49.280 --> 00:50:52.820
And first matrices
we should consider

00:50:52.820 --> 00:50:56.030
is this propagation
by the zf, right?

00:50:56.030 --> 00:51:02.970
So it's going to be 1 0 zf 1.

00:51:02.970 --> 00:51:13.310
And then we have the thick
lens, so M11, M12, M21, M22.

00:51:13.310 --> 00:51:16.430
And if you solve this
equation, then we also

00:51:16.430 --> 00:51:20.840
get the 2 [INAUDIBLE],, which is
the front focal length, which

00:51:20.840 --> 00:51:24.240
is zf from here to here.

00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:25.300
And this is what you get.

00:51:27.870 --> 00:51:33.688
And the second in x2 is alpha
1 times effective focal length.

00:51:42.170 --> 00:51:42.670
Question?

00:51:51.640 --> 00:51:54.110
I guess it's time to break.

00:51:54.110 --> 00:51:55.510
Yeah.

00:51:55.510 --> 00:51:57.090
Let's take a break here.

00:51:57.090 --> 00:52:00.515
So next time, I'm
going to continue

00:52:00.515 --> 00:52:02.890
to explain these front focal
length and back focal length

00:52:02.890 --> 00:52:04.420
and how they are related.

00:52:04.420 --> 00:52:07.320
And meantime, we had
the demo set up here.

00:52:07.320 --> 00:52:11.425
So you're welcome
to come and see.

00:52:11.425 --> 00:52:16.130
And what we have here is
actually the imaging set up.

00:52:16.130 --> 00:52:19.380
We have a single
lens here and object,

00:52:19.380 --> 00:52:20.780
which is the resolution target.

00:52:20.780 --> 00:52:22.470
And we have the screen here.

00:52:22.470 --> 00:52:24.860
So if you move this
screen back and forth

00:52:24.860 --> 00:52:28.690
or lens and the image--

00:52:28.690 --> 00:52:29.990
we cannot move the object.

00:52:29.990 --> 00:52:33.830
So basically we're going
to demonstrate the imaging

00:52:33.830 --> 00:52:34.700
condition.

00:52:34.700 --> 00:52:39.110
So if the distance
is properly located,

00:52:39.110 --> 00:52:41.690
then we are going to
see the very nice image.

00:52:41.690 --> 00:52:44.000
But if not, then the
image looks blurry.

00:52:49.860 --> 00:52:52.830
GUEST SPEAKER: So before we
continue with all the math,

00:52:52.830 --> 00:52:54.400
some of you came
to see the demo.

00:52:54.400 --> 00:52:56.550
And for the ones
that didn't come,

00:52:56.550 --> 00:52:58.320
I suggest you to
come after class.

00:52:58.320 --> 00:53:01.140
It's easier to see the
image we try to form,

00:53:01.140 --> 00:53:02.940
because we don't have
the dynamic range

00:53:02.940 --> 00:53:05.070
problem that any camera has.

00:53:05.070 --> 00:53:06.800
But anyways, the main
idea of this demo

00:53:06.800 --> 00:53:08.550
is to show what we've
been learning about,

00:53:08.550 --> 00:53:11.290
an imaging of a
single lens, right?

00:53:11.290 --> 00:53:12.780
So if you can
summarize this points

00:53:12.780 --> 00:53:15.450
so far what we've learned,
we've learned the thin lenses,

00:53:15.450 --> 00:53:17.100
thick lenses, right?

00:53:17.100 --> 00:53:18.600
So it's just a
refractive element

00:53:18.600 --> 00:53:22.050
that is capable of forming
an image from a given point,

00:53:22.050 --> 00:53:24.750
either at infinity or a close
distance, to another plane.

00:53:24.750 --> 00:53:26.130
That's what we learned.

00:53:26.130 --> 00:53:28.980
Another important point
that we've learned today

00:53:28.980 --> 00:53:31.800
is the imaging condition, right?

00:53:31.800 --> 00:53:35.010
Imaging condition
is just depending

00:53:35.010 --> 00:53:38.520
on three variables, the
distance from the lens

00:53:38.520 --> 00:53:41.160
to the image plane,
si, the distance

00:53:41.160 --> 00:53:43.020
from the lens to
the object plane,

00:53:43.020 --> 00:53:45.722
s o, and the focal
length, right?

00:53:45.722 --> 00:53:47.430
This is one of the
most important things.

00:53:47.430 --> 00:53:50.160
Because basically
this tells you,

00:53:50.160 --> 00:53:53.850
if I want to have an in-focus
very sharp, nice image,

00:53:53.850 --> 00:53:57.440
I can either play with two of
variables, keep one constant.

00:53:57.440 --> 00:53:59.640
So for example, in these
demo what I'm going to show

00:53:59.640 --> 00:54:02.100
you is how a single
lens, a positive lens,

00:54:02.100 --> 00:54:05.520
performs imaging of
a thin transparency.

00:54:05.520 --> 00:54:07.230
So in this case,
I'm going to start

00:54:07.230 --> 00:54:10.030
showing here how I'm
illuminating this transparency,

00:54:10.030 --> 00:54:10.780
which is here.

00:54:10.780 --> 00:54:14.010
It's just a piece of glass
that has some dark coded

00:54:14.010 --> 00:54:15.870
lines of different sizes.

00:54:15.870 --> 00:54:18.060
It's called a resolution target.

00:54:18.060 --> 00:54:21.160
And we're illuminating these
with white light from the back.

00:54:21.160 --> 00:54:25.080
So it's just like transparency
for an overhead projector

00:54:25.080 --> 00:54:26.320
you can think of.

00:54:26.320 --> 00:54:28.940
Then this is a
positive lens here

00:54:28.940 --> 00:54:32.250
that will basically form
an image at another screen

00:54:32.250 --> 00:54:33.480
here, right?

00:54:33.480 --> 00:54:36.900
So now, let's look at
these quantities physically

00:54:36.900 --> 00:54:38.850
that we've learned
in the math here.

00:54:38.850 --> 00:54:41.960
This distance from here to
here is the object distance.

00:54:41.960 --> 00:54:44.580
That's the s o
from the equation.

00:54:44.580 --> 00:54:47.550
This lens has a fixed focal
length, which I cannot change.

00:54:47.550 --> 00:54:50.490
It's just a piece of glass
curved in a given way.

00:54:50.490 --> 00:54:55.270
So this distance here is the
distance to the image plane.

00:54:55.270 --> 00:54:58.410
So these two distances
I really can change, A,

00:54:58.410 --> 00:55:01.740
to get a sharp focus to make
sure that my image is exactly

00:55:01.740 --> 00:55:06.390
on my screen, and/or if I want
to play with a magnification.

00:55:06.390 --> 00:55:08.310
Because remember
from the math, if you

00:55:08.310 --> 00:55:12.270
can see the notes before,
that the lateral magnification

00:55:12.270 --> 00:55:16.920
depends on the ratio
of minus si, which

00:55:16.920 --> 00:55:21.390
is these distance, over s o,
which is this distance, right?

00:55:21.390 --> 00:55:23.100
So let's lower the
exposure here just

00:55:23.100 --> 00:55:26.438
to see the image that
we have here, please.

00:55:26.438 --> 00:55:28.230
All right, so we lowered
the exposure again

00:55:28.230 --> 00:55:32.590
for the same reasons
of dynamic range.

00:55:32.590 --> 00:55:35.290
So I'm going to try to
focus here on the image.

00:55:35.290 --> 00:55:39.430
So this is the image that we
are forming on the screen.

00:55:39.430 --> 00:55:46.180
And as you can see, so there
is a bunch of lines, stripes,

00:55:46.180 --> 00:55:48.840
and squares with numbers.

00:55:48.840 --> 00:55:51.750
And it's very sharply in focus.

00:55:51.750 --> 00:55:55.050
So now what I'm going
to do, and hopefully we

00:55:55.050 --> 00:55:57.450
can see it with a
camera, is that I'm

00:55:57.450 --> 00:56:00.640
going to change the ratio
between these two distances.

00:56:00.640 --> 00:56:06.330
So what if, for example, I
want to demagnify my image?

00:56:06.330 --> 00:56:09.780
So the magnification quantities
I use describe si over s o.

00:56:09.780 --> 00:56:11.040
Forget about the minus sign.

00:56:11.040 --> 00:56:14.630
The minus sign just tells you
that it's an inverted image.

00:56:14.630 --> 00:56:17.352
si over s o, I want
that quantity smaller.

00:56:17.352 --> 00:56:18.060
What should I do?

00:56:32.840 --> 00:56:35.480
I'm going to repeat the
question one more time.

00:56:35.480 --> 00:56:38.360
Magnification equal to 1,
I want magnification, say,

00:56:38.360 --> 00:56:39.770
less than 1.

00:56:39.770 --> 00:56:42.680
How can I reduce that M number?

00:56:42.680 --> 00:56:46.150
M equals minus si over s o.

00:56:49.790 --> 00:56:51.230
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:56:51.230 --> 00:56:52.670
GUEST SPEAKER: What?

00:56:52.670 --> 00:56:55.550
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:56:56.520 --> 00:56:57.510
GUEST SPEAKER: OK.

00:56:57.510 --> 00:56:59.635
Just push the button and
repeat what you just said.

00:57:03.600 --> 00:57:05.920
AUDIENCE: Increase
the distance s o,

00:57:05.920 --> 00:57:07.883
so you move it
closer to the screen.

00:57:07.883 --> 00:57:10.300
GUEST SPEAKER: So if I move
the lens closer to the screen,

00:57:10.300 --> 00:57:15.700
effectively I reduce si,
the imaging distance.

00:57:15.700 --> 00:57:17.650
So let's try it.

00:57:17.650 --> 00:57:20.960
So I'm going to move these
lens closer to this side.

00:57:20.960 --> 00:57:22.610
So s o increases, of course.

00:57:25.210 --> 00:57:32.110
And I can just look at the
right position here for focus.

00:57:32.110 --> 00:57:34.060
So now, this
distance is smaller.

00:57:34.060 --> 00:57:37.930
And it's hard to
see with a webcam,

00:57:37.930 --> 00:57:40.150
but the image is still in focus.

00:57:40.150 --> 00:57:42.558
It's smaller, demagnified
respect to the one

00:57:42.558 --> 00:57:43.600
that I showed you before.

00:57:46.160 --> 00:57:49.570
But yeah, that basically
will accomplish this, right?

00:57:49.570 --> 00:57:51.880
So for this part, if
you can come and play

00:57:51.880 --> 00:57:53.930
with these distances
later after class,

00:57:53.930 --> 00:57:57.220
you will see how this
relationship works, right?

00:57:57.220 --> 00:58:00.280
So in this case, we have these
two variables, the s o and si

00:58:00.280 --> 00:58:01.450
that we're playing at.

00:58:01.450 --> 00:58:04.140
But as we'll see in a
second, for the eye,

00:58:04.140 --> 00:58:05.980
it's a very different story.

00:58:05.980 --> 00:58:10.750
Because in the eye, the lens
of the eye and the retina,

00:58:10.750 --> 00:58:12.635
so in this case would
be your si, is fixed.

00:58:12.635 --> 00:58:13.510
You cannot change it.

00:58:13.510 --> 00:58:15.400
It's the shape of your eye.

00:58:15.400 --> 00:58:19.030
So how can the eye focus
far distance objects

00:58:19.030 --> 00:58:22.130
or when you read nearby objects?

00:58:22.130 --> 00:58:24.100
So it has to do
similar tricks playing

00:58:24.100 --> 00:58:26.380
in the imaging conditions,
such that it always

00:58:26.380 --> 00:58:28.150
has a sharp image.

00:58:28.150 --> 00:58:31.060
The way the eye does it, and
we'll see it in a second,

00:58:31.060 --> 00:58:32.750
is by changing the focal length.

00:58:32.750 --> 00:58:36.130
So now, the two variables
become f and s o.

00:58:36.130 --> 00:58:38.900
And you can do the same trick.

00:58:38.900 --> 00:58:43.640
So this was a positive lens.

00:58:43.640 --> 00:58:47.520
We will learn about
negative power lenses,

00:58:47.520 --> 00:58:50.040
so the ones are curved
like this, right?

00:58:50.040 --> 00:58:52.320
So in these ones, we've
learned that these

00:58:52.320 --> 00:58:57.630
generate these weird
non-intuitive virtual images,

00:58:57.630 --> 00:58:58.535
right?

00:58:58.535 --> 00:58:59.910
So I was just
asking the students

00:58:59.910 --> 00:59:03.090
that came here,
what did they expect

00:59:03.090 --> 00:59:05.790
to see if I put this lens here?

00:59:05.790 --> 00:59:08.200
Anyone wants to guess other
than the students that

00:59:08.200 --> 00:59:11.100
already answered the question?

00:59:11.100 --> 00:59:13.330
What do you think will--

00:59:13.330 --> 00:59:14.710
let me put it in this way.

00:59:14.710 --> 00:59:16.760
Would I see an image and where?

00:59:16.760 --> 00:59:20.400
Or should I not see anything
if I put this negative lens?

00:59:27.980 --> 00:59:28.850
Image or no image?

00:59:28.850 --> 00:59:32.220
Singapore?

00:59:32.220 --> 00:59:35.130
AUDIENCE: Unless you form
the image with another lens,

00:59:35.130 --> 00:59:35.917
you don't see it.

00:59:35.917 --> 00:59:37.250
GUEST SPEAKER: OK, let's try it.

00:59:42.970 --> 00:59:45.480
I put the negative lens.

00:59:45.480 --> 00:59:48.760
Actually, I'm going
to put it in this.

00:59:48.760 --> 00:59:51.040
Oh.

00:59:51.040 --> 00:59:51.880
We lost the video.

00:59:51.880 --> 00:59:52.880
Give me just one second.

01:00:02.110 --> 01:00:09.210
All right, so I put
the negative lens.

01:00:09.210 --> 01:00:10.580
Let me move it back and forth.

01:00:10.580 --> 01:00:13.430
And yeah, you can see here
I have just a bright patch

01:00:13.430 --> 01:00:16.380
of light, no image, right?

01:00:16.380 --> 01:00:19.860
So you said that, if
we use another lens,

01:00:19.860 --> 01:00:22.910
we can make that image
into a real image.

01:00:22.910 --> 01:00:26.330
What type of lens do you think
we need to add and where?

01:00:35.720 --> 01:00:38.590
OK, I'll answer that one.

01:00:38.590 --> 01:00:39.090
OK.

01:00:39.090 --> 01:00:40.060
You can answer?

01:00:43.540 --> 01:00:46.900
AUDIENCE: A positive lens
after the negative lens,

01:00:46.900 --> 01:00:49.620
before the screen?

01:00:49.620 --> 01:00:51.580
GUEST SPEAKER: Exactly.

01:00:51.580 --> 01:00:53.770
So essentially, physically
what this is doing

01:00:53.770 --> 01:00:56.170
is that the light going
out from the object

01:00:56.170 --> 01:00:59.930
gets even bent
outwards more, right?

01:00:59.930 --> 01:01:02.470
So it basically essentially
forms a virtual object

01:01:02.470 --> 01:01:03.498
behind the lens, right?

01:01:03.498 --> 01:01:05.290
So the positive lens,
what it's going to do

01:01:05.290 --> 01:01:09.400
is grab these outward rays and
focus them back into the screen

01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:10.733
to form an image.

01:01:10.733 --> 01:01:11.650
And let's just try it.

01:01:15.350 --> 01:01:17.090
Now, I have the two lenses.

01:01:19.715 --> 01:01:22.343
Just make sure that
the exposure is--

01:01:22.343 --> 01:01:23.510
We're reducing the exposure.

01:01:33.480 --> 01:01:37.290
Oh, it's hard to see here, but
there's lines again, right?

01:01:37.290 --> 01:01:39.130
So then we have an image.

01:01:39.130 --> 01:01:41.790
So essentially, as I
was mentioning before,

01:01:41.790 --> 01:01:44.100
this is what our
eye would do for us

01:01:44.100 --> 01:01:46.020
when we see virtual images.

01:01:46.020 --> 01:01:48.330
We have a visual
image, and our eye

01:01:48.330 --> 01:01:50.460
is the lens that
focuses this light

01:01:50.460 --> 01:01:53.520
and converts this virtual
image into a real image, right?

01:01:53.520 --> 01:01:56.950
We'll understand more how
the eye works in a second.

01:01:56.950 --> 01:02:00.130
So I think we're going to switch
back to the normal class mode.

01:02:00.130 --> 01:02:03.110
Thanks for the presentation.

01:02:24.680 --> 01:02:29.510
SE BAEK OH: OK, so we were
talking about the thick lens.

01:02:29.510 --> 01:02:32.690
So by using ray
transfer matrices,

01:02:32.690 --> 01:02:35.750
we just derived the effective
focal length of a thick lens.

01:02:35.750 --> 01:02:39.860
And we defined the back focal
plane, back focal length,

01:02:39.860 --> 01:02:42.070
and the front focal
length, which is function

01:02:42.070 --> 01:02:44.450
of effective focal length.

01:02:44.450 --> 01:02:52.810
And let's see how
they are related.

01:02:52.810 --> 01:02:57.350
So first one we have
the infinite conjugate

01:02:57.350 --> 01:02:58.320
configuration.

01:02:58.320 --> 01:03:00.170
So we have an
object at infinity.

01:03:00.170 --> 01:03:03.590
And at back focal
plane, we have focus.

01:03:03.590 --> 01:03:05.570
And we just derived
the two equations,

01:03:05.570 --> 01:03:09.680
which is alpha 2 is x1 over
effective focal length.

01:03:09.680 --> 01:03:12.800
And that focal length is
effective focal length

01:03:12.800 --> 01:03:15.570
times some extra factor.

01:03:15.570 --> 01:03:31.180
And what I'm going
to do here is I just

01:03:31.180 --> 01:03:33.520
measure the effective
focal length

01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:36.040
from the back focal plane.

01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:39.410
And since the back
focal length it

01:03:39.410 --> 01:03:44.098
means the focal plane
to the second surface

01:03:44.098 --> 01:03:45.890
is shorter than the
effective focal length,

01:03:45.890 --> 01:03:47.830
so actually in this
case we are going

01:03:47.830 --> 01:03:51.070
to have the plane, the virtual
plane, inside of the glass.

01:03:53.640 --> 01:03:58.880
And from that equation, which
is alpha 2 and alpha 2 equal x1

01:03:58.880 --> 01:04:01.330
over effective focal
length, it turns out

01:04:01.330 --> 01:04:07.510
that if you extend this ray
over here and this ray over here

01:04:07.510 --> 01:04:11.060
they actually meet
at that plane.

01:04:11.060 --> 01:04:13.930
So it's essentially
you can think,

01:04:13.930 --> 01:04:17.610
even though you have thick lens,
but you have thin lens there.

01:04:17.610 --> 01:04:24.400
So ray just-- propagating from
straight and at this plane

01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:27.460
and bend and make a focus there.

01:04:27.460 --> 01:04:30.800
So we call this plane a
second principal plane,

01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:32.800
because it's associated
with a back focal plane.

01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:37.140
So it is a second
principal plane.

01:04:37.140 --> 01:04:41.370
And you can do the same thing
in the other side, of course.

01:04:41.370 --> 01:04:44.520
So we had different focal plane.

01:04:44.520 --> 01:04:48.360
And I measure from here to
here by effective focal length.

01:04:48.360 --> 01:04:50.160
And effective focal
length is actually

01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:54.880
longer than the front focal
plane, zf, from here to there.

01:04:54.880 --> 01:04:57.940
So it's still inside the glass.

01:04:57.940 --> 01:05:00.030
And if you extend
out those rays,

01:05:00.030 --> 01:05:03.540
actually they meet
at this plane.

01:05:03.540 --> 01:05:05.390
So we call this first
principal plane.

01:05:08.720 --> 01:05:12.270
So I just put these
two figures together.

01:05:12.270 --> 01:05:14.200
So I have thick lens.

01:05:14.200 --> 01:05:16.610
And we have different
focal point.

01:05:16.610 --> 01:05:20.060
And this distance [INAUDIBLE]
the surface of the lens

01:05:20.060 --> 01:05:21.830
is front focal length.

01:05:21.830 --> 01:05:23.940
And we defined the
same thing here.

01:05:23.940 --> 01:05:26.210
So we have the back focal point.

01:05:26.210 --> 01:05:29.840
And we defined the back focal
length from here to here.

01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:34.700
And from the ray
transfer matrix,

01:05:34.700 --> 01:05:39.050
we defined the effective focal
length of this thick lens.

01:05:39.050 --> 01:05:41.270
So we defined the
first principal plane

01:05:41.270 --> 01:05:42.560
and second principal plane.

01:05:42.560 --> 01:05:46.870
And that's the
effective focal length.

01:05:46.870 --> 01:05:57.840
And so conceptually, these
thick lens can be assumed.

01:05:57.840 --> 01:06:00.880
We already computed ray
transfer matrices, right?

01:06:00.880 --> 01:06:05.610
So we can conceptually
think we have the thin lens,

01:06:05.610 --> 01:06:09.540
but it's the first surface
in a infinite thin lens.

01:06:09.540 --> 01:06:11.220
The first surface
and second surface

01:06:11.220 --> 01:06:13.080
is actually the
first principal plane

01:06:13.080 --> 01:06:14.800
and the second principal plane.

01:06:14.800 --> 01:06:20.610
And if you remember the infinite
conjugate configuration,

01:06:20.610 --> 01:06:24.070
if ray from the
object at infinity,

01:06:24.070 --> 01:06:27.850
so it's propagating parallel
to the optical axis,

01:06:27.850 --> 01:06:30.880
then it bends at the
second principal plane

01:06:30.880 --> 01:06:35.340
and make focus at
back focal plane.

01:06:35.340 --> 01:06:38.280
And same thing here
if you have the point

01:06:38.280 --> 01:06:41.580
object at the
different focal plane.

01:06:41.580 --> 01:06:44.460
And it bends at the
first principal plane,

01:06:44.460 --> 01:06:46.780
and collinate it, and
goes to the infinity.

01:06:51.840 --> 01:06:53.860
So actually reason
why we introduced

01:06:53.860 --> 01:06:55.570
this concept, the
principal plane

01:06:55.570 --> 01:07:00.060
and effective focal length
is actually pretty simple.

01:07:00.060 --> 01:07:02.950
Because we start with
the thin lens, but now

01:07:02.950 --> 01:07:04.400
we had the thick lens.

01:07:04.400 --> 01:07:07.420
So what if we have multiple
lenses, like thick lenses?

01:07:07.420 --> 01:07:10.120
So no matter how complicated
the optical system is,

01:07:10.120 --> 01:07:13.030
we can always find the
effective focal length

01:07:13.030 --> 01:07:15.820
and this first and
second principal plane.

01:07:15.820 --> 01:07:20.220
So once we have this first
and the second principal plane

01:07:20.220 --> 01:07:23.560
and effective focal
length, f here, then we

01:07:23.560 --> 01:07:27.130
can treat this whole
system as one thin lens.

01:07:27.130 --> 01:07:36.920
So for example-- come on.

01:07:36.920 --> 01:07:39.740
So we have the object
in object space.

01:07:39.740 --> 01:07:44.810
And ray, it's exactly
the same as a thin lens.

01:07:44.810 --> 01:07:46.460
We choose two rays, right?

01:07:46.460 --> 01:07:49.700
So the first one is bent at
the second principal plane.

01:07:49.700 --> 01:07:52.370
And it's passed through
the back focal plane--

01:07:52.370 --> 01:07:54.350
back focal point, sorry.

01:07:54.350 --> 01:08:02.240
And the second ray goes
through the front focal point

01:08:02.240 --> 01:08:05.910
and it bend at the
first principal plane.

01:08:05.910 --> 01:08:07.130
And it's collimated.

01:08:07.130 --> 01:08:08.780
And they meet at some point.

01:08:08.780 --> 01:08:11.960
So you can easily find the
image even though your system

01:08:11.960 --> 01:08:13.410
is pretty complicated.

01:08:13.410 --> 01:08:15.890
But once you find
these two principal

01:08:15.890 --> 01:08:17.510
plane and effective
focal length,

01:08:17.510 --> 01:08:24.670
then you can still use the
same equation as a thin lens.

01:08:30.939 --> 01:08:31.770
Come on.

01:08:31.770 --> 01:08:33.050
Yeah, all these equations.

01:08:33.050 --> 01:08:37.064
So you can define the
same thing, xo and s

01:08:37.064 --> 01:08:40.350
o, the image distance and
object distance like this.

01:08:40.350 --> 01:08:42.350
And you can use
the same equation,

01:08:42.350 --> 01:08:46.510
so Newton's form, xo times
xi equals to f squared.

01:08:46.510 --> 01:08:49.359
And the lens law, 1 over
object distance plus 1

01:08:49.359 --> 01:08:51.569
over image distance,
should be 1 over f.

01:08:51.569 --> 01:08:54.830
So f is effective focal
length in this case.

01:08:54.830 --> 01:08:59.270
And the lateral magnification
and angular magnification,

01:08:59.270 --> 01:09:02.520
they're defined the same way.

01:09:02.520 --> 01:09:05.122
And I just want to
mention that the-- yes?

01:09:08.439 --> 01:09:10.862
AUDIENCE: Where is
[INAUDIBLE] on that picture?

01:09:10.862 --> 01:09:13.820
Because the effective focal
length you talked about depends

01:09:13.820 --> 01:09:19.715
on the [INAUDIBLE] between
the first [INAUDIBLE]..

01:09:19.715 --> 01:09:21.840
SE BAEK OH: So actually,
the effective focal length

01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:25.380
depend on the stuff inside
of the neuro-optical system.

01:09:25.380 --> 01:09:27.510
So the thick lens
we just consider

01:09:27.510 --> 01:09:30.870
one thick lens-- so
one, the first surface,

01:09:30.870 --> 01:09:32.729
and lens, and second surface.

01:09:32.729 --> 01:09:36.700
But I'm going to actually
talk about that later.

01:09:36.700 --> 01:09:38.460
But what if we have two lens?

01:09:38.460 --> 01:09:41.729
So we first consider
first lens and propagation

01:09:41.729 --> 01:09:42.859
and the second lens.

01:09:42.859 --> 01:09:48.689
So you can define the effective
focal length the same way, OK?

01:09:48.689 --> 01:09:51.120
So in this case, the
effective focal length

01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:54.600
is not related to the
aperture or whatever.

01:09:54.600 --> 01:09:59.490
It just depend on the
reflective index and distance

01:09:59.490 --> 01:10:02.560
between the optical element.

01:10:02.560 --> 01:10:04.480
AUDIENCE: But in the
effective focal length

01:10:04.480 --> 01:10:07.880
you've got the parameter
b, [INAUDIBLE]..

01:10:07.880 --> 01:10:10.520
SE BAEK OH: Yeah, distance
between the elements, right?

01:10:10.520 --> 01:10:12.300
AUDIENCE: OK, so that's
width of the lens?

01:10:12.300 --> 01:10:12.967
SE BAEK OH: Yes.

01:10:15.717 --> 01:10:16.300
AUDIENCE: So--

01:10:16.300 --> 01:10:17.008
SE BAEK OH: Yeah?

01:10:17.008 --> 01:10:17.590
Yeah.

01:10:17.590 --> 01:10:20.240
AUDIENCE: Over here we have
this duality between x object

01:10:20.240 --> 01:10:22.432
and x image, but
we always have 1f.

01:10:22.432 --> 01:10:23.890
Is that only because
we're assuming

01:10:23.890 --> 01:10:25.600
that the lens has the
same radius of curvature

01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:26.510
on either side for now?

01:10:26.510 --> 01:10:26.710
SE BAEK OH: No, no.

01:10:26.710 --> 01:10:28.660
AUDIENCE: Or is
it always just 1f?

01:10:28.660 --> 01:10:29.830
SE BAEK OH: No, no.

01:10:29.830 --> 01:10:35.330
So effective focal length
is just function of--

01:10:38.192 --> 01:10:42.020
yeah, maybe it's
confusing, but the--

01:10:48.290 --> 01:10:50.780
so in this thick lens,
the effective focal length

01:10:50.780 --> 01:10:54.210
is just function of the radius
curvature and reflective index

01:10:54.210 --> 01:10:56.890
and d, right?

01:10:56.890 --> 01:10:59.370
So the concept of this
effective focal length

01:10:59.370 --> 01:11:01.740
and principal plane, we
treat the whole system

01:11:01.740 --> 01:11:03.150
as one thing lens.

01:11:03.150 --> 01:11:06.420
And one thing lens has the
same focal length in front side

01:11:06.420 --> 01:11:07.560
and rear side, right?

01:11:07.560 --> 01:11:09.060
So effective focal
length is already

01:11:09.060 --> 01:11:13.410
same in front side and
the back side of the lens.

01:11:13.410 --> 01:11:15.360
But it depends on the system.

01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:18.520
Because right now, I just
talk about this thick lens.

01:11:18.520 --> 01:11:22.750
So that's why we have only,
1, 2, 3, 4 parameter here.

01:11:22.750 --> 01:11:25.660
But if I have another thick
lens as [INAUDIBLE] here,

01:11:25.660 --> 01:11:28.390
then effective focal length
is more complicated, right?

01:11:28.390 --> 01:11:31.950
So it's also a function of the
reflective index, and distance,

01:11:31.950 --> 01:11:35.432
and the curvature of
the second lens, OK?

01:11:35.432 --> 01:11:36.390
Now, we'll talk about--

01:11:36.390 --> 01:11:40.810
I mean, actually I'll
show you [INAUDIBLE]..

01:11:40.810 --> 01:11:42.380
AUDIENCE: So for
one lens, you always

01:11:42.380 --> 01:11:45.080
have one effective focal
length to characterize

01:11:45.080 --> 01:11:45.760
the entire lens?

01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:46.250
SE BAEK OH: Yeah.

01:11:46.250 --> 01:11:47.565
AUDIENCE: No matter
what the sides are?

01:11:47.565 --> 01:11:47.820
SE BAEK OH: Yeah.

01:11:47.820 --> 01:11:49.890
So let's say if you
have the 100 length.

01:11:49.890 --> 01:11:53.084
But you can always find the
one effective focal length.

01:11:53.084 --> 01:11:53.584
Yeah.

01:11:58.020 --> 01:12:00.620
So actually, if you have
a digital camera, then

01:12:00.620 --> 01:12:03.650
typically you have multiple
lens, or three or four or five.

01:12:03.650 --> 01:12:06.440
But you only have the
one focal length in it.

01:12:06.440 --> 01:12:08.640
I mean, they only specify
one focal length, right?

01:12:08.640 --> 01:12:10.880
So that is actually
effective focal length.

01:12:10.880 --> 01:12:13.459
So they already compute
this whole thing, OK?

01:12:28.440 --> 01:12:34.280
So that's the reason why
we introduced this concept.

01:12:34.280 --> 01:12:38.090
And I just want to mention
the center ray which

01:12:38.090 --> 01:12:41.240
is starting from
the object point,

01:12:41.240 --> 01:12:46.000
but is incident on the center
at the first principal plane.

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:51.770
And if you remind the thin lens
case, then at the thin lens

01:12:51.770 --> 01:12:55.890
that ray actually just pass
through the center of the ray,

01:12:55.890 --> 01:12:56.390
right?

01:12:56.390 --> 01:13:02.237
So the same here, so that
ray is starting again

01:13:02.237 --> 01:13:04.070
at the second principal
plane, at the center

01:13:04.070 --> 01:13:05.320
of the second principal plane.

01:13:05.320 --> 01:13:08.270
And it goes to the image.

01:13:08.270 --> 01:13:15.680
And of course, if you
have the same medium

01:13:15.680 --> 01:13:19.140
in front of the principal plane
and behind the principal plane,

01:13:19.140 --> 01:13:25.790
then this angle and this
angle are same, right?

01:13:25.790 --> 01:13:27.610
Because you know,
at the center you

01:13:27.610 --> 01:13:29.130
will just have a piece of glass.

01:13:29.130 --> 01:13:31.860
So by the [INAUDIBLE] law,
they should be parallel.

01:13:37.210 --> 01:13:40.990
OK, actually, that's about it.

01:13:40.990 --> 01:13:43.120
So the take home
message is we just talk

01:13:43.120 --> 01:13:46.307
about the imaging condition.

01:13:46.307 --> 01:13:47.890
Anyway, by the way,
he's going to talk

01:13:47.890 --> 01:13:49.910
about the human visual system.

01:13:49.910 --> 01:13:51.993
So take home message
of my part is we

01:13:51.993 --> 01:13:53.410
just talk about
imaging condition,

01:13:53.410 --> 01:13:57.172
which is 1 over s o and
plus 1 over si is 1 over f.

01:13:57.172 --> 01:13:58.630
And there are some
mathematical way

01:13:58.630 --> 01:14:02.570
to find or to write the
condition, OK, which

01:14:02.570 --> 01:14:04.180
is the ray transfer matrices.

01:14:04.180 --> 01:14:10.390
And we just introduced the
front focal length and back

01:14:10.390 --> 01:14:12.310
focal length and
principal planes.

01:14:12.310 --> 01:14:14.740
But I didn't really
talk about how

01:14:14.740 --> 01:14:19.330
to find this principal
place OK so let

01:14:19.330 --> 01:14:23.590
me finish we are hard to find
the principal place if you have

01:14:23.590 --> 01:14:27.700
multiple elements which he was
the of course we have the two

01:14:27.700 --> 01:14:29.920
example of two lenses

01:14:29.920 --> 01:14:35.310
so that completes
so initially we

01:14:35.310 --> 01:14:41.940
had the example that two
lens which has focal length

01:14:41.940 --> 01:14:46.110
is 10, 10.

01:14:46.110 --> 01:14:49.730
And distance is 5 millimeter.

01:14:49.730 --> 01:14:55.300
And the object was
also 5 [INAUDIBLE]..

01:14:55.300 --> 01:14:57.870
By the way, Professor
Barbastathis,

01:14:57.870 --> 01:15:03.990
he posted a different way to do
it, to find where the image is,

01:15:03.990 --> 01:15:06.820
or how big it is, and where
is the principal plane,

01:15:06.820 --> 01:15:08.340
and what's the effective length.

01:15:08.340 --> 01:15:12.270
He summarized all
these different method,

01:15:12.270 --> 01:15:13.990
and he posted on a
[INAUDIBLE] website

01:15:13.990 --> 01:15:15.300
in a supplement material.

01:15:15.300 --> 01:15:20.670
So please go to the
website and review it.

01:15:20.670 --> 01:15:21.990
And it looks complicated.

01:15:21.990 --> 01:15:24.510
But once [INAUDIBLE],, then
it's pretty straightforward.

01:15:24.510 --> 01:15:26.520
And you will never forget.

01:15:26.520 --> 01:15:27.660
You're not going to forget.

01:15:27.660 --> 01:15:30.250
So please do it.

01:15:30.250 --> 01:15:34.050
I strongly suggest you.

01:15:34.050 --> 01:15:37.115
So let's continue how to find
the principal planes here.

01:15:37.115 --> 01:15:38.740
So there are a bunch
of different ways.

01:15:38.740 --> 01:15:41.860
So I'm going to do the
first one the easy way.

01:15:41.860 --> 01:15:49.193
So let's first find the
back focal plane first,

01:15:49.193 --> 01:15:49.860
because we know.

01:15:53.310 --> 01:15:55.440
The definition of
the focal plane,

01:15:55.440 --> 01:15:59.960
if you remind the thin
lens, like this, then

01:15:59.960 --> 01:16:05.680
these incoming rays, they
converged at one point, right?

01:16:05.680 --> 01:16:10.870
So in this case,
let's first assume

01:16:10.870 --> 01:16:16.390
I have the ray coming
from infinity like this.

01:16:16.390 --> 01:16:19.940
And I do the cascade method.

01:16:19.940 --> 01:16:22.120
So I just consider
first lens here.

01:16:22.120 --> 01:16:28.096
And where is my image?

01:16:28.096 --> 01:16:31.960
Actually, we already computed,
like, it's already computed.

01:16:38.020 --> 01:16:43.030
So this focal length is distance
10, right, so distance f.

01:16:43.030 --> 01:16:50.930
So by the first lens, I
draw only one ray here.

01:16:50.930 --> 01:16:52.670
This is parallel to
the optical axis.

01:16:52.670 --> 01:16:58.860
So third ray actually
goes to the focal point

01:16:58.860 --> 01:17:06.010
of the first lens,
which is 10, right?

01:17:06.010 --> 01:17:07.840
But we do have the
second lens here.

01:17:10.350 --> 01:17:14.720
So if you do the lens equation,
then actually it bends more.

01:17:14.720 --> 01:17:21.600
So finally, what you get is
it coming in, bend like this.

01:17:21.600 --> 01:17:26.260
It's supposed to go like this,
but it bend more like this.

01:17:26.260 --> 01:17:35.140
So this point is back focal
point of these two lens system.

01:17:35.140 --> 01:17:40.270
And if you do the same thing, so
you extend the [INAUDIBLE] ray

01:17:40.270 --> 01:17:45.100
like this, and if you
extend like this, then where

01:17:45.100 --> 01:17:51.370
they meet, actually
that's the position

01:17:51.370 --> 01:17:52.620
of the second principal plane.

01:17:55.280 --> 01:17:56.800
Because you have
all the numbers,

01:17:56.800 --> 01:17:59.930
you can easily find the
position of this guy.

01:17:59.930 --> 01:18:06.070
And so this distance is actually
the effective focal length.

01:18:06.070 --> 01:18:11.730
And the distance from the second
lens to the back focal point

01:18:11.730 --> 01:18:15.010
is actually back focal length.

01:18:15.010 --> 01:18:19.700
So we just find the second
principal plane here,

01:18:19.700 --> 01:18:22.570
second principal plane.

01:18:22.570 --> 01:18:24.610
And you can do the same
thing in object side.

01:18:24.610 --> 01:18:36.090
You start with the point
source on optical axis.

01:18:36.090 --> 01:18:40.890
And at the end, you're going
to get the collimated light.

01:18:40.890 --> 01:18:45.840
So since it is symmetric,
so it's actually

01:18:45.840 --> 01:18:49.450
you're going to put the ray
like this and bend like this.

01:18:49.450 --> 01:18:50.970
And it's finally collimated.

01:18:50.970 --> 01:18:53.200
So if you do the same
thing, then you're

01:18:53.200 --> 01:18:56.760
going to get the first
principal plane here.

01:18:56.760 --> 01:19:01.660
And this is effective
focal length,

01:19:01.660 --> 01:19:03.140
which is same as before.

01:19:03.140 --> 01:19:11.010
And you can find the front
focal plane, front focal length.

01:19:11.010 --> 01:19:14.610
So that's the just
conceptual way

01:19:14.610 --> 01:19:17.730
to find the principal plane
and effective focal length.

01:19:17.730 --> 01:19:21.130
But if you want to be
accurate or precise,

01:19:21.130 --> 01:19:25.200
then you can always use
the ray transfer matrix.

01:19:25.200 --> 01:19:28.170
So let me do this.

01:19:34.590 --> 01:19:37.430
We have two lens,
focal length f.

01:19:41.520 --> 01:19:46.440
So let's start with
actually this interface

01:19:46.440 --> 01:19:49.400
at the end of the second lens.

01:19:49.400 --> 01:19:58.570
So we have here alpha o and
xo and here alpha i and xi.

01:19:58.570 --> 01:20:05.550
So I have alpha i
xi, alpha o and xo.

01:20:05.550 --> 01:20:08.240
And I assume this
lenses are thin lenses.

01:20:08.240 --> 01:20:13.430
So first matrices should
be 1 over 1 and negative 1

01:20:13.430 --> 01:20:17.090
over f and 0 1.

01:20:17.090 --> 01:20:21.390
And next one is the
propagation from here to here.

01:20:21.390 --> 01:20:24.070
So this should be 1 0.

01:20:24.070 --> 01:20:26.620
Actually, this is 4 1, because--

01:20:26.620 --> 01:20:28.660
that's 5, 5.

01:20:28.660 --> 01:20:33.190
And the second lens, it should
be same as the first one, 1, 1

01:20:33.190 --> 01:20:36.700
over negative f 0 1.

01:20:36.700 --> 01:20:38.320
So if you could
compute this one,

01:20:38.320 --> 01:20:47.125
then you are going to get this
is 1 minus 1 0 and 1 0, 5 1,

01:20:47.125 --> 01:20:55.070
and 1 minus 1 10, 1 0, 0.

01:20:55.070 --> 01:21:14.190
And you're getting, it should
be, 1 over 2 negative 3 over 20

01:21:14.190 --> 01:21:23.870
and 5 1 over 2 and alpha
object and x object.

01:21:23.870 --> 01:21:28.100
So I should remind the thin
lens case, which is 1 minus 1

01:21:28.100 --> 01:21:29.930
over f 0 1.

01:21:29.930 --> 01:21:34.310
So actually this guy is 1
over effective focal length.

01:21:34.310 --> 01:21:39.790
So in this case, effective focal
length should be 20 over 3.

01:21:47.870 --> 01:21:50.380
So this is how to find
the effective focal length

01:21:50.380 --> 01:21:53.560
by using ray transfer matrices.

01:21:53.560 --> 01:21:56.590
And you can find the back focal
length and front focal length.

01:21:56.590 --> 01:21:59.180
Just cascade
another propagation,

01:21:59.180 --> 01:22:01.280
you know, just like
what we did in class.

01:22:01.280 --> 01:22:06.140
So here and here, you can find
the back focal plane, back

01:22:06.140 --> 01:22:10.250
focal plane, and front focal
plane, and front focal length,

01:22:10.250 --> 01:22:15.480
and, you know, first and
second principal plane.

01:22:15.480 --> 01:22:19.810
So since Professor posted
the detailed material,

01:22:19.810 --> 01:22:21.730
he actually derived
four different rays.

01:22:21.730 --> 01:22:27.050
So please visit the website
and do it by yourself.

01:22:27.050 --> 01:22:27.550
Thank you.

01:22:54.480 --> 01:22:55.730
GUEST SPEAKER: OK.

01:22:55.730 --> 01:22:58.370
So, so far, we've been
learning about lenses

01:22:58.370 --> 01:23:02.535
and some sort of imaging
techniques and principles.

01:23:02.535 --> 01:23:03.910
But more than
that, we've learned

01:23:03.910 --> 01:23:06.380
about some optical
principles that

01:23:06.380 --> 01:23:10.400
regulate how light propagates,
namely refraction, reflection

01:23:10.400 --> 01:23:13.200
so far, total
internal reflection.

01:23:13.200 --> 01:23:17.120
So now the question is,
how does nature does it?

01:23:17.120 --> 01:23:20.690
And how has it evolved over the
past several, several years?

01:23:20.690 --> 01:23:22.700
And it actually
comes down, according

01:23:22.700 --> 01:23:25.910
to these reference
here, to eight

01:23:25.910 --> 01:23:28.220
different possible
configurations of eyes.

01:23:28.220 --> 01:23:30.310
And just by the
way, defining an eye

01:23:30.310 --> 01:23:33.890
is more complicated than
just a simple photoreceptor.

01:23:33.890 --> 01:23:35.930
So an eye, it's
a little bit more

01:23:35.930 --> 01:23:40.220
evolved like some sort of
forming either an image

01:23:40.220 --> 01:23:43.640
or a shadow based system.

01:23:43.640 --> 01:23:47.900
So these type of eyes can be
broadly categorized or divided

01:23:47.900 --> 01:23:51.140
into chamber eyes, the ones
that I'm showing here, OK?

01:23:51.140 --> 01:23:53.840
So let's look at these eyes here
and see what principles apply

01:23:53.840 --> 01:23:55.560
from what we've learned so far.

01:23:55.560 --> 01:23:58.220
So in C and in D,
we can see what?

01:23:58.220 --> 01:23:59.570
Snell's law, right?

01:23:59.570 --> 01:24:00.860
So this is refraction.

01:24:00.860 --> 01:24:03.590
So these type of eyes,
again, like our human eye,

01:24:03.590 --> 01:24:04.970
focus the light
and form an image

01:24:04.970 --> 01:24:08.960
in some sort of photoreceptors
located here, right?

01:24:08.960 --> 01:24:11.600
Then we have also
reflection based.

01:24:11.600 --> 01:24:13.220
These lenses here--

01:24:13.220 --> 01:24:15.050
I'm sorry, this
mirror base here where

01:24:15.050 --> 01:24:17.520
the light gets reflected
and forms an image

01:24:17.520 --> 01:24:19.840
in a photoreceptor here.

01:24:19.840 --> 01:24:23.000
And now, we also have another
one that is an aperture based,

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:26.270
or you can think of these has
been as a natural pin hole.

01:24:26.270 --> 01:24:29.760
And these images form
by shadows, right?

01:24:29.760 --> 01:24:31.880
So you see the
shadow difference.

01:24:31.880 --> 01:24:34.130
So these are the four
types of chamber eyes.

01:24:34.130 --> 01:24:37.310
But even more
older type of eyes,

01:24:37.310 --> 01:24:41.410
we have the compound eye, as we
said in the very first lecture.

01:24:41.410 --> 01:24:45.040
They're made out of a segmented
array of many apertures

01:24:45.040 --> 01:24:46.680
or many elements.

01:24:46.680 --> 01:24:48.530
You can think about
like many lenses

01:24:48.530 --> 01:24:52.550
for the case of our
refractive based system.

01:24:52.550 --> 01:24:54.620
Or for our reflective
based system,

01:24:54.620 --> 01:24:57.410
it's several apertures that
reflect the light somewhere

01:24:57.410 --> 01:25:02.360
here and also focus it into
some photoreceptive sensor.

01:25:02.360 --> 01:25:04.280
Or in this case,
for instance, here,

01:25:04.280 --> 01:25:08.720
each one of these segments
sees a very tiny field of view

01:25:08.720 --> 01:25:12.260
and integrates all that field
of view into that photoreceptor.

01:25:12.260 --> 01:25:14.627
So in reality, it's not
like the type of images

01:25:14.627 --> 01:25:15.710
that we're used to, right?

01:25:15.710 --> 01:25:18.020
It's just sort of
like a blurry version

01:25:18.020 --> 01:25:21.680
of our images in this case.

01:25:21.680 --> 01:25:26.610
But of course, of very
important interest to us

01:25:26.610 --> 01:25:27.900
is how the human eye works.

01:25:27.900 --> 01:25:32.060
Because as we know, we've
experienced-- we have eyes--

01:25:32.060 --> 01:25:36.228
it's an extremely robust and
very elaborate optical system.

01:25:36.228 --> 01:25:38.520
I just said one of the problems
we've had with the demo

01:25:38.520 --> 01:25:40.770
is the adaptive
to dynamic range.

01:25:40.770 --> 01:25:42.670
Our eyes can do that very well.

01:25:42.670 --> 01:25:45.480
We can also go to
read a book or just

01:25:45.480 --> 01:25:48.300
look at something far away.

01:25:48.300 --> 01:25:50.530
And we can focus pretty
well, too, right?

01:25:50.530 --> 01:25:53.070
So all these things and
all these adaptations

01:25:53.070 --> 01:25:56.760
regulate these optical
principles that we presented

01:25:56.760 --> 01:25:59.110
are actually what made
a lot of researchers

01:25:59.110 --> 01:26:01.740
to try to study the eye and
how the eye perceives light.

01:26:01.740 --> 01:26:06.630
So that's under the field
of visual perception.

01:26:06.630 --> 01:26:08.280
So this is the
structure of the eye.

01:26:08.280 --> 01:26:11.980
The eye, it's
essentially a sphere.

01:26:11.980 --> 01:26:15.680
And it's all covered
by some white opaque

01:26:15.680 --> 01:26:17.600
layer called the sclera.

01:26:17.600 --> 01:26:20.360
And that basically blocks
straight light going through.

01:26:20.360 --> 01:26:24.680
The only transparent section
of the eye is the cornea, here.

01:26:24.680 --> 01:26:27.200
So in the cornea, the
light can go through.

01:26:27.200 --> 01:26:31.040
And the cornea is the first
refractive element of the eye.

01:26:31.040 --> 01:26:31.970
It's curved.

01:26:31.970 --> 01:26:35.600
It has a refractive index
of something like 1.37,

01:26:35.600 --> 01:26:38.960
which basically is the
largest bending of light.

01:26:38.960 --> 01:26:42.915
Because it comes from
air to this 1.37 element.

01:26:42.915 --> 01:26:45.290
So that's why you can think
of that when you are actually

01:26:45.290 --> 01:26:47.660
swimming it's hard to see.

01:26:47.660 --> 01:26:48.380
Why?

01:26:48.380 --> 01:26:50.810
Because the index of
refraction of water

01:26:50.810 --> 01:26:54.360
is 1.33, very close
to that of the cornea.

01:26:54.360 --> 01:26:58.010
So then the bending of light
that occurs in this first layer

01:26:58.010 --> 01:27:00.230
is very minimal.

01:27:00.230 --> 01:27:03.890
So after the cornea,
we have some chamber

01:27:03.890 --> 01:27:08.330
filled with a solution called
aqueous humor, which basically

01:27:08.330 --> 01:27:13.080
nourishes the eye, especially
the cornea, keeps it alive.

01:27:13.080 --> 01:27:15.480
That is very similar to water.

01:27:15.480 --> 01:27:18.030
Now, we have then the iris.

01:27:18.030 --> 01:27:21.085
The iris is the element
that controls-- well,

01:27:21.085 --> 01:27:23.460
it's functional purpose is to
control the amount of light

01:27:23.460 --> 01:27:24.780
that your eye receives.

01:27:24.780 --> 01:27:27.390
So as we know, the iris
expands and contracts

01:27:27.390 --> 01:27:30.360
depending on the amount of light
present in the environment.

01:27:30.360 --> 01:27:32.050
And actually, it's
very impressive.

01:27:32.050 --> 01:27:34.740
It can go from, like, 2
millimeters in diameter

01:27:34.740 --> 01:27:37.050
to 8 millimeters in
diameter depending

01:27:37.050 --> 01:27:39.150
on the light condition.

01:27:39.150 --> 01:27:42.750
But it's also responsible for
the nice color of the eyes

01:27:42.750 --> 01:27:46.560
that we see, like blue
eyes, green eyes, you know?

01:27:46.560 --> 01:27:47.760
That's the one to blame.

01:27:51.150 --> 01:27:55.560
The aperture or the hole that we
have is what we call the pupil.

01:27:55.560 --> 01:27:58.570
So after the iris, we have
the second most-- yeah?

01:27:58.570 --> 01:28:03.230
AUDIENCE: Does the color
of the eye [INAUDIBLE]??

01:28:03.230 --> 01:28:03.980
GUEST SPEAKER: No.

01:28:03.980 --> 01:28:07.200
It's due to-- and actually
it's very interesting.

01:28:07.200 --> 01:28:10.460
So no, it basically
just blocks the light.

01:28:10.460 --> 01:28:13.450
It acts like an aperture, like
of the aperture of your camera.

01:28:13.450 --> 01:28:17.960
So if you like, photography
would control the speed

01:28:17.960 --> 01:28:21.200
or the f number of your system.

01:28:21.200 --> 01:28:25.460
But the light
reflected from the eye

01:28:25.460 --> 01:28:27.770
gets the color in
a similar principle

01:28:27.770 --> 01:28:28.915
to why the sky is blue.

01:28:28.915 --> 01:28:31.040
And I'll just let you
investigate, because actually

01:28:31.040 --> 01:28:31.970
it's very interesting.

01:28:31.970 --> 01:28:34.677
And we used to have that
problem in the first p set.

01:28:34.677 --> 01:28:35.510
Why the sky is blue?

01:28:35.510 --> 01:28:37.510
Why clouds are white?

01:28:37.510 --> 01:28:40.207
And I guess the physical
phenomena of why that happens

01:28:40.207 --> 01:28:41.040
is very interesting.

01:28:41.040 --> 01:28:42.470
So you guys should read.

01:28:42.470 --> 01:28:45.390
It's in Hecht.

01:28:45.390 --> 01:28:48.210
OK, so after the
iris, we have these

01:28:48.210 --> 01:28:51.830
what is called the crystalline
lens, this lens here.

01:28:51.830 --> 01:28:54.890
This is the second optical
component most important

01:28:54.890 --> 01:28:56.750
in our eye.

01:28:56.750 --> 01:29:01.700
It's basically multilayer
fibrous mass element covered

01:29:01.700 --> 01:29:05.000
by some elastic membrane.

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:06.830
It's transparent.

01:29:06.830 --> 01:29:10.040
And it can contract and
deform itself in such a way

01:29:10.040 --> 01:29:12.540
that it changes the effective
focal length of this lens.

01:29:12.540 --> 01:29:14.075
But you can think
about this element

01:29:14.075 --> 01:29:18.050
as some transparent quasi-onion.

01:29:18.050 --> 01:29:20.240
But in addition, it has
very interesting properties.

01:29:20.240 --> 01:29:22.760
Because these lens is actually
a gradient refractive index

01:29:22.760 --> 01:29:26.600
lens, is, what we learned in
some classes, a green lens,

01:29:26.600 --> 01:29:27.840
this element here.

01:29:27.840 --> 01:29:31.670
It has a refractive index in
the core something like 1.4.

01:29:31.670 --> 01:29:35.960
And it decays all the way
to something like 1.38

01:29:35.960 --> 01:29:37.640
to the edges.

01:29:37.640 --> 01:29:39.968
So the light gets basically--

01:29:39.968 --> 01:29:40.760
see the transition.

01:29:40.760 --> 01:29:43.410
So this is similar
to the p set one.

01:29:43.410 --> 01:29:45.450
And it basically
sees multiple layers.

01:29:45.450 --> 01:29:46.910
So depending indices
of refraction,

01:29:46.910 --> 01:29:49.930
it starts bending accordingly.

01:29:49.930 --> 01:29:55.160
OK, so this lens will, in
conjunction with this cornea,

01:29:55.160 --> 01:29:57.680
form what we call
or we could model

01:29:57.680 --> 01:30:01.700
this system as a dual or
double lens optical system.

01:30:01.700 --> 01:30:05.365
And combined, they
have an optical power--

01:30:05.365 --> 01:30:06.740
and remember the
optical power is

01:30:06.740 --> 01:30:12.110
1 over the focal length, which
it's measure in diopters--

01:30:12.110 --> 01:30:14.200
of equivalent of something
like 59 diopters,

01:30:14.200 --> 01:30:17.750
just so you get an idea
for an unaccommodated eye

01:30:17.750 --> 01:30:21.330
or a relaxed eye just
looking at infinity.

01:30:21.330 --> 01:30:23.840
So then after this lens,
we have another chamber

01:30:23.840 --> 01:30:26.540
with another fluid
called vitreous humor.

01:30:26.540 --> 01:30:29.810
And it's another fluid that
basically gives support

01:30:29.810 --> 01:30:31.280
to the eye.

01:30:31.280 --> 01:30:34.070
And going back to our question,
I think someone in Singapore

01:30:34.070 --> 01:30:39.500
had in the very first
lecture, this fluid

01:30:39.500 --> 01:30:45.090
has a lot of little
particles floating, debris.

01:30:45.090 --> 01:30:46.980
And actually sometimes
you can see them.

01:30:46.980 --> 01:30:48.560
And maybe many of
you have seen them.

01:30:48.560 --> 01:30:50.550
If you see to the sky
or you squint your eyes

01:30:50.550 --> 01:30:53.130
and see a bright
light source, you

01:30:53.130 --> 01:30:57.570
see the shadows of these little
particles that are freely

01:30:57.570 --> 01:31:00.030
flowing in the vitreous humor.

01:31:00.030 --> 01:31:02.400
And you can see the fringes
if you look carefully

01:31:02.400 --> 01:31:05.890
of the light refracting that.

01:31:05.890 --> 01:31:07.780
OK, so after that,
the light basically

01:31:07.780 --> 01:31:09.700
gets focused into the retina.

01:31:09.700 --> 01:31:13.600
We know the retina is
composed of photoreceptors,

01:31:13.600 --> 01:31:16.330
photoreceptive
cells, cone and rods.

01:31:16.330 --> 01:31:20.020
And I'm going to explain
those in a couple of slides.

01:31:20.020 --> 01:31:23.020
And then we can also
identify two other points.

01:31:23.020 --> 01:31:26.110
We identify here that
each of these cells

01:31:26.110 --> 01:31:27.550
are connected to optical nerves.

01:31:27.550 --> 01:31:29.860
And they all basically
come together

01:31:29.860 --> 01:31:32.840
into this output that
goes to the brain.

01:31:32.840 --> 01:31:34.777
And this is what
constitutes the blind spot.

01:31:34.777 --> 01:31:35.860
And I also explained that.

01:31:35.860 --> 01:31:38.860
And we have a fun
exercise in a second.

01:31:38.860 --> 01:31:41.920
And we also have
this other region,

01:31:41.920 --> 01:31:45.340
which is like a spot of 3
millimeters in diameter,

01:31:45.340 --> 01:31:45.950
more or less.

01:31:45.950 --> 01:31:46.950
It's like a yellow spot.

01:31:46.950 --> 01:31:48.790
It's called the macula.

01:31:48.790 --> 01:31:51.670
And it has the largest
concentration of cones.

01:31:51.670 --> 01:31:55.120
And I'll explain what is its
role, but it is very important.

01:31:55.120 --> 01:31:58.030
Just that section here
accounts for 90% to 95%

01:31:58.030 --> 01:32:01.480
of our visual perception.

01:32:01.480 --> 01:32:06.280
So I talked about the ability
of these crystalline lens

01:32:06.280 --> 01:32:08.800
to accommodate, change
the focal length.

01:32:08.800 --> 01:32:11.200
And similar to this demo
that we were changing

01:32:11.200 --> 01:32:14.060
the distance between these
guys, well, in this case,

01:32:14.060 --> 01:32:17.307
as I said before, this
isn't fixed, right,

01:32:17.307 --> 01:32:19.390
unless you have some sort
of disease that actually

01:32:19.390 --> 01:32:20.810
changes the length of your eye.

01:32:20.810 --> 01:32:23.960
And that actually happens.

01:32:23.960 --> 01:32:25.700
We can think of as this fixed.

01:32:25.700 --> 01:32:29.350
So if we want to focus
objects other than infinity,

01:32:29.350 --> 01:32:31.952
we need to play now with
a focal length, right?

01:32:31.952 --> 01:32:33.910
So now, this lens has to
be capable of changing

01:32:33.910 --> 01:32:36.550
the effective focal
length in such a way

01:32:36.550 --> 01:32:38.530
that it will
conserve or preserve

01:32:38.530 --> 01:32:40.760
the imaging distance here.

01:32:40.760 --> 01:32:44.740
So here, this lens does it
by contracting or expanding

01:32:44.740 --> 01:32:47.920
the ciliary muscles
that are connected

01:32:47.920 --> 01:32:51.010
via some fibers to
these lens, right?

01:32:51.010 --> 01:32:55.030
So in a relaxed state,
you see this case here.

01:32:55.030 --> 01:32:58.280
The radius of curvature of
this lens, it's very large,

01:32:58.280 --> 01:33:01.330
like closer to infinity,
say, like very flat.

01:33:01.330 --> 01:33:04.660
And then it focuses
nice into the retina,

01:33:04.660 --> 01:33:09.670
like a plane wave, whereas,
for nearby objects,

01:33:09.670 --> 01:33:12.010
these muscles are stressed.

01:33:12.010 --> 01:33:14.980
So then the radius of
curvature of the lens changes.

01:33:14.980 --> 01:33:16.870
The focal length changes.

01:33:16.870 --> 01:33:22.900
Now, this image is focusing
to, again, the retina.

01:33:22.900 --> 01:33:27.580
So we can think about some
of the conditions that

01:33:27.580 --> 01:33:31.540
would affect the normal
behavior of the lens of the eye.

01:33:31.540 --> 01:33:35.570
And the two very important
conditions that we have

01:33:35.570 --> 01:33:38.510
is farsighted or nearsighted.

01:33:38.510 --> 01:33:42.260
So in the farsighted
case, for example, our eye

01:33:42.260 --> 01:33:46.130
lost its ability to
focus effectively.

01:33:46.130 --> 01:33:50.060
And in a relaxed state, it will
actually form a focal point.

01:33:50.060 --> 01:33:53.990
So the back focal point, it will
be far away behind our retina.

01:33:53.990 --> 01:33:56.720
So actually what you see
would be a blurry image.

01:33:56.720 --> 01:33:59.270
In their myopia
case, or nearsighted,

01:33:59.270 --> 01:34:00.170
you see the opposite.

01:34:00.170 --> 01:34:03.050
Now, the point is formed
in front of the retina.

01:34:03.050 --> 01:34:05.330
And again, you see
a blurry signal.

01:34:05.330 --> 01:34:08.870
And by the way, a far point
for a normal healthy eye

01:34:08.870 --> 01:34:11.910
it starts from something
like 5 meters on.

01:34:11.910 --> 01:34:14.190
So 5 meters, more or less,
what you can see there

01:34:14.190 --> 01:34:16.100
is still like a five point.

01:34:16.100 --> 01:34:18.710
So for someone that
suffers myopia, typically

01:34:18.710 --> 01:34:21.980
they see close by
objects pretty fine.

01:34:21.980 --> 01:34:24.290
But far objects,
let's say further than

01:34:24.290 --> 01:34:27.180
the far point, something
like 5 meters away,

01:34:27.180 --> 01:34:29.250
they become blurry.

01:34:29.250 --> 01:34:32.990
And the near point, which is the
counterpart of the far point,

01:34:32.990 --> 01:34:34.640
is how close can we see.

01:34:34.640 --> 01:34:36.920
That's a point that
also varies with age.

01:34:36.920 --> 01:34:39.695
Normally, teenagers
the closer they can see

01:34:39.695 --> 01:34:41.590
is something like 7 centimeters.

01:34:41.590 --> 01:34:43.910
For us, maybe it's
around 10 to 12--

01:34:43.910 --> 01:34:45.830
you can try later by
just trying to focus

01:34:45.830 --> 01:34:47.870
your notebook, centimeters.

01:34:47.870 --> 01:34:50.130
And then if you are
over 60 years old,

01:34:50.130 --> 01:34:53.970
it goes up to 100 centimeters.

01:34:53.970 --> 01:34:55.670
So basically, you
can see how the eye

01:34:55.670 --> 01:34:59.240
starts decaying in
its ability to modify

01:34:59.240 --> 01:35:01.580
this crystalline lens.

01:35:01.580 --> 01:35:06.670
So to correct for
these conditions,

01:35:06.670 --> 01:35:09.360
we can use what we've
learned so far, positive

01:35:09.360 --> 01:35:11.370
and negative lenses, right?

01:35:11.370 --> 01:35:12.660
So let's think about it.

01:35:12.660 --> 01:35:16.170
In this case, the rays
are not focusing enough,

01:35:16.170 --> 01:35:18.150
are not bending enough, right?

01:35:18.150 --> 01:35:20.760
Because they are basically
focusing behind that.

01:35:20.760 --> 01:35:24.000
So I want to help the rays
to focus a little bit more.

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:29.310
So a positive power lens or a
positive lens, like this one,

01:35:29.310 --> 01:35:32.870
allows me to bend the
rays inward more, right?

01:35:32.870 --> 01:35:34.710
And this essentially
what this is happening.

01:35:34.710 --> 01:35:38.730
The positive power bends these
parallel rays more and then

01:35:38.730 --> 01:35:45.810
assures that this
focuses in the retina.

01:35:45.810 --> 01:35:47.640
So let me ask a question.

01:35:47.640 --> 01:35:51.570
What do you think happens
with the magnification

01:35:51.570 --> 01:35:55.010
for this case?

01:35:55.010 --> 01:35:56.260
Any idea?

01:35:56.260 --> 01:35:57.830
For those of you
that wear glasses,

01:35:57.830 --> 01:36:02.750
do you guys see the
world larger, magnified?

01:36:02.750 --> 01:36:03.610
No?

01:36:03.610 --> 01:36:05.880
There is shaking head, no.

01:36:05.880 --> 01:36:07.390
Why do you think
it's not the case?

01:36:21.920 --> 01:36:25.240
OK-- so the power of
the optical system,

01:36:25.240 --> 01:36:26.840
the compound optical system.

01:36:26.840 --> 01:36:31.450
So if you work out actually
the power of the cornea

01:36:31.450 --> 01:36:33.490
plus crystalline
lens-- which I said

01:36:33.490 --> 01:36:36.220
is something like 59
for a healthy eye.

01:36:36.220 --> 01:36:38.650
But in reality when it's
unhealthy, it changes.

01:36:38.650 --> 01:36:45.020
And if you consider the power
added by this element here,

01:36:45.020 --> 01:36:48.470
it basically comes down to the
same power as the healthy eye.

01:36:48.470 --> 01:36:52.670
So therefore, you don't
add or subtract any power.

01:36:52.670 --> 01:36:55.310
So therefore, the
magnification stays the same.

01:36:55.310 --> 01:36:57.630
For the myopia case, we
can use the opposite.

01:36:57.630 --> 01:36:59.840
We can use a negative
lens, as shown here,

01:36:59.840 --> 01:37:03.043
to actually bend the rays a
little bit outwards, right?

01:37:03.043 --> 01:37:04.460
So essentially
this is interesting

01:37:04.460 --> 01:37:08.300
because, again the myopia case
you cannot you see far away

01:37:08.300 --> 01:37:12.890
objects blurry right but
some objects are closer than

01:37:12.890 --> 01:37:15.740
the fire point you can see them
fine so what the negative lens

01:37:15.740 --> 01:37:16.590
is doing--

01:37:16.590 --> 01:37:18.770
and again, going back to
these virtual images--

01:37:18.770 --> 01:37:23.450
is bringing a far away object
into a near distance closer

01:37:23.450 --> 01:37:24.770
to the far point.

01:37:24.770 --> 01:37:28.310
As you can see, this appears
to come from some virtual point

01:37:28.310 --> 01:37:30.770
here that is closer
from a region

01:37:30.770 --> 01:37:32.840
that you can see
naturally with your eye.

01:37:32.840 --> 01:37:34.670
So therefore,
intuitively this is

01:37:34.670 --> 01:37:38.825
how this ray makes
this lens still project

01:37:38.825 --> 01:37:40.910
the image into the retina.

01:37:40.910 --> 01:37:43.260
But as a side effect,
the near point-- yup?

01:37:43.260 --> 01:37:45.730
AUDIENCE: So can
people [INAUDIBLE]

01:37:45.730 --> 01:37:49.190
focal point closer
than [INAUDIBLE]??

01:37:49.190 --> 01:37:49.980
GUEST SPEAKER: No.

01:37:49.980 --> 01:37:52.800
And actually, yeah, that
was the second point

01:37:52.800 --> 01:37:54.390
I was going to say.

01:37:54.390 --> 01:37:58.243
As a consequence of
this, your near point,

01:37:58.243 --> 01:37:59.910
which I said that for
like a healthy eye

01:37:59.910 --> 01:38:04.440
would be something like 12
centimeters, becomes larger.

01:38:04.440 --> 01:38:05.790
So people that have myopia--

01:38:05.790 --> 01:38:07.290
I don't know if
there's anyone here.

01:38:07.290 --> 01:38:10.035
But probably you
know that sometimes,

01:38:10.035 --> 01:38:11.910
if you want to read a
very close by document,

01:38:11.910 --> 01:38:13.698
you need to remove
your glasses, right?

01:38:13.698 --> 01:38:15.240
And people adjust
OK for small print.

01:38:15.240 --> 01:38:16.890
They get out their glasses.

01:38:16.890 --> 01:38:19.860
And for far away objects, they
put their glasses on and see.

01:38:24.640 --> 01:38:29.348
All right, so any
other questions?

01:38:34.610 --> 01:38:37.850
OK, so the retina,
the retina has a bunch

01:38:37.850 --> 01:38:40.550
of cells that are
photoreceptive cells that

01:38:40.550 --> 01:38:45.920
can be classified into two
types, rods and cones, right?

01:38:45.920 --> 01:38:49.295
And we can see here
rods and cones.

01:38:49.295 --> 01:38:50.920
For those of you that
like photography,

01:38:50.920 --> 01:38:53.920
you can think about the
rods being equivalent

01:38:53.920 --> 01:38:57.913
of a high speed
black and white film.

01:38:57.913 --> 01:38:59.080
What is the meaning of that?

01:38:59.080 --> 01:39:02.050
It basically means that is very,
very sensitive to light, OK?

01:39:02.050 --> 01:39:05.770
For very low levels of light,
you can detect them very fine.

01:39:05.770 --> 01:39:09.240
But it's insensitive
to color and gives you

01:39:09.240 --> 01:39:11.190
images that are not
really good quality,

01:39:11.190 --> 01:39:15.450
sort of like blurry
type of images, right?

01:39:15.450 --> 01:39:17.040
The cones, on the
other hand, can

01:39:17.040 --> 01:39:24.160
be thought of as low contrast
or low speed color film.

01:39:24.160 --> 01:39:27.660
So the cones have cells that are
sensitive to red, green, blue,

01:39:27.660 --> 01:39:30.230
are responsible for
the colors that we see

01:39:30.230 --> 01:39:34.540
and are also responsible
of the nice, sharp images.

01:39:34.540 --> 01:39:39.030
So all around the
retina, we have

01:39:39.030 --> 01:39:40.320
sort of a combination of both.

01:39:40.320 --> 01:39:44.520
Although as you can see here
in the density plot shown here,

01:39:44.520 --> 01:39:47.130
there is a region that
is called the macula.

01:39:47.130 --> 01:39:49.530
And inside the macula, there
is even a smaller region

01:39:49.530 --> 01:39:51.390
of something like 300 micron.

01:39:51.390 --> 01:39:52.500
That's called the fovea.

01:39:52.500 --> 01:39:55.807
That has the highest
concentration of cones, again,

01:39:55.807 --> 01:39:58.140
those responsible for the
color vision-- as you can see,

01:39:58.140 --> 01:39:59.400
the plot just peaks here--

01:39:59.400 --> 01:40:02.520
and almost no rods, right?

01:40:02.520 --> 01:40:04.380
This is called the
fovea centralis.

01:40:04.380 --> 01:40:07.530
And that's responsible
of the central vision.

01:40:07.530 --> 01:40:09.030
And basically,
that's the one that I

01:40:09.030 --> 01:40:11.700
was saying that's
responsible for 90% to 95%

01:40:11.700 --> 01:40:14.050
of the visual
perception that we have.

01:40:14.050 --> 01:40:15.780
So it's interesting
to note that,

01:40:15.780 --> 01:40:20.605
in contrast to a normal
camera, there sampling of these

01:40:20.605 --> 01:40:22.980
photoreceptor elements-- so
you can think of it as, like,

01:40:22.980 --> 01:40:24.960
pixels--

01:40:24.960 --> 01:40:26.160
it's different.

01:40:26.160 --> 01:40:30.270
Outside the macula, they
are large and course.

01:40:30.270 --> 01:40:33.390
As you can see,
these rods are just

01:40:33.390 --> 01:40:37.980
responsible for the peripheral
vision and black and white.

01:40:37.980 --> 01:40:41.070
But in this macula, they are
very concentrated and dense.

01:40:41.070 --> 01:40:44.670
And as a matter of fact, the
cones inside this region,

01:40:44.670 --> 01:40:48.270
so when they are here, they
have a different diameter

01:40:48.270 --> 01:40:50.545
than the ones outside.

01:40:50.545 --> 01:40:52.170
There is something
like a factor of two

01:40:52.170 --> 01:40:53.253
that are actually thinner.

01:40:53.253 --> 01:40:56.570
So they are very
close packed together.

01:40:56.570 --> 01:40:58.960
So you can see very
sharp images here.

01:41:01.780 --> 01:41:06.250
As I mentioned before, each
of these photoreceptors

01:41:06.250 --> 01:41:08.260
is connected to
these nerves that all

01:41:08.260 --> 01:41:12.170
bundle up together and go to
the blindspot, shown here.

01:41:12.170 --> 01:41:17.130
Now, have you guys been bothered
by a blind spot all your lives?

01:41:17.130 --> 01:41:18.100
Not really.

01:41:18.100 --> 01:41:18.600
Why?

01:41:18.600 --> 01:41:20.142
Because as you can
see, it's actually

01:41:20.142 --> 01:41:22.650
just blocking a very small
portion of your vision.

01:41:22.650 --> 01:41:26.400
As I said, a lot of the
vision or visual perception

01:41:26.400 --> 01:41:27.887
happens in this region, right?

01:41:27.887 --> 01:41:29.470
This is not true if
you have a camera.

01:41:29.470 --> 01:41:32.700
If I have a camera and we have
a bunch of bad pixels like that,

01:41:32.700 --> 01:41:33.930
it might corrupt our system.

01:41:33.930 --> 01:41:34.763
And then we're done.

01:41:34.763 --> 01:41:37.050
Like, if a microscope
experiment, for example,

01:41:37.050 --> 01:41:37.940
forget about it.

01:41:37.940 --> 01:41:39.750
We lose a lot of pixels,
and then the image

01:41:39.750 --> 01:41:41.430
gets really corrupted.

01:41:41.430 --> 01:41:43.683
So I brought a little card.

01:41:43.683 --> 01:41:44.850
I'm going to pass it around.

01:41:44.850 --> 01:41:46.365
I have actually
multiple of these.

01:41:46.365 --> 01:41:49.110
So this is a fun experiment.

01:41:49.110 --> 01:41:53.400
It has, in the top
part, a little cross

01:41:53.400 --> 01:41:55.980
and a little black circle.

01:41:55.980 --> 01:41:57.510
In the bottom
part-- another cross

01:41:57.510 --> 01:42:00.295
and a line that is
basically truncated, right?

01:42:00.295 --> 01:42:01.920
So what you're going
to do when you get

01:42:01.920 --> 01:42:06.900
it is that you're going to have
the cross to your right side.

01:42:06.900 --> 01:42:09.750
And you're going to
close your right eye.

01:42:09.750 --> 01:42:12.390
And then you're going to
just play with this distance

01:42:12.390 --> 01:42:13.380
staring at the cross.

01:42:13.380 --> 01:42:16.950
So you're going to focus
your left eye at the cross.

01:42:16.950 --> 01:42:19.920
And you're going to
find a position here

01:42:19.920 --> 01:42:22.380
in which the circle
will disappear, right?

01:42:22.380 --> 01:42:24.210
Because the circle
essentially will

01:42:24.210 --> 01:42:27.880
be imaged into this blind spot,
and we're not going to see it.

01:42:27.880 --> 01:42:30.060
But the second one
is more interesting.

01:42:30.060 --> 01:42:34.500
Because you do the same thing,
and the hole here disappears.

01:42:34.500 --> 01:42:37.300
But not only disappears,
it gets filled with a line.

01:42:37.300 --> 01:42:39.275
So you'll see a continuous line.

01:42:39.275 --> 01:42:41.400
And it's more shocking,
because basically our brain

01:42:41.400 --> 01:42:43.525
fills that missing information.

01:42:43.525 --> 01:42:44.900
It's actually
pretty interesting.

01:42:44.900 --> 01:42:47.067
So I don't know if you can
help me pass this around.

01:43:13.328 --> 01:43:14.910
How do I go to the next one?

01:43:19.420 --> 01:43:21.060
[INAUDIBLE] this one?

01:43:24.006 --> 01:43:35.872
OK, takes forever.

01:43:35.872 --> 01:43:37.830
OK.

01:43:37.830 --> 01:43:44.660
So this is a simulation that it
was done by a group in Caltech.

01:43:44.660 --> 01:43:46.233
They were trying
to simulate what

01:43:46.233 --> 01:43:47.900
would be the image
that our eye actually

01:43:47.900 --> 01:43:49.530
is projecting at the retina.

01:43:49.530 --> 01:43:51.650
What is exactly what we see?

01:43:51.650 --> 01:43:53.600
And interestingly
enough, compared

01:43:53.600 --> 01:43:57.830
to a normal image of the same
scene produced by a CCD camera,

01:43:57.830 --> 01:44:00.470
as you can see, the
image is really blurry

01:44:00.470 --> 01:44:03.230
in the surroundings,
very sharp in the center,

01:44:03.230 --> 01:44:06.670
as we described due to
the sampling, et cetera.

01:44:06.670 --> 01:44:11.410
So the eye tries to take
advantage of the fact

01:44:11.410 --> 01:44:14.830
that it has a very small,
very sharp region in focus

01:44:14.830 --> 01:44:16.840
as much as it can.

01:44:16.840 --> 01:44:21.190
And the way it does it
is by jittering the eye,

01:44:21.190 --> 01:44:25.420
moving it at a frequency of
something like 30 to 70 Hertz,

01:44:25.420 --> 01:44:28.540
to scan a given scene and try
to collect as much information

01:44:28.540 --> 01:44:31.722
to create the scene that
we perceive in our brain.

01:44:31.722 --> 01:44:33.430
And also, there is
some interesting image

01:44:33.430 --> 01:44:36.060
processing to try to
account for this blurring.

01:44:36.060 --> 01:44:37.810
Or you can think of
that, for those of you

01:44:37.810 --> 01:44:40.102
that are in signal processing,
deep learning algorithms

01:44:40.102 --> 01:44:41.860
embedded in our brains.

01:44:41.860 --> 01:44:43.350
I think it's pretty interesting.

01:44:43.350 --> 01:44:44.965
So the phenomena of
moving of the eye,

01:44:44.965 --> 01:44:46.675
it's called saccadic motion.

01:44:51.820 --> 01:44:54.290
Also, the cones and
the rods, as I said,

01:44:54.290 --> 01:44:55.640
are connected with nerves.

01:44:55.640 --> 01:45:01.150
But it was first proposed
by studying the eye of a cat

01:45:01.150 --> 01:45:03.190
and then for humans
that the eye actually

01:45:03.190 --> 01:45:07.812
has this type of responds
to a light as stimulus,

01:45:07.812 --> 01:45:09.770
that in some regions it's
going to be positive.

01:45:09.770 --> 01:45:12.320
Some regions it's going to
be negative following what

01:45:12.320 --> 01:45:15.860
is called a Mexican-hat trend.

01:45:15.860 --> 01:45:19.200
And actually, this
response is what

01:45:19.200 --> 01:45:22.310
is responsible for
many optical illusions

01:45:22.310 --> 01:45:25.160
that we see, for
example, this one.

01:45:25.160 --> 01:45:26.240
So what do you guys see?

01:45:29.602 --> 01:45:31.310
You've seen this one
probably before, no?

01:45:34.260 --> 01:45:36.500
So you see this
flickering gray dots

01:45:36.500 --> 01:45:38.128
that are really not there right

01:45:38.128 --> 01:45:40.670
and if you try to focus your
eye and if you are like as close

01:45:40.670 --> 01:45:43.400
as I am to the projector
and I'm focusing my eye

01:45:43.400 --> 01:45:46.240
here I don't see anything of the
at least at that point I don't

01:45:46.240 --> 01:45:48.740
see any great does however if
I focus in another point right

01:45:48.740 --> 01:45:51.220
I'm also seeing this flicker.

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:11.389
Here you see a circuit powered by a battery
and connected through a light bulb. This section

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:14.789
of the circuit is made from copper foil.

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:20.029
We can put a cut into the foil to make this
circuit incomplete. Taking advantage of the

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:24.939
thermal expansion properties of copper, we
can place some candles under the foil to provide

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:31.939
enough heat to expand the foil and complete
the circuit again! Many materials, like metals,

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.100
expand when you heat them.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.730
But other materials, like polymers, shrink
when heated. The macroscopic properties of

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:39.530
both of these materials are highly dependent
on temperature.

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.730
The difference in the macroscopic behavior
of these two materials is determined by very

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:51.730
different microscopic structure. Statistical
Mechanics is the method used to describe and

00:00:53.260 --> 00:01:00.260
predict behavior at the macro-scale based
on statistical models of microscopic behavior.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.060
The first step to understanding the power
of Statistical Mechanics, is to use this method

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:13.060
to define and understand temperature in terms
of macro state parameters. The notion of equilibrium

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.110
will also prove to be useful in this exercise.

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.230
This video is part of the equilibrium video
series.

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:27.580
It is often important to determine whether
or not a system is at equilibrium. To do this,

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:34.030
we must understand how a system's equilibrium
state is constrained by its boundary and surroundings.

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:40.090
Hi, my name is Jeff Grossman, and I'm a professor
in the MIT Department of Materials Science

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:41.700
and Engineering.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:47.400
Before watching this video, you should be
familiar with the second law of thermodynamics,

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:53.670
and the definitions of micro-state, macro-state,
and entropy.

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.030
After watching this video, you will be able
to: Explain how the definition of temperature

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:06.030
arises as a derivative of entropy with respect
to energy.

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:16.250
Consider an isolated, insulated box of non-interacting
particles. We can characterize this box macroscopically

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:23.099
by 3 parameters: the Volume of the box, the
Number of particles in the box (measured in

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:28.810
moles), and the total Energy. The Volume of
the box, and the Number of particles and the

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:35.810
total energy in this box are fixed. Thus a
microstate that corresponds to such a macrostate

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:41.670
is the velocity and position {vi, xi} of each
particle in the box. With this information,

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.620
we can determine the movement and position
of every particle in the box, and we obtain

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:53.620
the total energy is ½ mv^2 summed over all
particles. As you can imagine, measuring changes

00:02:55.349 --> 00:03:01.840
in the system by tracking each and every microstate
would be a computational nightmare.

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:08.560
Instead, we consider Omega, the number of
microstates that correspond to a system with

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:15.560
macro-parameters E, N, and V. Now, let's consider
an isolated system comprised of two boxes

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:24.040
of non-interacting particles. The wall separating
the two boxes allows the transfer energy,

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:29.599
but does not allow particles to cross it.
What changes in macro state parameters do

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:36.599
we observe in our system? Pause the video
here. The volume and number of particles in

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:48.519
each box is fixed and unchanging. Because
energy, in the form of heat, can be transferred

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:55.519
through the wall, E1 and E2 can change. But
of course, the total energy E = E1 + E2 stays

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:03.709
the same, because the 2-box system is thermally
isolated. Let's count the total number of

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:09.599
microstates that the composite system can
have, which correspond to a total system energy

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:16.599
E. The easiest way to do this is to first
define a new function f(E1), which is the

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:23.889
number of microstates of the composite system
when box 1 has energy E1. To do this, we count

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:30.430
the number of microstates where box 1 has
some energy E1, and multiply this by the number

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:37.430
of microstates where box 2 has energy E-E1.
Then, to find the total number of microstates

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:46.120
for the composite system, we need to sum the
function f over all ways we could have selected

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:53.120
E1. We want to understand more about this
function f because it is key to defining Omega.

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:59.030
Let's look at a typical example to see what
f looks like.

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:04.150
We can explore the function f by considering
a simple case, where each particle can only

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:11.150
exist in one of 2 allowable energy states—one
with energy 0 and the other with 1. Suppose

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:19.560
I have 50 particles in box 1 and 100 particles
in box 2, and the total energy of the system

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:26.560
is fixed at, say, 50. In order to reach this
total energy, the energy E1 in box 1 can range

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:34.400
from 0 to 50. This is the graph for the number
of microstates with total energy E having

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:41.460
a given E1. We get this graph by looking at
all ways to assign every particle a 0 or 1

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:49.130
state such that the energy in box 1 is E1
and the energy in box 2 is E-E1. We can imagine

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:56.080
that the sum that defines omega is the area
under this graph.

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:03.080
Look at how peaked this graph is! With increasing
numbers of particles, the graph becomes more

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:10.310
and more strongly peaked. Remember, in a realistic
situation, the number of particles is going

00:06:10.509 --> 00:06:16.150
to be on the order of Avagadro's number. Which
means the distribution of energies will be

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:23.150
highly peaked with a very small standard deviation.
Statistically, this means as the Number of

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:29.770
particles becomes larger, the energy in box
1 is almost always very close to this peak

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:36.770
value. Let's define Em to be the box 1 energy
corresponding to the peak value of f. So how

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:47.270
do we find Em? Pause the video and think about
it. To find Em, we want to maximize the function

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:55.630
f with respect to E1.

00:06:55.630 --> 00:07:01.080
Since the volume, number, and total energy
of the system are fixed, differentiate f with

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:06.770
respect to E1. The maximum occurs when this
derivative is zero.

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:11.720
Take a moment to carry out this derivative,
and check your solution with ours. Pause the

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:18.720
video.

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:26.440
We obtain the following expression. Thus the
Energy Em that leads to the greatest number

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:32.610
of composite system microstates is defined
by this elegant condition.

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:39.610
So let's define a new macro-parameter, S,
called "entropy". The kB is Boltzmann's constant.

00:07:40.669 --> 00:07:46.800
We'll explain why we include it later. By
defining this new term, entropy, our condition

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:53.020
above occurs when the derivative of the entropy
of box 1 with respect to the energy of box

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:59.039
1 is equal to the derivative of the entropy
of box 2 with respect to the energy of box

00:07:59.039 --> 00:08:05.960
2.

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:12.960
So on average, we expect the energy of box
1 to be very close to Em. But what happens

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:18.819
if box 1 starts with some different energy,
maybe an energy significantly different from

00:08:18.819 --> 00:08:25.819
Em? Statistically, because such a state is
so much less likely, when contact between

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:32.209
the boxes is made, the energy will redistribute
over time towards the most likely state, where

00:08:32.209 --> 00:08:35.349
box 1 has energy Em.

00:08:35.349 --> 00:08:42.139
This process of energy redistribution is called
equilibration. And the state with the highest

00:08:42.139 --> 00:08:45.449
likelihood is called equilibrium!

00:08:45.449 --> 00:08:50.899
How do we know we've landed in an equilibrium
state? If the derivative condition we found

00:08:50.899 --> 00:08:57.329
earlier, evaluated at the average energy of
each box is held, it indicates that we are

00:08:57.329 --> 00:09:04.329
at equilibrium. Note that in the simple example
scenario we considered earlier, it was NOT

00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:09.999
the case that the energy of each box was the
same. It is the derivative of entropy with

00:09:09.999 --> 00:09:15.879
respect to energy for each box evaluated at
the energy, number, and volume of each box

00:09:15.879 --> 00:09:20.189
that must be equal at equilibrium.

00:09:20.189 --> 00:09:26.470
This suggests that we should define the derivative
of entropy with respect to energy to be a

00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:33.470
new system variable. But what would this variable
represent physically?

00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:40.300
To figure out what it should be, think about
our composite system. The volume of each box

00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:46.779
is constant as is the number of particles
in each box. The wall between the two boxes

00:09:46.779 --> 00:09:53.779
allows energy to transfer. Over time, what
parameter will eventually be the same for

00:09:53.970 --> 00:10:00.970
both boxes? Pause the video and discuss.

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:09.410
Our experience tells us that once 2 subsystems
are brought into thermal contact, we expect

00:10:09.410 --> 00:10:15.959
the composite system will eventually evolve
so that each box has the same temperature!

00:10:15.959 --> 00:10:21.249
But at equilibrium the derivative of entropy
with respect to energy of each box is also

00:10:21.249 --> 00:10:28.249
equal. This tells us that this derivative
should be some function of temperature. In

00:10:28.389 --> 00:10:34.110
fact, the derivative of entropy with respect
to energy is exactly equal to the reciprocal

00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:40.519
of temperature! This tells us that when we
are measuring temperature of a system, we

00:10:40.519 --> 00:10:45.989
are NOT measuring the energy of a system,
we are measuring this derivative!

00:10:45.989 --> 00:10:51.309
There are specific units determined by the
typical way we measure temperature. This is

00:10:51.309 --> 00:10:56.910
why Boltzmann's constant was introduced into
the definition of entropy! The constant is

00:10:56.910 --> 00:11:02.980
introduced precisely so that the derivative
of entropy with respect to energy has dimension

00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:09.980
of 1/temperature.

00:11:12.279 --> 00:11:18.410
In this video we've seen that entropy is a
natural macrostate parameter, and statistically

00:11:18.410 --> 00:11:24.639
a system's microstates evolve to exist within
the maximum entropy state. This is called

00:11:24.639 --> 00:11:31.519
equilibrium. Temperature is naturally defined
as the derivative of entropy with respect

00:11:31.519 --> 00:11:37.619
to energy for a system. And this definition
allows us to understand how temperature and

00:11:37.619 --> 00:11:44.619
entropy are related at equilibrium.

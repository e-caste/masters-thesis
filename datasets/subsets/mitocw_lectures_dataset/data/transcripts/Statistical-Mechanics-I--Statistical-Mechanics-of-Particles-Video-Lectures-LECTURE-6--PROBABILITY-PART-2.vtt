00:00:20.365 --> 00:00:25.220
PROFESSOR: We'll begin this time
by looking at some probability

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.310
distribution that you
should be familiar

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:30.510
with from this
perspective, starting

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.780
with a Gaussian distribution
for one variable.

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.660
We're focused on a
variable that takes

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.670
real values in the interval
minus infinity to infinity

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.255
and the Gaussian has the
form exponential that

00:00:53.255 --> 00:00:57.450
is centered around some
value, let's call it lambda,

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:02.380
and has fluctuations around this
value parameterized by sigma.

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:07.940
And the integral of
this p over the interval

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.970
should be normalized
to unity, giving you

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:16.780
this hopefully very
family of form.

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:23.540
Now, if you want to characterize
the characteristic function,

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.120
all we need to do is to
Fourier transform this.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:36.580
So I have the integral
dx e the minus ikx.

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:39.810
So this-- let's remind
you alternatively

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.560
was the expectation value
of e to the minus ikx.

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:51.310
minus x minus lambda squared
over 2 sigma squared,

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.160
which is the probably
distribution.

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:59.220
And you should know what
the answer to that is,

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:00.480
but I will remind.

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:05.730
You can change variables to
x minus lambda [INAUDIBLE] y.

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:08.210
So from here we will
get the factor of 2

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:10.780
to the minus ik lambda.

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:19.050
You have then the
integral over y minus y

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.810
squared over 2 sigma squared.

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:29.530
And then what we need to do is
to complete this square over

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.990
here.

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:34.890
And you can do
that, essentially,

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:40.300
by adding and
subtracting a minus

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:45.320
k squared sigma squared over 2.

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:53.210
So that if I change variable
to y plus ik sigma squared,

00:02:53.210 --> 00:03:00.910
let's call that z, then I
have outside the integral e

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:10.595
to the minus ik lambda minus k
squared sigma squared over 2.

00:03:10.595 --> 00:03:14.470
And the remainder I can
write as a full square.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:25.790
And this is just a
normalized Gaussian integral

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.500
that comes to 1.

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:37.260
So as you well know, a Fourier
transform of a Gaussian

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.960
is itself a Gaussian, and
that's what we've established.

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:48.350
E to the minus ik lambda minus
k squared sigma squared over 2m.

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:51.600
And if I haven't made a mistake
when I said k equals to 0,

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:56.070
the answer should be 1 because
k equals to 0 expectation

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:58.376
value of 1 just amounts
to normalization.

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:06.850
Now what we said was that
a more interesting function

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:10.360
is obtained by taking
the log of this.

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:16.970
So from here we go to the
log of [INAUDIBLE] of k.

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:22.090
Log of [INAUDIBLE] of k is
very simple for the Gaussian.

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:35.580
And what we had said
was that by definition

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:38.490
this log of the
characteristic function

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:43.510
generates cumulants
through the series

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:49.990
minus ik to the power of n over
n factorial, the end cumulant.

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:57.510
So looking at this,
we can immediately

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:01.690
see that the Guassian
is characterized

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:07.030
by a first cumulant, which is
the coefficient of minus ik.

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:07.550
It's lambda.

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.550
It is characterized by
a second cumulant, which

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:20.480
is the coefficient
of minus ik squared.

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:22.160
This, you know, is the variance.

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:25.170
And we can explicitly
see that the coefficient

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:29.040
of minus ik squared
over 2 factorial

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:31.660
is simply sigma squared.

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:34.920
So this is reputation.

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:37.560
But one thing that
is interesting

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:40.880
is that our series
has now terminates,

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:43.010
which means that
if I were to look

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:48.280
at the third cumulant, if I were
to look at the fourth cumulant,

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:52.470
and so forth, for the
Guassian, they're all 0.

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:54.730
So the Gaussian is
the distribution

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:57.850
that is completely
characterized just

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:00.940
by its first and second
cumulants, all the rest

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:01.763
being 0.

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:09.670
So, now our last
time we developed

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:12.500
some kind of a graphical method.

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:17.840
We said that I can graphically
describe the first cumulant

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:22.110
as a bag with one point in it.

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:26.122
Second cumulant with something
that has two points in it.

00:06:26.122 --> 00:06:29.520
A third cumulant
with three three,

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:36.220
fourth cumulant with four
and four points and so forth.

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:39.190
This is just rewriting.

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:40.930
Now, the interesting
thing was that we

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:47.490
said that the various moments
we could express graphically.

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:50.540
So that, for example,
the second moment

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:56.760
is either this or this,
which then graphically

00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:01.120
is the same thing as lambda
squared plus sigma squared

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:06.440
because this is indicated
by sigma squared.

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:12.790
Now, x cubed you
would say is either

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:17.360
three things by themselves
or put two of them

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:19.610
together and then one separate.

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:23.860
And this I could do in
three different ways.

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:26.090
And in general, for a
general distribution,

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:29.980
I would have had another
term, which is a triangle.

00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:32.710
But the triangle is 0.

00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:34.940
So for the Gaussian,
this terminates here.

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:40.780
I have lambda cubed plus
3 lambda sigma squared.

00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:44.300
If I want to calculate
x to the fourth,

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:46.560
maybe the old way
of doing it would

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:50.710
have been too multiply the
Gaussian distribution against x

00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:53.620
to the fourth and try
to do the integration.

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:59.060
And you would ultimately be able
to do that rearranging things

00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:02.830
and looking at the various
powers of the Gaussian

00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:05.566
integrated from minus
infinity to infinity.

00:08:05.566 --> 00:08:06.815
But you can do it graphically.

00:08:06.815 --> 00:08:08.950
You can say, OK.

00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:14.160
It's either this or
I can have-- well,

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:16.640
I cannot put one aside
and three together,

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:18.870
because that doesn't exist.

00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:25.330
I could have two together
and two not together.

00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:28.176
And this I can do in
six different ways.

00:08:28.176 --> 00:08:31.130
You can convince
yourself of that.

00:08:31.130 --> 00:08:36.210
What I could do two pairs, which
I can do three different ways

00:08:36.210 --> 00:08:39.440
because I can either do one,
two; one, three; one, four

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:42.360
and then the other is satisfied.

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:47.280
So this is lambda to the
fourth plus 6 lambda squared

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:53.130
sigma squared plus 3
sigma to the fourth.

00:08:53.130 --> 00:08:55.678
And you can keep going and
doing different things.

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:00.856
OK.

00:09:00.856 --> 00:09:01.355
Question?

00:09:04.778 --> 00:09:05.278
Yeah?

00:09:05.278 --> 00:09:07.748
AUDIENCE: Is the
second-- [INAUDIBLE].

00:09:13.182 --> 00:09:13.970
PROFESSOR: There?

00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:17.180
AUDIENCE: Because-- so you said
that the second cumulative--

00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:18.144
PROFESSOR: Oh.

00:09:18.144 --> 00:09:19.090
AUDIENCE: --x sqaured.

00:09:19.090 --> 00:09:19.590
Yes.

00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:20.105
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:09:20.105 --> 00:09:21.015
So that's the wrong--

00:09:21.015 --> 00:09:21.931
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:09:21.931 --> 00:09:26.520
PROFESSOR: The coefficient of k
squared is the second cumulant.

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:28.210
The additional 2 was a mistake.

00:09:34.178 --> 00:09:35.120
OK.

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:35.930
Anything else?

00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:42.450
All right.

00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:46.979
Let's take a look at couple
of other distributions,

00:09:46.979 --> 00:09:47.770
this time discrete.

00:09:52.760 --> 00:10:07.170
So the binomial distribution
is repeat a binary random

00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:09.845
variable.

00:10:09.845 --> 00:10:13.110
And what does this mean?

00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:21.500
It means two outcomes
that's binary,

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:27.970
let's call them
A and B. And if I

00:10:27.970 --> 00:10:31.660
have a coin that's head
or tails, it's binary.

00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:33.390
Two possibilities.

00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:38.890
And I can assign probabilities
to the two outcomes

00:10:38.890 --> 00:10:44.854
to PA and PB, which
has to be 1 minus PA.

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:52.160
And the question
is if you repeat

00:10:52.160 --> 00:11:03.500
this binary random
variables n times,

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:17.360
what is the probability
of NA outcomes of A?

00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:25.605
And I forget to say
something important,

00:11:25.605 --> 00:11:28.410
so I write it in red.

00:11:28.410 --> 00:11:30.160
This should be independent.

00:11:33.055 --> 00:11:41.140
That is the outcome of
a coin toss at, say,

00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:43.260
the fifth time
should not influence

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:46.131
the sixth time and future times.

00:11:46.131 --> 00:11:46.630
OK.

00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:48.650
So this is easy.

00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:56.010
The probability to have NA
occurrences of A in N trials.

00:11:56.010 --> 00:11:58.480
So it has to be index yn.

00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:07.490
Is that within the n times that
I tossed, A came up NA times.

00:12:07.490 --> 00:12:11.590
So it has to be proportional
to the probability

00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:18.870
of A independently multiplied
by itself NA times.

00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:22.710
But if I have exactly
NA occurrences of A,

00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:30.950
all the other times
I had B occurring.

00:12:30.950 --> 00:12:34.110
So I have the probability
of B for the remainder,

00:12:34.110 --> 00:12:37.460
which is N minus NA.

00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:40.600
Now this is the probability
for a specific occurrence,

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:45.510
like the first NA times that
I threw the coin I will get A.

00:12:45.510 --> 00:12:48.290
The remaining times
I would get B.

00:12:48.290 --> 00:12:51.550
But the order is not
important and the number

00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:54.050
of ways that I can
shuffle the order

00:12:54.050 --> 00:12:59.480
and have a total of NA out of
N times is the binomial factor.

00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:09.990
Fine.

00:13:09.990 --> 00:13:10.830
Again, well known.

00:13:10.830 --> 00:13:12.785
Let's look at its
characteristic function.

00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:20.530
So p tilde, which is
now a function of k,

00:13:20.530 --> 00:13:23.800
is expectation value
of e to the minus ik

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:32.060
NA, which means that I
have to weigh e minus ik

00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:39.660
NA against the probability
of occurrences of NA times,

00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:53.005
which is this binomial factor
PA to the power of NA, PB

00:13:53.005 --> 00:13:56.226
to the power of N minus NA.

00:13:56.226 --> 00:14:01.450
And of course, I have to sum
over all possible values of NA

00:14:01.450 --> 00:14:09.500
that go all the way from 0 to N.

00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:13.300
So what we have
here is something

00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:18.505
which is this combination,
PA e to the minus ik

00:14:18.505 --> 00:14:21.680
raised to the power of NA.

00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:26.400
PB raised to the complement
N minus NA multiplied

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:29.890
by the binomial factor summed
over all possible values.

00:14:29.890 --> 00:14:36.610
So this is just the definition
of the binomial expansion of PA

00:14:36.610 --> 00:14:46.870
e to the minus ik plus PB
raised to the power of N.

00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:47.860
And again, let's check.

00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:50.940
If I set k equals to
0, I have PA plus PB,

00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:54.580
which is 1 raised to the
power of N. So things are OK.

00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:58.450
So this is the
characteristic function.

00:14:58.450 --> 00:15:02.600
At this stage, the only thing
that I will note about this

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:09.070
is that if I look at the
characteristic function

00:15:09.070 --> 00:15:13.650
I will get N times.

00:15:13.650 --> 00:15:15.420
So this is-- actually,
let's make sure

00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:19.280
that we maintain the
index N. So this is

00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:23.940
the characteristic function
appropriate to N trials.

00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:26.840
And what I get is that
up to factor of N,

00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:29.320
I will get the
characteristic function

00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:31.505
that would be
appropriate to one trial.

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:38.170
So what that means
if I were to look

00:15:38.170 --> 00:15:46.650
at powers of k, the expectation
value of some cumulant,

00:15:46.650 --> 00:15:52.120
if I go to repeat things
N times-- so this carries

00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:58.820
an index N. It is going to be
simply N times what I would

00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:00.780
have had in a single trial.

00:16:05.470 --> 00:16:07.490
So for a single
trial, you really

00:16:07.490 --> 00:16:13.330
have two outcomes-- 0 or 1
occurrences of this object.

00:16:13.330 --> 00:16:16.910
So for a binary variable,
you can really easily compute

00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:19.140
these quantities
and then you can

00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:24.640
calculate the corresponding
ones for N trials simply

00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:27.910
multiplying by N.
And we will see

00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:30.950
that this is
characteristic, essentially,

00:16:30.950 --> 00:16:37.090
of anything that is repeated N
times, not just the binomial.

00:16:37.090 --> 00:16:40.510
So this form that you have
N independent objects,

00:16:40.510 --> 00:16:42.620
you would get N
times what you would

00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:46.090
have for one object
is generally valid

00:16:46.090 --> 00:16:48.020
and actually something
that we will build

00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:51.270
a lot of statistical
mechanics on because we

00:16:51.270 --> 00:16:53.710
are interested in
the [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:53.710 --> 00:16:56.280
So we will see that shortly.

00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:59.070
But rather than
following this, let's

00:16:59.070 --> 00:17:03.120
look at a third distribution
that is closely related,

00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:04.089
which is the Poisson.

00:17:09.990 --> 00:17:13.359
And the question
that we are asking

00:17:13.359 --> 00:17:17.819
is-- we have an interval.

00:17:17.819 --> 00:17:24.422
And the question is,
what is the probability

00:17:24.422 --> 00:17:39.070
of m events in an
interval from 0 to T?

00:17:39.070 --> 00:17:42.420
And I kind of
expressed it this way

00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:47.680
because prototypical Poisson
distribution is, let's say,

00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:49.370
the radioactivity.

00:17:49.370 --> 00:17:52.860
And you can be waiting for
some time interval from 0

00:17:52.860 --> 00:17:56.890
to 1 minute and asking within
that time interval, what's

00:17:56.890 --> 00:18:02.410
the probability that you will
see m radioactive decay events?

00:18:02.410 --> 00:18:08.470
So what is the probability
if two things happen?

00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:28.090
One is that the probability of 1
and only 1 event in interval dt

00:18:28.090 --> 00:18:32.402
is alpha dt as dt goes to 0.

00:18:34.831 --> 00:18:35.330
OK?

00:18:35.330 --> 00:18:40.760
So basically if you look
at this over 1 minute,

00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:43.680
the chances are that you
will see so many events,

00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:47.540
so many radioactivities.

00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:50.010
If you shorten the
interval, the chances

00:18:50.010 --> 00:18:53.330
that you would see events
would become less and less.

00:18:53.330 --> 00:18:55.950
If you make your
event infinitesimal,

00:18:55.950 --> 00:18:58.650
most of the time
nothing would happen

00:18:58.650 --> 00:19:01.980
with very small
probability that vanishes.

00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:08.090
As the size of the interval
goes to 0, you will see 1 event.

00:19:08.090 --> 00:19:10.130
So this is one condition.

00:19:10.130 --> 00:19:16.589
And the second condition is
events in different intervals

00:19:16.589 --> 00:19:17.255
are independent.

00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:26.200
And since I wrote
independent in red up there,

00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:31.084
let me write it in red here
because it sort of harks back

00:19:31.084 --> 00:19:32.000
to the same condition.

00:19:34.970 --> 00:19:38.014
And so this is the question.

00:19:38.014 --> 00:19:39.055
What is this probability?

00:19:42.210 --> 00:19:47.630
And the to get the
answer, what we do

00:19:47.630 --> 00:20:02.240
is to subdivide our
big interval into N,

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:08.130
which is big T divided by
the small dt subintervals.

00:20:13.330 --> 00:20:19.515
So basically, originally
let's say on the time axis,

00:20:19.515 --> 00:20:24.460
we were covering a distance
that went from 0 to big T

00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:27.240
and we were asking
what happens here.

00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:29.920
So what we are
doing now is we are

00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:37.320
sort of dividing this interval
to lots of subintervals,

00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:41.470
the size of each one
of them being dt.

00:20:41.470 --> 00:20:46.950
And therefore, the total
number is big T over dt.

00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:49.230
And ultimately,
clearly, I want to sit

00:20:49.230 --> 00:20:55.100
dt going to 0 so that this
condition is satisfied.

00:20:55.100 --> 00:21:00.090
So also because of the second
condition, each one of these

00:21:00.090 --> 00:21:05.220
will independently tell me
whether or not I have an event.

00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:09.190
And so if I want to count
the total number of events,

00:21:09.190 --> 00:21:11.405
I have to add things
that are occurring

00:21:11.405 --> 00:21:12.760
in different intervals.

00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:14.870
And we can see that
this problem now

00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:18.790
became identical to that
problem because each one

00:21:18.790 --> 00:21:22.450
of these intervals has two
possible outcomes-- nothing

00:21:22.450 --> 00:21:26.370
happens with probability
1 minus alpha dt,

00:21:26.370 --> 00:21:30.240
something happens with
probability alpha dt.

00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:38.210
So no event is probability
1 minus alpha dt.

00:21:38.210 --> 00:21:42.700
One event means
probability alpha dt.

00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:44.570
So this is a binomial process.

00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:55.930
So we can calculate,
for example,

00:21:55.930 --> 00:21:59.070
the characteristic function.

00:21:59.070 --> 00:22:02.510
And I will indicate
that we are looking

00:22:02.510 --> 00:22:07.440
at some interval of
size T and parameterized

00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:09.680
by this straight
alpha, we'll see

00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:11.220
that only the
product will occur.

00:22:14.610 --> 00:22:18.230
So this is this before
Fourier variable.

00:22:18.230 --> 00:22:20.190
We said that it's
a binary, so it

00:22:20.190 --> 00:22:27.420
is one of the probabilities
plus e to the minus ik

00:22:27.420 --> 00:22:31.180
plus the other probability
raised to the power of N.

00:22:31.180 --> 00:22:33.690
Now we just substitute
the probabilities that we

00:22:33.690 --> 00:22:35.350
have over here.

00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:43.810
So the probability of not having
an event is 1 minus alpha dt.

00:22:43.810 --> 00:22:47.640
The probability of having
an event is alpha dt.

00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:53.500
So alpha dt is going
to appear here as e

00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:58.440
to the minus ik minus 1.

00:22:58.440 --> 00:23:02.620
So alpha st, e to the
minus ik, is from here.

00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:06.760
From PB I will get
1 minus alpha dt.

00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:09.470
And I bunched
together the two terms

00:23:09.470 --> 00:23:13.000
that are proportional
to alpha dt.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.480
And then I have to raise
to the power of N, which

00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:17.660
is T divided by dt.

00:23:21.190 --> 00:23:26.230
And this whole prescription
is valid in the limit

00:23:26.230 --> 00:23:30.290
where dt is going to 0.

00:23:30.290 --> 00:23:35.160
So what you have is 1
plus an infinitesimal

00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:38.590
raised to a huge power.

00:23:38.590 --> 00:23:42.040
And this limiting procedure
is equivalent to taking

00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:43.530
the exponential.

00:23:43.530 --> 00:23:45.500
So basically this
is the same thing

00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:50.770
as exponential of what is here
multiplied by what is here.

00:23:50.770 --> 00:23:53.880
The dt's cancel each
other out and the answer

00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:58.670
is alpha T e to the
minus ik minus 1.

00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:05.490
So the characteristic
function for this process

00:24:05.490 --> 00:24:08.506
that we described is
simply given by this form.

00:24:20.170 --> 00:24:21.090
You say, wait.

00:24:21.090 --> 00:24:23.440
I didn't ask for the
characteristic function.

00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:25.970
I wanted the probability.

00:24:25.970 --> 00:24:27.020
Well, I say, OK.

00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:30.780
Characteristic function is
simply the Fourier transform.

00:24:30.780 --> 00:24:33.160
So let me Fourier
transform back,

00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:39.850
and I would say that the
probability along not

00:24:39.850 --> 00:24:43.210
the Fourier axis
but the actual axis

00:24:43.210 --> 00:24:45.540
is open by the inverse
Fourier process.

00:24:45.540 --> 00:24:50.120
So I have to do an
integral dk over 2 pi

00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:54.040
e to the ikx times the
characteristic function.

00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:59.510
And the characteristic function
is e to minus-- what was it?

00:24:59.510 --> 00:25:11.330
e to the alpha T. E to
the minus ik k minus 1.

00:25:15.495 --> 00:25:17.770
Well, there is an
equal to minus alpha

00:25:17.770 --> 00:25:22.280
T that I can simply take
outside the integration.

00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:27.950
I have the integration
over k e to that ikx.

00:25:31.490 --> 00:25:34.050
And then what I will do
is I have this factor of e

00:25:34.050 --> 00:25:38.783
to the something in the-- e to
the alpha T to the minus ik.

00:25:38.783 --> 00:25:42.530
I will use the expansion
of the exponential.

00:25:42.530 --> 00:25:44.420
So the expansion
of the exponential

00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:48.340
is a sum over m running
from 0 to infinity.

00:25:48.340 --> 00:25:50.840
The exponent raised
to the m-th power.

00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:54.480
So I have alpha T raised
to the m-th power,

00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:57.350
e to the minus ik raised
to the m-th power divided

00:25:57.350 --> 00:25:57.960
m factor here.

00:26:04.150 --> 00:26:09.050
So now I reorder the
sum and the integration.

00:26:09.050 --> 00:26:11.900
The sum is over m, the
integration is over k.

00:26:11.900 --> 00:26:14.200
I can reorder them.

00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:16.750
So on the things
that go outside I

00:26:16.750 --> 00:26:22.270
have a sum over m running from
0 to infinity e to the minus

00:26:22.270 --> 00:26:28.800
alpha T, alpha T to the power
of m divided by m factorial.

00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:35.790
Then I have the integral
over k over 2 pi e to the ik.

00:26:35.790 --> 00:26:40.670
Well, I had the x here and I
have e to the minus ikm here.

00:26:40.670 --> 00:26:42.610
So I have x minus m.

00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:50.970
And then I say, OK, this is
an integral that I recognize.

00:26:50.970 --> 00:26:55.420
The integral of e to
the ik times something

00:26:55.420 --> 00:26:57.940
is simply a delta function.

00:26:57.940 --> 00:27:01.940
So this whole thing
is a delta function

00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:07.320
that's says, oh, x
has to be an integer.

00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:12.430
Because I kind of did something
that maybe, in retrospect,

00:27:12.430 --> 00:27:15.130
you would have said
why are you doing this.

00:27:15.130 --> 00:27:20.600
Because along how many
times things have occurred,

00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:24.070
they have either occurred
0 times, 1 times, 2 decays,

00:27:24.070 --> 00:27:24.800
3 decays.

00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:28.040
I don't have 2.5 decays.

00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:31.630
So I treated x as a
continuous variable,

00:27:31.630 --> 00:27:35.800
but the mathematics was really
clever enough to say that, no.

00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:40.010
The only places that you can
have are really integer values.

00:27:40.010 --> 00:27:45.230
And the probability that you
have some particular value

00:27:45.230 --> 00:27:51.020
integer m is simply what we have
over here, e to the minus alpha

00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:56.954
T alpha T to the power of m
divided by m factorial, which

00:27:56.954 --> 00:27:58.120
is the Poisson distribution.

00:28:07.810 --> 00:28:08.310
OK.

00:28:13.750 --> 00:28:16.780
But fine.

00:28:16.780 --> 00:28:18.460
So this is the
Poisson distribution,

00:28:18.460 --> 00:28:21.450
but really we go
through the root

00:28:21.450 --> 00:28:24.760
of the characteristic
function in order

00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:28.430
to use this machinery
that we developed earlier

00:28:28.430 --> 00:28:31.770
for cumulants et cetera.

00:28:31.770 --> 00:28:34.620
So let's look at the
cumulant generating function.

00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:40.490
So I have to take the
log of the function

00:28:40.490 --> 00:28:43.360
that I had calculated there.

00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:46.850
It is nicely in the
exponential, so I

00:28:46.850 --> 00:28:51.950
get alpha T e to the
minus ik minus 1.

00:28:55.690 --> 00:29:01.510
So now I can make an expansion
of this in powers of k

00:29:01.510 --> 00:29:03.950
so I can expand the exponential.

00:29:03.950 --> 00:29:07.940
The first term vanishes
because this starts with one.

00:29:07.940 --> 00:29:13.440
So really I have alpha
T sum running from 1

00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:18.510
to infinity or N running
from 1 to infinity minus ik

00:29:18.510 --> 00:29:20.420
to the power of n
over n factorial.

00:29:28.230 --> 00:29:35.680
So my task for
identifying the cumulants

00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:39.210
is to look at the
expansion of this log

00:29:39.210 --> 00:29:44.510
and read off powers of minus
ikn to the power of n factorial.

00:29:44.510 --> 00:29:46.620
So what do we see?

00:29:46.620 --> 00:29:53.810
We see that the first cumulant
of the Poisson is alpha T,

00:29:53.810 --> 00:29:57.090
but all the coefficients
are the same thing.

00:29:57.090 --> 00:29:59.260
The expectation value-- sorry.

00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:03.320
The second cumulant is
alpha T. The third cumulant,

00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:06.310
the fourth cumulant,
all the other cumulants

00:30:06.310 --> 00:30:15.090
are also alpha T.

00:30:15.090 --> 00:30:19.190
So the average number of decays
that you see in the interval

00:30:19.190 --> 00:30:23.260
is simply alpha T. But
there are fluctuations,

00:30:23.260 --> 00:30:25.100
and if somebody
should, for example,

00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:30.660
ask you what's the average
number cubed of events,

00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:32.730
you would say, OK.

00:30:32.730 --> 00:30:35.750
I'm going to use the
relationship between moments

00:30:35.750 --> 00:30:37.130
and cumulants.

00:30:37.130 --> 00:30:42.830
I can either have
three first objects

00:30:42.830 --> 00:30:47.640
or I can put one of
them separate in three

00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:50.010
different factions.

00:30:50.010 --> 00:30:56.280
But this is a case where
the triangle is allowed,

00:30:56.280 --> 00:30:59.220
so diagrammatically
all three are possible.

00:30:59.220 --> 00:31:03.640
And so the answer for the
first term is alpha T cubed.

00:31:06.260 --> 00:31:09.620
For the second term,
it is a factor of 3.

00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:13.960
Both this variance and the mean
give me a factor of alpha T,

00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:17.110
so I will get alpha T squared.

00:31:17.110 --> 00:31:20.830
And the third term, which
is the third cumulant,

00:31:20.830 --> 00:31:26.163
is also alpha T. So the
answer is simply of this form.

00:31:29.550 --> 00:31:31.620
Again, m is an integer.

00:31:31.620 --> 00:31:33.330
Alpha T is dimensionless.

00:31:33.330 --> 00:31:37.985
So there is no dimension problem
by it having different powers.

00:31:42.050 --> 00:31:42.920
OK.

00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:43.550
Any questions?

00:31:50.050 --> 00:31:50.650
All right.

00:31:50.650 --> 00:31:58.010
So that's what I wanted
to say about one variable.

00:31:58.010 --> 00:32:03.685
Now let's go and look at
corresponding definitions

00:32:03.685 --> 00:32:05.060
when you have
multiple variables.

00:32:13.140 --> 00:32:27.250
So for many random variables,
the set of possible outcomes,

00:32:27.250 --> 00:32:32.650
let's say, has variables x1, x2.

00:32:32.650 --> 00:32:33.990
Let's be precise.

00:32:33.990 --> 00:32:36.440
Let's end it a xn.

00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:41.090
And if these are
distributed, each one of them

00:32:41.090 --> 00:32:45.220
continuously over the
interval, to each point

00:32:45.220 --> 00:32:50.380
we can characterize some kind
of a probability density.

00:32:50.380 --> 00:32:57.940
So this entity is called the
joint probability density

00:32:57.940 --> 00:33:00.630
function.

00:33:00.630 --> 00:33:14.950
And its definition would be to
look at probability of outcome

00:33:14.950 --> 00:33:22.360
in some interval that
is between, say, x1, x1

00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:30.770
plus dx1 in one, x2, x2 plus
dx2 in the second variable.

00:33:30.770 --> 00:33:36.750
xn plus dxn in
the last variable.

00:33:36.750 --> 00:33:40.560
So you sort of look at
the particular point

00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:44.420
in this multi-dimensional
space that you are interested.

00:33:44.420 --> 00:33:48.340
You build a little
cube around it.

00:33:48.340 --> 00:33:51.580
You ask, what's the
probability to being that cube?

00:33:51.580 --> 00:33:55.420
And then you divide by
the volume of that cube.

00:33:55.420 --> 00:34:01.960
So dx1, dx2, dxn,
which is the same thing

00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:06.530
that you would be doing in
constructing any density

00:34:06.530 --> 00:34:10.719
and by ultimately taking the
limit that all of the x's

00:34:10.719 --> 00:34:11.688
go to 0.

00:34:21.250 --> 00:34:22.060
All right.

00:34:22.060 --> 00:34:26.469
So this is the joint
probability distribution.

00:34:26.469 --> 00:34:30.739
You can construct, now, the
joint characteristic function.

00:34:44.319 --> 00:34:45.740
Now how do you do that?

00:34:45.740 --> 00:34:49.190
Well, again, just like you
would do for your transform

00:34:49.190 --> 00:34:52.030
with multiple variables.

00:34:52.030 --> 00:34:56.510
So you would go
for each variable

00:34:56.510 --> 00:34:58.310
to a conjugate variable.

00:34:58.310 --> 00:35:00.810
So x1 would go to k1.

00:35:00.810 --> 00:35:02.990
x2 would go to k2.

00:35:02.990 --> 00:35:05.330
xn would go to kn.

00:35:05.330 --> 00:35:08.600
And this would
mathematically amount

00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:11.670
to calculating the
expectation value of e

00:35:11.670 --> 00:35:26.470
to the minus i k1x1 x1,
k2x2 and so forth, which

00:35:26.470 --> 00:35:38.850
you would obtain by integrating
over all of these variables, e

00:35:38.850 --> 00:35:46.280
to the minus ik alpha x alpha,
against the probability of x1

00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:47.106
through xn.

00:35:53.140 --> 00:35:53.640
Question?

00:35:57.966 --> 00:35:59.775
AUDIENCE: It's a
bit hard to read.

00:35:59.775 --> 00:36:00.858
It's getting really small.

00:36:04.475 --> 00:36:07.856
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:36:07.856 --> 00:36:10.271
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:15.020
PROFESSOR: But it's just
multi-dimensional integral.

00:36:15.020 --> 00:36:17.080
OK?

00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:18.550
All right.

00:36:18.550 --> 00:36:25.270
So this is, as
the case of one, I

00:36:25.270 --> 00:36:29.540
think the problem is not the
size but the angle I see.

00:36:29.540 --> 00:36:30.875
I can't do much for that.

00:36:30.875 --> 00:36:34.310
You have to move to the center.

00:36:34.310 --> 00:36:34.820
OK.

00:36:34.820 --> 00:36:40.600
So what we can look at
now is joint moment.

00:36:46.310 --> 00:36:50.350
So you can-- when
we had one variable,

00:36:50.350 --> 00:36:52.970
we could look at something
like the expectation

00:36:52.970 --> 00:36:54.490
value of x to the m.

00:36:57.890 --> 00:37:00.990
That would be the m-th moment.

00:37:00.990 --> 00:37:04.270
But if you have two
variable, we can raise x1

00:37:04.270 --> 00:37:08.270
to some other, x2
to another power,

00:37:08.270 --> 00:37:12.430
and actually xn
to another power.

00:37:12.430 --> 00:37:13.980
So this is a joint moment.

00:37:18.310 --> 00:37:23.310
Now the thing is, that
the same way that moments

00:37:23.310 --> 00:37:25.500
for one variable
could be generated

00:37:25.500 --> 00:37:28.770
by expanding the
characteristic function,

00:37:28.770 --> 00:37:32.380
if I were to expand this
function in powers of k,

00:37:32.380 --> 00:37:35.820
you can see that in meeting
the expectation value,

00:37:35.820 --> 00:37:38.840
I will get various powers
of x1 to some power,

00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:41.400
x2 to some power, et cetera.

00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:44.550
So by appropriate
expansion of that function,

00:37:44.550 --> 00:37:49.200
I can generate all of-- read
off all of these moments.

00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:53.650
Now, a more common way of
generating the Taylor series

00:37:53.650 --> 00:37:56.620
expansion is
through derivatives.

00:37:56.620 --> 00:38:02.810
So what I can do is I can
take a derivative with respect

00:38:02.810 --> 00:38:03.860
to, say, ik1.

00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:11.340
If I take a derivative
with respect

00:38:11.340 --> 00:38:14.580
to ik1 here, what happens
is I will bring down

00:38:14.580 --> 00:38:16.490
a factor of minus x alpha.

00:38:16.490 --> 00:38:19.420
So actually let me
put the minus so it

00:38:19.420 --> 00:38:22.340
becomes a factor of x alpha.

00:38:22.340 --> 00:38:29.060
And if I integrate x
alpha against this,

00:38:29.060 --> 00:38:31.620
I will be generating
the expectation value

00:38:31.620 --> 00:38:37.990
of x alpha provided that
ultimately I set all of the k's

00:38:37.990 --> 00:38:38.990
to 0.

00:38:38.990 --> 00:38:41.080
So I will calculate
the derivative

00:38:41.080 --> 00:38:45.160
of this function with respect
to all of these arguments.

00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:48.170
At the end of the day, I
will set k equals to 0.

00:38:48.170 --> 00:38:51.720
That will give me the
expectation value of x1.

00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:57.550
But I don't want x1, I want
x1 raised to the power of m1.

00:38:57.550 --> 00:38:59.130
So I do this.

00:38:59.130 --> 00:39:02.590
Each time I take a derivative
with respect to minus ik,

00:39:02.590 --> 00:39:06.720
I will bring down the factor
of the corresponding x.

00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:10.240
And I can do this with
multiple different things.

00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:17.120
So d by the ik2 raised
to the power of m2

00:39:17.120 --> 00:39:23.310
minus d by the ikn,
the whole thing

00:39:23.310 --> 00:39:26.580
raised to the power of mn.

00:39:29.650 --> 00:39:32.560
So I can either
take this function

00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:35.430
of multiple variables--
k1 through kn--

00:39:35.430 --> 00:39:39.620
and expand it and read off the
appropriate powers of k1k2.

00:39:39.620 --> 00:39:43.090
Or I can say that the
terms in this expansion

00:39:43.090 --> 00:39:45.830
are generated through taking
appropriate derivative.

00:39:45.830 --> 00:39:47.145
Yes?

00:39:47.145 --> 00:39:48.520
AUDIENCE: Is there
any reason why

00:39:48.520 --> 00:39:52.810
you're choosing to take
a derivative with respect

00:39:52.810 --> 00:39:57.406
to ikj instead of simply
putting the i in the numerator?

00:39:57.406 --> 00:39:59.641
Or are there-- are there
things that I'm not--

00:39:59.641 --> 00:40:00.600
PROFESSOR: No.

00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:01.100
No.

00:40:01.100 --> 00:40:01.950
There is no reason.

00:40:01.950 --> 00:40:05.341
So you're saying why didn't I
write this as this like this?

00:40:05.341 --> 00:40:05.840
i divided?

00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:07.585
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:40:07.585 --> 00:40:10.230
PROFESSOR: I think
I just visually saw

00:40:10.230 --> 00:40:13.830
that it was kind
of more that way.

00:40:13.830 --> 00:40:15.420
But it's exactly the same thing.

00:40:15.420 --> 00:40:18.266
Yes.

00:40:18.266 --> 00:40:18.766
OK.

00:40:22.660 --> 00:40:25.460
All right.

00:40:25.460 --> 00:40:27.930
Now the interesting
object, of course, to us

00:40:27.930 --> 00:40:29.820
is more the joint cumulants.

00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:39.270
So how do we generate
joint cumulants?

00:40:39.270 --> 00:40:44.310
Well previously, essentially
we had a bunch of objects

00:40:44.310 --> 00:40:48.830
for one variable
that was some moment.

00:40:48.830 --> 00:40:50.770
And in order to
make them cumulants,

00:40:50.770 --> 00:40:52.540
we just put a sub C here.

00:40:52.540 --> 00:40:55.390
So we do that and we are done.

00:40:55.390 --> 00:40:58.390
But what did
operationally happen

00:40:58.390 --> 00:41:01.990
was that we did the
expansion rather

00:41:01.990 --> 00:41:04.400
than for the
characteristic function

00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:08.430
for the log of the
characteristic function.

00:41:08.430 --> 00:41:12.630
So all I need to do
is to do precisely

00:41:12.630 --> 00:41:17.120
this set of derivatives
applied rather

00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:21.290
than to the joint
characteristic function

00:41:21.290 --> 00:41:24.260
to the log of the joint
characteristic function.

00:41:24.260 --> 00:41:27.849
And at the end, set
all of the case to 0.

00:41:30.702 --> 00:41:31.202
OK?

00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:47.650
So by looking at these two
definitions and the expansion

00:41:47.650 --> 00:41:51.580
of the log, for example, you
can calculate various things.

00:41:51.580 --> 00:42:00.730
Like, for example, x1x2 with
a C is the expectation value

00:42:00.730 --> 00:42:03.440
of x1x2.

00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:13.600
This joint moment minus x1x2,
just as you would have thought,

00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:17.710
would be the appropriate
generalization of the variance.

00:42:17.710 --> 00:42:18.835
And this is the covariance.

00:42:23.360 --> 00:42:28.560
And you can construct
appropriate extensions.

00:42:28.560 --> 00:42:29.060
OK.

00:42:43.410 --> 00:42:50.967
Now we made a lot of use of the
relationship between moments

00:42:50.967 --> 00:42:51.550
and cumulants.

00:42:51.550 --> 00:42:54.560
We just-- so the
idea, really, was

00:42:54.560 --> 00:42:58.110
that the essence of a
probability distribution

00:42:58.110 --> 00:43:01.030
is characterized
in the cumulants.

00:43:01.030 --> 00:43:03.910
Moments kind of depend on
how you look at things.

00:43:03.910 --> 00:43:07.040
The essence is in the cumulants,
but sometimes the moments

00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:10.020
are more usefully
computed, and there

00:43:10.020 --> 00:43:13.120
was a relationship between
moments and cumulants,

00:43:13.120 --> 00:43:16.025
we can generalize that
graphical relation

00:43:16.025 --> 00:43:19.640
to the case joint moments
and joint cumulants.

00:43:19.640 --> 00:43:29.120
So graphical relation
applies as long

00:43:29.120 --> 00:43:39.490
as points are labeled
by appropriate

00:43:39.490 --> 00:43:45.040
or by corresponding variable.

00:43:49.790 --> 00:43:55.970
So suppose I wanted to calculate
some kind of a moment that

00:43:55.970 --> 00:43:58.780
is x1 squared.

00:43:58.780 --> 00:44:05.490
Let's say x2, x3.

00:44:05.490 --> 00:44:07.480
This may generate
for me many diagrams,

00:44:07.480 --> 00:44:11.180
so let's stop from here.

00:44:11.180 --> 00:44:15.820
So what I can do is
I can have points

00:44:15.820 --> 00:44:20.150
that I label 1, 1, and 2.

00:44:20.150 --> 00:44:24.100
And have them separate
from each other.

00:44:24.100 --> 00:44:27.800
Or I can start
pairing them together.

00:44:27.800 --> 00:44:33.000
So one possibility is that I
put the 1's together and the 2

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:36.380
starts separately.

00:44:36.380 --> 00:44:40.470
Another possibility is that
I can group the 1 and the 2

00:44:40.470 --> 00:44:42.410
together.

00:44:42.410 --> 00:44:46.500
And then the other
1 starts separately.

00:44:46.500 --> 00:44:48.860
But I had a choice of
two ways to do this,

00:44:48.860 --> 00:44:53.180
so this comes-- this diagram
with an overall factor of 2.

00:44:53.180 --> 00:44:58.770
And then there's the
possibility to put all of them

00:44:58.770 --> 00:45:01.022
in the same bag.

00:45:01.022 --> 00:45:03.420
And so mathematically,
that means

00:45:03.420 --> 00:45:08.610
that the third-- this
particular joint moment

00:45:08.610 --> 00:45:17.880
is obtained by taking average
of x1 squared x2 average, which

00:45:17.880 --> 00:45:20.030
is the first term.

00:45:20.030 --> 00:45:26.450
The second term is
the variance of x1.

00:45:26.450 --> 00:45:28.440
And then multiplied by x2.

00:45:32.030 --> 00:45:40.060
The third term is twice the
covariance of x1 and x2 times

00:45:40.060 --> 00:45:42.017
the mean of x1.

00:45:45.960 --> 00:45:49.610
And the final term is
just the third cumulant.

00:45:53.034 --> 00:45:57.980
So again, you would need to
compute these, presumably,

00:45:57.980 --> 00:46:00.200
from the law of the
characteristic function

00:46:00.200 --> 00:46:01.934
and then you would be done.

00:46:27.790 --> 00:46:32.780
Couple of other definitions.

00:46:32.780 --> 00:46:42.150
One of them is an
unconditional probability.

00:46:44.710 --> 00:46:49.960
So very soon we will be talking
about, say, probabilities

00:46:49.960 --> 00:46:52.470
appropriate to the
gas in this room.

00:46:52.470 --> 00:46:54.780
And the particles in
the gas in this room

00:46:54.780 --> 00:46:58.020
will be characterized
where they are,

00:46:58.020 --> 00:47:02.700
some position vector q, and
how fast they are moving,

00:47:02.700 --> 00:47:05.210
some momentum vector p.

00:47:05.210 --> 00:47:08.950
And there would be some kind
of a probability density

00:47:08.950 --> 00:47:13.750
associated with finding a
particle with some momentum

00:47:13.750 --> 00:47:17.120
at some location in space.

00:47:17.120 --> 00:47:20.650
But sometimes I
say, well, I really

00:47:20.650 --> 00:47:23.370
don't care about where
the particles are,

00:47:23.370 --> 00:47:27.140
I just want to know how
fast they are moving.

00:47:27.140 --> 00:47:31.610
So what I really care
is the probability

00:47:31.610 --> 00:47:35.180
that I have a particle
moving with some momentum p,

00:47:35.180 --> 00:47:38.160
irrespective of where it is.

00:47:38.160 --> 00:47:42.120
Then all I need to
do is to integrate

00:47:42.120 --> 00:47:45.545
over the position the joint
probability distribution.

00:47:48.230 --> 00:47:50.560
And the check that
this is correct

00:47:50.560 --> 00:47:54.360
is that if I first do not
integrate this over p,

00:47:54.360 --> 00:47:57.570
this would be integrated
over the entire space

00:47:57.570 --> 00:47:59.930
and the joint
probabilities appropriately

00:47:59.930 --> 00:48:04.630
normalized so that the joint
integration will give me one.

00:48:04.630 --> 00:48:09.400
So this is a correct
normalized probability.

00:48:09.400 --> 00:48:14.930
And more generally, if I'm
interested in, say, a bunch of

00:48:14.930 --> 00:48:21.540
coordinates x1 through xs, out
of a larger list of coordinates

00:48:21.540 --> 00:48:29.510
that spans x1 through xs all
the way to something else,

00:48:29.510 --> 00:48:34.350
all I need to do to get
unconditional probability is

00:48:34.350 --> 00:48:39.770
to integrate over the variables
that I'm not interested.

00:48:39.770 --> 00:48:43.800
Again, check is that it's
a good properly normalized.

00:48:46.660 --> 00:48:48.880
Now, this is to
be contrasted with

00:48:48.880 --> 00:48:50.210
the conditional probability.

00:48:55.470 --> 00:48:58.440
The conditional
probability, let's

00:48:58.440 --> 00:49:02.955
say we would be interested in
calculating the pressure that

00:49:02.955 --> 00:49:05.110
is exerted on the board.

00:49:05.110 --> 00:49:07.680
The pressure is exerted
by the particles that

00:49:07.680 --> 00:49:10.340
impinge on the board
and then go away,

00:49:10.340 --> 00:49:13.620
so I'm interested in the
momentum of particles

00:49:13.620 --> 00:49:17.290
right at the board, not
anywhere else in space.

00:49:17.290 --> 00:49:23.760
So if I'm interested in
the momentum of particles

00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:28.870
at the particular location,
which could in principle depend

00:49:28.870 --> 00:49:36.440
on location-- so now q is a
parameter p is the variable,

00:49:36.440 --> 00:49:41.010
but the probability
distribution could depend on q.

00:49:41.010 --> 00:49:43.020
How do we obtain this?

00:49:43.020 --> 00:49:43.870
This, again.

00:49:43.870 --> 00:49:48.330
is going to be proportional
to the probability

00:49:48.330 --> 00:49:50.650
that I will find
a particle both at

00:49:50.650 --> 00:49:53.430
this location with momentum p.

00:49:53.430 --> 00:49:56.480
So I need to have that.

00:49:56.480 --> 00:49:58.180
But it's not
exactly that there's

00:49:58.180 --> 00:50:01.310
a normalization involved.

00:50:01.310 --> 00:50:04.210
And the way to get
normalization is

00:50:04.210 --> 00:50:13.590
to note that if I integrate this
probability over its variable p

00:50:13.590 --> 00:50:24.050
but not over the parameter
q, the answer should be 1.

00:50:24.050 --> 00:50:27.320
So this is going to
be, if I apply it

00:50:27.320 --> 00:50:32.760
to the right-hand side,
the integral over p

00:50:32.760 --> 00:50:39.850
of p of p and q,
which we recognize

00:50:39.850 --> 00:50:44.470
as an example of an
unconditional probability

00:50:44.470 --> 00:50:48.970
to find something at position 1.

00:50:48.970 --> 00:50:55.480
So the normalization is going to
be this so that the ratio is 1.

00:50:55.480 --> 00:51:02.070
So most generally, we
find that the probability

00:51:02.070 --> 00:51:08.610
to have some subset
of variables, given

00:51:08.610 --> 00:51:12.930
that the location of the
other variables in the list

00:51:12.930 --> 00:51:19.110
are somewhat fixed, is given
by the joint probability of all

00:51:19.110 --> 00:51:24.970
of the variables x1
through xn divided

00:51:24.970 --> 00:51:29.290
by the unconditional
probability that that applies

00:51:29.290 --> 00:51:31.530
to the parameters of our fixed.

00:51:35.844 --> 00:51:37.260
And this is called
Bayes' theorem.

00:51:57.510 --> 00:52:05.240
By the way, if variables
are independent,

00:52:05.240 --> 00:52:08.340
which actually does apply
to the case of the particles

00:52:08.340 --> 00:52:11.300
in this room as far as their
momentum and position is

00:52:11.300 --> 00:52:15.900
concerned, then the
joint probability

00:52:15.900 --> 00:52:18.190
is going to be the
product of one that

00:52:18.190 --> 00:52:20.950
is appropriate to
the position and one

00:52:20.950 --> 00:52:22.535
that is appropriate
to the momentum.

00:52:25.990 --> 00:52:29.050
And if you have
this independence,

00:52:29.050 --> 00:52:31.835
then what you'll
find is that there

00:52:31.835 --> 00:52:34.730
is no difference between
conditional and unconditional

00:52:34.730 --> 00:52:36.460
probabilities.

00:52:36.460 --> 00:52:38.610
And when you go
through this procedure,

00:52:38.610 --> 00:52:42.110
you will find that all the
joint cumulants-- but not

00:52:42.110 --> 00:52:44.780
the joint moments, naturally--
all the joint cumulants

00:52:44.780 --> 00:52:45.748
will be 0.

00:52:52.050 --> 00:52:52.800
OK.

00:52:52.800 --> 00:52:53.985
Any questions?

00:52:53.985 --> 00:52:54.485
Yes?

00:52:54.485 --> 00:53:00.286
AUDIENCE: Could you explain
how the condition of p--

00:53:00.286 --> 00:53:03.200
PROFESSOR: How
this was obtained?

00:53:03.200 --> 00:53:04.180
Or the one above?

00:53:04.180 --> 00:53:05.164
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:53:05.164 --> 00:53:07.624
The condition you applied
that the integral is 1.

00:53:07.624 --> 00:53:08.960
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:53:08.960 --> 00:53:14.950
So first of all, what
I want to look at

00:53:14.950 --> 00:53:18.580
is the probability that
is appropriate to one

00:53:18.580 --> 00:53:22.240
random variable at
the fixed value of all

00:53:22.240 --> 00:53:24.050
the other random variables.

00:53:24.050 --> 00:53:27.890
Like you say, in general I
should specify the probability

00:53:27.890 --> 00:53:31.110
as a function of momentum and
position throughout space.

00:53:31.110 --> 00:53:33.790
But I'm really interested
only at this point.

00:53:33.790 --> 00:53:37.730
I don't really care
about other points.

00:53:37.730 --> 00:53:40.820
However, the answer may depend
whether I'm looking at here

00:53:40.820 --> 00:53:42.640
or I'm looking at here.

00:53:42.640 --> 00:53:45.410
So the answer for the
probability of momentum

00:53:45.410 --> 00:53:47.710
is parametrized by q.

00:53:47.710 --> 00:53:50.760
On the other hand,
I say that I know

00:53:50.760 --> 00:53:53.370
the probability over
the entire space

00:53:53.370 --> 00:53:56.270
to be a disposition
with the momentum p

00:53:56.270 --> 00:53:59.720
as given by this
joint probability.

00:53:59.720 --> 00:54:02.580
But if I just set
that equal to this,

00:54:02.580 --> 00:54:05.820
the answer is not
correct because the way

00:54:05.820 --> 00:54:10.570
that this quantity is normalized
is if I first integrate over

00:54:10.570 --> 00:54:15.170
all possible values
of its variable, p.

00:54:15.170 --> 00:54:20.200
The answer should be 1,
irrespective of what q is.

00:54:20.200 --> 00:54:24.870
So I can define a conditional
probability for momentum

00:54:24.870 --> 00:54:28.630
here, a conditional
probability for momentum there.

00:54:28.630 --> 00:54:32.600
In both cases the momentum
would be the variable it.

00:54:32.600 --> 00:54:36.230
And integrating over all
possible values of momentum

00:54:36.230 --> 00:54:39.430
should give me one for a
properly normalized probability

00:54:39.430 --> 00:54:40.120
distribution.

00:54:40.120 --> 00:54:42.575
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:54:42.575 --> 00:54:44.700
PROFESSOR: Given
that q is something.

00:54:44.700 --> 00:54:48.510
So q could be some--
now here q can

00:54:48.510 --> 00:54:51.050
be regarded as some parameter.

00:54:51.050 --> 00:54:55.680
So the condition is that this
integration should give me 1.

00:54:55.680 --> 00:54:57.630
I said that on
physical grounds, I

00:54:57.630 --> 00:55:00.660
expect this
conditional probability

00:55:00.660 --> 00:55:03.820
to be the joint probability
up to some normalization

00:55:03.820 --> 00:55:06.270
that I don't know.

00:55:06.270 --> 00:55:06.770
OK.

00:55:06.770 --> 00:55:09.390
So what is that normalization?

00:55:09.390 --> 00:55:11.890
The whole answer should be 1.

00:55:11.890 --> 00:55:13.820
What I have to do
is an integration

00:55:13.820 --> 00:55:17.380
over momentum of the
joint probability.

00:55:17.380 --> 00:55:22.845
I have said that an integration
over some set of variables

00:55:22.845 --> 00:55:25.070
of a joint probability
will give me

00:55:25.070 --> 00:55:28.860
the unconditional probability
for all the others.

00:55:28.860 --> 00:55:32.860
So integrating over all momentum
of this joint probability

00:55:32.860 --> 00:55:37.310
will give me the unconditional
probability for position.

00:55:37.310 --> 00:55:41.550
So the normalization of 1 is
the unconditional probability

00:55:41.550 --> 00:55:44.220
for position divided by n.

00:55:44.220 --> 00:55:48.220
So n-- this has to be this.

00:55:48.220 --> 00:55:53.200
And in general, it would
have to be this in order

00:55:53.200 --> 00:55:55.370
to ensure that if
I integrate over

00:55:55.370 --> 00:55:59.180
this first set of variables
of the joint probability

00:55:59.180 --> 00:56:04.040
distribution which would
give me the unconditional,

00:56:04.040 --> 00:56:07.090
cancels the unconditional in
the denominator to give me 1.

00:56:15.324 --> 00:56:15.990
Other questions?

00:56:20.900 --> 00:56:22.290
OK.

00:56:22.290 --> 00:56:28.980
So I'm going to
erase this last board

00:56:28.980 --> 00:56:35.530
to be underneath that
top board in looking

00:56:35.530 --> 00:56:40.140
at the joint Gaussian
distribution.

00:56:40.140 --> 00:56:41.950
So that was the
Gaussian, and we want

00:56:41.950 --> 00:56:43.290
to look at the joint Gaussian.

00:56:53.950 --> 00:56:57.440
So we want to
generalize the formula

00:56:57.440 --> 00:57:01.855
that we have over there for one
variable to multiple variables.

00:57:05.160 --> 00:57:09.200
So what I have there
initially is a factor, which

00:57:09.200 --> 00:57:23.530
is exponential of minus
1/2, x minus lambda squared.

00:57:23.530 --> 00:57:26.060
I can write this x
minus lambda squared

00:57:26.060 --> 00:57:29.680
as x minus lambda
x minus lambda.

00:57:29.680 --> 00:57:33.040
And then put the variance.

00:57:33.040 --> 00:57:39.850
Let's call it is 1 over sigma
rather than a small sigma

00:57:39.850 --> 00:57:42.141
squared or something like this.

00:57:42.141 --> 00:57:43.780
Actually, let me
just write it as 1

00:57:43.780 --> 00:57:46.110
over sigma squared
for the time being.

00:57:46.110 --> 00:57:53.480
And then the normalization was
1 over root 2 pi sigma squared.

00:57:53.480 --> 00:57:55.690
But you say, well, I
have multiple variables,

00:57:55.690 --> 00:57:59.080
so maybe this is what I
would give for my B variable.

00:58:04.090 --> 00:58:10.410
And then I would sum over
all N, running from 1 to N.

00:58:10.410 --> 00:58:12.470
So this is essentially
the form that I

00:58:12.470 --> 00:58:18.240
would have for an independent
Gaussian variables.

00:58:18.240 --> 00:58:21.570
And then I would
have to multiply here

00:58:21.570 --> 00:58:25.990
factors of 2 pi sigma squared,
so I would have 2 pi to the N

00:58:25.990 --> 00:58:27.190
over 2.

00:58:27.190 --> 00:58:30.710
And I would have
product of-- actually,

00:58:30.710 --> 00:58:34.370
let's write it as 2 pi
to the N square root.

00:58:34.370 --> 00:58:36.400
I would have the product
of sigma i squared.

00:58:40.890 --> 00:58:44.770
But that's just too
limiting a form.

00:58:44.770 --> 00:58:50.700
The most general form that these
quadratic will allow me to have

00:58:50.700 --> 00:58:55.980
also cross terms where it is
not only the diagonal terms

00:58:55.980 --> 00:58:59.950
x1 and x1 that's are multiplying
each other, but x2 and x3,

00:58:59.950 --> 00:59:01.140
et cetera.

00:59:01.140 --> 00:59:07.070
So I would have a sum over both
m and n running from 1 to n.

00:59:07.070 --> 00:59:09.040
And then to coefficient
here, rather

00:59:09.040 --> 00:59:14.890
than just being a number,
would be the variables

00:59:14.890 --> 00:59:18.520
that would be like a matrix.

00:59:18.520 --> 00:59:25.070
Because for each pair m and
n, I would have some number.

00:59:25.070 --> 00:59:32.420
And I will call them the
inverse of some matrix C.

00:59:32.420 --> 00:59:37.710
And if you, again, think
of the problem as a matrix,

00:59:37.710 --> 00:59:41.440
if I have the diagonal
matrix, then the product

00:59:41.440 --> 00:59:43.990
of elements along the
diagonal is the same thing

00:59:43.990 --> 00:59:45.740
as the determinant.

00:59:45.740 --> 00:59:49.780
If I were to rotate the matrix
to have off diagonal elements,

00:59:49.780 --> 00:59:52.752
the determinant will
always be there.

00:59:52.752 --> 00:59:56.365
So this is really
the determinant of C

00:59:56.365 --> 00:59:57.610
that will appear here.

01:00:00.420 --> 01:00:01.220
Yes?

01:00:01.220 --> 01:00:07.045
AUDIENCE: So are you inverting
the individual elements of C

01:00:07.045 --> 01:00:11.180
or are you inverting the matrix
C and taking its elements?

01:00:11.180 --> 01:00:14.940
PROFESSOR: Actually
a very good point.

01:00:14.940 --> 01:00:19.780
I really wanted to write it
as the inverse of the matrix

01:00:19.780 --> 01:00:22.350
and then peak the
mn [INAUDIBLE].

01:00:22.350 --> 01:00:25.890
So we imagine that
we have the matrix.

01:00:25.890 --> 01:00:30.960
And these are the
elements of some--

01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:33.730
so I could have called
this whatever I want.

01:00:33.730 --> 01:00:37.150
So I could have called the
coefficients of x and n.

01:00:37.150 --> 01:00:44.610
I have chosen to regard
them as the inverse

01:00:44.610 --> 01:00:48.260
of some other matrix C.
And the reason for that

01:00:48.260 --> 01:00:52.350
becomes shortly clear,
because the covariances will

01:00:52.350 --> 01:00:55.240
be related to the
inverse of this matrix.

01:00:55.240 --> 01:00:58.731
And hence, that's the
appropriate way to look at it.

01:00:58.731 --> 01:01:00.730
AUDIENCE: Can [INAUDIBLE]
what C means up there?

01:01:00.730 --> 01:01:02.030
PROFESSOR: OK.

01:01:02.030 --> 01:01:05.845
So let's forget
about this lambdas.

01:01:05.845 --> 01:01:09.080
So I would have in
general for two variables

01:01:09.080 --> 01:01:12.640
some coefficient for x1
squared, some coefficient

01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:17.730
for x2 squared, and some
coefficient for x1, x2.

01:01:17.730 --> 01:01:21.070
So I could call this a11.

01:01:21.070 --> 01:01:23.580
I could call this a22.

01:01:23.580 --> 01:01:26.430
I could call this 2a12.

01:01:26.430 --> 01:01:28.550
Or actually I
could, if I wanted,

01:01:28.550 --> 01:01:33.250
just write it as
a12 plus a21 x2x1

01:01:33.250 --> 01:01:36.930
or do a1 to an a21
would be the same.

01:01:36.930 --> 01:01:42.350
So what I could then
regard this is as x1 2.

01:01:42.350 --> 01:01:50.440
The matrix a11, a12,
a21, a22, x1, x2.

01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:54.304
So this is exactly
the same as that.

01:01:54.304 --> 01:01:55.570
All right?

01:01:55.570 --> 01:02:01.490
So these objects
here are the elements

01:02:01.490 --> 01:02:04.330
of this matrix C inverse.

01:02:04.330 --> 01:02:12.790
So I could call this x1,
x2 some matrix A x1 x2.

01:02:12.790 --> 01:02:14.990
That A is 2 by 2 matrix.

01:02:14.990 --> 01:02:19.080
The name I have given to that
2 by 2 matrix in C inverse.

01:02:23.160 --> 01:02:23.660
Yes?

01:02:23.660 --> 01:02:25.404
AUDIENCE: The matrix
is required to be

01:02:25.404 --> 01:02:25.840
symmetric though, isn't it?

01:02:25.840 --> 01:02:27.360
PROFESSOR: The
matrix is required

01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:29.450
to be symmetric for
any quadrant form.

01:02:29.450 --> 01:02:30.270
Yes.

01:02:30.270 --> 01:02:33.920
So when I wrote it
initially, I wrote as 2 a12.

01:02:33.920 --> 01:02:36.410
And then I said, well,
I can also write it

01:02:36.410 --> 01:02:38.730
this fashion provided the
two of them are the same.

01:02:38.730 --> 01:02:39.230
Yes?

01:02:39.230 --> 01:02:42.150
AUDIENCE: How did you know
the determinant of C belonged

01:02:42.150 --> 01:02:42.650
there?

01:02:42.650 --> 01:02:43.380
PROFESSOR: Pardon?

01:02:43.380 --> 01:02:45.020
AUDIENCE: How did you
know that the determinant

01:02:45.020 --> 01:02:45.545
of C [INAUDIBLE]?

01:02:45.545 --> 01:02:46.128
PROFESSOR: OK.

01:02:46.128 --> 01:02:48.190
How do I know the
determinant of C?

01:02:48.190 --> 01:02:51.330
Let's say I give you this form.

01:02:51.330 --> 01:02:55.270
And then I don't know
what the normalization is.

01:02:55.270 --> 01:03:00.390
What I can do is I can do a
change of variables from x1 x2

01:03:00.390 --> 01:03:06.690
to something like y1 y2 such
that when I look at y1 and y2,

01:03:06.690 --> 01:03:10.220
the matrix becomes diagonal.

01:03:10.220 --> 01:03:13.130
So I can rotate the matrix.

01:03:13.130 --> 01:03:18.730
So any matrix I can imagine
that I will find some U such

01:03:18.730 --> 01:03:24.870
that A U U dagger is this
diagonal matrix lambda.

01:03:24.870 --> 01:03:29.370
Now under these procedures,
one thing that does not change

01:03:29.370 --> 01:03:30.970
is the determinant.

01:03:30.970 --> 01:03:34.290
It's always the product
of the eigenvalues.

01:03:34.290 --> 01:03:35.980
The way that I set
up the problem,

01:03:35.980 --> 01:03:41.480
I said that if I hadn't made
the problem to have cross terms,

01:03:41.480 --> 01:03:45.560
I knew the answers to be the
product of that eigenvalues.

01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:49.870
So if you like, I can start from
there and then do a rotation

01:03:49.870 --> 01:03:52.350
and have the more general form.

01:03:52.350 --> 01:03:54.800
The answer would stay
as the determinant.

01:03:54.800 --> 01:03:55.571
Yes?

01:03:55.571 --> 01:03:57.820
AUDIENCE: The matrix should
be positive as well or no?

01:03:57.820 --> 01:04:00.490
PROFESSOR: The matrix should
be positive definite in order

01:04:00.490 --> 01:04:04.620
for the probability to be
well-defined and exist, yes.

01:04:04.620 --> 01:04:06.090
OK.

01:04:06.090 --> 01:04:10.380
So if you like, by stating
that this is a probability,

01:04:10.380 --> 01:04:12.650
I have imposed a
number of conditions

01:04:12.650 --> 01:04:15.560
such as symmetry, as
well as positivity.

01:04:18.310 --> 01:04:20.750
Yes.

01:04:20.750 --> 01:04:23.337
OK.

01:04:23.337 --> 01:04:24.670
But this is just linear algebra.

01:04:29.460 --> 01:04:31.929
I will assume that you
know linear algebra.

01:04:34.710 --> 01:04:35.500
OK.

01:04:35.500 --> 01:04:40.790
So this property normalized
Gaussian joint probability.

01:04:40.790 --> 01:04:44.570
We are interested in the
characteristic function.

01:04:44.570 --> 01:04:48.256
So what we are interested is the
joint Gaussian characteristic.

01:04:54.640 --> 01:04:58.010
And so again we
saw the procedure

01:04:58.010 --> 01:05:00.636
was that I have to do
the Fourier transform.

01:05:05.200 --> 01:05:08.660
So I have to take this
probability that I

01:05:08.660 --> 01:05:13.600
have over there and do
an integration product,

01:05:13.600 --> 01:05:17.470
say, alpha running
from 1 to N dx

01:05:17.470 --> 01:05:27.750
alpha of e to the
minus ik alpha x alpha.

01:05:27.750 --> 01:05:31.620
This product exists
for all values.

01:05:31.620 --> 01:05:34.810
Then I have to multiply
with this probability

01:05:34.810 --> 01:05:37.220
that I have up there,
which would appear here.

01:05:41.339 --> 01:05:41.839
OK.

01:05:44.730 --> 01:05:49.570
Now, again maybe an
easy way to imagine

01:05:49.570 --> 01:05:52.420
is what I was saying
to previously.

01:05:52.420 --> 01:05:54.880
Let's imagine that
I have rotated

01:05:54.880 --> 01:05:59.260
into a basis where
everything is diagonal.

01:05:59.260 --> 01:06:03.350
Then in the rotated
basis, all you need to do

01:06:03.350 --> 01:06:11.980
is to essentially do product
of characteristic functions

01:06:11.980 --> 01:06:14.680
such as what we have over here.

01:06:14.680 --> 01:06:20.560
So the corresponding
product to this first term

01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:26.250
would be exponential of
minus i sum over N running

01:06:26.250 --> 01:06:29.640
from 1 to N k
alpha lambda alpha.

01:06:32.910 --> 01:06:34.440
kn lambda n.

01:06:34.440 --> 01:06:39.140
I guess I'm using n
as the variable here.

01:06:39.140 --> 01:06:43.440
And as long as things
would be diagonal,

01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:46.670
the next ordered
term would be a sum

01:06:46.670 --> 01:06:52.260
over alpha kn squared the
corresponding eigenvalue

01:06:52.260 --> 01:06:54.790
inverted.

01:06:54.790 --> 01:07:00.560
So remember that in the diagonal
form, each one of these sigmas

01:07:00.560 --> 01:07:03.690
would appear as the diagonal.

01:07:03.690 --> 01:07:07.950
If I do my rotation,
essentially this term

01:07:07.950 --> 01:07:10.180
would not be affected.

01:07:10.180 --> 01:07:15.180
The next term would give me
minus 1/2 sum over m and n

01:07:15.180 --> 01:07:19.860
rather than just having k1
squared k2 squared, et cetera.

01:07:19.860 --> 01:07:25.890
Just like here, I
would have km kn.

01:07:25.890 --> 01:07:30.360
What happened previously
was that each eigenvalue

01:07:30.360 --> 01:07:32.460
would get inverted.

01:07:32.460 --> 01:07:36.860
If you think about rotating a
matrix, all of its eigenvalues

01:07:36.860 --> 01:07:41.310
are inverted, you are really
rotating the inverse matrix.

01:07:41.310 --> 01:07:44.260
So this here would be the
inverse of whatever matrix

01:07:44.260 --> 01:07:44.990
I have here.

01:07:44.990 --> 01:07:46.426
So this would be C mn.

01:07:49.620 --> 01:07:54.960
So I did will leave you to
do the corresponding linear

01:07:54.960 --> 01:07:59.820
algebra here, but the
answer is correct.

01:07:59.820 --> 01:08:10.630
So the answer is that the
generator of cumulants

01:08:10.630 --> 01:08:15.090
for a joint Gaussian
distribution

01:08:15.090 --> 01:08:27.479
has a form which has a bunch of
the linear terms-- kn lambda n.

01:08:27.479 --> 01:08:29.514
And a bunch of
second order terms,

01:08:29.514 --> 01:08:35.910
so we will have minus
1/2 sum over m and n km

01:08:35.910 --> 01:08:38.245
kn times some coefficient.

01:08:42.550 --> 01:08:46.670
And the series terminates here.

01:08:46.670 --> 01:08:52.710
So for the joint Gaussian,
you have first cumulant.

01:08:52.710 --> 01:08:57.470
So the expectation
value of nm cumulant

01:08:57.470 --> 01:09:01.430
is the same thing as lambda m.

01:09:01.430 --> 01:09:09.149
You have covariances or second
cumulants xm, xn, C is Cmn.

01:09:09.149 --> 01:09:13.109
And in particular,
the diagonal elements

01:09:13.109 --> 01:09:16.430
would correspond
to the variances.

01:09:16.430 --> 01:09:23.490
And all the higher orders
are 0 because there's

01:09:23.490 --> 01:09:25.250
no further term
in the expansion.

01:09:39.750 --> 01:09:47.300
So for example, if I were to
calculate this thing that I

01:09:47.300 --> 01:09:55.100
have on the board here for
the case of a Gaussian,

01:09:55.100 --> 01:10:02.150
for the case of the Gaussian, I
would not have this third term.

01:10:02.150 --> 01:10:04.200
So the answer that
I would write down

01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:06.640
for the case of the
third term would

01:10:06.640 --> 01:10:09.860
be something that
didn't have this.

01:10:09.860 --> 01:10:13.785
And in the way that we
have written things,

01:10:13.785 --> 01:10:16.120
the answer would
have been x1 squared

01:10:16.120 --> 01:10:22.020
x2-- would be just a
lambda 1 squared lambda

01:10:22.020 --> 01:10:27.050
2 plus sigma 1 squared,
or let's call it

01:10:27.050 --> 01:10:36.240
C11, times lambda 2
plus 2 lambda 1 C12.

01:10:36.240 --> 01:10:37.410
And that's it.

01:11:01.670 --> 01:11:05.670
So there is something
that follows from this

01:11:05.670 --> 01:11:13.070
that it is used a
lot in field theory.

01:11:13.070 --> 01:11:15.792
And it's called Wick's theorem.

01:11:15.792 --> 01:11:20.140
So that's just a
particular case of this,

01:11:20.140 --> 01:11:22.480
but let's state it anyway.

01:11:32.410 --> 01:11:51.000
So for Gaussian distributed
variables of 0 mean,

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.770
following condition applies.

01:11:53.770 --> 01:11:56.665
I can take the first
variable raised

01:11:56.665 --> 01:12:00.450
to power n1, the
second variable to n2,

01:12:00.450 --> 01:12:03.592
the last variable
to some other nN

01:12:03.592 --> 01:12:08.530
and look at a joint
expectation value such as this.

01:12:08.530 --> 01:12:16.220
And this is 0 if sum
over alpha and alpha

01:12:16.220 --> 01:12:37.120
is odd and is called sum
over all pairwise contraction

01:12:37.120 --> 01:12:42.056
if a sum over alpha
and alpha is even.

01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:52.320
So actually, I have right
here an example of this.

01:12:52.320 --> 01:12:56.110
If I have a Gaussian
variable-- jointly

01:12:56.110 --> 01:13:00.100
distributed Gaussian variables
where the means are all 0-- so

01:13:00.100 --> 01:13:05.110
if I say that lambda
1 and lambda 2 are 0,

01:13:05.110 --> 01:13:08.210
then this is an odd
power, x1 squared x2.

01:13:08.210 --> 01:13:10.300
Because of the symmetry
it has to be 0,

01:13:10.300 --> 01:13:13.790
but you explicitly see
that every term that I have

01:13:13.790 --> 01:13:16.840
will be multiplying some
power of [INAUDIBLE].

01:13:16.840 --> 01:13:19.000
Whereas if for
other than this, I

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:27.150
was looking at something
like x1 squared x2 x3

01:13:27.150 --> 01:13:32.240
where the net power
is even, then I

01:13:32.240 --> 01:13:35.070
could sort of
imagine putting them

01:13:35.070 --> 01:13:37.330
into these kinds of diagrams.

01:13:37.330 --> 01:13:43.950
Or alternatively, I can
imagine pairing these things

01:13:43.950 --> 01:13:45.780
in all possible ways.

01:13:45.780 --> 01:13:48.246
So one pairing would
be this with this,

01:13:48.246 --> 01:13:57.730
this with this, which would have
given me x1 squared C x2 x3 C.

01:13:57.730 --> 01:14:02.180
Another pairing would
have been x1 with x2.

01:14:02.180 --> 01:14:05.650
And then, naturally, x1 with x3.

01:14:05.650 --> 01:14:11.495
So I would have gotten
x1 with x2 covariance x1

01:14:11.495 --> 01:14:12.820
with extreme x3 covariance.

01:14:15.660 --> 01:14:21.690
But I could have connected
the x1 to x2 or the second x1

01:14:21.690 --> 01:14:22.980
to x2.

01:14:22.980 --> 01:14:26.920
So this comes in 2 variance.

01:14:26.920 --> 01:14:38.320
And so the answer here would
be C11 C23 plus 2 C1 2 C13.

01:14:38.320 --> 01:14:40.190
Yes?

01:14:40.190 --> 01:14:45.930
AUDIENCE: In your writing
of x1 to the n1 [INAUDIBLE].

01:14:45.930 --> 01:14:47.850
It should be the
cumulant, right?

01:14:47.850 --> 01:14:48.696
Or is it the moment?

01:14:48.696 --> 01:14:49.946
PROFESSOR: This is the moment.

01:14:49.946 --> 01:14:50.735
AUDIENCE: OK.

01:14:50.735 --> 01:14:54.420
PROFESSOR: The contractions
are the covariances.

01:14:54.420 --> 01:14:56.042
AUDIENCE: OK.

01:14:56.042 --> 01:15:00.580
PROFESSOR: So the point is
that the Gaussian distribution

01:15:00.580 --> 01:15:05.180
is completely characterized
in terms of its covariances.

01:15:05.180 --> 01:15:07.665
Once you know the
covariances, essentially you

01:15:07.665 --> 01:15:09.700
know everything.

01:15:09.700 --> 01:15:13.080
And in particular, you may be
interested in some particular

01:15:13.080 --> 01:15:14.980
combination of x's.

01:15:14.980 --> 01:15:18.490
And then you use to
express that in terms

01:15:18.490 --> 01:15:22.160
of all possible
pairwise contractions,

01:15:22.160 --> 01:15:24.480
which are the covariances.

01:15:24.480 --> 01:15:29.730
And essentially, in
all of field theory,

01:15:29.730 --> 01:15:32.900
you expand around some kind
of a Gaussian background

01:15:32.900 --> 01:15:35.870
or Gaussian 0 toward the result.

01:15:35.870 --> 01:15:37.520
And then in your
perturbation theory

01:15:37.520 --> 01:15:40.200
you need various
powers of your field

01:15:40.200 --> 01:15:43.079
or some combination of
powers, and you express them

01:15:43.079 --> 01:15:44.620
through these kinds
of relationships.

01:15:55.400 --> 01:15:56.000
Any questions?

01:16:01.440 --> 01:16:01.940
OK.

01:16:08.329 --> 01:16:08.870
This is fine.

01:16:08.870 --> 01:16:10.850
Let's get rid of this.

01:16:22.480 --> 01:16:22.980
OK.

01:16:25.710 --> 01:16:33.500
Now there is one result that
all of statistical mechanics

01:16:33.500 --> 01:16:35.290
hangs on.

01:16:35.290 --> 01:16:39.230
So I expect that
as I get old and I

01:16:39.230 --> 01:16:43.810
get infirm or whatever
and my memory vanishes,

01:16:43.810 --> 01:16:46.272
the last thing that I
will remember before I die

01:16:46.272 --> 01:16:47.730
would be the central
limit theorem.

01:16:58.750 --> 01:17:01.740
And why is this important
is because you end up

01:17:01.740 --> 01:17:05.960
in statistical physics
adding lots of things.

01:17:05.960 --> 01:17:09.960
So really, the question that
you have or you should be asking

01:17:09.960 --> 01:17:13.280
is thermodynamics is
a very precise thing.

01:17:13.280 --> 01:17:15.370
It says that heat
goes from the higher

01:17:15.370 --> 01:17:16.810
temperature to
lower temperature.

01:17:16.810 --> 01:17:21.610
It doesn't say it does that 50%
of the time or 95% of the time.

01:17:21.610 --> 01:17:23.630
It's a definite statement.

01:17:23.630 --> 01:17:25.660
If I am telling you
that ultimately I'm

01:17:25.660 --> 01:17:29.660
going to express everything
in terms of probabilities,

01:17:29.660 --> 01:17:31.610
how does that jive?

01:17:31.610 --> 01:17:34.480
The reason that it jives
is because of this theorem.

01:17:34.480 --> 01:17:40.290
It's because in order to go from
the probabilistic description,

01:17:40.290 --> 01:17:43.170
you will be dealing with
so many different-- so many

01:17:43.170 --> 01:17:46.630
large number of variables--
that probabilistic statements

01:17:46.630 --> 01:17:49.590
actually become precise
deterministic statements.

01:17:49.590 --> 01:17:52.200
And that's captured
by this theorem, which

01:17:52.200 --> 01:18:01.160
says that let's look at the
sum of N random variables.

01:18:06.550 --> 01:18:14.332
And I will indicate the sum
by x and my random variables

01:18:14.332 --> 01:18:17.750
as small x's.

01:18:17.750 --> 01:18:23.230
And let's say that this is, for
the individual set of things

01:18:23.230 --> 01:18:25.580
that I'm adding up
together, some kind

01:18:25.580 --> 01:18:28.690
of a joint probability
distribution

01:18:28.690 --> 01:18:31.670
out of which I take
these random variables.

01:18:31.670 --> 01:18:40.230
So each instance of this sum is
selected from this joint PDF,

01:18:40.230 --> 01:18:45.510
so x itself is a random variable
because of possible choices

01:18:45.510 --> 01:18:49.180
of different xi from this
probability distribution.

01:18:51.720 --> 01:18:56.420
So what I'm interested is what
is the probability for the sum?

01:18:56.420 --> 01:19:03.770
So what is the p that
determines this sum?

01:19:09.410 --> 01:19:13.950
I will go by the root of these
characteristic functions.

01:19:13.950 --> 01:19:19.210
I will say, OK, what's the
expectation value of-- well,

01:19:19.210 --> 01:19:24.170
let's-- what's the Fourier
transform of this probability

01:19:24.170 --> 01:19:26.730
distribution?

01:19:26.730 --> 01:19:31.450
If we transform, by definition
it is the expectation of e

01:19:31.450 --> 01:19:37.320
to the minus ik this big X,
which is the sum over all off

01:19:37.320 --> 01:19:38.351
the small x's.

01:19:47.640 --> 01:19:49.370
Do I have that
definition somewhere?

01:19:49.370 --> 01:19:50.820
I erased it.

01:19:50.820 --> 01:19:56.290
Basically, what is this?

01:19:56.290 --> 01:20:02.740
If this k was, in fact,
different k's-- if I had a k1

01:20:02.740 --> 01:20:05.940
multiplying x1,
k2 multiplying x2,

01:20:05.940 --> 01:20:08.790
that would be the definition
of the joint characteristics

01:20:08.790 --> 01:20:13.350
function for this joint
probability distribution.

01:20:13.350 --> 01:20:18.470
So what this is is you take the
joint characteristic function,

01:20:18.470 --> 01:20:27.010
which depends on k1
k2, all the way to kn.

01:20:27.010 --> 01:20:28.830
And you set all of
them to be the same.

01:20:38.460 --> 01:20:41.530
So take the joint
characteristic function

01:20:41.530 --> 01:20:44.090
depends on N Fourier variables.

01:20:44.090 --> 01:20:47.000
Put all of them the same k
and you have that for the sum.

01:20:50.230 --> 01:20:55.970
So I can certainly do
that by adding a log here.

01:21:00.600 --> 01:21:02.720
Nothing has changed.

01:21:02.720 --> 01:21:09.340
I know that the log is the
generator of the cumulants.

01:21:09.340 --> 01:21:13.470
So this is a sum
over, let's say, n

01:21:13.470 --> 01:21:16.690
running from 1 to
infinity minus ik

01:21:16.690 --> 01:21:20.390
to the power of n
over n factorial,

01:21:20.390 --> 01:21:22.990
the joint cumulant of the sum.

01:21:29.640 --> 01:21:31.790
So what is the
expansion that I would

01:21:31.790 --> 01:21:37.580
have for log of the joint
characteristic function?

01:21:37.580 --> 01:21:43.150
Well, typically I would say have
at the lowest order k1 times

01:21:43.150 --> 01:21:45.930
the mean of the first
variable, k2 times

01:21:45.930 --> 01:21:47.690
the mean of the second variable.

01:21:47.690 --> 01:21:49.440
But all of them are the same.

01:21:49.440 --> 01:21:52.550
So the first order,
I would get minus i

01:21:52.550 --> 01:21:58.480
the same k sum over n
of the first cumulant

01:21:58.480 --> 01:22:00.360
of the N-th variable.

01:22:06.180 --> 01:22:09.160
Typically, this
second order term,

01:22:09.160 --> 01:22:11.080
I would have all
kinds of products.

01:22:11.080 --> 01:22:15.920
I would have k1 k3 k2 k4,
as well as k1 squared.

01:22:15.920 --> 01:22:18.190
But now all of them
become the same,

01:22:18.190 --> 01:22:23.780
and so what I will have
is a minus ik squared.

01:22:23.780 --> 01:22:34.260
But then I have all possible
pairings mn of xm xn cumulants.

01:22:36.802 --> 01:22:37.770
AUDIENCE: Question.

01:22:37.770 --> 01:22:38.410
PROFESSOR: Yes?

01:22:38.410 --> 01:22:40.170
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
expression you probably

01:22:40.170 --> 01:22:41.000
should use different
indices when you're

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.365
summing over elements
of Taylor serious

01:22:43.365 --> 01:22:45.828
and when you're summing
over your [INAUDIBLE]

01:22:45.828 --> 01:22:46.806
random variables.

01:22:46.806 --> 01:22:53.163
Just-- it gets confusing
when both indexes are n.

01:22:53.163 --> 01:22:56.330
PROFESSOR: This here, you
want me to right here, say, i?

01:22:56.330 --> 01:22:58.752
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:22:58.752 --> 01:23:00.890
PROFESSOR: OK.

01:23:00.890 --> 01:23:02.978
And here I can write i and j.

01:23:12.020 --> 01:23:15.180
So I think there's
still a 2 factorial.

01:23:15.180 --> 01:23:18.680
And then there's higher orders.

01:23:18.680 --> 01:23:23.490
Essentially then, matching
the coefficients of minus ik

01:23:23.490 --> 01:23:27.470
from the left minus
ik from the right

01:23:27.470 --> 01:23:35.440
will enable me to calculate
relationships between cumulants

01:23:35.440 --> 01:23:39.980
of the sum and cumulants of
the individual variables.

01:23:39.980 --> 01:23:44.070
This first one of them is
not particularly surprising.

01:23:44.070 --> 01:23:46.980
You would say that
the mean of the sum

01:23:46.980 --> 01:23:49.540
is sum of the means of
the individual variables.

01:23:54.890 --> 01:24:02.290
The second statement is
that the variance of the sum

01:24:02.290 --> 01:24:11.410
really involves a pair, i
and j, running from 1 to N.

01:24:11.410 --> 01:24:15.030
So if these variable
were independent,

01:24:15.030 --> 01:24:18.230
you would be just
adding the variances.

01:24:18.230 --> 01:24:21.640
Since they are
potentially dependent,

01:24:21.640 --> 01:24:25.610
you have to also keep
track of covariances.

01:24:28.320 --> 01:24:33.430
And this kind of summation
extends to higher and higher

01:24:33.430 --> 01:24:38.130
cumulants, essentially
including more and more powers

01:24:38.130 --> 01:24:40.905
of cumulants that you
would put on that side.

01:24:47.170 --> 01:24:49.570
And what we do
with that, I guess

01:24:49.570 --> 01:24:52.030
we'll start next time around.

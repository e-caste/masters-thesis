00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:04.050
Least mean squares
estimation is remarkable

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:06.820
because it has such
a simple answer.

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:09.100
The way to come
up with estimates,

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:12.070
if what you care about is
to keep the mean squared

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:14.630
error small, the way to
come up with estimates

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:18.120
is to just report the
conditional expectation, which

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.440
is going to be a number,
once you have obtained

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.060
some values of the data.

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.080
Or more abstractly,
you can think of it

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.240
as a random variable, if you
do not know ahead of time

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.510
what data you're
going to obtain.

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:31.820
Because this estimator
is so important,

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.480
it is worth writing down
what the performance

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.810
of that estimator is.

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:39.620
So suppose that
you have obtained

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.350
a particular measurement,
a particular value

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.520
of the observation, then
the resulting mean squared

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.100
error within that
conditional universe

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.000
where you have already
obtained that value,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.690
is just this quantity.

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:57.350
It's the mean square of the
error between the variable

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.160
that you're trying to
estimate and your estimate.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.170
And everything gets
computed within

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:03.950
this conditional universe.

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:07.010
Now this is a very
familiar quantity, however.

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.039
It's the expected value of
a random variable difference

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:13.070
from its mean, squared.

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.240
This is just the
variance, except that

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.155
because all quantities
are calculated

00:01:17.155 --> 00:01:21.850
in a conditional universe, this
is the conditional variance.

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.140
So the conditional variance is
the optimal mean squared error,

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:27.960
the mean squared
error that you obtain

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.620
when you use this
particular estimate.

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:33.759
And it's the value that you
would report to your boss

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:37.270
if you were asked how good
is the estimate that you're

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:38.870
giving me.

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:43.140
But suppose that you have not
yet obtained a measurement,

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.320
but you're going to
your boss and you're

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:50.180
proposing this particular
estimator as your design.

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.500
What are you going to
report to your boss

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.180
as the performance
of your design?

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.030
Since you have not yet
obtained the value of X,

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.030
X is a random
variable, you do not

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.320
know what the value of this
conditional expectation

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.090
is going to be.

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:06.630
It's a random variable.

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.759
But no matter what
it is, this is

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.380
going to be the error that
you're going to be obtaining.

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.110
And this is the overall value
of the mean squared error.

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.800
So this is the
quantity that you would

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.350
report to your boss as
your overall mean squared

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:25.180
error, the value that you
report before obtaining

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.480
any specific measurement.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.030
Now, what is this quantity?

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:34.020
This quantity is just the
average of this quantity

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:40.310
up here, averaged over all
the possible values of X.

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.329
And in our more
abstract notation,

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:47.600
it is just the expectation
of the conditional variance.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.730
The conditional variance, the
abstract conditional variance,

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.829
is a random variable that
takes this value whenever

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:57.400
capital X happens to
be equal to little x.

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.550
And when we average it over
all possible values of X,

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:04.600
we just have the expectation
of this random variable.

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.710
Let me continue now
with a few more comments

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:11.860
on LMS estimation.

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.800
First, something that should
be pretty clear at this point

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.010
is that LMS estimation is
only relevant to estimation

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:19.030
problems.

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.470
This is because in
hypothesis testing problems

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:24.690
we typically care about
the probability of error,

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.380
not the mean squared error.

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:32.890
A second important comment
is that in some cases

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:37.380
the LMS estimates and the
MAP estimates turn out

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:38.960
to be the same.

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:40.430
When is that the case?

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:43.210
If the posterior
distribution of Theta

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:48.160
happens to have a single
peak, and it is also

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.660
symmetric around
a certain point,

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.720
so that the peak also occurs
at that particular point,

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.780
then clearly the
peak occurs here.

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.050
But the conditional expectation
is also that same point,

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:04.560
because it is the
center of symmetry.

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:09.400
So in those cases, the two types
of estimates, or estimators,

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:10.960
coincide.

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:12.380
When does this happen?

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:17.640
This happens in one particular
important special case.

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.870
We have seen that in
linear-normal models

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:23.600
the posterior
distribution is normal.

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:27.880
And so this is one case where
the MAP estimate and the LMS

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.871
estimate are going to coincide.

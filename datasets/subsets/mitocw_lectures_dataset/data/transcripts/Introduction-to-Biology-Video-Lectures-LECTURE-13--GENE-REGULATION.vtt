WEBVTT

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Good morning.
Good morning.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:49.000
So, what I would like to do today
is pick up on our basic theme of

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:56.000
molecular biology. We've
talked about DNA replication.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:03.000
The transcription of DNA into
RNA, and the translation of RNA

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000
into protein. We discussed last
time some of the variations between

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.000
different types of organisms:
viruses, prokaryotes,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.000
eukaryotes, with respect to the
details of how they do that in

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.000
general that bacteria have
circular DNA chromosomes typically

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
that eukaryotes have
linear chromosomes,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
etc. What I'd like to talk
about today is variation,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
but variation not between organisms
but within an organism from time to

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
time and place to place, namely,
how it is that some genes or

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
gene activities are turned on, on
some occasions, and turned off on

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
other occasions.
This is, obviously,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
a very important problem
to an organism, particularly

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
to somebody like you who's
a multi-cellular organism,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
and has the same DNA instruction
set in all of your cells.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
It's obviously quite important to
make sure that the same basic code

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
is doing different
things in different cells.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
It's important, also, to a
bacterium to make sure that

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
it's doing different
things at different times,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
depending on its environment.
So, I'm going to talk about a very

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
particular system today as an
illustration of how genes are

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
regulated, but before
we do that, let's

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Ask, where are the different
places in this picture?

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
DNA goes to DNA goes to RNA goes
to protein, in which you might,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000
in principle, regulate the activity
of a gene. Could you regulate the

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000
activity of a gene by actually
changing the DNA encoded in the

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
genome? So, why not?
Because what? It becomes a

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000
different gene. Yeah,
that's just a definition.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Why couldn't the cell just decide
that I want this gene now to change

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000
in some way? Oh, I don't
know, I'll alter the DNA

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.000
sequence in some way. And,
that'll make the gene work.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Could that happen? Is that allowed?
Yeah, it turns out to happen.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:27.000
It's not the most common thing,
and it's not the thing they'll talk

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.000
about in the textbooks a lot but
you can actually do regulation.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.000
So, the levels of regulation are
many, and one is actually at the

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000
level of DNA rearrangement.
As we'll come to later in the

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000
course, for example, your
immune system creates new,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000
functional genes by rearranging
locally some pieces of DNA,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.000
some bacteria, particularly
infectious organisms control whether

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000
genes are turned on or off
by actually going in there,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
and flipping around a piece
of DNA in their chromosome.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
And, that's how they turn the gene
on or off is they actually go in and

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
change the genome. There's
some protein that actually

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
flips the orientation of a segment
of DNA. Now, these are a little

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
funky, and we're not going
to talk a lot about them,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
but you should know, almost
anything that can happen does

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
happen and gets exploited in
different ways by organisms.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
So, DNA rearrangement
certainly happens. It's rare,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000
but it's always
cool when it happens.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.000
So, it's fun to look at.
And, something like the immune

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:40.000
system can't be dismissed as simply
an oddity. That's an incredibly

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.000
important thing. The
most common form is at the

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:51.000
level of transcriptional regulation,
where whether or not a transcript

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:57.000
gets made is how it's processed
can be different. First off,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.000
the initiation of transcription
that RNA polymerase should happen to

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000
sit down at this gene on this
occasion and start transcribing it

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000
is a potentially regulatable (sic)
step that maybe you're only going to

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000
turn on the gene for beta-globin and
alpha-globin that together make the

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000
two components of hemoglobin,
and you're only going to turn them

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000
on in red blood cells, or
red blood cell precursors,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000
and that could be done at the
level of whether or not you make the

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000
message in the first place.
That's one place it can be done.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.000
Another place is the splicing
choices that you make.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.000
With respect to your message, you
get this thing with a number of

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000
different potential exons, and
you can regulate how this gene

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000
is used by deciding to splice it
this way, and skip over that exon

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000
perhaps, or not skip over that
exon. That alternative spicing is a

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000
powerful way to regulate.
And then finally, you can also

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:06.000
regulate at the level
of mRNA stability.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
Stability means the persistence of
the message, the degradation of the

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
message. It could be
that in certain cells,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
the message is protected so
that it hangs around longer.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
And, in other cells, perhaps,
it's unprotected and it's

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
degraded very rapidly. If
it's degraded very rapidly,

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
it doesn't get a chance to make a
protein or maybe it doesn't get to

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
make too many copies of the protein.
If it's persistent for a long time,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
it can make a lot
of copies of protein.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:35.000
All of those things can and
do occur. Then, of course,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.000
there is the regulation at
the level of translation.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:46.000
Translation, if I give you an mRNA,
is it automatically going to be

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:51.000
translated? Maybe the cell has a
way to sequester the RNA to ramp it

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:57.000
up in some way so that it
doesn't get to the ribosome under

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000
some conditions, and under
other conditions it does

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000
get to the ribosome, or
some ways to block in other

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
manners than just sequestering it,
but to physically block whether or

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000
not this message gets translated,
what turns out that there's a

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
tremendous amount of that.
It's, again, not the most common,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.000
but we're learning, particularly
over the last couple of years,

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
that regulation of the translation
of an mRNA is important.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000
There are, although I won't
talk about them at length,

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000
an exciting new set of
genes called micro RNA's,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000
teeny little RNAs that encode 21-22
base pair segments that are able to

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:39.000
pair with a messenger RNA and
interfere in some ways partially

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.000
with its translatability. And
so, by the number and the kinds

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.000
of little micro RNAs that are there,
organisms can tweak up or down how

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000
actively a particular
message is being translated.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:57.000
So, the ability to regulate
translation in a number of different

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.000
ways is important.
And then, of course,

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:06.000
there's post-translational
control. Once a protein is made,

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000
there's post-translational
regulation that could happen.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.000
It could be that the protein
is modified in some way.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.000
The proteins say completely
inactive unless you put a phosphate

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.000
group on it, and some enzyme comes
along and puts a phosphate group on

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000
it. Or, it's inactive until you
take off the phosphate group.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000
All sorts of post-translational
modifications can occur to proteins

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
after the amino acid chain is made
that can affect whether or not the

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000
protein is active. Every
one of these is potentially a

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.000
step by which an organism can
regulate whether or not you have a

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.000
certain biochemical activity present
in a certain amount at a certain

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000
time. And, every one of these
gets used. This is the thing about

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000
coming to a system that has been in
the process of evolution for three

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000
and a half billion years is that
even little differences can be

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000
fought over as competitive
advantages, and can be fixed

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.000
by an organism. So, if a
tiny little thing began to

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:10.000
help the organism slightly,
it could reach fixation. And,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.000
you're coming along to this system,
which has had about three and a half

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:20.000
billion years of patches
to the software code,

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:25.000
and it's just got all sorts of
layers and regulation piled on top

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:30.000
of it. All of these things happen.
But, what we think is the most

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.000
important out of this whole
collection is this guy.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:40.000
The fundamental place at which
you're going to regulate whether or

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.000
not you have the product of a gene
is whether you bother to transcribe

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:50.000
its RNA. But I do want
to say because, yes? And,

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:55.000
which exons you used
and which aren't? Yeah,

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.000
well, there are tissue-specific
factors that are gene-specific

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
that can influence that. And,
surprisingly little is known

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
about the details. There
are a couple of cases where

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000
people know, but as you'd imagine,
you actually need a regulatory

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
system in that tissue to be able
to decide to skip over that exon.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.000
And, the mechanics of that
surprisingly are understood in very

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
few cases. And, you
might think that evolution

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
wouldn't like to use that as the
most common thing because you really

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.000
do have to make a specialized
thing to do that. So, that's what

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
happens on these. That's
one in particular where I

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
think a tremendous amount
of more work has to happen.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
mRNA stability, we understand some
of it but not all the factors in

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
this business. I was
telling you about translation

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
with these little micro-RNAs is
stuff that's really only a few years

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
old that people have
come to understand. So,

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
there's a lot to be understood about
these things. I'm going to tell you

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
about initiation of mRNAs,
because it's the area where we know

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
the most, and I think it'll give you
a good idea of the general paradigm.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
But, any of you who want to go
into this will find that there's a

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
tremendous amount more to still
be discovered about these things.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:05.000
So, the amount of protein that
a cell might make varies wildly.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:10.000
Your red blood cells, 80%
of your red blood cells,

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:15.000
protein, is alpha or beta-globin.
It's a huge amount. That's not

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:21.000
true in any other cell in your body.
So, we were talking about pretty

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:26.000
significant ranges of difference
as to how much protein is made.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:31.000
How do things like that happen?
Well, I'm going to describe the

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:37.000
simplest and classic case of
gene regulation and bacteria,

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:43.000
and in particular, the
famous lack operon of E coli.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:49.000
So, this was the first case in
which regulation was ever really

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:55.000
worked out, and it stands today
as a very good paradigm of how

00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:00.000
regulation works. E
coli, in order to grow,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:05.000
needs a carbon source. In
particular, E coli is fond of sugar.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:10.000
It would like to have a sugar
to grow on. Given a choice,

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:15.000
what's E coli's favorite sugar?
It's glucose, right, because we

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:20.000
have the whole cycle of glucose.
The whole pathway of glucose goes

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:25.000
to pyruvate, which we've talked
about, and glucose is the preferred

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:30.000
sugar to go into that
pathway, OK, of glycolysis.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:36.000
Glycolysis: the breakdown of glucose.
But, suppose there's no glucose

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:42.000
available. Is E coli willing
to have a different sugar?

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:48.000
Sure, because E coli's not stupid.
If it were to refuse another sugar,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:54.000
it wouldn't be able to grow. So, it
has a variety of pathways that will

00:12:54.000 --> 00:13:00.000
shunt other sugars to glucose,
which will then allow you to go

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:08.000
through glycolysis,
etc. Now, given a choice,

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:16.000
it would prefer to use the glucose.
But if not, suppose you gave it

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:24.000
lactose. Lactose is a disaccharide.
It's milk sugar, and I'll just

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:32.000
briefly sketch, so lactose
is a disaccharide where

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:40.000
you've got a glucose
and a galactose.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:50.000
Glucose plus galactose equals
lactose. So, if E coli is given

00:13:50.000 --> 00:14:00.000
galactose, it is able to break it
down into glucose plus galactose.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:08.000
And it does that by a particular
enzyme called beta galactosidase,

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:17.000
which breaks down glactosides.
And, it'll give you galactose plus

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:25.000
glucose. How much
beta-galactosidase does an E coli

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:32.000
cell have around? Sorry?
None? But how does it do this?

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:38.000
When it needs it, it'll
synthesize it. When it needs it,

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:43.000
like, there's no glucose and
there's a lot of galactose around,

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:49.000
how much of it will there be?
A lot. It turns out that in

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:54.000
circumstances where E coli is
dependent on galactose as its fuel,

00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:00.000
something like 10%
of total protein

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:06.000
can be beta-gal under the
circumstances when you have

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:13.000
galactose but no glucose.
Sorry? Sorry, when you have

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:19.000
lactose but no glucose.
Thank you. So, when you have

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:26.000
lactose but no glucose, E coli
has 10% of its protein weight

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:33.000
as beta-galactosidase. Wow.
But when you have glucose

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:39.000
around or you don't have lactose
around, you have very little.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:45.000
It could be almost none,
trace amounts. So, why do this?

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:51.000
Why not, for example, just have a
far more reasonable some compromise?

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:57.000
Like, let's always just have
1% of beta-galactosidase.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:04.000
Why do we need the 0-10%?
10%'s actually extremely high.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:09.000
So what. It's a good insurance
policy. So, if I only have

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:15.000
galactose, I need more. Well,
I mean, 1% will still digest

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:21.000
it. I'll still do it.
What's the problem? Sorry?

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:27.000
So what, I do it at a slower rate.
Life's long. Why not? Ah, it has

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.000
to compete. So, if the
cell to the left had a

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:35.000
mutation that got it to
produce four times as much,

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000
then it would soak up the
lactose in the environment,

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:42.000
grow faster, etc. etc.,
and we could have competed.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000
So, these little tuning mutations
have a huge effect amongst this

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.000
competing population of bacteria.
And so, if E coli currently thinks

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:53.000
that it's really good to have almost
non at sometimes and 10% at other

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000
times, you can bet that it's worked
that out through the product of

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.000
pretty rigorous competition,
that it doesn't want to waste the

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000
energy making this when you don't
need it, and that when you do need

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:07.000
it, you really have to compete hard
by growing as fast as you can when

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.000
you have that lactose around.
OK. So, how does it actually get

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:16.000
the lactose, sorry, keep
me honest on lactose versus

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:22.000
galactose, into the cell?
It turns out that it also has

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:27.000
another gene product, another
protein, which is a lactose

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:32.000
permease. And, any
guesses as to what a

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:38.000
lactose permease does? It
makes the cell permeable to

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:43.000
lactose, right, good. So,
the lactose can get into

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:49.000
the cell, and then beta-gal can
break it down into galactose plus

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:54.000
glucose. These two things,
in fact, both get regulated,

00:17:54.000 --> 00:18:00.000
beta-gal and this lactose
permease. So, how does it work?

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:07.000
Let's take a look now at the
structure of the lack operon.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:14.000
So, I mentioned briefly last time,
what's an operon? Remember we said

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:21.000
that in bacteria, you often
made a transcript that had

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:29.000
multiple proteins that
were encoded on it.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.000
A single mRNA could get made, and
multiple starts for translation

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:37.000
could occur, and you could
make multiple proteins.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:41.000
And, this would be a good thing
if you wanted to make a bunch of

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:45.000
proteins that were a part of
the same biochemical pathway.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:49.000
Such an object, a regulated piece
of DNA that makes a transcript

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:53.000
encoding multiple polypeptides is
called an operon because they're

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:57.000
operated together. So,
let's take a look here at the

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:03.000
lack operon. I said
there was a promoter.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:09.000
Here is a promoter for the operon,
and we'll call it P lack, promoter

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:16.000
for the lack operon. Here
is the first gene that is

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:23.000
encoded. So, the message will
start here, actually about here,

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:30.000
and start going off. And, the
first gene is given the name lack Z.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.000
It happens to encode
beta-galactosidase enzyme.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:38.000
Remember, they did a mutant hunt,
and when they did the mutant hunt,

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:42.000
they didn't know what each gene
was as they isolated mutants.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.000
So, they just gave them
names of letters. And so,

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:50.000
it's called lack Z. And,
everybody in molecular biology

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:54.000
knows this is the lack Z gene,
although Z has nothing to do with

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:58.000
beta-galactosidase. It was
just the letter given to it.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:02.000
But, it's stuck.
Next is lack Y.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:07.000
And, that encodes the permease.
And, there is also lack A, which

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:12.000
encodes a transacetylase, and
as far as I'm concerned you can

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:17.000
forget about it. OK, but
I just mentioned that it is

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:22.000
there, and it actually does
make three polypeptides.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:27.000
We won't worry about it,
OK, but it does make a

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:32.000
transacetylase, OK? But it
won't figure in what we're

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:36.000
going to talk about, and
actually remarkably little is

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:41.000
known about the transacetylase.
There's also one other gene I need

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:46.000
to talk about, and
that's over here,

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:50.000
and that's called lack I.
And, it too has a promoter,

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:55.000
which we can call PI, for
the promoter for lack I.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:00.000
And, this encodes a
very interesting protein.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:05.000
So, we get here one message
encoding one polypeptide here.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:11.000
This mRNA encodes one polypeptide.
It is monocystronic. This guy here

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:17.000
is a polycystronic message. It
has multiple cystrons, which is

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:23.000
the dusty old name for these regions
that were translated into distinct

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:29.000
proteins. And so,
that's that mRNA.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:40.000
So, lack I, this encodes
a very interesting protein,

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:52.000
which is called the lack repressor.
The lack repressor, actually I'll

00:21:52.000 --> 00:22:04.000
bring this down a
moment, is not an enzyme.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:10.000
It's not a self-surface channel
for putting in galactose.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:17.000
It is a DNA binding protein.
It binds to DNA. But, it's not a

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:23.000
nonspecific DNA binding protein
that binds to any old DNA.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:30.000
It has a sequence-specific preference.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:35.000
It's a protein that has a particular
confirmation, a particular shape,

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:40.000
a particular set of amino acids
sticking out, that it combined into

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:46.000
the major groove of DNA in a
sequence-specific fashion such that

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:51.000
it particularly likes to recognize
a certain sequence of nucleotides and

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:57.000
binds there. Where is the specific
sequence of nucleotides where this

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:03.000
guy likes to bind? It so
happens that it's there.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:11.000
And this is called the operator
sequence or the operator site.

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:18.000
So, this protein likes
to go and bind there. Now,

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:26.000
I've drawn this, by the way,
so that this operator site is

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:34.000
actually right overlapping
the promoter site.

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:40.000
Who likes to bind at the
promoter site? RNA polymerase.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:46.000
What's going to happen if the lack
repressor protein is sitting there?

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:52.000
RNA polymerase can't
bind. It's just physically,

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:58.000
blocked from binding. So,
let's examine some cases here.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:06.000
Let's suppose that
we look at here

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:14.000
at our gene. We've got our promoter,
P lack. We've got the operator site

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:22.000
here. We've got the lack Z gene
here, and we've got the lack

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:31.000
repressor, lack I, the
repressor sitting there.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:38.000
Polymerase tries to come along
to this, and it's blocked.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:45.000
So, what will happen in terms
of the transcription of the lack

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:52.000
operon: no mRNA.
So, that's great.

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:59.000
So, we've solved one
problem right off the bat.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:03.000
We want to be sure that sometimes
there's going to be no mRNA made.

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:07.000
This way, we're not going to
waste any metabolic energy,

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:11.000
making beta-galactosidase.
Are we done? No? Why not.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:16.000
We've got to sometimes
make beta-galactosidase.

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.000
So, we've got to get that
repressor off there. Well,

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:24.000
how is the repressor going to
come off there? When do we want the

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:29.000
repressor off there: when
there's lactose present.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:34.000
So, somehow we need to build
some kind of an elaborate sensory

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:39.000
mechanism that is able to
tell when lactose is present,

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:44.000
and send a signal to the
repressor protein saying,

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:49.000
hey, lactose is around. The
signal gets transmitted all the

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:55.000
way to the repressor protein, and
the repressor protein comes off.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:00.000
What kind of an elaborate
sensory mechanism might be built?

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:05.000
Use lactose as what? So, this
is actually pretty simple.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:11.000
You're saying just take lactose,
and you want lactose to be its own

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:16.000
signal? So, if lactose were
to just bind to the repressor,

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:21.000
the repressor might then know
that there was lactose around.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:27.000
Well, what would it do if
lactose bound to it? Sorry? Why

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:33.000
would it fall off? Yep. More
interested in the lactose.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:39.000
So, if you're suggestion,
this is good. I like the design

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:45.000
work going on here. The
suggestion is that if lactose

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:51.000
binds to this here,
binds to our repressor,

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:57.000
it's going to fall off because
it's more interested in lactose

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:03.000
than in the DNA. Now, how
is the interest actually

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:07.000
conveyed into something material?
Because the actual level of

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:11.000
cognitive like or dislike for DNA
on the part of this polypeptide is

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:15.000
unclear, you may be
anthropomorphizing slightly with

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:19.000
regard to this polypeptide chain.
So, mechanistically, what's going

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:23.000
to happen? Shape. Yes,
shape? Change confirmation,

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:27.000
the binding act, the act of
binding lactose creates some energy,

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:31.000
may change the
shape of the protein,

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:35.000
and that shape of the protein may,
in the process of wiggling around to

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:40.000
bind lactose may de-wiggle some
other part of it that now no longer

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:44.000
binds so well to DNA. That
is exactly what happens.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:49.000
Good job. So, you guys
have designed, in fact,

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:54.000
what really happens. What
happens is what's called an

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:58.000
allosteric change. It
just means other shape.

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:03.000
So, it just changes its shape,
that it changes shape on binding of

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:10.000
lactose. And it falls
off because it's less

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:18.000
suitable for binding this particular
DNA sequence when it's bound to

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:26.000
lactose there.
So, in this case,

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:34.000
in the presence of lactose,
lack I does not bind.

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:44.000
And, the lack operon is transcribed.
Yes? Uh-oh. OK, all right

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:54.000
designers, here we've got a
problem. You have such a cool system,

00:28:54.000 --> 00:29:03.000
right? You were going
to sense lactose.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:10.000
Lactose was going to bind
to the lack repressor,

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:17.000
change its confirmation falloff:
uh-oh. But, as you point out,

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:25.000
how's it going to get any lactose,
because there's not a lactose

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:32.000
permease because the
lactose permease is made by

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:37.000
the same operon.
So, what if, in fact,

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:40.000
instead of getting one of these DOD
mill speck kind of things of some

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:43.000
repressor that is absolutely so
tight that it never falls off under

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:47.000
any circumstances, what if
we build a slightly sloppy

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:50.000
repressor that occasionally
falls off, and occasionally allows

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:53.000
transcription of the lack operon?
Then, we'll have some trace

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:56.000
quantities of permease around.
With a little bit of permease

00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:00.000
around, a little
lactose will get in.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:04.000
And, as long as even a
little lactose gets in,

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:08.000
it'll now shift the equilibrium
so that the repressor is off more,

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:12.000
and of course that will make
more permease, and shift,

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:16.000
and shift, and shift, and
shift. So, as long as it's not

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:21.000
so perfectly engineered as to
have nothing being transcribed,

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:25.000
so no mRNA is really very little
mRNA. See, this is what's so good,

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:29.000
I think, about having MIT students
learn this stuff because there are

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:33.000
all sorts of wonderful design
principles here about how

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:38.000
you build systems. And, I
think this is just a very

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:43.000
good example of how you
build a system like this.

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:48.000
Now, all right, so we now have the
ability to have lack on and lack off,

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:52.000
and that is lack off, mostly
off because of your permease

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:57.000
problem: very good. Now,
let's take a little digression

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:02.000
about, how do we know this?
This kind of reasoning,

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:06.000
I've now told you the answer.
But let's actually take a look at

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:10.000
understanding the evidence
that lets you conclude this.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:14.000
So, in order to do this, and
this is the famous work in

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:18.000
molecular biology of Jacobin Manoux
in the late '50s for which they won

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:22.000
a Nobel Prize, they wanted
to collect some mutants.

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:26.000
Remember, this is before the time
of DNA sequence or anything like

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:30.000
that, and wanted to collect
mutants that affected this process.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:37.000
So, in order to collect mutants
that screwed up the regulation,

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:45.000
they knew that beta-galactosidase
was produced in much higher quantity

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:53.000
if lactose was around. The
difficulty with that was that

00:31:53.000 --> 00:32:01.000
wild type E coli, when
you had no lactose would

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:07.000
produce very little beta-gal,
one unit of beta-gal,

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:11.000
and in the presence of lactose,
would produce a lot, let's call it 1,

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:16.000
00 units of beta-gal. But,
the problem with playing

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:20.000
around with this is lactose
is serving two different roles.

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:25.000
Lactose is both the inducer of the
expression of the gene by virtue of

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:30.000
binding to the
repressor, etc., etc.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:34.000
But, it's also the substrate for the
enzyme because as beta-galactosidase

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:38.000
gets made, it breaks down the
lactose. So, there's less lactose

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:43.000
in binding, and if you wanted to
really study the regulatory controls,

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:47.000
you have the problem that the thing
that's inducing the gene by binding

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:52.000
to the repressor is the thing that's
getting destroyed by the product of

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:56.000
the gene. So, it's going
to make the kinetics of

00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:01.000
studying such a process really messy.
It would be very nice if you could

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:05.000
make a form of lactose that could
induce beta-galactosidase by binding

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:10.000
to the repressor, but
wasn't itself digested.

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:17.000
Chemically, in fact, you
can do that. Chemically,

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:24.000
it's possible to make a
molecule called IPTG, which is a

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:32.000
galactoside analog. And,
what it does is this molecule

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:41.000
here which I'll just sketch very
quickly here, it's a sulfur there,

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:50.000
and you can see vaguely similar,
this is able to be an inducer.

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:59.000
It'll induce beta-gal, but not a
substrate. It won't get digested.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:04.000
So, it'll stick around as long as
you want. It's also very convenient

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:09.000
to use a molecule that was
developed called ex-gal.

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:15.000
Ex-gal again has a sugar moiety,
and then it also has this kind of a

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:20.000
funny double ring here, which
is a chlorine, and a bromine,

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:25.000
and etc. And, this guy here is
not an inducer. It's not capable of

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:31.000
being induced, of
inducing beta-galactosidase

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:37.000
expression. But,
it is a substrate.

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:43.000
It will be broken down by the
enzyme, and rather neatly when it's

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:49.000
broken down it turns blue.
These two chemicals turned out to

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:55.000
be very handy in trying to
work out the regulation of the

00:34:55.000 --> 00:35:00.000
lack operon. So, if I,
instead of adding lactose,

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:06.000
if I think about adding IPTG, my
inducer, when I add IPTG I'm going

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:12.000
to get beta-gal produced.
When I don't have IPTG, I won't

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:18.000
produce beta-gal. But then
I don't have a problem of

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:24.000
this getting used up. So now,
what kind of a mutant might

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:29.000
I look for? I might look
for a mutant that even

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:34.000
in the absence of the inducer,
IPTG, still produces a lot of

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:39.000
beta-gal. Now, I can also
look for mutants that no

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:44.000
matter what never produce beta-gal,
right? But, what would they likely

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:50.000
be? They'd likely be structural
mutations affecting the coding

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:55.000
sequence of beta-gal,
right? Those will happen.

00:35:55.000 --> 00:36:00.000
I can collect mutations that
cause the E coli never to

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:05.000
produce beta-gal. But
that's not as interesting as

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:11.000
collecting mutations that block the
repression that cause beta-gal to be

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:16.000
produced all of the time. So,
how would I find such a mutant?

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:22.000
I want to find a mutant that's
producing a lot of beta-gal even

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:27.000
when there's no IPTG. So,
let's place some E coli on a

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:33.000
plate. Should we put IPTG
on a plate? No, so no IPTG.

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:37.000
What do I look for? How do
I tell whether or not any of

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:42.000
these guys here is producing
a lot of beta-gal? Yep?

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:46.000
So, no IPTG, but put on ex-gal,
and if anybody's producing a lot of

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:51.000
beta-gal, what happens? They
turn blue: very easy to go

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:55.000
through lots of E coli like
that looking for something blue.

00:36:55.000 --> 00:37:00.000
And so, lots of mutants were
collected that were blue.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:05.000
And, these chemicals are still used
today. They're routinely used in

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:10.000
labs, ex-gal and stuff like that,
making bugs turn blue because this

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:15.000
has turned out to be such a
well-studied system that we use it

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:20.000
for a lot of things. So,
mutants were found that were

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:25.000
constituative. So, mutants
were found that were

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:30.000
constituative mutants.
Constituative mutants: meaning

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:35.000
expressing all the time,
no longer regulated, so,

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:40.000
characterizing these
constituative mutants.

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:44.000
It turns out that they fell into two
different classes of constituative

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:48.000
mutants. If we had enough time,
and you could read the papers and

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:52.000
all, what I would do is give you
the descriptions that Jacobin Maneaux

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:56.000
had of these funny mutants which
they'd isolated and were trying to

00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:00.000
characterize, and how to
puzzle out what was going on.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:04.000
But, it's complicated and hard,
and makes your head hurt if you

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:08.000
don't know what the answer is.
So, I'm going to first tell you the

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:12.000
answer of what's going on, and
then sort of see how you would

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:17.000
know that this was the case.
But, imagine that you didn't know

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:21.000
this answer, and had to
puzzle this out from the data.

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:25.000
So, suppose we had, so if
there were going to be two

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:30.000
kinds of mutants: mutant number
one are operator constituents.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:38.000
They have a defective operator
sequence. Mutations have occurred

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:46.000
at the operator site. Mutant
number two have a defective

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:54.000
repressor protein, the gene
for the repressor protein.

00:38:54.000 --> 00:39:00.000
How can I tell
the difference?

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:04.000
So, I could have a problem
in my operator site.

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:08.000
What would be the problem
with the operator site?

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:12.000
Some mutation to the sequence
causes the repressor not to bind

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:16.000
there anymore, OK? So,
a defective operator site

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:20.000
doesn't bind repressors.
Defective repressor, the operator

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:24.000
site is just fine, but I
don't have a repressor to bind

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:28.000
at it. So how do I tell the
difference? One way to tell the

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:32.000
difference is to begin crossing
the mutants together to wild type,

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:36.000
and asking, are they dominant or
recessive, or things like that?

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:39.000
Now, here's a little problem.
E Coli is not a diploid, so you

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:43.000
can't cross together two E
colis and make a diploid E coli,

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:46.000
right? It's a prokaryote.
It only has one genome. But,

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:50.000
it turns out that you can
make temporary diploids,

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:53.000
partial diploids out of E coli
because it turns out you can mate

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:57.000
bacteria. Bacteria, which
have a bacterial chromosome

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:01.000
here also engage in sex and
in the course of bacterial sex,

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:05.000
plasmids can be transferred called,
for example, an F factor, is able to

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:10.000
be transferred from another bacteria.
And, through the wonders of partial

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:15.000
merodiploid, you can temporarily get
E colis, or you can permanently get

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:20.000
E colis, that are partially diploid.
So, you can do what I'm about to

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:25.000
say. But, in case you were worried
about my writing diploid genotypes

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:30.000
for E coli, you can
actually do this.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:36.000
You can make partial diploids.
So, let's try out a genotype here.

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:43.000
Suppose the repressor is a wild
type, the operator is wild type,

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:49.000
and the lack Z gene is wild type.
And, suppose I have no IPTG, I'm

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:56.000
un-induced. I have one unit of
beta-gal. When I add my inducer,

00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:03.000
what happens? I get
1,000 units of beta-gal.

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:07.000
Now, suppose I would have an
operator constituative mutation.

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:12.000
Then, the operator site is
defective. It doesn't bind the

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:17.000
repressor. Beta-gal is going
to be expressed all the time,

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:22.000
even in the absence. All right,
well that was, of course, what we

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:27.000
selected for. Now, suppose
I made the following diploid.

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:32.000
I plus, O plus, Z
plus, over I plus,

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:38.000
O constituative, Z plus. So,
here's my diploid. What would

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:44.000
be the phenotype?
So, in other words,

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:50.000
one of the chromosomes
has an operator problem.

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:56.000
Well, that means that this
chromosome here is always going to

00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:02.000
be constituatively
expressing beta-gal.

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:06.000
But, what about this
chromosome here? It won't. So,

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:10.000
this would be about 1, 01,
give or take, because it's got

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:14.000
one chromosome doing that
and one chromosome doing this,

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:18.000
and this one would be about
2, 00. Now, that quantitative

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:22.000
difference doesn't matter a lot.
What you really saw when you did

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:26.000
the molecular biology was that when
you had one copy of the operator

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:30.000
constituative mutation, you
still got a lot of beta-gal here

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:36.000
even in the absence of IPTG. So,
that operator constituative site

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:44.000
looked like it was dominant
to this plus site here.

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:52.000
But now, let's try this one here.
I plus, O plus, Z plus, over I plus,

00:42:52.000 --> 00:43:00.000
operator constituative, Z
minus. What happens then?

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:05.000
This operator constituative site
allows constant transcription of

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:10.000
this particular copy. But,
can this particular copy make

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:15.000
a working, functional beta-gal?
No. So, this looks, when you do

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:20.000
your genetic crosses,
you find that the operator

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:25.000
constituative, now, if
I reverse these here,

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:30.000
suppose I reverse these, I
plus, O plus, Z minus, I plus, O

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:35.000
constituative, Z
plus, same genotypes,

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:40.000
right, except that I flipped
which chromosome these are on.

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:46.000
Now, what happens? This chromosome
here: always making beta-gal and it

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:51.000
works. This chromosome
here: not making beta-gal.

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:56.000
Even though it's regulated, it's
a mutant. So, in other words,

00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:01.000
from this very experiment, you can
tell that the operator site is only

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:07.000
affecting the chromosome
that it's physically on,

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:13.000
that it doesn't make a
protein that floats around.

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:19.000
What it does is it's said to work
in cys. In cys means on the same

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:26.000
chromosome. It physically
works on the same chromosome.

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:32.000
Now, let's take a look, by
contrast, of the properties of

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:38.000
the lack repressor mutants.
If I give you a lack repressor

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:43.000
mutant, I plus, O plus,
Z plus is the wild type.

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:49.000
I constituative, O plus,
Z plus: what happens here?

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:54.000
This wild type is one in 1,
00. This guy here: 1,000 and 1,

00:44:54.000 --> 00:45:00.000
00, and then here
let's look at a diploid:

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:05.000
I plus, O plus, Z
plus, I constituative,

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:10.000
O plus, Z plus. What's the effect?
The I constituative doesn't make a

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:15.000
functioning repressor. But,
I plus makes a functioning

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:21.000
repressor. So, will
this show regulation?

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:26.000
Yeah, this will be regulated just
fine. This works out just fine,

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:32.000
and in fact it'll make 2,000,
and it'll make two copies there.

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:37.000
But again, the units
don't matter too much. And,

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:42.000
by contrast, if I give you I plus,
O plus, Z minus, and I constituative,

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:47.000
O plus, Z plus,
what will happen?

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:53.000
Here, I have my mutation
on this chromosome. But,

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:58.000
it doesn't matter because I've got
my mutation on this chromosome in

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:03.000
the repressor. I've got
a mutation on lack Z here,

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:09.000
but as long as I have a functional
copy, one functional copy of the

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:15.000
lack repressor, it works
on both chromosomes.

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:20.000
It will work on both chromosomes,
and so in other words this lack

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:26.000
repressor, one copy works on
both chromosomes. In other words,

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:32.000
it makes a product that diffuses
around, and can work on either

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:38.000
chromosome, and it's said to
work in trans, that is, across.

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:41.000
So, the operator is working in
cys. It's operating on its own

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:45.000
chromosome only. A mutation
in the operator only

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:48.000
affects the chromosome it lives
on, whereas a functional copy of the

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:52.000
lack repressor will float
around because it's a protein,

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:55.000
and that's how Jacobin
Maneaux knew the difference.

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:59.000
They proved their model by showing
that these two kinds of mutations

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:03.000
had very different properties.
Operator mutations affected only the

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:07.000
physical chromosome on which they
occurred, which of course they had

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:11.000
to infer from the genetics they did,
whereas repressor, a functional copy

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:15.000
repressor, could act on
any chromosome in the cell.

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:20.000
So, OK, we've got that. Now,
last point, what about glucose?

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:24.000
I haven't said a word about glucose.
See, this was a big deal to people.

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:28.000
This model, the repressor model,
we have this repressor. What

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:36.000
about glucose? What's
glucose doing in this picture?

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:47.000
So, glucose control: so here's
my gene. Here's my promoter,

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:58.000
P lack. Here's my
operator, beta-gal.

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:03.000
It's encoded by lack Z. You've
got all that. When this guy

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:08.000
is present, sorry,
when lactose is present,

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:13.000
the repressor comes off.
Polymerase sits down. Wait a second,

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:18.000
polymerase isn't supposed to sit
down unless there's no glucose.

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:23.000
We need another sensor to
tell if there's glucose,

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:28.000
or if there's low glucose. So,
we're going to need us a sensor

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:34.000
that tells that.
Any ideas? Yep?

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:40.000
Yeah, if you work that one through,
I don't think it quite works. But,

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:46.000
you've got the basic idea.
You're going to want another

00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:52.000
something, and it turns out
there's another site over here,

00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:58.000
OK? There's a second site on
which a completely different

00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:05.000
protein binds. And, this
protein is the cyclic AMP

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:13.000
regulatory protein, and it
so happens that in the cell,

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:20.000
when there's low amounts of glucose,
let me make sure I've got this right,

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:28.000
when there's low amounts of glucose,
what we have is high amounts of

00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:34.000
cyclic AMP. Cyclic
AMP turns out,

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:38.000
whereas lactose is used directly
as the signal, cyclic AMP is used as

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:42.000
the signal here. When the
cell has low amounts of

00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:46.000
glucose, it has high
amounts of cyclic AMP. Now,

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:50.000
what do you want your cyclic AMP to
do? How are we going to design this?

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:54.000
It's going to bind to a protein,
cyclic AMP regulatory protein, it's

00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:58.000
going to sit down, and
now what's it going to do?

00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:02.000
Is it going to
block RNA polymerase?

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:06.000
What do we want to do?
If there's low glucose,

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:10.000
high cyclic AMP, we sit down
at the site, we want to turn on

00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:15.000
transcription now, right?
So, what it's got to do is

00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:19.000
not block RNA polymerase,
but help RNA polymerase. So,

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:24.000
what it actually does is
instead of being a repressor,

00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:28.000
it's an activator. And what it does
is it makes it more attractive for

00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:32.000
RNA polymerase to bind, and
it actually does that by,

00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:36.000
actually it does it
slightly by bending the DNA.

00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:40.000
But, what it does is it makes it
easier for RNA polymerase to bind.

00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:44.000
It turns out that the promoter
is kind of a crummy promoter.

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:48.000
It's actually just like, remember
the repressor wasn't perfect; the

00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:52.000
promoter's not perfect either.
The promoter's kind of crummy.

00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:56.000
And, unless RNA polymerase gets
a little help from this other

00:50:56.000 --> 00:51:00.000
regulatory protein,
it doesn't work.

00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:04.000
We have two controls: a negative
regulator responding to an

00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:09.000
environmental cue, a positive
activator responding to

00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:13.000
an environmental cue, helping
polymerase decide whether to

00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:18.000
transcribe or not, and
basically that's how a human egg

00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:22.000
goes to a complete adult
and lives its entire life,

00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:27.000
minus a few other details.
There are some details left out,

00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:32.000
but that's a sketch of how
you turn genes on and off.

WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
So today we are going to continue
where we left off last time talking

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
more specifically about variations
on the theme of life.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
And last year I tried to do this
lecture using PowerPoint and it was

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
a total disaster so I'm going back
to the board.  You will have the

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
PowerPoint slides.
They'll be on the Web to download

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
to summarize basically what I'm
drawing on the board.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:42.000
But it will be slightly different on
the board.  But I found that for

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:50.000
this material it really doesn't work
to exclusively use the PowerPoint.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:58.000
So last time we talked about,
remember, my life on earth

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:07.000
abridged where --

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:16.000
-- we had photosynthesis making
glucose or organic carbon plus

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:25.000
oxygen?  And then the reverse of
this was respiration.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:32.000
And then we had elements cycling in

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.000
the middle.  And I said this is very,
very abbreviated of how all life on

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.000
earth works.  And so today what I'm
going to do is tell you that that's

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.000
not right.  That's grossly
oversimplified.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.000
And there are some really
interesting variations on the theme

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.000
of how to extract energy and carbon
and reducing power and electrons

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.000
from the earth's system
to create life.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000
And it's mostly microbes that have
these diverse possibilities.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000
And, again, even what I'm going to
talk to you about today is

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000
oversimplified.
If you go to a microbiology

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000
textbook you'll find just about
every possible combination of energy

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
sources, carbon sources and electron
sources in some microorganisms

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.000
somewhere to get through life.
So I'm giving you,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.000
again, the simplified version
because otherwise it gets way too

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:51.000
complicated.  So all of life needs
carbon and energy,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.000
and a lot of other elements,
too, but these are the main axis

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.000
upon which we're going to order our
universe today.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:13.000
So for carbon the choices are
inorganic or organic.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:23.000
So this would be CO2 and this might
be glucose or sugars,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:33.000
any sugars.  And then on the energy
axis they can use solar energy,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:43.000
as in photosynthesis, or they can
use chemical energy.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:54.000
And within the chemical energy
sources they can be inorganic or

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:05.000
organic like sugars, etc.
And often here you have reduced

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:16.000
compounds such as hydrogen sulfide,
ammonia, and we'll talk about these.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:27.000
So these are the ways we divide up
the possibilities for carbon and

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:36.000
energy sources to be alive.
All organisms also need to have an

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:42.000
energy currency in the cell.
And you've talked about this a lot

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:48.000
already in the biochemistry lectures
so I'm, again,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:54.000
just giving you the impressionist
view of this.  You know the details.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:00.000
This is just to get you organized.
And so all life uses

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:06.000
redox reactions.
And in your handouts for today

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:14.000
there's a primer on redox reactions
just in case you want to review that.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:22.000
And one of the key reactions we'll
talk about today is the conversion

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:30.000
of NADP.  If you put energy in you
can reduce it to NADPH.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:37.000
So that's a reduction.
And the reverse you get energy out

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:45.000
when it's oxidized.
Now, we're going to be talking

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:53.000
about oxidation and reduction today.
And then they all use ATP which

00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:01.000
you've talked a lot about here.
And the couple here is ADP.  Put

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:10.000
energy in.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:16.000
You make ATP which is a high energy
intermediate.  And in converting it

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:23.000
back to ADP that energy can be
released.  And this is used in the

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:30.000
biochemistry of the cell.
So all cells have these two energy

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:37.000
conversion processes in common.
OK, so let's look at just

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:44.000
summarizing what we're going to go
over today.  This is a summary of

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:51.000
options for life.
See also Freeman,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:58.000
Chapter 25.  There is some
discussion of this.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.000
And we can divide life here between
what we call autotrophs.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:08.000
These are organisms that can make
their own organic carbon.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.000
In other words, they can convert
carbon dioxide to organic carbon.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:19.000
Heterotrophs are organisms that can
only use organic carbon.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:24.000
They rely on the guts of other
organisms in order to

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:29.000
get through life.
And so now we're going to

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:35.000
systematically go through these
processes that fall under each one

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.000
of these.  Oxygenic photosynthesis
is the one we've been talking about

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.000
last time and in my abbreviated
version of life on earth.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:51.000
And this is carried out by
eukaryotic organisms,

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:56.000
plants, trees, etc., and also by
prokaryotic organisms.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:02.000
Those are the cyanobacteria,
microscopic photosynthetic plants.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.000
They use CO2 and sunlight.
So our first variant on this theme

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000
we'll get into is a group of
bacteria that do anoxygenic

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:15.000
photosynthesis.
Oxygenic means they evolve oxygen.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000
These guys use solar energy but
they don't evolve oxygen.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:24.000
And we'll get into how that works.
And then there's a group of

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000
organisms that still use CO2.
And in the very similar pathway the

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:34.000
Calvin Cycle is photosynthesis.
But they use chemical energy in

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:42.000
order to make these intermediates to
fix CO2.  OK, so let's talk about

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:50.000
those first.  And so we're going to
talk about the autotrophs.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:09:01.000
And all of them share this

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:11.000
pathway, CO2 to C6H12.
This would be glucose.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:21.000
And it takes ATP to run this
reaction and it also takes

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:34.000
reduced NADPH --

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:40.000
-- to run this reaction.
It also takes this enzyme ribisco

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:47.000
which you've talked about I'm sure,
ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:53.000
And this is the enzyme that
initially takes the CO2 from the

00:09:53.000 --> 00:10:00.000
atmosphere and binds it
to an organic carbon.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000
Now, in a detailed version of this
is what's called the Calvin Cycle or

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000
the Calvin/Benson Cycle.
I don't know which one your book

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:13.000
calls it.  Calvin got the Nobel
Prize but Benson was the graduate

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.000
student that did all the work,
so you should recognize that.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:22.000
Anyway, you studied this in great
deal.  But an interesting factoid is

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.000
that ribisco is the most abundant
protein on earth.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000
That tells you how important this
reaction is for sustaining

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:36.000
life on earth.
So notice that in order to drive

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:43.000
this reaction,
which is the Calvin Cycle,

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:50.000
it requires energy and reducing
power.  So where do they get it?

00:10:50.000 --> 00:11:14.000
Well, there are three ways that

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:20.000
autotrophs can get energy and
reducing power to drive this

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:27.000
reaction.  And the first is oxygenic
photosynthesis.  And the

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:34.000
second is anoxygenic.
And the third is chemosynthesis.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:41.000
OK, those first three there.  So
now we're going to go through each

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:49.000
of these and look at how they work
remembering that all of them are

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:56.000
generating ATP and NADPH in order to
drive that.  So all of the

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:02.000
autotrophs have that in common.
Well, oxygenic photosynthesis is the

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.000
one that you know well already.
You've studied it in great detail

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:11.000
in biochemistry.
So we're going to,

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.000
again, give you the abbreviated
version here just so you have a

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:20.000
template to map these
other ones onto.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:38.000
These are what are known as the

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:45.000
light reactions of photosynthesis,
the Z scheme taking solar energy,

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:51.000
splitting water,
evolving oxygen and synthesizing ATP

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:58.000
and NADPH.  This is all familiar,
right?  Very familiar.  I'm just

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:06.000
writing it in a cartoon version.
OK, so this is the NADPH and ADP

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:17.000
that goes to fuel that process.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:22.000
OK, so now, well,
at least I can do it on that board.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:28.000
Let me do it on this board.
Anoxygenic --

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:39.000
-- is almost exactly like this

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:47.000
process, but instead of splitting
water these guys oxidize hydrogen

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:55.000
sulfide.  So here's
our ATP and NADPH.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:03.000
And they use sunlight to do this.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:09.000
So these are called photosynthetic
bacteria.  And they were around very

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:15.000
early on the earth.
Long before the earth's atmosphere

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:21.000
was oxygenated these were the guys
that were able to use solar energy

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:27.000
and make organic carbon but without
evolving oxygen.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:32.000
Then somewhere along the line some
cell evolved, had some mutations and

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:37.000
somehow figured out that water,
this abundant source of water was a

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:43.000
much better electron donor than
hydrogen sulfide.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:48.000
And once the biochemistry figured
this out, you can see the simple

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:54.000
substitution here,
the whole earth started going in a

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:59.000
different direction.
So this is an interesting example

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:05.000
of how a small biochemical
innovation can dramatically change

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:10.000
the whole nature of the planet.
Now, these guys are still around on

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:14.000
earth.  In fact,
I'm going to show you some.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:19.000
I'll explain this at the end,
but I have some captured in here.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:24.000
See that little purple band?  Those
are those guys.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:29.000
I've got other little tricks in
here but I'll save those.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:34.000
Well, you cannot really see the
purple band.  But you can come up

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:39.000
later and look at it.
Those are photosynthetic bacteria.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:44.000
So they're still around on the
earth but they're stuck in places

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:49.000
where there's no oxygen.
So they have a rather restricted

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:54.000
niche on the planet now,
but they're still extremely

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:59.000
important.  What did I
do?  Oh, here it is.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.000
So one of the places that they can
be found, and if you're interested

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:08.000
in them a great place to go find
some is out at the Mystic Lakes in

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:13.000
Arlington which is a permanently
stratified lake so the bottom of the

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:18.000
lake is always anaerobic.
There's never oxygen there.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:23.000
In a typical lake like that you
have a lot of mud on the bottom and

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:28.000
you have a lot of hydrogen sulfide
coming out of the mud from bacterial

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:34.000
processes that we'll talk about.
And you have light here.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:41.000
And so you have a gradient here of
this is oxygen and this is H2S.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:49.000
And these photosynthetic bacteria
have to life somewhere where there's

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:56.000
enough light to photosynthesize and
enough hydrogen sulfide to use in

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:02.000
this part of the reaction.
But they're very sensitive to oxygen

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.000
so they cannot be in the oxygenated
part of the lake.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:11.000
So you find them in a layer.
It's called the squeeze.  They have

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:16.000
to have light so they have to be up,
but they cannot have oxygen so they

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.000
have to be down.
And they need hydrogen sulfide so

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:25.000
they have to be down.
So they're layered in lakes.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:30.000
OK.  So what about these guys,
chemosynthesis?

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:36.000
They don't rely on solar energy.
Again, they're still driving the

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:42.000
Calvin Cycle reducing CO2 from the
air into organic carbon,

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:48.000
but they're not using sunlight.
So what do they do?  They get their

00:17:48.000 --> 00:18:02.000
energy --

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:16.000
-- from redox reactions.
And let's just show you an example.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:27.000
Redox reactions couple to the

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:37.000
conversion of oxygen to H2O.
So oxygen is involved in these

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:47.000
reactions.  And one organism,
for example, can take ammonia and

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:57.000
convert it to nitrite.
Another type of organism can take

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:07.000
nitrite and convert it to nitrate.
And there are other organisms that

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:17.000
can take hydrogen sulfide and
convert it to sulfate.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:27.000
And some can take hydrogen sulfide,
oh, no, take iron, ferrous iron,

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:35.000
Fe2+ and convert it to Fe3+.
So in all of these cases what is

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:42.000
happening to these compounds?
Are they being oxidized or reduced?

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:49.000
I heard an oxidized.  Yes, they're
being oxidized.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:56.000
So these reduced compounds,
relatively reduced compounds can be

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:03.000
utilized by oxidizing them.
The organism can release the energy

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:10.000
that's needed.  ATP
is generated here.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:25.000
And NADPH is generated by any of

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:31.000
these redox couples.
So using this energy then the cell

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:39.000
takes the reduced NADPH and the ATP
and it runs the Calvin Cycle,

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:46.000
chemosynthesis.  OK.  Now, you may
think that these are kind of strange,

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:54.000
weird bacteria that life in strange
pockets of the earth where there's

00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:00.000
no oxygen.  And who cares anyway?
They're outdated.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:04.000
They dominated the earth way back
in the early stages of the earth but

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:09.000
they're not so important now.
Well, that's not true.  They're

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:14.000
incredibly important.
In some ecosystems they're the

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:18.000
total base of the entire ecosystem.
But also on a global scale, as

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:23.000
you'll learn, you should have a
feeling for this by the end of this

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:28.000
lecture, but also when we talk about
global biogeochemical cycles you

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:32.000
will learn that these microbes are
really messengers for electrons in

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:37.000
the environment.
Without them the redox balance of

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:41.000
the earth would not be maintained,
OK?  You cannot have nothing but

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:46.000
oxidizing reactions or nothing but
reduction reactions and have a

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:50.000
system sustain itself.
So it's these microbes that are

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.000
playing a really important role in
maintaining the redox balance

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:59.000
of the earth.  OK.
Now, one system that I'm going to

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:04.000
show you in that DVD,
that will do much better justice to

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:09.000
it than my drawings here,
that's a deep-sea volcano in case

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:15.000
you didn't recognize it.
And this is 2500 meters at the

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:20.000
bottom of the ocean,
very, very deep.  And there is

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:25.000
intense heat.  I mean just think of
a volcano on the surface

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:31.000
of the earth.
Intense heat and reduced compounds

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:37.000
are found in the earth's mantle that
are ready to erupt through this

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:44.000
deep-sea volcano.
And you have sulfate in the sea

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:50.000
water that percolates through here.
And as it percolates in and gets

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:57.000
draw into the volcanic stuff that's
coming out of here it's reduced to

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:04.000
hydrogen sulfide coming
out of the volcano.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:08.000
But you have oxygen in the water in
the deep-sea. And we'll be talking

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:12.000
about this when we talk about ocean
circulation.  But the oceans have a

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:16.000
global ocean circulation where the
surface water that's in equilibrium

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:21.000
with the atmosphere actually sinks
and travels along the bottom of the

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:25.000
ocean.  So there is oxygen in the
bottom of the ocean,

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:30.000
unlike many lakes where you don't
have oxygen.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:37.000
And we'll talk about that difference.
And in the hot vents the water

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:44.000
coming out of here can be very,
very hot, but there's a gradient

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:51.000
right as it comes out meeting the
colder sea water.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:58.000
And so what you have here is a
perfect incubator for chemosynthetic

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:07.000
bacteria --

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:12.000
-- that use the hydrogen sulfide in
chemosynthesis to fix carbon dioxide

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:18.000
using the oxygen here.
And that forms the base of the

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:23.000
entire food web in the deep ocean
because there's no light down there.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:29.000
There's no photosynthesis.  There's
only chemosynthesis.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:35.000
And just a little story that goes
back to when I first came to MIT as

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:41.000
an assistant professor in 1976.
You weren't even born.  But when I

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:47.000
was young we used to go the Muddy
Charles Pub periodically after work

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:53.000
and have beers.
And there was a professor,

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:59.000
in this department actually,
John Edmond, who passed away several

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:05.000
years ago but who used to be there.
It was sort of like our Cheers.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:11.000
And I'll never forget the day he
came back from a cruise.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:17.000
He came to the pub.  He was a
chemist and I'm a biologist.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:23.000
And he said you will not believe
what we found on the bottom of the

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:29.000
ocean.  He had gone down in Alvin,
this two-person submersible vehicle.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:33.000
And he started talking about these
giant clams and these giant tube

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:38.000
worms and all of these things,
and I thought he had had one too

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:43.000
many beers.  I found it hard to
believe.  Well,

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:48.000
it turned out that that was the
first discovery of these deep-sea

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:53.000
vents and he was on that expedition.
And through that collegial

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:58.000
relationship I actually ended up
with one of the clam shells from the

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:03.000
clams there, which is one
of the giant clams.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:08.000
Their meat is blood red because they
have a special kind of hemoglobin

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:13.000
that they use to keep the oxygen
tension perfect for these

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:18.000
chemosynthetic bacteria.
If the oxygen is too high they

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:23.000
cannot do this because it will
spontaneously oxidize the H2S.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:29.000
So the oxygen tension is very
critical.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:32.000
And they have a special kind of
hemoglobin that does that.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:36.000
So these claims had symbiotic
chemosynthetic bacteria.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:40.000
Well, since then these vents have
been discovered everywhere and

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:44.000
ecosystems similar have been
discovered on the surface.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:48.000
And there are all kinds of
different vents.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:52.000
You're going to learn about not
only hydrothermal vents,

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:56.000
hot vents in this video, but also
cold seeps they're called where you

00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:00.000
have methane bacteria that are
really important.  OK.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:05.000
So these are the main ways in which
organisms can get energy to convert

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:11.000
CO2 to organic carbon.
Then you have all these

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:17.000
heterotrophs, the ones that use the
organic carbon,

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:23.000
and they have various ways of doing
that.  You've learned in

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:29.000
biochemistry the primary way,
which is very powerful, and that is

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:35.000
using aerobic respiration
to do that.

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:44.000
And so we are just going to
abbreviate that here.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:54.000
That's our reverse of
photosynthesis.  So heterotrophs.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:28:03.000
So we have first aerobic.

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:13.000
And let me jump ahead

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:25.000
with the slides.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:32.000
OK, there you are.
So this is a cartoon version of

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:40.000
aerobic respiration.
So we'll just put glucose,

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:47.000
we'll come down to the Krebs' Cycle.
And we are going to let electrons

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:55.000
flow here and have oxygen be the
final electron acceptor

00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:02.000
creating water.
So we've really just accomplished

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:09.000
the absolute reverse of
photosynthesis and we've made NADH

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:16.000
in doing this and we've made ATP.
So these guys are getting the

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:22.000
energy out of the glucose that all
of the other organisms made.

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:29.000
And oxygen is the terminal electron
acceptor when there's

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:35.000
oxygen around.
But there are lots of environments,

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:41.000
as we've talked about on earth,
where there isn't oxygen.

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:46.000
And there are bacteria that can
take advantage of those environments.

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:52.000
And instead of having oxygen be the
terminal electron acceptor there are

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:57.000
a number of other elements that they
can use, compounds that they can use.

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:03.000
For example, there are some that
use nitrate and they reduce

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:10.000
it to nitrous oxide.
N2.  Ammonia.  All the relatively

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:19.000
reduced forms of nitrogen.
And so this called anaerobic.

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:29.000
And this process is called

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:36.000
gentrification.
And if it weren't for these bacteria,

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:40.000
these anaerobic bacteria that can
reduce nitrate,

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:44.000
nitrogen would never return to the
atmosphere.  Remember last time we

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:48.000
talked about nitrogen fixation,
how specific types of microbes can

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:52.000
take N2 from the atmosphere and pull
it into the ecosystem?

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:56.000
Well, if you didn't have these
bacteria doing this process that

00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:00.000
nitrogen would never get
back to the atmosphere.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:04.000
They're central to closing the
nitrogen cycle.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:08.000
Then there are some that can use
sulfate and reduce it to hydrogen

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:13.000
sulfide.  As you can imagine,
these are critical to creating the

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:17.000
hydrogen sulfide that's used in
these other processes.

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:22.000
There are some that use CO2 and
convert to methane.

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:26.000
These are methanogenic bacteria,
and they're incredibly important in

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:31.000
the global carbon cycle and
in the methane cycle.

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:36.000
Methane is a really powerful
greenhouse gas,

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:42.000
and we're going to talk about that
later.  And then there are some that

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:48.000
can take Fe3+ and reduce it to Fe2+.
And the same for manganese.

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:55.000
So you should be starting to sense a

00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:00.000
sort of symmetry here,
right, that these anaerobic bacteria

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:05.000
are fulfilling functions on the
earth.  Let me write these down.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:17.000
These are sulfate reducers,
these are methanogens, and these are

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:30.000
iron reducers and manganese
reducers.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:37.000
So these will all become extremely
important when we talk about the

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:44.000
global biogeochemical cycles of all
of these elements.

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:51.000
It's these microbes that make sure
that the cycles can continue and

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:58.000
don't run into a dead end of
oxidation or reduction.

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:05.000
OK.  Before we go to the movie,
I just want to say if you look at

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:12.000
Table 25.2 in your textbook,
I think it's that one.

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:18.000
I'm assuming I'm using the most
recent version.

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:24.000
You'll see a variation of this
theme in which there will be some

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:30.000
entries of organisms that don't fall
into these categories that

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:36.000
I've just shown you.
And that is to say that there are

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:41.000
organisms that use light energy and
organic carbon energy at the same

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:46.000
time.  For every variation that's
possible there's an organism that's

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:51.000
evolved to take advantage of it.
I've just oversimplified it here,

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:56.000
but you should know that.  And the
bottom line is if it's

00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:01.000
thermodynamically possible.
And, again, this whole lecture could

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:06.000
have been done in a thermodynamic
mode.  We could have looked at which

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:12.000
redox couples were energetically
possible and then assigned those to

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:17.000
particular microbes.
But for now I just want you to get

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:22.000
the overview.  But for anything
that's thermodynamically feasible

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:28.000
there's a microbe out there
that's doing it.

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:32.000
And, in fact, microbiologists
actually comb through redox tables

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:37.000
and put together different redox
couples and hypothesize.

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:41.000
I ought to be able to find an
organism that does this in that

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:46.000
environment.  And then they go out.
And they can almost always actually

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:50.000
find it.  So they're incredibly
versatile.  And it gives you a

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:55.000
really good strong feeling for the
power of thermodynamics in driving

00:34:55.000 --> 00:35:00.000
the evolution of these biochemical
processes.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:07.000
Finally, before we show you the
movie I want to show you what this

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:15.000
thing is all about.
There was a Russian microbiologist

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:23.000
back in the previous century
named Winogradsky --

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:33.000
-- who wanted to isolate some of

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:39.000
these photosynthetic bacteria.
And knowing what their

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:45.000
characteristics were he went out and
got himself some mud and some pond

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:52.000
water.  And he set up what we've
come to call a Winogradsky column.

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:58.000
This is a Winogradsky juice bottle,
but it works the same.  And what you

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:05.000
do is you put mud in the bottom and
you put pond water here.

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:09.000
And the pond water has basically an
inoculum.  It has representatives of

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:13.000
all different types of bacteria.
They might be spores.  If they

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:17.000
don't like the environment they're
in they sporulates and then they

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:21.000
just don't germinate.
But presumably in pond water you

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:25.000
have everything that could possibly
grow in here.  And in the mud you

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:29.000
add a source of sulfate.
And so you might add calcium

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:33.000
sulfate and you might add a little
organic matter,

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:38.000
you know, plant parts or something
just to jumpstart it.

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:45.000
And eventually you set up a gradient
here of hydrogen sulfide and oxygen.

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:53.000
And over time the organisms grow
along that gradient.

00:36:53.000 --> 00:37:01.000
So you'll end up down here with the
anaerobic respiration.

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:08.000
In fact, the organisms generate this

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:12.000
gradient.  When you start out the
whole thing is oxygenated.

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:16.000
And what you should think about in
this context is what happens.

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:20.000
How do these gradients get
generated when you start out with a

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:24.000
completely mixed system,
everything in there, everything

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:29.000
oxygenated?  Eventually
you have anaerobic --

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:33.000
First you'll just have anaerobic
respiration, right?

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:38.000
Anything that can use organic
carbon and oxygen is going to go

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:42.000
like mad, and that's what's going to
draw the oxygen down.

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:47.000
Then you'll have anaerobic
respiration here.

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:51.000
You'll have photosynthesis up here,
evolving oxygen.  You'll have

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:56.000
chemosynthetic bacteria here because
they need a little bit of oxygen but

00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:00.000
they also need some of this hydrogen
sulfide and photosynthetic

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:07.000
bacteria here.

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:11.000
Well, they're like down here.
Because they need light but cannot

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:16.000
have oxygen.  And so you can set
these up.  And this purple band here

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:19.000
tells you that you've got your
photosynthetic bacteria.

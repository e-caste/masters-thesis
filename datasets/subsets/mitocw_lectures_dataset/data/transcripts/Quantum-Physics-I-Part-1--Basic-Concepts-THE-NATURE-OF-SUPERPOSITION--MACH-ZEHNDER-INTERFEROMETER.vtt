WEBVTT

00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:07.050
PROFESSOR: Superposition is very
unusual and very interesting.

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:13.060
Now we've said
about superposition

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:17.290
that in classical physics, when
we talk about superposition

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:20.500
we have electric fields, and
you add the electric fields,

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.540
and the total electric field
is the sum of electric fields,

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:24.920
and it's an electric field.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.000
And there's nothing
strange about it.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.880
The nature of superposition
in quantum mechanics

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.020
is very strange.

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:38.460
So nature of superposition--

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:47.150
I will illustrate it in a
couple of different ways.

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.890
One way is with a device that
we will get accustomed to.

00:00:50.890 --> 00:01:06.180
It it's called the
Mach-Zehnder interferometer,

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:16.130
which is a device with
a beam splitter in here.

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.320
You send in a beam of light--

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:27.320
input- beam splitter
and then the light--

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.340
indeed half of it gets
reflected, half of it

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:31.500
gets transmitted.

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:36.750
Then you put the mirror here--

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.840
mirror 1, you put
the mirror 2 here,

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.085
and this gets recombined
into another beam splitter.

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.750
And then if there would
be just a light going in,

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.080
here there would be
two things going out.

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.390
There's another one
coming from the bottom.

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:01.140
There will be two.

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.200
There will be interference.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:09.509
So you put a detector
D0 here and a detector

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:15.430
E1 here to detect the light.

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.230
So that's the sketch of the
Mach-Zehnder interferometer--

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:25.680
beam splitters and mirrors.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:33.430
Take a beam, spit the light, go
down, up, and then recombine it

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:34.920
and go into detectors.

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.620
This was invented
by these two people,

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:50.640
independently, in the 1890s--

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.455
'91 to '92 apparently.

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.560
And people did this with light--

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:07.880
beams of light before they
realized they're photons.

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:12.800
And what happens with a beam
of light-- it's interesting--

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.660
comes a beam of light.

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:20.060
The beam splitter sends half
of the light one way half

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.320
of the light the other way.

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.330
You already know with
quantum mechanics

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:28.280
that's going to be probabilistic
some photons will go up maybe

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:33.020
some photons will go down
or something more strange

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:35.740
can happen.

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:39.280
If you have a
superposition, some photons

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:44.340
may go both up and down.

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.080
So that's what can happen
in quantum mechanics.

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:51.590
If you send the beam,
classical physics,

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:54.490
it divides half and
half and then combines.

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:57.020
And there's an
interference effect here.

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:01.250
And we will design this
interferometer in such a way

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:05.390
that sometimes we can produce
an interference that everything

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:09.020
goes to D0 or
everything goes to D1

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:12.470
or we can produce suitable
interferences that we

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:16.040
can get fractions of the
power going into D1 and D2--

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.790
D0 and D1.

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:23.690
So we can do it
in different ways,

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:28.400
but we should think of
this as a single photon.

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.340
Single photos going
one at a time.

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:35.990
You see, whatever light you
put in here, experimentally,

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:39.420
the same frequency
goes out here.

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:41.330
So what is interference?

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:45.910
You might think, intuitively,
that interference

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:52.510
is one photon interfering with
another one, but it can't be.

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:57.520
If two photos would interfere
in a canceling, destructive

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.725
interference, you will
have a bunch of energy.

00:04:59.725 --> 00:05:01.030
It goes into nothing.

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:03.760
It's impossible.

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.650
If they would interfere
constructively,

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:08.800
you would add the
electric fields

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.760
and the amplitude would be
four times as big because it's

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:14.410
proportional to the square.

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:17.440
But two photos are not
going to go to four photons.

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.990
It cannot conserve energy.

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:24.850
So first of all, when you
get light interference,

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:27.710
each photon is
interfering with itself.

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:35.010
It sounds crazy, but it's
the only possibility.

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:37.900
They cannot interfere
with each other.

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:41.520
You can send the
photons one at a time

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:46.440
and, therefore, each
photon will have

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:50.500
to be in both beams
at the same time.

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:54.210
And then, each photon
as it goes along,

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:56.070
there will be an
interference effect,

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:59.580
and the photon may end
up here or end up there

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:02.200
in a probabilistic way.

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:05.150
So you have an example
of superposition.

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:10.320
Superposition.

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:18.250
A single photon
state a single photon

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:30.350
is equal to superposition of
a photon in the upper beam

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:34.030
and a photon in the lower beam.

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:41.210
It's like two different states--

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:43.220
a little different
from here, you

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:46.380
had photons in two
different polarizations

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:49.350
states superposed.

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:52.080
Here you have photons
in two different beams--

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:56.130
a single photon is in both
beams at the same time.

00:06:56.130 --> 00:07:01.440
And unless you have that, you
cannot get a superposition

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:05.970
and an interference that is
consistent with experiment.

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:11.700
So what does that mean
for superpositions?

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:17.400
Well, it means something
that we can discuss,

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:20.390
and I can say things
that, at this moment,

00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:26.230
may not make too
much sense, but it

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:30.730
would be a good idea that you
think about them a little bit.

00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:33.170
We associated
states with vectors.

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:38.800
States and vectors
are the same thing.

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:42.550
And it so happens that
when you have vectors,

00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:48.410
you can write them as
the sum of other vectors.

00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:51.590
So the sum of these two
vectors may be this vector.

00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:54.860
But you can also write it as
the sum of these two vectors--

00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:57.020
these two vectors
add to the state.

00:07:57.020 --> 00:08:02.720
And you can write any vector
as a sum of different vectors,

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:04.790
and that's, actually,
quite relevant.

00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:08.240
You will be doing that
during the semester--

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:12.680
writing a state a superposition
of different things.

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:14.570
And in that way
you will understand

00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:16.140
the physics of those states.

00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:20.570
So for example, we can
think of two states--

00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:26.660
A and B. And you see, as I
said, states wave functions,

00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:27.170
vectors--

00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:29.930
we're all calling
them the same thing.

00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:43.010
If you have a superposition
of the states A and B,

00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:45.740
what can happen?

00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:48.470
All right, we'll do
it the following way.

00:08:48.470 --> 00:09:04.190
Let's assume if you
measure some property on A,

00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:12.260
you always get value A. So you
measure something-- position,

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:19.060
momentum, angular momentum,
spin, energy, something--

00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:22.770
on A, it states
that you always get

00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:31.730
A. Suppose you measured the
same property on B. You always

00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:34.860
get B as the value.

00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:46.060
And now suppose you have a
quantum mechanical state,

00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:52.690
and the state is
alpha A plus beta B--

00:09:52.690 --> 00:09:56.230
it's a superposition.

00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:59.220
This is your state.

00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:08.410
You superimpose A and B. And
now you measure that property.

00:10:08.410 --> 00:10:10.810
That same property you
could measure here,

00:10:10.810 --> 00:10:12.375
you measure it in your state.

00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:19.650
The question is,
what will you get?

00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:22.230
You've now superimpose
those states.

00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:25.620
On the first state, you always
get A; on the second state,

00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:29.490
you always get B. What do you
get on the superimposed states,

00:10:29.490 --> 00:10:31.405
where alpha and
beta are numbers--

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:35.880
complex numbers in general?

00:10:38.770 --> 00:10:42.340
Well the most, perhaps,
immediate guess

00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:44.950
is that you would get
something in-between

00:10:44.950 --> 00:10:51.680
maybe alpha A plus beta B
or an average or something.

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:55.010
But no, that's not what
happens in quantum mechanics.

00:10:55.010 --> 00:11:03.540
In quantum mechanics, you always
get A or you always get B.

00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:06.180
So you can do the
experiment many times,

00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:11.400
and you will get A many times,
and you may get B many times.

00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:15.090
But you never get
something intermediate.

00:11:15.090 --> 00:11:18.180
So this is very different
than in classical physics.

00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:20.972
If a wave has some
amplitudes and you

00:11:20.972 --> 00:11:22.680
add another wave of
different amplitudes,

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:25.655
you measure the energy you
get something intermediate.

00:11:25.655 --> 00:11:26.880
Here not!

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:32.220
You make the superposition and
as you measure you will either

00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:35.580
get the little a
or the little b but

00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:37.770
with different probabilities.

00:11:37.770 --> 00:11:44.340
So roughly speaking, the
probability to get little a

00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:51.360
is proportional to the number in
front of here is alpha squared,

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:55.230
and the probability
to measure little b

00:11:55.230 --> 00:11:58.790
is proportional to beta squared.

00:11:58.790 --> 00:12:04.790
So in a quantum superposition,
a single measurement

00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:09.590
doesn't yield an average result
or an intermediate result.

00:12:09.590 --> 00:12:12.720
It leads one or the other.

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:17.600
And this should
connect with this.

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:20.700
Think of the photon we
were talking about before.

00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:24.800
If you think of the photon
that was at an angle

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:31.700
alpha in this way, you could say
that the polarizer is measuring

00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:34.360
the polarization of the object.

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:37.850
And therefore, what
is the possible result

00:12:37.850 --> 00:12:42.380
it may measure the
polarizations say oh, if it's

00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:46.580
in the x direction
you get it right,

00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:48.680
and what is the
probability that you get

00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:52.490
it to be in the x direction is
proportional to cosine squared

00:12:52.490 --> 00:12:55.230
alpha-- the coefficient
here squared.

00:12:55.230 --> 00:12:57.950
So the probability that
you find the photon

00:12:57.950 --> 00:13:00.650
after measuring
in the x direction

00:13:00.650 --> 00:13:03.590
is closer in squared
alpha, and the probability

00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:07.200
that you'll find that here
is sine squared alpha.

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:10.910
And after you measure,
you get this state which

00:13:10.910 --> 00:13:13.380
is to say the following thing.

00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:18.540
The probability to get the
value A is alpha squared,

00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:33.920
but if you get A,
the state becomes A

00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:38.840
because this whole state
of the system becomes that.

00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:42.890
Because successive measurements
will keep giving you the value

00:13:42.890 --> 00:13:51.410
A. If you get B,
the state becomes

00:13:51.410 --> 00:13:56.025
B. So this is what is called
the postulate of measurement

00:13:56.025 --> 00:13:58.400
and the nature of superposition.

00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:01.130
This is perhaps the
most sophisticated idea

00:14:01.130 --> 00:14:06.590
we've discussed today, in which
in a quantum superposition

00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:10.160
the results are
not intermediate.

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:13.580
So when you want to figure
out what state you have,

00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:17.660
you have to prepare many
copies of your state

00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:21.230
in this quantum system and
do the experiment many times.

00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:23.480
Because sometimes you'll
get A, sometimes you'll

00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:26.150
get B. After you've
measured many times,

00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:31.780
you can assess the probabilities
and reconstruct the state.

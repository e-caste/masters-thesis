00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:26.510
PROFESSOR: We began our
discussion by talking about

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:29.550
how society would choose
across different income

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:36.180
distributions, which involve
the trade-off between

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.750
preferences for more equal
distribution of income and the

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.340
efficiency cost of transferring
income through

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.300
both taxation and welfare
programs. We then moved on to

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.680
talk about what the government
does in practice in terms of

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.020
taxation and income
redistribution.

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.390
What we're going to do today is
actually recognize that, in

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.780
fact, most of government
spending, most of what we

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.160
raise taxes for is not pure
income redistribution.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.780
We talked about things like the
TANF program, which gives

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.180
money to single mothers, or the
SSI program, which gives

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:08.850
money to disabled people.

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.980
That's not most of what the
government raises money for.

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:17.830
In fact, 95% of the transfers
that the government makes are

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:19.155
not income based transfers.

00:01:19.155 --> 00:01:23.630
They're transfers of what we
call social insurance.

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:31.166
So most of what the government
does today is not take from

00:01:31.166 --> 00:01:32.620
the rich and give to the poor.

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:34.670
Most of what the government
does today is take from

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.160
everyone to provide insurance
for everyone.

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:44.990
Now basically, we talked in the
uncertainty lecture about

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.960
why people would value
insurance.

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.170
So essentially we think about
people choosing across states

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.780
of nature like they're choosing
across goods.

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.770
Then they will want to optimize
across those states,

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.870
hit by a car versus not hit by
a car, the way they optimize

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:04.200
across goods like
CDs and movies.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.430
And we said the way they
optimize across states is by

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:07.340
buying insurance.

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.750
That's the way you essentially
transfer resources from the

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.230
state where something goes
bad to the state

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:11.880
where something goes--

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.300
I'm sorry, from the state where
something goes good to

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:15.260
the state where it goes bad.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.740
The way you effect that
transfer, effectively, is by

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:20.660
paying insurers when things go
good and getting from insurers

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:21.960
when things go bad.

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.340
That's insurance, and insurance
is an enormous share

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:26.230
of the US economy.

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.200
Currently, US as a whole spends
about $2 trillion a

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.050
year on insuring ourselves
against adverse risks of

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:34.250
various types.

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.340
There's health insurance, which
is money we pay up front

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.280
to insurers, and they cover our
medical costs should we

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.290
get sick or become injured.

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:48.160
There's disability insurance,
which is money that you pay in

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.570
the form of taxation, and the
government uses that money to

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.660
give you a benefit should
you become disabled.

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.420
There's unemployment
insurance.

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:57.180
We know about that.

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.990
Unemployment insurance is money
that your employer pays

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:04.230
in taxes, and in return, should
you lose your job due

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.430
to a layoff you receive income
when you're laid off.

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.370
That's certainly a topic
of much conversation

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.540
these days, et cetera.

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.340
So there are a number of social
insurance programs that

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.990
are out there to help
individuals with the adverse

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:20.510
risks they face.

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.080
The big question we have to ask
in starting this lecture

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.090
is, well, why does social
insurance exist?

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.070
After all, there's actually
an enormous robust private

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.890
insurance market.

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.320
There's health insurance,
there's life insurance,

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:38.170
there's casualty insurance.

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.600
The private market insures
us for lots of risks.

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.750
The question is why does the
government come in and also

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.700
provide us this social
insurance?

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:51.855
So we individuals will demand
insurance for risk.

00:03:51.855 --> 00:03:55.120
We know private insurance exists
for things like health

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.070
insurance, life insurance, fire

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:58.560
insurance, auto insurance.

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.680
We know it exists, and that adds
up to about $2 trillion

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.470
of private spending.

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:07.540
Yet at the same time the
government also provides on

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.380
the order of another trillion
dollars of social insurance

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:13.250
spending every year for things
like health insurance, and

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:15.120
disability, and other things.

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.820
So the issue is why does the
government need to do that?

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:19.430
Why does the government
need to roll

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:20.769
in and provide insurance?

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:22.280
We know individuals want it.

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:25.230
We know a private market exists
that provides it.

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:28.360
What's the market failure
that justifies a

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.620
government role here?

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:33.300
Think about the role of the
government in the economy--

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.810
and this is a very small
part of this course--

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:39.000
but the focus of the other
course I teach, 14.41.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.010
The basic question is in this
course we've largely learned

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:45.640
the governments serves to screw
up the market if the

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:47.090
market's working well.

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:49.340
The only time the government
can help is if there's a

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:51.350
market failure, if
there's something

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:52.530
wrong with the market.

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:56.090
Well in this case, what could
the market failure be?

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:59.030
And the market failure, in the
context of insurance, is the

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:00.660
problem of asymmetric
information.

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:10.070
Asymmetric information,
information that is held

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:12.250
differentially between parties
on either side of a

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:13.500
transaction.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.860
And that when there's asymmetric
information, when

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:19.910
different parties know different
amounts about a

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:26.080
transaction, that can lead
to market failures.

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.210
So the classic example of this
comes from the Nobel Prize

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:31.120
winning economist
George Akerlof.

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.990
It's called the lemons
problem.

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:38.330
The lemons problem is,
basically, he did the example

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:39.930
of the used car market.

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:42.600
Imagine you've got a used car
market, which is a set of

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:45.670
individuals who want to sell
their cars and a set of

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:48.840
individuals who want
to buy those cars.

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:51.220
And let's start with the full
information benchmark.

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:54.490
Let's imagine there was perfect
information about the

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:56.360
exact quality of every car.

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:58.640
Imagine there was some test
you could do which would

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:01.040
perfectly tell you exactly how
long the car is going to last,

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:03.110
how well it's going
to run, et cetera.

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:05.680
In that world there will be
a set of transactions.

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:07.530
Some individuals will want to
sell their cars because they

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:09.290
want to buy up, other individual
will be happy to

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:12.980
pay that price, there will
be a set of transactions.

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:16.340
Now imagine we go to the real
world, especially a real world

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:19.065
when Akerlof wrote his article
in the '70s when, basically,

00:06:19.065 --> 00:06:21.210
if you went to buy a used car
you had to look at it and

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:23.470
decide does it look OK.

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:25.420
There's clearly asymmetric
information.

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:28.860
Clearly the seller of the car
knows much more about its

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:31.990
underlying qualities than
the buyer of the car.

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:34.050
And in particular, the buyer
should be suspicious saying,

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:36.820
wait a second, why are
you selling this car?

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:40.250
If it's such a good car why
are you selling it?

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:42.570
And the very fact that I see
you selling it makes me

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:45.340
suspicious that something's
wrong with it.

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:48.110
Given that I'm suspicious
something's wrong with it I'm

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:50.930
going to be willing to pay less
for it than I would if I

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:53.950
knew for sure it was OK.

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:57.070
The fact that I don't have full
information as a buyer

00:06:57.070 --> 00:07:00.210
means that I'm going to pay less
for it than I would if I

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:02.480
had full information.

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:05.360
Well if I'm going to pay less
for it but the seller has a

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:07.266
certain amount he's willing to
sell it at, the seller will

00:07:07.266 --> 00:07:08.680
say, well, I'm not going to
sell it to you for less.

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:10.975
I have a certain supply curve
at which I want to sell.

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:16.940
If I can get x for the car I'll
sell it, but if you're

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:19.150
not going to pay me x I'm
not going to sell it.

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:21.520
So the sale doesn't happen.

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:24.240
So what you have is a car where
in a full information

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:27.050
world a sale would happen, both
parties would be happy

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:27.990
with that sale.

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:29.830
But in an asymmetric information
world, since the

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:33.640
first party, since the buyer's
suspicious of the quality and

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:36.180
is therefore willing to pay
less, and the seller won't

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:38.420
accept less the sale
doesn't happen.

00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:40.820
And that's a market failure.

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:43.790
Relative to the 14.01 world we
started with, where everybody

00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:46.070
knows everything, where there's
full information, the

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:48.330
market has failed because sales
which would make both

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:51.230
parties better off do not
occur due to asymmetric

00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:52.480
information.

00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:57.690
So that is an example of the
market failure caused by

00:07:57.690 --> 00:08:00.640
asymmetric information.

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:04.840
Now let's flip this around
and talk about insurance.

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:07.760
In insurance it's the
opposite case.

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:11.770
In insurance, I, the person
demanding the insurance, know

00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:14.255
more about me than the insurers

00:08:14.255 --> 00:08:16.330
who's selling me insurance.

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:20.430
I know whether I'm someone who
gets sick a lot, whether I

00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:22.980
like skydiving, whether I
engage in other risky

00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:27.480
behaviors that may have health
problems for me, whether I am

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:29.790
someone who smokes in bed so I'm
likely to catch my house

00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:32.890
on fire so that I really want
house insurance because I'm

00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:34.289
going to catch my house
on fire, et cetera.

00:08:34.289 --> 00:08:37.770
I know all that stuff about
me, the insurer doesn't.

00:08:37.770 --> 00:08:41.630
So the insurer, as a result,
might be unwilling to sell me

00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:44.650
insurance at a fair price.

00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:48.860
So to put this in numbers, let's
consider an example.

00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:57.370
Imagine that you are starting up
a health insurance program

00:08:57.370 --> 00:08:59.460
for MIT graduates.

00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:01.600
You want to say look, MIT
graduates are a pretty healthy

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:05.520
lot, and so I'm going to start
up a health insurance program

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:06.010
for MIT graduates.

00:09:06.010 --> 00:09:07.380
I'm going to make money since
they're basically pretty

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:09.363
healthy, but they're
risk averse so they

00:09:09.363 --> 00:09:10.730
will buy the insurance.

00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:12.670
So imagine the facts
are the following.

00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:17.970
Imagine that for every for every
100 MIT graduates, over

00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:25.750
the next year, 90 of them will
spend nothing on medical care,

00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:31.140
and 10 of them will
spend $1,000.

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:33.030
But we don't know which ones,
there's uncertainty.

00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:35.860
So I'm left with this
90% chance of zero,

00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:37.680
10% chance of $1,000.

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:40.900
So everybody graduating, since
we're a pretty healthy crop,

00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:45.120
90% of you will spend nothing
but 10% of you will spend

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:47.450
$1,000, and you don't
know which.

00:09:52.770 --> 00:09:53.920
And you're going to start
an insurance.

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:55.820
You could say look, I'm going
to start an insurance.

00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:57.420
What I'm going to do is I'm
going to say is what's the

00:09:57.420 --> 00:10:01.210
expected payout that I'm going
to have as an insurer

00:10:01.210 --> 00:10:02.790
over the next year?

00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:07.440
Well, the expected payout over
the next year is $10,000

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:08.970
total, right?

00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:10.780
And let's say there's
100 students you are

00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:12.030
going to sell to.

00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:18.690
The expected payout the next
year is $10,000 total.

00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:20.770
10 students will cost you $1,000
nine students will cost

00:10:20.770 --> 00:10:21.640
you nothing.

00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:25.800
Expected payout next year is
$10,000, or per student you're

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:32.480
selling to the expected
payout is $100.

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:32.740
Right?

00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:33.350
Have I got that right?

00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:33.830
Yeah.

00:10:33.830 --> 00:10:37.810
$100 per student you're
selling to.

00:10:37.810 --> 00:10:44.750
So if you sell to 100 students
at $100 you will break even.

00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:47.490
You will collect $10,000
at an expectation

00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:50.520
you'll pay out $10,000.

00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:58.080
So if you roll in and offer
insurance for $100 and you

00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:02.220
sell to all these students
then you'll break even.

00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:03.630
Let's say you then said
fine, I'm going to

00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:07.620
offer it for $110.

00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:12.320
Well, as long as people are
somewhat risk averse, in our

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:16.690
standard model they'd still
like insurance for $110.

00:11:16.690 --> 00:11:19.160
They'd still be willing to pay
a little risk premium--

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:21.600
remember about risk premiums
to get health insurance.

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:25.515
So you still sell it, let's
say, and you make $1,000.

00:11:25.515 --> 00:11:27.500
Then you're going to sell to
100 students at 10 extra

00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:29.290
dollars to make $1,000 profit.

00:11:29.290 --> 00:11:30.860
So this is a pretty
good product.

00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:34.900
I'll make a $1,000
profit on this.

00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:39.390
Now, what's in fact the problem
with this analysis?

00:11:39.390 --> 00:11:42.340
The problem is that what
if some of the

00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:44.440
healthy guys say, look--

00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:47.860
what if people know whether
they're healthy or sick?

00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:49.120
What if it's not uncertain?

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:51.450
Or what if people have
a good inkling?

00:11:51.450 --> 00:11:56.750
What if, in fact, half of the 90
people who will spend zero,

00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:59.650
what if 50 of them actually
know they're

00:11:59.650 --> 00:12:00.690
going to spend zero?

00:12:00.690 --> 00:12:01.700
What if, in fact, the
story is different?

00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:04.400
It's not totally uncertain,
but 50 people know they're

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:04.810
going to spend zero.

00:12:04.810 --> 00:12:07.190
They're really healthy and they
don't like the doctor,

00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:09.210
they know they're going
to spend zero.

00:12:09.210 --> 00:12:12.550
Whereas the other 50, well, 40
of them might spend zero and

00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:14.210
10 might spend $1,000.

00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:16.445
Well in that case, the 50 that
knows they're going to spend

00:12:16.445 --> 00:12:18.410
zero won't buy the
health insurance.

00:12:18.410 --> 00:12:20.220
They'll be like why
should I buy it?

00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:22.235
I know I'm going to spend zero,
why should I pay $100 or

00:12:22.235 --> 00:12:26.230
$110 dollars for health
insurance?

00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:28.920
So then, how much
will you sell?

00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:33.010
And let's say you charge
$110 to make a profit.

00:12:33.010 --> 00:12:36.280
You'll sell to 40
guys, 40 healthy

00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:38.770
guys, and 10 sick guys.

00:12:38.770 --> 00:12:47.640
So 50 guys times $110, so
you'll make $5,500.

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:49.010
What will you pay out?

00:12:49.010 --> 00:12:56.260
You'll pay out $10,000 because
the 10 sick guys are

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.440
definitely buying, right?

00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:00.310
The 10 guys who'll end up
getting sick are definitely

00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:02.540
buying along with
40 healthy guys.

00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:05.710
So you will collect $5,500 but
you'll pay out $10,000.

00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:08.320
You'll lose money.

00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:09.710
Why will you lose money?

00:13:09.710 --> 00:13:15.930
You'll lose money because you'll
be collecting as if

00:13:15.930 --> 00:13:18.600
you're dealing with a full
probability distribution but

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:20.360
you're only going to see
a truncated probability

00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:21.540
distribution.

00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:23.830
You're only going to see the
distribution for the people

00:13:23.830 --> 00:13:25.170
who have some chance
of getting sick.

00:13:25.170 --> 00:13:27.110
The very healthy people
drop out.

00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:30.790
As a result you lose money.

00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:32.680
This is the insurer problem.

00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:36.300
If the healthiest people don't
buy insurance then they can't

00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:38.350
price it fairly.

00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:39.430
How would you overcome this?

00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:43.010
Well, you would have to raise
your price a lot, right?

00:13:43.010 --> 00:13:45.170
So let's say you say fine, I'm
going to overcome this.

00:13:45.170 --> 00:13:50.850
If I raise my price to
$200 or to $210 then

00:13:50.850 --> 00:13:52.410
I'd make money again.

00:13:52.410 --> 00:13:55.140
If I raise my price
$210 that's 50

00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:56.560
people buying at $210.

00:13:56.560 --> 00:14:00.740
Then I get $11,000 in premiums
and I don't have to spend

00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:04.730
$10,000, and I make
money again.

00:14:04.730 --> 00:14:06.690
What's the problem with
that solution?

00:14:06.690 --> 00:14:07.050
Yeah?

00:14:07.050 --> 00:14:08.916
AUDIENCE: People will
probably be dropping

00:14:08.916 --> 00:14:09.950
out because you just--

00:14:09.950 --> 00:14:11.650
PROFESSOR: Some of these 40 will
say, well, I was happy to

00:14:11.650 --> 00:14:13.670
pay $100 but I'm not
happy to pay $200.

00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:15.720
The chances are really low
I'm going to get sick.

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:16.750
So this goes down.

00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:18.430
So you collect less money
but you still pay

00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:19.590
out to the sick people.

00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:21.780
And you never win.

00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:22.470
You can never win.

00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:24.550
As you raise the price the
healthier and healthier people

00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:28.070
drop out until you just simply
can't make money.

00:14:28.070 --> 00:14:28.425
Yeah?

00:14:28.425 --> 00:14:31.425
AUDIENCE: Is there any situation
where if you have a

00:14:31.425 --> 00:14:34.360
large enough number of people
that you're supplying to you

00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:37.212
can set the price at a certain
level such that you're

00:14:37.212 --> 00:14:41.646
guaranteed that there are at
least going to be a large

00:14:41.646 --> 00:14:45.139
number of people left after
dropping out so that you won't

00:14:45.139 --> 00:14:47.070
lose money?

00:14:47.070 --> 00:14:48.610
PROFESSOR: Yes, and what's
that going to depend on?

00:14:48.610 --> 00:14:52.985
So one extreme example is what
I've described here, where as

00:14:52.985 --> 00:14:55.113
you raise the price more healthy
drop out and so you

00:14:55.113 --> 00:14:56.550
can never make money.

00:14:56.550 --> 00:15:00.060
Under what conditions will that
be a particular problem

00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:02.440
or not be a problem?

00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:04.920
Well there's two key factors.

00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:06.605
First of all, it's going
to be how imperfect

00:15:06.605 --> 00:15:08.450
the information is.

00:15:08.450 --> 00:15:11.880
For example, if people know for
sure whether they're going

00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:14.990
to be in the zero bucket or
the $1,000 bucket then by

00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:17.190
definition you can't
make money.

00:15:17.190 --> 00:15:19.960
If you know for sure, with 100%
certainty, then why would

00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:21.500
you ever buy insurance unless
you're going to be in the

00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:23.080
$1,000 bucket?

00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:26.100
And why would you ever pay
more than $1,000 for it?

00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:28.650
So there's no way to make money
if people know for sure.

00:15:28.650 --> 00:15:33.450
So the first thing is where
nobody has any idea at all.

00:15:33.450 --> 00:15:35.830
Then this is going to be less
of a problem because healthy

00:15:35.830 --> 00:15:38.210
people won't drop out because
nobody knows who's healthy.

00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:40.110
So the first issue is going to
be the asymmetry of your

00:15:40.110 --> 00:15:41.490
information.

00:15:41.490 --> 00:15:44.260
The second factors is
going to be what?

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:47.590
The level of risk aversion,
because if people are very

00:15:47.590 --> 00:15:50.980
risk averse then they may be
willing to pay a lot for

00:15:50.980 --> 00:15:54.660
insurance even if the odds are
low it's going to hurt them.

00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:57.310
So in this case, once again if
people know for sure, risk

00:15:57.310 --> 00:15:58.390
aversion doesn't matter.

00:15:58.390 --> 00:16:00.610
But if people don't know for
sure, if there's some

00:16:00.610 --> 00:16:03.520
uncertainty, then you may get
healthy people buying health

00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:06.960
insurance because they're
risk averse.

00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:08.820
They may buy it anyway, and
so then you may not

00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:10.220
have a market failure.

00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:13.010
So basically, the more asymmetry
of information there

00:16:13.010 --> 00:16:15.580
is the more likely you're
going to lose money?

00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:17.060
What happens if you're
going to lose money?

00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:18.955
You're not going to start your
insurance company and MIT

00:16:18.955 --> 00:16:20.800
students will end
up uninsured.

00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:22.640
That's a market failure.

00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:26.130
The market for insurance will
fail, the market for insurance

00:16:26.130 --> 00:16:29.840
will fail because you will
end up not being

00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:31.680
able to make money.

00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:35.290
You're not going to be able to
make money because only the

00:16:35.290 --> 00:16:38.710
sickest people will buy, and
you lose by definition.

00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:42.070
That's the problem that we have
with private insurance.

00:16:42.070 --> 00:16:44.800
If the healthiest people stay
out, then the insurer can't

00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:46.220
make money.

00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:48.210
The insurers need a distribution
of healthy and

00:16:48.210 --> 00:16:50.290
sick to make money, they
can't make money if the

00:16:50.290 --> 00:16:51.540
healthy stay out.

00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:58.430
So what can we do about this?

00:16:58.430 --> 00:16:59.110
What can we do about this?

00:16:59.110 --> 00:17:02.800
Well there's two classes of
solutions we can have. The

00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:04.854
first is we can subsidize.

00:17:09.369 --> 00:17:16.540
Imagine if we said, we MIT, will
roll in and provide the

00:17:16.540 --> 00:17:18.040
insurance for free
to everyone.

00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:23.099
And then we'll pay the insurer
what they want.

00:17:23.099 --> 00:17:26.245
So MIT will come in, they'll
absorb the cost of the insurer

00:17:26.245 --> 00:17:28.270
and give it to MIT students
for free.

00:17:28.270 --> 00:17:31.135
Well, in that case all the MIT
students would take it, it

00:17:31.135 --> 00:17:35.430
would be free, and the insurer
could charge $100 or $110

00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:37.390
based on the negotiation
with MIT.

00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:39.625
And the insurer will provide the
insurance because everyone

00:17:39.625 --> 00:17:40.310
would take it.

00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:42.420
And MIT would just
pay the cost.

00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:44.670
So the market failure would be
solved, but of course at a

00:17:44.670 --> 00:17:47.720
cost of MIT having to pay
$10,000 or $11,000, or

00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:49.930
whatever it's going to be.

00:17:49.930 --> 00:17:54.250
So the market failure would be
solved by subsidizing the

00:17:54.250 --> 00:17:55.610
healthy people to come in.

00:17:55.610 --> 00:17:57.830
So essentially, if you pay off
the best risks to come in the

00:17:57.830 --> 00:18:00.010
market you solve the market
failure because then the

00:18:00.010 --> 00:18:03.620
insurer knows they're getting a
good distribution of risks.

00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:06.270
What's the other thing
you can do?

00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:07.920
Well the other thing you can do
is the centerpiece of the

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:09.760
current health care reform bill,
which I'll talk about

00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:12.920
next time, which is you can
mandate that everyone buy

00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:14.570
health insurance.

00:18:14.570 --> 00:18:18.390
If there was a law that every
MIT student had to have health

00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:21.950
insurance when they graduate
then, once again, the insurer

00:18:21.950 --> 00:18:25.140
would know what the distribution
of risks are and

00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:27.780
they could sell insurance
at a fair price.

00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:28.832
They wouldn't have to worry if
the healthy drop out because

00:18:28.832 --> 00:18:30.082
the healthy couldn't,
it would be illegal.

00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:35.060
Now, these two solutions--

00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:37.540
so you can subsidize
or you can mandate.

00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:41.610
Now these solutions--

00:18:41.610 --> 00:18:42.303
Yeah?

00:18:42.303 --> 00:18:46.247
AUDIENCE: Weren't a lot of
health insurance companies

00:18:46.247 --> 00:18:50.191
also looking at medical
records of

00:18:50.191 --> 00:18:52.163
people before deciding--

00:18:52.163 --> 00:18:55.121
were they unequally pricing
health care based

00:18:55.121 --> 00:18:57.093
on someone's history?

00:18:57.093 --> 00:19:00.051
And I know that caused a lot
of controversy say over

00:19:00.051 --> 00:19:01.037
pre-existing conditions.

00:19:01.037 --> 00:19:02.023
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:19:02.023 --> 00:19:03.400
Let me talk about
that next time.

00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:06.450
What you're asking is isn't it
in fact possible asymmetric

00:19:06.450 --> 00:19:08.170
information could flip?

00:19:08.170 --> 00:19:10.210
Isn't it possible insurers could
now know so much about

00:19:10.210 --> 00:19:12.030
us from public records that they
could start to have more

00:19:12.030 --> 00:19:14.490
information about us than we
even have about ourselves?

00:19:14.490 --> 00:19:16.800
And then they could decide to
get rid of us because they

00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:18.930
know we're a bad risk even
if we don't know.

00:19:18.930 --> 00:19:22.930
So could we be soon living in a
world of reverse asymmetric

00:19:22.930 --> 00:19:23.850
information?

00:19:23.850 --> 00:19:26.020
And that's possible, and I'll
talk about that next time.

00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:28.035
But for now let's assume we live
in a world where you know

00:19:28.035 --> 00:19:30.450
more than the insurer.

00:19:30.450 --> 00:19:32.220
So you can subsidize the guys,
you can mandate it.

00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:34.030
Now each of these have
pros and cons.

00:19:34.030 --> 00:19:38.310
If you subsidize them then the
MIT students are happy.

00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:40.880
They get insurance for free,
but MIT is out $10,000.

00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:42.070
Or if it's the government,
the government's

00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:43.320
out a lot of money.

00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:44.800
How does the government
raise that money?

00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:48.040
It taxes people, and that
has efficiency costs.

00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:48.970
So one thing we could
do is make health

00:19:48.970 --> 00:19:49.880
insurance free for everyone.

00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:51.900
That's what Canada does.

00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:54.610
Health insurance is
free for everyone.

00:19:54.610 --> 00:19:57.930
And the problem is to do that in
the US would cost something

00:19:57.930 --> 00:20:03.820
like a couple of trillion
dollars.

00:20:03.820 --> 00:20:07.530
That's a lot of money
to raise in taxes.

00:20:07.530 --> 00:20:10.090
And that would cause
inefficiency from raising that

00:20:10.090 --> 00:20:11.220
money in taxes.

00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:12.660
On the other hand the
mandate doesn't cost

00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:14.460
the government anything.

00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:18.560
But it makes healthy people very
upset because suddenly

00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:21.900
you're an MIT student, you know
for sure you're not going

00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:24.320
to spend zero but the government
mandates you have

00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:26.370
to pay that $100 premium.

00:20:26.370 --> 00:20:28.120
Well now you're upset.

00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:30.160
So basically there's no good
answer here to solve this

00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:31.920
asymmetric information
problem.

00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:34.120
Either we have to spend a lot
of money and then people

00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:35.600
aren't upset but
taxpayers are.

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:36.950
Insurers aren't but
taxpayers are.

00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:38.690
Or we have to mandate people
to buy, in which case the

00:20:38.690 --> 00:20:41.270
healthy will be upset they're
being forced to buy something

00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:43.120
they don't want.

00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:45.200
And that's the difficult
position we face ourselves in

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:46.980
with social insurance
programs.

00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:50.520
But the bottom line is what
we have is this failure of

00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:53.310
private insurance markets due to
asymmetric information and

00:20:53.310 --> 00:20:56.560
the need for the government to
come in and take one or both

00:20:56.560 --> 00:21:00.460
of these routes to
fix the problem.

00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:03.750
If the government doesn't then
you don't get people getting

00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:05.020
insurance that they'd
like to have. You

00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:07.246
get a market failure.

00:21:07.246 --> 00:21:09.850
You get a market failure in
people not having insurance

00:21:09.850 --> 00:21:11.980
that they would value.

00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:15.360
And that's why we have
governments come in and

00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:18.620
provide social insurance.

00:21:18.620 --> 00:21:20.815
Now, as I said, the government
comes in and provide many

00:21:20.815 --> 00:21:22.320
types of social insurance
of many types.

00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:24.870
There's medical social
insurance, and here the

00:21:24.870 --> 00:21:27.240
government does that through the
form of what we call two

00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:33.500
programs, Medicare
and Medicaid.

00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:38.700
Medicare is universal, heavily
subsidized health insurance

00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:41.230
for the elderly.

00:21:41.230 --> 00:21:44.800
Medicaid is like a
welfare program.

00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:47.710
It's means tested, categorical,
free health

00:21:47.710 --> 00:21:49.010
insurance for the poor.

00:21:49.010 --> 00:21:52.780
So Medicare's for the elderly,
Medicaid's for the poor.

00:21:52.780 --> 00:21:55.540
In neither case is there a
mandate, in both cases the

00:21:55.540 --> 00:21:57.420
government, essentially,
is making it free.

00:21:57.420 --> 00:22:00.530
Essentially it's gone the
subsidy route, as a result at

00:22:00.530 --> 00:22:03.370
an enormous cost to
the US taxpayer.

00:22:03.370 --> 00:22:07.740
Medicare is now about a $500
billion a year program.

00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:11.170
Medicaid is approaching a $400
billion a year program.

00:22:11.170 --> 00:22:14.060
It's almost a trillion dollars
US taxpayers are paying to get

00:22:14.060 --> 00:22:15.510
people to buy health
insurance.

00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:18.510
So by solving it with this route
these are incredibly,

00:22:18.510 --> 00:22:20.610
especially Medicare is an
incredibly politically popular

00:22:20.610 --> 00:22:22.080
program because why not?

00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:23.380
People are getting
it for free.

00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:26.280
But the cost is an enormous
budgetary pressure on the US

00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:27.620
government.

00:22:27.620 --> 00:22:30.760
That's for health.

00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:34.910
We also have disability
insurance, DI.

00:22:34.910 --> 00:22:37.880
That's for people who have
a career-ending injury.

00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:40.095
If you fall off your motorcycle
and get paralyzed

00:22:40.095 --> 00:22:43.360
and can't work anymore you can
get disability insurance,

00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:45.400
which is money which compensates
you for being

00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:47.035
unable to work having a
career-ending injury.

00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:57.750
So this is another form
of social insurance.

00:22:57.750 --> 00:23:02.430
We have workers' compensation,
which is insurance that you

00:23:02.430 --> 00:23:08.140
have to insure yourself against
injuries on the job.

00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:10.260
So if you slip and fall on the
job and have to miss a couple

00:23:10.260 --> 00:23:12.690
weeks of work this covers
your medical costs

00:23:12.690 --> 00:23:13.940
and your lost wages.

00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:18.720
And we have unemployment
insurance, which as I

00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:21.810
mentioned, is insurance for
people who lose their jobs due

00:23:21.810 --> 00:23:23.170
to economic circumstances.

00:23:23.170 --> 00:23:25.320
Unemployment insurance is not
for people who get fired

00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:26.295
because they're crappy
workers.

00:23:26.295 --> 00:23:28.570
It's for people who lose their
job because they're laid off

00:23:28.570 --> 00:23:29.990
for economic circumstances.

00:23:29.990 --> 00:23:34.700
They get some replacement of
wages under that unemployment

00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:35.450
insurance programs.

00:23:35.450 --> 00:23:37.260
These are the kind of social
insurance programs that we

00:23:37.260 --> 00:23:39.660
have in the US.

00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:42.960
And the arguments for them is
basically more complicated

00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:44.690
version of the arguments
I just made over there.

00:23:44.690 --> 00:23:46.780
The argument for all these
programs is that private

00:23:46.780 --> 00:23:49.680
insurance markets for things
like unemployment or injury

00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:52.590
will not function well due to
asymmetric information so the

00:23:52.590 --> 00:23:56.890
government needs to come in and
provide that insurance.

00:23:56.890 --> 00:24:00.220
But at the same time all of
these insurance programs have

00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:06.320
a cost. Not just the cost of
raising the money but the cost

00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:14.000
of what we call moral hazard,
which is that when you insure

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:17.200
people against adverse risk you

00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:18.805
encourage adverse behavior.

00:24:21.910 --> 00:24:24.890
When you insure people against
adverse risk you encourage

00:24:24.890 --> 00:24:27.460
adverse behavior.

00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:30.410
And the problem here is another
form of asymmetric

00:24:30.410 --> 00:24:31.800
information.

00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:35.640
So one problem of asymmetric
information is since insurers

00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:37.790
don't know enough about you
they'll under insure you.

00:24:37.790 --> 00:24:39.540
So it's a market failure.

00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:42.500
This is a flip side market
failure, which is since

00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:45.790
insurers can't perfectly be sure
about what's wrong with

00:24:45.790 --> 00:24:50.510
you, you will be encouraged to
misrepresent your state in

00:24:50.510 --> 00:24:53.540
order to collect money.

00:24:53.540 --> 00:24:56.270
So a classic example
here is workers'

00:24:56.270 --> 00:24:58.950
compensation insurance.

00:24:58.950 --> 00:25:01.000
Workers' compensation insurance
is about a $50

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.866
billion a year program that
provides money to people who

00:25:03.866 --> 00:25:06.140
are injured on the job.

00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:10.850
The problem is injured on the
job is very hard to verify.

00:25:10.850 --> 00:25:13.770
Most of the injuries are
not losing an arm.

00:25:13.770 --> 00:25:16.090
Most of the injuries are
straining your back.

00:25:16.090 --> 00:25:18.350
As anyone with back problems
knows it's pretty darn hard to

00:25:18.350 --> 00:25:21.230
verify if your back's
hurt or not.

00:25:21.230 --> 00:25:23.940
My first job in my first summer
after MIT was I was a

00:25:23.940 --> 00:25:26.820
filing clerk at a
doctor's office.

00:25:26.820 --> 00:25:28.830
The doctor did workers' comp--
this is a real story.

00:25:28.830 --> 00:25:32.630
Doctors do workers' comp claims.
It was one doctor with

00:25:32.630 --> 00:25:35.820
a staff of five secretaries and
an enormous filing staff.

00:25:35.820 --> 00:25:38.540
And the reason was the doctor
saw a patient every three

00:25:38.540 --> 00:25:40.270
minutes all day.

00:25:40.270 --> 00:25:42.060
They'd come in, he'd say, yeah,
you're hurt, here's your

00:25:42.060 --> 00:25:45.310
chit for workers' comp,
off you go.

00:25:45.310 --> 00:25:47.880
All day.

00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:50.460
So basically, because it's
incredibly hard to verify,

00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:52.260
this doctor was just-- basically
his role was saying

00:25:52.260 --> 00:25:55.700
yes to people so they could
get out of work.

00:25:55.700 --> 00:25:58.850
This is the problem we
have with a system--

00:25:58.850 --> 00:26:03.400
this is another information
asymmetry, which is now you,

00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:06.470
the insured, know more about
what's wrong with you than the

00:26:06.470 --> 00:26:08.670
insurer does.

00:26:08.670 --> 00:26:10.760
But it's a different form of
information asymmetry.

00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:14.670
Now it's that you may actually
not be as injured as you claim

00:26:14.670 --> 00:26:15.720
or need insurance
as you claim.

00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:17.920
As a result you over claim
insurance, and that costs the

00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:20.710
insurance industry money.

00:26:20.710 --> 00:26:24.880
Now, moral hazard,
theoretically, is unambiguous.

00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:27.310
But obviously it's going to
vary across situations.

00:26:27.310 --> 00:26:29.440
There's not going to be a whole
lot of moral hazard in

00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:31.170
programs that insure you
against blindness.

00:26:35.570 --> 00:26:37.770
And in that case that's because
it's pretty easy to

00:26:37.770 --> 00:26:39.230
observe if someone's
really blind.

00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:41.530
There's not a whole lot of
information asymmetry.

00:26:41.530 --> 00:26:43.520
There's going to be a lot of
moral hazard in programs that

00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:47.230
insure you against having a bad
back because that's harder

00:26:47.230 --> 00:26:48.790
to observe.

00:26:48.790 --> 00:26:52.250
And in fact we have lots of
evidence that moral hazard's a

00:26:52.250 --> 00:26:55.640
big problem with social
insurance programs. So one

00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:58.560
type of evidence is sort
of fun stories.

00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:01.010
So there's stories about, for
example, the Massachusetts

00:27:01.010 --> 00:27:04.870
prison guard who got about
$25,000 in workers' comp

00:27:04.870 --> 00:27:07.890
claims because he claimed he
hurt his back at work until

00:27:07.890 --> 00:27:09.650
people went online in order to
see that the same guy was

00:27:09.650 --> 00:27:10.570
running a karate school.

00:27:10.570 --> 00:27:13.130
And there was videos of him
doing karate moves and stuff

00:27:13.130 --> 00:27:16.000
online running his
karate school.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:17.690
Or the other guy, who
unfortunately had good

00:27:17.690 --> 00:27:20.980
instincts, he was on workers'
comp because he was injured.

00:27:20.980 --> 00:27:23.250
But then there was footage of
him at 9/11 flying down and

00:27:23.250 --> 00:27:24.970
carrying buckets back and forth
and helping put out the

00:27:24.970 --> 00:27:27.110
fire, which was a nice thing
for him to do, but clearly

00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:28.940
illustrated that he was not
too injured to be able to

00:27:28.940 --> 00:27:30.500
carry out his job.

00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:33.880
So basically, there's lots of
observational evidence.

00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:38.870
But there's also very clear
statistical evidence, which is

00:27:38.870 --> 00:27:43.420
if moral hazard doesn't exist
then when the program gets

00:27:43.420 --> 00:27:46.420
more generous I shouldn't
be more injured, right?

00:27:46.420 --> 00:27:47.430
My injury should be
something that

00:27:47.430 --> 00:27:49.160
happens or doesn't happen.

00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:52.480
But if more generous programs
lead to more injuries, or

00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:55.580
people staying out of work
longer, or people using more

00:27:55.580 --> 00:28:00.120
health care then that suggests
moral hazard.

00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:02.460
The generosity, whether you're
sick or not, shouldn't be

00:28:02.460 --> 00:28:04.610
affected by the generosity
of health insurance.

00:28:04.610 --> 00:28:06.320
But if you suddenly see more
generous health insurance

00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:07.890
leads to more people
being sick that

00:28:07.890 --> 00:28:09.240
suggests moral hazard.

00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:12.510
And there's hundreds of studies
of this type showing,

00:28:12.510 --> 00:28:15.880
in all these realms, enormous
moral hazard.

00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:18.950
Showing, for example, for
workers' comp, that when you

00:28:18.950 --> 00:28:21.890
make workers' comp more generous
people report more

00:28:21.890 --> 00:28:24.570
injuries on the job.

00:28:24.570 --> 00:28:27.160
Here's my favorite
fact about that.

00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:31.980
Someone did a study of type of
injury reported to workers'

00:28:31.980 --> 00:28:35.170
comp by day of the week.

00:28:35.170 --> 00:28:39.570
And what they found was on
Mondays compared to other days

00:28:39.570 --> 00:28:42.730
of the week there was a very
high share of sprains and

00:28:42.730 --> 00:28:47.290
strains and a low share of
lacerations, of cuts.

00:28:47.290 --> 00:28:51.340
So every other day of the week,
say it was 50% cuts and

00:28:51.340 --> 00:28:52.570
50% strains.

00:28:52.570 --> 00:28:56.140
On Monday it was 75% strains
and 25% cuts.

00:28:56.140 --> 00:28:57.365
Why is that?

00:28:57.365 --> 00:28:59.590
Well, that's because guys got
hurt over the weekend playing

00:28:59.590 --> 00:29:02.390
softball and they came in on
Monday and they said they got

00:29:02.390 --> 00:29:03.000
hurt on the job.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:04.700
Now you can't do that if you cut
yourself on the weekend in

00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:07.630
your shop because it's scabbed
over by Monday.

00:29:07.630 --> 00:29:09.450
But if you hurt your back on
the weekend you can drag

00:29:09.450 --> 00:29:11.920
yourself over and say, ooh,
I hurt my back at work.

00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:13.610
So that's exactly the kind of
evidence that's consistent

00:29:13.610 --> 00:29:14.900
with moral hazard.

00:29:14.900 --> 00:29:16.500
And we see that everywhere.

00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:18.170
There's huge amounts
of moral hazard.

00:29:18.170 --> 00:29:20.230
Moral hazard, for example, in
health insurance the best

00:29:20.230 --> 00:29:23.920
estimates are that the amount
of extra money that we spend

00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:26.500
on society on health care
because of moral hazard on the

00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:29.580
order of $500 billion a year in
terms of extra care that's

00:29:29.580 --> 00:29:31.360
used because people
are insured.

00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:33.160
That does nothing to improve
their health, they just use it

00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:34.020
because they're insured.

00:29:34.020 --> 00:29:37.540
It's on the order of $500
billion a year.

00:29:37.540 --> 00:29:39.440
This is an enormous problem.

00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:42.700
So here we have what we call
the classic social

00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:44.760
insurance trade off.

00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:47.840
On the one hand, people
value insurance.

00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:52.880
Insurance is very valuable to
help you in the state when you

00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:58.270
get in an accident or are
injured in some way.

00:29:58.270 --> 00:30:01.360
On the other hand, giving people
insurance against those

00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:06.010
bad outcomes will encourage
bad behavior.

00:30:06.010 --> 00:30:10.070
And that bad behavior has
two forms of costs.

00:30:10.070 --> 00:30:13.080
There's two costs to
that bad behavior.

00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:18.700
The first cost is the tax costs
and the deadweight loss

00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:22.270
of taxation, which is if there's
$500 billion extra in

00:30:22.270 --> 00:30:27.040
medical care used because people
are insured then that

00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:31.170
means that's $500 billion of
taxes we have to raise, or

00:30:31.170 --> 00:30:33.193
$500 billion in resource
costs to society.

00:30:33.193 --> 00:30:34.230
Well, not all that's
government.

00:30:34.230 --> 00:30:36.420
But a couple hundred billion
in taxes we have to raise,

00:30:36.420 --> 00:30:38.610
that causes deadweight loss.

00:30:38.610 --> 00:30:42.070
The more important cost is
really the overall efficiency

00:30:42.070 --> 00:30:48.110
loss from people using resources
inefficiently, from

00:30:48.110 --> 00:30:51.430
people not behaving optimally
because of the incentives of

00:30:51.430 --> 00:30:54.270
social insurance.

00:30:54.270 --> 00:30:56.290
So let's go back and think about
the case of workers'

00:30:56.290 --> 00:31:00.780
comp, and let's think about
our standard leisure

00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:03.320
consumption trade off.

00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:07.090
We have our standard leisure
consumption trade off where

00:31:07.090 --> 00:31:10.370
you have leisure on this axis,
consumption on this axis, some

00:31:10.370 --> 00:31:12.773
budget constraint, and people
choose how much leisure to

00:31:12.773 --> 00:31:15.540
take and how much consumption
to take.

00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:21.460
Now the slope of this budget
constraint is minus your wage.

00:31:21.460 --> 00:31:24.110
That's the price of leisure.

00:31:24.110 --> 00:31:27.670
So the price of sitting at home
is the wage you could

00:31:27.670 --> 00:31:30.390
have earned out in the market.

00:31:30.390 --> 00:31:36.220
What this means is you will sit
at home until the value

00:31:36.220 --> 00:31:39.630
you get from sitting at home
falls below the value you get

00:31:39.630 --> 00:31:40.710
out in the market.

00:31:40.710 --> 00:31:43.220
So in other words, you wouldn't
work 24 hours a day

00:31:43.220 --> 00:31:46.680
because that 24th hour, the
sleep would be so valuable

00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:50.920
that it would clearly exceed
the wage you could earn.

00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:52.820
So when you decide how hard to
work, when an individual

00:31:52.820 --> 00:31:53.310
decides how--

00:31:53.310 --> 00:31:56.090
presuming we can freely
choose our hours--

00:31:56.090 --> 00:32:01.730
we decide how hard to work, we
basically trade off how much

00:32:01.730 --> 00:32:05.170
we value not working versus
how much we'd

00:32:05.170 --> 00:32:05.970
earn if we do work.

00:32:05.970 --> 00:32:08.670
If you're in a high wage you
might work more hours, if

00:32:08.670 --> 00:32:10.583
you're in a low wage you'll earn
less because if you're in

00:32:10.583 --> 00:32:14.320
a low wage you might as well sit
at home and watch Oprah.

00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:15.920
If you earn a high wage you're
not going to watch Oprah

00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:17.560
you're going to go
earn the money.

00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:19.410
And that's how we make our
labor supply decisions.

00:32:19.410 --> 00:32:25.340
We set the wage equal to the
marginal value of leisure.

00:32:25.340 --> 00:32:29.650
That's how we make our labor
decisions, is we say if the

00:32:29.650 --> 00:32:32.190
marginal value of the next hour
of leisure exceeds my

00:32:32.190 --> 00:32:35.400
wage I'll stay home.

00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:37.970
If the marginal value of the
next hour of leisure is below

00:32:37.970 --> 00:32:39.220
my wage I'll going to work.

00:32:41.530 --> 00:32:43.620
And that's how we make our
labor supply decisions.

00:32:43.620 --> 00:32:46.900
What does workers' comp do
to this, or UI or other

00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:48.310
programs like that?

00:32:48.310 --> 00:32:51.690
What that says is wait a second,
now if I sit at home I

00:32:51.690 --> 00:32:54.760
don't just get the marginal
value of my leisure, I also

00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:56.780
get a check from
the government.

00:32:56.780 --> 00:32:59.830
So now if I sit at home I get
the marginal value of my

00:32:59.830 --> 00:33:02.790
leisure plus a workers'
comp check.

00:33:02.790 --> 00:33:05.930
Whereas if I work I still
just get my wage.

00:33:05.930 --> 00:33:07.470
So what's that going to do to
the amount of hours I'm going

00:33:07.470 --> 00:33:10.110
to want to work?

00:33:10.110 --> 00:33:13.610
It's going to reduce them
because now it's makes sitting

00:33:13.610 --> 00:33:16.570
at home more attractive because
now I'm going to work

00:33:16.570 --> 00:33:19.370
only until my wage exceeds my
marginal value of leisure plus

00:33:19.370 --> 00:33:21.580
workers' comp.

00:33:21.580 --> 00:33:23.570
So if workers' comp is big
enough and my wage isn't that

00:33:23.570 --> 00:33:27.530
high, in the limit, if workers
comp replaced all my wages I

00:33:27.530 --> 00:33:29.180
would never work.

00:33:29.180 --> 00:33:38.710
If workers' comp had what we
call a 100% replacement rate,

00:33:38.710 --> 00:33:42.260
replacement rate, if it replaced
100% of my wages I

00:33:42.260 --> 00:33:43.040
would never work.

00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:43.430
Why?

00:33:43.430 --> 00:33:45.760
Because by definition this side
would always be less than

00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:50.300
this side, so I'd never work.

00:33:50.300 --> 00:33:52.620
And that's the efficiency loss
of these social insurance

00:33:52.620 --> 00:33:55.550
programs. That people are not
engaging in productive trades.

00:33:55.550 --> 00:33:57.930
Society just cares
about this part.

00:33:57.930 --> 00:34:00.700
Society just cares about your
wage versus your marginal

00:34:00.700 --> 00:34:01.190
value of leisure.

00:34:01.190 --> 00:34:03.790
So if you work less than that
because of this part then

00:34:03.790 --> 00:34:06.550
that's a distortion, that's an
efficiency cost to society.

00:34:06.550 --> 00:34:08.810
You are sitting at home when
you should be making a

00:34:08.810 --> 00:34:13.280
productive trade of your
labor for output goods.

00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:15.320
And that's the efficiency cost
of social insurance.

00:34:17.989 --> 00:34:19.739
So what do we do?

00:34:19.739 --> 00:34:22.420
We want social insurance, on the
one hand, because private

00:34:22.420 --> 00:34:25.070
insurance markets fail.

00:34:25.070 --> 00:34:27.380
We don't want social insurance,
on the other hand,

00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:29.440
because people are going
to sit at home.

00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:30.110
What do we do?

00:34:30.110 --> 00:34:32.800
Well the answer is
we compromise.

00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:36.489
We have social insurance but
don't make it that generous.

00:34:36.489 --> 00:34:38.980
So for example, the unemployment
insurance

00:34:38.980 --> 00:34:44.060
program, that's insurance that
is valuable because there's no

00:34:44.060 --> 00:34:45.840
way to get private insurance
against losing your job.

00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:47.420
I'd never want to sell
that product.

00:34:47.420 --> 00:34:49.380
We know who'd take
that, right?

00:34:49.380 --> 00:34:50.989
On the other hand, we know
there's moral hazard.

00:34:50.989 --> 00:34:53.610
We know that people sit at home
longer rather looking for

00:34:53.610 --> 00:34:55.830
a job because they
get UI checks.

00:34:55.830 --> 00:34:56.850
There's great evidence
of that.

00:34:56.850 --> 00:34:59.710
For example, if you look at how
long people sit at home,

00:34:59.710 --> 00:35:01.920
everyone sits at home and then
suddenly gets a job the week

00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:03.710
UI runs out.

00:35:03.710 --> 00:35:06.020
That's an exaggeration, but
roughly speaking, there's a

00:35:06.020 --> 00:35:07.680
huge amount of people
sitting at home

00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:09.090
collecting the UI checks.

00:35:09.090 --> 00:35:10.150
What do we do?

00:35:10.150 --> 00:35:13.660
Well the UI replacement
rate is around 50%.

00:35:13.660 --> 00:35:15.230
We say, look, we know you're
going to want to sit home so

00:35:15.230 --> 00:35:16.540
we're going to make your
life uncomfortable.

00:35:16.540 --> 00:35:20.310
We'll only give you half of what
you'd earn at work, but

00:35:20.310 --> 00:35:21.780
we don't want you to starve so
we'll give you half of what

00:35:21.780 --> 00:35:23.280
you earn at work.

00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:26.290
And so the replacement rate
is chosen to trade off the

00:35:26.290 --> 00:35:29.800
benefits of insuring people
against these bad events

00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:31.880
against the costs of distorting
their behavior

00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:33.010
through moral hazard.

00:35:33.010 --> 00:35:34.360
And that's the social
insurance trade off.

00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:37.150
That's how we set up these
social insurance programs.

00:35:37.150 --> 00:35:40.710
They sort of embody
that trade off.

00:35:40.710 --> 00:35:41.960
Questions about that?

00:35:44.090 --> 00:35:47.100
Now, so what I want to do in the
remaining time is I want

00:35:47.100 --> 00:35:49.830
to talk about the nation's
largest single social

00:35:49.830 --> 00:35:53.130
insurance program, one you've
heard about a lot, which is

00:35:53.130 --> 00:35:53.685
Social Security.

00:35:53.685 --> 00:35:55.840
We're going to talk about
Social Security.

00:35:55.840 --> 00:35:59.650
I'm going to come back next
lecture and we'll go over a

00:35:59.650 --> 00:36:01.850
bit what's going to be on
the final in the last 15

00:36:01.850 --> 00:36:02.520
minutes next time.

00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:04.550
But the first part of the
lecture I want to talk about

00:36:04.550 --> 00:36:07.030
health insurance, which is our
single largest government

00:36:07.030 --> 00:36:08.320
expenditure.

00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:10.980
But the single biggest
government program right now,

00:36:10.980 --> 00:36:13.890
social insurance program, it
remains Social Security.

00:36:13.890 --> 00:36:16.600
Medicare is going to pass it
in about two years, but for

00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:17.890
now it's still Social
Security.

00:36:20.750 --> 00:36:22.025
What is Social Security?

00:36:22.025 --> 00:36:27.430
Social Security is insurance
against the income loss from

00:36:27.430 --> 00:36:30.220
retirement.

00:36:30.220 --> 00:36:33.930
We know that when you have to
retire you're going to suffer

00:36:33.930 --> 00:36:36.180
a big income loss.

00:36:36.180 --> 00:36:39.000
What the government does is
insures you against that

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:42.270
income loss by providing
you Social Security.

00:36:42.270 --> 00:36:44.170
And here's how it works.

00:36:44.170 --> 00:36:46.870
How many of you have seen a pay
stub and you've seen the

00:36:46.870 --> 00:36:48.950
word FICA on it, and then
there's a charge that's coming

00:36:48.950 --> 00:36:50.320
out of your pay?

00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:53.180
FICA is the Federal Insurance
Contribution Amount.

00:36:53.180 --> 00:36:56.610
That's the money you're paying
in to support the social

00:36:56.610 --> 00:36:59.210
insurance program.

00:36:59.210 --> 00:37:02.210
You pay that in, and that's
currently 12.4% of wages, well

00:37:02.210 --> 00:37:05.325
6.2% on you and 6.2%
on your employer.

00:37:05.325 --> 00:37:08.950
You each pay 6.2%
of your wages.

00:37:08.950 --> 00:37:12.820
That goes into a trust fund and
that money then gets paid

00:37:12.820 --> 00:37:15.000
out to retirees, and hopefully
paid out to

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:16.250
you when you retire.

00:37:18.130 --> 00:37:22.160
So the way Social Security works
is you pay in money when

00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:25.470
you're young, that money
gets paid out to

00:37:25.470 --> 00:37:28.470
you when you retire.

00:37:28.470 --> 00:37:30.550
Not that same money because
your money going in now is

00:37:30.550 --> 00:37:31.820
going to today's retirees.

00:37:31.820 --> 00:37:34.820
Future workers will pay in and
that money will go to you.

00:37:34.820 --> 00:37:35.970
And the Social Security
replacement

00:37:35.970 --> 00:37:38.630
rate is around 50%.

00:37:38.630 --> 00:37:40.280
So to try to deal with this
problem the Social Security

00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:46.880
replacement rate's around 50%.

00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:48.320
So what's the benefit
of Social Security?

00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:50.730
Well, clearly the benefit is
people don't want to starve

00:37:50.730 --> 00:37:52.130
when they retire.

00:37:52.130 --> 00:37:53.610
We'd like insurance
against the income

00:37:53.610 --> 00:37:56.200
loss of when we retire.

00:37:56.200 --> 00:37:58.940
Now, our own savings can do that
to some extent but it's

00:37:58.940 --> 00:38:01.160
not perfect because you don't
know exactly how much to save,

00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:02.340
you don't know when you retire,
you don't know how

00:38:02.340 --> 00:38:03.580
long you'll live.

00:38:03.580 --> 00:38:04.800
So the government
social insurance

00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:06.500
program helps with that.

00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:10.320
But there's also a moral hazard
cost, which is if you

00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:13.180
insure people against retirement
you encourage

00:38:13.180 --> 00:38:17.970
retirement, because now we're
saying is if you work you get

00:38:17.970 --> 00:38:21.530
your wage but if you retire you
get your Social Security.

00:38:21.530 --> 00:38:26.750
So now, you're eligible for
Social Security at age 62.

00:38:26.750 --> 00:38:30.310
So at age 62 you're suddenly
eligible for about half your

00:38:30.310 --> 00:38:31.980
wage in Social Security.

00:38:31.980 --> 00:38:35.250
So now your decision
is, gee, do I work?

00:38:35.250 --> 00:38:37.250
Well that's contrasted against
my marginal value of leisure

00:38:37.250 --> 00:38:39.690
plus half my wage.

00:38:39.690 --> 00:38:41.730
So unless the marginal value of
leisure is less than half

00:38:41.730 --> 00:38:45.040
my wage I'm going to quit.

00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:49.230
So what Social Security is
doing is distorting your

00:38:49.230 --> 00:38:51.450
decision and causing you
to retire early.

00:38:51.450 --> 00:38:54.950
That's the moral hazard part.

00:38:54.950 --> 00:38:58.500
Now in the US we recognize
this, and we do

00:38:58.500 --> 00:39:00.342
sort of a neat trick.

00:39:00.342 --> 00:39:04.640
What we do in US is we have
something called an actuarial

00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:10.210
adjustment to your Social
Security benefits.

00:39:10.210 --> 00:39:12.930
What that means is the
following, you're 62 and you

00:39:12.930 --> 00:39:17.160
say, wait a second, I can retire
now, and if I retire

00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:19.920
now I'm going to get
half my wage.

00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:20.920
So why not retire now?

00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:22.910
We say, wait a second, we've
got a deal for you.

00:39:22.910 --> 00:39:27.130
If you work one more year and
retire next year then we'll

00:39:27.130 --> 00:39:30.170
give you 7% more every year
for the rest of your life.

00:39:30.170 --> 00:39:33.040
Your check will be 7% higher
for the rest your life.

00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:35.473
If you work two more years it
will be 14% higher, 3 more

00:39:35.473 --> 00:39:38.180
years 21% higher, et cetera.

00:39:38.180 --> 00:39:41.290
We recognize the moral hazard,
and we raise the check the

00:39:41.290 --> 00:39:45.260
longer you work to
make up for it.

00:39:45.260 --> 00:39:47.960
So the US recognizes that, and
as a result there's not a huge

00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:50.310
moral hazard from Social
Security in the US.

00:39:50.310 --> 00:39:57.590
It's pretty modest. In Europe
this is not the case.

00:39:57.590 --> 00:39:58.800
Let's take the country--

00:39:58.800 --> 00:39:59.800
let me back up.

00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:01.980
So what the actuarial adjustment
does is says we

00:40:01.980 --> 00:40:03.220
recognize that Social
Security is

00:40:03.220 --> 00:40:05.310
essentially taxing your work.

00:40:05.310 --> 00:40:08.250
To offset that we're going to
subsidize you to work more by

00:40:08.250 --> 00:40:12.520
raising your Social Security
check the more you work.

00:40:12.520 --> 00:40:15.940
In Europe they're not
as smart as us.

00:40:15.940 --> 00:40:18.170
They don't recognize this, or
if they do they're not smart

00:40:18.170 --> 00:40:20.120
enough to reflect it.

00:40:20.120 --> 00:40:21.480
They don't have an actuarial
adjustment.

00:40:21.480 --> 00:40:23.200
So here's how the Social
Security system works in the

00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:24.690
Netherlands, for example.

00:40:24.690 --> 00:40:28.550
When you reach 55 in the
Netherlands your choice is you

00:40:28.550 --> 00:40:31.660
can work or you can stop working
and get a Social

00:40:31.660 --> 00:40:35.480
Security check which is
90% of your wage.

00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:38.210
So literally, your choice is
work or sit at home and get

00:40:38.210 --> 00:40:41.960
90% of your wage with no
actuarial adjustment.

00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:44.530
So unless the value of your
leisure is less than 10% of

00:40:44.530 --> 00:40:46.640
your wage you can just
sit at home.

00:40:46.640 --> 00:40:49.370
But wait, that's not all.

00:40:49.370 --> 00:40:51.510
This is a very generous
program, right?

00:40:51.510 --> 00:40:52.880
How do they pay for that?

00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:55.500
They pay for it by
taxing workers.

00:40:55.500 --> 00:40:59.290
So if you work you get your wage
but then you pay a 40%

00:40:59.290 --> 00:41:01.280
payroll tax.

00:41:01.280 --> 00:41:05.320
So actually, you can work and
get 60% of your wage or sit at

00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:07.970
home and get 90% of your wage.

00:41:07.970 --> 00:41:08.640
Guess what?

00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:13.140
No one works after age 55
in the Netherlands.

00:41:13.140 --> 00:41:15.660
Literally.

00:41:15.660 --> 00:41:17.060
Now people will do
some underground

00:41:17.060 --> 00:41:17.970
work that's not taxed.

00:41:17.970 --> 00:41:20.360
They'll paint houses or things
which they can do on the

00:41:20.360 --> 00:41:21.390
underground economy.

00:41:21.390 --> 00:41:25.030
But literally, nobody works
after 55 in the Netherlands.

00:41:25.030 --> 00:41:26.035
Economics works.

00:41:26.035 --> 00:41:30.880
When you make the incentives
that blatant economics works.

00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:32.120
And that's the moral hazard.

00:41:32.120 --> 00:41:35.830
That's an example of not
respecting the social

00:41:35.830 --> 00:41:39.220
insurance trade off, erring on
the side of insuring people

00:41:39.220 --> 00:41:42.340
over respecting the problems
of moral hazard.

00:41:42.340 --> 00:41:45.720
And the answer is part of the
major problem that they have

00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:49.120
in these countries, part of the
major deficit, prolonged

00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:52.730
deficit problem they face is
that older people don't work.

00:41:52.730 --> 00:41:56.530
Now these countries have started
to recognize this, and

00:41:56.530 --> 00:41:57.580
they're starting to try
to deal with this.

00:41:57.580 --> 00:41:59.950
In fact, the country of France,
you may have noticed,

00:41:59.950 --> 00:42:01.530
recently tried to
deal with this.

00:42:01.530 --> 00:42:04.520
They have proposed raising their
retirement age, which is

00:42:04.520 --> 00:42:07.170
age 60, beyond which,
essentially, no one works in

00:42:07.170 --> 00:42:11.180
France, to age 62.

00:42:11.180 --> 00:42:11.710
What happened?

00:42:11.710 --> 00:42:15.470
You may have heard, massive
strikes, enormous political

00:42:15.470 --> 00:42:19.160
strife because people don't
understand economics.

00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:22.912
People don't understand that,
gee, yes that'll be a bummer

00:42:22.912 --> 00:42:25.160
if you work a couple years
longer, but that's what's

00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:26.930
going to make our
economy fiscally

00:42:26.930 --> 00:42:28.720
sound and more efficient.

00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:31.550
And in the long run we all
benefit from that.

00:42:31.550 --> 00:42:33.410
So the government's, by the
way, not proposing that

00:42:33.410 --> 00:42:36.300
today's retirees are hurt,
saying starting in 20 years

00:42:36.300 --> 00:42:37.815
you have to work two
years longer.

00:42:37.815 --> 00:42:41.100
So overall everyone's going to
benefit, but the bottom line

00:42:41.100 --> 00:42:42.570
is people are too short-sighted
to understand

00:42:42.570 --> 00:42:45.130
the economics, and that leads
to the rioting and things we

00:42:45.130 --> 00:42:47.310
saw in France.

00:42:47.310 --> 00:42:50.240
This stuff is hard to
a normal person.

00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:53.405
You guys are smart and you spent
a semester learning it.

00:42:53.405 --> 00:42:55.360
If you take a regular person in
the street they just don't

00:42:55.360 --> 00:42:58.890
understand this trade off,
and that's the problem.

00:42:58.890 --> 00:43:00.980
That's the problem in trying
to deal with these moral

00:43:00.980 --> 00:43:05.120
hazard issues by making social
insurance less generous.

00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:07.420
Now, let me talk about one
other issue with Social

00:43:07.420 --> 00:43:09.310
Security because it's been in
the news and will be in the

00:43:09.310 --> 00:43:12.760
news, which is the fact that
Social Security is

00:43:12.760 --> 00:43:14.870
running out of money.

00:43:14.870 --> 00:43:17.730
Now, Social Security is running
out of money because

00:43:17.730 --> 00:43:19.090
here's a dirty secret
about Social

00:43:19.090 --> 00:43:20.840
Security you may not know.

00:43:20.840 --> 00:43:23.550
How many of you have ever
heard of a Ponzi scheme?

00:43:23.550 --> 00:43:24.515
Anyone watch Boardwalk Empire?

00:43:24.515 --> 00:43:26.810
They're doing that now,
Boardwalk Empire.

00:43:26.810 --> 00:43:29.240
A Ponzi scheme was named after
Charles Ponzi, a Boston

00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:32.770
investor, and here's how the
Ponzi scheme worked.

00:43:32.770 --> 00:43:33.560
I teach two classes.

00:43:33.560 --> 00:43:37.460
I teach now and I teach
again at 2:30.

00:43:37.460 --> 00:43:39.730
I teach 14.01 now,
14.41 at 2:30.

00:43:39.730 --> 00:43:42.810
Let's say I walked in here this
morning and I said, tell

00:43:42.810 --> 00:43:47.390
you what guys, you each give
me $1 and on Wednesday I'll

00:43:47.390 --> 00:43:49.390
give you $2.

00:43:49.390 --> 00:43:51.450
Now you're thinking, well,
that's bullshit, but you know

00:43:51.450 --> 00:43:52.765
what, I want a good grade so
I'll give him the dollar.

00:43:52.765 --> 00:43:54.790
So you give me the dollar.

00:43:54.790 --> 00:43:58.850
I then go to my 2:30 1441 class
and say, hey guys, you

00:43:58.850 --> 00:44:06.040
each give me $3 and on Wednesday
I'll give you $5.

00:44:06.040 --> 00:44:08.210
They are like same thing,
whatever, but they're higher

00:44:08.210 --> 00:44:09.390
classmen than you, they
have more money,

00:44:09.390 --> 00:44:11.340
they give me the money.

00:44:11.340 --> 00:44:14.560
I take their $3, I pocket $1.

00:44:14.560 --> 00:44:17.210
I come back on Wednesday
and give you each $2.

00:44:17.210 --> 00:44:18.730
You're like, holy shit,
that worked.

00:44:18.730 --> 00:44:20.710
I'm like, I've got a better
deal for you.

00:44:20.710 --> 00:44:24.610
You guys give me $6 and next
time I see you in class--

00:44:24.610 --> 00:44:26.160
semester's ending, but
you get the point--

00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:27.900
I'll give you $10.

00:44:27.900 --> 00:44:29.790
You're like, great, this guy's
trustworthy, we'll do that.

00:44:29.790 --> 00:44:30.880
You give me the $6.

00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:31.650
I pocket $1,

00:44:31.650 --> 00:44:35.080
I go back to my 14.41 and say
here's the $5 I owe you.

00:44:35.080 --> 00:44:36.020
They say, wow, that's great.

00:44:36.020 --> 00:44:37.410
I say, so I've got a better
deal for you.

00:44:37.410 --> 00:44:40.080
You give me $11, and
so on and so on.

00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:43.230
And as long as you're both
willing to play I can continue

00:44:43.230 --> 00:44:44.490
to pocket the money
and make money.

00:44:44.490 --> 00:44:46.470
This is also called the
pyramid scheme.

00:44:46.470 --> 00:44:49.440
You might have heard a guy
named Bernie Madoff.

00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:52.850
Never invest your money with a
guy who's last name is Madoff.

00:44:52.850 --> 00:44:57.230
Bernie Madoff, for 20 years ran
this kind of Ponzi scheme.

00:44:57.230 --> 00:45:00.710
What he'd do is he'd find
investors, he'd take money

00:45:00.710 --> 00:45:03.400
from them and promise them a
return, he'd then find more

00:45:03.400 --> 00:45:05.410
investors, take the money from
the new investors and pay off

00:45:05.410 --> 00:45:07.860
the old investors,
and keep going.

00:45:07.860 --> 00:45:09.570
There was nothing real behind
what he was doing.

00:45:09.570 --> 00:45:12.480
He made it work for 20 years
until someone didn't want to

00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:13.770
play anymore.

00:45:13.770 --> 00:45:15.945
What if we did this, and it
was the last class and you

00:45:15.945 --> 00:45:17.080
guys said, well, see you
Professor Gruber.

00:45:17.080 --> 00:45:18.910
I'm like, wait a second, if you
give me $20, and you're

00:45:18.910 --> 00:45:20.430
out the door.

00:45:20.430 --> 00:45:22.110
Now I got to go to my next class
and I don't have any

00:45:22.110 --> 00:45:24.080
money for them.

00:45:24.080 --> 00:45:27.150
Then the whole thing collapses
And it collapses because a

00:45:27.150 --> 00:45:30.200
Ponzi scheme is not
a real investment.

00:45:30.200 --> 00:45:33.060
The asset behind a Ponzi scheme
is not a bank account.

00:45:33.060 --> 00:45:36.920
The asset behind a Ponzi
scheme is trust. And

00:45:36.920 --> 00:45:38.840
basically, as long as someone's
no longer trusting

00:45:38.840 --> 00:45:43.300
or can no longer pay
in, it goes away.

00:45:43.300 --> 00:45:45.260
Now, here's a little secret.

00:45:45.260 --> 00:45:48.070
Our Social Security system
is a Ponzi scheme.

00:45:48.070 --> 00:45:49.255
The nation's largest
social insurance

00:45:49.255 --> 00:45:50.420
program is a Ponzi scheme.

00:45:50.420 --> 00:45:51.560
How is that so?

00:45:51.560 --> 00:45:54.400
Well because you guys are
paying in now, and those

00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:56.080
checks are going to
today's elders.

00:45:56.080 --> 00:45:59.540
There's no guarantee that 40
years from now kids will pay

00:45:59.540 --> 00:46:00.910
in to support you.

00:46:00.910 --> 00:46:01.900
No guarantee at all.

00:46:01.900 --> 00:46:04.800
You can pay in your whole life,
and then people could

00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:06.310
vote out Social Security
when you're

00:46:06.310 --> 00:46:09.350
retired and you're screwed.

00:46:09.350 --> 00:46:10.160
It's a Ponzi scheme.

00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:14.760
There's nothing behind this
except trust in the

00:46:14.760 --> 00:46:16.450
government's programs.

00:46:16.450 --> 00:46:18.630
The only asset behind this is
the trust the government would

00:46:18.630 --> 00:46:21.050
never screw the voter,
the elderly voters,

00:46:21.050 --> 00:46:22.830
by ending the program.

00:46:22.830 --> 00:46:24.950
As long as the government is
willing to force young people

00:46:24.950 --> 00:46:27.050
to pay checks to support
older people the

00:46:27.050 --> 00:46:28.580
program can never end.

00:46:28.580 --> 00:46:31.045
But if the government ever is
unwilling to do that then a

00:46:31.045 --> 00:46:33.540
whole generation is going to
suffer from the Ponzi scheme.

00:46:33.540 --> 00:46:36.260
Now that's pretty unlikely
because elderly voters are

00:46:36.260 --> 00:46:37.200
pretty powerful.

00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:39.370
It seems unlikely that Ponzi
scheme will ever collapse.

00:46:39.370 --> 00:46:41.170
That's why we don't think of
it in those terms. But it

00:46:41.170 --> 00:46:42.120
really is just that.

00:46:42.120 --> 00:46:44.510
It's just a Ponzi scheme, in
this case supported by trust

00:46:44.510 --> 00:46:45.930
in the government.

00:46:45.930 --> 00:46:50.620
The problem is this Ponzi scheme
works well so long as

00:46:50.620 --> 00:46:53.620
more people are paying in than
are collecting money.

00:46:53.620 --> 00:46:59.940
So right now we have, in the US,
we have about 10 workers

00:46:59.940 --> 00:47:02.560
for every elderly person, or
about eight workers for every

00:47:02.560 --> 00:47:04.080
elderly person.

00:47:04.080 --> 00:47:06.770
So we can collect a lot of money
to pay off the elderly.

00:47:06.770 --> 00:47:09.520
The problem is that number's
diminishing rapidly because of

00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:10.660
the aging of the baby boomers.

00:47:10.660 --> 00:47:13.590
There's a huge bulge of
individuals who are about to

00:47:13.590 --> 00:47:15.530
become elderly and collect
their Social Security.

00:47:18.730 --> 00:47:24.090
By the year 2025 that 8:1 will
ratio be more like 4:1, and

00:47:24.090 --> 00:47:25.130
we're suddenly going to
be short on money.

00:47:25.130 --> 00:47:27.950
Here's the way I think about
it most scarily.

00:47:27.950 --> 00:47:30.530
How many of you guys have
grandparents in Florida?

00:47:30.530 --> 00:47:32.740
OK, you've got a few
grandparents in Florida.

00:47:32.740 --> 00:47:37.020
The US in 2025, the US as a
whole, will be older than

00:47:37.020 --> 00:47:37.950
Florida is today.

00:47:37.950 --> 00:47:39.760
Because if you think of Florida
as full of old people,

00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:42.990
that's the US in 20 years,
in 15 years.

00:47:42.990 --> 00:47:45.690
We're moving to a very aging
society, and that's going to

00:47:45.690 --> 00:47:47.880
put enormous pressure on
this Ponzi scheme.

00:47:47.880 --> 00:47:50.600
And that's why, in about 30
years or in about 25 years,

00:47:50.600 --> 00:47:53.500
Social Security goes bankrupt.

00:47:53.500 --> 00:47:57.410
We actually run out of money
unless we fix the program.

00:47:57.410 --> 00:47:59.740
So currently we have a situation
where we are

00:47:59.740 --> 00:48:01.530
projected for that program to go
bankrupt-- it's actually in

00:48:01.530 --> 00:48:02.660
about 30 years--

00:48:02.660 --> 00:48:05.180
the program to go bankrupt
because we have to pay out so

00:48:05.180 --> 00:48:07.910
much to this large
group of elderly.

00:48:07.910 --> 00:48:09.390
And that's a problem the
government needs to deal with.

00:48:09.390 --> 00:48:12.280
And it's going to have to deal
with it in one of two ways.

00:48:12.280 --> 00:48:15.340
It's going to either have
to raise taxes.

00:48:15.340 --> 00:48:17.810
We currently pay about
12.4% in payroll.

00:48:17.810 --> 00:48:20.080
To solve this problem forever
that tax rate would have to go

00:48:20.080 --> 00:48:22.530
up by about three and
a half to 4%.

00:48:22.530 --> 00:48:24.320
So we'd have to pay the three
and a half to 4% more of our

00:48:24.320 --> 00:48:26.570
wages to solve this problem.

00:48:26.570 --> 00:48:29.490
Or we're going to have to cut
benefits, do things like

00:48:29.490 --> 00:48:31.460
saying to people they can't get
their benefits at 62, that

00:48:31.460 --> 00:48:33.220
goes up to 64.

00:48:33.220 --> 00:48:35.180
And you can see US style rioting
rather than French

00:48:35.180 --> 00:48:37.630
style rioting.

00:48:37.630 --> 00:48:39.800
That's the difficult problem
the government faces going

00:48:39.800 --> 00:48:42.170
forward is that something
has to give.

00:48:42.170 --> 00:48:45.490
We either have to raise taxes to
support this program or we

00:48:45.490 --> 00:48:47.910
have to cut the benefits that
elderly people get.

00:48:47.910 --> 00:48:49.260
Yeah?

00:48:49.260 --> 00:48:52.427
AUDIENCE: This might just
postpone the problem, but

00:48:52.427 --> 00:48:54.784
would it be possible for
the government to

00:48:54.784 --> 00:48:56.748
taper off the benefits?

00:48:56.748 --> 00:49:00.760
So for instance, at 62, when
you're eligible, you could get

00:49:00.760 --> 00:49:03.773
let's say 50% of what you'd
normally would be getting, and

00:49:03.773 --> 00:49:06.570
that amount would slowly
increase as you get older.

00:49:06.570 --> 00:49:09.850
So when you're making your
labor decisions you would

00:49:09.850 --> 00:49:13.562
work, but maybe only half or
quarter time what you normally

00:49:13.562 --> 00:49:14.954
would work and that might--

00:49:14.954 --> 00:49:17.420
PROFESSOR: Certainly there are
compromises along the way but

00:49:17.420 --> 00:49:19.130
that still goes in the category
of benefit cuts.

00:49:19.130 --> 00:49:20.220
You're just talking about
a different way to

00:49:20.220 --> 00:49:21.040
do a benefits cut.

00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:23.390
There's lots of very subtle
and interesting ways--

00:49:23.390 --> 00:49:25.280
and believe me, when the time
comes I'm not just going to

00:49:25.280 --> 00:49:27.190
say we're cutting everybody's
benefit 10%.

00:49:27.190 --> 00:49:28.920
It will be something much more
subtle along the lines you're

00:49:28.920 --> 00:49:31.050
describing, sufficiently
complicated that people don't

00:49:31.050 --> 00:49:34.400
understand it so that they can
try and slip it by people.

00:49:34.400 --> 00:49:35.510
If they're going to cut benefits
it's going to be that

00:49:35.510 --> 00:49:38.640
complicated, and that's the
trade off we're going to face.

00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:38.950
All right.

00:49:38.950 --> 00:49:39.190
OK.

00:49:39.190 --> 00:49:43.090
So next class we'll talk about
health insurance and we'll do

00:49:43.090 --> 00:49:44.340
a final session.

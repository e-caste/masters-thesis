JONATHAN GRUBER: So
today, we're going

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:16.200
to talk about social insurance.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:20.990
So why do we have this thing
called "social insurance?"

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:24.740
Let's first talk about what
social insurance is, and then

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.650
ask why we have it.

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:31.040
So basically,
social insurance is

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.700
government-provided
insurance programs.

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.950
This is the largest
single category

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:39.680
of government expenditure
in the US today,

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.770
is government-provided
insurance programs.

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:44.142
Now, why do we have these?

00:00:44.142 --> 00:00:46.100
You might say, well, we
know why we have these.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.870
We learned about uncertainty.

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.310
We already talked about how
people dislike uncertainty,

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:52.970
and about how as a
result, insurance

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.070
is big business in America.

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.640
Private insurance
for health, for auto,

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.650
for life, for
property and casualty

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:03.380
adds up to about $1.5
trillion every year.

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.090
So we already have big
business of private insurance.

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.220
So why does the government
need to get involved?

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.280
I mean, after all,
people want insurance

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:14.730
if they're risk averse.

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:17.450
We talked about insurance
markets can work.

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.970
And as always in economics,
the question is, what's

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.260
wrong with the private market?

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.605
What is the market failure
that might generate interest

00:01:25.605 --> 00:01:28.280
in government being involved?

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.218
And the market failure in
the context of insurance

00:01:32.218 --> 00:01:33.760
is a different kind
of market failure

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:34.520
than we've talked about.

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:35.937
We've talked about
market failures

00:01:35.937 --> 00:01:39.050
like imperfect competition
as a market failure.

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.473
We talked about externalities
as a market failure.

00:01:41.473 --> 00:01:43.890
The new kind of market failure
we want to talk about today

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.690
is what we call
"information asymmetry."

00:01:53.750 --> 00:02:00.770
Information asymmetry,
basically which

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.980
is the difference
in the information

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:09.479
available to sellers and to
buyers in a given market.

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.150
So far in this course, we sort
of assumed full information.

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.220
We've assumed everybody
knows everything.

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.340
We weaken that assumption a
little bit with uncertainty,

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.530
and say that people don't
know whether they're

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.322
going to be sick or
healthy, but they still

00:02:22.322 --> 00:02:23.740
knew the probabilities.

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:26.025
Now we weaken it further
by saying not only is

00:02:26.025 --> 00:02:28.600
the information imperfect,
but different parties

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.700
in a transaction might
have different levels

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.960
of information.

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:37.390
And that's going to turn
out to cause market failure.

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.123
That information asymmetry
will cause market failure.

00:02:41.123 --> 00:02:42.790
Now, the math here
is quite hard, harder

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.450
than we do in this class.

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.710
So we'll just sort of do
this by an example or two.

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:50.500
And the best example
to start with

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.790
is the so-called
"lemons problem"

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.760
that was laid out by the Nobel
Prize-winning economist George

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.590
Akerlof in 1970, Nobel
Prize-winning economist

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.560
and husband of former Fed
Chairman Janet Yellen--

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.150
quite a power couple.

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.660
And here's what Akerlof
laid out-- he said,

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.330
let's look at the
market for used cars.

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.710
This is the market for
used cars as of 1970.

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:17.380
There's no CarFax.

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:19.120
There was none of
this information.

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.340
In 1970, when you went
to buy a used car,

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:21.965
you sort of went,
and kicked the tires,

00:03:21.965 --> 00:03:24.580
and decided if you're
going to buy it.

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:29.170
So this is a classic case
of an information asymmetry,

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:33.760
in that someone selling a car
knows what's wrong with it,

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.530
whereas the person
buying the car doesn't.

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:40.300
I'll go sort of kick the
tires and hope for the best.

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:47.030
So basically, in
particular, sellers of cars

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.250
might be selling them
because they're not good.

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:51.230
After all, why sell a car?

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.375
Maybe because it's
what's called a "lemon."

00:03:53.375 --> 00:03:57.080
A lemon is something which is
a poorly performing product,

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:01.280
in this case a car that's
got something wrong with it.

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.470
So when you go to buy
a car, you're worried.

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:05.840
You want to buy a car
in the used car market,

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:06.860
but you're worried.

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:08.390
Why is someone selling this car?

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:10.000
You should be.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.440
Why is someone selling this car?

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.420
If it's really in good shape,
why would they be selling it?

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:17.300
Therefore, as a
result, Akerlof argued,

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:19.970
there might be a collapse of
the entire used car market.

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:21.470
There might not be
transactions that

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:24.440
happen that can make
both parties better off.

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:29.210
Remember, a market failure is
whenever the private market

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:31.600
fails to maximize welfare.

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.930
What that means is
a market failure

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:37.150
arises whatever the
private market does not

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:41.530
deliver all transactions that
make buyer and seller better

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:44.020
off.

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.810
And so let's look at
an example of this.

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:49.900
Suppose that I have
a 10-year-old car,

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:51.880
and I keep it in pristine shape.

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.130
Hint-- that's not true for me.

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:55.255
I'm terrible at cars, but
imagine I was someone who

00:04:55.255 --> 00:04:56.380
wasn't.

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:58.570
I kept my 10-year-old
car in pristine shape.

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:04.720
And let's say that a 10-year-old
car in pristine shape is--

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:07.580
and let's say I'm
trying to sell this car.

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:10.670
And let's say that
I would happily

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:15.410
take $5,000 for this 10-year-old
car that's in pristine shape.

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:22.220
So I would be willing to sell at
$5 K. And let's say that you--

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:25.190
let's say Patricia--
needs that used car,

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:32.830
and she is willing to buy a car
that's in good shape for $6 K.

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:40.360
So my willingness to provide,
willingness to supply, is $5 K.

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:43.600
Her willingness to pay is $6 K.

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:46.700
So that is a transaction
that should happen.

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:50.030
Given the quality of my car,
given that's in good shape,

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:52.190
she is willing to pay
$1,000 more than I'm

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:53.660
willing to sell it for.

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:55.210
So that transaction
should happen,

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:57.670
and it would be
welfare maximizing.

00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:01.360
But let's say that most
10-year-old cars are not

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.340
in good shape.

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:07.270
Most 10-year-old cars, in fact,
are in kind of crappy shape.

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:11.020
And in fact, for the typical
10-year-old car, to get it up

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:12.610
and running well,
you'd have to throw

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:15.810
$2,000 in once you bought it.

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:17.580
And Patricia knows this.

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:19.950
She knows that for the
typical 10-year-old car,

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:22.840
she would have to put $2,000 in.

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:25.620
So her willingness
to pay is not $6 K,

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:30.512
it's $4 K for an
average 10-year-old car.

00:06:30.512 --> 00:06:31.970
Now I say to
Patricia, well, that's

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:33.440
an average
10-year-old car, but I

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:35.130
have a perfect 10-year-old car.

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:36.680
You don't need to
put $2 K into it.

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:38.443
It's good to go.

00:06:38.443 --> 00:06:40.610
So why don't we split the
difference and pay $5.5 K.

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:41.740
She says, no way.

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:43.430
You're a damn liar.

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:46.130
I have no way of knowing your
car is better than average.

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:47.840
All I know is the
average 10-year-old car

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:49.410
needs $2,000 of work.

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:52.940
So I'm not going to pay more
than $4,000 for your car.

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:56.230
As a result, Patricia
doesn't buy my car.

00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:58.750
And a transaction that would
have made both parties better

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:00.790
off does not happen.

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:02.925
A transaction where there
was full information,

00:07:02.925 --> 00:07:04.300
like we have much
more of today--

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:06.370
we can get the entire
record of the car,

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:09.220
all the crashes its been in, how
much care it's taken care of--

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:12.220
that problem would go
away, should go away,

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:14.410
because now, Patricia
could look at my CarFax

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:16.900
and note this, in fact,
is a pristine car.

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:19.760
And she's more willing
to pay the $6,000 for it.

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:23.110
But the bottom line is,
in this world of 1970,

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:27.010
this was a market failure,
because a transaction that

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:30.040
made both parties better
off did not happen because

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:33.860
of imperfect information.

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:35.980
The buyer was
perfectly happy to buy.

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:38.180
Patricia is perfectly
happy to buy my car,

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:40.880
but because I had information
that she didn't and she

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:44.480
was just suspicious that
I was lying, as a result,

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:46.930
that transaction didn't happen.

00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:49.810
Now, questions about that?

00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:52.920
People understand
it's a market failure.

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:55.220
Now we come to insurance.

00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:57.790
The story is flipped.

00:07:57.790 --> 00:08:01.383
Now it's not the seller
that has the information.

00:08:01.383 --> 00:08:03.050
It's the buyer that
has the information.

00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:05.600
In particular, when
you buy insurance,

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:08.030
you know how healthy you are.

00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:09.770
You know your genetic history.

00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:11.665
You know whether
you're a risk taker.

00:08:11.665 --> 00:08:13.790
You know whether you're
around a lot of snotty kids

00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:15.147
who might get you sick.

00:08:15.147 --> 00:08:16.730
You know a lot of
stuff about yourself

00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:19.640
that the insurer doesn't know.

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:23.000
As a result, the information
asymmetry is flipped.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.942
With insurance, the
insurer is worried

00:08:25.942 --> 00:08:27.650
that when you come
looking for insurance,

00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:28.910
they're worried you're looking
for insurance because you're

00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:29.923
sick.

00:08:29.923 --> 00:08:31.340
You might be looking
for insurance

00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:33.919
because you're risk averse
and that's great for insurers.

00:08:33.919 --> 00:08:37.039
We talked about insurance, how
there's essentially a game.

00:08:37.039 --> 00:08:39.650
I'm willing to pay a risk
premium so insurers can

00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:41.002
make money by selling to me.

00:08:41.002 --> 00:08:43.419
But what if I'm not coming to
you because I'm risk averse?

00:08:43.419 --> 00:08:45.669
What if I'm coming to you
because I'm a huge skydiving

00:08:45.669 --> 00:08:46.190
fan?

00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:47.712
And you don't know that.

00:08:47.712 --> 00:08:49.420
You might be afraid
to sell me insurance,

00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:52.890
because you might
lose money on me.

00:08:52.890 --> 00:08:55.530
So let's work out another
example to show this.

00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:58.560
Imagine you graduate,
and you decide

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:01.290
a great business model
is to offer health

00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:03.630
insurance to recent MIT grads.

00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:06.270
You say, look, we're a bunch
of kind of careful nerds.

00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:08.190
We're likely not
going to go skydiving.

00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:10.380
We're just going to sit
at our desks and work.

00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:12.870
Maybe there'll be carpal tunnel
risk, but other than that,

00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:14.012
we're a pretty safe bunch.

00:09:14.012 --> 00:09:16.470
So I'm going to offer health
insurance to recent MIT grads,

00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:19.000
because they're a healthy group.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:25.020
And let's say suppose that
of every 100 MIT grads,

00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:31.350
90 are healthy,
and 10 are sickly.

00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:33.385
Let's just suppose
you know those facts.

00:09:33.385 --> 00:09:34.260
You know those facts.

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:35.970
You've collected
the data to know

00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:38.970
that on average, of every 100
MIT grads, 90 are healthy,

00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:39.750
10 are sickly.

00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:43.860
You don't know which are which,
but you know the proportions.

00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:48.660
And let's say that
with a healthy person

00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:51.930
over the next year,
there's a 10% chance

00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:53.850
that they will need--

00:09:53.850 --> 00:10:05.220
that they will incur a $10,000
charge, and a 90% chance

00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:08.510
that they'll have zero costs.

00:10:08.510 --> 00:10:12.390
So there's a 10% chance of
a $10,000 cost, 90% chance

00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:15.380
they'll have a zero cost.

00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:23.020
So your expected cost for
insuring this person is $1,000.

00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:31.460
You expect someone like
that will cost you $1,000.

00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:37.400
Now suppose for the sickly
guy, there's a 50% chance

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:42.170
that they'll cost you $10 K,
and a 50% chance that they'll

00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:43.880
cost you 0.

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:47.210
So your expected costs for
them, the expected costs

00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:52.898
for this person, is $5,000.

00:10:52.898 --> 00:10:54.190
Do people understand the setup?

00:10:54.190 --> 00:10:55.840
There's two types.

00:10:55.840 --> 00:11:01.040
I know these facts, but
I don't know who's who.

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:03.550
I just know these facts,
because I'm good at math.

00:11:03.550 --> 00:11:05.480
I've done all the
actuarial calculations.

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:12.972
Now, if everyone buys in, now
I'm going to set my price.

00:11:12.972 --> 00:11:14.430
What am I doing to
do to the price?

00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:18.630
I'm going to say, look, if
everyone buys health insurance,

00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:24.360
then I've got my expected
cost is 0.9 times

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:29.430
1,000 plus 0.1 times 5,000.

00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:33.800
My expected cost is
1,400, so I expect

00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:35.400
to have to spend $1,400 a year.

00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:38.310
In fact, on average,
I'll spend $1,400 a year.

00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:41.130
With large enough samples, I can
predict that with certainty--

00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:45.810
that if everyone buys insurance,
I'll spend $1,400 a year.

00:11:45.810 --> 00:11:48.060
So let's say you're risk
neutral, because you're rich,

00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:49.140
and so forth.

00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:51.420
This is sort of risk
neutral for you.

00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:53.310
So you say, look,
I'll just charge--

00:11:53.310 --> 00:11:58.330
I'll set a premium of $1,500,
and I'll make $100 per person.

00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:00.930
If 100 will buy,
that's $10,000 profit.

00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:03.340
That's pretty good.

00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:05.540
There are 1,000 kids in
the graduating class.

00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:07.850
If 1,000 kids buy, and
I make $100 profit,

00:12:07.850 --> 00:12:09.560
then that's $100,000.

00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:12.554
That's pretty good
money for a year.

00:12:12.554 --> 00:12:19.240
Now, what is wrong
with this calculation?

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:23.590
What, in fact, will happen if
you sell insurance for $1,500?

00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:24.290
Yeah.

00:12:24.290 --> 00:12:25.540
AUDIENCE: We'll buy insurance.

00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:27.802
JONATHAN GRUBER: Well
let's go step by step.

00:12:27.802 --> 00:12:28.760
What about sick people?

00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:30.610
If you sell $1,500,
what will they do?

00:12:30.610 --> 00:12:31.590
AUDIENCE: They'll buy.

00:12:31.590 --> 00:12:33.673
JONATHAN GRUBER: Yes, so
if you set up for $1,500,

00:12:33.673 --> 00:12:37.150
you are certainly going
to sell to all the sick.

00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:39.550
So if you sell
for $1,500, you'll

00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:42.030
certainly sell to all the sick.

00:12:42.030 --> 00:12:44.110
What about the healthy?

00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:47.100
What will determine
whether or not they buy?

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:47.710
Yeah.

00:12:47.710 --> 00:12:50.228
AUDIENCE: When the
price is smaller

00:12:50.228 --> 00:12:52.590
than the expected amount
they'd have to pay on their own

00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:53.307
[INAUDIBLE].

00:12:53.307 --> 00:12:54.890
JONATHAN GRUBER: Not
quite, not quite.

00:12:54.890 --> 00:12:56.015
There's another piece, too.

00:12:56.015 --> 00:12:56.690
Don't forget.

00:12:56.690 --> 00:12:57.190
What else?

00:12:57.190 --> 00:12:58.100
What else?

00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:00.080
It's not just the expected cost.

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:00.663
What else?

00:13:00.663 --> 00:13:01.830
AUDIENCE: The risk aversion.

00:13:01.830 --> 00:13:03.350
JONATHAN GRUBER: The risk
aversion-- remember, there's

00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:05.320
a risk premium that they'll pay.

00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:07.280
So whether that
healthy person will buy

00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:10.970
or not, if it's just expected
cost, then they wouldn't buy--

00:13:10.970 --> 00:13:14.000
the $1,000 expected
cost, buy the $1,500.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.190
But some might be
risk averse and buy.

00:13:16.190 --> 00:13:19.100
So let's just say half
the guys are risk averse,

00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:21.860
and they're willing to pay
$1,500 for $1,000 expected

00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:23.320
costs in half are.

00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:25.670
So let's say you end up
selling to all the sick

00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:27.980
and half the healthy.

00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:29.900
So how much money do you make?

00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:35.220
Well, you sell the 60
people at $1,500 each,

00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:41.040
so your revenues are $75,000.

00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:44.940
You sell to 50 healthy and
10 sick, $75,000 revenues.

00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:46.870
What are your costs?

00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:51.600
Your costs are-- you have
10 people that are cost you

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:57.470
$5,000, so it's
$50,000, plus 50 people

00:13:57.470 --> 00:14:02.920
who are going to cost you
$1,000, plus another $50,000

00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:06.660
equals $100,000.

00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:09.910
And you've lost money.

00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:15.090
You priced at above the
expected total, and lost money.

00:14:15.090 --> 00:14:17.190
Why did you lose money?

00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:22.170
You lost money because of the
problem of adverse selection--

00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:30.320
the problem of we call
"adverse selection."

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:32.300
Adverse selection
is the problem that,

00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:36.730
due to information asymmetries,
only the worse risks

00:14:36.730 --> 00:14:39.680
will participate in the market.

00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:41.720
And that will cause people
selling in the market

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:44.180
to lose money, or
likewise here, the concern

00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:47.970
is that only the worst cars
will participate in the market.

00:14:47.970 --> 00:14:50.220
And so if people buy
cars, we'll be worse off.

00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:50.720
Yeah.

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:53.457
AUDIENCE: Wouldn't
you make $90,000?

00:14:53.457 --> 00:14:54.290
JONATHAN GRUBER: No.

00:14:54.290 --> 00:14:59.720
You sell to-- you sell $1,500
each, and you sell to--

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:00.470
yes, you're right.

00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:02.510
You make $90,000, my bad.

00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:05.240
Yes, $1,500 each times
60 people is $90,000.

00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:07.190
You still lose money,
but not as much.

00:15:07.190 --> 00:15:09.110
Right.

00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:13.410
Now, you might say, look,
you're not losing that much.

00:15:13.410 --> 00:15:16.640
Your solution-- just
raise the price.

00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:20.080
What if you said, fine,
let's just raise the price,

00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:24.460
and let's charge
$2,000 a person.

00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:26.920
Then that would cover,
because $2,000 a person,

00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:31.000
60 will make $120,000,
the costs are $100,000.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:32.620
You'd be golden, right?

00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:33.295
Yeah.

00:15:33.295 --> 00:15:34.600
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:35.350
JONATHAN GRUBER:
Who would you lose?

00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:36.070
AUDIENCE: The healthy.

00:15:36.070 --> 00:15:37.320
JONATHAN GRUBER: Not the sick.

00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:38.860
The sick are
delighted by $10,000.

00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:41.860
But once you raise the price,
more healthy people drop out,

00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:44.760
because it's higher
than their risk premium.

00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:46.427
So what happens is
by raising the price,

00:15:46.427 --> 00:15:48.218
you're not necessarily
going to make money.

00:15:48.218 --> 00:15:50.210
It depends on how many
healthy people drop out.

00:15:50.210 --> 00:15:57.173
So for example, imagine
that you raise it to $2,000,

00:15:57.173 --> 00:15:59.090
but now the number of
healthy people that buys

00:15:59.090 --> 00:16:02.030
drops to 20 from 50.

00:16:02.030 --> 00:16:04.170
Then you lose money again.

00:16:04.170 --> 00:16:05.835
So the point is,
you can't actually

00:16:05.835 --> 00:16:07.710
solve this problem just
by raising the price,

00:16:07.710 --> 00:16:11.230
because there's this what
we call "death spiral."

00:16:11.230 --> 00:16:13.350
This is a term called
"death spiral," which

00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:15.840
is as you raise the
price, you chase out

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:17.640
the healthier
people, which means

00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:19.110
you have to raise
the price more,

00:16:19.110 --> 00:16:21.480
which shakes out even
more healthy people.

00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:22.980
And you end up in
this death spiral.

00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:30.810
So that is the problem
of adverse selection.

00:16:30.810 --> 00:16:34.160
And that leads you to say,
you know what, I'm not

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:36.110
going to offer this product.

00:16:36.110 --> 00:16:39.030
I can't make money
on it, because if I

00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:42.977
set the price, whatever price
I set, I'm going to lose money.

00:16:42.977 --> 00:16:44.560
So I'm not going to
offer the product.

00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:46.770
Therefore, the
market has failed.

00:16:46.770 --> 00:16:48.570
A market that might
have existed--

00:16:48.570 --> 00:16:51.973
on average, this was a market
that made people better off,

00:16:51.973 --> 00:16:54.390
but the market that might have
existed doesn't does exist.

00:16:54.390 --> 00:16:55.394
Yeah.

00:16:55.394 --> 00:16:57.830
AUDIENCE: With the death
spiral, wouldn't it

00:16:57.830 --> 00:17:01.980
converge like something
equivalent [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:08.603
market forecasting is
[INAUDIBLE] still [INAUDIBLE]..

00:17:08.603 --> 00:17:10.770
JONATHAN GRUBER: Right, so
if you leave this alone--

00:17:10.770 --> 00:17:12.190
it's an excellent point--

00:17:12.190 --> 00:17:13.766
what should the
new equilibrium be?

00:17:13.766 --> 00:17:15.599
The price now should
potentially have chased

00:17:15.599 --> 00:17:17.869
all the healthy people out.

00:17:17.869 --> 00:17:19.805
And then you price,
but you'd have

00:17:19.805 --> 00:17:20.930
to price it, then, at what?

00:17:20.930 --> 00:17:22.097
AUDIENCE: $5,000 [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:22.097 --> 00:17:23.770
JONATHAN GRUBER:
$5,000 plus something.

00:17:23.770 --> 00:17:25.839
So as long as sick
people are risk averse,

00:17:25.839 --> 00:17:28.180
you could still make money.

00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:31.480
You could still make money
if you sold, say, $5,500

00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:33.130
with even modest risk aversion.

00:17:33.130 --> 00:17:36.141
Why is that still
a market failure?

00:17:36.141 --> 00:17:39.968
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:39.968 --> 00:17:42.510
JONATHAN GRUBER: Because there's
all these healthy people who

00:17:42.510 --> 00:17:45.000
now can't get health insurance.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.062
So yes, it doesn't mean
the market collapse--

00:17:47.062 --> 00:17:48.520
market failures
doesn't necessarily

00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:50.520
mean market collapse.

00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:52.770
It means a reduction in
welfare, because transactions

00:17:52.770 --> 00:17:55.140
that might make some people
better off aren't happening.

00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:57.270
Here, you might be
able to offer insurance

00:17:57.270 --> 00:17:58.470
for healthy people that
makes them better off,

00:17:58.470 --> 00:17:59.220
but you're not.

00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:02.000
You're only offering
insurance for the sick.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.400
So it's a market failure,
because healthy people

00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:08.970
who might want the insurance end
up being kept out of the market

00:18:08.970 --> 00:18:12.710
by adverse selection.

00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:15.450
Questions about that?

00:18:15.450 --> 00:18:17.460
And that is the
fundamental market failure

00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:18.700
we face in insurance markets.

00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:21.090
That's why we think private
insurance markets will not

00:18:21.090 --> 00:18:22.290
function well.

00:18:22.290 --> 00:18:24.690
Because private
insurers-- in some sense

00:18:24.690 --> 00:18:27.150
the fundamental
problem is that you're

00:18:27.150 --> 00:18:31.810
setting one price for
multiple products.

00:18:31.810 --> 00:18:33.690
A great case of
adverse selection

00:18:33.690 --> 00:18:35.830
is going to buy fruit
at the beginning

00:18:35.830 --> 00:18:37.650
versus the end of the day.

00:18:37.650 --> 00:18:39.090
What's the difference?

00:18:39.090 --> 00:18:41.978
Buy fruit at the beginning
or the end of the day?

00:18:41.978 --> 00:18:43.770
You guys probably don't
buy a lot of fruit,

00:18:43.770 --> 00:18:44.550
but try to think about it.

00:18:44.550 --> 00:18:45.225
Yeah.

00:18:45.225 --> 00:18:46.965
AUDIENCE: Normally, better is
at the beginning of the day.

00:18:46.965 --> 00:18:47.400
Then you have--

00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:48.390
JONATHAN GRUBER: And
at the end of the day,

00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:49.840
in particular, what's left?

00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:50.715
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:50.715 --> 00:18:52.257
JONATHAN GRUBER:
All the shitty fruit

00:18:52.257 --> 00:18:53.800
is left, because
you set one price.

00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:57.000
You didn't say good apples
$1.80, shitty apples $1.40.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.420
You said apples, $1.70.

00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:01.220
So people come, and
they buy apples.

00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:02.552
They go and they feel it.

00:19:02.552 --> 00:19:03.260
They feel around.

00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:04.260
They find the good ones.

00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:06.790
The ones that left are crap.

00:19:06.790 --> 00:19:09.070
And that is the adverse
selection problem.

00:19:09.070 --> 00:19:13.090
Now, with apples, the
market still exists.

00:19:13.090 --> 00:19:13.750
Why?

00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:17.050
Because they charge so much they
can live with a few bad apples

00:19:17.050 --> 00:19:18.490
being at the bottom,
so to speak--

00:19:18.490 --> 00:19:20.560
a few bad apples
being at the bottom.

00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:24.310
With health insurance,
if I get one bad risk--

00:19:24.310 --> 00:19:26.860
someone, say, who's
really, really sick

00:19:26.860 --> 00:19:28.300
and costs $1, million--

00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:30.750
I go out of business.

00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:33.770
So adverse selection
may not destroy markets.

00:19:33.770 --> 00:19:36.010
It doesn't destroy
the apple market,

00:19:36.010 --> 00:19:38.110
but it can destroy or
significantly impede

00:19:38.110 --> 00:19:40.840
insurance markets.

00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:42.480
Questions about that?

00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:43.020
Yeah.

00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:43.240
Manny.

00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:45.198
AUDIENCE: Is there some
way insurance companies

00:19:45.198 --> 00:19:50.155
that hassle hospitals, like
lower the prices or they give

00:19:50.155 --> 00:19:51.530
them better
discounts so they can

00:19:51.530 --> 00:19:53.430
increase the price of people--

00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:54.350
JONATHAN GRUBER: Well,
that's a separate issue.

00:19:54.350 --> 00:19:55.400
We'll talk about
that next lecture

00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:56.300
when we talk about health care.

00:19:56.300 --> 00:19:58.340
So that's separate, about
the cost of health care.

00:19:58.340 --> 00:20:00.090
This is the reason why
insurance companies

00:20:00.090 --> 00:20:03.230
make you fill out a lot
of forms before you go in.

00:20:03.230 --> 00:20:05.660
So it's for this reason--

00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:08.958
insurance companies are not
powerless against this problem.

00:20:08.958 --> 00:20:11.250
They could try to collect as
much information about you

00:20:11.250 --> 00:20:12.540
as they can.

00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:14.530
As I get more and
more [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:14.530 --> 00:20:16.860
can learn more and more
who's healthy, who's sick,

00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:18.110
then I can solve this problem.

00:20:21.290 --> 00:20:24.582
AUDIENCE: So your
familiar with those

00:20:24.582 --> 00:20:26.790
home kits that [INAUDIBLE]
and 23andme will send you.

00:20:26.790 --> 00:20:29.050
JONATHAN GRUBER: Yeah, 23andme.

00:20:29.050 --> 00:20:29.925
Yeah.

00:20:29.925 --> 00:20:34.290
AUDIENCE: So is it
possible that at some point

00:20:34.290 --> 00:20:36.390
in the foreseeable
future, those are going

00:20:36.390 --> 00:20:39.938
to become part of [INAUDIBLE]?

00:20:39.938 --> 00:20:42.580
Those are going to become part
of how insurance is determined,

00:20:42.580 --> 00:20:46.340
like if it's in your DNA,
get some condition when

00:20:46.340 --> 00:20:48.840
you get old that we can say you
have a preexisting condition

00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:50.360
now that hasn't manifested yet?

00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:52.110
JONATHAN GRUBER: So
this is a great point.

00:20:52.110 --> 00:20:53.735
I was going to talk
about it next time.

00:20:53.735 --> 00:20:56.790
I'll talk about it now,
which is in some sense,

00:20:56.790 --> 00:20:59.850
we are eventually
moving to a point

00:20:59.850 --> 00:21:01.960
where there'll be no
adverse selection.

00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:03.710
Now you might say, on
the one hand, that's

00:21:03.710 --> 00:21:05.330
because ultimately, we'll
know everything about you

00:21:05.330 --> 00:21:06.950
from the moment you're born.

00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:08.180
We know your genes.

00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:10.700
We won't know if you're a
skydiver, but we'll know--

00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:13.210
we'll probably know genes
that determine risk taking.

00:21:13.210 --> 00:21:17.100
And we'll charge more for
people who like taking risks.

00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:23.580
So the good news is that then,
I can make the market work.

00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:28.854
The bad news is in that world,
how would I set my insurance?

00:21:28.854 --> 00:21:30.625
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:30.625 --> 00:21:32.000
JONATHAN GRUBER:
I would charge--

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:33.458
because what I
would do is I'd say,

00:21:33.458 --> 00:21:37.340
your genes say you're healthy,
so I want $1,100 from you.

00:21:37.340 --> 00:21:41.040
Your genes say you're sick,
so I want $6,000 from you.

00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:45.050
So essentially, insurance
wouldn't exist anymore.

00:21:45.050 --> 00:21:46.050
There'd be no insurance.

00:21:46.050 --> 00:21:47.310
What is insurance?

00:21:47.310 --> 00:21:50.310
Insurance is pooling people
with different probabilities

00:21:50.310 --> 00:21:53.430
of adverse events, and letting
us all benefit from the fact

00:21:53.430 --> 00:21:55.920
that if it happens to us,
at least we're protected.

00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:58.170
Well, if you charge
me my expected cost,

00:21:58.170 --> 00:21:59.993
I'm no longer protected.

00:21:59.993 --> 00:22:02.160
So here's the example that
makes it perfectly clear,

00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:03.330
one of the most famous examples.

00:22:03.330 --> 00:22:05.913
Ken Arrow was one of the great
economists of the 20th century,

00:22:05.913 --> 00:22:06.960
died recently.

00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:08.442
He had his famous
islands example.

00:22:08.442 --> 00:22:10.650
Ken Arrow's island example
is the following-- imagine

00:22:10.650 --> 00:22:13.300
there's two islands somewhere
in the South Pacific

00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:15.870
that are very small, that's
got one farmer on each.

00:22:15.870 --> 00:22:18.760
And the farmers know
a hurricane is coming

00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:20.760
and it's going to wipe
out one of their islands,

00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:22.710
but they don't know which.

00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:24.663
They just know one's
getting wiped out.

00:22:24.663 --> 00:22:25.830
What will they naturally do?

00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:28.020
They'll naturally get
together and say, look,

00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:30.270
islands get wiped out, but
let's insure each other.

00:22:30.270 --> 00:22:32.180
If I get wiped out, you give
me a bunch of your crop.

00:22:32.180 --> 00:22:34.472
If you get wiped out, I'll
give you a bunch of my crop.

00:22:34.472 --> 00:22:36.120
That will improve
both our welfare,

00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:37.590
because getting wiped
out is going to zero.

00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:38.090
You die.

00:22:38.090 --> 00:22:39.600
That's a terrible outcome.

00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:42.810
So that will improve our
welfare if we insure each other.

00:22:42.810 --> 00:22:45.480
Now let's say a weather service
comes along, and provides

00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:47.497
information, and
tells you that farmer

00:22:47.497 --> 00:22:49.830
A's island is getting wiped
out and farmer B's island is

00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:51.530
going to be fine.

00:22:51.530 --> 00:22:54.020
What has happened to welfare?

00:22:54.020 --> 00:22:55.650
It's gotten worse.

00:22:55.650 --> 00:22:56.267
Why?

00:22:56.267 --> 00:22:57.892
Because farmer A goes
to farmer B, says

00:22:57.892 --> 00:22:59.517
it turns out I'm
going to be wiped out.

00:22:59.517 --> 00:23:00.760
Farmer B says, well, see you.

00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:03.130
I'm just going to keep
consuming my high level.

00:23:03.130 --> 00:23:04.950
Farmer B is somewhat better off.

00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:07.850
Farmer A is dead.

00:23:07.850 --> 00:23:10.850
Total social welfare has
fallen because the concavity,

00:23:10.850 --> 00:23:12.830
because diminishing
market utility.

00:23:12.830 --> 00:23:16.280
More information
has made us worse.

00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:17.773
We say more is
better in economics.

00:23:17.773 --> 00:23:19.940
Once you get into topics
like, this you realize more

00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:21.090
is not always better.

00:23:21.090 --> 00:23:22.370
More is worse.

00:23:22.370 --> 00:23:24.560
More information has
destroyed the insurance market

00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:26.220
that might function.

00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:28.370
So in fact, this issue
I'm talking about

00:23:28.370 --> 00:23:31.010
is becoming paramount
as we move more and more

00:23:31.010 --> 00:23:33.585
towards perfect
information environment.

00:23:33.585 --> 00:23:35.960
So the kind of government
policies I'm talking about next

00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:39.368
become critical as you move
towards that environment.

00:23:39.368 --> 00:23:40.910
But first, I want
to make sure we all

00:23:40.910 --> 00:23:43.100
understand why the
private markets failed,

00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:46.040
why it's a failure.

00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:48.810
Now, what can the
government do about this?

00:23:48.810 --> 00:23:51.710
What are some potential
government solutions?

00:23:51.710 --> 00:23:54.210
And we've tried all of these
in the US and around the world.

00:23:54.210 --> 00:23:55.585
Let's talk about
three categories

00:23:55.585 --> 00:23:57.150
of government solutions.

00:23:57.150 --> 00:23:59.780
The first is subsidization.

00:24:02.810 --> 00:24:05.090
The government could
subsidize the purchase

00:24:05.090 --> 00:24:06.290
of health insurance.

00:24:06.290 --> 00:24:09.500
So for example, what if
the US government said

00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:13.730
to all the MIT grads, I'm
going to give you a $400

00:24:13.730 --> 00:24:17.750
tax credit that you could have--

00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:22.953
or $500 tax credit if
you buy health insurance.

00:24:22.953 --> 00:24:24.370
Well, if there's
a $500 tax credit

00:24:24.370 --> 00:24:28.410
if I buy health insurance,
and I charge $1,500,

00:24:28.410 --> 00:24:30.730
then what's the effective
price now to the healthy guy?

00:24:30.730 --> 00:24:31.647
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:31.647 --> 00:24:33.192
JONATHAN GRUBER:
$1,000, so he buys.

00:24:33.192 --> 00:24:34.984
Even if he's risk
neutral, he buys, as long

00:24:34.984 --> 00:24:36.950
as he's a tiny bit risk averse.

00:24:36.950 --> 00:24:38.250
So I do sell to everyone.

00:24:38.250 --> 00:24:40.332
I make my money.

00:24:40.332 --> 00:24:41.790
So one way to solve
this problem is

00:24:41.790 --> 00:24:44.970
to basically pay the healthy
people to get into the market.

00:24:44.970 --> 00:24:46.260
They can't just give money
to the healthy people.

00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:47.370
You've got to give
it to everyone,

00:24:47.370 --> 00:24:49.170
because you can't
tell who's healthy.

00:24:49.170 --> 00:24:52.050
But if we give
everyone a tax credit,

00:24:52.050 --> 00:24:54.210
then we could bring
everyone to the market

00:24:54.210 --> 00:24:56.020
and solve this problem.

00:24:56.020 --> 00:24:58.170
Well, in fact, we
do this in America.

00:24:58.170 --> 00:25:01.230
It's actually perhaps the
largest hidden government

00:25:01.230 --> 00:25:03.700
expenditure in
our country, which

00:25:03.700 --> 00:25:12.510
is the tax subsidy to
employer-sponsored insurance,

00:25:12.510 --> 00:25:14.338
employer health insurance.

00:25:17.783 --> 00:25:19.700
The tax subsidy on
employer health insurance--

00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:20.880
what do I mean by that?

00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:24.530
What I mean is the following--
when MIT pays me in wages,

00:25:24.530 --> 00:25:26.810
I am taxed on that, like
the taxation we talked

00:25:26.810 --> 00:25:28.810
about a couple lectures ago.

00:25:28.810 --> 00:25:30.940
When MIT pays me in
health insurance,

00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:33.092
I am not taxed on that.

00:25:33.092 --> 00:25:34.050
So what does that mean?

00:25:34.050 --> 00:25:35.425
If MIT comes to
me, and they say,

00:25:35.425 --> 00:25:39.050
would you like $1,000 raise
or $1,000 orthodontic benefits

00:25:39.050 --> 00:25:40.370
for your daughter?

00:25:40.370 --> 00:25:42.560
I say, well, $1,000 raise
in today's tax rates,

00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:44.432
I'm going to take
home about $550.

00:25:44.432 --> 00:25:45.890
If you add up all
the tax I'll pay,

00:25:45.890 --> 00:25:48.942
then I'll take home about $550.

00:25:48.942 --> 00:25:50.900
$1,000 of orthodontic
benefits for my daughter,

00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:52.430
I get the whole $1,000.

00:25:52.430 --> 00:25:53.015
So why not?

00:25:53.015 --> 00:25:54.140
So I got these cool braces.

00:25:54.140 --> 00:25:55.310
They spin and change color.

00:25:55.310 --> 00:25:57.852
And every two weeks, she's in
for a different kind of braces.

00:25:57.852 --> 00:26:00.480
It's great, because it's free.

00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:04.440
So we do subsidize health
insurance in America.

00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:06.145
And this amounts
to-- this program

00:26:06.145 --> 00:26:10.230
that I just talked about
amounts to almost $300 billion

00:26:10.230 --> 00:26:11.580
per year.

00:26:11.580 --> 00:26:14.370
We spend almost $300
billion per year

00:26:14.370 --> 00:26:19.050
giving a tax break to people
to buy health insurance.

00:26:19.050 --> 00:26:21.390
So that's one tactic
we take to try

00:26:21.390 --> 00:26:24.030
to solve this problem to get
healthy people into the market.

00:26:24.030 --> 00:26:26.450
That's approach one.

00:26:26.450 --> 00:26:29.240
A second approach one can
use to try to get people

00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:31.130
into the market is a mandate.

00:26:33.660 --> 00:26:36.120
Suppose I just pass a
law that says everyone

00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:38.010
has to buy health insurance.

00:26:38.010 --> 00:26:40.080
Then I've solved the problem.

00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:43.500
I know what my expected costs
are if everyone has to buy.

00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:45.240
I know my expected
costs are $1,400,

00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:48.970
so I know I can make
money at $1,500.

00:26:48.970 --> 00:26:51.230
That's easier at one level.

00:26:51.230 --> 00:26:52.550
I don't have to spend--

00:26:52.550 --> 00:26:53.800
$30 billion is a lot of money.

00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:55.872
This cost me $0.

00:26:55.872 --> 00:26:57.080
It's harder on another level.

00:26:57.080 --> 00:26:57.830
Why?

00:26:57.830 --> 00:26:59.760
What's the problem
with that solution?

00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:00.847
Yeah.

00:27:00.847 --> 00:27:02.722
AUDIENCE: Not having
the money for insurance.

00:27:02.722 --> 00:27:03.190
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:27:03.190 --> 00:27:05.150
JONATHAN GRUBER: Well,
it may not have it.

00:27:05.150 --> 00:27:05.750
That's right.

00:27:05.750 --> 00:27:07.160
What else?

00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:07.680
Yeah.

00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:08.750
AUDIENCE: He may not want it.

00:27:08.750 --> 00:27:11.208
JONATHAN GRUBER: The healthy
people are going to be pissed.

00:27:11.208 --> 00:27:13.280
They're like, look,
if I had chosen not--

00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:14.720
you're going to basically--

00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:16.640
the mandate only
has an effect if it

00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:18.060
changes people's behavior.

00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:19.100
But changing people's
behavior means

00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:20.600
you're making them
do something they

00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:22.130
didn't want to do beforehand.

00:27:22.130 --> 00:27:24.940
So the problem with that
the problem with this is you

00:27:24.940 --> 00:27:25.980
spend a lot of money.

00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:28.030
The problem this is you
piss off healthy people.

00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:34.030
The third approach we could do--

00:27:34.030 --> 00:27:35.880
there's lots of
examples of a mandate.

00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:37.150
Obviously, we know about
the health insurance

00:27:37.150 --> 00:27:39.370
mandate that was originally
part of Obamacare.

00:27:39.370 --> 00:27:41.050
But that's not the
biggest example.

00:27:41.050 --> 00:27:42.970
The biggest example
in the US is what's

00:27:42.970 --> 00:27:47.380
called "Workers' Comp
Insurance," which is insurance

00:27:47.380 --> 00:27:49.750
that you have for
on-the-job injuries.

00:27:49.750 --> 00:27:53.020
If you get hurt at work, your
employer pays money so that you

00:27:53.020 --> 00:27:55.193
get reimbursed when you're--

00:27:55.193 --> 00:27:57.360
it pays your medical bills
when you get hurt at work

00:27:57.360 --> 00:28:00.400
and gives you partial
replacement of your wages.

00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:02.770
That is mandated
insurance on all employers

00:28:02.770 --> 00:28:05.830
in America, except in Texas.

00:28:05.830 --> 00:28:06.880
Texas, they can choose.

00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:08.791
Every other state,
it's mandated.

00:28:08.791 --> 00:28:11.168
Mandated insurance for
every employer in America.

00:28:11.168 --> 00:28:12.460
They have to buy Workers' Comp.

00:28:12.460 --> 00:28:13.543
So we've examples of that.

00:28:13.543 --> 00:28:15.700
And that's an $80
billion a year program.

00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:17.660
That's a big deal.

00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:21.560
Finally, we can just
provide the insurance.

00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:27.000
That's actually the most
common thing we do in America.

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:30.240
Social Security is our program
that provides insurance

00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:34.560
for the elderly, for the costs
for survival after retirement.

00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:39.150
Medicare is insurance for
the elderly we provide.

00:28:39.150 --> 00:28:41.280
Unemployment
insurance is insurance

00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:43.470
we provide against
losing your job.

00:28:43.470 --> 00:28:45.840
Disability insurance
is insurance

00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:49.840
we provide against having
a career-ending disability.

00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:51.590
So this is actually
the most common thing.

00:28:51.590 --> 00:28:55.180
Indeed, provision of
social insurance in America

00:28:55.180 --> 00:28:56.380
costs almost--

00:28:56.380 --> 00:29:00.210
costs more than
private insurance.

00:29:00.210 --> 00:29:02.710
So we spend about a trillion
and a half on private insurance

00:29:02.710 --> 00:29:03.730
in America.

00:29:03.730 --> 00:29:06.340
Social insurance is probably
about $1.7 to $2 trillion,

00:29:06.340 --> 00:29:08.710
depending how you measure it.

00:29:08.710 --> 00:29:10.410
So actually, this
is the biggest thing

00:29:10.410 --> 00:29:14.320
we do is we just
provide insurance,

00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:18.300
and that is a very
large solution.

00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:21.570
Now once again, what's
the problem with this?

00:29:21.570 --> 00:29:24.310
You don't make the
healthy people unhappy,

00:29:24.310 --> 00:29:26.240
because everyone, you
just give it to them.

00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:28.580
The problem is you have
to spend money on this.

00:29:28.580 --> 00:29:31.760
This is $1.7 trillion in taxes
we've got to raise every year.

00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:34.460
That's non-trivial.

00:29:34.460 --> 00:29:36.230
So basically, each
of these solutions

00:29:36.230 --> 00:29:38.570
has potential problems.

00:29:38.570 --> 00:29:41.540
So the adverse selection problem
will cause the private market

00:29:41.540 --> 00:29:42.540
to fail.

00:29:42.540 --> 00:29:44.350
There are potential
government solutions,

00:29:44.350 --> 00:29:45.470
but they each have limitations.

00:29:45.470 --> 00:29:47.840
This one's pretty expensive,
this one's super expensive,

00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:50.730
this one pisses
off healthy people.

00:29:50.730 --> 00:29:53.595
Now, you'll note the middle one,
the pissed-off healthy people

00:29:53.595 --> 00:29:54.640
is kind of subtle.

00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:56.515
You don't see a lot of
healthy people railing

00:29:56.515 --> 00:29:58.310
against mandated
[INAUDIBLE] Workers' Comp

00:29:58.310 --> 00:30:00.435
like they did against the
health insurance mandate,

00:30:00.435 --> 00:30:01.830
because people don't know.

00:30:01.830 --> 00:30:04.320
So in some sense, this
one's a little bit subtle,

00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:06.690
because people have to know.

00:30:06.690 --> 00:30:08.942
Basically, it's sort
of crazy that I'm

00:30:08.942 --> 00:30:10.900
paying tax that I'm never
getting hurt at work.

00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:11.810
Am I going to have--

00:30:11.810 --> 00:30:14.718
what am I going to do, like
slip at my desk or something?

00:30:14.718 --> 00:30:17.260
Never going to get hurt at work,
but I pay taxes all the time

00:30:17.260 --> 00:30:19.860
just in case someone
else at MIT gets hurt.

00:30:19.860 --> 00:30:22.590
Some of the janitorial staff
has a risk of being hurt.

00:30:22.590 --> 00:30:25.290
I'm paying taxes in case
the janitor gets hurt.

00:30:25.290 --> 00:30:28.620
I should be upset about
that, but I'm not.

00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:30.810
And in some sense, it's
about what people know,

00:30:30.810 --> 00:30:32.910
what they don't.

00:30:32.910 --> 00:30:38.150
So that is the basic argument
for social insurance.

00:30:38.150 --> 00:30:39.830
But when we provide
social insurance

00:30:39.830 --> 00:30:42.380
despite all these
problems, we enter

00:30:42.380 --> 00:30:45.770
into a fundamental
trade-off, which

00:30:45.770 --> 00:30:47.208
is, let's decide
we've determined

00:30:47.208 --> 00:30:48.500
some optimal government policy.

00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:50.300
Let's decide that
the markets failed,

00:30:50.300 --> 00:30:51.640
so we're going to do
one of these things

00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:54.223
or are some combination of these
things and solve the problem.

00:30:54.223 --> 00:30:59.570
The problem is that when
you insure people for risks

00:30:59.570 --> 00:31:02.350
you create a new problem
called "moral hazard."

00:31:05.930 --> 00:31:15.570
Moral hazard is basically
the adverse behavior that

00:31:15.570 --> 00:31:18.950
is encouraged by insurance.

00:31:18.950 --> 00:31:24.180
When you insure people, you
encourage adverse behavior.

00:31:24.180 --> 00:31:26.480
So the classic
example of this is--

00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:29.510
if I have health insurance, I
ride my bike less carefully,

00:31:29.510 --> 00:31:30.870
because if I get in a crash--

00:31:30.870 --> 00:31:31.970
I'm not crazy.

00:31:31.970 --> 00:31:33.020
I certainly don't want
to get in a crash,

00:31:33.020 --> 00:31:34.130
but I'm a little
bit less careful

00:31:34.130 --> 00:31:36.470
because I know I'm insured
in case I get in a crash.

00:31:36.470 --> 00:31:39.380
If I have fire insurance, I
don't buy a fire extinguisher

00:31:39.380 --> 00:31:41.270
for my house, because
if it burns down,

00:31:41.270 --> 00:31:43.580
I'm just going to get
the money back anyway.

00:31:43.580 --> 00:31:46.880
Or if workers have insurance
against losing a job that

00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:49.340
pays them when out of work,
they might search less hard

00:31:49.340 --> 00:31:51.320
for a new job.

00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:53.570
Basically, if I lose my
job and I got nothing,

00:31:53.570 --> 00:31:54.930
I'm going to work my ass
off to get a new job.

00:31:54.930 --> 00:31:56.388
If I lose my job
and the government

00:31:56.388 --> 00:31:59.212
says, well, for 26 weeks,
we'll give you half your salary

00:31:59.212 --> 00:32:01.670
while you look for a job, I'll
be a little bit less rushed.

00:32:04.690 --> 00:32:07.530
And there's lots of evidence
that moral hazard is a problem.

00:32:07.530 --> 00:32:09.220
I comes with two
types of evidence.

00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:12.060
The first type evidence
is fun anecdotes.

00:32:12.060 --> 00:32:14.380
So the great effect that--
workers' compensation, let's

00:32:14.380 --> 00:32:14.880
take that.

00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:17.255
Workers' compensation, it's
a program [INAUDIBLE] needed.

00:32:17.255 --> 00:32:18.630
Lots of people get hurt at work.

00:32:18.630 --> 00:32:20.925
I don't, but lots of
people do get hurt at work.

00:32:20.925 --> 00:32:23.920
And so it's a sensible
social insurance program.

00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:26.460
The problem is it has a
huge moral hazard component.

00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:28.200
And there's fun
examples of this,

00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:31.410
like the prison guard
in Massachusetts

00:32:31.410 --> 00:32:33.270
who claimed he got
hurt on the job,

00:32:33.270 --> 00:32:36.870
collected $82,000 in benefits,
while the whole time running

00:32:36.870 --> 00:32:38.842
a karate school and
teaching students karate.

00:32:38.842 --> 00:32:40.800
And finally someone
noticed online this guy who

00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:42.900
couldn't work was
running a karate school

00:32:42.900 --> 00:32:45.090
and doing karate kicks
and stuff online.

00:32:45.090 --> 00:32:47.520
So there's all sorts of
fun examples about that.

00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:48.960
But more convincing
for economists

00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:50.970
is statistical evidence.

00:32:50.970 --> 00:32:53.070
And the statistical
evidence is clear

00:32:53.070 --> 00:32:56.160
that moral hazard
is a big problem.

00:32:56.160 --> 00:32:59.090
For example, if you raise
the benefits people get

00:32:59.090 --> 00:33:02.135
under workers' comp, suddenly
they become injured more often

00:33:02.135 --> 00:33:03.800
and stay out of work longer.

00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:06.530
There's no reason-- injuries
should be because you got hurt.

00:33:06.530 --> 00:33:08.030
So how can it be
that suddenly, when

00:33:08.030 --> 00:33:09.613
a state raises its
benefits, suddenly,

00:33:09.613 --> 00:33:10.580
there's more injuries?

00:33:10.580 --> 00:33:12.760
The answer is moral hazard.

00:33:12.760 --> 00:33:14.800
When states raise their
unemployment insurance

00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:17.350
benefits, more people
leave their jobs and they

00:33:17.350 --> 00:33:19.260
stay unemployed longer--

00:33:19.260 --> 00:33:21.300
moral hazard.

00:33:21.300 --> 00:33:24.060
So the moral hazard
problem is real.

00:33:24.060 --> 00:33:26.263
It's an inherent trade-off,
actually not just

00:33:26.263 --> 00:33:27.180
with public insurance.

00:33:27.180 --> 00:33:29.160
Private insurance,
too-- anytime you

00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:31.558
insure people and
something bad happens,

00:33:31.558 --> 00:33:33.100
you're providing
less of an incentive

00:33:33.100 --> 00:33:38.740
for them to try themselves to
avoid that bad thing happening.

00:33:38.740 --> 00:33:41.390
So moral hazard
is a real problem

00:33:41.390 --> 00:33:43.060
and it's essentially
the trade-off.

00:33:43.060 --> 00:33:47.087
On the one hand, we talked
about why people like insurance.

00:33:47.087 --> 00:33:49.420
We talked about why people
like private insurers because

00:33:49.420 --> 00:33:50.290
of risk aversion.

00:33:50.290 --> 00:33:52.510
We talked about why government
intervention insurance

00:33:52.510 --> 00:33:54.130
in markets is necessary.

00:33:54.130 --> 00:33:56.080
But that comes with
the trade-off, which

00:33:56.080 --> 00:33:58.450
is the more insurance
you provide,

00:33:58.450 --> 00:34:01.130
the less people take
care of themselves.

00:34:01.130 --> 00:34:03.290
And that's the trade-off.

00:34:03.290 --> 00:34:06.090
Now, why do we care?

00:34:06.090 --> 00:34:08.590
Let's just sit back and say,
that's an interesting economics

00:34:08.590 --> 00:34:09.715
concept, but why do I care?

00:34:09.715 --> 00:34:12.489
Why do I care if someone stays
out of work longer, fakes

00:34:12.489 --> 00:34:14.920
an injury, or whatever?

00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:16.300
Why do I care about this?

00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:17.790
Why is this a problem?

00:34:17.790 --> 00:34:19.960
It's a problem for two reasons.

00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:22.650
There's two costs
to moral hazard.

00:34:22.650 --> 00:34:31.981
The first cost to moral
hazard is lower efficiency.

00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:36.540
And the best way
to see this is just

00:34:36.540 --> 00:34:39.239
to think about the economics
of the consumption/leisure

00:34:39.239 --> 00:34:41.960
trade-off.

00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:44.630
Think about how I make my
decision of how hard to work.

00:34:47.510 --> 00:34:51.050
Basically, if there's no
insurance, no social insurance,

00:34:51.050 --> 00:34:53.790
no workers' comp, no
unemployment insurance,

00:34:53.790 --> 00:34:58.410
how do I choose
how hard to work?

00:34:58.410 --> 00:35:01.350
How do I choose
how hard to work?

00:35:01.350 --> 00:35:02.150
How do I do that?

00:35:02.150 --> 00:35:05.050
What's the trade-off I consider
in deciding how hard to work?

00:35:07.890 --> 00:35:08.543
Yeah.

00:35:08.543 --> 00:35:09.450
AUDIENCE: Consumption
versus leisure.

00:35:09.450 --> 00:35:11.283
JONATHAN GRUBER:
Consumption versus leisure,

00:35:11.283 --> 00:35:14.220
in particular, I
will trade them off

00:35:14.220 --> 00:35:17.440
until the marginal value of
the next hour of leisure--

00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:18.870
marginal value of leisure--

00:35:18.870 --> 00:35:21.750
equals the wage.

00:35:21.750 --> 00:35:24.620
Because the marginal value
of leisure is above the wage,

00:35:24.620 --> 00:35:25.620
I should work less hard.

00:35:25.620 --> 00:35:27.630
That means I'd
rather be at home.

00:35:27.630 --> 00:35:29.757
If the marginal value of
leisure is below the wage,

00:35:29.757 --> 00:35:31.590
that means I'm just
wasting my time at home.

00:35:31.590 --> 00:35:33.243
I should work harder.

00:35:33.243 --> 00:35:35.160
So I'll continue to trade
off work and leisure

00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:37.050
till the next hour
of leisure makes

00:35:37.050 --> 00:35:40.590
me just as happy as the
next hour of working.

00:35:40.590 --> 00:35:43.330
And that is the
efficient outcome.

00:35:43.330 --> 00:35:45.010
That is the socially
efficient outcome,

00:35:45.010 --> 00:35:47.050
because leisure is
not a social bad.

00:35:47.050 --> 00:35:49.540
There's nothing
wrong with leisure.

00:35:49.540 --> 00:35:51.100
People value leisure.

00:35:51.100 --> 00:35:53.290
They should get to trade
off the leisure versus what

00:35:53.290 --> 00:35:55.623
they get from working till
they choose the right amount.

00:35:55.623 --> 00:35:57.930
That's what makes
society best off.

00:35:57.930 --> 00:36:02.370
Now, what happens if I
say, if you sit at home,

00:36:02.370 --> 00:36:06.460
you're also going to get a
check from the government?

00:36:06.460 --> 00:36:08.530
Now, what's my new equation?

00:36:08.530 --> 00:36:11.370
Now, if I work, I
still get the wage.

00:36:11.370 --> 00:36:13.110
But what happens
if I sit at home?

00:36:13.110 --> 00:36:17.100
I get the marginal value of
leisure plus the government

00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:19.770
check.

00:36:19.770 --> 00:36:24.538
So now I sit at home until
this equation is true,

00:36:24.538 --> 00:36:26.830
which means that I sit at
home until the marginal value

00:36:26.830 --> 00:36:31.310
of leisure equals the wage
minus the government transfer.

00:36:34.380 --> 00:36:36.810
That means the marginal
value of leisure

00:36:36.810 --> 00:36:40.980
will be lower than it would
be without the government

00:36:40.980 --> 00:36:42.600
transfer, which
means I work what?

00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:44.490
More hard or less hard?

00:36:44.490 --> 00:36:47.157
If the marginal value of
leisure is forced down,

00:36:47.157 --> 00:36:48.240
that means I'm doing what?

00:36:51.583 --> 00:36:52.666
Someone raised their hand.

00:36:52.666 --> 00:36:52.893
Yeah.

00:36:52.893 --> 00:36:53.600
AUDIENCE: More leisure.

00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:55.250
JONATHAN GRUBER: More
leisure, because remember,

00:36:55.250 --> 00:36:57.292
there's diminishing marginal
value of everything,

00:36:57.292 --> 00:37:00.050
so I'm taking more
leisure, less work.

00:37:00.050 --> 00:37:02.450
So the government is
causing me to work less

00:37:02.450 --> 00:37:04.790
by essentially saying,
look, I'm going to reward

00:37:04.790 --> 00:37:07.830
you more for staying at home.

00:37:07.830 --> 00:37:09.120
What does that do?

00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:13.050
That means that people work
less than is socially optimal.

00:37:13.050 --> 00:37:15.990
This is the social optimum.

00:37:15.990 --> 00:37:18.210
This means people are
taking more leisure

00:37:18.210 --> 00:37:20.760
and working less than
is socially optimal.

00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:23.910
When people work less, that
shifts in the supply curve

00:37:23.910 --> 00:37:26.590
and creates a deadweight loss.

00:37:26.590 --> 00:37:30.040
Social welfare has fallen.

00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:32.260
Let me remind you, it's
not falling because people

00:37:32.260 --> 00:37:34.090
take some time off.

00:37:34.090 --> 00:37:36.580
Many people on the conservative
side of the spectrum

00:37:36.580 --> 00:37:38.620
will act as if work is a virtue.

00:37:38.620 --> 00:37:41.380
Work is not a virtue.

00:37:41.380 --> 00:37:44.432
The optimal solution is to work
until your value of working

00:37:44.432 --> 00:37:45.640
equals your value of leisure.

00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:48.520
If you're someone who
has a job that you hate

00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:51.590
and doesn't pay well,
and you love watching TV,

00:37:51.590 --> 00:37:52.660
you should work less.

00:37:52.660 --> 00:37:55.270
That's what's
optimal for society.

00:37:55.270 --> 00:37:58.360
But you shouldn't work even
less because the government's

00:37:58.360 --> 00:38:00.150
paying you to stay home.

00:38:00.150 --> 00:38:02.530
That reduces efficiency.

00:38:02.530 --> 00:38:05.238
So that's a problem of moral
hazard is it lowers efficiency.

00:38:05.238 --> 00:38:06.780
There is a second
problem, of course,

00:38:06.780 --> 00:38:10.840
of moral hazard, which
is if you work less,

00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:14.140
then we have to tax people
who do work more to pay

00:38:14.140 --> 00:38:15.590
for these programs.

00:38:15.590 --> 00:38:21.260
So it raises taxation, raises
the required tax revenues,

00:38:21.260 --> 00:38:23.380
raises the tax
revenues required.

00:38:23.380 --> 00:38:25.290
Because if you're
sitting at home more,

00:38:25.290 --> 00:38:28.020
I've got to make more money
to pay for you to sit at home.

00:38:28.020 --> 00:38:31.220
And we know taxation also
causes deadweight loss.

00:38:31.220 --> 00:38:33.230
So it's a double win.

00:38:33.230 --> 00:38:35.157
I cause you to
stay at home and I

00:38:35.157 --> 00:38:37.615
cause other people to have to
pay more taxes to pay for you

00:38:37.615 --> 00:38:41.630
to sit at home, which causes
them to work less, too.

00:38:41.630 --> 00:38:44.170
There's a second round effect.

00:38:44.170 --> 00:38:48.680
As a result, moral hazard
causes inefficiency in society.

00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:50.090
And that is the trade-off.

00:38:50.090 --> 00:38:52.090
Once again, I told you,
this course is annoying.

00:38:52.090 --> 00:38:53.423
We don't give you right answers.

00:38:53.423 --> 00:38:54.830
We just tell you trade-offs.

00:38:54.830 --> 00:38:59.300
The trade-off here is we need
programs like unemployment

00:38:59.300 --> 00:39:01.133
insurance, because otherwise--

00:39:01.133 --> 00:39:03.050
let's take the case of
unemployment insurance.

00:39:03.050 --> 00:39:04.467
We'll go through
it one more time.

00:39:04.467 --> 00:39:06.710
Imagine there's no government
unemployment insurance,

00:39:06.710 --> 00:39:07.835
and you said, that's great.

00:39:07.835 --> 00:39:10.010
I'll offer private
unemployment insurance.

00:39:10.010 --> 00:39:11.610
Well, that's not going to work.

00:39:11.610 --> 00:39:12.200
Why?

00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:13.610
Because people
know way more than

00:39:13.610 --> 00:39:16.270
you do about whether they're
going to lose their job.

00:39:16.270 --> 00:39:18.370
If you tried to offer
private insurance,

00:39:18.370 --> 00:39:21.690
you'd lose your shirt
because of adverse selection.

00:39:21.690 --> 00:39:24.050
So absent government-provided
unemployment insurance,

00:39:24.050 --> 00:39:25.758
there would be no
unemployment insurance.

00:39:25.758 --> 00:39:26.880
And that would be bad.

00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:28.850
That would mean people would
be subject to a risk that

00:39:28.850 --> 00:39:30.433
would drive their
consumption to zero.

00:39:30.433 --> 00:39:32.677
Remember, most Americans
have no savings.

00:39:32.677 --> 00:39:34.510
That mean Americans
would be subject to risk

00:39:34.510 --> 00:39:37.580
where if they lost their
job, they would starve.

00:39:37.580 --> 00:39:39.570
That's a very bad outcome.

00:39:39.570 --> 00:39:42.380
So it is socially
valuable to insure

00:39:42.380 --> 00:39:44.460
against unemployment risk.

00:39:44.460 --> 00:39:48.240
The private market can't do it
because of adverse selection.

00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:51.660
Therefore, there is a
compelling case for government

00:39:51.660 --> 00:39:53.370
unemployment insurance.

00:39:53.370 --> 00:39:55.595
But with government-provided
unemployment insurance,

00:39:55.595 --> 00:39:57.220
that causes people
to sit at home extra

00:39:57.220 --> 00:39:58.710
and not work as hard.

00:39:58.710 --> 00:40:00.800
And that's the sort
of chain of logic

00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:03.430
which teaches you the trade-off.

00:40:03.430 --> 00:40:06.190
What this says is optimal
social insurance--

00:40:06.190 --> 00:40:07.940
that in these
markets, we're going

00:40:07.940 --> 00:40:12.270
to want some social
insurance, but not too much.

00:40:12.270 --> 00:40:14.210
We're going to want
enough to protect people

00:40:14.210 --> 00:40:16.702
against starving, but
not so much that it

00:40:16.702 --> 00:40:17.910
causes people to sit at home.

00:40:17.910 --> 00:40:19.487
So for example,
if I told you I'm

00:40:19.487 --> 00:40:21.570
going to set up an
unemployment insurance program,

00:40:21.570 --> 00:40:24.170
and the way it's going to
work is if you lose your job,

00:40:24.170 --> 00:40:26.900
I'm going to pay your
entire wage for as long

00:40:26.900 --> 00:40:30.380
as you need until you find
a new job, that would not

00:40:30.380 --> 00:40:32.650
be a good idea.

00:40:32.650 --> 00:40:34.990
That would cause a huge
amount of moral hazard.

00:40:34.990 --> 00:40:38.080
And remember, compare
that program to one

00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:42.340
where I'll pay you 50% of your
wage till you find a new job.

00:40:42.340 --> 00:40:46.183
Well, 50%, going
from 0% to 50%, 0%

00:40:46.183 --> 00:40:48.850
of your wage to 50% of your wage
is a huge consumption smoothing

00:40:48.850 --> 00:40:49.350
benefit.

00:40:49.350 --> 00:40:51.550
You go from starving to
being able to eat decently.

00:40:51.550 --> 00:40:54.640
50% to 100% is an
increase, but not as much.

00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:57.803
But 50% to 100% has a
huge moral hazard effect.

00:40:57.803 --> 00:40:59.720
So you want something
more towards the middle,

00:40:59.720 --> 00:41:02.030
where you're getting people
away from starving, but not

00:41:02.030 --> 00:41:05.450
so much that they don't work.

00:41:05.450 --> 00:41:06.710
So that's the trade-off.

00:41:06.710 --> 00:41:09.480
So let's talk about
that trade in practice.

00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:12.230
Let's talk about the US
Social Security program.

00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:20.900
The Social Security
program in the US--

00:41:20.900 --> 00:41:24.590
Social Security is our biggest
single social insurance program

00:41:24.590 --> 00:41:25.970
in the US.

00:41:25.970 --> 00:41:31.310
Currently, the Social Security
program is about $800 billion

00:41:31.310 --> 00:41:32.420
per year.

00:41:32.420 --> 00:41:33.300
That's real money.

00:41:33.300 --> 00:41:38.640
That's even more than Jeff
Bezos has, $800 billion a year.

00:41:38.640 --> 00:41:41.537
That's more than he's
worth, every year.

00:41:41.537 --> 00:41:42.620
What does this program do?

00:41:42.620 --> 00:41:45.230
What this program
does, in a nutshell,

00:41:45.230 --> 00:41:50.000
is it insures you against
the income loss you're

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:52.790
going to face when you retire.

00:41:52.790 --> 00:41:54.830
When people retire,
they suddenly

00:41:54.830 --> 00:41:58.510
go from having a lot of
income to having no income.

00:41:58.510 --> 00:42:00.260
And basically, the
idea of Social Security

00:42:00.260 --> 00:42:03.060
is to make sure you don't
starve when you're old.

00:42:03.060 --> 00:42:06.090
So the way it works
is you pay a tax.

00:42:06.090 --> 00:42:08.700
And if you ever see a line on
your pay stub that says FICA,

00:42:08.700 --> 00:42:10.200
that's what this is for.

00:42:10.200 --> 00:42:12.400
You pay a FICA tax.

00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:16.563
It is 12.4% of payroll, half
on you, half on your employer.

00:42:16.563 --> 00:42:18.730
But it doesn't matter that
half is on your employer,

00:42:18.730 --> 00:42:20.647
because we learned two
lectures ago it doesn't

00:42:20.647 --> 00:42:22.300
matter who pays the tax.

00:42:22.300 --> 00:42:23.850
It's a 12.4% tax.

00:42:23.850 --> 00:42:27.010
That's what matters on you.

00:42:27.010 --> 00:42:29.500
That money then
provides that when

00:42:29.500 --> 00:42:32.920
you retire, starting at
age 62, you get a check

00:42:32.920 --> 00:42:34.060
from the government.

00:42:34.060 --> 00:42:35.890
And you get a check
from the government

00:42:35.890 --> 00:42:37.288
that lasts until you die.

00:42:37.288 --> 00:42:38.830
The check from the
government you get

00:42:38.830 --> 00:42:41.470
is what's called an "annuity."

00:42:41.470 --> 00:42:42.670
An annuity is a payment.

00:42:42.670 --> 00:42:45.080
Annuities are the opposite
of life insurance.

00:42:45.080 --> 00:42:47.890
Life insurance is money that
your family gets when you die.

00:42:47.890 --> 00:42:51.890
Annuity is a regular payment
you get until you die.

00:42:51.890 --> 00:42:54.500
The way it works, you pay 12
and 1/2 percent of your income

00:42:54.500 --> 00:42:56.750
all the way through your
working life till we turn 62,

00:42:56.750 --> 00:42:59.300
or you can collect it later.

00:42:59.300 --> 00:43:02.870
You then get a payment
for the rest of your life.

00:43:02.870 --> 00:43:07.310
That payment is
typically about half

00:43:07.310 --> 00:43:10.540
of what you made when
you were working,

00:43:10.540 --> 00:43:13.930
but it's very
progressive, in the sense

00:43:13.930 --> 00:43:17.305
that for someone
who's very poor,

00:43:17.305 --> 00:43:19.430
it would probably more than
half of what they made.

00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:21.097
For someone who's
rich, it would be much

00:43:21.097 --> 00:43:22.420
less than half what they made.

00:43:22.420 --> 00:43:23.710
It's a progressive payment.

00:43:23.710 --> 00:43:24.910
Everyone gets it.

00:43:24.910 --> 00:43:26.320
Everyone gets Social Security.

00:43:26.320 --> 00:43:28.570
But how much you get from
it depends on your income.

00:43:28.570 --> 00:43:30.112
The poorer you are,
the more generous

00:43:30.112 --> 00:43:34.260
it is relatively
when you retire.

00:43:34.260 --> 00:43:36.170
Now the-- yeah.

00:43:36.170 --> 00:43:39.402
AUDIENCE: Is it possible as
life expectancies get larger,

00:43:39.402 --> 00:43:42.923
it's going to be harder
to have Social Security

00:43:42.923 --> 00:43:44.090
because if you're going to--

00:43:44.090 --> 00:43:45.440
JONATHAN GRUBER:
That's a huge problem.

00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:47.900
It sounds like you should
definitely be enrolled in 1441.

00:43:47.900 --> 00:43:50.190
That's a whole half a
lecture we spend on that.

00:43:50.190 --> 00:43:52.357
I don't have time to talk
about it here, but clearly

00:43:52.357 --> 00:43:53.510
this is a huge, huge--

00:43:53.510 --> 00:43:55.250
so just to give you
a couple numbers just

00:43:55.250 --> 00:43:56.430
to keep you up at night.

00:43:56.430 --> 00:43:58.430
We all know, we're all
talking about the deficit

00:43:58.430 --> 00:43:59.370
is $500 billion.

00:43:59.370 --> 00:44:00.590
It's a big deal.

00:44:00.590 --> 00:44:04.400
If you ask how much
has America promised

00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:08.960
to pay to our senior citizens
over the foreseeable future

00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:11.060
minus how much we'll
collected taxes,

00:44:11.060 --> 00:44:14.880
we are currently, as a
nation, $75 trillion in debt.

00:44:14.880 --> 00:44:17.880
And it's because of the aging
society and things like that.

00:44:17.880 --> 00:44:19.713
We've got big problems
coming down the road.

00:44:19.713 --> 00:44:21.440
We can talk about
that another time.

00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:23.900
But let's focus on the program
itself at a point in time

00:44:23.900 --> 00:44:26.150
right now.

00:44:26.150 --> 00:44:30.020
So basically, we see here
the moral hazard trade-off.

00:44:30.020 --> 00:44:31.850
On the one hand, we
don't want people

00:44:31.850 --> 00:44:33.230
to starve when they're old.

00:44:33.230 --> 00:44:35.840
On the other hand, if I pay
you once you're retired,

00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:38.180
that could cause you to retire.

00:44:38.180 --> 00:44:40.190
If I say, once
you're retired you're

00:44:40.190 --> 00:44:42.485
going to get a check, 50%
of your wage, you might say,

00:44:42.485 --> 00:44:44.360
50% of the wage isn't
that much, but I really

00:44:44.360 --> 00:44:45.152
don't like working.

00:44:45.152 --> 00:44:48.860
I'd rather just hit the
links at 50% of my wage.

00:44:48.860 --> 00:44:51.710
So that's the trade-off.

00:44:51.710 --> 00:44:54.773
Now, how do we think about
evaluating that trade-off?

00:44:54.773 --> 00:44:56.690
Evaluating that trade-off,
different countries

00:44:56.690 --> 00:44:58.640
think about it differently.

00:44:58.640 --> 00:45:01.580
In the US, we think about
it in what I would say

00:45:01.580 --> 00:45:05.420
is a fairly rational way, which
is let's consider your decision

00:45:05.420 --> 00:45:08.658
to retire at 62 versus 63.

00:45:08.658 --> 00:45:10.200
The way it works in
the United States

00:45:10.200 --> 00:45:15.060
is we say, look, if you work
one year more, since it's

00:45:15.060 --> 00:45:17.797
an annuity, you will get
one less year off payment.

00:45:17.797 --> 00:45:19.380
If you start at one
year later, you're

00:45:19.380 --> 00:45:22.080
going to die the same time,
you get one year less.

00:45:22.080 --> 00:45:24.420
So what we do is we pay
you more every month.

00:45:24.420 --> 00:45:26.520
Indeed, for every
year you delay,

00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:30.190
you get 6.7% more every month,
reflecting the trade-off

00:45:30.190 --> 00:45:33.080
that you're going to get it
for a shorter period of time.

00:45:33.080 --> 00:45:35.650
And that turns out
to be roughly fair.

00:45:35.650 --> 00:45:37.780
Given the expected
life of Americans,

00:45:37.780 --> 00:45:40.270
that's a roughly fair trade-off.

00:45:40.270 --> 00:45:43.310
Every year you delay
gets 6.7% more.

00:45:43.310 --> 00:45:46.540
In Europe, they don't have this.

00:45:46.540 --> 00:45:50.300
So every year delay, you just
get less money before you die.

00:45:50.300 --> 00:45:53.040
So let's take the example
of the Netherlands.

00:45:53.040 --> 00:45:56.730
In the Netherlands,
you can retire at 55

00:45:56.730 --> 00:46:00.760
with a benefit that is
90% of what you made.

00:46:00.760 --> 00:46:04.450
So if you earned $30,000,
you can retire at 55

00:46:04.450 --> 00:46:07.510
with a benefit of $27,000.

00:46:07.510 --> 00:46:11.530
And if you decide
to work instead,

00:46:11.530 --> 00:46:13.310
you just forego that $27,000.

00:46:13.310 --> 00:46:14.980
There's no bump up
of your benefits.

00:46:14.980 --> 00:46:17.938
That's just one less
year of $27,000 you get.

00:46:17.938 --> 00:46:19.980
So what that means, if
you're in the Netherlands,

00:46:19.980 --> 00:46:23.010
your choice is work and
get 30,000 or stay home

00:46:23.010 --> 00:46:25.080
and get 27,000.

00:46:25.080 --> 00:46:28.200
In other words, it's
sort of like a 90% tax.

00:46:28.200 --> 00:46:31.110
Think about it-- by working
relative to staying home,

00:46:31.110 --> 00:46:34.050
I'm only keeping 3,000
of the 30,000 I made.

00:46:34.050 --> 00:46:36.690
It's basically like a 90% tax.

00:46:36.690 --> 00:46:39.180
But that's not all.

00:46:39.180 --> 00:46:41.130
How do they pay
for this program?

00:46:41.130 --> 00:46:41.838
They tax people.

00:46:41.838 --> 00:46:43.380
You can't tax people
who are at home.

00:46:43.380 --> 00:46:45.090
You've got to tax workers.

00:46:45.090 --> 00:46:49.530
So if you work, you also
have to pay a 45% tax

00:46:49.530 --> 00:46:52.710
to pay for this program
and lots of other things.

00:46:52.710 --> 00:46:56.140
45% tax is a high tax
rate for everything.

00:46:56.140 --> 00:47:01.260
What that means is if you
stay at home, you get 27,000.

00:47:01.260 --> 00:47:03.780
If you go to work,
you get 30,000 times

00:47:03.780 --> 00:47:10.120
1.55, or about 18,000.

00:47:10.120 --> 00:47:12.430
That's 1.6, It's 16, 5.

00:47:12.430 --> 00:47:17.710
So your choice is stay at home
and get 27, work and get 16, 5.

00:47:17.710 --> 00:47:18.460
Guess what?

00:47:18.460 --> 00:47:20.410
No one works.

00:47:20.410 --> 00:47:23.812
No one over 55 in the
Netherlands works, like zero.

00:47:23.812 --> 00:47:26.020
And they might work on the
black market and ways they

00:47:26.020 --> 00:47:27.360
don't report to the government.

00:47:27.360 --> 00:47:29.700
But basically, they just sort
of sit around coffee shops

00:47:29.700 --> 00:47:32.640
and spend their
retirement money.

00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:35.280
So here's a case where they've
made a very different decision

00:47:35.280 --> 00:47:37.110
about how to make
this trade-off, which

00:47:37.110 --> 00:47:41.250
is it's a pretty sweet life for
the elderly in the Netherlands,

00:47:41.250 --> 00:47:44.190
but no one's
working over age 55.

00:47:44.190 --> 00:47:46.440
And that's a different way
to resolve this trade-off.

00:47:46.440 --> 00:47:51.270
So basically, this illustrates
different design features

00:47:51.270 --> 00:47:52.255
of the program.

00:47:52.255 --> 00:47:53.880
What makes the
Netherlands program have

00:47:53.880 --> 00:47:57.030
much more moral hazard than the
US is the benefits are higher

00:47:57.030 --> 00:48:00.050
and they don't increase your
benefits if you work more.

00:48:00.050 --> 00:48:03.230
So essentially, these are
little kind of tweaky details

00:48:03.230 --> 00:48:04.980
that turn out to matter
enormously for how

00:48:04.980 --> 00:48:06.957
we think about the program.

00:48:06.957 --> 00:48:08.540
Now, I hope you find
that interesting.

00:48:08.540 --> 00:48:10.100
That was a lot to
put in one lecture.

00:48:10.100 --> 00:48:11.850
Like I said, if you
find this interesting,

00:48:11.850 --> 00:48:14.880
there's the whole third of a
semester in my class 14.41.

00:48:14.880 --> 00:48:15.690
So take that.

00:48:15.690 --> 00:48:18.070
We can learn a
lot more about it.

WEBVTT

00:00:16.412 --> 00:00:17.370
ADAM MARTIN: All right.

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:20.580
So in Monday's
lecture, we talked

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:27.540
about how cells replicate, OK?

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:32.880
And today, I want to talk about
how now an entire organ would

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.380
essentially replicate.

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.540
In this case, it's
not going to divide,

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:42.240
but it's going to regenerate
or renew itself, OK?

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:50.400
And so this involves adult
stem cells and also apoptosis ,

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.580
which you've heard a little bit
about earlier in the course.

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:57.450
And to explain this to you, I'm
going to have basically a model

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:59.250
organ that we'll use.

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.490
And we'll use it for
a couple lectures.

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:07.020
And the model organ is going to
be the lining of the intestine,

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.070
OK?

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:16.470
So the lining of the intestine
is an epithelial tissue.

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.160
And I'll tell you a
little bit about epithelia

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:20.490
in just a minute.

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.220
But you have the
intestinal epithelium.

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.120
And this is the-- these
are the cells that

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.170
are the lining of
the intestine, OK?

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.170
And one of the reasons that
I've chosen this system

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.710
is because the lining
of your intestine

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.150
has pretty remarkable
regenerative capabilities, OK?

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:56.230
So your small intestine renews
about every four to five days,

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.730
OK?

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:01.560
So the vast majority of
your cells in the intestine

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.820
were basically derived in the
last four to five days, OK?

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:11.550
So humans aren't as
cool as some organisms,

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.460
like newts, in that you
can't cut off your arm

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:15.810
and have it grow back.

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.590
But at least we
have the intestine,

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.380
which undergoes a pretty
dramatic regeneration, OK?

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.330
And this is not--

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.790
the intestine is unique
in how rapid this is.

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.990
But you have other tissues that
also exhibit continual renewal,

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.990
like your skin and
your blood cells.

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:35.760
And even the cells
of your that line

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.150
your insides of your lungs,
they do exhibit renewal

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.090
capabilities, OK?

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.090
And so I'm going to use the
intestine as a model system.

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.850
It doesn't mean it doesn't
happen in other tissues.

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.040
But it just happens
that we can--

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.220
we really understand
the intestine system

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.620
maybe a little bit more
than many other systems.

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.170
So I'm going to use
it as an example.

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.490
So in thinking about the
lining of your intestine,

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:06.160
it's important, and it
has important functions.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.130
One important function
of this lining

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:12.630
is it has to absorb
nutrients from food going

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:16.890
through your intestine, OK?

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:26.560
So it exhibits a nutrient
absorption function.

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.660
Now, the lining of your intimate
intestine, much like your skin,

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.740
is also a barrier between
the inside of your body

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:36.410
and the outside world, right?

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:40.080
Because basically, the
inside of your intestine

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.810
is contiguous with the
outside world, right?

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.120
If you open your
mouth, you can get down

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.000
to the inside of
your intestine, OK?

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.145
So it serves also an
important barrier function.

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:01.810
And one point I want to make
about this system right now

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.590
is that the intestinal
epithelium, like many

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:10.690
of your other organs, are
composed of multiple cell

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:12.490
types, OK?

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:17.020
So it also has
multiple cell types.

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:26.690
OK.

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:30.230
So let's now consider the
lining of the intestine.

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:36.140
And the way the intestine
morphologically looks

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:40.850
is that there are a
series of invaginations.

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:44.270
So this is a cross-section
view through the intestine.

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:47.300
So you have to imagine that
this is a cross-section view,

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.460
but that this is a plane.

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:54.260
And it's a plane with a lot
of invaginations in the plane,

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.970
but also protrusions
out of the plane.

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:58.365
And so you have to remember--

00:04:58.365 --> 00:04:59.990
you have to think of
this as a surface.

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:02.600
And then it's wrapped
up into a tube, OK?

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.780
So this is just a very
simple cross-section image

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:09.800
of the intestine, OK?

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:13.430
And the lining of the
intestine is a sheet of cells.

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:21.330
So this lining is composed
of many, many cells.

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:23.270
They're columnar in morphology.

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:32.420
So what I've drawn here
is just a small section

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:33.900
of the intestine.

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:37.160
This would be the
lumen, out here.

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:41.420
This is where the
food is, or the food

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:44.390
going through your
intestine would be.

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:51.860
And then below here, this
is interstitial fluid inside

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:57.530
of your body basically,
interstitial, OK?

00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:58.700
So the food's up here.

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:01.880
The rest of your
body is down here.

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:04.940
And you can see
that there are there

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:06.110
there's a structure to it.

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:08.750
It's not just a flat
surface that's wrapped up,

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:10.970
but there are invaginations.

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:18.640
And the invaginations are known
as intestinal crypts, right?

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:22.180
Much like you would--

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:26.770
if you bury something, like a
body, it would go below ground.

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:31.990
So the crypt is below
the surface of the lumen.

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:37.780
And this these projections,
out here, are known as villi.

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:40.420
So they're the villi
of your gut, OK?

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:47.000
Now, if we consider--

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.770
and this lining is made
up of multiple cell

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:51.750
types, which I've
outlined up here

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:53.100
and which are in your handout.

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:54.870
So you don't have
to write these down.

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:56.340
But this is just
making the point

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:59.380
that there are various
differentiated cell types.

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:02.190
There are enterocytes, which
are the absorptive cells.

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:04.410
These are the cells that
are taking in nutrients

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:07.070
and transporting
them into your body.

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:09.780
There are enteroendocrine
cells that

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:12.780
play an important signaling
function in the gut to regulate

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:15.110
the biology of the gut system.

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:17.970
There are a goblet cells,
which secrete mucus

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:22.230
into the intestine system, which
protects these epithelial cells

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:26.400
from digestive enzymes that
are present in the lumen.

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:29.910
And there is this last
cell type, the paneth cell,

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:33.750
which functions as an important
role in regulating stem cells,

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:36.310
as I'll outline
in just a minute.

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:39.570
So these are all the
differentiated cell types.

00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:41.760
But there's a type
of cell that's

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:44.040
an undifferentiated cell type.

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:46.720
And that's the
intestinal stem cell,

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:50.260
which will be the hero
of today's lecture.

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:50.760
All right.

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:55.740
Now, if we consider just
a small group of cells,

00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:59.040
what these cells look
like is this, OK?

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:03.350
So these are what are
known as epithelial cells.

00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:07.780
And epithelial cells
have certain properties.

00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:11.250
The first is you see that this
end of the epithelial cell

00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:14.070
looks different
from this end, OK?

00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:18.810
And this is called an
apical-basal polarity.

00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:26.050
So much like neurons
have a polarity where

00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:28.830
the on one side of the
neuron there are dendrites

00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:31.720
and on the other side of
the neuron there's an axon,

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:34.530
these cells have another
type of polarity, which is

00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:37.090
called apical-basal polarity.

00:08:37.090 --> 00:08:40.500
So the side facing
the lumen is apical.

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:42.840
So the lumen would be up here.

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:46.590
And the basal side
would be down here, OK?

00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:52.790
So this is basically oriented
along this axis of the tissue,

00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:53.510
OK?

00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:58.920
where apical is on this side,
basal is on this side, OK?

00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:03.990
And these projections from
the individual cell, these

00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:08.040
are called microvilli.

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:10.620
And essentially,
these plasma membrane

00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:13.860
corrugations increase
the surface area

00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:18.840
through which nutrients can be
absorbed into these cells, OK?

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:23.370
Now, one other defining
feature of these cells

00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:26.170
is they have proteins that
protrude from the plasma

00:09:26.170 --> 00:09:26.670
membrane.

00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:35.950
And these are adhesion proteins
that couple the cells together.

00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:37.780
And actually, the cells
are stuck together

00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:40.210
much tighter than I'm
drawing here, such

00:09:40.210 --> 00:09:42.640
that the cells form a
barrier so that things

00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:47.530
can pass unregulated from
the lumen into the body, OK?

00:09:47.530 --> 00:09:50.260
But these proteins,
which I'm drawing

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:52.930
sticking out of the
membranes of the cells,

00:09:52.930 --> 00:09:53.950
are adhesion proteins.

00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:03.220
And these adhesion
proteins simply

00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:06.160
link the cells together
such that they form

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:09.370
a sheet of cells or tissue.

00:10:09.370 --> 00:10:16.490
So they link cells together, OK?

00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:20.830
So these are two of the key
properties of epithelia.

00:10:20.830 --> 00:10:23.200
They have an
apical-basal polarity.

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:26.230
And they also exhibit
cell-to-cell adhesion,

00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:29.560
such as the cells reach out
and connect to each other.

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:32.890
And they basically are glued
together, or Velcroed together

00:10:32.890 --> 00:10:34.990
such that they don't
easily come apart.

00:10:39.170 --> 00:10:39.670
OK.

00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:42.760
Now, in considering this
system, what I'm going to tell

00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:47.890
you is that there is
renewal of this lining.

00:10:47.890 --> 00:10:53.723
And the renewal starts at
the base of the crypts, OK?

00:10:53.723 --> 00:10:55.015
So there's going to be renewal.

00:10:57.610 --> 00:11:05.320
And this cell renewal is at
the base of the crypts, right?

00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:07.020
There are many of
these crypts, right?

00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:08.840
You have you have
like the surface,

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:11.260
but there are many,
many invaginations

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:15.000
that are present in your gut.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:20.890
And the renewal is happening at
the base of these crypts, OK?

00:11:20.890 --> 00:11:23.950
And that's because at
the base of these crypts

00:11:23.950 --> 00:11:30.460
are where a type of cell, known
as intestinal stem cells, lie,

00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:31.600
OK?

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:33.970
So it's at the base
of these crypts

00:11:33.970 --> 00:11:38.470
where there are what are known
as intestinal stem cells.

00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:45.070
And I'm going to abbreviate
these ISCs for this,

00:11:45.070 --> 00:11:47.980
so I don't have to write
out intestinal stem cell

00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:51.490
whenever I tell
you about them, OK?

00:11:51.490 --> 00:11:53.530
Now, that's where
renewal occurs.

00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:57.070
And if you just had more
and more cells getting

00:11:57.070 --> 00:12:00.970
put in the system without
any removal of cells,

00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:03.700
then the organ would get
bigger and bigger, right?

00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:06.490
And so our intestine
more or less

00:12:06.490 --> 00:12:10.490
staying the same size at
this point in our life.

00:12:10.490 --> 00:12:18.130
And so in addition to renewal,
there's also cell death.

00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:21.130
And what happens when
cell death occurs

00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:24.430
is that cells are shed
from the intestinal lining

00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:26.000
into the lumen.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:31.765
So cells are shed
into the lumen.

00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:39.280
And then they just go with
the rest of the crap that's

00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:40.660
in your intestinal lumen.

00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:45.100
And it's eventually
removed from the body, OK?

00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:49.930
So some cells are leaving the
tissue and going into the lumen

00:12:49.930 --> 00:12:54.670
after they've existed for a
few days in the intestine, OK?

00:12:54.670 --> 00:12:58.960
So to have an organ
then the constant size

00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:03.350
renewal has to essentially be
more or less equal to death,

00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:03.850
OK?

00:13:03.850 --> 00:13:07.510
And so you can think of this
as a type of homeostatic state

00:13:07.510 --> 00:13:12.550
for this tissue where, if
renewal equals death, you have

00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:18.580
what is known as tissue
homeostasis, where

00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:21.730
the number of cells in
the system as a whole

00:13:21.730 --> 00:13:25.180
is basically remaining the same,
even though there's constantly

00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:27.740
new cells going
into this system.

00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:29.140
But then the cells are also--

00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:31.530
the older cells are being
removed from the system.

00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:41.230
So what's really
key in this process

00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:43.420
are these intestinal stem cells.

00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:47.200
So I'm first going to
tell you about stem cells.

00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:55.680
And these are what I would
define as adult stem cells, OK?

00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:58.330
So they're stem cells
that are associated

00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:01.000
with a particular organ, OK?

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.770
And I want to
differentiate this right

00:14:02.770 --> 00:14:06.730
now between these
types of stem cells

00:14:06.730 --> 00:14:08.950
and another type of
stem cell that we're

00:14:08.950 --> 00:14:11.530
going to talk about later
in the course, which

00:14:11.530 --> 00:14:13.120
is an embryonic stem cell.

00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:22.150
So adult stem cells--

00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:27.420
these stem cells, like
intestinal stem cells,

00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:34.665
are associated with
a specific organ.

00:14:39.210 --> 00:14:42.420
And they only give
rise to cell types that

00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:45.300
are present in that organ, OK?

00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:50.050
So they're not-- they can't give
rise to any type of cell type.

00:14:50.050 --> 00:14:53.880
Your adult stem cells are really
specific-- organ-specific,

00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:55.200
we'll say.

00:14:55.200 --> 00:15:00.000
In contrast, embryonic
stem cells are--

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.520
these stem cells have
more possibilities.

00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:06.270
They can give rise to
pretty much any cell

00:15:06.270 --> 00:15:09.180
type in an entire organism, OK?

00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:11.280
So you can think of
these adult stem cells

00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:14.790
as being more restricted
in their fates

00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:17.260
than the embryonic stem cells.

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:21.660
And so what adult
stem cells are called

00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:26.190
is they're called multipotent,
because they can give rise

00:15:26.190 --> 00:15:28.630
to multiple
different cell types,

00:15:28.630 --> 00:15:30.690
but not all of the
cell types that are

00:15:30.690 --> 00:15:33.000
present in an organism, right?

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.570
An intestinal stem cell
will not be giving rise

00:15:36.570 --> 00:15:42.490
to a blood cell or other cell
types in other organs, right?

00:15:42.490 --> 00:15:44.880
It's restricted to
just giving rise

00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:47.910
to cells that are
present in that organ.

00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:50.460
In contrast,
embryonic stem cells

00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:56.280
are what are known as
totipotent, or sometimes

00:15:56.280 --> 00:16:00.810
pluripotent, where
this type of cell

00:16:00.810 --> 00:16:04.440
really is capable of making
any type of cell that

00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:08.370
is present in an
adult organism, OK?

00:16:08.370 --> 00:16:11.400
So that's less restricted
than the adult stem cells.

00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:14.100
And we're going to come back
to these embryonic stem cells

00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:16.270
towards the end of the course.

00:16:16.270 --> 00:16:19.710
But for understanding
cancer and also

00:16:19.710 --> 00:16:22.320
tissue homeostasis
in the intestine,

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:24.930
we're really needing to focus
on the adult stem cells.

00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:28.800
OK.

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:32.620
So these adult stem cells
have two key properties.

00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:34.710
The first is what I just said.

00:16:34.710 --> 00:16:35.850
They're multipotent.

00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:43.830
And what multipotent
means is that they

00:16:43.830 --> 00:16:48.510
can give rise to multiple
different cell types.

00:16:48.510 --> 00:16:54.645
So this stem cell gives
rise to multiple cell types.

00:17:00.270 --> 00:17:03.420
And this is associated usually
with a single organ system.

00:17:10.619 --> 00:17:11.119
OK.

00:17:11.119 --> 00:17:14.760
So in the case of the
intestinal stem cell,

00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:18.119
the intestinal stem
cell is multipotent.

00:17:18.119 --> 00:17:20.490
And it can give rise to
many different terminally

00:17:20.490 --> 00:17:22.480
differentiated cells.

00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:25.890
And you can see here I've just
written in example cell types

00:17:25.890 --> 00:17:28.349
that the intestinal
cell could generate.

00:17:28.349 --> 00:17:31.140
It can generate any of the
four different types of cells

00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:35.850
that I introduced to you at
the beginning of the lecture.

00:17:35.850 --> 00:17:38.850
The other key aspect
of this system

00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:41.010
is that, in addition
to generating

00:17:41.010 --> 00:17:43.740
all of these
different cell types,

00:17:43.740 --> 00:17:47.610
the stem cell can
also renew itself, OK?

00:17:47.610 --> 00:17:51.810
So the other key property
is this self-renewal.

00:17:56.230 --> 00:18:05.280
So the intestinal stem
cell also gives rise

00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:10.200
to another intestinal stem cell.

00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:13.260
So it basically
duplicates itself such

00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:16.620
that you still have a
stem cell in the organ.

00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:19.830
And then one of
the daughter cells

00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:23.080
is self-renewed and
remains a stem cell.

00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:26.640
The other daughter cell
can go on to divide

00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:30.780
further and give rise to these
differentiated cell types, OK?

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:39.500
All right.

00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:41.660
So one question
you might be asking

00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:45.860
yourself is, how is it that--

00:18:45.860 --> 00:18:49.160
what regulates
whether or not a cell

00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:52.370
will go on to
differentiate or whether it

00:18:52.370 --> 00:18:56.780
will stay a stem cell?

00:18:56.780 --> 00:18:59.300
And the answer to
this question involves

00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:01.520
communication between
this stem cell

00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:05.480
and other cells in the system.

00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:09.110
And it involves a
special type of cell

00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:11.810
called a stem cell niche cell.

00:19:11.810 --> 00:19:14.900
And so I'm going to tell
you about a model, which

00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:17.210
is the stem cell niche model.

00:19:17.210 --> 00:19:19.445
And what the stem
cell niche model is,

00:19:19.445 --> 00:19:23.870
is that basically there is
a niche or compartment which

00:19:23.870 --> 00:19:28.490
promotes the self-renewal of
cells in that compartment that

00:19:28.490 --> 00:19:30.300
makes them stem cells.

00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:36.890
So the stem cell niche you can
think of as a compartment where

00:19:36.890 --> 00:19:43.070
signals, similar to the types of
signals that we've been talking

00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:46.220
about over the past
four or five lectures,

00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:49.940
regulate the behavior of the
cell to ensure self-renewal

00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:53.420
and to suppress differentiation,
so a compartment

00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:58.625
where signals promote
stem cell renewal.

00:20:09.550 --> 00:20:13.360
I want to ask you one question
before I move on, which

00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:15.970
is, how would you define--

00:20:15.970 --> 00:20:17.980
how would you
determine that there

00:20:17.980 --> 00:20:20.860
is a special type of cell
that gives rise to all

00:20:20.860 --> 00:20:24.280
of the cells in an organ?

00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:29.740
If you were tasked with
finding this and determining

00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:32.650
whether this was true or
not, how might you do it?

00:20:32.650 --> 00:20:35.980
Does anyone have an idea of
what experiment they would do,

00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:40.300
or what criteria they would
have to determine whether or not

00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:41.140
this is a case?

00:20:49.990 --> 00:20:53.140
Let's say I gave
you a cell, right?

00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:54.910
In a dish.

00:20:54.910 --> 00:20:57.850
And I asked you to
tell me whether or not

00:20:57.850 --> 00:21:01.450
you would think this
is a stem cell or not.

00:21:01.450 --> 00:21:03.795
Yes, miles?

00:21:03.795 --> 00:21:09.500
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:10.586
ADAM MARTIN: Mm-hmm.

00:21:10.586 --> 00:21:13.051
AUDIENCE: One cell is
produced by the same cell,

00:21:13.051 --> 00:21:16.995
assuming that it's
not a stem cell

00:21:16.995 --> 00:21:25.637
but if the cell [INAUDIBLE]
it's a stem cell.

00:21:25.637 --> 00:21:26.470
ADAM MARTIN: Mm-hmm.

00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:30.580
So Miles suggested he would like
to take the cell that I just

00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:34.780
gifted him, and let it grow up,
and determine whether it gives

00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:37.000
rise to multiple cell types.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.370
And Miles said that,
if it just gave rise

00:21:39.370 --> 00:21:41.500
to a single cell type,
that would suggest

00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:43.310
that it's not a stem cell.

00:21:43.310 --> 00:21:46.690
But if it gave rise to
multiple cell types,

00:21:46.690 --> 00:21:49.450
then it could be
a stem cell, OK?

00:21:49.450 --> 00:21:53.110
And it's this type
of experiment that--

00:21:53.110 --> 00:21:55.480
this type of experiment
has been done,

00:21:55.480 --> 00:22:00.160
where you can take an
intestine from mice,

00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:02.770
and even you can take
tissue from humans,

00:22:02.770 --> 00:22:05.480
and you can associate
the cells from each other

00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:09.520
so that you're left with
single cells that are separate.

00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:13.030
And you can then use some
type of flow cytometry

00:22:13.030 --> 00:22:14.710
to separate cells.

00:22:14.710 --> 00:22:16.900
And you might be
interested in a cell that

00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:20.260
maybe expresses some marker
that you're interested in.

00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:23.710
And you can separate those
cells and isolate them.

00:22:23.710 --> 00:22:26.530
And then you can take
an individual cell

00:22:26.530 --> 00:22:29.200
and grow it in a dish, OK?

00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:32.840
And this has been done
for intestinal stem cells.

00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:35.590
And if you take an
intestinal stem cell

00:22:35.590 --> 00:22:38.140
and you grow it in a
dish, it can grow up

00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:40.780
and form a bulk of tissue.

00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:44.650
But what's really
remarkable about the result

00:22:44.650 --> 00:22:48.100
of this experiment is
that, from a stem cell,

00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:50.290
you get this massive tissue.

00:22:50.290 --> 00:22:53.380
But it self--organizes into
a structure that very much

00:22:53.380 --> 00:22:59.150
resembles a normal gut, meaning
that there are crypts where

00:22:59.150 --> 00:23:01.740
the stem cells are localized.

00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:03.490
And then if you look
at the different cell

00:23:03.490 --> 00:23:06.580
types in this, what's
known as an organoid,

00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:10.570
you see all of the different
cell types that are normally

00:23:10.570 --> 00:23:12.850
present in the gut, OK?

00:23:12.850 --> 00:23:16.090
And so this is an example
of a type of experiment

00:23:16.090 --> 00:23:19.150
that's done to
show whether or not

00:23:19.150 --> 00:23:22.780
a certain cell has the
capability of functioning

00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:24.190
like a stem cell, OK?

00:23:24.190 --> 00:23:26.080
So if you start
with a stem cell,

00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:30.820
you can regenerate the entire
organ system essentially.

00:23:30.820 --> 00:23:34.360
You might also be familiar
with bone marrow transplants.

00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:39.760
And so if you kill all the
hematopoietic stem cells

00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:42.460
in, let's say, a
mouse, then you can

00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:45.700
transplant in a single
hematopoietic stem cell

00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:46.870
into that system.

00:23:46.870 --> 00:23:52.990
And it will regenerate all the
blood cells in that system, OK?

00:23:52.990 --> 00:23:57.010
So those are just a few examples
of how one might functionally

00:23:57.010 --> 00:23:59.860
define a stem cell in
an experimental setting.

00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:02.980
All right.

00:24:02.980 --> 00:24:06.190
So now, I want to tell you
about the types of signals

00:24:06.190 --> 00:24:09.960
and how these signals are
promoting stem cell renewal,

00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:10.630
OK?

00:24:10.630 --> 00:24:13.720
So in this case, the
niche, stem cell niche

00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:14.920
is going to be right here.

00:24:17.910 --> 00:24:20.020
And the types of
signals involved--

00:24:20.020 --> 00:24:23.440
I'll just draw some cells here.

00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:26.230
One of the types of
cells that's part

00:24:26.230 --> 00:24:29.440
of the niche in the
intestine is the cell type

00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:31.705
that I introduced you
as the paneth cell.

00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:38.230
And these paneth cells localized
to the base of the crypts

00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:41.230
together with the
intestinal stem cells.

00:24:41.230 --> 00:24:44.950
And what paneth cells
do is they send a signal

00:24:44.950 --> 00:24:46.960
to neighboring cells.

00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:49.420
And this signal is a Wnt
signal, which I'll tell you

00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:51.050
about in just a minute.

00:24:51.050 --> 00:24:54.100
And so this is the
intestinal stem cell here.

00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:58.660
And the paneth cell is signaling
to that intestinal stem cell

00:24:58.660 --> 00:25:02.950
through a secreted
ligand known as Wnt.

00:25:02.950 --> 00:25:04.870
So Wnt is a secreted ligand.

00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:17.300
And this signal is what's known
as a juxtacrine signal, which

00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:19.940
just means that the cells
have to be adjacent,

00:25:19.940 --> 00:25:25.430
or juxtaposed, to each other
in order for the sending cell

00:25:25.430 --> 00:25:28.130
to signal to its neighbor, OK?

00:25:28.130 --> 00:25:29.990
So it's not
signaling long range,

00:25:29.990 --> 00:25:33.620
but it's signaling to
a neighboring cell, OK?

00:25:33.620 --> 00:25:36.770
So now, if we think about
this intestinal stem cell,

00:25:36.770 --> 00:25:41.600
one thing intestinal stem
cells do as they divide, right?

00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:44.990
So this intestinal
stem cell could divide.

00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:47.300
Here is a cell in mitosis.

00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:50.210
It rounds up and divides.

00:25:50.210 --> 00:25:51.920
Here, you still have
your paneth cell.

00:25:56.950 --> 00:25:58.960
And then when this
cell divides, then it's

00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:02.200
going to be two cells, OK?

00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:06.940
So now, paneth
cell, another cell.

00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:08.780
Here the two daughter cells.

00:26:08.780 --> 00:26:11.170
Here's the paneth cell.

00:26:11.170 --> 00:26:14.800
The paneth cell is still
secreting this Wnt signal.

00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:17.110
So you have Wnt
getting secreted.

00:26:17.110 --> 00:26:19.330
And it's going to
signal to its neighbor.

00:26:19.330 --> 00:26:21.940
But this cell is starting
to get farther and farther

00:26:21.940 --> 00:26:24.070
away from that signal, right?

00:26:24.070 --> 00:26:26.680
So you can imagine this
is happening right here

00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:28.840
in the tissue,
where this cell is

00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:31.990
at the boundary
of the niche, OK?

00:26:31.990 --> 00:26:34.720
So this cell that gets
pushed out of the niche

00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:44.140
is going to start to
differentiate, OK?

00:26:44.140 --> 00:26:48.130
Because it's no longer
seeing the signal, OK?

00:26:48.130 --> 00:26:50.710
So it's the lack
of the Wnt signal

00:26:50.710 --> 00:26:53.530
which tells cells
basically that they

00:26:53.530 --> 00:26:56.620
should start differentiating
into the various cell

00:26:56.620 --> 00:26:58.160
types of the gut.

00:26:58.160 --> 00:27:00.880
But the cells that are stuck
at the base of the crypt,

00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:05.360
down with the paneth cells, are
still getting the Wnt signal.

00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:12.730
And so they remain an
intestinal stem cell, OK?

00:27:12.730 --> 00:27:15.910
So here is just a diagram
showing you part of that.

00:27:15.910 --> 00:27:19.150
So the niche is down here,
where you have the stem cells.

00:27:19.150 --> 00:27:21.760
The paneth cells would be
some of these blue cells

00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:22.720
at the base.

00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:27.100
But there are also other cells
below the epithelial lining

00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:31.630
known as stromal cells that
are also secreting Wnt.

00:27:31.630 --> 00:27:34.210
And so this
compartment down here

00:27:34.210 --> 00:27:37.720
has high Wnt ligan activity.

00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:42.130
And that tells cells that
remain here to stay stem cells.

00:27:42.130 --> 00:27:43.960
But the cells that
are getting pushed up

00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:47.170
and moving up towards
the lumen, they no longer

00:27:47.170 --> 00:27:48.680
receive this signal.

00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:52.300
And so they are going to
start to differentiate, OK?

00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:56.320
So you can think of this
system as almost a conveyor

00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:59.320
belt. There's a conveyor
belt-like movement of cells

00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:02.610
from the base of the crypt up
towards the tip of the villis,

00:28:02.610 --> 00:28:03.310
OK?

00:28:03.310 --> 00:28:06.610
And when the cells move
away from the niche cells,

00:28:06.610 --> 00:28:09.940
then they no longer have
the self-renewal signal.

00:28:09.940 --> 00:28:12.130
And therefore, they go
on to differentiate.

00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:19.060
OK.

00:28:19.060 --> 00:28:20.510
We'll go back for now.

00:28:20.510 --> 00:28:21.010
All right.

00:28:21.010 --> 00:28:25.150
Now, I want to tell you a little
bit about this signal, Wnt,

00:28:25.150 --> 00:28:28.990
because it's something that's
come up before in the lecture,

00:28:28.990 --> 00:28:30.830
even though you
might not know it.

00:28:30.830 --> 00:28:34.270
So Wnt is a ligand.

00:28:34.270 --> 00:28:37.180
So it functions much
like a growth factor.

00:28:37.180 --> 00:28:40.540
This is a protein that is
secreted from the cell,

00:28:40.540 --> 00:28:43.630
and then binds to
receptors on other cells,

00:28:43.630 --> 00:28:48.010
and induces signaling
events in those cells, OK?

00:28:48.010 --> 00:28:49.780
And Wnt stands for--

00:28:49.780 --> 00:28:54.910
the W stands for wingless, OK?

00:28:54.910 --> 00:28:58.120
So you remember from
earlier in the semester,

00:28:58.120 --> 00:29:04.180
wingless was
identified as a mutant

00:29:04.180 --> 00:29:09.220
that disrupts the formation
of wings in the fly, OK?

00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:14.920
So one of the places where
these genes were discovered

00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:16.330
is in the fly.

00:29:16.330 --> 00:29:23.230
The nt of Wnt comes
from int 1, which

00:29:23.230 --> 00:29:28.540
stands for the integration
of mouse mammary virus 1.

00:29:28.540 --> 00:29:31.000
Sorry, that's a little
bit more of a mouthful.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:34.015
The integration of mouse--

00:29:36.850 --> 00:29:43.460
actually, sorry, mouse
mammary tumor virus 1.

00:29:43.460 --> 00:29:44.920
I forgot the tumor part of it.

00:29:52.590 --> 00:29:53.500
OK.

00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:56.740
So the W in Wnt
is from wingless.

00:29:56.740 --> 00:30:01.060
The nt in Wnt is from int 1, OK?

00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:06.190
And so as you can see, there
are two different systems

00:30:06.190 --> 00:30:09.210
where this type of
gene was discovered.

00:30:09.210 --> 00:30:11.840
They are very disparate
from each other.

00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:16.090
One was in a developmental
mutant, in the fruit fly.

00:30:16.090 --> 00:30:21.070
The other was in a
mouse system, where

00:30:21.070 --> 00:30:24.070
the integration of the
virus caused over-expression

00:30:24.070 --> 00:30:28.420
of Wnt, which caused it
as tumor genesis, OK?

00:30:28.420 --> 00:30:32.200
So these disparate systems
led to the identification

00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:35.350
of this Wnt molecule.

00:30:35.350 --> 00:30:39.310
And this is a defining
member of a signaling pathway

00:30:39.310 --> 00:30:42.170
that regulates
stem cell renewal.

00:30:42.170 --> 00:30:44.800
And I just want to briefly
go through the logic

00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:47.980
of the signaling
pathway, because I want

00:30:47.980 --> 00:30:50.860
you to get a sense that not
all signaling pathways are

00:30:50.860 --> 00:30:52.840
like Ras-MAP kinase,
but there can be

00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:55.450
different regulatory logic, OK?

00:30:55.450 --> 00:30:59.380
So what's the regulatory
logic of this pathway?

00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:11.270
So the regulatory logic
is shown in this cartoon.

00:31:11.270 --> 00:31:13.570
And I'm going to
start with a cell that

00:31:13.570 --> 00:31:15.970
does not see Wnt ligand.

00:31:15.970 --> 00:31:19.270
So that would be the
case on the left here.

00:31:19.270 --> 00:31:20.980
So if there's no Wnt ligand--

00:31:20.980 --> 00:31:24.110
I want you to focus on
what's going on here--

00:31:24.110 --> 00:31:28.420
there's a complex that's present
in the cytoplasm of the cell.

00:31:28.420 --> 00:31:30.310
And what it's doing
is it's destroying

00:31:30.310 --> 00:31:33.700
this beta-catenin protein, OK?

00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:36.880
So what beta-catenin is--

00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:41.590
among other things, it's a
transcriptional coactivator.

00:31:41.590 --> 00:31:43.345
So it's basically a
transcription factor.

00:31:48.580 --> 00:31:52.780
So it works with another protein
to regulate the expression

00:31:52.780 --> 00:31:56.720
of certain genes, OK?

00:31:56.720 --> 00:32:01.180
And in the absence of Wnt,
this beta-catenin transcription

00:32:01.180 --> 00:32:07.090
factor is destroyed and is not
able to get into the nucleus,

00:32:07.090 --> 00:32:09.460
OK?

00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:19.000
So if there's no Wnt, then
beta-catenin is destroyed.

00:32:22.390 --> 00:32:24.310
And it's destroyed
using a system

00:32:24.310 --> 00:32:26.770
that I introduced in
Monday's lecture, which

00:32:26.770 --> 00:32:31.030
is regulated proteolysis
by polyubiquitination, OK?

00:32:31.030 --> 00:32:32.390
So the first real--

00:32:35.050 --> 00:32:42.010
so you have
regulated proteolysis

00:32:42.010 --> 00:32:43.790
by polyubiquitination.

00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:50.500
So the way this
works, as seen here,

00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:56.620
is that beta-catenin is
bound by this complex.

00:32:56.620 --> 00:33:00.250
And there's a kinase that
phosphorylates beta-catenin.

00:33:00.250 --> 00:33:02.680
And then the
phosphorylated beta-catenin

00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:05.410
recruits this E3
ubiquitin ligase, which

00:33:05.410 --> 00:33:08.320
polyubiquitinates it, OK?

00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:10.670
So that leads to the
destruction of beta-catenin

00:33:10.670 --> 00:33:14.230
in the absence of a Wnt signal.

00:33:14.230 --> 00:33:17.020
But when Wnt ligand
is around, this

00:33:17.020 --> 00:33:20.980
leads to the disassembly of
this complex, which is known

00:33:20.980 --> 00:33:23.110
as the destruction complex.

00:33:23.110 --> 00:33:26.410
And that leads to
beta-catenin accumulating.

00:33:26.410 --> 00:33:29.230
And once it accumulates,
it goes into the nucleus

00:33:29.230 --> 00:33:32.710
and starts changing
gene expression, OK?

00:33:32.710 --> 00:33:45.720
So in the presence of Wnt,
beta-catenin is nuclear.

00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:48.640
And that's where it needs to
be, if it's going to regulate

00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:51.550
gene expression, OK?

00:33:51.550 --> 00:33:54.580
So what you see is the
logic of this pathway

00:33:54.580 --> 00:33:57.880
is you have a double
negative, where

00:33:57.880 --> 00:34:03.125
you have a complex, which
is known as the destruction

00:34:03.125 --> 00:34:03.625
complex.

00:34:08.219 --> 00:34:10.780
And it includes this
gene, APC, which we're

00:34:10.780 --> 00:34:12.790
going to talk about on Friday.

00:34:12.790 --> 00:34:15.909
This destruction complex
is inhibiting beta-catenin

00:34:15.909 --> 00:34:16.960
by destroying it.

00:34:21.420 --> 00:34:26.860
And the way that Wnt induces
beta-catenin activation

00:34:26.860 --> 00:34:29.830
is by inhibiting the inhibitor.

00:34:29.830 --> 00:34:33.889
So Wnt inhibits the
destruction complex,

00:34:33.889 --> 00:34:37.150
which then stabilizes
beta-catenin and allows

00:34:37.150 --> 00:34:39.489
it to go to the nucleus, OK?

00:34:39.489 --> 00:34:42.280
So the other piece
of the logic here

00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:48.520
is you have inhibition
of an inhibitor

00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:50.487
to activate beta-catenin.

00:34:55.469 --> 00:34:57.385
Any questions on the pathway?

00:35:04.210 --> 00:35:04.710
OK.

00:35:04.710 --> 00:35:11.040
So now that we have our
intestinal stem cells

00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:16.710
and we have a way, by increasing
Wnt in this compartment,

00:35:16.710 --> 00:35:22.500
to maintain the intestinal stem
cells through self-renewal, now

00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:25.080
we have to talk about
the compensatory

00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:28.260
mechanism of death,
which allows this tissue

00:35:28.260 --> 00:35:29.670
to maintain homeostasis.

00:35:34.930 --> 00:35:35.430
OK.

00:35:35.430 --> 00:35:39.870
So death-- in this case,
death is going to be useful.

00:35:39.870 --> 00:35:45.430
And the process of death
is called apoptosis.

00:35:48.710 --> 00:35:51.600
And apoptosis is
Greek for falling off.

00:36:01.430 --> 00:36:03.510
And that's essentially
what these cells

00:36:03.510 --> 00:36:07.920
are doing, because
the cells, as they

00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:11.280
move from the base of the
crypt up towards the lumen--

00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:12.870
eventually, they're
going to fall off

00:36:12.870 --> 00:36:16.630
into the lumen of the intestine.

00:36:16.630 --> 00:36:19.190
So again, I'll draw.

00:36:19.190 --> 00:36:20.205
Here's a villus.

00:36:20.205 --> 00:36:21.080
This is now a villus.

00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:40.980
And so what happens is,
at the tip of the villus,

00:36:40.980 --> 00:36:45.060
cells are going to be shed from
the lining of the epithelium

00:36:45.060 --> 00:36:46.260
into the lumen.

00:36:46.260 --> 00:36:49.320
The lumen is up here.

00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:50.820
This is the villus.

00:36:50.820 --> 00:36:53.340
And the cells are going
to shed off into the lumen

00:36:53.340 --> 00:36:57.750
and be removed from
the organ system, OK?

00:36:57.750 --> 00:37:06.060
So cells are shed into
the lumen here, OK?

00:37:06.060 --> 00:37:09.420
And this is going to
balance the renewal

00:37:09.420 --> 00:37:17.040
at the base of the crypts
such that there's homeostasis.

00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:19.290
So I just-- the movie
I was showing you

00:37:19.290 --> 00:37:22.590
at the beginning of class
was a movie showing you

00:37:22.590 --> 00:37:25.950
what happens to a cell
undergoing apoptosis.

00:37:25.950 --> 00:37:29.700
So in this case, the cell
is binucleate and unhappy.

00:37:29.700 --> 00:37:34.410
And then you're going to see
that it basically explodes, OK?

00:37:34.410 --> 00:37:36.970
So that's a cell
undergoing apoptosis.

00:37:36.970 --> 00:37:40.950
But you see that there is a
clear change in cell morphology

00:37:40.950 --> 00:37:44.190
and physiology
associated with this.

00:37:44.190 --> 00:37:46.590
And I just want to point out
that this is also something

00:37:46.590 --> 00:37:49.450
that we talked about
earlier in the course.

00:37:49.450 --> 00:37:53.250
And we talked about experiments,
a genetic screen that

00:37:53.250 --> 00:37:56.340
led to the identification
of the pathway that

00:37:56.340 --> 00:37:58.590
regulates apoptosis.

00:37:58.590 --> 00:38:00.840
And that was done
by Robert Horvitz.

00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:05.780
Much of it was done by Robert
Horvitz in his lab here at MIT.

00:38:05.780 --> 00:38:10.680
And for that work, Robert
Horvitz, in addition to

00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:15.210
his colleagues, won
the 2002 Nobel Prize.

00:38:15.210 --> 00:38:17.040
So you'll recall
this is something

00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:20.100
we talked about in the
context of a genetic screen.

00:38:20.100 --> 00:38:21.720
But this is something that's--

00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:25.140
this is what it's doing
in your intestine system.

00:38:25.140 --> 00:38:29.880
It's balancing renewal so
that you have homeostasis.

00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:36.170
So during apoptosis, a cell goes
through a series of changes.

00:38:36.170 --> 00:38:38.490
First-- or what
happens eventually

00:38:38.490 --> 00:38:42.300
is the nucleus becomes
fragmented and chromosomal DNA

00:38:42.300 --> 00:38:43.560
even gets fragmented.

00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:45.600
It gets chopped up.

00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:49.710
And also, the
plasma membrane also

00:38:49.710 --> 00:38:54.420
starts to bleb and fragment
such that it breaks up

00:38:54.420 --> 00:38:58.470
into what are known as
these apoptotic bodies, OK?

00:38:58.470 --> 00:39:01.590
And so you can think of
these apoptotic bodies

00:39:01.590 --> 00:39:06.060
as bite-sized pieces of
cell that neighboring

00:39:06.060 --> 00:39:11.070
phagocytic cells can eat up and
remove them from the body, OK?

00:39:11.070 --> 00:39:13.992
So in this case, the cells
are being shed into the lumen.

00:39:13.992 --> 00:39:15.450
So they don't need
to get eaten up,

00:39:15.450 --> 00:39:18.900
because they're just going to
go out of the digestive tract.

00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:30.310
So there are-- cells
have numerous ways

00:39:30.310 --> 00:39:34.270
to activate this
apoptosis process.

00:39:34.270 --> 00:39:39.070
I'm going to tell you
about two types of signals

00:39:39.070 --> 00:39:44.000
that regulate whether or not
a cell undergoes apoptosis.

00:39:49.990 --> 00:39:53.410
The first is that there can be
a signal that basically tells

00:39:53.410 --> 00:39:58.480
the cell to kill itself, OK?

00:39:58.480 --> 00:40:00.580
So you can think of
this as a kill signal.

00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:07.060
And one type of way to
activate this signal

00:40:07.060 --> 00:40:10.930
is if the DNA is
irreparably damaged.

00:40:10.930 --> 00:40:15.550
So if there is a high
level of DNA damage,

00:40:15.550 --> 00:40:19.870
this induces a signaling
process in the cell.

00:40:19.870 --> 00:40:23.740
And one of the results
of that signal--

00:40:23.740 --> 00:40:26.290
in addition to regulating
the cell cycle,

00:40:26.290 --> 00:40:29.770
if the DNA damage
is great enough,

00:40:29.770 --> 00:40:32.490
it will induce an
apoptotic signal.

00:40:32.490 --> 00:40:37.480
And it will activate the pathway
that the Horvitz lab elucidated

00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:39.940
in the worm, OK?

00:40:39.940 --> 00:40:41.180
So there's a signal.

00:40:41.180 --> 00:40:45.430
And that leads to
apoptosis and death.

00:40:50.110 --> 00:40:54.220
Another type of signal that's
critically important for tissue

00:40:54.220 --> 00:40:57.290
homeostasis and determining
whether or not cells live

00:40:57.290 --> 00:41:01.690
or die is a survival signal.

00:41:01.690 --> 00:41:03.640
So there are cell
survival signals.

00:41:08.950 --> 00:41:13.540
And many of the growth factors,
such as EGF which you've heard

00:41:13.540 --> 00:41:14.410
about--

00:41:14.410 --> 00:41:17.740
in addition to
inducing proliferation,

00:41:17.740 --> 00:41:23.230
these growth factors also
tell the cell not to die, OK?

00:41:23.230 --> 00:41:25.285
So these could be
growth factors.

00:41:30.670 --> 00:41:35.830
And what these cell
survival signals do

00:41:35.830 --> 00:41:37.870
is they repress apoptosis.

00:41:41.890 --> 00:41:45.460
And so you can think
of it where you have

00:41:45.460 --> 00:41:49.030
a cell constantly needs
to be communicated to.

00:41:49.030 --> 00:41:52.660
And it needs to
be told don't die,

00:41:52.660 --> 00:41:55.660
don't die, don't die, don't die.

00:41:55.660 --> 00:41:58.330
And then if you
remove that signal,

00:41:58.330 --> 00:42:00.340
it won't be getting that
information anymore.

00:42:00.340 --> 00:42:03.430
And it can undergo
apoptosis, OK?

00:42:03.430 --> 00:42:06.760
So if we were to
remove this signal,

00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:09.400
you remove the
brakes on apoptosis.

00:42:09.400 --> 00:42:12.520
And the cell will
undergo cell death, OK?

00:42:12.520 --> 00:42:17.350
So this ensures that you
don't have a cell just kind

00:42:17.350 --> 00:42:19.750
of like going on and
doing its own thing,

00:42:19.750 --> 00:42:22.360
because cells, in
order to live, often

00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:25.960
need to have some sort of
signal from another cell that

00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:27.170
tells them to live.

00:42:27.170 --> 00:42:31.090
And so there's some
coordination between cells such

00:42:31.090 --> 00:42:33.400
that you don't have
cells rampantly

00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:34.675
dividing out of control.

00:42:40.670 --> 00:42:42.700
Now, the reason we're
doing this right

00:42:42.700 --> 00:42:45.460
before we talk about
cancer on Friday

00:42:45.460 --> 00:42:48.220
is because everything
that I'm telling you

00:42:48.220 --> 00:42:52.450
is really essential to
understand how a tumor is

00:42:52.450 --> 00:42:55.380
formed in an organ system, OK?

00:42:55.380 --> 00:42:57.970
And I want to end the
lecture by just planting

00:42:57.970 --> 00:43:01.210
a seed of an idea in your
heads before we move on

00:43:01.210 --> 00:43:03.940
to talk about cancer on Friday.

00:43:03.940 --> 00:43:07.390
And I want you to think
about the organization

00:43:07.390 --> 00:43:13.060
of this system, where you have
stem cells undergoing renewal.

00:43:13.060 --> 00:43:17.050
And then the stem cells
are just a small fraction

00:43:17.050 --> 00:43:19.120
of the cells in the system.

00:43:19.120 --> 00:43:21.070
And they're dividing slowly, OK?

00:43:21.070 --> 00:43:22.780
So let's think about
the stem cells.

00:43:25.880 --> 00:43:29.395
The DNA on the stem cells,
these are dividing slowly.

00:43:33.490 --> 00:43:35.230
And because they're
dividing slowly,

00:43:35.230 --> 00:43:37.060
they're not going
to-- their DNA is not

00:43:37.060 --> 00:43:40.330
going to accumulate
as many mutations.

00:43:40.330 --> 00:43:43.060
So there is going to
be fewer mutations.

00:43:46.010 --> 00:43:47.630
But these are the
cells, and this

00:43:47.630 --> 00:43:53.480
is the genomic DNA that is going
to stay with the organ, OK?

00:43:53.480 --> 00:43:57.250
So the stem cells are like
the crown jewels of the organ.

00:43:57.250 --> 00:44:00.950
This is the material the
organ wants to protect,

00:44:00.950 --> 00:44:03.380
because it's what's
going to be lasting

00:44:03.380 --> 00:44:08.060
in the organ the entire
lifetime of the organism, OK?

00:44:08.060 --> 00:44:11.750
So you get slow division
here and self-renewal.

00:44:11.750 --> 00:44:15.260
And this cell will
stay with the organ.

00:44:15.260 --> 00:44:18.200
But then where most of the
mitosis and cell division

00:44:18.200 --> 00:44:20.990
happens and
replication happens, it

00:44:20.990 --> 00:44:25.640
leads to an expansion of
cells that all differentiate.

00:44:25.640 --> 00:44:27.410
And because the cells
all differentiate,

00:44:27.410 --> 00:44:31.580
they will all eventually die and
get removed from the organ, OK?

00:44:31.580 --> 00:44:36.530
And this is termed
transient amplification.

00:44:36.530 --> 00:44:41.270
So when there's transient
amplification of one

00:44:41.270 --> 00:44:44.400
of the daughters
of this stem cell,

00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:46.025
this is where there's
rapid division.

00:44:49.140 --> 00:44:52.180
And where there is rapid
replication and division,

00:44:52.180 --> 00:44:54.580
this is where you can
get the most mutations.

00:44:58.390 --> 00:45:00.910
But from the
standpoint of cancer,

00:45:00.910 --> 00:45:02.800
that doesn't really
matter, right?

00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:05.320
Because in order
to have a tumor,

00:45:05.320 --> 00:45:07.630
the cells have to
stay in the body.

00:45:07.630 --> 00:45:09.490
And so all of these
cells are going

00:45:09.490 --> 00:45:11.740
to undergo programmed
cell death,

00:45:11.740 --> 00:45:14.230
and then be shed into the
lumen of the intestine

00:45:14.230 --> 00:45:18.190
and removed from the
organism entirely, OK?

00:45:18.190 --> 00:45:23.020
And so this is actually
one important way

00:45:23.020 --> 00:45:28.180
that our organs and our bodies
prevent tumors from happening,

00:45:28.180 --> 00:45:32.470
because the cell type that is
going to remain in our body

00:45:32.470 --> 00:45:36.460
is the one that's protected
from accumulating mutations, OK?

00:45:36.460 --> 00:45:38.770
And we'll come back
to this on Friday.

00:45:38.770 --> 00:45:40.660
And so I will see you on Friday.

00:45:40.660 --> 00:45:45.480
And we'll talk about
cancer on Friday.

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.880
IAIN STEWART: OK, so
let me remind you where

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.070
we were before spring break.

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:33.650
So first of all, there's a
posting with the project list.

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:37.100
Feel free to pick a project
as soon as you're ready.

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.930
Send me your choice.

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:40.550
Problem set number 3 due today.

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.580
Problem set number 4
is posted this morning.

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.883
It will be due in two
weeks, plus two days so,

00:00:46.883 --> 00:00:48.800
two weeks from now there's
actually a holiday,

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.700
so it will be due
on that Thursday.

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:56.000
Last time, we were talking about
two-nucleon effective field

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.210
theory.

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.720
So this was a
nonrelativistic field theory.

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.620
Both of these terms here in
the action were the same size.

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:04.910
They were the same relevance.

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.640
And we talked about
that last time.

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.050
So in HQET, it would
just be the first term,

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:15.050
but in this case
of two nucleons,

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:16.890
we actually need the
kinetic term, as well,

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.860
and both of these terms
are equally important.

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.047
And that basically means
that in this type of system

00:01:21.047 --> 00:01:22.880
the time derivatives
and spatial derivatives

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.980
are counted differently.

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:26.960
But you can organize
the field theory

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.240
using equations of motion
so that these are just

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:34.220
local operators with
spatial derivatives.

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.675
So you basically deal with
the time derivatives once

00:01:36.675 --> 00:01:39.050
and for all, and you could
always use equations of motion

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:40.950
to eliminate them there.

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.690
And so you just have really
this one time derivative.

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:46.680
This theory is
particularly simple

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.100
if we neglect the
relativistic corrections,

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.230
and that's because
it's not-- because it's

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:53.330
a nonrelativistic
field theory, we just

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.238
have these bubble diagrams.

00:01:55.238 --> 00:01:56.780
And they're just
contact interaction,

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.120
so they all decouple from
each other, so at N-loop order

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.880
we can just write down
what the loops are.

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.760
We talked about the fact
that, in terms of power

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.160
counting things, where it
could be a little subtle,

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.632
and that was related also
to a power divergence that

00:02:09.632 --> 00:02:11.840
occurs in this diagram, and
we could track that power

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.450
divergence by using
particular schemes that

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.660
gave this extra mu r term, and
I won't repeat all that story.

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.660
But that led us to adding
a finite counterterm

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:25.040
to this bubble diagram to track
the power law divergent term,

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.820
and that allowed us to come up
with a power accounting that

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.580
would take into account systems
where the scattering length is

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.260
large, or in particular,
the scattering length times

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.640
momentum is greater than 1, and
in these two-nucleon systems

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.380
that's exactly the
scenario that we're in.

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.800
So what we then had
was a power counting

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.470
that assigned the
very first operator

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.570
to scale like 1 over
a power of momentum.

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:51.440
So not like 1 over the
power of a large scale,

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.060
but actually 1 over a power of
something small, the momentum

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.710
but we're interested
in studying.

00:02:55.710 --> 00:03:02.120
So it's enhanced in
the power counting

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.230
that we wanted to adopt.

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:04.700
And that meant
basically that you

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.690
had to treat this one coupling,
c 0, nonperturbatively.

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.290
You summed it up to all
orders, so the term here

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:17.090
comes from adding
up all the diagrams

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:22.880
with any number of bubbles, and
that all give this first term.

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.350
And then the rest
of the couplings

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:27.480
are treated perturbatively,
the higher derivative term.

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.060
So a term, c 2, which
comes with grad squared,

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:33.590
and that gives this
extra p squared.

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:36.242
And the numerator here gets
treated perturbatively,

00:03:36.242 --> 00:03:38.450
and there's this term, and
then there's higher terms.

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:40.790
And that's how we could
organize this theory,

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:44.450
and this sums up all
these powers of a times p,

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:47.940
these denominators that
I'm showing you there.

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.360
So what I want to do for
the first part of today

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:54.020
is just really continue with
this effective field theory

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:56.000
and talk about a few
more of its features.

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.950
First I want to start
with symmetries,

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:03.560
and then we'll talk about
something called the deuteron.

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:04.306
Yeah?

00:04:04.306 --> 00:04:07.197
AUDIENCE: I have a question
about the relevance

00:04:07.197 --> 00:04:08.030
of the kinetic term.

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.822
IAIN STEWART: Yeah.

00:04:08.822 --> 00:04:11.180
AUDIENCE: So other than
getting pinch singularity

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.160
in your integrals,
is there, I don't

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.443
know, a more power
counting-friendly kind

00:04:15.443 --> 00:04:16.610
of argument for [INAUDIBLE]?

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:18.589
IAIN STEWART: Yeah, so you
can think about it like--

00:04:18.589 --> 00:04:20.930
really, what we're doing here
is nonrelativistic quantum

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:22.670
mechanics.

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:25.352
And if you think about
nonrelativistic quantum

00:04:25.352 --> 00:04:27.560
mechanics, you think about,
like, the virial theorem.

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.000
You're used to
thinking about the fact

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.740
that kinetic energy
and potential energy

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:32.630
are equally relevant, right?

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:34.340
So from a physics
standpoint, if I

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.530
didn't want to
talk about diagrams

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:39.860
or I just wanted to make a
physics argument for why that

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:43.005
would be the right thing to
do, I could simply tell you,

00:04:43.005 --> 00:04:45.380
I want nonrelativistic quantum
mechanics at lowest order.

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:47.720
This is a system with
two heavy particles,

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:51.230
so that's which the
physics should be.

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:52.827
If you start with
the wrong theory,

00:04:52.827 --> 00:04:54.410
then you run into
problems, and that's

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:56.360
kind of what we
saw if we started

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.640
with an HQET-like reasoning.

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:02.330
Then we see this
pinch singularity,

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:05.303
which is resolved
by the kinetic term.

00:05:05.303 --> 00:05:07.720
AUDIENCE: OK, then, why is it
that nonrelativistic quantum

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:11.783
mechanics has the form
that it does, then?

00:05:11.783 --> 00:05:13.700
IAIN STEWART: Why does
nonrelativistic quantum

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:15.242
mechanics have the
form that it does?

00:05:15.242 --> 00:05:15.780
[CHUCKLES]

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:16.863
AUDIENCE: I know, I just--

00:05:16.863 --> 00:05:18.440
IAIN STEWART: Yeah,
so think about it

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:19.815
from the following
point of view.

00:05:19.815 --> 00:05:25.940
So when we just had this term,
what was the particle doing?

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:29.030
When we just had the partial
t term, it's like a source.

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:31.340
We had a single
source sitting there,

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:34.070
and we were interacting with
it with some light stuff.

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:35.780
That was HQET.

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:38.240
Here we have two
sources, and they have

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:39.500
to interact with each other.

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:41.750
And the problem is
that two sources

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:43.700
interacting with
each other, really,

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:47.360
the kinetic energy
becomes a relevant thing.

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:51.950
It's not-- I mean, it's actually
a little more subtle than that,

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:54.800
if you really want to go
into it in a gauge theory.

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.650
There's sort of situations where
these two heavy sources act

00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:59.480
like two heavy
sources, like HQET,

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:01.490
and there's situations
where they wiggle.

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:02.990
And the situations
where they wiggle

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:05.157
are exactly the things that
the Schrodinger equation

00:06:05.157 --> 00:06:05.870
is giving you.

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:12.440
If you like-- yeah, so
to say it precisely,

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:15.260
the potential between
the two heavy particles,

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.020
for the purposes of
figuring out that potential,

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:20.570
you can treat them
as static, as fixed.

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:23.210
But then, once you
have that potential,

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:25.790
these bubble diagrams
are kind of the way

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:29.420
in which that potential
gets iterated into the thing

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:31.950
that you would get from solving
the Schrodinger equation.

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:33.862
So solving the
Schrodinger equation,

00:06:33.862 --> 00:06:35.570
you're effectively
treating the potential

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:39.410
to all orders in this series,
exactly this bubble series.

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:42.320
And when you solve that you
need to include the kinetic,

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:44.570
this grad squared over
2m, for the same reason

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:49.250
that it's a relevant thing to
include in quantum mechanics.

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:52.280
OK, good.

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:55.400
Good project choice.

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:56.545
I urge you-- no.

00:06:56.545 --> 00:06:58.797
[CHUCKLES]

00:06:58.797 --> 00:07:01.380
OK, so let's talk about some of
the symmetries of this theory,

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:02.883
which are kind of interesting.

00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:12.380
So the first one is that
this theory actually

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:15.696
has a nonrelativistic
conformal invariance.

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:34.005
So what is a nonrelativistic
conformal invariance?

00:07:34.005 --> 00:07:39.720
So this is an extension
of the Galilean group,

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:41.160
rather than the Poincaré group.

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:52.140
So we have the
usual translations.

00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:53.640
We have rotations.

00:07:56.460 --> 00:07:57.960
We don't have Lorentz
boosts, but we

00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:01.740
do Galilean boosts for a
nonrelativistic system,

00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:04.180
like this.

00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:05.310
So what would those be?

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:12.900
So under a Galilean
boost, time is not changed

00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:16.777
and the spatial
coordinates are changed.

00:08:16.777 --> 00:08:18.360
And then there's
additional generators

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:22.770
that you have in a
conformal invariance.

00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:28.800
One is a scale
transformation, one generator.

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:31.110
And the way that the
scale transformation works

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:32.799
is as follows.

00:08:32.799 --> 00:08:35.250
You rescale the coordinates
by some-- let's call

00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:37.230
it e to the s.

00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:43.945
But you have to rescale time
differently, by e to the 2s.

00:08:43.945 --> 00:08:45.570
And the reason that
you have to do that

00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:48.000
is exactly because
these two terms

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.410
should be treated the same.

00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:52.920
So you have to rescale
time twice as much

00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:55.890
as you rescale the spatial
derivatives, if you like,

00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:59.130
so that's what gives
rise to the 2 there.

00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:01.350
And that just goes to the
heart of sort of counting

00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:06.340
time and space differently.

00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:11.670
And then, finally, there
is a conformal generator.

00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:13.560
And there's actually
only one generator

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:15.120
in this nonrelativistic case.

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:29.670
And basically what this
generator corresponds to

00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:36.050
is a shift of inverse time and
then a corresponding change

00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:38.330
to the coordinates.

00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:40.430
And if you take all
these things together,

00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:42.638
it's actually something
called the Schrodinger group.

00:09:48.375 --> 00:09:50.000
And the theory we've
been talking about

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.250
actually has this
nonrelativistic conformal

00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:59.100
symmetry, if a goes to infinity.

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:02.180
So I'm not going to spend a
lot of time talking about this,

00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:07.770
but just to give you some of
the ideas of what is going on.

00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:11.090
If you look back last time at
our solutions for this coupling

00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:13.770
constant, and you take
a goes to infinity,

00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:15.240
that's a perfectly smooth limit.

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:16.400
You can do that.

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:19.280
And then the coupling, c 0 of
mu, has no free parameters.

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:22.430
It's just given
by 4 pi over m mu.

00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:24.440
And that corresponds
to sitting at this--

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:26.300
what I call-- what
we last time saw

00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:28.490
was a fixed point of
the beta function.

00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:31.040
And at that fixed point,
there's enhanced symmetry, which

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:32.180
is this conformal symmetry.

00:10:35.690 --> 00:10:40.940
And basically what you can
show is that, if you scale here

00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:46.380
mu just like it was a momentum--

00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:49.555
so mu goes to e to the s mu--

00:10:49.555 --> 00:10:52.570
then the Lagrangian
is scale-invariant.

00:10:52.570 --> 00:10:55.360
My notation up there
would be minus s.

00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:04.340
OK?

00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:07.610
And that is basically kind of
the same thing as making it

00:11:07.610 --> 00:11:09.200
into a relevant coupling.

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:11.630
Once it's got no
free parameters,

00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:15.620
then you can sort
of see that, if I

00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:19.423
have a certain scaling
that makes the free theory

00:11:19.423 --> 00:11:21.590
Schrodinger-invariant, which
is-- so the Schrodinger

00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:25.850
group is the symmetry group of
the free Schrodinger equation,

00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:27.582
so just this term and this term.

00:11:27.582 --> 00:11:29.540
Then the question is,
what interactions can you

00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:32.540
add that would
preserve that symmetry?

00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:35.360
And I'm just telling you that,
in terms of just the scale

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:38.158
transformation,
you could-- if you

00:11:38.158 --> 00:11:39.950
are able to scale the
coupling in some way,

00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:43.370
in particular to make it a
relevant interaction, then that

00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:45.650
will make it a
scale-invariant theory.

00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:47.750
And so the ability to
scale this coupling

00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:50.810
because you scale
this mu allows it

00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:54.570
to be a scale-invariant theory.

00:11:54.570 --> 00:11:56.870
It's a little harder to
see that it's conformal,

00:11:56.870 --> 00:11:58.810
but you can work that out, too.

00:12:09.170 --> 00:12:11.520
Scale-invariant theories tend
to be conformal-invariant,

00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:14.350
and the same is true of this
nonrelativistic conformal

00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:15.490
invariance.

00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:25.430
So if you sort of
add up the bubbles

00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:28.850
that we were talking
about, then you

00:12:28.850 --> 00:12:35.330
find in general in amplitude,
which is this thing that

00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:38.390
has a square root--

00:12:38.390 --> 00:12:40.310
but if I'm not
particular to what

00:12:40.310 --> 00:12:43.310
frame I'm in now, if I just
write it for a general frame--

00:12:43.310 --> 00:12:45.310
before we write it for
the center of mass frame,

00:12:45.310 --> 00:12:47.210
now let me write it
for a general frame.

00:12:53.432 --> 00:12:54.640
Then it would look like this.

00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:03.790
And that thing
goes like 1 over p,

00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:05.980
so it has-- and again,
e's scale differently

00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:10.300
than p's, so this thing
has the right scaling

00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:11.800
for a scale-invariant amplitude.

00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:19.900
And it turns out,
if you do work out

00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:23.818
the conformal transformation,
it's also conformal-invariant.

00:13:23.818 --> 00:13:25.360
And I'm not going
to go through that,

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:29.080
but I've posted a reference
to show you how it works.

00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:33.340
And basically what this leads
to is a cross-section, which

00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:36.820
is 4 pi over p squared, which
is the scale-invariant version

00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:39.850
of a cross-section, where the
cross-section units are just

00:13:39.850 --> 00:13:44.370
set by p, so there's no
other scale in the problem.

00:13:44.370 --> 00:13:44.870
OK?

00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:46.390
So that's kind of
interesting, and one can make

00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:47.515
some predictions with that.

00:13:58.945 --> 00:14:00.320
This is actually
something that's

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:05.630
also investigated these days,
both from a string theory

00:14:05.630 --> 00:14:07.940
point of view as well as
in cold atoms, so that's

00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:12.450
why conformal symmetries
are always fun to play with.

00:14:19.412 --> 00:14:21.870
There's also another set of
symmetries that this theory has

00:14:21.870 --> 00:14:25.431
in this limit, which
is also interesting.

00:14:28.257 --> 00:14:31.655
And that is, like HQET, there's
an enhanced spin symmetry.

00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:38.150
This time, the
enhanced spin symmetry

00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:40.370
comes about by combining
spin and isospin.

00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:49.780
And this is a symmetry that's
known as Wigner's SU(4)

00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:50.280
symmetry.

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:58.490
So Wigner-- I don't know
how many years ago--

00:14:58.490 --> 00:15:01.040
noticed-- long, long
ago, Wigner noticed

00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:04.040
that nuclei tend to
have a symmetry, which

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:08.270
is a combination of spin and
isospin, into a full SU(4).

00:15:08.270 --> 00:15:09.980
And we can understand
actually partly

00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:13.640
where that comes from this
effective field theory.

00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:16.310
So what is this SU(4)?

00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:20.660
Think of it as just
transforming the nucleon field

00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:23.580
under a way where you could mix
up the spin and the isospin.

00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:28.640
So if sigma is for the spin,
tau is for the isospin,

00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:30.117
then some combined
transformation

00:15:30.117 --> 00:15:31.700
where I can mix up
the mu and nus-- we

00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:33.283
just have some set
of generators where

00:15:33.283 --> 00:15:36.560
I label them by mu and nu.

00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:43.850
Sigma mu here is 1, comma,
sigma vector, tau nu, 1, comma,

00:15:43.850 --> 00:15:45.230
tau vector for the isospin.

00:15:53.830 --> 00:15:56.590
If you just take the 1 from both
of them, that's baryon number,

00:15:56.590 --> 00:16:00.040
and that would turn
the SU(4) into a U(4),

00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:04.150
so you can remove that
generator if you like.

00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:08.050
So there's a U(1), as well,
but the nontrivial part,

00:16:08.050 --> 00:16:11.500
where you take either this
or that or both is an SU(4).

00:16:14.590 --> 00:16:17.380
So we can think about this
symmetry with our theory

00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:18.920
if we write it as follows.

00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:23.380
So take the interaction terms
that we've been talking about

00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:25.255
and write them in a
slightly different basis.

00:16:27.850 --> 00:16:31.030
Just take these
two-to-two scattering

00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:35.290
terms, which had no derivatives.

00:16:35.290 --> 00:16:38.290
And I'll write them in a
slightly different basis.

00:16:38.290 --> 00:16:40.870
Before, we wrote them in
sort of the physical basis,

00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:43.480
where we had 3S1 and 1S0.

00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:45.465
That's what we did last time.

00:16:45.465 --> 00:16:46.840
But there's other
possible bases,

00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:51.850
and I can write them in this
basis, singlet triplet basis.

00:16:51.850 --> 00:16:54.130
And the advantage of this
basis is this thing here

00:16:54.130 --> 00:16:55.630
is just SU(4) symmetric.

00:17:05.970 --> 00:17:09.839
And if you want to write down in
relation to the previous basis,

00:17:09.839 --> 00:17:12.650
you can work that out.

00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:16.265
I'll just tell you what it
would be by writing down

00:17:16.265 --> 00:17:18.390
what the coefficients here
are in terms of the ones

00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:18.973
we had before.

00:17:44.692 --> 00:17:46.150
So if we go back
to the basis where

00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:49.600
we had coefficients for the 3S1
channel and the 1S0 channel,

00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:52.330
then this c 0 s becomes
this combination,

00:17:52.330 --> 00:17:54.220
and c 0 t is this combination.

00:17:56.890 --> 00:18:00.070
Now, in nature-- so one way
you could have SU(4) symmetry

00:18:00.070 --> 00:18:02.150
would just be for the
scattering lengths,

00:18:02.150 --> 00:18:07.990
the physical parameter, c 0
1S0 and c 0 3S1, to be equal.

00:18:07.990 --> 00:18:09.970
But in nature, they're
not equal at all.

00:18:09.970 --> 00:18:12.290
In fact, their scattering
lengths have different signs.

00:18:12.290 --> 00:18:15.860
There's no sense in
which they're equal.

00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:19.043
So what is the sense in
which we have this symmetry?

00:18:19.043 --> 00:18:20.710
The sense in which
we have this symmetry

00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:23.140
is the fact that
if the scattering

00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:28.280
lengths are both infinity, then
both couplings are just this.

00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:31.600
So the fact that the scattering
lengths have different signs

00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:34.643
but are both large makes them
close to this fixed point,

00:18:34.643 --> 00:18:35.935
which then gives this symmetry.

00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:56.970
So because of what I just said
for a goes to infinity, c 0 s,

00:18:56.970 --> 00:18:58.470
which is sort of equal--

00:18:58.470 --> 00:19:02.490
some symmetric combination of
these two that's become equal--

00:19:02.490 --> 00:19:09.240
would just become 4 pi over
m mu, and this is for a 1S0

00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:13.910
and a 3S1, both
going to infinity.

00:19:13.910 --> 00:19:18.120
This goes to minus infinity.

00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:19.620
And then the triplet
one, if we just

00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:21.330
work out what it is
from our formulas

00:19:21.330 --> 00:19:24.857
for those other couplings--

00:20:00.150 --> 00:20:02.370
We can just work
out the combination

00:20:02.370 --> 00:20:04.770
from formulas we had
last time, and we

00:20:04.770 --> 00:20:06.492
see that as the
a's go to infinity,

00:20:06.492 --> 00:20:07.450
this coupling vanishes.

00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:16.700
OK?

00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:19.370
So when we're in the limit
where both of the couplings

00:20:19.370 --> 00:20:21.330
become equal, or if we
use this basis, where

00:20:21.330 --> 00:20:24.410
this coupling becomes 0,
we just have this N dagger

00:20:24.410 --> 00:20:25.600
N squared operator.

00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:26.975
Then we have this
SU(4) symmetry.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.370
One of the problems on
this new problem set

00:20:35.370 --> 00:20:39.060
is to think about to
what degree you still

00:20:39.060 --> 00:20:41.460
have that symmetry when
you think about higher body

00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:43.968
operators, three-body
and four-body.

00:20:43.968 --> 00:20:46.260
And there's actually some
very nice little group theory

00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:49.260
arguments where you can
basically figure out

00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:52.350
to what degree you
have that symmetry

00:20:52.350 --> 00:20:56.752
in the higher-body
operators, and it turns out

00:20:56.752 --> 00:20:57.960
that it's also present there.

00:21:05.310 --> 00:21:11.010
And that is one way of thinking
about why Wigner's symmetries

00:21:11.010 --> 00:21:11.760
exist in nature.

00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:15.990
It's not that we're in any sense
having scattering lengths that

00:21:15.990 --> 00:21:17.670
are similar in
these two channels,

00:21:17.670 --> 00:21:21.240
but since they're both large
we're close to the same--

00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:23.970
we're close to
these fixed points,

00:21:23.970 --> 00:21:25.960
which have this symmetry.

00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:26.460
OK?

00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:28.230
So it's like HQET,
in a sense, where

00:21:28.230 --> 00:21:31.080
we didn't have heavy
quark spin symmetry

00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:33.735
when the masses are finite,
but if the charm mass and the B

00:21:33.735 --> 00:21:35.970
mass are both
infinite, then there's

00:21:35.970 --> 00:21:37.772
this new symmetry that pops up.

00:21:37.772 --> 00:21:38.730
It's kind of like that.

00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:12.170
All right, so rather than
talk about the symmetries

00:22:12.170 --> 00:22:14.838
in any more detail than that,
what I wanted to do is actually

00:22:14.838 --> 00:22:16.880
do something a little
different with this theory.

00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:19.880
So there's lots of things
we could discuss here.

00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:22.370
But the thing I want
to discuss is actually

00:22:22.370 --> 00:22:26.780
treating a bound state
in a field theory.

00:22:26.780 --> 00:22:29.120
This field theory has
a very nice property

00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:31.110
that we can
calculate everything.

00:22:31.110 --> 00:22:32.630
So we can actually
see how you're

00:22:32.630 --> 00:22:36.170
supposed to treat bound states
exactly because we can actually

00:22:36.170 --> 00:22:38.270
just look for the pole
that corresponds to that

00:22:38.270 --> 00:22:39.660
bound state in this theory.

00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:40.910
That's what we're going to do.

00:22:43.868 --> 00:22:45.410
So usually if you
have a bound state,

00:22:45.410 --> 00:22:49.460
it's either something
that's nonperturbative

00:22:49.460 --> 00:22:51.770
that you have trouble
dealing with analytically,

00:22:51.770 --> 00:22:55.820
like in QCD, or Coulombic--
even then, the calculations get

00:22:55.820 --> 00:22:59.130
kind of hairy, although
you can deal with it there.

00:22:59.130 --> 00:23:01.310
But here, the calculations
are very simple,

00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:03.980
so we can really follow all
the steps of properly dealing

00:23:03.980 --> 00:23:06.853
with a bound state.

00:23:06.853 --> 00:23:09.020
And the bound state has
something to do with nature.

00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:10.812
It's a state of nature
called the deuteron.

00:23:14.362 --> 00:23:16.820
So the deuteron is a bound
state of a neutron and a proton.

00:23:22.850 --> 00:23:28.880
It has isospin 0, spin 1,
so it's in this 3S1 state

00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:31.810
that we talked about.

00:23:31.810 --> 00:23:34.570
And when you want to look for
a bound state in field theory,

00:23:34.570 --> 00:23:36.303
what you do--

00:23:36.303 --> 00:23:38.720
you may have heard of this
from the lattice point of view.

00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:41.210
What you do is you write down
some interpolating field that

00:23:41.210 --> 00:23:46.110
has overlap with that state.

00:23:46.110 --> 00:23:48.950
So what would that be for us?

00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:51.860
That would be this
operator that we

00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:56.990
called p i 3S1, which had the
quantum numbers for i equals 0

00:23:56.990 --> 00:23:59.490
and s equals 1.

00:23:59.490 --> 00:24:01.620
And we can build an
interpolating field out

00:24:01.620 --> 00:24:04.230
of our N transpose N.

00:24:04.230 --> 00:24:07.140
And actually, any interpolating
field that we write down here

00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:08.820
is equally good.

00:24:08.820 --> 00:24:10.950
The lattice QCD
people like to tune

00:24:10.950 --> 00:24:13.650
what they write down
in order to improve

00:24:13.650 --> 00:24:15.460
the overlap with the state.

00:24:15.460 --> 00:24:17.520
But for our purposes the
simplest possible thing

00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:19.463
will be enough.

00:24:19.463 --> 00:24:20.880
And then you can
ask the question,

00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:22.380
is the deuteron in the theory?

00:24:31.322 --> 00:24:33.030
And to answer that
question, you can just

00:24:33.030 --> 00:24:36.270
look for the pole that would
correspond to that state.

00:24:36.270 --> 00:24:37.890
And the advantage
of this theory is

00:24:37.890 --> 00:24:42.580
that we can just look for
that pole analytically.

00:24:42.580 --> 00:24:43.480
So let's do that.

00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:50.080
So I'll write down
a Green's function

00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:57.730
for the two-particle
state, which

00:24:57.730 --> 00:25:00.410
is just the time-order product
of two of these interpolating

00:25:00.410 --> 00:25:00.910
fields.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.100
And then ask the
question, if I look

00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:15.810
at that time-order
product, is there

00:25:15.810 --> 00:25:19.020
a pole that would correspond
to this state, i.e.,

00:25:19.020 --> 00:25:25.080
somewhere is there a pole
which would behave as follows?

00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:36.150
Some kind of z factor,
and then, in this case,

00:25:36.150 --> 00:25:38.280
because of the way
we've scaled energies,

00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:40.350
we would just be looking
for a pole that's

00:25:40.350 --> 00:25:42.030
when you're in the energy--

00:25:42.030 --> 00:25:44.400
at some negative energy
corresponding to the binding

00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:46.450
energy of that state.

00:25:46.450 --> 00:25:49.110
So remember that we pulled
out the mass of the nucleon.

00:25:49.110 --> 00:25:50.640
That wasn't in our Lagrangian.

00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:55.470
So really, if you
think about what

00:25:55.470 --> 00:25:58.170
the sort of energy of this
state is, it's two nucleons,

00:25:58.170 --> 00:26:00.413
so it's got the energy
of those two nucleons,

00:26:00.413 --> 00:26:01.830
but then there's
a little bit less

00:26:01.830 --> 00:26:03.540
because it's a bound state.

00:26:03.540 --> 00:26:07.050
And this is the amount
by how much less.

00:26:07.050 --> 00:26:09.870
And so the energy for
the pole is negative.

00:26:09.870 --> 00:26:13.425
E bar is less than 0 because
it's much less than the two

00:26:13.425 --> 00:26:14.400
nucleon mass.

00:26:17.070 --> 00:26:22.150
So this E bar is the
two nuclear center

00:26:22.150 --> 00:26:30.090
of mass energy, which
in the conventions

00:26:30.090 --> 00:26:31.170
we were using last time--

00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:36.990
we had energy E over 2
for each of the nucleons,

00:26:36.990 --> 00:26:40.370
so the sum would be E. There's
the kinetic term, as well.

00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:47.250
So what are the diagrams that
we would consider to do this?

00:26:47.250 --> 00:26:51.020
Well, at lowest order it's just
our friends the bubble sum.

00:26:51.020 --> 00:26:53.210
And in fact, when you
go to higher orders,

00:26:53.210 --> 00:26:55.190
we also had bubbles there.

00:26:55.190 --> 00:26:58.820
So to answer this question,
we insert the field.

00:26:58.820 --> 00:27:00.770
We create two nucleons.

00:27:00.770 --> 00:27:04.100
And then they can interact
with c 0's, and then we

00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:07.890
annihilate them with
our interpolating field.

00:27:07.890 --> 00:27:10.010
So these are just
our c 0 bubbles.

00:27:15.130 --> 00:27:15.630
OK?

00:27:15.630 --> 00:27:17.260
And those are very
easy to compute.

00:27:20.655 --> 00:27:24.380
It's just the geometric series
that we already computed.

00:27:24.380 --> 00:27:27.800
And instead of having two
nucleons in and two nucleons

00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:29.525
out, we just have
this deuteron state in

00:27:29.525 --> 00:27:30.590
and deuteron state out.

00:27:40.820 --> 00:27:41.320
OK?

00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:46.060
So the Green's function
starts with one of these

00:27:46.060 --> 00:27:53.470
and then just iterates into
a geometric series, where

00:27:53.470 --> 00:27:57.725
sigma I could define as
two-particle irreducible c

00:27:57.725 --> 00:28:03.080
0 graphs, so sort of taking
out the c 0 iterations, so

00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:06.513
the sigma 1 that I'm
talking about here

00:28:06.513 --> 00:28:07.930
is just this bubble
all by itself.

00:28:10.498 --> 00:28:12.040
And that's something
that we computed

00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:19.040
before and in these
renormalization schemes

00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:19.670
that we like.

00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:25.040
Just comes out to be this.

00:28:27.700 --> 00:28:30.630
So there's an m out
front, m nucleon.

00:28:30.630 --> 00:28:33.850
It's not-- that's
an m, not a mu.

00:28:33.850 --> 00:28:36.530
And then in terms of this E bar,
it just comes out to be that.

00:28:40.670 --> 00:28:42.890
So you could think of
making a positive energy

00:28:42.890 --> 00:28:49.190
by taking E bar to minus E
bound, which is less than 0.

00:28:49.190 --> 00:28:55.520
And then the square root
would be square root of m E B.

00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:58.940
And it's convenient to
define that to be something,

00:28:58.940 --> 00:29:02.120
so I'll call it
gamma B. So that's

00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:04.460
some quantity greater than 0.

00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:07.690
And with this little
notation, this square root

00:29:07.690 --> 00:29:17.360
of minus E bar, minus i
0 is equal to minus i p.

00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:22.940
And we're looking
for whether that

00:29:22.940 --> 00:29:28.820
would be sort of going over
to this gamma B. Sorry,

00:29:28.820 --> 00:29:33.480
so this is equal to gamma B.

00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:35.400
So gamma B is just
like a momentum

00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:39.440
version of the bound state
energy absorbing the extra i.

00:29:43.770 --> 00:29:44.270
OK?

00:29:44.270 --> 00:29:46.062
This is what it would
have been previously,

00:29:46.062 --> 00:29:51.018
but now it's gamma B.
So we know what G was.

00:29:51.018 --> 00:29:52.310
We already computed it earlier.

00:29:52.310 --> 00:29:59.030
G was just proportional
to 1 over a plus i p.

00:29:59.030 --> 00:30:01.550
And now if I just make
that replacement, which

00:30:01.550 --> 00:30:04.490
is why I wanted to derive that,
because I wanted to just see

00:30:04.490 --> 00:30:08.720
how I would replace the i p, it
becomes 1 over a minus gamma B.

00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:10.830
So gamma B is a
kinematic variable.

00:30:10.830 --> 00:30:12.488
It's like a momentum.

00:30:12.488 --> 00:30:14.030
But it's the right
kinematic variable

00:30:14.030 --> 00:30:16.020
to be talking about
for the bound state.

00:30:16.020 --> 00:30:17.898
It's a positive thing.

00:30:17.898 --> 00:30:19.190
And you can see there's a pole.

00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:32.840
OK?

00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:33.845
So there's the
pole corresponding

00:30:33.845 --> 00:30:35.000
to the deuteron state.

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:40.910
It just corresponds to gamma
equals 1 over a of the 3S1,

00:30:40.910 --> 00:30:49.970
which in nature is like 36
m e V is greater than 0.

00:30:49.970 --> 00:30:52.520
If you looked at the other
channel, the 1S0 channel,

00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:55.110
then the scattering
linked with negative,

00:30:55.110 --> 00:30:57.830
so then both terms would be
negative, and there's no pole.

00:31:08.130 --> 00:31:08.630
OK?

00:31:08.630 --> 00:31:10.280
So for the 3S1 channel,
we have a pole.

00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:11.738
That's the physical
deuteron state.

00:31:11.738 --> 00:31:15.480
For the other channel,
there is no pole.

00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:17.910
And the binding energy that
you would get from this

00:31:17.910 --> 00:31:23.520
is gamma B squared over
m, our conventions,

00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:28.830
which, if you calculate
it, is 1.4 m e V,

00:31:28.830 --> 00:31:30.480
and that's not
ridiculously different

00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:34.350
than the real binding energy
of the deuteron, which was 2.2

00:31:34.350 --> 00:31:36.600
m e V. OK?

00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:41.570
It's not-- it's the
right order of magnitude.

00:31:41.570 --> 00:31:43.010
All right, so
that's the deuteron.

00:31:43.010 --> 00:31:45.218
It exists in this theory,
and we could perturbatively

00:31:45.218 --> 00:31:48.600
correct towards this
correct binding energy.

00:31:51.150 --> 00:31:51.650
OK?

00:31:51.650 --> 00:31:54.320
So this deuteron really
exists in the field theory,

00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:57.260
and that means we can calculate
properties of the deuteron

00:31:57.260 --> 00:31:59.630
with this field theory.

00:31:59.630 --> 00:32:01.520
We can calculate
scattering processes that

00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:03.020
involve this bound
state, and it's

00:32:03.020 --> 00:32:05.870
no more difficult than
doing calculations

00:32:05.870 --> 00:32:08.087
that we would normally
do with free fields.

00:32:11.670 --> 00:32:12.720
And we just have to--

00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:14.730
if we want to do something
with the deuteron,

00:32:14.730 --> 00:32:16.380
we have to go to the right pole.

00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:20.803
That's basically what
it boils down to.

00:32:20.803 --> 00:32:22.720
So in order to show you
really how to do that,

00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:25.570
I'm going to give one
example of calculating

00:32:25.570 --> 00:32:27.550
something nontrivial
that involves a deuteron.

00:32:38.450 --> 00:32:41.675
So we'll calculate a form
factor for the deuteron.

00:32:46.430 --> 00:32:49.380
So this is a nice
example, if you like,

00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:52.910
of really showing you how
to use the LSZ formula,

00:32:52.910 --> 00:32:54.650
which you learned
about it in a very sort

00:32:54.650 --> 00:33:00.380
of abstract way at some point,
how to use it for bound notes.

00:33:00.380 --> 00:33:03.650
Because here we have a bound
state exists in the theory,

00:33:03.650 --> 00:33:06.620
and if we want to derive
properties of that bound state,

00:33:06.620 --> 00:33:11.338
we'd better properly use the LSZ
formula for that bound state.

00:33:11.338 --> 00:33:12.380
Let's see how that works.

00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:18.260
OK, so what we'd
like to do, so we'd

00:33:18.260 --> 00:33:20.360
like to have-- we have
some deuteron state,

00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:22.405
and we'd like to take
the matrix element

00:33:22.405 --> 00:33:23.780
with the
electromagnetic current.

00:33:30.890 --> 00:33:34.130
And if you work out what
possible form factors you can

00:33:34.130 --> 00:33:37.460
have for this matrix element,
there's actually three.

00:33:37.460 --> 00:33:39.650
And I'm not going to
spend much time talking

00:33:39.650 --> 00:33:43.130
about the sort of
different couplings

00:33:43.130 --> 00:33:44.923
with spin and stuff
that correspond

00:33:44.923 --> 00:33:46.340
to these different
cases, but I'll

00:33:46.340 --> 00:33:49.028
list them for you,
at least, provide

00:33:49.028 --> 00:33:50.570
you some additional
references if you

00:33:50.570 --> 00:33:53.220
want to dig deeper into this.

00:33:53.220 --> 00:33:56.225
So there's a magnetic, electric,
and quadrupole form factor.

00:34:05.050 --> 00:34:07.420
The charge of the
deuteron tells us

00:34:07.420 --> 00:34:10.449
that this electric
form factor at 2

00:34:10.449 --> 00:34:12.699
squared equals 0 should be 1.

00:34:12.699 --> 00:34:15.610
The magnetic form factor
is like the magnetic form

00:34:15.610 --> 00:34:21.040
factor for an electron in the
sense that, if you go to q

00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:23.925
squared equals 0, then that's
giving you the magnetic moment.

00:34:23.925 --> 00:34:25.300
But here it's the
magnetic moment

00:34:25.300 --> 00:34:27.287
of the deuteron, not
the magnetic moment

00:34:27.287 --> 00:34:27.954
of the electron.

00:34:31.179 --> 00:34:33.889
That's a nontrivial
number in this case,

00:34:33.889 --> 00:34:39.690
whereas here it's just 1
because charge is conserved.

00:34:39.690 --> 00:34:43.020
And if we wanted to think
about putting electromagnetism

00:34:43.020 --> 00:34:46.222
into the nucleon theory,
which we haven't so far,

00:34:46.222 --> 00:34:47.639
then we would turn
our derivatives

00:34:47.639 --> 00:34:48.870
into covariant derivatives.

00:34:48.870 --> 00:34:51.480
So D mu nucleon--

00:34:54.270 --> 00:34:58.680
we have to write down a
charge matrix that couples--

00:34:58.680 --> 00:35:00.960
that takes into account
the proton has charge

00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:02.070
but the neutron doesn't.

00:35:06.660 --> 00:35:12.570
So this is that charge
matrix for electromagnetism.

00:35:12.570 --> 00:35:13.110
OK?

00:35:13.110 --> 00:35:17.400
So it's not difficult.
So that's easy enough.

00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:20.280
Just change your derivatives
into covariant derivatives

00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:25.200
for both D 0 and D
partial and D vector.

00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:27.150
There's also some
additional operators

00:35:27.150 --> 00:35:30.600
that you have to write down.

00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:34.990
So there's operators,
for example,

00:35:34.990 --> 00:35:37.260
that are just
contact interactions

00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:39.270
with the electric
magnetic fields

00:35:39.270 --> 00:35:47.880
in principle, and the first such
one that shows up, just by way

00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:51.548
of sort of telling you the
range of possibilities,

00:35:51.548 --> 00:35:54.090
would be something like this,
where you just have a sigma dot

00:35:54.090 --> 00:35:57.090
B magnetic field insertion.

00:35:57.090 --> 00:36:03.050
This is the magnetic field
for electromagnetism.

00:36:06.900 --> 00:36:09.300
And so if you want to think
about the type of Feynman

00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:12.630
diagram you'd draw for this,
you'd have four nucleons,

00:36:12.630 --> 00:36:16.760
and then you'd just have a
photon coming out, right?

00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:19.260
And if you want to think about
where that could possibly

00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:27.510
come from, there is one really
easy thing to think about,

00:36:27.510 --> 00:36:30.270
would just be to
have a pion exchange,

00:36:30.270 --> 00:36:31.470
and maybe it's pi minus.

00:36:34.410 --> 00:36:37.260
And the photon couples
to the pi minus

00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:39.630
because it's got
electric charge.

00:36:39.630 --> 00:36:42.000
And when I integrate
out the pion,

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:44.160
then I just get something
that looks like this.

00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:45.540
It could be any exchange.

00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:48.150
It could be a real
minus, or anything

00:36:48.150 --> 00:36:50.464
would give an operator
that looks like that.

00:36:50.464 --> 00:36:51.240
OK?

00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:53.040
So there's additional
contact interactions

00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:57.030
involving electromagnetism,
and you gauge the derivatives.

00:36:57.030 --> 00:36:59.040
Then you can put
electromagnetism

00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:00.847
into the theory.

00:37:00.847 --> 00:37:02.430
It gets a little
more nontrivial then.

00:37:14.842 --> 00:37:16.300
And that's what we
need to do if we

00:37:16.300 --> 00:37:18.010
want to talk about
electromagnetism

00:37:18.010 --> 00:37:21.160
coupling for the deuteron.

00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:24.740
But I'm mostly interested
here in how the LSZ works.

00:37:24.740 --> 00:37:27.400
So what does LSZ say?

00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:33.384
So LSZ says that if I have
this state, p prime, J out,

00:37:33.384 --> 00:37:39.100
J mu electromagnetism, p i n--

00:37:39.100 --> 00:37:44.150
i is like a spin index because
we have a triplet under spin--

00:37:44.150 --> 00:37:46.990
then this is how you
should calculate it.

00:38:06.150 --> 00:38:09.620
So q is like the--

00:38:09.620 --> 00:38:13.280
well, I guess I'm in momentum
space all of a sudden.

00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:16.900
Well, no. q is just
p minus p prime.

00:38:16.900 --> 00:38:20.790
E and E bar are related to
the p and the p prime also.

00:38:20.790 --> 00:38:24.410
And what I do is I have some
z factor out front, which

00:38:24.410 --> 00:38:25.910
is the bound state z factor.

00:38:30.050 --> 00:38:33.140
LSZ tells me to be careful
about that z factor.

00:38:33.140 --> 00:38:35.270
These guys here are just
two-point functions,

00:38:35.270 --> 00:38:38.960
and that's because I have
to truncate the lines.

00:38:43.310 --> 00:38:47.045
This is truncation by
two-point functions,

00:38:47.045 --> 00:38:48.920
but they're two-point
functions for the bound

00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:50.628
state, so two lines.

00:38:50.628 --> 00:38:52.420
And then this is the
three-point functions.

00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:00.530
OK?

00:39:00.530 --> 00:39:06.860
So for the
three-point functions,

00:39:06.860 --> 00:39:09.020
what would the time-order
product be for that?

00:39:15.295 --> 00:39:17.045
It's a time-order
product of three things.

00:39:21.875 --> 00:39:23.750
So the two-point function
we already defined.

00:39:23.750 --> 00:39:25.167
It was just the
time-order product

00:39:25.167 --> 00:39:27.830
of the two deuteron fields.

00:39:27.830 --> 00:39:32.060
And the three-point function has
an additional electromagnetic

00:39:32.060 --> 00:39:39.472
current, which we would
formulate-- you know,

00:39:39.472 --> 00:39:40.930
all the couplings
here are this way

00:39:40.930 --> 00:39:44.367
that I was talking
about over there.

00:39:44.367 --> 00:39:46.700
So in terms of diagrams, which
are easier to think about

00:39:46.700 --> 00:39:50.650
in some ways than
time-order products,

00:39:50.650 --> 00:39:53.620
we have the two-point
function, which,

00:39:53.620 --> 00:39:58.150
if I just define all possible
two-point functions as G--

00:39:58.150 --> 00:40:02.230
and this is the thing that
was our two-particle--

00:40:02.230 --> 00:40:04.480
was our irreducible
c 0 contributions,

00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:08.287
plus iterations of c0's, right?

00:40:08.287 --> 00:40:10.120
Since the c 0 is a
nonperturbative coupling,

00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:14.980
we have to iterate, and
this is what we already

00:40:14.980 --> 00:40:17.740
said you could
define as the summing

00:40:17.740 --> 00:40:20.020
of that geometric series,
and then just define it

00:40:20.020 --> 00:40:22.390
as something which is the
full Green's function in terms

00:40:22.390 --> 00:40:26.140
of this irreducible piece
in the usual sort of way.

00:40:26.140 --> 00:40:29.880
And then, for this
other G, I'll draw

00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:33.880
a blob, which I'll also call G,
but with an additional photon

00:40:33.880 --> 00:40:35.690
hanging out.

00:40:35.690 --> 00:40:38.500
Those are all
three-point functions.

00:40:38.500 --> 00:40:41.680
And in a kind of a
similar notation,

00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:46.330
I can have kind of
an irreducible piece,

00:40:46.330 --> 00:40:50.985
and then I can have
iterations with c 0's.

00:41:07.930 --> 00:41:08.590
Et cetera.

00:41:13.150 --> 00:41:15.280
And if I sum up those
irreducible diagrams,

00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:16.960
I can write the full
Green's function

00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:18.460
in terms of the
irreducible pieces,

00:41:18.460 --> 00:41:21.520
again, in a similar
sort of notation.

00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:25.820
It's just gamma, which
carries the indices,

00:41:25.820 --> 00:41:31.990
and then there's just
a couple of-- now

00:41:31.990 --> 00:41:34.780
there's geometric series on
both sides, so when I sum it

00:41:34.780 --> 00:41:35.470
up I get that.

00:41:41.270 --> 00:41:43.668
OK, so this is giving you
the ingredients that we

00:41:43.668 --> 00:41:44.960
need to plug into this formula.

00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:46.120
We need G inverse.

00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:50.600
This is G. The two-point--

00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:52.780
we need the G mu
i J, which we can

00:41:52.780 --> 00:41:55.170
write in terms of the
irreducible guy, like that.

00:41:55.170 --> 00:41:58.227
Then the last thing we need
is this bound state factor.

00:41:58.227 --> 00:42:01.030
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:01.030 --> 00:42:02.400
IAIN STEWART: Yeah?

00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:03.435
AUDIENCE: That cofactor
has a contribution

00:42:03.435 --> 00:42:04.380
that you just erased?

00:42:06.882 --> 00:42:08.340
IAIN STEWART: Yeah,
what I really--

00:42:08.340 --> 00:42:10.030
I'm kind of using
a shorthand here

00:42:10.030 --> 00:42:12.240
with this t product
for all the diagrams

00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:15.030
that come from what I was
talking about over there.

00:42:15.030 --> 00:42:17.513
Yeah, I kind of wrote it as
an electromagnetic current,

00:42:17.513 --> 00:42:19.680
but really what I mean by
it is sort of all the ways

00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:22.500
that electromagnetism can
appear in the effective theory.

00:42:25.052 --> 00:42:26.760
So you can think of
formulating a current

00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:31.848
in the effective theory by just
sort of looking for one photon,

00:42:31.848 --> 00:42:33.390
lopping it off, and
then writing down

00:42:33.390 --> 00:42:35.730
that operator, all the
operators, and that's really

00:42:35.730 --> 00:42:37.496
what I mean by this J mu.

00:42:43.420 --> 00:42:44.970
Any other questions?

00:42:48.730 --> 00:42:50.900
OK, so what's the
final thing we need,

00:42:50.900 --> 00:42:54.100
which is the bound
state z factor.

00:42:54.100 --> 00:42:59.380
So that's-- let me look back at
this kind of form that we had

00:42:59.380 --> 00:43:08.110
for G. We said it's i z, but now
let's denote the fact that z is

00:43:08.110 --> 00:43:10.660
really the principal
function of E bar,

00:43:10.660 --> 00:43:14.230
and it's really the
residue of the pole.

00:43:14.230 --> 00:43:19.850
And what z is, z that appears
in the formula over there,

00:43:19.850 --> 00:43:23.380
it's z at the pole,
so that's where

00:43:23.380 --> 00:43:29.440
I set E bar equal to minus
B D in the numerator.

00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:31.060
So this is the
residue of the pole.

00:43:41.620 --> 00:43:44.080
And with a little
bit of manipulation,

00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:45.760
we can write that
as the following.

00:43:52.578 --> 00:44:04.680
We can relate it to a
derivative at the pole.

00:44:04.680 --> 00:44:05.180
OK?

00:44:05.180 --> 00:44:08.510
So take the inverse,
take a derivative

00:44:08.510 --> 00:44:10.400
to sort of get just this factor.

00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:11.630
Take an inverse again.

00:44:11.630 --> 00:44:15.470
You can extract off that
residue, killing off

00:44:15.470 --> 00:44:18.120
some other pieces by
going to the pole.

00:44:18.120 --> 00:44:18.620
OK?

00:44:18.620 --> 00:44:20.120
So I won't go through
the derivation

00:44:20.120 --> 00:44:24.020
of that little
manipulation, but it's

00:44:24.020 --> 00:44:26.780
a straightforward consequence.

00:44:26.780 --> 00:44:29.330
And if you put in
kind of the formula

00:44:29.330 --> 00:44:32.952
that we had over here for
G, and if you do that,

00:44:32.952 --> 00:44:34.910
then you can write a
formula in terms of sigma.

00:44:37.730 --> 00:44:40.220
And after that kind of
manipulation, it's--

00:44:45.830 --> 00:44:48.660
again, just some algebra
to show that this is true.

00:44:51.570 --> 00:44:53.320
So now we can put all
the pieces together.

00:44:53.320 --> 00:45:01.201
We have this formula,
we have this formula,

00:45:01.201 --> 00:45:02.310
we have this formula.

00:45:14.890 --> 00:45:18.200
Put them into the
formula up there.

00:45:18.200 --> 00:45:29.260
And what we find is that we can
write the kind of result of it

00:45:29.260 --> 00:45:32.560
using LSZ in a kind
of very compact way,

00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:36.580
just in terms of irreducible
things, c 0 irreducible things.

00:45:41.610 --> 00:45:45.180
And it's not just the
irreducible three-point

00:45:45.180 --> 00:45:45.733
functions.

00:45:45.733 --> 00:45:48.150
There is a contribution from
the two-point function, which

00:45:48.150 --> 00:45:55.230
is in this case D sigma D E bar,
where you take E bar and E bar

00:45:55.230 --> 00:45:58.350
prime, incoming and
outgoing energies, to be

00:45:58.350 --> 00:46:00.540
the right energies for
the bound states, which

00:46:00.540 --> 00:46:03.970
is minus the binding energy.

00:46:03.970 --> 00:46:04.470
OK?

00:46:04.470 --> 00:46:07.860
So this factor came from here.

00:46:07.860 --> 00:46:09.960
There was a sigma
squared in the numerator,

00:46:09.960 --> 00:46:12.210
but when I take the inverse
of two of these guys,

00:46:12.210 --> 00:46:14.002
there's a sigma squared
in the denominator,

00:46:14.002 --> 00:46:15.120
and those canceled.

00:46:15.120 --> 00:46:17.220
The inverse of these guys
also had factors of 1

00:46:17.220 --> 00:46:19.380
plus i c 0 sigma
in the numerator,

00:46:19.380 --> 00:46:21.490
and that canceled
these factors here,

00:46:21.490 --> 00:46:27.550
so the only thing left is the
gamma and the D sigma D E bar.

00:46:27.550 --> 00:46:28.050
OK?

00:46:28.050 --> 00:46:31.270
So that's what LSZ
says in this situation.

00:46:36.390 --> 00:46:39.000
And it's actually important to
take this factor into account.

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:40.560
If you didn't take this
factor into account,

00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:42.330
you wouldn't even
preserve, for example,

00:46:42.330 --> 00:46:45.990
that the charge of
the deuteron is 1.

00:46:45.990 --> 00:46:47.735
It's quite important.

00:46:51.380 --> 00:46:54.850
If you look at this
at lowest order

00:46:54.850 --> 00:46:57.190
and you just look at the
electromagnetic current

00:46:57.190 --> 00:47:04.240
for the electric case, and
you can do that with J 0,

00:47:04.240 --> 00:47:10.930
looking at the D 0, and we can
use our previous calculations

00:47:10.930 --> 00:47:17.260
to figure out what the
two-point function is.

00:47:17.260 --> 00:47:28.210
And when I go to
the pole, it's just

00:47:28.210 --> 00:47:30.280
this factor, where
gamma B would be

00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:35.160
set equal to exactly
the binding energy.

00:47:35.160 --> 00:47:35.660
OK?

00:47:35.660 --> 00:47:42.520
So that's just from
the trivial diagram.

00:47:42.520 --> 00:47:44.200
And then the first
contribution that

00:47:44.200 --> 00:47:49.960
comes into the three-point
function can be calculated.

00:47:49.960 --> 00:47:51.529
It's pretty straightforward.

00:47:55.201 --> 00:47:56.770
It gives a tan
inverse, actually.

00:48:04.460 --> 00:48:08.210
And that just
comes from coupling

00:48:08.210 --> 00:48:12.110
to the electromagnetic proton
that's inside the deuteron.

00:48:12.110 --> 00:48:15.720
So this is the proton, which
has an electromagnetic coupling.

00:48:15.720 --> 00:48:17.814
This is the neutron.

00:48:17.814 --> 00:48:18.314
OK?

00:48:18.314 --> 00:48:20.030
And that gives this formula.

00:48:20.030 --> 00:48:20.900
You take the ratio.

00:48:20.900 --> 00:48:23.150
You get the lowest-order
form factor.

00:48:23.150 --> 00:48:25.940
This is a systematically
provable thing,

00:48:25.940 --> 00:48:29.270
so you can do NLO.

00:48:29.270 --> 00:48:33.020
You can do NNLO, et cetera, OK?

00:48:33.020 --> 00:48:35.848
So we can really calculate
properties of the deuteron

00:48:35.848 --> 00:48:37.640
and check whether they
work experimentally,

00:48:37.640 --> 00:48:40.332
and this works extremely
well experimentally.

00:48:44.110 --> 00:48:46.540
You actually don't
see the violation

00:48:46.540 --> 00:48:51.220
of charge conservation in the
form factor until you do NLO.

00:48:51.220 --> 00:48:53.830
Then you really see that
you need this guy in order

00:48:53.830 --> 00:48:56.412
to make sure that the
charge is conserved.

00:48:59.130 --> 00:49:01.240
There would be some
pieces that would show up

00:49:01.240 --> 00:49:02.948
that would seem like
they were correcting

00:49:02.948 --> 00:49:06.210
the charge, violating
electromagnetism,

00:49:06.210 --> 00:49:08.160
magnetic gauge
variance until you--

00:49:08.160 --> 00:49:11.975
but then when you
put the z factor in,

00:49:11.975 --> 00:49:14.390
the z factor contribution
in, everything is nice.

00:49:23.295 --> 00:49:24.670
And this theory
has actually been

00:49:24.670 --> 00:49:29.560
used to do phenomenology,
so just to give you

00:49:29.560 --> 00:49:30.580
some examples of that.

00:49:34.160 --> 00:49:39.340
So you can do a process
like neutron on proton

00:49:39.340 --> 00:49:41.360
produces a deuteron
and a photon,

00:49:41.360 --> 00:49:44.720
which is something that shows
up in Big Bang nucleosynthesis.

00:49:44.720 --> 00:49:48.088
And it's been
calculated to N 4 LO

00:49:48.088 --> 00:49:49.380
in this effective field theory.

00:49:49.380 --> 00:49:51.490
[CHUCKLES] OK?

00:49:51.490 --> 00:49:53.320
And it provides the
most accurate way

00:49:53.320 --> 00:49:57.380
of determining the process
for Big Bang nucleosynthesis.

00:49:57.380 --> 00:50:01.210
You could reverse it, talk
about deuteron breakup.

00:50:01.210 --> 00:50:06.220
You could do processes with
neutrinos on deuterons.

00:50:06.220 --> 00:50:08.530
So you could have
neutrino-deuteron scattering

00:50:08.530 --> 00:50:11.620
to proton-proton
e minus, which is

00:50:11.620 --> 00:50:15.100
the charge current
process at SNO

00:50:15.100 --> 00:50:17.620
or the neutral current
process at SNO.

00:50:23.997 --> 00:50:26.080
All of these things are
within the realm of things

00:50:26.080 --> 00:50:29.800
that you can talk about in this
effective field theory, OK?

00:50:29.800 --> 00:50:32.890
So it has some uses.

00:50:32.890 --> 00:50:35.065
Let me do one more process.

00:50:39.740 --> 00:50:41.260
So you could look at neutron--

00:50:41.260 --> 00:50:45.185
nucleon-nucleon to
nucleon-nucleon plus an axion.

00:50:49.840 --> 00:50:53.600
And there's sort
of a lesson here.

00:50:53.600 --> 00:50:57.820
So if you look at how the
axion couples to the nucleon,

00:50:57.820 --> 00:51:01.990
it's derivatively
coupled, so you have

00:51:01.990 --> 00:51:03.670
a gradient of the axion field.

00:51:06.370 --> 00:51:07.870
And there's two
possible coupling

00:51:07.870 --> 00:51:09.730
that you can write
down, just to consider

00:51:09.730 --> 00:51:15.100
the sort of lowest dimension
in our power counting.

00:51:15.100 --> 00:51:16.570
And this is a
process that actually

00:51:16.570 --> 00:51:19.030
is important for
bounding axion physics,

00:51:19.030 --> 00:51:26.560
for example, axions in the
sun, to worry about how

00:51:26.560 --> 00:51:29.170
they couple to nucleons.

00:51:29.170 --> 00:51:31.647
And the thing that's
actually important

00:51:31.647 --> 00:51:33.730
is, if you're thinking
about this kind of process,

00:51:33.730 --> 00:51:37.300
you have to decide kinematically
what region are you looking at.

00:51:37.300 --> 00:51:39.940
If you're interested
in bounds from the sun,

00:51:39.940 --> 00:51:42.640
you're interested in a situation
where the energy of the axion

00:51:42.640 --> 00:51:45.790
is of order of the
energy of the nucleons,

00:51:45.790 --> 00:51:47.920
but the momentum of
the axion is much less,

00:51:47.920 --> 00:51:57.520
so I'll call that k axion is
much less than p nucleon, OK?

00:51:57.520 --> 00:51:59.150
So from a power
counting perspective,

00:51:59.150 --> 00:52:01.733
the energies are the same size,
but the momentum of the axion,

00:52:01.733 --> 00:52:03.610
which is a relativistic
particle and is

00:52:03.610 --> 00:52:06.240
comparable to the
energy, is much less

00:52:06.240 --> 00:52:08.860
since the nucleon momentum is
much bigger than its energy.

00:52:08.860 --> 00:52:11.920
Remember that the energy
goes like p squared over m,

00:52:11.920 --> 00:52:14.500
so the momentum are bigger.

00:52:14.500 --> 00:52:17.410
And if that's the situation
that you're in, then when

00:52:17.410 --> 00:52:18.970
you're doing a
Lagrangian like this

00:52:18.970 --> 00:52:21.250
you have to be careful
about implementing something

00:52:21.250 --> 00:52:22.390
like that.

00:52:22.390 --> 00:52:24.370
And the way that
it gets implemented

00:52:24.370 --> 00:52:26.740
is by a multipole
expansion, which

00:52:26.740 --> 00:52:28.330
we'll have an
opportunity to talk

00:52:28.330 --> 00:52:32.170
more about in the near future.

00:52:32.170 --> 00:52:33.910
But basically what
that corresponds to

00:52:33.910 --> 00:52:38.097
is that you've got to
make sure that you're

00:52:38.097 --> 00:52:40.180
sort of exchanging energy
between these operators,

00:52:40.180 --> 00:52:41.740
but not momenta.

00:52:41.740 --> 00:52:43.370
That's what happens
at lowest order.

00:52:43.370 --> 00:52:46.480
So if you make this
expansion in the Lagrangian,

00:52:46.480 --> 00:52:49.780
it corresponds to setting the
spatial components of the axion

00:52:49.780 --> 00:52:52.360
field to 0, OK?

00:52:52.360 --> 00:52:55.210
So this is like
doing an expansion

00:52:55.210 --> 00:52:59.095
around x vector equals 0, the
same thing in position space

00:52:59.095 --> 00:53:02.570
is this expansion here.

00:53:02.570 --> 00:53:13.500
So this is-- implements the
k much less than p expansion.

00:53:19.660 --> 00:53:20.160
OK?

00:53:20.160 --> 00:53:21.920
So that would actually
be the operator

00:53:21.920 --> 00:53:26.060
that you would use to
couple axions to nucleon.

00:53:26.060 --> 00:53:28.070
Now, the interesting
thing about this operator,

00:53:28.070 --> 00:53:30.740
which ties into what we
started talking about today,

00:53:30.740 --> 00:53:33.020
is that once you
take x equals 0,

00:53:33.020 --> 00:53:35.150
the things that
you're left with here

00:53:35.150 --> 00:53:40.080
are related to conserved
charges at the SU(4) symmetry.

00:53:40.080 --> 00:53:49.340
So Q mu nu, which is an integral
over all space of N dagger

00:53:49.340 --> 00:53:54.660
sigma mu tau nu N-- that's
the charge of SU(4).

00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:02.490
And the reason that
it's related to that

00:54:02.490 --> 00:54:05.340
is because, once I
take x equals 0 here,

00:54:05.340 --> 00:54:08.670
once I do the integral d 4 x
of the Lagrangian, the time--

00:54:08.670 --> 00:54:11.050
this still depends on time
but doesn't depend on space,

00:54:11.050 --> 00:54:13.560
so I can move the
d 3 x through, just

00:54:13.560 --> 00:54:17.600
let it act on this,
just let it act on that,

00:54:17.600 --> 00:54:19.874
and then I get Q mu nu.

00:54:19.874 --> 00:54:23.658
Well, Q0j and Q--

00:54:23.658 --> 00:54:28.830
or Qj0 and Qj3,
so this guy here.

00:54:31.400 --> 00:54:31.900
Color.

00:54:37.550 --> 00:54:41.120
Qj3, Qj0.

00:54:41.120 --> 00:54:42.840
This guy here.

00:54:42.840 --> 00:54:43.340
Qj3.

00:54:46.220 --> 00:54:50.540
And that actually has
nontrivial consequences

00:54:50.540 --> 00:54:53.570
because charges, if they're
charges of a symmetry,

00:54:53.570 --> 00:54:56.300
are time-independent.

00:54:56.300 --> 00:55:01.130
So even though in principle
I didn't make any assumptions

00:55:01.130 --> 00:55:05.420
about the time dependence
here, and these operators

00:55:05.420 --> 00:55:13.310
could exchange energy,
if I know that they

00:55:13.310 --> 00:55:16.040
are related to charges of
the effective field theory,

00:55:16.040 --> 00:55:17.820
then charges are conserved.

00:55:17.820 --> 00:55:19.444
There's no time dependence.

00:55:24.550 --> 00:55:31.707
So the charges of the field
theory are time-dependent.

00:55:37.790 --> 00:55:41.420
And what that means then is
that this is time-independent,

00:55:41.420 --> 00:55:44.690
and there's actually
no energy exchange.

00:55:44.690 --> 00:55:47.630
So the axion can only
sort of exchange energy--

00:55:47.630 --> 00:55:52.377
the only way the axion can
couple is with zero energy.

00:55:52.377 --> 00:55:54.710
And since it's derivatively
coupled, it has zero energy,

00:55:54.710 --> 00:55:57.920
it has zero momentum,
and there's no coupling.

00:55:57.920 --> 00:56:03.920
So this limit that we talked
about is a symmetry limit.

00:56:03.920 --> 00:56:07.002
The axion just doesn't couple.

00:56:07.002 --> 00:56:07.502
OK?

00:56:07.502 --> 00:56:10.040
So there we're predicting
something falling

00:56:10.040 --> 00:56:13.270
through kind of the
consequences of symmetry

00:56:13.270 --> 00:56:14.645
on this effective
a field theory.

00:56:14.645 --> 00:56:16.145
We're predicting
something about how

00:56:16.145 --> 00:56:20.090
axions couple to the nucleons.

00:56:20.090 --> 00:56:24.380
So if you look sort of
through the possible processes

00:56:24.380 --> 00:56:34.250
that you could have, you could
have two nucleons in a 3S1

00:56:34.250 --> 00:56:43.440
state try to produce an axion,
and that actually vanishes

00:56:43.440 --> 00:56:46.500
irrespective of the
scattering lengths

00:56:46.500 --> 00:56:50.340
because you're
coupling here to spin,

00:56:50.340 --> 00:56:54.870
and that is always a good charge
of the nonrelativistic theory.

00:56:58.200 --> 00:57:06.300
But there is a way that you
could have the process go,

00:57:06.300 --> 00:57:12.630
where you switch from a
1S0 state to a 3S1 state,

00:57:12.630 --> 00:57:14.820
and this guy vanishes
if the scattering

00:57:14.820 --> 00:57:15.960
lengths go to infinity.

00:57:20.470 --> 00:57:23.297
So if you ignored what I just
said and you ignored this here,

00:57:23.297 --> 00:57:25.380
and you just went ahead
and calculated the Feynman

00:57:25.380 --> 00:57:28.320
diagrams, you would just
find that the amplitude

00:57:28.320 --> 00:57:33.408
to this thing is proportional
to this kind of factor

00:57:33.408 --> 00:57:34.200
that we saw before.

00:57:41.028 --> 00:57:42.820
And since the scattering
lengths are large,

00:57:42.820 --> 00:57:47.600
it's vanishing if the scattering
lengths go to infinity.

00:57:47.600 --> 00:57:48.530
OK?

00:57:48.530 --> 00:57:50.550
So at lowest order,
the effective theory,

00:57:50.550 --> 00:57:53.060
it's suppressed, this process,
and that has implications

00:57:53.060 --> 00:57:54.828
for of course the phenomenology.

00:57:54.828 --> 00:57:56.870
You could also put in
higher-dimension operators,

00:57:56.870 --> 00:57:58.617
like the c 2's,
and then of course

00:57:58.617 --> 00:58:00.200
you can get a
contribution, but that's

00:58:00.200 --> 00:58:01.680
higher order of
the power counting,

00:58:01.680 --> 00:58:03.650
and that affects
how the axion could

00:58:03.650 --> 00:58:05.910
be constrained in the sun.

00:58:05.910 --> 00:58:06.410
OK?

00:58:06.410 --> 00:58:08.660
So that gives you a
little bit of a feeling

00:58:08.660 --> 00:58:11.090
for what you can do with
this effective field theory

00:58:11.090 --> 00:58:13.670
and how you can kind
of exploit symmetry,

00:58:13.670 --> 00:58:16.130
as well as the calculability
of the effective theory

00:58:16.130 --> 00:58:20.760
to make lots of
interesting predictions.

00:58:20.760 --> 00:58:22.020
OK?

00:58:22.020 --> 00:58:23.340
So any questions about that?

00:58:29.800 --> 00:58:31.240
All right.

00:58:31.240 --> 00:58:35.873
So that's all I have to say
about that effective theory.

00:58:35.873 --> 00:58:38.290
So we're now going to move on
to our final effective field

00:58:38.290 --> 00:58:40.100
theory, [SIGHS] to
soft-collinear effective

00:58:40.100 --> 00:58:40.600
theory.

00:58:50.750 --> 00:58:53.210
So what I intend to do with
this part of the course, which

00:58:53.210 --> 00:58:54.960
will take us through
the rest of the year,

00:58:54.960 --> 00:58:58.168
is I'm going to hand out
lecture notes for you to read,

00:58:58.168 --> 00:58:59.210
which I'm going to write.

00:58:59.210 --> 00:59:00.260
[CHUCKLES]

00:59:00.260 --> 00:59:02.940
So I haven't done that yet.

00:59:02.940 --> 00:59:04.515
I'm going to continue to post--

00:59:04.515 --> 00:59:06.140
I mean, I have some
rough copy of them,

00:59:06.140 --> 00:59:08.450
but I'm going to make it
pretty and beautiful for you,

00:59:08.450 --> 00:59:11.480
or more beautiful
than it currently is.

00:59:11.480 --> 00:59:14.120
I'm also going to continue to
post the lecture notes of what

00:59:14.120 --> 00:59:15.620
I present in lecture,
so you'll have

00:59:15.620 --> 00:59:17.510
sort of two versions
that you can read,

00:59:17.510 --> 00:59:20.330
either the LaTeX version
or the handwritten version,

00:59:20.330 --> 00:59:25.230
and depending on your taste you
can look at one or the other.

00:59:25.230 --> 00:59:28.652
So what we'll do today is we'll
just sort of briefly introduce

00:59:28.652 --> 00:59:30.110
ourselves to this
effective theory.

00:59:34.520 --> 00:59:36.890
And by way of introduction
to any effective theory,

00:59:36.890 --> 00:59:39.830
the kind of things that we
should talk about or why--

00:59:39.830 --> 00:59:41.475
so we'll talk about why.

00:59:41.475 --> 00:59:43.850
And then we should talk about
what the degrees of freedom

00:59:43.850 --> 00:59:44.350
are.

00:59:49.070 --> 00:59:50.720
And in this case,
we'll also talk

00:59:50.720 --> 00:59:53.030
about kind of what are
convenient coordinates

00:59:53.030 --> 00:59:56.330
to be using for this
effective theory.

00:59:56.330 --> 01:00:02.460
So that's what we'll
start covering today.

01:00:02.460 --> 01:00:03.255
So what is SCET?

01:00:07.670 --> 01:00:09.050
So it's an effective
field theory

01:00:09.050 --> 01:00:12.570
that you can use
for multiple things.

01:00:12.570 --> 01:00:14.780
One is for energetic hadrons.

01:00:22.550 --> 01:00:24.005
So the energy of
the hadron should

01:00:24.005 --> 01:00:25.880
be something that's a
large scale, which I'll

01:00:25.880 --> 01:00:29.660
call Q, conventional notation.

01:00:29.660 --> 01:00:32.180
And by energetic it
means much more energetic

01:00:32.180 --> 01:00:35.840
than the mass of the hadrons,
which is of order lambda QCD.

01:00:41.720 --> 01:00:44.030
It's also an effective
theory for energetic jets.

01:00:48.230 --> 01:00:52.040
And the situation is in some
ways similar to the hadrons.

01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:56.210
You have a jet energy that's
large, of order some Q,

01:00:56.210 --> 01:00:57.800
and that's much
bigger than the jet

01:00:57.800 --> 01:01:04.970
mass, which is the root squared
of some forward momentum.

01:01:09.240 --> 01:01:11.700
And by the name, you should
also imagine that really

01:01:11.700 --> 01:01:13.635
what it is something
to do with QCD.

01:01:16.285 --> 01:01:23.190
Well, maybe not by the name, but
it is something to do with QCD.

01:01:23.190 --> 01:01:26.280
And it's kind of what you
get if you start with QCD

01:01:26.280 --> 01:01:28.950
and you focus your
attention on a certain set

01:01:28.950 --> 01:01:31.450
of interactions,
which are collinear

01:01:31.450 --> 01:01:33.262
and soft interactions.

01:01:39.163 --> 01:01:41.580
So we've met several different
examples of effective field

01:01:41.580 --> 01:01:42.760
theory so far in the course.

01:01:42.760 --> 01:01:43.927
Some of them were bottom-up.

01:01:43.927 --> 01:01:45.150
Some of them were top-down.

01:01:45.150 --> 01:01:47.220
This is going to be a
top-down effective field

01:01:47.220 --> 01:01:50.100
theory, just like HQET was
a top-down effective field

01:01:50.100 --> 01:01:50.938
theory.

01:01:50.938 --> 01:01:52.980
So we'll be able to start
with the QCD Lagrangian

01:01:52.980 --> 01:01:55.778
and derive this theory
by taking certain limits,

01:01:55.778 --> 01:01:56.820
and that's what we'll do.

01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:06.640
So why study this?

01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:08.120
We'll come to that in a bit.

01:02:08.120 --> 01:02:09.663
But what are the
kind of features

01:02:09.663 --> 01:02:11.830
of this from an effective
field theory point of view

01:02:11.830 --> 01:02:13.349
that make it interesting?

01:02:17.181 --> 01:02:22.640
Well, we'll talk about the
answer to both those questions.

01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:29.160
So first, why study this?

01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:32.600
What's this effective
theory good for?

01:02:32.600 --> 01:02:35.320
So one thing that's good for
is understanding factorization.

01:02:38.680 --> 01:02:40.240
And if you think
about what we're

01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:42.430
doing when we probe for
short-distance physics

01:02:42.430 --> 01:02:46.570
at the LHC, we're probing
for short-distance physics

01:02:46.570 --> 01:02:48.580
by colliding things
at high energy.

01:02:55.390 --> 01:03:00.030
So we're carrying
out hard collisions,

01:03:00.030 --> 01:03:03.987
energetic collisions
of particles.

01:03:03.987 --> 01:03:05.820
So the fact that this
effective field theory

01:03:05.820 --> 01:03:09.360
deals with energetic
particles may ring a bell

01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:11.520
as it being something
useful for understanding

01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:12.510
short-distance physics.

01:03:22.217 --> 01:03:24.300
And so what this effective
theory allows you to do

01:03:24.300 --> 01:03:26.190
is disentangle the
short-distance physics

01:03:26.190 --> 01:03:29.610
that you're interested in from
the longer-distance physics

01:03:29.610 --> 01:03:32.220
that's associated to binding
together into hadrons

01:03:32.220 --> 01:03:34.950
or producing these
energetic jets.

01:03:34.950 --> 01:03:37.350
So it's really disentangling
the long- and short-distance

01:03:37.350 --> 01:03:40.290
physics in the standard
model, or the standard model

01:03:40.290 --> 01:03:42.360
plus new physics.

01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:43.980
And basically what
that amounts to is

01:03:43.980 --> 01:03:46.950
disentangling long- and
short-distance physics in QCD.

01:04:01.390 --> 01:04:03.460
So let me write it this way.

01:04:03.460 --> 01:04:06.010
Disentangling the physics
of QCD with addition

01:04:06.010 --> 01:04:07.675
of electroweak or BSM physics.

01:04:11.498 --> 01:04:13.585
It requires a
separation of scales.

01:04:16.120 --> 01:04:20.340
We have to decide what's short
distance, what's long distance.

01:04:20.340 --> 01:04:22.570
If we're interested in
a process like the LHC,

01:04:22.570 --> 01:04:24.220
where we're colliding
together hadrons,

01:04:24.220 --> 01:04:28.690
then that's of course
absolutely necessary

01:04:28.690 --> 01:04:30.790
because the hadrons are
long-distance things,

01:04:30.790 --> 01:04:33.590
and we're interested in
short-distance physics,

01:04:33.590 --> 01:04:37.030
and we can do that with SCET,
so that's perhaps the biggest

01:04:37.030 --> 01:04:38.100
motivation for us today.

01:04:48.090 --> 01:04:50.150
When we make hard
collisions, these jets

01:04:50.150 --> 01:04:52.790
and energetic hadrons
are very common.

01:04:52.790 --> 01:04:56.690
They're the most common
things that are produced.

01:04:56.690 --> 01:04:58.370
And from a physics
point of view,

01:04:58.370 --> 01:05:00.650
that means that there's many,
many different processes

01:05:00.650 --> 01:05:03.067
that you can actually use this
effective field theory for,

01:05:03.067 --> 01:05:05.750
and that's one of the
reasons it's popular.

01:05:05.750 --> 01:05:08.280
So I want to give
you some examples.

01:05:14.430 --> 01:05:16.140
You could do deep
inelastic scattering.

01:05:16.140 --> 01:05:18.300
In this effective theory,
deep inelastic scattering

01:05:18.300 --> 01:05:22.440
involves a hard collision.

01:05:22.440 --> 01:05:25.710
And even classic textbook
deep inelastic scattering

01:05:25.710 --> 01:05:28.300
is made very much simpler by
this effective field theory,

01:05:28.300 --> 01:05:31.860
and we'll show you that with
one of our examples later on.

01:05:35.970 --> 01:05:40.320
You could do Drell-Yan with
either protons and antiprotons

01:05:40.320 --> 01:05:42.570
or protons and protons.

01:05:42.570 --> 01:05:46.140
You could do Higgs
production, and people

01:05:46.140 --> 01:05:49.080
use this effective field theory
to study Higgs production

01:05:49.080 --> 01:05:51.120
at the LHC.

01:05:51.120 --> 01:05:54.390
You could do, by way of trying
to make the examples more

01:05:54.390 --> 01:05:57.060
varied, e plus e minus to jets.

01:05:57.060 --> 01:06:00.255
This is another thing that the
effective theory is used for.

01:06:00.255 --> 01:06:04.110
You could do quarkonium
physics, e plus or minus,

01:06:04.110 --> 01:06:07.770
producing a J psi
and an X. Here,

01:06:07.770 --> 01:06:09.360
you need a combination
if the J psi

01:06:09.360 --> 01:06:13.110
is produced at large energy of
kind of a nonrelativistic QCD

01:06:13.110 --> 01:06:16.800
for this cc-bar
bound state, as well

01:06:16.800 --> 01:06:21.055
as an SCT for the fact that
it's an energetic state.

01:06:21.055 --> 01:06:22.680
So this would be
actually a combination

01:06:22.680 --> 01:06:25.200
of two different
effective field theories.

01:06:25.200 --> 01:06:30.348
People use it for thinking
about jet substructure.

01:06:30.348 --> 01:06:31.890
So all sorts of
things that you might

01:06:31.890 --> 01:06:33.750
be interested in and
thinking about having

01:06:33.750 --> 01:06:37.385
to do with hard scattering.

01:06:37.385 --> 01:06:38.760
There's also
another way that you

01:06:38.760 --> 01:06:41.250
could get energetic
particles, even

01:06:41.250 --> 01:06:43.075
if you don't force
them to be energetic,

01:06:43.075 --> 01:06:45.325
and that is if you had a
very heavy particle decaying.

01:06:49.390 --> 01:06:53.340
So if you had a B meson decaying
and it decayed to light stuff,

01:06:53.340 --> 01:06:56.710
this would also be the right
effective theory for that.

01:06:56.710 --> 01:06:59.790
So for example, in the
process B to s gamma,

01:06:59.790 --> 01:07:03.060
this effective
theory plays a role,

01:07:03.060 --> 01:07:06.000
in the process B to D pi,
where the pion comes out very

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:09.600
energetic, or B
to pi pi, which is

01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:12.305
something very interesting
for studying CP violation.

01:07:12.305 --> 01:07:13.680
You can use this
effective theory

01:07:13.680 --> 01:07:16.230
to understand the short-
and long-distance physics

01:07:16.230 --> 01:07:18.670
of those processes, as well.

01:07:18.670 --> 01:07:19.170
OK?

01:07:19.170 --> 01:07:21.840
And this is coming about
because this B meson is heavy.

01:07:24.780 --> 01:07:27.530
So that's the sort
of range of examples,

01:07:27.530 --> 01:07:29.618
and it's not really
complete in any sense.

01:07:29.618 --> 01:07:31.160
There's just lots
of different things

01:07:31.160 --> 01:07:33.465
you can study with this theory.

01:07:59.910 --> 01:08:01.774
So this I already said,
but let me write it.

01:08:06.022 --> 01:08:09.793
I sort of alluded to
separating perturbative physics

01:08:09.793 --> 01:08:15.320
at short distances from
the nonperturbative physics

01:08:15.320 --> 01:08:16.520
at long distances.

01:08:21.937 --> 01:08:23.979
And the nonperturbative
physics, if you're lucky,

01:08:23.979 --> 01:08:26.220
may be only encoded in
parton distribution functions

01:08:26.220 --> 01:08:29.198
or something if you're
doing a p-p collision,

01:08:29.198 --> 01:08:31.740
and you'd like to separate that
from shorter-distance physics

01:08:31.740 --> 01:08:33.069
that you could calculate
perturbatively,

01:08:33.069 --> 01:08:34.402
and this is a way of doing that.

01:08:37.090 --> 01:08:39.990
And then there's a
renormalization group

01:08:39.990 --> 01:08:43.800
in this effective theory, and
that renormalization group

01:08:43.800 --> 01:08:47.069
actually allows you to
do something cool, too,

01:08:47.069 --> 01:08:49.080
and that is that you
can sum up something

01:08:49.080 --> 01:08:54.899
called Sudakov logarithms,
which are algorithms

01:08:54.899 --> 01:08:59.850
that appear in our canonical way
as alpha s times a logarithm.

01:08:59.850 --> 01:09:03.055
But instead of one logarithm,
you actually get two.

01:09:03.055 --> 01:09:05.430
And so the renormalization
group in this effective theory

01:09:05.430 --> 01:09:10.330
will allow you to handle
those Sudakov logarithms.

01:09:10.330 --> 01:09:10.830
OK?

01:09:10.830 --> 01:09:12.540
So that's some set of things.

01:09:16.660 --> 01:09:19.210
What are we going to have to
do that we haven't done before?

01:09:19.210 --> 01:09:21.430
What are the kind
of new ingredients

01:09:21.430 --> 01:09:23.529
that we're going to run into?

01:09:23.529 --> 01:09:30.069
So sort of a prelude
to things to come,

01:09:30.069 --> 01:09:31.649
or another way of
saying what makes

01:09:31.649 --> 01:09:35.710
SCET different from
the effective theories

01:09:35.710 --> 01:09:36.700
we've seen so far.

01:09:48.430 --> 01:09:51.340
Let's have a little
list for that, as well.

01:09:51.340 --> 01:09:54.810
So perhaps the most
interesting one

01:09:54.810 --> 01:09:59.250
is that we are going to
have more than one field

01:09:59.250 --> 01:10:00.970
for each degree of freedom.

01:10:05.200 --> 01:10:07.590
So we're going to have
more than one field--

01:10:07.590 --> 01:10:09.570
that's not quite the
right way of saying it.

01:10:09.570 --> 01:10:11.195
We're going to have
more than one field

01:10:11.195 --> 01:10:12.195
for the same particle.

01:10:15.288 --> 01:10:17.295
Just a slightly
different statement.

01:10:22.630 --> 01:10:28.580
So we're going to have a
field, which we'll talk about,

01:10:28.580 --> 01:10:31.130
that I'll call c sub n,
which is a collinear quark

01:10:31.130 --> 01:10:35.818
field for some quark,
say an up quark.

01:10:35.818 --> 01:10:37.860
And there's also going to
be another field, q sub

01:10:37.860 --> 01:10:41.460
s, which is a soft quark
field for the same up quark.

01:10:45.587 --> 01:10:47.295
So let's say for the
up quark [INAUDIBLE]

01:10:47.295 --> 01:10:48.844
just to make it definite.

01:10:56.958 --> 01:10:59.000
And the reason that we're
going to have these two

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:00.260
different fields
is because they're

01:11:00.260 --> 01:11:01.718
going to describe
the same particle

01:11:01.718 --> 01:11:03.763
but in different regions
of momentum space.

01:11:03.763 --> 01:11:05.930
So if you like, they're
describing different degrees

01:11:05.930 --> 01:11:07.910
of freedom of the same
particle because they're

01:11:07.910 --> 01:11:09.800
in different regions
of momentum space.

01:11:09.800 --> 01:11:11.250
But it still is
the same particle,

01:11:11.250 --> 01:11:13.760
and that's not something
we've had to deal with in any

01:11:13.760 --> 01:11:14.840
of our examples so far.

01:11:14.840 --> 01:11:16.610
We always had one field
for each particle.

01:11:16.610 --> 01:11:18.920
Now we're going to
have more than one,

01:11:18.920 --> 01:11:20.936
so that's one complication.

01:11:25.040 --> 01:11:29.030
The second one we have
actually encountered before,

01:11:29.030 --> 01:11:32.060
and that is that we're
going to integrate out

01:11:32.060 --> 01:11:45.950
off-shell modes of a field, but
not the entire particle, not

01:11:45.950 --> 01:11:49.400
the entire degree of freedom.

01:11:49.400 --> 01:11:53.140
And we encountered that
when we talked about HQET.

01:11:53.140 --> 01:11:57.260
So the situation here will
be a little more complicated

01:11:57.260 --> 01:12:02.240
than HQET, but this
second point is like HQET,

01:12:02.240 --> 01:12:03.890
and we'll use some
of our experience

01:12:03.890 --> 01:12:05.885
that we gained
from studying HQET.

01:12:15.504 --> 01:12:17.212
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
soft and collinear?

01:12:17.212 --> 01:12:18.232
Which one--

01:12:18.232 --> 01:12:19.690
IAIN STEWART: It
never can be both.

01:12:19.690 --> 01:12:20.190
[CHUCKLES]

01:12:20.190 --> 01:12:22.233
AUDIENCE: Why?

01:12:22.233 --> 01:12:23.650
IAIN STEWART: We'll
have to decide

01:12:23.650 --> 01:12:25.640
whether it's one or the other.

01:12:25.640 --> 01:12:27.640
So an important thing--

01:12:27.640 --> 01:12:31.180
exactly this issue of which
it is an important thing

01:12:31.180 --> 01:12:33.130
because you're going
to be describing

01:12:33.130 --> 01:12:35.170
with these fields
certain fluctuations,

01:12:35.170 --> 01:12:36.835
and you don't want overlap.

01:12:36.835 --> 01:12:39.460
So you're going to have to-- if
you point your finger somewhere

01:12:39.460 --> 01:12:41.703
in momentum space,
we'll have to decide

01:12:41.703 --> 01:12:43.370
is it in this category
or this category.

01:12:43.370 --> 01:12:44.770
It can't be in both.

01:12:44.770 --> 01:12:46.510
But that will be
important in a bit.

01:12:46.510 --> 01:12:47.360
That will come back.

01:12:47.360 --> 01:12:48.693
AUDIENCE: So you're partioning--

01:12:48.693 --> 01:12:52.148
IAIN STEWART: Yeah, two
regions, and no overlap.

01:12:52.148 --> 01:12:54.690
But we'll have to work a little
bit to make sure that's true.

01:13:03.270 --> 01:13:04.740
Yeah, we want to
make sure to not

01:13:04.740 --> 01:13:07.320
have double counting in the
effective theory, where you

01:13:07.320 --> 01:13:10.590
could write down something
that looks like it could

01:13:10.590 --> 01:13:11.760
be described by either one.

01:13:11.760 --> 01:13:14.750
And if that was true, then
we would have a problem.

01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:28.860
So another thing that makes
SCET interesting from an EFT

01:13:28.860 --> 01:13:31.320
point of view is that
we have convolutions.

01:13:31.320 --> 01:13:33.900
So usually in an
effective theory

01:13:33.900 --> 01:13:36.300
you think about having
multiple operators that

01:13:36.300 --> 01:13:38.487
have the same quantum numbers.

01:13:38.487 --> 01:13:40.945
We sum over those operators,
say at some order in the power

01:13:40.945 --> 01:13:45.780
counting, sum over i of Wilson
coefficients times operators.

01:13:45.780 --> 01:13:51.206
And this sum becomes a
continuous integral in SCET.

01:13:51.206 --> 01:13:54.370
You'll see how that works.

01:13:54.370 --> 01:13:56.520
And that actually
leads to convolutions.

01:13:56.520 --> 01:13:58.775
In fact, exactly this
little manipulation

01:13:58.775 --> 01:14:00.900
here is what leads to the
convolution of the parton

01:14:00.900 --> 01:14:03.570
distribution function
with hard scattering.

01:14:03.570 --> 01:14:06.090
If you think about this
operator is describing--

01:14:06.090 --> 01:14:07.590
the matrix elements
of this operator

01:14:07.590 --> 01:14:09.990
is describing a parton
distribution function.

01:14:09.990 --> 01:14:12.690
The Wilson's coefficients is
describing the hard scattering.

01:14:12.690 --> 01:14:14.370
Exactly this integral
is what leads

01:14:14.370 --> 01:14:17.730
to the integral the convolutes
together parton distribution

01:14:17.730 --> 01:14:22.760
functions and hard
scattering matrix elements.

01:14:22.760 --> 01:14:23.540
Come back to that.

01:14:34.275 --> 01:14:35.900
So there's going to
be a power counting

01:14:35.900 --> 01:14:36.983
for this effective theory.

01:14:38.923 --> 01:14:41.090
And we're going to call the
power counting parameter

01:14:41.090 --> 01:14:44.490
lambda, and it's not going to
be related to the mass dimension

01:14:44.490 --> 01:14:44.990
of fields.

01:14:56.780 --> 01:14:59.790
So we'll have to figure out
how to do the power counting.

01:15:05.470 --> 01:15:09.460
There's going to be something
called the Wilson line, which

01:15:09.460 --> 01:15:11.980
will show up all over the
place in this effective theory.

01:15:19.420 --> 01:15:22.360
So these are lines in space
that are coupled to the gauge

01:15:22.360 --> 01:15:27.520
field, A. And we'll see
why they're showing up,

01:15:27.520 --> 01:15:29.290
but it's related
actually to the fact

01:15:29.290 --> 01:15:32.920
that this effective theory has
a very interesting and perhaps

01:15:32.920 --> 01:15:36.250
subtle gauge symmetry structure.

01:15:42.940 --> 01:15:45.395
One way of actually already
seeing why that is true

01:15:45.395 --> 01:15:47.020
is because I told
you over here that we

01:15:47.020 --> 01:15:48.620
have two types of quarks.

01:15:48.620 --> 01:15:50.880
Everything I say about quarks
is also true of gluons,

01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:52.672
so there's going to be
two types of gluons,

01:15:52.672 --> 01:15:55.348
an A n gluon and an A s gluon.

01:15:55.348 --> 01:15:56.890
And once there's
two types of gluons,

01:15:56.890 --> 01:15:58.930
you should say, well, what's
the gauge group of this gluon

01:15:58.930 --> 01:15:59.930
and what's the gauge
group for that gluon?

01:15:59.930 --> 01:16:01.597
Well, they're both
the same gauge group.

01:16:01.597 --> 01:16:02.710
It's QCD.

01:16:02.710 --> 01:16:05.485
So we partitioned QCD in
some kind of weird way,

01:16:05.485 --> 01:16:07.360
where we have two fields
for the gauge group,

01:16:07.360 --> 01:16:09.705
rather than just one.

01:16:09.705 --> 01:16:11.080
Part of that story
is going to be

01:16:11.080 --> 01:16:12.330
related to these Wilson lines.

01:16:16.970 --> 01:16:19.430
And finally, one final
kind of interesting thing

01:16:19.430 --> 01:16:21.500
that's going to
happen is we're going

01:16:21.500 --> 01:16:25.670
to see when we do one-loop
calculations in this theory

01:16:25.670 --> 01:16:30.208
that we find 1 over epsilon
squared divergences.

01:16:30.208 --> 01:16:32.250
So usually, when you do
an effective field theory

01:16:32.250 --> 01:16:36.890
calculation, at one loop you
find a 1 over epsilon pole,

01:16:36.890 --> 01:16:39.740
not a 1 over epsilon squared.

01:16:39.740 --> 01:16:44.000
And I denote it by epsilon
u v because both poles here

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:47.650
require u v renormalization.

01:16:47.650 --> 01:16:51.830
We need to add a counterterm
to cancel this double pole.

01:16:51.830 --> 01:16:53.840
And exactly the presence
of that double pole

01:16:53.840 --> 01:16:58.813
is what leads to these Sudakov
logs that I was mentioning,

01:16:58.813 --> 01:17:00.230
the fact that we
have these double

01:17:00.230 --> 01:17:03.080
logs going along
with each alpha s.

01:17:03.080 --> 01:17:05.895
So we'll see that taking care
of this with renormalization,

01:17:05.895 --> 01:17:08.270
which is little different than
the renormalization you're

01:17:08.270 --> 01:17:13.580
used to, will allow us to sum
up those Sudakov logarithms, OK?

01:17:13.580 --> 01:17:16.190
So that's the kind
of hint of the things

01:17:16.190 --> 01:17:17.450
that we will be studying.

01:17:17.450 --> 01:17:19.325
You're not supposed to
understand any of them

01:17:19.325 --> 01:17:20.930
yet unless you've
study SCET, but we

01:17:20.930 --> 01:17:23.180
will understand all of these
by the end of the course.

01:17:25.930 --> 01:17:27.580
OK?

01:17:27.580 --> 01:17:28.720
Any question?

01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:30.010
Anything I missed on my list?

01:17:30.010 --> 01:17:33.040
[CHUCKLES] All right.

01:17:37.260 --> 01:17:40.080
So let's spend some time talking
about degrees of freedom.

01:17:47.175 --> 01:17:49.387
The way I like to think
about degrees of freedom

01:17:49.387 --> 01:17:50.762
for any effective
field theory is

01:17:50.762 --> 01:17:53.137
this is where you have to
think about the physics of what

01:17:53.137 --> 01:17:55.000
you're doing, OK?

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.190
So let's think about
some physical process.

01:17:57.190 --> 01:18:00.130
I'm going to consider two
different physical processes.

01:18:00.130 --> 01:18:02.590
Actually, today, I'll only
start talking about one of them,

01:18:02.590 --> 01:18:05.320
and then we'll talk about
the other one next time.

01:18:05.320 --> 01:18:06.880
Think about some
physical process

01:18:06.880 --> 01:18:09.310
and try to identify what the
right degrees of freedom are.

01:18:15.860 --> 01:18:18.070
So you could look at
the process of a B meson

01:18:18.070 --> 01:18:20.495
changing into a D
meson and a pion.

01:18:20.495 --> 01:18:22.120
The advantage of
starting with this one

01:18:22.120 --> 01:18:24.500
is that we've already
talked about HQET,

01:18:24.500 --> 01:18:26.620
so we understand how to
do B mesons and D mesons,

01:18:26.620 --> 01:18:28.703
and we just have to
understand how to do the pion.

01:18:34.810 --> 01:18:36.010
So we have a B meson.

01:18:36.010 --> 01:18:38.270
Let's think about it
in the rest frame.

01:18:38.270 --> 01:18:41.260
Decays to a very heavy D
meson and a very light pion.

01:18:44.210 --> 01:18:46.190
So the D meson we
can treat with HQET.

01:18:46.190 --> 01:18:48.680
The B meson we can
treat with HQET.

01:18:48.680 --> 01:18:53.390
The problem is this pion
because it's very energetic.

01:18:53.390 --> 01:18:57.260
If you look at the momentum
of that pion and the way

01:18:57.260 --> 01:19:02.960
I've drawn it, and you
put in some numbers just

01:19:02.960 --> 01:19:13.730
to get a sense of what
we're talking about,

01:19:13.730 --> 01:19:15.163
then it's got an
energy, which is

01:19:15.163 --> 01:19:16.580
slightly bigger
than the momentum,

01:19:16.580 --> 01:19:17.960
and that's because
it has a mass,

01:19:17.960 --> 01:19:19.250
but it's a pretty small mass.

01:19:21.980 --> 01:19:26.585
e squared minus p squared
is 135 m e V squared.

01:19:30.160 --> 01:19:33.570
And so if you look
at that, you see

01:19:33.570 --> 01:19:35.490
that this momentum
of the pion is

01:19:35.490 --> 01:19:36.710
very close to the light cone.

01:19:36.710 --> 01:19:39.100
The light cone would be
if these two were equal.

01:19:39.100 --> 01:19:43.030
That's what a massless
particle would do.

01:19:43.030 --> 01:19:47.140
A pion is pretty light, and
it's moving relativistically,

01:19:47.140 --> 01:19:49.930
and there's no sense in which
we can think about 2.3 G e

01:19:49.930 --> 01:19:51.230
V as a small scale.

01:19:51.230 --> 01:19:54.550
We're not going to expand
in 2.3 G e V over m B

01:19:54.550 --> 01:19:58.610
because that's a
pretty lousy expansion.

01:19:58.610 --> 01:20:02.740
So p pi mu here is
basically some scale

01:20:02.740 --> 01:20:11.260
times a light-like vector,
where n mu is 1, 0, 0, minus 1,

01:20:11.260 --> 01:20:13.960
and that's to a
good approximation.

01:20:13.960 --> 01:20:15.310
We'll see how good over there.

01:20:19.330 --> 01:20:21.850
So we're going to use
light-like vectors to talk

01:20:21.850 --> 01:20:24.550
about particles like a pion.

01:20:24.550 --> 01:20:27.850
So n mu is a light-like vector.

01:20:27.850 --> 01:20:28.845
n squared is 0.

01:20:34.295 --> 01:20:35.920
And what we're going
to be expanding in

01:20:35.920 --> 01:20:39.310
is, instead of expanding
in Q over m B, Q over pion,

01:20:39.310 --> 01:20:44.560
we're going to think about
the dynamics with this scale Q

01:20:44.560 --> 01:20:47.230
scale, 2.3 G e V as being
much bigger than lambda QCD.

01:20:51.090 --> 01:20:52.590
So we're going to
use, for particles

01:20:52.590 --> 01:20:54.215
like this pion that
are very energetic,

01:20:54.215 --> 01:20:55.741
light cone coordinates.

01:21:06.330 --> 01:21:10.320
So when you have a
light cone vector like n

01:21:10.320 --> 01:21:13.470
and you want to decompose
any vector in terms of it,

01:21:13.470 --> 01:21:15.610
you need another
auxiliary vector,

01:21:15.610 --> 01:21:17.840
which I'm going to call n bar.

01:21:17.840 --> 01:21:20.250
So these are two
light-like vectors.

01:21:20.250 --> 01:21:22.410
They both square to 0.

01:21:22.410 --> 01:21:23.790
And the reason I
need two of them

01:21:23.790 --> 01:21:26.190
is because I need some
notion of orthogonality,

01:21:26.190 --> 01:21:30.020
so you should think of n bar as
like the complementary vector

01:21:30.020 --> 01:21:31.830
to n.

01:21:31.830 --> 01:21:35.670
It's the dual vector in
the orthogonal sense.

01:21:38.830 --> 01:21:41.640
So with those two vectors,
you can decompose any vector

01:21:41.640 --> 01:21:42.270
in terms of--

01:21:45.480 --> 01:21:46.470
use them as a basis.

01:21:50.781 --> 01:21:55.820
This is how it works,
my conventions.

01:21:55.820 --> 01:22:00.890
So you have two components that
you can decompose along n and n

01:22:00.890 --> 01:22:05.200
bar, and the value of the
momentum along that direction

01:22:05.200 --> 01:22:06.950
is the complementary
vector dotted into p.

01:22:10.290 --> 01:22:11.510
And so we usually--

01:22:11.510 --> 01:22:16.010
with this notation, we
call n bar dot p p minus.

01:22:16.010 --> 01:22:18.740
So that's just a shorthand.

01:22:18.740 --> 01:22:24.353
And n dot p is p plus, OK?

01:22:24.353 --> 01:22:26.270
So it's going to be
useful to decompose things

01:22:26.270 --> 01:22:28.020
along these directions
for the same reason

01:22:28.020 --> 01:22:30.980
that you kind of saw here,
that the pion was naturally

01:22:30.980 --> 01:22:33.380
decomposing itself along
a particular light-like

01:22:33.380 --> 01:22:33.978
direction.

01:22:33.978 --> 01:22:36.020
So we're going to want to
do that more generally,

01:22:36.020 --> 01:22:37.645
and that's how we'll
do it for momenta.

01:22:40.720 --> 01:22:47.840
If we talk about p squared, and
I just square the components

01:22:47.840 --> 01:22:52.070
here, n dotted into
"perp" is 0, and bar

01:22:52.070 --> 01:22:53.360
dotted into "perp" is 0.

01:22:53.360 --> 01:22:55.450
There's a nontrivial--
that's square root of 0.

01:22:55.450 --> 01:22:56.450
That's square root of 0.

01:22:56.450 --> 01:22:58.533
There's a nontrivial
cross-term between those two,

01:22:58.533 --> 01:22:59.550
which is this.

01:22:59.550 --> 01:23:00.635
This guy can be squared.

01:23:05.610 --> 01:23:09.900
If we use our shorthand,
then it's this.

01:23:09.900 --> 01:23:15.050
And if we want to use Euclidean
notation, then I can--

01:23:15.050 --> 01:23:18.020
I'll switch and I'll say
that p "perp" squared, which

01:23:18.020 --> 01:23:19.640
is a Minkowski
negative quantity,

01:23:19.640 --> 01:23:22.190
is minus p vector
"perp" squared,

01:23:22.190 --> 01:23:24.350
where p vector "perp"
squared is Euclidean.

01:23:30.080 --> 01:23:35.150
So sometimes I'll-- use for
both of those notations.

01:23:35.150 --> 01:23:37.340
All right, so I think we're
out of time for today.

01:23:37.340 --> 01:23:39.620
We'll continue with this
discussion of degrees

01:23:39.620 --> 01:23:43.100
of freedom next time and
talk a little bit more

01:23:43.100 --> 01:23:45.430
about coordinates, as well.

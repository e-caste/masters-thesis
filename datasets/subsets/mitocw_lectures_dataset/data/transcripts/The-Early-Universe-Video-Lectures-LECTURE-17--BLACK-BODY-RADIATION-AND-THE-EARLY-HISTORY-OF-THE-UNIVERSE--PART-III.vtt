00:00:21.827 --> 00:00:22.410
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.440
In That case, let's get started.

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:28.680
First with our review of what
we talked about last time.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.800
We began by talking
about the dynamics

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.080
of a flat radiation-dominated
universe, which

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:36.900
is very straightforward.

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.440
We start with Friedmann's
equation for a flat universe.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.910
For radiation, rho is
proportional to one over a

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:44.610
to the fourth.

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.320
So that gets us a
dot over a squared

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.140
is equal to a constant
over a to the fourth.

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.850
Rearranging that we can
write it as a times da

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.420
is equal to the square root
of that constant times dt.

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.450
And then we can just
integrate both sides.

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:05.190
So you get one half a squared
is equal to the square root

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:10.270
of the constant times t, plus
a new constant, constant prime.

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.060
OK, then we say that we can
adjust this constant prime

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:14.570
by resetting our clocks.

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.570
And we haven't said
anything yet that determines

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:18.130
how our clocks are set.

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.540
So the standard convention
is to set your clocks

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.960
so that t equals 0 is the time
when the scale factor is zero.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.950
And that corresponds to
constant prime equals zero,

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.090
as one can see by just
looking at that equation.

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.060
So that's what we do when the
constant prime term disappears.

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.760
And then we don't care about
the constant of proportionality

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:36.850
anyway.

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.530
For a flat universe the
constant of proportionality

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:40.660
is completely meaningless.

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:43.820
It just tells you how
many meters per notch

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.590
you're dealing with, so
it defines your notch,

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.490
but otherwise has no
physical meaning whatever.

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.400
So the important bottom
line is that a of t

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.310
is proportional to
the square root of t

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.990
for a flat [INAUDIBLE]
dominated universe.

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.920
And once one knows
that, one can easily

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.890
get quite a few other things.

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:04.390
OK.

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.030
As I was just saying, once
you now how a of t behaves

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.780
you can immediately calculate
lots of other things.

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.360
And in particular h is a dot
over a and that is just 1

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:28.590
over 2t.

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.740
So we know what h is,
a function of time,

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:32.370
even without putting
any more details

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.450
about what kind of
radiation we have.

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:35.620
It doesn't matter.

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.960
You still get h is
equal to 1 over 2t.

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.940
The horizon distance is given
by the formula a of t times

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.830
the integral from 0
to t of c over a of t

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.466
prime, dt prime, the
interval represents

00:02:48.466 --> 00:02:50.090
the total co-moving
distance that light

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.140
could travel between
time 0 at time t.

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.200
And then one multiplies
that by the scale

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.930
factor time t to turn it
into a physical distance,

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.380
and that then becomes the
horizon distance of time t.

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:01.939
And that is two times ct.

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:03.480
You might remember
it was three times

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.550
ct for the
matter-dominated case.

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:10.640
And then finally you
even know exactly what

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.240
the mass density is
as a function of time.

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:19.140
Because 8 squared is 8 pi over
3 rho a pi g over 3 times rho.

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:20.340
And we know what h is.

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.340
So that tells me
what row is also.

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.940
We actually know the mass
density as a function of time,

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:27.280
independent of anything else.

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:31.230
OK.

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.920
Then we began talking about
black-body radiation, which

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:41.160
is basically a gas of massless
particles at a temperature t

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.810
that is a gas of
massless particles

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.166
in thermal equilibrium.

00:03:44.166 --> 00:03:45.790
And it turns out that
the temperature t

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:48.620
determines almost everything.

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.580
So the energy density of
black-body radiation, u,

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:56.160
which is the same as rho
mass density times c squared,

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.820
is equal to a kind of a
fudge factor g times pi

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:06.120
squared over 30 times kt to
the fourth, over h bar c cubed.

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.914
And this fudge factor g
is equal to 2 for photons.

00:04:09.914 --> 00:04:12.330
And the reason we gave it a
letter instead of just writing

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:14.070
a two in the formula
in the first place

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:16.403
is that we'll soon be talking
about black-body radiation

00:04:16.403 --> 00:04:18.329
of other kinds of
particles, and g

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:21.339
will be different for
different kinds of particles.

00:04:21.339 --> 00:04:25.090
The two for photons
is given the number

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.920
two because there are two
spin states of photons.

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:32.670
Photons that are massless
spin one particle and massless

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:35.935
particles, all we have maximum
spins, they don't have spins

00:04:35.935 --> 00:04:39.250
in the middle, so they spin
along one axis for a photon

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:42.650
is either plus or minus
1, which is two spins.

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:44.760
That's the quantum
mechanical description.

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:48.330
It corresponds completely
to the classical description

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.552
that you can separate
any light wave

00:04:50.552 --> 00:04:52.760
into left-circularly polarized
and a right-circularly

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:55.450
polarized part.

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:57.880
Or equivalently, you could
separate it into an x-polarized

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:01.290
and and y-polarized part.

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:04.260
And you can get x-polarization
by superimposing

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.960
left and right, so these are
not alternative polarizations.

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.480
They're just two different
ways of describing

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:12.200
the general polarization.

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:14.390
The general causation
is a linear combination

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:20.150
of either left and right or
linear combination of x and y.

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:22.900
In any case, the basis
has two basis elements,

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:25.620
and that's where
the two comes from.

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:27.490
Next item on our
list is the pressure

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:30.100
which could be calculated from
the statistical mechanics,

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:32.634
and we've already
calculated by other means.

00:05:32.634 --> 00:05:34.467
But the answer, not
matter how you calculate

00:05:34.467 --> 00:05:36.820
is is p equals 1/3 u.

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:41.707
Next we talked about
the number density.

00:05:41.707 --> 00:05:44.040
And these are all calculations
that we didn't really do.

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:46.510
I'm just quoting
standard calculations

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:48.450
from statistical mechanics.

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:50.800
And you can learn how
to do them presumably

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.630
by some [INAUDIBLE] class.

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:56.370
The number density is
a different constant g

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:58.450
star, in general it's different.

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:00.400
For photons it ends
up being the same.

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:02.260
But in general a
different constant,

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:06.130
g star times zeta
of 3 where zeta of 3

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:10.430
is the Riemann zeta function
evaluated at argument three.

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:13.460
And that's equal to 1 over
1 cubed plus 1 over 2 cubed,

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:15.512
plus 1 over 3 cubed dot dot dot.

00:06:15.512 --> 00:06:20.570
And it adds up to 1.202
to three decimal places.

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:24.150
And then the rest divided by
pi squared then times kt cubed,

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:25.880
over h bar c cubed.

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:28.436
So the number [INAUDIBLE] like
the cube of the temperature,

00:06:28.436 --> 00:06:30.560
while the energy density
went like the fourth power

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:31.351
of the temperature.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.810
And the g star that appears here
as I mentioned already I think

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:39.070
is 2 for photons.

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:42.100
And we'll learn
more later about how

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:45.420
to apply this to other
kinds of particles.

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:51.490
And finally the entropy
density is the same g

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:56.670
as we had for energy densities
times 2 pi squared over 45 k

00:06:56.670 --> 00:06:58.440
to the fourth t
cubed, again it goes

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:02.570
like t cubed, divided
by h bar c cubed.

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:06.780
And entropy is a
somewhat subtle concept.

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:09.730
Fortunately for our
purposes we will not

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:13.935
need to know much at all about
what entropy actually is.

00:07:13.935 --> 00:07:19.450
I might just say for some sense
of completeness that entropy

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:22.590
is a measure of quote
the disorder of a state.

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:25.170
And this "disorder"
means some measure

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:29.040
of the number of different
microscopic quantum states

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:32.165
that contribute to a given
macroscopic classical

00:07:32.165 --> 00:07:32.665
description.

00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:39.470
The important thing for
us is, well first of all,

00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:41.200
that the second law
of thermodynamics

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:43.677
tells us that entropy
never decreases,

00:07:43.677 --> 00:07:46.260
but we're going to make use of
a much stronger statement which

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:49.040
holds very well for the
early universe, which

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:54.680
is that if the system stays
close to family equilibrium,

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:57.230
then the entropy doesn't change.

00:07:57.230 --> 00:08:00.070
And in the early universe
I think for every process

00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:04.150
that we're going to discuss
that condition holds.

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:06.840
The system stays close to
thermal equilibrium and entropy

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:08.210
is conserved.

00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:09.780
The one exception
will be inflation,

00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:11.905
which we'll learn about
near the end of the course.

00:08:11.905 --> 00:08:15.840
At the end of inflation there's
a humongously entropy producing

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:17.276
phase transition.

00:08:17.276 --> 00:08:19.794
And if inflation is right
essentially all of the entropy

00:08:19.794 --> 00:08:21.210
that we have int
he universe today

00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:23.610
was produced during
that phase transition.

00:08:23.610 --> 00:08:26.170
Before that there was
only negligible entropy.

00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:33.120
OK.

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:35.549
That's it for my summary.

00:08:35.549 --> 00:08:36.345
Any questions?

00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:41.503
Yes?

00:08:41.503 --> 00:08:43.918
AUDIENCE: I know it's a law
that entropy only increases.

00:08:43.918 --> 00:08:46.450
Is there anything
behind that or is it

00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:50.180
just it's a law of physics?

00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:52.440
PROFESSOR: Yeah, that's
a subtle question,

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:56.952
which I think if you ask 10
different physicists you'll

00:08:56.952 --> 00:08:58.285
likely get 10 different answers.

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:04.830
But one thing's for
sure is that it does not

00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:07.120
follow as a consequence from
the other laws of physics

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:08.167
that we know.

00:09:08.167 --> 00:09:09.750
The other laws of
physics that we know

00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:12.290
are essentially time,
reversal, and variant.

00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:16.690
So why entropy always increases
is something of a mystery.

00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:21.310
The usual story is something
like the early universe,

00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:24.390
for reasons unknown, started
in the state of peculiarly

00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:24.905
low entropy.

00:09:27.690 --> 00:09:30.430
And because it started low it's
approaching the equilibrium

00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:32.670
value, which is much larger.

00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:34.735
So that's a possible
explanation.

00:09:34.735 --> 00:09:36.360
I actually am in the
process of writing

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:39.296
a paper about the growth of
entropy in the hour of time,

00:09:39.296 --> 00:09:40.920
and maybe I'll get
a chance to tell you

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:42.961
about that sometime before
the end of the course,

00:09:42.961 --> 00:09:44.404
but I won't try
to explain it now.

00:09:44.404 --> 00:09:45.820
But it's a slightly
different idea

00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:47.927
about what could explain it.

00:09:47.927 --> 00:09:49.260
But it's something of a mystery.

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:52.680
Nobody really knows what
determines the arrow of time,

00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:54.300
why entropy only goes one way.

00:09:58.432 --> 00:09:59.265
Any other questions?

00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:03.801
OK.

00:10:03.801 --> 00:10:05.300
What I want to do
now is to continue

00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:06.960
talking about
black-body radiation.

00:10:09.977 --> 00:10:11.810
I think we've said
everything that we wanted

00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:15.100
to say about photons,
but now we want

00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:18.350
to apply to other
kinds of particles.

00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:22.160
And we're going to begin with
neutrinos, because neutrinos

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:25.680
certainly do account for
a significant fraction

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:27.783
of the entropy in the
universe today even.

00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:37.090
Neutrinos were, until
around 1990 or so,

00:10:37.090 --> 00:10:39.940
thought to be massless.

00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:43.860
Now we know that they in
fact have a small mass.

00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:47.190
I think I mentioned last
time that we have never

00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:51.520
measured the mass of a neutrino
and largely for that reason,

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:53.837
we don't actually know
what the masses are.

00:10:53.837 --> 00:10:55.420
But what we have
measured is something

00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:58.620
that's quantum mechanical
and rather peculiar, which

00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:02.220
is that one type of
neutrino, and neutrinos

00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:04.220
come in three types, or flavors.

00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:22.770
And that is nu sub e, nu
sub mu, and nu sub tau.

00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:25.980
And what we've seen is that
neutrinos of one flavor

00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:28.800
can turn into, just by
traveling through space,

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:31.360
a neutrino of the other flavor.

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:35.810
And that can only happen
if there's a non-zero mass.

00:11:35.810 --> 00:11:40.540
And what it
particular measures is

00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:44.720
delta m squared
between the neutrinos.

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:47.240
And I think I even
wrote on the formulas

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:52.180
on the blackboard for
the known limits of that.

00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:54.100
So I won't write it again.

00:11:54.100 --> 00:12:00.464
But neutrino
oscillation, which is

00:12:00.464 --> 00:12:02.130
what we call this,
the conversion of one

00:12:02.130 --> 00:12:06.480
kind of neutrino
to another, implies

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:12.649
that delta m squared
is not equal to zero.

00:12:12.649 --> 00:12:14.190
So it's still, in
principle, possible

00:12:14.190 --> 00:12:16.106
that one of these neutrinos
could be massless,

00:12:16.106 --> 00:12:17.552
but they can't all be massless.

00:12:17.552 --> 00:12:19.385
If one is massless, the
other two have mass.

00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:30.150
And of delta m
squared is very small.

00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:32.525
So these would be smaller
masses than any other particles

00:12:32.525 --> 00:12:35.740
that we know of in the universe.

00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:40.800
Now for purposes of
cosmology it turns out

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:44.120
that you can get by by
thinking of the neutrinos

00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:46.220
as being massless.

00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:48.970
And then we'll start by
discussing it that way.

00:12:48.970 --> 00:12:50.800
It's not quite as
trivial as just

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:52.490
saying that the mass
is a small number.

00:12:52.490 --> 00:12:54.580
So if you have a formula
that involves the mass,

00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:55.952
you can usually neglect it.

00:12:55.952 --> 00:12:58.410
It's a little bit more subtle
because whether the neutrinos

00:12:58.410 --> 00:13:01.489
are massless or massive affects
the number of spin states.

00:13:01.489 --> 00:13:03.780
And we're going to even treat
the number of spin states

00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:06.740
as if the neutrino is
massless, which obviously

00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:09.010
is a bit of a cheat and
needs further explanation.

00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:12.290
But I'm going to do it
first for massless neutrinos

00:13:12.290 --> 00:13:15.020
and we'll come back
later to discuss

00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:18.610
why you can get the same answers
if the neutrino has a mass.

00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:35.695
So we're going to
start out imagining

00:13:35.695 --> 00:13:36.820
that the nu's are massless.

00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:49.890
And in that approximation
there is only

00:13:49.890 --> 00:13:54.410
one spin state for a neutrino
and it's left-handed.

00:14:21.450 --> 00:14:27.520
And that means that the spin
points the opposite direction

00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:29.930
from the momentum.

00:14:29.930 --> 00:14:32.280
So if the neutrino is
spinning like this,

00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:33.770
which my right hand
will correspond

00:14:33.770 --> 00:14:36.180
to a spin in that
direction, the momentum

00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:39.380
will always be in
that direction.

00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:41.350
And I can do the
same thing this way.

00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:43.519
If it's spinning like
this, the spin is that way,

00:14:43.519 --> 00:14:44.810
the momentum would be that way.

00:14:44.810 --> 00:14:49.520
The momentum's always the
opposite direction of the spin.

00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:51.490
Now you might
realize and that that

00:14:51.490 --> 00:14:55.200
leads to a question
about Lorentz invariance.

00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:58.620
If the spin and the momentum
point in opposite directions

00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:01.640
in some frame, it's not
obvious if they would also

00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:04.590
point in opposite directions
in some other frame.

00:15:04.590 --> 00:15:06.420
But it turns out to be true.

00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:10.070
One can verify that, which
we're not going to do,

00:15:10.070 --> 00:15:13.400
but it is a Lorentz
invariance statement,

00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:15.110
as long as the
particle's massless.

00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:16.680
If the particle's
not massless it

00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:20.580
is clearly not a Lorentz
invariance statement.

00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:22.400
And that's easy to say.

00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:25.240
If the particle were
not massless, and say

00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:28.450
it was spinning this way,
so the spin is that way,

00:15:28.450 --> 00:15:31.080
and the momentum is
that way, that way

00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:33.850
the situation and the
particle had a mass,

00:15:33.850 --> 00:15:36.710
then I could change Lorentz
frames by jumping into a rocket

00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:39.510
ship, and shooting
off in this direction,

00:15:39.510 --> 00:15:41.700
the same direction the
particle is moving,

00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:44.710
and since the particle is moving
with some finite velocity,

00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:47.230
if it has a mass, there has
to be a finite velocity,

00:15:47.230 --> 00:15:49.930
in principle the
spaceship can overtake it.

00:15:49.930 --> 00:15:52.724
And when the spaceship
overtakes it,

00:15:52.724 --> 00:15:54.390
from the point of
view of the spaceship,

00:15:54.390 --> 00:15:56.670
the momentum will now
be pointing that way,

00:15:56.670 --> 00:16:00.220
but the spin doesn't change
when the spaceship overtakes it.

00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:02.180
So this relationship
between spin and momentum

00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:04.830
is manifestly not
Lorentz invariant

00:16:04.830 --> 00:16:06.530
when the particle
has a mass, which

00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:08.450
is why we are cheating
in a somewhat big way

00:16:08.450 --> 00:16:10.580
here, by saying that
we're going to treat

00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:11.950
the neutrinos is massless.

00:16:11.950 --> 00:16:14.680
We're going to even
be ignoring this fact

00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:16.790
that what we're saying
about the spin and momentum

00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:19.590
is not even Lorentz invariant
if the particle has a mass.

00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:21.640
And we'll make better
excuses for that later,

00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:25.954
but for now we'll see simple
picture first, and then

00:16:25.954 --> 00:16:27.870
talk about the more
complicated picture later.

00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:41.800
Anti neutrinos, which I'll
write with a bar over it,

00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:43.075
also have one spin state.

00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:53.830
And as you might guess
since anti particles are

00:16:53.830 --> 00:16:55.705
kind of the opposite
of particles,

00:16:55.705 --> 00:16:56.580
that is right-handed.

00:17:09.550 --> 00:17:17.020
Now in addition neutrinos differ
from photons in that neutrinos

00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:20.640
belong to a class of
particles called fermions.

00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:23.140
Photons are bosons.

00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:25.530
How many of you already
know about [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:25.530 --> 00:17:27.511
fermion or boson?

00:17:27.511 --> 00:17:28.010
OK.

00:17:28.010 --> 00:17:29.380
Most, but not quite all.

00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:31.240
Fair enough.

00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:35.620
So fermions are particles
that obey the Fermi exclusion

00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:37.640
principle that
you're very likely

00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:39.600
learned about in a
chemistry class someplace.

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:41.100
It says that no
two particles can

00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:44.360
be in exactly the
same quantum state.

00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:46.240
Bosons do not obey
such a principle.

00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:47.990
In fact, bosons are
even more likely to be

00:17:47.990 --> 00:17:50.460
found in the same quantum state.

00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:52.460
And that's the
important difference.

00:17:52.460 --> 00:17:56.690
In quantum field theory, and
only in quantum field theory,

00:17:56.690 --> 00:17:59.474
you can't do this in just non
relativistic quantum mechanics,

00:17:59.474 --> 00:18:01.890
but in quantum field theory
you can prove something called

00:18:01.890 --> 00:18:04.730
the spin statistics
theorem, which

00:18:04.730 --> 00:18:08.640
says that particles with half
integer spins, that is 1/2,

00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:12.920
3/2, et cetera, are
necessarily fermions.

00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:17.500
And particles with integer
spins are necessarily bosons.

00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:19.840
So we know whether a particle
is a fermion or a Boson

00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:21.500
as soon as we know its spin.

00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:23.320
And in the case of
neutrino, it's spin 1/2.

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:42.872
So nu's have spin one half.

00:18:42.872 --> 00:18:44.080
And that makes them fermions.

00:18:59.450 --> 00:19:03.440
Now the statistical mechanics
formulas that we just went over

00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:05.980
come about from counting states.

00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:07.820
Basically the
underlying principle

00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:12.269
is that the system is
likely to be in any state

00:19:12.269 --> 00:19:14.810
that you could imagine with the
probability of e to the minus

00:19:14.810 --> 00:19:17.690
the energy of that
state, divided by kt

00:19:17.690 --> 00:19:19.570
all in the exponent.

00:19:19.570 --> 00:19:21.900
So it's state counting that
determines these formulas.

00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:24.149
And that means it's going
to be different for fermions

00:19:24.149 --> 00:19:26.032
and bosons because
for bosons you're

00:19:26.032 --> 00:19:27.740
going to count situations
where there are

00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:30.140
many particles in
the same state.

00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:32.567
And for fermions you're not.

00:19:32.567 --> 00:19:34.025
And in particular
that means you're

00:19:34.025 --> 00:19:38.090
going to be counting more
states for the bosons

00:19:38.090 --> 00:19:41.230
and to be counting fewer
states for the fermions.

00:19:41.230 --> 00:19:44.440
So you would expect these
constants g and g star

00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:49.780
to be smaller for fermions
than they are for those bosons.

00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:51.530
And that indeed is true.

00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:23.418
So for fermions g
gets an extra factor

00:20:23.418 --> 00:20:30.610
that is multiplied by 7/8s.

00:20:35.290 --> 00:20:46.760
And g star is multiplied by 3/4.

00:20:57.430 --> 00:20:59.790
So I think we could have
predicted that these g's would

00:20:59.790 --> 00:21:01.672
get factors that
are less than 1,

00:21:01.672 --> 00:21:03.670
simply because we're
counting fewer states.

00:21:03.670 --> 00:21:06.890
I think we can also predict
without doing any calculations

00:21:06.890 --> 00:21:10.870
that g should have a
bigger factor than g star.

00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:12.740
Remember g star
is the factor that

00:21:12.740 --> 00:21:15.140
appears in the number density.

00:21:15.140 --> 00:21:18.600
So if we want to calculate the
average energy per particle

00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:21.170
at a given temperature,
we would take

00:21:21.170 --> 00:21:25.460
a formula which has a g in
it for the energy density,

00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:26.930
and divide it by
a formula that has

00:21:26.930 --> 00:21:29.060
a g star in it for
the number density.

00:21:29.060 --> 00:21:31.170
The energy density divided
by the number density

00:21:31.170 --> 00:21:32.610
is just the energy per particle.

00:21:32.610 --> 00:21:34.610
And this tells us that
we'll get a number that's

00:21:34.610 --> 00:21:38.150
bigger than 1 for the fermions.

00:21:38.150 --> 00:21:39.690
So for fermions,
there's slightly

00:21:39.690 --> 00:21:44.380
more energy per particle
than there is for bosons.

00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:47.330
And I think that's easily
believable because fermions

00:21:47.330 --> 00:21:48.580
obey this exclusion principle.

00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:50.871
It means once you put one
particle in the lowest energy

00:21:50.871 --> 00:21:52.400
state, you can't
put any more there.

00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:55.210
You have to put them in
higher energy states.

00:21:55.210 --> 00:21:57.042
So the expectation
would be that you

00:21:57.042 --> 00:21:59.000
have more energy per
particle with the fermions

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:03.170
and that is indeed what
the [INAUDIBLE] calculation

00:22:03.170 --> 00:22:05.980
indicates.

00:22:05.980 --> 00:22:16.130
So now we're ready to
write down a formula for g,

00:22:16.130 --> 00:22:18.560
for the neutrinos.

00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:20.150
And this will be
the overall g that

00:22:20.150 --> 00:22:22.390
occurs in the formula
for the energy

00:22:22.390 --> 00:22:28.250
density and the entropy density,
and the pressure for neutrinos.

00:22:28.250 --> 00:22:33.690
And it will, we'll write it
out as a string of factors.

00:22:33.690 --> 00:22:37.284
We'll first of all have this
factor 7/8 coming from the fact

00:22:37.284 --> 00:22:38.200
that they're fermions.

00:22:45.910 --> 00:22:49.320
Then we'll have
a factor of three

00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:51.492
because there are three flavors.

00:22:51.492 --> 00:22:53.450
And we're just going to
add them together here.

00:22:53.450 --> 00:22:54.830
So we get a factor of three.

00:22:59.430 --> 00:23:03.050
Then we get a factor
of two because there's

00:23:03.050 --> 00:23:04.525
particle anti particle pairs.

00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:14.255
That is, we have to count
both neutrinos and anti

00:23:14.255 --> 00:23:17.040
neutrinos, and the
total energy density.

00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:19.240
For photons, a photon is
the same as an anti photon,

00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:21.530
so you don't get an
extra particle connected

00:23:21.530 --> 00:23:22.600
with the anti particle.

00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:24.650
But for neutrinos you
do, so that gives you

00:23:24.650 --> 00:23:26.920
a factor of two here.

00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:31.347
And then you always have
the number of spin states,

00:23:31.347 --> 00:23:33.430
but in this case, the of
number spin state is one,

00:23:33.430 --> 00:23:35.300
but I'll write it
just so we can keep

00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:39.140
track of the general pattern.

00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:44.340
And when you do that
multiplication, you get 21/4.

00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:48.630
So g sub nu for all three
neutrinos put together is 21/4.

00:23:51.852 --> 00:23:53.810
And you could put this
into all of our formulas

00:23:53.810 --> 00:23:55.410
and get the energy
density pressure,

00:23:55.410 --> 00:23:57.465
and entropy density
for neutrinos.

00:24:00.550 --> 00:24:03.557
Then we're also interested
in g star, which

00:24:03.557 --> 00:24:04.890
will give us the number density.

00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:11.060
So g star sub nu.

00:24:11.060 --> 00:24:15.150
And it differs only
by the first factor.

00:24:15.150 --> 00:24:19.770
3/4 for the fermion
nature of the particle.

00:24:30.530 --> 00:24:34.620
And the rest is just dittos.

00:24:34.620 --> 00:24:37.665
And what you get
in the end is 9/2.

00:24:50.425 --> 00:24:53.200
OK, now this does not
end our discussion

00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:57.200
of black-body radiation
in the early universe

00:25:00.570 --> 00:25:03.750
Because as we go back
in time to earlier times

00:25:03.750 --> 00:25:07.440
we can come to a times when
KT, the main thermal energy,

00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:11.360
is large compared to the
rest energy of an electron,

00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:12.540
m sub e c squared.

00:25:40.490 --> 00:25:42.115
So at these very high
temperatures even

00:25:42.115 --> 00:25:47.510
e plus, e minus pairs contribute
to the black-body radiation.

00:26:04.930 --> 00:26:09.985
So we'd like to write down a
g four e plus, e minus pairs.

00:26:15.885 --> 00:26:18.510
Actually, maybe I shouldn't call
them pairs because they really

00:26:18.510 --> 00:26:22.700
are contributing individually,
but g for e plus, e minus.

00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:23.286
Yes?

00:26:23.286 --> 00:26:24.744
AUDIENCE: So I know
said that we're

00:26:24.744 --> 00:26:27.740
assuming, even though it's
a spin 1/2 particle that's

00:26:27.740 --> 00:26:29.608
just one spin state.

00:26:29.608 --> 00:26:32.048
I was wondering is it possible
for a spin 1/2 particle

00:26:32.048 --> 00:26:33.024
to be massless?

00:26:33.024 --> 00:26:37.032
I can't think of any
offhand, because don't they

00:26:37.032 --> 00:26:41.662
have to have m equals negative
1/2 state? [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:41.662 --> 00:26:42.427
in general.

00:26:42.427 --> 00:26:43.135
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:26:43.135 --> 00:26:45.140
No, it is perfectly
consistent, would

00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:48.020
be perfectly consistent for
neutrinos to be massless.

00:26:48.020 --> 00:26:50.520
And then they would only
have and m equals 1/2 state

00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:52.900
in spite of the fact
that their spin 1/2.

00:26:52.900 --> 00:26:57.170
And the m equals minus 1/2
state would just be missing,

00:26:57.170 --> 00:26:58.580
but that's OK.

00:26:58.580 --> 00:27:01.030
It's similar to what
happens with photons.

00:27:01.030 --> 00:27:03.100
Photons are spin one particles.

00:27:03.100 --> 00:27:06.150
And the m equals 0
state is missing.

00:27:06.150 --> 00:27:08.700
And that can only happen
with massless particles.

00:27:08.700 --> 00:27:12.010
For massive particles,
by basically the argument

00:27:12.010 --> 00:27:14.250
that I gave about catching
up to the neutrino,

00:27:14.250 --> 00:27:16.520
it's not possible
to have one helicity

00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:19.570
and not have the other.

00:27:19.570 --> 00:27:21.960
But for massless
particles it is possible.

00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:23.260
The photon does it.

00:27:23.260 --> 00:27:25.260
We used to think
the neutrino did it.

00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:26.815
Turned up the neutrino
doesn't do it,

00:27:26.815 --> 00:27:29.740
but we can still describe
the old theory, which

00:27:29.740 --> 00:27:31.300
is simpler than the new theory.

00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:32.383
And that's what I'm doing.

00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:38.227
AUDIENCE: Is there any
reason they're missing those?

00:27:38.227 --> 00:27:38.810
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:27:38.810 --> 00:27:40.360
The question is is
there any reason

00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:43.150
why they're missing
those spin states.

00:27:43.150 --> 00:27:47.967
The answer basically is that
there's no solid reason, which

00:27:47.967 --> 00:27:50.550
is why we didn't know if it was
going to be missing the states

00:27:50.550 --> 00:27:52.350
or not.

00:27:52.350 --> 00:27:55.580
But for the case of
massless particles

00:27:55.580 --> 00:28:00.330
only the m states
are all completely

00:28:00.330 --> 00:28:04.780
disconnected from each other
under Lorentz transformations.

00:28:04.780 --> 00:28:08.230
For any non-zero mass,
all the spin states mix.

00:28:08.230 --> 00:28:10.680
And because they all mix
under Lorentz transformations

00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:13.710
you can't have any one
without having all of them.

00:28:13.710 --> 00:28:15.460
But that statement
disappears when

00:28:15.460 --> 00:28:17.730
the particle becomes massless.

00:28:17.730 --> 00:28:19.350
So when the particle
becomes massless,

00:28:19.350 --> 00:28:22.470
essentially, each spin state
is its own kind of particle.

00:28:22.470 --> 00:28:25.360
And it might be part of a
spectrum of real particles,

00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:26.770
or might not.

00:28:26.770 --> 00:28:29.230
And we don't know any
fundamental principle

00:28:29.230 --> 00:28:31.700
that answers that question,
other than experiment.

00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:48.890
OK.

00:28:48.890 --> 00:28:50.264
So I was just
going to write down

00:28:50.264 --> 00:28:52.560
a g for e plus, e minus pairs.

00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:55.775
Remember this g determines the
energy density, the pressure,

00:28:55.775 --> 00:28:56.775
and the entropy density.

00:28:59.380 --> 00:29:04.860
And it again has a factor of
7/8 because these are fermions.

00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:15.710
It has a factor of one to sort
of follow the general pattern

00:29:15.710 --> 00:29:18.960
because there's only one
species of electrons.

00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:23.800
For neutrinos we had three, but
for electrons we just have one.

00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:27.140
We do get a factor
of two for particles,

00:29:27.140 --> 00:29:30.850
anti particles because an e plus
is different from an e minus.

00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:44.335
And there are two spin
states for the electron.

00:29:44.335 --> 00:29:47.430
If could be spin up, or spin
down, or spin equals 1/2,

00:29:47.430 --> 00:29:49.050
and there's spin
equals minus 1/2.

00:29:49.050 --> 00:29:50.750
So there are two spin states.

00:29:55.570 --> 00:29:59.625
And that gives us a
factor of 7/2 for g.

00:30:03.670 --> 00:30:12.960
And for g star e plus, e minus,
the only difference again,

00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:20.825
is in the first factor, which
is 3/4 for fermions for g star.

00:30:23.550 --> 00:30:27.970
And then times dot, dot, dot.

00:30:27.970 --> 00:30:32.060
And that then is equal to just
a nice round factor of three.

00:30:36.380 --> 00:30:41.800
And then if we go back
to this earlier time,

00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:44.150
we have not only the
e plus, e minus pairs,

00:30:44.150 --> 00:30:47.430
which started to exist when
we crossed this threshold,

00:30:47.430 --> 00:30:49.530
we also have photons
and neutrinos.

00:30:57.440 --> 00:31:02.840
So for kt, large
compared to m sub ec

00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:15.500
squared, and I should say small
compared to the next threshold,

00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:21.280
m sub nu c squared,
mass of a muon.

00:31:24.291 --> 00:31:27.790
The mass of the muon as
106 MeV Mass of electron

00:31:27.790 --> 00:31:28.670
is a half of an MeV.

00:31:28.670 --> 00:31:31.670
So there's are good
long range here where

00:31:31.670 --> 00:31:32.740
this is the right number.

00:31:37.030 --> 00:31:49.090
So g total is equal to
2 plus 21/4 plus 7/2

00:31:49.090 --> 00:31:55.440
equals 10 and 3/4.

00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:57.950
So this number 10 and 3/4
plays an important role

00:31:57.950 --> 00:32:01.030
in a long segment of the
history of our universe.

00:32:57.684 --> 00:32:59.600
Another number that you
might be interested in

00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:03.090
is the energy density of
radiation in the universe

00:33:03.090 --> 00:33:05.840
today.

00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:08.860
And the e plus, e minus
pairs are of course

00:33:08.860 --> 00:33:14.450
long since frozen out because
kt is a lot less than half

00:33:14.450 --> 00:33:17.160
of an MeV.

00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:21.334
So we just have
neutrinos and photons.

00:33:21.334 --> 00:33:22.750
You might think
that we could just

00:33:22.750 --> 00:33:27.570
add the formulas for photons
to the formula for neutrinos,

00:33:27.570 --> 00:33:29.920
but that turns out
not to be right.

00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:32.860
And the reason
it's not right now

00:33:32.860 --> 00:33:37.700
is that we believe that the
temperature of the neutrinos

00:33:37.700 --> 00:33:41.820
is not the same as the
temperature of the photons.

00:33:41.820 --> 00:33:43.400
And this is a
problem that you'll

00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:45.290
be working out on the
next homework set,

00:33:45.290 --> 00:33:47.640
so I won't give all
the details here

00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:51.260
because I want you to have
the fun of working out

00:33:51.260 --> 00:33:52.420
those details.

00:33:52.420 --> 00:33:54.650
But I'll tell you the
outline of what it is.

00:33:54.650 --> 00:34:00.040
The transition occurs
when kt crosses

00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:02.080
this magic threshold
of m sub e c

00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:06.110
squared, which means that the
electron positron pairs are

00:34:06.110 --> 00:34:11.460
going to start to disappear from
the thermal equilibrium mix.

00:34:11.460 --> 00:34:12.940
Now those electron
positron pairs

00:34:12.940 --> 00:34:16.139
have both energy and entropy.

00:34:16.139 --> 00:34:20.639
It turns out that the energy
is very hard to keep track of.

00:34:20.639 --> 00:34:24.800
And the reason why
that is true is

00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:38.949
that we know that du dt is equal
to minus 3h, times rho plus p,

00:34:38.949 --> 00:34:41.620
I think i have this right.

00:34:41.620 --> 00:34:42.120
times u.

00:34:44.639 --> 00:34:46.780
No, not times u.

00:34:46.780 --> 00:34:47.909
And this might be a u.

00:34:51.650 --> 00:34:53.770
Yeah, I think this is right.

00:34:53.770 --> 00:34:57.160
But what is definitely
true is that it involves

00:34:57.160 --> 00:34:59.344
the pressure as well
as the energy density.

00:34:59.344 --> 00:35:01.010
And keeping track of
what the pressure's

00:35:01.010 --> 00:35:02.620
doing as a function
of time is complicated

00:35:02.620 --> 00:35:04.870
because depending on exactly
what the mix of particles

00:35:04.870 --> 00:35:07.590
are and the pressure
is even given

00:35:07.590 --> 00:35:09.820
by a more complicated
formula when you're

00:35:09.820 --> 00:35:11.560
very near the
threshold, that is when

00:35:11.560 --> 00:35:13.970
kt is near the
mass of a particle,

00:35:13.970 --> 00:35:18.040
there's a more complicated
formula for the pressure.

00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:20.890
So the pressure is
hard to keep track of.

00:35:20.890 --> 00:35:24.800
But the entropy turns out
to be easy to keep track

00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:29.620
of because entropy is simply
conserved during this process.

00:35:29.620 --> 00:35:33.510
So on the problem that you'll be
doing for the next problem set

00:35:33.510 --> 00:35:38.280
you'll be looking at the entropy
contained in these e plus

00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:40.340
e minus pairs.

00:35:40.340 --> 00:35:42.720
And then there's an important
assumption which is valid.

00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:45.610
We will not really
try to justify it,

00:35:45.610 --> 00:35:49.450
but at the time when the e
plus, e minus pairs go out

00:35:49.450 --> 00:35:51.480
of equilibrium,
when they disappear

00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:55.120
from the thermal equilibrium
mix as kt falls below m sub

00:35:55.120 --> 00:36:00.930
ec squared, at that point the
photons are still interacting

00:36:00.930 --> 00:36:04.710
strongly with everything
else, and with each other.

00:36:04.710 --> 00:36:06.770
But the neutrinos have
pretty much decoupled.

00:36:06.770 --> 00:36:09.880
They're not really interacting
with anything anymore.

00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:11.570
So when the e
plus, e minus pairs

00:36:11.570 --> 00:36:13.880
disappear they give
essentially all

00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:16.810
of their entropy to the
photons, and essentially not

00:36:16.810 --> 00:36:23.069
of their entropy
to the neutrinos.

00:36:23.069 --> 00:36:24.610
And that means that
you can calculate

00:36:24.610 --> 00:36:26.690
the entropy density
of the photons,

00:36:26.690 --> 00:36:30.676
and the entropy density
of the neutrinos

00:36:30.676 --> 00:36:33.050
and you can calculate from
that the relative temperatures

00:36:33.050 --> 00:36:34.520
between the two.

00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:36.560
And the net effect is
that the photons end up

00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:38.435
with a higher temperature
than the neutrinos.

00:36:41.010 --> 00:36:44.720
So cosmology makes a
clear prediction here.

00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:46.330
The universe today
should be bathed

00:36:46.330 --> 00:36:49.590
in a thermal distribution
of neutrinos.

00:36:49.590 --> 00:36:53.090
The temperature I think ends up
being about 2.4 degrees Kelvin,

00:36:53.090 --> 00:36:57.490
a little colder
than the photons.

00:36:57.490 --> 00:36:59.530
And it's really
the great challenge

00:36:59.530 --> 00:37:01.090
of observational
cosmology to try

00:37:01.090 --> 00:37:03.640
to measure those
thermal neutrinos.

00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:06.270
Because neutrinos
interact so weakly,

00:37:06.270 --> 00:37:08.690
nobody has come
close to measuring

00:37:08.690 --> 00:37:10.780
the existence of
those neutrinos.

00:37:10.780 --> 00:37:12.580
Everybody thinks
they must be there,

00:37:12.580 --> 00:37:14.360
if anybody's discovers
they're not there,

00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:18.230
it'll be a major shift in our
understanding of cosmology.

00:37:18.230 --> 00:37:20.730
But nobody really knows
how to measure them.

00:37:20.730 --> 00:37:24.071
So you guys could try
to do that sometime

00:37:24.071 --> 00:37:25.445
during your career
as physicists.

00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:43.460
So putting these things
together what you'll show

00:37:43.460 --> 00:37:46.540
is that the temperature
of neutrinos

00:37:46.540 --> 00:37:51.700
should be equal
to 4/11 to the 1/3

00:37:51.700 --> 00:37:54.740
power times the
temperature of the photons.

00:38:01.050 --> 00:38:02.540
And given that,
we can write down

00:38:02.540 --> 00:38:05.705
a formula for the energy
density in radiation today.

00:38:12.870 --> 00:38:23.120
So u [? rad ?] 0 for today
is equal to g for photons,

00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:29.804
plus 21/4, which is
g for the neutrinos,

00:38:29.804 --> 00:38:31.470
but then we have to
correct for the fact

00:38:31.470 --> 00:38:33.470
that the neutrinos are
at the lower temperature,

00:38:33.470 --> 00:38:35.890
and remember energy density's
go like the fourth power

00:38:35.890 --> 00:38:36.692
of the temperature.

00:38:36.692 --> 00:38:38.150
So there's a
correction here, which

00:38:38.150 --> 00:38:41.730
is the fourth
power of this 4/11.

00:38:41.730 --> 00:38:49.580
So this multiplies
4/11 to the 4/3 power,

00:38:49.580 --> 00:38:51.080
the fourth power
of the temperature.

00:38:54.860 --> 00:38:57.810
And then the rest of the
formula for energy density.

00:38:57.810 --> 00:39:04.560
Pi squared over 30 times
k, times the temperature

00:39:04.560 --> 00:39:10.880
of the photons to the fourth
power, divided by h bar

00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:16.820
c cubed.

00:39:16.820 --> 00:39:20.360
And if you plug
numbers into this,

00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:22.730
you get a number which I
wrote on the blackboard

00:39:22.730 --> 00:39:26.470
when we started talking about
radiation for the radiation

00:39:26.470 --> 00:39:28.190
density of today's universe.

00:39:28.190 --> 00:39:39.235
It's 7.01 times 10 to the minus
14 jewels per meter cubed.

00:39:48.282 --> 00:39:50.740
So now we know how to derive
this formula that I pulled out

00:39:50.740 --> 00:39:54.160
out of hat when we first started
talking about energy density

00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:55.947
radiation.

00:39:55.947 --> 00:39:57.780
You might remember we
used this to calculate

00:39:57.780 --> 00:39:59.840
when radiation matter
equality took place.

00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:16.420
OK.

00:40:16.420 --> 00:40:17.530
Any questions about this?

00:40:21.001 --> 00:40:21.500
OK.

00:40:21.500 --> 00:40:23.430
Well in that case now I'm
ready to come back and talk

00:40:23.430 --> 00:40:25.138
about neutrino masses
more realistically.

00:40:50.064 --> 00:40:52.830
OK. [INAUDIBLE] the
mass we now know.

00:40:52.830 --> 00:40:55.770
Or at least two out
of the three do.

00:40:55.770 --> 00:41:00.900
And still I argued, or
told you, that the mass

00:41:00.900 --> 00:41:03.169
didn't matter for the
calculations we just did.

00:41:03.169 --> 00:41:05.460
And that seems a little
strange because the calculation

00:41:05.460 --> 00:41:08.250
we just did depended on counting
the numbers of spin states,

00:41:08.250 --> 00:41:09.958
and the number of spin
states, of course,

00:41:09.958 --> 00:41:12.690
changes if the
particles have a mass.

00:41:12.690 --> 00:41:16.880
Neutrinos could not
have just one spin state

00:41:16.880 --> 00:41:19.050
if they had a mass.

00:41:19.050 --> 00:41:22.370
So the question
then is what happens

00:41:22.370 --> 00:41:25.017
to these right-handed neutrinos.

00:41:25.017 --> 00:41:27.350
Remember the neutrinos we
know and love are left-handed.

00:42:04.712 --> 00:42:05.230
OK.

00:42:05.230 --> 00:42:10.170
Nobody has ever seen a
right-handed neutrino.

00:42:10.170 --> 00:42:12.792
But if the neutrino has
a mass, they must exist.

00:42:12.792 --> 00:42:14.250
And one way to see
is that argument

00:42:14.250 --> 00:42:16.083
I gave you about catching
up to the neutrino

00:42:16.083 --> 00:42:17.242
and going faster than it.

00:42:17.242 --> 00:42:18.700
And then a left-hand
neutrino would

00:42:18.700 --> 00:42:20.770
turn into a right-handed
neutrino, which

00:42:20.770 --> 00:42:24.080
is, this is all you
did, was change frames,

00:42:24.080 --> 00:42:26.020
and the world is
Lorentz invariant.

00:42:26.020 --> 00:42:29.450
It means that right-handed
neutrinos must in principle

00:42:29.450 --> 00:42:30.870
exist in any frame.

00:42:38.630 --> 00:42:39.130
OK.

00:42:39.130 --> 00:42:41.400
It turns out that
there are two theories

00:42:41.400 --> 00:42:43.360
of how the neutrino mass works.

00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:46.175
And we don't know yet which
of these theories is correct.

00:42:57.110 --> 00:43:05.310
And they are called the
possibility of a Dirac mass

00:43:05.310 --> 00:43:07.815
or the possibility
of a Majorana mass.

00:43:16.810 --> 00:43:19.280
And these are both
named after people,

00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:22.280
so don't try to parse anything
about the physical meaning

00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:24.300
of those words from the name.

00:43:27.150 --> 00:43:29.950
The Dirac mass is
the easier one for us

00:43:29.950 --> 00:43:32.550
to understand because
it's the same kind of mass

00:43:32.550 --> 00:43:35.900
that an electron has.

00:43:35.900 --> 00:43:39.940
So if the neutrinos
have a Dirac mass

00:43:39.940 --> 00:43:43.880
it really would mean that there
are right-handed neutrinos,

00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:45.692
which are a new
species a particle

00:43:45.692 --> 00:43:47.150
that we haven't
seen yet, but which

00:43:47.150 --> 00:43:51.410
would be implied by the
existence of this mass.

00:43:51.410 --> 00:43:55.080
The catch is that because
of the very peculiar way

00:43:55.080 --> 00:43:57.790
that the neutrinos
interact it is

00:43:57.790 --> 00:44:00.830
possible for the
right-handed neutrinos

00:44:00.830 --> 00:44:04.556
to interact vastly more weakly
than the left handed neutrinos.

00:44:04.556 --> 00:44:05.930
And that would be
the explanation

00:44:05.930 --> 00:44:08.500
for why we've never seen
them because they interact

00:44:08.500 --> 00:44:10.550
so extraordinarily weakly.

00:44:10.550 --> 00:44:13.570
And even in the early universe
where everything almost reaches

00:44:13.570 --> 00:44:16.210
thermal equilibrium,
the cross-section

00:44:16.210 --> 00:44:18.350
for producing
right-handed neutrinos

00:44:18.350 --> 00:44:21.405
would be so small that they
would essentially never

00:44:21.405 --> 00:44:21.905
be produced.

00:44:45.750 --> 00:45:06.900
So right-handed nu's
interact so weakly

00:45:06.900 --> 00:45:22.640
that they're not seen in
lab, or in early universe.

00:45:38.395 --> 00:45:38.895
OK.

00:45:38.895 --> 00:45:40.228
The other type is more peculiar.

00:45:46.260 --> 00:45:48.330
And there are no other
particles in nature

00:45:48.330 --> 00:45:50.290
that are known to have
this type of mass,

00:45:50.290 --> 00:45:54.190
but it's a theoretical
possibility.

00:45:54.190 --> 00:45:56.480
Majorana masses can
only be possessed

00:45:56.480 --> 00:46:00.940
by particles which are neutral,
but neutrinos are neutral.

00:46:00.940 --> 00:46:05.330
And if neutrinos
have a Majorana mass

00:46:05.330 --> 00:46:08.400
it would mean that the
right-handed partner

00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:11.620
of the left handed
neutrinos that we see

00:46:11.620 --> 00:46:14.090
would in fact be a particle
that we already know about,

00:46:14.090 --> 00:46:16.214
but it will be the particle
that we have previously

00:46:16.214 --> 00:46:19.820
identified as the
right-handed anti neutrino.

00:46:19.820 --> 00:46:22.860
So if the Majorana
hypothesis is true,

00:46:22.860 --> 00:46:24.450
the anti neutrino
and the neutrino

00:46:24.450 --> 00:46:26.072
would be the same particle.

00:46:26.072 --> 00:46:27.780
And one would be the
right-handed version

00:46:27.780 --> 00:46:29.738
and the other would be
the left-handed version.

00:46:51.950 --> 00:46:54.280
And that is also a
possibility, we just know know.

00:46:57.370 --> 00:46:58.860
And in this case,
clearly what we

00:46:58.860 --> 00:47:00.120
said about the
early universe still

00:47:00.120 --> 00:47:01.786
works because we did
the counting right.

00:47:04.170 --> 00:47:05.880
If it's the direct
possibility we

00:47:05.880 --> 00:47:07.390
would have to do a
further argument,

00:47:07.390 --> 00:47:11.129
we justify the fact that these
right-handed partners interact

00:47:11.129 --> 00:47:12.920
so weakly that we would
never see them even

00:47:12.920 --> 00:47:16.240
in the early universe,
but that is the case.

00:47:16.240 --> 00:47:18.420
And for the Majorana
case there clearly

00:47:18.420 --> 00:47:21.890
is no real difference from
the calculations that we did.

00:47:21.890 --> 00:47:25.220
Any questions about that?

00:47:25.220 --> 00:47:25.900
Yes?

00:47:25.900 --> 00:47:27.316
AUDIENCE: What
exactly do you mean

00:47:27.316 --> 00:47:31.552
when you say the direct
mass is like the electrons?

00:47:31.552 --> 00:47:32.260
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:47:34.830 --> 00:47:38.500
What I mean is that it appears
in the equations of motion

00:47:38.500 --> 00:47:42.700
in the same way that the that
the electron mass appears,

00:47:42.700 --> 00:47:47.555
and therefore like the electron
there's a right-handed electron

00:47:47.555 --> 00:47:51.279
and there's also a left-handed
handed electron, which are just

00:47:51.279 --> 00:47:53.320
related to each other by
a parity transformation.

00:48:00.670 --> 00:48:02.002
Yes?

00:48:02.002 --> 00:48:10.349
AUDIENCE: Is it not a problem
in the Majorana case [INAUDIBLE]

00:48:10.349 --> 00:48:12.804
particle?

00:48:12.804 --> 00:48:15.937
Doesn't there have
to be an [INAUDIBLE]?

00:48:15.937 --> 00:48:16.520
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:48:16.520 --> 00:48:17.520
The question is
doesn't there have

00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:19.353
to be an anti particle,
how can the neutrino

00:48:19.353 --> 00:48:22.730
and the anti neutrino
be the same particle.

00:48:22.730 --> 00:48:24.190
The answer is no.

00:48:24.190 --> 00:48:26.780
The photon does not
have an anti particle.

00:48:26.780 --> 00:48:28.920
So particles that have
a charge of any kind

00:48:28.920 --> 00:48:31.700
must have an anti particle,
but if the particle is really

00:48:31.700 --> 00:48:35.147
neutral then it can just
be it's own anti particle,

00:48:35.147 --> 00:48:36.480
and that would be the case here.

00:48:39.030 --> 00:48:39.777
Yes?

00:48:39.777 --> 00:48:41.360
AUDIENCE: Sorry, I
have two questions.

00:48:41.360 --> 00:48:45.330
One is what is the
difference between a neutrino

00:48:45.330 --> 00:48:47.420
and a anti neutrino besides?

00:48:47.420 --> 00:48:49.870
I mean, how do we know
they're the same, that they

00:48:49.870 --> 00:48:51.392
are the same
particle [INAUDIBLE].

00:48:51.392 --> 00:48:52.891
It's not just a
matter of semantics.

00:48:52.891 --> 00:48:58.111
If the only difference that
we can see is [INAUDIBLE].

00:48:58.111 --> 00:48:59.610
Whether we call it
the anti neutrino

00:48:59.610 --> 00:49:03.870
or say that it's the same
particle, just [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:03.870 --> 00:49:04.630
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:49:04.630 --> 00:49:05.130
OK.

00:49:05.130 --> 00:49:08.340
You're saying how do we know
whether the anti neutrino was

00:49:08.340 --> 00:49:10.656
the same particle
as the neutrino,

00:49:10.656 --> 00:49:12.530
and what do we mean by
that statement anyway.

00:49:15.850 --> 00:49:21.340
I guess the answer is really
something that comes out

00:49:21.340 --> 00:49:24.230
of the fundamental equations
in the context of the quantum

00:49:24.230 --> 00:49:26.220
field theory.

00:49:26.220 --> 00:49:35.680
But maybe I can say something
more concrete, however.

00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:40.925
There's a quantum number
called Lepton number,

00:49:40.925 --> 00:49:43.300
and actually divides into
three kinds of quantum numbers,

00:49:43.300 --> 00:49:47.910
so there's an electron number,
muon number, and a tau number.

00:49:47.910 --> 00:49:49.940
And for all the
interactions that we've

00:49:49.940 --> 00:49:53.480
seen that number is
conserved, that is

00:49:53.480 --> 00:49:55.340
the sum of the
number of electrons

00:49:55.340 --> 00:49:57.340
minus the number
of anti electrons,

00:49:57.340 --> 00:49:59.500
plus the number of
electron neutrinos,

00:49:59.500 --> 00:50:02.330
minus the number of
anti electron neutrinos

00:50:02.330 --> 00:50:03.740
is conserved.

00:50:03.740 --> 00:50:06.670
And if that were a rigorous
conservation law, then

00:50:06.670 --> 00:50:09.250
it would really mean that
the neutrino was not neutral.

00:50:09.250 --> 00:50:11.440
It would have this
nonzero charge

00:50:11.440 --> 00:50:15.190
called electron charge
for the electron neutrino.

00:50:15.190 --> 00:50:20.160
So the Majorana
possibility requires

00:50:20.160 --> 00:50:25.580
that that quantity is
not really conserved.

00:50:25.580 --> 00:50:28.440
So that's an important
fact about nature

00:50:28.440 --> 00:50:30.690
that we haven't really
learned yet, whether or not

00:50:30.690 --> 00:50:33.880
it's exactly conserved or only
highly approximately conserved.

00:50:33.880 --> 00:50:36.830
The belief is that it's only
highly approximately conserved,

00:50:36.830 --> 00:50:40.080
but we don't know.

00:50:40.080 --> 00:50:40.580
Yes?

00:50:40.580 --> 00:50:42.163
AUDIENCE: Does a
neutrino [INAUDIBLE]?

00:50:47.610 --> 00:50:48.470
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:50:48.470 --> 00:50:49.290
You are right.

00:50:49.290 --> 00:50:50.510
You're very quick.

00:50:50.510 --> 00:50:53.551
You are right that neutrino
oscillations are certainly

00:50:53.551 --> 00:50:55.800
enough to prove that the
individual Lepton numbers are

00:50:55.800 --> 00:50:58.640
not conserved, but they
still have the possibility

00:50:58.640 --> 00:51:00.932
that total Lepton
number can be conserved,

00:51:00.932 --> 00:51:02.390
which we don't
think is true, but I

00:51:02.390 --> 00:51:04.140
don't think we've ruled
it out yet either.

00:51:07.342 --> 00:51:08.175
Any other questions?

00:51:12.070 --> 00:51:12.804
Yes?

00:51:12.804 --> 00:51:17.040
AUDIENCE: In the Majorana case,
if they are the same particle,

00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:20.930
do they still come in left
and right-handed forms

00:51:20.930 --> 00:51:25.196
so as to keep the
[INAUDIBLE] the same value,

00:51:25.196 --> 00:51:28.633
or do they only come in
the left-handed phase,

00:51:28.633 --> 00:51:32.259
in which case the [INAUDIBLE]
would be decreased [INAUDIBLE]?

00:51:32.259 --> 00:51:33.800
PROFESSOR: Well,
the counting that we

00:51:33.800 --> 00:51:36.310
had before would be correct.

00:51:36.310 --> 00:51:42.120
And the only question is
whether the factor of two

00:51:42.120 --> 00:51:44.810
that we put here for
particle, anti particle

00:51:44.810 --> 00:51:47.170
is here where maybe the
particle's really neutral

00:51:47.170 --> 00:51:49.400
and the factor of two is
the number of spin states,

00:51:49.400 --> 00:51:51.272
but it's the same
result either way.

00:51:51.272 --> 00:51:52.730
It's all in the
question of whether

00:51:52.730 --> 00:51:55.740
the left-handed neutrino
is the anti particle

00:51:55.740 --> 00:51:57.800
or the right-handed
neutrino, or another spin

00:51:57.800 --> 00:51:59.221
state of the right-handed.

00:51:59.221 --> 00:51:59.720
I'm sorry.

00:51:59.720 --> 00:52:01.350
I'm saying this wrong.

00:52:01.350 --> 00:52:03.440
The question is whether
the right-handed neutrino

00:52:03.440 --> 00:52:06.210
is the anti particle of
the left-handed neutrino

00:52:06.210 --> 00:52:09.230
or whether it's
another spin states

00:52:09.230 --> 00:52:10.837
of the left-handed neutrino.

00:52:10.837 --> 00:52:13.170
But either way the number
particles that we think exists

00:52:13.170 --> 00:52:15.086
would be the same in the
mayorana description.

00:52:20.570 --> 00:52:21.070
OK?

00:52:40.860 --> 00:52:41.360
OK.

00:52:41.360 --> 00:52:43.340
Now we're ready to
actually write down

00:52:43.340 --> 00:52:46.685
for example a formula for kt.

00:52:55.300 --> 00:53:03.870
So sticking to this time range
of kt is much, much bigger

00:53:03.870 --> 00:53:10.090
than m sub eb squared,
but kt is much, much less

00:53:10.090 --> 00:53:14.660
than m sub nu c squared.

00:53:14.660 --> 00:53:17.310
We can write down a
formula-- I'm sorry.

00:53:17.310 --> 00:53:18.810
Actually the formula's
more general.

00:53:18.810 --> 00:53:21.840
I didn't really look
carefully what I wrote.

00:53:21.840 --> 00:53:22.389
Forget this.

00:53:22.389 --> 00:53:24.930
As long as we know what little
g is, and this formula's going

00:53:24.930 --> 00:53:26.346
to have a little
g in it, and then

00:53:26.346 --> 00:53:29.210
you can fill in the right value
for any time period you want.

00:53:29.210 --> 00:53:32.670
We can write down a formula
for kt as a function of time.

00:53:32.670 --> 00:53:34.350
And that's because
we've learned how

00:53:34.350 --> 00:53:37.287
to write energy density
as a function of time,

00:53:37.287 --> 00:53:39.620
and we've learned how to
express energy density in terms

00:53:39.620 --> 00:53:40.810
of the temperature.

00:53:40.810 --> 00:53:42.630
And putting those
two together gives us

00:53:42.630 --> 00:53:45.040
a formula for the temperature
as a function of time.

00:53:45.040 --> 00:53:57.300
And that formula has the form of
45 h bar cubed c to the fifth,

00:53:57.300 --> 00:54:05.230
divided by 16 pi cubed
little g times capital

00:54:05.230 --> 00:54:11.550
G, Newton's constant, whole
thing to the 1/4 power, times 1

00:54:11.550 --> 00:54:13.030
over the square root of t.

00:54:19.770 --> 00:54:21.500
So if we had nothing
but radiation,

00:54:21.500 --> 00:54:24.010
and if little g
were constant, this

00:54:24.010 --> 00:54:25.980
would be the formula
for the temperature

00:54:25.980 --> 00:54:28.600
as a function of time.

00:54:28.600 --> 00:54:31.210
Now what actually
happens is that little g

00:54:31.210 --> 00:54:34.720
changes as we go through these
different thresholds for which

00:54:34.720 --> 00:54:37.639
particles are contributing
to the black-body radiation.

00:54:37.639 --> 00:54:39.180
And that means that
the exact formula

00:54:39.180 --> 00:54:41.980
is a little bit more
complicated than this.

00:54:41.980 --> 00:54:44.910
But as long as you're well
into any one of these periods,

00:54:44.910 --> 00:54:47.790
as long as you're not near
any of these border lines,

00:54:47.790 --> 00:54:51.900
this formula is in fact a
very accurate approximation

00:54:51.900 --> 00:54:55.940
to the temperature as
a function of time.

00:54:55.940 --> 00:55:00.380
And an interesting time
period is about one second

00:55:00.380 --> 00:55:01.400
after the Big Bang.

00:55:22.148 --> 00:55:29.440
And that corresponds to
this g equals 10 and 3/4

00:55:29.440 --> 00:55:32.510
that we talked about earlier,
where we have neutrinos

00:55:32.510 --> 00:55:35.040
e plus, e minus
pairs, and photons.

00:55:35.040 --> 00:55:37.340
And since this is before the
e plus, e minus pairs have

00:55:37.340 --> 00:55:39.870
disappeared, the temperature
of the neutrinos at this stage

00:55:39.870 --> 00:55:42.450
is still the same as the
temperature of the photon.

00:55:42.450 --> 00:55:45.040
So everything is at the
same temperature here.

00:55:45.040 --> 00:55:47.700
We just add up the g's.

00:55:47.700 --> 00:56:08.210
And the end result for that is
that kt is equal to 0.860 MeV

00:56:08.210 --> 00:56:16.240
million electron volts,
divided by the square root of t

00:56:16.240 --> 00:56:16.750
in seconds.

00:56:22.756 --> 00:56:24.630
There are the units that
you could express it

00:56:24.630 --> 00:56:25.860
in in the notes.

00:56:25.860 --> 00:56:28.300
Other sets of units are given.

00:56:28.300 --> 00:56:32.670
So if 0.86 is about 1, which
it is for many purposes,

00:56:32.670 --> 00:56:34.730
then roughly speaking
we're saying at 1 second

00:56:34.730 --> 00:56:38.739
after the Big Bang,
kt was about one MeV,

00:56:38.739 --> 00:56:40.280
which means it's
higher than the rest

00:56:40.280 --> 00:56:43.136
mass of the electrons,
which is 1/2 MeV.

00:56:43.136 --> 00:56:45.750
So the electron positron pairs
were still pretty much present

00:56:45.750 --> 00:56:47.700
at one second
after the Big Bang,

00:56:47.700 --> 00:56:49.930
but they start to disappear
pretty much immediately

00:56:49.930 --> 00:56:50.630
after that.

00:56:56.970 --> 00:57:00.270
One can also write down what
the temperature itself is.

00:57:00.270 --> 00:57:13.390
The temperature is 9.98 times
10 to the ninth k, divided

00:57:13.390 --> 00:57:15.210
by the square root
of t in seconds.

00:58:24.770 --> 00:58:25.300
OK.

00:58:25.300 --> 00:58:27.490
The next item we want
to talk about following

00:58:27.490 --> 00:58:29.460
the history of
the early universe

00:58:29.460 --> 00:58:34.250
is recombination and decoupling.

00:58:43.850 --> 00:58:46.880
Until the temperature
fell to about 4,000

00:58:46.880 --> 00:58:50.610
Kelvin, the hydrogen in the
universe, and the universe

00:58:50.610 --> 00:58:55.510
was mostly hydrogen, about 20%
helium and the rest hydrogen,

00:58:55.510 --> 00:58:59.390
and until the temperature
fell to 4,000 Kelvin,

00:58:59.390 --> 00:59:02.800
the hydrogen would be ionized.

00:59:02.800 --> 00:59:04.800
This is another
[? stat net ?] calculation

00:59:04.800 --> 00:59:07.280
that we're not
going to be doing.

00:59:07.280 --> 00:59:09.610
4,000 degrees is not
some magic temperature

00:59:09.610 --> 00:59:11.510
associated with hydrogen.

00:59:11.510 --> 00:59:13.310
The point at which
the hydrogen ionizers

00:59:13.310 --> 00:59:15.350
depends on its density.

00:59:15.350 --> 00:59:18.090
But for the densities
in the early universe,

00:59:18.090 --> 00:59:22.420
the ionization point
is about 4,000 Kelvin.

00:59:22.420 --> 00:59:43.750
So at t equals 4,000 Kelvin
the hydrogen recombines.

00:59:49.745 --> 00:59:52.270
Now the word
recombine has somehow

00:59:52.270 --> 00:59:55.340
historically taken hold.

00:59:55.340 --> 00:59:57.239
So everybody calls
it recombination

00:59:57.239 --> 00:59:59.280
in spite of the fact that
according to our theory

00:59:59.280 --> 01:00:02.320
it was never combined
previously at any time.

01:00:02.320 --> 01:00:05.919
So the prefix re there has
absolutely no meaning whatever,

01:00:05.919 --> 01:00:07.835
but nonetheless it is
completely conventional.

01:00:51.110 --> 01:00:51.610
OK.

01:00:51.610 --> 01:00:55.280
To estimate when
this happens we can

01:00:55.280 --> 01:00:59.040
use an important fact,
which we haven't said yet.

01:00:59.040 --> 01:01:12.440
Because entropy is conserved
and entropy density

01:01:12.440 --> 01:01:20.630
is equal to some
constant times t cubed,

01:01:20.630 --> 01:01:28.570
if entropy is conserved
then like mass density

01:01:28.570 --> 01:01:31.790
in a matter-dominated universe,
as the universe expands,

01:01:31.790 --> 01:01:33.460
the entropy thins out.

01:01:33.460 --> 01:01:35.430
And therefore just
like the mass density

01:01:35.430 --> 01:01:38.260
in a matter-dominated
universe, the density

01:01:38.260 --> 01:01:40.680
should go down like 1 over
a cubed, 1 over the volume.

01:02:00.840 --> 01:02:03.145
Now strictly speaking this
is only true if g is fixed.

01:02:09.267 --> 01:02:10.600
Well, actually that's not right.

01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:13.220
It's always true.

01:02:13.220 --> 01:02:17.230
What I'm about to write next
is only true if g is fixed.

01:02:17.230 --> 01:02:32.770
If g is fixed then
entropy density

01:02:32.770 --> 01:02:34.620
is proportional to
the temperature cubed.

01:02:41.270 --> 01:02:46.210
And if you put
these together you

01:02:46.210 --> 01:02:51.290
could see that t is
just proportional to 1

01:02:51.290 --> 01:02:52.340
over the scale factor.

01:02:56.610 --> 01:02:59.420
So as long as little g, as
long as the number of degrees

01:02:59.420 --> 01:03:02.707
of freedom contributing to this
black-body radiation is fixed,

01:03:02.707 --> 01:03:05.040
the temperature just falls
like 1 over the scale factor.

01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:16.420
OK.

01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:26.900
OK.

01:03:26.900 --> 01:03:30.417
So we said that recombination
occurs at 4,000 degrees.

01:03:30.417 --> 01:03:32.000
There's actually
another number that's

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:35.974
more interesting,
which is decoupling,

01:03:35.974 --> 01:03:37.015
which is slightly colder.

01:04:03.960 --> 01:04:09.410
Now the definitions are that
recombination is usually

01:04:09.410 --> 01:04:13.040
defined as the temperature
at which half of the hydrogen

01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:15.945
has recombined, but some
significant fraction of it

01:04:15.945 --> 01:04:17.450
is still not yet recombined.

01:04:17.450 --> 01:04:18.575
It doesn't happen suddenly.

01:04:18.575 --> 01:04:19.740
It happens gradually.

01:04:19.740 --> 01:04:21.600
So you have to pick
some point along the way

01:04:21.600 --> 01:04:25.520
to say this is the temperature
that defines the recombination.

01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:27.270
Usually take us to
the halfway point,

01:04:27.270 --> 01:04:30.000
which I think is the number
used to calculate that.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:34.040
But perhaps of more
interest is the temperature

01:04:34.040 --> 01:04:37.230
at which the photons
decouple in the sense

01:04:37.230 --> 01:04:39.890
that as the photons
scatter between then

01:04:39.890 --> 01:04:44.940
and now, a typical photon
has not scattered at all.

01:04:44.940 --> 01:04:48.530
And that's colder because
when you cross 4,000 K

01:04:48.530 --> 01:04:50.895
you still have half of the
hydrogen ionized, which

01:04:50.895 --> 01:04:52.520
means there's still
plenty of electrons

01:04:52.520 --> 01:04:55.220
around for these photons
to scatter off of.

01:04:55.220 --> 01:04:57.230
So you have to cool to
a colder temperature

01:04:57.230 --> 01:05:00.360
until the photons cease to
interact with the electron

01:05:00.360 --> 01:05:02.950
positrons in any
significant way.

01:05:02.950 --> 01:05:05.670
And that's why
decoupling temperature

01:05:05.670 --> 01:05:10.040
is somewhat lower than
recombination temperature.

01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:13.085
We can estimate at what
time decoupling happened.

01:06:01.656 --> 01:06:03.390
Now this is only
a crude estimate,

01:06:03.390 --> 01:06:06.260
but will in fact
be pretty accurate.

01:06:06.260 --> 01:06:09.020
Since we don't yet even
know about dark energy,

01:06:09.020 --> 01:06:12.060
we're going to estimate the
evolution of the universe

01:06:12.060 --> 01:06:15.990
between the time of decoupling
and now as being entirely

01:06:15.990 --> 01:06:17.550
matter-dominated.

01:06:17.550 --> 01:06:19.930
The time of decoupling
is long after the time

01:06:19.930 --> 01:06:22.097
of matter radiation equality.

01:06:22.097 --> 01:06:23.555
So the universe is
matter dominated

01:06:23.555 --> 01:06:25.292
at the time of
decoupling and we're

01:06:25.292 --> 01:06:26.958
going to assume it's
matter dominated up

01:06:26.958 --> 01:06:27.930
to the present day.

01:06:27.930 --> 01:06:32.960
And that means that we know that
the scale factor will evolve

01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:36.050
like t to the 2/3, and
therefore the temperature

01:06:36.050 --> 01:06:38.860
will evolve, like 1
over t to the 2/3.

01:06:38.860 --> 01:06:40.500
And that will be
enough to tell us

01:06:40.500 --> 01:06:44.160
how much time is needed
to go from 3,000 Kelvin

01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:48.450
to the present
temperature 2.7 Kelvin.

01:06:48.450 --> 01:06:53.070
So the time of decoupling
making this approximation

01:06:53.070 --> 01:06:56.350
is just the ratio
of the temperatures

01:06:56.350 --> 01:07:05.310
t zero over t decoupling,
to the 3/2 power,

01:07:05.310 --> 01:07:09.660
times the time today.

01:07:09.660 --> 01:07:13.270
[INAUDIBLE] this
fraction in the past.

01:07:13.270 --> 01:07:24.766
And plugging in numbers
that's 2.7 over 3,000

01:07:24.766 --> 01:07:39.450
to the 3/2 times
13.8 trillion years.

01:07:39.450 --> 01:07:47.461
And that's about 380,000 years.

01:07:47.461 --> 01:07:48.960
And this in fact
this is pretty much

01:07:48.960 --> 01:07:51.501
exactly the number that people
quote when they calculate this

01:07:51.501 --> 01:07:52.280
more accurately.

01:07:52.280 --> 01:07:56.050
So we really hit it
just about on the nose.

01:07:56.050 --> 01:07:58.950
So the time of decoupling
was about 400,000 years

01:07:58.950 --> 01:08:01.610
after the Big Bang.

01:08:01.610 --> 01:08:04.140
And I should add,
and then we'll stop,

01:08:04.140 --> 01:08:06.850
that when we look at the
cosmic background radiation,

01:08:06.850 --> 01:08:10.590
what we are really seeing is an
image of the universe at this

01:08:10.590 --> 01:08:15.360
time, at the time of decoupling,
because from this time onward

01:08:15.360 --> 01:08:18.636
photons have pretty much just
travelled in straight lines.

01:08:18.636 --> 01:08:21.010
And that means that when we
look at the cosmic background

01:08:21.010 --> 01:08:24.850
radiation we're really seeing
an image of the early universe

01:08:24.850 --> 01:08:27.229
in exactly the same way as
you're seeing an image of me

01:08:27.229 --> 01:08:29.979
when you observe the photons
there traveling from my face

01:08:29.979 --> 01:08:32.120
to your eyes along
straight lines.

01:08:32.120 --> 01:08:34.497
It's the same principle.

01:08:34.497 --> 01:08:36.080
So this determines
what we're actually

01:08:36.080 --> 01:08:38.279
seeing in the cosmic
background radiation.

01:08:38.279 --> 01:08:40.810
And therefore it's a very,
very important number.

01:08:40.810 --> 01:08:45.070
And we'll stop there now
and continue next time.

00:00:10.895 --> 00:00:12.020
JONATHAN GRUBER: All right.

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:13.215
Let's get started.

00:00:13.215 --> 00:00:15.090
Today, we're going to
continue our discussion

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:16.850
of international trade.

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.000
I want to finish up discussing
comparative advantage,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.180
and then we'll talk about
the welfare implications

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:25.190
of international
trade, and then how

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:27.410
that drives our thinking
about trade policy, one

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.010
of the hottest topics in
economics discussions today.

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:34.460
So let's finish our discussion
of comparative advantage

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.250
that we started last time.

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.970
Remember, the key lesson
from the PPF-type analysis

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:45.290
we had last time is that if
there's comparative advantage,

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:48.900
it can yield gains to trade
through specialization.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.690
So that's sort of
the key lesson,

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.010
is that comparative
advantage yields

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:02.190
gains from trade through the
mechanism of specialization.

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.160
So basically, because of
comparative advantage,

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.650
you can specialize, and that
means you can essentially

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:14.570
get an outward-bending PPF.

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.790
You can essentially
get economies of scope

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.560
by specializing and
combining your activities.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.587
Now, you don't literally
get economies of scope,

00:01:21.587 --> 00:01:23.420
because each person's
doing their own thing.

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.807
But it acts as if the
economy as a whole

00:01:25.807 --> 00:01:27.890
is yielding economies of
scope, because basically,

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.380
by specializing, you're
allowing the economy as a whole

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.080
to benefit from people
doing what they're best at.

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.070
So that's the basic
intuition of the economics

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.250
of why international
trade can yield gains.

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:40.880
OK?

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.950
Now, that raised the
natural question of, well,

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.438
where does comparative
advantage come from?

00:01:46.438 --> 00:01:48.480
Why do some countries have
comparative advantage?

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.930
We [INAUDIBLE] from me
versus LeBron James.

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.480
He's got better genes and he's
worked harder than I have.

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:57.958
But basically, when
it comes to countries,

00:01:57.958 --> 00:01:59.750
where does comparative
advantage come from?

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.540
And basically comes from,
roughly speaking, two sources.

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.640
The first source of comparative
advantage is factor endowments.

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.850
Some countries, just
through the nature

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.040
of geography and
geological history,

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.700
are endowed with things that
people want, and therefore

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.950
gives a comparative advantage
in trading those things.

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.060
So if you think
about Canada, Canada

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.970
is endowed with enormous
amounts of forested land,

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.780
and they've become a major
exporter of lumber and paper

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:33.980
products over time.

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.570
That's their
comparative advantage

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:39.690
because they happen to have
all this forested land around.

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.610
So for example, that's why most
clothing today comes from China

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:45.290
and less developed countries.

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.130
Because their factor
endowment is cheap labor.

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.290
It's not that they have
more natural textile threads

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.790
or whatever.

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.880
It's just they have
a cheap labor, which

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.500
is the primary factor which
goes into producing textiles.

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.670
So one source of comparative
advantage is factor endowments.

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:07.550
Now, once again, some country
could have more of everything.

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:09.800
Canada could have
cheap labor and lumber.

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.170
But the key point is in
the simple two-by-two world

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.120
we're thinking of, it's
all about relative,

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.203
comparative advantage.

00:03:15.203 --> 00:03:17.120
So it's the one that
have the most of relative

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.790
to other countries.

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:20.090
OK?

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.660
And the second source of
comparative advantage,

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.250
the second reason why some
countries acquire advantage

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:26.650
is technology.

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:32.990
So if you look at
Japan and cars,

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:35.793
Japan has no comparative
advantage of producing cars.

00:03:35.793 --> 00:03:38.210
It's not like they have more
of the raw products that make

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:41.190
steel than, say, the US does.

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:44.040
The difference is that
Japan was a leader

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.590
in developing the technology
of the modern automobile.

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:51.950
And that technological boost
gave the comparative advantage.

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:54.280
So factor endowments
are kind of natural.

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:59.500
Technology is a created source
of comparative advantage

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.650
that essentially, by
developing the technology,

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.010
you give yourself really sort
of a first mover advantage,

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.093
and are able to then
have leadership,

00:04:09.093 --> 00:04:11.260
have the relative comparative
advantage in producing

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:12.490
that good.

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:16.720
That's why, in some sense,
technology policy really

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:17.839
becomes trade policy.

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:20.470
And we'll talk about that
at the end of the lecture

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.200
when we talk about
trade policy in the US.

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.760
OK.

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:24.480
So that's really all.

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.330
I just want to finish up
on comparative advantage.

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.580
The main thing's the intuition
we developed last time,

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:31.630
but just want to highlight
also what competitive advantage

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:33.870
means and where it comes from.

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:36.470
What I really want
to focus on today

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:39.080
is the welfare implications
of the international trade,

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:43.730
and why economists are such big
fans of international trade.

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:46.310
So the welfare.

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:47.960
Welfare and trade.

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:52.560
And why do economists, in
simple diagrammatic form,

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:57.560
such strong proponents of
free international trade?

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.120
So to consider that, let's go
back to our example of roses,

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:03.610
and look at figure 19-1.

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:06.900
We have here a
simple representation

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.690
of the domestic
market for roses.

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:13.050
You've got a supply
curve and a demand curve.

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:16.770
And you yield your consumer
and producer surplus.

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:18.180
So let's say this is for the US.

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:19.800
You've got US
supply of roses, US

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.980
demand for roses, consumer
and producer surplus.

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:27.210
Now let's ask, what happens once
we allow international trade?

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:30.000
Once we allow for the
importation or exportation

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:30.945
of roses.

00:05:30.945 --> 00:05:33.320
Let's go to the next figure,
which is pretty complicated,

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:34.362
so let's walk through it.

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:41.620
Now we look at the rose
market with imports.

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:47.050
Now, the presence of
imports doesn't actually

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:49.610
change the nature of
demand and supply.

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:53.880
So the domestic or US demand and
supply curves are not shifted.

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:59.130
What imports do is effectively
increase the supply curve

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:02.070
of roses available
to US consumers

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:06.150
by adding roses from
other countries.

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:10.020
So what we do is to make this
work, what we basically--

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:12.420
the trick we use in
these models is we

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:15.510
essentially assume that
in international markets,

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:19.050
there's a perfectly
elastic supply of the good.

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:21.150
So what we say is
international trade creates

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:24.210
a perfectly elastic supply
of rose at the price

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:29.190
P sub W. That is, the price
used to be P sub A for autarky.

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:30.870
That's the price--
where domestic supply

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:32.227
hit domestic demand.

00:06:32.227 --> 00:06:34.560
We're going to assume that
what international trade does

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:38.940
is lower the price to P sub W
make supply perfectly elastic.

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:41.530
That is, the US can
get as many roses

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:45.020
as it wants at a price P sub W.

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:48.530
Now, for a small country,
this sort of makes sense.

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:51.500
For a small country,
essentially, they're

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:54.670
like a small producer in a
perfectly competitive market.

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:57.560
For the US, it might
not make so much sense.

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:01.070
The US is big enough
that it's hard to imagine

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:04.310
that we're price takers
with respect to anything.

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:07.370
We're the US, we
don't take any prices.

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:10.798
But in principle,
the basic intuition

00:07:10.798 --> 00:07:12.590
we get from this model
works, so we're just

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:16.348
going to treat US as a small
country for these purposes.

00:07:16.348 --> 00:07:17.765
And for something
like roses, it's

00:07:17.765 --> 00:07:19.490
probably not bad
to think of the US

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:22.760
as a price taker
in the rose market.

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:25.400
So it's a bit of a cheat
to say the US faces

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:27.830
perfectly elastic supply
in the world market,

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:30.650
but it's not a bad
cheat, and it doesn't

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:33.140
hurt the important
intuitions we'll derive.

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:35.840
So we're going to assume the US
faces a perfectly elastic world

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:38.730
supply at price P sub W.

00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:41.700
Now, what does this do?

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:45.600
What this does is, suddenly,
at that lower price P sub W,

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:51.820
consumers now want C sub T.
They want a lot more roses,

00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:54.810
because the price has fallen,
demand's downward sloping.

00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:59.790
But domestic producers want
to produce a lot fewer roses,

00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:02.040
since marginal cost
is upward sloping.

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:04.232
If you're going to force
the price down to P sub W,

00:08:04.232 --> 00:08:05.940
they don't want to
produce as many roses.

00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:08.980
They only want to
produce Q sub T.

00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:10.390
How do you resolve this?

00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:12.910
You resolve this
through imports.

00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:20.270
That the difference between Q
sub T and C sub T is imports.

00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:22.280
So the total amount
of roses consumed

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:27.420
does rise from Q sub A to C sub
T. The total amount of roses

00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:29.040
consumed does rise.

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:32.280
But the amount produced
domestically falls.

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:33.720
So both things are happening.

00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:36.450
Both US consumers are
consuming more roses,

00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:38.940
and US producers are
producing fewer roses.

00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:42.250
And the gap is
made up by imports.

00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:43.500
Kind of a complicated diagram.

00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:44.835
Are there questions about this?

00:08:44.835 --> 00:08:47.210
Because I'm going to build on
this diagram going forward.

00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:49.360
Any questions about
how this works?

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:50.170
OK.

00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:53.480
Now let's ask, what are
the welfare implications?

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:56.615
Let's go to figure 19-3.

00:08:56.615 --> 00:08:57.990
What are the
welfare implications

00:08:57.990 --> 00:08:59.730
to international trade?

00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:03.460
Well, the welfare implications
are, for consumers,

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:08.010
their surplus used to be--

00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:11.130
their surplus used
to be W. They used

00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:15.030
to get Q sub A roses
at a price P sub A.

00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:18.400
So their surplus used
to be the area W.

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:20.980
What is the surplus
of domestic consumers?

00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:23.170
Let me-- an important
point for welfare.

00:09:23.170 --> 00:09:27.690
We're going to look at
domestic welfare only.

00:09:27.690 --> 00:09:30.190
We'll come back later to caring
about the rest of the world,

00:09:30.190 --> 00:09:32.140
but for now, we only
care about the US.

00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:34.960
So when I talk about welfare,
unless I say otherwise,

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:36.880
I think about US welfare only.

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:38.830
US consumers, US producers.

00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:41.080
Very important to keep in
mind, because otherwise this

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:42.392
can get confusing.

00:09:42.392 --> 00:09:44.600
So for now we're talking
about domestic welfare only.

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:47.770
So for US consumers,
what has happened?

00:09:47.770 --> 00:09:52.520
They used to get a surplus of
W. What's their surplus now?

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:53.177
Yeah.

00:09:53.177 --> 00:09:54.285
AUDIENCE: X, W, and Z.

00:09:54.285 --> 00:09:55.160
JONATHAN GRUBER: Yes.

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:57.390
Z, by the way, is the
entire light purple area.

00:09:57.390 --> 00:09:59.390
It's confusing, because
there's this dotted line

00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:00.057
down the middle.

00:10:00.057 --> 00:10:01.580
Z's either side of
the dotted line.

00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:03.230
The entire triangle is Z.

00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:07.010
So consumers now get
W plus X plus Z. Why?

00:10:07.010 --> 00:10:09.800
Because they're consuming
C sub T at a price

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:12.690
P sub W. Don't let the other
complications in the graph

00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:13.190
confuse you.

00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:15.230
Remember, consumer
surplus is just the area

00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:17.603
below the demand
curve, above the price,

00:10:17.603 --> 00:10:18.770
at the equilibrium quantity.

00:10:18.770 --> 00:10:20.312
The new equilibrium
quantity consumed

00:10:20.312 --> 00:10:22.770
is C sub T. The new
price is P sub W, so they

00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:24.850
get that giant triangle.

00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:30.520
Producers used to have a
surplus of X plus Z. X plus Y,

00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:31.690
I'm sorry.

00:10:31.690 --> 00:10:35.980
Producers used to sell
Q sub A at a price P sub

00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:40.180
A. So the area above the
supply curve below the price

00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:42.070
was X plus Y.

00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:46.430
Now, X has been
transferred to consumers.

00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:51.450
So producer surplus has fallen
to Y. So what's happened?

00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:53.430
What's the opposite
of the deadweight loss

00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:55.290
diagrams we saw before?

00:10:55.290 --> 00:10:57.480
When we did things
like impose a tax,

00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:59.790
we transferred from
one group to another,

00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:01.810
creating deadweight loss.

00:11:01.810 --> 00:11:04.050
International trade is
the opposite effect.

00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:06.210
We've transferred from
one group to another

00:11:06.210 --> 00:11:10.530
and created social
gain for the US.

00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:12.920
US consumers have gained.

00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:17.650
And on net, US society is
better off by the area Z.

00:11:17.650 --> 00:11:19.330
And this, in the
terms of this course,

00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:22.180
is why economists like
international trade.

00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:25.130
That expands the
opportunity set.

00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:29.840
By allowing consumers to
get these cheaper goods,

00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:32.840
you raise consumer
surplus more than you

00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:35.180
lower producer surplus.

00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:37.190
And that's why we like
international trade.

00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:39.728
It's a net win for society.

00:11:39.728 --> 00:11:42.020
Now, different parties might
feel differently about it,

00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:43.560
and we'll come back to that.

00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:46.372
But let's just focus right
now on total social surplus.

00:11:46.372 --> 00:11:47.830
And for total social
surplus, which

00:11:47.830 --> 00:11:51.150
are defined as producer plus
consumers, we are better off.

00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:54.050
And that's why we like
international trade.

00:11:54.050 --> 00:11:55.027
OK?

00:11:55.027 --> 00:11:55.860
Question about that.

00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:56.390
Yeah.

00:11:56.390 --> 00:11:58.590
AUDIENCE: What is the
new producer surplus?

00:11:58.590 --> 00:12:00.632
JONATHAN GRUBER: The new
producer surplus is just

00:12:00.632 --> 00:12:03.525
Y. It used to be Y
plus X. So producers

00:12:03.525 --> 00:12:06.000
are losing X.
Consumers gain that X,

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.933
but consumers also
get Z. So it's

00:12:07.933 --> 00:12:09.600
sort of the flip side
of deadweight loss

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:10.750
we talked about before.

00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:12.750
You're transferring for
producers and consumers,

00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:14.167
but you're also
creating new gains

00:12:14.167 --> 00:12:15.860
for consumers along the way.

00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:17.400
OK?

00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:17.970
OK.

00:12:17.970 --> 00:12:19.290
So now, that's imports.

00:12:19.290 --> 00:12:20.640
What about exports?

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:22.710
Let's flip and think
about computers.

00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:27.420
Let's go to figure 19-4
and talk about computers.

00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:35.450
For computers, once again,
we start at point A.

00:12:35.450 --> 00:12:40.220
We start with computers under
autarky without trading.

00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:43.090
The price is where demand
equals supply, a P sub

00:12:43.090 --> 00:12:45.650
A, and the quantity's
Q sub A. And that's

00:12:45.650 --> 00:12:48.170
the initial equilibrium
for computers.

00:12:48.170 --> 00:12:50.430
Now we open up to trade.

00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:53.630
Well, what happens now, is
now, the rest of the world

00:12:53.630 --> 00:12:58.190
wants US computers, so the US
can sell at a higher price.

00:12:58.190 --> 00:13:01.250
Before, the US could only
sell to domestic consumers.

00:13:01.250 --> 00:13:04.190
But now, their demand
for their goods

00:13:04.190 --> 00:13:06.860
worldwide-- we don't
show world demand here.

00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:11.000
But world demand is
way above US demand.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:16.060
If you flip back to 19-3, the
reason that that P sub W line

00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:19.410
is below the P sub A
is that world supply--

00:13:19.410 --> 00:13:21.040
or 19-2 is easier--

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:25.340
world supply is above US supply.

00:13:25.340 --> 00:13:27.460
Since supply is higher,
the price falls.

00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:32.980
Now, in 19-4, world demand
is higher than US demand,

00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:34.720
so the price rises.

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:39.930
So we end up with a P sub
W at the higher level.

00:13:39.930 --> 00:13:41.740
What does this mean?

00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:47.320
With a higher P sub W, domestic
consumers want fewer computers.

00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:49.770
They used to be able to
buy computers at P sub A.

00:13:49.770 --> 00:13:51.970
Now they have to pay P
sub W, because they're

00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:54.830
competing with consumers
around the world.

00:13:54.830 --> 00:13:56.320
So they have to pay more.

00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:57.790
So they want fewer computers.

00:13:57.790 --> 00:14:01.600
Their demand for computers
falls from QA to CT.

00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:03.502
What about domestic producers?

00:14:03.502 --> 00:14:05.210
Well, now they're
getting a higher price,

00:14:05.210 --> 00:14:07.030
so they want to
make more computers.

00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:10.800
So their production
rises from QA to QT.

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:13.500
So you now have consumers
consuming much less

00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:15.400
than producers are making.

00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:18.645
So the producers send the rest
abroad, and that's exports.

00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:24.310
So we have the flip side.

00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:28.990
Before, we had-- in figure 19-2,
if you flip back and forth,

00:14:28.990 --> 00:14:33.700
in figure 19-2, we had consumers
wanting more than producers

00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:35.480
domestically willing to make.

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:36.920
So you had imports.

00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:39.280
Now we have domestic
consumers wanting

00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:41.830
less than domestic producers
are willing to make,

00:14:41.830 --> 00:14:43.800
so you have exports.

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:45.290
What are the welfare
implications?

00:14:45.290 --> 00:14:47.790
Go to 19-5.

00:14:47.790 --> 00:14:52.660
Now what you get is
consumers are worse off.

00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:56.260
They used to have a consumer
surplus of W plus X, where

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:58.790
X is the entire dotted area.

00:14:58.790 --> 00:15:01.460
Now, the consumer surplus has
fallen to just W. Remember,

00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:03.097
we're doing domestic
consumers only.

00:15:03.097 --> 00:15:05.180
There's some people in
Colombia who got computers.

00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:06.670
They're happy,
we're ignoring them.

00:15:06.670 --> 00:15:09.360
We're just doing US consumers.

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:11.810
They used to get W
plus X. Now they only

00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:15.280
get W. Below the demand
curve, above the new price.

00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:18.410
But producers,
who used to get Y,

00:15:18.410 --> 00:15:25.540
now get Y plus X plus Z.
So you've transferred X

00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:27.460
from domestic consumers,
domestic producers,

00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:30.970
but you've also given domestic
producers this extra bit Z.

00:15:30.970 --> 00:15:33.890
So once again,
surplus has gone up.

00:15:33.890 --> 00:15:36.260
So this is the crazy
thing about trade.

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:40.093
Imports raise welfare,
and exports raise welfare.

00:15:40.093 --> 00:15:41.885
Either way, whether
the goods are coming in

00:15:41.885 --> 00:15:43.850
or the goods are going
out, society as a whole

00:15:43.850 --> 00:15:46.110
is better off.

00:15:46.110 --> 00:15:46.730
Why?

00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:49.280
Because of
comparative advantage.

00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:51.260
Because we're better
off as a world

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:54.530
where we can share our goods
across nations, because we

00:15:54.530 --> 00:15:57.680
can then rely in the more
efficient producers lowering

00:15:57.680 --> 00:16:02.150
the prices for roses in places
like the US, and raise the--

00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:04.850
lowering the prices
for goods US consumes,

00:16:04.850 --> 00:16:07.340
and raising the price
for goods US produces.

00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:08.810
And same with every
other country.

00:16:08.810 --> 00:16:10.990
It's literally a win-win.

00:16:10.990 --> 00:16:13.690
Every country, by the
need to specialize,

00:16:13.690 --> 00:16:16.300
gets to see lower prices
in the goods they weren't

00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:19.740
good at making and higher
prices at the goods they

00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:22.670
are good at making.

00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:24.970
So this transfers across
producers and consumers,

00:16:24.970 --> 00:16:30.000
but overall, welfare goes up.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.060
So basically, this
is the bottom line.

00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:36.738
These two graphs are why
economists unambiguously--

00:16:36.738 --> 00:16:39.030
traditionally-- traditionally,
economists unambiguously

00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:40.068
like free trade.

00:16:40.068 --> 00:16:42.360
So you get into subtleties,
like caring about producers

00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:44.400
versus consumers separately.

00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:47.040
Basically, the
logic of last time,

00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:50.250
which is a comparative
advantage allows specialization,

00:16:50.250 --> 00:16:53.730
means that by trading, we can
allow countries to specialize,

00:16:53.730 --> 00:16:55.120
and thereby getting
higher prices

00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:57.780
for things they send abroad
and lower prices of the things

00:16:57.780 --> 00:17:00.572
they bring in from abroad.

00:17:00.572 --> 00:17:01.430
OK?

00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:04.680
Questions about that.

00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:06.873
And we can see from this
why the notion of a trade

00:17:06.873 --> 00:17:08.790
deficit as something
that we should care about

00:17:08.790 --> 00:17:10.780
is sort of ridiculous.

00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:13.710
Because it's all just
about your endowments.

00:17:13.710 --> 00:17:16.540
At the end of the day,
you want to sell stuff

00:17:16.540 --> 00:17:18.732
that you have a
comparative advantage in

00:17:18.732 --> 00:17:21.190
and import stuff you don't have
a comparative advantage in.

00:17:21.190 --> 00:17:22.960
If the rest of the world
has more compared advantage

00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:25.210
than you, then you want to
import more than you export.

00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:26.319
Doesn't mean you're
worse off, it just

00:17:26.319 --> 00:17:28.030
means your consumers
are benefiting

00:17:28.030 --> 00:17:29.488
from the fact the
rest of the world

00:17:29.488 --> 00:17:32.410
is good at making
stuff like sweaters.

00:17:32.410 --> 00:17:36.400
So that segues us naturally
to our important policy

00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:41.030
discussion, and one of the main
focuses of public policy today,

00:17:41.030 --> 00:17:43.660
which is trade policy.

00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:47.530
How do we take this
framework and apply it

00:17:47.530 --> 00:17:49.450
to thinking about
government policy

00:17:49.450 --> 00:17:50.590
over international trade?

00:17:50.590 --> 00:17:52.780
And that's what I'll spend the
rest of today talking about.

00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:53.345
So let me just
ask just before we

00:17:53.345 --> 00:17:55.137
go there, any questions
about the economics

00:17:55.137 --> 00:17:58.380
here, before we start
talking about policy?

00:17:58.380 --> 00:17:59.470
OK.

00:17:59.470 --> 00:18:04.550
Now, let's start once
again with trade policy

00:18:04.550 --> 00:18:07.640
with the standard
economics view.

00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:10.640
Which is that you'll
often hear people say,

00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:13.430
well, imports are a job killer.

00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:16.010
And in some sense,
they're right.

00:18:16.010 --> 00:18:19.370
That's what figure
19-3 is showing.

00:18:19.370 --> 00:18:22.720
Producers are the
ones with the jobs.

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:26.780
Producer surplus is
falling, so there's

00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:28.970
less profitability in
the corporate sector,

00:18:28.970 --> 00:18:30.680
so there may be less jobs there.

00:18:33.210 --> 00:18:36.960
Now, many people say we should
react to that by imposing

00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:40.290
restrictions on imports.

00:18:40.290 --> 00:18:42.600
They say, look,
exports are great,

00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:44.980
but what about imports
that are killing jobs?

00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:46.890
Why don't we restrict those?

00:18:46.890 --> 00:18:48.300
And there's two
fundamental forms

00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:49.920
of restrictions on imports.

00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:53.510
There's quotas,
which is literally

00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:56.720
a limit on how much of a
certain good you can import.

00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:59.310
Those aren't used
so much anymore.

00:18:59.310 --> 00:19:03.470
The more typical form of
import deterrents is tariffs.

00:19:06.470 --> 00:19:08.570
Is tariffs.

00:19:08.570 --> 00:19:09.740
OK?

00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:12.710
And basically, what
these are are taxes that

00:19:12.710 --> 00:19:14.270
are levied only on imports.

00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:16.820
A tariff is just
a name for a tax

00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:18.760
that only applies to imports.

00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:19.760
That's what a tariff is.

00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:23.060
It's a certain kind of tax
that only applies to imports.

00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:27.590
So we could, for
example, levy a tariff

00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:30.430
on roses coming
in from Colombia.

00:19:30.430 --> 00:19:34.270
If we levy that tariff,
making roses expensive enough,

00:19:34.270 --> 00:19:35.905
then folks might go
back to buying it

00:19:35.905 --> 00:19:37.280
from the US
producers, and we can

00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:40.320
reopen those greenhouses and
the jobs that come with them.

00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:41.790
That is true.

00:19:41.790 --> 00:19:44.220
What that misses the fact
that US consumers then

00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:47.550
suffer from paying
higher prices for roses.

00:19:47.550 --> 00:19:50.100
And on net, we're
worse off as a result.

00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:53.470
To see that, let's
go to figure 19-6.

00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:04.140
So basically, what
figure 19-6 does is

00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:07.290
we now start from
the position of being

00:20:07.290 --> 00:20:08.532
in international trading.

00:20:08.532 --> 00:20:10.740
So before, the other figures,
we started from autarky

00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:11.457
and added trade.

00:20:11.457 --> 00:20:13.290
Now I want to start
from position with trade

00:20:13.290 --> 00:20:14.310
and add a tariff.

00:20:14.310 --> 00:20:18.300
So initial equilibrium
is at P sub W,

00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:23.570
with consumers consuming
C1, producers producing Q1,

00:20:23.570 --> 00:20:25.770
and initial level
of imports denoted

00:20:25.770 --> 00:20:27.900
by imports before tariff.

00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:29.540
That's where we start.

00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:32.880
What the tariff does is
essentially raise the price

00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:34.700
back up.

00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:38.132
Now, I can't raise the price
above the domestic price,

00:20:38.132 --> 00:20:39.590
because if the
tariff's big enough,

00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:41.048
you just go back
to buying what you

00:20:41.048 --> 00:20:42.790
want for domestic producers.

00:20:42.790 --> 00:20:45.140
But it raises it back
towards the domestic price.

00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:48.730
So let's say, for example,
the tariff is high enough that

00:20:48.730 --> 00:20:50.480
the international--
that the world price--

00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:54.390
the price paid in the
US rises from PW to PT.

00:20:54.390 --> 00:20:57.120
The gap being the
amount of the tax.

00:20:57.120 --> 00:21:01.600
So with untaxed trade, the
US would pay PW for roses.

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:08.630
Now, when we tax trade, that
price goes up to P sub T. OK?

00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:11.900
So now, let's ask, what
does that do to the market?

00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:14.715
Well, it's pretty
straightforward.

00:21:14.715 --> 00:21:16.590
You just say, well, what
is demand and supply

00:21:16.590 --> 00:21:17.720
at that new price?

00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:19.610
Well, at that new price,
there's lower demand

00:21:19.610 --> 00:21:24.320
for roses, so rose demand
falls from C1 to C2.

00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:26.990
There's more domestic
production of roses,

00:21:26.990 --> 00:21:30.200
so domestic production
rises from Q1 to Q2.

00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:32.930
And the imports after the
tariff shrink massively.

00:21:32.930 --> 00:21:34.970
The tariff had its
desired effect.

00:21:34.970 --> 00:21:37.980
It shrunk imports.

00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:39.660
But what does this
do to welfare?

00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:40.720
Let's go to figure 19-7.

00:21:44.570 --> 00:21:47.810
Now, we can just compare
this area between the two

00:21:47.810 --> 00:21:48.650
horizontal lines.

00:21:48.650 --> 00:21:50.483
We used to be at the
bottom horizontal line.

00:21:50.483 --> 00:21:52.300
Now we're at the higher one.

00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:57.315
A, the area A is the
new producer surplus.

00:22:00.050 --> 00:22:03.140
Producers used to get the area--

00:22:03.140 --> 00:22:05.870
that low triangle
below area A. We

00:22:05.870 --> 00:22:11.000
used to call it Y. Now they've
added A. Producers have now

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:15.180
added a new producer surplus A.

00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:21.630
But consumers have lost A, B,
C, and D. That entire area is

00:22:21.630 --> 00:22:22.390
lost to consumers.

00:22:22.390 --> 00:22:22.890
Yeah.

00:22:22.890 --> 00:22:25.920
AUDIENCE: Is this [INAUDIBLE]
the comparison to when there

00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:26.860
was--

00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:28.610
JONATHAN GRUBER: Yeah,
that's what I said.

00:22:28.610 --> 00:22:31.780
Comparison-- when there
was free trade, no tariff.

00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:35.280
So it's a comparison
to the second situation

00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:40.650
in figure 19-3.

00:22:40.650 --> 00:22:43.575
So 19-3-- and this is
confusing, I'm sorry about that,

00:22:43.575 --> 00:22:45.450
but it's too hard to
put it all on one graph.

00:22:45.450 --> 00:22:49.230
19-3 is what happens when
we move from no trade

00:22:49.230 --> 00:22:50.900
to free trade.

00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:54.830
19-7, 6 and 7, I'm
going from free trade

00:22:54.830 --> 00:22:57.530
to free trade with a tariff.

00:22:57.530 --> 00:22:59.060
By the way, if the tariff was--

00:22:59.060 --> 00:23:00.830
brought us exactly back
to the no-trade situation,

00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:02.810
it'd just be the flip of
the previous diagrams.

00:23:02.810 --> 00:23:04.435
Just makes it a little
more interesting

00:23:04.435 --> 00:23:06.475
by making the tariff
somewhat lower than that.

00:23:06.475 --> 00:23:08.100
So what's happened
to consumer surplus?

00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:09.170
Well, look at this way.

00:23:09.170 --> 00:23:11.100
Remember consumer surplus.

00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:14.450
It's the area below the
demand curve, above the price.

00:23:14.450 --> 00:23:16.680
So it used to be
a huge triangle.

00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:21.440
Now what's happened is fallen
by the entire trapezoid, ABCD.

00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:22.700
Can folks see that?

00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:23.742
Look at the new consumer.

00:23:23.742 --> 00:23:25.700
Ignore the fact that it's
four different areas.

00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:27.180
Just think of it
as one trapezoid.

00:23:27.180 --> 00:23:29.000
The new consumer
surplus is the area

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.952
under the main curve above PT.

00:23:31.952 --> 00:23:34.160
The old consumer surplus is
the area under the demand

00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:35.720
curve above PW.

00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:39.620
That's followed by
the trapezoid ABCD.

00:23:39.620 --> 00:23:42.440
Now, why do we split
that into four pieces?

00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:45.263
Well, first of all, because
A is gained by producers,

00:23:45.263 --> 00:23:46.430
so we want to call that out.

00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:48.730
That's not a net
loss of welfare.

00:23:48.730 --> 00:23:54.160
There's also the area C, the
green area C. C is also a gain.

00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:55.090
What is C?

00:23:55.090 --> 00:23:58.812
That's the government
revenue from the tariffs.

00:23:58.812 --> 00:24:00.770
The government's gained
something from the-- we

00:24:00.770 --> 00:24:02.690
get tax revenue.

00:24:02.690 --> 00:24:04.770
We can give that back
to consumers if we want,

00:24:04.770 --> 00:24:06.990
so that's not lost surplus.

00:24:06.990 --> 00:24:08.660
The tax revenue's
exactly the amount

00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:12.450
of new imports times the tariff.

00:24:12.450 --> 00:24:13.630
So it's complicated.

00:24:13.630 --> 00:24:15.880
Now we have this third player
which is the government,

00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:17.640
It used to be just
either producer

00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:19.548
or consumer, or society.

00:24:19.548 --> 00:24:21.840
Now we have this third player,
which is the government.

00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:24.810
So the deadweight
loss from the tariff

00:24:24.810 --> 00:24:30.315
is B plus D. What we've
lost is B plus D. So

00:24:30.315 --> 00:24:31.690
let me go through
the math again.

00:24:31.690 --> 00:24:38.100
Consumers lost A plus B plus
C plus D. Producers gained A,

00:24:38.100 --> 00:24:43.110
and the government gained C.
So the net loss on the tariff

00:24:43.110 --> 00:24:48.540
is B plus D. That's sort of
hard, but do people see that?

00:24:48.540 --> 00:24:51.540
And that's why economists
don't like tariffs.

00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:55.110
Because the amount
producers gain,

00:24:55.110 --> 00:24:57.060
plus the amount the
government raises,

00:24:57.060 --> 00:24:59.280
is much less than
what consumers lose.

00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:02.100
Yeah, we've produced
some jobs growing roses.

00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:03.953
Yeah, we've gotten a
little tax revenue.

00:25:03.953 --> 00:25:05.370
But we've really
screwed producers

00:25:05.370 --> 00:25:07.770
who now have to pay much
higher prices for their roses.

00:25:07.770 --> 00:25:09.370
And if you add that
up, it's worse.

00:25:09.370 --> 00:25:10.290
Why is it worse?

00:25:10.290 --> 00:25:12.540
Because you're taking less
advantage of specialization

00:25:12.540 --> 00:25:15.240
in comparative advantage
by forcing us away

00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:16.490
from the most efficient point.

00:25:16.490 --> 00:25:18.115
The most efficient
point's where we can

00:25:18.115 --> 00:25:19.550
take-- everyone can specialize.

00:25:19.550 --> 00:25:20.633
You force that away.

00:25:20.633 --> 00:25:22.050
You've put the US,
which shouldn't

00:25:22.050 --> 00:25:25.200
be growing roses, back in
business of growing roses.

00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:27.210
And Colombia, which
should be growing roses,

00:25:27.210 --> 00:25:29.120
gets out of that business.

00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:30.146
Yeah.

00:25:30.146 --> 00:25:32.490
AUDIENCE: The tariffs--
where are tariffs applied?

00:25:32.490 --> 00:25:35.256
Are they on US--

00:25:35.256 --> 00:25:37.720
I guess importers
receive goods, or are

00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:41.303
they on [INAUDIBLE]
exporters [INAUDIBLE]..

00:25:41.303 --> 00:25:42.220
JONATHAN GRUBER: Yeah.

00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:43.410
So that's a great question.

00:25:43.410 --> 00:25:45.870
I am not expert on
the actual logistics,

00:25:45.870 --> 00:25:48.870
but roughly speaking,
when it comes into the US,

00:25:48.870 --> 00:25:49.915
into Customs--

00:25:49.915 --> 00:25:51.540
so any goods shipped
in the US for sale

00:25:51.540 --> 00:25:54.740
into Customs, at that point,
there is a tax levied on it.

00:25:54.740 --> 00:25:57.060
Now, I don't know logistically
who gets the bill.

00:25:57.060 --> 00:25:58.727
Does the exporting
company get the bill,

00:25:58.727 --> 00:26:00.750
or the importing
company get the bill?

00:26:00.750 --> 00:26:02.730
When we talk about
taxes, I'll show you

00:26:02.730 --> 00:26:04.320
it doesn't matter
who gets the bill.

00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:06.040
It's the same either way.

00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:07.110
So hold that thought.

00:26:07.110 --> 00:26:09.100
But that's basically
what happens.

00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:10.710
Good question.

00:26:10.710 --> 00:26:11.340
OK.

00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:16.170
So with that in mind, so that
is the fundamental reason,

00:26:16.170 --> 00:26:19.350
in graphical terms, why
economists don't like tariffs.

00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:21.120
But that's not the only reason.

00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:23.250
In fact, there's
two other reasons

00:26:23.250 --> 00:26:24.760
that aren't even
in this graph why

00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:26.820
tariffs and restrictions
on trade policy more

00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:28.960
generally are bad.

00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:32.560
The other reason is that
they cause trade wars.

00:26:38.690 --> 00:26:44.140
So let's say we impose this
tariffs for Colombian roses.

00:26:44.140 --> 00:26:46.730
Well, Colombia will
be like, screw you.

00:26:46.730 --> 00:26:48.260
If you're going
to tax our roses,

00:26:48.260 --> 00:26:50.630
we're taxing your computers.

00:26:50.630 --> 00:26:54.050
Well, what would happen if
there was a tariff that Colombia

00:26:54.050 --> 00:26:55.545
placed on our computers?

00:26:55.545 --> 00:26:57.170
Well, I don't have
that figure, but you

00:26:57.170 --> 00:27:01.040
should be able to show
yourself that that is exactly

00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:02.850
the opposite effect.

00:27:02.850 --> 00:27:06.290
It raises US consumer
surplus, because now computers

00:27:06.290 --> 00:27:09.680
are cheaper in the US because
we can't sell them in Colombia.

00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:11.743
But it lowers our
welfare, and now we

00:27:11.743 --> 00:27:13.160
don't get the
government revenues.

00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:14.840
Colombia does.

00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:19.360
So we lose almost all the
trapezoid in that case.

00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:21.030
If you flip this
around, we would

00:27:21.030 --> 00:27:22.690
get a small rise
in consumer surplus

00:27:22.690 --> 00:27:24.190
but a huge loss of
producer surplus,

00:27:24.190 --> 00:27:25.650
and we wouldn't even get the
government revenues to make it

00:27:25.650 --> 00:27:26.580
up.

00:27:26.580 --> 00:27:28.745
So that's really bad for us.

00:27:28.745 --> 00:27:30.370
And of course, it's
a natural response.

00:27:30.370 --> 00:27:33.350
Why wouldn't Columbia do it?

00:27:33.350 --> 00:27:37.460
So this first problem is,
this understates, yes, we

00:27:37.460 --> 00:27:39.410
might create some jobs
in roses, but we're

00:27:39.410 --> 00:27:42.243
going to destroy jobs in
computers, because we're not

00:27:42.243 --> 00:27:44.160
going to sell as many
computers as we used to.

00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:47.600
So it's not even job-creating.

00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:50.270
Once you take in the fact that
other countries retaliate,

00:27:50.270 --> 00:27:54.780
in fact, we make consumers worse
off and producers worse off.

00:27:54.780 --> 00:27:56.910
Because we make the price
for roses much higher,

00:27:56.910 --> 00:27:59.480
and we lose jobs in
the computer sector.

00:27:59.480 --> 00:27:59.980
Yeah.

00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:02.355
AUDIENCE: Is there a way to
diplomatically eliminate this

00:28:02.355 --> 00:28:04.106
if you're like a world monopoly?

00:28:04.106 --> 00:28:05.437
I feel like a world monopoly--

00:28:05.437 --> 00:28:07.020
JONATHAN GRUBER: So
basically, one way

00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:09.910
to do it is to come to trade
deals, where you essentially

00:28:09.910 --> 00:28:11.370
cartelize countries.

00:28:11.370 --> 00:28:12.870
So this is much--
if you could think

00:28:12.870 --> 00:28:15.930
of this in very parallel ways
to a non-cooperative oligopoly,

00:28:15.930 --> 00:28:17.760
if you can cooperate,
what do you do?

00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:19.277
You just get to free trade.

00:28:19.277 --> 00:28:21.360
And we'll talk about trade
deals in a few minutes.

00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:22.650
That's essentially
what those are doing.

00:28:22.650 --> 00:28:23.150
Yeah.

00:28:23.150 --> 00:28:25.074
AUDIENCE: Why are
current economic advisors

00:28:25.074 --> 00:28:28.415
in the government [INAUDIBLE]
tariffs [INAUDIBLE]??

00:28:28.415 --> 00:28:30.040
JONATHAN GRUBER: So
let me get to that.

00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:30.540
OK.

00:28:30.540 --> 00:28:33.640
So basically, what we've done--

00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:35.330
and let me answer
the first question.

00:28:35.330 --> 00:28:38.450
What we've done is, because
of the archetype made here,

00:28:38.450 --> 00:28:42.170
over time, we've created
essentially co-operative

00:28:42.170 --> 00:28:44.360
oligopolies around the world.

00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:46.470
The one you've
heard of a lot is--

00:28:46.470 --> 00:28:46.970
OK.

00:28:46.970 --> 00:28:48.380
So I'm sorry, trade
wars is the first thing.

00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:49.922
Let me [INAUDIBLE]
the second reason.

00:28:49.922 --> 00:28:52.297
The second reason
is that, actually,

00:28:52.297 --> 00:28:54.380
as decent human beings,
we might care about people

00:28:54.380 --> 00:28:56.960
in other countries too.

00:28:56.960 --> 00:28:59.975
And the fact is that there's--

00:28:59.975 --> 00:29:04.280
when you-- these both import
restrictions and trade wars

00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:06.625
hurt other countries
just like they hurt us.

00:29:06.625 --> 00:29:09.740
It's not only we worse off, but
other countries are worse off.

00:29:09.740 --> 00:29:12.530
Even without the trade war,
we've made ourselves worse off,

00:29:12.530 --> 00:29:14.072
and we've hurt
Colombia, because they

00:29:14.072 --> 00:29:16.146
can't sell the roses to the US.

00:29:16.146 --> 00:29:17.800
So the reason we don't like--

00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:20.080
so the other reason
besides this figure

00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:22.690
is that basically, if we
place any weight at all

00:29:22.690 --> 00:29:26.800
on the utility of people
outside the US, which we should,

00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:28.070
it's bad as well.

00:29:28.070 --> 00:29:31.000
Now, I'm not saying you have
to weigh the Colombians'

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:34.532
welfare the same as US welfare,
but as long as it's nonzero,

00:29:34.532 --> 00:29:36.240
then that's a second
reason to oppose it.

00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:38.760
And that's why there's been
a huge growth in agreements,

00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:40.920
the most famous of
which we've heard of

00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:44.160
is NAFTA, the North American
Free Trade Agreement,

00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:46.950
signed in the early 1990s
under President Clinton, which

00:29:46.950 --> 00:29:50.670
essentially set up a cooperative
oligopoly between the US,

00:29:50.670 --> 00:29:51.768
Mexico, and Canada.

00:29:51.768 --> 00:29:54.060
Essentially, let's just get
rid of these trade barriers

00:29:54.060 --> 00:29:56.820
so we can have freer
trade within our regimes.

00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:06.220
And basically-- but
this was actually

00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:08.860
you know quite popular at the
time, economists liked it.

00:30:08.860 --> 00:30:11.170
But it's become very
unpopular over time.

00:30:11.170 --> 00:30:13.063
Was opposed by President
Trump, and in fact,

00:30:13.063 --> 00:30:14.980
he recently ripped up
NAFTA, although replaced

00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:17.020
with something that's
pretty much the same, just

00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:20.170
renamed it as USMCA.

00:30:20.170 --> 00:30:24.460
So why are people so
opposed to free trade?

00:30:24.460 --> 00:30:25.810
It's a great question.

00:30:25.810 --> 00:30:28.480
Why are Trump's advisors--
why in fact are the majority--

00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:29.980
the majority of
Americans, depending

00:30:29.980 --> 00:30:32.330
on how you ask the question,
don't like free trade.

00:30:32.330 --> 00:30:33.830
It depends how you
ask the question.

00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:35.622
But it's certainly not
universally popular,

00:30:35.622 --> 00:30:36.760
like I said it should be.

00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:39.190
So what's going on?

00:30:39.190 --> 00:30:42.740
Well, there's really a
couple things going on.

00:30:42.740 --> 00:30:44.770
The first is that we can't--

00:30:44.770 --> 00:30:45.640
we don't.

00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:46.720
I wouldn't say "can't."

00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:48.295
We don't compensate the losers.

00:30:52.210 --> 00:30:53.620
This is the most important part.

00:30:56.340 --> 00:30:57.850
We don't compensate the losers.

00:30:57.850 --> 00:30:59.320
What do I mean by that?

00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:02.100
Let's go back to figure 19-3.

00:31:06.790 --> 00:31:09.920
What's happened when we've
put international trade?

00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:16.340
Producers have lost X.
Consumers have gained X and Z.

00:31:16.340 --> 00:31:18.740
So it's a simple
economic policy.

00:31:18.740 --> 00:31:21.050
If we did international
trade, and then just took

00:31:21.050 --> 00:31:25.210
X and gave it back to producers,
no one would be sadder.

00:31:25.210 --> 00:31:27.080
Even if we give a
little more than X.

00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:28.497
What if we did
international trade

00:31:28.497 --> 00:31:32.300
and gave producers
X plus 20% of Z?

00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:34.740
Then everybody wins.

00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:35.850
That's the [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:35.850 --> 00:31:38.460
The problem is we don't do that.

00:31:38.460 --> 00:31:42.170
All we do is let consumers have
these super cheap sweaters.

00:31:42.170 --> 00:31:45.230
So I get to go buy this
incredibly cheap sweater,

00:31:45.230 --> 00:31:49.230
and people in North Carolina's
livelihoods are destroyed.

00:31:49.230 --> 00:31:51.360
We don't compensate the losers.

00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:53.010
And the winners
don't notice they're

00:31:53.010 --> 00:31:55.350
paying $5 or $10
less for a sweater,

00:31:55.350 --> 00:31:59.270
but the losers notice
they don't have a job.

00:31:59.270 --> 00:32:01.750
So the problem is, yes,
there's more winning.

00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:03.970
But first of all, it's
winning among many more people

00:32:03.970 --> 00:32:06.220
by a small amount,
whereas losing

00:32:06.220 --> 00:32:08.410
is by fewer people
by a large amount,

00:32:08.410 --> 00:32:11.230
and that always gets
more political attention.

00:32:11.230 --> 00:32:14.250
And we don't have mechanisms
in place, or don't put in--

00:32:14.250 --> 00:32:16.000
I started "I can't,"
but it's not "can't."

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:17.356
We could.

00:32:17.356 --> 00:32:19.070
We could easily address this.

00:32:19.070 --> 00:32:20.780
There'd be a simple policy.

00:32:20.780 --> 00:32:28.010
What if we simply said, there'll
be a tax on all consumers

00:32:28.010 --> 00:32:31.113
of international-- not
just a tax on consumers,

00:32:31.113 --> 00:32:33.530
not of international goods--
that would be like a tariff--

00:32:33.530 --> 00:32:36.442
but just a general tax on
consumers of consumer goods

00:32:36.442 --> 00:32:38.150
that tend to come in
international trade.

00:32:38.150 --> 00:32:40.730
So it's a tax on clothes.

00:32:40.730 --> 00:32:43.070
And we'll take all
that money, and we'll

00:32:43.070 --> 00:32:45.590
redistribute it
to people who lost

00:32:45.590 --> 00:32:47.100
their jobs in the
textile sector,

00:32:47.100 --> 00:32:49.790
help retrain them for new
jobs, or help pay their bills

00:32:49.790 --> 00:32:51.530
while they find a new job.

00:32:51.530 --> 00:32:55.220
Then we could literally
deliver some of X

00:32:55.220 --> 00:32:57.200
and even maybe some
of Z to the producers.

00:32:57.200 --> 00:32:59.340
But we don't do that.

00:32:59.340 --> 00:33:01.790
And that's the main reason,
to answer your question, why

00:33:01.790 --> 00:33:03.300
does opposition to free trade?

00:33:03.300 --> 00:33:09.357
Is because people see the cost,
they don't see the benefits.

00:33:09.357 --> 00:33:11.940
And well-off people like me who
don't need-- who could happily

00:33:11.940 --> 00:33:14.580
afford to pay twice
as much for a sweater,

00:33:14.580 --> 00:33:17.280
we just get these benefits we
don't even pay attention to,

00:33:17.280 --> 00:33:20.550
whereas typically lower-income
workers, because they compete

00:33:20.550 --> 00:33:25.530
in lower-income countries, lose
their jobs and they notice it.

00:33:25.530 --> 00:33:27.360
So that's one big reason.

00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:29.970
The other big
reason is that there

00:33:29.970 --> 00:33:40.510
can be socially-damaging routes
to comparative advantage.

00:33:40.510 --> 00:33:42.037
There can be
socially-- that sounds

00:33:42.037 --> 00:33:43.870
like socially-damaging
routes to California.

00:33:43.870 --> 00:33:48.670
Socially-damaging routes
to comparative advantage.

00:33:48.670 --> 00:33:50.470
That is, there can be
ways that countries

00:33:50.470 --> 00:33:54.230
get to comparative advantage
that are not so happy.

00:33:54.230 --> 00:33:55.905
So why does China
have low labor costs?

00:33:55.905 --> 00:33:58.030
Partly because they got a
billion and a half people

00:33:58.030 --> 00:33:59.200
to work.

00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:02.440
But partly because workers
are massively exploited there.

00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:04.480
Work conditions are terrible.

00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:07.810
And it's a horrible life being
a worker in a Chinese factory.

00:34:07.810 --> 00:34:10.540
Moreover, there's terrible
environmental conditions

00:34:10.540 --> 00:34:12.889
imposed by Chinese production.

00:34:12.889 --> 00:34:16.127
In the US, we have restrictions
that try to minimize,

00:34:16.127 --> 00:34:18.710
in some ways, the environmental
damage done by our production.

00:34:18.710 --> 00:34:20.239
They don't have those in China.

00:34:20.239 --> 00:34:21.409
Or India.

00:34:21.409 --> 00:34:23.960
India is home to
three of the top five

00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:26.630
polluted cities in the world.

00:34:26.630 --> 00:34:27.570
They don't have those.

00:34:27.570 --> 00:34:31.120
So by creating their
comparative advantage,

00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:34.060
they may be doing damage
that we don't like.

00:34:34.060 --> 00:34:36.420
Just like we care about
the fact that consumers--

00:34:36.420 --> 00:34:38.929
that we care about other
countries' welfare,

00:34:38.929 --> 00:34:41.380
we might also care
about the fact

00:34:41.380 --> 00:34:45.540
that this free trade is hurting
other countries' welfare.

00:34:45.540 --> 00:34:46.498
So a great example--

00:34:46.498 --> 00:34:47.540
I've got a great example.

00:34:47.540 --> 00:34:49.610
A very relevant example
was a recent story

00:34:49.610 --> 00:34:52.280
about lead poisoning in China.

00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:54.199
There was this battery factory--

00:34:54.199 --> 00:34:56.179
batteries are big business now--

00:34:56.179 --> 00:35:00.470
that made lead acid batter for
motorcycles and electric bikes.

00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:03.410
And basically, they operated
in flagrant violation

00:35:03.410 --> 00:35:04.540
of environmental law.

00:35:04.540 --> 00:35:06.290
They would just dump
the mercury and stuff

00:35:06.290 --> 00:35:08.600
they were using in the
rivers and lakes all around.

00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:10.790
Flagrant, everybody knew it.

00:35:10.790 --> 00:35:14.180
And 233 adults and
99 children were

00:35:14.180 --> 00:35:16.550
found to have lead in their
blood up to seven times

00:35:16.550 --> 00:35:17.535
the safe amount.

00:35:17.535 --> 00:35:19.160
And they're basically
are going to be--

00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:21.980
lives will be destroyed by this.

00:35:21.980 --> 00:35:24.540
And this is a big issue in
the negotiation of NAFTA,

00:35:24.540 --> 00:35:26.450
and a big reason a lot
of people on the left

00:35:26.450 --> 00:35:29.030
don't like
international trade, is

00:35:29.030 --> 00:35:31.560
because they fear for
the welfare of people

00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:33.240
who are being affected.

00:35:33.240 --> 00:35:36.300
So when NAFTA was negotiated
in the early '90s,

00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:38.120
there were some
protections for workers.

00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:39.350
There were some protections.

00:35:39.350 --> 00:35:41.270
Basically, the idea was, Mexico,
if you want to sign this,

00:35:41.270 --> 00:35:42.830
you got to put in
some protections

00:35:42.830 --> 00:35:44.747
to raise the standard
of living of your worker

00:35:44.747 --> 00:35:46.270
and improve your environment.

00:35:46.270 --> 00:35:51.830
So once again, there are ways
to deal with this by saying,

00:35:51.830 --> 00:35:55.360
look, free trade, where you
impose some restrictions,

00:35:55.360 --> 00:35:57.370
is still better
than no free trade.

00:35:57.370 --> 00:35:59.500
So we might go in and say,
look, once again, it's

00:35:59.500 --> 00:36:03.530
all about how you spend Z. You
got a bunch of money to spend.

00:36:03.530 --> 00:36:04.780
How are you going to spend it?

00:36:04.780 --> 00:36:05.830
Some of the way
you can spend it is

00:36:05.830 --> 00:36:07.440
by compensating the producers.

00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:09.190
Another way you can
spend it is by saying,

00:36:09.190 --> 00:36:11.137
look, we'll be willing
to make it all smaller,

00:36:11.137 --> 00:36:13.720
have the world price be a little
bit higher, but make sure you

00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:15.520
have decent environmental
conditions and decent wages

00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:16.360
for your workers.

00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:18.610
As long as we don't impose
too high restrictions,

00:36:18.610 --> 00:36:20.455
we could still all gain.

00:36:20.455 --> 00:36:23.080
So that's another reason people
don't like international trade.

00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:26.220
On the other hand, we taught
the story of the child workers

00:36:26.220 --> 00:36:28.290
in Vietnam, and how
free trade in rice

00:36:28.290 --> 00:36:31.530
was better for them, because
the parents got richer and had

00:36:31.530 --> 00:36:33.150
them work less and
put them in school.

00:36:33.150 --> 00:36:34.900
So it's not clear
which way this goes,

00:36:34.900 --> 00:36:38.420
but that's certainly
another concern.

00:36:38.420 --> 00:36:40.610
And then finally,
there's the issue

00:36:40.610 --> 00:36:43.760
which is, I think, paramount
in this administration, which

00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:47.450
is trade policy--

00:36:47.450 --> 00:36:51.035
trade policy as a tool
of foreign policy.

00:36:58.040 --> 00:37:00.190
Trade policy as a tool
of foreign policy.

00:37:00.190 --> 00:37:04.378
Look, consider where we
are with China today.

00:37:04.378 --> 00:37:06.420
There's a host of reasons
to be angry with China.

00:37:06.420 --> 00:37:07.930
Now, some are irrational.

00:37:07.930 --> 00:37:10.340
The Trump's administration
obsession with trade deficits,

00:37:10.340 --> 00:37:12.530
as I've explained
repeatedly, is irrational.

00:37:12.530 --> 00:37:15.130
It's the Pikachu fallacy.

00:37:15.130 --> 00:37:18.160
But some of it's rational.

00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:20.230
China-- we operate
under something

00:37:20.230 --> 00:37:21.910
called the World
Trade Organization.

00:37:21.910 --> 00:37:23.050
Once again, coming to
the other question,

00:37:23.050 --> 00:37:25.250
it's another chance to try
to cartelize the country

00:37:25.250 --> 00:37:29.800
and set a-- cartelize the world
and set a set of fair trading

00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:30.700
rules.

00:37:30.700 --> 00:37:32.050
The World Trade Organization.

00:37:32.050 --> 00:37:35.080
China repeatedly violates the
rules set up by the World Trade

00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:36.950
Organization.

00:37:36.950 --> 00:37:38.930
For example, under
those rules, China

00:37:38.930 --> 00:37:44.120
should allow much freer
sales of US goods in China,

00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:46.010
but they implicitly
restrict them.

00:37:46.010 --> 00:37:47.600
Not on paper, but in practice.

00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:49.760
They set up lots of
practices which makes

00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:52.650
it harder to sell US goods.

00:37:52.650 --> 00:37:56.790
They also do a lot of
significant industrial

00:37:56.790 --> 00:37:59.122
espionage and stealing
our industrial secrets.

00:37:59.122 --> 00:38:00.580
So one way to do
that, for example,

00:38:00.580 --> 00:38:04.050
is China has a rule that you
cannot have a solely-owned

00:38:04.050 --> 00:38:05.783
subsidiary in China.

00:38:05.783 --> 00:38:07.200
If you want a
subsidiary in China,

00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:09.930
it has to be jointly owned
with a Chinese company.

00:38:09.930 --> 00:38:12.890
Which then will
promptly take the ideas,

00:38:12.890 --> 00:38:16.290
and pass them on, and kick
you out of the country.

00:38:16.290 --> 00:38:19.460
So China's engaged in
some nasty practices

00:38:19.460 --> 00:38:21.940
which are bad for the US--

00:38:21.940 --> 00:38:22.940
which are certainly bad.

00:38:22.940 --> 00:38:24.065
They may be good for China.

00:38:24.065 --> 00:38:26.700
They're certainly bad
for US self-interests.

00:38:26.700 --> 00:38:27.840
And that's true.

00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:29.610
That is unambiguously true.

00:38:29.610 --> 00:38:33.402
The question is, what's
the right response?

00:38:33.402 --> 00:38:34.860
And the Trump
administration argues

00:38:34.860 --> 00:38:36.550
the right response is tariffs.

00:38:36.550 --> 00:38:40.110
The right response is to
punish China through tariffs

00:38:40.110 --> 00:38:42.640
for their bad behavior.

00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:45.860
And economists--
virtually all economists--

00:38:45.860 --> 00:38:47.390
say that's the wrong response.

00:38:47.390 --> 00:38:51.700
There is literally less
than 1% of economists

00:38:51.700 --> 00:38:52.825
who agree with this policy.

00:38:52.825 --> 00:38:54.201
Just a few of them
happen to work

00:38:54.201 --> 00:38:55.580
with the Trump administration.

00:38:55.580 --> 00:38:56.690
But basically, at
the end of the day,

00:38:56.690 --> 00:38:58.160
basically virtually
all economists

00:38:58.160 --> 00:38:59.450
agree that it's a bad idea.

00:38:59.450 --> 00:39:01.850
And that's for three reasons.

00:39:01.850 --> 00:39:03.910
The first reason is
our standard reason

00:39:03.910 --> 00:39:05.410
that we think trade is good.

00:39:05.410 --> 00:39:08.560
We think we're hurting
ourselves by imposing tariffs

00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:09.280
on Chinese goods.

00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:10.290
All we're doing is
hurting ourselves.

00:39:10.290 --> 00:39:11.915
We're making people
pay more for stuff.

00:39:11.915 --> 00:39:14.630
Why would we want to do that?

00:39:14.630 --> 00:39:17.390
Moreover, we're
causing a trade war.

00:39:17.390 --> 00:39:19.250
China's now imposing
tariffs on our goods,

00:39:19.250 --> 00:39:20.750
which hurts our producers.

00:39:20.750 --> 00:39:23.735
So our farmers, for
example, are going

00:39:23.735 --> 00:39:25.110
to suffer because
it'll be harder

00:39:25.110 --> 00:39:27.120
to sell our farm goods in China
because of the new tariffs

00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:28.100
they've imposed.

00:39:28.100 --> 00:39:31.110
So the standard arguments
we have here still hold.

00:39:31.110 --> 00:39:33.610
We like free trade because
it expands opportunities,

00:39:33.610 --> 00:39:34.715
and if we try to limit
it, other countries

00:39:34.715 --> 00:39:37.420
will respond in a way which
further restrict opportunities.

00:39:37.420 --> 00:39:41.480
So that's the standard reason
economists are mad about this.

00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:44.333
The second reason is it's
sort of hard to do this.

00:39:44.333 --> 00:39:46.250
It's hard to use trade
police [INAUDIBLE] tool

00:39:46.250 --> 00:39:47.840
of foreign policy
because it's not

00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:49.970
even clear what's made
in China and what's

00:39:49.970 --> 00:39:52.560
made in America anymore.

00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:54.770
So if we build the
car in America,

00:39:54.770 --> 00:39:57.580
but the parts are made in
China, is it an American car

00:39:57.580 --> 00:39:58.982
or a Chinese car?

00:39:58.982 --> 00:40:00.440
Oftentimes, we'll
have things which

00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:02.857
are shipped to China, back to
America, then back to China,

00:40:02.857 --> 00:40:04.132
or vice versa.

00:40:04.132 --> 00:40:07.448
So it's not even clear what's
a Chinese import or export

00:40:07.448 --> 00:40:08.740
and what's US import or export.

00:40:08.740 --> 00:40:10.540
These are blurry lines now.

00:40:10.540 --> 00:40:13.220
Now, once again, that's all
because of the efficiency

00:40:13.220 --> 00:40:13.970
of production.

00:40:13.970 --> 00:40:16.160
Basically, what
we've done over time

00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:20.450
is we've sort of
disaggregated production

00:40:20.450 --> 00:40:22.070
to more and more
efficient components.

00:40:22.070 --> 00:40:24.095
It used to be one guy
made the whole car.

00:40:24.095 --> 00:40:25.970
Now we recognize there
are certain parts that

00:40:25.970 --> 00:40:27.428
are made more
efficiently in China,

00:40:27.428 --> 00:40:29.660
certain parts made more
efficiently in Cambodia,

00:40:29.660 --> 00:40:32.130
more efficiently in the US,
more efficiently in Germany,

00:40:32.130 --> 00:40:33.543
and we put them together.

00:40:33.543 --> 00:40:35.960
What that does is it makes
international trade super messy

00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:36.980
to understand.

00:40:36.980 --> 00:40:38.662
But it makes the
world better off.

00:40:38.662 --> 00:40:40.745
It's just further increasing
comparative advantage

00:40:40.745 --> 00:40:41.980
and specialization.

00:40:41.980 --> 00:40:44.147
But it makes it hard to
decide what's a Chinese good

00:40:44.147 --> 00:40:45.140
and what's a US good.

00:40:45.140 --> 00:40:47.070
So that's the second problem.

00:40:47.070 --> 00:40:49.910
And the third and probably the
single most important criticism

00:40:49.910 --> 00:40:53.900
economists make is, this
is a really silly thing

00:40:53.900 --> 00:40:55.880
to do by yourself.

00:40:55.880 --> 00:40:58.760
The US is big, but
we still represent

00:40:58.760 --> 00:41:02.298
a minority of Chinese exports.

00:41:02.298 --> 00:41:04.840
We obviously [INAUDIBLE] a large
share, but still a minority.

00:41:04.840 --> 00:41:09.003
As long as China can still
sell to other people,

00:41:09.003 --> 00:41:10.420
and they're making
plenty of money

00:41:10.420 --> 00:41:13.580
off their practices against
us, they might not stop.

00:41:13.580 --> 00:41:16.195
Now, they prefer to sell to us.

00:41:16.195 --> 00:41:17.570
But if you think
on the one hand,

00:41:17.570 --> 00:41:19.600
they're making a ton of
money ripping us off.

00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:22.780
On the other hand, they'll
still get to sell 70%, 80%

00:41:22.780 --> 00:41:25.665
as much to the rest of the
world once they adjust things.

00:41:25.665 --> 00:41:27.040
Then maybe they'll
be like, fine.

00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:28.332
We're happy to let you do that.

00:41:28.332 --> 00:41:30.740
You're just cutting off your
nose to spite your face.

00:41:30.740 --> 00:41:34.060
But if we get the whole
world to coordinate and say,

00:41:34.060 --> 00:41:36.850
you violated the norms of
the World Trade Organization,

00:41:36.850 --> 00:41:39.700
we're now all going to set up
trade restrictions on China,

00:41:39.700 --> 00:41:42.048
then they feel the pain.

00:41:42.048 --> 00:41:43.590
So the other reason
economists oppose

00:41:43.590 --> 00:41:48.680
this is moving unilaterally on
trade just doesn't make sense.

00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:52.200
If you want to try to
deal with these problems,

00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:55.320
you need to through
coordinated response.

00:41:55.320 --> 00:41:57.660
Now, let me be very clear.

00:41:57.660 --> 00:42:01.680
This is a very, very hard issue.

00:42:01.680 --> 00:42:03.810
Economists try to
make it very simple

00:42:03.810 --> 00:42:06.530
with our surplus diagrams
and stuff like that,

00:42:06.530 --> 00:42:09.360
but it's a super hard issue.

00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:14.790
Nonetheless, it's an issue where
your bias in thinking about it

00:42:14.790 --> 00:42:17.355
should be towards the
basic bias of economics,

00:42:17.355 --> 00:42:19.230
which is that if we can
expand opportunities,

00:42:19.230 --> 00:42:21.610
that's a good thing.

00:42:21.610 --> 00:42:24.190
And the real
challenge is twofold.

00:42:24.190 --> 00:42:27.930
How do we expand opportunity
sets in a fair way?

00:42:27.930 --> 00:42:30.570
And two, how do we deal
with compensating the losers

00:42:30.570 --> 00:42:32.182
as opportunity sets advance?

00:42:32.182 --> 00:42:34.140
And this is something
we'll spend a lot of time

00:42:34.140 --> 00:42:37.680
on after Thanksgiving, is
how we redistribute society

00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:39.610
from one group to another.

00:42:39.610 --> 00:42:40.110
OK.

00:42:40.110 --> 00:42:40.960
Now let me get some questions.

00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:43.120
I know, this is sort of
a top [INAUDIBLE]---- yeah.

00:42:43.120 --> 00:42:50.420
AUDIENCE: So on an
international level,

00:42:50.420 --> 00:42:52.510
when a country behaves
badly, sometimes

00:42:52.510 --> 00:42:54.790
the UN will suggest
that sanctions are

00:42:54.790 --> 00:42:56.938
imposed against the country.

00:42:56.938 --> 00:42:59.480
And I was wondering if you know
anything about how that tends

00:42:59.480 --> 00:43:01.320
to work in terms of welfare?

00:43:01.320 --> 00:43:05.360
Like, do the sanctions tend to
make a country behave better,

00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:08.500
and then ultimately the
world is better off,

00:43:08.500 --> 00:43:09.935
or are those also a bad idea?

00:43:09.935 --> 00:43:12.320
JONATHAN GRUBER: That's a
really interesting question.

00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:14.770
So let's think about
sanctions in this framework.

00:43:14.770 --> 00:43:18.623
So sanctions-- let's say
one sanction would be--

00:43:18.623 --> 00:43:20.290
it depends on the
form of the sanctions.

00:43:20.290 --> 00:43:21.160
It depends-- et cetera.

00:43:21.160 --> 00:43:22.827
So one sanction would
be, literally, you

00:43:22.827 --> 00:43:24.310
have to pay a bunch of money.

00:43:24.310 --> 00:43:26.560
Well, then, that's just
like a tax on the country.

00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:28.810
We just think about that, think
of the country individual.

00:43:28.810 --> 00:43:29.590
They're worse off.

00:43:29.590 --> 00:43:30.310
The UN gets some money.

00:43:30.310 --> 00:43:32.602
In some sense, it depends on
whether the sanction works

00:43:32.602 --> 00:43:33.140
or not.

00:43:33.140 --> 00:43:36.070
So the easy case is just
simply the trade-off of, do

00:43:36.070 --> 00:43:38.080
you encourage a behavior
you want to encourage,

00:43:38.080 --> 00:43:40.000
versus what pain do you
impose on the country,

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:41.560
and how do you trade
those two things off?

00:43:41.560 --> 00:43:42.610
If they're a really
bad-acting country,

00:43:42.610 --> 00:43:44.230
you might not carry
imposing pain on them.

00:43:44.230 --> 00:43:46.772
As long as there's some chance
you get the change in behavior

00:43:46.772 --> 00:43:48.040
you want, you're happy.

00:43:48.040 --> 00:43:50.260
But what if the
sanction's limiting trade?

00:43:50.260 --> 00:43:52.660
Well, then you're hurting
other countries too.

00:43:52.660 --> 00:43:54.190
Then it becomes a bit trickier.

00:43:54.190 --> 00:43:56.590
So then once again, the
trade-off is three-piece.

00:43:56.590 --> 00:43:59.360
I hurt the country
I want to hurt.

00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:01.520
But I hurt countries
I don't want to hurt.

00:44:01.520 --> 00:44:03.950
But I also may get a
change in behavior I want.

00:44:03.950 --> 00:44:05.630
So you have to weigh-- you
have to add those three pieces

00:44:05.630 --> 00:44:06.620
and put them together.

00:44:06.620 --> 00:44:07.530
How do you put them together?

00:44:07.530 --> 00:44:09.380
That's exactly what we'll
talk about after Thanksgiving.

00:44:09.380 --> 00:44:11.505
You put them together by
thinking about a weighting

00:44:11.505 --> 00:44:14.540
function, which we call social
welfare function, which weights

00:44:14.540 --> 00:44:16.415
the well-being of all
these different parties

00:44:16.415 --> 00:44:17.565
and puts them together.

00:44:17.565 --> 00:44:19.940
A very related issue we haven't
talked-- yeah, I'm sorry,

00:44:19.940 --> 00:44:20.700
go ahead.

00:44:20.700 --> 00:44:23.200
AUDIENCE: So do you think that
the current administration is

00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:27.176
putting in these policies to try
and gain popularity because so

00:44:27.176 --> 00:44:29.422
many people understand trade?

00:44:29.422 --> 00:44:32.210
JONATHAN GRUBER:
You know, I think

00:44:32.210 --> 00:44:36.275
there's almost no one who
makes any money by trying

00:44:36.275 --> 00:44:38.900
to understand what's in the mind
of the current administration.

00:44:38.900 --> 00:44:41.750
So I have no idea.

00:44:41.750 --> 00:44:44.120
I think China is engaging
in bad practices,

00:44:44.120 --> 00:44:45.710
but I also think
it's good politics,

00:44:45.710 --> 00:44:48.795
and it's hard to
know what's the mix.

00:44:48.795 --> 00:44:49.920
But let's actually relate--

00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:50.765
[INAUDIBLE] take the
current administration,

00:44:50.765 --> 00:44:52.530
this raises another issue
that's related to all this

00:44:52.530 --> 00:44:54.030
which we haven't
talked about, which

00:44:54.030 --> 00:44:56.550
is what about immigration?

00:44:56.550 --> 00:44:59.210
Another-- I'm going to stop
before I get to abortion.

00:45:02.810 --> 00:45:04.720
What about immigration?

00:45:04.720 --> 00:45:07.370
Well, immigration,
actually, the framework

00:45:07.370 --> 00:45:10.940
is very much the same.

00:45:10.940 --> 00:45:15.650
If there are people who can
contribute to our society

00:45:15.650 --> 00:45:19.410
by coming here, then
we are better off

00:45:19.410 --> 00:45:24.035
by letting them in by the
same logic of specialization

00:45:24.035 --> 00:45:26.210
and comparative advantage.

00:45:26.210 --> 00:45:27.300
If there are people--

00:45:27.300 --> 00:45:31.070
for example, let's say US folks
don't want to pick our crops,

00:45:31.070 --> 00:45:33.223
and we don't want
to clean toilets.

00:45:33.223 --> 00:45:35.390
But picking crops and
cleaning toilets at a low wage

00:45:35.390 --> 00:45:38.300
is a terrific opportunity for
someone from another country.

00:45:38.300 --> 00:45:41.860
Then we could be better
off by letting them in.

00:45:41.860 --> 00:45:43.390
Or let's say-- as
it's turned out

00:45:43.390 --> 00:45:46.210
to be true historically-- the
kind of person who wants take

00:45:46.210 --> 00:45:49.330
the risk to immigrate to America
is the kind of person who

00:45:49.330 --> 00:45:51.667
often becomes an entrepreneur
and thinks up new ideas.

00:45:51.667 --> 00:45:53.500
Much of the entrepreneurial
ideas in America

00:45:53.500 --> 00:45:55.660
have come from our nation's
history of immigrants.

00:45:55.660 --> 00:45:57.100
Because who picks up and leaves?

00:45:57.100 --> 00:45:58.850
It's kind of a
risky thing to do.

00:45:58.850 --> 00:46:00.475
To pick up, leave
your home, and leave,

00:46:00.475 --> 00:46:01.840
and come to this unknown place.

00:46:01.840 --> 00:46:03.550
And those risk-loving
people are often

00:46:03.550 --> 00:46:06.110
the kind of people
who think up new ideas

00:46:06.110 --> 00:46:08.160
and want to start
new businesses.

00:46:08.160 --> 00:46:10.550
So for that reason,
immigration has traditionally

00:46:10.550 --> 00:46:13.530
been an enormous benefit
to the US economy.

00:46:13.530 --> 00:46:15.890
And I think today, the general
consensus-- this is more

00:46:15.890 --> 00:46:17.630
controversial than free trade.

00:46:17.630 --> 00:46:20.390
But I think the general
consensus among economists

00:46:20.390 --> 00:46:23.510
is that immigration on net
is good for the country,

00:46:23.510 --> 00:46:26.860
but there's redistributional
consequences.

00:46:26.860 --> 00:46:29.890
It's good for rich
people because they

00:46:29.890 --> 00:46:33.375
get low-pay people to pick their
fruits and do their lawn work.

00:46:33.375 --> 00:46:35.500
But it's bad for people
who used to pick the fruits

00:46:35.500 --> 00:46:37.350
and do the lawn work.

00:46:37.350 --> 00:46:39.480
So once again, if
we can figure out

00:46:39.480 --> 00:46:42.030
a way to compensate
the losers, immigration

00:46:42.030 --> 00:46:43.860
is probably [INAUDIBLE] good.

00:46:43.860 --> 00:46:45.210
Now, it's more complicated.

00:46:45.210 --> 00:46:48.848
When we import a car, it doesn't
get welfare or commit crimes.

00:46:48.848 --> 00:46:50.890
Immigrants might get on
welfare or commit crimes,

00:46:50.890 --> 00:46:53.430
so it's more complicated
than just free trade.

00:46:53.430 --> 00:46:55.560
So what you have to
do in that case is you

00:46:55.560 --> 00:46:58.140
have to look at the evidence.

00:46:58.140 --> 00:47:01.110
And the evidence is that
immigrants commit crime

00:47:01.110 --> 00:47:04.710
at a much lower rate than
comparable US citizens

00:47:04.710 --> 00:47:08.070
and collect welfare at a much
lower rate than comparable US

00:47:08.070 --> 00:47:09.000
citizens.

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:10.667
So you can't compare
an immigrant to me.

00:47:10.667 --> 00:47:13.250
An immigrant is more likely to
commit crime or collect welfare

00:47:13.250 --> 00:47:15.920
than I am, but immigrant's
also less educated than I am.

00:47:15.920 --> 00:47:17.170
I'm not the comparable person.

00:47:17.170 --> 00:47:18.780
Compare an immigrant
to the person

00:47:18.780 --> 00:47:20.920
they're replacing
in the labor market.

00:47:20.920 --> 00:47:23.025
A low-skilled US citizen.

00:47:23.025 --> 00:47:24.900
Immigrants are less
likely to collect welfare

00:47:24.900 --> 00:47:28.030
and less likely to commit
crimes than are those people.

00:47:28.030 --> 00:47:31.080
So as a result, those arguments
don't really bode well

00:47:31.080 --> 00:47:32.670
for restricting immigration.

00:47:32.670 --> 00:47:34.300
On the other hand,
I think there's

00:47:34.300 --> 00:47:36.300
very few people who say
we should have a totally

00:47:36.300 --> 00:47:39.330
porous and open border.

00:47:39.330 --> 00:47:41.040
Because of illegal
movement of goods,

00:47:41.040 --> 00:47:44.615
and because we don't want
people objectively criminal

00:47:44.615 --> 00:47:46.490
in other countries that
are also risk-loving,

00:47:46.490 --> 00:47:48.670
we don't necessarily
want them here.

00:47:48.670 --> 00:47:50.218
So I think this is a hard issue.

00:47:50.218 --> 00:47:51.593
Unlike international
trade, where

00:47:51.593 --> 00:47:54.410
I think economists would
say just more is good,

00:47:54.410 --> 00:47:57.410
I think that immigration, there
are some difficult trade-offs,

00:47:57.410 --> 00:47:59.630
because people come
with a set of baggage

00:47:59.630 --> 00:48:02.450
that goods don't come with.

00:48:02.450 --> 00:48:04.060
But I think economists
would generally

00:48:04.060 --> 00:48:06.310
say a lot of the
same arguments apply.

00:48:06.310 --> 00:48:09.100
We might need a more
comprehensive policy

00:48:09.100 --> 00:48:11.700
than we have when it
comes to trading goods.

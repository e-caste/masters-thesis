00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.740
PROFESSOR: If you're
a teacher and you're

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:12.880
inventing a course for the first
time, or revising it a lot,

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.010
you sit down with
your teaching partners

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:19.320
and you put on the
table all the ideas.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.370
Teaching, you've got an
ever-expanding universe

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:25.960
of knowledge out
there, and you have

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.450
to cherry-pick the things that
are going to be important.

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:31.910
It has to hang together.

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.500
One of the strategies
JoAnne and I thought,

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.860
when we went into the current
iteration of teaching 5.07

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:44.650
biological chemistry, was
to abandon completely,

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:50.680
higher eukaryotes, namely
us, because genome sequencing

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:58.390
projects had sequenced so many
bacteria that one could create

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.960
an entire course in biochemistry
that would be very meaningful,

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.390
just focusing on microorganisms.

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.650
We spent a couple of days
reading and thinking about it.

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.800
That would be the course
JoAnne and I would teach,

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.040
if it weren't for the
fact that we actually

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.880
have-- feel as though we have
a commitment to students that

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.220
are going to go on
to medical school

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:27.380
and therefore, if we avoided
mammalian biochemistry,

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.130
students wouldn't know
anything about the mitochondria

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.620
and organelles, and
things like that that

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.380
are associated with eukaryotes.

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:41.270
We wouldn't be able to make
these connections to disease,

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.670
the physiological scenarios.

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.430
Nevertheless, why were we
so interested in bacteria?

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.200
What would be an
interesting story,

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:53.130
that I might be able to tell
you, if we had taken that path.

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.520
So we have a fellow in
biological engineering,

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.680
named Eric Alm.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:03.460
And he is an informaticist
and an engineer,

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.770
and an extremely good chemist.

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.669
He really knows his pathways.

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:13.340
When he looks at
a cell, he thinks

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.610
about what it is, but
also where it came from,

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.990
in terms of how it evolved from
precursors, its family tree,

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.030
so to speak.

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.570
One of the most
interesting organisms

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:28.940
that he's published
on, not too long ago,

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.820
is an organism
called, Desulforudis.

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:38.980
And this would be a wonderful
biochemistry course in itself.

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:45.200
He wondered, if he went out and
dug up a cubic meter of dirt--

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.890
and outside MIT-- and if
he did 16S RNA sequencing,

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.430
how many living things would
be there, many thousands, maybe

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.270
10,000.

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:59.680
Then he asked the question, what
if you went down 100 meters,

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.050
you know, maybe you see 1,000.

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:04.240
But what if you go down
until there's really

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.160
only one thing there.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.810
And that's what he did, going
down two miles into the ground.

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:16.240
And there was a single, species
ecosystem called, Desulforudis.

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:17.650
And I remember
seeing this paper,

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.190
and I brought it over to JoAnne.

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.880
I was so excited
because the last picture

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.650
showed its metabolic network,
its metabolic pathways.

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.450
It had everything.

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:29.710
And it makes sense.

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:32.840
It can't rely on other things.

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.770
For example, we can't make
all of our amino acids.

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:38.110
We got to get them
from food that we eat,

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:40.960
or in our co-factors,
some of our vitamins

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:44.410
are made by the
bacteria in our gut.

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:50.410
So, if all the bacteria
disappear, we would too.

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:52.720
So we rely on other
things, but Desulforudis

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.680
doesn't rely on anything.

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:59.500
So when you look at it's
biochemical networks,

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.990
what you see is that
it can fix nitrogen. It

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:05.320
can take N2 and convert
it NH3, and then

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.180
put that into amino
acids, and it can

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.160
make all of its amino acids.

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.670
It has a really good
pentose phosphate pathway.

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:15.640
It actually uses
radiation in a strange way

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.240
to generate some of the
energy that it needs.

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:21.760
It uses it to generate
carbon monoxide.

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.930
Ultimately, that CO is going
to form an acetyl group that

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:29.200
will be able to generate
all of the organic material

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:32.230
inside the Desulforudis.

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:36.730
It's got all kinds of
electron transport pathways.

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:40.510
So it's developed
enormous versatility

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:43.420
by being a
single-species ecosystem.

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:46.510
So, again, this
was a course where

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:50.890
we had to make a compromise
because of our clientele.

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:52.660
Teachers have to
think about that.

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:56.650
We have to teach to what
the people need in order

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:58.850
to go on to the next step.

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:00.580
But as sort of a
closing thought,

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:02.140
I think that it
would be wonderful

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:06.370
for next-generation biochemists
to really turn their attention

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:11.740
to the microbial world, to
teach this vast biochemistry

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:17.630
and understand how
bacteria effortlessly,

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:22.430
swap biochemical pathways,
pick-up entire biochemical

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:24.860
pathways without even
breaking a sweat.

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:27.860
Whenever they find
themselves stressed,

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:31.570
they just pick up a new
pathway and they survive.

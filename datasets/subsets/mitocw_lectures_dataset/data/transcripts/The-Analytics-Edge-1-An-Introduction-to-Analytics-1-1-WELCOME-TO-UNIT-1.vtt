00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.580
Welcome to 15.071x,
the Analytics Edge.

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.430
I'm Allison O'Hair, and together
with Dimitris Bertsimas,

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:15.260
we'll be the instructors
for this course.

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.720
During this week, we'll
start with an introduction

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.070
to analytics and
to the topics we'll

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.110
cover throughout the course.

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:23.820
Then in the second
lecture, we'll

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.060
introduce R, a statistical
modeling language that we'll

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.320
use throughout
most of the course.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.100
The recitation and homework
assignment this week

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.410
were designed to give you
more practice working in R.

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.470
And by the end of the week,
we hope that you'll already

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:41.190
be convinced about
the power of data.

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.150
Let's get started.

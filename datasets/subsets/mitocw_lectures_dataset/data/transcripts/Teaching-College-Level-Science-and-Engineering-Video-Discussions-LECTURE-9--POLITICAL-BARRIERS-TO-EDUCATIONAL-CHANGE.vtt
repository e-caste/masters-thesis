00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.370
Audio quality for this video
is poor due to technical

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:26.728
difficulties.

00:00:26.728 --> 00:00:30.130
PROFESSOR: OK, today, political
barriers to

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.532
educational change.

00:00:33.532 --> 00:00:37.070
"One had to cram all this stuff
into one's mind, whether

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:38.110
one liked it or not.

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:41.613
This coercion had such a
determined effect that after I

00:00:41.613 --> 00:00:43.680
had passed the final examination
I found the

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.950
consideration of any
scientific problems

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:50.116
distasteful to me for an entire
year." Who said that?

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.740
Einstein, so one of the greatest
scientists in the

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:59.940
last 300 or 400 years.

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.002
So that was the effect of
regular school and education

00:01:04.002 --> 00:01:06.226
on Einstein.

00:01:06.226 --> 00:01:09.467
And it's not just Einstein.

00:01:09.467 --> 00:01:11.330
It's a general pattern.

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:17.894
So here, from Manchester, New
Hampshire, in the 1930's is

00:01:17.894 --> 00:01:22.760
how Bruce [? Betiset ?]
superintendent describes the

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.150
children's approach to learning
and to reading and

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.102
interest in knowledge.

00:01:28.102 --> 00:01:30.430
"In the traditional fourth
grades, when I asked children

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.056
to tell me what they'd been
reading, they were hesitant,

00:01:33.056 --> 00:01:34.475
embarrassed, and diffident.

00:01:34.475 --> 00:01:37.405
In one fourth grade I cannot
find a single child who would

00:01:37.405 --> 00:01:40.540
admit that he had committed
the sin of reading.

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:42.480
I did not have single volunteer
and when I tried to

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.610
draft them, the children
stood up, shook

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.858
their heads, sat down.

00:01:46.858 --> 00:01:50.070
In the four experimental fourth
grades the children

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.910
fairly fought to tell me what
they had been reading.

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:56.619
The hour closed-- in each case--
with a dozen hands

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:59.614
waved in the and little faces
crestfallen because we had not

00:01:59.614 --> 00:02:02.780
got around to hear what
they had to tell."

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.110
So the contrast is
pretty strong.

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.280
And the question is why do
experiments like what

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.000
[? Betiset ?] did not survive?

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.142
Whereas why does the education
system tend to have an effect

00:02:17.142 --> 00:02:20.266
such as Einstein described,
where he found the

00:02:20.266 --> 00:02:20.621
consideration of any
scientific problems

00:02:20.621 --> 00:02:22.600
distasteful an entire year?

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:32.144
So reading is a particular
example-- which I'll give you

00:02:32.144 --> 00:02:34.550
another one [INAUDIBLE]--

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.940
of the change and the
effect of the

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.072
formal educational system.

00:02:40.072 --> 00:02:42.930
So in revolutionary America--

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.630
so this is late 1770's--

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.130
Thomas Paine's Common Sense
sold 120,000 copies.

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.422
And their population then
was three million.

00:02:54.422 --> 00:02:58.350
OK, so that's 1/100th of
the population now.

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.626
So the equivalent of 120,000
copies then was about 10

00:03:02.626 --> 00:03:04.660
million or 12 million
copies today.

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.989
Now if you actually look at
Thomas Paine's Common Sense,

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:12.010
it's written in a language,
today, that we

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:12.925
would call very biblical.

00:03:12.925 --> 00:03:16.820
When we read it you use English
and we speak English

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:22.462
but you wouldn't expect 12
million people to buy a book

00:03:22.462 --> 00:03:24.434
of that complexity
and subtlety.

00:03:24.434 --> 00:03:29.857
Now that expectation's is
confirmed by many a study

00:03:29.857 --> 00:03:34.294
about literacy and proficiency
in analyzing documents

00:03:34.294 --> 00:03:36.759
conducted across the
United States.

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:45.562
So the latest one, it was in
2003, National Assessment of

00:03:45.562 --> 00:03:47.044
Adult Literacy.

00:03:47.044 --> 00:03:52.478
So this was published in 2005
by the US government.

00:03:52.478 --> 00:03:56.936
So they America in 2003 and
they tested three kinds of

00:03:56.936 --> 00:03:58.370
proficiencies.

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:02.248
Prose proficiency, which is
comparing viewpoints and two

00:04:02.248 --> 00:04:05.608
editorials as an example of
something where if you have

00:04:05.608 --> 00:04:08.224
prose proficiency you have
document proficiency, which is

00:04:08.224 --> 00:04:10.714
interpreting a table about
blood pressure and any

00:04:10.714 --> 00:04:11.710
physical activity.

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:15.196
So taking information from
doctors and [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:15.196 --> 00:04:18.775
And quantitative proficiency,
computing and comparing the

00:04:18.775 --> 00:04:21.613
cost and analysis
of food items.

00:04:21.613 --> 00:04:23.980
But none of these are very
advanced skills.

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:28.280
OK now, the percentage of adults
who are proficient in

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.510
each of these categories?

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:33.345
13%.

00:04:33.345 --> 00:04:39.490
OK, now, 13% is a very, very
low number especially

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:44.419
considering the level of
proficiency that's required,

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:46.330
the threshold is pretty low.

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:51.675
Whereas back in 1770's America
10 million, 12 million people

00:04:51.675 --> 00:04:54.670
equivalent today bought Thomas
Paine's Common Sense.

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:57.386
And probably many of them were
not actually literate in the

00:04:57.386 --> 00:04:58.700
sense that they couldn't read.

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:01.178
So that book was read to them.

00:05:01.178 --> 00:05:03.299
So there was a great hunger
for words and ideas and

00:05:03.299 --> 00:05:07.366
learning, which in many ways we
had not matched, despite or

00:05:07.366 --> 00:05:12.942
because of the vast extent of
the schooling system and

00:05:12.942 --> 00:05:14.890
educational system.

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:18.476
So suppose you want
to change this.

00:05:18.476 --> 00:05:20.468
You want to improve
the situation.

00:05:20.468 --> 00:05:22.531
You'd like to make
education better.

00:05:22.531 --> 00:05:22.958
What are some of
the obstacles?

00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:28.340
So I'm going to discuss the
obstacles in ascending order

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:32.050
of difficulty in overcoming.

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:37.070
So another way to phrase,
ascending order of

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:38.070
how local they are.

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:41.202
So the first obstacle I'm going
to discuss is one that's

00:05:41.202 --> 00:05:43.667
local to personal psychology.

00:05:43.667 --> 00:05:46.625
It's local to how people
individually act.

00:05:46.625 --> 00:05:48.597
And then I'll move
to obstacles that

00:05:48.597 --> 00:05:50.580
are broader in scope.

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:57.400
So the first obstacle is what
I'll call cognitive

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:58.228
dissonance.

00:05:58.228 --> 00:06:03.390
So the way to see this in action
is suppose you go to

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:07.720
someone and you say, well you
know, the way that that course

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:10.370
is done could really
be improved if

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:11.710
you do it this way.

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:13.960
And you think you've made a
perfectly reasonable point,

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:14.800
perfectly valid point.

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:18.950
But somehow your point isn't
taken any notice of.

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:22.732
Or it's met with resistance
and maybe even hostility.

00:06:22.732 --> 00:06:24.530
Now, why might that be?

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:25.960
Well, there are many reasons.

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:28.880
But one of them is you might
have phrased it badly.

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:31.830
You might have cursed out
somebody's mother while you

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:32.720
were doing it.

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:35.390
There are all kinds of things
that you have a lot of control

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:36.785
over and don't necessarily
have to do.

00:06:36.785 --> 00:06:39.300
But there are some reasons that
are harder to control.

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:41.280
And that's in the psychology
of the person who's hearing

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:43.350
what you're saying.

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:48.914
So one of the obstacles is
this idea of cognitive

00:06:48.914 --> 00:06:49.398
dissonance.

00:06:49.398 --> 00:06:50.366
So let's see how that works.

00:06:50.366 --> 00:06:55.690
So cognitive dissonance was a
concept invented in the 1950's

00:06:55.690 --> 00:07:01.040
by Festinger, Leon Festinger,
psychology at Stanford.

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:02.356
And he did the following
experiments.

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:08.900
The experiments were, he had
people come and do this task

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:13.052
where they basically just put
round pegs into round holes

00:07:13.052 --> 00:07:17.386
and-- he's a college student--
put square pegs into square

00:07:17.386 --> 00:07:19.701
holes and triangle pegs
into triangle holes.

00:07:19.701 --> 00:07:24.310
So after they did the experiment
they were then

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:26.445
split into two groups.

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:38.550
Group A was just sent away.

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:41.934
You know, they did the
experiment and they left and

00:07:41.934 --> 00:07:44.294
nothing more was heard from
them until a year later.

00:07:44.294 --> 00:07:49.828
Now Group B was told, oh, we
actually need people to help

00:07:49.828 --> 00:07:52.760
us recruit more volunteers
for this experiment.

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:56.044
And obviously they might have
problems recruiting people to

00:07:56.044 --> 00:07:58.765
do the experiment because
it was so dull.

00:07:58.765 --> 00:08:01.780
All you do is put square
pegs into square holes.

00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:05.250
So they said would you
be willing to be--

00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:06.640
in the experiment--

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:09.935
our assistant in helping
recruit people?

00:08:09.935 --> 00:08:16.585
So Group A, they
just went away.

00:08:16.585 --> 00:08:19.862
And Group B, they were offered
a position as experimenter's

00:08:19.862 --> 00:08:25.414
assistant and were paid
$20 for that.

00:08:25.414 --> 00:08:27.565
And Group C-- the same thing.

00:08:27.565 --> 00:08:29.820
They were offered a position as
experiment's assistant but

00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:32.154
they were only paid $1.

00:08:36.366 --> 00:08:38.570
This was in 1950-ish.

00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:43.068
So roughly speaking in today's
dollars, let me

00:08:43.068 --> 00:08:44.026
just translate those.

00:08:44.026 --> 00:08:46.900
So here's a way of estimating
the equation.

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:49.774
So in 1950 we still have
the gold standard.

00:08:49.774 --> 00:08:52.648
And the gold standard
was $35 an ounce.

00:08:52.648 --> 00:08:56.381
So the world price of gold was
fixed by Fiat from Bretton

00:08:56.381 --> 00:08:58.836
Woods at $35 an ounce.

00:08:58.836 --> 00:09:00.800
Now it's maybe $70 an ounce.

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:03.255
So inflation is about 25%.

00:09:03.255 --> 00:09:08.165
So this is about 400 today.

00:09:08.165 --> 00:09:11.111
And this is about $20.

00:09:14.090 --> 00:09:19.374
So then what happened was these
students then did their

00:09:19.374 --> 00:09:23.366
work, nothing, this, or that,
being an assistant.

00:09:23.366 --> 00:09:26.526
And then they were tested a year
later about their opinion

00:09:26.526 --> 00:09:27.857
of the experiment.

00:09:27.857 --> 00:09:30.360
So that was actually the
real experiment.

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:32.115
So these students thought--

00:09:32.115 --> 00:09:34.480
like all psychology
experiments--

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:36.510
they were actually helping
recruit people for an

00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:37.360
experiment.

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:38.700
When actually, they were
the experiment.

00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:40.120
They were really the subject.

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:42.620
So a year later they were asked
their opinion of the

00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:45.944
experiment, did you think
it was interesting?

00:09:45.944 --> 00:09:51.666
So these people, they obviously
thought it was

00:09:51.666 --> 00:09:53.508
boring because it
wasn't worth it.

00:09:56.980 --> 00:09:59.304
So a year later these people
were asked what they thought.

00:09:59.304 --> 00:10:01.774
And these people said boring.

00:10:09.184 --> 00:10:13.140
OK, now, what about
Groups B and C?

00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:14.932
What did they think?

00:10:14.932 --> 00:10:18.868
So take a minute or two, try
to predict what they were

00:10:18.868 --> 00:10:22.312
opinions about the experiment
were one year later.

00:10:22.312 --> 00:10:23.296
Question, yes?

00:10:23.296 --> 00:10:26.740
AUDIENCE: So did they have
a choice to participate?

00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:28.708
Were they forced to do this?

00:10:28.708 --> 00:10:29.692
PROFESSOR: No, I don't think
they were forced.

00:10:29.692 --> 00:10:33.136
It was the Group B who
agreed, or the Group

00:10:33.136 --> 00:10:35.104
C people who agreed.

00:10:35.104 --> 00:10:36.334
I'm pretty sure that's right.

00:10:36.334 --> 00:10:37.584
And I'm sure they
weren't forced.

00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:45.237
So yeah, find a neighbor or
two and see if you can

00:10:45.237 --> 00:10:50.651
predict, what did Groups B and
C think after a year or so?

00:10:56.567 --> 00:11:01.990
OK, so, what do you think
they thought?

00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:02.483
Yeah?

00:11:02.483 --> 00:11:05.934
AUDIENCE: Well, maybe Group C
liked the experiment better

00:11:05.934 --> 00:11:09.385
because they were only trying
to recruit, I think they

00:11:09.385 --> 00:11:11.357
wanted to but [INAUDIBLE].

00:11:11.357 --> 00:11:14.810
PROFESSOR: OK, so Group
C maybe liked it more.

00:11:14.810 --> 00:11:16.310
So the question is,
who liked it more?

00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:18.310
So maybe Group C
liked it more.

00:11:24.810 --> 00:11:29.010
So they weren't getting enough
incentive in cash and they

00:11:29.010 --> 00:11:30.260
must have liked it.

00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:38.696
Any other thoughts, comments?

00:11:38.696 --> 00:11:39.138
Yeah?

00:11:39.138 --> 00:11:42.019
AUDIENCE: Well, it's possible
they didn't like it

00:11:42.019 --> 00:11:44.597
originally, but they convinced
themselves they liked it

00:11:44.597 --> 00:11:47.258
because they were doing this
work recruiting for not very

00:11:47.258 --> 00:11:48.007
much money.

00:11:48.007 --> 00:11:49.257
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:04.920
So they must have convinced
themselves because they were

00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:07.630
getting enough cash
to be happy.

00:12:07.630 --> 00:12:09.510
AUDIENCE: I actually
have a question.

00:12:09.510 --> 00:12:10.450
PROFESSOR: Yeah?

00:12:10.450 --> 00:12:12.800
AUDIENCE: So did
[? all of them ?] take over?

00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:14.340
Or are we talking only about
those who did it?

00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:16.410
PROFESSOR: That I
don't remember.

00:12:16.410 --> 00:12:17.854
That's a good question.

00:12:17.854 --> 00:12:18.336
I think we're just talking
about the people

00:12:18.336 --> 00:12:20.264
who took the offer.

00:12:20.264 --> 00:12:23.638
AUDIENCE: OK, so it was
self selection?

00:12:23.638 --> 00:12:24.602
PROFESSOR: Yeah, there's
some self selection.

00:12:24.602 --> 00:12:27.830
AUDIENCE: But if a group came
from that, you probably should

00:12:27.830 --> 00:12:31.016
ask the question immediately
after the experiment before

00:12:31.016 --> 00:12:34.165
asking them to help assist and
then you set the control.

00:12:34.165 --> 00:12:35.900
[INAUDIBLE].

00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:38.367
PROFESSOR: And they might
have done that.

00:12:38.367 --> 00:12:40.315
I don't remember all
the details of it.

00:12:40.315 --> 00:12:40.802
So they might have done that.

00:12:40.802 --> 00:12:42.912
And [? some wonder ?] if the
control was the Group A. But

00:12:42.912 --> 00:12:44.698
you're right, that's another
good control.

00:12:44.698 --> 00:12:47.133
And they might have done that.

00:12:47.133 --> 00:12:49.568
Other comments or questions?

00:12:49.568 --> 00:12:50.055
Predictions?

00:12:50.055 --> 00:12:50.542
Yeah?

00:12:50.542 --> 00:12:55.412
AUDIENCE: Is this a flat rate
or is this a per person?

00:12:55.412 --> 00:12:57.642
PROFESSOR: Oh, per person
they recruited?

00:12:57.642 --> 00:13:00.840
No, this was their salary.

00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:05.080
Yeah, that'd be pretty
lucrative, $20 a pop.

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:05.380
Yeah?

00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:07.696
AUDIENCE: I was thinking B
probably wouldn't have liked

00:13:07.696 --> 00:13:09.590
it as much as C because they
probably would have thought,

00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:12.754
if they have to pay me $400 it's
really, really boring.

00:13:12.754 --> 00:13:23.165
PROFESSOR: OK, so B liked it
less on the theory that they

00:13:23.165 --> 00:13:24.656
were doing it just
for the money.

00:13:24.656 --> 00:13:27.141
They were thinking
to themselves--

00:13:27.141 --> 00:13:31.324
AUDIENCE: Or also if the reason
they really have to pay

00:13:31.324 --> 00:13:33.602
them this much to get the
subjects it must really suck.

00:13:44.536 --> 00:13:45.530
PROFESSOR: Yeah?

00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:47.368
AUDIENCE: Well, and you can
look at it another way.

00:13:47.368 --> 00:13:49.506
You can say, they're paying
me this much money.

00:13:49.506 --> 00:13:52.985
There must be some intrinsic
importance to the work.

00:13:52.985 --> 00:13:55.470
So you could convince
yourself--

00:13:55.470 --> 00:13:56.464
PROFESSOR: it could
go both ways.

00:13:56.464 --> 00:13:57.458
AUDIENCE: Right, exactly.

00:13:57.458 --> 00:13:58.452
PROFESSOR: They pay me
a lot so it must be

00:13:58.452 --> 00:13:58.949
really important work.

00:13:58.949 --> 00:14:00.937
They must have tons of
government funding for people.

00:14:00.937 --> 00:14:01.931
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:14:01.931 --> 00:14:03.422
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:14:03.422 --> 00:14:06.404
So it could be [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:17.055 --> 00:14:17.670
Oh, comment?

00:14:17.670 --> 00:14:20.130
AUDIENCE: Well, I have to say,
I think the process of

00:14:20.130 --> 00:14:24.111
recruiting people would get
you to like it more.

00:14:24.111 --> 00:14:25.979
Because you'd have
to be selling it.

00:14:25.979 --> 00:14:29.620
And then the question is whether
you put more effort

00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:32.656
into that if you're getting
paid more money or not.

00:14:32.656 --> 00:14:36.289
PROFESSOR: OK, but the common
point is recruiting can help

00:14:36.289 --> 00:14:36.584
you like it?

00:14:36.584 --> 00:14:37.834
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:14:50.823 --> 00:14:56.180
PROFESSOR: OK, so I would say
to me, actually, you were

00:14:56.180 --> 00:15:01.080
right, actually, what happened
is that these people still

00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:02.330
found this boring.

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:11.280
And these people liked it.

00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:15.425
And basically, at the time this
was counter intuitive.

00:15:15.425 --> 00:15:18.729
And the whole idea of cognitive
dissonance was built

00:15:18.729 --> 00:15:20.406
up to explain this
counter-intuitive result,

00:15:20.406 --> 00:15:26.322
which is why would you like it
more when you're paid less?

00:15:26.322 --> 00:15:28.146
It is sort of counter
intuitive.

00:15:28.146 --> 00:15:34.680
And it's exactly like you say,
which is that you reason to

00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:39.827
yourself well, if they're giving
me 400, yeah, sure, I'd

00:15:39.827 --> 00:15:41.775
sell my grandmother for 400.

00:15:41.775 --> 00:15:43.966
You know, that doesn't mean
that I don't like my

00:15:43.966 --> 00:15:44.210
grandmother.

00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:47.140
But $400 is $400.

00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:49.995
But if they only
give you $20--

00:15:49.995 --> 00:15:52.330
that's option C--

00:15:52.330 --> 00:15:53.752
no, of course you wouldn't
do that.

00:15:53.752 --> 00:15:56.698
There must be some reason
that you're doing that.

00:15:56.698 --> 00:15:59.807
So if you're participating in
the activity we'll say by

00:15:59.807 --> 00:16:02.862
doing but don't like it,
or at least you try to

00:16:02.862 --> 00:16:03.572
justify it to yourself.

00:16:03.572 --> 00:16:05.136
You need some kind
of justification.

00:16:05.136 --> 00:16:09.751
And the justification of Group
B is well, I'm doing it

00:16:09.751 --> 00:16:10.733
because it pays a
lot of money.

00:16:10.733 --> 00:16:13.351
The justification of Group C
can't be that because there

00:16:13.351 --> 00:16:14.170
isn't enough money.

00:16:14.170 --> 00:16:16.625
So it must be that it's an

00:16:16.625 --> 00:16:18.098
intrinsically worthwhile activity.

00:16:18.098 --> 00:16:20.553
So the opinion shifts.

00:16:20.553 --> 00:16:23.020
Now if you remember, I mentioned
cognitive dissonance

00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:26.580
as one of reasons to have
people vote when you're

00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:30.271
originally doing multiple-choice
questions.

00:16:30.271 --> 00:16:33.037
Give a muiltiple-choice question
to the students, say

00:16:33.037 --> 00:16:37.133
A, B, C, or D. The importance of
having them vote and make a

00:16:37.133 --> 00:16:40.570
public stand is that it commits
them to the question

00:16:40.570 --> 00:16:41.992
and to the answer.

00:16:41.992 --> 00:16:48.210
Now they have some public
appearance in the one of the

00:16:48.210 --> 00:16:50.210
A, B, C, D categories.

00:16:50.210 --> 00:16:52.210
And they want to know,
is this right?

00:16:52.210 --> 00:16:54.710
So the political organizers
know this.

00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:57.710
And these kind of ideas
are old hat now.

00:16:57.710 --> 00:17:00.710
We've seen things that
consciousness and psychology

00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:01.710
in marketing.

00:17:01.710 --> 00:17:04.543
So people will sometimes-- for
example-- come around and ask

00:17:04.543 --> 00:17:07.410
you well, would you mind putting
a sign in your front

00:17:07.410 --> 00:17:09.384
yard for this political
campaign?

00:17:09.384 --> 00:17:12.312
Well, at first they'll say,
would you like to give $100 to

00:17:12.312 --> 00:17:13.776
the campaign?

00:17:13.776 --> 00:17:15.728
And you say, no.

00:17:15.728 --> 00:17:17.913
I don't really know
who XYZ is.

00:17:17.913 --> 00:17:19.920
I sort of maybe support
him $100.

00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:20.420
[INAUDIBLE].

00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:21.420
So you say no.

00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:23.300
They say, OK, well, would you
mind putting a sign in your

00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:24.890
front yard?

00:17:24.890 --> 00:17:26.250
So now, what have you done?

00:17:26.250 --> 00:17:27.065
Made a public commitment.

00:17:27.065 --> 00:17:30.057
All right, everybody who drives
by or walks by sees

00:17:30.057 --> 00:17:31.482
that sign for the candidate.

00:17:31.482 --> 00:17:35.990
So now studies are completely
consistent with this--

00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:40.730
you now do it-- you now support
that candidate more.

00:17:40.730 --> 00:17:45.120
So turns out, what's the key
thing in changing your view?

00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:49.990
Is that you feel you
had a choice.

00:17:49.990 --> 00:17:54.962
So here, if you put a gun to
someone's head and say, put a

00:17:54.962 --> 00:17:55.819
sign in your front yard.

00:17:55.819 --> 00:17:57.190
And they put a sign in their
front yard, that doesn't

00:17:57.190 --> 00:17:59.870
change their view of
the candidate.

00:17:59.870 --> 00:18:01.850
The person could
refuse or not.

00:18:01.850 --> 00:18:03.335
It was up to them.

00:18:03.335 --> 00:18:05.810
If they chose to do it, well,
that opens a door to further

00:18:05.810 --> 00:18:06.305
commitment.

00:18:06.305 --> 00:18:10.265
So here, this is sort of like
putting a gun to their head.

00:18:10.265 --> 00:18:12.740
This is sort of like putting
a gun to their head.

00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:13.730
You don't really feel like
you have a choice.

00:18:13.730 --> 00:18:15.710
You're like, OK, whether it was
boring or not, who cares?

00:18:15.710 --> 00:18:17.690
Whereas here, you
took the choice.

00:18:17.690 --> 00:18:20.660
And the ones that did it
changed their view.

00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:24.170
So cognitive dissonance is
very, very powerful.

00:18:24.170 --> 00:18:26.750
Now, how does that relate to
peoples' response when you

00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:30.325
say, you'd like to change
the course?

00:18:30.325 --> 00:18:31.582
OK, and we'll come to that.

00:18:31.582 --> 00:18:32.058
Yes, question?

00:18:32.058 --> 00:18:36.818
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so again,
Group A then was

00:18:36.818 --> 00:18:37.770
never offered a choice?

00:18:37.770 --> 00:18:39.846
PROFESSOR: Yeah, they
were sent away.

00:18:39.846 --> 00:18:43.210
And they were asked a year
later to see what

00:18:43.210 --> 00:18:44.040
they thought of it.

00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:45.225
And they said, yeah,
it was boring.

00:18:45.225 --> 00:18:46.526
They're sort of control.

00:18:46.526 --> 00:18:48.310
I mean, you expect them
to say, it's boring.

00:18:48.310 --> 00:18:51.546
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:51.546 --> 00:18:52.000
boring?

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.510
PROFESSOR: Yeah, just to check
so no one could say, well,

00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:58.081
maybe people found it
really fascinating.

00:18:58.081 --> 00:18:59.780
You know, because they didn't.

00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:04.480
So now what happens when you say
to someone, oh, we really

00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:05.860
should change the way
this course is done.

00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:10.500
So now suppose you're at some
weak university like MIT or

00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:11.880
Cambridge or something
like that.

00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:13.690
Now, where do a lot of the
people who teach at these

00:19:13.690 --> 00:19:16.380
universities come from?

00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:18.160
Either that same university--

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:21.760
especially in England, that was
really notorious in the

00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:24.840
united justification [? for
it ?], which was that our

00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:27.412
system's so wacky and different,
only people who've

00:19:27.412 --> 00:19:29.290
been through that particular
system can

00:19:29.290 --> 00:19:30.980
possibly teach here.

00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:33.533
So how are the justifications?

00:19:33.533 --> 00:19:38.726
Either the people come from that
same place or come from a

00:19:38.726 --> 00:19:41.550
similar background, similar
university background.

00:19:41.550 --> 00:19:45.670
So now you're not criticizing
a system that

00:19:45.670 --> 00:19:49.964
they A, selected them.

00:19:49.964 --> 00:19:50.372
Right?

00:19:50.372 --> 00:19:53.680
The system selected them from
a whole bunch of people.

00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:58.130
And so by definition, it
must be a good system.

00:19:58.130 --> 00:20:01.130
Also, they've now had many
opportunities to make public

00:20:01.130 --> 00:20:03.498
commitments to the system of the
way things are taught, the

00:20:03.498 --> 00:20:05.050
way things are done.

00:20:05.050 --> 00:20:07.255
They've taught them in classes,
they've participated

00:20:07.255 --> 00:20:08.480
in curriculum discussions.

00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:10.930
They've selected the students
that come, recommended the

00:20:10.930 --> 00:20:12.418
students that would
be better or worse

00:20:12.418 --> 00:20:13.410
according to that system.

00:20:13.410 --> 00:20:17.874
So the result is that because
of years of cognitive

00:20:17.874 --> 00:20:20.354
dissonance working on people,
they are now very, very

00:20:20.354 --> 00:20:24.390
convinced that the way things
are done right now is great.

00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:29.520
And although it's called
cognitive dissonance, it's not

00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:31.020
necessarily a cognitive
belief.

00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:35.020
If you ask them, can you explain
why it's great they

00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:37.110
wouldn't necessarily give
you great reasons.

00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:40.023
And this can be very misleading
and can lead you

00:20:40.023 --> 00:20:40.830
into hot water.

00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:43.888
So for example, when you say,
well, really we should teach

00:20:43.888 --> 00:20:46.286
this course differently and put
in interactive questions

00:20:46.286 --> 00:20:47.774
so students learn them.

00:20:47.774 --> 00:20:52.025
You'll get responses that
are almost nonsense.

00:20:52.025 --> 00:20:56.982
They'll be things like, for
example, well, if we don't put

00:20:56.982 --> 00:20:59.860
everything on the chalkboard how
will students know what's

00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:02.555
going to be on the exam?

00:21:02.555 --> 00:21:06.267
And yeah, it's a valid
English sentence.

00:21:06.267 --> 00:21:08.990
But it's not a good argument
because there are other ways

00:21:08.990 --> 00:21:09.485
to communicate with students.

00:21:09.485 --> 00:21:09.980
You can put stuff on notes.

00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:11.455
You can say, read the book.

00:21:11.455 --> 00:21:13.750
There's tons of answers
to that problem.

00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:17.890
But these kind of things can be
offered as just a complete

00:21:17.890 --> 00:21:18.540
trump card.

00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:21.873
OK, these trumps have been
played, because no one can do

00:21:21.873 --> 00:21:23.816
anything interactive.

00:21:23.816 --> 00:21:27.230
Now, that level of thought
that's behind it, no way

00:21:27.230 --> 00:21:30.220
people would put that level of
thought into their research

00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:31.880
and be successful
with research.

00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:35.183
And how come that's OK
and can be sort of

00:21:35.183 --> 00:21:35.490
convincing in this area?

00:21:35.490 --> 00:21:38.290
Well, because it's really
not a cognitive

00:21:38.290 --> 00:21:39.470
response to be made.

00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:42.730
It's a belief response.

00:21:42.730 --> 00:21:47.736
You threaten and challenge a
person's core beliefs and

00:21:47.736 --> 00:21:49.515
they're going to come out
and react very strongly.

00:21:49.515 --> 00:21:52.400
And if you try to argue it just
on the rational level

00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:55.445
you'll, actually, pick
up angry people.

00:21:55.445 --> 00:21:57.832
And you won't anger yourself
because you wonder why you

00:21:57.832 --> 00:21:59.850
hate the progress.

00:21:59.850 --> 00:22:04.018
So one way to think about those
kinds of conversations

00:22:04.018 --> 00:22:09.982
is A, if they're difficult
conversations--

00:22:13.461 --> 00:22:16.691
and actually, the reason I write
that there is there's an

00:22:16.691 --> 00:22:19.425
excellent book called Difficult
Conversations.

00:22:19.425 --> 00:22:20.419
written by--

00:22:20.419 --> 00:22:22.407
I'm pretty sure-- it's from the

00:22:22.407 --> 00:22:23.440
Harvard Negotiation Project.

00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:26.020
And they said, look, every
interaction-- and I

00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:27.858
think this is right--

00:22:27.858 --> 00:22:29.340
has three levels.

00:22:29.340 --> 00:22:38.232
So that would be the factual
level, which is just the ideas

00:22:38.232 --> 00:22:40.702
being exchanged, of should we
teach interactively or not?

00:22:40.702 --> 00:22:42.184
Is there enough time?

00:22:42.184 --> 00:22:51.404
There's the emotional level,
which is how we feel about

00:22:51.404 --> 00:22:52.930
these facts.

00:22:52.930 --> 00:22:54.720
And then there's the meaning.

00:22:57.310 --> 00:23:00.270
So what does this discussion
mean for people?

00:23:00.270 --> 00:23:04.640
So as an example, [INAUDIBLE],
the problem with a student

00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:05.360
who's worried about
their grade.

00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:08.150
Well, you can tell them,
factually, look--

00:23:08.150 --> 00:23:13.388
about 3% on that problem set is
going to be 0.03% of your

00:23:13.388 --> 00:23:15.270
grade's total points, don't
even worry about it.

00:23:15.270 --> 00:23:17.620
All right, so that's
the factual level.

00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:22.035
You may often find that just the
factual discussion is just

00:23:22.035 --> 00:23:23.270
the tip of the iceberg
because there's all

00:23:23.270 --> 00:23:24.230
this stuff going on.

00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:26.150
So what could some
of this stuff be?

00:23:26.150 --> 00:23:29.373
Well, the emotional level is
they just feel really anxious

00:23:29.373 --> 00:23:31.345
about grades.

00:23:31.345 --> 00:23:33.810
Now, why might that be?

00:23:33.810 --> 00:23:35.720
Well, that's where the
meaning comes in.

00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:39.628
The meaning may be that they
feel that the grade measures

00:23:39.628 --> 00:23:41.062
how good they are.

00:23:41.062 --> 00:23:44.134
And they've always thought they
got into MIT by mistake.

00:23:44.134 --> 00:23:46.110
And now people are going
to find them out.

00:23:46.110 --> 00:23:49.568
If they ever get a bad grade
their cover will be blown.

00:23:49.568 --> 00:23:52.038
And everyone will know that
they don't belong.

00:23:52.038 --> 00:23:54.014
So it may have a really strong
meaning for them, which is

00:23:54.014 --> 00:23:55.002
rather emotional.

00:23:55.002 --> 00:23:57.966
Which means the fact [INAUDIBLE]
discussion

00:23:57.966 --> 00:23:58.460
[INAUDIBLE].

00:23:58.460 --> 00:24:02.906
So it's a similar thing with
the discussion of change in

00:24:02.906 --> 00:24:07.846
education, is that people will
have a factual discussion that

00:24:07.846 --> 00:24:09.822
seems pointless and it's just
frustrating to you.

00:24:09.822 --> 00:24:14.164
Because actually there's
emotional investment in the

00:24:14.164 --> 00:24:15.060
way things are done.

00:24:15.060 --> 00:24:18.400
And meaning, it means
a lot to people.

00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:19.838
This system, it chose them.

00:24:19.838 --> 00:24:22.328
It's a system they're
committed to.

00:24:22.328 --> 00:24:23.822
And it's being criticized
by you.

00:24:23.822 --> 00:24:27.806
Therefore, you're going to get
a whole bunch of unrealized

00:24:27.806 --> 00:24:29.300
anger [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:29.798
Question?

00:24:29.798 --> 00:24:32.288
AUDIENCE: So when it comes to
changing a single class and

00:24:32.288 --> 00:24:35.774
adding some interactivity,
what are the downfalls

00:24:35.774 --> 00:24:39.260
avoiding the difficult
conversations by asking for

00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:40.754
forgiveness rather
than permission?

00:24:40.754 --> 00:24:41.750
PROFESSOR: Nate, that's
a good question.

00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:45.976
So asking for forgiveness rather
than permission, one of

00:24:45.976 --> 00:24:47.630
the downsides is--

00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:57.480
I think, in small and moderate
doses that is a good idea.

00:24:57.480 --> 00:25:00.352
Because first of all, no
one's going to notice.

00:25:00.352 --> 00:25:03.256
Because they're too busy with
their own [INAUDIBLE] teaching

00:25:03.256 --> 00:25:06.160
that that's rather busybody
over what you're doing.

00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:08.570
So you have, definitely,
something right away that you

00:25:08.570 --> 00:25:09.853
might as well use.

00:25:09.853 --> 00:25:13.526
But if you want to make any
larger changes, like for

00:25:13.526 --> 00:25:17.715
example, take out something
that you think isn't so

00:25:17.715 --> 00:25:20.300
important in the curriculums--
and make room for doing this--

00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:22.660
and somebody downstream
really wants that.

00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:25.420
Well, it's important to have
done it beforehand, discuss it

00:25:25.420 --> 00:25:26.010
beforehand.

00:25:26.010 --> 00:25:31.445
Because otherwise, if there's
emotional and meaning

00:25:31.445 --> 00:25:35.260
investment in the way things are
done, they won't be able

00:25:35.260 --> 00:25:36.651
to listen and then
you surprise them

00:25:36.651 --> 00:25:40.230
with a factual change.

00:25:40.230 --> 00:25:41.721
They won't be able to listen
to your factual arguments

00:25:41.721 --> 00:25:43.212
then, because you activated the

00:25:43.212 --> 00:25:45.700
emotional and meaning responses.

00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:48.800
So you want to try to arrange,
[INAUDIBLE] those things

00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:52.210
beforehand and get all those
out in the open first.

00:25:52.210 --> 00:25:55.220
So I would say, for smaller
changes, yeah.

00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:57.560
For larger changes, it's
important to have people

00:25:57.560 --> 00:26:03.370
jointly figure out what to
do, which is true of

00:26:03.370 --> 00:26:05.230
any political change.

00:26:05.230 --> 00:26:10.116
And that's why when I
deliberately chose the title

00:26:10.116 --> 00:26:12.521
Political Barriers to
Educational Change.

00:26:12.521 --> 00:26:15.888
Because political barriers has
the implication that it's a

00:26:15.888 --> 00:26:16.529
political problem.

00:26:16.529 --> 00:26:17.042
It's a social problem.

00:26:17.042 --> 00:26:17.812
It's a collective problem.

00:26:17.812 --> 00:26:22.744
And any collective problems has
these issues of what you

00:26:22.744 --> 00:26:28.600
do by yourself versus what we do
in a group or [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:29.576
Question, yeah?

00:26:29.576 --> 00:26:33.480
AUDIENCE: So I'm just a little
bit confused about the idea of

00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:34.456
cognitive dissonance.

00:26:34.456 --> 00:26:38.067
So is that where the [INAUDIBLE]
between the

00:26:38.067 --> 00:26:39.824
responses of groups B and C?

00:26:39.824 --> 00:26:40.800
PROFESSOR: Mm-hmm.

00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:42.290
Yes, it's that.

00:26:42.290 --> 00:26:44.333
Oh, so where does the dissonance
come into it?

00:26:44.333 --> 00:26:44.908
I should've explained that.

00:26:44.908 --> 00:26:48.250
The dissonance is what
you try to reduce by

00:26:48.250 --> 00:26:49.809
changing your view.

00:26:49.809 --> 00:26:54.060
So in Group B there's really
no dissonance because the

00:26:54.060 --> 00:26:55.550
experiment's boring.

00:26:55.550 --> 00:26:58.678
And they did the recruiting
because they were paid.

00:26:58.678 --> 00:26:59.670
There's no dissonance.

00:26:59.670 --> 00:27:02.710
Here, the experiment is boring,
but they don't have

00:27:02.710 --> 00:27:06.484
the resolution that oh, I'm
being paid to do it.

00:27:06.484 --> 00:27:09.490
So they have to have some way
of reducing that dissonance.

00:27:09.490 --> 00:27:11.823
And they're going out and
recruiting people.

00:27:11.823 --> 00:27:15.591
So the way they do it is they
reduce the dissonance between

00:27:15.591 --> 00:27:18.480
the internal view and external
performance by changing their

00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:19.610
internal view.

00:27:19.610 --> 00:27:20.470
Thanks.

00:27:20.470 --> 00:27:23.395
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:27:23.395 --> 00:27:26.389
AUDIENCE: So I'm wondering
whether--

00:27:26.389 --> 00:27:29.383
do you know how people talk
about how sometimes if you're

00:27:29.383 --> 00:27:31.628
trying to convince people to
do something you try to get

00:27:31.628 --> 00:27:33.874
them to feel like it
was their idea?

00:27:33.874 --> 00:27:38.614
And it seems like that would
be the opposite approach to

00:27:38.614 --> 00:27:40.984
what you were just saying, which
was that you try to get

00:27:40.984 --> 00:27:43.355
people on board in advance maybe
even so subtly that they

00:27:43.355 --> 00:27:44.852
don't even realize it.

00:27:44.852 --> 00:27:47.846
Because I think if you make
people feel like they're being

00:27:47.846 --> 00:27:49.592
threatened and furthermore that
like you're deceiving

00:27:49.592 --> 00:27:53.335
them, but they'll claim to be
always kind of on purpose

00:27:53.335 --> 00:27:56.632
because you felt like you were
backed into a corner.

00:27:56.632 --> 00:27:59.052
And even if they're not
committed to it, because it

00:27:59.052 --> 00:28:02.440
produces them as [INAUDIBLE],
or just because people don't

00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:04.255
like to be fooled, that they
don't like to feel like

00:28:04.255 --> 00:28:05.350
they're taken advantage of.

00:28:05.350 --> 00:28:05.590
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:28:05.590 --> 00:28:07.009
So that's why I would
say, yeah.

00:28:07.009 --> 00:28:09.390
Take advantage of the freedom
that you have that everyone

00:28:09.390 --> 00:28:10.070
sort of [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:10.070 --> 00:28:12.044
to make smaller changes
just on your own.

00:28:12.044 --> 00:28:15.502
AUDIENCE: Do you have ideas
for how you might go about

00:28:15.502 --> 00:28:17.972
[INAUDIBLE], if you see people
with [INAUDIBLE]?

00:28:17.972 --> 00:28:18.470
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:20.265
And not so much convincing
things that

00:28:20.265 --> 00:28:22.740
it's their idea it's--

00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:25.430
yeah, I don't want to phrase it
as people think this as a

00:28:25.430 --> 00:28:26.270
dishonest [INAUDIBLE].

00:28:26.270 --> 00:28:27.252
AUDIENCE: Yeah, yeah.

00:28:27.252 --> 00:28:29.216
PROFESSOR: It's really you're
trying to find collective

00:28:29.216 --> 00:28:33.803
solutions to problems that you
both think are happening, or

00:28:33.803 --> 00:28:34.620
you all think are happening.

00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:36.920
So one way to go about that
is to say, well, look.

00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:38.430
Here is a problem I see.

00:28:38.430 --> 00:28:41.340
What do you think you
could do about it?

00:28:41.340 --> 00:28:43.720
They might agree with
you on the problem.

00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:47.350
By creating one problem, pretty
much generally people

00:28:47.350 --> 00:28:50.010
will say, yeah, the students
are fine with problem set.

00:28:50.010 --> 00:28:52.590
But when they have to go
do something with it,

00:28:52.590 --> 00:28:53.630
they can't do it.

00:28:53.630 --> 00:28:56.168
So you'll get a much wider
grievant on that statement

00:28:56.168 --> 00:28:57.887
than on what to do about it.

00:28:57.887 --> 00:28:59.360
But you can start there.

00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:03.140
Say, OK, well, what do you think
we should do about it?

00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:04.140
They may have some ideas.

00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:06.020
They may accept the idea
that, well, this

00:29:06.020 --> 00:29:07.110
is a serious problem.

00:29:07.110 --> 00:29:08.560
And it's not clear what
to do about it.

00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:12.440
But that right away gives you
some license to try to

00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:12.830
[? external?]

00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:13.610
[INAUDIBLE].

00:29:13.610 --> 00:29:15.380
So you say, OK, well,
here's one thing

00:29:15.380 --> 00:29:16.808
I'm thinking of trying.

00:29:16.808 --> 00:29:18.712
Let's see how it works.

00:29:18.712 --> 00:29:22.213
So you're not saying, it must be
done this way, and this is

00:29:22.213 --> 00:29:24.500
the only way to do it, and
you're bad to not do it.

00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:25.970
Say, well I'm going
to try this.

00:29:25.970 --> 00:29:26.950
Let's see how it works.

00:29:26.950 --> 00:29:28.910
And I'm happy to share
the results with you.

00:29:28.910 --> 00:29:30.870
And you can use that, too.

00:29:30.870 --> 00:29:37.730
And so there's another related
point to that, which is the--

00:29:37.730 --> 00:29:39.820
I don't know what percentage
to give it.

00:29:39.820 --> 00:29:43.100
So let's call it
a 10%, 10%, 8%.

00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:46.397
So 10%, 10%, 8% equals this.

00:29:55.020 --> 00:29:59.720
So 10% of people will
be early adopters.

00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:02.574
They're really curious
about new things.

00:30:02.574 --> 00:30:04.510
They want to try new things.

00:30:04.510 --> 00:30:05.760
Let's call them [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:14.030 --> 00:30:19.700
There will be, say, 10% who no
matter what you do are just

00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:21.310
going to say, this
is terrible.

00:30:21.310 --> 00:30:22.560
So, the never adopters.

00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:31.005
And the 8% who are in the middle
who will wait to see

00:30:31.005 --> 00:30:33.830
and will sort of sit
on the fence but

00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:42.005
[INAUDIBLE], but open.

00:30:42.005 --> 00:30:43.694
They have other priorities,
but they're open to

00:30:43.694 --> 00:30:46.380
these kind of things.

00:30:46.380 --> 00:30:51.290
So my rough rule of thumb is,
when you're talking to

00:30:51.290 --> 00:30:54.724
someone, could be figure out
which category they're in.

00:30:54.724 --> 00:30:58.963
If they're in- this is true of
political discussions, right?

00:30:58.963 --> 00:31:01.540
You probably have some relatives
in the family where

00:31:01.540 --> 00:31:04.566
you just agree we're not going
to talk about politics.

00:31:04.566 --> 00:31:05.554
Right?

00:31:05.554 --> 00:31:07.036
So, I have them.

00:31:07.036 --> 00:31:10.000
I'm sure I'm in some people's
category of that , too.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.470
We just say, we're just not
going to talk about that.

00:31:12.470 --> 00:31:16.422
Because one or the two of us is
not going to adopt the view

00:31:16.422 --> 00:31:18.710
of the other no matter what is
said because you just think

00:31:18.710 --> 00:31:19.960
it's absurd.

00:31:22.220 --> 00:31:25.900
So if someone's in that
category, don't

00:31:25.900 --> 00:31:27.040
even spend any time.

00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:28.510
Just spend your time
[INAUDIBLE]

00:31:28.510 --> 00:31:32.100
category and say, OK, I'm
going to move on.

00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:35.850
If they're in this category,
you usually can figure that

00:31:35.850 --> 00:31:37.200
out pretty quickly, too.

00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:39.049
Work with them.

00:31:39.049 --> 00:31:42.253
And if they're in this category,
that's the people

00:31:42.253 --> 00:31:46.937
you can reach if you do
things in a good way.

00:31:46.937 --> 00:31:49.402
OK, now this is actually
pretty large.

00:31:49.402 --> 00:31:52.853
I think in the '70s this was
called the silent majority,

00:31:52.853 --> 00:31:55.318
was the code for this
[? this word. ?]

00:31:55.318 --> 00:31:55.811
Yeah.

00:31:55.811 --> 00:31:57.820
AUDIENCE: Are you ready
to be done with this?

00:31:57.820 --> 00:31:58.500
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:31:58.500 --> 00:32:00.640
AUDIENCE: Could you talk a
little bit-- maybe a little

00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:04.280
later-- about what sort
of scale changes

00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:05.850
you're talking about?

00:32:05.850 --> 00:32:09.220
And also along with that, how
much power each individual

00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:11.620
professor has to design
their own course.

00:32:11.620 --> 00:32:14.350
If you figure out what the
prerequisites are for the next

00:32:14.350 --> 00:32:18.510
course, then I don't see exactly
what the problem is

00:32:18.510 --> 00:32:21.221
doing whatever you want in your
course as long as you

00:32:21.221 --> 00:32:24.919
meet those-- as long
as you teach them.

00:32:24.919 --> 00:32:28.850
PROFESSOR: So the question is
what size scale change am I

00:32:28.850 --> 00:32:29.920
talking about?

00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:33.680
Well, it depends.

00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:34.940
How much freedom you
have depends on the

00:32:34.940 --> 00:32:36.440
change you want to do.

00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:41.155
For example, suppose you took to
heart some of the readings

00:32:41.155 --> 00:32:43.450
that were for today and you
thought that grading was

00:32:43.450 --> 00:32:47.825
really terrible and you want to
just dispense with grading

00:32:47.825 --> 00:32:49.380
completely.

00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:53.285
Well, even if you're teaching
all the right stuff, that will

00:32:53.285 --> 00:32:54.680
raise a lot of of ire.

00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:57.420
And people will come after you
for that even if you're

00:32:57.420 --> 00:32:59.490
teaching everything right and
you're doing all the prereq.

00:32:59.490 --> 00:33:04.500
Because it will trigger all
kinds of factual, emotional,

00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:06.040
meaning responses
in other people.

00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:09.400
And it'll go against many,
many-- and that's what I'm

00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:10.840
going to talk about next is--

00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:14.045
features of American society
to think we must

00:33:14.045 --> 00:33:15.266
do things that way.

00:33:15.266 --> 00:33:18.050
So you have less freedom to do
something like that, even if

00:33:18.050 --> 00:33:20.740
you're meeting all
the prereqs.

00:33:20.740 --> 00:33:23.157
Now, if you want to, for
example, use different

00:33:23.157 --> 00:33:25.258
examples to teach the
same ideas, Everyone

00:33:25.258 --> 00:33:26.900
wants complete freedom.

00:33:26.900 --> 00:33:29.113
So it really depends what
you want to do.

00:33:29.113 --> 00:33:32.740
Then there's many scales where
you can make change.

00:33:32.740 --> 00:33:35.750
So you may find that there isn't
any way to do what I

00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:39.164
want to do and meet all the
prereqs for the next course,

00:33:39.164 --> 00:33:41.888
because it just means doing
way too much stuff.

00:33:41.888 --> 00:33:44.111
OK, well now you have
a problem of a

00:33:44.111 --> 00:33:45.350
bigger scale change.

00:33:45.350 --> 00:33:49.690
How do you get the whole group
of faculty or group of people

00:33:49.690 --> 00:33:52.270
in charge of that area or course
to change what was

00:33:52.270 --> 00:33:55.985
going on and changes the
prerequisites, change the

00:33:55.985 --> 00:33:56.960
overall curriculum.

00:33:56.960 --> 00:33:58.618
So now, you're definitely going
to be working with lots

00:33:58.618 --> 00:34:00.225
of other people.

00:34:00.225 --> 00:34:04.202
There's another sort of
dichotomy, which is is the

00:34:04.202 --> 00:34:06.110
course required or not?

00:34:06.110 --> 00:34:10.090
If the course isn't required,
you have much more freedom.

00:34:10.090 --> 00:34:10.770
[INAUDIBLE]

00:34:10.770 --> 00:34:12.219
so your course.

00:34:12.219 --> 00:34:14.570
If people don't like it, they
don't have to take it.

00:34:14.570 --> 00:34:17.184
And even if other people don't
like your course or don't

00:34:17.184 --> 00:34:19.420
think it's that important,
they're perfectly happy,

00:34:19.420 --> 00:34:21.349
generally, to let you teach
the course that they don't

00:34:21.349 --> 00:34:22.239
think is that important.

00:34:22.239 --> 00:34:24.512
Because they want to teach their
course, which you may

00:34:24.512 --> 00:34:26.836
think is not that important.

00:34:26.836 --> 00:34:29.492
But now the required courses
that every single undergrad

00:34:29.492 --> 00:34:32.650
that majors in the fields take,
those generally are

00:34:32.650 --> 00:34:34.812
guarded more with jealousy.

00:34:34.812 --> 00:34:38.040
And so changes in those are
harder and generally require

00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:43.270
more consent from other people
just because it's considered a

00:34:43.270 --> 00:34:46.858
shared core of the field.

00:34:46.858 --> 00:34:48.232
So that's the meaning.

00:34:48.232 --> 00:34:51.048
And by changing that, you're
complicitly perhaps

00:34:51.048 --> 00:34:53.478
threatening to share
core of the field.

00:34:53.478 --> 00:34:56.394
Does that answer
your question?

00:35:00.768 --> 00:35:05.000
OK, so what I'm going to talk
about after the break--

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:07.840
so this was the idea
of cognitive

00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:11.360
dissonance, and what role--

00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:15.500
and maybe just a few, your
local group, maybe your

00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:18.880
department, maybe
your school--

00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:21.155
difficulties and obstacles and
issues that come up when

00:35:21.155 --> 00:35:23.460
you're trying to make some kind
of educational change.

00:35:23.460 --> 00:35:25.690
What I'm going to talk about
after the break is

00:35:25.690 --> 00:35:28.170
society-wide features.

00:35:28.170 --> 00:35:28.915
All right.

00:35:28.915 --> 00:35:32.594
So American society or say,
European-American society in

00:35:32.594 --> 00:35:36.995
general, that impose really
large obstacles

00:35:36.995 --> 00:35:38.250
in educational change.

00:35:38.250 --> 00:35:40.186
In some ways, even bigger
than this one.

00:35:40.186 --> 00:35:42.320
And you definitely want to take
your time with this one.

00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:44.130
But it's also important to
take your time with even

00:35:44.130 --> 00:35:45.320
larger scale ones.

00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:51.310
And those will be Behaviorism,
Taylorism, and the history and

00:35:51.310 --> 00:35:52.475
the purpose of those schools.

00:35:52.475 --> 00:35:54.471
And we'll talk about those
after the break.

00:35:54.471 --> 00:35:56.467
It's 9:58 right now.

00:35:56.467 --> 00:35:59.461
So we'll start at 10:08
according to that clock.

00:36:06.946 --> 00:36:10.850
The first barrier, cognitive
dissonancy is a--

00:36:10.850 --> 00:36:13.150
to a personal psychology.

00:36:13.150 --> 00:36:18.007
But now we're going to look
at factors that span the

00:36:18.007 --> 00:36:18.220
individual.

00:36:18.220 --> 00:36:20.986
I mean, this spans the
individual in the sense that

00:36:20.986 --> 00:36:24.816
it's the common feature of our
psychology, maybe of this

00:36:24.816 --> 00:36:26.244
[INAUDIBLE] psychology.

00:36:26.244 --> 00:36:30.528
But let's see it in
individual people.

00:36:30.528 --> 00:36:34.260
But they're are also features
that are common across--

00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:37.874
you could call them social
psychology or social

00:36:37.874 --> 00:36:40.160
tendencies.

00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:42.435
The first one is Behaviorism.

00:36:45.855 --> 00:36:51.555
Behaviorism is also a school
of psychology, which,

00:36:51.555 --> 00:36:54.135
basically in America, grew
out of Pavlov's work on

00:36:54.135 --> 00:36:59.550
conditioning dogs and working on
teaching patience by reward

00:36:59.550 --> 00:37:01.774
and punishment.

00:37:01.774 --> 00:37:08.440
And in psychology, what it was
is it was a focus on outputs.

00:37:08.440 --> 00:37:12.810
So it basically denied the
importance of studying what's

00:37:12.810 --> 00:37:17.510
going on inside the
human mind.

00:37:17.510 --> 00:37:22.250
It was correlated with what
was called the logical

00:37:22.250 --> 00:37:24.222
positivism in the
Vienna school.

00:37:24.222 --> 00:37:29.130
So in Europe, around the same
time and soon after, was the

00:37:29.130 --> 00:37:31.054
rise of quantum mechanics.

00:37:31.054 --> 00:37:34.036
So if you look at quantum
mechanics, quantum mechanics

00:37:34.036 --> 00:37:37.710
was created partly by the Vienna
logical positivists in

00:37:37.710 --> 00:37:38.510
math in [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:38.510 --> 00:37:41.645
In quantum mechanics what's one
of the fundamental ideas

00:37:41.645 --> 00:37:43.830
is what's called an observer.

00:37:43.830 --> 00:37:45.280
You know, where it says, look.

00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:47.490
Don't talk about what's
not observable.

00:37:47.490 --> 00:37:49.380
The important thing is
what's observable.

00:37:49.380 --> 00:37:53.050
Everything is sort of rigid
around observance.

00:37:53.050 --> 00:37:55.030
All right, so behaviorist
psychology was

00:37:55.030 --> 00:37:56.115
almost in the same way.

00:37:56.115 --> 00:37:57.833
It says, look, don't talk
about the mind.

00:37:57.833 --> 00:37:59.216
We don't know what
the mind is.

00:37:59.216 --> 00:38:00.600
It has no separate existence.

00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:02.170
Let's just talk about
behaviors.

00:38:02.170 --> 00:38:07.936
How does what you do effect
what the organism does?

00:38:07.936 --> 00:38:14.146
It's a fine way of training
pigeons, but it's not a great

00:38:14.146 --> 00:38:17.900
way of understanding people.

00:38:17.900 --> 00:38:21.880
But you can see that it's
actually dominant in lots of

00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:23.040
American education.

00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:26.440
So Behaviorism was actually
strongest in America, It was

00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:31.453
eventually, I would say,
demolished as an intellectual

00:38:31.453 --> 00:38:36.374
movement basically
in this space.

00:38:36.374 --> 00:38:39.176
I guess the old linguistic
department was here.

00:38:39.176 --> 00:38:44.900
And Noam Chomsky in 1957, '59
wrote the review of Skinner's

00:38:44.900 --> 00:38:46.865
book on Behaviorism.

00:38:46.865 --> 00:38:51.222
And that's considered the coup
de grace of Behaviorism.

00:38:51.222 --> 00:38:53.673
But even then, the
idea lives on.

00:38:53.673 --> 00:38:56.880
And it underlies so much of what
goes on in this school.

00:38:56.880 --> 00:39:00.555
And you can see that with
actually the lively examples

00:39:00.555 --> 00:39:01.780
of that, given the core.

00:39:01.780 --> 00:39:03.740
I'll give you one more
of that [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:03.740 --> 00:39:06.260
So this was a study.

00:39:06.260 --> 00:39:12.929
This was fourth, fifth,
and sixth grade.

00:39:12.929 --> 00:39:15.670
And they were asked what's
six times three.

00:39:15.670 --> 00:39:18.250
Well, they weren't having a
problem with that, It's 18.

00:39:18.250 --> 00:39:24.732
They were asked to make
a story problem for 6

00:39:24.732 --> 00:39:26.384
times 3 equals 18.

00:39:30.446 --> 00:39:33.864
80% of the students
could not do it.

00:39:33.864 --> 00:39:36.650
They couldn't make a valid
story problem.

00:39:36.650 --> 00:39:38.873
Now, what I mean by story
problem is a word problem.

00:39:38.873 --> 00:39:40.580
So they could actually do
the multiplication.

00:39:40.580 --> 00:39:41.510
That was no problem.

00:39:41.510 --> 00:39:45.310
But to make a problem which used
that multiplication, that

00:39:45.310 --> 00:39:48.650
was difficult for them.

00:39:48.650 --> 00:39:51.774
Most of the problems they came
up with were along this line.

00:39:58.990 --> 00:40:05.386
On Monday, Johnny
buys six apples.

00:40:05.386 --> 00:40:07.354
It's always Johnny, not John.

00:40:07.354 --> 00:40:08.604
I don't know why.

00:40:12.766 --> 00:40:15.226
On Tuesday, Johnny buys
three apples.

00:40:21.622 --> 00:40:26.460
So 6 times 3 equals 18.

00:40:26.460 --> 00:40:30.955
There's was a fundamental lack
of understanding of what's

00:40:30.955 --> 00:40:33.170
going on here behind
the equation.

00:40:33.170 --> 00:40:34.391
So the performance was fine.

00:40:34.391 --> 00:40:36.350
He said, what's 6 times 3?

00:40:36.350 --> 00:40:39.042
18.

00:40:39.042 --> 00:40:41.850
And so the observable
was [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:41.850 --> 00:40:43.795
So by the [INAUDIBLE] standards
that was fine.

00:40:43.795 --> 00:40:44.980
There was no problem.

00:40:44.980 --> 00:40:47.428
And so much of it was
on the school.

00:40:47.428 --> 00:40:50.236
Bacon just looks at
the outreach.

00:40:50.236 --> 00:40:54.180
Whereas, if you actually look
into the [INAUDIBLE], that

00:40:54.180 --> 00:40:58.396
Behaviorists say you shouldn't
really do, and ask the tougher

00:40:58.396 --> 00:41:00.330
[? question, you'll ?] find
it actually has no meat.

00:41:00.330 --> 00:41:02.108
But it's just like tissue.

00:41:02.108 --> 00:41:05.384
AUDIENCE: Is the problem here
me, or is it we are looking

00:41:05.384 --> 00:41:06.788
for the wrong outputs?

00:41:06.788 --> 00:41:11.836
I don't see, per se, how asking
students to make a word

00:41:11.836 --> 00:41:15.438
problem is looking into the mind
any deeper than asking

00:41:15.438 --> 00:41:18.141
them 6 times 3 equals 18 because
it's an output that's

00:41:18.141 --> 00:41:19.798
closer to what we
want students to

00:41:19.798 --> 00:41:21.048
actually be able to do.

00:41:24.414 --> 00:41:28.110
PROFESSOR: The thing is if they
this, if they produce a

00:41:28.110 --> 00:41:31.610
correct story as a formula
too, then you wouldn't be

00:41:31.610 --> 00:41:32.320
happy either.

00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:35.012
So in some way you want
to know does this

00:41:35.012 --> 00:41:37.270
have meaning for them.

00:41:37.270 --> 00:41:40.095
So you could then say, well,
6 times 3 is 18.

00:41:40.095 --> 00:41:42.306
OK, they understood that.

00:41:42.306 --> 00:41:45.270
Now, I want them to
give me the right

00:41:45.270 --> 00:41:46.548
output of a story problem.

00:41:46.548 --> 00:41:49.512
Well, I have them memorize
a correct story problem.

00:41:49.512 --> 00:41:51.363
Whenever they see
multiplication, do this kind

00:41:51.363 --> 00:41:52.980
of story problem.

00:41:52.980 --> 00:41:55.686
And then, if you ask them the
question give me a story

00:41:55.686 --> 00:41:57.918
problem, they would produce
the right output.

00:41:57.918 --> 00:41:58.910
But you'd still be unhappy.

00:41:58.910 --> 00:42:01.555
You'd have to ask a different
question to figure out if it

00:42:01.555 --> 00:42:03.870
actually had any meat.

00:42:03.870 --> 00:42:09.350
Maybe for example you'd say,
well, multiplication's pretty

00:42:09.350 --> 00:42:12.740
similar to division, so let me
see if they could make a story

00:42:12.740 --> 00:42:13.990
problem for division.

00:42:13.990 --> 00:42:16.550
Or let me give them a
different question,

00:42:16.550 --> 00:42:18.020
which is this one.

00:42:18.020 --> 00:42:20.796
Suppose they hadn't had this
question before and hadn't

00:42:20.796 --> 00:42:22.046
been pigeon trained with it.

00:42:34.190 --> 00:42:37.260
So you could give them that
question and see if they

00:42:37.260 --> 00:42:39.414
understood what really
multiplication means.

00:42:39.414 --> 00:42:42.153
If they just write down 73,
you would say, OK, they

00:42:42.153 --> 00:42:42.900
understood that.

00:42:42.900 --> 00:42:45.537
And it would be kind of
pointless to try and have them

00:42:45.537 --> 00:42:46.630
memorize all questions
like this.

00:42:46.630 --> 00:42:50.130
But after they've seen this kind
of question, yeah, they

00:42:50.130 --> 00:42:51.930
might produce the
right output.

00:42:51.930 --> 00:42:54.641
If you just tell them, OK,
whenever you see this, one,

00:42:54.641 --> 00:42:59.050
two, three, four guys here and
four there, produce 73 here.

00:42:59.050 --> 00:43:01.630
Well, that's different from
really in understanding

00:43:01.630 --> 00:43:02.820
multiplication.

00:43:02.820 --> 00:43:06.731
So I would say output
is not sufficient.

00:43:06.731 --> 00:43:10.070
So you have to look
behind the output.

00:43:10.070 --> 00:43:12.280
Did that help answer
your question?

00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:14.470
AUDIENCE: Well, but I feel
like you're still looking

00:43:14.470 --> 00:43:16.972
[INAUDIBLE] but the difference
is the process you used to get

00:43:16.972 --> 00:43:19.828
the students to the point where
they can generate that.

00:43:19.828 --> 00:43:20.780
PROFESSOR: No.

00:43:20.780 --> 00:43:22.684
Well, you're looking at the
output, because that's all you

00:43:22.684 --> 00:43:23.170
can look at.

00:43:23.170 --> 00:43:31.290
But you're not saying if the
output is fine, it's--

00:43:31.290 --> 00:43:34.320
you're making inferences about
what's going behind that.

00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:36.470
And that's what behaviorists
don't want.

00:43:36.470 --> 00:43:38.800
You're saying, oh, there's
understanding, there's

00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:43.259
meaning, there's reasoning going
on beyond the output.

00:43:43.259 --> 00:43:44.918
And that's what the Behaviorists
don't want to

00:43:44.918 --> 00:43:45.480
talk about.

00:43:45.480 --> 00:43:47.875
They just want to talk about
just the outputs.

00:43:47.875 --> 00:43:50.300
And that's a fundamental
problem.

00:43:50.300 --> 00:43:51.895
Because real understanding--

00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:57.520
focus on just outputs leads
to rote learning.

00:43:57.520 --> 00:44:00.760
And I think that is one
explanation for why there's so

00:44:00.760 --> 00:44:04.814
much rote learning produced in
the American education system.

00:44:04.814 --> 00:44:06.308
AUDIENCE: Does anyone--

00:44:10.292 --> 00:44:13.280
[INAUDIBLE]

00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:14.276
[? location ?]

00:44:14.276 --> 00:44:15.770
[INAUDIBLE]

00:44:15.770 --> 00:44:18.758
making the contributions
[INAUDIBLE] like understanding

00:44:18.758 --> 00:44:21.248
a problem, [INAUDIBLE].

00:44:26.760 --> 00:44:31.620
So what's the operation for
that that's different from

00:44:31.620 --> 00:44:32.110
making up problem.

00:44:32.110 --> 00:44:37.350
Making up a problem requires
more understanding, right?

00:44:37.350 --> 00:44:37.800
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:39.467
Making up a problem does
require a lot of

00:44:39.467 --> 00:44:40.778
understanding.

00:44:40.778 --> 00:44:41.215
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:41.215 --> 00:44:46.500
So society wise, you only need
a person to solve the problem

00:44:46.500 --> 00:44:49.010
not make up a problem, right?

00:44:49.010 --> 00:44:54.010
PROFESSOR: Well, that's
not the purpose of--

00:44:54.010 --> 00:44:56.560
so do mean prompt people
to just solve

00:44:56.560 --> 00:44:58.320
problems or make up problems?

00:44:58.320 --> 00:45:00.010
That can't be the premise
on [INAUDIBLE]

00:45:00.010 --> 00:45:02.080
democratic society.

00:45:02.080 --> 00:45:02.575
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:45:02.575 --> 00:45:03.070
OK.

00:45:03.070 --> 00:45:04.555
I agree with that.

00:45:04.555 --> 00:45:08.020
But why should [INAUDIBLE]?

00:45:08.020 --> 00:45:09.010
PROFESSOR: Pardon?

00:45:09.010 --> 00:45:10.990
AUDIENCE: Who's happy to
choose the computation?

00:45:10.990 --> 00:45:13.955
They know that 6
times 3 is 18.

00:45:13.955 --> 00:45:15.205
[INAUDIBLE].

00:45:17.915 --> 00:45:18.905
PROFESSOR: Well,
so it depends.

00:45:18.905 --> 00:45:22.370
So on the [INAUDIBLE] in many
schools there's tests that

00:45:22.370 --> 00:45:23.860
just test things like that.

00:45:23.860 --> 00:45:25.602
[INAUDIBLE] .

00:45:25.602 --> 00:45:30.465
So the No Child Left Behind Act
has pretty much mandated

00:45:30.465 --> 00:45:32.505
that children be tested
pretty regularly

00:45:32.505 --> 00:45:35.394
on their basic skills.

00:45:35.394 --> 00:45:38.140
And so there's a ton of
questions and things like that

00:45:38.140 --> 00:45:39.510
on these basic skills tests.

00:45:39.510 --> 00:45:41.750
So some people care.

00:45:41.750 --> 00:45:46.180
And these kind of tests are an
impediment to making any kind

00:45:46.180 --> 00:45:47.784
of educational change.

00:45:47.784 --> 00:45:52.664
Because if you start spending
time on things like that,

00:45:52.664 --> 00:45:56.640
well, then you have less time
to practice three-digit by

00:45:56.640 --> 00:45:57.890
five-digit multiplication.

00:46:00.750 --> 00:46:03.812
AUDIENCE: Now this
[INAUDIBLE].

00:46:03.812 --> 00:46:07.796
We should say [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:07.796 --> 00:46:12.278
point first, and then from there
break it down to the

00:46:12.278 --> 00:46:13.274
[INAUDIBLE]

00:46:13.274 --> 00:46:16.262
much more [INAUDIBLE]
than [INAUDIBLE].

00:46:23.234 --> 00:46:24.728
PROFESSOR: That may be true.

00:46:24.728 --> 00:46:27.218
So the comment was that maybe
it's better to try something

00:46:27.218 --> 00:46:29.210
not so hard as making
up a story problem.

00:46:29.210 --> 00:46:29.708
Identify--

00:46:29.708 --> 00:46:33.730
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] the
[INAUDIBLE] that we need.

00:46:33.730 --> 00:46:35.070
PROFESSOR: It shouldn't
be that hard.

00:46:35.070 --> 00:46:36.400
AUDIENCE: I mean, we're
on a skill, right?

00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:38.142
PROFESSOR: It shouldn't be that
hard, but it is hard if

00:46:38.142 --> 00:46:40.158
you've just done drill.

00:46:40.158 --> 00:46:40.625
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:46:40.625 --> 00:46:42.026
If you start so low--

00:46:42.026 --> 00:46:42.493
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:46:42.493 --> 00:46:42.960
I agree.

00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:45.370
So it's not saying that
all of a sudden now--

00:46:45.370 --> 00:46:47.605
I'm not saying all of a sudden
now you should ask what we're

00:46:47.605 --> 00:46:49.500
doing with this question how
to make a story problem.

00:46:49.500 --> 00:46:53.333
But this is used as an example
to show how far away we are

00:46:53.333 --> 00:46:54.583
from where we'd like to be.

00:46:57.190 --> 00:47:03.820
So Behaviorism is, I would say
branded reward and punishment,

00:47:03.820 --> 00:47:07.740
pretty much rampant in
American society.

00:47:07.740 --> 00:47:11.415
In discussions of merit pay for
teachers, OK, should we

00:47:11.415 --> 00:47:14.845
give teachers higher pay if
their students do better on

00:47:14.845 --> 00:47:17.050
tests from No Child
Left Behind?

00:47:17.050 --> 00:47:21.010
So that is the assumption that
you want more output from the

00:47:21.010 --> 00:47:22.480
teacher in that [INAUDIBLE].

00:47:22.480 --> 00:47:23.460
You just pay more money.

00:47:23.460 --> 00:47:25.420
You give them more
pigeon food.

00:47:25.420 --> 00:47:29.340
But there actually maybe other
reasons going on, there may be

00:47:29.340 --> 00:47:32.990
completely other factors
besides input output.

00:47:32.990 --> 00:47:35.636
For example, maybe teachers
think we shouldn't be teaching

00:47:35.636 --> 00:47:37.548
the test this way.

00:47:37.548 --> 00:47:40.655
Maybe there's all kinds of
social consideration which

00:47:40.655 --> 00:47:47.305
aren't included in just paying
people quote "meritly." So you

00:47:47.305 --> 00:47:50.419
could see how rampant it is
because when you say, oh no,

00:47:50.419 --> 00:47:51.762
we shouldn't do that
to teachers, people

00:47:51.762 --> 00:47:53.850
think you're crazy.

00:47:53.850 --> 00:47:56.476
They say, well, of course we
should-- and then they make a

00:47:56.476 --> 00:47:58.620
really, really long argument
for why we shouldn't.

00:47:58.620 --> 00:48:01.755
So the default is, yeah,
everything should be paid

00:48:01.755 --> 00:48:03.502
according to results and
rewards, and rewarding

00:48:03.502 --> 00:48:04.500
according to result.

00:48:04.500 --> 00:48:04.999
Yeah.

00:48:04.999 --> 00:48:06.995
AUDIENCE: I'm curious about what
you think-- because I do

00:48:06.995 --> 00:48:09.989
think that there is no question
that in our society

00:48:09.989 --> 00:48:12.650
things in which we give respect
to and value as a

00:48:12.650 --> 00:48:15.727
society do get paid more and
[INAUDIBLE] to have more

00:48:15.727 --> 00:48:18.840
perspective as we [INAUDIBLE]
our educational system is that

00:48:18.840 --> 00:48:21.074
we don't pay our teachers
anything and

00:48:21.074 --> 00:48:21.714
don't respect them.

00:48:21.714 --> 00:48:24.427
And that's why very few people
actually consider that as a

00:48:24.427 --> 00:48:25.546
real career.

00:48:25.546 --> 00:48:27.470
[INAUDIBLE]

00:48:27.470 --> 00:48:30.272
you know, [INAUDIBLE]
to actually consider

00:48:30.272 --> 00:48:31.206
teaching at my school.

00:48:31.206 --> 00:48:32.607
Very [INAUDIBLE] rate.

00:48:32.607 --> 00:48:34.020
And that's because it's
not respected.

00:48:34.020 --> 00:48:36.970
It's not considered a
challenging [INAUDIBLE].

00:48:36.970 --> 00:48:40.645
But don't you think that the
amount of money that people

00:48:40.645 --> 00:48:43.340
get paid actually does in some
sense request our respect for

00:48:43.340 --> 00:48:44.390
them as a society?

00:48:44.390 --> 00:48:45.340
PROFESSOR: That I agree with.

00:48:45.340 --> 00:48:48.440
So there's the meaning
[INAUDIBLE].

00:48:48.440 --> 00:48:51.460
Yeah, there's meaning associated
with the salary.

00:48:51.460 --> 00:48:55.475
So the problem, what's wrong
with merit pay is that the

00:48:55.475 --> 00:48:58.050
meaning is that you're competing
with other teachers.

00:48:58.050 --> 00:49:01.114
I'll give some money to the
schools and say, now dole it

00:49:01.114 --> 00:49:02.110
out among your teachers.

00:49:02.110 --> 00:49:03.106
And the one's who do best---

00:49:03.106 --> 00:49:03.604
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:49:03.604 --> 00:49:04.600
No, I think that's
[INAUDIBLE].

00:49:04.600 --> 00:49:06.810
PROFESSOR: But I agree with
you about increasing the

00:49:06.810 --> 00:49:09.113
overall salaries for teachers.

00:49:09.113 --> 00:49:11.987
And it's exactly right what
you say that it's not

00:49:11.987 --> 00:49:15.140
respected as a profession
in this country.

00:49:15.140 --> 00:49:18.535
And as you say, people who get a
Ph.D from MIT are not likely

00:49:18.535 --> 00:49:21.445
to teach in high school,
which is, I think, sad.

00:49:21.445 --> 00:49:22.950
But it doesn't have
to be that way.

00:49:22.950 --> 00:49:24.200
So in Europe--

00:49:24.200 --> 00:49:27.006
so George Collier, one of the
greatest mathematicians of the

00:49:27.006 --> 00:49:29.148
century, he taught at
a Swiss high school.

00:49:29.148 --> 00:49:32.606
It was a considered a very
respectable position and

00:49:32.606 --> 00:49:33.594
profession.

00:49:33.594 --> 00:49:35.076
It's a serious profession.

00:49:35.076 --> 00:49:37.546
It's really important.

00:49:37.546 --> 00:49:39.870
Whereas, that's pretty
much unheard of here.

00:49:39.870 --> 00:49:42.156
And [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:42.156 --> 00:49:45.130
So it's a combination of
respect and salary.

00:49:45.130 --> 00:49:48.195
And related to that, autonomy.

00:49:48.195 --> 00:49:50.885
So teachers here in America
generally have the least

00:49:50.885 --> 00:49:54.760
autonomy compared to, say,
Western European countries.

00:49:54.760 --> 00:49:57.423
So one way of measuring that
is just how much free time

00:49:57.423 --> 00:49:59.778
teachers have to do curriculum
[INAUDIBLE].

00:49:59.778 --> 00:50:01.662
So think back to your
own high school.

00:50:01.662 --> 00:50:04.730
How many classes did
your teacher teach?

00:50:04.730 --> 00:50:06.232
Typically, six a day.

00:50:06.232 --> 00:50:09.606
I mean, I'm exhausted if I
teach two classes today.

00:50:09.606 --> 00:50:12.498
Because it really takes energy
to teach a class really well,

00:50:12.498 --> 00:50:16.780
think about it, prepare, answer
questions, follow up

00:50:16.780 --> 00:50:19.390
with what happened, and
make references.

00:50:19.390 --> 00:50:21.540
Teaching six times
a day is absurd.

00:50:21.540 --> 00:50:24.692
And all you can do is
just try to survive.

00:50:24.692 --> 00:50:27.584
So that's, again, another
barrier to educational change.

00:50:27.584 --> 00:50:31.882
So that is barrier number
two which is--

00:50:31.882 --> 00:50:34.342
the second we'll call
the [INAUDIBLE].

00:50:48.610 --> 00:50:53.530
So it's the focus on outputs
and reward and punishment.

00:50:53.530 --> 00:50:58.500
And then the next barrier is
another social wide factor

00:50:58.500 --> 00:51:00.840
called Taylorism.

00:51:00.840 --> 00:51:02.690
So Taylor--

00:51:02.690 --> 00:51:06.268
it's related a bit
to Behaviorism.

00:51:06.268 --> 00:51:11.238
So Frederick Taylor was
a mechanical engineer.

00:51:11.238 --> 00:51:12.232
Let's see, when did he live?

00:51:12.232 --> 00:51:17.202
About 1850ish to about
1915 or 1920.

00:51:17.202 --> 00:51:20.200
1856 to 1915.

00:51:20.200 --> 00:51:22.460
So what he did--

00:51:22.460 --> 00:51:27.130
he's the originator of time
and motion studies.

00:51:27.130 --> 00:51:30.260
So time and motion studies
watch how someone, for

00:51:30.260 --> 00:51:33.470
example, is riveting
bolts onto a car.

00:51:33.470 --> 00:51:36.638
And you watch every single
movement and you optimize it.

00:51:36.638 --> 00:51:39.235
And you say, oh, actually if
you have the screwdriver on

00:51:39.235 --> 00:51:42.482
this side, well then when the
car door comes down this way

00:51:42.482 --> 00:51:45.079
you can do this with much
shorter movement than trying

00:51:45.079 --> 00:51:46.870
to do that.

00:51:46.870 --> 00:51:49.367
So they said you can break every
task down with a lots of

00:51:49.367 --> 00:51:52.420
little little fragments
you can optimize.

00:51:52.420 --> 00:51:57.160
Now, this basically took the
whole country by storm in the

00:51:57.160 --> 00:51:59.096
1910s or so.

00:51:59.096 --> 00:52:00.740
Now, how did that happen?

00:52:00.740 --> 00:52:03.908
Well, this was a time of
industrial unrest.

00:52:07.320 --> 00:52:09.920
And unions were striking
demanded higher wages.

00:52:09.920 --> 00:52:16.472
And there was the Interstate
Commerce Commission, which

00:52:16.472 --> 00:52:17.670
regulated the railroad fares.

00:52:17.670 --> 00:52:22.180
And so the railroad attorney,
Louis Brandeis, later Supreme

00:52:22.180 --> 00:52:24.802
Court Justice, argued the in
front of the Interstate

00:52:24.802 --> 00:52:28.760
Commerce Commission, well,
actually we don't have to

00:52:28.760 --> 00:52:30.110
raise fares.

00:52:30.110 --> 00:52:34.455
And we can actually give the
unions some of what they want

00:52:34.455 --> 00:52:36.656
without doing any of
that provided we

00:52:36.656 --> 00:52:38.592
implement Taylor's system.

00:52:38.592 --> 00:52:43.500
So the idea of Taylor's system
was a way of basically trying

00:52:43.500 --> 00:52:48.784
to prevent the unions from
striking, but not distribute

00:52:48.784 --> 00:52:52.090
any of the wealth for
management, but just make

00:52:52.090 --> 00:52:53.660
things more efficient.

00:52:53.660 --> 00:52:58.482
So it was what we now call
the Cult of Efficiency.

00:52:58.482 --> 00:53:03.440
And this Cult of Efficiency I
would say probably could only

00:53:03.440 --> 00:53:07.190
happen in a frontier society,
like America.

00:53:07.190 --> 00:53:11.591
So there's a completely
fascinating book, which I

00:53:11.591 --> 00:53:24.305
highly recommend reading, The
Great Frontier, by Walter

00:53:24.305 --> 00:53:27.270
Prescott Webb.

00:53:27.270 --> 00:53:30.780
So what he looks at is he
looks at the effect on

00:53:30.780 --> 00:53:35.334
European society of the European
discovery of the

00:53:35.334 --> 00:53:39.180
Americas, so around 1500 BC.

00:53:39.180 --> 00:53:41.470
Columbus sailed and all the
explorers were going a sail.

00:53:41.470 --> 00:53:42.370
So what happened?

00:53:42.370 --> 00:53:46.430
Well, before 1500 Europe was
extremely crowded, lots of

00:53:46.430 --> 00:53:51.100
people, very few resources, very
little land, pretty much

00:53:51.100 --> 00:53:54.680
deforested, not much fuel.

00:53:54.680 --> 00:53:56.720
And so it was a hard
place to live.

00:53:59.480 --> 00:54:02.890
With the discovery of the new
world, that switched.

00:54:02.890 --> 00:54:06.618
There was now a ton of land
and not enough people,

00:54:06.618 --> 00:54:10.524
especially after the Indians
all got small pox and died.

00:54:10.524 --> 00:54:14.680
There was a ton of natural
resources-- wood, minerals,

00:54:14.680 --> 00:54:16.250
eventually oil.

00:54:16.250 --> 00:54:21.409
So around 1500, so the world
society changed.

00:54:21.409 --> 00:54:22.816
At least the European society.

00:54:22.816 --> 00:54:26.440
And with it, changed conceptions
of how society

00:54:26.440 --> 00:54:28.460
should work.

00:54:28.460 --> 00:54:33.018
And in the frontier societies,
basically everything was there

00:54:33.018 --> 00:54:34.148
for the taking.

00:54:34.148 --> 00:54:36.084
You just had to work
to get it.

00:54:36.084 --> 00:54:39.956
So in a frontier society,
basically work was a religion.

00:54:39.956 --> 00:54:42.860
That was the religion of
a frontier society.

00:54:42.860 --> 00:54:45.050
And you can still see
that in America.

00:54:45.050 --> 00:54:47.856
How many weeks of holidays
do people have completely

00:54:47.856 --> 00:54:48.840
guaranteed?

00:54:48.840 --> 00:54:51.300
I think zero.

00:54:51.300 --> 00:54:54.517
And whereas in-- for example,
England, I think it was four

00:54:54.517 --> 00:54:56.274
weeks, maybe statutory
minimum.

00:54:56.274 --> 00:54:59.148
In Germany, it's five
or six weeks.

00:54:59.148 --> 00:55:02.980
So in the frontier society, work
will be your religion.

00:55:02.980 --> 00:55:08.411
And it's likely to be placed
where ideas such as Taylorism

00:55:08.411 --> 00:55:11.610
will grow, and sprout,
and thrive.

00:55:11.610 --> 00:55:15.708
So Taylorism spread throughout
the entire country, including

00:55:15.708 --> 00:55:17.904
to the schools.

00:55:17.904 --> 00:55:19.368
And you can still see
it in school.

00:55:19.368 --> 00:55:23.272
School is considered
a factory.

00:55:23.272 --> 00:55:25.712
And the inputs are
the students.

00:55:25.712 --> 00:55:28.152
And we want to do that as
efficiently as possible.

00:55:28.152 --> 00:55:32.285
Think class size, giant
buildings to [INAUDIBLE]

00:55:32.285 --> 00:55:36.130
to produce more product
at the end.

00:55:36.130 --> 00:55:40.004
So this is one of the early
examples of a Taylor school.

00:55:42.840 --> 00:55:44.650
The Platoon School.

00:55:44.650 --> 00:55:46.730
So this was an elementary
school.

00:55:46.730 --> 00:55:48.170
What they did was they--

00:55:48.170 --> 00:55:49.420
this is absurd.

00:55:52.500 --> 00:55:56.750
They enrolled 10% to 70% more
children than there were seats

00:55:56.750 --> 00:55:57.510
for in the classrooms.

00:55:57.510 --> 00:55:59.382
So [INAUDIBLE]

00:55:59.382 --> 00:56:00.786
efficiency.

00:56:00.786 --> 00:56:04.795
This is done by dumping the 10%
to 70% on the playground,

00:56:04.795 --> 00:56:06.510
into the auditorium
or basement.

00:56:06.510 --> 00:56:09.608
So by keeping all the children
rotating from room to room,

00:56:09.608 --> 00:56:13.560
teacher to teacher, so that
the same 10% to 70%

00:56:13.560 --> 00:56:16.030
[INAUDIBLE] way longer than 30
consecutive minutes to get

00:56:16.030 --> 00:56:18.994
into classrooms.

00:56:18.994 --> 00:56:21.796
So even the 6-year-old children
have 6 or 7 teachers

00:56:21.796 --> 00:56:25.270
a day and as many as 12
or 13 in some cities.

00:56:25.270 --> 00:56:27.340
And teachers handle as many as
400 people through the day and

00:56:27.340 --> 00:56:28.450
1,000 a week.

00:56:28.450 --> 00:56:31.950
So the terrorists came to the
school and said, hey, look,

00:56:31.950 --> 00:56:36.030
these schools-- it's all very
relevant to have small schools

00:56:36.030 --> 00:56:37.880
for people, but really,
it's not efficient.

00:56:37.880 --> 00:56:40.220
Look, there's all this
inefficiency you could squeeze

00:56:40.220 --> 00:56:41.820
out of the system.

00:56:41.820 --> 00:56:44.710
And so you can see probably
MIT's going to be going

00:56:44.710 --> 00:56:47.578
through something like that with
the budget cuts, all the

00:56:47.578 --> 00:56:49.490
[INAUDIBLE].

00:56:49.490 --> 00:56:50.860
And trying to squeeze
the life--

00:56:50.860 --> 00:56:54.270
I mean, the inefficiencies
out of the place.

00:56:54.270 --> 00:56:56.574
So what they said was they said,
oh, look, there are all

00:56:56.574 --> 00:56:59.382
these rooms that aren't
being used.

00:56:59.382 --> 00:57:01.645
You have the gym that's
not used all the time.

00:57:01.645 --> 00:57:04.760
There's the lunch room that's
only used at lunch time.

00:57:04.760 --> 00:57:05.450
That's crazy.

00:57:05.450 --> 00:57:07.756
There's an empty room there.

00:57:07.756 --> 00:57:10.690
There's the playground that's
only used at recess.

00:57:10.690 --> 00:57:12.034
What we should do is we
should rotate the

00:57:12.034 --> 00:57:13.135
kids all the way through.

00:57:13.135 --> 00:57:15.820
And you'll actually see
that in schools now.

00:57:15.820 --> 00:57:19.430
Many of them have lunch period
that starts at 10:00 AM, and

00:57:19.430 --> 00:57:23.020
the lunch period goes till
almost 2:00, because it's a

00:57:23.020 --> 00:57:25.960
much more efficient use
of the lunch room.

00:57:25.960 --> 00:57:29.145
But ironically, they had to
cancel recess, because recess

00:57:29.145 --> 00:57:30.370
is inefficient.

00:57:30.370 --> 00:57:33.800
Recess is not efficient for
doing standardized test

00:57:33.800 --> 00:57:35.440
problems, so you guys will
see that as well.

00:57:35.440 --> 00:57:37.678
So again, they called
it efficiency.

00:57:37.678 --> 00:57:40.123
That was back in the
'20s [INAUDIBLE].

00:57:40.123 --> 00:57:43.383
It's from Raymond Callahan's
book called Education and the

00:57:43.383 --> 00:57:46.480
Cult of Efficiency: A Study of
the Social Forces that have

00:57:46.480 --> 00:57:48.925
Shaped the Administration
of Public School.

00:57:48.925 --> 00:57:52.348
It's about Taylorism in
the public schools.

00:57:52.348 --> 00:57:54.304
But it continues to today.

00:57:54.304 --> 00:57:56.680
In No Child Left Behind,
you can see is a

00:57:56.680 --> 00:57:57.764
perfect example of it.

00:57:57.764 --> 00:57:59.150
[INAUDIBLE]

00:57:59.150 --> 00:58:02.107
wrote, he said, "The long lines
of marching children

00:58:02.107 --> 00:58:04.775
that look to be like nothing
so much as the lines of

00:58:04.775 --> 00:58:08.412
uncompleted Ford cars in the
factory, moving always on with

00:58:08.412 --> 00:58:11.322
a screw put on or a [INAUDIBLE]
tighten as they

00:58:11.322 --> 00:58:13.020
passed-- standardized,
mechanical, pitiful.

00:58:13.020 --> 00:58:15.320
When the factory system carried
into the public

00:58:15.320 --> 00:58:18.856
school, which needs only the
closing time whistle to make

00:58:18.856 --> 00:58:21.832
complete [INAUDIBLE] with
giant, great industrial

00:58:21.832 --> 00:58:22.824
plants."

00:58:22.824 --> 00:58:25.800
So there you have another
fundamentally

00:58:25.800 --> 00:58:29.272
important social factor.

00:58:29.272 --> 00:58:30.264
[INAUDIBLE].

00:58:30.264 --> 00:58:33.736
So behaviorism and Taylorism are
sort of lumped together.

00:58:37.230 --> 00:58:40.940
Which is the joining of the
school and the factory and the

00:58:40.940 --> 00:58:43.910
educational system and
the social order.

00:58:51.400 --> 00:58:54.121
So that I'll call the social
history of education.

00:59:10.710 --> 00:59:13.439
So education-- and America was
one of the leading countries

00:59:13.439 --> 00:59:17.870
in this, in making schools
free and required--

00:59:17.870 --> 00:59:20.510
compulsory free education.

00:59:20.510 --> 00:59:22.650
[INAUDIBLE] public school.

00:59:22.650 --> 00:59:26.030
So this-- in Massachusetts,
actually-- our state was the

00:59:26.030 --> 00:59:29.680
leading state in American
[INAUDIBLE].

00:59:29.680 --> 00:59:33.830
And so Horace Mann
in the 1840s--

00:59:33.830 --> 00:59:37.410
he was one of the leading
educational reformers.

00:59:37.410 --> 00:59:39.540
And he was arguing
to businessmen.

00:59:39.540 --> 00:59:42.800
OK, you really should be willing
to have higher taxes

00:59:42.800 --> 00:59:44.720
to make schools free
and required.

00:59:44.720 --> 00:59:49.332
Now, why would businesses want
to part with their profits to

00:59:49.332 --> 00:59:50.190
pay for schools?

00:59:50.190 --> 00:59:55.285
But he says, look, there's all
these benefits from schools.

00:59:55.285 --> 00:59:58.968
The schooled workers are more
docile and quick in applying

00:59:58.968 --> 01:00:00.588
themselves to work.

01:00:00.588 --> 01:00:03.900
They had better domestic and
social habits, you know,

01:00:03.900 --> 01:00:04.870
punctuality and fidelity.

01:00:04.870 --> 01:00:07.480
They have higher punctuality
and fidelity in the

01:00:07.480 --> 01:00:08.950
performance of their duties.

01:00:08.950 --> 01:00:13.150
So basically, he was arguing
for school as a method of

01:00:13.150 --> 01:00:14.372
social control.

01:00:14.372 --> 01:00:18.184
Now, there was a strange feature
in my high school,

01:00:18.184 --> 01:00:21.523
which I never understood till
I actually read about this.

01:00:21.523 --> 01:00:24.623
History of Horace Mann called
the School of America, which

01:00:24.623 --> 01:00:28.080
was that-- so I experienced
this first-hand.

01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:32.287
One day in my high school, this
racist student attacked

01:00:32.287 --> 01:00:34.850
me and called me nasty names.

01:00:34.850 --> 01:00:36.670
And so when I fought back--

01:00:36.670 --> 01:00:40.194
and we sort of fought to a draw,
which was good because

01:00:40.194 --> 01:00:43.500
he was trying to do
serious damage.

01:00:43.500 --> 01:00:47.310
As a result, the school policy
was that whoever was in the

01:00:47.310 --> 01:00:50.670
fight was suspended
for three days.

01:00:50.670 --> 01:00:52.932
So we were both automatically
suspended, and then had to go

01:00:52.932 --> 01:00:55.340
to court to figure out who
was really at fault.

01:00:55.340 --> 01:00:57.116
But by then, of course,
I'd already been

01:00:57.116 --> 01:00:58.650
suspended for two days.

01:00:58.650 --> 01:01:01.080
So I was suspended for three
days and I got to find out,

01:01:01.080 --> 01:01:02.770
what are the policies when
you miss school?

01:01:02.770 --> 01:01:04.110
So it was very interesting.

01:01:04.110 --> 01:01:09.590
So first of all, if you're late
to school three times in

01:01:09.590 --> 01:01:13.790
a quarter, then you fail
for that quarter.

01:01:13.790 --> 01:01:17.138
If you fail in the second
quarter of a semester, you

01:01:17.138 --> 01:01:18.442
fail the semester.

01:01:18.442 --> 01:01:21.050
If you fail in the second
semester of a course, you fail

01:01:21.050 --> 01:01:22.660
the entire year.

01:01:22.660 --> 01:01:25.320
And if you failed a required
course, like English--

01:01:25.320 --> 01:01:28.036
math or English required-- then
you failed the entire

01:01:28.036 --> 01:01:30.436
year and had to repeat
the whole grade.

01:01:30.436 --> 01:01:32.640
OK, so they were very, very,
very sticklers about

01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:34.030
punctuality.

01:01:34.030 --> 01:01:35.470
But they didn't really
care what your

01:01:35.470 --> 01:01:36.860
grades were that much.

01:01:36.860 --> 01:01:39.480
You could get C's and D's on
tests and you'd do much better

01:01:39.480 --> 01:01:41.217
than if you missed four
days of school.

01:01:41.217 --> 01:01:43.085
Now, my teachers were
nice in this case.

01:01:43.085 --> 01:01:44.490
Said, no, don't worry
about it.

01:01:44.490 --> 01:01:46.580
Good thing you fought and
stood up for yourself.

01:01:46.580 --> 01:01:48.950
We won't do any of that stuff.

01:01:48.950 --> 01:01:52.706
So it was always puzzling to me
why punctuality was so much

01:01:52.706 --> 01:01:55.500
more important in this public
school, which was supposed to

01:01:55.500 --> 01:01:57.525
be one of the leading public
schools [INAUDIBLE], than the

01:01:57.525 --> 01:02:01.800
actual grades you got and
how much you learned.

01:02:01.800 --> 01:02:04.180
When I read the history
of Horace Mann, I

01:02:04.180 --> 01:02:05.575
thought, oh, yeah.

01:02:05.575 --> 01:02:06.970
That actually made
perfect sense.

01:02:06.970 --> 01:02:09.680
The purpose of the school wasn't
necessarily to teach

01:02:09.680 --> 01:02:11.280
people to think and
really understand.

01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:15.735
The social history behind it was
to produce people who are

01:02:15.735 --> 01:02:18.705
basically docile workers for the
factory system, which was

01:02:18.705 --> 01:02:27.130
just coming around
in the 1840s.

01:02:27.130 --> 01:02:29.703
So there were many comments
along those lines.

01:02:29.703 --> 01:02:32.168
One of the arguments also for
the school was similar.

01:02:32.168 --> 01:02:37.230
It was a resolution that the
best police for our cities,

01:02:37.230 --> 01:02:40.467
the lowest insurance of our
houses, the permanent security

01:02:40.467 --> 01:02:43.450
for our banks, the most
effective means of preventing

01:02:43.450 --> 01:02:46.282
pauperism, vice, and crime, and
the only sure defense of

01:02:46.282 --> 01:02:48.480
our country are our
common schools.

01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:52.770
They mean the public, free
schools that are required.

01:02:52.770 --> 01:02:55.160
So again, it's seen
as a defense

01:02:55.160 --> 01:02:58.900
of property, basically.

01:02:58.900 --> 01:03:02.145
This was true-- so when I say
America, it's not just

01:03:02.145 --> 01:03:03.180
America, actually.

01:03:03.180 --> 01:03:06.750
England in 1870 passed an
education act that required

01:03:06.750 --> 01:03:08.424
public schooling.

01:03:08.424 --> 01:03:10.860
[INAUDIBLE].

01:03:10.860 --> 01:03:15.020
And the arguments in England
were almost exactly the same.

01:03:15.020 --> 01:03:17.357
"Would not the policemen be
better employed in assisting

01:03:17.357 --> 01:03:20.437
the work of the school master by
collecting [INAUDIBLE] for

01:03:20.437 --> 01:03:22.575
school attendance the willfully
neglected children

01:03:22.575 --> 01:03:29.625
who are [INAUDIBLE] recruits for
the great army of crime."

01:03:29.625 --> 01:03:32.295
We wanted to prevent the working
classes from engaging

01:03:32.295 --> 01:03:35.169
in those vain strikes which end
in 99 out of 100 leaving

01:03:35.169 --> 01:03:38.043
them in worse condition
than before.

01:03:38.043 --> 01:03:39.835
We wanted to keep them from
habits of waste and

01:03:39.835 --> 01:03:41.883
improvidence that some knowledge
of the succession of

01:03:41.883 --> 01:03:44.300
events in life, such as
education could supply.

01:03:44.300 --> 01:03:48.182
So in other words, education
has a class role.

01:03:48.182 --> 01:03:52.670
So that history of education,
it still permeates it.

01:03:52.670 --> 01:03:54.140
And people were very
open about this.

01:03:54.140 --> 01:03:57.612
These weren't secret documents
that people wrote in their

01:03:57.612 --> 01:03:58.108
conspiratory council.

01:03:58.108 --> 01:04:01.580
These were openly discussed,
saying this is why you should

01:04:01.580 --> 01:04:03.068
pay for schools.

01:04:03.068 --> 01:04:05.480
I would say it was even quite
a soph-- reached quite a

01:04:05.480 --> 01:04:07.035
sophisticated level.

01:04:07.035 --> 01:04:10.760
So William Whewell, he was
master of Trinity College,

01:04:10.760 --> 01:04:14.852
Cambridge, in the
1860s, I think.

01:04:14.852 --> 01:04:18.489
So when he was a university
professor, before becoming

01:04:18.489 --> 01:04:20.778
master at Trinity, he was
commenting on the difference

01:04:20.778 --> 01:04:23.810
between the European and the,
say, English and American

01:04:23.810 --> 01:04:25.013
educational system.

01:04:25.013 --> 01:04:28.155
And he said, well, actually,
they had [INAUDIBLE]

01:04:28.155 --> 01:04:28.650
problem in Europe.

01:04:28.650 --> 01:04:30.610
And the problem [INAUDIBLE].

01:04:30.610 --> 01:04:33.024
So he was recommending the
teaching of mathematics.

01:04:33.024 --> 01:04:34.952
He said, "The mathematical
doctrines

01:04:34.952 --> 01:04:36.398
were fixed and permanent.

01:04:36.398 --> 01:04:39.772
No new system of geometry
can supersede the old.

01:04:39.772 --> 01:04:41.700
Not only so, but even the old
books remain in use."

01:04:41.700 --> 01:04:46.167
So now contrasting that, "The
fixed and constant nature of

01:04:46.167 --> 01:04:48.662
mathematics was not likely to
promote the critical spirit

01:04:48.662 --> 01:04:49.161
[INAUDIBLE]

01:04:49.161 --> 01:04:52.155
France and Germany, where too
much attention to the more

01:04:52.155 --> 01:04:55.149
provisional and contentious
observational sciences had

01:04:55.149 --> 01:04:58.143
been partly responsible for the
imminent general hostility

01:04:58.143 --> 01:05:01.137
to the existing institutions
in their country."

01:05:01.137 --> 01:05:04.090
So in other words, we should
teach mathematics because it

01:05:04.090 --> 01:05:05.630
has one answer.

01:05:05.630 --> 01:05:06.680
[INAUDIBLE]

01:05:06.680 --> 01:05:08.600
conclude about society, too.

01:05:08.600 --> 01:05:11.960
It has the one answer, which
is the society we have.

01:05:11.960 --> 01:05:15.295
Whereas, if you teach
observational sciences, social

01:05:15.295 --> 01:05:18.410
sciences, people might start
questioning way too much.

01:05:18.410 --> 01:05:20.810
So there was not just schools,
but what should we teach in

01:05:20.810 --> 01:05:23.110
our schools?

01:05:23.110 --> 01:05:28.850
So that history is very, very
hard to overcome because it's

01:05:28.850 --> 01:05:33.302
so deeply embedded into the
foundation of a school.

01:05:33.302 --> 01:05:36.170
We will find its purpose
is like that.

01:05:36.170 --> 01:05:38.321
Such purposes keep creeping
up whenever you

01:05:38.321 --> 01:05:40.010
try to change things.

01:05:40.010 --> 01:05:43.090
So there are all kinds of things
that are crazy in the

01:05:43.090 --> 01:05:45.973
schools that we do that you
don't necessarily need to do

01:05:45.973 --> 01:05:46.642
in the school.

01:05:46.642 --> 01:05:48.073
For example, grading.

01:05:48.073 --> 01:05:51.412
Why do schools have to grade?

01:05:51.412 --> 01:05:54.240
People think, oh, well, how
will other people know?

01:05:54.240 --> 01:05:57.000
If other people want to know
what students can do, let them

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:57.920
worry about it.

01:05:57.920 --> 01:05:59.760
Why does the school
have to do that?

01:05:59.760 --> 01:06:01.240
Sure, it's school.

01:06:01.240 --> 01:06:04.174
It could tell students, look
you're not learning this idea

01:06:04.174 --> 01:06:06.130
very well, you could spend
more time on that.

01:06:06.130 --> 01:06:07.597
You're learning this
idea really good.

01:06:07.597 --> 01:06:08.880
You don't need to spend
any more time on that.

01:06:08.880 --> 01:06:11.430
That kind of evaluation, for
the student's benefit, is

01:06:11.430 --> 01:06:11.960
quite useful.

01:06:11.960 --> 01:06:15.420
But why should that be
publicized to other people?

01:06:15.420 --> 01:06:17.850
Well, those are two separate
questions, but they're

01:06:17.850 --> 01:06:20.300
automatically conflated
because-- partly, the purpose

01:06:20.300 --> 01:06:24.540
of the school is to get
people to accept their

01:06:24.540 --> 01:06:26.714
place in the society.

01:06:26.714 --> 01:06:30.158
There was a very interesting
experiment along those lines.

01:06:30.158 --> 01:06:30.650
I don't know if you know it.

01:06:30.650 --> 01:06:33.110
It was blues eyes, brown eyes.

01:06:33.110 --> 01:06:36.680
So this is related to tracking
and grading.

01:06:36.680 --> 01:06:38.590
So I don't think you could
do this experiment today.

01:06:38.590 --> 01:06:40.300
But what they was they took--

01:06:40.300 --> 01:06:42.810
I think it was third graders.

01:06:42.810 --> 01:06:46.760
And they came into the
class and they said,

01:06:46.760 --> 01:06:47.900
OK, you third graders.

01:06:47.900 --> 01:06:51.135
We've just found out that the
blue-eyed children are more

01:06:51.135 --> 01:06:52.582
intelligent than brown-eyed
children.

01:06:52.582 --> 01:06:54.852
And so we're going to have
to teach them separately.

01:06:54.852 --> 01:06:59.110
So they then separated into two
classrooms and they taught

01:06:59.110 --> 01:07:01.380
them exactly the same stuff.

01:07:01.380 --> 01:07:04.770
And then they tested them a
while later and they found the

01:07:04.770 --> 01:07:07.927
blue-eyed children did much,
much better than the

01:07:07.927 --> 01:07:08.921
brown-eyed children.

01:07:08.921 --> 01:07:12.897
So sure, the test results
must have been correct.

01:07:12.897 --> 01:07:15.382
Actually what they did is
afterwards they said,

01:07:15.382 --> 01:07:17.370
actually, no we fucked up--

01:07:17.370 --> 01:07:17.867
sorry.

01:07:17.867 --> 01:07:20.849
[LAUGHTER]

01:07:20.849 --> 01:07:22.340
We screwed up.

01:07:22.340 --> 01:07:24.120
And actually, we got
it backwards.

01:07:24.120 --> 01:07:26.710
It was the brown-eyed children
who were more intelligent than

01:07:26.710 --> 01:07:27.550
the blue-eyed children.

01:07:27.550 --> 01:07:28.970
So we had to switch
the classrooms.

01:07:28.970 --> 01:07:30.222
So they switched
the classrooms.

01:07:30.222 --> 01:07:33.198
And of course, they taught them
exactly the same stuff.

01:07:33.198 --> 01:07:35.690
And what do you think happened
[INAUDIBLE]?

01:07:35.690 --> 01:07:37.696
They flipped.

01:07:37.696 --> 01:07:39.774
That's an example
of the effect of

01:07:39.774 --> 01:07:43.150
tracking and grading.

01:07:43.150 --> 01:07:46.940
So what's the result of that is
that, well, students then

01:07:46.940 --> 01:07:48.140
accept their place.

01:07:48.140 --> 01:07:49.050
They think, oh, yeah.

01:07:49.050 --> 01:07:51.450
I am the dumb student.

01:07:51.450 --> 01:07:52.910
I am the bad reader.

01:07:52.910 --> 01:07:54.770
Oh, I'm just not so
good at math.

01:07:54.770 --> 01:07:56.630
It's my fault.

01:07:56.630 --> 01:07:58.960
Rather than-- well, it's
the way it's taught.

01:07:58.960 --> 01:08:04.660
It's that I came from a family
where we just didn't have much

01:08:04.660 --> 01:08:05.240
money, even for food.

01:08:05.240 --> 01:08:08.210
And the society just didn't
provide that, so I was

01:08:08.210 --> 01:08:09.900
hungry every day.

01:08:09.900 --> 01:08:13.185
So there's all kinds of social
explanations which you're

01:08:13.185 --> 01:08:16.260
taught not to look at.

01:08:16.260 --> 01:08:19.340
And even the very problems that
are done in school tend

01:08:19.340 --> 01:08:22.765
to reinforce the social
order that we have.

01:08:22.765 --> 01:08:25.270
So an example of that, to really
show how strong that

01:08:25.270 --> 01:08:28.930
tendency is, is look at the
problems that are done about

01:08:28.930 --> 01:08:29.908
percentages.

01:08:29.908 --> 01:08:33.820
The percentage problems are
always of the following form.

01:08:33.820 --> 01:08:39.890
Johnny has $1,000 which he lends
to Jane at 6% interest.

01:08:39.890 --> 01:08:43.739
How much interest does Jane
pay after two years?

01:08:43.739 --> 01:08:44.950
Well, there's many interesting
features about that.

01:08:44.950 --> 01:08:46.514
First of all, Johnny
makes the money.

01:08:46.514 --> 01:08:48.834
The guy has the money
and not the woman.

01:08:48.834 --> 01:08:51.010
The woman is the borrower.

01:08:51.010 --> 01:08:55.310
So now, with feminism, we've
made it so that Jane

01:08:55.310 --> 01:08:56.140
can have the money.

01:08:56.140 --> 01:08:58.240
But you haven't changed the
fundamental problem, which is

01:08:58.240 --> 01:08:59.960
that the problem is
reinforcing the

01:08:59.960 --> 01:09:01.847
idea of money lending.

01:09:01.847 --> 01:09:02.845
[INAUDIBLE].

01:09:02.845 --> 01:09:05.340
What about the following
problem, which you never see,

01:09:05.340 --> 01:09:06.790
which is also [INAUDIBLE]

01:09:06.790 --> 01:09:08.040
interesting percentage problem?

01:09:10.816 --> 01:09:14.790
The hourly minimum wage
is $7 an hour.

01:09:14.790 --> 01:09:18.454
If somebody works 40 hours a
week, what's their salary?

01:09:18.454 --> 01:09:20.318
OK, it's this much.

01:09:20.318 --> 01:09:22.649
It's roughly $14,000 a year.

01:09:22.649 --> 01:09:24.990
What percentage of the
federal poverty line

01:09:24.990 --> 01:09:26.595
is $14,000 a year?

01:09:26.595 --> 01:09:29.728
That's an equally interesting
percentage problem, but it has

01:09:29.728 --> 01:09:31.897
a different social message.

01:09:31.897 --> 01:09:34.789
So the schools have chosen,
basically [INAUDIBLE] social

01:09:34.789 --> 01:09:38.060
pressures that push towards one
kind of problem, one kind

01:09:38.060 --> 01:09:40.779
of grading, one kind
of system.

01:09:40.779 --> 01:09:42.997
And this is despite what people

01:09:42.997 --> 01:09:44.488
know about these things.

01:09:44.488 --> 01:09:47.967
So blue eyes, brown eyes
experiment shows what's the

01:09:47.967 --> 01:09:49.458
detrimental effect
[INAUDIBLE].

01:09:49.458 --> 01:09:52.440
Many people say, well, actually,
[INAUDIBLE].

01:09:52.440 --> 01:09:54.925
Another example is tracking.

01:09:54.925 --> 01:09:58.410
So tracking where people
know that it's harmful.

01:09:58.410 --> 01:10:01.790
So a friend of mine in New
York, he went to an elite

01:10:01.790 --> 01:10:02.646
private school.

01:10:02.646 --> 01:10:04.926
It's a small, elite
private school.

01:10:04.926 --> 01:10:07.416
And one year they decided
to introduce tracking.

01:10:07.416 --> 01:10:11.649
So tracking is advanced math,
median math, OK math, and

01:10:11.649 --> 01:10:12.396
remedial math.

01:10:12.396 --> 01:10:19.060
And after a year, there was
a parental revolt and they

01:10:19.060 --> 01:10:20.144
abolished it.

01:10:20.144 --> 01:10:21.566
The parents said, this
is outrageous.

01:10:21.566 --> 01:10:24.751
We're not paying $25,000 a year
for you to tell our kid

01:10:24.751 --> 01:10:27.910
that our kid is not
intelligent.

01:10:27.910 --> 01:10:29.513
Get rid of it.

01:10:29.513 --> 01:10:31.445
Whereas, it's considered
perfectly acceptable to do

01:10:31.445 --> 01:10:34.350
that to kids in public
schools.

01:10:34.350 --> 01:10:36.538
So people know, yet
the thing goes on.

01:10:36.538 --> 01:10:40.450
So whenever you see something
like that happening, you can

01:10:40.450 --> 01:10:44.362
bet there's some really deeply
embedded social history--

01:10:44.362 --> 01:10:46.807
the purposes of the schools.

01:10:46.807 --> 01:10:49.712
And related to the social
history is the social history

01:10:49.712 --> 01:10:50.180
of our society.

01:10:50.180 --> 01:10:54.295
So these tendencies, they're
not immutable.

01:10:54.295 --> 01:10:57.656
All social factors have changed
in the past and all of

01:10:57.656 --> 01:10:59.090
them can change again.

01:10:59.090 --> 01:11:02.570
But in order to change them,
It's important to be aware.

01:11:02.570 --> 01:11:03.556
You have a question?

01:11:03.556 --> 01:11:04.049
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:11:04.049 --> 01:11:06.514
I just had a question with the
whole concepts of getting the

01:11:06.514 --> 01:11:08.979
grades, which I can see is
a benefit in some ways.

01:11:08.979 --> 01:11:12.430
But I feel like [INAUDIBLE]

01:11:12.430 --> 01:11:15.388
to just stop grading children,
I feel like at least at the

01:11:15.388 --> 01:11:18.839
level of college acceptance,
there's still going to be some

01:11:18.839 --> 01:11:24.445
level of evaluating
the children.

01:11:24.445 --> 01:11:28.405
And eventually, it's just going
to be that some other

01:11:28.405 --> 01:11:31.705
form of evaluation is leading
to this separation, even if

01:11:31.705 --> 01:11:33.850
it's not just by numbers.

01:11:33.850 --> 01:11:35.100
Saying [INAUDIBLE].

01:11:41.275 --> 01:11:44.245
And is there any way you could
really deal with it without

01:11:44.245 --> 01:11:45.270
having grades?

01:11:45.270 --> 01:11:47.243
PROFESSOR: Well, I think
you've identified the

01:11:47.243 --> 01:11:51.750
fundamental problem, which
is the competition.

01:11:51.750 --> 01:11:53.842
So it's sort of like
the water bed.

01:11:53.842 --> 01:11:56.818
If you sit on one side
of the water bed, the

01:11:56.818 --> 01:11:57.816
other side goes up.

01:11:57.816 --> 01:12:00.061
So if you reduce the competition
in one place, it

01:12:00.061 --> 01:12:01.808
might increase in other ways.

01:12:01.808 --> 01:12:03.429
So for example, you have no
grades in high schools, but

01:12:03.429 --> 01:12:06.049
then you have a really, really
high stakes university

01:12:06.049 --> 01:12:07.796
entrance exam, which is not

01:12:07.796 --> 01:12:09.792
necessarily the ideal solution.

01:12:09.792 --> 01:12:13.035
I think the ideal solution
is that you make good

01:12:13.035 --> 01:12:14.810
universities accessible
to all people.

01:12:14.810 --> 01:12:17.942
Or, for example, if you make
it so that you don't need a

01:12:17.942 --> 01:12:19.906
university degree to earn
a decent salary.

01:12:19.906 --> 01:12:25.307
AUDIENCE: But is that ever
going to be possible?

01:12:25.307 --> 01:12:27.290
PROFESSOR: Well, I always quote
Margaret Mead on that,

01:12:27.290 --> 01:12:30.850
"Never underestimate the power
of a small number of people

01:12:30.850 --> 01:12:31.826
[INAUDIBLE]

01:12:31.826 --> 01:12:34.513
to make social change." And not
just a small number, but

01:12:34.513 --> 01:12:35.280
people in general.

01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:39.080
So all things that we now think
are absurd and just

01:12:39.080 --> 01:12:42.170
horrible were once normal.

01:12:42.170 --> 01:12:44.424
Slavery was considered
absolutely normal.

01:12:44.424 --> 01:12:47.826
And in fact, the view of the
inferior races [INAUDIBLE].

01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:55.125
But all these things that we
think are horrible now--

01:12:55.125 --> 01:12:56.762
torture--

01:12:56.762 --> 01:13:00.780
are now considered just beyond
the pale because of social

01:13:00.780 --> 01:13:02.020
[INAUDIBLE].

01:13:02.020 --> 01:13:07.096
So my main point here is that
these are structural,

01:13:07.096 --> 01:13:08.520
fundamental, large issues.

01:13:08.520 --> 01:13:12.920
And they require structural and
large society-wide changes

01:13:12.920 --> 01:13:14.180
to fundamentally change them.

01:13:14.180 --> 01:13:16.938
But it goes both ways.

01:13:16.938 --> 01:13:21.056
The schools themselves produce
people who reinforce the

01:13:21.056 --> 01:13:22.380
social structures.

01:13:22.380 --> 01:13:25.632
So if people had come through
the blue eyes, brown eyes

01:13:25.632 --> 01:13:27.800
experiment and they feel
themselves that they are not

01:13:27.800 --> 01:13:31.590
worthy, they're less likely to
try and make a social change

01:13:31.590 --> 01:13:33.750
to make a just society.

01:13:33.750 --> 01:13:34.980
So it goes both ways.

01:13:34.980 --> 01:13:38.090
Improving the schools and the
educational system improves

01:13:38.090 --> 01:13:38.780
the society.

01:13:38.780 --> 01:13:42.484
Improving the society improves
the schools.

01:13:42.484 --> 01:13:44.360
AUDIENCE: I was wondering if
you could take advantage of

01:13:44.360 --> 01:13:47.282
that blue-eyed, brown-eyed
thing, like to say--

01:13:47.282 --> 01:13:50.490
one could say something like,
oh, people in that class

01:13:50.490 --> 01:13:54.140
always did really well in their
future physics classes.

01:13:54.140 --> 01:13:56.540
And then everyone could just
be like, oh, great.

01:13:56.540 --> 01:13:58.940
[INAUDIBLE].

01:13:58.940 --> 01:13:59.900
PROFESSOR: It's a great point.

01:13:59.900 --> 01:14:01.100
So the point was, could you
take advantage of the blue

01:14:01.100 --> 01:14:03.815
eyes, brown eyes experiment
to just tell people, look,

01:14:03.815 --> 01:14:05.400
everyone in my physics
class does great.

01:14:05.400 --> 01:14:08.760
And so just, actually,
make people do well?

01:14:08.760 --> 01:14:13.560
There is actually a fair amount
of data that does work.

01:14:13.560 --> 01:14:16.820
So [INAUDIBLE] wasn't phrased
in exactly that way, but the

01:14:16.820 --> 01:14:19.330
example I'm thinking of
is women's colleges.

01:14:19.330 --> 01:14:25.070
So a large portion of women in
science Ph.D's come from

01:14:25.070 --> 01:14:26.844
all-women's colleges.

01:14:26.844 --> 01:14:30.950
And I think that's partly
that effect.

01:14:30.950 --> 01:14:33.810
In the regular society, women
are generally told, look,

01:14:33.810 --> 01:14:36.670
[INAUDIBLE] the Barbie doll
that was taken off,

01:14:36.670 --> 01:14:37.590
[INAUDIBLE]

01:14:37.590 --> 01:14:40.919
Barbie doll that for a
while said, oh, math.

01:14:40.919 --> 01:14:41.857
Math is hard.

01:14:41.857 --> 01:14:44.671
I don't do math, or something
like that.

01:14:44.671 --> 01:14:45.480
That's what it taught.

01:14:45.480 --> 01:14:48.938
It's really amazing that they
thought they could do that.

01:14:48.938 --> 01:14:52.149
So there was huge outcry and
they had to take it-- some

01:14:52.149 --> 01:14:52.890
people did spoofs.

01:14:52.890 --> 01:14:57.582
They put that as a Ken doll and
they put a big, deep voice

01:14:57.582 --> 01:15:00.300
in the Barbie doll just
to play on that.

01:15:00.300 --> 01:15:05.486
But that social attitude does
permeate the society.

01:15:05.486 --> 01:15:08.280
And it's much less in the
all-women's colleges.

01:15:08.280 --> 01:15:13.935
So places like Swarthmore, Bryn
Mawr, and Smith where

01:15:13.935 --> 01:15:15.236
women are-- it's
just expected.

01:15:15.236 --> 01:15:16.640
Of course you're going to
do well in science.

01:15:16.640 --> 01:15:18.386
Everyone around here does
well in science.

01:15:18.386 --> 01:15:20.522
It's not considered
anything special.

01:15:20.522 --> 01:15:23.959
It's considered a good thing,
but it's not [INAUDIBLE]

01:15:23.959 --> 01:15:24.941
to women.

01:15:24.941 --> 01:15:27.396
So they already took away the
blue eyes or the brown eyes

01:15:27.396 --> 01:15:28.869
and just put everyone
[INAUDIBLE].

01:15:28.869 --> 01:15:33.288
So I think that is a reason
for not criticizing kids.

01:15:33.288 --> 01:15:35.578
When you're raising young
children or teaching them

01:15:35.578 --> 01:15:36.870
things, don't criticize them.

01:15:36.870 --> 01:15:39.220
And same with grades
at a university.

01:15:39.220 --> 01:15:41.907
Grades should be so the students
can figure out what

01:15:41.907 --> 01:15:45.099
they need to learn more of,
but not as a way of making

01:15:45.099 --> 01:15:46.580
them feel bad.

01:15:46.580 --> 01:15:50.560
That's so hard to do when people
have been graded or

01:15:50.560 --> 01:15:54.366
degraded for so long.

01:15:54.366 --> 01:15:55.338
Question, yeah.

01:15:55.338 --> 01:15:57.282
AUDIENCE: So I wanted to go
back to your earlier point

01:15:57.282 --> 01:15:59.226
about competition, how it takes
it away from one place

01:15:59.226 --> 01:16:00.690
and it ends up another place.

01:16:00.690 --> 01:16:02.246
PROFESSOR: I don't say
it's conserved.

01:16:02.246 --> 01:16:05.204
But you have to think about
the whole system.

01:16:05.204 --> 01:16:07.165
Yeah, so I agree with
the question.

01:16:07.165 --> 01:16:08.097
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:16:08.097 --> 01:16:11.296
Not only it doesn't scale
because of limited resources.

01:16:11.296 --> 01:16:14.600
You can't keep everybody
in teacher one on one.

01:16:14.600 --> 01:16:16.787
It would be great if it
took, but the system

01:16:16.787 --> 01:16:17.892
won't work that way.

01:16:17.892 --> 01:16:18.838
We won't have enough teachers.

01:16:18.838 --> 01:16:23.095
So there's always going to be
competition for resources.

01:16:23.095 --> 01:16:24.410
I just want to--

01:16:24.410 --> 01:16:27.660
PROFESSOR: Well, OK, so the
question of competition.

01:16:27.660 --> 01:16:32.292
So let me close with one quote,
and then I'll come to

01:16:32.292 --> 01:16:32.908
your question.

01:16:32.908 --> 01:16:35.363
OK, so it's a good question.

01:16:35.363 --> 01:16:38.309
So to continue the rest
of what Einstein said.

01:16:38.309 --> 01:16:41.500
So remember, before Einstein
said that one had to cram all

01:16:41.500 --> 01:16:43.235
this stuff into one's mind,
whether one liked it or not.

01:16:43.235 --> 01:16:44.420
"This [INAUDIBLE]

01:16:44.420 --> 01:16:47.650
effect that after I passed the
final exam, I found the

01:16:47.650 --> 01:16:48.770
consideration of any
scientific problems

01:16:48.770 --> 01:16:51.685
distasteful to me for
the entire year.

01:16:51.685 --> 01:16:55.315
It is, in fact, nothing short
of a miracle that the modern

01:16:55.315 --> 01:16:57.800
methods of instruction have
not entirely strangled the

01:16:57.800 --> 01:16:58.131
[? whole new ?]

01:16:58.131 --> 01:16:59.788
curiosity required.

01:16:59.788 --> 01:17:02.950
For this delicate little plant,
aside from stimulation,

01:17:02.950 --> 01:17:04.020
stands mainly in need
of freedom.

01:17:04.020 --> 01:17:06.880
Without this, it goes to wrack
and ruin without fail."

01:17:06.880 --> 01:17:10.693
So I hope that when you're out
in the world, when you're

01:17:10.693 --> 01:17:15.830
teaching and raising your
children, that you find ways

01:17:15.830 --> 01:17:18.468
to make more freedom
in education.

01:17:18.468 --> 01:17:21.384
So that when the students
actually that you produce

01:17:21.384 --> 01:17:23.814
improve the society, and they
then, can help you improve the

01:17:23.814 --> 01:17:29.160
schools and the rest of
the education system.

01:17:29.160 --> 01:17:31.910
OK, your question about
competition.

01:17:31.910 --> 01:17:34.120
It is a fundamental one.

01:17:34.120 --> 01:17:35.410
And about competition for

01:17:35.410 --> 01:17:37.912
resources, you have to really--

01:17:37.912 --> 01:17:39.904
so make a radical analysis.

01:17:39.904 --> 01:17:42.960
So radical in Latin
means to the root.

01:17:42.960 --> 01:17:43.945
So you have to get to the
root of the problem.

01:17:43.945 --> 01:17:45.690
So the root of the problem, you
can see it in the extreme

01:17:45.690 --> 01:17:53.360
case of India where there are
so many people and so few

01:17:53.360 --> 01:17:56.612
comfortable jobs, and the route
to the comfortable job

01:17:56.612 --> 01:17:57.608
is in education.

01:17:57.608 --> 01:17:59.600
That's there's intense
competition for

01:17:59.600 --> 01:18:01.094
tutors and all this.

01:18:01.094 --> 01:18:04.082
Not because people want to
learn, but because that's the

01:18:04.082 --> 01:18:07.070
means to actually not starve
on the street.

01:18:07.070 --> 01:18:11.270
So what that shows is that not
everyone wants to learn with a

01:18:11.270 --> 01:18:13.080
tutor differential equations.

01:18:13.080 --> 01:18:14.918
But a lot of people are
learning differential

01:18:14.918 --> 01:18:17.358
equations with a tutor because
that means they'll get a

01:18:17.358 --> 01:18:20.367
degree, which means they can
work in investment bank, which

01:18:20.367 --> 01:18:21.750
means-- well, it used to
mean that they would be

01:18:21.750 --> 01:18:23.702
comfortable.

01:18:23.702 --> 01:18:26.197
So part of the issue is of
redistributing the wealth in

01:18:26.197 --> 01:18:29.816
the society, so that you're
comfortable whether or not you

01:18:29.816 --> 01:18:31.215
had a tutorial in differential
equations

01:18:31.215 --> 01:18:33.760
or one-on-one tutorial.

01:18:33.760 --> 01:18:38.390
Then, when the fears are taken
away, people are much more

01:18:38.390 --> 01:18:41.330
likely to do things for
intrinsic reasons.

01:18:41.330 --> 01:18:43.073
So the people who really
are interested in

01:18:43.073 --> 01:18:43.820
that, then do that.

01:18:43.820 --> 01:18:45.314
The people who are really
interested in teaching that

01:18:45.314 --> 01:18:47.306
will teach that.

01:18:47.306 --> 01:18:51.041
And you'll have a redirection
of social resources in much

01:18:51.041 --> 01:18:52.784
more productive way.

01:18:52.784 --> 01:18:54.776
But that requires, for example,
the value of, say,

01:18:54.776 --> 01:18:55.970
guaranteed income, guaranteed
health care.

01:18:55.970 --> 01:18:59.869
Maybe even guaranteed basic
schooling for everyone, so

01:18:59.869 --> 01:19:03.074
that those things are features
of competition.

01:19:03.074 --> 01:19:03.567
Yeah.

01:19:03.567 --> 01:19:06.032
AUDIENCE: But the system based
on competition is quite

01:19:06.032 --> 01:19:09.483
self-regulating, right?

01:19:09.483 --> 01:19:10.490
PROFESSOR: I don't
know about that.

01:19:10.490 --> 01:19:12.090
So a good example-- is the
system based on competition

01:19:12.090 --> 01:19:12.880
self-regulating?

01:19:12.880 --> 01:19:14.190
I'm not sure about that.

01:19:14.190 --> 01:19:16.966
I mean, the mortgage derivative
market is a great

01:19:16.966 --> 01:19:20.223
example that-- actually, what
happened was-- you can think

01:19:20.223 --> 01:19:22.410
of it in electrical
engineering terms.

01:19:25.290 --> 01:19:26.540
You had--

01:19:29.130 --> 01:19:31.430
let's do it under
continuous time.

01:19:34.846 --> 01:19:38.262
So you had some sort of slow,
pokey banking system with

01:19:38.262 --> 01:19:42.166
feedback loops and the poles
were [INAUDIBLE].

01:19:45.100 --> 01:19:47.100
[INAUDIBLE], nice
decay constant.

01:19:47.100 --> 01:19:50.870
And then, the competition to
make more money quickly--

01:19:50.870 --> 01:19:53.987
well, one way to make more
money was to trade

01:19:53.987 --> 01:19:55.424
[INAUDIBLE].

01:19:55.424 --> 01:19:56.382
What did that do?

01:19:56.382 --> 01:19:59.735
It increased the gaming of
feedback loops and [INAUDIBLE]

01:19:59.735 --> 01:20:01.172
the poles this way.

01:20:01.172 --> 01:20:02.780
And eventually, some of the
poles crossed the axis and you

01:20:02.780 --> 01:20:06.932
got huge nonlinear oscillations,
which grew to--

01:20:06.932 --> 01:20:10.313
huge oscillations grew to
nonlinear [INAUDIBLE] and

01:20:10.313 --> 01:20:12.728
broke a whole bunch of the
world banking system.

01:20:12.728 --> 01:20:14.670
So it's actually not necessarily
true that

01:20:14.670 --> 01:20:17.460
competition is self-regulating,
because there

01:20:17.460 --> 01:20:20.057
are all these nonlinearities
and feedbacks and delays in

01:20:20.057 --> 01:20:23.640
the system, there's no
guarantee of that.

01:20:23.640 --> 01:20:27.000
And one of the harms of the
competition is it puts people

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:28.440
against each other.

01:20:28.440 --> 01:20:31.606
And what'd you much rather
have is people working

01:20:31.606 --> 01:20:34.498
together and helping
each other.

01:20:34.498 --> 01:20:38.354
Because as studies quoted by
[INAUDIBLE] showed, that

01:20:38.354 --> 01:20:40.764
actually-- if you want it to go
a high level, [INAUDIBLE].

01:20:40.764 --> 01:20:41.728
That's how it happens.

01:20:41.728 --> 01:20:45.319
Not through competition and
dog-eat-dog, but people

01:20:45.319 --> 01:20:47.814
cooperating and sharing
knowledge.

01:20:47.814 --> 01:20:50.808
And what we wanted to do, I
would say in our educational

01:20:50.808 --> 01:20:54.800
system, is shift it more towards
there and free people

01:20:54.800 --> 01:20:56.580
[INAUDIBLE] for creating
the [INAUDIBLE].

01:20:56.580 --> 01:20:57.830
Instead of [INAUDIBLE].

01:21:00.939 --> 01:21:03.617
AUDIENCE: So we don't determine
the pay of different

01:21:03.617 --> 01:21:05.322
people in the society
based on the

01:21:05.322 --> 01:21:06.783
competition, what do you propose?

01:21:06.783 --> 01:21:09.705
Do you propose that somebody
else decides [INAUDIBLE]?

01:21:12.650 --> 01:21:14.800
PROFESSOR: Well, we already
have all kinds of ways.

01:21:14.800 --> 01:21:16.622
I mean, you can have
regulations.

01:21:16.622 --> 01:21:17.382
You could, for example.

01:21:17.382 --> 01:21:20.150
Say, I mean, income tax is a
social way of deciding what's

01:21:20.150 --> 01:21:21.426
worthwhile and what's not.

01:21:21.426 --> 01:21:27.138
You could say, OK, we're going
to tax peoples' income the

01:21:27.138 --> 01:21:28.629
99%, beyond 200,000.

01:21:28.629 --> 01:21:29.623
[INAUDIBLE].

01:21:29.623 --> 01:21:33.020
And we're going to use that
money to pay teachers more.

01:21:33.020 --> 01:21:36.210
That's a social choice because
saying the teachers'

01:21:36.210 --> 01:21:37.755
salaries are this.

01:21:37.755 --> 01:21:40.896
If you think it's a worthwhile
thing to do we could say look,

01:21:40.896 --> 01:21:43.356
we think bridge building
is really important it

01:21:43.356 --> 01:21:44.832
revitalizes the [INAUDIBLE].

01:21:44.832 --> 01:21:46.659
We're going to pay people
to do that.

01:21:46.659 --> 01:21:49.260
Those are social choices,
just like anything.

01:21:49.260 --> 01:21:51.228
It doesn't have to
be permissive.

01:21:51.228 --> 01:21:52.212
All right?

01:21:52.212 --> 01:21:53.688
So we can change our educational
system that way.

01:21:53.688 --> 01:21:59.108
The barrier to it is that our
thoughts are limited by the

01:21:59.108 --> 01:22:00.170
educational system that
we went through.

01:22:00.170 --> 01:22:04.440
So in one way that's bad news,
because there was this giant

01:22:04.440 --> 01:22:06.650
feedback loop keeping things
the way they are.

01:22:06.650 --> 01:22:10.922
On the other hand, because
there's a feedback loop, the

01:22:10.922 --> 01:22:14.725
educational system affects the
society and vice versa.

01:22:14.725 --> 01:22:17.136
Well, it means you can work
anywhere on the feedback loop

01:22:17.136 --> 01:22:19.040
you want that you think
is interesting.

01:22:19.040 --> 01:22:20.944
You could try to improve
the society directly.

01:22:20.944 --> 01:22:22.850
You could try to improve the
educational system in

01:22:22.850 --> 01:22:24.236
[INAUDIBLE].

01:22:24.236 --> 01:22:27.105
You can try to skip the feedback
wherever you see it.

01:22:27.105 --> 01:22:28.543
Insert something good in here.

01:22:28.543 --> 01:22:34.459
And you improve things for
everybody that way.

01:22:34.459 --> 01:22:38.403
OK, so if you could fill
out the question sheet.

01:22:38.403 --> 01:22:41.361
[INAUDIBLE]

01:22:41.361 --> 01:22:43.333
put on the website
who [INAUDIBLE]

01:22:46.291 --> 01:22:49.742
as well as referenced
[INAUDIBLE].

01:22:49.742 --> 01:22:55.104
And next time we'll have a
summary of all of the second

01:22:55.104 --> 01:22:56.354
[INAUDIBLE]

01:23:03.056 --> 01:23:06.535
as well as questions from you.

01:23:06.535 --> 01:23:09.943
Because I know I have a few
questions that I have to

01:23:09.943 --> 01:23:13.493
answer plus [INAUDIBLE].

01:23:13.493 --> 01:23:15.978
So we'll try to answer all your
questions [INAUDIBLE].

01:23:21.600 --> 01:23:23.880
Answers from lecture
10 to questions

01:23:23.880 --> 01:23:25.400
generated in lecture 9.

01:23:28.352 --> 01:23:32.510
PROFESSOR: OK, lots of questions
from last time.

01:23:32.510 --> 01:23:35.620
So I won't answer all of them
because otherwise we'll

01:23:35.620 --> 01:23:37.600
probably spend the entire
time just on the

01:23:37.600 --> 01:23:39.620
questions from last time.

01:23:39.620 --> 01:23:43.980
Which maybe I should have
anticipated since it's a

01:23:43.980 --> 01:23:48.800
central topic and one that
connects to not just

01:23:48.800 --> 01:23:51.860
education, but directly to
society, the topic on

01:23:51.860 --> 01:23:53.550
political barriers to
educational change.

01:23:53.550 --> 01:23:55.040
So I'll answer some of those.

01:23:55.040 --> 01:23:59.060
But then I wanted to also give
you a chance to ask any

01:23:59.060 --> 01:24:01.670
questions that have been
unresolved that have come up

01:24:01.670 --> 01:24:05.040
in your teaching or that
you think might

01:24:05.040 --> 01:24:06.490
come up in your teaching.

01:24:06.490 --> 01:24:09.820
One of my old teachers, Don
[? Knuth, ?] always reserved

01:24:09.820 --> 01:24:12.520
the last session for
student questions.

01:24:12.520 --> 01:24:16.080
And I think it's a really good
philosophy to tie everything

01:24:16.080 --> 01:24:18.170
together, tie all the
loose ends up.

01:24:18.170 --> 01:24:21.590
So I call it your turn.

01:24:21.590 --> 01:24:24.680
OK, but part of your turn was
answering some of your

01:24:24.680 --> 01:24:27.720
questions from before.

01:24:27.720 --> 01:24:31.680
Is social education
a bad thing?

01:24:31.680 --> 01:24:33.880
And so the comment was, I'm
still not convinced social

01:24:33.880 --> 01:24:35.130
education is a bad thing.

01:24:37.700 --> 01:24:40.010
Obviously it gives a lot of
control to whoever gets to

01:24:40.010 --> 01:24:43.160
make the decision of what
constitutes a good citizen.

01:24:43.160 --> 01:24:46.620
But some of the social agendas
in public schooling were good.

01:24:46.620 --> 01:24:49.470
For example, diversity,
recycling.

01:24:49.470 --> 01:24:50.780
And that's true.

01:24:50.780 --> 01:24:54.660
So I don't want to be
misinterpreted as saying

01:24:54.660 --> 01:24:56.200
society is a bad thing.

01:24:56.200 --> 01:24:59.480
I think society naturally
educates people.

01:24:59.480 --> 01:25:02.230
You pick up your values from
people around you.

01:25:02.230 --> 01:25:05.810
Your parents give you
ethical norms.

01:25:05.810 --> 01:25:07.440
Schools give you
ethical norms.

01:25:07.440 --> 01:25:10.400
And I think it's exactly what
the question said, it said who

01:25:10.400 --> 01:25:11.690
gets to decide?

01:25:11.690 --> 01:25:16.780
Is it some group of elites who
decide or is it the whole

01:25:16.780 --> 01:25:21.190
society collectively deciding
what is good for everybody.

01:25:21.190 --> 01:25:24.100
And what's good for everybody
may not be one thing.

01:25:24.100 --> 01:25:27.240
It may be the decision is well,
different people need or

01:25:27.240 --> 01:25:28.210
want different things.

01:25:28.210 --> 01:25:31.270
And we think a good society is
based on the idea that people

01:25:31.270 --> 01:25:33.710
have freedom to follow
their interests.

01:25:33.710 --> 01:25:38.480
And also, some required work
that everyone need to learn,

01:25:38.480 --> 01:25:39.940
for example, reading.

01:25:39.940 --> 01:25:42.090
But then what you read
may be up to you.

01:25:42.090 --> 01:25:45.160
So yeah, I don't think all
social education is a bad

01:25:45.160 --> 01:25:45.590
thing at all.

01:25:45.590 --> 01:25:47.230
I think all education
is social.

01:25:47.230 --> 01:25:49.140
There's no way to avoid that.

01:25:49.140 --> 01:25:51.770
Inherently we're
social animals.

01:25:51.770 --> 01:25:55.180
And it's the question of what's
in that education?

01:25:55.180 --> 01:25:57.220
And it's the same
thing, political

01:25:57.220 --> 01:25:59.070
barriers educational change.

01:25:59.070 --> 01:26:01.700
It's not that politics is
inherently a bad thing.

01:26:01.700 --> 01:26:04.530
The question is, what kind
of politics do we have?

01:26:04.530 --> 01:26:08.390
And how can we make that
better and more humane?

01:26:08.390 --> 01:26:12.200
So for example, I think
recycling is a good example of

01:26:12.200 --> 01:26:15.360
making things more humane.

01:26:15.360 --> 01:26:18.490
OK, if competition demotivates
some people does it motivate

01:26:18.490 --> 01:26:19.610
other people?

01:26:19.610 --> 01:26:23.990
Does eliminating competition
reduce maximum performance?

01:26:23.990 --> 01:26:26.900
Other than the studies referred
to by Alfie Kohn, I'm

01:26:26.900 --> 01:26:29.660
not sure if the answer
to that is known.

01:26:29.660 --> 01:26:34.610
I mean, there's certainly
studies on how, for example,

01:26:34.610 --> 01:26:37.260
competition leads to
a lot of waste.

01:26:37.260 --> 01:26:41.070
The classic example in economics
is suppose you--

01:26:41.070 --> 01:26:44.040
and this was actually
a real example--

01:26:44.040 --> 01:26:48.240
give people 160 acres
of land--

01:26:48.240 --> 01:26:52.210
I think that was the a 1/4
plot-- or 640 acres of land

01:26:52.210 --> 01:26:53.660
way out in the west.

01:26:53.660 --> 01:26:58.140
And the rule is whoever gets
there first gets to claim that

01:26:58.140 --> 01:26:59.680
piece of land.

01:26:59.680 --> 01:27:03.610
And you get there and you stick
posts up and you put a

01:27:03.610 --> 01:27:04.070
fence there.

01:27:04.070 --> 01:27:06.270
That's roughly how the
Homestead Act worked.

01:27:06.270 --> 01:27:08.460
Well, the problem with
that is that it does

01:27:08.460 --> 01:27:09.480
cause a lot of waste.

01:27:09.480 --> 01:27:14.080
Which is that tons of people
might run out and

01:27:14.080 --> 01:27:15.490
chase after that land.

01:27:15.490 --> 01:27:18.500
And make a whole bunch of effort
buying train tickets,

01:27:18.500 --> 01:27:20.970
go on a wagon with their
whole family out west.

01:27:20.970 --> 01:27:22.750
But only one person
gets the land.

01:27:22.750 --> 01:27:24.710
So a whole bunch of people
actually put in a lot of

01:27:24.710 --> 01:27:25.780
wasted effort.

01:27:25.780 --> 01:27:28.970
So that's a classic example
of how competition

01:27:28.970 --> 01:27:30.530
can be quite wasteful.

01:27:30.530 --> 01:27:32.280
Other examples, where exclusive

01:27:32.280 --> 01:27:34.110
rights do that, or patents.

01:27:34.110 --> 01:27:38.850
So as is the case, a patent's
only given to one person--

01:27:38.850 --> 01:27:41.000
or the inventor--

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.420
and you have 15 people
or 30 people

01:27:43.420 --> 01:27:44.610
trying to invent something.

01:27:44.610 --> 01:27:47.450
So the more the competition, in
this case, the more waste

01:27:47.450 --> 01:27:48.230
is going to happen.

01:27:48.230 --> 01:27:50.560
Because all these people are
going to invest funds.

01:27:50.560 --> 01:27:53.420
But only one person is going
to get the exclusive right.

01:27:53.420 --> 01:27:56.970
And the other people are
just left high and dry.

01:27:56.970 --> 01:28:01.850
So there's many examples where
eliminating competition will

01:28:01.850 --> 01:28:06.540
actually increase the amount of
social wealth contributed

01:28:06.540 --> 01:28:07.910
towards useful ends.

01:28:07.910 --> 01:28:11.090
But to the direct question of
whether it reduces maximum

01:28:11.090 --> 01:28:14.120
forms, I don't know
if that's known.

01:28:14.120 --> 01:28:18.670
The studies in Alfie Kohn's
article pointed to how

01:28:18.670 --> 01:28:22.120
competition reduces high-level
performance.

01:28:22.120 --> 01:28:25.320
For example, complex
cognitive tasks.

01:28:25.320 --> 01:28:28.480
Maximum performance, probably,
one would need to define that

01:28:28.480 --> 01:28:29.150
pretty closely.

01:28:29.150 --> 01:28:32.735
And then one could
do studies on it.

01:28:32.735 --> 01:28:37.000
OK, so there was an interesting
question about the

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:38.470
understanding multiplication.

01:28:38.470 --> 01:28:40.850
So the understanding
multiplication example I gave,

01:28:40.850 --> 01:28:44.650
where people could multiply
6 by 3 and get 18 but then

01:28:44.650 --> 01:28:48.590
couldn't come up with a word
problem that used 6 by 3.

01:28:48.590 --> 01:28:51.620
Or they could, but the word
problem was Johnny buys 6

01:28:51.620 --> 01:28:52.950
apples on Monday.

01:28:52.950 --> 01:28:54.530
He buys 3 apples on Tuesday.

01:28:54.530 --> 01:28:56.810
So 6 times 3 is 18.

01:28:56.810 --> 01:29:00.680
So that was, maybe, a bit
unfair to ask students.

01:29:00.680 --> 01:29:05.900
Because writing a story draws on
skills beyond mathematical

01:29:05.900 --> 01:29:09.260
understanding such as
imagination and language.

01:29:09.260 --> 01:29:12.260
So it's true, it does draw
on those skills.

01:29:12.260 --> 01:29:14.360
But I don't think those are
separate from mathematical

01:29:14.360 --> 01:29:14.940
understanding.

01:29:14.940 --> 01:29:19.210
If you can't explain the
mathematics that you in you,

01:29:19.210 --> 01:29:21.540
you don't really
understand it.

01:29:21.540 --> 01:29:25.360
When I was an undergraduate a
friend of mine and I used to

01:29:25.360 --> 01:29:27.070
torment the math
grad students.

01:29:27.070 --> 01:29:28.400
It was sort of unfair.

01:29:28.400 --> 01:29:29.990
And we were really curious
about math.

01:29:29.990 --> 01:29:31.300
We were fascinated by math.

01:29:31.300 --> 01:29:33.660
And we wanted to know what
people do in graduate school.

01:29:33.660 --> 01:29:35.390
And only later did
I realize we were

01:29:35.390 --> 01:29:36.230
actually tormenting them.

01:29:36.230 --> 01:29:37.240
We weren't doing it
intentionally.

01:29:37.240 --> 01:29:40.030
We would ask them, OK, what
are you working on?

01:29:40.030 --> 01:29:42.090
Sometimes we had classes with
them or we'd see them in the

01:29:42.090 --> 01:29:42.970
math lounge.

01:29:42.970 --> 01:29:46.920
And they would say, oh, blah,
blah, the theorem.

01:29:46.920 --> 01:29:49.130
And we were undergraduates
and young.

01:29:49.130 --> 01:29:50.480
And we didn't really know
what the theorem was.

01:29:50.480 --> 01:29:53.650
So we'd say, well, can you
give us an example?

01:29:53.650 --> 01:29:56.780
And that produced just deer
in the headlights.

01:29:56.780 --> 01:29:58.230
Example?

01:29:58.230 --> 01:29:59.430
Example?

01:29:59.430 --> 01:30:02.390
That was completely foreign and
not at all what they were

01:30:02.390 --> 01:30:02.930
thinking about.

01:30:02.930 --> 01:30:04.800
It was completely out
of their space.

01:30:04.800 --> 01:30:08.750
And later I actually realized
that that was actually a very

01:30:08.750 --> 01:30:09.840
fair question.

01:30:09.840 --> 01:30:12.350
And if you wanted to test
whether people understood what

01:30:12.350 --> 01:30:13.680
they were working on.

01:30:13.680 --> 01:30:16.530
And I found that things I can
give examples on I understand.

01:30:16.530 --> 01:30:19.060
The things I can't, I
don't understand.

01:30:19.060 --> 01:30:21.510
Another example that
is Feynman.

01:30:21.510 --> 01:30:25.120
He said, I have always found
that I don't understand

01:30:25.120 --> 01:30:28.630
anything unless I can give
a freshman lecture on it.

01:30:28.630 --> 01:30:31.470
Or equivalently, people
asked him to give

01:30:31.470 --> 01:30:32.260
a lecture on something.

01:30:32.260 --> 01:30:34.580
He said, no, I don't
understand.

01:30:34.580 --> 01:30:36.030
I don't understand
that well enough.

01:30:36.030 --> 01:30:37.920
I'll have to first work out
a freshman lecture on it.

01:30:37.920 --> 01:30:39.390
Then I can explain it better.

01:30:39.390 --> 01:30:43.080
And so there's famous lectures
of his where he's explained

01:30:43.080 --> 01:30:45.340
anti particles and spin.

01:30:45.340 --> 01:30:47.850
And he finally got it to a level
where he thinks it was

01:30:47.850 --> 01:30:50.260
actually suitable for a
freshman, so first-year

01:30:50.260 --> 01:30:51.050
college students.

01:30:51.050 --> 01:30:52.720
So it's a brilliant lecture.

01:30:52.720 --> 01:30:56.130
If you search for the Dirac
Memorial Lectures by Feynman

01:30:56.130 --> 01:30:57.180
you'll find that
lecture there.

01:30:57.180 --> 01:30:58.230
And it's fascinating.

01:30:58.230 --> 01:31:01.660
So it shows the level of how
hard work it is to actually

01:31:01.660 --> 01:31:02.840
understand something
of that level.

01:31:02.840 --> 01:31:07.090
And almost essential to that
process is examples.

01:31:07.090 --> 01:31:09.510
So examples, explaining,
understanding, I think those

01:31:09.510 --> 01:31:11.280
are intrinsic to mathematical
understanding.

01:31:11.280 --> 01:31:13.520
So it wasn't an unfair test.

01:31:13.520 --> 01:31:16.010
It was actually a test of
high-level mathematical

01:31:16.010 --> 01:31:17.260
understanding.

01:31:19.060 --> 01:31:21.450
One point was made, Swarthmore
was not a women's college.

01:31:21.450 --> 01:31:22.010
Yeah, that's true.

01:31:22.010 --> 01:31:27.980
I mentioned that women's
colleges were much more

01:31:27.980 --> 01:31:31.560
successful in producing women
Ph.D. students in science.

01:31:31.560 --> 01:31:33.970
And I listed Bryn
Mawr and Smith.

01:31:33.970 --> 01:31:36.060
And then I listed Swarthmore,
which was not correct.

01:31:36.060 --> 01:31:38.890
That was crosstalk between Bryn
Mawr is and Swarthmore.

01:31:38.890 --> 01:31:40.630
I grouped them all, Bryn
Mawr, Haverford,

01:31:40.630 --> 01:31:41.850
and Swarthmore together.

01:31:41.850 --> 01:31:44.510
So Swarthmore is a coeducational
college.

01:31:44.510 --> 01:31:47.900
And I meant Bryn
Mawr and Smith.

01:31:47.900 --> 01:31:50.490
And I was thinking of
Wellesley as well.

01:31:50.490 --> 01:31:53.050
So Wellesley is an all-women's
college, unless they've

01:31:53.050 --> 01:31:53.940
changed lately?

01:31:53.940 --> 01:31:54.770
No, OK.

01:31:54.770 --> 01:31:58.800
I mean every once in a while
colleges think of changing.

01:31:58.800 --> 01:32:01.590
But they're still all women.

01:32:01.590 --> 01:32:03.490
Now, people asked for references
and further

01:32:03.490 --> 01:32:04.910
information about that.

01:32:04.910 --> 01:32:09.360
So I'll put a link
on the website.

01:32:09.360 --> 01:32:13.370
But it's Barbara Whitten at the
Colorado College physics

01:32:13.370 --> 01:32:16.450
department, she's done the most
extensive studies on not

01:32:16.450 --> 01:32:22.810
just what makes for women being
successful in science,

01:32:22.810 --> 01:32:25.110
but in general, what makes
for students in

01:32:25.110 --> 01:32:25.910
say, physics majors.

01:32:25.910 --> 01:32:30.000
She was the chair of the
Colorado College physics

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:31.940
department when I interviewed
there.

01:32:31.940 --> 01:32:35.230
What makes for a successful
undergraduate major program?

01:32:35.230 --> 01:32:38.070
So this is quite interesting
for people

01:32:38.070 --> 01:32:38.860
interested in teaching.

01:32:38.860 --> 01:32:41.550
Not just revising one course,
but revising an entire

01:32:41.550 --> 01:32:43.040
department curriculum.

01:32:43.040 --> 01:32:46.290
So she's done
cross-institutional studies of

01:32:46.290 --> 01:32:50.630
the culture of departments and
what facets of the culture are

01:32:50.630 --> 01:32:53.810
responsible for students
continuing on in science.

01:32:53.810 --> 01:32:58.810
And what she's found is that
the same features that help

01:32:58.810 --> 01:33:01.760
women continue in science
help everybody.

01:33:01.760 --> 01:33:04.960
So I highly recommend
her work.

01:33:04.960 --> 01:33:09.710
And I'll put a link to her web
page on our course web page.

01:33:09.710 --> 01:33:11.120
Barbara Whitten.

01:33:11.120 --> 01:33:17.080
I think it's W-I-T-T-E-N. But it
might be W-H-I-T-T-E-N, the

01:33:17.080 --> 01:33:18.670
Colorado College physics
department.

01:33:23.230 --> 01:33:31.670
OK, it's clear that I don't
like No Child Left Behind.

01:33:31.670 --> 01:33:33.310
But would I do if I were
the Secretary of

01:33:33.310 --> 01:33:34.885
Education in this country?

01:33:34.885 --> 01:33:36.920
Yeah, well, Hell would probably
freeze over before

01:33:36.920 --> 01:33:39.830
that happened.

01:33:39.830 --> 01:33:43.580
There's a long vetting process
before people become that.

01:33:43.580 --> 01:33:46.290
And you have to show your
loyalty to pretty much every

01:33:46.290 --> 01:33:49.920
aspect of the current system
before that happens, before

01:33:49.920 --> 01:33:51.590
you're appointed
to such a post.

01:33:51.590 --> 01:33:55.960
But if Hell froze over
what would I do?

01:33:55.960 --> 01:34:00.670
I think one of the fundamental
problems with education in

01:34:00.670 --> 01:34:03.390
America is the vast
inequalities

01:34:03.390 --> 01:34:06.590
in funding, in resources.

01:34:06.590 --> 01:34:09.560
So the wealthy school districts
have two, three,

01:34:09.560 --> 01:34:12.310
four times as much funds
per student as

01:34:12.310 --> 01:34:13.560
the poor school districts.

01:34:16.640 --> 01:34:18.840
And there's a good
part of that.

01:34:18.840 --> 01:34:20.540
I mean, the disparity is bad.

01:34:20.540 --> 01:34:23.250
But there's a reason
for the disparity.

01:34:23.250 --> 01:34:24.420
And the reason isn't all bad.

01:34:24.420 --> 01:34:29.740
The reason is that America
education is a local affair.

01:34:29.740 --> 01:34:31.860
It's controlled by local
authorities.

01:34:31.860 --> 01:34:36.570
So the constitution reserves
a bunch of powers for the

01:34:36.570 --> 01:34:40.030
federal government, printing
money, making war, various

01:34:40.030 --> 01:34:41.550
things like that.

01:34:41.550 --> 01:34:46.650
Then it says, OK, then the
states can do a bunch of stuff

01:34:46.650 --> 01:34:49.150
like, for example,
regulate voting.

01:34:49.150 --> 01:34:53.410
And then it says anything not
explicitly given to the

01:34:53.410 --> 01:34:56.870
national or state governments
is given to the people.

01:34:56.870 --> 01:35:04.300
Or in fact I think it says--
this is the 10th or 11th

01:35:04.300 --> 01:35:05.270
commandment--

01:35:05.270 --> 01:35:06.210
especially devolution.

01:35:06.210 --> 01:35:08.420
It says any powers not given to
the federal government go

01:35:08.420 --> 01:35:09.220
to the state.

01:35:09.220 --> 01:35:10.210
If they're given to the state.

01:35:10.210 --> 01:35:13.810
And if not given to the state
they go to the people.

01:35:13.810 --> 01:35:16.500
And so education is
in that category.

01:35:16.500 --> 01:35:19.390
It's nowhere mentioned in the
constitution, education.

01:35:19.390 --> 01:35:21.390
So it's not given
to the states.

01:35:21.390 --> 01:35:22.660
It's not given to the
federal government.

01:35:22.660 --> 01:35:25.710
So in America it's given to
the local authorities.

01:35:25.710 --> 01:35:27.980
Now the problem is that
different communities have

01:35:27.980 --> 01:35:29.410
different wealth bases.

01:35:29.410 --> 01:35:31.010
Because there's some
very rich suburbs.

01:35:31.010 --> 01:35:33.280
And for a while the cities
were wealthy.

01:35:33.280 --> 01:35:34.400
But then people fled.

01:35:34.400 --> 01:35:37.560
All the wealthy people fled the
cities in the 1950s during

01:35:37.560 --> 01:35:37.960
suburbanization.

01:35:37.960 --> 01:35:41.360
So the centers of cities
became very poor.

01:35:41.360 --> 01:35:44.270
So there's vast disparities
in wealth there.

01:35:44.270 --> 01:35:47.160
And I think one thing that the
federal government could do is

01:35:47.160 --> 01:35:48.900
actually just correct those.

01:35:48.900 --> 01:35:53.220
So there've been lawsuits along
those lines for forcing

01:35:53.220 --> 01:35:56.660
state governments to try to
correct that because there is

01:35:56.660 --> 01:35:59.390
some role for the states
in education.

01:35:59.390 --> 01:36:01.610
I'm not sure where that comes
from in the constitution.

01:36:01.610 --> 01:36:04.180
But there are state boards
of education.

01:36:04.180 --> 01:36:06.790
And I think it's Vermont and
New Jersey, there've been

01:36:06.790 --> 01:36:10.210
lawsuits in state courts to
force the states to equalize

01:36:10.210 --> 01:36:12.430
funding across school
districts.

01:36:12.430 --> 01:36:14.510
So somehow mitigating
the differential in

01:36:14.510 --> 01:36:16.170
property-tax revenues.

01:36:16.170 --> 01:36:17.460
And I think the federal
government

01:36:17.460 --> 01:36:18.580
could do that as well.

01:36:18.580 --> 01:36:20.430
So those lawsuits
are based on--

01:36:20.430 --> 01:36:23.910
I'm pretty sure-- the 14th
Amendment, equal

01:36:23.910 --> 01:36:25.560
protection of the laws.

01:36:25.560 --> 01:36:28.020
Now, there's no reason the
federal government couldn't do

01:36:28.020 --> 01:36:28.570
that as well.

01:36:28.570 --> 01:36:30.400
So I would do that as
step number one.

01:36:30.400 --> 01:36:32.650
No strings attached,
here, let's just

01:36:32.650 --> 01:36:33.950
equalize the resources.

01:36:33.950 --> 01:36:36.150
And then we can worry
about what we're

01:36:36.150 --> 01:36:37.190
going to do after that.

01:36:37.190 --> 01:36:40.880
Whereas No Child Left Behind,
what it does, it makes the

01:36:40.880 --> 01:36:42.800
resources actually,
more unequal.

01:36:42.800 --> 01:36:45.300
Because it tests all
the schools.

01:36:45.300 --> 01:36:48.040
And the schools that are going
to do badly are the ones with

01:36:48.040 --> 01:36:48.880
less resources.

01:36:48.880 --> 01:36:52.330
And then they're going to get
punished for doing badly.

01:36:52.330 --> 01:36:54.930
So I would take the
opposite approach.

01:36:54.930 --> 01:36:56.940
Is there a particular country's
educational system

01:36:56.940 --> 01:36:58.320
that I particularly admire?

01:36:58.320 --> 01:37:01.130
That's a good question.

01:37:01.130 --> 01:37:02.670
Again, I think it's local.

01:37:02.670 --> 01:37:05.480
There's local educational
experiments that I admire a

01:37:05.480 --> 01:37:07.840
lot and occasionally
larger-scale ones.

01:37:07.840 --> 01:37:10.430
A whole country, not so much.

01:37:10.430 --> 01:37:12.350
I mean, there's states
in India, for

01:37:12.350 --> 01:37:14.250
example, for awhile Kerala--

01:37:14.250 --> 01:37:16.620
I don't know if this is still
true-- but had an incredibly

01:37:16.620 --> 01:37:21.430
high literacy rate, I think
98%, Which was much higher

01:37:21.430 --> 01:37:23.330
than anywhere else in India
and matches literacy

01:37:23.330 --> 01:37:25.480
levels in the West.

01:37:25.480 --> 01:37:27.370
And this has many benefits.

01:37:27.370 --> 01:37:31.460
So for example, one study
about population is that

01:37:31.460 --> 01:37:34.390
population growth is slowed
down the most

01:37:34.390 --> 01:37:36.500
by educating women.

01:37:36.500 --> 01:37:41.160
And Kerala actually, that 98%
included women not just men.

01:37:41.160 --> 01:37:43.940
So I think that's an educational
system worth

01:37:43.940 --> 01:37:44.930
looking into.

01:37:44.930 --> 01:37:48.980
And places that I admire,
there are local pockets.

01:37:48.980 --> 01:37:51.140
The free schools in the 1960s.

01:37:51.140 --> 01:37:55.250
There's a few places like
that still in America.

01:37:55.250 --> 01:37:57.920
There's the Sudbury
Valley School.

01:37:57.920 --> 01:37:59.990
Maybe it's 50 miles
west of here.

01:37:59.990 --> 01:38:02.600
It's in the Sudbury Valley.

01:38:02.600 --> 01:38:05.560
And that's modeled on
Summerhill, one of the

01:38:05.560 --> 01:38:08.160
earliest free schools
in England.

01:38:08.160 --> 01:38:10.980
So actually, it has
its good and bad.

01:38:10.980 --> 01:38:13.550
So Summerhill, there's
no required classes.

01:38:13.550 --> 01:38:15.650
And there's no required
curriculum.

01:38:15.650 --> 01:38:18.430
And the students can
go to class or not

01:38:18.430 --> 01:38:20.550
and can play outside.

01:38:20.550 --> 01:38:22.550
So that would work
really well.

01:38:22.550 --> 01:38:23.970
I think that works really
well if all the

01:38:23.970 --> 01:38:27.080
teachers are really inspiring.

01:38:27.080 --> 01:38:28.650
Because then the students would
be automatically drawn

01:38:28.650 --> 01:38:30.550
in to learn stuff.

01:38:30.550 --> 01:38:32.550
But if the teachers aren't very
skilled then you have

01:38:32.550 --> 01:38:33.630
problems with that.

01:38:33.630 --> 01:38:35.270
So I think it worked
mixed there.

01:38:35.270 --> 01:38:40.690
But the potential is good and
the freedom is really good.

01:38:40.690 --> 01:38:42.040
And it teaches people
to be responsible.

01:38:42.040 --> 01:38:44.395
But it has its downsides.

01:38:44.395 --> 01:38:46.020
So I have a personal experience
with that.

01:38:46.020 --> 01:38:48.090
Which is when I was three.

01:38:48.090 --> 01:38:49.200
So I was born in England.

01:38:49.200 --> 01:38:50.850
And we lived there
for a few years.

01:38:50.850 --> 01:38:52.590
And then we moved
to New Jersey.

01:38:52.590 --> 01:38:57.550
And I guess I was four maybe,
my parents thought about

01:38:57.550 --> 01:39:00.110
sending me to England
to go to Summerhill

01:39:00.110 --> 01:39:02.290
because this was 1973.

01:39:02.290 --> 01:39:04.360
So it was in the middle
of lots of

01:39:04.360 --> 01:39:05.610
political change in America.

01:39:05.610 --> 01:39:08.720
Free schools were a big part
of the cultural discussion.

01:39:08.720 --> 01:39:11.070
And my parents believed
in those values, which

01:39:11.070 --> 01:39:11.880
I'm glad they did.

01:39:11.880 --> 01:39:14.580
And they thought, OK, let's see
about sending Sanjay to

01:39:14.580 --> 01:39:15.260
Summerhill.

01:39:15.260 --> 01:39:18.030
So we took a trip
back to England.

01:39:18.030 --> 01:39:19.170
And they visited.

01:39:19.170 --> 01:39:22.300
And the way they tell me what
happened, was that everything

01:39:22.300 --> 01:39:26.890
was fine except then they were
wandering around with the

01:39:26.890 --> 01:39:28.290
teacher on the tour.

01:39:28.290 --> 01:39:30.940
And they saw these marks
on the door.

01:39:30.940 --> 01:39:33.470
And they said, what are those
marks on the door?

01:39:33.470 --> 01:39:35.460
Because they believed in the
philosophy of letting children

01:39:35.460 --> 01:39:37.550
do what they want to do and
follow their interests.

01:39:37.550 --> 01:39:39.755
But they said, oh, what are
those marks on the door there?

01:39:39.755 --> 01:39:41.960
And they said, oh,
that's Johnny.

01:39:41.960 --> 01:39:47.085
He likes to stand over there and
throw knives at the door.

01:39:47.085 --> 01:39:49.640
So then my parents thought,
well, maybe that's just a

01:39:49.640 --> 01:39:51.380
little too unsupervised.

01:39:51.380 --> 01:39:54.710
Especially if the child is
across the Atlantic from us.

01:39:54.710 --> 01:39:57.380
And it's not really easy to see
how things are going and

01:39:57.380 --> 01:39:59.320
intervene if things aren't
going so well.

01:39:59.320 --> 01:40:00.980
So they decided not to send
me to Summerhill.

01:40:00.980 --> 01:40:03.620
But they sent me to progressive
nursery schools

01:40:03.620 --> 01:40:04.870
locally as well.

01:40:04.870 --> 01:40:08.020
And I have good memories
of those too.

01:40:08.020 --> 01:40:12.200
So yeah, I would say there's a
fundamental point in there,

01:40:12.200 --> 01:40:15.526
which is there's a difference
between freedom and license.

01:40:15.526 --> 01:40:18.940
And so this is a distinction
not often made.

01:40:18.940 --> 01:40:23.510
So license is the bad pole
and freedom is the good.

01:40:23.510 --> 01:40:25.580
This is how I'm splitting
the two parts.

01:40:25.580 --> 01:40:28.360
So license is just do
whatever you want.

01:40:28.360 --> 01:40:30.630
Take drugs.

01:40:30.630 --> 01:40:31.260
Be a prostitute.

01:40:31.260 --> 01:40:32.430
Do whatever you want.

01:40:32.430 --> 01:40:33.680
You're free.

01:40:33.680 --> 01:40:34.870
Well, that's not
really freedom.

01:40:34.870 --> 01:40:37.200
You're licensed.

01:40:37.200 --> 01:40:39.070
Whereas freedom--

01:40:39.070 --> 01:40:42.210
in my mind-- has some intrinsic
regulation on it.

01:40:42.210 --> 01:40:43.090
You're free.

01:40:43.090 --> 01:40:44.550
You're a free creature.

01:40:44.550 --> 01:40:47.140
You have responsibility to
use that freedom well.

01:40:47.140 --> 01:40:49.680
And license doesn't have any
of that responsibility.

01:40:49.680 --> 01:40:53.150
So I think when one is designing
curricula like that

01:40:53.150 --> 01:40:55.880
you have to try to make the
norm such that freedom is

01:40:55.880 --> 01:40:57.710
promoted and not license.

01:40:57.710 --> 01:41:00.070
Now, to some extent, you can't
avoid a bit of license.

01:41:00.070 --> 01:41:03.160
Because, for example, the
Summerhill teachers say that

01:41:03.160 --> 01:41:05.610
when students come from regular
schools where they've

01:41:05.610 --> 01:41:11.690
been basically competing with
each other, basically feeling

01:41:11.690 --> 01:41:14.700
beaten down, some of them come
to Summerhill and just do

01:41:14.700 --> 01:41:16.150
nothing for a year.

01:41:16.150 --> 01:41:19.730
They just sit outside and play
on the swings and in the

01:41:19.730 --> 01:41:21.730
creek, just for a year.

01:41:21.730 --> 01:41:24.350
It takes them a year of
detoxification before they are

01:41:24.350 --> 01:41:26.550
ready to go back into
the classroom and

01:41:26.550 --> 01:41:28.100
learn things formally.

01:41:28.100 --> 01:41:30.200
So you could say that's
a bit of license.

01:41:30.200 --> 01:41:32.410
But maybe that's a bit
of necessary license.

01:41:32.410 --> 01:41:34.070
Or maybe they're actually just

01:41:34.070 --> 01:41:35.660
discovering how to use freedom.

01:41:35.660 --> 01:41:37.570
And it takes them a year because
they never had any

01:41:37.570 --> 01:41:39.400
practice with that.

01:41:39.400 --> 01:41:41.960
So I think it's important
to keep

01:41:41.960 --> 01:41:43.545
those two pieces separate.

01:41:46.060 --> 01:41:48.450
OK, so now there's so
many questions.

01:41:48.450 --> 01:41:51.660
OK so there's two that I
think are particularly

01:41:51.660 --> 01:41:52.820
important to discuss.

01:41:52.820 --> 01:41:56.760
So there was a comment that one
of the Alfie Kohn readings

01:41:56.760 --> 01:42:02.730
was off putting because he made
comments about people

01:42:02.730 --> 01:42:04.910
with different political views
than his and he seemed like a

01:42:04.910 --> 01:42:07.570
left-wing nut.

01:42:07.570 --> 01:42:11.060
And that, therefore, that
reading shouldn't be assigned.

01:42:11.060 --> 01:42:14.080
So yeah, I agree that if you
have quite a different

01:42:14.080 --> 01:42:16.630
political view than Alfie Kohn
it can be a bit off putting.

01:42:16.630 --> 01:42:19.400
But actually, I think
that's a good thing.

01:42:19.400 --> 01:42:21.380
Now why is that?

01:42:21.380 --> 01:42:25.410
It's because it's fundamentally
important to

01:42:25.410 --> 01:42:29.190
find views that challenge you
and read them anyway.

01:42:29.190 --> 01:42:31.800
So as you probably guessed,
most of my views are not

01:42:31.800 --> 01:42:32.630
mainstream.

01:42:32.630 --> 01:42:35.290
So I do that all the time
whether I like it or not, just

01:42:35.290 --> 01:42:37.690
when I open the paper, or if I
happen to watch television,

01:42:37.690 --> 01:42:39.330
which I actually don't
hardly at all.

01:42:39.330 --> 01:42:44.480
But if I open the newspaper or
read things, just right next

01:42:44.480 --> 01:42:47.520
to my office there was
a teaching magazine.

01:42:47.520 --> 01:42:48.520
I forget what is called.

01:42:48.520 --> 01:42:49.300
Prism maybe?

01:42:49.300 --> 01:42:51.200
I forget the name
of the magazine.

01:42:51.200 --> 01:42:52.795
But it's on the magazine
display.

01:42:52.795 --> 01:42:54.610
And I just was walking by.

01:42:54.610 --> 01:42:58.340
And turned my head this
way to read the title

01:42:58.340 --> 01:42:59.330
on the front cover.

01:42:59.330 --> 01:43:08.990
And it said cash incentives
are proving successful for

01:43:08.990 --> 01:43:10.800
promoting student learning.

01:43:10.800 --> 01:43:13.780
So this was against everything
I believed in.

01:43:13.780 --> 01:43:17.110
So if I have the time I'll
actually read the article.

01:43:17.110 --> 01:43:19.450
But I'm surrounded by things
I disagree with.

01:43:19.450 --> 01:43:21.180
And I think that's actually
pretty healthy.

01:43:21.180 --> 01:43:23.125
So if you disagree with
the article read

01:43:23.125 --> 01:43:24.375
it all the way through.

01:43:26.920 --> 01:43:31.100
And the law professor Cass
Sonstein from Chicago--

01:43:31.100 --> 01:43:33.260
who's talked about as being
a possible Supreme

01:43:33.260 --> 01:43:36.460
Court nominee by Obama--

01:43:36.460 --> 01:43:41.510
he's written eloquently about
the dangers of not doing that.

01:43:41.510 --> 01:43:45.290
Because it wasn't so possible
50 years ago.

01:43:45.290 --> 01:43:47.840
There was large-circulation
newspapers and maybe two,

01:43:47.840 --> 01:43:49.290
three in each town.

01:43:49.290 --> 01:43:50.940
And people read those.

01:43:50.940 --> 01:43:54.060
There was a common discourse
through that.

01:43:54.060 --> 01:43:56.780
But now, everyone can get their
own particular news on

01:43:56.780 --> 01:43:57.720
the internet.

01:43:57.720 --> 01:43:57.813
Right?

01:43:57.813 --> 01:44:01.640
You can get your own views from
this small journal or

01:44:01.640 --> 01:44:04.220
from that particular newspaper
or this person writing an

01:44:04.220 --> 01:44:06.400
article that you happen
to agree with.

01:44:06.400 --> 01:44:09.600
And the danger is of people
just collecting into small

01:44:09.600 --> 01:44:14.260
little micro communities, where
each community just

01:44:14.260 --> 01:44:17.680
agrees with itself and only
reads things and discusses

01:44:17.680 --> 01:44:19.010
things that they agree with.

01:44:19.010 --> 01:44:21.430
And that's very unhealthy for
democracy he points out, which

01:44:21.430 --> 01:44:22.920
I think is right.

01:44:22.920 --> 01:44:25.300
So I think it's very important
to actually seek out things

01:44:25.300 --> 01:44:26.010
you disagree with.

01:44:26.010 --> 01:44:28.800
And so if I happen to give you
a reading that at first you

01:44:28.800 --> 01:44:33.020
disagreed with it's not
such a bad thing.

01:44:33.020 --> 01:44:37.430
And it belongs, for sure, in
an academic curriculum.

01:44:37.430 --> 01:44:39.920
Because that's one of the
purposes of an academic

01:44:39.920 --> 01:44:40.730
curriculum.

01:44:40.730 --> 01:44:45.660
The word university comes from--
it has Uni in it, one.

01:44:45.660 --> 01:44:47.300
So the idea is it's
one universe.

01:44:47.300 --> 01:44:53.460
All ideas are open discussion,
even ones we disagree with.

01:44:53.460 --> 01:44:54.920
OK, so let's see.

01:45:07.970 --> 01:45:12.650
OK, then the related one is, I
find it off putting when I put

01:45:12.650 --> 01:45:14.940
my personal biases and
opinions as absolute.

01:45:14.940 --> 01:45:17.200
For example, programming--

01:45:17.200 --> 01:45:18.860
and this is related to
the last point--

01:45:18.860 --> 01:45:21.400
programming LaTeX may
be easier and more

01:45:21.400 --> 01:45:22.250
convenient for me.

01:45:22.250 --> 01:45:24.980
But it's possible to develop
familiarity with other

01:45:24.980 --> 01:45:27.530
software and systems that
makes them close to

01:45:27.530 --> 01:45:30.540
equivalent, if not equivalent.

01:45:30.540 --> 01:45:32.380
That may be true.

01:45:32.380 --> 01:45:35.540
Though I think there's
fundamental reasons to

01:45:35.540 --> 01:45:36.360
wonder about it.

01:45:36.360 --> 01:45:43.400
Just because By not using a
system such as LaTeX or Tex.

01:45:43.400 --> 01:45:45.760
What's common about all of them
is that you program them.

01:45:45.760 --> 01:45:48.290
And by not using a system like
that, you give up the ability

01:45:48.290 --> 01:45:49.540
to program.

01:45:49.540 --> 01:45:52.200
And that is a huge loss.

01:45:52.200 --> 01:45:54.370
You can see it, how much
can computers do?

01:45:54.370 --> 01:45:55.900
The way computers are
so powerful is

01:45:55.900 --> 01:45:57.280
because we program them.

01:45:57.280 --> 01:46:00.700
And the fundamental recipe
for programming is--

01:46:00.700 --> 01:46:01.930
at least when I teach it--

01:46:01.930 --> 01:46:03.180
this--

01:46:07.320 --> 01:46:10.845
So this is how the fundamental
idea of programming I think.

01:46:10.845 --> 01:46:16.740
So you do something and
then you do it again.

01:46:20.140 --> 01:46:21.950
And when you're doing it
again, you're like,

01:46:21.950 --> 01:46:23.550
oh, I just did this.

01:46:23.550 --> 01:46:25.060
Maybe I should write
a program.

01:46:25.060 --> 01:46:26.120
Nah, I'm too lazy.

01:46:26.120 --> 01:46:29.020
But then the third time
it happens again.

01:46:29.020 --> 01:46:31.060
And you're like, OK,
bloody hell, this

01:46:31.060 --> 01:46:32.310
time write a program.

01:46:36.680 --> 01:46:39.190
OK, so basically the recipe is
the third time you're about to

01:46:39.190 --> 01:46:41.070
do something, don't do it.

01:46:41.070 --> 01:46:42.160
Write a program to do it.

01:46:42.160 --> 01:46:46.460
So now you have a little mini
program that you can reuse.

01:46:46.460 --> 01:46:47.800
Now it's a new module.

01:46:47.800 --> 01:46:50.570
And you can use that module to
build still new programs.

01:46:50.570 --> 01:46:54.380
You can build a huge
power abstraction.

01:46:54.380 --> 01:46:56.890
So for example, in the
figure-drawing program you can

01:46:56.890 --> 01:47:00.550
actually write programs
that generate trees.

01:47:00.550 --> 01:47:03.580
And then you can write
a five-line script.

01:47:03.580 --> 01:47:05.270
And you say, OK, feed
that through my

01:47:05.270 --> 01:47:06.360
tree-generating program.

01:47:06.360 --> 01:47:09.340
And it'll make a tree that you
can use in your figures, in

01:47:09.340 --> 01:47:10.860
your talks, or in your books.

01:47:10.860 --> 01:47:13.070
So I'll post a few
examples of that.

01:47:13.070 --> 01:47:16.310
The input as five-line tree
and the output PDF.

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:21.420
So the first time you write that
program it takes longer

01:47:21.420 --> 01:47:23.710
than doing it graphically,
no question.

01:47:23.710 --> 01:47:26.680
Which is why this second
part happens.

01:47:26.680 --> 01:47:29.490
Because you do it the slightly
hard way the first time.

01:47:29.490 --> 01:47:31.100
You don't realize the second
time you're like, oh, there's

01:47:31.100 --> 01:47:32.830
something in common here.

01:47:32.830 --> 01:47:33.240
[BUZZER SOUND]

01:47:33.240 --> 01:47:34.300
But it's too late.

01:47:34.300 --> 01:47:35.820
I just have to do it the
slightly hard way.

01:47:35.820 --> 01:47:38.420
The third time you think, OK,
finally I'm going to do it

01:47:38.420 --> 01:47:39.190
with the program.

01:47:39.190 --> 01:47:42.760
So I think there are fundamental
reasons to think

01:47:42.760 --> 01:47:45.440
that if you can program
your documents you'll

01:47:45.440 --> 01:47:47.620
also be more efficient.

01:47:47.620 --> 01:47:51.610
Now, that actually may end
up not being true.

01:47:51.610 --> 01:47:52.650
I suspect it is.

01:47:52.650 --> 01:47:53.290
But it may not be.

01:47:53.290 --> 01:47:58.680
But even if it isn't take
it as not an absolute.

01:47:58.680 --> 01:48:01.840
But as a suggestion to
try in your own work

01:48:01.840 --> 01:48:03.680
and in your own writing.

01:48:03.680 --> 01:48:06.770
And I don't mean it
as an absolute.

01:48:06.770 --> 01:48:08.900
OK, so now there's 10
more questions.

01:48:08.900 --> 01:48:12.480
But I'm going to leave
them for now.

01:48:12.480 --> 01:48:14.560
And if at the end we haven't
used up all the time with

01:48:14.560 --> 01:48:16.500
questions I'll continue with
some of those questions.

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:24.500
PROFESSOR: OK, guys.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.490
We're actually
slightly ahead of where

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.500
I thought we'd be at
this point, so I'm only

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.900
going to spend about
half of today's lecture

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.120
finishing up some new
material on mass parabolas

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.200
and stability.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.368
I also got a comment in
through the anonymous box

00:00:36.368 --> 00:00:38.160
that said please leave
a little bit of time

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.098
after class for questions.

00:00:40.098 --> 00:00:42.390
So you can get them out right
away, because I'm usually

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.348
running off to teach some
other class at, like,

00:00:44.348 --> 00:00:46.283
the IDC or some other building.

00:00:46.283 --> 00:00:47.700
So from now on,
I'll try and leave

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.320
about five minutes
at the end of class

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.090
for questions on
today's material,

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.180
and we'll make up with the
second half-hour or 25 minutes

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.740
of this class being for all
the questions on the material

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:58.547
so far in the first two weeks.

00:00:58.547 --> 00:01:00.630
But first I wanted to give
a quick review of where

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:03.780
we were Wednesday and launch
back into mass parabolas, which

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.170
are ways of looking at nuclear
stability in relative numbers

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.370
and even or oddness of nuclei.

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:11.100
So you saw last
time we intuitively

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.860
derived the semi-empirical
mass formula

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.620
as a sum of volume,
surface, coulomb, asymmetry,

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:23.850
and pairing, or whether things
are even-even or odd-even terms

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.140
with the coefficients in
MeV gleaned from data,

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.770
and the forms of the-- and the
exponents right here gleaned

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.420
from intuition.

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.950
Here we assume that
the nucleus can

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.010
be thought of like a big drop
of liquid with some charged

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:39.400
particles in it.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.430
And so the droplet
should become more stable

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.820
the more nuclei there are-- or
the more nucleons there are.

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.740
But then you have
some more outside

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.840
on the surface that aren't
bonded to the others.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.388
All of the protons are repelling
each other over linear length

00:01:52.388 --> 00:01:54.305
scales, because the
radius of this liquid drop

00:01:54.305 --> 00:01:56.560
would scale like A to the 1/3.

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.130
There's an asymmetry term,
which means if the neutrons

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.470
and protons are out
of balance, there's

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.548
going to be some
less binding energy.

00:02:04.548 --> 00:02:06.090
And then there's
this extra part that

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.780
tells you whether the nuclei
are even-even or odd-odd.

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.820
And this works pretty well.

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.580
If you remember, we looked
at theory versus experiment

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.910
where all the red points here
are theoretical predictions,

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.730
and all the black points are
experimental predictions.

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.560
And for the most part,
they look spot-on.

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.650
It generates the classic
binding energy per nucleon

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.540
curve that you see
in the textbook

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.660
and can predict from the
semi-empirical mass formula.

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.570
Zooming in and correcting
for, let's say,

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.740
just getting absolute
values of errors,

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:38.880
you can see that, except
for the very small nuclei

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.160
and a few peaks,
which we explained

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.130
by looking even closer,
the formula, well,

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.085
it predicts nuclear stability
quite well on average.

00:02:48.085 --> 00:02:49.710
Again, this line
right here, if there's

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:51.790
a dot that lies
on this blue line,

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:54.660
it means that theory
and experiment agree.

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.860
And a deviation by a few MeV
here and there, not too bad.

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.620
But we started also looking
at different nuclear stability

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.610
trends, and we noticed that
for odd mass number nuclei,

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:10.500
there's usually only one or
sometimes none stable isotopes

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.830
per Z, whereas for even ones,
there's quite a few more.

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.540
And we're going to
be now linking up

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.600
the stability of nuclei
versus what mode of decay

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.590
they will take in order to find
a more stable configuration.

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.650
We looked quickly at the number
of stable nuclei with even

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.370
and odd Z and noted that
these places right here where

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.300
there are no stable nuclei
correspond to technetium

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:34.740
and promethium.

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:37.000
There's no periodic table
on the back of this wall,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.765
but behind my back
on the other wall,

00:03:38.765 --> 00:03:40.140
there's that
periodic table where

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.510
you can see the two
elements that are fairly

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.340
light with no stable isotopes.

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.290
That's what those correspond to.

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.950
And the peaks correspond to
what we call magic numbers

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.650
or numbers of
protons or neutrons

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.630
where all available
states at some energy

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.040
are pretty much filled.

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.050
And this goes for both
protons and neutrons.

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:03.180
So something with a magic number
for both n, number of neutrons,

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:04.740
and Z, number of
protons, is going

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:06.625
to be exceptionally stable.

00:04:06.625 --> 00:04:08.250
And we'll see how
that's used as a tool

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:11.370
to synthesize the super heavy
elements that we believe

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.070
should exist.

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:16.470
And finally we got into
these mass parabolas.

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:18.750
I found this to be a
particularly difficult concept

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.640
to just get mathematically.

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:23.700
If you remember, we wrote out
the semi-empirical mass formula

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.880
and said if you take the
derivative with respect to Z,

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:31.550
as we did it, you would get the
most stable z for a given A.

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:34.350
And we started graphing
for a equals 93

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:36.782
where niobium is stable.

00:04:36.782 --> 00:04:39.240
That was just the one I had on
the brain from some failures

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.460
in lab earlier this week.

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:44.830
We started plotting
where those nuclei--

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:48.150
what is it-- the relative
masses are for a fixed A. So

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:49.830
let's regenerate
that one right now,

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:52.290
because we were a little fast
at the end of last lecture.

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:56.132
Then I want to generate
one for a equals 40.

00:04:56.132 --> 00:04:57.840
And you'll see something
kind of curious.

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.090
I'm going to leave
this up here for a sec.

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:03.150
If you notice, for
odd A nuclei, there's

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:06.895
only one parabola, whereas
for even A, there are two.

00:05:06.895 --> 00:05:08.520
Why that is, we're
going to see when we

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.090
look at the table of nuclides.

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:12.450
But notice this
nucleus right here

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:16.230
can decay by either positron
emission or beta emission

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:17.520
to get to a more stable form.

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:18.895
And there are many
real examples,

00:05:18.895 --> 00:05:22.270
and I'm going to show
you how to find them.

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:26.160
So let's start off by going
back to the table of nuclides,

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.330
finding niobium-93.

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:32.520
Just go up one more chunk.

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.650
And there we are.

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:38.280
Niobium-93 is a stable isotope.

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:40.030
And if you want to see
where it came from,

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:43.080
you can scroll down a little
bit and see its possible parent

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.010
nuclides right here.

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:47.670
So let's say that niobium--

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:49.560
we'll draw it right there--

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:50.190
is stable.

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:52.850
We'll put it at the
bottom of this parabola.

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:57.560
And let's work down in Z.
So we'll move to zirconium.

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:02.240
Zirconium-93 ostensibly has
a very similar atomic mass.

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:07.040
But if you remember that 93 AMU
is a rather poor approximation

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:11.180
for the actual mass of all
nuclei with A equals 93.

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:14.330
In fact, if you look very
closely at the atomic masses,

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:18.660
zirconium-93 is 92.90.

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:21.060
Niobium-93, well,
it looks like we

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:23.310
have to go all the way
to another digit there.

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:26.560
92.906.

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:31.680
You have to go to, like,
even more digits 92.906375,

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:34.290
92.906475.

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:36.270
So we go down in Z,
and we've actually

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:40.170
gone up in mass by looks like
the sixth or seventh digit

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:41.470
in AMU.

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:44.430
If we go up in mass, we
go down in binding energy.

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:47.010
That tells us that there's
something that's less stable.

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:49.650
And if you notice, we went
down by a very small--

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:52.950
or we went up by a very
small amount of mass.

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:56.820
Notice also that its beta decay
energy is really, really small,

00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:59.070
91 kiloelectron volts.

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:03.670
So why don't we put
zirconium just above?

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:05.390
And we note that that
decay will happen

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:09.860
by beta, where the
beta, let's say

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:14.280
if we have an isotope with
mass number A, protons Z,

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:17.030
and let's just call it
symbol question mark.

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:20.810
In beta decay, we
have the same A.

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:22.820
We'll have a different
Z. We're going

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:24.740
to have to give these symbols.

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:28.880
Let's call this parent, and
we'll call that daughter.

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:32.517
Plus a beta, plus an
electron antineutrino.

00:07:32.517 --> 00:07:34.850
And what has to happen to
that Z in order for everything

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:36.980
to be conserved?

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:39.750
It's the same reaction
that we've got here for--

00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:41.640
I'm sorry-- for zirconium.

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:47.100
So you'd have to have one fewer
proton to release one electron.

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:49.320
And so that becomes
same A but different Z.

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:51.120
And this is the
beta decay reaction.

00:07:56.670 --> 00:07:58.560
Let's go back a little farther.

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:00.645
We'll look at the possible
parent nuclide for--

00:08:00.645 --> 00:08:01.770
did anyone have a question?

00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:06.560
AUDIENCE: Don't you need
one more proton [INAUDIBLE]??

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:07.600
PROFESSOR: Let's see.

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:09.580
Which direction are
we going in Z here?

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:14.252
That goes to yttrium.

00:08:14.252 --> 00:08:16.298
It actually looks
like it's going down.

00:08:16.298 --> 00:08:17.340
Oh, yeah, for beta decay.

00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:21.030
I'm thinking-- I have
the reaction backwards.

00:08:21.030 --> 00:08:22.870
Sorry.

00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:25.380
I need one more
proton to account

00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:26.630
for the extra negative charge.

00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:27.750
You're right.

00:08:27.750 --> 00:08:28.290
OK.

00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:30.290
Yep, I was thinking
backwards, because we're now

00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:32.799
climbing up the decay
chain in reverse order.

00:08:32.799 --> 00:08:35.980
So this could have come
from yttrium-93 with a much

00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:37.480
higher energy of three MeV.

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:40.809
So let's put yttrium right here.

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:46.330
That gives a beta decay.

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:52.750
And we'll just go one more
back to strontium-93 Has

00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:56.507
an even higher
beta decay energy.

00:08:56.507 --> 00:08:57.590
So let's put that up here.

00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:03.120
And let's take a look
at its mass real quick.

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:08.270
The mass of
strontium-93, 92.914 AMU.

00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:13.290
If we go back to
niobium-93, now it's

00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:16.410
noticeably different to,
like, four significant digits

00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:17.178
instead of six.

00:09:17.178 --> 00:09:21.540
92.914 versus 92.906.

00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:24.780
And so that shows you that
a tiny bit of mass and AMU

00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:26.850
corresponds to a pretty
significant change

00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:30.450
in binding energy by that
same conversion factor

00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:33.630
that we've been
using everywhere.

00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:45.910
931.49 AMU per big
MeV per C squared.

00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:47.570
Let's see.

00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:48.170
Yeah.

00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:48.670
OK.

00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:53.690
So let's go now in the other
direction, in the positron

00:09:53.690 --> 00:09:54.900
direction.

00:09:54.900 --> 00:10:00.410
Niobium can also be
made by electron capture

00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:01.820
from molybdenum.

00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:05.860
So let's put
molybdenum right here.

00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:08.113
Let's say that around half an--

00:10:08.113 --> 00:10:09.030
what did we have here?

00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:10.030
It was like half an MeV.

00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:15.697
Like that.

00:10:15.697 --> 00:10:16.280
And let's see.

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:19.670
Molybdenum-93 could have
been made by electron capture

00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:24.905
from technetium-93 with
an energy of 3.201 MeV,

00:10:24.905 --> 00:10:25.655
even more extreme.

00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:34.080
We'll go back one more, because
there's a trend that I want

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:35.850
you guys to be able to see.

00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:37.830
And this could have come
from electron capture

00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:40.620
from ruthenium.

00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:42.570
I think I may have said
rubidium last time,

00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:44.350
but Ru is ruthenium-93.

00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:52.740
And that 6.3 MeV,
something like that.

00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:55.400
And this is where
we got to yesterday.

00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:57.950
Now I'd like us to take a
closer look at the decay

00:10:57.950 --> 00:11:01.640
diagrams, which tells us what
possible decay reactions can

00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:04.580
happen in each of
these reactions.

00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:06.080
Since we're right
here on the chart,

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:10.520
let's take a look at ruthenium
turning into technetium by what

00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:11.840
it says, electron capture.

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:14.900
So note that on the table, you
can click on electron capture,

00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:17.870
and if it's highlighted, then
the decay diagrams are known.

00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:20.150
It's not known
for every isotope,

00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:23.020
but for a lot of the ones
you'll be dealing with, it is.

00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:26.990
And you get something I
have to zoom out for--

00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:29.600
a lot, a lot of
different decays.

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:32.150
What I want you to look at is
this one here on the bottom

00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:35.400
that I'll zoom in to.

00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:37.740
That should be a
little more visible.

00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:42.100
So notice that if you want to
go down the entire 6.4-something

00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:51.180
MeV, it usually proceeds by
B-plus or positron decay,

00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:52.980
by either method.

00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:56.160
And as you go up the chain, as
these energy differences get

00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:59.130
smaller, look what
happens to the probability

00:11:59.130 --> 00:12:00.900
of getting positron decay.

00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:03.060
It shrinks lower
and lower and lower.

00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:05.220
So there's a trend that
the larger the decay

00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:08.310
energy for this type of
reaction, the more likely

00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:10.710
you're going to
get positron decay.

00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:13.650
And in fact, where we left
off last time is in order

00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:18.120
to get positron decay, the
Q value of the reaction

00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:23.730
has to be at least
1.022 MeV, better known

00:12:23.730 --> 00:12:29.940
as at least two times the
rest mass of the electron,

00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:32.580
because in this case, to
conserve charge and energy,

00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:34.890
you shoot out a
positron, and you also

00:12:34.890 --> 00:12:36.960
have to eject an
electron in order

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:40.160
to conserve all the
charge going on here.

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:42.940
So there you have it.

00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:47.670
Now let's look at the lower
energy decay of technetium

00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:49.230
to molybdenum,
which had something

00:12:49.230 --> 00:12:52.620
like 3 MeV associated with it.

00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:57.790
So we'll click on technetium,
and its energy is 3.2 MeV.

00:12:57.790 --> 00:13:00.820
Let's take a look at
its electron capture.

00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:03.430
Significantly simpler.

00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:05.920
Already what do you notice
about these positron

00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:07.045
to electron capture ratios?

00:13:09.568 --> 00:13:10.360
Anyone call it out.

00:13:14.072 --> 00:13:16.280
AUDIENCE: Electron capture
is much more likely.

00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:17.030
PROFESSOR: Indeed.

00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:19.070
When the energy of
the decay goes down--

00:13:19.070 --> 00:13:21.980
notice that only these
decays are allowed--

00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:25.040
The electron capture suddenly
becomes much more likely.

00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:27.320
But notice that it does
not let you go directly

00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:29.760
from 3.2 MeV to 0.

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:31.850
There is no
allowable decay here.

00:13:31.850 --> 00:13:35.240
So this is probably a
change of-- that's 3.2.

00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:36.830
That's 1.3.

00:13:36.830 --> 00:13:38.840
A little less than 2 MeV.

00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:40.280
All of a sudden,
electron capture

00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:43.880
becomes much more likely,
but positron decay

00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:46.430
is not disallowed yet.

00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:50.910
So we can say electron capture
or positron decay right there.

00:13:50.910 --> 00:13:53.450
Everyone with me so far?

00:13:53.450 --> 00:13:56.130
So let's go to the
really low energy one.

00:13:56.130 --> 00:13:58.840
We'll click on
molybdenum-93 and see

00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:02.830
how it decays with an energy
of 0.405 MeV to niobium.

00:14:02.830 --> 00:14:06.224
Anyone want to guess
what's allowed?

00:14:06.224 --> 00:14:08.000
AUDIENCE: Electron capture only.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:09.830
PROFESSOR: Electron
capture only.

00:14:09.830 --> 00:14:12.590
There's not enough energy
for positron decay.

00:14:12.590 --> 00:14:14.480
And, indeed, it draws
funny, because there's

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:16.170
a metastable state.

00:14:16.170 --> 00:14:17.990
But if you scroll
down here, there

00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:21.960
are two pathways allowed, both
of which by electron capture.

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:24.132
Decay diagram's
quite a bit simpler.

00:14:24.132 --> 00:14:26.090
So we leave this one here
by saying it can only

00:14:26.090 --> 00:14:27.830
decay by electron capture.

00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:33.120
Any questions on
the odd A before we

00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:38.130
move on to the even, which
is a little more interesting?

00:14:38.130 --> 00:14:38.710
Cool.

00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:40.080
OK.

00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:42.300
Let's move on to the even case.

00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:43.950
So for here, I'm
going to go back

00:14:43.950 --> 00:14:48.030
to the overall picture
of the table of nuclides.

00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:51.630
Click on around where I
think potassium-40 is.

00:14:51.630 --> 00:14:54.020
Looks like I got there.

00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:56.310
And I want to point out
one of these features.

00:14:56.310 --> 00:14:58.890
If you wanted to
undergo decay change

00:14:58.890 --> 00:15:01.530
and maintain the
same mass number,

00:15:01.530 --> 00:15:04.140
that's diagonally from
upper left to lower right.

00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:08.580
See how all the isotopes here
have a 40 in front of them.

00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:11.580
The really interesting part
is as you cross this line,

00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:16.350
you go from stable to unstable
to stable to unstable again.

00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:19.230
The colors here is dark
blue represents stable,

00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:21.870
and dark gray represents
long lifetimes

00:15:21.870 --> 00:15:24.330
of over 100,000 years.

00:15:24.330 --> 00:15:27.168
So this is one of the
reasons you find potassium-40

00:15:27.168 --> 00:15:27.960
in the environment.

00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:32.550
In fact, 0.011% of all
potassium in you and everything

00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:33.990
is potassium-40.

00:15:33.990 --> 00:15:36.810
It's what's known as
a primordial nuclide.

00:15:36.810 --> 00:15:38.970
It's not stable,
but its half-life

00:15:38.970 --> 00:15:42.010
is so long that
there's still some

00:15:42.010 --> 00:15:45.190
left since the universe
began or whatever

00:15:45.190 --> 00:15:49.560
supernova that formed Earth
got accumulated into the earth.

00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:51.613
But notice it can come from--

00:15:51.613 --> 00:15:53.530
it can decay by a couple
of different methods.

00:15:53.530 --> 00:15:57.600
So let's pick one of those
stable isotopes, calcium-40,

00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:01.930
and put that as the bottom of
the parabola on this diagram.

00:16:01.930 --> 00:16:03.700
So we'll put calcium here.

00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:08.160
And in a relative sense, we'll
put a calcium point right there

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:10.230
for its total mass.

00:16:10.230 --> 00:16:12.510
And it could have
come from beta decay

00:16:12.510 --> 00:16:19.330
from potassium-40 or electron
capture from scandium-40 40.

00:16:19.330 --> 00:16:21.430
So let's look at potassium-40.

00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:26.760
It can beta decay for
about, oh, 1.3 MeV.

00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:30.150
So potassium is right here.

00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:36.520
Let's say it could beta
decay with about 1.3 MeV.

00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:40.320
And we'll trace potassium
back a little bit,

00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:43.950
figure out where would
it have come from.

00:16:43.950 --> 00:16:45.510
Interesting.

00:16:45.510 --> 00:16:46.660
Doesn't tell us.

00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:49.160
OK, forget that.

00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:56.290
Let's trace calcium back
and say there's scandium-40.

00:16:56.290 --> 00:16:59.030
And scandium-40 can
decay with-- wow--

00:16:59.030 --> 00:17:04.430
an enormous 14.32 MeV.

00:17:04.430 --> 00:17:05.900
Let's put that like here.

00:17:12.050 --> 00:17:15.609
Anyone want to guess which mode,
electron capture or positrons,

00:17:15.609 --> 00:17:16.390
much more likely?

00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:18.121
AUDIENCE: I think positrons.

00:17:18.121 --> 00:17:19.329
PROFESSOR: Probably positron.

00:17:19.329 --> 00:17:22.180
Let's take a look.

00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:22.960
Oh boy.

00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:25.030
Another complicated one.

00:17:25.030 --> 00:17:27.190
But the whole way down,
positron, positron,

00:17:27.190 --> 00:17:30.280
positron for all the
most likely decays.

00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:33.370
You won't find a drawing
to every single line.

00:17:33.370 --> 00:17:35.650
I believe that they
know that at some point,

00:17:35.650 --> 00:17:38.290
drawing extra lines is futile,
and they just all overlap

00:17:38.290 --> 00:17:39.130
each other.

00:17:39.130 --> 00:17:41.560
So I don't know exactly
how the algorithm works,

00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:44.930
but it does draw up to some
number of possible decay

00:17:44.930 --> 00:17:45.430
chains.

00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:48.160
If you want to see
every single one,

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:53.058
they are tabulated in a very,
very long list down below.

00:17:53.058 --> 00:17:55.600
I'm never going to ask you to
do something with all of these,

00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:57.670
because that would
be insane unless it's

00:17:57.670 --> 00:18:00.340
a relatively simple
decay, like that

00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:03.140
has two or three possibilities.

00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:04.490
And let's see.

00:18:04.490 --> 00:18:06.320
This could have come
from electron capture

00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:11.210
from titanium-40 with 11.68 MeV.

00:18:11.210 --> 00:18:11.810
Wow.

00:18:11.810 --> 00:18:13.830
OK.

00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:14.330
Up here.

00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:20.880
And there's titanium.

00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:25.990
And let's go in the
other direction.

00:18:25.990 --> 00:18:31.780
So I do know that potassium-40
can decay into argon-40.

00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:36.330
So let's jump there.

00:18:36.330 --> 00:18:39.280
Argon is a stable isotope too.

00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:45.800
So potassium-40 can decay into
argon-40 by electron capture.

00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:46.300
OK, good.

00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:56.150
A more respectable 1.505 MeV.

00:18:56.150 --> 00:18:57.380
Is positron decay allowed?

00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:02.630
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:03.260
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:03.760
Why is that?

00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:07.800
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:10.200
PROFESSOR: Over 1.022 MeV.

00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:10.920
Yeah.

00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:12.720
Anyone have a question?

00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:13.220
No?

00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:14.218
OK.

00:19:14.218 --> 00:19:16.260
So we've got kind of a
kink in our mass parabola.

00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:16.790
Yeah?

00:19:16.790 --> 00:19:18.165
AUDIENCE: Actually,
yeah, so it's

00:19:18.165 --> 00:19:20.777
possible if it's over 1.022,
but it's still very unlikely.

00:19:20.777 --> 00:19:21.860
PROFESSOR: That's correct.

00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:24.480
AUDIENCE: Until we get to
these higher orders, like 10.

00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:26.610
PROFESSOR: Yep, so once
the Q value's satisfied,

00:19:26.610 --> 00:19:28.045
it is technically possible.

00:19:28.045 --> 00:19:29.670
But if you had
something with the decay

00:19:29.670 --> 00:19:34.080
energy of, like, 1.023 MeV, it
would be exceedingly unlikely.

00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:36.090
So in fact, we can
take a look at this.

00:19:36.090 --> 00:19:37.740
This, I would say,
is also going to be

00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:41.120
on the exceedingly unlikely
level, and we can take a look.

00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:44.030
So if we look at
the decay diagram,

00:19:44.030 --> 00:19:45.410
we know it makes positrons.

00:19:45.410 --> 00:19:48.010
They're not even really listed.

00:19:48.010 --> 00:19:49.810
Interesting.

00:19:49.810 --> 00:19:51.910
So that process
would not be allowed,

00:19:51.910 --> 00:19:55.210
but this one, because
that's about 1.5 MeV,

00:19:55.210 --> 00:19:55.990
should be allowed.

00:19:55.990 --> 00:19:59.170
But since that branch
ratio or the probability

00:19:59.170 --> 00:20:02.020
of that happening is already so
low, I wonder if it even says.

00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:08.980
Yep, beta ray with a max or
average energy of 482.8 MeV.

00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:11.230
We're going to go over why
that energy is so low when

00:20:11.230 --> 00:20:13.180
we talk about decay next week.

00:20:13.180 --> 00:20:15.700
With the relative intensity of
something with a lot of zeros

00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:17.800
before the decimal place.

00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:18.480
So there you go.

00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:23.100
Like you said, energies near
1.022 MeV, slightly above it,

00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:29.325
are extremely unlikely but
possible and measurable.

00:20:29.325 --> 00:20:30.670
Cool.

00:20:30.670 --> 00:20:36.420
And then let's see what
could have made argon 40.

00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:41.290
Could have been beta
decay from chlorine-40.

00:20:41.290 --> 00:20:43.060
So chlorine maybe was here.

00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:48.450
And I don't think I
have to draw any more.

00:20:48.450 --> 00:20:51.570
So we've got a funny-looking
parabola with a kink in it,

00:20:51.570 --> 00:20:54.640
because really, you have two
mass parabolas overlapping.

00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:56.520
I'm going to go
back to the screen

00:20:56.520 --> 00:20:58.290
so that the diagram
from the notes

00:20:58.290 --> 00:20:59.980
makes a little more sense.

00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:01.980
What we've kind
of traced out here

00:21:01.980 --> 00:21:09.050
is that there's two
overlapping parabolas here.

00:21:09.050 --> 00:21:11.120
There's the one
with the-- what is

00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:14.120
it-- the odd Z and the even Z.

00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:15.363
So there you go.

00:21:15.363 --> 00:21:17.030
Just like the one on
here, which I think

00:21:17.030 --> 00:21:18.060
is for a different mass number.

00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:18.560
Yep.

00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:19.430
102.

00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:22.810
We get the same kind of behavior
where things will mostly

00:21:22.810 --> 00:21:26.930
follow the lower mass parabola,
but sometimes if something

00:21:26.930 --> 00:21:32.110
gets stuck here, it can go
either way to get more stable.

00:21:32.110 --> 00:21:33.670
So I want to stop
here for new stuff,

00:21:33.670 --> 00:21:35.378
because this is
precisely where I thought

00:21:35.378 --> 00:21:36.675
we'd be at the end of the week.

00:21:36.675 --> 00:21:38.050
And in the next
half an hour, I'd

00:21:38.050 --> 00:21:40.420
like to open it up to
questions or working things

00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:42.520
out together on the
board or anything else

00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:43.440
you might have had.

00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:43.940
Yeah?

00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:46.150
AUDIENCE: I have a question
about the parabola things.

00:21:46.150 --> 00:21:46.817
PROFESSOR: Sure.

00:21:46.817 --> 00:21:50.480
AUDIENCE: There's-- you
said multiple paths,

00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:53.910
so it doesn't have to do the
little peak in the middle?

00:21:53.910 --> 00:21:56.850
Like, could it follow the
lower parabola or the upper,

00:21:56.850 --> 00:21:58.330
or does it have to jump over?

00:21:58.330 --> 00:22:01.090
PROFESSOR: It's going
to go in whatever

00:22:01.090 --> 00:22:02.230
way makes it more stable.

00:22:02.230 --> 00:22:04.147
So you're never going
to have a nucleus that's

00:22:04.147 --> 00:22:06.365
going to spontaneously
gain mass in order

00:22:06.365 --> 00:22:07.490
to get to a different path.

00:22:07.490 --> 00:22:10.720
You can only go down
on the mass axis.

00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:13.930
But let's say you happen to be
starting here at potassium-40.

00:22:13.930 --> 00:22:16.960
You can go down via either
mechanism to the next mass

00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:18.289
parabola down.

00:22:18.289 --> 00:22:21.223
AUDIENCE: But if you were
argon, you would go up.

00:22:21.223 --> 00:22:22.690
That's what you would do.

00:22:22.690 --> 00:22:23.690
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:22:23.690 --> 00:22:25.180
If you're at argon,
you're stuck.

00:22:25.180 --> 00:22:27.490
And in fact, if you
want to take a look,

00:22:27.490 --> 00:22:29.980
what do I mean
scientifically by "stuck"?

00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:31.810
I mean stable.

00:22:31.810 --> 00:22:35.380
Argon-40 is a
stable nucleus that

00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:38.900
comprises 99.6% of the argon.

00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:41.710
So that's what I mean
by "stuck" is stable.

00:22:41.710 --> 00:22:44.110
And if we look at the rest
of the table of nuclides

00:22:44.110 --> 00:22:46.750
for similar-looking places--

00:22:46.750 --> 00:22:51.810
so let's hunt near potassium-40.

00:22:51.810 --> 00:22:53.410
So notice potassium-40
right here

00:22:53.410 --> 00:22:57.775
has got stable isotopes to the
upper left and the lower right.

00:22:57.775 --> 00:23:01.760
If we look back over
here, manganese-54.

00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:02.300
Same deal.

00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:05.330
It's got a stable isotope to
the upper left and a stable one

00:23:05.330 --> 00:23:07.010
to the lower right.

00:23:07.010 --> 00:23:09.740
How much you want to bet that
when we click on manganese-54,

00:23:09.740 --> 00:23:11.960
it's got two possible
parent nuclides--

00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:15.510
or I'm sorry, two
possible decay methods.

00:23:15.510 --> 00:23:17.360
So let's take a look.

00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:23.750
Manganese-54 can either electron
capture and positron decay

00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:27.668
to chromium-54 or
beta decay to iron-54.

00:23:27.668 --> 00:23:29.960
Let's take a look at one more
to hammer the point home,

00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:32.270
and I think that'll
probably be enough.

00:23:32.270 --> 00:23:36.160
Cobalt-58 right near
nickel-58 and iron-58.

00:23:39.530 --> 00:23:41.020
Interesting.

00:23:41.020 --> 00:23:44.902
That one's not allowed unless
there's more down here.

00:23:44.902 --> 00:23:46.920
So you can electron
capture to iron-58,

00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:50.130
but there's no
allowed decay to--

00:23:50.130 --> 00:23:51.510
what was it?

00:23:51.510 --> 00:23:52.950
Nickel-58.

00:23:52.950 --> 00:23:55.250
OK.

00:23:55.250 --> 00:23:56.960
Let's look for more.

00:23:56.960 --> 00:24:03.200
Chlorine-36 has argon and
sulfur on either side.

00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:05.890
There it is.

00:24:05.890 --> 00:24:07.353
Beta decay and electron capture.

00:24:07.353 --> 00:24:09.520
And how much you want to
bet there's basically never

00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:11.290
a positron here?

00:24:11.290 --> 00:24:15.210
But basically, not
actually never.

00:24:15.210 --> 00:24:19.110
So you get a positron 0.01%
of the time and electron

00:24:19.110 --> 00:24:21.510
capture 1.89% of the time.

00:24:21.510 --> 00:24:25.540
Where is the other
98-and-change percent?

00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:28.710
Right here in the beta decay.

00:24:28.710 --> 00:24:32.460
So in this case, chlorine-36
will preferentially beta decay.

00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:34.510
If you also notice, it's a--

00:24:34.510 --> 00:24:35.010
let's see.

00:24:35.010 --> 00:24:36.710
I don't know if that
actually matters.

00:24:36.710 --> 00:24:38.918
But I am going to say it's
more likely to beta decay.

00:24:38.918 --> 00:24:40.710
So when you sum
these up, you get

00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:43.590
100% of the possible decays.

00:24:43.590 --> 00:24:47.210
Let's see how many energy
levels there are there too.

00:24:47.210 --> 00:24:49.670
Hopefully not too many.

00:24:49.670 --> 00:24:51.980
That qualifies as not too many.

00:24:51.980 --> 00:24:52.480
Yeah?

00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:53.684
Sean?

00:24:53.684 --> 00:24:57.530
AUDIENCE: Are the changes
in mass always going

00:24:57.530 --> 00:25:01.520
to be attributed to
beta decays or electron

00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:03.960
captures or positron
[INAUDIBLE]??

00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:05.710
PROFESSOR: They'll be
due to those as well

00:25:05.710 --> 00:25:08.615
as some other processes, which
we're going to cover on decay.

00:25:08.615 --> 00:25:10.240
But if you notice,
I've been giving you

00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:12.730
a lot of flash-forwards
in this class.

00:25:12.730 --> 00:25:15.540
We've introduced
cross-sections as a thing,

00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:17.937
the proportionality
constant between interaction

00:25:17.937 --> 00:25:18.520
probabilities.

00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:20.260
We're going to hit
them hard later.

00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:22.510
I've also been kind of
introducing or flash-forwarding

00:25:22.510 --> 00:25:24.070
different methods of decay.

00:25:24.070 --> 00:25:26.020
So there's also alpha decay.

00:25:26.020 --> 00:25:29.470
There's also isomeric
transition or gamma emission.

00:25:29.470 --> 00:25:32.230
There's also
spontaneous fission.

00:25:32.230 --> 00:25:33.790
This is the whole
basis behind how

00:25:33.790 --> 00:25:35.650
fission can get working
without some sort

00:25:35.650 --> 00:25:37.280
of kick-starting element.

00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:40.050
So maybe now's a good
time to show you.

00:25:40.050 --> 00:25:47.030
Let's go to uranium-235
and see how it decays.

00:25:47.030 --> 00:25:51.740
It goes alpha decay to
thorium-231 most of the time.

00:25:51.740 --> 00:25:55.340
And if you look how,
it's not terrible.

00:25:55.340 --> 00:25:56.480
We can make sense of this.

00:25:58.990 --> 00:26:04.000
It also undergoes SF, which
stands for spontaneous fission.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:08.130
So one out of every seven--

00:26:08.130 --> 00:26:09.010
what is it?

00:26:09.010 --> 00:26:12.550
Seven out of every
billion times,

00:26:12.550 --> 00:26:16.540
it will just spontaneously
fizz into two fission products.

00:26:16.540 --> 00:26:19.540
And this is why if you put
enough uranium-235 together

00:26:19.540 --> 00:26:22.780
in one place, you can
make a critical reactor.

00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:24.280
In reality, you
don't tend to want

00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:29.560
to put enough U-235 together to
just spontaneously go critical.

00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:32.740
We use other isotopes
as kickstarters.

00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:35.770
For example, californium,
I think it's 252.

00:26:35.770 --> 00:26:36.910
Let's take a quick look.

00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:40.520
There we go.

00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:44.310
Californium-252 undergoes
spontaneous fission 3%

00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:44.810
of the time.

00:26:44.810 --> 00:26:47.730
It's even heavier,
even more unstable.

00:26:47.730 --> 00:26:49.850
So there is a
reactor called HFIR,

00:26:49.850 --> 00:26:53.210
or the high flux isotope reactor
at Oak Ridge National Lab.

00:26:53.210 --> 00:26:55.850
One of its main outputs is
californium kickstarters

00:26:55.850 --> 00:26:56.950
for reactors.

00:26:56.950 --> 00:26:59.930
So to get things going, you
put a little bit of californium

00:26:59.930 --> 00:27:02.930
in as a gigantic neutron source,
and then you don't really

00:27:02.930 --> 00:27:04.787
need it anymore
once it gets going.

00:27:04.787 --> 00:27:06.620
So it's one of the safer
ways of starting up

00:27:06.620 --> 00:27:09.470
a reactor is put in a
crazy neutron source,

00:27:09.470 --> 00:27:12.150
and then once it gets going,
take it out or leave it in

00:27:12.150 --> 00:27:12.650
and burn it.

00:27:12.650 --> 00:27:14.410
I'm not actually sure
which one they do.

00:27:14.410 --> 00:27:14.988
Yep?

00:27:14.988 --> 00:27:16.482
AUDIENCE: Is the
name californium

00:27:16.482 --> 00:27:18.480
based on California?

00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:19.753
PROFESSOR: It is.

00:27:19.753 --> 00:27:20.420
When we get to--

00:27:20.420 --> 00:27:22.753
now is a good time to introduce
the super heavy elements

00:27:22.753 --> 00:27:24.000
since you asked.

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:27.150
So a lot of these older
elements were named after--

00:27:27.150 --> 00:27:28.940
actually this is kind
of a hobby of mine.

00:27:28.940 --> 00:27:32.490
So I don't know if you guys
saw the periodic table outside.

00:27:32.490 --> 00:27:34.098
I collect elements,
because if you're

00:27:34.098 --> 00:27:35.640
going to collect
something, you might

00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:39.280
as well collect everything that
everything else is made of.

00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:41.670
It's the same reason I
went into nuclear energy.

00:27:41.670 --> 00:27:45.210
I started off course 6, or
6.1, specifically electrical.

00:27:45.210 --> 00:27:47.430
And I was like, well, I
could be designing, like,

00:27:47.430 --> 00:27:49.270
the next screen
for a cell phone,

00:27:49.270 --> 00:27:51.218
or we could solve
the energy problem,

00:27:51.218 --> 00:27:53.260
which is the problem all
others are based off of.

00:27:53.260 --> 00:27:55.770
So my whole life theme
has been go to the source.

00:27:55.770 --> 00:27:58.620
That's why I came here in
high school and never left.

00:27:58.620 --> 00:28:00.540
That's why I declared course 22.

00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:03.060
That's why I collect
elements and probably is

00:28:03.060 --> 00:28:05.940
the reason for many other things
which only a psychiatrist could

00:28:05.940 --> 00:28:08.460
diagnose.

00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:10.860
But let's look at some
of the other elements.

00:28:10.860 --> 00:28:14.040
For example, yttrium.

00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:16.480
I think it has a isotope 40.

00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:19.170
Anyone know-- no, it
doesn't have a 40.

00:28:19.170 --> 00:28:20.935
What about a 50?

00:28:20.935 --> 00:28:21.435
60?

00:28:23.950 --> 00:28:25.520
100?

00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:26.900
Whatever.

00:28:26.900 --> 00:28:28.850
At least it knew
that Y was yttrium.

00:28:28.850 --> 00:28:29.540
Anyone know--

00:28:29.540 --> 00:28:30.082
AUDIENCE: 89.

00:28:30.082 --> 00:28:31.707
PROFESSOR: --where
this is coming from?

00:28:31.707 --> 00:28:32.870
89?

00:28:32.870 --> 00:28:33.605
Seems high.

00:28:36.430 --> 00:28:36.930
Oh my god.

00:28:36.930 --> 00:28:37.472
You're right.

00:28:37.472 --> 00:28:38.560
AUDIENCE: I work with it.

00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:39.700
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:28:39.700 --> 00:28:40.200
Gotcha.

00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:41.640
You work with it.

00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:42.180
Awesome.

00:28:42.180 --> 00:28:44.958
Anyone know what this
is all about, yttrium?

00:28:48.030 --> 00:28:50.510
There's a town called
Ytterby in Sweden

00:28:50.510 --> 00:28:53.720
where large deposits of
yttrium and ytterbium, or Yb,

00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:57.730
tend to be found or
Db, named for dubnium.

00:28:57.730 --> 00:28:59.600
So let's say the really
basic elements tend

00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:00.530
to come from Latin.

00:29:00.530 --> 00:29:03.730
Fe stands for iron, which
actually stands for ferrum.

00:29:03.730 --> 00:29:04.700
Lead is plumbum.

00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:06.140
Gold is aurum.

00:29:06.140 --> 00:29:07.707
Silver, Ag, is argentium.

00:29:07.707 --> 00:29:09.290
I don't know if I'm
saying that right.

00:29:09.290 --> 00:29:10.707
I never took Latin,
and I've never

00:29:10.707 --> 00:29:13.402
heard it spoken, of course.

00:29:13.402 --> 00:29:15.860
And then a lot of the heavier
and heavier elements as we go

00:29:15.860 --> 00:29:17.527
are being named for
more and more famous

00:29:17.527 --> 00:29:21.860
scientists or places where
they tend to be made like Db.

00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:24.260
I'm going to guess
260 for a mass there.

00:29:24.260 --> 00:29:25.700
Oh, nice.

00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:28.730
For Dubna in Russia
that has got one

00:29:28.730 --> 00:29:32.690
of the few gigantic super heavy
element colliders where they're

00:29:32.690 --> 00:29:35.585
constantly synthesizing
and characterizing

00:29:35.585 --> 00:29:36.710
these super heavy elements.

00:29:36.710 --> 00:29:38.247
So finally they
said, you know what?

00:29:38.247 --> 00:29:39.830
They've made enough
of these in Dubna.

00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:41.840
Let's name one of the
elements after them.

00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:44.690
Or Sg, seaborgium,
for Glenn Seaborg.

00:29:44.690 --> 00:29:48.920
Or No, nobelium,
for Alfred Nobel.

00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:50.538
Yep?

00:29:50.538 --> 00:29:53.740
AUDIENCE: I just have a question
for the actual mass parabola.

00:29:53.740 --> 00:29:54.490
PROFESSOR: Uh-huh.

00:29:57.412 --> 00:30:03.142
AUDIENCE: Like, do the parabolas
ever, like, reach each other?

00:30:03.142 --> 00:30:04.350
PROFESSOR: Do they intersect?

00:30:04.350 --> 00:30:04.980
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:30:04.980 --> 00:30:07.350
PROFESSOR: I've never seen
a case where they intersect.

00:30:07.350 --> 00:30:10.440
That would make for a
crazy situation indeed.

00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:13.050
However, part of what the
homework assignment's about

00:30:13.050 --> 00:30:16.710
is to derive an analytical
form for a mass parabola

00:30:16.710 --> 00:30:19.360
and then check the data
to see how well it works.

00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:22.710
So for any cases where you
have an even mass number,

00:30:22.710 --> 00:30:26.130
and you have either odd-odd
or even-even nuclei,

00:30:26.130 --> 00:30:28.260
you can check those
equations analytically

00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:30.547
to see if they'll intersect.

00:30:30.547 --> 00:30:33.956
AUDIENCE: And for the
case of A equals 40,

00:30:33.956 --> 00:30:38.350
I'm not really sure what
the top parabola is.

00:30:38.350 --> 00:30:40.410
PROFESSOR: So the top
parabola for potassium-40--

00:30:40.410 --> 00:30:44.160
let's take a quick look at how
many protons and neutrons it

00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:45.330
has.

00:30:45.330 --> 00:30:48.720
Potassium has a proton
number of 19, which means

00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:50.820
it has a neutron number of 21.

00:30:50.820 --> 00:30:57.430
So the top parabola
is odd N and odd Z,

00:30:57.430 --> 00:31:05.040
where the bottom one
is even N and even Z.

00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:07.140
Whereas for odd
mass number nuclei,

00:31:07.140 --> 00:31:10.560
it has to be either
odd-even or even-odd,

00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:13.440
else it would be even, which
is a funny sentence when

00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:15.170
you say it all out loud.

00:31:15.170 --> 00:31:15.670
Yeah.

00:31:15.670 --> 00:31:17.770
So that's the idea
here is that notice

00:31:17.770 --> 00:31:22.330
that the even-even parabola
tends to be further down.

00:31:22.330 --> 00:31:26.920
All those nuclear magic
numbers, 2, 8, 20, 28--

00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:28.340
I'm not going to quote the rest.

00:31:28.340 --> 00:31:29.860
Those the little ones I know.

00:31:29.860 --> 00:31:32.570
All even numbers.

00:31:32.570 --> 00:31:34.070
So any other questions
on these mass

00:31:34.070 --> 00:31:36.300
parabolas before we launch
into super heavy elements?

00:31:36.300 --> 00:31:36.800
Yeah?

00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:38.830
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
the bump on the right?

00:31:38.830 --> 00:31:39.580
PROFESSOR: Uh-huh.

00:31:39.580 --> 00:31:42.606
AUDIENCE: How do you know
that that's where [INAUDIBLE]??

00:31:45.270 --> 00:31:47.150
PROFESSOR: Analytically
or experimentally?

00:31:47.150 --> 00:31:47.775
Which question?

00:31:47.775 --> 00:31:49.530
AUDIENCE: Analytically.

00:31:49.530 --> 00:31:50.970
PROFESSOR: So analytically.

00:31:50.970 --> 00:31:54.780
Analytically there
should be some isotope

00:31:54.780 --> 00:31:56.370
of-- well, not potassium.

00:31:56.370 --> 00:31:57.460
That wouldn't be allowed.

00:31:57.460 --> 00:32:01.530
So in this case, the
stable element positions

00:32:01.530 --> 00:32:04.330
have got to kind of switch
off, shouldn't they?

00:32:04.330 --> 00:32:08.430
So if that's potassium-40,
that would still

00:32:08.430 --> 00:32:10.898
have to be potassium.

00:32:10.898 --> 00:32:12.440
You don't really
have another choice.

00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:15.655
There isn't really a position
there, is there, analytically?

00:32:15.655 --> 00:32:17.780
That's the interesting
thing is that you can either

00:32:17.780 --> 00:32:21.830
be odd-odd or even-even
for an even mass number.

00:32:21.830 --> 00:32:25.880
But you can't just take off
one neutron from potassium-40,

00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:27.430
and then you've
got potassium-39.

00:32:27.430 --> 00:32:30.110
Then you're on a
different mass number.

00:32:30.110 --> 00:32:32.810
Or if you exchange a
proton and a neutron,

00:32:32.810 --> 00:32:35.340
which you pretty much do in
either of these directions.

00:32:35.340 --> 00:32:38.363
There's no way to get
straight down here.

00:32:38.363 --> 00:32:39.113
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:32:39.113 --> 00:32:39.780
PROFESSOR: Yeah?

00:32:39.780 --> 00:32:42.230
AUDIENCE: For odd-odd,
delta is negative, right?

00:32:42.230 --> 00:32:43.230
PROFESSOR: For odd what?

00:32:43.230 --> 00:32:43.850
For-- sorry?

00:32:43.850 --> 00:32:45.650
AUDIENCE: For odd-odd,
delta is negative?

00:32:45.650 --> 00:32:47.483
PROFESSOR: Yeah, let's
go back to that slide

00:32:47.483 --> 00:32:49.520
just to make sure.

00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:52.470
You mean the pairing term in
the semi-empirical mass formula?

00:32:52.470 --> 00:32:53.115
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:32:53.115 --> 00:32:54.740
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so
for odd-odd nuclei,

00:32:54.740 --> 00:32:58.580
indeed, delta's negative, which
means lower binding energy,

00:32:58.580 --> 00:32:59.720
which means higher mass.

00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:03.260
And that's why we see it bump
up on the mass right here.

00:33:03.260 --> 00:33:05.393
Yeah?

00:33:05.393 --> 00:33:07.310
And do you have a second
part of the question?

00:33:10.286 --> 00:33:14.750
AUDIENCE: It was
more so how to relate

00:33:14.750 --> 00:33:20.932
[INAUDIBLE] like the binding
energy to that mass parabola.

00:33:20.932 --> 00:33:22.390
PROFESSOR: We can
actually relate--

00:33:22.390 --> 00:33:23.848
so we can relate
the binding energy

00:33:23.848 --> 00:33:27.130
to the mass and the mass
parabola analytically,

00:33:27.130 --> 00:33:35.080
because the binding energy is
equal to Z times protons plus N

00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:40.420
times mass of neutron
minus the actual mass

00:33:40.420 --> 00:33:45.920
of that same nucleus, A comma
Z. So they're actually directly

00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:48.740
related, just negatively.

00:33:48.740 --> 00:33:50.720
So something with
a higher mass is

00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:53.300
going to have a low binding
energy, which means it's

00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:56.030
less bound and less stable.

00:33:56.030 --> 00:34:00.180
And indeed, the further
up the mass scale we go,

00:34:00.180 --> 00:34:02.690
the higher those
beta or electron

00:34:02.690 --> 00:34:04.757
capture or positron
energies are.

00:34:04.757 --> 00:34:06.590
And there's another
thing you can check too,

00:34:06.590 --> 00:34:08.150
which is the half-life.

00:34:08.150 --> 00:34:10.760
Half-life is what we'll be
talking about on Tuesday.

00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:14.000
It's how long before an
average amount of a substance

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:16.125
has undergone radioactive decay.

00:34:16.125 --> 00:34:17.750
So let's look at some
of these isotopes

00:34:17.750 --> 00:34:19.790
and start looking
at half-life trends

00:34:19.790 --> 00:34:21.980
as another measure of stability.

00:34:21.980 --> 00:34:26.900
So potassium-40 has an
exceptionally long half-life.

00:34:26.900 --> 00:34:29.330
So it's relatively stable.

00:34:29.330 --> 00:34:31.820
Let's take a look not at
either the stable isotopes,

00:34:31.820 --> 00:34:33.530
but let's go up
the mass parabola

00:34:33.530 --> 00:34:34.940
chain in one direction.

00:34:34.940 --> 00:34:38.300
Calcium-40, scandium-40.

00:34:38.300 --> 00:34:42.050
So let's take a
look at scandium-40.

00:34:42.050 --> 00:34:47.659
Scandium-40 has a half-life
less than a second.

00:34:47.659 --> 00:34:51.889
And it's got quite a high
decay energy by whatever method

00:34:51.889 --> 00:34:53.840
you want to use.

00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:56.555
Let's go up to titanium-40.

00:34:56.555 --> 00:34:57.430
Anyone want to guess?

00:34:57.430 --> 00:35:01.400
Do you think the half-life
is going to go up or down?

00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:03.460
Let's see if the
half-life goes down.

00:35:03.460 --> 00:35:07.610
We know the decay
energy goes up.

00:35:07.610 --> 00:35:08.420
Indeed.

00:35:08.420 --> 00:35:11.390
Half-life goes down from
182 milliseconds to 50

00:35:11.390 --> 00:35:13.040
milliseconds.

00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:17.250
And let's say titanium-40
could have come from-- wow.

00:35:17.250 --> 00:35:23.770
Two proton decay from Cr-42 with
a half-life of 350 nanoseconds.

00:35:23.770 --> 00:35:28.680
So as we go up the mass ladder
and down the stability ladder,

00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:32.940
the half-life decreases, which
kind of follows intuitively.

00:35:32.940 --> 00:35:34.560
Something that's
exceptionally stable

00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:36.548
should have a
half-life of infinity,

00:35:36.548 --> 00:35:38.340
and something that's
exceptionally unstable

00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:40.345
should just blow
apart instantly.

00:35:40.345 --> 00:35:41.970
Like, remember the
first week of class,

00:35:41.970 --> 00:35:45.600
we talked about helium-4
grabbing a neutron,

00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:48.420
becoming helium-5, and
instantaneously going back

00:35:48.420 --> 00:35:50.200
to helium-4.

00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:55.630
If you look at
helium-5, its half-life

00:35:55.630 --> 00:36:00.970
is measured in MeV, or 7 times
10 to the minus 7 femtoseconds.

00:36:00.970 --> 00:36:03.100
So if helium-4
absorbs a neutron,

00:36:03.100 --> 00:36:05.830
it simply doesn't want
it and gets rid of it

00:36:05.830 --> 00:36:09.790
in 10 to the minus 7
femtoseconds, which

00:36:09.790 --> 00:36:11.785
would tell us that it's
exceptionally unstable.

00:36:15.358 --> 00:36:16.900
So I hope that's a
long-winded answer

00:36:16.900 --> 00:36:20.170
to that question about what
does it mean to be going up

00:36:20.170 --> 00:36:23.250
in the mass levels.

00:36:23.250 --> 00:36:25.890
Any other questions on mass
parabolas or the liquid drop

00:36:25.890 --> 00:36:29.320
model or stability in general?

00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:30.100
Yes.

00:36:30.100 --> 00:36:33.012
AUDIENCE: For something that
goes upwards [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:33.012 --> 00:36:35.377
just because the
mass [INAUDIBLE]..

00:36:38.627 --> 00:36:40.460
PROFESSOR: So if you're
changing one neutron

00:36:40.460 --> 00:36:43.820
to a proton in each case,
you're switching back and forth

00:36:43.820 --> 00:36:47.630
from the odd-odd to the
even-even mass parabolas.

00:36:47.630 --> 00:36:50.690
So if I were to redraw
these dots more to scale,

00:36:50.690 --> 00:36:54.800
this would have to
be on the odd-odd.

00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:58.400
And, well, let me draw
them a little better.

00:36:58.400 --> 00:36:59.090
Yep.

00:36:59.090 --> 00:37:00.050
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:37:00.050 --> 00:37:02.330
PROFESSOR: That's
on the odd-odd,

00:37:02.330 --> 00:37:03.810
and that's on the even-even.

00:37:03.810 --> 00:37:04.770
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:37:04.770 --> 00:37:05.600
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:07.460
So excuse my poor
drawing skills.

00:37:07.460 --> 00:37:10.340
But if you're switching
one proton to a neutron

00:37:10.340 --> 00:37:13.370
or vice-versa, by
definition, you're

00:37:13.370 --> 00:37:17.330
jumping back and forth
between these parabolas.

00:37:17.330 --> 00:37:18.330
AUDIENCE: OK, thank you.

00:37:18.330 --> 00:37:20.497
PROFESSOR: That's a good
question for clarification.

00:37:20.497 --> 00:37:21.530
You had a question too?

00:37:21.530 --> 00:37:24.635
AUDIENCE: Yeah, about the
semi-empirical mass formula.

00:37:24.635 --> 00:37:28.112
When do you use that to find
binding energy as opposed

00:37:28.112 --> 00:37:29.445
to, like, any of the other ways?

00:37:31.785 --> 00:37:32.660
PROFESSOR: I'm sorry.

00:37:32.660 --> 00:37:34.550
The semi-empirical mass
formula is a good way

00:37:34.550 --> 00:37:37.880
to get an analytical
guess at most of them.

00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:39.680
If you want an
exact answer, always

00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:41.420
use the actual binding energy.

00:37:41.420 --> 00:37:45.890
AUDIENCE: So, like, how
often is it used now?

00:37:45.890 --> 00:37:48.758
PROFESSOR: I would not say
it's used much now except--

00:37:48.758 --> 00:37:51.050
well, that's going to be one
of your homework questions

00:37:51.050 --> 00:37:55.460
is this formula predicts that
as you get heavier and heavier

00:37:55.460 --> 00:37:59.720
and heavier, nuclei should just
continuously get less stable.

00:37:59.720 --> 00:38:02.180
And that was, as of
when this was derived,

00:38:02.180 --> 00:38:06.410
let's say decades ago, we
now know something different

00:38:06.410 --> 00:38:07.683
is happening.

00:38:07.683 --> 00:38:09.350
So if you look at the
table of nuclides,

00:38:09.350 --> 00:38:13.580
you can sort of see some swells
in the number of black pixels

00:38:13.580 --> 00:38:15.350
until it cuts off.

00:38:15.350 --> 00:38:18.320
And this region actually where
we think super heavy elements

00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:22.160
happen, I want to jump to the
actual table of nuclides, which

00:38:22.160 --> 00:38:26.180
I'll say is our snapshot
of knowledge today,

00:38:26.180 --> 00:38:29.210
and go all the way to the top.

00:38:29.210 --> 00:38:33.530
And our knowledge kind of cuts
off at these elements, which

00:38:33.530 --> 00:38:38.030
are, for now, temporarily
named in a very uncreative way.

00:38:38.030 --> 00:38:40.260
We don't even know
anything about them.

00:38:40.260 --> 00:38:43.430
Uun is probably going to
have a proton number of what?

00:38:43.430 --> 00:38:45.620
110.

00:38:45.620 --> 00:38:47.330
I don't know what
the prefixes are,

00:38:47.330 --> 00:38:50.150
but UUU would be un-un-un 111.

00:38:50.150 --> 00:38:54.010
Probably has 111 protons.

00:38:54.010 --> 00:38:58.540
Beyond here, off the screen or
probably up into the next room,

00:38:58.540 --> 00:39:02.110
it's predicted that once you
approach the next magic number

00:39:02.110 --> 00:39:05.110
in nuclei, there should
be an island of stability

00:39:05.110 --> 00:39:07.847
where it may not necessarily
be totally stable,

00:39:07.847 --> 00:39:09.430
but the half-lives
should go up again.

00:39:09.430 --> 00:39:12.160
And we should be able to
synthesize super heavy matter.

00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:14.400
And if you actually
graph neutron number

00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:17.260
versus half-life-- so notice
how we were looking at half-life

00:39:17.260 --> 00:39:19.000
as a measure of stability.

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:21.730
It starts to go up, then
comes down, and then,

00:39:21.730 --> 00:39:23.590
to the extent of
our knowledge, it

00:39:23.590 --> 00:39:27.400
is going back up again to the
next predicted magic number.

00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:29.530
So what we think
should be happening

00:39:29.530 --> 00:39:31.820
is half-lives should be
continuously going up.

00:39:31.820 --> 00:39:32.320
And yeah?

00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:33.112
You had a question?

00:39:33.112 --> 00:39:35.960
AUDIENCE: Like, what do we
do with these weird things?

00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:37.570
PROFESSOR: Well,
whatever you want.

00:39:37.570 --> 00:39:39.520
It's going to be--

00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:42.850
it should be dense as all heck,
because nuclear matter is quite

00:39:42.850 --> 00:39:44.290
a bit denser than
ordinary matter,

00:39:44.290 --> 00:39:47.030
and quite a bit is
quite an understatement.

00:39:47.030 --> 00:39:49.450
So what would you do
with super heavy matter?

00:39:49.450 --> 00:39:52.150
A lot of it could be used to
probe the structure of matter.

00:39:52.150 --> 00:39:54.100
There's a lot about
how the nucleus is

00:39:54.100 --> 00:39:56.410
constructed that we don't know.

00:39:56.410 --> 00:39:57.940
And beyond the
scope of this course

00:39:57.940 --> 00:39:59.732
would also be an understatement.

00:39:59.732 --> 00:40:01.690
There's folks that are
making their careers now

00:40:01.690 --> 00:40:04.570
on figuring out what are
the forces between nucleons?

00:40:04.570 --> 00:40:08.440
Why do things spontaneously
fizz at the rates that they do?

00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:11.230
You'll even hit a little
bit of this in 22.02

00:40:11.230 --> 00:40:14.740
when you can calculate the rough
half-life for alpha decay using

00:40:14.740 --> 00:40:20.480
quantum tunneling through the
potential barrier in a nucleus.

00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:22.750
And so the more nuclei we
have to mess around with,

00:40:22.750 --> 00:40:25.540
the more data and real
examples we have to study.

00:40:25.540 --> 00:40:28.390
But practical applications,
well, I could imagine,

00:40:28.390 --> 00:40:30.830
we might find something
denser than osmium.

00:40:30.830 --> 00:40:33.910
Osmium right now has a
density of about 22 grams

00:40:33.910 --> 00:40:35.390
per cubic centimeter.

00:40:35.390 --> 00:40:38.740
This stuff, zirconium,
is about 6.9 or so.

00:40:38.740 --> 00:40:40.030
Steel is like 8.

00:40:40.030 --> 00:40:41.140
Lead's like 11.

00:40:41.140 --> 00:40:42.700
Mercury is like 19.

00:40:42.700 --> 00:40:46.900
Have any of you ever played
with liquid mercury before?

00:40:46.900 --> 00:40:49.510
This is a "don't try this at
home, kids" kind of moment.

00:40:49.510 --> 00:40:51.190
My grandfather happened
to be a dentist,

00:40:51.190 --> 00:40:54.110
so we happened to have a lot
of mercury to mess around with.

00:40:54.110 --> 00:40:56.170
And it's, like,
unintuitively heavy.

00:40:56.170 --> 00:40:57.250
It's unbelievable.

00:40:57.250 --> 00:40:59.810
A 1-pound jar is about that big.

00:40:59.810 --> 00:41:01.310
I think it would
be cool if we could

00:41:01.310 --> 00:41:04.710
find something even denser.

00:41:04.710 --> 00:41:06.300
And then really,
really dense matter

00:41:06.300 --> 00:41:09.390
happens to make really, really
good photon shields and gamma--

00:41:09.390 --> 00:41:10.390
not the Star Trek thing.

00:41:10.390 --> 00:41:13.410
I mean this in the actual
nuclear physics sense.

00:41:13.410 --> 00:41:16.260
The best way to stop gamma
rays for gamma shielding

00:41:16.260 --> 00:41:18.420
is just put more
matter in front of it.

00:41:18.420 --> 00:41:22.290
And if we find a denser state
of matter that's earth stable,

00:41:22.290 --> 00:41:25.493
you then have a
smaller gamma shield.

00:41:25.493 --> 00:41:27.660
So there are practical
applications too in radiation

00:41:27.660 --> 00:41:28.560
shielding.

00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:30.863
They also might make
awesome nuclear fuel,

00:41:30.863 --> 00:41:32.280
because you better
believe they're

00:41:32.280 --> 00:41:35.110
going to fizz like crazy.

00:41:35.110 --> 00:41:35.830
So who knows?

00:41:35.830 --> 00:41:39.130
Maybe we can-- I don't think
that would be cost-effective,

00:41:39.130 --> 00:41:41.050
but it would probably work.

00:41:41.050 --> 00:41:44.290
So the way they're
doing this is actually

00:41:44.290 --> 00:41:50.320
slamming calcium 48 nuclei
into other super heavy elements

00:41:50.320 --> 00:41:52.730
that have exceptionally
long half-lives.

00:41:52.730 --> 00:41:54.640
So if you can't read
what the screen says,

00:41:54.640 --> 00:41:57.820
this here is berkelium,
for Berkeley,

00:41:57.820 --> 00:42:01.600
with proton number
97, mass number 249.

00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:08.450
Let's take a look at the
Bk-249, which happens

00:42:08.450 --> 00:42:10.020
to be way beyond uranium.

00:42:10.020 --> 00:42:12.710
So it's definitely
not a stable isotope,

00:42:12.710 --> 00:42:15.890
but it has a
half-life of 320 days.

00:42:15.890 --> 00:42:17.720
That means you can
make a bunch of it,

00:42:17.720 --> 00:42:20.840
chemically separate it,
make it into a target,

00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:24.110
and fire calcium-48
nuclei into it.

00:42:24.110 --> 00:42:27.680
Anyone want to guess,
why do we use calcium-48?

00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:30.525
And I'll give you a hint
and write the proton number

00:42:30.525 --> 00:42:31.025
for calcium.

00:42:33.550 --> 00:42:40.230
The isotope that we
use is calcium-28--

00:42:40.230 --> 00:42:42.090
or calcium-48.

00:42:42.090 --> 00:42:43.830
Anyone want to take a guess?

00:42:43.830 --> 00:42:45.970
Why start here?

00:42:45.970 --> 00:42:48.570
Why not just smash two
berkeliums into each other?

00:42:51.690 --> 00:42:56.130
Calcium 48 happens to
be exceptionally stable,

00:42:56.130 --> 00:42:57.930
because it's got
two magic numbers.

00:42:57.930 --> 00:43:01.560
Its proton number is 20, one
of those peaks of stability.

00:43:01.560 --> 00:43:04.200
And its neutron number is 28.

00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:07.200
So start with
something super stable,

00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:10.290
something with a lot more
binding energy to begin with,

00:43:10.290 --> 00:43:12.600
and you maximize your
chance of making something

00:43:12.600 --> 00:43:15.210
with more binding energy
that won't just spontaneously

00:43:15.210 --> 00:43:16.110
disappear.

00:43:16.110 --> 00:43:18.630
So there are reasons
calcium 48 was chosen

00:43:18.630 --> 00:43:20.475
and not something
heavier or lighter.

00:43:20.475 --> 00:43:22.050
If we go back to
that article, you

00:43:22.050 --> 00:43:25.650
can see what happens here is
you make some element 117, which

00:43:25.650 --> 00:43:30.300
has yet to be made, and it
undergoes alpha decay until it

00:43:30.300 --> 00:43:33.840
reaches some rather stable--

00:43:33.840 --> 00:43:35.580
you know, 17 seconds.

00:43:35.580 --> 00:43:37.080
That's pretty exceptional.

00:43:37.080 --> 00:43:40.170
And if you notice the
trends here, as you decay,

00:43:40.170 --> 00:43:43.710
the alpha energy
steadily goes down,

00:43:43.710 --> 00:43:46.350
and the half-life
steadily goes up.

00:43:46.350 --> 00:43:49.560
And so what you do is you make
a super, super heavy element,

00:43:49.560 --> 00:43:51.930
hoping that it
will decay and rest

00:43:51.930 --> 00:43:54.210
in one of these
islands of stability

00:43:54.210 --> 00:43:58.630
beyond the magic numbers
that we know right now.

00:43:58.630 --> 00:44:00.130
Which I thought
this was super cool,

00:44:00.130 --> 00:44:02.203
because this is
actually happening now.

00:44:02.203 --> 00:44:03.370
Like, new elements are made.

00:44:03.370 --> 00:44:05.200
I think we've been
seeing one a year

00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:06.867
or so for the past
few years on average.

00:44:06.867 --> 00:44:09.242
There might have been a year
when there was more than one

00:44:09.242 --> 00:44:10.437
announced recently.

00:44:10.437 --> 00:44:12.520
There's only a few places
in the world doing them,

00:44:12.520 --> 00:44:15.430
but you can start to-- already
with two weeks of 22.01,

00:44:15.430 --> 00:44:17.650
you can start to
get a handle for why

00:44:17.650 --> 00:44:20.410
do they use the nuclei they do,
and then what sort of things

00:44:20.410 --> 00:44:21.790
are you looking for?

00:44:21.790 --> 00:44:24.040
Decays with lower
and lower energy

00:44:24.040 --> 00:44:27.590
mean you're already starting
to get less steep on whatever

00:44:27.590 --> 00:44:29.057
imaginary mass parabola.

00:44:29.057 --> 00:44:30.640
Don't quite know how
to draw this one,

00:44:30.640 --> 00:44:32.710
because it's beyond
anything we know.

00:44:32.710 --> 00:44:34.780
And as the half-lives
keep going up,

00:44:34.780 --> 00:44:39.350
you can tell that it's reaching
a measure of stability.

00:44:39.350 --> 00:44:41.750
However, to get you
started on the homework,

00:44:41.750 --> 00:44:43.453
for the open-ended
ended problem--

00:44:43.453 --> 00:44:44.870
I think I'll bring
it up right now

00:44:44.870 --> 00:44:46.037
so you guys can take a look.

00:44:48.812 --> 00:44:53.420
So let's go to the Stellar site.

00:45:00.802 --> 00:45:02.010
Hopefully it doesn't call me.

00:45:02.010 --> 00:45:02.510
Good.

00:45:07.530 --> 00:45:09.017
And two problem set two.

00:45:09.017 --> 00:45:10.600
This is the way I
know that everyone's

00:45:10.600 --> 00:45:13.100
seen the P set seven days before
it's due, because I'm going

00:45:13.100 --> 00:45:17.270
to put it up on the
screen so you can

00:45:17.270 --> 00:45:20.070
see it all the way at the end.

00:45:20.070 --> 00:45:23.710
Predicting the
island of stability.

00:45:23.710 --> 00:45:25.690
Does the semi-empirical
mass formula

00:45:25.690 --> 00:45:28.420
predict the island of stability?

00:45:28.420 --> 00:45:30.670
Well, let's start you
off with the easier

00:45:30.670 --> 00:45:32.500
part of the question,
which is yes or no.

00:45:32.500 --> 00:45:34.840
And I'm going to leave you
to the why and the how.

00:45:34.840 --> 00:45:41.050
If we graph binding energy per
nucleon versus mass number,

00:45:41.050 --> 00:45:48.050
the semi-empirical mass formula
predicts something like this.

00:45:48.050 --> 00:45:51.200
What happens as we go beyond
the realm of known mass numbers?

00:45:56.140 --> 00:45:56.640
Anyone?

00:45:56.640 --> 00:45:58.342
How should I extend this curve?

00:46:01.952 --> 00:46:02.910
What did you say, Alex?

00:46:02.910 --> 00:46:03.700
AUDIENCE: I don't know.

00:46:03.700 --> 00:46:04.825
PROFESSOR: Just keep going.

00:46:04.825 --> 00:46:06.330
Yeah.

00:46:06.330 --> 00:46:10.750
Does this predict an
island of stability?

00:46:10.750 --> 00:46:12.190
I don't think so.

00:46:12.190 --> 00:46:14.290
So that's one of the
few questions I'm

00:46:14.290 --> 00:46:15.970
asking you in this homework.

00:46:15.970 --> 00:46:17.320
And it's up to you guys.

00:46:17.320 --> 00:46:18.340
Use your creativity.

00:46:18.340 --> 00:46:20.020
Again, this is an
open-ended problem.

00:46:20.020 --> 00:46:22.330
I'm not looking for
a specific answer.

00:46:22.330 --> 00:46:24.220
I want to see how
you think and how

00:46:24.220 --> 00:46:27.130
you would change this
formula to account

00:46:27.130 --> 00:46:30.130
and actually predict the
island of stability while still

00:46:30.130 --> 00:46:33.550
satisfying the mostly correct
predictions from the elements

00:46:33.550 --> 00:46:36.330
we know.

00:46:36.330 --> 00:46:37.906
So-- sorry, go ahead.

00:46:37.906 --> 00:46:43.860
AUDIENCE: So should it,
like, converge a little bit?

00:46:43.860 --> 00:46:46.170
PROFESSOR: Well, you're
on the right track.

00:46:46.170 --> 00:46:47.670
If you want to show
stability, you'd

00:46:47.670 --> 00:46:51.300
want it to maybe have a
higher value right here.

00:46:51.300 --> 00:46:53.700
Higher binding
energy per nucleon

00:46:53.700 --> 00:46:56.460
would correspond to a
lower mass, which would

00:46:56.460 --> 00:46:58.560
correspond to higher stability.

00:46:58.560 --> 00:47:04.742
So how would you predict
this island of stability?

00:47:04.742 --> 00:47:06.450
And then more
specifically, how would you

00:47:06.450 --> 00:47:12.150
reconcile the inaccuracies
in the semi-empirical mass

00:47:12.150 --> 00:47:12.990
formula?

00:47:12.990 --> 00:47:15.463
Because we know it doesn't
work very well for all cases.

00:47:15.463 --> 00:47:17.880
There are some cases like right
around here where it works

00:47:17.880 --> 00:47:21.120
great, and there's some like
right here and right here where

00:47:21.120 --> 00:47:21.870
it really doesn't.

00:47:21.870 --> 00:47:24.390
You can get things
wrong by like 10 MeV,

00:47:24.390 --> 00:47:26.750
which is pretty significant.

00:47:26.750 --> 00:47:29.288
You know, that's like four
digits on the mass scale, like,

00:47:29.288 --> 00:47:30.330
the fourth decimal place.

00:47:30.330 --> 00:47:31.747
That's huge to a
nuclear engineer.

00:47:34.220 --> 00:47:36.260
So that's something
to get thinking about.

00:47:36.260 --> 00:47:38.300
And remember I did tell
you that there will

00:47:38.300 --> 00:47:40.220
be some open-ended problems.

00:47:40.220 --> 00:47:41.720
I'm going to mark
them as open-ended

00:47:41.720 --> 00:47:43.310
so you actually know.

00:47:43.310 --> 00:47:45.360
We're not looking for a
right or wrong answer.

00:47:45.360 --> 00:47:47.150
This is one of those
kinds of things

00:47:47.150 --> 00:47:49.130
where we want to
see how you think

00:47:49.130 --> 00:47:50.960
and what do you
think is missing.

00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:54.350
There's other hard problems
where we give you the answer,

00:47:54.350 --> 00:47:57.080
because I'm not interested
in you deriving some insane

00:47:57.080 --> 00:47:59.750
expression and getting it right.

00:47:59.750 --> 00:48:02.300
I'm interested in the
derivation process.

00:48:02.300 --> 00:48:04.070
What are the steps you choose?

00:48:04.070 --> 00:48:05.630
What sort of
assumptions do you make?

00:48:05.630 --> 00:48:08.120
What sort of terms can
you neglect and say,

00:48:08.120 --> 00:48:09.650
that's in the ninth
decimal place.

00:48:09.650 --> 00:48:11.223
I'm going to forget it.

00:48:11.223 --> 00:48:12.890
So in this case, we
give you the answer,

00:48:12.890 --> 00:48:15.740
because we're going to
grade you on the process.

00:48:15.740 --> 00:48:18.050
And you can use the answer
to check your process

00:48:18.050 --> 00:48:21.200
and see if you're on
the right track or not.

00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:24.520
For the skill-building
questions,

00:48:24.520 --> 00:48:25.990
we actually do
want you to come up

00:48:25.990 --> 00:48:29.400
with some sort of an
answer like explaining

00:48:29.400 --> 00:48:32.250
the terms in the
semi-empirical mass formula

00:48:32.250 --> 00:48:35.010
or modifying an equation to
calculate something else.

00:48:35.010 --> 00:48:37.150
We will be looking for
a right answer there.

00:48:37.150 --> 00:48:39.025
But those are questions
to make sure that you

00:48:39.025 --> 00:48:40.350
get the basics of the material.

00:48:40.350 --> 00:48:42.960
If you can answer all of the
questions in the first half

00:48:42.960 --> 00:48:45.990
of these P sets fairly quickly,
let's say in three or four

00:48:45.990 --> 00:48:48.810
hours, you're totally
on the right track.

00:48:48.810 --> 00:48:52.280
The hard ones is
because this is MIT.

00:48:52.280 --> 00:48:53.780
And we want you to
think beyond just

00:48:53.780 --> 00:48:56.360
knowing what's in the
Turner book or the Yit book.

00:48:56.360 --> 00:48:59.760
Like I said, you guys are
the leaders of this field.

00:48:59.760 --> 00:49:03.564
So any other questions
on stability in general?

00:49:03.564 --> 00:49:04.064
Yes?

00:49:04.064 --> 00:49:06.494
AUDIENCE: Just a
real quick reminder.

00:49:06.494 --> 00:49:08.230
When you say, like,
even-even, are you

00:49:08.230 --> 00:49:09.680
talking protons, neutrons?

00:49:09.680 --> 00:49:10.700
PROFESSOR: Correct.

00:49:10.700 --> 00:49:13.640
So that would be even
N and even Z or odd N

00:49:13.640 --> 00:49:15.350
and odd Z like in
the reading and like

00:49:15.350 --> 00:49:18.440
on these mass parabolas.

00:49:18.440 --> 00:49:18.940
Yep.

00:49:18.940 --> 00:49:20.410
Any other questions?

00:49:23.210 --> 00:49:23.710
Yes.

00:49:23.710 --> 00:49:25.990
AUDIENCE: Is the
only proof or reason

00:49:25.990 --> 00:49:28.126
that we say that there's
an island of stability

00:49:28.126 --> 00:49:33.637
because the mass increases
up to the point of unknown?

00:49:33.637 --> 00:49:34.720
PROFESSOR: There's a few--

00:49:34.720 --> 00:49:36.883
so the question was,
is the only reason

00:49:36.883 --> 00:49:39.550
people think there will be super
heavy elements because the mass

00:49:39.550 --> 00:49:40.360
increases, right?

00:49:40.360 --> 00:49:41.260
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:49:41.260 --> 00:49:44.350
PROFESSOR: So in this case,
the mass will always--

00:49:44.350 --> 00:49:47.150
are you talking about
now the total mass or--

00:49:47.150 --> 00:49:49.696
AUDIENCE: Why is
the idea that there

00:49:49.696 --> 00:49:51.317
is this island of stability?

00:49:51.317 --> 00:49:52.520
PROFESSOR: Ah, OK.

00:49:52.520 --> 00:49:53.978
AUDIENCE: If this
doesn't prove it,

00:49:53.978 --> 00:49:57.250
do we have other
reasons [INAUDIBLE]??

00:49:57.250 --> 00:49:59.260
PROFESSOR: We have a
few things to go on.

00:49:59.260 --> 00:50:03.520
There are a number of different
aspects of nuclear stability

00:50:03.520 --> 00:50:06.010
that are all pointing
to the same conclusion.

00:50:06.010 --> 00:50:08.140
One of them, you can
see on this graph here.

00:50:08.140 --> 00:50:10.180
If you look at the
alpha decay half-life

00:50:10.180 --> 00:50:12.070
as a function of
neutron number, it

00:50:12.070 --> 00:50:15.400
doesn't just increase or
decrease monotonically.

00:50:15.400 --> 00:50:17.470
It swells up and down.

00:50:17.470 --> 00:50:20.770
And it reaches a
relative maximum

00:50:20.770 --> 00:50:22.690
near certain magic numbers.

00:50:22.690 --> 00:50:26.110
We can confirm that with
the lower mass nuclei.

00:50:26.110 --> 00:50:27.640
It doesn't work for
really low mass,

00:50:27.640 --> 00:50:31.210
because tiny things don't
tend to undergo alpha decay.

00:50:31.210 --> 00:50:33.760
But there are patterns
that we're simply

00:50:33.760 --> 00:50:37.930
recognizing and saying, well, if
this is the next magic number,

00:50:37.930 --> 00:50:39.590
it should continue to increase.

00:50:39.590 --> 00:50:43.600
And I should mention too,
this scale is logarithmic.

00:50:43.600 --> 00:50:46.900
So the top right here is
like 10 to the 4 seconds.

00:50:46.900 --> 00:50:49.930
Just so you know, there
are 86,400 seconds

00:50:49.930 --> 00:50:52.060
in-- what is it-- a day.

00:50:52.060 --> 00:50:55.340
And 3 times 10 to the
7 seconds in a year.

00:50:55.340 --> 00:50:56.430
So if this graph--

00:50:56.430 --> 00:50:59.370
let's say for Z 111--

00:50:59.370 --> 00:51:02.280
were to continue
on its track, it

00:51:02.280 --> 00:51:04.500
should reach like
10 to the 9 or 10

00:51:04.500 --> 00:51:08.160
to the 10, which could be
like 100-year lifetimes

00:51:08.160 --> 00:51:10.920
or 100-year half-lives,
which means definitely you

00:51:10.920 --> 00:51:13.470
can chemically separate them
and do things with them.

00:51:13.470 --> 00:51:16.350
I don't know if they would
be safe enough to deal with.

00:51:16.350 --> 00:51:18.790
But we also don't really
know what's going to happen.

00:51:18.790 --> 00:51:21.450
You can see that there
is some uncertainty,

00:51:21.450 --> 00:51:23.460
and things don't always
follow the trend.

00:51:23.460 --> 00:51:26.580
Even the error bars are
outside the dashed lines.

00:51:26.580 --> 00:51:27.810
But so we have this to go on.

00:51:27.810 --> 00:51:31.260
We have the alpha
decay half-life.

00:51:31.260 --> 00:51:33.630
We also have the
alpha decay energy.

00:51:33.630 --> 00:51:35.790
As you approach an
island of stability,

00:51:35.790 --> 00:51:37.860
something that's more
stable won't give off

00:51:37.860 --> 00:51:40.830
as much kinetic energy
to its alpha particle.

00:51:40.830 --> 00:51:44.520
There is also-- for the
ones that you can actually

00:51:44.520 --> 00:51:46.320
measure that live
long enough, you

00:51:46.320 --> 00:51:48.570
can measure their
mass to charge ratio

00:51:48.570 --> 00:51:51.990
and actually get a good
picture of their actual mass.

00:51:51.990 --> 00:51:55.290
So we would expect
the mass defect

00:51:55.290 --> 00:51:58.650
to follow a certain
trend as we go up.

00:51:58.650 --> 00:52:00.240
The mass is always
going to increase.

00:52:00.240 --> 00:52:03.600
If you add more nucleons,
it's going to increase.

00:52:03.600 --> 00:52:07.800
But the mass defect,
which is the real mass

00:52:07.800 --> 00:52:10.920
minus the atomic number mass--

00:52:10.920 --> 00:52:12.690
if stability were
to increase, do you

00:52:12.690 --> 00:52:15.730
think the mass defect
would increase or decrease

00:52:15.730 --> 00:52:17.404
with more stability?

00:52:22.290 --> 00:52:23.850
Let's take a quick look at this.

00:52:23.850 --> 00:52:29.730
If A were to stay the same,
a shrinking real mass--

00:52:29.730 --> 00:52:32.550
and remember, lower mass
means more stability--

00:52:32.550 --> 00:52:38.050
would mean a higher
or a low mass defect?

00:52:38.050 --> 00:52:42.520
It would mean a lower mass
defect or a lower excess mass

00:52:42.520 --> 00:52:43.880
as you'd call it.

00:52:43.880 --> 00:52:48.070
So in this case, you would
expect the mass of the nucleus

00:52:48.070 --> 00:52:53.960
to be smaller than its A if
it was going more stable.

00:52:53.960 --> 00:52:57.060
And all of these trends
work in the same direction,

00:52:57.060 --> 00:53:00.230
which is saying, OK, so
we have the alpha energy.

00:53:00.230 --> 00:53:01.610
We have the mass defect.

00:53:01.610 --> 00:53:04.580
We have the half-life all
pointing to the same thing

00:53:04.580 --> 00:53:07.250
that something should
be more stable.

00:53:07.250 --> 00:53:09.050
And we have some
patterns to go on,

00:53:09.050 --> 00:53:12.470
but our understanding
is kind of incomplete.

00:53:12.470 --> 00:53:14.700
So-- yeah?

00:53:14.700 --> 00:53:18.220
AUDIENCE: So if there's
super heavy elements,

00:53:18.220 --> 00:53:19.810
do they exist
somewhere in space,

00:53:19.810 --> 00:53:21.365
or do stars make them, possibly?

00:53:21.365 --> 00:53:21.990
PROFESSOR: Ooh.

00:53:21.990 --> 00:53:22.960
AUDIENCE: Or are they--

00:53:22.960 --> 00:53:24.756
PROFESSOR: Good question.

00:53:24.756 --> 00:53:26.798
AUDIENCE: --currently made?

00:53:26.798 --> 00:53:29.340
PROFESSOR: So the question is,
if super heavy elements exist,

00:53:29.340 --> 00:53:31.410
do they exist out
there in space?

00:53:31.410 --> 00:53:34.560
I think there would be a
couple places they would exist.

00:53:34.560 --> 00:53:37.950
The source of most of
the elements beyond iron

00:53:37.950 --> 00:53:42.660
is supernovas, where regular old
fusion doesn't cut it anymore.

00:53:42.660 --> 00:53:47.700
When you hit the maximum of
this binding energy per nucleon

00:53:47.700 --> 00:53:50.370
curve, you're at about iron 56.

00:53:50.370 --> 00:53:52.530
That's why stars tend
to form a core of iron

00:53:52.530 --> 00:53:55.560
before it goes really
bad in whatever way it

00:53:55.560 --> 00:53:56.610
does for a star.

00:53:56.610 --> 00:53:58.440
There are multiple ways.

00:53:58.440 --> 00:54:01.980
When you get a supernova,
you have an insane explosion,

00:54:01.980 --> 00:54:03.600
and the core gets
compressed from

00:54:03.600 --> 00:54:08.130
the outside, forcing fusion
of heavy elements to happen.

00:54:08.130 --> 00:54:10.720
That's because you're putting
in extra kinetic energy.

00:54:10.720 --> 00:54:14.970
So it's like you have an
endothermic reaction where

00:54:14.970 --> 00:54:19.020
if Q is less than zero, how do
you make that reaction happen?

00:54:19.020 --> 00:54:21.240
Add kinetic energy,
which can come

00:54:21.240 --> 00:54:24.690
from a tremendous explosion
outside of the outer regions

00:54:24.690 --> 00:54:26.128
of the star.

00:54:26.128 --> 00:54:28.420
So who's to say that some of
these super heavy elements

00:54:28.420 --> 00:54:30.010
aren't formed in supernovas?

00:54:30.010 --> 00:54:31.820
I think they would be.

00:54:31.820 --> 00:54:35.163
But would they actually make
it out to be part of Earth

00:54:35.163 --> 00:54:37.580
and then, let's say, live the
5 billion years that Earth's

00:54:37.580 --> 00:54:38.510
been around?

00:54:38.510 --> 00:54:41.290
We don't know if their
half-lives are long enough.

00:54:41.290 --> 00:54:44.940
There very well may have
been some 5 billion years ago

00:54:44.940 --> 00:54:46.880
or when the supernova was made.

00:54:46.880 --> 00:54:49.490
But we haven't detected
any here on Earth.

00:54:49.490 --> 00:54:53.760
So we know that they're
not 5 billion years stable.

00:54:53.760 --> 00:54:56.140
Rather, I wouldn't
even say we know that,

00:54:56.140 --> 00:54:58.790
but we have a pretty good idea.

00:54:58.790 --> 00:55:01.932
That's a great question is
like, are they naturally made?

00:55:01.932 --> 00:55:04.412
Probably.

00:55:04.412 --> 00:55:06.400
Yeah.

00:55:06.400 --> 00:55:08.020
Any other questions?

00:55:08.020 --> 00:55:09.940
I like these outside
the material ones.

00:55:09.940 --> 00:55:13.810
We can take things beyond
our known universe,

00:55:13.810 --> 00:55:15.960
start to explain them.

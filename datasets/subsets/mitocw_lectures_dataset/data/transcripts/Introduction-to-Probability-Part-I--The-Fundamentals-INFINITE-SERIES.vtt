00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:05.190
This will be a short tutorial
on infinite series, their

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.470
definition and their
basic properties.

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:10.000
What is an infinite series?

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.450
We're given a sequence of
numbers ai, indexed by i,

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:17.410
where i ranges from
1 to infinity.

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:18.730
So it's an infinite sequence.

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.470
And we want to add the terms
of that sequence together.

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.220
We denote the resulting sum of
that infinity of terms using

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:28.640
this notation.

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.080
But what does that
mean exactly?

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.990
What is the formal definition
of an infinite series?

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:37.630
Well, the infinite series is
defined as the limit, as n

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:42.040
goes to infinity, of the finite
series in which we add

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.160
only the first n terms
in the series.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.590
However, this definition makes
sense only as long as the

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:51.840
limit exists.

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:03.910
This brings up the question,
when does this limit exist?

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.810
The nicest case arises when
all the terms are

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.130
non-negative.

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.760
If all the terms are
non-negative,

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.710
here's what's happening.

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.870
We consider the partial sum
of the first n terms.

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:16.630
And then we increase n.

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:18.620
This means that we
add more terms.

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.600
So the partial sum keeps
becoming bigger and bigger.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.320
The sequence of partial sums
is a monotonic sequence.

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.130
Now monotonic sequences always
converge either to a finite

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.090
number or to infinity.

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.810
In either case, this
limit will exist.

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.039
And therefore, the series
is well defined.

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:45.610
The situation is more
complicated if the terms ai

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.830
can have different signs.

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:51.600
In that case, it's possible that
the limit does not exist.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.610
And so the series is
not well defined.

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:55.979
The more interesting and

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.570
complicated case is the following.

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:00.880
It's possible that this
limit exists.

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.860
However, if we rearrange the
terms in the sequence, we

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.430
might get a different limit.

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.300
When can we avoid those
complicated situations?

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:18.490
We can avoid them if it turns
out that the sum of the

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:24.620
absolute value of the numbers
sums to a finite number.

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.900
Now this series that we have
here is an infinite series in

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.579
which we add non-negative
numbers.

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:35.170
And by the fact that we
mentioned earlier, this

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.520
infinite series is always
well defined.

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.590
And it's going to be either
finite or infinite.

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:46.670
If it turns out to be finite,
then the original series is

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:53.790
guaranteed to be well defined,
to have a finite limit when we

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.630
define it that way, and
furthermore, that finite limit

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:02.450
is the same even if we rearrange
the different terms,

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.320
if we rearrange the sequence
with which we sum the

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:07.570
different terms.

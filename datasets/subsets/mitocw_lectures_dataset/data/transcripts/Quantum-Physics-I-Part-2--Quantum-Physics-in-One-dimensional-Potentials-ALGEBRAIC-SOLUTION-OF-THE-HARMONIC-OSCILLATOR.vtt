WEBVTT

00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:04.449
PROFESSOR: SHO algebraically.

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:17.300
And we go back to the
Hamiltonian, p squared over 2m

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:23.988
plus 1/2 m omega
squared x hat squared.

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.430
And what we do is observe
that this some sort

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:45.550
of sum of squares plus
p squared over m--

00:00:48.959 --> 00:00:53.615
p squared over m
squared omega squared.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.540
So the sum of two
things squared.

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:12.740
Now, the idea that
we have now is

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.652
to try to vectorize
the Hamiltonian.

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:25.970
And what we call vectorizing is
when you write your Hamiltonian

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:33.410
as the product of two vectors,
V times W. Well actually,

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:35.330
that's not quite
the vectorization.

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:42.510
You want kind of the same
vector, and not even that.

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:48.365
You sort of want this to be the
Hermitian conjugate of that.

00:01:48.365 --> 00:01:52.970
And if there is a
number here, that's OK.

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:58.220
Adding numbers to a Hamiltonian
doesn't change the problem

00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:59.380
at all.

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.250
The energies are all
shifted, and it's

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.920
just how you're defining
the zero of your potential,

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.850
is doing nothing but that.

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:14.860
So vectorizing the Hamiltonian
is writing it in this way,

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:22.580
as V dagger V. And you
would say, why V dagger V?

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:27.180
Why not VV dagger or VV
or V dagger V dagger?

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:32.640
Well, you want the
Hamiltonian to be Hermitian.

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.730
And this thing is Hermitian.

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.532
You may recall that AB dagger.

00:02:40.532 --> 00:02:45.880
The Hermitian conjugate of AB
dagger is B dagger A dagger.

00:02:48.684 --> 00:02:51.895
So the Hermitian
conjugate of this product

00:02:51.895 --> 00:02:56.940
is V dagger times the
dagger of V dagger.

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.390
A dagger of a dagger is the same
operator, when you dagger it

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.040
twice, you get the same.

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.260
So this is Hermitian.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.420
V dagger times V is
a Hermitian operator,

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.440
and that's a very good thing.

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.520
And there will be
great simplifications.

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:20.830
If you ever succeed in writing
a Hamiltonian this way,

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:27.130
you've gone 90% of the way
to solving the whole problem.

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:31.510
It has become infinitely easier,
as you will see in a second,

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:36.910
if you could just write
this vectorization.

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:43.220
So if you had x minus--

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:47.050
x squared minus this, you
would say, oh, clearly that's--

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:51.230
A squared minus B squared
is A minus B time A plus B,

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.440
but there's no such thing here.

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:59.660
It's almost like A
squared plus B squared.

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:02.230
And how do you sort
of factorize it?

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:05.450
Well, actually, since
we have complex numbers,

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:10.460
this could be A minus
IB times A plus IB.

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:18.540
That is correctly A
squared plus B squared,

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:24.130
and complex numbers are supposed
to be friends in quantum

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:30.670
mechanics, so having Is, there's
probably no complication there.

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:33.370
So let's try that.

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:34.280
I'll write it.

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:41.220
So here we have x
squared plus p squared

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.720
over m squared omega squared.

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:52.232
And I will try to write it as
x minus i p hat over m omega

00:04:52.232 --> 00:04:59.030
times x plus I p
hat over m omega.

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:04.390
Let's put the question
mark before we

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:06.015
are so sure that this works.

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:11.100
Well, some things work.

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:17.720
The only danger here is
that these are operators

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:18.910
and they don't commute.

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:24.120
And when we do this, in one
case, in the cross-terms,

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:28.995
the A is to the left of B,
but the other problem the B

00:05:28.995 --> 00:05:32.970
is to the left of A. So we
may run into some trouble.

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:36.810
This may not be exactly true.

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:38.125
So what is this?

00:05:40.795 --> 00:05:43.300
This x with x, fine.

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:45.930
x squared.

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:49.320
This term, p with ps, correct.

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:53.410
Plus p squared over m
squared omega squared.

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:59.540
But then we get
plus i over m omega,

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:08.740
x with p minus p with x,
so that x, p commutator.

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:13.490
So vectorization of operators
in quantum mechanics

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:17.600
can miss a few concepts
because things don't commute.

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:21.310
So the cross-terms
give you that,

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:30.500
and this x, p is I h bar, so
this whole term will give us

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:32.010
the following statement.

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:45.710
What we've learned is
that what we wanted,

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:52.990
x squared plus p
squared over m squared

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:57.910
omega squared is equal to--

00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:03.250
so I'm equating this
line to the top line--

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:10.990
is equal to x hat minus i
p hat over m omega times

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:16.150
x hat plus i p hat over m omega.

00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:27.040
And then, from this whole
term, i with i is minus,

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:32.290
so it's h bar over m omega.

00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:36.521
So I'll put it in--

00:07:36.521 --> 00:07:39.400
it's a minus h bar
over m, [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:46.650
So here is plus h bar
over m omega times

00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:49.030
a unit vector, if you wish.

00:07:55.356 --> 00:07:55.855
OK.

00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:02.950
So this is very good.

00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:14.150
In fact, we can call this
V dagger and this V. Better

00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:17.150
call this V first
and then ask, what

00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:20.640
is the dagger of this operator?

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:24.250
Now, you may remember that,
how did we define daggers?

00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:29.010
If you have phi with psi
and the inner product--

00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:31.920
with an integral
of five star psi--

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:36.280
if you have an A
psi here, that's

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:41.710
equal to A dagger phi psi.

00:08:43.530 --> 00:08:46.810
So an operator is acting
on the second wave

00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:51.030
function, moves as A dagger
into the first wave function.

00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:56.640
And you know that x moves
without any problem.

00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:58.020
x is Hermitian.

00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:01.730
We've discussed that p
is Hermitian as well,

00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:03.240
moves to the other side.

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:08.540
So the Hermitian
conjugate of this operator

00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:14.460
is x, the p remains means p,
but the i becomes minus i.

00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:15.780
So this is correct.

00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:20.280
If this second
operator is called V,

00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:23.310
the first operator should
be called V dagger.

00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:25.680
That is a correct statement.

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:29.880
One is the dagger
of the other one.

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:37.400
So the Hamiltonian
is 1/2 m omega

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:42.940
squared times this
sum of squares,

00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:51.130
which is now equal to V dagger
V plus h bar over m omega.

00:09:55.280 --> 00:10:00.730
So h hat is now
1/2 m omega squared

00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:11.100
V dagger V plus a sum, which
is plus 1/2 h bar omega.

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:17.850
So we did it.

00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:23.400
We vectorized the
Hamiltonian V dagger V,

00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:28.510
and this is quite useful.

00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:34.360
So the Vs, however, have units.

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:39.300
And you probably are aware that
we like things without units,

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:42.440
so that we can see
the units better.

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:44.410
This curve is perfectly nice.

00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:46.620
It's a number added
to the Hamiltonian.

00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:49.780
It's h omega, it
has units of energy,

00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:53.370
but this is still
a little messy.

00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:59.810
So let's try to clean up those
Vs, and the way I'll do it

00:10:59.810 --> 00:11:03.631
is by computing their
commutator, to begin with.

00:11:07.690 --> 00:11:15.520
So let's compute the
commutator of V and V dagger

00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:18.312
and see how much
is that commutator.

00:11:21.270 --> 00:11:24.360
It's a simple commutator,
because it involves vectors

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:31.040
of x and V. So
it's the commutator

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:39.180
of x plus ip over
m omega, that's V,

00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:43.537
with x minus ip over m omega.

00:11:47.530 --> 00:11:54.110
So the first x talks
only to the second piece,

00:11:54.110 --> 00:11:59.200
so it's minus i
over m omega x, p.

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:05.970
And for the second
case, you have plus

00:12:05.970 --> 00:12:09.180
i over am omega p with x.

00:12:12.996 --> 00:12:20.960
This is i h bar, and
this is minus i h bar.

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:25.050
Each term will contribute
the same, i times minus i

00:12:25.050 --> 00:12:32.610
is plus, so h bar over
and, omega times the 2.

00:12:32.610 --> 00:12:40.340
That is V dagger V.
VV dagger, I'm sorry.

00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:43.512
2 h bar over m omega.

00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:52.040
So time to change
names a little bit.

00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:53.980
Let's do the following.

00:12:53.980 --> 00:13:01.880
Let's put square root of
m omega over 2 h bar V.

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:07.971
Have a square root of m
omega over 2 h bar V dagger,

00:13:07.971 --> 00:13:09.740
commute to give you 1.

00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:12.190
That's a nice commutator.

00:13:12.190 --> 00:13:16.206
It's one number-- or an
operator is the same thing.

00:13:18.990 --> 00:13:21.470
So I brought the square
root into each one.

00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:29.810
And we'll call the first term--

00:13:29.810 --> 00:13:31.940
because of reasons
we'll see very soon--

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:43.560
the destruction operator, A
square root of m omega over 2 h

00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:50.438
bar V. It's called the
destruction operator.

00:13:50.438 --> 00:13:54.560
And the dagger is
going to be A dagger.

00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:58.360
Some people put hats on them.

00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:03.810
I sometimes do too,
unless I'm too tired.

00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:05.370
2h bar V dagger.

00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:12.600
And those A and A daggers
are now unit-free--

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:15.420
and you can check That--

00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:18.570
Because they have
the same units.

00:14:18.570 --> 00:14:23.890
And A with A dagger is
the nicest commutator, 1.

00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:33.880
Is A a Hermitian operator?

00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:38.150
Is it?

00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:39.060
No.

00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:40.410
A is not Hermitian.

00:14:40.410 --> 00:14:45.820
A dagger is different from
A. A is basically this thing,

00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:47.400
A dagger is this thing.

00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:49.350
So not Hermitian.

00:14:49.350 --> 00:14:52.204
So we're going to work
with these operators.

00:14:52.204 --> 00:14:53.120
They're non-Hermitian.

00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:56.900
I need to write the
following equations.

00:14:56.900 --> 00:15:01.080
It's very-- takes a
little bit of writing,

00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:05.370
but they should be
recorded, they will always

00:15:05.370 --> 00:15:08.000
make it to the formula sheet.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.770
And it's the basic relation
between A, A dagger, and x

00:15:12.770 --> 00:15:16.110
and p.

00:15:16.110 --> 00:15:21.160
A is this, A
dagger, as you know,

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:26.760
is x minus ip hat over m omega.

00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:30.410
Since I'm copying, I'd
better copy them right.

00:15:30.410 --> 00:15:33.150
x, on other hand,
is the square root

00:15:33.150 --> 00:15:39.190
of h bar over 2m
omega A plus A dagger,

00:15:39.190 --> 00:15:48.320
and p is equal to i square
root of m omega h bar over 2

00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:50.844
A dagger minus A.

00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:55.460
So these four equations,
A and A dagger

00:15:55.460 --> 00:16:02.390
in terms of x and p and
vice versa, are important.

00:16:02.390 --> 00:16:05.870
They will show up all the time.

00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:07.470
Here are the things to notice.

00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:10.290
A and A dagger is
visibly clear that

00:16:10.290 --> 00:16:14.830
on is the Hermitian
conjugate of the other.

00:16:14.830 --> 00:16:18.055
Here, x is Hermitian.

00:16:18.055 --> 00:16:20.950
And indeed, A plus A
dagger is Hermitian.

00:16:20.950 --> 00:16:24.780
When you do the Hermitian
conjugate of A plus A dagger,

00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:27.460
the first A becomes an A dagger.

00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:30.970
The second A, with another
Hermitian conjugation,

00:16:30.970 --> 00:16:34.110
becomes A. So this is Hermitian.

00:16:34.110 --> 00:16:38.100
But p is Hermitian, and here we
have A dagger minus A. This is

00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:40.140
not Hermitian, it changes sign.

00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:46.560
Well, the i is there for that
reason, and makes it Hermition.

00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:50.870
So there they are, they're
Hermitian, they're good.

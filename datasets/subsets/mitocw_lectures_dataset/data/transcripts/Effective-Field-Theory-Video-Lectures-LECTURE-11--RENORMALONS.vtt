00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.680
IAIN STEWART: [INAUDIBLE]
effective theory workshop.

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.660
So last time we were
talking about renormalons,

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.030
and we're going to
continue to do that today.

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:31.850
So we said that typically
in quantum field theory

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:34.060
you have perturbation
theories, but actually they're

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:34.970
asymptotic.

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:38.420
And the kind of growth that
you might expect as some power.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.840
I think I use two different
conventions for this power,

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.590
whether it's plus n
or minus n, but that's

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.390
just a goes to 1 over a, and
there's a factorial growth.

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.460
So we said we could
characterize those series

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:53.990
by thinking about
doing something

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:55.490
called a Borel
transform, and that

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:56.690
makes them more convergent.

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:58.523
Because, basically, we
take the coefficients

00:00:58.523 --> 00:01:00.650
and we divide the coefficients
by an n factorial.

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:03.110
So we get more
conversion series.

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:05.810
And it may be that
this thing exists,

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.260
or it may be that this
thing exists and has poles.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.440
And if it has poles,
as I've indicated here

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.350
on the real axis, then
the inverse transform

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:16.342
might not exist.

00:01:16.342 --> 00:01:18.800
So even though this thing is
something that you can define,

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.720
you can't get back to f.

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.730
And if that's the case,
you can characterize

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:26.150
how the original series was
diverging based on those poles.

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:27.890
And those poles are
called renormalons.

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.690
So if we could calculate to all
orders in perturbation theory

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.100
and some in quantum field
theory, like a gauge theory,

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.870
then we could just
calculate these f's.

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:44.360
We would find that actually
there is this factorial growth,

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.190
and we'd be able to do this.

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.190
But we can't do that,
because we don't know

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:51.120
how to do all the diagrams.

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.720
So in order to give you an
explicit example of what

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.730
we talked about
last time, instead

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:58.910
of looking at all the diagrams,
we pick a particular subset

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:59.900
that we can identify.

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.200
And that's what we're
going to do today,

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.680
at least start by doing today.

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:12.260
Part of our discussion
of motivating

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.110
why one might want to
think about renormalons

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.920
was thinking about the pole
mass versus the MS bar mass

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.650
and showing you
that phenomenology

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.810
starts to work better in
terms of the MS bar mass.

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.310
And then we even
further than that

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.810
and said we should talk about
this thing called the 1S mass,

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.080
and we'll come back to
that discussion today.

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.840
But I'd like to consider
just the explicit calculation

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.330
of the pole versus
the MS bar mass

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.749
and show you that you
can see this renormalon.

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:52.640
So if we want to think about
the definition of these masses,

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.510
then we have to implement those
definitions order by order

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.600
in perturbation theory.

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.770
And order by order in
perturbation theory,

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:02.900
we could calculate the f's.

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.840
But we need to know something
about the entire series,

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.430
and that is too hard to
get the complete series.

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.180
So we'll pick out an infinite
subset of that complete series

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:23.940
that we could identify
which is unique.

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.080
And of course we should pick
an infinite subset that's

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.980
the easiest to calculate.

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.640
And the one that we can pick
out that's easy to calculate

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.170
is the following--

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:49.870
we look at so-called bubble sum.

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:00.170
So graphs with a bubble, and
then more and more of them.

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:10.310
OK.

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:12.060
So the reason that
these graphs are unique

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.690
is because if you look at any
order in perturbation theory,

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:16.940
they're the grass
with the most factors

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:19.022
of the number of
fermions running around

00:04:19.022 --> 00:04:19.730
in these bubbles.

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:21.897
So if you call the number
of fermions running around

00:04:21.897 --> 00:04:25.760
in these bubbles nf, this graph
has the most powers of nf.

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:37.110
So at each order in perturbation
theory, it's unique.

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:38.670
It's a unique contribution.

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:40.110
And it's pretty
easy to calculate,

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.360
because there's only one
type of diagram contributing.

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:43.693
AUDIENCE: What does unique mean?

00:04:43.693 --> 00:04:44.730
[INAUDIBLE]

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:47.560
IAIN STEWART: Unique means
that there's no other diagram.

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.560
So you might think at
each other in perturbation

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:53.400
theory there's lots
and lots of diagrams.

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.290
There's only this
diagram that contributes

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:56.850
to the highest power nf.

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:59.310
It's also gauge
invariant, but it's really

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:02.580
a unique diagram that
contributes to that color

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:04.290
slash flavor structure.

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:08.860
OK.

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:11.650
So obviously an ingredient
in this is the bubble itself.

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:21.790
So if we go back to the
bubble plus it's counter term,

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:35.110
and we say there's a
momentum p going through it,

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:41.310
it's diagonal in color,
transverse in momentum.

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:48.510
It has a factor of an ns nf,
some other numerical factors.

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:54.485
There's a logarithm,
there' constant,

00:05:54.485 --> 00:05:55.860
and then there's
some divergence,

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:58.030
but we cancelled the
divergence with a counter.

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:01.590
So the graph would
look like that.

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.220
And I'm going to
absorb all these things

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:09.828
into a single logarithm
just for convenience.

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:19.200
So I define the constant
c bar, which is this 5/3,

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:22.250
and then I just put
it into the logarithm.

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:26.230
OK.

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:28.520
So then this is a
geometric series,

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:31.070
so it's easy to deal with.

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:40.240
So G mu nu, which is as
a function of p and alpha

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:51.490
s which sums up this
chain plus counterterm

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:55.990
diagrams where there's
n bubbles here,

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:58.150
and we start with no bubbles.

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:09.400
This n is a projector.

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:39.090
OK.

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:41.940
So this is explicitly
writing out the sum.

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:44.220
And what I've done here
is I've used the fact

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:46.740
that even though I
wrote up nf up there,

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:48.950
I can convert it to beta 0.

00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:55.740
So beta 0 was 11/3
C a minus 2/3 nf.

00:07:55.740 --> 00:08:00.300
I can solve that equation for
nf and substitute it back in.

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:02.580
And that is a
convenient thing to do,

00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:04.800
just because you can think
that these terms are then

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:06.912
related to the beta
0, which has to do

00:08:06.912 --> 00:08:07.995
with the running coupling.

00:08:10.883 --> 00:08:12.300
In some sense,
what we're doing is

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:15.600
we're saying that even though
we just calculated these nf

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:17.100
contributions, we
know there's going

00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:20.070
to be some non-Abelian
contribution that comes along

00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:22.800
with it that makes this
really into a beta 0.

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:24.840
Or another way of saying
it is that if you think

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:27.780
about characterizing
color structures,

00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:32.909
you could write nf
C a, nf f squared.

00:08:32.909 --> 00:08:37.900
Or you could write beta
0 C a, beta 0 squared,

00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:41.520
and these are equivalent
ways of representing

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:43.200
the different kinds
of color structures

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:45.150
that can come in
at higher order.

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:48.660
And we're just choosing to do
it this way with the beta 0,

00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:51.030
rather than the nf's.

00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:52.800
So we convert our
nf to a beta 0.

00:08:56.910 --> 00:09:00.480
And it's still a unique subset
of the entire set of terms.

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:03.240
The terms we're not including
our terms like this-- nf C a

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:03.975
or C a squared.

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:09.240
And we're just keeping
these guys, which

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:10.500
is equivalent to this guy.

00:09:13.113 --> 00:09:14.030
Foes that makes sense?

00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:17.800
Everybody happy?

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:19.550
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
photon [INAUDIBLE]..

00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:20.240
IAIN STEWART: Sorry.

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:21.270
AUDIENCE: Where are
the photon propagators?

00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:22.812
IAIN STEWART: The
photon propagators.

00:09:22.812 --> 00:09:26.958
So the photon propagators
all cancel each other out.

00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:29.000
So you get a piece greater
than 1 over p squared,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.840
p squared 1 over p squared.

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:34.117
So the whole thing looks
like a photon propagator,

00:09:34.117 --> 00:09:35.200
just with a bunch of logs.

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:41.490
Any other questions?

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:47.500
All right.

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:49.810
So this is already
of the structure

00:09:49.810 --> 00:09:53.980
where we could think about
doing the Borel transform.

00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:55.630
Because we have a
series in alpha s,

00:09:55.630 --> 00:09:58.210
and what the Borel transport
meant was taking that series

00:09:58.210 --> 00:10:01.330
and converting it to a
series in the Borel variable,

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:03.600
just dividing by n factorial
and then doing a sum.

00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:15.030
So previously, the
way I wrote that,

00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:17.010
for the conjugate
variables, we wrote that we

00:10:17.010 --> 00:10:18.930
had alpha to the n plus 1.

00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:23.400
And if you think about what we
do, we just went to b to the n

00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:26.250
over n factorial.

00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:29.280
So basically, to
convert from this guy

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:30.930
to this guy, that's what we did.

00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:34.747
And we had to take special
care at the first term.

00:10:34.747 --> 00:10:36.330
But other than the
first term, we just

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:37.413
had this replacement rule.

00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:49.290
Now, it's a little convenient
actually not to do that

00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:51.990
with exactly the same variable
but a slightly different

00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:55.260
variable that's just rescaled.

00:10:55.260 --> 00:11:03.790
So I'm going to use a slightly
different variable here,

00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:06.970
which is typical.

00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:12.770
So what we'll do is we'll say
that instead of just taking

00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:16.640
along the alpha s, we'll take
along with it the beta 0.

00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:23.870
And we'll say that the
conjugate variable of that

00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:27.355
is u instead of b, but
it's just rescaled.

00:11:27.355 --> 00:11:28.730
We're just taking
something along

00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:31.543
with the coupling constant.

00:11:31.543 --> 00:11:33.210
Which is always we're
always free to do.

00:11:33.210 --> 00:11:36.180
It's just a
multiplicative factor.

00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:38.470
Now, if we look at
this diagram here,

00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:40.470
the factors of the coupling
that we've included

00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:43.080
are all the ones that are
attached to the bubbles.

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:47.578
But there's two more-- there's
one here and one there.

00:11:47.578 --> 00:11:49.620
And if we're going to make
this replacement rule,

00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:51.840
we have to identify all
the factors of alpha s,

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:55.500
because they're all going to
disappear and become u's. So we

00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:57.300
have to take these
guys into account too.

00:12:07.230 --> 00:12:13.460
We have an extra
G squared, which

00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:15.335
I'm going to write in
terms of this variable.

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:50.065
So there's an extra factor
of G squared from the ends.

00:12:50.065 --> 00:12:51.690
And if you think
about what that means,

00:12:51.690 --> 00:12:54.630
it means that every diagram
that we're considering here

00:12:54.630 --> 00:12:56.220
starts with n equals
1, so we don't

00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:59.590
have to worry about this
delta function term.

00:12:59.590 --> 00:13:02.820
It starts with n equals 0.

00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:05.490
There's no term with
no couplings here.

00:13:08.250 --> 00:13:09.755
So then it is
literally what I said,

00:13:09.755 --> 00:13:12.255
that we just take this factor
and replace it by that factor.

00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:25.330
So a Borel transform,
remember, is a transform

00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:27.040
of the variable alpha s.

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:30.440
Alpha s goes over to
a different space.

00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:32.138
So it's not a
kinematic variable.

00:13:32.138 --> 00:13:34.180
It's not like what we're
used to transforming in,

00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:39.090
but it's perfectly fine.

00:13:39.090 --> 00:13:41.548
For those people that
came in after I said this,

00:13:41.548 --> 00:13:42.840
there's no lecture on Thursday.

00:13:56.900 --> 00:13:59.360
So let me use the
following notation,

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:05.950
taking that G squared along
with our geometric sum,

00:14:05.950 --> 00:14:08.680
and now expressing that whole
thing as a function of momentum

00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:10.660
still, and u instead of alpha s.

00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:46.080
So I replaced the
alpha s's, and I

00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:49.290
get that series,
which we can see

00:14:49.290 --> 00:14:52.950
is just an exponential series.

00:14:52.950 --> 00:14:54.548
So I can just calculate the sum.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.212
Borel variable u log--

00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:26.820
which if you have an exponential
of a log, it's just a power.

00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:28.990
So let's organize it that way.

00:15:41.780 --> 00:16:04.710
So let me write it this
way So just writing

00:16:04.710 --> 00:16:08.490
the exponential of a log is that
thing raised to the power u,

00:16:08.490 --> 00:16:12.885
taking the mu squared to the
c bar u, that's a constant.

00:16:12.885 --> 00:16:14.760
And then taking all the
factors of p squared,

00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:17.890
there is one from here, and then
there's u of them from there.

00:16:17.890 --> 00:16:19.530
but I took an extra
one from here,

00:16:19.530 --> 00:16:21.840
multiplied on top and bottom
by an extra p squared.

00:16:24.428 --> 00:16:25.720
Hopefully I got the sign right.

00:16:29.066 --> 00:16:30.440
Looks like it should be plus.

00:16:38.070 --> 00:16:38.570
OK.

00:16:38.570 --> 00:16:41.090
So this thing is kind of
nice for computations,

00:16:41.090 --> 00:16:44.480
because when you stick it
back into our bubble sum--

00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:47.690
when you stick this
bubble sum back

00:16:47.690 --> 00:16:51.290
into the diagram we
want to compute--

00:16:51.290 --> 00:16:54.140
we just have effectively a
modified gluon propagator.

00:16:57.960 --> 00:17:04.895
So think of it as some kind
of modified gluon propagator.

00:17:04.895 --> 00:17:06.770
Maybe I should write it
in a different color.

00:17:10.157 --> 00:17:12.490
So it's just like this, where
we use a different Feynman

00:17:12.490 --> 00:17:14.053
rule for that propagator.

00:17:28.099 --> 00:17:29.630
So it's not actually--

00:17:29.630 --> 00:17:33.230
doing these types of
bubble sum calculations

00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:35.570
is not any more hard than
doing a one loop calculation,

00:17:35.570 --> 00:17:38.210
you just have to use a different
power for the propagator.

00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:44.090
But your Feynman integral tricks
can handle that very easily.

00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:48.780
OK.

00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:51.072
So it's about as hard as
computing this one with graph.

00:17:53.830 --> 00:18:02.350
So let's call this
thing sigma bubble,

00:18:02.350 --> 00:18:07.150
and let's think
about calculating it

00:18:07.150 --> 00:18:08.890
in terms of the MS bar mass.

00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:24.290
And then we also cancel any
one of our epsilon poles, which

00:18:24.290 --> 00:18:26.600
we're not really
interested in here.

00:18:36.530 --> 00:18:39.644
The 1 over epsilon poles
actually come from--

00:18:39.644 --> 00:18:42.790
if we think about what
happened with the variables--

00:18:42.790 --> 00:18:48.090
the case u equal 0, which
is the log divergent piece.

00:18:56.620 --> 00:18:59.260
And if you think
about what we want

00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:02.470
to do in order to
look for poles,

00:19:02.470 --> 00:19:06.220
u equals 0 is actually related
to the ultraviolet divergence,

00:19:06.220 --> 00:19:09.123
while values u greater
than 0 and u less than 0,

00:19:09.123 --> 00:19:10.540
those are probing
these poles that

00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:12.580
are off the axis
in the Borel plane.

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:30.380
And it's those power
law divergences that

00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:33.050
are probing for renormalons.

00:19:33.050 --> 00:19:36.860
And we'll see that they lead
to poles in the Borel plane

00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:38.390
through this
modified propagator.

00:19:46.510 --> 00:19:48.103
So let's calculate--
the goal here

00:19:48.103 --> 00:19:50.020
is going to be to calculate
an expression that

00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:52.653
relates to the MS bar
mass and the pole mass.

00:19:52.653 --> 00:19:54.070
And that'll be an
infinite series,

00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:57.738
and it will be a
function in Borel space.

00:19:57.738 --> 00:20:00.530
The alpha s space, that would be
an infinite series in alpha s,

00:20:00.530 --> 00:20:02.780
because we've included an
infinite number of alpha s's

00:20:02.780 --> 00:20:04.625
in our diagrams.

00:20:04.625 --> 00:20:06.000
And if we go over
to Borel space,

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.850
there'll be some functional
relationship between those two

00:20:07.850 --> 00:20:08.350
masses.

00:20:14.370 --> 00:20:17.520
OK, so what's the
definition of a pole mass.

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:21.510
If you go back to the
propagator and you write it

00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:22.860
in terms of the MS bar mass--

00:20:26.928 --> 00:20:28.970
so you formulated your
whole quantum field theory

00:20:28.970 --> 00:20:30.720
in terms of the MS bar
mass, you calculate

00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:33.260
that bubble some,
called it sigma,

00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:35.690
wrote it in terms
of MS bar mass--

00:20:35.690 --> 00:20:39.230
the general structure
of sigma would

00:20:39.230 --> 00:20:42.020
be that there is some constant
piece, which I'll call sigma 1.

00:20:49.780 --> 00:21:06.680
And then there's
some sigma 2 piece.

00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:10.490
And the pole mass is the
place where you demand--

00:21:10.490 --> 00:21:14.150
you just have p
slash minus m pole.

00:21:14.150 --> 00:21:32.355
So another way of saying
that is that if p squared is

00:21:32.355 --> 00:21:49.028
equal to m pole squared, you
set that to be 0, which I can

00:21:49.028 --> 00:21:50.320
write as an equation like that.

00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:52.400
And then I can square it.

00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:57.690
So m pole squared, which
is p slash squared,

00:21:57.690 --> 00:22:11.360
m bar squared,
this thing squared.

00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:14.740
And if you just think
about what that gives,

00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:16.600
this is giving
some equation that

00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:23.230
looks like m pole is
m bar, m 1 plus sigma

00:22:23.230 --> 00:22:25.630
1 plus the extra stuff.

00:22:38.690 --> 00:22:43.690
So let's do that
and figure out what

00:22:43.690 --> 00:22:45.820
we get from this
diagram for the sigma.

00:22:56.690 --> 00:23:07.380
So it's a usual one
loop type calculation,

00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:09.210
except instead of
the gluon propagator,

00:23:09.210 --> 00:23:19.270
I have this G mu nu
thing, which at this point

00:23:19.270 --> 00:23:20.770
is in alpha space, let's say.

00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:27.040
And then I have the
fermion propagator.

00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:38.750
And I've taken into account all
the g squareds and the alpha

00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:40.930
s's in here.

00:23:40.930 --> 00:23:42.880
And so to go to
the Borel space, I

00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:44.320
can do that under the integrand.

00:23:51.690 --> 00:23:59.230
So I just take g squared
G mu nu bubble k and alpha

00:23:59.230 --> 00:24:02.040
s, k being the loop
momenta, and just

00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:06.450
send that over to this thing
that I'm calling g squared G mu

00:24:06.450 --> 00:24:11.370
nu bubble, which is not a
function of g squared anymore,

00:24:11.370 --> 00:24:15.060
but just a function of k and u.

00:24:19.710 --> 00:24:23.160
And as long as you're
staying away from u equals 0,

00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:24.840
there's no issues
related to the order

00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:27.045
of doing those operations.

00:24:27.045 --> 00:24:29.670
So at u equals 0, you have to be
actually careful if you really

00:24:29.670 --> 00:24:31.980
want to go figure out what's
happening at u equals 0.

00:24:31.980 --> 00:24:34.390
But that's actually not
what we're interested in,

00:24:34.390 --> 00:24:37.320
so we'll just ignore what's
happening at u equals 0.

00:24:41.810 --> 00:24:42.310
OK.

00:24:42.310 --> 00:24:44.740
So combine-- stick
in the expression

00:24:44.740 --> 00:24:47.553
that we had over
here for this guy,

00:24:47.553 --> 00:24:49.220
and it's just some p
squared to a power.

00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:51.285
So it becomes a k
squared to a power.

00:24:51.285 --> 00:24:52.660
So you have k
squared to a power,

00:24:52.660 --> 00:24:54.190
you have this guy to a power--

00:24:54.190 --> 00:24:56.300
use the usual tricks.

00:24:56.300 --> 00:25:10.810
Combine denominators,
do algebra,

00:25:10.810 --> 00:25:23.135
and you get some expression
for sigma 1 in Borel space.

00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:33.830
And then, from that,
you can construct

00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:37.040
the relation between the pole
mass and the MS bar mass.

00:25:49.190 --> 00:25:53.330
And it might not surprise,
having done some one loop

00:25:53.330 --> 00:26:00.320
calculations that you're
getting some gamma functions,

00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:04.610
after the dust settles,
this is what it looks like.

00:26:18.130 --> 00:26:27.970
6, 1 minus u, gamma of u, gamma
of 1 minus 2u over gamma of 3

00:26:27.970 --> 00:26:28.570
minus u.

00:26:32.310 --> 00:26:34.230
So the piece that
we just calculated,

00:26:34.230 --> 00:26:37.680
or sketched how you
would calculate, is this.

00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:39.450
And then there's the
tree level relation

00:26:39.450 --> 00:26:42.570
between these two things,
which in alpha s space

00:26:42.570 --> 00:26:44.850
was just that m pole
was equal to m bar.

00:26:44.850 --> 00:26:47.310
But when you transform
one to the Borel space,

00:26:47.310 --> 00:26:49.300
you get a delta function.

00:26:49.300 --> 00:26:50.160
So this comes from--

00:27:01.190 --> 00:27:02.720
just that equality
at lowest order

00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:04.640
becomes a delta function
in the Borel space.

00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:10.930
So now, if you look at this
and you ignore u equals 0,

00:27:10.930 --> 00:27:14.140
then the closest pole to
u equals 0 is equals 1/2

00:27:14.140 --> 00:27:15.490
coming from this gamma function.

00:27:22.530 --> 00:27:26.300
And remember that we
had a kind of notation

00:27:26.300 --> 00:27:27.740
for the strength
of a renormalon.

00:27:27.740 --> 00:27:33.410
Those closest to the
origin were the strongest.

00:27:33.410 --> 00:27:37.322
So the strongest renormalon here
is a u equals 1/2 renormalon.

00:27:49.630 --> 00:27:51.370
That strength was
related to the fact

00:27:51.370 --> 00:27:55.780
that basically you got something
that would be, in this case, 2

00:27:55.780 --> 00:27:58.910
to the n, n factorial.

00:27:58.910 --> 00:28:03.320
So 1.2 to the minus n.

00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:07.220
And so the guy that's closest
gets the strongest prefactor

00:28:07.220 --> 00:28:10.070
through the n factorial growth.

00:28:10.070 --> 00:28:12.470
That's where that
naming came from.

00:28:12.470 --> 00:28:13.850
Yeah.

00:28:13.850 --> 00:28:15.860
AUDIENCE: So there weren't
[? mu poles ?] in--

00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:19.700
the only pole in the modified
gluon propagator, was it--

00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:23.657
Oh, like, the one that made
the denominator vanish.

00:28:23.657 --> 00:28:25.490
But the rest of the
poles came from actually

00:28:25.490 --> 00:28:26.570
doing the one with the diagram.

00:28:26.570 --> 00:28:26.990
IAIN STEWART: That's right.

00:28:26.990 --> 00:28:27.830
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:28.430
AUDIENCE: --in the series.

00:28:28.430 --> 00:28:29.222
IAIN STEWART: Yeah.

00:28:29.222 --> 00:28:32.030
So what you're doing
is you're actually

00:28:32.030 --> 00:28:35.330
thinking of probing the
infrared structure in this loop.

00:28:35.330 --> 00:28:37.110
That's what the gluon is doing.

00:28:37.110 --> 00:28:40.575
And the modified propagator
p squared to the u

00:28:40.575 --> 00:28:43.273
is just giving you a kind
of a regulator if you like,

00:28:43.273 --> 00:28:44.690
which is the u
that's allowing you

00:28:44.690 --> 00:28:48.680
to probe what's the
infrastructure in powers

00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:51.680
in this loop diagram, not just
kind of logarithmic divergences

00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:55.310
which we usually focus on but
also in power law sensitivity

00:28:55.310 --> 00:28:56.370
to the infrared.

00:28:56.370 --> 00:28:58.760
So it's like probing
low momentum gluons

00:28:58.760 --> 00:29:01.790
with this modified
gluon propagator.

00:29:01.790 --> 00:29:07.190
And that's what's
resulting in these poles.

00:29:07.190 --> 00:29:09.620
You're probing the infrared
structure of the loop.

00:29:12.850 --> 00:29:16.810
So there would be some other
terms that I haven't written.

00:29:16.810 --> 00:29:23.990
So let me just comment
that there's actually

00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:26.450
a term that's proportional
to 1 over u that would make

00:29:26.450 --> 00:29:34.122
it finite at u equals 0
if we're more careful,

00:29:34.122 --> 00:29:36.080
when we carry out the
renormalization properly.

00:29:40.970 --> 00:29:50.600
And I also wasn't so worried
about anything analytic in u.

00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:53.970
So I only was looking at
these gamma functions.

00:29:57.720 --> 00:29:58.220
OK.

00:29:58.220 --> 00:30:03.050
So if we actually just specify
ourselves to that u equals 1/2,

00:30:03.050 --> 00:30:04.660
we can simplify
things even further.

00:30:15.210 --> 00:30:18.560
So stick in u equals 1/2.

00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:24.170
And if I stick in u to the
1/2, this becomes mu over m bar

00:30:24.170 --> 00:30:26.785
e to the c bar over 2.

00:30:26.785 --> 00:30:31.460
If I just put this 1/2
in there, all this stuff

00:30:31.460 --> 00:30:34.490
with the gamma functions becomes
a minus 2 over u minus 1/2.

00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:39.410
So there's a pole.

00:30:39.410 --> 00:30:44.280
It's sitting on the real axis,
and we can't do the transform.

00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:47.795
AUDIENCE: At this point
can you drop the delta u?

00:30:47.795 --> 00:30:49.010
Because you know it's not--

00:30:49.010 --> 00:30:51.800
IAIN STEWART: Yeah, I
don't really need it.

00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:55.290
But just sort of for
completeness I kept it.

00:30:55.290 --> 00:30:55.790
Yeah.

00:30:55.790 --> 00:30:59.640
If I just wanted to think about
this term, I could drop it.

00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:00.140
Yeah.

00:31:05.610 --> 00:31:07.350
So let's think about
the inverse Borel.

00:31:12.090 --> 00:31:15.240
So we wanted to do an
integral which in this u space

00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:17.560
would look like this--

00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:23.510
so u is the conjugate variable
to 4 pi over beta 0 alpha s

00:31:23.510 --> 00:31:25.140
of mu.

00:31:25.140 --> 00:31:28.410
That was what we transformed.

00:31:28.410 --> 00:31:31.653
So that's the difference
between our old notation

00:31:31.653 --> 00:31:32.320
and our new one.

00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:36.310
We just have a conjugate
variable to this thing.

00:31:36.310 --> 00:31:39.038
And so this has an ambiguity,
because on the real axis

00:31:39.038 --> 00:31:40.330
we have a pole at u equals 1/2.

00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:53.920
So there's that
pole at 1/2, and you

00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:57.025
have to decide do we want to
go around that above or below.

00:32:00.315 --> 00:32:01.690
So I mentioned
this last time, we

00:32:01.690 --> 00:32:07.450
could think about going
past the pole that way

00:32:07.450 --> 00:32:09.360
or going past the pole this way.

00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:11.110
And the fact that we
have to make a choice

00:32:11.110 --> 00:32:14.650
means there's an ambiguity.

00:32:14.650 --> 00:32:16.420
And if you like,
you can say, well,

00:32:16.420 --> 00:32:20.170
it's the average above and below
or that the ambiguity would

00:32:20.170 --> 00:32:22.450
then be something like
1/2 going around the pole.

00:32:32.130 --> 00:32:34.290
So let's actually look
at what the ambiguity is.

00:32:54.670 --> 00:33:00.930
So the ambiguity, well,
if we go around the pole,

00:33:00.930 --> 00:33:03.708
we get a 2 pi i.

00:33:03.708 --> 00:33:15.375
There's 1/2, integral around
the pole, this factor.

00:33:19.980 --> 00:33:26.390
So mu c bar over 2, bar.

00:33:26.390 --> 00:33:27.940
And if we put
everything together,

00:33:27.940 --> 00:33:34.010
the rest of the prefactor,
there's a C f over 3 pi beta 0,

00:33:34.010 --> 00:33:37.300
and there's also
another m bar, which

00:33:37.300 --> 00:33:40.810
is this m bar that's out front.

00:33:40.810 --> 00:33:47.996
And I combined the minus 2
with the six together, 3.

00:33:47.996 --> 00:33:50.472
So the m bars actually
are cancelling.

00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:10.426
We close on the pole, stick
that value in everywhere else,

00:34:10.426 --> 00:34:11.560
and we get that.

00:34:16.503 --> 00:34:17.670
Does anybody recognize this?

00:34:22.810 --> 00:34:25.389
AUDIENCE: It's
like an instanton.

00:34:25.389 --> 00:34:26.639
IAIN STEWART: It's lambda QCD.

00:34:26.639 --> 00:34:27.139
Yeah.

00:34:29.937 --> 00:34:32.520
Yeah, it looks kind of like an
instanton with the exponential,

00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:36.130
but this particular thing is
actually exactly lambda QCD.

00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:42.835
So if we solve this,
and we invert it,

00:34:42.835 --> 00:34:45.210
and we solve for alpha s, that
would be the usual formula

00:34:45.210 --> 00:34:46.290
for lambda QCD--

00:34:46.290 --> 00:34:47.790
alpha in terms of lambda QCD.

00:34:52.719 --> 00:34:55.469
So we've just shown
that the ambiguity

00:34:55.469 --> 00:35:03.180
up to some constant prefactor
is exactly lambda QCD.

00:35:03.180 --> 00:35:14.890
And that is exactly
our physical idea

00:35:14.890 --> 00:35:19.720
that we said last time, that
the pole mass has a delta m

00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:24.990
of order lambda QCD ambiguity.

00:35:24.990 --> 00:35:26.820
And we've just seen
that explicitly

00:35:26.820 --> 00:35:29.475
arise from calculations
with this Borel space.

00:35:35.330 --> 00:35:37.930
So that's kind of neat Yeah.

00:35:37.930 --> 00:35:42.530
AUDIENCE: So Is there a way to
be careful about the pi epsilon

00:35:42.530 --> 00:35:44.750
description when we do
these Borel transforms?

00:35:44.750 --> 00:35:45.110
IAIN STEWART: Yeah.

00:35:45.110 --> 00:35:46.478
AUDIENCE: Because it seems
like you just multiplied

00:35:46.478 --> 00:35:48.500
a bunch of p squareds
plus i epsilons

00:35:48.500 --> 00:35:50.678
together, and then just
ignored the i epsilon.

00:35:50.678 --> 00:35:51.470
IAIN STEWART: Yeah.

00:35:51.470 --> 00:35:53.900
I didn't ignore the i epsilon.

00:35:53.900 --> 00:35:56.320
The reason I wrote it as a
minus p squared to the power

00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:58.440
was because of that i epsilon.

00:35:58.440 --> 00:36:01.110
I didn't write the i
epsilons on the board.

00:36:01.110 --> 00:36:04.590
But if I had, it wouldn't
change anything that I wrote.

00:36:04.590 --> 00:36:07.160
So the one way I can say
it is that when I actually

00:36:07.160 --> 00:36:09.020
did these loop
calculations, I was actually

00:36:09.020 --> 00:36:12.260
careful about the i epsilon.

00:36:12.260 --> 00:36:14.510
AUDIENCE: I'm not worried
about getting the sign--

00:36:14.510 --> 00:36:14.875
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:36:14.875 --> 00:36:15.667
IAIN STEWART: Yeah.

00:36:15.667 --> 00:36:16.750
AUDIENCE: --like of logs.

00:36:16.750 --> 00:36:19.400
I'm worried about
actually defining products

00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:20.830
of distributions right.

00:36:20.830 --> 00:36:22.955
Like when you interchange
the order of integration,

00:36:22.955 --> 00:36:25.428
presumably you're doing
something [INAUDIBLE]----

00:36:25.428 --> 00:36:27.470
IAIN STEWART: You mean
the order of the summation

00:36:27.470 --> 00:36:28.460
and the integration?

00:36:28.460 --> 00:36:29.127
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:36:29.127 --> 00:36:30.350
IAIN STEWART: Yeah.

00:36:30.350 --> 00:36:33.350
When you interchange that
order, the only thing that you--

00:36:33.350 --> 00:36:34.942
so you can do it
in the other order.

00:36:34.942 --> 00:36:36.650
The only thing that
actually goes wrong--

00:36:36.650 --> 00:36:38.692
and it's much easier to
present it in this order.

00:36:38.692 --> 00:36:39.920
This is why I did.

00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:41.520
If you do do it in
the other order,

00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:44.905
the only thing that will change
is what happens at u equals 0.

00:36:44.905 --> 00:36:46.280
So you'll actually
see everything

00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:48.560
that we saw, except
that u equals zero,

00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:49.820
it'll be slightly different.

00:36:49.820 --> 00:36:52.093
And that 1 over u term
that I was talking about,

00:36:52.093 --> 00:36:53.510
if you want to get
that right, you

00:36:53.510 --> 00:36:55.610
have to think about
the issue of changing

00:36:55.610 --> 00:36:57.740
the order of integration
more carefully than I did.

00:36:57.740 --> 00:36:59.407
AUDIENCE: But if it's
near u equals 1/2.

00:36:59.407 --> 00:37:01.550
IAIN STEWART: Near u
equals 1/2, it's exactly--

00:37:01.550 --> 00:37:04.960
this is the right result.
And near any other u except u

00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:08.385
equals 0 we're OK.

00:37:08.385 --> 00:37:09.010
AUDIENCE: Iain?

00:37:09.010 --> 00:37:09.802
IAIN STEWART: Yeah.

00:37:09.802 --> 00:37:11.096
AUDIENCE: So which [INAUDIBLE]?

00:37:11.096 --> 00:37:12.010
IAIN STEWART: Sorry.

00:37:12.010 --> 00:37:14.360
AUDIENCE: Which [INAUDIBLE]
would it be to define--

00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:16.330
IAIN STEWART: We don't know.

00:37:16.330 --> 00:37:20.440
So the ambiguity-- you have
to make a choice, right?

00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:22.690
If you make this choice,
you've picked one definition.

00:37:22.690 --> 00:37:24.648
If you make this choice,
you've picked another.

00:37:24.648 --> 00:37:27.370
And I said, we can quantify
the ambiguity in our choice

00:37:27.370 --> 00:37:31.660
by thinking about it as
1/2 going around the pole.

00:37:31.660 --> 00:37:34.510
That's kind of a
measure of the ambiguity

00:37:34.510 --> 00:37:37.390
that we have in
which way to close.

00:37:37.390 --> 00:37:38.672
It's an ambiguity.

00:37:38.672 --> 00:37:39.380
AUDIENCE: I know.

00:37:39.380 --> 00:37:42.760
But when [INAUDIBLE] on
how we calculate it, right?

00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:48.610
So when we can m pole,
what do we mean by--

00:37:48.610 --> 00:37:51.637
IAIN STEWART: Different
people mean different things.

00:37:51.637 --> 00:37:53.470
I mean, you're not going
to see this, right,

00:37:53.470 --> 00:37:55.512
unless you got all orders
in perturbation theory.

00:37:55.512 --> 00:37:57.640
So order by order in
perturbation theory,

00:37:57.640 --> 00:38:01.280
you will never see this pole.

00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:03.403
So unless you're
working to all orders--

00:38:03.403 --> 00:38:04.820
as soon as you
work to all orders,

00:38:04.820 --> 00:38:07.170
you have to make a choice
because of what we just did.

00:38:07.170 --> 00:38:09.420
If you work order by order,
there's no choice to make,

00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:11.000
and you just order
by order define it

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:12.692
with the usual definition.

00:38:19.590 --> 00:38:22.040
So the moral is not how
do we define m pole,

00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:23.540
the moral is we
should use something

00:38:23.540 --> 00:38:24.620
else other than m pole.

00:38:24.620 --> 00:38:26.240
Because m pole has an ambiguity.

00:38:42.930 --> 00:38:47.340
So we use the MS bar mass m
bar here for our calculation,

00:38:47.340 --> 00:38:50.580
but actually the ambiguity
wasn't depending on that.

00:38:50.580 --> 00:38:52.470
It really will show up--

00:38:52.470 --> 00:38:54.900
even if we thought of some
other short distance mass

00:38:54.900 --> 00:38:57.600
beside the MS bar
mass, we would still

00:38:57.600 --> 00:38:59.100
see the same
ambiguity if we tried

00:38:59.100 --> 00:39:01.710
to associated it to the m pole.

00:39:01.710 --> 00:39:05.940
And actually, this thing
is a unique property

00:39:05.940 --> 00:39:06.840
of the pole mass.

00:39:06.840 --> 00:39:09.960
It's the pole mass that has this
problem, not the MS bar mass.

00:39:20.220 --> 00:39:22.740
Another thing you'll
notice is that when

00:39:22.740 --> 00:39:25.620
we went back and looked
at the ambiguity back

00:39:25.620 --> 00:39:29.970
in the original
space, in the coupling

00:39:29.970 --> 00:39:37.060
space, which is where we
live, then the mu dependence

00:39:37.060 --> 00:39:39.100
went away.

00:39:39.100 --> 00:39:41.680
We just got something that was
a constant times lambda QCD.

00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:43.236
There was no mu dependence.

00:39:48.472 --> 00:39:52.950
So the ambiguity
is mu independent.

00:40:00.030 --> 00:40:01.490
It's proportional to lambda QCD.

00:40:04.310 --> 00:40:08.840
If we looked, on the other
hand, in the Borel space,

00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:13.471
at the residue of the
pole, it was mu dependent.

00:40:22.252 --> 00:40:23.960
So before we did the
integral, if we just

00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:26.840
look at even the
pole as u minus 1/2,

00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:30.530
the residue has mu power
in it in the numerator.

00:40:30.530 --> 00:40:33.620
And that just went along for
the ride and became this mu.

00:40:33.620 --> 00:40:37.580
But when we transformed
back, we had alpha mu there,

00:40:37.580 --> 00:40:42.030
and the mu dependence
was cancelling.

00:40:42.030 --> 00:40:43.670
And this actually is--

00:40:43.670 --> 00:40:46.620
there's one important
fact about this.

00:40:46.620 --> 00:40:58.800
So when we express something
like a decay rate, which

00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:03.240
we might originally calculate
in terms of the pole mass

00:41:03.240 --> 00:41:14.320
since maybe that's simpler, and
we get some series, if we want

00:41:14.320 --> 00:41:22.180
to express that, say, in
terms of the MS bar mass,

00:41:22.180 --> 00:41:24.040
then what we're
after doing is we're

00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:28.690
after actually canceling
a pole in the Borel plane

00:41:28.690 --> 00:41:30.670
that occurs in kind of
the series that relates

00:41:30.670 --> 00:41:32.590
this guy to the MS bar mass.

00:41:32.590 --> 00:41:34.240
And then there's a
corresponding pole

00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:36.307
in this series in
the decay rate.

00:41:36.307 --> 00:41:38.140
And those have to cancel
against each other.

00:41:54.660 --> 00:41:59.668
So you should think that there's
a 1 over u minus 1/2 pole

00:41:59.668 --> 00:42:01.460
in the relation of this
thing to the MS bar

00:42:01.460 --> 00:42:03.570
mass that we just computed.

00:42:03.570 --> 00:42:05.240
And one could also
look at, for example,

00:42:05.240 --> 00:42:08.010
bubble chains for this
particular observable.

00:42:08.010 --> 00:42:09.180
People have done that.

00:42:09.180 --> 00:42:11.930
And if we did that, you'd
also find exactly the same,

00:42:11.930 --> 00:42:16.890
u equals 1/2 pole
in that series.

00:42:16.890 --> 00:42:21.060
And these are cancelling if we
make that change of variable

00:42:21.060 --> 00:42:21.560
here.

00:42:36.498 --> 00:42:37.790
I guess I've already said that.

00:42:43.210 --> 00:42:45.370
When you do that--

00:42:45.370 --> 00:42:47.350
in practice of
course, what you do is

00:42:47.350 --> 00:42:49.300
you don't have the whole series.

00:42:49.300 --> 00:42:52.930
So what you do is you want
the cancellation to take place

00:42:52.930 --> 00:42:54.550
at the order you've worked.

00:42:54.550 --> 00:42:57.050
So say I know alpha squared
in this decay rate--

00:42:57.050 --> 00:42:59.530
which is true,
people do know that--

00:42:59.530 --> 00:43:01.210
and the alpha squared relation.

00:43:01.210 --> 00:43:02.710
What you then want
to do is you want

00:43:02.710 --> 00:43:05.562
to make sure that the terms,
any large numerical factors

00:43:05.562 --> 00:43:07.270
in front of the series,
are canceling out

00:43:07.270 --> 00:43:09.640
to order alpha squared.

00:43:09.640 --> 00:43:11.930
And there's only
one little caveat

00:43:11.930 --> 00:43:15.440
which you have to
be careful about,

00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:17.815
and that is that you have to
expand in the same coupling.

00:43:28.750 --> 00:43:33.082
So when we do this
cancellation order by order,

00:43:33.082 --> 00:43:35.665
you should use the same coupling
constant with the same scale.

00:43:40.915 --> 00:43:42.040
So as long as both series--

00:43:55.780 --> 00:43:57.820
so you can't, for
example, make a conversion

00:43:57.820 --> 00:44:00.340
with the M b pole
with alpha s evaluated

00:44:00.340 --> 00:44:01.900
at the b scale or
some other scale.

00:44:01.900 --> 00:44:03.650
You have to really do
it at the same scale

00:44:03.650 --> 00:44:06.610
that whatever this series
is expressed in terms of.

00:44:09.650 --> 00:44:12.800
And you can also think of that
as being related to the fact

00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:16.760
that the Borel variable
u itself was defined

00:44:16.760 --> 00:44:20.080
as the conjugate
variable to something

00:44:20.080 --> 00:44:22.210
that was mu dependent.

00:44:22.210 --> 00:44:26.290
So even the definition
of u involves alpha

00:44:26.290 --> 00:44:27.730
at it's particular scale mu.

00:44:31.460 --> 00:44:32.310
OK.

00:44:32.310 --> 00:44:35.310
So I said that in a bit
of a convoluted way.

00:44:35.310 --> 00:44:38.670
But hopefully what I'm saying is
clear, even if what I'm writing

00:44:38.670 --> 00:44:39.380
is not so clear.

00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:43.060
OK.

00:44:43.060 --> 00:44:48.490
So same coupling in this series
and the conversion series.

00:44:48.490 --> 00:44:51.940
And this, what I've just
said, is also a general fact,

00:44:51.940 --> 00:44:57.287
that these poles are artifacts
of splitting up physics

00:44:57.287 --> 00:44:58.120
at different scales.

00:45:02.260 --> 00:45:04.330
And they will always
be canceling out

00:45:04.330 --> 00:45:05.080
observable things.

00:45:05.080 --> 00:45:10.405
They're remnants of splitting
up physics in particular ways.

00:45:12.910 --> 00:45:14.685
They always cancel
out of observables.

00:45:14.685 --> 00:45:16.810
AUDIENCE: When you say
physics at different scales,

00:45:16.810 --> 00:45:19.240
is that a proxy for
taking a certain infinite

00:45:19.240 --> 00:45:20.188
subset of diagrams--

00:45:20.188 --> 00:45:20.980
IAIN STEWART: Yeah.

00:45:20.980 --> 00:45:23.650
So if you like, we introduced
a cutoff in our diagrams

00:45:23.650 --> 00:45:25.050
when we did them.

00:45:25.050 --> 00:45:25.550
Right.

00:45:25.550 --> 00:45:27.010
AUDIENCE: Like the number of
gluon propagators [INAUDIBLE]??

00:45:27.010 --> 00:45:27.802
IAIN STEWART: Yeah.

00:45:27.802 --> 00:45:28.923
I mean-- right.

00:45:28.923 --> 00:45:30.340
Effectively, you
could think of it

00:45:30.340 --> 00:45:33.390
like that or the
number of bubbles.

00:45:33.390 --> 00:45:34.330
Yeah.

00:45:34.330 --> 00:45:38.930
And that was a proxy that
became this u variable.

00:45:38.930 --> 00:45:41.840
And that was becoming kind
of a probe for the cutoff

00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:43.203
dependence.

00:45:43.203 --> 00:45:44.870
So we'll talk more
about that right now.

00:45:54.340 --> 00:45:55.390
So what is this?

00:45:55.390 --> 00:45:57.015
How should you think
about this cutoff?

00:46:19.340 --> 00:46:23.030
So when we remove the ambiguity,
we actually introduce a scale.

00:46:23.030 --> 00:46:27.990
And the way you can think
of that is as follows--

00:46:27.990 --> 00:46:31.770
you should think
that, in general,

00:46:31.770 --> 00:46:35.510
the relation between the
pole mass and some other mass

00:46:35.510 --> 00:46:41.380
is some infinite
series which has

00:46:41.380 --> 00:46:49.420
the general structure of a
bunch of logarithms perhaps,

00:46:49.420 --> 00:46:55.530
and coupling constants,
and some coefficients.

00:46:55.530 --> 00:46:57.420
So it's a double
series in n and k.

00:46:57.420 --> 00:46:58.980
It starts at order alpha.

00:46:58.980 --> 00:47:02.225
So that's why n is
starting at order one.

00:47:02.225 --> 00:47:04.850
And just because of dimensions--
if this is dimension 1, that's

00:47:04.850 --> 00:47:06.920
dimension 1-- there has to
be something of a dimension 1

00:47:06.920 --> 00:47:07.753
that we stick there.

00:47:07.753 --> 00:47:11.930
And let's be flexible about
we put what we put there

00:47:11.930 --> 00:47:25.990
and call it R.

00:47:25.990 --> 00:47:28.480
So this is a general
scheme conversion formula.

00:47:28.480 --> 00:47:31.780
We can put any kind of
conversion into that form.

00:47:50.990 --> 00:47:58.370
So if we call this
thing here delta m,

00:47:58.370 --> 00:48:01.340
then I can also move it to the
other side and write like this.

00:48:04.350 --> 00:48:08.570
And then, what you can say is
that if I pick my delta m such

00:48:08.570 --> 00:48:13.522
that it's infrared
structure, it's asymptotic

00:48:13.522 --> 00:48:15.230
structured alpha, is
the same as the pole

00:48:15.230 --> 00:48:17.510
mass, I can set up
something where I

00:48:17.510 --> 00:48:52.370
get a renormalon-free mass m R.

00:48:52.370 --> 00:48:54.950
So the pole mass
has this renormalon

00:48:54.950 --> 00:48:56.750
that we've been talking about.

00:48:56.750 --> 00:48:59.390
If I set it up so that
my subtractions also have

00:48:59.390 --> 00:49:02.850
the same kind of structure--

00:49:02.850 --> 00:49:06.380
so for example, with
the example that we did,

00:49:06.380 --> 00:49:09.200
you would need the
nonlogarithmic terms

00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:15.930
to be n factorial 2 to
the n, beta 0 to the n--

00:49:20.710 --> 00:49:24.280
as long as we have the
right terms in the delta m,

00:49:24.280 --> 00:49:29.330
we can construct something
that's free of that renormalon.

00:49:29.330 --> 00:49:32.540
Now, in MS bar,
which is what we did,

00:49:32.540 --> 00:49:38.650
this R scale is just
the MS bar mass itself.

00:49:38.650 --> 00:49:43.450
Which is the running quantity,
but it's evaluated at m bar.

00:49:43.450 --> 00:49:45.280
So the formula that
we get would have

00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:49.210
m pole is equal to m bar plus
m bar times a series in alpha.

00:49:49.210 --> 00:49:50.900
That was the conversion.

00:49:50.900 --> 00:49:53.830
So the scale R was
fixed to be m bar.

00:49:57.523 --> 00:49:59.690
In this scheme that we
talked about last time, which

00:49:59.690 --> 00:50:04.280
is called the 1S scheme,
where we talked about defining

00:50:04.280 --> 00:50:08.360
a scheme by thinking about
two heavy quarks calculating

00:50:08.360 --> 00:50:17.520
corrections between
calculating perturbatively

00:50:17.520 --> 00:50:19.590
the potential between
those heavy quarks

00:50:19.590 --> 00:50:23.610
and defining a mass that way,
that's called the 1S scheme.

00:50:23.610 --> 00:50:27.510
In that particular case,
you get an extra alpha

00:50:27.510 --> 00:50:31.200
that we talked about.

00:50:31.200 --> 00:50:34.290
And the corresponding
R would actually

00:50:34.290 --> 00:50:39.690
be the m 1S mass
times an alpha, which

00:50:39.690 --> 00:50:50.590
is effectively the inverse
Bohr radius for this potential.

00:50:50.590 --> 00:50:52.340
But we can even be
more general than that.

00:50:52.340 --> 00:50:54.800
We can make this R into
just a free parameter.

00:50:54.800 --> 00:51:03.803
We don't have to fix it in the
way that these two schemes do.

00:51:03.803 --> 00:51:05.470
We can think of it
as a floating cutoff.

00:51:15.760 --> 00:51:20.410
And for any R that we
pick, the ambiguity delta m

00:51:20.410 --> 00:51:22.820
will be R independent.

00:51:22.820 --> 00:51:25.420
Just like the m bar was
cancelling out when we picked

00:51:25.420 --> 00:51:27.760
the MS bar scheme, when
you pick the 1S scheme,

00:51:27.760 --> 00:51:28.900
that R cancels out.

00:51:28.900 --> 00:51:34.870
And generically, the ambiguity,
which is just lambda QCD,

00:51:34.870 --> 00:51:41.130
is independent of R.

00:51:41.130 --> 00:51:43.003
So R is really setting a scale.

00:51:43.003 --> 00:51:45.420
So really what you're doing
is you're cancelling something

00:51:45.420 --> 00:51:48.720
that's happening if you like
it in the deep infrared.

00:51:48.720 --> 00:51:51.840
But whenever you
cancel something,

00:51:51.840 --> 00:51:54.420
you have to sort of decide
how much of the leftover

00:51:54.420 --> 00:51:55.260
do you take.

00:51:55.260 --> 00:51:57.780
You're canceling something
at 0, but then you're

00:51:57.780 --> 00:52:00.420
taking something
from 0 to something.

00:52:00.420 --> 00:52:04.830
And that "to something"
is exactly what this R is.

00:52:04.830 --> 00:52:07.810
Just like in dim reg--

00:52:07.810 --> 00:52:10.320
my spelling is atrocious.

00:52:16.560 --> 00:52:19.230
Just like in dim
reg, when you cancel

00:52:19.230 --> 00:52:21.000
the UV pole that's at infinity.

00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:23.050
You have 1 over epsilon
UV, but the mu comes in,

00:52:23.050 --> 00:52:28.030
and the mu is setting kind of a
soft cutoff on your integrals.

00:52:28.030 --> 00:52:31.680
And you think of that as
where you've moved down to.

00:52:31.680 --> 00:52:34.410
In the same way, this
R is kind of saying,

00:52:34.410 --> 00:52:36.600
you're canceling
something at 0, and we

00:52:36.600 --> 00:52:40.500
have to take along with it some
fluctuations up to some scale.

00:52:40.500 --> 00:52:42.805
And R us providing that choice.

00:52:57.650 --> 00:53:03.290
So we take some infrared
fluctuations together

00:53:03.290 --> 00:53:04.240
with the pole mass--

00:53:07.310 --> 00:53:10.820
these are the infrared
fluctuations that were causing

00:53:10.820 --> 00:53:15.140
the [? stability. ?] They are
[? dressing ?] the pole mass,

00:53:15.140 --> 00:53:18.480
if you like, which is like
a point particle mass.

00:53:18.480 --> 00:53:22.910
They're making it into a
kind of [? dressed ?] mass,

00:53:22.910 --> 00:53:25.760
and they're yielding a
well-defined mass parameter

00:53:25.760 --> 00:53:27.080
that then depends on a scale.

00:53:37.110 --> 00:53:39.950
So here's the origin.

00:53:39.950 --> 00:53:43.048
I think that you include
all the fluctuations

00:53:43.048 --> 00:53:44.840
in some sphere around
the origin node to R.

00:53:44.840 --> 00:53:46.257
That's the right
physical picture.

00:54:09.700 --> 00:54:11.470
So the right
physical picture here

00:54:11.470 --> 00:54:14.170
is that when we're
using the MS bar scheme,

00:54:14.170 --> 00:54:16.000
we're ignoring powers.

00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:19.060
And there was actually
an improper separation

00:54:19.060 --> 00:54:22.030
between certain power law terms.

00:54:22.030 --> 00:54:24.070
Those power law terms
that you didn't really

00:54:24.070 --> 00:54:26.150
see very well in
MS bar can be seen

00:54:26.150 --> 00:54:28.720
when you look at the asymptotics
of the perturbation series.

00:54:28.720 --> 00:54:30.773
They come back to haunt you.

00:54:30.773 --> 00:54:33.190
You can look at the asymptotics
of the perturbation series

00:54:33.190 --> 00:54:37.130
using these renormalon
Borel-style techniques.

00:54:37.130 --> 00:54:38.890
And you can figure
out how to define

00:54:38.890 --> 00:54:41.950
masses that are sensitive
to these problems,

00:54:41.950 --> 00:54:43.435
like the MS bar mass.

00:54:43.435 --> 00:54:45.610
The MS bar mass has
too large an r scale

00:54:45.610 --> 00:54:47.740
to be used for b physics.

00:54:47.740 --> 00:54:50.613
The 1S mass is something
that has a small enough scale

00:54:50.613 --> 00:54:52.030
that you can use
it for b physics,

00:54:52.030 --> 00:54:56.050
although it would have potential
problems for top quark physics.

00:54:56.050 --> 00:54:58.210
But you can actually
make the scale

00:54:58.210 --> 00:55:00.250
where you're absorbing
the fluctuations up

00:55:00.250 --> 00:55:02.860
to a free parameter,
and then you're

00:55:02.860 --> 00:55:07.000
good to go with any
physical problem,

00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:11.785
because you can choose it to
be an appropriate scale, much

00:55:11.785 --> 00:55:13.660
like we choose mu to be
an appropriate scale.

00:55:19.330 --> 00:55:22.090
So let me give one
very definite example

00:55:22.090 --> 00:55:28.295
of how you could define
a scheme with this R.

00:55:28.295 --> 00:55:30.670
So we'll build something that's
where we don't have to do

00:55:30.670 --> 00:55:34.078
any additional calculations.

00:55:34.078 --> 00:55:35.620
What we're going to
do is we're going

00:55:35.620 --> 00:55:40.450
to use the MS bar mass,
the MS bar pole scheme

00:55:40.450 --> 00:55:47.760
conversion, and from that we
define the a's that we need.

00:55:50.980 --> 00:55:58.240
We can take mu equal to R so
that the log of mu over R is 0,

00:55:58.240 --> 00:56:01.560
and then we don't need
any of the other a's.

00:56:10.050 --> 00:56:14.160
So then we have a formula
that's a definite thing that

00:56:14.160 --> 00:56:14.910
looks as follows--

00:56:22.780 --> 00:56:26.280
so we're tweaking the MS
bar result, if you like,

00:56:26.280 --> 00:56:31.650
so that instead of
having a fixed scale,

00:56:31.650 --> 00:56:32.880
it has a floating scale.

00:56:38.008 --> 00:56:39.300
So these are the MS bar values.

00:56:42.900 --> 00:56:45.570
And we don't have the MS bar
front, we have an R in front.

00:56:52.500 --> 00:56:55.320
And we have R's in
these couplings.

00:56:55.320 --> 00:56:59.700
And that's a well-defined
scheme called the MSR scheme.

00:56:59.700 --> 00:57:01.320
And in this scheme,
you have a cut off

00:57:01.320 --> 00:57:03.960
R that you can just pick as
a parameter and adjust it.

00:57:03.960 --> 00:57:05.960
It's just a parameter like mu.

00:57:05.960 --> 00:57:07.710
It's part of the
definition of the scheme.

00:57:10.290 --> 00:57:12.570
And so this kind of
change here would

00:57:12.570 --> 00:57:16.020
be good for doing physics.

00:57:16.020 --> 00:57:19.578
This is a good scheme
for doing physics

00:57:19.578 --> 00:57:21.810
where you want to absorb
things up to that cutoff.

00:57:21.810 --> 00:57:28.680
So you can sort of--

00:57:31.320 --> 00:57:31.820
well--

00:57:41.840 --> 00:57:44.140
So if you're
thinking about HQET,

00:57:44.140 --> 00:57:47.920
you can pick the R to
be say a GV freely,

00:57:47.920 --> 00:57:49.660
and it wouldn't care
about whether you're

00:57:49.660 --> 00:57:52.735
talking about a top quark or a
bottom quark or a charm quark.

00:57:52.735 --> 00:57:53.860
It's just a free parameter.

00:57:53.860 --> 00:57:57.430
You can pick it to
be something fixed,

00:57:57.430 --> 00:57:59.800
and it wouldn't depend
on what kind of mass

00:57:59.800 --> 00:58:02.860
you're starting over here with.

00:58:02.860 --> 00:58:05.620
So you're just kind of
decoupling this cutoff

00:58:05.620 --> 00:58:06.790
from the mass itself.

00:58:09.810 --> 00:58:10.310
All right.

00:58:18.650 --> 00:58:19.540
Any questions?

00:58:23.370 --> 00:58:25.740
AUDIENCE: So when you wrote
the series in k that you not

00:58:25.740 --> 00:58:28.000
got rid of with
this choice, that

00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:30.788
was just you being
careful about including--

00:58:30.788 --> 00:58:31.830
IAIN STEWART: Everything.

00:58:31.830 --> 00:58:32.690
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:58:32.690 --> 00:58:33.482
IAIN STEWART: Yeah.

00:58:33.482 --> 00:58:35.490
I mean, I was just being
careful about including

00:58:35.490 --> 00:58:37.490
all the kind of things
that in principle I

00:58:37.490 --> 00:58:41.160
could see in any arbitrary
choice of scheme change.

00:58:41.160 --> 00:58:42.660
And in any arbitrary
choice, there's

00:58:42.660 --> 00:58:44.370
both mu, which we defined--

00:58:44.370 --> 00:58:46.320
that was related to the alpha--

00:58:46.320 --> 00:58:48.030
and there was this R showing up.

00:58:48.030 --> 00:58:51.300
And we got logs of mu
over R. And in MS bar,

00:58:51.300 --> 00:58:55.680
the R was in bar, but you still
had mu showing up as well.

00:58:55.680 --> 00:59:01.170
And mu is related to the
running of the MS bar mass.

00:59:01.170 --> 00:59:04.020
But in general, the fact
that you have both mu and R

00:59:04.020 --> 00:59:05.370
is kind of--

00:59:05.370 --> 00:59:06.660
they were separate.

00:59:06.660 --> 00:59:09.000
Because you define mu
for the log cutoffs.

00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:11.880
And you defined R here for
the power log cutoffs--

00:59:11.880 --> 00:59:13.515
the power log divergences.

00:59:13.515 --> 00:59:15.390
At the end of the day,
you might as well just

00:59:15.390 --> 00:59:16.900
take those cutoffs
to be the same.

00:59:16.900 --> 00:59:18.483
And that's what I
just did-- mu equals

00:59:18.483 --> 00:59:22.608
R. That gets rid of the logs.

00:59:22.608 --> 00:59:24.850
AUDIENCE: Do people
worry about u equals 1?

00:59:24.850 --> 00:59:26.850
IAIN STEWART: Yeah, you
can worry about u equals

00:59:26.850 --> 00:59:30.000
1. u equals 1/2 is the first
thing you should worry about.

00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:32.310
If you want to go to
u equals 1, then you

00:59:32.310 --> 00:59:34.830
need problems that have
kind of more information

00:59:34.830 --> 00:59:36.032
in perturbation theory.

00:59:36.032 --> 00:59:37.740
So if you just have
two loop information,

00:59:37.740 --> 00:59:40.800
u equals 1/2 is
usually perfectly fine.

00:59:40.800 --> 00:59:43.140
If you have four
loop information,

00:59:43.140 --> 00:59:46.710
you probably should start
worrying about u equals 1.

00:59:46.710 --> 00:59:47.870
That's just kind of rough.

00:59:52.160 --> 00:59:53.615
So people don't
often talk about u

00:59:53.615 --> 00:59:55.700
equals 1, though
sometimes they do.

01:00:00.450 --> 01:00:00.950
OK.

01:00:00.950 --> 01:00:03.740
So I need a little
aside here in order

01:00:03.740 --> 01:00:08.970
to proceed with what I
want to talk about next.

01:00:08.970 --> 01:00:12.020
And that is I just want
to define for you how

01:00:12.020 --> 01:00:14.690
you would define lambda QCD at
higher orders of perturbation

01:00:14.690 --> 01:00:16.130
theory.

01:00:16.130 --> 01:00:20.420
So the formula we used a
minute ago was leading log,

01:00:20.420 --> 01:00:24.422
but we can define lambda QCD
even if we go to higher orders.

01:00:24.422 --> 01:00:26.630
And I just want to do a
little bit of algebra, set up

01:00:26.630 --> 01:00:29.720
some of the notation in order
to define this thing at higher

01:00:29.720 --> 01:00:31.650
orders.

01:00:31.650 --> 01:00:35.263
So MS bar beta function--

01:00:42.840 --> 01:00:48.960
and we're going to just
work to all orders formally.

01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:52.853
And we'll see that we can
construct a solution where it's

01:00:52.853 --> 01:00:55.020
kind of obvious how you
would work to whatever order

01:00:55.020 --> 01:00:55.950
you want to work.

01:01:00.730 --> 01:01:02.580
So let's just
parameterize the series,

01:01:02.580 --> 01:01:04.920
even if we don't
know all the terms.

01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:06.510
We only up to beta 4.

01:01:06.510 --> 01:01:09.060
But let's parameterize the
series as a bunch of betas.

01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:24.610
I'm going to call the
cutoff R, because we've

01:01:24.610 --> 01:01:25.610
started calling it that.

01:01:25.610 --> 01:01:27.730
But I could call it mu.

01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:39.430
I just took mu equal to
R. So I can rearrange

01:01:39.430 --> 01:01:42.370
that equation in this way--

01:01:42.370 --> 01:01:46.540
I can write it as dR over R
is equal to d alpha over beta.

01:01:46.540 --> 01:01:49.720
And then I can integrate on
both sides between two values.

01:01:49.720 --> 01:01:52.147
And on this integral,
it's just giving me a log.

01:01:52.147 --> 01:01:54.355
This integral, it's giving
me an integral over alpha.

01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:17.770
So what I'm going
to want to do here

01:02:17.770 --> 01:02:20.480
is make a change of variables.

01:02:20.480 --> 01:02:23.880
And we'll see the following
change of intervals convenient.

01:02:29.170 --> 01:02:31.690
I'm going to make a change of
variables in the integration

01:02:31.690 --> 01:02:34.540
to this t.

01:02:34.540 --> 01:02:37.450
So I have some dummy variable
that I'm integrating over.

01:02:37.450 --> 01:02:40.450
Let's change the
dummy variable t.

01:02:40.450 --> 01:02:44.230
And basically that's going
to simplify the lowest order

01:02:44.230 --> 01:02:47.260
result.

01:02:47.260 --> 01:02:52.030
Because the lowest order result
d alpha over beta of alpha,

01:02:52.030 --> 01:02:54.877
well, the beta goes like
alpha squared at lowest order.

01:02:54.877 --> 01:02:56.710
So I'm basically making
a change of variable

01:02:56.710 --> 01:03:01.043
where this d alpha over beta at
lowest order will just be DT.

01:03:01.043 --> 01:03:01.960
That's what I'm doing.

01:03:08.865 --> 01:03:10.910
I have to change variables
in the limits as well.

01:03:17.180 --> 01:03:42.960
So I call those t1 and
t0 and change variables

01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:44.593
consistently everywhere.

01:03:52.980 --> 01:04:04.870
And if I do that, this is the
kind of form of the result.

01:04:04.870 --> 01:04:07.020
So this is just a Laurent
series in 1 over t.

01:04:15.540 --> 01:04:25.330
And the first term, we had
d alpha over minus beta 0

01:04:25.330 --> 01:04:28.180
over 2 pi alpha squared.

01:04:28.180 --> 01:04:31.000
And that was just minus dt.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.760
So the reason that
this thing here is 1

01:04:33.760 --> 01:04:35.770
is because my change
of variable with dt

01:04:35.770 --> 01:04:38.320
was exactly taking into
account all the factors

01:04:38.320 --> 01:04:40.353
to basically just
make it into a 1.

01:04:40.353 --> 01:04:42.520
And there's a sign change,
but I flipped the limits.

01:04:46.908 --> 01:04:48.700
So we made the first
term trivial, and then

01:04:48.700 --> 01:04:50.110
the higher terms of these terms.

01:04:50.110 --> 01:04:54.933
And these b hats we could
figure out what they are.

01:04:54.933 --> 01:04:57.100
And they're just combinations
of the beta functions.

01:05:09.520 --> 01:05:13.110
So once we expand
the 1 over beta,

01:05:13.110 --> 01:05:16.610
we get various
combinations of things.

01:05:16.610 --> 01:05:17.700
I think I won't write b3.

01:05:23.420 --> 01:05:26.900
We could also do the integral--

01:05:26.900 --> 01:05:29.930
pretty easy integral to do.

01:05:29.930 --> 01:05:32.210
And so if you want to
write a solution for what

01:05:32.210 --> 01:05:34.290
the integral is, you
could say, well, it's

01:05:34.290 --> 01:05:36.920
some function that
you get from doing

01:05:36.920 --> 01:05:39.500
the indefinite
integral evaluated

01:05:39.500 --> 01:05:42.500
at the upper limit minus that
function evaluated at the lower

01:05:42.500 --> 01:05:45.110
limit.

01:05:45.110 --> 01:05:50.610
And G is just that function.

01:05:50.610 --> 01:05:52.880
So doing the integral
of 1 gives t.

01:05:55.598 --> 01:05:57.140
Doing the integral
of the other time,

01:05:57.140 --> 01:06:00.410
and being careful about what's
positive and what's negative,

01:06:00.410 --> 01:06:02.240
I can write as log of minus t.

01:06:09.610 --> 01:06:12.707
So t was negative.

01:06:12.707 --> 01:06:14.290
And if you look at
my definition of t,

01:06:14.290 --> 01:06:17.210
it had a minus sign in it.

01:06:17.210 --> 01:06:19.060
So this log is a
logical positive number.

01:06:24.140 --> 01:06:28.550
So we have this G of t and
G prime of t is just b hat.

01:06:32.370 --> 01:06:33.840
And if we write a formula--

01:06:33.840 --> 01:06:36.007
which is not what we're
actually interested in here,

01:06:36.007 --> 01:06:38.390
but we might as well
write it anyway--

01:06:38.390 --> 01:06:41.230
it's this way.

01:06:41.230 --> 01:06:44.825
Just taking that formula
and writing it this way,

01:06:44.825 --> 01:06:46.700
then if you think about
what this formula is,

01:06:46.700 --> 01:06:50.000
it's an all orders relation
between the coupling

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:51.830
at one scale and the
coupling at another.

01:06:55.712 --> 01:06:57.170
It's a formal
relation, because you

01:06:57.170 --> 01:07:00.200
need to know the coefficients.

01:07:00.200 --> 01:07:02.180
But if someone tells
you the coefficients,

01:07:02.180 --> 01:07:03.680
you can plug them
into this formula.

01:07:11.860 --> 01:07:14.860
And this is the extension
of the usual running formula

01:07:14.860 --> 01:07:17.560
that you would write down
for relating alpha at one

01:07:17.560 --> 01:07:18.910
scale to alpha at another scale.

01:07:18.910 --> 01:07:21.535
This is a generalization
that includes higher order

01:07:21.535 --> 01:07:22.660
terms in the beta function.

01:07:30.535 --> 01:07:31.910
So the other thing
that we can do

01:07:31.910 --> 01:07:35.630
is we can rearrange the formula
and take account of the fact

01:07:35.630 --> 01:07:39.500
that we have R1's and R0's,
and we can make it such

01:07:39.500 --> 01:07:42.590
that we have only R1's on
one side of the formula

01:07:42.590 --> 01:07:46.520
and R0's on the other
side of the formula

01:07:46.520 --> 01:07:48.140
by splitting the
log into two pieces.

01:07:51.170 --> 01:07:55.600
And that's what you do
to define lambda QCD.

01:07:55.600 --> 01:07:58.390
So we can rearrange
it as follows--

01:07:58.390 --> 01:07:59.245
taking an exponent.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:10.560
So now we only have our R0's in
this part, R1's in that part.

01:08:10.560 --> 01:08:13.750
This thing has to be independent
of the choice of the R,

01:08:13.750 --> 01:08:16.680
and that's just this
constant lambda QCD.

01:08:16.680 --> 01:08:18.899
And that's the generalization
of this definition

01:08:18.899 --> 01:08:20.660
of lambda QCD that
we had before,

01:08:20.660 --> 01:08:25.873
where it was R0 e to the
minus 2 pi over beta 0 alpha.

01:08:25.873 --> 01:08:27.540
Now we have the higher
terms that I just

01:08:27.540 --> 01:08:28.890
decoded in this G function.

01:08:36.470 --> 01:08:42.189
So if you didn't remember that
formula for the lambda QCD,

01:08:42.189 --> 01:08:43.240
now we've derived it.

01:08:47.170 --> 01:08:51.170
And we included the higher
order terms as well.

01:08:51.170 --> 01:08:57.180
So the next term would be this.

01:08:57.180 --> 01:09:00.060
[INAUDIBLE] higher order terms.

01:09:00.060 --> 01:09:02.970
And usually you call this
the leading log expression

01:09:02.970 --> 01:09:06.630
for lambda QCD, with the
next leading log once you

01:09:06.630 --> 01:09:07.850
include that term, et cetera.

01:09:11.550 --> 01:09:13.710
But the whole combination
is mu independent.

01:09:13.710 --> 01:09:16.770
The mu independence of this term
is only cancelling to leading

01:09:16.770 --> 01:09:18.600
log.

01:09:18.600 --> 01:09:22.720
Once you include this term, it's
cancelling to next leading log.

01:09:22.720 --> 01:09:24.960
The whole thing
is mu independent,

01:09:24.960 --> 01:09:27.840
getting this from lambda QCD.

01:09:27.840 --> 01:09:30.970
So that's end of the aside.

01:09:30.970 --> 01:09:33.240
So what I actually
want to do is I

01:09:33.240 --> 01:09:36.420
want to come back to our
definition of this MS bar mass,

01:09:36.420 --> 01:09:38.460
and I want to treat
it as if we have--

01:09:38.460 --> 01:09:40.950
I want to think
about it like an RG.

01:09:40.950 --> 01:09:42.180
We have this cutoff.

01:09:42.180 --> 01:09:45.090
Let's see if we can write
down an renormalization group

01:09:45.090 --> 01:09:46.859
equation for that mass.

01:09:46.859 --> 01:09:48.218
It has a cutoff--

01:09:48.218 --> 01:09:50.010
there should be some
equation that tells us

01:09:50.010 --> 01:09:51.180
how to flow in that cutoff.

01:09:51.180 --> 01:09:52.763
Let's see what we
can learn from that.

01:09:55.705 --> 01:09:57.560
So that's end of aside.

01:10:09.160 --> 01:10:21.070
So we have a cutoff,
and we already

01:10:21.070 --> 01:10:23.140
said that we can treat
R as a variable that

01:10:23.140 --> 01:10:24.610
parameterizes the mass scheme.

01:10:37.430 --> 01:10:42.500
And so we can vary R
in this MSR scheme,

01:10:42.500 --> 01:10:45.140
just like we varied u
in the MS bar scheme.

01:10:55.163 --> 01:10:56.580
So, if you like,
what you're doing

01:10:56.580 --> 01:10:58.247
when you're vary mu
in the MS bar scheme

01:10:58.247 --> 01:11:00.390
is you're properly taking
into account kind of what

01:11:00.390 --> 01:11:02.190
fluctuations you want
to put into your mass

01:11:02.190 --> 01:11:04.230
in the ultraviolet.

01:11:04.230 --> 01:11:07.860
And here it's related to
this kind of physics that's

01:11:07.860 --> 01:11:12.817
going on in the deep
infrared that you're also

01:11:12.817 --> 01:11:13.650
being careful about.

01:11:18.030 --> 01:11:23.880
So we'll have instead of a
mu RGE we'll have an R RGE.

01:11:23.880 --> 01:11:25.950
The difference between
the mu RGE and the R RGE

01:11:25.950 --> 01:11:29.010
is this time we're
talking about powers.

01:11:29.010 --> 01:11:30.765
We'll see what happens.

01:11:35.720 --> 01:11:39.850
So M pole didn't depend on
R. So you get 0 for that.

01:11:39.850 --> 01:11:42.960
And if we just look at
our scheme change formula,

01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:46.440
then we can figure
out what the RGE is.

01:11:56.210 --> 01:12:01.580
This delta M was a function of
R. And we can define this as R,

01:12:01.580 --> 01:12:03.923
to get the dimensions
right, times some kind

01:12:03.923 --> 01:12:06.215
of anomalous dimension that's
just a function of alpha.

01:12:28.850 --> 01:12:32.740
So what this guy would look
like is again just a series--

01:12:48.873 --> 01:12:49.915
some perturbative series.

01:12:52.830 --> 01:13:02.436
RGE is writing out our equation.

01:13:02.436 --> 01:13:06.049
The equation we've
come to is this.

01:13:10.540 --> 01:13:14.500
So R d by dR of the
mass, because of the fact

01:13:14.500 --> 01:13:16.780
that we're dealing
with a power, we

01:13:16.780 --> 01:13:19.130
get an R on the right-hand
side of this equation.

01:13:19.130 --> 01:13:20.950
And that's really
the only thing that's

01:13:20.950 --> 01:13:24.280
causing a difference from
this kind of standard RGE's

01:13:24.280 --> 01:13:25.390
that we've solved so far.

01:13:29.930 --> 01:13:32.330
And the fact that we got
this power, which was 1,

01:13:32.330 --> 01:13:34.295
is exactly related to
the fact that it was a u

01:13:34.295 --> 01:13:35.750
equals 1/2 renormalon.

01:13:35.750 --> 01:13:38.300
If we looked at the renormalons
that are further out,

01:13:38.300 --> 01:13:42.450
like u equals 1
would give R squared.

01:13:42.450 --> 01:13:45.260
We haven't seen really enough to
identify that, but that's true.

01:13:47.830 --> 01:13:54.770
So let's solve this
guy in the usual way.

01:14:13.725 --> 01:14:14.725
Integrate on both sides.

01:14:26.230 --> 01:14:30.250
From what we just talked about,
R is equal to lambda QCD e

01:14:30.250 --> 01:14:33.860
to the minus G of t.

01:14:33.860 --> 01:14:36.550
And we can also
therefore write that d

01:14:36.550 --> 01:14:44.280
log R is, from this formula.
dt minus G prime of t.

01:14:44.280 --> 01:14:46.780
If we follow that through as
a change of variable, that's

01:14:46.780 --> 01:14:48.400
the change of variable we get.

01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:50.570
So let's switch
variable from R to dt.

01:14:53.090 --> 01:14:57.080
So d log R is the
product of these things,

01:14:57.080 --> 01:15:02.000
and I can write it actually
kind of a compact way

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:14.477
if I write it is lambda QCD dt d
by dt of e to the minus G of t.

01:15:14.477 --> 01:15:16.060
So we've got a G
prime, and then we've

01:15:16.060 --> 01:15:17.423
got an e to the minus G of t.

01:15:17.423 --> 01:15:19.590
Let's just write that as a
total derivative of that.

01:15:44.180 --> 01:15:47.860
So if I write it in terms of
t, then that's the solution.

01:15:47.860 --> 01:15:50.530
That's the formal
solution in terms of--

01:15:50.530 --> 01:15:53.590
and I switched variable also
in the anomalous dimension.

01:15:53.590 --> 01:15:58.500
And that's the formal
solution to the RGE.

01:15:58.500 --> 01:16:01.923
And this is a
well-defined integral.

01:16:01.923 --> 01:16:03.340
There's no problems
with doing it.

01:16:06.980 --> 01:16:09.050
The place where the
integral could start

01:16:09.050 --> 01:16:10.790
causing problems is t equals 0.

01:16:10.790 --> 01:16:12.440
But we're never
getting to t equals 0.

01:16:12.440 --> 01:16:14.815
We have cutoffs that are
keeping us away from t equals 0.

01:16:25.640 --> 01:16:27.350
So it shouldn't
surprise you that it's

01:16:27.350 --> 01:16:30.170
a well-defined integral, because
we said that these things are

01:16:30.170 --> 01:16:33.110
supposed to be well
defined in masses

01:16:33.110 --> 01:16:35.883
that are not sensitive to
these renormalon problems.

01:16:35.883 --> 01:16:37.550
And taking the
difference of two of them

01:16:37.550 --> 01:16:40.280
should again give
us something that's

01:16:40.280 --> 01:16:42.030
not sensitive to
renormalon problems.

01:16:42.030 --> 01:16:47.060
But it's interesting that you
see lambda QCD popping out.

01:16:47.060 --> 01:16:49.580
And that's because these two
masses and the difference

01:16:49.580 --> 01:16:51.620
of these cutoffs is
related to absorbing

01:16:51.620 --> 01:16:54.470
a different amount of
these fluctuations which

01:16:54.470 --> 01:16:57.470
were related to lambda QCD.

01:17:32.760 --> 01:17:38.430
So the evolution would just
yield a new well-defined mass

01:17:38.430 --> 01:17:44.070
of R1, which absorbs a different
amount of IR fluctuations--

01:17:50.630 --> 01:17:54.050
a shell out to R1 instead of
just out to R0 if you like.

01:18:06.760 --> 01:18:09.370
So you're absorbing those
fluctuations together with them

01:18:09.370 --> 01:18:12.760
M pole to get
something well defined.

01:18:12.760 --> 01:18:15.910
And how much you absorb
is related to this cutoff.

01:18:19.630 --> 01:18:22.720
So we could do that integral
at whatever order we decide.

01:18:22.720 --> 01:18:24.100
Let's just do it at leading log.

01:18:31.770 --> 01:18:35.870
So at leading log,
we take this guy

01:18:35.870 --> 01:18:43.190
and we just take the first term,
some constant, alpha over 4 pi.

01:18:43.190 --> 01:18:48.470
And so gamma R of t,
switching variables,

01:18:48.470 --> 01:18:50.810
becomes that constant
over 2 beta 0

01:18:50.810 --> 01:18:53.870
if we keep all the factors.

01:18:53.870 --> 01:18:55.460
And then a 1 over t--

01:18:55.460 --> 01:18:56.810
alpha comes 1 over t.

01:19:08.148 --> 01:19:09.940
So if we're at leading
log, we should think

01:19:09.940 --> 01:19:11.470
about having the leading log--

01:19:11.470 --> 01:19:13.240
we'll have the QCD.

01:19:13.240 --> 01:19:15.832
So that's what the 0 means--

01:19:15.832 --> 01:19:18.540
there's this factor.

01:19:18.540 --> 01:19:24.800
And the integral we'd have
to do would be this one,

01:19:24.800 --> 01:19:27.458
e to the minus t over t.

01:19:27.458 --> 01:19:30.000
So you see that t equals 0 is
where there could be a problem.

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.070
But away from t equals
0, there's no problem.

01:19:41.220 --> 01:19:45.060
If you do that integral, it
gives you an incomplete gamma

01:19:45.060 --> 01:19:46.453
function.

01:19:46.453 --> 01:19:48.120
That's just a way of
saying that there's

01:19:48.120 --> 01:19:50.370
a special function that's
defined to be that integral.

01:19:55.530 --> 01:19:57.215
Mathematica knows all about it.

01:19:57.215 --> 01:19:58.250
It's very useful.

01:20:04.638 --> 01:20:06.430
And actually, the
incomplete gamma function

01:20:06.430 --> 01:20:11.990
is an example of a function that
has an asymptotic expansion.

01:20:11.990 --> 01:20:16.540
So if we look at what happens if
I expand this incomplete gamma

01:20:16.540 --> 01:20:18.980
function in alpha, t,
Remember, is 1 over alpha.

01:20:18.980 --> 01:20:21.190
It can expand about alpha.

01:20:21.190 --> 01:20:26.090
Then it has a series that
has factorial growth.

01:20:26.090 --> 01:20:27.370
Let me just write that.

01:20:41.410 --> 01:20:43.870
So expanding about alpha
equals 0 is expanding about t

01:20:43.870 --> 01:20:45.108
equals infinity.

01:21:02.220 --> 01:21:09.160
And the gamma function actually
has an asymptotic expansion.

01:21:09.160 --> 01:21:15.480
And if you just work it out,
plug it into Mathematica--

01:21:15.480 --> 01:21:17.710
it's a Taylor series--

01:21:17.710 --> 01:21:24.190
look at the terms, and
you exactly see this--

01:21:24.190 --> 01:21:28.840
2 to the n n factorial, which
is a u equals 1/2 renormalon.

01:21:36.582 --> 01:21:38.040
And so what's
happening is when you

01:21:38.040 --> 01:21:41.220
take the difference of
two of these gammas,

01:21:41.220 --> 01:21:42.968
you're converting this
asymptotic series.

01:21:42.968 --> 01:21:45.510
If you take the difference of
two of these asymptotic series,

01:21:45.510 --> 01:21:48.070
you're converting it
into a convergent series.

01:21:48.070 --> 01:21:50.320
And we'll talk a little bit
more about that next time,

01:21:50.320 --> 01:21:51.153
but I'll stop there.

01:21:53.650 --> 01:21:56.830
So we can see, from this
renormalization group,

01:21:56.830 --> 01:22:00.130
again the renormalon, and
we can see in what way

01:22:00.130 --> 01:22:02.320
it's sort of solved by
thinking about making

01:22:02.320 --> 01:22:04.190
it shift from here to here.

01:22:04.190 --> 01:22:06.190
Because it's the difference
of these two gammas,

01:22:06.190 --> 01:22:08.720
not one of them individually.

01:22:08.720 --> 01:22:10.630
So we can use normalization
group techniques

01:22:10.630 --> 01:22:13.450
to think about these
renormalon effects.

01:22:13.450 --> 01:22:15.700
And we'll talk a little bit
more about that next time.

01:22:20.570 --> 01:22:23.802
AUDIENCE: So is this a
convergent series now?

01:22:23.802 --> 01:22:26.260
IAIN STEWART: The difference
of these is convergent series.

01:22:26.260 --> 01:22:28.600
Yeah.

01:22:28.600 --> 01:22:31.502
I'll write that down next
time and show you it.

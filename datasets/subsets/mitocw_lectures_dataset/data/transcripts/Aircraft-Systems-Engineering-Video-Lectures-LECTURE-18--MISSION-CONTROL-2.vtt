00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:10.790
It was quite an experience for all of us to
get to hear him.

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:17.790
And it is equally very fortunate now to have
Wayne Hale who has had a very illustrious

00:00:19.759 --> 00:00:20.790
career at NASA.

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:27.790
Wayne came to NASA the same year I did in
1978, worked his way up as an engineer through

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.409
the propulsion system, the integrated communication
systems.

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:38.210
Became a flight director in 1988 and served
there for 15 years.

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:45.210
He was flight director both for the orbit
phase and then the most really kind of intense

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.490
flight control phase as ascent and entry.

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:56.650
And Wayne was ascent and entry flight director
and then lead flight director for many flights,

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:59.440
including-- we were trying to figure out before.

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.049
But I think he actually served for all of
my last four flights.

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.250
So we've known each other for a long time.

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:13.010
In 2003, he was sent to the Kennedy Space
Center to be head of launch operations.

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:17.170
But he didn't get to spend very much time
in the Florida sunshine because they asked

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:24.170
him to come back to Houston the next year
as deputy program manager for the Space Shuttle.

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:31.400
And then, when Bill Gerstenmeyer left to move
up to NASA headquarters, Wayne became the

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:32.549
program manager.

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:39.549
So he is able to talk to us both about Mission
Control operations and the current and future

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.710
state of affairs of the Shuttle.

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:49.280
And he is very happy to have you ask questions
while he is talking.

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.799
And I am not going to talk anymore because
they came to hear you, Wayne.

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:53.520
WAYNE: Thank you, Jeff.

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.990
I cannot tell you how much I've been looking
forward to coming here to talk to you folks.

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:00.990
This is my favorite subject.

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.720
Space, number one.

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:04.479
The Shuttle, number two.

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:06.330
And Mission Control, number three.

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:11.540
Maybe not exactly in that order, but they
are all three topics that have been--

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.720
[NOISE OBSCURES]

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.430
Oh, that was you.

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:16.529
I thought that was me.

00:02:16.529 --> 00:02:20.480
I thought that's a sound I haven't heard before
and I'm in big trouble.

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:21.469
OK.

00:02:21.469 --> 00:02:27.109
But, as Jeff said, please feel free to ask
any questions.

00:02:27.109 --> 00:02:31.200
I will tell you all kinds of interesting stories
today, I think.

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.299
Some of them might even be about Dr. Hoffman.

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:38.519
I should tell you my background as an engineer.

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:43.689
I got my bachelor's and master's degree in
mechanical engineering.

00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:48.840
Did not decide to pursue a doctorate degree
for a variety of reasons.

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.999
You need to understand that the organization
of NASA is very much around the centers.

00:02:53.999 --> 00:03:00.999
It was organized as a group largely of independent
centers with a very thin veneer of integration

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:05.299
at NASA headquarters.

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:06.689
And it remains that way to this day.

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:10.249
And every center is quite different from every
other center.

00:03:10.249 --> 00:03:13.419
We have some centers that are largely involved
in research.

00:03:13.419 --> 00:03:20.419
And, if you want to work in the research center,
Langley, Glenn, Ames then you need to clearly

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:24.090
pursue a PhD.

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:31.090
If you're more interested in an ops center,
Kennedy, Marshall, Johnson, then you need

00:03:31.719 --> 00:03:34.969
to kind of not go after the PhD.

00:03:34.969 --> 00:03:41.099
Because people with PhDs clearly do not have
a real world practical understanding of problems.

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:45.529
And it is only the guys with bachelor's degrees
that get out and know how to turn wrenches

00:03:45.529 --> 00:03:48.430
in their spare time required there.

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.739
So it is very interesting, the different cultures.

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:55.269
I can say that with a grin because there are
different cultures within NASA.

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:57.879
And working between the centers is very interesting.

00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:04.879
And since I have moved in the management ranks,
for what reason I don't understand, I have

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:08.749
fouled up in my career.

00:04:08.749 --> 00:04:09.329
[OVERLAPPING VOICES]

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:12.650
make you a manager when you don't get to do
the things that you're good at anymore.

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:17.459
Yes, promote you something that you were never
trained for.

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:22.870
It has been very interesting for me to try
to work between the various centers to help

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:27.150
them accomplish the goals that the agency
has.

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:33.810
One of the things I should say is that I regret
my academic career as I didn't take more psychology,

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:35.600
more accounting.

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:41.370
Because, frankly, when I was in graduate school,
I can remember one of the courses I had was

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.720
systems of nonlinear partial differential
equations.

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:48.409
Anybody taken a class that has a title vaguely
similar to that?

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:50.350
I never used that class.

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:55.159
I have never touched a differential equation
in my professional career.

00:04:55.159 --> 00:04:57.770
Now, why that is, is kind of interesting.

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:02.370
But what I really did need was trigonometry
and accounting.

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:05.340
And you will see a little bit of that.

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:08.310
Today my class is not going to be highly technical.

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:13.320
It is going to be a series of illustrations
about Mission Control.

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:15.880
And, as I said, I will be happy to talk to
you about it.

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:22.880
I go to a lot of conferences these days, and
I frequently sit in advanced space systems

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:24.550
sessions.

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:31.550
I sat in a very interesting future reusable
launch vehicle session the last AIAA conference

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:34.330
I went to.

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:40.000
And I walked away totally distressed because
they have no concept of what the real world

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.140
is like in many of these academic seminars.

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:50.140
And I want to inject a little bit of real
world realism into what you guys think about

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:52.080
as engineers.

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:59.080
One of the favorite topics of people these
days that are designing advanced space systems

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:02.890
include what they call and "austere" launch
pad.

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:08.000
In other words, you cannot fix anything on
the rocket when it is on the launch pad.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.740
And the reason they side is look how much
money all these programs spend fixing their

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:16.330
rocket out on the launch pad.

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:22.250
Well, the fact of the matter is rockets are
very finicky, rockets have very little margin

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:24.670
in many of their components and things break.

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:30.260
They can break and you don't even know it
until you plug them all together and turn

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:30.900
them on.

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:37.900
And if you have a launch pad that is austere
and you can do no work on it, well, what was

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:42.220
one of those colorful phrases that Chris Kraft
would use?

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:44.360
You have really bought the farm.

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:49.250
I won't use his colorful phrases.

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:54.630
You wind up spending a lot more money because
you've got to take the rocket back to the

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:58.680
barn and take it all apart rather than maybe
get access to fix it.

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:02.320
If there was anything that I wish we had was
more capability to fix things on the launch

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:02.880
pad.

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:07.740
We spend a lot of time and money working around
problems that we cannot fix at the launch

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:10.030
pad, even though we have a huge amount of
capability.

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:11.180
You don't save money there.

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:13.430
It is a false economy.

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:18.720
Similarly, there is a notion en vogue that
you don't need a big Mission Control.

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:24.100
That is just a lot of people that cost a lot
of money that you don't really need.

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:31.100
I think it reached the height of the anti
Mission Control forces during the DCX program

00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:36.780
when they were very proud to proclaim their
Mission Control was a trailer house with three

00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:38.070
people in it.

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:41.720
And they thought that was all any space vehicle
needed to have to launch.

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:45.940
Of course, they only reached an altitude to
5000 feet and they crashed their only prototype

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:52.159
vehicle, not because of Mission Control but
perhaps because they didn't pay enough attention

00:07:52.159 --> 00:07:54.020
to operational situations.

00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:59.520
In my business now, I can tell you that in
the Space Shuttle program Mission Control

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:04.139
cost me less than 2% of the total budget for
the Space Shuttle program.

00:08:04.139 --> 00:08:07.150
What we get for that 2% is quite amazing.

00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:14.150
And every time the budget folks come down
from Washington to review our budget, they

00:08:14.889 --> 00:08:20.750
want to help us drive down the ops cost, they
take one look, you have the budget breakdown

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:24.060
of the Shuttle program and they say you guys
don't spend very much on ops.

00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:27.010
This is not where we need to look if we want
to save some money.

00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:31.060
If you want to save some money, you need to
make a reusable vehicle.

00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:36.570
Reusable and not so maintenance intensive
to turn it around.

00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:38.750
And that may be a theme that you hear today.

00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:43.578
I've got a couple of things I want to pass
out to get started, a couple of glossy brochures.

00:08:43.578 --> 00:08:49.350
I think there are enough of these for everyone
about Mission Control.

00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:53.430
People in the class should get first dibs
at this, but hopefully there are enough to

00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:54.269
go around.

00:08:54.269 --> 00:08:55.740
I think there are plenty of these.

00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:59.839
And the little one is similar to the big one.

00:08:59.839 --> 00:09:01.170
And I'm not going to spend a lot of time.

00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:06.529
If you want to know about how Mission Control
Room is laid out and who the people are that

00:09:06.529 --> 00:09:08.100
do things, it's all in this brochure.

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:09.300
I don't intend to go over that.

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:14.449
I think Chris Kraft probably gave you a good
background about why do we have a Mission

00:09:14.449 --> 00:09:15.029
Control.

00:09:15.029 --> 00:09:19.559
Why did he invent a Mission Control?

00:09:19.559 --> 00:09:22.920
And this is kind of the nuts and bolts of
Mission Control as it exists today.

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:27.769
Public Affairs Office is really good about
putting those things together, and I don't

00:09:27.769 --> 00:09:29.209
intend to cover them.

00:09:29.209 --> 00:09:33.300
Also because I had a whole bunch of copies
of my last two papers sitting around that

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:36.089
I needed to get rid of, I lugged them up here.

00:09:36.089 --> 00:09:42.249
I want to give you copies of my last two papers
which have to do with operational issues that

00:09:42.249 --> 00:09:43.499
you can read at your leisure.

00:09:43.499 --> 00:09:48.069
And I particularly want you to look at the
considerations in rendezvous launch windows.

00:09:48.069 --> 00:09:51.550
Those are two different papers.

00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:58.550
One discussing entry operational considerations
and hypersonic entry that we've learned with

00:09:59.579 --> 00:10:00.259
the Space Shuttle.

00:10:00.259 --> 00:10:02.230
The other about rendezvous launch windows.

00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:05.949
And it will give you a little flavor for what
a real operation needs.

00:10:05.949 --> 00:10:10.850
Many people can talk to you about the physics,
kind of the things that God says you must

00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:14.569
do if you are going to rendezvous in space,
for example.

00:10:14.569 --> 00:10:18.990
But there are many other considerations that
you run into in the real world.

00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:22.430
So I am going to talk today mostly about Mission
Control.

00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:25.980
Perhaps at the end we can talk a little bit
about the Shuttle program.

00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:32.980
And these I am short of so, please, people
in the class only as my handout for the slides

00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:39.119
here today.

00:10:39.119 --> 00:10:42.119
And the slides will be posted on the Web as
well.

00:10:42.119 --> 00:10:43.119
Yes.

00:10:43.119 --> 00:10:43.680
Dr.

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:46.939
Hoffman has got them off my electronics here.

00:10:46.939 --> 00:10:51.249
OK, so the things I am going to talk about
today basically are outlines on this page.

00:10:51.249 --> 00:10:52.509
We have a Mission Control.

00:10:52.509 --> 00:10:55.740
Here are some of the reasons we are going
to talk about trajectory.

00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:59.259
Planning and monitoring flight planning.

00:10:59.259 --> 00:10:59.949
Systems engineering.

00:10:59.949 --> 00:11:02.360
And then I've got a couple of stories from
the trenches.

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:07.800
And then I promise you no differential equations
today.

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:08.050
Question.
Why should you have a Mission Control?

00:11:09.930 --> 00:11:12.920
Why is it necessary to have a Mission Control?

00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:16.920
I have four basic reasons to have a Mission
Control.

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:18.790
The first one is safety.

00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:24.829
We have seven or eight astronauts flying arguably
the most complex flight vehicle that has ever

00:11:24.829 --> 00:11:25.619
been invented.

00:11:25.619 --> 00:11:31.869
They don't have enough time or enough resources
to watch everything to the degree that is

00:11:31.869 --> 00:11:32.149
necessary.

00:11:32.149 --> 00:11:37.350
We have a large group of folks on the ground
in Mission Control, about 800 folks in Mission

00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:42.649
Control that are also monitoring at a very
detailed level with more information than

00:11:42.649 --> 00:11:48.040
the astronauts get to make sure that everything
is operating as it should be.

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:51.050
We provide a level of safety in Mission Control.

00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:53.240
Secondly, we provide flexibility.

00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:58.649
We start planning a Space Shuttle Mission
typically about 18 months in advance.

00:11:58.649 --> 00:12:05.649
The flight operations people are the flight
planning people, so the Space Shuttle program,

00:12:05.649 --> 00:12:10.879
NASA headquarters will come down and say you
need to fly a Space Shuttle flight that does

00:12:10.879 --> 00:12:17.879
X, services the Hubble Space Telescope, deploys
the Chandra X-Ray Telescope, goes to the International

00:12:20.410 --> 00:12:24.050
Space Station and adds a module or carries
supplies or what have you.

00:12:24.050 --> 00:12:30.249
Then it is up to the planners who will become
the operators to put that plan together.

00:12:30.249 --> 00:12:33.339
How are we going to accomplish the big objectives
on this flight?

00:12:33.339 --> 00:12:37.660
It's not just enough to take this big module
up and plug it into the Space Station.

00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:39.209
You've got to wire it up.

00:12:39.209 --> 00:12:43.860
You've got know when to do which wire first
and what switch to throw in what order or

00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:45.269
you will fry the circuits.

00:12:45.269 --> 00:12:46.999
It's a very complicated business.

00:12:46.999 --> 00:12:51.240
It is really complicated when you have to
deal with scientists.

00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:58.240
So, when we fly scientific payloads, we deal
with folks that are not operationally minded.

00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:04.759
They may have been working on their experiment
for, oh, how long did it take to get a doctorate

00:13:04.759 --> 00:13:07.660
degree, 15, 20 years in some cases.

00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:10.410
They have been working on this experiment
for many years.

00:13:10.410 --> 00:13:15.449
They are going to get the maximum amount of
data they can, but they are not aware of the

00:13:15.449 --> 00:13:20.720
fact that there are four other payloads onboard
and four other competing folks that want to

00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:22.449
get their science data in.

00:13:22.449 --> 00:13:28.019
We always have a discussion about how many
person hours of astronaut time can we devote

00:13:28.019 --> 00:13:28.749
to an experiment?

00:13:28.749 --> 00:13:32.920
How many kilowatt hours of power can we devote
to an experiment?

00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:34.749
On and on and on.

00:13:34.749 --> 00:13:39.629
And it makes these researchers do some really
tough sole-searching.

00:13:39.629 --> 00:13:44.559
And the saddest thing that I have ever seen
is an experiment, and there has been more

00:13:44.559 --> 00:13:51.119
than one of them, where they flipped the switch,
it blew the fuse, it was down for the count

00:13:51.119 --> 00:13:54.980
and lost all objectives with the first switch
throw.

00:13:54.980 --> 00:14:00.459
And then the scientists would come running
and in and say if you'll just let the astronauts

00:14:00.459 --> 00:14:04.839
take the back panel off and rewire this circuit
it will work.

00:14:04.839 --> 00:14:08.660
And we don't have time to do that on a spaceflight.

00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:12.699
Or, if we did have time to do it, we would
take that time away from experimenter number

00:14:12.699 --> 00:14:16.999
two or experimenter number three or all of
the above.

00:14:16.999 --> 00:14:22.920
In operations, there is a lot of work to set
priorities, set timelines, make sure you do

00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:27.300
things in the right order, and then train
the operators and the crew.

00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:33.749
Now, once you do that planning for 18 months
you understand the priorities, the pros and

00:14:33.749 --> 00:14:38.269
cons, the logic behind all of those trades.

00:14:38.269 --> 00:14:43.899
And so, when you go into flight and something
happens, as it always does, we can re-plan

00:14:43.899 --> 00:14:46.389
it on the fly.

00:14:46.389 --> 00:14:51.300
And we do, almost every flight or the vast
majority of flights, take the flight plan

00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:56.470
that we published pre-flight, put it gently
in the recycle bin and develop a new flight

00:14:56.470 --> 00:14:58.800
plan that can be drastically different.

00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:04.790
And we're able to achieve a great degree of
success in our operation of the objectives

00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:09.879
that we set out to do because we have the
people that can, in real-time while we're

00:15:09.879 --> 00:15:15.939
flying the flight, in this short period of
less than two weeks overnight re-plan and

00:15:15.939 --> 00:15:18.290
come back with a new plan to accomplish the
objectives.

00:15:18.290 --> 00:15:18.670
Yes sir.

00:15:18.670 --> 00:15:25.309
Wayne, I was one of those scientists who didn't
understand about the realities of spaceflight.

00:15:25.309 --> 00:15:32.309
And I liked your choice of the words "you
would discuss with us".

00:15:35.759 --> 00:15:37.790
Dictate would be the key word.

00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:38.040
Indeed.

00:15:37.839 --> 00:15:39.309
The question I wanted to address to you is
this business of taking the flight pad, putting

00:15:39.309 --> 00:15:42.279
it in the wastebasket and then generating
a new one.

00:15:42.279 --> 00:15:48.809
In the seven Shuttle flights that I would
have investigator status on, they all had,

00:15:48.809 --> 00:15:52.019
as their basic philosophy, a return to baseline.

00:15:52.019 --> 00:15:56.119
If something went wrong, get back to your
baseline plan as quickly as you could, even

00:15:56.119 --> 00:15:58.480
if you knew that it was non-optimal.

00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:00.579
Could you comment on that?

00:16:00.579 --> 00:16:03.149
I would say, from my perspective, quite the
opposite.

00:16:03.149 --> 00:16:04.730
Yes, there is a baseline plan.

00:16:04.730 --> 00:16:06.639
And there were very good reasons for that
baseline plan.

00:16:06.639 --> 00:16:09.850
But the flight control team is always looking
for the optimum solution.

00:16:09.850 --> 00:16:14.309
So I would say my perspective may be a little
bit different from yours, but that has been

00:16:14.309 --> 00:16:15.100
my experience.

00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:18.889
We are always trying to achieve the maximum
number of objectives.

00:16:18.889 --> 00:16:22.699
So flexibility from Mission Control is the
second big advantage.

00:16:22.699 --> 00:16:27.329
The third big advantage is let the crew focus
on those things that people can only do in

00:16:27.329 --> 00:16:27.579
space.
They have access to vacuum.

00:16:29.399 --> 00:16:30.749
They've got zero gravity.

00:16:30.749 --> 00:16:36.009
They've got the high vantage point to do earth
observations, what have you.

00:16:36.009 --> 00:16:37.670
You cannot do those things on earth.

00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:39.799
That is why we put people in space.

00:16:39.799 --> 00:16:46.799
And why would we make them calculate the gas
budget for deorbit burn which can be done

00:16:47.589 --> 00:16:54.399
by some bachelor of science engineer with
an accounting minor on the ground?

00:16:54.399 --> 00:16:59.029
So we let the crews focus on those things
that you can only do in space and we do every

00:16:59.029 --> 00:17:00.720
job that we can on the ground.

00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:04.980
Somebody calculated for me one time, and I
almost hate to give the statistic, that it

00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:07.900
is $30,000 a minute for people in space.

00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:13.030
You can hire a lot of engineers to offload
that amount of time.

00:17:13.030 --> 00:17:16.130
And, finally, there are some jobs that you
can only do on the ground.

00:17:16.130 --> 00:17:22.500
The NOAA weather satellites do not directly
uplink to the Shuttle so the astronauts don't

00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:26.869
know anything about weather, other than the
little part of the world they can see out

00:17:26.869 --> 00:17:27.690
their window.

00:17:27.690 --> 00:17:32.210
If you want to forecast where you land, that's
a job that you can only do on the ground.

00:17:32.210 --> 00:17:36.550
Obviously, radar tracking there are hundreds
of things that you can only do on the ground.

00:17:36.550 --> 00:17:41.180
And I would say interact with management and
review the priorities is one of those things

00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:42.910
that can only be done on the ground.

00:17:42.910 --> 00:17:49.110
Here is my first cartoon for the day that
compares airline travel to space travel.

00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:53.330
And I think this is a telling cartoon because
it is entirely true.

00:17:53.330 --> 00:18:00.330
I flew in last night on probably a 12 or 15
year old 737.

00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:03.520
It was a nice plane but a little shabby.

00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:07.820
And we got bumped around pretty good coming
into Boston.

00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:14.820
And I am thinking all the time about I wonder
if they have maintained this aircraft well.

00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:17.860
You can pick up the papers.

00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:22.680
And they do a very good job in the airlines,
but the fact of the matter is much of the

00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:27.060
airline industry is involved with passengers
and customer relations and baggage handling

00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:28.410
and all those good things.

00:18:28.410 --> 00:18:32.710
And the maintainers and the safety people
are few by comparison.

00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:39.460
In comparison with the Shuttle, we don't have
very many passengers to deal with.

00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:40.910
Generally, they are cooperative.

00:18:40.910 --> 00:18:43.430
Sometimes they get surly.

00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:45.510
But we don't have very many to deal with.

00:18:45.510 --> 00:18:49.390
And everybody in the program is a safety worker.

00:18:49.390 --> 00:18:54.140
And that is something we continuously exercise.

00:18:54.140 --> 00:19:01.140
To turn a Space Shuttle orbiter around from
one flight to the next takes 500,000 man hours

00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:03.480
of maintenance.

00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:06.450
There is a gem for you.

00:19:06.450 --> 00:19:13.450
People have been working for 30 years to decrease
the amount of time that it takes to turn the

00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:15.990
Space Shuttle orbiter around.

00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:22.990
It is a reusable vehicle, but it is a reusable
vehicle built with very small margins with

00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:27.020
a lot of complicated technology.

00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:28.780
And it takes a lot of maintenance.

00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:35.300
Some people think we would have been better
launching expendable rockets.

00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:40.360
The same amount of time, actually, a little
more is involved in launching Titan IVs which

00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:45.680
have the same payload throw weight as the
orbiter does to low earth orbit.

00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:52.680
The new launch vehicles Atlas V, Delta IV
and its variance are supposed to be launched

00:19:53.070 --> 00:19:54.900
with a whole lot less.

00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:58.410
However, they do not have the payload capacity
to orbit.

00:19:58.410 --> 00:20:05.380
And, in fact, they have not achieved their
goals of man hours to a launch that they have

00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:06.350
set out to yet.

00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:07.360
Although, they are early yet.

00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:09.430
We've got to give them time to work on it.

00:20:09.430 --> 00:20:14.660
But, the fact of the matter, getting into
space, whether you doing with an Ariane, a

00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:21.660
Soyuz, an H2 or an Atlas V, Delta IV or the
Space Shuttle remains a very expensive process

00:20:23.950 --> 00:20:27.800
which I think the public doesn't quite understand.

00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:31.060
I would like to talk about some of the things
that Mission Control does to get ready for

00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:33.870
a flight and then how they execute it in-flight.

00:20:33.870 --> 00:20:35.990
And first among those is trajectory control.

00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:41.930
Who in here is an orbital mechanics wizard?

00:20:41.930 --> 00:20:42.180
Good.

00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:42.480
OK.

00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:45.800
We will have some equations for you in just
a minute.

00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:48.430
Here is the first one.

00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:52.570
Would you like to step up and explain?

00:20:52.570 --> 00:20:55.040
OK.

00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:58.390
This is all involved in orbital mechanics.

00:20:58.390 --> 00:21:00.310
This is how do you get to orbit?

00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:04.240
We have the flight performance reserve of
main propulsion system propellant.

00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:08.430
We load a half a million gallons of propellant.

00:21:08.430 --> 00:21:15.430
That is over 2.5 million pounds of liquid
hydrogen and liquid oxygen in the external

00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:18.030
tank for the Shuttle.

00:21:18.030 --> 00:21:25.030
How much do we have for a normally planned
mission at the end of when you achieve orbital

00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:27.230
insertion?

00:21:27.230 --> 00:21:31.190
Anybody want to guess?

00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:37.280
Remember, every pound of propellant that you
leave in the tank and throw away into the

00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:41.850
ocean is a pound of payload that you could
have carried to orbit.

00:21:41.850 --> 00:21:45.110
So this is not a trivial process.

00:21:45.110 --> 00:21:47.080
Our goal is about 900 pounds.

00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:48.200
And you are going to see how we do.

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:52.910
But this is a little plot that we've developed
based on mixture ratio of the engines.

00:21:52.910 --> 00:21:59.910
Now, the Space Shuttle main engines have what
we call an overboard mixture ratio of 6.039

00:22:00.270 --> 00:22:00.990
nominally.

00:22:00.990 --> 00:22:06.110
We test fire them at the Stennis Space Center,
every engine for every flight, to check how

00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:12.200
they operate mixture ratio because mixture
ratio and ISP are critical.

00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:17.620
When we updated the Space Shuttle main engines
to the block two engines they are vastly safer

00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:22.170
than the original engines in the Shuttle because
they operate at lower pressures, lower temperatures

00:22:22.170 --> 00:22:27.350
and their rotating turbo machinery operates
considerably slower RPM.

00:22:27.350 --> 00:22:29.870
However, we gave us a second and a half of
ISP.

00:22:29.870 --> 00:22:36.020
And that is huge in this business, a second
and a half of ISP.

00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:40.250
This plot shows, as a function of mixture
ratio, if you have any shift in mixture ratio

00:22:40.250 --> 00:22:45.080
in flight, which we have, I'm going to talk
a little bit about that, you will change the

00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:46.660
amount of residual remaining.

00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:53.660
Here the
little blue dots are the normal flight performance
reserve.

00:22:57.500 --> 00:23:01.460
That is how much gas you've got left in the
tank when you get to orbit.

00:23:01.460 --> 00:23:07.490
And you can see our goal here is about 2500
pounds.

00:23:07.490 --> 00:23:14.490
Of that about 900 pounds is fuel residual
based on this curve right here.

00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:20.040
Now, you may ask why do you want to have an
extra amount of hydrogen fuel in the tank

00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:22.210
over oxygen, what is the difference?

00:23:22.210 --> 00:23:26.400
The engines are designed, the cutoff hydrogen
rich.

00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:31.010
We don't operate at the stoichiometric chemical
ratio that you would combine hydrogen and

00:23:31.010 --> 00:23:32.180
oxygen to make water.

00:23:32.180 --> 00:23:38.170
We operated at about a mixture ratio of six
instead of a mixture ratio that would be 18,

00:23:38.170 --> 00:23:38.570
I think.

00:23:38.570 --> 00:23:40.570
Did I do my chemistry right?

00:23:40.570 --> 00:23:42.590
It's been a while.

00:23:42.590 --> 00:23:44.850
We operate considerably off the stoichiometric
ratio.

00:23:44.850 --> 00:23:49.930
As you get mixture ratios that approach the
stoichiometric mixture ratio your fire burns

00:23:49.930 --> 00:23:52.100
a lot hotter.

00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:54.180
You get a lot more heat out of that fire.

00:23:54.180 --> 00:23:57.330
Metallurgically, the engines cannot stand
those higher temperatures.

00:23:57.330 --> 00:24:00.390
We already operate at 6000 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:24:00.390 --> 00:24:06.400
That is tough.

00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:11.940
You run out of fuel and cut off oxygen rich,
those temperatures will go out of site in

00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:13.720
the engine turbo pumps.

00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:16.590
So we want to cut off fuel rich.

00:24:16.590 --> 00:24:21.080
We biased ourselves so we cut off fuel rich,
but it does not take very much of a mixture

00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:24.490
ratio shift to get you to cut of LOX rich.

00:24:24.490 --> 00:24:31.490
In fact, as mixture ratio crosses the knee
of this curve, you wind up leaving actually

00:24:35.170 --> 00:24:38.870
a lot of LOX in the system cutting off on
the fuel side.

00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:42.640
So we have to carefully monitor how the engines
come in.

00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:47.610
And, when we talk about overboard mixture
ratio, that is not just what the engines operate

00:24:47.610 --> 00:24:50.180
at, but it's whatever losses you have in the
system.

00:24:50.180 --> 00:24:57.180
As you bleed hot hydrogen or hot oxygen off
the engines to repressurize the tank, that

00:24:57.730 --> 00:25:00.590
becomes a loss and that affects mixture ratio.

00:25:00.590 --> 00:25:05.450
One of the real problems we're dealing with
is, as we develop what we call engine tags

00:25:05.450 --> 00:25:10.660
down at the Stennis Space Center, we have
found an interesting phenomenon.

00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:17.550
In flight, we pressurize the tanks with their
native constituent, the oxygen tanks pressurized

00:25:17.550 --> 00:25:20.740
with oxygen and the hydrogen tanks pressurized
with hydrogen.

00:25:20.740 --> 00:25:27.320
At Stennis, where we do the engine tests and
develop the characteristics of each engine,

00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:31.600
and every engine is just a little bit different,
they pressurize their tanks with nitrogen

00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:33.870
for safety reasons.

00:25:33.870 --> 00:25:39.340
The nitrogen can diffuse into your hydrogen,
but more importantly it can diffuse into your

00:25:39.340 --> 00:25:40.410
oxygen system.

00:25:40.410 --> 00:25:47.410
And, therefore, you have a less pure propellant
and it drives our mixture ratio off as a function

00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:51.620
of having impurities in the propellant.

00:25:51.620 --> 00:25:56.650
So we get a tag of what we think the mixture
ratio is of the engine.

00:25:56.650 --> 00:25:59.850
That is different than what we get when we
go fly.

00:25:59.850 --> 00:26:04.950
And, in fact, the last flights, one of the
last meetings I had before I came down here

00:26:04.950 --> 00:26:11.950
yesterday was a meeting with our flight analyst
who have an unexplained missing 300 pounds

00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:19.000
of hydrogen every flight for the last 10 or
12 flights.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:23.740
And we are beginning to converge on the idea
that it is this nitrogen impurity in Stennis

00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:30.740
that gives us a false mixture ratio which
we design our flights around.

00:26:32.250 --> 00:26:34.380
Let's talk a little bit about it.

00:26:34.380 --> 00:26:36.130
Here is a little schematic.

00:26:36.130 --> 00:26:39.900
The external tanks really have two tanks,
the oxygen tank on top and the hydrogen tank

00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:41.590
on bottom.

00:26:41.590 --> 00:26:45.710
When we make it to orbit, how much is remaining
in each tank?

00:26:45.710 --> 00:26:48.880
Well, the answer to that question is none.

00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:51.930
What we are running on at orbit insertion
is what is left in the pipe.

00:26:51.930 --> 00:26:56.560
And it is really not orbit insertion but close
enough to talk about it.

00:26:56.560 --> 00:27:03.560
So we have 17 inch diameter pipe coming down
the side of the hydrogen tank from the oxygen

00:27:06.590 --> 00:27:07.630
tank up above.

00:27:07.630 --> 00:27:10.240
It goes across into the engine compartment
of the orbiter.

00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:15.560
And this shows you where several of the early
flights were at main engine cutoff, guided

00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:21.460
cutoff where we wanted to be from an orbital
mechanics standpoint, altitude velocity, flight

00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:22.600
path angle and so forth.

00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:23.600
That is where we were.

00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:26.230
That is how much was remaining in the tank.

00:27:26.230 --> 00:27:26.810
None in the tank.

00:27:26.810 --> 00:27:28.750
That is how much is remaining in the line.

00:27:28.750 --> 00:27:34.160
That is how close you have to cut it for spaceflight.

00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:38.360
I have another presentation, and if we have
time I might show you a few charts out of

00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:42.690
that, that talks about the difference between
commercial aviation and spaceflight.

00:27:42.690 --> 00:27:45.200
We operate on much smaller margins.

00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:51.050
And every pound you see in that far part of
the table that talks about the residual remaining,

00:27:51.050 --> 00:27:56.720
those number of pounds, and, by the way, we're
antiques.

00:27:56.720 --> 00:28:01.440
We use English tradition units in the Space
Shuttle program.

00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:05.880
But every pound residual that you have in
that far column is a pound that you could

00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:11.570
have taken to orbit of payload but did not.

00:28:11.570 --> 00:28:12.400
You threw that away.

00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:12.690
Yes.

00:28:12.690 --> 00:28:18.570
How do you measure that mass?

00:28:18.570 --> 00:28:19.520
Very good question.

00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:21.500
They look at pressure hit.

00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:27.810
We have pressure transducers down in the lines
as they approach the engine and you're accelerating

00:28:27.810 --> 00:28:29.170
at 3G.

00:28:29.170 --> 00:28:34.710
We have an inertial measurement unit that
measures velocity, and we control the engine

00:28:34.710 --> 00:28:38.400
throttle setting to 3Gs as we approach MECO.

00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:43.710
And so you look at the pressure and that determines,
based on a very simple head calculation, where

00:28:43.710 --> 00:28:47.100
you are in that standby coming down the outside.

00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:49.200
The fuel side is a little bit more complicated.

00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:54.770
They have a 5% level sensor in the tank that
tells you when you're at 5% in the tank.

00:28:54.770 --> 00:29:00.460
And then we have fuel flow meters on the hydrogen
side, and they calculate flow rate minus from

00:29:00.460 --> 00:29:03.520
the 5% level down to when a main engine is
cut off.

00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:05.880
So those are the ways we can do residual.

00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:07.760
And that is not a simple exercise.

00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:13.990
It is vastly more complicated than the simple
explanation I just gave you because the engines

00:29:13.990 --> 00:29:15.370
are throttling continuously.

00:29:15.370 --> 00:29:22.370
Now, I wanted to talk a little bit, if I can
move from normal mission planning to abort

00:29:22.940 --> 00:29:23.980
mission planning.

00:29:23.980 --> 00:29:28.810
Normal mission planning is something we do
upfront and then we monitor during flight.

00:29:28.810 --> 00:29:33.060
And one of the stories at the very end of
this presentation is about a day when things

00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:37.820
did not go right in the engine world and what
we did about it.

00:29:37.820 --> 00:29:39.960
This is going to talk about abort modes.

00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:42.180
Now, the Shuttle is very interesting.

00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:46.260
Human spaceflight is different than expendable
spaceflight because we would really like to

00:29:46.260 --> 00:29:46.880
get the people back.

00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:53.880
And expendable spaceflight, your basic principle
is if one of the rocket engines quits early

00:29:54.270 --> 00:29:57.210
you are done.

00:29:57.210 --> 00:29:58.870
The payload goes in the water.

00:29:58.870 --> 00:30:00.160
Or, if you launch from

00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:00.670
[NOISE OBSCURES]

00:30:00.670 --> 00:30:02.530
it may go into Mongolia.

00:30:02.530 --> 00:30:04.380
But you don't get it back.

00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:08.750
There are no overs with very few exceptions.

00:30:08.750 --> 00:30:13.950
If you have a problem in your main propulsion
system on an expendable rocket it is time

00:30:13.950 --> 00:30:16.090
to talk to your insurance company because
you are done.

00:30:16.090 --> 00:30:23.090
Even very minor problems can strand satellites
in lower orbits than they have useful life.

00:30:24.610 --> 00:30:29.280
It is very important that the propulsion system
work well.

00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:35.990
But the Shuttle was designed with the thought
that one of the three main engines could shut

00:30:35.990 --> 00:30:36.620
down early.

00:30:36.620 --> 00:30:42.050
We have safety monitoring on those engines
to make sure that they would shut down if

00:30:42.050 --> 00:30:48.550
something goes wrong in a contained, that
is to say they don't blow up, manner.

00:30:48.550 --> 00:30:52.860
And then you have to have the capability to
get the crew back, much like an airliner.

00:30:52.860 --> 00:30:59.100
If you fly on an airliner or any kind of multi-engine
aircraft, one of the things that they must

00:30:59.100 --> 00:31:02.310
be certified for is engine out operations.

00:31:02.310 --> 00:31:07.830
Lose an engine, pass the commitment point
on takeoff and still be able to takeoff safely

00:31:07.830 --> 00:31:09.260
and return to the airport.

00:31:09.260 --> 00:31:14.470
That is a fundamental principle in aviation
safety for a multi-engine aircraft.

00:31:14.470 --> 00:31:16.590
One of the Shuttle design goals is very similar.

00:31:16.590 --> 00:31:22.490
Lose one of the rocket engines, have it shut
down prematurely and still be able to land

00:31:22.490 --> 00:31:24.450
safely somewhere.

00:31:24.450 --> 00:31:25.720
Notice I said one engine.

00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:26.740
Not two engines.

00:31:26.740 --> 00:31:27.870
Not three engines.

00:31:27.870 --> 00:31:30.010
One engine.

00:31:30.010 --> 00:31:33.700
That is a huge technological leap over expendable
rockets.

00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:35.840
A huge technological leap.

00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:39.130
And we pay the price in terms of performance.

00:31:39.130 --> 00:31:41.210
Here is a little bit of the different abort
modes.

00:31:41.210 --> 00:31:46.020
If you have an engine out somewhere between
launch and about four minutes into flight,

00:31:46.020 --> 00:31:51.559
you have to return to the launch site which
involves turning around and flying backwards

00:31:51.559 --> 00:31:57.110
at mach 6 through your own rocket plume, which
is everybody's favorite thing to want to avoid

00:31:57.110 --> 00:31:57.790
doing.

00:31:57.790 --> 00:32:03.150
A little bit later than that we pick up the
capability to do transatlantic abort.

00:32:03.150 --> 00:32:07.430
Sometimes we call the transoceanic aborts,
but the acronym really is transatlantic abort,

00:32:07.430 --> 00:32:07.880
TAL.

00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:11.350
And land somewhere in Europe or Africa.

00:32:11.350 --> 00:32:15.470
And somewhat further along you can abort to
orbit.

00:32:15.470 --> 00:32:21.830
You can actually dump your secondary propellant
and wind up in a lower orbit.

00:32:21.830 --> 00:32:26.540
And then you may orbit once around or you
may come back on the third orbit.

00:32:26.540 --> 00:32:31.130
Or you may be able, in fact, to fly nearly
a normal mission depending on how lucky you

00:32:31.130 --> 00:32:36.280
got for the time that the engine was out and
how you were doing with reserves.

00:32:36.280 --> 00:32:39.550
Here is a little bit of different graphic,
a cartoon of the same thing.

00:32:39.550 --> 00:32:44.890
I don't like it too much because RTLS actually
turns the other way.

00:32:44.890 --> 00:32:49.480
But, as you can see, we would try to return
to the Kennedy Space Center which has possibly

00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:56.480
the worst weather in the entire western hemisphere
or continue on around or up on end to orbit.

00:32:56.880 --> 00:33:02.090
And you have to always be concerned about
external tank disposal.

00:33:02.090 --> 00:33:07.040
This was the abort regions chart generated
pre-flight for our last flight, STS-114.

00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:13.760
We have three TAL sites, transatlantic intact
TAL sites, one at the Zaragoza Air Base in

00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:20.760
North Spain, one at Moron Air Base in South
Spain near Seville and one at Le Tube which

00:33:21.090 --> 00:33:25.640
is the French Air Force Flight Test Facility
near Marseilles.

00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:28.600
And then we have what we call "Press to ATO".

00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:34.930
Press to abort which involves a dump, involves
changing your inclination of your orbit to

00:33:34.930 --> 00:33:37.170
a lower inclination if you invoke this.

00:33:37.170 --> 00:33:41.990
You cannot, for example, ever rendezvous with
the Space Station because you won't wind up

00:33:41.990 --> 00:33:45.570
in the right orbital inclination, even though
you may make the altitude.

00:33:45.570 --> 00:33:49.990
And then we have what we call "Press to MECO"
which involves just kind of closing your eyes

00:33:49.990 --> 00:33:56.559
and riding it out and see what happens as
you get close to your guided MECO.

00:33:56.559 --> 00:33:59.370
So we build these charts in advance.

00:33:59.370 --> 00:34:04.360
And then we have a very sophisticated computer
program in Mission Control that monitors the

00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:10.089
engines the entire time during launch called
the "abort region determinator" that can emulate

00:34:10.089 --> 00:34:14.739
a single engine out, two engines out, three
engines out or a vacuum impact point.

00:34:14.739 --> 00:34:18.399
And a flight dynamics officer is responsible
for making those calls.

00:34:18.399 --> 00:34:20.840
The crew does not make these calls.

00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:25.790
The crew has a crew card very similar to this
onboard so that if they lose communication

00:34:25.790 --> 00:34:31.030
with the ground and something bad happens
they might have a chance at pulling it off.

00:34:31.030 --> 00:34:35.429
But it is based on everything more or less
performing as planned.

00:34:35.429 --> 00:34:42.429
If anything is performing off normal than
these charts are no good.

00:34:42.918 --> 00:34:45.310
That is hosted in Mission Control.

00:34:45.310 --> 00:34:49.940
And until some day we put a supercomputer
onboard the space vehicle it will continue

00:34:49.940 --> 00:34:51.300
to be hosted in Mission Control.

00:34:51.300 --> 00:34:52.219
Do you have a question?

00:34:52.219 --> 00:34:52.469
Yes.

00:34:52.369 --> 00:34:58.460
That is a critical real-time call that is
made in a hurry.

00:34:58.460 --> 00:34:58.710
It is not always decision aid.
Can you comment a little bit on the reliance
upon the automatic decision aid computer that

00:35:03.630 --> 00:35:08.020
is grinding this out and the judgment of flight
control?

00:35:08.020 --> 00:35:12.310
Well, first of all, you have made a false
distinction because the people that wrote

00:35:12.310 --> 00:35:15.500
the computer code are the flight controllers.

00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:21.670
They understand the logic that went into it
with practice probably three days a week in

00:35:21.670 --> 00:35:27.950
Mission Control exercising simulated missions
that have engine problems so you practice

00:35:27.950 --> 00:35:28.890
that.

00:35:28.890 --> 00:35:30.010
It's not an either or.

00:35:30.010 --> 00:35:32.460
It's a symbiotic relationship.

00:35:32.460 --> 00:35:38.080
The abort region determinator doesn't work
without operators.

00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:42.380
Operators only have the cue cards to go on
if the abort region determinator software

00:35:42.380 --> 00:35:43.470
quits.

00:35:43.470 --> 00:35:45.550
You cannot get by without the other.

00:35:45.550 --> 00:35:47.050
There is some judgment involved.

00:35:47.050 --> 00:35:51.060
And a good flight dynamics officer with these
charts, with no

00:35:51.060 --> 00:35:51.680
[UNCLEAR]

00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:56.360
can make some judgment calls based on trends
and performance.

00:35:56.360 --> 00:35:58.190
But we need both.

00:35:58.190 --> 00:35:59.600
You cannot have one or the other.

00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:01.150
It is very sophisticated.

00:36:01.150 --> 00:36:02.770
It is very subtle.

00:36:02.770 --> 00:36:07.300
And very small changes can make this software,
this predictor work.

00:36:07.300 --> 00:36:14.300
It is probably the best example of an expert
system that I know of, but it takes a great

00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:16.290
deal of care and feeding.

00:36:16.290 --> 00:36:19.760
And it is very, very sensitive to the inputs.

00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:23.430
So it does take a lot of judgment and experience
to interpret.

00:36:23.430 --> 00:36:29.080
Along with that, we need to talk about where
you land.

00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:31.050
Because here are all the places.

00:36:31.050 --> 00:36:36.460
We kind of closed down Banjul and the Gambia
because we don't fly that inclination anymore.

00:36:36.460 --> 00:36:41.880
We do fly at the International Space Station
Missions, and we have the TAL sites I talked

00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:42.970
about.

00:36:42.970 --> 00:36:48.940
We could fly as high as 57 degrees inclination,
which we have done in the past, but that is

00:36:48.940 --> 00:36:52.190
outside the range of what we need to do for
the Space Station.

00:36:52.190 --> 00:36:56.630
The interesting thing is we get into the weather
story and the weather forecasting, and deciding

00:36:56.630 --> 00:37:01.790
which landing site you can go to is pretty
complicated.

00:37:01.790 --> 00:37:03.810
I never studied meteorology in college.

00:37:03.810 --> 00:37:04.590
It is another subject I wish I had.

00:37:04.590 --> 00:37:07.090
That is not all.

00:37:07.090 --> 00:37:10.640
We talked about intact abort landings if one
engine quits.

00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:14.740
But being good flight planners and controllers
you always take it to the next level.

00:37:14.740 --> 00:37:16.090
What if two engines quit?

00:37:16.090 --> 00:37:17.780
What if all three engines quit?

00:37:17.780 --> 00:37:22.300
And so we have made agreements all the way
up the East Coast of the United States with

00:37:22.300 --> 00:37:25.740
the Canadians to have places to land.

00:37:25.740 --> 00:37:29.670
And, again, we have agreements with all of
these landing sites.

00:37:29.670 --> 00:37:34.190
We send people to train them about what would
happen if the Shuttle would land there.

00:37:34.190 --> 00:37:35.390
We check the weather.

00:37:35.390 --> 00:37:40.030
Across the Atlantic we have landing sites.

00:37:40.030 --> 00:37:45.580
Again, Shannon, Ireland was probably the first
dry patch of land that you can come to on

00:37:45.580 --> 00:37:47.500
the far side of the Atlantic Ocean.

00:37:47.500 --> 00:37:54.110
Typical weather conditions there are 500 feet
overcast and rain and fog so we don't really

00:37:54.110 --> 00:37:55.369
probably want to use that.

00:37:55.369 --> 00:37:56.510
England is a little better.

00:37:56.510 --> 00:37:58.710
Cologne Bonn is a little better.

00:37:58.710 --> 00:38:02.050
And then we have all of these landing sites
that we can look at.

00:38:02.050 --> 00:38:06.790
And that keeps the State Department busy for
us because we have to have international agreements

00:38:06.790 --> 00:38:08.000
to use any of these places.

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:14.619
It took us two years to negotiate with the
French government for emergency use only of

00:38:14.619 --> 00:38:16.580
their landing site.

00:38:16.580 --> 00:38:22.210
We typically don't have people at these landing
sites other than our intact TAL sites, Moron,

00:38:22.210 --> 00:38:26.910
Zaragoza and Istres-Le Tube.

00:38:26.910 --> 00:38:28.050
But they are there.

00:38:28.050 --> 00:38:32.460
We would not hold the launch up if one of
the landing sites for two or three engines

00:38:32.460 --> 00:38:39.360
out was not available, but we would if we
did not have an intact landing site which

00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:40.440
is the one engine out requirement.

00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:42.200
So we have requirements difference.

00:38:42.200 --> 00:38:48.200
One of the really fun things is when we get
into the summer months we frequently cannot

00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:51.000
use some of these airports because they have
air shows going on.

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:58.000
And they would really like us to land the
Shuttle there during an air show, but we don't.

00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:02.100
One of the things that we have to watch very
carefully is where do we get rid of the external

00:39:02.100 --> 00:39:02.350
tank?
Now, we can carry the external tank to orbit.

00:39:05.020 --> 00:39:11.090
There have been some very colorful viewgraph
presentations put together of using the external

00:39:11.090 --> 00:39:13.720
tank as parts for a Space Station.

00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:17.590
Totally science fiction.

00:39:17.590 --> 00:39:20.119
Operationally it would be extremely difficult
to do.

00:39:20.119 --> 00:39:26.210
Carrying the tank to orbit would be very easy,
but we stopped just short of orbital velocity

00:39:26.210 --> 00:39:29.560
so that we can control the disposal of the
tank.

00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:33.690
We now have international treaties that say
you shouldn't put things in orbit without

00:39:33.690 --> 00:39:38.470
being able to put them in a place where they
don't hurt people.

00:39:38.470 --> 00:39:42.730
We don't like to have satellites reenter and
drop radioactive garbage or even just big

00:39:42.730 --> 00:39:48.830
hunks of metal on top of people, so we have
the external tank that we separate and drop

00:39:48.830 --> 00:39:53.200
just short of orbital velocity and use the
small orbital maneuvering engines on the Shuttle

00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:56.670
to provide the last couple hundred feet a
second to get to orbit.

00:39:56.670 --> 00:39:59.430
And we have to plan this very carefully.

00:39:59.430 --> 00:40:04.010
We've done a lot of studies to find out when
that tank will rupture, how big the pieces

00:40:04.010 --> 00:40:07.300
are, how far they've come apart.

00:40:07.300 --> 00:40:11.060
And we actually have flight rules talking
about ET disposal.

00:40:11.060 --> 00:40:12.790
This is a serious subject.

00:40:12.790 --> 00:40:19.790
Everybody that flies an expendable rocket
has to know where their stages are going to

00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:27.160
fall, except maybe the Russians who just drop
them in Kazak or used to.

00:40:27.750 --> 00:40:30.770
I grew up in New Mexico in the 1970s.

00:40:30.770 --> 00:40:35.510
We were very excited about the thought that
White Sands might be the launch site for the

00:40:35.510 --> 00:40:37.750
Shuttle when it was under early design phase.

00:40:37.750 --> 00:40:42.940
When they picked solid rocket boosters that
fell off just a couple hundred miles downrange,

00:40:42.940 --> 00:40:48.600
we knew that White Sands was out of the running
because that would put people at-risk in the

00:40:48.600 --> 00:40:49.950
continental United States.

00:40:49.950 --> 00:40:54.930
And those kinds of decisions make for launch
site decisions.

00:40:54.930 --> 00:40:58.930
Yes sir.

00:40:58.930 --> 00:41:02.940
[AUDIENCE QUESTION]

00:41:02.940 --> 00:41:04.550
We're talking a little less than an hour.

00:41:04.550 --> 00:41:11.550
Probably about 45 minutes from managing cutoff
to the rupture at about, let me see, let me

00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:17.570
make sure I say that right, 122 kilometers.

00:41:17.570 --> 00:41:18.640
I don't operate in kilometers.

00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:23.000
I have to do the math, but it's not long.

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:24.109
It's less than one orbit.

00:41:24.109 --> 00:41:25.730
One orbit taken 90 minutes.

00:41:25.730 --> 00:41:31.300
It's about halfway to two-thirds of the way
around the world that we get rid of the tank.

00:41:31.300 --> 00:41:33.910
And this is a very important subject.

00:41:33.910 --> 00:41:40.910
In fact, US laws and the Eastern Range that
we have to work with to get launch clearance

00:41:40.990 --> 00:41:46.570
issues what we call "Notice to Airmen" or
"ET disposal" about 48 hours prior to the

00:41:46.570 --> 00:41:50.640
Shuttle launch to clear the ocean area and
the air space.

00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:54.970
And this is all based on what we call a normal
main engine cutoff.

00:41:54.970 --> 00:42:00.230
We made our guided cutoff to orbit.

00:42:00.230 --> 00:42:05.920
And here is a little picture of a problem
we had earlier I want to talk about.

00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:08.770
Here are the ET disposal lines for the different
inclinations.

00:42:08.770 --> 00:42:15.050
You can see that some of these get kind of
close to the West Coast of Mexico, but most

00:42:15.050 --> 00:42:17.119
of them fall out in the Pacific Ocean.

00:42:17.119 --> 00:42:23.790
And, in particular, here are the Space Station
lines for disposal of the external tank.

00:42:23.790 --> 00:42:30.369
And, as we go through the five minute launch
window, the inclination of the orbit -- Not

00:42:30.369 --> 00:42:35.690
the inclination but the steering the Shuttle
has got to do to reach the Internal Space

00:42:35.690 --> 00:42:39.230
Station changes the place where these tanks
are disposed of.

00:42:39.230 --> 00:42:41.730
I think I have a better picture.

00:42:41.730 --> 00:42:48.730
And, in particular, we had a problem with
this little island right here that we were

00:42:51.609 --> 00:42:57.100
infringing on the internationally recognized
200 nautical mile limit for pieces.

00:42:57.100 --> 00:43:04.100
Now, if we do a normal insertion, you will
see that we have these typical nominal footprints

00:43:04.840 --> 00:43:06.740
based on where we were in the launch window.

00:43:06.740 --> 00:43:08.660
That is where all the pieces will fall.

00:43:08.660 --> 00:43:13.980
But we have dispersions based on trajectory
and other dispersions that say we've got to

00:43:13.980 --> 00:43:20.980
clear to a 99.7% probability this whole area,
or this is the area that results from all

00:43:21.540 --> 00:43:23.030
the dispersions at that level.

00:43:23.030 --> 00:43:25.250
So we don't want to drop pieces on people.

00:43:25.250 --> 00:43:31.280
Once upon a time, the United States Air Force
thought that Pitt Island down here was a bird

00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:34.060
sanctuary and nobody lived there.

00:43:34.060 --> 00:43:38.619
And they sent out the Notice to Airmen to
clear the area, and we found out there are

00:43:38.619 --> 00:43:42.250
a couple of hundred people that live on this
little island and the Australian government

00:43:42.250 --> 00:43:45.270
got kind of bent out of shape over that.

00:43:45.270 --> 00:43:50.430
We had to negotiate infringing by just a few
miles on the 200 nautical mile circle around

00:43:50.430 --> 00:43:55.109
these guys just at the toe of the footprint,
and that went back to the French government.

00:43:55.109 --> 00:43:57.730
And that took us two years to negotiate.

00:43:57.730 --> 00:44:01.970
So they don't teach you everything you need
to know in engineering school like negotiating

00:44:01.970 --> 00:44:08.970
with the French.

...disposal probability to your average diplomat,
like you say, we don't get training for that.

00:44:19.330 --> 00:44:20.109
Way beyond.

00:44:20.109 --> 00:44:26.400
Now, here is my funny story number one.

00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:31.760
Dick Richards, who was program manager before
me, was asked to go on speaking engagement

00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:33.130
to American Samoa.

00:44:33.130 --> 00:44:37.740
Now, I've been asked to speak a lot of places
and they are always like Boston or, you know,

00:44:37.740 --> 00:44:42.100
OK, this is a nice place to come, but think
about a speaking engagement in American Samoa.

00:44:42.100 --> 00:44:43.910
So he had to go to American Samoa to speak.

00:44:43.910 --> 00:44:50.210
And, as they got ready to leave, the airline
pilot came on and said we cannot take off

00:44:50.210 --> 00:44:53.190
because they are going to launch the Shuttle
today.

00:44:53.190 --> 00:44:54.859
He had seen these tanks come in.

00:44:54.859 --> 00:44:58.790
He was not about to violate that airspace
that they have been notified.

00:44:58.790 --> 00:45:02.880
And the launch time would put him past the
point of no return where they had to continue

00:45:02.880 --> 00:45:07.930
onto Hawaii and could not turn back to American
Samoa, so he wasn't going to take off until

00:45:07.930 --> 00:45:12.640
he got word that the Shuttle had either launched
or scrubbed for the day.

00:45:12.640 --> 00:45:13.500
And there was a delay.

00:45:13.500 --> 00:45:18.540
And so Dick Richards got on his cell phone
and called to Houston and found out that we

00:45:18.540 --> 00:45:24.290
were sitting on the ground in Florida based
on bad weather at the TAL site at Banjul and

00:45:24.290 --> 00:45:24.790
the Gambia.

00:45:24.790 --> 00:45:28.350
The passengers started talking about this.

00:45:28.350 --> 00:45:33.100
And they said you mean here we are in American
Samoa waiting on a Shuttle launch from Florida

00:45:33.100 --> 00:45:37.270
that has been delayed because of bad weather
in West Africa?

00:45:37.270 --> 00:45:40.010
The answer is yes.

00:45:40.010 --> 00:45:43.330
So, what you do has an impact all around the
world.

00:45:43.330 --> 00:45:44.859
OK, enough about trajectory.

00:45:44.859 --> 00:45:46.980
And I have quite a lot I could talk about.

00:45:46.980 --> 00:45:48.990
Let's talk about flight planning.

00:45:48.990 --> 00:45:53.890
One of the interesting things that we do onboard
the Space Shuttle is we carry a lot of laptop.

00:45:53.890 --> 00:45:57.750
At last count, I think we carried about 11
laptops on the last flight.

00:45:57.750 --> 00:46:01.490
But we don't rely on those laptops because
they keep breaking.

00:46:01.490 --> 00:46:05.450
What we rely on is paper.

00:46:05.450 --> 00:46:06.430
Spacelab flights are worse.

00:46:06.430 --> 00:46:13.430
I'd say the typical Space Shuttle flight that
launches carries 80 pounds of paper checklists.

00:46:14.320 --> 00:46:17.359
Every one of those pages lovingly crafted.

00:46:17.359 --> 00:46:22.300
We got maps and charts and we got all kinds
of little cue cards that stick up on Velcro

00:46:22.300 --> 00:46:26.369
all around the cockpit, but by and large they
come in books, and here are some of the books.

00:46:26.369 --> 00:46:31.510
And Mission Control folks build those books,
understand those books, can modify those books

00:46:31.510 --> 00:46:33.980
in real-time, and frequently do.

00:46:33.980 --> 00:46:38.800
One of the things we have to watch is printer
paper onboard because we cannot run out of

00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:40.830
printer paper when we update checklists.

00:46:40.830 --> 00:46:45.440
And so we have to monitor how much paper we
are using as we print out changes to the checklists

00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:45.960
onboard.

00:46:45.960 --> 00:46:47.790
Yes sir.

00:46:47.790 --> 00:46:51.170
[AUDIENCE QUESTION]

00:46:51.170 --> 00:46:54.570
In so far as paper can be made low flammable.

00:46:54.570 --> 00:46:58.859
It is but it is paper and it will burn.

00:46:58.859 --> 00:47:02.980
The Shuttle cockpit is full of flammable stuff.

00:47:02.980 --> 00:47:05.300
But it is tried to kept under control.

00:47:05.300 --> 00:47:06.300
It is tried to be protected.

00:47:06.300 --> 00:47:10.109
And, of course, we don't operate in a pure
oxygen atmosphere as Apollo did.

00:47:10.109 --> 00:47:14.350
It is very much like earth normal atmosphere.

00:47:14.350 --> 00:47:16.800
So, no, it is not fire proof.

00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:18.780
I wish it was.

00:47:18.780 --> 00:47:22.200
When we start a flight, we start out with
what we call a flight requirement.

00:47:22.200 --> 00:47:24.390
Here is the flight definition requirement
document.

00:47:24.390 --> 00:47:29.250
Here is the flight we just flew and the basic
parameters that we've got.

00:47:29.250 --> 00:47:30.849
Which orbiter are we going to fly?

00:47:30.849 --> 00:47:32.900
The next flight up we're going to fly Atlantis.

00:47:32.900 --> 00:47:34.770
Which external tank is TBD?

00:47:34.770 --> 00:47:36.619
Because we're still arguing about that.

00:47:36.619 --> 00:47:39.480
Which solid rocket booster pair, so on and
so forth?

00:47:39.480 --> 00:47:41.869
Which main engine by serial number?

00:47:41.869 --> 00:47:43.520
Which flight software release?

00:47:43.520 --> 00:47:47.760
How many cryogenic tanks do we have the arm
onboard and all this stuff?

00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:49.320
What is the manifest?

00:47:49.320 --> 00:47:56.320
Well, it is a station manifest for the utilization
flight 1.1 which has got an MPLM.

00:47:57.280 --> 00:48:03.080
It used to be called the Miniature Payload
Logistics Module.

00:48:03.080 --> 00:48:04.250
Now it is the Multi-Purpose.

00:48:04.250 --> 00:48:08.730
That transmigration of acronyms over time
have become more politically correct as a

00:48:08.730 --> 00:48:12.580
subject for a doctoral thesis, I think.

00:48:12.580 --> 00:48:14.990
Which launch pad we're going to operate out
of?

00:48:14.990 --> 00:48:17.040
And how many days are we going to fly?

00:48:17.040 --> 00:48:17.740
How many people?

00:48:17.740 --> 00:48:22.820
We're going to carry seven up, six down, land
at KSC and a bunch of remarks.

00:48:22.820 --> 00:48:24.520
This is kind of the basic definition.

00:48:24.520 --> 00:48:26.930
This is the starting point for a flight.

00:48:26.930 --> 00:48:29.900
This is what we get to start.

00:48:29.900 --> 00:48:31.680
And then we have to flush those out.

00:48:31.680 --> 00:48:36.700
We build a word document and we talk about
the requirements for a flight.

00:48:36.700 --> 00:48:38.359
This is done at the program level.

00:48:38.359 --> 00:48:39.930
What is the launch window?

00:48:39.930 --> 00:48:41.940
What is the launch period?

00:48:41.940 --> 00:48:48.090
And many of these things are just flushing
out the basic requirements you saw in the

00:48:48.090 --> 00:48:48.340
chart.

00:48:48.210 --> 00:48:53.970
Here is an interesting one, part of that flight
requirements document that talks about EVA

00:48:53.970 --> 00:48:58.080
spacewalks and talks about what we're going
to do.

00:48:58.080 --> 00:49:04.210
And you will notice, in great bureaucratic
language, the purposes of the EVAs are defined

00:49:04.210 --> 00:49:06.340
in another document that you have to go off
and look at.

00:49:06.340 --> 00:49:09.820
So, they're not any flight requirements documents
but at least you got a reference where to

00:49:09.820 --> 00:49:10.070
go.

00:49:09.950 --> 00:49:14.130
And here are some of the things we are going
to be able to do on this flight.

00:49:14.130 --> 00:49:19.500
And, in fact, we're going to have some contingency
or emergency EVAs that can do these emergency

00:49:19.500 --> 00:49:23.480
things, which we hope we don't have to do
but we are going to be prepared to do.

00:49:23.480 --> 00:49:26.810
From that we develop flight rules and flight
plans.

00:49:26.810 --> 00:49:31.330
Here is a page out of the flight rules book
that the ops people built.

00:49:31.330 --> 00:49:36.190
This is discussing how we take pictures of
the external tank.

00:49:36.190 --> 00:49:40.820
You saw those beautiful pictures just a few
minutes ago of the tank taken by the Shuttle.

00:49:40.820 --> 00:49:42.270
And here are the guidelines.

00:49:42.270 --> 00:49:49.270
We're going to have to do a thrust from the
plus X jets, but we won't do it if we've got

00:49:49.270 --> 00:49:54.150
problems in the propellant system, if we are
way under speed, if we're going to be dark

00:49:54.150 --> 00:49:59.650
because we don't have a flash that big, and
so on and so forth.

00:49:59.650 --> 00:50:02.890
And then that's the automated umbilical well
camera.

00:50:02.890 --> 00:50:05.280
And then we've got the handheld photography.

00:50:05.280 --> 00:50:07.780
And we've got a whole bunch of reasons why
we wouldn't do that.

00:50:07.780 --> 00:50:12.410
If we had to go to a backup software, we don't
want to do that because it makes it too sporty,

00:50:12.410 --> 00:50:14.510
just all kinds of reasons.

00:50:14.510 --> 00:50:17.119
Bob's people are thinking about this all the
time.

00:50:17.119 --> 00:50:19.349
And, in fact, it's not enough to have the
rule.

00:50:19.349 --> 00:50:21.540
Here is the rationale behind that rule.

00:50:21.540 --> 00:50:26.530
Why is it we decided you would or would not
take those pictures which are very important

00:50:26.530 --> 00:50:31.300
to us for post-flight analysis on a very detailed
level?

00:50:31.300 --> 00:50:36.859
Anything you see in italics font is what we
call flight rule rationale which is the subject

00:50:36.859 --> 00:50:43.190
of interminable meetings and lots of haranguing
and wrangling.

00:50:43.190 --> 00:50:45.430
Here is a little bit of the inspect rule.

00:50:45.430 --> 00:50:49.599
We all know that the thermal protection system
on the Shuttle is not as robust as we would

00:50:49.599 --> 00:50:50.020
like it to be.

00:50:50.020 --> 00:50:51.690
We are going to inspect it every time.

00:50:51.690 --> 00:50:57.380
Here are the priorities that are planned before
flight for thermal inspection system.

00:50:57.380 --> 00:51:00.190
And we start with the most important and we
work to the least important.

00:51:00.190 --> 00:51:05.150
Your goal is to do them all but your plan
is to have a plan ready if you run out of

00:51:05.150 --> 00:51:06.390
time.

00:51:06.390 --> 00:51:10.890
And then, again, the backup of why did we
say that.

00:51:10.890 --> 00:51:13.250
And, again, it is more inspection priorities.

00:51:13.250 --> 00:51:14.510
I am not going to go over all of these.

00:51:14.510 --> 00:51:15.510
You can look at them.

00:51:15.510 --> 00:51:17.700
I want to come back to EVAs for a minute.

00:51:17.700 --> 00:51:21.330
Here are some of the EVA task objectives.

00:51:21.330 --> 00:51:26.119
This is something that they did just the other
day onboard the International Space Station.

00:51:26.119 --> 00:51:30.359
This happens to be an International Space
Station rule, but it is closely related to

00:51:30.359 --> 00:51:31.090
the Shuttle rules.

00:51:31.090 --> 00:51:33.930
They put in a new camera group.

00:51:33.930 --> 00:51:38.560
All this is perfectly clear to you guys, all
these acronyms.

00:51:38.560 --> 00:51:42.750
It takes about six weeks to learn the language
when you come to work at NASA.

00:51:42.750 --> 00:51:48.310
And then we have something on the Station
called the floating point potential measurement

00:51:48.310 --> 00:51:54.180
device which is broken and became junk and
they threw it overboard just a couple of days

00:51:54.180 --> 00:51:54.430
ago.

00:51:54.250 --> 00:51:59.280
Well, you get through all the rules and you
come to a flight plan.

00:51:59.280 --> 00:52:00.420
And here is the flight plan.

00:52:00.420 --> 00:52:01.700
This is from the last flight.

00:52:01.700 --> 00:52:04.810
Eileen Collins, here is what she is doing
this particular day.

00:52:04.810 --> 00:52:08.320
This is flight day number three.

00:52:08.320 --> 00:52:11.480
This is what the pilot is doing.

00:52:11.480 --> 00:52:17.580
Some time I will have to tell you the difference
between pilot astronauts and mission specialists.

00:52:17.580 --> 00:52:18.070
Dr.

00:52:18.070 --> 00:52:19.359
Hoffman has his PhD.

00:52:19.359 --> 00:52:21.980
He well versed in many things.

00:52:21.980 --> 00:52:28.060
And the pilot, Jim Kelly, one of my favorite
guys, I like him a lot, flies jet planes so

00:52:28.060 --> 00:52:35.060
he gets post-sleep exercise.

00:52:36.040 --> 00:52:37.820
And so we have all the guys.

00:52:37.820 --> 00:52:41.200
And what they are doing by the hour of the
day, and this is the overview, by the way,

00:52:41.200 --> 00:52:43.990
but these guys are going out on a spacewalk.

00:52:43.990 --> 00:52:50.330
And so here is their EVA preparation, purging
their suits, getting setup, going out the

00:52:50.330 --> 00:52:50.900
door.

00:52:50.900 --> 00:52:54.540
Here is the EVA which are going to be outside
for 6.5 hours.

00:52:54.540 --> 00:53:00.270
And this particular day they're doing the
thermal protection system repair detailed

00:53:00.270 --> 00:53:04.200
test objective which you saw in the rules
as one of the priorities.

00:53:04.200 --> 00:53:06.080
So, we build this level of flight plan.

00:53:06.080 --> 00:53:08.290
Now, this is not it.

00:53:08.290 --> 00:53:14.660
We go to the minute-by-minute level, detailed
checklist, this is the overview.

00:53:14.660 --> 00:53:18.770
This is kind of OK, you've got to get up and
brush your teeth and make breakfast and then

00:53:18.770 --> 00:53:20.440
go do some work kind of thing.

00:53:20.440 --> 00:53:24.930
And then we have all of our other procedure
and checklist to make sure everything goes

00:53:24.930 --> 00:53:26.700
as perfectly as it possibly can.

00:53:26.700 --> 00:53:27.780
And this is just A day.

00:53:27.780 --> 00:53:30.730
And then we get all kinds of good little information
down here.

00:53:30.730 --> 00:53:34.140
One of which is when we're going to be able
to communicate with the astronauts.

00:53:34.140 --> 00:53:39.050
There was a revolution in flight control when
we launched the Tracking and Data Relay Satellites.

00:53:39.050 --> 00:53:44.440
Before we had Tracking and Data Relay Satellites
and you just had ground stations to communicate

00:53:44.440 --> 00:53:48.540
with the crew, we could talk to the crew about
15% of the time.

00:53:48.540 --> 00:53:51.540
85% of the time they were out of communications
with the earth.

00:53:51.540 --> 00:53:55.900
Now, if you were going to the Moon and you
used a Deep Space Network, you pretty much

00:53:55.900 --> 00:53:57.550
had continuous comm.

00:53:57.550 --> 00:54:01.220
But if you were doing Shuttle or any other
low-earth orbit kind of thing you could only

00:54:01.220 --> 00:54:04.550
talk to the crew for about 15% of the time.

00:54:04.550 --> 00:54:08.690
And sometimes it lined up that you would talk
to them three or four minutes every hour and

00:54:08.690 --> 00:54:10.140
a half.

00:54:10.140 --> 00:54:15.510
The Russians have a huge problem in that they
lost all of their tracking stations outside

00:54:15.510 --> 00:54:17.740
of geographical Russia.

00:54:17.740 --> 00:54:22.349
And so they talk to their crew and plan their
crew day on those parts of the orbit where

00:54:22.349 --> 00:54:23.810
they come over geographical Russia.

00:54:23.810 --> 00:54:25.510
And they are a slave to that.

00:54:25.510 --> 00:54:27.930
And we launched the Tracking and Data Relay
Satellite.

00:54:27.930 --> 00:54:30.410
Now we can talk to the crew all the time.

00:54:30.410 --> 00:54:33.609
There is virtually no time you cannot talk
to the crew.

00:54:33.609 --> 00:54:35.030
The crew gets really tired of that.

00:54:35.030 --> 00:54:39.630
They want to shut the radio off because Mission
Control is always calling up and yammering

00:54:39.630 --> 00:54:40.720
at them.

00:54:40.720 --> 00:54:45.530
But it is a revolution because now we can
get continuous data, communications and command

00:54:45.530 --> 00:54:47.060
with the crew from the ground.

00:54:47.060 --> 00:54:50.730
And the bottom line on that is we're much
more efficient.

00:54:50.730 --> 00:54:56.540
We don't have to wait for critical activities
to happen until we get that communication

00:54:56.540 --> 00:54:57.099
link.

00:54:57.099 --> 00:54:57.730
Yes sir.

00:54:57.730 --> 00:54:58.730
[AUDIENCE QUESTION]

00:54:58.730 --> 00:55:05.170
Mars there are going to be four to 20 minute
time delays in communications one way.

00:55:05.170 --> 00:55:06.210
Yes.

00:55:06.210 --> 00:55:11.099
What are the preliminary plans for dealing
with that?

00:55:11.099 --> 00:55:12.470
I don't know.

00:55:12.470 --> 00:55:13.700
No, I'm sorry.

00:55:13.700 --> 00:55:14.820
I'm serious.

00:55:14.820 --> 00:55:16.640
A lot of people are really worried about that.

00:55:16.640 --> 00:55:21.020
It will be a different way to operate.

00:55:21.020 --> 00:55:24.109
And the folks that are working on those programs
have got a real challenge.

00:55:24.109 --> 00:55:25.660
Two quick questions.

00:55:25.660 --> 00:55:31.150
One is if you time the checklist, I mean do
you know how long page three is going to take?

00:55:31.150 --> 00:55:31.849
Absolutely.

00:55:31.849 --> 00:55:36.540
And the other thing is do you have backup
flight plans for every contingency pretty

00:55:36.540 --> 00:55:41.030
much where you know if this experiment fails,
per se, we will pull out this flight plan

00:55:41.030 --> 00:55:42.740
and it reschedules everybody?

00:55:42.740 --> 00:55:43.470
No.

00:55:43.470 --> 00:55:46.339
In fact, what we do is we have some emergency
checklists.

00:55:46.339 --> 00:55:50.770
If you develop a leak in a cabin, OK, here
is the emergency drill checklist to get you

00:55:50.770 --> 00:55:53.040
back on the ground as soon as possible.

00:55:53.040 --> 00:55:58.480
But the flexibility that I talked about in
Mission Control is no, we don't build complete

00:55:58.480 --> 00:56:00.400
different timelines.

00:56:00.400 --> 00:56:03.460
Say if experiment A doesn't work we have a
different timeline.

00:56:03.460 --> 00:56:07.500
What we do is we have the smart people in
Mission Control that can take the existing

00:56:07.500 --> 00:56:09.900
timeline and build a new one.

00:56:09.900 --> 00:56:11.990
And, in fact, they do almost every night.

00:56:11.990 --> 00:56:12.780
I call it night.

00:56:12.780 --> 00:56:13.960
That is when the crew is asleep.

00:56:13.960 --> 00:56:19.290
It could be daytime in Houston but it is when
the crew is asleep.

00:56:19.290 --> 00:56:21.960
The last thing I want to talk about in a flight
preparation.

00:56:21.960 --> 00:56:22.210
Yes.
If the crew fall asleep at the same time,
isn't that not a bad idea in case something

00:56:28.190 --> 00:56:28.880
goes wrong?

00:56:28.880 --> 00:56:30.619
Shouldn't someone be keeping watch?

00:56:30.619 --> 00:56:33.609
Mission Control is watching, A, number one.

00:56:33.609 --> 00:56:36.490
And, B, number two, there are enough automatic
sensing.

00:56:36.490 --> 00:56:42.050
The computer is watching the really vital
things so that if you've got a link in the

00:56:42.050 --> 00:56:49.050
cabin, if you've got fire, something like
that happens, the alarms will go off and wake

00:56:49.150 --> 00:56:49.760
the crew off.

00:56:49.760 --> 00:56:54.320
One of the case studies I am going to show
is when Mission Control didn't get to watch,

00:56:54.320 --> 00:56:59.080
so look for that in a minute.

00:56:59.080 --> 00:57:00.190
The post-sleep period?

00:57:00.190 --> 00:57:02.500
Ask Jeff.

00:57:02.500 --> 00:57:09.500
The post-sleep period is what do you do after
your alarm clock goes off?

00:57:11.450 --> 00:57:18.450
There is cleanup, shave, get dressed and make
breakfast, which is a huge deal.

00:57:18.990 --> 00:57:24.050
This is not like taking something out of the
freezer, throw it in the microwave and eat

00:57:24.050 --> 00:57:24.560
it.

00:57:24.560 --> 00:57:28.740
It's a huge deal to cook and cleanup onboard.

00:57:28.740 --> 00:57:29.950
Personal hygiene time.

00:57:29.950 --> 00:57:33.330
It's also time that most crews spend reading
the morning mail.

00:57:33.330 --> 00:57:38.030
They don't get a newspaper but they get reams
and reams of paper off the printer from Mission

00:57:38.030 --> 00:57:38.400
Control.

00:57:38.400 --> 00:57:42.410
You thought you were going to do an EVA today,
but here is what we're really going to do.

00:57:42.410 --> 00:57:49.410
It's a really important time, getting ready
for the day, so we allow the crews about an

00:57:54.020 --> 00:57:57.380
hour and a half of post-sleep activities.

00:57:57.380 --> 00:58:00.849
And that is everything to get to work.

00:58:00.849 --> 00:58:01.099
Yes.
How do you decide what to tell the crew and
who makes that decision?

00:58:06.790 --> 00:58:09.470
Well, that's an interesting discussion.

00:58:09.470 --> 00:58:11.230
The flight director, of course, is in overall
charge.

00:58:11.230 --> 00:58:15.580
I should say that there are three shifts of
flight controllers in Mission Control, who

00:58:15.580 --> 00:58:18.190
are not ironmen, but that work about 9 hours.

00:58:18.190 --> 00:58:23.849
There is an hour handover period, and so three
shifts a day cover the day.

00:58:23.849 --> 00:58:26.280
A flight director is in charge of the team.

00:58:26.280 --> 00:58:31.609
The flight planners, big flight activities
officer we call them, obviously have a big

00:58:31.609 --> 00:58:32.500
part of this.

00:58:32.500 --> 00:58:39.500
On a day like this when it's an EVA day the
EVA officers have a big part of this.

00:58:40.130 --> 00:58:46.230
The CAPCOM, capsule communicator which is
held over from Mercury days, is an astronaut.

00:58:46.230 --> 00:58:48.080
And hopefully a flown astronaut.

00:58:48.080 --> 00:58:52.460
Not always but typically a flown astronaut
that is the crew's representative in Mission

00:58:52.460 --> 00:58:53.830
Control.

00:58:53.830 --> 00:58:57.940
And the CAPCOM is a very valuable resource
in saying here are things the crew would want

00:58:57.940 --> 00:59:01.530
to know, here are some things the crew already
knows so we don't have to tell them.

00:59:01.530 --> 00:59:06.650
Here you've built a plan that is going to
overwork the crew or here you've built a plan

00:59:06.650 --> 00:59:12.280
that has got people sitting around with a
lot of white space not doing anything getting

00:59:12.280 --> 00:59:14.950
bored.

00:59:14.950 --> 00:59:16.589
So, it becomes a team effort.

00:59:16.589 --> 00:59:22.990
Finally, the flight director approves all
uplink messages.

00:59:22.990 --> 00:59:23.240
Yes.
[AUDIENCE]

00:59:23.830 --> 00:59:30.830
...when do you tell the crew about that and
who decides?

00:59:32.980 --> 00:59:39.980
Well, again, it is a team so it's not this
military hierarchy that orders come from the

00:59:41.460 --> 00:59:41.710
top.

00:59:41.670 --> 00:59:42.570
There is a team.

00:59:42.570 --> 00:59:47.230
The team will develop here is what is happening,
here is what we think we're going to do.

00:59:47.230 --> 00:59:50.560
The stories come together enough and here
is the judgment factor.

00:59:50.560 --> 00:59:56.859
The flight director will tell the CAPCOM to
tell the crew in basic terms what the crew

00:59:56.859 --> 00:59:58.890
should know.

00:59:58.890 --> 01:00:01.619
Now, we have a lot of ways to communicate
with the crew.

01:00:01.619 --> 01:00:08.619
And the Shuttle we are very fixed, obsessed
with doing things on an open air to ground

01:00:10.580 --> 01:00:17.580
because in the old days they did some things
kind of pine that got came out in press conferences

01:00:18.060 --> 01:00:18.580
that were bad.

01:00:18.580 --> 01:00:25.580
The station crew has got this IP phone, Internet
Protocol phone and they can call you.

01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:28.330
Like right now if they had your phone number.

01:00:28.330 --> 01:00:32.460
They can just call you and talk on the phone,
and nobody knows what's going on.

01:00:32.460 --> 01:00:33.750
We have email with the crew.

01:00:33.750 --> 01:00:40.359
And a lot of things go up on email, but all
of those communication paths are utilized

01:00:40.359 --> 01:00:43.849
to get information back and forth to the crew.

01:00:43.849 --> 01:00:47.470
I probably ought to tell you one little short
story.

01:00:47.470 --> 01:00:51.849
This is my sports analogy story so you will
have to put up with that.

01:00:51.849 --> 01:00:55.460
Working in Mission Control is like working
in different sports.

01:00:55.460 --> 01:01:01.940
If you are the ascent entry shuttle team it
is like playing basketball full court press

01:01:01.940 --> 01:01:02.380
all the time.

01:01:02.380 --> 01:01:07.230
You are always running short time but very
intense.

01:01:07.230 --> 01:01:11.750
If you are a shuttle on orbit it is kind of
like American football.

01:01:11.750 --> 01:01:16.210
You huddle up, figure out what play you're
going to do, go out, execute the play, it

01:01:16.210 --> 01:01:18.410
worked or it didn't work, you come back, huddle
up.

01:01:18.410 --> 01:01:24.660
It is very episodic but it can happen fast
when it is happening, when you're executing

01:01:24.660 --> 01:01:25.089
it.

01:01:25.089 --> 01:01:28.020
The Space Station is baseball.

01:01:28.020 --> 01:01:33.109
It's a very much different game.

01:01:33.109 --> 01:01:38.930
And one of the hard things as you move as
a flight control from Shuttle ascent to Shuttle

01:01:38.930 --> 01:01:44.800
orbit to Space Station, you have to accommodate
the different rhythms of the game.

01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:49.070
The Russians have a phrase for when the Shuttle
comes to visit the Space Station.

01:01:49.070 --> 01:01:51.109
They say the hurricane came through.

01:01:51.109 --> 01:01:58.109
Because they have this nice orderly regime
and these folks come and fill the place up

01:01:59.650 --> 01:02:05.510
and they're doing stuff and they're throwing
things here and there and then they leave.

01:02:05.510 --> 01:02:12.390
And then we have to sort it all out and go
back to our normal kind of placid existence.

01:02:12.390 --> 01:02:16.490
The last thing about flight planning is we
talk about decision making.

01:02:16.490 --> 01:02:21.690
Here is the simplified diagram for the Chandra
X-Ray Telescope launch decision.

01:02:21.690 --> 01:02:28.690
AXAF, as you might know, is the Advanced X-Ray
Astrophysics Facility which got renamed Chandra

01:02:30.839 --> 01:02:31.089
Telescope.

01:02:30.900 --> 01:02:35.730
And we have the ascent flight direction, we
have a mission director, we have the ops director,

01:02:35.730 --> 01:02:38.480
we have the launch director, we've got the
KSC people and all these people.

01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:41.839
Then the prelaunch timeframe are all watching
their parts of this.

01:02:41.839 --> 01:02:42.859
They're watching the telescope.

01:02:42.859 --> 01:02:44.070
They're watching the upper stage.

01:02:44.070 --> 01:02:44.910
They're watching the Shuttle.

01:02:44.910 --> 01:02:46.490
They're watching a launch complex.

01:02:46.490 --> 01:02:49.300
Somebody has got to decide and they all have
got to talk to each other.

01:02:49.300 --> 01:02:52.420
And they are all, by the way, geographically
in different places.

01:02:52.420 --> 01:02:57.089
And you've got to know who is responsible
for what and who has authority to give information

01:02:57.089 --> 01:02:57.589
for what.

01:02:57.589 --> 01:03:03.349
Because you don't want somebody in the AXAF
control center saying to the NASA test director

01:03:03.349 --> 01:03:06.430
your shuttle doesn't look right on TV.

01:03:06.430 --> 01:03:12.690
He doesn't know that his TV is out of adjustment
or something.

01:03:12.690 --> 01:03:17.740
The plan to get all these people together,
what numbers they call, what they loops they

01:03:17.740 --> 01:03:19.680
talk on has got to all be worked through.

01:03:19.680 --> 01:03:24.480
That is a real operational nightmare when
you come to decision-making and communications.

01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:29.820
We have literally thousands of people involved
on a launch decision, a payload deploy decision

01:03:29.820 --> 01:03:31.770
and looking at their piece part.

01:03:31.770 --> 01:03:35.400
It has to be clearly defined what you're looking
at, what you're going to do if it doesn't

01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:41.000
look right, and so you have to spend a conservable
amount of time planning that, training for

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.099
it and then executing.

01:03:43.099 --> 01:03:50.099
And I think we ought to break here if we're
going to take a two-minute break.

01:03:57.020 --> 01:04:00.650
Thanks, Jeff.

01:04:00.650 --> 01:04:03.790
I hope this is helpful to you guys.

01:04:03.790 --> 01:04:06.420
It is not exactly the standard academic fare.

01:04:06.420 --> 01:04:09.170
I want to talk a little bit about systems
engineering because one of the things we pride

01:04:09.170 --> 01:04:13.349
ourselves on in an operations community is
that we are systems engineers.

01:04:13.349 --> 01:04:16.010
We're not mechanical, aero, what have you.

01:04:16.010 --> 01:04:20.400
You're a systems engineer and you've got to
know a little bit about a lot.

01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:22.779
One of my favorite authors is Robert Heinlein.

01:04:22.779 --> 01:04:25.089
You may have heard of him.

01:04:25.089 --> 01:04:31.150
And his quotation about what a human being
is I think is particularly appropriate to

01:04:31.150 --> 01:04:33.000
us.

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:40.000
And somehow this didn't come off on the page,
but the bottom line is he comes out with specialization

01:04:42.520 --> 01:04:47.220
is for insects.

01:04:47.220 --> 01:04:48.369
I'm not going to go over the Shuttle.

01:04:48.369 --> 01:04:51.500
You guys kind of know what it looks like and
why it got there.

01:04:51.500 --> 01:04:58.089
I was looking at the syllabus of the class
thinking I should have been in this class.

01:04:58.089 --> 01:04:59.920
Structurally, it is a complex vehicle.

01:04:59.920 --> 01:05:03.050
Inordinately complex in my way of thinking.

01:05:03.050 --> 01:05:09.359
But that is because of requiring wings for
the cross range, large aero surfaces for the

01:05:09.359 --> 01:05:15.520
aerodynamics and, of course, being able to
transform from a rocket to an on-orbit spacecraft

01:05:15.520 --> 01:05:19.250
to a hypersonic glider is not easy.

01:05:19.250 --> 01:05:24.329
The main landing gear and the tires is a subject
that I could talk about for a long time.

01:05:24.329 --> 01:05:27.190
And, in the interest of time, I took it out
of my presentation.

01:05:27.190 --> 01:05:31.630
But if I ever get a chance to come back -- I
think you probably had a discussion of that,

01:05:31.630 --> 01:05:34.140
but operationally they are a bear.

01:05:34.140 --> 01:05:38.380
Al Louviere actually gave a nice talk.

01:05:38.380 --> 01:05:38.630
Good.

01:05:38.599 --> 01:05:43.849
We are the only folks that operate tires in
that regime, other than the Concorde.

01:05:43.849 --> 01:05:46.029
And you guys know what happened to the Concorde.

01:05:46.029 --> 01:05:50.400
And we have real constraints on our tires
and fret about them all the time.

01:05:50.400 --> 01:05:57.170
Here is a list of the Space Shuttle systems
that we divide up into.

01:05:57.170 --> 01:05:59.079
One of my favorites is right here in the middle.

01:05:59.079 --> 01:06:02.040
Food.

01:06:02.040 --> 01:06:07.510
But it goes everywhere from the main propulsion
system onto the waste management system.

01:06:07.510 --> 01:06:08.800
Isn't that a great NASA acronym?

01:06:08.800 --> 01:06:13.430
This, I think, is an erroneously named chart
because it says Space Shuttle Systems.

01:06:13.430 --> 01:06:15.560
This ought to be Orbiter Systems.

01:06:15.560 --> 01:06:20.480
There are many other systems in the main engines
and so forth.

01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:23.990
One I would like to talk just a little bit
about is the environmental life control system.

01:06:23.990 --> 01:06:27.000
I think you probably had a little talk about
that before.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:30.849
Have you had an introduction to the environmental
system before?

01:06:30.849 --> 01:06:32.390
I think it is a wonderful system.

01:06:32.390 --> 01:06:33.900
Again, it is wonderfully complex.

01:06:33.900 --> 01:06:37.920
We have water in the crew compartment so that
if it leaks it is not hazardous.

01:06:37.920 --> 01:06:44.890
We have Freon out in a payload bay so it won't
freeze when it gets very cold.

01:06:44.890 --> 01:06:50.880
And we have this ammonia stuff for the last
part of entry which is a pain in the butt

01:06:50.880 --> 01:06:52.410
but it is what it takes to get there.

01:06:52.410 --> 01:06:59.410
As you know the story, basically we take oxygen
and hydrogen in the fuel cells and make electricity.

01:06:59.440 --> 01:07:01.839
And, as a happy byproduct, we make water.

01:07:01.839 --> 01:07:05.020
My case study here is going to be what do
we do with the water?

01:07:05.020 --> 01:07:10.730
These days, most of the time, we give the
water to the International Space Station where

01:07:10.730 --> 01:07:16.140
they can electrolyze it using electrical energy
from the solar rays and turn it back into

01:07:16.140 --> 01:07:21.540
oxygen, dump the hydrogen overboard and breath
the oxygen.

01:07:21.540 --> 01:07:26.950
We probably made this stuff by electrolyzing
seawater so it is going this back and forth,

01:07:26.950 --> 01:07:30.029
water to electricity to components.

01:07:30.029 --> 01:07:33.500
I wanted to talk a little bit about what we
do with this water.

01:07:33.500 --> 01:07:38.210
Some of the water is used as coolant through
the flash evaporator system.

01:07:38.210 --> 01:07:42.420
It is very important to us but we typically
run in excess, and so we've got to get rid

01:07:42.420 --> 01:07:46.240
of it which becomes a waste management problem.

01:07:46.240 --> 01:07:49.450
If the crew doesn't drink it, we have to dump
it overboard.

01:07:49.450 --> 01:07:51.460
As I say, we've tied into that system.

01:07:51.460 --> 01:07:56.930
And typically we've used the very pure water
and give it to the International Space Station

01:07:56.930 --> 01:07:57.920
these days.

01:07:57.920 --> 01:08:00.640
I am sorry the print is kind of small.

01:08:00.640 --> 01:08:03.109
But right here is the dump valve.

01:08:03.109 --> 01:08:08.210
And one of these is the waste and one of them
is the supply water dump valve where we dump

01:08:08.210 --> 01:08:08.910
that water out.

01:08:08.910 --> 01:08:12.109
Now, you'll notice something very interesting
about that dump valve.

01:08:12.109 --> 01:08:16.149
We have a window in a hatch and we've got
windows up here and we've got a TV camera

01:08:16.149 --> 01:08:23.149
here and a TV camera here and nobody can see
what is going on.

01:08:23.319 --> 01:08:25.960
Nobody can see what is going on coming out
of that dump valve.

01:08:25.960 --> 01:08:31.779
The only way to see is to take the arm out
and put it in a very sensitive position to

01:08:31.779 --> 01:08:35.330
look at what happened.

01:08:35.330 --> 01:08:37.420
In the old days they used to teach drafting.

01:08:37.420 --> 01:08:39.149
I always liked to look at these.

01:08:39.149 --> 01:08:41.859
The computer did not do this drawing.

01:08:41.859 --> 01:08:43.290
This is a work of art.

01:08:43.290 --> 01:08:44.899
This is the nozzle.

01:08:44.899 --> 01:08:48.690
The Shuttle was developed in the 1970s.

01:08:48.690 --> 01:08:51.979
We don't have a CAD model of the Shuttle.

01:08:51.979 --> 01:08:55.390
Jeff asked me could you send us the CAD model
of the Shuttle?

01:08:55.390 --> 01:08:59.630
We had a little arrow CAD model of the outer
mold line that the aero people use.

01:08:59.630 --> 01:09:01.559
There is no CAD model of the Shuttle.

01:09:01.559 --> 01:09:06.630
It exists on 800,000 paper drawings.

01:09:06.630 --> 01:09:12.960
And, when I came to work, one of the things
I got in the Program Office was a recommendation

01:09:12.960 --> 01:09:15.809
from the independent people to go off and
computerize all of this.

01:09:15.809 --> 01:09:19.140
And so we went off and tried to develop an
estimate to computerize it.

01:09:19.140 --> 01:09:25.899
They said it would take us eight years and
cost about $40 million to convert these drawings

01:09:25.899 --> 01:09:31.830
from paper to the latest -- What's the CAD
model that everybody uses?

01:09:31.830 --> 01:09:32.279
CATIA.

01:09:32.279 --> 01:09:33.649
I cannot remember.

01:09:33.649 --> 01:09:37.479
We are not going to do it because we don't
have the money, so we're still working with

01:09:37.479 --> 01:09:37.870
the paper products.

01:09:37.870 --> 01:09:38.839
Anyway, here is the nozzle.

01:09:38.839 --> 01:09:39.799
The water comes in.

01:09:39.799 --> 01:09:46.270
There is an orifice and a set of heaters because
you've got space on this side.

01:09:46.270 --> 01:09:48.750
And if you just push water out there it will
freeze.

01:09:48.750 --> 01:09:53.380
You want to keep it from freezing so you've
got the heaters in there.

01:09:53.380 --> 01:09:58.870
And this is a very tricky small orifice to
design, install and maintain.

01:09:58.870 --> 01:10:02.090
Now, here is what Mission Control sees.

01:10:02.090 --> 01:10:07.120
This is a plot of temperature, well, it's
actually three or four things versus time.

01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:11.050
And what we have here is the first thing that
happens is you turn on the heaters on the

01:10:11.050 --> 01:10:13.580
nozzle and the nozzle temperature warms up.

01:10:13.580 --> 01:10:18.550
Then you open the dump valve and the water
supply quantity goes down.

01:10:18.550 --> 01:10:24.790
And, as the water goes out, the nozzle temperatures
jitter a little bit, but they basically stay

01:10:24.790 --> 01:10:29.910
in this nice, warm 150 degree temperature
range.

01:10:29.910 --> 01:10:31.190
Close the dump valve.

01:10:31.190 --> 01:10:36.199
The water quits flowing, the nozzle bakes
out, turn the heaters off and it turns off.

01:10:36.199 --> 01:10:41.070
That is a normal water dump, what Mission
Control looks at all the time.

01:10:41.070 --> 01:10:43.570
The crew has got a timer.

01:10:43.570 --> 01:10:49.830
Or, better yet, Mission Control calls and
says start the dump now, stop the dump now.

01:10:49.830 --> 01:10:54.020
Sometimes they'll set a timer.

01:10:54.020 --> 01:10:58.400
Here is a little bit of an abnormal signature.

01:10:58.400 --> 01:11:03.660
Turn the heaters on, the temperature comes
up, it plateaued out and it kind of does this

01:11:03.660 --> 01:11:08.820
kind of thing, and people start scratching
their heads what is going on?

01:11:08.820 --> 01:11:13.150
There is another interesting thing.

01:11:13.150 --> 01:11:17.690
Here is one that warmed up, didn't get quite
as warm as it should have, sputtered out and

01:11:17.690 --> 01:11:18.820
quit.

01:11:18.820 --> 01:11:23.239
What is going on?

01:11:23.239 --> 01:11:27.860
We actually took the arm out and looked at
this nozzle, and there was an icicle that

01:11:27.860 --> 01:11:29.120
had grown on the outside.

01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:36.120
And, if you go back to this little drawing,
it turns out there is an offset here.

01:11:37.630 --> 01:11:40.510
And this nozzle has got a little offset to
it.

01:11:40.510 --> 01:11:47.510
And they had rotated the offset 180 degrees
so that the heat wasn't being applied properly

01:11:47.800 --> 01:11:49.020
and we were building an icicle.

01:11:49.020 --> 01:11:54.480
And we built probably a 16 foot long icicle
off the side of the Shuttle on more than one

01:11:54.480 --> 01:11:55.469
occasion.

01:11:55.469 --> 01:11:59.620
And actually went out on one flight with the
arm and knocked it off.

01:11:59.620 --> 01:12:04.130
Actually knocked it off like you would knock
an icicle off your eaves.

01:12:04.130 --> 01:12:11.130
The thing that clued us into this, in addition
to these temperature plots, was the fact that

01:12:15.190 --> 01:12:18.890
we came back with ice stuck to the top of
the payload bay doors.

01:12:18.890 --> 01:12:22.520
There was actually a lump of ice that survived
reentry.

01:12:22.520 --> 01:12:27.250
At the Kennedy Space Center there was a lump
of ice on top of the payload bay doors.

01:12:27.250 --> 01:12:33.580
How would you get a lump of ice on top of
the payload bay door?

01:12:33.580 --> 01:12:39.000
The reason is when this door is open, right
here, it hangs over.

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:45.040
And this icicle had grown all the way from
the gap from the nozzle to the open door and

01:12:45.040 --> 01:12:46.770
had actually stuck on the open door.

01:12:46.770 --> 01:12:52.980
And when we closed the door the icicle broke
off, people theorize, at the root and then

01:12:52.980 --> 01:12:57.920
carried this long stick of ice up and reentered
that way.

01:12:57.920 --> 01:13:04.920
And when we landed most of it was gone but
about a two or three pound ball of ice on

01:13:05.199 --> 01:13:07.150
the doors had survived reentry.

01:13:07.150 --> 01:13:09.400
Now, you might say, well, what is the big
deal about that?

01:13:09.400 --> 01:13:15.780
We also found a big hunk out of the insulating
tile on the OMS pod where some of that had

01:13:15.780 --> 01:13:20.090
broken off and had traveled back during entry
and struck the OMS pod.

01:13:20.090 --> 01:13:25.449
This is not a good thing because you are depending,
in early phases of atmospheric flight, on

01:13:25.449 --> 01:13:29.230
these thrusters for attitude control.

01:13:29.230 --> 01:13:34.150
And their propellant tank is right there inside
that pod.

01:13:34.150 --> 01:13:36.750
Not a good plan.

01:13:36.750 --> 01:13:41.309
There is an example of a mystery in Mission
Control that we had to work our way through

01:13:41.309 --> 01:13:44.070
over the course of, really, several flights.

01:13:44.070 --> 01:13:45.350
And they redesigned the nozzle.

01:13:45.350 --> 01:13:48.150
Here is the simplified drawing of the electrical
system.

01:13:48.150 --> 01:13:50.880
I think you guys have seen some of these systems
things before.

01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:56.530
We've got three fuel cells connected to three
main buses which branch out into all these

01:13:56.530 --> 01:13:58.480
sub-buses.

01:13:58.480 --> 01:14:02.460
If you are a flight controller you need to
understand how you get electrical power because

01:14:02.460 --> 01:14:04.600
everything on the Shuttle works on electricity.

01:14:04.600 --> 01:14:11.350
I am old enough now that I went to work in
Mission Control before the simulator had programmed

01:14:11.350 --> 01:14:13.320
in the electrical system.

01:14:13.320 --> 01:14:19.170
And I was a propulsion guy, OMS RCS guy, and
we practiced all this stuff about the propulsion

01:14:19.170 --> 01:14:20.940
system and what would you do if different
things happened.

01:14:20.940 --> 01:14:25.960
One day they released a new drop of the software
and all of a sudden the trainers could cause

01:14:25.960 --> 01:14:27.830
electrical power buses to fail.

01:14:27.830 --> 01:14:33.250
We didn't know what the heck was going on
but we learned in a big hurray because that

01:14:33.250 --> 01:14:36.590
is a big important part of our job.

01:14:36.590 --> 01:14:42.170
Here is a simplified picture of the communication
systems onboard the Shuttle.

01:14:42.170 --> 01:14:43.449
This is the simplified.

01:14:43.449 --> 01:14:44.960
Did you catch that?

01:14:44.960 --> 01:14:48.320
Have you guys been through the communication
system?

01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:55.320
We have S-band FM, S-band PM and Ku, and it
all comes in here and goes out there.

01:14:56.570 --> 01:15:02.750
And it is all cross-strap so that if any one
of these little black boxes doesn't work the

01:15:02.750 --> 01:15:06.360
integrated communications officer can send
commands and change it all around.

01:15:06.360 --> 01:15:09.670
Unless it was the communications boxes didn't
work, in which case we've got to call the

01:15:09.670 --> 01:15:13.420
crew on the other radio and tell them to go
throw some switches, which is very complicated.

01:15:13.420 --> 01:15:17.320
And if you don't talk to the crew from Mission
Control you don't do anything.

01:15:17.320 --> 01:15:23.340
If you don't get telemetry from the vehicle,
from Mission Control, you don't do anything.

01:15:23.340 --> 01:15:27.320
If you cannot command the vehicle, from Mission
Control, you don't do anything.

01:15:27.320 --> 01:15:30.820
You might as well go out and get a cup of
coffee because there is nothing you can do.

01:15:30.820 --> 01:15:36.800
If the comm systems folks are having a bad
day -- And I will just add that's one of the

01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:42.370
most serious malfunctions that we would practice
all the time so you had it cold.

01:15:42.370 --> 01:15:46.980
I mean if most things, if they break, you
can talk to the ground, get some help, they're

01:15:46.980 --> 01:15:53.250
looking over your shoulder, but if you cannot
communicate with the ground at that point

01:15:53.250 --> 01:16:00.250
onboard your success in getting home depends
on being able to analyze what is the malfunction

01:16:02.580 --> 01:16:03.460
and reestablish communication.

01:16:03.460 --> 01:16:05.670
So, we take that very seriously.

01:16:05.670 --> 01:16:08.380
And, I've got to tell you, this is a serious
design flaw in the Shuttle.

01:16:08.380 --> 01:16:11.550
And here is a principle you need to remember.

01:16:11.550 --> 01:16:13.300
When the systems were categorized

01:16:13.300 --> 01:16:14.400
[NOISE OBSCURES]

01:16:14.400 --> 01:16:18.550
they were categorized on the basis of the
severity of their failure mode.

01:16:18.550 --> 01:16:23.300
Obviously, the main propulsion system is what
we call a criticality one system.

01:16:23.300 --> 01:16:27.480
If bad things go wrong in the main propulsion
system really bad things could happen, so

01:16:27.480 --> 01:16:32.340
they spent serious design effort making sure
that nothing bad would happen.

01:16:32.340 --> 01:16:36.460
The communication system is a crit-3 system.

01:16:36.460 --> 01:16:40.880
That means that people did not spend the time
to make a robust communication system.

01:16:40.880 --> 01:16:43.820
It is not as reliable as some of the other
systems.

01:16:43.820 --> 01:16:45.730
And that was a huge mistake.

01:16:45.730 --> 01:16:47.930
And we have to fuss with this all the time.

01:16:47.930 --> 01:16:51.080
That is a huge headache.

01:16:51.080 --> 01:16:55.489
When you design something people say, well,
communications isn't critical.

01:16:55.489 --> 01:16:56.760
Absolutely wrong.

01:16:56.760 --> 01:16:59.130
Communications is absolutely vital.

01:16:59.130 --> 01:17:00.989
You cannot do anything without communication.

01:17:00.989 --> 01:17:05.150
A flight rule on the books says if we lose
all communication between a station and a

01:17:05.150 --> 01:17:09.530
shuttle the crew must land within 24 hours.

01:17:09.530 --> 01:17:15.199
And we keep updated with just enough information
so that they know where to land without communication.

01:17:15.199 --> 01:17:20.620
That is part of the news you get every morning
is an update of if you lose communication

01:17:20.620 --> 01:17:21.410
these are the landing sites.

01:17:21.410 --> 01:17:21.780
That's right.

01:17:21.780 --> 01:17:22.600
Here is where you want to go.

01:17:22.600 --> 01:17:24.770
Here is the weather and here are the times.

01:17:24.770 --> 01:17:29.460
This is the simplified drawing of the data
processing system.

01:17:29.460 --> 01:17:32.989
This is the hardware of the data process system.

01:17:32.989 --> 01:17:37.699
And you've got this general purpose computer
that goes out through all these data buses

01:17:37.699 --> 01:17:41.790
to all these multiplexers and demultiplexers
to talk to all these different pieces of gear.

01:17:41.790 --> 01:17:48.790
And we've got different buses to get into
each of the black boxes.

01:17:49.510 --> 01:17:54.699
And you can switch ports and it is very reconfigurable
and is a big pain in the butt.

01:17:54.699 --> 01:18:00.440
And if you want to operate as a systems flight
controller you have to understand it cold.

01:18:00.440 --> 01:18:05.070
This is the software, very simplified high
level view of the flight software onboard

01:18:05.070 --> 01:18:05.980
the computer.

01:18:05.980 --> 01:18:08.840
You guys talk about the onboard computers
on the Shuttle?

01:18:08.840 --> 01:18:09.980
OK.

01:18:09.980 --> 01:18:13.300
How much memory does a general purpose computer
have?

01:18:13.300 --> 01:18:20.300
512K memory.

01:18:23.480 --> 01:18:24.610
Not megs, not gigs, K.

01:18:24.610 --> 01:18:31.610
Of course, it works in ascent and vibrations
and radiation and all these other things.

01:18:33.190 --> 01:18:37.710
Very sophisticated software in a very small
place.

01:18:37.710 --> 01:18:40.440
What I grew up on is the reaction control
system.

01:18:40.440 --> 01:18:45.440
This has got helium pressurization going through
a series of regulators and valves down to

01:18:45.440 --> 01:18:48.860
propellant tanks which get manifolded out
to the various thrusters.

01:18:48.860 --> 01:18:50.440
You've got oxidizer and fuel.

01:18:50.440 --> 01:18:52.070
They come together and they make fire.

01:18:52.070 --> 01:18:58.440
And so I started life as a mechanical engineer
specializing in fluids so I'm supposed to

01:18:58.440 --> 01:19:01.650
understand things like pressure and temperature
and combustion.

01:19:01.650 --> 01:19:07.230
But I had to learn about valves which are
mechanical and electrically operated that

01:19:07.230 --> 01:19:12.880
are operated through the computer system so
all of those data buses on this page right

01:19:12.880 --> 01:19:13.960
here became very important to me.

01:19:13.960 --> 01:19:19.390
They are sometimes operated automatically
by the software so I have to understand all

01:19:19.390 --> 01:19:20.050
the software.

01:19:20.050 --> 01:19:23.690
And then we get to what we call we redundancy
management.

01:19:23.690 --> 01:19:27.920
We have this basic principle that we want
to have more than one of a critical thing.

01:19:27.920 --> 01:19:31.590
And so the question is how do you monitor
and manage that redundancy.

01:19:31.590 --> 01:19:38.590
And the reaction control system has got the
most sophisticated redundancy management program

01:19:38.820 --> 01:19:39.900
in the Shuttle.

01:19:39.900 --> 01:19:46.900
And it depends on instrumentation coming back
through those multiplexers and signal conditioners

01:19:48.130 --> 01:19:53.150
going to the computer that when it commands
through the digital autopilot those jets to

01:19:53.150 --> 01:19:54.870
fire they either do or they don't.

01:19:54.870 --> 01:19:56.250
And it tells it all about it.

01:19:56.250 --> 01:19:58.730
And then the crew gets notified back over
here.

01:19:58.730 --> 01:20:01.610
And it is very complicated, redundancy management.

01:20:01.610 --> 01:20:05.020
Redundancy is a way to provide reliability.

01:20:05.020 --> 01:20:07.300
Redundancy is not a means to an end.

01:20:07.300 --> 01:20:10.739
I noticed Chris Kraft said that the Shuttle
is quad redundant.

01:20:10.739 --> 01:20:12.340
That is not correct, Chris.

01:20:12.340 --> 01:20:13.860
The Shuttle is not quad redundant.

01:20:13.860 --> 01:20:14.880
We have four computers.

01:20:14.880 --> 01:20:16.730
They are not quad redundant.

01:20:16.730 --> 01:20:18.940
Now, if you go to a lot of systems, you only
have three of.

01:20:18.940 --> 01:20:24.360
If you go to some systems that you have four
of, one cannot do the job.

01:20:24.360 --> 01:20:25.570
For example, flight control.

01:20:25.570 --> 01:20:32.300
We have four flight control hydraulic channels
that operate the elevons.

01:20:32.300 --> 01:20:33.860
One channel cannot operate that.

01:20:33.860 --> 01:20:35.410
It takes two.

01:20:35.410 --> 01:20:37.150
So you've got four but it takes two.

01:20:37.150 --> 01:20:38.320
That means I can lose two.

01:20:38.320 --> 01:20:40.690
So, I am at best, three redundant.

01:20:40.690 --> 01:20:43.570
I can lose two and fly with two.

01:20:43.570 --> 01:20:47.780
The trouble is if you lose two and they get
in a fight with the other two it becomes very

01:20:47.780 --> 01:20:49.030
difficult to manage.

01:20:49.030 --> 01:20:51.550
One of my favorite systems is the inertial
measurement system.

01:20:51.550 --> 01:20:57.059
The main requirement on Shuttle avionics is
that it is fail operational/fail safe.

01:20:57.059 --> 01:21:00.940
You've got to be able to take the first failure
and you can keep flying the mission as planned.

01:21:00.940 --> 01:21:06.110
You take the second failure and you're still
safe to land because you've got one left.

01:21:06.110 --> 01:21:09.250
Three inertial measurement units, clearly
we are fail operational/fail safe.

01:21:09.250 --> 01:21:10.020
Well, no.

01:21:10.020 --> 01:21:16.550
If the first inertial measurement unit fails,
good to go, we keep on doing what we're doing.

01:21:16.550 --> 01:21:23.550
But those last two, if they disagree, how
do you know which one is telling you the truth?

01:21:24.460 --> 01:21:26.260
That is tough.

01:21:26.260 --> 01:21:33.260
We developed this mathematical scheme using
matrices and the navigation quaternion that

01:21:33.480 --> 01:21:34.940
would give us the best chance.

01:21:34.940 --> 01:21:40.510
We have about a 99.5% chance of determining
which IMU is telling us the truth versus lying

01:21:40.510 --> 01:21:43.410
to us, but it isn't foolproof.

01:21:43.410 --> 01:21:47.130
It takes people to manage it.

01:21:47.130 --> 01:21:52.130
We have opened ourselves, through redundancy,
to a system in some cases where we don't have

01:21:52.130 --> 01:21:53.130
quad redundancy.

01:21:53.130 --> 01:21:55.239
We have four ways to fail the system.

01:21:55.239 --> 01:22:02.239
The reaction control system is one of my favorites
because we have four jets on each side.

01:22:02.580 --> 01:22:05.219
For example, the yaw jets in the aft that
you need.

01:22:05.219 --> 01:22:06.860
So, you would say quad redundancy.

01:22:06.860 --> 01:22:09.449
No, I have four ways to fail.

01:22:09.449 --> 01:22:14.140
What I'd really like to have is just one jet
that would do the job and was highly reliable,

01:22:14.140 --> 01:22:20.020
but I've got four jets that are leaky that
get clogged up, that lie to you on the instrumentation

01:22:20.020 --> 01:22:24.059
that you've got to watch all the time because
I need at least two of them to do the job

01:22:24.059 --> 01:22:26.030
during entry.

01:22:26.030 --> 01:22:28.250
So, be careful when you say things about redundancy.

01:22:28.250 --> 01:22:31.440
What you're really after is reliability, not
redundancy.

01:22:31.440 --> 01:22:33.920
Redundancy is a way to reliability.

01:22:33.920 --> 01:22:40.449
And you build these incredibly complicated
schemes to deal with redundancy to provide

01:22:40.449 --> 01:22:44.270
the reliability of the system level you need.

01:22:44.270 --> 01:22:46.719
Simple is better, let me tell you.

01:22:46.719 --> 01:22:48.070
Complicated is not.

01:22:48.070 --> 01:22:54.010
I've got two stories from the trenches and
then I'm going to quit.

01:22:54.010 --> 01:22:58.100
You guys have not been asking too many questions
so that either means I am a brilliant lecturer

01:22:58.100 --> 01:23:01.410
or I'm putting you to sleep.

01:23:01.410 --> 01:23:02.980
This is not your standard academic fair.

01:23:02.980 --> 01:23:04.309
Is this good for you guys?

01:23:04.309 --> 01:23:04.760
OK.

01:23:04.760 --> 01:23:05.660
Yes sir.

01:23:05.660 --> 01:23:08.090
I have a question on the redundancy.

01:23:08.090 --> 01:23:14.420
Chris Kraft talked earlier this week about
how because you have four strings that you

01:23:14.420 --> 01:23:19.750
should launch if one string is broken and
not worry about it since you're still failsafe

01:23:19.750 --> 01:23:26.340
with what is left and that that would increase
the turnaround time and you would be able

01:23:26.340 --> 01:23:27.429
to launch more often.

01:23:27.429 --> 01:23:28.699
One IMU has failed, we'll launch with the
two because we know that 99.5% of the time

01:23:28.699 --> 01:23:31.219
that is good enough for us.

01:23:31.219 --> 01:23:32.070
Do you have any comments on that?

01:23:32.070 --> 01:23:36.730
Chris and I have had this discussion before.

01:23:36.730 --> 01:23:41.030
I have a technical response to this discussion.

01:23:41.030 --> 01:23:41.360
Bullshit.

01:23:41.360 --> 01:23:47.070
We are not reliable enough to launch with
anything down.

01:23:47.070 --> 01:23:53.380
This vehicle is barely reliable enough to
make the mission as planned when we launch

01:23:53.380 --> 01:23:55.309
full up.

01:23:55.309 --> 01:24:02.199
If you want to build a spacecraft that needs
two of or three of or four of.

01:24:02.199 --> 01:24:07.820
And you want to be able to launch with one
broken on the launch pad like sometimes your

01:24:07.820 --> 01:24:11.500
airplane takes off with something broken that
you, the passenger, don't know, but the pilot

01:24:11.500 --> 01:24:14.400
does and say it is OK.

01:24:14.400 --> 01:24:16.190
We're not at that stage.

01:24:16.190 --> 01:24:17.610
That is a nice idea.

01:24:17.610 --> 01:24:18.620
That is a great goal.

01:24:18.620 --> 01:24:22.160
I think people, when they thought about designing
the Shuttle, thought that we ought to do it

01:24:22.160 --> 01:24:22.929
that way.

01:24:22.929 --> 01:24:26.320
It doesn't work with the design we've got.

01:24:26.320 --> 01:24:29.179
If you were going to build a new Shuttle,
yeah, I would put five IMUs on it.

01:24:29.179 --> 01:24:35.800
Well, shoot, I would throw out the IMUs and
I would put GPS on it or something like that

01:24:35.800 --> 01:24:37.710
because it is more reliable.

01:24:37.710 --> 01:24:42.940
But we are not at a stage where we can launch
with less than the normal stuff.

01:24:42.940 --> 01:24:48.280
Our flight history is that we have terminated
three Shuttle flights because we lost redundant

01:24:48.280 --> 01:24:51.690
gear to the point where the flight rules said
you needed to come home.

01:24:51.690 --> 01:24:57.790
Now, if you had launched with just enough
gear so that the next failure puts you into

01:24:57.790 --> 01:25:01.850
shortened mission, you would have terminated
more flights early.

01:25:01.850 --> 01:25:05.780
The whole theory about the Shuttle, if you
go back to the very beginning, we are going

01:25:05.780 --> 01:25:07.250
to fly a flight a week.

01:25:07.250 --> 01:25:07.580
What?

01:25:07.580 --> 01:25:10.540
64 flights a year originally.

01:25:10.540 --> 01:25:12.330
That didn't happen for a variety of reasons.

01:25:12.330 --> 01:25:17.679
If you flew 64 flights a year, the theory
was if you got up there and something broke

01:25:17.679 --> 01:25:21.630
and you had to bring the payload back, OK,
we would just role it into the one next week

01:25:21.630 --> 01:25:23.580
and we would have enough flights.

01:25:23.580 --> 01:25:25.210
It hasn't happened that way.

01:25:25.210 --> 01:25:29.000
Spaceflight remains difficult because these
flights are rare.

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:35.270
The best we've ever done, I think, is ten
flights in a year in 1985.

01:25:35.270 --> 01:25:38.170
And typically we're talking four or five flights
in a year.

01:25:38.170 --> 01:25:39.050
These flights are rare.

01:25:39.050 --> 01:25:45.670
The pressure is on to get the maximum advantage
out of every flight.

01:25:45.670 --> 01:25:49.800
And I think spaceflights are going to remain
rare with the technology we've got into the

01:25:49.800 --> 01:25:50.230
future.

01:25:50.230 --> 01:25:55.150
That is probably a discussion for a future
date, but the fact of the matter is that Shuttle

01:25:55.150 --> 01:26:02.030
does not have the reliability in its piece
parts to launch with one of things down.

01:26:02.030 --> 01:26:07.190
JEFF: Wayne, let me ask you a question to
speak to, you know, just here at a classroom,

01:26:07.190 --> 01:26:10.719
not as the Shuttle manager and not for attribution.

01:26:10.719 --> 01:26:13.480
This is a danger, when people

01:26:13.480 --> 01:26:14.400
[OVERLAPPING VOICES]

01:26:14.400 --> 01:26:14.650
.
Sheila Widnall was here and told us about
CARB and their reputation.

01:26:19.590 --> 01:26:26.590
What is your feeling about the wisdom of ending
the Shuttle flights at the end of the decade?

01:26:27.140 --> 01:26:28.750
WAYNE: I have a couple of thoughts.

01:26:28.750 --> 01:26:30.630
First of all, I am a Shuttle hugger.

01:26:30.630 --> 01:26:31.590
I grew up with Shuttle.

01:26:31.590 --> 01:26:33.000
Shuttle is an amazing vehicle.

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.030
It is a huge technological leap.

01:26:35.030 --> 01:26:37.030
I am very proud of what it has done.

01:26:37.030 --> 01:26:40.179
On the other hand, we need a replacement.

01:26:40.179 --> 01:26:43.120
It has got some serious shortcomings.

01:26:43.120 --> 01:26:48.660
And if you look at the history of aviation
and the first 30 years from the Wright Brothers

01:26:48.660 --> 01:26:55.610
to, say, the DC3, that was about 35 years,
a little less.

01:26:55.610 --> 01:27:00.250
DC3 was the first economically practical airliner,
right?

01:27:00.250 --> 01:27:02.739
Everybody wanted to compare the Shuttle to
the DC3.

01:27:02.739 --> 01:27:09.739
The problem is between the Wright Flyer in
1903 and a DC3 in 1935 or thereabouts, they

01:27:11.340 --> 01:27:15.100
went through probably 10,000 designs.

01:27:15.100 --> 01:27:16.580
They had trial and error.

01:27:16.580 --> 01:27:17.730
We tried things out.

01:27:17.730 --> 01:27:20.000
We found out what worked, we found out what
didn't.

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:21.620
They junked the bad designs.

01:27:21.620 --> 01:27:25.280
They took the good designs, and they took
the good parts of the good designs and built

01:27:25.280 --> 01:27:26.800
the next designs even better.

01:27:26.800 --> 01:27:32.620
They probably went through 10,000 variations
on aircraft to get to that point.

01:27:32.620 --> 01:27:35.410
Now, we've been flying in space for about
35 years.

01:27:35.410 --> 01:27:37.500
Count them all.

01:27:37.500 --> 01:27:40.070
Chinese, Russian, American.

01:27:40.070 --> 01:27:44.260
How many space vehicles have there been?

01:27:44.260 --> 01:27:45.550
Human space vehicles.

01:27:45.550 --> 01:27:46.429
Less than ten.

01:27:46.429 --> 01:27:53.429
Soyuz, Vostok, Voskhod, Mercury, Gemini, Apollo,
Skylab, Shuttle, Shenzhou, what am I missing?

01:27:57.730 --> 01:27:59.679
That's about it.

01:27:59.679 --> 01:28:02.929
How can you possibly advance that technology?

01:28:02.929 --> 01:28:07.179
It is ludicrous to think that you are going
to advance the technology without doing the

01:28:07.179 --> 01:28:10.070
iteration that we saw in early aviation.

01:28:10.070 --> 01:28:15.739
We should have replaced the Shuttle 20 years
ago as a nation with a more advanced version

01:28:15.739 --> 01:28:20.469
that fixed some of the shortcomings that made
it more economical to operate.

01:28:20.469 --> 01:28:25.000
We should have done a lot of things but, for
national reasons, we didn't.

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:26.640
So, I am torn.

01:28:26.640 --> 01:28:27.730
I love the Shuttle.

01:28:27.730 --> 01:28:29.570
It is a great machine.

01:28:29.570 --> 01:28:31.130
I spent my whole career with it.

01:28:31.130 --> 01:28:36.040
It gives us capabilities that we are going
to give up, frankly, when we go to the CEV.

01:28:36.040 --> 01:28:38.550
It's going to be a different kind of machine
that does different kinds of things.

01:28:38.550 --> 01:28:42.790
And we are going to miss the Shuttle, I am
convinced.

01:28:42.790 --> 01:28:46.610
But should we long ago have built a new one?

01:28:46.610 --> 01:28:47.809
Absolutely.

01:28:47.809 --> 01:28:49.550
Are we behind where we should be?

01:28:49.550 --> 01:28:50.969
Absolutely.

01:28:50.969 --> 01:28:55.949
We need to invent the next generation of spacecraft
and be ready to go on and invent the next

01:28:55.949 --> 01:28:56.559
one after that.

01:28:56.559 --> 01:29:00.300
The Shuttle was designed for a ten year life.

01:29:00.300 --> 01:29:06.770
We should have been working on Shuttle II
the day that Columbia launched the first flight.

01:29:06.770 --> 01:29:07.469
OK.

01:29:07.469 --> 01:29:09.710
That is my perspective.

01:29:09.710 --> 01:29:11.040
Anybody else?

01:29:11.040 --> 01:29:11.290
Yes.

01:29:11.210 --> 01:29:18.210
This might be outside of the realm of the
discussion, but those 10,000 different designs

01:29:18.840 --> 01:29:22.660
that were done for aircraft were done largely
by private sector, right?

01:29:22.660 --> 01:29:25.070
There was a fair amount of government.

01:29:25.070 --> 01:29:26.370
And, remember, it wasn't all American.

01:29:26.370 --> 01:29:30.780
There was a large amount of government subsidy.

01:29:30.780 --> 01:29:34.679
And it was, frankly, a cheaper technology
to develop.

01:29:34.679 --> 01:29:36.390
Rocket technology is difficult to develop.

01:29:36.390 --> 01:29:39.020
I will go back to Heinlein my favorite author.

01:29:39.020 --> 01:29:42.460
He says when you're in earth orbit you are
halfway to anywhere in the universe.

01:29:42.460 --> 01:29:47.580
Getting the first hundred miles off the planet
is very hard, but once you get in earth orbit

01:29:47.580 --> 01:29:51.380
or thereabouts you are halfway to anywhere
in the universe.

01:29:51.380 --> 01:29:54.050
And we still have not cracked that nut.

01:29:54.050 --> 01:29:56.250
I really like the space elevator guys.

01:29:56.250 --> 01:30:00.210
It is science fiction but the idea is a good
one.

01:30:00.210 --> 01:30:04.870
There ought to be a different technology other
than rockets to get to space.

01:30:04.870 --> 01:30:08.130
Somebody did a calculation that said if we
had an elevator to the Moon, we could get

01:30:08.130 --> 01:30:10.370
to the Moon for about $10 worth of electricity.

01:30:10.370 --> 01:30:15.360
Of course, there is a big "if" that goes in
front of that rolling that elevator.

01:30:15.360 --> 01:30:18.870
So, rockets are an exceedingly difficult technology.

01:30:18.870 --> 01:30:21.830
I want one of you guys to invent a new technology.

01:30:21.830 --> 01:30:27.480
Aaron Cohen, he may have already told you
this, tells one of the great stories of all

01:30:27.480 --> 01:30:28.929
times about spaceflight.

01:30:28.929 --> 01:30:33.949
He talks about when he was in the management
of the Space Shuttle program and the fact

01:30:33.949 --> 01:30:38.199
that the main engines were causing just awful
problems getting them developed.

01:30:38.199 --> 01:30:39.610
Stop me if you heard the story.

01:30:39.610 --> 01:30:45.980
And one day he woke up and said wouldn't it
be great if somebody just invented an antigravity

01:30:45.980 --> 01:30:49.000
device and we could get away from rockets?

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:52.239
Wouldn't that just be great?

01:30:52.239 --> 01:30:56.600
And he thought about it a little while longer
and said no, it would still have braised welds

01:30:56.600 --> 01:31:00.920
and electronic parts and all the things that
are causing us problems on the engines would

01:31:00.920 --> 01:31:04.440
cause us problems with the antigravity machine.

01:31:04.440 --> 01:31:07.469
Get him to tell you the story.

01:31:07.469 --> 01:31:09.630
He tells it better than I do.

01:31:09.630 --> 01:31:12.239
But we need a better technology, quite frankly.

01:31:12.239 --> 01:31:16.330
We need something that makes the transition
from propellers to jet engines.

01:31:16.330 --> 01:31:19.059
We need something like that.

01:31:19.059 --> 01:31:24.900
The Space Shuttle main engines in terms of
the rocket cycle thermodynamically are about

01:31:24.900 --> 01:31:31.600
99% of the maximum theoretical efficiency
for a hydrogen/oxygen rocket engine.

01:31:31.600 --> 01:31:34.280
You're not going to do any better.

01:31:34.280 --> 01:31:36.800
We need a new technology.

01:31:36.800 --> 01:31:40.420
You might make them cheaper, you might make
them more reliable but you're not going to

01:31:40.420 --> 01:31:44.429
lift any more pounds to orbit.

01:31:44.429 --> 01:31:45.719
So, we need that revolution.

01:31:45.719 --> 01:31:46.309
OK.

01:31:46.309 --> 01:31:48.150
Well, I'm passionate about it.

01:31:48.150 --> 01:31:49.040
Anybody else?

01:31:49.040 --> 01:31:49.290
Yes.

01:31:49.170 --> 01:31:50.850
[AUDIENCE QUESTION]

01:31:50.850 --> 01:31:55.920
You're talking to the wrong guy.

01:31:55.920 --> 01:31:57.580
Of course it's a help.

01:31:57.580 --> 01:32:03.719
If you want to talk about whether it's a hindrance,
ask him after I'm gone.

01:32:03.719 --> 01:32:07.500
Some of our astronauts friends which we'd
shut up.

01:32:07.500 --> 01:32:12.210
But, no, seriously, I think everybody would
say that Mission Control is actually a vital

01:32:12.210 --> 01:32:14.219
part of the process.

01:32:14.219 --> 01:32:16.410
You've got to plan the missions.

01:32:16.410 --> 01:32:17.800
You've got to execute the missions.

01:32:17.800 --> 01:32:20.030
There are only so many people onboard the
vehicle.

01:32:20.030 --> 01:32:21.410
These are not autonomous vehicles.

01:32:21.410 --> 01:32:26.110
That is another word that really sets my teeth
on edge when people say space vehicles ought

01:32:26.110 --> 01:32:30.199
to be autonomous like commercial aircraft.

01:32:30.199 --> 01:32:30.929
It just sets my teeth on edge.

01:32:30.929 --> 01:32:34.489
Have you ever seen what it takes to plan a
commercial aircraft flight?

01:32:34.489 --> 01:32:38.469
There are more people on the ground than there
are in the cockpit by a lot.

01:32:38.469 --> 01:32:42.699
And I'm not talking about the baggage handlers
and I'm not even really talking about the

01:32:42.699 --> 01:32:44.370
mechanics that keep it flying.

01:32:44.370 --> 01:32:49.199
Everybody has got to plan the routes, got
to make sure that they've got the manifesting

01:32:49.199 --> 01:32:53.739
right, make sure that they've got the fuel
right, all that planning process, you've got

01:32:53.739 --> 01:32:54.570
to have people that do that.

01:32:54.570 --> 01:32:58.780
Saying you're going to get by without that
shows a total ignorance of how the world really

01:32:58.780 --> 01:33:03.230
works.

01:33:03.230 --> 01:33:05.840
Now I'm beginning to sound like Chris Kraft.

01:33:05.840 --> 01:33:09.780
I want to share with you a couple of stories.

01:33:09.780 --> 01:33:13.640
This is something you ought to past on your
wall.

01:33:13.640 --> 01:33:15.449
The last law of robotics.

01:33:15.449 --> 01:33:19.559
The only real errors are human errors.

01:33:19.559 --> 01:33:23.170
Mother nature does not make mistakes.

01:33:23.170 --> 01:33:29.760
If you flew your airplane into a thunderstorm
and it crashes, was it mother nature's fault?

01:33:29.760 --> 01:33:34.239
No, you were stupid and flew your airplane
into a place that it wasn't designed to handle.

01:33:34.239 --> 01:33:39.160
Perhaps the weather forecaster gave you a
bad forecast.

01:33:39.160 --> 01:33:45.910
Perhaps your weather radar was insufficient
and didn't pick up that nimbus cumulous cloud

01:33:45.910 --> 01:33:49.390
on its radar, but it wasn't mother nature's
fault.

01:33:49.390 --> 01:33:50.760
It was a human error.

01:33:50.760 --> 01:33:55.610
They used to talk about in aircraft accidents
there were really three causes for aircraft

01:33:55.610 --> 01:33:56.040
accidents.

01:33:56.040 --> 01:33:58.600
There is pilot error, which we all understand.

01:33:58.600 --> 01:34:02.890
The pilot turned left when he should have
gone right, you know, something much more

01:34:02.890 --> 01:34:04.630
sophisticated than that.

01:34:04.630 --> 01:34:04.980
Pilot error.

01:34:04.980 --> 01:34:06.660
There is mechanical failure.

01:34:06.660 --> 01:34:08.780
Mechanical failure can come for two reasons.

01:34:08.780 --> 01:34:11.940
Number one, the aircraft was not maintained
properly.

01:34:11.940 --> 01:34:18.940
I remember that Alaska airline jet that went
down because it had the mechanism in the tail

01:34:19.010 --> 01:34:23.520
that had the long spiral grooved shaft and
they didn't lubricate it properly and it wore

01:34:23.520 --> 01:34:23.850
off.

01:34:23.850 --> 01:34:27.080
And finally they had no elevator control and
the plane crashed.

01:34:27.080 --> 01:34:30.150
It wasn't maintained properly or it wasn't
designed properly.

01:34:30.150 --> 01:34:34.270
It wasn't design properly to handle the environment
that it flew in.

01:34:34.270 --> 01:34:36.270
So, mechanically.

01:34:36.270 --> 01:34:37.030
Or weather.

01:34:37.030 --> 01:34:40.150
Well, I submit that weather is not a cause
of an accident.

01:34:40.150 --> 01:34:44.160
Weather is a human failure because you need
to understand what you're capable of operating

01:34:44.160 --> 01:34:47.870
your vehicle in, and you don't operate it
in environments that you're not capable of

01:34:47.870 --> 01:34:48.370
handling.

01:34:48.370 --> 01:34:50.460
The only real errors are human errors.

01:34:50.460 --> 01:34:55.400
It's either the pilot, the engineer that designed
it, the guys that didn't maintain it properly

01:34:55.400 --> 01:34:58.159
or maybe the guys that didn't forecast the
weather right.

01:34:58.159 --> 01:34:59.090
Those are human errors.

01:34:59.090 --> 01:35:01.659
They are not acts of god.

01:35:01.659 --> 01:35:06.010
You need to understand the environment you're
going to operate your spacecraft in.

01:35:06.010 --> 01:35:09.059
Make sure you design it robustly so it doesn't
come apart.

01:35:09.059 --> 01:35:13.949
Makes sure you design it so that it can be
maintained and you make sure the instructions

01:35:13.949 --> 01:35:17.360
for the maintainers is done properly.

01:35:17.360 --> 01:35:22.889
And, finally, you've got to train your crews
so they can pilot it properly.

01:35:22.889 --> 01:35:23.429
OK.

01:35:23.429 --> 01:35:27.000
One of the things that the Shuttle doesn't
do well is navigate on its own.

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:28.940
The Shuttle has an inertial navigation system.

01:35:28.940 --> 01:35:30.510
We're trying to upgrade it to GPS.

01:35:30.510 --> 01:35:33.590
We've been trying to upgrade it to GPS for
ten years.

01:35:33.590 --> 01:35:40.210
Maybe we will get the next vehicle Endeavor
out of its maintenance depot period with GPS

01:35:40.210 --> 01:35:43.980
and fly it with GPS, but right now we fly
it with inertial measurement systems.

01:35:43.980 --> 01:35:50.980
Those inertial measurement systems, developed
right here at the Charles Stark Draper Lab,

01:35:51.870 --> 01:35:53.929
have some drift in them.

01:35:53.929 --> 01:35:58.210
After about a day their knowledge of where
the Shuttle is creeps off.

01:35:58.210 --> 01:36:05.210
It creeps off enough so that you could not
reenter safely because the error in the onboard

01:36:07.449 --> 01:36:11.409
knowledge of where the Shuttle is is different
from where the Shuttle actually is.

01:36:11.409 --> 01:36:18.409
In addition to that, the integration over
time doesn't give you a good state vector

01:36:19.139 --> 01:36:25.489
so we track the Shuttle from the ground with
radar and update what we call the state vector

01:36:25.489 --> 01:36:29.199
position, velocity and direction, six components
at least once a day.

01:36:29.199 --> 01:36:32.860
On STS-32, Mission Control screwed it up.

01:36:32.860 --> 01:36:37.679
There is a long flight.

01:36:37.679 --> 01:36:44.679
The ninth day of the flight the INCO officer
sent a bad command that caused the Shuttle

01:36:49.030 --> 01:36:51.210
orbiter to lose attitude control.

01:36:51.210 --> 01:36:54.480
And if the propulsion system had been configured
differently they would have run the little

01:36:54.480 --> 01:36:54.860
jets.

01:36:54.860 --> 01:36:59.870
If they had been on the big jets we might
have used up enough gas so that the crew could

01:36:59.870 --> 01:37:01.949
not have reentered safety.

01:37:01.949 --> 01:37:03.540
This is a serious error.

01:37:03.540 --> 01:37:07.510
It also happened at about 3:00 in the morning.

01:37:07.510 --> 01:37:12.710
I would offer to you that you ought not do
critical things in the wee hours of the morning.

01:37:12.710 --> 01:37:19.710
Writing term papers, running somewhat hazardous
experiments are not things you want to do

01:37:21.389 --> 01:37:23.380
at 3:00 in the morning.

01:37:23.380 --> 01:37:28.870
That error was recognized and corrective actions
were taken immediately.

01:37:28.870 --> 01:37:33.760
But, due to some other circumstances, it was
a near thing.

01:37:33.760 --> 01:37:36.570
We were out of control and out of communications
for about ten minutes.

01:37:36.570 --> 01:37:39.389
And this was in the middle of crew sleep.

01:37:39.389 --> 01:37:45.699
What they did basically was to uplink a state
vector that told the computer that the position

01:37:45.699 --> 01:37:48.860
of the orbiter was somewhere outside the Milky
Way Galaxy.

01:37:48.860 --> 01:37:53.260
I mean it was that kind of thing.

01:37:53.260 --> 01:37:55.580
OK.

01:37:55.580 --> 01:37:57.210
Here is the story for the night.

01:37:57.210 --> 01:38:04.210
This is 17 days, 23 hours to 18 days GMT.

01:38:04.620 --> 01:38:07.199
This was in the early part of the year.

01:38:07.199 --> 01:38:09.980
This is a one hour time period.

01:38:09.980 --> 01:38:14.780
The crew is awakened in the middle of crew
sleep because an onboard smoke alarm goes

01:38:14.780 --> 01:38:15.670
off.

01:38:15.670 --> 01:38:16.889
There was no fire.

01:38:16.889 --> 01:38:20.110
It was just an erroneous alarm, but it woke
the crew up.

01:38:20.110 --> 01:38:24.909
Now, when you are the flight control team
and you are working when the crew is asleep,

01:38:24.909 --> 01:38:28.290
your number one goal is to keep the crew asleep.

01:38:28.290 --> 01:38:29.489
Don't let them wake up.

01:38:29.489 --> 01:38:31.960
So, this flight control team has already failed.

01:38:31.960 --> 01:38:38.909
They allowed an erroneous alarm to wake the
crew.

01:38:38.909 --> 01:38:45.639
A little bit later the flight dynamics officer
says we need to reinitialize the state vector,

01:38:45.639 --> 01:38:48.370
which is something that we normally do, about
once a day.

01:38:48.370 --> 01:38:51.989
It is interesting that this is in the middle
of crew sleep.

01:38:51.989 --> 01:38:56.870
Normally it is done when the crew is awake,
but the flight dynamics officer says we need

01:38:56.870 --> 01:39:01.440
to uplink a new position and velocity sort
of vectors.

01:39:01.440 --> 01:39:04.070
The flight director says did you do a good
job, Fido?

01:39:04.070 --> 01:39:05.389
Fido says of course we did.

01:39:05.389 --> 01:39:09.739
Flight say OK, you have a go to uplink that
vector.

01:39:09.739 --> 01:39:13.510
The integrated communication officer gets
the word from the flight dynamics officer,

01:39:13.510 --> 01:39:18.969
I want you to go to the computer and get vector
number umpty-ump and uplink it to the crew.

01:39:18.969 --> 01:39:24.199
And the integrated communications officer
uplinks the vector to the onboard system.

01:39:24.199 --> 01:39:28.199
Now, there is a check in the onboard system
that goes into a buffer in the computer.

01:39:28.199 --> 01:39:33.159
And that buffer gets sent telemetry back to
the ground, and the ground computer compares

01:39:33.159 --> 01:39:38.889
what is in the onboard versus what is sent
and they should be the same.

01:39:38.889 --> 01:39:44.600
We send about 5000 commands in the course
of a two week flight, and normally they always

01:39:44.600 --> 01:39:45.489
compare.

01:39:45.489 --> 01:39:52.130
This particular time there was a problem,
some radio noise or something and the data

01:39:52.130 --> 01:39:53.260
got scrambled.

01:39:53.260 --> 01:39:58.469
And it came back to the ground and the computer
put out the little words "data reject".

01:39:58.469 --> 01:40:05.469
In other words, the command that you sent
is not what is onboard, the integrated communications

01:40:06.610 --> 01:40:10.380
officer.

01:40:10.380 --> 01:40:13.460
The backroom is doing other things.

01:40:13.460 --> 01:40:20.460
The guy in the front room, integrated communications
officer checks the display and says, for whatever

01:40:20.699 --> 01:40:25.750
reasons at 3:00 in the morning, OK, punches
the button to send the execute.

01:40:25.750 --> 01:40:30.940
In other words, move the data from the buffer
into the navigation software.

01:40:30.940 --> 01:40:31.570
It is wrong.

01:40:31.570 --> 01:40:34.570
But he just makes a human error and sends
it.

01:40:34.570 --> 01:40:39.800
His backroom guy, because we always work in
teams, is doing something else and didn't

01:40:39.800 --> 01:40:42.400
check his work.

01:40:42.400 --> 01:40:43.780
Normally there is a check and balance.

01:40:43.780 --> 01:40:49.850
Before you send buffer execute you say to
somebody else does this look OK to you, too?

01:40:49.850 --> 01:40:51.300
They missed that check.

01:40:51.300 --> 01:40:52.280
What happens?

01:40:52.280 --> 01:40:54.050
They send this command.

01:40:54.050 --> 01:40:57.989
The Shuttle thinks it is in orbit around,
I was going to say Alpha Centauri, but it

01:40:57.989 --> 01:41:04.989
was a lot farther away than that doing what
we call local vertical/local horizontal hold.

01:41:06.770 --> 01:41:12.920
Well, now it's doing LV/LH around the star
in the Andromeda Galaxy, I guess, and it goes

01:41:12.920 --> 01:41:13.550
out of control.

01:41:13.550 --> 01:41:14.559
Not fast.

01:41:14.559 --> 01:41:16.239
Now, this doesn't tumble end over end.

01:41:16.239 --> 01:41:22.730
It reaches three degrees a minute rate, which
is not a high rate but you're moving out of

01:41:22.730 --> 01:41:23.429
your attitude.

01:41:23.429 --> 01:41:24.530
Well, what happens?

01:41:24.530 --> 01:41:28.420
When you move out of your attitude the antennas
are no longer pointing at each other.

01:41:28.420 --> 01:41:32.449
The Shuttle antenna is no longer pointing
at the tracking and data relay satellite so

01:41:32.449 --> 01:41:37.620
command, data, voice, go away.

01:41:37.620 --> 01:41:38.300
Loss of signal.

01:41:38.300 --> 01:41:44.739
The worst thing the flight director can hear
is loss of signal with the crew.

01:41:44.739 --> 01:41:46.070
OK.

01:41:46.070 --> 01:41:53.070
We got lucky because about ten minutes later
it just happened to be acquired back through

01:41:53.230 --> 01:41:53.889
the satellite.

01:41:53.889 --> 01:41:55.300
It just happened to be acquired back.

01:41:55.300 --> 01:41:57.650
We got lucky and they called the crew.

01:41:57.650 --> 01:42:04.650
The crew switched to a manual autopilot, turns
on the big jets, restores the attitude and

01:42:07.870 --> 01:42:08.699
life goes back to normal.

01:42:08.699 --> 01:42:11.639
The crew now has been awakened twice, by the
way.

01:42:11.639 --> 01:42:13.300
They are going to be grumpy the whole next
day.

01:42:13.300 --> 01:42:19.820
If the big jets, which use a lot of gas, had
been on in that ten minutes, we could have

01:42:19.820 --> 01:42:24.800
used the entire entry allowance of propellant.

01:42:24.800 --> 01:42:27.070
OK.

01:42:27.070 --> 01:42:28.889
As anything there is always a chain of events.

01:42:28.889 --> 01:42:33.750
The flight dynamics officer was unable to
do this navigation state vector prior to crew

01:42:33.750 --> 01:42:36.909
sleep because of the vehicle activity.

01:42:36.909 --> 01:42:40.489
In other words, they had been doing maneuvers
and they had to get the radars to track to

01:42:40.489 --> 01:42:42.989
build a solution.

01:42:42.989 --> 01:42:46.510
Plans were made to uplink the state vector
during sleep, which is not terribly unusual

01:42:46.510 --> 01:42:48.659
but not the typical situation.

01:42:48.659 --> 01:42:52.909
During a sleep period, and I don't know why
they put during a sleep period, we typically

01:42:52.909 --> 01:42:59.100
can have telemetry dropouts and radio frequency
interference and conditions which cause telemetry

01:42:59.100 --> 01:43:00.230
dropouts.

01:43:00.230 --> 01:43:03.159
They were predicted because of the orbiter
attitude.

01:43:03.159 --> 01:43:06.989
The antennas don't always point in the best
part of the antenna pattern.

01:43:06.989 --> 01:43:08.469
That we're going to have that.

01:43:08.469 --> 01:43:11.370
We had the onboard smoke alarm that woke the
crew up.

01:43:11.370 --> 01:43:13.219
We let them go back to sleep.

01:43:13.219 --> 01:43:17.590
This is the same thing I went through.

01:43:17.590 --> 01:43:24.120
Twelve seconds after he sent the back command
the backroom guy this did trivial recorder

01:43:24.120 --> 01:43:31.120
command and we saw that they were miscompared.

01:43:31.760 --> 01:43:33.139
And this is really the key.

01:43:33.139 --> 01:43:37.940
Seventeen seconds after calling up the display
the backroom attempted to question the decision

01:43:37.940 --> 01:43:44.080
but too late, the button had been pushed by
seventeen seconds.

01:43:44.080 --> 01:43:45.239
OK.

01:43:45.239 --> 01:43:50.010
The flight dynamic officer is looking to see
if we get a good state vector on the board.

01:43:50.010 --> 01:43:51.820
He didn't see on the board.

01:43:51.820 --> 01:43:53.050
INCO said I sent it.

01:43:53.050 --> 01:43:54.219
What's going on?

01:43:54.219 --> 01:43:59.739
The data processing system officer reports
that the computers, both of them, the guidance

01:43:59.739 --> 01:44:05.139
and navigation computer and the system management
computer are clocking internal errors.

01:44:05.139 --> 01:44:06.690
They have a term for this.

01:44:06.690 --> 01:44:08.840
It's called divide by zero.

01:44:08.840 --> 01:44:10.780
Computers don't like to do that arithmetically.

01:44:10.780 --> 01:44:12.760
They send an alarm.

01:44:12.760 --> 01:44:15.750
The propulsion system officer reports continuous
jet firing.

01:44:15.750 --> 01:44:22.340
The guidance officer reports that they are
huge autopilot errors and high vehicle rates.

01:44:22.340 --> 01:44:25.809
When I said three degrees, I meant three degrees
a second, quite a lot.

01:44:25.809 --> 01:44:29.090
CAPCOM says wake up.

01:44:29.090 --> 01:44:34.139
CAPCOM, we need to tell the crew something
is going on.

01:44:34.139 --> 01:44:35.880
Wake the crew up.

01:44:35.880 --> 01:44:38.800
Voice link is normally disabled during crew
sleep.

01:44:38.800 --> 01:44:42.760
Because every once in a while somebody pushes
the button and wakes the crew up during crew

01:44:42.760 --> 01:44:45.949
sleep so we configure it so that we cannot
do it.

01:44:45.949 --> 01:44:52.870
So we had to reconfigure the ground voice
system to allow the CAPCOM to communicate.

01:44:52.870 --> 01:44:55.110
We lost the one satellite.

01:44:55.110 --> 01:44:57.110
We had the wrong antenna selecting.

01:44:57.110 --> 01:45:02.170
And then ten minutes everybody thought they
were dead.

01:45:02.170 --> 01:45:08.409
We woke the crew up, they put the vehicle
on manual mode and life returned to normal

01:45:08.409 --> 01:45:10.719
after the new state vector onboard.

01:45:10.719 --> 01:45:12.480
That never made the press, I don't think.

01:45:12.480 --> 01:45:15.110
It was directly caused by operator error.

01:45:15.110 --> 01:45:20.090
He clearly did things outside of what he was
trained to.

01:45:20.090 --> 01:45:24.360
And these are all nice little bureaucratic
words saying that everything worked like it

01:45:24.360 --> 01:45:29.110
was supposed to except for the guy.

01:45:29.110 --> 01:45:31.290
And here is what we did in our great bureaucratic
mode.

01:45:31.290 --> 01:45:32.750
Procedures were updated.

01:45:32.750 --> 01:45:33.989
Software was updated.

01:45:33.989 --> 01:45:35.070
Rules were updated.

01:45:35.070 --> 01:45:38.290
Consol handbook procedures were updated.

01:45:38.290 --> 01:45:44.210
Work guidelines of making people work ten
or twelve days in a row on nine or ten or

01:45:44.210 --> 01:45:49.940
twelve hour shifts, particularly on a nice
shift were revised so we let people off.

01:45:49.940 --> 01:45:54.929
And, basically, what we did was we added more
checks and balances to the system.

01:45:54.929 --> 01:45:59.620
Now, is that the kind of thing that you do
when you are designing a spacecraft?

01:45:59.620 --> 01:46:05.719
Why would you design a spacecraft where you
had to update the state vector every day?

01:46:05.719 --> 01:46:10.830
Why would you design a spacecraft that would
crash into the surface of Mars when it was

01:46:10.830 --> 01:46:15.320
supposed to go into orbit around Mars?

01:46:15.320 --> 01:46:19.550
You've got to be careful when you design your
system of the unintended consequences of your

01:46:19.550 --> 01:46:21.980
operation.

01:46:21.980 --> 01:46:26.059
And if you don't think very clearly about
what you're putting on the operators you'll

01:46:26.059 --> 01:46:30.100
force them into positions like this, so you've
got to think about the operation.

01:46:30.100 --> 01:46:37.000
Not just is the wing going to fall off because
the wind gust is going to exceed the structural

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:37.600
capability?

01:46:37.600 --> 01:46:39.710
You have to think about the operations.

01:46:39.710 --> 01:46:40.620
I've got one more.

01:46:40.620 --> 01:46:41.840
Do we have time for one more?

01:46:41.840 --> 01:46:43.469
If you can do it in two minutes.

01:46:43.469 --> 01:46:43.980
OK.

01:46:43.980 --> 01:46:50.489
This main engine combustion chamber, the main
engines have a computer that looks at sensors

01:46:50.489 --> 01:46:52.989
that controlled our mixture ratio and things.

01:46:52.989 --> 01:46:55.409
One of these sensors plugged up.

01:46:55.409 --> 01:46:57.030
And they give you the 30 second version.

01:46:57.030 --> 01:46:59.469
You can read it all.

01:46:59.469 --> 01:47:04.559
The ground had been using a pressure check
with a little pressure meter that had a Neoprene

01:47:04.559 --> 01:47:07.150
rubber O ring.

01:47:07.150 --> 01:47:13.670
And, when they pulled the pressure gauge off,
it left the Neoprene rubber there and stopped

01:47:13.670 --> 01:47:14.650
up the sensor.

01:47:14.650 --> 01:47:19.800
And, because of that, the engine nearly shut
down in flight.

01:47:19.800 --> 01:47:25.309
And, if Mission Control hadn't been paying
attention and disabled that sensor during

01:47:25.309 --> 01:47:30.719
real-time, we would have done our first return
to launch site abort on that engine.

01:47:30.719 --> 01:47:33.300
So, little things count for a lot.

01:47:33.300 --> 01:47:36.030
Small instrumentation things count for a lot.

01:47:36.030 --> 01:47:37.550
I hope this has been helpful to you.

01:47:37.550 --> 01:47:43.389
Anybody got any other questions before I sit
down?

01:47:43.389 --> 01:47:45.320
[APPLAUSE]

01:47:45.320 --> 01:47:51.380
One question from the back.

01:47:51.380 --> 01:47:54.409
[AUDIENCE QUESTION]

01:47:54.409 --> 01:48:01.409
Well, my thoughts are: I'm excited that NASA's
got the goal of going back to the Moon and

01:48:04.510 --> 01:48:09.580
Mars, I wish we'd never gotten away from that.

01:48:09.580 --> 01:48:14.350
I'm working really hard in the Space Shuttle
program to free up money so that exploration

01:48:14.350 --> 01:48:15.429
can do what it needs to do.

01:48:15.429 --> 01:48:21.050
I'm not in a position to know whether they've
got enough to do their job.

01:48:21.050 --> 01:48:24.880
It does look a little tight - I don't know,
time will tell.

01:48:24.880 --> 01:48:28.290
But I'm just excited to have the opportunity
to head in that direction.

01:48:28.290 --> 01:48:30.350
I'm going to give you the diplomatic answer.

01:48:30.350 --> 01:48:32.849
Chris is retired; I still have to go to work.

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:27.590
PROFESSOR: Hi.

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:29.960
In the reading
assignment for today,

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.700
you'll notice in the
textbook that the topic

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.556
is double integrals in
terms of polar coordinates.

00:00:36.556 --> 00:00:38.180
Now, the trouble with
polar coordinates

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:39.970
is that, aside from
straight lines,

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.250
they're perhaps the only
coordinate system that we've

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.760
studied in terms of Euclidean
geometry in a high school

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:47.650
class.

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:51.180
And consequently, if we were
to have a change of variables

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.840
other than strict linear
changes of variables

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.070
or polar coordinates,
it might be

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.150
difficult to geometrically
try to determine

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.480
what the new double integral
looks like with respect

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.900
to the new variables.

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.570
The text, you may recall, when
you-- or not you may recall,

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.036
you haven't read it yet--
but when you read the text,

00:01:11.036 --> 00:01:13.160
you'll notice at the end
that Professor Thomas says

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.290
there is a technique
called the Jacobian,

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.600
multiplying by the
Jacobian determinant,

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.300
that tells you how to
transfer a double integral

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.630
from x- and y-coordinates into
another coordinate system.

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.760
At any rate, with that
prolog as background,

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.560
our aim in today's
lecture is to show,

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.910
more generally, how
the Jacobian sneaks

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:37.820
into the study of
multiple integrals.

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.840
In particular, we call today's
lecture multiple integration

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.280
and the Jacobian.

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.290
And by way of review,
let me pick a problem

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.830
that we've solved in the
past in great detail,

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.120
but perhaps from a slightly
different perspective, that

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.490
will lead into where
the Jacobian matrix

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.260
and the Jacobian
determinant comes from.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.670
Recall that when we wanted to
compute the definite integral 1

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.330
to 3 2x squared root
of x squared plus 1 dx,

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:08.380
we made the substitution
u equals x squared plus 1.

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.440
Or, inverting this, x
equals positive square root

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:13.450
of u minus 1.

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.690
And I emphasize the
positive to point out

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.890
that in general, the inverse
of a squaring function

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.280
is not one-to-one.

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.780
See, the square root is
usually double valued.

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.400
But notice that with the
restriction that x must be

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.430
on the interval from 1 through
3, x cannot be negative.

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.090
And therefore, we certainly
can assume that locally,

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:36.710
meaning in the
region in which we're

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:39.930
interested in, that x is the
positive square root of u

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.040
minus 1.

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.190
From this we saw
that du was 2x*dx.

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.910
We then went back to
this equation here.

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.640
We replaced 2x*dx
by its value du.

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.730
We replaced the square
root of x squared

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.800
plus 1 by the square root of u.

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:01.100
And then noticing that when
x equaled 1, u equaled 2

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:06.420
and when x equaled 3, u equaled
10, we wound up with the fact

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.250
that the number named by
this definite integral

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.350
was the same as the number
named by this definite integral.

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:15.990
Now the only thing that I'd
like to say here, as an aside,

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:20.090
is the following: there
is sometimes a tendency

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:24.030
to think of dx as just
being a symbol over here,

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.630
that we think of it
as saying all we want

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:31.770
is a function whose derivative
with respect to x is this.

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:33.840
And that other than that,
it makes no difference

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:34.990
what we put in here.

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:37.220
What I would like you
to see at this time

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.020
and-- to review at this time
because we know it happens--

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:43.570
is that if we made the
substitutions mentioned here,

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:45.470
forgetting about the
dx-- in other words,

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:47.810
if we replaced x by the
positive square root of u

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:51.710
minus 1, if we replace
x squared plus 1 by u,

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:56.350
and if we replace the
limits 1 to 3 by 2 to 10,

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:00.600
and then just tacked on the du
to indicate that we were doing

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.880
this problem with respect to u,
the resulting definite integral

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:08.740
would not be equivalent
to the original one.

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:11.580
That is not to say that
this couldn't be computed.

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:17.620
What I mean is this number is
incorrect if by this number

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.240
you mean the value of this
definite integral here.

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:24.180
And notice that from a
pictorial point of view,

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:29.450
all we're really saying is that
the integral 1 to 3 2x squared

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:34.410
root of x squared plus 1 dx is
the area of the region R, where

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:38.470
R is that region in the xy-plane
bounded between the lines

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:43.540
x equals 1, x equals
3, below by the x-axis,

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:46.500
and above by the curve
y equals 2x times

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.180
the square root of
x squared plus 1.

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.870
And I've simply put the
values of these endpoints

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:54.980
in here-- namely when x is
1, y is 2 square roots of 2,

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:57.600
when x is 3, y is 6
square roots of 10--

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.180
to give you sort
of an orientation

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:00.900
of this particular curve.

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:04.460
On the other hand, that other
integral that was incorrect--

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:07.290
integral from 2
to 10, et cetera--

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:10.510
is the area of
the region S where

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:14.760
S is the region that's obtained
by taking that integral

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:19.570
from 1 to 3 along the
x-axis, mapping it by u

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:21.560
equals x squared plus
1-- in other words,

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.974
it goes from 2 to 10.

00:05:23.974 --> 00:05:25.890
And in fact, you don't
even have to know that.

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:28.390
All I'm saying is, if you just
read this thing mechanically,

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:32.840
in the yu-plane, this would
be the area of the region S

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:38.050
where S is bounded vertically
by the lines u equal 2

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:40.930
and u equal 10,
below by the u-axis

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:43.870
and above by the curve y
equals twice square root

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:46.040
u minus 1 square root of u.

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:48.330
And it should be
clear by inspection

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:50.390
that there is no
reason to expect

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:53.160
that the area of the
region R is the same

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:58.270
as the area of the region S even
though both R and S have areas.

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:01.120
Now, what the whole
geometrical impact

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:05.430
is on this technique
of integration,

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:08.103
techniques of integration, what
the whole geometric impact is

00:06:08.103 --> 00:06:09.790
is this.

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:14.110
This is a difficult integral
to evaluate to find the area.

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:17.530
Hopefully, one
would hope that we

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:22.290
could find a way of
scaling an element of area

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:27.430
here to correspond to
an element of area here

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:30.070
which was easier to compute.

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:32.560
And that since the
mapping was one to one,

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:36.410
by adding up the appropriately
scaled pieces here,

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:38.760
we equivalently
add up the pieces

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:40.780
to find the area
of the region R.

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:43.420
Now, because I know that
sounds vague to you,

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:46.170
I am going to do that
in much more detail.

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:48.840
For the time being, let
me point out, though,

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:51.470
that if I want to view
this as a mapping,

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:57.690
the interesting thing is
that any point on the x-axis

00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:01.780
maps into the corresponding
point on the u-axis

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:03.410
by the mapping what?

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:05.780
u equals x squared plus 1.

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:09.740
But it's important to point
out that the values of x and u

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:11.540
were not independent.

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:14.700
They were chosen to obey
the identity u equals

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:17.850
x squared plus 1, or x is
the positive square root

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:19.160
of u minus 1.

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:21.430
So what that means
geometrically is

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:26.210
that whatever height was
above a point in the region R

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:28.920
along the x-axis--
whatever height was here--

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:31.600
that height is the
same when that point is

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:33.290
moved to the region S.

00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:36.280
Because that again sounds
like a difficult mouthful,

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:37.330
let me write that.

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:41.380
All I'm saying is, notice
that for the u corresponding

00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:46.720
to a given x, 2x times the
square root of x squared plus 1

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:50.680
is equal to 2 times the
square root of u minus 1

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:52.100
times the square root of u.

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:53.080
How do I know that?

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:55.990
Well, I know that
because I picked x to be

00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:58.190
the square root of u minus 1.

00:07:58.190 --> 00:08:01.320
Or equivalently what? u
equals x squared plus 1.

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:04.250
This says that I can replace
x by the square root of u

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:05.260
minus 1.

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:08.380
This says I can replace
x squared plus 1 by u.

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:12.320
Consequently, as long as the
x matches with the image u,

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:15.810
this number is the
same as this number.

00:08:15.810 --> 00:08:18.100
In other words again,
in terms of a picture,

00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:24.390
if I start with the point
on the x-axis x equals 2

00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:27.930
and I'm looking at the point P,
being the point on the region

00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:31.530
R directly above x
equals 2, since 2

00:08:31.530 --> 00:08:34.049
gets mapped into
5 by the mapping u

00:08:34.049 --> 00:08:36.020
equals x squared plus
1-- see 2 squared

00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:39.480
plus 1 is 5-- what was the
height that went with the point

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:40.679
2 over here?

00:08:40.679 --> 00:08:42.640
The height that went with
the point 2 over here

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:44.100
was simply what?

00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:47.100
4 square roots of 5.

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:50.790
And I claim that that's the same
as this, because when x was 2,

00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:52.070
u is 5.

00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:54.890
This is 2 square roots of 5.

00:08:54.890 --> 00:08:56.480
5 minus 1 is 4.

00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:58.030
Square root of 4 is 2.

00:08:58.030 --> 00:09:01.510
This is 4, therefore-- 2
times 2-- 4 square roots of 5.

00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:04.210
It makes no difference whether
your using the x or the u,

00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:07.480
but that the point
keeps the same height.

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:11.880
It shifted laterally, but it
does not distort the height.

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:16.500
Which means, now, if we want
to view this not as a mapping

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:22.070
from xy-plane into the uy-plane
but more traditionally in terms

00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:25.870
of the xy-plane into the
uv-plane, that's what

00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:27.570
this v is in parentheses here.

00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:31.780
It means that I might want to
name the y-axis the v-axis just

00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:34.680
so that I can use my
identification established

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:36.400
in the previous
block in our course,

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:40.820
when we talked about mapping
the xy-plane into the uv-plane.

00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:43.370
That is not an accent
mark over the v. That just

00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:45.840
happens to be an interruption
of this arrow that

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:47.450
connects 2 to 5.

00:09:47.450 --> 00:09:50.070
But at any rate, in
terms of mappings,

00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:54.100
notice that the region R
is mapped onto the region S

00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:59.450
by the mapping u equals x
squared plus 1 and v equals y.

00:09:59.450 --> 00:10:01.980
In other words, u
equals x squared plus 1.

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:06.290
But the y-coordinate is the
same as the v-coordinate.

00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:07.870
Just changing the
name of the axis

00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:11.010
here to correspond
to the uv-plane.

00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:14.890
And now, the idea
is simply this.

00:10:14.890 --> 00:10:17.270
Since-- at least in
the domain that we're

00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:20.880
interested in-- the mapping
u equals x squared plus 1,

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:26.190
v equals y maps R onto S
in a one-to-one manner,

00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:29.250
each increment of
area delta A sub S

00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:33.460
matches one and only
one delta A sub R.

00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:36.670
Let me give you an example
of what I mean by this.

00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:39.210
Let's suppose I start
with the region S

00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:42.450
and let me arbitrarily
divide it up into a number--

00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:45.460
the interval from 2 to 10--
into a number of pieces here.

00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:48.140
Oh, I guess in the diagram
that I've used here,

00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:51.510
I've divided this up into
four pieces, all right.

00:10:51.510 --> 00:10:55.780
So I get these four
little rectangles.

00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:58.860
An approximation for
the area of the region S

00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:01.500
would be the sum of the areas
of these four rectangles.

00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:04.890
What I'm saying is
that under our mapping,

00:11:04.890 --> 00:11:11.190
these four regions induce four
mutually exclusive regions that

00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:14.460
cover all of R. In
fact, since v equals

00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:18.210
y, the way we do this
mechanically is-- for example,

00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:21.920
let's focus on just one of
these little elements over here.

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:28.610
Let's suppose I want to find how
to match this shaded rectangle

00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:33.710
with a suitable rectangle
of R. What I said

00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:36.650
is whatever the
v-value is over here,

00:11:36.650 --> 00:11:39.230
it must be the
same as the y-value

00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:42.360
of the point that mapped
into this point on the axis.

00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:45.440
In other words, if I
call this point here u_0,

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:50.280
that comes from some point
here which I'll call x_0.

00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:51.990
See u_0 comes from x_0.

00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:54.560
What must the height
above this point be?

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:58.610
Since the transformation does
not change the y-value at all,

00:11:58.610 --> 00:12:02.310
since v equals y, what this
means is I can now draw a line

00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:06.040
parallel to the u-axis
here, come over to here,

00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:09.720
and that locates
where on the curve

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:11.710
I'm going to locate
the point x_0.

00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:13.930
See, in other words,
I just come across

00:12:13.930 --> 00:12:15.560
like this, either
of these two ways.

00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:18.960
This is how I locate the
x_0 that matches the u_0.

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:22.290
I take its height, take that
same height over to this curve,

00:12:22.290 --> 00:12:23.870
and project down.

00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:27.270
Notice, of course,
that the delta x

00:12:27.270 --> 00:12:30.030
that measures the difference
between these two points

00:12:30.030 --> 00:12:33.640
on the x-axis is not the
same as the delta u that

00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:35.870
measures the distance
between these two points.

00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:39.960
But what I want you to see is
that these four rectangles here

00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:43.100
induce four rectangles here.

00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:45.410
And what I would
like to be able to do

00:12:45.410 --> 00:12:50.040
is somehow be able,
hopefully, to find out

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:53.900
how to express a
typical rectangle here

00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:57.240
as a scaled version of
one of these rectangles,

00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:59.740
hoping that when I
then take the sum

00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:03.030
the resulting summation
leads to an integral

00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:04.990
which is easy to evaluate.

00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:07.120
And before I get into
that, to show you

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:08.690
what does happen
here-- I think I'm

00:13:08.690 --> 00:13:11.210
making this longer than it may
really seem-- but let me just

00:13:11.210 --> 00:13:12.850
get onto the next step.

00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:17.410
What I want to do next is to
blow up these two shaded areas,

00:13:17.410 --> 00:13:19.750
so I can look at
them in more detail.

00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:22.550
What I have is a region
which I'll call delta

00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:25.550
A sub S in the
uv-plane and a delta

00:13:25.550 --> 00:13:30.280
A sub R in the xy-plane, where
the mapping is, again, what?

00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:33.750
u equals x squared
plus 1, v equals y.

00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:36.690
This piece matches
with this piece.

00:13:36.690 --> 00:13:37.400
All right.

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:41.010
Now, for small delta u,
notice that by definition

00:13:41.010 --> 00:13:44.070
of derivative, delta
x divided by delta u

00:13:44.070 --> 00:13:46.170
is approximately dx/du.

00:13:46.170 --> 00:13:50.330
Consequently, I can say that
delta x is approximately dx/du

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:51.890
times du.

00:13:51.890 --> 00:13:53.400
Now, the thing
that I really want

00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:56.330
is not the area
of a piece of S, I

00:13:56.330 --> 00:14:00.390
want a portion of the area
of R. I want delta A sub R.

00:14:00.390 --> 00:14:06.020
Notice that delta A sub R
has as its height y sub 0

00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:08.770
and as its width delta x.

00:14:08.770 --> 00:14:13.710
Notice also that since
v sub 0 equals y sub 0--

00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:18.370
see y equals v in this
transformation-- notice

00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:26.201
that the area delta A_R
is v_0 times delta x.

00:14:26.201 --> 00:14:26.700
OK.

00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:30.660
We also know that delta x is
approximately dx/du times delta

00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:31.350
u.

00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:33.620
So making this
substitution, I see

00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:37.260
that my little increment
of area in the region R

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:38.630
is precisely what?

00:14:38.630 --> 00:14:44.420
It's v_0 times the replacement
for delta x, dx/du times

00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:45.720
delta u.

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:50.840
Let me also notice that the
region delta A_S over here

00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:55.410
has as its height v_0,
as its base delta u.

00:14:55.410 --> 00:15:00.210
So the area of this
rectangle is v_0 delta u.

00:15:00.210 --> 00:15:03.550
Let me, therefore, group
these two factors together,

00:15:03.550 --> 00:15:06.650
rewrite this term
in this fashion,

00:15:06.650 --> 00:15:11.310
noticing that v_0 delta u
is delta A sub S. And I now

00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:16.240
have the very interesting
result that delta A sub R is not

00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:19.500
delta A sub S. But the
correction factor is what?

00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:23.970
It's dx/du multiplying
delta A sub S where,

00:15:23.970 --> 00:15:26.340
for the sake of argument over
a small enough strip here,

00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:31.060
let me assume that I've chosen
dx/du to be evaluated at u

00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:33.400
equals u_0, say.

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:35.540
At any rate, what
we are saying is,

00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:37.750
to find all of the
area of region R,

00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:40.170
we want to add up all
of these delta A sub

00:15:40.170 --> 00:15:44.120
R's as the maximum
delta x sub k goes to 0.

00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:48.850
But from what we've just
seen, a typical delta A sub R

00:15:48.850 --> 00:15:52.700
is a dx/du, evaluated
at u equals u_0,

00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:55.300
times delta A sub
S. And therefore,

00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:59.360
to find delta A sub R, this
limit is precisely the same

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:00.750
as this limit.

00:16:00.750 --> 00:16:04.420
Now the point is that
delta A sub S is certainly

00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:07.280
just as messy as delta
A sub R, in general.

00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:10.550
It may also happened that
when I scale delta A sub

00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:15.800
S by multiplying it by dx/du,
the result is even more messy

00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:17.990
than the original expression.

00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:21.350
But it's also
possible that dx/du

00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:23.950
happens to be the
factor that wipes

00:16:23.950 --> 00:16:27.440
out the nasty part of delta A
sub S. You see, what I'm saying

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:30.820
is, if there is a one-to-one
correspondence-- which there

00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:34.690
is-- between the delta
A_S's and the delta A_R's,

00:16:34.690 --> 00:16:37.910
if this expression here
happens to be convenient,

00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:43.760
I can find this sum simply
by computing this sum.

00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:45.850
And that's why, in
techniques of integration,

00:16:45.850 --> 00:16:47.710
that's precisely
what we look for.

00:16:47.710 --> 00:16:50.940
We look for the change of
variable, the substitution,

00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:52.820
that makes this thing simplify.

00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:54.760
And that's precisely
what happened

00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:55.940
in this particular example.

00:16:55.940 --> 00:16:58.910
Keep in mind that what
I've written down over here

00:16:58.910 --> 00:17:03.160
is true for any substitution
where x is some function of u,

00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:05.680
not just for x equals
u squared plus 1.

00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:07.119
I could've done this any time.

00:17:07.119 --> 00:17:09.369
But what I claim is
that if x weren't

00:17:09.369 --> 00:17:12.819
equal to-- what was it-- the
square root of u minus 1,

00:17:12.819 --> 00:17:16.625
this wouldn't have turned out
to be a very nice expression.

00:17:16.625 --> 00:17:18.250
And you see, this is
going to be called

00:17:18.250 --> 00:17:20.150
the one-dimensional
Jacobian later on.

00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:22.990
This is the correction factor,
the scaling factor, you see.

00:17:22.990 --> 00:17:24.770
Let's see how that worked out.

00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:30.020
Notice that delta A sub
S was v_0 times delta u.

00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:33.180
And notice that by definition
of what the curve looked

00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:38.060
like in the uv-plane, v_0 is
twice the square root of u_0

00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:41.200
minus 1 times the
square root of u_0.

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:43.850
On the other hand,
what is dx/du?

00:17:43.850 --> 00:17:46.550
Since u is equal to
x squared plus 1,

00:17:46.550 --> 00:17:50.620
it's easy to show that
dx/du is 1 over twice

00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:52.710
the square root of u minus 1.

00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:55.190
So in particular,
when u equals u_0,

00:17:55.190 --> 00:18:00.320
dx/du is 1 over 2 square
root of u_0 minus 1.

00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:04.340
Notice now, even though
delta A sub S is quite messy,

00:18:04.340 --> 00:18:07.660
when I multiply it by this
particular scaling factor,

00:18:07.660 --> 00:18:09.920
look at what that
scaling factor wipes out.

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:13.740
The 2 square root of u_0
minus 1 wipes this out.

00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:17.660
All I have left is the square
root of u_0 times delta u.

00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:21.200
When I form the definite
integral summing this thing up,

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:24.230
it's trivial, you see,
to see that that simply

00:18:24.230 --> 00:18:25.630
comes out to be what?

00:18:25.630 --> 00:18:30.120
The definite integral from
2 to 10 square root of u du.

00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:34.370
And since this particular
sum was equal to A sub R,

00:18:34.370 --> 00:18:37.830
that is the mapping
interpretation

00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:41.230
of why the area of the
region R can be evaluated

00:18:41.230 --> 00:18:42.900
by this particular integral.

00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:45.790
Now, in a sense, all of
this has been review,

00:18:45.790 --> 00:18:48.640
even though the pitch has
been slightly different.

00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:53.010
Let me now generalize this
to a bona fide mapping

00:18:53.010 --> 00:18:55.800
of two-dimensional space
into two-dimensional space.

00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:57.990
And the reason I use
the word bona fide

00:18:57.990 --> 00:19:01.450
is that when you say let
u equal x squared plus 1

00:19:01.450 --> 00:19:04.070
and let v equal y,
you really haven't

00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:06.860
got a general mapping
of two-dimensional space

00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:08.230
into two-dimensional space.

00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:11.480
You've essentially let
the y-axis remain fixed.

00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:13.880
So let me talk about
something more general.

00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:15.660
Let's suppose I have
an arbitrary region

00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:20.330
R and an arbitrary
function f bar which maps R

00:19:20.330 --> 00:19:24.320
onto S in a one-to-one manner.

00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:26.530
By the way, notice,
the whole idea is this.

00:19:26.530 --> 00:19:29.070
When I want the area
of the region R,

00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:33.260
it's going to involve a dx*dy
inside the double integral.

00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:35.660
When I want the area
of the region S,

00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:39.790
that's what's going to involve
a delta u times delta v. Now

00:19:39.790 --> 00:19:42.300
the reason that
delta u times delta v

00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:45.240
is indeed a bona
fide element of area

00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:48.730
when we're breaking up
S lies in the fact that,

00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:51.660
in the uv-plane,
delta u times delta

00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:59.060
v is the actual area of
an increment of area in S,

00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:03.370
when we break up S by lines
parallel to the u and v axis.

00:20:03.370 --> 00:20:05.310
On the other hand,
notice that if we

00:20:05.310 --> 00:20:08.940
see what the line u equals
a constant comes from, back

00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:12.280
in the xy-plane, u is
a function of x and y.

00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:14.457
And to say that u of
x, y equals a constant

00:20:14.457 --> 00:20:16.290
does not mean that you
have a straight line.

00:20:16.290 --> 00:20:19.010
You could have some pretty
squiggly lines over here.

00:20:19.010 --> 00:20:22.560
In other words, it might be
a very funny-looking line

00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:25.490
that maps into a straight
line, a straight vertical line,

00:20:25.490 --> 00:20:28.820
in the uv-plane with respect
to the mapping f bar.

00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:31.030
And in a similar
way, the lines v

00:20:31.030 --> 00:20:34.690
equal a constant--
the lines v equal

00:20:34.690 --> 00:20:38.350
a constant-- in the xy-plane,
are read what? v of x, y

00:20:38.350 --> 00:20:39.450
equals a constant.

00:20:39.450 --> 00:20:41.610
That's a general
curve in the xy-plane.

00:20:41.610 --> 00:20:44.780
What we're saying is that, since
this mapping is one to one,

00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:49.410
when I break up this region
into elementary elements

00:20:49.410 --> 00:20:52.800
of rectangles, that will
induce a breaking up

00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:55.980
of this region into
little elements here.

00:20:55.980 --> 00:20:58.100
But notice that the
resulting elements-- say

00:20:58.100 --> 00:21:00.830
we take a piece like
this, and we see

00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:02.180
where that piece comes from.

00:21:02.180 --> 00:21:03.840
Let's say that that
particular piece

00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:06.340
happened to come from here.

00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:09.770
Say that that was the
one-to-one correspondence.

00:21:09.770 --> 00:21:12.620
You can take delta u
times delta v here.

00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:15.490
But notice that
delta u times delta v

00:21:15.490 --> 00:21:19.930
simply means multiplying
two edges which

00:21:19.930 --> 00:21:22.150
aren't straight lines,
which aren't necessarily

00:21:22.150 --> 00:21:23.920
perpendicular, and
hence in no way

00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:27.530
should represent what the area
of this little element here is.

00:21:27.530 --> 00:21:31.120
The key point is we do not
want the area of the region S.

00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:33.750
We want the area
of the region R.

00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:35.670
And what we're
hoping that we can

00:21:35.670 --> 00:21:38.760
do is that by making the
change of variables that

00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:41.310
maps the region
R in the xy-plane

00:21:41.310 --> 00:21:44.910
into the region S
in the uv-plane,

00:21:44.910 --> 00:21:48.790
that we somehow find a
convenient way of scaling

00:21:48.790 --> 00:21:51.790
an individual
element of area here

00:21:51.790 --> 00:21:56.180
with respect to one here, and
define the area of this region

00:21:56.180 --> 00:21:59.130
by adding up the
appropriate pieces here.

00:21:59.130 --> 00:22:02.550
And, again, let me show you
what that means in terms

00:22:02.550 --> 00:22:04.960
of just an enlargement again.

00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:06.830
You see, in the same
as I did before,

00:22:06.830 --> 00:22:09.580
let me take this little piece
over here and really blow it

00:22:09.580 --> 00:22:10.300
up.

00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:12.990
Let me take this
little piece that

00:22:12.990 --> 00:22:14.700
is the back-map of
this-- in other words,

00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:18.220
the piece that maps into
this-- let me blow that up.

00:22:18.220 --> 00:22:20.830
And the idea is this.

00:22:20.830 --> 00:22:24.790
If I pick delta u and
delta v sufficiently small,

00:22:24.790 --> 00:22:29.490
notice that the area of the
back-map of delta A sub S

00:22:29.490 --> 00:22:32.520
is approximately the
area of a parallelogram.

00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:35.440
You see, come back
to this statement

00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:37.250
after I've explained
the picture.

00:22:37.250 --> 00:22:40.770
What I'm saying is I start with
an element of area delta A sub

00:22:40.770 --> 00:22:43.200
S in the uv-plane.

00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:44.820
You see, I pick its vertices.

00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:49.090
I'll call them A bar,
B bar, D bar, C bar.

00:22:49.090 --> 00:22:51.490
That's a little
rectangle over here.

00:22:51.490 --> 00:22:53.530
Because the mapping
is one-to-one,

00:22:53.530 --> 00:22:57.240
I know that there is one and
only one point in the xy-plane

00:22:57.240 --> 00:22:59.480
that maps into A bar.

00:22:59.480 --> 00:22:59.980
See that?

00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:01.820
Let's call that
point A. There is

00:23:01.820 --> 00:23:05.330
one and only one point in the
xy-plane that maps into B bar.

00:23:05.330 --> 00:23:07.820
Let's call that B.
One and only one

00:23:07.820 --> 00:23:10.870
point in the xy-plane
that maps into C bar.

00:23:10.870 --> 00:23:14.080
Let's call that point C. And
let me leave the point D out

00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:15.230
for a moment.

00:23:15.230 --> 00:23:19.050
Now the idea is if we call the
coordinates of A bar u_0 comma

00:23:19.050 --> 00:23:23.760
v_0, then because this is a
line parallel to the axis--

00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:29.230
call this dimension delta u--
B bar is u_0 plus delta u comma

00:23:29.230 --> 00:23:30.400
v_0.

00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:32.490
C bar-- call this
dimension delta

00:23:32.490 --> 00:23:37.480
v-- is u_0 comma v_0 plus
delta v. Now the point

00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:41.470
is, there is no reason
why the image of B

00:23:41.470 --> 00:23:48.310
bar-- namely the point B--
has to be on the line that

00:23:48.310 --> 00:23:51.120
joins A parallel to the x-axis.

00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:53.470
In other words, B is
up here someplace,

00:23:53.470 --> 00:23:55.290
C is up here some place.

00:23:55.290 --> 00:23:58.440
In other words, again, there's
no reason why these back-maps

00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:01.190
give me a rectangle over here.

00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:03.320
The point is that B
has some coordinates.

00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:06.060
It's x_0 plus some
increment involving

00:24:06.060 --> 00:24:09.550
x-- let me call that delta
x_1-- and its y-coordinate

00:24:09.550 --> 00:24:12.550
is y_0 plus delta y_1.

00:24:12.550 --> 00:24:17.190
C is the point x_0 plus some
increment delta x_2 comma

00:24:17.190 --> 00:24:19.740
y_0 plus delta y_2.

00:24:19.740 --> 00:24:22.960
And what I'm saying is
now, if I were to just look

00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:30.010
at the parallelogram which had
AB and AC as adjacent sides,

00:24:30.010 --> 00:24:33.810
it's very easy for me to find
the area of that parallelogram.

00:24:33.810 --> 00:24:36.790
Namely, to find the area of a
parallelogram in vector form,

00:24:36.790 --> 00:24:39.660
I just take the magnitude of
the cross-product of the two

00:24:39.660 --> 00:24:42.330
vectors AB and AC.

00:24:42.330 --> 00:24:44.400
You see, what's
wrong with this is

00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:47.280
that that particular
parallelogram is not

00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:51.300
the exact image of the
back-map of delta A_S.

00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:55.480
Sure, A bar maps exactly
into A. C bar maps

00:24:55.480 --> 00:25:00.860
exactly into C. B bar
maps exactly into B.

00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:05.690
But the point is that these
points along A bar C bar

00:25:05.690 --> 00:25:11.500
do not map into the straight
line from A to C, in general.

00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:14.680
In other words, what
characterizes this?

00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:17.570
This is characterized
by delta u equals 0.

00:25:17.570 --> 00:25:21.280
And when u is written
in terms of x and y,

00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:24.900
that doesn't say that
delta x or delta y is 0.

00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:28.280
So, the true image
of this might be

00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:32.380
what I've represented with
this dotted array here.

00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:34.920
In other words, what the
true back-map of delta A is

00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:38.860
is this dotted thing, where
D is now this vertex here.

00:25:38.860 --> 00:25:42.620
You see, there's no guarantee
that the back-map of D bar

00:25:42.620 --> 00:25:46.090
is going to be the fourth
vertex of this parallelogram.

00:25:46.090 --> 00:25:47.780
But what the key
point is-- and this

00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:50.140
is where that linearity
is so important--

00:25:50.140 --> 00:25:53.320
is that if the transformation
is smooth enough, continuously

00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:56.370
differentiable, then
what it does mean

00:25:56.370 --> 00:26:00.460
is that as long as delta u and
delta v are sufficiently small,

00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:04.200
the true area of
the region delta

00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:07.000
A_R that we're looking
for is approximately

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.790
equal to the area of
this parallelogram.

00:26:09.790 --> 00:26:11.940
And by approximately
equal, I mean what?

00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:14.730
That the error goes to
0 as we take the limit

00:26:14.730 --> 00:26:16.305
in forming the double sum.

00:26:16.305 --> 00:26:19.990
In other words, again,
the key point is this.

00:26:19.990 --> 00:26:25.610
The back-map of delta A
sub S yields delta A_R,

00:26:25.610 --> 00:26:28.880
but that delta A_R
is approximately

00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:30.590
this parallelogram.

00:26:30.590 --> 00:26:32.930
And the area of
this parallelogram

00:26:32.930 --> 00:26:36.840
is exactly the magnitude
of AB-- the vector

00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:39.915
AB-- crossed with AC.

00:26:39.915 --> 00:26:41.440
In other words,
the approximation

00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:46.350
comes in because this is exactly
the area of the parallelogram.

00:26:46.350 --> 00:26:50.490
But delta A sub R is only
approximately equal to the area

00:26:50.490 --> 00:26:51.700
of the parallelogram.

00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:54.770
At any rate, notice in
terms of i and j components,

00:26:54.770 --> 00:26:58.420
how easy it is to
compute AB and AC.

00:26:58.420 --> 00:27:01.180
You see, what are the components
of the vector from A to B?

00:27:01.180 --> 00:27:03.370
The i component is delta x_1.

00:27:03.370 --> 00:27:04.840
See, this minus this.

00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:10.020
The j component is
this minus this, right.

00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:12.700
In other words, AC has
what as its components?

00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:15.700
It's this minus this,
namely delta x_2.

00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:17.990
This minus this is
the y-component.

00:27:17.990 --> 00:27:19.249
That's delta y_2.

00:27:19.249 --> 00:27:20.790
In other words-- to
write this out so

00:27:20.790 --> 00:27:23.750
you don't have to listen
to how fast I'm talking--

00:27:23.750 --> 00:27:26.020
AB is this particular vector.

00:27:26.020 --> 00:27:28.500
AC is this particular vector.

00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:31.040
Remembering that when
we take a cross-product,

00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:37.060
i crossed i is 0, j cross
j is 0, i cross j is k,

00:27:37.060 --> 00:27:39.142
and j cross i is minus k.

00:27:39.142 --> 00:27:40.600
Remember, for the
cross-product, we

00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:42.571
can't change the
order of the terms

00:27:42.571 --> 00:27:44.070
from the order in
which they appear.

00:27:44.070 --> 00:27:45.940
We then determined what?

00:27:45.940 --> 00:27:50.100
That AB cross AC is
delta x_1 delta y_2

00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:54.740
minus delta x_2 delta y_1 times
the vector k, the unit vector

00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:56.440
in the z direction.

00:27:56.440 --> 00:28:00.722
Now, delta x_1 is
exactly-- see, remember,

00:28:00.722 --> 00:28:02.430
we're looking at the
parallelogram, which

00:28:02.430 --> 00:28:03.260
is a straight line.

00:28:03.260 --> 00:28:05.590
If you want to think of it
in terms of the region R,

00:28:05.590 --> 00:28:08.740
by differentials delta
x_1 would be what?

00:28:08.740 --> 00:28:11.700
It's approximately the
partial of x with respect to u

00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:14.950
times delta u plus the partial
of x with respect to v times

00:28:14.950 --> 00:28:19.700
delta v. Similarly, delta
y_1 is y sub u times delta

00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:22.690
u plus y sub v times delta v.

00:28:22.690 --> 00:28:27.940
But now keep in mind where delta
x_1 and delta y_1 come from.

00:28:27.940 --> 00:28:32.070
Delta x_1 and delta y_1
come from the back mapping

00:28:32.070 --> 00:28:35.540
from A bar B bar back to AB.

00:28:35.540 --> 00:28:41.240
And along A bar B bar, notice
that v is always equal to v_0.

00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:43.700
So that means that delta v is 0.

00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:47.350
That means, therefore,
that because delta v is 0,

00:28:47.350 --> 00:28:51.440
delta x_1 and delta
y_1 are simply this.

00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:52.750
See this drops out.

00:28:52.750 --> 00:28:55.420
Similarly, delta
x_2 and delta y_2

00:28:55.420 --> 00:28:58.370
come from the back-map
of A bar A bar.

00:28:58.370 --> 00:29:01.530
Along A bar C bar,
u is equal to u_0.

00:29:01.530 --> 00:29:03.130
So delta u is zero.

00:29:03.130 --> 00:29:05.730
So writing this
out, these drop out.

00:29:05.730 --> 00:29:09.680
And now, with these terms being
0, with these terms being 0,

00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:13.500
I could very simply compute
the product delta x_1 delta

00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:16.360
y_2 minus delta x_2 delta y_1.

00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:21.280
And if I do that, you see, right
away what I obtain is what?

00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:23.910
It's this times this.

00:29:23.910 --> 00:29:29.290
I now, OK, collect
the terms here.

00:29:29.290 --> 00:29:32.530
In other words, I want the delta
u and the delta v together.

00:29:32.530 --> 00:29:34.840
The multiplier out
front here is x

00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:39.560
sub u times y sub v. In a
similar way, delta x_2 times

00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:42.930
delta y_1 is x sub v
y sub u times delta u

00:29:42.930 --> 00:29:48.370
delta v. Therefore, putting that
into here, the magnitude of AB

00:29:48.370 --> 00:29:52.390
cross AC is simply
this expression here,

00:29:52.390 --> 00:29:56.630
noticing that the k vector drops
out because its magnitude is 1.

00:29:56.630 --> 00:30:01.810
Notice that delta u times delta
v is precisely delta A sub S

00:30:01.810 --> 00:30:05.110
and that x sub u
times y sub v minus x

00:30:05.110 --> 00:30:09.270
sub v times y sub u is
precisely the determinant

00:30:09.270 --> 00:30:12.010
of our old friend
the Jacobian matrix,

00:30:12.010 --> 00:30:14.850
the Jacobian matrix of x
and y with respect to u

00:30:14.850 --> 00:30:19.040
and v. In other words, delta
A sub R is approximately

00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:22.350
equal to the determinant
of the Jacobian matrix of x

00:30:22.350 --> 00:30:25.820
and y with respect to u
and v times delta A_S.

00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:30.230
And if I now perform this double
sum, you see this becomes what?

00:30:30.230 --> 00:30:33.390
The area of the region R-- just
write that in, that's really

00:30:33.390 --> 00:30:38.140
the area of the region R-- is
a double integral over R dx*dy.

00:30:38.140 --> 00:30:39.610
And that's the same as what?

00:30:39.610 --> 00:30:45.980
The double integral over S times
du*dv multiplied by the scaling

00:30:45.980 --> 00:30:48.710
factor of the
Jacobian determinant.

00:30:48.710 --> 00:30:53.490
By the way, notice I dropped the
determinant symbol over here.

00:30:53.490 --> 00:30:57.830
The reason for that is that many
textbooks, including our own,

00:30:57.830 --> 00:31:02.770
use this notation not to name
the Jacobian matrix but to name

00:31:02.770 --> 00:31:04.250
the Jacobian determinant.

00:31:04.250 --> 00:31:07.940
I have been using this to
name the Jacobian matrix.

00:31:07.940 --> 00:31:11.480
From this point on, I will
now switch to become uniform

00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:12.390
with the text.

00:31:12.390 --> 00:31:14.510
And unless otherwise
specified, I

00:31:14.510 --> 00:31:17.890
will write this rather than
put the determinant symbol in.

00:31:17.890 --> 00:31:20.690
From now on in our
course, when I write this

00:31:20.690 --> 00:31:26.330
I am referring to the
Jacobian determinant, OK.

00:31:26.330 --> 00:31:27.730
But the thing is this.

00:31:27.730 --> 00:31:30.580
Notice that the given
mapping might straighten out

00:31:30.580 --> 00:31:33.180
the region R into a
nicer-looking region

00:31:33.180 --> 00:31:36.840
S. But to offset
this, it may also

00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:40.290
turn out that the
resulting integrand here

00:31:40.290 --> 00:31:42.280
is much worse than
the integrand here.

00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:47.670
Here the multiplier of dx*dy was
the simple number 1, wasn't it?

00:31:47.670 --> 00:31:51.010
Here, what's multiplying
du*dv, no matter how nice S is,

00:31:51.010 --> 00:31:54.620
is this expression here,
which may be quite messy.

00:31:54.620 --> 00:31:57.440
And therefore, in most
practical applications

00:31:57.440 --> 00:32:00.380
where one solves
multiple integrals

00:32:00.380 --> 00:32:02.750
by a change of
variable, one not only

00:32:02.750 --> 00:32:05.590
wants a change of variables
that straightens out

00:32:05.590 --> 00:32:07.750
the region into a
nicer-looking one,

00:32:07.750 --> 00:32:09.680
he wants a combination
of two things.

00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:12.210
He would like a
nicer-looking region.

00:32:12.210 --> 00:32:14.610
And more importantly,
even if he can't

00:32:14.610 --> 00:32:16.830
get a nicer-looking
region, at least

00:32:16.830 --> 00:32:20.890
if he gets a correction factor,
a Jacobian determinant, that

00:32:20.890 --> 00:32:23.580
gives him something
that's easy to integrate,

00:32:23.580 --> 00:32:24.960
he'll settle for that.

00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:27.580
And what that means,
hopefully, will become clearer

00:32:27.580 --> 00:32:30.890
as we go through the exercises
and the reading material.

00:32:30.890 --> 00:32:32.540
At any rate, I
think that's all I

00:32:32.540 --> 00:32:35.690
want to say about a supplement
to Professor Thomas's

00:32:35.690 --> 00:32:37.910
treatment of polar
coordinates at this time.

00:32:37.910 --> 00:32:39.960
And until next time,
then, good bye.

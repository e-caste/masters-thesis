00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
I just wanted to briefly remind
you of some of the periodic

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
trends that we talked about.
As you go across the periodic

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
table, both the electron
affinity and the ionization

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
energy increase.
They increase because the

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:44.000
nuclear charge increases.
Remember, the potential energy

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000
of interaction is Z times e,
where that is the nuclear

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
charges, times e over 4 pi
epsilon nought r.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Z increases as you go across
the periodic table here.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
As you go across,
r is remaining the same because

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
you are essentially still in the
same shell.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
And so what increases is that
attractive interaction,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
meaning the electrons are more
strongly bound,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
meaning ionization energy and
electron affinity increases as

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
you go across.
And this also means,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
as you go across,
r, the radius decreases.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
The radius decreases again
because Z increases.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
The nucleus is pulling the
electrons in closer.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Since they are all in the same
shell, r is remaining the same.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
And so, the overall effect is
that the radius of the atoms

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
decreases.
As you go down the Periodic

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Table, the ionization energy and
the electron affinity decrease.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
They decrease because it is the
r dependence,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
here, that takes over.
Z is, of course,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
increasing, but not as fast as
r.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.000
As you go down the Periodic
Table, you are going to shells

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
that, on the average,
are further out from the

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
nucleus.
And that dependence takes over,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.000
causing EA and IE to decrease.
And then the radius,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
of course, increases,
because, as you go down,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:41.000
you are putting the electrons
into shells which are on the

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
average farther away from the
nucleus.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
That is just a review of those
trends.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Then, finally,
I want to just define another

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.000
term, and that is the
electronegativity.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Sometimes we give that the
symbol chi.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
The electronegativity is an
empirical quantity.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
We are going to use Mulliken's
definition for the

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
electronegativity.
There is a Pauling definition.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Mulliken is a little bit more
straightforward.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
And that electronegativity is
defined as one-half times the

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000
quantity ionization energy plus
the electron affinity.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000
The electronegativity is

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:37.000
proportional to the average of
the ionization energy and the

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000
electron affinity.
The electronegativity is a

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:48.000
measure of the tendency of an
atom to accept or to donate an

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
electron.
If you look at the Periodic

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Table, here, you have atoms in
the upper right-hand corner of

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000
the Periodic Table.
Well, they have high

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000
electronegativities.
They are good electron

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
acceptors.
They have high

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:15.000
electronegativities because they
have high electron affinities.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000
Adding an electron to them
means that there is a larger

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:26.000
amount of energy release.
The anion is much more stable

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000
than the neutral.
And the electron affinity is

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000
minus that energy change,
remember from last time.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
These atoms here,
with their high electron

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
affinities, are good electron
acceptors.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000
They are also good electron
acceptors because their

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000
ionization energies are also
high, which means you have to

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
put in a lot of energy to pull
an electron off.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000
They don't like to donate
electrons, rather they are good

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:00.000
electron acceptors.
And then, the elements that are

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:06.000
in the bottom left-hand corner
of the Periodic Table have low

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.000
electronegativities.
They are good electron donors

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:17.000
because their ionization energy
is low in this part of the

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.000
periodic table.
You don't have to put in so

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000
much energy to pull an electron
off.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.000
They are also good electron
donors because their electron

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:37.000
affinity is low.
You don't get as much energy

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
back when you put an electron on
them.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000
These are good electron donors.
High chi, here.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
These are good electron
acceptors.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.000
And one thing you already know
probably is that some of the

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.000
strongest ionic bonds are made
between elements in these two

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.000
corners of the periodic table.
An ionic bond,

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.000
as we are going to talk about,
is one in which the electrons

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.000
are not shared equally.
And so these strong ionic bonds

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:17.000
occur between elements with high
electronegativity and low

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000
electronegativity.
So that's that concept.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.000
And then, finally,
one other kind of odd and end

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
here.
That is this term

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.000
isoelectronic.
I have listed here a bunch of

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
atoms and ions that are
isoelectronic.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.000
Isoelectronic means having the
same electron structure.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.000
All of these atoms and ions
have the electron configuration

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
1s 2 2s 2 2p 6.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
For example,
this nitrogen,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000
N minus 3,
it has added three electrons to

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:01.000
be nitrogen minus three.
It has added three electrons to

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:07.000
get this electron configuration,
this rare gas configuration,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:13.000
this octet configuration which
is a very stable configuration.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.000
Aluminum has three electrons
removed to obtain this

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
particular electron
configuration.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.000
The common ions,
ions that you see commonly in

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:30.000
nature, are ions that,
in fact, do have this octet

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000
configuration,
this electron configuration of

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
an inert gas.
For example,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:42.000
you will often see compounds
with nitrogen minus three.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
You won't very often see a

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.000
compound with nitrogen minus two
or nitrogen minus one

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:54.000
because those are not
as stable as nitrogen minus

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
three,
given this rare gas or the

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
octet configuration.
All right.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000
That is just a little odd and
end.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:09.000
I just wanted to make sure that
everybody was on the same level

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:15.000
with the understanding of the
word isoelectronic there.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:20.000
Well, now what I thought I
would do is talk a little bit

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:25.000
about wave functions and the
usefulness of wave functions.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:31.000
This is going to be on the side
boards here.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:36.000
I wanted to just show you in
kind of simple terms how a wave

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:42.000
function actually determines the
intensity of some transition.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:47.000
Many of you have asked me about
the intensities of transitions,

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:53.000
and so I thought I would show
you just a little bit about how

00:08:53.000 --> 00:09:00.000
these wave functions determine
the intensities of transitions.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
First of all,
I have to explain this diagram

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
to you.
This is going to be a diagram

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000
for a hydrogen atom.
That is what we are going to

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000
talk about here.
What we are going to start with

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:19.000
is an energy level diagram for
the hydrogen atoms.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.000
That is what this axis is.
And so, I am plotting in that

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
diagram, energy,
going up.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:31.000
And I plot the energy level for
n equals 1.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:37.000
I plot the energy level for n
equals 2, n equals 3,

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:45.000
all the way up to n equals 235,
which is really very close to

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:50.000
zero.
That is part of what is on this

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:55.000
plot right here,
n equals 1, n equals 2,

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.000
n equals 3.
But then, what is also

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:07.000
typically done on the same plot
is that the potential energy of

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000
interaction is plotted as a
function of r.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:17.000
And so, on this axis here,
kind of superimposed,

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:22.000
is this distance r.
And we plot often the potential

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:27.000
energy of interaction.
The potential energy of

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:33.000
interaction kind of looks like
that.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.000
This potential energy of
interaction is the Coulomb

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:43.000
interaction, minus e squared 4
pi epsilon nought times r.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:48.000
That is what that line is on

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
this plot.
Then what we do is we actually

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:56.000
plot the form of the wave
function, kind of on top of the

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:01.000
energy levels.
What we do is to say,

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
for example,
take the n equals 1 wave

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:10.000
function, which starts at r
equals 0 at some finite value

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.000
and it is just an exponential
decay.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:19.000
And we plot it on this diagram,
but we use the n equals 1

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.000
energy here as the value of Psi
equals 0.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:28.000
In other words,
the n equals 1 wave function

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:34.000
looks kind of like that.
This level here is Psi equals

00:00:00.000 --> 00:11:36.000
This is the value of Psi,

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
whatever it is,
at r equals 0,

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
and there is just an
exponential decay.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:46.000
We plot the wave function on
top of that energy level.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
In other words,
this is a complex diagram here.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.000
You are going to see,
if you take any course beyond

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:58.000
this, this diagram a lot,
with energy levels and wave

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.000
functions plotted on top of
them.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:07.000
And then, the n equals 2 wave
function is plotted on top of

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.000
the n equals 2 energy level.
Again, at r equals 0,

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
it is some finite value and
then it drops.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:19.000
At some value of r,
we have a node for n equals 2

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
here.
The n equals 2 is the Psi

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.000
equals 0.
Right here, you have a radial

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
node.
Then it goes up and then it

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:32.000
comes back.
It goes down to a negative

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:37.000
value and then comes back up.
That is n equals 2.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:42.000
And so forth and so on.
n equals 3 looks like this.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:47.000
It has two radial nodes.
That is what that diagram is

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:51.000
showing here.
And then we get to n equals

00:03:55.000 --> 00:12:54.000
Here is the wave function.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:59.000
Is this is a hydrogen atom and
you have n equals 235,

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:04.000
how many radial nodes do you
have?

00:03:54.000 --> 00:13:06.000
This wave function is passing

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:11.000
through this origin 234 times.
That is the wave function.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:16.000
And then it tails off.
There is always an exponential

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.000
dependence there.
That is what that wave function

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
looks like.
Now, how do these relate to the

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:28.000
intensity of some transition?
Well, the intensity of a

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.000
transition is related to the
overlap between the wave

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:37.000
function of the initial state
and the wave function of the

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:42.000
final state.
What do I mean by overlap?

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.000
Well, by overlap,
I mean you take the wave

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000
function, here,
of the initial state,

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:54.000
so I am going to pretend we
have a hydrogen atom in the

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
state, this is its wave
function.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:03.000
And that hydrogen atom is going
to be relaxing to the n equals 1

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
state.
What I am going to do,

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
to get the overlap,
is I'm going to take the

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:14.000
product of the wave function of
the initial state times that of

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000
the final state,
and essentially I am going to

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
integrate that resulting
function.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:23.000
I am going to multiply these
two wave functions together,

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.000
and I am going to integrate
over all r the resulting

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:31.000
function.
That is what I mean by overlap.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
But there is another term here.
There is an r,

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
too.
That r is important.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000
It has to do with the
transition moment dipole.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000
And we won't go into that,
but it is there.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
But it won't affect the
argument I am going to make for

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000
you right now.
We take the wave function of

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000
the initial state,
multiply it by the final state

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:54.000
times r, and then we integrate
this whole thing from r equals 0

00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:00.000
to infinity and then square it.
That quantity is proportional

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
to the intensity of some
transition.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:07.000
Let's do that.
Here is Psi n equals 235,

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:11.000
we are multiplying it by Psi of

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:16.000
n equals 0 and
actually multiplying it by r.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:22.000
And what we are going to see,
if we just look at this product

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:28.000
here, if we just looked at Psi n
equals 235 and

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:33.000
Psi n equals 1,
if we just looked at that

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:39.000
product, we are going to
multiply this times that.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000
In a graphical form,
it is going to look like this.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
It is going to go up,
down, up, down,

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000
up, down.
It is going to oscillate and

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:51.000
then tail off in an exponential
way because we are multiply this

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
up, down, up,
down, up down times this

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000
exponential decay.
It is going to look something

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.000
like that.
But now, we are going to

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.000
integrate this resulting curve.
What you can see is that the

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:09.000
area above this curve is equal
to the area below this curve,

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000
approximately.
And, when we integrate

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:17.000
something, we are calculating
the area underneath the curve.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:23.000
These positive areas are going
to cancel these negative areas.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.000
The result is that this
integral is going to be very

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.000
small.
And the result is that the

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000
intensity of that line is very
low.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.000
The intensities are
proportional to this overlap,

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:42.000
the overlap of the initial
state wave function and the

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.000
final state wave function.
And you can see,

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000
here, graphically,
how if you integrate that

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:53.000
product in this case,
the positive areas cancel the

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:57.000
negative areas,
and you don't have a very

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:02.000
intense transition.
However, suppose we look at the

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.000
transition from n equals 3 to n
equals 2.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.000
Well, here is the n equals 3
wave function,

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.000
here is the n equals 2 wave
function.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:19.000
And our intensity expression
says that we have to multiply

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000
these two.
Let's do that.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.000
Let's multiply n equals 3 times
n equals 2, here.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:30.000
Well, the result,
if you excuse my not so great

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:37.000
drawing, is we start out with a
very positive function here.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:42.000
But then we have two negatives
here, which make it a little bit

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.000
less negative.
But then, we have a positive,

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:50.000
here, times a negative,
and what that makes is a large

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:54.000
area that is negative.
And, if we go and integrate

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:59.000
that, now we don't have the same
cancellation of positive and

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:03.000
negative areas.
We integrate that,

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000
and that transition energy is
large.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:10.000
Or, that area is large,
therefore the intensity of that

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000
transition is large.
Bottom line,

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:17.000
that is one of the elements
that dictates the intensity of a

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.000
transition.
It is also one of the elements

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.000
that dictates the intensity of
your photoelectron spectra.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:29.000
Somebody asked me about it the
other day.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.000
I had drawn lines in the
photoelectronic spectra that

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:36.000
were of the same intensity,
1s, 2s, 2p 6.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:40.000
Somebody said,
well, you have more electrons

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.000
in the 2p state.
Why don't you have a larger

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000
number of electrons coming off?
The answer is,

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:51.000
that is part of what goes into
determining the intensity of the

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000
transition, but there is more to
it.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.000
It is not just the number of
electrons.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:01.000
Here is one of the elements
that goes into determining the

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:07.000
intensity of some transition.
It is the wave functions and

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:13.000
the overlap between the final
and the initial state.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.000
And then, I just wanted to also
show you, here,

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:23.000
for this atom in the n equals
235 state, I plotted just for

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:29.000
fun, kind of schematically,
what the radial probability

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:35.000
distribution would look like.
That is just r squared times

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.000
the radial part squared.
And, of course,

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.000
since the wave function goes
like this, oscillates,

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:45.000
that is what the radial
probability distribution is

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.000
going to do.
And you are going to see

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.000
nodes here, 234 values of r,
that is going to make the wave

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.000
function be equal to zero.
And then way out here,

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:00.000
you are going to have a
feature.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.000
That last feature,
here, is going to have the

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:09.000
maximum probability,
and that is your value of r

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:15.000
that is most probable.
It turns out for n equals

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:21.000
that the most probable value of
r is 43,800 angstroms.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.000
That is about 4.38x10^-6
meters.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:31.000
This is a really large hydrogen
atom, n equals 235.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.000
Do they exist?
The answer is yes,

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:37.000
they do exist.
They exist, particularly in

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:41.000
outer space, where there is lots
of UV radiation to get these

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:45.000
hydrogen atoms up into these
very excited states.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:50.000
And they exist in deep outer
space, where the temperatures

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.000
are pretty cold.
And you need those cold

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:58.000
temperatures because this
hydrogen atom is not very stable

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:06.000
in n equals 235.
And, if you went and calculated

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:12.000
here, I am going to draw a line,
here.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:21.000
This is going to be n equals
235, and this is the zero of

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:27.000
energy.
This energy difference here is

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:34.000
about 4x10^-23 joules.
Whereas, at room temperature,

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:38.000
we will just talk about the
thermal energy,

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.000
thermal energy is about
4x10^-21 joules.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:46.000
You can see that any little
fluctuation at room temperature,

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:52.000
since this is two orders of
magnitude larger than what this

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:57.000
bound by, any little fluctuation
would kick this very weakly

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:02.000
bound electron up and ionize it.
And it would.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:07.000
You really only see these in
environments that are very cold,

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:12.000
where you don't perturb what
are called Rydberg atoms

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:16.000
sometimes.
I think in the laboratory the

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:22.000
largest Rydberg atom that has
been made is n equals 180 or n

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:26.000
equals 200 or so.
Anyway, that was really just

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:32.000
for fun that I wanted to tell
you about that.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:38.000
Now, there is another little
tidbit that I want to talk to

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:44.000
you about that has to do with
how knowing something about the

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:51.000
energy levels in an atom leads
to a nice practical device,

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:57.000
like a helium neon laser.
We have to take a look at the

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:02.000
neon energy levels.
And so we have another

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:07.000
discharge lamp here,
and we have some more of these

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:12.000
glasses, here,
so that you can resolve the

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:16.000
neon lines here.
The TAs will get them out.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:21.000
Here is our neon discharge
lamp.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:30.000
You can resolve,
here, the neon spectrum.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:34.000
The spectrum that you should
see should be what is shown on

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:38.000
the side walls here.
Let me turn off the lights so

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:43.000
that you can see it a little bit
better, hopefully.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:57.000
You can see lots of lines in
the case of neon because we have

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:00.000
lots of different occupied
states.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:05.000
The glasses that I have
actually are doing a phenomenal

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:10.000
job in resolving those very
closely spaced lines.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:15.000
I must have a better quality
glass today.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:40.000
And, if you look at the side
walls, you can see that I drew

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:44.000
one of those lines.
One of those emission lines is

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:48.000
at 632 nanometers,
which is the emission line of a

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:52.000
helium neon laser.
But it is really a neon

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:56.000
transition that we will talk
about in a moment.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:01.000
I drew it as very thick on the
board.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:05.000
Because when I looked at the
discharge lamp and drew that

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:10.000
picture, my glasses did not
resolve those lines so very

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:13.000
well.
And so that one looked really

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:16.000
thick to me.
At least my glasses,

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.000
I can really see lots and lots
of discrete lines.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:23.000
But it is this transition,
632 nanometers,

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:27.000
that is the output of the
helium neon laser,

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:32.000
which is the red laser that I
use sometimes in the lecture,

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:37.000
here, to point.
It is the basis of the laser

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:43.000
that is used in the grocery
stores to scan the prices on

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:46.000
your items.
And it turns out that what is

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:50.000
going on, here,
is the following.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:55.000
If you look on the side walls,
we have neon in the ground

00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:00.000
state before we turn the
discharge on.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:04.000
And then, when we turn the
discharge on,

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:11.000
that pumps energy into the neon
atoms such that one of those

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:17.000
electrons, the 2p electron,
gets promoted into the 5s

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:20.000
state.
And then, of course,

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:26.000
that atom wants to relax.
And so here it comes again.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:33.000
That 5s state relaxes.
That electron relaxes to the 3p

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.000
state.
And it is actually that

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:41.000
transition that occurs at 632.8
nanometers, the basis of the

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:45.000
helium neon laser.
It is that transition,

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:50.000
from the 5s to the 3p.
It is not all the way down,

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.000
but ultimately,
of course, that state relaxes.

00:26:54.000 --> 00:27:00.000
But what is going on in the
helium neon laser?

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:05.000
Well, in the helium neon laser,
we have a discharge ignited

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:10.000
where we have a lot of neon
atoms here in this excited

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:16.000
state, with the one electron in
the 5s state right as I show

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.000
you.
And that is emitting,

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:24.000
a photon comes out.
But what is happening here is

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:30.000
that the photon that is emitted
is able to, because of the

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:36.000
construction of this laser,
contact or to interact with

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:41.000
another neon atom in this same
excited state,

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:48.000
that 2p 5 5s state.
That photon interacts with this

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:53.000
excited atom.
When it interacts with that

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:58.000
excited atom,
what happens is that the photon

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:04.000
stimulates that excited atom to
actually emit a photon of the

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:10.000
same energy.
This photon stimulates this

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:14.000
excited atom to release its
energy right at that time.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:18.000
The result is that you have two
photons coming out.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:23.000
They are going to come out in
the same direction and they are

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.000
going to be what is called
coherent.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:31.000
That is, their phases are going
to match.

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:36.000
If you think now of the photon
as a wave, they are going to be

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:39.000
coherent.
And the result is that you are

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:44.000
going to have some radiation
that is going to be twice as

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:47.000
intense because they are
coherent.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:51.000
They are in phase.
And then, what happens is that

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:55.000
these two photons,
they each then interact with

00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:01.000
another neon atom in this same
excited state.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:06.000
And each of those photons
stimulates another atom to emit

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:09.000
photons.
And the result is now that you

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:14.000
have four photons being emitted,
the same frequency,

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:17.000
same direction,
and same phase.

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:22.000
And it is in this way that we
amplify the light in any kind of

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:25.000
laser.
This is what is going on,

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:30.000
this process of simulated
emission.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:34.000
Where you have a photon that
now is exactly the frequency of

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:40.000
the energy difference of the
transition that you are going to

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:44.000
make in this excited atom.
This stimulates that atom to

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:48.000
emit a photon.
The two photons then come off

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:51.000
coherently.
And then, these two interact

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:55.000
with two other atoms.
Now you have four photons that

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:58.000
are coming off.
That is the process of

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:03.000
amplification in any type of
laser.

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:13.000
Of course, in order to make
this work, you have to have a

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:19.000
lot of these excited neon atoms
around because you have to be

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:25.000
able to have a photon interact
with them before they just emit

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:30.000
spontaneously.
This is stimulated emission.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:34.000
The other kind of emission that
we were talking about is

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.000
spontaneous emission.
In other words,

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:40.000
you have to have a high
concentration of these excited

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:44.000
neon atoms so that the photons
that are originally emitted

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:48.000
here, by just spontaneous
emission, can interact with

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:52.000
those excited state neon atoms
and stimulate the emission and

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:57.000
get this whole process rolling.
In order to produce a whole lot

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:01.000
of those excited neon atoms,
what happens is we add in a

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:06.000
little bit of helium.
It turns out that in helium

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:10.000
there are some excited states
that are just,

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:13.000
by accident,
at the same energy as this

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:17.000
excited state of neon.
And the helium actually

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:21.000
transfers its energy to the
neon, into this state,

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:25.000
and maintains,
then, that very high population

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:30.000
of neon atoms here in this
excited state.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.000
That is the function of the
helium.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:37.000
It is just the energy transfer
from the helium excited state to

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:42.000
the neon excited state.
It keeps the population of the

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:46.000
neon atoms really high.
The helium, you don't see that

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:49.000
emission.
That is just a helper in this

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:53.000
device.
It is the neon transition that

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:59.000
you are looking at here.
That was just a short story

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:06.000
about the usefulness of knowing
about the energy levels in atoms

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:14.000
and how ultimately you can make
a practical device because you

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:20.000
know something about the energy
levels of your atoms.

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:25.000
Well, that is going to finish
up, right now,

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:32.000
our discussion of atoms.
And now, it is time to move

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:36.000
onto one of the very important
parts of chemistry,

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:42.000
and that is chemical bonds and
the combination of atoms to form

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:46.000
a chemical bond.
That is what we are going to

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.000
start talking about,
now.

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:53.000
Today, what we are going to do
is just talk about the

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:58.000
fundamental interactions that
are present in every chemical

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:02.000
bond.
Let's start with that.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:07.000
Let me come over here while the
lights are warming up so you can

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:12.000
see that board.
Suppose we have a hydrogen atom

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.000
here, nucleus a,
plus charge.

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:19.000
And it, of course,
has electron a attached to it.

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:23.000
And way out here,
we have nucleus b and electron

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:30.000
b that is attached to it.
And they are very far apart.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:34.000
And so, in this case,
where they are very far apart,

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:39.000
the energy of interaction is
just the energy of interaction

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:44.000
between the electron and the
nucleus, the electron-nuclear

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.000
attraction.
Here it is, the

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:52.000
electron-nuclear attraction.
However, as we bring these two

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:56.000
hydrogen atoms together,
at some point this electron

00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:01.000
that was only attracted to
nucleus a is now begins to

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:06.000
experience an attraction with
nucleus b.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:10.000
And this electron that was
attracted only to nucleus b

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:14.000
experiences an interaction
whereby it is now attracted to

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:17.000
nucleus a.
And that kind of mutual

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:22.000
attractive interaction then
brings those two nuclei closer

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:25.000
together.
However, at the same time,

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:29.000
when you bring those two nuclei
closer together,

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:34.000
you are bringing the electrons
closer together.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:38.000
And so there is an
electron-electron repulsion that

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.000
is present.
In addition,

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:45.000
as you bring these two nuclei
together, what is happening here

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:49.000
is you are having a
nuclear-nuclear repulsion.

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:54.000
A chemical bond is really the
sum of these three interactions

00:34:54.000 --> 00:35:00.000
and the interplay between these
three interactions.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:05.000
That is what we want to try to
look at and try to understand.

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:10.000
How are we going to do that?
Well, the first thing I am

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:15.000
going to do is I am going to
draw an energy of interaction as

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:21.000
a function of the distance
between the two hydrogen atoms.

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:26.000
I am going to take two hydrogen
atoms and I am going to call the

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:32.000
distance between them r.
Now, I have changed my

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:36.000
definition of r.
r is the distance between the

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:39.000
two nuclei.
It is no longer the distance

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:43.000
between the nucleus and the
electron.

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:46.000
I have just changed my
definition of r.

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:51.000
And I am going to plot the
energy of interaction as a

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:55.000
function of that distance
between the two nuclei.

00:35:55.000 --> 00:36:00.000
Here is my energy of
interaction.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:04.000
There is going to be a zero of
energy, here.

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:08.000
I am going to plot this as a
function of r,

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:12.000
and the plot is going to look
like this.

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:15.000
Way out here,
where r is large,

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:19.000
I have two separated hydrogen
atoms.

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:24.000
The energy, here,
is minus 2,624 kilojoules per

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:27.000
mole.
That is what this energy of

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:31.000
interaction is,
here.

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:35.000
Now, as I bring these two
hydrogen atoms together,

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:40.000
what happens is that this
energy is going to decrease.

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:44.000
And it is going to keep
decreasing until we get to some

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:47.000
point.
And then, as r gets even

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:51.000
smaller, that energy of
interaction is going to

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:56.000
skyrocket and go to infinity.
Starting about here somewhere,

00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:02.000
where the energy of interaction
is less, is more negative than

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:08.000
the separated hydrogen atoms.
Well, what that means is that

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:12.000
we are forming a chemical bond.
The two hydrogen atoms are more

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:15.000
stable then when they are
separated.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:19.000
The two hydrogen atoms are
bound as soon as this energy of

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:24.000
interaction gets more negative
than the separated atom limit.

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:26.000
And it keeps getting more
negative.

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:29.000
And, of course,
the value of r at which that

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:33.000
energy of interaction is a
maximum negative number,

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:38.000
well, that is the equilibrium
bond length.

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:45.000
This is the most stable value
of r at which the energy is the

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:49.000
lowest.
It is the most stable

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:54.000
configuration.
In the case of hydrogen,

00:37:54.000 --> 00:38:00.000
that value of r is 0.74
angstroms.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:05.000
In this potential energy curve,
as it is often called,

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:11.000
everywhere where this energy of
interaction is lower than the

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:15.000
separated hydrogen atom limit,
everywhere here,

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:21.000
this is called the attractive
region of the interaction

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:24.000
potential.
It is attractive because the

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:32.000
hydrogen atoms bound are more
stable than they are separated.

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:34.000
Or, the hydrogen atoms are
bound.

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:40.000
They are more stable than the
two hydrogen atoms separated.

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:45.000
We call this the attractive
region of the potential energy

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:47.000
curve.
We also call this region,

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:51.000
this attractive region,
we call that the well.

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:56.000
And the well depth,
here, from the bottom to the

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:01.000
separated hydrogen atom limit,
if you measure the energy from

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:04.000
the bottom up,
that energy is the bond

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:10.000
association energy.
We are going to call it delta E

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:14.000
sub d,
from the bottom here to the

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:18.000
separated hydrogen atom limit.
That is the bond energy.

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:23.000
432 kilojoules per mole is the
energy that you have to put into

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:28.000
the H two molecule to
separate it.

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:32.000
You have to get it from the
bottom of this well to the

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:35.000
separated hydrogen atom limit
here.

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:39.000
Now, you can also see,
here, as you push those two

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:43.000
hydrogen atoms even closer
together than the equilibrium

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:48.000
bond length, you can see that
the energy is going back up.

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:52.000
And at some point,
if you push the two hydrogen

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:57.000
atoms close enough together such
that the energy is equal to that

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:02.000
of the separated hydrogen atom,
it then becomes greater than

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:07.000
that of the separated hydrogen
atom.

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:10.000
From this value of r on,
the hydrogen atoms are no

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:14.000
longer bound because their
energy is greater than the

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:18.000
separated hydrogen atom limit.
We call this part of the

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:22.000
potential energy of interaction
the repulsive part.

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:26.000
In other words,
as you push the two hydrogen

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:30.000
atoms closer together,
they form a bond.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:36.000
But if you push them too close,
they are going to fly apart.

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:42.000
They are no longer bound.
This is the general potential

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:46.000
energy of interaction for every
chemical bond.

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:51.000
Every single bond has this
general shape.

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:55.000
That is important.
But that shape is really a

00:40:55.000 --> 00:41:01.000
consequence of these three
interactions that I talked about

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:07.000
when we started this problem,
here.

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:11.000
And so, what I want to try to
do is now try to dissect that

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:17.000
curve into the three components
that give rise to that potential

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:21.000
energy of interaction,
that dependence as a function

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:25.000
of r.
I want to pull that apart.

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:36.000
This energy of interaction is
the sum of the nuclear

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:41.000
repulsion.
Pushing the nuclei too close

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:47.000
together, there is a repulsive
interaction.

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:51.000
That is one of the
interactions.

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:58.000
Plus, the electron-nuclear
attraction is the attraction

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:07.000
between the electron and the
nucleus on which it came in.

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:11.000
And also between the electron
and the other nucleus.

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:14.000
That is the electron-nuclear
attraction.

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:17.000
Plus the electron-electron
repulsive.

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:21.000
Well, when you bring two
hydrogen atoms together those

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:25.000
electrons are going to repel.
That is the energy of

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:28.000
interaction.
It is the sum of those three

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:34.000
fundamental interactions.
But what I want to do is figure

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:39.000
out an r dependence for each one
of these interactions.

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:44.000
And the sum of that r
dependence should give me a

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:48.000
shape that looks like this.
I want to see which

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:53.000
interactions are important at
what values of r.

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:56.000
Let me start.
Let's start with the

00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:01.000
nuclear-nuclear repulsion here.
If I wanted an r dependence for

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:04.000
what that nuclear-nuclear
repulsion looked like,

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:06.000
what would that be?

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:14.000
Coulomb force.
It is the repulsive Coulomb

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:18.000
interaction.
It is e squared over 4 pi

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:22.000
epsilon nought r.

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:27.000
This is just two like charges
that are repelling.

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:32.000
And so now let me draw that
repulsive interaction as a

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:37.000
function of r on an energy level
diagram.

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:40.000
Here is my energy of
interaction.

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:44.000
It is a function of r.
There is going to be a zero

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:48.000
here.
And this repulsive interaction

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:51.000
is going to be positive
everywhere.

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:56.000
It is going to be infinite here
and a one over r

00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:01.000
dependence coming down.
This is the Coulomb

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:05.000
interaction.
This is the nuclear-nuclear

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:09.000
repulsion.
That is what it looks like as a

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:12.000
function of r.
That is one component.

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:16.000
Now, what about the other
components here?

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:21.000
Well, it turns out I have no
simple way of estimating what

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:28.000
the r dependence is for the
electron-nuclear attraction.

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:32.000
I have no simple way of
estimating what the r dependence

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:35.000
is for the electron-electron
repulsion.

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:39.000
And I have no simple way of
doing that for the sum of those

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:42.000
two terms.
Actually, the sum of these two

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:46.000
terms, I am going to call the
electron interactions.

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:50.000
Each one of these terms
involves the electrons.

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:54.000
The is the electron-electron
repulsion, electron-nuclear

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:57.000
attraction.
This term does not have any

00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:03.000
electrons in it.
I have no simple way of telling

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:09.000
you or estimating what the r
dependence is of the sum of

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:13.000
these two terms.
However, what I can do is

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:18.000
figure out what the energy is
for the sum of those two

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:25.000
interactions at two extremes.
I can tell you what the energy

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:30.000
is at r equal infinity,
and then I can tell you what it

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:35.000
is at r equal zero.
And, therefore,

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:38.000
on this plot,
I am going to come in with a

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:43.000
value for r equal infinity and a
value for r equal zero.

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:48.000
I am going to draw a straight
line as an estimate for the r

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:51.000
dependence.
Then I am going to add them up

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:56.000
and see if the result looks,
in fact, like this energy of

00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:02.000
interaction that I drew for you.
And so that is what I am going

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:06.000
to have to do on Friday.
I will see you on Wednesday,

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:09.000
if not sooner.

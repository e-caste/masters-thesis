WEBVTT

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.940
ADAM MARTIN: So I
guess I will start by,

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:21.540
first of all,
congratulating you all.

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:23.640
Since the last
time I've seen you,

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.060
you've all regenerated
your intestine.

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.170
So it's like you're
a brand new person.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.610
So there's that.

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.910
I want to start the lecture
by talking about something

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.040
I've been putting off
telling you about,

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.090
which is the Nobel Prize
in physiology or medicine

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.460
that was awarded this year.

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.830
And it was awarded to James
Allison and Tasuku Honjo

00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:01.140
for their discovery of a way
to harness the immune system

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.720
to fight cancer.

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.900
And we're going to talk
about the immune system

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.120
later in the course,
and it turns out,

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:13.230
I will lecture on it.

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:15.480
And I've actually
had immunology,

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:19.140
and in fact, I had immunology
with James Allison.

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.260
So I will do my best to
channel James Allison when

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.390
I talk about the immune system.

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.850
But what they won
the prize for is,

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.520
they figured out a way
to essentially release

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.280
the brake on the
immune system in order

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.870
to allow the immune system
to better fight cancer.

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:40.110
And this is a technique that's
been used in the clinic,

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.800
and there are currently a
number of clinical trials

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.860
that are also looking
to see whether this

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.100
can be used in a variety
of different cancer types.

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.720
OK.

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.370
So I just wanted to
point that out now

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:55.170
because we're
talking about cancer,

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.940
and I'll go more
into the mechanism

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.220
as how this works
when we start talking

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.830
about the immune system.

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:06.240
So as I mentioned
in the last lecture,

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.240
cancer is basically
a progressive loss

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.730
of tissue organization.

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:18.360
And luckily for us,
our body has a number

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.680
of different barriers to cells
becoming cancerous and forming

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:23.670
a tumor.

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.290
And so I wanted
to start out just

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.490
by having you guys tell me what
you feel the barriers would

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:31.950
be to this process.

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.010
So who has an idea of a barrier?

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.150
What are the barriers
in place by your body

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.080
to prevent cancer cells from
arising and forming a tumor,

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.100
and for this process to
form a malignant tumor?

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:54.450
What's that?

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:55.810
Oh, Rachel, sorry.

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:57.190
STUDENT: Apoptosis.

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.630
ADAM MARTIN: Apoptosis
is a good one, right.

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:06.940
So there's a careful
process in your body

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:12.280
to limit how long certain
cells are resident in the body.

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.340
And all of this depends
on communication

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:20.620
between different cell
types in your body--

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.890
so barriers to tumor agenesis.

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.090
And one type of signal
is a survival signal.

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.850
And if a cell is not
getting a survival signal,

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:36.910
then the cell will
undergo apoptosis,

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:40.090
which is what Rachel
was referring to.

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:44.950
So one barrier is that
there is a highly regulated

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:48.340
system of determining
whether or not cells divide

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.810
and also whether
or not cells live.

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:51.310
OK.

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:59.410
So there are growth
survival signals,

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:03.790
which means that the decision
for a cell to go off its rocker

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:06.520
and just start
dividing uncontrollably

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:10.120
is not likely for a normal cell.

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.500
Something has to happen to that
cell in order to perturb it.

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:19.420
So what are some other
barriers to forming a tumor

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:22.930
and for that tumor
to become invasive?

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:23.670
Yes, Jeremy?

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:27.010
STUDENT: You just mentioned
it, but the immune system.

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.760
ADAM MARTIN: Yeah.

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:33.290
So this cancer cell can't
activate the immune system.

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:38.157
So you could have some
type of immunosuppression

00:04:38.157 --> 00:04:38.740
of the cancer.

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:44.080
And I won't talk
about that today,

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.630
but maybe we'll come back
and talk about it when we

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:49.340
talk about the immune system.

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:49.840
OK.

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:55.210
Looking at this diagram,
when the tumor proceeds

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:57.310
to invasive cancer,
what do you think

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:59.984
are some barriers to
that process happening?

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:10.590
What are cells normally
doing in an organ?

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:13.530
The cells that line
your intestine,

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:16.360
are they invading into
the surrounding tissue?

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:16.860
No.

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:19.140
Jeremy is shaking
his head no, right?

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:24.060
So normally, cells don't do
that, or certain types of cells

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:26.550
do, but normally,
if you have cells

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:28.440
that are the lining
of an epithelium,

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:32.460
they're not going off
to a blood vessel.

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:33.480
OK.

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:40.050
So I'm just going to review
the structure of the tissue,

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:42.990
and then we'll talk about
some of the barriers that

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:45.880
prevent this from happening.

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:50.130
So I'm drawing a
tubular organ here.

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:53.970
This could be the
tube of the intestine.

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:56.280
There'd be a lumen inside here.

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:58.770
It could be some ductal
structure in an organ,

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:00.570
like a mammary gland.

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:03.360
It could be that this
is the airway of a lung,

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:07.260
and there's an epithelial
lining around that airway.

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:13.350
So these cells here are
forming an epithelial lining.

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:17.340
And one important aspect
of epithelial biology

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:22.200
is, immature epithelia,
they have a floor

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:26.550
that the cells stand on.

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:31.470
So this structure that I
just drew around these cells

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:34.020
in green is known as
the basement membrane.

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:41.940
It's the basement because it's
the floor that this other thing

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:43.890
is built on.

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:46.020
And this basement
membrane is made out

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:49.920
of what is known as the
extracellular matrix, which

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:53.010
I'll just call matrix right now,
and the extracellular matrix

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:55.710
are basically
extracellular proteins

00:06:55.710 --> 00:07:01.050
that form a mesh work that
forms a rigid structure on which

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:02.850
epithelial cells can sit on.

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:11.380
OK, now if we think about
what surrounds this organ,

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:19.395
there's also matrix proteins
in the intervening areas.

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:24.455
And this is known as
connective tissue.

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:30.800
And so if we think
about the cells that

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:34.880
are the epithelial cells
here, they are in one state,

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:38.660
and this state is known as
epithelial, as I just said.

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:41.540
So these are epithelial cells.

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:45.440
Epithelial cells
have a few properties

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:47.810
that are really distinguishing.

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:51.200
The first is that they have
high intercellular adhesion.

00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:01.370
And the next is
that, if you consider

00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:04.520
their relative mobility,
they can obviously

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:07.250
move within the epithelium
because we talked

00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:08.930
about the intestine
and how cells

00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:12.440
are moving from the base of
the crypts up to the villus.

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:15.050
But in general, these cells
aren't moving in and out

00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:17.060
of the organ.

00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:21.260
So I would say that they have
a low migratory potential.

00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:32.750
And so these are the
epithelial cells that are here.

00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:38.350
Now there are also cells that
are in this interstitial space,

00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:41.030
and I'll draw-- they often
have this highly elongated

00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:42.770
morphology.

00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:47.570
And these cells are in a
fundamentally different state.

00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:55.220
And this state is known
as mesenchymal or stromal.

00:08:58.010 --> 00:09:02.960
So this area outside the organ
is also known as the stroma.

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:07.490
So they're known as stromal
cells in this location.

00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:11.030
And these cells have
very different properties

00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:17.990
than the epithelial cells in
that they have low adhesion--

00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:20.615
I should say low
cell-to-cell adhesion.

00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:28.580
And in contrast to
these epithelial cells,

00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:32.330
these stromal cells, as you
see in this example up here--

00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:34.290
that's a human neutrophil--

00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:37.400
these stromal cells
are highly migratory.

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:46.520
So that neutrophil is
chasing a bacterium,

00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:49.160
and they'll eventually get
it, but the movie will loop,

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:53.300
and so you'll see it constantly
chasing that bacterium.

00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:56.840
So some examples
of stromal cells

00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:59.940
would be immune cells,
like this human neutrophil.

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:05.690
And you probably know
that immune cells

00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:09.590
have to traverse
different organ systems.

00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:12.710
They have to be rapidly
recruited to sites of infection

00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:14.390
or sites of injury.

00:10:14.390 --> 00:10:18.320
And so this type of
cell is fundamentally

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:21.710
different from the types of
cells that line your organs,

00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:24.200
where you basically need
those cells to stay put.

00:10:27.050 --> 00:10:30.320
When considering cancer, you
have these different types

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:31.850
of cells in your body.

00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:36.515
90% of cancer comes from a
cell of epithelial origin.

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:46.700
So 90% of cancers are
epithelial in origin.

00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:56.180
Some other examples
of stromal cells

00:10:56.180 --> 00:11:00.380
are cells like fibroblasts.

00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:04.250
And fibroblasts are cells
that secrete and remodel

00:11:04.250 --> 00:11:07.160
the matrix that's in
connective tissue.

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:10.100
And they're also important for
wound healing and secreting

00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:13.270
matrix during the
wound-healing process.

00:11:13.270 --> 00:11:15.020
So that's just to give
you a few examples.

00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:21.130
OK.

00:11:21.130 --> 00:11:27.040
So now let's come back to this
example and talk about what

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:33.280
happens to get a cell to
go all the way from being

00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:38.680
a normal epithelial cell to
having this type of behavior,

00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:41.170
where initially you
have growth and a loss

00:11:41.170 --> 00:11:44.650
of the control over growth
and survival signaling,

00:11:44.650 --> 00:11:47.410
and eventually, the
cancer can become

00:11:47.410 --> 00:11:48.760
what's known as malignant?

00:11:52.690 --> 00:11:55.690
So it's a progression, and
initially, you might just

00:11:55.690 --> 00:12:00.040
get increased in-cell division
and abnormal cell shape, which

00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:03.190
is known as dysplasia,
and at that point,

00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:07.150
it's known as something like
an adenoma or something that's

00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:09.910
benign.

00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:14.260
But it's this last
point here, up here,

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:18.730
where the cells breach
this basement membrane.

00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:22.300
When that happens, then the
cancer is known as carcinoma,

00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:23.530
and it's malignant.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:40.630
So malignant cancer is cancer
that has breached the basement

00:12:40.630 --> 00:12:41.130
membrane.

00:12:58.990 --> 00:13:03.780
So I want to take you through
the progression of tumor

00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:05.410
genesis.

00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:09.460
And first, I'm going to
start with the breakdown

00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:11.530
of this growth
survival signaling.

00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:17.440
And I just wanted to
remind you about what

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:22.220
we talked about with the
intestine as our model organ.

00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:25.210
And in the intestine,
remember that this is all

00:13:25.210 --> 00:13:33.500
regulated by signals between
stem cells and niche cells.

00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:36.580
So the niche cells are
sending the stem cells

00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:40.480
signals like Wnts that
control their self renewal,

00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:44.860
and then it's the loss
of this signaling that

00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:48.550
allows these cells to eventually
undergo apoptosis and get

00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:51.610
shed into the lumen
of the intestine.

00:13:51.610 --> 00:13:58.180
So one of the first
steps in cancer

00:13:58.180 --> 00:14:11.641
is this breakdown in
growth survival signaling.

00:14:14.590 --> 00:14:20.170
So this first breakdown is going
to enable the cells to overcome

00:14:20.170 --> 00:14:20.980
this first barrier.

00:14:25.050 --> 00:14:29.250
And so as I just
pointed out, remember,

00:14:29.250 --> 00:14:31.350
it helps to think of
what has to happen

00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:33.960
in a normal tissue or organ.

00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:40.170
Normally, the decision whether
or not a cell divides or dies--

00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:46.860
so cell division
and also death--

00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:50.190
is highly regulated.

00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:52.830
And it's regulated by
communication with other cells.

00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:02.025
So in cancer, this
regulation goes awry.

00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:07.290
And how would this
regulation go awry?

00:15:10.938 --> 00:15:13.062
Yeah, Jeremy?

00:15:13.062 --> 00:15:16.340
STUDENT: Loss of function
in a tumor suppressor

00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:20.019
or an over-activation
of the oncogene.

00:15:20.019 --> 00:15:20.960
ADAM MARTIN: Mm-hmm.

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:24.300
So Jeremy suggested that
there could be mutations,

00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:27.030
like oncogenic mutations
or tumor suppressor

00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:31.960
loss, that lead to abnormal
cell division and death.

00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:34.710
And that is exactly right.

00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:40.890
So you could have
oncogenic mutations,

00:15:40.890 --> 00:15:45.720
and these oncogenic mutations,
they often hyperactivate

00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:50.070
or constitutively activate these
growth-signaling pathways that

00:15:50.070 --> 00:15:53.190
are normally downstream of
growth factors and receptor

00:15:53.190 --> 00:15:55.590
tyrosine kinases.

00:15:55.590 --> 00:15:59.160
And if you
hyperactivate those, you

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:03.420
reduce the dependency of
the cells on these signals.

00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:08.550
So these oncogenic
mutations can reduce

00:16:08.550 --> 00:16:15.070
the dependency of cells on
growth factors and growth

00:16:15.070 --> 00:16:15.570
signals.

00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:23.370
OK.

00:16:23.370 --> 00:16:29.700
But one important point is
that this is not enough.

00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:33.570
And you can think about this
in the case of the intestine

00:16:33.570 --> 00:16:37.800
because if you had an oncogenic
mutation in one of these cells

00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:40.650
here, it might not
be as dependent

00:16:40.650 --> 00:16:43.290
on signals for growth.

00:16:43.290 --> 00:16:45.450
But it doesn't matter
because even though you

00:16:45.450 --> 00:16:47.400
had that mutation,
it's going to die,

00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:50.790
and it's going to shed
out of the tissue.

00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:54.480
And actually what
happens in many cases

00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:58.050
where you activate a
signaling pathway that

00:16:58.050 --> 00:17:01.290
allows the cell to,
in an abnormal way,

00:17:01.290 --> 00:17:03.600
go through the cell
cycle, you actually

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:07.589
induce a failsafe mechanism at
the cell which causes the cell

00:17:07.589 --> 00:17:11.069
to undergo apoptosis.

00:17:11.069 --> 00:17:14.040
So often, you get
this step happening,

00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:16.410
and the cells just
undergo apoptosis

00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:20.010
because you've evolved
to protect your organs

00:17:20.010 --> 00:17:22.619
from this type of mutation.

00:17:22.619 --> 00:17:26.520
So it's the oncogenic
mutation, in collaboration

00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:36.300
with loss of tumor suppression,
and one of the main tumor

00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:41.010
suppressive mechanisms
our body has is apoptosis,

00:17:41.010 --> 00:17:43.230
where if a cell is doing
something abnormal,

00:17:43.230 --> 00:17:44.415
the cells simply dies.

00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:51.150
So loss of the tumor
suppressor could

00:17:51.150 --> 00:17:55.200
be loss of a gene that promotes
apoptosis, and in that case,

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:57.840
if the cell loses
that mechanism,

00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:00.270
the cell will avoid apoptosis.

00:18:08.050 --> 00:18:08.550
OK.

00:18:08.550 --> 00:18:14.190
So this is oncogenic
mutations and the loss

00:18:14.190 --> 00:18:18.300
of tumor suppressors
which subverts

00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:22.170
the normal communication
between cells which is required

00:18:22.170 --> 00:18:24.480
for normal tissue homeostasis.

00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:26.670
OK.

00:18:26.670 --> 00:18:30.780
Now another example of this
growth and survival signaling

00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:35.760
is not one which
involves, necessarily,

00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:40.230
a genetic change, but one that
involves changes in expression.

00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:43.620
And it also involves
interaction between the tumor

00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:47.130
and the surrounding
cells of the body.

00:18:47.130 --> 00:18:49.740
So I'm going to tell you
a little bit about tumor

00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:50.940
microenvironment.

00:18:57.490 --> 00:19:00.630
And this is something
that's important to consider

00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:06.330
in cancer because a tumor in
a body, it's not in isolation.

00:19:06.330 --> 00:19:11.190
It's surrounded by other cells
in your body and other things

00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:16.200
in your body, like
matrix, and so here is

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:19.650
a picture showing you
a tumor, and the tumor

00:19:19.650 --> 00:19:23.130
is stained with this membrane
protein which is shown here

00:19:23.130 --> 00:19:24.360
in the rust color.

00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:26.250
So that's the tumor.

00:19:26.250 --> 00:19:32.520
And what's also stained in this
piece of tissue is the DNA.

00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:34.480
It's stained in blue.

00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:38.520
And so you see the nuclei
of the tumor cells in there.

00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:42.810
But you see all these blue
nuclei surrounding the tumor.

00:19:42.810 --> 00:19:48.270
And these are stromal cells
that are around the tumor.

00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:51.210
And they've actually been
recruited to the tumor

00:19:51.210 --> 00:19:54.730
by the cancer cells.

00:19:54.730 --> 00:19:58.100
So what I mean by
tumor microenvironment

00:19:58.100 --> 00:20:01.320
is just the region
around the tumor.

00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:04.650
And so if you have cancer,
and you have a tumor,

00:20:04.650 --> 00:20:08.220
the tumor cells can
actually secrete signals

00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:12.090
which recruit stromal cells.

00:20:12.090 --> 00:20:18.000
So there can be an
interaction where

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:22.590
the tumor sends recruitment
signals that causes

00:20:22.590 --> 00:20:24.270
stromal cells to come by.

00:20:27.570 --> 00:20:32.550
And what the stromal cells can
do, what they do for the tumor

00:20:32.550 --> 00:20:35.130
and why this is
beneficial for the tumor,

00:20:35.130 --> 00:20:39.510
is that stromal cells can
secrete growth signals

00:20:39.510 --> 00:20:44.880
or survival signals that
promote the growth of the tumor.

00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:51.570
So there can be a reciprocal
interaction here where

00:20:51.570 --> 00:20:57.810
you get an abnormal
conversation between cancer

00:20:57.810 --> 00:21:00.690
cells and the surrounding
stromal cells.

00:21:00.690 --> 00:21:02.580
But again, this is
very similar, if you

00:21:02.580 --> 00:21:06.330
think about it, to the
way a normal organ works.

00:21:06.330 --> 00:21:10.290
You often have these
signals going between cells.

00:21:10.290 --> 00:21:15.510
And that is involved in
normal tissue homeostasis.

00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:17.700
What's happening here,
though, is abnormal

00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:20.250
and that the cancer
cells are constitutively

00:21:20.250 --> 00:21:22.110
recruiting these
stromal cells just

00:21:22.110 --> 00:21:26.940
to get this growth signal
that they're addicted to.

00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:30.570
And because you have
just the presence

00:21:30.570 --> 00:21:34.680
of such a loop suggests
that these cancer cells,

00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:37.305
even if they have
oncogenic mutations

00:21:37.305 --> 00:21:40.290
and have lost tumor
suppressors, they

00:21:40.290 --> 00:21:43.770
are not totally independent
of growth signals.

00:21:43.770 --> 00:21:49.020
They still, to some extent,
rely on growth signals.

00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:53.730
So these oncogenic mutations,
they reduce the dependency

00:21:53.730 --> 00:21:58.530
on growth signals,
but this dependency,

00:21:58.530 --> 00:22:08.850
the dependency on growth
signals, is not eliminated.

00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:23.880
And one experiment that showed
this was an experiment that

00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:29.040
was done back in the 1950s where
patients with a type of skin

00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:33.600
cancer, basal cell
carcinoma, were taken,

00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:35.910
and they had their
tumors excised

00:22:35.910 --> 00:22:37.950
from one part of their body.

00:22:37.950 --> 00:22:41.730
And then the tumor was
grafted back onto them,

00:22:41.730 --> 00:22:45.360
to another part of their body,
distant from the original site

00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:47.010
of the tumor.

00:22:47.010 --> 00:22:50.820
And this grafting
experiment was done either

00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:53.490
with the stromal
cells that surrounded

00:22:53.490 --> 00:22:56.640
the tumor or the stromal
cells surrounding the tumor

00:22:56.640 --> 00:22:58.830
were removed, and
just the tumor cells

00:22:58.830 --> 00:23:01.830
were grafted back onto the body.

00:23:01.830 --> 00:23:02.700
OK.

00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:04.500
Now this experiment
probably would not

00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:09.120
be allowed today, but back in
the '50s, I guess it was legal.

00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:12.240
And so the
experimental result is

00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:15.300
that if you graft the tumor
cells with the surrounding

00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:20.730
stroma, the tumor was able
to establish a second tumor,

00:23:20.730 --> 00:23:25.080
or the tumor cells survived
this grafting procedure,

00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:29.910
whereas tumor cells that
were taken without the stroma

00:23:29.910 --> 00:23:34.140
underwent cell death when they
were put in a new location.

00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:38.550
So there's something about this
specialized microenvironment

00:23:38.550 --> 00:23:42.090
that the tumor creates for
itself that is enabling

00:23:42.090 --> 00:23:45.450
the tumor to grow and survive.

00:23:45.450 --> 00:23:49.440
And the model is that it's
because these stromal cells are

00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:52.980
secreting growth factors that
these cancer cells are still

00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:53.940
dependent on.

00:23:58.710 --> 00:24:02.700
So this dependency on
growth signals is important,

00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:08.100
clinically, because
some types of cancer,

00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:11.160
there is an elevation of
growth factor receptors

00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:13.650
that are associated
with the cancer.

00:24:13.650 --> 00:24:20.130
And the famous example of that
is, in 30% of breast cancers,

00:24:20.130 --> 00:24:23.980
there is a growth factor
receptor, the HER2 receptor,

00:24:23.980 --> 00:24:28.980
which is over expressed
in the cancer cells.

00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:33.750
So I just drew a receptor
here, and I'm now talking

00:24:33.750 --> 00:24:35.700
about the HER2 receptor.

00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:43.890
HER2 stands for human epidermal
growth factor, EGF, receptor 2.

00:24:47.550 --> 00:24:52.050
So this is a receptor
tyrosine kinase,

00:24:52.050 --> 00:24:54.900
which is a transmembrane
protein receptor.

00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:57.930
It's expressed on the
surface of the cell.

00:24:57.930 --> 00:25:04.800
And so about 30% of
human breast cancers

00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:16.860
are HER2 positive, which means
that the cancer cells are over

00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:20.940
expressing this receptor
tyrosine kinase.

00:25:20.940 --> 00:25:25.350
The fact that you have these
cancer cells over expressing

00:25:25.350 --> 00:25:28.230
a growth factor
receptor suggests

00:25:28.230 --> 00:25:32.550
that the cancer
requires some type

00:25:32.550 --> 00:25:39.660
of growth stimulus in order
for the cancer to be growing.

00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:43.890
And the fact that
this was discovered,

00:25:43.890 --> 00:25:48.270
that 30% of breast
cancers over express HER2,

00:25:48.270 --> 00:25:51.510
has been used by
researchers to develop

00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:56.100
a treatment for this type of
cancer, this HER2 positive.

00:25:56.100 --> 00:26:01.170
The treatment is
known as Herceptin.

00:26:01.170 --> 00:26:04.110
Possibly some of you
have heard of this.

00:26:04.110 --> 00:26:07.150
It was developed at Genentech.

00:26:07.150 --> 00:26:12.180
And what Herceptin
is, it's an antibody

00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:16.980
that was raised against
a human HER2 protein.

00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:17.790
OK.

00:26:17.790 --> 00:26:20.430
So Herceptin is an antibody.

00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:29.080
It recognizes HER2 on the
surface of these cancer cells,

00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:33.150
and you can treat patients
with this antibody,

00:26:33.150 --> 00:26:37.080
and an antibody binds to
the HER2 positive cells.

00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:40.200
And it either blocks
the function of HER2

00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:44.070
or recruits immune cells
to kill those cells off.

00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:48.010
The exact mechanism, I
don't believe, is known.

00:26:48.010 --> 00:26:50.310
But what is known is
that Herceptin has really

00:26:50.310 --> 00:26:56.290
changed how we're able to treat
HER2 positive breast cancers.

00:26:56.290 --> 00:26:59.490
And it's been a
huge success story

00:26:59.490 --> 00:27:00.915
in the fight against cancer.

00:27:09.260 --> 00:27:09.780
All right.

00:27:09.780 --> 00:27:18.040
So we've talked about this first
barrier, the barrier to tumor

00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:21.310
cells becoming at
least semi-independent

00:27:21.310 --> 00:27:25.060
of these growth factors.

00:27:25.060 --> 00:27:27.880
And so now I want to
talk about other barriers

00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:29.960
to tumor genesis.

00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:33.190
And if you consider an
epithelial cell here,

00:27:33.190 --> 00:27:35.620
even if these cells
are able to grow,

00:27:35.620 --> 00:27:38.500
they won't be able
to leave the organ

00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:40.930
until something else happens.

00:27:40.930 --> 00:27:43.570
And one thing that would need
to happen for these cells

00:27:43.570 --> 00:27:47.650
to become malignant and to
leave the organ that they were

00:27:47.650 --> 00:27:52.570
initially part of is for
there to be a breakdown

00:27:52.570 --> 00:27:55.540
in the adhesion between cells.

00:27:55.540 --> 00:27:59.260
So for the next
few minutes, I want

00:27:59.260 --> 00:28:03.850
to talk about the breakdown
in cell-to-cell adhesion.

00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:17.080
So how would a
cancer cell basically

00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:19.510
unstick itself
from the cells that

00:28:19.510 --> 00:28:25.150
surround it in order to leave
an organ and go somewhere else?

00:28:27.670 --> 00:28:30.520
And for that, to explain
that, I have to remind you

00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:35.210
about some of the normal biology
of these epithelial cells,

00:28:35.210 --> 00:28:37.180
which we talked
about earlier, which

00:28:37.180 --> 00:28:41.200
is that they express these
transmembrane proteins

00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:43.570
that are adhesion proteins.

00:28:43.570 --> 00:28:47.230
So normally, epithelial
cells have adhesion proteins.

00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:52.690
And the famous
one for epithelia,

00:28:52.690 --> 00:28:55.750
or one of the famous
ones, is called

00:28:55.750 --> 00:28:58.490
epithelial or E-cadherin.

00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:07.000
And E-cadherin is a
transmembrane protein.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:10.420
It has an extracellular
domain, but rather

00:29:10.420 --> 00:29:13.210
than that extracellular
domain binding

00:29:13.210 --> 00:29:17.220
to some secreted ligand,
this extracellular domain

00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:21.190
recognizes E-cadherin
molecules on other cells,

00:29:21.190 --> 00:29:22.750
and they stick to each other.

00:29:22.750 --> 00:29:26.230
And it essentially functions
like cellular Velcro.

00:29:26.230 --> 00:29:30.340
So the cells link together, and
they stick to each other such

00:29:30.340 --> 00:29:31.885
that they form a
coherent tissue.

00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:43.150
So the way that cancer
cells subvert this mechanism

00:29:43.150 --> 00:29:46.480
of adhesion is, they
have to do something

00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:49.810
that inhibits E-cadherin.

00:29:49.810 --> 00:29:54.730
And so cancer cells,
what they can do

00:29:54.730 --> 00:29:59.380
is to decrease the
cell-to-cell adhesion,

00:29:59.380 --> 00:30:01.270
and I'll tell you
how in just a minute.

00:30:04.750 --> 00:30:08.290
And in addition to decreasing
this cell-to-cell adhesion,

00:30:08.290 --> 00:30:15.220
they can also promote the genes
that are involved in motility.

00:30:23.850 --> 00:30:27.510
So we have to
understand, then, how

00:30:27.510 --> 00:30:31.620
it is a cancer cell would
do both of these things.

00:30:31.620 --> 00:30:35.220
And I'll start with
cell-to-cell adhesion.

00:30:35.220 --> 00:30:39.330
And in contrast to what we've
talked about with the growth

00:30:39.330 --> 00:30:43.110
and survival signaling, where
you have mutations that happen

00:30:43.110 --> 00:30:45.090
in cancer cells,
and you basically

00:30:45.090 --> 00:30:49.450
have an irreversible change
to the genome of the cell,

00:30:49.450 --> 00:30:56.280
this change in the adhesive
properties of the cell,

00:30:56.280 --> 00:30:58.260
and essentially
their cell state--

00:30:58.260 --> 00:31:01.710
because what you see
here, if a cancer cell is

00:31:01.710 --> 00:31:05.790
having less adhesion and
getting more migratory,

00:31:05.790 --> 00:31:09.930
it's switching from an
epithelial type of state

00:31:09.930 --> 00:31:13.080
to a mesenchymal type of state.

00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:23.250
And what this is called is
an epithelial-to-mesenchymal

00:31:23.250 --> 00:31:36.080
transition, and that
is EMT, for short.

00:31:40.030 --> 00:31:43.210
And this EMT is not
a genetic change.

00:31:43.210 --> 00:31:45.940
It's not caused by
a genetic change,

00:31:45.940 --> 00:31:50.230
but it appears that EMT
results from changes

00:31:50.230 --> 00:31:51.800
in gene regulation.

00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:59.590
So you can think of it as
more of an epigenetic change,

00:31:59.590 --> 00:32:07.460
an epigenetic change
in gene expression.

00:32:07.460 --> 00:32:11.350
So there's a change
in gene expression

00:32:11.350 --> 00:32:13.540
such that this can
reverse later on.

00:32:21.730 --> 00:32:25.640
And there are master
regulators of this process,

00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:27.560
which alter gene expression.

00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:32.810
And so the type of gene
that alters gene expression,

00:32:32.810 --> 00:32:35.365
these are often called
transcription factors.

00:32:43.030 --> 00:32:46.150
And there are several
transcription factors

00:32:46.150 --> 00:32:49.165
that are master regulators
of this EMT process.

00:32:51.670 --> 00:32:57.145
And their names
are Twist, Snail--

00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:03.530
another one's called Slug.

00:33:03.530 --> 00:33:04.630
There's an Escargot.

00:33:04.630 --> 00:33:07.330
You can see this got
a little out of hand.

00:33:07.330 --> 00:33:11.140
And you can tell by the
names that they probably

00:33:11.140 --> 00:33:13.330
were not discovered in humans.

00:33:13.330 --> 00:33:16.390
And in fact, these
genes were discovered

00:33:16.390 --> 00:33:19.600
in the same genetic screen
that I outlined before,

00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:21.470
where Hedgehog was discovered.

00:33:21.470 --> 00:33:21.970
OK.

00:33:21.970 --> 00:33:25.750
So it was a genetic
screen in the flies,

00:33:25.750 --> 00:33:30.100
and these are genes that affect
the embryonic development

00:33:30.100 --> 00:33:32.260
of the fly.

00:33:32.260 --> 00:33:37.610
And I'll show you this
view of the fly embryo.

00:33:37.610 --> 00:33:39.760
So this is an embryo
here, and you see,

00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:43.690
it's an epithelial sheet
surrounding the yolk.

00:33:43.690 --> 00:33:47.230
And what happens is, in
early stages of development,

00:33:47.230 --> 00:33:51.100
a population of cells
express the Twist gene.

00:33:51.100 --> 00:33:54.130
So that's Twist
in the dark here.

00:33:54.130 --> 00:33:58.720
And this Twist gene causes
these cells to basically invade

00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:01.480
into the middle of the embryo.

00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:03.430
So here are the Twist
cells now, going

00:34:03.430 --> 00:34:06.400
into the inside of the embryo.

00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:08.530
And then these
cells undergo EMT,

00:34:08.530 --> 00:34:12.489
and they start to migrate
around inside the embryo.

00:34:12.489 --> 00:34:14.770
What this is doing
for the fly is

00:34:14.770 --> 00:34:17.139
that these are the
cells that are going on

00:34:17.139 --> 00:34:19.889
to form the muscle.

00:34:19.889 --> 00:34:21.395
And if you look
at your neighbor,

00:34:21.395 --> 00:34:23.020
you might notice that
their muscles are

00:34:23.020 --> 00:34:25.210
on the inside of their body.

00:34:25.210 --> 00:34:31.480
So this process is basically
putting these cells,

00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:33.880
by getting them to move,
it's putting the cells

00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:35.889
in the right place
for what they are

00:34:35.889 --> 00:34:39.460
going to differentiate into
during embryonic development.

00:34:42.370 --> 00:34:46.659
But this process, if
activated during cancer,

00:34:46.659 --> 00:34:51.310
can allow these cells to be more
mobile and to leave one organ

00:34:51.310 --> 00:34:54.010
and go into another organ.

00:34:54.010 --> 00:34:58.030
So cancer isn't inventing
anything new here.

00:34:58.030 --> 00:35:01.930
It's corrupting a normal
program that cells have and need

00:35:01.930 --> 00:35:04.750
during development, and
it's inactivating it

00:35:04.750 --> 00:35:07.870
at an inappropriate time.

00:35:07.870 --> 00:35:10.750
So these are all
transcription factors.

00:35:10.750 --> 00:35:14.410
And what they do
is, they repress

00:35:14.410 --> 00:35:18.880
the expression or
function of cadherin

00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:23.290
such that the cells are
no longer as sticky.

00:35:23.290 --> 00:35:25.990
So basically, when these
transcription factors

00:35:25.990 --> 00:35:28.120
get turned on, it
makes the cells

00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:30.470
less sticky to each other.

00:35:30.470 --> 00:35:32.890
And it also promotes
their migration.

00:35:32.890 --> 00:35:35.710
So it turns on genes that
are important for migration.

00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:44.200
This process of EMT, as I
mentioned, is reversible,

00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:47.410
and it also involves
interactions between tumor

00:35:47.410 --> 00:35:49.820
and stromal cells.

00:35:49.820 --> 00:35:52.600
I'll show you an example of--

00:35:52.600 --> 00:35:57.010
so in the fly embryo, one thing
that's nice about the flies

00:35:57.010 --> 00:36:00.790
is, you can actually
watch this happen live.

00:36:00.790 --> 00:36:04.150
And so I'm going to show
you a movie now, showing you

00:36:04.150 --> 00:36:06.352
the invasion process.

00:36:06.352 --> 00:36:07.810
We're going to have
an embryo here.

00:36:13.460 --> 00:36:15.190
And what I'm going
to show you is,

00:36:15.190 --> 00:36:18.980
we're looking at the cells that
are expressing Twist and Snail,

00:36:18.980 --> 00:36:21.820
and they're on one
side of the embryo.

00:36:21.820 --> 00:36:25.360
And I'm going to show you a
section of the embryo that

00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:28.480
is analogous to this.

00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:31.360
So when the cells
move inside, they're

00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:33.370
going to disappear
in this movie.

00:36:33.370 --> 00:36:36.700
So when you see the
crease in the embryo,

00:36:36.700 --> 00:36:38.170
that's when the
cells are invading

00:36:38.170 --> 00:36:40.540
into the middle of the embryo.

00:36:40.540 --> 00:36:44.110
And so the cell outlines
are in magenta here.

00:36:44.110 --> 00:36:48.970
And what's labeled in green
is a type of motor protein

00:36:48.970 --> 00:36:52.690
that's involved in the mobility
of cells and, in this case,

00:36:52.690 --> 00:36:54.430
is involved in
these cells moving

00:36:54.430 --> 00:36:57.800
into the interior of the embryo.

00:36:57.800 --> 00:37:00.040
So here, you see the
motor protein appearing,

00:37:00.040 --> 00:37:02.997
and that's when these cells are
going to dive into the embryo.

00:37:02.997 --> 00:37:04.330
So it's almost like a waterfall.

00:37:04.330 --> 00:37:08.560
These cells are moving into
the inside of the embryo

00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:12.850
through this process of
invagination and, subsequently,

00:37:12.850 --> 00:37:14.500
EMT.

00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:15.817
There it goes again.

00:37:15.817 --> 00:37:17.650
You can see the cells
are now on the inside.

00:37:20.260 --> 00:37:23.170
So this process of
EMT also involves

00:37:23.170 --> 00:37:27.910
interactions between the
cancer cells and the stroma.

00:37:27.910 --> 00:37:31.323
And that's illustrated here
because what you can see,

00:37:31.323 --> 00:37:32.740
what's being labeled
here, you can

00:37:32.740 --> 00:37:37.090
see the nuclei of the
cells, but these cells

00:37:37.090 --> 00:37:41.140
at the edge of the tumor are
up-regulating this gene, which

00:37:41.140 --> 00:37:45.100
is an alpha-beta integrin, which
I'll mention in just a minute.

00:37:45.100 --> 00:37:47.110
And this is getting
up-regulated right where

00:37:47.110 --> 00:37:49.360
the tumor contacts the stroma.

00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:51.430
And this gene,
alpha-beta integrin,

00:37:51.430 --> 00:37:56.200
is a gene that's associated
with motility and EMT.

00:37:56.200 --> 00:38:00.720
So on that slide here, one
gene involved in motility

00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:02.820
is a class of genes
called integrins.

00:38:06.250 --> 00:38:12.070
And so this also results from
the signaling between the tumor

00:38:12.070 --> 00:38:14.390
and the surrounding cells.

00:38:14.390 --> 00:38:17.830
And again, this is not
something that cancer created.

00:38:17.830 --> 00:38:20.750
This is what happens
during wound healing.

00:38:20.750 --> 00:38:24.500
So during wound healing,
if you injure yourself,

00:38:24.500 --> 00:38:27.550
the wound recruits immune
cells, and the immune cells

00:38:27.550 --> 00:38:31.300
signal to the surrounding
skin or epithelial cells

00:38:31.300 --> 00:38:36.010
to undergo EMT in order to
close and fill in the wound.

00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:39.160
So this is a
natural process that

00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:41.650
happens in your body
that is simply getting

00:38:41.650 --> 00:38:43.690
corrupted by cancer cells.

00:38:47.620 --> 00:38:48.120
All right.

00:38:48.120 --> 00:38:51.990
So now let's talk about
this last step of motility.

00:38:54.550 --> 00:39:01.690
So this is now how the cells
would break out and move away.

00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:11.570
Let's come back to
this movie here.

00:39:11.570 --> 00:39:14.950
There are a few things I want
you to notice about this movie.

00:39:14.950 --> 00:39:19.690
The first is, holy shit,
that cell is moving.

00:39:19.690 --> 00:39:26.890
And so the first aspect of this
is, because the cell is moving,

00:39:26.890 --> 00:39:31.090
it suggests that there's some
sort of force being generated.

00:39:31.090 --> 00:39:39.930
So the cell is generating force.

00:39:39.930 --> 00:39:43.100
And I'm not talking about like
some type of mystical Jedi

00:39:43.100 --> 00:39:43.880
force.

00:39:43.880 --> 00:39:48.020
I'm talking about the mass
times acceleration force,

00:39:48.020 --> 00:39:50.450
so like a physical force, OK?

00:39:50.450 --> 00:39:53.840
The second thing I want to
point out about this movie

00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:57.500
is that you see that bacterium,
and it's moving around,

00:39:57.500 --> 00:40:00.590
this cell is able to
follow that bacterium.

00:40:00.590 --> 00:40:03.650
So the cell, in the
force generation process,

00:40:03.650 --> 00:40:06.500
is very responsive
to the signals

00:40:06.500 --> 00:40:08.750
that that cell is getting.

00:40:08.750 --> 00:40:12.560
So the cell is generating
force, and this force

00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:14.255
is responsive to signals.

00:40:22.790 --> 00:40:24.860
So for the remaining
part of the lecture,

00:40:24.860 --> 00:40:26.510
I basically just
want to tell you

00:40:26.510 --> 00:40:30.590
about how it is that the cell
generates the force required

00:40:30.590 --> 00:40:34.250
to move itself around.

00:40:34.250 --> 00:40:38.580
And it involves a
particular type of protein.

00:40:38.580 --> 00:40:40.520
It's a component of
the cytoskeleton,

00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:42.650
and we've talked
about microtubules

00:40:42.650 --> 00:40:45.020
and the microtubule
cytoskeleton and its role

00:40:45.020 --> 00:40:47.060
in segregating the chromosome.

00:40:47.060 --> 00:40:51.470
But there are other cytoskeletal
systems that the cell has,

00:40:51.470 --> 00:40:55.280
and one is called the
actin cytoskeleton, which

00:40:55.280 --> 00:40:58.940
is shown on the side above.

00:40:58.940 --> 00:41:02.600
And actin, the
actin cytoskeleton,

00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:06.030
is a system that is a
biopolymer in the cell.

00:41:06.030 --> 00:41:11.870
So this is a biopolymer,
like microtubules.

00:41:11.870 --> 00:41:14.130
And actin is a gene.

00:41:14.130 --> 00:41:18.450
And the actin gene encodes for
a protein, the actin protein,

00:41:18.450 --> 00:41:21.610
and when the actin protein
is made in the cell,

00:41:21.610 --> 00:41:26.780
it starts out as being just
a single globular protein.

00:41:26.780 --> 00:41:29.960
And when the actin
is in this state,

00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:35.000
it is called
globular or G-actin.

00:41:38.510 --> 00:41:41.870
But these subunits,
these proteins,

00:41:41.870 --> 00:41:45.410
can come together
and form a polymer.

00:41:45.410 --> 00:41:49.640
So they can go from being
individual, isolated proteins

00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:53.465
to forming a polymer that
forms a long skinny filament.

00:41:59.990 --> 00:42:05.120
And this form of the protein
that's forming a biopolymer

00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:08.210
is known as
filamentous or F-actin.

00:42:18.130 --> 00:42:20.740
And these are long,
skinny filaments.

00:42:20.740 --> 00:42:23.620
They can be hundreds
of nanometers,

00:42:23.620 --> 00:42:28.600
even microns, in length, so
hundreds of nanometers long.

00:42:28.600 --> 00:42:32.050
And the filament width
is about 10 nanometers.

00:42:32.050 --> 00:42:34.540
So I'm just trying to give
you a sense of dimensions,

00:42:34.540 --> 00:42:40.120
that this is a long, skinny
filament that the cell can

00:42:40.120 --> 00:42:40.930
assemble.

00:42:40.930 --> 00:42:44.260
And it assembles into these
dense meshworks, which you

00:42:44.260 --> 00:42:47.230
can see in the slide up here.

00:42:47.230 --> 00:42:49.340
So this is the leading
edge of the cell.

00:42:49.340 --> 00:42:51.640
So the cell would be
migrating this way.

00:42:51.640 --> 00:42:57.520
And what you see in this cell is
this densely branched network,

00:42:57.520 --> 00:43:00.220
and these are all
actin filaments.

00:43:00.220 --> 00:43:05.350
So you get this huge dense
forest of actin filaments

00:43:05.350 --> 00:43:08.635
that's right at the edge of the
cell that is moving forward.

00:43:11.650 --> 00:43:15.370
One thing I want to point out
is, like all things in biology,

00:43:15.370 --> 00:43:17.990
this is not a one-way street.

00:43:17.990 --> 00:43:21.740
And so these biopolymers
are very dynamic,

00:43:21.740 --> 00:43:24.640
meaning they can undergo
assembly and disassembly,

00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:28.960
and they can do so on
the timescale of seconds.

00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:32.410
One last thing I want to point
out about the actin filament

00:43:32.410 --> 00:43:36.280
is, there's a polarity
to the filament such

00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:39.190
that there's an end,
known as the plus end,

00:43:39.190 --> 00:43:41.320
where growth is
favored, and there's

00:43:41.320 --> 00:43:43.840
an end, known as the
minus end, where there's

00:43:43.840 --> 00:43:45.760
often de-polymerization.

00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:49.720
So you can get a directional
growth of the filament.

00:43:49.720 --> 00:43:51.130
So this is where growth happens.

00:43:55.370 --> 00:43:58.180
And so in this network
that you're looking at,

00:43:58.180 --> 00:44:00.190
the way the actin is oriented--

00:44:00.190 --> 00:44:03.520
so I'm going to draw
just a cell here--

00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:11.830
you have this dense meshwork
of actin, and in this meshwork,

00:44:11.830 --> 00:44:14.590
there's a polarity to the
way the actin filaments are

00:44:14.590 --> 00:44:15.740
oriented.

00:44:15.740 --> 00:44:18.340
So the cell is
migrating this way,

00:44:18.340 --> 00:44:21.100
and the plus ends of
the actin filaments

00:44:21.100 --> 00:44:23.740
are facing out right
at the surface.

00:44:23.740 --> 00:44:27.310
And the minus ends
are back here.

00:44:27.310 --> 00:44:30.460
And so what you have, when
the cell is migrating,

00:44:30.460 --> 00:44:34.390
is you have this
biopolymer network that's

00:44:34.390 --> 00:44:38.020
growing on this end, but
shrinking on the other end.

00:44:38.020 --> 00:44:42.550
And that allows the cell to
generate a constant protrusive

00:44:42.550 --> 00:44:44.290
force.

00:44:44.290 --> 00:44:47.500
So it's the growth
of actin filaments,

00:44:47.500 --> 00:44:55.620
the growth of F-actin, which
generates a protrusive force.

00:45:04.340 --> 00:45:08.270
Now if we consider the whole
process of cell migration, what

00:45:08.270 --> 00:45:10.640
you can see is that
initially, you're

00:45:10.640 --> 00:45:14.090
going to push the
cell membrane forward.

00:45:14.090 --> 00:45:16.040
So you get a protrusion.

00:45:16.040 --> 00:45:17.690
It pushes it forward.

00:45:17.690 --> 00:45:22.730
That's often called a
lamellipodium, or a pseudopod,

00:45:22.730 --> 00:45:26.220
and so this part of
the cell moves forward.

00:45:26.220 --> 00:45:30.170
But in order for the cell to
have a net motion forward,

00:45:30.170 --> 00:45:32.990
it then has to stabilize
that protrusion.

00:45:32.990 --> 00:45:37.498
And it stabilizes the protrusion
by adhering to the substrate.

00:45:37.498 --> 00:45:39.290
So right now, we're
just considering a cell

00:45:39.290 --> 00:45:43.340
moving on a flat substrate.

00:45:43.340 --> 00:45:46.250
And so the way it
attaches to the substrate

00:45:46.250 --> 00:45:48.155
is through cell matrix adhesion.

00:45:51.170 --> 00:45:53.930
And this cell matrix
adhesion is mediated

00:45:53.930 --> 00:45:57.740
by another type of adhesion
receptor known as an integrin.

00:46:03.860 --> 00:46:07.070
So the cell pushes
forward, anchors itself

00:46:07.070 --> 00:46:10.520
on the substrate, pulls its
body along, and then just

00:46:10.520 --> 00:46:13.980
repeats that cycle
over and over again.

00:46:13.980 --> 00:46:21.560
So the best way I can illustrate
this is, if you think about it,

00:46:21.560 --> 00:46:22.940
you get your protrusion.

00:46:22.940 --> 00:46:24.650
You get your elbow out.

00:46:24.650 --> 00:46:25.580
You put down.

00:46:25.580 --> 00:46:27.480
You anchor.

00:46:27.480 --> 00:46:29.870
And it's just a
repeated cycle, and it's

00:46:29.870 --> 00:46:33.360
able to migrate
across the substrate.

00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:37.010
So it's kind of like a
frontal toe mechanism.

00:46:37.010 --> 00:46:39.350
You have cycles of protrusion.

00:46:39.350 --> 00:46:41.780
You generate
traction, and then you

00:46:41.780 --> 00:46:44.260
pull, in order to translocate.

00:46:44.260 --> 00:46:49.220
And so that's how cells
are migrating intuitively.

00:46:49.220 --> 00:46:54.050
This is just showing you
that cells can pull on stuff.

00:46:54.050 --> 00:46:56.780
So not all cells
migrate in this way.

00:46:56.780 --> 00:46:58.940
I just wanted to say that.

00:46:58.940 --> 00:47:02.270
So 3D cells have
other mechanisms

00:47:02.270 --> 00:47:07.100
to migrate that de-emphasize
this traction mechanism

00:47:07.100 --> 00:47:09.290
that cells have.

00:47:09.290 --> 00:47:11.780
So you can get rid
of all the integrins

00:47:11.780 --> 00:47:15.680
that a cell has, and they're
still able to migrate.

00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:21.060
And that's because 2D
emphasizes the role of adhesion,

00:47:21.060 --> 00:47:23.880
but if you can find the
cell, then the cells

00:47:23.880 --> 00:47:25.630
are able to migrate.

00:47:25.630 --> 00:47:29.880
So what's shown here are
cells that are not confined.

00:47:29.880 --> 00:47:33.150
This is a confined
cell in a micropipette.

00:47:33.150 --> 00:47:35.520
And you can see, it's
the same type of cell,

00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:38.200
but the cell can
migrate in confinement,

00:47:38.200 --> 00:47:42.630
but it can't migrate
outside of confinement.

00:47:42.630 --> 00:47:44.700
So in this sense,
the cell is migrating

00:47:44.700 --> 00:47:46.410
through a different mode.

00:47:46.410 --> 00:47:49.110
And you can think
of it as the cell

00:47:49.110 --> 00:47:51.960
is doing some type of
chimney-ing maneuver.

00:47:51.960 --> 00:47:54.990
So it's able to get in a
confined environment, push out

00:47:54.990 --> 00:47:57.900
against its surroundings,
and that's how the cell then

00:47:57.900 --> 00:48:01.770
is able to generate traction
in the absence of an integrin

00:48:01.770 --> 00:48:04.080
molecule.

00:48:04.080 --> 00:48:04.590
All right.

00:48:04.590 --> 00:48:05.640
Great.

00:48:05.640 --> 00:48:10.070
So we are set for now.

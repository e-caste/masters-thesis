WEBVTT

00:00:15.687 --> 00:00:17.520
TINA SRIVASTRAVA: So
now we're going to dive

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.320
into the flight environment.

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:28.060
All right.

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.923
So the first part is flying.

00:00:31.923 --> 00:00:33.340
Actually, let me
just pause there.

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.382
Were there any other
questions about the charts

00:00:36.382 --> 00:00:37.090
and the airspace?

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.690
OK, good.

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:43.790
They're kind of related
to the flight environment,

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:46.400
so feel free to jump in here.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.250
All right.

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.150
So flying.

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:54.000
So there's a fair amount
of work that a pilot

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.210
is supposed to do-- is actually
required to do before they fly.

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.290
So you're supposed to become
familiar with information

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.090
that pertains to your flight.

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.800
In fact, it's a very
good idea to do so,

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.860
that's exactly how you
become a safe pilot.

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.950
So it's important to
understand information

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.270
related to your flight.

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.800
So there's not only the airport
that you're taking off from--

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.110
and when Phillip talks
about performance,

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.720
he'll talk about the length
of runway that's required,

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.630
but you also want to know
about alternate airports

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:25.500
along your route.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.380
So if I'm flying
from here to Maine,

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.310
for example, there's a lot
of airports along the route,

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.280
I'd want to identify a
couple along the way,

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.000
understand what the weather
forecast is for those airports,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.880
whether or not they have
fuel, those types of things

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.980
are very relevant to know.

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.042
You're also supposed to
understand how much-- so we

00:01:47.042 --> 00:01:49.500
talked about-- so when you talk
about aircraft performance,

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.640
you'll understand what length
of runway you require in order

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.040
to land, and then
you want to make sure

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.020
that the airports
that you've identified

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.730
as alternate airports
along the way

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:04.440
have long enough
runways for you to land.

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.940
So let's talk about
some of the paperwork.

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.060
So there's this
acronym, ARROW, that's

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.700
supposed to help you
remember the types of things

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.190
that you're required to
have inside the airplane.

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.918
So there's an Airworthiness
Certificate, Registration.

00:02:19.918 --> 00:02:21.710
If you're going on an
international flight,

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:23.175
you need a radio license.

00:02:23.175 --> 00:02:24.550
It's actually
pretty easy to get.

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.870
So if you wanted to fly
from here to Canada,

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.870
you only have to pay $60
to get your radio license

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.450
and you can go fly to
Canada, so it's great.

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.750
And also the international
language of aviation

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:36.410
is English.

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.350
So even if you go to Montreal,
you don't have to learn French,

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:43.160
you can speak in English and
land there, so it's great.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.300
So O is the Operating
Limitations,

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.650
those are displayed
in various ways,

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.557
such as your flight
manual and placards,

00:02:50.557 --> 00:02:52.390
and we'll give you some
pictures of placards

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:53.700
so you see what those are.

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.380
And then Weight and
Balance information,

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.590
and we have a whole talk
just about calculating weight

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.730
and balance I think tomorrow.

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.650
So operating limitations.

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.740
So these are real restrictions
on the aircraft in terms

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:10.830
of what is the
maximum speed you can

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.010
fly with and without
your flaps extended,

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.360
and which kind of
procedures can you do.

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.330
And we talked about
certain aircraft

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.820
that you're allowed to do these
fancy aerobatic procedures

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.190
in and other aircraft where
that's not a good idea,

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.550
because if you really push
your aircraft to enter a spin,

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:30.430
it may be very difficult
to recover from it.

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.090
And so there are
different things--

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:36.700
so one is called the POH or
the Pilot's Operating Handbook,

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.070
and I have a POH over
here, and it has a lot

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:40.390
of great information in it.

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:42.182
So pretty much everything
Philip taught you

00:03:42.182 --> 00:03:45.100
about aircraft systems as
is in this book as well.

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.660
It tells you about--

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:51.040
everything about your airplane's
systems, its requirements,

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.250
its restrictions, and how you
calculate that runway length

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:56.710
that you need to land and
your weight and balance,

00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:00.470
all that information
is inside these books.

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:03.100
So this is an example of
some of those limitations

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:05.620
for an SR20 as an example--

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.420
we were talking about
Cirrus aircraft.

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.580
And so you can see, the
same types of numbers

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:13.015
that Philip was pointing out
before, the different V speeds.

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.510
And he had also talked about
these maneuverability limits

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:21.440
as well.

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.040
Minimum flight crew for a
lot of these small airplanes

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.580
is usually one, but some of
the very big, complex airplanes

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.820
and jet aircraft require
the co-pilot as well,

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:36.590
and some airplanes even require
another crew member as well.

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:39.370
So there are certain
aircraft instruments

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:41.410
that you require when you fly.

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:44.870
So they're called
equipment requirements.

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:48.640
So a VFR day, which is
Visual Flight Rules-- so

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:52.000
a nice sunny day, no
clouds, so you'll be doing

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.690
VFR your entire time getting
your private pilot's license

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:58.410
except if you do a couple
days of instrument training,

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:00.460
but the vast majority
of time, you're

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:03.040
talking about a VFR flight.

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:06.940
So what do you need, you need
some of those key instruments

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:09.160
we were just talking about--
your airspeed indicator,

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:13.270
your altimeter, a compass,
and then a couple of things

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:14.250
related to the engine.

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:16.810
So you understand about
the engine, its oil

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:19.220
pressure, temperature,
and you need

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:21.183
to know things about your fuel.

00:05:21.183 --> 00:05:22.600
And a lot of them
have alternates,

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.820
you could measure your
fuel from different ways,

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:26.620
but somehow you must
have a fuel gauge

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:27.970
to know how much fuel you have.

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:33.440
You also need to have
anti-collision strobe

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:37.550
lights that kind go
off, and seat belts.

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:39.470
Who knows what an ELT is?

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:43.803
Yes?

00:05:43.803 --> 00:05:45.470
AUDIENCE: Emergency
locator transmitter?

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:46.762
TINA SRIVASTRAVA: That's right.

00:05:46.762 --> 00:05:51.860
And so that-- it's an emergency
device that basically activates

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:54.650
when your aircraft-- if
your aircraft is under

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:56.930
duress and is
descending very rapidly,

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:00.260
it goes off and emits
your location out so

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:04.525
that people can come and find
your aircraft very quickly.

00:06:04.525 --> 00:06:07.150
There are also some-- and these
numbers, by the way at the top,

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:09.550
in case it wasn't
clear, are regulations.

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:10.840
So they're FAA regulations.

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:16.720
So 91.105 is a regulation about
pilots sitting in their seat

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:18.190
when you're flying the airplane.

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:21.220
So for all practical purposes,
when you guys were flying,

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:25.180
you have to sit down and be
the pilot and fly the airplane.

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:26.870
This isn't like a
big commercial jet

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:28.828
we're going to get up
and start walking around,

00:06:28.828 --> 00:06:30.760
so you need you need
to basically sit down.

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:35.740
Seat belts.

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:37.780
As a pilot in
command, you also get

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:39.460
to make the rules
for your flight.

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:42.160
So if you think you have some
kind of rowdy passengers,

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:45.090
you just tell them the rule
is you must wear your seat

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:47.960
belt at all times.

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:52.247
The actuality is that there are
certain times and restrictions

00:06:52.247 --> 00:06:53.080
where it's required.

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:55.360
So taxi, takeoff,
landing is required

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:58.330
to wear your seat belt, but you
can extend that rule and say,

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:02.610
at all times you must
always wear your seat belt.

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:04.590
There's also an
interesting regulation

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:08.010
that says that passengers
can't interfere with the crew

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:09.862
members, but I will
point out that depending

00:07:09.862 --> 00:07:11.820
on who your passengers
are, they may or may not

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:15.830
comply with that regulation.

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:18.920
We already talked about the
different altimeter settings.

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:22.160
So kind of-- it can be the
case that you-- instead

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:25.910
of being the perfect
condition of 29.92,

00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:27.620
it might be the
case that you need

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:31.430
to adjust your altimeter
to that local setting.

00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:34.160
So we talked about
ADS where you can

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:36.350
dial in the frequency
of the ADS and it

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:38.360
announces the
weather information

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:39.800
for a particular area.

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:42.530
They will provide
the setting that you

00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:44.990
need to set in that window.

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:51.350
So they'll say 29.98 or whatever
is the altimeter setting.

00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:53.690
Also, if you're flying
over a bunch of places

00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:55.520
and you're talking to
air traffic control,

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:58.040
they will update you-- if they
hand you from one air traffic

00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:00.110
controller to another
air traffic controller,

00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:01.610
one of the first
things they'll tell

00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:04.460
you is what is the altimeter
setting for that area

00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:06.860
so that everybody is
adjusted and everybody

00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:09.930
knows what altitude they're at.

00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:12.930
So there's a little
knob on your dial,

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:15.690
and you turn it until
that window on the right

00:08:15.690 --> 00:08:17.740
says the right number.

00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:19.650
Now if that's not
available, you already

00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:22.620
have some information, which
is the airport elevation.

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:25.380
So also on those things
being passed around,

00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:28.120
for a given airport, it tells
you what the elevation is.

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:31.770
So for example, if you know
that the airport is at 100 feet

00:08:31.770 --> 00:08:33.630
elevation, you can
just-- and you're

00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:37.200
sitting on the ground in your
aircraft getting your airplane

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:39.330
set up before you take
off, then you know

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:41.820
that you're at that 100 feet.

00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:45.960
So you can just keep turning
the dial until it says 100 feet,

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:49.980
and then that'll actually give
you the setting in the window.

00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:56.825
There's some restriction--
yes, go ahead.

00:08:56.825 --> 00:08:58.940
AUDIENCE: What if you're flying
into an uncontrolled airport

00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:00.440
or you don't have
altimeter setting?

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:02.450
How do you [INAUDIBLE]?

00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:04.320
TINA SRIVASTRAVA: So
that happens a lot.

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:08.630
So you can basically look
at the nearest airport

00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:09.885
is probably the best way.

00:09:09.885 --> 00:09:11.510
And those are the
times that you really

00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:13.635
want to keep in mind what
Philip was talking about,

00:09:13.635 --> 00:09:17.570
that if you are going from
a hot place to a cold place,

00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:20.150
you want to keep in mind
that hey, I might actually

00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:23.370
be descending even though
my altimeter says I'm not.

00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:27.140
But in general, if you have a
local setting that's nearby,

00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:28.250
you're pretty much good.

00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:30.543
They don't vary dramatically
unless the weather's

00:09:30.543 --> 00:09:32.210
changing a lot, in
which case you really

00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:33.290
shouldn't be flying
because it means

00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:34.582
there's a huge front coming in.

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:39.520
So here's an airport diagram.

00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:43.000
A lot of information here,
but one thing-- so this

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.400
is actually Bedford.

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:47.170
And so you can see
a couple of things

00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:49.570
you wouldn't see at other
places, such as the US Air

00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:51.455
Force ramp.

00:09:51.455 --> 00:09:53.080
That's not going to
be at other places.

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:56.440
But you basically see these
two intersecting black lines.

00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:58.580
So those are the main runways.

00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:01.120
And each runway
is bi-directional.

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:02.650
So on one side--

00:10:02.650 --> 00:10:05.710
so it says-- the number's
very small right here next

00:10:05.710 --> 00:10:06.360
to the mouse.

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:07.480
So 11.

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:08.860
So that's runway 11.

00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:10.810
And then on the other
side it says 29.

00:10:10.810 --> 00:10:13.900
So basically you land in one
direction, it's one number;

00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:16.610
if you land in the other
direction, it's another number,

00:10:16.610 --> 00:10:20.380
and that number is corresponding
to the heading of that runway.

00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:23.270
And then you see a bunch
of lighter gray lines.

00:10:23.270 --> 00:10:25.960
So those are the
different taxiways.

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:28.117
And there's all
kinds of stuff here.

00:10:28.117 --> 00:10:29.950
I won't go through
everything, but one thing

00:10:29.950 --> 00:10:35.000
that's really relevant
is this acronym here.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.310
And it kind of
looks like a lasso.

00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:41.270
What it's saying is,
the land and hold short.

00:10:41.270 --> 00:10:43.410
So if you're given
an instruction-- so

00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:45.900
when you have two
intersecting runways,

00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:48.260
they might want to
keep up the efficiency.

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.420
They might want to have
you land while they

00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:54.950
have another airplane taking
off on the other runway.

00:10:54.950 --> 00:10:58.290
And so there is a line that
says that if you given a land

00:10:58.290 --> 00:11:00.290
and hold short instruction,
that you're supposed

00:11:00.290 --> 00:11:02.120
to land-- that you're
supposed to hold short,

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:03.995
you're not supposed to
cross the intersecting

00:11:03.995 --> 00:11:07.250
runway because there's
traffic on that runway.

00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:07.750
Thanks.

00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:13.010
Did everyone get the iPad
had to look at the sectional?

00:11:13.010 --> 00:11:13.510
OK, great.

00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:17.400
Yes?

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:20.480
AUDIENCE: On the sectionals,
I was looking at the Hanscom

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:23.010
area, and I could
not see anything

00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:26.220
indicating the Air Force Base
and getting special symbol.

00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:28.800
Are there special symbols
for military sites

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:31.290
that do have aircraft
taking off and landing?

00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:33.310
And can you explain
what they are?

00:11:33.310 --> 00:11:34.268
TINA SRIVASTRAVA: Yeah.

00:11:34.268 --> 00:11:36.065
So that's restricted
airports, for example.

00:11:36.065 --> 00:11:38.190
So they have a different
color and different symbol

00:11:38.190 --> 00:11:40.140
around them that would indicate
that they're a restricted

00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:40.650
airport.

00:11:40.650 --> 00:11:42.150
One thing that's
kind of interesting

00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:44.275
is that even though Hanscom's
at an Air Force Base,

00:11:44.275 --> 00:11:47.020
it doesn't have any
particular restrictions.

00:11:47.020 --> 00:11:49.140
So you just get a
nice private airport

00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:52.650
that you can land at that
has ginormously long runways,

00:11:52.650 --> 00:11:56.985
so it's just a great
training airport.

00:11:56.985 --> 00:12:00.480
So Philip, I just went ahead
into the flight environment.

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:02.350
PHILIP GREENSPUN: Oh, OK.

00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:05.020
TINA SRIVASTRAVA: So
taxiing in the wind.

00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:07.240
So this is-- what do
I mean by taxiing?

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:10.070
So you must have heard of
this on commercial aircraft.

00:12:10.070 --> 00:12:11.430
So this is when you get from--

00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:14.080
in that case, the jet
bridge out to the runway.

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:17.273
But basically as you're driving
along the different roads

00:12:17.273 --> 00:12:18.940
at the airport that
are not the runway--

00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:23.380
the taxiways, as you're doing
that, there could be wind.

00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:25.840
In general, as we
talked about with regard

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:28.420
to lift earlier in
the day, you know

00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:31.517
you like having the
wind coming at you--

00:12:31.517 --> 00:12:33.100
and we'll get into
performance and why

00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:35.308
it's really bad if the wind's
coming from behind you.

00:12:35.308 --> 00:12:38.410
But usually the wind will be
coming down the active runway.

00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:40.480
They decide which
runway is active usually

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:42.610
by the wind direction.

00:12:42.610 --> 00:12:44.050
So there's a lot
of wind going on,

00:12:44.050 --> 00:12:46.060
and when you're
taxiing to the runway,

00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:48.580
you're probably going
in different directions

00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:50.200
with respect to the wind.

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:52.570
So one thing that's
important is to think about

00:12:52.570 --> 00:12:55.390
while you're taxiing, you have
to make certain corrections

00:12:55.390 --> 00:12:57.950
to your aircraft's controls--

00:12:57.950 --> 00:13:01.960
so to the rudder
and to the ailerons

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:04.030
and the elevator at the back.

00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:07.270
And so when you're
taxing on the ground,

00:13:07.270 --> 00:13:10.810
your rudder is used to actually
make turns on the ground.

00:13:10.810 --> 00:13:13.720
The ailerons and
the elevator need

00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:16.270
to be turned in such a
direction that basically results

00:13:16.270 --> 00:13:17.960
in your airplane
staying on the ground

00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:21.220
and not inadvertently being
lifted up by a gust of air.

00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:25.470
So this airplane
is what we would

00:13:25.470 --> 00:13:28.050
call a tailwheel, because
there's a wheel back here

00:13:28.050 --> 00:13:28.590
at the tail.

00:13:28.590 --> 00:13:32.040
So it has two wheels up front
and a tailwheel in the back.

00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:36.090
A tricycle gear airplane
would have one big wheel

00:13:36.090 --> 00:13:38.700
up at the front and
then two wheels--

00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:41.430
so three wheels total, but
instead of a tailwheel,

00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:42.840
it has one wheel up front.

00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:45.720
So in this case, a tricycle
wheel-- so not like this,

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:48.480
but with a wheel up
front, what you want to do

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:52.170
is if there's a quartering
tailwind-- so a wind

00:13:52.170 --> 00:13:55.480
coming from behind you from the
back, you want to dive away.

00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:58.080
So you want to turn
your ailerons away

00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:03.060
and you want to push forward
to dive away from the wind.

00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:06.330
And if the wind is coming
from the front, a headwind,

00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:11.490
you want to actually go into
the wind with your aileron,

00:14:11.490 --> 00:14:13.810
and you want your
elevator to be neutral.

00:14:13.810 --> 00:14:15.810
So instead of pushing
in or pulling back,

00:14:15.810 --> 00:14:18.070
you just want it to be neutral.

00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:20.070
It doesn't matter as
much for heavy airplanes,

00:14:20.070 --> 00:14:22.570
but for literal airplanes,
you can get bounced around.

00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:24.598
And so it's slightly
different for a tailwheel,

00:14:24.598 --> 00:14:26.640
so it's good to figure
out which type of airplane

00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:28.710
you're training on
and get used to how

00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:31.590
you would make those
corrections as you're taxiing.

00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:35.907
There are a lot of runway
markings and taxiway markings.

00:14:35.907 --> 00:14:37.740
One thing I would really
encourage you to do

00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:40.920
is that the next time you're
on a commercial flight,

00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:43.920
get a window seat and
look out the window,

00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:47.550
and you can see all these
markings as you go along.

00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:49.050
You might be able
to identify which

00:14:49.050 --> 00:14:50.700
runway you're taking off on.

00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:52.470
And so I won't go
through each of these,

00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:56.820
the actual runway
is this red number.

00:14:56.820 --> 00:14:58.330
So why are there two numbers?

00:14:58.330 --> 00:14:59.885
Why do they have 15 and 33?

00:15:03.028 --> 00:15:05.070
That's right, because
runways are bi-directional.

00:15:05.070 --> 00:15:07.253
So depending on which way
you're taking off on it

00:15:07.253 --> 00:15:08.670
or which way you're
landing on it,

00:15:08.670 --> 00:15:12.210
it could be runway
1-5 or runway 1-3.

00:15:12.210 --> 00:15:18.840
The yellow ones
are talking about--

00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:21.360
there's a difference between
when you're on the runway

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:24.780
or on the taxiway versus it's an
arrow pointing to it somewhere

00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:25.510
else.

00:15:25.510 --> 00:15:29.790
So this sign is on the
one that you're on,

00:15:29.790 --> 00:15:34.320
and this one is saying-- so
if you see this A like this,

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:36.150
it means you're
on taxiway alpha.

00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:38.040
If you see it like
this with an arrow,

00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:42.190
it's says that way
to taxiway bravo.

00:15:42.190 --> 00:15:45.820
It's very important that you do
visual scanning-- so you really

00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:48.580
look around for other airplanes.

00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:51.130
So when we talk about
Visual Flight Rules, VFR,

00:15:51.130 --> 00:15:52.870
which is the vast
majority of your time

00:15:52.870 --> 00:15:56.020
on your private
pilot, you need to be

00:15:56.020 --> 00:15:59.290
looking outside the airplane
to look for other airplanes

00:15:59.290 --> 00:16:01.300
to avoid.

00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:03.520
And it's unfortunate,
but actually,

00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:06.388
most mid-air collisions occur
near airports in good weather.

00:16:06.388 --> 00:16:07.930
So if they had been
looking out, they

00:16:07.930 --> 00:16:09.550
could have seen the
other airplanes.

00:16:09.550 --> 00:16:11.110
So when we're talking
about the pros and cons

00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:13.180
of low wing and high
wing, I was very focused

00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:15.460
on your visibility.

00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:17.620
So where you're
looking in terms of you

00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:19.690
want to clear before
you make any turn,

00:16:19.690 --> 00:16:21.370
you want to look before you go.

00:16:21.370 --> 00:16:25.330
In fact, Mark Nathanson, the FAA
examiner who's coming tomorrow,

00:16:25.330 --> 00:16:28.810
that's probably the easiest
way to fail your FAA exam.

00:16:28.810 --> 00:16:32.300
He'll tell you to do a maneuver
and you just start doing it.

00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:33.040
Fail.

00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:35.980
You have to first
clear the area,

00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:37.470
you might even do
a clearing turn.

00:16:37.470 --> 00:16:39.640
So turn in one direction
and turn the other way,

00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:42.113
because you know your wings
are kind of obscuring you,

00:16:42.113 --> 00:16:43.780
so that you can look
all the way around,

00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:45.780
make sure there are no
aircraft in the vicinity,

00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:47.590
and then perform your maneuvers.

00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:51.070
But of course, you
can also talk to air

00:16:51.070 --> 00:16:54.180
traffic control and other folks
to get traffic advisories.

00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:56.990
They will tell you, hey,
there's an aircraft at your 3

00:16:56.990 --> 00:17:00.040
o'clock 5 miles ahead of you.

00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:02.090
Those types of things
are very helpful.

00:17:02.090 --> 00:17:05.589
They're not always required,
but they're recommended.

00:17:05.589 --> 00:17:07.780
So before we talk
about right of way,

00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:10.839
I thought I would just
challenge you with a question.

00:17:10.839 --> 00:17:12.880
Who do you think has
the right of way,

00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:18.639
a blimp, an aircraft refueling
another aircraft, or a glider?

00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:26.040
So we're just
going to do a poll.

00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:29.850
So how many people for blimp?

00:17:29.850 --> 00:17:31.840
We've got about 20
people for blimp.

00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:32.340
OK.

00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:35.730
How many people for aircraft
refueling another aircraft?

00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:41.240
That was almost the same
number, 20 people on aircraft

00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:42.480
refueling another aircraft.

00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:45.240
How many people for glider?

00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:50.450
OK, glider has the majority
of the classroom here.

00:17:50.450 --> 00:17:53.900
So the majority of the
classroom wins, it's the glider.

00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:55.970
And this is a very
complicated question.

00:17:55.970 --> 00:17:59.330
Obviously you would never be
in a situation where a blimp,

00:17:59.330 --> 00:18:01.010
an aircraft refueling
another aircraft,

00:18:01.010 --> 00:18:04.880
and a glider all coming
together head-on, but the--

00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:06.190
PHILIP GREENSPUN: Burning Man.

00:18:06.190 --> 00:18:07.148
TINA SRIVASTRAVA: Yeah.

00:18:07.148 --> 00:18:11.600
So the glider wins
because it is unpowered.

00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:14.900
And so unpowered
aircraft have a priority

00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:16.950
over all powered aircraft.

00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:20.343
However, if you're in a
glider and you see a blimp,

00:18:20.343 --> 00:18:22.010
you know those things
are slow, I really

00:18:22.010 --> 00:18:25.080
suggest avoiding it anyway.

00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:26.970
So there are a bunch
of right of way rules

00:18:26.970 --> 00:18:32.100
that are all described
in FAR 91.113.

00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:35.363
And so it basically talks
about the order of operations.

00:18:35.363 --> 00:18:36.780
And kind of the
big things to know

00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:39.960
is that if anybody is in
distress or has an emergency,

00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:42.720
they usually just get
priority over everybody else.

00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:45.402
Balloons can't really move
that much and they can't decide

00:18:45.402 --> 00:18:46.860
where they're going,
so even if you

00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:48.443
wanted to assert
right of way, they're

00:18:48.443 --> 00:18:49.860
not going to be able to move.

00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:52.500
But then it really
is aircraft that

00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:56.640
are unpowered get the priority.

00:18:56.640 --> 00:19:00.180
There's also-- if you have
multiple aircraft that are

00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:02.190
of the same class--

00:19:02.190 --> 00:19:06.620
so two airplanes, two powered
airplanes coming at each other,

00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:08.880
how do you decide who
has the right of way?

00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:12.300
So there are some situations
which is basically

00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:14.580
that two aircraft
that are converging

00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:17.940
that are of the same category,
the aircraft on the right

00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:18.900
has the right of way.

00:19:22.993 --> 00:19:25.160
So there are a couple of
figures that describe that.

00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:28.260
So basically if two aircraft
craft are looking head-on,

00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:30.538
then you both you both
move to the right.

00:19:30.538 --> 00:19:32.080
It's good to have
that rule of thumb.

00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:33.420
Yes?

00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:36.803
AUDIENCE: Going back
to the priority list,

00:19:36.803 --> 00:19:39.910
what category would
blimp fall on?

00:19:39.910 --> 00:19:42.460
TINA SRIVASTRAVA: The blimp
is a powered aircraft.

00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:44.955
Yeah, it's very slowly
powered, but it is powered,

00:19:44.955 --> 00:19:46.330
and so it is it
powered aircraft.

00:19:49.450 --> 00:19:51.370
If I said balloon
instead of blimp,

00:19:51.370 --> 00:19:53.802
then the balloon would have won.

00:19:53.802 --> 00:19:56.780
Yeah.

00:19:56.780 --> 00:20:00.530
The balloon-- sorry,
the blimp is also

00:20:00.530 --> 00:20:02.460
frequently called an airship.

00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:07.628
So the FAA question might refer
to the blimp as an airship.

00:20:07.628 --> 00:20:09.020
OK.

00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:12.310
So this was the right of way.

00:20:12.310 --> 00:20:13.160
And then-- yes.

00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:17.210
So one thing that alters it is
if you have an aircraft that's

00:20:17.210 --> 00:20:20.030
landing and it's on final
approach to landing,

00:20:20.030 --> 00:20:23.240
then it has the right
of way, really, to land.

00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:31.950
So this is where we talked
about the balloon has

00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:33.810
priority over all the
others, the glider

00:20:33.810 --> 00:20:36.280
has priority over all--

00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:37.260
over powered aircraft.

00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:40.050
The airship or the
blimp has the priority

00:20:40.050 --> 00:20:42.960
over all other powered aircraft.

00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:45.480
And then if you're
towing or refueling,

00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:47.590
then you have that
priority as well.

00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:50.430
So this is a little diagram
that shows you that--

00:20:50.430 --> 00:20:53.352
it's very unlikely that you will
encounter an aircraft refueling

00:20:53.352 --> 00:20:54.060
another aircraft.

00:20:58.060 --> 00:21:02.570
So one thing to know is also
just minimum safe altitudes.

00:21:02.570 --> 00:21:07.600
So in general, you're
the pilot in command.

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:10.420
You need to ensure
the safety of yourself

00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:12.460
and your plane and
your passengers.

00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:15.220
So in order to do that,
the biggest consideration

00:21:15.220 --> 00:21:17.620
is that you're flying at an
altitude that's safe enough

00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:20.020
that if something went
wrong in your airplane,

00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:22.390
you would be able
to land safely.

00:21:22.390 --> 00:21:25.000
So it's always good, regardless
of where you're flying,

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.530
to keep an eye out on
where's the closest airport

00:21:27.530 --> 00:21:30.250
or where's the closest
flat, clear field

00:21:30.250 --> 00:21:33.010
that you could land in, and you
want to be at an altitude such

00:21:33.010 --> 00:21:34.690
that if you had
an engine failure,

00:21:34.690 --> 00:21:38.590
you could make it safely to
that place and land safely.

00:21:38.590 --> 00:21:40.820
So that's why even
though technically

00:21:40.820 --> 00:21:42.970
in some of this
Class Golf airspace,

00:21:42.970 --> 00:21:47.230
you could be flying at
100 feet above the ground,

00:21:47.230 --> 00:21:49.960
unless it's a very, very
flat desert where you could

00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:55.600
land anywhere, it's not a good
idea if you can't safely land.

00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:57.370
Over a congested
area, which we talked

00:21:57.370 --> 00:22:01.180
about is that yellow
area on the sectional,

00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:02.510
you have to be higher.

00:22:02.510 --> 00:22:05.600
So the idea is just not
to be a nuisance when

00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:08.360
one's very congested.

00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:11.530
And then do you want to
talk to helicopters at all?

00:22:11.530 --> 00:22:13.150
Helicopters can do
whatever they want

00:22:13.150 --> 00:22:14.442
is the ultimate rule of thumb.

00:22:14.442 --> 00:22:15.400
PHILIP GREENSPUN: Yeah.

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:16.743
So basically--

00:22:16.743 --> 00:22:18.160
TINA SRIVASTRAVA:
Actually, your--

00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:19.210
sorry, your mic is over here.

00:22:19.210 --> 00:22:19.630
PHILIP GREENSPUN: I
don't need the mic,

00:22:19.630 --> 00:22:21.880
because I'll get up here,
this is louder than the mic.

00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:26.140
So basically with a helicopter,
just listen to the airplane.

00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:29.052
It's OK to lose the
machine and yourself.

00:22:29.052 --> 00:22:30.820
So you can fly over
downtown Boston

00:22:30.820 --> 00:22:33.520
quite low as long as you can
always end up in the Charles

00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:35.280
River, for example.

00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:36.880
But you can't go below the--

00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:38.230
there are no arbitrary numbers.

00:22:38.230 --> 00:22:40.690
You would just say, well
look, I could auto-rotated

00:22:40.690 --> 00:22:43.600
to the street, or I could have
auto-rotated into the river,

00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:46.340
and I wouldn't have destroyed
somebody else's building

00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:48.760
or car.

00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:52.600
So that's the only
rule for helicopters.

00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:55.450
Don't fly super low when
there's an FAA safety

00:22:55.450 --> 00:22:58.570
inspector actually in
your helicopter with you.

00:22:58.570 --> 00:23:01.927
That's a good rule of thumb

00:23:01.927 --> 00:23:04.510
TINA SRIVASTRAVA: Another thing
that's very important that you

00:23:04.510 --> 00:23:05.620
just--

00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:07.480
you don't be
careless or reckless.

00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:09.010
So you're not
supposed to endanger

00:23:09.010 --> 00:23:11.930
people's lives or property.

00:23:11.930 --> 00:23:13.870
We talked a little
bit about placards

00:23:13.870 --> 00:23:16.970
and how they can have
restrictions on them.

00:23:16.970 --> 00:23:18.670
So this is what we
mean by a placard.

00:23:18.670 --> 00:23:23.740
So they're just things that
are fixed to your airplane,

00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:27.130
and it has some instructions,
whatever it's talking about.

00:23:27.130 --> 00:23:29.920
These in particular,
for example, some of the

00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:32.560
never exceed speeds
are listed, when

00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:35.020
you need to turn on a strobe
light is restrict-- is

00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:37.760
indicated, for example.

00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:40.600
So I think is really interesting
about dropping objects.

00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:44.680
There isn't a rule that says
you can't throw stuff out

00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:48.850
of your airplane, it just as
that you have to know what--

00:23:48.850 --> 00:23:51.370
where what you're
throwing will land such

00:23:51.370 --> 00:23:53.570
that it doesn't
damage any property.

00:23:53.570 --> 00:23:57.970
So there's some interesting
pumpkin festivals around here

00:23:57.970 --> 00:24:00.970
that in the October time frame,
they'll give you pumpkins

00:24:00.970 --> 00:24:03.970
and you can throw pumpkins
outside your airplane

00:24:03.970 --> 00:24:06.437
and try to hit a giant X
in the middle of a field,

00:24:06.437 --> 00:24:08.020
and there's no rule
against it as long

00:24:08.020 --> 00:24:09.730
as you don't damage
any property,

00:24:09.730 --> 00:24:12.100
so it's kind of interesting.

00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:15.550
Formation flight is
kind of cool, too.

00:24:15.550 --> 00:24:18.040
Obviously you can't do anything
that would be hazardous,

00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:21.850
but if you are in communication
with another pilot,

00:24:21.850 --> 00:24:24.320
you decided in advance
that you wanted to do it,

00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:25.010
you can do this.

00:24:25.010 --> 00:24:28.810
So I actually had one
MIT flying club flight,

00:24:28.810 --> 00:24:31.600
three airplanes that
were part of the fly-out

00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:34.000
decided they wanted to do
this, including myself.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:38.140
And so we had three airplanes,
and we were nowhere near

00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:40.570
as close as these planes
are to each other,

00:24:40.570 --> 00:24:43.120
but we were in constant
communication with each other

00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:44.703
and we were watching
each other and it

00:24:44.703 --> 00:24:46.900
was really cool to
kind of fly together,

00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:49.240
and we actually
landed as a flight--

00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:52.300
so instead of each having our
own tail number identified

00:24:52.300 --> 00:24:54.010
to an airport when
we were landing,

00:24:54.010 --> 00:24:57.040
we picked an airport with an
extremely long runway and tower

00:24:57.040 --> 00:25:00.370
controller, and we said, we want
to land as a flight of three.

00:25:00.370 --> 00:25:04.740
And so they give us
clearance and basically--

00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:08.330
a Cessna doesn't require
that much space to land.

00:25:08.330 --> 00:25:11.720
You like to have 3,000 feet,
but 2,000 feet is pretty good.

00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:15.240
And so this was a runway that
was over 8,000 feet long.

00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:17.490
So we had one person kind
of landing at the front,

00:25:17.490 --> 00:25:20.018
one person in the back, and
the last person touched down

00:25:20.018 --> 00:25:21.560
before the first
person left, so it's

00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:23.600
kind of a formation flight.

00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:26.060
Only do this if you're really
comfortable with doing it.

00:25:26.060 --> 00:25:28.850
You could always decline
and say no, and make sure

00:25:28.850 --> 00:25:31.400
that you are definitely
in communication,

00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:33.830
very good weather,
and you only do this

00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:35.540
if it is a safe thing to do.

00:25:35.540 --> 00:25:37.790
You're in charge as
the pilot of command--

00:25:37.790 --> 00:25:40.340
pilot in command, PIC
of deciding whether it's

00:25:40.340 --> 00:25:42.590
a safe thing to do or not.

00:25:42.590 --> 00:25:45.470
There are also restrictions
about aircraft speed,

00:25:45.470 --> 00:25:50.180
and the joke here is that
if you're flying an SR-71,

00:25:50.180 --> 00:25:54.110
you would actually
stall even at 250 knots,

00:25:54.110 --> 00:25:57.470
so you can fly as fast
as you want pretty much.

00:25:57.470 --> 00:25:58.990
OK, so landing at an airport.

00:25:58.990 --> 00:26:02.920
We discussed a little bit about
the runways and the runway

00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:03.820
headings.

00:26:03.820 --> 00:26:06.250
And so I think it's--

00:26:06.250 --> 00:26:08.230
just in terms of
how did they number

00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:11.560
that runway-- so what
does runway 36 mean?

00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:15.520
Well, it's really referring
to 360 or pointing north,

00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:16.600
but it's rounded.

00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:20.800
So in here, it was actually
358, but they rounded it up

00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:22.390
to runway 36.

00:26:22.390 --> 00:26:24.320
And every now and again
they update these,

00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:28.270
so you might see an airport
change its heading number

00:26:28.270 --> 00:26:31.230
because it's that
magnetic heading.

00:26:31.230 --> 00:26:35.330
If there are more than one
runways that are parallel,

00:26:35.330 --> 00:26:38.290
then they can say left.

00:26:38.290 --> 00:26:43.330
So Runway 21 Left or Runway
21 Right or C for Center.

00:26:43.330 --> 00:26:47.770
Or if they have four runways,
they'll usually just pretend

00:26:47.770 --> 00:26:50.890
that one's at a slightly
different degree

00:26:50.890 --> 00:26:52.930
than the other ones,
so that one side

00:26:52.930 --> 00:26:56.350
will be Runway 6 Left and
6 Right and then 7 Left

00:26:56.350 --> 00:26:59.740
and 7 Right, you know they're
all basically parallel.

00:26:59.740 --> 00:27:02.030
So there are a lot of
different runway markings.

00:27:02.030 --> 00:27:05.690
These kind of arrows here talk
about a displaced threshold.

00:27:05.690 --> 00:27:07.480
So what are the
restrictions there?

00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:10.617
So you can feel free to taxi
and take off on that space,

00:27:10.617 --> 00:27:11.950
but you're not supposed to land.

00:27:11.950 --> 00:27:15.280
So you're supposed to cross
that big solid white line

00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:18.148
before you land right here.

00:27:22.780 --> 00:27:24.780
So there are a ton of
different runway markings.

00:27:24.780 --> 00:27:26.250
Again, I encourage
you, even when

00:27:26.250 --> 00:27:27.660
you're on a commercial
flight, to keep

00:27:27.660 --> 00:27:30.180
your head out the window looking
at all the different lines

00:27:30.180 --> 00:27:32.610
that you see so you can
leave the runway threshold,

00:27:32.610 --> 00:27:35.102
you can see the number of the
runway that's written there,

00:27:35.102 --> 00:27:36.810
and then there are
different stripes that

00:27:36.810 --> 00:27:38.310
indicate how far down you are--

00:27:38.310 --> 00:27:41.940
1,000 feet, every 500
feet, for example.

00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:45.182
We talked about the X.
What does the X mean?

00:27:45.182 --> 00:27:45.890
AUDIENCE: Closed.

00:27:45.890 --> 00:27:46.932
TINA SRIVASTRAVA: Closed.

00:27:46.932 --> 00:27:47.670
Don't land there.

00:27:47.670 --> 00:27:48.545
The runway is closed.

00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:55.410
So all of these
are kind of defined

00:27:55.410 --> 00:27:58.250
in the PHAK, the Pilot's
Handbook of Aeronautical

00:27:58.250 --> 00:27:58.750
Knowledge.

00:27:58.750 --> 00:28:00.570
So I would kind of refresh them.

00:28:00.570 --> 00:28:03.130
Some of them were
not very common.

00:28:03.130 --> 00:28:06.077
One thing here is that
windsocks, windsocks are great.

00:28:06.077 --> 00:28:07.660
There are different
kinds of windsocks

00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:09.702
that basically tells you
which direction the wind

00:28:09.702 --> 00:28:11.340
is blowing in.

00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:13.608
When it's a very windy
day or gusty day,

00:28:13.608 --> 00:28:15.900
it's very important to look
at a windsock, because even

00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:17.640
though it will tell you--

00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:19.290
for example, if
you hear on the ADS

00:28:19.290 --> 00:28:22.950
that the winds
are 10 gusting 25,

00:28:22.950 --> 00:28:25.860
that means that the winds are
10 knots, but sometimes a gust

00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:27.450
up to 25 knots.

00:28:27.450 --> 00:28:30.180
And a gust can kind
of change direction.

00:28:30.180 --> 00:28:32.060
So it's very important
to know this,

00:28:32.060 --> 00:28:34.500
and so you might want to
be looking at a windsock

00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:38.250
as you're coming in or as
you're leaving the runway,

00:28:38.250 --> 00:28:40.590
and you want to know which
direction the wind's going

00:28:40.590 --> 00:28:43.440
and how much is it
changing, moving about,

00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:47.670
so that when you come in, you're
prepared for that as you land.

00:28:47.670 --> 00:28:49.710
There are other types
of wind indicators

00:28:49.710 --> 00:28:51.600
that are pretty uncommon.

00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:53.340
I doubt that you'll
encounter them,

00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:56.430
but we've shown them here.

00:28:56.430 --> 00:28:59.280
There's also-- so
the best way to fly

00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:01.200
is really looking out
the window and looking

00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:02.490
at what the runway looks like.

00:29:02.490 --> 00:29:03.960
It's the picture of the runway.

00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:07.372
So look at it, see what it
looks like, that's the best way.

00:29:07.372 --> 00:29:09.330
But there's some things
that might trip you up,

00:29:09.330 --> 00:29:12.540
like if runways are wider or
narrower than you're used to

00:29:12.540 --> 00:29:14.610
or longer or shorter
than you're used to, then

00:29:14.610 --> 00:29:17.310
it might appear to be in a
different place than it is.

00:29:17.310 --> 00:29:20.400
So it's always good to have
an indicator as a backup.

00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:23.840
So there are different
glide-slope indicators.

00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:29.650
So a VASI is one where there
are these four little lights--

00:29:29.650 --> 00:29:31.570
you basically see
them as four lights.

00:29:31.570 --> 00:29:33.310
And if you're too
low, they're red,

00:29:33.310 --> 00:29:35.440
and if you're too high,
they're all white,

00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:36.940
but if you're
right on them about

00:29:36.940 --> 00:29:38.980
1,000 feet down the runway--

00:29:38.980 --> 00:29:41.230
so you basically use
these as you're coming in,

00:29:41.230 --> 00:29:44.320
but once you can really see the
runway out the window yourself,

00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:46.190
you look out the
window, not at--

00:29:46.190 --> 00:29:48.940
and you look at the runway,
not at the these glide-slope

00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:50.680
indicators as you get close.

00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:52.900
So another variation is a PAPI.

00:29:52.900 --> 00:29:55.990
So I like to think, again,
with these memory things,

00:29:55.990 --> 00:29:58.660
VASI I think verticals,
so that's why they're--

00:29:58.660 --> 00:30:00.460
some are on top and
some at the bottom.

00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:02.560
A PAPI is the same thing,
but it's horizontal.

00:30:06.970 --> 00:30:11.090
There also apparently exists a
tri-color visual approach slope

00:30:11.090 --> 00:30:11.660
indicator.

00:30:11.660 --> 00:30:15.720
Almost no one uses this and
you probably will never see it.

00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:16.970
Same with this one.

00:30:16.970 --> 00:30:18.770
But they exist, supposedly.

00:30:22.540 --> 00:30:25.020
OK, so we'll focus on things
you might actually hear.

00:30:25.020 --> 00:30:26.370
So land and hold short.

00:30:28.782 --> 00:30:29.990
So we just talked about this.

00:30:29.990 --> 00:30:33.950
Who remembers what land
and hold short means?

00:30:33.950 --> 00:30:34.660
Yes?

00:30:34.660 --> 00:30:35.760
AUDIENCE: Land, but
don't cross the runway

00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:37.400
until you're given permission.

00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:38.608
TINA SRIVASTRAVA: Absolutely.

00:30:38.608 --> 00:30:41.150
So you can land, but don't
cross the intersecting runway

00:30:41.150 --> 00:30:43.100
unless you're given permission.

00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:46.400
So land and hold short is
something that the air traffic

00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:48.352
controller might ask
you to do, and they

00:30:48.352 --> 00:30:50.810
might be really assertive about
it and they might tell you,

00:30:50.810 --> 00:30:51.905
we have a lot of
traffic here, I need

00:30:51.905 --> 00:30:53.240
you to land and hold short.

00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:54.830
Regardless of how
assertively they

00:30:54.830 --> 00:30:57.950
tell you that, you're the pilot
in command and you can just--

00:30:57.950 --> 00:31:01.380
you can just say no and
they have to deal with it.

00:31:01.380 --> 00:31:04.130
So especially if
you're a new pilot,

00:31:04.130 --> 00:31:06.740
you're actually not
allowed to accept a land

00:31:06.740 --> 00:31:09.223
and hold short instruction
as a student pilot.

00:31:09.223 --> 00:31:10.640
So if you're a
student pilot, they

00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:13.050
tell you to land and hold
short, you have to say no.

00:31:13.050 --> 00:31:15.860
And the reason is that you
may not be very good at it

00:31:15.860 --> 00:31:18.830
and you might take more runway
than you thought you were

00:31:18.830 --> 00:31:20.790
going to take in order to land.

00:31:20.790 --> 00:31:23.060
Do you have a question?

00:31:23.060 --> 00:31:23.560
No?

00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:24.440
OK.

00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:26.330
And yeah.

00:31:26.330 --> 00:31:28.610
So you also have to have
proper visibility in order

00:31:28.610 --> 00:31:33.290
to accept this type of
restriction as well.

00:31:33.290 --> 00:31:33.790
Yes?

00:31:33.790 --> 00:31:35.332
AUDIENCE: What
happens if you accept?

00:31:35.332 --> 00:31:37.883
Or do you have to go around?

00:31:37.883 --> 00:31:40.300
TINA SRIVASTRAVA: It's OK to
accept you have to go around,

00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:42.000
you just have to--

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.910
you do what's safe for
you first, for your plane,

00:31:44.910 --> 00:31:48.720
and then you communicate that as
quickly as possible to the air

00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:49.830
traffic controller.

00:31:49.830 --> 00:31:51.480
If you-- as soon as
you know that you

00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:53.190
might have to go
around, you need

00:31:53.190 --> 00:31:54.720
to communicate that
so that they can

00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:57.020
try to make sure that
there's no incident

00:31:57.020 --> 00:31:58.020
with the other aircraft.

00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:03.070
But generally, you don't
want to accept a land

00:32:03.070 --> 00:32:04.630
and hold short
unless you're very

00:32:04.630 --> 00:32:06.363
comfortable with
the environment,

00:32:06.363 --> 00:32:07.780
it's a good weather
condition, you

00:32:07.780 --> 00:32:09.370
have a good handle
of your aircraft,

00:32:09.370 --> 00:32:11.590
your air speed's doing
what you want it to do,

00:32:11.590 --> 00:32:13.590
and you feel comfortable
that you could actually

00:32:13.590 --> 00:32:14.620
follow that guidance.

00:32:14.620 --> 00:32:16.493
But of course, at
the end of the day,

00:32:16.493 --> 00:32:18.160
you're the pilot in
command, and if it's

00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:21.460
going to be unsafe to you and
your aircraft to make a landing

00:32:21.460 --> 00:32:23.740
and you have to do a
go-around, you have to do that,

00:32:23.740 --> 00:32:26.032
and you just need to communicate
as quickly as possible

00:32:26.032 --> 00:32:29.790
to the air traffic controller.

00:32:29.790 --> 00:32:32.250
So there's some light signals.

00:32:32.250 --> 00:32:35.700
Again, no one's probably ever
encountered this in real life,

00:32:35.700 --> 00:32:38.250
but supposedly if your
radio dies and you

00:32:38.250 --> 00:32:41.572
need to communicate with the
tower, they have this light gun

00:32:41.572 --> 00:32:43.530
and they can communicate
a bunch of information

00:32:43.530 --> 00:32:45.150
to you via these signals.

00:32:45.150 --> 00:32:47.370
They're great candidates
for FAA questions,

00:32:47.370 --> 00:32:51.300
they're unlikely to be used in
reality, and a lot of people

00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:53.982
have their checklist.

00:32:53.982 --> 00:32:55.440
It has like a page
in the back that

00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:58.410
has this because it's so
rare, people don't usually

00:32:58.410 --> 00:33:01.210
commit this to memory.

00:33:01.210 --> 00:33:04.080
So here's some more resources
for you to refer to.

00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:08.058
All right, are
there any questions?

00:33:08.058 --> 00:33:10.517
PHILIP GREENSPUN: I don't you
have questions in conjunction

00:33:10.517 --> 00:33:11.520
with a coffee break.

00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:11.880
TINA SRIVASTRAVA: All right.

00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:12.510
So it's--

00:33:12.510 --> 00:33:14.280
PHILIP GREENSPUN: I'm
up next, and I figured--

00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:16.363
I already saw people
sleeping through my last one,

00:33:16.363 --> 00:33:18.763
so I decided to get
two boxes of coffee.

00:33:18.763 --> 00:33:19.930
TINA SRIVASTRAVA: All right.

00:33:19.930 --> 00:33:24.220
It's 2:15, so we'll
start up again at 2:30.

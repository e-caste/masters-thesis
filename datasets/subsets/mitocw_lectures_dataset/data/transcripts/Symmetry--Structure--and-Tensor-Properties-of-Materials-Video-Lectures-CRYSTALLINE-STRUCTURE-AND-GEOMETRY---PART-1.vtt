00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:08.850
PROFESSOR: Good afternoon
and welcome back.

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:11.630
I'm glad you all came back
even though there was a

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:15.790
problem in finding a seat
for every one last time.

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:21.860
I would like you to turn in the
problem set if you've been

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:22.785
able to do it.

00:00:22.785 --> 00:00:25.960
If you haven't been able to do
it, that's no great problem,

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.260
but I hope you find
it mildly amusing.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.350
I have given that problem set
out a couple of times over the

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:39.930
years, and I can recall one very
pale student who appeared

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.400
at my door the next morning
saying it's the first problem

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.380
set, you've only talked an
hour and I can't do it.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.940
And then there was another group
of three who formed a

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:55.350
consortium to attempt to solve
the code using a computer.

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.800
They didn't get very
far either.

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.230
This is an interesting sort of
problem because it requires

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.269
you to think in a slightly
different direction than

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:07.190
you're accustomed to thinking,
and therefore it's a little

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:08.700
bit amusing.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.020
This is not my creation, it
came from a book by a man

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.730
named Polya, the title of the
book is Mathematics and

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:17.640
Plausible Reasoning.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.360
And he gives this as an example
of a problem that can

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.780
be solved only if
you think in a

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.100
slightly different direction.

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.450
I'll give you another example
of a problem from his book.

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.520
Suppose, not that the problem
arises in this era when you do

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.550
all of your graphics on a
computer console, but suppose

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.160
you had to, in solving a problem
in short notice, draw

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:47.800
a circle that had a diameter
of 4 inches.

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.300
And you went looking for your
pair of compasses which you

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.820
never use very often, and when
you found them, they were

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.380
rusted solid, and they
were open to a

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.300
distance of 5 inches.

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:02.370
OK, so there's the problem.

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:04.840
You have a pair of compasses
that can only draw a circle

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.180
that's 5 inches in diameter, you
must draw a circle that's

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:11.130
4 inches in diameter.

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.890
What sort of construction, what
sort of mapping out of

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.650
arcs that you connected together
could you do to

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.910
create the circle of
smaller diameter?

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.160
Anybody have an idea?

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.960
It seems impossible
doesn't it?

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:33.600
Well suppose you got yourself
a little block of wood that

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:39.480
had a height that was equal to
the square root of 5 squared

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.460
minus 4 squared.

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:45.170
And so you have one end of the
compass is up on top of the

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.580
block of wood the other end of
the compass traces out a

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.450
circle that has a smaller
diameter.

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:53.960
It's fairly obvious.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.530
But what you have to do is to
think of a problem that has

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.630
poked your nose into
two-dimensions and think of it

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.380
in terms of a three-dimensional
problem, and

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:03.830
then the answer is easy.

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:06.140
So that was the sort of thought
provoking thing that

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.870
Polya presented in one
portion of this book.

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.200
OK, if you enjoyed that problem,
I have another one

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.540
for you in a similar vein.

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.830
And perhaps you'll enjoy
this one as well.

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:22.700
So while I'm talking, let me
pass this around, I think

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:23.950
there's enough for everyone.

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:33.580
Last time I got so caught up
with the displaying the heft

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:37.150
of the International Tables for
X-Ray Crystallography that

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.320
I forgot to mention entirely
that there is another text

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.510
that we will use in the class.

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:47.070
And this we will not need until
halfway through the

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:51.450
semester, and therefore I did
not feel terribly remiss in

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:52.600
not mentioning it.

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:59.570
It's a book by somebody named
Nye, and it's called the

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:02.530
Physical Properties
of Crystals.

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:23.680
And this is published by Oxford
University Press and

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:37.050
the publication date of the
original addition was in 1967.

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:42.760
This is a book that is really,
I don't think I'm being

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:46.590
extravagant in calling
it a classic.

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:48.550
It is a beautifully
written book.

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:53.340
The first 2/3 of it deal
systematically with tensor

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:58.130
properties, the particular sort
of mathematics that is

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:01.450
used to set them up,
transformation of axes, and

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:04.930
then looks at specific physical
properties and

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:09.780
numbers that have to be
described in terms of tensors.

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:14.210
This is actually the third
book in a sequence.

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:23.200
It was a book by Wooster that
covered things very similarly,

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:29.620
but the notation that was used
for the tensors was not the

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:31.350
modern current notation.

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:43.790
And then the subject started in
the form of a third book,

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:45.380
Woldemar Voigt.

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:54.060
And the title of this book is
Lehrbuch der Kristallphysik.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.820
And this was published
back in 1910.

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:16.970
This is the first time
anybody had anything

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:19.926
to say on the matter.

00:06:19.926 --> 00:06:24.460
It in fact is a big fat book
that contains some topics that

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:27.030
are not covered in
Wooster and Nye.

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:31.940
Nye's book is beautifully
written.

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:36.410
The first 2/3 of it concerns
tensor formalism and the last

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:39.580
1/3, which we will not touch
at all, deals with

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:42.470
thermodynamic relations between
different properties

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:45.330
that are represented
by tensors.

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:52.120
So I don't recommend you go out
and buy this book until

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:54.680
you determine whether or not you
need it because I'll try

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:57.180
to make the lectures
self-contained and I'll have

00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:59.570
lots of notes and handouts.

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:03.610
The problem with Nye's book, and
any book that is intensely

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:09.000
mathematical, is that you can't
jump in on page 73 to

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.330
find the answer to a
specific question.

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:14.150
Because when you go there, it
will say as we showed back in

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:16.540
Chapter 4, now what is
he talking about?

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:20.520
So you go back to Chapter 4, and
Chapter 4 says, starting

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:23.720
with our definition of Chapter
2, and you have to go back and

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:24.630
read Chapter 2.

00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:27.920
So it's awfully hard to pick
something out to answer a

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:28.810
specific question.

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:32.230
You have to really go all
the way through it.

00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:36.200
The good news is that
Nye's book has been

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:38.960
published in paperback.

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:42.650
And it is available at the
COOP and paperback means

00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:46.000
cheap, cheap, or relatively
inexpensive.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.230
No books are really
cheap these days.

00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:53.000
So we will cover material that's
in there, we'll have a

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.950
slightly different emphasis,
but the notation and the

00:07:55.950 --> 00:08:01.380
general mathematics that's
involved is in Nye's book.

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:05.240
The second thing that I
mentioned last time is that

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:10.510
there is a very, very nice and
thorough and geometric

00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:12.950
treatment of crystal symmetry.

00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:14.390
And I said that's
the good news.

00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:18.470
The bad news is that it's out of
print, so I promised, what

00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:21.260
a guy, that I give you
a Xerox copy of the

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:22.900
first half of the book.

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:25.630
So here is the text that
we'll use in the

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:26.880
first part of the term.

00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:37.260
I included at the beginning, the
table of contents, so you

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:42.840
can see each other topics that
are covered in the book.

00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:52.190
We will not go through all of
the material that's covered.

00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:59.420
There are a lot of different
symmetries to be derived, and

00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:02.610
it turns out that if you get the
general idea and you can

00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:06.940
summarize the results, there's
no need to derive every single

00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:09.560
one of them.

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:12.840
It's nice to know that there's a
place where you can find out

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:16.105
how it is done if you really
have a particular question.

00:09:16.105 --> 00:09:19.940
Did everybody get a copy or are
there a few who did not?

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:23.540
I made extras, OK, nobody
in need of one, great.

00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:36.250
OK, let me now start with a
general rhetorical question.

00:09:36.250 --> 00:09:40.740
Crystallography, as we mentioned
last time, is the

00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:42.740
geometry of crystals.

00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:46.100
It's the geometry of patterns
and the sorts of symmetries

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:48.280
that are in those patterns.

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:50.950
Now you might ask yourself,
why should I as a material

00:09:50.950 --> 00:09:53.940
scientist or a physical
scientist of some sort, worry

00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:55.070
about this stuff?

00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:58.810
I'm not training to be a
wallpaper designer, I'm going

00:09:58.810 --> 00:10:00.040
to do physical things.

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:04.250
I'm going to heat things and
measure properties, and that

00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:06.290
sort of thing.

00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:11.550
Well there are at least three
answers to that question.

00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:15.330
First of all, whether you like
it or not, the arcane language

00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:17.830
of symmetry is the
language that's

00:10:17.830 --> 00:10:20.620
used to describe crystals.

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:24.460
It's the language that's used
to describe structures.

00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:27.000
The normal thing that you do
when you're trying to describe

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.410
verbally a ball and pin model of
the geometrical arrangement

00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:33.940
of atoms in a crystal is to say
the red balls are at the

00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:37.410
corners of the cube, the green
balls are in the middle of the

00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:41.520
edges, and the chartreuse balls
are sort of tucked up

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:45.210
inside one of the corners, but
slightly closer to 1 face than

00:10:45.210 --> 00:10:48.090
to the other 2 faces.

00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:51.840
The point I'm trying to make is
that is a language that has

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:54.350
limited utility.

00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:58.340
It deals, it's capable of
dealing only with the simplest

00:10:58.340 --> 00:11:00.560
sort of atomic configurations.

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:03.580
So there is a general language
based on symmetry theory,

00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:08.270
based on group theory, that is
universally used to describe

00:11:08.270 --> 00:11:10.060
atomic arrangements.

00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:13.300
So instead of saying red balls
at the corners of the cube and

00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:17.400
green balls in the middle of
the faces, I can say space

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:26.600
group 4 over m3 bar 2 over m,
atom a in position for b, m3m,

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:32.090
atom b in position for c, m3m.

00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:34.100
That's what rock salt it.

00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:38.400
And that is the way, not only
it, but especially more

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:42.540
complicated structural
arrangements are described in

00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:44.210
the literature.

00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:46.780
So this is the language of
describing such arrangements.

00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:51.640
And finally, sooner or later,
I bet you that every one of

00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:55.950
you will be involved with some
crystalline material, and the

00:11:55.950 --> 00:12:00.590
first question you will answer
is what is its structure, what

00:12:00.590 --> 00:12:01.870
is the atomic arrangement.

00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:04.050
That's where properties start.

00:12:04.050 --> 00:12:09.080
And you'll go a book or a set
of volumes that describe

00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:10.530
structural data.

00:12:10.530 --> 00:12:14.020
There's a big long compendium of
books that fill about that

00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:17.520
much of a bookshelf which are
called structure reports.

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:22.720
They started a number of years
ago to compile all of the

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:24.970
structures that had been
determined within a given

00:12:24.970 --> 00:12:26.290
calendar year.

00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:29.710
They did a pretty good job
of staying caught up

00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:32.680
back in 1915 and 1920.

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:37.260
And then as it became easier to
obtain such results, partly

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:42.730
due to the advent of rapid large
computers, they fell

00:12:42.730 --> 00:12:45.270
further and further behind and
I think now they are about 5

00:12:45.270 --> 00:12:45.970
or 10 miles--

00:12:45.970 --> 00:12:49.350
5 or 10 years, miles as well.

00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:54.400
But this is one of the places
to go to look up, without

00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:57.080
going to the original
literature, whether the

00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:59.260
material that you're interested
in has had its

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:02.270
atomic arrangement determined.

00:13:02.270 --> 00:13:04.600
When you go there you're going
to find the atomic

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:08.140
arrangement, not in terms of red
balls at one position on

00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:10.690
the cell, but you're going to
find it in terms of the

00:13:10.690 --> 00:13:12.590
language of symmetry theory.

00:13:12.590 --> 00:13:15.370
So one of the things I hope
you'll be able to do by the

00:13:15.370 --> 00:13:18.860
time we finish this time
together, is to be able to go

00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:22.070
to such literature and know
exactly what to do and where

00:13:22.070 --> 00:13:25.190
to go to reconstruct
the geometrical

00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:26.440
arrangement of the atoms.

00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:32.880
OK, so hopefully you're at least
mildly convinced that

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:37.410
this exercise is going
to be worthwhile.

00:13:37.410 --> 00:13:40.800
Before we continue where we left
off last time, I would

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:47.340
like to say a little bit about
the language in which these

00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:50.490
geometries are described.

00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:54.090
And we mentioned last time
without thoroughly

00:13:54.090 --> 00:13:58.130
demonstrating why that in a
3-dimensional space there are

00:13:58.130 --> 00:14:01.410
4 basically different
kinds of operations.

00:14:01.410 --> 00:14:06.430
And one of these is something
that all crystals must by

00:14:06.430 --> 00:14:10.690
definition display, and this
is the operation of

00:14:10.690 --> 00:14:13.070
translation.

00:14:13.070 --> 00:14:17.310
Analytically it can be described
as a mapping in

00:14:17.310 --> 00:14:22.500
which every coordinate in a
space xyz is mapped to a

00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:27.460
location x plus some constant,
y plus some constant, z plus

00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:28.870
some constant.

00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:32.850
And if you do the operation
again, this would go to a

00:14:32.850 --> 00:14:38.620
location x plus 2a y
plus 2b, z plus 2c.

00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:46.430
A feature of translation that
is unique to this particular

00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:51.390
symmetry transformation is
that it has no origin.

00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:55.700
If I have a pair of motifs
that are related by

00:14:55.700 --> 00:15:01.290
translation, we could think of
them as being related by a

00:15:01.290 --> 00:15:04.570
vector, magnitude and direction,
that takes this

00:15:04.570 --> 00:15:06.970
motif and moves it
to this location.

00:15:06.970 --> 00:15:10.130
We said that more generally we
should view these operations,

00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:13.900
not just acting on one little
domain and space, but acting

00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:14.980
on everything.

00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:21.360
So this implies that there be a
infinite chain of motifs if

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:24.340
the operation of translation
is to be present.

00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:27.740
Because only that infinite,
doubly infinite string is

00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:32.100
consistent with all of space
being mapped into itself.

00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:34.900
Like any vector, there's
no unique origin.

00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:37.910
You could say it extends from
here to here, or from here to

00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:43.720
here, or any other choice of
translation, provided the

00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:49.140
direction and the magnitude are
the same in every choice.

00:15:49.140 --> 00:15:56.110
As a result, it's not really
possible to specify the locus

00:15:56.110 --> 00:15:57.495
of this particular operation.

00:15:57.495 --> 00:15:59.310
It has magnitude and direction,

00:15:59.310 --> 00:16:00.875
but no unique origin.

00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:08.480
What we can do through a
very neat device is to

00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:19.130
nevertheless, take some
reference point and have each

00:16:19.130 --> 00:16:22.830
of these reference points
separated by T, and have each

00:16:22.830 --> 00:16:27.470
motif lurking off in space in
exactly the same location and

00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:30.650
distance from this point
that we've constructed.

00:16:30.650 --> 00:16:33.640
And this array of abstractions,
so these

00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:37.210
geometrical abstractions, these
points, are what are

00:16:37.210 --> 00:16:48.550
called lattice points, and they
are a very neat summary

00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:52.150
of the translational periodicity
of the crystal.

00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:57.030
It is absolutely essential not
to mix up these lattice points

00:16:57.030 --> 00:17:00.910
which are a construct that we
have created, and the atoms

00:17:00.910 --> 00:17:04.230
themselves that are present
in a crystal.

00:17:04.230 --> 00:17:07.200
The atoms are atoms and they're
not necessarily the

00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:08.520
lattice points.

00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:11.470
Another way of saying that not
all atoms of the same chemical

00:17:11.470 --> 00:17:14.440
species need be translation
equivalent.

00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:18.650
We'll see some examples of this
later on, so do not mix

00:17:18.650 --> 00:17:21.310
up the atoms and the
lattice points.

00:17:21.310 --> 00:17:25.339
When I talk about the sodium
chloride lattice, I mean an

00:17:25.339 --> 00:17:31.430
array of points in space that
are located at the corners of

00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:34.510
a cube and in the middle of
the faces of the cube.

00:17:34.510 --> 00:17:37.860
If I talk about the arrangement
of sodium ions and

00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:41.930
chlorine ions, that is the
sodium chloride structure and

00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:45.160
not the sodium chloride
lattice.

00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:48.190
And then last time I apologized
for usage so as not

00:17:48.190 --> 00:17:50.160
to appear hypocritical.

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:53.730
Everybody talks about lattice
vibration, lattice energy,

00:17:53.730 --> 00:17:56.190
lattice dynamics, and
so on, but that's a

00:17:56.190 --> 00:17:57.650
misuse of the term.

00:17:57.650 --> 00:18:01.100
But nevertheless, it is much
more musical than saying

00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:03.390
structure energy, structure
vibration.

00:18:03.390 --> 00:18:09.150
So we'll go on misusing the
term lattice I'm afraid.

00:18:09.150 --> 00:18:12.420
OK, let's look at another
operation.

00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:15.860
Here we change the sense
of no coordinate.

00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:21.570
Let's next look at an operation
that might take xyz,

00:18:21.570 --> 00:18:25.838
and map it into minus xyz.

00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:33.520
This would be a situation where
if I set up a coordinate

00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:41.900
system, here's x, here's
y, here's z.

00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:46.170
What I've done is to take an
object that sits off here, at

00:18:46.170 --> 00:18:51.260
a coordinate plus x, and I've
changed the sign of x so that

00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:53.725
this object now sits off here.

00:18:59.410 --> 00:19:04.020
This is exactly what happens
when I take something and

00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:07.010
reflect it in a mirror.

00:19:07.010 --> 00:19:10.270
And if that's not immediately
obvious, it just so happens,

00:19:10.270 --> 00:19:12.170
not at all by accident,
I brought

00:19:12.170 --> 00:19:15.280
along with me a mirror.

00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:20.590
OK, here is one hand, and if you
look in the mirror, there

00:19:20.590 --> 00:19:21.480
is the other hand.

00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:26.410
It's the same distance behind
the plane of the mirror, two

00:19:26.410 --> 00:19:30.230
coordinates have been
left unchanged.

00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:33.620
The two coordinates within the
plane of the mirror, if that

00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:36.220
is my choice of the reference
system, and one of them has

00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:38.670
been reversed.

00:19:38.670 --> 00:19:42.650
Now I'll take the second motif
out of the geometric

00:19:42.650 --> 00:19:45.800
construct, and I'd like to point
out one very curious

00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:49.220
feature of the pair of motifs
that's generated by this

00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:51.110
transformation.

00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:54.820
They're both the same
thing, clearly.

00:19:54.820 --> 00:19:59.820
But no matter how I try, I
cannot move one so that it

00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:02.740
coincides with the other.

00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:06.100
And we intuitively appreciate
this difference by saying we

00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:08.850
actually use our hands
by analogy.

00:20:08.850 --> 00:20:14.930
We say one is left-handed and
one is right-handed, and they

00:20:14.930 --> 00:20:16.380
are not congruent.

00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:19.740
The fancy name that's used to
describe this relation is to

00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:21.420
say that they are
enantiomorph.

00:20:27.770 --> 00:20:31.740
Another term that's used,
particularly in chemistry, is

00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:33.470
to say that they are chiral.

00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:41.750
Which one is the left-handed
one, which is a

00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:44.150
right-handed one?

00:20:44.150 --> 00:20:46.620
This is what I call my left
hand, this is what I call my

00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:47.230
right hand.

00:20:47.230 --> 00:20:52.010
But can we distinguish them
physically, any other way?

00:20:52.010 --> 00:20:57.040
No, these are terms that have
come in to regular use in both

00:20:57.040 --> 00:21:01.800
our everyday language and also
in science because we use our

00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:07.620
hands instinctively as readily
available examples of

00:21:07.620 --> 00:21:12.410
enantiomorphs, readily at hand,
I might say to almost

00:21:12.410 --> 00:21:15.280
make a pun.

00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:20.690
One of the really brilliant
figures in physics was a man

00:21:20.690 --> 00:21:22.790
named Richard Feynman.

00:21:22.790 --> 00:21:28.160
Recently deceased, Feynman gave
a very famous series of

00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:31.220
lectures on science at
Cornell University.

00:21:31.220 --> 00:21:35.640
And he has one entire vector
that was devoted to the

00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:39.600
difference between
right and left.

00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:43.220
And he comes up with a funny
story, he pretends that the

00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:46.750
hero of the story is someone
who's trying to communicate

00:21:46.750 --> 00:21:51.540
with beings in outer space and
suddenly he gets lucky and he

00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:54.130
gets a response to
his message.

00:21:54.130 --> 00:21:56.830
And they work out a way to
communicate and eventually

00:21:56.830 --> 00:22:02.100
they try to describe each other
to the other individual.

00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:03.390
Well what they look like?

00:22:03.390 --> 00:22:08.780
Well we're bipedal, and we have
two organs related by

00:22:08.780 --> 00:22:12.340
reflection that let us sense
light and form images.

00:22:12.340 --> 00:22:15.940
And we have an aperture through
which we ingest things

00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:17.820
that can be metabolized.

00:22:17.820 --> 00:22:21.750
And our circulation and body
works because we have a pump

00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:24.790
on the left hand side
that circulates

00:22:24.790 --> 00:22:26.100
fluids through our--

00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:29.900
wait, I don't understand,
what's left?

00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:34.590
So then there follows along this
course on how to define

00:22:34.590 --> 00:22:37.690
left in an absolute sense.

00:22:37.690 --> 00:22:40.620
How do you describe to someone
what makes your left hand

00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:43.450
left, and your right hand
right without being

00:22:43.450 --> 00:22:45.080
anthropomorphic about it.

00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:48.220
So it goes on and on and on
and he gets into physical

00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:49.810
phenomena which are
objective and

00:22:49.810 --> 00:22:51.530
independent of a human being.

00:22:51.530 --> 00:22:58.360
And finally he comes to the
anisotropic emission beta

00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:01.050
particles in radioactive
decay.

00:23:01.050 --> 00:23:04.360
And that depends on direction
relative to the magnetic

00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:07.350
moment and that defines
an absolute sense

00:23:07.350 --> 00:23:08.880
of right and left.

00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:11.460
So that's something physical,
it doesn't depend on the

00:23:11.460 --> 00:23:13.500
nature of the human being.

00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:17.970
And then Feynman wraps up his
story by saying, if finally

00:23:17.970 --> 00:23:22.140
our extraterrestrial being
travels to space, gets out of

00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:25.320
his spaceship and he walks
forward to greet you and you

00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:28.810
put out your right hand, and he
puts out his left hand, get

00:23:28.810 --> 00:23:32.490
out of their fast because it
means he is made out of

00:23:32.490 --> 00:23:34.710
anti-matter.

00:23:34.710 --> 00:23:38.810
And nuclei of matter in this
anisotropic emission of data

00:23:38.810 --> 00:23:42.020
rays shoot out the beta
particle in one sense,

00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:44.220
anti-matter shoots out
the beta particle

00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:48.160
in the chiral sense.

00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:53.640
So it's a cute little story that
emphasizes the problem in

00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:57.700
defining absolutely
left from right.

00:23:57.700 --> 00:23:59.930
But they're of opposite
handedness that we can say.

00:24:06.540 --> 00:24:15.320
Mirrors are interesting things
and I brought along a couple

00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:24.000
of mirrors and they have very,
very peculiar characteristics.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:28.260
And I would invite you to come
up and look at these in

00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:30.900
private because if I hold them
up in front of you, you're not

00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:33.670
going to be able to see what I'm
doing at all, although I

00:24:33.670 --> 00:24:37.440
kid myself that you can, and
I walk around and show

00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:38.800
you what I'm doing.

00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:42.750
Here is something scientific,
it's a chemical compound

00:24:42.750 --> 00:24:45.890
carbon dioxide, and--

00:24:55.850 --> 00:25:01.830
OK, and if I hand this down you
can see carbon dioxide in

00:25:01.830 --> 00:25:03.646
the mirror.

00:25:03.646 --> 00:25:06.930
Can you see that?

00:25:06.930 --> 00:25:08.850
Uh oh, it's not reflecting--

00:25:08.850 --> 00:25:10.560
sorry, I didn't turn it on.

00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:16.960
Now I think we can get it.

00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:19.200
And is it working now?

00:25:32.580 --> 00:25:35.720
OK, now it's working.

00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:40.200
You can see why this is a very
special kind of mirror because

00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:45.180
it reflects only red letters
and it leaves the black

00:25:45.180 --> 00:25:46.430
letters unchanged.

00:25:56.342 --> 00:25:58.460
You're going to have to come
up, I see some of you

00:25:58.460 --> 00:26:00.450
straining your necks, you'll
have to come up and look at

00:26:00.450 --> 00:26:01.860
that in person.

00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:07.160
But the black letters are
completely unchanged, the red

00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:09.130
letters are reflected
into letters

00:26:09.130 --> 00:26:12.140
of an opposite chirality.

00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:16.290
It's a very special
kind of mirror.

00:26:16.290 --> 00:26:20.010
I've got another kind of
mirror that works in a

00:26:20.010 --> 00:26:21.260
different way.

00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:29.450
Where Is my other
piece of paper?

00:26:29.450 --> 00:26:30.700
OK.

00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:42.620
This is an interesting mirror
because it reflects only male

00:26:42.620 --> 00:26:48.300
names are not female names.

00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:51.880
This was a very topical sort of
mirror a few years ago when

00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:52.840
there was a lawsuit.

00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:56.210
There was a college down South
called the Citadel which would

00:26:56.210 --> 00:27:01.380
only admit male applicants and
not female applicants.

00:27:01.380 --> 00:27:03.830
So I claim that this was a
mirror that I got from the

00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:09.590
Citadel because it doesn't
change the male names, but

00:27:09.590 --> 00:27:15.160
does change, does reject or
reflect, female names.

00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:18.480
So you can play with this
during our break.

00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:23.120
But if I look at myself
in a mirror, I

00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:25.870
take a look at myself.

00:27:25.870 --> 00:27:29.520
If I wink my left eye, the
in there winks his

00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:32.880
right eye back at me.

00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:36.540
So I'm not really seeing myself,
what I'm seeing is my

00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:38.390
enantiomorph.

00:27:38.390 --> 00:27:40.620
Doesn't that shake you up?

00:27:40.620 --> 00:27:45.330
You have never ever seen
yourself in exactly the same

00:27:45.330 --> 00:27:49.510
way as other people see you.

00:27:49.510 --> 00:27:51.740
You are only familiar with
your enantiomorph.

00:27:56.020 --> 00:27:57.330
Does that make a difference?

00:27:57.330 --> 00:27:59.450
Well I'll bring in something
that I put together and I

00:27:59.450 --> 00:28:01.850
couldn't put my hands on.

00:28:01.850 --> 00:28:06.470
We are very, very sensitive to
the symmetry in our faces.

00:28:06.470 --> 00:28:09.060
And if they are reflected left
to right, you surely are going

00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:11.320
to look different to
the other person.

00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:14.780
And the way to see that is to
take a photograph of somebody

00:28:14.780 --> 00:28:17.940
and cut it down the middle,
and put the two different

00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:20.750
sides reflected left to right.

00:28:20.750 --> 00:28:24.460
And the expression on the
person's face, and the general

00:28:24.460 --> 00:28:29.670
spirit that that image conveys
is entirely different if you

00:28:29.670 --> 00:28:33.020
use the one half of the face
reflected left to right, and

00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:36.040
the other half reflected
left to right.

00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:39.810
So think of this, when you look
in the mirror, you see

00:28:39.810 --> 00:28:44.260
your enantiomorph and other
people see you differently.

00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:46.070
Let me ask you to scratch
your head now.

00:28:46.070 --> 00:28:49.640
Is there any time when, in point
of fact, you may have

00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:54.930
seen yourself without being
reflected into the

00:28:54.930 --> 00:28:55.490
enantiomorph?

00:28:55.490 --> 00:28:55.870
Yeah.

00:28:55.870 --> 00:28:57.430
AUDIENCE: Picture?

00:28:57.430 --> 00:28:57.710
PROFESSOR: Absolutely.

00:28:57.710 --> 00:29:01.170
A Photograph or a TV monitor.

00:29:01.170 --> 00:29:06.220
When you look at a picture on
television, you can read all

00:29:06.220 --> 00:29:09.540
the signs, and they didn't
make up special signs in

00:29:09.540 --> 00:29:11.290
reflection so that they'd
look right when they

00:29:11.290 --> 00:29:12.400
photographed you.

00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:15.760
So photography or a
video camera does

00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:18.120
not change the chirality.

00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:22.920
But I've got another way in
which I can see myself in the

00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:24.650
exact same chirality.

00:29:24.650 --> 00:29:26.950
And this I can't really
convince you of,

00:29:26.950 --> 00:29:28.200
you'll have to try it.

00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:32.730
If I put two mirrors together at
90 degrees, and then adjust

00:29:32.730 --> 00:29:37.450
them so that I am looking
right the point of

00:29:37.450 --> 00:29:42.690
intersection so that my two
images coincide, then I see

00:29:42.690 --> 00:29:46.270
myself in the normal way.

00:29:46.270 --> 00:29:51.130
If I now blink my left eye,
this guy blinks his

00:29:51.130 --> 00:29:53.020
left eye at me too.

00:29:53.020 --> 00:29:56.710
This is really astounding, two
mirrors at 90 degrees, if you

00:29:56.710 --> 00:29:59.260
look at yourself right at their
point of intersection,

00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:03.970
give you a non-chiral
image of yourself.

00:30:03.970 --> 00:30:06.350
So I invite you to come up and
try that, that's truly

00:30:06.350 --> 00:30:07.600
astounding.

00:30:09.550 --> 00:30:12.980
So why should somebody in
material science or chemistry

00:30:12.980 --> 00:30:14.950
care about chirality?

00:30:14.950 --> 00:30:16.270
Does it really make
any difference?

00:30:18.815 --> 00:30:23.350
Let me give you a little
experiment that you can try.

00:30:23.350 --> 00:30:25.840
Suppose you have a little cell
on a couple pieces of

00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:28.950
Polaroid, and the cell has a
glass front and a glass back

00:30:28.950 --> 00:30:31.690
and you fill it with
sugar solution.

00:30:31.690 --> 00:30:35.570
And then you pass a beam of
polarized light through the

00:30:35.570 --> 00:30:41.250
sugar solution, and what happens
is that the sugar

00:30:41.250 --> 00:30:48.240
solution rotates the direction
of polarization in proportion

00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:50.620
to the thickness of solution
at the light is passed

00:30:50.620 --> 00:30:54.690
through, in proportion to the
concentration of sugar.

00:30:54.690 --> 00:30:57.600
The point of polarization
gets rotated.

00:30:57.600 --> 00:31:00.440
Now that's pretty curious,
so you scratch

00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:01.340
your head about that.

00:31:01.340 --> 00:31:03.332
Why does that happen?

00:31:03.332 --> 00:31:05.810
Well, maybe I'd better go
back and try it again.

00:31:05.810 --> 00:31:08.390
And a day or two later, you
go back and you repeat the

00:31:08.390 --> 00:31:09.410
experiment.

00:31:09.410 --> 00:31:16.430
And once again, the point of
polarization rotates, but it

00:31:16.430 --> 00:31:18.620
rotates in the opposite
direction.

00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:27.400
The reason for this is that
if I was not careful in

00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:30.410
cleanliness and there were some
little bugs lurking in

00:31:30.410 --> 00:31:33.440
the corners of that cell and
when they sense the sugar

00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:36.165
solution, they said wow, free
lunch, and they crawled out

00:31:36.165 --> 00:31:37.050
And gobbled it up.

00:31:37.050 --> 00:31:40.650
It turns out, those guys can
gobble up just the sugar of

00:31:40.650 --> 00:31:42.160
one chirality.

00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:45.650
Sugar is a chiral molecule.

00:31:45.650 --> 00:31:50.710
And in fact there is a product
that's called invert sugar and

00:31:50.710 --> 00:31:54.210
this is sugar that is all
of one handedness.

00:31:54.210 --> 00:31:57.520
But everything in the world
around us, everything from

00:31:57.520 --> 00:32:00.980
sugar beats to sugar cane to
other things that make

00:32:00.980 --> 00:32:08.830
sucrose, manufacture sugar of
one chirality, not mixed.

00:32:08.830 --> 00:32:12.880
All chiral molecules that are
produced by living organisms

00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:15.575
are all of the same
kind chirality.

00:32:15.575 --> 00:32:19.910
If we make them synthetically,
there's no reason to favor

00:32:19.910 --> 00:32:23.820
synthesis of one molecule or
the opposite handedness, so

00:32:23.820 --> 00:32:28.830
synthesized molecules are of
equal proportion in the

00:32:28.830 --> 00:32:33.170
left-handed chirality and the
right-hand chirality.

00:32:33.170 --> 00:32:38.130
This means that in the case of
pharmaceuticals at the very

00:32:38.130 --> 00:32:44.030
best, you are going to use only
half of the product that

00:32:44.030 --> 00:32:45.220
you've made.

00:32:45.220 --> 00:32:49.950
There is a pharmaceutical
product that is prescribed for

00:32:49.950 --> 00:32:55.600
attention deficit disorder, this
is called Ritalin, and

00:32:55.600 --> 00:33:00.480
only one chirality of the
Ritalin molecule does

00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:01.610
anything for you.

00:33:01.610 --> 00:33:03.020
The other part is
just metabolized

00:33:03.020 --> 00:33:05.360
and doesn't do anything.

00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:08.990
But there are other much
more sinister cases.

00:33:08.990 --> 00:33:13.750
There was a serious problem
about 20 years ago, primarily

00:33:13.750 --> 00:33:20.670
in Europe, where a particular
pharmaceutical thalidomide was

00:33:20.670 --> 00:33:25.650
prescribed for pregnant women,
it was to act as a sedative.

00:33:25.650 --> 00:33:29.530
Only one chirality of the
molecule did this, the other

00:33:29.530 --> 00:33:34.590
chirality tragically caused
birth defects.

00:33:34.590 --> 00:33:38.980
So you have to be very careful
about the chirality of the

00:33:38.980 --> 00:33:42.630
pharmaceutical molecule
that you synthesize.

00:33:42.630 --> 00:33:45.800
Another example, there is--

00:33:48.340 --> 00:33:50.405
I don't remember
the name of it.

00:33:52.950 --> 00:33:57.095
This is something that
is taken to--

00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:06.990
this is something called
Ethambutal which is used to

00:34:06.990 --> 00:34:09.340
treat tuberculosis.

00:34:09.340 --> 00:34:11.949
Only the molecule of one
handedness does this, the

00:34:11.949 --> 00:34:14.090
other one causes blindness.

00:34:14.090 --> 00:34:16.889
That's really a sinister
and antiomorph.

00:34:16.889 --> 00:34:20.380
Then there's some even
crazier examples.

00:34:20.380 --> 00:34:25.260
Ibuprofen is a chiral molecule,
and this in a most

00:34:25.260 --> 00:34:29.190
remarkable situation is a
molecule which you're body

00:34:29.190 --> 00:34:34.090
converts to the molecule of
the chirality that has the

00:34:34.090 --> 00:34:35.710
intended purpose.

00:34:35.710 --> 00:34:39.800
So here your body is clever
enough to change ibuprofen

00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:43.139
into the molecule which is the
one that you need for its

00:34:43.139 --> 00:34:44.389
pharmaceutical effect.

00:34:46.820 --> 00:34:50.530
OK, so mirrors are interesting
things.

00:34:50.530 --> 00:34:53.979
I would invite you to come up
and play with the special

00:34:53.979 --> 00:34:56.920
mirrors that do strange things
and see yourself

00:34:56.920 --> 00:35:00.770
as others see you.

00:35:00.770 --> 00:35:04.370
And now I would like to continue
on in this discussion

00:35:04.370 --> 00:35:09.710
to mention the ways in which
we can represent a mirror

00:35:09.710 --> 00:35:13.040
plane in a graphic language.

00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:15.390
This is what a mirror plane
does, it changes the sense of

00:35:15.390 --> 00:35:16.600
one coordinate.

00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:20.720
If there is a locus across which
that transformation is

00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:26.240
performed, we would like first
of all, an analytic symbol.

00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:35.310
Some way of indicating the
presence of that particular

00:35:35.310 --> 00:35:40.430
operation in the pattern, and
a mirror is very descriptive

00:35:40.430 --> 00:35:44.360
so the symbol m is used to
represent the presence of a

00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:48.810
mirror plane in a particular
symbol.

00:35:48.810 --> 00:35:55.610
We might want to indicate
a specific operation.

00:35:55.610 --> 00:35:59.480
There are only two operations in
the case of a mirror plane

00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:02.620
reflecting left to right and
reflecting right to left.

00:36:02.620 --> 00:36:05.590
But there are other operations
such as rotation.

00:36:05.590 --> 00:36:10.500
If we have a 16-fold rotation
axis, there is one operation

00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:15.170
that consists of rotating 1/16
of 2 pi, another operation

00:36:15.170 --> 00:36:18.750
that will also leave the space
invariant that's rotating 2/16

00:36:18.750 --> 00:36:20.190
of 2 pi, and so on.

00:36:20.190 --> 00:36:23.080
So an individual operation
is something that we

00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:27.280
will want to designate.

00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:30.960
And for a mirror plane,
something that is used

00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:34.960
commonly in physics is to use
an operation sigma for a

00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:38.150
particular reflection.

00:36:38.150 --> 00:36:42.120
This is not done in Buerger.

00:36:42.120 --> 00:36:48.260
If you get into reading it,
he uses m for both.

00:36:48.260 --> 00:36:53.500
And then finally, it's going to
be convenient when we have

00:36:53.500 --> 00:36:59.550
a pattern before us to use a
geometric symbol to indicate

00:36:59.550 --> 00:37:03.650
in the pattern the locus of
this particular operation.

00:37:03.650 --> 00:37:09.710
And what we use in the case of a
mirror plane is a bold line.

00:37:09.710 --> 00:37:12.700
And that if this were the
pattern and we wanted to

00:37:12.700 --> 00:37:16.280
indicate where the mirror plane
was, or the mirror line

00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:18.830
in 2-dimensions that relates
those two motifs,

00:37:18.830 --> 00:37:20.080
we draw it in thusly.

00:37:24.980 --> 00:37:28.910
We began last time to examine
the properties of rotation,

00:37:28.910 --> 00:37:34.080
but that's another sort of
symmetry and that is a

00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:37.165
rotation which takes place
about a rotation axis.

00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:48.760
The symbol that is used to
represent the collection of

00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:52.550
operations, the analytic symbol,
is based on the fact

00:37:52.550 --> 00:37:58.590
that the angular rotation,
alpha, has to be equal to some

00:37:58.590 --> 00:38:01.020
sub-multiple of 2 pi.

00:38:01.020 --> 00:38:03.200
2 pi over n, where n
is some integer.

00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:12.050
And the reason for that I think
is quite clear, if I

00:38:12.050 --> 00:38:19.860
take a particular motif and
rotate through an angle alpha,

00:38:19.860 --> 00:38:24.220
if I am not rotating by some
sub-multiple of 2 pi, I'll

00:38:24.220 --> 00:38:26.950
just go round and round and
round and I will never get a

00:38:26.950 --> 00:38:33.160
finite set of objects that is
separated from its neighbor by

00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:35.760
the same angular
interval alpha.

00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:38.950
This will only happen if
alpha is an integral

00:38:38.950 --> 00:38:41.220
sub-multiple of 2 pi.

00:38:41.220 --> 00:38:46.170
And the symbol that is used
for the collection of

00:38:46.170 --> 00:38:49.780
operations that is usually
embodied in a rotation axis is

00:38:49.780 --> 00:38:53.520
n, the same n that is
in the denominator.

00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:58.180
The symbol for individual
rotation, so we mentioned last

00:38:58.180 --> 00:39:02.080
time we have to specify the
location of the point about

00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:07.570
which we rotate, and we have
to indicate the angle alpha

00:39:07.570 --> 00:39:09.190
through which we've rotated.

00:39:09.190 --> 00:39:13.890
So A alpha will be an individual
operation, and the

00:39:13.890 --> 00:39:22.010
geometric symbol will be an
n-Gon which has the symmetry

00:39:22.010 --> 00:39:23.500
of the rotation axis.

00:39:23.500 --> 00:39:28.050
So for a sixfold axis we
would use a hexagon.

00:39:28.050 --> 00:39:33.170
For a fivefold axis we will
use a pentagon, for a

00:39:33.170 --> 00:39:37.950
fourfold, a square, for a
threefold, a triangle.

00:39:37.950 --> 00:39:44.350
Now an n-Gon with 180 degree
rotation is a line segment.

00:39:44.350 --> 00:39:46.800
And that would be easily
overlooked and it's not very

00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:50.970
aesthetic, so here we indulge
in a little bit of artistic

00:39:50.970 --> 00:39:55.640
license and fatten out the
middle of the line segment to

00:39:55.640 --> 00:39:58.380
get an oval with pointed ends.

00:39:58.380 --> 00:40:02.090
And that's the symbol
for a twofold axis.

00:40:02.090 --> 00:40:03.990
What about a one-fold axis?

00:40:03.990 --> 00:40:06.910
One-fold axes exist anywhere,
so you can sprinkle them

00:40:06.910 --> 00:40:09.030
around with reckless abandon.

00:40:09.030 --> 00:40:13.170
A one-fold axis has no symmetry
at all, but that is a

00:40:13.170 --> 00:40:16.990
very nice symbol to use for
no symmetry at all.

00:40:16.990 --> 00:40:21.860
So symmetry 1 is the absence
of symmetry.

00:40:21.860 --> 00:40:27.030
So it does come up occasionally
in notation.

00:40:27.030 --> 00:40:32.290
Now if you look at what we've
done so far, we have a

00:40:32.290 --> 00:40:36.040
transformation that changes the
sense of no coordinate.

00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:40.230
We have a transformation that
changes the sense of two

00:40:40.230 --> 00:40:44.470
coordinates, one coordinate, no
coordinate, one coordinate.

00:40:44.470 --> 00:40:48.220
Rotation is interchanging the
sense of two coordinates in a

00:40:48.220 --> 00:40:52.350
plane, and in a 2-dimensional
pattern, that's all there is.

00:40:52.350 --> 00:41:01.660
But for a 3-dimensional space,
we have the option of changing

00:41:01.660 --> 00:41:07.470
the sense of no coordinate, the
sense 1, the sense of 2,

00:41:07.470 --> 00:41:10.750
or change the sense of
all 3 coordinates.

00:41:10.750 --> 00:41:16.310
So if this is x and this is y
and this is z, and up here in

00:41:16.310 --> 00:41:22.640
space lurks my initial motif,
if I change the sense of x,

00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:29.520
the sense of y, and the sense of
z, namely take xyz and map

00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:34.800
it to minus x, minus y, minus z,
what I'm going to do is to

00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:38.510
essentially turn the
object inside out.

00:41:38.510 --> 00:41:44.050
And if my initial one was
right-handed, I will produce a

00:41:44.050 --> 00:41:48.340
chiral object, a left-handed
object.

00:41:48.340 --> 00:41:52.280
This is an operation which
is called inversion.

00:41:55.760 --> 00:41:59.870
In this operation of turning the
object inside out if you

00:41:59.870 --> 00:42:03.050
will, is inverting it
to a new location.

00:42:03.050 --> 00:42:06.490
And this analytically is the
exchange in coordinates

00:42:06.490 --> 00:42:11.330
provided the point of inversion
is at the center.

00:42:11.330 --> 00:42:18.090
The analytic symbol for
inversion is 1 with a bar over

00:42:18.090 --> 00:42:19.830
the top, pronounced 1 bar.

00:42:23.020 --> 00:42:30.660
And I'll have to leave to later
indication of exactly

00:42:30.660 --> 00:42:34.010
where that notation
comes from.

00:42:34.010 --> 00:42:40.810
The individual operation is
also called 1 bar, and the

00:42:40.810 --> 00:42:44.100
geometric symbol that is used to
indicate the location of an

00:42:44.100 --> 00:42:49.840
inversion center is a tiny
little open circle large

00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:53.070
enough so that you don't miss
it, but not so large that it

00:42:53.070 --> 00:42:56.910
might be confused with an atom
in a drawing of an atomic

00:42:56.910 --> 00:42:57.950
arrangement.

00:42:57.950 --> 00:43:02.550
So in this case, we would adorn
our sketch was a little

00:43:02.550 --> 00:43:05.470
circle at the origin if that
was the point through which

00:43:05.470 --> 00:43:06.865
the space was being inverted.

00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:14.870
So that, ladies and gentlemen,
is our basic bag of tricks in

00:43:14.870 --> 00:43:17.430
3-dimensions.

00:43:17.430 --> 00:43:23.410
Let me point out that inversion
can exist in

00:43:23.410 --> 00:43:30.970
3-dimensions only because I have
to have 3 coordinates to

00:43:30.970 --> 00:43:35.570
play with or else I cannot
define the operation.

00:43:35.570 --> 00:43:40.530
Suppose I have a mapping
operation xyz that goes to

00:43:40.530 --> 00:43:46.820
minus x, minus y, minus z, and
I get rid of z to make it

00:43:46.820 --> 00:43:48.560
2-dimensional.

00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:53.220
Then my transformation is xy
going to minus x, minus y and

00:43:53.220 --> 00:43:54.760
that's exactly what a
twofold axis does.

00:44:01.510 --> 00:44:03.990
So inversion, when you throw
out the third coordinate,

00:44:03.990 --> 00:44:07.260
looks like a 180 degree
rotation.

00:44:07.260 --> 00:44:09.990
So you need 3 dimensions
in order to define that

00:44:09.990 --> 00:44:11.240
transformation.

00:44:17.540 --> 00:44:20.000
If we really wanted to go crazy,
we could go on to say

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:23.030
what happens in 4-dimensions?

00:44:26.260 --> 00:44:30.140
There should in principle be
five different operations and

00:44:30.140 --> 00:44:32.250
yes, mathematically you
can define them.

00:44:32.250 --> 00:44:36.060
They're very difficult to draw
because we have to have some

00:44:36.060 --> 00:44:39.290
sort of operation that take
something and pulls it out of

00:44:39.290 --> 00:44:40.640
our 3-dimensional world.

00:44:40.640 --> 00:44:43.310
We have no idea where it went
and then all of sudden, [POP],

00:44:43.310 --> 00:44:46.050
it pops back into our space.

00:44:46.050 --> 00:44:50.000
But mathematically there are
cases when you need a fourth

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:55.230
variable to describe the
symmetry of an arrangement.

00:44:55.230 --> 00:45:00.650
And this generally occurs in
something called a modulated

00:45:00.650 --> 00:45:04.430
structure where there's a
periodic change in some

00:45:04.430 --> 00:45:07.650
variable other than the
atomic positions.

00:45:07.650 --> 00:45:11.670
And let me give you two quick
examples without going into it

00:45:11.670 --> 00:45:12.920
exhaustively.

00:45:15.480 --> 00:45:19.910
One characteristic of an atom
besides its location and its

00:45:19.910 --> 00:45:26.670
atomic mass and things like
that, is perhaps a magnetic

00:45:26.670 --> 00:45:29.780
atom that has a magnetic
moment attached to it.

00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:39.430
There are magnetically
ordered structures.

00:45:39.430 --> 00:45:44.250
One of them looks exactly
like rock salt.

00:45:44.250 --> 00:45:47.010
And I'll draw just the magnetic
cations which sit in

00:45:47.010 --> 00:45:48.280
locations like this.

00:45:50.870 --> 00:45:56.120
And the magnetic moment here
is up, the magnetic moment

00:45:56.120 --> 00:45:59.040
here is up, the magnetic moment
here is down, the

00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:02.190
magnetic moment here is down.

00:46:02.190 --> 00:46:07.810
So what I've drawn here is no
longer the lattice and in

00:46:07.810 --> 00:46:11.570
fact, the lattice constant of
this material looks like a

00:46:11.570 --> 00:46:15.190
rock salt as far as the atomic
positions are concerned, but

00:46:15.190 --> 00:46:21.100
the magnetic moments have to
be continued on in another

00:46:21.100 --> 00:46:28.180
direction and some
extra distance.

00:46:28.180 --> 00:46:32.500
Actually some examples of this
sort of behavior is FeO,

00:46:32.500 --> 00:46:35.110
cobalt oxide, nickel oxide.

00:46:35.110 --> 00:46:38.420
All of these cations are
magnetic, they have magnetic

00:46:38.420 --> 00:46:45.060
moments which are ordered and
the unit cell turns out to be

00:46:45.060 --> 00:46:51.610
when you take magnetic moment
into account, a larger cell, a

00:46:51.610 --> 00:46:53.180
super cell.

00:46:53.180 --> 00:46:57.320
There's a more interesting type
of magnetic structure

00:46:57.320 --> 00:47:03.400
though in which the magnetic
moment is inclined relative to

00:47:03.400 --> 00:47:06.660
some translation in
the structure.

00:47:06.660 --> 00:47:09.730
And the magnetic moments all
lie on the generators of

00:47:09.730 --> 00:47:17.940
cones, but as you walk along
the chain of atoms, the

00:47:17.940 --> 00:47:21.180
orientation of the moment
rotates to different

00:47:21.180 --> 00:47:22.430
orientations.

00:47:26.560 --> 00:47:32.840
There is a family of materials
that are said to have cubicle

00:47:32.840 --> 00:47:45.060
spin structures in which the
periodicity of the march of

00:47:45.060 --> 00:47:49.270
the magnetic moment around the
surface of the cone occurs

00:47:49.270 --> 00:47:52.060
with a period that is in
commensurate with the spacing

00:47:52.060 --> 00:47:54.550
of the chain of atoms.

00:47:54.550 --> 00:47:57.850
So strictly speaking, this
material does not have a

00:47:57.850 --> 00:48:01.570
lattice in this direction, so
it's not a crystal unless you

00:48:01.570 --> 00:48:08.200
use a fourth variable to
describe the periodicity of

00:48:08.200 --> 00:48:09.790
the orientation of the moment.

00:48:09.790 --> 00:48:13.950
And one final one at the risk
of carrying this too far,

00:48:13.950 --> 00:48:17.010
here's a pattern that is based
on a square lattice.

00:48:17.010 --> 00:48:21.490
It has a fourfold axis in it
unless I make the pattern out

00:48:21.490 --> 00:48:25.270
of squares that are black and
white, make a checkerboard.

00:48:33.440 --> 00:48:36.480
This is now no longer a fourfold
axis because I can't

00:48:36.480 --> 00:48:39.740
rotate 90 degrees and leave
the pattern invariant.

00:48:39.740 --> 00:48:42.280
So this is an example of
something called a black-white

00:48:42.280 --> 00:48:44.590
symmetry, or a color symmetry.

00:48:44.590 --> 00:48:50.610
And it requires more than just
4 operations to describe the

00:48:50.610 --> 00:48:52.670
relation between one
motif and another.

00:48:52.670 --> 00:48:55.810
We need a fourth operation,
switching of a color from

00:48:55.810 --> 00:48:59.030
black to white, or switching it
from white to black, that's

00:48:59.030 --> 00:49:00.210
a forth operation.

00:49:00.210 --> 00:49:02.750
Again, within the confines
of a pattern that

00:49:02.750 --> 00:49:03.820
exists in our space.

00:49:03.820 --> 00:49:04.317
Yes?

00:49:04.317 --> 00:49:06.429
AUDIENCE: Does that actually
have-- so you're saying it

00:49:06.429 --> 00:49:08.520
doesn't add value to
the [INAUDIBLE]?

00:49:08.520 --> 00:49:11.950
PROFESSOR: I did say no
rotational symmetry if it has

00:49:11.950 --> 00:49:16.940
a fourfold axis here but this
used to be a fourfold axis,

00:49:16.940 --> 00:49:21.430
and that now changes into
a twofold axis.

00:49:21.430 --> 00:49:24.470
And then I have the problem of
describing how this square is

00:49:24.470 --> 00:49:28.710
a square exactly like this
square except for its color.

00:49:28.710 --> 00:49:32.120
So I need then an operation
which rotates 90 degrees and

00:49:32.120 --> 00:49:34.070
switches from white to black.

00:49:34.070 --> 00:49:37.190
And then rotates 90 degrees
again and switches

00:49:37.190 --> 00:49:40.130
from black to white.

00:49:40.130 --> 00:49:45.970
So there's a fifth operation,
a color change that is

00:49:45.970 --> 00:49:49.990
necessary in a 3-dimensional
space or a forth operation, a

00:49:49.990 --> 00:49:51.480
color change in a 2-dimensional

00:49:51.480 --> 00:49:53.820
checkerboard for example.

00:49:53.820 --> 00:49:57.660
So there are lots of nuances
to symmetry theory, it's

00:49:57.660 --> 00:50:00.960
mathematics and the nice thing
about mathematics is it's your

00:50:00.960 --> 00:50:03.360
ballgame, you could make up the
rules and as long as you

00:50:03.360 --> 00:50:06.780
play according to those rules
consistently, then you've got

00:50:06.780 --> 00:50:10.770
something that people
can't quarrel with.

00:50:10.770 --> 00:50:15.320
OK, I think my internal clock
has just told me that it's

00:50:15.320 --> 00:50:17.720
five minutes of the hour and
it's time to take our break.

00:50:20.360 --> 00:50:23.120
Come up by all means and play
with the mirrors if you'd like

00:50:23.120 --> 00:50:26.800
and we'll resume the
lecture part of our

00:50:26.800 --> 00:50:28.170
discussion in 10 minutes.

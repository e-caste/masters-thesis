00:00:22.095 --> 00:00:24.720
WINRICH FREIWALD: So my talk is
going to be mostly about faces.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:25.830
And in many ways
I'm going to connect

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.900
to what Jim DiCarlo
was talking about today

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.246
and what Nancy
talked about today.

00:00:30.246 --> 00:00:31.620
I just thought
preparing for this

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:34.203
that I should say a few things
about primates and intelligence

00:00:34.203 --> 00:00:37.170
and how face recognition
might be connected

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.960
both to the species
we are studying

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.614
and to the overall
question of intelligence.

00:00:42.614 --> 00:00:44.280
And I thought the
most appropriate thing

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.780
to do this at MBL
would be to start

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.482
with this kind of creature.

00:00:47.482 --> 00:00:49.440
So you might have seen
in the paper Nature that

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.210
came out last week--

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.610
that the genome of the
octopus was sequenced.

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.980
It was really heralded
in the public press

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.260
that it's finally proving
their intelligence.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.320
The argument is that
there are 33,000 genes,

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.957
10,000 more than humans.

00:01:02.957 --> 00:01:04.790
That's of course not a
very strong argument.

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:06.870
There are plants
with 45,000 genes.

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:09.480
So that really doesn't tell you
very much about intelligence.

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.104
But amongst those
genes that were found

00:01:11.104 --> 00:01:14.130
were lots of genes that are
important for development

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.970
of the brain.

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.030
And there is very
high heterogeneity

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.150
in certain gene families that
are controlling the development

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:21.180
of the nervous system.

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.030
So it's one example of
how a better understanding

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.404
the intelligence of other
creatures in neural terms,

00:01:27.404 --> 00:01:29.820
even in creatures like the
octopus which is very difficult

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:30.437
to study.

00:01:30.437 --> 00:01:32.520
The point I would like to
stress about the octopus

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.692
is there's really nothing
social about the species.

00:01:35.692 --> 00:01:37.650
Actually almost simultaneously
with this paper,

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.440
there was one report
about sexual reproduction

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.260
in one particular species of
octopus where it's not clear

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.600
if it's violence
or more affection.

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.520
But this is really
the one exception

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.830
to otherwise a life that's
pretty much non-social at all.

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.880
So in the octopus you have
the egg stage and then

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.280
this larva which are
hatching very early on.

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.530
There's no interaction with
mom or anything like this.

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.000
They go to the
surface of the ocean

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.570
and they start feeding and try
to grow as fast as they can

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.570
because only a few of
them are going to survive.

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.139
Then reproduction is a
very scary enterprise.

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:12.330
In many octopus,
the male has to be

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.960
careful not to be eaten by
the female in the process.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.954
When it's successful, then
actually the male stops eating.

00:02:18.954 --> 00:02:21.120
He's going to die even
before most of the youngsters

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.140
are going to hatch.

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.250
And all that mom is going to
do is basically to make sure

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.550
that fresh water is going
to be delivered to the eggs.

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.710
And that's it in
terms of social life.

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:37.230
So you can be very intelligent
like an octopus and, who knows,

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.310
Gabriel just mentioned
extraterrestrial life.

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.259
Maybe other species out there
might also not be that social.

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:43.800
And so there doesn't
necessarily have

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.920
to be a connection between
sociality and intelligence.

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.816
Second thing is it
can be very social,

00:02:49.816 --> 00:02:51.690
get a warm fuzzy feeling
of being with others

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.730
and you get lots of
protection being in the group,

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.020
but following your
instincts in this way

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:56.970
doesn't necessarily
make you very smart.

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.490
So I don't want to argue
against the connection

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:01.470
between sociality
and intelligence

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.500
in the form of
social intelligence.

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.030
But we have to be careful
there's no necessary connection

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.470
between those.

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.880
However for primates
there is this idea,

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.870
this social
intelligence hypothesis

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.210
that really what made
primates so intelligent

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:15.234
is their sociality.

00:03:15.234 --> 00:03:17.650
And so let's consider a little
bit what the arguments are.

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.480
It was most strongly put
forward by Nick Humphrey in '76,

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.327
but there are similar
precursors to this idea.

00:03:24.327 --> 00:03:25.410
So who are these primates?

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.260
The primates are a
small group of mammals

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.525
with about 400 plus species.

00:03:30.525 --> 00:03:31.400
They're very diverse.

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.060
You can have very
small primates,

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.690
just 30 grams, all the way
to 200 kilogram animals.

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:41.110
They evolved, studying
65, 85 million years ago,

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:42.600
there was this mass extinction.

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.360
And so you have this high
diversity within the mammals

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.170
starting from this point on.

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.570
So they have certain things
in common with other mammals,

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:52.080
but they're also very
special in many ways.

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.410
All of the primate
species are social.

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:56.940
They're not [INAUDIBLE]
social, but they are social.

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:58.330
They develop very slowly.

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:01.280
So it's really very
different from the octopus.

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.780
A lot of investment is made
into the offspring There are not

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.819
very many offspring.

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:07.860
And the lifespan of these
animals is pretty long.

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:10.890
The octopus life span
is three to five years.

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:12.880
They're very visual,
rather than other mammals,

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.190
which are very
olfactory oriented.

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:17.490
They have binocular vision,
many have color vision,

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:19.980
so vision is very
important for primates.

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:23.820
And they have on average larger
brains than other mammals have.

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.010
So our understanding of
the anatomy of primates

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:28.485
and what makes this special
is actually very rudimentary.

00:04:28.485 --> 00:04:31.886
But there are a few points
that should be of interest.

00:04:31.886 --> 00:04:33.510
So if you look at
the mammalian brains,

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:35.130
obviously they're very, very
complex mammalian brains.

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:36.720
They're not primate
[INAUDIBLE] ones.

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.910
And the main factor
really is body mass.

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.650
So the bigger an
animal is, this is

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:46.780
elementary of body weight
versus brain weight.

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:48.900
And you can see there's
a log-log relationship

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:49.980
between the two.

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:52.560
That's something that you find
all over the animal kingdom.

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:56.910
But if you compare primates
to other non-primate mammals

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:58.980
you can see that there
is a larger increase

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:00.532
with body mass of brain mass.

00:05:00.532 --> 00:05:02.990
And if you count the number of
neurons, the number of brain

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:05.390
neurons, it is increasing
more steeply with body mass

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:07.109
than it is in other mammals.

00:05:07.109 --> 00:05:08.900
This is obviously a
very crude measurement.

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:10.320
There are others.

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.350
If you look for brains
roughly the same weight,

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:14.610
you can again see
like in primates, you

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:17.030
have many more neurons
than in non-primates

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:18.849
just by these two examples here.

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:21.390
So there seems to be something
different in the organization.

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:23.098
There are other measures
you can look at.

00:05:23.098 --> 00:05:26.450
So for example, the
neuron size is increasing

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:27.740
with brain size in rodents.

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:29.870
So a larger brain
in rodents is not

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:32.000
necessarily one that
has many more neurons,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.750
but these neurons are
just getting bigger.

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:35.770
And in primates this is
really not so much the case.

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:37.311
So the size of the
neuron pretty much

00:05:37.311 --> 00:05:39.980
stays constant even if you
decrease the size of the brain.

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:42.499
Or how much white matter do
you actually need per neuron

00:05:42.499 --> 00:05:43.790
to connect other brain regions?

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:46.225
In rodents, apparently
the fiber caliber

00:05:46.225 --> 00:05:48.240
is increasing with brain size.

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.240
So again, your brain
might grow just

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:53.750
because the anatomy
of the basic element

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:55.431
requires that it
will need more space.

00:05:55.431 --> 00:05:56.930
But in primates
that's not the case.

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:58.430
If you get more
white brain matter,

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:02.240
that's likely because the
connectivity is more complex.

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.490
Primate brains also fold
faster with increasing size

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:05.450
than rodent neurons.

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:07.640
So these are all just
very coarse indications

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:09.140
that maybe there's
something special

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:12.680
about the primate brain compared
to other mammalian brains.

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:14.990
So along the anatomy, I
mentioned that primates

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:16.370
have forward-facing eyes.

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:18.940
They can do binocular vision,
they have color vision.

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:20.690
They have skulls
with a large cranium,

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:24.140
that's something that makes
them special from other mammals.

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:27.807
They're also special in other
ways that are important.

00:06:27.807 --> 00:06:29.390
If you think about
embodied cognition,

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:31.223
you don't have to buy
into all these points,

00:06:31.223 --> 00:06:33.742
but obviously if you have
a hand as complex as ours

00:06:33.742 --> 00:06:35.450
which we share with
many primate species,

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:36.950
there are lots of
things you can do.

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:39.500
And that requires you to
be able to control it.

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:42.020
And this gives you a power to
interact with the environment

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:44.090
that other animals
might not have.

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:45.950
So the shoulder is
more mobile, there's

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:48.100
an opposable thumb
in many species.

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:50.810
And then in the face, there are
changes that you might already

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:51.740
have seen here.

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:55.790
So if you go up to the
more complex animals,

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:59.060
the snout region is becoming
increasingly reduced.

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:02.190
And I will tell you later
why this might be important.

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:04.690
So these are anatomical
specialization in primates.

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:06.794
Sociality is very
important as well.

00:07:06.794 --> 00:07:08.960
And so there are four main
organizational principles

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:10.100
of sociality in primates.

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:12.140
The dominating one is
the second one here.

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:14.120
It's called the male
transfer system.

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:19.470
So it's a polygamous,
multi-male organization.

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:22.040
This is very important for
the social life of primates

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:24.650
because what it means is
that the social behavior has

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:25.574
to be complex.

00:07:25.574 --> 00:07:27.740
So there can be cooperation,
like grooming, defense,

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:29.573
and hunting which all
the animals of a troop

00:07:29.573 --> 00:07:30.630
might engage in.

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:33.000
But at the same time there's
competition for food,

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.779
mates dominance, hierarchies.

00:07:34.779 --> 00:07:36.320
And it's a function
of the complexity

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:39.340
of the social environment.

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:41.482
So primate social
life was beautifully

00:07:41.482 --> 00:07:43.440
inscribed by Dorothy
Cheney and Robert Seyfarth

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:45.300
in this wonderful book
Baboon Metaphysics.

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:46.883
And I'm just going
to quote from that.

00:07:46.883 --> 00:07:49.806
So they studied baboon
monkeys in the wild and here's

00:07:49.806 --> 00:07:51.180
what they have to
say about this.

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:53.550
"The domain of expertise
for baboons, and indeed

00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:55.920
for all monkeys and
apes, is social life.

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:58.380
Most baboons live in multi-male
and multi-female groups

00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:02.130
that typically include eight
or nine metrolineal families."

00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:04.172
Which means that the
females stay in the group

00:08:04.172 --> 00:08:05.630
and they found
families and they're

00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:08.155
going to stay constant
over a long period of time.

00:08:08.155 --> 00:08:09.780
"They have a linear
dominance hierarchy

00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:12.750
of males the changes often and
the linear hierarchy of females

00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:15.660
and the offsprings that can
be stable for generations.

00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:18.840
Daily life in a baboon group
includes small scale alliances

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:20.550
that may involve only
three individuals

00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:23.460
and occasional large scale
familiar battles that

00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:27.030
involve all of the members
of three or four metrolines.

00:08:27.030 --> 00:08:29.400
Males and females can
form short term bonds that

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:32.309
lead to reproduction, or longer
term friendships that lead

00:08:32.309 --> 00:08:34.770
to cooperative child rearing."

00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:36.600
"The result of all
this social intrigue

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:38.549
is a kind of Jane
Austen melodrama

00:08:38.549 --> 00:08:41.669
in which each individual must
predict the behavior of others

00:08:41.669 --> 00:08:43.200
and form those
relationships that

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:45.310
return the greatest benefits.

00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:47.680
These are the problems that
the baboon mind must solve

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:49.890
and this is the environment
in which it has evolved."

00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:51.660
Most of the problems
facing baboons

00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:55.357
can be expressed in two
words: other baboons.

00:08:55.357 --> 00:08:56.690
And so this is really important.

00:08:56.690 --> 00:08:59.174
So again, if you're social
you don't necessarily

00:08:59.174 --> 00:09:00.090
have to be very smart.

00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:01.620
You can be very smart
and not be social.

00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:03.286
But there's something
special apparently

00:09:03.286 --> 00:09:08.010
about primates that links our
intelligence to our sociality.

00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:10.020
So again, the Social
Intelligence Hypothesis,

00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:13.950
what works in its favor is that
the primates have large brains.

00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:15.770
And primates,
apparently group size

00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:18.570
is correlated with brain size
across different species,

00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:19.830
and not the home-range size.

00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:21.270
This is an
alternative hypothesis

00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:24.680
is that maybe you have to forage
in more complex environments.

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:26.700
And so a similar proxy
for the complexity

00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:28.639
of your social life
and your physical life

00:09:28.639 --> 00:09:30.180
predicts there's a
better correlation

00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:33.406
of brain size with the social
life than physical life.

00:09:33.406 --> 00:09:34.780
The complexity of
an individual's

00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:37.321
social relationships increases
exponentially with group size.

00:09:37.321 --> 00:09:38.580
And groups are not small.

00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:40.550
And we're going to get back
to this point in a little bit.

00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:42.660
The baboons and other primates
know their peer's dominance,

00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:43.770
rank, and social relations.

00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:45.300
Everything that I mentioned
in the previous slide

00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:47.160
is good evidence
for behavioral work

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:49.890
that actually primates
know something about it.

00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:52.410
This social knowledge
contrasts with surprising cases

00:09:52.410 --> 00:09:54.660
of ignorance outside
of the social domain.

00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:58.870
Even when it's something
as important as a predator.

00:09:58.870 --> 00:10:01.480
So Cheney and Seyfard, they
also studied vervet monkeys.

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:04.110
And what they observed
is that vervet monkeys,

00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:06.930
one of the main predators
to them is a python.

00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:09.390
And the python, if
it crawls in the sand

00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:10.720
it leaves behind a trail.

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:12.540
And there is absolutely no
indication that the vervet

00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:14.540
monkeys make the connection
between these trails

00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:16.002
and the presence of the python.

00:10:16.002 --> 00:10:17.460
Which is really
striking, you would

00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:20.010
imagine this is the first thing
that they would have to learn.

00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:21.000
So there are cases
where they actually

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.374
follow the trail into the bush
and they're very surprised

00:10:23.374 --> 00:10:24.730
to find a python there.

00:10:24.730 --> 00:10:26.532
Another example
is, are leopards.

00:10:26.532 --> 00:10:27.990
So in the environment,
leopards are

00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:31.389
of course predators who also
feed on the vervet monkeys.

00:10:31.389 --> 00:10:33.680
Leopards have a way of putting
the carcasses of animals

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:36.390
they hunted down into the trees
to protect them from larger

00:10:36.390 --> 00:10:37.959
predators like lions.

00:10:37.959 --> 00:10:39.750
So the presence of a
carcass would actually

00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:42.600
indicate to you that likely
there is a leopard around.

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:44.416
And again, the
vervet monkeys they

00:10:44.416 --> 00:10:45.540
don't make that connection.

00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:47.190
So if there is a
carcas there, they're

00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:49.000
not particularly
scared about it.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.110
It doesn't mean that
they're ignorant.

00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:52.350
So they're even following
alarm calls from other species

00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:54.000
as to whether an
eagle is approaching,

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.890
or if cattle is approaching.

00:10:55.890 --> 00:10:59.010
So it's not that they're
generally dumb in this way,

00:10:59.010 --> 00:11:02.070
but there's really this very big
contrast about all the details

00:11:02.070 --> 00:11:04.560
that they know about their
social world and the obliviance

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:09.942
that they can express
for non-social factors.

00:11:09.942 --> 00:11:11.400
Then we have
specializations, we're

00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:14.050
going to talk about this
in the brain for processing

00:11:14.050 --> 00:11:15.534
social stimuli.

00:11:15.534 --> 00:11:16.950
And then there's
actually evidence

00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:19.283
that females who have better
social abilities, that they

00:11:19.283 --> 00:11:22.020
are less stressed and they have
better reproductive success.

00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:26.100
And so this all works to
say that if you are socially

00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:28.671
smart in a baboon environment
or in the environment

00:11:28.671 --> 00:11:30.420
of many primate species,
you actually have

00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:31.716
better success of reproducing.

00:11:31.716 --> 00:11:33.090
Therefore there's
a good argument

00:11:33.090 --> 00:11:36.675
to be made that your social
intelligence will therefore

00:11:36.675 --> 00:11:37.950
go to the next generation.

00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:40.161
This is how social
intelligence might improve.

00:11:40.161 --> 00:11:41.910
I think there's one
important point that's

00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:42.842
oftentimes not made.

00:11:42.842 --> 00:11:45.300
And that's if you become smarter
and smarter in interacting

00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:47.820
with your physical environment,
your physical environment

00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:49.302
does not change very much.

00:11:49.302 --> 00:11:51.510
But if you are interacting
with a social environment,

00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:53.310
and getting smarter
and smarter interacting

00:11:53.310 --> 00:11:55.260
with the social
environment, the elements

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.130
in your social environment
you're interacting with,

00:11:57.130 --> 00:11:58.838
they're also getting
smarter and smarter.

00:11:58.838 --> 00:12:00.990
So you're actually
setting forth an arms race

00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:03.960
where you're not only improving
the situation by getting

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:05.560
smarter, but we
have to get smart

00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:08.184
in order to keep pace with the
others who are outsmarting you.

00:12:08.184 --> 00:12:09.600
And so you can see
how there could

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:12.294
be a connection between
sociality and intelligence.

00:12:12.294 --> 00:12:13.710
That there's really
this arms race

00:12:13.710 --> 00:12:15.870
does not occur for
physical interactions

00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:17.470
but for social interactions.

00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:19.740
So that you actually have
to be able to better predict

00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:21.960
the next move of someone
else in your group

00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:24.870
and you have to know something
about that individual for you

00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:26.551
to be successful.

00:12:26.551 --> 00:12:28.800
So there are arguments against
the Social Intelligence

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:30.000
Hypothesis.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.770
So, in particular,
we're ignorant

00:12:31.770 --> 00:12:33.280
about many other species.

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:35.970
So there are other social
species, hyenas for example

00:12:35.970 --> 00:12:38.740
have complex societies, but
hyenas have not been studied

00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:41.950
as much as monkeys have.

00:12:41.950 --> 00:12:43.780
We also don't know
about the complexity,

00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:45.870
mostly for this reason,
where they're really

00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:48.400
compared to whales,
whales for example,

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:50.251
primate societies
are more complex.

00:12:50.251 --> 00:12:52.250
And this of course would
be a crucial conjecture

00:12:52.250 --> 00:12:55.709
of this Social
Intelligence Hypothesis.

00:12:55.709 --> 00:12:57.250
Then within the
primate orders, there

00:12:57.250 --> 00:12:58.780
are actually some
other correlations

00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:00.322
that do predict
brain size very well.

00:13:00.322 --> 00:13:02.863
And so within the primate order,
social learning, innovation,

00:13:02.863 --> 00:13:05.140
and tool use are strongly
correlated with brain size

00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:06.330
and not with group size.

00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:08.830
So you could imagine a scenario
where actually the evolution

00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:11.200
of basic, social
intelligence is something

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:13.150
that's very basic to primates.

00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:15.010
But then if you go
to different species

00:13:15.010 --> 00:13:17.470
within the primate
order and ask like why

00:13:17.470 --> 00:13:20.740
did they become so smart,
like orangutans or chimps who

00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:22.270
can use tools, then
it really might

00:13:22.270 --> 00:13:23.811
be the tool use that
would be of more

00:13:23.811 --> 00:13:25.674
importance than the sociality.

00:13:25.674 --> 00:13:28.090
So I have a movie here that
actually illustrates these two

00:13:28.090 --> 00:13:29.314
different hypotheses.

00:13:29.314 --> 00:13:31.230
So you see social
interactions here in a group

00:13:31.230 --> 00:13:32.410
of Tonkin macaque monkeys.

00:13:32.410 --> 00:13:33.910
You can see the
facial displays, you

00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:35.810
can see that they are
tending to each other.

00:13:35.810 --> 00:13:38.268
And well you might think that
they are trying to figure out

00:13:38.268 --> 00:13:39.670
what's actually going on here.

00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:43.030
And here's the alternative
hypothesis of this.

00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:44.060
This is tool use.

00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:47.390
So you can see this guy
just invented a cool tool,

00:13:47.390 --> 00:13:48.430
a nose pick.

00:13:48.430 --> 00:13:50.380
And so it's anyone's
guess what's

00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:52.105
more important to
your intelligence,

00:13:52.105 --> 00:13:53.980
you been able to read
the social significance

00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:55.396
of other individuals
in your troop

00:13:55.396 --> 00:13:59.990
or your ability to
invent a nice nose pick.

00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:03.995
So the last point I wanted
to make is a question.

00:14:03.995 --> 00:14:06.370
So are the primates' abilities
in social knowledge really

00:14:06.370 --> 00:14:08.440
intelligent or is
it just more like

00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:09.800
idiot savant-like abilities?

00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:12.850
So a unique specialization
where they're good at.

00:14:12.850 --> 00:14:15.710
The argument that Cheney and
Seyfard made is the following.

00:14:15.710 --> 00:14:17.668
So the knowledge that
they have should actually

00:14:17.668 --> 00:14:19.835
be true knowledge and just
not learned associations.

00:14:19.835 --> 00:14:21.667
And the reason has to
do with the complexity

00:14:21.667 --> 00:14:22.880
of the social environment.

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:25.060
If you have 80 different
individuals, which

00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:27.580
is the typical case for
these baboon monkeys,

00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:32.999
you have 3,160 pairs of
animals and 82,160 trails.

00:14:32.999 --> 00:14:34.540
It's going to be
virtually impossible

00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:36.415
for you to learn all
these different pairwise

00:14:36.415 --> 00:14:39.760
relationships and then behave
intelligently based upon it.

00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:42.640
Second, these relationships
can change very fast.

00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:44.862
So it would not be very
smart to try and make

00:14:44.862 --> 00:14:46.570
a list of all these
pairwise interactions

00:14:46.570 --> 00:14:48.370
and then act upon that.

00:14:48.370 --> 00:14:49.960
No single behavioral
metric seems

00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:52.270
to be necessary or sufficient
to recognize associations

00:14:52.270 --> 00:14:53.920
like matrilinear kin.

00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:55.510
So human observers
are apparently not

00:14:55.510 --> 00:14:57.843
very good to predict this if
they don't know the animals

00:14:57.843 --> 00:14:59.547
very well personally.

00:14:59.547 --> 00:15:01.130
Then you might think,
well, maybe it's

00:15:01.130 --> 00:15:03.088
not physically like a
list but you don't really

00:15:03.088 --> 00:15:05.440
learn this much and you
apply a simple rule to it.

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:07.484
And that also doesn't
seem to work very well

00:15:07.484 --> 00:15:09.400
because social relationships
like friendships,

00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:10.684
they are intransitive.

00:15:10.684 --> 00:15:12.100
So if A and B are
friends, B and C

00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:13.900
are friends, that doesn't
mean that A and C necessarily

00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:15.110
have to be friends.

00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:17.080
Others like family
relationships are complex,

00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:18.080
they're non-associative.

00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:19.900
So if A is the mother
of B, that actually

00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:21.850
means that B is not
the mother of A.

00:15:21.850 --> 00:15:24.560
So there's a more complex
interaction there as well.

00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:28.240
And then finally, there can
be simultaneous membership

00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:29.800
in multiple classes.

00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:32.050
And again, for you to be
able to keep track of this,

00:15:32.050 --> 00:15:33.424
you better have
a cognitive model

00:15:33.424 --> 00:15:36.190
of what's going on rather than
just a list of associations

00:15:36.190 --> 00:15:36.947
that you learned.

00:15:36.947 --> 00:15:38.530
It's very difficult
in experimentation

00:15:38.530 --> 00:15:40.000
to prove it's not
association, but I

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:41.485
think these are very good
arguments to consider

00:15:41.485 --> 00:15:43.690
that actually these primates
have active knowledge

00:15:43.690 --> 00:15:45.950
of their social environment.

00:15:45.950 --> 00:15:48.220
So there's one example for
this where you can actually

00:15:48.220 --> 00:15:49.110
make the point very nicely.

00:15:49.110 --> 00:15:50.360
And this is the story of Ahla.

00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:56.020
Ahla is a baboon monkey
and she was actually

00:15:56.020 --> 00:15:58.580
living with farmers
in South West Africa.

00:15:58.580 --> 00:16:01.600
So there was a habit at the
time to actually replace

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:05.080
dogs who were herding
goats with baboons.

00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:07.420
And so you can see
Ahla sitting here.

00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:10.220
You can see her
here adopting some

00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:11.560
of the behavior of the goats.

00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:14.590
So she's licking salt here,
which is something that baboons

00:16:14.590 --> 00:16:15.798
would naturally not do.

00:16:15.798 --> 00:16:18.006
She would continue to engage
in social behaviors that

00:16:18.006 --> 00:16:19.005
are typical for baboons.

00:16:19.005 --> 00:16:21.820
So she would groom the
goats, for example.

00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:24.140
But the most amazing
thing about her,

00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:26.290
which is a little hard to
see as you see her here,

00:16:26.290 --> 00:16:29.290
she's carrying one of the
little yearlings here,

00:16:29.290 --> 00:16:31.540
and brings it to its mother.

00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:34.000
And the description of
what this animal was doing

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.370
was when the goats
were brought home

00:16:36.370 --> 00:16:39.820
and then sometimes they were
separating the mother goats

00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:43.210
from the offspring, she would
actually go manic and then

00:16:43.210 --> 00:16:44.980
try to pair them up
and she would not

00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:47.080
stop until she was finished.

00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:49.420
And this would even
happen as multiple goats

00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:52.250
were calling for the
yearlings and then vise versa.

00:16:52.250 --> 00:16:55.207
And so she would have to put
order into the social world

00:16:55.207 --> 00:16:57.040
that she was living in
and she wouldn't stop

00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:58.487
until this order was restored.

00:16:58.487 --> 00:17:00.070
And the farmer said
that they were not

00:17:00.070 --> 00:17:04.030
able to tell any of the
adult goals or the yearlings

00:17:04.030 --> 00:17:05.173
or know any of the pairs.

00:17:05.173 --> 00:17:06.339
But this was like her world.

00:17:06.339 --> 00:17:07.990
This was like a social
environment that she was in

00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:09.490
and she would
structure it according

00:17:09.490 --> 00:17:12.069
to her cognitive demands.

00:17:12.069 --> 00:17:13.599
So the point is
that primates have

00:17:13.599 --> 00:17:15.485
intricate social knowledge.

00:17:15.485 --> 00:17:17.359
So they know about the
status of individuals,

00:17:17.359 --> 00:17:19.119
like their age or their gender.

00:17:19.119 --> 00:17:21.369
They know about the
interactions of individuals.

00:17:21.369 --> 00:17:24.250
They recognize them very simply
like grooming and mothering.

00:17:24.250 --> 00:17:25.930
And then based on
these observations

00:17:25.930 --> 00:17:28.150
of the different individuals
in the social world,

00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:30.730
they built these
cognitive structures

00:17:30.730 --> 00:17:32.670
like friendship,
kinship, and hierarchy,

00:17:32.670 --> 00:17:35.900
have an interesting,
complicated structure to them.

00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:39.150
All of this is rooted in
the concept of the person.

00:17:39.150 --> 00:17:40.780
And this is very
important and as I'm

00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:41.810
going to be talking
about face recognition,

00:17:41.810 --> 00:17:43.939
I have to emphasize these
are two different things.

00:17:43.939 --> 00:17:45.730
You can recognize a
person from their face,

00:17:45.730 --> 00:17:47.146
but if you can
recognize a face it

00:17:47.146 --> 00:17:51.217
doesn't mean that you know who
it is, who is behind the face.

00:17:51.217 --> 00:17:53.550
So the person concept would
include something like this.

00:17:53.550 --> 00:17:55.124
It's a juvenile, female monkey.

00:17:55.124 --> 00:17:57.040
It's the daughter of x
and so on and so forth.

00:17:57.040 --> 00:17:58.250
So this is knowledge
that we have.

00:17:58.250 --> 00:18:00.100
It's actually been shown in
rhesus monkeys, the monkeys

00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:01.641
that we work with,
that they actually

00:18:01.641 --> 00:18:04.510
have this person knowledge.

00:18:04.510 --> 00:18:05.680
So why do we study faces?

00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:07.900
So for us faces really
are the ideal intersection

00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:10.990
between object
recognition, the study

00:18:10.990 --> 00:18:15.590
of which Jim DiCarlo talked
about, and social cognition.

00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:19.540
So as Jim was
alluding to yesterday,

00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:21.664
vision is really
important in primates.

00:18:21.664 --> 00:18:23.080
About a third of
the primate brain

00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:25.040
is thought to be involved
in visual function.

00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:25.750
So this is a lot.

00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:27.160
And this is
testament to the fact

00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:28.060
that there's a
lot of information

00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:30.160
to be gathered from the
outside visual world,

00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:32.800
but also that it's difficult
computationally to gather this.

00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:35.770
And so Jim was explaining some
of the computational challenges

00:18:35.770 --> 00:18:37.870
that object recognition
has to solve yesterday

00:18:37.870 --> 00:18:41.810
and then we'll come back to some
of his points a little later.

00:18:41.810 --> 00:18:43.150
So what is an object?

00:18:43.150 --> 00:18:45.700
So Jim was saying that it's
the basic unit of cognition.

00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:48.040
And just very quickly,
what it actually is it's

00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:49.534
more than a collection
of features.

00:18:49.534 --> 00:18:50.950
So the Gestalt
Rules of Perception

00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:51.960
actually emphasize this.

00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:53.918
So if you have proximity
of elements, you group

00:18:53.918 --> 00:18:54.520
them together.

00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:56.110
If these elements
share similarity,

00:18:56.110 --> 00:18:58.006
you group them together
to larger entities.

00:18:58.006 --> 00:18:59.380
If there's good
continuation, you

00:18:59.380 --> 00:19:01.669
group these local elements
together into lines.

00:19:01.669 --> 00:19:03.460
If that's common fate,
you group them again

00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:05.170
together to larger entities.

00:19:05.170 --> 00:19:07.277
And something similar
is true for faces.

00:19:07.277 --> 00:19:08.860
If you have different
face parts, then

00:19:08.860 --> 00:19:11.410
the wrong organization but
now you put them together

00:19:11.410 --> 00:19:13.510
correctly, you can
suddenly recognize a face.

00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:15.790
So there's a larger
scale organization to not

00:19:15.790 --> 00:19:18.140
that goes beyond just being
a collection of features.

00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:20.556
And maybe something similar
is going on for a higher order

00:19:20.556 --> 00:19:23.380
condition that I'm sure other
people are going to talk about.

00:19:23.380 --> 00:19:25.050
And it's in the
physical interactions,

00:19:25.050 --> 00:19:29.230
we infer causality from
just the sequence of events.

00:19:29.230 --> 00:19:32.030
Or social interactions,
like in Heider-Simmel movies

00:19:32.030 --> 00:19:34.319
where you are telling yourself
a complex social story

00:19:34.319 --> 00:19:35.860
unfold even when
there's just simple,

00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:37.780
geometric shapes moving around.

00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:41.030
So this creation of higher
order representations I think

00:19:41.030 --> 00:19:42.631
is essential for
object recognition.

00:19:42.631 --> 00:19:44.380
It's a constructive
process that the brain

00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:45.880
imposes on the
piece of information

00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:47.230
it gets from the eyes.

00:19:47.230 --> 00:19:49.180
It's not just a
collection of features.

00:19:49.180 --> 00:19:51.616
It's kind of the basis of
symbolic representations.

00:19:51.616 --> 00:19:52.990
It can create
meaning, especially

00:19:52.990 --> 00:19:55.490
if you think about the face,
if it's the face of someone you

00:19:55.490 --> 00:19:57.230
know that's very meaningful.

00:19:57.230 --> 00:19:59.350
And it makes
information actionable.

00:19:59.350 --> 00:20:01.400
And these are really,
I think, the import

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:03.670
links between object recognition
and social cognition,

00:20:03.670 --> 00:20:07.449
and faces are smack
in the middle of this.

00:20:07.449 --> 00:20:08.740
So I already showed this movie.

00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:11.590
To use again I emphasize
the social communication

00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:12.779
that's taking place here.

00:20:12.779 --> 00:20:14.320
You can see the
facial displays here.

00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:16.860
So the older male who's
chasing the younger animal

00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:18.212
is making these facial displays.

00:20:18.212 --> 00:20:20.420
By the way, most of you will
never have seen a Tonkin

00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:22.586
macaque and still you cannot
understand what's going

00:20:22.586 --> 00:20:24.400
on there.

00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:26.170
This is something
very special, again

00:20:26.170 --> 00:20:28.870
that you don't have in all
animals, these facial displays.

00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:32.110
And Charles Darwin was actually
again one of the first people

00:20:32.110 --> 00:20:35.530
to notice it in 1872 is that
you use your face to express

00:20:35.530 --> 00:20:36.631
your emotional state.

00:20:36.631 --> 00:20:38.380
Otherwise your emotions
are private to you

00:20:38.380 --> 00:20:41.770
but you use body language
and then facial language

00:20:41.770 --> 00:20:43.155
to suppress your emotions.

00:20:43.155 --> 00:20:45.280
And oftentimes you do it
even if you don't want to.

00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:47.330
It just happens automatically.

00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:49.280
And that's not possible
in all animals.

00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:50.920
So if you are a fish
or a frog, there

00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:52.720
are lots of really
cool things you can do.

00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:54.970
You can sit on the front
porch and enjoy the day.

00:20:54.970 --> 00:20:57.760
So lots of things that you can
have in common with primates.

00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:00.220
But facial communication
really requires something

00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:02.940
more that's very
mammalian specific.

00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:04.900
In mammals you actually
have in the face

00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:07.390
musculature that it's not
attaching from bone to bone,

00:21:07.390 --> 00:21:09.310
but it's now
attaching to the skin.

00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:11.950
And so if you look at these two
rats here where their whiskers,

00:21:11.950 --> 00:21:14.200
I hope you can see it here,
in the end are labeled.

00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:16.830
You can see they're actively
exploring each other's faces

00:21:16.830 --> 00:21:18.510
in a somewhat sensory fashion.

00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:21.010
That's possible because they
can move their whiskers because

00:21:21.010 --> 00:21:22.264
of this musculature.

00:21:22.264 --> 00:21:23.680
And that's a
specialization that's

00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:25.155
becoming more and more
refined in primates.

00:21:25.155 --> 00:21:27.150
So in rhesus monkeys
and chimps and humans,

00:21:27.150 --> 00:21:29.124
we have 23 different
facial muscles.

00:21:29.124 --> 00:21:30.790
They're becoming more
and more flexible.

00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:33.123
I mentioned before that the
snout region is increasingly

00:21:33.123 --> 00:21:34.010
reduced in primates.

00:21:34.010 --> 00:21:35.050
So you have some
simpler primates

00:21:35.050 --> 00:21:36.820
where there's still
a strong snout, which

00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:38.887
is limiting the ability
of the face to move.

00:21:38.887 --> 00:21:41.470
But the more complex the primate
is getting, the more flexible

00:21:41.470 --> 00:21:43.303
these muscles become
and the more expressive

00:21:43.303 --> 00:21:44.080
the faces become.

00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:46.960
So the face now becomes richer
and richer with social signals

00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:48.160
that can read out.

00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:50.110
And in rhesus monkeys
which are shown here,

00:21:50.110 --> 00:21:51.860
you have a fixed set
of facial expressions

00:21:51.860 --> 00:21:54.715
that, again, for a system
that can analyze these,

00:21:54.715 --> 00:21:57.430
it's very important information
about the emotional state

00:21:57.430 --> 00:21:59.539
of another animal.

00:21:59.539 --> 00:22:01.330
Primates are also very
interested in faces.

00:22:01.330 --> 00:22:06.010
I'd very much like to show
this movie which is showing

00:22:06.010 --> 00:22:08.847
a three-day-old macaque monkey.

00:22:08.847 --> 00:22:10.930
And I'll tell you what the
point of this study is.

00:22:10.930 --> 00:22:12.920
So you can see that he's
attending very closely

00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:14.317
to the face of the experimenter.

00:22:14.317 --> 00:22:16.900
Of course, if there were bananas
you might think he would also

00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:19.150
be, this isn't proof that
there is this specialization

00:22:19.150 --> 00:22:21.250
for faces that Nancy
was alluding to before,

00:22:21.250 --> 00:22:22.990
but it's at least intuitive.

00:22:22.990 --> 00:22:25.180
The second thing why I
like to show this movie

00:22:25.180 --> 00:22:27.250
is exactly what
happened right now.

00:22:27.250 --> 00:22:28.810
You're all getting
really excited

00:22:28.810 --> 00:22:31.990
about this absolutely adorable,
little critter, right?

00:22:31.990 --> 00:22:33.980
And I've seen this movie
now hundreds of times

00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:35.021
and it's still like this.

00:22:35.021 --> 00:22:36.650
It's still very
emotionally charged.

00:22:36.650 --> 00:22:38.840
So here's the third reason.

00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:40.889
The experiment is based
on facial movements here.

00:22:40.889 --> 00:22:42.930
You can see it's getting
really excited about it,

00:22:42.930 --> 00:22:44.020
it's getting very active.

00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:45.978
And now he's reproducing
these facial movements

00:22:45.978 --> 00:22:47.189
as best as he can.

00:22:47.189 --> 00:22:48.730
There's a specific
facial interaction

00:22:48.730 --> 00:22:50.869
that's happening
in human babies,

00:22:50.869 --> 00:22:51.910
I think for three months.

00:22:51.910 --> 00:22:54.119
It's happening in these
rhesus monkeys for two weeks.

00:22:54.119 --> 00:22:56.326
And you can see that there
is an intricate connection

00:22:56.326 --> 00:22:58.750
between what they're perceiving
and what they're acting on

00:22:58.750 --> 00:23:00.190
in an automatic fashion.

00:23:00.190 --> 00:23:03.070
But this emotional part I
think is really important.

00:23:03.070 --> 00:23:04.630
It's just at a
certain point that you

00:23:04.630 --> 00:23:06.220
can't control these things.

00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:09.010
Faces really get very deep into
your emotional and social brain

00:23:09.010 --> 00:23:09.750
automatically.

00:23:09.750 --> 00:23:11.680
And so one of the lines
of research in my lab

00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:12.940
is to try to figure
out the circuits

00:23:12.940 --> 00:23:14.740
that make that possible
and then to use

00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:17.280
this to get an inroad into
the social brain of function

00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:19.840
beyond face perception.

00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:22.210
So amongst the signals
the faces are sending,

00:23:22.210 --> 00:23:24.280
you recognize Charles
Darwin, so it's identity,

00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:26.300
they're getting their
social communication,

00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:28.970
there's emotional responses,
and there's also face following.

00:23:28.970 --> 00:23:31.110
So the direction that
the eyes are looking to,

00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:32.600
we are following automatically.

00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:34.808
We can control this later,
but this initial automatic

00:23:34.808 --> 00:23:35.390
response.

00:23:35.390 --> 00:23:36.765
Here's one very
nice illustration

00:23:36.765 --> 00:23:38.200
from the British TV show.

00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:40.240
You have people
wearing these glasses,

00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:43.870
actually it's a large background
to people wearing these glasses

00:23:43.870 --> 00:23:46.500
where their eyes are drawn
on these glasses that

00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:48.100
are going to one direction.

00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:50.417
And so you know that
these are not real eyes,

00:23:50.417 --> 00:23:52.000
but what's happening
is your attention

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.082
is drawn constantly to
this upper right region.

00:23:54.082 --> 00:23:55.540
And it's getting
annoying over time

00:23:55.540 --> 00:23:57.130
because you know that
there's nothing there.

00:23:57.130 --> 00:23:58.830
You know that they're not
really paying attention there.

00:23:58.830 --> 00:24:00.490
But automatically your
attention is drawn there

00:24:00.490 --> 00:24:01.930
and then you're going back
again and your attention

00:24:01.930 --> 00:24:03.230
is going out there again.

00:24:03.230 --> 00:24:04.180
And so this is
another thing that

00:24:04.180 --> 00:24:05.596
comes from the
face that gets deep

00:24:05.596 --> 00:24:08.770
into your attentional
control system.

00:24:08.770 --> 00:24:11.440
So social perception can
start with faces, but faces

00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:15.790
are the most important visual
sources of information.

00:24:15.790 --> 00:24:17.580
We get gender and age,
of course identity,

00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:19.300
and things like
perceived trustworthiness

00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:21.919
or attractiveness from just a
very brief look at the face.

00:24:21.919 --> 00:24:23.710
And then there are
these dynamical signals,

00:24:23.710 --> 00:24:25.460
like mood and overt
direction of attention

00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:27.277
that we also get from the face.

00:24:27.277 --> 00:24:28.360
So how does this all work?

00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:31.720
So Jim was already explaining
some of the challenges

00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:33.065
of object recognition to you.

00:24:33.065 --> 00:24:34.690
And so here are some
of the challenges.

00:24:34.690 --> 00:24:36.940
So first of all, the social
scene like this one here,

00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:40.150
lighting conditions can
sometimes be non-optimal.

00:24:40.150 --> 00:24:43.570
And so the first thing for you
to analyze the facial signals

00:24:43.570 --> 00:24:46.390
which are in this scene, is to
localize where the faces are.

00:24:46.390 --> 00:24:47.620
And I'm going to tell you
a little bit about what

00:24:47.620 --> 00:24:49.685
we understand about
the mechanisms of that.

00:24:49.685 --> 00:24:51.310
Then once you know
where the faces are,

00:24:51.310 --> 00:24:52.685
you want to analyze
them further,

00:24:52.685 --> 00:24:54.880
you want to know who
these individuals are.

00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:57.280
And I just realized that the
images that I had from this,

00:24:57.280 --> 00:24:59.410
which are of course also
taken from The Godfather,

00:24:59.410 --> 00:25:01.645
might not be the best.

00:25:01.645 --> 00:25:03.520
Where is the other
picture of this individual

00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:05.552
here in this display
of these five faces?

00:25:08.390 --> 00:25:10.490
Upper right.

00:25:10.490 --> 00:25:12.050
And then there's
another individual,

00:25:12.050 --> 00:25:15.280
there's Don Corleone and
there's another person down here

00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:16.530
with two different directions.

00:25:16.530 --> 00:25:18.655
And then if the lights were
down a little bit more,

00:25:18.655 --> 00:25:19.790
you could see this better.

00:25:19.790 --> 00:25:21.950
The cool thing is that we have
a way of relating these two

00:25:21.950 --> 00:25:23.616
pictures to each other
knowing that they

00:25:23.616 --> 00:25:26.232
are from the same person, even
though physically on a pixel

00:25:26.232 --> 00:25:28.190
by pixel basis these two
actually are much more

00:25:28.190 --> 00:25:29.542
similar to each other.

00:25:29.542 --> 00:25:32.000
And so we'd like to figure out
how the brain is doing that,

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:35.030
achieving object recognition,
in this case face recognition,

00:25:35.030 --> 00:25:37.760
in a manner that's invariant
to transformations that are not

00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:40.070
intrinsic to the object.

00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:42.320
This is just a reminder that
face recognition actually

00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:46.400
is very difficult. So this
is of course just made up

00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:49.550
from Curb Your Enthusiasm,
but there's a condition

00:25:49.550 --> 00:25:52.190
that many of you will have
heard about, prosopagnosia.

00:25:52.190 --> 00:25:54.380
And to a prosopagnotic
person who is face blind,

00:25:54.380 --> 00:25:56.370
the social world
might look like this.

00:25:56.370 --> 00:25:58.340
So a prosopagnotic has
great difficulty telling

00:25:58.340 --> 00:25:59.506
one individual from another.

00:25:59.506 --> 00:26:01.780
This is at least the
most typical condition.

00:26:01.780 --> 00:26:03.738
And you can imagine that
your social life would

00:26:03.738 --> 00:26:05.870
be really difficult
and your enthusiasm

00:26:05.870 --> 00:26:07.494
about socially
interacting would really

00:26:07.494 --> 00:26:09.740
be curbed if all the
individuals looked at this

00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:12.020
and looked all the same.

00:26:12.020 --> 00:26:16.550
So there must be something
about the new mechanisms that's

00:26:16.550 --> 00:26:17.420
very precise.

00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:19.378
So what's the neural
basis of face recognition?

00:26:19.378 --> 00:26:21.470
So the story really
starts with Charles Gross

00:26:21.470 --> 00:26:23.660
many years back in the
late '60s, early '70s.

00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:25.970
He was recording from the
inferotemporal cortex.

00:26:25.970 --> 00:26:28.310
He was showing pictures
of monkey faces,

00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:30.100
other social stimuli
like the monkey hand,

00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:31.670
he would scramble
the face, and then

00:26:31.670 --> 00:26:32.961
look at the responses of cells.

00:26:32.961 --> 00:26:35.370
And he was the first to find
a face selective neuron.

00:26:35.370 --> 00:26:36.110
Here's one.

00:26:36.110 --> 00:26:38.193
So these vertical lines
have the action potentials

00:26:38.193 --> 00:26:39.014
the cell is firing.

00:26:39.014 --> 00:26:40.930
This is the period of
time his face was shown.

00:26:40.930 --> 00:26:43.160
And this is the period of time
the control object, the hand,

00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:43.910
was shown.

00:26:43.910 --> 00:26:46.010
And you can see the cells
responding selectively

00:26:46.010 --> 00:26:47.960
to the face and not to the head.

00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:49.837
So this was a very nice finding.

00:26:49.837 --> 00:26:51.920
It actually took him some
time to convince himself

00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:53.420
that he could publish
it because he thought

00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:54.586
people would not believe it.

00:26:54.586 --> 00:26:57.590
It's recording a
anaesthetised animal.

00:26:57.590 --> 00:27:00.686
But luckily, he did publish
it many, many years later.

00:27:00.686 --> 00:27:02.060
And so this is
the first evidence

00:27:02.060 --> 00:27:04.311
that there is a specialization
in the brain for faces.

00:27:04.311 --> 00:27:06.310
He found many other cells
that like other things

00:27:06.310 --> 00:27:07.980
and then faces
and I think people

00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:09.920
thought that they
were intermingled

00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:10.780
with other objects.

00:27:10.780 --> 00:27:11.654
So this was the view.

00:27:11.654 --> 00:27:13.654
That this is the side
view of the macaque brain.

00:27:13.654 --> 00:27:16.112
This is the superior temporal
circuits, the one big circuit

00:27:16.112 --> 00:27:17.169
in the monkey brain.

00:27:17.169 --> 00:27:18.710
And all these symbols
here indicating

00:27:18.710 --> 00:27:20.750
positions where people found
face selective neurons.

00:27:20.750 --> 00:27:22.730
The thought was they
intermingled with object

00:27:22.730 --> 00:27:23.870
recognition hardware.

00:27:23.870 --> 00:27:25.286
It's basically the
view that there

00:27:25.286 --> 00:27:27.162
is a big IT cortex where
everything in object

00:27:27.162 --> 00:27:28.120
recognition can happen.

00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:29.090
And yes, of course
you would have

00:27:29.090 --> 00:27:30.230
some cells that
are face selective,

00:27:30.230 --> 00:27:32.521
you would have other cells
that are non-face selective.

00:27:32.521 --> 00:27:35.130
And the mixture and the
complex pattern of activity

00:27:35.130 --> 00:27:38.050
really is what gives you
the identity of the object.

00:27:38.050 --> 00:27:42.460
Then Nancy used fMRI to
discover face selective areas.

00:27:42.460 --> 00:27:44.210
So first, these are
views from face areas.

00:27:44.210 --> 00:27:47.060
We now know multiple face areas
that she was talking about

00:27:47.060 --> 00:27:47.920
before.

00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:50.366
So here are different
slices to this.

00:27:50.366 --> 00:27:51.740
And the thought
from these images

00:27:51.740 --> 00:27:54.680
really was that, no, that
maybe within this large expanse

00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:56.690
of object recognition
hardware there

00:27:56.690 --> 00:27:59.870
might be very specialized
regions that are really there

00:27:59.870 --> 00:28:02.330
selectively to process faces.

00:28:02.330 --> 00:28:04.970
And so you give the FFA, and so
the question you would ask is,

00:28:04.970 --> 00:28:07.939
is this really a region that's
devoted to face processing

00:28:07.939 --> 00:28:08.980
and face processing only?

00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:13.560
Are these regions
really face processing?

00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:15.981
Modules devoted
to face processing

00:28:15.981 --> 00:28:17.480
or is it just the
tip of the iceberg

00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:18.740
based on your
statistical analysis

00:28:18.740 --> 00:28:20.630
that this region just looks a
little bit more face selective

00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:22.250
than the neighboring regions?

00:28:22.250 --> 00:28:24.710
And second, do monkeys also
have these localized face

00:28:24.710 --> 00:28:25.460
areas like humans?

00:28:25.460 --> 00:28:26.876
And you've got the
answer already.

00:28:26.876 --> 00:28:28.075
Yes, they do.

00:28:28.075 --> 00:28:29.450
And then what is
the distribution

00:28:29.450 --> 00:28:32.660
of cells within these
regions versus outside?

00:28:32.660 --> 00:28:35.152
So this is really the
research Doris Tsao

00:28:35.152 --> 00:28:37.680
and I engaged on many years ago.

00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:39.680
We used fMRI on macaque
monkeys, same technology

00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:42.050
as in humans, slightly
different coils.

00:28:42.050 --> 00:28:43.550
And this is the
picture that we got.

00:28:43.550 --> 00:28:45.754
Very consistently across
different animals.

00:28:45.754 --> 00:28:47.420
Here in the temporal
lobe, you have six,

00:28:47.420 --> 00:28:50.500
face selective
regions that you find

00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:52.550
that anatomically
specific regions there's

00:28:52.550 --> 00:28:54.830
some variation from one
individual to the other.

00:28:54.830 --> 00:28:56.610
But with the exception of
the most posterior area,

00:28:56.610 --> 00:28:57.984
you actually find
all these areas

00:28:57.984 --> 00:29:00.015
in all individuals
on both hemispheres.

00:29:00.015 --> 00:29:02.390
There are also three areas in
the prefrontal cortex which

00:29:02.390 --> 00:29:03.742
are a little harder to find.

00:29:03.742 --> 00:29:05.200
But the one in
orbitofrontal cortex

00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:07.040
is actually is as
reproducible as the one

00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:08.370
in the temporal lobe.

00:29:08.370 --> 00:29:09.624
So, yes there are.

00:29:09.624 --> 00:29:11.540
Monkeys have localized
face areas like humans.

00:29:11.540 --> 00:29:13.250
And as Nancy was
alluding to, we actually

00:29:13.250 --> 00:29:14.420
have quite a bit
of evidence by now

00:29:14.420 --> 00:29:16.250
that these systems
might be homologous.

00:29:16.250 --> 00:29:18.722
Very, very difficult to prove
that they are homologous.

00:29:18.722 --> 00:29:20.180
But all the evidence
we have so far

00:29:20.180 --> 00:29:22.910
is really pointing
in this direction.

00:29:22.910 --> 00:29:24.710
So how selective are
these face patches?

00:29:24.710 --> 00:29:27.470
And what Doris and I did was
to lower recording electrodes

00:29:27.470 --> 00:29:30.350
into these face areas
and record from cells

00:29:30.350 --> 00:29:32.494
inside this fMRI
identified areas.

00:29:32.494 --> 00:29:34.160
And I'm going to show
you a movie of one

00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:37.137
of the first cells we recorded
from one of these regions.

00:29:37.137 --> 00:29:39.470
So it's actually a video we
took from a control monitor.

00:29:39.470 --> 00:29:41.510
So it shows the same
thing the monkey shows.

00:29:41.510 --> 00:29:44.400
The quality is not great because
it's an actual video camera

00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:45.692
we took to take this image.

00:29:45.692 --> 00:29:47.150
In addition to what
the animal saw,

00:29:47.150 --> 00:29:48.608
you will also see
this black square

00:29:48.608 --> 00:29:51.110
which is indicating where the
animal looked on the screen

00:29:51.110 --> 00:29:53.219
but the animal did not see this.

00:29:53.219 --> 00:29:55.760
And you're going to hear clicks
if everything works fine when

00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:58.334
the actual potential is fired.

00:29:58.334 --> 00:29:59.750
Anyway, here's the
quantification.

00:29:59.750 --> 00:30:04.500
So with 96 different stimuli in
this image set, 16 faces and 18

00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:07.010
non-face stimuli, this
is the average response

00:30:07.010 --> 00:30:09.282
which is normalized
between minus 1 and 1.

00:30:09.282 --> 00:30:10.990
And you can see that
the biggest response

00:30:10.990 --> 00:30:14.277
of this particular cell actually
of course to the 16 faces

00:30:14.277 --> 00:30:15.860
and not to any of
the control objects.

00:30:15.860 --> 00:30:18.200
You can see though that
there are some stimuli here

00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:19.700
in the gadget
category, for example,

00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:21.991
that are eliciting responses
that are quite respectable

00:30:21.991 --> 00:30:23.090
relative to the faces.

00:30:23.090 --> 00:30:25.840
But really the biggest responses
recorded were to the faces.

00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:28.270
So then we color coded
this so you have a response

00:30:28.270 --> 00:30:31.060
vector of the sale, where red
is now symbolizing response

00:30:31.060 --> 00:30:33.070
enhancement and blue
is symbolizing response

00:30:33.070 --> 00:30:34.427
suppression below baseline.

00:30:34.427 --> 00:30:36.010
And the advantage
of using this format

00:30:36.010 --> 00:30:37.810
is you can now stick
all the responses you

00:30:37.810 --> 00:30:39.226
get from all the
cells that you're

00:30:39.226 --> 00:30:42.040
recording day after day after
day from this one face area.

00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:44.240
And you get a population
response matrix.

00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:46.700
And the way that this
works is cell numbers

00:30:46.700 --> 00:30:49.300
are organized from top to
bottom, page number from left

00:30:49.300 --> 00:30:50.170
to right.

00:30:50.170 --> 00:30:52.900
And you can see very quickly
that most of the cells

00:30:52.900 --> 00:30:55.930
here are either selectively
enhanced or selectively

00:30:55.930 --> 00:30:57.052
suppressed by faces.

00:30:57.052 --> 00:30:58.510
There's a small
group here between,

00:30:58.510 --> 00:31:00.520
something like 10% of
the cells, where it's not

00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:01.780
so clear what they are doing.

00:31:01.780 --> 00:31:03.747
But if you do the
population average,

00:31:03.747 --> 00:31:05.830
you can see much bigger
responses to all the faces

00:31:05.830 --> 00:31:07.870
rather than on face objects.

00:31:07.870 --> 00:31:10.570
If you look more closely, what
these pictures are eliciting

00:31:10.570 --> 00:31:12.740
in these intermediate
responses, these

00:31:12.740 --> 00:31:14.680
are like clock
faces, apples, pears,

00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:17.050
there are things that have
physical properties in common

00:31:17.050 --> 00:31:17.794
with faces.

00:31:17.794 --> 00:31:19.210
So you can kind
of fool the system

00:31:19.210 --> 00:31:20.950
to give a partial response.

00:31:20.950 --> 00:31:23.200
And this is one clue to what
this area might be doing.

00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:24.699
It should be doing
a visual analysis

00:31:24.699 --> 00:31:26.590
of the incoming stimuli
to try and figure out

00:31:26.590 --> 00:31:29.810
if these are faces are not.

00:31:29.810 --> 00:31:32.071
So these are cells in
the middle face patches.

00:31:32.071 --> 00:31:33.820
I was actually going
over this pretty fast

00:31:33.820 --> 00:31:36.200
but I'm going to use
this later quite a bit.

00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:37.450
And so let's wind back.

00:31:37.450 --> 00:31:41.710
We have one posterior area
here, to middle face areas,

00:31:41.710 --> 00:31:44.290
see the middle face patches,
and then three anterior ones.

00:31:44.290 --> 00:31:46.450
I'm mostly going to talk
about this one here, AL,

00:31:46.450 --> 00:31:48.210
and this one here, M, in
addition to the middle face

00:31:48.210 --> 00:31:48.710
patches.

00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:57.740
So we think that actually
this is another automatic face

00:31:57.740 --> 00:31:59.170
recognition feat.

00:31:59.170 --> 00:32:01.880
We can't stop feeling
sorry for these peppers.

00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:03.830
They've been just cut in half.

00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:05.340
And so they seem
to be screaming,

00:32:05.340 --> 00:32:08.030
and then you know
they are OK but still

00:32:08.030 --> 00:32:11.420
you feel like something
really bad just happened.

00:32:11.420 --> 00:32:15.410
And so we can't stop having
these inferences about peppers

00:32:15.410 --> 00:32:17.150
where they look like faces.

00:32:17.150 --> 00:32:19.780
And one reason could be that we
have this specialized circuitry

00:32:19.780 --> 00:32:21.740
that's just getting active
with right features,

00:32:21.740 --> 00:32:24.860
even if you know
these are not faces.

00:32:24.860 --> 00:32:28.202
OK so when the faces were
discovered by Charles Gross,

00:32:28.202 --> 00:32:29.910
this really fell on
very fertile grounds.

00:32:29.910 --> 00:32:32.156
And I should just discuss
some of the implications.

00:32:32.156 --> 00:32:33.530
So David Hubel
and Torsten Weisel

00:32:33.530 --> 00:32:36.980
just discovered a few years
before orientation selectivity.

00:32:36.980 --> 00:32:39.140
So it was a big jump
from early processing

00:32:39.140 --> 00:32:41.970
where I could see how
selectivity of cells

00:32:41.970 --> 00:32:43.550
was getting more complex.

00:32:43.550 --> 00:32:45.782
More concentric representations
to elongated ones,

00:32:45.782 --> 00:32:47.240
from simple cells
to complex cells,

00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:50.510
but complex cells are as
selective as simple cells

00:32:50.510 --> 00:32:52.220
but don't really have
a special location.

00:32:52.220 --> 00:32:54.620
All the way up to the opposite
end of the visual system

00:32:54.620 --> 00:32:57.050
and now you find a
face selective neuron.

00:32:57.050 --> 00:32:59.940
Jerome Lettvin just had
coined the term grandmother

00:32:59.940 --> 00:33:02.284
neuron which some of you
brought up yesterday.

00:33:02.284 --> 00:33:04.700
The idea is that there should
be one neuron in your brain,

00:33:04.700 --> 00:33:07.040
or this is the hypothetical
situation you came up with,

00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:09.290
one neuron in your the brain
that's firing if and only

00:33:09.290 --> 00:33:11.210
if you see your grandmother,
no matter what she's wearing,

00:33:11.210 --> 00:33:12.650
which direction you see from.

00:33:12.650 --> 00:33:14.630
That's the neural
correlate of you

00:33:14.630 --> 00:33:17.000
perceiving your grandmother
is the activity of this one

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:17.750
neuron.

00:33:17.750 --> 00:33:19.960
And there were other
concepts like Jerzy Konorski

00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:21.852
gnostic unit that
made the same point.

00:33:21.852 --> 00:33:23.810
Then Horace Barlow came
up with this idea maybe

00:33:23.810 --> 00:33:26.360
it's not one cell,
but multiple cells.

00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:27.920
But gave us a sparse
representation

00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:29.990
of pontifical
cells, a few of them

00:33:29.990 --> 00:33:31.820
at the top of a
processing hierarchy.

00:33:31.820 --> 00:33:33.612
And that's actually
how we recognize faces.

00:33:33.612 --> 00:33:36.111
And then of course there's the
opposite view of Donald Hebb.

00:33:36.111 --> 00:33:37.920
He talked about cell
assembly since there's

00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:40.760
no-- things are there like
large assembles] of cells.

00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:42.860
Or Karl Lashley who
talked about mass action

00:33:42.860 --> 00:33:44.360
and actually were
completely against

00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:45.944
functional specialization.

00:33:45.944 --> 00:33:47.360
If you look at a
plot like this, I

00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:49.235
think one of the things
you want to emphasize

00:33:49.235 --> 00:33:50.990
is that these cells
really don't fall

00:33:50.990 --> 00:33:52.300
into any of these categories.

00:33:52.300 --> 00:33:54.508
You can have cells that are
very, very face selective

00:33:54.508 --> 00:33:56.270
but they don't have
to be very sparse.

00:33:56.270 --> 00:33:58.160
They will appear sparse if
you poke them over and over

00:33:58.160 --> 00:33:59.820
and over with non-face
stimuli because they're not

00:33:59.820 --> 00:34:01.096
going to respond to those.

00:34:01.096 --> 00:34:02.720
But within the domain
of faces, they're

00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:05.814
going to respond to
pretty much all faces.

00:34:05.814 --> 00:34:07.980
There are differences between
these different cells.

00:34:07.980 --> 00:34:09.800
I'm going to come
back to that as well.

00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:11.550
But it's one example
where we can actually

00:34:11.550 --> 00:34:14.020
ask them these deep questions
about what is the neural code

00:34:14.020 --> 00:34:15.860
and quantitative
matter by focusing

00:34:15.860 --> 00:34:18.987
on the right stimulus and the
right place to look at it.

00:34:18.987 --> 00:34:21.320
So we have some evidence that
monkeys, like humans, have

00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:23.510
face regions, and
the monkey face

00:34:23.510 --> 00:34:26.810
patches appear to be dedicated
domain specific modules.

00:34:26.810 --> 00:34:28.370
The practical
implications of this

00:34:28.370 --> 00:34:30.650
is that now we have
unprecedented access

00:34:30.650 --> 00:34:32.570
to function homogeneous
populations of cells

00:34:32.570 --> 00:34:34.760
coding for one high
level object category.

00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:36.780
And we know this category,
we can make stimuli.

00:34:36.780 --> 00:34:38.690
And we can modify
the stimuli sometimes

00:34:38.690 --> 00:34:39.698
in parametric fashions.

00:34:39.698 --> 00:34:41.239
And so we can have
very deep insights

00:34:41.239 --> 00:34:43.572
into how these cells actually
are processing interfaces,

00:34:43.572 --> 00:34:46.100
how they are restricting
properties from these faces.

00:34:46.100 --> 00:34:49.130
And we can do causal
tests and actually show

00:34:49.130 --> 00:34:52.147
whether these cells are involved
in face recognition behavior.

00:34:52.147 --> 00:34:54.230
And we're just going to
go over this very quickly.

00:34:54.230 --> 00:34:56.477
This is work of
Srivatsun Sadagopan,

00:34:56.477 --> 00:34:58.310
he actually gave me
this picture of himself.

00:34:58.310 --> 00:35:01.280
This combines the front
view and a profile view.

00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:02.322
The logic is very simple.

00:35:02.322 --> 00:35:04.780
So we wanted to inactivate one
particular region in a male.

00:35:04.780 --> 00:35:06.920
I'm going to tell you
in a second why a male.

00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:08.780
While the monkey would
be engaged in a task

00:35:08.780 --> 00:35:11.071
like this where it is to find
a face in a visual scene.

00:35:11.071 --> 00:35:12.634
The visual scene
that we constructed

00:35:12.634 --> 00:35:13.550
looks a bit like this.

00:35:13.550 --> 00:35:15.216
It's displayed on a
touch screen monitor

00:35:15.216 --> 00:35:16.760
so the animal's
free to move around.

00:35:16.760 --> 00:35:18.259
It has to find the
face in the scene

00:35:18.259 --> 00:35:20.270
and the scene is
composed of a pink noise

00:35:20.270 --> 00:35:22.926
background embedded in which
there are 24 different objects.

00:35:22.926 --> 00:35:24.800
And the target object,
in this case the face,

00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:26.480
is going to be
varying in visibility

00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:28.460
across 10 different levels.

00:35:28.460 --> 00:35:31.657
We would have other tasks where
the monkey body was included,

00:35:31.657 --> 00:35:33.240
which you will not
be able to see here

00:35:33.240 --> 00:35:35.360
but there is a monkey
body here or the monkey

00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:37.580
was looking for a shoe.

00:35:37.580 --> 00:35:39.590
Then we would infuse
muscimol which

00:35:39.590 --> 00:35:42.407
is a pharmacological agent
that is inactivating cells

00:35:42.407 --> 00:35:44.240
along with a contrast
agent gadolinium which

00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:45.472
you can measure an MRI.

00:35:45.472 --> 00:35:47.680
And then this yellow region
here is the face area now

00:35:47.680 --> 00:35:49.763
and this white region is
the actual injection site

00:35:49.763 --> 00:35:50.780
that we used.

00:35:50.780 --> 00:35:53.460
And so this gives it a way for
every experiment to control,

00:35:53.460 --> 00:35:55.580
are we inside the face
area or are we outside.

00:35:55.580 --> 00:35:58.570
And we can use the outside
injections as controls.

00:35:58.570 --> 00:36:00.220
What's been found is shown here.

00:36:00.220 --> 00:36:01.900
So we have a psychometric curve.

00:36:01.900 --> 00:36:04.150
So in normal behavior you're
getting better and better

00:36:04.150 --> 00:36:09.770
at finding the face in the scene
as you increase its visibility.

00:36:09.770 --> 00:36:12.500
If you inactivate, you get
a reduced face detection

00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:14.180
behavior.

00:36:14.180 --> 00:36:18.290
I should emphasize that we only
inactivating one face area out

00:36:18.290 --> 00:36:19.610
of 12 in the temporal lobe.

00:36:19.610 --> 00:36:21.351
We are only activating
one hemisphere.

00:36:21.351 --> 00:36:22.850
And what Jim DiCarlo
was emphasizing

00:36:22.850 --> 00:36:25.590
yesterday this retinopathy
at this level of processing.

00:36:25.590 --> 00:36:27.710
So the animal can actually
use a scanning strategy

00:36:27.710 --> 00:36:31.280
to go one direction and
overcome this deficit.

00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:34.132
And so likely this effect
would be much stronger

00:36:34.132 --> 00:36:35.840
if we had inactivated
on both hemispheres

00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:38.260
or would have controlled
precisely for the eye movement.

00:36:38.260 --> 00:36:40.250
But we are here for
natural behavior.

00:36:40.250 --> 00:36:41.790
And the controls
of bodies and shoes

00:36:41.790 --> 00:36:43.040
are, there is no effect there.

00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:45.510
We put lots of controls and
we went to the next state

00:36:45.510 --> 00:36:46.570
of the behavior.

00:36:46.570 --> 00:36:48.480
We did the injections
outside as I mentioned,

00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:51.200
it's very specific for
inactivation inside the face

00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:54.970
area that the most basic of
face recognition abilities, face

00:36:54.970 --> 00:36:57.250
detection is impaired.

00:36:57.250 --> 00:36:59.422
And so there's a way
you might visualize it.

00:36:59.422 --> 00:37:00.880
So one way to
explain this behavior

00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:03.070
would be that the visibility
of a face like this

00:37:03.070 --> 00:37:04.552
would actually,
with an activation,

00:37:04.552 --> 00:37:06.010
look something like
this where it's

00:37:06.010 --> 00:37:09.867
going to be harder to detect.

00:37:09.867 --> 00:37:11.700
The second way we can
take advantage of this

00:37:11.700 --> 00:37:13.230
is that we have now access
to individual cells.

00:37:13.230 --> 00:37:14.813
We actually ask more
precise questions

00:37:14.813 --> 00:37:16.650
about how they're
processing faces.

00:37:16.650 --> 00:37:17.880
And actually there's
an activation study

00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:20.421
that was motivated by earlier
work we had done on selectivity

00:37:20.421 --> 00:37:22.380
of these cells for
features that should

00:37:22.380 --> 00:37:24.780
be relevant for face detection.

00:37:24.780 --> 00:37:26.280
This is what Shay
Ohayon did when he

00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:27.690
was a grad student with Doris.

00:37:27.690 --> 00:37:30.420
He's actually now a
post-doc with Jim.

00:37:30.420 --> 00:37:33.870
And again, the question is
how can you detect faces even

00:37:33.870 --> 00:37:35.980
when the lighting conditions
are very difficult.

00:37:35.980 --> 00:37:37.896
There's beautiful work
from Pavan Sinha that's

00:37:37.896 --> 00:37:39.719
emphasizing that
coarse, contrast

00:37:39.719 --> 00:37:41.760
relationships in the face
of very good heuristics

00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:42.730
to do that.

00:37:42.730 --> 00:37:44.790
The reason is that the
3D structure of our face

00:37:44.790 --> 00:37:46.956
stays the same even when
the lighting conditions are

00:37:46.956 --> 00:37:47.490
changing.

00:37:47.490 --> 00:37:49.530
And so no matter whether
light is shining from,

00:37:49.530 --> 00:37:51.420
typically the eye
regions because they're

00:37:51.420 --> 00:37:53.400
receded relative to
nose and forehead,

00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:54.817
are darker than
nose and forehead.

00:37:54.817 --> 00:37:56.775
And so he found that in
the human psychophysics

00:37:56.775 --> 00:37:59.010
you have 12 heuristics like
this, forehead brighter

00:37:59.010 --> 00:38:00.690
than left eye, forehead
brighter than right eye,

00:38:00.690 --> 00:38:02.731
nose brighter than mouth,
and so on and so forth.

00:38:02.731 --> 00:38:04.680
Twelve of these
characteristics that actually

00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:06.580
together can allow you
to detect the face.

00:38:06.580 --> 00:38:08.880
And in fact, your face
detector on your cell phone

00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:10.749
is using a very similar
strategy as well.

00:38:10.749 --> 00:38:12.790
Trying to find the coarse,
contrast relationships

00:38:12.790 --> 00:38:14.100
in the scene.

00:38:14.100 --> 00:38:16.680
So what Shay did was he
started with a real face,

00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:19.050
he would parse it into
11 parts, and then

00:38:19.050 --> 00:38:20.940
randomly assigned 11
different luminance

00:38:20.940 --> 00:38:25.230
values to these 11 different
parts and change this rapidly.

00:38:25.230 --> 00:38:27.149
And then the analysis
would look like this.

00:38:27.149 --> 00:38:29.190
So no matter what the
overall pattern looks like,

00:38:29.190 --> 00:38:31.380
he's going to look for
a particular contrast

00:38:31.380 --> 00:38:33.644
relationship with the
forehead versus the left eye.

00:38:33.644 --> 00:38:36.060
And he's going to ask is the
neuron responding differently

00:38:36.060 --> 00:38:38.143
in these conditions where
the forehead is brighter

00:38:38.143 --> 00:38:40.170
than the left eye versus
in these conditions

00:38:40.170 --> 00:38:42.990
where the left eye is brighter
than the left forehead.

00:38:42.990 --> 00:38:46.650
And you can do this for
all pairs of combinations

00:38:46.650 --> 00:38:48.390
of 11 different parts.

00:38:48.390 --> 00:38:50.940
And in these 55
different combinations,

00:38:50.940 --> 00:38:52.920
we can mark by
arrows the prediction

00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:54.430
from human phycophysics.

00:38:54.430 --> 00:38:57.270
So human psychophysics told
us 12 of these constrast pairs

00:38:57.270 --> 00:38:58.446
are going to be important.

00:38:58.446 --> 00:38:59.820
It also told us
what the polarity

00:38:59.820 --> 00:39:02.327
was that was going to be
important for detecting a face.

00:39:02.327 --> 00:39:04.410
Again, forehead brighter
than eye, or eye brighter

00:39:04.410 --> 00:39:06.380
than forehead.

00:39:06.380 --> 00:39:08.800
OK and this is what
we actually found.

00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:11.040
So what this shows is
a population diagram

00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:14.370
of all the cells that Shay found
and it was half of the cells

00:39:14.370 --> 00:39:17.120
that he recorded from that
showed some selectivity

00:39:17.120 --> 00:39:19.050
to some of these
contrast features

00:39:19.050 --> 00:39:21.060
and to some of these
contrast polarities.

00:39:21.060 --> 00:39:23.220
What's plotted here
upwards is for one contrast

00:39:23.220 --> 00:39:26.220
polarity and one
particular contrast pair,

00:39:26.220 --> 00:39:28.622
the number of cells he
found that were selective.

00:39:28.622 --> 00:39:30.330
And as you go through
the entire diagram,

00:39:30.330 --> 00:39:33.061
you see that there are only a
very few examples of contrast

00:39:33.061 --> 00:39:34.560
pairs where actually
different cells

00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:36.480
like different polarities.

00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:38.460
Like here for example
you have more than 60,

00:39:38.460 --> 00:39:40.920
70 cells that all like
one polarity and not

00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:43.110
a single one that likes
the opposite polarity.

00:39:43.110 --> 00:39:45.190
And this is true for
all these polarities.

00:39:45.190 --> 00:39:47.040
So it's a very
consistent pattern.

00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:50.700
Second, we can explain all the
human psychophysics preferences

00:39:50.700 --> 00:39:51.890
here.

00:39:51.890 --> 00:39:53.970
Not only that, these
are important dimensions

00:39:53.970 --> 00:39:54.979
for these cells.

00:39:54.979 --> 00:39:56.520
But in all these
cases the cells care

00:39:56.520 --> 00:39:58.936
for the exact same polarity
that they would have predicted

00:39:58.936 --> 00:40:00.000
from human psychophysics.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:02.550
In addition, there are other
contrast pairs that apparently

00:40:02.550 --> 00:40:04.470
don't matter this much
in human psychophysics,

00:40:04.470 --> 00:40:06.300
but these cells also care about.

00:40:06.300 --> 00:40:08.750
So they seem to be using these
coarse contrast features.

00:40:08.750 --> 00:40:10.834
And again, they're very
useful for face detection.

00:40:10.834 --> 00:40:13.333
Now we got the behavior that
we know that the areas involved

00:40:13.333 --> 00:40:14.970
in the face detection
with stimuli

00:40:14.970 --> 00:40:17.449
where it's actually hard
to make out the detail.

00:40:17.449 --> 00:40:18.990
Then Shay did a
control and I thought

00:40:18.990 --> 00:40:21.180
this was really the
coolest thing ever.

00:40:21.180 --> 00:40:22.930
He's a computer scientist
and so of course

00:40:22.930 --> 00:40:24.990
he knew about databases
and how to use them.

00:40:24.990 --> 00:40:26.531
And he would say,
OK, can we actually

00:40:26.531 --> 00:40:30.390
fool these cells into responding
to non-face stimuli that

00:40:30.390 --> 00:40:33.540
comply by the rules of this
coarse contrast of faces?

00:40:33.540 --> 00:40:36.630
So here are some examples.

00:40:36.630 --> 00:40:38.460
This is just a
pattern where there

00:40:38.460 --> 00:40:40.810
are some dark regions where
the human face eyes might be

00:40:40.810 --> 00:40:41.540
and so on and so forth.

00:40:41.540 --> 00:40:43.498
This is a pattern that
only has one of these 12

00:40:43.498 --> 00:40:44.620
contrasts correct.

00:40:44.620 --> 00:40:46.650
But also in human faces,
you can find some--

00:40:46.650 --> 00:40:48.732
when a person is
smiling, wearing glasses,

00:40:48.732 --> 00:40:50.190
most of this
contrasts are actually

00:40:50.190 --> 00:40:52.645
not in the face that
should be there.

00:40:52.645 --> 00:40:54.990
So there are some very contrast
correct faces and there

00:40:54.990 --> 00:40:57.962
are some faces that are not
very very contrast correct.

00:40:57.962 --> 00:40:59.670
And now you can ask
how does the response

00:40:59.670 --> 00:41:02.490
of the cells in the middle
face patch change as you are

00:41:02.490 --> 00:41:04.500
increasing the number
of correct contrasts,

00:41:04.500 --> 00:41:07.092
either on the face
or non-face stimuli.

00:41:07.092 --> 00:41:08.050
And the answer is this.

00:41:08.050 --> 00:41:10.620
If you increase the number
of contrasts in the face,

00:41:10.620 --> 00:41:12.294
the cells respond more and more.

00:41:12.294 --> 00:41:14.210
If you change the contrast
of non-face objects

00:41:14.210 --> 00:41:15.402
the cells don't care.

00:41:15.402 --> 00:41:17.360
So there is something
else that caused contrast

00:41:17.360 --> 00:41:19.235
that the cells care
about, they're not easily

00:41:19.235 --> 00:41:21.540
fooled to respond to
things that clearly

00:41:21.540 --> 00:41:25.890
aren't faces when the coarse
contrasts are correct.

00:41:25.890 --> 00:41:27.914
And we could actually
have predicted something

00:41:27.914 --> 00:41:29.830
like this should happen
from an earlier study.

00:41:29.830 --> 00:41:31.350
So the first study
we did where we

00:41:31.350 --> 00:41:33.810
took advantage of the fact
that in a face selective area

00:41:33.810 --> 00:41:36.120
we can record from faces
over and over again

00:41:36.120 --> 00:41:37.840
and that they have
similar properties

00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:40.440
was a study where we looked at
the effect of part and whole.

00:41:40.440 --> 00:41:42.975
This is one of the central
features in psychophysical

00:41:42.975 --> 00:41:45.930
of human faces is that you can
get information from the face

00:41:45.930 --> 00:41:48.600
without any detail just
from the gist of the face.

00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:50.940
An example is again
from Pavan Sinha.

00:41:50.940 --> 00:41:54.270
If you have a blurred face
of a familiar individual,

00:41:54.270 --> 00:41:57.391
like some of you might
recognize Woody Allen here,

00:41:57.391 --> 00:41:59.640
of course with the glasses
it's a little bit cheating,

00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:01.290
but you can recognize him.

00:42:01.290 --> 00:42:02.970
And the other
examples in the study

00:42:02.970 --> 00:42:04.530
were people who
don't wear glasses,

00:42:04.530 --> 00:42:06.630
so you can recognize a famous
face just from the gist of it.

00:42:06.630 --> 00:42:07.880
You don't need the details.

00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:09.630
On the other hand, we
can process details.

00:42:09.630 --> 00:42:11.310
We can focus on details.

00:42:11.310 --> 00:42:14.880
And so how do these two
things relate to each other?

00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:18.360
What we did was we
constructed a face space,

00:42:18.360 --> 00:42:21.210
a cartoon face space, based
on very, very simple geometric

00:42:21.210 --> 00:42:21.930
shapes.

00:42:21.930 --> 00:42:24.310
So these faces are just made
out of ovals, and triangles,

00:42:24.310 --> 00:42:25.080
and lines.

00:42:25.080 --> 00:42:27.760
So very simple geometric shapes.

00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:30.390
But if they are put together
they actually look like faces.

00:42:30.390 --> 00:42:32.139
Now we can parameterize
this face space,

00:42:32.139 --> 00:42:33.430
we can vary certain parameters.

00:42:33.430 --> 00:42:37.070
So we had faces that
change in aspect ratio.

00:42:37.070 --> 00:42:40.230
They go from Sesame
character Ernie here to Bert.

00:42:40.230 --> 00:42:44.100
We have pupil size, like no
pupil here, very big pupils.

00:42:44.100 --> 00:42:46.060
We have inter-eye distance here.

00:42:46.060 --> 00:42:49.440
So these eyes are close together
almost like cyclopian fashion

00:42:49.440 --> 00:42:52.070
or they can be very far
apart from each other,

00:42:52.070 --> 00:42:55.450
stretching the outside of the
face and so on and so forth.

00:42:55.450 --> 00:42:57.694
And we would now randomly
change these features,

00:42:57.694 --> 00:42:59.360
all these different
features dimensions,

00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:01.819
randomly choosing a new value
every time we show this face.

00:43:01.819 --> 00:43:03.443
It looks a bit like
a cartoon character

00:43:03.443 --> 00:43:04.809
who is trying to talk to you.

00:43:04.809 --> 00:43:06.600
But the way we analyze
this is very simple.

00:43:06.600 --> 00:43:09.270
So we just asked no matter
what these other features are,

00:43:09.270 --> 00:43:11.330
for the first feature
dimension mention does

00:43:11.330 --> 00:43:13.830
the firing of the cell change
as we're changing this feature

00:43:13.830 --> 00:43:14.380
dimension.

00:43:14.380 --> 00:43:15.630
Then we asked this for
the second dimension,

00:43:15.630 --> 00:43:18.005
the third dimension, and so
on and so forth for all these

00:43:18.005 --> 00:43:19.410
slightly different dimensions.

00:43:19.410 --> 00:43:21.840
What we found is shown
here for one example cell.

00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:23.954
So we had 19 different
tuning curves.

00:43:23.954 --> 00:43:25.620
And of these 19
different tuning curves,

00:43:25.620 --> 00:43:27.422
for four are
significantly tuned.

00:43:27.422 --> 00:43:29.880
For this particular cell it
was face aspect ratio so didn't

00:43:29.880 --> 00:43:31.062
like Ernie, it liked Bert.

00:43:31.062 --> 00:43:33.270
It liked the eyes very close
together, not far apart.

00:43:33.270 --> 00:43:36.120
It likes the eyes a little
bit narrow, not wide.

00:43:36.120 --> 00:43:38.252
And it liked big
irises, not small ones.

00:43:38.252 --> 00:43:39.960
What's very typical
for how the cells are

00:43:39.960 --> 00:43:42.810
processing these features are
these ram shaped tuning curves.

00:43:42.810 --> 00:43:45.750
So more than 2/3 of the tuning
curves have this ramp shape.

00:43:45.750 --> 00:43:48.282
Which means that these cells
are relaying the information

00:43:48.282 --> 00:43:50.490
that they are measuring
almost in one to one fashion.

00:43:53.500 --> 00:43:55.590
This is not what the
cells are actually doing.

00:43:55.590 --> 00:43:57.030
It's just a metaphor.

00:43:57.030 --> 00:43:59.280
But it's almost like they're
taking a ruler, measuring

00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:00.696
eye distance, and
they're relaying

00:44:00.696 --> 00:44:03.900
this feature in almost one to
one fashion in their output.

00:44:03.900 --> 00:44:07.320
Another implication is that
most of your coding capacity

00:44:07.320 --> 00:44:09.522
is actually at the extremes
because many cells have

00:44:09.522 --> 00:44:11.730
big responses there, many
cells have small responses.

00:44:11.730 --> 00:44:13.630
So most of the
capacity is there.

00:44:13.630 --> 00:44:15.390
That's the range where
caricatures live.

00:44:15.390 --> 00:44:17.940
And oftentimes we are better
able to recognize individuals

00:44:17.940 --> 00:44:21.950
based on caricatures than
the individuals themselves.

00:44:21.950 --> 00:44:23.640
So in the middle
the face patches,

00:44:23.640 --> 00:44:26.181
they're causally and selectively
relevant for face detection.

00:44:26.181 --> 00:44:27.990
The cells are virtually
all face selective.

00:44:27.990 --> 00:44:30.030
Based on these two findings
we actually suggest

00:44:30.030 --> 00:44:33.000
and it's a little like Nancy
said as a strong signal

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:35.989
you're putting out that you
get backlash if there is.

00:44:35.989 --> 00:44:37.530
So we do think that
there are modules

00:44:37.530 --> 00:44:39.780
that are there for face
processing and face processing

00:44:39.780 --> 00:44:40.585
only.

00:44:40.585 --> 00:44:42.960
The gain of the tuning curve
is modulated by the presence

00:44:42.960 --> 00:44:44.320
of the entire face.

00:44:44.320 --> 00:44:46.741
There's this ramp shaped
tuning, which is very useful.

00:44:46.741 --> 00:44:48.990
The cells are sensitive to
contrast relations which is

00:44:48.990 --> 00:44:51.700
very useful for face detection.

00:44:51.700 --> 00:44:55.060
So we can really get
mechanistic about understanding

00:44:55.060 --> 00:44:55.860
face recognition.

00:44:55.860 --> 00:44:57.330
It's not just that we
can say, OK, these cells

00:44:57.330 --> 00:44:58.830
are responding more
to faces but we

00:44:58.830 --> 00:45:00.871
can say why they're
responding more to some faces

00:45:00.871 --> 00:45:01.780
than to others.

00:45:01.780 --> 00:45:03.821
In fact, you can predict
from the cartoon results

00:45:03.821 --> 00:45:07.200
how the cells are responding
to pictures of actual people

00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:09.064
with the very fine
details physically.

00:45:09.064 --> 00:45:10.980
And so at the level of
the middle face patches

00:45:10.980 --> 00:45:12.060
we already have some
of the requirements

00:45:12.060 --> 00:45:13.232
for face recognition system.

00:45:13.232 --> 00:45:14.940
So we have mechanisms
for face detection,

00:45:14.940 --> 00:45:16.860
we have some encoding
of facial features,

00:45:16.860 --> 00:45:18.832
and we have encoding
of configurations.

00:45:21.810 --> 00:45:23.362
Nancy said I should
talk about this.

00:45:23.362 --> 00:45:24.570
I'm going to talk about this.

00:45:24.570 --> 00:45:29.025
Sebastian Miller was a wonderful
grad student with Doris and me.

00:45:29.025 --> 00:45:30.400
He asked the
following questions.

00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:32.996
So whether the face pictures are
related to each other or not.

00:45:32.996 --> 00:45:34.620
If you look at the
overall organization

00:45:34.620 --> 00:45:37.420
these face errors are very
far apart from each other.

00:45:37.420 --> 00:45:39.170
So the most posterior
to the most anterior

00:45:39.170 --> 00:45:41.336
is one inch apart, it's a
third of the entire extent

00:45:41.336 --> 00:45:42.271
of the primate brain.

00:45:42.271 --> 00:45:44.520
They live in different
cytoarchitectonic environments.

00:45:44.520 --> 00:45:46.728
So you could also imagine
that maybe the connectivity

00:45:46.728 --> 00:45:47.842
is mostly local.

00:45:47.842 --> 00:45:49.800
On the other hand, they
are interested in faces

00:45:49.800 --> 00:45:51.510
and so you would
imagine that maybe there

00:45:51.510 --> 00:45:54.084
are specialized
connections between them.

00:45:54.084 --> 00:45:56.250
The way we addressed this
was with micro stimulation

00:45:56.250 --> 00:45:57.041
inside the scanner.

00:45:57.041 --> 00:45:58.950
So we would first
image the face areas.

00:45:58.950 --> 00:46:02.570
We would then lower an electrode
to one of the face areas here,

00:46:02.570 --> 00:46:05.220
we record from cells to make
sure it's face selective,

00:46:05.220 --> 00:46:07.110
but then we would
use this electrode

00:46:07.110 --> 00:46:09.107
to pass a current through
inside the scanner.

00:46:09.107 --> 00:46:10.690
Passing a current
through an electrode

00:46:10.690 --> 00:46:11.760
is going to activate cells.

00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:14.218
That in turn is going to change
blood flow and oxygenation.

00:46:14.218 --> 00:46:16.000
So things we can pick
up on the scanner.

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:18.541
And so yes, if this worked you
should get a swath of activity

00:46:18.541 --> 00:46:19.980
around your simulation site.

00:46:19.980 --> 00:46:21.930
But if these cells at
your stimulation site

00:46:21.930 --> 00:46:24.554
have predictions that are strong
and focal enough to drive down

00:46:24.554 --> 00:46:26.670
some neurons, you might
also find activation

00:46:26.670 --> 00:46:29.190
that spatially remote
locations and they can then

00:46:29.190 --> 00:46:32.742
see where these locations are
related to the face areas.

00:46:32.742 --> 00:46:34.200
So here is a computer
flattened map

00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:36.990
of the brain of one
macaque monkeys.

00:46:36.990 --> 00:46:39.360
The green areas
indicate by outline

00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:41.070
the extent of the face areas.

00:46:41.070 --> 00:46:42.510
We placed our
simulation electrode

00:46:42.510 --> 00:46:43.992
in one of the face
areas and this

00:46:43.992 --> 00:46:45.700
is the map we got from
micro stimulation,

00:46:45.700 --> 00:46:46.876
versus no micro stimulation.

00:46:46.876 --> 00:46:48.750
So there's no visual
stimulus there, actually

00:46:48.750 --> 00:46:51.090
that works during sleep
during complete darkness.

00:46:51.090 --> 00:46:52.560
So yes, we get a
swath of activity

00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:54.120
around the stimulation
site, and we

00:46:54.120 --> 00:46:57.385
get multiple spatially disjunct
regions that are activated.

00:46:57.385 --> 00:46:59.010
So they're strongly
driven by the cells

00:46:59.010 --> 00:47:02.464
in this region and these
overlap with the face areas.

00:47:02.464 --> 00:47:04.380
And this was either be
found very consistently

00:47:04.380 --> 00:47:06.630
across different phase areas
if you stimulated outside

00:47:06.630 --> 00:47:08.760
you also got this patchy
pattern of connectivity,

00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:11.155
but now it's outside
of the face system.

00:47:11.155 --> 00:47:12.780
And so this is the
picture that we got.

00:47:12.780 --> 00:47:14.488
Is that yes these face
areas are actually

00:47:14.488 --> 00:47:17.970
part of a network of face
areas that are strongly

00:47:17.970 --> 00:47:19.330
interconnected with each other.

00:47:19.330 --> 00:47:21.580
There's now data from
retrograde tracer studies,

00:47:21.580 --> 00:47:23.670
we find that 90% of
the cell bodies that

00:47:23.670 --> 00:47:26.530
are labeled after an
injection inside a face area

00:47:26.530 --> 00:47:29.740
are inside other face areas
or in the same face areas.

00:47:29.740 --> 00:47:33.150
So it's a surprisingly
anatomically specialized

00:47:33.150 --> 00:47:35.310
and closed network.

00:47:35.310 --> 00:47:37.560
So what's happening
in these areas,

00:47:37.560 --> 00:47:40.540
and again, my movie
isn't going to work.

00:47:40.540 --> 00:47:44.461
So in this area AL was more
anterior, also virtually

00:47:44.461 --> 00:47:45.960
all of the cells
are face selective.

00:47:45.960 --> 00:47:47.668
But you have a property
emerge here which

00:47:47.668 --> 00:47:48.670
you didn't have before.

00:47:48.670 --> 00:47:50.040
And that is mere
symmetric confusion.

00:47:50.040 --> 00:47:51.270
And it's something
that we did not expect.

00:47:51.270 --> 00:47:52.770
We're still puzzled by it.

00:47:52.770 --> 00:47:56.456
We have no explanation
why it's happening.

00:47:56.456 --> 00:47:58.830
But in this area you have
cells that like a profile view.

00:47:58.830 --> 00:48:00.390
And if they like
one profile view,

00:48:00.390 --> 00:48:02.265
they also like the
opposite profile view.

00:48:02.265 --> 00:48:04.140
And this region here as
I mentioned initially

00:48:04.140 --> 00:48:06.485
that some of the cells
did not really seem to be

00:48:06.485 --> 00:48:07.110
face selective.

00:48:07.110 --> 00:48:08.280
It's a small percentage.

00:48:08.280 --> 00:48:10.885
But actually these cells are
selective for facial profile.

00:48:10.885 --> 00:48:13.260
But if they like one profile
right, they don't like left.

00:48:13.260 --> 00:48:14.968
If they like left,
they don't like right.

00:48:14.968 --> 00:48:17.620
In AL, this is being confused.

00:48:17.620 --> 00:48:19.620
And then if you go
to AM, you have cells

00:48:19.620 --> 00:48:21.245
that respond to all faces.

00:48:21.245 --> 00:48:22.620
It doesn't matter
where they are,

00:48:22.620 --> 00:48:24.119
doesn't matter who
they are, doesn't

00:48:24.119 --> 00:48:25.910
matter how big they are.

00:48:25.910 --> 00:48:29.650
And the other cells that also
don't care where they are

00:48:29.650 --> 00:48:32.130
and how big they are,
but they care exquisitely

00:48:32.130 --> 00:48:33.517
about identity.

00:48:33.517 --> 00:48:35.100
So they can be very,
very finely tuned

00:48:35.100 --> 00:48:37.680
to identity in
particular to people

00:48:37.680 --> 00:48:39.750
that the animals never
see in real life.

00:48:39.750 --> 00:48:42.060
So there seems to be a
computation going on from here

00:48:42.060 --> 00:48:48.390
to here where in Jim
DiCarlo's conceptual framework

00:48:48.390 --> 00:48:51.330
you could imagine that there's
a manifold that's now becoming

00:48:51.330 --> 00:48:55.020
sort of flatter and more like
a more explicit representation.

00:48:55.020 --> 00:48:56.520
And for some reason
creating this

00:48:56.520 --> 00:48:59.439
has to go through this
mirror symmetric confusion.

00:48:59.439 --> 00:49:00.480
I just want to highlight.

00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:02.195
So we meant to touch
upon the question

00:49:02.195 --> 00:49:04.320
whether a face area should
do different coputations

00:49:04.320 --> 00:49:06.090
from non-face areas.

00:49:06.090 --> 00:49:07.590
Actually, my
intuition about this

00:49:07.590 --> 00:49:09.100
was actually quite the opposite.

00:49:09.100 --> 00:49:11.350
So I thought they would
likely do the same computation

00:49:11.350 --> 00:49:12.766
or hopefully the
same computations

00:49:12.766 --> 00:49:15.500
as outside the areas just
in different material.

00:49:15.500 --> 00:49:16.792
So why in other non-face areas?

00:49:16.792 --> 00:49:18.374
Why don't you want
to mix these cells?

00:49:18.374 --> 00:49:20.460
We have one study that's
a little too complicated

00:49:20.460 --> 00:49:22.532
to explain here that
gives some clues.

00:49:22.532 --> 00:49:24.240
But some computation
work from Joel Leibo

00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:25.823
was a grad student
with Tommy actually

00:49:25.823 --> 00:49:27.180
gave some clues to that.

00:49:27.180 --> 00:49:30.840
So Joel and Tommy were
thinking about invariance.

00:49:30.840 --> 00:49:32.370
And Tommy told me
he's going to talk

00:49:32.370 --> 00:49:35.520
about this at some later
point in the course.

00:49:35.520 --> 00:49:37.590
The different kinds of
transformations, easy ones

00:49:37.590 --> 00:49:38.430
and difficult ones.

00:49:38.430 --> 00:49:41.010
The easy ones are
affine transformations.

00:49:41.010 --> 00:49:44.430
We're just shifting something
in space or in size,

00:49:44.430 --> 00:49:45.990
or we rotate it in plane.

00:49:45.990 --> 00:49:47.982
And so if you learn
how to correct

00:49:47.982 --> 00:49:50.190
for this transformation for
just three dots of light,

00:49:50.190 --> 00:49:52.320
you can look for any image
that you can ever see.

00:49:52.320 --> 00:49:53.470
So this is relatively easy.

00:49:53.470 --> 00:49:55.470
But then they're non-affine
transformations that

00:49:55.470 --> 00:49:56.845
are actually
changing the picture

00:49:56.845 --> 00:49:58.560
and they are very
difficult. So if you

00:49:58.560 --> 00:50:00.730
change your facial
expression for example,

00:50:00.730 --> 00:50:02.370
or if lighting
conditions are changing,

00:50:02.370 --> 00:50:05.231
or if you're turning
your head in depth,

00:50:05.231 --> 00:50:06.730
this is a non-affine
transformation.

00:50:06.730 --> 00:50:08.736
So it's not predictable
from just three dots.

00:50:08.736 --> 00:50:10.110
And you can learn
something there

00:50:10.110 --> 00:50:13.020
that could tell you
how this picture would

00:50:13.020 --> 00:50:15.030
look like under this
non-affine transformation.

00:50:15.030 --> 00:50:17.040
And one of the insights from
Joel was that if you learn this

00:50:17.040 --> 00:50:19.610
non-affine transformation on
a particular object category--

00:50:19.610 --> 00:50:20.700
let's say faces--

00:50:20.700 --> 00:50:22.949
you actually have learned
nothing about another object

00:50:22.949 --> 00:50:24.720
category like cars.

00:50:24.720 --> 00:50:26.352
That's actually quite
surprising to me

00:50:26.352 --> 00:50:27.810
but there could be
a reason why you

00:50:27.810 --> 00:50:29.351
might want to have
all the cells that

00:50:29.351 --> 00:50:31.890
have to learn representations
across one transformation put

00:50:31.890 --> 00:50:34.884
them all in one location.

00:50:34.884 --> 00:50:36.300
The second insight
they had, and I

00:50:36.300 --> 00:50:38.490
think it's still
very surprising to me

00:50:38.490 --> 00:50:40.120
that it actually
works so easily,

00:50:40.120 --> 00:50:42.630
is to give the computation
a count for the system

00:50:42.630 --> 00:50:44.880
that I just described to
you in qualitative terms.

00:50:44.880 --> 00:50:47.620
So we have three
levels of processing.

00:50:47.620 --> 00:50:49.530
So we have a front
end where cells

00:50:49.530 --> 00:50:51.360
are useful for face
detection, they're

00:50:51.360 --> 00:50:52.860
all very face selective.

00:50:52.860 --> 00:50:55.560
So you could think of this
like a three level processing

00:50:55.560 --> 00:50:58.800
hierarchy where the level one
is like a face filter that's

00:50:58.800 --> 00:51:01.590
just going to tell you
it's their face or not.

00:51:01.590 --> 00:51:03.450
The top level you want
an identification.

00:51:03.450 --> 00:51:04.650
And I didn't show
the examples, again

00:51:04.650 --> 00:51:06.390
I hope with a connection
to the monitor I

00:51:06.390 --> 00:51:07.804
can show you the actual movies.

00:51:07.804 --> 00:51:09.720
You have some cells that
are very, very finely

00:51:09.720 --> 00:51:11.322
selective of facial identity.

00:51:11.322 --> 00:51:12.780
With pattern readout
techniques you

00:51:12.780 --> 00:51:17.149
can read out identity
extremely reliably.

00:51:17.149 --> 00:51:18.940
If you now have like
Hebbian Learning Rule,

00:51:18.940 --> 00:51:20.940
maybe Tommy is going to
explain this to you more,

00:51:20.940 --> 00:51:22.606
you actually get
something pretty magic.

00:51:22.606 --> 00:51:24.976
So you do get invariance
at level number three,

00:51:24.976 --> 00:51:27.600
which is kind of what you wanted
and might not be surprised by.

00:51:27.600 --> 00:51:29.724
But as a byproduct, you
are getting mirror symmetry

00:51:29.724 --> 00:51:30.402
at level two.

00:51:30.402 --> 00:51:32.610
And that's something you
didn't stick into the system

00:51:32.610 --> 00:51:34.674
and it just happens,
not like magic,

00:51:34.674 --> 00:51:36.090
but there's an
explanation for why

00:51:36.090 --> 00:51:38.310
this happens, out of
very general assumptions

00:51:38.310 --> 00:51:39.670
about the system.

00:51:39.670 --> 00:51:41.520
So the point I
want to make here,

00:51:41.520 --> 00:51:43.200
this particular
model could be wrong,

00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:45.927
but it's something about
how knowing something

00:51:45.927 --> 00:51:47.760
about the overall
organization of the system

00:51:47.760 --> 00:51:51.644
might actually reveal underlying
relationships that you

00:51:51.644 --> 00:51:52.560
might not think about.

00:51:52.560 --> 00:51:54.240
So the fact that there are
three levels of processing

00:51:54.240 --> 00:51:56.430
and not four or five
or six might actually

00:51:56.430 --> 00:51:58.389
impact whether you find
mirror symmetry or not.

00:51:58.389 --> 00:51:59.846
Or whether you find
mirrir symmetry

00:51:59.846 --> 00:52:01.110
at one level or another level.

00:52:01.110 --> 00:52:04.380
And you don't necessarily
get this automatically.

00:52:04.380 --> 00:52:07.140
Just put any processing
system together.

00:52:07.140 --> 00:52:09.180
Becuase I was mentioning
a facial motion,

00:52:09.180 --> 00:52:12.810
I would like to give a
brief vignette of that.

00:52:12.810 --> 00:52:17.115
And so I was emphasizing
here transformations

00:52:17.115 --> 00:52:17.990
along this direction.

00:52:17.990 --> 00:52:20.640
But you can see that at least
two levels of processing

00:52:20.640 --> 00:52:22.710
there are actually
two face areas here,

00:52:22.710 --> 00:52:25.240
one lateral to the STS, and
the other one deep inside.

00:52:25.240 --> 00:52:27.739
And so one of the questions we
had was what's going on here?

00:52:27.739 --> 00:52:29.110
How are they different?

00:52:29.110 --> 00:52:31.740
And so one way you
might think about this

00:52:31.740 --> 00:52:34.060
is again, connecting faces
to social perception.

00:52:34.060 --> 00:52:35.697
So there are some
faces out there

00:52:35.697 --> 00:52:36.780
that are not really faces.

00:52:36.780 --> 00:52:39.074
And so the faces of dolls
are just one example.

00:52:39.074 --> 00:52:41.115
So physically they are
faces but you can actually

00:52:41.115 --> 00:52:43.899
tell that they are not
really real, they're agents.

00:52:43.899 --> 00:52:46.440
And people like Thalia Wheatley
are wondering about questions

00:52:46.440 --> 00:52:47.940
like why dolls are creepy.

00:52:47.940 --> 00:52:51.120
So there is an
expectation that the face

00:52:51.120 --> 00:52:52.604
should belong to a real agent.

00:52:52.604 --> 00:52:54.770
And there are different
clues that can give it away.

00:52:54.770 --> 00:52:56.728
So if the face is on top
of a body, more likely

00:52:56.728 --> 00:52:59.190
it's an agent just like
an artificial stimulus.

00:52:59.190 --> 00:53:02.110
If a face is moving that's
another clue it's an agent.

00:53:02.110 --> 00:53:03.540
And this will
change fundamentally

00:53:03.540 --> 00:53:05.010
how you interacting with it.

00:53:05.010 --> 00:53:06.676
Your interaction with
the doll is likely

00:53:06.676 --> 00:53:08.720
going to be very different
than with a baby.

00:53:08.720 --> 00:53:10.365
And so again, objects
and their meaning

00:53:10.365 --> 00:53:12.240
are making them actionable
in different ways.

00:53:12.240 --> 00:53:13.860
And we have to understand what
the circuits are that actually

00:53:13.860 --> 00:53:15.222
make this possible.

00:53:15.222 --> 00:53:16.680
So one way to look
at this again is

00:53:16.680 --> 00:53:17.900
to think about these
facial displays.

00:53:17.900 --> 00:53:19.792
I showed the Tonkin
macaques and Clark

00:53:19.792 --> 00:53:22.230
Fisher was an M.D. PhD student
in the lab was actually

00:53:22.230 --> 00:53:23.850
addressing this question.

00:53:23.850 --> 00:53:25.730
And so he made movies
like this one here.

00:53:25.730 --> 00:53:29.070
Luckily there's no sound so
we can actually play them.

00:53:29.070 --> 00:53:31.170
These are movies of
macaque monkeys making

00:53:31.170 --> 00:53:33.170
facial movements of
all different kinds

00:53:33.170 --> 00:53:34.701
of facial expressions.

00:53:34.701 --> 00:53:36.450
And we then also have
stills that are just

00:53:36.450 --> 00:53:38.177
changing from time to time.

00:53:38.177 --> 00:53:40.260
And we have controls of
toys that the animals also

00:53:40.260 --> 00:53:42.000
know that are either
moving or that

00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:44.242
are jumping every second
from one state to the other.

00:53:44.242 --> 00:53:46.200
And we would ask as we
had in an earlier study,

00:53:46.200 --> 00:53:48.330
are these areas
responding to this motion

00:53:48.330 --> 00:53:52.101
differently than to
the static images.

00:53:52.101 --> 00:53:53.100
So here's what he found.

00:53:53.100 --> 00:53:55.450
So he had six different face
areas he was looking at.

00:53:55.450 --> 00:53:57.284
If you're looking at
static form selectivity

00:53:57.284 --> 00:53:59.741
we're just reproducing the way
that the area was found just

00:53:59.741 --> 00:54:01.000
with a different stimulus.

00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:03.720
So all the six areas respond
more to faces than to objects.

00:54:03.720 --> 00:54:06.774
If we now compare moving
faces to static faces,

00:54:06.774 --> 00:54:08.190
all the arrows are
responding more

00:54:08.190 --> 00:54:10.050
to the moving faces
than the static ones.

00:54:10.050 --> 00:54:12.630
Some quantitative differences,
but overall the same pattern,

00:54:12.630 --> 00:54:15.222
more responsive to moving
than static stimuli.

00:54:15.222 --> 00:54:17.430
If you now compare on the
right inside the modulation

00:54:17.430 --> 00:54:19.140
by moving objects
through static objects.

00:54:19.140 --> 00:54:21.902
You can see that also all
the areas or almost all

00:54:21.902 --> 00:54:23.610
have a slight advantage
of moving objects

00:54:23.610 --> 00:54:25.140
over static objects.

00:54:25.140 --> 00:54:28.440
There seems to be a general
motion sensitivity there.

00:54:28.440 --> 00:54:31.624
But if you do the interaction
of shape and motion,

00:54:31.624 --> 00:54:33.540
you can see that all the
areas are selectively

00:54:33.540 --> 00:54:38.520
more enhanced by face motion
than by non-face motion.

00:54:38.520 --> 00:54:40.909
But they all look
pretty similar.

00:54:40.909 --> 00:54:42.450
So now you can
actually wonder if you

00:54:42.450 --> 00:54:44.850
have a contrast like this,
like moving versus still,

00:54:44.850 --> 00:54:46.780
there a couple of things
that are different.

00:54:46.780 --> 00:54:50.207
So is it really about motion or
is it just about the content?

00:54:50.207 --> 00:54:52.540
If you just show a picture
every one second you can say,

00:54:52.540 --> 00:54:54.060
well, there's less
content there,

00:54:54.060 --> 00:54:56.185
therefore you might have
more adaptation, therefore

00:54:56.185 --> 00:54:57.640
less response across the board.

00:54:57.640 --> 00:54:59.250
Is it about update frequency?

00:54:59.250 --> 00:55:02.250
You know, a fast update
versus a slow update.

00:55:02.250 --> 00:55:09.867
So what Clark did, he was
creating another stimulus.

00:55:09.867 --> 00:55:11.700
If you think about
creepiness, it's actually

00:55:11.700 --> 00:55:12.780
like a little bit creepy.

00:55:12.780 --> 00:55:16.150
So like a scrambled version
of a motion that's shown here.

00:55:16.150 --> 00:55:18.750
Shows us the same frames of
the movie but just randomly

00:55:18.750 --> 00:55:19.876
associated with each other.

00:55:19.876 --> 00:55:22.000
So if anything, now the
motion energy in this thing

00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:23.579
is higher than in this one here.

00:55:23.579 --> 00:55:25.620
And we can look now for
the contrast of those two

00:55:25.620 --> 00:55:28.715
and also the contrast
through here.

00:55:28.715 --> 00:55:30.090
And now what he
finds is actually

00:55:30.090 --> 00:55:33.120
something where the face areas
are qualitatively different.

00:55:33.120 --> 00:55:35.430
He finds two face
areas here which

00:55:35.430 --> 00:55:37.320
are responding more
to the natural motion

00:55:37.320 --> 00:55:39.670
than unscrambled motion,
and three face areas

00:55:39.670 --> 00:55:41.670
that are responding more
to the scrambled motion

00:55:41.670 --> 00:55:43.080
than the natural motion.

00:55:43.080 --> 00:55:45.300
So they shift
opposite preferences.

00:55:45.300 --> 00:55:47.040
What we think is
going in the areas

00:55:47.040 --> 00:55:49.950
here that remember also the
benefit for facial motion

00:55:49.950 --> 00:55:52.260
over static faces,
that they just

00:55:52.260 --> 00:55:53.914
like a fast update of content.

00:55:53.914 --> 00:55:55.580
Ideally in a way
that's not predictable.

00:55:55.580 --> 00:55:57.120
If you show me something
new I'm going to respond.

00:55:57.120 --> 00:55:59.520
And if it's something that
I can't predict even better.

00:55:59.520 --> 00:56:00.670
So this is what
these guys are doing.

00:56:00.670 --> 00:56:02.280
But these ones here,
they seem to be

00:56:02.280 --> 00:56:04.410
really sensitive to facial
movement and naturalness

00:56:04.410 --> 00:56:05.860
of facial movement.

00:56:05.860 --> 00:56:09.160
And that was not smart.

00:56:09.160 --> 00:56:11.820
And these areas are located
more deep inside the STS,

00:56:11.820 --> 00:56:15.760
more dorsally, and these areas
are located more ventrally.

00:56:15.760 --> 00:56:18.075
So there's an organization
and to discover the new face

00:56:18.075 --> 00:56:19.283
area they didn't know before.

00:56:19.283 --> 00:56:22.380
It's a seventh face area which
he called MD which is really

00:56:22.380 --> 00:56:23.899
like a face motion area.

00:56:23.899 --> 00:56:26.190
There are lots of reasons
why we're excited about this.

00:56:26.190 --> 00:56:29.310
I mentioned the link between
face perception and agency

00:56:29.310 --> 00:56:29.970
interpretation.

00:56:29.970 --> 00:56:33.540
This is one possible
link, there are more.

00:56:33.540 --> 00:56:35.480
It might be a second
phase processing system,

00:56:35.480 --> 00:56:37.290
I'm going to go through
all the evidence.

00:56:37.290 --> 00:56:39.539
It's only indirect, though
that this area might not

00:56:39.539 --> 00:56:40.830
be connected to the other ones.

00:56:40.830 --> 00:56:43.205
I told you before that the
six face areas are intricately

00:56:43.205 --> 00:56:44.820
integrated to be one network.

00:56:44.820 --> 00:56:47.430
This area never showed
up in stimulation,

00:56:47.430 --> 00:56:48.722
therefore it might be separate.

00:56:48.722 --> 00:56:50.888
And this is kind of nice
because it fits very nicely

00:56:50.888 --> 00:56:51.870
to the human situation.

00:56:51.870 --> 00:56:54.660
So in the human brain you
have the posterior STS face

00:56:54.660 --> 00:56:57.600
area which is exquisitely
sensitive to facial motion.

00:56:57.600 --> 00:57:00.160
Actually you often don't
even get it for static faces.

00:57:00.160 --> 00:57:01.830
But it's very sensitive
to facial motion

00:57:01.830 --> 00:57:03.960
and actually Nancy has a
beautiful study on that.

00:57:03.960 --> 00:57:05.730
And this area by
several accounts

00:57:05.730 --> 00:57:07.620
is not like the other face area.

00:57:07.620 --> 00:57:10.630
So it seems to be
like a specialization.

00:57:10.630 --> 00:57:12.430
That's another
thing, another reason

00:57:12.430 --> 00:57:16.966
why we think these systems might
be connected to each other.

00:57:16.966 --> 00:57:18.340
Just a cool thing
in the end, who

00:57:18.340 --> 00:57:19.810
can recognize this actor here?

00:57:19.810 --> 00:57:22.000
Show of hands.

00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:23.320
OK, who can recognize him now?

00:57:25.960 --> 00:57:30.270
So facial motion gives away a
lot of things like identity.

00:57:30.270 --> 00:57:34.860
Jack Nicholson has very
typical facial movements.

00:57:34.860 --> 00:57:37.350
So it's not just agency, it's
not just facial expressions,

00:57:37.350 --> 00:57:39.641
it's also identity and lots
of things that can go away.

00:57:39.641 --> 00:57:44.170
So we actually don't know yet
what these areas are doing.

00:57:44.170 --> 00:57:47.830
So my summary, and I'm
sorry I'm going into lunch.

00:57:47.830 --> 00:57:50.436
So we can do fMRI on macaque
monkeys just as in humans.

00:57:50.436 --> 00:57:51.810
What we find we
can apply to lots

00:57:51.810 --> 00:57:53.309
of domains within
attention studies,

00:57:53.309 --> 00:57:54.492
found new attention areas.

00:57:54.492 --> 00:57:55.950
Here we applied to
face processing,

00:57:55.950 --> 00:57:58.530
we find face selected
areas for face processing.

00:57:58.530 --> 00:58:00.400
Recording the micro stimulate--

00:58:00.400 --> 00:58:03.780
so inactivating these regions
is supporting the notion

00:58:03.780 --> 00:58:05.940
that these are
likely modules that

00:58:05.940 --> 00:58:10.590
are selective for processing
faces and faces only.

00:58:10.590 --> 00:58:13.800
These are interconnected into
a face processing network.

00:58:13.800 --> 00:58:16.050
It looks like all these areas
have different functions

00:58:16.050 --> 00:58:16.980
and specializations.

00:58:16.980 --> 00:58:19.320
So fMRI experiments
are notoriously

00:58:19.320 --> 00:58:23.576
under powered in the way of
number of different dimensions.

00:58:23.576 --> 00:58:25.200
So if we call them
face areas it is not

00:58:25.200 --> 00:58:26.880
to say that they're
all doing the same,

00:58:26.880 --> 00:58:28.910
but they likely all have
different functions and likely

00:58:28.910 --> 00:58:30.618
sub regions of these
different functions.

00:58:30.618 --> 00:58:33.240
So again, there's no
contradiction here

00:58:33.240 --> 00:58:35.380
to the view of a
fine organization.

00:58:35.380 --> 00:58:36.964
Then there's a seventh
face area which

00:58:36.964 --> 00:58:38.171
doesn't seem to be connected.

00:58:38.171 --> 00:58:40.640
Could be separate and separate
face processing system.

00:58:40.640 --> 00:58:43.170
We have evidence for processing
that we can understand now

00:58:43.170 --> 00:58:44.950
in computational terms.

00:58:44.950 --> 00:58:46.860
And this is one way
that it can link,

00:58:46.860 --> 00:58:49.830
sometimes causally sometimes
correlationally, activity

00:58:49.830 --> 00:58:50.580
of single cells.

00:58:50.580 --> 00:58:52.410
Two different levels
of organization

00:58:52.410 --> 00:58:54.380
to a very complex
social behavior.

00:58:54.380 --> 00:58:56.670
And that's, again, I think
a very cool opportunity

00:58:56.670 --> 00:58:59.169
to have in the domain
of social cognition

00:58:59.169 --> 00:59:01.710
that you can actually control
stimuli very well because faces

00:59:01.710 --> 00:59:04.200
are so powerful to get
into your social brain,

00:59:04.200 --> 00:59:06.870
you can likely take this
approach deeper and get insight

00:59:06.870 --> 00:59:09.450
into actual social intelligence
beyond face perception

00:59:09.450 --> 00:59:11.190
this way.

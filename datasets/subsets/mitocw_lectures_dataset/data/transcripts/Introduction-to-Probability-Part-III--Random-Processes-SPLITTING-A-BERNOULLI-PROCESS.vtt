00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:02.890
We will now consider
an operation

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:06.380
that is, in some sense,
the opposite of merging.

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:10.960
We have a node, and traffic
arrives to that node.

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:14.820
And each time that we have
an arrival, we flip a coin.

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.000
And with probability
q, we send that arrival

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.410
to one particular stream.

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:22.830
And with probability
1 minus q, we

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.380
send the arrival
to another stream.

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.660
So we get two streams
that are formed

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.970
by taking the original
stream and splitting it

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:32.750
into two pieces.

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.290
And as an example,
these might be

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:38.040
arrivals at a department store.

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.950
And one stream
corresponds to the people

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.220
who go to the clothes section
of the department store,

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:46.680
whereas the other stream
corresponds to the people that

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.840
go to all of the other
sections of the store.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.030
So let us now make our
model a little more precise.

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:56.950
We have a Bernoulli
process, which

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:59.390
is independent across time.

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.590
We also use an
independent coin flip

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.540
to deal with each
one of the arrivals.

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.135
But we will also make one
additional assumption, namely

00:01:10.135 --> 00:01:12.789
that the Bernoulli
process is also

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:17.320
independent from the
process of coin flips.

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.720
With this assumption
in place, let us now

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.880
continue, and let
us draw a picture.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.850
We have a Bernoulli
process with parameter p,

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.360
and arrivals get recorded
at certain times.

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.450
Each time that there is an
arrival, we will flip a coin.

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.810
And with probability
q, the arrival

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.009
will be sent to that stream.

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:41.610
With probability 1
minus q, the arrival

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.700
will be sent to
the other stream.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.110
So one possible outcome
of the experiment

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.140
might be this one, where
these two arrivals were

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.530
sent to this stream and
these two arrivals were

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.450
sent to the top stream.

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.910
And we have these
probabilities q and 1 minus q

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:06.310
of sending the arrivals to
one or the other stream.

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:11.070
What kind of
process is this one?

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:13.900
We argue it is a
Bernoulli process.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.710
First, we need to
check independence.

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:20.700
Here, the argument is more or
less the same as in the case

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.590
when we studied the
merging of processes.

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:29.250
For example, if we look at two
different slots and we ask,

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.880
how is the event at that slot
and at that slot determined?

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.160
Well, what happens in
this slot is determined

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.120
by whether we had
an arrival here

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.760
and what happened to the outcome
of the coin flip at that time.

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.030
What happens in this
slot is determined

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.550
by whether we had
an arrival here

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:53.480
and what happened to the
coin flip at that time.

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.540
Now, the coin flips
are independent

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.640
from the original
Bernoulli process.

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.940
And for either the coin flips
or the Bernoulli process,

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:03.800
we have independence
across time.

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.380
So all of the four random
variables involved here

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.630
that determine what
happens in these two slots

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.170
are independent of each other.

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.560
So what happens in
this slot is a function

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.950
of two random
variables here, which

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.650
are independent from the
two random variables that

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.930
determined what
happens in that slot.

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.070
So what happens in these two
slots are independent events.

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:28.990
And this argument goes
through more generally

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:32.290
when we consider
multiple distinct slots.

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.470
So this is the argument
for the independence

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:39.740
of the different slots in
this particular process.

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:42.500
And then during each
slot, what happens

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.140
is that we will have
an arrival if and only

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.680
if this process records
an arrival, which happens

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.490
with probability p, and
the corresponding coin

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:57.300
flip happens to send the
arrival in this direction, which

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.170
happens with probability q.

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.300
And so the conclusion
is that this process

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:04.310
is a Bernoulli process
with parameter p times q.

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:09.600
By a similar argument, the
other process that we obtain

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:15.250
will also be Bernoulli but with
probability p times 1 minus q.

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:19.040
And a final question--
are these two processes

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:23.530
that we get after the splitting
independent of each other?

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:25.600
This is a question
that we can answer

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.110
by reasoning intuitively.

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:32.920
If I tell you that there
was an arrival in this slot,

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:35.780
what can you infer from this?

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:38.700
Well, it tells me that
there was an arrival

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:42.290
in the original stream,
which was sent here.

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:44.600
But since it was sent
in this direction,

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:47.730
it means that it was not
sent in the other direction.

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:51.960
And so we do not have
an arrival in this slot.

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.060
Knowing that we
have an arrival here

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.720
means that we do not
have an arrival there.

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:59.500
So information about
one of the streams

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:03.280
gives us information about what
happened in the other stream.

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.950
And therefore, we do
not have independence.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.890
So this is what happens when we
split two Bernoulli processes.

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:14.010
And earlier we saw
what happens when

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:17.090
we merge two independent
Bernoulli processes.

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:19.480
These two operations of
merging and splitting

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:23.690
are quite common in
constructing more complex models

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:29.020
using Bernoulli processes as
the elements of those models.

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:32.350
They are often useful models
either in transportation

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:34.800
systems, where you
have streams of traffic

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:39.690
that merge or split, also in
models of computer networks

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:42.510
or any other kind
of queueing system.

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:45.310
And these same operations
of merging and splitting

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:48.740
will also show up when we
study the continuous time

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:52.697
analog of the Bernoulli process,
namely the Poisson process.

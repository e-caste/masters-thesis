00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Julia just mentioned that a few
of you had commented,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
when we were talking about the
genetic code, that some of you

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
thought the fact that it was
degenerate, it had some redundancy

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
in it, like multiple codons or
threonine, that that was kind of

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
cool, and some of you thought it was
sort of a waste and would have maybe

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
designed the thing differently.
That's, you know, part of when you

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
study biology you don't get to
design it from first principles.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
You found out what happened during
evolution and what got selected for.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
And once it gets selected for then
that gets sort of fixed in nature.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
If there were four nucleotides then
you could have one,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
two and three-letter words.
And it's going to be a three-letter

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
word to have at least 20 then you've
got some degeneracy or redundancy,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
but that's not necessarily a bad
thing.  And, in fact,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
if you go into the evolution of the
code more deeply,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
people are beginning to suspect it
evolved from a simpler one.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
And there actually are some
relationships between some of the

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
codons that go back to the
similarities, the chemical

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
similarities between the amino acids.
And it also allows some things for

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
some cells, for example,
if they want proteins to be present

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
at very low levels they will use a
codon that has just a very low level

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
of the corresponding tRNA.
And if they want to make a lot of

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
the protein they'll use a tRNA that
it makes in abundance.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
And so it's sort of another way of
controlling levels of proteins.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
There are a lot of different
subtleties in here.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
And also in biology redundancy is
not necessarily a bad thing.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
It's just like on a space flight,
if something goes wrong and if

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
there's some kind of redundant
function then you've got some

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
backups, too.  OK.
Well, in any case,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
today is a pretty interesting first
part of the lecture.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
I've heard a few people express the
view that why can't I just teach

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
what's in the textbook
and get on with it?

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000
And I think this part,
for those of you who are following,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
really trying to understand what I'm
trying to do with this course,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.000
I hope this will help you to see
this.  Because what I've talked

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000
about, this thing that Crick called
the "central dogma" which was the

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.000
direction of information flow in
biology which was from DNA

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
to RNA to proteins.
And I'll just remind you,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
although proteins do many things
they are, for example,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000
enzymes that are biological
catalysts.  And it was pretty

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
well-established,
even by the time I was an undergrad

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
that this was the way information
flow went in biology and this was

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
how it worked.
And there were various statements

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
in the literature that what was true
for E. coli was true

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
for an elephant.
And it is still true today in a

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
broad sense that,
as I've tried to emphasize

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
throughout the course,
when you get down to a cellular

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
molecule level there's an awful lot
in common and things look much more

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
alike than different compared to
what we see at a more macroscopic

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
scale.  However,
that doesn't mean that all the

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
details are the same.
And maybe you could begin to get a

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
glimmering of that when I told you
that although the genetic code is

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
virtually universal.
That almost every organism,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
with only a couple very tiny
exceptions, uses exactly the same

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000
genetic code to have nucleotides
correspond to three-letter words in

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000
the nucleic acid alphabet correspond
to particular amino acids in a

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000
protein.  But the other languages
that are written in there such as

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000
the sequence to start transcribing a
gene, making an RNA copy are stopped.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.000
Those are different between
different organisms.  Yeah?

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Glycolysis enzymes are amazingly

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000
similar.  They are very clearly,
they arose once, and they have

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
stayed right through evolution.
You could, in principle, sometimes

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
in evolution you get something that
creates a function and something

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
that starts out,
and then like what they call

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000
convergent evolution you end up with
two things that came from a

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
different evolutionary origin but
have learned to do,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000
let's say, catalyze the same
biochemical reaction or something.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000
Glycolysis came once.
But if you were to look inside E.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000
coli or yeast, let's say E. coli and
look at how those enzymes are

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.000
regulated, the thing that says this
is the start of a gene,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000
start making the RNA, it would look
totally different than if you looked

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.000
in a mouse because the language,
the promoter does not have the same

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000
sequence in an E.
coli and in a human or in a mouse.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.000
And I'll tell you more about that
today.  But there were --

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000
I want to just now tell you sort of
three things that were sort of

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000
exceptions to this general way of
thinking.  Every one of them

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000
generated a Nobel Prize.
And this is a fun lecture for me to

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000
give because the individuals
involved in all of these things had

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000
a very, very close association with
MIT.  And when I told you when Crick

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000
called this a central dogma he meant
a hypothesis, or at least an idea

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.000
for which there was not
reasonable evidence.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.000
And he learned later it was
something a true believer cannot

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.000
doubt.  And once this gets
established it does get in the

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000
textbook and it does get in your
thinking.  And so information goes

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000
down this way.
But there were a few oddities.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000
I mean there were some viruses that
had RNA inside them.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000
They didn't have DNA.
So how where these handled?

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:06.000
Well, there turned out to be two
classes of RNA virus.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:12.000
One that was studied quite heavily
called, it's a plant virus called

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:18.000
the tobacco mosaic virus.
And it had a coat.  And then it had

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:24.000
in it a piece of RNA.
Now, you can see if that virus were

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:31.000
to inject RNA in the cell it could
encode proteins.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:39.000
But that genetic material has to be
copied.  And the RNA was copied --

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:55.000
-- by an RNA dependent

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:04.000
RNA polymerase.
And so it's sort of just like the

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.000
RNA polymerase before,
except instead of using DNA as its

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.000
template it can use RNA.
So that sort of somehow would be a

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.000
little loop in here about RNA being
able to copy itself that hadn't been

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:24.000
anticipated.  And although this is
an important virus in the plant

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:29.000
industry, for plants and agriculture,
it's not so important for humans.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:37.000
But there's another class of RNA
viruses that are very important.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:46.000
And these are called retroviruses.
And the reason these are so

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:55.000
important is that the HIV-1 virus
that's associated with AIDS is such

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:04.000
a retrovirus.  It's a virus that has
a coat and it has an RNA that's it

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:11.000
genetic material.
And the person who worked out how

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000
this goes was a person at MIT,
Dave Baltimore.  He was a colleague

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000
of mine here for many years.
He was the person who founded the

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.000
White Head Institute and got that up
and going.  And he then finally,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.000
to move up one more administrative
challenge, went to Caltech

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:32.000
to be president.
And that's where he is today.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000
And David was working on this
problem trying to figure out how

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:41.000
these retroviruses work.
And they're important.  Not only

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.000
the HIV-1 virus,
but there are certain viruses that

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:50.000
are associated with cancer.
In general, what they do is they've

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000
picked up what's called an oncogene
which is sort of often a mutated

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:59.000
version of one of your
normal genes.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.000
And if that virus gets inside one of
your cells and brings in this

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.000
mutated gene it's sort of kind of
the same consequence as mutating one

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:12.000
of your own genes along that
progression of cancer.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000
So it can kind of, say,
bring in a cell that screws up the

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:21.000
control on when cells are supposed
to replicate and stop dividing and

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.000
so on.  So David started to work on
these, and what he discovered was

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000
that these viruses encoded,
they had information encoding

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:35.000
proteins.
And one of the proteins encoded in

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:42.000
their RNA is an enzyme
de-characterized which is given the

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:48.000
name "reverse transcriptase".
And what this can do is take an RNA

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:55.000
template and make the corresponding
complimentary DNA strand in this way.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:02.000
So that if we took the --
We'll just take this RNA out of the

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:08.000
virus.  What this virus encodes then
is an enzyme that's able to take

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:14.000
this RNA and make the corresponding
DNA copy.  So there's the original

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:21.000
RNA that was in the virus.
There is the RNA that it started

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:27.000
out.  And so what is happening,
if you will in that case, is the

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:34.000
information is flowing in
the other direction.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:44.000
That was a marvelous discovery.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000
And it was discovered by someone
who wasn't willing just to take what

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000
was in the textbooks but was trying
to figure out what could possibly be

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000
going on here.
Now, the way these viruses work

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000
then, once they've done this it's
not so bad because they've got their

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:06.000
information now in the form of DNA.
So this strand of DNA can be made

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:13.000
into a double-stranded DNA by just
using the kinds of enzymes that

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:19.000
we've already talked about.
A DNA dependent DNA polymerase will

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:26.000
be able to copy the other thing.
And now you've got a DNA copy of

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:33.000
the information that used to be in
the virus.  But what happens to that

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:40.000
is that you have a piece
of the host DNA.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:48.000
And this viral DNA then inserts into
it, so you end up with this

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:56.000
situation where you have DNA from
the host, and this

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:04.000
is the virus DNA.
So this is the DNA that encodes the

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:10.000
information needed for the virus.
And if this was our DNA then it

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:17.000
would be inserted that way.
And there are just a handful of

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:23.000
health messages I've tried to drive
home in this thing.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:30.000
I mentioned smoking the other day.
If you smoke --

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000
If you stop smoking you basically,
well, let me try another way.  The

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.000
risk of smoking is about equal to
the sum of everything else you can

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000
possibly do in your life that will
affect your chances of getting

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:47.000
cancer, leaving aside what you
inherited from mom and dad.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:51.000
The one single thing to not do if
you want to avoid cancer,

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.000
or to help loved ones who smoke
avoid cancer, is just don't smoke,

00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:00.000
or if you do smoke, stop.
You freeze the risk of whatever

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:06.000
increased risk you've got,
and then just live with that,

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:11.000
but it doesn't keep getting worse
with time.  The other one is

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:17.000
practice safe sex,
and this is why.  HIV-1 is a

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:22.000
retrovirus.  If you get infected
with it, it makes a DNA copy of the

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:28.000
RNA, it makes the other strand of
the DNA, and it sticks itself in.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:34.000
So what you've got is your DNA here,
your DNA there.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:39.000
And HIV-1 is a permanent traveling
companion for the rest of your life.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:44.000
There's no way of getting that out
of there right now.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:49.000
All the systems for dealing with
AIDS are just managing the infection.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:54.000
So when someone is HIV-1 positive,
they've got those viral genes now

00:13:54.000 --> 00:14:00.000
permanently integrated
into their DNA.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.000
So it's extremely important that you
be aware of that,

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.000
or if you know people who don't
appreciate this because they haven't

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.000
got so much of a biology background
that you help them understand that.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000
OK.  So I just wanted to show you,
I found one other picture last night.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000
And this is you see all these old
scientists, right?

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.000
Of course, David didn't look like
this when he was doing his work.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.000
In fact, I think he's fairly
cleaned up here.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.000
I found this one in the Cold Spring
Harbor archives last night.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
I've seen pictures of him looking
considerably more shaggy and perhaps

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000
disreputable and stuff.
But anyway, when David was making

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:42.000
all these discoveries he was still
quite a young man.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
I believe he got his Nobel Prize
when he was still in his thirties.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.000
And so many of these discoveries
are made by people that are not all

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
that much older than you.
But, again, it's trying to

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000
understand why we know what we know
and then trying to fit

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:01.000
other things into it.
Now, the next thing I want to tell

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:09.000
you about that has some of this same
character, I've sort of told you

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:16.000
that you have a piece of DNA.
Let's say there's a gene here and

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:24.000
this is the coding region,
and then we make a mRNA copy,

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:32.000
and then we use the genetic code and
we make the protein.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:37.000
And so if we sequence the DNA and
find the beginning of this protein

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:42.000
we can read along using that genetic
code and away it should go.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:47.000
And that was beautifully worked out,
understood, just like I sort of

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:52.000
finished up telling you the other
day.  So Phil Sharp who got a Nobel

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:57.000
Prize for this work and his
colleague in the Biology

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:02.000
Department.
He's in the Cancer Center just

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.000
across the street from the building
I'm in.  That was the cancer center

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:11.000
that Salvador Laurier,
who Jim Watson trained with,

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:16.000
had founded.  And Phil was studying
this process.  It was before we

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.000
could sequence DNA.
It was in the mid '70s.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:25.000
And he was working with the tools
we had then trying to map the

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:30.000
relationship of an RNA to a gene
that was on a virus.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:35.000
It was a DNA virus,
not an RNA virus, so don't get

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:40.000
yourself mixed up with that.
But what he had was basically a

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:46.000
fragment of DNA that he knew encoded
the gene.  So he knew somewhere on

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:51.000
this piece of DNA there was a gene
somewhere in here,

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:57.000
and he had isolated the mRNA.
And one way you could map,

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:02.000
physically see the relationship of
an RNA and a DNA would be to take,

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:08.000
let's just take away one of these
strands.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:13.000
So we have the complimentary strand
of the DNA to the RNA.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:19.000
And if we mix them together and let
them slowly cool down they will form

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:24.000
hydrogen bonds.
They'll form a DNA-RNA hybrid just

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:30.000
the same way two strands of DNA come
on.  And so if the gene was a little

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:36.000
shorter than the piece of DNA then
you might have expected to see

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:41.000
something that looked like this.
And the way you'd see this,

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:45.000
if you looked in an electron
microscope --

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:52.000
-- perhaps it would look sort of

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:56.000
like this.  You cannot actually see
the two strands,

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:00.000
but you'd see a thick part.
That would be the RNA duplex.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:06.000
So this would be just DNA.
And the thick part is RNA base

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:12.000
paired with a single strand of DNA.
You got it?  That's what textbooks

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:18.000
said you should have seen.
And so this is more.  This is data

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:24.000
from Phil's paper describing this.
And let me focus on this one in

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:31.000
particular.  That's what
he actually saw.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:38.000
You guys got any idea what's going

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:43.000
on?  Why don't you take a minute,
find somebody who's near you and see

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:48.000
if you can come up with any ideas.
Here's the hybrid.  Forget about

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:54.000
this little bit at the 3 prime end.
That's not a worry.  Here is the

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:59.000
thing.  And this,
I think, is a piece of single

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:05.000
stranded DNA sticking out the end.
But it looks a bit more complicated.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:11.000
Any ideas?  Most people put this
data in their drawers.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:17.000
Phil didn't.  Phil and his
colleagues didn't.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:23.000
What they realized was,
I'm going to try and redraw this

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:30.000
just very slightly to help you see
what's going on.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:35.000
What they were seeing was something
that looked rather like what they

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:40.000
were expecting.
They were seeing a region of hybrid

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:45.000
DNA and they were seeing a region of
single-stranded DNA like this,

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:50.000
but what it looked like was there
were little loops of single-stranded

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:55.000
DNA sticking out.
And what Phil had discovered was a

00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:01.000
phenomenon we now know
as RNA splicing.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:08.000
And here's what goes on.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:12.000
In bacteria, with very few
exceptions, you can look at the DNA,

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:16.000
you can find the open reading frame
and you can just read off the

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.000
sequence of the protein.
You find the ATG, AUG, methionine

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.000
codon, and then it keeps going no
stops, and finally you come to a

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:28.000
stop codon and you see there is the
protein.  So the coding information

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:33.000
is essentially continuous in almost
all bacterial genes.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:37.000
And there's a few,
some genes like that in eukaryotes,

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:41.000
but many eukaryotic genes are
constructed, it's almost as if you

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:45.000
took the gene you'd find in a
bacterium and then you'd cut it in a

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:50.000
bunch of places and stuck extra DNA
in between all of the pieces.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:54.000
So you'd get something like this
where there's,

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:59.000
in the DNA there'd be coding
information.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:07.000
And then non-coding information and
another block of coding information.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:16.000
And then a block of non-coding and
say another one of coding

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:24.000
information.  So this is a
double-stranded DNA.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:33.000
And what happens then when the cell
makes RNA is the whole thing gets

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:42.000
copied into what's known now as a
pre-messenger RNA.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:47.000
And so there's a bit of coding stuff
here, there's a bit of coding stuff

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:52.000
here, and there's some more coding
stuff there.  But what the cell has

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:57.000
is sort of like your unedited
footage from your family summer

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:03.000
vacating when you were running
the video camera.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:07.000
And maybe you don't want to show
everybody ever second of video that

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:11.000
you took during the thing.
So what you do, you get in there

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:16.000
and you edit it.
In the old days you used to have to

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.000
take the film and splice it.
And now you can all do it with

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:25.000
iMovie or something like that.
But what you do is take the pieces

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:29.000
of information you want,
and this is what the cell is doing.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:36.000
It takes this part of the RNA.
And this part of the RNA,

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:45.000
and joins it together, and then this
part.  And when it's done it has the

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:54.000
mRNA that now looks like the kind of
mRNA that you would find in a

00:22:54.000 --> 00:23:03.000
bacterium where you can
find the start codon.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:09.000
And then you could read in
three-letter words all the way

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:15.000
through to the end of the protein.
So, in essence, what Phil found was

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:21.000
that in many organisms at least
there's another step in here where

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:27.000
we get RNA splicing.
And only after that you get down to

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:33.000
proteins.
What was quite remarkable about this

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:37.000
result and why I'm kind of hammering
on it a little bit is this is the

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:41.000
data that's out of Phil's paper.
You can look it up on the Internet.

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:45.000
Type in Phil Sharp 1977 and you'll
find this original paper with that

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:49.000
figure in it.  The moment Phil
realized what he was and talked

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:53.000
about it at a meeting,
a whole lot of people suddenly sort

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:57.000
of almost simultaneously discovered
RNA splicing because they opened

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:01.000
their drawers and there were all
these uninterpretable electron

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:06.000
micrographs they had.
And they were in very short order

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:10.000
able to save it in the system.
The same thing was going on, but it

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:14.000
was just confusing,
it didn't fit, and to some extent

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:18.000
most people's minds were set by this
paradigm, this central dogma as

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:22.000
something that a true believer
cannot doubt.  And you had to have a

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:27.000
flexible enough mind to
be able to see that.

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:33.000
And so this is an important piece of
biology that hadn't been anticipated.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:39.000
And it can be quite remarkable.
I'm just going to give you a couple

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:45.000
of extreme examples.
Well, not even extreme examples.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:51.000
But just show you how much
non-coding information there can be.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:57.000
Factor 8 is a protein that plays a
part in blood clotting.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:03.000
And the gene is 200 kilobase pairs.
And the pre-mRNA is just a direct

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:11.000
copy, so it's 200 kilobases.
It's just a single strand so it's

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:19.000
not a base pair.
And the actually spliced mRNA when

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:27.000
it's done is 10 kilobases.
So that means that only 5% of the

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:35.000
gene is coding information and 95%
of that information gets thrown away

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:42.000
when the RNA gets spliced.
And even a more extreme example is a

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:48.000
protein called dystrophin.
This is what's affected in a human

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:55.000
genetic disease known as Duchenne
muscular dystrophy.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:06.000
In this case, the gene is two mega

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:17.000
base pairs.  So of course then the
pre-mRNA is also two mega bases but

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:28.000
the pre-RNA is 16 kilobases.
So in this case less than 1% of the

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:40.000
gene has coding information
for making a protein.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:44.000
There are a lot of interesting
reasons as to why it would be like

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:49.000
this.  One this,
things can evolve more rapidly

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:54.000
sometimes because you have parts of
proteins that are sort of like

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:59.000
modules and evolution can
probably connect them.

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:03.000
I fact, it also provides ways of
regulating because we now know there

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:08.000
are alternative ways of splicing RNA.
So you can take one RNA and then

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:12.000
splice it in different ways in
different cells and end up

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:17.000
generating different proteins that
were all encoded by one particular

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:21.000
gene.  And so it gives cells
different kinds of regulatory

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:26.000
strategies they can use.
Now, the third sort of thing that

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:31.000
came out that falls in this same
kind of thing of people having their

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:36.000
minds open and not fixed by the
current understanding or bounded by

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:41.000
the current understanding is the
discovery that RNA can act as an

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:46.000
enzyme.  And I've already talked to
you about that and I've told it was

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:51.000
ribozyme, but it was discovered by
Tom Cech.  Tom is currently

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:56.000
president of the Howard Hughes
Medical Institute,

00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:02.000
but he did his post-doctoral work at
MIT with Mary Lou Pardue.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:05.000
I've been a post-doc at Berkeley
when he was just finishing his

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:09.000
graduate work,
and I met him out there.

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:13.000
And then he came to MIT to do his
post-doc.  And a year later I got a

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:17.000
job so I'd become friends there and
became friends when we started here.

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:21.000
So I had a pretty close link to
this particular story.

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:25.000
Here's a picture of Tom together
with Phil.  That's actually my wife

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:29.000
right there who was in this picture.
But Tom actually looks much more

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:35.000
like that.
He's very colorful,

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:43.000
very fun, a very interesting person.
But anyway, when Tom left MIT to

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:51.000
take a faculty position at Bolder he
was interested in trying to

00:28:51.000 --> 00:29:00.000
understand the biochemistry of RNA
splicing.  And so he went --

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:03.000
He did what a good scientist will do.
They'll try and find an

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:07.000
experimental system where the
question they want to address is

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:10.000
simple enough you can actually get
an answer.  There's a kind of way of

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:14.000
doing science where you pick a
system that's too complicated and

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:17.000
you never actually get an answer.
It sounds very important because

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:21.000
you're working on something that's
important but you cannot,

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:24.000
you don't have the tools you need to
get to the answer.

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:28.000
So Tom wanted to work on the
biochemistry of RNA splicing because

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:32.000
that had just been discovered.
And so he went to a small little

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:37.000
tiny organism called tetrahymena.
And the reason he looked at that

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:41.000
was because it had a ribosomal RNA,
so it was an RNA that was made in

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:46.000
great abundance within the organism.
And it only had one of these

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:51.000
non-coding regions.
I'll tell you the words for these

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:56.000
coding and non-coding.
To me they're non-intuitive,

00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:01.000
but I guess you should know them.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:10.000
The coding region is called,
the part that codes is called an

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:19.000
exon and the non-coding part is
called an intron.

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:29.000
So, anyway, Tom worked on this
organism because the pre-mRNA

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:37.000
was basically this.
Or the pre-RNA before the splicing
And whenever I got out to Bolder
we'd try and get in a squash game.

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:45.000
looked like this.
This was going to give this like

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:52.000
that.  He could get large quantities
of this RNA, so he was all set to

00:30:52.000 --> 00:31:00.000
make extracts of the cells of this
organism and then start cooking up
here.  And he went off to,
I guess it was Denmark to learn how

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:08.000
this RNA substrate with all sorts of
cell extracts.
And so I first heard about this,
Tom was working on this when he was

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:00.000
And then his plan was to purify the
enzymes that did the RNA splicing.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:36.000
to grow this organism.
Then they were back and he was off

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:29.000
at Bolder.  And we used to play
squash all the time.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:51.000
So I was out there at a meeting and
we were sitting around in the locker

00:30:51.000 --> 00:31:03.000
room.  And I said so how's the
splicing biochemistry projecting

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:14.000
going?  Tom says,
well, it's going OK,

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:25.000
I guess.  There's only one little
problem, he says.

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:37.000
The controls are splicing.
Now, what he meant was if you were

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:48.000
trying to add cell extract and get
this thing to go what you would

00:31:48.000 --> 00:32:00.000
start out with is the RNA
in a tube basically.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:04.000
And that would be your control.
And then you'd start adding stuff

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:08.000
to it and start looking for splicing.
And what Tom was finding was that

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:12.000
if you just took this RNA and let it
sit in a test tube that the splicing

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:17.000
happened without him putting
anything in.  And here he was

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:21.000
already to find all the enzymes,
the proteins that did it.  And Tom

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:25.000
did an absolutely gorgeous piece of
science to prove that what was

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:30.000
happening was the RNA was catalyzing
its own splicing.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.000
And he had to work very,
very hard to prove that it wasn't a

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:37.000
contaminating protein.
Remember we had this sort of

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:41.000
discussion?  We were talking about
is DNA the genetic material and how

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:45.000
would we know that it wasn't just a
little tiny bit of something else in

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:49.000
our DNA perhaps that was doing it.
Tom had to go through pretty much a

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:53.000
similar exercise,
but this was one of these key

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:57.000
insights that lead to the proof that
RNA could function as a catalyst,

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:02.000
what we now know as a ribozyme.
And I've shown you now we now sort

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:08.000
of accept that the actual ribosome
itself is a ribozyme and that the

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:15.000
formation of the peptide bond,
the thing that's the heart of all

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:22.000
proteins is made by a ribozyme,
not catalyzed by ribosomes and not

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:28.000
by a protein.  OK.
So the next topic that I want to

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:35.000
try on which sort of we've already
set up from this is that if the

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:42.000
information is all in DNA to begin
with then if you make an RNA copy

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:49.000
you're only taking a segment of that
information at a time.

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:55.000
And that gives the cells a lot of
possibilities for regulating how

00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:01.000
they respond to the environment or
just controlling what genes are

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:07.000
expressed.  And there are basically
two kinds of strategies that are

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:14.000
involved in these regulatory
decisions.  They can either be --

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:29.000
Can either be reversible changes.

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:33.000
For example, a bacterium and a food
source.  If you're a bacterium and

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:38.000
you've got enzymes that let you eat
a hundred different kinds of food

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:42.000
and you're in an environment where
there's only one of them there,

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:47.000
you're really wasting energy if you
make the proteins to make the other

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:52.000
99.  So you might guess that somehow
evolution has selected four systems

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:56.000
that have learned how to turn on and
off the things they need to eat

00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:01.000
certain food sources depending on
whether the food source

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:06.000
is available.
We only carry umbrellas when it

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:10.000
rains.  If you had to carry an
umbrella and a snowsuit and a

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:14.000
surfboard, everything all the time,
it would slow you down in evolution.

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:18.000
So the other type, which we've
talked about as well when we talked

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:22.000
about starting as a single cell and
going up to the 14 cells that make

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:26.000
us up, then many of those changes,
as those cells go along and

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:31.000
progressively more specialized need
to be irreversible.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:36.000
And this is particularly important

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:40.000
in development.
We don't want a cell in our retina

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:44.000
suddenly deciding it should be part
of a heart and start to make a heart

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:48.000
in the middle of your eye or
something like that.

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:52.000
So things in development tend to be
once you're off you're off or once

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:56.000
you're on you're on or something.
And just to give you another little

00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:00.000
look at that picture I've shown you
before of the nematode.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:03.000
And at the time,
the first time I showed you this,

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:07.000
I was just trying to emphasize that
we could take the gene encoding

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:11.000
green fluorescent protein and put it
in anything and it would go green.

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:15.000
In this case, Barbara Meyer who is
at Berkeley now but used to be my

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:19.000
office-mate at MIT for many years,
what she's done is she's taken that

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:23.000
green fluorescent protein,
the gene for that, and she's put it

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:27.000
under the control of a regulatory
system, a gene that is made to be

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:31.000
expressed in the esophagus
of the worm.

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:35.000
And so even though that gene is
present in all the cells of that

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:39.000
organism, it's under the control of
a system that usually permits the

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:44.000
genes to be made that are needed for
making esophagus but not in other

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:48.000
parts of the body.
So you probably didn't pick that

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:53.000
part up now but sort of take another
look at that same thing and see

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:57.000
something different.
So how do we learn about gene

00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:03.000
regulation?
The key work, like so many of these

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:09.000
things, started kind of
inauspiciously,

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:16.000
if you will.  There were two French
scientists, Jacques Monod,

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:23.000
who is a biochemist, Francois Jacob
who was a geneticist.

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:30.000
And they were working on the
metabolism of lactose by E. coli.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:36.000
Lactose is galactose,
beta 1,4 glucose.  And you don't

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:42.000
have to know exactly the structure.
You can just remember there were a

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:49.000
lot of different hydroxyls,
and that was one particular linkage.

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:55.000
And there's an enzyme that cleaves
this into galactose and glucose.

00:37:55.000 --> 00:38:01.000
And this can go right into
glycolysis and make energy

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:07.000
for the organism.
And the galactose undergoes a couple

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:12.000
of different transformations,
and it can get in there as well.

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:17.000
But in order to get at the energy
that's in those carbohydrates,

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:22.000
this linkage has to be broken.  And
it was broken by an enzyme called

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:27.000
beta-galactosidase.
That's a protein that's able to

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:32.000
catalyze the cleavage
of those two sugars.

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:39.000
That's what Jacques Monod and
Francois Jacob were studying.

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:46.000
They were helped out in this
exercise.  I guess part of the

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:53.000
reason they got going on this was
people had noticed for many years

00:38:53.000 --> 00:39:00.000
that if you grew E.
coli in glucose there was no

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:08.000
beta-gal.
I'm going to abbreviate this as

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:16.000
beta-gal just so I won't have to
keep writing the same thing.

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:25.000
But if they grew E. coli in lactose
beta-gal was present.

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:34.000
And they had to be able to assay
for this enzyme.  And they used --

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:43.000
There were standard types of

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:47.000
biochemical assays you could use.
But some chemists that helped

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:52.000
design a very cleaver kind of
substrate that helped them,

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:57.000
that could be used in these kinds of
studies, and I'll show you one of

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:01.000
them.  What this enzyme really looks
at is it looks at, let's

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:06.000
see, galactose.
What it sees is sort of the

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:10.000
galactose side of this linkage,
and then it reaches in and catalyzes

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:14.000
the cleavage of what's joined to it.
And it turns out not to be specific

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:18.000
for whether glucose is on the other
side.  It can accept substrates that

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:22.000
have other things as well.
So some chemists made some variants

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:26.000
like this.  This is a compound
that's commonly known as X-gal.

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:31.000
If you talk to it in the lab it's
got a longer chemical name.

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:36.000
But what happens if
beta-galactosidase is there,

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:41.000
it's able to cleave this substrate
so you get galactose,

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:46.000
which is colorless.  But if you get
just X, this is colored,

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:51.000
but up here this original material
is also colorless.

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:56.000
So this is very convenient because
if you use a substrate such as this

00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:02.000
you could put the cells on a plate
with this indicator.

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:05.000
And if they are colored,
and the color is blue, you'd know

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:09.000
they were making beta-galactosidase.
And if you don't see a color, you

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:13.000
know they're not.
There are a variety of ways of

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:17.000
assaying for this enzyme.
With that I'm just trying to give

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:21.000
you a little bit of flavor of one of
the different ways that they could

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:25.000
assay for it.  Now,
one of the issues was it looked as

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:29.000
though E. coli didn't have any
beta-galactosidase activity if

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:33.000
lactose was absent when
growing a glucose.

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:36.000
And they made it if lactose was
present.  Well,

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:40.000
that would be kind of what you would
expect evolution would have figured

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:44.000
out how to do,
only make the enzyme for

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:48.000
metabolizing lactose if the lactose
is present, but they had to figure

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:52.000
out what the molecular basis of this
was.  And one of the possibilities

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:56.000
was that the protein was made that
it was all sort of unfolded,

00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:00.000
and when the substrate came in then
it folded all around it and then it

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:03.000
could cleave it.
Or another possibility,

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:07.000
which would be the kind we're
talking about now,

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:11.000
is the protein is not made until the
lactose is present,

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:14.000
and then it makes it new.
So they had to figure out,

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:18.000
between these two, which of these
two was true.  When you see the

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:22.000
lactose present,
is it just beta-galactosidase is

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:26.000
already made but it's inactive,
or is it being made de novo when you

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:32.000
add the lactose?
So what they did was they grew cells

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:40.000
in glucose plus radioactive
C14-leucine for a long time.

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:53.000
So all the proteins --

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:56.000
-- were radioactive.
And once they got, that's going for

00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:00.000
a long time.  So every protein being
made is radioactive.

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:07.000
Then they add excess unlabeled
leucine.  So this means that from

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:14.000
now on any new proteins that are
made will not be radioactive because

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:21.000
you're just going to swamp out any
radioactive stuff with this.

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:29.000
And they added glucose, excuse me,
now they added lactose through the

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:35.000
cells.
And then they isolated the beta-gal

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:40.000
enzyme.  It was actually pretty easy
to do.  It's a huge enzyme and it's

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:45.000
a tetramer.  So very large.
Even in those days it was fairly

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:50.000
easy to isolate this enzyme.
And then they looked to see is it

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:55.000
radioactive?  If it's radioactive it
was there all along and it's

00:43:55.000 --> 00:44:00.000
refolded to become the
active enzyme.

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:05.000
Or if it had been only after lactose
then it would be made de novo in

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:10.000
response to it.
And what they found was that it was

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:19.000
non-radioactive.

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:32.000
Which implied that it was made after
you added the lactose.

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:38.000
So they knew then that they were
studying a system in which a protein

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:44.000
was only made after the cells had
experienced a particular growth

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:50.000
substrate.  And so a lot of work
went into figuring out how this

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:56.000
system worked.
Let's see.  We're a little short on

00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:01.000
time.
So I'll tell you what I'll do.

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:06.000
I'll tell you, I'll just put out
quickly the mechanics of what they

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:10.000
saw, and we'll start in on the
regulation on how this works.

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:15.000
And some of you may be able to
figure it out.

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:20.000
What we now know is that the gene
that encodes beta-galactosidase is

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:25.000
in a stretch of DNA that's pretty
interesting.  It's got three genes.

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:30.000
It's the gene lacZ.  This is the
gene for beta-galactosidase.

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:37.000
And another gene called lacY and
lacZ.  There's a promoter.

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:45.000
That's a start signal for
transcription.

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:52.000
Remember that?
So there's a sequence here that

00:45:52.000 --> 00:46:00.000
says start transcription.
Down here is a terminator.

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:06.000
Another word written in the nucleic
acid alphabet that means stop making

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:12.000
mRNA.  And there is one long mRNA,
as you can see, that has the

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:19.000
peculiarity of encoding three
different genes.

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:25.000
So if you have more than one gene
in a single message then that's

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:40.000
called an operon.

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:46.000
You've got one mRNA.
But, in any case, so whenever

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:52.000
beta-galactosidase was being made
then RNA has to start being made

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:58.000
here, goes to there.
And we won't worry about the

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:03.000
functions of these other two genes.
But, as you might guess from the way

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:08.000
evolution has selected for it,
they have related activities to what

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:12.000
beta-galactosidase does.
And for bacteria it's a very

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:17.000
efficient way to control the
expression of a bunch of genes at

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:22.000
once.  Then there was another gene
up here known as lacI that had a

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:27.000
promoter and a terminator,
and it made an mRNA as well.

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:34.000
And that mRNA encoded a protein
that's known as the lac repressor.

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:42.000
And what that lac repressor does,
it's a protein that has the ability

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:49.000
to recognize a very,
very specific DNA sequence and bind

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:57.000
there.  And I'm just going to kind
of blow up this part of the thing.

00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:04.000
So what we have here is the,
this is the promoter here.  And it

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:11.000
happens that the binding
sequence --

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:22.000
-- for lac repressor overlaps with

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:32.000
the promoter.  Weird,
right?  Maybe not.

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:36.000
So I'll tell you,
well, you can think about this over

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:41.000
the weekend, if you haven't run into
this system before.

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:45.000
So this gene gets made all the time.
So this protein gets made all the

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:50.000
time.  What does that protein do if
it's just like this?

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:55.000
Its job in life is to look for this
sequence and bind to it.

00:48:55.000 --> 00:49:00.000
If it binds to it, it covers up the
promoter.

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:04.000
And the beta-galactosidase gene is
not expressed because the cell

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:09.000
cannot make mRNA.
So this may seem a little obscure,

00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:14.000
but there's something very important
here.  Now the conditionality on

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:19.000
whether this gene is expressed or
not is controlled by a protein,

00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:23.000
right?  It's controlled by this lac
repressor.  If it's on there the

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:28.000
gene will be made.
And if it's off the gene now you

00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:33.000
can make it.
There's a promoter and the RNA

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:38.000
polymerase will see it.
And so you've learned something

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:44.000
about proteins.
They can bind various things.

00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:49.000
And so what lac repressor has,
it's got a little binding site that

00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:54.000
lactose is able to bind to and
change the confirmation of the lac

00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:59.000
repressor.  So why don't you take
those pieces of information and see

00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:05.000
if you can figure out how
the circuitry goes.

00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:11.000
Yeah?  Did I do something wrong?
Sorry.  Oh, sorry.  Excuse me.  Yes,

00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:17.000
Z-Y-A.  Excuse me.
OK?  We'll walk through that on

00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:23.000
Monday, but focus on the fact that
if the repressor is there and

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:30.000
lactose isn't, it binds
to this sequence.

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:34.000
The repressor is made all the time,
but this repressor is something that

00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:39.000
can tell you whether lactose is
there or not.  So you can put the

00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:42.000
circuit together, OK?

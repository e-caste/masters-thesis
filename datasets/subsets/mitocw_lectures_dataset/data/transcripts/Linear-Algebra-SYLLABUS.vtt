GILBERT STRANG: Hi, I'm
Gilbert Strang, and professor

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:11.200
of mathematics at MIT.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:16.309
And I get a chance
to say a few words

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:18.970
about 18.06, Linear Algebra.

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:21.100
It's one of the
basic math courses.

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:26.780
Can I say a little about
linear algebra itself?

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.650
Classes in linear algebra
earlier years tended

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:40.130
to be pretty much for pure math
majors, and a lot of proofs,

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:46.390
and usefulness of the subject
kind of wasn't so clear.

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.110
Whereas, it's an
incredibly useful subject.

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:52.010
Data is coming in all the time.

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.360
We're in the century
of data, and data

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:01.930
tends to come in a matrix, in
a rectangular array of numbers.

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:07.370
And how to understand that
data is a giant, giant problem.

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:12.460
And people use matrices in
solving differential equations

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.760
in economics, everywhere.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.330
So the subject had to
change to bring out

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:24.910
this important aspect, that
it's terrifically useful.

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:27.560
Often networks
are a great model,

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.550
where you have like--
like the internet.

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:36.600
Every website would be
like a node in the network.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.570
And if one website is
linked to another one,

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.530
there would maybe be an
edge in that network.

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.190
So that's a network
with a billion nodes.

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:54.720
And a matrix describes
all those links.

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:00.710
Like when Google produces a
PageRank, you enter-- well,

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.070
you could enter linear
algebra, and see what happens.

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:05.150
I don't know.

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.450
I hope something good.

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.139
Well, anyway, thousands
and millions of stuff

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:14.230
would come up ranked in
order, and that order

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.050
comes from operating--
Google's very fast at it,

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:23.350
very good at it-- operating
on that giant matrix that

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.520
describes the internet.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.820
OK, so a word about the course
itself-- the MIT course.

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.160
First of all, there
will be students coming

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.090
from all the departments.

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:38.970
That includes management.

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.400
Business data comes
in matrix form

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.390
just the way
engineering data comes.

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.930
So there is hardly a
prerequisite for the course.

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.552
There's no big reason why
calculus has to come first.

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.980
Probably most MIT students will
know before the course starts--

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.760
they will have multiplied
a matrix by a vector,

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.820
or multiplied two matrices.

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:13.020
So they've at least
seen matrices before.

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:17.310
But anybody could catch
up on that quickly.

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.080
And then, the course
just takes off.

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.960
Actually, we go back to ask, how
do you understand multiplying

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:26.540
a matrix by a vector?

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.340
A key-- yeah, you guys will
probably know how to do it,

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.970
but let me say it another
way-- A matrix times a vector

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:39.930
produces a combination of
the columns in that matrix,

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.040
those column vectors
in the matrix.

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.970
So that's like the key
step in linear algebra.

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:51.460
What you can do with vectors
is take linear combinations.

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:56.040
Well, at MIT, the course is
organized with three lectures

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.670
a week.

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:02.540
And I use the chalkboard.

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:06.756
I hope you feel, in watching
them, that that's OK.

00:04:06.756 --> 00:04:08.130
The nice thing
about a chalkboard

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:14.150
is you get to see-- what's
written doesn't disappear.

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:17.630
So your eye can
continually check back

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:24.970
and see how does it connect with
what's happening at the moment.

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:28.630
And then, there is one
hour a week of recitation.

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:31.430
Because that's a
smaller class, it just

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:34.050
means there's a
teaching assistant

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:39.710
there, who can help with
problems, suggest new problems.

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:45.020
It can be a problem-based
hour, where my lectures are

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:47.550
more explanation hours.

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:49.770
So about the textbook.

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:53.180
The homeworks come
from the book mostly.

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:56.590
Sometimes we add
MATLAB problems, sort

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:58.940
of specially constructed ones.

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:02.720
But the central
ideas of the subject

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:05.870
are described in each
section of the book,

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:10.880
and then, naturally, exercises
to practice with those ideas.

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:13.720
And then, the neat thing
about 18.06 Scholar

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:20.220
is you get short lectures, short
videos, from six different TAs,

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:23.420
did about six
problem-solving videos each.

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:24.693
And they are neat.

00:05:24.693 --> 00:05:27.530
The TAs are good.

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:31.780
And that's something that
can happen in the recitation

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:33.101
with a smaller group.

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:39.370
There's chance for a discussion,
whereas in the lecture-- well,

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:41.610
I still ask questions
in the lecture,

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:43.970
as you'll probably see.

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:48.110
But it's a little
harder for students

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:52.210
to shout out an answer,
so they can shout all

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:54.410
they want in their recitations.

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:57.690
With each lecture, we
produce a written summary

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:59.780
of what it's about.

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:02.950
So after you watch the lecture,
you could look at that summary

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:08.700
and it reinforces, remembering
the key points of the lecture.

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:13.170
And then we also added in
some problems, four or five

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:18.410
problems from the book that you
can just look at and see, OK,

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:20.570
do I know what the
question is here?

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:23.310
Do I know how to do it?

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:27.740
I think, as a result, you're
learning linear algebra.

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:29.790
A thought or two
about linear algebra

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:33.950
worldwide, because it
really is worldwide.

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:36.930
The feedback comes from
all over the world.

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:40.380
It's really nice to get.

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:42.550
Also, I enjoy going.

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:48.170
So if somebody invites me to
Egypt or Australia or China,

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:51.850
I tend to go if I can.

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:54.820
Because that's a lovely
part about mathematics.

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:57.580
It's really universal.

00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:01.110
It's a language
almost of its own

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:07.250
that everybody can
learn to speak.

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:11.160
And I hope these lectures help.

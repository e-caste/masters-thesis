[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:58.740
PROFESSOR: During the course,
we've developed a number of

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.220
very powerful and
useful tools.

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.519
And we've seen how these can
be used in designing and

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:05.970
analyzing systems.

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.750
For example, for filtering,
for modulation, et cetera.

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.380
I'd like to conclude this series
of lectures with an

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.670
introduction to one more
important topic.

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.320
Namely, the analysis of
feedback systems.

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.700
And one of the principle reasons
that we have left this

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.900
discussion to the last part of
the course is so that we can

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.570
exploit some of the ideas that
we've just developed in some

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.490
of the previous lectures.

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.350
Namely, the tools afforded us
by Laplace and z-transforms.

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:52.300
Now, as I had indicated in one
of the very first lectures, a

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:56.080
common example of a feedback
system is the problem of,

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.790
let's say balancing a broom, or
in the case of that lecture

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.480
balancing my son's horse in
the palm of your hand.

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:09.610
And kind of the idea there is
that what that relies on, in

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.320
order to make that a stable
system, is feedback.

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:17.680
In that particular case,
visual feedback.

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.470
That specific problem, the one
of balancing something, let's

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:26.230
say in the palm of your hand,
is an example of a problem,

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.880
which is commonly referred to
as the inverted pendulum.

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.250
And it's one that we will
actually be analyzing in a

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.400
fair amount of detail
not in this lecture,

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.820
but in the next lecture.

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.510
But let me just kind of indicate
what some of the

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.670
issues are.

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.030
Let me describe this in the
context not of balancing a

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.410
broom on your hand, but let's
say that we have a mechanical

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.730
system which consists
of a cart.

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.770
And the cart can move, let's say
in one dimension, and it

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:01.460
has mounted on it a bar, a rod
with a weight on the top, and

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:02.880
it pivots around the base.

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.510
So that essentially represents
the inverted pendulum.

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.510
So that system can be, more
or less, depicted as I've

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.210
indicated here.

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:16.650
And this is the cart that can
move along the x-axis.

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.660
And here we have a pivot
point, a rod, a

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.000
weight at the top.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.100
And then, of course, there are
several forces acting on this.

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:28.740
There is an acceleration that
can be applied to the cart,

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:33.290
and that will be thought of
as the external input.

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:37.130
And then on the pendulum itself,
on the weight, there

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:39.080
is the force of gravity.

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.130
And then typically, a set of
external disturbances that

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:46.840
might represent, for example,
air currents, or wind, or

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:53.630
whatever, that will attempt
to destabilize the system.

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:58.440
Specifically, to have the
pendulum fall down.

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.470
Now, if we look at this system
in, more or less, a

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:07.150
straightforward way, what we
have then are the system

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:14.200
dynamics and several inputs, one
of which is the external

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:19.570
disturbances and a second is the
acceleration, which is the

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:21.990
external acceleration
that's applied.

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:25.510
And the output of the system
can be thought of as the

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:27.590
angular displacement
of the pendulum.

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:31.330
Which if we want it balanced,
we would like that angular

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.430
displacement to be equal to 0.

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:39.330
Now, if we know exactly what the
system dynamics are and if

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:43.280
we knew exactly what the
external disturbances are,

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:46.500
then in principle, we could
design an acceleration.

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:47.850
Namely, an input.

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:51.710
That would exactly generate
0 output.

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:54.440
In other words, the angle
would be equal to 0.

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:58.750
But as you can imagine, just as
it's basically impossible

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:01.830
to balance a broom in the palm
of your hand with you eyes

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:08.030
closed, what is very hard to
ascertain in advance are what

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:11.100
the various dynamics and
disturbances are.

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:15.040
And so more typically what you
would think of doing is

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:20.130
measuring the output angle,
and then using that

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:24.220
measurement to somehow
influence the applied

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:25.920
acceleration or force.

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:29.670
And that, then, is an example
of a feedback system.

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:37.160
So we would measure the output
angle and generate an input

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:42.960
acceleration, which is some
function of what that

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:44.300
output angle is.

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:48.310
And if we choose the feedback
dynamics correctly, then in

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:52.430
fact, we can drive
this output to 0.

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:57.640
This is one example of a system
which is inherently

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:01.680
unstable because if we left
it to its own devices, the

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.760
pendulum would simply
fall down.

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:07.140
And essentially, by applying
feedback, what we're trying to

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:10.390
do is stabilize this inherently
unstable system.

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:13.560
And we'll talk a little bit
more about that specific

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:17.030
application of feedback
shortly.

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:21.400
Another common example of
feedback is in positioning or

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:26.460
tracking systems, and I indicate
one here which

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:31.790
corresponds to the problem of
positioning a telescope, which

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:34.000
is mounted on a rotating
platform.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.110
So in a system of that type, for
example, I indicate here

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:41.950
the rotating platform
and the telescope.

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:44.310
It's driven by a motor.

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:48.070
And again, we could imagine, in
principle, the possibility

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:53.320
of driving this to the desired
angle by choosing an

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:56.370
appropriate applied
input voltage.

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:59.230
And as long as we know such
things as what the

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:02.540
disturbances are that influence
the telescope mount

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:06.460
and what the characteristics of
the motor are, in principle

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:10.250
we could in fact carry this
out in a form which is

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:11.920
referred to as open loop.

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:16.280
Namely, we can choose an
appropriate input voltage to

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:22.020
drive the motor to set the
platform angle at the desired

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:24.450
angular position.

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:28.350
However, again, there are enough
unknowns in a problem

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:33.790
like that, so that one is
motivated to employ feedback.

00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:39.160
Namely, to make a measurement
of the output angle and use

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:44.430
that in a feedback loop to
influence the drive for the

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:49.410
motor, so that the telescope
platform is positioned

00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:50.610
appropriately.

00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:56.950
So if we look at this in a
feedback context, we would

00:07:56.950 --> 00:08:05.020
then take the measured output
angle and the measured output

00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:09.930
angle would be fed
back and compared

00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:12.810
with the desired angle.

00:08:12.810 --> 00:08:16.340
And the difference between
those, which essentially is

00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:19.240
the error between the platform
positioning and the desired

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:23.880
position would be put perhaps
through an appropriate gain or

00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:28.870
attenuation and used as the
excitation to the motor.

00:08:28.870 --> 00:08:32.659
So in the mechanical or physical
system, that would

00:08:32.659 --> 00:08:37.900
correspond to measuring the
angle, let's say with a

00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:39.169
potentiometer.

00:08:39.169 --> 00:08:42.770
So here we're measuring the
angle and we have an output,

00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:45.700
which is proportional to
that measured angle.

00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:52.290
And then we would use feedback,
comparing the

00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:57.670
measured angle to some
proportionality factor

00:08:57.670 --> 00:09:00.550
multiplying the desired angle.

00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:05.190
So here we have the desired
angle, again through some type

00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:06.660
of potentiometer.

00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:08.710
The two are compared.

00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:12.160
Out of the comparator, we
basically have an indication

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:14.890
of what the difference is, and
that represents an error

00:09:14.890 --> 00:09:17.230
between the desired and
the true angle.

00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:22.160
And then that is used through
perhaps an amplifier to

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:23.630
control the motor.

00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:28.240
And in that case, of course,
when the error goes to 0, that

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:29.960
means that the actual
angle and the

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:32.010
desired angle are equal.

00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:35.930
And in fact, in that case also
with this system, the input to

00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:40.210
the motor is, likewise,
equal to 0.

00:09:40.210 --> 00:09:44.520
Now, as I've illustrated it
here, it tends to be in the

00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:48.840
context of a continuous
time or analog system.

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:51.770
And in fact, another very
common way of doing

00:09:51.770 --> 00:09:58.890
positioning or tracking is to
instead implement the feedback

00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:02.300
using a discrete-time
or digital system.

00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:07.760
And so in that case, we would
basically take the position

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:13.310
output as it's measured, sample
it, essentially convert

00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:18.460
that to a digital discrete-time
signal.

00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:23.330
And then that is used in
conjunction with the desired

00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:30.060
angle, which both form inputs
to this processor.

00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:34.770
And the output of that is
converted, let's say, back to

00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:38.120
an analog or continuous-time
voltage and used

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:40.100
to drive the motor.

00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:45.040
Now, you could ask, why would
you go to a digital or

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:49.150
discrete-time measurement rather
than doing it the way I

00:10:49.150 --> 00:10:51.340
showed on the previous overlay
which seemed relatively

00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:52.530
straightforward?

00:10:52.530 --> 00:10:55.710
And the reason, principally,
is that in the context of a

00:10:55.710 --> 00:11:00.360
digital implementation of the
feedback process, often you

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:05.220
can implement a better
controlled and often also,

00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:10.140
more sophisticated algorithm
for the feedback dynamics.

00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:13.310
So that you can take a count,
perhaps not only of the angle

00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:16.970
itself, but also of the rate
of change of angle.

00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:18.720
And in fact, the rate of
change of the rate

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:21.270
of change of angle.

00:11:21.270 --> 00:11:27.230
So the system, as it's shown
there then, basically has a

00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:30.350
discrete-time or digital
feedback loop around a

00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:33.070
continuous time system.

00:11:33.070 --> 00:11:38.950
Now, this is an example of, in
fact, a more general way in

00:11:38.950 --> 00:11:42.590
which discrete-time
feedback is used

00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:44.950
with continuous systems.

00:11:44.950 --> 00:11:50.950
And let me indicate, in general,
what the character or

00:11:50.950 --> 00:11:53.510
block diagram of such
a system might be.

00:11:53.510 --> 00:11:57.860
Typically, if we abstract away
from the telescope positioning

00:11:57.860 --> 00:12:01.420
system, we might have
a more general

00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:03.730
continuous-time system.

00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:07.980
And around which we want to
apply some feedback, which we

00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:10.920
could do with a continuous-time
system or with

00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:16.150
a discrete-time system by first
converting these signals

00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:20.310
to discrete-time signals.

00:12:20.310 --> 00:12:24.620
Then, processing that with
a discrete-time system.

00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:27.440
And then, through an appropriate
interpolation

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:32.670
algorithm, we would then
convert that back to a

00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:34.580
continuous-time signal.

00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:39.030
And the difference between
the input signal and this

00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:42.270
continuous-time signal which
is fed back, then forms the

00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:45.220
excitation to the system
that essentially

00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:46.870
we're trying to control.

00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:52.280
And in many systems of this
type, the advantage is that

00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:56.710
this system can be implemented
in a very reproducible way,

00:12:56.710 --> 00:13:01.240
either with a digital computer
or with a microprocessor.

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:06.110
And although we're not going to
go into this in any detail

00:13:06.110 --> 00:13:08.850
in this lecture, there
is some discussion

00:13:08.850 --> 00:13:10.580
of this in the text.

00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:14.370
Essentially, if we make certain
assumptions about this

00:13:14.370 --> 00:13:19.980
particular feedback system, we
can move the continuous to

00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:25.340
discrete-time converter up to
this point and to this point,

00:13:25.340 --> 00:13:30.060
and we can move the
interpolating system outside

00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:31.500
the summer.

00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:37.220
And what happens in that case
is that we end up with what

00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:42.730
looks like an inherently
discrete-time feedback system.

00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:46.280
So, in fact, if we take those
steps, then what we'll end up

00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:52.260
with for a feedback system is a
system that essentially can

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:55.890
be analyzed as a discrete-time
system.

00:13:55.890 --> 00:14:00.820
Here we have what is, in the
forward path, is basically the

00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:04.550
continuous-time system with the
interpolator at one end

00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:06.450
and the continuous to
discrete-time converter

00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:07.700
at the other end.

00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:11.640
And then we have whatever system
it was in the feedback

00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:13.090
loop-- discrete-time--

00:14:13.090 --> 00:14:16.900
that shows up in this
feedback loop.

00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:21.410
Well, I show this mainly to
emphasize the fact, although

00:14:21.410 --> 00:14:24.500
there are some steps there that
we obviously left out.

00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:27.080
I show that mainly to emphasize
the fact that

00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:30.890
feedback arises not just in the
context of continuous-time

00:14:30.890 --> 00:14:36.140
systems, but also the analysis
of discrete-time feedback

00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:38.240
systems becomes important.

00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:42.600
Perhaps because we have used
discrete-time feedback around

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:44.540
a continuous-time system.

00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:49.850
But also perhaps because the
feedback system is inherently

00:14:49.850 --> 00:14:50.660
discrete-time.

00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:54.980
And let me just illustrate one,
or indicate one example

00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:57.850
in which that might arise.

00:14:57.850 --> 00:15:03.290
This is an example which is
also discussed in somewhat

00:15:03.290 --> 00:15:05.270
more detail in the text.

00:15:05.270 --> 00:15:09.990
But basically, population
studies, for example,

00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:12.480
represent examples of

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:14.840
discrete-time feedback systems.

00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:19.590
Where let's say that we have
some type of model for

00:15:19.590 --> 00:15:21.200
population growth.

00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:25.180
And since people come in
integer amounts that

00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:30.950
represents essentially the
output of any population

00:15:30.950 --> 00:15:33.080
model, essentially
or inherently

00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:34.330
represents a sequence.

00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:38.630
Namely, it's indexed on
an integer variable.

00:15:38.630 --> 00:15:42.810
And typically, models for
population growth

00:15:42.810 --> 00:15:44.720
are unstable systems.

00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:48.240
You can kind of imagine that
because if you take these

00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:52.950
simple models of population,
what happens is that in any

00:15:52.950 --> 00:15:59.050
generation, the number of
people, or animals, or

00:15:59.050 --> 00:16:02.590
whatever it is that this is
modeling, grows essentially

00:16:02.590 --> 00:16:07.750
exponentially with the size of
the previous generation.

00:16:07.750 --> 00:16:09.360
Now, where does the
feedback come in?

00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:14.370
Well, the feedback typically
comes in, in incorporating in

00:16:14.370 --> 00:16:17.090
the overall model various
retarding factors.

00:16:17.090 --> 00:16:20.920
For example, as the population
increases, the food supply

00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:22.360
becomes more limited.

00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:30.030
And that essentially is a
feedback process that acts to

00:16:30.030 --> 00:16:32.510
retard the population growth.

00:16:32.510 --> 00:16:35.360
And so an overall model--

00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:36.610
somewhat simplified--

00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:44.170
for a population system is the
open loop model in the absence

00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:46.270
of retarding factors.

00:16:46.270 --> 00:16:50.200
And then, very often the
retarding factors can be

00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:55.490
described as being related to
the size of the population.

00:16:55.490 --> 00:17:02.210
And those essentially act to
reduce the overall input to

00:17:02.210 --> 00:17:04.060
the population model.

00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:09.560
And so population studies are
one very common example of

00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:11.205
discrete-time feedback
systems.

00:17:14.839 --> 00:17:19.720
Well, what we want to look at
and understand are the basic

00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:23.030
properties of feedback
systems.

00:17:23.030 --> 00:17:27.910
And to do that, let's look at
the basic block diagram and

00:17:27.910 --> 00:17:30.530
equations for feedback
systems, either

00:17:30.530 --> 00:17:33.820
continuous-time or
discrete-time.

00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:38.540
Let's begin with the
continuous-time case.

00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:44.670
And now what we've done is
simply abstract out any of the

00:17:44.670 --> 00:17:49.150
applications to a fairly general
system, in which we

00:17:49.150 --> 00:17:54.980
have a system H of s in what's
referred to as the forward

00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:59.590
path, and a system G of s
in the feedback path.

00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:07.600
The input to the system H of s
is the difference between the

00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:11.320
input to the overall system
and the output of

00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:13.020
the feedback loop.

00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:17.020
And I draw your attention
to the fact that what we

00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:18.440
illustrate here and what we're

00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:20.710
analyzing is negative feedback.

00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:25.010
Namely, this output is
subtracted from the input.

00:18:25.010 --> 00:18:29.170
And that's done more for reasons
of convention then for

00:18:29.170 --> 00:18:30.370
any other reasons.

00:18:30.370 --> 00:18:34.770
It's typical to do that and
appropriate certainly in some

00:18:34.770 --> 00:18:37.040
feedback systems, but not all.

00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:41.350
And the output of the adder is
commonly referred to as the

00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:44.400
error signal, indicating that
it's the difference between

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:49.280
the signal fed back and the
input to the overall system.

00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:53.310
Now, if we want to analyze the
feedback system, we would do

00:18:53.310 --> 00:18:55.540
that essentially by writing
the appropriate equations.

00:18:58.460 --> 00:19:01.220
In generating the equivalent
system function for the

00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:06.780
overall system, it's best done
in the frequency or Laplace

00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:10.290
transform domain rather than
in the time domain.

00:19:10.290 --> 00:19:12.330
And let me just indicate
what the steps

00:19:12.330 --> 00:19:13.420
are that are involved.

00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:17.260
And there are a few steps of
algebra that I'll leave in

00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:18.480
your hands.

00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:23.440
But basically, if we look at
this feedback system, we can

00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:27.610
label, of course-- since the
output is y of t, we can label

00:19:27.610 --> 00:19:31.080
the Laplace transform of
the output as Y of s.

00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:35.330
And we also have Y of
s as the input here.

00:19:35.330 --> 00:19:38.520
Because this is the system
function, the Laplace

00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:42.620
transform of r of t is simply
the Laplace transform of this

00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:45.330
input, which is Y of
s times G of s.

00:19:45.330 --> 00:19:50.410
So here we have Y of
s times G of s.

00:19:50.410 --> 00:19:55.940
At the adder, the input
here is x of s.

00:19:55.940 --> 00:20:01.110
And so the Laplace transform of
the error signal is simply

00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:08.070
x of s minus r of s, which
is Y of s G of s.

00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:12.440
So this is minus
Y of s G of s.

00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:15.580
That's the Laplace transform
of the error signal.

00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:20.400
The Laplace transform of the
output of this system is

00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:25.970
simply this expression
times H of s.

00:20:25.970 --> 00:20:27.690
So that's what we have here.

00:20:27.690 --> 00:20:30.820
But what we have here we
already called Y of s.

00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:35.600
So in fact, we can simply say
that these two expressions

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:37.180
have to be equal.

00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:41.020
And so we've essentially done
the analysis, saying that

00:20:41.020 --> 00:20:43.150
those two expressions
are equal.

00:20:43.150 --> 00:20:47.440
Let's solve for Y of s over x
of s, which is the overall

00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:48.940
system function.

00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:52.970
And if we do that, what we end
up with for the overall system

00:20:52.970 --> 00:20:55.820
function is the algebraic
expression

00:20:55.820 --> 00:20:56.910
that I indicate here.

00:20:56.910 --> 00:21:02.840
It's H of s divided by
1 plus G of s H of s.

00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:07.470
Said another way, it's the
system function in the open

00:21:07.470 --> 00:21:14.070
loop forward path divided by 1
plus, what's referred to as

00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:17.150
the loop gain, G of
s times H of s.

00:21:17.150 --> 00:21:19.990
Let's just look back up
at the block diagram.

00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:26.660
G of s times H of s is simply
the gain around the entire

00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:30.760
loop from this point around
to this point.

00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:34.820
So the overall system function
is the gain in the forward

00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:39.770
path divided by 1 plus the loop
gain, which is H of s

00:21:39.770 --> 00:21:42.430
times G of s.

00:21:42.430 --> 00:21:46.540
Now, none of the equations
that we wrote had relied

00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:48.490
specifically on this being
continuous-time.

00:21:48.490 --> 00:21:52.120
We just did some algebra and
we used the system function

00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:53.770
property of the systems.

00:21:53.770 --> 00:21:58.620
And so, pretty obviously, the
same kind of algebraic

00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:01.990
procedure would work
in discrete-time.

00:22:01.990 --> 00:22:07.250
And so, in fact, if we carried
out a discrete-time analysis

00:22:07.250 --> 00:22:11.290
rather than a continuous-time
analysis, we would simply end

00:22:11.290 --> 00:22:18.600
up with exactly the same system
and exactly the same

00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:24.600
equation for the overall
system function.

00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:28.130
The only difference being that
here things are a function of

00:22:28.130 --> 00:22:31.840
z, whereas if I just
flip back the other

00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:34.880
overlay, we simply have--

00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:39.070
previously everything is
function of t and in the

00:22:39.070 --> 00:22:41.050
frequency domain s.

00:22:41.050 --> 00:22:45.980
In the discrete-time case, we've
simply replaced in the

00:22:45.980 --> 00:22:48.920
time domain, the independent
variable by n.

00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:54.830
And in the frequency domain, the
independent variable by z.

00:22:54.830 --> 00:23:02.440
So what we see is that we have a
basic feedback equation, and

00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:04.990
that feedback equation is
exactly the same for

00:23:04.990 --> 00:23:07.590
continuous-time and
discrete-time.

00:23:07.590 --> 00:23:10.880
Although we have to be careful
about what implications we

00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:14.150
draw, depending on whether
we're talking about

00:23:14.150 --> 00:23:15.950
continuous-time or
discrete-time.

00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:24.660
Now, to illustrate the
importance of feedback, let's

00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:28.750
look at a number of common
applications.

00:23:28.750 --> 00:23:31.820
And also, as we talk about these
applications, what will

00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:36.580
see is that while these
applications and context in

00:23:36.580 --> 00:23:41.800
which feedback is used are
extremely useful and powerful,

00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:47.090
they fall out in an almost
straightforward way from this

00:23:47.090 --> 00:23:52.090
very simple feedback equation
that we've just derrived.

00:23:52.090 --> 00:23:57.590
Well, the examples that I want
to just talk about are, first

00:23:57.590 --> 00:24:01.930
of all, the use of feedback
in amplifier design.

00:24:01.930 --> 00:24:05.980
And we're not going to design
amplifiers in detail, but what

00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:11.050
I'd like to illustrate is the
basic principle behind why

00:24:11.050 --> 00:24:14.740
feedback is useful in designing
amplifiers.

00:24:14.740 --> 00:24:19.840
In particular, how it plays a
role in compensating for a

00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:22.640
non-constant frequency
response.

00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:25.880
So that's one context that
we'll talk about.

00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:30.390
A second that I'll indicate
is the use of feedback for

00:24:30.390 --> 00:24:33.890
implementing inverse systems.

00:24:33.890 --> 00:24:38.340
And the third, which we
indicated in the case of the

00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:42.150
inverted pendulum, is an
important context in which

00:24:42.150 --> 00:24:45.860
feedback is used is in
stabilizing unstable systems.

00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:52.960
And what we want to see is why
or how a feedback system or

00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:56.720
the basic feedback equation, in
fact, let's us do each of

00:24:56.720 --> 00:24:59.090
these various things.

00:24:59.090 --> 00:25:03.140
Well, let's begin with
amplifier design.

00:25:03.140 --> 00:25:07.960
And let's suppose that we've
built somehow without

00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:13.380
feedback, an amplifier that is
terrific in terms of its gain,

00:25:13.380 --> 00:25:17.690
but has the problem that whereas
we might like the

00:25:17.690 --> 00:25:21.760
amplifier to have a very flat
frequency response, in fact

00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:26.200
the frequency response of this
amplifier is not constant.

00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:29.290
And what we'd like to do
is compensate for that.

00:25:29.290 --> 00:25:32.430
Well, it turns out,
interestingly, that if we

00:25:32.430 --> 00:25:38.250
embed the amplifier in a
feedback loop where in the

00:25:38.250 --> 00:25:42.640
feedback path we incorporate an
attenuator, then in fact,

00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:44.250
we can compensate for that

00:25:44.250 --> 00:25:46.500
non-constant frequency response.

00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:47.910
Well, let's see how that
works out from

00:25:47.910 --> 00:25:49.990
the feedback equation.

00:25:49.990 --> 00:25:53.060
We have the basic feedback
equation that we derived.

00:25:53.060 --> 00:25:55.900
And we want to look at frequency
response, so we'll

00:25:55.900 --> 00:25:58.620
look specifically at the
Fourier transform.

00:25:58.620 --> 00:26:02.450
And of course, the frequency
response of the overall system

00:26:02.450 --> 00:26:05.920
is the frequency response of the
Fourier transform of the

00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:08.260
output divided by the input.

00:26:08.260 --> 00:26:11.960
Using the feedback equation that
we had just arrived, that

00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:15.430
has, in the numerator, the
frequency response in the

00:26:15.430 --> 00:26:21.470
forward path divided by 1 plus
the loop gain, which is H of j

00:26:21.470 --> 00:26:23.430
omega times k.

00:26:23.430 --> 00:26:24.920
And this is the key.

00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:32.830
Because here, if we choose k
times H of j omega to be very

00:26:32.830 --> 00:26:38.170
large, much larger than 1,
then what happens is that

00:26:38.170 --> 00:26:41.720
these two cancel out.

00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:46.380
H of j omega here and in the
denominator will cancel out as

00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:48.590
long as this term dominates.

00:26:48.590 --> 00:26:52.240
And in that case, under that
assumption, the overall system

00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:54.650
function is approximately 1/k.

00:26:57.260 --> 00:27:04.360
Well, if k is constant as a
function of frequency, then we

00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:08.320
somehow magically have ended up
with an amplifier that has

00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:11.210
a flat frequency response.

00:27:11.210 --> 00:27:14.190
Well, it seems like we're
getting something for nothing.

00:27:14.190 --> 00:27:15.840
And actually, we're not.

00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:17.850
There's a price that
we pay for that.

00:27:17.850 --> 00:27:24.110
Because notice the fact that
in order to get gain out of

00:27:24.110 --> 00:27:29.390
the overall system, k
must be less than 1.

00:27:29.390 --> 00:27:32.660
So this has to correspond
to attenuator.

00:27:32.660 --> 00:27:37.680
And we also require that k,
which is less than 1, times

00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:40.940
the gain of the original
amplifier, that that product

00:27:40.940 --> 00:27:42.340
be greater than 1.

00:27:42.340 --> 00:27:45.370
And the implication of this,
without tracking it in detail

00:27:45.370 --> 00:27:49.930
right now, the implication in
this is that whereas we

00:27:49.930 --> 00:27:53.990
flatten the frequency response,
we have in fact paid

00:27:53.990 --> 00:27:54.680
a price for that.

00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:58.030
The price that we've paid is
that the gain is somewhat

00:27:58.030 --> 00:28:01.880
reduced from the gain that we
had before the feedback.

00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:07.710
Because k times h must be much
larger than 1, but the gain is

00:28:07.710 --> 00:28:09.250
proportional to 1/k.

00:28:09.250 --> 00:28:12.640
Now, one last point to
make related to that.

00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:17.080
One could ask, well, why is it
any easier to make k flat with

00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:21.920
frequency than to build an
amplifier with a flat

00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:23.350
frequency response?

00:28:23.350 --> 00:28:28.040
The reason is that the gain
in the feedback path is an

00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:30.280
attenuator, not an amplifier.

00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:34.930
And generally, attenuation with
a flat frequency response

00:28:34.930 --> 00:28:37.460
is much easier to get
than gain is.

00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:43.820
For example, a resistor, which
attenuates, would generally

00:28:43.820 --> 00:28:45.510
have a flatter frequency
response than a

00:28:45.510 --> 00:28:48.650
very high-gain amplifier.

00:28:48.650 --> 00:28:52.390
So that's one common example
of feedback.

00:28:52.390 --> 00:28:57.310
And feedback, in fact, is very
often used in high-quality

00:28:57.310 --> 00:28:59.210
amplifier systems.

00:28:59.210 --> 00:29:04.660
Another very common example in
which feedback is used is in

00:29:04.660 --> 00:29:08.230
implementing inverse systems.

00:29:08.230 --> 00:29:13.220
Now, what I mean by that is,
suppose that we have a system,

00:29:13.220 --> 00:29:15.400
which I indicate
here, P of s--

00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:17.250
input and output.

00:29:17.250 --> 00:29:21.710
And what we would like to do is
implement a system which is

00:29:21.710 --> 00:29:23.610
the inverse of this system.

00:29:23.610 --> 00:29:28.630
Namely, has a Laplace transform
or system function

00:29:28.630 --> 00:29:31.980
which is 1 over P of s.

00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:36.640
For example, we may have
measured a particular system

00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:38.590
and what we would like
to design is a

00:29:38.590 --> 00:29:40.140
compensator for it.

00:29:40.140 --> 00:29:42.930
And the question is, by putting
this in a feedback

00:29:42.930 --> 00:29:46.660
loop, can we, in fact,
implement the

00:29:46.660 --> 00:29:48.360
inverse of this system?

00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:50.580
The answer to that is yes.

00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:53.780
And the feedback system,
in that case, is

00:29:53.780 --> 00:29:55.900
as I indicate here.

00:29:55.900 --> 00:30:01.570
So here what we choose to do
is to put the system whose

00:30:01.570 --> 00:30:06.050
inverse we're trying to generate
in the feedback loop.

00:30:06.050 --> 00:30:10.960
And in this case, a high-gain
in the forward path.

00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:14.430
Now for this situation, k
is, again, a constant.

00:30:14.430 --> 00:30:16.970
But in fact, it's a high-gain
constant.

00:30:16.970 --> 00:30:20.460
And now if we look at the
feedback equation, then what

00:30:20.460 --> 00:30:24.210
we see is an equation
of this form.

00:30:24.210 --> 00:30:30.950
And notice that if k times P
of s is large compared with

00:30:30.950 --> 00:30:35.340
one, then this term dominates.

00:30:35.340 --> 00:30:38.700
The gain in the forward
path cancels out.

00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:44.360
And what we're left with is a
system function, which is just

00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:46.960
1 over P of s.

00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:51.552
And a system of this
type is used in a

00:30:51.552 --> 00:30:52.970
whole variety of contexts.

00:30:52.970 --> 00:30:56.910
One very common one is in
building what are called

00:30:56.910 --> 00:31:00.460
logarithmic devices or
logarithmic amplifiers.

00:31:00.460 --> 00:31:04.730
Ones in which the input-output
characteristic is logarithmic.

00:31:04.730 --> 00:31:09.260
It's common to do that with a
diode that has an exponential

00:31:09.260 --> 00:31:10.630
characteristic.

00:31:10.630 --> 00:31:14.580
And using that with feedback--

00:31:14.580 --> 00:31:17.800
as feedback around a high-gain
operational amplifier.

00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:20.570
And by the way, the logarithmic

00:31:20.570 --> 00:31:22.170
amplifier is nonlinear.

00:31:22.170 --> 00:31:24.440
What I've said here
is linear, or the

00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:26.170
analysis here was linear.

00:31:26.170 --> 00:31:29.790
But that example, in fact,
suggests something which is

00:31:29.790 --> 00:31:35.750
true, which is that same basic
idea, in fact, can be used

00:31:35.750 --> 00:31:38.520
often in the context of
nonlinear feedback and

00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:39.845
nonlinear feedback systems.

00:31:42.580 --> 00:31:48.760
Well, as a final example, what
I'd like to analyze is the

00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:52.520
context in which we
would consider

00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:56.230
stabilizing unstable systems.

00:31:56.230 --> 00:32:00.360
And I had indicated that one
context in which that arises

00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:06.250
and which we will be analyzing
in the next lecture is the

00:32:06.250 --> 00:32:07.930
inverted pendulum.

00:32:07.930 --> 00:32:12.230
And in that situation, or in
a situation where we're

00:32:12.230 --> 00:32:16.430
attempting to stabilize an
unstable system, we have now

00:32:16.430 --> 00:32:22.120
in the forward path a system
which is unstable.

00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:27.420
And in the feedback path,
we've put an appropriate

00:32:27.420 --> 00:32:33.000
system so that the overall
system, in fact, is stable.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:38.480
Now, how can stability arise
out of having an initially

00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:40.020
unstable system?

00:32:40.020 --> 00:32:45.110
Well, again, if we look at the
basic feedback equation, the

00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:48.690
overall system function is the
system function for the

00:32:48.690 --> 00:32:52.840
forward path divided by 1
plus the loop gain, G of

00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:55.070
s times H of s.

00:32:55.070 --> 00:32:59.790
And for stability what we want
to examine are the roots of 1

00:32:59.790 --> 00:33:02.030
plus G of s times H of s.

00:33:02.030 --> 00:33:08.880
And in particular, the poles are
the zeroes of that factor.

00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:12.720
And as long as we choose
G of s, so that the

00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:15.490
poles of this term--

00:33:15.490 --> 00:33:21.700
I'm sorry, so that the zeroes
of this term are in the left

00:33:21.700 --> 00:33:24.100
half of the s-plane,
then what we'll

00:33:24.100 --> 00:33:25.730
end up with is stability.

00:33:25.730 --> 00:33:29.530
So stability is dependent not
just on h of s for the

00:33:29.530 --> 00:33:34.310
closed-loop system, but on 1
plus G of s times H of s.

00:33:34.310 --> 00:33:40.860
And this kind of notion is used
in lots of situations.

00:33:40.860 --> 00:33:42.610
I indicated the inverted
pendulum.

00:33:42.610 --> 00:33:47.780
Another very common example is
in some very high-performance

00:33:47.780 --> 00:33:52.910
aircraft where the basic
aircraft system

00:33:52.910 --> 00:33:55.060
is an unstable system.

00:33:55.060 --> 00:33:59.800
But in fact, it's stabilized by
putting the right kind of

00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:02.530
feedback dynamics around it.

00:34:02.530 --> 00:34:05.200
And those feedback dynamics
might, in fact, involve the

00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:07.870
pilot as well.

00:34:07.870 --> 00:34:17.790
Now, for the system that we
just talked about, the

00:34:17.790 --> 00:34:22.520
stability was described
in terms of a

00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:24.449
continuous-time system.

00:34:24.449 --> 00:34:27.540
And the stability condition
that we end up with, of

00:34:27.540 --> 00:34:32.710
course, relates to the zeroes
of this denominator term.

00:34:32.710 --> 00:34:36.850
And we require for stability
that the real parts of the

00:34:36.850 --> 00:34:41.600
associated roots be in the
left half of the s-plane.

00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:44.610
Exactly the same kind of
analysis, in terms of

00:34:44.610 --> 00:34:48.690
stability, applies
in discrete-time.

00:34:48.690 --> 00:34:55.580
That is, in discrete-time, as
we saw previously, the basic

00:34:55.580 --> 00:34:58.630
discrete-time feedback system
is exactly the same, except

00:34:58.630 --> 00:35:02.060
that the independent variable
is now an integer variable

00:35:02.060 --> 00:35:04.320
rather than a continuous
variable.

00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:07.460
The feedback equation
is exactly the same.

00:35:07.460 --> 00:35:11.750
So to analyze stability of the
feedback system, we would want

00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:17.080
to look at the zeroes of 1
plus G of z times H of z.

00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:21.250
So again, it's those zeroes
that affect stability.

00:35:21.250 --> 00:35:25.580
And the principal difference
between the continuous-time

00:35:25.580 --> 00:35:30.550
and discrete-time cases is the
fact that the stability

00:35:30.550 --> 00:35:35.220
condition in discrete-time is
different than it is in

00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:36.030
continuous-time.

00:35:36.030 --> 00:35:42.270
Namely, in continuous-time, we
care for stability about poles

00:35:42.270 --> 00:35:46.960
of the overall system being in
the left half of the s-plane

00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:48.690
or the right half
of the s-plane.

00:35:48.690 --> 00:35:53.060
In discrete-time, what we care
about is whether the poles are

00:35:53.060 --> 00:35:55.420
inside or outside
the unit circle.

00:35:55.420 --> 00:36:00.530
So in the discrete-time case,
what we would impose for

00:36:00.530 --> 00:36:04.390
stability is that the zeroes
have a magnitude which

00:36:04.390 --> 00:36:06.060
is less than 1.

00:36:06.060 --> 00:36:12.090
So the basic analysis is the
same, but the details of the

00:36:12.090 --> 00:36:15.700
stability condition, of
course, are different.

00:36:15.700 --> 00:36:22.660
Now, what I've just indicated
is that feedback can be used

00:36:22.660 --> 00:36:27.200
to stabilize an unstable
system.

00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:30.660
And as you can imagine there's
the other side of the coin.

00:36:30.660 --> 00:36:37.120
Namely, if you start with a
stable system and put feedback

00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:40.300
around it, if you're not careful
what can happen, in

00:36:40.300 --> 00:36:43.170
fact, is that you can
destabilize the system.

00:36:43.170 --> 00:36:46.380
So there's always the potential
hazard, unless it's

00:36:46.380 --> 00:36:50.610
something you want to have
happen, that feedback around

00:36:50.610 --> 00:36:54.140
what used to be a stable system
now generates a system

00:36:54.140 --> 00:36:55.520
which is unstable.

00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:57.860
And there are lots of
examples of that.

00:36:57.860 --> 00:37:01.910
One very common example
is in audio systems.

00:37:01.910 --> 00:37:04.800
And this is probably an example
that you're somewhat

00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:06.880
familiar with.

00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:12.550
Basically, an audio system, if
you have the speaker and the

00:37:12.550 --> 00:37:15.980
microphone in any kind of
proximity to each other is, in

00:37:15.980 --> 00:37:18.190
fact, a feedback system.

00:37:18.190 --> 00:37:23.590
Well, first of all, the audio
input to the microphone

00:37:23.590 --> 00:37:31.360
consists of the external audio
inputs, and the external audio

00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:35.360
inputs might, for example,
be my voice.

00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:37.580
It might be the room noise.

00:37:37.580 --> 00:37:40.140
And in fact, as we'll illustrate
shortly if I'm not

00:37:40.140 --> 00:37:44.490
careful, might in fact be the
output from a speaker, which

00:37:44.490 --> 00:37:46.360
represents feedback.

00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:52.410
That audio, of course, after
appropriate amplification

00:37:52.410 --> 00:37:56.680
drives a speaker.

00:37:56.680 --> 00:38:02.730
And if, in fact, the speaker
is, let's say has any

00:38:02.730 --> 00:38:07.580
proximity to the microphone,
then there can be a certain

00:38:07.580 --> 00:38:13.200
amount of the output of the
speaker that feeds back around

00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:18.560
and is fed back into
the microphone.

00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:22.200
Now, the system function
associated with the feedback I

00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:26.280
indicate here as a constant
times e to the minus s times

00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:30.940
capital T. The e to the minus
s times capital T represents

00:38:30.940 --> 00:38:36.690
the fact that there is, in
general, some delay between

00:38:36.690 --> 00:38:41.110
the time delay between the
speaker output and the input

00:38:41.110 --> 00:38:43.730
that it generates to
the microphone.

00:38:43.730 --> 00:38:47.410
The reason for that delay of
course, being that there may

00:38:47.410 --> 00:38:50.570
be some distance between the
speaker and the microphone.

00:38:50.570 --> 00:38:54.850
And then the constant K2 that
I have in the feedback path

00:38:54.850 --> 00:38:57.580
represents the fact that between
the speaker and the

00:38:57.580 --> 00:39:01.050
microphone, there may
be some attenuation.

00:39:01.050 --> 00:39:04.970
So if I have, for example, a
speaker as I happen to have

00:39:04.970 --> 00:39:13.970
here, and I were to have that
speaker putting out what in

00:39:13.970 --> 00:39:16.120
fact I'm putting into the
microphone, or the output of

00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:19.640
the microphone, then what we
have is a feedback path.

00:39:19.640 --> 00:39:23.050
And the feedback path is from
the microphone, through the

00:39:23.050 --> 00:39:26.990
speaker, out of the speaker,
back into the microphone.

00:39:26.990 --> 00:39:32.700
And the feedback path is from
here to the microphone.

00:39:32.700 --> 00:39:36.230
And the characteristics or
frequency response or system

00:39:36.230 --> 00:39:39.390
function is associated with
the characteristics of

00:39:39.390 --> 00:39:41.580
propagation or transmission.

00:39:41.580 --> 00:39:44.440
If I were to move closer to the
speaker and I, by the way,

00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:46.825
don't have the speaker
on right now.

00:39:46.825 --> 00:39:50.690
And I'm sure you all
understand why.

00:39:50.690 --> 00:39:58.480
If I move closer, then the
constant K2 gets what?

00:39:58.480 --> 00:39:59.750
Gets larger.

00:39:59.750 --> 00:40:04.040
And if I move further away the
constant K2 gets smaller.

00:40:04.040 --> 00:40:08.120
Well, let's look at an analysis
of this and see what

00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:11.020
it is, or why it is, that
in fact we get an

00:40:11.020 --> 00:40:12.970
instability in terms--

00:40:12.970 --> 00:40:15.420
or that an instability is
predicted by the basic

00:40:15.420 --> 00:40:17.550
feedback equation.

00:40:17.550 --> 00:40:20.760
Now, notice first of all, that
we're talking about positive

00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:22.160
feedback here.

00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:27.210
And just simply substituting
the appropriate system

00:40:27.210 --> 00:40:31.690
functions into our basic
feedback equation, we have an

00:40:31.690 --> 00:40:35.180
equation that says that the
overall system function is

00:40:35.180 --> 00:40:38.260
given by the forward gain,
which is the gain of the

00:40:38.260 --> 00:40:42.040
amplifier between the microphone
and the speaker,

00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:45.190
divided by 1 minus--

00:40:45.190 --> 00:40:48.120
and the minus because we have
positive feedback--

00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:52.350
the overall loop gain, which
is K1, K2, e to the minus s

00:40:52.350 --> 00:40:58.000
capital T. And these two gains,
K1 and K2 are assumed

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:01.030
to be positive, and generally
are positive.

00:41:01.030 --> 00:41:06.280
So in order for us to--

00:41:06.280 --> 00:41:09.620
well, if we want to look at the
poles of the system, then

00:41:09.620 --> 00:41:12.770
we want to look at the zeroes
of this denominator.

00:41:12.770 --> 00:41:16.190
And the zeroes of this
denominator occur at values of

00:41:16.190 --> 00:41:21.000
s such that e to the minus s
capital T is equal to 1 over

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:23.020
K1 times K2.

00:41:23.020 --> 00:41:28.940
And equivalently that says that
the poles of the closed

00:41:28.940 --> 00:41:35.260
loop system occur at 1 over
capital T, and capital T is

00:41:35.260 --> 00:41:37.220
related to the time delay.

00:41:37.220 --> 00:41:43.460
1 over capital T times the log
to the base e of K1 times K2.

00:41:43.460 --> 00:41:47.880
Well, for stability we want
these poles to all be in the

00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:49.800
left half of the s-plane.

00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:54.040
And what that means then is
that for stability what we

00:41:54.040 --> 00:41:59.010
require is that K1 times
K2 be less than 1.

00:41:59.010 --> 00:42:02.840
In other words, we require that
the overall loop gain be

00:42:02.840 --> 00:42:06.100
less-- the magnitude of the
loop gain be less than 1.

00:42:06.100 --> 00:42:09.620
If it's not, then what we
generate is an instability.

00:42:09.620 --> 00:42:13.990
And just to illustrate that,
let's turn the speaker on.

00:42:13.990 --> 00:42:18.090
And what we'll demonstrate
is feedback.

00:42:18.090 --> 00:42:20.340
Right now the system
is stable.

00:42:20.340 --> 00:42:23.320
And I'm being careful to keep my
distance from the speaker.

00:42:23.320 --> 00:42:29.090
As I get closer, K2
will increase.

00:42:29.090 --> 00:42:33.280
And as K2 increases, eventually
the poles will move

00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:36.640
into the right half of the
s-plane, or they'll try to.

00:42:36.640 --> 00:42:39.060
What will happen is that the
system will start to oscillate

00:42:39.060 --> 00:42:41.230
and go into nonlinear
distortion.

00:42:41.230 --> 00:42:46.350
So as I get closer, you can hear
that we get feedback, we

00:42:46.350 --> 00:42:48.010
get oscillation.

00:42:48.010 --> 00:42:53.250
And I guess neither you nor I
can take too much of that.

00:42:53.250 --> 00:42:58.120
But you can see that
what's happening--

00:42:58.120 --> 00:43:00.680
if we can just turn the
speaker off now.

00:43:00.680 --> 00:43:05.310
You can see that what's
happening is that as K2

00:43:05.310 --> 00:43:10.660
increases, the poles are moving
on to the j omega axis,

00:43:10.660 --> 00:43:12.490
the system starts
to oscillate.

00:43:12.490 --> 00:43:15.450
They won't actually move into
the right half plane because

00:43:15.450 --> 00:43:19.650
there are nonlinearities that
inherently control the system.

00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:31.010
OK, so what we've seen in
today's lecture is the basic

00:43:31.010 --> 00:43:34.950
analysis equation and a few
of the applications.

00:43:34.950 --> 00:43:39.960
And one application, or one both
application and hazard

00:43:39.960 --> 00:43:44.870
that we've talked about, is the
application in which we

00:43:44.870 --> 00:43:47.170
may stabilize unstable
systems.

00:43:47.170 --> 00:43:51.580
Or if we're not careful,
destabilize stable systems.

00:43:51.580 --> 00:43:55.560
As I've indicated at several
times during the lecture, one

00:43:55.560 --> 00:44:01.210
common example of an unstable
system which feedback can be

00:44:01.210 --> 00:44:05.970
used to stabilize is the
inverted pendulum, which I've

00:44:05.970 --> 00:44:08.090
referred to several times.

00:44:08.090 --> 00:44:13.210
And in the next lecture, what
I'd like to do is focus in on

00:44:13.210 --> 00:44:15.410
a more detailed analysis
of this.

00:44:15.410 --> 00:44:20.860
And what we'll see, in fact, is
that the feedback dynamics,

00:44:20.860 --> 00:44:24.760
the form of the feedback
dynamics are important with

00:44:24.760 --> 00:44:27.750
regard to whether you can and
can't stabilize the system.

00:44:27.750 --> 00:44:30.630
Interestingly enough, for this
particular system, as we'll

00:44:30.630 --> 00:44:34.520
see in the next lecture, if you
simply try to measure the

00:44:34.520 --> 00:44:40.030
angle and feed that back that,
in fact, you can't stabilize

00:44:40.030 --> 00:44:40.780
the system.

00:44:40.780 --> 00:44:45.140
What it requires is not only
the angle, but some

00:44:45.140 --> 00:44:47.870
information about the rate
of change of angle.

00:44:47.870 --> 00:44:49.760
But we'll see that in much more

00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:51.120
detail in the next lecture.

00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:52.370
Thank you.

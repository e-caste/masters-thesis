WEBVTT

00:00:00.917 --> 00:00:01.500
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:14.020
Let me then say a little
more about that extra term.

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:18.020
Let's rewrite it in a
slightly different way

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.180
so that we get the
feeling of what

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:24.120
it has to do with Hamiltonians.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.720
So this is a coupling term.

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:39.060
So we try to understand, what is
that coupling psi k, psi n dot?

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:40.720
How could we write it?

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:47.200
So what is psi k.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.705
Psi n dot?

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:04.379
To figure this out, we
have no option, probably,

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.330
except looking at the
Schrodinger equation--

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.040
not really the
Schrodinger equation--

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:17.830
the time-instantaneous
state conditions--

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:23.030
En of t, psi n of t.

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.810
So you look at this
instantaneous state condition

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.390
for n and say, OK, I'm
going to differentiate,

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.080
and then I'm going
to make the overlap.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.110
What else could you do?

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.860
This is the equation
that tells you

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.220
how the instantaneous
energy eigenstate is

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.940
supposed to change in time.

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.920
So it must have the information
of how to compute this,

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.100
or how to rewrite it in
terms of other things

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.090
that are interesting.

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.900
So let's differentiate
with respect to time.

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:03.550
Differentiate-- respect to time.

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:06.280
And we use dots, as well.

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:19.750
So let's write this as H dot
times psi n plus H psi n dot

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:30.895
is equal to En dot, psi
n plus En, psi n dot.

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.460
And then we do what--

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.330
we want psi k here
from the left.

00:02:43.330 --> 00:03:01.430
So we'll have a psi
k, H dot, psi n plus--

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.390
Now you're going to
put the psi k here.

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:08.450
The H will act on the left.

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:19.410
So we will have an
Ek psi k, psi n dot.

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.280
That's all that is
left from this term.

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:27.600
The psi k came from the
left and was acted by the H

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.640
to give you an Ek times this.

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:42.720
On this state, I have the psi
k already hitting the psi n.

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.920
Now, we are interested
in this term

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.110
when k is different from n.

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:59.900
These are the couplings to
other states in the analysis

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.420
of the adiabatic approximation.

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:05.930
So let's take k
different from n.

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:10.490
In which case, this
term will give 0.

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:14.630
Because k is different from
n and the state just hits it.

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:21.622
And here we have, finally,
En times psi k, psi n dot.

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:26.070
So good.

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:33.650
I think we can solve
for this state in terms

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:39.760
of a matrix element of the time
derivative of the Hamiltonian.

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:46.925
So what do we have?

00:04:52.390 --> 00:05:04.280
We have that psi k,
psi n dot is equal to 1

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:20.030
over En minus Ek times psi
k, H dot, psi n, which is--

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:25.910
we can use the
notation H dot kn.

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:32.780
The kn matrix element
of H dot is not

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:39.140
equal to the time derivative
of the kn matrix element of H.

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:42.680
You calculate the H dot.

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:44.720
And you put the kn if you wish.

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:52.460
It really is this thing--
the matrix element of H

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:58.770
dot kn over En minus Ek.

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:03.900
The nice thing of
this representation

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:06.450
is that it now
begins to give you

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:13.080
a feeling of why we care
even about slow changes.

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:16.710
We have, in this coupling term--

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:24.990
this is the coupling term
that will take you away

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:28.200
from an instantaneous
energy eigenstate.

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:32.980
This is the term that can ruin
your adiabatic approximation.

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:36.600
And that term,
now, you understand

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:42.210
that it has to do with the rate
of change of the Hamiltonian,

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:47.910
which, after all, is the
thing that drives the physics.

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:50.070
You could say that
term must be small,

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:54.780
because the instantaneous
energy eigenstates must be slow.

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:56.610
And that's true.

00:06:56.610 --> 00:07:03.120
But this equation
makes it clear that you

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:09.540
have here a matrix element or
some information about the time

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:11.430
rate of change of
your Hamiltonian.

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:15.480
And if that is slow,
then this term is small.

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:19.320
And presumably, a small term
in a differential equation

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:21.600
has little effect.

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:29.220
So probably, it's a good
idea to just represent

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:31.700
a particular case
of a Hamiltonian

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:35.020
to just complete
this discussion.

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:38.930
So imagine you have
a Hamiltonian that--

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:42.320
it's of this kind, varies a bit.

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:46.190
Maybe it doesn't vary for
time equal less than 0.

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:51.930
It varies for a while,
and then it stops varying.

00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:57.920
And let's call the time capital
T-- the time for the variation.

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:03.665
This is the typical
thing that people do

00:08:03.665 --> 00:08:05.600
in the adiabatic approximation.

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:10.100
So that is the
language of things--

00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:17.010
nothing, variation during a
time T, nothing after all.

00:08:17.010 --> 00:08:21.230
So what is the goal,
the result here?

00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:23.780
What is the real
statement at the end

00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:27.950
of the day is that
the errors that

00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:30.500
appear in the
adiabatic approximation

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:35.490
are all proportional
to 1 over t.

00:08:35.490 --> 00:08:38.400
So that is a
mathematical statement.

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:43.299
The 1 over this capital T
controls all the errors.

00:08:43.299 --> 00:08:46.230
So if the change
happens very slowly,

00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:51.180
the errors go to
0, like 1 over t.

00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:53.430
And we can see the
beginning of that,

00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:58.100
because I could make a
model of this Hamiltonian

00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:00.020
that is a little different.

00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:05.230
It just may be a line
growing here, for example.

00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:09.180
So this is a
Hamiltonian H of t that

00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:18.040
begins as H0 plus t
over capital T times V.

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:23.950
That is for t between
0 and capital T,

00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:35.580
and then H0 plus V for t
greater than that capital T.

00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:37.920
So here is H0.

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:44.280
Here's H0 plus V.

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:49.680
So if you have this
thing here, you

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:58.290
will have that H dot
is equal to V over T--

00:09:58.290 --> 00:10:01.350
capital T. And that's intuitive.

00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:05.550
The more time you take to
make this finite transition,

00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:09.780
the smaller the value
of the derivative.

00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:17.970
And therefore, an H
dot matrix element kn

00:10:17.970 --> 00:10:22.830
will be 1 over capital
T, the matrix element

00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:31.140
kn of the operator V.

00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:41.460
This term, this overlap, will
be proportional to 1 over T.

00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:45.390
And this error term in
the differential equation

00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:51.700
will be proportional
to 1 over capital T.

00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:57.790
That takes still some effort
to show that when you integrate

00:10:57.790 --> 00:11:02.710
the differential equation, the
error remains 1 over capital T.

00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:04.660
It doesn't get increased.

00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:09.160
But that is precisely
the statement

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:11.560
of the adiabatic theorem.

00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:14.945
The adiabatic
theorem says that--

00:11:14.945 --> 00:11:23.000
and I'll quote it,
maybe, this way.

00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:44.590
If you have the norm
of a wave function,

00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:50.710
you can define the square root
of the overlap of the wave

00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:52.670
function.

00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:56.620
And the way people
precisely state

00:11:56.620 --> 00:12:01.350
the adiabatic theorem is that.

00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:17.580
The state psi, during a time
t minus the psi adiabatic--

00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:22.320
the [? n sets ?] for the
adiabatic state of time t.

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:23.870
The true-- the different--

00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:24.430
I'm sorry.

00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:27.580
The difference
between the true state

00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:31.780
psi of t and the
adiabatic approximation t,

00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:41.020
for t between 0
and T, is less than

00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:49.690
or equal than a
number of times T.

00:12:49.690 --> 00:12:55.090
So the adiabatic approximation
that we've written,

00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:57.850
the state with all
these phases, is

00:12:57.850 --> 00:13:02.890
as close to the real
Schrodinger equation solution--

00:13:02.890 --> 00:13:07.250
the error is less
than 1 over T, where

00:13:07.250 --> 00:13:15.140
T is this time in which you have
nothing here, nothing there.

00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:20.000
And this, in fact, gets even
better for larger times.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.050
So after larger times, the
error doesn't increase.

00:13:24.050 --> 00:13:25.670
So you can keep--

00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:30.950
the change has already
happened, and it doesn't matter.

00:13:30.950 --> 00:13:36.920
So basically, we've
argued intuitively

00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:38.930
what the adiabatic
approximation should

00:13:38.930 --> 00:13:42.830
be by tracking an
instantaneous eigenstate.

00:13:42.830 --> 00:13:48.570
We've now done it with explicit
differential equations.

00:13:48.570 --> 00:13:52.460
If you have an explicit
problem, you can, after all,

00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:56.660
solve this and see
what things happen,

00:13:56.660 --> 00:14:01.970
and therefore, reach the
conclusion that then there are

00:14:01.970 --> 00:14:05.310
a good number of conditions.

00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:07.800
Many situations,
they're slowly varying.

00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:10.980
The adiabatic [? n sets ?]
will give a good solution

00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:14.290
to the Schrodinger equation.

00:14:14.290 --> 00:14:17.740
So that completes our
first part of the analysis.

00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:22.400
Now we're going to turn into
a little different story.

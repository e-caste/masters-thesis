CATHERINE DRENNAN:
So at MIT, there

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.850
are several options
of chemistry courses.

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:18.410
Everyone has to place out of
chemistry or take one semester,

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:20.620
and even if you're going
to be an economics major,

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:23.310
you need that
semester of chemistry,

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:24.690
and there are several options.

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:27.540
And this particular
course is designed

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:30.550
that if you don't have a very
strong background in chemistry

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.400
or maybe if you do but maybe
it's not your favorite subject,

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.640
that this is one you can come
in and take even if you haven't

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.930
taken chemistry before.

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.990
And the backgrounds are
actually quite diverse.

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:48.410
There are absolutely students
who have never taken it before.

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.160
There are other students
who have taken two years who

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.086
probably could have taken
a more advanced class,

00:00:54.086 --> 00:00:55.460
but they thought
this one sounded

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:56.950
like it would be more fun.

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:00.010
So there's quite a bit of
mixture in terms of background.

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.190
A lot of people
coming in are not

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.459
that excited about
chemistry, and this

00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:06.990
was one of my tremendous
surprises when I taught here.

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.130
I realized in high school not
everybody is jumping at the bit

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.530
to take the chemistry
class, but at MIT, these

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:15.790
are scientists and engineers.

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:17.570
Everyone walking
through the door

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.230
should be in love
with chemistry,

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:22.500
and I discovered that
absolutely was not the case

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.040
and that it was my job
to help convince them,

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.400
these people who were
generally interested in science

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.190
and engineering, that
chemistry was important.

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.360
And I just thought
it was obvious,

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.780
but then I had to remember
back to my experience,

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.600
and it wasn't obvious to
me the value of chemistry

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.100
the first time I stepped
in a chemistry course.

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.060
So on the first day
of class, I like

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.810
to show a picture from
my college yearbook,

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.510
a picture of myself and
college yearbook picture of one

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:54.130
of my classmates who
is Lisa Kudrow, who

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.030
is Phoebe on Friends, and I
put both of our pictures up.

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.160
We were in the same class, and I
asked them to guess who we are.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.430
They usually get it.

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.870
And then I ask
them to guess what

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:07.820
I went to college to study.

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:08.810
They guessed chemistry.

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:10.090
I tell them drama.

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:15.100
I ask them to guess about Lisa
Kudrow, and they guessed drama,

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.280
but it was actually
biology, and she

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.370
was a biology major at Vassar.

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.400
And so then I said,
how did this happen?

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.760
How did I become a chemist
and she become an actress?

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.370
And I let them know
this because I said,

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.050
you may have come to
MIT to study something,

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.150
but that might not be
what you end up studying.

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.630
You might be taking this
class because it's required,

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.340
but that's just
because you have not

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.850
found your passion for chemistry
yet, and you will find it.

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:46.040
Maybe you'll find
it this semester.

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.650
Maybe it will be
next year at MIT.

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.821
Maybe it won't be for
years until you're

00:02:51.821 --> 00:02:54.320
an engineer and all of a sudden
you're working with chemists

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.900
and you're like,
oh, man, I really

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.160
need to understand chemistry to
do my engineering job better,

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.790
and then that's when
you fully appreciate

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.230
the value of chemistry.

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.110
But I hope that if you haven't
found your passion yet,

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.970
you will find it this
semester, and I'm

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:14.190
going to try to help you
understand why chemistry

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.600
is so amazing and
how it can affect

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.700
all sorts of
different disciplines.

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.240
And so if you really
embrace it and look at it,

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.940
you realize there's just
wealth of information

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.080
that is in there.

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.644
And if you get these
main tools that we're

00:03:28.644 --> 00:03:30.560
going to cover-- I'm
going to teach you really

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.060
all the basics that you need
to know-- if you can get those,

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.010
you can go on and do all sorts
of things with that chemistry.

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.230
And I have a
7-year-old daughter,

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:42.060
and the world is a pretty
scary place right now.

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.610
There are a lot of problems
associated with it,

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:47.670
and we need people who
understand chemistry

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.010
to make the world better
and to make the world better

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:50.790
for my daughter.

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:57.290
So this is a very
personal exercise for me.

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:00.140
I want everyone to come out of
the class with this background

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.890
in chemistry that they
can save the world,

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:05.760
because the world needs saving
and my daughter is really cute,

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.190
and I'd like to show a picture
of her and say, make this world

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:11.460
a better place for her.

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:07.060
Suppose we have an
object and we're

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:11.680
applying a constant force
in the horizontal direction.

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:15.640
We would now like to
introduce the concept of work.

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:20.410
Suppose our force
starts at a point xi,

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:23.500
and goes to a position
x final, and we'll

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.020
call this the i hat direction.

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:31.270
Then our force as a vector,
we'll write Fx i hat.

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:33.310
And now what we'd
like to calculate

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:37.810
is the product of force with
the displacement of the object.

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:41.170
So our displacement
vector, delta x,

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:47.530
is equal to delta x i hat,
where delta x is equal to x

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.470
final minus x initial.

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:54.070
And for our constant
force for the case

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.970
where Fx is a
constant, we would like

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:01.090
to define the work
done by this force

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:04.599
in displacing the object
from our initial position,

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:06.850
and we'll mark it like that.

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:12.850
To the final position here
is given by the product,

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:18.370
so we'll call work is
the product of the force

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:21.430
Fx times the displacement.

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:27.789
And so that's equal to Fx
times x final minus x initial.

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:31.539
And this is our definition for
work for the special case where

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:34.720
the force is constant.

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:40.120
Now, if we look at this, our
force may-- in our diagram,

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.550
we drew it in the
positive x direction.

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:47.800
But if our force Fx
were less than 0,

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.860
and our displacement was
in the positive direction,

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.850
positive, then you can see
that the work is negative.

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.410
So if the force is
opposing the displacement,

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:01.150
and that's what
would happen if Fx

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.130
was pointing in the
negative direction,

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.290
the work would be negative.

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:10.610
If Fx is positive and the
displacement is positive,

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.700
then the work is positive.

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.590
So we see work is a
scalar that has assigned

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.810
quantity, positive or negative.

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:21.730
Now, whenever we
introduce a new quantity,

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.400
we always have to be a little
bit careful about the units.

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.579
Since work is the product
of force and distance,

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:33.970
then our SI units for
work are the units

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.870
of force, which are newtons,
times the units of distance,

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:38.800
meters.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.250
And we call this a joule.

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.450
So one joule is equal
to one newton meter.

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.100
Now graphically, we can make
an interpretation of this.

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:55.630
Let's draw a graph of force,
the x component of the force.

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:00.100
And here if we had some
origin, we'll have x.

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:05.320
And our object is starting at
xi and it's going to x final.

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.210
And throughout
this process, we're

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:12.290
assuming that the
force is constant.

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.470
So what we see in
this diagram here,

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:19.420
I'll just shade in this
area, that our work, which

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.440
was the product of force
times the displacement,

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:28.520
corresponds to the area here.

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:32.050
So we have a geometric
interpretation of work

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:36.520
as the area under the force
versus position graph.

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:40.510
And this is our example of
work for a constant force.

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:27.960
DENNIS FREEMAN: So today's topic
is to talk about Z-transforms.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.910
But before I start,
I want to mention

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.990
that we've already covered
a great deal of material.

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:39.030
Here, I've made a map just
of things we've done in DT,

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.390
and there's a fair
number of entries.

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.510
More importantly, there's a
fair number of connections

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.610
between those entries.

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.010
And if you're thinking
about systems,

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.900
you should be able
to think about,

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.950
what do each one of
those arrows stand for?

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:58.290
The reason that's
important is that we

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:01.480
like to have multiple
representations for the system

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.480
so that we're always able
to choose the one that

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.800
lets us work the most simply.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.410
But sometimes that involves
moving between the squares.

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:12.240
So the way the problem
was posed to you

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.220
may not be the simplest
way to solve it,

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.070
and that involves, then, going
across one of those arrows.

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.160
So for example, we
know that there's

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.800
a simple relationship between
block diagrams and system

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.510
functionals.

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:26.560
All you need to do
is think about delays

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.910
as being the right
shift operator.

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:33.150
That's a way of thinking about
the system functional is just

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:40.600
a formula picture of
the block diagram.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.270
Similarly, we can think about
moving between the block

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:44.980
diagram and the
difference equation

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.875
by thinking about delay
being a shift of the index.

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.120
So you should be able to think
of ways of thinking about all

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.630
of the transformations
between the boxes.

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.900
Over here, we thought
about system functionals.

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:03.190
How do you think about a system
as a sequence of operations

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:05.920
that you do to a signal?

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.720
We also thought about
system functions,

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.300
and there's a very simple
relationship between those.

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.860
You think about the operator
expression that involves

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.070
Rs and replace each R with 1/z.

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.140
OK, that was all a big
set up, because now I

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.300
want to ask a question.

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.990
Using your vast knowledge of how
all these things interrelate,

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:32.290
what's the relationship
between the system functional,

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:37.180
a function of R, and the
unit sample response?

00:02:41.897 --> 00:02:44.480
As usual, I'd like you to talk
to your neighbor to figure this

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.960
out, and as usual, you won't
do that unless I tell you

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.300
to do something trivial first.

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.025
So look toward your
neighbor, say, "Hi."

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.300
Wonderful, good.

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:57.900
Now, figure out this problem.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:45.432
OK, how many of you--

00:04:45.432 --> 00:04:46.390
I want a show of hands.

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:49.384
How many of you know a way of
getting between those boxes?

00:04:49.384 --> 00:04:50.050
Raise your hand.

00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:54.760
How many of you are
sitting beside somebody

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.635
who knows the way to
get between those boxes?

00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.770
No.

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:01.450
OK, that didn't work either.

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:04.190
OK, can somebody tell me, if I
told you a system functional,

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:07.810
say I told you that one,
how would I figure out

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:10.230
the unit sample response
from the system function--

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:11.880
functional?

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:12.611
Yes.

00:05:12.611 --> 00:05:14.770
AUDIENCE: Don't you take
the inverse Laplace of it?

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:16.630
DENNIS FREEMAN: Inverse Laplace.

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:19.600
OK, that's kind of
right, but not quite.

00:05:22.366 --> 00:05:26.110
So usually, the
answer to the question

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:28.570
is either the slide before
this one or the slide

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:30.290
after this one.

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:31.955
So that doesn't quite fit this.

00:05:31.955 --> 00:05:34.771
The slide before this one said
something about Z-transforms.

00:05:39.946 --> 00:05:41.320
Can somebody think
of a way, if I

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:43.690
told you the system
functional is this thing,

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:49.190
how would you derive the
unit sample response?

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:49.928
Yes.

00:05:49.928 --> 00:05:51.920
AUDIENCE: You could convert
it into a difference equation

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:53.420
and then just work
it out manually.

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:54.920
DENNIS FREEMAN: Convert it
into a difference equation.

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:55.590
That would work.

00:05:55.590 --> 00:06:01.012
So what you could do is go
from this box to that box.

00:06:01.012 --> 00:06:02.470
Then, if you had
this box how would

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:03.844
you get the unit
sample response?

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:10.056
Yes.

00:06:10.056 --> 00:06:13.350
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] delta.

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:15.350
DENNIS FREEMAN: Put a
delta into the difference.

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:17.690
Think about the difference
equation being a system.

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:19.970
Put a delta in and
see what comes out.

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:21.316
Exactly.

00:06:21.316 --> 00:06:22.940
Can somebody think
of a more direct way

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:25.250
that doesn't skirt through
the difference equation?

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:25.990
Yes.

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:29.070
AUDIENCE: Multiply the system
functional by a delta function.

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:31.650
DENNIS FREEMAN: Multiply the
functional by a delta function.

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:33.240
I'm not quite sure
what that means,

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:35.250
but I'm willing to try anything.

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:38.250
1 over 1 minus R
minus R squared.

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:40.050
Multiply that times
a delta function.

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:44.800
What do I do next?

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:51.900
OK, as I said, the
answer to the question

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:53.580
is usually something
that we just did

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:55.584
or something we're
just about to do.

00:06:55.584 --> 00:06:57.500
Where did we spend the
last three weeks doing?

00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:58.630
No, it's not three weeks.

00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:02.990
It's only a week, but,
you know, I exaggerate.

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:05.010
What have we been doing?

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:06.274
Yes.

00:07:06.274 --> 00:07:08.990
AUDIENCE: We could use
long division [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:11.127
DENNIS FREEMAN: One way
would be use long division.

00:07:11.127 --> 00:07:11.960
How would that work?

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:12.840
If we did 1/1--

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:18.650
maybe I'd better use a
bigger blackboard space--

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:24.309
if I tried to do 1 over 1 minus
R minus R squared, if I tried

00:07:24.309 --> 00:07:25.850
to think about that
by long division,

00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:30.110
I would do 1 minus R
minus R squared into 1.

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:33.070
How would that work?

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:33.800
Well, I'd go 1--

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:36.290
I'd go 1 goes into 1 once.

00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:38.690
I get 1 minus R minus R squared.

00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:41.660
This minus this gives
me R plus R squared.

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:48.690
This goes into this plus
R. That gives me whatever.

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:52.790
Having done it in the
solitude of my own breakfast

00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:57.130
this morning, here's an
answer that I got there.

00:07:57.130 --> 00:08:00.050
So if I perform long
division on the functional,

00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:03.410
I get this kind of an answer.

00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:05.000
The question was,
how do I relate

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.400
the functional to the
unit sample response?

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:10.869
How do I-- how do I relate this
to the unit sample response?

00:08:10.869 --> 00:08:12.410
AUDIENCE: The
coefficient [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:12.710
DENNIS FREEMAN: Excuse me?

00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:14.720
AUDIENCE: The
coefficients [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:17.130
DENNIS FREEMAN: The
coefficients of this expression

00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:19.745
are the unit sample response.

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:23.440
OK?

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:25.210
So there's a very
straightforward way.

00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:27.610
If I tell you the
system functional,

00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:29.360
if I tell you this
representation,

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:32.679
there's a very simple way
that we've thought about

00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:36.500
by which you can
automatically calculate what

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:39.160
is the unit sample response?

00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:40.090
OK?

00:08:40.090 --> 00:08:45.610
In fact, it's so simple that
we can write a formula for it.

00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:49.710
Think about the unit sample
response being h of n.

00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:52.340
Associate the h 0
term with a constant,

00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:56.550
the h 1 term with an R, with
the h 2 term with an R squared.

00:08:56.550 --> 00:09:01.270
Add them all together,
that's the answer.

00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:06.260
So the way you get between these
representations is very simple.

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.950
Here's the unit sample response,
here's the system functional,

00:09:08.950 --> 00:09:11.920
and here's an equation
that relates the two

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:12.910
representations.

00:09:12.910 --> 00:09:15.530
That all completely clear?

00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:16.030
Simple.

00:09:16.030 --> 00:09:18.380
Yes, hi.

00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:20.642
Everything clear?

00:09:20.642 --> 00:09:21.475
Questions, comments?

00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:27.800
OK, a follow-up question.

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:30.990
So here's a relationship between
these two representations.

00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:33.765
How about a relationship between
these two representations?

00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:39.210
Yes.

00:09:39.210 --> 00:09:40.376
AUDIENCE: Same relationship.

00:09:40.376 --> 00:09:42.390
Just use one of
the place markers.

00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:44.020
DENNIS FREEMAN: Precisely.

00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:47.000
So it's really-- so we got
this one in the previous step.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.264
R is just 1/z, so we get this.

00:09:50.264 --> 00:09:52.180
So we get a relationship
that looks like that.

00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:58.600
OK, that relationship is the
basis of today's lecture.

00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:01.280
We call that relationship--

00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:04.680
so that relationship represents
a mathematical relationship

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:12.300
between a function of
z and a function of n,

00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:16.460
and we call that
relationship the Z-transform.

00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:17.710
So that's the topic for today.

00:10:17.710 --> 00:10:22.140
We're going to think about
systems, not as an operator,

00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:26.160
but as a mathematical
function, h of z.

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:29.820
So the first thing to realize
is that this transform then,

00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:32.070
this thing that we're going
to be worried about today

00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:37.810
is a map between a
discrete function

00:10:37.810 --> 00:10:42.180
and a continuous function of z.

00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:43.680
And even though
it's been motivated,

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:45.210
I motivated it by
thinking about how

00:10:45.210 --> 00:10:48.780
it would relate to a
system, that relationship

00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:50.790
between a function of
z and a function of n

00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:55.830
is something that you could do
on any discrete time signal.

00:10:55.830 --> 00:10:58.380
So in fact, if you
have any signal x of n,

00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:00.270
we can think about
the Z-transform of it

00:11:00.270 --> 00:11:03.180
by simply thinking about what
that equation is telling us.

00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:09.040
How does it map from a function
of n to a function of z?

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:10.990
I've written it in a little--

00:11:10.990 --> 00:11:12.890
in a way that you might
not have anticipated.

00:11:12.890 --> 00:11:15.487
You might have thought I
would have started at 0.

00:11:15.487 --> 00:11:17.320
That's just because
we're going to do what's

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:19.690
called the bilateral transform.

00:11:19.690 --> 00:11:22.210
There are many kinds
of Z-transforms.

00:11:22.210 --> 00:11:23.920
We're going to do
this particular one.

00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:25.390
Other classes that
you might take

00:11:25.390 --> 00:11:28.360
may use something
called a unilateral.

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:29.830
If you're not
taking such a class,

00:11:29.830 --> 00:11:31.663
there's no good reason
for you to know that.

00:11:31.663 --> 00:11:34.990
If you are taking such a
class, we're doing bilateral.

00:11:34.990 --> 00:11:36.700
That just means
two-sided, and we'll

00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:41.580
see by the end of the hour how
that makes some things simpler.

00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:44.040
The big picture is
identical whether you

00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:48.750
do unilateral or bilateral,
but there are differences.

00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:49.710
OK.

00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:50.790
Simple Z-transforms.

00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:53.130
What's the Z-transform
of the simplest

00:11:53.130 --> 00:11:54.630
signal that we can imagine?

00:11:54.630 --> 00:11:56.580
Simplest signal
that we can imagine

00:11:56.580 --> 00:11:58.170
is the unit sample signal.

00:11:58.170 --> 00:12:00.390
It's 0 everywhere
except n equals 0.

00:12:00.390 --> 00:12:03.720
At n equals 0, it's the simplest
possible non-zero answer,

00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:04.285
which is 1.

00:12:06.852 --> 00:12:07.810
What's the Z-transform?

00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:09.080
Well, that's trivial.

00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:11.970
You stick it in the formula.

00:12:11.970 --> 00:12:15.520
The only non-zero
answer is at n equals 0.

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:17.870
Stick in n equals 0, and
we get that the answer

00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:20.960
is the Z-transform is 1.

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:22.080
What could be easier?

00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:22.760
Good.

00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:28.860
Simple signal in time, simple
signal in the Z-transform.

00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:33.720
What's the Z-transform for a
delayed unit sample signal?

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:37.050
What happens if the only
place that it's not 0

00:12:37.050 --> 00:12:39.910
is shifted to n equals 1?

00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:41.510
Not a big deal.

00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:43.950
Again, there's a
single non-zero answer,

00:12:43.950 --> 00:12:47.420
it's just that it's
now at n equals 1.

00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:49.870
So this answer is
z to the minus 1.

00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:53.750
We took a signal that
was a function of n,

00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:55.800
and we represent it
by a Z-transform,

00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:58.040
which is a function of z.

00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:00.590
Delta of n is 1.

00:13:00.590 --> 00:13:04.800
Delta of n minus 1
is z to the minus 1.

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:08.460
OK, with that vast
knowledge of Z-transforms,

00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:11.850
figure out the Z-transform for
a slightly more complicated

00:13:11.850 --> 00:13:14.040
sequence of the
type-- of the type

00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:16.920
that we saw when we
were looking at systems.

00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:19.020
What if the signal that
we're interested in

00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:22.080
is 7/8 to the n, u of n,
where I'm using the u of n

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:26.500
just to cut off the negative
parts of 7/8 to the n.

00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:28.350
So find the
Z-transform, and find

00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:30.630
if it looks like one
of those four answers

00:13:30.630 --> 00:13:32.080
or none, which is number five.

00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:17.850
So what answer best represents
the Z-transform of the signal

00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:19.020
x?

00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:21.135
Raise your hand, number
one through five.

00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:28.510
It's a participatory sport.

00:15:28.510 --> 00:15:32.260
Good 97% correct, I think.

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:35.230
So OK.

00:15:35.230 --> 00:15:36.119
Everybody says two.

00:15:36.119 --> 00:15:36.910
How do you get two?

00:15:36.910 --> 00:15:38.000
What do you do?

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.190
Plug in the formula, right?

00:15:39.190 --> 00:15:42.490
It's a very simple-minded thing.

00:15:42.490 --> 00:15:44.590
If you were to think
about this signal

00:15:44.590 --> 00:15:47.710
and think about the
definition of the Z-transform,

00:15:47.710 --> 00:15:51.910
just substitute this particular
signal, 7/8 to the n, u of n,

00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:57.440
in where there would
have been the x of n

00:15:57.440 --> 00:15:59.990
and try to close the sum, right?

00:15:59.990 --> 00:16:02.480
It's a geometric sequence.

00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:05.550
We've had lots of experience
with geometric sequences.

00:16:05.550 --> 00:16:07.250
It was in the
homework, and so we all

00:16:07.250 --> 00:16:10.000
know that the answer to
summing a geometric--

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.400
a one-sided geometric sequence
is something of the form

00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:15.340
1 over 1 minus a.

00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:16.640
OK, easy, right?

00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:22.660
So the idea, then,
is that we understand

00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:25.570
a general rule by which we
can map a function of time

00:16:25.570 --> 00:16:28.420
into a function of z.

00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:33.030
So the function of time has
to make sense everywhere.

00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:36.180
That's-- we want
that to be true.

00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:39.300
We want to know what was
the system's unit sample

00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:42.400
response, for example, or what
was the input to the system,

00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:42.900
or whatever.

00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:46.050
We want to know that at
all possible values of n.

00:16:46.050 --> 00:16:47.310
How about the other case?

00:16:47.310 --> 00:16:49.140
Does it make sense?

00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:53.190
Is x of z makes sense for
all possible values of z?

00:16:55.710 --> 00:16:59.940
And since I ask the
question, the answer is no.

00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:01.120
Yes, of course.

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:02.700
I wouldn't have
asked the question

00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:05.369
if the answer were yes, right?

00:17:05.369 --> 00:17:06.839
So by the theory
of lecturers, you

00:17:06.839 --> 00:17:09.660
can tell the answer
has to have been no.

00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:12.945
So the question is, what
values of z don't make sense?

00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:19.079
Shout.

00:17:19.079 --> 00:17:21.800
AUDIENCE: The summation
of the [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:24.109
DENNIS FREEMAN: The
summation has to converge,

00:17:24.109 --> 00:17:29.540
so it's only going to be defined
if this sum, which happens

00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:34.230
to be an infinite sum and
therefore may not converge,

00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:36.620
it's going to have to be the
case that that infinite sum

00:17:36.620 --> 00:17:37.370
does converge.

00:17:37.370 --> 00:17:39.740
Otherwise, it won't make
sense to talk about it.

00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:41.930
So then the question
is, for what values of z

00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:43.910
will that converge?

00:17:43.910 --> 00:17:45.530
And again, we know
from our experience

00:17:45.530 --> 00:17:53.900
with geometric sequences that
the base of the geometric, a,

00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:56.720
when we did homework one,
the base of the geometric

00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:58.230
has to have what?

00:17:58.230 --> 00:17:59.972
What's the property
of the base of the--

00:17:59.972 --> 00:18:01.430
the geometric
that'll make it work?

00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:08.690
So if I want to sum some
series of the form n equals 0

00:18:08.690 --> 00:18:12.800
to infinity a to the
n, what's the values--

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:16.425
what's the limitation
on a that makes it work?

00:18:16.425 --> 00:18:21.274
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:21.274 --> 00:18:22.940
DENNIS FREEMAN: OK,
you're not saying it

00:18:22.940 --> 00:18:26.432
loud enough or clearly enough,
or I'm too dense or something.

00:18:26.432 --> 00:18:27.747
AUDIENCE: Abs less than 1?

00:18:27.747 --> 00:18:29.330
DENNIS FREEMAN: So
we need something--

00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:30.770
we need abs less than 1, right.

00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:34.950
So we do the same thing here.

00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:43.180
We're going to have to have
that the geometric base, 7/8 1

00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:47.660
over z has to be less-- has
to have a magnitude that

00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:49.950
is less than 1.

00:18:49.950 --> 00:18:53.150
And if we torture our minds
with inequalities and magnitude

00:18:53.150 --> 00:18:55.760
signs, that says that
the magnitude of z

00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:58.700
has to be bigger than 7/8.

00:18:58.700 --> 00:18:59.950
OK?

00:18:59.950 --> 00:19:04.110
The important idea is
that when we characterize

00:19:04.110 --> 00:19:08.380
the Z-transform, we
should be expecting

00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:10.840
it to work for all values
of n, but not necessarily

00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:13.030
all values of z.

00:19:13.030 --> 00:19:14.690
So we have to be
cognizant of that.

00:19:14.690 --> 00:19:18.640
We have to know which values
of z are you talking about.

00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:20.720
We call that idea the
region of convergence.

00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:24.430
We say the Z-transform converged
for all z inside the region

00:19:24.430 --> 00:19:25.790
of convergence.

00:19:25.790 --> 00:19:28.480
So when you specify
a Z-transform,

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:32.650
generally, you have to tell me
not just some functional form,

00:19:32.650 --> 00:19:34.270
but you also have
to tell me what

00:19:34.270 --> 00:19:38.780
was the region for which that
functional form converged.

00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:41.956
So in general, you have to tell
me the region of convergence.

00:19:41.956 --> 00:19:43.330
In this particular
case, you have

00:19:43.330 --> 00:19:45.280
to tell me that
you should restrict

00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:48.730
your attention to values
of z whose magnitude is

00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:51.250
bigger than 7/8.

00:19:51.250 --> 00:19:53.380
OK?

00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:56.470
OK, that's completely the whole
definition of Z-transforms.

00:19:56.470 --> 00:20:00.090
We're done from a point of
view of mathematics, right?

00:20:00.090 --> 00:20:06.030
So all we need to know is that
the Z-transform of a signal

00:20:06.030 --> 00:20:14.280
is some sum of the signal z to
the minus n, and we're done.

00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:16.590
We need to know about the
region of convergence,

00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:18.630
but mathematically, we've
completely specified

00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:20.160
the problem at this point.

00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:22.410
To make it useful,
however, what we need to do

00:20:22.410 --> 00:20:25.740
is investigate properties
of that transformation.

00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:28.350
If the transformation were
not easy to manipulate,

00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:31.090
we wouldn't bother with it.

00:20:31.090 --> 00:20:35.810
So we want to know what's easy
to do with the Z-transform

00:20:35.810 --> 00:20:38.210
and what's not easy to
do with the Z-transform.

00:20:38.210 --> 00:20:40.940
When something's easy to do with
the Z-transform, we'll use it.

00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:42.920
When things are easier
to do some other way,

00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:44.420
we use the other way.

00:20:44.420 --> 00:20:45.980
That's the game plan.

00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:48.650
So there's a number of
properties of the Z-transform

00:20:48.650 --> 00:20:51.210
that make it easy or
hard to do things.

00:20:51.210 --> 00:20:53.420
So we'll talk about
the easy ones.

00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:58.610
The most fundamental
one is linearity.

00:20:58.610 --> 00:21:03.590
Basically, this entire subject
is about linear things.

00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:06.590
If it's not linear, largely,
we don't talk about it.

00:21:06.590 --> 00:21:08.840
The reason is we have such
powerful tools for thinking

00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:10.980
about things that are linear.

00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:13.090
This is one of them.

00:21:13.090 --> 00:21:16.100
If-- so we say that
the Z-transform is

00:21:16.100 --> 00:21:17.990
a linear operator,
and all that means

00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:23.120
is if you apply the Z-transform
to the sum of two things,

00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:24.932
you get the sum
of the things out.

00:21:24.932 --> 00:21:26.640
It's a little more
complicated than that.

00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:28.264
If I were being a
little more careful--

00:21:28.264 --> 00:21:32.289
in fact, I didn't quite say
a complete definition here.

00:21:32.289 --> 00:21:34.580
This is certainly true, but
there are additional things

00:21:34.580 --> 00:21:35.870
that are also true.

00:21:35.870 --> 00:21:37.550
We say that the
Z-transform is linear

00:21:37.550 --> 00:21:42.770
because if we knew the
z-transform for X 1,

00:21:42.770 --> 00:21:46.760
that includes a functional form
and a region of convergence,

00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:49.380
and if we knew the
Z-transform for X 2,

00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:52.580
again, a functional form
and a region of convergence,

00:21:52.580 --> 00:21:54.710
then by the linearity
of the operator,

00:21:54.710 --> 00:21:58.520
we can figure out just from
the two Z-transforms, what

00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:02.300
is the Z-transform of the sum.

00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:04.860
And that's trivial to see.

00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:07.340
It's easy to see why it
ought to be that way.

00:22:07.340 --> 00:22:09.680
Just look at--
let's think about y,

00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:12.890
which is the signal,
which is the sum.

00:22:12.890 --> 00:22:14.930
By the definition
of Z-transform,

00:22:14.930 --> 00:22:18.010
the Z-transform of the
sum is that formula.

00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:25.550
Y, by definition, is that thing.

00:22:25.550 --> 00:22:31.460
Z commutes-- distributes
over addition,

00:22:31.460 --> 00:22:35.080
and the sum separates.

00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:38.050
So we can always
reduce this to this,

00:22:38.050 --> 00:22:44.475
at least when the case that z is
in both regions of convergence.

00:22:44.475 --> 00:22:45.850
Though later in
the course, we'll

00:22:45.850 --> 00:22:47.830
see that that's a little
overly restrictive.

00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:52.791
Sometimes it works for more
zs than in the intersection.

00:22:52.791 --> 00:22:54.790
But it's guaranteed to
work in the intersection,

00:22:54.790 --> 00:23:00.880
because I know that I can do
this sum if z is in ROC 1.

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:04.090
I know I can do this
sum if z is in ROC 2.

00:23:04.090 --> 00:23:06.640
So I know I can do both of them
if it's in the intersection.

00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:08.290
We'll see a little
later that sometimes you

00:23:08.290 --> 00:23:10.340
can do it even when it's
not in the intersection.

00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:12.214
But for the time being,
we know you can do it

00:23:12.214 --> 00:23:14.980
if it's in the intersection.

00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:21.610
So because of linearity, we know
that the Z-transform of a sum

00:23:21.610 --> 00:23:23.680
is the sum of the Z-transforms.

00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:26.190
I didn't realize when
I made this slide,

00:23:26.190 --> 00:23:28.240
linearity implies
more than that.

00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:29.640
I could have done
a weighted sum.

00:23:33.110 --> 00:23:38.570
I could have said if X 1 goes
to X1 and X 2 goes to X 2,

00:23:38.570 --> 00:23:42.650
then alpha 1, X 1
plus alpha 2, X 2

00:23:42.650 --> 00:23:46.190
goes to alpha 1, X
1 plus alpha 2, X 2.

00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:47.690
I should have put
that in the slide,

00:23:47.690 --> 00:23:50.660
and it just didn't occur to me.

00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:53.480
So the idea of linearity
is slightly more powerful

00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:56.300
than the example
that I gave here.

00:23:56.300 --> 00:23:58.760
But again, linearity is the
most fundamental property

00:23:58.760 --> 00:23:59.774
of Z-transforms.

00:23:59.774 --> 00:24:01.190
If the Z-transform
weren't linear,

00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:02.910
we wouldn't bother with it.

00:24:02.910 --> 00:24:06.080
But it is, so we do.

00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:08.870
Another important property
is the delay property.

00:24:12.930 --> 00:24:15.030
Think about what we do
with discrete signals.

00:24:15.030 --> 00:24:18.660
We put them through
discrete systems.

00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:21.000
Discrete systems of the
type we've looked at so far

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:24.570
have adders, delays, gains.

00:24:24.570 --> 00:24:25.730
Delays.

00:24:25.730 --> 00:24:28.050
If the Z-transform
couldn't handle delays,

00:24:28.050 --> 00:24:30.690
again, we wouldn't do it, right?

00:24:30.690 --> 00:24:32.370
Delays are so
fundamental to the way

00:24:32.370 --> 00:24:34.590
we think about discrete
systems that it

00:24:34.590 --> 00:24:36.660
must be the case that
Z-transforms deal

00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:39.310
with delays well, and they do.

00:24:39.310 --> 00:24:40.900
We've already seen two examples.

00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:45.340
The first example I did
was the unit sample signal

00:24:45.340 --> 00:24:49.620
has a transform of 1, and the
delayed unit sample's signal

00:24:49.620 --> 00:24:52.044
has transform of
z to the minus 1.

00:24:52.044 --> 00:24:53.460
So there's a simple
relationship--

00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:57.060
if I knew the first, how
I could find the second.

00:24:57.060 --> 00:25:02.830
More generally, if I had
a signal X and I knew its

00:25:02.830 --> 00:25:09.710
transform X, then I could
readily compute the transform

00:25:09.710 --> 00:25:13.500
of the shifted version just from
the transform of the unshifted

00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:15.900
version, and that's-- you
can see how that would work

00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:16.950
mathematically.

00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:20.402
Let's call the
shifted version Y,

00:25:20.402 --> 00:25:22.110
then the transform of
the shifted version

00:25:22.110 --> 00:25:25.390
is given by this expression.

00:25:25.390 --> 00:25:27.670
By the definition
of shift, y of n

00:25:27.670 --> 00:25:30.862
is the same as x of n minus 1.

00:25:30.862 --> 00:25:35.350
And now all we need to
do is massage the math

00:25:35.350 --> 00:25:39.550
so it ends up looking like the
definition of a Z-transform.

00:25:39.550 --> 00:25:46.060
So the way to do that would be
to substitute m for n minus 1.

00:25:46.060 --> 00:25:48.730
We get something that looks
more like a Z-transform.

00:25:48.730 --> 00:25:50.950
And if we bring this
minus 1 out front,

00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:53.620
it looks exactly like a
Z-transform pre-multiplied by z

00:25:53.620 --> 00:25:56.070
to the minus 1.

00:25:56.070 --> 00:26:00.190
So the delay theorem
just says if I already

00:26:00.190 --> 00:26:02.020
know the Z-transform
of a signal,

00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:04.600
then to find the Z-transform
of the delayed version

00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:07.930
of that signal, simply multiply
the original Z-transform by z

00:26:07.930 --> 00:26:10.640
to the minus 1.

00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:11.140
OK?

00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:15.020
So so far, I've talked
about two properties

00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:18.740
of Z-transforms, linearity
and the delay property.

00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:24.530
And in combination, they
let me do a lot of stuff

00:26:24.530 --> 00:26:27.470
with discrete systems.

00:26:27.470 --> 00:26:29.295
So think, for
example, of a system,

00:26:29.295 --> 00:26:30.920
a discrete system
that can be described

00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:33.528
by a linear difference equation
with constant coefficients.

00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:39.290
If you can describe
a system that way,

00:26:39.290 --> 00:26:42.560
then you can write the
relationship between the input

00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:46.511
signal X and the output signal
Y that looks like a difference

00:26:46.511 --> 00:26:47.010
equation.

00:26:50.810 --> 00:26:53.900
Then, if you take into
account that the Z-transform

00:26:53.900 --> 00:27:00.460
is both linear and has a simple
representation for delays,

00:27:00.460 --> 00:27:03.910
I can take the Z-transform
of that difference equation

00:27:03.910 --> 00:27:08.030
and get a new expression.

00:27:08.030 --> 00:27:10.420
So the difference equation
represents an equality

00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:15.730
between two sums of
time domain signals.

00:27:15.730 --> 00:27:18.460
Taking the Z-transform
of that equality

00:27:18.460 --> 00:27:21.670
tells me some
equivalent relationship

00:27:21.670 --> 00:27:24.850
of the Z-transforms.

00:27:24.850 --> 00:27:29.890
So if I-- so I think about the
left-hand side by linearity,

00:27:29.890 --> 00:27:33.520
I can find the
Z-transform of this sum

00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:35.470
by finding the sum
of the Z-transforms.

00:27:38.620 --> 00:27:41.500
And so this one's easy, right?

00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:46.690
The Z-transform of y of n
is, by assumption, y of z.

00:27:46.690 --> 00:27:49.600
By linearity, the part
I didn't show you,

00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:51.310
if I pre-multiply
by b nought, it's

00:27:51.310 --> 00:27:52.450
pre-multiplied by b nought.

00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:58.830
Because it's linear, I can
just add the next term to it.

00:27:58.830 --> 00:28:00.990
The next term looks a lot
like the previous term

00:28:00.990 --> 00:28:03.150
except that it's shifted,
but shift is easy.

00:28:03.150 --> 00:28:06.420
You just put z to
the minus 1 in front.

00:28:06.420 --> 00:28:11.300
So this term just becomes
b one, z to the minus 1.

00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:14.040
This just becomes b
2, z to the minus 2,

00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:17.190
and the whole thing factors.

00:28:17.190 --> 00:28:19.467
Same sort of thing
happens on the X side,

00:28:19.467 --> 00:28:21.300
and you end up with a
very simple statement.

00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:25.750
The Z-transform of a system
that can be represented

00:28:25.750 --> 00:28:29.110
by a difference equation
with constant coefficients is

00:28:29.110 --> 00:28:33.730
the ratio of two polynomials
in z to the minus 1--

00:28:33.730 --> 00:28:36.054
this is a polynomial
in z to the minus 1.

00:28:36.054 --> 00:28:40.210
Or if I multiply top and
bottom by z to the k,

00:28:40.210 --> 00:28:43.742
I can make it look like a
ratio of polynomials in z.

00:28:43.742 --> 00:28:44.242
Yeah.

00:28:44.242 --> 00:28:49.274
AUDIENCE: Why is it y to
the x on the b 0 [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:49.274 --> 00:28:50.690
DENNIS FREEMAN:
Why is it y the x?

00:28:50.690 --> 00:28:53.390
Because of my poor typography.

00:28:53.390 --> 00:28:54.230
Thank you very much.

00:28:54.230 --> 00:28:57.500
That's completely wrong.

00:28:57.500 --> 00:29:00.970
OK, so I'll try to remember
that when I get to my office

00:29:00.970 --> 00:29:02.720
and change it before
I post it on the web.

00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:03.650
Thank you.

00:29:03.650 --> 00:29:07.370
So this is y of z, this
is y of z, this is y of z.

00:29:07.370 --> 00:29:12.020
That is-- and you can see I
used [? e-max, ?] so I copied

00:29:12.020 --> 00:29:17.660
the formula and I got the
single error to turn into two.

00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:20.780
It's always very good when
you can do that, right?

00:29:20.780 --> 00:29:22.160
Something like that.

00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:25.280
OK, so the point
then is that simply

00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:28.540
by knowing that the Z-transform
is linear and has a delay

00:29:28.540 --> 00:29:31.070
property, it results in
a very simple statement

00:29:31.070 --> 00:29:34.030
about the Z-transform for a
system that can be represented

00:29:34.030 --> 00:29:35.280
by such a difference equation.

00:29:38.120 --> 00:29:39.080
OK.

00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:43.040
Now we use a little bit of
knowledge about polynomials.

00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:45.785
We use the idea that
the fundamental theorem

00:29:45.785 --> 00:29:46.640
in algebra--

00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:48.890
anybody have any
idea what that is?

00:29:48.890 --> 00:29:49.889
Nah.

00:29:49.889 --> 00:29:51.430
Fundamental theorem
of algebra, what?

00:29:51.430 --> 00:29:52.700
AUDIENCE: That was
a long time ago.

00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:53.690
DENNIS FREEMAN: Long time ago.

00:29:53.690 --> 00:29:56.010
If it was long for you, think
about when it was for me.

00:29:56.010 --> 00:29:57.290
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:57.290 --> 00:29:59.450
No, you can't think that way.

00:29:59.450 --> 00:30:00.279
Yes?

00:30:00.279 --> 00:30:06.270
AUDIENCE: Are we [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:06.270 --> 00:30:07.460
DENNIS FREEMAN: Wonderful.

00:30:07.460 --> 00:30:08.310
Everybody hear that?

00:30:08.310 --> 00:30:09.393
Because I can't repeat it.

00:30:09.393 --> 00:30:11.750
But everybody hear that?

00:30:11.750 --> 00:30:15.800
An nth order
polynomial has n roots.

00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:17.690
Roughly speaking.

00:30:17.690 --> 00:30:19.040
I'm not a mathematician, right?

00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:20.120
I'm an engineer.

00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:20.930
Right?

00:30:20.930 --> 00:30:24.140
An nth order
polynomial has n roots.

00:30:24.140 --> 00:30:26.780
OK, and then the factor theorem.

00:30:26.780 --> 00:30:31.170
Surprisingly enough, that
says you can factor things.

00:30:31.170 --> 00:30:35.600
So the idea then is that if I
can represent the Z-transform

00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:40.530
as a ratio of polynomials and
z, there's a factored form.

00:30:40.530 --> 00:30:42.810
And that's the basis
of a decomposition

00:30:42.810 --> 00:30:45.150
that we will make
extensive use of.

00:30:45.150 --> 00:30:47.040
You've already
seen, extensively,

00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:48.300
the roots of the denominator.

00:30:48.300 --> 00:30:49.560
They're the poles.

00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:52.110
We will similarly define,
because of this manipulation,

00:30:52.110 --> 00:30:53.420
the roots of the numerator.

00:30:53.420 --> 00:30:55.661
They're the zeros.

00:30:55.661 --> 00:30:56.160
OK?

00:30:59.630 --> 00:31:02.960
So-- and it's pretty easy
to think through, then,

00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:05.120
how there is a relationship--

00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:06.974
it's all about
relationships, right?

00:31:06.974 --> 00:31:08.390
When I introduce
something, I want

00:31:08.390 --> 00:31:10.100
to think about how
the thing I just said

00:31:10.100 --> 00:31:13.130
relates to everything
else I've ever said.

00:31:13.130 --> 00:31:17.570
There's a simple relationship
between poles and regions

00:31:17.570 --> 00:31:19.700
of convergence.

00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:22.010
Turns out the regions
of convergence

00:31:22.010 --> 00:31:23.570
are always going to be circles.

00:31:23.570 --> 00:31:25.670
That has-- circles
in the z plane.

00:31:25.670 --> 00:31:27.830
That has to do with
things like convergence

00:31:27.830 --> 00:31:29.060
of geometric sequences.

00:31:32.490 --> 00:31:37.380
If I build my system out of
adders and delays and gains,

00:31:37.380 --> 00:31:39.570
then I have that
complex set of reasoning

00:31:39.570 --> 00:31:42.590
that gives rise to the idea
that I have polynomials.

00:31:42.590 --> 00:31:45.300
That's going to be-- that's
going to give rise to,

00:31:45.300 --> 00:31:51.180
if you think about
poles, partial fractions,

00:31:51.180 --> 00:31:52.920
each of those is going
to have some kind

00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:54.240
of a characteristic response.

00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:55.823
It's going to be a
geometric sequence.

00:31:55.823 --> 00:31:58.260
Each of those is going to have
a convergence property that

00:31:58.260 --> 00:32:00.370
has something to do with
a circle in the z plane.

00:32:03.170 --> 00:32:07.580
Each of those circles is
going to be bounded by a pole.

00:32:07.580 --> 00:32:10.670
So the upshot of
all that stuff is

00:32:10.670 --> 00:32:12.320
there's a relationship
between poles

00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:14.180
and regions of convergence.

00:32:14.180 --> 00:32:15.560
Regions of
convergence are always

00:32:15.560 --> 00:32:17.510
going to be circles
in the z plane,

00:32:17.510 --> 00:32:20.240
and they're always going
to be bounded by a pole.

00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:22.430
And we've seen an
example of that already.

00:32:22.430 --> 00:32:24.980
If we had a geometric
sequence that

00:32:24.980 --> 00:32:29.800
was defined only to the
right of n equals 0--

00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:34.190
if it is non-zero, only
at n equals 0 or bigger--

00:32:34.190 --> 00:32:39.530
then we get convergence
inside some region defined

00:32:39.530 --> 00:32:45.590
by when the base has an absolute
value that's less than 1.

00:32:45.590 --> 00:32:50.120
That's a circle in the z plane.

00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:56.000
And the pole, which is
alpha, turns into the edge

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:59.100
of that circle of convergence.

00:32:59.100 --> 00:33:01.790
So the regions of convergence
for these kinds of systems

00:33:01.790 --> 00:33:04.970
will always be circles in
the z plane, always bounded

00:33:04.970 --> 00:33:05.500
by a pole.

00:33:09.750 --> 00:33:13.650
OK, enough of my talking.

00:33:13.650 --> 00:33:17.770
What DC-- what DT signal has
the following Z-transform?

00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:27.170
I want to know a DT signal
that has transform of the form

00:33:27.170 --> 00:33:31.310
z over z minus 7/8 with
a region of convergence

00:33:31.310 --> 00:33:37.410
inside absolute value
of z equals 7/8.

00:35:43.450 --> 00:35:48.032
So what's the DT signal
that has that Z-transform?

00:35:48.032 --> 00:35:49.490
AUDIENCE: It would
be Y to the n is

00:35:49.490 --> 00:35:53.055
equal to x to the n plus
7/8y to the n minus 1?

00:35:53.055 --> 00:35:55.180
DENNIS FREEMAN: Sounded
like a difference equation.

00:35:55.180 --> 00:35:55.580
Say it again.

00:35:55.580 --> 00:35:55.975
AUDIENCE: Oh yeah.

00:35:55.975 --> 00:35:57.370
Isn't that what
you're looking for?

00:35:57.370 --> 00:35:57.590
DENNIS FREEMAN: No.

00:35:57.590 --> 00:35:58.800
I wanted the signal.

00:35:58.800 --> 00:35:59.740
AUDIENCE: Oh, OK.

00:35:59.740 --> 00:36:01.150
DENNIS FREEMAN: So I
want to think about--

00:36:01.150 --> 00:36:02.274
this is a little confusing.

00:36:02.274 --> 00:36:04.220
I apologize if I didn't
say this clearly.

00:36:04.220 --> 00:36:05.920
We motivated the
idea of Z-transform

00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:11.740
by looking at systems, but
the result, the Z-transform's

00:36:11.740 --> 00:36:12.700
just a relationship.

00:36:12.700 --> 00:36:15.050
It's a map between a function
of n and a function of z.

00:36:15.050 --> 00:36:17.750
So we can do that
for every signal.

00:36:17.750 --> 00:36:19.570
So if I tell you
the function of z,

00:36:19.570 --> 00:36:21.550
you can figure out
the function of n.

00:36:21.550 --> 00:36:24.250
The question here is
intended-- what I intended was,

00:36:24.250 --> 00:36:27.910
what's the function
of n that corresponds

00:36:27.910 --> 00:36:30.220
to that function of z?

00:36:36.482 --> 00:36:36.982
Yes?

00:36:36.982 --> 00:36:40.150
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:40.150 --> 00:36:41.990
DENNIS FREEMAN: 7/8
to the n, u of n.

00:36:41.990 --> 00:36:45.650
That sounds like
something we did before.

00:36:45.650 --> 00:36:49.166
7/8 to the n, u of n.

00:36:49.166 --> 00:36:51.290
That sounds like something
we did before, actually.

00:36:54.590 --> 00:36:55.422
Yes, no?

00:36:55.422 --> 00:36:57.380
Something we did before
is a good thing, right?

00:36:57.380 --> 00:36:59.005
That's one of the
general rules, right?

00:36:59.005 --> 00:37:01.250
When I ask a question,
look at what we did before.

00:37:01.250 --> 00:37:04.420
That's a good rule.

00:37:04.420 --> 00:37:07.090
Is that the same
Z-transform we did before?

00:37:07.090 --> 00:37:07.590
Yes?

00:37:07.590 --> 00:37:10.360
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:12.310
DENNIS FREEMAN: Yes, yes.

00:37:12.310 --> 00:37:18.966
The region of convergence that
we did before was outside 7/8,

00:37:18.966 --> 00:37:21.340
and the region of convergence
I asked for in this problem

00:37:21.340 --> 00:37:28.150
is inside 7/8 So what's
the effect of switching

00:37:28.150 --> 00:37:29.720
the region of convergence?

00:37:33.380 --> 00:37:36.490
What happens if I switch
the region of convergence?

00:37:40.490 --> 00:37:42.490
AUDIENCE: Does z change?

00:37:42.490 --> 00:37:44.990
Does the value of z change?

00:37:44.990 --> 00:37:48.930
DENNIS FREEMAN: Z. It's hard
to talk about the value of z,

00:37:48.930 --> 00:37:49.630
right?

00:37:49.630 --> 00:37:51.276
Z.

00:37:51.276 --> 00:37:52.687
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:52.687 --> 00:37:53.770
DENNIS FREEMAN: Excuse me.

00:37:53.770 --> 00:37:55.390
So z is defined--

00:37:55.390 --> 00:37:57.940
the Z-transform is
defined this way.

00:37:57.940 --> 00:38:05.270
So I want to say that h of z
is always z over z minus 7/8.

00:38:07.910 --> 00:38:11.410
What happens if I say
the region switched?

00:38:11.410 --> 00:38:13.160
Well, it says something
about convergence.

00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:14.618
What's convergence
have to do with?

00:38:14.618 --> 00:38:20.840
Convergence has to do with,
well, I'm thinking about h

00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:29.030
of z is some sum over n of
h of n, z to the minus n.

00:38:29.030 --> 00:38:34.340
So convergent has to do
with which ones of those ns

00:38:34.340 --> 00:38:39.250
can be in the sum, because
some of these terms, z

00:38:39.250 --> 00:38:43.060
to the minus n, when
I switch the region,

00:38:43.060 --> 00:38:46.900
I consider a
different family of z.

00:38:46.900 --> 00:38:53.780
In the first one, that sum had
to converge outside the circle.

00:38:53.780 --> 00:38:56.590
And in the question of interest
now, it has to converge inside.

00:38:56.590 --> 00:38:59.410
So it's a different
set of zs for which

00:38:59.410 --> 00:39:03.290
the sum has to converge.

00:39:03.290 --> 00:39:04.930
There's a way you
can think about that.

00:39:04.930 --> 00:39:05.910
Think about that sum--

00:39:05.910 --> 00:39:09.389
think about exploding that sum.

00:39:09.389 --> 00:39:11.430
In general, we're going
to go from minus infinity

00:39:11.430 --> 00:39:13.020
to infinity, so explode that.

00:39:13.020 --> 00:39:16.290
So we get a whole
bunch of stuff.

00:39:16.290 --> 00:39:21.780
Then we get up to h
of minus 2, z squared.

00:39:21.780 --> 00:39:25.890
Then we have h of minus 1, z.

00:39:25.890 --> 00:39:30.790
Then we have h of 0, z
to the 0, which is 1.

00:39:30.790 --> 00:39:36.060
Then we have h of
1, z to the minus 1.

00:39:36.060 --> 00:39:40.840
Then we have h of 2, z to
the minus 2, et cetera.

00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:41.340
Right?

00:39:41.340 --> 00:39:44.160
That's what the Z-transform
always looks like.

00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:49.160
Which of those terms
are the most convergent

00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:51.760
when I have a z with
a large magnitude?

00:39:57.030 --> 00:40:00.020
So I'm thinking about
the n equals minus 2,

00:40:00.020 --> 00:40:02.410
n equals minus 1, n equals 0.

00:40:02.410 --> 00:40:05.500
I'm thinking about
all the terms and Ys.

00:40:05.500 --> 00:40:09.730
Which of those terms
is the most convergent

00:40:09.730 --> 00:40:14.800
if z has a large magnitude?

00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:17.275
AUDIENCE: I think it
would be z of negative n.

00:40:17.275 --> 00:40:19.227
Like, any negative.

00:40:19.227 --> 00:40:21.560
DENNIS FREEMAN: So they get
increasingly convergent as I

00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:24.360
go to the right.

00:40:24.360 --> 00:40:27.600
If I have z with
a big magnitude,

00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:30.420
each term is getting
increasingly convergent

00:40:30.420 --> 00:40:33.080
as I go to the right.

00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:39.760
That means that these
numbers h 0, h 1, h 2, h 3,

00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:42.250
they can keep being
some finite number.

00:40:42.250 --> 00:40:44.230
They don't need to be 0.

00:40:44.230 --> 00:40:47.650
And it will increasingly
come closer to 0

00:40:47.650 --> 00:40:50.180
as I keep going to the right.

00:40:50.180 --> 00:40:51.760
The implication of
that is something

00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:53.630
that's very important.

00:40:53.630 --> 00:40:59.485
So the implication of that is
that a right-sided signal--

00:41:03.730 --> 00:41:10.180
signal, not single-- has a--

00:41:10.180 --> 00:41:11.710
maps to an outside region.

00:41:17.130 --> 00:41:22.720
If I want the sum to get
increasingly convergent

00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:26.560
for large values of
z, outside regions--

00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:28.540
outside regions have
to take all the values,

00:41:28.540 --> 00:41:31.180
no matter how big they get.

00:41:31.180 --> 00:41:32.860
OK, I want things
to be on the right.

00:41:32.860 --> 00:41:35.710
I don't want things
to be on the left.

00:41:35.710 --> 00:41:40.650
Things on the left become
decreasingly convergent.

00:41:40.650 --> 00:41:49.270
And a corollary of
that, left-sided signals

00:41:49.270 --> 00:41:54.370
map to inside regions.

00:41:54.370 --> 00:41:58.000
So in fact, it's not a fluke
that this right-handed signal

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:00.370
mapped to this outside region.

00:42:00.370 --> 00:42:02.740
That's where the convergence
for things to the right

00:42:02.740 --> 00:42:05.291
are the best.

00:42:05.291 --> 00:42:05.790
OK.

00:42:05.790 --> 00:42:07.800
Now I've just told you
everything you need to know.

00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:09.258
What's it going
to-- what do I need

00:42:09.258 --> 00:42:13.380
to have happen if I want it to
converge to the inside region?

00:42:16.540 --> 00:42:17.860
Flip the signal.

00:42:17.860 --> 00:42:20.860
More or less, I want
it to go to the left.

00:42:20.860 --> 00:42:23.880
I don't want it to
go to the right.

00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:28.400
So the way I can
think about that

00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:31.850
is by thinking about
the functional form

00:42:31.850 --> 00:42:38.550
is the same for the inside
and the outside region.

00:42:38.550 --> 00:42:41.947
That means they have the
same difference equation,

00:42:41.947 --> 00:42:43.780
because you can find
the difference equation

00:42:43.780 --> 00:42:46.210
from the functional form.

00:42:46.210 --> 00:42:47.970
But the way I want
to think about it

00:42:47.970 --> 00:42:50.800
is propagating the signal
that came in to the right

00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:52.450
or to the left.

00:42:52.450 --> 00:42:55.390
So rather then iterating
forward in time,

00:42:55.390 --> 00:42:58.900
which is what we did before,
one way I can think about it is,

00:42:58.900 --> 00:43:01.690
let's iterate backwards in time.

00:43:01.690 --> 00:43:07.270
Rather than solving for y of
n plus 1 in terms of y of n,

00:43:07.270 --> 00:43:11.050
solve instead for y of n
in terms of y of n plus 1.

00:43:11.050 --> 00:43:13.180
Run it backwards.

00:43:13.180 --> 00:43:15.914
Difference equation
doesn't care.

00:43:15.914 --> 00:43:17.580
If the difference
equation doesn't care,

00:43:17.580 --> 00:43:21.180
the functional form
will be the same.

00:43:21.180 --> 00:43:24.580
So run the difference
equation backwards.

00:43:24.580 --> 00:43:30.290
So if you think about doing
that, rest starts to say,

00:43:30.290 --> 00:43:32.670
the system starts--

00:43:32.670 --> 00:43:37.620
starts means future times,
OK, because we're flipped.

00:43:37.620 --> 00:43:39.000
So the signal starts at 0.

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:39.960
That means it starts--

00:43:39.960 --> 00:43:45.390
that means at large values
of n, the signal y is 0.

00:43:45.390 --> 00:43:46.890
So I fill in this
table with a bunch

00:43:46.890 --> 00:43:51.420
of zeros for big values of n.

00:43:51.420 --> 00:43:53.640
So n's decreasing this way.

00:43:53.640 --> 00:43:55.140
I'm working from toward--

00:43:55.140 --> 00:43:58.340
0 toward the left.

00:43:58.340 --> 00:44:00.290
So I assume that
I start at rest.

00:44:00.290 --> 00:44:03.950
That means the output is
0 for times on the right.

00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:10.300
I want to find the unit sample
response, so x is 1 only at n

00:44:10.300 --> 00:44:13.070
equals 0.

00:44:13.070 --> 00:44:16.780
And now I just
compute each entry

00:44:16.780 --> 00:44:19.610
by sticking it into the
difference equation.

00:44:19.610 --> 00:44:20.970
And so I've done that.

00:44:20.970 --> 00:44:25.060
So you stick these values
into the difference equation,

00:44:25.060 --> 00:44:29.210
and that lets you
compute y of minus 1.

00:44:29.210 --> 00:44:31.300
So substitute y of minus 1.

00:44:31.300 --> 00:44:37.720
Y of minus 1, it depends
on y of 0 and x of 0.

00:44:37.720 --> 00:44:40.840
Similarly for all
the entries, and then

00:44:40.840 --> 00:44:42.910
I can make a plot of
that, and I get a function

00:44:42.910 --> 00:44:43.800
that looks like this.

00:44:47.250 --> 00:44:48.130
It's a geometric.

00:44:48.130 --> 00:44:50.590
I'm not surprised by that.

00:44:50.590 --> 00:44:53.230
The geometric is kind
of facing the wrong way.

00:44:53.230 --> 00:44:54.750
It was 7/8 to the end.

00:44:54.750 --> 00:44:57.130
It looked convergent.

00:44:57.130 --> 00:45:00.210
This one looks
divergent that way,

00:45:00.210 --> 00:45:04.240
but I'm multiplying
these h numbers, which

00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:08.110
are blowing up that
way, by numbers

00:45:08.110 --> 00:45:09.739
that look like z squared.

00:45:09.739 --> 00:45:12.155
So if I make z squared small
enough, it'll still converge.

00:45:15.320 --> 00:45:17.140
That's the idea.

00:45:17.140 --> 00:45:17.770
OK?

00:45:17.770 --> 00:45:20.290
By flipping the
region of convergence,

00:45:20.290 --> 00:45:25.000
I've changed the magnitudes
of these numbers,

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:27.730
and I've changed which
side converges best.

00:45:27.730 --> 00:45:30.600
I've made something that--

00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:31.990
it's an inside region.

00:45:31.990 --> 00:45:36.280
It was converging for z
values inside some region,

00:45:36.280 --> 00:45:38.440
so it's become left-sided.

00:45:38.440 --> 00:45:44.590
So the idea then is that I have
two different kinds of time

00:45:44.590 --> 00:45:48.520
signals that are both associated
with the same functional form

00:45:48.520 --> 00:45:49.270
of z.

00:45:49.270 --> 00:45:51.580
They differ by the
region of convergence.

00:45:51.580 --> 00:45:54.220
That's why when you
tell me a Z-transform,

00:45:54.220 --> 00:45:57.250
you have to tell me the
region of convergence.

00:45:57.250 --> 00:45:57.750
OK?

00:46:00.770 --> 00:46:02.140
OK.

00:46:02.140 --> 00:46:04.480
So I've given some exercises.

00:46:04.480 --> 00:46:06.530
I'm running out of time.

00:46:06.530 --> 00:46:11.494
The best thing to do is to think
about the exercises offline.

00:46:11.494 --> 00:46:12.910
I could lead you
through the math.

00:46:12.910 --> 00:46:16.670
That's never very inspirational.

00:46:16.670 --> 00:46:20.880
So what I wanted to show you
is that there's many ways

00:46:20.880 --> 00:46:26.800
that you can go about
expressing a complicated form

00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:31.990
by partial fractions to get
a simpler form that can then

00:46:31.990 --> 00:46:36.160
be inverted this way.

00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:38.560
So that's the point
of this exercise.

00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:42.070
So I went through in the notes,
and the notes are online.

00:46:42.070 --> 00:46:44.580
So in the notes, I went
through three different ways

00:46:44.580 --> 00:46:48.000
you can think of the answer,
and all of those answers

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:50.760
give you the same
functional form, right?

00:46:50.760 --> 00:46:53.370
So it was an exercise
in thinking through how

00:46:53.370 --> 00:46:55.680
you do partial fractions.

00:46:55.680 --> 00:46:58.320
But there's one more thing
that I want to talk about,

00:46:58.320 --> 00:47:01.860
and that is that a lot of these
problems-- one of the biggest

00:47:01.860 --> 00:47:05.700
uses of Z-transforms is to
solve difference equations.

00:47:08.290 --> 00:47:09.880
Z-transforms are great for that.

00:47:09.880 --> 00:47:11.500
I've already talked about that.

00:47:11.500 --> 00:47:14.170
With-- by using a Z-transform,
you can take a difference

00:47:14.170 --> 00:47:17.680
equation, think about
the difference equation,

00:47:17.680 --> 00:47:20.650
think about the input, take the
Laplace transform of everything

00:47:20.650 --> 00:47:22.260
you get--

00:47:22.260 --> 00:47:25.120
Laplace transform--
a Z-transform, sorry.

00:47:25.120 --> 00:47:25.810
Slipped.

00:47:25.810 --> 00:47:28.370
Next time it will be
Laplace transform.

00:47:28.370 --> 00:47:29.800
Take a Z-transform.

00:47:29.800 --> 00:47:32.500
You end up with a Z-transform,
and then the trick

00:47:32.500 --> 00:47:37.270
is to recognize the
inverse Z-transform.

00:47:37.270 --> 00:47:44.680
There are ways of thinking
about that as a mathematician.

00:47:44.680 --> 00:47:50.430
Those ways are not easy,
so by and large, we

00:47:50.430 --> 00:47:52.410
will never do this.

00:47:52.410 --> 00:47:56.730
If you would like to do that,
I highly recommend course 18.

00:47:56.730 --> 00:47:57.660
OK?

00:47:57.660 --> 00:47:59.940
It is certainly something
that people in course 18

00:47:59.940 --> 00:48:03.210
do all the time, but there
are always simpler ways

00:48:03.210 --> 00:48:06.270
that we will do it,
and those simpler ways

00:48:06.270 --> 00:48:10.440
derive from thinking about
properties of the z-transform.

00:48:10.440 --> 00:48:13.300
And we'll think more about those
as we go forward in the course.

00:48:13.300 --> 00:48:16.350
So the point of today
was to emphasize

00:48:16.350 --> 00:48:19.140
that there are lots of
different ways of thinking

00:48:19.140 --> 00:48:21.540
about DT systems.

00:48:21.540 --> 00:48:24.270
You should be able to think of
all the relations between them.

00:48:24.270 --> 00:48:25.800
And in particular,
today we talked

00:48:25.800 --> 00:48:28.560
about this thing, a
mathematical relationship

00:48:28.560 --> 00:48:31.320
for how you can go from
a unit sample response

00:48:31.320 --> 00:48:32.250
to a system function.

00:48:35.850 --> 00:48:38.000
See you next week.

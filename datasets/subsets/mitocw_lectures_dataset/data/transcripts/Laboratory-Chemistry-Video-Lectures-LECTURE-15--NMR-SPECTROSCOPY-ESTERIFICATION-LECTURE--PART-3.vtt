[SQUEAKING] [RUSTLING]

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:14.942
[CLICKING]

00:00:14.942 --> 00:00:16.400
JOHN GRIMES: OK,
well, I guess I'll

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.640
get started, and let
people trickle in,

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.690
if anybody else is coming in.

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:23.420
So my name is John Grimes.

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:26.480
And I work in the chemistry
department's Instrumentation

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:27.740
Facility.

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:30.080
And down there,
we've got a number

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.700
of different instruments.

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:36.050
We have five mass
spec instruments.

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:37.730
That is not my specialty.

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:39.530
So other than being
able to point them out,

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.790
I can't really tell you
that much about them.

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.630
I help run NMRs.

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:49.850
And so what I do is I teach
students how to use the NMRs.

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.740
I will help them select what
experiments they possibly

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:58.940
need to use in order to give
them the answer that they're

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.200
looking for.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.040
And I'll also help them
interpret the data,

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.670
or at least get them started
off on interpreting the data so

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:09.680
that they can do
that on their own

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.000
when they're doing
their own research.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.570
So what I hope to talk
to you about today

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:20.390
is what an NMR instrument
is and what it actually

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.970
consists of as far
as the parts, what

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:27.560
the analytical
technique of NMR is,

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.950
and how we measure
the signal, and then

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.500
go into some examples of
how to interpret the data.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.900
So here's a picture of one
of our instruments there.

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:44.170
And here's an example
spectrum of adenosine.

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.910
So nuclear magnetic resonance
is what NMR stands for.

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:52.870
And it's the study of
molecular structure

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:57.700
by measuring the interaction
of radio frequency energy

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.310
with a collection of
nuclei that you've taken

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.340
and you've put into a
strong magnetic field.

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:09.580
So it's an analytical technique
that is based on a nucleus's--

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:16.270
or nuclei-- intrinsic
angular momentum.

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:19.750
It is a nondestructive
analytical technique.

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:24.250
And that's important if
you're a graduate student

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.170
in the chemistry
department, wherever,

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.290
even an undergraduate, and
you have worked long and hard

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.590
to synthesize some
natural product that's

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.530
15 steps into a
synthesis, you've only

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.350
got a half milligram
of that, and it's

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:40.780
a year's worth of
your life's work,

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.930
you don't want to destroy
that sample analyzing it.

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.080
So you can take
that sample, and you

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.850
can put it in a small, little,
cylindrical glass tube.

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:53.050
You can analyze it.

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.320
And then you can take
that sample back out

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:57.880
and use it for something else.

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:06.640
So the technique allows you
to determine connectivity

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.597
within a molecule.

00:03:08.597 --> 00:03:10.180
So I've drawn-- this
is something I'll

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:11.815
bring up a spectrum of later.

00:03:11.815 --> 00:03:13.840
It's just three heptanone.

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:19.210
But it will allow you to see
that protons on this terminal

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:24.700
carbon are connected to that
and next to a carbon here

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.350
that has two protons on it.

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:29.350
So it looks through
bond connectivity.

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:33.250
And it won't necessarily give
you connectivity all the way

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.370
through the molecule, but
you can build up, say,

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.920
this chunk of the
molecule and this chunk.

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.420
And then you can
link it together--

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.740
picture linking together a chain
that allows you to put together

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:46.660
the whole molecule.

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:51.010
It will also show you
interactions through space.

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:53.680
I'm not going to embarrass
myself and try and draw

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.040
a protein.

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.790
But there can be two
parts of a molecule that

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:00.860
are hundreds of atoms
away from each other

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:03.140
if you were to try and go
through the chemical bonds.

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.800
Yet they're held near
each other in space.

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:09.430
And you can monitor
how close they are.

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:12.460
And that helps determine the
three-dimensional structure

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:13.370
of molecules.

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:18.290
And so all the time protein
structures are solved by NMR.

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:22.290
And you can use it to
monitor other processes too,

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:26.930
such as whether a protein
has bound a small molecule,

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:30.740
whether there's hindered
rotation about a bond,

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:32.190
so something like--

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:33.110
where did my chalk go?

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:46.010
If you take something
like dimethylformamide,

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:51.390
this bond here has partial
double bond character.

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:55.670
And you can see separate
peaks for those methyl groups.

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:58.880
And you can rationalize it
by the hindered rotation

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:01.370
around that bond.

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:02.930
And there even other techniques.

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:07.062
And so everybody is going to
be familiar with what NMR is.

00:05:07.062 --> 00:05:09.020
And hopefully none of
you have had to have one,

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:12.860
but it's the same physical
technique as an MRI.

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:15.710
So here's an MRI
of, unfortunately,

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:18.560
my daughter's head after
she swam into the pool

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:20.150
end in a swim match.

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:24.710
Nothing happened to her, but
you can take pictures with NMR.

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:29.090
In the past, I've used it
to take pictures of insects.

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:32.120
You can also do
analytical techniques

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:33.800
of in vitro diagnostics.

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:37.580
So there's a test out there
called the NMR LipoProfile.

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:42.650
And it will analyze
your cholesterol, i.e.

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:45.680
the density-- or the
concentration of lipoproteins

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:47.600
that's circulating
around in your blood.

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:54.870
So what is an NMR instrument?

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:58.173
NMR instruments
come in two flavors.

00:05:58.173 --> 00:06:00.090
Or at least-- maybe they
come in more flavors,

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:03.990
but, here at MIT, we have
two types of NMR instruments.

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:06.750
There are ones that are
referred to as high-resolution

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:10.020
instruments, which usually
have a stronger magnet,

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:11.820
and they're bigger.

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:12.990
There are also desk--

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:15.460
they're not desktop, but
benchtop instruments,

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:19.260
which is what you're
going to use in your lab.

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:24.960
So each of these has the
exact same constituent parts.

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:28.320
I didn't go over and try and
take your benchtop instrument

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:30.120
apart to get a
picture of those parts

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:32.160
because I wouldn't have
gotten it back together.

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:33.840
And it would have never worked.

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:36.180
So I'm going to go through
one of our instruments

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:38.040
and show you the
individual parts,

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:40.680
but keep in mind it's the
exact same thing that's

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:42.360
in the instrument
that you'll be using.

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:48.550
So you've got to have
a strong magnetic field

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:50.350
to immerse your sample in.

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:53.350
And obviously that's
supplied by a strong magnet.

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:56.890
So magnets will
come in two flavors.

00:06:56.890 --> 00:07:00.850
In the benchtop instruments,
they are a permanent magnet.

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:03.430
Has anybody ever taken
apart old computers,

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:05.215
and you can get the
hard drives, and there

00:07:05.215 --> 00:07:09.070
are strong magnets in there
that are sort of silver colored?

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:13.960
Those are made from a
neodymium-iron-boron alloy.

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:17.080
And that is what they use for
the permanent magnets that

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:19.630
are in the benchtop systems.

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:23.710
There's been a great improvement
in those in the past, I guess,

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:25.750
15 years or so.

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:28.150
There used not to be any
benchtop instruments.

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:31.900
It was difficult to
engineer and machine

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:35.995
permanent magnets that would
give a uniform magnetic field.

00:07:35.995 --> 00:07:37.370
But they've been
able to do that.

00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:39.287
And so there are a lot
of benchtop instruments

00:07:39.287 --> 00:07:41.350
that are out there now.

00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:46.690
The standard NMR-- well, they're
termed high-resolution NMRs

00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:50.110
because they have stronger
magnetic fields that then can

00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:52.930
be generated from
permanent magnets--

00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:55.220
use what are called
superconducting magnets.

00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:58.690
So the magnetic
field is generated

00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:04.000
by the circulation of electric
charge in a superconductor.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.600
And, if you're familiar with
superconductors, usually,

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:10.780
they have to be below
some specific temperature

00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:15.550
in order to maintain
their conductivity.

00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:18.040
While the temperature,
the critical temperature,

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:21.910
has come up in recent
years for superconductors,

00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:24.160
as far as producing
something that's

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:29.020
easily machinable into wire
that you can wrap into a coil,

00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:32.080
the higher temperature--
higher critical temperature

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:34.453
superconductors aren't
easily malleable.

00:08:34.453 --> 00:08:35.870
So you still have
to use something

00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:38.230
that you've got to
get really cold, i.e.

00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:41.090
down to liquid
helium temperature.

00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:44.950
So, in a superconducting
magnet, you've got--

00:08:44.950 --> 00:08:48.850
think of it as a giant thermos,
which is what this can is.

00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:51.550
You've got a hole through
the center, which is called

00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:54.240
the room temperature bore.

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:57.240
It's room temperature
because it is not cold.

00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:01.480
Your sample, which is
in this little tube

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:04.150
that I showed you
generally, will

00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:08.230
be held in what's
called a spinner, so

00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:09.730
this little blue thing.

00:09:09.730 --> 00:09:12.100
You will put it in
the top of the magnet.

00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:16.090
And it will just ride
down on a cushion of air

00:09:16.090 --> 00:09:18.670
somewhere to about there
in the center of magnet--

00:09:18.670 --> 00:09:20.920
in the center of the magnet.

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:23.590
On the benchtop
instrument, what's nice--

00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:26.790
let's see if I can
back up a slide.

00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:28.450
All you do-- you can
see it, and it'll

00:09:28.450 --> 00:09:31.090
be obvious when you run it
in the lab for yourself.

00:09:31.090 --> 00:09:33.340
You just put the tube
right down in there.

00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:37.760
You don't have to put it
in any specific holder.

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:40.520
So your sample tube
goes down that bore.

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:43.460
From underneath the
instrument comes

00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:47.370
the NMR probe, which I'll
talk about in a second.

00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:50.150
So that superconducting
wire is wound

00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:54.170
in a coil around that
room temperature bore.

00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:58.460
This chamber here, which,
if I could see, is number 6,

00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:03.220
that is a chamber that
is full of liquid helium.

00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:07.690
So, when you set up one of
these magnets, you cool it off.

00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:09.790
You fill that with
liquid helium.

00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:13.690
And then you put a charge on
this superconducting wire.

00:10:13.690 --> 00:10:17.530
And the charge is
about 100 to 200 amps.

00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:20.200
And 200 amps is the
amount of charge

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:21.970
that goes through a
medium-sized house.

00:10:21.970 --> 00:10:24.880
So it's got a good amount
of electricity on there

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:26.740
that's circulating around.

00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:29.170
As long as you keep it
cold, meaning as long

00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:32.530
as you top it off with liquid
helium every few months,

00:10:32.530 --> 00:10:36.950
it's going to remain a magnet
and generate a powerful field.

00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:40.060
So, if you just had liquid
helium touching metal,

00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:43.720
the outside of that metal
would be a big chunk of ice.

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:47.550
So this has an evacuated--

00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:49.750
not layer, but I
guess a portion of it

00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:54.460
that's evacuated with a high
vacuum to provide insulation.

00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:59.320
Outside of that is a
layer of liquid nitrogen.

00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:02.110
And we fill that weekly.

00:11:02.110 --> 00:11:05.740
And that just cuts down on
any thermal transmission,

00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:07.840
even though you've got
a high vacuum there.

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:12.220
And then outside of that is
another high vacuum layer

00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:13.840
and then the room.

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:17.020
And so you can walk up to the
can, and you can touch it.

00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:19.390
And it won't feel cold at all.

00:11:19.390 --> 00:11:21.460
So that's what the
magnet consists of.

00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:30.720
The NMR measurement is based
on the strength of the magnet--

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:33.870
so B0 is what I'm calling that--

00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:37.740
and the gyromagnetic
ratio of the nuclei

00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:39.270
that you're looking at.

00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:41.820
And we're going to talk
about hydrogen today.

00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:47.150
And so you've got to be able to
synthesize precise frequencies

00:11:47.150 --> 00:11:51.260
with precise durations
and power levels

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:53.760
in order to send
those to your sample.

00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:55.580
So you've got this console.

00:11:55.580 --> 00:11:58.280
It's got amplifiers in there.

00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:00.355
100-watt amplifiers is
pretty much the standard.

00:12:00.355 --> 00:12:02.480
Actually, I shouldn't even
say that's the standard.

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:05.330
I think ours have 500-watt
amplifiers in there.

00:12:05.330 --> 00:12:07.020
You've got different boards.

00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:09.110
It used to be that
these all were

00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:12.480
plugged in to these long
things with connections.

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:14.960
And it talked through what was
called a backplane, but, now

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:17.540
that these are modern
digital consoles,

00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:19.820
it all talks via ethernet.

00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:23.060
So everything has an address,
and it talks to each other.

00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:26.100
It routes the signal to
where it needs to go.

00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:28.580
You've also got some
preamplifiers here.

00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:31.310
So all this material
or everything

00:12:31.310 --> 00:12:33.830
that's in the console
will generate the signal

00:12:33.830 --> 00:12:36.650
that is sent to
your sample in order

00:12:36.650 --> 00:12:39.860
to excite it the way
that you need to in order

00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:42.170
to get the information
out that you want to.

00:12:42.170 --> 00:12:46.520
This also will take the signal
that your sample gives off.

00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:51.710
And it will amplify it and
digitize it and send it

00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:55.370
to the computer so that
it can be processed

00:12:55.370 --> 00:12:56.600
into something you can use.

00:13:01.270 --> 00:13:03.442
To send the sample--
well, so the console

00:13:03.442 --> 00:13:04.900
generates all that
signal, but it's

00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:08.360
got to be broadcast to
your sample somehow.

00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:12.280
And so we think of the
probe as the NMR antenna.

00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:16.160
So probes can come in a
number of different formats.

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:19.600
There can be probes
for looking at solids.

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:23.050
So you wouldn't even dissolve
your sample in a liquid.

00:13:23.050 --> 00:13:25.420
There can be what are
called flow probes where

00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:26.490
you've got just--

00:13:26.490 --> 00:13:28.780
we call it a cell, but
it's just a container

00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:30.250
that's a certain volume.

00:13:30.250 --> 00:13:34.210
And you pump your sample up
through a tube into that cell,

00:13:34.210 --> 00:13:36.710
analyze it, and then
you pump it out.

00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:39.340
There's what we call a
micro coil probe, which

00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:40.580
just has a small cell.

00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:43.430
So I've used ones or had them
in the past in other labs

00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:45.680
where it had a 5
microliter cell.

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:48.550
So you could look at just a
very small amount of things.

00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:52.390
There are also probes that
are known as cryogenic probes.

00:13:52.390 --> 00:13:55.270
Those, the electronics
that are in the probe

00:13:55.270 --> 00:13:59.000
are held at liquid helium or
liquid nitrogen temperature.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.338
And, by doing that, it cuts down
on the inherent electric noise

00:14:03.338 --> 00:14:04.630
that's present in the circuits.

00:14:04.630 --> 00:14:06.930
And it makes them
more sensitive.

00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:08.862
So I've brought a probe
here, and you're not

00:14:08.862 --> 00:14:11.320
going to be able to see this
from where you're sitting back

00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:14.080
there, but you can come up and
look at it later if you want.

00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:17.470
Your benchtop instrument will
have the same stuff in it.

00:14:17.470 --> 00:14:20.280
It's just not going to
look like this exactly.

00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:23.950
So this is what gets inserted up
from the bottom of the magnet.

00:14:23.950 --> 00:14:26.200
And it's just-- it's
screwed in, and it stays

00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:27.520
in the bottom of the magnet.

00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:30.040
There's only a
couple of connections

00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:34.450
where the wires from the
console are hooked up to this.

00:14:34.450 --> 00:14:37.180
And so this one, I can
take the cover off of.

00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:39.730
And you can look at
this when you come up.

00:14:39.730 --> 00:14:45.100
Up in the very top of the probe,
there's a little glass insert.

00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:47.350
And there's some
flat ribbons of wire

00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:48.850
that are wound around here.

00:14:48.850 --> 00:14:50.270
And so I've got
that pointed out.

00:14:50.270 --> 00:14:53.350
In fact, I think that's the same
probe that I took a picture of.

00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:58.670
And so your sample
will go down, and it

00:14:58.670 --> 00:15:04.020
will go right into where
those coils of wire are.

00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:06.910
And so the coils of wire
will send the signal

00:15:06.910 --> 00:15:10.090
to your sample that's being
generated in the console.

00:15:10.090 --> 00:15:12.250
And then, when that
signal gets turned off,

00:15:12.250 --> 00:15:15.830
your sample will relax back
to its equilibrium state.

00:15:15.830 --> 00:15:18.340
And it will induce
a small voltage

00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:21.430
in these coils, which
gets picked up, sent back

00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:23.680
through that console
and off to the computer

00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:26.630
to generate your spectrum.

00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:28.030
So I will leave this right here.

00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:30.940
If you come up later to look
at it, feel free to pick it up.

00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:31.940
Just be very careful.

00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:32.680
This is glass.

00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:35.780
And you don't want to bang on
it or bend it because it will--

00:15:35.780 --> 00:15:39.070
you can break it, not that
it's working anyways anymore,

00:15:39.070 --> 00:15:41.803
but we like to have
it for demonstrations.

00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:48.880
OK, so the NMR signal
itself, it's generated

00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:51.040
when a collection of
nuclei, meaning your sample,

00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:53.440
is placed in a
strong magnetic field

00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:56.800
and irradiated with
radio frequency energy

00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:58.180
of the appropriate frequency.

00:15:58.180 --> 00:16:00.790
And we'll see what
that is in a second.

00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:03.190
The signal is a very
small amount of energy

00:16:03.190 --> 00:16:07.600
that's given off, as the nuclei
in your sample transition

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:10.130
back to their equilibrium state.

00:16:10.130 --> 00:16:12.850
And it's really-- it's a
time-dependent current that's

00:16:12.850 --> 00:16:17.890
induced in the coil in the probe
on the order of microvolts.

00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:25.900
So it possesses four different--
four properties and only

00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:28.420
four properties
that we make use of.

00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:32.590
So pictured right here
is an actual NMR signal.

00:16:32.590 --> 00:16:35.230
It's what we call a
free induction decay.

00:16:35.230 --> 00:16:38.530
It's just a damped sinusoid.

00:16:38.530 --> 00:16:44.540
And, out of that, you can
get these four properties

00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:46.610
that you can make use of.

00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:51.780
The one that we usually make the
most use of is the frequency.

00:16:51.780 --> 00:16:54.050
And so I'll tell you
how you can convert this

00:16:54.050 --> 00:16:57.590
to this in a few
slides, but where

00:16:57.590 --> 00:17:00.920
lines will appear on
this graph tells us

00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:03.590
something about the
molecular environment

00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:08.180
that whatever gave rise
to that signal is in.

00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:12.109
So that's when-- most of the
time, that's what you use.

00:17:12.109 --> 00:17:15.170
The next most common piece of
information you use out of it

00:17:15.170 --> 00:17:16.700
is the intensity.

00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:20.780
So the intensity of a
resonance in the NMR spectrum

00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:24.680
is going to be directly
proportional to the number

00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:29.510
of nuclei that give
rise to that signal.

00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:31.970
And that doesn't
mean just-- well,

00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:34.910
it also means just every
nuclei that's in there,

00:17:34.910 --> 00:17:37.580
but specifically, for
instance, if you've

00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:41.870
got one signal from this group
of protons and one signal

00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:44.450
from this group of
protons, their intensity

00:17:44.450 --> 00:17:47.690
is going to be equal because
three protons gave rise

00:17:47.690 --> 00:17:50.180
to this signal,
and three protons

00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:51.990
gave rise to that signal.

00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:56.270
So you can use that as an
internal check in molecules

00:17:56.270 --> 00:18:00.240
to make sure that you're
identifying peaks correctly.

00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:05.420
You can also use it to quantify
molecules, different molecules

00:18:05.420 --> 00:18:08.420
that are present in a sample.

00:18:08.420 --> 00:18:11.240
And you can even
make a sample where

00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:14.960
you've spiked a known
amount of something in there

00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:17.420
to serve as a standard
and then quantify

00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:20.990
the amount of an unknown
that you've put in there.

00:18:20.990 --> 00:18:23.940
Another property is the
phase of this signal.

00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:26.660
So what I'm showing
here is not something

00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:27.830
you're going to acquire.

00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:30.320
It's called a
two-dimensional spectrum,

00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:34.080
but what I'm trying to highlight
is that each of these colors,

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:34.580
be it--

00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:35.420
I called it red--

00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:39.110
I think it might be some
blend of that or blue--

00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:41.060
are a different phase.

00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:43.220
Specifically, think of this.

00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:45.620
Does anybody know what a
two-dimensional map is?

00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:47.420
Ever look at a
topographic map where

00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:52.040
you've got mountains that
are outlined by contours?

00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:53.178
So you can think--

00:18:53.178 --> 00:18:53.970
what did I call it?

00:18:53.970 --> 00:18:55.220
So I said blue is negative.

00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:58.080
So think of the negative--

00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:02.270
think of the blue cross peaks
as being holes or going down

00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:02.960
into the plane.

00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:06.270
And think of the red ones
coming out of the plane.

00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:11.660
So the way that this
experiment is acquired,

00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:15.980
it makes methylene groups
have a negative phase.

00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:19.940
And it makes methyl and methine
groups have a positive phase.

00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:22.970
So that's really useful when
you're looking at an unknown

00:19:22.970 --> 00:19:25.440
because, right off the
bat, you can just say,

00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:27.530
OK, I know that this,
this, this, and this

00:19:27.530 --> 00:19:29.390
are from a methyl or methine.

00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:32.420
And I know that these blue
peaks are from methylenes.

00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:34.130
And then, specifically,
I can look at it

00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:36.680
and say, OK, since this one
and this one are in a line

00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:38.420
next to each other,
I know that these

00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:41.990
are protons on the same carbon.

00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:46.010
The last piece of information
that comes out of an NMR signal

00:19:46.010 --> 00:19:47.630
is the duration of the decay.

00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:49.020
So it can be longer.

00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:50.270
It can be shorter.

00:19:50.270 --> 00:19:53.480
You can use that like
for things like I hinted

00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:55.820
at before where you
have-- small molecules

00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:58.580
usually have a long decay.

00:19:58.580 --> 00:20:01.320
Large molecules usually
have a very short decay.

00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:04.490
So, if you have a protein
that's binding a small molecule

00:20:04.490 --> 00:20:09.170
substrate, its decay is going
to transition from something

00:20:09.170 --> 00:20:10.520
long to something short.

00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:14.150
And you can use that to
tell that your molecule has

00:20:14.150 --> 00:20:16.080
been bound.

00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:19.646
Any questions?

00:20:19.646 --> 00:20:23.650
All right, so unfortunately
not all nuclei

00:20:23.650 --> 00:20:26.650
can be measured by NMR.

00:20:26.650 --> 00:20:30.340
Any nucleus that
possesses angular momentum

00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:33.010
will exhibit a magnetic
moment that will

00:20:33.010 --> 00:20:37.000
interact with a magnetic field.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:38.590
Just like electrons,
if you've learned

00:20:38.590 --> 00:20:41.890
about in general chemistry where
you learned the quantum numbers

00:20:41.890 --> 00:20:45.960
and you learned about spin,
it's the same for nuclei.

00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:48.610
So we say a nucleus possesses
spin in reference to its spin

00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:52.210
quantum number,
which is labeled I.

00:20:52.210 --> 00:20:56.170
It's easy to think of nuclei
as cute little balls that

00:20:56.170 --> 00:21:00.130
are rotating around, but
remember they're not spinning.

00:21:00.130 --> 00:21:02.650
It's just an inherent
physical property

00:21:02.650 --> 00:21:05.860
that seems like they're
little spinning balls when

00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:06.880
they're not.

00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:09.460
So there are rules for
determining if a nucleus has

00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:11.230
spin or not.

00:21:11.230 --> 00:21:15.760
It's present in either half
integer or integer values.

00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:18.680
You don't really have to worry
about that for this class.

00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:22.930
We're going to be looking at
spin 1/2 nuclei protons, which

00:21:22.930 --> 00:21:25.630
are the easiest to interpret.

00:21:25.630 --> 00:21:31.840
And luckily protons have a
99.9885% natural abundance.

00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:37.360
So it's the most sensitive
and strongest NMR signal

00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:41.350
that you can get
out of any nucleus.

00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:42.940
There are, like
I said, the rules

00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:46.000
for determining whether
something has spin.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:47.650
Nuclei with even protons--

00:21:47.650 --> 00:21:50.980
an even number of protons and
an even number of neutrons

00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:52.850
do not have nuclear spin.

00:21:52.850 --> 00:21:55.930
And so they're NMR inactive.

00:21:55.930 --> 00:21:58.930
Unfortunately, the
next most common thing

00:21:58.930 --> 00:22:02.560
that we would love to look at
as organic chemists is carbon.

00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:07.450
And carbon has six protons and
six neutrons for carbon-12.

00:22:07.450 --> 00:22:08.920
And so we can't.

00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:11.050
It's NMR inactive.

00:22:11.050 --> 00:22:14.080
Luckily for us,
though, carbon has

00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:19.330
an isotope that's 1.1% naturally
abundant, which is C-13.

00:22:19.330 --> 00:22:21.250
And we can look at that.

00:22:21.250 --> 00:22:23.890
We take a hit on
sensitivity, but we can still

00:22:23.890 --> 00:22:25.300
get an NMR spectrum of that.

00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:27.190
So that's good.

00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:31.270
Some nuclei have multiple
NMR-active isotopes.

00:22:31.270 --> 00:22:34.330
That doesn't mean they always
appear in the same spectrum.

00:22:34.330 --> 00:22:38.270
They will have different
gyromagnetic ratios.

00:22:38.270 --> 00:22:41.350
So they will appear at
different overall frequencies,

00:22:41.350 --> 00:22:43.720
but you can look
at-- sometimes, you

00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:45.100
can use that to your advantage.

00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:48.310
You could take a
spectrum of 10 boron

00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:50.860
and a separate
spectrum of 11 boron.

00:22:50.860 --> 00:22:56.200
Or a proton, we use the
signal from deuterium

00:22:56.200 --> 00:23:03.400
as a lock signal for the magnet
to focus on and counteract

00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:04.420
its inherent drift.

00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:13.450
So what's the physical
basis of the NMR signal?

00:23:13.450 --> 00:23:16.810
In a magnetic field, all
those little magnetic moments

00:23:16.810 --> 00:23:19.630
are going to adopt
an orientation

00:23:19.630 --> 00:23:22.880
relative to that field.

00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:25.220
The allowed orientation
of these moments

00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:27.260
is going to be explained
by quantum mechanics.

00:23:27.260 --> 00:23:30.890
Luckily, we don't have
to really get into that.

00:23:30.890 --> 00:23:34.100
And the process that nuclei
undergo during an experiment

00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:35.640
can be rationalized in two ways.

00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:37.430
You can think of it
in terms of vectors,

00:23:37.430 --> 00:23:40.310
so which way those little
magnetic fields are pointing,

00:23:40.310 --> 00:23:43.430
or you can think of it in
terms of the energy levels

00:23:43.430 --> 00:23:45.530
that the nuclei
adopt when they're

00:23:45.530 --> 00:23:48.120
put in that magnetic field.

00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:50.630
So I tried to make a
little cartoon here.

00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:52.160
With no magnetic
field, these are

00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:54.920
supposed to just be
all randomly oriented,

00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:58.760
but, when I immerse my
collection of molecules that's

00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:00.950
in my sample in
a magnetic field,

00:24:00.950 --> 00:24:04.790
they will line up and
be either with the field

00:24:04.790 --> 00:24:07.970
or against the field.

00:24:07.970 --> 00:24:10.790
And so, if we look
at one nucleus

00:24:10.790 --> 00:24:13.160
when we place it in
a magnetic field,

00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:15.740
quantum mechanics tells
us that it's not just

00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:17.570
going to point straight up.

00:24:17.570 --> 00:24:21.290
There's got to be some
uncertainty in where

00:24:21.290 --> 00:24:23.250
that nucleus is pointing.

00:24:23.250 --> 00:24:26.450
And so it is going
to precess, meaning

00:24:26.450 --> 00:24:31.040
it's going to rotate around, the
direction of the magnetic field

00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:33.590
with a characteristic
frequency, which

00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:35.090
we call the Larmor frequency.

00:24:35.090 --> 00:24:36.470
It's named for--
what's his name?

00:24:36.470 --> 00:24:38.930
Joseph Larmor who
was a physicist

00:24:38.930 --> 00:24:41.840
back in the late
1800s, early 1900s.

00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:43.880
That frequency is
going to be directly

00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:46.760
proportional to the
strength of the magnet

00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:50.780
that you put your sample in.

00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:54.980
I've unfortunately--
so gyromagnetic ratio

00:24:54.980 --> 00:24:58.640
can be specified in either
radians per second per tesla

00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:00.500
or in hertz per tesla.

00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:04.040
I apologize for not being too
careful in that I will jump

00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:07.340
back and forth between the two.

00:25:07.340 --> 00:25:13.330
And so, for a proton, if we take
a magnet, that's 11.75 tesla

00:25:13.330 --> 00:25:16.420
and we put our
sample in there, it's

00:25:16.420 --> 00:25:20.110
going to precess around
the field at 500 megahertz.

00:25:20.110 --> 00:25:22.690
And so, when we talk
about NMR instruments,

00:25:22.690 --> 00:25:26.210
just as far as
what size they are,

00:25:26.210 --> 00:25:30.970
they are not specified by
the strength of their magnet.

00:25:30.970 --> 00:25:33.250
They're specified
by the frequency

00:25:33.250 --> 00:25:36.220
that a proton
precesses in a field

00:25:36.220 --> 00:25:37.580
with a magnet of that strength.

00:25:37.580 --> 00:25:41.320
So, if you come down to the
DCIF, I'll say I have a 500,

00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:43.990
or I have a 600,
or I have a 400.

00:25:43.990 --> 00:25:46.960
In the undergraduate teaching
labs, you have a 300.

00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:49.780
And I think the benchtop
is a 60 megahertz.

00:25:49.780 --> 00:25:52.930
And I'd have to go
look up in a table

00:25:52.930 --> 00:25:56.590
or do the calculation
how strong in tesla

00:25:56.590 --> 00:26:01.480
a 60 megahertz NMR
magnet is, but that's

00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:02.650
the way it's specified.

00:26:02.650 --> 00:26:04.720
So that's for one
nuclei when you put it

00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:10.570
in the magnetic field,
but our sample is actually

00:26:10.570 --> 00:26:12.070
a bunch of different nuclei.

00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:14.280
Or not-- well, yes, it's a
bunch of different nuclei.

00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:16.480
It's a collection of nuclei.

00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:21.160
We don't have to keep track
of every individual nucleus

00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:22.690
and deal with the
quantum mechanics

00:26:22.690 --> 00:26:24.760
when we look at
an NMR experiment.

00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:29.720
We can treat the whole sample
as a collection of the nuclei,

00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:33.430
so summing up all the individual
magnetic moments, and just

00:26:33.430 --> 00:26:35.470
look at the bulk magnetization.

00:26:35.470 --> 00:26:38.260
And so we can use statistical
mechanics in order

00:26:38.260 --> 00:26:41.030
to figure out what's going on.

00:26:41.030 --> 00:26:43.120
So we put our nucleus--

00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:44.200
here's our sample.

00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:47.680
We've got, say, 10
milligrams of material.

00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:50.530
We've got it dissolved
in about 600 microliters

00:26:50.530 --> 00:26:52.060
of a deuterated solvent.

00:26:52.060 --> 00:26:55.540
We drop it down so it goes
in our probe in the magnet.

00:26:55.540 --> 00:26:57.970
And our collection
of nuclei will

00:26:57.970 --> 00:27:01.450
start precessing either
aligned with the field

00:27:01.450 --> 00:27:04.850
or aligned opposite the field.

00:27:04.850 --> 00:27:08.860
So there will be a slight
energetic preference

00:27:08.860 --> 00:27:13.060
for those nuclei to have
their magnetic moment aligned

00:27:13.060 --> 00:27:14.890
with the field.

00:27:14.890 --> 00:27:17.530
And that population
difference will

00:27:17.530 --> 00:27:20.020
result in this net
magnetization that we

00:27:20.020 --> 00:27:23.626
call the bulk magnetization.

00:27:23.626 --> 00:27:24.850
Let me put that down.

00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:31.100
We can jump from
thinking of vectors

00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:33.020
to thinking of energy levels.

00:27:33.020 --> 00:27:36.200
So everything that is
aligned with the field

00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:39.170
is going to be at a
lower energy level.

00:27:39.170 --> 00:27:43.310
And we call that just
the plus 1/2 nuclei.

00:27:43.310 --> 00:27:45.740
And everything that is
aligned against the field

00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:49.670
is going to be at a higher
energy level at negative 1/2.

00:27:49.670 --> 00:27:54.080
And so the difference
between these two levels

00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:58.970
is going to increase as the
strength of the magnetic field

00:27:58.970 --> 00:28:00.950
increases.

00:28:00.950 --> 00:28:03.560
And so maybe over here,
on the 60 megahertz,

00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:05.340
the difference is
only that much,

00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:09.230
but, when you get to our
600, it's a lot more.

00:28:09.230 --> 00:28:12.620
Here's where the measurement--
or the principle behind the NMR

00:28:12.620 --> 00:28:13.610
measurement comes in.

00:28:13.610 --> 00:28:18.140
You're making nuclei transition
from one energy level

00:28:18.140 --> 00:28:19.730
to the other energy level.

00:28:19.730 --> 00:28:23.690
So you're perturbing their
equilibrium distribution,

00:28:23.690 --> 00:28:26.180
and then you're letting
them relax back.

00:28:26.180 --> 00:28:28.280
And that's what
gives off the signal

00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:29.580
that we make use of in NMR.

00:28:32.340 --> 00:28:36.020
So I guess I jumped too
far ahead in my verbiage.

00:28:36.020 --> 00:28:39.310
So we have our sample in there.

00:28:39.310 --> 00:28:40.570
It's lined up.

00:28:40.570 --> 00:28:43.180
And we perturb it
with an RF pulse.

00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:45.580
So now I've jump
back to vectors.

00:28:45.580 --> 00:28:50.440
If you think of it in terms
of vectors, when you generate

00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:52.870
that radio frequency
pulse that has

00:28:52.870 --> 00:28:55.330
the frequency equal to the
difference in those energy

00:28:55.330 --> 00:28:59.170
levels, you are, in
essence, generating

00:28:59.170 --> 00:29:01.810
a small magnetic
field that is aligned.

00:29:01.810 --> 00:29:03.700
In this case, it's
arbitrary, but we'll

00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:06.160
say it's aligned
along the x-axis.

00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:09.190
That acts to topple--

00:29:09.190 --> 00:29:13.210
or not topple, tip this bulk
magnetization vector off

00:29:13.210 --> 00:29:17.830
of being pointed with the main
field over into the xy-plane.

00:29:17.830 --> 00:29:24.560
It's still precessing around at
that characteristic frequency.

00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:27.730
And, when it has a
component in the xy-plane,

00:29:27.730 --> 00:29:31.690
that will generate a current
in these little coils

00:29:31.690 --> 00:29:35.650
in the probe, which is then
received back at the console

00:29:35.650 --> 00:29:37.610
and sent to the computer.

00:29:37.610 --> 00:29:40.450
So we pulse our sample.

00:29:40.450 --> 00:29:43.518
And depending on how long
we turn on that pulse for--

00:29:43.518 --> 00:29:45.310
and it's usually the
order of microseconds.

00:29:45.310 --> 00:29:48.790
I think our pulses are set up
to be about 10 microseconds.

00:29:48.790 --> 00:29:53.420
We can tip this over
to some varying degree.

00:29:53.420 --> 00:29:55.360
And so usually we
try and tip it over

00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:59.740
by a specific amount, which is
a 90-degree pulse, because that

00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:04.060
will generate the maximum amount
of signal that we can get out.

00:30:04.060 --> 00:30:06.070
So we tip it over
into the xy-plane.

00:30:06.070 --> 00:30:08.320
We turn off that pulse.

00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:11.020
And then we let it relax,
and we collect our signal.

00:30:13.625 --> 00:30:15.750
Our signal-- I think I said
this before-- is called

00:30:15.750 --> 00:30:17.250
the free induction decay.

00:30:17.250 --> 00:30:19.380
And so here's another
diagram of it.

00:30:19.380 --> 00:30:21.640
We've turned off that pulse.

00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:23.500
The signal is
precessing here, but it

00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:26.020
relaxes back so that
the component here

00:30:26.020 --> 00:30:28.300
gets shorter and shorter
while we grow back

00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:30.490
the component in
the z-direction.

00:30:30.490 --> 00:30:32.200
That gives us this voltage--

00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:33.680
and my laser died--

00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:36.680
that gets picked up in the coil.

00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:39.770
We can do that multiple times.

00:30:39.770 --> 00:30:41.260
So, if you've got
a strong sample,

00:30:41.260 --> 00:30:43.870
you can just take
one scan, but usually

00:30:43.870 --> 00:30:45.940
we'll take multiple
scans because you

00:30:45.940 --> 00:30:48.550
can do what's called
signal averaging, which

00:30:48.550 --> 00:30:51.380
is add them together.

00:30:51.380 --> 00:30:55.540
And that can help you remove
artifacts, increase your signal

00:30:55.540 --> 00:30:58.365
to noise, and other things.

00:30:58.365 --> 00:30:59.740
So that's what
the free induction

00:30:59.740 --> 00:31:02.920
decay is in the NMR signal.

00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:09.970
I put this back in my slide
pack after I gave the slides

00:31:09.970 --> 00:31:11.290
to Professor Dolhun to print.

00:31:11.290 --> 00:31:14.440
So you don't have this in
your handouts unfortunately.

00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:15.580
This is just--

00:31:15.580 --> 00:31:18.280
I was thinking this
is still a good way

00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:21.220
to show about the NMR signal,
but in terms of the number

00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:23.450
of spins and the energy levels.

00:31:23.450 --> 00:31:25.960
So here's your equilibrium.

00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:28.360
You've got more spins pointing.

00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:31.300
I'm saying they're pointing
down in this lower energy level.

00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:35.290
You pulse it, and that
equalizes the energy level.

00:31:35.290 --> 00:31:37.360
So I forget how
many are in each,

00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:39.800
but these are supposed to be
an equal number of arrows.

00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:42.880
Then, after you
turn off that pulse,

00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:46.630
the spins that got transitioned
to the upper energy level

00:31:46.630 --> 00:31:48.310
will relax back down.

00:31:48.310 --> 00:31:49.870
So there's a
predominantly-- they're

00:31:49.870 --> 00:31:52.780
more predominantly in the lower
energy than the upper energy.

00:31:52.780 --> 00:31:58.160
As they do that, they give
off the free induction decay,

00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:01.490
which is your NMR signal.

00:32:01.490 --> 00:32:02.490
Are these any questions?

00:32:07.390 --> 00:32:11.146
OK, so what do we
do with that FID?

00:32:11.146 --> 00:32:12.650
Now, I've been doing this--

00:32:12.650 --> 00:32:14.920
I don't know-- since 1999.

00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:16.390
I can look at an FID.

00:32:16.390 --> 00:32:18.370
I can say, well,
that's a long one.

00:32:18.370 --> 00:32:20.320
I can look at an
FID and say, yeah,

00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:23.380
that's got several different
frequencies in there.

00:32:23.380 --> 00:32:25.610
But, as far as looking
at an FID and saying,

00:32:25.610 --> 00:32:28.810
oh, that comes from DMF or, oh,
that comes from ethyl acetate,

00:32:28.810 --> 00:32:30.850
no, I can't do that.

00:32:30.850 --> 00:32:32.830
And I doubt that
anybody else could.

00:32:32.830 --> 00:32:38.000
So we have to transform that
and somehow make sense of it.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:41.540
And so that is done using
a Fourier transform.

00:32:41.540 --> 00:32:44.680
And so a Fourier
transform takes something

00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:47.890
that is in the time domain.

00:32:47.890 --> 00:32:52.300
And it transforms it to
the frequency domain.

00:32:52.300 --> 00:32:56.770
And, a long time ago, before
the advent of computers,

00:32:56.770 --> 00:33:00.880
NMR wasn't done using Fourier
transforms because it was

00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:03.080
computationally too difficult.

00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:06.160
And so someone
back in the '60s--

00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:08.800
actually, someone famous
at IBM developed a way

00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:10.880
to do this to make it
a little bit easier,

00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:12.820
but they still had to
print out little cards.

00:33:12.820 --> 00:33:14.110
And you'd punch holes in them.

00:33:14.110 --> 00:33:17.410
And it would take days and
days to feed it into a machine.

00:33:17.410 --> 00:33:19.960
And nowadays your
phone can do it.

00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:21.398
It's got more
computational power

00:33:21.398 --> 00:33:22.940
than something that
had a whole room.

00:33:22.940 --> 00:33:26.080
So everything is done by
Fourier transform now.

00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:28.600
That gives us our
spectrum, which

00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:31.210
consists of lines,
which we can look at,

00:33:31.210 --> 00:33:35.790
and we can interpret
and figure out.

00:33:35.790 --> 00:33:38.850
And, no, I couldn't do a
Fourier transform or solve one

00:33:38.850 --> 00:33:40.890
in my head or even on paper.

00:33:40.890 --> 00:33:44.650
So it's just something
the computer does.

00:33:44.650 --> 00:33:45.610
So let's back up.

00:33:45.610 --> 00:33:48.730
I've given away a lot of this
because I've already showed

00:33:48.730 --> 00:33:52.520
you several spectra, and you see
that there are multiple lines.

00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:55.450
But here's the free
curve for the equation

00:33:55.450 --> 00:33:58.900
for the frequency
being proportional

00:33:58.900 --> 00:34:00.430
to the magnetic field strength.

00:34:00.430 --> 00:34:04.090
And you might think,
OK, I have protons.

00:34:04.090 --> 00:34:08.170
Why don't I just get one
peak because I have protons?

00:34:08.170 --> 00:34:10.060
And I would have
one peak for protons

00:34:10.060 --> 00:34:12.820
and one peak for other nuclei.

00:34:12.820 --> 00:34:16.570
If it did that, I wouldn't be up
here talking to you about this

00:34:16.570 --> 00:34:19.389
because, while it might be
a fine and dandy measurement

00:34:19.389 --> 00:34:23.500
for a physicist to use,
it'd be useless for us

00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:25.330
in chemistry because
we'd only get

00:34:25.330 --> 00:34:29.530
one peak for all the different
protons that are in our sample.

00:34:29.530 --> 00:34:32.469
Luckily, when you
put your sample

00:34:32.469 --> 00:34:37.150
in a magnet, whatever the
local magnetic environment is

00:34:37.150 --> 00:34:41.020
that the nuclei
reside in, that is

00:34:41.020 --> 00:34:46.659
going to modify the [INAUDIBLE]
or the external field

00:34:46.659 --> 00:34:48.940
that those nuclei feel.

00:34:48.940 --> 00:34:52.330
And so that's what spreads
out our single signal

00:34:52.330 --> 00:34:57.680
from a proton into the different
regions of the spectrum.

00:34:57.680 --> 00:34:59.770
So this is supposed
to be ethyl acetate.

00:34:59.770 --> 00:35:01.970
I've got a doubly
bound oxygen here.

00:35:01.970 --> 00:35:04.600
I've got a single bound oxygen
here, a methylene, methyl,

00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:05.730
and methyl.

00:35:05.730 --> 00:35:10.510
So oxygen, I think everybody
might know is electronegative.

00:35:10.510 --> 00:35:11.410
It's really greedy.

00:35:11.410 --> 00:35:13.720
It doesn't like to
share its electrons.

00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:16.870
So it pulls electron
density away

00:35:16.870 --> 00:35:18.550
from things that are nearby it.

00:35:18.550 --> 00:35:21.310
And that's why I've got
these little deltas up here,

00:35:21.310 --> 00:35:24.830
indicating the partial
negative charge.

00:35:24.830 --> 00:35:27.100
The things that are
bound closest to it

00:35:27.100 --> 00:35:30.280
and even further out, they're
going to be more positively

00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:32.140
charged or partial
positively charged

00:35:32.140 --> 00:35:34.690
than they would have been
because the electron density is

00:35:34.690 --> 00:35:36.470
being pulled away from it.

00:35:36.470 --> 00:35:39.760
So that's what helps
spread out those signals.

00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:42.850
We call this chemical shift.

00:35:42.850 --> 00:35:45.550
It's denoted on a
spectrum as ppm.

00:35:45.550 --> 00:35:47.810
And, oftentimes, it's
denoted with delta,

00:35:47.810 --> 00:35:49.540
not to be confused
with the delta I've

00:35:49.540 --> 00:35:51.940
used for the small charges,
but you might see that

00:35:51.940 --> 00:35:53.890
on the axis of it.

00:35:53.890 --> 00:35:56.650
So anything that can
perturb electron density

00:35:56.650 --> 00:36:00.730
will affect we call it the
shielding of the nucleus,

00:36:00.730 --> 00:36:05.860
not only electronegative things,
where nuclei are oriented

00:36:05.860 --> 00:36:08.800
in relation to double bonds.

00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:14.320
In a benzene ring, you've got
the clouds of electron density

00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:16.810
in those pi orbitals.

00:36:16.810 --> 00:36:21.010
And things that get
oriented directed into that

00:36:21.010 --> 00:36:22.060
will be more shielded.

00:36:22.060 --> 00:36:25.630
Things that are sticking off
the ring equatorially-- or not

00:36:25.630 --> 00:36:28.870
equatorially, but in the
plane will be deshielded.

00:36:28.870 --> 00:36:30.312
So that has an effect.

00:36:30.312 --> 00:36:32.020
So all these things
will combine together

00:36:32.020 --> 00:36:36.150
to spread out what's
in your spectrum.

00:36:36.150 --> 00:36:41.890
So here is just a spectrum
of my ethyl acetate.

00:36:41.890 --> 00:36:43.490
And so notice I've
spread it out.

00:36:43.490 --> 00:36:44.740
Well, I haven't spread it out.

00:36:44.740 --> 00:36:49.000
It is spread out into
three separate signals.

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:56.640
You can use NMR solely as
a fingerprint and tabulate.

00:36:56.640 --> 00:37:02.268
I know that only such and such
resonances come at 2 point--

00:37:02.268 --> 00:37:02.810
I don't know.

00:37:02.810 --> 00:37:04.470
We'll call that 2.01.

00:37:04.470 --> 00:37:07.720
And so you can go look in
a table and say, oh, well,

00:37:07.720 --> 00:37:11.280
this must be from one of these
small subset of molecules

00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:14.220
because they only have
something at 2.01.

00:37:14.220 --> 00:37:16.350
It's more important to
be able to rationalize

00:37:16.350 --> 00:37:19.360
where things appear by--

00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:21.630
or yeah, where things
appear on this spectrum

00:37:21.630 --> 00:37:23.100
by where they are
in the molecule

00:37:23.100 --> 00:37:26.740
because that will help you
analyze the spectrum better.

00:37:26.740 --> 00:37:29.550
So, if we look at this,
we've got three peaks.

00:37:29.550 --> 00:37:31.800
Now, I talked about
intensity being

00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:34.320
one of the properties
of the signal earlier.

00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:36.190
I don't know if
you can see this,

00:37:36.190 --> 00:37:42.360
but there's a 3.10 under
there, a 3.10 under here,

00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:44.830
and a 2 under here.

00:37:44.830 --> 00:37:48.900
So that's the relative
intensity of those signals.

00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:53.370
Now, one thing that is common
when you're first learning NMR

00:37:53.370 --> 00:37:58.560
is to think that the integrals
are dead on exact so that it

00:37:58.560 --> 00:38:00.270
should be 3.00.

00:38:00.270 --> 00:38:03.780
No, it's going to be close,
but it's not going to be exact.

00:38:03.780 --> 00:38:06.180
You've got to take
great care when you're

00:38:06.180 --> 00:38:10.320
acquiring the spectrum to
get your integrals to be

00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:13.350
as close to perfect.

00:38:13.350 --> 00:38:15.370
So we'd call 3.1 3.

00:38:15.370 --> 00:38:18.343
So we know-- we can
look at our molecule.

00:38:18.343 --> 00:38:19.510
We've got two methyl groups.

00:38:19.510 --> 00:38:22.170
So we can guess that these are
both from the methyl groups

00:38:22.170 --> 00:38:26.220
because they integrate the 3 and
that this is from the methylene

00:38:26.220 --> 00:38:28.140
because it integrates to 2.

00:38:28.140 --> 00:38:33.060
So why is this methylene all
the way down at 4 and these

00:38:33.060 --> 00:38:34.050
are up here?

00:38:34.050 --> 00:38:36.390
Well, what's the
methylene next to?

00:38:36.390 --> 00:38:38.260
It's bound straight
to the oxygen.

00:38:38.260 --> 00:38:42.180
So the oxygen is withdrawing
the electron density away

00:38:42.180 --> 00:38:43.350
from that methylene.

00:38:43.350 --> 00:38:48.390
And it is shifting the peak what
we call downfield, which means

00:38:48.390 --> 00:38:52.440
to the left on an NMR spectrum.

00:38:52.440 --> 00:38:55.110
That's a leftover term
from in the old days

00:38:55.110 --> 00:38:56.250
when they would sweep.

00:38:56.250 --> 00:38:58.890
You would actually adjust the
frequency-- or not frequency.

00:38:58.890 --> 00:39:00.660
You'd adjust the
strength of the magnet.

00:39:00.660 --> 00:39:03.450
So anything that was
down in this direction

00:39:03.450 --> 00:39:05.760
used a weaker magnetic
field strength.

00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:07.830
Anything that was
up in this direction

00:39:07.830 --> 00:39:11.100
used a stronger
magnetic field strength.

00:39:11.100 --> 00:39:12.450
Nowadays, we don't do that.

00:39:12.450 --> 00:39:15.030
The magnet is always
just what the magnet is,

00:39:15.030 --> 00:39:16.710
but those terms
are still around.

00:39:16.710 --> 00:39:18.360
So anything to the
left is downfield.

00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:20.440
Anything to the
right is upfield.

00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:22.800
So this one is
deshielded the most.

00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:25.290
It is at 4.1.

00:39:25.290 --> 00:39:29.940
The next peak is this one.

00:39:29.940 --> 00:39:31.500
Now, we've got to choose.

00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:34.620
Is it from this methyl,
or is it from this methyl?

00:39:34.620 --> 00:39:38.340
And so you would look, and
you'd say, OK, both of these

00:39:38.340 --> 00:39:42.000
are bound to carbon, but the
carbon that this one is bound

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:46.350
to is a carbon that is
doubly bound to an oxygen.

00:39:46.350 --> 00:39:50.100
So electron density is being
drawn away from that carbon

00:39:50.100 --> 00:39:52.530
by the oxygen. So
that's still going

00:39:52.530 --> 00:39:55.620
to also have electron
density being pulled away

00:39:55.620 --> 00:39:57.570
from this methyl.

00:39:57.570 --> 00:40:00.690
And so that's going
to shift it down here.

00:40:00.690 --> 00:40:03.450
This carbon is just
bound to a plain carbon

00:40:03.450 --> 00:40:06.360
without a double
bound oxygen on it.

00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:10.030
And so it's not
deshielded as much.

00:40:10.030 --> 00:40:13.170
Although, if I took
a spectrum that had--

00:40:13.170 --> 00:40:17.350
so, if I just had an
alkane like pentane

00:40:17.350 --> 00:40:19.950
and I looked at the
terminal methyl on pentane,

00:40:19.950 --> 00:40:23.940
it would be over here because
it would not be deshielded

00:40:23.940 --> 00:40:27.210
at all compared to this.

00:40:27.210 --> 00:40:29.130
Another thing you
might be questioning

00:40:29.130 --> 00:40:35.910
is, why are these ones
split into multiple peaks,

00:40:35.910 --> 00:40:38.948
but this one is
only a single peak?

00:40:38.948 --> 00:40:40.740
Let me make sure I kept
my slides in order.

00:40:40.740 --> 00:40:41.970
OK, I did.

00:40:41.970 --> 00:40:45.480
That is due to what
is called coupling.

00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:50.250
So protons that are
bound to a carbon

00:40:50.250 --> 00:40:55.050
will, in essence, talk to
protons on neighboring carbons

00:40:55.050 --> 00:40:56.640
through the bonds.

00:40:56.640 --> 00:41:01.750
And it's called spin-spin
coupling or scalar coupling.

00:41:01.750 --> 00:41:06.600
And so you will have
protons split apart

00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:08.220
into characteristic patterns.

00:41:10.910 --> 00:41:12.230
What else?

00:41:12.230 --> 00:41:17.090
So the splitting on
those peaks is not

00:41:17.090 --> 00:41:20.420
dependent on the
main field so that,

00:41:20.420 --> 00:41:23.540
if I took that ethyl acetate
spectrum-- and I forget

00:41:23.540 --> 00:41:24.410
what strength.

00:41:24.410 --> 00:41:27.920
I maybe will say I acquired
that at 500 megahertz.

00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:31.400
And I measured the difference
between those peaks.

00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:32.630
And we'll say it's 8 hertz.

00:41:32.630 --> 00:41:34.940
If I take that
molecule, I put it

00:41:34.940 --> 00:41:38.870
in a gigahertz machine,
which is twice as strong,

00:41:38.870 --> 00:41:43.930
and I measure the splitting,
it'll still be that same value.

00:41:43.930 --> 00:41:49.010
So, for simple spectra, the
splitting follows what's called

00:41:49.010 --> 00:41:50.720
the n+1 rule.

00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:57.200
And so you look at the number of
protons on neighboring carbons,

00:41:57.200 --> 00:41:58.520
and you add that up.

00:41:58.520 --> 00:42:00.550
So I guess I should have
drawn another molecule.

00:42:00.550 --> 00:42:02.280
Where did my chalk go?

00:42:02.280 --> 00:42:05.900
So, for instance, we'll
take this one here.

00:42:05.900 --> 00:42:11.880
So CH3, I've got two
protons over here.

00:42:11.880 --> 00:42:14.670
So it's going to give
me a simple spectrum.

00:42:14.670 --> 00:42:20.100
So it's going to be split
by 2 plus 1 equals 3.

00:42:20.100 --> 00:42:21.540
And let's see.

00:42:21.540 --> 00:42:29.780
I'm going to close this and
bring up my real spectrum.

00:42:29.780 --> 00:42:37.060
So this spectrum
is of 3-heptanone.

00:42:37.060 --> 00:42:41.240
And the methyl
here and the methyl

00:42:41.240 --> 00:42:46.380
here are these two
resonances over there.

00:42:46.380 --> 00:42:49.220
And so you can, in
fact, see that those

00:42:49.220 --> 00:42:52.490
are split into three
peaks because each of them

00:42:52.490 --> 00:42:55.400
has two protons next to it.

00:42:55.400 --> 00:42:57.920
Now, not everything
behaves that way.

00:42:57.920 --> 00:43:00.680
When you get into more
complicated molecules,

00:43:00.680 --> 00:43:06.900
splitting can be completely
non-rationalizable.

00:43:06.900 --> 00:43:09.110
So there are several
ways that can happen.

00:43:09.110 --> 00:43:12.560
The most common way is, when the
difference in chemical shifts

00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:18.050
between two nuclei is not much
bigger than their coupling

00:43:18.050 --> 00:43:21.950
constant, you'll just get a
whole bunch of different peaks.

00:43:21.950 --> 00:43:24.390
I can drag up an example
of that in a second.

00:43:24.390 --> 00:43:25.210
So let's see.

00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:33.690
Oops, OK, so that crashed.

00:43:33.690 --> 00:43:35.900
Oh well, so I won't do that.

00:43:35.900 --> 00:43:38.930
OK, so I've given
you a table in there

00:43:38.930 --> 00:43:40.738
that gives some of
the common splitting

00:43:40.738 --> 00:43:42.030
patterns that you will observe.

00:43:42.030 --> 00:43:42.320
Yes?

00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:44.980
AUDIENCE: So what do you mean
when you say simple spectrum?

00:43:44.980 --> 00:43:49.420
JOHN GRIMES: A simple spectrum
is where the splitting obeys

00:43:49.420 --> 00:43:51.610
this n+1 rule.

00:43:51.610 --> 00:43:55.510
And so all the multiplets
will be analyzable that way.

00:43:55.510 --> 00:43:57.370
And you'll know it.

00:43:57.370 --> 00:43:59.200
If you look at
something and you don't

00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:03.370
see these common patterns,
you can automatically

00:44:03.370 --> 00:44:07.000
say, OK, there's more complex
splitting that's going on in

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:08.200
or non-first-order.

00:44:14.300 --> 00:44:20.390
The intensities of those peaks
in a first-order multiplet

00:44:20.390 --> 00:44:23.960
will obey or agree
with the coefficients

00:44:23.960 --> 00:44:25.700
of a binomial expansion, i.e.

00:44:25.700 --> 00:44:27.660
Pascal's triangle.

00:44:27.660 --> 00:44:34.040
So, for n equals 2, you will get
1 to 2 to 1 and, for 3, 1 to 3

00:44:34.040 --> 00:44:34.940
to 3 to 1.

00:44:34.940 --> 00:44:37.490
So they will obey that.

00:44:37.490 --> 00:44:41.450
If it was non-first-order,
you might see four peaks,

00:44:41.450 --> 00:44:44.435
but you wouldn't have that
same intensity pattern.

00:44:48.810 --> 00:44:53.400
So here's some other
examples of NMR spectra.

00:44:53.400 --> 00:44:55.050
Here's a simple one, ethanol.

00:44:55.050 --> 00:44:58.440
We can look at this, and we
can rationalize where the peaks

00:44:58.440 --> 00:45:00.760
appear in the same fashion.

00:45:00.760 --> 00:45:04.020
We've got a methyl
group and a methine.

00:45:04.020 --> 00:45:07.260
So, if we look at
the methyl group,

00:45:07.260 --> 00:45:10.330
we see that there's one, two
protons next to each other.

00:45:10.330 --> 00:45:12.990
So we would expect
the resonance for that

00:45:12.990 --> 00:45:16.740
to be split into
three separate peaks.

00:45:16.740 --> 00:45:19.440
And there, in fact,
we see a triplet.

00:45:19.440 --> 00:45:22.380
And then, for the methylene,
not that it's default now

00:45:22.380 --> 00:45:25.500
because there's nothing-- or
that's the only other one,

00:45:25.500 --> 00:45:27.570
you would expect one,
two, three, four peaks.

00:45:27.570 --> 00:45:28.950
And you see that.

00:45:28.950 --> 00:45:31.510
And now this is tricky.

00:45:31.510 --> 00:45:35.350
Why do you not get
three peaks for the OH,

00:45:35.350 --> 00:45:39.104
even though it's got
two protons next to it?

00:45:39.104 --> 00:45:44.040
OH and NH have
exchangeable protons.

00:45:44.040 --> 00:45:47.760
And so the proton
is coming on and off

00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:51.990
that molecule in a faster
time period than the NMR

00:45:51.990 --> 00:45:52.560
measurement.

00:45:52.560 --> 00:45:58.380
So you just see an average
of the chemical shifts,

00:45:58.380 --> 00:46:00.510
meaning it gives
you a single peak,

00:46:00.510 --> 00:46:04.170
rather than splitting
into a triplet.

00:46:04.170 --> 00:46:06.420
These didn't come out
very big, but it's just

00:46:06.420 --> 00:46:09.570
showing you, with bigger
molecules, you get more peaks.

00:46:09.570 --> 00:46:12.150
If you zoom in on these,
you'll see that a lot of these

00:46:12.150 --> 00:46:15.810
do not give simple triplets
or quartets or doublets,

00:46:15.810 --> 00:46:19.770
that you've got a lot of more
complex splitting going on

00:46:19.770 --> 00:46:21.140
in the molecule.

00:46:25.140 --> 00:46:28.070
And so here's an
example of an ester.

00:46:28.070 --> 00:46:32.300
I think that you all are going
to be synthesizing esters.

00:46:32.300 --> 00:46:34.985
So, if we look at
these two compounds--

00:46:34.985 --> 00:46:36.360
and something I
didn't point out,

00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:39.260
well, I'll show you
this in another slide--

00:46:39.260 --> 00:46:42.200
anything that appears
in an aromatic ring

00:46:42.200 --> 00:46:44.270
is going to be deshielded.

00:46:44.270 --> 00:46:46.130
So it's going to
be far downfield.

00:46:46.130 --> 00:46:47.480
And I think I said that before.

00:46:47.480 --> 00:46:51.770
You've got the electron
density of the pi orbitals

00:46:51.770 --> 00:46:55.110
above and below the ring,
which would shield something.

00:46:55.110 --> 00:46:57.800
But those protons are held
not there, but straight out

00:46:57.800 --> 00:46:58.410
from the ring.

00:46:58.410 --> 00:47:00.500
So they're in a
deshielded region.

00:47:00.500 --> 00:47:02.240
So, right off the
bat, we can look,

00:47:02.240 --> 00:47:05.630
and we can say, OK, we
know that this must be--

00:47:05.630 --> 00:47:11.630
or these peaks must be from the
protons on the phenyl rings.

00:47:11.630 --> 00:47:13.880
Unfortunately, there's no
integration on here, but you

00:47:13.880 --> 00:47:16.160
also, if I had the
integration values,

00:47:16.160 --> 00:47:18.560
you would see that those
both integrate to 5.

00:47:18.560 --> 00:47:21.200
And that would tell you
something about it too.

00:47:21.200 --> 00:47:25.050
So now the question
becomes, which

00:47:25.050 --> 00:47:27.570
splitting patterns
in this region

00:47:27.570 --> 00:47:33.330
down here agree with
what we see up here?

00:47:33.330 --> 00:47:36.590
So, if we look at
our ester, we see

00:47:36.590 --> 00:47:41.090
that, on this ester
over here, we've got--

00:47:41.090 --> 00:47:42.710
and we saw this ethyl acetate.

00:47:42.710 --> 00:47:47.520
We have the methyl and the
methylene bound to the oxygen.

00:47:47.520 --> 00:47:50.780
So we know that the
methyl and the methylene

00:47:50.780 --> 00:47:55.340
are going to split into
a triplet and a quartet.

00:47:55.340 --> 00:47:58.580
And we know that
that quartet is going

00:47:58.580 --> 00:48:03.810
to be shifted downfield because
it's bound to that oxygen.

00:48:03.810 --> 00:48:06.080
Now, that's not to say
that also, in this one,

00:48:06.080 --> 00:48:09.360
they're not going to be split
into a triplet and a quartet.

00:48:09.360 --> 00:48:12.110
But this carbonyl
carbon is not going

00:48:12.110 --> 00:48:17.130
to drag the peak as far
downfield as it does over here.

00:48:17.130 --> 00:48:24.810
So we can say that this
compound here is from this one.

00:48:24.810 --> 00:48:28.020
And this peak right here
is my single methylene

00:48:28.020 --> 00:48:30.180
that doesn't have any
protons next to it,

00:48:30.180 --> 00:48:35.448
whereas this compound over
here is this one here.

00:48:35.448 --> 00:48:36.240
Did I just do that?

00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:38.370
No, I just said that backwards.

00:48:38.370 --> 00:48:41.890
This compound here is this one.

00:48:41.890 --> 00:48:43.810
This compound here is this one.

00:48:43.810 --> 00:48:47.560
So here's the single
methylene, and here it is.

00:48:47.560 --> 00:48:50.280
Here's the methylene that's
split into a quartet.

00:48:50.280 --> 00:48:54.100
And it's right there,
whereas, on this one,

00:48:54.100 --> 00:48:56.490
this methylene is shifted
a little farther downfield

00:48:56.490 --> 00:48:59.040
because now it's
bound to the oxygen.

00:48:59.040 --> 00:49:02.190
Does that make
sense to everybody?

00:49:02.190 --> 00:49:02.690
OK.

00:49:08.170 --> 00:49:10.810
I'm not going to go
over this completely.

00:49:10.810 --> 00:49:11.840
You can look at this.

00:49:11.840 --> 00:49:13.960
You can also look up--
you can find stuff

00:49:13.960 --> 00:49:15.440
like this online everywhere.

00:49:15.440 --> 00:49:18.130
This is a fellow
over in England who

00:49:18.130 --> 00:49:21.130
puts out these graphics
called Compound Chem.

00:49:21.130 --> 00:49:23.200
I don't know if anybody
follows him on Twitter,

00:49:23.200 --> 00:49:27.170
but he's got all sorts of great
chemistry education graphics.

00:49:27.170 --> 00:49:29.230
This is one that just
gives you an idea

00:49:29.230 --> 00:49:32.710
of the different chemical shift
values and where things appear.

00:49:32.710 --> 00:49:35.650
And so you can see an
OH on a carboxylic acid

00:49:35.650 --> 00:49:38.440
is going to be very deshielded.

00:49:38.440 --> 00:49:42.350
Amide protons are going to be
in this region and et cetera.

00:49:42.350 --> 00:49:44.470
So that I can give
you some idea of where

00:49:44.470 --> 00:49:46.210
to look for resonances.

00:49:50.830 --> 00:49:54.700
I said that we can
take spectra of carbon.

00:49:54.700 --> 00:49:57.970
Carbon is a lot less
sensitive than proton.

00:49:57.970 --> 00:50:01.120
In fact, sensitivity-wise,
if you just

00:50:01.120 --> 00:50:05.590
compare the gyromagnetic
ratio of carbon to proton,

00:50:05.590 --> 00:50:07.810
it's a fourth of proton.

00:50:07.810 --> 00:50:11.740
So, like I said, we
specify our magnets

00:50:11.740 --> 00:50:15.040
by the precession
frequency of protons.

00:50:15.040 --> 00:50:17.740
So, on a 500-megahertz
instrument,

00:50:17.740 --> 00:50:22.210
it would be a 125-megahertz
carbon instrument.

00:50:22.210 --> 00:50:25.630
So you take that one
fourth of a hit because

00:50:25.630 --> 00:50:28.390
of the gyromagnetic
ratio, but then

00:50:28.390 --> 00:50:32.230
you also take a big
hit because only 1.1%

00:50:32.230 --> 00:50:35.020
of the carbon present
in your sample

00:50:35.020 --> 00:50:39.100
is made of carbon-13, which
is the NMR-active carbon.

00:50:39.100 --> 00:50:43.060
The rest of it is carbon-12,
which is NMR inactive.

00:50:43.060 --> 00:50:46.960
But you can still
acquire carbon spectrum.

00:50:46.960 --> 00:50:50.920
A carbon spectra has a much
bigger frequency spread.

00:50:50.920 --> 00:50:53.440
So you don't have
overlap as much.

00:50:53.440 --> 00:50:55.780
That can be very useful.

00:50:55.780 --> 00:51:01.030
And this combined with
a proton can tell you

00:51:01.030 --> 00:51:02.890
a lot about your molecule.

00:51:02.890 --> 00:51:05.650
You're not going to acquire
these on the benchtop

00:51:05.650 --> 00:51:06.160
instrument.

00:51:06.160 --> 00:51:08.050
Although, I guess
it probably will

00:51:08.050 --> 00:51:10.390
if you have a very, very
concentrated sample.

00:51:15.790 --> 00:51:18.100
This is just to show an example.

00:51:18.100 --> 00:51:21.285
You can do very complex
samples or experiments.

00:51:21.285 --> 00:51:24.260
So this is a three-dimensional
spectrum of a protein.

00:51:24.260 --> 00:51:26.740
So this is something you would
use in determining a protein

00:51:26.740 --> 00:51:28.630
structure.

00:51:28.630 --> 00:51:30.300
I've never acquired
one of these.

00:51:30.300 --> 00:51:33.250
So all I can tell
you is that you're

00:51:33.250 --> 00:51:36.490
looking both at carbon
resonance-- what

00:51:36.490 --> 00:51:37.490
do we have up here?

00:51:37.490 --> 00:51:38.500
Oh OK, sorry.

00:51:38.500 --> 00:51:41.140
So it's the protein
was expressed

00:51:41.140 --> 00:51:46.300
by bacteria that were growing in
food that was labeled with N-15

00:51:46.300 --> 00:51:50.740
and C-13 so that
there's incorporation

00:51:50.740 --> 00:51:52.210
of those nuclei in there.

00:51:52.210 --> 00:51:55.940
And it will give you a
signal, and you can use that.

00:51:55.940 --> 00:51:56.440
Let's see.

00:51:56.440 --> 00:51:59.840
I'm almost finished, but I
think we're about out of time.

00:51:59.840 --> 00:52:03.530
Sample preparation, when
you're preparing your samples,

00:52:03.530 --> 00:52:08.150
it is important to
prepare clean samples.

00:52:08.150 --> 00:52:11.700
There should not be particulate
matter in your samples.

00:52:11.700 --> 00:52:16.220
You should filter them if you
do have particulate matter

00:52:16.220 --> 00:52:18.830
from your reaction
because that will--

00:52:18.830 --> 00:52:23.060
having particles in there will
lead to poorer spectra that

00:52:23.060 --> 00:52:26.300
will be difficult to interpret.

00:52:26.300 --> 00:52:29.360
NMR are the very thin,
glass-walled tubes.

00:52:29.360 --> 00:52:31.660
So be careful with them.

00:52:31.660 --> 00:52:34.980
If you snap this, you can
easily stick it in your hand.

00:52:34.980 --> 00:52:37.660
So be very careful with that.

00:52:37.660 --> 00:52:41.390
Use a deuterated solvent when
you're preparing your samples.

00:52:41.390 --> 00:52:44.030
I think you will be given
that by your TAs anyways.

00:52:44.030 --> 00:52:46.430
And never put a dirty
tube in the instrument.

00:52:46.430 --> 00:52:50.780
You should always clean the
tube off on the outside.

00:52:50.780 --> 00:52:55.940
And then I think the last slide
that I have is about shimming.

00:52:55.940 --> 00:52:58.400
Shimming is adjusting
the homogeneity

00:52:58.400 --> 00:53:00.180
of the magnetic field.

00:53:00.180 --> 00:53:03.990
So, if you remember
from that equation--

00:53:03.990 --> 00:53:08.670
and you don't even have to
know how to solve this--

00:53:08.670 --> 00:53:15.980
so your frequency is
directly proportional

00:53:15.980 --> 00:53:18.880
to the magnetic field strength.

00:53:18.880 --> 00:53:22.900
Shimming means making your
magnetic field homogeneous

00:53:22.900 --> 00:53:27.940
so that the top of your sample
feels the same strength field

00:53:27.940 --> 00:53:30.010
as the bottom of your sample.

00:53:30.010 --> 00:53:32.950
The machine will do
it automatically,

00:53:32.950 --> 00:53:35.560
but, if the top of
your sample feels

00:53:35.560 --> 00:53:38.170
a different magnetic field
strength than the bottom,

00:53:38.170 --> 00:53:41.320
then it's going to have two
separate frequencies for where

00:53:41.320 --> 00:53:45.040
those protons precess, which
means the line broadens out.

00:53:45.040 --> 00:53:46.810
And, if that line
broadens out, it

00:53:46.810 --> 00:53:50.140
makes it harder to interpret.

00:53:50.140 --> 00:53:53.960
And then I'll skip
over this one.

00:53:53.960 --> 00:53:56.240
The last thing, I
guess, questions, I

00:53:56.240 --> 00:53:58.670
put in some references in here.

00:53:58.670 --> 00:54:01.040
This is a great thing
to do with old magnets.

00:54:01.040 --> 00:54:03.110
If you're artistic
with cutting tools,

00:54:03.110 --> 00:54:06.710
I would love to have my own
pizza oven with an old magnet.

00:54:06.710 --> 00:54:09.130
So, if anybody has any
questions, please let me know.

00:54:09.130 --> 00:54:10.338
AUDIENCE: Pretty cool lesson.

00:54:14.660 --> 00:54:17.150
JOHN GRIMES: And no, that's
not a friend of mine's either.

00:54:17.150 --> 00:54:20.664
I just snagged that off the web.

00:54:20.664 --> 00:54:22.530
AUDIENCE: That's hilarious.

00:54:22.530 --> 00:54:23.850
JOHN GRIMES: Anything else?

00:54:23.850 --> 00:54:24.350
Thank you.

00:54:24.350 --> 00:54:25.637
[APPLAUSE]

00:54:25.637 --> 00:54:27.720
And, if you want to look
at this if you have time,

00:54:27.720 --> 00:54:29.530
you can come up.

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:06.780
JOANNE STUBBE: We spend a
lot of time looking at--

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:10.860
all proteins are made from
amino acid building blocks.

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.280
And so one question I get,
and students hate this,

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.360
is, why do I need to know?

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.530
I make them memorize the side
chains of the amino acids.

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:21.650
Why do I do that?

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:23.400
Because the side chains
of the amino acids

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.890
are the key to the way all
the catalysts in your body

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:27.390
function.

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.240
A catalyst simply
enhances the rate

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.130
of conversion of
some small molecule

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.940
into some other small
molecule, and it

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.040
can enhance the rate
of the interconversion

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.020
by 10 to the 15th fold.

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.520
So if you didn't
have that catalyst,

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.350
you couldn't do anything.

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.790
So amino acid side chains
play a key role in catalysis.

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:52.770
So thinking about the
chemical properties

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.340
of the amino acid side chains
is key to understanding

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.010
all the transformations
in your body.

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.250
So, what is the
pKa of imidazole?

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.000
You remember that?

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.400
Huh?

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:03.800
GUEST SPEAKER: I don't.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:04.200
I don't.

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.075
JOANNE STUBBE: How can
you not remember that?

00:01:06.075 --> 00:01:06.677
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:06.677 --> 00:01:12.180
Anyhow, the pKa of imidazole
is close to seven, OK.

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.560
So those physiological--
everything in the body

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:15.320
is controlled.

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.710
The pH has to be controlled.

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.750
And so that means that you can
protonate or deprotonate it.

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.130
So knowing that is key to
thinking about how the chemical

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.130
reaction is going to work.

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.380
The amino acid side chains now--

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.360
everybody thought there
were 22 amino acids.

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.270
But now we know almost
all these amino acids can

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.270
be modified once they
get into the protein,

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.210
so that's called
post-transational modification.

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.860
So now we have, probably,
another 250 modifications.

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.460
And one of the modifications
that is essential,

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.910
not for the catalysis
part of proteins,

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:00.480
but for the structural
part of proteins,

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:04.530
is hydroxylation of
the amino acid proline.

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.020
So if you don't
hydroxylate proline,

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.310
then you can't make this
molecule called collagen.

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.950
And collagen is a
structural protein.

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.970
It's 25% of all
humans' protein, OK.

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.060
And it's found extracellularly.

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.220
Gram per gram it has
the strength of steel.

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.420
It has very complicated
biosynthetic pathway.

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.610
It has amazing tensile strength.

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.900
It's found in cartilage
and teeth and bone.

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:40.650
And a key component of collagen
is this hydroxylated proline.

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.890
Because without it, you can't
form the actual collagen

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:45.390
structure.

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.232
So collagen is this
long-- most proteins,

00:02:49.232 --> 00:02:51.690
if you look at the structures,
they look like little balls.

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:52.950
They're globular.

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:58.220
But collagen is a fibrillar
protein, so it's very long.

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:59.960
it's probably the
longest protein, too.

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:03.330
It's 3,000 angstroms long.

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.380
And it has three chains
initially, and they

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.870
they're left-handed sort of
helixes but not real helixes,

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.540
and they have to wind
around each other

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.650
to form a right-handed helix.

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.870
This all happens
inside the cell, then

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.780
somehow has to get to
the outside of the cell.

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.670
People are studying that now.

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:24.120
And then it forms
additional fibrils,

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.100
and they become insoluble.

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:30.660
And that provides the strength--
the extracellular structures

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.720
provide the strength that
maintain the cell's shape

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.850
and viability of the cell.

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:40.290
And a key component of all that
is hydroxylation of proline.

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:41.460
And how did they find that?

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:44.530
This goes back to,
again, misregulation.

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:47.010
So, in the 1600s,
or whenever they

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.830
used to sail the ocean
blue with no food,

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:51.690
they didn't have
enough vitamin C.

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.080
So they didn't have
any citrus fruit.

00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:01.780
So vitamin C has the
vitamin ascorbate,

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:07.080
and ascorbate plays a
key role in the chemistry

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:11.070
of allowing the proline
to become hydroxylated.

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:13.410
So it turns out,
to get the proline

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:16.050
to be hydroyxlated,
you use, again,

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:17.550
metal catalyzed reactions.

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:20.269
So here's iron-2.

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:22.510
And if that iron-2
reacts with oxygen,

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:25.890
if it gets oxidized with
iron-3, it can't react.

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:28.200
So the function
of this vitamin is

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.830
to keep the iron-2
in the reduced state.

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:32.820
So there's an example.

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:34.080
People study that.

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.060
Took them many,
many, many years,

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.130
like 200 years later,
when they really

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:42.630
understand the details of
how this post-translational

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:44.440
modification actually occurs.

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.590
And we understand a lot
about that chemistry now.

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:51.570
And this was the first one of
these modifications discovered,

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:54.930
and now they're finding this
modification everywhere.

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:59.130
So lots of amino acids turn out
to be hydroxylated, not just

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:00.930
proline.

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.660
So these modified
amino acids now,

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:08.160
because the technology we
have is so mind boggling,

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.770
we can find a needle
in a haystack.

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:12.330
Whereas in the
beginning we were just

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:14.820
trying to figure out what
the amino acids were,

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:18.210
now we have very, very
sensitive analytical methods

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:22.320
which allow us to see all
of these modifications.

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.360
Then the key question
is, what is the function

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:25.260
of the modification?

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.290
And that's not so easy
in terms of thinking

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:29.640
about regulation, anyhow.

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:34.377
And that's the focus of a lot
of people's efforts right now.

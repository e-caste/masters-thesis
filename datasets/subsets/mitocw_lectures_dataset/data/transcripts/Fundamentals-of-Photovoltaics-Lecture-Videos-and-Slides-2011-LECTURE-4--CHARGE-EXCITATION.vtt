00:00:26.049 --> 00:00:28.090
PROFESSOR: Why don't we
go ahead and get started.

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:29.590
What we're going
to be talking about

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:32.250
today, is what happens after
that photon gets absorbed.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.900
So we spent a great deal of
time in our last lecture talking

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.533
about light absorption, the
interaction between light

00:00:36.533 --> 00:00:37.610
and the semiconductor.

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:39.360
Now we're going to
talk about what happens

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.270
once that light is absorbed.

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.520
So we're in the
fundamental section.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:44.252
We're right here.

00:00:44.252 --> 00:00:45.960
Later on, we'll get
into the technologies

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.250
and the cross cutting themes.

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.720
As we go through
the fundamentals,

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.360
I'm going to attempt to
relate those fundamentals

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.670
to real solar cell technology.

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.895
So you're not left
kind of floating,

00:00:55.895 --> 00:00:58.020
wondering why it is that
we're studying this stuff,

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.645
but you're really
seeing the connection

00:00:59.645 --> 00:01:01.660
to solar cell devices.

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.857
So first if we remind everyone
of the broader picture

00:01:05.857 --> 00:01:08.190
that the conversion efficiency,
the ultimate performance

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.880
of the device, is defined as the
output energy versus the input

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:12.850
energy.

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.890
And for most solar
cells, this breaks down

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.064
into the inputs and the outputs.

00:01:17.064 --> 00:01:18.480
The input being
the solar spectrum

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.100
and the output being the
collection of charge.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.440
And there are multiple processes
that occur here in the middle.

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.370
Light absorption, we
talked about last time.

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:29.180
We're going to be talking about
charge excitation in charge

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.157
transport today, mostly
charge excitation.

00:01:32.157 --> 00:01:32.990
So we're right here.

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:34.070
We're going to be
marching steadily

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.260
down toward the right over
the next few lectures.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.080
And let me remind
you, everybody,

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:39.960
that the efficiency
of the device

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.370
is the product of each
individual efficiency

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:43.610
of each different step.

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.980
So if anything is
going wrong here,

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:47.680
it will be limiting
device performance.

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.888
And the image you should
definitely have in your mind

00:01:49.888 --> 00:01:52.540
is of that bucket, with
each plank representing

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.750
a different component
of the device, perhaps

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:57.980
a different physical
process or perhaps

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:00.920
a different physical component
of the device itself.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.180
And whatever is the
poorest, is going

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.080
to be limiting
overall performance.

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.460
Your efficiency is going to be
flowing out from that low plank

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:10.210
and you will have a
low efficiency device.

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:12.470
So the art of making a
high efficiency solar cell

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:13.886
is really understanding
everything

00:02:13.886 --> 00:02:15.660
that goes into the
physical processes,

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.070
but also the devices.

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.660
And that's why we break
it down like this.

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.760
We have the physical
processes, and finally we

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.130
get into some of the
devices in the architectures

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.700
of manufacturing methods.

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.220
So learning objectives today.

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.930
Oops.

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:29.720
That was a little bit of a typo.

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:30.940
It's not the solar resource.

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.160
We're talking about
charge excitation today.

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.210
We will be talking phenomena
logically how this thing called

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:38.150
a band gap forms.

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.310
It's a very important
physical concept.

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.100
We'll lead off the
lecture with it,

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:44.940
and then very quickly
go into applications

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.600
that you see why it's
important, returning back

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.524
to the fundamentals,
how it actually forms,

00:02:49.524 --> 00:02:50.940
going back and
forth until we have

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.750
a pretty solid understanding.

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.400
From the background surveys,
I understand that about 50%

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.560
of you understand
what a band gap is.

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.650
So 50% of you may be a little
bored, or a little entertained,

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.960
at my hand wave explanations
during the first part of class.

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.360
I encourage you to
think about the band gap

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.360
from the perspective of
the solar cell device,

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.060
because this is probably not
something you've done before.

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.518
You've probably
understood band gap

00:03:12.518 --> 00:03:15.160
from the perspective of
a semiconductor device as

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.570
packaged in the dark, perhaps
in a little gadget like this.

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:21.281
But not something
that's exposed to light

00:03:21.281 --> 00:03:23.030
with the addition of
a generation current.

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:24.250
Or at least not in detail.

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:25.756
So I welcome you
to think about that

00:03:25.756 --> 00:03:27.130
as we go through
the explanations

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:28.520
in the beginning of class.

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:31.960
Then we'll describe how optical
absorption in semiconductors

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:35.450
represents the transitions
of charge in an energy band

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:35.950
diagram.

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:39.080
In other words, if
we imagine a given

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.740
space of the
semiconductor divisive,

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:44.280
say a surrounding
of a given atom,

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.700
and we imagine that different
orbitals, different electron

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.480
orbitals will have different
energies associated with them.

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.849
We are going to be talking
about how light gets absorbed

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:54.140
in transitions electrons
between those different energy

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:55.890
orbitals.

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:57.610
That's important
because then we'll

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:59.600
be able to calculate
the fraction of photons

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:04.265
lost, not absorbed, by a
given semiconductor material.

00:04:04.265 --> 00:04:06.390
We'll be able to calculate
the fraction of incident

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.730
solar energy that is lost
as well, due to a phenomenon

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.360
called thermalization.

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.810
And finally, we're
going to be able to plot

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.310
efficiency versus
band gap, and denote

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:16.570
specific materials on it.

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.529
In other words, we are going to
be doing our first higher level

00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:21.760
efficiency calculations
for a solar cell device

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.750
by the end of today's lecture.

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:26.620
And the idea is to expose a
little bit on the technology

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.422
side as well, so that you have
an appreciation for what's

00:04:30.422 --> 00:04:32.630
up and coming in the field,
what are some of the ways

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:36.430
to enhance the performance
of social devices.

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:37.747
So band gap.

00:04:37.747 --> 00:04:38.955
Very, very basic description.

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:45.740
If you've never been
exposed to band gaps before,

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.090
the reason it's important
is because the band gap

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:50.370
is going to define
what color, what

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:52.550
portion of the solar
spectrum that material

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:55.410
absorbs light most efficiently.

00:04:55.410 --> 00:05:00.140
How a band gap forms is related
to the atomic structure.

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:04.270
Think of bonds as essentially
why stuff is tough.

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:06.260
If the mechanical
engineers in the room,

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.750
if you remember
linear elasticity,

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:10.360
those bonds are
what are essentially

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.193
forming those springs
between the atoms that

00:05:12.193 --> 00:05:15.170
are keeping them, the
material, from flying apart.

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:17.220
There is also a very
interesting property here,

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:18.920
that if you have
a bound electron,

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:21.360
it's usually not moving
very far that atom.

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.450
It's usually in a very
localized electronic state

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:26.120
close to that atom.

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:30.500
So if you were to apply a
resistance meter, an Ohm meter,

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:33.630
to your device to measure
the resistance across it,

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:36.020
and you had just
bound electrons,

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:38.810
you would measure a very,
very low current passing

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:39.870
through that material.

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:43.070
Because there would be very few
free charge carriers to move

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:45.609
in that applied field, when
you apply the two probes

00:05:45.609 --> 00:05:47.650
and there's a little
battery in here that applies

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:49.930
a field across the
material, you wouldn't

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:51.644
be able to measure
much current flow,

00:05:51.644 --> 00:05:54.060
because there wouldn't be too
many free electrons to carry

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:55.380
that current.

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:58.159
So the bound
electrons essentially

00:05:58.159 --> 00:05:59.700
enhance the strength
of the material.

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:02.490
But it doesn't help us from a
semiconductor point of view.

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:04.860
What we need are
excited electrons.

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:07.260
And excited electrons are
why materials conduct.

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.532
So let's imagine we have a bond.

00:06:09.532 --> 00:06:10.990
For example, in
this material right

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:16.915
here, these gray lines
are really two electrons

00:06:16.915 --> 00:06:18.040
that are covalently bonded.

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:19.706
Essentially two
electrons-- one electron

00:06:19.706 --> 00:06:22.500
from each little black circle
representing a carbon atom.

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:24.740
And each electron associated
with that carbon atom

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:27.670
is shared with the other,
in a covalent bond.

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:29.420
And for the chemists
in the room, more

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:31.410
precisely, you have
sp3 hybridized orbitals

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:33.330
in this diamond cubic
crystal structure.

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:35.720
For everyone else, these
are shared electrons

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:37.880
in a covalent bonding
configuration.

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:39.762
Now if light comes in
with enough energy,

00:06:39.762 --> 00:06:41.970
it can excite an electron
from that covalently bonded

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:44.710
state into an excited state,
where it can then roam freely

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:46.147
throughout the lattice.

00:06:46.147 --> 00:06:47.980
And that's the nature
of charge excitations.

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:49.605
So the big question
that we have to ask

00:06:49.605 --> 00:06:51.980
ourselves is, what
color of light

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:54.480
will this material
absorb most effectively?

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:56.560
Will those electrons
in the covalent bonds

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:58.722
absorb light and be
excited into a state

00:06:58.722 --> 00:07:00.680
where they can roam freely
around the material,

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:03.500
and ultimately
conduct electricity?

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:04.000
OK.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.230
So the answer to that
question is not simple.

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:11.770
Understanding how
a band gap forms

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:14.590
can be an entire semester
of quantum physics.

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:18.230
But what we're going to do is
do it in a three step approach.

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:19.990
Simple, very, very
simple explanations

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:22.830
that hopefully
everyone will get.

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:24.730
The next most
simple explanation,

00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:28.100
which hopefully 80% of
you will get, and then

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:31.410
perhaps a more detailed
explanation that only a few

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:32.540
of you will get.

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:34.560
But the idea is
to really progress

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:38.120
in levels of explanation.

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:40.411
So let me go back one step.

00:07:40.411 --> 00:07:40.910
Yeah.

00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:43.502
The band gap energy can
be most simply understood

00:07:43.502 --> 00:07:44.960
as a finite amount
of energy needed

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:47.170
to excite a highly
localized electron

00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:49.720
into a de-localized excited
state in the semiconductor

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:52.920
where it can move
around the crystal.

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:53.670
OK.

00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:56.620
So this is the description
of the band gap,

00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:59.100
how a band gap forms that
you'll see in many chemistry

00:07:59.100 --> 00:07:59.625
textbooks.

00:07:59.625 --> 00:08:02.000
And I like it, because it's
something that you can really

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.654
grasp and understand.

00:08:04.654 --> 00:08:06.320
We have to start with
the simple premise

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:10.330
that electrons are a type of
particle called a fermion.

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:11.350
What is a fermion?

00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:14.240
Let's refresh our
basic physics here.

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:16.870
What means a fermion?

00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:18.010
Spin one half.

00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:21.430
And it also means-- can two
fermions occupy the same state?

00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:22.100
No, they can't.

00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:23.300
Bosons can.

00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:24.680
But fermions cannot.

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:27.200
And so what happens when you
put two fermions together

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:28.540
in a system?

00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:32.340
And say we have
discretized quantum states.

00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:34.320
We begin filling up from
the bottom up, right?

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:35.190
Typically.

00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:37.900
So the lowest energy
states get occupied first.

00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:40.735
You have, for example, spin up,
spin down in your s orbital.

00:08:40.735 --> 00:08:43.110
And then they begin populating
the next electron orbital.

00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:46.060
Once that's filled, you go to
the next one, and the next one.

00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:48.340
So if we have one
atom in isolation,

00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:50.490
the easiest example
is that hydrogen atom,

00:08:50.490 --> 00:08:52.620
for those who took quantum
mechanics, who actually

00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:55.520
calculated the energy
of the bound electron

00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:59.410
there in the ground state of the
hydrogen atom, around 13.6 eV.

00:08:59.410 --> 00:09:03.870
So imagine now you take a
silicon atom, or carbon atom,

00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:05.930
or something else,
a little bit bigger,

00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:08.160
more electrons in its structure.

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:11.660
So you have the core,
the 1s orbital filled.

00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:14.440
And then you start
progressing outward.

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:15.840
2s2p and so forth.

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:17.834
And so you begin
filling up the orbitals.

00:09:17.834 --> 00:09:19.000
Let's see atomic separation.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.830
So imagine that we have our
atoms infinitely separated.

00:09:21.830 --> 00:09:23.780
So we have just one
atom in the middle

00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:26.170
of an infinite lonely space.

00:09:26.170 --> 00:09:27.160
One atom.

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:30.160
And we would have discrete
energy levels corresponding

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:33.080
to the different orbitals,
the different orbitals

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:35.330
around the nucleus.

00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:37.190
Now imagine the atom
is no longer lonely.

00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:38.374
It now has a partner.

00:09:38.374 --> 00:09:40.790
And you bring those two atoms
closer and closer and closer

00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:41.590
together.

00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:43.870
That's this d getting
closer and closer together.

00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:44.650
What happens?

00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:46.990
Well, electrons are fermions.

00:09:46.990 --> 00:09:50.610
They don't like occupying
the same electronic state.

00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:53.236
So first, the first
shell that's going

00:09:53.236 --> 00:09:54.610
to quote, unquote
see each other,

00:09:54.610 --> 00:09:56.776
the first electron shell
that will interact is what?

00:09:56.776 --> 00:09:59.090
Is it the outermost,
or the innermost?

00:09:59.090 --> 00:09:59.650
Outermost.

00:09:59.650 --> 00:10:00.200
Right?

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:02.140
Because they're the
closest together.

00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:04.098
So you're moving the two
atoms closer together,

00:10:04.098 --> 00:10:06.890
that outermost shell will
begin to quote, unquote see

00:10:06.890 --> 00:10:08.060
the other atom.

00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:10.610
And those electrons will say,
hey, you're occupying my state.

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:12.610
And what will happen is
they'll begin splitting,

00:10:12.610 --> 00:10:15.800
in energy level, and that's
what you see right here.

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:18.840
What this is representing is not
just two atoms coming together,

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:21.199
but a multitude of
atoms coming together.

00:10:21.199 --> 00:10:22.990
And we have to really
imagine, for example,

00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:25.920
and in most matter, we have
something in the order of 10

00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:31.620
to the 22, 10 to the 23
atoms per cubic centimeter.

00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:34.020
So atoms per cubic centimeter.

00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:36.090
Fun math, just total aside.

00:10:36.090 --> 00:10:38.990
If anybody talks about
teletransporttion,

00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:41.020
think about the number
of atoms in your body.

00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:43.140
And assign an
xyz-coordinate to them,

00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:47.276
and then calculate the
amount of data in terabytes.

00:10:47.276 --> 00:10:48.900
And then calculate
our Ethernet speeds,

00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:50.750
and try to figure out how
long it would take to transmit

00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:52.330
that data to the other side.

00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:53.230
Anyway.

00:10:53.230 --> 00:10:54.730
So this is to give
you an impression

00:10:54.730 --> 00:10:57.590
of the density of atoms
within the cubic centimeter.

00:10:57.590 --> 00:10:59.450
So you have a lot of
atoms coming together,

00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:02.280
even though the electron
wave function can

00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:05.450
be highly localized, they still
interfere with each other.

00:11:05.450 --> 00:11:07.440
There's still enough
atoms coming together

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:08.850
that you have this interference.

00:11:08.850 --> 00:11:12.130
And it's not just two electron
states, but many of them

00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:16.290
that are splitting, that
are forming a band of states

00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:18.640
because no two electrons
can occupy the same energy

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:20.710
level as these atoms
are coming together.

00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:23.130
Now, as they become closer
and closer and closer,

00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:25.750
it's not only that outer
shell that begins interacting.

00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:28.130
It's the next most outer shell.

00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:29.890
This one, here, that
begins interacting.

00:11:29.890 --> 00:11:33.900
And finally another
shell, and another shell.

00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:36.660
And so at some
equilibrium distance,

00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:38.330
the equilibrium
distance here defined

00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:40.810
as the attractive
potential between atoms.

00:11:40.810 --> 00:11:44.030
There's an energy gain
by forming that bond.

00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:46.530
And the repulsive
force of the nuclei,

00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:48.567
their large concentration
of positive charge

00:11:48.567 --> 00:11:50.650
in the nucleus, that if
you tried pushing them too

00:11:50.650 --> 00:11:52.990
close together, they'll repel.

00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:55.840
This balance of forces,
the attractive potential

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:58.840
due to that bond formation, the
repulsive force to the nucleic,

00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:01.220
results in an equilibrium
bond distance,

00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:03.390
d, shown here as
this dotted line.

00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:06.390
And at that equilibrium bond
distance, some of the orbitals

00:12:06.390 --> 00:12:09.050
will be forming bands and
other orbitals will still

00:12:09.050 --> 00:12:11.130
be discrete, namely
the core orbitals

00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:12.200
will still be discrete.

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:15.500
The outermost orbitals
here will be forming bands.

00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:19.770
Now an interesting thing
happens when it just so occurs,

00:12:19.770 --> 00:12:21.650
and say, for example,
in the system right

00:12:21.650 --> 00:12:23.980
here, this shell is filled.

00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:25.430
This shell is filled.

00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:28.470
This shell is completely filled.

00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:30.330
And let's imagine that
this orbital exists,

00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:32.040
but it's unpopulated.

00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:33.090
You ran out of electrons.

00:12:33.090 --> 00:12:34.930
And you started
filling in the orbitals

00:12:34.930 --> 00:12:35.900
of this atom over here.

00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:37.800
You had enough for this orbital,
that orbital, that orbital,

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:38.850
but then you ran
out of electrons.

00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:40.140
You didn't have anything more.

00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:42.370
And this band of
states was empty.

00:12:42.370 --> 00:12:45.740
So the band of allowed
states exists up there,

00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:46.660
but it's empty.

00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:49.200
And this band right here
exists, and it's filled.

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:51.750
These core states exist,
and they're filled as well.

00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:53.930
So the action is really
happening right here.

00:12:53.930 --> 00:12:58.370
If light comes in, if
visible light comes in,

00:12:58.370 --> 00:13:01.170
it's probably going to excite an
electron from this filled band

00:13:01.170 --> 00:13:04.970
right here to somewhere in
this unoccupied band up there.

00:13:04.970 --> 00:13:08.870
And this gap, right here,
is an interesting thing.

00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:13.300
There is no stable
electron orbital.

00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:16.770
If you were somehow to take
an electron with that given

00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:19.406
energy, this energy
here, from the vacuum

00:13:19.406 --> 00:13:21.030
and stick it inside
of the system here,

00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:24.840
it would quickly decay
into a stable orbital.

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:27.480
So this is a prohibited
band of states.

00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:29.710
There is no stable
orbital for that electron

00:13:29.710 --> 00:13:31.030
to exist at that energy.

00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:34.800
And hence we call it a band gap.

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:36.490
The reason band gaps
are interesting,

00:13:36.490 --> 00:13:38.890
is because different materials
have different, or can

00:13:38.890 --> 00:13:40.181
have different, size band gaps.

00:13:40.181 --> 00:13:42.200
Some don't have a
band gap at all.

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:45.600
Most of those that don't
have a band gap, because you

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:49.109
have a band of states like
this one that's partially full.

00:13:49.109 --> 00:13:50.650
Let's imagine we
have three electrons

00:13:50.650 --> 00:13:51.649
in this band right here.

00:13:51.649 --> 00:13:52.650
One, two, three.

00:13:52.650 --> 00:13:55.840
And then we have these other
four empty states about it.

00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:58.010
In fact, you have a
partially filled band.

00:13:58.010 --> 00:13:59.740
And let's imagine,
instead of just having

00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:02.210
seven states within that band,
we had a multitude of states

00:14:02.210 --> 00:14:03.570
within that band.

00:14:03.570 --> 00:14:04.910
Almost too many to count.

00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:08.410
And now, with even the
slightest of energy,

00:14:08.410 --> 00:14:10.950
we could excite an
electron from this state

00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:14.470
into that state
plus little delta.

00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:16.600
That would be a metal.

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:18.830
Now if we had a
really big band gap,

00:14:18.830 --> 00:14:20.929
we wouldn't be able
to absorb much light.

00:14:20.929 --> 00:14:22.720
Because you'd need a
large amount of energy

00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:25.430
to excite across that band gap.

00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:27.600
And that would be an
example of, say, glass.

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:28.987
Where light would come in.

00:14:28.987 --> 00:14:31.320
Most of our visible spectrum
makes it through the glass,

00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:34.500
and that's why we see
through the other side.

00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:36.750
And diamonds as well.

00:14:36.750 --> 00:14:37.420
OK.

00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:39.410
So let's review.

00:14:39.410 --> 00:14:41.980
An atom in isolation has
discrete electron energy

00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:42.510
levels.

00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:44.210
And on this diagram
right here, it's

00:14:44.210 --> 00:14:47.040
represented with this d,
the atomic separation being

00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:47.610
way out here.

00:14:47.610 --> 00:14:49.740
We have discrete energy levels.

00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:52.410
And that we can remember from
our basic physics, especially

00:14:52.410 --> 00:14:54.020
the hydrogen atom.

00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:55.970
And as atoms move
closer together,

00:14:55.970 --> 00:14:58.510
as in a crystal, where you
have a regularly repeating

00:14:58.510 --> 00:15:02.010
arrangements of atoms, the
electron wave functions begin

00:15:02.010 --> 00:15:05.000
overlapping, and since
electrons are fermions,

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:09.250
meaning that the two electrons
can't occupy the same state,

00:15:09.250 --> 00:15:13.969
you have a splitting of those
energy levels forming bands.

00:15:13.969 --> 00:15:16.510
And you can see the splitting
as you move from right to left,

00:15:16.510 --> 00:15:18.860
as you move from
further to closer,

00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:20.847
on these diagrams right here.

00:15:20.847 --> 00:15:22.930
First starting with the
outermost states, the most

00:15:22.930 --> 00:15:25.550
valence of electron orbitals,
and then slowly moving

00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:27.950
into the core states as well.

00:15:27.950 --> 00:15:30.450
And the gap between
bands denoting an energy

00:15:30.450 --> 00:15:33.800
range in which no stable orbital
exists is called a band gap.

00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:35.800
Sometimes you'll see it
all written as one word.

00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:39.105
Sometimes there will be a space
between the band and the gap.

00:15:39.105 --> 00:15:39.980
Any questions so far?

00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:44.930
OK.

00:15:44.930 --> 00:15:48.780
So now this explanation should
be relatively straightforward.

00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:50.780
What I want you to
log into your ram,

00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:52.375
because we're going into some
more detailed explanations,

00:15:52.375 --> 00:15:54.360
and I want to set a
marker, a flag, so we

00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:55.736
can come back here afterward.

00:15:55.736 --> 00:15:58.110
And even if you're lost with
the subsequent explanations,

00:15:58.110 --> 00:15:59.090
you still get this one.

00:15:59.090 --> 00:15:59.650
Right?

00:15:59.650 --> 00:16:01.286
So remember these three points.

00:16:01.286 --> 00:16:03.410
If you make a note of them
in your notes, and we're

00:16:03.410 --> 00:16:07.230
going to move on to a few
more explanations here.

00:16:07.230 --> 00:16:12.660
OK, so another way of looking
at this which really builds

00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:15.320
on the folks who have had a more
advanced physics backgrounds,

00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:19.400
is that the wave function
of an electron, inside

00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:22.520
of a crystal-- if
you recall the wave

00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:25.510
function of an electron in
free space, we have what

00:16:25.510 --> 00:16:27.980
is called the plane wave
equation for the electron.

00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:31.720
It's this regular repeating,
nice stable function.

00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:35.660
Now if we introduce that
electron into a crystal,

00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:40.620
it's almost like an infinitely
repeating system of atoms.

00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:42.640
And so you could
envision that you

00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:45.410
could describe the wave
function of that electron

00:16:45.410 --> 00:16:47.860
as a combination
of a plane wave,

00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:50.450
but perturbed by that
locally repeating potential

00:16:50.450 --> 00:16:52.450
from the atomic nuclei.

00:16:52.450 --> 00:16:54.320
And let me be more
specific about

00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:55.720
regular repeating potential.

00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:59.310
What I mean is that you have
a series of nuclei here,

00:16:59.310 --> 00:17:02.360
and if you imagine the electron
potential around these nuclei,

00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:04.530
there is a propensity
for the election

00:17:04.530 --> 00:17:07.109
to be bound by the atom.

00:17:07.109 --> 00:17:10.190
And so as it's moving along,
instead of just a free plane

00:17:10.190 --> 00:17:13.359
wave, now it's almost like
driving along a bumpy road,

00:17:13.359 --> 00:17:15.780
bump, bump, bump.

00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:18.550
And so the wave
function of the electron

00:17:18.550 --> 00:17:20.780
can be described as this
combination or product

00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:23.619
of the wave function
of a plane wave,

00:17:23.619 --> 00:17:27.369
envelope function describing
the electron localization.

00:17:27.369 --> 00:17:29.670
So you have this
localized function here

00:17:29.670 --> 00:17:34.480
and the delocalized function
describing the plane wave

00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:36.930
behavior of the electron as
it moves through space inside

00:17:36.930 --> 00:17:38.350
of the crystal.

00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:42.270
Now what we have as an
easy way to describe this

00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:45.050
mathematically, is we
make an approximation.

00:17:45.050 --> 00:17:50.410
Instead of describing
this potential in detail,

00:17:50.410 --> 00:17:54.280
the easiest way to do this is
to describe this square well

00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:55.450
potential.

00:17:55.450 --> 00:17:57.659
We have a so-called
Kronig-Penney idealization

00:17:57.659 --> 00:17:59.200
of the repeating
Coulombic potential.

00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:01.050
It's easier to
solve numerically.

00:18:01.050 --> 00:18:03.250
And then essentially
what we do is

00:18:03.250 --> 00:18:07.350
we solve Schrodinger's equation
for two possible solutions.

00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:09.550
One is for the electron
wave function centered

00:18:09.550 --> 00:18:11.040
on the atoms themselves.

00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:13.320
So that would be
the bound state.

00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:17.840
And the other is we solve the
equation for electron function

00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:19.410
centered between the atoms.

00:18:19.410 --> 00:18:23.420
So essentially in the
unbound state, right here.

00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:27.032
Which do you think will have
the higher energy level?

00:18:27.032 --> 00:18:28.240
In between the states, right?

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:31.620
Because if the electron wave
function is centered over here,

00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:34.980
it's further away from the
positive charge of the nuclei.

00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:37.290
You need more energy to
put it into that position.

00:18:37.290 --> 00:18:40.870
It's an unbound state, but it's
also at a higher excited energy

00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:41.510
level.

00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:44.000
Whereas if it's bound
around the atoms themselves,

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.860
you would have a
lower energy state.

00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:50.890
In this delta of energy
levels between the bound

00:18:50.890 --> 00:18:53.730
and the excited states
represents the band gap

00:18:53.730 --> 00:18:57.100
of the semiconductor in
this simple approximation

00:18:57.100 --> 00:18:58.190
right here.

00:18:58.190 --> 00:19:01.290
Now you can take that one step
further and say, well, gee,

00:19:01.290 --> 00:19:03.030
if I could solve
that in one dimension

00:19:03.030 --> 00:19:04.780
in a very simple
case, why don't I

00:19:04.780 --> 00:19:07.830
put a three dimensional
structure in place,

00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:11.729
such as a real crystal, and then
solve the Schrodinger equation?

00:19:11.729 --> 00:19:12.770
And sure you can do that.

00:19:12.770 --> 00:19:13.895
You can definitely do that.

00:19:13.895 --> 00:19:18.210
It becomes much more complicated
solution numerically,

00:19:18.210 --> 00:19:21.230
but the general principle
stays roughly the same.

00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:23.870
You can add several more
tricks, and bells, and whistles.

00:19:23.870 --> 00:19:26.906
And of course, I would
probably emphasize

00:19:26.906 --> 00:19:28.280
that the solution
could either be

00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:31.180
done numerically or you
could use the symmetry

00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:33.430
relations of the
crystal to develop

00:19:33.430 --> 00:19:37.940
a very simple expression
of the crystal,

00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:41.830
minimizing the
redundant directions

00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:43.660
inside of the crystal,
collapsing it down

00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:46.420
into the bare essential
to describe that crystal

00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:47.350
structure.

00:19:47.350 --> 00:19:53.690
And we would have some uniform
energy space that looks,

00:19:53.690 --> 00:19:56.150
for example, represented by
this yellowish surface, where

00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:58.191
you'd have an isopotential
inside of your crystal

00:19:58.191 --> 00:20:00.110
structure.

00:20:00.110 --> 00:20:03.970
So these are different ways of
looking at the band gap inside

00:20:03.970 --> 00:20:05.465
of a semiconductor crystal.

00:20:05.465 --> 00:20:07.840
If you're really interested,
and for the advance reading,

00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:09.673
I would definitely
suggest this book called,

00:20:09.673 --> 00:20:12.750
Fundamentals of Semiconductors,
by Professor Peter Yu,

00:20:12.750 --> 00:20:15.200
now retired at UC Berkeley.

00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:17.280
Very nice explanation.

00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:20.160
Uses an elegant
application of group theory

00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:26.210
to derive the band structure
of a semiconductor in detail.

00:20:26.210 --> 00:20:29.523
So let's hop back to this one,
real quick-- actually, yeah?

00:20:29.523 --> 00:20:30.898
AUDIENCE: I'm just
curious if you

00:20:30.898 --> 00:20:32.906
could tell us the name
of the equation that

00:20:32.906 --> 00:20:34.670
was at the top of--

00:20:34.670 --> 00:20:37.330
PROFESSOR: Sure.

00:20:37.330 --> 00:20:37.980
Absolutely.

00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:42.503
So what we're describing here
is essentially the e to the ikx,

00:20:42.503 --> 00:20:45.440
or e to the ikr,
essentially describing

00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:46.790
that periodic potential.

00:20:46.790 --> 00:20:50.450
And then in essentially
an envelope function.

00:20:50.450 --> 00:20:52.599
So, yeah, that would
be the wave function

00:20:52.599 --> 00:20:54.890
that would be introduced into
the Schrodinger equation.

00:20:58.810 --> 00:21:00.850
So let's go back to
here really quickly,

00:21:00.850 --> 00:21:03.590
because I don't want to
get us lost in the weeds.

00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:06.930
I want us to focus on the
main concepts at hand.

00:21:06.930 --> 00:21:09.740
Let's, from an engineering
point of view--

00:21:09.740 --> 00:21:14.470
given this formation of bands
inside of real materials,

00:21:14.470 --> 00:21:17.300
since the atoms are coming
together and forming crystals,

00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:20.830
we can envision a few
different scenarios.

00:21:20.830 --> 00:21:22.520
Let's focus on the
this band here,

00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:25.200
and that band here, and the
space in between them, the band

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:25.740
gap.

00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:27.880
And let's assume that
we have this band

00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:30.300
here either completely
filled or partially filled,

00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:32.530
and talk about what
happens in three

00:21:32.530 --> 00:21:35.170
different extreme scenarios.

00:21:35.170 --> 00:21:38.300
In one case, when we have
the band partially filled,

00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:40.850
we have what is
known as a metal.

00:21:40.850 --> 00:21:42.640
And the reason this
case is interesting

00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:45.130
is because a very
small amount of energy

00:21:45.130 --> 00:21:48.530
is all that it would take
to excite an electron

00:21:48.530 --> 00:21:50.480
and make it to move
around the crystal.

00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:52.105
As a matter of fact,
a metal has what's

00:21:52.105 --> 00:21:56.040
called electron c, that
serves to conduct electricity

00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:59.100
at room temperature and
even at very, very, very

00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:00.900
low temperatures.

00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:02.670
Semiconductor, on
the other hand.

00:22:02.670 --> 00:22:04.964
Now semiconductor has
a finite band gap,

00:22:04.964 --> 00:22:06.380
and we'll get to
this in a minute.

00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:08.296
Let's start with the
insulator, because that's

00:22:08.296 --> 00:22:10.680
a more easy to understand case.

00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:14.240
If the band gap is
very, very, very big,

00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:16.730
then a large amount
of energy is required

00:22:16.730 --> 00:22:19.780
to excite an electron
into an unbound state,

00:22:19.780 --> 00:22:21.780
so it can move freely
across the crystal.

00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:23.560
And as a result,
you're not going

00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:26.220
to have a very large population
of electrons up here.

00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:28.380
The photo excited
carrier population,

00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:32.930
meaning the population of
charge carriers, electrons,

00:22:32.930 --> 00:22:35.960
that are excited into here
from light, is very small.

00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:37.990
And the thermally excited
carrier concentration,

00:22:37.990 --> 00:22:39.490
just some background
thermal energy,

00:22:39.490 --> 00:22:42.520
kt, Boltzmann's constant
times temperature,

00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:45.450
that energy is also going to be
insufficient to drive electrons

00:22:45.450 --> 00:22:46.520
across this band gap.

00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:49.370
And as a result, you will have
a very, very small population

00:22:49.370 --> 00:22:52.780
of carriers up here.

00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:55.760
And this will be an
insulator, because you

00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:59.540
will have very few charges
to transport current.

00:22:59.540 --> 00:23:02.170
If you apply a potential
across an insulator,

00:23:02.170 --> 00:23:04.380
you will not have very
much current flow.

00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:06.790
And that's the principle
of insulating materials

00:23:06.790 --> 00:23:08.260
around wires.

00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:10.020
Actually this is in
the semiconductor.

00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:11.290
This is a polymer.

00:23:11.290 --> 00:23:14.360
But if we had, for
example, glass or diamond,

00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:18.330
that would serve as a
nice insulator as well.

00:23:18.330 --> 00:23:20.960
Now a semiconductor material
is somewhere between a metal

00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:22.180
and an insulator here.

00:23:22.180 --> 00:23:24.610
And that the band
gap is now shrinking.

00:23:24.610 --> 00:23:27.280
The band gap is small enough
to interact with lights,

00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:28.211
typically.

00:23:28.211 --> 00:23:29.960
For example, this
little piece of silicon,

00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:31.900
which I'll show in
detail in a minute,

00:23:31.900 --> 00:23:33.330
towards the end of class.

00:23:33.330 --> 00:23:35.500
It doesn't look clear,
like glass does.

00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:37.310
It looks opaque.

00:23:37.310 --> 00:23:39.090
And that's because
it's absorbing photons

00:23:39.090 --> 00:23:41.220
in the visible spectrum.

00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:43.720
But it's letting some of the
infrared photons go through it.

00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:45.178
Some of the very
low energy photons

00:23:45.178 --> 00:23:47.280
can go through the material,
because those photons

00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:49.470
have insufficient energy
to excite carriers

00:23:49.470 --> 00:23:51.830
across that band gap.

00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:55.220
So we have a semiconductor
material, defined here

00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:57.130
as having a band gap.

00:23:57.130 --> 00:24:00.100
That band gap defines the
energy of the light that

00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:01.700
is most efficiently absorbed.

00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:04.814
And any photon with energy
in excess of the band gap

00:24:04.814 --> 00:24:06.605
can also be absorbed
by that semiconductor.

00:24:09.610 --> 00:24:12.612
Any questions so far?

00:24:12.612 --> 00:24:15.027
AUDIENCE: Are there
any natural materials

00:24:15.027 --> 00:24:17.721
where the spacing
of the bands is such

00:24:17.721 --> 00:24:20.179
that three bands are active,
or is it always just two bands

00:24:20.179 --> 00:24:20.840
which are active?

00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:21.798
PROFESSOR: Interesting.

00:24:21.798 --> 00:24:24.250
So the question is, are
there more bands above here

00:24:24.250 --> 00:24:26.300
that you could excite into?

00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:28.090
Absolutely.

00:24:28.090 --> 00:24:32.740
So as you can envision,
back here for instance,

00:24:32.740 --> 00:24:35.710
you could continue drawing
more and more and more bands.

00:24:35.710 --> 00:24:37.750
They're unoccupied,
but they exist.

00:24:37.750 --> 00:24:40.280
And as the atoms come
closer and closer together,

00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:42.120
those begin interacting as well.

00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:44.610
And so in a few
lectures we'll look

00:24:44.610 --> 00:24:46.600
at a band diagram
of a semiconductor,

00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:48.310
and we'll see all
the occupied bands,

00:24:48.310 --> 00:24:49.886
and all the unoccupied bands.

00:24:49.886 --> 00:24:51.510
And you can excite
into any one of them

00:24:51.510 --> 00:24:55.000
if you have the right
excitation condition.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.750
Let's put it that way.

00:24:57.750 --> 00:24:59.400
Any other questions?

00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:00.059
Yeah.

00:25:00.059 --> 00:25:02.100
AUDIENCE: I'm having
trouble seeing the chemist's

00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:04.237
description along
with the physicist's

00:25:04.237 --> 00:25:07.688
description along with
this slide all together.

00:25:07.688 --> 00:25:10.646
How does, once it's in
the crystal structure

00:25:10.646 --> 00:25:13.111
and it's in its
lattices and everything,

00:25:13.111 --> 00:25:15.320
how does that look
in this picture?

00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:16.570
Where is that in this picture.

00:25:16.570 --> 00:25:17.236
PROFESSOR: Sure.

00:25:17.236 --> 00:25:19.680
So this one here, let
me describe the axes,

00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:22.300
because that might make things
a little easier to understand.

00:25:22.300 --> 00:25:25.480
In the vertical axis
here, we have energy.

00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:29.000
And that's the same axis as
we have right here, energy.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.389
In this axis right here, we
had inter atomic separation.

00:25:31.389 --> 00:25:32.930
So this was meant
to demonstrate what

00:25:32.930 --> 00:25:35.730
happens when we bring atoms
closer and close together.

00:25:35.730 --> 00:25:37.550
In this description
right here, this

00:25:37.550 --> 00:25:41.850
is an unlabeled axis that could
be x real space, for instance.

00:25:41.850 --> 00:25:45.707
Why do we plot an
x in the x-axis?

00:25:45.707 --> 00:25:46.790
Why do we plot real space?

00:25:46.790 --> 00:25:49.262
Well sometimes, when we talk
about solar cell devices,

00:25:49.262 --> 00:25:50.720
we're talking about
bringing charge

00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:52.970
from deep within the device
to the front surface where

00:25:52.970 --> 00:25:54.070
the contact is.

00:25:54.070 --> 00:25:57.240
And so we want to talk about the
flow of charge in real space.

00:25:57.240 --> 00:26:00.010
So that's oftentimes why
you see in these band

00:26:00.010 --> 00:26:02.060
diagrams for solar
cells, you'll see

00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:05.350
e versus x, versus real space.

00:26:05.350 --> 00:26:08.330
Now let me show you what these
two levels here represent.

00:26:08.330 --> 00:26:11.040
This is the top
of the filled band

00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:13.150
and the bottom of
the empty band.

00:26:13.150 --> 00:26:15.010
And those correspond over here.

00:26:15.010 --> 00:26:16.830
I'm going to use the
mouse now, because I'm

00:26:16.830 --> 00:26:17.930
going to be stretching.

00:26:17.930 --> 00:26:22.730
Let's imagine that this
level on down was filled.

00:26:22.730 --> 00:26:24.840
And that this level
up here is empty.

00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:28.980
So if I may, these
are all filled.

00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:29.890
All filled.

00:26:29.890 --> 00:26:33.620
And this one here is empty.

00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:35.070
Gonna take a little bit.

00:26:35.070 --> 00:26:35.720
Here we go.

00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:36.220
All right.

00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:40.030
So now this band is going to
be filled, because we're really

00:26:40.030 --> 00:26:43.820
looking at the equilibrium inter
atomic separation in a crystal.

00:26:43.820 --> 00:26:45.990
We're looking right here this d.

00:26:45.990 --> 00:26:48.182
That's the spacing right
now of those atoms inside

00:26:48.182 --> 00:26:50.140
of that piece of
semiconductor material, inside

00:26:50.140 --> 00:26:51.210
of that silicon.

00:26:51.210 --> 00:26:56.960
So what we care about
is this right here.

00:26:56.960 --> 00:27:00.320
And this would be the
top of the filled band,

00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:03.170
and this would be the
bottom of the empty band,

00:27:03.170 --> 00:27:08.310
corresponding to the top of
the filled band right here

00:27:08.310 --> 00:27:11.830
and the bottom of the
empty band right there.

00:27:11.830 --> 00:27:13.940
So that's how it
all fits together.

00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:16.700
This diagram here can
get kind of confusing

00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:19.740
when you're looking in
the abscissa, essentially

00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:20.780
the x-axis.

00:27:20.780 --> 00:27:22.892
Because you're thinking
in terms of real space.

00:27:22.892 --> 00:27:25.350
Well, it is real space, but
you're bringing atoms together.

00:27:25.350 --> 00:27:27.433
So it's really meant to
be a phenomenological tool

00:27:27.433 --> 00:27:29.610
to describe how band gaps form.

00:27:29.610 --> 00:27:32.267
This diagram over
here, we're now

00:27:32.267 --> 00:27:34.350
starting to get into the
engineering diagrams that

00:27:34.350 --> 00:27:36.930
can help explain how
solar cells work.

00:27:36.930 --> 00:27:41.550
And from here on out, we'll
be abandoning that chemists

00:27:41.550 --> 00:27:43.960
diagram and simply
using this one

00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:46.950
because we assume that we're not
applying a significant strain

00:27:46.950 --> 00:27:50.360
to our semiconductor
material to get

00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:51.530
significant deviations here.

00:27:51.530 --> 00:27:54.520
We'd have to apply strains
of several percent,

00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:56.830
and probably result in
fracture of our semiconductor

00:27:56.830 --> 00:28:01.850
before we ended up changing
that inter-atomic distance.

00:28:01.850 --> 00:28:03.629
We could also heat it up.

00:28:03.629 --> 00:28:05.920
It's another way of introducing
strain, thermal strain,

00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:09.470
but not mechanical.

00:28:09.470 --> 00:28:09.970
OK.

00:28:09.970 --> 00:28:12.850
So did that help
answer the question?

00:28:12.850 --> 00:28:13.350
OK.

00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:18.390
So the second
point here, we want

00:28:18.390 --> 00:28:20.630
to first off describe
phenomenological band gap

00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:22.950
and understand how that works.

00:28:22.950 --> 00:28:25.180
Secondly, we want to
describe optical transitions

00:28:25.180 --> 00:28:28.490
in the semiconductor and
understand how charge carriers,

00:28:28.490 --> 00:28:31.430
in other words, how electrons
on an energy band diagram

00:28:31.430 --> 00:28:32.540
are moving around.

00:28:32.540 --> 00:28:35.280
Why do we call electrons
charge carriers once again?

00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:36.780
Remind me, from
this diagram here.

00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:44.020
Exactly.

00:28:44.020 --> 00:28:44.767
It's brilliant.

00:28:44.767 --> 00:28:46.850
I just want to make sure
that those two things are

00:28:46.850 --> 00:28:48.600
synonymous in people's
minds, that we're not getting

00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:50.080
caught up on the language.

00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:50.770
Thank you.

00:28:50.770 --> 00:28:53.040
So again, charge
carriers, electrons,

00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:56.130
being free electrons, unbound
electrons, not any electron,

00:28:56.130 --> 00:28:58.740
not the ones down here, but
the ones that are excited.

00:28:58.740 --> 00:29:04.340
OK, so let's go back to lecture
number two, I think it was,

00:29:04.340 --> 00:29:07.480
where we talk about
the duality of light.

00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:09.764
It's a wave and a particle.

00:29:09.764 --> 00:29:12.180
Well it can be thought of, can
be described mathematically

00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:13.138
as waves and particles.

00:29:13.138 --> 00:29:14.910
We've, in last
lecture, when we talked

00:29:14.910 --> 00:29:17.990
about lights and the interaction
with lights with materials,

00:29:17.990 --> 00:29:20.480
we referred to light
mostly as a wave.

00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:24.510
This was very easy for us
to describe interference.

00:29:24.510 --> 00:29:27.380
It made it convenient to
do the homework problems,

00:29:27.380 --> 00:29:30.170
especially for the graduate
students, the last problem.

00:29:30.170 --> 00:29:31.350
That was a lot of fun

00:29:31.350 --> 00:29:33.460
But now we will be
talking about life

00:29:33.460 --> 00:29:36.050
in terms of discrete
quanta of energy,

00:29:36.050 --> 00:29:37.870
because one photon
is going to be

00:29:37.870 --> 00:29:40.060
absorbed by an electron,
an excited electron,

00:29:40.060 --> 00:29:41.560
into another state.

00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:45.340
So now we think of the photon
as having a certain energy,

00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:48.140
defined by the
wavelength of light,

00:29:48.140 --> 00:29:51.900
and that energy is going to be
given to the electron, which

00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:55.254
will then be excited inside
of our semiconductor crystal.

00:29:55.254 --> 00:29:55.920
So what happens?

00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:57.316
Well we have our sun.

00:29:57.316 --> 00:29:58.940
Here we have our
semiconductor crystal.

00:29:58.940 --> 00:30:02.780
Again, I'm representing
it in terms of e versus x.

00:30:02.780 --> 00:30:05.630
I'm saying that these
states here are filled.

00:30:05.630 --> 00:30:07.970
And these states here
are mostly empty.

00:30:07.970 --> 00:30:09.200
And these are mostly filled.

00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:11.050
Mostly empty.

00:30:11.050 --> 00:30:13.230
And this is my band
gap right here.

00:30:13.230 --> 00:30:17.410
I'm plotting e in the
ordinate and x real space

00:30:17.410 --> 00:30:18.520
in the abscissa.

00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:20.589
And again, x because,
ultimately, we'll

00:30:20.589 --> 00:30:22.630
be looking at the cross
section of the solar cell

00:30:22.630 --> 00:30:25.570
in x, in describing how charge
gets extracted from the device.

00:30:25.570 --> 00:30:28.210
So that's why we're going
to be using x on this axis.

00:30:28.210 --> 00:30:30.510
Now we have sunlight here,
outside of our device.

00:30:30.510 --> 00:30:32.050
And it's going to
be shining light

00:30:32.050 --> 00:30:34.400
onto the semiconductor crystal.

00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:35.280
So what happens?

00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:36.859
Well, we know
intuitively that charge

00:30:36.859 --> 00:30:38.400
should be excited
from a bound states

00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:41.750
to an unbound state, where it
can move around the material.

00:30:41.750 --> 00:30:44.870
But not all light
serves this function.

00:30:44.870 --> 00:30:48.970
If we have a photon that has
an energy above the band gap

00:30:48.970 --> 00:30:53.110
energy, so e photon, meaning the
energy of the incident photon

00:30:53.110 --> 00:30:56.040
is greater than e gap, the
energy band gap, then we'll

00:30:56.040 --> 00:30:57.350
have an excitation of charge.

00:30:57.350 --> 00:31:00.670
We'll have an electron taken
from somewhere here, brought up

00:31:00.670 --> 00:31:03.060
to a higher excited
states, and it

00:31:03.060 --> 00:31:06.690
might come to settle down at the
bottom of that band of states

00:31:06.690 --> 00:31:07.730
that is allowed.

00:31:07.730 --> 00:31:10.510
A settling, if you will.

00:31:10.510 --> 00:31:14.270
But if our photon energy
is less than our band gap,

00:31:14.270 --> 00:31:15.730
we won't have this
process occur.

00:31:15.730 --> 00:31:19.450
Instead we'll have the light
going straight through it.

00:31:19.450 --> 00:31:21.720
And this is
brilliant, because you

00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:24.400
can begin to understand
the behavior of many solids

00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:25.370
in this way.

00:31:25.370 --> 00:31:26.811
Let's take a glass,
for instance.

00:31:26.811 --> 00:31:29.060
How many you have noticed
that you never get sunburned

00:31:29.060 --> 00:31:30.810
when the windows are up?

00:31:30.810 --> 00:31:33.990
But you get sunburned when you
forget to put the windows up,

00:31:33.990 --> 00:31:36.820
when you're driving around
and your arm's sticking out,

00:31:36.820 --> 00:31:38.850
you get that nice truckers tan.

00:31:38.850 --> 00:31:42.270
That's because the ultraviolet
photons have enough energy

00:31:42.270 --> 00:31:45.360
in glass to excite electrons
across the band gap.

00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:47.730
So the ultraviolet photons
gets absorbed by the glass,

00:31:47.730 --> 00:31:51.250
but the visible photons instead
are coming straight through,

00:31:51.250 --> 00:31:53.080
much like this.

00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:55.710
Now glass has a
very large band gap.

00:31:55.710 --> 00:31:58.610
Now silicon, much
smaller band gap.

00:31:58.610 --> 00:32:01.940
And in that case, in
the case of silicon,

00:32:01.940 --> 00:32:03.190
even the visible gets blocked.

00:32:03.190 --> 00:32:05.600
So silicon would make
a really crummy window.

00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:08.310
But it makes a really
great infrared window.

00:32:08.310 --> 00:32:10.050
So if you're detecting
infrared light,

00:32:10.050 --> 00:32:11.650
and want to block
out all the visible,

00:32:11.650 --> 00:32:15.310
you might consider sticking
up a filter made of silicon.

00:32:15.310 --> 00:32:18.064
And that's regularly
done in laboratories.

00:32:18.064 --> 00:32:19.480
So you can begin
to understand how

00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:22.350
light interacts with
matter, with solids,

00:32:22.350 --> 00:32:24.280
using this energy band diagram.

00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:27.810
And ultimately how these
optical absorption spectra

00:32:27.810 --> 00:32:29.360
come into being.

00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:31.580
So we studied these
optical absorption spectra

00:32:31.580 --> 00:32:32.330
in our last class.

00:32:32.330 --> 00:32:34.390
We just took them as a given.

00:32:34.390 --> 00:32:37.410
We didn't question
where they came from.

00:32:37.410 --> 00:32:40.890
Now we're going to be focusing
on this so-called turn

00:32:40.890 --> 00:32:43.030
on energy, or turn
on wave length.

00:32:43.030 --> 00:32:45.750
Remember wavelength and
energy are interchangeable.

00:32:45.750 --> 00:32:48.440
I've written down below here
the energy corresponding

00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:50.770
to a given wavelength,
around 2000 nanometers.

00:32:50.770 --> 00:32:53.160
We have an energy
of around 0.62 eV.

00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:58.480
At around 200 nanometers,
we have an energy of 6.2 eV.

00:32:58.480 --> 00:33:02.540
Since one is the reciprocal
of the other, related by hc,

00:33:02.540 --> 00:33:04.200
it's only natural
that if we change one

00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:05.750
by an order of magnitude,
we're changing the other

00:33:05.750 --> 00:33:07.874
by an order of magnitude
in the opposite direction.

00:33:07.874 --> 00:33:10.520
So we're wrapping our minds
around this interchangeability

00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:11.884
of wavelength and energy.

00:33:11.884 --> 00:33:13.300
That's important,
because we'll be

00:33:13.300 --> 00:33:17.440
referring to them very
naturally as a photon

00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:20.030
either having a certain
wavelength or a certain energy.

00:33:20.030 --> 00:33:22.550
You notice that there are
certain turn on energies.

00:33:22.550 --> 00:33:24.610
So energy is increasing
in that direction there.

00:33:24.610 --> 00:33:28.040
So as we go from
infrared to ultraviolet,

00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:30.800
the energy of the incoming
light is increasing.

00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:33.390
And if the energy is too low,
the semiconductor crystal

00:33:33.390 --> 00:33:34.360
just won't absorb.

00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:36.570
The absorptance is 0,
or very, very small.

00:33:36.570 --> 00:33:39.500
It doesn't even appear
on the log plot here.

00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:41.270
And as we begin
increasing the energy,

00:33:41.270 --> 00:33:42.770
suddenly there's like a turn on.

00:33:42.770 --> 00:33:45.500
The semiconductor begins
to absorb that light,

00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:49.450
and you begin to have this
process occur right here.

00:33:49.450 --> 00:33:52.662
You begin to go from
that red light that

00:33:52.662 --> 00:33:54.120
went straight
through the material,

00:33:54.120 --> 00:33:58.742
to this blue light example here
where we have absorption event.

00:33:58.742 --> 00:33:59.822
Yeah?

00:33:59.822 --> 00:34:02.280
AUDIENCE: This is probably a
minor question, but where does

00:34:02.280 --> 00:34:04.488
the energy go-- that it's
released when your electron

00:34:04.488 --> 00:34:06.527
settles back down?

00:34:06.527 --> 00:34:08.110
PROFESSOR: We're
going to get to that.

00:34:08.110 --> 00:34:09.510
We're taking it step by step.

00:34:09.510 --> 00:34:10.909
That's a really good question.

00:34:10.909 --> 00:34:13.139
You're one step ahead of me.

00:34:13.139 --> 00:34:16.060
We're going to be describing the
actual shape and character up

00:34:16.060 --> 00:34:18.210
here, because this
is really equally

00:34:18.210 --> 00:34:20.770
important for the functioning
of a solar cell device,

00:34:20.770 --> 00:34:22.166
over the next few lectures.

00:34:22.166 --> 00:34:23.540
But that gets
really complicated.

00:34:23.540 --> 00:34:26.326
So for now, we're going to just
focus on this turn on energy.

00:34:26.326 --> 00:34:28.409
And we're going to make
some assumptions from here

00:34:28.409 --> 00:34:30.500
on out that the
semiconductor doesn't absorb,

00:34:30.500 --> 00:34:35.250
and all of a sudden it absorbs,
and the absorption goes high.

00:34:35.250 --> 00:34:37.612
It begins absorbing
all of our light,

00:34:37.612 --> 00:34:39.320
for purposes of our
homework assignments.

00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:43.730
So again, just to put this
all into one big picture,

00:34:43.730 --> 00:34:48.121
so far we have the case out
here where very little light is

00:34:48.121 --> 00:34:49.370
absorbed by our semiconductor.

00:34:49.370 --> 00:34:52.100
We have the case of glass, light
coming straight through it,

00:34:52.100 --> 00:34:53.350
visible light rather.

00:34:53.350 --> 00:34:55.219
Because the incident
photon energy

00:34:55.219 --> 00:34:57.600
is less than the band gap,
there is insufficient energy

00:34:57.600 --> 00:34:59.360
to excite into the
conduction band.

00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:03.660
Now as we transition
from a photon energy

00:35:03.660 --> 00:35:06.160
less than the band gap to photon
energy larger than the band

00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:09.060
gap, we can begin exciting
electrons or charges

00:35:09.060 --> 00:35:10.690
across the band
gap, and that's why

00:35:10.690 --> 00:35:16.080
we get absorption inside of
our semiconductor materials.

00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:17.200
Any questions so far?

00:35:20.460 --> 00:35:21.760
OK.

00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:22.260
Good.

00:35:22.260 --> 00:35:25.120
Everybody's still with me.

00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:28.440
We're going to now calculate
the fraction of photons lost,

00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:30.200
not absorbed by a
semiconductor material

00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:33.230
with a given band gap,
thickness, and reflectivity.

00:35:33.230 --> 00:35:36.620
And this gets to Ashley's
question right here.

00:35:36.620 --> 00:35:39.480
So again, we ran through a
thickness estimate in class

00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:40.540
the last time.

00:35:40.540 --> 00:35:42.325
And we assumed for
a semiconductor,

00:35:42.325 --> 00:35:44.320
I think it was around
800 nanometers.

00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:46.800
For gallium,
arsenide, and silicon.

00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:49.510
Or maybe it was a little
less, somewhere around 550.

00:35:49.510 --> 00:35:53.090
What was the thickness necessary
to absorb say 90% of the light

00:35:53.090 --> 00:35:54.490
at a given wavelength?

00:35:54.490 --> 00:35:56.170
And we, in the
back of our minds,

00:35:56.170 --> 00:36:00.110
have the solar spectrum
here as a reference point

00:36:00.110 --> 00:36:02.860
to begin visualizing
the number of photons

00:36:02.860 --> 00:36:06.050
that occur within each of these
delta wavelengths down here.

00:36:06.050 --> 00:36:08.420
Essentially what portions of
the spectrum really matter?

00:36:08.420 --> 00:36:10.670
Obviously you're not going
to optimize your solar cell

00:36:10.670 --> 00:36:13.450
to absorb light way out here,
because there's really not

00:36:13.450 --> 00:36:15.340
too much of the solar
spectrum way out there.

00:36:15.340 --> 00:36:16.480
You're probably
going to optimize it

00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:18.790
somewhere around the peak
of the solar spectrum,

00:36:18.790 --> 00:36:20.200
somewhere near there.

00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:22.450
So we walked through
that in the last class.

00:36:22.450 --> 00:36:25.590
I want to have that in your
ram as we move forward.

00:36:25.590 --> 00:36:27.920
We want to calculate
the fraction

00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:30.860
of incident solar energy
lost to this thing called

00:36:30.860 --> 00:36:33.240
thermalization that Ashley
was mentioning before.

00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:36.140
We have, in this simplified
diagram right here,

00:36:36.140 --> 00:36:38.750
an electron popping up
to a higher energy level

00:36:38.750 --> 00:36:42.967
and then settling down to the
bottom of this conduction band,

00:36:42.967 --> 00:36:44.800
we call it, this band
of states that's empty

00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:46.410
right here, or largely empty.

00:36:46.410 --> 00:36:48.530
And this settling
down to the bottom

00:36:48.530 --> 00:36:51.780
of what is this mostly
empty band of states

00:36:51.780 --> 00:36:54.450
is a process called
thermalization.

00:36:54.450 --> 00:36:57.000
And it occurs,
well, because there

00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:59.580
are a series of states the
electron can very easily move

00:36:59.580 --> 00:37:02.830
between them by emitting
phonons, or lattice vibrations,

00:37:02.830 --> 00:37:03.900
or heat.

00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:06.200
And very quickly that
electron will settle down

00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:09.030
into what is called or referred
to as the conduction band

00:37:09.030 --> 00:37:12.190
minimum, the minimum energy
level within the conduction

00:37:12.190 --> 00:37:13.390
band.

00:37:13.390 --> 00:37:15.510
And this little arrow
shown in red right

00:37:15.510 --> 00:37:19.820
here has a component in the
y-axis, in e space here,

00:37:19.820 --> 00:37:21.850
which is a finite energy.

00:37:21.850 --> 00:37:23.480
We can quantify that.

00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:25.260
That thermalization
loss right there

00:37:25.260 --> 00:37:27.620
is the difference
between this energy level

00:37:27.620 --> 00:37:30.160
and that energy level
of the electron.

00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:34.210
And so that's the
thermalization loss.

00:37:34.210 --> 00:37:37.070
That is another type of loss
of a semiconductor crystal.

00:37:37.070 --> 00:37:38.590
So we've discussed two so far.

00:37:38.590 --> 00:37:40.332
We've discussed
non-absorption of light.

00:37:40.332 --> 00:37:42.540
There are certain long
wavelengths, low energy light,

00:37:42.540 --> 00:37:43.950
that go straight to our
material and doesn't

00:37:43.950 --> 00:37:46.491
get absorbed, because the photon
energy is less than the band

00:37:46.491 --> 00:37:47.100
gap.

00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:49.180
And the second
major loss mechanism

00:37:49.180 --> 00:37:51.960
is when we have too much
energy of the incoming photon,

00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:54.340
we have an excitation
of a bound electron

00:37:54.340 --> 00:37:56.670
into a very highly
unbound state,

00:37:56.670 --> 00:38:00.890
and then a quick loss of that
excess energy due to a process

00:38:00.890 --> 00:38:03.490
called thermalization.

00:38:03.490 --> 00:38:05.791
Any questions so far?

00:38:05.791 --> 00:38:07.739
AUDIENCE: You said that
the thermalization can

00:38:07.739 --> 00:38:11.640
result in heat being
released or phonons--

00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:12.540
PROFESSOR: Mh-hmm.

00:38:12.540 --> 00:38:14.120
Yeah.

00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:20.210
So not the prime energy that
we extract from the solar cell

00:38:20.210 --> 00:38:22.150
of electricity.

00:38:22.150 --> 00:38:24.410
In principle, if you could
develop some clever way

00:38:24.410 --> 00:38:26.780
of extracting heat,
perhaps by slapping

00:38:26.780 --> 00:38:29.430
on a thermoelectric device in
the back of your solar cell,

00:38:29.430 --> 00:38:31.320
then you could extract
that energy as well.

00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:33.680
So there's a potential
to recover that heat.

00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:37.357
It's not total loss, but from
a mechanical engineering point

00:38:37.357 --> 00:38:39.690
of view, if you think about
the thermodynamic efficiency

00:38:39.690 --> 00:38:43.400
of a Carnot engine, where
your t high is this,

00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:45.320
and your t low is your
ambient temperature,

00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:47.511
that delta really
doesn't look that good.

00:38:47.511 --> 00:38:48.010
Yeah.

00:38:48.010 --> 00:38:48.807
It's really tiny.

00:38:48.807 --> 00:38:51.140
So you have to think of a
more clever mechanism, perhaps

00:38:51.140 --> 00:38:53.473
through a thermoelectric
device, or some other mechanism

00:38:53.473 --> 00:38:56.800
to extract that extra
thermalization loss.

00:38:56.800 --> 00:38:59.070
I wanted to-- so
what we're doing

00:38:59.070 --> 00:39:01.140
is we're taking the
simplest picture,

00:39:01.140 --> 00:39:02.920
and then adding
layers of complexity.

00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:05.030
And you'll hear me
stumbling over my language,

00:39:05.030 --> 00:39:07.520
as I sanitize it in
my head, to remove

00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:11.430
all of the complex techno lingo,
and reduce it to its essence.

00:39:11.430 --> 00:39:13.180
And so right now I'm
going to add one more

00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:14.720
layer of complexity,
and ultimately

00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:18.160
build up to the point where
I can feel conversant again.

00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:20.605
We have incoming light,
not exciting the electron

00:39:20.605 --> 00:39:22.980
all the way up to there from
the top of the valence band,

00:39:22.980 --> 00:39:25.280
but typically somewhere
within the valence band.

00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:28.500
Not really at the valence band
maximum or the maximum energy

00:39:28.500 --> 00:39:32.150
level within the valence band,
these being the filled states.

00:39:32.150 --> 00:39:34.850
So this is a more
realistic representation

00:39:34.850 --> 00:39:35.910
of charge excitation.

00:39:35.910 --> 00:39:38.680
We have an electron
being excited up.

00:39:38.680 --> 00:39:41.400
And this little h plus that's
right here, who did the reading

00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:43.840
and know what that
h plus represents?

00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:44.900
A hole.

00:39:44.900 --> 00:39:46.520
So what is a hole?

00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:47.990
It's just what it sounds like.

00:39:47.990 --> 00:39:49.879
It's the absence of an electron.

00:39:49.879 --> 00:39:51.170
There used to be electron here.

00:39:51.170 --> 00:39:51.940
Now it's up there.

00:39:51.940 --> 00:39:53.640
It left behind a hole.

00:39:53.640 --> 00:39:55.210
An easy way to
think about a hole

00:39:55.210 --> 00:39:59.970
is if you're in a big traffic
jam, bumper to bumper,

00:39:59.970 --> 00:40:04.510
something bad happened up ahead,
and backed up the traffic.

00:40:04.510 --> 00:40:08.520
Now imagine just removing
one car from that highway.

00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:10.100
You've created a hole.

00:40:10.100 --> 00:40:15.574
So the car that used to be
behind that hole moves forward.

00:40:15.574 --> 00:40:17.990
And the car that used to be
behind that one moves forward.

00:40:17.990 --> 00:40:20.406
And the car that used to be
behind that one moves forward.

00:40:20.406 --> 00:40:21.680
So three cars moved forward.

00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:25.420
And the hole moved
backward three places.

00:40:25.420 --> 00:40:25.920
Right.

00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:28.610
So you can either describe
the dynamics of the system

00:40:28.610 --> 00:40:30.870
as n number of
cars moving forward

00:40:30.870 --> 00:40:34.780
or one hole moving
backwards n places.

00:40:34.780 --> 00:40:38.130
It's much simpler from an
accountability point of view

00:40:38.130 --> 00:40:41.070
to be talking about one
quasi particle, a hole,

00:40:41.070 --> 00:40:43.070
rather than talking about
n cars moving forward,

00:40:43.070 --> 00:40:44.260
n electrons moving.

00:40:44.260 --> 00:40:46.760
So when we talk about
this hole right here,

00:40:46.760 --> 00:40:50.790
thermalization is going
to drive this electron

00:40:50.790 --> 00:40:54.210
to the lowest energy level
within the conduction band.

00:40:54.210 --> 00:40:56.690
And it's also going to drive
the electrons above the hole,

00:40:56.690 --> 00:40:58.387
essentially to fall
down into the hole.

00:40:58.387 --> 00:41:00.220
In other words, the
hole is going to move up

00:41:00.220 --> 00:41:02.080
to the top of the valence band.

00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:02.580
Yes.

00:41:02.580 --> 00:41:03.520
Question.

00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:05.478
AUDIENCE: Why isn't the
hole originally created

00:41:05.478 --> 00:41:07.120
at the top of the band?

00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:10.912
PROFESSOR: Well,
it really depends

00:41:10.912 --> 00:41:13.120
on what's called the matrix
element of the absorption

00:41:13.120 --> 00:41:13.659
process.

00:41:13.659 --> 00:41:15.950
In other words, what electrons
have the largest capture

00:41:15.950 --> 00:41:18.104
cross section for
that incident photon.

00:41:18.104 --> 00:41:20.020
And it is a probability
distribution function.

00:41:20.020 --> 00:41:23.980
So you will get some
electrons further down

00:41:23.980 --> 00:41:27.281
from the top of the valence
band absorbing light, as well

00:41:27.281 --> 00:41:28.780
as some of the
electrons right there

00:41:28.780 --> 00:41:31.570
at the tippy top of the
valence band absorbing light.

00:41:31.570 --> 00:41:34.440
So I'm representing, say
for example, a typical case,

00:41:34.440 --> 00:41:36.500
where you have an
electron that's

00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:39.880
not right at the top of the
valence band, and certainly not

00:41:39.880 --> 00:41:42.410
deep in the core level,
but nearish enough

00:41:42.410 --> 00:41:45.830
to the top of the valence band
absorbing that light being

00:41:45.830 --> 00:41:47.380
excited across.

00:41:47.380 --> 00:41:49.930
So in reality,
this is meant to be

00:41:49.930 --> 00:41:52.320
an arbitrary scale here,
but more representative

00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:54.110
of a whole process.

00:41:54.110 --> 00:41:56.970
And to think about this in
a more realistic sense, what

00:41:56.970 --> 00:42:01.514
you would do is you think,
OK, I've this incoming photon,

00:42:01.514 --> 00:42:03.430
and there's a certain
probability distribution

00:42:03.430 --> 00:42:06.710
function that represents the
probability of absorptance

00:42:06.710 --> 00:42:08.650
by different electrons
in my system.

00:42:08.650 --> 00:42:11.380
Which one is going to absorb
the light, let's roll the dice.

00:42:11.380 --> 00:42:12.089
Do a Monte Carlo.

00:42:12.089 --> 00:42:12.588
OK.

00:42:12.588 --> 00:42:13.990
That one absorbed it this time.

00:42:13.990 --> 00:42:15.270
That one got excited up.

00:42:15.270 --> 00:42:15.460
OK.

00:42:15.460 --> 00:42:17.418
Another photon with
identical energy coming in.

00:42:17.418 --> 00:42:18.580
Which electron absorbs it?

00:42:18.580 --> 00:42:20.060
That one.

00:42:20.060 --> 00:42:22.730
So that's the way I would
say it really works.

00:42:22.730 --> 00:42:27.590
This is a simple representation
on the lecture slide.

00:42:27.590 --> 00:42:31.590
So we have the hole going up,
and the electron going down.

00:42:31.590 --> 00:42:34.060
Both particles are relaxing.

00:42:34.060 --> 00:42:34.560
Right.

00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:37.010
So the electron is moving
to its lowest energy state

00:42:37.010 --> 00:42:40.930
and the hole is also moving
to its lowest energy state.

00:42:40.930 --> 00:42:44.160
So if you want to think about
the electron as a bowling ball,

00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:47.140
and the hole as a balloon,
you're welcome to.

00:42:47.140 --> 00:42:51.380
Whatever mechanism helps you
think through this process,

00:42:51.380 --> 00:42:54.520
use that as a crutch right
now as we move forward.

00:42:54.520 --> 00:42:56.080
Always remember
that in the system,

00:42:56.080 --> 00:42:58.120
these are electrons essentially
moving down, and filling up

00:42:58.120 --> 00:42:59.495
that hole, and
the hole is moving

00:42:59.495 --> 00:43:03.040
in the opposite direction, much
like the vacancy in a traffic

00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:05.230
jam.

00:43:05.230 --> 00:43:07.890
So again, thermalization
losses can

00:43:07.890 --> 00:43:10.700
be described by both electrons
and holes in our system,

00:43:10.700 --> 00:43:17.040
by both the rattling around of
an electron in the conduction

00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:19.370
band and the
settling of electrons

00:43:19.370 --> 00:43:20.790
here in the valence
band as well,

00:43:20.790 --> 00:43:23.840
or the rising of that hole
toward the valence band

00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:26.500
maximum and the settling of that
electron toward the conduction

00:43:26.500 --> 00:43:27.940
band minimum.

00:43:27.940 --> 00:43:31.400
So a natural question is,
how fast is this process?

00:43:31.400 --> 00:43:32.260
Can it be reversed?

00:43:32.260 --> 00:43:34.510
If we're losing all this
energy due to thermalization,

00:43:34.510 --> 00:43:38.790
can somehow we halt it and
stop it from happening?

00:43:38.790 --> 00:43:40.820
There are people trying.

00:43:40.820 --> 00:43:42.880
It is a valiant fight.

00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:46.550
This plot right here
represents what's

00:43:46.550 --> 00:43:49.665
called the density of states.

00:43:49.665 --> 00:43:51.790
We're going to get to that
in another lecture here,

00:43:51.790 --> 00:43:56.000
but I'm going to expose you
to the rough concept here.

00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:57.310
Y-axis is energy.

00:43:57.310 --> 00:43:59.820
So again, we have our
valence band maximum

00:43:59.820 --> 00:44:02.050
and our conduction
band minimum up there.

00:44:02.050 --> 00:44:04.600
X-axis here is
representing time.

00:44:04.600 --> 00:44:07.420
So we're going from the
excitation event, which

00:44:07.420 --> 00:44:09.720
occurs right at t equals zero.

00:44:09.720 --> 00:44:13.230
Zero plus represents what this
is on the positive side, moving

00:44:13.230 --> 00:44:15.230
time forward from
the excitation event,

00:44:15.230 --> 00:44:18.090
so instantaneously after
the execution event.

00:44:18.090 --> 00:44:22.350
We had to the equilibrium
population of holes

00:44:22.350 --> 00:44:25.220
and of electrons inside of
our semiconductor system.

00:44:25.220 --> 00:44:27.660
There weren't absolutely
zero electrons

00:44:27.660 --> 00:44:29.366
in the conduction
band, because of heat.

00:44:29.366 --> 00:44:31.240
There was enough thermal
energy in our system

00:44:31.240 --> 00:44:33.210
to excite some of
those electrons across.

00:44:33.210 --> 00:44:36.210
And that's why we had that small
population of electrons there

00:44:36.210 --> 00:44:38.920
and holes down here, the
holes they left behind.

00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:41.700
Now we had a photon coming
in, high energy photon,

00:44:41.700 --> 00:44:45.190
that excited these
electrons down here up there

00:44:45.190 --> 00:44:46.160
into the valence band.

00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:51.770
Up into here, in
the valence band.

00:44:51.770 --> 00:44:55.440
And over time, this
excited population

00:44:55.440 --> 00:44:59.542
will decay down to the
conduction band minimum

00:44:59.542 --> 00:45:01.750
and valence band maximum,
the electrons and the holes

00:45:01.750 --> 00:45:02.880
respectively.

00:45:02.880 --> 00:45:05.540
And over time, when
I say over time,

00:45:05.540 --> 00:45:09.060
I'm referring to something in
the range of one picosecond, 10

00:45:09.060 --> 00:45:11.090
to the minus 12 seconds.

00:45:11.090 --> 00:45:13.540
That's like that, but faster.

00:45:13.540 --> 00:45:16.605
So we have a quick decay of
these photoexcited carriers,

00:45:16.605 --> 00:45:18.250
and so extraction
of that energy is

00:45:18.250 --> 00:45:20.750
going to be nearly impossible,
unless we do something

00:45:20.750 --> 00:45:22.737
very clever with our
crystal to prevent

00:45:22.737 --> 00:45:23.820
that decay from happening.

00:45:23.820 --> 00:45:26.230
Somehow we suppress
the phonons from being

00:45:26.230 --> 00:45:30.070
emitted at that frequency,
at least, or at that energy.

00:45:30.070 --> 00:45:32.260
So there are a lot of
people, clever people,

00:45:32.260 --> 00:45:35.526
working on this problem and
trying to prevent the decay.

00:45:35.526 --> 00:45:36.900
The next challenge,
of course, is

00:45:36.900 --> 00:45:40.570
extracting those so-called hot
carriers, the excited carriers,

00:45:40.570 --> 00:45:42.502
from your device and
keeping that energy when

00:45:42.502 --> 00:45:43.710
they're going into the metal.

00:45:43.710 --> 00:45:45.210
That's a whole
another can of worms.

00:45:45.210 --> 00:45:49.200
So we have the time
scales of thermalization,

00:45:49.200 --> 00:45:52.040
and this is why, at least
from the perspective

00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:54.840
of your homework, we're going to
treat thermalization losses as

00:45:54.840 --> 00:45:55.800
inevitable.

00:45:55.800 --> 00:45:57.740
As Harvard and MIT
students, I would

00:45:57.740 --> 00:46:00.750
urge you to never consider
anything is inevitable.

00:46:00.750 --> 00:46:02.510
If we understand the
physics well enough,

00:46:02.510 --> 00:46:04.550
we can probably
engineer a solution.

00:46:04.550 --> 00:46:09.140
But for now, let's consider this
a reality, a loss mechanism.

00:46:09.140 --> 00:46:11.530
So if we start putting
things together,

00:46:11.530 --> 00:46:15.374
if we put non absorption, which
we talked about last lecture,

00:46:15.374 --> 00:46:16.790
we actually ran
some calculations,

00:46:16.790 --> 00:46:19.110
back of the envelope, and
we calculated the thickness

00:46:19.110 --> 00:46:23.430
necessary to absorb 90% of the
photons at a given wavelength.

00:46:23.430 --> 00:46:25.390
We also know how to
calculate reflectance off

00:46:25.390 --> 00:46:27.470
of a front surface.

00:46:27.470 --> 00:46:29.890
And so we get this
third point right here.

00:46:29.890 --> 00:46:32.050
We actually got it last class.

00:46:32.050 --> 00:46:35.740
And the fourth point right here,
we intuitively understand now

00:46:35.740 --> 00:46:38.680
that if the photon comes in with
more energy than the band gap,

00:46:38.680 --> 00:46:41.950
that excess energy is going to
be lost due to thermalization.

00:46:41.950 --> 00:46:44.000
So now if we have
the solar spectrum,

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:46.130
and we know the band
gap of a semiconductor,

00:46:46.130 --> 00:46:49.830
we should be able to do a very
cursory plot of the efficiency

00:46:49.830 --> 00:46:54.550
versus band gap, versus energy.

00:46:54.550 --> 00:46:56.580
So again, we have
thermalization losses.

00:46:56.580 --> 00:46:58.150
The band gap is too small.

00:46:58.150 --> 00:47:00.980
And non absorption losses,
if the band gap is too large.

00:47:00.980 --> 00:47:04.640
And let's just do an
absurd thought experiment.

00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:06.460
If we say, OK,
I'm really, really

00:47:06.460 --> 00:47:08.220
scared of thermalization
losses, so I'm

00:47:08.220 --> 00:47:10.679
going to make the biggest band
gap material I possibly can,

00:47:10.679 --> 00:47:12.803
I'm going to have a very
low efficiency in my cell,

00:47:12.803 --> 00:47:14.420
because I'm not
absorbing any light.

00:47:14.420 --> 00:47:17.200
The solar cell will
be transparent.

00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:19.920
If I'm scared of
non-absorption losses,

00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:21.920
I say, OK, I'm going to
make my band gap really,

00:47:21.920 --> 00:47:22.950
really, really tiny.

00:47:22.950 --> 00:47:25.480
I'm going to be losing a
heck of a lot of energy

00:47:25.480 --> 00:47:27.920
due to thermalization,
due to this loss mechanism

00:47:27.920 --> 00:47:28.790
right up here.

00:47:28.790 --> 00:47:30.750
And so there has to
be some happy optimum,

00:47:30.750 --> 00:47:32.360
somewhere between
the two, where we

00:47:32.360 --> 00:47:35.560
have the maximum potential
efficiency of a solar cell

00:47:35.560 --> 00:47:38.680
device, given our
solar spectrum.

00:47:38.680 --> 00:47:41.000
We're going to walk
through that right now.

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:45.480
So approximating non-absorption
losses, very first step.

00:47:45.480 --> 00:47:49.070
What we're going to do, for
our non-absorption losses,

00:47:49.070 --> 00:47:51.220
is run a very
quick approximation

00:47:51.220 --> 00:47:56.550
that any photon
with photon energy

00:47:56.550 --> 00:48:00.340
corresponding to the band gap
energy is going to be absorbed.

00:48:00.340 --> 00:48:05.396
So if our photon has a larger
energy than the band bap,

00:48:05.396 --> 00:48:06.480
it will be absorbed.

00:48:06.480 --> 00:48:08.380
If it has an energy
less than the band gap,

00:48:08.380 --> 00:48:09.670
it will not be absorbed.

00:48:09.670 --> 00:48:11.878
And that's what this plot
right here is representing.

00:48:11.878 --> 00:48:14.620
We have wavelength right
here, longer wavelength,

00:48:14.620 --> 00:48:15.920
lower energy.

00:48:15.920 --> 00:48:17.750
Smaller wavelength,
larger energy.

00:48:17.750 --> 00:48:19.600
And at some point,
we have the turn

00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:22.720
on of absorption of
our device, because we

00:48:22.720 --> 00:48:26.710
have band gap at that energy.

00:48:26.710 --> 00:48:30.720
And the y-axis here,
I've plotted EQE, which

00:48:30.720 --> 00:48:32.902
is External Quantum Efficiency.

00:48:32.902 --> 00:48:35.110
I've coined the term over
here on the left-hand side.

00:48:35.110 --> 00:48:36.980
It's the efficiency
at which free charge

00:48:36.980 --> 00:48:40.690
carriers are generated by an
incident photon on the device.

00:48:40.690 --> 00:48:42.780
So one way to think
about it is if I

00:48:42.780 --> 00:48:46.140
have a EQE of 100%, that means
that for each photon that I

00:48:46.140 --> 00:48:50.040
throw at my solar cell device,
I'm generating and collecting

00:48:50.040 --> 00:48:52.160
one free carrier
from that device.

00:48:52.160 --> 00:48:56.050
One electron hole pair, if
you will, from that device.

00:48:56.050 --> 00:48:58.160
So that's plotted right here.

00:48:58.160 --> 00:48:59.800
That makes intuitive sense.

00:48:59.800 --> 00:49:01.261
This is an approximation though.

00:49:01.261 --> 00:49:03.260
And I wanted to take it
one step further, again,

00:49:03.260 --> 00:49:04.390
planting the flag right here.

00:49:04.390 --> 00:49:05.230
Because we're going
to come back to this,

00:49:05.230 --> 00:49:06.235
we're going to use this.

00:49:06.235 --> 00:49:08.360
But I wanted to go one
level deeper into the trees,

00:49:08.360 --> 00:49:10.900
for everyone else who wants
some more advanced concepts.

00:49:10.900 --> 00:49:14.260
This is the reality of how
quantum efficiency looks.

00:49:14.260 --> 00:49:17.914
Yes, we have a turn on,
depending on the material

00:49:17.914 --> 00:49:18.580
that's involved.

00:49:18.580 --> 00:49:20.970
We have silicon, gallium
arsenide, copper indium gallium

00:49:20.970 --> 00:49:25.362
diselenide, amorphous silicon,
dye sensitized solar cells,

00:49:25.362 --> 00:49:27.820
organic solar cells, a variety
of different materials right

00:49:27.820 --> 00:49:28.540
here.

00:49:28.540 --> 00:49:31.670
And their different turn
on wavelengths right here.

00:49:31.670 --> 00:49:33.630
So we have wavelengths,
different energies.

00:49:33.630 --> 00:49:36.330
Some turn on at lower energies,
others at higher energies.

00:49:36.330 --> 00:49:39.080
So this represents, more
or less, the band gap

00:49:39.080 --> 00:49:40.790
turn on energy, more or less.

00:49:40.790 --> 00:49:42.498
It also has to do with
the thickness, how

00:49:42.498 --> 00:49:43.700
it absorbs light.

00:49:43.700 --> 00:49:46.050
At the shorter
wavelengths though,

00:49:46.050 --> 00:49:48.050
instead of just
having a QE of one,

00:49:48.050 --> 00:49:50.930
going all the way out
to x-ray territory,

00:49:50.930 --> 00:49:54.070
we have a turn
off at some point.

00:49:54.070 --> 00:49:54.780
Why is that?

00:49:58.330 --> 00:50:02.320
Why in a real device
would we-- Yeah.

00:50:02.320 --> 00:50:04.260
We have glass absorbing,
on the front side,

00:50:04.260 --> 00:50:06.130
that's one real big reason.

00:50:06.130 --> 00:50:07.730
Do we have another idea?

00:50:11.710 --> 00:50:12.210
Yep.

00:50:12.210 --> 00:50:15.230
Glass absorption is
one real big one.

00:50:15.230 --> 00:50:17.650
There are other dead layers
inside of a solar cell device

00:50:17.650 --> 00:50:19.560
in the near surface
region that also absorb

00:50:19.560 --> 00:50:22.370
the light in some architecture.

00:50:22.370 --> 00:50:26.990
So it's not a perfect QE
spectrum that looks like that.

00:50:26.990 --> 00:50:29.080
But why don't we care?

00:50:29.080 --> 00:50:31.930
For the purposes of just
engineering approximation,

00:50:31.930 --> 00:50:34.470
why aren't we bothered
by these photons

00:50:34.470 --> 00:50:35.679
that we're losing down there?

00:50:35.679 --> 00:50:38.136
AUDIENCE: Because the percentage
of the solar spectrum that

00:50:38.136 --> 00:50:39.524
falls in that region is small.

00:50:39.524 --> 00:50:40.440
PROFESSOR: Absolutely.

00:50:40.440 --> 00:50:42.720
So what we're doing is an
engineering approximation

00:50:42.720 --> 00:50:46.870
right here to get to a very
first cursory efficiency

00:50:46.870 --> 00:50:50.630
calculation, neglecting
things at the extremes.

00:50:50.630 --> 00:50:53.040
Two short wavelengths,
because there's just not

00:50:53.040 --> 00:50:54.920
a whole lot of solar
flux down there.

00:50:54.920 --> 00:50:56.880
And too long wavelengths,
because again,

00:50:56.880 --> 00:50:58.880
not a whole lot of
solar flux right there.

00:50:58.880 --> 00:51:06.010
So we're going to be using this
approximation in our homeworks

00:51:06.010 --> 00:51:09.660
and that will get
us somewhat close.

00:51:09.660 --> 00:51:14.210
If we really want it to be
true, instead of using a box

00:51:14.210 --> 00:51:16.720
function like this, an
absorption box function,

00:51:16.720 --> 00:51:19.200
we would use an
absorption spectrum that

00:51:19.200 --> 00:51:24.000
looks something more like that.

00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:27.180
We've used a two
absorption spectrum.

00:51:27.180 --> 00:51:29.650
And then convolute that with
the thickness of the device

00:51:29.650 --> 00:51:34.200
to calculate what fraction
of photons at each energy

00:51:34.200 --> 00:51:36.430
is absorbed inside of my device.

00:51:36.430 --> 00:51:38.629
And that would give
you a plot that

00:51:38.629 --> 00:51:39.920
looks something more like this.

00:51:39.920 --> 00:51:42.350
Instead of this
box plot up here,

00:51:42.350 --> 00:51:45.550
it might give you plot that
looks something more like this.

00:51:45.550 --> 00:51:48.790
So you'd have instead
of just a sharp turn on,

00:51:48.790 --> 00:51:50.960
if you had a one micron
thick silicon wafer,

00:51:50.960 --> 00:51:52.460
and we calculated
last class that we

00:51:52.460 --> 00:51:54.418
need somewhere around 10
microns or 100 microns

00:51:54.418 --> 00:51:56.170
to absorb light
well, if we reduce

00:51:56.170 --> 00:51:58.140
the thickness of the
wafer to 1/10 or 1/100

00:51:58.140 --> 00:51:59.910
of what's necessary
to absorb light well,

00:51:59.910 --> 00:52:02.580
we don't see that sharp
turn on at the band gap.

00:52:02.580 --> 00:52:05.067
We see rather a gradual
turn on of our silicon

00:52:05.067 --> 00:52:07.150
as we move to shorter and
shorter wavelengths that

00:52:07.150 --> 00:52:11.240
are absorbed more and more
efficiently by the device.

00:52:11.240 --> 00:52:13.870
So again, just wrapping our
head around the basic concept

00:52:13.870 --> 00:52:16.520
that we're going to use for the
purposes of our calculation,

00:52:16.520 --> 00:52:18.980
but, again, some of the
more fine structure,

00:52:18.980 --> 00:52:21.290
some of the more advanced
concepts that come into

00:52:21.290 --> 00:52:24.790
play when we're doing more
detailed calculations.

00:52:24.790 --> 00:52:27.370
Approximating
thermalization losses now.

00:52:27.370 --> 00:52:29.480
We want to calculate
the amount of energy

00:52:29.480 --> 00:52:32.650
lost of incident sunlight
lost due to thermalization,

00:52:32.650 --> 00:52:33.624
due to heat.

00:52:33.624 --> 00:52:36.290
And we're going to say here that
if the photon energy is greater

00:52:36.290 --> 00:52:37.970
than the band gap,
than the photon

00:52:37.970 --> 00:52:41.239
energy is approximately the
band gap plus thermalization.

00:52:41.239 --> 00:52:43.280
Another way to put it
would be the thermalization

00:52:43.280 --> 00:52:44.696
is approximately
the photon energy

00:52:44.696 --> 00:52:47.357
minus the band gap energy.

00:52:47.357 --> 00:52:49.190
I kind of wanted to
hide all this down here.

00:52:49.190 --> 00:52:50.472
Forget this exists right now.

00:52:50.472 --> 00:52:51.680
Let's focus on that top part.

00:52:51.680 --> 00:52:54.184
So that's the easy way
of thinking about it.

00:52:54.184 --> 00:52:55.725
We're going to be
thinking about this

00:52:55.725 --> 00:52:58.360
in terms of just
any photon coming

00:52:58.360 --> 00:52:59.950
into our device
with a larger energy

00:52:59.950 --> 00:53:02.800
than the band gap is going to
generate one electron hole pair

00:53:02.800 --> 00:53:06.850
and lose some energy
due to thermalization.

00:53:06.850 --> 00:53:10.371
The reality is that for
very high energy photons,

00:53:10.371 --> 00:53:12.870
say for example photons with
three times the band gap energy

00:53:12.870 --> 00:53:16.180
or more, you could have
electron-electron interactions.

00:53:16.180 --> 00:53:19.074
So if you excite one electron
to very highly excited state,

00:53:19.074 --> 00:53:20.990
it can bounce around and
in the process excite

00:53:20.990 --> 00:53:23.500
another electron
across the band gap.

00:53:23.500 --> 00:53:26.900
That's the case when x-rays are
incident on a piece of silicon.

00:53:26.900 --> 00:53:30.300
For instance, if you have
a 10 kilo-electron volt,

00:53:30.300 --> 00:53:34.020
so a 10,000 eV x-ray incident
on a piece of silicon,

00:53:34.020 --> 00:53:36.880
you will generate approximately
3,000 electron hole pairs

00:53:36.880 --> 00:53:38.196
with that one x-ray.

00:53:38.196 --> 00:53:40.320
Because that one x-ray is
going to take an electron

00:53:40.320 --> 00:53:42.400
and excite it to very
highly excited state,

00:53:42.400 --> 00:53:45.130
and that's going to
excite further electrons

00:53:45.130 --> 00:53:49.300
across the band gap as that
excited carrier decays,

00:53:49.300 --> 00:53:53.370
as it loses it's energy and
settles at the conduction band

00:53:53.370 --> 00:53:54.580
minimum.

00:53:54.580 --> 00:53:59.499
So we have what's called
multiple exciton generation.

00:53:59.499 --> 00:54:01.540
Sometimes we've heard it
as multiple free carrier

00:54:01.540 --> 00:54:02.450
generation.

00:54:02.450 --> 00:54:04.260
In semiconductors,
it's a hot topic,

00:54:04.260 --> 00:54:06.600
because folks would like to
take the ultraviolet portion

00:54:06.600 --> 00:54:09.650
of the spectrum, the high
energy, short wavelength,

00:54:09.650 --> 00:54:11.760
portion of the solar
spectrum, and use

00:54:11.760 --> 00:54:13.580
it to excite multiple carriers.

00:54:13.580 --> 00:54:16.940
One photon exciting multiple
carriers across the band gap.

00:54:16.940 --> 00:54:19.099
And so there's some
work, or was some work,

00:54:19.099 --> 00:54:20.390
it was a hot topic for a while.

00:54:20.390 --> 00:54:21.515
It's kind of decayed a bit.

00:54:21.515 --> 00:54:22.450
It comes in waves.

00:54:22.450 --> 00:54:24.690
It cycles, kind of
like a plane wave.

00:54:24.690 --> 00:54:27.730
There is an interest, a
general interest in the field,

00:54:27.730 --> 00:54:29.890
of how do you capture
these higher energy photons

00:54:29.890 --> 00:54:31.429
and convert them
in some usable way,

00:54:31.429 --> 00:54:33.220
instead of just having
thermalization loss,

00:54:33.220 --> 00:54:35.360
instead of just having heat.

00:54:35.360 --> 00:54:37.030
And then for really
high energy photons,

00:54:37.030 --> 00:54:39.530
gosh, you can really get
into some neat physics.

00:54:39.530 --> 00:54:42.730
I've given you a link
and cross section here.

00:54:42.730 --> 00:54:46.510
This is the electron
cross section, or actually

00:54:46.510 --> 00:54:50.280
really what it is is an
anatomic cross section,

00:54:50.280 --> 00:54:53.020
because of the electrons in
the material versus photon

00:54:53.020 --> 00:54:57.140
energy going through 10
eV out to 10 to eV 11.

00:54:57.140 --> 00:54:59.080
A very high photon energy.

00:54:59.080 --> 00:55:05.520
We're transiting from the
visible spectrum over here

00:55:05.520 --> 00:55:07.890
deep into the infrared, and
then going into the x-ray,

00:55:07.890 --> 00:55:09.390
and finally to the
gamma ray regime.

00:55:09.390 --> 00:55:11.598
There you can have a number
of interesting phenomena.

00:55:11.598 --> 00:55:14.370
You can even have an electron
hole, or electron-positron pair

00:55:14.370 --> 00:55:18.180
generation with
gigaelectron-volt incident

00:55:18.180 --> 00:55:18.977
radiation or above.

00:55:18.977 --> 00:55:20.810
We're not gonna even
talk about this regime,

00:55:20.810 --> 00:55:25.060
because the total amount of
solar flux in that regime

00:55:25.060 --> 00:55:27.285
is really tiny
compared to visible.

00:55:27.285 --> 00:55:29.410
But it's a lot of interesting,
fascinating physics.

00:55:29.410 --> 00:55:32.890
So I put it on here anyway
just to keep our approximation

00:55:32.890 --> 00:55:34.410
in focus.

00:55:34.410 --> 00:55:38.120
So again, I'm kind of mixing
the forest in the trees

00:55:38.120 --> 00:55:40.320
here to give you a
sense of the complexity.

00:55:40.320 --> 00:55:42.860
But also to give you the
tools necessary to do

00:55:42.860 --> 00:55:44.240
simple calculations.

00:55:44.240 --> 00:55:48.250
We're going to combine this
simple approximation right here

00:55:48.250 --> 00:55:50.010
of the non-absorption losses.

00:55:50.010 --> 00:55:52.992
We're going to say that
any photon with energy

00:55:52.992 --> 00:55:55.450
less than the band gap doesn't
get absorbed by our crystal.

00:55:55.450 --> 00:55:57.552
It's gone to us.

00:55:57.552 --> 00:55:59.260
And we're going to
make the approximation

00:55:59.260 --> 00:56:01.770
that any photon with
energy above the band gap

00:56:01.770 --> 00:56:05.510
will have that excess energy
loss due to thermalization.

00:56:05.510 --> 00:56:07.180
And we put those
two things together.

00:56:07.180 --> 00:56:10.460
And one very convenient
way of representing this

00:56:10.460 --> 00:56:12.260
is shown in a paper in 1980.

00:56:12.260 --> 00:56:13.710
Let me walk you through it.

00:56:13.710 --> 00:56:17.860
So this curve right here,
this outermost curve,

00:56:17.860 --> 00:56:22.020
represents the solar
spectrum, energy versus number

00:56:22.020 --> 00:56:23.110
of photons.

00:56:23.110 --> 00:56:28.230
So we have essentially
a photon density.

00:56:28.230 --> 00:56:32.030
This is number of photons per
centimeter squared, per second.

00:56:32.030 --> 00:56:35.350
So photon flux, if you will.

00:56:35.350 --> 00:56:39.530
And over here we have the
energy of those photons.

00:56:39.530 --> 00:56:41.820
And so what this is
meant to represent

00:56:41.820 --> 00:56:43.760
is the cumulative
solar spectrum,

00:56:43.760 --> 00:56:46.037
going from a high
energy here all the way

00:56:46.037 --> 00:56:47.120
down to the lowest energy.

00:56:47.120 --> 00:56:51.380
So we're essentially adding
the different components,

00:56:51.380 --> 00:56:52.940
cumulation plot.

00:56:52.940 --> 00:56:58.500
And if we have a photon energy
in excess of the band gap

00:56:58.500 --> 00:57:01.270
energy, as would be the case,
say, for example three eV

00:57:01.270 --> 00:57:06.830
photon, and let's say the band
gap is 1.35 eV, represented

00:57:06.830 --> 00:57:08.660
by this straight
line right here,

00:57:08.660 --> 00:57:11.146
this energy is going to be lost.

00:57:11.146 --> 00:57:12.770
And so by drawing
this cumulation plot,

00:57:12.770 --> 00:57:17.750
we're plotting the area here,
the energy area that is lost

00:57:17.750 --> 00:57:20.710
to us due to thermalization.

00:57:20.710 --> 00:57:24.390
We could also say that if
the photons have an energy

00:57:24.390 --> 00:57:29.510
less than the band gap, that is
going to be lost to us as well.

00:57:29.510 --> 00:57:32.750
And what we're left with is
a little box that represents

00:57:32.750 --> 00:57:34.810
the total usable
photons, the usable

00:57:34.810 --> 00:57:39.160
photons that we
can extract device.

00:57:39.160 --> 00:57:41.120
This particular
plot is a little bit

00:57:41.120 --> 00:57:43.970
complicated, because
it contains two curves.

00:57:43.970 --> 00:57:45.640
One is this one right here.

00:57:45.640 --> 00:57:47.930
The other one is
this one right here.

00:57:47.930 --> 00:57:53.100
This second curve represents
another realistic loss

00:57:53.100 --> 00:57:55.390
mechanism that we
didn't talk about yet.

00:57:55.390 --> 00:58:00.560
And that is why the extractable
work, represented as w,

00:58:00.560 --> 00:58:02.399
is going to be less
than the band gap energy

00:58:02.399 --> 00:58:03.440
of our solar cell device.

00:58:03.440 --> 00:58:07.650
So if the band gap is 1.35
eV, the total usable work

00:58:07.650 --> 00:58:11.350
would be 0.9 eV, we'll get
to that in a lecture or two.

00:58:11.350 --> 00:58:13.170
And that's why
the white box here

00:58:13.170 --> 00:58:18.950
is going to be smaller than this
horizontal line box over there.

00:58:18.950 --> 00:58:24.240
But it gives you a very first
approximation, a very easy way

00:58:24.240 --> 00:58:28.020
to describe the different losses
that can occur in a solar cell,

00:58:28.020 --> 00:58:31.990
and quickly visualize
them here, thermalization.

00:58:31.990 --> 00:58:34.030
Over here, non-absorption.

00:58:34.030 --> 00:58:38.990
And plot them out very
nicely as the total area

00:58:38.990 --> 00:58:40.580
and representative
area fractions.

00:58:40.580 --> 00:58:42.080
And that's why you
can see here that

00:58:42.080 --> 00:58:46.970
the total usable
solar energy is going

00:58:46.970 --> 00:58:50.110
to be somewhere around 30%.

00:58:50.110 --> 00:58:52.860
This band gap right
here, around 1.35 eV

00:58:52.860 --> 00:58:56.050
is actually pretty near
optimal for the solar spectrum.

00:58:56.050 --> 00:58:59.800
You can imagine if we
increase the band gap energy,

00:58:59.800 --> 00:59:01.930
we would be doing
something like this.

00:59:01.930 --> 00:59:04.400
So we would draw another
box right around here.

00:59:04.400 --> 00:59:07.230
This would be the new
band gap, instead of 1.35,

00:59:07.230 --> 00:59:08.760
that would be out here.

00:59:08.760 --> 00:59:10.260
If we increase the
band gap further,

00:59:10.260 --> 00:59:12.400
we might have something
that looks like that.

00:59:12.400 --> 00:59:13.990
And the area of this
little rectangle

00:59:13.990 --> 00:59:17.441
would be much smaller than
the area of this rectangle.

00:59:17.441 --> 00:59:19.940
Likewise, if we said, OK, we're
going to shrink our band gap

00:59:19.940 --> 00:59:25.062
energy to avoid
non-absorption loss,

00:59:25.062 --> 00:59:27.270
we're going to have an excess
of thermalization loss.

00:59:27.270 --> 00:59:30.280
We'll have a very narrow
rectangle, right, like this,

00:59:30.280 --> 00:59:32.522
and all of this would be loss.

00:59:32.522 --> 00:59:34.480
The solar spectrum,
obviously, does not change.

00:59:34.480 --> 00:59:39.680
This line right here this
is fixed, it's constant.

00:59:39.680 --> 00:59:41.380
You folks kind of see it?

00:59:41.380 --> 00:59:42.470
Beginning to grasp it?

00:59:42.470 --> 00:59:46.860
This is a convenient way of
representing the total usable

00:59:46.860 --> 00:59:50.560
portion of the solar spectrum
from a given semiconductor

00:59:50.560 --> 00:59:52.520
material.

00:59:52.520 --> 00:59:55.261
You can begin seeing the trade
offs between different material

00:59:55.261 --> 00:59:55.760
systems.

00:59:55.760 --> 00:59:57.843
You can say, what happens
if I change my band gap?

00:59:57.843 --> 01:00:00.050
How would that change
the fraction of photons,

01:00:00.050 --> 01:00:02.510
or fraction of photon
energy not absorbed?

01:00:02.510 --> 01:00:05.920
Or fraction of photon energy
lost due to thermalization.

01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:07.640
And you can also
see what happens

01:00:07.640 --> 01:00:09.660
if you-- what would
be an easy way

01:00:09.660 --> 01:00:12.390
to extract more
potential for the sun?

01:00:12.390 --> 01:00:16.440
Instead of just using one
semiconductor material, you?

01:00:16.440 --> 01:00:17.072
More than one.

01:00:17.072 --> 01:00:17.655
More than one.

01:00:17.655 --> 01:00:17.710
Right.

01:00:17.710 --> 01:00:19.876
So now you're drawing
different boxes that represent

01:00:19.876 --> 01:00:20.912
the different materials.

01:00:20.912 --> 01:00:22.370
And if you stack
them right, you're

01:00:22.370 --> 01:00:25.730
able to capture more of
this total area, more

01:00:25.730 --> 01:00:29.310
of the total solar spectrum.

01:00:29.310 --> 01:00:32.220
So this is a really cool plot.

01:00:32.220 --> 01:00:35.927
A lot of good work back
in the 1970s, 1980s.

01:00:35.927 --> 01:00:37.510
If you recall from
lecture number one,

01:00:37.510 --> 01:00:41.500
this was the first wave of
real hardcore solar science,

01:00:41.500 --> 01:00:43.620
after the initial
Bell Labs invention.

01:00:43.620 --> 01:00:47.505
When we had the OPEC oil crises,
and there was a large rush

01:00:47.505 --> 01:00:49.150
of funding into solar research.

01:00:49.150 --> 01:00:51.525
So you had a lot of good work
coming out from those days.

01:00:54.900 --> 01:00:56.730
This next plot that
I'm going to show you

01:00:56.730 --> 01:01:04.650
represents the area of this box
relative to the solar spectrum,

01:01:04.650 --> 01:01:08.270
the percentage of
light that is usable,

01:01:08.270 --> 01:01:10.330
the balance between
non-absorption thermalization

01:01:10.330 --> 01:01:12.146
losses as a function
of band gap energy.

01:01:12.146 --> 01:01:14.020
So if the band gap is
too small, again, we're

01:01:14.020 --> 01:01:15.420
losing a lot of energy
due to thermalization.

01:01:15.420 --> 01:01:17.500
If the band gap's too
large, a lot of energy

01:01:17.500 --> 01:01:19.350
we're losing to non-absorption.

01:01:19.350 --> 01:01:22.010
And somewhere in the
middle is our happy medium.

01:01:22.010 --> 01:01:24.550
These little symbols here
represent different materials.

01:01:24.550 --> 01:01:26.008
Cadmium sulfide,
cadmium telluride,

01:01:26.008 --> 01:01:28.330
gallium arsenide, indium
phosphide, silicon, germanium,

01:01:28.330 --> 01:01:31.870
and so forth, and
calculated efficiencies.

01:01:31.870 --> 01:01:34.140
So I'm going to go into
one advanced concept,

01:01:34.140 --> 01:01:36.300
the multi-junction devices.

01:01:36.300 --> 01:01:39.150
And we just talked
about this box here

01:01:39.150 --> 01:01:43.100
representing the usable energy
from the solar spectrum.

01:01:43.100 --> 01:01:47.160
Now if we go to an absurd
case of 36 band gaps.

01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:51.170
If we imagine 36 materials
with graded band gaps,

01:01:51.170 --> 01:01:53.890
starting from large band
gap at the top to small band

01:01:53.890 --> 01:01:57.030
gap at the back, you
can envision almost

01:01:57.030 --> 01:01:58.950
approximating the entire curve.

01:01:58.950 --> 01:02:02.290
And you can estimate
what the upper efficiency

01:02:02.290 --> 01:02:05.110
limit would be with many band
gaps inside of your material.

01:02:05.110 --> 01:02:08.960
So for one band gap,
somewhere around 37,

01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:10.930
we'll have an entire
lecture dedicated

01:02:10.930 --> 01:02:12.850
to calculating that number.

01:02:12.850 --> 01:02:14.460
For two band gaps
somewhere around 50.

01:02:14.460 --> 01:02:16.330
For three band gaps, 56.

01:02:16.330 --> 01:02:19.450
For 36 band gaps around 72.

01:02:19.450 --> 01:02:22.500
So you can begin seeing how
the efficiency of solar energy

01:02:22.500 --> 01:02:26.210
conversion changes as you
change or add materials,

01:02:26.210 --> 01:02:28.130
you move materials
to your system.

01:02:28.130 --> 01:02:31.300
So how do you practically
do that in a real device?

01:02:31.300 --> 01:02:34.114
Well one method is to put one
material on top of another,

01:02:34.114 --> 01:02:35.780
much like it's
demonstrated right there.

01:02:35.780 --> 01:02:37.850
You have E versus x.

01:02:37.850 --> 01:02:41.320
So I have my E versus x, and
I have multiple materials.

01:02:41.320 --> 01:02:45.610
Another way to do it would be
to use optics to split our light

01:02:45.610 --> 01:02:46.530
into different colors.

01:02:46.530 --> 01:02:50.990
So if we have polychromatic
or multi-colored light coming

01:02:50.990 --> 01:02:53.020
into our system, we
somehow have a set

01:02:53.020 --> 01:02:56.172
of optics put up that
reflect one color, or one

01:02:56.172 --> 01:02:57.880
band of the solar
spectrum, while letting

01:02:57.880 --> 01:03:00.550
the other portion of the
solar spectrum through it.

01:03:00.550 --> 01:03:03.490
And we have different solar
cells with different band gaps,

01:03:03.490 --> 01:03:06.070
each matched to
the incident light.

01:03:06.070 --> 01:03:09.190
Each matched to the
particular color of light.

01:03:09.190 --> 01:03:13.370
Notice this paper, 1982,
this concept was out.

01:03:13.370 --> 01:03:16.320
So again, during that first
wave of real photovoltaics

01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:20.920
innovation in the late
1970s and early 1980s.

01:03:20.920 --> 01:03:23.750
And this was coming right
out of Lincoln Laboratory.

01:03:23.750 --> 01:03:26.990
This is about 35
minutes north of here.

01:03:26.990 --> 01:03:32.280
And this group at the time, the
group number continues to exist

01:03:32.280 --> 01:03:33.854
and is in operation
at Lincoln Labs.

01:03:33.854 --> 01:03:35.770
So most of the people
have moved on obviously,

01:03:35.770 --> 01:03:40.000
but several of the ideas
continue to this day.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:41.550
There was a more
recent incarnation

01:03:41.550 --> 01:03:45.390
in 2009 of a spectral splitter,
a very similar concept

01:03:45.390 --> 01:03:47.270
as you can see,
optics to concentrate

01:03:47.270 --> 01:03:50.400
the light, a dichroic
mirror, meaning

01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:51.900
it reflects certain
wavelengths, let

01:03:51.900 --> 01:03:53.750
another portion of
the spectrum past,

01:03:53.750 --> 01:03:58.140
and solar cell devices down
below absorbing efficiently

01:03:58.140 --> 01:04:00.700
in that region of the spectrum
and avoiding thermalization

01:04:00.700 --> 01:04:04.030
losses, and avoiding
non-absorption losses.

01:04:04.030 --> 01:04:07.380
This was a $50 million
DARPA project, in fact,

01:04:07.380 --> 01:04:11.070
involving University of Delaware
and several other companies.

01:04:11.070 --> 01:04:13.960
And they published
the results in 2009.

01:04:13.960 --> 01:04:16.520
It was one of their wrap
up papers that described

01:04:16.520 --> 01:04:18.090
the results of the project.

01:04:18.090 --> 01:04:19.900
So concepts.

01:04:19.900 --> 01:04:24.360
To this day, this
spectral splitter it's not

01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:26.094
in commercial production.

01:04:26.094 --> 01:04:28.760
What is in commercial production
are the multi-junction devices,

01:04:28.760 --> 01:04:31.140
where you stack one
on top of another.

01:04:31.140 --> 01:04:34.230
And we'll actually be having the
benefit of using some of them

01:04:34.230 --> 01:04:35.210
in class.

01:04:35.210 --> 01:04:38.490
Boeing spectral lab was kind
enough to donate a set of them

01:04:38.490 --> 01:04:40.030
for our class purposes.

01:04:40.030 --> 01:04:42.440
Yes, question.

01:04:42.440 --> 01:04:44.274
AUDIENCE: This is
also basically what

01:04:44.274 --> 01:04:48.170
plants do by having
multiple different pigment

01:04:48.170 --> 01:04:51.092
molecules in leaves, right?

01:04:51.092 --> 01:04:53.835
That would absorb the
different wavelengths?

01:04:53.835 --> 01:04:56.240
PROFESSOR: Well, it's not
exactly separating light

01:04:56.240 --> 01:04:57.560
by optics in that case.

01:04:57.560 --> 01:04:58.490
So the question was--

01:04:58.490 --> 01:04:59.990
AUDIENCE: No, I
mean multi-junction.

01:04:59.990 --> 01:05:01.720
PROFESSOR: Oh, the
multi-junction idea.

01:05:01.720 --> 01:05:05.190
Yes, if you consider
that there is a reaction

01:05:05.190 --> 01:05:07.180
process occurring in series.

01:05:07.180 --> 01:05:09.560
The important
distinguishing feature

01:05:09.560 --> 01:05:12.360
of the multi-junction device
is that the same current

01:05:12.360 --> 01:05:14.220
is flowing through
the entire device.

01:05:14.220 --> 01:05:17.550
So each sub cell has to be
current matched to the others,

01:05:17.550 --> 01:05:19.140
because the cumulative
current output

01:05:19.140 --> 01:05:21.700
is a harmonic mean of each one.

01:05:21.700 --> 01:05:25.850
So in other words, you're
limited by the worst resistor

01:05:25.850 --> 01:05:27.920
in series, if you will.

01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:30.172
So it's very tricky
to engineer properly

01:05:30.172 --> 01:05:31.380
these multi-junction devices.

01:05:31.380 --> 01:05:33.921
You have to be thinking about
the current output for each sub

01:05:33.921 --> 01:05:35.499
cell and match the currents.

01:05:35.499 --> 01:05:37.540
That means you match the
geometry, the thickness,

01:05:37.540 --> 01:05:40.720
but also the resistivity
of each layer and so forth.

01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:44.120
So similar to a
plant, but not quite.

01:05:44.120 --> 01:05:46.460
There are some special
characteristics

01:05:46.460 --> 01:05:49.250
of the inorganic system.

01:05:49.250 --> 01:05:52.040
So we have a small
demonstration.

01:05:52.040 --> 01:05:54.830
I'd like to welcome Joe
up to the front as well.

01:05:54.830 --> 01:05:57.080
We have a small demonstration
of a few of the concepts

01:05:57.080 --> 01:05:58.870
that we've covered
today in class.

01:05:58.870 --> 01:06:01.710
We're going to be exciting
silicon with light,

01:06:01.710 --> 01:06:04.920
and we're going to be monitoring
the current output using

01:06:04.920 --> 01:06:09.320
this little resistance
measurement device right here.

01:06:09.320 --> 01:06:11.560
So actually I think it's
set to a current readout.

01:06:11.560 --> 01:06:12.434
Yes, current readout.

01:06:12.434 --> 01:06:16.040
So it's in microamps right now,
probably going to milliamps.

01:06:16.040 --> 01:06:16.760
Is that right?

01:06:16.760 --> 01:06:18.470
OK, so milliamp current readout.

01:06:18.470 --> 01:06:20.960
Let me explain to you
what we have right here.

01:06:20.960 --> 01:06:25.530
We have a bare piece of
silicon, and two electric leads

01:06:25.530 --> 01:06:26.370
on either side.

01:06:26.370 --> 01:06:29.160
So a bare piece of
silicon, no device.

01:06:29.160 --> 01:06:31.340
Just a piece of silicon.

01:06:31.340 --> 01:06:33.810
And we have electrical leads
coming out of either side.

01:06:33.810 --> 01:06:36.130
We have a very low resistance
contact on either end.

01:06:36.130 --> 01:06:37.546
For those who are
curious, we used

01:06:37.546 --> 01:06:39.880
a mixture of indium and
gallium, soldering iron,

01:06:39.880 --> 01:06:42.690
scratch the surface, penetrated
the native surface oxide,

01:06:42.690 --> 01:06:44.920
and put the electrical
leads on either side.

01:06:44.920 --> 01:06:48.050
And we have this
connected in series here

01:06:48.050 --> 01:06:51.730
to our current readout device.

01:06:51.730 --> 01:06:56.830
So now what we're going to do is
we're going to illuminate this.

01:06:56.830 --> 01:07:00.370
And again, bare silicon
leads on either side,

01:07:00.370 --> 01:07:02.450
and we're going to be
passing the current

01:07:02.450 --> 01:07:04.680
through the current
measurement system.

01:07:04.680 --> 01:07:06.300
Before we turn it
on, we're going

01:07:06.300 --> 01:07:09.550
to ask people, how
many people expect

01:07:09.550 --> 01:07:12.550
there to be current
driving through the system?

01:07:12.550 --> 01:07:14.600
We have light incident
on the material.

01:07:14.600 --> 01:07:15.700
We're exciting charges.

01:07:15.700 --> 01:07:18.720
Based on today's lecture, there
should be free charges moving

01:07:18.720 --> 01:07:20.080
around that material now.

01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:23.220
How many expect a
current to flow?

01:07:23.220 --> 01:07:24.000
A few.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.130
But a lot of people
shaking their heads.

01:07:26.130 --> 01:07:30.357
Why do you think a
current won't flow?

01:07:30.357 --> 01:07:31.440
There's no electric field.

01:07:31.440 --> 01:07:32.315
There's no potential.

01:07:32.315 --> 01:07:34.460
Why don't we give it a
shot, and why don't we see.

01:07:34.460 --> 01:07:40.770
If we turn this on right
now, what do we see?

01:07:40.770 --> 01:07:41.690
We see zero.

01:07:41.690 --> 01:07:42.200
Right.

01:07:42.200 --> 01:07:44.330
Can some of the folks right
here in the front see?

01:07:44.330 --> 01:07:46.390
Says zero.

01:07:46.390 --> 01:07:49.149
All right, so what this
is telling us again,

01:07:49.149 --> 01:07:51.690
you're welcome to come up after
class and take a closer look.

01:07:51.690 --> 01:07:55.300
What this is telling us here is
that yes, what we talked about

01:07:55.300 --> 01:07:56.519
in class is important today.

01:07:56.519 --> 01:07:58.060
Yes, it's all very
important and it's

01:07:58.060 --> 01:08:01.070
the foundation of calculating
ultimate solar cell

01:08:01.070 --> 01:08:03.410
efficiency, how the material
absorbs the light, how

01:08:03.410 --> 01:08:04.740
charge is excited.

01:08:04.740 --> 01:08:06.590
But we need something else too.

01:08:06.590 --> 01:08:09.220
Once the charge is
excited, somehow we

01:08:09.220 --> 01:08:11.840
have to give it an incentive
to leave the material.

01:08:11.840 --> 01:08:14.229
We have to have a field.

01:08:14.229 --> 01:08:16.520
In this case, we're going to
be using an applied field,

01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:18.920
a couple of batteries.

01:08:18.920 --> 01:08:21.250
So total voltage around
three volts, applied

01:08:21.250 --> 01:08:25.310
across that small material.

01:08:25.310 --> 01:08:27.600
But in a solar
cell device, we're

01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:30.270
going to have a built
in electric field

01:08:30.270 --> 01:08:32.757
that we'll engineer
into the device.

01:08:32.757 --> 01:08:34.590
And we'll talk about
that over next lecture.

01:08:34.590 --> 01:08:37.800
So just for purposes of sanity,
we have our batteries now

01:08:37.800 --> 01:08:40.720
connected in series, and
is now applying a potential

01:08:40.720 --> 01:08:42.000
across those two leads.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.477
And now if we turn on the
light, what do we expect?

01:08:44.477 --> 01:08:46.310
We expect to see some
current going through.

01:08:50.750 --> 01:08:55.840
And voila, we have a
current running through it.

01:08:55.840 --> 01:08:58.319
So now, what is the
nature of that current?

01:08:58.319 --> 01:09:00.821
If we move the light closer,
we see the number go up.

01:09:00.821 --> 01:09:02.279
What is the nature
of that current?

01:09:02.279 --> 01:09:04.700
That current is photo excited.

01:09:04.700 --> 01:09:06.700
That current is
exciting electrons

01:09:06.700 --> 01:09:08.979
from the valence band,
from bound states,

01:09:08.979 --> 01:09:11.370
into the conduction band,
it's unbound states,

01:09:11.370 --> 01:09:13.450
where they can move freely
across the material.

01:09:13.450 --> 01:09:15.450
And now, because we have
that potential applied

01:09:15.450 --> 01:09:18.050
across the material, there's
an incentive for them

01:09:18.050 --> 01:09:19.550
to drift in one direction.

01:09:19.550 --> 01:09:23.260
The net flow of electrons
is in one direction.

01:09:23.260 --> 01:09:27.029
We have a drift current in our
material, in our semiconductor,

01:09:27.029 --> 01:09:29.010
and hence we have
the flow of charge

01:09:29.010 --> 01:09:32.060
that is readable by this
current meter right here.

01:09:32.060 --> 01:09:35.729
So without the light,
we have no current.

01:09:35.729 --> 01:09:38.819
With the light, we have current
flowing through the material.

01:09:38.819 --> 01:09:40.740
But current and
light-- actually light

01:09:40.740 --> 01:09:44.189
is not the only thing necessary
to create that output current.

01:09:44.189 --> 01:09:46.396
We also need the potential.

01:09:46.396 --> 01:09:48.479
So next class we'll be
talking about the potential

01:09:48.479 --> 01:09:51.370
and how that's created inside
of a solar cell device.

01:09:51.370 --> 01:09:55.590
I've included a few slides
extra for people to see through.

01:09:55.590 --> 01:09:58.250
I'm going to explain once
again the experiment.

01:09:58.250 --> 01:10:00.780
We just had light coming in.

01:10:00.780 --> 01:10:02.190
It was in the visible.

01:10:02.190 --> 01:10:05.180
We were able to excite
carriers, but no current

01:10:05.180 --> 01:10:07.350
was observe because we
didn't have a potential.

01:10:07.350 --> 01:10:10.980
When we applied the battery,
or the potential across, now

01:10:10.980 --> 01:10:12.570
when we shone light
of the sample,

01:10:12.570 --> 01:10:15.310
we had a current
flowing through.

01:10:15.310 --> 01:10:17.460
And we even have a
current, a very small one,

01:10:17.460 --> 01:10:21.940
flowing through when we
have the battery applied

01:10:21.940 --> 01:10:22.910
without the light on.

01:10:22.910 --> 01:10:25.440
And you need microamp detection
I think to really see it.

01:10:28.630 --> 01:10:29.320
Yeah.

01:10:29.320 --> 01:10:30.480
Just from the battery.

01:10:30.480 --> 01:10:34.340
These are a very small
population of excited carriers,

01:10:34.340 --> 01:10:40.310
either thermally or donated to
the electron conduction band.

01:10:40.310 --> 01:10:45.070
Any questions before
we close for the day?

01:10:45.070 --> 01:10:45.750
Yes.

01:10:45.750 --> 01:10:49.396
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so I guess--
I'm the devices person in here,

01:10:49.396 --> 01:10:51.546
so also the notion of
the direct band gap,

01:10:51.546 --> 01:10:54.312
versus an indirect band gap,
are we going to discuss that?

01:10:54.312 --> 01:10:56.020
Or is that something
that's not relevant?

01:10:56.020 --> 01:10:57.750
PROFESSOR: We will
definitely discuss

01:10:57.750 --> 01:10:59.100
direct and indirect band gaps.

01:10:59.100 --> 01:11:02.511
So this goes back to
describing the notion

01:11:02.511 --> 01:11:04.010
of a direct and an
indirect band gap

01:11:04.010 --> 01:11:08.680
is fundamental for
describing the reason

01:11:08.680 --> 01:11:11.810
why these curves have
the shape they do.

01:11:11.810 --> 01:11:13.760
For example, this
one right here,

01:11:13.760 --> 01:11:19.307
if you plotted as alpha-- if
you plot it in a certain way,

01:11:19.307 --> 01:11:21.390
you'll be able to see a
very characteristic shape,

01:11:21.390 --> 01:11:24.520
indicative of direct transition
into a direct band gap.

01:11:24.520 --> 01:11:27.030
The reason we aren't launching
into several of those terms

01:11:27.030 --> 01:11:28.600
right now is because
several of your colleagues,

01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:30.730
more than half, don't have
a semiconductor physics

01:11:30.730 --> 01:11:31.660
background.

01:11:31.660 --> 01:11:33.382
And the beauty of
this approach is

01:11:33.382 --> 01:11:34.840
that you will be
able to understand

01:11:34.840 --> 01:11:38.370
most things about a solar cell
without really diving deep

01:11:38.370 --> 01:11:41.120
into the semiconductor
physics until it's necessary.

01:11:41.120 --> 01:11:43.010
And hopefully we keep
everybody with us.

01:11:43.010 --> 01:11:45.400
So for those who have a
strong semiconductor physics

01:11:45.400 --> 01:11:48.860
background, I bid you, I
urge you to have patience,

01:11:48.860 --> 01:11:51.310
because we will get to
the interesting stuff.

01:11:51.310 --> 01:11:53.710
But we're working on that
fundamental background

01:11:53.710 --> 01:11:54.760
right now.

01:11:54.760 --> 01:11:56.310
Thanks.

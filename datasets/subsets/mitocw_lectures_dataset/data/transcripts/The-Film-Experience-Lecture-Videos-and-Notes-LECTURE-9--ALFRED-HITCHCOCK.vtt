00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:32.210
DAVID THORBURN: We turn
today to Alfred Hitchcock,

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:33.810
one of the most
remarkable, if not

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:35.710
the most remarkable
and significant,

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.540
of what we might call the
great studio directors,

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.640
the people who worked
with great ease

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.750
and success inside
the studio system

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.160
that developed in
the United States--

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.420
began to develop in
the United States

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.520
in more than embryonic form,
in early systematic form

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.900
in the silent era and then
was fortified and extended

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.780
into the great
mass manufacturing

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.000
center for dreams and
movies, the Hollywood

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.570
system of the studio era.

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.350
And I wanted to begin by
saying a word about Hitchcock

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.360
in relation to
that great system.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.390
If we think about a famous
quotation from the great film

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:20.460
scholar, pioneering
film critic Andre Bazin,

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.770
to whom we will return
later in the semester.

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.330
Bazin, among his other
an influential comments,

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:32.440
this one is a particularly
powerful and significant one.

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:38.130
"The American cinema," he wrote
in 1957, "is a classical art,"

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.655
and it's unclear exactly
what he meant by that,

00:01:40.655 --> 00:01:42.930
but most critics assume
that what he meant by

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.520
that is that it's a system that
works according to essentially

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:52.030
classical genre forms, that
these genre forms have origins

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.910
behind the movies, and
that the system works

00:01:54.910 --> 00:02:00.740
in a kind of a generic
way, and that at least

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.710
that's a part of
what he meant when

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:03.970
he called it a classical art.

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:05.980
The American cinema
is a classical art,

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:11.140
but why not then admire it
in what is most admirable,

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.430
not only the talent of
this or that filmmaker,

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.970
but the genius of the system.

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:18.470
And I think I alluded
to this phrase

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.160
or used this phrase
earlier in the term,

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.230
and I want to do justice
to it by acknowledging

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.970
its origins in Andre Bazin.

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.380
There's also a wonderful book by
a film scholar from Texas named

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.740
Tom Schatz called The
Genius of the System,

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:35.230
and it borrows, it uses this
quotation as its inspiration,

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.680
and it's a systematic analysis
of the Hollywood studio

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.300
system in which it talks
about the interaction

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.730
of individual
agency-- the writers,

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.270
the directors,
the camera people,

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:48.730
and so forth, the
customers-- the interaction

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:54.270
of those creative or
semi-creative figures

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:58.080
with the manufacturing
and publicity practices

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.980
and rituals that surrounded
the production of movies

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.330
in which he tries to provide a
kind of integrated sense of how

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.150
the system worked to explore
what Bazin apparently

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.140
meant when he talked about
the genius of the system.

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.890
Well, one way of understanding
the genius of the system

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:19.190
is to recognize that it creates
an environment, first of all,

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.510
of stability in which
particular filmmakers

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:25.220
or particular
writers or directors

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:28.640
can have confidence-- sometimes
overwhelming confidence

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.270
because they're ordered to do
the job by the studio head--

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:35.760
can have confidence that the
genre stories they're creating

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:36.934
have an audience.

00:03:36.934 --> 00:03:38.850
And of course, that's
been sort of established

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.740
by the, essentially, assembly
line system that develops,

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:45.330
and the elaborate system
of distribution and access

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:46.940
that developed in
the United States.

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:48.940
The major studios actually,
although they only

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:54.579
controlled something like
16% of the resources they--

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:56.120
of movie-making--
actually controlled

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.479
a much larger percentage
of the theaters,

00:03:58.479 --> 00:04:00.770
because many of the theaters
either were owned outright

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:05.840
by studios or until a certain
point when a Supreme Court

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.170
decision divested
the studios from--

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:11.470
forced the studios
to divest themselves

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.200
from their theatrical holdings.

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.200
But when the system
was in place,

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.450
it was a monopoly system in
which the rich got richer,

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:21.640
in some sense, and the
major studios controlled,

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:24.140
owned many theaters
themselves and by a system

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:26.320
of what was called
block booking,

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:30.291
they forced theaters not
just to book particular films

00:04:30.291 --> 00:04:32.040
and particular stars
that they might like,

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:35.330
but MGM would say to
independent theater owners,

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.160
if you want the MGM films, you
have to take my whole card.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.242
You can't just choose
the Clark Gable movies,

00:04:40.242 --> 00:04:41.700
you have to choose
the whole thing.

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:45.110
And this stability
created an environment

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:49.970
in which each major studio
was confident that, in effect,

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:52.450
it had a captive
market for its product,

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:55.880
and it created an immense sense
of stability and confidence

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:59.750
when the system was
working at its best.

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:01.510
And of course,
again, because it was

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:04.370
a system that was committed
to entertaining the largest

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:06.740
number of people it
could reach as possible,

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:09.210
it meant that there were
certain parameters that

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:12.540
were established within which
the entire system was forced

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:13.040
operate.

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.242
Whatever genre was
involved, there

00:05:15.242 --> 00:05:16.450
were certain kinds of limits.

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:18.660
It's what I was talking
about earlier, trying

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:21.040
to get at this aspect
of the system earlier,

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:24.050
when I talked about the
idea of consensus narrative.

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:25.606
If the Hollywood
film is reaching out

00:05:25.606 --> 00:05:27.480
to the whole of the
society and it's telling,

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:30.550
essentially, a story that
appeals to or is supposed

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:34.970
to embody the consensus view,
the largest general view

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:38.570
of what the belief system of
the society is, what that means

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:41.540
is that there are limits,
very sharp constraints--

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:43.550
political and moral
constraints-- within which

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:44.400
the text operates.

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.730
And as you know, especially
if you've been reading your

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:50.360
[? Cook, ?] the introduction
of a particular sensory system

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:52.380
introduced by Hollywood
itself in order

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:54.070
to avoid other
kinds of censorship

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:56.300
perhaps from the
government, further

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:00.050
constrained the kinds of
stories that could be told.

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:02.150
Well, within those
constraints, of course,

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:04.540
as I hope I've already
begun to show you

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:06.640
in our discussion
of screwball comedy,

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:11.920
there can be an immense
range of difference,

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:15.300
but it's still within certain
controlled parameters.

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:17.170
And one of the
ways to understand

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:19.720
Hitchcock's immense
success is to recognize

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:22.300
that he had the kind of
sensibility, the kind

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:24.610
of artistic impulses,
and maybe even

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:28.350
the kinds of limitations that
made the studio system a kind

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:30.400
of perfect environment for him.

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:32.830
Anyone who's looked at a
Hitchcock-- more than one

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:35.260
or two Hitchcock films,
is aware of the fact

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.250
that there's
something obsessional,

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:40.950
something deeply disturbing
about Hitchcock's imagination.

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:42.960
He's drawn again,
and again, and again

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:46.080
to the same kinds of situations,
to scenes of violence

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:48.740
against women, to
scenes of confinement,

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:51.882
but the studio system was a
kind of perfect environment

00:06:51.882 --> 00:06:54.520
for these kinds
of preoccupations.

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:57.320
On the one hand, the
constraints of the system

00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:00.090
did not allow Hitchcock,
even if he had the impulse

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:03.230
to do so, to press so
far into the perversity

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:06.700
and disturbance that is the
general subject matter he is

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:10.520
looking at, as to actually
fall into, say, pornography

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:14.390
or to fall into something
that will deeply offend

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:16.170
some segment of the population.

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:18.120
We can see that
these were impulses

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:20.430
in Hitchcock's
imagination though,

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:23.630
because after the-- Hitchcock
lasted long enough, lived

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:26.500
for such a long time-- he
was a successful director

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:27.680
in the silent era.

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:29.740
Then he worked in Britain
during the sound era

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:32.740
and was the most well
known and successful

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:35.600
of all British directors
in the early sound era.

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:38.240
Then in 1940, he came to
the United States for what

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:40.940
as most people recognize
as his American phase.

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:43.160
He emigrated to
the United States

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:46.600
and that's a separate kind of
distinct part of his career,

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:50.330
as I'll describe in a little
more detail in a moment.

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:54.780
Well, by the end of
his career, Hollywood

00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:57.480
itself was undergoing
profound changes for reasons

00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:00.360
we've already begun to talk
about in this course, the most

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:03.390
important of them being
the advent of television

00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:05.530
and the way in which,
through the 1950s,

00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:08.580
television began to
leech away the consensus

00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:11.730
audience and the consensus
function that Hollywood

00:08:11.730 --> 00:08:13.220
had played in American life.

00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:16.220
And the effect this was to, in
some sense, liberate Hollywood,

00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:19.484
and we'll be talking about what
this ambiguous liberation later

00:08:19.484 --> 00:08:21.900
in the course when we look at
some of the great films that

00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:25.400
emerge in the 1970s that
are free of the constraints

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:26.970
of a consensus system.

00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:30.815
Films like McCabe & Mrs. Miller
or Cabaret, the two films

00:08:30.815 --> 00:08:32.440
that we're going to
be looking at later

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:36.250
that embody these sort
of post studio era ideals

00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:37.179
and principles.

00:08:37.179 --> 00:08:39.850
Well, one of the ways in which
you can see the damage that

00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:43.890
was-- the help that was given
to Hitchcock's own imagination

00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:46.630
by what I'm calling the
genius of the system,

00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:50.334
is that you can see that
Hitchcock's-- that the latest

00:08:50.334 --> 00:08:52.750
films that Hitchcock makes,
the films that Hitchcock makes

00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:57.520
at the very end of his career,
and especially a film--

00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:02.120
two films, a film called Frenzy
starring Michael Caine in 1972,

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:05.710
and the last film the Hitchcock
made in 1976 called Family

00:09:05.710 --> 00:09:06.340
Plot.

00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:08.540
The same basic
materials, but there's

00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:10.880
something gratuitous about
the nudity in these films.

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:13.970
He wasn't allowed to show
nudity in the studio era,

00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:16.030
and it was good for
his imagination.

00:09:16.030 --> 00:09:17.920
And when his
imagination-- and any

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:21.480
honorable-- any honest viewer
of Hitchcock watching Frenzy,

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:24.580
or especially Family
Plot, and watch--

00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:26.440
there's a scene
in Frenzy in which

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:28.310
a murderer strangles a woman.

00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:30.040
Now, there have been--
strangulation is

00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:32.200
one of Hitchcock's
favorite forms of murder,

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:34.070
and there've been many
characters strangled

00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:36.240
in Hitchcock's movie,
but this strangulation

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:38.550
has a pornographic
dimension to it

00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:40.862
that none of the early
scenes like that did.

00:09:40.862 --> 00:09:42.820
And it has to do with
the fact Hitchcock is now

00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:46.000
working in a film environment
that is not telling him

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.390
that he can't go too far,
and he does go too far.

00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:52.270
And there's a terrible scene
in which a murderer takes off

00:09:52.270 --> 00:09:55.390
his tie, and he strangles
this woman with a tie.

00:09:55.390 --> 00:09:57.040
The woman is naked
from the waist up,

00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:59.960
and you see her breasts
bobbling around on the screen

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:02.110
while she's being
strangled, and you

00:10:02.110 --> 00:10:04.190
can see that the
camera is enjoying

00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:08.280
looking at those breasts, even
though it's a scene of murder.

00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:10.930
It's a very, very horrible
scene, a very disturbing scene.

00:10:10.930 --> 00:10:13.236
It's a scene that-- it
almost is a scene that

00:10:13.236 --> 00:10:15.860
makes you believe in censorship,
to think that censorship ought

00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:17.860
to be-- certainly, you
wouldn't want young people

00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:18.430
to see this scene.

00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:19.980
Now, the only reason
that Hitchcock

00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:23.370
was free to create this scene
is that there were no longer

00:10:23.370 --> 00:10:25.070
the same constraints
being imposed

00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:28.060
upon him by what I want
to call the constraining

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:29.630
genius of the system.

00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:31.960
So my point is
that Hitchcock was

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:34.710
a man of obsessional
genius of a certain sort,

00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:36.960
but he had the
great good fortune

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:40.010
to work within a system
that also limited

00:10:40.010 --> 00:10:43.240
his liabilities,
that didn't even

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:46.530
allow the full expression
of his obsessions

00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:51.921
in ways that might become
deeply disturbing to audiences.

00:10:51.921 --> 00:10:54.170
The fact of the matter is,
when you look at that scene

00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:57.260
and then you think back at
many earlier Hitchcock movies,

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.220
you can see many
equivalents of it.

00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:02.469
Violence and damage to women
is a recurring obsession

00:11:02.469 --> 00:11:03.010
in Hitchcock.

00:11:03.010 --> 00:11:05.260
Hitchcock is a sick
man in many ways.

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:07.770
But he's not a sick
artist, he's a sick person.

00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:09.700
He turns his sickness into art.

00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:13.350
He turns his sickness into use
by dramatizing it and reminding

00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:16.260
us of the-- so insofar as
he's a good filmmaker, he's

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:22.070
not a-- he's not a
horrible perv, right?

00:11:22.070 --> 00:11:24.551
But there are perverted
dimensions to Hitchcock.

00:11:24.551 --> 00:11:26.550
And in fact, part of why
we find him interesting

00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:30.200
is his films are always hovering
on the brink of awakening

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:33.725
in us feelings that are
disturbing and unsettling,

00:11:33.725 --> 00:11:37.710
and that touch on deep
taboos in the ways

00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:40.180
in which our culture sort
of understands how we should

00:11:40.180 --> 00:11:48.220
behave, and especially in our
attitudes towards sexuality,

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:50.470
and towards seeing,
toward the act of seeing,

00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:52.690
which in Hitchcock becomes
a kind of voyeurism.

00:11:52.690 --> 00:11:54.640
So one way to
understand Hitchcock

00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:57.430
is to understand his genius,
his greatness as a director

00:11:57.430 --> 00:11:59.310
as being directly
connected to the fact

00:11:59.310 --> 00:12:01.730
that for the most
part of his career,

00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:04.270
he worked in systems
that constrained him.

00:12:04.270 --> 00:12:07.930
He worked in systems that had
a very sharp boundaries, that

00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:10.920
didn't allow him to do
certain kinds of things,

00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:13.130
and those limitations
were turned

00:12:13.130 --> 00:12:16.570
into artful and
valuable gestures.

00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:20.640
An anecdote that Hitchcock
told about himself many times,

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:22.960
this deeply revealing anecdote.

00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:24.380
It may not be true.

00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:26.580
We're not really sure, but
he told it so many times

00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:30.330
that it's true even
if it didn't happen.

00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:33.370
That's a line-- it's true
even if it didn't happen--

00:12:33.370 --> 00:12:35.510
it's a line from Ken
Kesey's wonderful novel,

00:12:35.510 --> 00:12:38.130
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.

00:12:38.130 --> 00:12:40.830
And the character, the
narrator in the book, who

00:12:40.830 --> 00:12:43.010
was sort of a crazy
man, or we think,

00:12:43.010 --> 00:12:45.260
he's in an insane asylum,
he's in a loony bin

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:47.440
when he starts
narrating the story,

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:49.350
tells us a story
of his confinement

00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:51.774
in a lunatic
asylum, and he says,

00:12:51.774 --> 00:12:54.190
you think the man who's saying
this is raving and crazing?

00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:57.390
My god, this is true
even if it didn't happen.

00:12:57.390 --> 00:13:00.120
And what he means is there's
a kind of emotional truth,

00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:01.840
even if the actual
facts aren't true.

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:04.470
And I think that's true of the
Hitchcock anecdote as well,

00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:08.170
and this is the anecdote he
repeatedly told about himself.

00:13:08.170 --> 00:13:11.630
He said, when he was a young
boy, five or six years-old,

00:13:11.630 --> 00:13:15.780
he committed some indiscretion
that his father disapproved of,

00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:18.280
and his father, in response,
without saying anything

00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:21.650
to the boy, wrote a note,
sealed it in an envelope,

00:13:21.650 --> 00:13:23.650
gave it to the boy, and
told him to take it down

00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:26.500
to the local constable--
the policeman

00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:28.190
in the police station
around the corner

00:13:28.190 --> 00:13:29.710
from where they lived in London.

00:13:29.710 --> 00:13:32.040
So the young boy dutifully
took the note to him,

00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:32.960
and then gave it
to the constable,

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:35.350
and the constable opened it,
read it, and locked the boy

00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:38.480
in a prison cell,
and kept him in there

00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:40.804
for a certain short
amount of time,

00:13:40.804 --> 00:13:42.470
and then finally
released him, and said,

00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:45.680
this is what
happens to bad boys.

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:48.420
And Hitchcock has said,
ever since then, I

00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:50.780
have gone to any
length to avoid arrest

00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:55.460
and to avoid confinement
in confining spaces.

00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:57.660
And in fact, if you think
about it for a second,

00:13:57.660 --> 00:14:01.610
over and over again
in Hitchcock's films,

00:14:01.610 --> 00:14:03.650
a basic story, not
the only story,

00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:06.220
but a basic story he tells
is the story of someone

00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:07.490
who is wrongly accused.

00:14:07.490 --> 00:14:09.930
We might call it the
wrong man theme, right?

00:14:09.930 --> 00:14:11.430
And someone who
was on the run, who

00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:13.650
looked at the
circumstantial evidence

00:14:13.650 --> 00:14:18.670
against him is-- or her, usually
him-- is overwhelming, right?

00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:19.520
Absolutely looks it.

00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:22.160
And all the authorities, all
the legitimate authorities

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:26.270
of the culture, think the
protagonist of the Hitchcock

00:14:26.270 --> 00:14:28.330
chase film is guilty, right?

00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:31.150
And his obligation is to
somehow not only escape

00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:34.920
the authorities, who are
much more powerful than he,

00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:39.590
of course, and have
at their fingertips

00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:44.750
all kinds of modern systems
for searching, and following,

00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:47.750
and capturing people,
and the fugitive

00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:50.780
is a lone fugitive on
his own without resources

00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:52.460
and without allies.

00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:55.724
So he's up against
tremendously difficult forces

00:14:55.724 --> 00:14:57.765
and these are the forces
of legitimate authority.

00:15:00.570 --> 00:15:03.010
So the theme of the wrong
man, who's wrongly accused.

00:15:03.010 --> 00:15:05.130
The audience knows that
he's wrongly accused.

00:15:05.130 --> 00:15:07.850
Often, Hitchcock will
show the real murderer

00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:11.480
and will show us how
circumstantially persuasive

00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:14.250
but also falsely evidence is,
so through most of the movie,

00:15:14.250 --> 00:15:17.740
we identify with the fugitive,
with the person who's running.

00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:19.830
We know he is innocent.

00:15:19.830 --> 00:15:22.200
So part of it is--
so many of his films

00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:25.360
then sort of dramatize a kind of
massive principle of injustice

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:28.160
that happens again and
again in his movies.

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:32.690
Authorities are almost
always after the wrong man.

00:15:32.690 --> 00:15:37.140
And then many of his films,
an overwhelmingly disturbing

00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:41.870
recurring element in his films,
is confinement in tight spaces,

00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:43.200
is the sense of being caught.

00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:46.640
And you'll see one of the
great, great instances of this,

00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:52.860
one of his most artistic
accountings of this impulse,

00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:55.030
this fear of confinement,
but this fascination

00:15:55.030 --> 00:15:56.570
with confinement,
in the great film

00:15:56.570 --> 00:15:59.210
you're going to see tonight,
Rear Window, which takes place

00:15:59.210 --> 00:16:02.170
entirely in a single
confined space, in a room,

00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:04.220
because the man who--
the protagonist has

00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:06.300
a broken leg at the
beginning of the film

00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:08.820
and he's literally unable to
move out of his apartment.

00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:11.250
So the entire film is confined
there, and, of course,

00:16:11.250 --> 00:16:13.200
many of Hitchcock's
films love this.

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:16.260
So what an interesting
anecdote to be told.

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:17.820
And think, by
implication, what it

00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:20.760
says about his
father, not to mention

00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:23.370
what it says about
Hitchcock himself

00:16:23.370 --> 00:16:25.940
to tell a story like this
so many times over the whole

00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:26.910
of his career.

00:16:26.910 --> 00:16:30.590
But the idea that a world
that seems perfectly

00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:32.220
benign and protective
could suddenly

00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:36.760
turn menacing and terrible, that
behind any door or window lurks

00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:40.840
some monstrosity, that
the ordinary world is just

00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:43.710
an illusion, that what you
think of as ordinary, and plain,

00:16:43.710 --> 00:16:50.410
and prosaic can suddenly erupt
in violence, or in terror,

00:16:50.410 --> 00:16:52.790
or in some form of
unpredictable assault

00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:57.050
is a constant feeling you
have in Hitchcock's films.

00:16:57.050 --> 00:17:00.890
His films dance along an edge in
which the whole of the universe

00:17:00.890 --> 00:17:03.480
could be said to be, in
some sense, endangered.

00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:07.371
The basic laws of our
experience, of even sometimes

00:17:07.371 --> 00:17:08.829
the physical laws
of our experience

00:17:08.829 --> 00:17:14.121
are upended, or denied, or
suspended in Hitchcock's world.

00:17:14.121 --> 00:17:16.329
Can you think of one example
where the laws of nature

00:17:16.329 --> 00:17:19.810
itself suddenly go cuckoo?

00:17:19.810 --> 00:17:21.256
One of his most famous films.

00:17:21.256 --> 00:17:22.089
AUDIENCE: The Birds.

00:17:22.089 --> 00:17:23.230
DAVID THORBURN: The
Birds, of course,

00:17:23.230 --> 00:17:24.000
the late film The Birds.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.300
What happens in The Birds?

00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:27.650
AUDIENCE: All the birds
start attacking [INAUDIBLE].

00:17:27.650 --> 00:17:29.983
DAVID THORBURN: Yes, the most
benign and beautiful parts

00:17:29.983 --> 00:17:33.554
of nature suddenly began
to attack human beings.

00:17:33.554 --> 00:17:35.470
He gives some partial
explanation in the film,

00:17:35.470 --> 00:17:37.928
where you see there's a scene
in a restaurant where you see

00:17:37.928 --> 00:17:39.540
pictures of fried
chicken, and people

00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:44.470
talking about how they love
roast pheasant, and so forth.

00:17:44.470 --> 00:17:46.420
But in all of
Hitchcock's films, there

00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:49.500
is never an adequate,
a truly adequate motive

00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:52.250
for the madness,
terror, disorder

00:17:52.250 --> 00:17:54.350
that is released in the movies.

00:17:54.350 --> 00:17:56.330
There's often an
attempt to explain them,

00:17:56.330 --> 00:17:58.850
but nobody takes the
explanations very seriously,

00:17:58.850 --> 00:18:00.880
because the point is,
his vision of life

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:03.560
is a vision in which the
world is an incredibly

00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:08.610
dangerous, wholly unpredictable,
monstrously fearsome place.

00:18:08.610 --> 00:18:11.530
Maybe his dominant emotion
is the emotion of fear.

00:18:11.530 --> 00:18:15.550
He dramatizes fear over and over
and over again in his movies.

00:18:15.550 --> 00:18:17.200
Here is a brief selection.

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:18.890
He made over 50
films, and I think

00:18:18.890 --> 00:18:23.480
53 total films, silent and
sound films in his career.

00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:26.800
The list I put up there is
just a very brief selection,

00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:31.270
but let me say a few
things about the trajectory

00:18:31.270 --> 00:18:36.610
of that career and then
I'll turn to a bit more

00:18:36.610 --> 00:18:40.720
about his technical genius
and about the central themes

00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:42.880
of his work, which I've
already begun to elaborate

00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:46.430
and won't repeat myself
too much, I hope.

00:18:46.430 --> 00:18:48.980
But let's talk a bit
about his career,

00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:55.570
because like Howard
Hawks and Frank Capra,

00:18:55.570 --> 00:19:01.010
Hitchcock is, even
more than those two,

00:19:01.010 --> 00:19:04.820
a dominant figure of the studio
era, maybe the dominant figure.

00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:08.560
Certainly, the director whose
work has been most influential,

00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:09.930
has lasted the longest.

00:19:09.930 --> 00:19:11.370
One of the most
interesting things

00:19:11.370 --> 00:19:13.760
about Hitchcock's
career, as a whole,

00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:17.340
is that even after film
came to be recognized

00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:19.450
as something more than
mere entertainment,

00:19:19.450 --> 00:19:22.530
Hitchcock was always admired
as a great entertainer

00:19:22.530 --> 00:19:27.181
and was a successful
director from the silent era

00:19:27.181 --> 00:19:29.180
from the time he began
to work in Great Britain.

00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:37.430
When he made his move to
the United States in 1939,

00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:40.320
he was Britain's most famous
and most admired director.

00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:42.159
In fact, when he came
to the United States,

00:19:42.159 --> 00:19:43.700
there was a kind of
negative reaction

00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:46.850
in Britain, because they
felt it was unpatriotic

00:19:46.850 --> 00:19:49.330
of this great director to
desert his native homeland

00:19:49.330 --> 00:19:52.030
in the middle of the
war, among other things.

00:19:52.030 --> 00:19:56.330
And he did feel guilt
over this, in many ways,

00:19:56.330 --> 00:19:59.010
and some of that guilt is
said, by some scholars,

00:19:59.010 --> 00:20:02.100
to express itself in some
aspects of the other film

00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:04.490
you're going to see this
evening, an earlier film,

00:20:04.490 --> 00:20:08.620
made in 1943 shortly
after Hitchcock

00:20:08.620 --> 00:20:09.870
had come to the United States.

00:20:09.870 --> 00:20:11.750
It wasn't his first
American film.

00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:13.782
While he was making
that film, he

00:20:13.782 --> 00:20:15.990
was receiving news from
England about his mother, who

00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:18.690
was very ill, and
she actually died

00:20:18.690 --> 00:20:22.960
while he was in the
United States filming

00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:24.430
Shadow of a Doubt.

00:20:24.430 --> 00:20:27.590
And there are some
scholars who say

00:20:27.590 --> 00:20:30.890
that his familial feelings,
his guilt over leaving England,

00:20:30.890 --> 00:20:33.130
his guilt about
deserting his mother

00:20:33.130 --> 00:20:36.050
come out in various ways
in Shadow of a Doubt.

00:20:36.050 --> 00:20:38.180
I'm not so sure about
that, because it's

00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:40.170
a pretty cynical,
and tough-minded,

00:20:40.170 --> 00:20:42.200
and anti-sentimental
film in its own way,

00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:44.610
but there are some elements
of family life in it

00:20:44.610 --> 00:20:51.050
that perhaps recover
or allude to aspects

00:20:51.050 --> 00:20:53.750
of Hitchcock's own career.

00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:56.200
One significant thing, as
I've already suggested,

00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:59.710
is that he was successful at
every phase in the history

00:20:59.710 --> 00:21:02.610
of movies that, like
Hawks and Capra,

00:21:02.610 --> 00:21:05.910
he began in the silent era, did
distinguished work there, moved

00:21:05.910 --> 00:21:08.170
into the sound era and
did distinguished work

00:21:08.170 --> 00:21:08.940
in the sound era.

00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:12.780
He has something else in
common with Hawks and Capra,

00:21:12.780 --> 00:21:14.480
and I only recently
discovered this.

00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:16.970
It's not as systematic as in
the case of Hawks and Capra,

00:21:16.970 --> 00:21:19.550
but he, too,
studied engineering.

00:21:19.550 --> 00:21:21.810
So there must be
something in this.

00:21:21.810 --> 00:21:24.080
You guys should
maybe reconsider what

00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:27.040
you're up to here,
because three of the most

00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:29.120
remarkable and technically
adept directors

00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:34.670
in the history of the
studio era all had

00:21:34.670 --> 00:21:36.680
partial training as engineers.

00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:42.270
So he begins in the silent
era, and in fact, let's

00:21:42.270 --> 00:21:44.050
go behind-- let me
say just a little bit

00:21:44.050 --> 00:21:45.590
about his background.

00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:47.260
He was an outsider,
in a certain way,

00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:48.634
even though he
was an Englishman,

00:21:48.634 --> 00:21:50.030
because he was a Jesuit.

00:21:50.030 --> 00:21:52.680
His parents were Catholic
in Protestant England.

00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:55.320
And he felt himself, all his
life, I think in some ways,

00:21:55.320 --> 00:22:01.650
to be a kind of outsider,
someone who didn't exactly

00:22:01.650 --> 00:22:05.760
fit in traditional society.

00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:09.460
He went to work after his
schooling in the advertising

00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:11.360
department of a
telegraph company,

00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:14.370
began to write the title
cards for silent films

00:22:14.370 --> 00:22:20.510
as early as 1921, and then began
for this telegraph company,

00:22:20.510 --> 00:22:24.460
began to work on certain
feature films that

00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:26.574
were co-produced in Germany.

00:22:26.574 --> 00:22:28.240
And this is, of course,
the great period

00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:31.990
of German Expressionism,
when the great German silent

00:22:31.990 --> 00:22:35.360
directors are creating
their science fiction

00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:37.540
and Expressionist works.

00:22:37.540 --> 00:22:39.410
And Hitchcock, in
his early life,

00:22:39.410 --> 00:22:41.650
is immersed in that
stuff, learns that stuff,

00:22:41.650 --> 00:22:44.830
goes to school in that, and
you can feel the Expressionist

00:22:44.830 --> 00:22:48.300
impulse in the darkness
and the disturbance that's

00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:53.570
a central part of almost
every Hitchcock film.

00:22:53.570 --> 00:22:58.660
He makes something like,
I think, a total of six

00:22:58.660 --> 00:23:02.430
or seven silent
films of which the--

00:23:02.430 --> 00:23:06.020
do we have the list up there,
yes-- of which the most

00:23:06.020 --> 00:23:08.310
important is-- The
Pleasure Gardens

00:23:08.310 --> 00:23:10.430
was a co-production,
the first film

00:23:10.430 --> 00:23:11.870
that he worked on
systematically,

00:23:11.870 --> 00:23:13.570
and it was a German
co-production.

00:23:13.570 --> 00:23:15.500
He wasn't the prime
director in it.

00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:16.970
The Lodger is
probably his most--

00:23:16.970 --> 00:23:20.610
almost surely his most
important and most Hitchcockian

00:23:20.610 --> 00:23:21.450
silent film.

00:23:21.450 --> 00:23:22.870
Can you guess the topic?

00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:24.750
It's Jack the Ripper.

00:23:24.750 --> 00:23:26.360
It's a silent film.

00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:29.120
It's a story about a landlady
who thinks fearfully,

00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:31.370
nervously that she may
have rented a room to Jack

00:23:31.370 --> 00:23:32.650
the Ripper, the famous killer.

00:23:32.650 --> 00:23:35.140
So he's a successful
silent director already,

00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:37.730
an admired director, makes
the transition to sound,

00:23:37.730 --> 00:23:40.040
and in fact-- historically
he'd be famous

00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:43.030
just for this one fact--
Blackmail, a British film he

00:23:43.030 --> 00:23:46.820
made in 1929, is the
first British talkie.

00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:51.680
And he almost immediately
began to figure out

00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:55.240
how to integrate-- was
very interested in all

00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:57.260
the technical aspects
of movie-making,

00:23:57.260 --> 00:24:00.530
especially interested in the way
you integrate sound with image.

00:24:00.530 --> 00:24:05.670
And as anyone who's watched
the shower scene in Psycho,

00:24:05.670 --> 00:24:09.000
for example, would
be a famous example,

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.760
anyone who's watch these
scenes like that in Hitchcock

00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:14.750
will recognize the tremendous
importance of music

00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:15.730
in his films.

00:24:15.730 --> 00:24:21.420
The way he uses music to
deepen and complicate the moods

00:24:21.420 --> 00:24:24.470
he's creating, and especially
how he can use music

00:24:24.470 --> 00:24:27.460
to enhance your sense
of terror and fear

00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:31.780
as he does in certain frenzied,
powerful scenes in his most

00:24:31.780 --> 00:24:33.420
remarkable films.

00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:37.350
And then he goes on to really
an immensely successful career

00:24:37.350 --> 00:24:40.310
as the director of action
adventure mystery films

00:24:40.310 --> 00:24:43.594
of which I've listed the most
famous and significant ones,

00:24:43.594 --> 00:24:46.010
films that are still interesting
to people, that are still

00:24:46.010 --> 00:24:49.110
watched today for their
own intrinsic excitement,

00:24:49.110 --> 00:24:52.080
even though many of them
also feel a bit old-fashioned

00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:53.700
in their behavior.

00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:56.830
The Man Who Knew Too Much,
The 39 Steps, and The Lady

00:24:56.830 --> 00:25:00.490
Vanishes, and there are other
films he made in this era,

00:25:00.490 --> 00:25:02.670
I'm only listing a
selection, as I've said.

00:25:02.670 --> 00:25:05.510
Then he makes the transition
to the United States.

00:25:05.510 --> 00:25:08.740
He's lured here
by David Selznick,

00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:11.130
the head of a great studio.

00:25:11.130 --> 00:25:13.810
Hitchcock is especially drawn
to coming to the United States

00:25:13.810 --> 00:25:17.000
because he envies the
technical resources that

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.490
are available to American
directors, who, because they

00:25:19.490 --> 00:25:23.630
have much more budget, they
can do much more when they have

00:25:23.630 --> 00:25:26.780
enough money to add cameras, and
to have adequate crews, and so

00:25:26.780 --> 00:25:27.400
forth.

00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:30.540
And the first film he
makes in the United States,

00:25:30.540 --> 00:25:33.650
Rebecca, a remake
of a famous novel,

00:25:33.650 --> 00:25:36.020
won an Academy Award as
best film of the year,

00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:41.240
although Hitchcock did not
win a director's award.

00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:43.470
But it's the least Hitchcockian
of all of his films,

00:25:43.470 --> 00:25:45.290
and perhaps he was
restraining himself

00:25:45.290 --> 00:25:49.009
a little bit in an attempt
to establish himself

00:25:49.009 --> 00:25:50.050
in the American audience.

00:25:50.050 --> 00:25:52.280
It's a very interesting
film, and you can still

00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:54.820
see that it, in some
broad way, fits Hitchcock.

00:25:54.820 --> 00:25:57.630
It's a Gothic story, the
classic English novels

00:25:57.630 --> 00:26:00.700
about governesses who
go off in the country

00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:04.910
to strange mansions, and
they are both attracted to

00:26:04.910 --> 00:26:08.720
and repelled by the handsome,
sometimes scarred stranger

00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:09.930
who runs the place, right?

00:26:09.930 --> 00:26:12.280
I'm talking especially
about what novel?

00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:15.410
Jane Eyre, Charlotte
Bronte's great novel.

00:26:15.410 --> 00:26:18.440
And of course, that pattern--
that [INAUDIBLE] that pattern

00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:20.330
repeats itself again
and again in the movies,

00:26:20.330 --> 00:26:24.040
and Rebecca is a version
of that kind of story.

00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:26.230
And then Hitchcock
goes on in the '40s

00:26:26.230 --> 00:26:29.380
to make a series of films
in which his own interest

00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:31.630
in the technology
of motion pictures

00:26:31.630 --> 00:26:34.190
and his own obsession
with setting problems

00:26:34.190 --> 00:26:36.560
for himself that are
difficult to solve,

00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:39.680
his own sort of engineer's
obsession with the technology

00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:43.050
of motion picture begins to
become clearer and clearer.

00:26:43.050 --> 00:26:46.290
Another reason that The Lodger
is an important Hitchcock film

00:26:46.290 --> 00:26:48.790
is that it's the first film in
which Hitchcock himself makes

00:26:48.790 --> 00:26:51.130
a brief cameo
appearance, and after

00:26:51.130 --> 00:26:53.800
that it becomes a kind of
signature feature of his movies

00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:56.150
that at some point in
the film, a character--

00:26:56.150 --> 00:26:58.840
Alfred Hitchcock
will appear briefly.

00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:01.390
He won't be identified, he
won't be noticed in the credits,

00:27:01.390 --> 00:27:03.790
but as he became more
and more well known,

00:27:03.790 --> 00:27:06.032
audiences began
to watch for this.

00:27:06.032 --> 00:27:07.740
This bothered him in
some way, because it

00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:11.680
meant that it distracted people
from the movies themselves,

00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:14.490
because they were waiting to
see when Hitch would emerge,

00:27:14.490 --> 00:27:17.240
so he began to do it earlier
and earlier in the films

00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:20.100
in order to avoid
distracting audiences.

00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:23.070
But think what it means,
having to devise a way for him

00:27:23.070 --> 00:27:24.180
to be in the movie.

00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:25.720
In many cases, it's easy.

00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:28.660
OK, a man's getting on a bus, so
he can be in the crowd of the--

00:27:28.660 --> 00:27:31.720
but what happens when he makes
films that are arbitrarily

00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:33.630
restricted, as he
does in some cases?

00:27:33.630 --> 00:27:37.790
For example, the film
Lifeboat, in 1944, some of you

00:27:37.790 --> 00:27:38.550
know about it.

00:27:38.550 --> 00:27:40.470
It takes place
entirely on a lifeboat.

00:27:40.470 --> 00:27:42.675
There are eight or
nine characters.

00:27:42.675 --> 00:27:44.570
They've escaped a shipwreck.

00:27:44.570 --> 00:27:47.447
It's a World War II
parable about Nazism,

00:27:47.447 --> 00:27:49.030
and they're all stuck
in the lifeboat.

00:27:49.030 --> 00:27:51.670
And for the entire
film, the film

00:27:51.670 --> 00:27:53.850
is confined to that lifeboat.

00:27:53.850 --> 00:27:56.450
It presents all kind-- it's
not one of his best films,

00:27:56.450 --> 00:27:58.120
but the technical
challenge presented

00:27:58.120 --> 00:27:59.550
is really interesting, isn't it?

00:27:59.550 --> 00:28:02.142
Vertigo was an even more
interesting instance,

00:28:02.142 --> 00:28:03.600
and a much more
successful instance

00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:06.700
of the same desire or
the same weird impulse

00:28:06.700 --> 00:28:10.070
in Hitchcock himself to
create confining situations

00:28:10.070 --> 00:28:13.905
and then see what that
confinement allows him to do,

00:28:13.905 --> 00:28:17.720
what grows out of these
arbitrary limitation.

00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:23.290
But just as a kind of minor
instance of this kind of thing,

00:28:23.290 --> 00:28:28.040
if all the characters
in Lifeboat

00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:30.200
are on a boat in the
middle of the ocean,

00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:31.820
how can Hitchcock appear?

00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:34.540
Because he's not one
of the main characters.

00:28:34.540 --> 00:28:37.036
Does anyone know how he did it?

00:28:37.036 --> 00:28:39.160
There's a newspaper lying
on the floor of the boat,

00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:41.326
and you pick up the newspaper,
and there's a picture

00:28:41.326 --> 00:28:44.310
of Hitchcock in the newspaper.

00:28:44.310 --> 00:28:46.300
It's a trivial thing,
but it [INAUDIBLE],

00:28:46.300 --> 00:28:49.130
but its triviality is exactly
what makes it so interesting.

00:28:49.130 --> 00:28:53.500
In other words, what Hitchcock
loved, this kind of problem.

00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:55.350
When he took these
problems in a serious way

00:28:55.350 --> 00:28:57.770
and when these problems
sort of led him

00:28:57.770 --> 00:29:01.120
into a kind of exploration of
our darker, and more disturbed,

00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:07.360
and more uncivilized sides,
he made remarkable films that

00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:10.270
are memorable and haunting.

00:29:10.270 --> 00:29:14.750
And one more
example of Hitchcock

00:29:14.750 --> 00:29:18.140
setting himself these
difficult technical feats.

00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:21.740
The film Rope, well
titled in a way.

00:29:21.740 --> 00:29:24.440
It's a murder mystery, but
Hitchcock set it up in a way,

00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:28.649
it's actually, such that,
it creates the illusion

00:29:28.649 --> 00:29:30.940
that the entire film-- I
don't remember how long it is.

00:29:30.940 --> 00:29:32.910
Let's say it's a standard
feature length film.

00:29:32.910 --> 00:29:34.910
Let's say it's 89 minutes long.

00:29:34.910 --> 00:29:36.640
It's a standard
feature length film.

00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:40.800
It feels as if it's all
unraveled in a single take,

00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:43.540
as if there are no cuts,
no edits in the movie.

00:29:43.540 --> 00:29:46.910
Now, it's not exactly true,
because the film was not

00:29:46.910 --> 00:29:48.600
capable, technically,
of doing that.

00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:53.200
What Hitchcock did was, he
had cassettes of film that

00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:54.600
would last, say, 10 minutes.

00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:57.080
So he would make 10-minute
long takes, but then he'd

00:29:57.080 --> 00:29:59.230
have to change the
cassette, put in a new one,

00:29:59.230 --> 00:30:01.090
but he disguised the takes.

00:30:01.090 --> 00:30:02.360
He disguised the cuts.

00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:05.890
And in fact, it's an
unbelievably tedious film,

00:30:05.890 --> 00:30:09.140
because when you're watching it,
you feel you can't look away.

00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:11.122
One of the things
that you discover

00:30:11.122 --> 00:30:13.455
when you're watching this
film is that cuts are actually

00:30:13.455 --> 00:30:14.860
a relaxation.

00:30:14.860 --> 00:30:16.970
They let you relax.

00:30:16.970 --> 00:30:18.640
They break the
rhythm in some way.

00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:22.080
And if you sit there for 89
minutes watching something that

00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:24.040
seems to be unfolding--
and film, of course,

00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:27.330
unfolds in real time,
also, therefore, right?

00:30:27.330 --> 00:30:29.200
So he's playing both
with another kind

00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:31.480
of confinement, which is
the duration of the movie.

00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:34.200
He's saying, I'm going to make
the duration of the viewing

00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:36.500
the same duration as
the action of the movie,

00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:38.095
and I'm never going
to cut, or I'm

00:30:38.095 --> 00:30:40.220
going to create the illusion
that there's not going

00:30:40.220 --> 00:30:41.797
to be a single edit in my film.

00:30:41.797 --> 00:30:43.380
When you're watching
it, you actually,

00:30:43.380 --> 00:30:45.862
yourself, feel trapped.

00:30:45.862 --> 00:30:47.570
You feel guilty if
you look away, or you,

00:30:47.570 --> 00:30:49.710
but you constantly want
to blink or look down,

00:30:49.710 --> 00:30:52.900
because it's almost as
if the absence of edits

00:30:52.900 --> 00:30:56.490
creates a kind of continuous
stream of imagery,

00:30:56.490 --> 00:30:58.810
and you feel you're trapped
within it, like a wall that

00:30:58.810 --> 00:31:00.790
doesn't let you escape from it.

00:31:00.790 --> 00:31:02.510
Well, that kind
of-- I don't know

00:31:02.510 --> 00:31:04.930
that Hitchcock actually
intended such a reaction,

00:31:04.930 --> 00:31:09.000
but is not inconsistent
with Hitchcock's desire

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:11.890
to manipulate your feelings
as you're watching a film.

00:31:11.890 --> 00:31:16.315
And he became a master at
manipulating your reactions

00:31:16.315 --> 00:31:18.520
as you watch the film.

00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:21.800
So there are many-- and I
could cite many other examples

00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:23.690
of this sort of
technical obsession,

00:31:23.690 --> 00:31:27.280
but let me just say a couple of
things about the major films.

00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:29.230
And he successfully,
in every phase,

00:31:29.230 --> 00:31:30.790
but he really
comes into his own,

00:31:30.790 --> 00:31:34.180
most folks critics would
say, at the end of the 1940s

00:31:34.180 --> 00:31:36.850
with a series of-- maybe the
early '50s-- with a series

00:31:36.850 --> 00:31:40.390
of films that run from
'51 through, maybe,

00:31:40.390 --> 00:31:42.859
most people would say
through The Birds in 1963.

00:31:42.859 --> 00:31:45.150
And I haven't listed all the
films he made in that era,

00:31:45.150 --> 00:31:47.310
but I've listed the
most important ones,

00:31:47.310 --> 00:31:51.510
and you can judge for yourself
how significant this is, why?

00:31:51.510 --> 00:31:54.550
Because look at how many
titles you recognize.

00:31:54.550 --> 00:31:57.680
How many titles by
directors so many years ago

00:31:57.680 --> 00:31:59.187
would you actually have seen?

00:31:59.187 --> 00:32:01.270
It's one measure of what
an important figure, what

00:32:01.270 --> 00:32:05.290
a successful figure Hitchcock
is that he's still so widely

00:32:05.290 --> 00:32:07.480
known, that he's more
famous today than he was

00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:08.985
when he was making his movies.

00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:14.510
As I started to say earlier, one
of the most distinctive things

00:32:14.510 --> 00:32:17.370
or interesting and revealing
things about Hitchcock's career

00:32:17.370 --> 00:32:19.890
is that through the
mass of his career,

00:32:19.890 --> 00:32:24.930
even though he was one of
the most popular directors,

00:32:24.930 --> 00:32:30.080
and his films made
money, and he was

00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:32.730
a totally bankable
director, no, maybe

00:32:32.730 --> 00:32:34.660
the most bankable
director in Hollywood

00:32:34.660 --> 00:32:38.600
during the studio era, he
didn't get much respect.

00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:41.410
Some people have suggested
that one of the reasons for it

00:32:41.410 --> 00:32:43.440
is that he gave so much
pleasure that there

00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:45.648
was a feeling that anyone
who gave this much pleasure

00:32:45.648 --> 00:32:50.460
couldn't be an artist, that
it worked against him that he

00:32:50.460 --> 00:32:52.100
was such a great entertainer.

00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:53.610
And there may be
something to that.

00:32:53.610 --> 00:32:57.030
But steadily over time, and
especially since his death,

00:32:57.030 --> 00:33:00.080
his reputation has increased,
and increased, and increased.

00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:03.330
And in fact, recently,
his film Vertigo

00:33:03.330 --> 00:33:07.450
was voted the best film
of all time, the best film

00:33:07.450 --> 00:33:10.620
ever made, displacing
Orson Welles' Citizen

00:33:10.620 --> 00:33:13.190
Kane, which had been at the
top of this list for something

00:33:13.190 --> 00:33:15.100
like 20 years.

00:33:15.100 --> 00:33:18.800
And this ascension in
which Hitchcock was sort of

00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:22.040
denigrated as a mere entertainer
to now being recognized

00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:25.360
as one of the greatest
artists in the movies

00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:28.382
of the 20th century is a
very interesting development,

00:33:28.382 --> 00:33:30.840
and it's a development that's
partly a function of the fact

00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:33.890
that all of that happened
after the movies were

00:33:33.890 --> 00:33:41.260
no longer the central narrative
experience in the modern world

00:33:41.260 --> 00:33:48.390
in which they had already
been displaced as a system.

00:33:48.390 --> 00:33:50.860
So in this period
between Strangers

00:33:50.860 --> 00:33:54.130
on a Train through
The Birds in 1963--

00:33:54.130 --> 00:33:56.590
some people might
include Marnie in '64--

00:33:56.590 --> 00:33:58.370
he made a series of
masterpieces that

00:33:58.370 --> 00:34:00.880
are among the most
significant and most powerful

00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:06.460
films ever made, two of which
we're talking about tonight.

00:34:06.460 --> 00:34:07.930
Hitchcock the technician.

00:34:07.930 --> 00:34:09.870
I've already implied
something about this,

00:34:09.870 --> 00:34:12.780
but it's worth emphasizing this.

00:34:12.780 --> 00:34:19.250
Hitchcock became famous,
especially in the industry,

00:34:19.250 --> 00:34:22.730
for the unbelievably
fastidious, almost bored way

00:34:22.730 --> 00:34:25.940
in which he carried out
his direction of a movie.

00:34:25.940 --> 00:34:28.739
By the time Hitchcock got
to the set of the film,

00:34:28.739 --> 00:34:33.449
he had so obsessively planned
out every aspect of the movie

00:34:33.449 --> 00:34:36.840
that he acted as if
everything was all finished.

00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:38.921
He often annoyed his actors.

00:34:38.921 --> 00:34:40.670
Some actors disliked
him a lot, because he

00:34:40.670 --> 00:34:44.600
gave very little
instruction to his actors,

00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:49.600
and some actors like this, but
many resented it a great deal.

00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:53.400
See, he's been quoted
a number of times

00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:57.629
as showing a kind of
disregard for actors.

00:34:57.629 --> 00:34:59.170
At one point, he
said actors are just

00:34:59.170 --> 00:35:04.110
cattle to be moved around
on the set like animals.

00:35:04.110 --> 00:35:07.832
But it was more of the fact that
the actors had trouble with him

00:35:07.832 --> 00:35:09.790
because he seemed to have
worked everything out

00:35:09.790 --> 00:35:10.850
before he got to the set.

00:35:10.850 --> 00:35:14.640
He was always tremendously calm,
he sat in his director's chair,

00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:17.880
would give directions,
and he had storyboarded--

00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:22.180
he had drawn out every single
scene and every single camera

00:35:22.180 --> 00:35:25.080
angle before he even
came to the set,

00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:27.167
so that it was as if he
had worked everything out

00:35:27.167 --> 00:35:28.250
before he reached the set.

00:35:28.250 --> 00:35:30.480
And what that meant,
of course, is that

00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:31.900
no improvisation on the set.

00:35:31.900 --> 00:35:34.640
He would be very unhappy
if people tried to deviate,

00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:37.240
never allowed people to
deviate from the plans that

00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:38.310
had been set before.

00:35:38.310 --> 00:35:42.560
This is in shocking contrast
to the way in which, let's say,

00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:46.011
a director like Jean Renoir
or sometimes Orson Welles

00:35:46.011 --> 00:35:47.510
might operate in
making their films.

00:35:47.510 --> 00:35:49.830
Quite the-- looking
for the contingent

00:35:49.830 --> 00:35:52.070
and the accidental that
happens while you're

00:35:52.070 --> 00:35:53.430
at work creatively.

00:35:53.430 --> 00:35:54.850
Hitchcock would
have none of that.

00:35:54.850 --> 00:35:58.180
Hitchcock came into the
process of directing

00:35:58.180 --> 00:36:00.590
with the film finished,
completed in his head,

00:36:00.590 --> 00:36:03.750
completely,
fastidiously blocked,

00:36:03.750 --> 00:36:07.560
angled, and so forth, and
there was no deviation from it.

00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:10.020
And he actually did often
act bored when he did it.

00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:11.680
How interesting that is.

00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:14.180
But he's also, of course,
a supreme technician

00:36:14.180 --> 00:36:16.640
of the movies, a
master of camera angle,

00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:20.870
a master of montage, a master
of the mingling of music

00:36:20.870 --> 00:36:22.930
and image, right?

00:36:22.930 --> 00:36:24.910
And you'll see
many, many examples

00:36:24.910 --> 00:36:27.730
of this in the two films we
are going to see this evening.

00:36:27.730 --> 00:36:31.280
How interesting, then, that he
is this incredibly fastidious,

00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:35.600
granular technician who plans
out every single camera angle

00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:37.100
before he comes on the set.

00:36:37.100 --> 00:36:38.130
What does this tell us?

00:36:38.130 --> 00:36:39.140
Why would he do that?

00:36:39.140 --> 00:36:40.620
What's interesting about it?

00:36:40.620 --> 00:36:43.090
What's most revealing about it?

00:36:43.090 --> 00:36:44.761
Why would someone do this?

00:36:44.761 --> 00:36:47.010
Maybe if the subject matter
you're trying to deal with

00:36:47.010 --> 00:36:49.820
is so unruly and so
frightening that the only way

00:36:49.820 --> 00:36:51.970
you could handle it
is by surrounding it

00:36:51.970 --> 00:36:55.510
with this pretense of fastidious
coherence and control.

00:36:55.510 --> 00:36:57.790
And I think that there's
no question at all

00:36:57.790 --> 00:37:00.900
that his cool demeanor,
his mocking demeanor,

00:37:00.900 --> 00:37:05.219
and especially his sense when
he comes to actually make

00:37:05.219 --> 00:37:07.260
the film, that all the
problems have been solved,

00:37:07.260 --> 00:37:08.843
that everything has
already been done,

00:37:08.843 --> 00:37:11.830
is an attempt to compensate
for or defend himself

00:37:11.830 --> 00:37:17.410
against the roiling irrational
power of the subject matter

00:37:17.410 --> 00:37:19.500
that his films mobilize.

00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:22.220
What a wonderful
revealing paradox, right?

00:37:22.220 --> 00:37:26.840
He's this fastidious
technician, but his themes

00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:29.290
are the themes of
craziness, of madness,

00:37:29.290 --> 00:37:33.290
of murder, of voyeurism,
of violence, of rape,

00:37:33.290 --> 00:37:38.930
of strangulation, of fear,
of pursuit, imprisonment,

00:37:38.930 --> 00:37:41.170
confinement, injustice.

00:37:41.170 --> 00:37:43.472
One the most interesting
things about Hitchcock,

00:37:43.472 --> 00:37:44.930
and those of you
who have seen more

00:37:44.930 --> 00:37:47.755
than two or three of his
films will feel this much

00:37:47.755 --> 00:37:50.380
more strongly than those of you
who've only seen a few of them,

00:37:50.380 --> 00:37:54.940
is how essentially passive,
deeply unaggressive,

00:37:54.940 --> 00:37:58.830
and acted upon most of
his protagonists are.

00:37:58.830 --> 00:37:59.900
They're being pursued.

00:37:59.900 --> 00:38:00.920
They're on the run.

00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:02.700
They're confined
in small places.

00:38:02.700 --> 00:38:03.940
They're full of fear.

00:38:03.940 --> 00:38:08.000
One of Hitchcock's recurring
moments, a recurring scene,

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:11.160
is the protagonist
dangling from a height.

00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:13.160
And you'll see one
magnificent instance of this

00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:15.750
at the end of Rear Window,
where Jimmy Stewart is hanging

00:38:15.750 --> 00:38:18.110
like this above a void,
and you see his face,

00:38:18.110 --> 00:38:21.450
and you can see his face
register abject fear, right?

00:38:21.450 --> 00:38:24.310
We could call that one of
Hitchcock's iconic moments.

00:38:24.310 --> 00:38:27.620
It occurs again and again in his
movies, of characters hanging

00:38:27.620 --> 00:38:31.860
over a void, terrified,
terrified of what

00:38:31.860 --> 00:38:36.100
is about to happen, and often
they fall into the void,

00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:38.690
and some of the dream
sequences in Hitchcock

00:38:38.690 --> 00:38:42.230
show us characters falling
through voids into nothingness.

00:38:42.230 --> 00:38:46.110
So the subject matter
of Hitchcock's films

00:38:46.110 --> 00:38:49.630
couldn't be more shocking
and disturbing in some sense.

00:38:49.630 --> 00:38:55.840
They mobilize problematic
subjects that are terrifying,

00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:58.697
and they obviously were
so terrifying to Hitchcock

00:38:58.697 --> 00:39:00.280
that his only way
of dealing with them

00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:05.554
was to surround them with all
this appearance of control.

00:39:05.554 --> 00:39:07.095
Another thing that
follows from this,

00:39:07.095 --> 00:39:10.040
and it's a very--
on a final point

00:39:10.040 --> 00:39:12.360
to make about Hitchcock's
films, is how often

00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:15.170
his reassuring or
happy endings don't

00:39:15.170 --> 00:39:17.499
reassure or make us happy.

00:39:17.499 --> 00:39:19.040
And the reason, of
course, is that he

00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:20.620
doesn't mean the happy endings.

00:39:20.620 --> 00:39:21.890
I'll come back to this again.

00:39:21.890 --> 00:39:26.830
But very often, even though his
films fit perfectly within--

00:39:26.830 --> 00:39:30.780
or imperfectly, but well
enough-- into the convention

00:39:30.780 --> 00:39:33.830
that the endings in
a consensus system,

00:39:33.830 --> 00:39:36.220
and the endings of these
stories have to, in some sense,

00:39:36.220 --> 00:39:39.370
restore normality
and reassure us,

00:39:39.370 --> 00:39:41.560
Hitchcock goes through
the motions of doing that,

00:39:41.560 --> 00:39:43.660
but again and again,
the endings of his films

00:39:43.660 --> 00:39:46.650
are morally ambiguous,
and provide us

00:39:46.650 --> 00:39:50.440
with kind of subtext which put
in question the reassurance

00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:55.250
that we have superficially
been offered, as if there's

00:39:55.250 --> 00:40:01.320
a level of irony, and cynicism,
and deconstructive contempt

00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:05.470
beneath, undermining
the reassurance

00:40:05.470 --> 00:40:07.460
that the endings offer us.

00:40:07.460 --> 00:40:11.210
And that's also a
part of this idea

00:40:11.210 --> 00:40:16.340
that the themes that
Hitchcock mobilizes are

00:40:16.340 --> 00:40:18.420
the dark elements
of our subconscious

00:40:18.420 --> 00:40:22.550
and of our unconscious, and
the fear that people have, fear

00:40:22.550 --> 00:40:26.520
of authority, fear of
disorder, fear of disturbance,

00:40:26.520 --> 00:40:31.950
a sense that the ordinary world
is full of menace and terror.

00:40:31.950 --> 00:40:34.010
But again and again
in Hitchcock's films,

00:40:34.010 --> 00:40:35.570
he doubles his
characters, and you'll

00:40:35.570 --> 00:40:37.460
have a good character
and an evil character,

00:40:37.460 --> 00:40:41.730
and the idea-- he grew up in
the late Victorian era of Robert

00:40:41.730 --> 00:40:44.450
Louis Stevenson, Dr.
Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,

00:40:44.450 --> 00:40:47.110
and he actually thought that was
a version of human psychology,

00:40:47.110 --> 00:40:51.270
that there's a kind of dark
or savage aspect in ourselves

00:40:51.270 --> 00:40:53.840
that's hidden or damped
down by civilization,

00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:56.320
and if we let it come out,
we could turn monstrous,

00:40:56.320 --> 00:40:58.460
we could turn horrible, right?

00:40:58.460 --> 00:41:00.660
And again and again
in Hitchcock's films,

00:41:00.660 --> 00:41:06.220
we have a kind of doubling in
which one character interacts

00:41:06.220 --> 00:41:09.580
with a more villainous
or murderous character,

00:41:09.580 --> 00:41:12.020
who we come to recognize
as a kind of double

00:41:12.020 --> 00:41:14.590
of the protagonist,
or represents

00:41:14.590 --> 00:41:17.000
the darker, more
disturbing energies

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:19.690
within the protagonist's
nature, right?

00:41:19.690 --> 00:41:22.160
And in Strangers on a
Train, what happens,

00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:24.860
a tennis star, who's having
trouble with his wife,

00:41:24.860 --> 00:41:27.290
is on a train, and a guy
pops up next to him and says,

00:41:27.290 --> 00:41:28.600
I know you're having
trouble with your wife.

00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:29.975
I read about it
in the newspaper.

00:41:29.975 --> 00:41:31.134
Let's make a deal.

00:41:31.134 --> 00:41:32.050
Nobody could track us.

00:41:32.050 --> 00:41:32.970
It'll be the perfect murder.

00:41:32.970 --> 00:41:34.303
I'm having trouble with my wife.

00:41:34.303 --> 00:41:36.340
You murder my wife
and I'll murder yours.

00:41:36.340 --> 00:41:40.194
Then the guy said, get thee
behind me, Satan, right?

00:41:40.194 --> 00:41:41.360
Don't ever talk to me again.

00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:42.540
I'm very nervous about it.

00:41:42.540 --> 00:41:45.497
A few weeks later, his
wife is murdered, right?

00:41:45.497 --> 00:41:47.580
And then he starts getting
messages from this guy,

00:41:47.580 --> 00:41:49.871
when are you going to fulfill
your part of the bargain?

00:41:49.871 --> 00:41:52.340
That's what the film is about.

00:41:52.340 --> 00:41:54.690
And it's a wonderful,
interesting movie.

00:41:54.690 --> 00:41:58.240
The scene I want you to see
now dramatizes some of this.

00:42:01.070 --> 00:42:04.060
It comes at end of the film, at
the great climax of the film,

00:42:04.060 --> 00:42:05.830
and one reason I
want you to see it

00:42:05.830 --> 00:42:09.270
is that it also shows
another aspect of his what

00:42:09.270 --> 00:42:13.930
we might call the thematic
world of Hitchcock's films,

00:42:13.930 --> 00:42:18.540
and it's his recurring interest
in the subject of entertainment

00:42:18.540 --> 00:42:19.680
itself.

00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:23.251
What he became aware of and
what his films often dramatize

00:42:23.251 --> 00:42:26.550
is the illicit and disturbing
dimension of our desire

00:42:26.550 --> 00:42:29.020
to go to the movies,
or of our desire

00:42:29.020 --> 00:42:31.170
to have the kinds
of excitements we

00:42:31.170 --> 00:42:33.000
get when we go to
amusement parks.

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:35.730
What Hitchcock understood
was that these experiences

00:42:35.730 --> 00:42:37.427
have an illicit dimension.

00:42:37.427 --> 00:42:40.010
We sit in the dark, and what do
we do when we sit in the dark?

00:42:40.010 --> 00:42:41.900
We watch people take
their clothes off.

00:42:41.900 --> 00:42:44.370
We watch them murder each other.

00:42:44.370 --> 00:42:45.120
We're in the dark.

00:42:45.120 --> 00:42:45.640
We're safe.

00:42:45.640 --> 00:42:46.181
Nobody knows.

00:42:46.181 --> 00:42:47.080
We're solitary.

00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:48.492
We're anonymous.

00:42:48.492 --> 00:42:49.450
But we're, what are we?

00:42:49.450 --> 00:42:50.710
We're voyeurs.

00:42:50.710 --> 00:42:52.750
And what he understood
was that voyeurism

00:42:52.750 --> 00:42:54.782
was at the heart of
going to the movies,

00:42:54.782 --> 00:42:56.490
was at the heart of
the movie experience,

00:42:56.490 --> 00:42:58.640
and that there-- we'll
come back to this.

00:42:58.640 --> 00:43:00.470
We'll come back to this scene.

00:43:00.470 --> 00:43:03.380
So at the end of
Strangers on a Train,

00:43:03.380 --> 00:43:06.090
there's a particularly
wonderful and dramatic example

00:43:06.090 --> 00:43:09.930
of Hitchcock looking at
the space of entertainment

00:43:09.930 --> 00:43:12.335
as a space that can turn
into an environment of menace

00:43:12.335 --> 00:43:13.750
and disturbance.

00:43:13.750 --> 00:43:16.070
And this is
character-- and again,

00:43:16.070 --> 00:43:18.532
exactly because-- remember,
I said one of his deep themes

00:43:18.532 --> 00:43:21.096
is what we might call the
menace of the ordinary.

00:43:21.096 --> 00:43:23.095
Well, what could be more
ordinary and reassuring

00:43:23.095 --> 00:43:25.510
than a child's merry-go-round?

00:43:25.510 --> 00:43:27.810
Well, here's the great
climax of Strangers

00:43:27.810 --> 00:43:31.310
on a Train in which the good
and the bad, the good and evil

00:43:31.310 --> 00:43:35.170
sides have to engage in a kind
of contest or wrestling match.

00:43:35.170 --> 00:43:36.870
And as you're
watching, note the way

00:43:36.870 --> 00:43:39.930
in which, characteristic of
Hitchcock, characteristic

00:43:39.930 --> 00:43:43.560
of him, there's a combination
of terror and comedy.

00:43:43.560 --> 00:43:46.260
He unsettles us, also,
because often the most

00:43:46.260 --> 00:43:50.820
terrifying scenes are leavened
with a kind of macabre comedy

00:43:50.820 --> 00:43:53.000
that unsettles us even more.

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:54.412
Here's the scene.

00:43:54.412 --> 00:44:02.188
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:44:02.188 --> 00:44:07.060
[MERRY-GO-ROUND MUSIC]

00:44:07.060 --> 00:44:08.320
Good guy, bad guy.

00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:09.598
He finally sees his double.

00:44:14.180 --> 00:44:16.022
These are very
helpful FBI people

00:44:16.022 --> 00:44:19.485
who do more harm than good.

00:44:19.485 --> 00:44:21.590
They shoot at the wrong
person to begin with,

00:44:21.590 --> 00:44:24.409
and they accidentally
shoot the person

00:44:24.409 --> 00:44:25.950
who's controlling
the merry-go-round,

00:44:25.950 --> 00:44:27.033
so it goes out of control.

00:44:36.155 --> 00:44:37.030
-Everyone stand back.

00:44:37.030 --> 00:44:38.512
Stand back, please.

00:44:41.970 --> 00:44:42.958
-[INAUDIBLE], sir.

00:44:42.958 --> 00:44:43.857
That's him.

00:44:43.857 --> 00:44:44.440
-He's the one.

00:44:44.440 --> 00:44:45.428
He's the one who killed him.

00:44:45.428 --> 00:44:45.922
-[INAUDIBLE].

00:44:45.922 --> 00:44:46.463
We know that.

00:44:50.455 --> 00:44:52.830
DAVID THORBURN: Part of the
comedy here is they're wrong.

00:44:52.830 --> 00:44:54.579
They don't know who
they're talking about.

00:44:54.579 --> 00:44:57.665
They have the wrong man, but
we in the audience know it.

00:45:02.504 --> 00:45:03.992
-Hey, [INAUDIBLE], stop.

00:45:03.992 --> 00:45:05.476
-Or do you want
to do it yourself?

00:45:05.476 --> 00:45:05.976
-No.

00:45:05.976 --> 00:45:07.464
I guess you could
make [INAUDIBLE].

00:45:29.784 --> 00:45:33.752
-My little boy [INAUDIBLE].

00:45:33.752 --> 00:45:36.724
My little boy.

00:45:36.724 --> 00:45:37.224
Please.

00:45:42.809 --> 00:45:44.600
DAVID THORBURN: See,
only Hitch-- Hitchcock

00:45:44.600 --> 00:45:47.870
had such confidence that he
could introduce a comic moment

00:45:47.870 --> 00:45:50.600
like that in the middle of
what is a terrifying climax.

00:45:50.600 --> 00:45:52.650
The only director who
would do that regularly.

00:45:58.530 --> 00:46:00.490
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:00.490 --> 00:46:02.450
Now you know who the
bad guy is, right?

00:46:05.410 --> 00:46:07.029
So the hero rescues the kid.

00:46:28.486 --> 00:46:29.983
[SCREAMING]

00:46:46.949 --> 00:46:49.940
Is this a montage or a
mise en scene effect?

00:46:49.940 --> 00:46:51.530
A montage effect, right?

00:46:51.530 --> 00:46:54.540
See the close up on
the animal, the way

00:46:54.540 --> 00:46:56.910
you get very-- the
camera itself doesn't

00:46:56.910 --> 00:46:59.500
allow you to sort
of look back and get

00:46:59.500 --> 00:47:01.150
a sense of the environment?

00:47:01.150 --> 00:47:04.087
Your emotions are controlled
by the tightness of the shot,

00:47:04.087 --> 00:47:05.420
by the quickness of the editing.

00:47:15.980 --> 00:47:17.640
Comic version of a hero, right?

00:47:25.660 --> 00:47:29.380
And this is
quintessential Hitchcock.

00:47:29.380 --> 00:47:29.970
Are we saved?

00:47:39.340 --> 00:47:40.080
Very helpful.

00:47:45.990 --> 00:47:47.180
All right, that's enough.

00:47:47.180 --> 00:47:48.140
You get the idea.

00:47:48.140 --> 00:47:49.290
[END PLAYBACK]

00:47:49.290 --> 00:47:52.180
And so the fact that this
space of entertainment--

00:47:52.180 --> 00:47:53.200
can you get lights up?

00:47:53.200 --> 00:47:55.390
The fact that this
space of entertainment

00:47:55.390 --> 00:47:57.960
could become a-- one more
minute, people-- could become

00:47:57.960 --> 00:48:00.330
a space of terror is the point.

00:48:00.330 --> 00:48:03.460
So finally, what would
we say about Hitchcock?

00:48:03.460 --> 00:48:05.270
He's a double man.

00:48:05.270 --> 00:48:10.820
To borrow from the great
essayist Montaigne, who said,

00:48:10.820 --> 00:48:15.480
we human beings are, I know
not how, doubling ourselves,

00:48:15.480 --> 00:48:18.910
so that what we
believe, we disbelieve,

00:48:18.910 --> 00:48:22.620
and cannot rid ourselves
of what we condemn.

00:48:22.620 --> 00:48:24.810
What Hitchcock tries
or condemn or what

00:48:24.810 --> 00:48:28.630
Hitchcock thinks he hates
keeps coming back in his films.

00:48:28.630 --> 00:48:35.060
Images of strangulation, of
damage to women, images of fear

00:48:35.060 --> 00:48:41.070
and terror in the face
of irrational authority.

00:48:41.070 --> 00:48:43.550
These themes keep
returning again and again

00:48:43.550 --> 00:48:46.270
in his film with the
power of obsession,

00:48:46.270 --> 00:48:51.700
but he controls the obsession
with that fastidious technical

00:48:51.700 --> 00:48:55.670
distance that allows these
obsessions to reach us

00:48:55.670 --> 00:48:58.920
in a way that disturbs
and enlightens.

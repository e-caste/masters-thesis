WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
Good morning,
OK.

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Let's get started.
We have one handout today.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
That's your lecture notes.
There's some copies still

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
outside for those who haven't
picked one up.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
In general, what I do is,
in the lecture notes,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
I leave out large amounts of
material.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
So, this will enable you to
keep your hands busy while I'm

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
lecturing and take down some
notes and so on.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:41.000
So, don't assume that
everything that I talk about is

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
on here.
Please follow along.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:52.000
OK, so as is my usual practice,
let me start with a quick

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000
review of what we covered so
far.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
So what we did primarily was
looked at this discipline that

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
we call the lump matter
discipline, which was very

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.000
similar, very reminiscent of the
point mass simplification in

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
physics.
And this discipline,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
this set of constraints we
imposed on ourselves,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
allowed us to move from
Maxwell's equations to a very,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
very simple form of algebraic
equations.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
And specifically,
the discipline took two forms.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:42.000
One is, we said that we will
deal with elements for whom the

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:50.000
rate of change of magnetic flux
is zero outside of the elements,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:57.000
and for whom the rate of change
of charge I want to charge

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.000
inside the element was zero.
So, if I took any element,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
any element that I called a
lump circuit element,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
like a resistor or a voltage
source, and I put a black box

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
around it, then what I'm saying
is that the net charge inside

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
that is going to be zero.
And this is not true in

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
general.
We will see examples where,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
if you choose some piece of an
element for example,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
there might be charge buildup,
but net inside the,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
if I put a box around the
entire element,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
I am going to assume that the
rate of change of charge is

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000
going to be zero.
So, what this did was it

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000
enabled us to create the lump
circuit abstraction,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000
where I could take elements,
some element of the sort,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000
this could be a resistor,
a voltage source,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
or whatever,
and I could now ascribe a

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:04.000
voltage, some voltage across an
element, and also some current,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000
"i," that was going into the
element.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
And as I go forward,
when I label the voltages and

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
currents across and through
elements, I'm going to be

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000
following a convention.
OK, the convention is that I'm

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
going to label,
if I label V in the following

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
manner, then I'm going to label
"i" for that element as a

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000
current flowing into the
positive terminal.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
It's just a convention.
By doing this,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000
it turns out that the power
consumed by the element is "vi"

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
is positive.
OK, so by choosing I going in

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
this way into the positive
terminal, the power consumed by

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
the element is going to be
positive.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000
OK, so in general of even
simply following this

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000
convention, when I label
voltages and currents,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000
I'll be labeling the current
into an element entering in

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.000
through the plus terminal.
Remember, of course,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
if the current is going this
way, let's have one amp of

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
current flowing this way,
then when I compute the

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
current, "i" will come out to be
negative.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
OK, so by making these
assumptions, the assumptions of

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
the lumped matter discipline,
I said I was able to simplify

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.000
my life tremendously.
And, in particular what it did

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.000
was it allowed me to take
Maxwell's equations,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.000
OK, and simplify them into a
very simple algebraic form,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.000
which has both a voltage law
and a current law that I call

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.000
Kirchhoff's voltage law,
and Kirchhoff's current law.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000
KVL simply states that if I
have some circuit,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:01.000
and if I measured the voltages
in any loop in the circuit,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:07.000
so if I look at the voltages in
any loop, then the voltages in

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:13.000
the loop would sum to zero.
OK, so I measure voltages in

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
the loop, and they will sum to
zero.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.000
Similarly, for the current,
if I take a node of a circuit,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000
if I build the circuit,
a node is a point in the

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000
circuit where multiple edges
connect.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
If I take a node,
then the current coming into

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.000
that node, the net current
coming into a node is going to

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
be zero.
OK, so if I take any node of

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000
the circuit and sum up all the
currents going into that node,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:51.000
they will all net sum to zero.
So, notice what I've done is by

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000
this discipline,
by this constraint I imposed on

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000
myself, I was able to make this
incredible leap from Maxwell's

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000
equations to these really,
really simple algebraic

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.000
equations, KVL and KCL.
And I promise you,

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000
going forward to the rest of
6.002, if this is all you know,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.000
you can pretty much solve any
circuit using these two very

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
simple relations.
It's actually really,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000
really simple.
It's all very simple algebra,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
OK?
So, just to show you an

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
example, let me do a little
demonstration.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000
Let me build let me build a
small circuit and measure some

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000
voltages for you,
and show you that the voltages,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.000
indeed, add up to zero.
So, here's my little circuit.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000
So, I'm going to show you a
simple circuit that looks like

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.000
this, and let's go ahead and
measure some voltages and

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
currents.
In terms of terminology to

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.000
remember, this is called a loop.
So if I start from the point C

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.000
and I travel through the voltage
source, come to the node A down

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.000
through R1 and all the way down
through R2 back to C,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
that's a loop.
Similarly, this point A is a

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
node where resistor R1 the
voltage source V0,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
and R4 are connected.
OK, just make sure your

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:04.000
terminology is correct.
So, what I'll do is I'll make

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:10.000
some quick measurements for you,
and show you that these KVL and

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.000
KCL are indeed true.
So, the circuits up there,

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.000
could I have a volunteer?
Any volunteer?

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.000
All you have to do is write
things on the board.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000
Come on over.
OK, so let me take some

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000
measurements,
and why don't you write down

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.000
what I measure on the board?
What I'll do is,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.000
let me borrow another piece of
chalk here.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:45.000
What I'll do is focus on this
loop here, and focus on this

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000
node and make some measurements.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.000
All right, so you see the
circuit up there.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:11.000
OK, so I get 3 volts for the
voltage from C to A.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:16.000
so why don't you write down 3
volts?

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:44.000
OK, so the next one is -1.6.
And so that will be,

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:50.000
I'm doing AB,
V_AB.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:10:01.000
OK, and then let me do the last
one.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:08.000
It is -1.37.
The measurements,

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:14.000
I guess, have been this way.
So, what's written is V_AC.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.000
But it's OK for now.
Don't worry about it.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:23.000
So, well, thank you.
I appreciate your help here.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.000
OK, so within the bonds of
experimental error,

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:32.000
noticed that if I add up these
three voltages,

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:38.000
they nicely sum up to zero.
OK, next let me focus on this

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
node here.
And at this node,

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
let me go ahead and measure
some currents.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:50.000
What I'll do now is change to
an AC voltage so that I can go

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:55.000
ahead and measure the current
without breaking my circuit.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.000
OK, this time around,
you'll get to see the

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:04.000
measurements that I'm taking as
well.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:09.000
So, what I have here,
I guess you can see it this

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:14.000
way.
What I have here is three wires

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:20.000
that I have pulled out from D.
And this is the node D,

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000
OK?
So, I have three wires coming

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:32.000
into the node D just to make it
a little bit easier for me to

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:37.000
measure stuff.
OK, so everybody keep your

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:42.000
fingers crossed so I don't look
like a fool here.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.000
I hope this works out.
So, you roughly get,

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
what's that,
10 mV.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:53.000
OK, so it's about 10 mV peak to
peak out there,

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:59.000
and let's say that if the
waveform raises on the left-hand

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:05.000
side, it's positive.
So, it's positive 10 mV.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
And another positive 10 mV,
so that's 20 mV.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
And this time,
it's a negative,

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
roughly 20, I guess,
-20.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.000
So, I'm getting,
in terms of currents,

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
I have a -10,
-10, I'm sorry,

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000
positive 10,
positive 10,

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:27.000
and a -20 that adds up to zero.
But more interestingly,

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.000
I can show you the same thing
by holding this current

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:37.000
measuring probe directly across
the node.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:43.000
And, notice that the net
current that is entering into

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:49.000
this node here is zero.
OK, so that should just show

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:56.000
you that KCL does indeed hold in
practice, and it is not just a

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:02.000
figment of our imaginations.
So, before I go on,

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
I wanted to point one other
thing out.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.000
Notice that I've written down
two assumptions of the lumped

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
matter discipline,
OK?

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:16.000
There is a total assumption of
the lump matter discipline,

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
and that assumption is,
in spirit, at least,

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.000
shared by the point mass
simplification in physics as

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000
well.
Can someone tell me what that

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
assumption is?
A total assumption,

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.000
which I did not mention,
which you can read in your

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.000
notes in section 8.2 in the
appendix, what's a total

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:41.000
assumption that is shared in
spirit with the point mass

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
simplification?
Anybody?

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:49.000
A total assumption to be made
here is that in all the signals

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.000
that we will study in this
course, we've made the

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:57.000
assumption that the signal
speeds of interest,

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.000
transition speeds,
and so on, are much slower than

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.000
the speed of light.
OK, that my signal transition

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:11.000
speeds of interest are much
slower than the speed of light.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000
Remember, the laws of motion,
the discrete laws of motion

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:18.000
break down if your objects begin
moving at the speed of light.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.000
OK, the same token here,
our lump circuit abstraction

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
breaks down if we approach the
speed of light.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.000
And there are follow on courses
that talk about waveguides and

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.000
other distributed analysis
techniques that deal with

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000
signals that travel close to
speeds of light.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:41.000
OK, so with that,
let me go on to talking about

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:48.000
method one of circuit analysis.
This is called the basic KVL

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:53.000
KCL method.
So just based on those two

00:14:53.000 --> 00:15:00.000
simple algebraic relations,
I can analyze very interesting

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:05.000
and complicated circuits.
The method goes as follows.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:09.000
So, let's say our goal is,
given a circuit like this,

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
our goal is to solve it.
OK, in this course,

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000
we will do two kinds of things:
analysis and synthesis.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
Analysis says,
given a circuit,

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000
OK, what can you tell me about
the circuit?

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.000
OK, so we'll solve existing
circuits for all the voltages

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
and currents,
voltages across elements,

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.000
and currents through those
elements.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
Synthesis says,
given a function,

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000
I may ask you to go and build
circuits.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:40.000
OK, so for analysis here,
we can apply this method that I

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.000
want to show you.
And the idea here is that,

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.000
given a circuit like this,
let us figure out all the

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:53.000
voltages and currents that are a
function of the way these

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:57.000
elements are connected.
So, the basic KVL and KCL

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:02.000
method has the following steps.
The first step is to write down

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:08.000
the element VI relationships.
OK, right down the element VI

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000
relationships for all the
elements.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.000
The second step is write KCL
for all the nodes,

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:19.000
and the third step is to write
KVL for all the loops in the

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.000
circuit.
That's it.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000
Just go ahead and write down
element rules,

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.000
KVL, and KCL,
and then go ahead and solve the

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
circuit.
So, what we'll do,

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:33.000
we'll do an example,
of course.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:39.000
But, just as a refresher,
we've looked at a bunch of

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.000
elements so far,
and for the resistor,

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:50.000
the element relation says that
V is pi R, where R is the

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:56.000
resistance of the element here.
For a voltage source,

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:01.000
V is equal to V nought.
That's the element

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:06.000
relationship.
And for a current source,

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:12.000
the element is the relation is,
"i" is simply the current

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:19.000
flowing through the element.
OK, so these are some of the

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:25.000
simple element rules for the
devices that the current source,

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:30.000
voltage source,
and the resistor.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.000
So let's go ahead and solve
this simple circuit.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:40.000
And what I'll do is go ahead
and solve the circuit for you.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:46.000
OK, if you turn to page five of
your notes, I'm going to go

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:53.000
ahead and edit the circuit here.
You can scribble the values on

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:58.000
your notes on page five.
OK, so as a first step of my

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:03.000
KVL KCL method,
I need to write down all my

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:08.000
element VI relationships.
So, before I do that,

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:13.000
let me go ahead and label all
the voltages and currents that

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:17.000
are unknowns in the circuit.
So, let me label the voltages

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:22.000
and currents associated with the
voltage source as here.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.000
Notice, I continue to follow
this convention where whenever I

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:31.000
label voltages and currents for
an element, I will show the

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:35.000
current going into the positive
terminal of the element

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:40.000
variable, OK,
after element variable voltage.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.000
So here, I have V nought and I
nought.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:47.000
Let me pause here for five
seconds and show you a point of

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.000
confusion that happens
sometimes.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:53.000
Often times,
people confuse between what is

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:57.000
called the variable that is
associated with the element

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:01.000
versus the element value.
OK, notice that here,

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:07.000
capital V nought is the voltage
that this voltage source

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:12.000
provides, while this name here,
v nought, is simply a variable

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:17.000
that we've used to label the
voltage across that element.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:21.000
So, similarly,
I can label v1 as the voltage

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:26.000
across the resistor,
and i1 is the current flowing

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:30.000
through the resistor.
So this method of labeling,

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:36.000
where I follow the convention,
that the current flows into the

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:44.000
positive terminal is called the
associated variables discipline.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:48.000
I was trying to use the word
discipline in situations where

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.000
you have a choice,
OK, and of a variety of

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:54.000
possible choices,
you pick one as the convention.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.000
OK, so here,
as a convention,

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:00.000
we use the associated variables
discipline, and use that method

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.000
to consistently label the
unknown voltages and currents in

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:09.000
our circuits.
OK, so let me continue the

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:13.000
labeling here,
v4, i4, i3, v3 here,

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:16.000
and v2 and i2,
v5, and i5.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:22.000
I think that's it.
So, I've gone ahead and labeled

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:27.000
all my unknowns.
So each of these voltages and

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:35.000
currents are the voltages and
currents associated with each of

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:40.000
the elements.
And my goal is to solve for

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:44.000
these.
OK, so in terms of our solution

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:49.000
here, let's follow the method
that I outlined for you.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:54.000
So, as the first step I am
simply going to go ahead and

00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:00.000
write down all the element VI
relationships.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:05.000
OK, so as a first step,
I'm going to go ahead and write

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:12.000
down all the VI relationships.
So, can someone yell out for me

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:16.000
the VI relationship for the
voltage source?

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:20.000
OK, good.
So, v0 is capital V nought,

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:25.000
that is that the variable V
nought is simply equal to the

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:29.000
voltage, v0.
Similarly, I can write the

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.000
others.
v1 is i1, R1.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:36.000
v2 is i2, R2,
and so on.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.000
OK, and I have one,
two, three, four,

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:44.000
five, six elements.
So, I will get six such

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:48.000
equations.
Step two, I'm going to go ahead

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:52.000
and write KCL for the nodes in
my system.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:57.000
So, let me start with node A.
So, for node A,

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:05.000
let me take as positive the
currents going out of the node.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:10.000
So, I get i nought flowing out,
plus i1 flowing out,

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:16.000
plus i4 flowing out,
and they must sum to zero for

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.000
node A.
Then, I can go ahead and do the

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:24.000
other nodes, let's say,
for example,

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:28.000
I do node B.
For node B, I have i2 going

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:31.000
out.
That's positive,

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:36.000
i3, and i1 is coming in,
so I get -i1 equals zero.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:39.000
OK, so I have one,
two, three, four,

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:44.000
I have four nodes.
OK, so I would get four

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:47.000
equations.
It turns out that the fourth

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:53.000
equation is not independent.
You can derive it from the

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:56.000
others.
So, I get three independent

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:01.000
equations out of this.
I can then write KVL.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:05.000
And for KVL,
I just go down my loops here.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:10.000
And let me go through this
first loop here in this manner.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:15.000
OK, and a simple trick that I
use, you have to be incredibly

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:20.000
careful when you go through this
in keeping your minuses and

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:23.000
pluses correct.
Otherwise you can get

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:26.000
hopelessly muddled.
Once you label it,

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:32.000
you need to be sure that you
get all your minuses and pluses

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.000
correct.
So, for KVL,

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:38.000
what I'd like to do is,
let's say I start at C,

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.000
and from C I'm going to go to
A.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:44.000
For A I go to B,
and from B I'm going to come

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.000
back to C.
OK, that's how I traverse my

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:49.000
loop.
And, the trick that I'm going

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:52.000
to follow is,
as my finger walks through that

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:57.000
loop, I'm going to label the
voltage as the first sign that I

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:02.000
see for that voltage.
OK, so I'm going to start with

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:05.000
C, and I go up.
I start by punching into the

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:08.000
voltage source element,
and then punch into it,

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.000
I hit the minus sign for the V
nought.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:14.000
OK, so I'm just going to write
down minus V nought,

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:18.000
plus then I go through and as I
come up to A and go down to B,

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:21.000
I punch to the plus sign of the
V1.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:24.000
So, that's plus V1.
And then I punch into the plus

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.000
sign of the V2,
and so I get plus V2,

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:30.000
and that is zero.
OK, good.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:33.000
So, that matches what you have
in your notes as well.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.000
So, this is the first equation.
Similarly, I can go through my

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:40.000
other loops and write down
equations for each of the loops.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:43.000
OK, and the convention that I
like to follow is as I go

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.000
through the loop,
I write down as a sign for the

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:49.000
voltage the first sign that I
counter for that element.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.000
OK, you can do the exact
opposite, if you want,

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:54.000
just to be different.
But, as long as you stay

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:57.000
consistent, you'll be OK.
All right, so in the same

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:00.000
manner here, there are four
loops that I can have,

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:03.000
so four equations.
Again, one of them turns out to

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:08.000
be dependent on the others.
So I end up getting three

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:12.000
independent equations.
So, I get a total of 12

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:15.000
equations.
I get 12 equations.

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:20.000
There are six elements,
OK, voltage source,

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:24.000
and five resistors.
So, there are six unknown

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:27.000
voltages, and six unknown
currents.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:33.000
So, I have 12 equations,
and 12 unknowns.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:38.000
OK, I can take all of the
equations and put them through a

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:42.000
big crank, and sit there and
grind.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:47.000
And if I was really cruel,
I'd give this as a homework

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:53.000
problem, and have you grind,
and grind, and grind until you

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:57.000
get your six voltages and six
currents.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:01.000
OK, it works.
OK, so you get 12 equations,

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:07.000
and this method just works.
However, notice that this is

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:10.000
quite a grubby method.
It's quite grungy.

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:14.000
I get 12 equations,
and it's quite a pain even for

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:18.000
a simple circuit like this.
However, suffice it to say that

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:22.000
this fundamental method is one
step away from Maxwell's

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:25.000
equations, simply works.
OK?

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:28.000
So what you'll do is the rest
of this lecture,

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:33.000
I'll introduce you to a couple
more methods.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:40.000
One is an intuitive method,
and another one called the node

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:46.000
method is a little bit more
formal, but is much more,

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:51.000
I guess, terse Than the KVL KCL
method.

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:56.000
Method 2.
So the relevant section to read

00:26:56.000 --> 00:00:02.400
in the course notes is section

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:06.000
One of the things that I will
be stressing this semester is

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.000
intuition.
What you'll find is that as you

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:11.000
become EECS majors,
and so on, and go on,

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:15.000
or if you talk to your TAs or
your professors and so on,

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:19.000
you will find that very rarely
do they actually go ahead and

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.000
apply the formal methods of
analysis.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:25.000
OK, by and large,
engineers are able to look at a

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:28.000
circuit and simply by
observation write down an

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.000
answer.
And usually in the past,

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:35.000
what we have tried to do is
kind of ignore that process and

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:37.000
told our students,
look, we teach you all the

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:40.000
formal methods,
and you will develop your own

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:44.000
intuition and be able to do it.
What we'll try to do this term

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:47.000
is try to stress the intuitive
methods, and try to show you how

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:51.000
the intuitive process goes,
so you can very quickly solve

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:54.000
many of these circuits simply by
inspection.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:57.000
OK, so this method that I'm
going to show you here is one

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:02.000
such an intuitive method.
And I'll call it element

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:08.000
combination tools.
OK, for many simple circuits,

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:14.000
you can solve them very quickly
by applying this method.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:18.000
The components of this method
are these.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:24.000
I learned about how to compose
a bunch of elements.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:27.000
So, let's say,
for example,

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:32.000
I have a set of resistors,
R1 through RN,

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:38.000
in series.
OK, you can use KVL and KCL to

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:44.000
show that this is equivalent to
a single resistor whose value is

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:48.000
given by the sum of the
resistances.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:54.000
OK, so if I have resistors in
series, then effectively it's

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:59.000
the same as if there was a
single resistor whose value is

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:07.000
the sum of all the resistances.
OK, you can look at the course

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:11.000
notes for a proof for derivation
of this fact.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:16.000
Similarly, if I have
resistances in parallel,

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:20.000
so let me call them
conductances.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:24.000
A conductance is the reciprocal
of a resistance.

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:31.000
If resistance is measured in
ohms, conductance is measured in

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:36.000
mhos, M-H-O-S.
OK, so that's the conductance

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:39.000
is G1, G2, and G3.
And effectively,

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:44.000
this is the same as having a
single conductance whose

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:49.000
effective value is given by the
sum of the conductances.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:53.000
OK, the conductances in
parallel add,

00:29:53.000 --> 00:30:00.000
and resistances in series add.
Similarly, for voltage sources,

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:06.000
if I have voltage sources in
series, then they are tantamount

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:10.000
to the sum of the voltages.
And similarly,

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:14.000
for currents,
if I have currents in parallel,

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:19.000
then they can be viewed as a
single current source,

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:24.000
whose currents are the sum of
the individual parallel

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:30.000
currents.
So, let's do a quick example.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:36.000
So let's do this example.
So, let's say I have a circuit

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:41.000
that looks like this,
and three resistances.

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:47.000
And let's say all I care about
is the current,

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:50.000
I, that flows through this
wire.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:54.000
All I care about is that
current.

00:30:54.000 --> 00:31:02.000
Of course, you can go ahead and
write KVL and KCL.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:06.000
You will get four equations,
and there are four unknowns.

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:09.000
And you can solve it.
But, I can apply my element

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:12.000
combination rules,
and very quickly figure out

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:16.000
what the current I is,
using the following technique.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:19.000
So, what I can do is,
I can, first of all,

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:23.000
take this circuit.
And, I can compose these two

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:27.000
resistances and show that the
circuit is equivalent as far as

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:30.000
this current,
I, is concerned to the

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:33.000
following circuit,
R1.

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:39.000
And I take the sum of the two
conductances,

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:46.000
OK, and that comes out to be
R1, R2, R3, R2 plus R3.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:54.000
And then, I can further
simplify it, and I get a single

00:31:54.000 --> 00:32:01.000
resistance, whose value is given
by R1 plus R2,

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:06.000
R3, R3.
OK, I'm just simplifying the

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.000
circuit.
Now, from this circuit,

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:11.000
I can get the answer that I
need.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:15.000
I is simply the voltage,
V, divided by R1 plus.

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:20.000
OK, so in situations like this
where I'm looking for a single

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:25.000
current, I can very quickly get
to the answer by applying some

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:28.000
of these element combination
rules.

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:34.000
And, I can get rid of having to
go through formal steps.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.000
So, in general,
whenever you encounter a

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:41.000
circuit, by and large attempt to
use intuitive methods to solve

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:43.000
it.
And go to a formal method only

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:47.000
if some intuitive method fails.
Even in your homework,

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:51.000
by and large,
the homeworks are not meant to

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:54.000
be grungy.
OK, if you find a lot of grunge

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:57.000
in your homework,
just remember you're probably

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:04.000
not using some intuitive method.
OK, so just be cautious.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:11.000
All right, so let me go on to
the third method of circuit

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:19.000
analysis, and the third method
is called the node method.

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:28.000
So, the node method is simply a
specific application of the KVL

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:36.000
KCL method and results in a
much, much more compact form of

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:42.000
the final equations.
If there's one method that you

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:46.000
have to remember for life,
then I would say just remember

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.000
this method.
OK, the node method is a

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.000
workhorse of the easiest
industry.

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:55.000
OK, if there's one method that
you want to consistently apply,

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:58.000
then this is the one to
remember.

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:01.000
So, let me quickly outline for
you to method,

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:04.000
and then work out an example
for you.

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:09.000
The first step of the node
method will be to select a

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:14.000
reference or a ground node.
This is the symbol for a ground

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:16.000
node.
The ground node simply says

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:21.000
that I'm going to denote
voltages at that point to be

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:26.000
zero, and measure all my other
voltages with reference to that

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:30.000
point.
So, I'm going to select a

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:36.000
ground node in my circuit.
Second, I want to label the

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:41.000
remaining voltages with respect
to the ground node.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:48.000
So, label voltages for all the
other nodes with respect to the

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:52.000
ground node.
Next, write KCL for each of the

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:57.000
nodes write KCL.
OK, but don't write KCL for the

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:02.000
ground node.
Remember, if you have N nodes,

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:07.000
the node equations will give
you N-1 independent equations.

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:12.000
So, write KCL for the nodes,
but don't do so for the ground

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:15.000
node.
Then, solve for the node

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:18.000
voltages.
So, let's say when we label

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:21.000
voltages.
I want to be labeling them as E

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:26.000
something or the other.
So, solve for the unknown node

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:31.000
voltages.
And then, once I know all the

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:37.000
voltages associated with the
nodes, I can then back solve for

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:41.000
all the branch voltages and
currents.

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:47.000
OK, once I know all the node
voltages, I can then go ahead

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:52.000
and figure out all the branch
voltages and the branch

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:56.000
currents.
So, let's go ahead and apply

00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:02.000
this method, and work out an
example.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:05.000
Again, remember,
if there's one method that you

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:08.000
should remember,
it's the node method.

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:11.000
OK, and when in doubt,
consistently apply the node

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:15.000
method and it will work whether
your circuit is linear or

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:20.000
nonlinear, if the resistors are
built in the US or the USSR it

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:23.000
doesn't matter.
OK, the node method will simply

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:26.000
work, linear or nonlinear,
OK?

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:30.000
So, what I'm going to do is I'm
going to build a circuit that's

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:36.000
my old faithful.
It's our old faithful,

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:45.000
plus I'll make it a little bit
more complicated by adding in

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:52.000
the current source.
So, let's go have some fun.

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:59.000
Let's do this.
So here's my voltage source,

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:04.000
as before.
OK, what I'll do is for fun,

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:13.000
add a current source out there.
And, you can convince

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:20.000
yourselves that if you go ahead
and apply the KVL KCL method,

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:25.000
it'll really be a mess of
equations.

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:28.000
OK, so R1, R3,
R4, R2, R5.

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:36.000
OK, so let's follow our method
and just plug and chug here.

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:39.000
So let's apply the first step.
I select a ground node.

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:42.000
It's a reference node from
which I'll measure all my other

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:44.000
voltages.
OK, now without knowing

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:48.000
anything about the node method,
try to use intuition as to

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:51.000
which node you should choose as
a ground node.

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:55.000
Remember, you want to label the
ground node with the voltage

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:58.000
zero, and measure all the other
voltages with respect to that

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:02.000
node.
OK, a usual trick is to pick a

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:07.000
node which has the largest
number of elements connected to

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:11.000
it as the ground node.
OK, and in particular,

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:16.000
you will find out later it's
useful to pick a node in which

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:20.000
all your voltage sources,
the maximum number of your

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:23.000
voltage sources are also
connected.

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:27.000
OK, so in this instance,
I'm going to choose this as my

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:32.000
ground node.
OK, that's my first step.

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:38.000
I chose that as my ground node.
And I'm going to label that as

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:41.000
having a voltage zero.
Second step,

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:47.000
I'll label voltages of the
other branches with respect to

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:52.000
the ground node.
OK, so what I'll do is add this

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:55.000
node here.
So I'm going to label that

00:38:55.000 --> 00:39:00.000
voltage E1.
These are my unknowns.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:05.000
Remember, node method,
because my node voltages are my

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:09.000
unknowns.
So, I label this as E1.

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:14.000
I label this one as my unknown
voltage, E2.

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:19.000
What about this one here?
Is that voltage unknown?

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:23.000
No.
I know what the voltage is

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:28.000
because I know that this node is
at a voltage,

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:33.000
V0, higher than the ground
node.

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:38.000
OK, notice that to go from here
to here, I directly go through a

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:42.000
voltage source.
And so, this node has voltage

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:45.000
V0.
And I'll simply write down V0.

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:50.000
OK, try to simplify the number
of steps that you have to go

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:55.000
through, so directly go ahead
and write down the voltage,

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:58.000
V0, for that node.
What I will also do,

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:02.000
is for convenience,
I'm going to write down,

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:08.000
I'm going to use conductances.
So I'm going to use GI in the

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:12.000
place of one by RI,
and write down a bunch of node

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:14.000
equations.
OK, so step one,

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:19.000
I've chosen my ground node.
Step two, I've labeled my node

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:23.000
voltages, E, OK?
I've done that with two of my

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:27.000
steps.
Now, let me go ahead and --

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:44.000
OK, so let me go ahead and
apply step three.

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:50.000
And, step three says go ahead
and apply KCL for each of the

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:54.000
nodes at which you have an
unknown node voltage.

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:59.000
And then that will give you
your equations.

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:02.000
So let me start by applying KCL
at E1.

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:06.000
So, let me write KCL at E1.
I do one more thing.

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:09.000
Notice, I don't have any
currents there.

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:14.000
OK, so how do I write KCL?
KCL simply says the sum of

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:18.000
currents into a node is zero
again, remember,

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:23.000
by the lump matter discipline.
So, if I don't have currents in

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:28.000
there, so the trick that I adopt
is that to write KCL,

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:34.000
I use the node voltages,
and implicitly substitute for

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:37.000
the node voltages,
divide by the elemental the

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:41.000
resistance, for instance,
so I take the node voltages,

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:44.000
and divide by the resistance,
get the current.

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:48.000
OK, so I implicitly apply
element relationships to get the

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:51.000
node currents.
So, the example that make it

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:55.000
clear, so I take node E1 and,
again, for currents going out

00:41:55.000 --> 00:42:00.000
I'm going to assume to have,
to be positive.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:05.000
So, the current going up is E1
minus V nought,

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:09.000
divide by R1,
so I multiplied by the G1.

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:16.000
That's the current going up.
Plus, the current going down is

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:22.000
E1 minus zero where the ground
node potential is zero,

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:28.000
G2, OK, plus the current that
is going to resistor R3,

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:35.000
which is simply E1 minus E2,
divide by R3.

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:37.000
So, E1 minus E2,
divide by R3,

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:40.000
or multiplied by G3 is equal to
zero.

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:44.000
OK, see how I got this?
This is simply KCL,

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:49.000
but to get my currents,
I simply take the differences

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:54.000
of voltages across elements,
and divide by the element of

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:58.000
resistance, and I get the
currents.

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:01.000
OK, so I can similarly write
KCL at E2.

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:06.000
So, at KCL at E2,
again, let me go outwards.

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:14.000
So, the current going up is E2
minus V nought multiplied by G4.

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:22.000
The current going left is E2
minus E1 divided by R3 or

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:29.000
multiplied by G3.
The current going down is E2

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:37.000
minus zero multiplied by G5.
And, the current going down is

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:40.000
-I1.
OK, you've got to be careful

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:46.000
with your polarities here.
So all the currents going out

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:50.000
sum to zero.
And here are the currents that

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:56.000
are going out at this point.
So what I do next is I can move

00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:01.000
the constant terms to the
left-hand side and collect my

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:07.000
unknowns.
So, let me write them out here.

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:14.000
So, let's say I get E1 here,
OK, and from this equation,

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:20.000
I have a V nought,
G1, which comes out here.

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:26.000
So, minus V nought G1 comes
over to the other side.

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:34.000
And, let me collect all the
values that multiply E1.

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:39.000
So I get, G1 is one example.
I have G2, and I have G3.

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:43.000
And then, for E2,
I have minus G3.

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:49.000
OK, so I'll simply express this
as the element voltages

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:55.000
multiplied by some terms in
parentheses, and I put my

00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:59.000
external sources on the right
hand side.

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:06.000
Similarly, I go ahead and do
the same thing here.

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:10.000
In this instance,
let me move my sources to the

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:13.000
right.
So, I get I1 coming out there,

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:16.000
and I get V nought G4 coming
out there.

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:21.000
By the way, I just want to
mention to you that if you're

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:25.000
looking to fall asleep,
this is a good time to do so

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:30.000
because as soon as I write down
these two equations,

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:36.000
OK, from now on it's nap time.
There's nothing new that you're

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:40.000
going to learn from here on.
It's just Anant Agarwal having

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:43.000
fun at the blackboard,
pushing symbols around.

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:46.000
So, once you write down these
two node equations,

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:48.000
the rest of it is just grubby
math.

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:52.000
So, let me just have some fun.
So let me just go ahead and do

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:54.000
that.
So, I moved my voltages and

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:58.000
currents to the other side.
And let me collect all the

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:01.000
coefficients for E1 here.
So, E1 minus G3,

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:04.000
and that's it,
I guess.

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:08.000
OK, and then I'll do the same
for E2.

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:12.000
So, I get G4,
and I get G3,

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:18.000
and I get G5.
OK, so notice here that I have

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:22.000
two equations,
and two unknowns.

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:29.000
OK, the two equations are on
the right hand side,

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:35.000
I have some voltages and
currents which are my dry

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:43.000
voltages and dry currents.
OK, so actually this is getting

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:46.000
quite boring.
I'm going to pause here,

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:52.000
and talk about something else.
So, you can take this and you

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:56.000
can put it in matrix form,
so I've done that for you on

00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:00.000
page ten.
It's all matrix form.

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:03.000
Yeah, I know that.
You can use any technique to

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:07.000
solve it, use algebraic
techniques, use linear algebraic

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:09.000
methods to solve it,
use a computer,

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:11.000
whatever you want.
And, computers,

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:15.000
when computers analyze
circuits, they write down these

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:18.000
equations, and deal with solving
matrices.

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:21.000
So, when you take the linear
algebra across,

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:25.000
how many people here have taken
a linear algebra class?

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:30.000
How many people here have heard
of Gaussian elimination?

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:34.000
How can more people have heard
of Gaussian elimination than

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:37.000
took a linear algebra class?
Well anyway,

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:42.000
so now you know why you took
those linear algebra classes.

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:47.000
And so, if I just collected
these into matrix form --

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:09.000
OK, so I just simply expressed
those two equations in linear

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:12.000
algebraic form,
and here's my column vector of

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:15.000
unknowns, and you can apply any
of the techniques you've learned

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:17.000
in linear algebra to solve for
this.

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:20.000
Gaussian elimination works.
OK, and in computer,

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:23.000
people doing research in
computer techniques,

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:26.000
or solving such equations
simply deals with huge equations

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:28.000
like this, building computer
programs that,

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:33.000
given equations like this,
can go ahead and solve them.

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:36.000
OK, so let me stop here and
reemphasize that what you've

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:39.000
done is made a huge leap from
Maxwell's equations to using the

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:43.000
lump matter discipline to KVL
and KCL, which ended up giving a

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:46.000
simple algebraic equation to
solve, and not having to worry

00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:49.000
about partial differential
equations that were the form of

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:52.000
Maxwell's equations.

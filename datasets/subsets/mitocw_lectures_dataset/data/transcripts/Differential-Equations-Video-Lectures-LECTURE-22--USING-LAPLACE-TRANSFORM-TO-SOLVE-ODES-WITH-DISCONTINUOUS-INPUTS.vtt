00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Today we are going to do a last
serious topic on the Laplace

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
transform, the last topic for
which I don't have to make

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
frequent and profuse apologies.
One of the things the Laplace

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000
transform does very well and one
of the reasons why people like

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
it, engineers like it,
is that it handles functions

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
with jump discontinuities very
nicely.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Now, the OR function with a
jump discontinuity is-- Purple.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Is a function called the unit
step function.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000
I will draw a graph of it.
Even the graph is

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000
controversial,
but everyone is agreed that it

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.000
zero here and one there.
What people are not agreed upon

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.000
is its value at zero.
And some people make it zero,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000
some people make it one,
and some equivocate like me.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.000
I will leave it undefined.
It is u of t.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.000
It is called the unit step.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Because that is what it is.
And let's say we will leave u

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.000
of zero undefined.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.000
If that makes you unhappy,
get over it.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Of course, we don't always want
the jump to be at zero.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Sometimes we will want to jump
in another place.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.000
If I want the function to jump,
let's say at the point a

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.000
instead of jumping at zero,
I am going to start doing what

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.000
everybody does.
You put in the vertical lines,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.000
even though I have no meaning,
whatever, but it makes the

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:21.000
graph look more connected and a
little easier to read.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.000
So that function I will call u
sub a is the function

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.000
which jumps at the point a.
How shall I give its

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.000
definition?
Well, you can see it is just

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.000
the translation by a of the unit
step function.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.000
So that is the way to write it,
u of t minus a.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Now I am not done.
There is a unit box function,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.000
which we will draw in general
terms like this.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.000
It gets to a,
then it jumps up to one,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.000
falls down again at b and
continues onto zero.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.000
This happens between a and b.
And the value to which it

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:10.000
arises is one.
I will call this the unit box.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.000
It is a function of t,
a very simple one but an

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.000
important one.
And what would be the formula

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:29.000
for the unit box function?
Well, in general,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:32.000
almost all of these functions,
as you will see when you use

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.000
jump discontinuity,
the idea is to write them all

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.000
cleverly using nothing but u of.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:43.000
Because it is that will have
the Laplace transformer.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:47.000
The way to write this is (u)ab.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:49.000
And, if you like,
you can treat this as the

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:53.000
definition of it.
Let's make it a definition.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:56.000
Okay, three lines.
Or, better yet,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:59.000
a colon and two lines.
I am defining this to be,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:03.000
what would it be?
Make the unit step at a step up

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:08.000
at a, but then I would continue
at one all the time.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:13.000
I should, therefore,
step down at b.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:16.000
Now, the way you step down is
just by taking the negative of

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:21.000
the unit step function.
I step down at b by subtracting

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:26.000
u sub b of t .
In other words,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:30.000
it is u of t minus a minus u of
t minus b.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:35.000
And now I have expressed it

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:38.000
entirely in terms of the unit
step function.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:41.000
That will be convenient when I
want take the Laplace transform.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:45.000
What is so good about these
things?

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:47.000
Well, these functions,
when you use them in

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:49.000
multiplications,
they transform other functions

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:52.000
in a nice way.
Not transform.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:54.000
That is not the right word.
They operate on them.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:57.000
They turn them into other
strange creatures,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:59.000
and it might be these strange
creatures that you are

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:02.000
interested in.
Let me just draw you a picture.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:07.000
That will be good enough.
Suppose we have some function

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:13.000
like that, f of t,
what would the function u sub

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:18.000
ab,
I will put in the variable,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:22.000
t times f of t,
what function would that be?

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:27.000
I am just going to draw its
graph.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:30.000
What would its graph be?
Well, in between a and b this

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:36.000
function (u)ab of t has the
value one.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:40.000
All I am doing is multiplying f
of t by one.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:45.000
In short, I am not doing
anything to it at all.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:49.000
Outside of that interval,
(u)ab has the value zero,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:53.000
so that zero times f of t makes
zero.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:57.000
And, therefore,
outside of this it is zero.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:01.000
The effect of multiplying an
arbitrary function by this unit

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:06.000
box function is,
you wipe away all of its graph

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:09.000
except the part between a and b.
Now, that is a very useful

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:16.000
thing to be able to do.
Well, that is enough of that.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:20.000
Now, let's get into the main
topic.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:23.000
That is just preliminary.
I will be using these functions

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:28.000
all during the period,
but the real topic is the

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:31.000
following.
Let's calculate the Laplace

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:35.000
transform of the unit step
function.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:39.000
Well, this is no very big deal.
It is the integral from zero to

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:44.000
infinity e to the minus s t
times y of t, dt.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:51.000
But, look, when t is bigger
than zero,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:55.000
this has the value one.
So it is the same of the

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:59.000
Laplace transform of one.
In other words,

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:02.000
it is one over s for
positive values of s.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:08.000
Or, to make it very clear,
the Laplace transform of one is

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:12.000
exactly the same thing.
As you see, the Laplace

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:15.000
transform really is not
interested in what happens when

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:19.000
t is less than zero
because that is not part of the

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:23.000
domain of integration,
the interval of integration.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:27.000
That is fine.
They both have Laplace

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:30.000
transform of one over s.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:32.000
What is the big deal?
The big deal is,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:36.000
what is the inverse Laplace
transform of one over s?

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:43.000
Will the real function please

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:47.000
stand up?
Which of these two should I

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:51.000
pick?
Up to now in the course we have

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:55.000
been picking one just because I
never made a fuss over it and

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:02.000
one was good enough.
For today one is no longer

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:07.000
going to be good enough.
And we have to first

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:11.000
investigate the thing in a
slightly more theoretical way

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:15.000
because this problem,
I have illustrated it on the

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:19.000
inverse Laplace transform of one
over x,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:23.000
but it occurs for any inverse
Laplace transform.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:26.000
Suppose I have,
in other words,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:29.000
that a function f of t has as
its Laplace transform capital F

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:33.000
of s?
And now, I ask what the inverse

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:38.000
Laplace transform of capital F
of s is.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:43.000
Well, of course you want to
write f of t.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:47.000
But the same thing happens.
I will draw you a picture.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:51.000
Suppose, in other words,
that here is our function f of

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:56.000
t.
Well, one answer certainly is f

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:59.000
of t.
That is okay.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:00.000
That is the answer we have been
using up until now.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:06.000
But, you see,
I can complete this function in

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:10.000
many other ways.
Suppose I haven't told you what

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:14.000
it was for s less than zero.
Any of these possibilities all

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:20.000
will produce the same Laplace
transform.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:23.000
In fact, I can even make it
this.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:26.000
That is okay.
Each of these,

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:29.000
f of t with any one of
these tails, all have the same

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:34.000
Laplace transform.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:43.000
Because the Laplace transform,
remember the definition,

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:47.000
integral zero to infinity,
e to the negative s t,

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:50.000
f of t, dt

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:55.000
because the Laplace transform
does not care what the function

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:59.000
was doing for negative values of
t.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:02.000
Now, if we have to have a
unique answer --

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:06.000
And most of the time you don't
because, in general,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:09.000
the Laplace transform is only
used for problems for future

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:13.000
time.
That is the way the engineers

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:15.000
and physicists and other people
who use it habitually think of

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:19.000
it.
If your problem is starting now

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:21.000
and going on into the future and
you don't have to know anything

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:26.000
about the past,
that is a Laplace transform

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:29.000
problem.
If you also have to know about

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:31.000
the past, then it is a Fourier
transform problem.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:36.000
That is beyond the scope of
this course, you will never hear

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:40.000
that word again,
but that is the difference.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:43.000
We are starting at time zero
and going forward.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:47.000
All right.
It does not care what f of t

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:50.000
was doing for negative values of
t.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:52.000
And that gives us a problem
when we try to make the Laplace

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:57.000
transform unique.
Now, how will I make it unique?

00:10:54.000 --> 00:11:00.000
Well, there is a simple way of
doing it.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:05.000
Let's agree that wherever it
makes a difference,

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:08.000
and most of the time it
doesn't, but today it will,

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:12.000
whenever it makes a difference
we will declare,

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:15.000
we will by brute force make our
function zero for negative

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:20.000
values of t.
That makes it unique.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:22.000
I am going to say that to make
it unique, now,

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:26.000
how do I make f of t zero
for negative values

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:30.000
of t?
The answer is multiply it by

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:33.000
the unit step function.
That leaves it what it was.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:38.000
It multiplies it by one for
positive values but multiplies

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:43.000
it by zero for negative values.
The answer is going to be u of

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:48.000
t times f of t.
That will be the function that

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:54.000
will look just that way that I
drew, but I will draw it once

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:59.000
more.
It is the function that looks

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:02.000
like this.
And when I do this,

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:04.000
it makes the inverse Laplace
transform unique.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:10.000
Out of all the possible tails I
might have put on f of t,

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:14.000
it picks the least
interesting one,

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:17.000
the tail zero.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:29.000
That is a start.
But what we have to do now is

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:32.000
--

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:41.000
What I want is a formula.
What we are going to need is,

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:44.000
as you see right even in the
beginning, if for example,

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:48.000
if I want to calculate the
Laplace transform of this,

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:52.000
what I would like to have is a
nice Laplace transform for the

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:56.000
translate.
If you translate a function,

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:58.000
how does that effect this
Laplace transform?

00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:01.000
In other words,
the formula I am looking for is

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:04.000
--

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:14.000
I want to express the Laplace
transform of f of t minus a.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:18.000
In other words,

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:21.000
the function translated,
let's say a is positive,

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:25.000
so I translate it to the right
along the t axis by the distance

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:31.000
a.
I want a formula for this in

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:33.000
terms of the Laplace transform
of the function I started with.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:40.000
Now, my first task is to
convince you that,

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:43.000
though this would be very
useful and interesting,

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:46.000
there cannot possibly be such a
formula.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:49.000
There is no such formula.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:02.000
Why not?
Well, I think I will explain it

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:05.000
over there since there is a
little piece of board I did not

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:11.000
use.
Waste not want not.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:13.000
Why can't there be such a
formula?

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:16.000
What is it we are looking for?
Let's take a nice average

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:21.000
function f of t.
It has a Laplace transform.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:26.000
And now I am going to translate
it.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:29.000
Let's say this is the point
negative a.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:35.000
And so the corresponding point
positive a will be around here.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:40.000
I am going to translate it to
the right by a.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:44.000
What is it going to look like?
Well, then it is going to start

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:49.000
here and is going to look like
this dashy thing.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:54.000
That is f of t minus a.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:57.000
That is not too bad a picture.
It will do.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:00.000
I just took that curve and
shoved it to the right by a.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:07.000
Now, why is it impossible to
express the Laplace transform of

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:15.000
the dashed line in terms of the
Laplace transform of the solid

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:24.000
line?
The answer is this piece.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:29.000
I will write it this way.
The trouble is,

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:34.000
this piece is not used for the
Laplace transform of f of t.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:43.000
Why isn't it used?

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:47.000
Well, because it occurs to the
left of the vertical axis.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:50.000
It occurs for negative values
of t.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:53.000
And the Laplace transform of f
of t simply does not

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:57.000
care what f of t was
doing to the left of that line,

00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:01.000
for negative values of t.
It does not enter into the

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:04.000
integral.
It was not used when I

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:07.000
calculated this piece of the
curve.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:10.000
It was not used when I
calculated the Laplace transform

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:13.000
of f of t.
On the other hand,

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:16.000
it is going to be needed.
It occurs here,

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:19.000
after I shift it to the right.
It is going to be needed for

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:23.000
the Laplace transform of f of t
minus a,

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:27.000
because I will have to start
the integration here,

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:31.000
and I will have to know what
that is.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:40.000
In other words,
when I took the Laplace

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:43.000
transform, I automatically lost
all information about the

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:47.000
function for negative values of
t.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:50.000
If I am later going to want
some of that information for

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:54.000
calculating this,
I won't have it and,

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:57.000
therefore, there cannot be a
formula expressing one in terms

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:02.000
of the other.
Now, of course,

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:05.000
that cannot be the answer,
otherwise I would not have

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:08.000
raised your expectations merely
to dash them.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:11.000
I don't want to do that,
of course.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:13.000
There is a formula,
of course.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:15.000
It is just, I want to emphasize
that you must write it my way

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:19.000
because, if you write it any
other way, you are going to get

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:23.000
into the deepest trouble.
The formula is-- the good

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:27.000
formula, the right formula --

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:36.000
-- accepts the given.
It says look,

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:38.000
we have lost that pink part of
it.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:41.000
Therefore, I can never recover
that.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:43.000
Therefore, I won't ask for it.
The translation formula I will

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:48.000
ask for is not one for the
Laplace transform of f of t

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:52.000
minus a,
but rather for the Laplace

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:56.000
transform of this thing where I
have wiped away that pink part

00:17:54.000 --> 00:18:00.000
from the translated function.
In other words,

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:05.000
the function I am talking about
now is the formula for,

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:10.000
I will put it over here to show
you the function what we are

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:16.000
talking about.
It is the function f of,

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:19.000
well, in terms of the pink
function it is,

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:23.000
I will have to reproduce some
of that picture.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:27.000
There is f of t.
f of t minus a,

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:32.000
then, looked like this.
And so the function I am

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:38.000
looking for is,
this is the thing translated,

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:42.000
but when I get down to the
corresponding,

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:45.000
this is the point that
corresponds to that one,

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:49.000
I wipe it away and just go with
zero after that.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:54.000
So this is u of t minus a times
f of t minus a times f of t

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:59.000
minus a.
What is this Laplace transform?

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:06.000
Now that does have a simple
answer.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:10.000
The answer is it is e to the
minus as,

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:16.000
a funny exponential,
times the Laplace transform of

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:22.000
the original function.
Now, this formula occurs in two

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:29.000
forms.
This one is not too bad

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:32.000
looking.
The trouble is,

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:35.000
when you want to solve
differential equations you are

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:39.000
going to be extremely puzzled
because the function that you

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:43.000
will have to take to do the
calculation on will not be given

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:47.000
to you in the form f of t minus
a.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:50.000
It will look sine t
or t squared or some

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:54.000
polynomial in t.
It will not be written as t

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:56.000
minus a.
What do you do?

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:59.000
If your function does not look
like that but instead,

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:02.000
in terms of symbols looks like
this, you can still use the

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:06.000
formula.
Just a trivial change of

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:09.000
variable means that you can
write it instead.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:12.000
Now, this is one place,
there is no way of writing the

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:16.000
answer in terms of capital F of
s.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:19.000
This is one of those cases
where this notation is just no

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:23.000
good anymore.
I am going to have to write it

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:26.000
using the L notation.
The Laplace transform of f of,

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:30.000
and wherever you see a t,
you should write t plus a.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:34.000
Basically, this is the same

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:37.000
formula as that one.
But I will have to stand on my

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:41.000
head for one minute to try to
convince you of it.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:44.000
I won't do that now.
I would like you just to take a

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:48.000
look at the formula.
You should know what it is

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:51.000
called.
There are a certain number of

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:54.000
idiots who call this the
exponential shift formula

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:57.000
because on the right side you
multiply by an exponential,

00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:01.000
and that corresponds to
shifting the function.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:06.000
Unfortunately,
we have preempted that.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:08.000
We are not going to call it
this.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:11.000
I will call it what your book
calls it.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:14.000
The difficulty is there is no
universal designation for this

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:19.000
formula, important as it is.
However, your book calls this

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:23.000
t-axis translation formula.
Translation because I am

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:27.000
translating on the t-axis.
And that is what I do to the

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:31.000
function, essentially.
And this tells me what its new

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:36.000
Laplace transform is.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:44.000
The other formula,
remember it?

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:46.000
The exponential shift formula,
the shift or the translation

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:50.000
occurs on the s-axis.
In other words,

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:53.000
the formula said that F of s
minus a,

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:57.000
you do the translation in s
variable corresponded to

00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:01.000
multiplying this by e
to the a t.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:06.000
In other words,
the formulas are sort of dual

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:08.000
to each other.
This guy translates on the left

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:11.000
side and multiplies by the
exponential on the right.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:14.000
The formula that you know
translates on the right and

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:18.000
multiplies by the exponential on
the left.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:20.000
What are we going to calculate?
I am trying to calculate,

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:24.000
so I am trying to prove this
first formula.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:26.000
The second one will be an easy
consequence.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:29.000
I am trying to calculate the
Laplace transform of that thing.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:33.000
What is it?
Well, it is the integral from

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:37.000
zero to infinity of e to the
minus st times u of t minus a,

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:41.000
f of t minus a times dt.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:48.000
That is the formula for it.
But I am trying to express it

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:52.000
in terms of the Laplace
transform of f itself.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:55.000
Now, it is trying to be the
Laplace transform of f.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:23:00.000
The problem is that here,
a (t minus a) occurs,

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:04.000
which I don't like.
I would like that to be just a

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:09.000
t.
Now, in order not to confuse

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:11.000
you, and this is what confused
everybody, I will set t1 equal

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:15.000
to t minus a.
I will change the variable.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:19.000
This is called changing the
variable in a definite integral.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:23.000
How do you change the variable
in a definite integral?

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:27.000
You do it.
Well, let's leave the limits

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:30.000
for the moment.
e to the minus s

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:33.000
times --
Now, t, remember you can change

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:37.000
the variable forwards,
direct substitution,

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:39.000
but now I have to use the
inverse substitution.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:43.000
It's trivial,
but t is equal to t1 plus a.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:46.000
To change this I must

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:48.000
substitute backwards and make
that t1 plus a.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:51.000
How about the rest of it?
Well, this becomes u of t1.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:55.000
This is f of t1.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:57.000
I have to change the dt,
too, but that's no problem.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:01.000
dt1 equals dt
because a is a constant.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:06.000
That is dt1.
And the last step is to put in

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:09.000
the limits.
Now, when t is equal to zero,

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:12.000
t1 has the value
negative a.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:16.000
So this has to be negative a
when t is infinity.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:19.000
Infinity minus a is still
infinity, so that is still

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:23.000
infinity.
In other words,

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:25.000
this changes to that.
These two things,

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:28.000
whatever they are,
they have the same value.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:31.000
All I have done is changed the
variable.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:36.000
Make it change a variable.
But now, of course,

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:38.000
I want to make this look
better.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:40.000
How am I going to do that?
Well, first multiply out the

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:43.000
exponential and then you get a
factor e to the minus s(t1).

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:46.000
That is good.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:48.000
That goes with this guy.
Now I get a factor e to the

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:50.000
minus s times a from
the exponential law.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:53.000
But that does not have anything
to do with the integral.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:57.000
It is a constant as far as the
integral is concerned because it

00:24:54.000 --> 00:25:00.000
doesn't involve t1.
And, therefore,

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:02.000
I can pull it outside of the
integral sign.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:06.000
And write that e to the minus s
times a.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:11.000
Let's write it the other way.
Times the integral of what?

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:16.000
Well, e to the negative st1.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:20.000
Now, u of t1,
f of t1 times dt1.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:24.000
Still integrated from minus a

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:28.000
to infinity.
And now the final step.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:35.000
This u of t1 is zero
for negative values of t.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:40.000
And, therefore,
it is equal to one for positive

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:44.000
values of t.
It is equal to zero for

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:48.000
negative values of t,
which means I can forget about

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:53.000
the part of the integral that
goes from negative a to zero.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:58.000
I better rewrite this.

00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:02.000
Okay, leave that.
In other words,

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:06.000
this is equal to e to the minus
as times the

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:10.000
integral from zero to infinity
of e to the minus s --

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:14.000
Let me do the shifty part now.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:23.000
And this is since u of t1 is
equal to zero for

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:29.000
t1 less than zero.
That is why I can replace this

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:35.000
with zero.
Because from negative a to

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:39.000
zero, nothing is happening.
The integrand is zero.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:43.000
And why can I get rid of it
after that?

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:46.000
Well, because it is one after
that.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:49.000
And what is this thing?
This is the Laplace transform.

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:53.000
No, it is not the Laplace
transform they said.

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:57.000
Because you had t1 there,
not t.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:59.000
It is the Laplace transform
because this is a dummy

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:04.000
variable.
The t1 is integrated out.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:07.000
It is a dummy variable.
It doesn't matter what you call

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:11.000
it.
It is still the Laplace

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:13.000
transform if I make that wiggly
t or t star or tau or u.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:18.000
I can call it anything I want
and it is still the Laplace

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:22.000
transform of f of t.

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:30.000
What is the answer?
That is e to the negative as

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:33.000
times the Laplace transform of
the function f.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:39.000
That is what I promised you in
that formula.

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:41.000
Now, how about the other
formula?

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:43.000
Well, let's look at that
quickly.

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:45.000
That is, as I say,
just sleight of hand.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:48.000
But since that is the formula
you will be using at least half

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:52.000
the time you better learn it.
This little sleight of hand is

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:56.000
also reproduced in one page of
notes that I give you,

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:59.000
but maybe you will find it easy
to understand if I talk it out

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:03.000
loud.
The problem now is for the

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:06.000
second formula.
I am going to have to recopy

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:09.000
out the first one in order to
make the argument in a form in

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:13.000
which you will understand it,
I hope.

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:15.000
This goes to e to the minus as
F s,

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:19.000
except I am now going to write
that not in F of s;

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:22.000
since I will not be able to
write the second formula using F

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:26.000
of s, I am not going to write
the first formula that way

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:30.000
either.
I will write it as the Laplace

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:32.000
transform with f of t.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:36.000
Now, formally if somebody says,
okay, how do I calculate the

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:40.000
Laplace transform of this thing?
I say put down this.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:45.000
Well, that has no t in it.
It doesn't have the f in it

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:49.000
either.
Then write this.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:51.000
What formula did I do?
I looked at that and changed t

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:56.000
minus a to t. Now,
how did I change t minus a?

00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:01.000
The way to say it is

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:04.000
I changed t.
Because the t is always there.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:08.000
t to t plus a.
You get this by replace t by t

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:14.000
plus a to get the right-hand
side.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:22.000
I replace this t by t plus a,
and that turns this

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:26.000
into f of t.
And that is the f of t

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:28.000
that went in there.
That is the universal rule for

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:32.000
doing it.
Now I am going to use that same

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:34.000
rule for transforming u of t
minus a times f of t.

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:38.000
See, the problem is now I have

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:42.000
a function like t squared
or sine t,

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:45.000
which is not written in terms
of t minus a.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:48.000
And I don't know what to do
with it.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:50.000
The answer is,
by brute force,

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:52.000
write it in terms of t minus a.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:55.000
What is brute force?
Brute force is the following.

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:58.000
I am going to put a t minus a
there if it kills me.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:02.000
t minus a plus a.
No harm in that,

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:07.000
is there?
Now there is a t minus a there,

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:10.000
just the way there was up
there.

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:12.000
And now what is the rule?
I am just going to follow my

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:17.000
nose.
What's sauce for the goose is

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:19.000
sauce for the gander.
Minus as, Laplace transform of

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:23.000
f of, now what am I going to
write here?

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:26.000
Wherever I see a t,
I am going to change it from t

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:30.000
plus a.
Here I see a t.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:35.000
I will change that
to t plus a.

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:39.000
What do I have?
t plus a minus a plus a,

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:43.000
well,
if you can keep count,

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:47.000
what does that make?
It makes t plus a in

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:52.000
the end.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:08.000
The peace that passeth
understanding.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:10.000
Let's do some examples and
suddenly you will breathe a sigh

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:14.000
of relief that this all is
doable anyway.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:17.000
Let's calculate something.
I hope I am not covering up any

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:22.000
crucial, yes I am.
I am covering up the u of t's,

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:25.000
but you know that by now.
Let's see.

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:28.000
What should we calculate first?
What I just covered up.

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:33.000
Let's calculate the Laplace
transform of (u)ab of t.

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:37.000
What is that going to be?

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:40.000
Well, first of all,
write out what it is in terms

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:44.000
of the unit step function.

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:51.000
Remember that formula?
There.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:53.000
Now you see it.
Now you don't.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:56.000
Its Laplace transform is going
to be what?

00:31:54.000 --> 00:32:00.000
Well, the Laplace transform of
t minus a,

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:05.000
that is a special case here
where this function is one.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:11.000
Well, that one.
Either one.

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:13.000
It makes no difference.
It is simply going to be the

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:17.000
Laplace transform of what f of t
would have been,

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:21.000
which is --

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:32.000
See, the Laplace transform of u
of t is what?

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:36.000
That's one over s,
right?

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:37.000
Because this is the function
one, and we don't care the fact

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:42.000
that it is zero or negative
values of t.

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:45.000
That is my f of s.
And so I multiply it by e to

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:49.000
the minus as times one over s.

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:52.000
I am using this formula,
e to the minus as times the

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:56.000
Laplace transform of the unit
step function,

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:59.000
which is one over s.
How about the translation?

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:05.000
That was taken care of by the
exponential factor.

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:09.000
And it's minus because this is
minus.

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:12.000
The same thing with the b.
This is the Laplace transform

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:16.000
of the unit box function.
It looks a little hairy.

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:20.000
You will learn to work with it,
don't worry about it.

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:25.000
How about the Laplace transform
of --

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:29.000
Okay.
Let's use the other formula.

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:31.000
What would be the Laplace
transform of u of t minus one

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:35.000
times t squared, for example?

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:39.000
See, if I gave this to you and
you only had the first formula,

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:44.000
you would say,
hey, but there is no t minus

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:47.000
one in there.
There is only t squared.

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:50.000
What am I supposed to do?

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:52.000
Well, some of you might dig way
back into high school and say

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:57.000
every polynomial can be written
in powers of t minus one,

00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:02.000
that is what I will do.
That would give the right

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:08.000
answer.
But in case you had forgotten

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:11.000
how to do that,
you don't have to know because

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:14.000
you could use the other formula
instead, which,

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:18.000
by the way, is the way you do
it.

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:21.000
What are we going to do?
It goes into e to the minus s.

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:25.000
The a is one in this case,

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:28.000
plus one.
e to the minus s times the

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:31.000
Laplace transform of what
function?

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:36.000
Change t to t plus one.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:39.000
The Laplace transform of t plus
one squared.

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:44.000
What is that?
That is e to the minus s times

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:47.000
the Laplace transform of t
squared plus 2t plus one.

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:52.000
What's that?

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:55.000
Well, by the formulas which I
am not bothering to write on the

00:34:54.000 --> 00:35:00.000
board anymore because you know
them, it is e to the minus s

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:05.000
times --
Laplace transform of t squared

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:10.000
is two factorial over s cubed.

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:13.000
Remember you always have to

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:15.000
raise the exponent by one.
This is two factorial,

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:18.000
but that is the same as two.
Plus two.

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:21.000
This two comes from there.
The Laplace transform of t is

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:25.000
one over s squared.

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:27.000
And, finally,
the Laplace transform of one is

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:30.000
one over s.
You mean all that mess from

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:36.000
this simple-looking function?
This function is not so simple.

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:40.000
What is its graph?
What is it we are calculating

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:44.000
the Laplace transform of?
Well, it is the function t

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:48.000
squared.
But multiplying it by that

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:51.000
factor u of t minus one
means that the only part of

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:56.000
it I am using is this part,
because u of t minus one is one

00:35:55.000 --> 00:36:01.000
when t is
bigger than one.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:06.000
But when t is less than one it
is zero.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:08.000
That function doesn't look all
that simple to me.

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:11.000
And that is why its Laplace
transform has three terms in it

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:15.000
with this exponential factor.
Well, it is a discontinuous

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:19.000
function.
And it gets discontinuous at a

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:22.000
very peculiar spot.
You have to expect that.

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:25.000
Where in this does it tell you
it becomes discontinuous at one?

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:29.000
It is because this is e to the
minus one times s.

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:35.000
This tells you where the
discontinuity occurs.

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:38.000
The rest of it is just stuff
you have to take because it is

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:43.000
the function t squared.
It's what it is.

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:47.000
All right.
I think most of you are going

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:50.000
to encounter the worst troubles
when you try to calculate

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:55.000
inverse Laplace transforms,
so let me try to explain how

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:59.000
that is done.
I will give you a simple

00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:02.000
example first.
And then I will try to give you

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:07.000
a slightly more complicated one.
But even the simple one won't

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:12.000
make your head ache.
We are going to calculate the

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:17.000
inverse Laplace transform of
this guy, one plus e to the

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:22.000
negative pi s --

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:30.000
-- divided by s squared plus
one.

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:41.000
All right.
Now, the first thing you must

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:43.000
do is as soon as you see
exponential factors in there

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:46.000
like that you know that these
functions, the answer is going

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:50.000
to be a discontinuous function.
And you have got to separate

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:54.000
out the different pieces of it
that go with the different

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:58.000
exponentials.
Because the way the formula

00:37:54.000 --> 00:38:00.000
works, it has to be used
differently for each value of a.

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:05.000
Now, in this case,
there is only one value of a

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:08.000
that occurs.
Negative pi.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:09.000
But it does mean that we are
going to have to begin by

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:13.000
separating out the thing into
one over s squared plus one

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:17.000
and this other
factor e to the negative pi s

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:21.000
divided by s squared plus one.

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:25.000
Now all I have to do is take
the inverse Laplace transform of

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:29.000
each piece.
The inverse Laplace transform

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:32.000
of one over s squared plus one
is --

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:38.000
Well, up to now we have been
saying its sine t,

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:42.000
right?
If you say it is sine t you are

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:44.000
going to get into trouble.
How come?

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:47.000
We didn't get into trouble
before.

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:49.000
Yes, but that was because there
were no exponentials in the

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:53.000
expression.
When there are exponentials you

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:56.000
have to be more careful.
Make the inverse transform

00:38:54.000 --> 00:39:00.000
unique.
Make it not sine t,

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:02.000
but u of t sine t.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:06.000
You will see why in just a
moment.

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:08.000
If this weren't there then sine
t would be perfectly okay.

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:13.000
With that factor there,
you have got to put in the u of

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:17.000
t, otherwise you won't
be able to get the formula to

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:22.000
work right.
In other words,

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:24.000
I must use this particular one
that I picked out to make it

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:29.000
unique at the beginning of the
period.

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:32.000
Otherwise, it just won't work.
Now, I know that is fine.

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:37.000
But now what is the inverse
Laplace transform of e to the

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:41.000
minus pi?
In other words,

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:44.000
it is the same function,
except I am now multiplying it

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:47.000
by e to the negative pi s.

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:50.000
Well, now I will use that
formula.

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:52.000
My f of s is one over s squared
plus one,

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:56.000
and that corresponds it to
sine t.

00:39:54.000 --> 00:40:00.000
If I multiply it by e to the
minus pi s,

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:03.000
just copy it down.
It now corresponds,

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:08.000
the inverse Laplace transform,
to what the left side says it

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:14.000
does.
u of t minus pi

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:18.000
times, in other words,
this corresponds to that.

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:23.000
Then if I multiply it by e to
the minus pi s,

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:29.000
it corresponds to change the t
to t minus pi.

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:44.000
What is the answer?
The answer is you sum these two

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:49.000
pieces.
The first piece is u of time

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:53.000
sine t.
The second piece is u of t

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:59.000
minus pi sine t of minus pi.

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:06.000
Now, if you leave the answer in
that form it is technically

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:11.000
correct, but you are going to
lose a lot of credit.

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:15.000
You have to transform it to
make it look good.

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:19.000
You have to make it
intelligible.

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:22.000
You are not allowed to leave it
in that form.

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:26.000
What could we do to it?
Well, you see,

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:30.000
this part of it is interesting
whenever t is positive.

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:36.000
This part of it is only
interesting when t is greater

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:40.000
than or equal to pi because
this is zero.

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:43.000
Before that this is zero.
What you have to do is make

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:47.000
cases.
Let's call the answer f of t.

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:50.000
The function has to be

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:53.000
presented in what is called the
cases format.

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:56.000
That is what it is called when
you type in tech,

00:41:54.000 --> 00:42:00.000
which I think a certain number
of you can do anyway.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:06.000
You have to make cases.
The first case is what happened

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:10.000
between zero and pi?
Well, between zero and pi,

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:14.000
only this term is operational.
The other one is zero because

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:18.000
of that factor.
Therefore, between zero and pi

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:22.000
the function looks like,
now, I don't have to put in the

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:27.000
u of t because that is
equal to one.

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:30.000
It is equal to sine t
between zero and pi.

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:36.000
What is it equal to bigger than
pi?

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:38.000
Well, the first factor,
the first term still obtains,

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:42.000
so I have to include that.
But now I have to add the

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:46.000
second one.
Well, what is the second term?

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:49.000
I don't include the t minus
pi, u of t minus pi

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:54.000
anymore because
that is now one.

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:57.000
That has the value one.
It is sine of t minus pi.

00:42:55.000 --> 00:43:01.000
But what is sine of t minus pi?

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:06.000
You take the sine curve and you
translate it to the right by pi.

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:13.000
So what happens to it?
It turns into this curve.

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:19.000
In other words,
it turns into the curve,

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:24.000
what curve is that?
Minus sine t.

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:36.000
The other factor,
this factor is one and this

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:39.000
becomes negative sine t.

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:48.000
And so the final answer is f of
t is equal to sine t

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:56.000
between zero and pi and
zero for t greater than or equal

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:04.000
to pi.
That is the right form of the

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:09.000
answer.

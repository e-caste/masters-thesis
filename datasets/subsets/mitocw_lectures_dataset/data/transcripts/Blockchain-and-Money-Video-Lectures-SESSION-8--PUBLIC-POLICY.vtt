00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:27.720
GARY GENSLER:
Welcome, hello again.

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.070
Yeah, Yeah.

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:31.490
I put my jacket back on.

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.690
I figured I was doing public
policy today, had to look

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:37.340
a little official.

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.130
So let's talk a little
bit about public policy

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.280
and some of the challenges
that we're going to do.

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.890
And the overview of today--

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.380
we're going to chat a little bit
about the readings, of course.

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:53.360
And then I want to set it up
a bit on crypto finance, just

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.800
a simple term of this $200
or $250 billion dollar space,

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.140
because a lot of the public
policy is about crypto finance,

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.000
though there are some public
policy about underlying

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.060
blockchain technology.

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.090
It's both, but most of it's
about the financial markets

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.900
around cryptocurrencies
and crypto tokens.

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.310
Give an overall public
policy framework,

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.130
talk about the three
guardrails, the big rails

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:28.000
of illicit activity, financial
stability, and the public.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.800
And then I'm going
to share a little bit

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.100
of some slides and some thoughts
on public policy development.

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.590
As many of you know,
I've spent the last 20

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.860
years kicking around
politics and public policy.

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:44.260
And as two or three of you know,
in this spring, Simon Johnson

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.870
and I stood up a course
called Public Policy

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:47.950
and the Private Sector.

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.620
So it's maybe my little
advertisement for next spring,

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:55.640
because we're going to
stand it up again as well.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:02.820
So the study questions which was
basically around public policy,

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.550
as you remember these questions.

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:11.050
And I'm sorry, because Talita
didn't give me my friendly list

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.540
as to who hasn't spoken up yet.

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:15.560
So that's Talita.

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.450
So you're saved, you're
saved, because now I can't

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.340
remember anybody that's not--

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.090
AUDIENCE: I can send
it to a printer.

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.016
GARY GENSLER: What's that?

00:02:22.016 --> 00:02:22.910
AUDIENCE: I can send
it to a printer.

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.035
GARY GENSLER: Yeah, you
can send it to a printer.

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.380
It's hard to remember with
85 registered students

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.550
as to who hasn't spoken
and who has spoken.

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.820
But you're all
going, here now, he's

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:40.920
going to do cold calling now.

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.550
But the main study questions
that we're going through

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.790
are basically around the
public policy framework

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.090
and how it relates to
blockchain technology.

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.585
But Catalina, what did you
take from the readings?

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.830
AUDIENCE: What I took
from the readings

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:03.840
is that for blockchain
to further develop,

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.510
it has to be embedded
in the regulatory system

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.635
and in the policy system.

00:03:10.635 --> 00:03:14.430
In that way, for example,
investors will be better off.

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.010
They will have
protections, they will

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.420
feel better because they will
have some degree of certainty

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.595
that someone is
taking care of them.

00:03:24.595 --> 00:03:26.220
GARY GENSLER: And so
Catalina is saying

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.150
she took from the readings
that for further adoption,

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.680
investor protection, and the
confidence in the markets

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.970
are important.

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:37.673
Lauren, did I see that you're--

00:03:37.673 --> 00:03:38.590
AUDIENCE: Sorry, yeah.

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:40.297
So I was going to say--

00:03:40.297 --> 00:03:42.130
I mean, one of the
readings was a little bit

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:43.150
the opposite of this.

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.680
But to build on that, the
mention of regulations

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.440
and validating
blockchain a little bit

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.295
will help the players that
are already in the markets

00:03:53.295 --> 00:03:55.420
explore in that space, just
because they tend to be

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:57.100
a little more risk averse.

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.650
So they haven't really
dabbled in startups and things

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:00.695
that have the advantage.

00:04:00.695 --> 00:04:02.570
GARY GENSLER: So in
essence, that some people

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:06.310
were risk averse, the incumbents
are a bit risk averse.

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:11.860
And why would incumbent,
big-- oh, this is my fun list.

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:12.970
It's not your fun list.

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:17.230
But really, there's still
35 of you that have not even

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:20.529
spoken up in this class.

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:21.519
Don't be so shy.

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:27.350
Watch this.

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:29.220
Watch this.

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:30.220
Ariel Brito.

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.370
Not even here.

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.660
Even better, even better.

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:40.165
Talita, we have a sign up
sheet, too, that's going around?

00:04:40.165 --> 00:04:40.790
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:43.110
GARY GENSLER: All
right, that's fun.

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:50.440
Watch, I'll just say David, and
then see which David speaks up.

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:00.370
This is going to be
a really interesting.

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:02.620
So you mean there's
no David Martin here.

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:04.930
Right here.

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:06.140
Oh.

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:10.930
AUDIENCE: So to
your first question,

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:14.050
this relates to the current
public policy frameworks

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:17.660
in my mind in two ways.

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:23.020
One, this technology
sits, in some ways,

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:25.810
in gaps in the current
regulatory framework.

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:29.960
It's not clear, for
example, that the CFTC--

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:32.050
because this could
be a commodity--

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:36.970
has as broad regulatory
authority as the SEC

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:40.570
does, for example, with respect
to the securities markets.

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:42.760
It's in a gap.

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:48.510
But the second thing is, even
if those gaps were closed,

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:50.450
for certain kinds of
blockchain technology,

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:54.100
the anonymity and secrecy of
it just prevents regulation

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:55.630
almost entirely.

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:56.630
So there's two things.

00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:00.130
There's a gap question, and then
there's the impact of secrecy

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:02.310
and whether regulation
can find it.

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:03.310
GARY GENSLER: All right.

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:07.050
So there's a gap because
of the technology.

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:12.530
But are there other gaps also--

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:14.643
and your first name is?

00:06:14.643 --> 00:06:15.310
AUDIENCE: James.

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:16.670
GARY GENSLER: Jim.

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:18.421
AUDIENCE: James, yeah.

00:06:18.421 --> 00:06:24.000
So I think that another problem
with regulating blockchain

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.320
technology in general is because
the lack of intermediaries.

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:30.880
The way that traditional
regulation works

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:36.190
is that they try to have more
close access to intermediaries,

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:38.410
so that they can control
the intermediaries.

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:40.410
But now, there's
no intermediary.

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:43.007
So it's very hard
for you to control.

00:06:43.007 --> 00:06:44.590
GARY GENSLER: So
what James is raising

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:48.610
is there might be a whole change
in this ecosystem, a little bit

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:52.150
of the business model that
there's fewer intermediaries.

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:54.130
And a lot of
regulation, whether that

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:57.850
be tax, or investor
protection, or even

00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:01.120
around illicit activity,
centers around intermediaries.

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:04.390
Why do you think it is
that so much of the law

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:07.260
centers around intermediaries?

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:08.980
It wasn't specific
in the readings.

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:12.130
But just why do you
think that that--

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:12.700
Isabella?

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:14.770
AUDIENCE: Well, I would
assume that if intermediaries

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:16.687
are going to be eliminated
by this technology,

00:07:16.687 --> 00:07:18.580
then a lot of those
players would not really

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:20.900
want this technology
to be pushed forward.

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:21.407
So that's--

00:07:21.407 --> 00:07:22.990
GARY GENSLER: All
right, so Isabella's

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:26.230
raising a point that
maybe intermediaries would

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:29.200
be threatened about
this technology.

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:34.170
But I'm also asking, why do you
think the law historically--

00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:35.500
Adian?

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:41.020
Why the law has attached
requirements on intermediaries.

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:42.520
AUDIENCE: I think
it's just easier

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:44.960
to manage a group of
intermediaries that

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:46.940
are regulated by law,
so you can actually

00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:48.440
look at the
transactions that happen

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:51.360
at the intermediary level.

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:53.100
GARY GENSLER: So
Adian's saying--

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:54.670
and in the red
jersey in the back,

00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:56.020
I can't remember your name.

00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:57.910
Dan.

00:07:57.910 --> 00:08:01.900
AUDIENCE: So I just think that
if any of these intermediaries

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:04.360
experience something
that caused them to fail,

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:06.130
then you're bringing
down a lot more

00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:08.200
than just that institution.

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:09.680
GARY GENSLER: So two ideas.

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:12.220
One is this
attachment point that

00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:16.030
has some leverage
to it in the system.

00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:19.000
You can exert some
public policy influence.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.130
And one is that there
might be a point of failure

00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:23.800
and you need to protect
the system from failure.

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:25.010
Other reasons back here?

00:08:26.908 --> 00:08:28.450
AUDIENCE: The
government just doesn't

00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:31.630
have the manpower or the
resources to look at everyone.

00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:33.400
And these
intermediaries actually

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:36.830
make money by
collecting this data.

00:08:36.830 --> 00:08:39.700
And so the government
can just use that.

00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:42.070
GARY GENSLER: So Jake's
raising a variation

00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:43.570
of the force multiplying.

00:08:43.570 --> 00:08:46.870
It's not only a node to apply,
but they have the resources.

00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:49.870
So you're tapping into
JP Morgan's back office,

00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:50.620
so to speak.

00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:53.510
And back here, I'll take.

00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:54.828
Sorry, your first name?

00:08:54.828 --> 00:08:55.704
AUDIENCE: Adam.

00:08:55.704 --> 00:08:56.142
GARY GENSLER: Adam.

00:08:56.142 --> 00:08:57.892
AUDIENCE: So the
intermediaries are also--

00:08:57.892 --> 00:09:02.740
they're a mechanism for trust to
allow trading between parties.

00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:06.130
So the regulation then would
be placed in like a consumer

00:09:06.130 --> 00:09:11.290
protection role to ensure
that those intermediaries are

00:09:11.290 --> 00:09:12.790
someone to trust.

00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:14.860
GARY GENSLER: So it's for
a collection of reasons

00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:18.670
that public policy
officials around the globe

00:09:18.670 --> 00:09:22.180
often attach requirements
to intermediaries,

00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:25.090
because it's a node to get
it done, it's a resource,

00:09:25.090 --> 00:09:28.000
they have deep
pockets sometimes.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.590
Sometimes, it's because
they might fail.

00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:32.170
And one thing that
wasn't mentioned

00:09:32.170 --> 00:09:34.990
is sometimes
actually institutions

00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:38.740
want to be regulated over time,
because it creates barriers

00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:40.160
to entry.

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:43.300
It's usually not
in an early stage.

00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:47.660
But later on, it's actually
the incumbents that often--

00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:49.570
it creates some
barriers to entry

00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:51.430
and they collect
some economic rents.

00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:52.290
Hugo?

00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:56.880
AUDIENCE: You can see that
starting now with the OG's

00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:00.780
in the crypto space, like
Coinbase or like the Bittrex,

00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:03.550
like the American
institutions that started

00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:05.380
their exchange early on.

00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:07.120
And now, they're
working with regulators

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:10.550
to see how they can
capture the market

00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:12.120
to be the easy place to go.

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:14.120
GARY GENSLER: So what
were the letters you said?

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:14.845
OD?

00:10:14.845 --> 00:10:15.710
AUDIENCE: OG.

00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:16.580
GARY GENSLER: OG.

00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:17.665
AUDIENCE: I don't know.

00:10:20.350 --> 00:10:23.060
GARY GENSLER: Does OG
stand for something?

00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:24.837
AUDIENCE: Original gangster.

00:10:24.837 --> 00:10:26.170
GARY GENSLER: Original gangster.

00:10:26.170 --> 00:10:28.060
Thank you, thank you.

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:31.540
My daughters will be
glad I know this now.

00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:32.440
That's very good.

00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:36.400
So it's moving from
the disruptor phase

00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:38.260
to the near-incumbent phase.

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:43.210
And where is a firm Hugo's
raised like Coinbase or others?

00:10:43.210 --> 00:10:46.120
Are they now the
incumbent in this only six

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:50.870
or 10-year-old
field, in essence?

00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:53.530
We're going to talk a
lot about tax and bank

00:10:53.530 --> 00:10:55.210
secrecy and the Howey Test.

00:10:55.210 --> 00:10:58.090
And I'm going to save you from
the cold calls on the Howey

00:10:58.090 --> 00:11:01.480
Test yet, but be prepared
when we get to that slide.

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:03.210
We'll talk a little bit more.

00:11:03.210 --> 00:11:06.910
And then, of course, my
favorite, the Duck Test.

00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:11.700
So anybody know who
the American poet--

00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:13.850
AUDIENCE: W. Riley?

00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:15.100
GARY GENSLER: Oh, really good.

00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:15.820
Where's he from?

00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:19.460
Didn't say?

00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:21.420
Anybody where Riley's from?

00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:22.400
No, it's not in--

00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:24.720
I don't think it's in the--
is it in the testimony?

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:25.630
AUDIENCE: Indiana.

00:11:25.630 --> 00:11:28.020
GARY GENSLER: Indiana, good.

00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:28.940
You're right.

00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:32.090
Seems like a good
Midwestern saying, you know?

00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:35.630
AUDIENCE: If it walks like
a duck, talks like a duck,

00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:38.420
and quacks like a
duck, it's a damn duck.

00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:41.830
GARY GENSLER: There
you go, there you go.

00:11:41.830 --> 00:11:43.330
No, no--

00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:48.250
AUDIENCE: What if it's a
robotic duck or a computer

00:11:48.250 --> 00:11:52.430
screen walking and
talking like a duck?

00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:54.830
GARY GENSLER: So Christopher's
raising the question,

00:11:54.830 --> 00:11:58.400
if it's a robotic duck,
a robotic duck that's

00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:00.770
walking like a duck,
quacking like a duck,

00:12:00.770 --> 00:12:05.110
and waddling like a
duck, is it a darn duck?

00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:09.190
For purposes of public
policy, maybe it is, right?

00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:12.970
If it's a smart contract
that's waddling like a duck

00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:16.180
and quacking like a
duck, maybe it still

00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:19.720
has the influence over
society like a duck.

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:21.130
And this Duck Test--

00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:24.640
I didn't originated it,
Riley did 100 plus years ago.

00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:27.850
But it is something that
regulators and public policy

00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:29.290
people actually talk about.

00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:32.230
It's one of those things,
if you're in Washington.

00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:37.000
Well, other people might call it
different things, but the Duck

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:37.960
Test.

00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:44.050
It's use common sense, and
then answer the question.

00:12:44.050 --> 00:12:46.990
Oh my gosh, I assigned one of
my own writings as a reading.

00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:48.550
So we'll skip over that.

00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:51.305
So crypto, the world
of crypto finance,

00:12:51.305 --> 00:12:52.930
you've seen this
slide before, but it's

00:12:52.930 --> 00:12:58.630
been quite volatile, about $220
billion in the last few days.

00:12:58.630 --> 00:13:02.650
And a little over
50%, 54% is Bitcoin

00:13:02.650 --> 00:13:06.340
and the other big
currencies right now

00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:11.050
on market value, Ethereum,
Ripple, and the like.

00:13:11.050 --> 00:13:13.900
We'll talk a lot about
initial coin offerings.

00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:16.000
And are they securities
or are they not?

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.270
But I would note, in
terms of market value,

00:13:19.270 --> 00:13:22.910
probably three
quarters of this space

00:13:22.910 --> 00:13:25.760
has already been determined
by the Securities and Exchange

00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:27.530
Commission not to be a security.

00:13:27.530 --> 00:13:33.990
Bitcoin's 54%, Ether's about 15
points or something like that.

00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:36.740
So you're all of a sudden
up to about 70 points,

00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:39.080
and then there's a bunch of
other things that add up.

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:42.560
So about three quarters
of the market value

00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:49.960
right now is what one might
call a cash, or a commodity,

00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:52.750
but not a security
in this world.

00:13:52.750 --> 00:13:56.400
And that's just relevant for
some of the debates that go on.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.980
We talked about
this a little bit.

00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:04.130
Like the lioness the
corner, incumbents

00:14:04.130 --> 00:14:06.110
are starting to
eye crypto finance.

00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:10.220
So it's raising some
of the challenges.

00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:13.690
Why are they interested in this?

00:14:13.690 --> 00:14:20.830
Why are incumbents interested
in getting into this place?

00:14:20.830 --> 00:14:21.330
EG Wang?

00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:26.530
Oh, come on.

00:14:26.530 --> 00:14:27.910
I can't be this bad off.

00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:31.140
Am I?

00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:33.680
Really, all these people
haven't even said a word, huh.

00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:37.800
Is EG here.

00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:41.990
No, so look at this.

00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:42.920
This is even easier.

00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:47.770
Now, I'll find out if somebody's
signing in for other people.

00:14:47.770 --> 00:14:49.955
How about Nikita?

00:14:49.955 --> 00:14:51.555
AUDIENCE: Yes?

00:14:51.555 --> 00:14:53.930
GARY GENSLER: Why do you think
incumbents want to get in?

00:14:57.830 --> 00:15:01.580
AUDIENCE: It's a
risky transaction.

00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:05.240
From the viewpoint
[INAUDIBLE] it's

00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:09.730
difficult to do
this crypto finance.

00:15:13.085 --> 00:15:14.952
GARY GENSLER: You said
it's difficult to do?

00:15:14.952 --> 00:15:16.010
AUDIENCE: For incumbents.

00:15:16.010 --> 00:15:16.790
GARY GENSLER: Yeah,
but why did they

00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:18.360
want to get into this space?

00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:20.310
Why do they want to
be in crypto finance?

00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:25.310
AUDIENCE: Part of it is
that it's highly volatile.

00:15:25.310 --> 00:15:28.065
And how do you make money
largely off of volatility?

00:15:28.065 --> 00:15:29.690
And then there's also
a lot of people--

00:15:29.690 --> 00:15:32.210
I think it's what, like 20
million Coinbase accounts.

00:15:32.210 --> 00:15:33.390
GARY GENSLER: Right, right.

00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:35.098
So when I was at
Goldman Sachs for years,

00:15:35.098 --> 00:15:36.200
we used to have a saying.

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:38.600
Volatility is our friend.

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:42.620
It's often not the friend of
many people in the markets.

00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:44.270
But if you're in
the world of finance

00:15:44.270 --> 00:15:47.450
or you're in the world of inter
mediating risk and holding

00:15:47.450 --> 00:15:47.960
risks--

00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:51.060
so volatility is a form of risk.

00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:53.030
So volatility was
always our friend.

00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:54.980
It was also our
friend, because often

00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:57.380
if it was really
volatile, sometimes some

00:15:57.380 --> 00:16:01.070
of our competitors would not
manage that risk as well.

00:16:01.070 --> 00:16:02.780
And they would
lose market share,

00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:04.540
and we would gain market share.

00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:07.940
In fact, maybe they went
out of business, too.

00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:11.080
But people like the volatility.

00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:14.480
Startups can beg for
forgiveness afterwards.

00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:17.180
Incumbents feel more
often, not always,

00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:19.130
that they need to
ask for permission.

00:16:19.130 --> 00:16:22.430
And so there's a little bit of
an asymmetric reputational risk

00:16:22.430 --> 00:16:25.590
that goes on business-wise.

00:16:25.590 --> 00:16:27.760
Now, once you're
at a big incumbent,

00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:31.390
if you work for one
of the big places,

00:16:31.390 --> 00:16:35.010
you'll feel that little bit
more constraint, a little bit

00:16:35.010 --> 00:16:36.630
more compliance officers.

00:16:36.630 --> 00:16:39.360
You're more lawyered, you
have more accountants.

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:41.560
But you should still
have the same values.

00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:43.560
I say this sincerely.

00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:45.690
Don't break the law.

00:16:45.690 --> 00:16:47.370
No, no, sincerely.

00:16:47.370 --> 00:16:49.360
But when you're at a
startup, you tend--

00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:51.810
there's always some ambiguity,
and you take a little bit

00:16:51.810 --> 00:16:54.940
more reputational risk.

00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:57.690
You tend to.

00:16:57.690 --> 00:16:59.790
So there's a bunch
of incumbents that

00:16:59.790 --> 00:17:03.360
are trying to get in the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, Eurex,

00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:05.760
Intercontinental Exchange,
which owns the New York Stock

00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:06.260
Exchange.

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:09.930
We'll do a whole class
on what they're doing

00:17:09.930 --> 00:17:12.900
there later in the semester.

00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:15.210
Fidelity, that's spending
significant amount

00:17:15.210 --> 00:17:19.310
of money looking
at it and others.

00:17:19.310 --> 00:17:21.450
So the framework that
we've talked about,

00:17:21.450 --> 00:17:24.329
about guarding against
illicit activity, stability,

00:17:24.329 --> 00:17:26.220
and the investing public--

00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:28.230
I'm going to sort
through each of these,

00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:29.700
but it's tax compliance.

00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:34.810
No government wants to
shrink their tax base.

00:17:34.810 --> 00:17:38.410
Now, some governments
want to attract activity

00:17:38.410 --> 00:17:43.010
that shrinks the other
jurisdiction's tax base,

00:17:43.010 --> 00:17:47.150
but it's not about shrinking
your own tax base usually.

00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:50.090
I mean, you might
by law lower taxes,

00:17:50.090 --> 00:17:53.090
but you're not
really looking to--

00:17:53.090 --> 00:17:54.530
generally,
governments don't want

00:17:54.530 --> 00:17:57.890
to promote whatever the
definition of illicit activity.

00:17:57.890 --> 00:17:59.840
We don't need to define
that in this class.

00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:03.570
It's a normative thing that
happens culture by culture,

00:18:03.570 --> 00:18:05.750
jurisdiction by jurisdiction.

00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:10.010
But there tends to be
something that's prohibited--

00:18:10.010 --> 00:18:14.330
drug running, for instance,
child trafficking.

00:18:14.330 --> 00:18:16.640
I mean, there are certain
things that are broadly

00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:18.200
defined as illicit,
and then there's

00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:23.180
some that changes depending
upon the culture and the society

00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:25.730
and the times we're living in.

00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:28.940
Terrorism financing, clearly.

00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:32.440
And then sanctions, it's
a tool of foreign policy

00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:35.180
that countries like our own,
but Europe and elsewhere

00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:37.560
often use sanctions to try to--

00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:39.320
it's centuries old.

00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:43.670
It's called blockades in an
earlier century with the ships.

00:18:43.670 --> 00:18:46.010
But now, we do it
more electronically

00:18:46.010 --> 00:18:48.170
and commercially.

00:18:48.170 --> 00:18:52.520
Financial stability tends
to be about the stability

00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:56.780
of the overall economy
or the Fiat currency.

00:18:56.780 --> 00:18:59.630
Or I put a little
second picture there,

00:18:59.630 --> 00:19:02.780
the stability of the
commercial banking system.

00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:05.990
So financial stability can
mean a lot of different things,

00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:09.620
but it's usually about
the currency, the economy,

00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:14.690
or the central bank system
and commercial bank system.

00:19:14.690 --> 00:19:17.660
But to some countries,
not a majority,

00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:19.280
some countries'
financial stability

00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:21.590
is about capital controls.

00:19:21.590 --> 00:19:25.970
If a country is controlling
somewhere the valuation

00:19:25.970 --> 00:19:27.740
of their Fiat
currency-- remember,

00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:30.320
we talked a lot about money.

00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:33.230
But if some don't
want to flood and they

00:19:33.230 --> 00:19:36.410
want to control the value
of their Fiat currency,

00:19:36.410 --> 00:19:39.260
then they often have
capital controls.

00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:44.240
And for those countries, this
whole world of crypto finance

00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:45.680
touches on that.

00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:49.070
And then the investing
public, the consuming public,

00:19:49.070 --> 00:19:51.470
we'll talk about investor
protection and consumer

00:19:51.470 --> 00:19:54.660
protection are not
exactly the same.

00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:57.830
The two words market
integrity means basically

00:19:57.830 --> 00:20:01.820
we promote economic activity
if you can have confidence

00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:04.740
in central market structures.

00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:07.700
Whether that's the
pricing of apples

00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:11.380
or the pricing of
Apple stock, it's

00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:14.020
in essence that there's
not fraud and manipulation

00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:15.960
in that market.

00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:18.090
And the more
transparent the prices

00:20:18.090 --> 00:20:22.140
are both before you do a
transaction and after--

00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:23.745
what's called
pre-trade transparency

00:20:23.745 --> 00:20:28.140
and post-trade transparency--
the more transparent

00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:31.490
and the more you can root
out manipulation and fraud,

00:20:31.490 --> 00:20:32.680
there's more integrity.

00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:37.000
Usually very simply-- and this
is a lot of economic study goes

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:37.810
into it--

00:20:37.810 --> 00:20:40.990
you lower the risk
premium in that market.

00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:44.050
In essence, you can have more
confidence in that market.

00:20:44.050 --> 00:20:46.180
And secondly, you
have more competition

00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:48.780
in the price discovery function.

00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:49.420
Aline?

00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:51.253
AUDIENCE: It's really
a very silly question.

00:20:51.253 --> 00:20:54.310
But you said pre-transaction
transparency.

00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:56.830
So how does that relate
to the United States

00:20:56.830 --> 00:20:58.390
when you go to
the doctor and you

00:20:58.390 --> 00:21:00.140
have no idea how much
you're going to pay?

00:21:02.332 --> 00:21:04.540
It seems like there's no
pre-transaction transparency

00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:06.638
when you go to the doctor.

00:21:06.638 --> 00:21:08.680
GARY GENSLER: I tend to
agree with you that there

00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:10.900
are many markets,
not just health care,

00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:13.570
but there are many
markets where there's

00:21:13.570 --> 00:21:17.320
limited pre-transaction
transparency.

00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:20.650
I feel there's only limited
pre-transaction transparency

00:21:20.650 --> 00:21:24.500
when I take my car
in to get worked on.

00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:26.720
Now, of course, then they
give you some pricing

00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:31.190
and the car is already
up on the platform.

00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:34.520
And they're telling you
need your new brakes.

00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:36.680
So yes, that's true.

00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:40.250
Lots of different markets
operate in different ways.

00:21:40.250 --> 00:21:42.680
And health care is
probably less transparent,

00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:45.380
partly because it's
such a hybrid market

00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:48.200
where we have third party
payment providers, insurance

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:50.960
companies, and governments
providing and paying

00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:54.530
for a lot of our health care.

00:21:54.530 --> 00:21:59.600
So economic activity
has a range.

00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:02.960
In the financial
markets, market integrity

00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:08.732
is boosted by a lot of
pre-trade transparency.

00:22:08.732 --> 00:22:13.190
Does that help a little?

00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:15.860
So Mark Carney--
what did you all

00:22:15.860 --> 00:22:19.040
take from Mark Carney's paper?

00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:22.250
Anybody wants to volunteer, or
I can keep going down my list.

00:22:22.250 --> 00:22:24.590
Rahim?

00:22:24.590 --> 00:22:26.420
Did I get your name right?

00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:27.830
What's that?

00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:29.185
Riham.

00:22:29.185 --> 00:22:31.060
AUDIENCE: I'm talking
about the [INAUDIBLE]..

00:22:33.268 --> 00:22:35.060
GARY GENSLER: So one
thing that Mark Carney

00:22:35.060 --> 00:22:36.590
said is he didn't
really consider

00:22:36.590 --> 00:22:39.680
cryptocurrencies currencies,
but they were an asset.

00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:42.176
What else did Mark say?

00:22:42.176 --> 00:22:44.293
AUDIENCE: My name's
Matt Doherty.

00:22:44.293 --> 00:22:45.460
GARY GENSLER: Thalita, Matt.

00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:50.540
AUDIENCE: One of
the reasons he said

00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:54.140
it wasn't a currency was because
of the extreme volatility that

00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:57.900
meant it had no intrinsic
value, which I disagreed with.

00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:00.410
I didn't think that
volatility should equate

00:23:00.410 --> 00:23:01.630
to a lack of intrinsic value.

00:23:01.630 --> 00:23:02.630
GARY GENSLER: All right.

00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:06.380
So Matt's raising that Mark
Carney says, well, volatility

00:23:06.380 --> 00:23:08.270
can't be a currency.

00:23:08.270 --> 00:23:11.830
I tend to agree with Matt.

00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:14.665
And if Mark were here, I'd
say it to him directly.

00:23:14.665 --> 00:23:16.040
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
stocks that

00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:18.230
are extremely
volatile, but yet still

00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:20.605
haven't been
devalued [INAUDIBLE]..

00:23:20.605 --> 00:23:21.980
GARY GENSLER: I
would say there's

00:23:21.980 --> 00:23:27.260
even some Fiat currencies that
have been pretty volatile.

00:23:27.260 --> 00:23:31.280
AUDIENCE: So I think that it
does have intrinsic value,

00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:33.830
but maybe not necessarily
be a currency if it's not

00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:36.550
a dependable unit of account,
if it's always fluctuating.

00:23:36.550 --> 00:23:38.890
And that was my take anyway.

00:23:38.890 --> 00:23:42.720
So I agree, but it's just a
different line of reasoning

00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:43.555
why I don't think--

00:23:43.555 --> 00:23:45.090
GARY GENSLER: So you think
it's a different reason

00:23:45.090 --> 00:23:46.257
that it has intrinsic value.

00:23:46.257 --> 00:23:48.215
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I think
it has intrinsic value,

00:23:48.215 --> 00:23:50.760
I just think that it should
be called a digital asset, not

00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:52.530
because it doesn't
have intrinsic value,

00:23:52.530 --> 00:23:54.963
but because it's not a
dependable unit of account.

00:23:54.963 --> 00:23:56.380
GARY GENSLER: And
your first name?

00:23:56.380 --> 00:23:57.005
I'm sorry.

00:23:57.005 --> 00:23:57.380
AUDIENCE: Kyle.

00:23:57.380 --> 00:23:58.172
GARY GENSLER: Kyle.

00:23:58.172 --> 00:24:00.240
So Kyle's saying that
it's because it's not

00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:02.100
a dependable unit of account.

00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:05.520
And very few places have
used it as a unit of account

00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:07.900
at this point in time.

00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:11.820
Matt-- it's good, we're
going to have a debate here.

00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:13.985
AUDIENCE: But the fact
that places have used it

00:24:13.985 --> 00:24:18.290
as a unit of account should make
it so that it is a currency.

00:24:18.290 --> 00:24:20.820
It has been used as a
currency in the past.

00:24:20.820 --> 00:24:24.685
And whether five people use
it or a million people use it,

00:24:24.685 --> 00:24:26.060
shouldn't the fact
that it can be

00:24:26.060 --> 00:24:28.580
used qualify it to be a
currency, whether it's

00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:31.288
to a certain amount of people
shouldn't necessarily matter.

00:24:31.288 --> 00:24:33.080
GARY GENSLER: And so
who wants to arbitrate

00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:37.310
between Matt and Kyle?

00:24:37.310 --> 00:24:38.727
Leonardo.

00:24:38.727 --> 00:24:41.060
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I wanted to
give an example of countries

00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:43.950
where there is super
high inflation, where

00:24:43.950 --> 00:24:48.120
their domestic currencies
lose what it's really worth.

00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:49.820
So people actually
automatically start

00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:53.360
to use dollars, for example,
as their reference account.

00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:55.730
So it can be
functional in the sense

00:24:55.730 --> 00:24:58.640
that people can still
exchange, but you can't really

00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:01.107
measure until you peg
to something else.

00:25:01.107 --> 00:25:03.440
And actually, Bitcoin's pegged
to the value of something

00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:04.320
else today.

00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:08.490
And that's where I think
the value of accounts--

00:25:08.490 --> 00:25:12.053
I'll be on the left side camp.

00:25:12.053 --> 00:25:13.220
GARY GENSLER: So it depends.

00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:16.670
And if it's in a country with
hyperinflation, and I don't--

00:25:16.670 --> 00:25:18.650
I hope not-- have
any of you lived

00:25:18.650 --> 00:25:22.320
in a country with hyperinflation
in your lifetimes?

00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:24.340
So five or six of you have.

00:25:24.340 --> 00:25:30.030
So you know what it is like
when you go into a restaurant

00:25:30.030 --> 00:25:31.380
there's one set of pricing.

00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:34.110
But if you eat for too long
and linger at the table,

00:25:34.110 --> 00:25:35.940
it's different level of pricing.

00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:37.303
Literally, right?

00:25:37.303 --> 00:25:38.970
AUDIENCE: You get
your paycheck one day,

00:25:38.970 --> 00:25:41.760
then you have to spend it
as fast as you can, because

00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:47.505
in a week, that's basically a
fraction of what you were paid.

00:25:47.505 --> 00:25:49.880
GARY GENSLER: But from the
view from the top, what Mark--

00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:53.600
one quote from the paper that
I took was that authorities,

00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:54.680
thinking about--

00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:57.620
this is from a public
policy perspective.

00:25:57.620 --> 00:25:59.360
Authorities need
to decide, are you

00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:04.460
going to isolate this world,
regulate it, integrate it?

00:26:04.460 --> 00:26:06.510
Now, some countries--
I don't think anybody's

00:26:06.510 --> 00:26:07.800
fully isolated it.

00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:09.330
But some countries,
in a sense, have

00:26:09.330 --> 00:26:12.210
said, let's ban a
lot of this activity.

00:26:12.210 --> 00:26:14.043
And Kelly?

00:26:14.043 --> 00:26:15.460
AUDIENCE: Can I
ask to what extent

00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:17.740
are other countries looking
to comments like this

00:26:17.740 --> 00:26:21.353
to decide what stance
they're going to take?

00:26:21.353 --> 00:26:22.770
GARY GENSLER:
Kelly's question is,

00:26:22.770 --> 00:26:26.220
so to what extent to comments
from a Mark Carney who's

00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:28.128
the governor of the
Bank of England,

00:26:28.128 --> 00:26:30.420
but heads the Financial
Stability Board-- how much does

00:26:30.420 --> 00:26:35.670
that influence the rest of
the official sector community?

00:26:35.670 --> 00:26:36.880
And it's a great question.

00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:39.030
I think that it all
goes into the mix.

00:26:39.030 --> 00:26:46.620
I think that there's probably
in any public policy sphere

00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:51.030
six to a dozen
countries that really

00:26:51.030 --> 00:26:57.120
take the lead, not legally.

00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:58.620
They're not taking
the lead legally,

00:26:58.620 --> 00:27:01.110
they're just taking
the lead because others

00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:07.090
follow that which is said in the
US, the European Union, China,

00:27:07.090 --> 00:27:08.010
Japan.

00:27:08.010 --> 00:27:13.050
I mean, we know the usual
and the normal countries.

00:27:13.050 --> 00:27:17.010
But part of it is because
the depth and breadth

00:27:17.010 --> 00:27:21.730
of their economies,
part of it in this world

00:27:21.730 --> 00:27:24.370
the depth and breadth of
their financial markets.

00:27:24.370 --> 00:27:27.130
But it's also because
often their opinion

00:27:27.130 --> 00:27:31.720
leaders and their opinions
are somewhat respected.

00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:34.600
But we have 180
or 190 countries.

00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:37.030
And each one of them
has a different culture,

00:27:37.030 --> 00:27:39.130
and each has a different
political system,

00:27:39.130 --> 00:27:43.690
and a different history, and
different economic well-being.

00:27:43.690 --> 00:27:48.760
So I went into the international
arena doing regulation thinking

00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:53.890
it would it is a dystopian
view that there's

00:27:53.890 --> 00:27:58.540
going to be one worldwide regime
for almost any public policy

00:27:58.540 --> 00:28:01.120
issue.

00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:04.790
I mean, I don't know if it
exists in almost any place.

00:28:04.790 --> 00:28:06.880
But when you get to
financial services,

00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:10.690
it's pretty unlikely because
of all those different cultures

00:28:10.690 --> 00:28:14.260
and histories and political
systems and economies

00:28:14.260 --> 00:28:15.680
clashing up against each other.

00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:16.310
Yes?

00:28:16.310 --> 00:28:18.560
AUDIENCE: I was just wondering
if you can explain more

00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:22.480
about what you mean by
China leading the effort--

00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:23.620
GARY GENSLER: China's--

00:28:23.620 --> 00:28:26.800
AUDIENCE: Is leading the effort
in regulating the blockchain,

00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:30.130
because China has banned
the exchange of Fiat

00:28:30.130 --> 00:28:31.550
money [INAUDIBLE].

00:28:31.550 --> 00:28:34.400
GARY GENSLER: So the
question is China.

00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:40.930
So how many in the room think
China would be in the isolate--

00:28:40.930 --> 00:28:43.540
dominantly in the isolate
category rather than

00:28:43.540 --> 00:28:47.350
the integrate category?

00:28:47.350 --> 00:28:49.170
So a quarter or a third.

00:28:49.170 --> 00:28:49.890
It's interesting.

00:28:49.890 --> 00:28:50.970
It's really a hybrid.

00:28:50.970 --> 00:28:56.800
China came pretty strongly
saying no to a lot of activity.

00:28:56.800 --> 00:29:00.390
And yet, two of the biggest
mining poles for Bitcoin

00:29:00.390 --> 00:29:02.430
are in China.

00:29:02.430 --> 00:29:05.340
Some of the crypto
exchanges left China,

00:29:05.340 --> 00:29:09.180
but those miners are the
biggest sellers of Bitcoin,

00:29:09.180 --> 00:29:10.890
because they're
collecting the Bitcoin

00:29:10.890 --> 00:29:14.790
and need to sell them, have
to find some crypto exchange

00:29:14.790 --> 00:29:18.390
somewhere that is
no longer in China.

00:29:18.390 --> 00:29:20.610
I'm going to mispronounce
the name of the exchange.

00:29:20.610 --> 00:29:28.320
But Huobi, H-U-O-B-I, is still
very much a Chinese crypto

00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:29.160
exchange.

00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:31.980
I think it's now
registered in Malta

00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:34.940
if I'm not mistaken maybe.

00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:39.390
So there's a love-hate hybrid.

00:29:39.390 --> 00:29:43.680
The Central Bank of China
has very active projects

00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:46.620
with regard to
blockchain technology.

00:29:46.620 --> 00:29:50.290
And they have a whole
lab and it's public.

00:29:50.290 --> 00:29:52.170
That which is public is public.

00:29:52.170 --> 00:29:54.150
That which is private
probably is bigger

00:29:54.150 --> 00:29:55.960
and we just don't know about it.

00:29:55.960 --> 00:30:01.560
So there's a bit of a mixed
approach even in China,

00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:05.370
if that answers your question.

00:30:05.370 --> 00:30:07.770
So let me just go--

00:30:07.770 --> 00:30:10.200
I've spent a lot of time
in the last six months

00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:11.850
traveling around the
globe and speaking

00:30:11.850 --> 00:30:17.760
at different conferences, OECD,
in Japan, and here in the US.

00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:20.940
What I see-- guarding
against illicit activity,

00:30:20.940 --> 00:30:22.470
broad consensus.

00:30:22.470 --> 00:30:26.190
180-190 countries, yeah,
we've got to do it.

00:30:26.190 --> 00:30:30.560
Really choppy performance
on implementation,

00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:34.310
and sometimes a little bit of a
head fake from one jurisdiction

00:30:34.310 --> 00:30:36.080
to another, because
some actually

00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:38.690
are fine with tax
evasion as long as it's

00:30:38.690 --> 00:30:43.090
tax evasion in the other
person's jurisdiction.

00:30:43.090 --> 00:30:46.270
Usually, low
population centers are

00:30:46.270 --> 00:30:49.720
more comfortable promoting
being tax havens,

00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:53.480
trying to take economic
activity from elsewhere.

00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:55.720
But there's general
broad consensus

00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:58.390
and it's usually centered
on finance ministries

00:30:58.390 --> 00:31:01.690
and central bank authorities
and the equivalent

00:31:01.690 --> 00:31:04.930
of law enforcement,
our Justice Department.

00:31:04.930 --> 00:31:05.650
Think of those.

00:31:05.650 --> 00:31:09.930
That's where the nexus is
happening country by country.

00:31:09.930 --> 00:31:14.100
Financial stability, general
consensus to monitor--

00:31:14.100 --> 00:31:17.130
there's not a deep
worry right now,

00:31:17.130 --> 00:31:21.270
because the space is only a
quarter of a trillion dollars.

00:31:21.270 --> 00:31:23.880
And the worldwide
capital markets--

00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:26.820
the worldwide debt
markets are $250 trillion,

00:31:26.820 --> 00:31:29.760
nearly 1,000 times bigger.

00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:33.960
And the worldwide equity
markets are about $90 trillion.

00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:38.700
And even the worldwide stock
of gold, at $7 trillion,

00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:42.450
is nearly 30 times as large.

00:31:42.450 --> 00:31:48.540
It just gives you a sense of
the relationship right now why

00:31:48.540 --> 00:31:53.790
let's monitor, but it's probably
not systemic destabilizing.

00:31:53.790 --> 00:31:55.860
However, there's
different perspectives,

00:31:55.860 --> 00:31:58.920
particularly in countries
that have capital controls,

00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:02.400
because it could be
destabilizing to a currency

00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:03.720
in that way.

00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:05.940
And then thirdly, the
investing public--

00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:07.470
protecting investing
public, I would

00:32:07.470 --> 00:32:10.050
say the views are wide ranging.

00:32:10.050 --> 00:32:12.720
In the US and
Canada, more forward

00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:16.560
leaning, more a
lot of this stuff--

00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:18.900
maybe these initial
coin offerings

00:32:18.900 --> 00:32:23.340
are securities that
need to be protected.

00:32:23.340 --> 00:32:24.960
And in a bunch of
other countries,

00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:28.590
it's like let 1,000
flowers bloom.

00:32:28.590 --> 00:32:30.960
Let's promote
innovation and so forth.

00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:34.470
And it's a pretty wide view.

00:32:34.470 --> 00:32:37.860
My personal view is, and I've
said this at some conferences,

00:32:37.860 --> 00:32:48.020
if this grew from a quarter of
a to five and 10 and 20 times

00:32:48.020 --> 00:32:52.070
the size, or if the ICO
marketplace, which has raised

00:32:52.070 --> 00:32:57.130
about $20 to $25 billion
today, kept raising that

00:32:57.130 --> 00:33:00.140
but went to like $100
billion a year raise,

00:33:00.140 --> 00:33:01.860
then a bunch of
countries would probably

00:33:01.860 --> 00:33:04.020
want more investor protection.

00:33:04.020 --> 00:33:07.330
I think-- this is just
my personal view--

00:33:07.330 --> 00:33:11.970
we will never have uniform
jurisdiction, uniform laws.

00:33:11.970 --> 00:33:14.610
But part of what's going
on is this is so new

00:33:14.610 --> 00:33:19.150
and it's still relatively small
versus the capital markets.

00:33:19.150 --> 00:33:22.110
If it grew, I think
more countries

00:33:22.110 --> 00:33:24.633
would want some protection.

00:33:24.633 --> 00:33:27.050
AUDIENCE: I have a question
regarding the illicit equities

00:33:27.050 --> 00:33:28.505
and financial stability.

00:33:28.505 --> 00:33:29.880
As you traveled
to other country,

00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:34.050
what metrics were they using
to measure their success

00:33:34.050 --> 00:33:36.215
or monitor on those fronts?

00:33:36.215 --> 00:33:38.340
GARY GENSLER: So the question
is what are countries

00:33:38.340 --> 00:33:40.377
doing to measure for success.

00:33:40.377 --> 00:33:42.210
I'm going to use one
example, and then we'll

00:33:42.210 --> 00:33:44.220
keep going into the details.

00:33:44.220 --> 00:33:49.350
Japan had some of the
earliest crypto exchanges, Mt.

00:33:49.350 --> 00:33:51.660
Gox, G-O-X. Mt.

00:33:51.660 --> 00:33:56.190
Gox was an early exchange
that the promoters, the owners

00:33:56.190 --> 00:34:01.080
moved to Tokyo, even though
they weren't Japanese nationals.

00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:04.530
So it was it was
centered in Tokyo.

00:34:04.530 --> 00:34:08.760
And it went down when about
half a billion dollars of value

00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:09.960
was lost.

00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:14.460
It was supposedly a
hack, stolen crypto.

00:34:14.460 --> 00:34:16.480
It was aan interesting case.

00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:18.929
It was actually being
stolen over many months.

00:34:18.929 --> 00:34:21.480
It wasn't one specific hack.

00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:27.659
So Japan in 2017 finally got
around and changed their laws.

00:34:27.659 --> 00:34:33.100
And they put in a whole regime
to regulate crypto exchanges,

00:34:33.100 --> 00:34:37.530
particularly around this
customer protection custody

00:34:37.530 --> 00:34:40.139
issue and around
illicit activity.

00:34:40.139 --> 00:34:43.020
And they actually have
gone in and asked exchanges

00:34:43.020 --> 00:34:44.250
to register.

00:34:44.250 --> 00:34:49.350
They go in and actually
do examinations.

00:34:49.350 --> 00:34:51.540
And earlier this
year, of the, I think,

00:34:51.540 --> 00:34:54.449
30 some registered
exchanges, five

00:34:54.449 --> 00:34:57.780
or 10 had to cease operations.

00:34:57.780 --> 00:35:01.420
How do they measure
success or failure?

00:35:01.420 --> 00:35:03.630
Another exchange in
January of this year

00:35:03.630 --> 00:35:07.770
lost another half a
billion dollars to a hack.

00:35:07.770 --> 00:35:12.030
Their principal executive,
their prime minister,

00:35:12.030 --> 00:35:14.340
got a question in
a news conference.

00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:18.670
If you're a regulator,
that's not a good thing.

00:35:18.670 --> 00:35:22.980
So sometimes, you measure
success or failure

00:35:22.980 --> 00:35:28.440
as to whether your boss gets a
question in a news conference

00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:30.390
about why it's not working.

00:35:30.390 --> 00:35:32.760
The Japanese have been
terrific, by the way,

00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:35.110
in terms of what they're doing.

00:35:35.110 --> 00:35:38.400
But I'm just using that as
an example of sometimes.

00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:44.060
So let me just chat about a
deep dive into each of these

00:35:44.060 --> 00:35:46.800
in probably five
or 10 minutes each,

00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:49.800
which you could do a whole
course on each of these.

00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:51.990
But let me just deep
dive a little bit.

00:35:51.990 --> 00:35:55.590
Guarding against
illicit activity--

00:35:55.590 --> 00:35:59.550
so tax compliance and
reporting, what do you

00:35:59.550 --> 00:36:02.100
think the first big question
that the US government

00:36:02.100 --> 00:36:04.980
or any government--
this sounds US-centric.

00:36:04.980 --> 00:36:06.750
And Kelly, I thank
you for your paper,

00:36:06.750 --> 00:36:08.925
because Kelly-- is
it all right if I

00:36:08.925 --> 00:36:11.175
call you out-- wrote a paper
for today, which I happen

00:36:11.175 --> 00:36:14.400
to read earlier today and
said Gensler's work was

00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:15.345
too US-centric.

00:36:17.657 --> 00:36:18.615
I thought it was gutsy.

00:36:18.615 --> 00:36:19.760
I thought it was gutsy.

00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:20.580
But you're right.

00:36:20.580 --> 00:36:21.780
It was US-centric.

00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:25.050
I was speaking to
the US Congress.

00:36:25.050 --> 00:36:27.270
So that was this thing you
learn in politics, too.

00:36:27.270 --> 00:36:29.780
You try to gauge your audience.

00:36:29.780 --> 00:36:31.230
But you were right.

00:36:31.230 --> 00:36:33.330
But what do you
think the first thing

00:36:33.330 --> 00:36:35.600
whether it's the US government
or any government's got

00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:40.800
to figure out in terms of this
world came along in 2010, 2011,

00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:44.910
2012-- what was that
first question, which

00:36:44.910 --> 00:36:46.740
you may have teased
out of the readings,

00:36:46.740 --> 00:36:49.670
but as a policy question?

00:36:49.670 --> 00:36:53.610
Anybody want to take a guess?

00:36:53.610 --> 00:36:56.505
AUDIENCE: How do you
treat it for tax purposes?

00:36:56.505 --> 00:36:58.630
GARY GENSLER: How do you
treat it for tax purposes?

00:36:58.630 --> 00:37:04.130
How do you treat Bitcoin at
the time for tax purposes?

00:37:04.130 --> 00:37:06.620
And so that central
question was the first thing

00:37:06.620 --> 00:37:08.060
that really came up.

00:37:08.060 --> 00:37:09.170
Is it a currency?

00:37:09.170 --> 00:37:10.640
Is it a form of property?

00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:12.350
Is it something else?

00:37:12.350 --> 00:37:16.460
What did the US government say
back in, I think it was 2013?

00:37:16.460 --> 00:37:19.580
But it would it be
in the testimony.

00:37:19.580 --> 00:37:20.090
What is it?

00:37:20.090 --> 00:37:22.130
Is it a currency or property?

00:37:22.130 --> 00:37:22.940
AUDIENCE: Property.

00:37:22.940 --> 00:37:23.720
GARY GENSLER: Property.

00:37:23.720 --> 00:37:25.137
AUDIENCE: It makes
for a pain when

00:37:25.137 --> 00:37:27.740
you're filling out your taxes
and you do any sort of trading.

00:37:27.740 --> 00:37:28.865
GARY GENSLER: That's right.

00:37:28.865 --> 00:37:31.453
So the result of that is--
you want to say it again?

00:37:31.453 --> 00:37:32.870
AUDIENCE: You have
to-- basically,

00:37:32.870 --> 00:37:36.140
every time you exchange
to another currency

00:37:36.140 --> 00:37:40.660
or you spend it, you have
to record the cost basis.

00:37:40.660 --> 00:37:43.240
And yeah, if you do any
sort of my tax return,

00:37:43.240 --> 00:37:44.860
was 600 pages this year.

00:37:44.860 --> 00:37:46.940
it's pretty brutal.

00:37:46.940 --> 00:37:50.690
So any time it changes at
all, you can't consolidate--

00:37:50.690 --> 00:37:53.360
I think it's like with
stocks you can consolidate.

00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:55.820
If it's the same security
being traded over the year,

00:37:55.820 --> 00:37:59.390
you can consolidate to show
your beginning and ending

00:37:59.390 --> 00:38:01.050
and just pay tax on the delta.

00:38:01.050 --> 00:38:03.952
But you have to report
every single trade.

00:38:03.952 --> 00:38:05.660
GARY GENSLER: So these
types of questions

00:38:05.660 --> 00:38:08.900
were not known in 2008
when Satoshi Nakamoto wrote

00:38:08.900 --> 00:38:09.440
his paper.

00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:13.550
But 10 years later, is it
currency, is it property?

00:38:13.550 --> 00:38:17.300
Some jurisdictions around
the globe, very few but some,

00:38:17.300 --> 00:38:20.040
have said its currency.

00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:22.840
But almost dominantly
around the globe,

00:38:22.840 --> 00:38:26.340
it's some form of property,
and then within the laws

00:38:26.340 --> 00:38:27.990
triggers, like it
does in the US,

00:38:27.990 --> 00:38:31.210
capital gains and
so forth like that.

00:38:31.210 --> 00:38:34.000
The next quote set
of questions was,

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:38.110
what's the tax treatment of
mining, exchanges, and forks?

00:38:38.110 --> 00:38:40.120
Anybody want to tell me--

00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:45.580
if you're mining and you receive
Bitcoin or any other crypto,

00:38:45.580 --> 00:38:50.290
Ether, and so forth--

00:38:50.290 --> 00:38:52.130
anybody want to take a guess?

00:38:52.130 --> 00:38:53.070
It's not a guess.

00:38:53.070 --> 00:38:55.660
I think it was even in
the testimony I wrote.

00:38:55.660 --> 00:38:57.455
You had 600 pages.

00:38:57.455 --> 00:38:58.955
AUDIENCE: I know
with a fork anyway,

00:38:58.955 --> 00:39:00.780
you basically pay tax
on the whole thing.

00:39:00.780 --> 00:39:06.040
So a Bitcoin cash fork,
basically the cost basis

00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:09.650
is zero, and whatever its
value at the time you sell it.

00:39:09.650 --> 00:39:11.650
GARY GENSLER: You're
saying you had to pay taxes

00:39:11.650 --> 00:39:13.190
on both sides of the fork?

00:39:13.190 --> 00:39:13.930
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:39:13.930 --> 00:39:16.540
GARY GENSLER: So that's
rougher than a stock split.

00:39:16.540 --> 00:39:19.360
A stock split, you
just carryover basis.

00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:20.610
How about Bitcoin mining?

00:39:20.610 --> 00:39:21.110
Anybody?

00:39:21.110 --> 00:39:22.722
Zan, you want to take it?

00:39:22.722 --> 00:39:24.430
AUDIENCE: I actually
don't know this one,

00:39:24.430 --> 00:39:27.235
but I would assume they
treat it like income.

00:39:27.235 --> 00:39:28.110
GARY GENSLER: Income.

00:39:28.110 --> 00:39:28.960
Zan's right.

00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:30.160
It's income.

00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:32.620
You mine, you get income.

00:39:32.620 --> 00:39:37.660
So each of these had to be
addressed in the tax law.

00:39:37.660 --> 00:39:40.140
The next thing is something
called the Bank Secrecy Act.

00:39:40.140 --> 00:39:43.870
Anybody want to tell me what
the Bank Secrecy Act is?

00:39:43.870 --> 00:39:46.030
Is it Nicholas?

00:39:46.030 --> 00:39:49.763
See, I can read your name
there and see how that worked.

00:39:49.763 --> 00:39:51.180
AUDIENCE: I'm not
sure what it is.

00:39:51.180 --> 00:39:52.638
GARY GENSLER: OK,
that's all right.

00:39:52.638 --> 00:39:56.490
Bank Secrecy Act was passed
a few decades ago so probably

00:39:56.490 --> 00:39:58.320
before most of us in this room--

00:39:58.320 --> 00:40:00.870
after I was born, but
most of you were born.

00:40:00.870 --> 00:40:05.370
Anybody want to say what
the Bank Secrecy Act is?

00:40:05.370 --> 00:40:06.060
Daniel?

00:40:06.060 --> 00:40:09.020
AUDIENCE: Is it the Bank Secrecy
Act that deals with KYC and AML

00:40:09.020 --> 00:40:10.610
and essentially
knowing the parties

00:40:10.610 --> 00:40:11.920
that you're interacting with?

00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:12.570
GARY GENSLER: Correct.

00:40:12.570 --> 00:40:13.195
That's correct.

00:40:13.195 --> 00:40:17.220
It's really trying to protect
against secret transactions

00:40:17.220 --> 00:40:20.640
or what's often called
money laundering.

00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:22.740
And behind the money
laundering laws

00:40:22.740 --> 00:40:25.290
is knowing who the
customer is of a bank.

00:40:25.290 --> 00:40:29.750
So you'll hear these letters,
KYC, know your customer;

00:40:29.750 --> 00:40:33.430
AML, anti-money laundering.

00:40:33.430 --> 00:40:35.710
And the Bank Secrecy
Act, underneath it then,

00:40:35.710 --> 00:40:38.110
has reporting
obligations that anyone

00:40:38.110 --> 00:40:41.350
who has to report under
the Bank Secrecy Act

00:40:41.350 --> 00:40:45.040
has to report when there's
large transactions.

00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:49.060
If you go into the bank and
you ask them, can you please--

00:40:49.060 --> 00:40:54.190
I want to take a withdraw
of $11,000 of US currency.

00:40:54.190 --> 00:40:56.560
They have to fill out
a report, because I

00:40:56.560 --> 00:40:59.470
believe the triggers $10,000.

00:40:59.470 --> 00:41:03.630
You walk in and you
get $500, no report.

00:41:03.630 --> 00:41:06.960
But there's various
suspicious activity reporting

00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:09.510
and other large
transaction reporting

00:41:09.510 --> 00:41:12.085
that gets triggered in
the US Bank Secrecy Act.

00:41:12.085 --> 00:41:13.710
But you will hear
over and over again--

00:41:13.710 --> 00:41:16.830
even if you never invest or
work in a blockchain company,

00:41:16.830 --> 00:41:20.100
you will hear something
called KYC and AML.

00:41:20.100 --> 00:41:25.920
And it's these two
regimes that kind of work.

00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:29.430
They're not the best,
but they do their job

00:41:29.430 --> 00:41:32.470
to give the official sector
and the banking sector

00:41:32.470 --> 00:41:36.430
a sense of who owns the
accounts and when there's

00:41:36.430 --> 00:41:40.300
suspicious activity that
there's a reporting obligation

00:41:40.300 --> 00:41:41.890
into the authorities.

00:41:41.890 --> 00:41:42.390
Aline?

00:41:42.390 --> 00:41:45.310
AUDIENCE: So how do anonymous
cryptocurrencies fit in here?

00:41:45.310 --> 00:41:48.750
I suppose at the exchange
level you do KYC and AML.

00:41:48.750 --> 00:41:52.520
GARY GENSLER: So Aline is asking
how does everything fit in.

00:41:52.520 --> 00:41:55.150
So how does money transmission
laws-- money transmission

00:41:55.150 --> 00:41:58.930
laws are the laws that were
just mentioned by Daniel,

00:41:58.930 --> 00:42:00.520
the anti-money laundering.

00:42:00.520 --> 00:42:04.090
CTF is counter-terrorism
finance.

00:42:04.090 --> 00:42:08.170
I mean, Washington is a
world full of these letters

00:42:08.170 --> 00:42:10.750
and jargon and everything.

00:42:10.750 --> 00:42:11.980
So how does it fit in?

00:42:11.980 --> 00:42:16.600
It first is one of the things in
the US Department of Treasury--

00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:18.640
but again, to
internationalize it--

00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:21.970
other departments of treasury
and so forth around the globe

00:42:21.970 --> 00:42:27.330
define when do you come
under the similar laws.

00:42:27.330 --> 00:42:30.760
When are you just a
user of this property,

00:42:30.760 --> 00:42:32.470
because it's not a currency?

00:42:32.470 --> 00:42:35.140
But to confuse matters, the
US Department of treasury

00:42:35.140 --> 00:42:39.670
said it was a virtual currency,
a virtual currency which

00:42:39.670 --> 00:42:42.580
happens to be
property for tax law.

00:42:42.580 --> 00:42:44.500
This is two parts of
the same department.

00:42:44.500 --> 00:42:46.600
The US Department of
treasury said it's property

00:42:46.600 --> 00:42:47.800
not currency.

00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:51.410
Another part of the US Treasury
said it's virtual currency.

00:42:51.410 --> 00:42:54.010
And the reason they had to
say it was virtual currency

00:42:54.010 --> 00:42:58.780
is they wanted it to come under
this law, the Bank Secrecy Act,

00:42:58.780 --> 00:43:01.950
without going probably to
Congress to have it be amended.

00:43:01.950 --> 00:43:04.050
Hugo?

00:43:04.050 --> 00:43:05.560
AUDIENCE: So
cryptocurrency is given

00:43:05.560 --> 00:43:09.610
a bad rap for money
laundering, but what

00:43:09.610 --> 00:43:14.410
about [INAUDIBLE]
this year, I think

00:43:14.410 --> 00:43:18.490
some bank was fined for money
laundering over $200 billion.

00:43:18.490 --> 00:43:20.740
And the amount of money going
through crypto exchanges

00:43:20.740 --> 00:43:22.617
is in the maybe $10 million.

00:43:22.617 --> 00:43:24.450
GARY GENSLER: So Hugo's
asking the question,

00:43:24.450 --> 00:43:27.430
well, wait, crypto is getting
a bad rap for money laundering,

00:43:27.430 --> 00:43:28.820
what about everything else?

00:43:28.820 --> 00:43:31.300
And I'd say, yes, what
Hugo is reminding us

00:43:31.300 --> 00:43:35.290
of is criminals don't change,
just the technologies they

00:43:35.290 --> 00:43:36.460
use do change.

00:43:36.460 --> 00:43:40.870
But they're still using bags
of cash in some jurisdictions

00:43:40.870 --> 00:43:46.010
and there's still suitcases and
cast drops around the globe.

00:43:46.010 --> 00:43:50.440
I'm told that there's even now
some trafficking between crypto

00:43:50.440 --> 00:43:53.260
and physical cash
where couriers can

00:43:53.260 --> 00:43:58.660
be paid a certain percentage
to take suitcases of cash

00:43:58.660 --> 00:44:02.450
from, let's say, drug
runners on the one hand

00:44:02.450 --> 00:44:05.800
and exchange them a thumb drive
or a private key with Bitcoin

00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:09.700
on the other, so just
new means and methods.

00:44:09.700 --> 00:44:10.600
Sorry?

00:44:10.600 --> 00:44:12.740
AUDIENCE: I would
just reply that I

00:44:12.740 --> 00:44:15.770
would say that the amount
that that bank was charged

00:44:15.770 --> 00:44:17.660
was probably a
small portion of it,

00:44:17.660 --> 00:44:22.100
whereas there is probably a
higher proportion potentially

00:44:22.100 --> 00:44:26.387
of cryptocurrency
that has illicit uses.

00:44:26.387 --> 00:44:28.220
GARY GENSLER: So
Christopher is saying maybe

00:44:28.220 --> 00:44:30.860
there's a higher
percentage of crypto

00:44:30.860 --> 00:44:35.060
that's being used for illicit
than the percent of Fiat.

00:44:35.060 --> 00:44:37.700
That may well be correct,
because the world's stock

00:44:37.700 --> 00:44:41.150
of Fiat is measured in
the tens of trillions.

00:44:41.150 --> 00:44:44.460
But that may be, but it's
still something that concerns,

00:44:44.460 --> 00:44:51.200
because like water wants
to find the lowest level

00:44:51.200 --> 00:44:55.610
and will drain up
wherever the leak is,

00:44:55.610 --> 00:44:59.570
illicit activity will flow
to wherever the lowest level.

00:44:59.570 --> 00:45:02.500
So the challenges, the
key challenges-- you all

00:45:02.500 --> 00:45:05.330
have raised many of these, so
I'm not going to ask questions.

00:45:05.330 --> 00:45:07.880
But the pseudonymous
addresses, that is

00:45:07.880 --> 00:45:11.660
a real challenge for law
enforcement around the globe.

00:45:11.660 --> 00:45:16.400
Privacy coins, like what we
talked about Zcash and Monaro

00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:21.830
and so forth, that have
a cryptographic method

00:45:21.830 --> 00:45:24.440
to make it harder to track.

00:45:27.030 --> 00:45:29.540
And then compliance
and reporting,

00:45:29.540 --> 00:45:32.030
there just isn't a lot
of-- even well meaning

00:45:32.030 --> 00:45:36.020
people don't often comply
and put in the 600 pages.

00:45:36.020 --> 00:45:36.960
The US government.

00:45:36.960 --> 00:45:38.130
Thanks you.

00:45:38.130 --> 00:45:40.310
AUDIENCE: I'm waiting
for my audit to come.

00:45:40.310 --> 00:45:41.393
GARY GENSLER: What's that?

00:45:41.393 --> 00:45:43.250
You're waiting for
your audit to come.

00:45:43.250 --> 00:45:47.030
I would say the other
challenges are also--

00:45:47.030 --> 00:45:49.310
these are the things that
the regulators and law

00:45:49.310 --> 00:45:50.720
enforcement talk about.

00:45:50.720 --> 00:45:52.910
Crypto to crypto
transactions are

00:45:52.910 --> 00:45:56.000
a little bit more challenging
than crypto to Fiat.

00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:59.440
Does anybody want to--

00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:00.810
Zan, why?

00:46:00.810 --> 00:46:03.510
AUDIENCE: It seems to me that,
from a regulator perspective,

00:46:03.510 --> 00:46:07.800
it's fairly easy to regulate
and monitor the on-ramps

00:46:07.800 --> 00:46:08.780
and off-ramps, right?

00:46:08.780 --> 00:46:11.460
So when you're dealing with
financial intermediaries,

00:46:11.460 --> 00:46:13.530
you're essentially
bringing Fiat into crypto

00:46:13.530 --> 00:46:14.940
and you can monitor
a transaction

00:46:14.940 --> 00:46:15.857
or if it's coming out.

00:46:15.857 --> 00:46:18.960
But what happens within the
ecosystem, especially when you

00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:21.420
bring in Monaro and some
of these privacy coins,

00:46:21.420 --> 00:46:22.470
regulators have no idea.

00:46:22.470 --> 00:46:24.240
So it's really hard.

00:46:24.240 --> 00:46:27.510
GARY GENSLER: So this term,
on-ramps and off-ramps

00:46:27.510 --> 00:46:32.100
I've heard a lot, not
just from Zan, but that's

00:46:32.100 --> 00:46:34.350
how law enforcement
thinks about it.

00:46:34.350 --> 00:46:37.950
Because they're regulating
the intermediary caught-backs,

00:46:37.950 --> 00:46:41.840
back to the discussion we
had about 30 minutes ago,

00:46:41.840 --> 00:46:46.220
regulated intermediaries
give the official sector

00:46:46.220 --> 00:46:49.940
a node to influence behavior.

00:46:49.940 --> 00:46:54.500
They have the banks, the JP
Morgans and the small community

00:46:54.500 --> 00:47:00.080
banks, in this system of
Bank Secrecy Act compliance.

00:47:00.080 --> 00:47:03.920
And even though some are doing
sloppy work, as Hugo pointed

00:47:03.920 --> 00:47:07.080
out, they're in the system.

00:47:07.080 --> 00:47:11.750
And so crypto to crypto is
harder for the official sector,

00:47:11.750 --> 00:47:16.110
because they don't need
any commercial bank.

00:47:16.110 --> 00:47:18.350
Or in a sense,
crypto to crypto is

00:47:18.350 --> 00:47:23.270
easier for somebody that wants
to stay off the tax base,

00:47:23.270 --> 00:47:26.820
because there's not
the same reporting.

00:47:26.820 --> 00:47:31.060
So it depends on which side
of the lens you're on as well.

00:47:31.060 --> 00:47:34.220
Decentralized exchanges
we're going to talk about

00:47:34.220 --> 00:47:37.430
in about five or six classes.

00:47:37.430 --> 00:47:41.740
But trust me, they're harder
for the official sector.

00:47:41.740 --> 00:47:44.050
Decentralized exchanges
are basically--

00:47:44.050 --> 00:47:48.390
think of an algorithm
that is decentralized,

00:47:48.390 --> 00:47:50.310
no central intermediary.

00:47:50.310 --> 00:47:53.880
But through an
algorithm, Ilan and I

00:47:53.880 --> 00:47:58.360
could trade Bitcoin versus
Ether, Ether versus Bitcoin.

00:47:58.360 --> 00:48:02.030
And this decentralized
exchange allows it to happen.

00:48:02.030 --> 00:48:08.620
Most of them right now are
between two tokens that

00:48:08.620 --> 00:48:14.610
are on Ethereum, so Ethereum
token into Ethereum, token two

00:48:14.610 --> 00:48:16.570
ICO tokens.

00:48:16.570 --> 00:48:20.410
But they're a real challenge
and we'll get to them later.

00:48:20.410 --> 00:48:23.470
Anybody know what
a dark market is?

00:48:23.470 --> 00:48:25.960
I'm not going to ask if
anybody's used a dark market.

00:48:25.960 --> 00:48:27.040
Don't worry.

00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:28.318
Does anybody know?

00:48:28.318 --> 00:48:29.950
AUDIENCE: I think
like the Silk Road.

00:48:29.950 --> 00:48:31.040
GARY GENSLER: Silk Road.

00:48:31.040 --> 00:48:32.260
It is Silk Road.

00:48:32.260 --> 00:48:34.435
But what is Silk Road?

00:48:34.435 --> 00:48:38.350
AUDIENCE: It was somebody
using the deep web.

00:48:38.350 --> 00:48:40.960
The guy's in jail right now.

00:48:40.960 --> 00:48:44.410
And he had the
idea of free trade

00:48:44.410 --> 00:48:48.790
and it was used
for drugs mainly.

00:48:48.790 --> 00:48:51.400
GARY GENSLER: So it's
basically a website where

00:48:51.400 --> 00:48:54.700
you can buy and
sell illegal things,

00:48:54.700 --> 00:48:58.120
not just drugs but
primarily drugs.

00:48:58.120 --> 00:49:03.340
And the payments were
generally in Bitcoin,

00:49:03.340 --> 00:49:06.850
even though some have
moved on from Bitcoin now.

00:49:06.850 --> 00:49:09.460
And the technology
they were using

00:49:09.460 --> 00:49:15.670
was a TOR, T-O-R, which
is a way that you could

00:49:15.670 --> 00:49:18.370
do communications on the
web and not be tracked,

00:49:18.370 --> 00:49:21.850
I mean broadly speaking.

00:49:21.850 --> 00:49:23.230
So that was Silk Road.

00:49:23.230 --> 00:49:25.640
And dark markets exist.

00:49:25.640 --> 00:49:28.390
Again, before Bitcoin,
dark markets exist.

00:49:28.390 --> 00:49:30.190
They might have been
called black markets.

00:49:30.190 --> 00:49:31.320
So they have a new name.

00:49:31.320 --> 00:49:33.160
They're a new technology.

00:49:33.160 --> 00:49:36.100
And then state actors--

00:49:36.100 --> 00:49:39.880
and no one should doubt
that state actors are always

00:49:39.880 --> 00:49:43.910
in some competition
with each other.

00:49:43.910 --> 00:49:45.670
And even if we're
not in a hot war,

00:49:45.670 --> 00:49:49.700
sometimes you're in other
types of competition.

00:49:49.700 --> 00:49:52.690
And so state actors
are also using--

00:49:52.690 --> 00:49:57.580
and not just like the Mueller
investigation saw that--

00:49:57.580 --> 00:50:00.580
they alleged that Russians
were using Bitcoin

00:50:00.580 --> 00:50:04.010
to mess in our elections.

00:50:04.010 --> 00:50:06.340
But in a more broad
sense, state actors

00:50:06.340 --> 00:50:09.040
could play in this space.

00:50:09.040 --> 00:50:10.950
I just thought this
chart was interesting.

00:50:10.950 --> 00:50:13.140
I found it on a website.

00:50:13.140 --> 00:50:14.020
Diar did a report.

00:50:14.020 --> 00:50:18.070
But this is US Agency Contracts
for Blockchain Analysis.

00:50:18.070 --> 00:50:21.430
There's companies out there
that will go in and do

00:50:21.430 --> 00:50:23.700
the forensics and analysis.

00:50:23.700 --> 00:50:26.260
And here is the
highest agencies.

00:50:26.260 --> 00:50:29.440
These numbers aren't
terribly relevant

00:50:29.440 --> 00:50:32.890
that it's $2 million or $2.5
million, but it's interesting.

00:50:32.890 --> 00:50:38.560
It's the IRS, it's the customs,
FBI, and the Fiscal Services,

00:50:38.560 --> 00:50:40.660
and the Drug Enforcement Agency.

00:50:40.660 --> 00:50:43.960
That's the parts of the
US that have publicly

00:50:43.960 --> 00:50:48.730
done requests for contracts
so this outside service could

00:50:48.730 --> 00:50:49.370
track it.

00:50:49.370 --> 00:50:52.060
But it just gives a
flavor for who's chasing

00:50:52.060 --> 00:50:55.000
after Bitcoin usage in the US.

00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:58.110
It's wonderful transparency.

00:50:58.110 --> 00:50:59.437
That's illicit activity.

00:50:59.437 --> 00:51:01.020
Let me move on to
financial stability,

00:51:01.020 --> 00:51:04.110
because we're going
to run out of time.

00:51:04.110 --> 00:51:07.350
Financial stability--
the initial assessment

00:51:07.350 --> 00:51:12.580
of the Financial Stability
Board is not big enough yet.

00:51:12.580 --> 00:51:15.430
I would say though, again,
capital control companies

00:51:15.430 --> 00:51:17.620
are worried about
maintaining stability.

00:51:17.620 --> 00:51:22.420
That's if it could undermine
your currency value.

00:51:22.420 --> 00:51:26.410
In essence, a capital
control country,

00:51:26.410 --> 00:51:29.510
where China has some capital
controls for instance,

00:51:29.510 --> 00:51:33.010
you can't get a lot
of the currency out.

00:51:33.010 --> 00:51:40.530
But if you can go Renminbi to
Bitcoin, Bitcoin to dollar,

00:51:40.530 --> 00:51:42.990
then it's basically
a bridge currency

00:51:42.990 --> 00:51:45.060
to avoid capital controls.

00:51:45.060 --> 00:51:47.400
And one of the things I
understand the Bank of China

00:51:47.400 --> 00:51:52.200
is focused on is that with
the big miners in China

00:51:52.200 --> 00:51:54.900
that, in essence, the
mining operations are a way

00:51:54.900 --> 00:51:57.270
to get around capital controls.

00:51:57.270 --> 00:52:02.490
It's a way to change Renminbi
into electricity, electricity

00:52:02.490 --> 00:52:06.825
into Bitcoin, Bitcoin
into dollars or euros.

00:52:10.480 --> 00:52:13.810
But it may also be why some
local officials in China

00:52:13.810 --> 00:52:17.750
apparently are allowing
the mining to continue.

00:52:17.750 --> 00:52:21.380
And while I don't have
any documented proof,

00:52:21.380 --> 00:52:23.540
it's why some people think
that there's probably

00:52:23.540 --> 00:52:27.560
some arrangements with
these local officials.

00:52:31.620 --> 00:52:34.440
I mentioned three other
areas in the testimony

00:52:34.440 --> 00:52:38.190
that I think are on the horizon
that are worth thinking about.

00:52:38.190 --> 00:52:41.400
Crypto leverage-- a lot
of the crypto exchanges

00:52:41.400 --> 00:52:42.850
provide a lot of leverage.

00:52:42.850 --> 00:52:48.000
You can buy Bitcoin, in
some cases 100 to 1 levered.

00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:53.180
Most or not at 100 to 1, but
almost all are at least 10 to 1

00:52:53.180 --> 00:52:55.370
says our trader, right?

00:52:55.370 --> 00:52:58.040
So leverage often
is where you can

00:52:58.040 --> 00:53:02.300
get more acceleration
of a crisis

00:53:02.300 --> 00:53:07.220
if it's already happening,
more systemic risk.

00:53:07.220 --> 00:53:09.290
This still is a
rather small market,

00:53:09.290 --> 00:53:11.030
but the leverages,
probably something

00:53:11.030 --> 00:53:15.140
could propagate any crisis
if it were to happen.

00:53:15.140 --> 00:53:16.940
The market
infrastructure itself,

00:53:16.940 --> 00:53:20.870
like Australia is using
blockchain technology

00:53:20.870 --> 00:53:24.663
to do their clearing and
settlement of stocks.

00:53:24.663 --> 00:53:26.330
They haven't adopted
it yet, but they're

00:53:26.330 --> 00:53:29.630
rolling it out next
year and into 2020,

00:53:29.630 --> 00:53:33.260
so just making sure the
infrastructure works.

00:53:33.260 --> 00:53:35.370
And then central bank
digital currency--

00:53:35.370 --> 00:53:38.660
so we're going to do two
lectures on central bank

00:53:38.660 --> 00:53:39.680
digital currencies.

00:53:39.680 --> 00:53:42.510
And I probably should've
just skip this slide.

00:53:42.510 --> 00:53:46.280
But here are some of the
concerns around central bank

00:53:46.280 --> 00:53:47.820
digital currencies.

00:53:47.820 --> 00:53:49.880
It could be pro cyclical.

00:53:49.880 --> 00:53:51.920
A central bank
digital currency means

00:53:51.920 --> 00:53:57.180
the central bank
says Joaquin does not

00:53:57.180 --> 00:53:59.730
have to deposit at a
bank to have US dollars.

00:53:59.730 --> 00:54:03.580
He can deposit straight
with the Federal Reserve.

00:54:03.580 --> 00:54:06.010
Or in Sweden, it's
close enough to do it.

00:54:06.010 --> 00:54:09.310
You can deposit straight with
the Swedish central bank.

00:54:09.310 --> 00:54:11.450
We'll talk about this
more in a couple of weeks.

00:54:11.450 --> 00:54:15.670
But that could lead to runs
away from commercial banks

00:54:15.670 --> 00:54:16.890
to central banks.

00:54:16.890 --> 00:54:20.680
AUDIENCE: I think my key
question is, if you do so,

00:54:20.680 --> 00:54:24.280
you run the central bank
digital currency on parallel

00:54:24.280 --> 00:54:25.730
to its Fiat currency.

00:54:25.730 --> 00:54:28.120
And that would
jeopardize the ability

00:54:28.120 --> 00:54:30.550
that the central bank
would be able to carry out

00:54:30.550 --> 00:54:34.280
monetary policy, especially
if you use Bitcoin in a way

00:54:34.280 --> 00:54:39.010
that the supply is rigid, the
ability for you to actually

00:54:39.010 --> 00:54:44.580
carry out for the
likes of [INAUDIBLE]??

00:54:44.580 --> 00:54:46.630
GARY GENSLER: Remind
me your first name?

00:54:46.630 --> 00:54:47.380
Sean.

00:54:47.380 --> 00:54:49.810
So Sean, I agree with Sean.

00:54:49.810 --> 00:54:51.392
Can you hold that
for about two weeks

00:54:51.392 --> 00:54:52.600
when we're going to go deep--

00:54:52.600 --> 00:54:56.840
we're going to do a deep
dive on all of these.

00:54:56.840 --> 00:55:00.820
But basically, Sean's point
is if a central bank issues

00:55:00.820 --> 00:55:03.700
currency directly to
the public digitally,

00:55:03.700 --> 00:55:07.610
could it also undermine
monetary policy?

00:55:07.610 --> 00:55:10.840
And there's a bunch of
neat trade-offs there.

00:55:10.840 --> 00:55:12.520
I leave it for you
just to say we're

00:55:12.520 --> 00:55:14.650
going to come back to that.

00:55:14.650 --> 00:55:17.620
The investing public--
so we've talked

00:55:17.620 --> 00:55:21.710
about that the markets are
readily susceptible to fraud

00:55:21.710 --> 00:55:22.540
manipulation.

00:55:22.540 --> 00:55:24.740
And we're going to spend
a couple of lectures

00:55:24.740 --> 00:55:28.410
on crypto exchanges.

00:55:28.410 --> 00:55:33.310
But they're not regulated
for market integrity.

00:55:33.310 --> 00:55:35.800
So a simple thing like--

00:55:35.800 --> 00:55:37.095
remind me your first name.

00:55:37.095 --> 00:55:38.020
AUDIENCE: Michael.

00:55:38.020 --> 00:55:38.937
GARY GENSLER: Michael.

00:55:38.937 --> 00:55:40.420
Michael has trades.

00:55:40.420 --> 00:55:43.000
And I'm assuming some of
those are on crypto exchanges?

00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:43.770
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:55:43.770 --> 00:55:44.770
GARY GENSLER: All right.

00:55:44.770 --> 00:55:48.010
So when Michael puts an
order on a crypto exchange,

00:55:48.010 --> 00:55:51.670
there's currently no
rules in the rule books,

00:55:51.670 --> 00:55:55.270
no law in the law that
says that exchange

00:55:55.270 --> 00:55:56.980
can't front-run Michael.

00:55:56.980 --> 00:56:01.840
So Michael says he wants
to buy Bitcoin at $6,400

00:56:01.840 --> 00:56:05.620
and the crypto exchange could
buy some in front of him

00:56:05.620 --> 00:56:07.680
at $6,490--

00:56:07.680 --> 00:56:09.790
or $6,390.

00:56:09.790 --> 00:56:11.830
Yeah, sorry.

00:56:11.830 --> 00:56:13.790
That's called front running.

00:56:13.790 --> 00:56:17.260
So there are many,
many ways to make money

00:56:17.260 --> 00:56:22.440
on Michael's order that
can just be goofed around.

00:56:22.440 --> 00:56:24.630
Kyle, is that a question?

00:56:24.630 --> 00:56:28.020
AUDIENCE: I thought that
front-running [INAUDIBLE]

00:56:28.020 --> 00:56:30.480
were criminal activities
if they weren't

00:56:30.480 --> 00:56:35.740
covered in a particular
law or regulation by FINRA.

00:56:35.740 --> 00:56:37.410
Is that not correct?

00:56:37.410 --> 00:56:38.880
GARY GENSLER: So
Kyle is raising--

00:56:38.880 --> 00:56:42.780
well, maybe if it's not covered
by investor protection laws,

00:56:42.780 --> 00:56:45.120
might it be covered
by other laws?

00:56:45.120 --> 00:56:46.740
You mentioned FINRA.

00:56:46.740 --> 00:56:49.980
FINRA, which is the
self-regulatory organization

00:56:49.980 --> 00:56:53.460
in the US for investments,
would be investment law.

00:56:53.460 --> 00:56:54.910
But Kyle, you're right.

00:56:54.910 --> 00:57:00.060
Certain things are still
against consumer laws.

00:57:00.060 --> 00:57:02.490
I don't think front-running
is one of them,

00:57:02.490 --> 00:57:05.630
but you might be
right about that.

00:57:05.630 --> 00:57:07.195
I would contend--

00:57:07.195 --> 00:57:12.110
I'm an advocate that
Western societies early on

00:57:12.110 --> 00:57:14.390
and many developing
countries in Asia,

00:57:14.390 --> 00:57:18.380
elsewhere benefited by
layering investor protection

00:57:18.380 --> 00:57:20.540
over consumer protection.

00:57:20.540 --> 00:57:24.770
That consumer protection is
about transacting and the fraud

00:57:24.770 --> 00:57:27.530
that can happen in a
transaction-- selling

00:57:27.530 --> 00:57:30.080
an automobile,
selling a baby's crib,

00:57:30.080 --> 00:57:33.620
and so forth, selling
a bottle of milk.

00:57:33.620 --> 00:57:38.090
Investor protection also layers
on something else which has

00:57:38.090 --> 00:57:41.690
to do with issuers having
information asymmetries,

00:57:41.690 --> 00:57:43.760
that the issuer
knows something--

00:57:43.760 --> 00:57:45.800
the person raising money--

00:57:45.800 --> 00:57:48.690
and the purchaser does
not know that information.

00:57:48.690 --> 00:57:51.740
There's a lot of
information asymmetries

00:57:51.740 --> 00:57:55.220
that you're trying to
address in the market.

00:57:55.220 --> 00:57:58.550
And then secondly
around exchanges

00:57:58.550 --> 00:58:01.400
the concepts of
pre-trade transparency,

00:58:01.400 --> 00:58:05.420
post-trade transparency,
trying to bring transparency

00:58:05.420 --> 00:58:08.610
and saying we're going to
promote economic activity.

00:58:08.610 --> 00:58:11.600
So in the US, there were
two laws passed in 1933

00:58:11.600 --> 00:58:15.722
and '34, the Exchange Act and--

00:58:15.722 --> 00:58:17.930
sorry, I'm going to have to
remember-- the Securities

00:58:17.930 --> 00:58:18.972
Act and the Exchange Act.

00:58:18.972 --> 00:58:21.470
But one was for issuers,
which was the first one,

00:58:21.470 --> 00:58:25.490
and the second was for
exchanges in '33 and '34.

00:58:25.490 --> 00:58:28.140
And I think those
are the key things.

00:58:28.140 --> 00:58:30.050
Let me just mention--
the key question,

00:58:30.050 --> 00:58:31.850
the definition that
we will be wrestling

00:58:31.850 --> 00:58:34.070
with for the next
several weeks is

00:58:34.070 --> 00:58:37.310
when is something is security,
when is it a commodity, when

00:58:37.310 --> 00:58:39.080
is it a derivative.

00:58:39.080 --> 00:58:42.530
We don't have to answer these
today, but those will be--

00:58:42.530 --> 00:58:43.890
is it a security?

00:58:43.890 --> 00:58:45.050
Is it a commodity?

00:58:45.050 --> 00:58:47.280
Is it a derivative?

00:58:47.280 --> 00:58:51.360
Not only are there
different laws for each,

00:58:51.360 --> 00:58:53.370
but there's different
public policies

00:58:53.370 --> 00:58:57.240
and different normative
behavior that's implicated.

00:58:57.240 --> 00:59:00.540
Securities are when
there is an issuer.

00:59:00.540 --> 00:59:03.150
And fundamentally, just from
a public policy point of view,

00:59:03.150 --> 00:59:06.210
there's an
information asymmetry.

00:59:06.210 --> 00:59:09.060
That person raising money
knows more information

00:59:09.060 --> 00:59:12.750
than the person investing,
they probably always will.

00:59:12.750 --> 00:59:17.085
So you get to, what's the
fair exchange of information?

00:59:19.500 --> 00:59:21.000
I'm going to skip
a couple of things

00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:24.660
just to say why investor
protection to Kyle's question.

00:59:24.660 --> 00:59:25.560
It goes beyond.

00:59:25.560 --> 00:59:29.790
And here are what are the Gary
Gensler four bullet points.

00:59:29.790 --> 00:59:32.310
This you will not see
in a textbook somewhere.

00:59:32.310 --> 00:59:35.040
But these are the key things
I think investor protection

00:59:35.040 --> 00:59:37.490
layers on top of
consumer protection.

00:59:37.490 --> 00:59:40.710
One, investors get full
and fair disclosure.

00:59:40.710 --> 00:59:43.530
You can debate what full
and fair disclosure is,

00:59:43.530 --> 00:59:46.080
but it's something
more than I'm selling

00:59:46.080 --> 00:59:47.280
you this carton of milk.

00:59:49.960 --> 00:59:53.710
Fraud and deceptive
practices are prohibited.

00:59:53.710 --> 00:59:55.660
Now, fraud is supposedly
prohibited even

00:59:55.660 --> 00:59:57.760
when you buy a carton
of milk, but there's

00:59:57.760 --> 01:00:00.010
some added bits to it.

01:00:00.010 --> 01:00:02.770
And then this thing I said
about the secondary markets,

01:00:02.770 --> 01:00:05.330
promoting price transparency.

01:00:05.330 --> 01:00:07.300
And then lastly one that
I hadn't talked about,

01:00:07.300 --> 01:00:10.750
that the advisors usually
have a lot of conflicts

01:00:10.750 --> 01:00:12.342
in the financial markets.

01:00:12.342 --> 01:00:14.050
There's almost always,
in most countries,

01:00:14.050 --> 01:00:17.710
some additional responsibilities
around the advisors,

01:00:17.710 --> 01:00:20.350
whether it's what's called
a fiduciary responsibility

01:00:20.350 --> 01:00:22.450
or some other responsibility.

01:00:22.450 --> 01:00:25.000
Sometimes, it's
just a best efforts,

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:28.660
but there's usually some
additional responsibilities

01:00:28.660 --> 01:00:29.980
on advisors.

01:00:29.980 --> 01:00:31.930
And those four bullet points--

01:00:31.930 --> 01:00:34.810
I don't mean to teach
a whole securities law

01:00:34.810 --> 01:00:37.090
course in three minutes
or less, but those

01:00:37.090 --> 01:00:38.560
are how I quite summarize it.

01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:39.060
Tom?

01:00:39.060 --> 01:00:40.560
AUDIENCE: That first
bullet, is that

01:00:40.560 --> 01:00:43.750
from insurers or from issuers?

01:00:43.750 --> 01:00:45.490
GARY GENSLER: Issuers.

01:00:45.490 --> 01:00:46.630
Thank you.

01:00:46.630 --> 01:00:49.240
Issuers, yes.

01:00:49.240 --> 01:00:49.857
Sorry.

01:00:49.857 --> 01:00:50.357
Emily?

01:00:50.357 --> 01:00:51.857
AUDIENCE: Is there
any consideration

01:00:51.857 --> 01:00:57.340
for how to prioritize
between investor and consumer

01:00:57.340 --> 01:01:00.310
protection versus,
say, tax enforcement?

01:01:00.310 --> 01:01:04.020
In that I can imagine that if
there was increased protection,

01:01:04.020 --> 01:01:05.710
it would incentivize
more investment,

01:01:05.710 --> 01:01:09.850
which then could, without
prior tax coverage,

01:01:09.850 --> 01:01:11.310
make it so that [INAUDIBLE].

01:01:11.310 --> 01:01:13.407
GARY GENSLER: Is that
word tax or hacks?

01:01:13.407 --> 01:01:13.990
AUDIENCE: Tax.

01:01:13.990 --> 01:01:14.823
GARY GENSLER: T-A-X.

01:01:14.823 --> 01:01:15.958
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:01:15.958 --> 01:01:18.250
So I would imagine that more
protection would encourage

01:01:18.250 --> 01:01:20.560
more investment, but then
more people potentially

01:01:20.560 --> 01:01:24.100
would be evading taxes
if there wasn't already

01:01:24.100 --> 01:01:27.620
that tax framework in place.

01:01:27.620 --> 01:01:30.690
GARY GENSLER: So Emily
raises the question,

01:01:30.690 --> 01:01:32.550
how does any
society, in a sense,

01:01:32.550 --> 01:01:37.500
make some trade-offs between
tax and investor protection

01:01:37.500 --> 01:01:40.080
regimes?

01:01:40.080 --> 01:01:42.840
And ultimately, if I can
take it one step back,

01:01:42.840 --> 01:01:44.800
that's what some
countries are doing now,

01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:47.370
but they've been doing it
for a couple of centuries.

01:01:47.370 --> 01:01:49.260
How do you promote
innovation that might

01:01:49.260 --> 01:01:51.140
promote economic activity?

01:01:51.140 --> 01:01:53.730
So I'm broadening your question.

01:01:53.730 --> 01:01:56.500
How do you promote
economic activity

01:01:56.500 --> 01:01:59.820
while in the midst still
promoting whatever social goods

01:01:59.820 --> 01:02:04.260
you're trying to achieve in
some regulatory framework?

01:02:04.260 --> 01:02:06.360
Investor protection,
so I made it

01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:10.290
the broadest, because that's
what you'll hear often

01:02:10.290 --> 01:02:11.690
around blockchain and Bitcoin.

01:02:11.690 --> 01:02:13.920
But it was true when the
railroads came along.

01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:17.370
It was true more recently
when the internet came along,

01:02:17.370 --> 01:02:19.170
how to promote
this new technology

01:02:19.170 --> 01:02:23.100
of the internet while actually
still promoting broadly

01:02:23.100 --> 01:02:26.420
the social goods that
we're trying to achieve.

01:02:26.420 --> 01:02:30.110
I'm one in the camp
that says protecting

01:02:30.110 --> 01:02:32.870
against illicit activity,
financial stability

01:02:32.870 --> 01:02:37.640
of investor protection
do, in and of themselves,

01:02:37.640 --> 01:02:41.060
promote society and
economic well-being.

01:02:41.060 --> 01:02:43.910
I don't think-- this
is Gary Gensler.

01:02:43.910 --> 01:02:46.610
I don't think they're
necessarily in conflict.

01:02:46.610 --> 01:02:49.430
There are others who
say no, no, no, no, you

01:02:49.430 --> 01:02:52.850
can't promote economic
activity or taxes

01:02:52.850 --> 01:02:57.040
and also promote
investor protection.

01:02:57.040 --> 01:02:59.150
I believe that's
more short sighted.

01:02:59.150 --> 01:03:02.650
I think the regimes and reforms
of the 1930s in this country

01:03:02.650 --> 01:03:04.150
and other decades
in other countries

01:03:04.150 --> 01:03:08.590
are part of why we have had
such a prosperous last 70 or 80

01:03:08.590 --> 01:03:09.850
years.

01:03:09.850 --> 01:03:11.500
That investor
protection actually

01:03:11.500 --> 01:03:15.910
lowers the risk to issuers.

01:03:15.910 --> 01:03:18.670
Thank you for
correcting, issuers.

01:03:18.670 --> 01:03:22.810
It lowers the risk of issuers
and lowers the cost of capital.

01:03:22.810 --> 01:03:25.850
If you have good
investor protection,

01:03:25.850 --> 01:03:32.220
I believe ultimately it
lowers the cost of capital,

01:03:32.220 --> 01:03:34.640
which is what I said and
those two bullet points.

01:03:34.640 --> 01:03:36.650
So US securities
law, did anybody

01:03:36.650 --> 01:03:38.510
want to tell me what
the Howey test was?

01:03:41.100 --> 01:03:44.610
What are those
arches right there?

01:03:44.610 --> 01:03:47.120
Well, we'll take somebody new.

01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:49.304
First name?

01:03:49.304 --> 01:03:51.200
AUDIENCE: Actually,
the Howey Test

01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:57.810
is coming from a Supreme
Court case which was in 1946.

01:03:57.810 --> 01:04:00.860
And at that time,
the Supreme Court

01:04:00.860 --> 01:04:04.520
was about to make a decision
on, as far as I remember,

01:04:04.520 --> 01:04:06.640
citrus groves.

01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:11.090
And at the end of the day,
they decided that citrus groves

01:04:11.090 --> 01:04:12.800
are securities.

01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:17.800
And right after that,
there's a kind of agreement

01:04:17.800 --> 01:04:21.140
to be able to define
something as a security.

01:04:21.140 --> 01:04:23.790
It has to meet four criteria.

01:04:23.790 --> 01:04:25.290
GARY GENSLER: Let's
pause you there.

01:04:25.290 --> 01:04:25.940
All right.

01:04:25.940 --> 01:04:28.730
So citrus groves
in Florida somehow

01:04:28.730 --> 01:04:30.410
are securities,
absolutely right.

01:04:30.410 --> 01:04:33.890
A man named William Howey,
he ran for governor actually

01:04:33.890 --> 01:04:35.610
in Florida a couple
of times and lost,

01:04:35.610 --> 01:04:39.140
but he had a real estate
venture and he had those arches

01:04:39.140 --> 01:04:41.360
by his real estate venture.

01:04:41.360 --> 01:04:44.600
And he figured he could
sell part of his land

01:04:44.600 --> 01:04:46.310
as citrus groves.

01:04:46.310 --> 01:04:49.370
So the question was, when he
was selling that land could that

01:04:49.370 --> 01:04:53.510
be, actually technically
an investment contract?

01:04:53.510 --> 01:04:57.140
Because in 1933, the
Congress of the United States

01:04:57.140 --> 01:04:59.660
included in the
definition of security

01:04:59.660 --> 01:05:03.730
these two words,
investment contract.

01:05:03.730 --> 01:05:06.850
It said equity, stock, options.

01:05:06.850 --> 01:05:08.750
It kept having a
bunch of commas.

01:05:08.750 --> 01:05:11.630
There was a comma,
investment contract, comma,

01:05:11.630 --> 01:05:12.830
and it kept going.

01:05:12.830 --> 01:05:15.230
So the real legal question
that went to the Supreme Court

01:05:15.230 --> 01:05:20.540
was not whether Bill Howey's
citrus groves were securities.

01:05:20.540 --> 01:05:24.920
It was whether Bill Howey's
citrus groves were investment

01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:26.930
contracts, because
Congress had already

01:05:26.930 --> 01:05:30.890
decided by putting the two
words and a couple of columns

01:05:30.890 --> 01:05:32.330
that it was a security.

01:05:32.330 --> 01:05:34.760
And that separates us
from the European Union

01:05:34.760 --> 01:05:37.820
and many other jurisdictions,
because Congress

01:05:37.820 --> 01:05:41.240
put those two words in there,
investment contracts, which

01:05:41.240 --> 01:05:43.250
had to do with a lot
of scams and frauds

01:05:43.250 --> 01:05:47.530
from the 1890s to the 1920s.

01:05:47.530 --> 01:05:51.730
And to meet the
investment contract test

01:05:51.730 --> 01:05:53.560
is this for part test.

01:05:53.560 --> 01:05:56.980
Is it an investment
of money or assets?

01:05:56.980 --> 01:06:02.030
Basically, the SEC has said
that if you're giving Ether--

01:06:02.030 --> 01:06:04.190
or you're giving
Bitcoin to buy Ether,

01:06:04.190 --> 01:06:11.330
you're giving Bitcoin to buy
some Amanda token, all right?

01:06:11.330 --> 01:06:13.580
That's an investment
of money or assets.

01:06:13.580 --> 01:06:14.900
That's what the SEC has said.

01:06:14.900 --> 01:06:17.810
And most lawyers kind
of agree with that.

01:06:17.810 --> 01:06:20.810
Is it an investment in
a common enterprise?

01:06:20.810 --> 01:06:25.840
So is there a group
of developers that--

01:06:25.840 --> 01:06:28.230
or is this like a
common enterprise?

01:06:28.230 --> 01:06:29.610
Some people debate that.

01:06:29.610 --> 01:06:31.650
Some people say, well,
we weren't-- really,

01:06:31.650 --> 01:06:32.640
it's an open source.

01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:34.320
If you're an open
source software,

01:06:34.320 --> 01:06:36.030
that's not going to
be enough to get away

01:06:36.030 --> 01:06:39.070
from being a common enterprise.

01:06:39.070 --> 01:06:41.830
Is there a reasonable
expectation of profits?

01:06:41.830 --> 01:06:45.050
Most people think of profits
coming from dividends

01:06:45.050 --> 01:06:49.540
or interest on your bond.

01:06:49.540 --> 01:06:52.840
The SEC has said, and
there's relevant court cases

01:06:52.840 --> 01:06:55.780
that say profits could
be just the expectation

01:06:55.780 --> 01:06:58.400
of the appreciation
of the asset.

01:06:58.400 --> 01:07:01.630
So I buy a token
today for six Ether

01:07:01.630 --> 01:07:05.180
and tomorrow I think it
might be worth 10 Eth.

01:07:05.180 --> 01:07:09.470
That's a reasonable
expectation of profits.

01:07:09.470 --> 01:07:13.630
And the efforts of
others, is it reliant

01:07:13.630 --> 01:07:14.630
on the efforts of other?

01:07:14.630 --> 01:07:17.160
This four part test.

01:07:17.160 --> 01:07:20.300
Jay Clayton, the head of the
SEC said earlier this year,

01:07:20.300 --> 01:07:22.730
in essence, he hadn't
met an ICO that he

01:07:22.730 --> 01:07:24.650
didn't think was a security.

01:07:24.650 --> 01:07:26.780
His words were a little
bit cleaner than that,

01:07:26.780 --> 01:07:30.710
but it was basically saying this
initial coin offering market is

01:07:30.710 --> 01:07:32.330
probably mostly securities.

01:07:32.330 --> 01:07:34.520
Again, it's probably
less than a quarter

01:07:34.520 --> 01:07:36.540
of the whole crypto
finance market.

01:07:36.540 --> 01:07:39.020
It's a very relevant
issue if any of you

01:07:39.020 --> 01:07:41.540
are trying to do a startup.

01:07:41.540 --> 01:07:46.070
But I would contend it's not
the largest public policy issue.

01:07:46.070 --> 01:07:50.280
But borders and boundaries
make a difference.

01:07:50.280 --> 01:07:55.700
The Duck Test, this is
basically how I think about it.

01:07:55.700 --> 01:07:59.280
Christopher, you
want to say it again?

01:07:59.280 --> 01:08:01.790
AUDIENCE: If you see a bird
that walks like a duck,

01:08:01.790 --> 01:08:04.340
swims like a duck, and
quacks like a duck,

01:08:04.340 --> 01:08:07.304
I think that's a damn duck.

01:08:07.304 --> 01:08:10.730
GARY GENSLER: So if you have
a public policy question,

01:08:10.730 --> 01:08:14.150
like, do I have to file
under the Bank Secrecy Act?

01:08:14.150 --> 01:08:16.279
Do I have to be a security?

01:08:16.279 --> 01:08:17.990
Do I have to be that?

01:08:17.990 --> 01:08:22.700
And before you pay that law
firm $1,000 or $1,500 an hour--

01:08:22.700 --> 01:08:26.450
and there are many lawyers
that, I guess, are worth that--

01:08:26.450 --> 01:08:29.359
ask yourself this question.

01:08:29.359 --> 01:08:33.569
And I'm trying to impart a value
judgment to all of you, too,

01:08:33.569 --> 01:08:36.109
not only to save you
legal fees, but there

01:08:36.109 --> 01:08:38.390
are many lawyers who
are going to try to help

01:08:38.390 --> 01:08:40.412
you solve your problems.

01:08:40.412 --> 01:08:41.870
But when you feel
like they're just

01:08:41.870 --> 01:08:44.660
trying to get between the
wallpaper and the wall

01:08:44.660 --> 01:08:47.420
with the narrowness and
the thinness of the slice

01:08:47.420 --> 01:08:50.630
of their legal judgment,
remember how Christopher

01:08:50.630 --> 01:08:53.390
just gave us the Duck Test.

01:08:53.390 --> 01:08:55.370
And then step away and
say, well, maybe there's

01:08:55.370 --> 01:08:59.069
another business solution
to what you're trying to do,

01:08:59.069 --> 01:09:01.250
because if it
doesn't pass the Duck

01:09:01.250 --> 01:09:04.310
Test at some point in
time, you're probably

01:09:04.310 --> 01:09:09.109
going to have your
friends from the IRS,

01:09:09.109 --> 01:09:11.359
or your friends from
the Justice Department,

01:09:11.359 --> 01:09:15.200
or the friends from the
SEC knocking on your door.

01:09:15.200 --> 01:09:16.760
And those are the
friends you usually

01:09:16.760 --> 01:09:20.840
don't want to have
knocking on your door.

01:09:20.840 --> 01:09:24.529
There's still 200
to 300 ICOs a month.

01:09:24.529 --> 01:09:28.870
I just wanted to say that
the market has not gone away.

01:09:28.870 --> 01:09:30.819
And the Initial Coin
Offering Market,

01:09:30.819 --> 01:09:33.399
which we're going to talk
about in a couple weeks,

01:09:33.399 --> 01:09:36.830
has all these attributes
of the Howey Test.

01:09:36.830 --> 01:09:39.729
They're raising proceeds
and they're usually

01:09:39.729 --> 01:09:41.050
trying to be functional.

01:09:41.050 --> 01:09:43.149
I want to skip ahead a
little bit to something

01:09:43.149 --> 01:09:45.149
on public policy.

01:09:45.149 --> 01:09:46.779
And we're going to
do crypto exchanges,

01:09:46.779 --> 01:09:49.000
so I apologize I'm
running tight on time.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:55.030
But I want to do something
that Lauren and Tom have seen.

01:09:55.030 --> 01:09:56.260
Well, let me pause here.

01:09:56.260 --> 01:09:57.970
This is regulatory arbitrage.

01:09:57.970 --> 01:10:00.160
And Kelly, given your
paper, you'll like this.

01:10:00.160 --> 01:10:03.535
But this is the list of where
cryptocurrency exchanges were.

01:10:03.535 --> 01:10:05.350
It's from a Morgan
Stanley research

01:10:05.350 --> 01:10:07.390
paper earlier this year.

01:10:07.390 --> 01:10:09.610
But if you can see the
little slices on the left,

01:10:09.610 --> 01:10:14.050
that's Malta, Belize,
and Seychelles,

01:10:14.050 --> 01:10:16.870
three really deep
capital markets.

01:10:16.870 --> 01:10:19.300
Well, not really, not really.

01:10:19.300 --> 01:10:24.770
But a bunch of exchanges from
South Korea, Hong Kong and Asia

01:10:24.770 --> 01:10:31.090
reincorporated in Malta,
the Seychelles, and Belize.

01:10:31.090 --> 01:10:33.040
And so it's just
there is a whole bunch

01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:36.880
of regulatory arbitrage
going on right now.

01:10:36.880 --> 01:10:40.450
Public policy development--
this is only five minutes,

01:10:40.450 --> 01:10:43.720
but I just wanted to mention
how public policy actually

01:10:43.720 --> 01:10:45.810
comes together.

01:10:45.810 --> 01:10:49.960
And Tom, you going
to help me here?

01:10:49.960 --> 01:10:51.730
You got it?

01:10:51.730 --> 01:10:52.782
AUDIENCE: Analysis.

01:10:52.782 --> 01:10:53.740
GARY GENSLER: Analysis.

01:10:53.740 --> 01:10:55.120
Tom starts with analysis.

01:10:55.120 --> 01:10:57.670
Who thinks analysis
is at the top of what

01:10:57.670 --> 01:10:59.810
happens in public policy?

01:10:59.810 --> 01:11:02.130
Any show of hands?

01:11:02.130 --> 01:11:03.600
Tom, no.

01:11:03.600 --> 01:11:04.560
What's number one?

01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:06.850
What do you think happens first?

01:11:06.850 --> 01:11:07.350
What's that?

01:11:07.350 --> 01:11:08.310
AUDIENCE: Panic.

01:11:08.310 --> 01:11:10.980
GARY GENSLER: Panic.

01:11:10.980 --> 01:11:12.180
Public policy, huh?

01:11:12.180 --> 01:11:14.460
Panic?

01:11:14.460 --> 01:11:15.400
Lauren?

01:11:15.400 --> 01:11:16.817
AUDIENCE: I thought
this was going

01:11:16.817 --> 01:11:18.660
to be a plug for your
personnel as policy.

01:11:18.660 --> 01:11:21.060
GARY GENSLER: Personnel as
policy is going to be in here,

01:11:21.060 --> 01:11:24.560
but messaging.

01:11:24.560 --> 01:11:27.130
If you don't get
your message right,

01:11:27.130 --> 01:11:31.110
you're never going to
get to your analysis.

01:11:31.110 --> 01:11:35.006
But there's one other thing
between messaging and analysis.

01:11:35.006 --> 01:11:36.320
AUDIENCE: Coalition.

01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:38.510
GARY GENSLER: Coalition
building or politics.

01:11:38.510 --> 01:11:40.790
So messaging-- with
your messaging,

01:11:40.790 --> 01:11:43.880
you can build a coalition,
which is called politics.

01:11:43.880 --> 01:11:45.860
And if you get your
politics right,

01:11:45.860 --> 01:11:49.400
you can actually get
to your analysis.

01:11:49.400 --> 01:11:52.730
This hierarchy, not
written in textbooks,

01:11:52.730 --> 01:11:58.340
comes from an old, wonderful
political lawyer from Texas

01:11:58.340 --> 01:12:00.057
who shared it with
me some 20 years ago

01:12:00.057 --> 01:12:01.140
when I went to Washington.

01:12:01.140 --> 01:12:06.560
He said, young man, you know
nothing about this town.

01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:08.060
You don't get your
message right,

01:12:08.060 --> 01:12:09.620
you're not going to
get to your politics.

01:12:09.620 --> 01:12:11.162
If you don't get
your politics right,

01:12:11.162 --> 01:12:14.150
you'll never get to your
analysis and your policy.

01:12:14.150 --> 01:12:18.130
And that's how it's
all made, kind of.

01:12:18.130 --> 01:12:19.980
And so what do I
mean by messaging?

01:12:19.980 --> 01:12:21.920
So let's have a
little bit of fun.

01:12:21.920 --> 01:12:24.370
Does anybody remember this?

01:12:24.370 --> 01:12:25.990
What's that?

01:12:25.990 --> 01:12:27.250
What is that?

01:12:27.250 --> 01:12:28.610
Messaging, right?

01:12:28.610 --> 01:12:31.880
It's messaging from 2016.

01:12:31.880 --> 01:12:33.740
Does anybody want
to go back to 2008

01:12:33.740 --> 01:12:37.460
and tell me what was the message
for 2008 to have some fun?

01:12:37.460 --> 01:12:39.020
AUDIENCE: Hope and change.

01:12:39.020 --> 01:12:39.895
GARY GENSLER: Change.

01:12:42.200 --> 01:12:44.780
AUDIENCE: Change we believe in.

01:12:44.780 --> 01:12:48.710
GARY GENSLER: You want
to go back to 2000?

01:12:48.710 --> 01:12:49.850
Harder, harder I know.

01:12:49.850 --> 01:12:52.910
It's almost-- it's not
in the history books yet.

01:12:52.910 --> 01:12:54.440
No?

01:12:54.440 --> 01:12:57.650
Compassionate conservative.

01:12:57.650 --> 01:13:00.150
That's W. He was
compassionate, he

01:13:00.150 --> 01:13:02.060
was conservative,
but compassionate,

01:13:02.060 --> 01:13:05.860
a nod to that moderate side.

01:13:05.860 --> 01:13:06.860
'92?

01:13:06.860 --> 01:13:11.530
This is going to be hard, huh?

01:13:11.530 --> 01:13:12.930
It's the economy, stupid.

01:13:15.387 --> 01:13:16.720
That's Bill Clinton, by the way.

01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:21.130
It's the economy, stupid.

01:13:21.130 --> 01:13:22.780
So messaging.

01:13:22.780 --> 01:13:24.910
Coalition building,
that just basically

01:13:24.910 --> 01:13:27.500
means, unless you can
really bring folks together.

01:13:27.500 --> 01:13:30.190
So in the blockchain
Bitcoin space,

01:13:30.190 --> 01:13:34.080
right now, there's
not a broad coalition.

01:13:34.080 --> 01:13:36.900
It's not a deep well of
people investing in blockchain

01:13:36.900 --> 01:13:38.770
and Bitcoin in America.

01:13:38.770 --> 01:13:41.610
But if you were to try
to address yourselves

01:13:41.610 --> 01:13:45.210
to legislative change
or regulatory change,

01:13:45.210 --> 01:13:47.610
you'd need some coalition.

01:13:47.610 --> 01:13:51.180
You probably can't just
be a bunch of miners,

01:13:51.180 --> 01:13:56.070
or a bunch of incumbents, or
startups, or crypto exchanges.

01:13:56.070 --> 01:13:59.220
There would have to be some
form of coalition building

01:13:59.220 --> 01:14:02.710
that goes along with it.

01:14:02.710 --> 01:14:04.690
Analysis does matter.

01:14:04.690 --> 01:14:06.940
I'm not going to say,
Tom, it doesn't matter.

01:14:06.940 --> 01:14:13.160
It's just-- no, no, it's
just to get to the analysis--

01:14:13.160 --> 01:14:16.210
if you are sitting down with
somebody in Congress right now,

01:14:16.210 --> 01:14:21.640
you probably also need,
as James says, the crisis.

01:14:21.640 --> 01:14:24.310
My sense is legislative
bodies around the globe,

01:14:24.310 --> 01:14:27.070
by and large, are not engaged
in blockchain Bitcoin yet.

01:14:27.070 --> 01:14:29.030
Gibraltar passed something.

01:14:29.030 --> 01:14:30.370
Malta's passed something.

01:14:30.370 --> 01:14:34.890
The Russian Duma,
thank you, has been

01:14:34.890 --> 01:14:36.990
working on something
for six straight months

01:14:36.990 --> 01:14:39.240
and can't come to a
coalition around it.

01:14:39.240 --> 01:14:41.310
Some state legislative
bodies in the US

01:14:41.310 --> 01:14:43.530
have passed some modest things.

01:14:43.530 --> 01:14:45.840
There was a bill in
Arizona actually promoted

01:14:45.840 --> 01:14:49.950
to allow Bitcoin for
payment of taxes.

01:14:49.950 --> 01:14:52.620
It failed in committee,
but it's interesting.

01:14:52.620 --> 01:14:53.590
Question?

01:14:53.590 --> 01:14:55.920
No.

01:14:55.920 --> 01:14:57.750
And yes, Lauren, you're right.

01:14:57.750 --> 01:14:59.460
Personnel is policy.

01:14:59.460 --> 01:15:03.960
Ultimately, who sits
in the jobs matters.

01:15:03.960 --> 01:15:05.400
And I would just close on it.

01:15:05.400 --> 01:15:07.650
Think of those several layers.

01:15:07.650 --> 01:15:09.930
There's the political layer.

01:15:09.930 --> 01:15:12.210
Those are either
elected or appointed

01:15:12.210 --> 01:15:13.650
by the people that are elected.

01:15:13.650 --> 01:15:15.540
There's the political layer.

01:15:15.540 --> 01:15:17.910
And their risk
appetites are different

01:15:17.910 --> 01:15:25.490
than the senior career level
and the day-to-day career level.

01:15:25.490 --> 01:15:27.860
And the day-to-day
career level is usually

01:15:27.860 --> 01:15:31.220
that person with whom
we are all interfacing.

01:15:31.220 --> 01:15:33.950
But as we all know, if you walk
into the Department of Motor

01:15:33.950 --> 01:15:36.320
Vehicles, that
day-to-day person,

01:15:36.320 --> 01:15:40.220
that bureaucrat really
has a very narrow range

01:15:40.220 --> 01:15:42.790
of decision making.

01:15:42.790 --> 01:15:47.550
The senior career person
who's in their 40s or 50s has

01:15:47.550 --> 01:15:53.730
a broader range of
decision making, but also

01:15:53.730 --> 01:15:58.830
always remember they live in
a world of asymmetric risk.

01:15:58.830 --> 01:16:01.830
There's not much
upside to saying yes

01:16:01.830 --> 01:16:06.180
to something new, and funky,
and hard, and difficult,

01:16:06.180 --> 01:16:09.450
but they could be getting
a host of downside risk

01:16:09.450 --> 01:16:11.820
if it blows up on their watch.

01:16:11.820 --> 01:16:14.010
So there's asymmetric risk.

01:16:14.010 --> 01:16:17.580
And Bitcoin and
blockchain gives that.

01:16:17.580 --> 01:16:20.220
So that's everything.

01:16:20.220 --> 01:16:24.180
Thursday is permissioned
versus permissionless systems.

01:16:24.180 --> 01:16:26.310
So we'll dive into some of that.

01:16:26.310 --> 01:16:30.570
If you've got more questions
on public policy, just ask.

01:16:30.570 --> 01:16:33.240
We'll be talking about
the rest of the semester.

01:16:33.240 --> 01:16:37.770
And the conclusions, basically,
are public policy matters.

01:16:37.770 --> 01:16:38.910
Thank you.

01:16:38.910 --> 01:16:43.160

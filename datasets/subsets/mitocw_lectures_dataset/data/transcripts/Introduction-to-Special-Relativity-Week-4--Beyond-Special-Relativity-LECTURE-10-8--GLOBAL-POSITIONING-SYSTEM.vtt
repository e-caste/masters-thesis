00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:15.350
PROFESSOR: Welcome back
to A20 special relativity.

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:18.680
In this last section
of this chapter,

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.400
we talked about applications
and implications

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.810
of special relativity.

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.930
We talked about the
global positioning system.

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.920
You all have used GPS
before, be it in your car

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.430
when you're trying to
find your way through town

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.760
or when you go for a run and
you want to measure how long

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.260
and how fast you
actually are running.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.960
The global positioning
system is a set

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.320
of satellites all equipped
with atomic clocks.

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.280
And they're used for navigation
and have been developed first

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.920
under the name of Napster GPS.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:59.180
And GPS is one of many global
or few global navigation system.

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:06.460
Others are GLONASS, BDS, Galileo
Systems developed in Europe,

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.920
in Russia, in Japan, and so.

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.530
This picture here
shows you how you

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.910
want to view this view of
Earth and then at around 20,000

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:21.380
kilometer, GPS has
about 31 satellites,

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.930
which zooms around the Earth.

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.750
And as soon as you have
three satellites, which

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.910
you can see from
your viewpoint, you

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:33.590
can actually figure out
where that viewpoint is.

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.940
Think about each satellite gives
you an information of a sphere.

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.370
The cross section between
two spheres is a line.

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:44.900
And if you have three
spheres crossing,

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:49.280
that gives you three-dimensional
information about location

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.060
on which you're looking at this.

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.560
GPS was-- the first satellites
were launched in 1978.

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:02.960
Again, 31 satellites in
orbit at the time right now.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.790
So how does this work?

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:06.790
So the satellite
transmits information

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.530
about position in time
in regular intervals.

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:10.880
It's does have a clock.

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.770
They use a specific frequency
or multiple frequency

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.870
to send signals.

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.490
And then the receiver calculates
how far away the satellite is

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:24.430
and how long it took
the message to arrive

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.440
at the place of the receiver.

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.870
Again, three satellites are used
to extract the exact location.

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.940
However, as you can
imagine, the reason

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.530
why I bring this
up in this class

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.660
is that we have to
consider effects

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.650
of special relativity and
also, general relativity,

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.960
as we will discuss
later in this class.

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:48.490
So you have clocks
on the satellites.

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:50.680
And you have identical
clocks on Earth.

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.410
And they do tick differently
as we discussed many times

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:54.910
in this class.

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.270
If you were to calculate the
effect of special relativity,

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:00.130
the prediction is
that the clocks

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:05.880
take about 7 microseconds a
day slower on the satellite

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.450
then compared to
the one on Earth.

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.260
However, the satellite
at a higher orbit.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.590
And the gravitational
pull at a higher orbit

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.200
is less strong as on Earth.

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.770
And that then, as a
result, is the clocks

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:26.120
on the satellites actually run
faster than the ones on Earth.

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.700
And that effect is
larger, very larger

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.100
than the effect of
special relativity, which

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:35.540
is effect from then just moving
relative to the observer.

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.850
The fact is 47
microseconds a day.

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:41.000
And then you can just
calculate the net correction,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.870
which is 38 microseconds
a day, which corresponds

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.120
to about 11 kilometers.

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.940
Now imagine on your
run and there's

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.880
11 kilometer difference a day.

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:54.770
I don't expect you
to run for a day,

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:56.420
but you might run for an hour.

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:58.610
Still the effect
is rather large.

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:01.040
So you want to have a
more precise system.

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.400
And therefore, those effects
need to be corrected,

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:05.240
and they are.

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.760
They're typically built
in into the electronics

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.920
and automatically corrected.

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:13.190
The precision achieved
with GPS system

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.700
ranges a little bit based on how
you use the information, what

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:18.200
kind of transceiver you use.

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.800
It's in the order of 505
meters to 30 centimeters,

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:24.360
so about this of a distance.

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.040
So anywhere on this planet
you can pinpoint your location

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.760
by about this with
this precision.

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.180
Well, this concludes
the discussion

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:42.660
of implications and applications
in special relativity.

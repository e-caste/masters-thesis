WEBVTT

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Good morning, class.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I just wanted to spend the first
couple minutes clearing up three

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
issues. None is a major conceptual
issue, but we like to focus on

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
details and get them right,
get them correct here as well.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Firstly, I misdrew a reaction
last time that described why RNA is

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
alkali labile, i.e., if
we have high pH we call

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
that an alkali pH, or
an alkaline pH, actually,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
to use the adjective. And we
said that hydroxyl groups can

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
cause the cleavage of the
phosphodiester bonds of RNA but not

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
DNA. And the way I described that
happening is that the alkali group

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
causes the formation of this
five-membered ring right here,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
two carbons, two oxygens and
a phosphate. And that resolves

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
eventually to this where there's
no longer any connection with the

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
ribonucleoside monophosphate
below. And I drew it like this,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
without an oxygen, and
that's a no-no because,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
in fact, in truth, and
as many of you picked up,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
this reverts to a two prime hydroxyl.
So, please note there's a mistake

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
there. There's also a couple
other mistakes. For example,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
in the textbook it gives you the
impression that when you polymerize

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
nucleic acids you use a
monophosphate to do so.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
And, if you listened to my lecture
last time, that doesn't make any

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
sense, because you need to invest
the energy of a triphosphate in

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
order to create enough energy
to generate enough energy for the

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
polymerization. The
textbook is incorrect there.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Textbooks are written by
people, for better or worse,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
and as such, like everything else,
they are a mortal and fallible. So,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
the truth of the matter is, when
you're polymerizing DNA or RNA you

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
need one of the four ribonucleoside
or deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
in order to donate the energy that
makes possible this polymerization.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
And please note that is a
mistake in the book. Recall,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
as I said last time, the
fact that ATP is really the

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
currency of energy in the cell,
and that its energy is stored and

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
coiled up in this pent up spring
where the mutual electrostatic

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
repulsion between the three
negatively charged phosphates

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
carries with it enormous
potential energy.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
And some of that potential
energy can be realized,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
during the synthesis of
polymerization of nucleic acids by

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
cleaving this bond here. One
can also generate potential

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
energy by cleaving this bond here.
This is the alpha, the beta and the

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
gamma-phosphate. And
cleavage of either can create

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
substantial energy, which in
turn can, as we'll indicate

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
shortly, be invested in
other reactions. The reaction

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
of polymerization. A second
point I'd like to make to

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
you is the following,
and you'd say it's kind of

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
coincidence. The currency
of energy in the cell is ATP,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
adenosine triphosphate,
we see its structure here,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
and this happens to be one of
the four precursors of the RNA.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
So, the same molecule is used in
these two different ostensively

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
unrelated applications. One,
to polymerize to make RNA

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
where genetic information
is stored and conveyed.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Or, alternatively it's used here in
this context in order to serve as a

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
currency for energy. High
energy as ATP. ADP with a

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000
little lower energy. AMP
monophosphate with even lower

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000
energy. And you might ask yourself,
scratch your head and say why is the

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
same molecule used for
these two different things?

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
In fact, there are yet
other applications of these

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
ribonucleosides which also seem to
be unrelated to the storage or the

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
conveyance of genetic
information. And it is believed,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000
probably correctly, that the reason
why the same molecule is used for

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
these totally different applications
is that early in the evolution of

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
life on this planet there really
were a rather small number of

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000
biological molecules that existed.
Indeed, as we'll mention again

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
later, it's probably the case that
the first organisms didn't use DNA

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
as genomes. It's an article of
faith with us that one stores

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000
genetic information
in DNA molecules.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
And I implied that quite
explicitly last time. But,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
the fact of the matter is,
it's probably the case that the

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000
first organism, the first
pre-cellular life forms

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
used RNA as the genetic material,
RNA to store things, replicating RNA

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000
via double-stranded RNA molecules
as a way of archiving genetic

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
information. And only later during
the evolution of life on this planet,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000
when that later was we can't tell,
but it could have been a hundred or

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000
two hundred years later.
Obviously, if we're talking about

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
the origin of life as between 3.
and 3.5 billion years ago, we can't

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.000
really localize that in time
very well, but only later was DNA

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000
assigned the job of storing,
in a stable fashion, genetic

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.000
information. And as a consequence,
we come to realize as well yet

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.000
another discovery, which is
that all the catalysts that

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000
we're going to talk about today,
the enzymes as we call them, almost

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.000
all modern-day enzymes are proteins.
And we talked about them briefly

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000
before. But over the last 15 years,
20 years there's been the discovery

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000
that certain RNA molecules also
posses the ability to catalyze

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000
certain kinds of reactions.
When I was taking biochemistry,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000
if somebody would have told me that,
I would have called the psychiatric

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000
ward because that was
such an outlandish idea.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.000
How can an RNA molecule
catalyze a biochemical reaction?

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000
It doesn't have all the side
groups that one needs to create the

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000
catalytic sites for reactions.
But we now realize, on the basis of

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000
research which actually led to a
Nobel Prize being awarded about five

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000
years ago, that RNA molecules are
able to catalyze certain kinds of

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000
reactions. And that begins to
give us an insight into how life

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000
originated on this planet because
RNA molecules may have stored

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000
genetic information, as I
said before, RNA molecules,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000
or their precursors like ATP, may
have been their currency for storing

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000
high energy bonds,
as is indicated here.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000
And RNA molecules may well have been
the first enzymes to catalyze many

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.000
of the reactions in the most
primitive life forms that first

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.000
existed on this planet. And,
therefore, what I'm saying is

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:52.000
that as life developed in the first
hundred or two hundred million years,

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000
who knows how long it took,
gradually DNA took over the job of

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:01.000
storing information from RNA and
gradually proteins took over the job

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000
of mediating catalysis, of
acting as enzymes to taking over

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.000
the job from RNA molecules.
Today there are certain vestigial

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000
biochemical reactions
which we believe are relics,

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000
echoes of the beginning of life on
earth, which are still mediated by

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.000
RNA catalysts. We think
that they are throwbacks

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000
to these very early steps, maybe
even in pre-cellular life form

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:31.000
where RNA was delegated with
the task of acting as a catalyst.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000
We're going to focus a lot today
on the whole issue of biochemical

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.000
reactions and the issue of
energy. And this gets us into the

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.000
realization that there really are
two kinds of biochemical reactions.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.000
Some of you may have
learned this a long time ago.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:54.000
Either exergonic reactions
that release energy,

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.000
that produce energy as they proceed,
or conversely endergonic reactions

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:04.000
which require an investment of
energy in order to move forward.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000
So, here, obviously, if this
is a high energy state and

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000
we're talking about the
free energy of the system,

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000
which is one way to depict in
thermodynamic language how much

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000
energy is in a molecule, if we
go from a high energy state to

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000
a low energy state then we can draw
this like this and we can realize

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000
that in order to conserve energy,
the energy that was inherent in this

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000
molecule, the high potential energy
is released as this ball or this

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:37.000
molecule rolls down the
hill. And, therefore,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.000
the reaction yields energy,
it's exergonic. And, conversely,

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.000
if we want this reaction to proceed,
we need to invest free energy in

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000
order to make it happen. The
free energy happens to be,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000
more often than not, in
the form of chemical bonds,

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000
i.e., energy that can be invested,
for example, by taking advantage of

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000
the potential energy stored
in these phosphodiester,

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:06.000
in these phosphate-phosphate
linkages indicated right here.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000
Here, by the way, is the
space-filling model of ATP

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000
just for your information.
That's the way it actually would

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000
look in life, and this is
the way we actually draw it.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000
Now, having said that, if
we look at the free energy

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000
profile of various biochemical
changes then we can depict them,

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000
once again, in this
very schematic way here.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.000
And, by the way, free
energy is called G,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:40.000
the Gibbs free energy after Josiah
Gibbs who was a thermodynamic wiz in

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.000
the 19th century at Yale in New
Haven. And here what we see is that

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:50.000
the change in free energy between
the reactants and the products is

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:55.000
given by delta G.
So, by definition,

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.000
we start out the
reaction with reactants.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
And we end up at the end of
the reaction with products.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.000
And, overall, if the reaction is
exergonic and will proceed forward,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000
it releases energy. And the net
release of energy is indicated here

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.000
by delta G. But,
more often than not,

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
biochemical reactions that
are energetically favored,

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.000
that are exergonic actually
can't happen spontaneously.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.000
They don't happen spontaneously
because, for various reasons,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000
they have to pass through
an intermediate state.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000
Which actually represents a much
higher free energy than the initial

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000
reactants posses. And
this higher free energy,

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000
that they need to acquire in order
to move over the hill and down into

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.000
the valley, is called the energy of
activation, the activation energy.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000
And, therefore, if I were to
supply these reactants with energy,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.000
for instance, let's say I were
to heat up these reactants and

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.000
therefore give them a higher degree
of thermal energy which they might

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:03.000
be able to use to move up
to this high energy state.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
I supplied them with free
energy by giving them heat.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
Then they might be able to move up
to here and then roll down the hill.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
But in the absence of actually
actively intervening and supplying

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.000
them that energy,
they'll remain right here,

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
and they may remain right
there for a million years,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
even though in principle, if
they were to reach down here,

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.000
they would be much happier in
terms of reaching a much lower

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.000
energy state. To
state the obvious,

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000
all these kinds of reactions wish
to reach the lowest energy state

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000
possible. But in real-time it can't
happen if there is a high energy of

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.000
activation. Now,
what do enzymes do?

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:47.000
As always, I'm glad I asked that
question. What they do is they

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.000
lower the energy of activation.
And this is in one sense obvious,

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000
and in one sense it's subtle,
because enzymes have no affect on

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000
the free energy state of the
reactants, they have no affect on

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:03.000
the free energy of the products.
All they do is to lower the hump,

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.000
and they may lower
it very substantially.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.000
And because they
lower it substantially,

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.000
it might be that some of
the reactants here may,

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
just through a chance,
acquisition of thermal energy,

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.000
be able to move over the much
lowered hump and move down into this

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.000
state right here. Now, the
actual difference in the

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000
Gibbs free energy is
totally unaffected.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:35.000
All that happens is that the enzyme,
by lowering the energy of activation,

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:40.000
make this possible in real-time.
The fact is that ultimately, if one

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:46.000
were to plot many kinds of
reactions, many reactions,

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:51.000
as is indicated here, have a
very high activation energy,

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:56.000
and therefore we look at it like
this. But there could be other

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:02.000
reactions which might have an
activation energy that looks like

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:07.000
this, almost nothing at all.
And these reactions could happen

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.000
spontaneously at room temperature
in the absence of any intervention by

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:15.000
an enzyme. For example, let's
say we're talking about a

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000
carboxyl group which discharges
a proton. We've talked about that

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.000
already. Well, that reaction
happens spontaneously

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.000
at room temperature. It
doesnt need an enzyme to make

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.000
it happen. It can happen
because there's essentially not

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.000
energy of activation.
But the great majority of

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.000
biochemical reactions do have
such an activation energy,

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:44.000
and therefore do require a lowering
like this in order to take place.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:49.000
Now, let's imagine other versions
of the energy profile of a reaction.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.000
And keep in mind that what I'm
showing here on the abscissa is just

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:58.000
the course of the reaction.
You could imagine I'm not really

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:05.000
plotting time. I'm just
talking about a situation

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:13.000
where to the left the reaction
hasn't happened and to the right it

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:21.000
has happened. Can you see this
over there? Then I won't write over

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:30.000
there. All right.
Let's see if this works.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:36.000
Boy, here we are in the 21st century
and we still haven't worked this out.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:42.000
OK. Everybody can see
this right here, right? OK.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:48.000
So, look. Let's imagine we have
a reaction that looks like this,

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:54.000
a reaction profile that looks like
this, where these two energies are

00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:00.000
actually equivalent. OK?
I've tried to draw them on.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000
Well, they're not exactly, but
they're pretty much on exactly

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.000
the same level. And let's
say we start out with a

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:13.000
large number of molecules right over
here. Now, if there were an enzyme

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:17.000
around, the enzyme might lower
the activation energy and,

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:21.000
in so doing, make it possible for
molecules to tunnel through this

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:26.000
hill and move over here. The
fact that when a molecule gets

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.000
over here it has the same free
energy as over there means that the

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:35.000
catalyst may, in principle,
also facilitate a back reaction.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000
What do I mean by a back reaction?
I mean going in exactly the

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:42.000
opposite direction. And
so, once molecules over here

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.000
are formed, the energy lowering
affects of the enzyme may allow them

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:50.000
to move in both directions.
And, therefore, what we will have

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.000
is ultimately the
establishment of an equilibrium.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.000
If these two energy
states are equivalent then,

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.000
I will tell you, 50% of the
molecules end up here and 50% of the

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.000
molecules end up here. And
here we're beginning now to

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000
wrestle between two different
independent concepts,

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.000
the rate of the reaction and the
equilibrium state of the reaction.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:19.000
Note that the enzyme has no affect
whatsoever on the equilibrium state.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.000
These two are at equal free
energies, the equilibrium state.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.000
Whether the energy barrier is
this high or whether it's this

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:32.000
high is irrelevant. The
fact is if the enzyme makes

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:36.000
possible this motion back and forth,
the ultimate equilibrium state will

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.000
be 50% of the molecules here
and 50% of the molecules there.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.000
And, therefore, the enzyme really
only affects the rate at which the

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:48.000
reaction takes place. Will
it happen in a microsecond or

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.000
will it happen in a day or will
it happen in a million years?

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.000
The enzyme has no affect whatsoever
on the ultimate end product,

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.000
which in this case
is the equilibrium.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:06.000
Of course, there is a simple
mathematic formalism which relates

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:12.000
the difference in free
energies with the equilibrium.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:18.000
Here we might have a situation
where 80% of the molecules end up at

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:24.000
equilibrium over here and 20% end
up here. Or, we might end up as a

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:30.000
state where 99. % of the
molecules end up here and 0.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.000
% of the molecules end up here.
But that ultimate equilibrium state

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.000
is no way influenced by the
enzyme. They just make it happen in

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:42.000
real-time. And, therefore,
to repeat and echo a

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:46.000
point I made last time, if most
biochemical reactions are to

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:50.000
occur in real-time, i.e.,
in the order of seconds or

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:54.000
minutes, an enzyme has to be
around to make sure they happen.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:58.000
In the absence of such an
enzyme of its intermediation,

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:02.000
it just won't happen in real-time.
Even though, in principle,

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:06.000
it's energetically favored. So,
let's just keep that very much

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:11.000
in mind in the course of discussions
that happen. And let's just begin

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:15.000
now to look at an important
energy-generating reaction in the

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:20.000
cell which is called glycolysis.
We already know the prefix glycol.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.000
Glyco refers to sugar. And lysis,
L-Y-S-I-S refers to the breakdown of

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:29.000
a certain compound. I
am not going to ask you,

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.000
nor is anyone else in the room
going to ask you to memorize this

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:37.000
sequence of reactions. But
I'd like you to look at it and

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:41.000
see what take-home lessons
we can distill out of that,

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:45.000
what wisdom we can learn from
looking at such a complex series of

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:49.000
reactions. Perhaps, the first
thing we can learn is that

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:53.000
when we think about biochemical
reactions, we don't think of them as

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:57.000
happening in isolation.
Here I'm talking about,

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:01.000
for example, in this case I could be
talking A plus B going to C plus D,

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:05.000
and there might be a back
reaction to reach equilibrium.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:09.000
And we're just isolating that simple
reaction from all others around it.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:13.000
But in the real world in living
cells most reactions are parts of

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.000
very long pathways where each of
these steps here indicates one of

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:21.000
the others, a step in the pathway.
What we're interested in here is

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:25.000
how glucose, which I advertised two
lectures ago as being an important

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:30.000
energy source, is
actually broken down.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.000
How does the cell harvest the
energy, which is inherent in glucose,

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:38.000
in order to generate, among other
things, ATP, which we've said

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:42.000
repeatedly is the energy currency?
ATP is used by hundreds of

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:47.000
different biochemical reactions
in order to make them happen.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:51.000
These other biochemical
reactions are endergonic,

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:55.000
they require the investment of
energy, and almost invariably,

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:59.000
but not invariably, but almost
invariably the cell will grab hold

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:04.000
of an ATP molecule, break it
down usually to AMP or ADP.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.000
And then utilize the energy, which
derives from breaking down ATP,

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:13.000
it will invest that energy
in an endergonic reaction,

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:18.000
which in the otherwise would not
happen. So, here we reach the idea

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:23.000
that perhaps by investing energy
in a reaction, the equilibrium is

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:28.000
shifted. Because by
investing energy, actually,

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:33.000
the cell is able to lower the free
energy state between these two.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.000
And that makes it possible for their
equilibrium to be much more favored.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:40.000
Let's look at this glycolytic
pathway. Glycolytic refers,

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:44.000
obviously, to glycolysis. And
here we start out with glucose.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:48.000
We're drawing it out flat rather
than the circular structure we

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:52.000
talked about last time. And
let's look at what happens here,

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:56.000
again, not because anyone
wants you to memorize this,

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:00.000
but because some of the details
are in themselves very illustrative.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:04.000
The goal of this exercise is
to create ATP for the cell,

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:08.000
but the first step in the
reaction is actually totally

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:12.000
counterproductive. Look
at the first thing that

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:16.000
happens. The first thing that
happens is that the cell invests an

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:20.000
ATP molecule to make glucose-6-phosphate.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:24.000
I've advertised the goal of
this is to generate ATP from ADP,

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:28.000
adenosine diphosphate.
But the first thing here,

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:32.000
this is an endergonic reaction in
which the cell invests energy to

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.000
create this molecule here.
So, this doesn't make sense.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:38.000
But ostensively it must make sense,
at one level or another, because you

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:42.000
and I, we're all here,
and everybody in this room,

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.000
at least this moment
is metabolically active.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.000
All right. So, we've
got this molecule here,

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.000
glucose-6-phosphate.
And this can isomerize.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:55.000
You see, here's glucose-6-phosphate, fructose-6-phosphate.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.000
And, the fact of the matter is,
there's no oxidation reduction

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:02.000
reaction here. It's
just an isomerization.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:06.000
And this molecule and this molecule
are virtually in the same free

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:10.000
energy state. It happens to be the
case that their profile will look

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:14.000
very much like the one I drew you
before. Their energy profile will

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:18.000
look like this. And one
needs an enzyme to lower it,

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.000
but there's no energy that needs to
be invested in converting one to the

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:26.000
other because they're very similar
molecules and therefore incomparable

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:31.000
free energy states. Now
look at the next step.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:35.000
The next step is again
another ostensively totally

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:39.000
counterproductive way of
generating energy. Because,

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:44.000
once again, ATP, the gamma-phosphate,
its energy is invested in creating a

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:48.000
dephosphorylated hexose, fructose
1, 6-diphosphate where the

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:52.000
numbers refer obviously to
the identities of the carbon.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:57.000
And now we have a
dephosphorylated fructose molecule.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:01.000
And so here you can actually
see what the three-dimensional,

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:05.000
what we would imagine closer to what
the three-dimensional structures of

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:09.000
these molecules look like. And
we shouldn't focus this time on

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:13.000
whether it's this or this.
For all practical purposes,

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:17.000
let's just focus on this
pathway here. And here,

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:21.000
for the first time, what now
happens is that this hexose

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:25.000
is broken down into two trioses,
i.e., into two three carbon sugars.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:30.000
And this is a slightly
exergonic reaction.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:33.000
It yields, it happens without
the investment of energy.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:37.000
And there's an enzyme, once
again, that's required in order

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:40.000
to catalyze it. But
let's be really clear now.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:44.000
Now we have to follow
the fate of two molecules.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:47.000
The first triose and the second
triose. They have different names,

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:51.000
but we're not going to focus on the
names. One thing you notice about

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:54.000
these trioses is that they're
readily interconvertible.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:58.000
Once again, we can image
that we have a situation that

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:02.000
looks like this. These are
flipping back and forth.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:06.000
And therefore, for all practical
purposes from our point of view,

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:10.000
these two are equivalent because
they can be exchanged virtually

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:14.000
instantaneously one with the other.
Now, so far we've actually expended

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:19.000
energy. We haven't harvested
energy. But, keep in mind,

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:23.000
the old economic dictum; you have
to invest money to make money.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:27.000
And that's what's going on here.
The first thing that happens is we

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:32.000
have an oxidation reaction.
What's an oxidation reaction?

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:36.000
We want to strip some electrons,
a pair of electrons off of this

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:41.000
particular triose,
the 3 carbon sugar.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:46.000
And by stripping off a pair of
electrons we donate the electrons

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:50.000
from NAD+ to NADH. And here
these structures are given

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:55.000
in your book. But NADH, it
turns out, is the electrons are

00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:00.000
pulled away from the triose and
they're used to reduce NAD+ to NADH.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:04.000
Keep in mind that in an oxidation
reaction, one molecule that's being

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:08.000
oxidized is deprived, is
denied a pair of electrons.

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:12.000
The other molecule that's
being reduced, in this case NAD,

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:16.000
acquires a pair of electrons.
And you can focus, if you want,

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.000
about the charge of these molecules,
one or the other. But, keep in mind,

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:24.000
that in these oxidation reduction
reactions, whether it's plus charged

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:28.000
or minus charged is irrelevant.
The real name of the game is the

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:31.000
electrons. Forget
about the protons,

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:35.000
whether it has a plus charge or it's
neutral. The real name of the game

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:38.000
here is that two electrons are being
used to reduce this molecule to this.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:42.000
By the way, third mistake
I forgot to tell you before,

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:45.000
there's a double-bond in one of the
pyrimidines in the book that doesn't

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:49.000
make any sense. Whoever
finds it gets a prize,

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:53.000
but no one's figured out
what the prize is yet. So,

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:56.000
this double bond gets reduced.
You see the difference between this

00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:00.000
and this over here. And
this NADH, it turns out,

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:04.000
is a high energy molecule. The
street value of NADH is three

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:10.000
ATPs, i.e., in the mitochondria NADH
can be used to generate three ATPs,

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:15.000
and that's worth something. So,
NADH on its own is a high energy

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:20.000
molecule. It can't be used for that
many things, but it can be pulled

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:26.000
into the mitochondria where
it's converted to three ATPs.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:31.000
So, we say, well, we're starting
to make some money out of this

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:37.000
investment because we've
made, in fact, these NADHs.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:41.000
See right here. Why
do we say two NADHs?

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:46.000
Because there are two trioses we're
working with, and each one of the

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:50.000
trioses gives you an NADH.
So, everything that's going on

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:55.000
after this, starting from the top
here, is now double because we're

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:59.000
looking at the parallel behaviors
of two identical three carbon sugars.

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:04.000
So, here we've so far generated,
in principle, six ATPs.

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:08.000
How much did we invest
already up to this point? Two.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:13.000
We invested two but we harvested
six. Already we're starting to make

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:18.000
a little money because I told you
the street value of an NADH is three

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:23.000
ATPs on the black market.
OK, so what happens next?

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:27.000
Next is another good thing.
Each of the trioses, one can

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:32.000
actually cause each of the
trioses to generate an ATP molecule

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:36.000
from an ADP.
What happens here?

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:40.000
It turns out that this phosphate
over here is actually in a pretty

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:43.000
high energy state, in no
small part because of electron

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:47.000
negative-negative repulsion. And
by stripping this phosphate off

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:51.000
this high energy phosphate
stripped off of this molecule here,

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:54.000
whose name we will ignore,
allows us to phosphorylate an ATP.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:58.000
And since there are two
trioses being converted, we're

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:02.000
going to get two
ATPs. So, in effect,

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:06.000
now we're actually ahead.
We started out investing two,

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:10.000
we got six back from the NADHs,
and we're getting two back here.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:14.000
So, we've made two ATPs. This
is a good thing. Keep in mind,

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:19.000
ADP is lower energy, ATP is
a high energy. Once again,

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:23.000
we have an isomerization where
these two molecules are at comparable

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:27.000
states here and here, where
the phosphate just jumps over

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:32.000
to this state. And this
hydrolyzes spontaneously

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:37.000
and we get this molecule right over
here, phosphoenolpyruvate at the end.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:42.000
And, once again,
we harvest two ATPs,

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:47.000
one ATP from each of the trioses.
And we end up, at the end of this

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:52.000
reaction, with pyruvate. And
you'll say this is terrific

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:57.000
because we invested two ATPs, we
harvested four, plus we got six

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:03.000
from the NADHs, right? Two
NADHs, each NADH gives us three

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:11.000
each, so let's do the arithmetic.
Let's do the balance sheet. We

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:18.000
invested to begin with, with
the one glucose, we invested

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:26.000
two ATPs. That was early on. Then
the return was first two NADHs,

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:33.000
which I've told you equals six ATPs.
Because an NADH is worth three ATPs.

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:39.000
This is so far good. And now
subsequently we've made four ATPs so

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:46.000
that the net yield looks pretty
useful. Six plus four is ten minus

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:52.000
two, a profit of eight ATPs
from one glucose molecule.

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:59.000
This is terrific you may
say, but there's a rub.

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:04.000
There's a catch. If
glycolysis is occurring in the

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:10.000
absence of oxygen, if that
happens, then we have a

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:15.000
problem here, because the only way
that these NADHs can generate ATP is

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:21.000
if there is oxygen around to take
these electron pairs and use them to

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:27.000
reduce an oxygen molecule.
That is, by the way, part of the

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:32.000
reason we breathe. Keep in
mind that when you generate

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:36.000
an NADH from an NAD molecule,
you need to regenerate the NAD.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:40.000
You can't just accumulate more and
more NADHs. You need to regenerate

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:44.000
the NAD. And,
therefore, this NADH,

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:48.000
with their electron pairs, the
electron pairs have some to be

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:52.000
disposed of. You have to regenerate
NAD. You can't just make more and

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:56.000
more and more of this. So,
how do cells get rid of it?

00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:00.000
Well, how they get
rid of it is simple.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:05.000
You take the electron pairs
and you slap them onto oxygen,

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:10.000
and that's really called combustion.
And you get a lot of energy out of

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:16.000
that. But what happens if all of
this is occurring anaerobically?

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:21.000
Anaerobically means the reaction is
occurring in the absence of oxygen.

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:27.000
Well, if you have a yeast that's
growing 14 feet underground,

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:31.000
this is happening anaerobically.
If you have a yeast that's

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:35.000
fermenting in a big keg to make
wine or beer, it's also probably

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:39.000
happening anaerobically. If
you start running in a 100 yard

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:43.000
sprint, or let's say you had to
run a mile, then initially there's

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:47.000
enough oxygen, there's
a lot of oxygen around to

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:51.000
allow you to get rid of these NADHs
and dump the electrons that they

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:55.000
have acquired onto the oxygen
molecule. And that's fine.

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:59.000
That's worth a lot because,
in effect, what you're doing is

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:03.000
you're taking oxygen and hydrogen
and you're combusting them together.

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:07.000
And that's great. But as
you start running down the

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:12.000
street, soon the oxygen supply to
your muscles is going to run out,

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:16.000
and soon a lot of the energy
production in your muscles happens

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:21.000
anaerobically. Why?
Because you can't get oxygen

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:26.000
quickly enough to your muscles,
and therefore, for a period of time,

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:30.000
you start feeling that burning
sensation in your muscles because

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:35.000
oxidation of NADH isn't happening.
And these NADHs instead are

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:40.000
regenerated by another way.
How are they regenerated? The

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:45.000
electron pairs of the NADHs,
must be, are dumped back onto this

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:50.000
molecule right here, pyruvate.
They're not used to make

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:55.000
ATP because they can't be used to
make ATP because there's no oxygen

00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:01.000
around to accept the electron pairs
that these NADHs have acquired.

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:05.000
And so, what happens
with these valuable NADHs?

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:09.000
Under anaerobic conditions
this doesn't happen.

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:14.000
These NADHs are used instead,
their electrons are donated to our

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:18.000
friend pyruvate here,
these three carbon sugar.

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:23.000
And what happens, when they are
donated back to the pyruvate,

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:27.000
in order to regenerate NAD you need
more NAD to pick up to use later in

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:32.000
the reaction, to use over
again in another reaction.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:36.000
When you donate the electrons
from NADH back onto pyruvate,

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:41.000
what happens? You get lactic acid.
Lactic acid is what makes your

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:45.000
muscles burn when you're running
very quickly and you can't get

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:50.000
enough oxygen into them to
begin to burn up the NADH.

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:55.000
So, instead of using NADH to
generate ATP, it's diverted to make

00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:00.000
lactic acid. That's in one sense
good because you regenerate NAD.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:04.000
Why do you need to regenerate
NAD? Because you need a lot of NAD

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:09.000
around for the earlier steps
in the reaction. Keep in mind,

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:13.000
early in the reaction you need NAD
here. If you don't regenerate it

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:18.000
then glycolysis grinds to a halt.
So, even though you make NADH and

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:23.000
it's a good thing in principle,
in practice it has to be recycled.

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:27.000
And if it's not recycled to make
more new NAD to allow this step to

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:32.000
happen then the whole glycolytic
reaction will shut down

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:37.000
and you're in a
mess. However, sadly,

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:41.000
in the absence of oxygen, the
only way to recycle this is to

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:46.000
dump these electrons not onto
oxygen which is energy rich,

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:50.000
it's dump them back onto pyruvic
acid creating lactic acid.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:55.000
So, you reduce this bond
right here. So, you get CH,

00:34:55.000 --> 00:35:00.000
COH. This bond right here is
reduced and you get lactic acid.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:04.000
So, instead of a carbonyl bond
here you have CH and COH right here,

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:09.000
that's a reduction reaction. And
now you're able to regenerate the

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:13.000
NAD. And now you say that's a
great thing. But, keep in mind,

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:18.000
that now the entire glycolytic
reaction, how much is our net profit

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:23.000
now? Before I was gloating about
the fact that we made eight ATPs,

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:27.000
we netted eight ATPs out of this.
What are we back down to now?

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:32.000
What's the whole net yield
now? Well, the TAs can't answer.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:36.000
It's two, because we invested
two and we got out four.

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:40.000
And it's only two. Now,
why is this so interesting?

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:45.000
Well, until about six hundred
million years ago there wasn't that

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:49.000
much oxygen in the atmosphere.
And in the absence of oxygen this

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:54.000
is almost the only reaction that
could be used in order to generate

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:58.000
energy. And about six hundred
million years ago more and more

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:03.000
oxygen from photosynthesis
became dumped into the atmosphere.

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:08.000
And soon oxygen became available
to organisms like our ancestors.

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:13.000
And then they could actually begin
to recycle this NADH in a much more

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:18.000
productive way. And as a
consequence what happened,

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:23.000
instead of having glycolysis
yielding two, we could go up to this

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:28.000
theoretical eight because the NADHs
could now deposit their electrons on

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:33.000
oxygen, which is
much more profitable.

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:39.000
In fact, I've just told you now
that in the absence of oxygen you can

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:45.000
only make two ATPs. I will
tell you, without providing

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:51.000
it to you, that in the presence
of oxygen you can make 34 ATPs.

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:57.000
And 34 is, we can agree,
much better than two in the

00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:01.000
presence of oxygen. Higher
life forms could not evolve

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:05.000
until this much more effective
way of generating energy became

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:09.000
available. And, therefore,
if our ancestors who

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:13.000
lived longer than six hundred
million years ago were very sluggish

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:17.000
and they weren't very smart,
the reason why they were sluggish

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:21.000
and they weren't very smart is
because they couldn't generate the

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:25.000
energy that was required to
efficiently drive metabolism.

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:29.000
The metabolism,
anaerobic metabolism, i.

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:33.000
., occurring in the absence of
energy, is extremely inefficient.

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:39.000
It just doesn't happen very well.
Now, what actually happens if we

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:45.000
have oxygen around? Well,
what happens is something

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:51.000
like this. We take the pyruvate,
which is the product of glycolysis

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:57.000
and which is this much
more primitive pathway,

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:02.000
and we dump it into the mitochondria.
And now we generate through this

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:08.000
cycle here, which I'm not
asking you memorize, please,

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:13.000
don't do that. We generate the
reactions which go from here and get

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:19.000
us up to this 34 ATP yield per
glucose. And the essence of the

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:24.000
citric acid cycle, which
happens in the mitochondria,

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:30.000
keep in mind that the
mitochondria look like this.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:34.000
Keep in mind that the mitochondrion
are the decedents of bacteria which

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:39.000
parasitized the cytoplasm of cells
probably 1.5 billion years ago.

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:43.000
But if we now look at what
happens in the mitochondrion,

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:48.000
the pyruvate that we generated in
the cytosol, in the soluble part of

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:53.000
the cytoplasm is now pumped into
the mitochondria, and there's a whole

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:57.000
series of reactions that go on
here, which takes this three-carbon

00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:02.000
sugar. The first thing
that happens is that

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:06.000
carbon is boiled off. Carbon
dioxide, that's released.

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:10.000
Now we're down to a two carbon
sugar. And then this two carbon

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:14.000
sugar is added to a four carbon
sugar and progressively oxidized.

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:19.000
And as it's oxidized what's spun
off? Well, what's spun off is,

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:23.000
for example, there's NADH
which is spun off, there's ATP.

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:27.000
See, there's an NADH which is spun
off. Here's an NADH that's spun off.

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:32.000
Here is a cousin of NADH.
It's called FADH which,

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:36.000
once again, generates a high
energy molecule. Once again,

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:41.000
the carbon molecules are oxidized,
electrons are stripped away and used

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:45.000
to create these high energy
molecules, FADH and NADH.

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:49.000
By the way, FADH, a cousin of NADH,
is only worth two ATPs on the open

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:54.000
market. Whereas, NADH, as
I've told you repeatedly,

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:58.000
is worth three. And by the time we
add up all of the NADHs that have

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:03.000
been generated by this cycling
and the carbon dioxides that are

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:07.000
releases, at the end of this cycle
here we start with two carbons,

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:12.000
add it to four and we
get a six carbon molecule.

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:16.000
We spew off some carbon dioxides
here and go back to four carbon

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:20.000
sugar. Add another two, go
up to six carbons. Go around

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:24.000
again, spin around the wheel.
And each time we do that we

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:28.000
generate a lot of NADHs,
we generate a lot of FADHs,

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:33.000
and we generate a lot of ATP.
In all cases, these are highly

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:39.000
profitable reactions simply because
the NADHs and the FADHs can be used

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:45.000
in the mitochondrion to generate
ATP. So, let's look at the energy

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:51.000
profile of the entire thing. Put
it all together. This is where

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:57.000
we started out at the beginning,
and this is the end of glycolysis,

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:02.000
OK? So, now we're
adding up the energy

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:06.000
profiles of the whole sequence
of reactions that constituted

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:10.000
glycolysis, which begins up here
and ends right here because pyruvate,

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:14.000
as you will recall, is
the product of glycolysis,

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:18.000
the first step. The
Krebs Cycle happens,

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:22.000
or sometimes it's called
the Citric Acid Cycle. So,

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:26.000
let's just get these words straight.
Citric Acid Cycle because it

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:30.000
happens to be one of the cycles,
or it's sometimes called the Krebs

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:35.000
Cycle after the person who
really discovered it, Krebs.

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:39.000
The Krebs Cycle begins here.
You see how the shading changes

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:43.000
from pyruvate. And here
we go all the way down

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:47.000
there. And let's now look at what
happens in terms of energy exchange.

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:51.000
Recall that early on we needed to
invest ATPs to kick up the energy

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:55.000
state up to here. We
invested ATPs at this stage

00:41:55.000 --> 00:42:00.000
right here, and then we
began to get some back.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:04.000
We got these two NADHs, one
NADH coming from each of the

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:08.000
three carbon sugars. We got
some more ATPs here and we

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:12.000
got some more ATPs here, but
these NADHs could not be used

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:17.000
productively for generating
ATP in the absence of oxygen,

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:21.000
but in the presence of oxygen
now we can begin to use these very

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:25.000
profitably. Each of these makes
three ATPs and each of these,

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:30.000
obviously, makes ATPs. And
then let's look at what happens

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:34.000
in the mitochondrion. Keep
in mind here's the borderline

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:38.000
between the cytosol, the
cytoplasm and the mitochondrion.

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:42.000
Here is where the oxygen is
actually used and here we generate

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:46.000
all these NADHs here, here
and here, FADHs. And I keep

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:50.000
saying, and it's still true,
just in spite of the fact I keep

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:54.000
saying it, that these NADHs
can be converted to ATPs,

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:58.000
and the ATPs can then be diffused,
transmitted throughout the entire

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:02.000
cell where they're then used
invested in endergonic reactions.

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:06.000
Here we see all these NADHs.
And look at the overall change in

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:11.000
free energy. The initial steps
in glycolysis didn't really take

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:15.000
advantage. Glucose has inherent in
it almost 680 kilocalories per mole

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:20.000
of energy. It's pretty high up here.
But by the time we get from here

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:25.000
down to here, there's an
enormous release of energy,

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:30.000
it's harvested in the form of these
molecules which are then reinvested.

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:34.000
In the absence of oxygen, this
entire procedure can only go

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:38.000
from here down to here. And
a lot of this drop from six to

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:42.000
seven is futile because we
have to reinvest this NADH.

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:47.000
These cannot be used,
actually, to generate more ATPs,

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:51.000
as I've said repeatedly. So,
this means in the end that we can

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:55.000
generate an enormous amount
of energy in the form of these

00:43:55.000 --> 00:44:01.000
coupled reactions.
Having said that,

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:08.000
let's actually look at what
happens inside of the mitochondria.

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:15.000
Inside of the mitochondria there
are actually different physical

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:22.000
compartments. See the blue space
there, the intermembrane space,

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:30.000
the blue spaces there? The
matrix is on the inside.

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:35.000
The intermembrane space is between
the two, the inner and the outer

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:40.000
membrane, and outside is the
cytoplasm. The outer membrane,

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:45.000
the inner membrane, in between it.
So, look what happens, actually, in

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:50.000
the mitochondrion. Those
NADHs are used to pump

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:55.000
protons from the inner space of the
mitochondrion into the intermembrane

00:44:55.000 --> 00:45:00.000
space. I'm not showing
you that happening.

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:05.000
But you'll have to take it on my
word. So, protons pictured here are

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:10.000
extracted from NADH and FADH, and
they're used to pump protons out

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:15.000
here. And, therefore, protons
are moved from here to here.

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:20.000
Obviously, when you pump protons
out the pH gets lower on the outside

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:25.000
than it does on the inside,
and because there's a gradient,

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:30.000
there's a higher concentration of
protons here than on the inside.

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:34.000
The protons begin to accumulate
outside here in the intermembrane

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:39.000
space. Are they in the cytoplasm?
No. They're in the space between

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:44.000
the inner and the outer membrane.
You start to accumulate in this

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:49.000
blue space lots of protons.
And this pumping of protons into

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:54.000
the space between the two
membranes requires energy,

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:59.000
and the energy comes from
our friends NADH and FADH

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:04.000
as it turns out. They are
responsible for causing

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:08.000
this accumulation of protons in
the space between the inner and the

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:12.000
outer membrane. So, now
we get lots of protons out

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:16.000
there. And what happens now,
the protons like to flow back in

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:20.000
because there is a higher
concentration here as they are

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:24.000
inside the space that's called
the mitochondrial matrix,

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:29.000
on the inside of the
mitochondrion. So, what happens?

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:32.000
Here, yet another Nobel Prize
winning discovery is the discovery

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:36.000
of a very interesting molecule, or
complex of proteins I should say,

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:40.000
that looks in three-dimensions
roughly like this.

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:44.000
And what this complex does is as
the protons flow through the inner

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:48.000
channel here, they're moving
down an energy gradient.

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:52.000
They're going from a state of high
concentration to a state of low

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:56.000
concentration.
What that does,

00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:00.000
that diffusional pressure
actually yields energy.

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:05.000
And this complex right here harvests
that energy in order to convert ADP

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:10.000
into ATP. So, when I
talk about NADH as being

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:15.000
worth, each of them being worth
three ATPs, what I'm really talking

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:20.000
about is the fact that NADHs can
be used to pump protons in the

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:25.000
mitochondria outside here, and
these protons can then be used,

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:31.000
can then be pumped, can then flow
in this way through this proton pump,

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:36.000
which then uses ADP in the
inner cavity of the mitochondria

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:40.000
to create ATP. And
here we get finally the

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:44.000
conversion of ADP into ATP. We
can realize, finally, this much

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:48.000
promised benefit. And then
these ATP molecules are

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:52.000
exported from the mitochondria
throughout the entire cell and used

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:56.000
to drive many reactions.
We've already encountered one

00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:00.000
important set of reactions,
and those reactions are the

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:04.000
polymerization of nucleic acids.
Now, one final point I want to make

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:08.000
is the following. We've
just talked about metabolic,

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:12.000
we've talked about the pathway
of energy production in the cell.

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:16.000
And you might have had the
illusion, for a brief instant,

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:20.000
that those are all, that's the sum
of all the biochemical reactions in

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:24.000
the cell. But, in fact,
if we plot out all the

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:28.000
biochemical reactions in the cell,
they're much more complicated. Here

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:31.000
is the glycolytic pathway. You
see it right down here where

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:35.000
nothing is named? Here is
the Krebs Cycle right here.

00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:39.000
And we're not even talking about
energy here. And as molecules move

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:43.000
down this pathway from here
to here to here to here,

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:46.000
some of these molecules are
diverted for other applications.

00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:50.000
Not for energy production
but for other applications.

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:54.000
And what happens out here, they
are converted through a series

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:58.000
of complex biochemical steps
into other essential biological

00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:02.000
molecules. What
do I mean by that?

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:06.000
If you give E. coli, a bacterium,
you give it a simple carbon source

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:10.000
like glucose and you give it
phosphate and you give it a simple

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:14.000
nitrogen source like
ammonium acetate or something,

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:19.000
E. coli can, from those simple
atoms generate all the amino acids,

00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:23.000
can generate the purines and the
pyrimidines, can generate all kinds

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:27.000
of different complex biological
molecules just from those

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:33.000
simple building blocks. And
so, the process of biosynthesis

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:40.000
involves not only the
creation of macromolecules,

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:47.000
these steps of what are called
intermediary metabolism are used to

00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:54.000
synthesize all the other biochemical
entities that one needs to make a

00:49:54.000 --> 00:50:01.000
cell. They're used to synthesize
purines and pyrimidines.

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:05.000
They're used to synthesize lipids,
they're used to synthesize amino

00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:09.000
acids, and they're used to
synthesize literally hundreds of

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:13.000
other compounds. And when
we see this chart like

00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:18.000
this, and nobody on the face of the
planet has ever memorized this chart,

00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:22.000
each one of these steps, going
from one molecule to the next,

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:26.000
represents another biochemical
reaction. And the vast majority of

00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:31.000
these biochemical reactions
going from A to B to C to D.

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:35.000
Each one of these steps requires
the intervention of an enzyme,

00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:39.000
a catalyst that is specialized
for that particular step.

00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:44.000
So, this begins to give you an
appreciation of how many distinct

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:48.000
biochemical steps one needs in a
cell. The numbers probably to make

00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:53.000
a simple cell, you probably
need about a thousand

00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:57.000
distinct biochemical reactions,
each of one of which requires the

00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:02.000
involvement of an enzyme.
And many of these steps,

00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:06.000
importantly, many of these
biochemical steps are endergonic

00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:11.000
reactions. Where do they get the
energy for driving these reactions

00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:15.000
forward if they're endergonic?
ATP. So, the ATP from the energy

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:20.000
generating furnace down here is the
then spread throughout the cell to

00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:25.000
power all of these energy consuming
reactions. Have a great weekend.

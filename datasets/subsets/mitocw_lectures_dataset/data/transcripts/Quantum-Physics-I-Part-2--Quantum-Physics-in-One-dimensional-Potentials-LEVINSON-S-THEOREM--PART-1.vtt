00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:08.340
PROFESSOR: Levinson's theorem,
in terms of derivations,

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.130
that we do in this
course, this is probably

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.390
the most subtle derivation
of the semester.

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:20.190
It's not difficult, but
it's kind of interesting

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:23.550
and a little subtle.

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.550
And it's curious, because
it relates to things that

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.450
seem to be fairly unrelated.

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.090
But the key thing
that one has to do

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.560
is you have to use something.

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.350
How all of the
sudden are you going

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.320
to relate phase shifts
to bound states?

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.120
The one thing you
have to imagine

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.890
is that if you have
a potential and you

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:56.610
have states of a potential,
if the potential changes,

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.000
the states change.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.570
But here comes
something very nice.

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.230
They never appear or disappear.

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:11.230
And this is something probably
you haven't thought about this

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:12.670
all that much.

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:19.500
Because you had, for example,
a square, finite square well.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.920
If you made this more deep,
you've got more bound states.

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.670
If you made it less deep,
the bound states disappear.

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.520
What does it mean the
bound states disappear?

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.460
Nothing, really can disappear.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:39.040
What really is happening,
if you have the bounds,

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.230
the square well.

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:45.360
You have a couple of
bound states, say.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.660
But then you have an infinity
of scatterings states.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:59.550
And as you make this
potential less shallow,

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:04.000
the last bound state
is approaching here.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.460
And at one state,
it changes identity

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:12.660
and becomes a scatterings
state, but it never gets lost.

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.330
And how, when you make
this deeper and deeper

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.300
you get more state, is
the scattering state

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:24.430
suddenly borrowing, lending
you a state that goes down?

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.170
The states never get
lost or disappear.

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.320
And you will, say, how
could you demonstrate that?

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.270
That sounds like
science fiction,

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.120
because, well, there's
infinitely many states here.

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.850
How do you know it borrowed one?

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:43.140
Well, you can do it by putting
it in a very large box.

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.750
And then the states
here are going

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.790
to be finitely
countable and discrete.

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.200
And then you can
track and see indeed

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.320
how the states become bound.

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.470
So you'd never lose
or gain states.

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:04.180
And that's a very, very powerful
statement about quantum states

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.800
in a system.

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.410
So this is what
we're going to need

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:09.760
to prove Levinson's theorem.

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:19.575
So Levinson theorem theorem--

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:28.490
so it relates a number of
bound states of the potential

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:33.810
to the excursion
of the phase shift.

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:38.420
So let's state it completely.

00:03:42.650 --> 00:04:01.670
It relates the number N of
bound states of the potential

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:18.390
to the excursion, excursion of
the phase from E equals 0 to E

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:20.529
equals infinity.

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:27.690
So in other words, it says
that N is 1 over pi delta of 0

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:32.460
minus delta of
infinity, a number

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:35.760
of bound states
of your potential

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:44.480
is predicted by the behavior of
the phase shift of scattering.

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:48.250
So how do we do this?

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:51.050
This is what we want to prove.

00:04:51.050 --> 00:05:00.780
So consider, again, our
potential of range R and 0

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:03.270
here and here is x.

00:05:06.964 --> 00:05:11.800
And I want you to be
able to count states,

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:15.950
but discovering states are
a continuous set of states.

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:21.370
So in order to
count states, we're

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:23.740
going to put a
wall here, as well,

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:32.600
at some big distance L
much bigger than A than R.

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.610
And we're going, therefore--

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:37.630
now the states are
going to be quantized.

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:40.140
They're never going be
quite scatterings states.

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:42.440
They're going to look
like scatterings states.

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:45.620
But they're precisely
in the way that they

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:49.300
vanished at this point.

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:52.660
Now you would say, OK, that's
already a little dangerous

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:53.230
to be.

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:56.770
Oh, you've changed the
problem a little, yes.

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:58.660
But we're going
to do the analysis

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:04.090
and see if the result depends
on L. If it doesn't depend on L

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:07.210
and L is very large, we'll
take the limit this L goes

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:08.060
to infinity.

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:12.420
And we claim, we have answer.

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:21.360
So we argue that L is
a regulator, regulator

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:35.850
to avoid a continuum,
continuum of states

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:37.755
to avoid that
continuum of states.

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:47.550
All right, so let's
begin to count.

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:52.370
To count this thing,
we start with the case

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:55.440
where there is no
potential again.

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:00.980
And why is that?

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:02.600
Because we're going
to try to compare

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:05.270
the situation with no
potential to the situation

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:06.630
with potential.

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:15.800
So imagine let V identical
is 0, no potential

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:25.320
and consider positive
energy states.

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:27.420
These are the only
states that exist.

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:31.125
There are no bound states,
because the potential is 0.

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:37.330
Well, the solutions
were found before, we

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:44.020
mentioned that these are what we
call phi effects or sine of kx.

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:49.420
But now we require that
phi of L is equal to 0,

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:52.270
because we do have
the wall there.

00:07:52.270 --> 00:08:06.160
And therefore, si of kl must
be 0 and kl must be n pi and n

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:10.020
is 1, 2 to infinity.

00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:17.056
You know we manage with the
wall to discretize this state,

00:08:17.056 --> 00:08:21.780
because the whole world is now
an infinite, a very big box,

00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:24.260
not infinite, but very big.

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.160
So you've discrete the state.

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:29.620
The separations are
microelectron volts,

00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:30.880
but they are discrete.

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:34.020
You can count them.

00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:39.370
And then with this
state over here,

00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:42.130
we think of counting them.

00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:45.760
And you say, well, I
can count them with n.

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:54.270
So if I imagine the
k line from 0 to 50,

00:08:54.270 --> 00:09:02.200
the other states are
over, all the values of k.

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:04.060
And they could say,
well, I even want

00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:08.180
to see how many states there
are in a little element dk.

00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:16.595
And for the that you
would have that dk taken

00:09:16.595 --> 00:09:22.350
a differential here
is dn times pi.

00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:28.170
So of the number of states
that there are in dk, dn--

00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:29.660
let me right here--

00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:42.440
dn equals l over pi dk is
the number of positive energy

00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:46.940
states in dk.

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:55.170
In the range dk, in
the range of momentum,

00:09:55.170 --> 00:10:00.450
dk that little interval, there
are that many positive energy

00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:01.622
eigenstates.

00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:08.130
So far, so good.

00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:26.590
So now let's consider
the real case.

00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:31.180
Repeat for the case
there is some potential.

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:41.030
Well, you would say, well,
I don't know how to count.

00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:44.870
I have to solve the problem
of when the potential makes

00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:45.620
a difference.

00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:48.770
But no, you do
know how to count.

00:10:48.770 --> 00:10:57.240
So repeat for V
different from 0.

00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:01.680
This time we have a
solution for x greater

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:04.090
than R. We know the solution.

00:11:04.090 --> 00:11:08.220
This is our universal
solution with the phase.

00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:14.610
So there you have the si
effect is e to i delta sine

00:11:14.610 --> 00:11:19.980
kx plus delta of k.

00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:20.775
That's a solution.

00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:27.200
Yes, you have the
solution always.

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:29.840
You just don't
know what delta is.

00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:32.390
But you don't know what delta--

00:11:32.390 --> 00:11:35.870
you don't need to know what
delta is to prove the theorem,

00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:38.700
You just need to
know it's there.

00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:41.580
So here it goes.

00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:45.680
And this time the wall will
also do the same thing.

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:54.380
We'll demand the si of x
vanishes for x equal L.

00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:58.952
So this time we get that kx--

00:11:58.952 --> 00:12:07.900
no kL plus delta of k is
equal to some other number n

00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:14.750
prime times pi multiple of pi.

00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:22.570
This phase-- this total phase
has to be a multiple of pi.

00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:24.320
And what is n prime?

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:25.850
I don't know what is n prime?

00:12:25.850 --> 00:12:27.530
It is some integers.

00:12:27.530 --> 00:12:32.390
I don't know whether it starts
from 1, 2, 3 or from 100

00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:34.230
or whatever.

00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:38.000
The only thing we
care is that, again,

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.890
taking a little
differential, you

00:12:39.890 --> 00:12:46.960
have dk times L
plus d delta, dk,

00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:52.340
times dk is equal to
the dn prime times pi.

00:12:55.650 --> 00:13:01.050
We take an infinitesimal version
of this equation, which again

00:13:01.050 --> 00:13:05.580
tells me how many positive--
all these states are

00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:07.830
positive energy states.

00:13:07.830 --> 00:13:09.510
They have k.

00:13:09.510 --> 00:13:16.310
So all these are
positive energy states.

00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:28.310
So from this equation, we get
that dn prime is equal to L

00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:46.320
over pi dk plus 1 over pi
d delta dk times dk, which

00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:53.880
gives me if I know the dk,
again, the number of states

00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:58.500
that you have in
that range of k,

00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:00.750
You see it's like
momentum is now quantized.

00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:03.070
So for any little
range of momentum,

00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:05.250
you can tell how many
states there are.

00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:11.250
And here it is how many states
there are, positive energy

00:14:11.250 --> 00:14:14.580
states, positive.

00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:33.210
This is the number of positive
energy states in dk with V

00:14:33.210 --> 00:14:39.530
different from 0, here
is with V equal 0.

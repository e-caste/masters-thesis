00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:03.980
PROFESSOR: We have two
equations now relating

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:06.680
this number of states.

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:13.300
And now you can say, oh,
OK, so I look at the k line.

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.470
And I look at the
little piece of the k

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:17.600
and say, oh, how many
states were there

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.470
with 0 potential, some
number, first blackboard.

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.010
How many states are there
now with some potential,

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:26.760
some other number?

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.230
It has changed.

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.890
For every-- because these two
equations, the n for equal dk,

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:36.710
the n is not equal
to the dn prime.

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:41.660
In one case, the energy
levels or the momentum levels

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.930
are more compressed
or more separated,

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.920
but whatever it is,
whatever the sign is,

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.500
there is a little discrepancy.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.490
So both of them are
giving me the total number

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:59.920
of positive energy
states in the little dk.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.650
Case So if I take
the difference,

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:05.470
I will get some information.

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.260
So I would say the
following, if I

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:13.930
want to calculate the number
of positive energy solutions

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:18.550
and now I think the following,
I take the potential V equals 0

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:23.710
and slowly but surely deepen
it, push it, and do things

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:31.750
and create the potential V of
x slowly, slow the formation.

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:38.170
In this process, I can look
at a little interval dk

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:44.780
and tell how many states are
positive energy states I lost.

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:51.460
So if, for example, dn is
bigger than dn prime, dn equal 5

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:56.020
and dn prime is equal to 3, I
started with 5 positive energy

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.020
states in this little
interval and by the time

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.140
I change the potential
I ended up with 3.

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:03.730
So I lost 2.

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:14.740
So let me write here the
number of positive energy

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:29.420
solutions lost in
the interval dk

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:46.690
as the potential is turned
on is dn the original number

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.990
minus the dn prime.

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.690
If that's positive,
I've lost state.

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:01.340
If it's negative, I gained
state, positive energy states.

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.570
In this number, we can
calculate the difference.

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:16.290
This is minus 1 over
pi d delta dk dk.

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:17.467
I'll put it here.

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:39.650
We'll we're not far.

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:41.690
We'll this is what you lost.

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:43.910
The number of positive
energy eigenstates

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:46.580
that you lost in little dk.

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:51.950
To see how many positive energy
states you lost over all,

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:55.460
you must integrate over all
the dk's and see how much

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:58.010
you lost in every little piece.

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:14.470
So the number of positive energy
solutions lost, not in the dk,

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:26.210
but lost as the
potential is turned on

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:35.940
is equal to the integral over
k from 0 to infinity of minus 1

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:45.700
over pi d delta dk is in
the way of that expression

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:49.370
of that right coincide.

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:53.300
But this is a total derivative.

00:04:53.300 --> 00:05:02.280
So this is minus 1 over
pi delta of k evaluated

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:05.490
between infinity and 0.

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:11.580
And therefore, the number
of states lost is 1 over pi,

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:17.170
because of the sign down to
0 minus delta of infinity.

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:28.150
So we're almost there.

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:34.410
This is the number of positive
energy solutions lost.

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:39.210
Now I want to emphasize that the
situation is quite interesting.

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:41.250
Let me make a
little drawing here.

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:55.700
So suppose here
is the case where

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:58.070
you have the
potential equal to 0

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:01.820
and here is energy equal to 0.

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:03.800
Then you have all these states.

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:15.780
Now even though
we've put the wall,

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:18.870
the wall allows us
to count the states,

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:21.790
but there are still going to be
an infinite number of states.

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:26.920
The infinite square wall has
an infinite number of states.

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:36.620
So that thing really continues,
but what happens by the time v

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:39.200
is deferred from 0?

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:45.288
Here is that the E
equals 0 line and here is

00:06:45.288 --> 00:06:48.510
the E equals 0 line.

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:51.910
As we've discussed,
as you change

00:06:51.910 --> 00:07:00.180
the potential slowly, this
are going to shift a little

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:03.160
and some are going
to go down here,

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:06.130
are going to become
bound states.

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:15.912
They're going to be a number of
bound states, N bound states,

00:07:15.912 --> 00:07:21.370
number of bound states
equal N. And then

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:24.400
there's going to be
still sub states here

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:26.860
that's also go to infinity.

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:38.210
So you cannot quite
say so easily, well,

00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:42.380
the number of states here minus
the number of states here is

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:43.970
the number lost.

00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:47.020
That's not true, because that's
infinite, that's infinite,

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:50.000
and subtracting infinity is bad.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:56.420
But you know that you've lost
a number of finite number

00:07:56.420 --> 00:08:00.830
of positive energy solutions.

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:06.710
So as you track here, the
number of states must--

00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:11.140
the states must go
into each other.

00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:15.880
And therefore, if these
four states are now here,

00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:20.140
before they were here, and
those were the positive energy

00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:24.370
solutions that were lost,
in going from here to here,

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:32.650
you lost positive
energy solutions.

00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:37.270
You lost a finite number of
positive energy solutions.

00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:39.610
Even though there's infinite
here and infinite here,

00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:40.820
you lost some.

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:43.960
And you did that by
keeping track at any place

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:47.140
how much you lost.

00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:51.700
And therefore the states
lost are never really lost.

00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:56.440
They are the ones that
became the band states here.

00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:59.380
So the positive energy
states that got lost

00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:00.700
are the bound states.

00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:05.260
So the number bound states
is equal to the number

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:08.230
of positive energy
solutions, because there

00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:09.550
are no lost states.

00:09:09.550 --> 00:09:14.800
So this is equal to a
number of bound states,

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:27.990
because there are
overall no lost states.

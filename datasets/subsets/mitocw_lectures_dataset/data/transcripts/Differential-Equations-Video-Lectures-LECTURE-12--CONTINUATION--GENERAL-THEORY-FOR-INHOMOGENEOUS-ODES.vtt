WEBVTT

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
We are going to start today in
a serious way on the

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
inhomogenous equation,
second-order linear

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
differential,
I'll simply write it out

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
instead of writing out all the
words which go with it.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
So, such an equation looks
like, the second-order equation

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000
is going to look like y double
prime plus p of x,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000
t, x plus q of x times y.
Now, up to now the right-hand

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000
side has been zero.
So, now we are going to make it

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000
not be zero.
So, this is going to be f of x.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000
In the most frequent

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000
applications,
x is time.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.000
x is usually time,
often, but not always.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.000
So, maybe just for today,
I will use X in talking about

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.000
the general theory.
And, from now on,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000
I'll probably make X equal time
because that's what is most of

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.000
the time in the applications.
So, this is the part we've been

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.000
studying up until now.
It has a lot of names.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.000
It's input, signal,
commas between those,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.000
a driving term,
or sometimes it's called the

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.000
forcing term.
You'll see all of these in the

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.000
literature, and it pretty much
depends upon what course you're

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.000
sitting at, what the professor
habitually calls it.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.000
I will try to use all these
terms now and then,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.000
probably most often I will
lapse into input as the most

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.000
generic term,
suggesting nothing in

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.000
particular, and therefore,
equally acceptable or

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.000
unacceptable to everybody.
The response,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.000
the solution,
then, the solution as you know

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:21.000
is then called the response.
The response,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.000
sometimes it's called the
output.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.000
I think I'll stick pretty much
with response.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.000
So, I'm using pretty much the
same terminology we use for

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:41.000
studying first-order equations.
Now, as you will see,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.000
the reason we had to study the
homogeneous case first was

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:51.000
because you cannot solve this
without knowing the homogeneous

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.000
solutions.
So, that's the inhomogeneous

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.000
case.
But the homogeneous one,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:02.000
the corresponding homogeneous
thing, y double prime plus p of

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:07.000
x y prime plus q of x times y
equals zero

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.000
is an essential
part of the solution to this

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.000
equation.
That's called,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.000
therefore, it has names.
Now, unfortunately,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:25.000
it doesn't have a single name.
I don't know what to call it,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:30.000
but I think I'll probably call
it the associated homogeneous

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.000
equation, or ODE,
the associated homogeneous

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:40.000
equation, the one associated to
the guy on the left.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:46.000
It's also called the reduced
equation by some people.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:50.000
There is some other term for
it, which escapes me totally,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.000
but what the heck.
Now, its solution has a name.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.000
So, its solution,
of course, doesn't depend on

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:01.000
anything in particular,
the general solution,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:04.000
because the right-hand side is
always zero.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:09.000
So, its solution,
we know can be written as y

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.000
equals in the form c1 y1 plus c2
y2,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:16.000
where y1 and y2 are any two
independent solutions of that,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:20.000
and then c1's and c2's are
arbitrary constants.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:23.000
Now, what you are looking at
this equation,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:26.000
you're going to need this also.
And therefore,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:30.000
it has a name.
It has various names.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:32.000
Sometimes there is a subscript,
c, there.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:37.000
Sometimes there's a subscript,
h.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Sometimes there's no subscript
at all, which is the most

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:45.000
confusing of all.
But, anyway,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:48.000
what's the name given to it?
Well, there is no name.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:53.000
Many books call it the solution
to the associated homogeneous

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:59.000
equation.
That's maximally long.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:02.000
Your book calls it the
complementary solution.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:08.000
Many people call it that,
and many will look at you with

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:12.000
a blank, who know differential
equations very well,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:16.000
and will not have the faintest
idea what you're talking about.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:20.000
If you call it (y)h,
then you are thinking of it as

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:24.000
the solution;
the h is for homogeneous to

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:27.000
indicate it's the solution.
So, it's the solution to the,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:32.000
I'm not going to write that.
You put it in her books if you

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:36.000
like writing.
Write solution to the

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:39.000
associated homogeneous equation,
y(h).

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:42.000
But, it's all the same thing.
Now, or the solution to the

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:47.000
reduced equation,
I see I have in my notes.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:51.000
Okay, good, the solution to the
reduced equation,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:54.000
too.
Okay, now, the examples,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:56.000
there are, of course,
two classical examples,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:59.000
of which you know one.
But, use them as the model for

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:03.000
what solutions of these things
should look like and how they

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:08.000
should behave.
So, the model you know already

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:12.000
is the one, I won't make the
leading coefficient one because

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:17.000
it usually isn't,
is the one, m x double prime,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:21.000
so t is the
independent variable,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:24.000
plus b x prime plus k x equals
f of t.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:29.000
That's the spring-mass system,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:32.000
the spring-mass-dashpot system.
Mass, the damping constant and

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:38.000
the spring constant,
except up to now,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:41.000
it's always been zero here.
What does this f of t

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:46.000
represent?
Well, if you think of the way

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:49.000
in which I derived the equation,
the mx, that was the Newton's

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:55.000
law.
That's the acceleration.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:57.000
So, it's the acceleration,
the mass times the

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:01.000
acceleration.
By Newton's law,

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:03.000
this is equal to the imposed
force on the little mass truck.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:10.000
Okay, you got that truck,
there.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:12.000
I'm not going to draw the truck
for the nth time.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:15.000
You'll have to imagine it.
So, here's our truck.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:19.000
Okay, forces are acting on it.
Remember, the forces were

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:23.000
minus kx.
That came from the spring.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:26.000
There was a force,
minus b x prime.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:29.000
That came from the dashpot,
the damping force.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:32.000
So, this other guy is f of t.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:36.000
What's this?
This is the external force,

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:38.000
which is acting out.
In other words,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:40.000
instead of the little truck
going back and forth and doing

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:44.000
its own thing all by itself,
here's someone with an

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:47.000
electromagnet,
and the mass it's carrying is a

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:50.000
big pile of iron ore.
You're turning it on and off,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:53.000
and pulling that thing from
afar where nobody can see it.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:57.000
So, this is the external force.
Now, think, that is the model

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:01.000
you must have in your mind of
how these equations are treated.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:06.000
In other words,
when f of t is zero,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:09.000
the system is passive.
There is no external force on

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:13.000
it when this is zero.
The system is sitting,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:16.000
and just doing what it wants to
do, all by itself.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:20.000
You wanted up by giving it an
initial push,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:23.000
and putting its initial
position somewhere.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:26.000
But after that,
you lay your hands off.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:29.000
The system then just passively
responds to its initial

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:33.000
conditions and does what it
wants.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:37.000
The other model is that you
don't let it respond the way it

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:41.000
wants to.
You force it from the outside

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:43.000
by pushing it with an external
force.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:46.000
Now, those are clearly two
entirely different problems:

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:50.000
what it does by itself,
or what it does when it's acted

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:54.000
on from outside.
And, when I explained to you

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:57.000
how the thing is to be solved,
you have to keep in mind those

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:01.000
two models.
So, this is the forced system.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:06.000
I'll just use the word,
forced system,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:08.000
that's where f of t is
not zero, versus the passive

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:13.000
system where there is no
external applied force.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:17.000
The passive system,
the forced system,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:20.000
now, you have to both,
even if you wanted to solve the

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:24.000
forced system,
the way the system would behave

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:28.000
if nothing would be done to it
from the outside is nonetheless

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:33.000
going to be an important part of
the solution.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:38.000
And, I won't be able to give
you that solution without

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:41.000
knowing this also.
Now, I'd like to give you the

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:44.000
other model very rapidly because
it's in your book.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:48.000
It's in the problems I have to
give you.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:51.000
You know, it's part of
everybody's culture,

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:54.000
whether they like it or not.
So, that's example number one.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:58.000
Example number two,
which follows the differential

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:01.000
equation just as perfectly as
the spring-mass-dashpot system

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:05.000
is the simple electric circuit.
The inductance,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:10.000
you don't know yet what an
inductance is,

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:14.000
officially, but you will,
a resistance,

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:17.000
sorry, that's okay,
put the capacitance up there,

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:21.000
resistance, and then maybe a
thing.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:24.000
So, this is a resistance.
I think you know these symbols.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:30.000
By now, you certainly know the
system for capacitance.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:34.000
What I mean when I say C is the
capacitance, you may not know

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:40.000
yet what L is.
That's called the inductance.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:45.000
So, this is something called a
coil because it looks like one.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:49.000
L is what's called its
inductance.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:51.000
And, the differential equation,
there are two differential

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:56.000
equations which can be used in
this.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:58.000
They are essentially the same.
One is simply the derivative of

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:02.000
the other.
Both differential equations

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:05.000
come from Kirchhoff's voltage
law, that the sum of the voltage

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:10.000
drops as you move around the
circuit --

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:14.000
-- has to be zero because
otherwise, I don't have to,

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:17.000
that's because of somebody's
law, Kirchhoff,

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:20.000
with two h's.
The sum of the voltage drops to

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:23.000
zero, and now you know the
voltage drop across this,

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:27.000
and you know the voltage drop
across that because you learned

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:31.000
in 8.02.
You will, one day,

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:33.000
learn the voltage drop across
this.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:35.000
But, I already know it.
It's Li.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:38.000
So, i is the current.
I'll write this thing in its

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:43.000
primitive form first.
So, i is the current that's

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:48.000
flowing in the circuit.
q is the charge on the

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:53.000
capacitance.
So, the voltage drop across the

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:57.000
coil is L times i.
The voltage shop across the,

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:03.000
Li prime,
the voltage drop across the

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:08.000
resistance is,
well, you know that.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:13.000
And, the voltage shop across
the capacitance is q

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:16.000
divided by C.
And so, that's equal to,

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:19.000
well, it's equal to zero,
except if there's a battery

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:22.000
here or something generating a
voltage drop,

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:25.000
so, let's call that E is a
generic word.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:27.000
E could be a battery.
It could be a source of

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:30.000
alternating current,
something like that.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:33.000
But, there's a voltage drop
across it, and I'm giving E the

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:37.000
name of the voltage drop.
So, and then there's the

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:41.000
question of the signs,
which I know I'll never

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:44.000
understand.
But, let's assume you've chosen

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:47.000
the sign convention so that this
comes out nicely on the

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:50.000
right-hand side.
So, this might be varying

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:53.000
sinusoidally,
in which case you'd have source

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:56.000
of alternating current.
Or, it might be constant,

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:59.000
in which that would be a
battery, a little dry cell

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:02.000
giving you direct current of a
constant voltage,

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:05.000
stuff like that.
So, you could make this minus

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:09.000
if you want, but everything will
have the wrong signs,

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:13.000
so don't do it.
Now, this doesn't look like

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:15.000
what it's supposed to look like
because it's got q and i.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:19.000
So, the final thing you have to
know is that q prime is

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:23.000
equal to i.
The rate at which that charge

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:25.000
leaves the condenser and hurries
around the circuit to find its

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:29.000
little soul mate on the other
side is the current that's

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:33.000
flowing in the circuit.
That's why current flows,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:36.000
except nothing really happens.
Electrons just push on each

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:41.000
other, and they stay where they
are.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:43.000
I don't understand this at all.
So, if I differentiate this,

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:48.000
you can do two things.
Either you could integrate i,

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:52.000
and expressed the thing
entirely in terms of q,

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:56.000
or you can differentiate it,
and express everything in terms

00:13:54.000 --> 00:14:00.000
of i.
Your book does nicely both,

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:03.000
does not take sides.
So, let's differentiate it,

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:08.000
and then it will look like L i
double prime plus R i prime plus

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:12.000
i divided by C equals,

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:15.000
and now, watch out,
you have now not the

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:18.000
electromotive force,
but its derivative.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:21.000
So, if you were so unfortunate
as to put a little dry cell

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:25.000
there, now you've got nothing,
and you've got the homogeneous

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:30.000
case.
That's okay.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:31.000
Where are the erasers?
One eraser?

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:34.000
I don't believe this.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:49.000
So, there's the equation.
There are our two equations.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:53.000
Why don't we put them up in
colored chalk.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:56.000
There's the spring equation.
And, here's the equation that

00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:00.000
governs the current,
for how the current flows in

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:04.000
that circuit.
And now, you can see,

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:07.000
again, what does it mean?
If this is zero,

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:10.000
for example,
if I have a dry cell there,

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:13.000
or if I have nothing at all in
the circuit, then this

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:17.000
represents the passive circuit.
It's just sitting there.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:22.000
It wouldn't do anything at all,
except that you've put a charge

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:26.000
on the capacitor,
and waited, and of course,

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:28.000
when you put a charge on there,
it's got a discharge,

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:32.000
and discharges through the
circuit, and swings back and

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:35.000
forth a little bit if it's
under-damped until finally

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:38.000
towards the end the current dies
away to zero.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:42.000
But, what usually happens is
that you drive this passive

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:45.000
circuit by putting an effective
E in it, and then you want to

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:50.000
know how the current behaves.
So, those are the two problems,

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:54.000
the passive circuit without an
applied electromotive force,

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:58.000
or plugging it into the wall,
and wanting it to do things.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:02.000
That's the normal state of
affairs.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:06.000
People don't want passive
circuits, they want circuits

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:09.000
which do things because,
okay, that's why they want to

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:13.000
solve inhomogeneous equations
instead of homogeneous

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:17.000
equations.
But as I said,

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:19.000
you have to do the homogeneous
case first.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:22.000
Okay, you are now officially
responsible for this,

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:26.000
and I don't care that you
haven't had it in physics yet.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:30.000
You will before the next exam.
So, I don't even feel guilty.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:36.000
But, you're going to start
using it on the problem set

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:40.000
right away.
So, it's never too soon to

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:43.000
start learning it.
Okay, now, the main theorem,

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:47.000
I now want to go,
so that was just examples to

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:50.000
give you some physical feeling
for the sorts of differential

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:55.000
equations we'll be talking
about.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:58.000
I now want to tell you briefly
about the key theorem about

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:02.000
solving the homogeneous
equation.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:05.000
So, the main theorem about
solving the homogeneous equation

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:10.000
is, the inhomogeneous equation.
So, I'm going to write the

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:15.000
inhomogeneous equation out.
I'm going to make the left-hand

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:20.000
side a linear operator,
and am going to write the

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:24.000
equation as Ly equals f of x.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:27.000
That's the inhomogeneous
equation.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:29.000
So, L is the linear operator,
second order because I'm only

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:34.000
talking about second-order
equations.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:38.000
L is a linear operator,
and then this is the

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:43.000
differential equation.
So, here's our differential

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:49.000
equation.
It's inhomogeneous because it's

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:54.000
go the f of x on the
right hand side.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:59.000
And, what the theorem says is
that the solution has the

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:06.000
following form,
y sub p, I'll explain what that

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:11.000
is in just a moment,
plus y sub c.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:19.000
So, the hypothesis is we've got
the linear equation,

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:23.000
and the conclusion is that
that's what its solution looks

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:27.000
like.
Now, you already know what y

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:30.000
sub c looks like.
In other words,

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:33.000
if I write this out in more
detail, it would be i.e.,

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:37.000
department of fuller
explanation, --

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:41.000
-- the general solution looks
like y equals yp,

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:44.000
and then this thing is going to
look like an arbitrary constant

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:49.000
times y1 plus an arbitrary
constant times y2,

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:53.000
where these are solutions of
the homogeneous equation.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:57.000
So, Yc looks like this part,
and the yp, what's yp?

00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:01.000
p stands for particular,
the most confusing word in this

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:06.000
subject.
But, you've got at least four

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:10.000
weeks to learn what it means.
Okay, yp is a particular

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:16.000
solution to Ly equals f of x.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:20.000
Now, I'm not going to explain
what particular means.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:25.000
First, I'll chat as if you knew
what it meant,

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:30.000
and then we'll see if you have
picked it up.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:36.000
In other words,
the procedure for solving this

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:39.000
equation is composed of two
steps.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:42.000
First, to find this part.
In other words,

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:46.000
to find the complementary
solution, in other words,

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:50.000
to do what we've been doing for
the last week,

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:54.000
solve not the equation you are
given, but the reduced equation.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:59.000
So, the first step is to find
this.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:02.000
The second step is to find yp.
Now, what's yp?

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:07.000
yp is a particular solution to
the whole equation.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:11.000
Yeah, but which one?
Well, if it's any one,

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:15.000
then it's not a particular
solution, yeah.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:18.000
I say, unfortunately the word
particular here is not being

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:23.000
used in exactly the same sense
in which most people use it in

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:28.000
ordinary English.
It's a perfectly valid way to

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:32.000
use it.
It's just confusing,

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:35.000
and no one has ever come up
with a better word.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:39.000
So, particular means any one
solution.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:44.000
Any one will do.
Okay, even these have slightly

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:51.000
different meanings.
Any questions about this?

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:57.000
I refuse to answer them.
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:04.000
Now, well, examples of course
will make it all clear.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:09.000
But I'd like,
first, to prove the theorem,

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:14.000
to show you how simple it is.
It's extremely simple if you

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:21.000
just use the fact that L is a
linear operator.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:26.000
We've got two things to prove.
What have we got to prove?

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:32.000
Well, I have to prove two
statements, first of all,

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:38.000
that all the yp plus c1 y1 plus
c2 y2 are

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:45.000
solutions.
How are we going to prove that?

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:49.000
Well, how do you know if
something is a solution?

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:52.000
Well, you plug it into the
equation, and you see if it

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:55.000
satisfies the equation.
Good, let's do it,

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:58.000
proof.
L, I'm going to plug it into

00:21:54.000 --> 00:22:00.000
the equation.
That means I calculate L of yp

00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:02.000
plus c1 y1 plus c2 y2.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:06.000
Now, what's the answer?
Because this is a linear

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:10.000
operator, and notice,
the argument doesn't use the

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:14.000
fact that the equation is second
order.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:18.000
It immediately generalizes to a
linear equation of any order,

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:23.000
whatever-- 47.
Okay, this is L of yp plus L of

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:27.000
c1 y1 plus c2 y2.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:31.000
Well, what's that?
What's L of the complementary

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:35.000
solution?
What does it mean to be the

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:40.000
complementary solution?
It means when you apply the

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:43.000
operator L to it,
you get zero because this

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:46.000
satisfies the homogeneous
equation.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:49.000
So, this is zero.
What's L of yp?

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:52.000
Well, it was a particular
solution to the equation.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:56.000
Therefore, when I plugged it
into the equation,

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:59.000
I must have gotten out on the
right-hand side,

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:03.000
f of x.
So, this is since yp is a

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:06.000
solution to the whole equation.
So, what's the conclusion?

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:12.000
That, if I take any one of
these guys, no matter what c1

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:16.000
and c2 are, apply the linear
operator, L to it,

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:19.000
the answer comes out
to be f of.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:23.000
Therefore, this proves that
this shows that these are all

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:27.000
solutions because that's what it
means.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:30.000
Therefore, they satisfy L of y
equals f of x.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:36.000
They satisfy the whole
inhomogeneous differential

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:40.000
equation, and that's it.
Well, that's only half the

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:44.000
story.
The other half of the story is

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:47.000
to show that there are no other
solutions.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:51.000
Okay, so we got our little u of
x coming up again,

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:56.000
and he thinks he's a solution.
Okay, so, to prove there are no

00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:01.000
other solutions,
it almost sounds biblical,

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:05.000
thou shalt have no other
solutions before me,

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:09.000
okay.
There are no other solutions

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:13.000
accept these guys for different
values of c1 and c2.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:16.000
Okay, so, u of x is a
solution.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:19.000
I have to show that u of x is
one of these guys.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:22.000
How am I going to do that?
Easy.

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:25.000
If it's a solution that,
L of u,

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:27.000
okay, I'm going to drop the x,
okay, just to make the,

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:31.000
like I dropped the x over
there.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:35.000
If it's a solution to the whole
inhomogeneous equation,

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:39.000
then this must come out to be f
of x.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:43.000
Now, what's L of yp?
That's f of x too,

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:47.000
by secret little particular
solution I've got in my pocket.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:53.000
Okay, I pull it out,
ah-ha, L of yp,

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:56.000
that's f of x,
too.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:57.000
Now, I'm going to not add them.
I'm going to subtract them.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:02.000
What is L of u minus yp?

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:06.000
Well, it's zero.
It's zero because this is a

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:11.000
linear operator.
This would be L of u minus L of

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:14.000
yp.
I guess the answer is zero on

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:18.000
the right-hand side.
And therefore,

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:20.000
what is the conclusion?
If that's zero,

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:23.000
it must be a solution to the
homogeneous equation.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:27.000
Therefore, u minus yp
is equal to,

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:30.000
there must be c1 and c2.
I won't give them the generic

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:34.000
names.
I'll give them a name,

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:36.000
a particular one.
I'll put a tilde to indicate

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:40.000
it's a particular one.
c1 plus c2 y2 tilde,

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:43.000
so, in other words,
for some choice of these

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:47.000
constants, and I'll call those
particular choices c1 tilde and

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:51.000
c2 tilde, it must be that these
are equal.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:54.000
Well, what does that say?
It says that u is equal to yp

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:58.000
plus c1 tilde,
blah, blah, blah,

00:25:54.000 --> 00:26:00.000
blah, plus c2 tilde,
blah, blah, blah,

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:03.000
blah, and therefore chose that
u wasn't a new solution.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:08.000
It was one of these.
So, u isn't new.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:14.000
So, I should write it down.
Otherwise some of you will have

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:24.000
missed the punch line.
Okay, therefore,

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:31.000
u is equal to yp plus c1 tilde
y1 plus c2 tilde y2.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:42.000
And, it shows.
This guy who thought he was new

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:45.000
was not new at all.
It was just one of the other

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:49.000
solutions.
Okay, well, now,

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:51.000
since the coefficient's a
constant, apparently we've done

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:55.000
half the work.
We know what the complementary

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:58.000
solution is because you know how
to do those in terms of

00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:02.000
exponentials and complex
exponentials,

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:05.000
signs and cosines,
and so on.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:09.000
So, what's left to do?
All we have to do is find to

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:13.000
solve equations,
which are inhomogeneous.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:16.000
All we have to do is find a
particular solution,

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:20.000
find one solution.
It doesn't matter which one,

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:24.000
any one.
Just find one,

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:26.000
okay?
Now, we're going to spend the

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:29.000
next two weeks trying to do
this.

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:32.000
I'll give you various methods.
I'll give you a general method

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:38.000
involving Fourier series because
it's a good excuse for learning

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:43.000
what Fourier series are.
But, the answer is that in

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:47.000
general, for a few standard
functions, it's known how to do

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:51.000
this.
You will learn those methods

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:54.000
for finding those using
operators.

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:56.000
For all the others,
it's done by a series,

00:27:54.000 --> 00:28:00.000
or a method involving
approximation.

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:04.000
Or, the worse comes to worst,
you throw it on a computer and

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:08.000
just take a graph and the
numerical output of answers as

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:13.000
the particular solution.
Okay, now before,

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:16.000
we are going to start that
work, not today.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:20.000
We'll start it next Monday,
and it will last,

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:24.000
as I say the next two weeks.
And, we will be up to spring

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:28.000
break.
But, before we do that,

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:31.000
I'd like to relate this to what
we did for first order equations

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:36.000
because there is something to be
learned from that.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:42.000
Think back to the linear
first-order equation,

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:44.000
and I'm going to,
since from now on for the rest

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:47.000
of the period,
I'm going to be considering the

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:50.000
case for constant coefficients.
In other words,

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:53.000
this case of springs or
circuits or simple systems which

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:57.000
behave like those and have
constant coefficients.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:29:00.000
So, for the linear,
first-order equation,

00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:02.000
there, too, I'm going to think
of constant coefficients.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:07.000
We talked quite a bit about
this equation.

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:10.000
What did I call the right-hand
side?

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:12.000
I think we usually called it q
of t,

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:15.000
right?
This is in ancient history.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:18.000
The definition of ancient
history was before the first

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:22.000
exam.
Okay, now how does that fit

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:24.000
into this theorem that I've
given you?

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:27.000
Remember what the solution
looked like.

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:31.000
The solution looked like,
remember, you took the

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:34.000
integrating factor was e to the
kt,

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:38.000
and then after you integrated
both sides, multiplied through,

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:43.000
and then the final answer
looked like this,

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:47.000
y equaled, it was e to the
negative kt times

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:51.000
either an indefinite integral,
or a definite integral

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:56.000
depending on your preference,
q of t,

00:29:54.000 --> 00:30:00.000
so, x is metamorphosed into t.
I gather you've got that,

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:04.000
e to the kt plus,
what was the other term?

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:08.000
A constant times e to the
negative kt

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:14.000
How does this fit into the
paradigm I've given you over

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:18.000
there for solving the second
order equation?

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:21.000
Which term is which?
Well, this has the arbitrary

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:25.000
constant in it.
So, this must be the

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:28.000
complementary solution.
Is it?

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:30.000
Is this the solution to the
associated homogeneous equation?

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:36.000
What's the associated
homogeneous equation?

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:38.000
Put zero here.
Okay, if you put zero there,

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:41.000
what's the solution?
Now, this you ought to know.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:44.000
y prime equals negative ky.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:46.000
What's the solution?
e to the negative kt.

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:49.000
You are supposed to come into

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:52.000
this course knowing that,
except there's an arbitrary

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:55.000
constant in front.
So, right, this is exactly the

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:58.000
solution to the associated
homogeneous equation,

00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:01.000
where there is zero here.
Then, what's this thing?

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:06.000
This is a particular solution.
This is my yp.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:08.000
But that's not a particular
solution because this indefinite

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:12.000
integral, you know,
has an arbitrary constant in

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:15.000
it.
In fact, it's just that

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:16.000
arbitrary constant.
So, it's totally confusing.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:19.000
But, this symbol,
you know when you actually

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:22.000
solve the equation this way,
all you did was you found one

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:26.000
function here.
You didn't throw in the

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:28.000
arbitrary constant right away.
All you needed to do was find

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:32.000
one function.
And, even if you really are

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:35.000
bothered by the fact that this
is so indefinite,

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:38.000
and therefore,
make it a particular solution

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:41.000
by making this zero,
make it a definite integral,

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:44.000
zero, here, t there,
and then change those t's to

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:48.000
dummy t's, t1's or t tildes,
or something like that.

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:51.000
So, this fits into that thing.
In other words,

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:54.000
I could have done it at that
time, but I didn't the point

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:58.000
because this can be solved
directly, whereas,

00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:01.000
of course, the general second
order equation in homogeneous

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:04.000
cannot be solved directly,
and therefore you have to be

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:08.000
willing to talk about what its
solutions look like in advance.

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:14.000
Now, remember I said,
we talked, I said there was two

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:18.000
different cases,
although both of them had the

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:21.000
identical looking solution.
Their meaning in the physical

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:25.000
world was so different that they
really should be considered as

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:30.000
solving the same equation.
And, one of these was the case.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:36.000
Of the two, perhaps the more
important was the case when k

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:40.000
was positive,
and of course the other is when

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:44.000
k is negative.
When k is positive,

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:47.000
that had the effect of
separating that solution into

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:51.000
this part, which was a
transient, and the other part,

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:55.000
which was a steady state.
The steady state solution,

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:59.000
that was the yp part of it in
that terminology.

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:03.000
And, the transient part,
it was trangent because it went

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:08.000
to zero.
If k is positive,

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:11.000
the exponential dies regardless
of what c is.

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:15.000
So, the transient,
that's the yc part.

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:18.000
It goes to zero as Ttgoes to
infinity.

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:22.000
The transient depends on,
uses, the initial condition,

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:27.000
whatever it is,
because that's what determines

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:31.000
the value of c.
On the other hand,

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:34.000
this initial condition makes no
difference as t goes towards

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:39.000
infinity.
All that's left is this steady

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:44.000
state solution.
And, all solutions tend to the

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:48.000
steady state solution.
So, if k is positive,

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:52.000
one gets this analysis of the
solutions into the sum of one

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:58.000
basic solution,
and the others,

00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:01.000
which just die away,
have no influence on this,

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:05.000
less and less influence as time
goes to infinity.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:11.000
For k less than zero,
this analysis does not work

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:15.000
because this term,
if k is less than zero,

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:18.000
this term goes to infinity or
negative infinity,

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:22.000
and typically tends to dominate
that.

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:25.000
So, it's the start that the
important one.

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:29.000
It depends on the initial
conditions, and the analysis is

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:34.000
meaningless.
So, the above is meaningless.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:39.000
And now, what I'd like to do is
try to see what the analog of

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:45.000
that is for second order
equations, and higher order

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:51.000
equations.
If you understand second-order,

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:55.000
that's good enough.
Higher order goes exactly the

00:34:54.000 --> 00:35:00.000
same way.
So, the question is,

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:04.000
for second-order,
let's make it with constant

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:08.000
coefficients plus,
I could call it b and k,

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:13.000
oh, no, b k,
or p.

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:17.000
The trouble is,
that wouldn't take care of the

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:20.000
electrical circuits.
So, I just want to use neutral

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:23.000
letters, which suggest nothing.
And, you can make them turn it

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:28.000
into a circuit,
so springs, or yet other

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:31.000
examples undreamt of.
But these are constants.

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:34.000
And I'm going to think of it as
time.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:38.000
I think I'll switch back to
time, let x be the time.

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:43.000
So, B y equals f of t.
So, there is our equation.

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:49.000
A and B are constants.
And, the question is,

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:53.000
the question I'm asking,
can think of either of these

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:59.000
two models or others,
the question I'm asking is,

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:04.000
under what circumstances can I
make that same type of analysis

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:10.000
into steady-state and transient?
Well, what does the solution

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:17.000
look like?
The solution looks like y

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:21.000
equals a particular solution
plus c1 y1 plus c2 y2.

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:26.000
Therefore, to make that look

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:30.000
like this, the c1 and c2 contain
the initial conditions.

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:37.000
This part does not.
Therefore, if I want to say

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:41.000
that the solutions look like a
steady state solution plus

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:47.000
something that dies away,
which becomes less and less

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:53.000
important as time goes on,
what I'm really asking is,

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:58.000
under what circumstances is
this part guaranteed to go to

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:04.000
zero?
So, the question is,

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:07.000
when, in other words,
under what conditions on the

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:12.000
equation A and B,
in effect, is what we are

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:16.000
asking.
When does c1 y1 plus c2 y2 go

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:20.000
to zero as t goes to infinity,

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:25.000
regardless of what
c1 and c2 are for all c1 c2.

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:31.000
Now, here there was no
difficulty.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:36.000
We had the thing very
explicitly, and you could see k

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:40.000
is positive: this goes to zero.
And if k is negative,

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:44.000
it doesn't go to zero.
It goes to infinity.

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:47.000
Here, I want to make the same
kind of analysis,

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:50.000
except it's just going to take,
it's a little more trouble.

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:55.000
But the answer,
when it finally comes out is

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:58.000
very beautiful.
So, when are all these guys

00:37:55.000 --> 00:38:01.000
going to go to zero?
First of all,

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:04.000
you might as well just have the
definition.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:07.000
So, all the good things that
this is going to imply,

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:11.000
if this is so,
in other words,

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:13.000
if they all go to zero,
everything in the complementary

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:18.000
solution, then the ODE is called
stable.

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:23.000
Some people call it
asymptotically stable.

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:27.000
I don't know what to call it.
I can make the analysis,

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:34.000
and then I use the identical
terminology, c1 y1 plus c2 y2.

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:42.000
This is called the transient
because it goes to zero.

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:46.000
This is called the particular
solution now that we labored so

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:51.000
hard to get for the next two
weeks.

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:53.000
It's the important part.
It's the steady-state part.

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:58.000
It's what lasts out to infinity
after the other stuff has

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:02.000
disappeared.
So, this is the steady-state

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:05.000
solution, steady-state solution,
okay?

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:10.000
And, the differential equation
is called stable.

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:13.000
Now, it's of the highest
interest to know when a

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:16.000
differential equation is stable,
linear differential equation is

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:20.000
stable in this sense because you
have a control.

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:23.000
You know what its solutions
look like.

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:26.000
You have some feeling for how
it's behaving in the long term.

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:30.000
If this is not so,
each equation is a law unto

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:33.000
itself if you don't know.
So, let's do the work.

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:37.000
For the rest of the period,
what I'd like to do is to find

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:42.000
out what the conditions are,
which make this true.

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:46.000
Those were the equations which
we will have a right to call

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:51.000
stable.
So, when does this happen,

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:54.000
and where is it going to
happen?

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:56.000
I don't know.
I guess, here.

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:11.000
Now, I think the first step is
fairly easy, and it will give

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:16.000
you a good review of what we've
been doing up until now.

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:20.000
So, I'm simply going to make a
case-by-case analysis.

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:25.000
Don't worry,
it won't take very long.

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:28.000
What are the cases we've been
studying?

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:31.000
Well, what do the
characteristic roots look like?

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:35.000
The roots of the characteristic
equation, in other words,

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:40.000
remember, there are cases.
The first case is they are real

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:47.000
and distinct,
r1 not equal to r2,

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:51.000
real and distinct.
What are the other cases?

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:56.000
Well, r1 equals r2.
And then, there's the case

00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:02.000
where there are complex.
So, I will write it r equals a

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:08.000
plus or minus b i.
What do the solutions look

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:13.000
like?
So, my ham-handed approach to

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:15.000
this problem is going to be,
in each case,

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:18.000
I'll look at the solutions,
and first get the condition on

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:22.000
the roots.
So, in other words,

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:24.000
I'm not going to worry right
away about the a and the b.

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:27.000
I'm going, instead,
to worry about expressing this

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:30.000
condition of stability in terms
of the characteristic roots.

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:34.000
In fact, that's the only way in
which many people know the

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:38.000
conditions.
You're going to be smarter.

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:41.000
Okay, what do the solutions
look like?

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:44.000
Well, the general solution
looks like e to the r1 t plus c2

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:48.000
e to the r2 t.

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:51.000
Okay, so, what's the stability
condition?

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:54.000
In other words,
if equation happened to have

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:57.000
its characteristic roots,
real and distinct,

00:41:54.000 --> 00:42:00.000
under what circumstances would
it be stable?

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:03.000
Would it, in other words,
all its solutions go to zero?

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:07.000
So, I'm talking about the
homogeneous equation,

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:10.000
the reduced equation,
the associated homogeneous

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:13.000
equation.
Why?

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:16.000
Because that's all that's
involved in this.

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:19.000
In other words,
when I write that,

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:21.000
I am no longer interested in
the whole equation.

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:25.000
All I'm interested in is the
reduced equation,

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:28.000
the equation where you turn the
f of t on the

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:32.000
right-hand side into zero.
So, what's the stability

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:37.000
condition?
Well, let's write it out.

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:41.000
Under what circumstances will
all these guys go to zero?

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:47.000
If r1 and r2 should be
negative, can they be zero?

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:52.000
No, because then it will be a
constant and it will go to zero.

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:58.000
How about this one?
Well, in this one,

00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:02.000
it's (c1 plus c2 times t)
multiplied by e to the r1 t.

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:07.000
Of course, both of these are

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:14.000
the same.
I'll just arbitrarily pick one

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:17.000
of them.
What happens to this as things

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:20.000
go to zero?
Well, this part is rising,

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:22.000
at least if c2 is positive.
This part is either helping or

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:27.000
it's hindering.
But, I hope you know what these

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:30.000
functions look like,
and you know which of them go

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:34.000
to zero.
They go to zero if r1 is

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:37.000
negative.
It might rise in the beginning,

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:41.000
but after a while they lose the
energy.

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:45.000
Of course, if r1 is equal to
zero, what do these guys do?

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:50.000
Linear, go to infinity.
Well, we are doing okay.

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:55.000
How about here?
Well, here, it's a little more

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:59.000
complicated.
The solutions look like e to

00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:03.000
the at times (c1 cosine bt plus
c2 sine bt).

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:09.000
Now, this part is a pure

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:13.000
oscillation.
You know that.

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:15.000
It might have a big amplitude,
but whatever it does,

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:19.000
it does the same thing all the
time.

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:22.000
So, whether this goes to zero
depends entirely upon what that

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:26.000
exponential is doing.
And, that exponential goes to

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:30.000
zero if a is negative.
So here, the condition is

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:34.000
negative.
And now, the only thing left to

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:39.000
do is to say it nicely.
I've got three cases,

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:44.000
and I want to say them all in
one breath.

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:49.000
So, the stability condition is,
the ODE is stable.

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:55.000
So, this is,
or f of t.

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:59.000
It doesn't matter.
But, psychologically,

00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:03.000
you can put this as zero there,
is stable if what?

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:11.000
In case one,
this is true.

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:13.000
In case two,
that's true.

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:16.000
In case three,
that's true.

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:19.000
But that's ugly.
Make it beautiful.

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:23.000
The beautiful way of saying it
is if all the characteristic

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:29.000
roots have negative real parts.
If the characteristic roots,

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:37.000
the r's or the a plus or minus
b i, have negative real part.

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:44.000
That's the form in which the
electrical engineers will nod

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:50.000
their head, tell you,
yeah, that's right,

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:55.000
negative real part,
sorry.

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:58.000
Isn't it right?
Is that right here?

00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:02.000
Yeah.
What's the real part of these

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:05.000
guys?
They themselves,

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:09.000
because they are real.
What's the real part of this?

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:15.000
Yeah.
The only case in which I really

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:19.000
had to use real part is when I
talk about the complex case

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:26.000
because a is just the real part
of a complex number.

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:32.000
It's not the whole thing.

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:05.750
We'd like to consider
torques on a body.

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:10.930
Let's draw an arbitrary body,
and let's consider a point s,

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:13.050
that we're about to
calculate the torque.

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:14.750
Now, we know that
forces on the body

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:17.180
can be both internal
and external.

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:19.700
And we'd like to show that
all internal torques will

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.140
cancel in pairs.

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.920
The way we'll do that is,
suppose we pick an object.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.930
We'll label it with mass
mi, and another object,

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:31.580
we'll label that with mass mj.

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:34.700
These are small mass
elements in the body.

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.410
And we'd like to know something
about the internal forces.

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.860
Now, let's make the assumption--
and this is the key property--

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.800
that the force due to
this interaction between j

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.355
and the i-th particle
pointing that way-- and here's

00:00:49.355 --> 00:00:54.660
the Newton's third law pair--
that these forces lie--

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.190
are directed along the line
connecting the two bodies.

00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:59.990
With this assumption,
we'll now show

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:03.890
that the torque due to these
two internal forces, [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.270
Newton's third law
pairs will cancel.

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.330
So let's calculate that out.

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:18.080
So we draw our vector from
rsi, and our other vector rsj.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.810
And now we're in position
to add these two torques.

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.400
So we have the torque
on s due to this pair is

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:33.650
equal to the sum of
rsi cross fji plus

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:40.700
rs-- that's an r-- make
sure we get that right.

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:47.479
We have rsj cross fij.

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:55.460
Now, the third law pair says
fji is equal to minus fiji.

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.200
And so, if we substitute-- let's
put the minus sign over here--

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:06.973
we get rsi minus rsj cross fji.

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.060
Now, let's look at this
vector in particular.

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.890
We can draw it again over
here, just to see it.

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.760
Here s.

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.474
Here is rsi.

00:02:24.474 --> 00:02:30.742
Here is the vector
rs, that's rsj.

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:42.250
And we want to now consider
the vector rsi minus rsj.

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.250
Notice that this
vector is directed

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:50.290
along the lines connecting the
i-th and the j-th particle.

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.730
And we've made an
assumption that fji is also

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.000
along that line.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.990
So these two vectors,
in this particular case,

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:04.960
are either parallel
or anti-parallel.

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:10.240
And hence, the torque due
to the sum of these internal

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:13.210
forces cancel in pairs.

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:15.490
And this means we
only need to address

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:17.950
the torque due to
external forces that

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.866
are acting on individual
elements in a body.

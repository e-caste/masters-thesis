00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:23.835
PROFESSOR: OK, interactive
teaching.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.500
Here is a famous graph produced
by Benjamin bloom and

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:40.560
his students.

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.910
So here on this axis is
student achievement.

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:54.550
So after a course is
over, students are

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:56.070
tested on the material.

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.700
And here's their score.

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.020
And this is the percentage
who attained each score.

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.610
So here, they compared three
methods of teaching, but I'll

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.660
just compare two.

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:12.460
So one method is standard
one-group instruction, say

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.440
one-to-30, or today,
maybe one-to-90.

00:01:21.672 --> 00:01:25.180
And here is the histogram, the
distribution of students'

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.400
scores, nicely spread out.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.050
Now, by itself, it
doesn't say much.

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:34.890
But what's really interesting is
the distribution base after

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.510
the same amount of teaching, but
done in a tutorial form,

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:40.260
with one-to-one or
maybe one-to-two.

00:01:48.244 --> 00:01:51.340
You can put some quantitative
figures on this

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.690
from Bloom's results.

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:54.830
The average--

00:01:54.830 --> 00:02:06.810
so this is one-to-one
tutoring, one-to-30.

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:13.830
The average tutorial student is
two sigmas better than the

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.020
group students.

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.830
In other words, the average
tutorial student is at the

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.840
98th percentile of the ordinary
teaching group.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.610
So the question is--

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.870
the natural question is, how can
we make group instruction

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.260
as effective as tutorial
instruction?

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.310
As Benjamin Bloom says, he says,
finding such methods

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.680
would be an educational
contribution of

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.190
the greatest magnitude.

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.230
Because, for example,
it would change our

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.340
notions about human potential.

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.540
We'd actually realize, oh,
actually, there's not that

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.530
much innate in what
people can do.

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.080
Most of it is how well they've
learned, how well

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.750
they've been taught.

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.590
So the great question--

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.170
and it's the title of Bloom's
paper-- is the search for

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.980
methods of group instruction
as effective

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.540
as one-to-one tutoring.

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.320
To that end, let's think about
the following question, which

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:17.220
is, what makes tutoring
so effective?

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.460
So I'm going to ask you that,
to consider that question in

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:24.140
groups of two and three,
whatever's sort of convenient

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:25.960
in your region of the room.

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:28.990
So, what makes tutoring
so effective?

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:32.320
After you discuss, we'll take
reasons, put them on the

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:36.700
board, and then I'll show you
methods of group instruction

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.770
that may not quite get us all
the way to tutoring, but that

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:42.790
answer many of the good
characteristics of tutoring

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.940
and bring them into
group instruction.

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.910
OK, so please find one
or two neighbors.

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:50.980
Introduce yourselves.

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:51.540
You never know.

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.400
You might find a teaching
colleague.

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.450
And think about what makes
tutoring so effective.

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:02.670
OK, so take 30 seconds
and collect

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:03.920
your thoughts together.

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.020
OK, who would like to suggest
something that your group

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.360
thought of?

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.720
You don't necessarily have to
believe it, just something you

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.740
discussed and think
we should share.

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.570
Yes?

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:23.430
Could you tell me your name?

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:24.140
AUDIENCE: Elena.

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.485
PROFESSOR: Elena.

00:04:24.485 --> 00:04:26.990
AUDIENCE: For one-on-one
tutoring, I imagine there's

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:31.554
less time for misconceptions
to get

00:04:31.554 --> 00:04:33.030
ingrained in your brain.

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:35.100
PROFESSOR: OK, you can nip
misconceptions in the bud.

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.820
Whereas in, for example, group
instruction, you may not even

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:50.750
know the students have
a misconception

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:53.090
until the final exam.

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:55.510
Then what do you do?

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:57.320
OK, let's see.

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:58.766
This group, could you
tell me your name?

00:04:58.766 --> 00:04:59.580
AUDIENCE: So we thought--

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:00.840
PROFESSOR: Could you
tell me your name?

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:01.302
AUDIENCE: Eric.

00:05:01.302 --> 00:05:02.688
PROFESSOR: Eric.

00:05:02.688 --> 00:05:05.030
AUDIENCE: We thought in a group,
there's probably a lot

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:08.774
of just dissemination
of information.

00:05:08.774 --> 00:05:11.259
And in one-on-one tutoring, it's
probably not one person

00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:13.605
just telling person two
a bunch of stuff.

00:05:13.605 --> 00:05:16.440
It's going through
exam problems.

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:17.010
PROFESSOR: Right, OK.

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:20.640
So the contrast in this is
what does the teaching

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:21.520
situation look like?

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:25.430
In a typical lecture, someone
may just talk at you for 50

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:28.970
minutes, whereas it's hard to
imagine a one-on-one tutorial

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:31.960
situation where you walk in for
your tutorial, and they

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:33.820
just talk at you
for 50 minutes.

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:37.400
That would seem so odd and so
counter to all conventions of

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:38.650
human discussion.

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:42.800
It would take a really, really
disciplined and well-trained

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.840
person to sit still for 50
minutes for that kind of

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:49.880
treatment, so not initially a
good kind of training either.

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:55.140
OK, so I'll say you cannot
yammer at the audience for 50

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:56.390
minutes straight.

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:09.830
Yes, can you tell
me your name?

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:10.370
AUDIENCE: Sorry?

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:11.570
PROFESSOR: Could you
tell me your name?

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:12.120
AUDIENCE: I'm Whitney.

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:12.660
PROFESSOR: Whitney

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:16.580
AUDIENCE: I think it follows
from this discussion that

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:24.420
arises between two people that
the student experiences

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:27.360
validation of what they've
understood, and it helps build

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:28.360
their confidence.

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:30.830
PROFESSOR: OK, because they're
talking in a small group, so

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:33.050
they can get validation
in a safe setting.

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:34.640
Is that?

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:37.440
OK, so it's safe.

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:43.890
It's a safe setting for raising
ideas maybe that

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:45.140
you're not sure about.

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:55.280
OK, there was one more.

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:56.330
Yeah, can you tell
me your name?

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:56.870
AUDIENCE: Martin.

00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:57.670
PROFESSOR: Martin.

00:06:57.670 --> 00:06:58.315
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:06:58.315 --> 00:07:01.030
With tutoring, it's much easier
to identify exactly

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:04.930
what the student has trouble
understanding, and then tailor

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:07.026
the teaching according
to that.

00:07:07.026 --> 00:07:09.810
PROFESSOR: OK, so you can tailor
the teaching according

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:11.230
to what you find out.

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:15.920
So sort of like the new
electronic SATs.

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:18.410
According to what you don't
know or do know, in each

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:20.930
question, they give you
questions based on your

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:23.600
previous answers at the right
level of difficulty.

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:24.850
So you can tailor.

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:37.550
Yeah, can you tell
me your name?

00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:37.890
AUDIENCE: Azrael.

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:39.462
PROFESSOR: Azrael, yeah.

00:07:39.462 --> 00:07:42.360
AUDIENCE: I think related to
this, it's very valuable to be

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:44.676
able to tailor your teaching
style to the student

00:07:44.676 --> 00:07:45.926
[INAUDIBLE]

00:07:48.008 --> 00:07:51.350
in general, not just specific
points [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:52.670
PROFESSOR: OK, you can
tailor the teaching

00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:53.740
style to the student.

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:56.460
If, for example, the
student is--

00:07:56.460 --> 00:07:58.790
for example, suppose you're
teaching math to somebody

00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:00.280
who's an architect.

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:02.670
Well, you can use lots of
examples that are particular

00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:04.940
to something they're totally
fascinated by.

00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:06.745
You can tailor a teaching
method.

00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:14.440
OK, let me get something from
somewhere back there, in case

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:16.140
I've been neglecting people
way in the back.

00:08:19.044 --> 00:08:21.820
Oh, go ahead.

00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:22.655
You guys had your chance.

00:08:22.655 --> 00:08:24.290
I'll be back.

00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:26.170
Can you tell me your name?

00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:27.190
AUDIENCE: Graham.

00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:28.940
PROFESSOR: Graham.

00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:31.730
AUDIENCE: Just the level of
engagement, it is impossible

00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:37.640
to sit there in a one-on-one
setting and think about the

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:39.919
music you like [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:39.919 --> 00:08:42.600
the subject matter at hand.

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:43.030
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:47.200
OK, so the level of engagement
is much higher in a tutorial.

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:50.440
So that's the complement
of this one.

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:52.610
So the student engagement
is much higher.

00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:06.350
Yeah, just as it's hard for a
teacher in a tutorial setting

00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:09.840
to just talk for 50 minutes
straight, it's also hard for a

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:13.020
student in a tutorial session to
surf the web for 50 minutes

00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:17.140
straight, or use their
BlackBerry or read the

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:19.780
newspaper or whatever it may be
that the standard methods

00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:22.010
of lecture distraction are.

00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:22.900
Yes, can you tell
me your name?

00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:25.325
AUDIENCE: Question about
the conditions in these

00:09:25.325 --> 00:09:26.295
experiments.

00:09:26.295 --> 00:09:29.960
So normally in a university
setting in this country,

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:31.480
tutoring is something that
students seek out for

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:32.460
themselves.

00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:34.890
It's not something that's
provided in lieu of lecture.

00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:37.760
Was that the case in this?

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:40.160
Was it really just that the same
material was covered in

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:42.240
the same semester and they
just did it two different

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:44.490
ways, and everybody had
to go to tutoring?

00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:47.210
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so what
they did was--

00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:49.250
I don't think these were
university students.

00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:51.240
I think these were high
school and even

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:52.440
grade school students.

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:53.600
Yeah.

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:56.480
But what they did was they
took the same number of

00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:59.545
teaching hours, and they either
taught them in lecture

00:09:59.545 --> 00:10:02.100
or they taught them in
tutorials, one-on-one, or I

00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:03.200
think sometimes one-on-two.

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:06.355
AUDIENCE: So in both cases, they
were required to go to

00:10:06.355 --> 00:10:07.000
class, in a sense.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:07.590
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:08.890
I mean, I don't know
if they actually

00:10:08.890 --> 00:10:10.220
went to the big class.

00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:13.670
But I'm sure they went to
the tutorial class.

00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:15.420
That's partly of one
of the differences.

00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:17.420
That's number six.

00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:19.292
Yes, way in the back.

00:10:19.292 --> 00:10:21.440
AUDIENCE: From experience,
I've found that you know

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:22.636
students don't understand
something.

00:10:22.636 --> 00:10:24.975
You don't why until
you sit down.

00:10:24.975 --> 00:10:27.380
Usually you find there's some
gaping hole that's quite often

00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:28.790
easily plugged.

00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:29.340
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:31.260
And how do you find that out?

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:32.651
AUDIENCE: You start asking them,
what class did you have?

00:10:32.651 --> 00:10:35.417
What did you not understand?

00:10:35.417 --> 00:10:37.463
And sometimes they'll just
bubble [? right out, ?]

00:10:37.463 --> 00:10:39.660
I never got this one
key concept.

00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:42.140
PROFESSOR: OK, so you can ask
them questions, specific

00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:54.180
questions to figure out what
they don't know, to diagnose

00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:55.430
what they're confused about.

00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:03.930
OK, let's take one more, and
then I'll show you some

00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:08.280
methods that hopefully address
what these characteristics--

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:10.250
these missing characteristics
of group instruction.

00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:11.813
Yes?

00:11:11.813 --> 00:11:15.583
AUDIENCE: On one-on-one
tutoring, for the student who

00:11:15.583 --> 00:11:18.430
might not be as into the effort
[INAUDIBLE] added

00:11:18.430 --> 00:11:21.860
pressure, just feeling that
there are other people

00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:24.310
[INAUDIBLE]

00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:27.740
student, there's no feeling of
why I need to learn much more,

00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:28.990
[INAUDIBLE].

00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:33.810
You don't really prepare
yourself for anyone else.

00:11:33.810 --> 00:11:35.480
PROFESSOR: Right, so the
method of teaching

00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:38.160
automatically adjusts to
whatever level the student is.

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:39.980
So they're not comparing
to other people.

00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:42.250
They're are actually just
comparing to what they don't

00:11:42.250 --> 00:11:43.710
know right then.

00:11:43.710 --> 00:11:47.630
So let's just call it intrinsic
comparison with the

00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:50.015
knowledge, rather than extrinsic
with other students.

00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:07.450
OK, so there's less emotional
churn as a result of that.

00:12:07.450 --> 00:12:10.350
OK, so we could continue
this list, but this is

00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:12.170
an excellent start.

00:12:12.170 --> 00:12:15.140
So now, if we look through that
list, there's several

00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:16.060
themes that come out.

00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:19.070
I mean, it's hard in a group
setting to figure out what

00:12:19.070 --> 00:12:20.230
students don't know.

00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:22.020
It's hard to ask
them questions.

00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:24.560
It's hard to keep
people engaged.

00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:27.980
It's easy to just talk at
people as a teacher.

00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:32.280
So what can we do in group
teaching to capture as many

00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:34.810
characteristics of
this as we can?

00:12:34.810 --> 00:12:39.530
Well, I'll show you methods that
I divide into four time

00:12:39.530 --> 00:12:43.810
scales, ranging from
short to long.

00:12:43.810 --> 00:12:46.700
But before I do that, let me ask
if there are any questions

00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:47.950
on anything so far.

00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:52.250
OK.

00:12:52.250 --> 00:12:53.391
You were first.

00:12:53.391 --> 00:12:54.864
AUDIENCE: How is student
achievement measured?

00:12:54.864 --> 00:12:55.850
Is it just test scores?

00:12:55.850 --> 00:12:57.180
PROFESSOR: Yeah, that
was a test score.

00:12:57.180 --> 00:13:02.080
So what they did is, actually
they gave them a test.

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:04.750
Like, if it was algebra, they
gave them an algebra test, and

00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:07.580
then tested them at the end, and
at the beginning too, just

00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:08.880
to see where they were
to start with.

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:10.630
AUDIENCE: So were the lectures
more tailored to just teaching

00:13:10.630 --> 00:13:13.880
them algebra, and the tutoring
was specifically tailored to

00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:15.380
doing problems in algebra?

00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:18.270
PROFESSOR: Well, the tutoring
was whatever they needed to do

00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:19.110
well on the test.

00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:20.550
And the lecturing was hopefully

00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:21.840
designed that way too.

00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:25.340
But it had all the flaws of, you
want to teach so students

00:13:25.340 --> 00:13:26.560
will do well on your
final exam.

00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:28.530
But what do you do
when you have 30

00:13:28.530 --> 00:13:31.310
diverse students in there?

00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:32.070
You had a question too.

00:13:32.070 --> 00:13:35.256
AUDIENCE: I was just wondering,
do we know which of

00:13:35.256 --> 00:13:38.620
these particular suggestions
are the most important, and

00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:41.020
which ones might be good?

00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:42.740
PROFESSOR: We have some idea.

00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:43.290
Good question.

00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:46.600
The question is which of these
is most important, and which

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:47.530
is less important.

00:13:47.530 --> 00:13:50.600
Actually, they're all getting
at something similar.

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:53.010
But there's a middle group in
there, actually, that they

00:13:53.010 --> 00:13:56.380
studied, which was
mastery learning.

00:13:56.380 --> 00:14:01.860
So mastery learning, it's just
like a programmed instruction.

00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:03.610
So the idea is that--

00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:05.480
Keller Plan is another
word for it.

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:08.190
So mastery learning is midway
between tutoring and group

00:14:08.190 --> 00:14:09.010
instruction.

00:14:09.010 --> 00:14:11.860
There was one sigma better,
so 84th percentile.

00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:15.910
So mastery learning, you don't
go on to the new topics until

00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:18.540
you pass the mastery exam
on the previous topic.

00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:20.810
So you're always building
on a solid foundation.

00:14:20.810 --> 00:14:22.960
And so you work until you can
pass the exam, and then you

00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:24.010
continue on.

00:14:24.010 --> 00:14:27.140
And just by adding that to group
instruction, you get one

00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:28.370
sigma better.

00:14:28.370 --> 00:14:31.980
So right away, diagnosing
misconceptions, you can see,

00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:32.700
is quite important.

00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:36.320
But there's still another
one sigma to get.

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:39.110
And so that's, I think,
what all the rest of

00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:41.860
these items are about.

00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:44.540
And we do know a lot of stuff
about how people learn.

00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:46.990
One of it is questions.

00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:48.280
Questions are essential.

00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:49.670
So I'm going to talk
about that.

00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:51.380
But let me just ask again,
any questions?

00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:56.800
OK, good.

00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:58.070
This time it worked.

00:14:58.070 --> 00:14:59.870
So now, what did I do?

00:14:59.870 --> 00:15:02.240
So this is actually
the first method.

00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:05.315
So how long did I wait after
I said, any questions?

00:15:09.030 --> 00:15:11.270
Half a second?

00:15:11.270 --> 00:15:11.740
One minute?

00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:14.280
No, five seconds.

00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:16.070
So the first time, I didn't
wait five seconds, because

00:15:16.070 --> 00:15:20.100
actually a question came up a
little before five seconds.

00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:22.630
But this time, the second time,
I waited five seconds.

00:15:22.630 --> 00:15:23.360
Now, why is that?

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:25.240
So that is the first method.

00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:27.850
When you ask a question--

00:15:27.850 --> 00:15:30.460
for example, "any questions"
or "what do you think about

00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:32.030
this"-- wait five seconds.

00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:33.570
And I'll explain why
in a second.

00:15:33.570 --> 00:15:38.935
But, methods shortest
to longest.

00:15:43.970 --> 00:15:49.240
The reason I divide them by
shortest to longest is the

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:50.650
shortest ones are
the easiest to

00:15:50.650 --> 00:15:51.990
incorporate into your teaching.

00:15:51.990 --> 00:15:55.450
So anytime you teach, if you
ask a question, wait five

00:15:55.450 --> 00:15:57.600
seconds, so the five-second
time scale.

00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:10.990
OK, so why do I wait
five seconds,

00:16:10.990 --> 00:16:13.030
and why not two seconds?

00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:16.970
Well, the reason is, think
about your audience.

00:16:16.970 --> 00:16:19.800
Suppose you're talking away at
them, and all the sudden you

00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:21.450
ask a question.

00:16:21.450 --> 00:16:23.280
Now, what are they hearing?

00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:26.810
So everyone's seen
Charlie Brown?

00:16:26.810 --> 00:16:29.560
So what does Charlie Brown hear
when he goes to school?

00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:32.790
Wah wah wah wah wah wah wah wah
wah wah wah wah, and all

00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:34.515
of a sudden that changes
and there's a question.

00:16:34.515 --> 00:16:36.845
It takes about a second to
realize that the wah wah wah

00:16:36.845 --> 00:16:40.010
has stopped, and you're being
asked a question.

00:16:40.010 --> 00:16:41.830
OK, so one second's gone.

00:16:41.830 --> 00:16:43.820
Let's call it that, the
thumb-- one second.

00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:47.760
Now, it takes about another
second to even figure out what

00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:49.270
the question is.

00:16:49.270 --> 00:16:51.340
Now you say, oh yeah, there's
a question being asked.

00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:52.050
What did they say?

00:16:52.050 --> 00:16:54.710
OK, maybe now let's say it's
one and a half seconds.

00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:58.070
So now we're at somewhere
between two and three seconds.

00:16:58.070 --> 00:17:01.610
Now it takes maybe one or two
more seconds to figure out

00:17:01.610 --> 00:17:02.980
what you're going to
say about that.

00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:04.069
Do I have any thoughts
about it?

00:17:04.069 --> 00:17:05.160
Do I actually have
any questions?

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:07.160
Do I have a thought about the
thing they're asking me?

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:10.150
Do I know what the band gap is
in silicon, whatever the

00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:10.849
question may be?

00:17:10.849 --> 00:17:15.770
So now we're somewhere between
four, maybe near five seconds.

00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:18.270
And then it maybe takes another
second to get the

00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:21.430
courage up to raise your hand
and be ready with a sentence.

00:17:21.430 --> 00:17:23.589
So now we're at least
five seconds.

00:17:23.589 --> 00:17:27.310
So if you don't wait those five
seconds, what you'll get

00:17:27.310 --> 00:17:30.200
is, you'll be getting a few
questions, but you'll get

00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:31.940
questions from people who
already thought about the

00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:34.490
material, in other words, the
people who are already at the

00:17:34.490 --> 00:17:35.930
98th percentile.

00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:38.200
But if you want to bring
everybody in, and get

00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:41.930
everybody thinking about it,
you really need to wait, so

00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:45.020
you don't get questions just
from the usual suspects.

00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:46.810
So wait five seconds.

00:17:46.810 --> 00:17:49.410
Now, the mechanism is
quite important.

00:17:49.410 --> 00:17:51.980
If you just say, OK I'm going
to wait five seconds, you'll

00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:54.380
go, any questions.

00:17:54.380 --> 00:17:56.960
Oh, done, five seconds is up.

00:17:56.960 --> 00:18:01.560
And you'll think five seconds
is up in about one second.

00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:02.280
And why is that?

00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:05.510
Well, you're up in front of a
whole bunch of people, and the

00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:07.100
adrenaline will be flowing.

00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:09.700
And adrenaline speeds
up your time sense.

00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:12.420
All those stories about people
who-- like mothers who saw

00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:15.070
their kid about to get hit by
the car, they race out and

00:18:15.070 --> 00:18:17.780
grab the kid and the
car keeps going.

00:18:17.780 --> 00:18:19.660
Maybe it screeches to a stop.

00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:20.975
They've managed to
rescue their kid.

00:18:20.975 --> 00:18:23.930
Well, they could act much faster
because adrenaline

00:18:23.930 --> 00:18:25.660
makes the time sense
much sharper.

00:18:25.660 --> 00:18:29.820
So your idea of five seconds
will be more like one second.

00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:33.570
There's another reason, which is
there's this mistaken idea

00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:36.870
that if you're not talking,
you're not teaching.

00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:38.740
So you're being paid to teach.

00:18:38.740 --> 00:18:41.370
And oh my god, you're
not saying anything.

00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:43.600
That means you must not
know something.

00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:46.790
So you feel insecure, and that
increases the adrenaline and

00:18:46.790 --> 00:18:48.180
only speeds up the time
problem more.

00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:51.530
So to wait five seconds, you
actually have to count it --

00:18:51.530 --> 00:18:56.620
one 1,000, two 1,000, three
1,000, four 1,000, five 1,000.

00:18:56.620 --> 00:18:59.460
And I actually sometimes just
do it behind my back with my

00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:01.890
hand-- one 1,000, two
1,000, three 1,000,

00:19:01.890 --> 00:19:03.770
four 1,000, five 1,000.

00:19:03.770 --> 00:19:06.410
And it's not like you have to
be watching the audience for

00:19:06.410 --> 00:19:08.040
the whole five seconds.

00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:11.075
It's actually better to wait
the whole five seconds, and

00:19:11.075 --> 00:19:13.240
then choose one of the hands
that has gone up rather than

00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:15.390
the first hand that goes
up at two seconds.

00:19:15.390 --> 00:19:18.140
You say, oh, thank god, somebody
asked a question.

00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:19.470
OK, now my waiting is over.

00:19:19.470 --> 00:19:22.220
Well, again, you'll be back
in the usual suspect soup.

00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:28.640
So, first time scale for
bringing in questions, in

00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:32.180
other words, spreading the
engagement through the class.

00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:34.390
Because when people are asking
questions, they're by

00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:35.730
definition engaged.

00:19:35.730 --> 00:19:37.070
They're struggling with
the material.

00:19:37.070 --> 00:19:39.970
They're trying to make
it their own.

00:19:39.970 --> 00:19:43.170
Wait five seconds.

00:19:43.170 --> 00:19:45.870
OK, the next method.

00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:51.000
So the next method is short
time scale, one minute.

00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:59.160
And that is to use a feedback
sheet at the end of every

00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:00.410
teaching session.

00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:11.400
So you actually have an example
of a feedback sheet

00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:13.880
that we'll ask you to fill out
at the end of this session,

00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:16.980
which we handed out
at the beginning.

00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:22.460
And the blank versions of that
sheet will also be on the TLL

00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:25.810
website, so you can actually
download it, print it, and use

00:20:25.810 --> 00:20:28.090
it in your own teaching,
as well as my notes

00:20:28.090 --> 00:20:28.820
on how to use it.

00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:32.030
But the main point is that at
the end of the class, you give

00:20:32.030 --> 00:20:34.210
the students one or two
minutes to fill

00:20:34.210 --> 00:20:35.590
out a feedback sheet.

00:20:35.590 --> 00:20:38.560
And what I've converged on is
the following three questions

00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:42.950
on my feedback sheet, which is,
what was most confusing?

00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:44.810
Basically, what question
you have that

00:20:44.810 --> 00:20:46.550
still wasn't answered.

00:20:46.550 --> 00:20:50.980
Second question is, what was
the most useful or most

00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:55.550
useless example or demonstration
or teaching

00:20:55.550 --> 00:20:57.650
method that happened today?

00:20:57.650 --> 00:20:59.940
And the third question is,
any other comments?

00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:03.280
So now let me explain why I
use those three questions.

00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:06.610
The first question, these sheets
are all anonymous.

00:21:06.610 --> 00:21:10.410
And it's a chance for someone,
if they felt a little bit shy

00:21:10.410 --> 00:21:15.800
asking questions in front of
people-- so here in the

00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:17.530
tutorial, one of the
characteristics that was

00:21:17.530 --> 00:21:20.080
mentioned was that you don't
feel nervous about asking a

00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:21.940
question, because there's no
one there, or maybe there's

00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:23.310
one other person there.

00:21:23.310 --> 00:21:26.350
Whereas in a class of
30 or 80 or 20, you

00:21:26.350 --> 00:21:27.520
may feel a bit nervous.

00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:29.150
Well, if you feel a bit nervous,
you just put your

00:21:29.150 --> 00:21:30.760
question on the feedback
sheet.

00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:33.520
And so then at the beginning of
the next session, I answer

00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:35.080
all the questions on the
feedback sheets.

00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:38.010
So it takes me more than one
minute, but actually not that

00:21:38.010 --> 00:21:39.270
much longer.

00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:41.120
Because you could
flip through 100

00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:43.710
sheets in about 10 minutes.

00:21:43.710 --> 00:21:44.730
You just glance through.

00:21:44.730 --> 00:21:47.260
You'll see a bunch of questions
are repeated.

00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:51.040
And you'll say, oh yeah, I do
really need to explain that.

00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:54.310
And at the beginning in the next
session, just explain all

00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:56.800
the important points.

00:21:56.800 --> 00:21:59.990
And that has another benefit,
which is that it links back to

00:21:59.990 --> 00:22:02.550
the previous lecture, or the
previous teaching session.

00:22:02.550 --> 00:22:05.000
So now you've made a thread
between the previous session

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.190
and the current one, and you got
everyone up to speed into

00:22:08.190 --> 00:22:10.030
the space where you
want them to be.

00:22:10.030 --> 00:22:11.830
So that's why I use the
first question.

00:22:11.830 --> 00:22:15.250
The second question
is, what worked?

00:22:15.250 --> 00:22:16.480
What didn't work?

00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:18.700
And I also had to add, and tell
me whether it worked or

00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:19.180
didn't work.

00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:21.850
Because I used to get examples
saying, that example.

00:22:21.850 --> 00:22:24.460
And I didn't know whether they
loved it or hated it.

00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:26.640
So then I said, please
tell me the sign of

00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:28.690
the effect as well.

00:22:28.690 --> 00:22:30.330
And then I would know.

00:22:30.330 --> 00:22:33.040
I would start to build a model
of how students think and what

00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:34.100
works for them.

00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:35.910
So every time, basically, I
learned that I brought in a

00:22:35.910 --> 00:22:38.330
demonstration, there
was universal love

00:22:38.330 --> 00:22:39.980
on the second question.

00:22:39.980 --> 00:22:41.980
So I said, OK, that really
connects with students.

00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:43.940
And I would make sure
to do more of that.

00:22:43.940 --> 00:22:47.040
So it was reinforcement for me
and practice for me at being a

00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:48.940
better teacher.

00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:52.130
And what you'll find is that as
you use the sheet more and

00:22:52.130 --> 00:22:54.830
more, you get better and better
at predicting how

00:22:54.830 --> 00:22:55.730
students think.

00:22:55.730 --> 00:22:58.390
So for example, you're doing
some discussion on the board,

00:22:58.390 --> 00:23:00.640
some examples on derivation.

00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:05.300
And the first time you do it,
maybe you don't know it's not

00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:06.100
going to go well.

00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:08.020
And then you read the sheet and
you see, oh my god, I was

00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:08.860
a disaster.

00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:12.360
30 questions out of 80 all said,
I didn't understand x.

00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:15.090
So now you understand that
students didn't understand the

00:23:15.090 --> 00:23:15.920
way you did it.

00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:17.860
Well, now you've built
a better model of

00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:19.250
how students think.

00:23:19.250 --> 00:23:21.840
So next time you're doing a
derivation, what you'll find

00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:23.890
is-- at least what I've found
is in the middle of the

00:23:23.890 --> 00:23:26.860
derivation, I'll realize, oh,
this is not going well.

00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:27.850
I'm going to get a
lot of questions

00:23:27.850 --> 00:23:29.240
about this on the sheet.

00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:30.700
Oops, but it's to late.

00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:31.850
I'm in the middle of the soup.

00:23:31.850 --> 00:23:33.570
I can't un-drink the soup.

00:23:33.570 --> 00:23:37.100
So I just finish the soup and
just wait for the questions.

00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:40.010
But then after maybe another
week of using the sheet, you

00:23:40.010 --> 00:23:41.960
actually have quite a good
model of the students.

00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:44.620
And now before you start the
derivation or when you're

00:23:44.620 --> 00:23:47.380
planning the lecture, you
realize, oh yeah, that's not

00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:48.010
going to go well.

00:23:48.010 --> 00:23:49.590
Let me do it the other
way, because I

00:23:49.590 --> 00:23:51.000
know that works better.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:54.140
So you'll find your model of the
students developing more

00:23:54.140 --> 00:23:56.370
and more refinements and
more and more accuracy.

00:23:56.370 --> 00:23:57.610
In other words, you're becoming

00:23:57.610 --> 00:23:59.240
a more expert teacher.

00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:01.030
And then the third question
on the sheet

00:24:01.030 --> 00:24:03.410
is, any other comments?

00:24:03.410 --> 00:24:06.070
The reason for that is, it's
just a free-form space.

00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:08.830
And I've actually had students
say, oh, actually, when you

00:24:08.830 --> 00:24:12.050
explained that thing, you
actually explained it wrong.

00:24:12.050 --> 00:24:13.230
I was like, oh that's
good to know.

00:24:13.230 --> 00:24:14.850
So then in the beginning
of the--

00:24:14.850 --> 00:24:16.880
because we did it properly in
this other class, and here's

00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:18.920
the exact reference that you
maybe didn't know about.

00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:19.950
I was like, oh great.

00:24:19.950 --> 00:24:22.660
So at the beginning of the next
class, I say, hey, one of

00:24:22.660 --> 00:24:25.980
you guys pointed out a mistake
I made, and here is the

00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:27.290
corrected version.

00:24:27.290 --> 00:24:29.430
And people might not be
willing to say that

00:24:29.430 --> 00:24:30.920
personally, because they say,
oh my god, I don't want to

00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:32.790
correct the professor and
make them feel stupid.

00:24:32.790 --> 00:24:36.020
But it's much easier to do
it on an anonymous sheet.

00:24:36.020 --> 00:24:37.910
So I get really useful
information on that.

00:24:37.910 --> 00:24:39.500
And sometimes you can figure out
who did it, so you could

00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:42.480
send an email saying, oh thanks,
that was useful.

00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:42.820
All right.

00:24:42.820 --> 00:24:43.500
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:45.550
PROFESSOR: And it is.

00:24:45.550 --> 00:24:47.830
So you may think, oh no, you
don't want to be corrected.

00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:50.840
But actually, after you tell
the students the following

00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:54.930
enough, so it's again
back to this.

00:24:54.930 --> 00:24:57.120
In a group, students feel like,
oh my god, I don't want

00:24:57.120 --> 00:24:58.780
to make a mistake.

00:24:58.780 --> 00:25:01.540
So I give them the following
speech quite often.

00:25:01.540 --> 00:25:03.560
Because if you don't
make mistakes--

00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:06.000
I tell them, look, how
much did you know

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:07.140
when you were born?

00:25:07.140 --> 00:25:07.960
Not a hell of a lot.

00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:08.870
You couldn't talk.

00:25:08.870 --> 00:25:10.110
You couldn't hardly walk.

00:25:10.110 --> 00:25:12.240
Well, how do you learn stuff?

00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:14.790
Did you just all the sudden
start walking and talking?

00:25:14.790 --> 00:25:15.350
No.

00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:17.040
You mangled your grammar.

00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:19.720
You put "-ed" at the end of
every past participle, even

00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:21.950
though some don't have that.

00:25:21.950 --> 00:25:24.040
And eventually you sorted it
all out and you stood up

00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:25.300
straight and you walked.

00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:26.990
So basically, how
did you learn?

00:25:26.990 --> 00:25:28.350
By making mistakes.

00:25:28.350 --> 00:25:30.530
So the only way to learn
is to make mistakes.

00:25:30.530 --> 00:25:32.470
So if you don't make any
mistakes, you will learn--

00:25:32.470 --> 00:25:35.330
you'll know as much at the start
of your class as at the

00:25:35.330 --> 00:25:35.870
end of the class.

00:25:35.870 --> 00:25:37.280
So you want to make mistakes.

00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:38.930
So I tell them that
a bunch of times.

00:25:38.930 --> 00:25:41.920
But if then I'm really
embarrassed about making

00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:43.930
mistakes, then I've defeated the
whole purpose of telling

00:25:43.930 --> 00:25:44.700
students that.

00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:47.120
So I actually thank them
whenever they point out

00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:49.980
something that I didn't
do right.

00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:53.330
OK, so that's the second
time scale.

00:25:53.330 --> 00:25:57.690
Now, the third time scale
is not that much longer.

00:25:57.690 --> 00:25:59.830
It's about, let's say,
four or five minutes.

00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:06.650
And it's a question which I'll
call a conceptual multiple

00:26:06.650 --> 00:26:08.440
choice question.

00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:09.690
And I'll give you an example.

00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:21.740
OK, so here is the question
that I'll use

00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:22.990
to illustrate it.

00:26:44.450 --> 00:26:47.680
Here is a pyramid with
a square base.

00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:58.860
And it's B by B. The length of
one side of the base is B. And

00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:02.120
the perpendicular height of
the pyramid is H. OK, so

00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:03.370
what's the volume?

00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:32.070
OK, so does everyone understand
the question?

00:27:32.070 --> 00:27:32.500
OK.

00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:35.340
Give it a try.

00:27:35.340 --> 00:27:37.510
Find your group or one or two.

00:27:37.510 --> 00:27:39.450
Any questions--

00:27:39.450 --> 00:27:42.380
any confusions about
the question?

00:27:42.380 --> 00:27:44.750
Don't give me any answers just
yet, but any confusions about

00:27:44.750 --> 00:27:46.860
the question?

00:27:46.860 --> 00:27:51.680
OK, so find your groups of one
or two other people, and we'll

00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:53.395
discuss that question
in a couple minutes.

00:27:58.870 --> 00:28:02.620
Anyone want to say anything
about this?

00:28:05.986 --> 00:28:07.530
Is there a section I
haven't heard from?

00:28:07.530 --> 00:28:07.990
Yeah, go ahead.

00:28:07.990 --> 00:28:10.200
Can you just say your name?

00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:11.080
AUDIENCE: Brian.

00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:11.990
PROFESSOR: Brian, OK.

00:28:11.990 --> 00:28:15.080
So you like D but
not the others?

00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:19.430
OK, can you tell me, for
example, why you don't like A?

00:28:19.430 --> 00:28:22.990
AUDIENCE: Well, because all of
them just have the wrong

00:28:22.990 --> 00:28:24.472
proportionality.

00:28:24.472 --> 00:28:27.975
If B increases, then the square
is going to increase in

00:28:27.975 --> 00:28:29.500
area as B squared--

00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:31.710
PROFESSOR: Ah, so you would
like that to B squared.

00:28:31.710 --> 00:28:32.740
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:28:32.740 --> 00:28:35.590
PROFESSOR: Whereas it's just a
single B and a single H. OK,

00:28:35.590 --> 00:28:37.970
so you don't like that because
the proportionality is wrong.

00:28:37.970 --> 00:28:39.170
It doesn't scale correctly.

00:28:39.170 --> 00:28:41.390
So let me put here,
bad scaling.

00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:45.720
What was another problem?

00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:47.150
AUDIENCE: It also has
the wrong units.

00:28:47.150 --> 00:28:48.380
PROFESSOR: It has bogus units.

00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:52.198
OK, so it has bogus
dimensions.

00:28:52.198 --> 00:28:53.680
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
dimensions.

00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:56.310
PROFESSOR: No, they're pretty
much interchangeable.

00:28:56.310 --> 00:29:00.090
I use units to mean meters
or feet or something, and

00:29:00.090 --> 00:29:01.460
dimensions to be things
like length.

00:29:01.460 --> 00:29:04.160
But they're pretty much
interchangeable in usage.

00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:07.990
So bad scaling, bad
dimensions.

00:29:07.990 --> 00:29:10.660
OK, anyone have any
comments about B?

00:29:10.660 --> 00:29:11.650
AUDIENCE: Same.

00:29:11.650 --> 00:29:12.710
PROFESSOR: Same problem.

00:29:12.710 --> 00:29:15.130
In fact, it's even
more horrendous.

00:29:15.130 --> 00:29:18.220
Well, it starts out OK, I
mean, at least as far as

00:29:18.220 --> 00:29:19.680
dimensions are concerned.

00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:21.100
But then what does it do?

00:29:21.100 --> 00:29:22.330
This has the wrong dimensions.

00:29:22.330 --> 00:29:24.740
That has the right dimensions,
and then you add them.

00:29:24.740 --> 00:29:28.100
That's terrible.

00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:30.170
OK, so the dimensions
are just bogus.

00:29:30.170 --> 00:29:31.330
Ah, OK.

00:29:31.330 --> 00:29:36.470
Can anyone say anything
about choice C?

00:29:36.470 --> 00:29:37.458
Yeah?

00:29:37.458 --> 00:29:40.422
AUDIENCE: If you look at the
extremes, like if you make H

00:29:40.422 --> 00:29:41.910
very small--

00:29:41.910 --> 00:29:44.435
PROFESSOR: So if you stop on
this pyramid and step on it

00:29:44.435 --> 00:29:47.826
until H goes to 0, what happens
to the volume here?

00:29:47.826 --> 00:29:49.500
It goes to infinity.

00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:50.210
Yeah, it's terrible.

00:29:50.210 --> 00:29:52.260
So the extreme cases
are just bogus.

00:29:56.810 --> 00:29:58.400
So it fails that test.

00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:02.500
OK, now we're back to
D. So who likes D?

00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:03.440
So we have a few people
who like D.

00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:04.810
[STUDENT CALLS OUT]

00:30:04.810 --> 00:30:08.010
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:08.010 --> 00:30:10.840
PROFESSOR: OK, go ahead.

00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:11.590
You don't like D.

00:30:11.590 --> 00:30:12.250
AUDIENCE: No, I don't like D.

00:30:12.250 --> 00:30:13.065
PROFESSOR: OK, why not?

00:30:13.065 --> 00:30:14.262
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:14.262 --> 00:30:16.734
AUDIENCE: It's the volume of
the box, which has a size

00:30:16.734 --> 00:30:17.984
[INAUDIBLE].

00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:22.990
PROFESSOR: So this is the volume
of a box, in other

00:30:22.990 --> 00:30:24.360
words, if I had vertical
sides.

00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:25.930
So let me draw vertical
sides here.

00:30:29.350 --> 00:30:32.100
Right, so whereas the pyramid
has actually got to be less.

00:30:32.100 --> 00:30:34.320
Now, it's kind of mysterious
what this factor here should

00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:39.190
be, but it's definitely
less than 1.

00:30:39.190 --> 00:30:41.600
So this is comparison
with a box.

00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:44.030
So it has a good properties,
and it's a good answer.

00:30:44.030 --> 00:30:45.260
It's just not correct.

00:30:45.260 --> 00:30:49.400
But that's OK, because it's
important to realize what's

00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:51.200
good about it and what's
not good about it.

00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:54.250
So it satisfies the
extreme cases.

00:30:54.250 --> 00:30:55.660
It satisfies dimensions.

00:30:55.660 --> 00:30:56.680
It scales correctly.

00:30:56.680 --> 00:30:59.420
Like you pointed out, you want
B squared, because it's the

00:30:59.420 --> 00:31:00.770
area down there.

00:31:00.770 --> 00:31:03.140
So it's good.

00:31:03.140 --> 00:31:04.240
It's not all good.

00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:07.390
Let's call it good mostly.

00:31:07.390 --> 00:31:13.050
But as they say, a miss is as
good as a mile except in

00:31:13.050 --> 00:31:14.440
horseshoes and atom bombs.

00:31:16.990 --> 00:31:20.585
So good mostly, but
box comparison.

00:31:24.870 --> 00:31:29.560
OK, so let me cross this guy
out and this guy out

00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:30.830
and that guy out.

00:31:30.830 --> 00:31:32.710
So what do you conclude
from that?

00:31:32.710 --> 00:31:34.770
They're all wrong.

00:31:34.770 --> 00:31:36.620
So here's another multiple
choice question.

00:31:52.108 --> 00:31:53.560
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:56.900
PROFESSOR: OK, so
who votes for A?

00:31:56.900 --> 00:31:58.410
One of these is definitely
correct.

00:31:58.410 --> 00:32:00.106
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:00.106 --> 00:32:01.750
PROFESSOR: No votes for A?

00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:02.940
Who votes for B?

00:32:02.940 --> 00:32:04.830
Oh, I'm hurt.

00:32:04.830 --> 00:32:05.530
I'm hurt.

00:32:05.530 --> 00:32:07.900
Well, B is in fact correct.

00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:09.680
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:12.340
PROFESSOR: So every once in a
while, I throw the students a

00:32:12.340 --> 00:32:16.280
curve ball and make all
the choices wrong.

00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:19.990
Now, why would I do that, such
an evil, dastardly thing?

00:32:19.990 --> 00:32:24.190
Well, it's good every once
in a while to do that.

00:32:24.190 --> 00:32:27.210
In fact, I found that out
experimentally, because the

00:32:27.210 --> 00:32:29.460
first time I used this question
with the students, I

00:32:29.460 --> 00:32:31.360
was already using the
feedback sheets.

00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:34.730
And on the feedback sheets, I
got back tons of love on the

00:32:34.730 --> 00:32:35.910
comment sheets.

00:32:35.910 --> 00:32:38.590
The students said, oh,
we love that, having

00:32:38.590 --> 00:32:40.350
all the answers wrong.

00:32:40.350 --> 00:32:42.160
Don't do it too often, but do
it every once in a while,

00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:44.120
maybe once a month or so.

00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:46.350
And that way, they never know
when it's coming, so they

00:32:46.350 --> 00:32:47.910
always have to check
all the answers.

00:32:47.910 --> 00:32:50.210
They can't just do everything
by elimination.

00:32:50.210 --> 00:32:52.510
So it is a very useful
thing to do.

00:32:52.510 --> 00:32:54.630
There are other reasons for it
too, and if you're curious,

00:32:54.630 --> 00:32:56.470
ask me in the questions,
and I'll explain more

00:32:56.470 --> 00:32:57.320
reasons to do it.

00:32:57.320 --> 00:32:59.940
But that's already a
sufficient reason.

00:32:59.940 --> 00:33:01.850
OK, so that's method three.

00:33:01.850 --> 00:33:05.460
And you see you get a
bit of discussion.

00:33:05.460 --> 00:33:07.180
You get multiple choices.

00:33:07.180 --> 00:33:09.260
And what does that allow
you to do right away?

00:33:09.260 --> 00:33:12.130
Well, what was one
of the problems?

00:33:12.130 --> 00:33:14.760
Is, you can find out
what misconception

00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:16.190
students have early.

00:33:16.190 --> 00:33:19.320
Point one up there, in
a tutorial, you can

00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:20.740
ask students questions.

00:33:20.740 --> 00:33:23.220
Well, why not ask some
questions in

00:33:23.220 --> 00:33:24.600
a big lecture too?

00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:26.200
So that's what we just did.

00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:26.990
So you can find out.

00:33:26.990 --> 00:33:30.250
If 90% of the students get it
like that, you know you don't

00:33:30.250 --> 00:33:32.100
have to say much more
about the topic.

00:33:32.100 --> 00:33:34.720
But if the answers are
distributed at the monkey

00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:39.040
line, 25% for all the answers,
then you know there's going to

00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:39.760
be trouble.

00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:42.570
And it's worth actually
expanding on this point and

00:33:42.570 --> 00:33:45.500
the theme that question gets
across right then in lecture.

00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:48.790
So you could make it much more
tailored to the group of

00:33:48.790 --> 00:33:50.040
students you have.

00:33:52.450 --> 00:33:55.990
And the students also--

00:33:55.990 --> 00:33:59.840
what happens in their
small groups?

00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:02.180
Right, so remember we mentioned
that in a tutorial,

00:34:02.180 --> 00:34:04.600
that it's a safe setting for
raising questions, whereas a

00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:05.830
big group might not be.

00:34:05.830 --> 00:34:08.719
Well, what have we done by
letting everyone work in

00:34:08.719 --> 00:34:10.060
groups of two or three?

00:34:10.060 --> 00:34:14.679
We've created a whole bunch of
safe settings for questions.

00:34:14.679 --> 00:34:16.650
So the students are free
to discuss in their

00:34:16.650 --> 00:34:17.480
groups of two or three.

00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:20.070
And if they can't resolve it
there, well then they feel

00:34:20.070 --> 00:34:22.270
pretty confident that it's
worthwhile sharing it with the

00:34:22.270 --> 00:34:22.810
whole class.

00:34:22.810 --> 00:34:24.540
Maybe the whole class
can learn something

00:34:24.540 --> 00:34:25.790
from that as well.

00:34:29.330 --> 00:34:34.290
And that has another benefit,
which is that it gets around

00:34:34.290 --> 00:34:36.020
the gender imbalance.

00:34:36.020 --> 00:34:40.920
So to illustrate this problem,
I was once in a

00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:41.900
bookstore in New York.

00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:44.199
And I was standing in the
computer section and this

00:34:44.199 --> 00:34:45.860
couple walked up the stairs.

00:34:45.860 --> 00:34:48.659
And the woman asked the
man, oh, there's some

00:34:48.659 --> 00:34:49.820
big fat book on Java.

00:34:49.820 --> 00:34:51.750
And she said, what's Java?

00:34:51.750 --> 00:34:54.850
And within a millisecond, not
batting an eyelid, he said,

00:34:54.850 --> 00:34:57.640
oh, it's the fastest search
engine on the internet, which

00:34:57.640 --> 00:34:58.820
is completely rubbish.

00:34:58.820 --> 00:35:01.070
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:01.070 --> 00:35:02.390
PROFESSOR: It's a programming
language.

00:35:02.390 --> 00:35:04.390
So it has absolutely nothing
to do with a search engine.

00:35:04.390 --> 00:35:06.940
I'm sure no search engine
is even written in Java.

00:35:06.940 --> 00:35:08.160
So it has nothing to do
with search engines.

00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:09.810
So it's a complete lie.

00:35:09.810 --> 00:35:11.870
But he said it so fast.

00:35:11.870 --> 00:35:15.110
So there's a dichotomy there,
which is-- generally speaking,

00:35:15.110 --> 00:35:17.020
it's called actually male
answer syndrome.

00:35:17.020 --> 00:35:17.720
And the women--

00:35:17.720 --> 00:35:18.170
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:18.170 --> 00:35:20.820
PROFESSOR: I see all the women
laughing, or I hear all the

00:35:20.820 --> 00:35:21.430
women laughing.

00:35:21.430 --> 00:35:24.100
Well, what you'll find is
generally, men are very

00:35:24.100 --> 00:35:28.010
willing to talk about stuff
they know nothing about,

00:35:28.010 --> 00:35:31.830
speaking crudely in extreme
caricatures, whereas women are

00:35:31.830 --> 00:35:34.610
reluctant to talk about stuff
they even know about.

00:35:34.610 --> 00:35:39.020
So if you just ask a question to
a group just flat out, even

00:35:39.020 --> 00:35:42.740
with the five-second wait,
you're more likely to get

00:35:42.740 --> 00:35:46.430
responses from the guys
than from the girls.

00:35:46.430 --> 00:35:51.120
So the way to try to mitigate
that imbalance is to give

00:35:51.120 --> 00:35:53.980
people, first, a safe setting
for asking questions.

00:35:53.980 --> 00:35:56.880
And then people actually
calibrate to the correct level

00:35:56.880 --> 00:35:58.940
about, well, is this
a reasonable idea?

00:35:58.940 --> 00:35:59.900
Is this not a reasonable idea?

00:35:59.900 --> 00:36:02.410
Could the people around me
have good ideas about it?

00:36:02.410 --> 00:36:03.400
Is it resolved now?

00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:03.520
If

00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:06.190
Not, well, it's probably safe to
raise in a bigger setting.

00:36:06.190 --> 00:36:08.730
So you'll actually fix the
gender imbalance to a large

00:36:08.730 --> 00:36:11.220
extent, and balance it out.

00:36:11.220 --> 00:36:12.650
So it has lots of benefits
that you get

00:36:12.650 --> 00:36:14.110
from tutorial teaching.

00:36:14.110 --> 00:36:18.360
So now I'll show you the last
one, which we won't actually

00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:19.610
do for half an hour.

00:36:22.220 --> 00:36:25.580
But I want to sketch out how
you could do a question for

00:36:25.580 --> 00:36:26.720
half an hour.

00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:28.940
I'll show you the kind of
question that works in that

00:36:28.940 --> 00:36:30.880
time frame.

00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:32.840
So this could be multiple
choice.

00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:35.405
Doesn't have to be, but some
kind of conceptual question

00:36:35.405 --> 00:36:37.760
with lots of discussion.

00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:41.390
And often, it may have
a demonstration.

00:36:41.390 --> 00:36:44.190
So let me show you that
particular question.

00:36:44.190 --> 00:36:45.235
So I'm going to use--

00:36:45.235 --> 00:36:47.480
I have these guys too, but I
also have the wood blocks

00:36:47.480 --> 00:36:49.240
which I like so much.

00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:54.850
So here are two wood blocks cut
for me by the machine shop

00:36:54.850 --> 00:36:56.470
of the Cambridge physics
department

00:36:56.470 --> 00:36:57.390
when I taught there.

00:36:57.390 --> 00:37:01.280
So they cut them out of the
same piece of pine, same

00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:02.450
grain, direction, everything.

00:37:02.450 --> 00:37:04.850
The only difference is this is
2 centimeters thick, and

00:37:04.850 --> 00:37:05.980
that's 1 centimeter thick.

00:37:05.980 --> 00:37:09.850
But They're both a foot long
and 5 centimeters wide.

00:37:09.850 --> 00:37:15.332
So what I'm going to do is I'm
going to tap this block, and

00:37:15.332 --> 00:37:16.511
you'll hear a note.

00:37:16.511 --> 00:37:19.810
[TAPS A NOTE ON WOOD BLOCK]

00:37:19.810 --> 00:37:21.060
PROFESSOR: Did everyone
hear the note?

00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:21.630
Great.

00:37:21.630 --> 00:37:24.880
OK, so now the question is, when
I tap this block, is the

00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:28.780
note going to be higher, the
same frequency, or lower?

00:37:31.290 --> 00:37:34.210
OK, so does everyone understand
the question?

00:37:38.210 --> 00:37:42.390
OK, so discuss with
your neighbors.

00:37:42.390 --> 00:37:44.820
We'll take a vote in about
a couple minutes.

00:37:44.820 --> 00:37:47.460
I won't give you the 10 minutes
I would normally give

00:37:47.460 --> 00:37:49.560
people to discuss and argue.

00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:51.355
We'll take a couple reasons,
then we'll do the experiment.

00:37:55.400 --> 00:38:02.010
OK, time to vote.

00:38:02.010 --> 00:38:06.680
So, just to sketch out how this
could actually turn into

00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:11.120
a 30-minute question, normally I
give students about a couple

00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:15.640
minutes to think on their own,
then take a vote, and then set

00:38:15.640 --> 00:38:17.310
everyone to argue
with each other.

00:38:17.310 --> 00:38:20.220
I say, in particular, find
someone who has a different

00:38:20.220 --> 00:38:24.280
answer than you, and try to
convince them of your answer.

00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:26.500
So then you get a big
argument going.

00:38:26.500 --> 00:38:29.960
And so then I let that go
for about 10 minutes.

00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:31.510
And then we take another vote.

00:38:31.510 --> 00:38:32.460
And then we discuss.

00:38:32.460 --> 00:38:35.000
So let's just imagine we've
skipped forward to the end of

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:37.670
the group discussion,
and we're going to

00:38:37.670 --> 00:38:39.120
take the second vote.

00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:43.500
So who thinks the thick block
will have a higher frequency

00:38:43.500 --> 00:38:44.750
than the thin block?

00:38:48.110 --> 00:38:52.110
About maybe 20 people.

00:38:52.110 --> 00:38:55.138
Who thinks they'll be equal?

00:38:55.138 --> 00:38:58.990
About 25.

00:38:58.990 --> 00:39:03.140
Who thinks the thick block will
have a lower frequency?

00:39:03.140 --> 00:39:05.740
About 50.

00:39:05.740 --> 00:39:09.620
OK, so we have a good spread
of opinion there.

00:39:09.620 --> 00:39:14.000
So now, again, in the scenario
of the 30-minute question, I

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:18.580
would ask for reasons, just like
I did here, and I would

00:39:18.580 --> 00:39:20.330
just be the scribe.

00:39:20.330 --> 00:39:22.720
I would just write down people's
reasons for A, B, or

00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:25.360
C, for greater, equal,
or less than.

00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:26.935
Just make sure I understand
the reason and

00:39:26.935 --> 00:39:27.780
then write it down.

00:39:27.780 --> 00:39:28.930
I don't have to agree
with the reason.

00:39:28.930 --> 00:39:31.300
Just make sure I understand it,
and the person who says it

00:39:31.300 --> 00:39:32.970
says, yeah, that's what
I'm trying to say.

00:39:32.970 --> 00:39:34.870
Write it on the board.

00:39:34.870 --> 00:39:37.420
Then give people the opportunity
to say a reason

00:39:37.420 --> 00:39:40.110
for any of the others or
against any of them, or

00:39:40.110 --> 00:39:42.900
comment on any reason already
on the board.

00:39:42.900 --> 00:39:45.400
And that can go for another
10 minutes or so,

00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:46.890
sometimes even longer.

00:39:46.890 --> 00:39:51.660
And then I ask people, OK, the
test of science is experiment.

00:39:51.660 --> 00:39:54.170
Should we do the experiment?

00:39:54.170 --> 00:39:55.260
Should we do the experiment?

00:39:55.260 --> 00:39:55.790
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:39:55.790 --> 00:39:56.340
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:39:56.340 --> 00:39:58.620
So just to remind you
of the earlier tone.

00:40:02.113 --> 00:40:10.596
[TAPS A NOTE ON WOOD BLOCK]

00:40:10.596 --> 00:40:11.594
[TAPS A HIGHER NOTE
ON WOOD BLOCK]

00:40:11.594 --> 00:40:14.300
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:15.850
PROFESSOR: So the
ayes have it.

00:40:20.130 --> 00:40:24.250
OK, so it turns out to be
roughly almost a factor of two

00:40:24.250 --> 00:40:26.450
higher in frequency, almost
a full octave.

00:40:26.450 --> 00:40:26.990
It's not quite.

00:40:26.990 --> 00:40:29.750
If they were infinitely thin,
and this were twice infinitely

00:40:29.750 --> 00:40:32.850
thin, it would be exactly
a factor of two.

00:40:32.850 --> 00:40:34.630
But because they have
a finite thickness,

00:40:34.630 --> 00:40:35.910
it's not quite true.

00:40:35.910 --> 00:40:37.380
But that's how xylophones
work.

00:40:37.380 --> 00:40:39.850
In fact, many people have
reasoned their way to the

00:40:39.850 --> 00:40:41.655
correct answer by thinking
about xylophones.

00:40:44.420 --> 00:40:46.980
And many people have reasoned
their way to the incorrect

00:40:46.980 --> 00:40:49.830
answer by thinking about guitar
strings, which brings

00:40:49.830 --> 00:40:52.710
up a very interesting discussion
you can have.

00:40:52.710 --> 00:40:57.350
So what did you notice
about here?

00:40:57.350 --> 00:41:00.725
When I was about to tap
the second one, could

00:41:00.725 --> 00:41:02.060
you hear a pin drop?

00:41:02.060 --> 00:41:03.500
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:03.500 --> 00:41:03.710
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:41:03.710 --> 00:41:06.100
Student engagement
is much higher,

00:41:06.100 --> 00:41:07.410
because people are involved.

00:41:07.410 --> 00:41:12.680
But the act of voting commits
people to a public view.

00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:16.030
And they want to know, is this
right or is this not right?

00:41:16.030 --> 00:41:19.820
And the act of voting has
another benefit, which is that

00:41:19.820 --> 00:41:21.910
you get a much better
error signal.

00:41:21.910 --> 00:41:23.500
Whereas, suppose you
didn't vote.

00:41:23.500 --> 00:41:25.560
And suppose you thought, well,
it could be higher because

00:41:25.560 --> 00:41:26.120
it's stiffer.

00:41:26.120 --> 00:41:29.110
On the other hand, it's bigger
wavelengths, so it's lower.

00:41:29.110 --> 00:41:30.740
And you sort of both reasons
in your head.

00:41:30.740 --> 00:41:32.440
You're in a superposition
state.

00:41:32.440 --> 00:41:34.670
And then the experiment
happens--

00:41:34.670 --> 00:41:37.040
bing bing bing-- and it's
higher, and you say, oh yeah,

00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:37.680
I knew that.

00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:41.910
It was higher because it's
thicker and stiffer.

00:41:41.910 --> 00:41:44.400
So you think actually you
understood everything, but you

00:41:44.400 --> 00:41:46.490
didn't actually figure out,
well, which of these two

00:41:46.490 --> 00:41:48.100
reasons is right and why?

00:41:48.100 --> 00:41:51.130
Whereas if you have to publicly
commit to one answer,

00:41:51.130 --> 00:41:54.830
then you get a clearly defined
signal back about whether that

00:41:54.830 --> 00:41:55.870
answer was right or not.

00:41:55.870 --> 00:41:58.480
So it's very important to
make sure people vote.

00:41:58.480 --> 00:42:00.840
And at the same time, it's very
important to make sure

00:42:00.840 --> 00:42:03.450
people are not punished
for voting.

00:42:03.450 --> 00:42:05.920
So does it matter in my classes
whether people get the

00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:06.890
vote right or not?

00:42:06.890 --> 00:42:08.140
I just want them to vote.

00:42:08.140 --> 00:42:10.370
And so then I have to give my
speech about, it's better to

00:42:10.370 --> 00:42:11.360
be wrong than right.

00:42:11.360 --> 00:42:12.331
Question?

00:42:12.331 --> 00:42:15.522
AUDIENCE: So I've been in lots
of classes where the professor

00:42:15.522 --> 00:42:17.732
asks a question and waits a
few seconds for people to

00:42:17.732 --> 00:42:18.714
raise their hands.

00:42:18.714 --> 00:42:23.296
And by the time he's done or
she's done, there's a third of

00:42:23.296 --> 00:42:26.324
the class raising their hand,
and those the people who had

00:42:26.324 --> 00:42:27.552
their hands up first.

00:42:27.552 --> 00:42:31.990
So how do you actually
take that step?

00:42:31.990 --> 00:42:33.710
PROFESSOR: Sorry, could you tell
me what they're doing?

00:42:33.710 --> 00:42:35.210
They ask a question.

00:42:35.210 --> 00:42:35.780
AUDIENCE: They ask
a question--

00:42:35.780 --> 00:42:38.662
PROFESSOR: Do they let the
whole class discuss it?

00:42:38.662 --> 00:42:40.060
AUDIENCE: Not necessarily.

00:42:40.060 --> 00:42:42.390
So that's what you're
saying is key here?

00:42:42.390 --> 00:42:43.960
PROFESSOR: Yeah, it's
really key to let

00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:45.440
the whole class discuss--

00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:48.830
so the normal structure for a
long question like this one

00:42:48.830 --> 00:42:51.360
I'll do is I'll make
sure everyone

00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:52.630
understands the question.

00:42:52.630 --> 00:42:55.820
And then I'll let people think
by themselves for a minute or

00:42:55.820 --> 00:42:59.370
two, and take a vote after that,
a straw poll, I call it,

00:42:59.370 --> 00:43:02.020
so people don't feel
it's too weighty.

00:43:02.020 --> 00:43:03.790
The reason for that is
that people have

00:43:03.790 --> 00:43:05.320
different learning styles.

00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:08.430
And some people want to think
longer for themself, and some

00:43:08.430 --> 00:43:10.260
people want to just start
talking right away, so I want

00:43:10.260 --> 00:43:12.480
to give something
for everybody.

00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:15.450
And then after I take that vote,
that gives me an idea

00:43:15.450 --> 00:43:18.090
where the class is, and it gives
the class an idea of

00:43:18.090 --> 00:43:20.150
where they are, and who
has different views.

00:43:20.150 --> 00:43:22.710
And then they can start arguing
with each other.

00:43:22.710 --> 00:43:25.310
And so now they've had a lot of
time to actually check what

00:43:25.310 --> 00:43:26.210
they all think.

00:43:26.210 --> 00:43:29.060
So people will have had
arguments in their group that

00:43:29.060 --> 00:43:31.350
they can't resolve, so they're
very eager to actually share

00:43:31.350 --> 00:43:32.590
the argument.

00:43:32.590 --> 00:43:35.090
Whereas if you just ask the
question without giving people

00:43:35.090 --> 00:43:39.460
time to struggle with it, you're
basically wasting the

00:43:39.460 --> 00:43:40.811
effect of the question.

00:43:40.811 --> 00:43:44.248
AUDIENCE: So how do you decide
what level of difficulty for

00:43:44.248 --> 00:43:45.498
discussion?

00:43:47.880 --> 00:43:49.210
PROFESSOR: This is
a hard question.

00:43:49.210 --> 00:43:50.280
But it's so rich.

00:43:50.280 --> 00:43:52.670
It has so many things.

00:43:52.670 --> 00:43:55.100
I don't expect most people to
get the question right.

00:43:55.100 --> 00:43:57.780
In fact, when I ask this to
faculty in physics department,

00:43:57.780 --> 00:43:59.630
when I give physics teaching
seminars, most

00:43:59.630 --> 00:44:00.880
people get it wrong.

00:44:04.010 --> 00:44:06.690
I won't say all the places where
that's been true, but

00:44:06.690 --> 00:44:09.440
it's been at many universities
around the world.

00:44:09.440 --> 00:44:11.810
So I don't expect
people to get it

00:44:11.810 --> 00:44:13.050
right, and I don't care.

00:44:13.050 --> 00:44:16.330
The reason for it is that it
introduces so many ideas--

00:44:16.330 --> 00:44:18.830
about, for example, spring
models of solids.

00:44:18.830 --> 00:44:21.470
We can use musical instruments
as analogies--

00:44:21.470 --> 00:44:23.050
that I think it's worth
spending even a

00:44:23.050 --> 00:44:24.370
whole class on it.

00:44:24.370 --> 00:44:28.840
And in fact, one time somebody
said, well, but a xylophone,

00:44:28.840 --> 00:44:30.430
all the things are the
same thickness and

00:44:30.430 --> 00:44:31.230
they're just longer.

00:44:31.230 --> 00:44:32.460
How does that work?

00:44:32.460 --> 00:44:33.880
And I said, oh, I'm glad
you asked that.

00:44:33.880 --> 00:44:35.610
And I pulled out my daughter's
xylophone--

00:44:35.610 --> 00:44:36.900
she has a baby xylophone--

00:44:36.900 --> 00:44:38.060
from my backpack.

00:44:38.060 --> 00:44:40.410
And so we analyzed the xylophone
right there.

00:44:40.410 --> 00:44:42.580
So it leads to so many
interesting things that I'm

00:44:42.580 --> 00:44:44.600
willing to spend a whole
class on it.

00:44:44.600 --> 00:44:46.080
So that's how I decide
how much time

00:44:46.080 --> 00:44:48.100
to allocate to something.

00:44:48.100 --> 00:44:51.340
If it's a really core idea,
spend more time on it.

00:44:51.340 --> 00:44:53.910
And if it's peripheral, tend to
spend less time on it or do

00:44:53.910 --> 00:44:58.270
a really short question
on it, if at all.

00:44:58.270 --> 00:44:59.450
And then the difficulty--

00:44:59.450 --> 00:45:01.500
I like to get questions,
ideally--

00:45:01.500 --> 00:45:03.480
I mean, this one's different
just because it's so rich--

00:45:03.480 --> 00:45:08.670
but ideally where students are
sort of at 60% correct

00:45:08.670 --> 00:45:12.510
thinking by themself,
maybe 65%, even 70%.

00:45:12.510 --> 00:45:15.295
Because even though they may be
right, that sounds like oh,

00:45:15.295 --> 00:45:16.410
they're mostly fine,
but they may not

00:45:16.410 --> 00:45:17.610
know why they're right.

00:45:17.610 --> 00:45:21.290
So then in the discussion they
can solidify their reasons and

00:45:21.290 --> 00:45:22.840
maybe get up to 80% or 90%.

00:45:22.840 --> 00:45:24.900
Whereas if you've got a question
where they're 30%

00:45:24.900 --> 00:45:27.400
correct to start with, and
that doesn't have other

00:45:27.400 --> 00:45:29.830
redeeming qualities like the
richness of it, you'll just

00:45:29.830 --> 00:45:33.540
propagate noise throughout the
system, and just basically

00:45:33.540 --> 00:45:35.650
wrong ideas will just spread all
over and you'll spend all

00:45:35.650 --> 00:45:37.220
your time correcting those.

00:45:37.220 --> 00:45:39.280
So I gauge the difficulty
based on

00:45:39.280 --> 00:45:42.300
trying to hit that mark.

00:45:42.300 --> 00:45:47.590
OK, so hopefully you've
seen, first of all,

00:45:47.590 --> 00:45:49.470
that tutorial teaching--

00:45:49.470 --> 00:45:50.890
the main points from today--

00:45:50.890 --> 00:45:53.490
is much more effective than
regular teaching as normally

00:45:53.490 --> 00:45:55.900
practiced because of these
characteristics--

00:45:55.900 --> 00:45:59.045
generally questioning, feedback,
instant feedback and

00:45:59.045 --> 00:46:00.940
corrective feedback
right away.

00:46:00.940 --> 00:46:03.770
But through a series of methods,
you can bring many of

00:46:03.770 --> 00:46:06.720
the benefits of tutorial
teaching to your own large

00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:09.540
group teaching, which is the
kind of teaching that most of

00:46:09.540 --> 00:46:11.270
us will do, just for
cost reasons.

00:46:11.270 --> 00:46:13.730
So I wish you best of luck
in all your teaching.

00:46:13.730 --> 00:46:15.690
AUDIENCE: Can I just [? get ?]
one interesting statement?

00:46:15.690 --> 00:46:15.990
PROFESSOR: Sure.

00:46:15.990 --> 00:46:19.420
AUDIENCE: It's something to
think about, and faculty often

00:46:19.420 --> 00:46:20.890
have difficulty with this.

00:46:20.890 --> 00:46:24.888
There's probably a pretty high
correlation between the amount

00:46:24.888 --> 00:46:28.578
of information that you want
to get through to students,

00:46:28.578 --> 00:46:33.340
and the time that it
takes to do it.

00:46:33.340 --> 00:46:36.630
The more questions you ask, the
less you can get through

00:46:36.630 --> 00:46:37.420
the material.

00:46:37.420 --> 00:46:39.240
And this constant
questioning--

00:46:39.240 --> 00:46:40.210
PROFESSOR: This constant
battle.

00:46:40.210 --> 00:46:40.665
AUDIENCE: What should I do?

00:46:40.665 --> 00:46:43.850
Should I just try to get this
much information because I

00:46:43.850 --> 00:46:45.470
want to ask lots of questions?

00:46:45.470 --> 00:46:49.240
Or do I want to get that much
information through, then I

00:46:49.240 --> 00:46:51.590
better not spend too much
time asking questions?

00:46:51.590 --> 00:46:52.910
It's a conundrum.

00:46:52.910 --> 00:46:55.280
I think asking questions is
just a phenomenal way of

00:46:55.280 --> 00:46:57.240
learning, but [INAUDIBLE].

00:46:57.240 --> 00:47:00.300
PROFESSOR: Yeah, basically
we teach too much stuff.

00:47:00.300 --> 00:47:01.860
And that's the fundamental
problem.

00:47:01.860 --> 00:47:05.380
And so one solution to that is
to say, look, all the details,

00:47:05.380 --> 00:47:06.660
get it from a book.

00:47:06.660 --> 00:47:10.380
And in class, we're going to
do what you can't easily do

00:47:10.380 --> 00:47:14.200
from the book, which is
struggle, argue, reason, and

00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:15.110
correct those reasons.

00:47:15.110 --> 00:47:16.520
That's hard to do from a book.

00:47:16.520 --> 00:47:18.610
So you should use the class
time for something that's

00:47:18.610 --> 00:47:20.610
value added that you
can't do elsewhere.

00:47:20.610 --> 00:47:22.380
So good luck with that.

00:47:22.380 --> 00:47:24.540
Please take a minute to fill
out the feedback sheets.

00:47:24.540 --> 00:47:27.420
And as long as no one kicks us
out, I'll be here as long as

00:47:27.420 --> 00:47:30.690
people have questions.

00:47:30.690 --> 00:47:31.240
[? COMPUTER: Answers ?]

00:47:31.240 --> 00:47:33.090
from lecture seven to questions

00:47:33.090 --> 00:47:37.130
generated in lecture six.

00:47:37.130 --> 00:47:43.020
PROFESSOR: OK, so questions
from before.

00:47:43.020 --> 00:47:46.660
What are your suggestions for
someone teaching a course that

00:47:46.660 --> 00:47:50.570
they are not expert in at all,
you know, for the first time?

00:47:50.570 --> 00:47:52.450
So I'm a practical man.

00:47:52.450 --> 00:47:54.540
I know most people, when they're
teaching a course,

00:47:54.540 --> 00:47:57.210
teaching is not going
to be their life.

00:47:57.210 --> 00:48:00.090
I mean, it is for me,
but that's unusual.

00:48:00.090 --> 00:48:03.710
And if you love teaching,
that's great.

00:48:03.710 --> 00:48:07.520
But probably, your job will be
dependent on how much research

00:48:07.520 --> 00:48:11.420
you do or other activities like
department committees.

00:48:11.420 --> 00:48:14.110
And so you don't want to destroy
your whole career on

00:48:14.110 --> 00:48:15.810
your first course.

00:48:15.810 --> 00:48:19.030
By which I mean, just try to
survive your first course.

00:48:19.030 --> 00:48:20.970
Because what you could do the
first time you're teaching

00:48:20.970 --> 00:48:22.300
it-- so the answer
is, you need to

00:48:22.300 --> 00:48:23.480
somehow become an expert.

00:48:23.480 --> 00:48:25.400
If you want to teach it
differently and creatively and

00:48:25.400 --> 00:48:29.740
interestingly, you somehow
need to become an expert.

00:48:29.740 --> 00:48:33.910
Now, you could do that by
spending the whole summer

00:48:33.910 --> 00:48:36.940
before really figuring out the
material from scratch.

00:48:36.940 --> 00:48:38.890
And that probably in the long
term is a good thing.

00:48:38.890 --> 00:48:40.990
You'd probably find useful
results in your

00:48:40.990 --> 00:48:41.910
research from it.

00:48:41.910 --> 00:48:44.790
But probably you don't have
that summer to do that.

00:48:44.790 --> 00:48:48.730
And so what you need to do is
kill two birds with one stone

00:48:48.730 --> 00:48:52.110
and become an expert by teaching
it, in which case the

00:48:52.110 --> 00:48:55.970
best plan I would recommend is
just to teach it pretty much

00:48:55.970 --> 00:48:58.030
the regular way, with some

00:48:58.030 --> 00:48:59.740
interactive changes in lecture.

00:48:59.740 --> 00:49:02.930
But just follow the regular
plan, as much as it sticks in

00:49:02.930 --> 00:49:03.830
one's craw.

00:49:03.830 --> 00:49:06.220
Because in doing that, first
of all, you will

00:49:06.220 --> 00:49:08.280
be rocking the boat.

00:49:08.280 --> 00:49:11.880
So people will accept it
even if it's not great.

00:49:11.880 --> 00:49:14.180
And you'll become an
expert by the end.

00:49:14.180 --> 00:49:16.720
And then the next time you
teach it, you'll be OK.

00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:19.530
Then you you've done that summer
of thinking, but you've

00:49:19.530 --> 00:49:21.390
done it during the class.

00:49:21.390 --> 00:49:23.740
So it meant the first class
didn't go as well as it could.

00:49:23.740 --> 00:49:26.240
But it also meant you survived
and you could order material

00:49:26.240 --> 00:49:27.640
for your lab and all the
other things that

00:49:27.640 --> 00:49:28.890
you'd do in the summer.

00:49:38.320 --> 00:49:39.300
How do you--

00:49:39.300 --> 00:49:41.790
so I like it when you emphasize
that it's OK to get

00:49:41.790 --> 00:49:42.965
the wrong answer.

00:49:42.965 --> 00:49:46.730
It's like with the wood blocks,
I mentioned how,

00:49:46.730 --> 00:49:50.300
mostly when I ask this of
physics professors too, people

00:49:50.300 --> 00:49:51.960
get it mostly wrong.

00:49:51.960 --> 00:49:54.750
And so I had another example of
that in Colorado, because I

00:49:54.750 --> 00:49:56.590
gave a talk using
the wood blocks.

00:49:56.590 --> 00:49:59.130
So how can you incorporate that
"it's OK to be wrong, as

00:49:59.130 --> 00:50:01.420
long as you learn" attitude
into class?

00:50:01.420 --> 00:50:04.500
One of the best ways is to
minimize the amount of

00:50:04.500 --> 00:50:07.840
grading, and the emphasis
given to grading.

00:50:07.840 --> 00:50:11.935
Grading, basically, as a
first approximation--

00:50:19.750 --> 00:50:27.470
so if I just add two letters,
it's hard to avoid that.

00:50:27.470 --> 00:50:30.850
So grading, when you mark
someone and you tell them,

00:50:30.850 --> 00:50:36.320
bad, A B, C, D, well, the people
who are getting B's,

00:50:36.320 --> 00:50:40.640
C's, and D's, whatever the quote
bad grades are, you are

00:50:40.640 --> 00:50:42.490
actually shaming people.

00:50:42.490 --> 00:50:45.210
And in some ways, you are
degrading their psyche.

00:50:45.210 --> 00:50:46.830
So it's not healthy.

00:50:46.830 --> 00:50:48.440
So that is one of the political
barriers to

00:50:48.440 --> 00:50:50.270
educational change
is the importance

00:50:50.270 --> 00:50:52.030
that we give to grading.

00:50:52.030 --> 00:50:55.040
And I will talk about that
in the final session.

00:50:55.040 --> 00:50:57.900
You may think, oh what about
the people who get A's?

00:50:57.900 --> 00:51:01.120
Well, if you're giving A,
B, C's, and D's, the

00:51:01.120 --> 00:51:02.810
people who get A's.

00:51:02.810 --> 00:51:07.760
They may have struggled and were
thinking, oh my god, will

00:51:07.760 --> 00:51:08.180
I get an A?

00:51:08.180 --> 00:51:09.140
Will I get an A?

00:51:09.140 --> 00:51:11.400
Then they get an A.
So they go, phew.

00:51:11.400 --> 00:51:14.180
But still, they were nervous
about their learning the whole

00:51:14.180 --> 00:51:16.980
time instead of enjoying it
as much as they could.

00:51:16.980 --> 00:51:20.410
And second, there's also
studies, many studies, which

00:51:20.410 --> 00:51:22.800
show that when you reward people
for things they already

00:51:22.800 --> 00:51:24.770
enjoy-- this is totally
fascinating--

00:51:24.770 --> 00:51:27.170
so when you reward people for
things they already enjoy

00:51:27.170 --> 00:51:30.360
doing, their enjoyment drops.

00:51:30.360 --> 00:51:32.830
So if you start paying people
for things that they would

00:51:32.830 --> 00:51:36.260
like doing anyway, then they
don't like it as much.

00:51:36.260 --> 00:51:38.390
And you [INAUDIBLE] everyday
examples of this.

00:51:38.390 --> 00:51:41.980
You know if you know anyone
who's a symphony orchestra

00:51:41.980 --> 00:51:44.770
player, they say, oh yeah, the
best way to start hating music

00:51:44.770 --> 00:51:46.990
is to be a professional
musician.

00:51:46.990 --> 00:51:50.770
They love music, and then they
had to do it for pay, in all

00:51:50.770 --> 00:51:52.580
of a sudden they don't like as
much anymore, not all of a

00:51:52.580 --> 00:51:53.760
sudden, but slowly.

00:51:53.760 --> 00:51:55.740
So there are many, many
studies about that--

00:51:55.740 --> 00:51:56.620
motivation.

00:51:56.620 --> 00:52:01.110
So what you want to do really
is to find intrinsic

00:52:01.110 --> 00:52:02.320
motivation.

00:52:02.320 --> 00:52:04.660
And so the difference between
extrinsic and intrinsic

00:52:04.660 --> 00:52:06.290
motivation is fundamental.

00:52:06.290 --> 00:52:09.280
And what you want to try to do
is create the environment

00:52:09.280 --> 00:52:11.450
always where the motivation
is intrinsic, so that the

00:52:11.450 --> 00:52:12.960
questions are interesting.

00:52:12.960 --> 00:52:16.530
So what that means is you
don't want to use bad

00:52:16.530 --> 00:52:18.890
questions that people don't have
an interest in, and then

00:52:18.890 --> 00:52:20.940
force them to be interested
because you give them

00:52:20.940 --> 00:52:22.210
extrinsic motivation.

00:52:22.210 --> 00:52:25.700
That's a fundamental bad choice,
and then it's being

00:52:25.700 --> 00:52:27.760
solved with the fundamental
wrong approach.

00:52:27.760 --> 00:52:30.280
What do you need to do is rather
than do both of those,

00:52:30.280 --> 00:52:32.000
you say, OK, let me find
interesting questions that

00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:33.200
people care about.

00:52:33.200 --> 00:52:35.690
And then the intrinsic
motivation carries people

00:52:35.690 --> 00:52:37.450
through, whether they're
right or wrong.

00:52:37.450 --> 00:52:39.960
So that's why I like questions
like the wood block so much,

00:52:39.960 --> 00:52:41.620
because people are just
actually interested.

00:52:41.620 --> 00:52:42.790
They want to know.

00:52:42.790 --> 00:52:44.010
They say, oh, that's
a good question.

00:52:44.010 --> 00:52:44.790
I should know that.

00:52:44.790 --> 00:52:45.540
Oh, maybe I don't.

00:52:45.540 --> 00:52:47.320
OK, well maybe I'll
learn something.

00:52:47.320 --> 00:52:50.140
So the other part of that is,
if you notice, I didn't use

00:52:50.140 --> 00:52:52.550
clickers when we did
this question.

00:52:52.550 --> 00:52:56.280
Partly, it's because clickers
are expensive and you have a

00:52:56.280 --> 00:52:59.220
bunch of logistics to do, and
then you need probably some

00:52:59.220 --> 00:53:02.660
ludicrous Windows program to
receive the signals, and I

00:53:02.660 --> 00:53:04.560
haven't written the Linux
version for it.

00:53:04.560 --> 00:53:06.210
So there's all of
those issues.

00:53:06.210 --> 00:53:09.430
Those are, I would say, not
the fundamental issue.

00:53:09.430 --> 00:53:11.360
The fundamental issue with
clickers, why I don't like

00:53:11.360 --> 00:53:17.610
them, is that they make people
think they're being spied on.

00:53:17.610 --> 00:53:20.240
So even especially if you live
in a surveillance society,

00:53:20.240 --> 00:53:23.850
where actually all your phone
calls are being spied on,

00:53:23.850 --> 00:53:26.790
people might think, well when
you have clickers, you're

00:53:26.790 --> 00:53:29.715
being spied on to know whether
you got the right answer or

00:53:29.715 --> 00:53:32.310
not, and it's going to count
against you at some point.

00:53:32.310 --> 00:53:35.520
So I'm very happy with people
to just raise their hands.

00:53:35.520 --> 00:53:39.320
And that's, in a way, more
anonymous than a clicker that

00:53:39.320 --> 00:53:40.650
belongs to you.

00:53:40.650 --> 00:53:42.470
So there are ways of getting
around that with clickers.

00:53:42.470 --> 00:53:44.880
You can to have people trade
clickers so they know that the

00:53:44.880 --> 00:53:45.670
clickers are random.

00:53:45.670 --> 00:53:47.290
So you can do things
like that.

00:53:47.290 --> 00:53:49.780
But still, I like the informal
feel of, yeah,

00:53:49.780 --> 00:53:50.670
just raise your hand.

00:53:50.670 --> 00:53:50.970
Don't worry.

00:53:50.970 --> 00:53:53.480
It's a safe space in
the classroom.

00:53:53.480 --> 00:53:55.160
And I have to say that
a few times.

00:53:55.160 --> 00:53:57.700
But just raise your hand,
and don't worry.

00:53:57.700 --> 00:53:58.630
And I'm not spying on you.

00:53:58.630 --> 00:54:01.160
I don't care whether you get
the right answer or not.

00:54:01.160 --> 00:54:03.770
For example, with the wood
blocks, I expect most people

00:54:03.770 --> 00:54:04.770
to get the wrong answer.

00:54:04.770 --> 00:54:06.260
That's OK.

00:54:06.260 --> 00:54:08.960
We'll learn something
about it afterwards.

00:54:08.960 --> 00:54:11.180
So you do have to work at it,
but there are things you can

00:54:11.180 --> 00:54:13.820
do to keep the class
[? safe. ?]

00:54:13.820 --> 00:54:16.920
There are also things to do,
which is that never--

00:54:16.920 --> 00:54:19.480
it's hard to remember how much
power you have as the

00:54:19.480 --> 00:54:24.380
instructor, and just
as someone in

00:54:24.380 --> 00:54:26.180
a position of authority.

00:54:26.180 --> 00:54:29.580
So I might have told you the
story from when I was a

00:54:29.580 --> 00:54:31.652
graduate student, but it's
worth telling again, if I

00:54:31.652 --> 00:54:34.600
haven't, which is that I was
giving a talk in a group

00:54:34.600 --> 00:54:36.030
meeting when I was a
graduate student.

00:54:36.030 --> 00:54:37.780
My adviser got frustrated
with me because I wasn't

00:54:37.780 --> 00:54:41.190
understanding some fundamental
point, actually about springs.

00:54:41.190 --> 00:54:44.500
So to demonstrate it, he kicked
the table at me and

00:54:44.500 --> 00:54:46.390
said, is this acting
like a spring?

00:54:46.390 --> 00:54:47.550
And I was so shocked.

00:54:47.550 --> 00:54:49.850
I was just mortified
for like two days.

00:54:49.850 --> 00:54:52.040
I just couldn't believe my
adviser had done that in front

00:54:52.040 --> 00:54:55.150
of everybody else, and thought
that I must be

00:54:55.150 --> 00:54:56.650
idiot and showed it.

00:54:56.650 --> 00:54:59.010
So then eventually my fellow
grad students said, well,

00:54:59.010 --> 00:55:01.610
actually he does that only
when you really cares.

00:55:01.610 --> 00:55:04.580
So that's better than people
just switching off.

00:55:04.580 --> 00:55:06.880
So I sort of consoled
myself with that.

00:55:06.880 --> 00:55:10.240
But it did make a real strong
impression on me, how much

00:55:10.240 --> 00:55:13.960
even a small push from someone
in authority can do.

00:55:13.960 --> 00:55:18.330
So it's the same thing in
lecture, if when someone says

00:55:18.330 --> 00:55:22.560
something wrong, if you
say, oh, why would

00:55:22.560 --> 00:55:23.600
you have said that?

00:55:23.600 --> 00:55:26.810
Even the slightest hint of that,
people magnify and will

00:55:26.810 --> 00:55:28.680
pick up and be very,
very sensitive to.

00:55:28.680 --> 00:55:32.350
So you have to be really,
really, really careful not to

00:55:32.350 --> 00:55:33.830
let that happen.

00:55:33.830 --> 00:55:36.200
So one way is the poker face.

00:55:36.200 --> 00:55:37.740
So I practiced the poker face.

00:55:37.740 --> 00:55:40.480
So when people are making
suggestions, for example,

00:55:40.480 --> 00:55:43.620
about the wood block, why they
would act one way or another,

00:55:43.620 --> 00:55:46.840
I just make sure I get in a
different mental state.

00:55:46.840 --> 00:55:49.250
The mental state is
transcription.

00:55:49.250 --> 00:55:50.930
So I just want to make
sure I understand

00:55:50.930 --> 00:55:52.420
what people are saying.

00:55:52.420 --> 00:55:54.340
And then I just write
that down.

00:55:54.340 --> 00:55:56.150
Now, it's even there you
have to be careful.

00:55:56.150 --> 00:55:59.040
Because you'll understand the
correct answer quicker than

00:55:59.040 --> 00:56:01.120
you will the incorrect answer.

00:56:01.120 --> 00:56:02.690
So you have to make sure when
people are explaining the

00:56:02.690 --> 00:56:05.010
correct answer, you don't
complete it for them.

00:56:05.010 --> 00:56:07.600
And then in contrast, when
people are explaining a wrong

00:56:07.600 --> 00:56:09.710
answer, you ask lots of
questions, because

00:56:09.710 --> 00:56:10.980
that too is a signal.

00:56:10.980 --> 00:56:15.970
So the poker face is tricky to
do, but once you master it,

00:56:15.970 --> 00:56:18.920
that's one good way of giving
yourself a pause and not

00:56:18.920 --> 00:56:21.680
criticizing people for
their answers.

00:56:21.680 --> 00:56:24.020
So there are various ways, but
you just have to be careful.

00:56:24.020 --> 00:56:27.170
And if you do that regularly,
you'll find in a week or two,

00:56:27.170 --> 00:56:30.240
you've overcome the presumption
people have that

00:56:30.240 --> 00:56:32.440
it's dangerous to
ask questions.

00:56:32.440 --> 00:56:33.690
But you do have to work at it.

00:56:37.220 --> 00:56:39.470
Is it possible to incorporate
mastery learning at the

00:56:39.470 --> 00:56:40.500
college level?

00:56:40.500 --> 00:56:41.850
So actually, there is
a very interesting

00:56:41.850 --> 00:56:42.850
experiment on that.

00:56:42.850 --> 00:56:46.350
And it was done at MIT in
the 1970s, I believe.

00:56:46.350 --> 00:56:47.600
It was called--

00:57:00.080 --> 00:57:01.800
so it was called the
Keller Plan.

00:57:06.450 --> 00:57:08.100
I don't know if they did it
for all courses, but the

00:57:08.100 --> 00:57:10.860
physics courses were
taught this way.

00:57:10.860 --> 00:57:14.150
I don't know if only that way,
or that was an option.

00:57:14.150 --> 00:57:19.380
So it was in the 1970s,
which was a time of--

00:57:19.380 --> 00:57:21.390
as people who were here
then said, it was a

00:57:21.390 --> 00:57:23.440
very turbulent time.

00:57:23.440 --> 00:57:26.780
And the turbulence actually
enabled lots of educational

00:57:26.780 --> 00:57:30.550
experiments to happen, basically
the '60s and '70s.

00:57:30.550 --> 00:57:33.610
So if you look at, for example,
the Feynman lectures

00:57:33.610 --> 00:57:37.000
were in Caltech in the '60s, the
Berkeley physics course,

00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:41.310
1960s, things like the Keller
Plan, the free schools at the

00:57:41.310 --> 00:57:42.520
school level--

00:57:42.520 --> 00:57:45.420
tons of experiments happened
in the '60s and '70s.

00:57:45.420 --> 00:57:46.540
So the Keller Plan
was one of them.

00:57:46.540 --> 00:57:47.410
It was mastery learning.

00:57:47.410 --> 00:57:49.630
Students worked on problems, and
when they were ready for

00:57:49.630 --> 00:57:52.100
the next piece, they
continued.

00:57:52.100 --> 00:57:55.320
And from what I can tell,
it worked pretty well.

00:57:55.320 --> 00:57:59.700
But then eventually it got
killed off by basically

00:57:59.700 --> 00:58:02.700
faculty who said, no, I'd rather
teach and do lectures.

00:58:02.700 --> 00:58:07.290
Because what's the point of the
faculty if the students

00:58:07.290 --> 00:58:09.460
can learn really well
from the books?

00:58:09.460 --> 00:58:13.710
So I think the Keller Plan
was a really good idea.

00:58:13.710 --> 00:58:18.680
In school, I learned for five
years of high school math in

00:58:18.680 --> 00:58:21.740
three or four weeks using the
Keller Plan, compared to the

00:58:21.740 --> 00:58:24.150
normal pace in school where you
spend a whole year doing

00:58:24.150 --> 00:58:25.240
trigonometry.

00:58:25.240 --> 00:58:27.600
So the Keller Plan is a really,
really excellent way,

00:58:27.600 --> 00:58:29.760
if you have reasonable books.

00:58:29.760 --> 00:58:32.850
So now, what are the full
reasons it died?

00:58:32.850 --> 00:58:33.630
I'm not really sure.

00:58:33.630 --> 00:58:35.190
I need to check into that.

00:58:35.190 --> 00:58:38.140
But people who were around then,
some of them said, yeah,

00:58:38.140 --> 00:58:41.560
just people who wanted to
perform in lecture were really

00:58:41.560 --> 00:58:44.010
sad about the Keller Plan
and wanted to go

00:58:44.010 --> 00:58:45.930
back to the old way.

00:58:45.930 --> 00:58:48.320
And so when the political
currents changed, so did the

00:58:48.320 --> 00:58:49.570
Keller Plan.

00:58:51.640 --> 00:58:54.560
How do I come up with these rich
and interesting examples

00:58:54.560 --> 00:58:56.600
like the wood blocks,
and how often do

00:58:56.600 --> 00:58:57.890
you incorporate demos?

00:58:57.890 --> 00:59:00.650
Well, we'll talk about that
in Walter Lewin's lecture.

00:59:00.650 --> 00:59:02.920
So if you saw Walter Lewin's
lecture, the one on the

00:59:02.920 --> 00:59:05.870
pendulum, he must have had
four or five different

00:59:05.870 --> 00:59:07.980
demonstrations.

00:59:07.980 --> 00:59:11.250
They were short, but he had
many demonstrations.

00:59:11.250 --> 00:59:15.030
And questions like this, if I
had 20 of these, I would use

00:59:15.030 --> 00:59:17.210
20 different ones.

00:59:17.210 --> 00:59:22.360
So usually I have four or five
of them that are a good long

00:59:22.360 --> 00:59:24.780
time demo that are suitable
for, say, half

00:59:24.780 --> 00:59:25.860
a lecture or longer.

00:59:25.860 --> 00:59:26.550
And I use them.

00:59:26.550 --> 00:59:28.660
So wherever I can find
them, I use them.

00:59:28.660 --> 00:59:32.110
But not every single demo is
worth spending 30 to 40

00:59:32.110 --> 00:59:32.590
minutes on.

00:59:32.590 --> 00:59:35.780
So you have to think about
whether it teaches core ideas,

00:59:35.780 --> 00:59:39.900
how it fits with the goals
of your course.

00:59:39.900 --> 00:59:43.560
So for example, let me talk
through why I use this one.

00:59:43.560 --> 00:59:46.450
Well, one of the goals that I
want is I want students to be

00:59:46.450 --> 00:59:48.870
able to make physical
models themself.

00:59:48.870 --> 00:59:51.270
I don't want them to just be
able to solve equations that

00:59:51.270 --> 00:59:52.220
I've put in front of them.

00:59:52.220 --> 00:59:55.000
So normally what you do is you'd
teach them the bending

00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:57.640
beam equation, and then maybe
you'd show them this, and then

00:59:57.640 --> 00:59:59.120
you'd do this in two
or three minutes.

00:59:59.120 --> 01:00:01.510
But actually a much more
interesting question is not,

01:00:01.510 --> 01:00:03.580
what's the solution to the
bending beam equation when the

01:00:03.580 --> 01:00:05.060
beam's twice as thick.

01:00:05.060 --> 01:00:08.970
The question is, what physical
model is responsible for

01:00:08.970 --> 01:00:09.820
making sound?

01:00:09.820 --> 01:00:12.180
When you hear sound, where
is it coming from?

01:00:12.180 --> 01:00:15.000
When you tap this guy--

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.380
[TAPS A NOTE ON WOOD BLOCK]--
why is it making sound, long

01:00:17.380 --> 01:00:19.830
before you're even discussing
the bending beam equation.

01:00:19.830 --> 01:00:22.330
So that question is, to my mind,
much more interesting.

01:00:22.330 --> 01:00:25.590
And so I'm very willing to spend
more time on that, and

01:00:25.590 --> 01:00:28.940
having students develop that
feel, and have them argue and

01:00:28.940 --> 01:00:30.730
realize that there's different
physical models.

01:00:30.730 --> 01:00:32.890
It could be a standing
wave in the block.

01:00:32.890 --> 01:00:34.650
It could be that the
block is bending.

01:00:34.650 --> 01:00:36.990
How do you decide, and how do
you decide which one you're

01:00:36.990 --> 01:00:38.050
going to hear more?

01:00:38.050 --> 01:00:40.450
And then for each one, how
do you figure out how the

01:00:40.450 --> 01:00:42.090
frequency's going to change?

01:00:42.090 --> 01:00:45.620
So that, because it fits so well
with the course goals,

01:00:45.620 --> 01:00:47.176
spend more time on it.

01:00:51.550 --> 01:00:55.590
Why is the stiffness a factor
of eight bigger?

01:00:55.590 --> 01:00:58.560
So that one, anyone who
wants to know, I will

01:00:58.560 --> 01:01:00.110
explain after lecture.

01:01:00.110 --> 01:01:03.030
Just come to office hours.

01:01:03.030 --> 01:01:06.850
So there's a simple picture
using wood atoms.

01:01:06.850 --> 01:01:08.100
Don't ask what wood atoms are.

01:01:13.350 --> 01:01:16.100
How can you incorporate aspects
of mastery learning

01:01:16.100 --> 01:01:17.620
into regular teaching?

01:01:17.620 --> 01:01:20.800
Ah, so that's what interactive
teaching is all about.

01:01:20.800 --> 01:01:24.590
So the reason mastery learning
works so well is that you're

01:01:24.590 --> 01:01:27.330
not building castles
of knowledge on

01:01:27.330 --> 01:01:30.740
sand, roughly speaking.

01:01:30.740 --> 01:01:34.410
So normally what happens-- so
the extreme case is Cambridge

01:01:34.410 --> 01:01:35.050
in England.

01:01:35.050 --> 01:01:37.700
So the teaching system there
is you have an eight-week

01:01:37.700 --> 01:01:40.810
term, and then you have a
six-week break, and then an

01:01:40.810 --> 01:01:43.990
eight-week term, six-week break,
eight-week term, and

01:01:43.990 --> 01:01:45.750
then 16-week break.

01:01:45.750 --> 01:01:50.120
So the eight-week term, about
what we would do in a semester

01:01:50.120 --> 01:01:53.300
is compressed into eight weeks,
just basically straight

01:01:53.300 --> 01:01:55.160
dictation and lecture.

01:01:55.160 --> 01:01:59.080
And the students have a hard
time really understanding

01:01:59.080 --> 01:02:01.750
everything at that pace, so
they just take dictation.

01:02:01.750 --> 01:02:03.830
And then you're supposed to
figure everything else out,

01:02:03.830 --> 01:02:06.540
integrate it in the
six-week break.

01:02:06.540 --> 01:02:10.130
So the problem with that is that
it's very inefficient.

01:02:10.130 --> 01:02:13.880
It's very inefficient because
you haven't understood A. And

01:02:13.880 --> 01:02:17.450
now B uses A, but A hasn't
really been understood.

01:02:17.450 --> 01:02:19.410
So you're not going to
understand B. So now you have

01:02:19.410 --> 01:02:21.310
A and B not really understood,
so you just write them down.

01:02:21.310 --> 01:02:23.870
Now C comes along using A and
B, but A and B aren't

01:02:23.870 --> 01:02:27.160
understood, so the problem
compounds.

01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:30.130
Whereas with mastery learning,
only when you understand A do

01:02:30.130 --> 01:02:33.660
you go onto B. And also when A
and B are solid, then you go

01:02:33.660 --> 01:02:37.780
onto C. So your knowledge
castles are robust and strong.

01:02:37.780 --> 01:02:40.440
And that's not true with
most teaching.

01:02:40.440 --> 01:02:42.760
So how do you remedy
that problem?

01:02:42.760 --> 01:02:44.740
Well one way is you ask
questions in lecture.

01:02:44.740 --> 01:02:48.730
So here, plan interactivity
and build

01:02:48.730 --> 01:02:49.980
it into your lecture.

01:02:59.430 --> 01:03:02.710
So by asking students questions
you figure out, oh,

01:03:02.710 --> 01:03:06.330
if only 20% or 30% or maybe even
40% of the students knew

01:03:06.330 --> 01:03:09.740
the correct answer, and even
after discussion, you think,

01:03:09.740 --> 01:03:11.790
oh, OK, well this is a
fundamental concept.

01:03:11.790 --> 01:03:13.940
Presumably that's why you asked
the question about it.

01:03:13.940 --> 01:03:15.380
But it wasn't mastered.

01:03:15.380 --> 01:03:18.380
So better fix it, before
you go on.

01:03:18.380 --> 01:03:20.540
So that builds mastery learning
into the regular

01:03:20.540 --> 01:03:22.140
lecturing process.

01:03:22.140 --> 01:03:23.740
And that's one reason
that interactive

01:03:23.740 --> 01:03:24.820
teaching is so effective.

01:03:24.820 --> 01:03:27.650
So one of the other questions
later in the sheets is, is

01:03:27.650 --> 01:03:29.810
there evidence that interactive
teaching is good

01:03:29.810 --> 01:03:31.150
and helps people learn?

01:03:31.150 --> 01:03:33.090
There is actually
good evidence.

01:03:33.090 --> 01:03:35.030
Maybe I should put some of
those papers online.

01:03:35.030 --> 01:03:37.690
One is by Richard Hake.

01:03:37.690 --> 01:03:38.740
He's now retired.

01:03:38.740 --> 01:03:40.800
He's physics professor from
Indiana University.

01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:47.090
So what he did is he did a
sample of physics courses

01:03:47.090 --> 01:03:49.880
across the country, intro
physics courses that included

01:03:49.880 --> 01:03:51.850
a total of 6,000 students.

01:03:51.850 --> 01:03:55.550
And he asked the instructors
to describe how they did

01:03:55.550 --> 01:03:55.980
everything.

01:03:55.980 --> 01:03:58.430
And then everything was
grouped into either

01:03:58.430 --> 01:04:00.770
interactive teaching or
regular teaching.

01:04:00.770 --> 01:04:04.880
And just the scores that
students got on one particular

01:04:04.880 --> 01:04:06.340
exam, which was a force concept

01:04:06.340 --> 01:04:08.010
inventory, before and after--

01:04:08.010 --> 01:04:09.860
they were given the force
concept inventory before the

01:04:09.860 --> 01:04:11.430
class started and at the end--

01:04:11.430 --> 01:04:14.070
they saw how much the
students improved.

01:04:14.070 --> 01:04:16.730
OK, so if you improved 100%--

01:04:16.730 --> 01:04:19.356
in other words, suppose you
started at 20% correct and you

01:04:19.356 --> 01:04:20.340
got to 100%--

01:04:20.340 --> 01:04:22.910
that was considered
a 1.0 gain.

01:04:22.910 --> 01:04:28.540
If you went from 20% percent
to 60%, that mean you got

01:04:28.540 --> 01:04:30.870
halfway to the maximum possible
score you could have

01:04:30.870 --> 01:04:32.600
gotten, so half of the maximum
improvement, that

01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:33.800
was a gain of 0.5.

01:04:33.800 --> 01:04:35.740
So he measured the gain
for everybody.

01:04:46.610 --> 01:04:53.660
So this is the gain on the
force concept inventory.

01:04:53.660 --> 01:04:56.640
And this is the number of
courses in each area.

01:04:56.640 --> 01:04:59.810
So it was roughly like that.

01:04:59.810 --> 01:05:03.060
So this was the regular.

01:05:03.060 --> 01:05:05.620
So the regular teaching, by the
way, included fantastic

01:05:05.620 --> 01:05:08.380
teachers, people who were rated
highest lecturer in the

01:05:08.380 --> 01:05:11.560
university and had won
lecturing awards.

01:05:11.560 --> 01:05:16.330
And the interactive teaching
was something like this.

01:05:16.330 --> 01:05:19.670
I'll put the paper online so you
can see the exact graph.

01:05:19.670 --> 01:05:22.840
But basically, the worst
interactive teaching was

01:05:22.840 --> 01:05:25.810
better than most of the
regular teaching.

01:05:25.810 --> 01:05:27.880
And the regular teaching
hardly got

01:05:27.880 --> 01:05:32.300
better than 0.2 or 0.3.

01:05:32.300 --> 01:05:34.810
So if you wanted any more gain
than that, you really needed

01:05:34.810 --> 01:05:36.220
to do interactive methods.

01:05:36.220 --> 01:05:38.860
And I think that is because
you've incorporated mastery

01:05:38.860 --> 01:05:40.130
learning into the curriculum.

01:05:44.320 --> 01:05:46.410
OK, what do you do when the
students are really quite and

01:05:46.410 --> 01:05:48.840
won't answer your questions?

01:05:48.840 --> 01:05:53.450
Or flip side is, what if only
the quote 5% usual suspects

01:05:53.450 --> 01:05:54.960
are the ones answering
the questions?

01:05:54.960 --> 01:05:56.160
What do you do?

01:05:56.160 --> 01:06:02.490
Well, so that is related to the
question of, are there bad

01:06:02.490 --> 01:06:04.710
ways of incorporating
interactivity?

01:06:04.710 --> 01:06:05.500
And there are.

01:06:05.500 --> 01:06:10.010
The worst is the following,
which is--

01:06:10.010 --> 01:06:11.260
I'll sort of parody it.

01:06:16.090 --> 01:06:19.470
So we're doing relativity,
or nuclear physics.

01:06:19.470 --> 01:06:22.160
E equals MC--

01:06:22.160 --> 01:06:24.660
[LAUGHTER]

01:06:24.660 --> 01:06:26.000
PROFESSOR: Squared, yeah.

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:27.020
OK.

01:06:27.020 --> 01:06:31.750
So you'll find a lot of people
who normally wouldn't teach

01:06:31.750 --> 01:06:35.310
interactively are now, they're
told or they hear that it's

01:06:35.310 --> 01:06:37.680
good to teach interactively and
ask students questions.

01:06:37.680 --> 01:06:40.670
But if you don't have any
practice in how to do that,

01:06:40.670 --> 01:06:43.850
the easiest questions to ask
are just things like this.

01:06:43.850 --> 01:06:46.520
And the problem with
that is not that

01:06:46.520 --> 01:06:47.830
they're asking a question.

01:06:47.830 --> 01:06:49.090
It's good to ask a question.

01:06:49.090 --> 01:06:54.000
But the problem is that this
thing, this two, is just a

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:54.980
memorized fact.

01:06:54.980 --> 01:06:58.170
So it's possible to answer it
just by memory, whereas if

01:06:58.170 --> 01:07:02.430
there was actually some debate
about what it should be, you

01:07:02.430 --> 01:07:04.350
could ask the students
the question.

01:07:04.350 --> 01:07:07.500
But now, if you just ask people
question like that, and

01:07:07.500 --> 01:07:09.710
you give people no time to
think, yes, you will get

01:07:09.710 --> 01:07:13.410
answers just from the quote top
5%, the usual suspects.

01:07:13.410 --> 01:07:16.340
So to avoid that, what you need
to do is give people a

01:07:16.340 --> 01:07:18.520
chance to think on their own.

01:07:18.520 --> 01:07:21.330
So that's one of the interactive
teaching

01:07:21.330 --> 01:07:24.060
techniques, the idea of give
people a minute or even 30

01:07:24.060 --> 01:07:28.140
seconds to think on their own,
so that you'll get answers

01:07:28.140 --> 01:07:30.200
from a wider spectrum of
people, because they've

01:07:30.200 --> 01:07:32.140
checked it out with
their neighbor.

01:07:32.140 --> 01:07:35.580
And they feel safer in
volunteering and answer or

01:07:35.580 --> 01:07:37.740
asking a question about it.

01:07:37.740 --> 01:07:41.250
So that's how you avoid two
things, two problems at once.

01:07:41.250 --> 01:07:43.670
You avoid the quiet students,
because you've given-- those

01:07:43.670 --> 01:07:45.450
students are being quiet because
you've given people a

01:07:45.450 --> 01:07:46.660
chance to think.

01:07:46.660 --> 01:07:50.550
And you also avoid the problem
of just the usual people

01:07:50.550 --> 01:07:51.460
answering, because you've given

01:07:51.460 --> 01:07:52.710
everybody a chance to think.

01:07:57.280 --> 01:08:01.150
OK, if we don't really
understand until we teach,

01:08:01.150 --> 01:08:03.890
should we have students teach
each other in presentations,

01:08:03.890 --> 01:08:07.090
or is that not worth the time?

01:08:07.090 --> 01:08:10.740
My feeling is that huge big
presentations and having

01:08:10.740 --> 01:08:14.540
students present to each other
is not so much worth the time.

01:08:14.540 --> 01:08:18.750
I mean, it's worth the time of
the one person who's doing the

01:08:18.750 --> 01:08:19.979
presentation.

01:08:19.979 --> 01:08:22.330
But that's the main person
who learns in

01:08:22.330 --> 01:08:23.359
that teaching session.

01:08:23.359 --> 01:08:25.870
So there are several graduate
seminars, many I took as a

01:08:25.870 --> 01:08:28.330
graduate student, that are
run the following way.

01:08:28.330 --> 01:08:31.290
The professor just sits
back and each time--

01:08:31.290 --> 01:08:34.410
they assign a list of topics,
and each student volunteers

01:08:34.410 --> 01:08:37.399
for one topic to present
to everybody else.

01:08:37.399 --> 01:08:40.450
Now, that is a fantastic way
to learn one topic in the

01:08:40.450 --> 01:08:41.720
entire course.

01:08:41.720 --> 01:08:43.140
And it does work for that.

01:08:43.140 --> 01:08:45.800
And part of my Ph.D. Came out
of one of the topics that I

01:08:45.800 --> 01:08:48.090
learned from one of those
courses, because I really

01:08:48.090 --> 01:08:50.529
wanted to figure it out.

01:08:50.529 --> 01:08:51.640
So it can work.

01:08:51.640 --> 01:08:52.649
And it does work in some ways.

01:08:52.649 --> 01:08:55.350
But it's not a very efficient
way, because all the other

01:08:55.350 --> 01:08:56.960
people are just basically
passive.

01:08:56.960 --> 01:08:58.439
Yeah, they read the stuff.

01:08:58.439 --> 01:09:00.760
But now they're being taught by
someone who's just barely

01:09:00.760 --> 01:09:04.649
mastering the field and is not
likely to teach interactively

01:09:04.649 --> 01:09:06.560
with a large margin of safety.

01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:09.540
So it's much better to have
students teach each other by

01:09:09.540 --> 01:09:13.200
having them argue with each
other on small time scale.

01:09:13.200 --> 01:09:15.750
So for example, if you remember
in the wood blocks, I

01:09:15.750 --> 01:09:18.950
said, OK, are you with your
neighbor about your answer?

01:09:18.950 --> 01:09:22.020
Well, now the students are
trying to teach each other.

01:09:22.020 --> 01:09:25.560
Some students think, oh yeah,
it's due to the bending.

01:09:25.560 --> 01:09:27.840
OK, well that turns
out to be correct.

01:09:27.840 --> 01:09:29.250
But can you convince
your neighbor?

01:09:29.250 --> 01:09:30.850
Well, in trying to convince
your neighbor,

01:09:30.850 --> 01:09:32.760
you are doing teaching.

01:09:32.760 --> 01:09:34.950
You're trying to figure out,
what's a way that you can do

01:09:34.950 --> 01:09:36.729
it without writing down
50 equations.

01:09:36.729 --> 01:09:38.729
That's exactly what you want
to do in teaching.

01:09:38.729 --> 01:09:41.290
So I think it's a much better
way, is to build the

01:09:41.290 --> 01:09:44.590
interactivity into the class
for everybody, rather than

01:09:44.590 --> 01:09:47.130
having it as a rotating seminar
where just one person

01:09:47.130 --> 01:09:48.380
at a time learns.

01:09:54.630 --> 01:09:56.880
In organizing big ideas
into a tree, there are

01:09:56.880 --> 01:09:58.730
often multiple ways--

01:09:58.730 --> 01:10:00.890
for example, you can do current
understanding versus

01:10:00.890 --> 01:10:03.670
history, or experiment versus
theory-- and it's often good

01:10:03.670 --> 01:10:06.260
for students to know more than
one of these organizations.

01:10:06.260 --> 01:10:08.540
How do you do that in
a course design?

01:10:08.540 --> 01:10:12.780
Yeah, so unfortunately there's
only one time dimension.

01:10:12.780 --> 01:10:14.120
There's three space
dimensions, but

01:10:14.120 --> 01:10:15.180
only one time dimension.

01:10:15.180 --> 01:10:18.560
So the course has to evolve
in one dimension somehow.

01:10:18.560 --> 01:10:20.610
So you need at least
one organization.

01:10:20.610 --> 01:10:21.490
But you're right.

01:10:21.490 --> 01:10:23.680
You need other organizations
as well.

01:10:23.680 --> 01:10:28.030
So the way I square that
circle is as follows.

01:10:35.690 --> 01:10:37.486
So let's say time
goes that way.

01:10:42.530 --> 01:10:43.650
So this is unit one.

01:10:43.650 --> 01:10:45.820
Let's say it's one technique,
one mode of reasoning,

01:10:45.820 --> 01:10:46.840
dimensional analysis.

01:10:46.840 --> 01:10:48.140
Let's say this is another
mode of reasoning,

01:10:48.140 --> 01:10:49.820
conservation, and so on.

01:10:49.820 --> 01:10:51.580
So these are units.

01:10:51.580 --> 01:10:52.610
And now you have topics.

01:10:52.610 --> 01:10:54.640
Well, what I like to do is
I want to show other

01:10:54.640 --> 01:10:55.440
organizations.

01:10:55.440 --> 01:10:56.630
And why is that good?

01:10:56.630 --> 01:10:58.660
Well, what you're doing
is you're connecting.

01:10:58.660 --> 01:11:00.230
You're building threads
across.

01:11:00.230 --> 01:11:00.660
And you're right.

01:11:00.660 --> 01:11:01.970
You definitely want
to do that.

01:11:01.970 --> 01:11:07.300
So what I'll do is I'll find
problems that can be solved

01:11:07.300 --> 01:11:08.550
multiple ways.

01:11:12.190 --> 01:11:15.130
Suppose this is, for example,
a problem about a pendulum.

01:11:15.130 --> 01:11:17.670
Well, you can solve a pendulum
with dimensional analysis.

01:11:17.670 --> 01:11:21.540
You can also solve a pendulum
with conservation laws.

01:11:21.540 --> 01:11:22.740
So I'll do it again.

01:11:22.740 --> 01:11:26.060
So this way, this method is
sufficient to solve it mostly.

01:11:26.060 --> 01:11:27.550
This method is sufficient,
but now we're

01:11:27.550 --> 01:11:29.970
revisiting the old problem.

01:11:29.970 --> 01:11:35.610
So I try to find problems that
thread through, and maybe then

01:11:35.610 --> 01:11:37.180
reappear over here.

01:11:37.180 --> 01:11:41.440
So that gives you a cross
cutting organization.

01:11:41.440 --> 01:11:44.650
So you can do that not just with
problems, but with, for

01:11:44.650 --> 01:11:46.380
example, other principles.

01:11:46.380 --> 01:11:48.160
For example, the history--

01:11:48.160 --> 01:11:51.140
suppose you want to incorporate
history versus

01:11:51.140 --> 01:11:52.560
current understanding.

01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:55.170
Well, every time you mention
history and the importance of

01:11:55.170 --> 01:11:58.110
history, you say, oh look,
there's yet another example

01:11:58.110 --> 01:11:59.050
where we learned from history.

01:11:59.050 --> 01:11:59.990
We learned it here.

01:11:59.990 --> 01:12:01.180
We've learned it in this unit.

01:12:01.180 --> 01:12:05.680
So now the students have yet
another structure to bind the

01:12:05.680 --> 01:12:08.640
course together.

01:12:08.640 --> 01:12:11.470
This is hard to do the first
time you teach the course.

01:12:11.470 --> 01:12:14.100
What you'll do is this first
time you teach your course,

01:12:14.100 --> 01:12:15.460
well, you'll probably do
it the regular way.

01:12:15.460 --> 01:12:17.950
The second time, you'll maybe
reorganize it this way.

01:12:17.950 --> 01:12:21.020
And the third time you do it,
you start building all the

01:12:21.020 --> 01:12:21.970
bridges across it.

01:12:21.970 --> 01:12:24.250
Because that's the only time
you actually see them too.

01:12:31.660 --> 01:12:33.970
What are my thoughts
on grade inflation?

01:12:33.970 --> 01:12:36.980
I wish every grade was an A. So
I think there isn't enough

01:12:36.980 --> 01:12:40.080
of it, because of the studies
I said before.

01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:42.850
So I'll talk about that in
the penultimate lecture.

01:12:51.730 --> 01:12:55.990
I think most of these, yeah, I
think I've now answered with

01:12:55.990 --> 01:12:57.600
other comments or questions
that are there, except for

01:12:57.600 --> 01:12:59.060
one, which I'll save
for next time.

00:00:12.065 --> 00:00:13.190 align:middle line:90%
CASEY RODRIGUEZ: All right.

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:16.100 align:middle line:84%
So last time, we proved
the fundamental theorem

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:16.880 align:middle line:90%
of calculus.

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.340 align:middle line:84%
And as a consequence,
integration by parts of formula

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:23.250 align:middle line:84%
and the change of variables
formula or use substitution.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:29.590 align:middle line:84%
So let me just recall,
for integration by parts,

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:36.200 align:middle line:84%
it was that if I have two
continuously differentiable

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:56.670 align:middle line:84%
functions, then I can shift the
burden of taking a derivative.

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:03.330 align:middle line:84%
F prime times g integrate
is equal to f of b, g of b,

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:13.380 align:middle line:84%
minus f of a, g of a, minus
the interval from a to b of g

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.810 align:middle line:90%
prime f.

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.540 align:middle line:84%
So I can shift that
derivative over from f to g.

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:27.960 align:middle line:84%
And this is apart from
the triangle inequality,

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:34.110 align:middle line:84%
probably one of the most
useful theorems that comes out

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.070 align:middle line:84%
of calculus other than
the fundamental theorem

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:36.570 align:middle line:90%
of calculus.

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.560 align:middle line:90%


00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:45.340 align:middle line:84%
In fact, for those of you who've
taken quantum mechanics, which

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:46.810 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you don't have to.

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.380 align:middle line:84%
But or you heard of something
called the Heisenberg

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.830 align:middle line:84%
uncertainty principle, which
says something like something

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:58.810 align:middle line:84%
to the effect that you
cannot measure the position

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:07.420 align:middle line:84%
of a particle and its momentum
to arbitrarily good degree,

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.900 align:middle line:84%
you're bound by if you
can measure the position

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:13.420 align:middle line:84%
of a particle very well,
then your measurement

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:18.650 align:middle line:84%
of the momentum is going to be
not so great and vice versa.

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.438 align:middle line:84%
And that's based
on an inequality,

00:02:22.438 --> 00:02:23.980 align:middle line:84%
and how do you prove
that inequality?

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.430 align:middle line:90%
Integration by parts.

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.730 align:middle line:84%
So integration by
parts is, in fact,

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.710 align:middle line:84%
responsible for one of
the great head-scratchers

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:33.780 align:middle line:90%
from quantum mechanics.

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.837 align:middle line:84%
So just to back up my
claim a little bit.

00:02:36.837 --> 00:02:38.920 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm not going to give
that as an application.

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.510 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to give a different
application related to Fourier

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:42.010 align:middle line:90%
series.

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:52.740 align:middle line:90%


00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:57.270 align:middle line:84%
So the Fourier series,
what are these?

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:00.192 align:middle line:90%
So suppose we have a function.

00:03:00.192 --> 00:03:01.650 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not going
to say what type.

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:10.305 align:middle line:84%
Suppose f from minus pi to
pi to R is 2 pi periodic.

00:03:10.305 --> 00:03:15.560 align:middle line:90%


00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:22.270 align:middle line:84%
And so, the question
that arose due to Fourier

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:24.990 align:middle line:90%
in his study of heat transfer--

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:29.600 align:middle line:84%
so this is Fourier,
I don't know,

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.040 align:middle line:90%
something like 200 years ago.

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:37.980 align:middle line:90%


00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:45.750 align:middle line:84%
He made the following claim,
that the function f of x

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:59.210 align:middle line:84%
can be expanded in terms
of simpler building blocks,

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:00.630 align:middle line:90%
in terms of simpler functions.

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:03.380 align:middle line:84%
So we haven't talked
about Taylor series.

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:06.620 align:middle line:84%
We will in just a
minute, or power series,

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:08.120 align:middle line:84%
which you've come
into contact with,

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:14.870 align:middle line:84%
which is a way of, if you like,
expanding a function in terms

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:17.160 align:middle line:90%
of polynomials.

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.050 align:middle line:90%
And now-- or monomials.

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:29.730 align:middle line:84%
Now, Fourier
suggested that f of x

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:34.260 align:middle line:84%
can be expanded as a
superposition of functions

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:38.790 align:middle line:84%
which are 2 pi periodic and
kind of the most basic 2

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:40.260 align:middle line:90%
pi periodic functions.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:44.710 align:middle line:84%
Now, what is so special
about sine x and cosine x?

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:47.850 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is a
little bit deeper,

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:50.310 align:middle line:84%
the fact that they satisfy
certain second order

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:51.960 align:middle line:90%
differential equation.

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:56.670 align:middle line:84%
And they are all of the
solutions to the second order

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:59.370 align:middle line:84%
differential equation
that are 2 pi periodic.

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:01.880 align:middle line:90%


00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:04.550 align:middle line:84%
So you should think of these as
kind of being building blocks.

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:13.955 align:middle line:84%
Another way to think
of this is analogous to

00:05:13.955 --> 00:05:19.940 align:middle line:84%
for if you have a vector, so
now this is not a partition.

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:26.050 align:middle line:84%
This is a vector,
x1, x2, xn, then

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:35.160 align:middle line:84%
you can expand this vector
as a sum of coefficients

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:42.347 align:middle line:84%
a sub n, a sub j,
j equals 1 to n.

00:05:42.347 --> 00:05:42.930 align:middle line:90%
You know what?

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:47.880 align:middle line:84%
Let me make this M. Let's make
this N. Let's make this M,

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:50.190 align:middle line:90%
so it looks a little--

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:55.620 align:middle line:84%
a sub n, e sub,
where now, e sub n

00:05:55.620 --> 00:06:07.400 align:middle line:84%
this is the basis
vector given by 0 1 0

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:12.260 align:middle line:90%
where this is in the end spot.

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:17.160 align:middle line:90%


00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:19.560 align:middle line:84%
So you can think
of this expansion

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.840 align:middle line:84%
in terms of sines
and cosines as being

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:29.820 align:middle line:84%
analogous to expanding a vector
in terms of basis elements.

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:32.250 align:middle line:84%
Or you can think of
it as a different way

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:37.980 align:middle line:84%
to expand a function other than
Taylor series or power series.

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:44.790 align:middle line:84%
But these components
arose in a natural way

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:48.420 align:middle line:84%
if one were to study the
problem of heat transfer, which

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:57.510 align:middle line:84%
is governed by the equation
dtu equals dx squared u.

00:06:57.510 --> 00:07:06.530 align:middle line:84%
And then, along with an initial
condition, that u of 0x,

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:09.530 align:middle line:90%
so at time 0, equals f of x.

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:13.176 align:middle line:90%


00:07:13.176 --> 00:07:23.600 align:middle line:84%
So now, just like for how we
expand a vector into basis

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:28.970 align:middle line:84%
elements, there's a formula for
computing these coefficients.

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:33.810 align:middle line:84%
So they should be a sub n
should be x sub n over here.

00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:44.100 align:middle line:84%
But what's a different way of
obtaining these coefficients?

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:46.650 align:middle line:90%


00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:50.200 align:middle line:90%
So this is a vector in RM.

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:57.448 align:middle line:90%


00:07:57.448 --> 00:08:00.790 align:middle line:84%
And so, how do you obtain
the coefficients a sub n?

00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:05.680 align:middle line:84%
Well, if I take the inner
product of both sides,

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:13.450 align:middle line:84%
the dot product, say of e
x dot, let's say, e sub n

00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:15.640 align:middle line:90%
prime, let's say--

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:18.700 align:middle line:90%
so I've used Mn, let's say l.

00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:25.540 align:middle line:84%
This is equal to the sum from n
equals 1 to the M of a sub n, e

00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:29.020 align:middle line:90%
sub n dot e sub l.

00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:32.049 align:middle line:84%
Now, I wrote these basis vectors
this way, because that's kind

00:08:32.049 --> 00:08:34.720 align:middle line:90%
of a standard choice for RM.

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:37.840 align:middle line:84%
And what makes them standard
is, they have unit length.

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:41.570 align:middle line:84%
And they're orthogonal
to each other.

00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:43.220 align:middle line:84%
So they form in
orthonormal basis.

00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:49.240 align:middle line:84%
So when I take the product
of e sub n with e sub l,

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:58.650 align:middle line:84%
I pick up what is usually
referred to as delta in l.

00:08:58.650 --> 00:09:08.340 align:middle line:84%
Where here, delta in l, this
is 1 if n equals l, and 0 if n

00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:09.390 align:middle line:90%
does not equal l.

00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:12.570 align:middle line:90%


00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:15.120 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, this
just reduces to a l.

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:24.755 align:middle line:84%
So we see that a sub l is
equal to x dot e sub l.

00:09:24.755 --> 00:09:27.660 align:middle line:90%


00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:29.820 align:middle line:84%
And so, all of
this discussion was

00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:35.230 align:middle line:84%
in the setting of a finite
dimensional vector in RM.

00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:38.560 align:middle line:84%
And expanding in terms of
the standard basis here.

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:41.030 align:middle line:90%
But it didn't have to be.

00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:44.800 align:middle line:84%
It could have been as long
as it's an orthonormal basis,

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:48.220 align:middle line:84%
then I get this relation,
that the coefficient that

00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:50.860 align:middle line:84%
appears in front
of that vector is

00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:54.400 align:middle line:84%
equal to the thing I'm
interested in dotted

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:59.180 align:middle line:84%
with that vector,
which is written here.

00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:02.770 align:middle line:90%


00:10:02.770 --> 00:10:05.340 align:middle line:84%
So let's say we try and do
the same thing now with f

00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:06.900 align:middle line:90%
of x, except now and say--

00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:08.450 align:middle line:90%
so these are functions.

00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:11.820 align:middle line:84%
So instead of
taking dot products,

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:19.930 align:middle line:84%
which is a sum of components,
let's take an integral.

00:10:19.930 --> 00:10:33.310 align:middle line:84%
So if I take f of
x and, if you like,

00:10:33.310 --> 00:10:36.850 align:middle line:84%
dot it with sine
of x in sum, which

00:10:36.850 --> 00:10:40.750 align:middle line:84%
is-- you can think of as I
said that the integral is,

00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:44.770 align:middle line:84%
you should think of as
maybe a continuous sum.

00:10:44.770 --> 00:10:49.840 align:middle line:84%
What do we get assuming
that this expansion holds,

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:52.450 align:middle line:84%
this is equal to the
sum from n equals 0.

00:10:52.450 --> 00:10:56.970 align:middle line:90%
So let me make this l.

00:10:56.970 --> 00:11:04.790 align:middle line:84%
This is the sum from n equals
0 to infinity of a sub n

00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:08.750 align:middle line:90%
sine n, x times sine.

00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:12.080 align:middle line:84%
So let me-- forgetting to
write the integrals here.

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:15.400 align:middle line:90%


00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:19.270 align:middle line:84%
Skipping a point I
want to make as well.

00:11:19.270 --> 00:11:23.590 align:middle line:84%
Sum, and just remember the sum
is starting from 0 to infinity.

00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:25.030 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to keep writing it.

00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:41.510 align:middle line:84%
a n sine n x sine l x plus bn
cosine in x sine n l x, sine x.

00:11:41.510 --> 00:11:44.709 align:middle line:90%


00:11:44.709 --> 00:11:47.150 align:middle line:84%
And then, n equals
0 to infinity.

00:11:47.150 --> 00:11:48.290 align:middle line:90%
I'll just write it.

00:11:48.290 --> 00:11:49.880 align:middle line:90%
Stop being lazy.

00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:52.250 align:middle line:84%
Now, assuming I can do
what I'm about to do,

00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:58.400 align:middle line:84%
and that's actually going to
be a lot of the motivation

00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:02.630 align:middle line:84%
for what we're going to
discuss in our final chapter,

00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:04.790 align:middle line:84%
assuming I can take
this infinite sum

00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:06.410 align:middle line:84%
and interchange it
with this integral,

00:12:06.410 --> 00:12:09.320 align:middle line:84%
this is the interchanging
of two limits.

00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:11.150 align:middle line:90%
The sum is the infinite limit.

00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:12.770 align:middle line:90%
An integration is a limit.

00:12:12.770 --> 00:12:21.240 align:middle line:84%
So assuming I can switch
these two limiting processes,

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:37.060 align:middle line:84%
then I pick up a sub n minus pi
to pi, sine in x, sine in lx,

00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:44.650 align:middle line:84%
sine lx, sorry, plus b sub n
integral minus pi to pi, cosine

00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:50.446 align:middle line:90%
in x, sine lx dx.

00:12:50.446 --> 00:12:53.070 align:middle line:90%


00:12:53.070 --> 00:12:58.710 align:middle line:84%
Now, you can actually sit
down and compute this based

00:12:58.710 --> 00:13:02.010 align:middle line:90%
on trigonometric identities.

00:13:02.010 --> 00:13:07.680 align:middle line:84%
And what you get is that
this is always equal to 0.

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:14.010 align:middle line:84%
And that this here equals
pi times delta in l.

00:13:14.010 --> 00:13:18.240 align:middle line:90%


00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:22.740 align:middle line:84%
So this equals the
sum from n equals 0

00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:33.300 align:middle line:84%
to infinity a n pi delta in
l, which equals pi times al.

00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:37.760 align:middle line:90%


00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:44.120 align:middle line:84%
So we get this quantity here is
assuming everything we've done

00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:46.940 align:middle line:84%
is kosher equal to
pi times a sub l.

00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:49.490 align:middle line:84%
And then, to pick up
the b sub l is the same,

00:13:49.490 --> 00:13:51.970 align:middle line:84%
except now you integrate
against cosine of lx.

00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:54.590 align:middle line:90%


00:13:54.590 --> 00:14:03.830 align:middle line:84%
So similarly, pi
times b sub l is

00:14:03.830 --> 00:14:06.680 align:middle line:84%
equal to the integral
from minus pi

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:15.674 align:middle line:90%
to pi of f of x cosine lx dx.

00:14:15.674 --> 00:14:27.140 align:middle line:90%


00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:29.810 align:middle line:84%
So the b sub l's and a sub l's
are referred to as a Fourier

00:14:29.810 --> 00:14:33.845 align:middle line:90%
coefficients of the function f.

00:14:33.845 --> 00:14:37.900 align:middle line:90%


00:14:37.900 --> 00:15:01.430 align:middle line:84%
So if f from minus pi to
pi to R is continuous,

00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:20.450 align:middle line:84%
and 2 pi periodic, the
numbers a sub n equals 1

00:15:20.450 --> 00:15:29.655 align:middle line:84%
over pi, integral from minus
pi to pi of f of x sine nx, dx,

00:15:29.655 --> 00:15:37.950 align:middle line:84%
b sub n equals 1 over pi,
integral from minus pi to pi,

00:15:37.950 --> 00:15:43.490 align:middle line:84%
f of x cosine in x, dx are
referred to as the Fourier

00:15:43.490 --> 00:15:44.600 align:middle line:90%
coefficients of f.

00:15:44.600 --> 00:16:07.115 align:middle line:90%


00:16:07.115 --> 00:16:12.250 align:middle line:84%
And so, just using
integration by parts,

00:16:12.250 --> 00:16:14.460 align:middle line:84%
so what's the first
question one should

00:16:14.460 --> 00:16:19.230 align:middle line:84%
ask if it's even possible,
or in what sense does

00:16:19.230 --> 00:16:21.815 align:middle line:90%
f of x equal this infinite sum?

00:16:21.815 --> 00:16:23.440 align:middle line:84%
Well, we haven't even
gotten into that.

00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:27.240 align:middle line:84%
But one question you can ask
is, do these coefficients that

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:29.280 align:middle line:84%
come in front of these
basic building blocks,

00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:32.640 align:middle line:84%
sine nx and cosine nx,
do they converge to 0?

00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:35.310 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if we
expect f of x to be

00:16:35.310 --> 00:16:38.280 align:middle line:84%
equal to the sum of
these basic parts,

00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:40.920 align:middle line:84%
then the contributions
from each should

00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:43.500 align:middle line:90%
be getting smaller and smaller.

00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:48.520 align:middle line:84%
So does a n and bn tend to
0 as n goes to infinity?

00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:50.400 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
content of what's

00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:52.800 align:middle line:84%
usually referred to as the
Riemann-Lebesque lemma.

00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:56.370 align:middle line:90%


00:16:56.370 --> 00:16:58.990 align:middle line:84%
But it's usually stated
in a different way.

00:16:58.990 --> 00:17:02.460 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to state
it this way right now.

00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:12.859 align:middle line:90%


00:17:12.859 --> 00:17:17.220 align:middle line:90%
And which is the following.

00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:34.850 align:middle line:84%
If f from ab to R is
continuously differentiable,

00:17:34.850 --> 00:17:44.530 align:middle line:84%
then limit as n goes
to infinity of a sub n

00:17:44.530 --> 00:17:50.410 align:middle line:84%
equals the limit as n goes to
infinity of b sub n equals 0.

00:17:50.410 --> 00:17:52.900 align:middle line:84%
Now, the actual way the
Riemann-Lebesque lemma

00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:55.250 align:middle line:84%
is typically stated
is, in fact, I

00:17:55.250 --> 00:17:57.250 align:middle line:84%
don't need it to be
continuously differentiable.

00:17:57.250 --> 00:17:58.640 align:middle line:90%
I just need it to be continuous.

00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:01.430 align:middle line:90%
This is still true.

00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:03.500 align:middle line:90%
But we haven't done--

00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:08.740 align:middle line:84%
or won't do in this
class approximation

00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:11.260 align:middle line:84%
theorems for
continuous functions.

00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:12.820 align:middle line:84%
Which says that
if you can do this

00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:14.650 align:middle line:84%
for continuously
differentiable functions,

00:18:14.650 --> 00:18:18.200 align:middle line:84%
then basically you can do
it for continuous functions.

00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:20.440 align:middle line:90%
But this will suffice.

00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:24.250 align:middle line:84%
So what this says is that
the contributions coming

00:18:24.250 --> 00:18:26.470 align:middle line:84%
from these building
blocks is getting smaller,

00:18:26.470 --> 00:18:28.510 align:middle line:84%
at least in the sense
that the coefficients are

00:18:28.510 --> 00:18:29.410 align:middle line:90%
getting smaller.

00:18:29.410 --> 00:18:34.240 align:middle line:84%
But it says nothing about
if that sum up there

00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:36.760 align:middle line:84%
with the a n's and bn's
defined this way actually

00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:38.170 align:middle line:90%
converges to f.

00:18:38.170 --> 00:18:42.430 align:middle line:84%
I do want to emphasize that, in
fact, trying to straighten out

00:18:42.430 --> 00:18:46.450 align:middle line:84%
this question, in what
sense this series converges

00:18:46.450 --> 00:18:51.340 align:middle line:84%
to f is really the motivation
for a lot of analysis

00:18:51.340 --> 00:19:00.560 align:middle line:84%
developed past in the first
part of the last century

00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:03.200 align:middle line:84%
and the last part of
the century before that

00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:07.280 align:middle line:84%
and forms the basis of what's
called harmonic analysis.

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:11.870 align:middle line:90%


00:19:11.870 --> 00:19:13.540 align:middle line:84%
Which is a really
beautiful subject

00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:16.540 align:middle line:84%
and still an active area
of ongoing research.

00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:24.030 align:middle line:90%


00:19:24.030 --> 00:19:25.720 align:middle line:90%
So how do we prove this?

00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:29.170 align:middle line:84%
Well, I stated the integration
by parts formula earlier.

00:19:29.170 --> 00:19:35.730 align:middle line:84%
So in fact, it'll follow
pretty easily from that.

00:19:35.730 --> 00:19:41.340 align:middle line:84%
Let's prove that the limit
as n goes to infinity

00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:42.360 align:middle line:90%
of b sub n equals 0.

00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:44.013 align:middle line:90%
The one for a sub n is similar.

00:19:44.013 --> 00:19:45.180 align:middle line:90%
There's just an extra piece.

00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:48.540 align:middle line:84%
But I'm going to be a little
bit lazy and do the easier one.

00:19:48.540 --> 00:20:06.320 align:middle line:84%
We'll show-- so let's
look at b sub n.

00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:15.140 align:middle line:84%
This is equal to the integral
from minus pi to pi of f of x.

00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:23.295 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, let me write
cosine nx times f of x, dx, dx.

00:20:23.295 --> 00:20:24.295 align:middle line:90%
Why am I writing dx, dx?

00:20:24.295 --> 00:20:27.940 align:middle line:90%


00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:32.590 align:middle line:84%
And now what I do
is, cosine nx, I

00:20:32.590 --> 00:20:35.470 align:middle line:84%
can write as the
derivative of something.

00:20:35.470 --> 00:20:39.225 align:middle line:90%
1 over n times sine nx.

00:20:39.225 --> 00:20:41.350 align:middle line:84%
If I take the derivative
of that with respect to x,

00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:42.505 align:middle line:90%
I get cosine nx.

00:20:42.505 --> 00:20:46.230 align:middle line:90%


00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:47.670 align:middle line:90%
I didn't actually prove that.

00:20:47.670 --> 00:20:52.890 align:middle line:84%
But you can look back in
your calculus textbooks.

00:20:52.890 --> 00:20:57.620 align:middle line:84%
We've proven enough to be
able to make that precise.

00:20:57.620 --> 00:21:02.990 align:middle line:84%
So by integration by parts,
I can now shift the blame,

00:21:02.990 --> 00:21:05.927 align:middle line:84%
or shift the burden of
this derivative onto f.

00:21:05.927 --> 00:21:07.010 align:middle line:90%
But look what I've gained.

00:21:07.010 --> 00:21:08.940 align:middle line:90%
I've gained 1 over n here.

00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:14.840 align:middle line:84%
So now, this is equal
to 1 over n sine n pie,

00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:26.420 align:middle line:84%
f of pi minus sine of n
minus pi times f of pi--

00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:38.190 align:middle line:84%
minus pi, sorry-- minus 1 over
n sine nx minus pi to pi, f

00:21:38.190 --> 00:21:39.470 align:middle line:90%
prime of x, dx.

00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:43.290 align:middle line:90%


00:21:43.290 --> 00:21:47.580 align:middle line:84%
And really, what this
competition is showing is--

00:21:47.580 --> 00:21:51.270 align:middle line:84%
illustrating is the oscillatory
nature of what's going on.

00:21:51.270 --> 00:21:55.440 align:middle line:84%
Cosine of nx is oscillating as n
gets very large between minus 1

00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:59.320 align:middle line:90%
and 1 and equal footing.

00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:02.190 align:middle line:84%
So on average, you're
getting the same amount

00:22:02.190 --> 00:22:03.900 align:middle line:90%
of positive f as minus--

00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:04.920 align:middle line:90%
as negative f.

00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:09.960 align:middle line:84%
So or you're weighting
f in such a way

00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:14.055 align:middle line:84%
that it's both positive and
negative in equal amounts.

00:22:14.055 --> 00:22:16.560 align:middle line:90%


00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:19.710 align:middle line:84%
Now, sine of n pi, no
matter what n is, I get 0.

00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:21.970 align:middle line:90%
Sine of n of minus pi, I get 0.

00:22:21.970 --> 00:22:23.460 align:middle line:90%
So this first part drops off.

00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:29.250 align:middle line:84%
So this is equal to minus 1
over n, minus pi, pi, sine

00:22:29.250 --> 00:22:33.510 align:middle line:90%
in x, times f prime of x, dx.

00:22:33.510 --> 00:22:38.220 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, if I take the
absolute value of b sub n,

00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:46.320 align:middle line:84%
this is less than or equal
to 1 over n minus pi over pi,

00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:51.180 align:middle line:90%
sine in x f prime of x, dx.

00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:56.430 align:middle line:84%
If I bring the
absolute value inside,

00:22:56.430 --> 00:23:03.520 align:middle line:84%
so I can bring the absolute
value inside and still get

00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:04.020 align:middle line:90%
this.

00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:06.270 align:middle line:84%
So in fact, before when I had
the absolute value outside,

00:23:06.270 --> 00:23:07.080 align:middle line:90%
it's the equality.

00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:08.730 align:middle line:84%
But now it's a less
than or equality--

00:23:08.730 --> 00:23:11.600 align:middle line:90%


00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:12.840 align:middle line:90%
I mean, an inequality.

00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:18.950 align:middle line:84%
So now, sign of nx is
always bounded by 1.

00:23:18.950 --> 00:23:23.680 align:middle line:84%
So this is less than or
equal to the integral of f

00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:24.790 align:middle line:90%
prime of x, dx.

00:23:24.790 --> 00:23:30.250 align:middle line:84%
So this is equal to 1
over n integral a, b, f.

00:23:30.250 --> 00:23:32.530 align:middle line:90%
Now, this is just f prime.

00:23:32.530 --> 00:23:35.260 align:middle line:84%
This is just a fixed
number times 1 over n.

00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:40.140 align:middle line:84%
So this converges to 0
as n goes to infinity.

00:23:40.140 --> 00:23:42.247 align:middle line:84%
And b sub n, an absolute
value, of course,

00:23:42.247 --> 00:23:43.830 align:middle line:84%
it's always bigger
than or equal to 0.

00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:45.570 align:middle line:84%
And it's bounded by
something converging

00:23:45.570 --> 00:23:47.560 align:middle line:90%
to 0 as n goes to infinity.

00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:56.560 align:middle line:84%
So by the squeeze
theorem, we conclude

00:23:56.560 --> 00:23:59.915 align:middle line:90%
b sub n converges to 0.

00:23:59.915 --> 00:24:00.790 align:middle line:90%
And that's the proof.

00:24:00.790 --> 00:24:05.080 align:middle line:84%
The proof for the a
sub n's is similar,

00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:11.790 align:middle line:84%
except now you can't throw
away necessarily the endpoints.

00:24:11.790 --> 00:24:13.635 align:middle line:84%
But it's still not
a very big deal.

00:24:13.635 --> 00:24:26.300 align:middle line:90%


00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:29.460 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, if we have time,
I'll show you how much--

00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:38.650 align:middle line:84%
so in fact, one can prove-- and
this is proven in classes on--

00:24:38.650 --> 00:24:41.290 align:middle line:84%
courses on harmonic
analysis, that in fact,

00:24:41.290 --> 00:24:45.430 align:middle line:84%
for a function which is
continuously differentiable,

00:24:45.430 --> 00:24:48.310 align:middle line:84%
this-- and 2 pi
periodic-- this series

00:24:48.310 --> 00:24:54.388 align:middle line:84%
actually does converge
uniformly to f on this interval.

00:24:54.388 --> 00:24:56.680 align:middle line:84%
And I haven't even said what
uniform convergence means.

00:24:56.680 --> 00:25:00.720 align:middle line:84%
But actually does converge
to the function f of x.

00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:07.760 align:middle line:84%
So this is the case for
continuously differentiable

00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:08.260 align:middle line:90%
functions.

00:25:08.260 --> 00:25:12.970 align:middle line:84%
I'll give a proof later
that, in fact, this series

00:25:12.970 --> 00:25:17.140 align:middle line:84%
converges if f is twice
continuously differentiable.

00:25:17.140 --> 00:25:21.690 align:middle line:84%
We can actually do that
using the fundamental--

00:25:21.690 --> 00:25:27.050 align:middle line:84%
the integration by parts
again, essentially.

00:25:27.050 --> 00:25:31.130 align:middle line:84%
But so, but there
are a few things here

00:25:31.130 --> 00:25:35.540 align:middle line:84%
that are behind the scene
that are kind of swept away.

00:25:35.540 --> 00:25:40.880 align:middle line:84%
First off, when we computed
these formulas-- formulae,

00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:42.980 align:middle line:90%
I guess--

00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:46.280 align:middle line:84%
we interchanged summation,
infinite summation of functions

00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:47.780 align:middle line:90%
with integration.

00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:49.910 align:middle line:90%
When can we do that?

00:25:49.910 --> 00:25:56.780 align:middle line:84%
In what sense does if this
Fourier series converges,

00:25:56.780 --> 00:26:00.620 align:middle line:84%
in what sense does
it converge to f?

00:26:00.620 --> 00:26:04.280 align:middle line:84%
For convergence of
real numbers, there

00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:07.080 align:middle line:84%
was just one sense of the
convergence of real numbers.

00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:10.010 align:middle line:84%
Now, when we have a sequence
of functions, which is now

00:26:10.010 --> 00:26:15.640 align:middle line:84%
what we're going
to turn to, we'll

00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:17.410 align:middle line:84%
have different
notions of convergence

00:26:17.410 --> 00:26:20.110 align:middle line:90%
to another function.

00:26:20.110 --> 00:26:25.990 align:middle line:84%
And depending on in what
sense that conversion--

00:26:25.990 --> 00:26:30.250 align:middle line:84%
that convergence
takes place, some

00:26:30.250 --> 00:26:35.710 align:middle line:84%
of these limiting operations
may not interchange.

00:26:35.710 --> 00:26:39.190 align:middle line:84%
So now, we're going to move
on to the final chapter

00:26:39.190 --> 00:26:41.620 align:middle line:90%
of this class.

00:26:41.620 --> 00:26:43.510 align:middle line:84%
And I know it seems
like we're kind

00:26:43.510 --> 00:26:45.010 align:middle line:84%
of hitting a lot
of different things

00:26:45.010 --> 00:26:46.385 align:middle line:84%
now towards the
end of the class.

00:26:46.385 --> 00:26:48.790 align:middle line:84%
And we took it slow during
the first part of class.

00:26:48.790 --> 00:26:50.710 align:middle line:84%
But that's, like
I said, that's--

00:26:50.710 --> 00:26:52.960 align:middle line:84%
I think I even said this
at the start of class.

00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:55.732 align:middle line:84%
We didn't have very
much to go off of.

00:26:55.732 --> 00:26:57.190 align:middle line:84%
We built things
from the ground up.

00:26:57.190 --> 00:26:59.810 align:middle line:84%
And the more
technology you have,

00:26:59.810 --> 00:27:02.950 align:middle line:84%
the more things you can prove,
the more interesting questions

00:27:02.950 --> 00:27:04.000 align:middle line:90%
you can ask.

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:08.110 align:middle line:84%
So now, we're going to go on
to sequences of functions.

00:27:08.110 --> 00:27:13.580 align:middle line:90%


00:27:13.580 --> 00:27:15.830 align:middle line:84%
And you could also put
sequences and series.

00:27:15.830 --> 00:27:17.840 align:middle line:84%
Because a series is
just a special type

00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:20.150 align:middle line:90%
of sequence of functions.

00:27:20.150 --> 00:27:23.070 align:middle line:90%


00:27:23.070 --> 00:27:29.760 align:middle line:84%
So I motivated a
little bit of why

00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:34.990 align:middle line:84%
we would be interested
in functions converging

00:27:34.990 --> 00:27:37.390 align:middle line:84%
to other functions or sequences
of functions converging

00:27:37.390 --> 00:27:39.730 align:middle line:90%
to a function.

00:27:39.730 --> 00:27:42.400 align:middle line:84%
But we could look at
something much more basic.

00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:48.550 align:middle line:84%
So let's take a step back
and look at power series.

00:27:48.550 --> 00:27:50.590 align:middle line:84%
And this should be
thought of as motivation

00:27:50.590 --> 00:27:56.450 align:middle line:84%
for what's to come, just like
our discussion about Fourier

00:27:56.450 --> 00:27:56.950 align:middle line:90%
series.

00:27:56.950 --> 00:27:59.710 align:middle line:90%


00:27:59.710 --> 00:28:03.970 align:middle line:84%
And again, I'm not going to
ask any questions about Fourier

00:28:03.970 --> 00:28:05.810 align:middle line:84%
series on the homework
or on the exam.

00:28:05.810 --> 00:28:08.590 align:middle line:90%
So a lot of this is just--

00:28:08.590 --> 00:28:15.490 align:middle line:84%
this discussion was to
motivate this theorem here.

00:28:15.490 --> 00:28:20.830 align:middle line:84%
But now, I'm going to
make a kind of a more

00:28:20.830 --> 00:28:24.470 align:middle line:84%
precise motivation, I
guess, for what's to come.

00:28:24.470 --> 00:28:29.020 align:middle line:84%
So although we've
had series forever,

00:28:29.020 --> 00:28:30.400 align:middle line:90%
I never brought up power series.

00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:31.340 align:middle line:90%
And it's for a reason.

00:28:31.340 --> 00:28:34.060 align:middle line:84%
It's because I didn't think
they belonged anywhere until we

00:28:34.060 --> 00:28:35.540 align:middle line:90%
got to sequences of functions.

00:28:35.540 --> 00:28:49.140 align:middle line:84%
So a power series
about a point x0

00:28:49.140 --> 00:29:03.080 align:middle line:84%
is a series of the form sum from
j equals 0 to infinity of a sub

00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:07.350 align:middle line:90%
j, x minus x0 to the j.

00:29:07.350 --> 00:29:09.375 align:middle line:90%
So the x0 is given.

00:29:09.375 --> 00:29:12.240 align:middle line:90%


00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:16.200 align:middle line:84%
And the things that could
change are the coefficients

00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:17.880 align:middle line:90%
or this number x here.

00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:23.400 align:middle line:90%


00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:28.170 align:middle line:84%
So theorem, which
immediately follows

00:29:28.170 --> 00:29:31.000 align:middle line:90%
from essentially the root test.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:38.320 align:middle line:84%
Suppose, this number R,
which is the limit as j

00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:46.030 align:middle line:84%
goes to infinity of a
sub j, 1 over j exists.

00:29:46.030 --> 00:29:50.200 align:middle line:84%
So it's a finite number,
positive, not negative number.

00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:53.860 align:middle line:90%


00:29:53.860 --> 00:30:05.730 align:middle line:84%
And define rho to be 1 over
R if R is bigger than 0,

00:30:05.730 --> 00:30:09.180 align:middle line:90%
and infinity if R equals 0.

00:30:09.180 --> 00:30:15.780 align:middle line:90%


00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:18.930 align:middle line:84%
Then we have the
following conclusion,

00:30:18.930 --> 00:30:36.331 align:middle line:84%
that this power series a
sub j converges absolutely

00:30:36.331 --> 00:30:48.890 align:middle line:84%
if x minus x0 is less
than rho, and diverges

00:30:48.890 --> 00:30:52.780 align:middle line:84%
if x minus x0 in absolute
value is bigger than rho.

00:30:52.780 --> 00:30:55.460 align:middle line:90%


00:30:55.460 --> 00:31:04.610 align:middle line:84%
And this number rho, we refer
to as radius of convergence.

00:31:04.610 --> 00:31:14.440 align:middle line:90%


00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:19.360 align:middle line:84%
So again, the proof
follows immediately

00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:31.380 align:middle line:84%
from the root test because
if we take a limit as j

00:31:31.380 --> 00:31:34.920 align:middle line:84%
goes to infinity of a
sub j, absolute value

00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:45.900 align:middle line:84%
x minus x0 j, 1 over j,
this is equal to x minus x0.

00:31:45.900 --> 00:31:46.980 align:middle line:90%
This kills that j.

00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:48.250 align:middle line:90%
This is just a fixed number.

00:31:48.250 --> 00:31:54.110 align:middle line:90%
So this pops out of the limit.

00:31:54.110 --> 00:31:55.200 align:middle line:90%
And this limit exists.

00:31:55.200 --> 00:32:02.690 align:middle line:84%
So this equals x
minus x0 times R.

00:32:02.690 --> 00:32:06.170 align:middle line:84%
And we have two
things happening.

00:32:06.170 --> 00:32:13.370 align:middle line:84%
This is less than 1 if x
minus x0 is less than rho,

00:32:13.370 --> 00:32:18.110 align:middle line:84%
bigger than 1 if x minus
x0 is bigger than rho--

00:32:18.110 --> 00:32:20.860 align:middle line:90%


00:32:20.860 --> 00:32:23.110 align:middle line:90%
this number here.

00:32:23.110 --> 00:32:37.420 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, by the root
test, the theorem holds.

00:32:37.420 --> 00:32:48.150 align:middle line:90%


00:32:48.150 --> 00:32:53.610 align:middle line:84%
So we see that this series,
where the, if you like,

00:32:53.610 --> 00:32:57.100 align:middle line:84%
what's given are the
coefficients a sub j and x0,

00:32:57.100 --> 00:33:01.920 align:middle line:84%
and what could change is x, that
this series converges as long

00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:03.962 align:middle line:90%
as x minus x0 is less than rho.

00:33:03.962 --> 00:33:04.920 align:middle line:90%
So as long as we stay--

00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:21.200 align:middle line:90%


00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:23.900 align:middle line:90%
[SNEEZES] excuse me.

00:33:23.900 --> 00:33:26.510 align:middle line:84%
As long as we stay in that
interval, a symmetric interval

00:33:26.510 --> 00:33:32.180 align:middle line:84%
about x0, then this series
converges, absolutely.

00:33:32.180 --> 00:33:34.430 align:middle line:84%
So we can define
a function where

00:33:34.430 --> 00:33:38.810 align:middle line:84%
if I take x in this interval,
stick it into this series,

00:33:38.810 --> 00:33:39.980 align:middle line:90%
I get out a number.

00:33:39.980 --> 00:33:52.670 align:middle line:84%
So define function f now
going from this interval.

00:33:52.670 --> 00:34:02.810 align:middle line:84%
So x0 minus rho, x0
plus rho to R by f of x

00:34:02.810 --> 00:34:13.770 align:middle line:84%
equals the number that gets
spat out by this power series.

00:34:13.770 --> 00:34:14.850 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE] j there.

00:34:14.850 --> 00:34:22.020 align:middle line:90%


00:34:22.020 --> 00:34:27.260 align:middle line:90%
So for example, what is f of x?

00:34:27.260 --> 00:34:32.114 align:middle line:90%


00:34:32.114 --> 00:34:36.250 align:middle line:84%
Let's say I take all of
the coefficients to be--

00:34:36.250 --> 00:34:39.040 align:middle line:84%
let's say, x0 is 0, and
all the coefficients are 1.

00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:43.960 align:middle line:84%
So let's say I look
at sum of x sub j.

00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:46.750 align:middle line:84%
Then f of x, so we've
already computed

00:34:46.750 --> 00:34:48.650 align:middle line:90%
for a geometric series.

00:34:48.650 --> 00:34:54.370 align:middle line:84%
This is equal to 1 over 1
minus x for x in minus 1, 1.

00:34:54.370 --> 00:34:57.150 align:middle line:90%


00:34:57.150 --> 00:35:01.910 align:middle line:84%
So in the simple setting, 1 over
1 minus x is equal x to the j.

00:35:01.910 --> 00:35:05.930 align:middle line:90%


00:35:05.930 --> 00:35:11.100 align:middle line:84%
Another example
is, that if I take

00:35:11.100 --> 00:35:16.950 align:middle line:84%
a sub j equals 1 over j
factorial, x0 equals 0,

00:35:16.950 --> 00:35:23.190 align:middle line:84%
then you've done
this in an exercise,

00:35:23.190 --> 00:35:34.390 align:middle line:84%
that this series here
converges absolutely for all x.

00:35:34.390 --> 00:35:37.300 align:middle line:90%
And meaning rho equals infinity.

00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:51.030 align:middle line:90%


00:35:51.030 --> 00:35:54.785 align:middle line:84%
And this is how we define
the exponential function.

00:35:54.785 --> 00:36:00.060 align:middle line:90%


00:36:00.060 --> 00:36:01.950 align:middle line:84%
Exponential
function, exponential

00:36:01.950 --> 00:36:06.465 align:middle line:84%
of x to be what comes
out of this series.

00:36:06.465 --> 00:36:17.350 align:middle line:90%


00:36:17.350 --> 00:36:19.280 align:middle line:84%
And then, simply
from this definition,

00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:22.600 align:middle line:84%
you can show things that an
exponential function should

00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:30.610 align:middle line:84%
satisfy, x e to the n is
equal to n e to the e of 1

00:36:30.610 --> 00:36:32.410 align:middle line:84%
to the n-th power,
and so on, and so on.

00:36:32.410 --> 00:36:36.340 align:middle line:84%
So that this really does
obey what you believe

00:36:36.340 --> 00:36:38.450 align:middle line:84%
an exponential function
should look like.

00:36:38.450 --> 00:36:41.830 align:middle line:84%
And also, it grows
faster than any power

00:36:41.830 --> 00:36:45.963 align:middle line:84%
of x as x goes to infinity, goes
to 0, those types of things.

00:36:45.963 --> 00:36:48.130 align:middle line:84%
But this is how the exponential
function is defined.

00:36:48.130 --> 00:36:50.830 align:middle line:90%


00:36:50.830 --> 00:36:58.150 align:middle line:84%
So we have this function that's
defined by whatever this power

00:36:58.150 --> 00:37:06.660 align:middle line:84%
series spits out, for x inside
this interval of convergence.

00:37:06.660 --> 00:37:14.600 align:middle line:84%
So then, I could write
f of x as the limit

00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:19.250 align:middle line:84%
as n goes to infinity of
a sequence of functions.

00:37:19.250 --> 00:37:25.890 align:middle line:84%
Because this is just how
it's defined, where fn of x

00:37:25.890 --> 00:37:28.110 align:middle line:90%
is the partial sum.

00:37:28.110 --> 00:37:34.490 align:middle line:90%


00:37:34.490 --> 00:37:36.560 align:middle line:90%
It's just a polynomial.

00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:41.240 align:middle line:84%
So for power series,
the limiting function,

00:37:41.240 --> 00:37:44.960 align:middle line:84%
you can write it as the limit
of the partial sums, which

00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:46.160 align:middle line:90%
are just polynomials.

00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:48.860 align:middle line:90%


00:37:48.860 --> 00:38:01.785 align:middle line:84%
And so, I should say, for all x
in this interval, we have this.

00:38:01.785 --> 00:38:04.300 align:middle line:90%


00:38:04.300 --> 00:38:10.080 align:middle line:90%
So now, some questions arise.

00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:13.970 align:middle line:84%
So what this function is
equal to, the limit of these

00:38:13.970 --> 00:38:15.230 align:middle line:90%
maybe simpler functions.

00:38:15.230 --> 00:38:17.330 align:middle line:84%
These simpler functions
are just polynomials

00:38:17.330 --> 00:38:19.170 align:middle line:90%
for the case of power series.

00:38:19.170 --> 00:38:21.470 align:middle line:84%
So like I said, 1
over 1 minus x is

00:38:21.470 --> 00:38:23.600 align:middle line:84%
equal to the limit
of these polynomials.

00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:25.580 align:middle line:90%
Some questions should arise.

00:38:25.580 --> 00:38:29.990 align:middle line:84%
I mean, analysis
is about limits.

00:38:29.990 --> 00:38:31.700 align:middle line:84%
You can think of that
as half the story.

00:38:31.700 --> 00:38:35.160 align:middle line:90%
First off, what is the limit?

00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:40.430 align:middle line:84%
What are important limiting
processes that we consider?

00:38:40.430 --> 00:38:48.420 align:middle line:84%
The second question is, how
do different limits interact?

00:38:48.420 --> 00:38:54.290 align:middle line:84%
So let's pose that
as a question now

00:38:54.290 --> 00:38:58.610 align:middle line:84%
for a three-parted
question for power series.

00:38:58.610 --> 00:39:00.080 align:middle line:90%
And this will motivate--

00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:03.470 align:middle line:84%
and this is, again,
motivating all of what

00:39:03.470 --> 00:39:06.230 align:middle line:90%
we're going to be doing now.

00:39:06.230 --> 00:39:20.450 align:middle line:84%
So is the function that I get
as this limit of polynomials

00:39:20.450 --> 00:39:25.700 align:middle line:84%
as the output from a power
series, is it continuous?

00:39:25.700 --> 00:39:27.740 align:middle line:84%
The individual
pieces that I take

00:39:27.740 --> 00:39:31.910 align:middle line:84%
a limit to get f of x, these
polynomials or the partial sums

00:39:31.910 --> 00:39:32.960 align:middle line:90%
are certainly continuous.

00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:34.410 align:middle line:90%
They're just polynomials.

00:39:34.410 --> 00:39:37.160 align:middle line:84%
So is the limiting
thing continuous?

00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:40.300 align:middle line:90%


00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:51.260 align:middle line:90%
Now, if so, is f differentiable?

00:39:51.260 --> 00:39:53.990 align:middle line:84%
And in particular, since
f is equal to the limit

00:39:53.990 --> 00:39:59.360 align:middle line:84%
as n goes to infinity of
the fn's, is f prime equal

00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:03.470 align:middle line:84%
to the limit as n goes to
infinity of the fn prime?

00:40:03.470 --> 00:40:07.850 align:middle line:90%


00:40:07.850 --> 00:40:10.800 align:middle line:84%
So the derivative is
a limiting process.

00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:13.740 align:middle line:84%
So I'm taking the
derivative of the limit.

00:40:13.740 --> 00:40:16.490 align:middle line:84%
So I'm asking, can I take that
derivative inside the limit?

00:40:16.490 --> 00:40:20.060 align:middle line:90%
Can I swap the two processes?

00:40:20.060 --> 00:40:23.540 align:middle line:90%
And the same with integration.

00:40:23.540 --> 00:40:36.300 align:middle line:84%
If one, does the integral
of f equal limit as n goes

00:40:36.300 --> 00:40:40.700 align:middle line:84%
to infinity of the
integrals of the fn's?

00:40:40.700 --> 00:40:51.000 align:middle line:90%


00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:52.650 align:middle line:84%
So again, this is
a limiting process

00:40:52.650 --> 00:40:56.580 align:middle line:84%
that we're asking us to flip,
because f is equal to the limit

00:40:56.580 --> 00:40:58.140 align:middle line:90%
as n goes to infinity of fn.

00:40:58.140 --> 00:41:00.450 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm asking is,
can I take this integral

00:41:00.450 --> 00:41:01.590 align:middle line:90%
inside that limit?

00:41:01.590 --> 00:41:09.240 align:middle line:90%


00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:11.970 align:middle line:84%
Now, you can ask these questions
not just for power series,

00:41:11.970 --> 00:41:13.920 align:middle line:84%
but in a more general
setting, which is what

00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:16.140 align:middle line:90%
we're going to turn to now.

00:41:16.140 --> 00:41:19.010 align:middle line:84%
But this should be in
the back of your mind

00:41:19.010 --> 00:41:20.925 align:middle line:84%
as the motivation
for what we're doing.

00:41:20.925 --> 00:41:23.970 align:middle line:90%


00:41:23.970 --> 00:41:35.770 align:middle line:84%
And apart from being just
an academic question,

00:41:35.770 --> 00:41:38.860 align:middle line:84%
it's also somehow
giving you information

00:41:38.860 --> 00:41:41.170 align:middle line:84%
over whether the formal
manipulations that you're

00:41:41.170 --> 00:41:46.780 align:middle line:84%
doing with Fourier series that
are actually somehow modeling

00:41:46.780 --> 00:41:50.110 align:middle line:84%
some physical phenomenon, are
these formal manipulations even

00:41:50.110 --> 00:41:52.360 align:middle line:90%
meaningful?

00:41:52.360 --> 00:41:56.220 align:middle line:84%
So these are the
three questions that

00:41:56.220 --> 00:41:59.310 align:middle line:84%
motivate what we're going
to do going forward.

00:41:59.310 --> 00:42:02.220 align:middle line:84%
But we don't have to
just stick to the setting

00:42:02.220 --> 00:42:05.460 align:middle line:90%
of being in power series.

00:42:05.460 --> 00:42:10.410 align:middle line:84%
This should be a very
important example

00:42:10.410 --> 00:42:13.590 align:middle line:84%
of a sequence of
functions converging

00:42:13.590 --> 00:42:17.878 align:middle line:84%
to a function, a
limiting function.

00:42:17.878 --> 00:42:19.420 align:middle line:84%
And then, we can
ask these questions.

00:42:19.420 --> 00:42:21.420 align:middle line:84%
But we don't have to just
stick to power series.

00:42:21.420 --> 00:42:27.090 align:middle line:84%
So let me move on to a more
general setting in which we'll

00:42:27.090 --> 00:42:28.590 align:middle line:90%
answer these three questions.

00:42:28.590 --> 00:42:33.180 align:middle line:90%


00:42:33.180 --> 00:42:44.200 align:middle line:84%
And two modes of convergence
for limits of functions

00:42:44.200 --> 00:42:47.630 align:middle line:90%
or sequences of functions.

00:42:47.630 --> 00:42:56.230 align:middle line:84%
So first definition, this
is, in fact, what we showed

00:42:56.230 --> 00:43:05.350 align:middle line:84%
or what we were talking about
before for N natural number,

00:43:05.350 --> 00:43:08.895 align:middle line:84%
let fn be a function
from S to R. S

00:43:08.895 --> 00:43:11.185 align:middle line:84%
is some non-empty subset
of the real numbers.

00:43:11.185 --> 00:43:14.070 align:middle line:90%


00:43:14.070 --> 00:43:21.180 align:middle line:90%
And let f be from S to R.

00:43:21.180 --> 00:43:34.460 align:middle line:84%
We say, fn-- so the sequence
of functions fn converges

00:43:34.460 --> 00:43:48.030 align:middle line:84%
point-wise to the function
f if for all x in S,

00:43:48.030 --> 00:43:54.430 align:middle line:84%
by sticking x into S, so
for each fixed x in S,

00:43:54.430 --> 00:43:57.730 align:middle line:84%
if I stick this into
fn of x, I get a limit.

00:43:57.730 --> 00:44:01.160 align:middle line:90%
And this limit is f of x.

00:44:01.160 --> 00:44:06.070 align:middle line:84%
So for example, going
back to power series,

00:44:06.070 --> 00:44:07.360 align:middle line:90%
if we defined f of x--

00:44:07.360 --> 00:44:10.360 align:middle line:90%


00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:15.855 align:middle line:84%
so let me just rewrite that
example that I had up there.

00:44:15.855 --> 00:44:18.600 align:middle line:90%


00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:20.670 align:middle line:84%
If I define f of
x equals 1 over 1

00:44:20.670 --> 00:44:29.070 align:middle line:84%
minus x, fn of x to be in sum
from j equals 0 n end of xj,

00:44:29.070 --> 00:44:39.650 align:middle line:84%
then for all xn
minus 1 to 1, limit

00:44:39.650 --> 00:44:44.690 align:middle line:84%
as n goes to infinity of
fn of x equals f of x.

00:44:44.690 --> 00:44:45.560 align:middle line:90%
I.e.

00:44:45.560 --> 00:44:50.090 align:middle line:84%
this, the sequence of
partial sums corresponding

00:44:50.090 --> 00:44:52.370 align:middle line:84%
to this power series,
converges to 1 over 1

00:44:52.370 --> 00:44:57.110 align:middle line:84%
minus x point-wise
on minus 1, 1.

00:44:57.110 --> 00:45:07.658 align:middle line:90%


00:45:07.658 --> 00:45:09.700 align:middle line:84%
So I said, whenever you
come across a definition,

00:45:09.700 --> 00:45:10.840 align:middle line:90%
you should negate it.

00:45:10.840 --> 00:45:13.870 align:middle line:84%
But the negation
of this definition

00:45:13.870 --> 00:45:20.020 align:middle line:84%
is not too difficult.
A sequence of functions

00:45:20.020 --> 00:45:23.530 align:middle line:84%
does not converge to
another function point-wise

00:45:23.530 --> 00:45:25.090 align:middle line:84%
if there exists
some point, so that

00:45:25.090 --> 00:45:28.870 align:middle line:84%
when I stick them
into fn of x, fn of x

00:45:28.870 --> 00:45:30.580 align:middle line:90%
does not converge to f of x.

00:45:30.580 --> 00:45:37.940 align:middle line:90%


00:45:37.940 --> 00:45:39.920 align:middle line:84%
So let's look at
another example, which

00:45:39.920 --> 00:45:41.690 align:middle line:90%
is not a power series.

00:45:41.690 --> 00:45:48.730 align:middle line:84%
Let's say, we take fn
of x to be x to the n,

00:45:48.730 --> 00:45:54.560 align:middle line:84%
where x is in the
closed interval 0, 1.

00:45:54.560 --> 00:45:57.912 align:middle line:84%
So what's happening here,
as n gets very large,

00:45:57.912 --> 00:46:08.480 align:middle line:84%
there's 1, 1, there's,
I don't know, f 5 of x.

00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:10.610 align:middle line:84%
And then, as n gets
very large, these guys

00:46:10.610 --> 00:46:18.520 align:middle line:84%
are dropping down
even more and more.

00:46:18.520 --> 00:46:22.320 align:middle line:84%
And what is-- are we picking
up something in the limit?

00:46:22.320 --> 00:46:25.290 align:middle line:90%
Well, let's look.

00:46:25.290 --> 00:46:28.860 align:middle line:84%
Well, if x equals 1,
and it's pretty clear

00:46:28.860 --> 00:46:32.940 align:middle line:84%
that the limit as n goes
to infinity of fn of 1,

00:46:32.940 --> 00:46:34.530 align:middle line:90%
this equals 1.

00:46:34.530 --> 00:46:37.890 align:middle line:84%
If I stick in 1 here,
I get 1 for all n.

00:46:37.890 --> 00:46:42.630 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, the limit as n
goes to infinity of fn1 is 1.

00:46:42.630 --> 00:46:48.820 align:middle line:84%
Now, if x is in 0,
1, then, I mean,

00:46:48.820 --> 00:46:52.710 align:middle line:90%
we've done this limit before.

00:46:52.710 --> 00:46:55.320 align:middle line:84%
The limit as n goes to
infinity of fn of x, this

00:46:55.320 --> 00:46:59.430 align:middle line:84%
is equal to the limit as n
goes to infinity of x to the n.

00:46:59.430 --> 00:47:00.840 align:middle line:90%
Now, x is less than 1.

00:47:00.840 --> 00:47:04.000 align:middle line:84%
So x is being raised to a
higher and higher power.

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:04.710 align:middle line:90%
This equals 0.

00:47:04.710 --> 00:47:08.310 align:middle line:90%


00:47:08.310 --> 00:47:18.710 align:middle line:90%
Thus, what do we conclude?

00:47:18.710 --> 00:47:27.200 align:middle line:84%
For all x in 0, 1, this
sequence of functions x to the n

00:47:27.200 --> 00:47:29.930 align:middle line:84%
converges point-wise
to the function

00:47:29.930 --> 00:47:36.020 align:middle line:84%
f of x, which is
equal to 0 if x is

00:47:36.020 --> 00:47:44.990 align:middle line:90%
in 0, 1, and 1 if x equals 1.

00:47:44.990 --> 00:47:50.255 align:middle line:84%
So I draw another picture here
of what the limit looks like.

00:47:50.255 --> 00:48:00.830 align:middle line:90%


00:48:00.830 --> 00:48:03.670 align:middle line:84%
And you can start to see
this, as m gets large,

00:48:03.670 --> 00:48:06.070 align:middle line:84%
again, this is becoming
more vertical there.

00:48:06.070 --> 00:48:07.720 align:middle line:90%
But then going to 0.

00:48:07.720 --> 00:48:11.020 align:middle line:84%
So for any fixed
n, it's converging

00:48:11.020 --> 00:48:13.480 align:middle line:90%
to this picture on the right.

00:48:13.480 --> 00:48:19.060 align:middle line:84%
And so, we can already pick
up something, or at least

00:48:19.060 --> 00:48:25.030 align:middle line:84%
answer one of these
questions, if we take them

00:48:25.030 --> 00:48:32.760 align:middle line:84%
as a question about
convergence or functions

00:48:32.760 --> 00:48:35.610 align:middle line:90%
in the point-wise sense.

00:48:35.610 --> 00:48:37.860 align:middle line:84%
So we could have asked
this question now.

00:48:37.860 --> 00:48:40.260 align:middle line:84%
After having this
definition, suppose

00:48:40.260 --> 00:48:44.250 align:middle line:84%
fn's are continuous converging
point-wise to a function f.

00:48:44.250 --> 00:48:46.950 align:middle line:90%
Is the function f continuous?

00:48:46.950 --> 00:48:52.140 align:middle line:84%
And what this example shows is
that, no, that's not the case.

00:48:52.140 --> 00:48:55.020 align:middle line:90%
x to the n is always continuous.

00:48:55.020 --> 00:48:56.970 align:middle line:84%
Yet, the limit as
n goes to infinity,

00:48:56.970 --> 00:48:59.700 align:middle line:84%
the point-wise limit is
given by this function, which

00:48:59.700 --> 00:49:03.690 align:middle line:84%
is 0 from 0 to 1, and
1 at x equals 1, which

00:49:03.690 --> 00:49:05.070 align:middle line:90%
is not a continuous function.

00:49:05.070 --> 00:49:10.730 align:middle line:90%


00:49:10.730 --> 00:49:14.190 align:middle line:84%
So already, we're kind of seeing
that point-wise convergence,

00:49:14.190 --> 00:49:19.910 align:middle line:84%
which is this first
weakest mode of convergence

00:49:19.910 --> 00:49:24.990 align:middle line:84%
that we as of now can
say about power series

00:49:24.990 --> 00:49:28.170 align:middle line:84%
and is not good enough to
ensure that the limit is

00:49:28.170 --> 00:49:29.010 align:middle line:90%
even continuous.

00:49:29.010 --> 00:49:30.630 align:middle line:84%
Because this example
shows that we

00:49:30.630 --> 00:49:32.880 align:middle line:84%
have a sequence of
continuous functions

00:49:32.880 --> 00:49:35.580 align:middle line:84%
whose point-wise limit
is not continuous.

00:49:35.580 --> 00:49:50.950 align:middle line:90%


00:49:50.950 --> 00:49:55.540 align:middle line:84%
So as another example,
you should always--

00:49:55.540 --> 00:49:58.090 align:middle line:84%
I like this kind
of last chapter,

00:49:58.090 --> 00:50:01.540 align:middle line:84%
because you can draw
a lot of pictures.

00:50:01.540 --> 00:50:04.960 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to
draw pictures of fn.

00:50:04.960 --> 00:50:08.230 align:middle line:90%
So it's piece-wise linear.

00:50:08.230 --> 00:50:11.117 align:middle line:84%
So I can write down
what the function is,

00:50:11.117 --> 00:50:11.950 align:middle line:90%
but I don't want to.

00:50:11.950 --> 00:50:13.325 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to
draw a picture.

00:50:13.325 --> 00:50:19.090 align:middle line:90%
So fn of x from 0, 1 to R.

00:50:19.090 --> 00:50:21.380 align:middle line:90%
This is how it looks.

00:50:21.380 --> 00:50:24.230 align:middle line:90%
So there's 1, 1.

00:50:24.230 --> 00:50:29.390 align:middle line:84%
And what I do is, I go
to the point, 1 over n.

00:50:29.390 --> 00:50:34.730 align:middle line:84%
And the function fn of
x is 0 up until then.

00:50:34.730 --> 00:50:40.160 align:middle line:84%
And then, it's a linear function
connecting 1 over n to 2n here.

00:50:40.160 --> 00:50:44.280 align:middle line:90%


00:50:44.280 --> 00:50:49.380 align:middle line:84%
And then it's connects
this point to n0, so

00:50:49.380 --> 00:50:56.000 align:middle line:84%
or I should say, 1 over 2n, 2n,
connects that to the origin.

00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:59.260 align:middle line:90%
So that's f sub n of x.

00:50:59.260 --> 00:51:00.450 align:middle line:90%
It's just piece-wise linear.

00:51:00.450 --> 00:51:06.520 align:middle line:84%
So for example, if
I want to draw f1,

00:51:06.520 --> 00:51:13.480 align:middle line:84%
f1 would look like
there's 1, 0, 2, 1/2.

00:51:13.480 --> 00:51:20.520 align:middle line:90%


00:51:20.520 --> 00:51:23.460 align:middle line:84%
And let's say I
wanted to draw f 100.

00:51:23.460 --> 00:51:24.555 align:middle line:90%
What does that look like?

00:51:24.555 --> 00:51:27.280 align:middle line:90%


00:51:27.280 --> 00:51:29.790 align:middle line:84%
So maybe I should make this
one a little bit bigger.

00:51:29.790 --> 00:51:37.100 align:middle line:84%
There's 1, 1 over 100, and
then that should be 1 over 200.

00:51:37.100 --> 00:51:56.780 align:middle line:84%
And then if I go up to 200,
is this piece-wise linear

00:51:56.780 --> 00:52:01.208 align:middle line:90%
function, which is getting--

00:52:01.208 --> 00:52:04.890 align:middle line:90%


00:52:04.890 --> 00:52:08.250 align:middle line:90%
it's 0 from 1 up to 1 over 100.

00:52:08.250 --> 00:52:09.660 align:middle line:90%
So it's 0 most of the time.

00:52:09.660 --> 00:52:11.880 align:middle line:90%
And it's 0 at the origin.

00:52:11.880 --> 00:52:14.745 align:middle line:84%
But in between, it's
very tall and very slim.

00:52:14.745 --> 00:52:19.080 align:middle line:90%


00:52:19.080 --> 00:52:29.975 align:middle line:84%
And so, my claim is
that for all x in 0,

00:52:29.975 --> 00:52:40.480 align:middle line:84%
1, limit as n goes to
infinity of fn of x equals 0.

00:52:40.480 --> 00:52:44.530 align:middle line:84%
So this sequence of functions
converges point-wise to 0.

00:52:44.530 --> 00:52:51.570 align:middle line:90%


00:52:51.570 --> 00:52:53.160 align:middle line:90%
So why is this?

00:52:53.160 --> 00:52:56.090 align:middle line:90%


00:52:56.090 --> 00:53:00.100 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's just give
a full proof of this

00:53:00.100 --> 00:53:02.470 align:middle line:90%
rather than me talking it out.

00:53:02.470 --> 00:53:05.655 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'll talk it out
and give a full proof.

00:53:05.655 --> 00:53:11.960 align:middle line:90%


00:53:11.960 --> 00:53:15.185 align:middle line:84%
So let's look at the
easiest spot first.

00:53:15.185 --> 00:53:18.200 align:middle line:90%


00:53:18.200 --> 00:53:21.540 align:middle line:84%
And I don't even need the
formula for these guys.

00:53:21.540 --> 00:53:24.710 align:middle line:84%
I just need to know that they
have this basic characteristic

00:53:24.710 --> 00:53:26.720 align:middle line:84%
that their point-wise
linear, I mean,

00:53:26.720 --> 00:53:28.970 align:middle line:84%
that they're piece-wise
linear connecting

00:53:28.970 --> 00:53:36.000 align:middle line:84%
0 to 1 over 2n and 2n here,
and then down to 1 over n 0.

00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:40.490 align:middle line:84%
And then, there's 0
between that and 1.

00:53:40.490 --> 00:53:48.050 align:middle line:84%
So first off, if x equals
0, then all these functions

00:53:48.050 --> 00:53:52.915 align:middle line:90%
are 0 at the origin.

00:53:52.915 --> 00:53:57.394 align:middle line:90%


00:53:57.394 --> 00:53:58.600 align:middle line:90%
So they equals 0.

00:53:58.600 --> 00:54:00.400 align:middle line:90%
So that equals 0.

00:54:00.400 --> 00:54:02.150 align:middle line:90%
So that's fine.

00:54:02.150 --> 00:54:07.960 align:middle line:90%
So now suppose x is in 0, 1.

00:54:07.960 --> 00:54:11.750 align:middle line:90%


00:54:11.750 --> 00:54:13.175 align:middle line:90%
And so, what do we want to show?

00:54:13.175 --> 00:54:22.300 align:middle line:90%


00:54:22.300 --> 00:54:26.070 align:middle line:84%
I want to show limit
as n goes to infinity

00:54:26.070 --> 00:54:31.100 align:middle line:90%
of fn of x equals 0.

00:54:31.100 --> 00:54:34.020 align:middle line:84%
And here, so what's
the point here?

00:54:34.020 --> 00:54:41.350 align:middle line:90%
Now, there's 1, there's x.

00:54:41.350 --> 00:54:42.970 align:middle line:90%
So I have to give a--

00:54:42.970 --> 00:54:47.790 align:middle line:90%


00:54:47.790 --> 00:54:52.730 align:middle line:84%
well, I'm not even going to
do an epsilon delta epsilon M

00:54:52.730 --> 00:54:53.230 align:middle line:90%
argument.

00:54:53.230 --> 00:54:56.480 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to
show you what happens.

00:54:56.480 --> 00:55:01.650 align:middle line:90%
So there's x between 0 and 1.

00:55:01.650 --> 00:55:10.790 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's choose a very
large integer so that 1 over M

00:55:10.790 --> 00:55:13.980 align:middle line:90%
is less than x.

00:55:13.980 --> 00:55:18.315 align:middle line:84%
So here's 1 over M to
strictly to the left of x.

00:55:18.315 --> 00:55:21.270 align:middle line:90%


00:55:21.270 --> 00:55:23.940 align:middle line:84%
Now, what is the
graph of fn of x

00:55:23.940 --> 00:55:28.380 align:middle line:84%
look like for n bigger
than or equal to M?

00:55:28.380 --> 00:55:33.750 align:middle line:84%
It's 0 from x equals
1 to x equal 1 over M,

00:55:33.750 --> 00:55:38.700 align:middle line:84%
and then shoots up, and then
comes back down over here to 0.

00:55:38.700 --> 00:55:40.020 align:middle line:90%
But here's the point.

00:55:40.020 --> 00:55:43.620 align:middle line:84%
It's 0 all the way from 1 to
1 over M. So in particular,

00:55:43.620 --> 00:55:47.850 align:middle line:90%
at x, fn of x is 0.

00:55:47.850 --> 00:55:55.960 align:middle line:84%
So if I look at
this sequence, fn

00:55:55.960 --> 00:56:00.400 align:middle line:84%
of x, which I'm trying to
show converges to 0, it is 0--

00:56:00.400 --> 00:56:10.590 align:middle line:84%
no, it is a f1 of x, f2 of
x, up to fn minus 1 of x.

00:56:10.590 --> 00:56:18.300 align:middle line:84%
And then, at fM
of x, so at the--

00:56:18.300 --> 00:56:25.570 align:middle line:84%
now, so this is fM
of x spot, it's 0.

00:56:25.570 --> 00:56:27.770 align:middle line:84%
And this point is only
going to the left.

00:56:27.770 --> 00:56:31.450 align:middle line:84%
So for all n bigger
than or equal to M,

00:56:31.450 --> 00:56:34.960 align:middle line:84%
now this will be 1 over n
will be to the left of x.

00:56:34.960 --> 00:56:38.710 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, fn
of x will be 0.

00:56:38.710 --> 00:56:43.780 align:middle line:84%
So this is 0, 0,
0, 0, and so on.

00:56:43.780 --> 00:56:51.160 align:middle line:90%


00:56:51.160 --> 00:56:55.810 align:middle line:84%
So I have the sequence
is eventually 0

00:56:55.810 --> 00:57:06.750 align:middle line:84%
for all n bigger than or
equal to capital M. So

00:57:06.750 --> 00:57:08.160 align:middle line:84%
and therefore,
the limit, I mean,

00:57:08.160 --> 00:57:10.493 align:middle line:84%
it's pretty easy to take a
limit of a constant sequence.

00:57:10.493 --> 00:57:16.050 align:middle line:90%


00:57:16.050 --> 00:57:20.130 align:middle line:84%
And which proves that
this sequence of functions

00:57:20.130 --> 00:57:21.885 align:middle line:90%
converges point-wise to 0.

00:57:21.885 --> 00:57:24.945 align:middle line:90%


00:57:24.945 --> 00:57:26.820 align:middle line:84%
Now, I didn't come up
with this fancy example

00:57:26.820 --> 00:57:28.782 align:middle line:90%
for just any old reason.

00:57:28.782 --> 00:57:30.240 align:middle line:84%
It'll come back in
a minute when we

00:57:30.240 --> 00:57:31.907 align:middle line:84%
start answering some
of these questions,

00:57:31.907 --> 00:57:37.140 align:middle line:84%
or asking them, again, within
the context of these two

00:57:37.140 --> 00:57:38.280 align:middle line:90%
convergence--

00:57:38.280 --> 00:57:43.750 align:middle line:90%


00:57:43.750 --> 00:57:45.160 align:middle line:90%
ways of converging.

00:57:45.160 --> 00:57:48.140 align:middle line:90%


00:57:48.140 --> 00:57:51.170 align:middle line:84%
So, so far, I've only
given you one definition

00:57:51.170 --> 00:57:53.000 align:middle line:84%
of convergence--
point-wise convergence

00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:54.205 align:middle line:90%
of a sequence of functions.

00:57:54.205 --> 00:57:55.830 align:middle line:84%
And now, I'm going
to give a slightly--

00:57:55.830 --> 00:57:57.872 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to give a
stronger-- it's not slightly,

00:57:57.872 --> 00:58:00.020 align:middle line:90%
it's much stronger--

00:58:00.020 --> 00:58:05.820 align:middle line:84%
definition of convergence
of a sequence of functions.

00:58:05.820 --> 00:58:21.050 align:middle line:84%
So we have a sequence of
functions and a given function

00:58:21.050 --> 00:58:24.290 align:middle line:84%
from S to R. S is a
non-empty subset of R.

00:58:24.290 --> 00:58:39.580 align:middle line:84%
Then we say the sequence
fn converges point-wise

00:58:39.580 --> 00:58:42.760 align:middle line:90%
or uniformly to 0--

00:58:42.760 --> 00:58:45.810 align:middle line:90%
uniformly to 0-- uniformly to--

00:58:45.810 --> 00:58:46.810 align:middle line:90%
it's the end of the day.

00:58:46.810 --> 00:58:49.148 align:middle line:84%
If I start mixing
up some of my words,

00:58:49.148 --> 00:58:50.440 align:middle line:90%
I'm always going to correct it.

00:58:50.440 --> 00:58:51.880 align:middle line:84%
But the first word
out of my mouth

00:58:51.880 --> 00:58:53.860 align:middle line:90%
may not be the correct one--

00:58:53.860 --> 00:59:03.170 align:middle line:84%
converges uniformly
to f of x to f if--

00:59:03.170 --> 00:59:06.710 align:middle line:84%
now we have an
epsilon in statement.

00:59:06.710 --> 00:59:12.380 align:middle line:84%
For all epsilon positive, there
exists an M natural number

00:59:12.380 --> 00:59:21.152 align:middle line:84%
such that for all n bigger than
or equal to M, for all x in S,

00:59:21.152 --> 00:59:26.905 align:middle line:84%
fn of x minus f of x
is less than epsilon.

00:59:26.905 --> 00:59:31.580 align:middle line:90%


00:59:31.580 --> 00:59:34.400 align:middle line:84%
Now, I want to make
a brief comment.

00:59:34.400 --> 00:59:37.670 align:middle line:84%
This looks suspiciously
like point-wise convergence,

00:59:37.670 --> 00:59:41.750 align:middle line:84%
if you just wrote down
what it means for the limit

00:59:41.750 --> 00:59:45.560 align:middle line:84%
as n goes to infinity of
fn of x goes to f of x.

00:59:45.560 --> 00:59:49.550 align:middle line:84%
Except, there's a very
subtle and important point.

00:59:49.550 --> 00:59:53.450 align:middle line:84%
And that is, where does
for all x and S appear?

00:59:53.450 --> 00:59:56.150 align:middle line:84%
For point-wise
convergence, you can

00:59:56.150 --> 00:59:59.990 align:middle line:84%
state point-wise
convergence as this

00:59:59.990 --> 01:00:02.660 align:middle line:84%
being at the start of
the line, for all x

01:00:02.660 --> 01:00:08.100 align:middle line:84%
in S, for all epsilon
positive, blah, blah, blah.

01:00:08.100 --> 01:00:12.540 align:middle line:84%
Here, it appears at the end of
the line of the quantifiers.

01:00:12.540 --> 01:00:15.450 align:middle line:84%
And this makes a very
important difference

01:00:15.450 --> 01:00:18.870 align:middle line:84%
between point-wise convergence
and uniform convergence.

01:00:18.870 --> 01:00:22.860 align:middle line:84%
Point-wise convergence
means, I take a point x,

01:00:22.860 --> 01:00:24.570 align:middle line:90%
I stick it into fn of x.

01:00:24.570 --> 01:00:27.020 align:middle line:84%
That gives me a
sequence of numbers.

01:00:27.020 --> 01:00:29.870 align:middle line:84%
And point-wise convergence
says that sequence of numbers

01:00:29.870 --> 01:00:31.910 align:middle line:90%
converges to f of x.

01:00:31.910 --> 01:00:34.800 align:middle line:84%
For each x, I get a
sequence of numbers,

01:00:34.800 --> 01:00:36.230 align:middle line:90%
which converges to f of x.

01:00:36.230 --> 01:00:40.458 align:middle line:90%


01:00:40.458 --> 01:00:42.530 align:middle line:84%
Now, uniform
convergence is actually

01:00:42.530 --> 01:00:43.820 align:middle line:90%
saying something stronger.

01:00:43.820 --> 01:00:46.190 align:middle line:90%
And I'll say that.

01:00:46.190 --> 01:00:51.650 align:middle line:84%
So let me, in fact, let
me draw a picture that

01:00:51.650 --> 01:00:53.990 align:middle line:90%
goes with this definition.

01:00:53.990 --> 01:00:57.245 align:middle line:90%
Let's make S to be an interval.

01:00:57.245 --> 01:01:01.560 align:middle line:90%


01:01:01.560 --> 01:01:06.730 align:middle line:84%
Let's say my limiting function
is f is given by this graph.

01:01:06.730 --> 01:01:16.570 align:middle line:84%
And so, what I'm going
to do is basically

01:01:16.570 --> 01:01:31.790 align:middle line:84%
shift the graph up
and down by epsilon,

01:01:31.790 --> 01:01:36.520 align:middle line:84%
meaning this length is
epsilon, and so is this length,

01:01:36.520 --> 01:01:37.760 align:middle line:90%
all the way across.

01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:46.950 align:middle line:84%
So let me shade this
in and re-outline--

01:01:46.950 --> 01:01:47.450 align:middle line:90%
oh.

01:01:47.450 --> 01:01:55.070 align:middle line:90%


01:01:55.070 --> 01:02:02.750 align:middle line:84%
So I get this little,
if you like, shaded area

01:02:02.750 --> 01:02:05.390 align:middle line:90%
around my function f.

01:02:05.390 --> 01:02:08.990 align:middle line:90%
So this is f, f of x.

01:02:08.990 --> 01:02:10.010 align:middle line:90%
That's the graph.

01:02:10.010 --> 01:02:15.920 align:middle line:84%
And the shaded part, this
is the set of all x and y,

01:02:15.920 --> 01:02:23.090 align:middle line:84%
such that f of x minus
y is less than epsilon.

01:02:23.090 --> 01:02:27.290 align:middle line:84%
So I get a little
tube snaking with f.

01:02:27.290 --> 01:02:29.690 align:middle line:84%
Now, what uniform
convergence says,

01:02:29.690 --> 01:02:35.510 align:middle line:84%
is that for all n bigger than
or equal to some M, so given

01:02:35.510 --> 01:02:38.360 align:middle line:84%
epsilon, for all n bigger
than or equal to M, if I were

01:02:38.360 --> 01:02:43.810 align:middle line:84%
to draw the graph of
fn of x, it better

01:02:43.810 --> 01:02:51.375 align:middle line:84%
fall inside this tube
across all of a, b.

01:02:51.375 --> 01:02:54.660 align:middle line:84%
See, this tube is defined
for all x between a, b.

01:02:54.660 --> 01:03:03.080 align:middle line:84%
So it's making a statement
about how close fn of x

01:03:03.080 --> 01:03:08.150 align:middle line:84%
is to f of x across
the entire set.

01:03:08.150 --> 01:03:11.630 align:middle line:84%
Point-wise convergence just
says, if I put an x into fn

01:03:11.630 --> 01:03:14.990 align:middle line:84%
of x, then eventually
those numbers

01:03:14.990 --> 01:03:16.590 align:middle line:90%
are getting close to f of x.

01:03:16.590 --> 01:03:19.220 align:middle line:84%
Uniform convergence
is a global property.

01:03:19.220 --> 01:03:23.960 align:middle line:84%
It's saying, across the entire
set, as n is getting large,

01:03:23.960 --> 01:03:26.510 align:middle line:84%
the graph of this
fn is getting very

01:03:26.510 --> 01:03:28.780 align:middle line:90%
close to the graph of f of x.

01:03:28.780 --> 01:03:35.430 align:middle line:84%
Not just if I fix an x,
the fn of x at that point

01:03:35.430 --> 01:03:38.730 align:middle line:90%
are converging to f of x.

01:03:38.730 --> 01:03:42.300 align:middle line:84%
So I've said a couple of
times that uniform convergence

01:03:42.300 --> 01:03:44.230 align:middle line:84%
is stronger than
point-wise convergence.

01:03:44.230 --> 01:03:49.740 align:middle line:90%
Let me actually prove this now.

01:03:49.740 --> 01:03:52.860 align:middle line:84%
So let me prove that
following theorem.

01:03:52.860 --> 01:03:59.850 align:middle line:90%


01:03:59.850 --> 01:04:08.250 align:middle line:84%
So if I have a sequence
of functions from S to R,

01:04:08.250 --> 01:04:12.990 align:middle line:84%
and fn, rather than
write converges

01:04:12.990 --> 01:04:17.190 align:middle line:84%
to f point-wise or uniformly,
I'm going to put an arrow.

01:04:17.190 --> 01:04:28.790 align:middle line:84%
And then, with the description
afterwards, uniformly on S.

01:04:28.790 --> 01:04:39.290 align:middle line:84%
And then this implies fn
converges to f point-wise on S.

01:04:39.290 --> 01:04:42.020 align:middle line:90%
So it's very simple.

01:04:42.020 --> 01:04:44.720 align:middle line:84%
Again, what is
the picture that's

01:04:44.720 --> 01:04:47.090 align:middle line:84%
going on for uniform
convergence is

01:04:47.090 --> 01:04:51.433 align:middle line:84%
that fn is getting close
to f across the entire set

01:04:51.433 --> 01:04:52.350 align:middle line:90%
that we're looking at.

01:04:52.350 --> 01:04:54.710 align:middle line:84%
So certainly at one
point, which is all

01:04:54.710 --> 01:04:56.240 align:middle line:84%
you need for
point-wise convergence.

01:04:56.240 --> 01:04:58.790 align:middle line:84%
Each fixed point we
should be getting close.

01:04:58.790 --> 01:05:03.600 align:middle line:90%
So let epsilon be positive.

01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:12.330 align:middle line:84%
So first off, let's fix
a number in the set S.

01:05:12.330 --> 01:05:18.380 align:middle line:84%
So now we want to prove
that the limit as n

01:05:18.380 --> 01:05:22.370 align:middle line:84%
goes to infinity of
fn of c equals f of c.

01:05:22.370 --> 01:05:26.860 align:middle line:90%


01:05:26.860 --> 01:05:30.370 align:middle line:90%
Let epsilon be positive.

01:05:30.370 --> 01:05:36.280 align:middle line:84%
Since fn converges
to f uniformly,

01:05:36.280 --> 01:05:44.560 align:middle line:84%
there exists a natural
number M0 such that

01:05:44.560 --> 01:05:49.920 align:middle line:84%
for all n bigger than or
equal to M0, for all x in S,

01:05:49.920 --> 01:05:55.480 align:middle line:84%
fn of x minus f of x
is less than epsilon.

01:05:55.480 --> 01:05:58.220 align:middle line:90%


01:05:58.220 --> 01:06:06.740 align:middle line:84%
So choose M to be this M0, the
M that is for this epsilon.

01:06:06.740 --> 01:06:12.940 align:middle line:84%
Then for all n bigger
than or equal to M,

01:06:12.940 --> 01:06:21.710 align:middle line:84%
let's call this equation star,
star with at the single point

01:06:21.710 --> 01:06:28.910 align:middle line:84%
x equals at c, implies
fn of c minus f of c

01:06:28.910 --> 01:06:31.700 align:middle line:90%
is less than epsilon.

01:06:31.700 --> 01:06:34.930 align:middle line:84%
And thus, the limit as n goes
to infinity of f of c, fn of c

01:06:34.930 --> 01:06:35.860 align:middle line:90%
equals f of c.

01:06:35.860 --> 01:06:51.650 align:middle line:90%


01:06:51.650 --> 01:06:56.090 align:middle line:84%
So I don't think I have
enough time to do the example

01:06:56.090 --> 01:06:56.910 align:middle line:90%
that I want to do.

01:06:56.910 --> 01:06:58.910 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just going to leave
you on the edge of your seat

01:06:58.910 --> 01:07:00.500 align:middle line:84%
by stating the
following theorem.

01:07:00.500 --> 01:07:04.760 align:middle line:84%
That in fact, so this
is a one-way street.

01:07:04.760 --> 01:07:08.060 align:middle line:84%
Meaning point-wise
convergence does not

01:07:08.060 --> 01:07:09.350 align:middle line:90%
imply uniform convergence.

01:07:09.350 --> 01:07:11.870 align:middle line:84%
So we just proved uniform
implies point-wise.

01:07:11.870 --> 01:07:14.420 align:middle line:90%
But the converse does not hold.

01:07:14.420 --> 01:07:16.250 align:middle line:84%
And what we'll
prove next time is

01:07:16.250 --> 01:07:23.080 align:middle line:84%
for in the setting of this
simple example of x to the n.

01:07:23.080 --> 01:07:52.240 align:middle line:84%
So-- and so, what we'll prove
next time is the following.

01:07:52.240 --> 01:07:55.350 align:middle line:90%


01:07:55.350 --> 01:08:02.630 align:middle line:84%
If I take any b
between 0 and 1, then

01:08:02.630 --> 01:08:09.680 align:middle line:84%
fn convergence to f
uniformly on the set 0, b.

01:08:09.680 --> 01:08:11.630 align:middle line:84%
So these functions
are defined on 0, 1.

01:08:11.630 --> 01:08:15.910 align:middle line:84%
So they're certainly defined
on 0, b for b less than 1.

01:08:15.910 --> 01:08:30.330 align:middle line:84%
But however, this
sequence of functions

01:08:30.330 --> 01:08:44.830 align:middle line:84%
does not converge
uniformly to f on 0,1.

01:08:44.830 --> 01:08:50.200 align:middle line:84%
So here, this second part,
since the fn's converge

01:08:50.200 --> 01:08:53.170 align:middle line:84%
to point-wise on 0,
1, the second part

01:08:53.170 --> 01:08:55.600 align:middle line:84%
says that this is
a one-way street.

01:08:55.600 --> 01:08:57.910 align:middle line:90%
This is not a two-way street.

01:08:57.910 --> 01:09:03.029 align:middle line:84%
These two modes of
convergence-- uniform

01:09:03.029 --> 01:09:07.229 align:middle line:84%
convergence and point-wise
are not equivalent.

01:09:07.229 --> 01:09:07.729 align:middle line:90%
All right.

01:09:07.729 --> 01:09:09.880 align:middle line:90%
I think we'll stop there.

01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:16.000 align:middle line:90%

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.120
PHILIP GREENSPUN: All right,
so a complicated aircraft

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:20.930
will have a lot of systems.

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:23.200
These are the systems from
the Canadair Regional Jet.

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:29.630
How well did that I fly it?

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.259
We landed it once in Toronto,
and I was doing this,

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:34.140
and the captain
said to me, well--

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.020
he was a young guy--

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.660
he said, well, you know nobody
was born knowing how to fly

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.570
a 53,000-pound jet.

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:42.260
But anyway, this is
the kind of stuff

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.570
you have to learn
for the big aircraft.

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.400
Here are these
systems that we're

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.695
going to talk about that you
have on a small aircraft.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.160
The engine, first of
all, what are the types?

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.520
You might remember
the cool old days.

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.340
You had these big
radio engines, and they

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.540
went up to 3,500 horsepower,
I think, was the biggest one.

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.489
But your typical
World War Ii fighter

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.730
might have a 2000
horsepower-ish radial engine.

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:11.610
Turboprops, so we'll
get into this more.

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.450
I have a special lecture on
turbines and multi-engine.

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.680
But it's a jet engine that's
hooked into a propeller,

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.250
and that lets you land
on shorter runways,

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.390
and it's more fuel-efficient
at lower altitudes.

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.150
The popular examples,
the Pratt & Whitney PT6

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.600
has been around since the 50s.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.210
A competitor from the similar
era was designed by Garrett.

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.370
Those have typically
slugged it out.

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:43.080
One of them is a free
turbine, so you have the PT6.

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.410
And this is a GE Walter
derivative, that they now

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:48.630
call the GE Advanced Turboprop.

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.640
So the cold air comes in.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.730
It gets burned.

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:58.920
And the hot exhaust
gases spin this power

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.020
turbine which has a shaft
that drives the compressor.

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.330
And it also goes back this way.

00:02:10.544 --> 00:02:12.090
There's a second.

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.460
I think one of them
drives the compressor,

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.530
and there's a second
wheel there that

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.120
is exposed to the hot gases and
it will drive the propeller.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.780
So there's kind of a fluid
coupling there through the air.

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:30.540
Whereas the Garrett Honeywell
product has a direct drive

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.775
transmission that's more
complicated but also

00:02:32.775 --> 00:02:34.150
a little bit more
fuel-efficient.

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.470
So those are the
two big designs.

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.940
You get a lot more
reliability with a turboprop

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.060
if you need power.

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.590
It's hard to make a piston
engine reliable if it generates

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.270
a lot of horsepower.

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.360
The disadvantage is
nobody's really figured out

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.300
how to make these things
for less than half a million

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.680
dollars new in a box.

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.790
And the most popular
airframes for the turboprop

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.970
for things that you might
fly, the Beechcraft King

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.330
Air which is twin-engine,
and the Pilatus

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.410
PC-12 which is a single.

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.850
Turbojets, which-- well, the
FAA calls them turbojets.

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:14.790
They're really turbofans
because of the bypass air.

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.710
We'll see that in
the next slide.

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:19.710
These are-- one thing
to remember about them

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:21.070
is they're normally aspirated.

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:23.520
They actually do produce
less and less power

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.950
as you get up to
higher altitudes which

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:30.900
is important for taking off, you
know, in Colorado on a hot day.

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.270
You have much lower
noise and vibration--

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:36.390
maybe not if you mount one
of them right over your ear.

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.490
That's a Cirrus
jet which is kind

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:43.470
of a cool simple personal jet.

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.170
They actually have sort of
taken over the market starting

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:49.680
in model airplanes going all
the way up to the Boeing's

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:50.760
and the airbuses.

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.690
And the only gap where
turbojets have not taken over

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.850
is in your family
airplane, right?

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:58.890
Your four-seater,
your six-seater,

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:00.690
that's where
nobody's figured out

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.090
how to make a
turbojet that really

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.060
makes economic sense or
even sense for the range.

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:10.050
They tend not to be as efficient
at these low-power settings.

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:13.600
The smaller the turbojet, the
less efficient it has been,

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:14.860
unfortunately.

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:16.529
So you wouldn't get
the kind of range

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:18.660
that you'd get out of
a Cirrus or a Cessna

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:22.060
if you stuck a jet
engine in there.

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:23.410
These are more vulnerable.

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:27.750
A bird will usually just get
Cuisinarted by a propeller,

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:32.160
but if it goes into the jet
engine then it can destroy it.

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:37.190
So the single-engine jet,
well, some single-engine jets

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:39.980
like fighters they should
have an ejection seat.

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:42.560
The Cirrus single-engine
jet has a parachute

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.170
for the whole aircraft
to float you down.

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:48.290
All right, turbojet, again,
this is not really on the exam

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:50.015
but it's just good
general knowledge.

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:54.410
The fresh air, it comes in here.

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:56.030
It gets compressed
by the compressor.

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:57.800
Once again, that's
normal aspiration,

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.660
and so it's just a
fixed-compression ratio.

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:03.970
It doesn't get more extreme
like with the turbocharger

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:06.260
in a piston engine
at higher altitude.

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:07.547
Notice this bypass air.

00:05:07.547 --> 00:05:09.380
It's being spun, and
that blade in the front

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:12.730
is really acting
like a propeller.

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:15.350
Here is where the compressed
air gets burned and drives

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:19.340
these power turbines
that drive the compressor

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:20.990
and the fan in front.

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:23.840
So it seems like a
really simple design,

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:27.990
but there's a tremendous amount
of engineering in the blades.

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:31.040
And if anything is fabricated
just slightly wrong, you know,

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:33.450
the whole thing comes
apart and explodes.

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:35.360
So that's one reason
I think they're

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:40.560
in the million-dollar range for
a typical business jet engine.

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:43.080
All right, so let's go
back to our world, which,

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:46.770
unfortunately, is going to be
the reciprocating piston engine

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:48.460
kind of like in your car.

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:51.023
The designs-- I don't know--

00:05:51.023 --> 00:05:52.440
the fundamentalists
may or may not

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:54.065
have changed that
much since the Wright

00:05:54.065 --> 00:05:56.880
brothers, but
certainly, the designs

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.860
that are in your modern
Cessna or a Piper--

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:01.700
the basic geometry,
the engine design--

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:03.625
is really all from the 1950s.

00:06:03.625 --> 00:06:06.000
The good news is that with
numerically-controlled machine

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.620
tools and such,
they're much more

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:09.960
reliable than they used to be.

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:12.450
Engine failure was
an everyday event

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:14.340
at a busy airport
in the old days.

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:18.390
And now, you know, I've
flown for, I don't know,

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:23.190
4,000-plus hours with Pistons
and have never had any kind

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:24.900
of real engine problem.

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:28.060
The horizontal opposition
supposedly smooths things out.

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:30.300
They may ask you about
that on the test.

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:32.880
Like the turbojet, it's
normally aspirated,

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:35.640
so the performance
degrades as you

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:40.020
go to hot and high elevations
where the air is thinner.

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:44.160
We'll talk about that in the
performance calculations.

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:46.830
You directly drive
the propeller.

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:50.220
So if the engine's
spinning at 2,500 RPM,

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:52.140
the propeller's
spinning at 2,500 RPM.

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:54.370
There's no transmission.

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:57.420
The cooling is the air,
it's called air-cooled.

00:06:57.420 --> 00:06:59.610
And the air flows
over the cylinders,

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:01.980
but there's also a lot of
oil circulating which has

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:05.770
a significant cooling function.

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:07.990
The lowest cost and
simplest airplanes

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:11.080
have a carburetor rather
than fuel injection.

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:15.100
And you'll get 200
horsepower or less out of a--

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:16.840
well, I guess the
latest Lycoming's can

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:20.080
do to 215 out of a 4-cylinder.

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:22.290
You can get a
little bit fancier.

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:24.860
A plane like a Cirrus
or the latest Cessnas

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:26.920
will have fuel injection.

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:29.960
Turbocharging sounds like the
ideal thing for an aircraft.

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:32.380
Why wouldn't you want
that for a machine that

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:35.500
goes through airs of all
kinds of different densities?

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:36.940
It seems like the ideal thing.

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:39.250
Just make the density
back to sea level at least

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:42.550
all the time, which is
called turbo-normalization.

00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:46.270
The problem is that
they share an oil system

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:49.150
with the rest of the engine, so
when the turbocharger breaks,

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:51.745
it tends to cause all of the
oil to leak out of the engine.

00:07:51.745 --> 00:07:52.870
And now you have a broken--

00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:55.090
you know, what had been
a perfectly good engine

00:07:55.090 --> 00:07:59.440
with a broken turbocharger
becomes a real emergency.

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:02.170
So people's-- you know, except
out west where you really need

00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:05.380
the performance because
you are going up high a lot

00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:09.070
or you're starting
from high and hot,

00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:11.452
the turbochargers
tend to be unpopular,

00:08:11.452 --> 00:08:13.285
although it's an ideal
engineering solution.

00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:18.500
The more cylinders also
the less vibration,

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:20.560
so if you have higher
horsepower or if you just

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:21.820
want it to be smooth.

00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:23.860
Like the original
SR20s came with

00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:25.750
six-cylinder,
200-horsepower engines

00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:27.940
because they wanted
it to be smoother.

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:33.280
Rotax is the most popular
engine in the light sport

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:34.890
and experimental world.

00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:38.159
That's an engine that's a little
bit more like a car engine.

00:08:38.159 --> 00:08:39.690
It revs pretty high.

00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:45.120
It's got a water-cooling
radiator with antifreeze

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:50.790
and the transmission gears that
prop down to a lower speed.

00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:52.620
All right, here's
your basic engine.

00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:02.140
So up here in the
cylinder head, you

00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:05.950
have your intake, an exhaust
valve, and your spark plug.

00:09:05.950 --> 00:09:09.880
Down here, there's the
crankcase and crankshaft.

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:17.530
Here's an exciting-- this
is kind of an inline-four,

00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:21.408
but you get an idea
of the power strokes.

00:09:21.408 --> 00:09:23.200
Everybody used to know
this in the old days

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:25.488
because they were
excited about cars,

00:09:25.488 --> 00:09:27.280
so they had a lot of
car-related knowledge,

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:28.820
and it's basically
the same idea.

00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:33.190
But now in the Uber age, we
can't take that for granted.

00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:37.600
So you've got your
intake stroke top left,

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:40.550
and then the cylinder.

00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:45.910
The piston is pushed back up to
compress the air-fuel mixture.

00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:47.440
The spark plugs ignite.

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:50.140
Notice how there's
two of them here.

00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:53.830
That gives you some redundancy
as well as more uniformity

00:09:53.830 --> 00:09:58.390
of combustion, which pushes
the piston back down generating

00:09:58.390 --> 00:09:59.290
the power.

00:09:59.290 --> 00:10:01.750
And then finally,
the piston rotates up

00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:02.720
and pushes the air out.

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:04.553
I think this might be
called the Otto cycle.

00:10:04.553 --> 00:10:07.000
I think a German
guy invented this--

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.060
or actually, a French
guy patented it first,

00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:13.150
but maybe Otto reduced
it to practice first.

00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:16.360
But anyway, it's a European
invention from the late 1800s,

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:19.180
and it really hasn't
changed much--

00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:20.690
four-stroke cycle.

00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:25.230
OK, cooling, as I said it's
a combination of the air

00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:27.150
and the oil circulation.

00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:31.290
The FAA wants you to know that
if you're getting the engine

00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:32.285
is going hot--

00:10:32.285 --> 00:10:33.660
again, this is
probably not going

00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:35.680
to happen to you here at level.

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:39.810
But if you're climbing in your
little airplane out of Wyoming

00:10:39.810 --> 00:10:41.970
on a hot day, you
might end up having

00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:46.505
to accept a slightly
lower climb rate,

00:10:46.505 --> 00:10:47.880
boost your airspeed
a little bit,

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:51.660
and lower the nose to
get more cooling air.

00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:54.150
The mixture control, you
don't see this in cars

00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:55.770
because they have
automatic systems

00:10:55.770 --> 00:10:59.760
to adjust the air-fuel
mixture and get

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:01.920
the right amount of fuel
in there corresponding

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:06.060
to the density of the air.

00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:09.450
But in aviation, you know
there's your little mixture

00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:12.060
knob where you can
lean out the mixture.

00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:18.730
The fuel-air mixture,
you start out

00:11:18.730 --> 00:11:21.040
rich when you're taking
off because you're

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:23.980
at a very high power setting,
and the extra rich mixture

00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:26.680
cools the engine.

00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:28.930
If you go really
extreme with this,

00:11:28.930 --> 00:11:31.780
like you just taxi
around for half an hour

00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:34.720
with the mixture control at
full rich, in some engines

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:37.060
you may end up getting lead
fouling on the spark plugs.

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:44.740
If you're up cruising and
you lean it out too much

00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:47.170
then the engine's going
to get a little bit rough,

00:11:47.170 --> 00:11:50.170
and some of the temperatures
will go too high.

00:11:50.170 --> 00:11:53.860
On the modern aircraft, you
have very sophisticated engine

00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:57.345
monitors that tell you all
kinds of information about what

00:11:57.345 --> 00:11:58.220
the temperatures are.

00:11:58.220 --> 00:12:02.530
They may help you lean
to the optimum mixture.

00:12:02.530 --> 00:12:05.905
If you have an autopilot,
it's kind of a good way

00:12:05.905 --> 00:12:08.155
to invest some of your time
once you're in the cruise.

00:12:11.050 --> 00:12:13.630
Carburetors, how do they work?

00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:17.290
If you fly a Piper or a Cessna
you can say that you have

00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:20.940
a jet-powered aircraft
because there is a jet

00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:25.590
in the carburetor that's letting
the low-pressure air and this

00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:31.062
venturi pull little bits of
fuel vapor out into the--

00:12:31.062 --> 00:12:33.270
well, I guess that throttle
looks pretty well closed,

00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:36.150
but ideally the throttle
would be kind of open,

00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:41.638
and the air-fuel mixture would
be going into the cylinders.

00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:51.380
Carb icing, so remember,
lower pressure--

00:12:51.380 --> 00:12:54.800
as the pressure falls the
temperature will also fall.

00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:57.560
So even if it's not
below freezing outside

00:12:57.560 --> 00:13:01.040
it can become below freezing in
the middle of the carburetor,

00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:05.120
and, therefore, water vapor
that has been in the air

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:09.920
can turn into ice and
eventually block the airflow

00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:12.530
to the engine.

00:13:12.530 --> 00:13:14.300
So they tell you,
look, well, just

00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:16.010
detect that by loss of RPM.

00:13:16.010 --> 00:13:17.550
You know, you're flying along.

00:13:17.550 --> 00:13:19.622
You should be watching
the RPM gauge.

00:13:19.622 --> 00:13:21.080
So obviously, you
would notice this

00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:23.367
and take the correct
action, instead

00:13:23.367 --> 00:13:25.700
of having a machine that would
figure this out and do it

00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:27.580
for you.

00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:29.330
I guess one reason
they don't want to just

00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:31.310
have carb heat on
all the time is

00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:39.230
that it robs the engine of some
of its last 10 or 15 horsepower

00:13:39.230 --> 00:13:40.100
or whatever.

00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:44.030
So the carb heat because
it makes the air hotter,

00:13:44.030 --> 00:13:48.020
it's just like going
up to a higher altitude

00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:49.442
or flying on a hotter day.

00:13:49.442 --> 00:13:51.650
The air is going to be
thinner, and, therefore, there

00:13:51.650 --> 00:13:54.557
are fewer molecules
of air to combust,

00:13:54.557 --> 00:13:55.890
and you won't get as much power.

00:13:55.890 --> 00:13:56.390
Question.

00:13:56.390 --> 00:13:59.802
AUDIENCE: What generates
the carb heat of the engine?

00:13:59.802 --> 00:14:01.760
PHILIP GREENSPUN: What
generates the carb heat?

00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:02.752
That's a good question.

00:14:02.752 --> 00:14:04.460
Same thing that
generates the cabin heat.

00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:07.685
You basically run the air
over the exhaust system

00:14:07.685 --> 00:14:09.560
before it goes to the
carburetor or before it

00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:11.300
comes into the cabin.

00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:13.880
Good question.

00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:16.250
Yes, so I think 1950s
cars had some kind

00:14:16.250 --> 00:14:18.010
of automatic
mechanism for this--

00:14:18.010 --> 00:14:22.320
it was, you know, buy a metal
valve, and I don't know.

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:25.070
The mixture control hasn't
been seen in automobiles

00:14:25.070 --> 00:14:26.480
for quite a long time.

00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:28.430
The ignition systems
of aircraft is actually

00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:29.900
pretty well designed.

00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:32.330
You have magnetos.

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:35.540
You can see them here and here.

00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:37.200
You can see him
here at the bottom.

00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:40.310
The left and right magnetos
are geared into the engine,

00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:44.690
and they generate
their own voltage.

00:14:44.690 --> 00:14:47.780
So basically, you don't need
to have a working battery

00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:52.430
or working alternator to have a
running engine unlike in a car.

00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:54.290
All you need is these.

00:14:54.290 --> 00:14:58.110
One of the magnetos is still
connected and working properly.

00:14:58.110 --> 00:14:59.720
So it's totally
separate from what

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:04.640
you might think of as the
aircraft's electrical system.

00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:08.780
And for further
redundancy, each magneto

00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:12.380
is connected to half
of the spark plugs

00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:15.530
such that if you lose
a magneto, you still

00:15:15.530 --> 00:15:20.450
have one working spark
plug in each cylinder.

00:15:20.450 --> 00:15:22.140
Does that make sense?

00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:24.740
You can see that in
this drawing here where

00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:26.780
each cylinder is being
fed either from the green

00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:30.110
or the blue magneto to one
of the two spark plugs.

00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:32.270
And you can test to
see if it runs smoothly

00:15:32.270 --> 00:15:34.330
on either magneto.

00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:36.050
Your ignition switch
on the airplane

00:15:36.050 --> 00:15:39.890
will have a right mag only
switch, a left mag only switch,

00:15:39.890 --> 00:15:42.830
or both mags, which is where
you have normal operation.

00:15:42.830 --> 00:15:44.810
But when you're
testing on the ground

00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:48.560
you'll typically see if it
works on either magneto.

00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:51.710
OK, abnormal combustion,
what can you get?

00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:59.680
You can get detonation
which is the mixture ignites

00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:05.200
before the spark ignites.

00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:11.870
Or pre-ignition, which is the
slow burn before the spark.

00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:14.980
And detonation I
think is probably

00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:17.240
the one that's more common.

00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:21.650
And it could be caused
by improper leaning.

00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:28.658
Aviation fuel,
basically 100 low led

00:16:28.658 --> 00:16:30.450
which is dyed blue is
all that you're going

00:16:30.450 --> 00:16:34.960
to see in the continental US.

00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:37.150
In the future though--

00:16:37.150 --> 00:16:39.730
so low that means it's
lower in less than the stuff

00:16:39.730 --> 00:16:43.670
that they were making in
the 1930s or whatever.

00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:44.920
It's still pretty high in led.

00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:46.870
It's like the super--

00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:48.520
it's like the premium
leaded gasoline,

00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:51.560
I think, of the 1970s.

00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:54.070
Most engines actually
don't require this.

00:16:54.070 --> 00:16:58.210
It's just that it takes so
long to get anything done

00:16:58.210 --> 00:17:01.990
in aviation that they can't put
an alternative certify and get

00:17:01.990 --> 00:17:05.170
an alternative fuel
to the airports.

00:17:05.170 --> 00:17:09.130
But, you know, your typical
Cessna or your Robinson R44

00:17:09.130 --> 00:17:11.740
with the carburetor,
it doesn't need

00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:14.950
this lead that's in
the fuel and then

00:17:14.950 --> 00:17:17.359
gets spewed out
in the atmosphere.

00:17:17.359 --> 00:17:18.740
It's kind of a tragedy.

00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:21.490
And it's been made worse
by this ethanol stuff.

00:17:21.490 --> 00:17:24.760
So the government says you have
to put ethanol in car gasoline.

00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:27.700
So you can't just go
and take premium car gas

00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:30.520
from the gas station and
pour it into your aircraft

00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:31.970
from a technical point of view--

00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:34.300
even if it were legal
regulatory-wise--

00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:37.390
because the ethanol will
destroy a lot of the fuel system

00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:39.740
in the aircraft which
wasn't engineered for it.

00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:41.960
But if you did
have ethanol-free--

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:44.020
there are a few places
that have mogas.

00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:46.690
They get special
ethanol-free car gas,

00:17:46.690 --> 00:17:49.930
and lower-performance
aircraft engines

00:17:49.930 --> 00:17:51.520
will run just fine on them.

00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:53.220
There have been
committees-- you know

00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:55.840
20 years is kind of like
the standard unit of time

00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:56.530
in aviation.

00:17:56.530 --> 00:17:58.360
So for about 20
years, people have

00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:01.420
been working on some kind of
certified unleaded gasoline

00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:03.610
that will work
with most engines.

00:18:03.610 --> 00:18:08.290
If you see clear
fuel in the sump,

00:18:08.290 --> 00:18:10.870
it usually means the airplane's
been left out in the rain,

00:18:10.870 --> 00:18:12.820
and some water has
gotten in there.

00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:15.340
And you got to make sure
that you drain that out.

00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:19.040
So there's drain plugs on the
bottom of the wings typically,

00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:21.620
and maybe one near the
bottom of the engine

00:18:21.620 --> 00:18:23.020
that you can see
if any water has

00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:24.910
gotten into the fuel system.

00:18:24.910 --> 00:18:29.890
Jet fuel is hazardous
to piston engines.

00:18:29.890 --> 00:18:31.960
The nozzles are
designed so that they're

00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:33.410
physically incompatible.

00:18:33.410 --> 00:18:36.700
You shouldn't be able to put
jet fuel into a piston engine.

00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:38.308
Occasionally it does happen.

00:18:38.308 --> 00:18:39.850
I know a guy who
was flying his Piper

00:18:39.850 --> 00:18:42.190
Malibu all around
the world, and he

00:18:42.190 --> 00:18:45.940
got some barrels of
fuel delivered to him,

00:18:45.940 --> 00:18:47.350
and he had to pump it himself.

00:18:47.350 --> 00:18:49.963
And I don't know,
for whatever reason,

00:18:49.963 --> 00:18:51.130
there was jet fuel in there.

00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:52.621
AUDIENCE: So Philip,
you might want

00:18:52.621 --> 00:18:53.840
to kind of stop [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:55.340
PHILIP GREENSPUN:
Is the pizza here?

00:18:55.340 --> 00:18:57.132
AUDIENCE: No, not
yet, but it's noon.

00:18:57.132 --> 00:18:59.507
PHILIP GREENSPUN: Yeah, well,
whenever the pizza is here.

00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:06.070
I think we're-- yeah, we'll take
a break as soon as the pizza

00:19:06.070 --> 00:19:07.180
shows up.

00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:10.840
All right, fixed-pitch
propellers.

00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:15.700
So your most basic trainer
has a regular propeller

00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:21.220
that its angle relative
to the hub never changes.

00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:24.310
There's also in
higher-performance aircraft,

00:19:24.310 --> 00:19:28.810
constant-speed propellers where
there's an adjustment mechanism

00:19:28.810 --> 00:19:30.460
that you can read about--

00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:33.880
a mechanical
collection of springs

00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:36.070
and spinning weights
that will try

00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:39.940
to keep the propeller
at 1RPM, and that

00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:42.910
can be a lot more efficient
in different phases of flight.

00:19:42.910 --> 00:19:44.890
You can see from
this that if you

00:19:44.890 --> 00:19:48.190
have a constant-speed
propeller, the efficiency

00:19:48.190 --> 00:19:51.910
across a huge range of
speeds is roughly constant,

00:19:51.910 --> 00:19:56.080
whereas if you have a
climb prop or a cruise

00:19:56.080 --> 00:20:02.680
prop it's only working
optimally at certain airspeeds.

00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:05.860
All right, so if you have
a constant-speed propeller

00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:07.750
you're now going to
have free power levers.

00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:10.210
That's the business end of
it and from a pilot's point

00:20:10.210 --> 00:20:10.960
of view.

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:14.500
You'll have throttle
which is the black one

00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:22.800
on the left, the blue
prop-speed control, and then

00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:24.870
the red mixture.

00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:27.210
The FAA, they may
ask you about this.

00:20:27.210 --> 00:20:28.680
You know they have
this doctrine.

00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:30.180
It's not really
true of all engines,

00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:33.330
but the idea is that you don't
want like a high power setting

00:20:33.330 --> 00:20:35.270
and a really low RPM setting.

00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:37.680
They claim that that's
making the propeller take

00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:41.250
such big bites of the air to
keep the low speed that it's

00:20:41.250 --> 00:20:43.770
somehow stressing the engine.

00:20:43.770 --> 00:20:47.580
But, again, not every engine
manufacturer agrees with that.

00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:49.380
All right, let's talk about--

00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:51.400
we'll start in on
flight instruments

00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:54.000
until our pizza arrives.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:59.370
So this is going to be
your reality I would say.

00:20:59.370 --> 00:21:05.310
Some of the test stuff concerns
the steam gauges of the past

00:21:05.310 --> 00:21:06.960
that you still see
at flight schools.

00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:11.175
And that there are some things
that we can learn from this

00:21:11.175 --> 00:21:12.300
though that we'll get into.

00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:14.040
There are some advantages.

00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:16.410
But anyway, let's start
with this six-pack

00:21:16.410 --> 00:21:18.900
because actually,
the electronic stuff

00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:21.000
is mostly trying
to replicate what

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:24.015
was done during World War II.

00:21:24.015 --> 00:21:25.890
There's very little in
a modern aircraft that

00:21:25.890 --> 00:21:28.710
isn't some kind of upgraded
version of what was in a Boeing

00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:33.520
B29 bomber, so it's worth kind
of knowing where it came from.

00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:34.690
So you've got your six-pack.

00:21:34.690 --> 00:21:37.890
You've got your
airspeed indicator.

00:21:37.890 --> 00:21:40.200
On the top left, you've
got your attitude indicator

00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:42.300
or artificial horizon.

00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:45.150
You've got your altimeter
on the top right,

00:21:45.150 --> 00:21:46.800
vertical speed
coming down around

00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:50.190
to the lower right, which tells
you how fast you're going up

00:21:50.190 --> 00:21:55.170
or how fast you're going
down, a directional gyro which

00:21:55.170 --> 00:21:58.350
is like a stabilized
compass showing you

00:21:58.350 --> 00:22:01.750
where you're pointed assuming
it's been adjusted properly.

00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:04.230
It has to be reset to
the compass in flight

00:22:04.230 --> 00:22:05.316
every now and then.

00:22:05.316 --> 00:22:07.542
Ah-ha, is our pizza here?

00:22:07.542 --> 00:22:08.750
AUDIENCE: I wish I had pizza.

00:22:08.750 --> 00:22:09.480
PHILIP GREENSPUN:
You didn't see any?

00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:10.170
AUDIENCE: No.

00:22:10.170 --> 00:22:11.212
PHILIP GREENSPUN: Oh, no.

00:22:13.530 --> 00:22:20.460
OK, and then you have
a turn coordinator

00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:22.890
which is another backup
gyro that tells you

00:22:22.890 --> 00:22:27.090
whether you're turning
left or right and also

00:22:27.090 --> 00:22:27.810
the coordination.

00:22:27.810 --> 00:22:28.470
That's just a ball.

00:22:28.470 --> 00:22:30.012
We'll get into that
in a little bit--

00:22:30.012 --> 00:22:35.010
about whether the airplane
is kind of pitched--

00:22:35.010 --> 00:22:37.500
improperly yawed.

00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:41.480
All right, so it says electric.

00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:43.818
For a gyroscope to keep
spinning that means

00:22:43.818 --> 00:22:45.110
it's being powered by electric.

00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:46.485
What else could
it be powered by?

00:22:46.485 --> 00:22:47.875
Does anybody know?

00:22:47.875 --> 00:22:49.760
What else is there
besides electricity

00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:52.222
that can make this thing spin?

00:22:52.222 --> 00:22:53.014
AUDIENCE: A vacuum.

00:22:53.014 --> 00:22:54.389
PHILIP GREENSPUN:
Yeah, a vacuum.

00:22:54.389 --> 00:22:56.320
So in the old days--
you know, again, this

00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:58.903
is not as common-- you'd have a
vacuum pump on the engine that

00:22:58.903 --> 00:23:05.980
would generate a force to
keep these gyros spinning.

00:23:05.980 --> 00:23:08.893
And those were often failing
which had some pretty bad--

00:23:08.893 --> 00:23:10.643
AUDIENCE: So these are
the current reality

00:23:10.643 --> 00:23:12.190
of many of our planes?

00:23:12.190 --> 00:23:13.600
PHILIP GREENSPUN: I don't know
of how many-- yeah, I guess

00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:14.813
there's a few Piper Warriors.

00:23:14.813 --> 00:23:17.230
Yeah, that's a good reason not
to take like the most basic

00:23:17.230 --> 00:23:18.272
airplane into the clouds.

00:23:18.272 --> 00:23:21.883
Because the idea is that you're
supposed to sort of notice.

00:23:21.883 --> 00:23:23.050
Do they have-- I don't know.

00:23:23.050 --> 00:23:24.760
I guess some of them have
a little warning light when

00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:25.960
the vacuum pump fails.

00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:29.380
But in the most
classic situation,

00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:32.410
you're supposed to notice
as the pilot in the clouds

00:23:32.410 --> 00:23:34.300
that this artificial
horizon is failing

00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:37.430
and it's inconsistent
with this instrument.

00:23:37.430 --> 00:23:40.180
And then you decide which
of the two to believe.

00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:42.910
Generally, it's this one
because it's more viable.

00:23:42.910 --> 00:23:44.950
And then you continue
your flight to the cloud

00:23:44.950 --> 00:23:47.030
without the artificial horizon.

00:23:47.030 --> 00:23:49.420
Anyway, that's
ridiculous obviously.

00:23:49.420 --> 00:23:52.900
So, you know the real
IFR airplanes these days

00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:57.420
have two attitude indicators,
both powered by electric.

00:23:57.420 --> 00:23:59.920
And you don't have to sort of
notice the subtle sign of them

00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:00.700
failing.

00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:03.670
There's just a big flag that
pops up when they fail--

00:24:03.670 --> 00:24:06.445
you know, if they lose power
for some reason, for example.

00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:12.100
All right, the
pitot-static system.

00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:15.460
So how do you know anything
about your airspeed?

00:24:15.460 --> 00:24:18.780
There's a tube somewhere on the
airplane usually hanging out

00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:22.420
under the wing in your typical
trainer or next to the nose.

00:24:22.420 --> 00:24:27.090
You see them on jets where
the ram air comes in,

00:24:27.090 --> 00:24:30.290
and the more ram air
pressure there is, then

00:24:30.290 --> 00:24:32.070
the faster you're going.

00:24:32.070 --> 00:24:36.470
That can be compared to
the static pressure which

00:24:36.470 --> 00:24:39.413
comes in from a
static port usually

00:24:39.413 --> 00:24:40.580
on the side of the airplane.

00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:43.130
It has to be in some
part of the airplane

00:24:43.130 --> 00:24:48.050
where the airflow is
suitable for a static port.

00:24:48.050 --> 00:24:51.510
So the ram air feeds only
the airspeed indicator,

00:24:51.510 --> 00:24:54.800
and the static source
has to feed the altimeter

00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:56.720
and the vertical speed.

00:24:56.720 --> 00:24:58.160
You've got to read this book.

00:24:58.160 --> 00:24:59.827
There's a couple of
questions about what

00:24:59.827 --> 00:25:02.450
happens if the pitot
tube gets clogged

00:25:02.450 --> 00:25:05.140
or if the static port is
blocked and taped over,

00:25:05.140 --> 00:25:07.830
and that makes the
instruments read inaccurately.

00:25:07.830 --> 00:25:10.980
So I'd read about
that for the test.

00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:12.720
OK, airspeed
indicator, here's what

00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:16.980
I was talking about how in some
ways the old stuff is better.

00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:22.505
So, look, here's a good example
of how you get more information

00:25:22.505 --> 00:25:23.880
out of this than
out of the speed

00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:25.130
tape on the modern instrument.

00:25:25.130 --> 00:25:27.880
This gives you all of the
aircraft's performance

00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:28.380
basically.

00:25:28.380 --> 00:25:31.230
You don't really need
to refer to the manual

00:25:31.230 --> 00:25:33.420
to see a lot of
important information.

00:25:33.420 --> 00:25:37.470
Well, don't fly-- you know, the
speed tape might only show you

00:25:37.470 --> 00:25:39.990
from here to here--

00:25:39.990 --> 00:25:44.530
from like 120 knots up
to 150 or something.

00:25:44.530 --> 00:25:46.710
But here you're seeing,
OK, let's not fly faster

00:25:46.710 --> 00:25:49.620
than about 208 knots.

00:25:49.620 --> 00:25:51.840
Unless we have the
flaps out, let's not

00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:54.930
fly slower than about 58 knots.

00:25:54.930 --> 00:25:58.500
And even with the
flaps hanging down,

00:25:58.500 --> 00:26:01.008
we don't want to fly
slower than 55 knots

00:26:01.008 --> 00:26:02.550
because that's going
to be where it's

00:26:02.550 --> 00:26:05.760
going to stall at
certain CG configurations

00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:07.110
and at gross weight.

00:26:07.110 --> 00:26:08.250
OK, the yellow arc.

00:26:08.250 --> 00:26:11.100
Well, the yellow
arc is to be avoided

00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:13.380
unless the air is smooth.

00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:16.410
So that was actually a
great user interface.

00:26:16.410 --> 00:26:19.710
And because cool jets
have the speed tape

00:26:19.710 --> 00:26:23.677
when they make the glass
panels for little airplanes

00:26:23.677 --> 00:26:26.010
which really don't need that
kind of precision and speed

00:26:26.010 --> 00:26:28.350
control, they said,
well, let's just

00:26:28.350 --> 00:26:31.800
have this thing that
the jet pilots have.

00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:34.910
All right, how does the
airspeed indicator work?

00:26:34.910 --> 00:26:39.810
There's brass in there, so
it's a cool old-school Sherlock

00:26:39.810 --> 00:26:42.040
Holmes-style brass instrument.

00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:45.180
The ram air is coming in.

00:26:45.180 --> 00:26:49.410
There's a diaphragm that moves
some levers, and eventually

00:26:49.410 --> 00:26:51.370
the needle swings.

00:26:51.370 --> 00:26:54.555
Again, you know, you don't have
to design one for your test.

00:26:54.555 --> 00:26:57.000
You just have to
know that it's going

00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:58.140
to respond to the ram air.

00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:04.920
Some of these little
symbols are worth knowing.

00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:08.520
Probably Va is
the most important

00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:10.313
because it's on the
test, I believe,

00:27:10.313 --> 00:27:11.730
as something that
is not indicated

00:27:11.730 --> 00:27:13.080
on the airspeed indicator.

00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:14.580
That's the maneuvering speed.

00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:19.110
That's the speed at which you
can do extreme control inputs

00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:20.610
and not bend the airplane.

00:27:20.610 --> 00:27:22.940
Any faster than
maneuvering speed

00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:25.830
it's possible that you
could yank the yoke back so

00:27:25.830 --> 00:27:29.790
hard that you'd bend the wings
a little bit or overstress them.

00:27:29.790 --> 00:27:32.460
The reason it's not indicated
on the airspeed indicator

00:27:32.460 --> 00:27:34.480
is it varies by weight.

00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:35.700
And it's actually higher--

00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:37.510
that's something
worth reading about--

00:27:37.510 --> 00:27:39.180
it's higher if the
airplane is heavier.

00:27:39.180 --> 00:27:43.260
It's one of the few speeds
where weight is helpful

00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:45.090
because if it's
really heavy, it's

00:27:45.090 --> 00:27:48.030
just harder to get the
airplane to perform

00:27:48.030 --> 00:27:52.050
in some extreme manner.

00:27:52.050 --> 00:27:53.750
VSO is also worth looking at.

00:27:53.750 --> 00:27:56.250
That's basically
the speed that's

00:27:56.250 --> 00:27:57.960
going to determine
how fast you land.

00:27:57.960 --> 00:28:00.000
That's the speed that
the airplane will

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:01.800
stall on landing configuration.

00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:03.700
So you usually want to
be going at least 20%

00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:08.080
faster than that to give
yourself a safety margin.

00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:10.360
OK, here's something from
the New England Air Museum

00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:12.510
in Bradley, Connecticut--
another great destination

00:28:12.510 --> 00:28:15.610
about half an hour's flight
away, huge airport, great FBO.

00:28:15.610 --> 00:28:18.240
They will give you a free car
to use while you're there.

00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:20.400
It's called Signature
Flight Support there.

00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:23.050
Anyway, so this aircraft--

00:28:23.050 --> 00:28:25.300
I think it's a P40
from World War II,

00:28:25.300 --> 00:28:29.230
and it can go up to
500 miles an hour.

00:28:29.230 --> 00:28:33.580
All right, altimeter,
this aircraft

00:28:33.580 --> 00:28:35.750
is at about 10,000 feet.

00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:41.370
So notice it has this
little triangular

00:28:41.370 --> 00:28:45.090
needle at 1 that's telling
you that it's at 10,000 feet.

00:28:45.090 --> 00:28:50.490
And then the longer needle
is reading in hundreds,

00:28:50.490 --> 00:28:53.190
so we're at about 10,200.

00:28:53.190 --> 00:28:55.470
And sure enough, we can
see this is indicating

00:28:55.470 --> 00:29:00.000
you know 10,180, so 3 needles.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.100
Usually, the ones you're
going to deal with

00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:08.840
are this one at the top
here for thousands of feet

00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:12.710
and this one for
hundreds of feet.

00:29:12.710 --> 00:29:15.070
OK, so back in the
old days before we

00:29:15.070 --> 00:29:20.020
decided to dig up all the coal
and the oil and set it on fire,

00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:21.730
this was our
standard atmosphere,

00:29:21.730 --> 00:29:23.200
and it was wonderful.

00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:26.020
And it was always 15
degrees at sea level.

00:29:26.020 --> 00:29:28.420
And it was always 29 or
niner two for pressure,

00:29:28.420 --> 00:29:30.980
but now we've ruined it.

00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:33.280
The standard
atmosphere is the basis

00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:37.060
for a huge number
of calculations.

00:29:37.060 --> 00:29:41.590
The altimeter, we're going
to look at this again.

00:29:41.590 --> 00:29:46.810
It has these android
wafers that, I guess,

00:29:46.810 --> 00:29:49.840
provide a reference pressure.

00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:52.570
And somehow the difference
between what's in there

00:29:52.570 --> 00:29:55.360
and what's coming in will
make the needles move.

00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:57.370
That's about as
much as I know not

00:29:57.370 --> 00:30:01.100
being a mechanical engineer.

00:30:01.100 --> 00:30:03.380
An important factor though
with all these altimeters

00:30:03.380 --> 00:30:06.770
is you can set it to correct
it for whatever the prevailing

00:30:06.770 --> 00:30:07.790
pressure is locally.

00:30:07.790 --> 00:30:09.915
So that's what you really
need to know as a pilot--

00:30:09.915 --> 00:30:11.930
that if they tell you
the altimeter setting

00:30:11.930 --> 00:30:19.410
is 3053, that you turn it until
you see 3053 in the window.

00:30:19.410 --> 00:30:21.620
It's worth knowing these
altitude definitions.

00:30:21.620 --> 00:30:26.000
The most important for
determining aircraft

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:28.460
performance is going
to be density altitude.

00:30:28.460 --> 00:30:31.250
That kind of tracks
the actual number

00:30:31.250 --> 00:30:35.570
of molecules that are in
a given volume of air.

00:30:35.570 --> 00:30:37.940
If you're flying
along, you'll be

00:30:37.940 --> 00:30:39.620
looking at indicated altitude.

00:30:39.620 --> 00:30:44.030
That's kind of how aircraft
tend to be separated.

00:30:44.030 --> 00:30:46.040
Everything else is
kind of nice to know.

00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:48.570
Pressure altitude, we
talk about it a lot,

00:30:48.570 --> 00:30:50.870
but I don't think
it's really often used

00:30:50.870 --> 00:30:53.312
in practice for much.

00:30:53.312 --> 00:30:54.770
Actually above it--
I shouldn't say

00:30:54.770 --> 00:30:58.040
that because above
18,000 feet it's used.

00:30:58.040 --> 00:31:02.222
You always set the
altimeter to flight level--

00:31:02.222 --> 00:31:06.735
you know, 220 instead
of 22,000 feet.

00:31:06.735 --> 00:31:09.110
If the temperature standard
pressure altitude and density

00:31:09.110 --> 00:31:11.580
altitude are going
to be the same--

00:31:11.580 --> 00:31:14.360
so that would be, again, 15
degrees at sea level and cooler

00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:14.990
as you go up--

00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:21.850
the pressure altitude will
also equal the true altitude.

00:31:21.850 --> 00:31:24.480
So that's the actual
height above sea level,

00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:26.710
again, in standard
atmospheric conditions.

00:31:26.710 --> 00:31:29.560
We'll talk about this at
a few times in this class.

00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:33.270
But when it's hot the entire
Earth's atmosphere expands,

00:31:33.270 --> 00:31:36.630
and if we were to cool the
earth down near absolute zero,

00:31:36.630 --> 00:31:38.700
the atmosphere would contract.

00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:41.880
We might read on our altimeter
that we were at 18,000 feet

00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:43.770
when we were only,
you know, an inch

00:31:43.770 --> 00:31:47.250
above the ground because the
Earth's atmosphere had shrunk

00:31:47.250 --> 00:31:50.820
to only two inches in size.

00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:56.820
All right, when you're flying
indicated altitude there's

00:31:56.820 --> 00:32:00.030
an expression called "high
to low, look out below."

00:32:00.030 --> 00:32:02.160
Because if you go
from an area where

00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:05.580
there's a high-pressure setting
to an area where there's

00:32:05.580 --> 00:32:08.730
a low-pressure setting,
you'll inadvertently

00:32:08.730 --> 00:32:11.520
descend by 1,000
feet if you just

00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:16.350
follow what the altimeter is
telling you without resetting

00:32:16.350 --> 00:32:18.240
the altimeter.

00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:24.300
Same issue when you go from high
temperature to low temperature.

00:32:24.300 --> 00:32:26.740
So I just came back from
Jacksonville, Florida,

00:32:26.740 --> 00:32:29.680
in the Cirrus, so I went
from high temperature.

00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:32.460
And at an indicated
altitude of 3,500 feet,

00:32:32.460 --> 00:32:36.210
I was actually a bit higher
above the earth than here

00:32:36.210 --> 00:32:37.665
in cold New England.

00:32:37.665 --> 00:32:39.290
So that's another
thing to be aware of,

00:32:39.290 --> 00:32:41.040
and this becomes
important for instrument

00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:45.840
flying in very cold conditions
like up in the Canadian Arctic.

00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:48.990
If you fly indicated altitudes
when it's extremely cold,

00:32:48.990 --> 00:32:51.900
you'll be closer to the ground
than they budgeted for when

00:32:51.900 --> 00:32:54.330
they designed the procedure.

00:32:54.330 --> 00:32:57.960
OK, vertical speed, if
you want to maintain

00:32:57.960 --> 00:33:00.630
500 feet per minute
climb rate or descent

00:33:00.630 --> 00:33:02.770
rate for your
passenger's comfort,

00:33:02.770 --> 00:33:05.700
then this instrument
is your friend.

00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:10.260
It does lag so you can't
really use this to--

00:33:10.260 --> 00:33:12.420
all these instruments
are outputs, not inputs.

00:33:12.420 --> 00:33:15.270
Your inputs as a pilot are
the attitude and the power.

00:33:15.270 --> 00:33:16.830
So you set a power.

00:33:16.830 --> 00:33:19.170
You set an attitude like
a little bit three degrees

00:33:19.170 --> 00:33:22.020
nose up, and then you
use these instruments

00:33:22.020 --> 00:33:25.210
to verify that you're getting
the performance that you want.

00:33:25.210 --> 00:33:27.540
Especially true for the
vertical-speed indicator

00:33:27.540 --> 00:33:30.210
because the instrument
itself has lag in addition

00:33:30.210 --> 00:33:34.130
to the lags that come from just
the inertia of the aircraft.

00:33:34.130 --> 00:33:40.050
OK, under the hood it's
gotten this calibrated leak.

00:33:40.050 --> 00:33:47.220
I don't really-- anyway,
it's another fancy instrument

00:33:47.220 --> 00:33:50.280
than a mechanical engineer
should tell you about.

00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:52.170
All right, gyroscopes,
the main property

00:33:52.170 --> 00:33:54.240
is you can use them for
an aircraft instrument

00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:59.640
because it will try to stay
where it is relative to space.

00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:01.440
It has to be corrected.

00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:05.460
In the instruments, it's really
where gyroscopic precession has

00:34:05.460 --> 00:34:07.260
to be considered
because think about it,

00:34:07.260 --> 00:34:09.750
you're going to be showing
the pilot various things

00:34:09.750 --> 00:34:11.570
on the face of the instruments.

00:34:11.570 --> 00:34:14.820
So you want to sure
that the deflections

00:34:14.820 --> 00:34:18.090
correspond to what's happening
out there in the real world.

00:34:18.090 --> 00:34:22.710
Again, this is covered
in the Pilot's Handbook.

00:34:22.710 --> 00:34:28.380
This just tells you, again, if
you kick a gyro up at the top,

00:34:28.380 --> 00:34:32.909
instead of the axis of the
gyroscope rotating downward,

00:34:32.909 --> 00:34:35.100
it's actually going
to yaw to the left.

00:34:35.100 --> 00:34:39.050
That's gyroscopic precession.

00:34:39.050 --> 00:34:43.340
Turn coordinator, it
has a gyro to tell you

00:34:43.340 --> 00:34:46.670
that little airplane, if you're
doing a standard rate turn,

00:34:46.670 --> 00:34:52.909
it'll go to this point here.

00:34:52.909 --> 00:34:55.460
That's a two-minute
turn that'll take you

00:34:55.460 --> 00:34:57.199
two minutes to go 360 degrees.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:03.470
And it's a backup to a
vacuum-powered attitude

00:35:03.470 --> 00:35:04.670
indicator.

00:35:04.670 --> 00:35:07.430
It also has this completely
separate function

00:35:07.430 --> 00:35:09.080
of a little ball in--

00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:10.940
I think, it's in
kerosene actually--

00:35:10.940 --> 00:35:12.860
so it's a little ball in fluid.

00:35:12.860 --> 00:35:16.162
And in a perfectly
coordinated turn,

00:35:16.162 --> 00:35:17.870
you should actually
feel like you're just

00:35:17.870 --> 00:35:19.737
standing on the ground
at 1G, and the ball

00:35:19.737 --> 00:35:21.320
should stay right
there in the center.

00:35:25.610 --> 00:35:27.880
All right, turn
coordinator, it can tell you

00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:30.910
whether you're slipping,
skidding, or coordinated.

00:35:30.910 --> 00:35:32.680
So if you're
coordinated, as I said,

00:35:32.680 --> 00:35:37.010
it's just like sitting in
a chair and not moving.

00:35:37.010 --> 00:35:41.710
If you're slipping, if you have
any trouble visualizing this

00:35:41.710 --> 00:35:44.170
you can just reflect
on the fact that you

00:35:44.170 --> 00:35:46.910
have to step on the
ball to fix the problem.

00:35:46.910 --> 00:35:49.000
So here your airplane's
in a right turn,

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:51.610
and it's telling you you have
to step on the right rudder

00:35:51.610 --> 00:35:54.610
and bring the nose more
around to the right in order

00:35:54.610 --> 00:35:55.990
to be coordinated.

00:35:55.990 --> 00:35:58.090
So that is a slipping turn.

00:35:58.090 --> 00:36:00.310
So here's our airplane.

00:36:00.310 --> 00:36:04.000
We've banked the
wings, but we've

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.897
got the nose still
kind of pointed

00:36:06.897 --> 00:36:07.980
where we used to be going.

00:36:07.980 --> 00:36:09.438
So it's telling us
you need to kick

00:36:09.438 --> 00:36:12.950
a little bit of right rudder
and have a coordinated turn.

00:36:12.950 --> 00:36:14.040
Skidding is the other way.

00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:16.500
For some reason, we have too
much right rudder in there,

00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:19.650
and we need to back off of
it or hit some left rudder

00:36:19.650 --> 00:36:21.783
and bring it back.

00:36:21.783 --> 00:36:23.450
Again, this is
something, it'll become--

00:36:23.450 --> 00:36:25.783
you know, eventually you
develop a sort of a feel for it

00:36:25.783 --> 00:36:28.722
in the seat of your pants, and
you'll just do it naturally.

00:36:28.722 --> 00:36:30.180
And actually, modern
aircraft don't

00:36:30.180 --> 00:36:33.582
have a whole lot of,
what's called, adverse yaw,

00:36:33.582 --> 00:36:35.040
so if you try to
turn them, they're

00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:37.080
not really going to
get out of coordination

00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:39.910
to any large extent.

00:36:39.910 --> 00:36:41.612
All right, attitude indicator.

00:36:44.710 --> 00:36:47.740
If you're either in level
flight or on the ramp,

00:36:47.740 --> 00:36:50.140
this little airplane
pointer here in the middle--

00:36:50.140 --> 00:36:51.430
that little orange thing--

00:36:51.430 --> 00:36:54.220
is just something that you
can rotate up and down.

00:36:54.220 --> 00:36:56.080
It's basically just
a reminder for you

00:36:56.080 --> 00:36:58.990
of what attitude will
produce level flight.

00:36:58.990 --> 00:37:01.360
It might be a couple
degrees pitched up or down,

00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:05.240
but you just set it
to whatever it is.

00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:09.170
This is a gyro that's free
to move in two directions,

00:37:09.170 --> 00:37:14.930
and as it moves, it
moves this bank index,

00:37:14.930 --> 00:37:19.448
I guess, on the face of the gyro
is what they're calling it--

00:37:19.448 --> 00:37:20.990
or maybe that just
is the bank index.

00:37:20.990 --> 00:37:23.810
It's moving the whole
artificial horizon

00:37:23.810 --> 00:37:26.900
on the face of the gyro.

00:37:26.900 --> 00:37:29.930
So the important thing is
it's a gyro at 2 gimbals.

00:37:29.930 --> 00:37:32.550
In aerobatic airplanes, this
design doesn't work very well.

00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:35.120
It tends to get damaged by
all of the extreme maneuvers

00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:36.770
and g-forces.

00:37:36.770 --> 00:37:39.600
As a pilot, what do you
need to know about this?

00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:42.050
It's worth knowing
how to read it.

00:37:42.050 --> 00:37:45.100
In your flight training, you'll
do, so-called, steep turns

00:37:45.100 --> 00:37:47.240
where you'll bank to
a 45-degree angle.

00:37:47.240 --> 00:37:50.010
It's mostly a visual maneuver
where you look outside,

00:37:50.010 --> 00:37:52.700
but the attitude indicator
is a good reference, again,

00:37:52.700 --> 00:37:56.960
to see whether the picture that
you've got of a natural horizon

00:37:56.960 --> 00:37:59.810
actually does correspond
to a 45-degree bank.

00:37:59.810 --> 00:38:02.270
If you go up, I think if you
go beyond 60-degree banks,

00:38:02.270 --> 00:38:05.581
it's time for your aerobatic
airplane and your parachute.

00:38:10.010 --> 00:38:12.200
That pointer at
the top generally

00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:15.950
will be pointed up at the sky
however you're maneuvering.

00:38:15.950 --> 00:38:18.360
We'll see this in a moment here.

00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:24.758
So you can see, let's just
pick a level right turn.

00:38:24.758 --> 00:38:29.492
So over here, you say,
well, that thing at the top

00:38:29.492 --> 00:38:30.950
isn't really pointed
up at the sky.

00:38:30.950 --> 00:38:33.070
It's just pointed off to
the left but think about it.

00:38:33.070 --> 00:38:34.695
They're just showing
you the instrument

00:38:34.695 --> 00:38:36.460
as you would see
it in the cockpit.

00:38:36.460 --> 00:38:40.630
So because the airplanes
turn to the right,

00:38:40.630 --> 00:38:43.690
that top pointer would
actually correspond

00:38:43.690 --> 00:38:46.330
to straight up into the sky.

00:38:46.330 --> 00:38:48.850
But as you see, it's kind of
the same picture you would get.

00:38:48.850 --> 00:38:52.390
You're more or less not
pitched but you are banked.

00:38:52.390 --> 00:38:54.280
If you're going up
climbing right bank,

00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:56.590
you see you're just pitched
up a couple degrees.

00:38:56.590 --> 00:39:02.113
There's a little bit more
blue here versus here.

00:39:02.113 --> 00:39:03.530
As an instrument
pilot, you'll get

00:39:03.530 --> 00:39:06.860
very good at seeing small
differences-- just one or two

00:39:06.860 --> 00:39:10.157
degrees of bank or pitch here.

00:39:10.157 --> 00:39:11.990
We're about to go into
the magnetic compass,

00:39:11.990 --> 00:39:13.940
so let's take a
break here and we'll

00:39:13.940 --> 00:39:16.745
wrap this up after
everybody has their pizza.

00:39:16.745 --> 00:39:19.130
A few things to remember
about magnetic compasses,

00:39:19.130 --> 00:39:23.300
and then we're off to Oshkosh
which is going to be more fun.

00:39:23.300 --> 00:39:25.790
The most important thing
is that it only works

00:39:25.790 --> 00:39:27.260
when you're straight and level.

00:39:27.260 --> 00:39:29.360
And the fundamental
insight for this

00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:31.790
is the compass is
a horizontal thing.

00:39:31.790 --> 00:39:34.400
It's only designed
to move horizontally.

00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:37.040
So if you start tilting
it, tilting your aircraft,

00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:38.157
one big part of it--

00:39:38.157 --> 00:39:39.740
big part of the
problem is the compass

00:39:39.740 --> 00:39:44.000
tries to still point itself
towards the magnetic north

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:46.410
pole which will cause it
to rotate a little bit.

00:39:46.410 --> 00:39:48.530
It's a little bit
hard to explain

00:39:48.530 --> 00:39:50.540
without thinking about
it and reading about it

00:39:50.540 --> 00:39:52.070
in the Pilot's Handbook.

00:39:52.070 --> 00:39:55.310
But the takeaway is that
because it has inertia,

00:39:55.310 --> 00:39:57.050
and because it's
not really fully

00:39:57.050 --> 00:40:01.130
free to rotate to point
in three dimensions down

00:40:01.130 --> 00:40:04.580
to the north pole, you get
all these bizarre errors.

00:40:04.580 --> 00:40:08.750
Like if you turn away
from a heading of north,

00:40:08.750 --> 00:40:11.400
it'll initially show a turn
in the opposite direction.

00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:15.080
And if you accelerate because
of the inertia, it'll--

00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:18.840
let's see, accelerate
north, and yes.

00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:20.888
All right, we'll get
into that in a moment.

00:40:20.888 --> 00:40:21.930
Even I can't remember it.

00:40:21.930 --> 00:40:23.763
Just remember don't
look at it unless you're

00:40:23.763 --> 00:40:25.780
straight and level.

00:40:25.780 --> 00:40:29.250
The true magnetic-- I think
actually the north pole--

00:40:29.250 --> 00:40:31.590
the magnetic north
pole, I heard recently

00:40:31.590 --> 00:40:34.710
there was some kind of
significant movement.

00:40:34.710 --> 00:40:37.890
Anyway, it's moved
quite a bit since 1632

00:40:37.890 --> 00:40:40.080
as you see here on this chart.

00:40:45.210 --> 00:40:48.080
Because true north is not equal
to magnetic north, and the kind

00:40:48.080 --> 00:40:51.320
of primary source of direction
that you have in your aircraft

00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:54.530
is a magnetic source,
on the charts,

00:40:54.530 --> 00:40:58.250
you end up getting these
isogonic lines that tell you

00:40:58.250 --> 00:41:00.350
how much correction to apply.

00:41:00.350 --> 00:41:04.560
So here you can see
14 degrees west.

00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:08.580
That tells you-- because if east
is least, and west is best--

00:41:08.580 --> 00:41:11.370
if we want to fly
straight true north,

00:41:11.370 --> 00:41:15.630
we actually have to
steer zero plus 14.

00:41:15.630 --> 00:41:18.970
So zero is the true
north course, add 14.

00:41:18.970 --> 00:41:22.470
And if we see 14 on our
compass, or between 10 and 20

00:41:22.470 --> 00:41:26.670
on our compass, between 1 and 2
I guess it would be indicated,

00:41:26.670 --> 00:41:29.880
then we're heading true north.

00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:33.910
If you forget all of this
stuff that I'm telling you--

00:41:33.910 --> 00:41:37.150
which I hope you will because
this is a very tedious area--

00:41:37.150 --> 00:41:39.160
you can cheat.

00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:41.570
So look at this VOR.

00:41:41.570 --> 00:41:44.940
The VOR tells you this
is the Block Island VOR.

00:41:44.940 --> 00:41:46.590
This is another
great place to fly.

00:41:46.590 --> 00:41:47.780
So you land there.

00:41:47.780 --> 00:41:48.830
You walk to the beach.

00:41:48.830 --> 00:41:50.750
You skip out on the ferry ride.

00:41:50.750 --> 00:41:53.300
This is the best arguments
for general aviation aircraft

00:41:53.300 --> 00:41:56.213
are almost always
places that are islands,

00:41:56.213 --> 00:41:58.130
and you can't drive there
on your Honda Accord

00:41:58.130 --> 00:41:59.690
even if you wanted to.

00:41:59.690 --> 00:42:05.320
So but you see here, the zero
magnetic line is not aligned.

00:42:05.320 --> 00:42:06.720
The charge is in true north.

00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:08.273
So there is your true north.

00:42:08.273 --> 00:42:09.440
There is your zero magnetic.

00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:11.900
So you can just see
that the variation here

00:42:11.900 --> 00:42:13.210
is about 14 degrees.

00:42:13.210 --> 00:42:14.780
You wouldn't even
need-- and you can

00:42:14.780 --> 00:42:17.510
also that east is least,
west is best rule,

00:42:17.510 --> 00:42:20.570
you can rederive it just
by looking at any VOR.

00:42:20.570 --> 00:42:25.990
Except don't look
at a VOR in Florida

00:42:25.990 --> 00:42:29.200
because that's where
there is no variation.

00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:31.930
But almost any other VOR
you can look at and see

00:42:31.930 --> 00:42:34.090
what the new rule is.

00:42:34.090 --> 00:42:37.280
All right, magnetic deviation.

00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:40.240
If you have stuff
in the airplane,

00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:44.700
it will cause the compass to
be a little bit inaccurate.

00:42:44.700 --> 00:42:47.100
So they give you this
compass card here underneath,

00:42:47.100 --> 00:42:49.760
which will give you usually
one or two-degree changes

00:42:49.760 --> 00:42:56.400
at the most for how you would--

00:42:56.400 --> 00:42:59.760
you know, if you want to
fly north magnetic heading,

00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:03.720
you might actually steer,
I don't know, zero-point--

00:43:03.720 --> 00:43:07.272
steer a course of
one or two degrees.

00:43:07.272 --> 00:43:09.480
You know, if you bring stuff
into the aircraft that's

00:43:09.480 --> 00:43:13.080
heavy and metal or magnetic,
that can affect your compass.

00:43:13.080 --> 00:43:16.253
And actually, in an aircraft
with heated windshields,

00:43:16.253 --> 00:43:18.420
if you turn on the heated
windshield for anti-icing,

00:43:18.420 --> 00:43:20.310
and in jets, it's
kind of standard

00:43:20.310 --> 00:43:21.780
to fly with them
on all the time,

00:43:21.780 --> 00:43:23.010
the compass becomes useless.

00:43:23.010 --> 00:43:26.610
The heated windshields
throw it off by 90 degrees.

00:43:26.610 --> 00:43:29.030
All right, in the
lowest end airplane,

00:43:29.030 --> 00:43:31.060
they'll have a directional gyro.

00:43:31.060 --> 00:43:34.640
Because of all of those
compass errors, you as a pilot,

00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:37.780
will basically, just
every five or 10 minutes

00:43:37.780 --> 00:43:41.830
if it's a really old and bad
DG, or maybe every half hour

00:43:41.830 --> 00:43:44.950
if it's a decent new one, you'll
just look up at the compass

00:43:44.950 --> 00:43:47.350
when you're in level
unaccelerated flight,

00:43:47.350 --> 00:43:54.350
and you'll reset with this
knob here down at the bottom.

00:43:54.350 --> 00:43:58.220
You'll twist that to
align the directional gyro

00:43:58.220 --> 00:43:59.300
to the compass.

00:43:59.300 --> 00:44:03.020
So the compass is the authority,
but it's only an authority

00:44:03.020 --> 00:44:04.560
when you're straight and level.

00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:09.560
OK, under the hood, notice
that this, unlike the attitude

00:44:09.560 --> 00:44:13.460
indicator, this
only has one gimbal.

00:44:13.460 --> 00:44:16.250
And that's really the takeaway
for why the attitude indicators

00:44:16.250 --> 00:44:18.800
tend to break more often
than these other instruments

00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:20.780
because they have two
gimbals and they're just

00:44:20.780 --> 00:44:23.550
a little more fragile overall.

00:44:23.550 --> 00:44:26.760
Horizontal situation,
everything in flying,

00:44:26.760 --> 00:44:28.740
they've tried to make
it more idiot-proof,

00:44:28.740 --> 00:44:31.292
and the HSI is a great
example of something

00:44:31.292 --> 00:44:33.000
that was figured out,
I don't know, maybe

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:34.860
in the 50s or maybe earlier.

00:44:34.860 --> 00:44:40.380
They said, what if we just
take that DG and we put

00:44:40.380 --> 00:44:42.150
an indicator on here.

00:44:42.150 --> 00:44:46.800
This is showing we're trying to
go on a heading of about 010--

00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:47.720
just slightly north.

00:44:47.720 --> 00:44:50.160
That's this yellow pointer.

00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:54.180
We are actually going on
a heading of about 020.

00:44:54.180 --> 00:44:56.190
Maybe that's because
of a wind correction.

00:44:56.190 --> 00:44:58.080
There's a wind coming
from the right.

00:44:58.080 --> 00:45:00.150
And it also
integrates your line.

00:45:00.150 --> 00:45:04.430
See it shows you with this
course deviation indicator

00:45:04.430 --> 00:45:06.430
that you're slightly to
the right of the course.

00:45:06.430 --> 00:45:08.650
The course is a little
bit to your left.

00:45:08.650 --> 00:45:10.758
And actually, this
person, I think,

00:45:10.758 --> 00:45:12.800
this pilot is flying an
Instrument-Landing-System

00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:13.850
approach.

00:45:13.850 --> 00:45:17.810
This yellow trapezoid
there on the left

00:45:17.810 --> 00:45:19.528
and right is showing
you where you

00:45:19.528 --> 00:45:20.820
are relative to the glideslope.

00:45:20.820 --> 00:45:22.310
So you're right
on the glideslope.

00:45:22.310 --> 00:45:23.750
So basically, all
the information

00:45:23.750 --> 00:45:27.072
that you need for your flight
other than the attitude

00:45:27.072 --> 00:45:28.280
is on this single instrument.

00:45:28.280 --> 00:45:29.905
If you have everything
set up correctly

00:45:29.905 --> 00:45:32.000
the radios or the
GPS, you really

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:33.800
don't need to look
anywhere but here

00:45:33.800 --> 00:45:35.100
and at the attitude indicator.

00:45:35.100 --> 00:45:36.590
It's a pretty nice idea.

00:45:36.590 --> 00:45:40.380
And this is replicated in
all of the glass cockpits.

00:45:40.380 --> 00:45:42.680
All right, technically
advanced aircraft,

00:45:42.680 --> 00:45:48.240
here's a photograph of the
latest and greatest Cirrus SR22

00:45:48.240 --> 00:45:51.240
or 20 cockpit.

00:45:51.240 --> 00:45:54.970
You have two big screens.

00:45:54.970 --> 00:45:56.410
One's usually called the PFD--

00:45:56.410 --> 00:45:58.590
primary flight display--
one's the MFD--

00:45:58.590 --> 00:46:00.340
the multifunction
display-- that shows you

00:46:00.340 --> 00:46:04.030
maps and weather and traffic.

00:46:04.030 --> 00:46:10.000
This idea came from the big jets
from the 80s, I guess, and 90s.

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:13.810
It was adopted in
the Cirrus in 2003,

00:46:13.810 --> 00:46:17.110
pioneered with an
MIT spin called

00:46:17.110 --> 00:46:19.810
Avidyne which is
a local company.

00:46:19.810 --> 00:46:21.820
Garmin kind of took things over.

00:46:21.820 --> 00:46:26.150
And most of the aircraft
today come with Garmin.

00:46:26.150 --> 00:46:28.930
G1000 is a brand name
that you might have

00:46:28.930 --> 00:46:30.210
heard for a Garmin product.

00:46:30.210 --> 00:46:32.050
It's pretty popular.

00:46:32.050 --> 00:46:34.090
In some ways, people
with older aircraft

00:46:34.090 --> 00:46:35.830
are almost better off right now.

00:46:35.830 --> 00:46:38.530
There's this huge
stream of retrofit stuff

00:46:38.530 --> 00:46:42.670
that's very innovative, more
so than the comprehensive glass

00:46:42.670 --> 00:46:43.810
panels.

00:46:43.810 --> 00:46:47.860
And usually, for $30,000
or so an older plane

00:46:47.860 --> 00:46:51.300
can be brought up to
the modern standard.

00:46:51.300 --> 00:46:55.720
OK, what if things are
not going well at all?

00:46:55.720 --> 00:46:58.720
The ultralights tend to
come apart in flight.

00:46:58.720 --> 00:47:00.910
Certified airplanes
virtually never come apart.

00:47:00.910 --> 00:47:04.420
They're just so over-engineered
that wings don't fall off,

00:47:04.420 --> 00:47:07.150
struts don't fail.

00:47:07.150 --> 00:47:09.860
But the two brothers--

00:47:09.860 --> 00:47:12.873
the Klapmeier brothers,
from Wisconsin, I believe--

00:47:12.873 --> 00:47:14.290
although the company
they started,

00:47:14.290 --> 00:47:16.760
Cirrus, is in
Duluth, Minnesota--

00:47:16.760 --> 00:47:18.760
they say, look, this
parachute would give people

00:47:18.760 --> 00:47:21.220
a lot of comfort, and
there are some situations

00:47:21.220 --> 00:47:24.190
in which it could be useful
even in a certified airplane.

00:47:24.190 --> 00:47:26.020
So they added it in the Cirrus.

00:47:26.020 --> 00:47:28.750
And you pull it, and the rocket
chutes the parachute out,

00:47:28.750 --> 00:47:30.520
and you float down.

00:47:30.520 --> 00:47:32.890
It's becoming more
and more popular.

00:47:32.890 --> 00:47:38.110
I thought it was a
payload-hogging waste of money

00:47:38.110 --> 00:47:41.410
when I bought the
Cirrus in 2005.

00:47:41.410 --> 00:47:44.010
And now that the engine
has 2,000 hours on it,

00:47:44.010 --> 00:47:46.890
and I'm flying at night, I
think that's pretty good.

00:47:46.890 --> 00:47:49.030
That's a pretty good parachute.

00:47:49.030 --> 00:47:50.890
I don't even mind
the $15,000 that we

00:47:50.890 --> 00:47:56.940
paid to have it all repacked
at the 10-year point.

00:47:56.940 --> 00:48:04.422
All right, summary,
so piston engines,

00:48:04.422 --> 00:48:06.880
they're very fuel-efficient
compared to jets at these power

00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:08.260
settings.

00:48:08.260 --> 00:48:10.930
They have quirks
which sounds bad.

00:48:10.930 --> 00:48:13.690
You know, one cylinder
might be running rough,

00:48:13.690 --> 00:48:16.150
but it's better than
in a jet world where

00:48:16.150 --> 00:48:18.670
if things aren't perfect, the
engine just quits or explodes

00:48:18.670 --> 00:48:19.480
or something.

00:48:19.480 --> 00:48:23.650
So turbine engines seldom go
bad, but when they do go bad

00:48:23.650 --> 00:48:26.650
it's often with no warning.

00:48:26.650 --> 00:48:29.410
Here's your six-pack.

00:48:29.410 --> 00:48:31.300
The altimeter,
remember, is essentially

00:48:31.300 --> 00:48:33.130
measuring a percentage
of the atmosphere

00:48:33.130 --> 00:48:34.270
that you're above or below.

00:48:37.100 --> 00:48:40.430
Compass is full of errors except
when you're straight and level.

00:48:40.430 --> 00:48:42.438
And also the aircraft
manufacturers

00:48:42.438 --> 00:48:43.730
are really systems integrators.

00:48:43.730 --> 00:48:45.397
They're buying the
engine from somebody.

00:48:45.397 --> 00:48:47.660
They're buying these
instruments like the Garmin G100

00:48:47.660 --> 00:48:49.940
from somebody.

00:48:49.940 --> 00:48:52.160
Study pitot-static failures
and the compass areas.

00:48:52.160 --> 00:48:55.960
And they're on the exam,
and they're not intuitive.

00:48:55.960 --> 00:48:57.970
Questions.

00:48:57.970 --> 00:49:00.550
This is another picture from
that air museum in Bradley.

00:49:00.550 --> 00:49:02.093
They have one of the handful--

00:49:02.093 --> 00:49:03.760
it's not flying, I
don't think, but it's

00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:06.370
restored-- a Boeing B29 bomber.

00:49:06.370 --> 00:49:08.680
And if you want to know
why I get defriended

00:49:08.680 --> 00:49:13.330
all the time on Facebook,
I posted this picture

00:49:13.330 --> 00:49:18.670
of their turret computer, and I
said I found the original iPad

00:49:18.670 --> 00:49:20.250
in the museum.

00:49:20.250 --> 00:49:21.928
That was hashtag not funny.

00:49:21.928 --> 00:49:23.800
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:23.800 --> 00:49:26.050
All right, any questions or
should we go into Oshkosh?

00:49:26.050 --> 00:49:28.550
We can have questions.

00:49:28.550 --> 00:49:31.630
Don't ask about those
brass and neural things

00:49:31.630 --> 00:49:36.060
because I was a math undergrad
and EECS grad student.

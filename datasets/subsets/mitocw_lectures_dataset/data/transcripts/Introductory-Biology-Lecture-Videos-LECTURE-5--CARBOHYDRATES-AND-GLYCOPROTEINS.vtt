00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.920
[SOUND EFFECTS]

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.340
PROFESSOR: OK, I just want to
just highlight your attention

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:21.300
to things.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.460
Like every day, I get
that MIT news feed.

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.170
I get a couple of
other news feeds.

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.530
And I just thought this was
really sort of a striking image

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:33.060
and I think a great way to
convey science and engineering

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:37.300
is through sort of really
eye catching imagery.

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.190
This is a synapse, which
is where nerves contact

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.740
to other nerves or to the
neuromuscular junction

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:46.890
in order to trigger activity.

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.050
And this is a piece of research
out of the Cima-- whoops,

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.440
go back one-- whoops,
go back one more--

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.980
between the Cima
and Langer labs,

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.080
where they've designed
little tiny microchip probes.

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.670
They're about 10 microns big.

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.420
They can be planted in the
brain in different sites,

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.160
hopefully non-invasively.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.850
And they can report
on concentrations

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.530
of this neurotransmitter,
dopamine.

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.860
And the reason you might
want to be able to do that

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.560
is that there is a
dopamine deficit in a lot

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.400
of neurologic disorders.

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.540
So you would like to understand
what the deficits are

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.320
and pinpoint points of the
brain where there may be issues.

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:38.640
And in fact, they used it to
track Parkinson's disease.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.890
Because Parkinson's
disease, some

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.690
of the therapeutic approaches
involve deep brain stimulation.

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:47.220
But you can't
really tell if it's

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.710
working unless you
can measure something.

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.240
And the thing that
you could measure

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.840
would be the absolute levels
of this neurotransmitter,

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.540
dopamine, which, by the way, is
originated from the amino acid

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:01.980
tyrosine.

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:04.650
You could sort of spot
some of the parts of that.

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:07.410
That would be the carbon.

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:11.790
Becomes a c-- there's a
carboxylate and an amine.

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.110
Oh, I've drawn the alcohol.

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:15.560
This should be an NH2.

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.640
Sorry, I just added
this at last minute.

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.690
So dopamine actually though
originates from tyrosine.

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.390
So I just thought you would
be interested because when

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.720
I talk about the highlighting
things that are in the news,

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.710
I mean things like this where
we're all kind of interested.

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:32.340
It's cool.

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.620
It's relevant to what we do.

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.980
And it really
combines the efforts

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.180
of scientists and engineers
to make tools and methods

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.000
and invent methods
to make measurements

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.310
that are quantitative
enough to guide

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.010
the analysis of a disorder.

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.940
So I just want to wrap up a
little bit on the aspects.

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.440
I was showing you the energy
diagrams in the last class

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.720
and telling you how enzymes
affect the course of a reaction

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.480
by lowering the
energy of activation,

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.720
by stabilizing a transition
state or a high energy

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.370
intermediate state.

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.280
So the energy of
activation becomes

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.670
smaller in the
catalyzed reaction,

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.930
therefore faster than
any uncatalyzed reaction.

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.450
And I did not give you
this number last time.

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.890
Enzymes catalyze
reactions through about 10

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:29.730
to the 6, a million
10 to the 10-fold.

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.850
So these are dramatic
increases in rates

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:36.660
that are really physio-- we
depend on physiologically.

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.340
They ensure specificity.

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.500
And they're essential
in all systems.

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:47.040
And the way we discuss energetic
changes in reaction diagrams

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.170
is by looking at what's
known as the delta

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:52.140
G. It's the change
in free energy.

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:56.370
What I show you here is an
exergonic reaction, where

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.120
it is a negative delta G. I
didn't reinforce that point

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:01.530
enough last time.

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.980
The energy of the products
is lower than the energy

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:06.280
of the substrates.

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.900
So energy is given out at the
end of the transformation.

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.350
That means the reaction
is favorable with respect

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:16.649
to an equilibrium, a
thermodynamic parameter.

00:04:16.649 --> 00:04:18.750
And then it's the
enzyme that takes

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:23.800
care of the kinetic
aspects of the reaction.

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.630
So just to sort of
show you the correlate,

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:29.970
an endergonic reaction
would look like this,

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.250
where the delta G is positive.

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:35.380
The products are less stable
than the starting materials,

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:38.190
which would mean the
reaction is not favorable.

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:41.130
But it will still proceed in
the presence of a catalyst.

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:42.690
And in this next
small bit where we

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:46.110
talk about pathways
and different aspects

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:48.630
of metabolism, I'm
going to tell you

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:51.640
how we get around the
unfavorable equilibrium

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:52.140
problem.

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:55.860
Because that's obviously a big
predicament in biochemistry.

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:58.170
If reactions aren't
favorable, why

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:04.330
do they go far enough to be
useful to us in metabolism?

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:08.790
So that reaction would
have a positive delta G.

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:11.460
And then I also mentioned
these two terms.

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:15.590
Anabolic refers to the
endergonic reactions.

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:17.340
I don't know why you're
doing this to me--

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:19.170
the endergonic reactions.

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:23.730
And catabolic refers to
the exergonic reactions.

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:25.770
OK, then this last point--

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:28.020
I showed you this
slide last time.

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:30.360
But I think it was
important to think about,

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.460
why are enzymes so big?

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:36.840
And I want to give one example
of an additional genetic

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:41.250
mutation that causes a human
disorder, where I at least show

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:44.160
you how the mutations
are spread quite

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.950
a distance from
the reaction center

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:50.610
to show you that all of
that structure that you see

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:55.020
in an enzyme as it interacts
with a small substrate

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:57.270
is critical for catalysis.

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:00.640
So we see small
substrates in each case.

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:03.030
But we have this
very large enzyme,

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:07.890
which is many, many times its
size, all engaged in catalysis.

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:10.840
But what's the proof of that?

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:12.330
So why are enzymes so big?

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:15.780
So phenylketonuria
is a human disorder.

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:19.620
It's one of those
disorders that neonates,

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:22.070
brand newborns are tested for.

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:25.410
They are checked for
the genetic signal

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:27.450
that shows that the
protein will have

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:29.640
mutations in its structure.

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:34.080
And there are many mutations
associated with a defect

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:35.820
in this particular protein.

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:37.950
And the protein that
I'm talking about

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:40.560
is phenylalanine hydroxylase.

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:43.860
So the disorder is
related to defects

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:45.600
in phenylalanine hydroxylase.

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:47.370
Now what does that enzyme do?

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:51.510
It takes phenylalanine and
installs a hydroxyl group

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:54.300
opposite to where it's
attached to the amino acid.

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:57.540
So this is the hydrophobic
amino acid phenylalanine.

00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:00.360
And this is another one of
the hydrophobic amino acids

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:02.940
in a similar family
that's tyrosine.

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:07.080
And in fact, it's the precursor
to dopamine physiologically.

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:09.420
Now it turns out
there can always

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:11.470
be too much of a good thing.

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:13.920
So if you have too
much phenylalanine,

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:17.100
it has to be converted to
a different amino acid.

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:19.410
Because the build
up of phenylalanine

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:22.590
gets to a certain stage
where it is converted itself

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:25.260
to a toxic byproduct
that actually

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:29.260
causes severe mental
disorders and seizures.

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:33.870
So the body needs to monitor
the levels of phenylalanine.

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:36.900
And at a certain stage,
phenylalanine hydroxylase

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:38.760
will convert it to tyrosine.

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:41.100
So even though
phenylalanine is essential,

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:43.900
too much phenylalanine
is a bad thing.

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:48.630
So that enzyme is the one that
is associated with defects--

00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:49.940
with mutations.

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:53.690
The lower the activity of
the phenylalanine hydroxylase

00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:58.170
and end you up accumulating
phenylalanine too high.

00:07:58.170 --> 00:08:02.010
And so the PAH
regulates the clearance

00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:04.470
from the body converting
it to tyrosine.

00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:08.970
So why-- you know, I told you
I would give you some insight

00:08:08.970 --> 00:08:14.850
into how entire enzymes are in
fact critical for cat lysis.

00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:18.030
So what I'm showing you
on this a little movie is

00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:22.200
that the sites shown in magenta
all around this protein,

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:24.570
the active site would be
where this big ball is.

00:08:24.570 --> 00:08:27.480
It's actually cofactor iron.

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:30.900
But the sites that are involved
in the reduction of activity

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:34.710
of phenylalanine hydroxylase
are way out on the protein,

00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:36.120
out on its perimeters.

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:40.590
So this protein is
about 49 angstroms,

00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:43.450
4.9 nanometers across.

00:08:43.450 --> 00:08:46.380
But the sites that cause
a reduction in activity

00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:49.910
are a long way away,
10 angstroms longer,

00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:52.050
15 angstroms, 16.

00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:54.570
So it turns out that
enzymes as catalysts

00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:57.540
don't just use the local
environment right near where

00:08:57.540 --> 00:08:58.830
chemistry happens.

00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:03.630
The entire protein collaborates
to make the changes happen

00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:04.950
in catalysis.

00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:07.380
So enzymes are big,
because you're not just

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:10.080
using this inner shell
of functional groups

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:11.460
where the substrate binds.

00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:15.330
You're actually using a lot
of the dynamics of the enzyme

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:17.520
to promote catalysis.

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:21.000
And just this sort
of visual shows you

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.520
how far away things
can be where they

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:25.950
suppress the
activity of a protein

00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:27.690
and make it a poorer catalyst.

00:09:27.690 --> 00:09:29.460
OK.

00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:34.430
So as I said, this is
one of the disorders,

00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:37.860
the genetic mutations that
is tested for at birth.

00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:40.770
If you have one of
these set of mutations,

00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:44.700
you immediately have to
be put on a diet that's

00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:47.730
low in phenylalanine, so
you don't bombard your body

00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:53.550
with too much phenylalanine,
not allowing the phenylalanine

00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:54.900
to build up too much.

00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:57.480
But I don't know if
any of you have lately

00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:59.520
grabbed a can of
Coca-Cola that's

00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:02.070
got aspartame as a sweetener.

00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:05.580
It turns out that sweetener,
NutraSweet rather,

00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:07.810
is a dipeptide.

00:10:07.810 --> 00:10:08.580
See?

00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:10.800
But it contains phenylalanine.

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:15.600
So if you drink a ton of diet
drinks that include NutraSweet,

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:17.910
you are actually
bombing yourself

00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:20.440
with high levels
of phenylalanine

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:21.960
that the body can't deal with.

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:24.150
So people who have
phenylketonuria,

00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:28.440
i.e. a defect in that enzyme,
shouldn't be drinking or using

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:30.360
NutraSweet type sweeteners.

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:32.310
Because they actually
give you too much

00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:36.390
phenylalanine at once, that
you can mitigate the levels of.

00:10:36.390 --> 00:10:40.050
So I want to just tell you
about these genetic disorders.

00:10:40.050 --> 00:10:43.980
There's a fairly decent set
that are tested for at birth.

00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:46.080
But the ones that are
tested are for ones

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:49.140
that you can make dietary
modifications or lifestyle

00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:53.110
modifications and
mitigate the symptoms.

00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:56.190
And so that's a very
important thing to know.

00:10:56.190 --> 00:10:59.760
You're not tested for things
you don't know how to fix,

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:02.430
because that wouldn't
be appropriate.

00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:06.770
All right, any
questions about that?

00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:07.441
Yeah.

00:11:07.441 --> 00:11:10.312
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:10.312 --> 00:11:10.937
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:11:10.937 --> 00:11:12.340
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:14.890
PROFESSOR: Oh, you know, that
was me being clunky with--

00:11:14.890 --> 00:11:16.694
of course you guys
notice everything.

00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:21.133
This morning, I was making--

00:11:21.133 --> 00:11:22.300
all right, let's go forward.

00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:25.600
One, two, and that and that.

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:27.370
I know exactly what
you're talking about.

00:11:27.370 --> 00:11:30.100
This little curb
down, yeah that's

00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:33.520
me shaking when I'm doing
the ChemDraw drawing.

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:35.350
It should be flat.

00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:36.760
But thank you for noticing that.

00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:39.910
Just so that's not ambiguity,
there should not be-- there

00:11:39.910 --> 00:11:42.280
could be, actually, a little
dip when substrates bind

00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:42.850
to enzymes.

00:11:42.850 --> 00:11:44.630
But I didn't mean to imply it.

00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:45.730
OK, anything else?

00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:54.610
OK, so what I want to talk about
now is the equilibrium problem.

00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:55.580
And what is that?

00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:16.560
So if we have reactions
that are endergonic--

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:18.600
so we have one of
these situations

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:22.140
where we have a substrate
going to a product that's

00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:22.845
higher energy.

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:29.100
What that means is, at
equilibrium between substrate

00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:32.820
and product, which is
defined by the delta G,

00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:36.990
you have substrate
going to product.

00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:40.120
But mostly, you've
got a lot of substrate

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:42.010
there, which is
the amount of each

00:12:42.010 --> 00:12:44.890
of these is defined by
this energy difference.

00:12:44.890 --> 00:12:45.700
OK.

00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:49.310
So how do we survive with
these kinds of transformations

00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:52.780
when we really want
the flux for an enzyme

00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:55.780
to be in the forward direction?

00:12:55.780 --> 00:12:59.450
Because if we need the product,
we need to move things forward.

00:12:59.450 --> 00:13:02.680
So nature deals with this
by coupling reactions

00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:04.220
to other reactions.

00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:07.510
So it finds ways around
the equilibrium problem

00:13:07.510 --> 00:13:10.810
by, for example, putting
a series of reactions.

00:13:10.810 --> 00:13:16.330
For example, let's
go from A to B to C.

00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:21.940
So these are three intermediates
catalyzed by enzyme 1,

00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:23.210
enzyme 2.

00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:24.250
OK.

00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:28.360
And let's just say this
has an unfavorable delta G.

00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:35.910
So we don't make-- we have a
lot of A. We have very little B.

00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:37.440
And then what happens?

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:38.940
How are we going
to-- and then let's

00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:43.710
just say, for example,
this reaction is favorable.

00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:44.490
So let's see.

00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:47.950
The delta G here is positive.

00:13:47.950 --> 00:13:51.690
The delta G here is negative.

00:13:51.690 --> 00:13:55.030
So by plus VE, I mean
positive and negative.

00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:59.500
So this is a favorable
reaction, whereas this

00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:01.630
is an unfavorable reaction.

00:14:01.630 --> 00:14:04.990
How does putting two
reactions adjacent

00:14:04.990 --> 00:14:07.900
to each other happening
on the same substrate

00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:10.210
and moving through
help that situation?

00:14:12.830 --> 00:14:13.910
Yeah.

00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:18.658
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:18.658 --> 00:14:19.450
PROFESSOR: Perfect.

00:14:19.450 --> 00:14:24.490
So the answer here is that, as
you take whatever B you have

00:14:24.490 --> 00:14:28.140
and turn it into C, A has to--

00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:32.650
A1 has to make more B. So you
solve the equilibrium problem

00:14:32.650 --> 00:14:35.650
in that way to a certain
extent by just opening the tap

00:14:35.650 --> 00:14:37.430
at the other end of the series.

00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:40.750
And nature organizes a ton
of reactions in sequential

00:14:40.750 --> 00:14:44.570
pathways to get around
these kinds of problems.

00:14:44.570 --> 00:14:47.400
So this is done by
coupling reactions.

00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:55.720
And so there are
some reactions that

00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:59.380
are highly favorable,
highly exothermic,

00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:02.260
where you can really
sort of guarantee flux

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:03.580
through that enzyme.

00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:07.800
A lot of these enzymes
are ATP dependent.

00:15:10.890 --> 00:15:12.930
They use and burn ATP.

00:15:12.930 --> 00:15:14.850
So you get a lot of energy out.

00:15:14.850 --> 00:15:17.640
And they drive the flux
through enzyme one,

00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:20.890
by enzyme to being an
exergonic reaction,

00:15:20.890 --> 00:15:22.590
while the enzyme one
is and endergonic.

00:15:22.590 --> 00:15:24.240
So flux is guaranteed.

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:28.620
And a lot of pathways sort
of set up to be in this way

00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:31.200
with this coupling
of the chemistries.

00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:35.530
What else?

00:15:35.530 --> 00:15:43.590
So what we find is that
enzymes, first of all,

00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:50.890
work in pathways where they are
co-located in certain places.

00:15:50.890 --> 00:15:57.810
They may be, for
example, co-localized

00:15:57.810 --> 00:16:00.030
to certain organelles
in a human cell.

00:16:00.030 --> 00:16:03.090
They may be co-localized
in the mitochondria

00:16:03.090 --> 00:16:07.390
or in some organelle.

00:16:07.390 --> 00:16:10.260
And we'll talk more about
organelles and mitochondria

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:11.390
later.

00:16:11.390 --> 00:16:14.435
They could be co-localized
at a membrane.

00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:20.540
And so you ensure that
the enzymes are together

00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:22.640
by putting them
in the same place.

00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:25.520
And then nature
also evolves ways

00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:28.760
where the enzymes physically
interact with each other,

00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:31.670
either covalently
or non-covalently.

00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:35.720
So they could be
associated in the pathway

00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:39.320
by some kind of
non-covalent interaction.

00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:48.390
Or you may actually link enzymes
to make them single species.

00:16:48.390 --> 00:16:53.820
So if this is enzyme one
and this is enzyme two,

00:16:53.820 --> 00:17:00.840
here you have an enzyme
one, enzyme two single

00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:04.613
long polypeptide chain
that has two domains.

00:17:04.613 --> 00:17:06.780
They can't get away from
each other, because they're

00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:08.400
joined covalently.

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:10.619
And they catalyze
sequential reactions.

00:17:10.619 --> 00:17:13.410
This just doesn't happen
with just three enzymes.

00:17:13.410 --> 00:17:15.869
It can happen with
10 enzymes or more.

00:17:15.869 --> 00:17:18.990
So there are very clever
ways to ensure the flux

00:17:18.990 --> 00:17:21.990
occurs through pathways.

00:17:21.990 --> 00:17:22.490
OK.

00:17:26.609 --> 00:17:30.210
But don't forget, all along,
that each of these enzymes

00:17:30.210 --> 00:17:32.730
is responsible for a
single transformation.

00:17:32.730 --> 00:17:34.080
That's important.

00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:37.470
There's another phenomenon that
having flux through pathways

00:17:37.470 --> 00:17:44.130
is very useful for, is to
deal with toxic intermediates.

00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:52.390
Because that makes
it very advantageous,

00:17:52.390 --> 00:17:54.920
again, to couple reactions.

00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:59.205
So let's say product B is toxic.

00:18:02.230 --> 00:18:04.100
We don't want it
hanging around much.

00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:07.500
We don't want it released
from an enzyme to go do damage

00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:09.160
somewhere in the cell.

00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:11.760
So having flux through
a pathway basically

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:14.160
ensures the B never
gets out of the game.

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:16.500
It just goes straight
to enzyme two.

00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:20.250
So that's another physical
advantage of those processes

00:18:20.250 --> 00:18:22.290
being linked together.

00:18:22.290 --> 00:18:28.050
And finally, the process also
ensures a very nice opportunity

00:18:28.050 --> 00:18:29.760
to do regulation.

00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:32.490
So here we on this
slide, I show you

00:18:32.490 --> 00:18:35.700
this sort of mega mess
of metabolic pathways

00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:36.450
in physiology.

00:18:36.450 --> 00:18:39.090
That there would
be the Krebs cycle.

00:18:39.090 --> 00:18:42.570
But all the metabolic pathways
that are all interlinked.

00:18:42.570 --> 00:18:45.720
And many of these pathways
will be co-locali--

00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:49.800
steps in these pathways will
be co-localized as clusters.

00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:55.050
And so that deal tells you how
we can solve the equilibrium

00:18:55.050 --> 00:18:57.510
problem by linking enzymes--

00:18:57.510 --> 00:18:59.400
the flux through pathways.

00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:03.240
And one of the best examples
is in aerobic glycolysis,

00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:04.890
where in the early
steps, they're

00:19:04.890 --> 00:19:07.110
not energetically favorable.

00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:11.220
You use ATP to start
to break down glucose.

00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:13.110
Then you get to a
certain intermediate

00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:16.530
where it's conversion
to a smaller molecule

00:19:16.530 --> 00:19:19.780
generates ATP with very
favorable reactions.

00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:24.360
So glycolysis is a really
great example of this.

00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:27.210
Now the other thing that I
just want to describe to you

00:19:27.210 --> 00:19:32.060
is the issue of feedback.

00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:36.920
And I've described this
here on this slide.

00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:39.010
And so we'll talk
about it on this slide.

00:19:39.010 --> 00:19:42.330
So if we are working
with a pathway

00:19:42.330 --> 00:19:47.340
that goes through multiple steps
to make an end product, five

00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:49.420
steps, three steps or whatever.

00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:50.990
And you've made
too much of that.

00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:52.740
You've already made a
lot of that product.

00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:54.690
And you don't need anymore.

00:19:54.690 --> 00:19:59.130
Nature also has in place
a regulatory mechanism

00:19:59.130 --> 00:20:02.310
to feedback and stop
flux through the pathway.

00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:04.350
You don't just stop
all the enzymes.

00:20:04.350 --> 00:20:07.510
You find a way to
stop the first enzyme.

00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:12.150
So this is a very important
paradigm in biochemistry.

00:20:12.150 --> 00:20:14.400
And that's called
negative feedback.

00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:17.910
So I'm showing you it here
just in a very simple cartoon

00:20:17.910 --> 00:20:21.630
form in the isoleucine
biosynthesis pathway.

00:20:21.630 --> 00:20:24.150
That's one of the
hydrophobic amino acids.

00:20:24.150 --> 00:20:27.120
This is an intermediate
that is on its way

00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:31.530
from this amino acid that
is polar but not charged,

00:20:31.530 --> 00:20:32.400
threonine.

00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:35.280
So threonine gets
converted to isoleucine.

00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:37.950
We need threonine
to make isoleucine.

00:20:37.950 --> 00:20:40.280
But once we got a
lot of isoleucine,

00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:45.510
it binds to the very first
enzyme in the pathway and acts

00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:49.860
as an allosteric regulator
that dampens activity.

00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:52.050
So in this case, I
just want to point out

00:20:52.050 --> 00:20:56.490
to you that I'm showing a very
common way we notate things.

00:20:56.490 --> 00:21:00.840
When we are talking about
inhibiting a reaction,

00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:02.160
we draw it like this.

00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:10.060
We align and then align
to the so the arrow,

00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:12.800
see which means you've
stopped the activity.

00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:14.750
So you'll see this
again and again.

00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:17.300
You're going to see it a
lot in signaling pathways,

00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:19.190
because things often feedback.

00:21:19.190 --> 00:21:22.640
So another thing that
nature ensures, in addition

00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:24.590
to not building
up toxic products

00:21:24.590 --> 00:21:26.720
and dealing with
equilibria, is that you

00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:29.360
don't want a ton of enzymes
working to make something

00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:30.920
you don't need anymore.

00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:33.470
So you might as well
take the end product

00:21:33.470 --> 00:21:35.870
and use it to stop
the first enzyme.

00:21:35.870 --> 00:21:38.940
As that in product
becomes scarce,

00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:40.910
it dissociates from
the first enzyme.

00:21:40.910 --> 00:21:43.170
And it turns the
pathway back on again.

00:21:43.170 --> 00:21:47.350
And I think that's a really
neat way of making that happen.

00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:49.640
And also, in these
cases, the enzymes

00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:51.200
have to be clustered as a group.

00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:54.080
Because you wouldn't get
those local concentrations

00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:57.790
to be so advantageous if the
enzymes weren't co-localized.

00:21:57.790 --> 00:21:59.600
So does that make sense?

00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:03.050
If they weren't in a really
near location, the enzyme that

00:22:03.050 --> 00:22:06.230
present produces
isoleucine, that isoleucine

00:22:06.230 --> 00:22:09.140
couldn't bind back to the
first enzyme in the pathway

00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:12.290
if they were in different
compartments of the cell.

00:22:12.290 --> 00:22:16.050
OK, everyone good with that?

00:22:16.050 --> 00:22:17.050
Good.

00:22:17.050 --> 00:22:19.080
All right.

00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:23.020
OK, so now we are moving
on to carbohydrates.

00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:44.490
It's a pretty strange
word, carbohydrate.

00:22:44.490 --> 00:22:47.360
But actually, it relates
to early findings

00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:51.300
that glucose is a carbohydrate.

00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:53.820
And its molecular
formula is C6H12O6.

00:22:56.850 --> 00:23:00.790
So they called it
a hydrate of carbon

00:23:00.790 --> 00:23:04.060
before when they knew the
elemental composition but they

00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:05.980
didn't know anything
about the structure.

00:23:05.980 --> 00:23:09.610
There's a lot of carbohydrates
that don't obey this rule.

00:23:09.610 --> 00:23:13.760
But that's where the name comes
from, a hydrate of carbon.

00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:17.170
All right now
carbohydrates account

00:23:17.170 --> 00:23:20.540
for-- what did I have here?

00:23:20.540 --> 00:23:25.970
25% of the mass of
macromolecules, so

00:23:25.970 --> 00:23:27.470
a good amount.

00:23:27.470 --> 00:23:30.170
They are very, very
important, carbohydrates

00:23:30.170 --> 00:23:31.700
in central metabolism.

00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:35.450
We use carbohydrates
as a source of energy.

00:23:35.450 --> 00:23:37.880
But also, carbohydrates
are a part

00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:42.320
of storage of energy in the
form of polymeric structures,

00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:43.770
that I'll describe to you.

00:23:43.770 --> 00:23:47.210
There are different ones
in plants and in humans.

00:23:47.210 --> 00:23:51.620
One is glycogen.
One is cellulose.

00:23:51.620 --> 00:23:55.280
But carbohydrates have an
increasingly important role

00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:58.580
in the extracellular matrix
in these polymers that

00:23:58.580 --> 00:24:02.990
are wrapped around your cells
and also as signaling entities

00:24:02.990 --> 00:24:05.460
both inside and
outside the cell.

00:24:05.460 --> 00:24:07.370
So we used to think
of carbohydrates

00:24:07.370 --> 00:24:10.190
and straight away connect
this with metabolism.

00:24:10.190 --> 00:24:12.710
But the story is far
greater than that.

00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:14.720
And I'll try to
explain to you why.

00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:17.180
And it's because of the
richness of functional groups

00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:18.830
in a carbohydrate.

00:24:18.830 --> 00:24:24.910
So the simplest carbohydrate,
before I go up there,

00:24:24.910 --> 00:24:27.280
is a three carbon molecule.

00:24:30.810 --> 00:24:33.840
This would actually be
called glyceraldehyde.

00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:36.220
But don't worry about
that other name for it.

00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:39.730
It's a three carbon
carbohydrate.

00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:50.120
And this molecule would
be called a triose.

00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:53.345
So we've got a couple
of new-- a new suffix.

00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:59.530
Because anything that
is a carbohydrate

00:24:59.530 --> 00:25:02.140
ends with the suffix
"ose," not to be

00:25:02.140 --> 00:25:05.840
confused with the suffix
"ase," which is an enzyme.

00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:08.310
So look carefully whether it's
an "a" or "o," because it's

00:25:08.310 --> 00:25:10.990
the difference between a
big protein that catalyzes

00:25:10.990 --> 00:25:13.270
a reaction and a carbohydrate.

00:25:13.270 --> 00:25:16.090
So a triose would
be a carbohydrate

00:25:16.090 --> 00:25:17.740
with three carbons.

00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:20.070
They have an aldehyde.

00:25:20.070 --> 00:25:23.020
Or let's just say they have
a carbonyl functionality.

00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:31.570
So remember, there would be lone
pair electrons on those OHs,

00:25:31.570 --> 00:25:33.490
similarly on these.

00:25:33.490 --> 00:25:36.700
And remember, that
each of these vertices

00:25:36.700 --> 00:25:39.660
corresponds to a carbon.

00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:44.620
It's some-- the way you
recognize carbohydrates is most

00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:45.910
commonly--

00:25:45.910 --> 00:25:53.020
is that they are rich
in carbon dash OH

00:25:53.020 --> 00:25:54.818
bonds, which are hydroxyls.

00:25:57.746 --> 00:26:00.610
Which makes them
polar molecules,

00:26:00.610 --> 00:26:04.630
likely to be highly solvated
in water and very different

00:26:04.630 --> 00:26:08.320
for from the compounds that
are rich in just CH bonds that

00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:10.460
don't have such opportunities.

00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:13.660
So if you see a molecule
and it's got a bunch of CHs

00:26:13.660 --> 00:26:16.440
but not a bunch of OHs,
it's probably a lipid.

00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:19.810
If you see a compound
that's rich in OHs,

00:26:19.810 --> 00:26:22.420
it's likely to be
a carbohydrate.

00:26:22.420 --> 00:26:24.790
The story gets a little
bit more interesting

00:26:24.790 --> 00:26:28.060
as we move up to some of the
different carbohydrates, which

00:26:28.060 --> 00:26:29.560
I've shown you there
on that screen.

00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:32.110
And I'm going to go forward
to talk about those.

00:26:32.110 --> 00:26:37.240
Because this triose is
important in primary metabolism.

00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:40.030
We break down
carbon carbohydrates

00:26:40.030 --> 00:26:44.740
that have six sugars to small
carbohydrates that have three--

00:26:44.740 --> 00:26:46.600
excuse me,
carbohydrates that have

00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:49.850
six carbons to carbohydrates
that have three carbons.

00:26:49.850 --> 00:26:52.990
And that's where these three
carbon entities crop up.

00:26:52.990 --> 00:26:58.810
But I want to focus you in
on two sets of carbohydrates,

00:26:58.810 --> 00:27:00.860
the hexoses and the pentoses.

00:27:04.750 --> 00:27:09.010
So we immediately know
they're carbohydrates, right?

00:27:09.010 --> 00:27:10.600
"Ose."

00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:15.110
The hexoses obviously
have six carbons.

00:27:15.110 --> 00:27:18.170
And the pentoses
have five carbons.

00:27:18.170 --> 00:27:21.050
And these are the most
important of the carbohydrates.

00:27:21.050 --> 00:27:23.810
Yes, there are carbohydrates
with four carbons.

00:27:23.810 --> 00:27:27.230
And then there were ones with
seven, eight, nine carbons.

00:27:27.230 --> 00:27:28.730
But these are the
ones will totally

00:27:28.730 --> 00:27:31.550
focus on in 7016,
because these are

00:27:31.550 --> 00:27:34.550
very important in
different biopolymers.

00:27:34.550 --> 00:27:39.220
And the hexoses are important
components, for example,

00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:50.570
of cellulose and glycogen. But
where are the pentose carbons?

00:27:50.570 --> 00:27:53.320
And why are they so important?

00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:55.962
Actually, I need to draw this
is its straight chain version.

00:27:55.962 --> 00:27:57.170
Because I'll drive you crazy.

00:28:07.580 --> 00:28:11.420
So this sugar here is a
pentose, one, two, three, four,

00:28:11.420 --> 00:28:15.890
five carbons, a bunch of
OHs, aldehyde at one end.

00:28:15.890 --> 00:28:20.002
Commonly, carbohydrates will
fold up into a cyclic structure

00:28:20.002 --> 00:28:20.960
through an equilibrium.

00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:23.660
I won't worry you too
much with the chemistry.

00:28:23.660 --> 00:28:28.240
But I'm just going to
show you that structure.

00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:30.600
It looks like this,
a five-membered ring.

00:28:33.370 --> 00:28:37.260
The interconversion of these
two is an equilibrium process.

00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:41.860
And those carbohydrates are
incredibly important where?

00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:44.930
Yeah, nucleic acids.

00:28:44.930 --> 00:28:48.880
So your phosphodiester
backbone is

00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:54.820
attached to sugars that are
attached a bit to purines

00:28:54.820 --> 00:28:55.510
and pyrimidines.

00:28:55.510 --> 00:28:57.520
And we'll see those
structures later.

00:28:57.520 --> 00:29:02.050
But an absolutely essential
feature of that polymer

00:29:02.050 --> 00:29:04.960
is the five-membered
ring carbohydrates

00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:11.770
that are known as ribose,
which is what that guy is,

00:29:11.770 --> 00:29:21.160
and two deoxyribose,
where one of the hydroxyls

00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:23.840
is actually a hydrogen.
It's not a hydroxyl.

00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:27.070
And it's this one.

00:29:27.070 --> 00:29:31.140
So instead of being
an OH, it's an H.

00:29:31.140 --> 00:29:32.700
And we number carbohydrates.

00:29:32.700 --> 00:29:34.860
And I'll reinforce
this much more

00:29:34.860 --> 00:29:38.370
when we talk about carbohydrate,
about nucleic acids.

00:29:38.370 --> 00:29:39.890
There's a numbering system.

00:29:39.890 --> 00:29:43.230
So two deoxyribose
is in your DNA.

00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:51.980
And ribose itself
is in your RNA.

00:29:51.980 --> 00:29:54.835
OK, so obviously, we need
to worry about carbohydrates

00:29:54.835 --> 00:29:56.210
and learn a little
bit about them

00:29:56.210 --> 00:29:58.260
based on that key criterion.

00:29:58.260 --> 00:30:02.330
OK, let's move now
to the hexoses.

00:30:02.330 --> 00:30:05.660
I'm not going to make you keep
drawing hexoses and things.

00:30:05.660 --> 00:30:08.090
I'm going to just tell you
a little bit about them

00:30:08.090 --> 00:30:10.220
with respect to
their structures.

00:30:10.220 --> 00:30:16.070
So I've shown you on the board
the cyclic form of a pentose.

00:30:16.070 --> 00:30:18.352
This is the linear form
and the cyclic form.

00:30:18.352 --> 00:30:19.310
Let me write that down.

00:30:25.060 --> 00:30:28.450
And by the way, in your DNA,
it's always in the cyclic form.

00:30:28.450 --> 00:30:30.310
It's not in the linear form.

00:30:30.310 --> 00:30:34.720
And the hexoses also have
a linear and a cyclic form.

00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:38.320
And I show you that
equilibrium for glucose.

00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:40.210
You see six carbons.

00:30:40.210 --> 00:30:41.530
I've got them numbered.

00:30:41.530 --> 00:30:45.220
And they form favorably
into the six-membered ring.

00:30:45.220 --> 00:30:47.470
This is the cyclic
form of glucose.

00:30:47.470 --> 00:30:49.870
This is the linear
form of glucose.

00:30:49.870 --> 00:30:53.080
When glucose associates
into polymers,

00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:56.890
it becomes these things
like cellulose or glycogen.

00:30:56.890 --> 00:30:59.920
And it depends a lot on the
linkages in those polymers

00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:02.000
to define which one it is.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:07.120
Now, as I mentioned,
carbohydrates aren't always

00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:09.430
just a series of OH groups.

00:31:09.430 --> 00:31:12.518
There's sometimes
other functionality.

00:31:12.518 --> 00:31:14.185
So I'm just going to
quickly draw those.

00:31:17.030 --> 00:31:22.310
And if you've got
them on your handouts,

00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:24.640
you can play along with me here.

00:31:29.230 --> 00:31:36.010
So sometimes,
there's an NH2 there.

00:31:36.010 --> 00:31:39.850
That's called glucose
amine, very creatively.

00:31:39.850 --> 00:31:46.840
Sometimes that NH2 is
converted to an amide,

00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:48.430
like that bond in a peptide.

00:31:48.430 --> 00:31:51.310
So it's glucose amide.

00:31:51.310 --> 00:31:54.640
And sometimes-- so you can
draw these on your handout,

00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:57.070
because the six-membered
rings are there.

00:31:57.070 --> 00:31:59.790
This stays as an OH.

00:31:59.790 --> 00:32:04.600
But this OH here is at a
different oxidation state.

00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:06.310
Don't worry about
that terminology.

00:32:06.310 --> 00:32:09.920
But what's important,
it's glucuronic acid.

00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:13.690
So it can be negatively charged,
positively charged, neutral.

00:32:13.690 --> 00:32:17.380
So there are variations
on a lot of our hexoses,

00:32:17.380 --> 00:32:20.380
basically meaning this
carbohydrate molecular formula

00:32:20.380 --> 00:32:21.340
doesn't work anymore.

00:32:21.340 --> 00:32:23.290
But the term has stuck.

00:32:23.290 --> 00:32:26.920
So there's quite a variety
of different carbohydrates

00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:28.510
with slight differences.

00:32:28.510 --> 00:32:31.840
And the intriguing thing
is that the carbohydrates

00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:35.710
that you and I use in all
of our physiologic processes

00:32:35.710 --> 00:32:37.780
are much simpler than
the carbohydrates

00:32:37.780 --> 00:32:39.450
that bacteria use.

00:32:39.450 --> 00:32:42.250
There is an expansion of
like 10 to the 2 or 10

00:32:42.250 --> 00:32:46.690
to the 3 in the variety of
sugars that bacteria use.

00:32:46.690 --> 00:32:49.280
And that's definitely a
story for another day.

00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:53.170
So let me now move on to
thinking about carbohydrates

00:32:53.170 --> 00:32:56.770
not as the monomers
that you metabolize,

00:32:56.770 --> 00:32:58.720
but rather as the
polymers that are

00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:01.930
involved in many other
different types of processes.

00:33:01.930 --> 00:33:03.760
And when we think
about the polymers,

00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:06.850
we want to think about
how their polymers differ

00:33:06.850 --> 00:33:11.290
from the polymers of
nucleic acids or proteins.

00:33:11.290 --> 00:33:14.260
Because this will tell
you why carbohydrates

00:33:14.260 --> 00:33:16.630
are so complicated.

00:33:16.630 --> 00:33:21.190
When you take a bunch of amino
acids and make a polymer,

00:33:21.190 --> 00:33:23.630
it's a linear polymer.

00:33:23.630 --> 00:33:25.940
Every unit is joined
to the next by a name.

00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:27.330
There's no branching there.

00:33:27.330 --> 00:33:28.990
It's just a linear polymer.

00:33:28.990 --> 00:33:31.960
So the diversity
is not enormous.

00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:33.190
Or-- it's pretty enormous.

00:33:33.190 --> 00:33:34.960
But it's not as
big as it could be

00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:38.380
if it were a branch polymer with
different types of side chains.

00:33:38.380 --> 00:33:42.740
We will see next week that the
polymers of the nucleic acids--

00:33:42.740 --> 00:33:44.130
here's the basic structure.

00:33:44.130 --> 00:33:45.910
There's the ribose, by the way.

00:33:45.910 --> 00:33:49.770
The R could be an OH or an H
attached to a base of purine

00:33:49.770 --> 00:33:52.070
or pyrimidine-- you don't
need to know that yet;

00:33:52.070 --> 00:33:53.260
you'll know it next week--

00:33:53.260 --> 00:33:54.730
and then to a phosphate.

00:33:54.730 --> 00:33:58.398
But those again,
are linear polymers.

00:33:58.398 --> 00:33:59.440
You don't have branching.

00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:02.020
You just have a single
continuous chain.

00:34:02.020 --> 00:34:04.330
The crazy thing about
sugars is they can

00:34:04.330 --> 00:34:06.680
branch from any of those OHs.

00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:11.500
So there's much more diversity
of structure and function

00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:13.750
wrapped in the
carbohydrates, which makes

00:34:13.750 --> 00:34:16.070
them real trouble to study.

00:34:16.070 --> 00:34:20.270
OK, I want to now introduce
you to another feature.

00:34:20.270 --> 00:34:22.659
The other thing is,
when we join amino acids

00:34:22.659 --> 00:34:27.190
or we join nucleic acid
building blocks, nucleosides,

00:34:27.190 --> 00:34:30.130
there's no difference in
the shapes that we can form.

00:34:30.130 --> 00:34:31.870
We don't have variety there.

00:34:31.870 --> 00:34:35.679
But in sugars, we can make
different kinds of linkages

00:34:35.679 --> 00:34:39.909
depending on how two OH
groups in a sugar are joined.

00:34:39.909 --> 00:34:43.520
So for example, if
you join two glucoses,

00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:46.790
in this kind of linkage,
that would give you maltose.

00:34:46.790 --> 00:34:50.837
But if you join two glucoses
in that kind of linkage,

00:34:50.837 --> 00:34:51.920
it would give you lactose.

00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:54.139
And those are
different compounds.

00:34:54.139 --> 00:34:58.060
They serve different types
of physiologic roles.

00:34:58.060 --> 00:35:02.750
And there are enzymes that
will make these bonds and then

00:35:02.750 --> 00:35:05.850
enzymes that will
break these bonds.

00:35:05.850 --> 00:35:11.040
There is a common disorder that
people have as they grow older.

00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:16.190
The enzyme that breaks
the lactose bond the gets

00:35:16.190 --> 00:35:16.790
turned off.

00:35:16.790 --> 00:35:18.210
It doesn't work anymore.

00:35:18.210 --> 00:35:20.510
And that's the enzyme, lactose.

00:35:20.510 --> 00:35:24.710
So when people are
intolerant to sugars--

00:35:24.710 --> 00:35:27.170
lactose is the sugar in milk.

00:35:27.170 --> 00:35:29.150
And they can't digest
dairy products.

00:35:29.150 --> 00:35:31.460
Because lactase
doesn't work anymore.

00:35:31.460 --> 00:35:32.690
Or you can take supplements.

00:35:32.690 --> 00:35:36.230
So that's how that
relates to physiology.

00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:38.990
The reaction
between two glucoses

00:35:38.990 --> 00:35:42.590
to make the disaccharide
is actually a condensation.

00:35:42.590 --> 00:35:45.470
Because when you join
that bond, you kick out

00:35:45.470 --> 00:35:47.750
water as a side product.

00:35:47.750 --> 00:35:51.360
Or when you break that
bond, you release water.

00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:54.500
So this is another one of
the condensation reactions.

00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:56.690
So underline that on the slide.

00:35:56.690 --> 00:35:58.940
Because condensation
means a reaction

00:35:58.940 --> 00:36:02.150
that precedes and produces
you a molecule of water.

00:36:08.030 --> 00:36:10.610
And this just sums up
the lactase problem,

00:36:10.610 --> 00:36:13.790
where you can digest
lactose, the milk sugar.

00:36:13.790 --> 00:36:15.980
OK, so those are monomers.

00:36:15.980 --> 00:36:19.550
Now let's think about polymers
and complex structures

00:36:19.550 --> 00:36:20.870
of sugars.

00:36:20.870 --> 00:36:22.580
And I put these
all on the slides,

00:36:22.580 --> 00:36:25.800
because it's just impossible
for you to keep drawing them.

00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:28.535
And I'm just going to give you
sort of one of my pet peeves.

00:36:31.070 --> 00:36:34.670
I draw sugars like this.

00:36:34.670 --> 00:36:39.020
A lot of other people
draw sugars like that.

00:36:41.700 --> 00:36:42.660
And I don't like that.

00:36:42.660 --> 00:36:44.350
Because this is
what they look like.

00:36:44.350 --> 00:36:46.530
So if you see this
and you go, I haven't

00:36:46.530 --> 00:36:49.740
seen sugars looking
like that before, it's

00:36:49.740 --> 00:36:55.830
because this is the way to draw
them that actually represents

00:36:55.830 --> 00:36:56.580
their shape.

00:36:56.580 --> 00:36:59.100
So if it's unusual
format to you,

00:36:59.100 --> 00:37:02.050
I'm not going to ask
you to construct these.

00:37:02.050 --> 00:37:05.310
I just want you to be familiar
with looking at them like this

00:37:05.310 --> 00:37:06.750
rather than like this.

00:37:06.750 --> 00:37:11.210
Because, to me, that's the
best way to render them.

00:37:11.210 --> 00:37:12.960
OK, so polymers of sugar.

00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:14.790
I just mentioned
to you, there are

00:37:14.790 --> 00:37:18.300
polymers of sugars that
are important to storage.

00:37:18.300 --> 00:37:21.270
So when we have
excess glucose, we

00:37:21.270 --> 00:37:26.520
store glucose as glycogen.
It's often stored in the liver.

00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:28.140
And later on in
the semester, we'll

00:37:28.140 --> 00:37:31.410
see how a bolt of
adrenaline sets

00:37:31.410 --> 00:37:34.560
all the processes in
motion to chew up glycogen,

00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:37.860
to release more glucose so
you can have a lot of energy

00:37:37.860 --> 00:37:39.600
quickly.

00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:44.280
So in that polymer, the sugars
are linked in a different way.

00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:48.060
The common polymer in
plants and, in fact,

00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:51.360
accounts for a massive
proportion of the biomass,

00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:53.670
is a different
polymer of glucose

00:37:53.670 --> 00:37:56.640
where the linkages are beta--

00:37:56.640 --> 00:37:58.240
we would call this
a beta linkage.

00:37:58.240 --> 00:37:59.520
But that's the way it looks.

00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:01.200
And that would be cellulose.

00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:02.910
And it's a linear polymer.

00:38:02.910 --> 00:38:07.290
Coming down here, glycogen
is often a branched polymer

00:38:07.290 --> 00:38:10.760
with different kinds of
linkages with different aspects

00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:12.220
or different shapes.

00:38:12.220 --> 00:38:16.110
So the glycogen that we
store and can break down

00:38:16.110 --> 00:38:20.790
in order to produce glucose
to make energy is glycogen.

00:38:20.790 --> 00:38:23.940
We cannot break down cellulose.

00:38:23.940 --> 00:38:26.610
We don't digest plant
cellulose, because we

00:38:26.610 --> 00:38:28.560
don't have those
enzymes, which is

00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:30.750
why we don't get
nutritional value out

00:38:30.750 --> 00:38:35.190
of the cellulose the same way
we can put forces in action

00:38:35.190 --> 00:38:36.970
to break down glucose.

00:38:36.970 --> 00:38:42.180
So the way those bonds look
is absolutely critical for how

00:38:42.180 --> 00:38:45.750
you can use the energy that's
within them by using enzymes

00:38:45.750 --> 00:38:46.890
to break those bonds.

00:38:49.830 --> 00:38:52.700
OK, so in general--

00:38:52.700 --> 00:38:53.940
I've just said that.

00:38:53.940 --> 00:38:59.100
Glucose can be stored a
cellulose or as glycogen.

00:38:59.100 --> 00:39:04.500
The process of photosynthesis
converts energy and sunlight

00:39:04.500 --> 00:39:08.190
into glucose.

00:39:08.190 --> 00:39:11.160
And then you can make
the polymers of glucose.

00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:13.410
And what I'm showing you
here in these polymers

00:39:13.410 --> 00:39:15.720
is a simplified view.

00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:18.900
I want to introduce
to you one other term.

00:39:18.900 --> 00:39:20.250
And that term is glycan.

00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:26.640
And that basically
refers to something

00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:29.580
that is more than one
sugar, one carbohydrate.

00:39:35.398 --> 00:39:37.190
I was looking at the
videos of my lectures.

00:39:37.190 --> 00:39:39.120
I realized my
handwriting is horrible.

00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:41.450
So I'm really trying very
hard to make it a little bit

00:39:41.450 --> 00:39:42.740
neater today.

00:39:42.740 --> 00:39:46.070
So glycan is just the name
for a polymer of sugars.

00:39:46.070 --> 00:39:50.880
But they can also be
called polysaccharides.

00:39:56.550 --> 00:39:59.340
But glycan now is the
commonly accepted term

00:39:59.340 --> 00:40:00.610
for a lot of sugars.

00:40:00.610 --> 00:40:03.180
Now, I told you
about energy storage.

00:40:03.180 --> 00:40:05.370
I've told you about
simple disaccharides

00:40:05.370 --> 00:40:07.680
and monosaccharides
and metabolism.

00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:09.570
But what I want to
do now is give you

00:40:09.570 --> 00:40:13.380
a little overview of all
the different places where

00:40:13.380 --> 00:40:15.138
sugars feature in a cell.

00:40:15.138 --> 00:40:16.680
Because I think it's
really important

00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:20.670
to realize that sugars
form a great sort of set

00:40:20.670 --> 00:40:23.640
of molecules for communication.

00:40:23.640 --> 00:40:25.200
So I'm going to go
around this sort

00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:27.860
of funny looking square cell.

00:40:27.860 --> 00:40:29.670
And this would be
a eukaryotic cell,

00:40:29.670 --> 00:40:31.230
because it's got a nucleus.

00:40:31.230 --> 00:40:33.150
And there are
different compartments.

00:40:33.150 --> 00:40:36.510
So within the
cell, the cell sits

00:40:36.510 --> 00:40:39.300
in what's known as an
extracellular matrix.

00:40:39.300 --> 00:40:42.930
It's a mesh work
of sugar polymers

00:40:42.930 --> 00:40:44.980
that actually is
important for the cells

00:40:44.980 --> 00:40:48.180
and important for trapping
signals that come from cells

00:40:48.180 --> 00:40:49.720
and go to other cells.

00:40:49.720 --> 00:40:53.940
So those are all predominantly
made up of carbohydrate.

00:40:53.940 --> 00:40:55.740
The next thing to
look at is that there

00:40:55.740 --> 00:40:58.880
are proteins within the cell.

00:40:58.880 --> 00:41:03.120
They can become modified with
a sugar and go to the nucleus

00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:04.420
or leave the nucleus.

00:41:04.420 --> 00:41:08.340
So there is a type of signaling
that is based on adding a sugar

00:41:08.340 --> 00:41:10.500
or taking it off a protein.

00:41:10.500 --> 00:41:13.950
We'll see later in the semester
how also phosphorylation

00:41:13.950 --> 00:41:17.070
does a lot of functions
that look like that.

00:41:17.070 --> 00:41:20.340
There are sugars that are
displayed on the cell surface

00:41:20.340 --> 00:41:21.450
polymers.

00:41:21.450 --> 00:41:23.610
And that's where signaling
becomes important.

00:41:23.610 --> 00:41:26.490
Because sugars may be
attached to lipids.

00:41:26.490 --> 00:41:28.980
You remember, we've
talked about phospholipids

00:41:28.980 --> 00:41:30.630
being part of the membrane.

00:41:30.630 --> 00:41:33.810
Sugars can be attached to
lipids that sit in the membrane

00:41:33.810 --> 00:41:34.650
and face out.

00:41:34.650 --> 00:41:37.650
And it's how cell-cell
communication

00:41:37.650 --> 00:41:39.930
occurs in some instances.

00:41:39.930 --> 00:41:42.960
Or they may be
attached to proteins

00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:45.940
that are also displayed on
the surface of the cell.

00:41:45.940 --> 00:41:48.390
So this tells you a
little bit about where

00:41:48.390 --> 00:41:52.110
we put these sugars is what's
responsible for communication.

00:41:52.110 --> 00:41:55.560
Because they're on the surface
of the cell with their sides

00:41:55.560 --> 00:41:58.360
out.

00:41:58.360 --> 00:42:00.490
And then the final thing
I want to talk about

00:42:00.490 --> 00:42:02.270
is the blood group system.

00:42:02.270 --> 00:42:05.770
So a lot of you may be
aware of blood groups.

00:42:05.770 --> 00:42:08.860
There are four
principal blood groups.

00:42:08.860 --> 00:42:12.850
The differences between the
blood in a A, B, AB and O blood

00:42:12.850 --> 00:42:16.720
groups are differences in just
the sugars that are attached

00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:18.440
to the surface of the cell.

00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:19.960
So let me describe those.

00:42:19.960 --> 00:42:22.360
And then we'll talk about
blood groups and things that

00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:27.250
are being done to enhance the
supplies of red blood cells

00:42:27.250 --> 00:42:28.590
in cases of emergency.

00:42:28.590 --> 00:42:31.420
I have a nice little video
I'm hoping to get to.

00:42:31.420 --> 00:42:33.310
So on the surface
of the cell, you

00:42:33.310 --> 00:42:35.150
might have different sugars.

00:42:35.150 --> 00:42:37.930
This is a trisaccharide.

00:42:37.930 --> 00:42:40.680
All right, you can see
one, two, three sugars.

00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:41.940
They have different linkages.

00:42:41.940 --> 00:42:43.710
But you can pick out the sugars.

00:42:43.710 --> 00:42:53.250
And they are joined by a
bond called a glycoside bond

00:42:53.250 --> 00:42:54.405
and those join sugars.

00:42:59.700 --> 00:43:02.370
So what do you think the enzyme
that cleaves the glycoside is?

00:43:06.362 --> 00:43:08.360
STUDENT: Glycosidase.

00:43:08.360 --> 00:43:10.040
PROFESSOR: Glycosidase.

00:43:10.040 --> 00:43:11.300
You would say glycosidase.

00:43:11.300 --> 00:43:12.530
I would say glycosidase.

00:43:12.530 --> 00:43:13.940
But if they are the same thing.

00:43:16.890 --> 00:43:19.310
And that's going to be
pertinent in a minute.

00:43:22.750 --> 00:43:25.970
So remember, if in doubt,
guess and stick "ase"

00:43:25.970 --> 00:43:27.970
at the end if I ask you
the name of an enzyme,

00:43:27.970 --> 00:43:29.570
because that works pretty well.

00:43:29.570 --> 00:43:31.870
So if you have O
blood group, you

00:43:31.870 --> 00:43:36.820
would have exclusively this
trisaccharide on your red blood

00:43:36.820 --> 00:43:37.790
cells.

00:43:37.790 --> 00:43:40.060
If you have the A
blood group, you

00:43:40.060 --> 00:43:42.550
have an extra sugar attached
to that trisaccharide.

00:43:42.550 --> 00:43:47.470
And it's a glucosamide sugar.

00:43:47.470 --> 00:43:53.380
There's an extra carbonyl
group on an amide.

00:43:53.380 --> 00:43:56.990
And if you have B blood
group, it's gluco--

00:43:56.990 --> 00:43:57.770
it's a sugar.

00:43:57.770 --> 00:43:59.410
It's actually called galactose.

00:43:59.410 --> 00:44:02.200
That has all OH groups.

00:44:02.200 --> 00:44:05.110
So the differences
between if you're O group,

00:44:05.110 --> 00:44:07.590
if you're A group,
or if you're B group,

00:44:07.590 --> 00:44:10.270
adjust those
differences in sugars.

00:44:10.270 --> 00:44:13.960
And then people who have AB
blood group have a composite.

00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:17.890
They have a mixture of the
A and the B blood group.

00:44:17.890 --> 00:44:20.824
So do you-- yeah, question.

00:44:20.824 --> 00:44:22.600
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:22.600 --> 00:44:26.650
PROFESSOR: That's
a second marker,

00:44:26.650 --> 00:44:28.450
which we won't talk about.

00:44:28.450 --> 00:44:32.110
So it's A plus another
marker that's either

00:44:32.110 --> 00:44:34.060
one type or another type.

00:44:34.060 --> 00:44:36.430
But the AB and O are
defined by the sugars.

00:44:36.430 --> 00:44:38.560
Yeah, good question.

00:44:38.560 --> 00:44:42.810
OK, so do people know
their blood group?

00:44:42.810 --> 00:44:44.340
It's good to know, frankly.

00:44:44.340 --> 00:44:46.792
Because someone-- you know,
you may you cut yourself.

00:44:46.792 --> 00:44:48.750
And someone says, do you
know your blood group?

00:44:48.750 --> 00:44:49.542
And you'll go, yes.

00:44:49.542 --> 00:44:51.745
And they'll give you
an on-site transfusion.

00:44:51.745 --> 00:44:53.370
I've been watching
too much Jack Bauer.

00:44:53.370 --> 00:44:58.950
But, you know, that's a story
for another day as well.

00:44:58.950 --> 00:45:01.200
So it turns out that
depending on blood groups,

00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:05.500
you can either be a universal
donor or a universal acceptor.

00:45:05.500 --> 00:45:07.860
So the people with
the O blood group

00:45:07.860 --> 00:45:10.560
can give anyone their blood.

00:45:10.560 --> 00:45:13.380
People with O, A, B, and AB.

00:45:13.380 --> 00:45:17.360
But unfortunately for the poor
people with O blood group is

00:45:17.360 --> 00:45:22.080
that they cannot receive blood
from blood group A, B, or AB.

00:45:22.080 --> 00:45:23.760
And I wanted to show this.

00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:25.650
And I hope I can get it working.

00:45:25.650 --> 00:45:27.670
Because we have just the
right amount of time,

00:45:27.670 --> 00:45:29.820
which makes me really happy.

00:45:29.820 --> 00:45:33.030
Because I don't really program
things that well sometimes.

00:45:33.030 --> 00:45:36.340
There was a pay-- there was--

00:45:36.340 --> 00:45:38.130
the latest American chemist--

00:45:38.130 --> 00:45:39.380
NARRATOR: --or other disaster.

00:45:39.380 --> 00:45:41.300
Those who are affected
by crisis usually

00:45:41.300 --> 00:45:45.740
need four vital things, food,
shelter, water and blood.

00:45:45.740 --> 00:45:48.590
In particular, O-type blood,
because it can be safely given

00:45:48.590 --> 00:45:49.790
to any patient.

00:45:49.790 --> 00:45:52.250
Now, scientists say they
have identified enzymes

00:45:52.250 --> 00:45:55.610
from the human gut that can turn
type A and B blood into type

00:45:55.610 --> 00:45:58.310
O up to 30 times more
efficiently than previously

00:45:58.310 --> 00:45:59.720
studied enzymes.

00:45:59.720 --> 00:46:01.823
Type A or B blood
has specific sugars

00:46:01.823 --> 00:46:02.990
on the outside of its cells.

00:46:02.990 --> 00:46:03.650
PROFESSOR: I just described--

00:46:03.650 --> 00:46:04.880
NARRATOR: These
sugars are recognized

00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:05.932
by the immune system.

00:46:05.932 --> 00:46:07.640
And if they don't
match the type of blood

00:46:07.640 --> 00:46:10.880
that's already in an individual,
those cells are destroyed.

00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:12.590
Because these sugars
are recognized

00:46:12.590 --> 00:46:15.020
by the immune system,
they're called antigens.

00:46:15.020 --> 00:46:17.360
Type AB blood has both antigens.

00:46:17.360 --> 00:46:19.100
And type O blood has none.

00:46:19.100 --> 00:46:20.900
The researchers
presented these findings

00:46:20.900 --> 00:46:22.790
at the recent American
Chemical Society

00:46:22.790 --> 00:46:24.620
National Meeting in Boston.

00:46:24.620 --> 00:46:27.590
Stephen Withers from the
University of British Columbia

00:46:27.590 --> 00:46:30.080
has been studying enzymes
that remove A or B

00:46:30.080 --> 00:46:32.190
antigens from red blood cells.

00:46:32.190 --> 00:46:33.950
If those antigens
can be removed,

00:46:33.950 --> 00:46:37.190
then type A or B can be
converted to type O blood.

00:46:37.190 --> 00:46:38.900
To find the enzymes
more quickly,

00:46:38.900 --> 00:46:41.690
Withers and a colleague at his
institution used a technique

00:46:41.690 --> 00:46:44.330
called metagenomics,
which allows scientists

00:46:44.330 --> 00:46:46.880
to sample the genes of
millions of microorganisms

00:46:46.880 --> 00:46:49.070
without the need
for individual c--

00:46:49.070 --> 00:46:50.720
PROFESSOR: So that
tells you something

00:46:50.720 --> 00:46:55.100
about technology and engineering
and understanding structures.

00:46:55.100 --> 00:46:57.810
So it would be
really advantageous.

00:46:57.810 --> 00:47:00.590
The stage at which you
really need blood supplies

00:47:00.590 --> 00:47:02.600
is to take all the
blood in the blood banks

00:47:02.600 --> 00:47:05.720
and turn everything
into a universal donor.

00:47:05.720 --> 00:47:08.810
But the blood banks keep
these differentiated supplies

00:47:08.810 --> 00:47:09.620
of blood.

00:47:09.620 --> 00:47:13.160
But what if you need something
that you can give everyone

00:47:13.160 --> 00:47:14.300
safely?

00:47:14.300 --> 00:47:17.000
And so there are
enzymes in the gut.

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:20.810
There are bacteria in the
gut that actually live off

00:47:20.810 --> 00:47:22.790
of sugars that
they chop off cells

00:47:22.790 --> 00:47:30.690
in the matrix in the GI system.

00:47:30.690 --> 00:47:32.600
And so what the
Withers group did

00:47:32.600 --> 00:47:35.870
was to screen a lot
of different enzymes

00:47:35.870 --> 00:47:39.410
from bacteria in
the gut and find

00:47:39.410 --> 00:47:42.530
ones that had a really good
specificity for removing

00:47:42.530 --> 00:47:43.820
those sugars.

00:47:43.820 --> 00:47:45.740
Then they did
protein engineering

00:47:45.740 --> 00:47:48.410
work to make them
more efficient,

00:47:48.410 --> 00:47:50.450
thus creating something
that was proposed

00:47:50.450 --> 00:47:53.690
a long time ago as could
be useful, but now really

00:47:53.690 --> 00:47:54.860
making it useful.

00:47:54.860 --> 00:47:57.380
Because those enzymes
are much more efficient.

00:47:57.380 --> 00:48:00.050
They really catalyze
reactions at great speed.

00:48:00.050 --> 00:48:03.080
So they're much more
efficient engineering enzymes

00:48:03.080 --> 00:48:04.760
to treat your blood
cells, to make

00:48:04.760 --> 00:48:08.390
sure you get rid
of all the features

00:48:08.390 --> 00:48:12.300
that are characteristic of the
A, the B, and the AB antigens.

00:48:12.300 --> 00:48:14.750
Because if you don't
do a good job of it,

00:48:14.750 --> 00:48:16.640
then the human
immune system will

00:48:16.640 --> 00:48:19.220
recognize the little
bits that sneak in

00:48:19.220 --> 00:48:21.780
and start triggering
an immune response.

00:48:21.780 --> 00:48:24.770
So the efficiency of the enzymes
that cleave those sugars off

00:48:24.770 --> 00:48:26.730
is absolutely paramount.

00:48:26.730 --> 00:48:29.670
And that's what I
have for you today.

00:48:29.670 --> 00:48:31.340
I will see you Monday,
so don't forget.

00:48:31.340 --> 00:48:34.310
The Pset's due at 3:00.

00:48:34.310 --> 00:48:39.620
Monday, I would like for you
to have a preview of the--

00:48:39.620 --> 00:48:44.822
whoops, come on-- of the
DNA reading material.

00:48:44.822 --> 00:48:46.280
I don't know if
any of you do this.

00:48:46.280 --> 00:48:48.020
But I think it's really handy.

00:48:48.020 --> 00:48:50.110
So there's just some
very little sections

00:48:50.110 --> 00:48:53.600
that will give you a bit of
exposure to nucleic acids.

00:48:53.600 --> 00:48:55.730
It'll just make the
lecture a little bit more

00:48:55.730 --> 00:48:56.610
kind of familiar.

00:48:56.610 --> 00:48:59.350
But that's what
we're up for Monday.

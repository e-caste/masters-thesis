00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:24.120
JAKE XIA: This is the second
time we are having this class.

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:27.900
We had it last year
in a smaller version.

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.510
That was for six
units of a credit,

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.729
and we had it once a week.

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:36.440
And mostly practitioners
from the industry,

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.980
from Morgan Stanley,
talking about examples

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.760
how math is applied
in modern finance.

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.000
And so we got some good
response last year.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.480
So, with the support
of the math department,

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:58.600
we decided to expand this
class to be 12 units of credit

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.170
and have twice a week.

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.900
So, we have every Tuesday
and Thursday afternoon

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.645
from 2:30 to 4:00, as you
know, in this classroom.

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.220
So last year, Dr. Vasily
Strela and I-- by the way,

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.060
I'm Jake Xia and
that's Dr. Vasily,

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.660
and we were the main
instructors last year.

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:22.500
Now we doubled it up to
four main instructors.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.430
That's Dr. Peter Kempthorne
and Dr. Choongbum Lee.

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.090
The reason we doubled
up the main instructors

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.850
is we have newly added math
lectures, mostly focusing

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.510
from linear algebra,
probability to statistics,

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:42.100
and some stochastic calculus
to give you the foundation

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.990
to understand the
math will be used

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:52.680
in those examples in the lecture
taught by the practitioners

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.440
from the industry.

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.370
And the purpose of
this course is really

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:02.580
to give you a sampling menu to
see how mathematics is applied

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.860
in modern finance and help you
to decide if this is a field

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:06.670
that you would be--

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:08.461
RECORDED VOICE: Thank
you, for using WebEx.

00:02:08.461 --> 00:02:14.170
Please visit our website
at www.webex.com.

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.590
JAKE XIA: OK, you heard that.

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.010
And so hopefully, this will
give you enough information

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.090
to decide this is a field
you would like to pursue

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.560
in your future career.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.150
In fact, last year when
we finished the class,

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.660
we had a few students coming
to work in the industry.

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.925
Some work at Morgan Stanley,
some work at elsewhere.

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.200
So that's really the goal.

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.500
And at the same
time, obviously, you

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.940
will further solidify
your math knowledge

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.090
and learn new content.

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.590
And we put the prerequisite
about the math part a bit

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.470
later.

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.020
So I will use today's
first lecture's time

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:02.330
to give you an
introduction, really,

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.600
to prepare you some basic
background knowledge

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.150
about the financial markets.

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.680
Some terminologies
will be used, which

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.490
you may not have heard before.

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:16.370
So before I get into
the introduction,

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.160
I always like to know who are
actually in the classroom,

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:20.910
so let me ask you
a few questions.

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.740
You just need to
raise your hands

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:28.260
so I know roughly what kind of
background and where you are.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:33.390
So how many undergraduate
students are here?

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:35.950
So I would say 80% percent.

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:42.020
How many graduate students
are here, just to verify?

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:44.320
Yep, that's about right, 20%.

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:51.500
And how many students are in
finance and business major?

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.130
Just one.

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:56.510
And how many of you
are a math major?

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:58.260
Most of you.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:02.540
How many of you are
engineering majors?

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:03.650
A few.

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:08.810
How many of you actually
are from other universities?

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:11.160
Great, because last
year we had quite a few,

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.670
so I want to
specifically tell you

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:17.490
that you're very welcome
to attend the classes here.

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:19.329
So it's open door.

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:22.970
And last year I remember
we had a couple of students

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:24.360
from Harvard.

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.010
That's where I actually
work right now.

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.820
I forgot to mention
that, but I'm

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.550
affiliated with both the math
department and the Sloan school

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:37.740
here.

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.110
So anyway, thanks for that.

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:41.900
We will be doing a bit
more polling along the way,

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:46.120
mainly to get feedback of
how you feel about the class.

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.630
Last year we had it
online, so if you

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:50.780
feel the class is
going too fast,

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:52.480
or the math part
is going too slow,

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.930
or the finance part
is a bit confusing,

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:57.730
the easiest way is
really just to send us

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:02.520
emails, which you will find
from the class website.

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:03.870
So anyway, today--

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:06.210
VASILY STRELA: And all
of us got MIT emails.

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:07.260
JAKE XIA: Yes.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.026
We all have MIT emails, which
are listed on the website.

00:05:10.026 --> 00:05:11.150
VASILY STRELA: [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:17.080
JAKE XIA: And obviously,
we have offices here.

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:21.960
You can easily stop by Peter
and Choongbum's offices.

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:26.500
And Vasily and I probably
will be less often on campus,

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:30.810
but we'll be here quite often
and definitely love to be more.

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:35.240
So anyway, I will start
today's lecture with a story,

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.840
and a quiz at the end.

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:39.440
Don't worry, it's
not a real quiz.

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:40.940
Just going to ask
you some questions

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:43.960
you can raise your hand
and give your answer.

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:46.420
But let me start with my story.

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:49.340
This is actually
my personal story.

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:52.310
I want to tell you why
I tell the story later.

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:56.600
But the story actually
was in the mid '90s.

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:01.510
I just left Salomon Brothers
-- that was my first financial

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:06.990
industry job -- to go to Morgan
Stanley in New York to join

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:09.760
the options trading desk.

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:15.320
So the first day, I sat down,
I opened the trading book,

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:18.890
I found something was missing.

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:22.600
So, I turned around,
I asked my desk quant.

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:26.240
I said, where is
the vega report?

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:27.680
So, let me show you.

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:33.050
So that's the story.

00:06:36.102 --> 00:06:39.060
So I'm obviously not going
to tell you the story of Pi

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:40.130
or "Life of Pi."

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:42.830
That's not a financial story.

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:45.460
The rest of the story,
alpha, beta, delta, gamma,

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:49.450
theta, which you will learn
from Peter and Choongbum

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:50.980
and Vasily's classes.

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:53.079
So I'm going to talk about vega.

00:06:53.079 --> 00:06:54.870
So by the way, before
I tell you the story,

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:57.794
what's unique about
vega on this list?

00:06:57.794 --> 00:06:59.210
AUDIENCE: It's not
a Greek letter.

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:00.626
JAKE XIA: It's not
a Greek letter.

00:07:00.626 --> 00:07:02.070
That's right.

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:04.390
So I turned around and
asked my desk quant, I said,

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:05.860
where's the vega report?

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:09.862
But how many of you actually
know what a vega is?

00:07:09.862 --> 00:07:10.820
OK, lot of people know.

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:13.720
So anyway, I'm not
going to-- just

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:16.490
for the people who haven't
heard about it before, it's

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:20.230
a measurement about
a book or portfolio

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:22.930
or position's sensitivity
to volatility.

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:24.400
So, what is volatility?

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:29.480
Which again, you will learn
more in rigorous terms

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:31.440
how it's defined in mathematics.

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:36.040
But the meaning of it is really
a measurement or indication

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:40.880
of how volatile, or what's the
standard deviation of a price

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:43.080
can change over time.

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:44.830
That's all you need
to know right now.

00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:47.480
I'm not going to ask
you questions later.

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:52.737
So my desk quant
look at me, said--

00:07:52.737 --> 00:07:54.320
this is supposed to
be options trading

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:58.120
desk, so he look at me puzzled.

00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:00.020
So instead of
answering my question,

00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:02.780
he handed over me
a training manual

00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:06.940
for new employees
and new analysts.

00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:10.370
So I opened the training
manual and looked it through.

00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:12.630
I actually found my answer.

00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:16.150
So actually, at Morgan Stanley
this is not called vega,

00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:17.760
it's called kappa.

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:20.030
So now, I remember
to call it kappa.

00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:21.980
Kappa is actually
a Greek letter.

00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:25.590
So further, I look
on the same page

00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:29.750
there was actually a
footnote, which I copied down.

00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:39.659
So the footnote about why it's
called kappa at Morgan Stanley.

00:08:39.659 --> 00:08:43.244
Kappa is also called vega
by some uneducated traders

00:08:43.244 --> 00:08:45.099
at the Salomon Brothers.

00:08:45.099 --> 00:08:46.140
That's where I came from.

00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:47.850
I just joined.

00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:50.800
They have mistaken
vega as a Greek letter

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:52.080
after gambling at Vegas.

00:08:55.370 --> 00:08:58.510
So anyway, so that
was my first day.

00:08:58.510 --> 00:09:02.640
So obviously, I learned
how to call kappa

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:05.580
very quickly, because I
came from Salomon Brothers.

00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:09.790
And I called it kappa
in the last 17 years,

00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:12.090
but you will hear
people calling it vega.

00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:14.580
Obviously, I have probably more
people calling it the vega.

00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:19.300
But anyway, so that's my
first day at Morgan Stanley.

00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:21.750
But why did I tell
you the story?

00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:24.960
What point I try to make?

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:29.270
So this story is actually--
when you think about it,

00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:33.970
mathematical or quantitative
finance is a rather new field.

00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:37.990
A lot of these terms
were newly introduced.

00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:42.860
And the pricing model
of options, as you know,

00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:47.410
was introduced in the
Black-Scholes in the '70s,

00:09:47.410 --> 00:09:49.830
or some of the ground work
may be done a bit earlier.

00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:55.770
But it's not like finance
was a quantitative profession

00:09:55.770 --> 00:09:57.090
to start with.

00:09:57.090 --> 00:09:59.720
So what we witness
in the last 30 years

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:04.490
was really a transformation of
the trading profession coming

00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:09.320
from mostly
under-educated traders.

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:13.280
Some of them typically joined
the firms in the mail room

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:15.080
and became trader later on.

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:17.360
That's typical career path.

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:20.260
And to nowadays, if you
walk on the trading floor,

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:24.510
you talk to the traders, most
of them have advanced degrees

00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:29.950
and quite a few of them
have very high training

00:10:29.950 --> 00:10:32.580
in mathematics and
computer science.

00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:36.820
So what has changed over
the last 20 or 30 years?

00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:40.690
I myself, personally, was
probably one of the data

00:10:40.690 --> 00:10:44.370
point experiencing this change.

00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:49.270
And I certainly
didn't expect I would

00:10:49.270 --> 00:10:51.880
be doing this when
I was at MIT, but I

00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:55.990
did that in the last 20 years.

00:10:55.990 --> 00:10:59.030
So the point I'm
trying to tell you

00:10:59.030 --> 00:11:04.120
is, before you dive into
any details of mathematics

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:11.220
or any concept in finance in
this class, just bear in mind,

00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:16.240
this is a field developed in the
last mostly 30 years, or even

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:17.170
shorter.

00:11:17.170 --> 00:11:19.890
And what you really
need to ask questions

00:11:19.890 --> 00:11:26.790
is-- it's not really is it
right or wrong in mathematics,

00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:28.975
is it right or wrong in physics?

00:11:28.975 --> 00:11:31.920
So, how the concepts
are established

00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:35.110
and defined and verified.

00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:37.170
Because this is a field--
the transformation

00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:42.310
about the participants,
products, models, methodology,

00:11:42.310 --> 00:11:44.400
everything are
changing very rapidly.

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:46.630
Even nowadays, they're
still changing.

00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:51.720
So with that, I will
give you some background

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:57.160
on how the financial
markets actually started,

00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:03.700
and that's really the history
part of this industry.

00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:07.960
So, when we talk about
markets, we know in early days

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:10.430
people need to exchange goods.

00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:11.970
You have something
I don't have, I

00:12:11.970 --> 00:12:15.730
have something you don't
have, so there's exchanges.

00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:17.500
Then it becomes centralized.

00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:20.530
There are stock exchanges,
futures exchanges all

00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:22.940
over the world where
these products will

00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:27.310
be listed as securities
on these exchanges.

00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:30.560
That's one way of trading,
which is centralized.

00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:32.680
Obviously, in the
last 10, 15 years,

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:37.010
now we have ECNs,
electronic platforms.

00:12:37.010 --> 00:12:41.270
Trade over-- you know, even
larger volume of those trades.

00:12:41.270 --> 00:12:47.070
So, financial products is
really just one form of trading.

00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:52.070
There are many other ways of
trading aside from exchanges.

00:12:52.070 --> 00:12:55.650
One of them, which
is called OTC,

00:12:55.650 --> 00:13:00.600
is over-the-counter, meaning
two counterparties agree

00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:05.920
to do a trade without really
subject to the exchange rules,

00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:09.580
or the underlying trading
agreement does not

00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:13.640
have to be a securitized
product, or standardized,

00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:16.390
or whatever ways you define it.

00:13:16.390 --> 00:13:18.770
And the different regions
have different exchanges

00:13:18.770 --> 00:13:20.730
and markets, as well.

00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:25.160
And they typically specialize
in local products, local company

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:31.900
stocks, local bonds,
and local currencies.

00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:33.910
So, there are many
different forms.

00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:37.780
So again, what's in common?

00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:39.650
That's the question
you need to ask.

00:13:39.650 --> 00:13:42.350
Also, you don't
know the specifics.

00:13:42.350 --> 00:13:47.280
And the currencies, money
itself, are also traded.

00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:50.490
And that's where
different currencies

00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:52.510
issued by different countries.

00:13:52.510 --> 00:13:54.810
So, when we talk
about trading stocks--

00:13:54.810 --> 00:13:57.750
there are also people
trade baskets of stocks,

00:13:57.750 --> 00:14:00.300
trade groups of stocks
together, and that's

00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:03.720
stock index or indices.

00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:06.090
So, there are
different products.

00:14:06.090 --> 00:14:09.170
How the stock get listed
on the stock exchange?

00:14:09.170 --> 00:14:13.210
It goes through IPO-- Initial
Public Offering process.

00:14:13.210 --> 00:14:17.340
So, when a company changes
from private to public,

00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:19.490
it goes through
this IPO process.

00:14:19.490 --> 00:14:23.160
It's called primary
market, primary listing.

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:28.240
And once the stock is
listed on the exchange

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:30.800
and it becomes
traded in the market,

00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:32.420
we call it secondary trading.

00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:36.270
So, that's after
the primary market.

00:14:36.270 --> 00:14:40.840
And equity or stock
is one form of trading

00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:43.670
or one form of
financial products.

00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:45.500
What are other forms?

00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:46.520
Loans.

00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:52.110
Actually, debt products are more
generic than equity products.

00:14:52.110 --> 00:14:55.700
When you started
thinking about it,

00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:57.430
what is really finance is about?

00:14:57.430 --> 00:15:01.560
It's really about someone
has money, someone doesn't.

00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:05.480
Someone has money to lend out,
someone needs to borrow money.

00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:07.220
So, that's loan.

00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:09.490
Loan is really a
private agreement

00:15:09.490 --> 00:15:13.140
between two counterparties
or multiple counterparties.

00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:16.610
When you securitize
them, they become bonds.

00:15:16.610 --> 00:15:20.370
And when you look at
bonds, every government

00:15:20.370 --> 00:15:22.830
will issue large sovereign debt.

00:15:22.830 --> 00:15:27.660
So, US government has large
outstanding US Treasury debt--

00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:29.890
bonds, notes, bills.

00:15:29.890 --> 00:15:34.810
And corporates have issued a
lot of debt product, as well.

00:15:34.810 --> 00:15:37.640
They borrow money when they
need to build a new factory

00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:39.190
or expand.

00:15:39.190 --> 00:15:41.190
Universities borrow money.

00:15:41.190 --> 00:15:45.270
When MIT needs to build a new
building, some of the money

00:15:45.270 --> 00:15:47.640
will come from the
endowment support,

00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:52.440
some will come from some
other form of research budget,

00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:55.570
or some will come
from debt financing.

00:15:55.570 --> 00:15:58.820
Just borrow from the
public-- local governments,

00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:01.370
states, counties, even.

00:16:01.370 --> 00:16:04.510
So, they have various forms.

00:16:04.510 --> 00:16:05.620
So, that's debt product.

00:16:05.620 --> 00:16:10.120
Commodities, actually, you know.

00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:13.490
Metal, energy,
agriculture products

00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:15.580
are traded, mostly
in the futures

00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:17.610
format and some in
physical format,

00:16:17.610 --> 00:16:19.350
meaning you take deliveries.

00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:21.590
When you actually
buying and sell,

00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:23.540
you build a warehouse
to take them.

00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:29.870
You ship a tank to
store above the ocean.

00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:33.480
And the real estate, you're
buying and sell houses.

00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:36.960
2008 financial crisis,
if you read about it,

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:39.000
this has a lot to do
with the real estate

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:44.580
market, the mortgages, and
asset-backed securities.

00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:46.720
So, I'm not trying to give
you all the definition,

00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:48.130
dumping the information on you.

00:16:48.130 --> 00:16:52.030
But I like you at least
hearing it once today,

00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:56.000
and then you have more interest,
you can read on the side.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.220
So asset-backed securities
is when you have an asset,

00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:06.150
you basically issue a debt
with the asset backing it.

00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:11.130
And how do you rate
the asset's risk level

00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:14.339
and what's the income
stream, cash flow?

00:17:14.339 --> 00:17:19.089
And before 2008
financial crisis,

00:17:19.089 --> 00:17:25.730
as you heard, large amount
of CMBS-- basically,

00:17:25.730 --> 00:17:29.390
it's a commercial
real estate backed

00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:33.730
securities, mortgage securities,
and the residential, as well.

00:17:33.730 --> 00:17:37.180
And further of all of these,
you heard probably a lot

00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:39.040
about the derivative products.

00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:42.230
So, that started
with swaps, options.

00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:44.460
And the structure
of the products, it

00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:51.320
become more tailor-made for
either investors or borrowers

00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:54.440
to structure the products in
a way to suit their needs.

00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:59.420
And some of the complexity
of those structured products

00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:02.730
become quite high,
and the mathematics

00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:05.950
involved in pricing them
and the risk management

00:18:05.950 --> 00:18:07.380
become rather challenging.

00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:23.050
So coming back to the
players in the market,

00:18:23.050 --> 00:18:25.850
one large type of
player is really bank.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:34.500
Essentially, after 1933
Glass-Steagall legislation,

00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:36.780
there were two main
types of banks.

00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:40.340
One is called commercial bank,
the other is investment bank.

00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:43.690
Commercial bank is
supposedly, you're

00:18:43.690 --> 00:18:46.680
taking deposits and
lend out the money,

00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:51.200
and doing more
commercial services.

00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:55.200
Investment bank supposed to
focus on the capital markets,

00:18:55.200 --> 00:19:00.870
raising capital, trading,
and asset management.

00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:08.140
But obviously, after 1999, the
Glass-Steagall was repealed.

00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:10.040
There's no longer that.

00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:12.300
Some people blame
that, and probably

00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:18.090
for a very good reason, for the
cause of 2008 financial crisis.

00:19:18.090 --> 00:19:22.675
But I want to tell you how
currently investment banks are

00:19:22.675 --> 00:19:23.175
organized.

00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:31.100
Vasily just mentioned he
works in the fixed income.

00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:35.470
So banks typically organized
by institutional business

00:19:35.470 --> 00:19:37.150
and asset management.

00:19:37.150 --> 00:19:40.200
So, within the institutional
client business,

00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:43.590
it has typically
three main parts.

00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:46.540
Fixed income, which
trade the debt

00:19:46.540 --> 00:19:48.990
and the derivative products.

00:19:48.990 --> 00:19:52.850
Equity, trade stocks and
the derivative products.

00:19:52.850 --> 00:19:57.120
And IBD, stands for
Investment Banking Division,

00:19:57.120 --> 00:20:00.240
which really covers
corporate finance,

00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:05.290
raising capital, listing
a stock, IPO, and merger

00:20:05.290 --> 00:20:08.370
and acquisition, and advisory.

00:20:08.370 --> 00:20:11.700
So that's how banks
are organized.

00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:16.640
Outside banks, other players,
basically, the asset managers,

00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:19.935
are obviously a very big force
in the financial markets.

00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:24.120
So the question a
lot of people ask

00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:27.420
is, is this a zero sum game?

00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:30.420
I'm sure you've heard
this many times.

00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:32.900
So, in the financial
markets, some people win,

00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:34.790
some people lose.

00:20:34.790 --> 00:20:38.360
A lot of times, it depends
on the specific products you

00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:40.380
trade, the market you're in.

00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:44.950
It is, lot of times,
pretty net zero.

00:20:44.950 --> 00:20:49.280
But why do we need
financial markets?

00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:53.670
This comes back to what
I described before.

00:20:53.670 --> 00:20:55.920
Because something
existed-- actually,

00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:57.250
there's a need for it.

00:20:57.250 --> 00:21:02.310
It's really the need to
bridge between the lenders

00:21:02.310 --> 00:21:03.930
and the borrowers.

00:21:03.930 --> 00:21:07.770
That's really coming down to
the essential relationship.

00:21:07.770 --> 00:21:10.700
So, investors who
have money need

00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:14.260
to have better yield or better
return, better interest.

00:21:14.260 --> 00:21:18.490
In the current environment,
when you have a savings account,

00:21:18.490 --> 00:21:21.240
you don't really
earn much at all.

00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:26.810
And so you would have to take
more risk to generate more

00:21:26.810 --> 00:21:30.400
return, or you
have longer horizon

00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:34.620
CDs, other type of products,
or trade the stocks.

00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:37.610
So, when somebody has money,
when you trade stocks,

00:21:37.610 --> 00:21:41.210
you're essentially--
you're buying a stock,

00:21:41.210 --> 00:21:43.060
you give the money somewhere.

00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:45.490
Supposedly, it will
go to the company.

00:21:45.490 --> 00:21:50.400
Company use the money to
generate a better return.

00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:54.580
And for the borrowers,
whoever needs money,

00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:58.030
they need to have
access to the capital.

00:21:58.030 --> 00:22:02.000
So obviously, different
borrowers have different risks.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.250
Some people borrow
money, never return.

00:22:04.250 --> 00:22:07.000
So, never generate any
returns, or never even

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:08.690
return the principal.

00:22:08.690 --> 00:22:12.566
And so the trade between
lenders and the borrowers,

00:22:12.566 --> 00:22:15.004
is again, essentially
the main driver

00:22:15.004 --> 00:22:16.045
of the financial markets.

00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:24.580
So, a few more words about
the market participants.

00:22:24.580 --> 00:22:30.240
So, banks and so-called dealers
play the role of market making.

00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:32.020
What is market making?

00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:36.930
So, when you or some end
user go to the market,

00:22:36.930 --> 00:22:41.610
wants to buy or sell,
typically, if there's no market,

00:22:41.610 --> 00:22:43.070
you don't really find the match.

00:22:43.070 --> 00:22:46.130
And some of the products
you want to buy or sell

00:22:46.130 --> 00:22:48.810
may not necessarily be liquid.

00:22:48.810 --> 00:22:53.050
So, the dealers step in the
middle, make you a price.

00:22:53.050 --> 00:22:55.410
Say, OK, you want
to buy or sell.

00:22:55.410 --> 00:23:00.600
I can tell you-- this
stock, I make you price.

00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:08.120
$0.99, and that's my bid.
$0.95, that's my offer.

00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:12.990
So, that's the price I'm
willing to buy or sell.

00:23:12.990 --> 00:23:15.620
But what the result of
the trade-- the dealer

00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:18.140
actually takes the other
side of your trade.

00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:21.840
So, they take principal
risk, in this case.

00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:23.630
So, that's the difference
between dealers

00:23:23.630 --> 00:23:24.860
and the brokers.

00:23:24.860 --> 00:23:28.480
So, brokers don't really
take principal risks.

00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:31.650
If you want to buy
something or sell something,

00:23:31.650 --> 00:23:34.980
if I'm a broker, I
don't make you a price.

00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:37.230
I go to the market makers.

00:23:37.230 --> 00:23:40.960
I actually put two
people together,

00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:43.500
matchmaking, make
that trade happen.

00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:44.940
So, I earn the commission.

00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:47.290
So, that's a broker's role.

00:23:47.290 --> 00:23:49.850
So obviously, there are
individual investors,

00:23:49.850 --> 00:23:52.630
retail investors, same meaning.

00:23:52.630 --> 00:23:57.690
Mutual funds, who actually
manage public investors' money,

00:23:57.690 --> 00:24:02.400
typically in the
long-only format.

00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:04.190
Long means you buy something.

00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:09.870
So, you don't really short
sell a particular security.

00:24:09.870 --> 00:24:12.130
Insurance companies
has large asset.

00:24:12.130 --> 00:24:14.410
They need to generate a
return, generate cash flow

00:24:14.410 --> 00:24:17.010
to meet their liability needs.

00:24:17.010 --> 00:24:18.870
So, they need to invest.

00:24:18.870 --> 00:24:20.990
And the pension
funds, same thing.

00:24:20.990 --> 00:24:22.650
As inflation goes
higher, they need

00:24:22.650 --> 00:24:26.970
to pay out more to the retirees,
so where do you get the return?

00:24:26.970 --> 00:24:29.440
Sovereign wealth fund,
similarly, endowment

00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:32.740
funds-- they all have
this same situation,

00:24:32.740 --> 00:24:36.360
have capital and needs to deploy
and to make better return.

00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:40.750
So this other type of
players, hedge funds.

00:24:40.750 --> 00:24:45.280
So, how many of you
have heard hedge funds?

00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:45.890
OK, good.

00:24:45.890 --> 00:24:48.130
Almost everyone.

00:24:48.130 --> 00:24:51.610
And Peter mentioned that he
used to work at a hedge fund.

00:24:51.610 --> 00:24:55.490
And so, there are
different types

00:24:55.490 --> 00:24:58.290
of strategies, which I
will dive into a bit more,

00:24:58.290 --> 00:25:02.570
but hedge fund play the role
in the market-- they basically

00:25:02.570 --> 00:25:08.380
find opportunities to profit
from inefficient market

00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:13.200
positioning or pricing, so
they have different strategies.

00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:16.790
And the private equity is
different type of funds.

00:25:16.790 --> 00:25:22.190
They basically look
to invest in companies

00:25:22.190 --> 00:25:29.140
and either take them private or
invest in a private equity form

00:25:29.140 --> 00:25:33.130
to hopefully improve the
company's profitability,

00:25:33.130 --> 00:25:35.550
and then catch up.

00:25:35.550 --> 00:25:40.430
And governments obviously have
a huge impact on the market.

00:25:40.430 --> 00:25:45.410
So, we know in the financial
crisis, government intervened.

00:25:45.410 --> 00:25:49.160
And not only that, at the
normal market condition,

00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:52.510
government always have a very
large impact on the market,

00:25:52.510 --> 00:25:54.360
because they are
the policymakers.

00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:57.530
They decide the interest
rate and interest rate curve.

00:25:57.530 --> 00:26:01.500
And the different policies
they push out, obviously,

00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:05.630
will generate different
outlook for the future markets,

00:26:05.630 --> 00:26:07.594
therefore, profitability.

00:26:07.594 --> 00:26:09.510
Then the corporate hedges
and the liabilities.

00:26:09.510 --> 00:26:13.170
When corporates borrow
money, they create some risk,

00:26:13.170 --> 00:26:16.280
so they need to be sensitive
to the market, it changes.

00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:25.230
So, to summarize the
types of trading.

00:26:25.230 --> 00:26:28.560
The first type is
really just hedging.

00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:30.450
That means you're
not proactively

00:26:30.450 --> 00:26:33.080
adding risk to what you have.

00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:34.615
You already have some exposure.

00:26:37.930 --> 00:26:39.202
Just give you an example.

00:26:39.202 --> 00:26:41.160
Let's say you borrow
money, you bought a house,

00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:44.090
so you have mortgage.

00:26:44.090 --> 00:26:51.490
So, let's say it's a floating
rate mortgage payments.

00:26:51.490 --> 00:26:55.210
And you're worried about
interest rates going higher,

00:26:55.210 --> 00:26:59.600
so you can lock that rate in
into the fixed rate format.

00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:03.770
Or you can find ways
to hedge your exposure.

00:27:03.770 --> 00:27:09.170
Or your corporate has a large
income coming from Europe.

00:27:09.170 --> 00:27:12.950
So, you have euros coming
in, but you're not sure

00:27:12.950 --> 00:27:17.410
if euro would trade stronger
to the US dollar in the future,

00:27:17.410 --> 00:27:19.870
or trade weaker.

00:27:19.870 --> 00:27:22.150
If you think it will be
stronger, you just leave it.

00:27:22.150 --> 00:27:25.020
But if you think it
will trade weaker,

00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:26.535
so you may want to
hedge it, meaning

00:27:26.535 --> 00:27:30.790
you want to sell euro
and buy US dollars.

00:27:30.790 --> 00:27:32.560
And so that's the hedging type.

00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:35.650
The second type, as I
mentioned, is a market maker.

00:27:35.650 --> 00:27:38.770
So, market maker also
takes principal risk,

00:27:38.770 --> 00:27:44.190
but the main source of profit
is really to earn the bid offer.

00:27:44.190 --> 00:27:48.300
I gave you the example
$0.90 bid, $0.95 offer.

00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:53.030
So, that's what the market
maker is trying to profit from.

00:27:53.030 --> 00:27:55.620
But obviously, they
have residual risks

00:27:55.620 --> 00:27:56.620
sitting on the book.

00:27:56.620 --> 00:27:59.090
Not every trade is matched.

00:27:59.090 --> 00:28:03.760
So, how to optimize
those group of trades,

00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:06.420
that's what market
maker is doing.

00:28:06.420 --> 00:28:08.900
Most of the bank's
dealers are market makers.

00:28:08.900 --> 00:28:14.290
In the new regulation,
obviously, proprietary trading

00:28:14.290 --> 00:28:18.260
is banned, right?

00:28:18.260 --> 00:28:21.510
And so the third type is
really the proprietary trader,

00:28:21.510 --> 00:28:23.350
the risk taker.

00:28:23.350 --> 00:28:27.020
So, these are the hedge funds
or some portfolio managers.

00:28:27.020 --> 00:28:33.180
They need to focus on generating
return and control the risk.

00:28:33.180 --> 00:28:37.240
So, that's where the beta and
alpha, the concept comes in.

00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:41.455
So, if you're a portfolio
manager, some people say,

00:28:41.455 --> 00:28:42.020
don't worry.

00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:43.360
Don't go pick any stocks.

00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:46.340
Just buy S&P 500 index fund.

00:28:46.340 --> 00:28:47.280
Very cheap.

00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:50.560
You can pay very
little cost to do it.

00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:52.080
That's true.

00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:55.210
But if you want to
beat the S&P 500

00:28:55.210 --> 00:29:03.750
index-- let's assume we call
S&P 500 index fund is asset b.

00:29:03.750 --> 00:29:05.640
So, the return of that, R(b).

00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:08.370
That's a return of that index.

00:29:08.370 --> 00:29:11.868
Now, you have a portfolio a.

00:29:11.868 --> 00:29:16.000
Your time series of
return of your asset a,

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:18.960
obviously, you can
do linear regression.

00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:21.150
A lot of you are
math major here,

00:29:21.150 --> 00:29:26.900
and you can find a correlation
between those two time series.

00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:31.730
So, how the two returns are
related in a simplified form.

00:29:31.730 --> 00:29:35.270
So you can say, this
actually-- somehow it came out.

00:29:35.270 --> 00:29:37.240
It's supposed to
be alpha and beta,

00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:41.950
but it turned out
to be the letters.

00:29:41.950 --> 00:29:45.760
So, in a short description,
beta is really-- just

00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:50.950
think as correlated move
with the other asset.

00:29:50.950 --> 00:29:56.340
Alpha is really the
difference in the return.

00:29:56.340 --> 00:29:57.060
It's a format.

00:29:57.060 --> 00:30:00.640
You want to beat S&P 500,
so you want to basically

00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:02.720
have certain tracking
of this index,

00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:05.038
but you want to return
more on top of that.

00:30:10.750 --> 00:30:13.960
So let me just go
in bit of details

00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:18.000
of how each type of
trade actually occurs.

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:20.030
So, when we talk
about hedging, I

00:30:20.030 --> 00:30:21.460
mentioned the currency example.

00:30:21.460 --> 00:30:23.340
Let me give you another example.

00:30:23.340 --> 00:30:27.270
There are a lot of people
issue bonds, or issue debt.

00:30:27.270 --> 00:30:29.680
So this example I'm
going to give you is,

00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:34.060
let's think about
Australian corporate.

00:30:34.060 --> 00:30:36.620
Because interest
rate in Australia

00:30:36.620 --> 00:30:40.390
is higher than in
Japan, so typically,

00:30:40.390 --> 00:30:44.730
people like to borrow
money in Japan, because you

00:30:44.730 --> 00:30:47.250
pay smaller interest.

00:30:47.250 --> 00:30:49.670
And they invest it in Australia.

00:30:49.670 --> 00:30:54.190
You earn higher interest rate.

00:30:54.190 --> 00:30:57.350
So let me ask you a question.

00:30:57.350 --> 00:30:59.000
Who can tell me,
why don't people

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:02.030
just do that all day long,
just borrow from Japan

00:31:02.030 --> 00:31:05.720
and invest it in Australia?

00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:08.250
Then that interest
rate, I'm giving you

00:31:08.250 --> 00:31:15.030
example of a difference is about
3.5% for the roughly 10 year

00:31:15.030 --> 00:31:17.135
swap rates.

00:31:17.135 --> 00:31:17.760
Yeah, go ahead.

00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:19.900
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:19.900 --> 00:31:21.060
JAKE XIA: Right.

00:31:21.060 --> 00:31:22.800
Because you invest
in the Australia

00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:24.110
Ozzie, Australian dollar.

00:31:24.110 --> 00:31:27.540
The Australian dollar may
become weaker to the yen.

00:31:27.540 --> 00:31:30.860
You may lose all your
profit, or even more.

00:31:30.860 --> 00:31:35.290
And further, if everybody
plays the same game, then

00:31:35.290 --> 00:31:39.510
when you try to exit, you
have the adverse impact

00:31:39.510 --> 00:31:41.050
of your trade.

00:31:41.050 --> 00:31:44.690
So, let's say you think that's
the right time to do it,

00:31:44.690 --> 00:31:47.190
but then at one
time, you wake up,

00:31:47.190 --> 00:31:49.450
you said, huh, I think too
many people are doing this.

00:31:49.450 --> 00:31:50.850
I want to hedge myself.

00:31:50.850 --> 00:31:51.822
So, what do you do?

00:31:51.822 --> 00:31:52.738
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:31:55.047 --> 00:31:55.630
JAKE XIA: Yep.

00:31:55.630 --> 00:31:57.120
So, you try to lock in, right?

00:31:57.120 --> 00:32:00.920
So basically, you sell
the Australian dollars,

00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:02.980
buy the Japanese yen.

00:32:02.980 --> 00:32:04.900
Or on the interest
rate terms, you

00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:09.970
say you'll basically pay the
Australian dollar in the swap

00:32:09.970 --> 00:32:11.850
leg, and receive yen.

00:32:14.940 --> 00:32:19.760
This involves foreign exchange
trade, interest rate swap,

00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:21.860
and the cross-currency swap.

00:32:21.860 --> 00:32:26.130
So, your answer about currency
forward is roughly right,

00:32:26.130 --> 00:32:31.290
but obviously involves a bit
more in actual execution.

00:32:31.290 --> 00:32:32.790
So that's just to
give you example.

00:32:32.790 --> 00:32:35.340
Even if you are
not a finance guy,

00:32:35.340 --> 00:32:39.390
you work in a corporate, you
just do you import, export,

00:32:39.390 --> 00:32:43.440
or building a factory, you
have to know, actually,

00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:44.880
what the exposure is.

00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:49.180
So, risk management, nowadays,
becomes pretty widespread

00:32:49.180 --> 00:32:50.240
responsibility.

00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:55.310
It's not just the corporate
treasury's responsibility.

00:32:55.310 --> 00:32:56.860
So, that's on the hedging side.

00:32:56.860 --> 00:33:01.930
Obviously, if you are
Intel, for example,

00:33:01.930 --> 00:33:05.920
you sell a lot of
chips overseas.

00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:07.660
And your income--
actually, Intel does

00:33:07.660 --> 00:33:11.790
have lot of overseas income
sitting outside the States.

00:33:11.790 --> 00:33:16.570
So, the exposure to them is if
the exchange rate fluctuates,

00:33:16.570 --> 00:33:20.330
dollar becomes a lot stronger,
they actually lose money.

00:33:20.330 --> 00:33:24.590
So, they need to think about how
to hedge the revenue produced

00:33:24.590 --> 00:33:26.660
overseas.

00:33:26.660 --> 00:33:30.080
And obviously, for
import-exporters,

00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:32.250
that's even more apparent.

00:33:32.250 --> 00:33:36.350
And if you're entering
in a merger deal,

00:33:36.350 --> 00:33:38.670
and one company
is buying another,

00:33:38.670 --> 00:33:41.400
you need to hedge your
potential currency

00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:44.250
exposure and your
interest rate exposure.

00:33:44.250 --> 00:33:48.315
And whatever is on the
assets, or the liability,

00:33:48.315 --> 00:33:50.565
or the balance sheet, you
need to hedge your exposure.

00:33:56.080 --> 00:33:58.450
So we talked about
hedging activity.

00:33:58.450 --> 00:34:01.390
Let's talk about market making.

00:34:01.390 --> 00:34:05.010
So if it's a simple
transparent product,

00:34:05.010 --> 00:34:07.320
everybody pretty much
knows where the price is.

00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:10.480
So, if you buy Apple stock,
I think a lot of people

00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:12.179
know pretty much where it is.

00:34:12.179 --> 00:34:15.389
You may even have it
on your cellphone,

00:34:15.389 --> 00:34:18.250
know where that stock is.

00:34:18.250 --> 00:34:21.960
But if it's not transparent,
so what do you do?

00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:24.150
So, if instead of asking
you where Apple is,

00:34:24.150 --> 00:34:26.129
probably you're going
to tell me $495 today.

00:34:26.129 --> 00:34:27.378
AUDIENCE: I don't really know.

00:34:27.378 --> 00:34:28.590
JAKE XIA: OK.

00:34:28.590 --> 00:34:31.870
But if I asked you instead,
what is the call option

00:34:31.870 --> 00:34:37.199
on Apple stock in
two month's time?

00:34:37.199 --> 00:34:40.159
I'll give you a
strike, let's say, 500.

00:34:40.159 --> 00:34:41.790
So you're probably
less transparent.

00:34:41.790 --> 00:34:46.860
So that market maker comes
in to provide that liquidity,

00:34:46.860 --> 00:34:48.440
and then takes the risk.

00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:52.650
They manage the book by
balancing those Greeks, which

00:34:52.650 --> 00:34:53.929
I mentioned earlier.

00:34:53.929 --> 00:34:59.540
Delta, which describes the
[INAUDIBLE] relationship

00:34:59.540 --> 00:35:02.440
of this whole book to the
underlying stock, or underlying

00:35:02.440 --> 00:35:03.700
whatever currency.

00:35:03.700 --> 00:35:05.180
That's called delta.

00:35:05.180 --> 00:35:11.220
Gamma is really the
change of the portfolio.

00:35:11.220 --> 00:35:14.920
Take the derivative
to the delta,

00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:16.490
or to the underlying spot.

00:35:16.490 --> 00:35:20.230
So, that's second-order
derivative.

00:35:20.230 --> 00:35:21.430
Delta is the first order.

00:35:21.430 --> 00:35:27.570
So gamma, now you have curvature
or convexity coming in.

00:35:27.570 --> 00:35:32.180
And theta is really-- nothing
changes in the market.

00:35:32.180 --> 00:35:34.130
Nothing changes
in your position.

00:35:34.130 --> 00:35:39.280
How your trading book is
carrying or bleeding away

00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:40.690
money.

00:35:40.690 --> 00:35:44.120
And we talk about the
volatility exposure was vega.

00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:47.450
And on top of that,
what are the tail risks?

00:35:47.450 --> 00:35:52.030
What are the events can actually
get you into big trouble?

00:35:52.030 --> 00:35:54.330
So people use value at risk.

00:35:54.330 --> 00:35:56.680
So you will hear
this "VaR" concept

00:35:56.680 --> 00:35:59.650
in some of the lectures,
which is also, obviously,

00:35:59.650 --> 00:36:01.150
a very important concept.

00:36:01.150 --> 00:36:03.900
I think Peter will-- or
Choongbum will-- probably

00:36:03.900 --> 00:36:06.340
Peter will teach.

00:36:06.340 --> 00:36:09.570
Then capital.

00:36:09.570 --> 00:36:11.220
How much capital are you using?

00:36:11.220 --> 00:36:13.860
It becomes a very
important issue nowadays.

00:36:13.860 --> 00:36:16.520
And balance sheet.

00:36:16.520 --> 00:36:18.760
Again, you have asset,
you have liability.

00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:19.770
How do you leverage?

00:36:19.770 --> 00:36:21.290
How much leverage you have?

00:36:21.290 --> 00:36:24.140
Before the crisis, for example,
lot of the banks leverage up

00:36:24.140 --> 00:36:29.010
40 times, meaning when you
have $1, you had $40 exposure.

00:36:29.010 --> 00:36:31.360
So when the market moves
little, you get wiped out.

00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:36.530
That's really what amplified
in the 2008 financial crisis.

00:36:36.530 --> 00:36:40.870
And how do you measure
the asset in balance sheet

00:36:40.870 --> 00:36:43.630
when you have derivatives
rather than a straightforward

00:36:43.630 --> 00:36:44.130
notional?

00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:53.370
So lot of quantitative
type of people

00:36:53.370 --> 00:36:56.990
like to focus a bit more
on the risk taking side,

00:36:56.990 --> 00:37:01.120
because people heard stories
about successful cases

00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:03.630
of some hedge funds
using high math.

00:37:03.630 --> 00:37:06.820
They generated very
impressive returns

00:37:06.820 --> 00:37:09.060
and they seem to have an edge.

00:37:09.060 --> 00:37:12.250
So now, people focus
on trading strategies.

00:37:12.250 --> 00:37:17.490
So that falls into the category
of proprietary trading or risk

00:37:17.490 --> 00:37:18.460
taking.

00:37:18.460 --> 00:37:21.300
So that you can just simply
doing directional trading

00:37:21.300 --> 00:37:21.990
strategies.

00:37:21.990 --> 00:37:24.470
Just go long or short the stock.

00:37:24.470 --> 00:37:25.990
That's very simple.

00:37:25.990 --> 00:37:29.530
Those so-called the gut
traders, gut feeling.

00:37:29.530 --> 00:37:30.550
Go with your gut.

00:37:30.550 --> 00:37:31.720
You don't even think.

00:37:31.720 --> 00:37:38.410
You say, I'm eating curry
today, so I go long.

00:37:38.410 --> 00:37:42.310
I'm eating rice
tomorrow, so I go short.

00:37:42.310 --> 00:37:44.400
So, this arbitrage.

00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:50.990
Arbitrage is really to find the
relationships between prices,

00:37:50.990 --> 00:37:56.380
and try to profit from those
relationship mispricing.

00:37:56.380 --> 00:37:59.170
This is actually
very interesting.

00:37:59.170 --> 00:38:01.410
Not many people
focus on arbitrage,

00:38:01.410 --> 00:38:04.320
because lot of people
are gut traders.

00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:06.230
You essentially just
watch your own market.

00:38:06.230 --> 00:38:07.813
You don't really
care what's going on.

00:38:07.813 --> 00:38:13.740
If you trade gold in the
States, the gold price

00:38:13.740 --> 00:38:17.070
happen in Asia and in
Europe matters, right,

00:38:17.070 --> 00:38:18.760
because you're trading
the same thing.

00:38:18.760 --> 00:38:20.520
If they are not
priced the same way,

00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:22.760
you can profit from
the difference.

00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:25.880
And that's just
a simple example.

00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:29.920
But a spot price versus
forward price, that's

00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:31.610
a deterministic relationship.

00:38:31.610 --> 00:38:33.300
It's a mathematical
relationship.

00:38:33.300 --> 00:38:36.050
If that relationship breaks
down, you can also profit.

00:38:36.050 --> 00:38:40.080
So there are many examples
mathematical relationship

00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:44.010
which gives you the
arbitrage opportunity.

00:38:44.010 --> 00:38:47.730
The other type is called a
value trader, or relative

00:38:47.730 --> 00:38:48.850
value strategies.

00:38:51.570 --> 00:38:55.790
Think there's a deterministic,
temporary mathematical

00:38:55.790 --> 00:38:56.900
relationship.

00:38:56.900 --> 00:38:59.190
You look at the longer
term in horizon,

00:38:59.190 --> 00:39:01.610
trying to determine what
is really the underlying

00:39:01.610 --> 00:39:03.910
value of a particular
instrument,

00:39:03.910 --> 00:39:06.820
then trade on the
relative value.

00:39:06.820 --> 00:39:10.950
Obviously, there are successful
value investors out there.

00:39:10.950 --> 00:39:15.500
And the systematic trader
builds computer models.

00:39:15.500 --> 00:39:20.330
One example is trend following,
so just follow the price trend.

00:39:20.330 --> 00:39:25.490
That used to be an effective
strategy for some time,

00:39:25.490 --> 00:39:28.220
but when lot of people
doing the same thing, that

00:39:28.220 --> 00:39:31.750
becomes much less effective.

00:39:31.750 --> 00:39:33.730
Or momentum, same thing.

00:39:33.730 --> 00:39:38.480
Stat arb, finding
statistical relationship

00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:42.490
among large number
of stocks, then

00:39:42.490 --> 00:39:46.430
trade at the higher frequency.

00:39:46.430 --> 00:39:48.470
And fundamental
analysis, you're really

00:39:48.470 --> 00:39:50.890
trying to understand what's
going on in the world.

00:39:50.890 --> 00:39:54.090
What is the trade balance?

00:39:54.090 --> 00:39:58.190
What is the earning
potential of a company?

00:39:58.190 --> 00:40:00.220
What's the trade
balance of a country?

00:40:00.220 --> 00:40:01.830
What is a policy change?

00:40:01.830 --> 00:40:03.760
What does it mean
when Federal Reserve

00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:08.300
announce they're going to
taper the quantitative easing?

00:40:08.300 --> 00:40:12.890
Why the stock market is sold
off in the last couple months,

00:40:12.890 --> 00:40:17.100
especially why stocks in
India, Brazil, Indonesia,

00:40:17.100 --> 00:40:18.590
sold out more.

00:40:18.590 --> 00:40:19.490
Why is that?

00:40:19.490 --> 00:40:22.850
So it goes through those
fundamental analysis.

00:40:22.850 --> 00:40:25.770
And there are
special situations.

00:40:25.770 --> 00:40:31.500
Some companies are going
through particular difficulties,

00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:33.610
assets are priced very cheaply.

00:40:33.610 --> 00:40:39.290
So, there are firms out there --
you probably heard Bain Capital

00:40:39.290 --> 00:40:42.740
and many others -- where they
focus on these private equity

00:40:42.740 --> 00:40:45.085
and special situation
opportunities.

00:40:49.550 --> 00:40:55.690
So what have all of these
to do with mathematics?

00:40:55.690 --> 00:40:58.080
Where does math come in?

00:40:58.080 --> 00:40:59.650
How do you use math?

00:40:59.650 --> 00:41:02.890
So, I want to give you
some aspects of that.

00:41:02.890 --> 00:41:07.300
So from my personal experience,
I joined the market,

00:41:07.300 --> 00:41:09.980
really start to working
on pricing models.

00:41:09.980 --> 00:41:11.500
So, that's the first area.

00:41:11.500 --> 00:41:14.160
So, math is very
effective, because when

00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:19.060
you, your bank,
your corporate, you

00:41:19.060 --> 00:41:21.830
want to buy some
financial instruments,

00:41:21.830 --> 00:41:25.540
you have to know
where is the price.

00:41:25.540 --> 00:41:28.400
It's easy to observe
a stock in the market,

00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:31.470
but when it comes to
more complex products,

00:41:31.470 --> 00:41:35.350
they just take one step
forward on the complexity,

00:41:35.350 --> 00:41:36.720
which is the option.

00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:38.490
You have to know how
to price an option.

00:41:38.490 --> 00:41:40.660
So, that's where
the math comes in.

00:41:40.660 --> 00:41:43.450
You actually have to be able
to solve differential equations

00:41:43.450 --> 00:41:47.270
to get a model price,
then you obviously

00:41:47.270 --> 00:41:51.640
adjust to your assumptions
to fit into the market.

00:41:51.640 --> 00:41:57.660
So, pricing model, which Vasily
and many of his colleagues

00:41:57.660 --> 00:42:00.690
can tell you more--
which is very much

00:42:00.690 --> 00:42:03.290
a very interesting
and challenging area.

00:42:03.290 --> 00:42:06.050
How do you price all
these instruments?

00:42:06.050 --> 00:42:09.375
And when I say pricing, it's
not in the narrow definition

00:42:09.375 --> 00:42:11.380
of just coming up
with the price.

00:42:11.380 --> 00:42:13.140
When you build a
pricing model, you also

00:42:13.140 --> 00:42:18.220
generate the risk parameters
of these instruments,

00:42:18.220 --> 00:42:21.020
and how do you risk manage them.

00:42:21.020 --> 00:42:23.010
So, that comes to
the second part.

00:42:23.010 --> 00:42:26.840
So math is very useful
in risk management,

00:42:26.840 --> 00:42:29.600
which I will give you
some -- not quiz --

00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:31.920
questions after this slide.

00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:35.610
You can see that risk management
itself is very challenging.

00:42:35.610 --> 00:42:37.460
It's not a purely
mathematical question,

00:42:37.460 --> 00:42:40.140
but yet, math plays
a very important role

00:42:40.140 --> 00:42:44.050
to quantify how much
exposure you have.

00:42:44.050 --> 00:42:47.010
Then, the third is
trading strategies.

00:42:47.010 --> 00:42:50.630
Again, I think a lot of
people with math background,

00:42:50.630 --> 00:42:52.660
or in general,
people are looking

00:42:52.660 --> 00:42:57.170
for the so-called holy
grail trading strategies.

00:42:57.170 --> 00:43:00.330
It's almost like perpetual
motion machines people

00:43:00.330 --> 00:43:02.005
looking for 100 years ago.

00:43:02.005 --> 00:43:03.570
You just turn it on.

00:43:03.570 --> 00:43:05.660
It makes money by itself.

00:43:05.660 --> 00:43:08.350
You go to sleep, you go on
vacation, you come back,

00:43:08.350 --> 00:43:10.760
you'll have more in
your bank account.

00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:13.560
Obviously, that's
not going to happen.

00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:20.040
The robotrader, a robotic
trader, is a dream.

00:43:20.040 --> 00:43:26.350
It has its place or its use,
but it's a fast evolving market.

00:43:26.350 --> 00:43:31.440
You have to constantly
either upgrade your research

00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:34.460
and adjust your strategies.

00:43:34.460 --> 00:43:38.380
There's no such thing you
can build and leave it alone,

00:43:38.380 --> 00:43:40.480
it runs for itself forever.

00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:45.030
But I just want to
mention that because maybe

00:43:45.030 --> 00:43:47.100
towards the end of the
term you will feel, hmm,

00:43:47.100 --> 00:43:50.280
I came up with this
brilliant trading strategy.

00:43:50.280 --> 00:43:52.240
I think it's going to
make money forever.

00:43:52.240 --> 00:43:55.785
Please let me know first.

00:43:55.785 --> 00:43:59.260
AUDIENCE: And me second.

00:43:59.260 --> 00:44:04.700
PROFESSOR: So, I want to
leave some time to Vasily.

00:44:04.700 --> 00:44:07.420
Actually, he can give
you some examples

00:44:07.420 --> 00:44:10.400
of projects of last
year's students

00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:16.030
who actually came to this class
and did some real application

00:44:16.030 --> 00:44:17.390
at Morgan Stanley.

00:44:17.390 --> 00:44:20.120
But before I hand
it over to Vasily,

00:44:20.120 --> 00:44:22.050
let me ask you some questions.

00:44:22.050 --> 00:44:25.060
I just want to-- not really
to quiz you, just give you

00:44:25.060 --> 00:44:30.490
the sense how math and
intuition and judgment

00:44:30.490 --> 00:44:32.330
can come into the same place.

00:44:32.330 --> 00:44:35.820
So, let me first give you an
example I call risk aversion.

00:44:35.820 --> 00:44:41.306
So, you are facing two choices,
choice A and a choice B. Choice

00:44:41.306 --> 00:44:45.540
A being you have 80
chance to lose $500.

00:44:45.540 --> 00:44:50.696
You have 20% chance to win $500.

00:44:50.696 --> 00:44:51.820
That's pretty clear, right?

00:44:51.820 --> 00:44:56.780
That's choice A. Or
choice B, you basically

00:44:56.780 --> 00:45:01.960
just lock in you have
100% chance to lose $280.

00:45:01.960 --> 00:45:08.850
Let me ask you, for whoever
likes to choose choice A,

00:45:08.850 --> 00:45:10.154
please raise your hand.

00:45:15.024 --> 00:45:16.980
One, two, three, four.

00:45:16.980 --> 00:45:22.280
About six out of say,
let's call it 50.

00:45:22.280 --> 00:45:25.733
So, can I ask you why you
think choice A makes sense?

00:45:25.733 --> 00:45:27.774
AUDIENCE: So, I know it's
a lower expected value,

00:45:27.774 --> 00:45:35.370
but I enjoy gambling and I would
rather take the chance of--

00:45:35.370 --> 00:45:39.080
JAKE XIA: Right, because you
don't want to lock in that $280

00:45:39.080 --> 00:45:39.900
loss, right?

00:45:39.900 --> 00:45:41.740
That, or you still
have 20% chance to win.

00:45:44.380 --> 00:45:46.250
For the ones raised
their hand for choice A,

00:45:46.250 --> 00:45:48.190
are there any other reasons?

00:45:48.190 --> 00:45:48.910
Same reason.

00:45:51.285 --> 00:45:52.160
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:45:56.280 --> 00:45:57.770
JAKE XIA: I assume
the rest of you

00:45:57.770 --> 00:46:00.840
would choose choice B,
unless you-- Neither?

00:46:00.840 --> 00:46:02.600
How many of you choose choice B?

00:46:06.410 --> 00:46:10.040
Choice B. And are there
anybody think neither is right?

00:46:12.770 --> 00:46:15.000
You have to choose.

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:16.590
No, you have to choose.

00:46:16.590 --> 00:46:19.520
So, either choice A or choice B.

00:46:19.520 --> 00:46:22.320
So, let me just talk a
little bit about this.

00:46:22.320 --> 00:46:24.880
Again, I'm not trying to
tell you which one is right,

00:46:24.880 --> 00:46:27.840
but I just share my thoughts
how we look at these.

00:46:27.840 --> 00:46:29.450
Why it called risk aversion?

00:46:29.450 --> 00:46:33.260
So, this is very
common human behavior.

00:46:33.260 --> 00:46:36.580
When you go to the
market, you buy a stock.

00:46:36.580 --> 00:46:40.050
When the stock goes
up, makes bit of money,

00:46:40.050 --> 00:46:44.590
the natural tendency -- for
especially someone is new

00:46:44.590 --> 00:46:47.565
to the market -- is
to let's take profit.

00:46:47.565 --> 00:46:48.290
Let's sell.

00:46:48.290 --> 00:46:49.670
Oh, I made $1000.

00:46:49.670 --> 00:46:51.170
I made $500.

00:46:51.170 --> 00:46:54.930
Let's go have a nice
meal or whatever.

00:46:54.930 --> 00:46:58.410
Buy an iPad.

00:46:58.410 --> 00:47:02.456
But when the stock loses money,
what's the natural tendency?

00:47:02.456 --> 00:47:04.910
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:04.910 --> 00:47:05.660
JAKE XIA: That's--

00:47:05.660 --> 00:47:06.990
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:06.990 --> 00:47:08.390
JAKE XIA: I think natural
tendency, lot of people

00:47:08.390 --> 00:47:09.060
will keep it.

00:47:09.060 --> 00:47:11.580
I think if you have the
discipline to get out,

00:47:11.580 --> 00:47:14.030
that's great.

00:47:14.030 --> 00:47:18.460
Trading is really all about
how do you risk manage,

00:47:18.460 --> 00:47:22.375
have the discipline, and
how to manage your losses.

00:47:22.375 --> 00:47:24.000
The natural tendency
of a lot of people

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:26.980
is, well, I think there's
a 20% chance to come back,

00:47:26.980 --> 00:47:29.490
and I'm going to make $500 more.

00:47:29.490 --> 00:47:34.330
Why do I want to lock in
to stop myself out at 280?

00:47:34.330 --> 00:47:38.960
So even though the expected
value-- I think lot of people

00:47:38.960 --> 00:47:44.510
said, you lose expected value,
which is $300 in choice A,

00:47:44.510 --> 00:47:49.580
but you would still
not to choose choice B,

00:47:49.580 --> 00:47:52.300
because you don't want
to lock in the $280 loss.

00:47:52.300 --> 00:47:57.900
Again, I'm not trying to inject
the idea to you of which one

00:47:57.900 --> 00:48:00.260
is right or wrong,
but think about it.

00:48:00.260 --> 00:48:05.360
So, that's really the common
behavior, which mathematically

00:48:05.360 --> 00:48:10.270
may not make sense, but lot of
people still would like to do.

00:48:10.270 --> 00:48:14.020
And also, really, when
you think about it,

00:48:14.020 --> 00:48:16.120
depends on your situation.

00:48:16.120 --> 00:48:23.320
And let's say, you
think the market--

00:48:23.320 --> 00:48:26.030
I'm giving you the
stock example again.

00:48:26.030 --> 00:48:29.240
If you're not purely following
the discipline of stop loss,

00:48:29.240 --> 00:48:32.150
but you just think the
fundamental picture

00:48:32.150 --> 00:48:33.090
has changed.

00:48:33.090 --> 00:48:36.350
You really don't think the
stock should go up anymore.

00:48:36.350 --> 00:48:40.530
Obviously, at whatever level
you should get out, regardless

00:48:40.530 --> 00:48:41.820
how much loss you lock in.

00:48:44.420 --> 00:48:47.280
But if you think the fundamental
story is still very sound,

00:48:47.280 --> 00:48:51.010
you should think about as if
you don't have a position, what

00:48:51.010 --> 00:48:52.660
you want to do next.

00:48:52.660 --> 00:48:54.830
But anyway,
mathematically, I just

00:48:54.830 --> 00:48:59.670
want to see-- I
guess this is MIT,

00:48:59.670 --> 00:49:02.450
so many people
think mathematically

00:49:02.450 --> 00:49:07.140
where you would actually
choose choice B, because that's

00:49:07.140 --> 00:49:08.740
low expectation,
which makes sense.

00:49:08.740 --> 00:49:12.300
But I think if you
ask a larger audience,

00:49:12.300 --> 00:49:15.687
I think a lot of people don't
really want to choose choice B,

00:49:15.687 --> 00:49:17.520
because they don't want
to lock in the loss.

00:49:21.030 --> 00:49:24.820
Now, let me change the
question a little bit.

00:49:24.820 --> 00:49:29.590
So, choice A becomes instead
of the 80% chance to lose,

00:49:29.590 --> 00:49:34.690
now you have 80% chance
to win $500 and 20% chance

00:49:34.690 --> 00:49:37.130
to lose $500.

00:49:37.130 --> 00:49:43.240
Choice B, you have 100%
chance to win $280.

00:49:43.240 --> 00:49:44.560
Who would choose choice A?

00:49:48.060 --> 00:49:50.510
Again, minority
of this audience.

00:49:50.510 --> 00:49:52.480
Let's say less than 10%.

00:49:52.480 --> 00:49:54.700
Who would choose choice B?

00:49:54.700 --> 00:49:56.370
The rest of you.

00:49:56.370 --> 00:49:59.120
All right.

00:49:59.120 --> 00:50:04.519
Can someone choose choice A give
me an argument why would you?

00:50:04.519 --> 00:50:05.394
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:50:15.090 --> 00:50:15.980
JAKE XIA: Yep.

00:50:15.980 --> 00:50:18.320
Anyone want to give me
a reason for choice B?

00:50:18.320 --> 00:50:20.670
AUDIENCE: Higher Sharpe.

00:50:20.670 --> 00:50:22.136
JAKE XIA: Higher Sharpe?

00:50:22.136 --> 00:50:22.950
Mm-hm.

00:50:22.950 --> 00:50:25.530
Yup.

00:50:25.530 --> 00:50:28.170
Well, let me just leave it here.

00:50:28.170 --> 00:50:33.154
Again, I think we can talk a
bit more along in the class.

00:50:33.154 --> 00:50:34.570
I mean, the last
day of the class,

00:50:34.570 --> 00:50:38.890
hopefully we'll have much
deeper discussion on this.

00:50:38.890 --> 00:50:39.840
It's not unique.

00:50:39.840 --> 00:50:44.190
The answer, I think it can go
you either way, as you said.

00:50:44.190 --> 00:50:47.920
If your bank account
balance is-- let's

00:50:47.920 --> 00:50:50.010
say you are a freshman student.

00:50:50.010 --> 00:50:54.810
Your bank account is $800.

00:50:54.810 --> 00:50:58.000
Your choice will be very
different from someone has

00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:01.690
$100,000 in his bank account.

00:51:01.690 --> 00:51:11.181
And also, your risk tolerance,
how much you can tolerate.

00:51:11.181 --> 00:51:13.430
I'm not going to give you
say, this is right or wrong.

00:51:13.430 --> 00:51:17.715
But with that, let me move on
and give you some homework.

00:51:23.350 --> 00:51:25.090
So, before I give
you the homework,

00:51:25.090 --> 00:51:27.840
I want to make a
few more comments.

00:51:27.840 --> 00:51:30.620
Do people always learn
from their experiences?

00:51:30.620 --> 00:51:35.480
In science, we collect
evidence, we build models.

00:51:35.480 --> 00:51:36.860
We first understand the physics.

00:51:36.860 --> 00:51:40.460
We build mathematical models,
then we verify in physics,

00:51:40.460 --> 00:51:41.900
doing experiments.

00:51:41.900 --> 00:51:45.392
But is that the same
investigation process

00:51:45.392 --> 00:51:48.270
in finance?

00:51:48.270 --> 00:51:50.890
Market cycles are
typically very long,

00:51:50.890 --> 00:51:53.720
but people tend to
have short memories.

00:51:53.720 --> 00:51:56.160
So, how do people really
learn from their experiences?

00:51:56.160 --> 00:51:57.870
A very interesting question.

00:51:57.870 --> 00:52:01.720
And very natural tendency
is to extrapolate

00:52:01.720 --> 00:52:03.430
historical experience.

00:52:03.430 --> 00:52:04.940
What happened in 2008?

00:52:04.940 --> 00:52:06.460
People still remember.

00:52:06.460 --> 00:52:09.890
What happened in 1970s?

00:52:09.890 --> 00:52:11.370
Maybe some people
still remember.

00:52:11.370 --> 00:52:13.940
What happened 100 years ago?

00:52:13.940 --> 00:52:17.930
So, people tend to extrapolate,
drawing conclusions

00:52:17.930 --> 00:52:20.440
from very recent experience.

00:52:20.440 --> 00:52:24.950
And deterministic relationship
versus statistical relationship

00:52:24.950 --> 00:52:27.010
is very interesting, as well.

00:52:27.010 --> 00:52:31.344
When you try to trade on those,
how do you really build models?

00:52:31.344 --> 00:52:32.635
Is the market really efficient?

00:52:35.890 --> 00:52:37.660
What part is efficient?

00:52:37.660 --> 00:52:40.090
How do you really
apply those theories

00:52:40.090 --> 00:52:43.800
in your day-to-day risk
management or trading

00:52:43.800 --> 00:52:45.470
activities?

00:52:45.470 --> 00:52:49.410
And sometimes, people
tend to oversimplify.

00:52:49.410 --> 00:52:51.640
Just say, oh, I can model this.

00:52:51.640 --> 00:52:54.030
This is one important parameter.

00:52:54.030 --> 00:52:55.450
I just take that.

00:52:55.450 --> 00:52:57.130
So I just give you
all the warnings

00:52:57.130 --> 00:53:02.220
that the-- again,
very young, new field

00:53:02.220 --> 00:53:07.550
and largely, often, this
is art, than science.

00:53:07.550 --> 00:53:09.700
So keep that in mind,
even though we're talking

00:53:09.700 --> 00:53:12.290
about mathematics in finance.

00:53:12.290 --> 00:53:15.980
Math is very powerful
and useful in finance.

00:53:15.980 --> 00:53:18.700
So learn the math,
learn the finance first,

00:53:18.700 --> 00:53:21.550
but keep those
questions along the way

00:53:21.550 --> 00:53:23.570
when you are learning
during this class.

00:53:27.130 --> 00:53:29.055
So suggested homework, optional.

00:53:32.150 --> 00:53:35.780
I mentioned a lot of
terminologies today.

00:53:35.780 --> 00:53:39.360
Go to the course website,
read what we have put up

00:53:39.360 --> 00:53:41.420
for the financial glossary.

00:53:41.420 --> 00:53:45.110
So if you still have things
you don't understand,

00:53:45.110 --> 00:53:49.430
compile your own list of
financial concepts, which

00:53:49.430 --> 00:53:53.300
you can search on the
web or even ask us.

00:53:53.300 --> 00:53:54.920
But I encourage you to do that.

00:53:54.920 --> 00:53:56.730
It will prepare you well.

00:53:56.730 --> 00:53:59.940
So, that's really-- and
read other materials

00:53:59.940 --> 00:54:01.950
on the course work.

00:54:01.950 --> 00:54:04.740
So we got maybe--
how about this?

00:54:04.740 --> 00:54:08.290
We still got about 15
minutes or 12 minutes left,

00:54:08.290 --> 00:54:11.080
so I'll pass it to
Vasily, then maybe we

00:54:11.080 --> 00:54:12.930
can leave five minutes
for some questions.

00:54:12.930 --> 00:54:13.763
VASILY STRELA: Yeah.

00:54:13.763 --> 00:54:15.150
JAKE XIA: Yeah, OK.

00:54:15.150 --> 00:54:16.650
VASILY STRELA:
[INAUDIBLE] mentioned

00:54:16.650 --> 00:54:30.485
that, Apple trades, that now
it's $494.4 Yeah, just a couple

00:54:30.485 --> 00:54:31.110
of [INAUDIBLE].

00:54:31.110 --> 00:54:42.552
Well, first of all, no offense
to people who were [INAUDIBLE],

00:54:42.552 --> 00:54:47.644
but I just wanted to give
an example of [INAUDIBLE].

00:54:51.102 --> 00:54:52.018
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:55:01.760 --> 00:55:04.150
VASILY STRELA: --because he
was working in our group,

00:55:04.150 --> 00:55:11.080
and it just will give you a
little bit of an idea what

00:55:11.080 --> 00:55:13.130
we will be talking about
and what actually we

00:55:13.130 --> 00:55:18.160
do in the daily life, or what
an intern or somebody who

00:55:18.160 --> 00:55:22.150
comes to work in this
industry could do.

00:55:22.150 --> 00:55:26.790
And one project is
[INAUDIBLE] worked

00:55:26.790 --> 00:55:31.470
was on estimating
the noisy derivative.

00:55:31.470 --> 00:55:33.150
Derivative is called delta.

00:55:33.150 --> 00:55:36.040
Delta is usually the first
derivative to a function.

00:55:36.040 --> 00:55:42.140
And as we will see in the class,
quite often, to obtain a price,

00:55:42.140 --> 00:55:45.870
you do it through Monte Carlo,
meaning running a lot of paths

00:55:45.870 --> 00:55:48.950
and then averaging along them.

00:55:48.950 --> 00:55:50.200
So, it's a statistical method.

00:55:50.200 --> 00:55:56.320
So obviously, there is a noise
to your answer every time.

00:55:56.320 --> 00:56:01.560
So, if you want to
differentiate this functions

00:56:01.560 --> 00:56:06.910
and get a derivative, then this
derivative will be quite noisy.

00:56:06.910 --> 00:56:10.240
And so, instead of getting
the true derivative,

00:56:10.240 --> 00:56:14.290
you might obtain something quite
different from true derivative

00:56:14.290 --> 00:56:16.490
just because there
is a confidence

00:56:16.490 --> 00:56:19.580
interval around any point.

00:56:19.580 --> 00:56:22.420
And obviously, there is a
trade off here, as well,

00:56:22.420 --> 00:56:28.950
because you can run more paths,
throw more computational power,

00:56:28.950 --> 00:56:31.920
which will reduce your
confidence interval.

00:56:31.920 --> 00:56:37.890
You will know better where
you are, more precise.

00:56:37.890 --> 00:56:42.390
Or the other solution
could be, if you

00:56:42.390 --> 00:56:45.710
know that your function is
not too concave and reasonably

00:56:45.710 --> 00:56:52.070
flat, you might do the
numerical differentiation

00:56:52.070 --> 00:56:53.760
on wider interval.

00:56:53.760 --> 00:56:56.995
Basically, reducing the
significance of the error,

00:56:56.995 --> 00:57:00.770
and you will hope to arrive
to a better approximation.

00:57:00.770 --> 00:57:05.790
So obviously, there is somewhere
balance, and the question was,

00:57:05.790 --> 00:57:13.270
is there an optimal shift
size to get the derivative?

00:57:13.270 --> 00:57:20.010
And that's what-- uh oh,
the slide got corrupted.

00:57:20.010 --> 00:57:23.170
So, there was quite
a bit of mathematics

00:57:23.170 --> 00:57:26.560
involved and minimization
and optimization.

00:57:26.560 --> 00:57:27.470
There was an answer.

00:57:27.470 --> 00:57:35.440
And that's actually what
we finally arrived at.

00:57:35.440 --> 00:57:38.900
And that's some toy
example, but still, it

00:57:38.900 --> 00:57:41.600
shows you that if
you use constant size

00:57:41.600 --> 00:57:45.890
and not optimal size, that would
be your numerical derivative

00:57:45.890 --> 00:57:49.770
of this blue function.

00:57:49.770 --> 00:57:51.750
While if you use
an optimal shift

00:57:51.750 --> 00:57:54.000
size, which
[INAUDIBLE] computed,

00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:57.370
it would be much
smoother and much better.

00:57:57.370 --> 00:58:01.130
So, that's one of example,
and that's what he did.

00:58:01.130 --> 00:58:05.580
And we actually are implementing
it in our systems and plan

00:58:05.580 --> 00:58:09.670
to use it in practice.

00:58:09.670 --> 00:58:14.470
Another project was
actually quite different.

00:58:14.470 --> 00:58:17.530
And it was about
electronic trading

00:58:17.530 --> 00:58:27.690
and basically how to better
predict prices of currencies

00:58:27.690 --> 00:58:29.220
and exchange rate.

00:58:29.220 --> 00:58:32.980
And funny enough, it
was on ruble/US dollar,

00:58:32.980 --> 00:58:38.360
because it was actually
aimed for our Moscow office.

00:58:38.360 --> 00:58:42.150
And basically, what we had,
we had the noisy observation

00:58:42.150 --> 00:58:46.790
of broker data and
it was coming out

00:58:46.790 --> 00:58:50.280
at different non-uniform times.

00:58:50.280 --> 00:58:52.160
Basically, at random times.

00:58:52.160 --> 00:58:57.230
So, we decided to
use Kalman filter

00:58:57.230 --> 00:59:01.100
and to study how it can predict.

00:59:01.100 --> 00:59:07.880
And that's one of the
nice graphs [INAUDIBLE]

00:59:07.880 --> 00:59:13.580
produced, which again,
we will use this strategy

00:59:13.580 --> 00:59:17.870
and the Kalman filters
which he constructed

00:59:17.870 --> 00:59:23.920
in our e-trading
platform in Moscow.

00:59:23.920 --> 00:59:27.120
So, that's just a
couple of examples,

00:59:27.120 --> 00:59:30.605
which I wanted to give you
as a preview of what we

00:59:30.605 --> 00:59:33.980
will be talking in the class.

00:59:33.980 --> 00:59:38.850
Just to remind, the website
is fully functional.

00:59:38.850 --> 00:59:44.080
We put syllabus there, a
short list of literature.

00:59:44.080 --> 00:59:47.750
We will be posting a
lot of materials there.

00:59:47.750 --> 00:59:51.120
Probably most lectures
will be published there.

00:59:51.120 --> 00:59:54.480
Jake's slides are there already.

00:59:54.480 --> 00:59:56.340
So, any questions?

00:59:59.650 --> 01:00:03.770
JAKE XIA: Please hand
back the sign up sheets.

01:00:03.770 --> 01:00:07.390
We like to get your
emails so we can put you

01:00:07.390 --> 01:00:10.264
on the website for
further announcements,

01:00:10.264 --> 01:00:13.930
but you can also add
yourselves. [INAUDIBLE].

01:00:13.930 --> 01:00:16.490
But it's probably easier
if you put your email

01:00:16.490 --> 01:00:19.839
on the sign up sheet,
so we can [INAUDIBLE].

01:00:19.839 --> 01:00:21.380
VASILY STRELA: Yeah,
but please visit

01:00:21.380 --> 01:00:23.755
and sign up here,
because there will

01:00:23.755 --> 01:00:25.005
be announcements to the class.

01:00:27.750 --> 01:00:29.700
Thank you very much.

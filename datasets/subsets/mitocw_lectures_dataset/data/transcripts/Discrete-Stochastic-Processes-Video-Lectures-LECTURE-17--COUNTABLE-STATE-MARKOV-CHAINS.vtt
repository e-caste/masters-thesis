00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:22.730
PROFESSOR: OK, so let's
get started.

00:00:26.335 --> 00:00:30.230
I want to talk mostly about
countable state Markov chains

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:35.790
today, which is the new topic
we started on Wednesday.

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:41.360
I want to talk just a little bit
about the strong law proof

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.260
that was in the third
problem of the quiz.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:49.040
I'm not doing that because
none of you understood

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:50.050
anything about it.

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.660
I'm doing it because all of you
understood more about it

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.680
than I thought you would.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.350
And in fact, I've always avoided
saying too much about

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:04.010
this proof because I thought
everybody was tuning them out.

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.710
And for the class here, it looks
like a lot of you have

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.870
tried seriously to understand
these things.

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:15.090
So I thought I would explain
that one part of the quiz in

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.450
detail so that you'd see the
parts you're missing, and so

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.110
that [INAUDIBLE] all these other
proofs that we have,

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.730
talking about the strong law
and the strong law for

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:27.250
renewals, and putting them
together and all of these

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.710
things, all of them are
essentially the same.

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.070
And it's just a matter
of figuring out

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:35.580
how things fit together.

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:43.090
So I wanted to talk about that
because it's clear that most

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.560
of you understand enough about
it that it makes sense.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.420
The situation in the quiz, which
is very close to the

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:56.190
usual queuing situation and
little theorem type things,

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:58.690
there's a sequence
of Y sub i's.

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:00.320
They're IID.

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:06.120
There's the service times for
G/G infinity queue, and n of

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.710
t, which is a renewal
process for the

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:10.250
arrivals to the process.

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.070
We have arrivals coming in
according to this renewal

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:17.840
process, which means the
[INAUDIBLE] arrival times, X

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.680
sub i, were IID.

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.450
And we want to put those
two things together.

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:31.250
And we want to find out
what this limit is.

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.190
If it's a limit, show
that it's a limit.

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.490
And hopefully show that it's
a limit with probability 1.

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:45.500
And I think a large number of
you basically realize that

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.750
this argument consisted
of a bunch of steps.

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.400
Some people with more
detail than others.

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.850
But the first step, which we do
in all of these arguments,

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:03.010
is to divide and multiply
by n of t of omega.

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.010
So we're starting out, looking
at some particular sample

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:11.670
path, and start out by
multiplying and dividing by n

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.390
of t of omega.

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:18.640
The next thing is to claim that
the limit of this times

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:24.680
this is equal to the limit of
this times the limit of this.

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.460
Almost no one recognized that as
a real problem, and that is

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:30.840
a real problem.

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.440
It's probably the least
obvious thing

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:39.080
in this whole problem.

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.540
I'm not saying you shouldn't
have done that, because I've

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.220
been doing that in all
the proofs I've been

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.500
giving you all along.

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.500
It is sort of obvious
that that works.

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:53.120
And when you're constructing a
proof, especially in a quiz

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.440
when you don't have much time,
things which are almost

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.300
obvious or which look obvious,
you should just go ahead and

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:03.270
assume them and come back later
when you have time to

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:05.860
see whether that really
makes sense.

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:08.450
That's the way you
do research also.

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:12.240
You don't do research by
painstakingly establishing

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.740
every point in some
linear path.

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:22.320
What you do is you carelessly
as you can and with as much

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.290
insight as you can, you jump
all the way to the end, you

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:29.310
see where you're trying to go,
you see how to get there, and

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:32.280
then you come back and you try
to figure out what each

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.880
of the steps are.

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:38.320
So this is certainly a very
reasonable way of solving this

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:42.250
problem, because it looks like
this limit should be equal to

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:44.340
this limit times this limit.

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:50.520
The next step in the argument is
to claim that this sum, up

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:54.850
to N of t of omega, over
N of t of omega, as

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:56.220
t approaches infinity--

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:59.290
the argument is that t
approaches infinity--

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:04.500
this N of t of omega goes
through, one by one, a

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:08.250
sequence, 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, and so forth.

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:12.320
So this limit is equal
to that limit.

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:15.100
I've never been able to figure
out whether that's obvious or

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:17.200
not obvious.

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:20.390
It is just on the borderline
between what's obvious and not

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:23.430
obvious, so I'm gonna
prove it to you.

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:29.470
And then the next step is to see
that N of t of omega over

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:35.260
t is equal to 1/X-bar
with probability 1.

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:40.190
And this limit is equal to
Y-bar with probability 1.

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:45.770
The first argument, this equal
to 1/X-bar is because of the

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:47.850
strong law with renewals.

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:51.010
And this one over here is
because of the strong law of

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:52.000
large numbers.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.230
And most of you managed
to get this.

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:57.200
And the whole argument assumes
that X-bar is less than

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:00.730
infinity, and Y-bar is
less than infinity.

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:03.720
Now, how do you go back and
actually see that this

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:04.900
actually makes sense?

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:07.940
And that's what I
want to do next.

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:13.720
And if you look at this, you
can't do it by starting here

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:17.220
and working your way down to
there, because there's no way

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:20.620
you're going to argue that this
limit is equal to this

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:24.200
product of limit unless you know
something about this and

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:25.960
you know something about this.

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:28.340
So you really have to establish
that these things

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:31.020
have limits first before
you can go back

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:32.080
and establish this.

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:35.890
In the same way, you have to
know something about this

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:37.780
before you can establish this.

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:40.840
So what you have to do way after
you've managed to have

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:44.400
the insight to jump the whole
way through this thing, is to

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:48.890
go back and argue each of the
points, but argue them in

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:50.465
reverse order.

00:06:50.465 --> 00:06:53.990
And that's very often the way
you do research, and it's

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:56.610
certainly the way
you do quizzes.

00:06:56.610 --> 00:07:02.750
So let's see where those
arguments were.

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:07.670
Start out by letting A1 be the
set of omega for which this

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:14.670
limit here, N of t of omega over
t, is equal to 1/X-bar.

00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:18.060
By the strong law for renewal
processes, the probability of

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:21.000
A1 equals 1.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.200
This is stating this in a little
cleaner way, I think,

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:28.000
than we stated the strong law
of renewals originally,

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.120
because we started out by
tumbling together this

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:34.660
statement and this statement.

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:38.190
I think it's cleaner to say,
start out, there's a set of

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:41.700
omega 1 for which this
limit exists.

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:45.540
And what the strong law says is
that that set of omega has

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:47.000
probability 1.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.710
And now we have some terminology
for A1, what it

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:51.210
actually means.

00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:53.830
It is the set of omega
for which this works.

00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:56.510
You never have it working
for all omega,

00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:58.800
only for some omega.

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:03.730
Then the next step, let A2 be
the set of omega for which the

00:08:03.730 --> 00:08:09.400
limit is n goes to infinity of
1/n times the sum of Y sub i

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:12.340
of omega, is equal to Y-bar.

00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:18.010
By the strong law of large
numbers, the probability of A2

00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:19.260
is equal to 1.

00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:26.180
So now we've established there's
an A1, there's an A2.

00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:28.390
Each of them have
probability 1.

00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:30.170
On A1, one limit exists.

00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:32.240
On A2, the other limit exists.

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:34.960
And we have two sets, both
at probability 1.

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:37.799
What's the probability of the
intersection of them?

00:08:37.799 --> 00:08:40.909
It has to be 1 also.

00:08:40.909 --> 00:08:45.570
So with that, you know that
equation three is equal to

00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:49.560
equation four for omega
in the sets, A1, A2.

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:52.290
And also, you know that
the probability of A1,

00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:54.950
A2 is equal to 1.

00:08:54.950 --> 00:09:01.420
So we've established this part
of the argument down here.

00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:04.930
Now we want to go up and
establish this part of the

00:09:04.930 --> 00:09:10.540
argument, which as I said, I
can't convince myself that

00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:12.930
it's necessary or
not necessary.

00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:17.290
But since I can't convince
myself, I thought, in trying

00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:20.190
to make up solutions for the
quiz, I ought to actually

00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:21.770
write a proof of it.

00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:24.680
And I want to show you what the
proof is so that, if it's

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:28.440
not obvious to you, you'll know
exactly how to do it.

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:33.200
And if it is obvious, you can
maybe sort out exactly why

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:34.170
it's obvious.

00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:36.900
So this is an epsilon delta
kind of argument.

00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:39.680
We assume that omega is in A2.

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:41.590
That's the set for which
the strong law of

00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:43.700
large numbers holds.

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:48.360
There exists some integer, n,
which is a function of both

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:49.900
epsilon and omega.

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:51.790
This is the funny thing
about all of

00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:53.820
these strong law arguments.

00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:56.290
In almost all of them,
you're dealing with

00:09:56.290 --> 00:09:58.170
individual sample paths.

00:09:58.170 --> 00:10:01.400
When you start saying something
exists as a limit,

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:03.980
you're not saying that it exists
as a limit for the

00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:04.980
random variables.

00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:07.470
You're saying it exists
as a limit for a

00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:10.040
set of sample paths.

00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:14.540
And therefore, this epsilon here
that you're gonna choose,

00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:25.090
you need some integer there,
such that this minus this is

00:10:25.090 --> 00:10:26.010
less than epsilon.

00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:28.020
I think I'm going to have
to give up on this.

00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:30.880
These things run out of
batteries too quickly.

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:35.200
So we have that this difference
here must be less

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:39.870
than epsilon if n is bigger than
that m of epsilon omega.

00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:41.670
That's simply what
a limit means.

00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:43.980
That's the definition
of a limit.

00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:47.440
The only way to define a limit
sensibly is to say, for all

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:51.000
epsilon greater than 0, no
matter how small the epsilon

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.500
is, you can always find an
n big enough that this

00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:58.270
difference here is less
than epsilon.

00:10:58.270 --> 00:11:04.210
Then if omega is also in A1, the
limit of N of t of omega

00:11:04.210 --> 00:11:05.790
has to be equal to infinity.

00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:08.640
If you want to, you can just
say, we proved in class that

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:11.820
the limit of t of omega is
equal to infinity with

00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:15.000
probability 1, and introduce
another set, A3.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.450
You want to do a
probability 1.

00:11:16.450 --> 00:11:18.620
But let's do it this way.

00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:21.950
And then there has to be a t,
which is also a function of

00:11:21.950 --> 00:11:24.910
epsilon and omega, such
that N of t and

00:11:24.910 --> 00:11:27.100
omega is greater than--

00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:29.680
that's an integer, by the way.

00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:33.060
That's greater than or equal to
m of epsilon of omega for

00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:35.680
all t, which is greater
than or equal to t

00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:37.660
of epsilon of omega.

00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:41.370
That says that this difference
here is less than omega.

00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:44.700
And that's true for all epsilon
greater than 0.

00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:50.650
And that says that, in fact,
this limit has to exist.

00:11:50.650 --> 00:11:55.300
This limit over here is equal
to Y-bar with probability 1.

00:11:55.300 --> 00:12:03.770
So that's what we were trying to
prove here, that this limit

00:12:03.770 --> 00:12:05.040
is the same as this limit.

00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:07.490
So we found out what
this limit is.

00:12:07.490 --> 00:12:10.350
We found out that it exists with
probability 1, namely on

00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:11.760
the set A2.

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:15.180
This is equal to this, not
necessarily on A2,

00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:17.070
but on A1 and A2.

00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:18.800
So we got into there.

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:22.820
Now how do we get the fact that
this limit times this

00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:24.820
limit is equal to the limit
of [? these. ?]

00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:27.400
Now we have a chance of
proceeding, because we've

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:31.520
actually shown that this limit
exists on some set with

00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:34.730
probability 1, this limit
exists on some set with

00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:36.020
probability 1.

00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:41.090
So we can look at that set and
say, for omega in that set,

00:12:41.090 --> 00:12:43.560
this limit exists and
this limit exists.

00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:47.570
Those limits are non-0 and
they're non-infinite.

00:12:47.570 --> 00:12:51.010
The important thing is that
they're non-infinite.

00:12:51.010 --> 00:12:57.920
And we move on from there,
and to do that carefully.

00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:01.220
And again, I'm not suggesting
that I expect any of you to do

00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:02.190
this on the quiz.

00:13:02.190 --> 00:13:05.230
I would have been amazed
if you had.

00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:09.130
It took me quite a while to sort
it out, because all these

00:13:09.130 --> 00:13:10.380
things are tangled together.

00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:15.480
Where am I?

00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:17.420
I want to be in the
next slide.

00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:18.440
Ah, there we go.

00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:20.870
Finally, we can interchange the
limit of a product of two

00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:21.980
functions--

00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:23.970
say, f of t, g of t--

00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:25.460
with the product
of the limits.

00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:26.820
Can we do that?

00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:29.930
If the two functions each have
finite limits, as the

00:13:29.930 --> 00:13:34.310
functions of interests do for
omega in A1, A2, then the

00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:35.850
answer is yes.

00:13:35.850 --> 00:13:39.700
And if you look at any book
on analysis, I'm sure that

00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:44.060
theorem is somewhere in the
first couple of chapters.

00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:48.050
But anyway, if you're the kind
of person like I am who would

00:13:48.050 --> 00:13:51.230
rather sort something out for
yourself rather than look it

00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:55.220
up, there's a trick involved
in doing it.

00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:57.330
It's this equality right here.

00:13:57.330 --> 00:13:59.940
f of t times g of t minus ab.

00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:04.010
What you want to do is somehow
make that look like f of t

00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:06.490
minus a, which you have
some control over, and

00:14:06.490 --> 00:14:08.090
g of t minus b.

00:14:08.090 --> 00:14:13.340
So the identity is this is equal
to f of t minus a times

00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:15.000
g of t minus b--

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.730
we have control over that--

00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:22.680
plus a times g of t minus b,
plus b times f of t minus a.

00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:25.860
And you multiply and add all
those things together and you

00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:28.710
see that that is just
an identity.

00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:33.940
And therefore the magnitude of
f of t times g of t minus ab

00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:36.280
is less than or equal to this.

00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:39.420
And then you go through all the
epsilon delta stuff again.

00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:43.416
For any epsilon greater than
0, you choose a t such that

00:14:43.416 --> 00:14:46.500
this is less than or equal
to epsilon for t

00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:48.560
greater than the t epsilon.

00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:51.880
This is less than or equal to
epsilon for t greater than or

00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:53.530
equal to t epsilon.

00:14:53.530 --> 00:14:55.900
And then this difference here
is less than or equal to

00:14:55.900 --> 00:14:58.400
epsilon squared plus this.

00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:03.050
And with a little extra fiddling
around, that shows

00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:08.710
you have that f of t, g of t
minus ab approaches 0 as t

00:15:08.710 --> 00:15:09.310
gets large.

00:15:09.310 --> 00:15:11.820
So that's the whole thing.

00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:15.290
Now, let me reemphasize
again, I did not

00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:17.650
expect you to do that.

00:15:17.650 --> 00:15:20.970
I did not expect you to know how
to do analysis arguments

00:15:20.970 --> 00:15:22.890
like that, because
analysis is not a

00:15:22.890 --> 00:15:26.000
prerequisite for the course.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.770
I do want to show you that the
kinds of things we've been

00:15:28.770 --> 00:15:31.520
doing are not, in fact,
impossible.

00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:34.320
If you trace them out from
beginning to end and put in

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:38.180
every little detail in them.

00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:40.700
If you have to go through
these kinds of arguments

00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:44.220
again, you will in fact know
how to make it precise and

00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:48.000
know how to put all
those details in.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.700
Let's go back to countable
state Markov chains.

00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:56.510
As we've said, two states are
in the same class as they

00:15:56.510 --> 00:15:57.780
communicate.

00:15:57.780 --> 00:16:01.410
It's the same definition as
for finite state chains.

00:16:01.410 --> 00:16:05.110
They communicate if there's some
path by which you can get

00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:07.940
from i to j, and there's some
path from which you can get

00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:09.100
from j to i.

00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:14.850
And you can't get there in one
step only, but you can get

00:16:14.850 --> 00:16:16.710
there in some finite
number of steps.

00:16:16.710 --> 00:16:21.950
So that's the definition of
two states communicating.

00:16:21.950 --> 00:16:26.020
The theorem that we sort of
proved last time is that all

00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:27.930
states in the same class are

00:16:27.930 --> 00:16:30.130
recurrent or all are transient.

00:16:30.130 --> 00:16:33.190
That's the same as the theorem
we have for finite state

00:16:33.190 --> 00:16:35.060
Markov chains.

00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:37.970
It's just a little hard
to establish here.

00:16:37.970 --> 00:16:44.010
The argument is that you assume
that j is recurrent.

00:16:44.010 --> 00:16:47.510
If j is recurrent,
then the sum has

00:16:47.510 --> 00:16:49.420
to be equal to infinity.

00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:50.940
How do you interpret
that sum there?

00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:53.780
What is it?

00:16:53.780 --> 00:17:03.050
P sub jj, super n, is the
probability that you will be

00:17:03.050 --> 00:17:06.540
in state j at time n given
that you're in

00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:08.510
state j at time 0.

00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:12.069
So what we're doing is we're
starting out in time 0.

00:17:12.069 --> 00:17:16.450
This quantity here is the
probability that we'll be in

00:17:16.450 --> 00:17:19.569
state j at time n.

00:17:19.569 --> 00:17:24.900
Since you either are or you're
not, since this is also equal

00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:30.830
to the expected value of state
j at time n, given

00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:32.770
state j at time 0.

00:17:32.770 --> 00:17:36.010
So when you add all these up,
you're adding expectations.

00:17:36.010 --> 00:17:39.960
So this quantity here is simply
the expected number of

00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:46.340
recurrences to state j from time
1 up to time infinity.

00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:49.410
And that number of recurrences
is equal to infinity.

00:17:49.410 --> 00:17:53.360
You remember we argued last time
that the probability of

00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:57.380
one recurrence had to be equal
to 1 if it was recurrent.

00:17:57.380 --> 00:18:01.400
If you got back to j once in
finite time, you're going to

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:03.680
get back again in a
finite time again.

00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:05.860
You're going to get back
again in finite time.

00:18:05.860 --> 00:18:08.950
It might take a very, very long
time, but it's finite,

00:18:08.950 --> 00:18:12.290
and you have an infinite number
of returns as time goes

00:18:12.290 --> 00:18:14.470
to infinity.

00:18:14.470 --> 00:18:19.390
So that is the consequence
of j being recurrent.

00:18:19.390 --> 00:18:24.220
For any i such that j and i
communicate, there's some path

00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:28.000
at some length m such that the
probability of going from

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:32.210
state i to state j in m steps
is greater than 0.

00:18:32.210 --> 00:18:35.070
That's by meaning
of communicate.

00:18:35.070 --> 00:18:39.394
And there's some m and
some pji of l.

00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:44.260
Oh, for [? some m. ?]

00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:48.810
And there's some way of getting
back from j to i.

00:18:48.810 --> 00:18:52.680
So what you're doing is going
from state i to state j, and

00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:54.780
there is some path
for doing that.

00:18:54.780 --> 00:18:58.440
You're wobbling around,
returning to state j,

00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:00.580
returning to state j,
maybe returning to

00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:02.270
state i along the way.

00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:03.550
That's part of it.

00:19:03.550 --> 00:19:07.960
And eventually there's
some path for going

00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:11.480
from j back to i again.

00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:16.360
So this sum here is greater
than or equal.

00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:19.745
And now all I'm doing is summing
up the paths which in

00:19:19.745 --> 00:19:24.010
m steps go from i to j, and
those paths which in the final

00:19:24.010 --> 00:19:26.280
l steps go from j back to i.

00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:29.390
And they do whatever they
want to in between.

00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:33.830
So I'm summing over the number
of times they are in between.

00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:38.750
And this sum here is
summing over pjjk.

00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:43.680
And that sum is infinite,
so this sum is infinite.

00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:49.570
So that shows that if j is
recurrent, then i is recurrent

00:19:49.570 --> 00:19:52.760
also for any i in
the same class.

00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:57.870
And you can do the same thing
reversing i and j, obviously.

00:19:57.870 --> 00:20:00.580
And if that's true for all
classes that are very

00:20:00.580 --> 00:20:03.910
recurrent, all law classes that
are transient have to be

00:20:03.910 --> 00:20:06.460
in the same class also, because
a state is either

00:20:06.460 --> 00:20:07.710
transient or it's recurrent.

00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:12.990
If a state j is recurrent,
then the

00:20:12.990 --> 00:20:16.840
recurrence time, T sub jj.

00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:21.800
When you read this chapter or
read my notes, I apologize

00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:25.260
because there's a huge
confusion here.

00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:28.290
And the confusion comes from
the fact that there's an

00:20:28.290 --> 00:20:30.790
extraordinary amount
of notation here.

00:20:30.790 --> 00:20:33.290
We're dealing with all the
notation of finite-state

00:20:33.290 --> 00:20:34.460
Markov chains.

00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:38.350
We're dealing with all the
notation of renewal processes.

00:20:38.350 --> 00:20:41.380
And we're jumping back and forth
between theorems for one

00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:42.980
and theorems for the other.

00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:45.560
And then we're inventing
a lot of new notation.

00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:50.100
And I have to rewrite
that section.

00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:53.330
But anyway, the results are all
correct as far as I know.

00:20:58.710 --> 00:21:01.000
I mean, all of you can remember
notation much better

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:01.860
than I can.

00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:04.450
So if I can remember this
notation, you can also.

00:21:04.450 --> 00:21:05.830
Let me put it that way.

00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:07.900
So I can't feel too
sorry for you.

00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:10.780
I want to rewrite it because I'm
feeling sorry for myself

00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:14.290
after every year I go through
this and try to re-understand

00:21:14.290 --> 00:21:17.070
it again, and I find it
very hard to do it.

00:21:17.070 --> 00:21:20.190
So I'm going to rewrite
it and get rid of

00:21:20.190 --> 00:21:23.120
some of that notation.

00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:27.070
We've already seen that if you
have a chain like this, which

00:21:27.070 --> 00:21:30.230
is simply the Markov chain
corresponding to Bernoulli

00:21:30.230 --> 00:21:35.120
trials, if it's Bernoulli trials
with p equals 1/2, you

00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:37.530
move up a probability
1/2, you move down

00:21:37.530 --> 00:21:39.250
with probability 1/2.

00:21:39.250 --> 00:21:42.280
As we said, you eventually
disperse.

00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:44.960
And as you disperse, the
probability of being in any

00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:48.760
one of these states goes to 0.

00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:55.800
And what that means is that the
individual probabilities

00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:58.260
of the states is going to 0.

00:21:58.260 --> 00:22:02.340
You can also see, not so easily,
that you're eventually

00:22:02.340 --> 00:22:05.560
going to return to each state
with probability 1.

00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:08.650
And I'm sorry I didn't give
that definition first.

00:22:08.650 --> 00:22:10.260
We gave it last time.

00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:14.000
If the expected value of the
renewal time is less than

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.780
infinity, then j is positive
recurrent.

00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:24.260
If T sub jj, the recurrence
time, is a random variable but

00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:28.460
it has infinite expectation,
then j is not recurrent.

00:22:28.460 --> 00:22:32.160
And finally, if none of those
things happen, j is transient.

00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:34.820
So that we went through
last time.

00:22:34.820 --> 00:22:40.880
And for p equals 1/2, and in
both of these situations, the

00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:45.270
probability of being in any
state is going to 0.

00:22:45.270 --> 00:22:50.460
The expected time of returning
is going to infinity.

00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:55.530
But with probability 1, you
will return eventually.

00:22:55.530 --> 00:22:59.880
So in both of these cases, these
are both examples of no

00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:01.130
recurrence.

00:23:03.850 --> 00:23:11.220
Let's say more about positive
recurrence and no recurrence.

00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:16.720
Suppose, first, that i and j
are both recurrent and they

00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:18.400
both communicate with
each other.

00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:21.660
In other words, there's a path
from i to j, there's a path

00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:24.260
from j to i.

00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:28.310
And I want to look at
the renewal process

00:23:28.310 --> 00:23:30.620
of returns to j.

00:23:30.620 --> 00:23:34.440
You've sorted out by now, I
think, that recurrence means

00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:37.070
exactly what you
think it means.

00:23:37.070 --> 00:23:42.110
A recurrence means, starting
from a state j, there's a

00:23:42.110 --> 00:23:46.570
recurrence to j if eventually
you come back to j.

00:23:46.570 --> 00:23:49.760
And this random variable, the
recurrence of random variable,

00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:53.290
is the amount of time it takes
you to get back to j once

00:23:53.290 --> 00:23:54.150
you've been in j.

00:23:54.150 --> 00:23:57.730
That's a random variable.

00:23:57.730 --> 00:24:03.070
So let's look at the renewal
process, starting in j, of

00:24:03.070 --> 00:24:05.430
returning to j eventually.

00:24:05.430 --> 00:24:07.990
This is one of the
things that makes

00:24:07.990 --> 00:24:09.910
this whole study awkward.

00:24:09.910 --> 00:24:15.020
We have renewal processes when
we start at j and we bob back

00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:17.480
to j at various periods
of time.

00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:21.390
If we start in i and we're
interested in returns to j,

00:24:21.390 --> 00:24:25.590
then we have something called
a delayed renewal process.

00:24:25.590 --> 00:24:28.710
All the theorems about
renewals apply there.

00:24:28.710 --> 00:24:31.235
It's a little harder to
see what's going on.

00:24:31.235 --> 00:24:33.890
It's in the end of
chapter four.

00:24:33.890 --> 00:24:36.970
You should have read it,
at least quickly.

00:24:36.970 --> 00:24:40.870
But we're going to avoid those
theorems and instead go

00:24:40.870 --> 00:24:44.080
directly using the theorems
of renewal processes.

00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:48.180
But there's still places where
the transitions are awkward.

00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:50.850
So I can warn you about that.

00:24:50.850 --> 00:24:56.690
But the renewal reward theorem,
if I look at this

00:24:56.690 --> 00:25:00.690
renewal process, I get a
renewal every time I

00:25:00.690 --> 00:25:03.160
return to state j.

00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:07.480
But in that renewal process of
returns to state j, what I'm

00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:11.980
really interested in is returns
to state i, because

00:25:11.980 --> 00:25:15.590
what I'm trying to do here is
relate how often do you go to

00:25:15.590 --> 00:25:19.030
state i with how often
do you go to state j?

00:25:19.030 --> 00:25:21.560
So we have a little bit of a
symmetry in it, because we're

00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:23.880
starting in state j,
because that gives

00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:25.320
us a renewal process.

00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:28.780
But now we have this renewal
reward process, where we give

00:25:28.780 --> 00:25:34.260
ourselves a reward of 1 every
time we hit state i.

00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:38.200
And we have a renewal every
time we hit state j.

00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:40.250
So how does that renewal
process work?

00:25:40.250 --> 00:25:43.810
Well, it's a renewal process
just like every other one

00:25:43.810 --> 00:25:45.210
we've studied.

00:25:45.210 --> 00:25:50.200
It has this peculiar feature
here that is a discrete time

00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:52.000
renewal process.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:55.930
And with discrete time renewal
processes, as we've seen, you

00:25:55.930 --> 00:26:00.070
can save yourself a lot of
aggravation by only looking at

00:26:00.070 --> 00:26:01.230
these discrete times.

00:26:01.230 --> 00:26:04.690
Namely, you only look
at integer times.

00:26:04.690 --> 00:26:07.940
And now when you only look
at integer times--

00:26:07.940 --> 00:26:10.840
well, whether you look at
integer times or not--

00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:14.340
this is the fundamental theorem
of renewal rewards.

00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:18.100
If you look at the limit as t
goes to infinity, there's the

00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:20.420
integral of the rewards
you pick up.

00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:23.810
For this discrete case, this
is just a summation of the

00:26:23.810 --> 00:26:25.550
rewards that you get.

00:26:25.550 --> 00:26:28.950
This summation here by the
theorem is equal to the

00:26:28.950 --> 00:26:33.140
expected number of rewards
within one renewal period.

00:26:33.140 --> 00:26:37.570
Namely, this is the expected
number of recurrences of state

00:26:37.570 --> 00:26:40.100
i per state j.

00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:46.090
So in between each occurrence
of state j, what's the

00:26:46.090 --> 00:26:48.520
expected number of
i's that I hit?

00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:50.330
And that's the number
that it is.

00:26:50.330 --> 00:26:53.510
We don't know what that number
is, but we could calculate it

00:26:53.510 --> 00:26:54.540
if we wanted to.

00:26:54.540 --> 00:26:57.490
It's not a limit of anything.

00:26:57.490 --> 00:27:01.580
Well, it's a sort of a limit,
but not very much of a limit

00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:03.110
that's well defined.

00:27:03.110 --> 00:27:06.150
And the theorem says that this
integral is equal to that

00:27:06.150 --> 00:27:10.040
expected value divided by
the expected recurrence

00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:13.290
time of T sub jj.

00:27:13.290 --> 00:27:18.160
Now, we argue that this is,
in fact, the number of

00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:20.210
occurrences of state i.

00:27:20.210 --> 00:27:21.980
So it's in the limit.

00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:28.620
It's 1 over the expected
value of the recurrence

00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:30.580
time to state i.

00:27:30.580 --> 00:27:35.180
So what this says is the 1 over
the recurrence time to

00:27:35.180 --> 00:27:39.320
state i is equal to the expected
number of recurrences

00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:43.410
to state i per state j divided
by the expected

00:27:43.410 --> 00:27:45.170
time in state j.

00:27:45.170 --> 00:27:49.070
If you think about that for a
minute, it's something which

00:27:49.070 --> 00:27:51.400
is intuitively obvious.

00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:55.060
I mean, you look at this long
sequences of things.

00:27:55.060 --> 00:27:57.780
You keep hitting j's every
once in a while.

00:27:57.780 --> 00:28:00.760
And then what you do,
is you count all of

00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:02.620
the i's that occur.

00:28:02.620 --> 00:28:05.620
So now looking at it this way,
you're going to count the

00:28:05.620 --> 00:28:09.340
number of i's that occur
in between each j.

00:28:09.340 --> 00:28:11.450
You can't have a simultaneous
i and j.

00:28:11.450 --> 00:28:12.960
The state is o or j.

00:28:16.010 --> 00:28:19.250
So for each recurrence period,
you count the number of i's

00:28:19.250 --> 00:28:20.250
that occur.

00:28:20.250 --> 00:28:24.640
And what this is then saying,
is the expected time between

00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:30.920
i's is equal to the expected
time between j's divided by--

00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:34.200
if I turn this equation upside
down, the expected time

00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:38.090
between i's is equal to the
expected time between j's

00:28:38.090 --> 00:28:43.170
divided by the expected
number of i's per j.

00:28:43.170 --> 00:28:45.610
What else would you expect?

00:28:45.610 --> 00:28:48.390
It has to be that way, right?

00:28:48.390 --> 00:28:50.890
But this says that it
indeed, is that way.

00:28:50.890 --> 00:28:54.100
Mathematics is sometimes
confusing with countable-state

00:28:54.100 --> 00:28:58.050
chains as we've seen.

00:28:58.050 --> 00:29:04.890
OK, so the theorem then says for
i and j recurrent, either

00:29:04.890 --> 00:29:09.240
both are positive-recurrent or
both are null-recurrent.

00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:11.610
So this is adding to the
theorem we had earlier.

00:29:11.610 --> 00:29:18.330
The theorem we had earlier says
that all states within a

00:29:18.330 --> 00:29:22.270
class are either recurrent
or they're transient.

00:29:22.270 --> 00:29:25.860
This now divides the ones that
are recurrent into two

00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:29.020
subsets, those that are
null-recurrent and those that

00:29:29.020 --> 00:29:30.630
are positive-recurrent.

00:29:30.630 --> 00:29:34.940
It says that for states within
a class, either all of them

00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:39.130
are recurrent or all
of them are--

00:29:39.130 --> 00:29:41.530
all of them are
positive-recurrent or all of

00:29:41.530 --> 00:29:45.290
them are null-recurrent.

00:29:45.290 --> 00:29:49.610
And this theorem shows it
because this theorem says

00:29:49.610 --> 00:29:53.980
there has to be an expected
number of occurrences of state

00:29:53.980 --> 00:29:56.790
i between each occurrence
of state j.

00:29:56.790 --> 00:29:57.810
Why is that?

00:29:57.810 --> 00:30:01.340
Because there has to be
a path from i to j.

00:30:01.340 --> 00:30:03.710
And there has to be a path that
doesn't go through i.

00:30:03.710 --> 00:30:07.890
Because if you have a path from
i that goes back to i and

00:30:07.890 --> 00:30:12.070
then off to j, there's also
this path from i to j.

00:30:12.070 --> 00:30:14.550
So there's a path from i to j.

00:30:14.550 --> 00:30:18.450
There's a path from j to i that
does not go through i.

00:30:18.450 --> 00:30:22.690
That has positive probability
because paths are only defined

00:30:22.690 --> 00:30:26.300
over transitions with positive
probability.

00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:30.990
So this quantity is always
positive if you're talking

00:30:30.990 --> 00:30:33.520
about two states in
the same class.

00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:39.050
So what this relationship says,
along with the fact that

00:30:39.050 --> 00:30:42.430
it's a very nice and convenient
relationship--

00:30:42.430 --> 00:30:44.590
I almost put it in the
quiz for finite

00:30:44.590 --> 00:30:46.570
state and Markov chains.

00:30:46.570 --> 00:30:49.860
And you cam be happy I didn't,
because proving it takes a

00:30:49.860 --> 00:30:56.100
little more agility than
what one might

00:30:56.100 --> 00:30:57.350
expect at this point.

00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:03.660
The theorem then says that if i
and j are recurrent, either

00:31:03.660 --> 00:31:07.290
both are positive-recurrent or
both are null-recurrent, what

00:31:07.290 --> 00:31:11.040
the overall theorem then says
is that for every class of

00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:15.270
states, either all of them are
transient, all of them are

00:31:15.270 --> 00:31:18.540
null-recurrent, or all of them
are positive-recurrent.

00:31:18.540 --> 00:31:21.550
And that's sort of a convenient
relationship.

00:31:21.550 --> 00:31:25.790
You can't have some states
that you never get to.

00:31:25.790 --> 00:31:29.810
Or you only get to with an
infinite recurrence time in a

00:31:29.810 --> 00:31:33.500
class and others that you keep
coming back to all the time.

00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:37.100
If there's a path from one to
the other, then they have to

00:31:37.100 --> 00:31:38.960
work the same way.

00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:41.330
This sort of makes it
obvious why that is.

00:31:47.410 --> 00:31:51.264
And this is too sensitive.

00:31:51.264 --> 00:31:52.590
OK.

00:31:52.590 --> 00:31:57.010
OK , so now we want to look
at steady state for

00:31:57.010 --> 00:31:58.490
positive-recurrent chain.

00:31:58.490 --> 00:32:00.780
Do you remember that when we
looked at finite state in

00:32:00.780 --> 00:32:04.910
Markov chains, we did all this
classification stuff, and then

00:32:04.910 --> 00:32:08.440
we went into all this
matrix stuff?

00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:12.370
And the outcome of the matrix
stuff, the most important

00:32:12.370 --> 00:32:15.980
things, were that there
is a steady state.

00:32:15.980 --> 00:32:21.130
There's always a set of
probabilities such that if you

00:32:21.130 --> 00:32:24.280
start the chain in those
probabilities, the chain stays

00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:25.910
in those probabilities.

00:32:25.910 --> 00:32:33.590
There's always a set of pi sub
i's, which are probabilities.

00:32:33.590 --> 00:32:36.020
They all sum to 1.

00:32:36.020 --> 00:32:39.020
They're all non-negative.

00:32:39.020 --> 00:32:42.390
And each of them satisfy the
relationship, the probability

00:32:42.390 --> 00:32:47.220
that you're in state j at time
t is equal to the probability

00:32:47.220 --> 00:32:50.470
that you're in state i at
time t minus 1 times the

00:32:50.470 --> 00:32:53.160
probability of going
from state i to j.

00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:57.780
This is completely familiar
from finite-state chains.

00:32:57.780 --> 00:33:00.060
And this is exactly
the same for

00:33:00.060 --> 00:33:02.090
countable-state and Markov chains.

00:33:02.090 --> 00:33:07.140
The only question is, it's now
not at all sure that that

00:33:07.140 --> 00:33:09.820
equation has a solution
anymore.

00:33:09.820 --> 00:33:12.490
And unfortunately, you can't
use matrix theory to prove

00:33:12.490 --> 00:33:14.200
that it has a solution.

00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:17.830
So we have to find some
other way of doing it.

00:33:17.830 --> 00:33:21.750
So we look in our toolbox,
which we developed

00:33:21.750 --> 00:33:23.230
throughout the term.

00:33:23.230 --> 00:33:25.450
And there's only one obvious
thing to try, and

00:33:25.450 --> 00:33:26.970
it's renewal theory.

00:33:26.970 --> 00:33:30.860
So we use renewal theory.

00:33:30.860 --> 00:33:33.750
We then want to have one other
definition, which you'll see

00:33:33.750 --> 00:33:37.330
throughout the rest of the term
and every time you start

00:33:37.330 --> 00:33:39.460
reading about Markov chains.

00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:43.160
When you read about Markov
chains in queuing kinds of

00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:46.900
situations, which are the kinds
of things that occur all

00:33:46.900 --> 00:33:50.490
over the place, almost all of
those Markov chains are

00:33:50.490 --> 00:33:53.430
countable-state Markov chains.

00:33:53.430 --> 00:33:57.860
And therefore, you need a
convenient word to talk about

00:33:57.860 --> 00:34:02.870
a class of states where all of
the states in that class

00:34:02.870 --> 00:34:04.540
communicate with each other.

00:34:04.540 --> 00:34:07.870
And irreducible is the
definition that we use.

00:34:07.870 --> 00:34:12.010
An irreducible Markov chain is
a Markov chain in which all

00:34:12.010 --> 00:34:15.500
pairs of states communicate
with each other.

00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:19.440
And before, when we were talking
about finite-state

00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:24.030
Markov chains, if all states
communicated with each other,

00:34:24.030 --> 00:34:25.170
then they were are recurrent.

00:34:25.170 --> 00:34:28.719
You had a recurrent Markov
chain, end of story.

00:34:28.719 --> 00:34:32.690
Now we've seen that you can have
a Markov chain where all

00:34:32.690 --> 00:34:35.130
the states communicate
with each other.

00:34:35.130 --> 00:34:38.980
We just had these
two examples--

00:34:38.980 --> 00:34:41.830
these two examples here
where they all

00:34:41.830 --> 00:34:43.449
communicate with each other.

00:34:43.449 --> 00:34:47.980
But depending on what p and q
are, they're either transition

00:34:47.980 --> 00:34:52.440
transient, or they're
positive-recurrent, or they're

00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:53.070
null-recurrent.

00:34:53.070 --> 00:34:57.150
The first one can't even be
positive-recurrent, but it can

00:34:57.150 --> 00:34:58.660
be recurrent.

00:34:58.660 --> 00:35:04.940
And the bottom one can also
be positive-recurrent.

00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:10.180
So any Markov chain where all
the states communicate with

00:35:10.180 --> 00:35:10.830
each other--

00:35:10.830 --> 00:35:13.490
there's a path from everything
to everything else--

00:35:13.490 --> 00:35:18.650
which is the usual situation,
is called an irreducible

00:35:18.650 --> 00:35:20.110
Markov chain.

00:35:20.110 --> 00:35:23.680
An irreducible can now be
positive-recurrent,

00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:25.400
null-recurrent, or transient.

00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:29.170
All the states in an irreducible
Markov chain have

00:35:29.170 --> 00:35:32.610
to be transient, or all
of them have to be

00:35:32.610 --> 00:35:35.160
positive-recurrent, or all
of them have to be

00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:36.910
null-recurrent.

00:35:36.910 --> 00:35:39.310
You can't share these
qualities over

00:35:39.310 --> 00:35:41.340
an irreducible chain.

00:35:41.340 --> 00:35:43.290
That's what this last
theorem just said.

00:35:47.750 --> 00:35:52.510
OK, so if a steady
state exists--

00:35:52.510 --> 00:35:56.560
namely if the solution to those
equations exist, and if

00:35:56.560 --> 00:36:01.180
the probability that X sub 0
equals i is equal to pi i.

00:36:01.180 --> 00:36:05.230
And incidentally, in the version
that got handed out,

00:36:05.230 --> 00:36:08.910
that equation there was
a little bit garbled.

00:36:08.910 --> 00:36:10.090
That one.

00:36:10.090 --> 00:36:14.510
Said the probability that X sub
0 was equal to pi i, which

00:36:14.510 --> 00:36:17.180
doesn't make any sense.

00:36:17.180 --> 00:36:20.170
If a steady-state exists
and you start out in

00:36:20.170 --> 00:36:21.090
steady-state--

00:36:21.090 --> 00:36:26.560
namely, the starting state X
sub 0 is in state i with

00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:30.550
probability pi sub i by for
every i, this is the same

00:36:30.550 --> 00:36:31.410
trick we played for

00:36:31.410 --> 00:36:33.440
finite-state and Markov chains.

00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:36.980
As we go through this, I will
try to explain what's the same

00:36:36.980 --> 00:36:38.170
and what's different.

00:36:38.170 --> 00:36:39.640
And this is completely
the same.

00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:41.875
So there's nothing new here.

00:36:45.420 --> 00:36:49.660
Then, this situation of being in
steady-state persists from

00:36:49.660 --> 00:36:52.350
one unit of time to the next.

00:36:52.350 --> 00:36:55.500
Namely, if you start out in
steady-state, then the

00:36:55.500 --> 00:37:05.110
probability that X sub 1 is
equal to j is equal to the sum

00:37:05.110 --> 00:37:07.280
over i of pi sub i.

00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:10.590
That's the probability that
X sub 0 is equal to i.

00:37:10.590 --> 00:37:14.440
Times P sub i j, which by the
steady-state equations, is

00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:15.920
equal to pi sub j.

00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:18.180
So you start out in
steady-state.

00:37:18.180 --> 00:37:21.790
After one transition, you're
in steady-state again.

00:37:21.790 --> 00:37:24.050
You're in steady-state
at time 1.

00:37:24.050 --> 00:37:26.140
Guess what, you're
in state time 2.

00:37:26.140 --> 00:37:27.750
You're in steady-state again.

00:37:27.750 --> 00:37:31.160
And you stay in steady-state
forever.

00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:35.990
So when you iterate, the
probability that you're in

00:37:35.990 --> 00:37:40.440
state j at time X sub n is
equal to pi sub j also.

00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:44.130
This is assuming that you
started out in steady-state.

00:37:44.130 --> 00:37:47.290
So again, we need some
new notation here.

00:37:47.290 --> 00:37:53.760
Let's let N sub j of tilde be
the number of visits to j in

00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:58.020
the period 0 to t starting
in steady-state.

00:37:58.020 --> 00:38:03.820
Namely, if you start in state j,
we get a renewal process to

00:38:03.820 --> 00:38:06.660
talk about the returns
to state j.

00:38:06.660 --> 00:38:11.830
If we start in steady-state,
then this first return to

00:38:11.830 --> 00:38:21.210
state j is going to have a
different set of probabilities

00:38:21.210 --> 00:38:24.120
than all subsequent returns
to state j.

00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:34.880
So N sub j of t, tilde is now
not a renewal process, but a

00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:37.390
delayed renewal process.

00:38:37.390 --> 00:38:39.660
So we have to deal with it
a little bit differently.

00:38:39.660 --> 00:38:43.610
But it's a very nice thing
because for all t, the

00:38:43.610 --> 00:38:50.620
expected number of returns to
state j over t transitions is

00:38:50.620 --> 00:38:53.360
equal to n times pi sub j.

00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:59.280
Pi sub j is the probability that
you will be in state j at

00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:00.920
any time n.

00:39:00.920 --> 00:39:03.050
And it stays the same
for every n.

00:39:03.050 --> 00:39:07.530
So if we look at the expected
number of times we hit state

00:39:07.530 --> 00:39:11.750
j, it's exactly equal
to n times pi sub j.

00:39:11.750 --> 00:39:14.470
And again, here's this
awkward thing about

00:39:14.470 --> 00:39:16.510
renewals and Markov.

00:39:16.510 --> 00:39:17.410
Yes?

00:39:17.410 --> 00:39:20.110
AUDIENCE: So is that sort of
like an ensemble average--

00:39:20.110 --> 00:39:20.560
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:22.520
AUDIENCE: Or is the time
average [INAUDIBLE]?

00:39:22.520 --> 00:39:24.000
PROFESSOR: Well, it's an
ensemble average and it's a

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:25.970
time average.

00:39:25.970 --> 00:39:28.330
But the thing we're working
with here is the

00:39:28.330 --> 00:39:30.150
fact there's a time--

00:39:30.150 --> 00:39:33.370
is the fact that it's an
ensemble average, yes.

00:39:33.370 --> 00:39:35.790
But it's convenient
because it's an

00:39:35.790 --> 00:39:38.290
exact ensemble average.

00:39:38.290 --> 00:39:42.450
Usually, with renewal processes,
things are ugly

00:39:42.450 --> 00:39:45.970
until you start getting
into the limit zone.

00:39:45.970 --> 00:39:49.880
Here, everything is nice
and clean all the time.

00:39:49.880 --> 00:39:52.900
So we start out in steady-state
and we get this

00:39:52.900 --> 00:39:53.790
beautiful result.

00:39:53.790 --> 00:39:55.420
It's starting in steady-state.

00:39:55.420 --> 00:40:00.765
The expected number of visit
to state j by time n--

00:40:00.765 --> 00:40:03.380
oh, this is interesting.

00:40:03.380 --> 00:40:08.915
That t there should
be n obviously.

00:40:15.790 --> 00:40:19.580
Well, since we have t's
everywhere else, that n there

00:40:19.580 --> 00:40:22.360
should probably be t also.

00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:25.670
So you can fix it whichever
way you want.

00:40:25.670 --> 00:40:28.580
n's and t's are the same.

00:40:28.580 --> 00:40:32.185
I mean, for the purposes of this
lecture, let all t's be

00:40:32.185 --> 00:40:33.640
n's and let all n's be t's.

00:40:39.810 --> 00:40:41.420
This works for some things.

00:40:41.420 --> 00:40:44.670
This starts in steady state,
stays in steady state.

00:40:44.670 --> 00:40:47.970
It doesn't work for renewals
because it's a delayed renewal

00:40:47.970 --> 00:40:51.800
process, so you can't talk
about a renewal process

00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:55.130
starting in state j, because you
don't know that it starts

00:40:55.130 --> 00:40:57.520
in state j.

00:40:57.520 --> 00:41:00.810
So sometimes we want
to deal with this.

00:41:00.810 --> 00:41:02.750
Sometimes we want to
deal with this.

00:41:02.750 --> 00:41:06.650
This is the number of returns
to t starting in state j.

00:41:06.650 --> 00:41:14.150
This is the number of returns
to state j over 0 to t if we

00:41:14.150 --> 00:41:16.730
start in steady-state.

00:41:16.730 --> 00:41:20.200
Here's a useful hack, which you
can use a lot of the time.

00:41:23.480 --> 00:41:28.320
Look at what N sub
i j of t is.

00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:31.600
It's the number of times
you hit state j

00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:33.800
starting in state i.

00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:39.370
So let's look at it as you go
for while, you hit state j for

00:41:39.370 --> 00:41:41.240
the first time.

00:41:41.240 --> 00:41:45.120
After hitting state j for the
first time, you then go

00:41:45.120 --> 00:41:47.800
through a number of repetitions
of state j.

00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:51.460
But after that first time you
hit state j, you have a

00:41:51.460 --> 00:41:53.350
renewal process starting then.

00:41:53.350 --> 00:41:57.260
In other words, you have a
delayed renewal process up to

00:41:57.260 --> 00:41:58.590
the first renewal.

00:41:58.590 --> 00:42:00.600
After that, you have
all the statistics

00:42:00.600 --> 00:42:03.060
of a renewal process.

00:42:03.060 --> 00:42:08.720
So the idea then is N
sub i j of t is 1.

00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:13.180
Counts 1 for the first visit
to j, if there are any.

00:42:13.180 --> 00:42:17.700
Plus, N sub i j of t minus
1 for all the subsequent

00:42:17.700 --> 00:42:19.995
recurrences from j to j.

00:42:19.995 --> 00:42:23.330
Thus, when you look at the
expected values of this, the

00:42:23.330 --> 00:42:30.280
expected value of N sub i j of
t is less than or equal to 1

00:42:30.280 --> 00:42:34.720
for this first recurrence, for
this first visit, plus the

00:42:34.720 --> 00:42:40.140
expected value of N sub j j of
some number smaller than t.

00:42:40.140 --> 00:42:44.430
But N sub j j of
t grows with t.

00:42:44.430 --> 00:42:46.980
It's a number of visits
over some interval.

00:42:46.980 --> 00:42:49.710
And as the interval gets bigger
and bigger, the number

00:42:49.710 --> 00:42:52.380
of visits can't shrink.

00:42:52.380 --> 00:42:55.920
So you just put the t there
to make it an upper bound.

00:42:55.920 --> 00:43:00.810
And then, when you look at
starting in steady-state, what

00:43:00.810 --> 00:43:08.080
you get is the sum overall
starting states pi sub i of

00:43:08.080 --> 00:43:12.550
the expected value of
N sub i j of t.

00:43:12.550 --> 00:43:16.120
And this is less than or equal
to 1 plus the expected value

00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:19.030
of N sub j j of t also.

00:43:19.030 --> 00:43:26.485
So this says you can always get
from N tilde of t to N sub

00:43:26.485 --> 00:43:31.220
j j of t, by just giving
up this term 1

00:43:31.220 --> 00:43:33.250
here as an upper bound.

00:43:37.740 --> 00:43:40.150
If you don't like that proof--

00:43:40.150 --> 00:43:42.150
and it's not really a proof.

00:43:42.150 --> 00:43:45.730
If you try to make it a proof,
it gets kind of ugly.

00:43:45.730 --> 00:43:50.710
It's part of the proof of
theorem 4 in the text, which

00:43:50.710 --> 00:43:52.150
is even more ugly.

00:43:52.150 --> 00:43:56.790
Because it's mathematically
clean with equations, but you

00:43:56.790 --> 00:43:59.750
don't get any idea of why it's
true from looking at it.

00:43:59.750 --> 00:44:02.420
This you know why it's true from
looking at it, but you're

00:44:02.420 --> 00:44:05.590
not quite sure that it satisfies
the equations that

00:44:05.590 --> 00:44:07.200
you would like.

00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:10.540
I am trying to move you from
being totally dependent on

00:44:10.540 --> 00:44:15.950
equations to being more
dependent on ideas like this,

00:44:15.950 --> 00:44:17.990
where you can see
what's going on.

00:44:17.990 --> 00:44:22.200
But I'm also urging you, after
you see what's going on, to

00:44:22.200 --> 00:44:25.500
have a way to put the equations
in to see that

00:44:25.500 --> 00:44:28.170
you're absolutely
right with it.

00:44:28.170 --> 00:44:32.100
OK, now, we come to the major
theorem of countable-state and

00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:32.980
Markov chains.

00:44:32.980 --> 00:44:35.920
It's sort of the crucial
thing that everything

00:44:35.920 --> 00:44:37.340
else is based on.

00:44:37.340 --> 00:44:43.350
I mean, everything beyond
what we've already done.

00:44:43.350 --> 00:44:46.370
For any irreducible
Markov chain--

00:44:46.370 --> 00:44:49.810
in other words, for any Markov
chain where all the states

00:44:49.810 --> 00:44:55.100
communicate with each other,
the steady-state equations

00:44:55.100 --> 00:44:59.560
have a solution if and only
if the states are

00:44:59.560 --> 00:45:00.640
positive-recurrent.

00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:03.650
Now, remember, either all the
states are positive-recurrent

00:45:03.650 --> 00:45:04.710
or none of them are.

00:45:04.710 --> 00:45:07.750
So there's nothing
confusing there.

00:45:07.750 --> 00:45:10.610
If all the states are
positive-recurrent, then there

00:45:10.610 --> 00:45:12.460
is a steady-state solution.

00:45:12.460 --> 00:45:16.190
There is a solution to
those equations.

00:45:16.190 --> 00:45:22.090
And if the set of states are
transient, or null-recurrent,

00:45:22.090 --> 00:45:24.880
then there isn't a solution
to all those equations.

00:45:24.880 --> 00:45:31.040
If a solution exists, then the
probability, the steady-state

00:45:31.040 --> 00:45:35.980
probability is state i is 1 over
the main recurrence time

00:45:35.980 --> 00:45:36.960
to state i.

00:45:36.960 --> 00:45:40.570
This is a relationship that we
established by using renewal

00:45:40.570 --> 00:45:43.580
theory for finite-state
and Markov chains.

00:45:43.580 --> 00:45:45.315
We're just coming
back to it here.

00:45:48.180 --> 00:45:52.050
One thing which is important
here is that pi sub i is

00:45:52.050 --> 00:45:54.040
greater than 0 for all i.

00:45:54.040 --> 00:45:56.690
This is a property we
had for finite-state

00:45:56.690 --> 00:45:58.780
Markov chains also.

00:45:58.780 --> 00:46:01.340
But it's a good deal more
surprising here.

00:46:01.340 --> 00:46:04.520
When you have a countable number
of states, saying that

00:46:04.520 --> 00:46:09.490
every one of them has a positive
probability is--

00:46:09.490 --> 00:46:12.100
I don't think it's entirely
intuitive.

00:46:12.100 --> 00:46:13.700
If you think about it
for a long time,

00:46:13.700 --> 00:46:15.810
it's sort of intuitive.

00:46:15.810 --> 00:46:18.560
But it's the kind of intuitive
thing that really pushes your

00:46:18.560 --> 00:46:23.360
intuition into understanding
what's going on.

00:46:23.360 --> 00:46:31.910
So let's give a Pf of this,
of the only if part.

00:46:31.910 --> 00:46:33.660
And I will warn you
about reading the

00:46:33.660 --> 00:46:35.770
proof in the notes.

00:46:35.770 --> 00:46:39.470
It's ugly because it just goes
through a bunch of logical

00:46:39.470 --> 00:46:41.500
relationships and equations.

00:46:41.500 --> 00:46:45.070
You have no idea of where
it's going or why.

00:46:45.070 --> 00:46:47.210
And finally, at the
end it says, QED.

00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:50.430
I went through it.

00:46:50.430 --> 00:46:51.450
It's correct.

00:46:51.450 --> 00:46:54.790
But damned if I know why.

00:46:54.790 --> 00:46:59.560
And so, anyway, that has
to be rewritten.

00:46:59.560 --> 00:47:02.040
But, anyway here's the Pf.

00:47:02.040 --> 00:47:06.140
Start out by assuming that the
steady-state equations exist.

00:47:06.140 --> 00:47:07.390
We want to show
positive-recurrence.

00:47:10.210 --> 00:47:14.110
Pick any j and any t.

00:47:14.110 --> 00:47:17.140
Pick any state and any time.

00:47:17.140 --> 00:47:24.540
pi sub j is equal to the
expected value of N sub j

00:47:24.540 --> 00:47:26.050
tilde of t.

00:47:26.050 --> 00:47:27.890
That we chose for any
Markov chain at all.

00:47:27.890 --> 00:47:30.650
If you start out in
steady-state, you stay in

00:47:30.650 --> 00:47:31.850
steady-state.

00:47:31.850 --> 00:47:34.720
So under the assumption that
we're in steady-state--

00:47:37.900 --> 00:47:40.250
under the assumption that we
start out in steady-state, we

00:47:40.250 --> 00:47:42.370
stay in steady-state.

00:47:42.370 --> 00:47:48.520
This pi sub j times t has to be
the expected value of the

00:47:48.520 --> 00:47:54.120
number of recurrences to state
j over t time units.

00:47:54.120 --> 00:48:00.170
And what we showed on
the last slide--

00:48:00.170 --> 00:48:04.050
you must have realized I was
doing this for some reason.

00:48:04.050 --> 00:48:07.990
This is less than or equal to 1
plus the expected recurrence

00:48:07.990 --> 00:48:09.630
time of state j.

00:48:14.410 --> 00:48:18.540
So pi sub j is less than or
equal to 1 over t times this

00:48:18.540 --> 00:48:22.340
expected recurrence
time for state j.

00:48:22.340 --> 00:48:26.870
And if we go to the limit as t
goes to infinity, this 1 over

00:48:26.870 --> 00:48:29.680
t dribbles away to
nothingness.

00:48:29.680 --> 00:48:33.610
So this is less than or equal to
the limit of expected value

00:48:33.610 --> 00:48:36.300
of N sub j j of t over t.

00:48:36.300 --> 00:48:38.350
What is that?

00:48:38.350 --> 00:48:42.210
That's the expected number,
long-term rate of

00:48:42.210 --> 00:48:44.600
visits to state j.

00:48:44.600 --> 00:48:49.670
It's what we've shown as equal
to 1 over the expected renewal

00:48:49.670 --> 00:48:53.193
time of state j.

00:48:53.193 --> 00:48:59.350
Now, if the sum of the pi sub
j's is equal to 1, remember

00:48:59.350 --> 00:49:03.930
what happens when you sum a
countable set of numbers.

00:49:03.930 --> 00:49:07.940
If all of them are 0, then no
matter how many of them you

00:49:07.940 --> 00:49:09.960
sum, you have 0.

00:49:09.960 --> 00:49:13.100
And when you go to the limit,
you still have 0.

00:49:13.100 --> 00:49:16.550
So when you sum a set of
countable set of non-negative

00:49:16.550 --> 00:49:18.020
numbers, you have
to have a limit.

00:49:20.990 --> 00:49:22.240
Because it's non-decreasing.

00:49:24.720 --> 00:49:27.010
And that sum is equal to 1.

00:49:27.010 --> 00:49:29.670
Then somewhere along the line,
you've got to find the

00:49:29.670 --> 00:49:32.060
positive probability.

00:49:32.060 --> 00:49:33.180
One of the [INAUDIBLE]

00:49:33.180 --> 00:49:34.430
has to be positive.

00:49:37.300 --> 00:49:40.610
I mean, this is almost an
amusing proof because you work

00:49:40.610 --> 00:49:44.250
so hard to prove that one
of them is positive.

00:49:44.250 --> 00:49:47.580
And then, almost for free, you
get the fact that all of them

00:49:47.580 --> 00:49:50.790
have to be positive.

00:49:50.790 --> 00:49:53.940
So some pi j is greater
than 0.

00:49:53.940 --> 00:49:58.240
If pi j is less than or equal
to this, thus the limit as t

00:49:58.240 --> 00:50:02.570
approaches infinity of the
expected value of N sub j j of

00:50:02.570 --> 00:50:08.740
t over t is greater than 0 for
that j, which says j has to be

00:50:08.740 --> 00:50:10.930
positive-recurrent.

00:50:10.930 --> 00:50:15.270
Which says all the states have
to be positive-recurrent

00:50:15.270 --> 00:50:17.110
because we've already
shown that.

00:50:17.110 --> 00:50:19.910
So all the states are
positive-recurrent.

00:50:19.910 --> 00:50:23.390
Then you still have to show that
this inequality here is

00:50:23.390 --> 00:50:27.070
equality, and you've got to do
that by playing around with

00:50:27.070 --> 00:50:28.805
summing up these things.

00:50:33.660 --> 00:50:35.670
Something has been left
out, we have to sum

00:50:35.670 --> 00:50:37.150
those up over j.

00:50:37.150 --> 00:50:38.250
And that's another mess.

00:50:38.250 --> 00:50:40.210
I'm not going to do
it here in class.

00:50:40.210 --> 00:50:42.030
But just sort of see
why this happened.

00:50:42.030 --> 00:50:42.512
Yeah?

00:50:42.512 --> 00:50:43.762
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:50:46.368 --> 00:50:49.260
Why do you have to show
the equality?

00:50:49.260 --> 00:50:51.630
PROFESSOR: Why do I have
to the equality?

00:50:51.630 --> 00:50:57.320
Because if I want to show that
all of the pi sub i's are

00:50:57.320 --> 00:51:01.190
positive, how do I show that?

00:51:01.190 --> 00:51:03.050
All I've done is started
out with an arbitrary--

00:51:03.050 --> 00:51:05.550
oh, I've started out with
an arbitrary j and

00:51:05.550 --> 00:51:08.830
an arbitrary t.

00:51:08.830 --> 00:51:12.830
Because I got the fact that this
was positive-recurrent by

00:51:12.830 --> 00:51:14.740
arguing that at least
one of the pi sub

00:51:14.740 --> 00:51:16.430
j's had to be positive.

00:51:16.430 --> 00:51:18.060
From this I can argue
that they're all

00:51:18.060 --> 00:51:22.690
positive-recurrent, which tells
me that this number is

00:51:22.690 --> 00:51:24.070
greater than 0.

00:51:24.070 --> 00:51:29.430
But that doesn't show me that
this number is greater than 0.

00:51:29.430 --> 00:51:30.570
But it is.

00:51:30.570 --> 00:51:31.380
I mean, it's all right.

00:51:31.380 --> 00:51:33.600
It all works out.

00:51:33.600 --> 00:51:38.080
But not quite in such a simple
way as you would hope.

00:51:38.080 --> 00:51:43.290
OK, so now let's go back to
what we called birth-death

00:51:43.290 --> 00:51:50.770
chains, but look at a slightly
more general version of them.

00:51:50.770 --> 00:51:53.630
These are things that you--

00:51:53.630 --> 00:51:56.710
I mean, queuing theory is
built on these things.

00:51:56.710 --> 00:51:59.260
Everything in queuing theory.

00:51:59.260 --> 00:52:02.900
Or not everything, but all the
things that come from a

00:52:02.900 --> 00:52:06.090
Poisson kind of background.

00:52:06.090 --> 00:52:12.880
All of these somehow look at
the birth-death chains.

00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:17.110
And the way a birth-death
chain works is you have

00:52:17.110 --> 00:52:19.670
arbitrary self-loops.

00:52:19.670 --> 00:52:22.780
You have positive probabilities
going from each

00:52:22.780 --> 00:52:25.760
state to the next state up.

00:52:25.760 --> 00:52:30.460
You have positive probabilities
going from the

00:52:30.460 --> 00:52:33.390
higher state to the
lower state.

00:52:33.390 --> 00:52:35.830
All transitions are
limited from--

00:52:35.830 --> 00:52:41.560
i can only go to i plus 1,
or i, for i minus 1.

00:52:41.560 --> 00:52:42.760
You can't make big jumps.

00:52:42.760 --> 00:52:46.340
You can only make jumps
of one step.

00:52:46.340 --> 00:52:49.540
And other than that, it's
completely general.

00:52:49.540 --> 00:52:52.485
OK, now we go through an
interesting argument.

00:52:55.210 --> 00:53:00.160
We look at an arbitrary
state i.

00:53:00.160 --> 00:53:08.080
And for this arbitrary state i,
like i equals 2, we look at

00:53:08.080 --> 00:53:11.860
the number of transitions
that go from 2 to 3.

00:53:11.860 --> 00:53:15.440
And the number transitions that
go from 3 to 2 for any

00:53:15.440 --> 00:53:18.010
old sample path whatsoever.

00:53:18.010 --> 00:53:20.370
And for any sample path,
the number of

00:53:20.370 --> 00:53:22.830
transitions that go up--

00:53:22.830 --> 00:53:27.430
if we start down there, before
you can come back,

00:53:27.430 --> 00:53:28.770
you've got to go up.

00:53:28.770 --> 00:53:33.120
So if you're on that side, you
have one more up transition

00:53:33.120 --> 00:53:34.880
than you have down transition.

00:53:34.880 --> 00:53:37.900
If you're on that side, you
have the same number of up

00:53:37.900 --> 00:53:41.470
transitions and down
transitions.

00:53:41.470 --> 00:53:44.870
So that as you look over a
longer and longer time, the

00:53:44.870 --> 00:53:49.280
number of up transitions is
effectively the same as the

00:53:49.280 --> 00:53:50.560
number of down transitions.

00:53:53.540 --> 00:53:58.420
If you have a steady-state, pi
sub i is the fraction of time

00:53:58.420 --> 00:54:00.270
you're in state i.

00:54:00.270 --> 00:54:08.340
pi sub i times p sub i is the
fraction of time you're going

00:54:08.340 --> 00:54:12.860
from state i to state
i plus 1.

00:54:12.860 --> 00:54:19.720
And pi sub i by plus 1 times q
sub i plus 1 is the fraction

00:54:19.720 --> 00:54:22.310
of time you're going
from state i plus 1

00:54:22.310 --> 00:54:23.680
down to state i.

00:54:23.680 --> 00:54:32.160
What we've just argued by the
fact that sample path averages

00:54:32.160 --> 00:54:37.940
and ensemble averages have to
be equal is that pi sub i

00:54:37.940 --> 00:54:42.750
times p sub i is equal to
pi sub i plus 1 times

00:54:42.750 --> 00:54:44.000
q sub i plus 1.

00:54:47.150 --> 00:54:50.400
In the next slide, I will
talk about whether to

00:54:50.400 --> 00:54:52.290
believe that or not.

00:54:52.290 --> 00:54:55.810
For the moment, let's
say we believe it.

00:54:55.810 --> 00:55:00.520
And from this equation, we
see that the steady-state

00:55:00.520 --> 00:55:04.960
probability of i plus 1 is
equal to the steady-state

00:55:04.960 --> 00:55:10.430
probability of i times p sub
i over q sub i plus 1.

00:55:10.430 --> 00:55:14.460
It says that the steady-state
probability of each pi is

00:55:14.460 --> 00:55:19.020
determined by the steady-state
probability of the state

00:55:19.020 --> 00:55:20.000
underneath it.

00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:21.410
So you just go up.

00:55:21.410 --> 00:55:24.100
You can calculate the
steady-state of each, the

00:55:24.100 --> 00:55:27.890
probability of each if you know
the probability of the

00:55:27.890 --> 00:55:30.000
state below it.

00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:36.300
So if you recurse on this, pi
sub i plus 1 is equal to pi

00:55:36.300 --> 00:55:41.470
sub i times this ratio is equal
to pi sub i minus 1

00:55:41.470 --> 00:55:47.170
times this ratio times p sub i
minus 1 over q sub i is equal

00:55:47.170 --> 00:55:52.390
to pi sub i minus 2 times
this triple of things.

00:55:52.390 --> 00:55:56.676
It tells you that what you want
to do is define row sub i

00:55:56.676 --> 00:56:01.580
as the difference of these two
probabilities, namely rob i,

00:56:01.580 --> 00:56:06.700
for any state i, is the ratio
of that probability to that

00:56:06.700 --> 00:56:08.310
probability.

00:56:08.310 --> 00:56:15.820
And this equation then turns
into pi sub i plus 1 equals pi

00:56:15.820 --> 00:56:18.620
sub i times row sub i.

00:56:18.620 --> 00:56:20.530
If you put all those
things together--

00:56:20.530 --> 00:56:23.490
if you just paste them one after
the other, the way I was

00:56:23.490 --> 00:56:24.710
suggesting--

00:56:24.710 --> 00:56:30.480
what you get is pi sub i is
equal to pi sub 0 times this

00:56:30.480 --> 00:56:32.230
product of terms.

00:56:32.230 --> 00:56:35.930
The product of terms looks
a little ugly.

00:56:35.930 --> 00:56:38.270
Why don't I care about
that very much?

00:56:38.270 --> 00:56:41.590
Well, because usually, when you
have a chain like this,

00:56:41.590 --> 00:56:44.930
all the Ps are the same and
all the Qs are the same--

00:56:44.930 --> 00:56:49.110
or all the Ps are the same for
some point beyond someplace,

00:56:49.110 --> 00:56:52.240
they're are different
before that.

00:56:52.240 --> 00:56:54.670
There's always some structure
to make life easy for you.

00:56:58.150 --> 00:56:58.950
Oh, that's my computer.

00:56:58.950 --> 00:57:00.450
It's telling me what
time it is.

00:57:00.450 --> 00:57:03.310
I'm sorry.

00:57:03.310 --> 00:57:03.740
OK.

00:57:03.740 --> 00:57:07.080
So pi sub i is this.

00:57:07.080 --> 00:57:10.070
We then have to calculate
pi sub 0.

00:57:10.070 --> 00:57:14.810
Pi sub 0 is then 1 divided
by the sum of all the

00:57:14.810 --> 00:57:19.730
probabilities is pi sub 0 times
all those other things.

00:57:19.730 --> 00:57:23.490
It's 1 plus the sum here.

00:57:23.490 --> 00:57:29.680
And now if you don't believe
what I did here, and I don't

00:57:29.680 --> 00:57:32.710
blame you for being a little
bit skeptical.

00:57:32.710 --> 00:57:39.160
If you don't believe this, then
you look at this and you

00:57:39.160 --> 00:57:43.150
say, OK, I can now go back and
look at the steady state

00:57:43.150 --> 00:57:47.080
equations themselves and I can
plug this into the steady

00:57:47.080 --> 00:57:49.240
state equations themselves.

00:57:49.240 --> 00:57:53.020
And you will immediately see
that this solution satisfies

00:57:53.020 --> 00:57:55.450
the steady state equations.

00:57:55.450 --> 00:57:57.540
OK.

00:57:57.540 --> 00:57:59.310
Oh, damn.

00:57:59.310 --> 00:58:00.560
Excuse my language.

00:58:03.930 --> 00:58:05.180
OK.

00:58:08.330 --> 00:58:12.370
So we have our birth-death
chain with all these

00:58:12.370 --> 00:58:14.150
transitions here.

00:58:14.150 --> 00:58:17.710
We have our solution to it.

00:58:17.710 --> 00:58:23.500
Note that the solution is only
a function of these rows.

00:58:23.500 --> 00:58:28.150
It's only a function of the
ratio of p sub i to

00:58:28.150 --> 00:58:29.790
Q sub i plus 1.

00:58:29.790 --> 00:58:33.560
It doesn't depend on those
self loops at all.

00:58:33.560 --> 00:58:34.810
Isn't that peculiar?

00:58:37.400 --> 00:58:41.606
Completely independent of what
those self loops are.

00:58:41.606 --> 00:58:44.470
Well, you'll see later that it's
not totally independent

00:58:44.470 --> 00:58:46.685
of it, but it's essentially
independent of it.

00:58:50.050 --> 00:58:54.930
And you think about that for a
while and suddenly it's not

00:58:54.930 --> 00:58:59.810
that confusing because those
equations have come from

00:58:59.810 --> 00:59:03.770
looking at up transitions
and down transitions.

00:59:03.770 --> 00:59:07.720
By looking at an up transition
and a down transition at one

00:59:07.720 --> 00:59:12.100
place here, it tells you
something about the fraction

00:59:12.100 --> 00:59:14.750
of time you're over there and
the fraction of time you're

00:59:14.750 --> 00:59:17.070
down there if you know what
these steady state

00:59:17.070 --> 00:59:18.940
probabilities are.

00:59:18.940 --> 00:59:21.830
So if you think about it for a
bit, you realize that these

00:59:21.830 --> 00:59:26.060
steady state probabilities
cannot depend that strongly on

00:59:26.060 --> 00:59:27.270
what those self loops are.

00:59:27.270 --> 00:59:30.901
So this all sort
of makes sense.

00:59:30.901 --> 00:59:34.580
The next thing is the expression
for pi 0--

00:59:34.580 --> 00:59:36.360
namely this thing here--

00:59:36.360 --> 00:59:37.780
is a product of these terms.

00:59:40.460 --> 00:59:44.360
It converges and therefore the
chain is positive recurrent

00:59:44.360 --> 00:59:47.650
because there is a solution to
the steady state equation.

00:59:47.650 --> 00:59:50.750
It converges if the
row sub i's are

00:59:50.750 --> 00:59:54.870
asymptotically less than 1.

00:59:54.870 --> 00:59:57.900
So for example, if
the row sub i's--

00:59:57.900 --> 01:00:00.390
beyond i equals 100--

01:00:00.390 --> 01:00:05.500
are bounded by, say, 0.9, then
these terms have to go to 0

01:00:05.500 --> 01:00:11.420
rapidly after i equals 100 and
this product has to converge.

01:00:11.420 --> 01:00:15.380
I say essentially here of all
these particular cases where

01:00:15.380 --> 01:00:19.520
the row sub i's are very close
to 1, and they're converging

01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:23.190
very slowly to 1
and who knows.

01:00:23.190 --> 01:00:26.130
But for most of the things we
do, these row sub i's are

01:00:26.130 --> 01:00:29.640
strictly less than
1 as you move up.

01:00:29.640 --> 01:00:33.140
And it says that you have
to have steady state

01:00:33.140 --> 01:00:34.600
probabilities.

01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:42.310
So for most birth-death chains,
it's almost immediate

01:00:42.310 --> 01:00:46.280
to establish whether it's
recurrent, positive recurrent,

01:00:46.280 --> 01:00:48.410
or not positive recurrent.

01:00:48.410 --> 01:00:51.270
And we'll talk more about that
when we get into Markov

01:00:51.270 --> 01:00:56.470
processes, but that's enough
of it for now.

01:00:56.470 --> 01:00:59.200
Comment on methodology.

01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:02.750
We could check the renewal
results carefully, because

01:01:02.750 --> 01:01:05.820
what we're doing here is
assuming something rather

01:01:05.820 --> 01:01:11.590
peculiar about time averages
and ensemble averages.

01:01:11.590 --> 01:01:14.840
And sometimes you have to worry
about those things, but

01:01:14.840 --> 01:01:17.990
here, we don't have to worry
about it because we have this

01:01:17.990 --> 01:01:20.940
major theorem which tells
us if steady state

01:01:20.940 --> 01:01:22.720
probabilities exist--

01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:25.390
and they exist because they
satisfy these equations--

01:01:25.390 --> 01:01:27.800
then you have positive
recurrence.

01:01:27.800 --> 01:01:32.510
So it says the methodology to
use is not to get involved in

01:01:32.510 --> 01:01:34.750
any deep theory, but just
to see if these

01:01:34.750 --> 01:01:36.750
equations are satisfied.

01:01:36.750 --> 01:01:41.070
Again, good mathematicians
are lazy--

01:01:41.070 --> 01:01:43.870
good engineers are
even lazier.

01:01:43.870 --> 01:01:47.110
That's my motto of the day.

01:01:47.110 --> 01:01:50.180
And finally, birth-death
chains are going to be

01:01:50.180 --> 01:01:54.770
particularly useful in queuing
where the births are arrivals

01:01:54.770 --> 01:01:56.233
and the deaths are departures.

01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:00.670
OK.

01:02:00.670 --> 01:02:02.980
Now we come to reversibility.

01:02:02.980 --> 01:02:06.930
I'm glad we're coming to that
towards the end of the lecture

01:02:06.930 --> 01:02:12.400
because reversibility is
something which I don't think

01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:15.340
any of you guys even--

01:02:15.340 --> 01:02:17.500
and I think this is a
pretty smart class--

01:02:17.500 --> 01:02:20.570
but I've never seen anybody who
understands reversibility

01:02:20.570 --> 01:02:22.850
the first time they
think about it.

01:02:22.850 --> 01:02:29.140
It's a very peculiar concept and
the results coming from it

01:02:29.140 --> 01:02:34.490
are peculiar, and we will have
to live with it for a while.

01:02:34.490 --> 01:02:40.250
But let's start out with
the easy things--

01:02:40.250 --> 01:02:44.810
just with a definition of
what a Markov chain is.

01:02:44.810 --> 01:02:49.480
This top equation here says
that the probability of a

01:02:49.480 --> 01:02:52.620
whole bunch of states--

01:02:52.620 --> 01:02:57.790
X sub n plus k down to X sub n
plus 1 given the stated time,

01:02:57.790 --> 01:03:00.900
n, down to the stated time 0.

01:03:00.900 --> 01:03:04.200
Because of the Markov condition,
that has to be

01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:07.190
equal to the probability
of these terms

01:03:07.190 --> 01:03:09.580
just given X sub n.

01:03:09.580 --> 01:03:12.890
Namely, if you know what X sub
n is, for the future, you

01:03:12.890 --> 01:03:16.060
don't have to know what any of
those previous states are.

01:03:16.060 --> 01:03:19.980
You get that directly from
where we started with the

01:03:19.980 --> 01:03:23.040
Markov chains-- the probability
of X sub n plus 1,

01:03:23.040 --> 01:03:25.400
given all this stuff, and
then you just add the

01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:27.260
other things onto it.

01:03:27.260 --> 01:03:34.530
Now, if you define A plus as any
event which is defined in

01:03:34.530 --> 01:03:40.660
terms of X sub n plus 1, X of n
plus 2, and so forth up, and

01:03:40.660 --> 01:03:44.670
if you define A minus as
anything which is a function

01:03:44.670 --> 01:03:51.410
of X sub n minus 1, X sub n
minus 2, down to X sub 0, then

01:03:51.410 --> 01:03:54.130
what this equations
says is that the

01:03:54.130 --> 01:03:57.180
probability of any A plus--

01:03:57.180 --> 01:03:59.900
given X sub n and A minus--

01:03:59.900 --> 01:04:06.080
is equal to the probability
of A plus given X sub n.

01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:08.140
And this hasn't gotten
hard yet.

01:04:08.140 --> 01:04:10.770
If you think this is
hard, just wait.

01:04:16.230 --> 01:04:19.670
If we now multiply this by
the probability of A

01:04:19.670 --> 01:04:21.800
minus given X sub n--

01:04:21.800 --> 01:04:26.130
and what I'm trying to get at
is, how do you reason about

01:04:26.130 --> 01:04:28.560
the probabilities of
earlier states

01:04:28.560 --> 01:04:30.440
given the present state?

01:04:30.440 --> 01:04:33.790
We're used to proceeding
in time.

01:04:33.790 --> 01:04:36.930
We're used to looking at
the past for telling

01:04:36.930 --> 01:04:39.300
what the future is.

01:04:39.300 --> 01:04:41.540
And every once and a while, you
want to look at the future

01:04:41.540 --> 01:04:44.036
and predict what the
past had to be.

01:04:44.036 --> 01:04:48.470
It's probably more important to
talk about the future given

01:04:48.470 --> 01:04:50.585
the past, because sometimes
you don't know

01:04:50.585 --> 01:04:51.450
what the future is.

01:04:51.450 --> 01:04:55.210
But mathematically, you
have to sort that out.

01:04:55.210 --> 01:05:02.620
So if we multiply this equation
by the probability of

01:05:02.620 --> 01:05:05.350
A minus, given X sub n,
we don't know what

01:05:05.350 --> 01:05:08.950
that is, but it exists.

01:05:08.950 --> 01:05:11.370
It's a defined conditional
probability.

01:05:11.370 --> 01:05:14.460
Then what we get is the
probability of A plus and A

01:05:14.460 --> 01:05:18.710
minus, given X sub n, is equal
to the probability of A plus,

01:05:18.710 --> 01:05:21.410
given X sub n, times the
probability of A

01:05:21.410 --> 01:05:24.060
minus, given X sub n.

01:05:24.060 --> 01:05:28.940
So that the probability of the
future and the past, given

01:05:28.940 --> 01:05:32.350
what's happening now, is equal
to the probability of the

01:05:32.350 --> 01:05:35.970
future, given what's happening
now, times the probability the

01:05:35.970 --> 01:05:38.760
past, given what's
happening now.

01:05:38.760 --> 01:05:41.160
Which may be a more interesting
way of looking at

01:05:41.160 --> 01:05:45.560
past and future and present
than this totally

01:05:45.560 --> 01:05:46.710
asymmetric way here.

01:05:46.710 --> 01:05:50.720
This is a nice, symmetric
way of looking at it.

01:05:50.720 --> 01:05:54.810
And as soon as you see that this
has to be true, then you

01:05:54.810 --> 01:05:58.680
can turn around and write this
the opposite way, and you see

01:05:58.680 --> 01:06:02.365
that the probability of A minus,
given X sub n, and A

01:06:02.365 --> 01:06:04.570
plus is equal to the
probability of A

01:06:04.570 --> 01:06:08.670
minus given X sub n.

01:06:08.670 --> 01:06:12.120
Which says that the probability
of the past, given

01:06:12.120 --> 01:06:15.970
X sub n and the future, is equal
to the probability of

01:06:15.970 --> 01:06:19.560
the past just given X sub n.

01:06:19.560 --> 01:06:24.530
You can go from past the future
or you can go from

01:06:24.530 --> 01:06:26.780
future to past.

01:06:26.780 --> 01:06:33.020
And incidentally, if you people
have trouble trying to

01:06:33.020 --> 01:06:35.530
think of the past and
the future as

01:06:35.530 --> 01:06:38.210
being symmetric animals--

01:06:38.210 --> 01:06:39.460
and I do too--

01:06:41.810 --> 01:06:47.090
everything we do with time can
also be done on a line going

01:06:47.090 --> 01:06:49.770
from left to right, or it
can be done on a line

01:06:49.770 --> 01:06:51.210
going from bottom up.

01:06:51.210 --> 01:06:55.150
Going from bottom up, it's
hard to say that this is

01:06:55.150 --> 01:06:56.430
symmetric to this.

01:06:56.430 --> 01:07:00.950
If you look at it on a line
going from left to right, it's

01:07:00.950 --> 01:07:04.950
kind of easy to see that this
is symmetric between left to

01:07:04.950 --> 01:07:07.290
right and right to left.

01:07:07.290 --> 01:07:10.900
So every time you get confused
about these arguments, put

01:07:10.900 --> 01:07:15.180
them on a line and argue right
to left and left to right

01:07:15.180 --> 01:07:18.670
instead of earlier and later.

01:07:18.670 --> 01:07:23.080
Because mathematically, it's
the same thing, but it's

01:07:23.080 --> 01:07:25.950
easier to see these
symmetries.

01:07:25.950 --> 01:07:30.400
And now, if you think of A minus
as being X sub n minus

01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:35.060
1, and you think of A plus as
being X sub n plus 1, X sub n

01:07:35.060 --> 01:07:38.920
plus 2 and so forth up, what
this equation says is that the

01:07:38.920 --> 01:07:43.820
probability of the last state
in the past, given the state

01:07:43.820 --> 01:07:47.180
now and everything in the
future, is equal to the

01:07:47.180 --> 01:07:52.690
probability of the last state
in the past given X sub n.

01:07:52.690 --> 01:07:54.570
Now, this isn't reversibility.

01:07:54.570 --> 01:07:58.350
I'm not saying that these
are special process.

01:07:58.350 --> 01:08:02.640
This is true for any Markov
chain in the world.

01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:05.470
These relationships
are always true.

01:08:05.470 --> 01:08:12.750
This is one reason why many
people view this as the real

01:08:12.750 --> 01:08:17.310
Markov condition, as opposed to
any of these other things.

01:08:17.310 --> 01:08:22.010
They say that three events
have a Markov condition

01:08:22.010 --> 01:08:25.720
between them if there's
one of them which is

01:08:25.720 --> 01:08:27.899
in between the other.

01:08:27.899 --> 01:08:31.590
Where you can say that the
probability of the left one,

01:08:31.590 --> 01:08:34.560
given the middle one, times
the right one, given the

01:08:34.560 --> 01:08:39.250
middle one, is equal to the
probability of the left and

01:08:39.250 --> 01:08:40.550
the right given the middle.

01:08:40.550 --> 01:08:45.859
It says that the past and the
future, given the present, are

01:08:45.859 --> 01:08:48.439
independent of each other.

01:08:48.439 --> 01:08:51.180
It says that as soon as you
know what the present is,

01:08:51.180 --> 01:08:53.250
everything down there
is independent of

01:08:53.250 --> 01:08:56.100
everything up there.

01:08:56.100 --> 01:08:57.465
That's a pretty powerful
condition.

01:09:00.490 --> 01:09:04.390
And you'll see that we can do an
awful lot with it, so it's

01:09:04.390 --> 01:09:06.420
going to be important.

01:09:06.420 --> 01:09:06.770
OK.

01:09:06.770 --> 01:09:11.760
So let's go on with that.

01:09:11.760 --> 01:09:13.109
By Bayes rule--

01:09:13.109 --> 01:09:17.439
and incidentally, this is why
Bayes got into so much trouble

01:09:17.439 --> 01:09:20.229
with the other statisticians
in the world.

01:09:20.229 --> 01:09:22.910
Because the other statisticians
in the world

01:09:22.910 --> 01:09:28.870
really got emotionally upset at
the idea of talking about

01:09:28.870 --> 01:09:31.630
the past given the future.

01:09:31.630 --> 01:09:36.410
That was almost an attack on
their religion as well as all

01:09:36.410 --> 01:09:39.410
the mathematics they knew and
everything else they knew.

01:09:39.410 --> 01:09:44.420
It was really hitting them below
the belt, so to speak.

01:09:44.420 --> 01:09:47.939
So they didn't like this.

01:09:47.939 --> 01:09:51.600
But now, we've recognized that
Bayes' Law is just the

01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:56.540
consequence of the axioms of
probability, and there's

01:09:56.540 --> 01:09:58.330
nothing strange about it.

01:09:58.330 --> 01:10:00.930
You write down these conditional
probabilities and

01:10:00.930 --> 01:10:04.150
that's sitting there,
facing you.

01:10:04.150 --> 01:10:08.950
But what it says here is that
the probability of the state

01:10:08.950 --> 01:10:13.890
at time n minus 1, given the
state of time n, is equal to

01:10:13.890 --> 01:10:17.280
the probability of the state
of time n, given n minus 1,

01:10:17.280 --> 01:10:21.860
times the probability of X
n minus 1 divided by the

01:10:21.860 --> 01:10:23.260
probability of X n.

01:10:23.260 --> 01:10:26.450
In other words, you put this
over in this side, and it says

01:10:26.450 --> 01:10:30.310
the probability of X n times the
probability of X n minus 1

01:10:30.310 --> 01:10:33.870
given X n is that probability
up there.

01:10:33.870 --> 01:10:37.780
It says that the probability
of A given B times the

01:10:37.780 --> 01:10:40.870
probability of B is equal to the
probability of A times the

01:10:40.870 --> 01:10:45.920
probability of B given A. And
that's just the definition of

01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:49.930
a conditional probability,
nothing more.

01:10:49.930 --> 01:10:50.630
OK.

01:10:50.630 --> 01:10:54.950
If the forward chain is in
a steady state, then the

01:10:54.950 --> 01:10:59.610
probability that X sub n minus
1 equals j, given X sub n

01:10:59.610 --> 01:11:06.670
equals i, is pji times pi sub
j divided by pi sub i.

01:11:06.670 --> 01:11:10.510
These probabilities become
just probabilities which

01:11:10.510 --> 01:11:13.990
depend on i but not on n.

01:11:13.990 --> 01:11:17.550
Now what's going on here is
when you look at this

01:11:17.550 --> 01:11:24.370
equation, it looks peculiar
because normally with a Markov

01:11:24.370 --> 01:11:29.360
chain, we start out at time 0
with some assumed probability

01:11:29.360 --> 01:11:31.020
distribution.

01:11:31.020 --> 01:11:34.340
And as soon as you start out
with some assumed probability

01:11:34.340 --> 01:11:42.890
distribution at time 0 and you
start talking about the past

01:11:42.890 --> 01:11:47.830
condition on the future,
it gets very sticky.

01:11:47.830 --> 01:11:53.550
Because when you talk about
the past condition on the

01:11:53.550 --> 01:11:57.170
future, you can only go back to
time equals 0, and you know

01:11:57.170 --> 01:11:59.650
what's happening down there
because you have some

01:11:59.650 --> 01:12:04.080
established probabilities
at 0.

01:12:04.080 --> 01:12:10.330
So what it says is in this
equation here, it says that

01:12:10.330 --> 01:12:14.950
the Markov chain, defined
by this rule--

01:12:14.950 --> 01:12:16.590
I guess I ought to back
and look at the

01:12:16.590 --> 01:12:18.160
previous slide for that.

01:12:22.900 --> 01:12:28.050
This is saying the probability
of the state at time n minus

01:12:28.050 --> 01:12:32.300
1, conditional on the entire
future, is equal to the

01:12:32.300 --> 01:12:36.020
probability of X sub n minus
1 just given X sub n.

01:12:36.020 --> 01:12:39.340
This is the Markov condition,
but it's the Markov condition

01:12:39.340 --> 01:12:40.610
turned around.

01:12:40.610 --> 01:12:45.160
Usually we talk about the next
state given the previous state

01:12:45.160 --> 01:12:46.770
and everything before that.

01:12:46.770 --> 01:12:49.740
Here, we're talking about
the previous state given

01:12:49.740 --> 01:12:51.720
everything after that.

01:12:51.720 --> 01:12:55.820
So this really is the Markov
condition on what we might

01:12:55.820 --> 01:12:58.060
view as a backward chain.

01:12:58.060 --> 01:13:05.040
But to be a Markov chain, these
transition probabilities

01:13:05.040 --> 01:13:08.230
have to be independent of n.

01:13:08.230 --> 01:13:11.360
The transition probabilities
are not going to be

01:13:11.360 --> 01:13:16.690
independent of n if you have
these arbitrary probabilities

01:13:16.690 --> 01:13:19.295
at time 0 lousing
everything up.

01:13:19.295 --> 01:13:22.200
So you can get around
this in two ways.

01:13:22.200 --> 01:13:25.490
One way to get around it is
to say let's restrict our

01:13:25.490 --> 01:13:31.390
attention to positive recurrent
processes which are

01:13:31.390 --> 01:13:33.660
starting out in a
steady state.

01:13:33.660 --> 01:13:36.740
And if we start out in a steady
state, then these

01:13:36.740 --> 01:13:38.030
probabilities here--

01:13:41.180 --> 01:13:44.400
looking at these probabilities
here--

01:13:44.400 --> 01:13:47.270
if you go from here down to
here, you'll find out that

01:13:47.270 --> 01:13:49.720
this does not depend on n.

01:13:49.720 --> 01:13:53.740
And if you have an initial state
which is something other

01:13:53.740 --> 01:13:57.800
than steady state, then these
will depend on it.

01:13:57.800 --> 01:14:03.340
Let me put this down in
the next chain up.

01:14:03.340 --> 01:14:08.780
The probability of X sub n minus
1 given X sub n is going

01:14:08.780 --> 01:14:14.410
to be independent of n if this
is independent of n, which it

01:14:14.410 --> 01:14:18.070
is, because we have a
homogeneous Markov chain.

01:14:18.070 --> 01:14:21.490
And this is independent of n and
this is independent of n.

01:14:21.490 --> 01:14:27.380
Now, this will just be the
probability of pi sub i if X

01:14:27.380 --> 01:14:29.730
sub n minus 1 is equal to i.

01:14:29.730 --> 01:14:33.540
And this will be pi sub i if
probability of X sub n is

01:14:33.540 --> 01:14:34.430
equal to i.

01:14:34.430 --> 01:14:40.810
So this and this will be
independent of n if in fact we

01:14:40.810 --> 01:14:42.730
start out in a steady state.

01:14:42.730 --> 01:14:44.580
In other words, it won't be.

01:14:44.580 --> 01:14:49.500
So what we're doing here is we
normally think of a Markov

01:14:49.500 --> 01:14:54.050
chain starting out at time 0
because how else can you get

01:14:54.050 --> 01:14:55.950
it started?

01:14:55.950 --> 01:15:00.310
And we think of it in forward
time, and then we say, well,

01:15:00.310 --> 01:15:02.580
we want to make it homogeneous,
because we want

01:15:02.580 --> 01:15:06.100
to make it always do the same
thing in the future otherwise

01:15:06.100 --> 01:15:09.290
it doesn't really look much
like the a Markov chain.

01:15:09.290 --> 01:15:12.610
So what we're saying is that
this backward chain-- we have

01:15:12.610 --> 01:15:15.680
backward probabilities
defined now--

01:15:15.680 --> 01:15:20.870
the backward probabilities are
homogeneous if the forward

01:15:20.870 --> 01:15:23.520
probabilities start
in a steady state.

01:15:23.520 --> 01:15:26.600
You could probably make a
similar statement but say the

01:15:26.600 --> 01:15:30.290
forward probabilities are
homogeneous if the backward

01:15:30.290 --> 01:15:32.070
probabilities start
in a steady state.

01:15:32.070 --> 01:15:34.510
But I don't know when you're
going to start.

01:15:34.510 --> 01:15:38.160
You're going to have to start it
sometime in the future, and

01:15:38.160 --> 01:15:40.880
that gets too philosophical
to understand.

01:15:40.880 --> 01:15:42.130
OK.

01:15:43.980 --> 01:15:46.730
If we think of the chain as
starting in a steady state at

01:15:46.730 --> 01:15:50.150
time minus infinity, these are
also the equations of the

01:15:50.150 --> 01:15:52.250
homogeneous Markov chain.

01:15:52.250 --> 01:15:54.930
We can start at time minus
infinity wherever we want to--

01:15:54.930 --> 01:15:56.550
it doesn't make any
difference--

01:15:56.550 --> 01:15:59.780
because by the time we get to
state 0, we will be in steady

01:15:59.780 --> 01:16:03.380
state, and the whole range of
where we want to look at

01:16:03.380 --> 01:16:06.020
things will be in
steady state.

01:16:06.020 --> 01:16:07.360
OK.

01:16:07.360 --> 01:16:12.480
So aside from this issue about
starting at 0 and steady state

01:16:12.480 --> 01:16:17.420
and things like that, what we've
really shown here is

01:16:17.420 --> 01:16:21.810
that you can look at a Markov
chain either going forward or

01:16:21.810 --> 01:16:23.840
going backward.

01:16:23.840 --> 01:16:28.180
Or look at it going rightward
or going leftward.

01:16:28.180 --> 01:16:31.510
And that's really pretty
important.

01:16:31.510 --> 01:16:32.210
OK.

01:16:32.210 --> 01:16:34.380
That still doesn't say anything
about it being

01:16:34.380 --> 01:16:36.960
reversible.

01:16:36.960 --> 01:16:39.250
What reversibility is--

01:16:39.250 --> 01:16:42.050
it comes from looking at
this equation here.

01:16:42.050 --> 01:16:45.010
This says what the transition
probabilities are, going

01:16:45.010 --> 01:16:49.570
backwards, and this
is the transition

01:16:49.570 --> 01:16:51.450
probabilities going forward.

01:16:51.450 --> 01:16:53.140
These are the steady state
probabilities.

01:16:55.730 --> 01:17:05.540
And if we define P star of ji
as a backward transition

01:17:05.540 --> 01:17:06.320
probabilities--

01:17:06.320 --> 01:17:10.750
namely, the probability that at
this time or in stage A--

01:17:10.750 --> 01:17:14.430
given that in this next time,
which to us, is the previous

01:17:14.430 --> 01:17:18.510
time, we're in state i, is the
probability of going in a

01:17:18.510 --> 01:17:21.270
backward direction
from j to i.

01:17:24.970 --> 01:17:29.105
This gets into whether this is
P star of ij or P star of ij.

01:17:29.105 --> 01:17:32.770
But I did check it carefully,
so it has to be right.

01:17:32.770 --> 01:17:39.400
So anyway, when you substitute
this in for this, the

01:17:39.400 --> 01:17:44.630
conditions that you get is pi
sub i times P star of ij is

01:17:44.630 --> 01:17:48.040
equal to pi j times P of ji.

01:17:48.040 --> 01:17:50.515
These are the same equations
that we had for

01:17:50.515 --> 01:17:52.380
a birth-death chain.

01:17:52.380 --> 01:17:55.490
But now, we're not talking
about birth-death chains.

01:17:55.490 --> 01:17:59.710
Now we're talking about
any old chain.

01:17:59.710 --> 01:18:00.533
Yeah?

01:18:00.533 --> 01:18:04.397
AUDIENCE: Doesn't this only
make sense for positive

01:18:04.397 --> 01:18:09.196
recurring chains?

01:18:09.196 --> 01:18:11.591
PROFESSOR: Yes.

01:18:11.591 --> 01:18:12.070
Sorry.

01:18:12.070 --> 01:18:15.450
I should keep emphasizing that,
because it only makes

01:18:15.450 --> 01:18:18.450
sense when you can define the
steady state probabilities.

01:18:18.450 --> 01:18:19.850
Yes.

01:18:19.850 --> 01:18:24.130
The steady state probabilities
are necessary in order to even

01:18:24.130 --> 01:18:26.720
define this P star of ji.

01:18:26.720 --> 01:18:31.070
But once you have that steady
state condition, and once you

01:18:31.070 --> 01:18:33.770
know what the steady state
probabilities are, then you

01:18:33.770 --> 01:18:35.970
can calculate backward
probabilities, you can

01:18:35.970 --> 01:18:39.540
calculate forward probabilities,
and this is a

01:18:39.540 --> 01:18:42.300
very simple relationship
that they satisfy.

01:18:42.300 --> 01:18:47.260
It makes sense because this
is a normal form.

01:18:47.260 --> 01:18:51.420
You look at state transition
probabilities and you look at

01:18:51.420 --> 01:18:53.960
the probability of being in
one state and then the

01:18:53.960 --> 01:18:57.250
probability of going
to the next state.

01:18:57.250 --> 01:18:59.680
And the question is the
next state back there

01:18:59.680 --> 01:19:01.020
or is it over there?

01:19:01.020 --> 01:19:06.130
And if it's a star, then it
means it's back there.

01:19:06.130 --> 01:19:11.670
And then we define a chain as
being reversible if P star of

01:19:11.670 --> 01:19:18.370
ij is equal to P sub ij,
for all i and all j.

01:19:18.370 --> 01:19:21.340
And what that means is that
all birth-death chains are

01:19:21.340 --> 01:19:22.590
reversible.

01:19:24.640 --> 01:19:26.570
And now let me show you
what that means.

01:19:29.970 --> 01:19:34.290
If we look at arrivals and
departures for a birth-death

01:19:34.290 --> 01:19:38.610
change, sometimes you go in a
self loop, so you don't go up

01:19:38.610 --> 01:19:40.340
and you don't go down.

01:19:40.340 --> 01:19:43.350
Other times you either
go down or you go up.

01:19:43.350 --> 01:19:44.940
We have arrivals coming in.

01:19:44.940 --> 01:19:49.250
Arrivals correspond to upper
transitions, departures

01:19:49.250 --> 01:19:52.930
correspond to downward
transitions so that when you

01:19:52.930 --> 01:19:58.020
look at it in a normal way,
you start out at time 0.

01:19:58.020 --> 01:19:59.710
You're in state 0.

01:19:59.710 --> 01:20:02.800
You have an arrival.

01:20:02.800 --> 01:20:04.850
Nothing happens for a while.

01:20:04.850 --> 01:20:07.970
You have another arrival, but
this time, you have a

01:20:07.970 --> 01:20:12.110
departure, you have another
departure, and you wind up in

01:20:12.110 --> 01:20:13.360
state 0 again.

01:20:16.390 --> 01:20:21.010
As far states are concerned,
you go from

01:20:21.010 --> 01:20:23.440
state 0 to state 1.

01:20:23.440 --> 01:20:25.460
You stay in state 1.

01:20:25.460 --> 01:20:27.360
In other words, this is the
difference between arrivals

01:20:27.360 --> 01:20:27.510
and departures.

01:20:27.510 --> 01:20:29.570
This is what the state is.

01:20:29.570 --> 01:20:31.440
You stay in state 1.

01:20:31.440 --> 01:20:34.440
Then you go up and you get
another arrival, you get a

01:20:34.440 --> 01:20:37.160
departure, and then you
get a departure,

01:20:37.160 --> 01:20:38.790
according to this chain.

01:20:38.790 --> 01:20:43.070
Now, let's look at it
coming in this way.

01:20:43.070 --> 01:20:45.480
When we look at it
coming backwards

01:20:45.480 --> 01:20:47.970
in time, what happens?

01:20:47.970 --> 01:20:51.450
We're going along here,
we're in state 0,

01:20:51.450 --> 01:20:55.070
suddenly we move up.

01:20:55.070 --> 01:21:01.130
If we want to view this as a
backward moving Markov chain,

01:21:01.130 --> 01:21:04.660
this corresponds to an
arrival of something.

01:21:04.660 --> 01:21:07.470
This corresponds to
another arrival.

01:21:07.470 --> 01:21:09.710
This corresponds
to a departure.

01:21:09.710 --> 01:21:12.720
We go along here with nothing
else happening, we get another

01:21:12.720 --> 01:21:16.180
departure, and there we are back
in a steady state again.

01:21:19.210 --> 01:21:23.280
And for any birth-death
chain, we can do this.

01:21:23.280 --> 01:21:29.120
Because any birth-death chain
we can look at as an arrival

01:21:29.120 --> 01:21:31.100
and departure process.

01:21:31.100 --> 01:21:34.140
We have arrivals, we
have departures--

01:21:34.140 --> 01:21:35.900
we might have states
that go negative.

01:21:35.900 --> 01:21:39.450
That would be rather awkward,
but we can have that.

01:21:39.450 --> 01:21:45.330
But now, if we know that these
steady state probabilities

01:21:45.330 --> 01:21:48.510
govern the probability of
arrivals and the probabilities

01:21:48.510 --> 01:21:53.620
of departures, if we know that
we have reversibility, then

01:21:53.620 --> 01:21:57.360
these events here have the
same probability as these

01:21:57.360 --> 01:21:59.620
events here.

01:21:59.620 --> 01:22:02.800
It means that when we look at
things going from right back

01:22:02.800 --> 01:22:07.140
to left, it means that the
things that we viewed as

01:22:07.140 --> 01:22:11.170
departures here look
like arrivals.

01:22:11.170 --> 01:22:13.730
And what we're going to do next
time is use that to prove

01:22:13.730 --> 01:22:19.950
Burke's Theorem, which says
using this idea that if you

01:22:19.950 --> 01:22:25.210
look at the process of
departures in a birth-death

01:22:25.210 --> 01:22:29.130
chain where arrivals are all
with probability P and

01:22:29.130 --> 01:22:32.590
departures are all with
probability Q, then you get

01:22:32.590 --> 01:22:37.600
this nice set of probabilities
for arrivals and departures.

01:22:37.600 --> 01:22:41.380
Arrivals are independent
of everything else--

01:22:41.380 --> 01:22:43.960
same probability at every
unit of time.

01:22:43.960 --> 01:22:45.950
Departures are the same way.

01:22:45.950 --> 01:22:49.680
But when you're looking from
left to right, you can only

01:22:49.680 --> 01:22:54.000
get departures when your state
is greater than 0.

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:58.680
When you're coming in looking
this way, these things that

01:22:58.680 --> 01:23:03.220
looked like departures before
are looking like arrivals.

01:23:03.220 --> 01:23:08.240
These arrivals form a Bernoulli
Process, and the

01:23:08.240 --> 01:23:13.110
Bernoulli Process says that
given the future, the

01:23:13.110 --> 01:23:17.630
probability of a departure,
at any instant of time, is

01:23:17.630 --> 01:23:18.995
independent of everything
in the future.

01:23:23.120 --> 01:23:25.920
Now, that is not intuitive.

01:23:25.920 --> 01:23:28.960
If you think it's intuitive,
go back and think again.

01:23:28.960 --> 01:23:30.550
Because it's not.

01:23:30.550 --> 01:23:33.350
But anyway, I'm going
to stop here.

01:23:33.350 --> 01:23:35.400
You have this to mull over.

01:23:35.400 --> 01:23:38.500
We will try to sort it out
a little more next time.

01:23:38.500 --> 01:23:40.880
This is something that's going
to take your cooperation to

01:23:40.880 --> 01:23:42.130
sort it out, also.

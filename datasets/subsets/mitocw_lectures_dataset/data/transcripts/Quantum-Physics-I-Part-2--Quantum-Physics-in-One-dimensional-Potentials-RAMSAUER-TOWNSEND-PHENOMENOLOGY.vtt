00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.610
PROFESSOR: If you have
potential transmission

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:08.230
coefficient for
a potential where

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:13.620
z0 is equal to 13 pi over 4.

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.930
That's a square well
of certain depth,

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.830
and we represent it in this way.

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:32.130
Remember n must be greater
than or equal than 2z0 over pi.

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.930
So this will be 13/2.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:44.190
And 13/2 means that we can start
with n equals 7, 8, 9, and all

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.550
those.

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:51.880
Remember, this n counts
which bound state

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.290
of the infinite square
well you're talking about.

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:59.830
And the energy that you
must use are your integers,

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:01.490
are positive energy.

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:07.650
So positive energies mean that
you have sufficiently large n,

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:14.040
and the n that this sufficiently
large is 7 in this case.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:22.640
So you can then determine
from this formula what

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.920
is the value of e n over v0.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:39.283
So for example E7 over v0
turns out to be 0.15976.

00:01:39.283 --> 00:01:47.120
E8 over v0 turns
out to be 0.514793.

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:53.060
And E9 over v0 is 0.91716.

00:01:53.060 --> 00:02:04.730
So if you plot it, you have here
E, or capital energy, over v0.

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:10.460
And you want to plug the
transmission probability.

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:12.410
And it begins with 0.

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.650
That was the question
a second ago.

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.860
And then it may reach 1.

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.230
And it will reach 1 at
each one of those values.

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.710
So if, here is 1, 0.15.

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:40.690
There will be 0.15,
0.51, and 0.92.

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.900
So you get this, and here
another one, and here

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:44.680
another one.

00:02:51.244 --> 00:02:52.160
Probability like that.

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:03.360
So that's a typical graph for
the transmission probability.

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:11.460
It oscillates, and it
reaches 1 at several points

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:12.310
forever and ever.

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.230
And the amplitude
become smaller,

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.370
so it's really
overall tending to 1.

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.520
So these two people
we're talking about,

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:26.520
Ramsauer and Townsend.

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:34.710
They lived from 1860s
to 1940s and '50s.

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:41.500
And they did their famous
experiment in 1921.

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:47.250
So their experiment
was elastic scattering

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:53.610
of low energy electrons
off of rare gas atoms.

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:59.910
So Ramsauer and
Townsend, in 1921,

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:04.980
they scattered elastically.

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.720
That means the particles
didn't change their identities.

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.640
They didn't create
more particles.

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.089
It was just electrons came
in and electrons went out.

00:04:19.089 --> 00:04:22.500
Electrons.

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:31.010
And these are low
energy electrons,

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:38.550
off of rare gas atoms.

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.860
So these are noble gases.

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:48.880
Their shells are
completely filled.

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:54.190
And they're rather inert, very
unreactive, high ionization

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:57.400
energies, no low
energy states you

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.100
can scatter these atoms into.

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:03.670
So basically very
unreactive atom.

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:10.720
And you can imagine it as a
very beautiful spherical cloud.

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:12.190
We can draw some
electrons, there's

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:17.060
some protons, a nucleus
here, and an electron cloud.

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:20.050
So how does this
look to an electron?

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:23.730
Well, you know
from electrostatics

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:26.800
that if you have total charge
0 and it's totally spherically

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.560
symmetric, no electric
field outside.

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:34.570
So the electron comes
in, feels nothing.

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:39.190
And as soon as you penetrate
this, at any point here,

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:41.940
the electric field points in.

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:44.620
Or, well, it
actually points out,

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:48.850
but the electron
will feel a force in.

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:52.840
Because the charge
in the outside

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:56.100
shell doesn't produce any field.

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:59.650
But now, the protons
in the nucleus

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:01.810
beat the effect
of the electrons.

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:08.700
So there's a force in, a
force in, that goes in.

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:15.990
So basically this is like a deep
square well, or spherical well,

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:17.390
representing the atom.

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:20.670
The atom can be some
sort of spherical well

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:25.680
that attracts the electrons.

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:31.430
So what these people did were
throwing these electrons.

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:34.670
And they considered that
this electron scattered

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:38.840
a lot when they bounced back.

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:41.220
On the other hand,
if they continued,

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:49.190
if the electrons pass by, they
said nothing has happened.

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:54.410
So the reflection coefficient
for them, the reflection

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:55.160
coefficient.

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:08.810
Reflection coefficient
is a proxy,

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:18.820
a good representation for
the scattering cross-section.

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:32.260
So the reflection coefficient,
what they found experimentally

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:37.780
was a reflection coefficient,
R, that as a function of energy

00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:40.690
was very high.

00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:43.510
And people thought
at this moment, OK,

00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:47.050
these are like particles
colliding with particles.

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:49.930
Their energies shouldn't make
much difference, you know.

00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:53.950
You either collide or you don't
collide, and you bounce back

00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:56.650
or you don't bounce back.

00:07:56.650 --> 00:08:00.870
So they thought that
this would be flat.

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:06.070
But nevertheless, it actually
went down enormously,

00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:08.980
and then it went up again.

00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:14.980
So they found that for
electrons with about 1 Ev,

00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:18.850
that's very low
energy electrons,

00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:21.060
but they were going pretty fast.

00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:25.480
And E1, Ev electron is
going like at 600 kilometers

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:26.080
per second.

00:08:29.090 --> 00:08:33.770
So the reflection
was going like this.

00:08:33.770 --> 00:08:38.350
And they had no explanation
why it was so sensitive

00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:43.390
with energy, and why there would
be a funny effect going on,

00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:46.930
that the reflection
would suddenly go down,

00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:50.800
and just basically the
particles would get transmitted.

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:55.570
But if you think of reflection
here as a continuous line

00:08:55.570 --> 00:08:58.550
and transmission
as a dotted line,

00:08:58.550 --> 00:09:02.740
the transmission that must
alter the reflection to be 1

00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:12.150
would be going up here and
would have reached near 1

00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:14.990
at this value of the energy.

00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:19.450
So the explanation
eventually was this effect,

00:09:19.450 --> 00:09:22.050
that you should
do well and there

00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:26.860
is a resonant effect in the
well, and for some energies

00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:30.700
the resonance is such that it
allows the particles to just go

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:33.190
through and not scatter.

00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:37.300
So this had to wait some time,
because the experiment was done

00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:42.100
in 1921, and Schrodinger
and everybody started

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:48.320
doing good work in 1925, and
of wave mechanics took a while.

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:53.230
But eventually it was
recognized that basically it's

00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:57.310
resonant transmission,
what is happening there.

00:09:57.310 --> 00:10:00.130
Well, if you want to
get the numbers right,

00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:03.010
if you want to get
that Ev better, you

00:10:03.010 --> 00:10:08.830
have to do a spherical model of
the square, finite square well,

00:10:08.830 --> 00:10:12.310
you have this spherical
well, and do it a little more

00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:12.960
precisely.

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:16.200
But then the agreement
is pretty reasonable.

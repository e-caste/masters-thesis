00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:05.780
Let's consider a
very simple example

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:10.310
of a runner in which our
position function x of t

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:13.150
is given as a quadratic
function in time.

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:16.350
It will be a constant
b times t squared.

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.940
Here, b is a constant.

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:20.820
Now it's always
important in SI units

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.200
to consider what the
units of this constant is.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.400
Because a position function
is measured in meters

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.980
and time is measured in
seconds, b is a constant

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.170
and it has units of
meters per second squared.

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.470
And there's an
example of a runner--

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:40.210
and let's make a plot of
that position function.

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.370
So we're going to plot x
of t as a function of time.

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.920
b here-- let's make b
a positive constant.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.100
And so our function looks
something like that.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.400
Now, the velocity-- component of
the velocity-- remember v of t

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.660
is given by dx dt
of this function.

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.540
And the derivative of
a polynomial t squared

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:04.500
is very simple.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.080
That's just simply 2b times t.

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.630
Again, let's look at our units.

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.100
Because b has the units of
meters per second squared,

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.920
and when multiplying
that by second,

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.470
we have the units of velocity in
SI units as meters per second.

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:23.170
Now let's plot that function.

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.970
Notice this is a
linear function.

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:33.930
And so if I plotted
underneath here, the velocity

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:41.590
as a function of time, it
starts off with a zero slope.

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:47.250
Remember we're looking-- our
velocity at any given time

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.280
corresponds to the slope of a
tangent line to the position

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.900
function.

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.660
And you can see that
slope is increasing.

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:59.240
Now you wouldn't know
it from this graph,

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.330
but if you did plot t squared,
it's increasing linearly.

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.950
And so our velocity
function-- the initial slope

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.490
is 0 at t equal 0, and it's
increasing linearly in time.

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:13.560
So we'll just draw that
as some linear function.

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.730
And the slope here
of this function

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.540
will be now the acceleration.

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:25.340
So a of t is the derivative of
the component of the velocity

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.240
function as a function of time.

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.510
And this derivative
is quite easy.

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.240
It's just simply 2 b.

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.079
Now notice those have
the units of meters

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:40.250
per second squared, which
are units for acceleration.

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.760
When we, again,
look at the slope,

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.140
notice that at
every single point,

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:55.170
the slope of the velocity as a
function of time is a constant.

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.420
The slope here is
just equal to 2b.

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:05.510
And so now if we plotted
our acceleration function,

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:09.180
we have this point 2 b,
and every single point

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.790
has the same value
of acceleration.

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.420
So here the acceleration
is an example

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.400
of constant acceleration.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.770
And this is our simplest case.

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:24.750
Notice we started with
the position function.

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.660
We differentiate to get the
component of the velocity

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.520
and to get the component
of the acceleration.

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:33.870
So this is a very simple
model for a runner

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.079
whose increasing speed
linearly, accelerating

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:39.788
at a constant rate.

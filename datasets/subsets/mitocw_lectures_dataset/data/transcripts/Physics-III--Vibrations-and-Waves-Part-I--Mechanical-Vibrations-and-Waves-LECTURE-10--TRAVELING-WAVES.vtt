00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:28.170
PROFESSOR: OK, welcome
back, everybody, to 8.03.

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.540
Today we are going to continue
the discussion of wave equation

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.360
starting from last lecture.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:38.930
So what have we
learned last time?

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:45.330
As a reminder, we have started
to study the behavior of a wave

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:46.680
equation.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:54.700
We understood basic behavior
of the wave equation,

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:58.800
and also are trying to solve
the general solution of the wave

00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:59.860
equation.

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:01.440
The first thing
which we learned,

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.900
as usual, is the normal modes.

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.210
What are the normal
modes in the case

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.880
of wave equation over continuous
translations in metric system.

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.180
What we found last time is
that they are standing waves.

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:21.990
And of course, as usual,
the full solution,

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.370
which is a general
description of this system,

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:29.820
is the superposition of
infinite number of normal modes.

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.850
And that means
one can understand

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.990
this kind of system
systematically

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.980
the using Fourier series.

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:40.560
So this is just a reminder.

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.010
So what we have done
is that basically we

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:48.490
start with infinite number
of coupled oscillators.

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:54.120
And we make the space
between those massive objects

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.910
in the system
smaller and smaller

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:59.510
until it become
continuous, right?

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:03.440
And a very interesting
thing happened

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:08.139
that automatically already
give you wave equations, OK?

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:09.539
Which is as you're shown here.

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.750
Last time, as I mentioned, we
discussed the normal modes,

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.010
which are standing waves.

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:22.685
Those are the first
few normal modes,

00:02:22.685 --> 00:02:27.270
and those are the functional
form of the normal modes, which

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:28.450
are standing waves.

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.670
So the structure
just looks like this.

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.890
So you have A m, which
is the amplitude, sin k

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.610
m x plus alpha m,
which can be determined

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.490
by boundary conditions.

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:44.410
And the sin omega
m t plus beta m,

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.600
that means all the
points in the system

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.000
are oscillating at the
same frequency, omega m,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.330
and as the same phase,
which is beta m.

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.680
And those are based
on the wave equation.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.410
If you plug this solution
back into the equation,

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:05.680
you will find that omega m is
actually not a free parameter.

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:11.370
It's actually proportional
to k m, which is the wave

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.100
number of m's normal mode.

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:18.930
And this constant of v p,
we will find out today,

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.010
this is actually the
speed of the wave

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:24.955
in the case of traveling wave.

00:03:24.955 --> 00:03:28.440
And if you look at the
individual normal modes

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.180
and make product of those normal
mode as a function of time,

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.570
you can see from here there
are six different normal modes.

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:40.430
And they are like a sinusoidal
shape in terms of amplitude

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:45.070
as a functional
position on the string.

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:48.590
And there you can see
that if you distort

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:52.770
the string more, then you get
a higher oscillation frequency,

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:58.610
as you see from m equal to
1 to m equals to 6 case.

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:01.520
So as I mentioned
today, we will talk

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:05.860
about another interesting
kind of solution, which is

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:08.680
progressing wave solution, OK?

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.490
Why is this solution exciting?

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:15.370
Not just because
this actually matches

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:18.790
what we actually already
learned about waves, right?

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:22.630
And this solution
should enable us

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:26.620
to send, for example,
energy from one point

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:27.590
to another point.

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:29.540
This is actually what
I am doing now, right?

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:33.460
I'm sending energy from
my mouth to your ear

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.730
so that you can hear what I
have been talking about, right?

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:39.370
About 8.03, right?

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:40.360
So that's really cool.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:45.670
And we will try to
understand how actually we

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:50.890
can get this solution out of
this strange wave equation, OK?

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:52.780
So what is showing here
is the normal mode.

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:57.310
And we are going to talk about
a second kind of solution,

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:01.360
which is the progressing
wave solution.

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:06.376
And this solution have
this form, psi (x, t)

00:05:06.376 --> 00:05:11.260
will be equal to some
kind of function, f.

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:18.130
And this is actually a function
of x minus v p times t.

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:23.990
This is actually a general
form of the progressing wave.

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:29.220
And f function is some kind
of well-behaved function

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:31.790
of your choice.

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:35.230
OK, so the first thing
which I would like to do

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:40.900
is to show that this functional
form is actually the solution

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:42.620
of the wave equation, right?

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:44.290
So fairly straightforward.

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:48.580
We can actually go ahead and
plug them into this equation.

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:57.321
And before that, I will define
tau to be x minus v p times t,

00:05:57.321 --> 00:05:57.820
OK?

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:02.385
So in order to
prepare for plugging

00:06:02.385 --> 00:06:07.090
in this functional form
to a wave equation,

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:11.110
I would calculate
using chain law.

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:16.500
Partial f partial x will
be equal to partial f,

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:17.815
partial tau.

00:06:17.815 --> 00:06:21.310
Partial tau, partial x.

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:27.070
And this will give you
partial f, partial tau times,

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:33.100
in this case, partial tau,
partial x will give you 1, OK?

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:41.800
And that will give
you f prime tau, OK?

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:43.900
Therefore we can go
ahead and calculate

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:50.170
as well partial square
f, partial x squared, OK?

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:56.390
That will give you
f double prime tau.

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:58.390
So this is actually the
first set of equation

00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:03.910
I need in order to describe
the right side of the wave

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:05.880
equation.

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:10.260
The other equation which I need
in the preparation for plugging

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:13.640
in the whole thing
into the wave equation

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:18.460
is to calculate
partial f, partial t.

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:21.170
And according to
chain law, partial f,

00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:25.630
partial t is equal to partial
f, partial tau, partial tau,

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:28.780
partial t.

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:33.520
In this case, f is actually
a function of x minus v p t,

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:37.390
and tau is defined
as x minus v p t.

00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:40.030
Therefore you can actually
immediately conclude

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:42.670
that these would
be equal to minus v

00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:47.110
p, partial f, partial tau.

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:51.606
And now it is actually
equal to minus v p f prime.

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:58.180
Similarly, you can
calculate partial square

00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:01.930
of f, partial t squared,
and that would give you

00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:05.474
a v p squared f prime.

00:08:05.474 --> 00:08:10.960
Oh, f double prime because we
did the double differential.

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:12.940
OK, all right.

00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:18.540
So from the first equation
and second equation,

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:21.810
which I have on the board,
we can actually plug that

00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:24.710
into the wave equation.

00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:29.820
And what I'm going to get is
partial square f, partial t

00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:30.580
square.

00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:35.676
That would be equal to v p
square, partial square f,

00:08:35.676 --> 00:08:38.360
partial x square.

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:47.390
So that is actually exactly
the wave equation, which

00:08:47.390 --> 00:08:49.220
we showed from the beginning.

00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:56.580
So that means this functional
form satisfy the wave equation.

00:08:56.580 --> 00:09:01.860
And I didn't even specify
what is actually f function.

00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:05.850
f function is some kind
of well-behaved function.

00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:11.010
And it can have all kinds
of different shape, which

00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:12.880
we will discuss later.

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:14.750
But that is actually
pretty encouraging.

00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:19.210
And that means if you
try to distort the string

00:09:19.210 --> 00:09:25.485
and if this shape is
actually propagating at--

00:09:25.485 --> 00:09:29.634
have the functional
form of x minus--

00:09:29.634 --> 00:09:31.800
If you have any function
which you have a functional

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:35.490
form of f of x minus Vpt--

00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:40.740
no matter what kind of shape it
is, this shape is going to be--

00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:43.960
first of all, this function is
a solution to the wave equation.

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:46.140
Secondly, we will show
you that this shape

00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:50.820
is going to be propagating
at the speed of Vp.

00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:52.500
And the shape will not change.

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:56.970
It will stay like that forever
according to the wave equation.

00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:03.630
There's another
function of form which

00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:09.750
can also be the functional
form of the progressing wave.

00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:17.820
We usually write it as f
KX plus or minus omega t.

00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:25.320
And in this case if omega
is actually Vp times k,

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:28.860
which is actually
already required

00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:32.780
from the discussion
of normal modes.

00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:37.280
Then this equation-- this
kind of functional form

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:43.190
is also the solution
of wave equation.

00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:46.440
And of course you can actually
go ahead and prove that

00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:50.010
probably after the lecture.

00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:53.194
The proof will be very similar
to what we have done here.

00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:59.910
So now, actually
try to understand

00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:03.400
what does this function mean?

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:09.370
So I have a function which
is f of x minus Vp times t.

00:11:09.370 --> 00:11:12.745
Where x is actually
the position of the--

00:11:12.745 --> 00:11:13.920
on the string.

00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:18.040
And the t is actually the time,
which I go ahead and check

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:20.800
this function.

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:25.140
And for example, if I
can give you an example--

00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:27.990
a function, for
example, I can make it

00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:30.850
like a triangular
shape like this.

00:11:30.850 --> 00:11:36.510
And this is actually plotted
as a function of Tau.

00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:40.020
So f of Tau is
actually giving you

00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:44.870
the information of the shape
of the progressing wave.

00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:54.800
So let's discuss if I
write f of x minus Vt,

00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:57.820
what does that mean?

00:11:57.820 --> 00:12:02.560
OK, first of all, I
can take t equal to 0.

00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:06.450
What will what happen is
that a lot instants of time,

00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:10.850
t equal to 0, x is equal to Tau.

00:12:10.850 --> 00:12:18.650
That means at t equal to 0,
the shape of the string--

00:12:18.650 --> 00:12:20.690
well, it looks like
this-- like this function.

00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:30.220
Now, I would like to know how
this string is going to evolve

00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:31.630
as a function of time.

00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:35.160
So that's actually
all we care, right?

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:41.850
And that means I'm going to
increase t to a larger value.

00:12:41.850 --> 00:12:47.430
So suppose originally,
I have a t equal to 0,

00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:50.880
I'm sitting on this point.

00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:54.870
I sample the f at this position.

00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:59.050
If I increase t--

00:12:59.050 --> 00:13:03.550
if I increase t from 0
to a larger value where

00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:09.670
I will start to sample, will
I move to a left-hand side,

00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:11.170
or a right-hand side?

00:13:11.170 --> 00:13:13.060
Anybody can help me.

00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:16.600
Because this functional
form is actually x minus Vt.

00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:19.600
What will happen
if I increase t?

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:23.530
Tau will increase or decrease?

00:13:23.530 --> 00:13:24.797
AUDIENCE: Decrease.

00:13:24.797 --> 00:13:25.630
PROFESSOR: Decrease.

00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:25.930
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:13:25.930 --> 00:13:26.620
Move to the left.

00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:27.495
PROFESSOR: Very good.

00:13:27.495 --> 00:13:28.510
So decrease, right?

00:13:28.510 --> 00:13:33.350
So that means at the fixed x, I
am going to sample this point.

00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:37.480
What does that mean?

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:43.830
That means originally, if I
plot everything in terms of x--

00:13:43.830 --> 00:13:47.600
originally, it have this shape.

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:51.130
Now, if I increase t,
what is going to happen

00:13:51.130 --> 00:13:55.750
is that originally I was
sampling this shape here.

00:13:55.750 --> 00:13:58.760
And now I am sampling
the shape here.

00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:06.560
That means if t equal to t
prime, which is larger than t,

00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:10.650
this shape first of
all is unchanged.

00:14:10.650 --> 00:14:13.570
Secondly, it's actually moving.

00:14:13.570 --> 00:14:17.500
The shape looks like
as if it's moving

00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:20.410
in the horizontal direction.

00:14:20.410 --> 00:14:24.130
And the direction
of this movement

00:14:24.130 --> 00:14:27.010
is in the positive x direction.

00:14:27.010 --> 00:14:31.690
If I'd write my progressing
wave solution in a functional

00:14:31.690 --> 00:14:36.700
form of f of x minus Vt--

00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:38.930
this should be Vt
here, sorry for that.

00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:45.410
Any questions?

00:14:45.410 --> 00:14:46.790
So look at what we have done.

00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:50.980
First of all, we
have proved that f

00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:54.730
of x minus Vpt, this
function of form

00:14:54.730 --> 00:14:58.260
is a solution to
the wave equation.

00:14:58.260 --> 00:14:59.920
It's a solution.

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:02.590
Secondly, we also
discussed the property

00:15:02.590 --> 00:15:04.210
of this functional form.

00:15:04.210 --> 00:15:06.790
So that's essentially
describing a shape.

00:15:06.790 --> 00:15:09.920
And the whole shape
is going to move

00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:13.600
as if it's moving as
a function of time

00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:18.120
and to the positive x direction.

00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:20.810
So let me ask you
another question.

00:15:20.810 --> 00:15:24.230
So what will happen if
I write the solution

00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:29.720
in the form of f of x plus Vt?

00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:32.800
Anybody can help me
with the direction

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:35.481
of the propagation of the wave.

00:15:35.481 --> 00:15:36.522
AUDIENCE: Go to the left.

00:15:36.522 --> 00:15:37.188
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:15:37.188 --> 00:15:39.340
Go to the left-hand
side of the board.

00:15:39.340 --> 00:15:43.850
That means if I have
another expression.

00:15:43.850 --> 00:15:48.260
I'm using the same f function
which is defined here.

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:52.870
In this case, if I
write f of x plus Vt,

00:15:52.870 --> 00:15:56.480
that means the
shape will be moving

00:15:56.480 --> 00:16:00.440
in the negative x direction.

00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:01.910
It's symmetric.

00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:03.910
Of course you can
also discuss what

00:16:03.910 --> 00:16:06.320
will happen if you take
this functional form

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:14.488
and you are going to get
exactly the same conclusion.

00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:23.230
So right now I have been
talking about moving shape.

00:16:23.230 --> 00:16:27.660
So what is actually
really moving?

00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:30.190
Professor Lee, you
just told us before

00:16:30.190 --> 00:16:34.720
that every point on the string
can only move up and down.

00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:36.220
Now, you are talking
about something

00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:39.820
moving in the positive x
and negative x direction.

00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:43.010
What does that mean?

00:16:43.010 --> 00:16:46.360
So that mean-- take y example.

00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:51.970
So if I have a Gaussian
pulse, and I write this thing

00:16:51.970 --> 00:16:56.720
in the form of x minus Vt.

00:16:56.720 --> 00:17:02.130
At t equal to 0, this
shape looks like this.

00:17:02.130 --> 00:17:06.280
In the next moment,
if I increase time

00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:09.339
to t equal to 1, what
is going to happen

00:17:09.339 --> 00:17:16.170
is that this shape move toward
the positive x direction.

00:17:16.170 --> 00:17:20.260
And of course 0's
are the equilibrium

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:23.780
position of this waves--

00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:26.700
of the string.

00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:33.020
And what is happening is it's
like this-- so basically,

00:17:33.020 --> 00:17:37.950
all the points on the string
are really working together

00:17:37.950 --> 00:17:41.970
to produce this shifting--

00:17:41.970 --> 00:17:45.430
this progress Gaussian wave.

00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:49.770
So what is happening is that
if I focus on this point,

00:17:49.770 --> 00:17:51.480
this point will go down.

00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:55.170
And this point will go
down, go down, go down,

00:17:55.170 --> 00:17:58.230
until I touch this point.

00:17:58.230 --> 00:18:00.660
So basically, what
is happening is

00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:03.210
like this-- all the
points are only moving

00:18:03.210 --> 00:18:06.480
up and down horizontally.

00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:13.680
But they all move
in a manner such

00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:20.800
that if you look at just
the shape of the amplitude--

00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:23.350
the amplitude is
a function of x--

00:18:23.350 --> 00:18:27.280
it looks as if the
amplitude-- the shape

00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:32.140
is actually moving toward
positive x direction.

00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:36.380
Moving toward the right-hand
side of the board.

00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:38.510
So what is actually moving?

00:18:38.510 --> 00:18:43.160
What is moving is actually
all the point like mass

00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:43.940
on the string--

00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:46.070
they are only
moving up and done.

00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:50.090
But they are moving
together so nicely such

00:18:50.090 --> 00:18:53.750
that it looks as if the
whole shape is actually

00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:58.010
shifting toward the
positive x direction.

00:18:58.010 --> 00:18:59.590
Any questions so far?

00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:04.930
So I hope that's
straight forward enough.

00:19:04.930 --> 00:19:11.470
And I would like to discuss with
you a interesting situation.

00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:19.740
So we have learned
that, OK, I can have,

00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:23.520
for example, triangular pulse.

00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:26.520
And I can have this
triangular pulse moving

00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:30.350
in the positive x direction.

00:19:30.350 --> 00:19:34.000
And that we will also
find out that the speed

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:39.025
of the propagation is actually
Vp because that's actually

00:19:39.025 --> 00:19:44.970
if you increase t and that's
actually the speed of movement

00:19:44.970 --> 00:19:49.080
when you sample the
shape and the f of Tau.

00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:52.110
So therefore, we can
conclude that the speed

00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:58.770
of this triangular
pulse is going to be Vp.

00:19:58.770 --> 00:20:03.180
If I have another
triangular pulse starting

00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:06.600
from the right-hand
side end of the string,

00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:09.950
they have exactly the
same shape, exactly

00:20:09.950 --> 00:20:12.230
the same amplitude.

00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:21.790
So of course, according to
what we actually wrote there,

00:20:21.790 --> 00:20:24.540
they are going to move forever.

00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:29.250
And at some point they will
actually meet each other.

00:20:29.250 --> 00:20:32.460
And what is going to
happen is that you

00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:34.350
will have some pulse,
which is actually

00:20:34.350 --> 00:20:38.130
two times of the
shape at some point.

00:20:38.130 --> 00:20:44.220
Because of the linearity
of the wave equation.

00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:46.340
So that's actually
pretty straight forward.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:53.130
However, if I consider another
case, which is like this.

00:20:53.130 --> 00:20:55.580
So I have two progressing waves.

00:20:58.850 --> 00:21:02.120
One is actually going in the
right-hand side direction.

00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:05.220
The other one is going to
the left-hand side direction.

00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:09.410
They have exactly the same
shape, but they have--

00:21:09.410 --> 00:21:13.700
the amplitude is actually
taking the minus sign.

00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:17.610
So they actually are exactly--

00:21:17.610 --> 00:21:19.410
they have exactly
the same amplitude,

00:21:19.410 --> 00:21:22.180
but pointing to a
different direction.

00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:25.127
One is actually pointing upward.

00:21:25.127 --> 00:21:26.960
The other one is actually
pointing downward.

00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:37.440
So at some point these two waves
is going to overlap each other.

00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:45.070
When they overlap each other,
what is going to happen?

00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:51.240
It's like this-- they are
going to overlap each other.

00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:56.340
That means the amplitude will
be cancelling each other.

00:21:56.340 --> 00:22:01.840
Then from the experiment you
will see something like this.

00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:06.340
So now, this is the question
I would like to ask you.

00:22:06.340 --> 00:22:09.860
What will happen next?

00:22:09.860 --> 00:22:12.380
The first possibility
is that they cancel.

00:22:16.580 --> 00:22:18.590
Completely, they disappear.

00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:25.320
The second possibility is
that, OK, they pass each other.

00:22:31.330 --> 00:22:34.270
The third possibility
is that, OK,

00:22:34.270 --> 00:22:37.570
it depends on the
mood of the string.

00:22:37.570 --> 00:22:40.680
Maybe something
interesting is popping out.

00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:47.290
Maybe it decide to produce
two circular waves.

00:22:47.290 --> 00:22:48.690
Get creative, right?

00:22:48.690 --> 00:22:49.190
Creative.

00:22:54.370 --> 00:22:55.870
OK, everybody have to vote.

00:22:55.870 --> 00:22:57.100
OK?

00:22:57.100 --> 00:23:01.930
How many of you think that
you will cancel and disappear.

00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:06.760
Anybody?

00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:07.630
Nobody?

00:23:07.630 --> 00:23:08.130
Really?

00:23:11.060 --> 00:23:14.570
So you can see that
here, nothings there.

00:23:14.570 --> 00:23:16.250
Right?

00:23:16.250 --> 00:23:18.300
Why didn't you think
that will be canceled?

00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:20.620
OK, nobody think
that will cancel.

00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:22.190
Very good.

00:23:22.190 --> 00:23:23.552
Maybe we are all wrong, right?

00:23:23.552 --> 00:23:25.160
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:28.880
Second, they'll pass each other.

00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:30.300
How many of you think so?

00:23:44.750 --> 00:23:46.950
Very good.

00:23:46.950 --> 00:23:50.360
Finally, how many of
you think that will be,

00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:53.330
oh, no, it depends on
the mood of the string.

00:23:53.330 --> 00:23:55.010
Get creative.

00:23:55.010 --> 00:23:58.700
One, two, three-- thank
you for the support.

00:23:58.700 --> 00:24:00.050
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:00.050 --> 00:24:01.320
There are four people.

00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:01.820
OK.

00:24:05.150 --> 00:24:10.900
So let's discuss these
three situations carefully.

00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:15.470
So the first situation,
if they cancel exactly,

00:24:15.470 --> 00:24:21.290
which sounds logical because
if you look at this string

00:24:21.290 --> 00:24:25.965
how could this string
remember what happened before?

00:24:29.180 --> 00:24:32.150
How could it remember?

00:24:32.150 --> 00:24:40.450
Therefore, shouldn't answer
number one be a logical choice?

00:24:40.450 --> 00:24:45.760
The catch is, OK, if they cancel
then that means energy is not

00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:47.410
conserved.

00:24:47.410 --> 00:24:50.230
So somehow the energy I put in--

00:24:50.230 --> 00:24:55.750
I work really hard to shake
the string, use my energy.

00:24:55.750 --> 00:24:57.070
And it disappear.

00:24:57.070 --> 00:24:58.180
Oh my god, disappear.

00:24:58.180 --> 00:25:01.420
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:05.290
Then the energy is sad.

00:25:05.290 --> 00:25:12.860
The second one is, OK, I
believe in energy conservation.

00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:14.870
So they will pass each other.

00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:20.680
But that means the string
have memory because right

00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:22.880
now there's nothing there.

00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:25.630
What is going on?

00:25:25.630 --> 00:25:29.450
OK, since most of you think that
is actually what is happening,

00:25:29.450 --> 00:25:34.010
can some of you explain to
me how this string actually

00:25:34.010 --> 00:25:37.270
remember what happened before?

00:25:37.270 --> 00:25:40.965
Anybody can help me.

00:25:40.965 --> 00:25:42.462
AUDIENCE: Maybe
the two light forms

00:25:42.462 --> 00:25:44.957
reflect off of each other.

00:25:44.957 --> 00:25:46.672
Bounce off of each
other or something.

00:25:46.672 --> 00:25:48.380
PROFESSOR: Yeah, they
balance each other,

00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:57.720
but how is this different from
a stationary string at rest?

00:25:57.720 --> 00:26:00.420
Of course, I mean at some point
it looks identical, right?

00:26:00.420 --> 00:26:04.890
But there's something which
is different between this one

00:26:04.890 --> 00:26:07.420
and that one.

00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:09.308
AUDIENCE: There's
no [INAUDIBLE]..

00:26:09.308 --> 00:26:11.668
No [INAUDIBLE] in the string.

00:26:11.668 --> 00:26:13.100
[INAUDIBLE]

00:26:13.100 --> 00:26:14.900
PROFESSOR: Very good point.

00:26:14.900 --> 00:26:21.560
This one, which is actually
unperturbed, has zero velocity.

00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:24.050
And this one, no.

00:26:24.050 --> 00:26:26.600
It actually have a got velocity.

00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:30.500
Actually, this string is
already or starting to--

00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:34.100
it's already ready to move down.

00:26:34.100 --> 00:26:39.980
And this part of the string
is already ready to move up.

00:26:39.980 --> 00:26:43.700
So that is actually
how the string can

00:26:43.700 --> 00:26:45.940
remember what happened before.

00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:52.310
It remembered it
by the velocity.

00:26:52.310 --> 00:26:55.710
So what is actually not
plotted here is a trick.

00:26:55.710 --> 00:26:58.400
It's actually the velocity.

00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:04.530
The velocity is already nonzero
compared to this situation.

00:27:04.530 --> 00:27:08.340
And what is going to happen
is that afterward you

00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:14.480
will produce two corresponding
triangular pulse,

00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:18.300
continue and then
pass each other.

00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:21.980
Finally, the third
condition, creative.

00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:27.200
That may not happen because
all the memory is still there

00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:31.710
in the form of kinetic energy.

00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:41.820
So we can actually go ahead and
do a small demonstration here.

00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:46.290
So let's focus on the right-hand
side part of this setup.

00:27:46.290 --> 00:27:51.810
So this is actually the Bell
Lab machine we had before.

00:27:51.810 --> 00:27:53.790
So now, what I'm
going to do is now

00:27:53.790 --> 00:27:57.640
I'm going to create a square
pulse-- positive square

00:27:57.640 --> 00:27:59.350
pulse from the lab inside.

00:27:59.350 --> 00:28:04.200
And the negative pulse
in the right-hand side

00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:07.150
and see what is going to happen.

00:28:07.150 --> 00:28:08.981
No, not like this.

00:28:08.981 --> 00:28:09.480
Stop.

00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:10.050
Stop.

00:28:10.050 --> 00:28:11.130
OK.

00:28:11.130 --> 00:28:11.760
All right.

00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:14.160
Let's do it.

00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:15.140
You see?

00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:17.180
They pass each other.

00:28:17.180 --> 00:28:19.490
And the shape
actually continues.

00:28:19.490 --> 00:28:22.500
So let's do that again.

00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:26.700
They cancel at some point,
but they do pass each other

00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:27.370
and continue.

00:28:27.370 --> 00:28:29.430
And there are some
refractions, et cetera,

00:28:29.430 --> 00:28:31.770
which we are going
to discuss afterward.

00:28:31.770 --> 00:28:34.350
Let's do that again.

00:28:34.350 --> 00:28:35.140
You see?

00:28:35.140 --> 00:28:37.260
At some point, they cancel.

00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:40.410
But the positive pulse
continue traveling

00:28:40.410 --> 00:28:42.570
to your left-hand side.

00:28:42.570 --> 00:28:46.630
And then the negative pulse
travel to your right-hand side.

00:28:46.630 --> 00:28:47.567
Continue, please.

00:28:50.140 --> 00:28:55.420
So based on the experiment most
of you actually were correct.

00:28:55.420 --> 00:28:59.020
The answer is number two.

00:28:59.020 --> 00:29:03.150
And I would like to show
you a few more examples

00:29:03.150 --> 00:29:07.360
based on my little simulation.

00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:12.790
So first of all, I would like
to show you a triangular pulse.

00:29:12.790 --> 00:29:14.890
They pass each other.

00:29:14.890 --> 00:29:18.550
And you can see that
they pass each other,

00:29:18.550 --> 00:29:22.540
and the shape is actually
changing as a function of time.

00:29:22.540 --> 00:29:25.930
And actually, afterward,
they continue,

00:29:25.930 --> 00:29:29.140
and they keep the
same shape based

00:29:29.140 --> 00:29:33.250
on this computer simulation.

00:29:33.250 --> 00:29:35.070
Another interesting
thing to notice

00:29:35.070 --> 00:29:40.780
is that if you focus on
the point at x equal to 0,

00:29:40.780 --> 00:29:44.880
you will see that at this
point actually never change

00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:46.100
amplitude.

00:29:46.100 --> 00:29:49.890
Because those two pulse
are really symmetric.

00:29:49.890 --> 00:29:54.190
One is positive, the
other one is negative.

00:29:54.190 --> 00:29:57.470
As usual, we can actually
change the shape of the pulse.

00:29:57.470 --> 00:30:00.250
For example, I can changed
it to circular shape

00:30:00.250 --> 00:30:02.870
and see what will happen.

00:30:02.870 --> 00:30:03.600
Oh.

00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:05.940
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:05.940 --> 00:30:11.500
And again, the position at
x equal to 0 is unchanged.

00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:15.070
Let's take a look at that again.

00:30:15.070 --> 00:30:17.600
It really does
something really funny.

00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:18.541
It looks like, voom.

00:30:21.190 --> 00:30:22.890
And then you can see
that it is actually

00:30:22.890 --> 00:30:29.960
the velocity of the individual
component of the string.

00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:32.880
Which it remember though
in the original shape.

00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:37.260
So it can see the
velocity by eye looks

00:30:37.260 --> 00:30:41.650
different from what you see it
before in the first example.

00:30:41.650 --> 00:30:46.110
And finally, as usual,
we have the MIT waves.

00:30:46.110 --> 00:30:47.610
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:47.610 --> 00:30:51.330
And it does really,
really crazy things.

00:30:51.330 --> 00:30:54.990
And the amazing thing
is that the string

00:30:54.990 --> 00:30:58.160
have such a good memory.

00:30:58.160 --> 00:31:03.570
It really remember
what is going to happen

00:31:03.570 --> 00:31:05.490
before they touch each other.

00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:14.650
So what is going to happen
to these two MIT waves?

00:31:14.650 --> 00:31:17.820
They are going to be
propagating forever.

00:31:17.820 --> 00:31:21.240
Cannot stop until the
edge of the universe.

00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:25.090
Maybe they dig out of the
universe, but not my problem

00:31:25.090 --> 00:31:27.970
anymore.

00:31:27.970 --> 00:31:31.180
So we talk about
the energy stored

00:31:31.180 --> 00:31:34.060
in the string and et cetera.

00:31:34.060 --> 00:31:38.140
So how about we go ahead and
calculate the kinetic energy

00:31:38.140 --> 00:31:39.860
and the potential energy.

00:31:39.860 --> 00:31:42.570
So the first part is
the kinetic energy.

00:31:50.670 --> 00:31:55.350
Only one is actually
half mv square.

00:31:55.350 --> 00:32:02.740
So if I consider a small
segment on the string, which

00:32:02.740 --> 00:32:05.640
have a width of delta x.

00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:08.580
And I can now calculate delta m.

00:32:08.580 --> 00:32:13.720
If I assume this string have
a mass per unit length Rho

00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:17.100
L, and the string tension t.

00:32:17.100 --> 00:32:21.810
If that's actually given to you
when we set up the experiment,

00:32:21.810 --> 00:32:28.320
then we can actually calculate
the mass of this small portion

00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:29.430
of the string.

00:32:29.430 --> 00:32:35.160
Then delta m, the mass, will
be equal to Rho L times dx.

00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:40.050
Because Rho L is the
mass per unit length.

00:32:40.050 --> 00:32:42.930
Therefore, what is
actually the kinetic energy

00:32:42.930 --> 00:32:44.880
is becoming pretty
straight forward.

00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:49.350
It's the integration
over the whole string.

00:32:49.350 --> 00:32:53.280
Integration over the
whole string is 1/2--

00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:55.656
based on this equation--

00:32:55.656 --> 00:33:01.970
Rho L, dx, and times v.

00:33:01.970 --> 00:33:04.330
But what is actually v here?

00:33:04.330 --> 00:33:09.600
v is actually the velocity
of individual point-like mass

00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:10.320
on the string.

00:33:13.180 --> 00:33:16.110
And we actually already
talked about that.

00:33:16.110 --> 00:33:19.470
The velocity of individual
mass is actually only

00:33:19.470 --> 00:33:21.690
in the y direction.

00:33:21.690 --> 00:33:24.690
And the position
of individual mass

00:33:24.690 --> 00:33:30.930
is described by
the function Psi.

00:33:30.930 --> 00:33:33.030
Therefore, what is
actually velocity?

00:33:33.030 --> 00:33:38.820
Velocity is actually
partial Psi, partial t.

00:33:38.820 --> 00:33:44.010
So that is actually giving you
the velocity of individual mass

00:33:44.010 --> 00:33:45.240
on the string.

00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:48.900
And then if you square that,
that is actually giving you

00:33:48.900 --> 00:33:51.580
the total kinetic energy--

00:33:51.580 --> 00:33:53.216
is in this functional form.

00:33:57.020 --> 00:33:59.910
Let's also discuss what is
actually the potential energy.

00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:12.989
The potential energy as you
remember delta W, the work,

00:34:12.989 --> 00:34:18.460
is equal to F times delta
S, the displacement.

00:34:18.460 --> 00:34:23.730
F is the force, and the
delta S is the displacement.

00:34:23.730 --> 00:34:28.510
So originally,
before we actually

00:34:28.510 --> 00:34:31.800
perturb and make some
displacement with respect

00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:34.020
to equilibrium position--

00:34:34.020 --> 00:34:37.010
this string have
originally-- if I

00:34:37.010 --> 00:34:41.960
look at this small part of the
string I join in this region.

00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:43.940
This looks like this.

00:34:43.940 --> 00:34:50.750
This is delta x, and it has
a constant string tension t.

00:34:50.750 --> 00:34:57.710
Now, I can actually
introduce some displacement.

00:34:57.710 --> 00:35:00.010
And what is going
to happen is, look,

00:35:00.010 --> 00:35:02.390
it's going to look like this.

00:35:02.390 --> 00:35:08.030
This string is actually
a little bit stretched.

00:35:08.030 --> 00:35:13.430
And this is actually
the original delta x.

00:35:13.430 --> 00:35:16.880
The width of this
little segment.

00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:23.450
And this direction is
actually a small change

00:35:23.450 --> 00:35:33.210
in the y direction, which is
actually showing us delta Psi.

00:35:33.210 --> 00:35:36.060
And of course, we can
calculate the length.

00:35:36.060 --> 00:35:39.400
The length of this
string and that

00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:44.310
will give you square root of
delta x square plus delta Psi

00:35:44.310 --> 00:35:44.810
square.

00:35:49.980 --> 00:35:56.800
We can now go ahead and
calculate the delta W.

00:35:56.800 --> 00:36:03.160
So delta W will be equal to F,
which is the force, times delta

00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:08.680
S. We know in the force-- the
magnitude of the force is what?

00:36:08.680 --> 00:36:11.970
Is the string tension.

00:36:11.970 --> 00:36:14.690
So therefore, I put T here.

00:36:14.690 --> 00:36:17.320
And delta S, what is delta S?

00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:22.700
Is how much I
stretch this string.

00:36:22.700 --> 00:36:24.320
So this is actually
the difference

00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:32.120
between the resulting length and
the original length, delta x.

00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:38.540
So that is actually
giving you the delta S. So

00:36:38.540 --> 00:36:43.100
that means I can write it
in this functional form.

00:36:43.100 --> 00:36:48.640
dx square plus d
Psi square minus dx.

00:36:53.220 --> 00:37:01.080
I can of course take delta x
out of this square root thing,

00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:05.380
and basically I get
delta x, square root of 1

00:37:05.380 --> 00:37:11.600
plus d Psi dx square minus dx.

00:37:14.130 --> 00:37:20.280
Remember what we have
been discussing until now,

00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:24.510
we were always discussing
small amplitude--

00:37:24.510 --> 00:37:27.570
or small vibration.

00:37:27.570 --> 00:37:35.220
Therefore, that means I can use
a small angle approximation.

00:37:35.220 --> 00:37:38.670
That means delta Psi is
going to be very, very

00:37:38.670 --> 00:37:42.720
small with respect to delta x.

00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:54.490
So that means the first turn
will be roughly delta x 1

00:37:54.490 --> 00:38:03.220
plus d Psi dx squared
1/2 because you

00:38:03.220 --> 00:38:08.110
have a square root of that,
plus higher order turn.

00:38:15.970 --> 00:38:19.780
And of course we assume
that delta Psi is actually

00:38:19.780 --> 00:38:21.850
much smaller than delta x.

00:38:21.850 --> 00:38:27.580
Therefore, we ignore all
those higher order terms.

00:38:27.580 --> 00:38:30.810
So if we actually replace
this expression back

00:38:30.810 --> 00:38:33.220
into the original
equation, you will

00:38:33.220 --> 00:38:39.790
see that the first turn, 1
cancel with this minus dx turn.

00:38:39.790 --> 00:38:42.556
This actually cancel that.

00:38:42.556 --> 00:38:44.950
They actually cancel.

00:38:44.950 --> 00:38:53.020
Therefore, I can calculate dW
will be equal to T times delta

00:38:53.020 --> 00:39:01.690
x, times 1/2 d Psi dx square.

00:39:01.690 --> 00:39:05.630
Therefore, what will be
the total potential energy.

00:39:05.630 --> 00:39:08.470
The total potential
energy will be

00:39:08.470 --> 00:39:17.850
in the equation of the work
dW over the whole range from--

00:39:17.850 --> 00:39:20.140
of the system.

00:39:20.140 --> 00:39:29.010
And basically, you can actually
write it down as 1/2 T Psi.

00:39:33.260 --> 00:39:37.610
Partial Psi,
partial x square dx.

00:39:40.890 --> 00:39:45.810
All right, so we can actually
understand and calculate

00:39:45.810 --> 00:39:49.600
the kinetic energy and
the potential energy.

00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:55.170
So before we take a break,
let's take a short example

00:39:55.170 --> 00:39:59.640
to check if we understand
what we have learned so far.

00:39:59.640 --> 00:40:03.180
So for example, if
I have a function

00:40:03.180 --> 00:40:11.070
Psi xt, and that is
actually equal to 1 over 1

00:40:11.070 --> 00:40:15.820
plus x minus 3t to the fourth.

00:40:15.820 --> 00:40:17.430
It's a crazy function.

00:40:17.430 --> 00:40:22.460
If I assume that I can
do a very precise thing,

00:40:22.460 --> 00:40:26.670
manipulate this string so
that I produce a wave function

00:40:26.670 --> 00:40:28.080
of this functional form.

00:40:28.080 --> 00:40:32.580
1 over 1 plus x minus
3t to the fourth.

00:40:32.580 --> 00:40:35.100
Can somebody tell me
what is actually going

00:40:35.100 --> 00:40:40.270
to be the velocity of the wave?

00:40:40.270 --> 00:40:41.520
Can anybody tell me?

00:40:45.882 --> 00:40:47.340
The first thing
which you can do is

00:40:47.340 --> 00:40:50.610
to express this crazy
function in a functional

00:40:50.610 --> 00:40:54.480
form of fx minus Vpt, right?

00:40:54.480 --> 00:40:59.220
And the Vp is actually the
speed of the wave, right?

00:40:59.220 --> 00:41:01.590
So anybody know what
is actually-- yes?

00:41:01.590 --> 00:41:02.550
AUDIENCE: Three.

00:41:02.550 --> 00:41:05.340
PROFESSOR: Yeah, the three
because the whole function

00:41:05.340 --> 00:41:08.060
can be written as f x minus 3t.

00:41:10.830 --> 00:41:16.140
Therefore, the
velocity Vp will be 3.

00:41:16.140 --> 00:41:18.720
Of course if you
are not sure, you

00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:22.820
can actually calculate
Vp square by the ratio

00:41:22.820 --> 00:41:30.190
of partial square Psi, partial t
square, and partial square Psi,

00:41:30.190 --> 00:41:31.830
partial x square.

00:41:31.830 --> 00:41:34.800
And that will give you
of course the Vp square,

00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:38.640
according to that wave equation.

00:41:38.640 --> 00:41:42.600
All right, so we will take a
five minute break from now.

00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:49.080
And during the break I will
try to return the exam to you.

00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:53.130
So we will come back at 24--

00:41:53.130 --> 00:41:53.940
12:24.

00:42:03.880 --> 00:42:06.050
So welcome back, everybody.

00:42:06.050 --> 00:42:09.790
So we will continue the
discussion of traveling wave.

00:42:12.680 --> 00:42:14.710
So we have the very
interesting discussion

00:42:14.710 --> 00:42:17.750
of two waves that are
canceling each other.

00:42:17.750 --> 00:42:20.950
And somehow the
string have a way

00:42:20.950 --> 00:42:23.890
to remember what happened
before, which is actually

00:42:23.890 --> 00:42:27.850
the velocity of each
individual point on the string

00:42:27.850 --> 00:42:31.340
as a function of x--

00:42:31.340 --> 00:42:33.190
that instance of time.

00:42:33.190 --> 00:42:36.620
So let's actually take
a look at this example.

00:42:36.620 --> 00:42:41.640
So make use of what we
have learned so far.

00:42:41.640 --> 00:42:46.410
As we see here there
is a triangular shape,

00:42:46.410 --> 00:42:49.990
which I create in the lab.

00:42:49.990 --> 00:42:55.420
And this triangular
shape is actually there

00:42:55.420 --> 00:42:57.350
and it's stationary.

00:42:57.350 --> 00:42:59.110
It's not moving.

00:42:59.110 --> 00:43:04.870
The strings are at rest,
but have a triangular shape,

00:43:04.870 --> 00:43:07.180
which I setup there.

00:43:07.180 --> 00:43:10.190
So based on what we
have learned so far--

00:43:10.190 --> 00:43:13.110
we have learned
normal modes, we have

00:43:13.110 --> 00:43:17.290
learned about traveling wave.

00:43:17.290 --> 00:43:21.670
I believe before we learned
this class, the first reaction

00:43:21.670 --> 00:43:25.020
to you is to do what?

00:43:25.020 --> 00:43:26.784
What kind of decomposition.

00:43:26.784 --> 00:43:27.700
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:27.700 --> 00:43:30.706
PROFESSOR: Fourier
decomposition.

00:43:30.706 --> 00:43:34.210
So what you are going
to do is, OK, very good.

00:43:34.210 --> 00:43:34.990
I have this shape.

00:43:34.990 --> 00:43:37.420
So I do a Fourier
decomposition and I

00:43:37.420 --> 00:43:39.310
have infinite number of terms.

00:43:39.310 --> 00:43:43.120
And I am going to evolve
infinite number of term

00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:47.930
as a function of time and see
what will happen to the system.

00:43:47.930 --> 00:43:51.590
So that's actually what
you would do before we

00:43:51.590 --> 00:43:52.750
learned traveling wave.

00:43:55.300 --> 00:43:58.900
What I would like to say
today is that if I really

00:43:58.900 --> 00:44:06.185
prepare this string at rest,
stationary, at t equal to 0--

00:44:09.070 --> 00:44:13.260
in contrast to what
I just said before,

00:44:13.260 --> 00:44:16.140
brute force measure,
which I used computer

00:44:16.140 --> 00:44:20.280
to decompose it and evolve all
the infinite number of terms.

00:44:20.280 --> 00:44:25.800
What we could do is
that I can show you

00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:30.950
that this situation is a
superposition of two traveling

00:44:30.950 --> 00:44:31.450
waves.

00:44:34.410 --> 00:44:36.450
Then the question
becomes super simple.

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:45.420
So instead of doing a
brute force calculation

00:44:45.420 --> 00:44:46.810
using computer--

00:44:46.810 --> 00:44:50.430
decompose it to infinite
number of normal modes--

00:44:50.430 --> 00:44:52.860
what I can actually
show you is that, OK,

00:44:52.860 --> 00:45:08.340
if I have a g function, which is
equal to f x plus Vpt plus f x

00:45:08.340 --> 00:45:11.190
minus Vpt.

00:45:11.190 --> 00:45:16.110
So these three function
is superposition of two

00:45:16.110 --> 00:45:19.050
traveling waves.

00:45:19.050 --> 00:45:22.920
The shape is described
by f function.

00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:26.910
And one of them is traveling
to the right-hand side.

00:45:26.910 --> 00:45:30.360
The other one is actually
traveling to a left-hand side.

00:45:30.360 --> 00:45:34.020
If I assume that the
superposition of these two

00:45:34.020 --> 00:45:40.990
traveling wave is g then I can
now calculate the velocity,

00:45:40.990 --> 00:45:43.590
partial g, partial t.

00:45:43.590 --> 00:45:50.190
And that will give
you Vp f prime minus--

00:45:50.190 --> 00:45:52.950
right, because here it's
actually x minus Vp--

00:45:52.950 --> 00:45:57.760
so I got minus Vp
out of it, f prime.

00:45:57.760 --> 00:46:01.230
The first term, if I do this
partial differentiation,

00:46:01.230 --> 00:46:04.755
then basically I get the
positive Vp out of it.

00:46:04.755 --> 00:46:09.540
And then the second term
I get minus Vp out of it.

00:46:09.540 --> 00:46:14.950
And these two terms
cancel exactly.

00:46:14.950 --> 00:46:16.660
What does that mean?

00:46:16.660 --> 00:46:21.100
That means all the points--

00:46:21.100 --> 00:46:24.730
this g is actually a
function of x and t--

00:46:24.730 --> 00:46:32.320
on the point at t equal
to 0 have initial d

00:46:32.320 --> 00:46:34.752
velocity equal to 0.

00:46:37.760 --> 00:46:43.970
So in other word, if I have
any random kind of shape--

00:46:43.970 --> 00:46:48.260
in this case is a
triangular shape--

00:46:48.260 --> 00:46:53.890
I can always decompose
this stationary shape

00:46:53.890 --> 00:46:58.190
into two traveling wave.

00:46:58.190 --> 00:47:02.310
One is actually traveling
in the positive direction.

00:47:02.310 --> 00:47:06.110
The other one is traveling
in the negative direction.

00:47:06.110 --> 00:47:08.720
So that means what is happening?

00:47:08.720 --> 00:47:17.690
This is equal to a superposition
of two traveling waves.

00:47:17.690 --> 00:47:24.800
If I assume the height of
this mountain to be h then

00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:30.230
I need to have h
over 2 as the height

00:47:30.230 --> 00:47:33.020
for the individual
traveling waves.

00:47:33.020 --> 00:47:37.430
One is actually traveling
to the right-hand side.

00:47:37.430 --> 00:47:39.470
The other one is
actually traveling to he

00:47:39.470 --> 00:47:42.140
left-hand side of the board.

00:47:42.140 --> 00:47:46.640
So based on this
trick, actually we

00:47:46.640 --> 00:47:51.750
can see that I don't need to
do infinite number of terms

00:47:51.750 --> 00:47:53.120
anymore.

00:47:53.120 --> 00:47:55.520
I don't need to do a
Fourier decomposition

00:47:55.520 --> 00:47:59.980
and get really crazy
and take forever

00:47:59.980 --> 00:48:03.410
to write the code
on your computer.

00:48:03.410 --> 00:48:06.830
And maybe there are
some bug in your code,

00:48:06.830 --> 00:48:09.360
which is frustrating.

00:48:09.360 --> 00:48:14.390
And what we could do is
to simply decompose it

00:48:14.390 --> 00:48:16.310
into two traveling wave.

00:48:16.310 --> 00:48:19.180
And I can now predict
what will happened

00:48:19.180 --> 00:48:24.080
at time equal to, for example,
5 what is going to happen.

00:48:24.080 --> 00:48:28.670
So what is going to happen is
that you have two triangular

00:48:28.670 --> 00:48:31.870
shape waves.

00:48:31.870 --> 00:48:38.090
Each of them actually traveled
a distance of 5 times Vp.

00:48:45.030 --> 00:48:50.190
So that is actually a
very interesting fact.

00:48:50.190 --> 00:48:52.560
And of course we
can see from here

00:48:52.560 --> 00:48:56.430
if I quickly create
a triangular shape,

00:48:56.430 --> 00:49:00.610
and you will see that it really
did become two triangular shape

00:49:00.610 --> 00:49:01.440
wave.

00:49:01.440 --> 00:49:02.400
So I can do this.

00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:08.240
I can do this.

00:49:08.240 --> 00:49:08.910
You see?

00:49:08.910 --> 00:49:15.840
So originally, I'm creating
some stationary shape.

00:49:15.840 --> 00:49:17.670
And I release that.

00:49:17.670 --> 00:49:22.020
It does become two
traveling waves

00:49:22.020 --> 00:49:24.810
with amplitude half of
the original height--

00:49:24.810 --> 00:49:26.330
original displacement.

00:49:26.330 --> 00:49:32.140
I can also do it in the opposite
direction, a positive wave.

00:49:32.140 --> 00:49:34.100
You see?

00:49:34.100 --> 00:49:35.040
It does work.

00:49:35.040 --> 00:49:37.050
And of course,
after the class you

00:49:37.050 --> 00:49:40.690
can make even more
complicated shape

00:49:40.690 --> 00:49:43.630
if I have many more
than two hands.

00:49:43.630 --> 00:49:46.215
Maybe I can do that, but
unfortunately I'm human.

00:49:49.670 --> 00:49:53.900
You can see that I can
create different slope

00:49:53.900 --> 00:49:55.970
in the positive and negative h.

00:49:55.970 --> 00:50:00.110
And it does create
two traveling wave.

00:50:00.110 --> 00:50:03.860
And that's amazing
because this is actually

00:50:03.860 --> 00:50:07.400
looks like just some kind
of mathematical trick.

00:50:07.400 --> 00:50:13.250
And it really match with what
we can do experimentally.

00:50:13.250 --> 00:50:19.620
So finally, I would like to
talk about the last topic

00:50:19.620 --> 00:50:29.370
of the lecture today,
which is to connect

00:50:29.370 --> 00:50:32.790
two strings together.

00:50:32.790 --> 00:50:35.720
So suppose I have two strings--

00:50:35.720 --> 00:50:39.470
the left-hand side string
is actually thinner.

00:50:39.470 --> 00:50:47.130
It has mass per unit length
Rho L, and string tension t.

00:50:47.130 --> 00:50:56.060
In the right-hand side you can
have a thicker string with mass

00:50:56.060 --> 00:51:00.980
per unit length 4 times Rho
L, and the string tension

00:51:00.980 --> 00:51:02.190
is as you keep constant t.

00:51:05.250 --> 00:51:08.310
Based on what we
have learned before,

00:51:08.310 --> 00:51:17.400
the velocity Vp, is equal to
square root of t over Rho L.

00:51:17.400 --> 00:51:21.100
So that's actually from
the last few lectures.

00:51:21.100 --> 00:51:24.600
So left-hand side
you will have V1,

00:51:24.600 --> 00:51:28.780
which is the velocity of the
traveling wave, equal to square

00:51:28.780 --> 00:51:31.410
root of t over Rho L.

00:51:31.410 --> 00:51:35.450
And the right-hand side you
will have square root of t

00:51:35.450 --> 00:51:44.160
over 4 Rho L. And that will
give you one half of V1.

00:51:44.160 --> 00:51:45.580
So what does that mean?

00:51:45.580 --> 00:51:47.500
This means that if
I have a traveling

00:51:47.500 --> 00:51:52.370
wave in the left-hand side,
the speed of the traveling wave

00:51:52.370 --> 00:51:56.935
will be 2 times the
speed of the traveling

00:51:56.935 --> 00:52:02.640
wave in the right-hand side
based on this calculation.

00:52:02.640 --> 00:52:07.110
So what I would like to
do is the following--

00:52:07.110 --> 00:52:11.880
so I would like to ask a
question about this system.

00:52:11.880 --> 00:52:18.950
What will happen if I introduce
a displacement and a traveling

00:52:18.950 --> 00:52:22.340
wave from the left-hand side.

00:52:22.340 --> 00:52:24.770
And the question
is, what is going

00:52:24.770 --> 00:52:27.780
to happen to this system
as a function of time

00:52:27.780 --> 00:52:31.530
once I actually give this
input traveling wave.

00:52:31.530 --> 00:52:35.200
And the answer is that
this traveling wave

00:52:35.200 --> 00:52:39.410
is going to pass through
the boundary of two systems.

00:52:39.410 --> 00:52:41.630
And there may be refraction.

00:52:41.630 --> 00:52:44.400
There may be
transmission, et cetera.

00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:47.130
And that we are actually
in the good position

00:52:47.130 --> 00:52:50.510
to understand this phenomena.

00:52:50.510 --> 00:52:54.300
So let's take a look at
this situation carefully.

00:52:54.300 --> 00:53:01.070
So now I define here the
position of the boundary

00:53:01.070 --> 00:53:05.330
is at x equal to 0.

00:53:05.330 --> 00:53:12.200
And I can now go ahead and write
down the conditions, which is--

00:53:12.200 --> 00:53:14.930
need to be satisfied in
order to connect these two

00:53:14.930 --> 00:53:17.030
systems properly.

00:53:17.030 --> 00:53:21.620
Which you actually already
see this several times,

00:53:21.620 --> 00:53:24.700
the boundary condition.

00:53:28.230 --> 00:53:30.720
So what are the
boundary conditions

00:53:30.720 --> 00:53:34.660
which I need in order to
connect the left-hand side

00:53:34.660 --> 00:53:37.920
and the right-hand side systems?

00:53:37.920 --> 00:53:40.320
So the first
boundary condition is

00:53:40.320 --> 00:53:43.950
that the string is continuous.

00:53:43.950 --> 00:53:47.835
Therefore, if I
have some kind of y

00:53:47.835 --> 00:53:51.540
is actually-- y of
x t is describing

00:53:51.540 --> 00:53:56.150
the displacement of all
the time mass on the string

00:53:56.150 --> 00:53:58.560
in a horizontal direction.

00:53:58.560 --> 00:54:03.010
Then that means y the
left-hand side evaluated

00:54:03.010 --> 00:54:10.290
at 0 minus in the slightly
left-hand side of the boundary

00:54:10.290 --> 00:54:17.700
will be equal to YR, which
is actually evaluated

00:54:17.700 --> 00:54:21.260
at the slightly right-hand
side of the boundary

00:54:21.260 --> 00:54:23.700
at x equal to 0.

00:54:23.700 --> 00:54:29.700
And the YL is actually the wave
function for the left-hand side

00:54:29.700 --> 00:54:31.590
thinner string.

00:54:31.590 --> 00:54:37.630
And the YR is actually
the wave function,

00:54:37.630 --> 00:54:41.940
which describe the right-hand
side of the string.

00:54:41.940 --> 00:54:46.740
So this means that the boundary
condition tells us that

00:54:46.740 --> 00:54:53.970
the string cannot break.

00:54:53.970 --> 00:54:57.120
It should match carefully
so that these two

00:54:57.120 --> 00:55:00.730
systems are connected
to each other properly.

00:55:00.730 --> 00:55:04.370
The second condition
is that, OK,

00:55:04.370 --> 00:55:13.130
since this boundary actually
have no massive particles left,

00:55:13.130 --> 00:55:17.520
I can't actually assume that
this is massless ring there.

00:55:17.520 --> 00:55:22.450
Therefore, the slope
of the left-hand side,

00:55:22.450 --> 00:55:28.350
partial YL, partial
x, s equal to 0,

00:55:28.350 --> 00:55:32.670
will have to be equal to the
slope at the right-hand side.

00:55:38.030 --> 00:55:41.080
If the slope doesn't match
between the left-hand side

00:55:41.080 --> 00:55:44.900
and right-hand side, that
means since they have constant

00:55:44.900 --> 00:55:49.040
tension that means the tension--
the string tension cannot

00:55:49.040 --> 00:55:50.510
cancel each other.

00:55:50.510 --> 00:55:54.080
Then the massless ring
will be transferred to,

00:55:54.080 --> 00:55:56.510
for example Mars, in a second.

00:55:56.510 --> 00:55:59.840
Because it has few infinite
amount of acceleration.

00:55:59.840 --> 00:56:01.130
And that didn't happen.

00:56:01.130 --> 00:56:07.340
When I actually tried
to actually displace

00:56:07.340 --> 00:56:12.410
the string or the
Bell Labs system,

00:56:12.410 --> 00:56:14.730
I didn't see crazy
things happen.

00:56:14.730 --> 00:56:18.950
Therefore, the
tension at this, which

00:56:18.950 --> 00:56:22.110
acting on this massless
ring must cancel each other.

00:56:22.110 --> 00:56:25.676
So that's the second
boundary condition we have.

00:56:28.760 --> 00:56:33.410
So now, I would like to
make some assumption.

00:56:33.410 --> 00:56:39.350
So first of all I have an
input pulse, which is actually

00:56:39.350 --> 00:56:43.310
coming into this system.

00:56:43.310 --> 00:56:44.180
Looks like this.

00:56:44.180 --> 00:56:48.980
And I call it fi,
is traveling toward

00:56:48.980 --> 00:56:53.150
the positive x direction.

00:56:53.150 --> 00:56:56.526
So therefore, I can of
course write it down

00:56:56.526 --> 00:57:00.670
as minus k1x plus omega t.

00:57:05.850 --> 00:57:12.030
So this is actually the
incident pulse, I call it fi.

00:57:12.030 --> 00:57:15.600
And after it pass the boundary--

00:57:15.600 --> 00:57:18.870
so I can actually
expect that there

00:57:18.870 --> 00:57:24.185
may be some kind of refraction,
which happened at the boundary,

00:57:24.185 --> 00:57:26.610
fr, I call it fr.

00:57:26.610 --> 00:57:31.250
And this time this fr
is going to be traveling

00:57:31.250 --> 00:57:33.870
to the negative x direction.

00:57:33.870 --> 00:57:37.260
Therefore, I can
express this function

00:57:37.260 --> 00:57:43.560
as fr is a function of
plus k1x plus omega t.

00:57:47.440 --> 00:57:52.730
Finally, there can be
also transmission wave.

00:57:52.730 --> 00:57:54.740
So you get the
refraction and there

00:57:54.740 --> 00:57:57.080
can be some energy,
which somehow

00:57:57.080 --> 00:57:58.970
pass through the boundary.

00:57:58.970 --> 00:58:03.080
And I call this
transmission wave ft,

00:58:03.080 --> 00:58:08.990
which is actually in a form
of minus k2x plus omega t.

00:58:12.310 --> 00:58:19.920
And in this case, I assume
that the system is actually

00:58:19.920 --> 00:58:22.860
having a k1 in the
left-hand side,

00:58:22.860 --> 00:58:24.930
and k2 in right-hand side.

00:58:24.930 --> 00:58:26.690
Which is actually
the wave number

00:58:26.690 --> 00:58:31.940
and the k1 is actually
equal to omega over V1.

00:58:31.940 --> 00:58:35.420
And the k2 is actually
equal to omega over V2.

00:58:38.810 --> 00:58:40.370
So that is actually the set up.

00:58:40.370 --> 00:58:43.330
And then also the
three traveling

00:58:43.330 --> 00:58:48.030
waves, which we actually
demonstrate the situation.

00:58:48.030 --> 00:58:52.910
So we can now go ahead and
plug those three traveling

00:58:52.910 --> 00:58:56.870
wave solution into the
boundary conditions.

00:58:56.870 --> 00:58:58.790
And then we will
be able to solve

00:58:58.790 --> 00:59:00.870
their relative amplitudes.

00:59:04.600 --> 00:59:07.926
So let's make use of the
first boundary condition.

00:59:12.980 --> 00:59:21.390
So YL is now a
superposition of fi and fr.

00:59:21.390 --> 00:59:28.260
YR will be just the
transmission wave, ft.

00:59:28.260 --> 00:59:31.860
So now, I can plug
this expression back

00:59:31.860 --> 00:59:34.390
into the equation number one.

00:59:34.390 --> 00:59:41.880
Then basically, what
I get is fi omega t.

00:59:41.880 --> 00:59:45.390
Originally, it's actually
minus k1x plus omega t,

00:59:45.390 --> 00:59:50.690
but this thing is actually
evaluated at x equal to 0.

00:59:50.690 --> 00:59:53.610
The wave function
has to be continuous

00:59:53.610 --> 00:59:57.780
between the negative side of
0 and the positive side of 0.

00:59:57.780 --> 01:00:03.600
Therefore, if I plug in x equal
to 0, minus k1 turn disappear.

01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:07.020
And what is left
over is omega t.

01:00:07.020 --> 01:00:12.250
And this is the second turn fr,
I can write down expressively.

01:00:12.250 --> 01:00:16.150
You get fr omega t.

01:00:16.150 --> 01:00:20.050
And then right-hand side
of the expression is YR,

01:00:20.050 --> 01:00:25.263
only have 1 turn, ft And now
you are going to get ft omega t.

01:00:29.070 --> 01:00:34.700
So now we can also go ahead
and plug in this equation

01:00:34.700 --> 01:00:36.480
to equation number two.

01:00:39.810 --> 01:00:44.940
What is going to happen is that
I do a partial differentiation

01:00:44.940 --> 01:00:45.960
with respect to x.

01:00:45.960 --> 01:00:50.530
And the plug in x equal
to 0 to the expression.

01:00:50.530 --> 01:00:54.900
And what I'm going
to get is minus k1

01:00:54.900 --> 01:01:00.200
f prime i, as a
function of omega t,

01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:07.250
plus k1 fr prime omega t.

01:01:07.250 --> 01:01:10.930
And this will be
equal to minus k2.

01:01:10.930 --> 01:01:15.030
In the right-hand side you only
have one turn, which is ft.

01:01:15.030 --> 01:01:21.894
So you are going to have minus
k2 ft, the function of omega t.

01:01:24.540 --> 01:01:28.030
Any questions so far?

01:01:28.030 --> 01:01:31.530
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:01:31.530 --> 01:01:34.200
PROFESSOR: Yes,
thank you very much.

01:01:34.200 --> 01:01:35.490
OK, very good.

01:01:35.490 --> 01:01:37.450
So we are making progress here.

01:01:37.450 --> 01:01:42.840
And what I can do now is
to do a integration over t

01:01:42.840 --> 01:01:45.450
for the equation number two.

01:01:45.450 --> 01:01:48.270
So if I do a
integration basically,

01:01:48.270 --> 01:01:55.120
what I'm going to get is
minus k1 over 2 fi omega t.

01:01:55.120 --> 01:02:00.020
I do a integration
over t, plus--

01:02:00.020 --> 01:02:11.060
over omega, sorry-- and the
plus K1 over omega fr omega t.

01:02:11.060 --> 01:02:18.887
And this is actually equal to
minus K2 over omega ft omega t.

01:02:21.560 --> 01:02:25.150
Based on the equation,
which we have before--

01:02:25.150 --> 01:02:30.300
K1 over omega is
actually 1 over V1.

01:02:30.300 --> 01:02:33.600
So basically, what
we have is actually--

01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:37.600
this is actually 1 over V1.

01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:40.500
This is actually 1 over V1.

01:02:40.500 --> 01:02:45.630
And this is actually 1 over V2.

01:02:45.630 --> 01:02:48.810
So in short while
we are going to get

01:02:48.810 --> 01:03:00.600
in the second equation will
become minus V2 fi omega t

01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:07.600
plus fr omega t.

01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:12.440
If I multiply both sides by V1
and V2 then I get the minus V2

01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:13.460
here.

01:03:13.460 --> 01:03:15.410
And this will be equal to--

01:03:19.170 --> 01:03:21.905
there should be a
minus here because I

01:03:21.905 --> 01:03:26.810
am taking out minus V2 there.

01:03:26.810 --> 01:03:30.680
And this will be equal
to the right-hand side

01:03:30.680 --> 01:03:33.505
because I multiply
both side by V1 and V2.

01:03:33.505 --> 01:03:39.944
Actually, I get
minus V1 ft omega t.

01:03:43.680 --> 01:03:46.060
So what is actually
left over is that now I

01:03:46.060 --> 01:03:51.280
have equation number one, and
I have equation number two.

01:03:51.280 --> 01:03:58.080
Those are just functions
of fi, fr, and ft. So

01:03:58.080 --> 01:04:03.070
that means we can actually
easily solve the equation

01:04:03.070 --> 01:04:06.530
and write everything
in terms of fi.

01:04:06.530 --> 01:04:13.450
So we can now solve
one and two and write

01:04:13.450 --> 01:04:23.400
in terms of fi, which is
actually the incident wave.

01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:25.110
That's actually
what we could do.

01:04:25.110 --> 01:04:26.250
So if I do that--

01:04:26.250 --> 01:04:28.980
if I solved the
equation one and two,

01:04:28.980 --> 01:04:33.060
basically I get fr
omega t, will be

01:04:33.060 --> 01:04:46.360
equal to V2 minus V1 divided
by V2 plus V1 times fi omega t.

01:04:46.360 --> 01:04:50.770
If you trust me, if I
try to solve one and two,

01:04:50.770 --> 01:04:56.950
and express fr, and
ft in terms of fi--

01:04:56.950 --> 01:05:01.180
then basically the second thing
which I get from this solution

01:05:01.180 --> 01:05:13.610
is that ft will be equal to 2V2
divided by V1 plus V2, fi omega

01:05:13.610 --> 01:05:16.150
t.

01:05:16.150 --> 01:05:19.580
So look at what we have done.

01:05:19.580 --> 01:05:21.670
Basically, the first
thing which we did

01:05:21.670 --> 01:05:25.650
is to identify what are
the boundary conditions.

01:05:25.650 --> 01:05:27.890
Under the condition
one is the string

01:05:27.890 --> 01:05:30.900
doesn't break at the boundary.

01:05:30.900 --> 01:05:33.670
The slope match between
the two boundary

01:05:33.670 --> 01:05:37.200
because you have
constant tension.

01:05:37.200 --> 01:05:41.750
Then I assume the solution have
the functional form of three

01:05:41.750 --> 01:05:42.800
traveling wave.

01:05:42.800 --> 01:05:46.040
The incident traveling
wave, fi, traveling

01:05:46.040 --> 01:05:47.855
to the positive direction.

01:05:47.855 --> 01:05:52.690
The refraction is
expressed as fr going

01:05:52.690 --> 01:05:54.470
to the negative direction.

01:05:54.470 --> 01:05:58.440
And finally, ft is going to--
is the transmission wave going

01:05:58.440 --> 01:06:00.870
to the positive direction.

01:06:00.870 --> 01:06:06.400
Then I plug those equation
in to the boundary condition.

01:06:06.400 --> 01:06:12.700
And I solve everything,
fr and ft, in terms of fi

01:06:12.700 --> 01:06:14.880
and this is actually what I get.

01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:18.850
So that's actually in short
what I have been doing.

01:06:18.850 --> 01:06:21.610
So basically, this
expression is actually

01:06:21.610 --> 01:06:31.040
equal to R time fi, where R is
actually V2 minus V1, divided

01:06:31.040 --> 01:06:34.480
by V1 plus V2.

01:06:34.480 --> 01:06:40.570
And in this case this is
equal to transmission,

01:06:40.570 --> 01:06:52.510
which I am writing as Tau, times
fi, the initial incident wave.

01:06:52.510 --> 01:07:00.070
And this Tau is equal to 2
times V2 divided by V1 plus V2.

01:07:00.070 --> 01:07:07.090
So in this example, V2
is equal to 1 over 2 V1.

01:07:07.090 --> 01:07:10.455
So I can now plug it
in and see what I get.

01:07:10.455 --> 01:07:15.550
Basically, V2 will be
equal to V1 over 2.

01:07:15.550 --> 01:07:21.160
Then I can evaluate,
will be the R and Tau.

01:07:21.160 --> 01:07:26.140
So the R will be minus 1/3.

01:07:26.140 --> 01:07:28.870
It's a negative value.

01:07:28.870 --> 01:07:32.080
And the Tau will be
equal to 2 over 3.

01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:39.250
So what have we
learned from here?

01:07:39.250 --> 01:07:46.840
So if I create a pulse starting
from the one which is actually

01:07:46.840 --> 01:07:47.680
have--

01:07:47.680 --> 01:07:52.060
which is lighter or
have smaller Rho L--

01:07:52.060 --> 01:07:54.490
smaller mass per unit length--

01:07:54.490 --> 01:07:57.630
when it passed
through the boundary

01:07:57.630 --> 01:08:03.010
there will be a refracted
wave, which the amplitude will

01:08:03.010 --> 01:08:06.417
change it's sign.

01:08:06.417 --> 01:08:08.000
So what is going to
happen is that you

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:13.060
will get a reflective wave and
the amplitude changes sign.

01:08:13.060 --> 01:08:16.130
And then there will
be a transmitted wave,

01:08:16.130 --> 01:08:19.939
which is actually going
to the positive direction.

01:08:19.939 --> 01:08:23.899
So this is actually a
demonstration we have here.

01:08:23.899 --> 01:08:28.260
So left-hand side is the system,
which I was talking about--

01:08:28.260 --> 01:08:31.160
the smaller Rho L system.

01:08:31.160 --> 01:08:36.109
And right-hand side is
the larger Rho L system.

01:08:36.109 --> 01:08:39.090
And now I can do the
experiment and see what happen.

01:08:39.090 --> 01:08:51.100
And I connect the two
system with this ring,

01:08:51.100 --> 01:08:52.880
so that they are
coupled to each other.

01:08:59.720 --> 01:09:00.801
I hope you will work.

01:09:07.870 --> 01:09:11.560
All right, so now I can create--

01:09:11.560 --> 01:09:15.460
oh, I'm in trouble now.

01:09:15.460 --> 01:09:15.960
One second.

01:09:18.779 --> 01:09:32.710
Hopefully will--
this is not easy.

01:09:32.710 --> 01:09:38.144
OK, now I can create a pulse
from the left-hand side.

01:09:38.144 --> 01:09:39.142
Oh, no.

01:09:47.140 --> 01:09:48.859
That is the pressure.

01:09:48.859 --> 01:09:51.410
So now I can create a pulse
from the left-hand side.

01:09:51.410 --> 01:09:53.870
And you can see that there
is a small pulse actually

01:09:53.870 --> 01:09:57.120
that pass through the median--

01:09:57.120 --> 01:10:01.980
pass through the boundary,
but unfortunately this demo

01:10:01.980 --> 01:10:04.156
is not setup already.

01:10:11.551 --> 01:10:13.040
Ah, gosh.

01:10:13.040 --> 01:10:16.300
OK, so we will see what
we can get from here.

01:10:16.300 --> 01:10:17.440
Now, it works.

01:10:17.440 --> 01:10:18.850
Very good.

01:10:18.850 --> 01:10:25.180
So now I can actually create a
pulse from the left-hand side,

01:10:25.180 --> 01:10:28.930
and you can see that it does
pass through this boundary

01:10:28.930 --> 01:10:29.980
if I setup the ring.

01:10:29.980 --> 01:10:34.390
The ring was falling down
somehow during the lecture.

01:10:34.390 --> 01:10:37.930
And this ring is actually
presenting the boundary

01:10:37.930 --> 01:10:41.680
and connect these two system.

01:10:41.680 --> 01:10:44.920
Based on what we predict
from the equation--

01:10:44.920 --> 01:10:49.450
basically you will see that
if I have a positive amplitude

01:10:49.450 --> 01:10:52.270
passing through
the boundary there

01:10:52.270 --> 01:10:56.740
will be a negative
pulse going backward

01:10:56.740 --> 01:11:02.890
and a positive pulse going
through the boundary, which

01:11:02.890 --> 01:11:04.330
is the transmission wave.

01:11:04.330 --> 01:11:06.910
And let's see what
is going to happen.

01:11:06.910 --> 01:11:07.750
You see?

01:11:07.750 --> 01:11:11.790
It does have a negative
pulse going backward.

01:11:11.790 --> 01:11:15.430
And you do see that there is
a pulse, which is actually

01:11:15.430 --> 01:11:17.280
going through this system.

01:11:17.280 --> 01:11:19.480
Let's see this again.

01:11:19.480 --> 01:11:23.080
You see that there's a
positive amplitude pulse going

01:11:23.080 --> 01:11:24.815
through the boundary
and that there's

01:11:24.815 --> 01:11:28.020
a refraction through this--

01:11:28.020 --> 01:11:32.530
which is actually going backward
in the left-hand side system.

01:11:32.530 --> 01:11:37.850
So on the other hand, if
I start a traveling wave

01:11:37.850 --> 01:11:44.750
from your left-hand
side, that means

01:11:44.750 --> 01:11:50.290
V2 is going to be
larger than V1.

01:11:50.290 --> 01:11:54.820
V2 is actually going to
be larger than the V1.

01:11:54.820 --> 01:12:00.340
So what are we going to
get is a positive amplitude

01:12:00.340 --> 01:12:06.730
refraction and also a positive
value transmission wave.

01:12:06.730 --> 01:12:10.510
And let's see what
is going to happen.

01:12:10.510 --> 01:12:11.380
You see?

01:12:11.380 --> 01:12:14.930
The refraction is
positive this time.

01:12:14.930 --> 01:12:18.490
And the transmission wave
have also positive amplitudes.

01:12:18.490 --> 01:12:22.430
Let's take a look
at this thing again.

01:12:22.430 --> 01:12:25.850
A very nice pulse and you
can see the refraction

01:12:25.850 --> 01:12:28.410
because of this mathematics.

01:12:28.410 --> 01:12:32.420
Interesting thing is that it
match with experimental result.

01:12:32.420 --> 01:12:34.880
And the prediction
was that you are

01:12:34.880 --> 01:12:38.780
going to get the positive
amplitude reflective wave,

01:12:38.780 --> 01:12:44.120
and it does agree with
the experimental data.

01:12:44.120 --> 01:12:46.130
So this is actually
what we have learned.

01:12:46.130 --> 01:12:49.800
So we have learned
traveling wave solution.

01:12:49.800 --> 01:12:52.970
Energy of a oscillating
string, and also

01:12:52.970 --> 01:12:55.460
the potential kinetic energy.

01:12:55.460 --> 01:13:00.320
And also we learn how to
actually match two media

01:13:00.320 --> 01:13:03.660
and passings-- how this
traveling wave pass

01:13:03.660 --> 01:13:05.960
through the median, et cetera.

01:13:05.960 --> 01:13:10.190
And next time we will talk
about more systems described

01:13:10.190 --> 01:13:12.290
by wave equation.

01:13:12.290 --> 01:13:16.430
And also dispersion relation,
what does that mean, et cetera.

01:13:16.430 --> 01:13:20.080
Thank you very much,
and see you on Thursday.

00:00:21.427 --> 00:00:23.760
MICHAEL SHORT: We've actually
got a special guest today.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.430
It's Jake Hecla, one
of the seniors at NSE

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.060
who's gone on to Chernobyl for
the second time, just returned

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.450
from there two weeks ago.

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:33.060
So if you remember
on Tuesday, we

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.160
went through all of the
physics and intuition

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.630
about why Chernobyl happened.

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.280
And we left off on what
does it look like today.

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.905
So Jake is going to tell you
what does it look like today.

00:00:41.905 --> 00:00:43.530
JAKE HECLA: All right,
so first off I'm

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.020
actually going to go over a bit
of the reactor physics involved

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:46.980
with the Chernobyl accident.

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.050
I realize you guys have already
covered this to some extent.

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.500
But I didn't plan for that.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:51.697
So it's in my presentation.

00:00:51.697 --> 00:00:53.280
MICHAEL SHORT: It'll
be a good review.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.990
JAKE HECLA: Yes, also
I am a little sick.

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:59.040
So I'm probably going to
start coughing, apologies.

00:00:59.040 --> 00:00:59.970
I'm not dying.

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:00.870
It's just a cold.

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.152
AUDIENCE: Radiation poisoning.

00:01:02.152 --> 00:01:04.319
JAKE HECLA: I have heard
that joke about eight times

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:05.194
in the last two days.

00:01:05.194 --> 00:01:06.210
And I'm so done with it.

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.233
But yes, it's not
radiation poisoning.

00:01:08.233 --> 00:01:09.150
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.820
JAKE HECLA: Yeah, all
right, where is Chernobyl?

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:14.790
Ah, dang it.

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.260
Come on, no, go the other
way, the other way, yep.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:19.930
OK, there.

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:21.960
OK, so one of the
first questions

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.720
I got when I said I'm going to
go and visit Chernobyl is wait,

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.280
isn't that a war zone?

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.180
Not quite.

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.800
So the Ukrainian,
the war in Ukraine

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.880
is mostly in this
portion over here.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.180
It's not entirely under
Rebel control in that area.

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.830
And I say "rebel"
in quotation marks

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:44.310
because rebel means Russian.

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.440
However, if you
notice those arrows,

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.990
Russian forces are built
up all along that border.

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.530
So while it's not
an active war zone,

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.540
it's certainly not a
place to be spending

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.820
a large amount of time.

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:04.770
That said, Chernobyl is
north of Kiev by about,

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:10.449
I don't know, let's see,
200, 250 kilometers.

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:14.670
So it's not completely
out in the sticks, right.

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.940
Hopefully this gives you good
sense of roughly where it is.

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.310
All right, so what is the
Chernobyl nuclear power plant

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:23.630
look like?

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.420
It consists of four
finished reactors.

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.940
There are two unfinished
reactors, unit 5 and 6, that

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.710
are not shown in this image.

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:34.640
Units 1 and 2 are
located at the right.

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.290
Those were constructed in
the 1970s and early 1980s.

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.090
All of these reactors
or the RBMK type.

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.560
Units 1 and 2 operated
with some success--

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.530
I'll go into that later--

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:55.110
for a number of years before the
accident that happened in 1986.

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:56.900
We also had some call
outs up here that

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.560
show the, some of the
incidents that I'll

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.870
talk about here a little bit
later in the presentation.

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.670
But this just gives you a
general idea of the layout.

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:11.060
So it's two separate
buildings for units 1 and 2.

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.690
And then units 3 and 4 are in
one building, all connected

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:16.640
by this turbo generator hall.

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.490
So this is where
the generators that

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:23.420
turn the steam from
the RBMK into power, r.

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.420
This is one giant--

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:30.420
well, before the accident, this
was one giant, not separated

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:31.660
hallway, basically.

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:36.130
So you could walk from one end
to the other, theoretically.

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:38.135
All right, so what is an RBMK?

00:03:38.135 --> 00:03:43.210
An RBMK is a light water-cooled,
graphite-moderated,

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:44.900
channel-type reactor.

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.860
This means that it does not
have a giant pressure vessel

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:51.430
like you would see in a VVER
or an equivalent American

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.590
light water reactor.

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:54.860
Why does that mean anything?

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:58.120
Well, building giant pressure
vessels is very difficult.

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.490
If any of you've done
research on manufacturing

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:02.980
of nuclear reactors,
you'll find out

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.772
that the equipment necessary
to construct a reactor

00:04:05.772 --> 00:04:07.480
pressure vessel is
not actually something

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.850
we even have in the US anymore.

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:11.820
Is it Korea that
does it for us now?

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:13.195
MICHAEL SHORT:
Japan Steel Works.

00:04:13.195 --> 00:04:15.550
JAKE HECLA: Japan
that does it now.

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:18.790
In the Soviet times, it
was very, very difficult

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:23.860
for the Soviet Union to
produce such pressure vessels

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.480
at any kind of reasonable rate.

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:29.680
So the RBMK got
around this by using

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.500
individual channels that were
their own pressure vessel,

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:33.650
so to speak.

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:36.700
So the way this works is, let's
just start on the cold side.

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:40.240
You take in cold water, goes
here through these things.

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.340
These are main
circulating pumps--

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:43.990
MCPs, as you'll
see them referred

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:45.760
to later in the presentation--

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.930
goes up through the
bottom up the core.

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:50.440
These are the hot fuel rods.

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:55.060
The water goes from liquid
to steam phase as it's

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:59.290
flowing through the
channels, comes out the top,

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:02.260
goes to the steam
water separators.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.810
Steam goes to the turbines,
turns the turbines,

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:06.460
makes electricity.

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:08.860
The important thing
to remember here

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:11.950
is that we've got a
giant graphite core.

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:13.840
The graphite is what
is doing the moderating

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:15.010
in this circumstance.

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:18.220
It is not the water.

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:20.990
This allows you to run
very low-enriched uranium.

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:24.880
So you could
theoretically run an RBMK

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:30.340
on I believe it was 1.2 percent
was as low as they could go.

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:33.150
But regardless, extremely
low-enriched uranium,

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:35.650
which is convenient if you don't
want to waste a lot of time

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:36.400
enriching uranium.

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:44.110
The problem with this is
that you have a giant core.

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:47.150
If you recall the scattering
cross-section for graphite,

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:48.880
it's pretty small.

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:51.040
And the amount of energy
lost per collision

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:53.470
is likewise also fairly small.

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:58.360
So the core on this thing
is, let's see, 11, yeah,

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:01.030
11.5 meters across.

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:04.480
The core for an equivalent
American reactor--

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:07.180
so well, there is no
real equivalent to this--

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:10.720
but for, let's say,
an AP 1000 reactor

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:14.680
of equivalent electrical output,
is about four meters across.

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:16.705
So the core is huge.

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:24.520
As I already discussed, this
is what the individual pressure

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:25.540
channels look like.

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:29.020
So cool water comes in the
bottom, goes by the fuel rods,

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:32.240
pops out the top.

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:34.720
The RBMK had some
serious design flaws.

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:36.610
So as I said, the core is huge.

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:38.590
This allows local
power anomalies

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:41.950
to form really, really easily.

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:43.900
If you look at the
core, one portion

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:46.690
can be kind of neutronically
separated from the others

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:51.010
because neutrons just don't
make it all that far when

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:52.150
diffusing across the core.

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:54.400
So you can have very, very
high power in one corner

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:58.060
and very low power in the other,
which is not something that

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:02.170
can develop in a physically
smaller core, which

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:05.410
has a characteristic
scale equivalent to that

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:06.790
of the neutron being free path.

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:13.460
Further, the encore flux
monitoring on the RBMK

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:15.530
is seriously deficient.

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:18.260
So there are a variety
of neutron detectors

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.630
that exist around the
periphery of the core.

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:23.510
But they're wholly insufficient
to catch these local power

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:24.920
anomalies.

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:27.170
Chernobyl actually found out
the hard way on this one.

00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:32.420
In 1982, unit 1 suffered a
quote "localized core melt,"

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:36.410
not really something that
can happen in LWR, really

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:38.000
any other type of reactor.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.800
But a couple of
the fuel channels

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:42.320
actually experienced
one of these local power

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:44.060
anomalies and ended up melting.

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:47.660
So if you go into the
control room of unit 1,

00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:51.760
you can see that on the fuel
channel cartogram on the wall,

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:53.870
there are two of them that
are just Sharpied out.

00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:56.810
And those are the
ones that melted.

00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:59.917
Further, it has a positive
void reactivity coefficient.

00:07:59.917 --> 00:08:00.750
What does that mean?

00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:03.950
Well, when the water
boils in the core,

00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:06.380
the density of the
water there goes down.

00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:08.660
And the power of
the reactor ends up

00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:10.940
going up because the
water is primarily

00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:13.910
acting not as moderator
but as a neutron absorber.

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:18.230
This is bad for a whole
variety of reasons.

00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:20.570
And they found out
quite catastrophically

00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:22.400
in 1986 exactly why.

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:26.390
Further, the system is
extremely unstable at low power.

00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:34.580
So how did the 1986
accident happen?

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:39.700
It was part of this thing called
a turbo generator rundown test.

00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:44.200
The general idea is that if you
have an off-site power failure,

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:47.650
and your main circulating
pumps are no longer

00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:49.447
have off-site power,
you somehow need

00:08:49.447 --> 00:08:51.280
to keep water flowing
through the core, such

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:53.950
that the fuel does not melt.

00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:57.580
The problem is that the backup,
large diesel generators,

00:08:57.580 --> 00:08:58.180
are just that.

00:08:58.180 --> 00:08:59.030
They're large.

00:08:59.030 --> 00:09:00.040
They're diesel.

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:01.600
And therefore they're
very, very slow

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:04.720
to come online and
come up to full power.

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:06.790
The way that you
can bridge this gap

00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:10.360
is by using the energy that
you've stored in the turbines

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:12.760
to effectively power the
main circulating pumps

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:15.940
until the diesel generators
can come up online.

00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:19.840
When unit 4 was fully
constructed in 1983

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:21.410
and turned on for
the first time,

00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:23.250
they had never
actually done this test

00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:25.210
where they did a turbo
generator rundown,

00:09:25.210 --> 00:09:27.970
despite the fact that it was
required by law in the Soviet

00:09:27.970 --> 00:09:30.670
Union that all new
power stations should

00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:32.370
have this test performed.

00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:35.890
It was delayed until 1986.

00:09:35.890 --> 00:09:43.940
And yeah, it was delayed until
1986 is the long story short.

00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:46.720
The test procedure-- sorry for
all the text on this slide--

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:48.440
is basically as follows.

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:50.320
So you would ramp
the reactor down.

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:52.810
So you would bring it from
a normal thermal output

00:09:52.810 --> 00:09:56.230
of up to 2,400
megawatts thermal,

00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:59.240
down to 600 or 700 megawatts.

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:01.378
You'd bring the turbo
generators up to full speed.

00:10:01.378 --> 00:10:02.920
So you'd store as
much energy in them

00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:06.910
as you possibly could, then
cut off the steam supply such

00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:09.760
that now you are just extracting
energy from the spinning turbo

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:11.242
generator.

00:10:11.242 --> 00:10:13.450
This would then be used to
power the main circulating

00:10:13.450 --> 00:10:16.930
pumps, each of which
took about 40 megawatts.

00:10:16.930 --> 00:10:19.180
There are eight of them total.

00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:23.950
I believe six could be
used for normal operation.

00:10:23.950 --> 00:10:26.080
The rundown would take
somewhere in the range

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:27.940
of 60 to 70 seconds.

00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:30.010
And hopefully by this time
your diesel generators

00:10:30.010 --> 00:10:31.690
would be turned
on, pumping water,

00:10:31.690 --> 00:10:33.740
and everything would be fine.

00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:36.940
What happened in the test
was decidedly quite different

00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:37.840
from that.

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:43.420
So on April 26,
1986, they attempted

00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:46.390
to begin this test about
six hours behind schedule

00:10:46.390 --> 00:10:49.360
because there was an incident
in another part of Ukraine,

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:51.550
in which a coal power
plant went offline.

00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:55.450
So what happened
was the authority

00:10:55.450 --> 00:10:58.450
for the grid in the area
ordered that Chernobyl

00:10:58.450 --> 00:11:03.970
should stay online at full power
for an additional six hours.

00:11:03.970 --> 00:11:06.730
They began the test by
bringing power down.

00:11:06.730 --> 00:11:11.470
But as a result of running
for an extra six hours,

00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:14.260
they'd built up a significant
amount of xenon precursors

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:15.290
in the core.

00:11:15.290 --> 00:11:17.890
So when they started
turning the power down,

00:11:17.890 --> 00:11:21.160
the power started going
down, and down, and down.

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:26.050
And they were unable
to arrest its drop.

00:11:26.050 --> 00:11:29.680
What ended up happening was that
the power dropped all the way

00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:31.870
down to 30 megawatts thermal.

00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:35.330
And the reactor operators
kind of panicked.

00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:38.350
Their response to this,
instead of canceling the test,

00:11:38.350 --> 00:11:40.570
was to pull out as
many control rods

00:11:40.570 --> 00:11:42.220
as they could get
their hands on.

00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:42.940
They did so.

00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:46.840
And this managed to rescue the
thermal output of the reactor.

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:50.170
And it bumped up to around
200 megawatts thermal.

00:11:50.170 --> 00:11:53.440
At this point, the reactor was
in an extremely unstable state.

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:56.170
Mind you, almost all of the rods
that they could get their hands

00:11:56.170 --> 00:11:58.150
on were out of the reactor.

00:11:58.150 --> 00:11:59.950
The only thing
keeping reactivity

00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:01.600
at a reasonable level
was all the xenon

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:04.660
that was built up in the core.

00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:08.410
At this point, they began the
turbo generator run down test.

00:12:08.410 --> 00:12:14.110
They shut off steam to the main
turbine, or one of the turbines

00:12:14.110 --> 00:12:17.560
after it was run
up to full power,

00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:20.350
and then attempted to run
the main circulating pump.

00:12:20.350 --> 00:12:23.500
The main circulating pump
started drawing down the energy

00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:27.040
from the spinning turbine.

00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:29.590
And as a result, it
ran slower and slower,

00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:31.360
meaning that the
flow through the core

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:36.100
was less and less, more water
boiled, going into steam,

00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:39.310
which increased the reactivity.

00:12:39.310 --> 00:12:43.210
As a result, the power
output of the court went up.

00:12:43.210 --> 00:12:44.830
It burned out more xenon.

00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:47.200
And the cycle continued.

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:49.900
They noticed a power
excursion, about 40 seconds

00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:53.440
after they began the
test and at this point

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:55.210
recognize they were
in bad territory

00:12:55.210 --> 00:12:57.430
and hit the scram button.

00:12:57.430 --> 00:13:00.220
This would jam pretty much all
of the available control rods

00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:02.530
into the core, including
some emergency extras,

00:13:02.530 --> 00:13:04.330
and shut everything down.

00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:07.060
In most circumstances, this
would be a fairly safe move.

00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:11.830
But in the case of the RBMK
it was most certainly not.

00:13:11.830 --> 00:13:16.150
RBMK control rods have
a graphite tip on them.

00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:19.570
When jammed into the core,
they caused a localized power

00:13:19.570 --> 00:13:22.990
increase because the graphite
is a great moderator.

00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:26.055
And it is displacing water,
which is a great absorber.

00:13:26.055 --> 00:13:28.180
And as a result, after they
made it a couple meters

00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:32.260
into the core, the
increased pressure

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:36.280
in the core from the
power output, which

00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:38.530
was localized around the
tips the control rods,

00:13:38.530 --> 00:13:42.490
ended up shattering the
control rod drive mechanisms.

00:13:42.490 --> 00:13:47.290
And instead of turning off, the
cycle basically just continued,

00:13:47.290 --> 00:13:49.990
power continued to ramp up over
the next couple of seconds.

00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:52.630
It eventually reached
somewhere around 10 to 20

00:13:52.630 --> 00:13:55.720
times the maximum rated
thermal output of the system.

00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:57.490
And a massive steam
explosion ended up

00:13:57.490 --> 00:13:59.800
ripping through the facility.

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:03.310
It tossed the 2000
ton biological shield

00:14:03.310 --> 00:14:07.150
on top of the reactor through
the roof of the facility.

00:14:07.150 --> 00:14:09.970
It injected a significant
portion of the fuel,

00:14:09.970 --> 00:14:12.460
as well as the
moderator in the core.

00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:15.717
And it started a massive
fire around the facility.

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:19.825
Just to give you a
good sense of scale,

00:14:19.825 --> 00:14:22.810
let's see, if I've got
the virtual laser pointer.

00:14:22.810 --> 00:14:27.040
That's a person right
here, this little guy.

00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:29.980
This is the top of
the biological shield,

00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:32.380
Elena shield.

00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:37.420
And then this is a model, a
cutaway model of the Chernobyl

00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:41.410
reactor facility
with the shield,

00:14:41.410 --> 00:14:46.140
and with the flipped shield
that went up through the roof

00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:47.760
and came back down.

00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:50.780
So as you can see, it was an
utterly massive explosion.

00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:58.480
So the damage to the reactor was
immediately quite catastrophic.

00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:00.340
Moderator blocks,
fuel was spread

00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:02.290
all around the immediate area.

00:15:02.290 --> 00:15:04.910
If you look in this photo,
it's rather difficult to see.

00:15:04.910 --> 00:15:07.330
But at the bottom of
that column of smoke

00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:11.410
you can actually see the bottom
up the biological shield.

00:15:11.410 --> 00:15:13.660
Kind of gives you a
sense of the scale

00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:15.840
of the damage to the reactor.

00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:18.340
After the explosion happened,
actually none of the operators

00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:21.713
believe the reactor breached
confinement in any way.

00:15:21.713 --> 00:15:23.380
They didn't really
have an immediate way

00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:25.120
of seeing what had happened.

00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:27.580
So they open the door and went
to the main turbo generator

00:15:27.580 --> 00:15:29.320
building to
investigate the damage.

00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:32.590
They believed it was perhaps one
or two ruptured fuel channels.

00:15:32.590 --> 00:15:34.683
As it happened at, I
believe the Leningrad,

00:15:34.683 --> 00:15:36.100
I think it was the
Leningrad power

00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:38.333
station a few years earlier.

00:15:38.333 --> 00:15:40.000
In the few seconds
that they were there,

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.760
they received fatal doses
and died in the hospital

00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:45.040
in May of 1986.

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:48.040
This is a photo from
control room of reactor 4,

00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:51.760
showing a jammed control rod
drive at the 6 meter position.

00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:54.520
So this was probably
a rod, let's see,

00:15:54.520 --> 00:16:00.340
this is probably a rod coming
up from the bottom, in that it,

00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:02.020
seven meters would
be all the way out.

00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:03.520
Zero meters would
be all the way in.

00:16:07.010 --> 00:16:09.230
The initial response to
this, despite the fact

00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:11.780
that the reactor
operators were not

00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:13.610
yet dead, did
realize that it was

00:16:13.610 --> 00:16:15.500
a full breach of
containment, was

00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:18.300
the response was to an accident
that was non-nuclear in nature.

00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:21.740
So when the fire department
got a call from the authority

00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:25.580
at Chernobyl, the message
that they received

00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:28.490
was there's a fire at
the reactor complex.

00:16:28.490 --> 00:16:31.400
As a result, what
they showed up with

00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:38.510
was not equipment suitable for
a hazmat situation in any way.

00:16:38.510 --> 00:16:40.160
That said, there's
pretty much nothing

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:43.778
that could shield anyone from
the extremely high radiation

00:16:43.778 --> 00:16:45.320
field that one would
encounter around

00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:47.820
the reactor in the immediate
aftermath of the accident.

00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:54.200
But nonetheless, they
were extremely vulnerable.

00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:56.240
It was night when this
accident happened.

00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:59.870
As I mentioned, this happened
at 1:23 in the morning.

00:16:59.870 --> 00:17:02.960
They actually couldn't see
the extent of the accident.

00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:05.060
And they initially
believed that it was just

00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:07.585
a fire on the roof of the
turbo generator building.

00:17:07.585 --> 00:17:08.960
They attempted to
fight the fire.

00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:10.619
And some of them
actually succumb

00:17:10.619 --> 00:17:14.000
to acute radiation poisoning,
or acute radiation syndrome,

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.910
almost immediately.

00:17:16.910 --> 00:17:18.810
A number of firefighters
went up on the roof

00:17:18.810 --> 00:17:19.893
and just didn't come back.

00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:26.589
The aftermath of the
accident, the cleanup

00:17:26.589 --> 00:17:29.380
was handled by the Soviet Army.

00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:31.330
The people that were
involved in this

00:17:31.330 --> 00:17:33.910
were known as the liquidators.

00:17:33.910 --> 00:17:37.450
They would spend several minutes
on the rooftop of the turbo

00:17:37.450 --> 00:17:40.840
generator building, or up
near where the reactor was,

00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:42.730
the reactor containment
building was.

00:17:42.730 --> 00:17:48.440
And they would receive a,
effectively a lifetime dose,

00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:52.750
which I believe was, I believe
their limit was 50 REM.

00:17:52.750 --> 00:17:56.230
And that would be a couple
of minutes up there.

00:17:56.230 --> 00:18:01.060
Let's see, this photo doesn't
show much evidence of it.

00:18:01.060 --> 00:18:03.498
But I suppose it shows a
little bit of evidence of it.

00:18:03.498 --> 00:18:05.290
If you look around the
bottom up the frame,

00:18:05.290 --> 00:18:06.970
you can actually
see a little bit

00:18:06.970 --> 00:18:09.310
of hazing in kind of
a periodic fashion.

00:18:09.310 --> 00:18:15.440
Let's see if I can get my
pointer on it here, here, here,

00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:16.570
here, and here.

00:18:16.570 --> 00:18:19.810
That's the gear that
moves the film is actually

00:18:19.810 --> 00:18:23.590
shielding the film
from radiation

00:18:23.590 --> 00:18:25.360
exposure at those points.

00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:27.880
The radiation dose rate
was so high up there

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:30.070
that most of the pictures
that were taken just

00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:32.590
didn't turn out whatsoever.

00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:36.160
A few smarter photographers
used a whole lot of lead

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:38.060
and were able to capture
photos like this.

00:18:38.060 --> 00:18:40.990
But nonetheless, the dose
rates were tremendous.

00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:47.780
The reactor structure itself
was entombed in this thing

00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:50.000
that we call the sarcophagus.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.940
People in Ukraine call
it the object shelter,

00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:53.330
or the shelter object.

00:18:53.330 --> 00:18:56.810
It was constructed in
starting almost immediately

00:18:56.810 --> 00:19:01.790
after the accident, basically
to keep radioactive graphite

00:19:01.790 --> 00:19:05.300
and fuel fragments from
leaving the reactor structure

00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:07.800
and contaminating any more land.

00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:11.750
This is a photo from when
it was under construction.

00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:15.080
Basically what it consisted of
were steel and concrete walls

00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:18.290
that were erected
around the reactor,

00:19:18.290 --> 00:19:20.360
using a variety of technologies.

00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:24.290
They at first attempted
to use robots,

00:19:24.290 --> 00:19:27.860
that were almost
immediately rendered useless

00:19:27.860 --> 00:19:30.350
by the high radiation field.

00:19:30.350 --> 00:19:35.000
Later on, they ended up using
quote "bio robots," people,

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.720
to move things into place.

00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:40.820
As I've said before,
a whole lot of people

00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:46.250
died in this accident both
immediately and after,

00:19:46.250 --> 00:19:49.550
many during the construction
of the sarcophagus.

00:19:49.550 --> 00:19:51.560
Actually during the
initial firefighting,

00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:53.930
or yeah, the initial
firefighting measures,

00:19:53.930 --> 00:19:56.780
as the core remained burning
for a number of weeks

00:19:56.780 --> 00:20:00.470
after the accident,
they attempted

00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:04.610
to put it out with bags of
sand dropped from helicopters.

00:20:04.610 --> 00:20:08.090
And during that effort,
a helicopter actually

00:20:08.090 --> 00:20:09.680
ended up hitting
one of the cranes

00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:11.600
that they were attempting
to use for this

00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:14.360
and falling into the
reactor, and a good portion

00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:17.390
of its remains remain entombed
within the sarcophagus,

00:20:17.390 --> 00:20:21.130
from what I understand.

00:20:21.130 --> 00:20:24.710
All right, so my visit to
Chernobyl, why would anyone

00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:26.360
ever want to go there?

00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:27.980
The primary focus
was to learn about

00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:31.220
radiological
decontamination at the site,

00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:34.250
basically how is
contamination control managed,

00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:35.588
how do workers stay safe.

00:20:35.588 --> 00:20:37.130
Mind you, there are
3,000 people that

00:20:37.130 --> 00:20:40.160
go to work there every day.

00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:41.630
And what are the strengths?

00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:44.495
And what are the shortcomings
of their radiological program?

00:20:44.495 --> 00:20:49.010
It was seven days total,
four of which were on site.

00:20:49.010 --> 00:20:52.970
Other days were spent
in Pripyat as well as

00:20:52.970 --> 00:20:57.320
in some classroom training,
which I've got great photos of.

00:20:57.320 --> 00:21:00.260
So this is a slide stolen
directly from the PowerPoint

00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:02.730
that I was sent on day one.

00:21:02.730 --> 00:21:06.650
But this was organized by
three people, Carl Willis,

00:21:06.650 --> 00:21:08.810
Erik Kambarian, and Ed Geist.

00:21:08.810 --> 00:21:10.400
I've known Carl for
a few years now.

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:13.070
He lives in
Albuquerque, New Mexico

00:21:13.070 --> 00:21:15.530
and is a radiation safety
officer at a company

00:21:15.530 --> 00:21:20.030
that, I think they do advanced
energy storage technologies.

00:21:20.030 --> 00:21:22.070
I'm not exactly sure.

00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:26.300
Erik is a firefighter and
specializes in radiation

00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:27.500
emergency response.

00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:30.830
And Edward works at
the Rand Corporation

00:21:30.830 --> 00:21:33.935
and does nuclear history and
nuclear security research.

00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:39.760
This is the team this year.

00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:41.880
So we've got, let's start here.

00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:42.570
This is Lucas.

00:21:42.570 --> 00:21:45.300
He does environmental
radiation monitoring.

00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:48.990
That's me after having no sleep
because I did a 22.611 p-set

00:21:48.990 --> 00:21:50.770
the night before.

00:21:50.770 --> 00:21:51.270
I know.

00:21:51.270 --> 00:21:53.160
I looked so happy to be there.

00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:54.360
This is Nathan.

00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:59.340
Nathan builds organs, as
in the musical instrument.

00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:00.900
He was along because
he's always been

00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:03.720
interested in Chernobyl
but didn't really have

00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:06.480
any experience in the field.

00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:08.070
This is Stanislaus.

00:22:08.070 --> 00:22:11.670
Stanislaus was our guide
from the Chernobyl authority.

00:22:11.670 --> 00:22:13.860
He's been working at
the plant since 1991

00:22:13.860 --> 00:22:17.400
and is a fantastic
resource for information.

00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:20.240
This is Ed, who I believe
I talked about earlier.

00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:22.260
And this is Ryan Pierce.

00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:23.670
I'm not really
sure what he does.

00:22:23.670 --> 00:22:29.310
This is Iris, who is a friend
of Carl's and works in,

00:22:29.310 --> 00:22:31.500
believe radiation oncology.

00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:37.240
And then Danell Hogan, who's
an educator based in Phoenix,

00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:38.610
Arizona who works with the DOE.

00:22:40.857 --> 00:22:42.690
By the way if you're
wondering why we're all

00:22:42.690 --> 00:22:44.760
wearing those absurd
robes before we

00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:48.060
were going to go
in to another room

00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:52.350
and change into basically
coveralls, which

00:22:52.350 --> 00:22:55.295
are easy to decontaminate.

00:22:55.295 --> 00:22:56.670
One of the activities
that we did

00:22:56.670 --> 00:22:58.890
was real decontamination
training.

00:22:58.890 --> 00:23:02.610
So that is a truck from
the Novarka work site,

00:23:02.610 --> 00:23:06.300
which, by the way, that is
me with a Geiger counter.

00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:08.970
I'm surveying for contamination.

00:23:08.970 --> 00:23:11.357
We then pressure
washed the truck.

00:23:11.357 --> 00:23:13.440
As it turns out, there's
a very specific technique

00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:15.815
one needs to use for pressure
washing when you're dealing

00:23:15.815 --> 00:23:19.650
with a contaminated object, so
as to not blast contaminated

00:23:19.650 --> 00:23:22.180
dirt up back onto the truck.

00:23:22.180 --> 00:23:24.480
This was a very interesting
experience and also

00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:27.120
one that was very entertaining
for the workers involved,

00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:30.300
because they don't actually
wear that when they're

00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:35.100
doing decontamination because
their respect for safety

00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:38.220
protocols are, shall we
say, a bit different.

00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:40.950
So they got to see us
where the absurd rubber

00:23:40.950 --> 00:23:46.890
ducky suits while they stood
by smoking and laughing at us.

00:23:46.890 --> 00:23:49.810
I believe you can actually see
the corner of that guy's jacket

00:23:49.810 --> 00:23:50.310
back there.

00:23:50.310 --> 00:23:52.860
And he's just wearing
everyday clothes.

00:23:55.700 --> 00:23:58.640
We also went on the new
safe confinement work site.

00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:01.160
So I haven't talked about it
earlier in this presentation,

00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:03.440
but I suppose I should have.

00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:07.640
There is a object called
the New Safe Confinement

00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:12.890
Arch that consists of basically
a giant stainless steel

00:24:12.890 --> 00:24:16.940
structure on rails which is
being slid over reactor 4

00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:19.490
so as to prevent the spread
of any sort of contamination

00:24:19.490 --> 00:24:20.780
from it.

00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:25.550
This is known as the New Safe
Confinement, or NSC, arch.

00:24:25.550 --> 00:24:28.430
It's been under
construction since 2007.

00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:31.580
And it just moved
for the first time,

00:24:31.580 --> 00:24:36.860
actually while I was there,
so on the 12th of November.

00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:40.940
It's supposed to
last for 100 years.

00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:42.830
And hopefully in that
kind of time span

00:24:42.830 --> 00:24:46.430
they'll be able to take apart
what remains of the reactor.

00:24:46.430 --> 00:24:51.770
So actually what you see here is
the corner of the sarcophagus.

00:24:51.770 --> 00:24:55.430
And then if you were to pan
over this way a little bit,

00:24:55.430 --> 00:25:00.350
you'd see the right set
of tracks for the New Safe

00:25:00.350 --> 00:25:03.040
Confinement Arch.

00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:05.803
We also did some
classroom training.

00:25:05.803 --> 00:25:07.220
Admittedly, the
classroom training

00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:10.490
was the most disappointing
part of this.

00:25:10.490 --> 00:25:13.130
The instructors were
not particularly

00:25:13.130 --> 00:25:15.740
interested in showing
us really anything

00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:21.380
other than YouTube videos and
other things that would just

00:25:21.380 --> 00:25:22.760
waste our time.

00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:26.267
That was the one part of this
trip that I did not enjoy.

00:25:26.267 --> 00:25:28.100
Regardless, we did get
to learn a little bit

00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:32.240
about the various hazmat
getups that folks would

00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:36.280
wear when working on site.

00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:41.050
As I mentioned we also
got to visit Pripyat,

00:25:41.050 --> 00:25:43.090
which I have more
photos of later,

00:25:43.090 --> 00:25:45.970
as well as the reactor
4 control room, which

00:25:45.970 --> 00:25:50.290
is inside the sarcophagus,
which is quite a treat to visit.

00:25:50.290 --> 00:25:52.870
The reactor 4
control room is not

00:25:52.870 --> 00:25:56.080
terribly contaminated as a
result of the decontamination

00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:57.190
efforts.

00:25:57.190 --> 00:25:59.050
During the accident,
the dose rate

00:25:59.050 --> 00:26:03.100
would have been somewhere in the
range of 5 to 10 rem an hour.

00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:06.580
But today, it's in the
range of 10 mrem an hour.

00:26:09.078 --> 00:26:10.620
This is the New Safe
Confinement Arch

00:26:10.620 --> 00:26:11.828
that I've been talking about.

00:26:11.828 --> 00:26:15.390
This is actually a photo from
2015 with a clip art Statue

00:26:15.390 --> 00:26:18.210
of Liberty on it, but to
give you an idea of how huge

00:26:18.210 --> 00:26:24.240
it is, 5 meters taller
than the Statue of Liberty.

00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:26.680
And it's on rails,
which is interesting.

00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:28.530
It's actually too
big for wheels.

00:26:28.530 --> 00:26:31.560
So it's not on rails
like with wheels on them.

00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:33.585
It's on rails with
giant Teflon scoots.

00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:39.355
This is the inside of the
turbo generator hallway.

00:26:39.355 --> 00:26:41.230
Remember that long
building that I showed you

00:26:41.230 --> 00:26:44.980
that connected reactors
1 and 2 and 3 and 4?

00:26:44.980 --> 00:26:47.530
This is right outside
the reactor 3 part of it.

00:26:47.530 --> 00:26:50.680
There are-- I think I'll
show you these photos later.

00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:55.870
There are chunks of the
turbine from reactor 4

00:26:55.870 --> 00:27:01.090
that are down here in this
area that are quite visibly

00:27:01.090 --> 00:27:05.080
radioactive and are very easy
to detect if one swings a Geiger

00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:06.340
counter about.

00:27:06.340 --> 00:27:10.490
Within Pripyat we also
visited a hospital 126,

00:27:10.490 --> 00:27:12.970
which is where the
firefighters went immediately

00:27:12.970 --> 00:27:18.010
after the accident, that is, the
ones that made it off the roof.

00:27:18.010 --> 00:27:21.352
This garment here,
we're not exactly

00:27:21.352 --> 00:27:22.810
sure what it was
because none of us

00:27:22.810 --> 00:27:24.130
were going to really touch it.

00:27:24.130 --> 00:27:27.250
But we think it might have
been part of a cover--

00:27:27.250 --> 00:27:28.720
it would go under one's helmet--

00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:31.120
was extremely radioactive.

00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:34.680
It was contaminated with
alpha, beta, and gamma,

00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:35.680
which is fairly unusual.

00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:39.550
Alpha contamination is fairly
rare around the Chernobyl site,

00:27:39.550 --> 00:27:43.390
and was somewhere around 50
to 75 mR an hour on contact.

00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:50.090
I think I already showed
you photos the control room.

00:27:50.090 --> 00:27:51.920
Yep, unit 4, that's
the cartogram,

00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:55.890
so that would display various
parameters of the reactor

00:27:55.890 --> 00:28:00.570
for each fuel channel, depending
on how one configured it.

00:28:00.570 --> 00:28:02.550
That's an external photo
of the sarcophagus.

00:28:05.610 --> 00:28:09.540
And I think that's it for
the PowerPoint slides.

00:28:09.540 --> 00:28:11.750
I do have a bunch of
photos though that I think

00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:13.320
you will find interesting.

00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:15.300
I apologize if it's a
little disorganized.

00:28:18.270 --> 00:28:22.890
This was put together relatively
recently because, well, I

00:28:22.890 --> 00:28:24.930
just got back from Chernobyl.

00:28:24.930 --> 00:28:26.520
And then I went to a conference.

00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:29.250
And then I came back here
and tried to get work done.

00:28:29.250 --> 00:28:33.270
Right, so these are in
chronological order roughly.

00:28:33.270 --> 00:28:35.370
I'll go through and
hopefully tell you guys

00:28:35.370 --> 00:28:38.015
a little bit about
what the site's like.

00:28:38.015 --> 00:28:39.140
MICHAEL SHORT: [INAUDIBLE].

00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:42.000
JAKE HECLA: OK, so
this is on day one.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:46.470
We're driving to the Chernobyl
nuclear power plant site.

00:28:46.470 --> 00:28:48.630
That blue and white
bus is pretty much

00:28:48.630 --> 00:28:50.610
what everyone uses for
transport around there.

00:28:53.370 --> 00:28:55.030
All right, so we're
not really supposed

00:28:55.030 --> 00:28:56.350
to be taking photos
in this area.

00:28:56.350 --> 00:28:57.850
So everything is
tilted because it's

00:28:57.850 --> 00:29:00.610
taking them out the window
with the camera like that.

00:29:00.610 --> 00:29:03.130
That's the New Safe
Confinement Arch.

00:29:03.130 --> 00:29:04.630
It's in considerably
better shape

00:29:04.630 --> 00:29:06.580
than it was last
year at this time.

00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:09.190
They have done a fantastic
job of putting it together.

00:29:09.190 --> 00:29:13.290
It's actually almost a
year ahead of schedule.

00:29:13.290 --> 00:29:14.140
There it is, again.

00:29:14.140 --> 00:29:17.230
You can see the sarcophagus
with the new support wall,

00:29:17.230 --> 00:29:20.730
which is that right there.

00:29:29.910 --> 00:29:32.280
All right, so this is our
excursion into Pripyat

00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:33.990
on our second day.

00:29:33.990 --> 00:29:37.020
So this is the group
led by Stanislaus.

00:29:37.020 --> 00:29:40.500
As you can see, there's
not very much left.

00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:42.780
Just in comparison to
what we saw last year,

00:29:42.780 --> 00:29:45.990
the number of buildings
that had been taken apart

00:29:45.990 --> 00:29:51.210
for scrap metal, illegally,
of course, was pretty huge.

00:29:51.210 --> 00:29:52.925
In, I don't know,
5 or 10 years, it's

00:29:52.925 --> 00:29:55.300
going to be very difficult to
see much of Pripyat at all,

00:29:55.300 --> 00:29:56.850
frankly.

00:29:56.850 --> 00:30:00.210
So this is a standard
apartment block in Pripyat.

00:30:00.210 --> 00:30:03.180
As you can see, a lot
of broken windows.

00:30:03.180 --> 00:30:04.793
A lot of bricks have fallen off.

00:30:04.793 --> 00:30:06.210
These things are
pretty dangerous.

00:30:06.210 --> 00:30:07.950
A lot of tourists
do go into them.

00:30:07.950 --> 00:30:11.060
If one decides to do a tourist
expedition to Chernobyl-- which

00:30:11.060 --> 00:30:13.290
I don't particularly
recommend-- don't

00:30:13.290 --> 00:30:14.415
go in the apartment blocks.

00:30:17.370 --> 00:30:20.370
This is on the way to
one of the schools.

00:30:20.370 --> 00:30:24.250
This is Lucas who has more
detectors than anyone I've ever

00:30:24.250 --> 00:30:24.750
met.

00:30:24.750 --> 00:30:26.710
He was wearing 7 at the time.

00:30:26.710 --> 00:30:29.340
So I had to take a photo of him.

00:30:29.340 --> 00:30:32.040
This is Iris imitating
some of the graffiti, which

00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:34.830
unfortunately has popped
up all over the place.

00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:38.230
Pripyat itself is
really decaying quickly.

00:30:38.230 --> 00:30:42.180
As I've said, there's a
huge problem with looting.

00:30:42.180 --> 00:30:43.680
In addition, there's
a huge problem

00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:46.230
with graffiti and vandalism.

00:30:46.230 --> 00:30:48.330
It's really
depressing, honestly,

00:30:48.330 --> 00:30:54.090
to go there and see how much
has changed just in a year.

00:30:54.090 --> 00:30:55.920
So despite my
earlier warning, we

00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:57.150
did go in an apartment block.

00:31:01.830 --> 00:31:03.780
This is just a
measurement showing

00:31:03.780 --> 00:31:06.570
that the background up there
actually is not terribly high.

00:31:09.330 --> 00:31:13.240
Yeah, that's Iris, not
particularly safety conscious

00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:15.960
at times.

00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:17.710
This gives you a good
idea of how far away

00:31:17.710 --> 00:31:19.233
Pripyat is from the reactor.

00:31:19.233 --> 00:31:21.025
That is not very far,
about two kilometers.

00:31:21.025 --> 00:31:23.050
So you can see the New
Safe Confinement Arch

00:31:23.050 --> 00:31:26.650
to the top left of the detector.

00:31:26.650 --> 00:31:29.650
Background there is about,
in this particular apartment

00:31:29.650 --> 00:31:32.530
block, at this particular
time, was about four to five

00:31:32.530 --> 00:31:36.292
times what you would see
in downtown Cambridge.

00:31:39.740 --> 00:31:42.000
There are wild
animals in Pripyat

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.160
and the rest of
the exclusion zone.

00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:45.570
This is a huge problem.

00:31:45.570 --> 00:31:48.300
So despite the fact that
the cats are very cute

00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:51.770
and the puppies are very
cute, they also have rabies,

00:31:51.770 --> 00:31:54.630
not all of them, but a
very large number of them.

00:31:54.630 --> 00:31:58.140
In 2009, five workers were
injured by, I kid you not,

00:31:58.140 --> 00:31:59.412
a rabid wolf.

00:31:59.412 --> 00:32:00.870
There's a YouTube
video of this you

00:32:00.870 --> 00:32:04.320
can look up on your own
time if you so wish.

00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:07.300
This is because Ukraine
doesn't have a lot of money.

00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:11.320
So they have not been able to
continue with their vaccination

00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:11.820
program.

00:32:11.820 --> 00:32:17.700
They actually use baits that
have a rabies vaccine in them

00:32:17.700 --> 00:32:22.290
to normally suppress rabies
in wild animal populations.

00:32:22.290 --> 00:32:23.820
But Ukraine doesn't
have any money.

00:32:23.820 --> 00:32:26.410
They killed the program
about five years ago.

00:32:26.410 --> 00:32:29.220
And as a result there's a
huge, huge problem with,

00:32:29.220 --> 00:32:30.870
especially rabid foxes.

00:32:30.870 --> 00:32:36.360
Because everyone thinks foxes
are cute, especially tourists.

00:32:36.360 --> 00:32:38.700
And foxes, when they
get rabies, some of them

00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:41.400
go through a stage in which
they appear to be very friendly.

00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:43.230
As far as I know,
no one has gotten

00:32:43.230 --> 00:32:46.770
rabies from a rabid
animal at Chernobyl.

00:32:46.770 --> 00:32:50.250
But it's certainly
a possibility.

00:32:50.250 --> 00:32:54.540
So Stanislaus was being a very
bad example by feeding one

00:32:54.540 --> 00:32:57.480
of the wild cats.

00:32:57.480 --> 00:33:00.425
So that's why I took
a picture of it.

00:33:00.425 --> 00:33:01.800
This is one of
the many memorials

00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:03.450
that you'll find in
downtown Slavutych.

00:33:03.450 --> 00:33:05.880
We stayed in the city that
was built, effectively,

00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:07.530
as a replacement for Pripyat.

00:33:07.530 --> 00:33:09.660
It's actually a fantastic town.

00:33:09.660 --> 00:33:12.900
I really enjoy Slavutych.

00:33:12.900 --> 00:33:15.780
And as one might expect,
there are memorials

00:33:15.780 --> 00:33:18.810
everywhere because the entire
population is basically

00:33:18.810 --> 00:33:24.060
the folks that were removed
from the town of Pripyat.

00:33:24.060 --> 00:33:26.700
This is the train we
would take every day.

00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:30.750
Slavutych is
separated from Pripyat

00:33:30.750 --> 00:33:34.240
by a little isthmus of
Belarus that drops down.

00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:38.040
So that's bad, because you
can't get a visa to Belarus.

00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:41.240
It's not really a thing
you can do as an American.

00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:42.490
I mean, you can apply for one.

00:33:42.490 --> 00:33:44.310
You'll just never hear back.

00:33:44.310 --> 00:33:46.710
Belarus is Europe's
last dictatorship.

00:33:46.710 --> 00:33:50.830
And it's not some place one
wants to go for any reason.

00:33:50.830 --> 00:33:54.267
So when we would get on this
train, the doors would shut.

00:33:54.267 --> 00:33:56.100
We would go through
Belarus and we would all

00:33:56.100 --> 00:33:58.535
pray that didn't break
down because then we

00:33:58.535 --> 00:34:00.660
would have to spend some
time to Belarus in prison.

00:34:00.660 --> 00:34:02.790
But yeah, this is the train
yard, bright and early.

00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:10.130
The various zones on the
reactor site for cleanliness,

00:34:10.130 --> 00:34:11.929
so to speak,
radiological cleanliness

00:34:11.929 --> 00:34:15.325
are separated by these
benches effectively,

00:34:15.325 --> 00:34:18.409
that you have to step over, so
that it reminds you that, hey,

00:34:18.409 --> 00:34:20.120
this is the clean area.

00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:23.330
You need to be wearing
boot covers and at least

00:34:23.330 --> 00:34:24.800
these garments in
order to go here.

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:32.745
Sideways, for some reason,
this is part of the--

00:34:32.745 --> 00:34:34.870
all right, I don't know
why these are all sideways.

00:34:34.870 --> 00:34:37.810
But regardless, you
get the picture.

00:34:37.810 --> 00:34:40.030
If you notice on the
top of the screen, which

00:34:40.030 --> 00:34:41.409
should be the left
of the screen,

00:34:41.409 --> 00:34:43.120
let's see if I can rotate it.

00:34:46.150 --> 00:34:48.130
That's a giant puddle of water.

00:34:48.130 --> 00:34:49.929
This place is falling apart.

00:34:49.929 --> 00:34:51.520
Despite the fact
that they have money

00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:56.139
from the European bank on
reconstruction and development

00:34:56.139 --> 00:34:57.970
for the New Safe
Confinement Arch,

00:34:57.970 --> 00:35:01.760
the Chernobyl site itself
does not have a lot of money.

00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:04.210
And as a result things
are falling apart.

00:35:04.210 --> 00:35:05.710
And the amount of
contamination that

00:35:05.710 --> 00:35:08.290
is getting into places where
it very much shouldn't be,

00:35:08.290 --> 00:35:11.290
like this quote "clean
area," is fairly high.

00:35:11.290 --> 00:35:14.300
That puddle of water was pretty
toasty, something like 5 to 8

00:35:14.300 --> 00:35:17.670
mR an hour on contact.

00:35:17.670 --> 00:35:19.060
That's generally quite bad.

00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:24.140
As I said, water is
coming in everywhere.

00:35:24.140 --> 00:35:28.480
And in this case they were using
leg covers to catch the water.

00:35:31.578 --> 00:35:33.870
Another one of the hallways
that had water leak into it

00:35:33.870 --> 00:35:36.976
and therefore all
the lights are out.

00:35:36.976 --> 00:35:39.170
That's the footwear
which we were issued,

00:35:39.170 --> 00:35:43.030
which breaks after walking
about a kilometer, which is not

00:35:43.030 --> 00:35:47.440
particularly encouraging if one
wants to take their boots back.

00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:49.750
Again, walking down
the hallway, you

00:35:49.750 --> 00:35:51.760
notice this gold
corrugated material

00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:53.680
that you see on the sides?

00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:56.350
It's aluminum that is anodized.

00:35:56.350 --> 00:35:58.150
And it's placed there
because it covers up

00:35:58.150 --> 00:36:02.350
all of the sheets of lead
that were affixed to the wall.

00:36:02.350 --> 00:36:05.680
What happened is in the
aftermath of the accident,

00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:08.710
the entire facility was just
hopelessly contaminated.

00:36:08.710 --> 00:36:11.860
And you can scrub all you
want, but ultimately it's

00:36:11.860 --> 00:36:14.500
very difficult to get
radioactive contamination off

00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:15.360
of things.

00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:17.110
So what they ended up
doing was getting it

00:36:17.110 --> 00:36:19.300
down to a somewhat
acceptable level,

00:36:19.300 --> 00:36:21.460
and then fastening
sheets of lead over it,

00:36:21.460 --> 00:36:24.520
and then fastening this
stuff over the top of that.

00:36:27.510 --> 00:36:29.160
This is unit 2's control room.

00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:31.260
So this is what a fully
fleshed-out control

00:36:31.260 --> 00:36:32.010
room looks like.

00:36:35.010 --> 00:36:38.940
Unit 2 were shut down in 2000.

00:36:38.940 --> 00:36:41.160
The reactors actually
continued operating

00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:44.070
after the 1986
Chernobyl accident

00:36:44.070 --> 00:36:47.580
because Ukraine was in such
desperate need of power.

00:36:47.580 --> 00:36:50.730
As a result, the fuel
is still fairly hot.

00:36:50.730 --> 00:36:53.640
It's producing a reasonable
amount of decay heat.

00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:57.120
And there is a crew that
sits in the control room

00:36:57.120 --> 00:37:00.440
at all times monitoring it.

00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:03.000
That's Nathan.

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:04.750
This is actually, I
took a picture of this

00:37:04.750 --> 00:37:08.230
because it's a very good
diagram of the Chernobyl reactor

00:37:08.230 --> 00:37:10.570
that's simplified.

00:37:10.570 --> 00:37:13.750
It shows the core and
the relative locations

00:37:13.750 --> 00:37:19.260
of these steam,
water separators.

00:37:19.260 --> 00:37:23.870
OK, as I said, there is a
team that stays in there.

00:37:23.870 --> 00:37:27.670
So there are people that work
on site and work in the reactor

00:37:27.670 --> 00:37:29.980
control rooms, which
I have to imagine

00:37:29.980 --> 00:37:34.040
has to be a bit
of a surreal job.

00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:40.340
This is inside the main, inside
the turbo generator hall.

00:37:40.340 --> 00:37:46.970
Those chunks that you see here
are from the turbo generator

00:37:46.970 --> 00:37:49.370
of reactor 4.

00:37:49.370 --> 00:37:52.370
So they're quite contaminated
and quite easy to detect.

00:37:52.370 --> 00:37:54.620
Actually, there is a
good story behind this.

00:37:54.620 --> 00:37:58.370
So we were trying to
figure out exactly what was

00:37:58.370 --> 00:38:02.930
making the dose rate so high in
the area when we were up there.

00:38:02.930 --> 00:38:07.170
So we got a group of us to stand
in a circle, minus one person.

00:38:07.170 --> 00:38:08.060
So there's a gap.

00:38:08.060 --> 00:38:10.780
We got a person in the
center with a scintillator.

00:38:10.780 --> 00:38:12.860
And we all kind
of rotated around

00:38:12.860 --> 00:38:14.422
until we found in
which direction

00:38:14.422 --> 00:38:16.880
the scintillator reading was
high enough, so basically made

00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:20.180
like a 2 pi meat shield.

00:38:20.180 --> 00:38:21.350
It worked fairly well.

00:38:21.350 --> 00:38:25.170
It thoroughly baffled all of
the guides that were with us.

00:38:25.170 --> 00:38:27.920
They were like, what are
you doing linking arms

00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:29.900
and spinning around.

00:38:29.900 --> 00:38:32.240
Regardless, that is a
good way to find sources

00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:33.230
if you're in a pinch.

00:38:35.790 --> 00:38:37.410
This is looking
the other direction

00:38:37.410 --> 00:38:41.250
from that same vantage
point as in the last photo.

00:38:41.250 --> 00:38:44.010
Behind those walls with a
little radiation signs on them

00:38:44.010 --> 00:38:49.440
are chunks of the ventilation
stack, which is fairly iconic.

00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:51.870
They've been fairly
well decontaminated.

00:38:51.870 --> 00:38:56.040
At that fence area, the
dose rate or more accurately

00:38:56.040 --> 00:39:00.030
exposure rate,
was 10 mR an hour.

00:39:00.030 --> 00:39:02.760
And yeah, that's another
close up photo of it.

00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:05.670
And I managed to sneak by
phone over the top of it

00:39:05.670 --> 00:39:07.050
and get a good shot.

00:39:07.050 --> 00:39:09.210
Unfortunately, none of
the pieces are uncovered.

00:39:09.210 --> 00:39:12.060
I would really like to
see the orange and white

00:39:12.060 --> 00:39:14.490
of the ventilation stack.

00:39:14.490 --> 00:39:17.740
But I did not.

00:39:17.740 --> 00:39:19.740
Again, same shot,
slightly different

00:39:19.740 --> 00:39:22.140
shot of the turbo generator
hallway looking in the unit

00:39:22.140 --> 00:39:25.570
1 2 direction.

00:39:25.570 --> 00:39:33.380
More detritus, oh here's
a slightly better close

00:39:33.380 --> 00:39:35.672
up of those components.

00:39:38.020 --> 00:39:40.520
One of the interesting things
I found out about the facility

00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:42.480
is way that access
is controlled.

00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:46.110
So instead of having an RFID
card or something like that,

00:39:46.110 --> 00:39:47.940
they've got cameras
and operators.

00:39:47.940 --> 00:39:53.360
So what you see
here is a camera.

00:39:53.360 --> 00:39:57.500
So Stanislaus would scan a badge
that would automatically call

00:39:57.500 --> 00:40:00.020
someone who is an operator.

00:40:00.020 --> 00:40:02.270
Stanislaus would say,
hey, I'm at this door.

00:40:02.270 --> 00:40:04.938
I want to go into this location.

00:40:04.938 --> 00:40:05.730
Will you let me in?

00:40:05.730 --> 00:40:07.355
And then they would
look at the camera,

00:40:07.355 --> 00:40:09.500
determine that yes,
that is Stanislaus.

00:40:09.500 --> 00:40:11.545
He does want to
go into this area.

00:40:11.545 --> 00:40:13.670
And then they would approve
it and let him through.

00:40:17.010 --> 00:40:19.800
Walking through the
corridors of the sarcophagus.

00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:21.960
You can actually see up
here those lead sheets

00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:24.032
I was talking about.

00:40:24.032 --> 00:40:25.740
I don't know how thick
they are on there,

00:40:25.740 --> 00:40:28.110
or how close they are to
falling off, for that matter.

00:40:28.110 --> 00:40:31.170
But I'm sure several
thousand pounds of lead

00:40:31.170 --> 00:40:33.840
is right there alone.

00:40:33.840 --> 00:40:37.440
These are main circulating
pumps, about one-half

00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:43.080
of the main circulating
pumps for reactor 2.

00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:44.700
And each one of
these things takes

00:40:44.700 --> 00:40:47.970
something around, something
around 40 megawatts

00:40:47.970 --> 00:40:50.790
to actually operate.

00:40:50.790 --> 00:40:54.420
These are aligned
differently and are

00:40:54.420 --> 00:40:57.870
of a different type than
the ones used in reactor 4

00:40:57.870 --> 00:41:01.440
because reactors 1 and 2
were of an earlier design.

00:41:01.440 --> 00:41:03.930
Ironically enough,
reactors 1 and 2 actually

00:41:03.930 --> 00:41:05.700
don't have all of
the safety measures

00:41:05.700 --> 00:41:10.050
that reactor 4 does, which is
a bit terrifying to think of.

00:41:12.770 --> 00:41:18.260
Yet more photos, right, as I
said, dog problem at Chernobyl.

00:41:18.260 --> 00:41:20.960
This is right outside the
entrance to a clean facility.

00:41:20.960 --> 00:41:22.910
And occasionally these
dogs would wander in.

00:41:22.910 --> 00:41:27.500
Unfortunately dogs are large
furry piles of easily airborne

00:41:27.500 --> 00:41:28.800
contamination.

00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:30.710
So they would walk in.

00:41:30.710 --> 00:41:32.210
People would go
to shoo them out.

00:41:32.210 --> 00:41:33.980
They would shake their
coats or whatever.

00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:36.440
And then clean up
on aisle three,

00:41:36.440 --> 00:41:41.300
because now there's
contamination everywhere.

00:41:41.300 --> 00:41:44.330
More sad looking puppies.

00:41:44.330 --> 00:41:47.750
New Safe Confinement, yet again,
to give you an idea of scale,

00:41:47.750 --> 00:41:49.355
let's play find the workers.

00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:10.400
Those are workers right there.

00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:11.720
Can you guys see them?

00:42:11.720 --> 00:42:12.980
AUDIENCE: Barely.

00:42:12.980 --> 00:42:17.810
JAKE HECLA: Yeah, they're
really, really small

00:42:17.810 --> 00:42:20.324
next to this facility.

00:42:20.324 --> 00:42:22.280
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:22.280 --> 00:42:27.170
JAKE HECLA: Yeah, I think I've
got a slightly better shot

00:42:27.170 --> 00:42:27.670
here.

00:42:31.390 --> 00:42:33.970
That's a guy right there.

00:42:33.970 --> 00:42:37.550
There's also another
dude right here.

00:42:37.550 --> 00:42:40.300
Yeah, this place is,
or this structure

00:42:40.300 --> 00:42:41.343
is absolutely enormous.

00:42:41.343 --> 00:42:42.760
It's really hard
to wrap your head

00:42:42.760 --> 00:42:45.430
around exactly how large it is.

00:42:45.430 --> 00:42:49.117
So this is in an area
called the local zone.

00:42:49.117 --> 00:42:50.950
So it's the immediate
several hundred meters

00:42:50.950 --> 00:42:52.870
surrounding the reactor.

00:42:52.870 --> 00:42:54.612
As you can see, the
hazmat equipment

00:42:54.612 --> 00:42:56.320
that we're wearing
there is significantly

00:42:56.320 --> 00:42:58.700
different from what we would
wear inside the reactor

00:42:58.700 --> 00:43:00.880
or inside the
sarcophagus, mostly

00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:03.940
because the threat from dust
in this area is pretty huge.

00:43:07.510 --> 00:43:09.190
As you can see, we're
walking on fill.

00:43:09.190 --> 00:43:11.110
It's actually meters
and meters of fill

00:43:11.110 --> 00:43:12.820
because the ground
was so contaminated

00:43:12.820 --> 00:43:15.970
that they scraped it
away, put fill in there,

00:43:15.970 --> 00:43:19.120
put fill on top of that because
just the residual contamination

00:43:19.120 --> 00:43:22.180
was enough to make it hazardous
to use as a work site.

00:43:22.180 --> 00:43:24.820
Though they're not
shown in this image,

00:43:24.820 --> 00:43:29.105
or I believe any
images here, there

00:43:29.105 --> 00:43:31.480
are little concrete
and lead structures

00:43:31.480 --> 00:43:34.270
that these workers
take breaks behind

00:43:34.270 --> 00:43:38.500
because you have a dose
limit that is enforced

00:43:38.500 --> 00:43:39.910
while you're working there.

00:43:39.910 --> 00:43:41.620
And if you're going
to take a smoke

00:43:41.620 --> 00:43:44.110
break, as a huge fraction
of the population of Ukraine

00:43:44.110 --> 00:43:49.522
smokes, or you're going to
take a break of another sort,

00:43:49.522 --> 00:43:51.730
they don't want you racking
up dose during that time.

00:43:51.730 --> 00:43:54.400
So you basically hide in
a little concrete shack

00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:56.200
for a while with a
few inches of lead

00:43:56.200 --> 00:43:59.140
between you and the reactor.

00:43:59.140 --> 00:44:03.940
Yet another shot
inside the sarcophagus,

00:44:03.940 --> 00:44:06.710
Ed explaining something
about which I'm not sure.

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:13.040
As you can see these
places are not exactly

00:44:13.040 --> 00:44:14.930
in the best condition
on the inside.

00:44:14.930 --> 00:44:16.820
And one thing that
did concern me a lot

00:44:16.820 --> 00:44:19.400
was the amount of dust
that was very, very

00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:21.920
easy to kick up in the area.

00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:26.290
This is inside control
room of reactor 4.

00:44:26.290 --> 00:44:29.260
Selfie, which I didn't
mean to have in this album.

00:44:33.460 --> 00:44:37.060
Control room 4 hasn't changed
a whole lot since last year.

00:44:37.060 --> 00:44:40.150
But there is a
dividing wall that

00:44:40.150 --> 00:44:42.520
actually separates
reactors 3 and 4 that's

00:44:42.520 --> 00:44:43.780
being put together.

00:44:43.780 --> 00:44:47.190
And it cuts right through the
edge of the fourth control

00:44:47.190 --> 00:44:47.690
room.

00:44:47.690 --> 00:44:50.685
And for a while, we actually
didn't know whether or not

00:44:50.685 --> 00:44:52.810
we were going to be able
to visit it at all because

00:44:52.810 --> 00:44:53.920
of ongoing construction.

00:44:53.920 --> 00:44:57.640
I'm very glad that
we were able to.

00:44:57.640 --> 00:45:00.280
Most of the instruments
have been removed.

00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:02.590
It's unclear as to why.

00:45:02.590 --> 00:45:05.350
We've been told that some of it
was because of contamination.

00:45:05.350 --> 00:45:09.160
But the pattern doesn't
really make sense.

00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:15.320
This is the reactor control
room cartogram, excuse me,

00:45:15.320 --> 00:45:17.480
reactor core cartogram,
which, as I said

00:45:17.480 --> 00:45:21.020
was lit and could display
various parameters regarding

00:45:21.020 --> 00:45:24.420
the various fuel channels.

00:45:24.420 --> 00:45:30.080
There is only two control
rod indicator, well, yeah.

00:45:30.080 --> 00:45:34.870
There are really only these
control rod indicators left.

00:45:34.870 --> 00:45:36.620
And we believe that
actually some of these

00:45:36.620 --> 00:45:37.580
might not be original.

00:45:37.580 --> 00:45:39.163
Someone might have
stolen the real one

00:45:39.163 --> 00:45:42.493
and put another one back.

00:45:42.493 --> 00:45:44.160
I don't have any
evidence to support it.

00:45:44.160 --> 00:45:45.980
But I suspect that there's
significant looting that

00:45:45.980 --> 00:45:46.647
happens in here.

00:45:51.970 --> 00:45:54.370
This is a rather
entertaining photo.

00:45:54.370 --> 00:45:57.760
That means smoking area.

00:45:57.760 --> 00:45:59.048
That's in the control room.

00:45:59.048 --> 00:46:00.090
You shouldn't be smoking.

00:46:00.090 --> 00:46:02.290
You shouldn't take your
mask off for any reason.

00:46:08.470 --> 00:46:11.010
That's a high gamma
radiation warning sign.

00:46:11.010 --> 00:46:13.140
It was in fact, not that
high of a dose rate,

00:46:13.140 --> 00:46:14.880
somewhere in the range
of 30 mR an hour.

00:46:18.900 --> 00:46:24.930
We also explored a little bit
outside of the more formal part

00:46:24.930 --> 00:46:28.530
of the reactor
premises, namely we

00:46:28.530 --> 00:46:31.410
went to this place called
Buriakivka 2, which

00:46:31.410 --> 00:46:37.020
is a burial facility for
waste from the reactor,

00:46:37.020 --> 00:46:40.590
not waste as in nuclear waste
but waste is in chunks of metal

00:46:40.590 --> 00:46:42.900
and other things that are
contaminated and therefore

00:46:42.900 --> 00:46:45.900
removed when the New Safe
Confinement Arch was being

00:46:45.900 --> 00:46:49.950
built, or when, let's say, they
were building the separation

00:46:49.950 --> 00:46:52.232
wall between reactors 3 and 4.

00:46:52.232 --> 00:46:53.940
And there were some
incredibly hot spots.

00:46:53.940 --> 00:46:58.950
So I might, I think I have
some more photos later.

00:46:58.950 --> 00:47:02.340
But just under that
little triangle,

00:47:02.340 --> 00:47:08.850
the dose rate was 150 mR an
hour, so 0.15 rem an hour.

00:47:08.850 --> 00:47:10.420
It's extremely high.

00:47:10.420 --> 00:47:16.830
And that was just in a field
basically, not controlled, not

00:47:16.830 --> 00:47:19.180
patrolled, no warning signs.

00:47:21.840 --> 00:47:25.570
Getting dressed up, lots of fun.

00:47:25.570 --> 00:47:29.547
That was the truck we were
sent to decontaminate.

00:47:29.547 --> 00:47:31.380
Honestly it wasn't
particularly contaminated

00:47:31.380 --> 00:47:32.172
in the first place.

00:47:32.172 --> 00:47:35.870
They weren't going to give us
real fun things to play with.

00:47:35.870 --> 00:47:36.790
That's all of us.

00:47:36.790 --> 00:47:39.100
And then as you notice,
the real workers

00:47:39.100 --> 00:47:42.580
here are not wearing even
a fraction of what we are.

00:47:47.220 --> 00:47:56.450
More decontamination,
yeah, see, barely anything.

00:47:56.450 --> 00:47:58.950
These are chunks of metal that
have come out of the reactor.

00:47:58.950 --> 00:48:03.270
We're not exactly sure what
part, what parts they are.

00:48:03.270 --> 00:48:06.300
No one was really able to
answer our questions about them.

00:48:06.300 --> 00:48:08.430
But they were also
rather contaminated,

00:48:08.430 --> 00:48:10.740
somewhere in the
range of 50 to 75 mR

00:48:10.740 --> 00:48:15.160
an hour on contact
in some spots.

00:48:15.160 --> 00:48:18.952
More photos of Chernobyl, or
of Chernobyl from Pripyat.

00:48:18.952 --> 00:48:21.160
MICHAEL SHORT: Dr. Jake, I
want to take a quick break

00:48:21.160 --> 00:48:24.610
and ask folks if they
have any questions on what

00:48:24.610 --> 00:48:26.584
the experience was
like [INAUDIBLE]..

00:48:31.823 --> 00:48:32.490
JAKE HECLA: Yes?

00:48:32.490 --> 00:48:34.282
AUDIENCE: Did you suffer
any adverse health

00:48:34.282 --> 00:48:35.620
effects or anything?

00:48:35.620 --> 00:48:39.880
JAKE HECLA: Only the cold I
picked up on the way back.

00:48:39.880 --> 00:48:43.450
The total dose that I received
on this entire expedition,

00:48:43.450 --> 00:48:47.840
minus the flights there and
back, was 0.6 millisieverts.

00:48:47.840 --> 00:48:52.090
So effectively, nothing.

00:48:52.090 --> 00:48:53.710
MICHAEL SHORT: [INAUDIBLE].

00:48:53.710 --> 00:48:57.190
JAKE HECLA: Well, all of
the high radiation areas

00:48:57.190 --> 00:49:01.160
that we were in, we were
encouraged to walk quickly,

00:49:01.160 --> 00:49:03.880
is basically what
it comes down to.

00:49:03.880 --> 00:49:05.980
The time portion of time,
distance, and shielding

00:49:05.980 --> 00:49:09.300
was emphasized.

00:49:09.300 --> 00:49:11.010
Further questions?

00:49:11.010 --> 00:49:12.112
Yeah.

00:49:12.112 --> 00:49:15.290
AUDIENCE: Are there [INAUDIBLE]
radiation area versus

00:49:15.290 --> 00:49:16.232
[INAUDIBLE].

00:49:16.232 --> 00:49:17.940
Do they use the same
levels [INAUDIBLE]??

00:49:17.940 --> 00:49:21.570
JAKE HECLA: No, radiological
control in Ukraine

00:49:21.570 --> 00:49:25.950
is a totally different
game than it is in the US.

00:49:25.950 --> 00:49:29.190
There are the same
types of controls

00:49:29.190 --> 00:49:34.650
that exist in the US just
don't exist at that site.

00:49:34.650 --> 00:49:38.850
For areas that are immediately
dangerous to your health,

00:49:38.850 --> 00:49:41.250
you know, 10 rad
an hour, something

00:49:41.250 --> 00:49:44.130
like that, from what I
understand that there

00:49:44.130 --> 00:49:47.850
are locked doors that prevent
one from accessing those

00:49:47.850 --> 00:49:48.930
accidentally.

00:49:48.930 --> 00:49:51.250
And there are warning signs
in a variety of locations.

00:49:51.250 --> 00:49:55.560
But I don't think that there
is a the same standardization

00:49:55.560 --> 00:50:01.726
of 5 mR an hours is a radiation
area, et cetera, et cetera.

00:50:01.726 --> 00:50:02.226
Yeah.

00:50:05.530 --> 00:50:06.573
Further?

00:50:06.573 --> 00:50:08.240
MICHAEL SHORT: And
are folks still going

00:50:08.240 --> 00:50:10.200
to be running these tours
pretty continuously?

00:50:10.200 --> 00:50:10.940
JAKE HECLA: No.

00:50:10.940 --> 00:50:14.240
You won't be able to see the
sarcophagus itself because it

00:50:14.240 --> 00:50:17.870
will be contained within the
New Safe Confinement Arch

00:50:17.870 --> 00:50:19.890
pretty much now.

00:50:19.890 --> 00:50:22.550
It's 75, right, let's see.

00:50:22.550 --> 00:50:24.470
Last I checked, the New
Safe Confinement Arch

00:50:24.470 --> 00:50:29.660
was 75 percent of the way
over the reactor itself.

00:50:29.660 --> 00:50:32.030
Regular tourist
visits to Pripyat

00:50:32.030 --> 00:50:34.850
will continue to happen.

00:50:34.850 --> 00:50:37.640
This program that I went on
is something very special.

00:50:40.370 --> 00:50:45.800
Carl, Ed, and Erik have done
this type of thing once before.

00:50:45.800 --> 00:50:47.910
That was the trip I
went on last year.

00:50:47.910 --> 00:50:53.417
And they intend on doing it
once a year as long as they can.

00:50:53.417 --> 00:50:55.250
But that's pretty much
your only opportunity

00:50:55.250 --> 00:50:57.440
to get that kind of
access to the reactor.

00:50:57.440 --> 00:50:58.550
It takes a lot of work.

00:51:02.840 --> 00:51:05.280
MICHAEL SHORT: Anyone else
have questions for Jake?

00:51:05.280 --> 00:51:08.520
It's rare to meet someone that's
actually gone to Chernobyl to

00:51:08.520 --> 00:51:09.040
[INAUDIBLE].

00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:10.090
Yeah?

00:51:10.090 --> 00:51:11.970
AUDIENCE: Do you
think it's haunted?

00:51:11.970 --> 00:51:14.500
JAKE HECLA: No.

00:51:14.500 --> 00:51:17.080
There's a rather haunting
location, though,

00:51:17.080 --> 00:51:19.480
the Khodemchuk Memorial.

00:51:19.480 --> 00:51:22.750
So when the accident happened
there was one guy who was--

00:51:22.750 --> 00:51:26.080
depending on how you look at
it, either lucky or unlucky--

00:51:26.080 --> 00:51:28.390
in that he wasn't killed
by radiation poisoning.

00:51:28.390 --> 00:51:32.770
He was killed by being
flattened in the explosion.

00:51:32.770 --> 00:51:35.650
And his remains are
within the reactor

00:51:35.650 --> 00:51:39.162
and within the sarcophagus,
never really recovered him.

00:51:39.162 --> 00:51:40.870
Better than dying of
radiation poisoning.

00:51:40.870 --> 00:51:44.800
But nonetheless, not
a fantastic way to go.

00:51:44.800 --> 00:51:48.220
The memorial that is
within the sarcophagus

00:51:48.220 --> 00:51:53.770
is pretty interesting to
visit, and rather somber.

00:51:53.770 --> 00:51:56.920
Makes you reflect a little
bit on the enormous human toll

00:51:56.920 --> 00:51:59.220
that the accident had.

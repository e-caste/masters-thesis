00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.180
PROFESSOR: Here is
the answer, answer.

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:11.740
It's easier apparently to
write 1 over T. And 1 over T

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:24.070
is equal to 1 plus 1 over 4 V0
squared over E times E plus V0

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.420
times sine squared of 2k2a.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.460
So the one thing to
notice in this formula,

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:44.590
it's a little complicated,
is that the second term

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:45.580
is positive.

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.720
Because V0 squared is positive,
the energy is positive,

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.460
and sine squared is positive.

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.260
So if this is positive,
the right-hand side

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.690
is greater than 1.

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:06.460
And therefore, the
T is less than 1.

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:13.970
So this implies T less
than or equal to 1.

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.590
And there seems to
be a possibility

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:27.770
of T being equal to 1
exactly if the sine squared

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.150
of this quantity, or the sine
of this quantity, vanishes.

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:35.750
So there is a possibility of
very interesting saturation,

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.850
in which the transmission
is really equal to 1.

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.100
So we'll see it.

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:50.070
The other thing you can notice
is that, as E goes to 0,

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.410
this is infinite.

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:55.985
And therefore, T is going to 0.

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.740
No transmission as
the energy goes to 0.

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:15.970
As the energy goes to infinity,
well, this term goes to 0.

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.790
And you get transmission,
T equals to one.

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.215
So these are interesting limits.

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:28.510
Now, to appreciate
this better, we

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:36.890
can write it with
unit-free language.

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:42.070
So for that, I'll
do the following.

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:45.840
It's a little rewriting,
but it helps a bit.

00:02:49.970 --> 00:03:01.600
So think of 2k2
times a, this factor,

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.970
as the argument of
the sine function.

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.290
Well, it's 2.

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:18.580
k2 was defined up there, so it's
2m a squared E plus V0 over h

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.460
squared.

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:27.020
And I put the a inside
the square root.

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:29.150
So what do we have here?

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:35.800
2 times the square
root of 2m a squared.

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:42.170
Let's factor a V0, so that
you have 1 plus E over V0.

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.310
And you have h squared here.

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:53.940
So this is OK.

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.730
There's clearly two
things you can do.

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:02.260
First, define a
unit-free energy.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.430
So the energy is now
described by this little E.

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:12.330
Without units, that compares
the energy of your energy

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:15.500
eigenstate to the
depth of the potential.

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.029
So it should be over V0.

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.590
So this is nice.

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:27.760
You don't have to talk
about EVs or some quantity.

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.350
Just a pure number.

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:34.680
And here, there is another
number that is famous.

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:38.970
This is the number Z0
squared of a potential well.

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:43.800
This is the unit-free
number that tells you

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.010
how deep or profound
is your potential,

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:49.650
and controls the
number of zeros.

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:56.930
So at this moment,
this is simply 2 Z0,

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:00.370
because the square root is there
and takes the Z0 squared out

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:01.340
as Z0.

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:09.960
Square root of 1 plus
e, which is nice.

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:17.700
So here, you can divide
by V0 squared, numerator

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:18.850
and denominator.

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:24.000
So you have an E over V0,
and a 1 plus an E over V0.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:33.330
So the end result is that 1
over T is now 1 plus 1 over 4e 1

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:42.360
plus e sine squared of 2
Z0 square root of 1 plus e.

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:57.880
So it's ready for
numerical calculation,

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:03.720
for plotting, and doing all
kinds of things with it.

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:07.430
But what we want to
understand is this phenomenon

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:13.190
that you would expect, in
general, some reflection

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:15.200
and some transmission.

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:18.380
But there is a possibility
when T is equal

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:24.560
to 1, and in particular, when
this sine squared function

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:29.030
is equal to 0, and that
will make T equal to 1,

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:32.870
then you have a
perfect transmission.

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:35.990
So let's see why
it is happening,

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:38.420
or under what
circumstances it happens.

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:47.680
So for what the
energies will we have?

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:50.820
For what energies?

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:58.861
Energies is T equal to 1.

00:06:58.861 --> 00:07:00.940
It's perfect transmission.

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:03.610
No reflection whatsoever.

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:11.050
So we need, then, that the
argument of this sine function

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:18.870
be equal to multiples of pi,
2 Z0 square root of 1 plus e

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:21.880
is equal to a multiple of pi.

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:31.020
Now, we would say what
the multiple of pi?

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:35.500
Well, it could be 0, 1, 2, 3.

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:41.180
Not obvious, because the only
thing you have here to adjust

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:43.880
is the energy.

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:45.610
The energy is positive.

00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:49.170
And that's that
little e in here.

00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:56.250
So this number n must
exceed some number,

00:07:56.250 --> 00:08:00.165
because this left-hand side
never becomes very small.

00:08:00.165 --> 00:08:03.510
The smallest it can be is 2 Z0.

00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:12.415
So n must be greater than
or equal to 2 Z0 over pi.

00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:24.775
This is because e, since
e is greater than 0.

00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:34.850
So the left hand
side is a number

00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:37.669
that is greater than 2 Z0,
and the right-hand side

00:08:37.669 --> 00:08:39.740
must therefore be that way.

00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:47.210
All right, so this
is a possibility.

00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:51.300
But then, let's calculate
those values of the energies.

00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:55.605
Calculate those en's.

00:08:58.790 --> 00:09:00.050
So what do we have?

00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:03.350
We squared the left
hand side for Z0

00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:11.305
squared times and 1 plus en is
equal to pi squared n squared.

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:33.250
And en is equal to minus
1 plus n squared pi

00:09:33.250 --> 00:09:36.000
squared over 4 Z0 squared.

00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:46.800
OK, this is quantitatively nice.

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:51.000
But probably still doesn't
give us much intuition about

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.300
what's going on.

00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:57.480
So let me go back
to the total energy.

00:09:57.480 --> 00:10:01.680
en, remember, was
energy divided by V0.

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:08.040
So multiply all terms by V0.

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:19.248
E equals minus V0 plus n
squared pi squared V0 over 4.

00:10:19.248 --> 00:10:22.260
Z0 squared, I'm going
to go all the way back

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.240
to conventional language.

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:32.010
And, too, 4 times Z0
squared, which is 2ma

00:10:32.010 --> 00:10:37.485
squared V0 over h bar squared.

00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:54.600
So E is minus V0 plus
n squared pi squared.

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:57.360
The V0s cancel.

00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:03.510
h squared over 2n
times 2a squared.

00:11:09.090 --> 00:11:10.740
I think I got every term right.

00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:17.810
So what does this say?

00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:25.340
Well, think of the potential.

00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:29.780
In this region,
there's an e here.

00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:33.910
And there's minus V0 there.

00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:39.390
So it says E is minus
V0 plus this quantity.

00:11:39.390 --> 00:11:47.670
So minus V0 plus this
quantity, which is n

00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:54.260
squared pi squared h squared
over 2m times 2a squared.

00:11:57.260 --> 00:12:03.320
So the resonance
happens if the energy

00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:08.390
is a distance above the
bottom of the potential, which

00:12:08.390 --> 00:12:10.745
is equal to this quantity.

00:12:13.950 --> 00:12:16.560
And now, you see
something that we could

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:19.300
have seen maybe some other way.

00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:24.810
That what's happening here is a
little strange at first sight.

00:12:24.810 --> 00:12:31.170
These are the energy levels
of an infinite square

00:12:31.170 --> 00:12:35.345
well of width, 2a.

00:12:35.345 --> 00:12:39.120
If you remember, the energy
levels of an infinite square

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:43.110
well are n squared
pi squared h squared

00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:46.740
over 2m times the width squared.

00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:49.590
And those are exactly it.

00:12:49.590 --> 00:12:55.860
So the energies at which
you find the transmission,

00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:59.880
and the name is going to
become obvious in a second,

00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:02.600
it's called the
resonant transition,

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:09.840
are those in which
the energy coincides

00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:15.090
with some hypothetical
energy of the infinite square

00:13:15.090 --> 00:13:17.506
well that you would put here.

00:13:17.506 --> 00:13:20.850
If it is as if you would have
put an infinite square well

00:13:20.850 --> 00:13:23.820
in the middle and
look at where are

00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:31.052
the energies of bound states
that are bigger than 0,

00:13:31.052 --> 00:13:32.760
that might be bouncing
the energies here,

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:35.310
but those are not
relevant, because you only

00:13:35.310 --> 00:13:37.300
consider energies positive.

00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:40.140
So if you find an
energy that is positive,

00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:47.351
that corresponds to a would-be
of infinite square well, that's

00:13:47.351 --> 00:13:47.850
it.

00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:52.800
That's an energy for which
you will have transmission.

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:58.040
And in fact, if we
think about this

00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:06.210
from the viewpoint
of the wave function,

00:14:06.210 --> 00:14:14.280
this factor over here, look
at this property over here.

00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:16.610
So what do we have?

00:14:16.610 --> 00:14:25.520
The condition was
that k2 time 2a,

00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:28.160
the argument of
the sine function

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:34.000
would be a multiple of pi.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:42.460
But k2 is 2 pi over the
wavelength of the wave

00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:45.850
that you have in
this range, over 2a.

00:14:45.850 --> 00:14:48.970
It's equal to n pi.

00:14:48.970 --> 00:14:51.565
So we can cancel
the pis and the 2s

00:14:51.565 --> 00:15:00.930
so that you get 2a over
lambda is equal to n over 2.

00:15:06.050 --> 00:15:08.560
And what does that say?

00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:12.960
It says that the de
Broglie wavelength

00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:21.170
that you have in this region
is such that it fits into 2a.

00:15:26.096 --> 00:15:28.590
Let me write it
yet in another way.

00:15:28.590 --> 00:15:30.070
Let me try this a as--

00:15:33.846 --> 00:15:37.610
I won't write it like that.

00:15:37.610 --> 00:15:38.670
Leave it like that.

00:15:38.670 --> 00:15:45.050
The wavelength lambda fits
into 2a a half-integer number

00:15:45.050 --> 00:15:47.400
of times.

00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:52.060
And that's exactly what you
have in an infinite square well.

00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:56.500
If you have a width, well, you
could have half a wavelength

00:15:56.500 --> 00:16:02.950
there for n equals 1, a
full thing for n equals 2,

00:16:02.950 --> 00:16:05.380
3 halves for n equals 3.

00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:09.820
You always get half and
halves and halves increasing

00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:11.530
and increasing all the time.

00:16:16.970 --> 00:16:17.470
Yeah.

00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:23.105
So the way I think
I wanted to do it,

00:16:23.105 --> 00:16:27.060
this equation can
be written as n is

00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:32.469
equal to 2a over lambda over 2.

00:16:32.469 --> 00:16:33.510
That's the same equation.

00:16:36.070 --> 00:16:40.090
So in this way, you see an
integer a number of times

00:16:40.090 --> 00:16:45.690
is 2a divided by lambda
over 2, which is precisely

00:16:45.690 --> 00:16:51.340
the condition for infinite
square well energy eigenstate.

00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:55.590
So there is no infinite square
well anywhere in this problem.

00:16:55.590 --> 00:17:01.080
But somehow, when the
wavelength of the de Broglie

00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:05.069
representation of the
particle in this region

00:17:05.069 --> 00:17:10.440
is an exact number of
half-waves, there's resonance.

00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:13.710
And this resonance is
such that it allows a wave

00:17:13.710 --> 00:17:16.369
to go completely through.

00:17:16.369 --> 00:17:19.890
It's a pretty
remarkable phenomenon.

00:17:19.890 --> 00:17:25.690
So the infinite
square well appears

00:17:25.690 --> 00:17:30.280
just as a way to think of what
are the energies at which you

00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:32.590
will observe the resonances.

00:17:32.590 --> 00:17:37.930
But the resonance is simply
due to having an exact number

00:17:37.930 --> 00:17:43.040
of half-waves in this region.

00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:47.380
So we can do on a
little numerical example

00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:50.010
to show how that works.

00:00:20.062 --> 00:00:21.520
PROFESSOR STRANG:
So I'm hoping you

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.560
will ask some questions today.

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.940
So we've had the exam.

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:31.320
If you have any questions
about grading the two TAs

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.320
are the people to speak to.

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.540
Ramis graded Questions
one and two, and Peter

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:38.820
graded three and four.

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.980
And they control things.

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.570
I mean, I can help if
there's an emergency,

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.370
but they would be the
right people to speak to.

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.440
Because they know how they
graded the whole test.

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:57.970
Before you ask questions, can
I just say why this truss --

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:02.450
you remember this
six-sided truss --

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:09.070
tied me in a knot and I'm hoping
your MATLAB solution will untie

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:11.010
that knot.

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.380
The knot I was in was to
find the mechanisms, to find

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.490
convenient mechanisms
because we have,

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.960
well, I thought we had six bars.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.510
It looks like we have six bars.

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:28.640
But somebody pointed
out after class

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.350
that that bar six
is not very active.

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.940
It's connecting two
supports, can't do anything,

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:42.550
and actually that sixth
row of the A matrix

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:44.570
will be all zeroes.

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.540
So our matrix, if we include
that, there was no use,

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.250
it doesn't help.

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.230
So our matrix then really
comes from the five bars,

00:01:55.230 --> 00:02:03.030
so A is then five by, two
unknowns, two, two, two,

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.370
making altogether
eight unknowns.

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:12.120
So three mechanisms and
that's what I'm hoping for.

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.480
So when I unwisely drew
that picture on the board

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.200
at the end of the truss
lecture, I was only

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.100
looking for two
mechanisms because I

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.140
was thinking we had
six edges, six bars,

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:31.260
but really this bar,
when I knock out

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:37.000
the columns that correspond
to that node and that node,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.230
there will only be
zeroes left in that row.

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.310
And it's nothing.

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:47.880
It correctly tells us that the
stretching of that bar is zero

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.990
but we knew that anyway.

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:57.510
OK, I don't know if you've
tackled the MATLAB question,

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:03.620
and I also don't know whether
MATLAB would produce for us--

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.240
I mean, you should
be able to construct

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:09.650
A with a whole lot of
square roots of three

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:16.290
over two from sine of 60
degrees and maybe 1/2's

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.890
from sine of 30 degrees.

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:25.250
A should look pretty nice, but
what the solutions to these

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:30.000
mechanisms are, of
course solutions to Au=0,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:39.350
and-- Anyway, I'm hoping that
we learn from this example.

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:42.490
I hadn't intended-- So
it's pretty small MATLAB,

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:45.900
it's really just the
creation of the matrix A.

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.500
OK, so that was a
comment on that,

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.190
which I added to the homework.

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:57.340
Now, I'm ready for questions
about the homework, the exam

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.070
whatever, yes thank you.

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:01.430
Oh, good.

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:06.570
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:09.596
PROFESSOR STRANG:
For trusses, OK.

00:04:09.596 --> 00:04:10.470
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:14.250
PROFESSOR STRANG: Yeah.

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.600
A^T A immediately, couldn't you?

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.780
It's not quite so
straightforward.

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:21.650
And this is like more realistic.

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:25.080
I mean, yeah.

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.080
Ah.

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.630
I guess, yeah, but remind
me what that question was.

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:37.170
This was a 2.7 problem one?

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:40.050
OK, let me just see
what I'm asking for.

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:43.020
So, OK, yes.

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.540
So I only asked
about A transpose A,

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:49.750
I only asked you for the
shape in that question.

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:55.820
Oh, and then I asked you for
the first row, good for me, yes.

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:58.985
I see, the first row
so I didn't put you

00:04:58.985 --> 00:05:03.210
to the agony of writing
out the whole thing,

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:09.550
but still how do you get the
first row, good question.

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:12.334
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:12.334 --> 00:05:13.500
PROFESSOR STRANG: Oh, I see.

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:15.790
Now, well it's not
going to be so neat.

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:17.320
Let's just think.

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:23.090
We could do the first row of
A, and the first column of A

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:26.750
probably, yeah.

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:30.800
So what am I looking
for in A transpose A,

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:34.140
because it didn't say row one.

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:41.710
OK, so row one of A transpose A
corresponds to the first-- Oh,

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:42.800
so what is row one?

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.380
Yeah, this is worth
thinking about.

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:49.850
So this is A transpose
A for trusses.

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:51.830
And let's just,
maybe we could even

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:54.830
take this one as an example.

00:05:54.830 --> 00:06:01.330
If I number the nodes, if that's
my first node, A transpose A,

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:03.460
you remember that's square.

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:07.960
That tells us the edge part,
the bar part is built into it.

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:13.540
But its size is n by n, its
size is five by, no, its size

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:15.740
is what, eight by eight, right?

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:21.670
It's got to do with
the number of-- OK.

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:29.830
So its first row, what will
its first row be about?

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:36.920
It'll be about u H 1, right?

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:41.050
The first row of
this A transpose

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:46.260
A matrix will be about, the
first node but more than that,

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:50.690
that node has got two
things, u H and u V,

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:52.160
and we're putting H first.

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:59.140
So so I think that the first
row of this, let's just draw it.

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:00.660
Maybe I'm not saying--

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:05.860
So let that be A
transpose A, I see, yeah.

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:12.820
A transpose A will be
multiplying u H 1, u V 1,

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:13.991
and so forth.

00:07:13.991 --> 00:07:14.490
Right?

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:15.950
OK, good.

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:17.800
So now this is better.

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:22.260
All I'm asking is
where do we know

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:26.040
there are zeroes in that
first row of A transpose A?

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:30.480
Where would we know that there
are zeroes for this problem

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:33.210
rather than-- I won't
redraw the one in the book

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:35.260
so I'm taking this truss.

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:38.600
So if it's this truss,
this is the first node,

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:44.130
the bars are numbered like
this, and of course your MATLAB

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:47.630
construction of A, you might
multiply out A transpose A.

00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:49.700
Because in MATLAB that
would be so quick.

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:51.780
And you could see
what it looks like.

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:57.980
And where would we expect
to see zeroes or not zeroes?

00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:04.580
Let's see, A transpose
A, so I'll have to think.

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:09.780
My instinct is that it should
only connect two neighbors.

00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:12.750
So that I would
imagine, but I've

00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:14.490
got-- These are
double neighbors,

00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:17.670
right, there's two
people living here.

00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:19.290
We have to remember.

00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:22.370
So I see two people living
here and two people at home,

00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:26.920
so I guess I would imagine four
non-zeroes for this problem

00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:30.770
in in the first row.

00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:37.820
I would think that that would
have somebody on the diagonal.

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:41.450
That would be what
multiplies u H 1 itself,

00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:45.970
and then maybe u V 1 is
involved, and these two guys.

00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:49.750
These two and those two
would not be involved.

00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:52.100
Well, that's only
a partial answer,

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:55.970
I'm just telling you where
the zeroes are, I think.

00:08:55.970 --> 00:09:01.110
And you're really asking about
the non-zeroes, of course.

00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:03.680
So, yeah.

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:06.990
Not so easy.

00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:07.490
Yeah --

00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:07.750
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:09.458
PROFESSOR STRANG: --
maybe have to do it.

00:09:09.458 --> 00:09:13.340
OK, yeah.

00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:18.140
I think, the first time
better to do it, yeah.

00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:19.900
But that's an
excellent question,

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:25.250
and maybe we will find a
nice, and if somebody does,

00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:26.190
let me know.

00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:29.210
A nice way to see that.

00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:31.450
Somehow I must have
felt that was doable

00:09:31.450 --> 00:09:37.590
when I created that problem.

00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:40.120
OK.

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:44.520
The other thing to say
though, that while I'm

00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:47.090
looking at A transpose
A, is remember

00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:53.710
that it can be created by
these element matrices.

00:09:53.710 --> 00:09:56.530
Yeah, yeah, that's
important to say.

00:09:56.530 --> 00:10:02.230
So there will be five
element matrices, right?

00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:04.460
Because I've got five bars.

00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:07.810
And the element matrix
for this bar, or say

00:10:07.810 --> 00:10:12.310
for a typical bar, the
element matrix for this bar

00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:16.230
will involve all the u's that
are connected to this bar.

00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:18.550
So two u's there
and two u's there,

00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:22.130
so it'll be four by four,
the element matrix here.

00:10:22.130 --> 00:10:30.230
So this will contribute four
non-zeroes to that to row

00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:31.470
and to three other rows.

00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:35.750
That four by four guy
from this part is,

00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:37.640
you know what I'm
speaking about here?

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:41.370
The element matrix which is
just-- The element matrix

00:10:41.370 --> 00:10:47.950
is a cosine, sine, minus
cosine and minus sine.

00:10:47.950 --> 00:10:49.780
Column times row.

00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:54.440
Cosine, sine, minus
cosine, minus sine.

00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:57.450
This is the element
matrix for this bar,

00:10:57.450 --> 00:11:00.750
those are the cosine
and sine of 60 degrees,

00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:10.450
and those positions would
be these two and these two.

00:11:10.450 --> 00:11:14.640
So there would be actually four
zeroes coming after, and after

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:18.360
here from those
two and those two.

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:23.570
So this bar contributes
to A transpose A,

00:11:23.570 --> 00:11:26.620
sort of stamps
into A transpose A.

00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:33.190
This four by four of non-zeroes
plus the rest zeroes, stamps

00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:36.690
that in up there.

00:11:36.690 --> 00:11:43.530
This guy has its
own element matrix.

00:11:43.530 --> 00:11:47.470
Now, what's different about the
element matrix for this guy?

00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:52.300
Of course it's got its own c_1,
probably, and it had a c_2,

00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:53.480
this difference constant.

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:56.250
But bigger
differences than that.

00:11:56.250 --> 00:11:59.000
First of all, it's a
different angle, theta.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:05.540
Here the angle is 120
degrees, and also there's

00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:08.000
nobody home down there.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.440
So it would be, if we
were dealing with A_0,

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:15.220
free-free stuff, it
would be four by four,

00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:16.550
like all the others.

00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:23.080
But because these two are
fixed, those two displacements

00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:28.530
are fixed, effectively it will
only contribute two by two.

00:12:28.530 --> 00:12:30.250
A total of four non-zeroes.

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:33.090
But those will stamp
into A transpose

00:12:33.090 --> 00:12:37.270
A overlapping this guy.

00:12:37.270 --> 00:12:40.030
Then the ones from
these bars will not

00:12:40.030 --> 00:12:43.160
touch the first row
of A transpose A,

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:44.730
so they wouldn't
touch the answer

00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:47.810
to that homework problem.

00:12:47.810 --> 00:12:52.510
So you see again another way.

00:12:52.510 --> 00:12:57.210
By hand, I don't know
that you necessarily

00:12:57.210 --> 00:13:01.610
want to use these element
matrices, I'm not sure.

00:13:01.610 --> 00:13:03.720
But it gives an excellent check.

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:06.320
So one way to
create A transpose A

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:11.520
is create a-- Multiply,
that's one way.

00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:16.450
Second way is, create A
transpose A element by--

00:13:16.450 --> 00:13:23.310
By these five element matrices
popped into the right places.

00:13:23.310 --> 00:13:26.670
I think this is, so this like
the computational science

00:13:26.670 --> 00:13:31.430
part of the course.

00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:33.580
It's the way you
would, I'm really

00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:36.310
speaking about the way you
would write the code, not

00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:40.090
the final result. So,
much of the course

00:13:40.090 --> 00:13:44.200
has been devoted to
understanding A transpose A,

00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:46.900
and the fact that it's
positive definite,

00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:50.990
or in this case only positive
semi-definite because we

00:13:50.990 --> 00:13:53.560
have an eight by eight
matrix whose rank is only

00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:55.440
going to be five.

00:13:55.440 --> 00:14:01.960
So this matrix will have
these same mechanisms,

00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:06.420
and I'm hoping to
learn what they are.

00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:08.700
Well I hope that's a little
help with that question.

00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:11.600
But basically,
though, it's non-help

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:14.200
because I'm sort of
saying you're on your own

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:20.000
to actually-- I don't have
a superfragilistic way

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:25.550
to construct a matrix and then
you kind of have to do it.

00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:28.860
But I'm glad you asked.

00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:29.850
Yes?

00:14:29.850 --> 00:14:32.460
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:35.770
PROFESSOR STRANG: More
on this problem, OK.

00:14:35.770 --> 00:14:39.795
The sign convention.

00:14:39.795 --> 00:14:40.670
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:41.586
PROFESSOR STRANG: Yes.

00:14:41.586 --> 00:14:43.270
So let's see.

00:14:43.270 --> 00:14:46.310
So I made a speech about
sign conventions, right?

00:14:49.050 --> 00:14:54.290
Which was that I am
too old for them.

00:14:54.290 --> 00:14:57.310
And the justification
for that is the fact

00:14:57.310 --> 00:15:01.010
that they wash out
in A transpose.

00:15:01.010 --> 00:15:04.630
So if you were to use the
wrong sign convention in A,

00:15:04.630 --> 00:15:06.360
you won't see it
in A transpose A.

00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:09.140
So if I change the whole thing.

00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:15.420
So sign convention is
not really a convention.

00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:22.590
Our convention is to decide that
that movement that way is plus.

00:15:22.590 --> 00:15:25.290
And movement this way is plus.

00:15:25.290 --> 00:15:26.550
And here, similarly.

00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:30.220
That's a plus movement and
that's a plus movement.

00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:32.620
That's our sign convention.

00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:38.250
If we always do that,
then the A matrix

00:15:38.250 --> 00:15:42.390
is telling us how much
this bar stretches.

00:15:42.390 --> 00:15:45.480
It's the matrix that gives
us stretching from these four

00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:46.840
displacements.

00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:54.500
And then, these, I
think in this picture,

00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:58.510
if this is the later node
and this is the thing,

00:15:58.510 --> 00:16:01.860
then that angle
from the horizontal

00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:03.540
is the right guy to put there.

00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:05.902
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:16:05.902 --> 00:16:06.860
PROFESSOR STRANG: Here?

00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:12.630
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:16:12.630 --> 00:16:18.130
PROFESSOR STRANG: Well,
I guess I'm, I see,

00:16:18.130 --> 00:16:20.360
the question is what's
the sign convention

00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:22.200
with this particular picture?

00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:27.280
Yeah, if this is node
one and that's two,

00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:31.340
then-- Your question is good.

00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:35.970
It looks, I think, so I
think I've got it not right.

00:16:35.970 --> 00:16:40.890
If this is node one down
below, and two up above,

00:16:40.890 --> 00:16:46.690
then moving two positively
would stretch the bar.

00:16:46.690 --> 00:16:48.580
And I've got minuses there.

00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:53.200
So I've got the opposite signs.

00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:57.450
I've got there, the signs that
would go with this numbering.

00:16:57.450 --> 00:17:00.120
If that was node two
and this was node one.

00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:03.440
Yeah, you're right, good.

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:05.440
You have to, and that's
the only way I do it,

00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:10.260
is to think will the
movement stretch the bar?

00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:13.620
Then that's got a
positive entry in A. Will

00:17:13.620 --> 00:17:18.040
the movement like that
compress the bar, that'll

00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:19.410
be a negative entry.

00:17:19.410 --> 00:17:25.900
And our conventions are if
it stretches that's positive.

00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:32.180
e positive means a stretching;
e negative means a compression.

00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:35.480
So it takes a little patience.

00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:38.590
Or it takes writing
the code correctly once

00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:46.140
and then of course it would
do it for all these problems.

00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:48.910
Yeah, I think the TA
in an earlier year

00:17:48.910 --> 00:17:52.960
actually wrote a code
to, a truss code.

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:59.010
I don't know what happened
to it but I could look.

00:17:59.010 --> 00:18:01.310
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:01.310 --> 00:18:08.330
PROFESSOR STRANG: Yes, yeah.

00:18:08.330 --> 00:18:11.060
That's right, and it
will come out consistent.

00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:16.500
Yeah, if I take horizontal-- if
I take the same convention that

00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:22.920
forces that way are plus,
that's a plus f H 1,

00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:29.410
and it's a plus u H 1, then I'll
get A will go to A transpose.

00:18:29.410 --> 00:18:33.020
Yeah, so if I'm consistent
that plus for the u's,

00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:36.160
for the displacements, and
plus for the f's, forces,

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:40.510
then the correctly created
A will give me the correct A

00:18:40.510 --> 00:18:41.680
transpose.

00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:45.150
But A transpose
A has the ability

00:18:45.150 --> 00:18:51.640
to bury some of
those conventions.

00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:52.641
OK.

00:18:52.641 --> 00:18:53.140
Good.

00:18:53.140 --> 00:18:53.690
Yes.

00:18:53.690 --> 00:18:55.030
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:55.030 --> 00:18:56.540
PROFESSOR STRANG: Different.

00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:57.480
More.

00:18:57.480 --> 00:18:58.230
Oh my God.

00:18:58.230 --> 00:18:58.920
OK.

00:18:58.920 --> 00:18:59.420
Yes.

00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:08.536
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:08.536 --> 00:19:09.910
PROFESSOR STRANG:
This one, yeah.

00:19:09.910 --> 00:19:13.492
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:13.492 --> 00:19:14.450
PROFESSOR STRANG: Yeah.

00:19:14.450 --> 00:19:22.150
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:22.150 --> 00:19:27.360
PROFESSOR STRANG: I wish it
would ask about bar three.

00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:29.490
Yeah, yeah bar three was good.

00:19:29.490 --> 00:19:31.240
Yeah right.

00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:35.110
Yeah, I guess here, what's here,
well, the angle is, that must

00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:40.300
be theta, and then
this'll be right provided

00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:45.740
this number is the, is what?

00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:50.110
Well, I've got to
think it out again.

00:19:50.110 --> 00:19:56.510
I'll just think it out.

00:19:56.510 --> 00:19:59.120
Maybe, yeah I won't
try to, yeah I won't.

00:19:59.120 --> 00:19:59.720
I won't.

00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:03.730
So I think you--
But it's really,

00:20:03.730 --> 00:20:14.160
you learn the point by
thinking that through.

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:15.760
I think we've got it here.

00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:21.810
That if that's number one
then we like plus signs here

00:20:21.810 --> 00:20:27.320
because positive displacements
will stretch the bar, right.

00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:32.220
And here this sign will
depend on the angle.

00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:38.414
And it will depend on the
number, which numbers,

00:20:38.414 --> 00:20:40.580
what number that one is and
what number that one is.

00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:45.440
If I reverse the numbers,
then I reverse the sign.

00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:47.550
Yeah, good.

00:20:47.550 --> 00:20:52.530
Well, that's sort of part
of computational engineering

00:20:52.530 --> 00:20:53.090
isn't it?

00:20:53.090 --> 00:20:56.500
Like, keep track of the details.

00:20:56.500 --> 00:21:00.460
But of course this
18.085 course is also

00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:02.280
about big picture things.

00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:09.660
And that's what I'm hoping
comes through even better.

00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:12.270
OK, ready for another
question on any topic.

00:21:12.270 --> 00:21:17.265
Thank you.

00:21:17.265 --> 00:21:18.140
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:28.130
PROFESSOR STRANG: Yes.

00:21:28.130 --> 00:21:30.980
Well, no, but let's just try it.

00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:32.610
Shall we do Problem one?

00:21:32.610 --> 00:21:34.540
Was it Problem one?

00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:36.100
In 2.7?

00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:38.470
OK, let me just draw that truss.

00:21:38.470 --> 00:21:40.890
And let's just talk about it.

00:21:40.890 --> 00:21:44.780
So, boy I've put a
lot of bars in there.

00:21:44.780 --> 00:21:50.270
OK, so this is just one
bar down to this guy.

00:21:50.270 --> 00:21:53.830
And this is one up to here.

00:21:53.830 --> 00:21:56.420
And was that everything?

00:21:56.420 --> 00:21:58.510
OK, and then I've numbered them.

00:21:58.510 --> 00:22:01.190
Let me just copy
the number here,

00:22:01.190 --> 00:22:05.520
so that we can talk about that.

00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:08.470
And I numbered the
nodes one, two.

00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:09.950
One.

00:22:09.950 --> 00:22:12.350
Joints, I should say really.

00:22:12.350 --> 00:22:12.930
Four.

00:22:12.930 --> 00:22:15.200
OK, all right.

00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:17.350
Let's just start
as I always do by,

00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:20.710
what's the shape
of the matrix A?

00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:26.600
A is what, how many
bars have I got?

00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:29.430
So help me through this now.

00:22:29.430 --> 00:22:34.390
Six bars, and how many unknown
displacements have I got?

00:22:34.390 --> 00:22:36.290
Eight, OK, good.

00:22:36.290 --> 00:22:38.980
And have I got any
rigid motions here?

00:22:38.980 --> 00:22:40.510
No.

00:22:40.510 --> 00:22:47.150
I've got two, these are going to
prevent all the rigid motions.

00:22:47.150 --> 00:22:59.010
So if this matrix, if A has
rank six, which we'd probably

00:22:59.010 --> 00:23:08.880
guess it has, you know
that there's an if there.

00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:10.950
Then two mechanisms, right?

00:23:10.950 --> 00:23:14.330
Eight minus six
gives two mechanisms.

00:23:14.330 --> 00:23:19.100
OK, and your question
is how to find them.

00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:19.930
You've got one.

00:23:19.930 --> 00:23:21.290
Alright, which one have you got?

00:23:21.290 --> 00:23:24.832
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:24.832 --> 00:23:26.040
PROFESSOR STRANG: These guys.

00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:33.320
So tilt, so that's a mechanism
that only involves u H 1 and u

00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:36.300
H 2 and none of the other u's.

00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:39.250
OK, that looks good.

00:23:39.250 --> 00:23:41.500
So that's certainly one.

00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:44.190
Now we're looking
for a second one.

00:23:44.190 --> 00:23:46.900
What if, anybody suggest one?

00:23:46.900 --> 00:23:49.420
Let me just give
everybody a thought.

00:23:49.420 --> 00:23:52.760
If you haven't already
started on this homework,

00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:54.570
you're starting now.

00:23:54.570 --> 00:23:59.010
So I'm looking for
another mechanism,

00:23:59.010 --> 00:24:02.780
and of course you
might say well,

00:24:02.780 --> 00:24:06.910
suppose these bars go this way.

00:24:06.910 --> 00:24:09.920
Suppose they go to
the left, and you

00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:12.350
know that that's not
going to do it right.

00:24:12.350 --> 00:24:14.200
And why not?

00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:17.940
Why isn't that an
OK second answer?

00:24:17.940 --> 00:24:20.580
Because it's effectively the
same as the first; in fact

00:24:20.580 --> 00:24:25.710
the mechanism u, how would
the u, the one I've drawn

00:24:25.710 --> 00:24:33.300
and the u for this
way, what would we see?

00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:34.980
Opposite signs.

00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:38.864
If this describes a u 1
H and a u 2 H positive,

00:24:38.864 --> 00:24:40.280
the other way
they're negative, it

00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:43.590
would just be the opposite
sign, nothing new.

00:24:43.590 --> 00:24:48.620
OK, so now you've had
a look, so tell me.

00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:54.250
If somebody sees-- To
answer your question here,

00:24:54.250 --> 00:24:55.880
how do you see them?

00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:59.700
I don't know.

00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:03.100
Just look harder.

00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:06.190
Like you know, speaking French.

00:25:06.190 --> 00:25:12.770
Just say it louder
and maybe it'll work.

00:25:12.770 --> 00:25:14.970
Of course we do
have the possibility

00:25:14.970 --> 00:25:18.670
to create the matrix
and look for solutions.

00:25:18.670 --> 00:25:21.860
But it's more fun
to do it this way.

00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:25.930
And now who's going to
suggest another mechanism,

00:25:25.930 --> 00:25:26.650
another view?

00:25:26.650 --> 00:25:30.750
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:30.750 --> 00:25:36.590
PROFESSOR STRANG:
Three and four.

00:25:36.590 --> 00:25:39.560
Wait a minute, what
was that three?

00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:42.340
Oh, these nodes, OK.

00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:46.520
These nodes, three
and four do what?

00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:47.220
Oh yes, sorry.

00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:52.400
Three go up this way.

00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:53.360
Ah, I see.

00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:56.580
You're rotating.

00:25:56.580 --> 00:26:02.710
So this guy goes sort
of along this way,

00:26:02.710 --> 00:26:06.470
you're taking that top
square and turning it.

00:26:06.470 --> 00:26:10.720
OK, so these guys
will also turn, right?

00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:16.410
Yeah, one and two will
move on your mechanism.

00:26:16.410 --> 00:26:19.510
So the idea is take
that top thing,

00:26:19.510 --> 00:26:24.300
and I'm allowed to turn it,
I'd say I have to turn it,

00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:29.990
I have to keep this bar,
yeah I cannot stretch it.

00:26:29.990 --> 00:26:31.940
I can't stretch any bars.

00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:36.840
So when I do this turn, I can't
just keep it in place and turn.

00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:37.660
No.

00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:41.550
But I'm going to turn
it so that this one goes

00:26:41.550 --> 00:26:47.280
this way and this one
goes this way, and now.

00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:51.130
Alright you're, you're
responsible for telling me

00:26:51.130 --> 00:26:52.390
about the other two now.

00:26:52.390 --> 00:26:54.766
What do they do?

00:26:54.766 --> 00:26:55.640
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:58.056
PROFESSOR STRANG: Bar four,
Will bar four keep its length?

00:26:58.056 --> 00:27:01.740
Ha.

00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:03.970
OK, well we're not
allowed to use fancy words

00:27:03.970 --> 00:27:07.430
like four-bar linkage.

00:27:07.430 --> 00:27:09.550
Because somebody might
say what does that mean.

00:27:09.550 --> 00:27:11.900
OK, does it, do you see that?

00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:12.980
I think it does.

00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:15.600
But it's wonderful.

00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:19.580
If that's the original bar
and I bring this up a little,

00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:23.270
a little, remember,
and this down a little,

00:27:23.270 --> 00:27:30.020
I think that the new
bar has the same length.

00:27:30.020 --> 00:27:32.080
You believe that?

00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:33.560
No.

00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:38.170
Some, yeah, but
what happened there?

00:27:38.170 --> 00:27:41.222
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:41.222 --> 00:27:43.180
PROFESSOR STRANG: Yeah,
this is a good example.

00:27:43.180 --> 00:27:46.560
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:49.500
PROFESSOR STRANG: Sorry,
yeah, certainly bringing

00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:51.990
that up tended to
make the bar shorter,

00:27:51.990 --> 00:27:55.250
but then moving this down tended
to make it a little longer.

00:27:55.250 --> 00:27:57.322
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:57.322 --> 00:27:58.280
PROFESSOR STRANG: Right

00:27:58.280 --> 00:28:00.000
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:06.680
PROFESSOR STRANG:
Yeah, I think so.

00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:08.180
See, that was the key.

00:28:08.180 --> 00:28:12.560
We went at 90 degrees to five.

00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:16.940
And by going at 90 degrees,
then the stretch in there

00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:21.250
was only that one minus
cosine that was higher order.

00:28:21.250 --> 00:28:22.580
That's the key.

00:28:22.580 --> 00:28:25.290
Similarly, here,
all these-- So we're

00:28:25.290 --> 00:28:28.420
avoiding stretching
by this trick.

00:28:28.420 --> 00:28:31.630
So maybe this guy is
going down this same way.

00:28:31.630 --> 00:28:34.390
And this guy is going
up that same way.

00:28:34.390 --> 00:28:39.830
Yeah, because then that
bar is just translating,

00:28:39.830 --> 00:28:42.580
and this bar is
translating and these two

00:28:42.580 --> 00:28:49.530
are doing the same thing, which
I believe is not stretching.

00:28:49.530 --> 00:28:53.080
Is this the answer that
maybe somebody already got?

00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:55.000
And believed in?

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:55.960
Yeah.

00:28:55.960 --> 00:29:00.910
So to answer your original
question, it wasn't obvious,

00:29:00.910 --> 00:29:02.250
was it?

00:29:02.250 --> 00:29:06.800
But I think that
is the right thing.

00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:11.270
And actually, you could
create the A for this problem.

00:29:11.270 --> 00:29:13.980
Well, it's a bit
large, 48 entries,

00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:19.600
but because four of the bars
are horizontal or vertical,

00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:24.670
you will have many, many,
many, zeroes in the A matrix.

00:29:24.670 --> 00:29:26.210
It would be sort
of fun to create

00:29:26.210 --> 00:29:28.000
the A matrix and then this.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:31.970
So what is this displacement
that I believe in?

00:29:31.970 --> 00:29:35.860
This u mechanism that
we've talked about.

00:29:35.860 --> 00:29:40.770
Let's see, if I look at one
that was positive positive.

00:29:40.770 --> 00:29:46.580
If I looked at node two, that
was positive over but down.

00:29:46.580 --> 00:29:49.340
So horizontal but down.

00:29:49.340 --> 00:29:53.470
If I look at node three,
that's positive positive.

00:29:53.470 --> 00:29:56.660
Yeah, one and three
is hanging on.

00:29:56.660 --> 00:30:00.840
And number four is like
number two, one and minus one.

00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:05.590
I think that's the u
which should solve Au=0.

00:30:09.020 --> 00:30:11.030
Yeah.

00:30:11.030 --> 00:30:11.580
OK.

00:30:11.580 --> 00:30:16.560
But that's a good example.

00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:19.600
OK, so that's trusses.

00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:21.475
What else?

00:30:21.475 --> 00:30:22.350
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:22.350 --> 00:30:23.516
PROFESSOR STRANG: Thank you.

00:30:23.516 --> 00:30:25.720
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:28.790
PROFESSOR STRANG:
Oh, well, let's see.

00:30:28.790 --> 00:30:33.400
That's a good question
and now I guess we're, ah.

00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:37.200
Yeah well, the way I've
drawn it at 45 degrees, which

00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:41.500
is what I wrote here,
then I did build in,

00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:45.890
I did make that a forty--
I did make this 45 or 135

00:30:45.890 --> 00:30:47.460
or something.

00:30:47.460 --> 00:30:51.790
And 45.

00:30:51.790 --> 00:30:54.840
To get that, if that
goes at 45 degrees,

00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:58.170
then this had better
go at 135, right?

00:30:58.170 --> 00:31:01.880
So that has to be a right angle.

00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:06.160
If the support
was over here then

00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:11.700
the angle that would have
gone off with was changed.

00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:15.020
Yeah, so very good point,
that the numbers I've

00:31:15.020 --> 00:31:18.970
written down on the picture
I drew required these angles

00:31:18.970 --> 00:31:25.040
to be those nice numbers.

00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:27.040
I hope you like these
trusses a little.

00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:40.430
I mean, you get some freedom
to visualize a little.

00:31:40.430 --> 00:31:41.250
Good, yes.

00:31:41.250 --> 00:32:01.951
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:01.951 --> 00:32:02.950
PROFESSOR STRANG: Maybe.

00:32:02.950 --> 00:32:03.560
Let me see.

00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:06.410
I thought you were
going to say, could I

00:32:06.410 --> 00:32:14.070
have two and three go inwards
and one and four go outwards?

00:32:14.070 --> 00:32:15.810
You don't like that.

00:32:15.810 --> 00:32:21.590
I would go with that.

00:32:21.590 --> 00:32:22.540
Is that any good?

00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:24.000
Well, OK.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.360
Yeah, linear
algebra spoke there.

00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:28.825
It's a combination of
the other two, yes.

00:32:28.825 --> 00:32:30.200
If we only got a
two-dimensional.

00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:33.696
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:33.696 --> 00:32:34.820
PROFESSOR STRANG: That one.

00:32:34.820 --> 00:32:36.105
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:36.105 --> 00:32:36.980
PROFESSOR STRANG: OK.

00:32:36.980 --> 00:32:38.092
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:38.092 --> 00:32:39.050
PROFESSOR STRANG: Yeah.

00:32:39.050 --> 00:32:42.552
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:42.552 --> 00:32:43.510
PROFESSOR STRANG: Yeah.

00:32:43.510 --> 00:32:45.872
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:45.872 --> 00:32:46.830
PROFESSOR STRANG: Yeah.

00:32:46.830 --> 00:32:51.270
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:51.270 --> 00:32:54.130
PROFESSOR STRANG: OK.

00:32:54.130 --> 00:33:00.190
But let me-- When you
suggested one, I overwrote it.

00:33:00.190 --> 00:33:07.130
Now, the one you suggested--
When you told me,

00:33:07.130 --> 00:33:10.890
OK, bring these in, I thought,
OK, these have to go out.

00:33:10.890 --> 00:33:19.347
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:19.347 --> 00:33:21.680
PROFESSOR STRANG: They're not
allowed to change lengths,

00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:25.550
so they can only swing
around these pin joints.

00:33:25.550 --> 00:33:33.130
So the picture of the one that
I drew after your question

00:33:33.130 --> 00:33:37.970
would be, these guys, this
guy, let me draw the square,

00:33:37.970 --> 00:33:39.120
as it was.

00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:41.670
And then these guys
came in a little.

00:33:41.670 --> 00:33:44.400
These guys went out a little.

00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:45.620
And we got this.

00:33:45.620 --> 00:33:51.757
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:51.757 --> 00:33:53.090
PROFESSOR STRANG: No, that's OK.

00:33:53.090 --> 00:33:57.430
I think this is legitimate,
this is a legitimate one.

00:33:57.430 --> 00:34:04.090
And that bar, every bar now is
doing the same kind of thing

00:34:04.090 --> 00:34:04.950
that this one did.

00:34:04.950 --> 00:34:07.770
This moved a little,
but this compensated

00:34:07.770 --> 00:34:10.680
and kept the length the same.

00:34:10.680 --> 00:34:18.640
Your question has led us
to another nifty mechanism.

00:34:18.640 --> 00:34:20.880
It's good, a good
one to think about.

00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:33.642
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:33.642 --> 00:34:34.600
PROFESSOR STRANG: Yeah.

00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:36.880
It's movement
without stretching.

00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:40.370
Movement without
stretching is the key, yes.

00:34:40.370 --> 00:34:43.530
And then where
does collapse come?

00:34:43.530 --> 00:34:46.880
So I use the word
collapse pretty freely.

00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:49.240
So the word collapse
comes in because since it

00:34:49.240 --> 00:34:52.650
can move without stretching
there's nothing controlling it,

00:34:52.650 --> 00:34:59.160
it can move-- Well,
if we stayed linear,

00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:02.640
then I could make all
those ten and the thing

00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:05.110
would be even worse, of course.

00:35:05.110 --> 00:35:10.900
The truth is that if I
made those even one or ten

00:35:10.900 --> 00:35:13.440
I would be out of
the linear range.

00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:16.760
These all should be
0.01's or something.

00:35:16.760 --> 00:35:20.440
But linear we don't
know the difference.

00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:24.040
OK, I'm glad you've
got that suggestion.

00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:26.580
And now somebody correctly
says that this one

00:35:26.580 --> 00:35:29.730
must be some combination
of that and what

00:35:29.730 --> 00:35:31.060
was the first movement?

00:35:31.060 --> 00:35:35.890
Oh, the upper two.

00:35:35.890 --> 00:35:38.320
Which it must be.

00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:43.850
Amazing, how many-- Put a few
bars up there and you got it.

00:35:43.850 --> 00:35:44.510
Yeah.

00:35:44.510 --> 00:35:47.750
And of course, by
the way, and don't

00:35:47.750 --> 00:35:50.320
let me get too far
into this discussion,

00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:55.460
but who is the artist,
actually is it Alexander Calder

00:35:55.460 --> 00:35:57.800
who has, what are they called?

00:35:57.800 --> 00:36:03.960
You know, they're-- What
was it called again?

00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:06.480
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
PROFESSOR STRANG:

00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:09.290
Well, he has those, that wasn't
the word I was thinking of.

00:36:09.290 --> 00:36:12.490
But he's created these
trusses, like with lots

00:36:12.490 --> 00:36:15.720
of bars and lots of nodes that
have some special property.

00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:17.260
You know, they just, anyway.

00:36:17.260 --> 00:36:26.770
It touches on art, actually
this theory of mechanisms.

00:36:26.770 --> 00:36:30.370
Yeah it's really
quite interesting.

00:36:30.370 --> 00:36:33.880
But then linear algebra
somehow tells you

00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:37.790
just from these numbers how many
mechanisms you're looking for.

00:36:37.790 --> 00:36:40.890
Which is pretty cool.

00:36:40.890 --> 00:36:45.170
OK, open for more questions.

00:36:45.170 --> 00:36:48.530
You probably haven't
looked ahead,

00:36:48.530 --> 00:36:51.970
I mean today's
lecture was a-- I hope

00:36:51.970 --> 00:36:59.530
and I left up there the
central topics for the lecture.

00:36:59.530 --> 00:37:03.730
But I'm, I think,
correct that you haven't

00:37:03.730 --> 00:37:06.330
started on those problems.

00:37:06.330 --> 00:37:08.390
To know what to ask.

00:37:08.390 --> 00:37:11.930
Let me ask you a question,
which was not in the lecture.

00:37:11.930 --> 00:37:15.500
Suppose I wanted to
use finite differences.

00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:18.420
It's a little bit like
the one on the quiz.

00:37:18.420 --> 00:37:23.860
So on the quiz we had c,
equal ones, and then c=2.

00:37:23.860 --> 00:37:26.260
And you knew c had
to be four by four,

00:37:26.260 --> 00:37:31.710
so most people correctly got the
diagonal as one, one, two, two.

00:37:31.710 --> 00:37:35.140
Just by sort of common sense.

00:37:35.140 --> 00:37:38.000
But what would be
a finite difference

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:40.940
approximation to our equation?

00:37:40.940 --> 00:37:44.550
So suppose I didn't
go to finite elements,

00:37:44.550 --> 00:37:47.590
but instead I stayed with
finite differences, which

00:37:47.590 --> 00:37:52.200
would be completely fine in
1-D, completely sensible.

00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:56.180
How would you create a finite
difference thing for that?

00:37:56.180 --> 00:38:00.500
Let me just bring down
a blank board and ask.

00:38:00.500 --> 00:38:02.560
So you see the equation?

00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:04.310
Let me write it again here.

00:38:04.310 --> 00:38:08.700
So I want to replace this
equation with a varying-- that

00:38:08.700 --> 00:38:09.710
has varying c(x).

00:38:12.550 --> 00:38:14.400
Well, I won't worry
about the right side.

00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:16.510
It's f.

00:38:16.510 --> 00:38:24.690
What's my K matrix using
finite differences for this?

00:38:24.690 --> 00:38:27.150
We're going to create
a finite element K

00:38:27.150 --> 00:38:32.020
matrix by the weak
form, Galerkin trial

00:38:32.020 --> 00:38:34.240
function, that route.

00:38:34.240 --> 00:38:37.580
That's coming-- That's very
important, that's coming,

00:38:37.580 --> 00:38:41.950
started today and it'll
be completed Friday.

00:38:41.950 --> 00:38:48.150
But now suppose we were back
up to finite differences.

00:38:48.150 --> 00:38:54.590
What would you take for
finite differences there?

00:38:54.590 --> 00:38:58.530
When the c wasn't
there, what did we do?

00:38:58.530 --> 00:39:00.780
Then we just had second
difference, right?

00:39:00.780 --> 00:39:02.450
How did we get the
second difference?

00:39:02.450 --> 00:39:06.650
It was a first difference
of a first difference.

00:39:06.650 --> 00:39:12.950
I guess I would probably-- This
I would probably approximate

00:39:12.950 --> 00:39:21.550
by (u_(i+1)-u_i) over delta x.

00:39:21.550 --> 00:39:29.080
That would be that, and so
what should I put for c(x)?

00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:31.190
What would you suggest?

00:39:34.550 --> 00:39:41.330
c subscript i, so let's mark.

00:39:41.330 --> 00:39:43.920
Here's i, and here's
i+1, and here's i-1.

00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:51.770
We're going to end up with
those three guys involved.

00:39:51.770 --> 00:40:00.780
So this takes this difference,
and then this one will take

00:40:00.780 --> 00:40:07.300
that one, and then I'll also
have a u_i-u_(i-1) over delta

00:40:07.300 --> 00:40:08.570
x.

00:40:08.570 --> 00:40:10.120
And somehow that'll
be the difference

00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:11.440
of these differences.

00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:13.410
But now tell me
again, what would

00:40:13.410 --> 00:40:18.940
be the really cool choice of c?

00:40:18.940 --> 00:40:24.220
What's your instinct where
what value of c to take?

00:40:24.220 --> 00:40:27.280
As sort of average.

00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:29.160
I mean you could
take it just halfway.

00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:33.940
I think I would take
c_(i+1/2) there.

00:40:33.940 --> 00:40:37.780
Just as being sort of right.

00:40:37.780 --> 00:40:44.670
And here I would take c_(i-1/2),
halfway along its interval.

00:40:44.670 --> 00:40:50.340
And then the second difference
takes the difference of it.

00:40:50.340 --> 00:40:55.940
So now I've got-- I think
that's what I would do.

00:40:55.940 --> 00:40:59.750
That would be my typical,
one typical finite difference

00:40:59.750 --> 00:41:00.760
equation.

00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:04.430
Would be the
difference times its c

00:41:04.430 --> 00:41:07.840
and I took its c
to be symmetric.

00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:09.980
You could also have
taken, if you'd liked,

00:41:09.980 --> 00:41:12.320
if you wanted to
stay at these points,

00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:16.530
you could do twice as much
work and take, let me say,

00:41:16.530 --> 00:41:24.270
or-- So either c_(i+1/2),
or you could average the c_i

00:41:24.270 --> 00:41:27.370
and the c_(i+1) over two.

00:41:27.370 --> 00:41:32.190
And both of those would
give you that extra accuracy

00:41:32.190 --> 00:41:35.360
that you pick up from
sort of keeping symmetry

00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:38.530
where you should.

00:41:38.530 --> 00:41:42.200
So I think, I mean, this would
be the quicker one to put,

00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:46.050
that one would be OK too.

00:41:46.050 --> 00:41:49.370
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:41:49.370 --> 00:41:52.660
PROFESSOR STRANG: This was just
for your entertainment not,

00:41:52.660 --> 00:41:55.155
not-- Yes, go ahead.

00:41:55.155 --> 00:41:56.030
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:41:56.030 --> 00:41:57.863
PROFESSOR STRANG: Ah,
when c was a step yes.

00:41:57.863 --> 00:41:58.750
When c was a step.

00:41:58.750 --> 00:42:05.350
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:05.350 --> 00:42:14.960
PROFESSOR STRANG: c_(i+1/2)
Probably the step-- Yeah, yeah.

00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:16.080
Yeah.

00:42:16.080 --> 00:42:21.600
Let me ask you, what happens
in this equation when c jumps?

00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:23.780
It jumped on the quiz.

00:42:23.780 --> 00:42:27.980
But I didn't require you
to solve the differential

00:42:27.980 --> 00:42:31.580
equation, only to create
the finite difference model,

00:42:31.580 --> 00:42:36.410
to create the A transpose C A,
and most people did it fine.

00:42:36.410 --> 00:42:40.570
But suppose c jumps.

00:42:40.570 --> 00:42:44.170
I have some simple
right-hand side like one.

00:42:44.170 --> 00:42:46.040
It's not a jump in
the right-hand side

00:42:46.040 --> 00:42:47.230
I'm interested in.

00:42:47.230 --> 00:42:50.890
It's a jump in c
from one to two.

00:42:50.890 --> 00:42:53.610
So this is a topic that
the book does discuss

00:42:53.610 --> 00:42:57.410
and maybe I might come back
to it in the ordinary lecture.

00:42:57.410 --> 00:43:03.120
But, while it's in
front of us now,

00:43:03.120 --> 00:43:09.960
the quiz was sort of intended
to help you with that.

00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:15.800
How do I interpret this
equation when c has a jump?

00:43:15.800 --> 00:43:18.990
Well, it's actually,
if you look at it

00:43:18.990 --> 00:43:20.600
right there's no difficulty.

00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:25.450
That equation is a combination
of this equation -dw/dx equals

00:43:25.450 --> 00:43:27.360
the one.

00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:35.550
And the equation of
c*du/dx equalling the w.

00:43:35.550 --> 00:43:38.710
I split it out for
you in the last part,

00:43:38.710 --> 00:43:41.260
Problem 4b in the quiz.

00:43:41.260 --> 00:43:45.520
I really helped you to
say OK, take these two

00:43:45.520 --> 00:43:47.980
separate equations.

00:43:47.980 --> 00:43:50.830
And now you don't
really have a problem.

00:43:50.830 --> 00:43:55.350
The equation for w, nothing
is out of the ordinary there.

00:43:55.350 --> 00:43:57.460
Jump in c is not even seen.

00:43:57.460 --> 00:43:59.450
So then you've got the w.

00:43:59.450 --> 00:44:04.100
Now, you have the c in
it with its little jump.

00:44:04.100 --> 00:44:10.560
But, so suppose I find w
from the first equation.

00:44:10.560 --> 00:44:14.250
How do I find u?

00:44:14.250 --> 00:44:15.870
I just divide by the c.

00:44:15.870 --> 00:44:17.720
And integrate.

00:44:17.720 --> 00:44:19.900
Yeah.

00:44:19.900 --> 00:44:24.350
What I'm saying, let
me say it, clearly now.

00:44:24.350 --> 00:44:29.250
If there's a jump in c,
that's not a bad thing.

00:44:29.250 --> 00:44:34.780
Because the point is
there's no jump in c*u'.

00:44:34.780 --> 00:44:39.070
c*du/dx doesn't
jump. w doesn't jump.

00:44:39.070 --> 00:44:40.300
From a jump in c.

00:44:40.300 --> 00:44:43.850
If c jumps, let it.

00:44:43.850 --> 00:44:49.790
There's no jump in w, which
is the serious unknown.

00:44:49.790 --> 00:44:52.560
There'll be a jump
in du/dx, and that

00:44:52.560 --> 00:44:56.550
was that e thing that
you had on the quiz.

00:44:56.550 --> 00:45:00.090
There'll be a jump in du/dx
to compensate the jump in c,

00:45:00.090 --> 00:45:03.440
but w is good.

00:45:03.440 --> 00:45:08.040
That's the message of--
So let me write that down.

00:45:08.040 --> 00:45:22.700
Even if c jumps, w does not.

00:45:22.700 --> 00:45:26.860
So my point is when
you're looking at w,

00:45:26.860 --> 00:45:29.240
you're looking at
the right quantity.

00:45:29.240 --> 00:45:35.040
And it deals, this is the
sort of general feature

00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:37.990
that if you look at it
right it's not a problem.

00:45:37.990 --> 00:45:43.010
If you look at it wrong and
try to write out that equation,

00:45:43.010 --> 00:45:45.930
take the second
derivative of this is OK,

00:45:45.930 --> 00:45:48.770
but then if you just try to
take the derivative of the jump,

00:45:48.770 --> 00:45:51.180
you think, my God
there's a delta function

00:45:51.180 --> 00:45:55.870
sitting in my equation,
what am I to do.

00:45:55.870 --> 00:45:59.750
Don't do it.

00:45:59.750 --> 00:46:07.380
That pair of equations
is no trouble.

00:46:07.380 --> 00:46:09.460
Do you see that point?

00:46:09.460 --> 00:46:17.700
That a jump in c is really OK.
c=0 wouldn't be so good, right?

00:46:17.700 --> 00:46:21.940
If c went to zero then you
have got some problems here,

00:46:21.940 --> 00:46:25.560
because if c is zero
here what's going on?

00:46:25.560 --> 00:46:35.440
So your material should
have some stiffness,

00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:37.440
some positive stiffness.

00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:39.250
Zero stiffness
would be a problem.

00:46:39.250 --> 00:46:42.980
Negative stiffness
would be really

00:46:42.980 --> 00:46:45.940
a crazy material, where
you add more force

00:46:45.940 --> 00:46:52.460
and it compresses on you.

00:46:52.460 --> 00:47:00.890
OK so that was a point I could
make also in the lecture.

00:47:00.890 --> 00:47:04.250
Other questions.

00:47:04.250 --> 00:47:09.450
I hope you find these
review sessions--

00:47:09.450 --> 00:47:16.510
They give a chance to
bring out more points.

00:47:16.510 --> 00:47:19.900
Let me say a little bit
about Chapter 2 things

00:47:19.900 --> 00:47:26.270
that we abandoned without
including in the lectures.

00:47:26.270 --> 00:47:30.130
One very important thing
that we didn't touch

00:47:30.130 --> 00:47:32.670
was the non-linear problems.

00:47:32.670 --> 00:47:40.550
Where in the end you
have to solve a system

00:47:40.550 --> 00:47:43.020
of non-linear equations.

00:47:43.020 --> 00:47:46.090
We've only had linear
equations, Ku=f,

00:47:46.090 --> 00:47:52.010
where we almost got to-- And
we've certainly found enough

00:47:52.010 --> 00:47:53.750
to discuss there.

00:47:53.750 --> 00:47:56.840
But how do you deal with
non-linear equations?

00:47:56.840 --> 00:48:03.650
Well so that's
Section 2.6, I guess.

00:48:03.650 --> 00:48:09.060
And the answer is Newton's
method, or some version,

00:48:09.060 --> 00:48:11.620
there are many versions
of Newton's method.

00:48:11.620 --> 00:48:18.720
So all I'm saying is
that's an important topic.

00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:21.060
How to deal with
non-linear equations.

00:48:21.060 --> 00:48:27.020
And the answer is usually some
variation of Newton's method.

00:48:27.020 --> 00:48:29.110
Depending on how
many equations you've

00:48:29.110 --> 00:48:34.230
got, how bad the non-linearity
is, and things like that.

00:48:34.230 --> 00:48:40.720
It's a case where
coding is not so simple.

00:48:40.720 --> 00:48:42.330
But important.

00:48:42.330 --> 00:48:45.380
So that's one thing in
Chapter 2 that we've

00:48:45.380 --> 00:48:51.280
passed, because really this
is where we want to be today.

00:48:51.280 --> 00:48:54.140
Other topics,
questions of any kind?

00:48:54.140 --> 00:48:54.860
Yes, thanks.

00:48:54.860 --> 00:48:57.350
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:48:57.350 --> 00:48:58.870
PROFESSOR STRANG:
This problem, OK.

00:48:58.870 --> 00:49:01.825
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:49:01.825 --> 00:49:02.700
PROFESSOR STRANG: Yes

00:49:02.700 --> 00:49:16.960
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] Well, OK.

00:49:16.960 --> 00:49:19.230
Right, good question.

00:49:19.230 --> 00:49:20.210
You're right.

00:49:20.210 --> 00:49:25.040
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:26.220
PROFESSOR STRANG: Yeah, OK.

00:49:26.220 --> 00:49:29.700
So now suppose that delta
of x was in-- delta of x-a,

00:49:29.700 --> 00:49:31.490
the jump at a, was there.

00:49:31.490 --> 00:49:38.870
What would change in there?

00:49:38.870 --> 00:49:40.920
Well, the one would
change, right?

00:49:40.920 --> 00:49:45.370
The one would now
be the delta of x-a.

00:49:45.370 --> 00:49:48.300
So what am I seeing now?

00:49:48.300 --> 00:49:51.290
What's the jump situation now?

00:49:51.290 --> 00:49:56.760
Is there a jump in, does w jump
now from this delta function?

00:49:56.760 --> 00:49:58.250
Yes.

00:49:58.250 --> 00:50:01.990
It did not jump
from the jump in c.

00:50:01.990 --> 00:50:04.070
That did not produce
us a jump in w.

00:50:04.070 --> 00:50:04.670
Why not?

00:50:04.670 --> 00:50:13.690
Because again, back to the jump
in c, you have a bar of copper

00:50:13.690 --> 00:50:16.370
and you have a bar of steel.

00:50:16.370 --> 00:50:19.030
And they have different c's.

00:50:19.030 --> 00:50:24.090
But the force at that point,
when it's in equilibrium,

00:50:24.090 --> 00:50:28.410
the bar's not
falling apart, right?

00:50:28.410 --> 00:50:33.440
The force is the same from above
and below; equilibrium holds.

00:50:33.440 --> 00:50:39.290
It's just that the force
involves a c_1 there,

00:50:39.290 --> 00:50:45.260
and down here the force involves
a c_2 multiplying the du/dx,

00:50:45.260 --> 00:50:46.790
and this stretching.

00:50:46.790 --> 00:50:50.980
So the stretching
rule changes. du/dx,

00:50:50.980 --> 00:50:54.800
the stretching factor will be
different in the two materials.

00:50:54.800 --> 00:50:57.160
But the force won't be.

00:50:57.160 --> 00:50:59.430
You really have to
keep straight what--

00:50:59.430 --> 00:51:02.740
Now, you asked about
a delta function, OK.

00:51:02.740 --> 00:51:05.450
So now if I hang a
delta function there,

00:51:05.450 --> 00:51:08.830
that's like hanging a
point load at a point.

00:51:08.830 --> 00:51:10.430
What happens at that point?

00:51:10.430 --> 00:51:14.640
Well, we don't have
a problem with that.

00:51:14.640 --> 00:51:17.670
Well, w jumps.

00:51:17.670 --> 00:51:21.190
The force pulling up is
not the same as the force

00:51:21.190 --> 00:51:25.490
pulling down because there's
this extra point load.

00:51:25.490 --> 00:51:29.080
So the balance there
and the balance there,

00:51:29.080 --> 00:51:30.660
those aren't equal.

00:51:30.660 --> 00:51:35.730
There's a jump there because of
the point load being put there.

00:51:35.730 --> 00:51:40.470
So that produces a jump
in w, but not a jump in u.

00:51:40.470 --> 00:51:46.160
Not a jump in u, the bar
is still holding together.

00:51:46.160 --> 00:51:50.340
And since time's
running out I don't

00:51:50.340 --> 00:51:55.510
have to ask myself, or ask you,
about the worst possibility

00:51:55.510 --> 00:51:58.940
that occurs to me,
which is suppose

00:51:58.940 --> 00:52:01.230
they happen at the same place.

00:52:01.230 --> 00:52:06.500
Suppose there's a jump
in c and a point load.

00:52:06.500 --> 00:52:12.030
Do we want to face that,
what would happen there?

00:52:12.030 --> 00:52:17.300
Suppose, a was the
place where this jumped.

00:52:17.300 --> 00:52:20.070
Suppose the point load was here.

00:52:20.070 --> 00:52:21.890
What's up there?

00:52:21.890 --> 00:52:24.020
Well, maybe I will
able to do that.

00:52:24.020 --> 00:52:26.540
OK, so I'm putting
the point load

00:52:26.540 --> 00:52:32.670
at the place where the
copper and the steel meet.

00:52:32.670 --> 00:52:34.950
Is w continuous?

00:52:34.950 --> 00:52:39.040
Is the force the same
above and below that joint?

00:52:39.040 --> 00:52:39.600
No.

00:52:39.600 --> 00:52:44.560
Because there's these extra
terms from the weight.

00:52:44.560 --> 00:52:48.100
And then once you
know the forces, then

00:52:48.100 --> 00:52:52.560
above the bar you're solving
for u with one c, and then

00:52:52.560 --> 00:52:56.830
below that point
with the other c.

00:52:56.830 --> 00:53:03.930
So w has a plus and a minus
and c has a plus and a minus.

00:53:03.930 --> 00:53:12.120
And you're solving this one,
let me make them minus plus.

00:53:12.120 --> 00:53:17.610
So you're solving this
one in one bar, one metal.

00:53:17.610 --> 00:53:20.800
And c plus and the w
plus in the other method.

00:53:20.800 --> 00:53:25.660
So yeah, you can do it.

00:53:25.660 --> 00:53:30.200
Shall I just repeat what
my overall message is?

00:53:30.200 --> 00:53:33.690
w is the right thing to look at.

00:53:33.690 --> 00:53:38.090
That combination c*du/dx is
the right thing to look at.

00:53:38.090 --> 00:53:43.050
And it's what sits there.

00:53:43.050 --> 00:53:45.650
In those parentheses.

00:53:45.650 --> 00:53:50.630
OK, good, so that's
some review topics.

00:53:50.630 --> 00:53:54.090
We really have a lot of fun
ahead now with finite elements.

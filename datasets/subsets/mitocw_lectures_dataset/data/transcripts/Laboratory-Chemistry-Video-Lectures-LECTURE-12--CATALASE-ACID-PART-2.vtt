SARAH HEWETT:
Today, we are going

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.920
to talk about the second
part of the catalase lab.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.990
So, in the first
part of the catalase,

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.500
we had catalase and
hydrogen peroxide.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.980
And we were measuring the
rate of the decomposition

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:29.450
of hydrogen peroxide
as catalyzed

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:30.962
by the catalase enzyme.

00:00:30.962 --> 00:00:32.420
And we were doing
that by measuring

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:33.740
the pressure of oxygen.

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:36.032
And, for the people
who are currently

00:00:36.032 --> 00:00:38.240
doing the catalase lab,
you've already done part one.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:39.698
And, for everybody
else, you'll get

00:00:39.698 --> 00:00:42.740
to experience that coming
up in the next lab or two.

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:44.750
And then, in part two
of the catalase lab,

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.352
we are going to
look at quantifying

00:00:47.352 --> 00:00:49.310
the amount of catalase
that we have in a sample

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:52.460
and then looking at the
iron centers in the catalase

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.530
and trying to quantify
those as well.

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.430
So we are going to go
back to the beginning

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.010
and talk a little bit more about
proteins and protein structure.

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.018
So, if you have taken
a biology course

00:01:04.018 --> 00:01:06.560
at any point in your life, then
this will probably be review.

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.435
But, just so that we're
all on the same page,

00:01:08.435 --> 00:01:11.900
we want to go back and say that
the building blocks of proteins

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.290
are amino acids.

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.840
And this is the general
structure of an amino acid.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.510
And, if you change
this R group here

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:21.648
to any one of these R
groups over in this table,

00:01:21.648 --> 00:01:23.690
then you can get all of
the different amino acids

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:26.300
that are naturally
produced in nature.

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.120
And there are 20 amino
acids that occur in nature.

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.400
And they vary by these R groups.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.900
And, depending on
the R group, there

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.740
are different classes of
amino acids that you can have.

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:37.850
So there are the
nonpolar ones where

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.190
you have an alkyl or
an aromatic side chain.

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.530
You can have polar
side groups where

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:48.320
you have a hydroxyl group or
a thiol or some amine groups.

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.210
And then you can have
acidic or basic groups

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:51.460
that are electrically charged.

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.127
So, depending on the
pH of the solution,

00:01:53.127 --> 00:01:54.630
they'll either be
protonated or not.

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.797
And then you can have
positive and negative charges.

00:01:56.797 --> 00:01:59.750
And all of those contribute
to the protein structure

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.750
and the properties of the
protein, what it can do.

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.553
And just a review
of terminology,

00:02:04.553 --> 00:02:06.470
so proteins are made of
chains of amino acids.

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.590
A peptide is two or more
amino acids stuck together.

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.210
A polypeptide is when you get
10 or more amino acids stuck

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.710
together.

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.758
And then, if you
have beyond that,

00:02:15.758 --> 00:02:18.050
once it gets to longer and
longer chains of amino acids

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:19.550
and they start
folding up and having

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.142
specific functions, that's
when it becomes a protein.

00:02:22.142 --> 00:02:23.600
So, if you hear
those terms, that's

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.830
what we're talking about.

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.970
So the first-- the
most basic structure

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.560
that you can have in a protein
is the primary structure.

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.778
And that is just the
sequence of amino acids.

00:02:33.778 --> 00:02:35.570
So you have this long
chain of amino acids.

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:36.620
You stick them together.

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.220
And that is the
primary structure.

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.490
So, if this is our little
peptide chain here,

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:43.280
we have alanine, threonine,
tyrosine, and valine.

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.707
And those are from
these side groups is how

00:02:46.707 --> 00:02:48.650
you know what amino acid it is.

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.590
And then the bond in
between the amino acids here

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.020
where your carbonyl group
of one amino acid bonds

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.300
to the amine group of
another amino acid, that

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:57.842
is your peptide bond.

00:02:57.842 --> 00:02:59.300
And so you can get
chains of these,

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:02.180
and the primary structure
again is just the list

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.550
of amino acids in a line.

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:07.400
That's about as
simple as it gets.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.340
The secondary structure is
how the amino acids interact

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.756
with one another to
form 3D structures

00:03:14.756 --> 00:03:16.830
within the polypeptide chain.

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:18.785
So, if you have two
chains of amino acids

00:03:18.785 --> 00:03:20.660
or if you have one that's
folded onto itself,

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.115
it can form hydrogen bonds
between these oxygens

00:03:23.115 --> 00:03:24.740
of the carbonyls and
the hydrogens that

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:28.070
are attached to the nitrogens
in the protein backbone.

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:29.480
And you can get
these beta sheets

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.470
that are kind of pleated if
you look at them in actual 3D

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:34.670
space.

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.340
And you can have one
long chain that bonds

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.160
to itself in the similar fashion
with the hydrogen bonding.

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.080
And you can get alpha helices.

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.050
And it creates a helical shape
within the protein backbone.

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:47.612
And these are the main types
of secondary structures

00:03:47.612 --> 00:03:48.320
that you can get.

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.028
There are other ways
that the protein can

00:03:50.028 --> 00:03:52.760
interact with itself and
form different structures,

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.640
but these are the major two.

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.920
Structures are held together
using hydrogen bonds.

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:02.437
And then you can get
tertiary structure.

00:04:02.437 --> 00:04:04.520
So there are many different
ways that proteins are

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.870
represented in graphical form.

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:07.970
So you can have--

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:10.993
you've seen in our past
lecture with the catalase,

00:04:10.993 --> 00:04:13.160
you can have a space-filling
model where all of it's

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:14.840
kind of like the ball
and stick where it just

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:15.980
looks like one giant blob.

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:18.920
And that can give you a
sense of the overall shape

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:20.390
of the protein.

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:22.010
You can also have
line structures

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:23.120
where it's kind of
like the line structure

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.350
that you would draw
in organic chemistry

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:25.670
where it shows all
of the different side

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:26.840
chains in the backbone.

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.210
And then you have
these ribbon structures

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:31.310
where you can see sort
of the alpha helices

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:32.900
and maybe some beta
sheets over here.

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.150
And it shows some
different features

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.190
of the structure of a protein.

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:39.620
But the tertiary
structure is how

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.930
all of the elements of
the secondary structure

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:44.850
interact to form the overall
shape of the protein.

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:47.250
And it can be formed by
various interactions.

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:49.850
And so, while the secondary
structure is mostly

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:55.680
formed by interactions between
the backbone functional groups,

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.010
the, tertiary structure
comes from the interactions

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:59.010
between the side chains.

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:00.927
So you can have these
hydrophobic interactions

00:05:00.927 --> 00:05:03.950
if you have alkyl or
aromatic side chains.

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:06.630
So, if your protein
is in a cell,

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:08.850
then it is in a mostly
aqueous environment.

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:10.320
And aqueous
environments are polar.

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.450
And so these
nonpolar groups will

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:14.790
tend to coagulate together.

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:16.090
You can have disulfide bonds.

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:20.040
So, if you have the protein side
chains that have sulfur groups,

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:23.680
then they can make covalent
bonds between the sulfurs.

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:24.930
You can have hydrogen bonding.

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:28.380
Again, those
different side chains

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:31.230
have again hydrogens
that are attached

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:33.990
to nitrogens and oxygens
and carbonyl groups

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:35.370
that can form hydrogen bonds.

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:38.160
And then those electrically
charged side chains

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:39.130
can form salt bridges.

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:40.630
So, if you have a
positively charged

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:43.110
and a negatively charged
amino acid near each other,

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:46.222
then they can have an ionic
interaction like that.

00:05:46.222 --> 00:05:48.180
Interactions with the
solvent also play a role.

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:50.210
And this is what holds
the protein together

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:54.110
in its functional shape.

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:56.990
And then, lastly, we have
our quaternary structure.

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:58.820
And this is formed
by the interaction

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:00.440
of multiple subunits
coming together

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:03.050
to make a larger protein.

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:05.900
So this is a
picture of catalase.

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:09.195
And you can see each of the
subunits of the catalase

00:06:09.195 --> 00:06:10.070
is a different color.

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:12.398
So catalase has four
different subunits.

00:06:12.398 --> 00:06:14.690
So these four subunits all
have their own secondary and

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:15.482
tertiary structure.

00:06:15.482 --> 00:06:16.530
They're identical.

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:19.100
And then they come together
to make the overall catalase

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:20.188
protein.

00:06:20.188 --> 00:06:21.980
Not all proteins have
quaternary structure.

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:25.790
Some just have normal folding
and secondary and tertiary

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:27.435
structure.

00:06:27.435 --> 00:06:29.810
And the quaternary structures
are typically held together

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:32.030
by dispersion forces
and hydrogen bonding

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:33.300
between the subunits.

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:35.948
So it's not usually a
covalent interaction,

00:06:35.948 --> 00:06:38.240
but it is strong enough to
hold these subunits together

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:41.650
into the correct shape for
the protein to function.

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:47.580
Another key piece
of protein structure

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:48.910
are prosthetic groups.

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:51.780
And these are groups that are
not made out of amino acids.

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:54.630
So they are not peptides,
but they are very

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:57.090
important for protein function.

00:06:57.090 --> 00:06:59.520
And some examples are
iron-sulfur clusters.

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:01.920
So these are some
3D representations

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:03.420
of what an iron-sulfur
cluster would

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:06.150
look like where your
iron centers are red,

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:08.640
and the sulfur are
these yellow balls.

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:10.980
So you can have different
numbers of irons and sulfurs

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:12.030
bonded together.

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:14.910
And these play key
roles in photosynthesis

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:16.420
and in metabolism.

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:19.250
So they're really good
at electron transport.

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:20.730
So, in the electron
transport chain

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:23.835
in your cellular metabolism
or in photosynthesis

00:07:23.835 --> 00:07:25.710
when you have to transport
electrons in order

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:30.030
to make energy, those
iron-sulfur clusters,

00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:33.310
that is where they are
typically found in nature.

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:35.230
And another really
common prosthetic group

00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:39.100
is the heme group, which you
may recognize from hemoglobin.

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:41.760
It is used in oxygen
binding and transport.

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:44.440
So it binds to the oxygen and
carries it through your blood.

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:48.610
And it can also be used in
oxygen reactions or oxygen

00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:51.490
activation, which is what we're
going to talk about today.

00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:53.140
Other types of
prosthetic groups,

00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:55.007
you can have lipids
or sugars that

00:07:55.007 --> 00:07:57.340
are bound to proteins that
help with protein recognition

00:07:57.340 --> 00:08:00.760
and things like that, but
metals and metals centers

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:05.063
are the most common
that are used.

00:08:05.063 --> 00:08:06.730
So, if we want to
talk a little bit more

00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:08.470
about the heme group is what
we're going to focus on,

00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:11.240
the heme group is based off
of this porphyrin structure.

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:13.060
And so this is a porphyrin.

00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:15.100
It is made up of
different pyrrole rings

00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:16.610
that are bridged together.

00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:18.730
And, if you look at
this shape, there's

00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:21.670
a nice hole in the center,
which is perfect for inserting

00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:23.350
a metal center.

00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:25.350
And pyrroles are found--
or porphyrins are found

00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:27.400
in many different contexts.

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:28.650
So you can find them in hemes.

00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:30.424
Obviously, we've
said that already.

00:08:30.424 --> 00:08:32.549
So, if you put an iron
center in the middle of that

00:08:32.549 --> 00:08:35.400
and you can add different
functional groups

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:38.309
to the outside of the pyrrole,
then you can make a heme.

00:08:38.309 --> 00:08:41.159
In chlorophyll, it
has a magnesium ion

00:08:41.159 --> 00:08:42.450
in the center of it.

00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:45.510
Enzymes have these
to hold a whole bunch

00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:48.900
of different metal centers
or even to not hold any metal

00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:55.610
centers, just the very
common organic group.

00:08:55.610 --> 00:08:58.880
The organic chemists
said, wow, these enzymes

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:00.883
use all of these
porphyrin groups,

00:09:00.883 --> 00:09:03.050
and it does some really
interesting redox chemistry.

00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:04.830
So we can make these in the lab.

00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:07.790
So they have made synthetic
versions of porphyrins

00:09:07.790 --> 00:09:10.670
with manganese,
iron, and cobalt that

00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:12.680
catalyze a bunch of
reactions in the lab,

00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:14.940
not necessarily in nature.

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:17.480
And they're also found
in petroleum complexed

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:18.665
with vanadium and nickel.

00:09:18.665 --> 00:09:21.290
And one of the ways that they're
used in the petroleum industry

00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:23.330
is to fingerprint petroleum.

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:27.230
So, by analyzing the
composition of the porphyrin

00:09:27.230 --> 00:09:30.020
complexes in the
petroleum, they can detect

00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:31.160
the source of oil spills.

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:33.890
They use it in geochemistry and
forensics and things like that.

00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:39.470
So now, if we look back
at our heme molecule,

00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:42.050
you can see that
all of the hemes

00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:44.800
contain this
porphyrin structure.

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:48.490
And then you can add different
groups around the outside,

00:09:48.490 --> 00:09:50.950
and that will change
the structure.

00:09:50.950 --> 00:09:53.550
And that will
change the function

00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:55.300
and change the way
that it is able to bind

00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:56.217
to different proteins.

00:09:56.217 --> 00:09:59.140
So some of the hemes are just
kind of stuck and held together

00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:01.140
with non-covalent interactions.

00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:04.000
And some hemes can actually be
covalently bound to proteins,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.353
depending on how they
are functionalized.

00:10:06.353 --> 00:10:08.770
And, like we said, they're
good for oxygen binding, oxygen

00:10:08.770 --> 00:10:13.013
transport, and
oxygen activation.

00:10:13.013 --> 00:10:14.930
And one of the interesting
things that I found

00:10:14.930 --> 00:10:18.543
was the role of hemes
in Impossible meat.

00:10:18.543 --> 00:10:20.210
So have you guys heard
of the Impossible

00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:22.502
meat or the Impossible Burgers,
the Impossible Whopper?

00:10:22.502 --> 00:10:24.200
Has anybody tried it?

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:24.950
Yeah?

00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:27.092
What are-- is it
actually like meat?

00:10:27.092 --> 00:10:27.800
What do we think?

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:28.733
Is it good?

00:10:28.733 --> 00:10:29.900
I haven't had it personally.

00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:30.560
AUDIENCE: It's pretty good.

00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:32.080
SARAH HEWETT: Pretty good.

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:32.740
Mixed reviews?

00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:34.712
Not so great?

00:10:34.712 --> 00:10:36.670
I haven't actually gotten
the chance to try it,

00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:40.120
but an interesting thing,
chemically speaking,

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:42.940
about the Impossible
meat is that, if you're

00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:45.490
going to have normal
hamburger from a cow,

00:10:45.490 --> 00:10:48.760
then one of the proteins that
is highly abundant in red meat

00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:49.985
is myoglobin.

00:10:49.985 --> 00:10:51.610
And this is the
structure of myoglobin.

00:10:51.610 --> 00:10:54.010
And you can see
that this group here

00:10:54.010 --> 00:10:59.050
that is not part of the
peptide arrangement is a heme.

00:10:59.050 --> 00:11:00.520
And that happens
to be what gives

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:02.000
red meat a lot of its flavor.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.820
So, when you cook it,
it releases the heme,

00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:08.400
and the iron center
provides a lot of flavor.

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:12.080
So what they did was they
found that, in soybean roots,

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:15.830
they have a protein called
leghemoglobin, which

00:11:15.830 --> 00:11:18.530
is very similar in
structure to myoglobin

00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:21.420
and also contains a heme center.

00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:25.320
And so, if they extract this
protein out of the soybean

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:28.590
plant roots, then they can
add it to the Impossible meat.

00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:30.870
And then you will have a
plant-based source of heme

00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:33.660
that will give you the
meaty, irony flavor that we

00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:35.820
have associated with red meat.

00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:39.150
So they take proteins from
soybeans and potatoes,

00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:41.820
like they make most
vegetarian protein options out

00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:45.520
of, and then add this
leghemoglobin from the soybean

00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:46.020
roots.

00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:47.370
And it is a red color.

00:11:47.370 --> 00:11:48.450
So it's also a colorant.

00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:53.250
The heme center is what gives
your blood its red color.

00:11:53.250 --> 00:11:58.440
So having those conjugated
pi systems in the porphyrin

00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:02.160
molecule and combined with
an iron-- or a metal center

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:03.660
will give you colors.

00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:06.360
And so it gives it the color
and the flavor of actual meat.

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:10.950
So that's an interesting
role of hemes outside

00:12:10.950 --> 00:12:13.780
of your blood or catalase.

00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:17.135
Going back to catalase, again,
this is the overall structure.

00:12:17.135 --> 00:12:19.010
And it is very hard to
see with these colors,

00:12:19.010 --> 00:12:21.470
but there are heme
centers-- you can see them--

00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:25.640
in each of the four
subunits of catalase.

00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:28.910
And it contains also a
binding site for NADPH.

00:12:28.910 --> 00:12:32.390
And this is the
structure of NADPH.

00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:38.660
And the NADPH's role is
to maintain the oxidation

00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:39.920
state of the iron center.

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:42.680
So it is pretty important
that the iron center maintains

00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:44.450
its iron 3 oxidation state.

00:12:44.450 --> 00:12:47.417
It goes between iron 3 and
iron 4 while it is active,

00:12:47.417 --> 00:12:49.250
but, in order for it
to start the chemistry,

00:12:49.250 --> 00:12:50.167
it needs to be iron 3.

00:12:50.167 --> 00:12:52.310
And so the NADPH
can donate electrons

00:12:52.310 --> 00:12:55.490
to make sure that the iron
is in its active form.

00:12:57.972 --> 00:12:59.680
Now, if we want to
take a moment and look

00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:04.570
at the actual mechanism for the
reaction of hydrogen peroxide

00:13:04.570 --> 00:13:10.060
with catalase, this is a
very pared down version

00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:12.080
of the catalase activation site.

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:14.943
So there is a
histidine residue here.

00:13:14.943 --> 00:13:16.610
You have your iron
center and your heme.

00:13:16.610 --> 00:13:19.270
And then, when hydrogen
peroxide comes in,

00:13:19.270 --> 00:13:22.750
the first step is
that those electrons

00:13:22.750 --> 00:13:27.430
can remove one of the hydrogens
from the hydrogen peroxide.

00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:31.740
And then this oxygen will
bind to your metal center.

00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:34.310
So then you have your histidine
now that is protonated.

00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:38.660
You have your oxygen bound
to your metal center.

00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:44.590
And then this oxygen
can take the hydrogen.

00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:48.550
And the iron center can
donate some electrons here

00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:55.930
to form water and an
iron-oxygen double bond.

00:13:55.930 --> 00:13:58.450
And now this is iron 4.

00:13:58.450 --> 00:14:00.233
So iron has donated
some electrons

00:14:00.233 --> 00:14:01.900
to this oxygen center,
and it's actually

00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:05.308
a radical and a cation.

00:14:05.308 --> 00:14:06.350
So that's the first step.

00:14:06.350 --> 00:14:07.990
And so that's where our
first hydrogen peroxide

00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:09.782
molecule comes in
because, if you remember,

00:14:09.782 --> 00:14:12.070
the overall reaction
that we're working with

00:14:12.070 --> 00:14:18.160
is two hydrogen peroxides goes
to two waters and one oxygen.

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:22.100
And then the second step
is, once you have this iron

00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:25.450
radical cation, there are
two proposed mechanisms

00:14:25.450 --> 00:14:27.130
for how this reaction can go.

00:14:27.130 --> 00:14:28.990
And it can either
be also mediated

00:14:28.990 --> 00:14:31.780
by this histidine residue
where one of the hydrogens

00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:33.320
ends up on the histidine.

00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:37.830
The other one adds to the oxygen
bound to the metal center.

00:14:37.830 --> 00:14:40.680
You release the oxygen, and
this hydrogen comes back in.

00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:42.240
And you form your water.

00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:45.330
Or you can kind of
ignore this histidine

00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:49.080
and do two hydrogen transfers
onto this oxygen bound

00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:50.550
to the iron.

00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:52.680
And then you make your
water and your oxygen.

00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:56.700
And they have done isotopic
labeling studies where

00:14:56.700 --> 00:14:59.160
you can make this
first complex and then

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:01.530
add in hydrogen peroxide
that's been labeled

00:15:01.530 --> 00:15:04.200
with oxygen-18 isotopes.

00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:07.830
And they have found that all
of the oxygen that is produced

00:15:07.830 --> 00:15:09.390
is oxygen-18.

00:15:09.390 --> 00:15:13.110
So they know that the oxygen
here comes from this peroxide.

00:15:13.110 --> 00:15:15.990
And then the oxygen that
is bound to the iron

00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:17.467
ends up in the water.

00:15:17.467 --> 00:15:19.800
So that's kind of how they
were able to narrow down some

00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:22.870
of the mechanisms for this.

00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:27.060
And, if you remember,
our reaction,

00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:30.820
our decomposition of hydrogen
peroxide can happen on its own.

00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:35.965
So here is a mechanism for how
it may happen without catalase.

00:15:35.965 --> 00:15:37.920
So you can compare.

00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:39.360
One of the proposed
mechanisms is

00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:40.980
that the hydrogen
peroxide breaks

00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:42.880
into two hydroxy radicals.

00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:47.222
Then the second molecule
of hydrogen peroxide

00:15:47.222 --> 00:15:48.930
reacts with one of
those hydroxy radicals

00:15:48.930 --> 00:15:53.590
to form one molecule of water
and this peroxy radical.

00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:56.500
And then you have
one of these and one

00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:57.560
of these that are formed.

00:15:57.560 --> 00:16:00.100
So those can react and
form your water and then

00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:03.790
your molecular oxygen. So
it takes a few more steps.

00:16:03.790 --> 00:16:06.650
It's a little bit
slower, but that

00:16:06.650 --> 00:16:09.720
is a comparison of how
the enzyme can catalyze

00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:11.850
this reaction to
happen much faster

00:16:11.850 --> 00:16:13.940
than what may happen in nature.

00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:21.460
So that is what is happening in
the decomposition of hydrogen

00:16:21.460 --> 00:16:24.490
peroxide, either just
hanging out on the bench top

00:16:24.490 --> 00:16:28.540
or with your catalase
catalyzation.

00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:31.360
And now we're going to talk
about our goals for day three

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:33.470
and four of catalase.

00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:35.030
So, after day one
and day two, you

00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:36.450
have seen this reaction happen.

00:16:36.450 --> 00:16:38.180
And now, for days
three and four,

00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:41.150
we are going to try to
quantify the amount of catalase

00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:42.992
in an unknown protein sample.

00:16:42.992 --> 00:16:45.200
And then we were going to
quantify the amount of iron

00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:46.940
that is present in
our sample of catalase

00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:49.148
and try to figure out how
many iron centers there are

00:16:49.148 --> 00:16:52.010
per one molecule of catalase.

00:16:52.010 --> 00:16:54.960
And, based on the work of
a lot of other scientists,

00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:57.110
we know that, theoretically,
it should be how many?

00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:04.589
We can go back.

00:17:08.290 --> 00:17:11.470
So there are how many
subunits in catalase?

00:17:11.470 --> 00:17:11.980
Four.

00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:14.310
How many hemes per subunit?

00:17:14.310 --> 00:17:14.810
One.

00:17:14.810 --> 00:17:18.025
So how many total iron
centers in a catalase protein?

00:17:18.025 --> 00:17:18.650
AUDIENCE: Four.

00:17:18.650 --> 00:17:20.688
SARAH HEWETT: Four, excellent.

00:17:20.688 --> 00:17:22.230
So we know that
there should be four.

00:17:22.230 --> 00:17:24.430
And hopefully-- that is
our theoretical value.

00:17:24.430 --> 00:17:27.060
Hopefully, you guys are
going to be able to get that

00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:29.170
as your answer in the lab.

00:17:29.170 --> 00:17:31.140
So how are we going to do that?

00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:33.990
First, we're going to talk
about how to quantify proteins.

00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:37.620
So it's important to be able to
determine the amount of protein

00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:39.480
in a given sample.

00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:43.480
In terms of for nutritional
studies, biochemical studies,

00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:46.305
you need to know how much
protein that you have.

00:17:46.305 --> 00:17:47.930
And there are a couple
of ways that you

00:17:47.930 --> 00:17:49.930
can determine the amount
of protein in a sample.

00:17:49.930 --> 00:17:52.340
You can do a
nonspecific assay, which

00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:55.350
will just tell you how much
overall protein that you have.

00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:58.760
It's not specific
to certain proteins.

00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:01.850
And some examples of those
are the biuret assay.

00:18:01.850 --> 00:18:03.510
You can use UV spectroscopy.

00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:07.850
So we did visible spectroscopy
with our phosphate samples

00:18:07.850 --> 00:18:09.560
in the Charles River lab.

00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:11.390
If you use
ultraviolet light, you

00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:14.740
can detect the amount of
protein that you have.

00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:20.880
So some of the amino acids have
the aromatic residues or the pi

00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:21.380
bonds.

00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:23.730
And those will absorb UV light.

00:18:23.730 --> 00:18:26.030
So you can quantify
proteins that way.

00:18:26.030 --> 00:18:28.130
Or you can do a
Bradford assay, which

00:18:28.130 --> 00:18:31.400
is more similar to
the assay that we

00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:34.760
did with our phosphate samples
in that it is a visible color

00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:37.390
change that you can see and
same with the biuret assay.

00:18:37.390 --> 00:18:39.140
And the Bradford assay
is actually the one

00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:40.610
that we're going to do in lab.

00:18:40.610 --> 00:18:42.420
So we'll talk about
that more in a second.

00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:44.930
And, if you want to
know specifically what--

00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:47.553
if you want to identify the
amount of one specific protein,

00:18:47.553 --> 00:18:49.970
you can do protein-specific
assays such as a Western blood

00:18:49.970 --> 00:18:51.350
or an ELISA.

00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:55.190
And those use antibodies to
select for specific proteins.

00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:57.800
And then you can either
attach a fluorescent tag

00:18:57.800 --> 00:19:00.320
to the protein or a
color-changing tag.

00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:04.130
So, when the antibody
matches up with your protein,

00:19:04.130 --> 00:19:07.370
you get a color change or some
light that you can quantify.

00:19:07.370 --> 00:19:11.090
And you can also do protein
mass spectrometry and look at--

00:19:11.090 --> 00:19:14.240
you can use that to quantify
the specific proteins also.

00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:19.043
So the Bradford
assay is the assay

00:19:19.043 --> 00:19:20.710
that we're going to
be doing in the lab.

00:19:20.710 --> 00:19:23.890
And the Bradford assay
uses Coomassie dye.

00:19:23.890 --> 00:19:28.840
And this is the structure
of Coomassie dye.

00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:31.390
And, if you just pour
the Coomassie dye out

00:19:31.390 --> 00:19:35.880
of the bottle, it is this
brownish sort of reddish color.

00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:40.860
And, when it reacts to
proteins, it turns blue.

00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:44.040
So you can quantify
the amount of blue.

00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:45.930
And that will tell
you how much protein

00:19:45.930 --> 00:19:47.430
you have in your sample.

00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:51.660
And the protein reacts with
these sulfonyl groups over here

00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:53.140
and causes the color change.

00:19:53.140 --> 00:19:56.310
So, when you have all of
these aromatic systems

00:19:56.310 --> 00:19:58.650
and electron-rich
groups when you

00:19:58.650 --> 00:20:01.570
change the electronic structure
by bonding to a protein,

00:20:01.570 --> 00:20:04.710
then you can change the color.

00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:07.490
So this is what we
are going to do.

00:20:07.490 --> 00:20:11.230
And, in order to quantify
the amount of blue or amount

00:20:11.230 --> 00:20:14.830
of protein that we have, similar
to our phosphate analysis

00:20:14.830 --> 00:20:16.900
before, we need to make
a series of standards.

00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:20.260
So you need to know
what your absorbance is

00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:22.290
at different
concentrations of the thing

00:20:22.290 --> 00:20:23.540
that you're trying to measure.

00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:24.998
So we made our
phosphate standards,

00:20:24.998 --> 00:20:27.280
and those also
happened to turn blue.

00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:29.530
And we are going to make a
series of protein standards

00:20:29.530 --> 00:20:32.350
so that we know what color
our Coomassie dye will

00:20:32.350 --> 00:20:35.170
turn a different
protein concentrations.

00:20:35.170 --> 00:20:39.190
To do this, we are going to
use bovine serum albumin.

00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:40.690
And it's a serum
albumin protein,

00:20:40.690 --> 00:20:42.370
which is found in blood.

00:20:42.370 --> 00:20:44.980
And bovine means that the one
that we're going to be using

00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:48.070
is coming from cows.

00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:51.700
And that's helpful because there
is a lot of cow blood left over

00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:53.410
from the meat industry.

00:20:53.410 --> 00:20:55.060
And it is found in
the blood plasma,

00:20:55.060 --> 00:20:57.440
and it maintains-- its
role in a living animal

00:20:57.440 --> 00:20:59.440
is to maintain the osmotic
pressure in the blood

00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:02.200
and carry biologically important
molecules through your blood

00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:04.570
plasma, but we are
going to use it

00:21:04.570 --> 00:21:08.200
as a primary standard for
our protein quantification.

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:11.680
And we can do this because it is
abundant, inexpensive, stable,

00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:13.180
and reacts well
with Coomassie dye.

00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:15.070
So we can get a nice
calibration curve.

00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:17.800
And it's also similar
enough to our protein,

00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:22.260
catalase, that we can use it
to make our standard curve.

00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:26.482
So typically you would try
to use the same molecule

00:21:26.482 --> 00:21:28.440
that you are quantifying
to make your standard,

00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:30.550
but that's not always possible.

00:21:30.550 --> 00:21:33.600
So, in that case,
it's helpful to have

00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:36.660
a protein that can kind
of stand in, is abundant,

00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:37.675
and easily quantifiable.

00:21:37.675 --> 00:21:39.300
So you can buy
different concentrations

00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:42.480
of this Bovine Serum
Albumin, or BSA,

00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:44.703
from a bunch of different
chemical suppliers.

00:21:44.703 --> 00:21:46.620
So you know what the
concentration is, and you

00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:50.130
can use that as your standard.

00:21:50.130 --> 00:21:52.590
The way that we are going
to do this in the lab

00:21:52.590 --> 00:21:55.710
is to prepare standards
very similarly to how

00:21:55.710 --> 00:21:58.500
you did for your phosphate.

00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:01.260
You will have your
BSA stock solution.

00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:04.980
And the BSA that we're going to
be using is in solution form.

00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:09.420
And the stock solution is 2,000
micrograms per milliliter.

00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:12.642
And you will be
diluting it with buffer.

00:22:12.642 --> 00:22:14.850
So again it's really important
to use buffer any time

00:22:14.850 --> 00:22:16.225
that you're working
with proteins

00:22:16.225 --> 00:22:18.810
because of the
different structures

00:22:18.810 --> 00:22:21.500
that we showed you before.

00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:24.630
The side chains
could be charged.

00:22:24.630 --> 00:22:27.710
And that will impact their
interactions with each other.

00:22:27.710 --> 00:22:29.810
So you want to make sure
that the pH is correct

00:22:29.810 --> 00:22:32.227
so that your protonation states
of all of your amino acids

00:22:32.227 --> 00:22:35.450
are what they should be in terms
of like a physiological pH.

00:22:35.450 --> 00:22:38.900
So you'll add-- dilute
your BSA with buffer.

00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:42.170
And then you will have a
bunch of different standards

00:22:42.170 --> 00:22:43.370
at varying concentrations.

00:22:43.370 --> 00:22:45.628
And then you'll have one
where you don't add any BSA,

00:22:45.628 --> 00:22:46.670
and it's just the buffer.

00:22:46.670 --> 00:22:48.305
And that will serve
as your blank.

00:22:52.515 --> 00:22:55.140
The way this is going to work in
lab is that you will pipette--

00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:56.880
you'll be using
little microcentrifuge

00:22:56.880 --> 00:22:58.800
tubes and the micropipetters.

00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:02.010
And so this is a very
quantitative experiment.

00:23:02.010 --> 00:23:04.775
So you need to get really
good with your micropipetting

00:23:04.775 --> 00:23:07.400
technique and make sure that you
don't contaminate your samples

00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:08.817
because you're
going to be working

00:23:08.817 --> 00:23:11.430
with very small quantities,
microliters of things.

00:23:11.430 --> 00:23:13.350
So you want to
make sure that you

00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:15.840
are changing your pipette
tips at an appropriate time

00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:20.440
and using the
pipettes accurately.

00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:22.997
So you will pipette
the standards

00:23:22.997 --> 00:23:24.330
into your microcentrifuge tubes.

00:23:24.330 --> 00:23:27.390
And then we will give
you a standard sample--

00:23:27.390 --> 00:23:29.280
or an unknown
sample of catalase.

00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:32.490
And then you will
put catalase in each

00:23:32.490 --> 00:23:33.900
of the microcentrifuge tubes.

00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:35.983
And we're going to do five
samples of the catalase

00:23:35.983 --> 00:23:37.710
so that we have five
unknowns that you

00:23:37.710 --> 00:23:42.650
can do an analysis of
your error on that,

00:23:42.650 --> 00:23:45.310
similar to the phosphate where
we ran five standards from--

00:23:45.310 --> 00:23:46.290
or five samples from the river.

00:23:46.290 --> 00:23:48.060
You guys saw how much
those can fluctuate

00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:50.160
depending on how you
prepared the samples

00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:52.380
or how well you pipetted.

00:23:52.380 --> 00:23:54.330
So it'll be the same thing.

00:23:54.330 --> 00:24:01.470
We will have multiples,
multiple trials.

00:24:01.470 --> 00:24:03.120
Then you will add
the Coomassie reagent

00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:05.860
to each of the standards
and your samples.

00:24:05.860 --> 00:24:08.350
And this is where it is going
to be very important that you

00:24:08.350 --> 00:24:11.242
pay attention to the
timing of this experiment.

00:24:11.242 --> 00:24:12.700
So you will add
your Coomassie dye.

00:24:12.700 --> 00:24:14.492
And then you will shake
it up a little bit.

00:24:14.492 --> 00:24:19.460
And then, as soon as you add
the dye, you will start a timer.

00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:22.265
And you will close the tubes,
shake them, allow the color

00:24:22.265 --> 00:24:23.390
to develop for two minutes.

00:24:23.390 --> 00:24:26.810
And then, at two minutes, you
will pour all of your samples

00:24:26.810 --> 00:24:29.360
into cuvettes.

00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:32.720
And, in this case, we will
be using the smaller cuvettes

00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:35.540
than what you guys used
for the last samples,

00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:38.210
but they go in the
same instrument.

00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:40.700
You will transfer your
samples to the cuvettes.

00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:44.720
And then you will measure the
absorbance at 595 nanometers.

00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:46.580
And the program on
the UV/Vis instruments

00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:49.410
are set up to go
to that wavelength

00:24:49.410 --> 00:24:51.240
when you click on it.

00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:53.490
You need to start running
your samples at 10 minutes.

00:24:53.490 --> 00:24:54.660
So this is why it's
really important.

00:24:54.660 --> 00:24:56.493
So, once you start
adding the Coomassie dye,

00:24:56.493 --> 00:24:59.115
you need to start a timer
because the dye is--

00:24:59.115 --> 00:25:00.740
it's important that
all of your samples

00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:05.317
incubate for the same amount of
time so that it's consistent.

00:25:05.317 --> 00:25:07.400
So you don't want to take
your time like adding it

00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:09.733
to the beginning samples so
that, by the time you add it

00:25:09.733 --> 00:25:12.680
to your unknowns, it's
been like five minutes.

00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:15.660
So you want to work
quickly and carefully.

00:25:15.660 --> 00:25:18.190
The dye is most sensitive around
10 minutes after addition.

00:25:18.190 --> 00:25:20.190
So that's when you will
get really good spectra.

00:25:20.190 --> 00:25:21.930
If you wait too
long, then you will

00:25:21.930 --> 00:25:26.160
see that the protein-dye complex
will start to precipitate out

00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:27.030
of your solution.

00:25:27.030 --> 00:25:31.578
And you'll get these black
chunks in your cuvettes.

00:25:31.578 --> 00:25:33.870
And that's when you know that
you can no longer measure

00:25:33.870 --> 00:25:37.590
the absorbance of your sample.

00:25:37.590 --> 00:25:40.043
So that'll be
careful, and we will

00:25:40.043 --> 00:25:41.960
try to stagger people
so that not everybody is

00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:45.562
using the UV/Vis at the same
time so that you have your--

00:25:45.562 --> 00:25:47.770
you can do everything in
the allotted amount of time.

00:25:50.563 --> 00:25:51.980
You will make a
calibration curve,

00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:53.910
and it will look
something like this.

00:25:53.910 --> 00:25:57.380
And, as you can see, it's
not the most linear thing.

00:25:57.380 --> 00:26:01.190
BSA has three
linear regions when

00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:03.230
you are doing a Bradford assay.

00:26:03.230 --> 00:26:07.228
And the first one is from 0 to
125 micrograms per milliliter.

00:26:07.228 --> 00:26:09.020
We don't really have
any data points there,

00:26:09.020 --> 00:26:11.480
and your protein concentration
in your catalase sample

00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:12.605
should be higher than that.

00:26:12.605 --> 00:26:14.820
So we're not really going
to look at that region.

00:26:14.820 --> 00:26:17.990
And then the other region
is in the middle here,

00:26:17.990 --> 00:26:23.750
either from 125 to 1,000
or 125 to 750 micrograms

00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:25.820
per milliliter.

00:26:25.820 --> 00:26:29.720
And, when you get your data,
you can look at this and graph

00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:32.060
both of these
regions to see which

00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:34.700
one gives you a more linear
and more steeper slope.

00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:38.510
And that's the one that
you can use to calculate

00:26:38.510 --> 00:26:40.020
your unknown samples with.

00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:42.650
And the third region is
above 1,000 micrograms

00:26:42.650 --> 00:26:44.150
per milliliter,
but, as you can see,

00:26:44.150 --> 00:26:47.550
you're getting above one
absorbance unit there.

00:26:47.550 --> 00:26:50.295
And so then it's not as
accurate beyond there.

00:26:50.295 --> 00:26:51.920
So we're not going
to worry about that.

00:26:54.093 --> 00:26:55.510
So, when you get
your data, you'll

00:26:55.510 --> 00:26:58.057
need to figure out where
it is most linear, where

00:26:58.057 --> 00:26:59.140
the slope is the steepest.

00:26:59.140 --> 00:27:00.890
And that is what you
will use to calculate

00:27:00.890 --> 00:27:02.994
your unknown concentrations.

00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:09.400
And then it is just like
you did for phosphate,

00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:11.900
and you'll be able to calculate
your unknown concentrations.

00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:14.480
Any questions about
the quantification

00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:19.330
of the amount of
catalase protein?

00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:24.730
So our calibration curve,
also one thing to note,

00:27:24.730 --> 00:27:26.740
is in units of micrograms
per milliliter.

00:27:26.740 --> 00:27:28.750
And you'll know how many
milliliters of solution

00:27:28.750 --> 00:27:29.470
that you added.

00:27:29.470 --> 00:27:31.810
And we know that the
molecular weight of catalase

00:27:31.810 --> 00:27:36.500
is 240 kilodaltons or
240,000 grams per mole.

00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:39.790
So you can figure out how
many moles of catalase protein

00:27:39.790 --> 00:27:43.570
you have from the concentration
and that conversion factor.

00:27:43.570 --> 00:27:46.150
So that's something to note.

00:27:46.150 --> 00:27:50.110
And then, once we have our
amount of catalase protein,

00:27:50.110 --> 00:27:53.740
we can determine the amount
of iron in the protein.

00:27:53.740 --> 00:27:57.740
So this is-- and we'll be doing
that using the ferrozine assay.

00:27:57.740 --> 00:28:00.910
This is the structure
of ferrozine.

00:28:00.910 --> 00:28:07.990
And the ferrozine molecule
by itself is colorless.

00:28:07.990 --> 00:28:10.150
And then, when you
complex it with iron,

00:28:10.150 --> 00:28:12.680
it turns into a magenta color.

00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:16.774
And there are three molecules
of ferrozine for every one iron

00:28:16.774 --> 00:28:18.106
ion.

00:28:18.106 --> 00:28:22.220
And so it forms in an
octahedral sort of geometry.

00:28:22.220 --> 00:28:24.070
So, if there are six
binding sites on iron,

00:28:24.070 --> 00:28:31.250
then you'll have one ferrozine
here, one there, and one there.

00:28:31.250 --> 00:28:35.630
And it bonds to these two
nitrogen centers here.

00:28:35.630 --> 00:28:37.460
And again, like
the Coomassie dye,

00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:41.030
there are a lot of pi electrons
and aromatic systems, which

00:28:41.030 --> 00:28:42.490
help to give it its color.

00:28:45.195 --> 00:28:46.570
So the way that
we're going to do

00:28:46.570 --> 00:28:50.888
this is we will be using
again UV/Vis spectroscopy

00:28:50.888 --> 00:28:53.430
because we have something that
goes from colorless to colored

00:28:53.430 --> 00:28:55.590
when it interacts with
our molecule of interest

00:28:55.590 --> 00:28:57.250
or our ion of interest.

00:28:57.250 --> 00:28:58.868
So the first step
in this procedure

00:28:58.868 --> 00:29:00.660
is going to be adding
methanesulfonic acid.

00:29:00.660 --> 00:29:03.780
And then you will heat it at
104 degrees for 40 minutes.

00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:09.100
And it's very important that
you keep the temperature range

00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:10.425
around 104 degrees.

00:29:10.425 --> 00:29:11.800
And you don't want
to go too high

00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:15.160
because we'll be heating them
in the microcentrifuge tubes.

00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:17.650
And, if you heat it too hot,
then your centrifuge tube

00:29:17.650 --> 00:29:19.480
can boil over, or it
can build up pressure,

00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:20.522
and the cap will pop off.

00:29:20.522 --> 00:29:23.050
And you'll lose all
of your solution.

00:29:23.050 --> 00:29:24.550
So you need to be
careful with that.

00:29:24.550 --> 00:29:27.880
And the purpose of this
step is to release the iron

00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:28.955
from the heme group.

00:29:28.955 --> 00:29:31.330
So, when you add a bunch of
acid, the iron gets released.

00:29:31.330 --> 00:29:32.913
And then we can
quantify it because it

00:29:32.913 --> 00:29:35.910
won't be bound to our heme.

00:29:35.910 --> 00:29:38.160
Then we will add
sodium hydroxide

00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:40.880
to neutralize the acid.

00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:44.450
And then you're going to get a
ferrozine complex mixture that

00:29:44.450 --> 00:29:46.468
will be prepared by your TAs.

00:29:46.468 --> 00:29:48.260
And you will add it to
all of your samples.

00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:51.200
And the mixture
is ascorbic acid,

00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:56.360
which reduces the iron 3 to iron
2+ because that is what will

00:29:56.360 --> 00:29:59.300
complex with our
ferrozine molecule.

00:29:59.300 --> 00:30:02.810
Ammonium acetate helps
to buffer the pH.

00:30:02.810 --> 00:30:06.120
Neocuproine binds to any copper
ions that are in the solution.

00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:11.992
So the ferrozine ligand is not
necessarily specific to iron.

00:30:11.992 --> 00:30:13.700
So, if there are any
copper contaminants,

00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:16.010
then it will also
bind to copper,

00:30:16.010 --> 00:30:19.410
but the neocuproine is
more specific for copper.

00:30:19.410 --> 00:30:21.800
So it will bind
to the copper ions

00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:24.752
and make sure that it does
not contaminate your assay.

00:30:24.752 --> 00:30:26.210
And then, of course,
the ferrozine,

00:30:26.210 --> 00:30:28.293
that binds to the iron to
make the colored complex

00:30:28.293 --> 00:30:29.510
that we are going to measure.

00:30:32.190 --> 00:30:36.632
And then the-- so the
measurement of the ferrozine

00:30:36.632 --> 00:30:38.090
is going to be
pretty much the same

00:30:38.090 --> 00:30:39.357
as the BSA and the phosphate.

00:30:39.357 --> 00:30:40.940
Similar to UV/Vis,
you'll make a bunch

00:30:40.940 --> 00:30:43.670
of standards of iron sulfate.

00:30:43.670 --> 00:30:47.140
And then you will have
your catalase samples

00:30:47.140 --> 00:30:48.340
that have iron in them.

00:30:48.340 --> 00:30:50.610
And then you will make
your standard curve.

00:30:50.610 --> 00:30:52.120
The ferrozine is linear.

00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:54.670
So you'll be able to make your
standard curve, just graph it,

00:30:54.670 --> 00:30:56.553
and use the line.

00:30:56.553 --> 00:30:58.970
And then you will be able to
use the equation of your line

00:30:58.970 --> 00:31:02.930
to determine your concentration
of your unknown samples

00:31:02.930 --> 00:31:05.110
from your catalase.

00:31:05.110 --> 00:31:08.710
The data analysis
for this lab is

00:31:08.710 --> 00:31:10.810
going to be using the
protein assay results

00:31:10.810 --> 00:31:11.960
and the iron assay results.

00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:16.240
You will determine the number
of iron centers per catalase.

00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:19.270
And so you have the
micrograms per milliliter

00:31:19.270 --> 00:31:21.470
of your catalase protein.

00:31:21.470 --> 00:31:24.370
So you can convert that
using your molecular weight

00:31:24.370 --> 00:31:26.620
to moles of catalase.

00:31:26.620 --> 00:31:28.720
And then you will
also get your iron

00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:30.430
in micrograms per milliliter.

00:31:30.430 --> 00:31:32.440
And, using the molecular
weight of iron,

00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:34.060
you can convert that
to moles and then

00:31:34.060 --> 00:31:36.550
do a mole-to-mole ratio
of iron to catalase.

00:31:36.550 --> 00:31:39.660
And hopefully your answer
is somewhere around four

00:31:39.660 --> 00:31:41.800
if all goes well.

00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:43.300
So, in your discussion,
you can talk

00:31:43.300 --> 00:31:45.010
about sources of
error, how close you

00:31:45.010 --> 00:31:47.710
were to the theoretical
value of four,

00:31:47.710 --> 00:31:49.780
any discrepancies between
your calculated ratio,

00:31:49.780 --> 00:31:50.805
the expected ratio.

00:31:50.805 --> 00:31:52.930
And then you'll do an error
analysis of the protein

00:31:52.930 --> 00:31:54.050
and iron concentrations.

00:31:54.050 --> 00:31:56.290
So you will run
five unknown samples

00:31:56.290 --> 00:32:00.680
of catalase and five samples
with the ferrozine assay

00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:01.180
of iron.

00:32:01.180 --> 00:32:04.370
So you'll have five measurements
that should be the same.

00:32:04.370 --> 00:32:06.275
So those you can
do your average,

00:32:06.275 --> 00:32:08.150
your standard deviation,
confidence interval.

00:32:08.150 --> 00:32:09.310
And then, if you
have any outliers,

00:32:09.310 --> 00:32:11.477
that's when you can use the
Q test for the outliers.

00:32:13.522 --> 00:32:14.980
And there was a
couple of questions

00:32:14.980 --> 00:32:18.100
that came up during the
Charles River lab report.

00:32:18.100 --> 00:32:19.900
When we were making
the standard curves

00:32:19.900 --> 00:32:21.970
for the phosphate
determination, people

00:32:21.970 --> 00:32:24.430
had some outliers in
their standard curves.

00:32:24.430 --> 00:32:25.847
And they were
trying to figure out

00:32:25.847 --> 00:32:29.040
how they could get rid of
those or if they should.

00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:31.880
And the Q test only works if
you're measuring the same thing

00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:32.693
multiple times.

00:32:32.693 --> 00:32:34.610
So that does not work
for getting outliers out

00:32:34.610 --> 00:32:37.980
of a standard linear curve.

00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:40.640
But if you have-- in
your standard curve,

00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:42.860
if you have one sample
that is supposed

00:32:42.860 --> 00:32:44.630
to be a higher
concentration than the one

00:32:44.630 --> 00:32:47.930
before it and it has a lower
absorbance or something wildly

00:32:47.930 --> 00:32:51.383
higher, then you can look at
it and say I know for a fact

00:32:51.383 --> 00:32:53.300
that, if something has
a higher concentration,

00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:54.920
it should have a
higher absorbance.

00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:56.690
I can get rid of this point.

00:32:56.690 --> 00:33:00.290
You can also just kind
of by looking at it--

00:33:00.290 --> 00:33:01.760
that's not as
scientific, but you

00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:05.540
can make an argument for why you
would remove a data point based

00:33:05.540 --> 00:33:10.460
on how it looks compared
to the line of best fit.

00:33:10.460 --> 00:33:14.180
And you can also compare the
R squared values of the line

00:33:14.180 --> 00:33:15.930
with the point and
without the data point.

00:33:15.930 --> 00:33:17.888
And, if it gets closer
to 1 when you remove it,

00:33:17.888 --> 00:33:19.370
then it is more linear.

00:33:19.370 --> 00:33:22.010
You obviously don't want to
be taking out data points left

00:33:22.010 --> 00:33:24.093
and right until you only
have like your three best

00:33:24.093 --> 00:33:25.910
points that give you
a super straight line.

00:33:25.910 --> 00:33:29.423
But, if there are any that are
very obviously not on the line,

00:33:29.423 --> 00:33:31.340
then that is one way
that you can remove them.

00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:39.700
So yeah, are there any
questions about catalase

00:33:39.700 --> 00:33:42.580
or any of the other labs?

00:33:42.580 --> 00:33:43.292
Anything?

00:33:43.292 --> 00:33:44.500
This is all I have for today.

00:33:44.500 --> 00:33:45.708
This was kind of a short one.

00:33:50.725 --> 00:33:51.225
No.

00:33:54.250 --> 00:33:58.590
All right, then those of
you who are going to lab,

00:33:58.590 --> 00:33:59.570
you can head up there.

00:33:59.570 --> 00:34:02.700
And don't forget to
turn your reports in.

00:34:02.700 --> 00:34:05.300
And yeah, the
clipboard is around.

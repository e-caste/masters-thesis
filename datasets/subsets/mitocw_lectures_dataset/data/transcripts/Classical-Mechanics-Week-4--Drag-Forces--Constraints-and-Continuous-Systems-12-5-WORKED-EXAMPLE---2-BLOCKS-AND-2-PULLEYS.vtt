00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:06.110
We want to look at
this pulley system.

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:09.170
We want to find out
what this force here

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:12.880
is, for example, with which
this block is being pulled.

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:17.350
Now we have two massless pulleys
here and two moving parts.

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:20.510
And one key component
of this problem

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:23.970
is to derive the
acceleration constraint.

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.690
How are we going to do that?

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:29.730
Well, we have to look
at this string here.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.930
First of all, it's a
fixed string length.

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:34.470
And that will help us.

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:36.990
Ultimately, this is
just a distance that

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:39.820
connects all of these objects.

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.950
And if we eventually
differentiate that twice,

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:44.810
we get to an acceleration.

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:46.480
So the first thing
we're going to do

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:52.610
is to figure out what the
string length is to then derive

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:54.620
the acceleration condition.

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.630
Let's begin by first
identifying the fixed

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:59.430
length in this problem.

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.950
So we have a little
distance here.

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:06.030
We call it sb.

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:12.920
And we have a distance
here that's fixed, sa.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.380
And we furthermore know
that this block here

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.380
is fixed to the ground.

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.700
And we can choose a
coordinate system origin.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.750
Let's say we do that here.

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:31.720
We know that we have
the distance d here

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.750
to this little block.

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.870
The moving parts,
block 1 and block 2--

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:40.160
so we have to assign
position functions.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:46.440
And actually this
one here is x1.

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.491
It goes up to here
because we want

00:01:49.491 --> 00:01:51.200
to measure the string
length, ultimately,

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.180
and we know this portion here.

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:54.560
So we can subtract it.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:04.750
And then of course we need also
x1, so that goes here-- x2.

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.490
So now we can tally
up the length.

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:12.050
Let's start with
this portion here.

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:18.186
That is d minus sa minus x2.

00:02:18.186 --> 00:02:21.795
d minus sa minus x2.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.040
And then we have a
half circle here, pi r.

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.130
And we know actually that there
is another half circle that's

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.840
going to come there, so we can
just write 2 pi r immediately.

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.329
And then we have this part here.

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:48.730
That one is x1 minus sb,
and then minus sa minus x2.

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.100
And then finally we
have this portion,

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:06.685
and that is x1
minus sb minus x2.

00:03:10.878 --> 00:03:12.930
OK, so the next
step is that we need

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.540
to simplify this a little bit.

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:27.400
So we have one x1 and another
one here, 2x1 plus x2, x2,

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.643
x2-- actually 3-- minus 3x2.

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.260
And then we have all
sorts of consonants.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.990
We have d, we have
sa, sb, the 2 pi r.

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:44.780
But, as you will see, if we
differentiate this out here,

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.260
that will actually
all fall away.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.790
So we're going to make
our life easy and just

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.920
add a constant here.

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:59.160
And so we want to now do
the second derivative here

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.960
of our string length
with respect to time,

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:05.060
because these all
position functions.

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.730
So we can differentiate those.

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:10.640
What's important of course
here is this string length

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.570
is not changing with time.

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:16.410
So actually we know that
that derivative will be 0.

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.410
And we can just
write this up here

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:21.440
because x differentiated
twice is a.

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:27.070
So 2a1 minus 3a2.

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:36.170
And we immediately see from
that that a1 equals 3/2 a2.

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:42.010
So this is our
constraint condition

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:44.820
that we will need later.

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:49.610
For now, we need to continue
with setting up free body

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:53.820
diagrams of all four objects.

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:58.950
Let's start that with object 1.

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:01.140
What's acting on object 1?

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:04.745
Well, we have F here.

00:05:04.745 --> 00:05:08.380
Why don't we just
write it as magnitude.

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:12.740
We have F, and then
we have here a tension

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:16.640
that goes to the
pulley B. That one

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:18.780
is different from the
tension in the string.

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:21.675
So we're going to call this TB.

00:05:21.675 --> 00:05:25.520
And then we have object 2.

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:29.560
Oh, and of course, i hat
goes in this direction

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:32.840
because it follows the
motion of the object.

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:36.000
We have here kind
of the reverse.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.860
Now we have a tension
of this string here

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:42.239
that's attached to
pulley A, but it's

00:05:42.239 --> 00:05:44.030
different from this
string tension-- that's

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:46.340
a specific one-- TA.

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:51.510
And we also have a T
from the string here.

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:58.480
So we'll add a T. And then
if we look at pulley A,

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:04.360
we have two string
tensions, T and T.

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:08.830
And here we again have a TA.

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:21.020
And pulley B, TB,
and two T over here.

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:24.460
So that means we can write
down our equations of motions

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:28.190
using Newton's Second
Law, F equals ma.

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:35.800
And since this is just going
in the i hat direction,

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:39.000
we can just write down the four
equations following the four

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.870
free body diagrams here.

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:48.470
So we have F minus
TB equals m1 a1.

00:06:53.340 --> 00:07:06.820
We have T plus TA equals m2 a2.

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:14.280
Then we have 2T
minus TA equals 0.

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:18.560
That is 0 because we're dealing
with two massless pulleys

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:19.160
there.

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:24.510
That means m is 0 and so
our acceleration term is 0.

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:26.880
So the m is 0 here.

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:31.518
And finally, we
have TB minus 2T.

00:07:31.518 --> 00:07:35.409
No, not 2 pi-- 2T.

00:07:35.409 --> 00:07:39.760
And that one is also 0 because
it is a massless pulley.

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:43.720
So here we have our
four equations of motion

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:47.930
that fully govern
this pulley system.

00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:50.780
And we can use it
then, for example,

00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:53.930
to find this pulling force here.

00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:58.830
We know what TB is from the
equation down here-- so 2T.

00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:00.410
We know what TA is.

00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:03.090
It's also 2T.

00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:06.570
And we can then
solve this for F.

00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:12.720
The only sticky part is that
we have this a1 and a2 in here.

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:17.350
But for that, we derived this
constraint condition here.

00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:21.470
So with that one, we
can fully solve this.

00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:25.030
Otherwise, we would have
one too many unknowns.

00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:27.850
Alternatively, if one were
to be interested in one

00:08:27.850 --> 00:08:33.169
of these accelerations,
then this equation system

00:08:33.169 --> 00:08:37.419
can also be solved for a1 or a2.

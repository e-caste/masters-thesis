00:00:15.773 --> 00:00:17.440
SARAH HEWETT: All
right, good afternoon.

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:18.815
We should get
started, because we

00:00:18.815 --> 00:00:21.360
have a lot to talk about today.

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.490
So today is the second in
a series of three lectures

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:26.900
about the essential oil lab.

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.810
You'll get a third
lecture and a little bit

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:31.100
about X-ray crystallography.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:32.767
But today, we're going
to finish talking

00:00:32.767 --> 00:00:35.000
about the main synthetic
parts that you'll be

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.825
doing in the essential oil lab.

00:00:36.825 --> 00:00:38.450
So today, we're going
to talk about how

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:40.280
if your separation worked.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.080
And before I get
too far into that,

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.600
there was a question
in the Tuesday lecture

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.940
about the naming of terpenes.

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:48.470
And so if you
remember, the terpenes

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:50.150
come from the
isoprene structure,

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:52.070
which was five carbons
and eight hydrogens.

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:57.150
But then there are some
terpene derivatives,

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:59.190
like menthol, that
don't necessarily

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.800
have that five carbon,
eight hydrogen structure.

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.850
So this obviously has an O-H
group and more hydrogens.

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.490
And so what I found
in the literature

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.890
is that there are
terpenes, which

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.010
follow the strict pattern.

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:13.170
And then there are
terpenoids, which

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.397
are derivatives of terpenes.

00:01:14.397 --> 00:01:16.230
They are synthesized
from the same backbone.

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:19.680
But then they get extra
hydrogenation or oxidation

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:20.380
done to them.

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.820
So, like, your carvone has
the oxygen double bond in it.

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.937
So that's technically
a terpenoid.

00:01:25.937 --> 00:01:28.020
They seem to be referred
to pretty interchangeably

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.640
in the literature, which
I thought was interesting.

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.890
But that is probably
the more accurate way

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.550
to name these
types of compounds.

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:37.270
So hopefully, that clears up a
little bit of that confusion.

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.105
So jumping in to the rest of the
essential oil lab, on Tuesday,

00:01:41.105 --> 00:01:42.480
we talked about
what you're going

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.070
to do on day one
of the lab, which

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.470
is you'll get your essential
oil, which will either

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.820
be spearmint oil or caraway
oil, and you will separate it

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.320
into its two major components,
which are your carvone, there

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.640
on the left, and your limonene.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.190
So essentially, you'll take
an oil that looks like that,

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:58.710
and you'll separate it into
two other oils that will also

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.330
look really similar
to that first one,

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.123
except hopefully,
they're pure compounds.

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:09.408
So if you do your vacuum
distillation really well,

00:02:09.408 --> 00:02:11.700
and you separate those, and
you get two pure compounds,

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.630
we need to figure out how to
characterize your separation,

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.200
and figure out how well you were
able to separate your carvone

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.202
from your limonene.

00:02:19.202 --> 00:02:21.410
And we're going to do that
in a whole number of ways.

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.990
You'll get a lot of experience
with different analytical

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.690
techniques.

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.630
And these are the major
methods that we're

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.520
going to be using
to characterize

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.290
the success of your separation.

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.870
So we'll be doing refractometry,
gas chromatography,

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.700
infrared spectroscopy,
polarimetry,

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:35.960
and X-ray crystallography.

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:37.340
And so today,
we're going to talk

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:38.930
about the first four of those.

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.742
And then, like I said,
in a week or two,

00:02:41.742 --> 00:02:43.700
Peter Muller from the
X-ray crystallography lab

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.503
will come and do a much more
detailed explanation of X-ray

00:02:46.503 --> 00:02:48.170
crystallography and
what information you

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.780
can get from that.

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.080
So to start with,
refractometry--

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.110
refractometry is a way to
measure the refractive index

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:58.580
of a compound.

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:02.420
And that is a
characteristic property

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.250
of different compounds.

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.970
And it is-- it comes from the
ratio of the velocity of light

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:09.960
and air to the velocity
of light in a liquid.

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.002
So you have your light
traveling through the air.

00:03:12.002 --> 00:03:13.880
Then it hits the liquid
and it slows down,

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.350
and it changes the angle.

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:17.930
So you'll notice, if you
ever look through some water,

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.240
you'll know that the image
is slightly distorted.

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:24.530
And that is because of water
having a different refractive

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.020
index, or water having--

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:30.330
the light slows down as it
travels through the water.

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.880
So all of our organic
liquids-- so like I said,

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.338
you're going to be separating
your oil into two other oils.

00:03:35.338 --> 00:03:37.588
So we'll have liquids, which
means that they will have

00:03:37.588 --> 00:03:38.750
refractive indices as well.

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:40.970
And most organic liquids
will have a refractive index

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.160
somewhere from 1.3 to 1.7.

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.030
And the way that you calculate
that is it's represented as n.

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.250
And you can either do
the ratio of the velocity

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:50.600
of the light in the
air to the velocity

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:51.290
of the light in the liquid.

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:52.650
But that is hard to measure.

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.030
So in the lab, we can
measure the angles

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:57.290
at which the light travels.

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.780
So if you have light that
is coming through the air--

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.120
so if this part is the air,
and you have your light,

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.670
it'll hit your liquid
interface at a certain angle,

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:08.030
which is theta from
straight up and down.

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:12.080
And then, it'll get refracted
at a different angle.

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.220
We call that theta prime.

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.250
So you can measure
that in the lab

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:20.180
and calculate your
refractive index.

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.970
The refractive index is
dependent on the wavelength

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:23.490
of light.

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.240
So you might imagine that
if the refractive index

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.550
and how much this angle--

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:30.350
and how much the speed
of the light changes

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:33.680
is dependent on how the light
interacts with your liquid,

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.170
then it'll depend on the
properties of your light-- so

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:38.300
the wavelength-- and the
properties of your liquid.

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.430
And one that we care
about is the density.

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:43.430
So the way that we
account for this

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:46.550
is that we have the
refractive index.

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:48.710
And we call it
refractive index D20.

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:54.470
And so D represents that you use
light from the sodium D line.

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:57.080
So if you remember from,
maybe, gen chem or physics,

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:02.240
if you heat up an element
very hot so it emits light,

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:03.240
you can--

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:04.910
each element has a
characteristic set

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:06.710
of wavelengths of
light that it emits.

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:08.840
And sodium's happens
to be around--

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:12.860
its brightest emission happens
to be around 586 nanometers.

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:16.670
So if you use a sodium lamp,
and you can select for these 586

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:19.912
nanometers, then you get a
characteristic one wavelength

00:05:19.912 --> 00:05:21.870
of light that you can
pass through your sample.

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:23.328
So you know what
the wavelength is,

00:05:23.328 --> 00:05:25.700
and you can know that
you're just getting

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:27.443
that one wavelength of light.

00:05:27.443 --> 00:05:29.860
And then, you want to make
sure that all of your samples--

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:32.650
or your measurements are taken
at 20 degrees Celsius so that

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:34.755
the density of your liquid.

00:05:34.755 --> 00:05:36.130
So if you change
the temperature,

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:37.120
you change the density.

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.620
So we'd make all
of our measurements

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:40.810
at 20 degrees Celsius.

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:44.530
And here are the approximate
refractive indices

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:46.020
of limonene and carvone.

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:47.770
And you can find
different values for them

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:52.150
in the literature, because
the compounds that they

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:54.157
used to measure these
in the literature

00:05:54.157 --> 00:05:55.240
are of different purities.

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:58.250
So you can by limonene and
carvone at 95%, or 96%,

00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:59.080
98% purity.

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:00.857
And depending on
what purity you use,

00:06:00.857 --> 00:06:02.440
you'll get a slightly
different value.

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:04.010
But they should be
within that range.

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:05.510
And when we measure
them in the lab,

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:07.888
we go out to four
decimal places.

00:06:07.888 --> 00:06:09.430
The way that we'll
do this in the lab

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:10.630
is with the refractometer.

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:13.360
And this is a picture of the
refractometer in the lab.

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:17.500
And this part over here is
the prism or the crystal.

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:19.120
And so you'll put
your liquid sample--

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:21.760
you just put a few drops
right on the crystal.

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:26.895
And then, you close the lid and
the refractometer instrument

00:06:26.895 --> 00:06:28.270
shines light
through your sample.

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:30.340
It can measure-- it knows
what angle the light is

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:31.257
hitting the sample at.

00:06:31.257 --> 00:06:34.810
And then it can measure how
much light it gets back out.

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:37.330
So it'll change the angle
of the incident light

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:39.640
until it gets total internal
reflectance until it

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:41.020
reaches the critical angle.

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:42.400
You remember from physics?

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.650
And so once it figures out
what the critical angle is,

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:47.620
then it can figure out
the refractive index

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:48.967
of your sample.

00:06:48.967 --> 00:06:51.550
And so it'll tell you what the
refractive index is right here.

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:53.560
You don't even really
have to do any math.

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:55.630
And it'll also tell you
what the temperature is.

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:57.460
So you want to make sure that
it's stabilized at 20 degrees

00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:59.210
before you actually
take your measurement.

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:00.920
And that's about it.

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:02.810
So it's a pretty easy
measurement to take,

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:07.180
but it will help you to identify
the purity of your compounds,

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:09.850
because the
refractive index is--

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:12.220
we can think of it as a
linear quantity made up

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:16.330
of the refractive indices
of the two substances

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:18.970
that we have in our mixture,
multiplied by their molar

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:20.540
fraction.

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:23.500
So your refractive
index of a mixture

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:26.080
is the sum of the
refractive index

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:29.500
of pure limonene times your
mole fraction of your limonene,

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:33.250
plus your refractive index of
your carvone times your molar

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:34.690
fraction of your carvone.

00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:37.370
And so that you don't have to
sell for a million variables,

00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:39.440
if you remember
the mole fraction,

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:41.260
mole fractions have
to add up to 1.

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.240
So your mole
fraction of limonene

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:45.510
is 1 minus your mole
fraction of carvone.

00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:48.285
So you can plug that in up there
and, using the measurements

00:07:48.285 --> 00:07:49.660
that you take in
the lab, you can

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:51.550
solve for the mole
fractions of each

00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:54.763
of these components in
both of your fractions

00:07:54.763 --> 00:07:56.430
that you collect from
your distillation.

00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:58.263
And you can determine
their purity that way.

00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:06.840
So another way to determine the
purity of your-- or fractions

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:09.370
that you've collected is
through gas chromatography.

00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:13.500
And this is a picture of the
GC instrument in the lab.

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:16.020
And it's right next to the
ICPMS, so you may have seen it

00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:17.640
if you were in lab yesterday.

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:20.500
And if not, you can take
a peek and see it today.

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:23.030
So this is the
instrument itself.

00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:24.030
This is the autosampler.

00:08:24.030 --> 00:08:25.697
So you guys will make
your sample vials,

00:08:25.697 --> 00:08:28.380
put them in up here, and then
it'll pick them up, put them

00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:30.422
into the instrument, and
then it'll automatically

00:08:30.422 --> 00:08:32.500
inject the sample for you,
which is kind of nice.

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:35.070
And then this
thing over here, it

00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:36.990
generates hydrogen
and air, which

00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:39.740
are used in the detector
of the instrument.

00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:42.275
So the way that
gas chromatography

00:08:42.275 --> 00:08:44.650
works, if you wanted to take
a peek inside the instrument

00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:47.020
in a very, very
simplified fashion,

00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:50.260
you have a carrier gas,
which in our case is helium.

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.660
And the carrier gas,
if you think about-- so

00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:54.250
this is a type of
chromatography.

00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:56.440
And you guys did chromatography
in the ferrocene lab

00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:58.720
with your thin layer
chromatography and your column

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:00.080
chromatography.

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:02.170
So in your TLC and in your
column chromatography,

00:09:02.170 --> 00:09:03.462
what was your stationary phase?

00:09:06.950 --> 00:09:07.700
AUDIENCE: Alumina?

00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:08.900
SARAH HEWETT: Alumina, yes.

00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:10.970
So you had your alumina, and
it was coated on the TLC plate.

00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:12.560
Or you packed your
column with the alumina,

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:13.970
and that's your
stationery phase.

00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:15.980
And then, what was
your mobile phase?

00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:17.480
AUDIENCE: Hexanes
and ethyl acetate?

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:18.570
SARAH HEWETT: Hexanes
and ethyl acetate.

00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:20.445
And you guys made
different mixtures of those

00:09:20.445 --> 00:09:23.870
to determine the best
separation of your compound.

00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:28.140
So in thin layer chromatography
and in column chromatography,

00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:31.490
which of those phases had
a bigger determination

00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:33.830
on the separation of
your two components?

00:09:33.830 --> 00:09:35.060
AUDIENCE: The mobile phase?

00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:35.840
SARAH HEWETT: The
mobile phase, yeah.

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:37.465
So you could change
the polarity and it

00:09:37.465 --> 00:09:39.450
would change the separation.

00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:42.400
In gas chromatography,
it's kind of the opposite.

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:43.770
So you have your carry your gas.

00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:45.478
And that's going to
be your mobile phase.

00:09:45.478 --> 00:09:48.540
So that'll help push your
compounds through the column.

00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:50.890
And then the column is
your stationary phase.

00:09:50.890 --> 00:09:53.190
And you can change
the properties

00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:55.680
of your stationary phase
in order to separate--

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:58.890
get different types
of separation.

00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:03.330
So there are two major
types of compounds that they

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:06.270
use in column chromatography.

00:10:06.270 --> 00:10:09.300
And the first one, this is--
anyone know what this is?

00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:21.242
Polyethylene glycol,
which is something

00:10:21.242 --> 00:10:22.450
you may have heard of before.

00:10:22.450 --> 00:10:24.990
So these are your ethyl
groups, and then the glycol,

00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:26.770
because it's got alcohol groups.

00:10:26.770 --> 00:10:30.990
And so this notation is
the notation for a polymer.

00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:32.670
So the way that
this is written is

00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:35.460
you could have any number
of this repeating unit

00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:38.130
until the end.

00:10:38.130 --> 00:10:40.390
And this is a polar
stationary phase.

00:10:40.390 --> 00:10:42.810
So if you're trying to
separate compounds that

00:10:42.810 --> 00:10:44.940
have differences-- large
differences in polarity,

00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:47.190
a lot of times you'll
use the polar compound.

00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:50.593
Because it has these oxygens
that have their lone pairs.

00:10:50.593 --> 00:10:52.260
So it can interact
with polar compounds,

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:55.140
it can form hydrogen bonds,
all kinds of neat stuff.

00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:58.050
But the one that we're
going to use in the lab

00:10:58.050 --> 00:11:00.570
is this compound here.

00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:02.460
And it is called a polysiloxane.

00:11:09.730 --> 00:11:13.130
So polysiloxane-- and it has
these silicon groups that

00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:14.540
have to methyl groups attached.

00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:18.470
And another name for this
particular-- so polysiloxane

00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:22.353
is the overarching name for
this class of compounds.

00:11:22.353 --> 00:11:24.020
This one has two
methyl groups attached.

00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:27.650
So one of the other names
for it is dimethicone.

00:11:27.650 --> 00:11:29.720
I don't know if you've
heard of that before.

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:31.280
It's in a lot of things.

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:34.430
They use it extensively
in lotions, shampoos,

00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:35.585
and sometimes in food.

00:11:35.585 --> 00:11:38.210
It prevents foaming and it makes
things feel nice and slippery.

00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:44.840
So that's why they use it in a
lot of cosmetics, and lotions,

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:45.540
and everything.

00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:47.690
So the next time
you're in the bathroom,

00:11:47.690 --> 00:11:49.565
you can take a look at
some of your products.

00:11:49.565 --> 00:11:51.545
And you may see dimethicone.

00:11:56.780 --> 00:11:58.590
And now you know
what it looks like.

00:11:58.590 --> 00:12:00.140
And we're going to
use it in the lab

00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:02.660
to help separate your
limonene and your carvone

00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:06.530
to see how pure
your separation was.

00:12:06.530 --> 00:12:10.190
And the GC column
looks like this.

00:12:10.190 --> 00:12:13.420
So it's represented in this
diagram as a curled up circle.

00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:15.890
And so this is actually
what it looks like.

00:12:15.890 --> 00:12:19.040
So this is an old column taken
out of the GC in the lab.

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:20.980
And you can see that
it's very, very thin.

00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:22.593
So this is a capillary column.

00:12:22.593 --> 00:12:24.010
So this is actually
a hollow tube.

00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:26.930
And your sample will travel
through this tube around,

00:12:26.930 --> 00:12:27.790
around, around.

00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:30.676
Does anyone have a guess
about how long this is?

00:12:30.676 --> 00:12:31.560
AUDIENCE: Long.

00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:32.352
SARAH HEWETT: Long.

00:12:32.352 --> 00:12:36.420
[LAUGHS] Yeah, so this is 30
meters of capillary tubing

00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:37.800
all wrapped up here.

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:39.750
And on the inside of
the capillary tubing,

00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:44.520
it is coated with this
polysiloxane mixture which

00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:47.790
will interact with your sample.

00:12:47.790 --> 00:12:51.870
And it'll help cause
the separation.

00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:56.170
So your sample gets inserted
into the injector port.

00:12:56.170 --> 00:12:57.850
This is an oven, so
it gets heated up.

00:12:57.850 --> 00:13:00.140
And you can change the
difference in the temperature.

00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:01.807
And so the difference
in the temperature

00:13:01.807 --> 00:13:05.570
will change the amount of
separation that you get.

00:13:05.570 --> 00:13:08.342
So if you do it hotter,
then your compounds

00:13:08.342 --> 00:13:10.300
will travel through
faster, and you don't maybe

00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:11.475
get as good of a separation.

00:13:11.475 --> 00:13:12.850
If you cool it
down a little bit,

00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:14.110
then you tend to get
better separation,

00:13:14.110 --> 00:13:15.812
but sometimes it can
broaden your peaks.

00:13:15.812 --> 00:13:17.020
So there's a trade-off there.

00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:19.120
We have already made
a program for you

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:21.390
that optimizes the separation
of the two compounds

00:13:21.390 --> 00:13:22.640
that you guys are looking for.

00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:24.223
So you don't have
to worry about that.

00:13:24.223 --> 00:13:26.177
You'll just make up
your sample, inject it,

00:13:26.177 --> 00:13:28.760
it'll go through the column, and
then it reaches the detector.

00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:30.470
And we use a flame
ionization detector.

00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:33.593
So that hydrogen in the
air, they get lit on fire.

00:13:33.593 --> 00:13:36.010
The stuff that comes out of
the column goes into the fire.

00:13:36.010 --> 00:13:38.200
It gets lit on fire,
it produces ions,

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:42.430
and then the ions are detected
by the detector, changes

00:13:42.430 --> 00:13:43.960
the electrical current.

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:47.582
And that is what
gives you your signal.

00:13:47.582 --> 00:13:49.040
This is a very
sensitive technique.

00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:51.260
So you do not need to prepare
very concentrated amounts

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:51.720
of samples.

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:53.637
So we're not going to
inject your oil straight

00:13:53.637 --> 00:13:54.890
into the instrument.

00:13:54.890 --> 00:13:57.230
You are going to do what's
called a double dilution.

00:13:57.230 --> 00:13:59.350
So you will take 50
microliters of your sample

00:13:59.350 --> 00:14:01.850
in one of those micropipettes
that you guys have been using.

00:14:01.850 --> 00:14:03.530
You'll dissolve it in 1
milliliter of pentane,

00:14:03.530 --> 00:14:05.730
so you're already making
a very dilute solution.

00:14:05.730 --> 00:14:08.013
And then you'll take 50
microliters of that solution,

00:14:08.013 --> 00:14:10.430
and you will dissolve it in
another milliliter of pentane.

00:14:10.430 --> 00:14:13.235
And that's what you will
inject into the GC instrument.

00:14:13.235 --> 00:14:14.610
Your TAs will help
you with that.

00:14:14.610 --> 00:14:17.910
But that's just to show you that
it is a very, very sensitive

00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:18.410
technique.

00:14:18.410 --> 00:14:22.130
So you do not need
a lot of volume.

00:14:22.130 --> 00:14:27.320
This is what the output
of the GC looks like.

00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:30.230
And you will get your
GC chromatograph.

00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:36.320
And the units on this are in
abundance and time in minutes.

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:40.985
And so you can see that this is
a GC chromatograph of the oil

00:14:40.985 --> 00:14:42.110
before it's been separated.

00:14:42.110 --> 00:14:44.030
So it has two major
components and a couple

00:14:44.030 --> 00:14:46.010
of smaller impurities.

00:14:46.010 --> 00:14:49.580
And hopefully, if you guys do
your distillation correctly,

00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:50.720
then you'll get--

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:53.193
your fractions will
look like there's not

00:14:53.193 --> 00:14:54.860
very much of one and
a lot of the other,

00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:58.758
and then vice versa for your
limonene and your carvone.

00:14:58.758 --> 00:15:00.800
And the way that you can
tell which peak is which

00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:05.360
is that-- so this column
is pretty non non-polar,

00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:06.080
like I said.

00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:08.450
And the interactions
with the column

00:15:08.450 --> 00:15:11.270
are what separates your mixture.

00:15:11.270 --> 00:15:13.910
But the way that it
is separated is mostly

00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:14.910
through boiling point.

00:15:14.910 --> 00:15:16.678
So when you heat
this compound up--

00:15:16.678 --> 00:15:19.220
and we'll talk about it a little
bit more in the next slide--

00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:20.735
but it'll travel
through the column.

00:15:20.735 --> 00:15:23.360
So things that are more volatile
will travel through the column

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:25.250
faster, so things with
lower boiling point.

00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:26.450
And then, things with
a higher boiling point

00:15:26.450 --> 00:15:27.920
stay on the column for longer.

00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:32.910
So you can use boiling
point to sort of identify

00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:34.745
your compounds.

00:15:34.745 --> 00:15:36.120
And you also get
this information

00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:37.920
at the bottom, which tells
you the retention times

00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:39.128
of your peaks in the minutes.

00:15:39.128 --> 00:15:41.430
And then, it'll also tell
you the area of your peak.

00:15:41.430 --> 00:15:44.320
And you can use the percent
area to calculate your percent

00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:44.820
purity.

00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:48.060
So in this case, we have 41%
of one and 57% of the other.

00:15:48.060 --> 00:15:49.770
So it is not a very pure sample.

00:15:49.770 --> 00:15:52.590
And hopefully, yours will get on
the order of-- you can get well

00:15:52.590 --> 00:15:54.750
above 90% separation.

00:15:54.750 --> 00:15:57.182
So that'll give you
an idea of how well

00:15:57.182 --> 00:15:58.140
your distillation went.

00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:02.980
So some things about
gas chromatography

00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:05.480
that are important to note is
that you can't really identify

00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:06.630
an unknown without a standard.

00:16:06.630 --> 00:16:08.420
So if you just-- if you don't
know what your compound is

00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:10.160
already and you
inject it into the GC,

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:11.660
all you're going to know
is that retention time.

00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:14.090
It doesn't give you any
information about its structure

00:16:14.090 --> 00:16:15.200
or anything else.

00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:17.312
So you can compare
retention times.

00:16:17.312 --> 00:16:18.770
Those are consistent
as long as you

00:16:18.770 --> 00:16:21.140
use the same method,
and the same column,

00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:22.310
and the same carrier gas.

00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:25.430
But you need to have a standard
that you can compare it to.

00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:28.048
Or if you know that there's
two components in your mixture,

00:16:28.048 --> 00:16:30.590
if you know what's in them, then
you can tell which is which,

00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:32.120
again, by their boiling point.

00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:33.620
So it is very useful
for determining

00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:35.960
the purity or the percent
composition of a sample, which

00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:37.550
is what we're going
to use it for.

00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:39.290
And like I said,
separation is determined

00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:41.930
by your stationary phase.

00:16:41.930 --> 00:16:44.370
And the stationary phase is
a liquid coating on there.

00:16:44.370 --> 00:16:50.270
So when you're using
GC chromatography,

00:16:50.270 --> 00:16:52.850
you want to make sure that you
pick a stationary phase that

00:16:52.850 --> 00:16:54.500
matches the type of compound
that you're separating.

00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:56.167
So we're going to use
this non-polar one

00:16:56.167 --> 00:16:59.120
because our compounds
are relatively non-polar.

00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:01.370
But you'll see it
used in extensively

00:17:01.370 --> 00:17:02.340
in other applications.

00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:04.132
So if you're doing a
lot of polar compounds

00:17:04.132 --> 00:17:06.090
with a lot of oxygen
groups or nitrogen groups,

00:17:06.090 --> 00:17:08.210
then you may want to use
a more polar compound.

00:17:08.210 --> 00:17:10.640
You can also get chiral
stationary phases that

00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:12.800
will help separate enantiomers.

00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:13.839
There's all kinds.

00:17:13.839 --> 00:17:17.119
If you go on any of the
Agilent website or anything,

00:17:17.119 --> 00:17:19.160
you can get a whole
list of different types

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:21.410
of stationary phases with
different types of polarity.

00:17:21.410 --> 00:17:24.680
You can substitute these methyl
groups out for other things

00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:29.120
depending on what application
you're trying to use it for.

00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:30.970
And so the way that
we can characterize

00:17:30.970 --> 00:17:33.430
the efficiency of the separation
is by theoretical plates.

00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:34.900
And we mentioned this
really, really briefly when

00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:36.525
we were talking about
the distillation.

00:17:36.525 --> 00:17:38.830
So if you remember,
there was the grow column

00:17:38.830 --> 00:17:40.635
versus the simple distillation.

00:17:40.635 --> 00:17:42.010
So you get better
separation when

00:17:42.010 --> 00:17:44.920
you have more and more of those
cycles where the vapor can

00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:46.420
vaporize and recondense.

00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:49.400
Does that sound
vaguely familiar?

00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:50.193
Good.

00:17:50.193 --> 00:17:52.610
So essentially, that's what's
happening in this GC column.

00:17:52.610 --> 00:17:54.900
So you have a liquid coating
on the inside of this tube.

00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:56.733
And your compounds are
traveling through it.

00:17:56.733 --> 00:17:59.030
And they can be heated
up so they'll repeatedly

00:17:59.030 --> 00:18:01.250
dissolve and then
revaporize in the liquid.

00:18:01.250 --> 00:18:03.710
And the more times they
can do that as they travel

00:18:03.710 --> 00:18:07.520
through this 30 meters of
column, the more efficient

00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:10.120
your separation is going to be.

00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:12.370
And we can calculate
that using a measure

00:18:12.370 --> 00:18:14.160
called theoretical plates.

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:15.910
And it is based on the
idea that one plate

00:18:15.910 --> 00:18:19.180
is one equilibrium between
the liquid in the vapor

00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:21.730
phase, or one of those
vaporization recondensation

00:18:21.730 --> 00:18:22.732
cycles.

00:18:22.732 --> 00:18:24.690
So you can refer to the
temperature composition

00:18:24.690 --> 00:18:26.460
diagrams from the
last lecture if you

00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:29.490
want to get a refresher on
what I mean by the vaporization

00:18:29.490 --> 00:18:30.990
and recondensation.

00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:33.640
And then, you can calculate this
from your chromatogram data.

00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:36.630
So when you have that
chromatograph data

00:18:36.630 --> 00:18:39.790
that has the peaks on it,
you can use this equation.

00:18:39.790 --> 00:18:43.220
So n is the number of
theoretical plates.

00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:46.610
This is just a
standard constant.

00:18:46.610 --> 00:18:50.250
And then your tr is
the retention time.

00:18:50.250 --> 00:18:54.892
So you'll use the retention
time of your peak in some unit.

00:18:54.892 --> 00:18:56.850
And then you want to take
the width of the peak

00:18:56.850 --> 00:19:00.770
at 1/2 of the
height of the peak.

00:19:00.770 --> 00:19:02.180
So I can't go backwards.

00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:03.630
Oh, there it is.

00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:07.430
So for this peak, you would say
your retention time is 1.434.

00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:10.393
And then, you would want
to go halfway up the peak,

00:19:10.393 --> 00:19:12.560
and then take the width of
that peak, which is going

00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:13.700
to be a very small number.

00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:16.580
And the best way to do this
is to probably use a ruler,

00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:18.230
and actually
measure, physically,

00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:20.570
the height of the peak,
and then measure the width

00:19:20.570 --> 00:19:22.410
at the halfway point.

00:19:22.410 --> 00:19:25.280
So if you do that, you
need to make sure that when

00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:27.350
you are using
these measurements,

00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:28.850
that they are in the same units.

00:19:28.850 --> 00:19:30.350
So you can either
do it in the units

00:19:30.350 --> 00:19:32.930
of time, which is what it's
given to you on the GC.

00:19:32.930 --> 00:19:34.580
But it's probably
a little easier

00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:36.588
if you do it in
millimeters or centimeters,

00:19:36.588 --> 00:19:37.880
however you want to measure it.

00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:40.550
Just make sure that
you also-- if you're

00:19:40.550 --> 00:19:43.580
going to measure your width
in centimeters or millimeters

00:19:43.580 --> 00:19:46.670
that you also measure your
retention time in centimeters

00:19:46.670 --> 00:19:47.385
or millimeters.

00:19:47.385 --> 00:19:49.010
And the retention
time is just the time

00:19:49.010 --> 00:19:52.460
from the beginning to
where your peak is.

00:19:57.480 --> 00:20:00.240
So that's GC spectroscopy.

00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:04.840
And now, we can talk a little
bit about IR spectroscopy.

00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:07.710
And if we take a
moment and think

00:20:07.710 --> 00:20:13.550
about our
electromagnetic spectrum,

00:20:13.550 --> 00:20:15.880
we can think about the
different types of energy

00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:18.440
that you have available in
the electromagnetic spectrum.

00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:21.110
So if this is our
wavelength in meters,

00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:23.420
what is our thing with the
smallest wavelength, highest

00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:23.920
energy?

00:20:26.350 --> 00:20:28.640
Anyone?

00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:29.360
Gamma rays.

00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:33.280
Then?

00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:38.935
AUDIENCE: X-rays?

00:20:38.935 --> 00:20:41.400
SARAH HEWETT: Then?

00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:42.487
UV.

00:20:42.487 --> 00:20:43.320
The little tiny one?

00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:44.010
AUDIENCE: Visible.

00:20:44.010 --> 00:20:44.927
SARAH HEWETT: Visible.

00:20:44.927 --> 00:20:46.170
AUDIENCE: And then infrared.

00:20:46.170 --> 00:20:47.128
SARAH HEWETT: Infrared.

00:20:47.128 --> 00:20:48.210
AUDIENCE: Microwave.

00:20:48.210 --> 00:20:54.090
SARAH HEWETT: And then,
yeah, microwave and radio.

00:20:57.740 --> 00:21:00.350
All right, so from highest
energy to lowest energy,

00:21:00.350 --> 00:21:02.260
this is our
electromagnetic spectrum.

00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:05.930
And so IR spectroscopy
uses IR radiation

00:21:05.930 --> 00:21:09.250
to give us information
about a molecule.

00:21:09.250 --> 00:21:11.000
And the way that this
happens is that it's

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:12.875
very useful for identifying
functional groups

00:21:12.875 --> 00:21:13.640
in a molecule.

00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:17.090
And you pass this IR radiation
through the molecule.

00:21:17.090 --> 00:21:20.360
And all of the bonds
in your molecule

00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:23.090
have some sort of vibrational
energy associated with them.

00:21:23.090 --> 00:21:26.570
They're vibrating at
a certain frequency

00:21:26.570 --> 00:21:30.290
which corresponds to energy in
the IR region of the spectrum.

00:21:30.290 --> 00:21:34.190
So if you pass IR radiation
through your sample,

00:21:34.190 --> 00:21:37.300
then some of the
wavelengths will match up

00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:40.570
with the frequencies of the
vibrations of your bonds.

00:21:40.570 --> 00:21:43.138
And it will get absorbed.

00:21:43.138 --> 00:21:45.430
And then, you can measure
how much light comes back out

00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:46.570
and how much light
gets absorbed.

00:21:46.570 --> 00:21:48.670
And you can get an IR spectrum
of your molecule, which

00:21:48.670 --> 00:21:51.128
is representative of all the
different bonds and the energy

00:21:51.128 --> 00:21:52.470
that they absorb.

00:21:52.470 --> 00:21:57.120
The frequency of light or
energy that a bond absorbs

00:21:57.120 --> 00:22:00.180
is dependent on the
mass of the two atoms

00:22:00.180 --> 00:22:02.970
that are attached in the
bond, the bond strength,

00:22:02.970 --> 00:22:04.290
and the chemical environment.

00:22:04.290 --> 00:22:06.570
And this is related
by Hooke's law,

00:22:06.570 --> 00:22:09.238
if you're familiar with
physics, that talks about-- you

00:22:09.238 --> 00:22:11.280
can think about it as two
masses on opposite ends

00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:13.320
of the string-- or a spring.

00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:16.430
And so how much force you
need, or what the frequency is

00:22:16.430 --> 00:22:18.750
that that spring
will oscillate on

00:22:18.750 --> 00:22:21.050
depends on all of these factors.

00:22:21.050 --> 00:22:23.100
And so if you have something
that has a high bond

00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:26.812
order, like a double bond or
a triple bond, then those--

00:22:26.812 --> 00:22:28.020
that's a really tight spring.

00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:30.030
So it's going to vibrate
at a very high frequency,

00:22:30.030 --> 00:22:31.988
and it's going to take
a lot more energy to get

00:22:31.988 --> 00:22:33.570
that vibration to happen.

00:22:33.570 --> 00:22:35.340
Whereas if there are
two light atoms that

00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:37.007
are attached by a
single bond, then they

00:22:37.007 --> 00:22:41.080
will vibrate at a much lower
frequency-- less energy.

00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:44.160
Make sense, sort of?

00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:46.140
So vibrations are only
IR active if they change

00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:47.330
the dipole moment of a bond.

00:22:47.330 --> 00:22:50.050
So you can't see all the bonds
in your molecule using IR

00:22:50.050 --> 00:22:50.820
spectroscopy.

00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:52.860
You'll be able to see the ones--

00:22:52.860 --> 00:22:56.340
we can see most of them,
since most molecules are not

00:22:56.340 --> 00:22:57.450
perfectly symmetric.

00:22:57.450 --> 00:22:59.610
But like carbon-carbon
bonds, that stretch

00:22:59.610 --> 00:23:01.950
does not really change
the dipole much.

00:23:01.950 --> 00:23:04.180
So you don't see those
very strongly, if at all,

00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:05.490
in most of your IR spectra.

00:23:09.070 --> 00:23:10.960
So there are a bunch
of different ways

00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:14.650
that a bond or a
molecule can vibrate.

00:23:14.650 --> 00:23:18.340
And the number of possible
vibrational modes in a molecule

00:23:18.340 --> 00:23:20.720
is determined from the
degrees of freedom.

00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:23.590
So if you think
about a molecule,

00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:27.790
it can move in the
three dimensions

00:23:27.790 --> 00:23:30.258
of space translationally.

00:23:30.258 --> 00:23:32.800
And so all of the atoms can also
move in the three dimensions

00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:33.300
of space.

00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:36.410
So you get-- you start
with 3N degrees of freedom,

00:23:36.410 --> 00:23:39.580
so N being the number of
atoms in your molecule.

00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:42.310
And then in a linear
molecule, you have--

00:23:45.050 --> 00:23:46.690
you can also have
rotationally modes.

00:23:46.690 --> 00:23:48.065
But one of the
rotationally modes

00:23:48.065 --> 00:23:51.225
does not quite work as
well, because it's along

00:23:51.225 --> 00:23:52.100
the axis of the bond.

00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:54.517
So you're not changing anything
if you rotate it that way.

00:23:54.517 --> 00:23:57.433
So we end up with 3N
minus 5 vibrational

00:23:57.433 --> 00:23:58.600
stretching or bending modes.

00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:01.150
And then, in a
nonlinear molecule,

00:24:01.150 --> 00:24:05.540
you get all three translational
and all three rotational modes.

00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:07.210
So you do 3N minus 6.

00:24:07.210 --> 00:24:10.900
And so that gets rid of the
translational and rotational

00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:12.255
motion.

00:24:12.255 --> 00:24:13.630
So what's left is
the vibrational

00:24:13.630 --> 00:24:17.180
stretching or bending
modes in your molecule.

00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:19.270
And so the possible
vibrations that we

00:24:19.270 --> 00:24:23.130
can have are as follows--

00:24:23.130 --> 00:24:25.463
the symmetric stretch, the
asymmetric stretch, the bend,

00:24:25.463 --> 00:24:26.797
the wag, the twist, and rocking.

00:24:26.797 --> 00:24:28.250
So I need everybody to stand up.

00:24:28.250 --> 00:24:30.570
If you've done this before,
we're doing it again.

00:24:30.570 --> 00:24:33.120
This is a rite of passage
in a chemistry lab.

00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:36.080
We are going to--

00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:38.090
I will wait.

00:24:38.090 --> 00:24:41.330
We are going to pretend
that we are molecules,

00:24:41.330 --> 00:24:45.318
and we are going to act out all
of these different vibrations

00:24:45.318 --> 00:24:47.360
that can happen in your
molecule so that you have

00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:50.660
an idea of what you are looking
for when you see your IR

00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:51.330
spectrum.

00:24:51.330 --> 00:24:57.322
So if your body is like a
carbon, and then the rest of,

00:24:57.322 --> 00:24:59.030
like, your legs are
another carbon chain,

00:24:59.030 --> 00:25:01.890
then say you have two
hydrogen atoms in your hands.

00:25:01.890 --> 00:25:02.670
Great.

00:25:02.670 --> 00:25:04.790
We are excellent
methylene groups.

00:25:04.790 --> 00:25:06.260
So a symmetric stretch--

00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:07.640
any ideas?

00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:11.060
Yeah, when they go
at the same time.

00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:12.530
Excellent.

00:25:12.530 --> 00:25:14.420
The asymmetric stretch?

00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:17.750
Yeah, opposite, excellent.

00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:21.375
The bend or scissor?

00:25:21.375 --> 00:25:21.875
Excellent.

00:25:21.875 --> 00:25:23.458
So you're all getting
a workout today.

00:25:23.458 --> 00:25:24.650
This is great.

00:25:24.650 --> 00:25:26.570
The wag?

00:25:26.570 --> 00:25:28.960
The wag is back
and forth, like--

00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:30.240
yeah, there you go.

00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:31.700
Excellent.

00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:33.770
Twisting?

00:25:33.770 --> 00:25:35.270
One goes back, one goes forward.

00:25:35.270 --> 00:25:37.140
There we go.

00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:39.005
And then last one, rocking?

00:25:39.005 --> 00:25:40.130
That's what you had before.

00:25:40.130 --> 00:25:44.330
They're going back and
forth at the same time.

00:25:44.330 --> 00:25:45.110
Excellent!

00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:47.302
Well done.

00:25:47.302 --> 00:25:48.260
Give yourselves a hand.

00:25:53.930 --> 00:25:56.750
It's a good way to get
everybody up and moving.

00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:05.160
So those are our IR
vibrational modes,

00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:08.640
and those are all the ways that
you can make your molecules

00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:10.320
vibrate.

00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:12.130
And so now, how do
we measure this?

00:26:12.130 --> 00:26:15.130
And this is the
ATR spectrometer.

00:26:15.130 --> 00:26:16.380
It's an infrared spectrometer.

00:26:16.380 --> 00:26:18.047
This is the one that
we have in the lab.

00:26:18.047 --> 00:26:21.438
And it's in the very back
corner by the door in A prime 4.

00:26:21.438 --> 00:26:22.980
So some of you guys
may have seen it.

00:26:22.980 --> 00:26:25.470
You may have seen some of the
other lab groups coming in

00:26:25.470 --> 00:26:26.610
to use it.

00:26:26.610 --> 00:26:28.440
And the way that
this works is, it's

00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:31.230
a pretty simple instrument
in terms of what

00:26:31.230 --> 00:26:32.670
you need to do to use it.

00:26:32.670 --> 00:26:34.560
There is a crystal right here.

00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:37.170
And the crystals are usually
made of zinc selenide,

00:26:37.170 --> 00:26:40.470
or I believe, in our
case, it's a diamond.

00:26:40.470 --> 00:26:42.360
And it's a pretty tiny crystal.

00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:44.830
It's just that very, very
small little dot in the center.

00:26:44.830 --> 00:26:47.600
And you can take your
compound and put it

00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:48.600
straight on the crystal.

00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:51.660
And if it's a
solid, then you can

00:26:51.660 --> 00:26:54.373
use-- this is a
little pressure thing.

00:26:54.373 --> 00:26:56.790
So you can lower that, and
it'll press your solid right up

00:26:56.790 --> 00:26:58.740
against the crystal so
you get good contact.

00:26:58.740 --> 00:27:00.630
Or you can just put a couple
of drops of your liquid right

00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:02.755
on the crystal, and then
it has good contact anyway

00:27:02.755 --> 00:27:05.330
because it's a liquid.

00:27:05.330 --> 00:27:11.705
And-- oh, so the ATR stands for
attenuated total reflectance.

00:27:25.070 --> 00:27:29.630
And how it works is you have
a source of your IR energy.

00:27:29.630 --> 00:27:32.653
And these are some mirrors.

00:27:32.653 --> 00:27:33.820
And so you have your energy.

00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:34.490
It comes in here.

00:27:34.490 --> 00:27:35.930
It hits the mirror, and
then it gets directed up

00:27:35.930 --> 00:27:37.040
through this crystal.

00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:39.950
And like I said, you're
going to put your sample

00:27:39.950 --> 00:27:40.910
on top of the crystal.

00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:48.450
And you want to get really
good contact, because the IR

00:27:48.450 --> 00:27:51.510
energy will travel
through the crystal,

00:27:51.510 --> 00:27:54.120
and it'll interact with the
very bottom layer of your sample

00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:54.620
there.

00:27:57.003 --> 00:27:58.670
And then, it'll get
reflected back down.

00:27:58.670 --> 00:28:00.635
And in some cases, there's
only one reflection,

00:28:00.635 --> 00:28:02.010
and then it goes
to the detector.

00:28:02.010 --> 00:28:04.427
And in other cases, depending
on the size of your crystal,

00:28:04.427 --> 00:28:06.083
you can get multiple
reflections.

00:28:09.260 --> 00:28:12.000
And when the light interacts
with your sample, like I said,

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:17.010
it'll absorb some of the
wavelengths of the IR light.

00:28:17.010 --> 00:28:18.680
So some of this
will get absorbed.

00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:21.740
And then, that's
the attenuation part

00:28:21.740 --> 00:28:24.180
is that some wavelengths
will be decreased

00:28:24.180 --> 00:28:27.470
in intensity because they'll
be absorbed by your compound.

00:28:27.470 --> 00:28:29.482
And then, the reflectance
part is the light

00:28:29.482 --> 00:28:31.940
gets reflected down through
this crystal into the detector.

00:28:31.940 --> 00:28:33.680
And then the detector
can determine

00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:36.050
which wavelengths of light
were absorbed and how much.

00:28:38.820 --> 00:28:42.210
And that is IR in a
very simplified fashion.

00:28:42.210 --> 00:28:46.063
There's more descriptions
of it in your Mohrig book.

00:28:46.063 --> 00:28:48.480
So if you guys have this book
or if you want to borrow it,

00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:50.460
there's an excellent
description of how different

00:28:50.460 --> 00:28:51.377
IR spectrometers work.

00:28:51.377 --> 00:28:54.000
There are a couple of different
ways to get IR samples.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:57.240
So like ATR is great
for liquids and solids.

00:28:57.240 --> 00:28:59.760
You can also have IR
spectrometers that just--

00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:02.850
you set your sample up on
some sort of support that's,

00:29:02.850 --> 00:29:03.870
like, vertical.

00:29:03.870 --> 00:29:05.850
And then you pass the
beam straight through it,

00:29:05.850 --> 00:29:07.892
and you measure what comes
out on the other side,

00:29:07.892 --> 00:29:09.600
kind of like the
UV-Vis that you did.

00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:11.970
So there's a couple
different ways to do IR.

00:29:11.970 --> 00:29:16.877
But this is the way that we're
going to be using in the lab.

00:29:16.877 --> 00:29:18.710
And what you get out
of it is an IR spectrum

00:29:18.710 --> 00:29:20.640
that looks something like this.

00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:22.520
So I took these straight
from the lab manual.

00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:26.210
And these are IR
spectra of carvone.

00:29:26.210 --> 00:29:28.550
And that's the carvone
from the caraway seed oil,

00:29:28.550 --> 00:29:30.550
and that's the carvone
from your peppermint oil.

00:29:30.550 --> 00:29:32.522
And do we see any differences?

00:29:37.610 --> 00:29:39.620
Not really.

00:29:39.620 --> 00:29:42.395
So what do we know is
different about the carvone

00:29:42.395 --> 00:29:44.270
from the caraway seed
and the peppermint oil?

00:29:48.070 --> 00:29:49.000
The stereochemistry.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:51.740
So we know that one is the
R form of the molecule,

00:29:51.740 --> 00:29:54.550
and the other is the
S. So this is the S

00:29:54.550 --> 00:29:56.290
and this is the R.
So is IR spectroscopy

00:29:56.290 --> 00:29:58.940
good at differentiating
between isomers?

00:29:58.940 --> 00:29:59.980
Nope, not at all.

00:29:59.980 --> 00:30:01.480
It just tells you what
functional groups are there.

00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:03.310
It doesn't really tell you
in what order they are in.

00:30:03.310 --> 00:30:05.643
So you'll need to do a different
spectroscopic technique

00:30:05.643 --> 00:30:07.220
if you want to figure that out.

00:30:07.220 --> 00:30:08.680
But we can get a
lot of information

00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:11.980
about different bonds that
are in our molecule, which

00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:16.320
is helpful for identifying
different things.

00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:17.857
What do we have next?

00:30:17.857 --> 00:30:20.190
So, yeah, we can talk about
interpreting an IR spectrum.

00:30:20.190 --> 00:30:23.070
So in your book
or on the internet

00:30:23.070 --> 00:30:25.440
there are many, many
charts that have

00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:27.895
lists and lists of the IR--

00:30:27.895 --> 00:30:29.460
oh, my bookmark fell out.

00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:30.430
Oh here it is.

00:30:30.430 --> 00:30:32.220
So there is a chart
in the Mohrig book

00:30:32.220 --> 00:30:35.430
that has a list of all of
the different stretching

00:30:35.430 --> 00:30:37.650
frequencies for different
functional groups.

00:30:37.650 --> 00:30:39.360
And it has the
stretching, the bending,

00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:41.580
and anything that
you are typically

00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:42.875
able to see in an IR spectrum.

00:30:42.875 --> 00:30:44.250
And it tells you
where you should

00:30:44.250 --> 00:30:48.520
look for it in the spectrum
in terms of wave numbers.

00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:52.470
So if you look at the
axes of these things,

00:30:52.470 --> 00:30:56.830
the left axis here is
percent transmittance,

00:30:56.830 --> 00:30:59.340
so how much of the
light gets through.

00:30:59.340 --> 00:31:02.390
And then, the--
so the top is 100.

00:31:02.390 --> 00:31:05.310
So if nothing is absorbed,
it'll be a baseline at the top.

00:31:05.310 --> 00:31:07.110
And then if things
are absorbed strongly,

00:31:07.110 --> 00:31:10.320
then the transmittance goes
down and you get a big peak.

00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:13.740
And then the wave, the other
axis along the bottom here,

00:31:13.740 --> 00:31:14.310
is--

00:31:14.310 --> 00:31:16.518
well, on the bottom of this
one, it's in micrometers.

00:31:16.518 --> 00:31:20.972
But in most cases in IR
now, we use wave numbers

00:31:20.972 --> 00:31:22.680
because it's a linear
measurement instead

00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:24.362
of non-linear.

00:31:24.362 --> 00:31:26.070
So wave numbers
corresponds to the amount

00:31:26.070 --> 00:31:29.880
of energy in the molecule--
or in the photon.

00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:32.173
So we can get these
charts of where

00:31:32.173 --> 00:31:33.590
different functional
groups absorb

00:31:33.590 --> 00:31:34.632
in terms of wave numbers.

00:31:34.632 --> 00:31:36.960
So these are all
in wave numbers,

00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:42.060
which is inverse centimeters.

00:31:42.060 --> 00:31:43.910
So when you get your
IR spectrum back

00:31:43.910 --> 00:31:45.770
and you take it in the lab,
you're going to print it out.

00:31:45.770 --> 00:31:48.020
And then, you can use one
of these charts to help you.

00:31:48.020 --> 00:31:50.420
And the best place to start
looking at an IR spectrum

00:31:50.420 --> 00:31:58.753
is between 4,000 and 1,400 wave
numbers, so, like, this half.

00:31:58.753 --> 00:32:00.170
Because you can
see, on this side,

00:32:00.170 --> 00:32:01.650
there's a lot
going on down here.

00:32:01.650 --> 00:32:04.350
And you might say, oh, that's
got a ton of information in it.

00:32:04.350 --> 00:32:05.012
Not so much.

00:32:05.012 --> 00:32:06.720
So this is called the
fingerprint region.

00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:08.090
And it does have a lot
of information in it.

00:32:08.090 --> 00:32:10.298
And before there were other
spectroscopic techniques,

00:32:10.298 --> 00:32:13.160
people spent a lot of time
trying to identify peaks down

00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:14.720
here.

00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:18.890
But they're less representative
of actual specific bonds.

00:32:18.890 --> 00:32:22.610
A lot of it's, like, overtones
and other resonance happening.

00:32:22.610 --> 00:32:25.670
And these are unique
to every chemical.

00:32:25.670 --> 00:32:27.230
So if you have a
reference spectrum

00:32:27.230 --> 00:32:28.910
and then you have your
spectrum, you can match them up

00:32:28.910 --> 00:32:31.130
and the fingerprint region
should match really well.

00:32:31.130 --> 00:32:33.230
But it's kind of
hard to interpret,

00:32:33.230 --> 00:32:34.430
and it's usually very messy.

00:32:34.430 --> 00:32:36.860
So we kind of ignore
this at the beginning.

00:32:36.860 --> 00:32:38.895
And then, if you look
over here, then there's

00:32:38.895 --> 00:32:40.520
a lot fewer peaks to
deal with and they

00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:44.390
provide a lot of information.

00:32:44.390 --> 00:32:48.220
So you'll see that the C-H
stretches are typically around,

00:32:48.220 --> 00:32:51.490
like, 2,800 to
3,100 wave numbers.

00:32:51.490 --> 00:32:54.130
And it depends on whether
it's a single bond

00:32:54.130 --> 00:32:57.637
like an alkane C-H, or
alkene, or an aromatic where

00:32:57.637 --> 00:32:58.220
they come out.

00:32:58.220 --> 00:33:03.100
So these guys, you'll
have different peaks,

00:33:03.100 --> 00:33:06.370
because we have some alkene
C-H's and some alkane C-H's.

00:33:06.370 --> 00:33:11.297
So you'll have a whole variety
of C-H stretching there.

00:33:11.297 --> 00:33:12.880
And then, what other
functional groups

00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:14.560
do we have in the molecule?

00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:15.710
What's the other main one?

00:33:15.710 --> 00:33:16.390
AUDIENCE: CO.

00:33:16.390 --> 00:33:17.265
SARAH HEWETT: The CO.

00:33:17.265 --> 00:33:20.650
And the CO double bond is one
of the most characteristic peaks

00:33:20.650 --> 00:33:22.150
that you can find
in an IR spectrum.

00:33:22.150 --> 00:33:25.030
And it always comes out
somewhere between 1600, 1700.

00:33:25.030 --> 00:33:27.110
So you can see, at 1700,
there is this huge peak.

00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:28.735
It is the biggest
peak in the spectrum.

00:33:28.735 --> 00:33:30.887
And that corresponds to
that CO double bond there.

00:33:30.887 --> 00:33:32.470
So that's always a
good place to start

00:33:32.470 --> 00:33:34.762
if you are looking to identify
something that you think

00:33:34.762 --> 00:33:35.990
may have a carbonyl in it.

00:33:35.990 --> 00:33:36.490
Yes?

00:33:36.490 --> 00:33:39.679
AUDIENCE: So can you tell how
many C-c bonds there are based

00:33:39.679 --> 00:33:41.420
on the height of the peak?

00:33:41.420 --> 00:33:43.100
SARAH HEWETT: No.

00:33:43.100 --> 00:33:45.500
So the height of the
peak doesn't give you

00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:48.080
any specific information
like how many there are.

00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:52.070
In amines, if you have a primary
versus a secondary amine--

00:33:52.070 --> 00:33:55.910
so if you have an
amine with 1 H on it,

00:33:55.910 --> 00:34:00.920
and some other R group
versus two H's, you'll

00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:03.470
see either two peaks and
the amine or one peak.

00:34:03.470 --> 00:34:06.410
So that's when you can
quantify atoms through this.

00:34:06.410 --> 00:34:11.650
But no, the intensity
does not always

00:34:11.650 --> 00:34:13.600
correspond to how
many of the bond

00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:17.018
there are, since the intensity
is mostly a function of how

00:34:17.018 --> 00:34:18.310
much the dipole moment changes.

00:34:18.310 --> 00:34:20.469
So you could have
a lot of C-H bonds,

00:34:20.469 --> 00:34:23.020
but you won't see a whole--

00:34:23.020 --> 00:34:25.370
like, a very intense peak.

00:34:25.370 --> 00:34:25.870
Yeah.

00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:30.909
Whoops!

00:34:30.909 --> 00:34:32.380
Go back.

00:34:32.380 --> 00:34:34.900
So things that you should do
is to look for what is there

00:34:34.900 --> 00:34:36.210
and look for what is not there.

00:34:36.210 --> 00:34:37.719
So if you know what's
supposed to be there

00:34:37.719 --> 00:34:38.725
in your functional
groups because you know

00:34:38.725 --> 00:34:39.969
the structure of your
molecule, then you

00:34:39.969 --> 00:34:41.920
can try to identify the
peaks that correspond

00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:43.460
to those functional groups.

00:34:43.460 --> 00:34:45.668
So if you are anticipating
having an O-H stretch,

00:34:45.668 --> 00:34:47.710
like you've made an alcohol
or a carboxylic acid,

00:34:47.710 --> 00:34:50.440
then you should see
a giant, broad peak

00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:53.965
around 3,500 wave numbers.

00:34:53.965 --> 00:34:56.340
And you should also, if you
are making a carboxylic acid,

00:34:56.340 --> 00:34:57.630
you should see this
O-H stretch, and you

00:34:57.630 --> 00:34:58.620
should see your carbonyl peak.

00:34:58.620 --> 00:35:00.037
So you need to be
able to identify

00:35:00.037 --> 00:35:01.412
all the peaks that
are associated

00:35:01.412 --> 00:35:02.770
with a certain functional group.

00:35:02.770 --> 00:35:05.187
So don't say that you have a
carboxylic acid if you cannot

00:35:05.187 --> 00:35:06.240
find either--

00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:08.470
if you cannot find
both of these peaks.

00:35:08.470 --> 00:35:10.310
They will be there.

00:35:10.310 --> 00:35:13.700
And then, less helpful
for us maybe now,

00:35:13.700 --> 00:35:16.883
but in the ester lab, which
we'll talk about later,

00:35:16.883 --> 00:35:18.550
you can also look for
what is not there.

00:35:18.550 --> 00:35:19.640
So if you're trying
to figure out

00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:21.170
if your synthesis
was successful,

00:35:21.170 --> 00:35:22.940
and you start with an
alcohol, and you're supposed

00:35:22.940 --> 00:35:25.148
to end with something that
does not have an O-H peak,

00:35:25.148 --> 00:35:27.350
then you can look for the
absence of an O-H stretch.

00:35:27.350 --> 00:35:28.940
Or if you're trying to
get rid of a carbonyl,

00:35:28.940 --> 00:35:30.315
then you can say
what's not there

00:35:30.315 --> 00:35:34.490
if you're trying to hydrogenate
some sort of double bond.

00:35:34.490 --> 00:35:36.840
You can figure out what is
there and what is not there.

00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:40.100
So those are things you can
talk about in your discussion.

00:35:40.100 --> 00:35:41.810
And your IR spectrum
in your report

00:35:41.810 --> 00:35:43.222
should be attached
as an appendix

00:35:43.222 --> 00:35:44.180
with key peaks labeled.

00:35:44.180 --> 00:35:45.770
So you can actually,
on your spectrum,

00:35:45.770 --> 00:35:49.220
write what each peak represents.

00:35:49.220 --> 00:35:51.260
So if you see a
giant peak at 1700,

00:35:51.260 --> 00:35:55.643
you can draw an arrow to it and
say, C double bond O stretch.

00:35:55.643 --> 00:35:57.060
And the way that
this is typically

00:35:57.060 --> 00:35:58.410
reported in the
literature-- and there's

00:35:58.410 --> 00:35:59.530
a bunch of different
ways to do it.

00:35:59.530 --> 00:36:01.988
You can check out the ACS style
guide for more information.

00:36:01.988 --> 00:36:04.115
But you'll say, IR spectroscopy.

00:36:04.115 --> 00:36:06.990
You use the type of IR
spectroscopy, which in our case

00:36:06.990 --> 00:36:07.878
is going to be ATR.

00:36:07.878 --> 00:36:10.170
So there is, like, thin film,
there's potassium bromide

00:36:10.170 --> 00:36:11.520
pellets, there's all
kinds of different ways

00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:13.140
that you can take
an IR spectrum.

00:36:13.140 --> 00:36:16.410
And the method that you use will
also affect the peak intensity.

00:36:16.410 --> 00:36:22.260
So that's why it's not as
helpful of a thing to look at.

00:36:22.260 --> 00:36:24.660
And then, your units,
wave numbers, and then

00:36:24.660 --> 00:36:28.660
your key peaks-- so if you have
a peak that is really broad,

00:36:28.660 --> 00:36:30.240
you only have to report.

00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:34.200
And you'll see that most of
the peaks in an IR spectrum

00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:35.730
are not super sharp.

00:36:35.730 --> 00:36:38.700
So this carbonyl peak,
if you look at the base,

00:36:38.700 --> 00:36:40.927
it ranges through a good
number of wave numbers.

00:36:40.927 --> 00:36:43.260
But when you report it, you
only report the wave numbers

00:36:43.260 --> 00:36:46.230
of the highest intensity.

00:36:46.230 --> 00:36:49.230
And the instrument will
print that out for you

00:36:49.230 --> 00:36:52.470
on your spectrum, so you'll
know what the highest

00:36:52.470 --> 00:36:56.010
intensity is for your peak.

00:36:56.010 --> 00:36:59.490
So you can report the highest
intensity wave numbers

00:36:59.490 --> 00:37:00.690
for each of your peaks.

00:37:00.690 --> 00:37:04.210
And if you know what the
peak is, in some cases,

00:37:04.210 --> 00:37:06.660
people will put what
bond it represents.

00:37:06.660 --> 00:37:09.180
You don't have to.

00:37:09.180 --> 00:37:10.745
It was acceptable
to do it both ways

00:37:10.745 --> 00:37:12.120
according to the
ACS style guide.

00:37:12.120 --> 00:37:14.750
So that's kind of up to you.

00:37:14.750 --> 00:37:18.118
A little more helpful for
the person reading it, but--

00:37:18.118 --> 00:37:19.910
So if we want to take
a look really quickly

00:37:19.910 --> 00:37:23.480
at a couple of IR spectra
of molecules that--

00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:24.650
well, this one you may know.

00:37:24.650 --> 00:37:26.340
So this is the IR
spectrum of ethanol.

00:37:26.340 --> 00:37:28.820
And what is the major feature
that we care about here?

00:37:32.490 --> 00:37:34.310
So there's the C--

00:37:34.310 --> 00:37:36.630
C-O, but the-- yeah, there's
the O-H. So the biggest,

00:37:36.630 --> 00:37:39.770
strongest feature
here is our O-H peak.

00:37:39.770 --> 00:37:42.080
And O-H peaks are
typically quite broad.

00:37:42.080 --> 00:37:44.330
So they're not as sharp and
defined as the other peaks

00:37:44.330 --> 00:37:44.820
in the spectrum.

00:37:44.820 --> 00:37:46.820
So that's one of the
characteristic ways you can

00:37:46.820 --> 00:37:49.722
know if you have an alcohol.

00:37:49.722 --> 00:37:50.680
And then, you can look.

00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:54.370
And we have some methyl
C-H's and ethyl C-H's here.

00:37:54.370 --> 00:37:56.650
So you have alkane C-H's.

00:37:56.650 --> 00:38:01.090
And so those show up a little
bit below 3,000 wave numbers.

00:38:01.090 --> 00:38:02.050
Great.

00:38:02.050 --> 00:38:04.150
And then, you may
be able to find

00:38:04.150 --> 00:38:06.790
the C-O bond that typically
shows up around 1,000,

00:38:06.790 --> 00:38:07.400
give or take.

00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:12.363
So maybe one of those peaks
is your C-O stretch as well.

00:38:12.363 --> 00:38:14.530
So sometimes you can go
into that fingerprint region

00:38:14.530 --> 00:38:15.880
if you know that there
is something there

00:38:15.880 --> 00:38:16.922
that you are looking for.

00:38:16.922 --> 00:38:19.615
So the C-O stretch is one
that you typically can see,

00:38:19.615 --> 00:38:20.990
and it's typically
pretty strong.

00:38:20.990 --> 00:38:23.380
So in this case, it is there.

00:38:23.380 --> 00:38:27.520
But, yeah, and then
another example

00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:31.390
is this compound, which
is 3, 7 dimethyl octonal.

00:38:31.390 --> 00:38:34.090
And what do we have here that's
really strong and sticking out?

00:38:38.490 --> 00:38:41.383
D double bond O, again, right
here around 1700 wave numbers,

00:38:41.383 --> 00:38:43.050
that's always a dead
giveaway that there

00:38:43.050 --> 00:38:44.850
is some sort of carbonyl peak.

00:38:44.850 --> 00:38:46.747
And if you have an
aldehyde peak, then--

00:38:46.747 --> 00:38:48.330
I didn't write it
up here-- but you'll

00:38:48.330 --> 00:38:51.990
have a characteristic stretch
for this aldehyde hydrogen that

00:38:51.990 --> 00:38:54.650
is also up here.

00:38:54.650 --> 00:38:58.100
And then you have a couple
of alkene C-H stretches,

00:38:58.100 --> 00:38:59.630
and a bunch of
alkane C-H stretches.

00:38:59.630 --> 00:39:01.730
So in this case, there
is a lot going on

00:39:01.730 --> 00:39:03.510
in our stretching region.

00:39:03.510 --> 00:39:06.730
And those are the major
features of that spectrum.

00:39:06.730 --> 00:39:08.803
So we'll go over this
a little bit more also,

00:39:08.803 --> 00:39:10.470
again, when we talk
about the ester lab.

00:39:10.470 --> 00:39:12.850
Because you're going to be
using IR for that lab as well.

00:39:12.850 --> 00:39:14.430
We can talk about some of the
different functional groups

00:39:14.430 --> 00:39:15.900
that you can see in
that case, because we're

00:39:15.900 --> 00:39:17.400
going to be dealing
with, obviously,

00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:21.500
esters, and some alcohols,
and some ketones,

00:39:21.500 --> 00:39:23.350
and some carboxylic acids.

00:39:23.350 --> 00:39:28.990
So that is a brief
overview of IR.

00:39:28.990 --> 00:39:31.120
So we have one more
technique left to talk about,

00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:33.790
and it is the polarimetry.

00:39:33.790 --> 00:39:37.210
And to talk about
that, first, we're

00:39:37.210 --> 00:39:40.150
going to do another round of
synthesis with your products

00:39:40.150 --> 00:39:42.322
that you've separated in
your initial distillation.

00:39:42.322 --> 00:39:43.780
So you have your
limonene fraction,

00:39:43.780 --> 00:39:45.363
your carvone fraction,
and we're going

00:39:45.363 --> 00:39:47.230
to take the carvone
fraction and synthesize

00:39:47.230 --> 00:39:51.430
a semi-carbazone, which will
look something like this.

00:39:51.430 --> 00:39:53.620
And you will make this molecule.

00:39:53.620 --> 00:39:55.170
It'll still have
your stereocenter.

00:39:55.170 --> 00:39:56.250
We're not touching that.

00:39:56.250 --> 00:39:59.130
So it'll keep your
RS configuration.

00:39:59.130 --> 00:40:01.158
And it'll be a solid, though.

00:40:01.158 --> 00:40:02.700
So you're going to
start with an oil.

00:40:02.700 --> 00:40:04.320
You will go through
this synthesis.

00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:06.612
And then you'll end up with
white needle-like crystals.

00:40:06.612 --> 00:40:09.930
So you're going to recrystallize
your product very, very slowly.

00:40:09.930 --> 00:40:11.740
And your TAs will show
you how to do that.

00:40:11.740 --> 00:40:13.573
There's a good procedure
in your lab manual,

00:40:13.573 --> 00:40:15.120
but you're going
to do the reaction,

00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:16.860
and then you're going to
let it sit in your lab bench

00:40:16.860 --> 00:40:19.237
until the next lab period,
so for a couple of days.

00:40:19.237 --> 00:40:21.570
And you want the crystals to
grow really, really slowly.

00:40:21.570 --> 00:40:24.870
So you will not see them
when you first make them,

00:40:24.870 --> 00:40:26.370
but you'll see them,
hopefully, when

00:40:26.370 --> 00:40:27.840
you come to lab the next time.

00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:29.850
And the slower the crystals
grow, the more pure they are.

00:40:29.850 --> 00:40:32.040
And then, we are going to
need very pure crystals,

00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:33.957
because these are what
you're going to analyze

00:40:33.957 --> 00:40:35.430
by X-ray crystallography.

00:40:35.430 --> 00:40:38.250
And like I said, Peter
Muller will come and give you

00:40:38.250 --> 00:40:39.610
more information on that.

00:40:39.610 --> 00:40:41.760
So stay tuned.

00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:43.650
But what we can do
with these crystals

00:40:43.650 --> 00:40:47.950
is use them to do
some polarimetry.

00:40:47.950 --> 00:40:52.020
So one of the things that
you'll know about your-- so

00:40:52.020 --> 00:40:55.980
I said you're going to
make some white crystals.

00:40:55.980 --> 00:40:58.500
So one of the ways that we've
been analyzing our solids

00:40:58.500 --> 00:40:59.790
is by melting point.

00:40:59.790 --> 00:41:02.495
And you can get two
possible diastereomers out

00:41:02.495 --> 00:41:03.245
of this synthesis.

00:41:03.245 --> 00:41:04.995
So you can either
have-- since there's not

00:41:04.995 --> 00:41:07.230
a lot of rotation around
the C-N double bond,

00:41:07.230 --> 00:41:10.350
you either have that extra
nitrogen group pointing up

00:41:10.350 --> 00:41:13.760
towards this methyl
group or away from it.

00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:16.010
And these two compounds have
different melting points.

00:41:16.010 --> 00:41:18.612
So you will characterize
your crystals

00:41:18.612 --> 00:41:20.820
by melting point to figure
out which of these isomers

00:41:20.820 --> 00:41:22.780
you have, the alpha or the beta.

00:41:22.780 --> 00:41:25.020
Most people will make
the beta, because it

00:41:25.020 --> 00:41:26.610
has less steric
hindrance, so it's

00:41:26.610 --> 00:41:29.460
a little bit easier for that
to happen, just synthetically.

00:41:29.460 --> 00:41:31.538
And so that's one
of the first ways

00:41:31.538 --> 00:41:33.330
that you will characterize
these compounds.

00:41:33.330 --> 00:41:35.910
And the second way
is by polarimetry.

00:41:35.910 --> 00:41:43.770
And so if we talk
about polarized light

00:41:43.770 --> 00:41:48.847
really fast, so what does it
mean for light to be polarized?

00:41:52.050 --> 00:41:53.800
It's all going in
the same direction.

00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:58.193
And so all-- so you have a light
source, and it emits light.

00:41:58.193 --> 00:41:59.610
And all of the
waves are traveling

00:41:59.610 --> 00:42:00.952
in all different directions.

00:42:00.952 --> 00:42:02.910
But you can put it through
a polarizing filter,

00:42:02.910 --> 00:42:05.030
and then you only filter
out the light that is--

00:42:05.030 --> 00:42:08.490
that has, like, the molecules
are all arranged in slits

00:42:08.490 --> 00:42:13.570
so that it only selects for
light traveling in one plane.

00:42:13.570 --> 00:42:15.820
So you can put that there.

00:42:15.820 --> 00:42:18.440
And if you-- if I have two
pieces of polarizing paper,

00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:20.940
and I put them on top of each
other in the same orientation,

00:42:20.940 --> 00:42:22.260
then the light pretty
much gets through.

00:42:22.260 --> 00:42:24.302
These are a little bit
colored, so not all of it.

00:42:24.302 --> 00:42:27.030
But then, if I rotate so that
the bottom one is selecting

00:42:27.030 --> 00:42:30.360
for light going this way,
and the top one is selecting

00:42:30.360 --> 00:42:31.860
for light going the
other direction,

00:42:31.860 --> 00:42:36.450
then no light gets
through, because it

00:42:36.450 --> 00:42:38.560
can't pass through the filter.

00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:40.260
So that's what we're
going to-- this

00:42:40.260 --> 00:42:43.110
is the essential principle
behind polarimetry.

00:42:43.110 --> 00:42:47.100
So if you remember from either
your organic chemistry lectures

00:42:47.100 --> 00:42:52.650
or experience before, different
molecules that are chiral

00:42:52.650 --> 00:42:54.898
will rotate plane
polarized light.

00:42:54.898 --> 00:42:56.940
And so what that means is
if you put a polarizing

00:42:56.940 --> 00:42:59.370
filter on your light,
select for light all going

00:42:59.370 --> 00:43:00.870
in one direction,
and then you shine

00:43:00.870 --> 00:43:03.720
that light through
a chiral sample,

00:43:03.720 --> 00:43:07.710
it'll get rotated to a
certain degree based on

00:43:07.710 --> 00:43:10.260
a number of features,
but essentially,

00:43:10.260 --> 00:43:12.820
how the light interacts
with your chiral sample.

00:43:12.820 --> 00:43:16.530
And so if you have two
polarizing filters,

00:43:16.530 --> 00:43:18.540
and you have your
sample in between them,

00:43:18.540 --> 00:43:24.740
you can rotate one of
them, and eventually, it'll

00:43:24.740 --> 00:43:27.510
match up again, and you'll see
all the light come through.

00:43:27.510 --> 00:43:30.052
And so that's how you can tell
how much your compound rotates

00:43:30.052 --> 00:43:30.552
the light.

00:43:30.552 --> 00:43:32.420
So you put a polarizing
filter on each side,

00:43:32.420 --> 00:43:35.365
and then kind of
rotate them until you

00:43:35.365 --> 00:43:36.490
get all of your light back.

00:43:36.490 --> 00:43:37.870
And then, you can
measure the polarimetry.

00:43:37.870 --> 00:43:40.328
So that's kind of the way that
they did it in the old days,

00:43:40.328 --> 00:43:43.570
but we have an instrument
that'll do it for you.

00:43:43.570 --> 00:43:47.020
So you don't have to
worry about that too much.

00:43:47.020 --> 00:43:48.520
I'll turn this back
on really quick.

00:43:51.810 --> 00:43:53.940
But the rotation, like I
said, we can measure it.

00:43:53.940 --> 00:43:55.420
And it's characteristic
of the molecules.

00:43:55.420 --> 00:43:57.970
So the R and the S forms will
rotate in opposite directions.

00:43:57.970 --> 00:43:59.640
So in our case,
the R form rotates

00:43:59.640 --> 00:44:02.730
light in the negative
direction, or counterclockwise,

00:44:02.730 --> 00:44:05.460
and then the S form
will rotate light

00:44:05.460 --> 00:44:06.630
in the positive direction.

00:44:06.630 --> 00:44:09.397
And the R and the S
are not really related

00:44:09.397 --> 00:44:10.480
to the plus and the minus.

00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:14.400
So for different compounds,
the R might be the plus isomer

00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:15.780
and the S might be the minus.

00:44:15.780 --> 00:44:17.447
It's something that
you have to measure.

00:44:17.447 --> 00:44:20.520
You can't just know off
the top of your head.

00:44:20.520 --> 00:44:23.070
And from this, we can
calculate the specific rotation

00:44:23.070 --> 00:44:25.947
of our light, which is how
much the light has rotated.

00:44:25.947 --> 00:44:28.530
And it depends on the length of
the sample, the concentration,

00:44:28.530 --> 00:44:30.180
and the wavelengths
of light that is used,

00:44:30.180 --> 00:44:31.300
and then, again,
the temperature,

00:44:31.300 --> 00:44:33.342
because that impacts the
density of your solution

00:44:33.342 --> 00:44:34.175
or of your compound.

00:44:34.175 --> 00:44:36.259
So the way that you're
going to do this in the lab

00:44:36.259 --> 00:44:38.730
is you're going to take a
sample of your crystals,

00:44:38.730 --> 00:44:39.720
and then you're going
to weigh them out,

00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:41.430
and you're going to
dissolve them in ethanol.

00:44:41.430 --> 00:44:42.847
So you're going
to make a solution

00:44:42.847 --> 00:44:44.700
that you know the
concentration of so

00:44:44.700 --> 00:44:48.880
that we can plug that in
for our concentration.

00:44:48.880 --> 00:44:51.715
And you will put
it in these tubes.

00:44:51.715 --> 00:44:54.090
And then you will insert the
tube into the polar emitter,

00:44:54.090 --> 00:44:55.110
and it will shine
the light through.

00:44:55.110 --> 00:44:57.300
And then it will calculate
what the angle is

00:44:57.300 --> 00:44:58.745
that the light gets rotated by.

00:44:58.745 --> 00:45:00.120
And the polarimeter
actually will

00:45:00.120 --> 00:45:03.150
calculate the specific rotation
for you, which is kind of nice.

00:45:03.150 --> 00:45:05.205
But you can also calculate it.

00:45:05.205 --> 00:45:07.580
It gives you all the information
to calculate it yourself

00:45:07.580 --> 00:45:08.970
as well.

00:45:08.970 --> 00:45:12.440
So this is notated
very similarly

00:45:12.440 --> 00:45:16.040
to our refractive index,
in that it is taken

00:45:16.040 --> 00:45:17.325
at 20 degrees for the density.

00:45:17.325 --> 00:45:18.950
And we use the same
wavelength of light

00:45:18.950 --> 00:45:21.560
from that sodium D-line,
the 586 nanometers,

00:45:21.560 --> 00:45:23.730
in order to have a
consistent representation.

00:45:23.730 --> 00:45:26.840
So you may see these
constants in the literature.

00:45:26.840 --> 00:45:28.340
And if the temperature
is different,

00:45:28.340 --> 00:45:30.830
it'll say something
like 23 or 25,

00:45:30.830 --> 00:45:32.900
or whatever the temperature
they took it at.

00:45:32.900 --> 00:45:35.570
And you can also change this to
whatever nanometer wavelength

00:45:35.570 --> 00:45:36.845
of light that you used.

00:45:36.845 --> 00:45:38.720
But we're going to be
using these conditions.

00:45:38.720 --> 00:45:41.900
And then this is the rotation
of the light in degrees,

00:45:41.900 --> 00:45:43.640
the length the travels
in decimeters--

00:45:43.640 --> 00:45:45.473
so you're going to
measure the tube that you

00:45:45.473 --> 00:45:47.810
use in decimeters-- and then
your concentration in grams

00:45:47.810 --> 00:45:48.260
per milliliter.

00:45:48.260 --> 00:45:50.052
And you can calculate
the specific rotation

00:45:50.052 --> 00:45:53.670
of the molecules.

00:45:53.670 --> 00:45:56.060
So hopefully, the people
who had different isomers

00:45:56.060 --> 00:45:58.160
will rotate-- the light
will get rotated exactly

00:45:58.160 --> 00:46:02.100
in the same number of degrees,
but in opposite directions

00:46:02.100 --> 00:46:04.100
if we've done
everything correctly.

00:46:04.100 --> 00:46:07.500
So you'll see what you
can get from there.

00:46:07.500 --> 00:46:09.060
And I think that
is all for today.

00:46:09.060 --> 00:46:11.090
Do you guys have any
questions about anything

00:46:11.090 --> 00:46:13.132
that we are about to do
in the essential oil lab?

00:46:13.132 --> 00:46:14.960
Autumn?

00:46:14.960 --> 00:46:19.780
AUDIENCE: Why is-- in this
case, why is gas [INAUDIBLE]??

00:46:19.780 --> 00:46:24.420
SARAH HEWETT: In this case,
to be perfectly honest,

00:46:24.420 --> 00:46:26.760
I am not super
familiar with HPLC.

00:46:26.760 --> 00:46:31.400
I'm sure you could also use it
to separate these compounds.

00:46:31.400 --> 00:46:34.020
GC is-- I mean, part
of it is the techniques

00:46:34.020 --> 00:46:35.650
that we have available to us.

00:46:35.650 --> 00:46:36.690
So there's that.

00:46:36.690 --> 00:46:38.580
But this also gets
separated really nicely

00:46:38.580 --> 00:46:39.580
based on boiling point.

00:46:39.580 --> 00:46:41.372
So it's kind of fast
and easy for us to do.

00:46:41.372 --> 00:46:43.860
But I can also-- yeah, we
can talk about it more.

00:46:43.860 --> 00:46:46.340
Yeah, no, it's a good question.

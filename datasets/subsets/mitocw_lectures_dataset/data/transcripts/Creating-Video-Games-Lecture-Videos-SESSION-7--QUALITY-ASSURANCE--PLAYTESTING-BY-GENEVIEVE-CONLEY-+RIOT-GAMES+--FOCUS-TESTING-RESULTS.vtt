00:00:23.157 --> 00:00:23.740
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:24.600
Welcome to class.

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:31.100
The theme of today's lecture
is all about testing.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:35.010
So I'm going to give the
intro to testing lecture

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.270
where I talk about testing
and how, what it is,

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:39.026
and why we do it.

00:00:39.026 --> 00:00:40.400
Give you some
basic testing tips,

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.733
and let you know what we
expect you to be doing in terms

00:00:42.733 --> 00:00:44.710
of testing for your projects.

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.016
And I'll spend a little
more time on focus testing,

00:00:48.016 --> 00:00:49.890
because that's the part
people are frequently

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.660
least familiar with.

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:54.380
We have Genevieve
Conley from Riot,

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:58.150
and she's going to give a
lecture related to testing.

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.160
But more about what Riot's
doing and stuff like that.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.270
So hopefully that will be fun.

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.590
We'll take a break.

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:06.847
And then since we just
told you all about testing

00:01:06.847 --> 00:01:09.430
and how important it is, we will
go ahead and run a focus test

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.634
in class.

00:01:11.634 --> 00:01:13.550
We'll give you some time
to get things set up,

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:15.770
probably about 10 minutes
to plan your test.

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.920
Then we'll set things up
and we will run testing.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.020
We're going to ask that everyone
on your team test at least

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.010
two games and that
everyone on your team

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:29.770
observe at least one
person playing a game.

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.880
How exactly you're going to
make all of that happen in flow

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.636
is your problem.

00:01:36.636 --> 00:01:37.760
And then we will come down.

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.640
We'll give you some time to let
your team compare observations

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.440
and talk about
results, and then we'll

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.670
ask you to come down for
a standard in class, two

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.640
minute no visuals presentation.

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:54.250
Monday, project two is due
along with your design change

00:01:54.250 --> 00:02:00.920
log and focus test reports
and your individual write-ups,

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.560
and the project
two presentation.

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.030
This is a five
minute presentation.

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:05.904
There are presentation
guidelines on Stellar.

00:02:05.904 --> 00:02:07.940
You can download
and look at them.

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:09.470
Once again, we're
primarily looking

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.105
for postmortem and reflection.

00:02:11.105 --> 00:02:12.686
We want to hear
about your process.

00:02:12.686 --> 00:02:14.060
We want to know
what you learned.

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.850
We want to know what you did
right, what you did wrong,

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:17.650
and what you're going
to do in the future.

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.460
And we want it in five minutes.

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:28.220
Grades for project one are
up, along with comments

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.820
about your individual
postmortems

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:34.450
and some comments about
the overall project stuff.

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.850
Overall, we were really
impressed with the quality

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:38.290
of project one.

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.700
So keep it up.

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.620
But do you stop and
read the comments

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.200
so that you guys
can make sure to do

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.540
good jobs on your individual
postmortems going forward.

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.550
Anything to add?

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:54.100
All right.

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:58.180
So people say testing.

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:59.630
People say quality assurance.

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:01.161
What are they?

00:03:01.161 --> 00:03:03.285
Quality assurance is actually
just a whole process.

00:03:03.285 --> 00:03:05.570
It involves a whole lot of
different types of testing.

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:11.140
But in general, it's
the systematic process

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.360
checking to see whether
a product of service

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.290
being developed is meeting
its specified requirements.

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.190
The most important
part of that definition

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.500
really is systemic,
which means you're doing

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.690
regular, repeatable testing.

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:27.710
Looking at making sure that
all the portions of your game

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:28.920
or project are working.

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.660
And requirements,
making sure you're

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.700
meeting that it
doesn't just "work"

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.310
as far as you think it does.

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:38.370
It works according the
requirements of the game,

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.760
of the project, of
whoever you're shipping

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.010
to and et cetera and so forth.

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.887
So you need to know what
your standards are to be

00:03:44.887 --> 00:03:46.095
doing good quality assurance.

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:53.940
Without testing, your
project will fail,

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.350
and will take more time, and
will take a lot more effort.

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:59.740
You can make games
without programmers.

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:02.702
There's a lot of graphical user
interface engines out there.

00:04:02.702 --> 00:04:04.410
Some of them are
getting older and older,

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.201
but they're out there
and you can use them.

00:04:06.201 --> 00:04:07.190
GameMaker, for example.

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:08.350
You can make games
without artists.

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:09.891
I bet several of
you are figuring out

00:04:09.891 --> 00:04:11.330
how to do that right now.

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:13.680
But you can also
make games completely

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.890
without assets using text
engines like Inform 7.

00:04:19.184 --> 00:04:21.600
You don't really need designated
producer or distinct game

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.290
designer on a small team.

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:25.500
One person can
really do it alone.

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.790
But you're never going to make
a good game without testing,

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:31.690
and the more
systemic and planned

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:34.890
your testing is, the
more results you'll

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:36.210
get from less effort.

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:44.020
So who gets to do
all this testing?

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.960
That's really everyone
involved in the project.

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.330
Do not assume that
because you are

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:51.100
the key programmer
or the key designer

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:54.510
or the key whatever that someone
else will check your code

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:58.290
and make sure it's working
after you've integrated it.

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:00.170
You really want
everyone on the team

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:01.940
to consider it to be
their responsibility

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:04.320
to keep the game working
as well as possible

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:07.120
all the way through, and
also to take the time

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.180
to go in and check
other people's stuff

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:12.080
to make sure that it went in.

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:16.090
Remember that this is one of
the cornerstones of using Scrum

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:18.990
as well, where before a
task is actually done,

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:20.800
someone else has gone
in and verified it.

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.300
Well, someone else is going to
be someone on the team, which

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:26.620
means you're all going to have
allot some time to doing it,

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:28.940
and you're going to have
to think about that.

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:32.870
Speaking of which, anybody have
testing as one of your tasks

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:34.163
on your sprint task list?

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:39.680
Anybody?

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.960
Woo, you win.

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:43.340
It's going to take some time.

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:45.800
And it's going to take some
time that probably otherwise

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:48.210
could be used for making code.

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:49.720
So go ahead and
remember that now

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:51.219
and think about
that as you're going

00:05:51.219 --> 00:05:53.560
into your last week
of work, that you need

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:57.070
to allot some time for testing.

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:58.566
So types of testing.

00:05:58.566 --> 00:05:59.940
What is the
terminology I'm going

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:04.550
to use so that we all understand
what I'm saying when I say it?

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:08.230
I divide testing up
into three major areas,

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:14.240
and there isn't a lot of formal
methodology on this, especially

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:15.930
not in the game industry.

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:19.170
So I tend to talk about
technical testing, play

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:21.760
testing, and user testing.

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:27.740
When I say technical testing, I
mean getting your game to run.

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:29.910
Specifically, I often
mean getting your game

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:33.070
to run exactly as how
you intended it to run.

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:39.940
So if the designer claims that
the peach mobile should go up

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:42.910
to 30 miles per hour and fire
eight peaches per second,

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:44.630
if you go into the
game and you discover

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:46.500
that it goes 70 miles
per hour and fires

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:48.820
two peaches per
second, that's not

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:52.140
working even if it makes game
awfully fun with it like that.

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:58.047
When you start thinking
about whether it's fun or not

00:06:58.047 --> 00:07:00.380
as a developer, then you're
moving into the area of play

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:02.980
testing which is
where you, the team,

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:05.200
are playing your game
trying to figure out,

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:08.622
hey, all those requirements and
constraints and plans we made,

00:07:08.622 --> 00:07:09.330
are they working?

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:12.886
And are they working well, and
is a player going to enjoy it?

00:07:12.886 --> 00:07:14.760
You're play testing your
game as a developer.

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:16.343
You're checking to
make sure it works.

00:07:16.343 --> 00:07:17.140
In that case, yes.

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:18.931
The fact that the peach
mobile is currently

00:07:18.931 --> 00:07:23.250
going 30 miles per hour and it's
so slow that no player is ever

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:25.100
going to want to use it.

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:25.850
That's a bug.

00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:27.230
That's a really big bug.

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:29.509
But it's a play testing
bug if your specs say

00:07:29.509 --> 00:07:31.050
it should be going
30 miles per hour,

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:32.370
not a technical testing bug.

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:34.940
And it is good to know the
differences so that you

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:36.650
can know what
you're talking about

00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:38.640
and why you're talking about it.

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:41.840
Finally, there's
user testing, which

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:44.800
is getting someone who is not
on your team to play your game.

00:07:47.104 --> 00:07:49.020
You, the developer, while
you do play testing,

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:50.500
can pretend to be
an actual player.

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:52.110
But you are not
an actual player.

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:54.400
You will never be an actual
player for your game.

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:55.790
You know it too well.

00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:57.380
You are too close to it.

00:07:57.380 --> 00:07:59.270
You have spent too
many hours playing it.

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:04.860
So you really need to
get someone who has never

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:07.360
seen your game before, ideally,
to come in and sit down

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:09.456
in front of your
game and play it.

00:08:09.456 --> 00:08:11.830
We're going to make pretend
when we run our focus testing

00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:16.360
workshop that your classmates
here are actually good testers.

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:18.270
Tell you a secret, they're not.

00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:20.917
They've seen your game because
they've play tested it before.

00:08:20.917 --> 00:08:22.250
They've heard you talk about it.

00:08:22.250 --> 00:08:23.380
They heard you pitch it.

00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:25.860
They might even have worked
on it if they switched teams.

00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:27.740
So they're not actually
your ideal testers,

00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:29.350
but they are very
convenient testers.

00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:31.010
So we're going to
use them today.

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:32.570
And for your next
projects, we're

00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:34.240
going to encourage
you-- and, in fact,

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:36.510
require you-- to go out
into the cold, cold world

00:08:36.510 --> 00:08:39.850
and find actual testers
who haven't seen your game.

00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:40.799
People in your dorms.

00:08:40.799 --> 00:08:42.007
People in your other classes.

00:08:42.007 --> 00:08:44.860
Friends, people at
the coffee shop.

00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:47.030
Whoever you think will do
the best job of giving you

00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:48.071
the information you need.

00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:53.796
User testing is another
one of those terminologies

00:08:53.796 --> 00:08:55.460
that means a whole lot.

00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:57.930
So for my convenience,
I tend to divide it

00:08:57.930 --> 00:09:00.680
up into two kinds of things,
focus testing and "user

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:02.000
testing."

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.750
Where "focus testing"
is specifically

00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:05.958
when you're sitting down
and you're playing the game,

00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:07.120
looking at how it plays.

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:07.882
Is it fun?

00:09:07.882 --> 00:09:08.840
Are people enjoying it?

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:09.881
Is it challenging enough?

00:09:09.881 --> 00:09:12.320
Are the mechanics interesting?

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:15.410
Is your game a good game, and
getting that information back

00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:16.700
from your players.

00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:19.940
When user testing,
I tend to use more

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:22.640
for looking at the
usability of your game.

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:24.690
You may have a really,
really fun game,

00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:26.650
but if it takes your
players 12 minutes

00:09:26.650 --> 00:09:29.450
to get off your starting page
because they can't figure out

00:09:29.450 --> 00:09:31.670
what they're doing
or how to do it,

00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:33.990
that's a pretty serious
usability issue.

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:37.040
And you need to figure
that out as well.

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:41.035
So just so you know that those
are those two user types.

00:09:41.035 --> 00:09:43.460
It's all user
testing, but having

00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:48.010
some granularity to find the
difference is a little useful.

00:09:48.010 --> 00:09:51.020
So the basics for technical
testing, which hopefully we

00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:54.040
can go through pretty quickly.

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:56.830
I suspect that if you guys
have done programming,

00:09:56.830 --> 00:09:57.830
you've done this before.

00:09:57.830 --> 00:09:59.955
If you've had classes that
wanted code that worked,

00:09:59.955 --> 00:10:03.420
hopefully they've helped teach
you what the good things to do

00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:04.490
are.

00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:07.610
A lot of this sounds an
awful lot like good software

00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:10.160
practices lecture
that Andrew gave,

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:13.440
because a lot of good testing
is, in fact, a good software

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:14.190
practice.

00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:18.240
So have some
technical standards.

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:19.350
Have a bug database.

00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:21.140
Or, given the size
of these projects,

00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:24.620
at least a bug Excel spreadsheet
with a list of everything

00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:26.320
that you've noticed.

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:28.130
Build and test before
checking it in.

00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:29.110
Have daily builds.

00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:32.190
Have a daily play-through.

00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:33.910
Planned feature cuts.

00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:34.760
Scope.

00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:36.960
When you realize that you're
not getting everything

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:41.550
done on Friday night as
you're working on your game,

00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:43.410
start cutting then.

00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:46.050
Don't wait until
Sunday night to decide

00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:47.540
what you're going to cut.

00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:50.980
Cut as soon as you realize that
you're blowing your estimates.

00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:53.380
That will allow you
to choose what you cut

00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:55.700
and to adjust
changes in your game

00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:57.980
to reflect the things you cut.

00:10:57.980 --> 00:11:00.260
It will also mean
that testing your game

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:03.560
to make sure-- it will
introduce a lot fewer bugs

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:06.280
when you do it in a controlled
manner than when you do it

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:10.700
in desperation, which is
why I put it under testing.

00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:13.030
Finally, code freezes
and asset freezes.

00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:14.612
These are great,
and no one likes

00:11:14.612 --> 00:11:16.070
to use them because
it means you're

00:11:16.070 --> 00:11:20.060
going to waste an entire day
not working on your game.

00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:21.809
Who wants to do that?

00:11:21.809 --> 00:11:24.100
On the other hand, has anybody
here turned in a project

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:26.750
that they've made a last
minute change to Sunday night,

00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:29.245
it was due Monday morning,
and then it didn't run at all?

00:11:32.472 --> 00:11:33.930
I got some honest
people out there.

00:11:33.930 --> 00:11:35.860
Good.

00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:38.255
The advantage of taking that
whole day to test your game

00:11:38.255 --> 00:11:42.926
is you turn something
in that works on Monday.

00:11:42.926 --> 00:11:44.300
Often, you turn
in something that

00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:46.217
works a lot better on
Monday because you've

00:11:46.217 --> 00:11:47.300
taken the time to test it.

00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:48.460
You've found the bugs.

00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:50.970
You've had a friend help you
review your code changes,

00:11:50.970 --> 00:11:52.760
and you really got it working.

00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:56.950
If you want to make a
good, polished, solid game,

00:11:56.950 --> 00:11:59.630
you will think about
it and give yourself

00:11:59.630 --> 00:12:02.440
a cushion for project two.

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:03.760
That's probably maybe a day.

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:04.760
It's a two week project.

00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:06.801
If you give yourself much
more cushion than that,

00:12:06.801 --> 00:12:08.600
you're not actually
working on it.

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:11.270
But actively give
yourself that deadline

00:12:11.270 --> 00:12:13.930
and give yourself some
time to play your game.

00:12:18.030 --> 00:12:20.070
So that's the basics.

00:12:20.070 --> 00:12:22.370
Some advanced tips.

00:12:22.370 --> 00:12:23.610
It's all pretty simple.

00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:25.460
I think you've all
heard this all.

00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:28.084
How we maintain
your feature list.

00:12:28.084 --> 00:12:29.750
Agree on how features
are going to work,

00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:31.536
so talk with each other.

00:12:31.536 --> 00:12:33.285
Test those features
as soon as they go in.

00:12:36.064 --> 00:12:37.730
This may not be worth
it on these games,

00:12:37.730 --> 00:12:39.000
because they're small.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.860
When you hit your
project four game,

00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:42.840
you may want to
have one of these.

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:45.420
Think about having a
standardized test plan that

00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:48.470
runs through all the buttons
and the branches and the pages

00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:50.890
and the options of your game.

00:12:50.890 --> 00:12:52.660
I realize that when
you've got randomness

00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:55.160
as one of your
core design goals,

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:57.237
you can't predict how your
game is going to play.

00:12:57.237 --> 00:12:59.320
But you should be able to
take a look at your game

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:01.900
and know most of the states
that it's going to get in.

00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:04.150
And you can create a
checklist that says, hey,

00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:06.275
have we exhausted
all the possibilities

00:13:06.275 --> 00:13:09.810
that a player will encounter?

00:13:09.810 --> 00:13:13.370
Have we tested them all in the
last two builds, yes or no?

00:13:13.370 --> 00:13:14.870
And the answer
should probably there

00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:18.202
be yes because one
of the things that's

00:13:18.202 --> 00:13:19.660
very common with
projects that have

00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:22.520
a lot of highly integrated
systems working together

00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:25.260
and depend on emergent
behavior-- which

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:28.520
is most games-- is you can
introduce a feature over

00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:31.750
here that changes the way that
a feature that you implemented

00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:33.250
two weeks ago works.

00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:36.350
And you'll never know that it
did that until you go through

00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:38.930
and you test and you find that
something that was working

00:13:38.930 --> 00:13:40.530
is now broken.

00:13:40.530 --> 00:13:42.690
So it is worth it
to take the time

00:13:42.690 --> 00:13:44.370
to go back and
check those features

00:13:44.370 --> 00:13:45.760
you know nobody touched.

00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:51.610
Bug reporting.

00:13:51.610 --> 00:13:55.430
Because so many people
are so bad at this,

00:13:55.430 --> 00:13:58.100
I'm going to take the time
with a captured audience

00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:01.200
to tell you how to do it.

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:02.680
Be kind to your
fellow engineers.

00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:05.570
Be kind to yourself, if you
end up getting your own bugs.

00:14:05.570 --> 00:14:09.190
Write good defect
reports and not bad ones.

00:14:09.190 --> 00:14:14.527
Good bugs include what happened,
what should have happened.

00:14:14.527 --> 00:14:16.110
Because it doesn't
do me a lot of good

00:14:16.110 --> 00:14:17.609
if you tell me that
the peach mobile

00:14:17.609 --> 00:14:19.310
is going 30 miles
per hour if I don't

00:14:19.310 --> 00:14:20.393
know why that's a problem.

00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:24.892
How do I reproduce it?

00:14:24.892 --> 00:14:27.350
If it's obvious to reproduce,
you don't need to include it.

00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:31.470
But if it took 38 steps,
include a text file.

00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:32.440
How common is the bug?

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:33.850
How serious is the bug?

00:14:33.850 --> 00:14:36.480
Is this something that the team
needs to jump on right now,

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:39.250
or is this something that
Sunday afternoon you're

00:14:39.250 --> 00:14:42.180
going to look at and
say, eh, ship it.

00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:45.159
Because some bugs you look
at and you say, eh, ship it.

00:14:45.159 --> 00:14:46.700
But you want to know
that it's there,

00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:48.480
and you want to
know how it's going

00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:53.385
to affect your game before
you just decide to ship it.

00:14:53.385 --> 00:14:55.760
Include some supporting data
if it's going to be helpful,

00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:56.540
and it often is.

00:14:56.540 --> 00:14:58.540
If you're trying to
describe something visually,

00:14:58.540 --> 00:15:00.620
give them a screenshot.

00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:02.160
If you can run it
in the debugger

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:05.820
and catch some
debugging code, great.

00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:06.610
Save the files.

00:15:06.610 --> 00:15:08.930
Know the version of the
game you were using.

00:15:08.930 --> 00:15:10.650
Be ready to help
your team member who

00:15:10.650 --> 00:15:13.510
has to fix your horrible awful
crash that happens one out

00:15:13.510 --> 00:15:17.970
of every four times, and you're
not sure how you made it.

00:15:17.970 --> 00:15:19.920
Be willing to help
them recreate it,

00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:23.680
because it can be really
hard to recreate bugs.

00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:28.310
Finally, know the difference
between a criticism

00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:32.000
and a critique, and make
sure that your reports are

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.050
critiques of the
game and the bugs

00:15:35.050 --> 00:15:38.610
and not criticisms of
your fellow developers

00:15:38.610 --> 00:15:40.080
and their ideas.

00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:42.420
And when I say criticism,
what I mean here

00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:44.915
is an unsupported
opinion usually delivered

00:15:44.915 --> 00:15:47.030
in an unprofessional tone.

00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:50.160
These purple elephants are
junk and it's totally stupid

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:52.940
that they fly.

00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:55.270
A critique is a
statement of opinion

00:15:55.270 --> 00:15:59.400
about the game backed up by
examples and hopefully facts.

00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:02.280
The purple elephants
make the game too easy

00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:03.500
because they can fly.

00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:06.490
I can skip almost a
third of the game play

00:16:06.490 --> 00:16:08.330
in the bottom area
of the screen.

00:16:08.330 --> 00:16:09.250
There's a problem.

00:16:09.250 --> 00:16:10.810
There's a reason
why it's a problem.

00:16:10.810 --> 00:16:13.107
And there's a fact that
you can talk about,

00:16:13.107 --> 00:16:14.190
and you can have opinions.

00:16:14.190 --> 00:16:17.241
And it doesn't matter that the
purple elephants go in the game

00:16:17.241 --> 00:16:17.740
or not.

00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:20.170
You can just talk about what
they're doing in the game.

00:16:20.170 --> 00:16:21.961
You don't have to talk
about the person who

00:16:21.961 --> 00:16:24.670
put the purple elephants
in the game at all.

00:16:27.490 --> 00:16:29.080
So user testing.

00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:31.790
I think we've actually
covered this one to death.

00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:35.370
But if I did a
lecture about testing

00:16:35.370 --> 00:16:37.630
and didn't stop and talk
about why you're doing it,

00:16:37.630 --> 00:16:39.420
it would be a little odd.

00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:42.530
Once again, every time we
say iterative design, that

00:16:42.530 --> 00:16:45.720
means you make a design, you
test it, you get the data,

00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:48.300
you move on without actually
testing it with users.

00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:52.140
You don't get real data,
et cetera and so forth.

00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:54.840
So I think that drum has
been well and truly beaten.

00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:57.320
But here's a warning
we haven't really

00:16:57.320 --> 00:17:01.980
talked about yet, which
is test-driven design.

00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:05.960
Does not mean do what your
testers tell you to do.

00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:09.790
Test-driven design means
gather data from your testers,

00:17:09.790 --> 00:17:13.420
analyze it, and act on it.

00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:15.530
90% of all MIT
students will tell you

00:17:15.530 --> 00:17:18.440
that your game is too easy.

00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:20.490
They're wrong.

00:17:20.490 --> 00:17:23.000
90% of all people who like
to play first person shooters

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.089
will tell you that
your game needs a gun.

00:17:26.089 --> 00:17:28.310
If you didn't plan on
having a gun in your game,

00:17:28.310 --> 00:17:32.350
it probably really
doesn't need a gun.

00:17:32.350 --> 00:17:34.722
Testers are often full of
solutions and suggestions

00:17:34.722 --> 00:17:36.430
to make your game just
like the game they

00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:37.554
wish they were playing.

00:17:37.554 --> 00:17:39.220
But you're not trying
to make that game.

00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:41.930
You're trying to make the
game you're trying to make.

00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:44.540
So when you gather
your data, put it

00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:47.270
through the filter of what
your vision of the game is

00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:49.250
and what you intend
your game to do,

00:17:49.250 --> 00:17:52.140
and don't let your
testers drive your game.

00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:57.240
Let your vision and
your data drive it.

00:17:57.240 --> 00:17:58.390
So how.

00:17:58.390 --> 00:17:59.952
How do you get
ideas from testers?

00:17:59.952 --> 00:18:02.285
And how do you actually turn
them into something useful?

00:18:05.327 --> 00:18:07.160
So you all remember the
experimental method.

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:08.810
It's actually really
pretty similar.

00:18:08.810 --> 00:18:13.050
Going to form a hypothesis,
or ask a question.

00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:15.250
Figure out how to get the
data to that question,

00:18:15.250 --> 00:18:17.340
collect it, and analyze it.

00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:18.790
So forming a question.

00:18:18.790 --> 00:18:20.740
What do you need to
know about your game

00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:23.280
that your team can't answer?

00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:26.530
The more specific you
can be, the easier it is.

00:18:26.530 --> 00:18:28.450
Sometimes it is
hard to get specific

00:18:28.450 --> 00:18:29.340
because you've got
a game and you've

00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:30.740
got a whole lot of
interlinking systems,

00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:32.989
and it's hard to figure out
which one is making things

00:18:32.989 --> 00:18:33.870
not quite right.

00:18:33.870 --> 00:18:35.420
But do your best.

00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:37.310
In there a particular mechanic?

00:18:37.310 --> 00:18:39.650
Are people having a hard
time or an easy time

00:18:39.650 --> 00:18:41.732
getting started on your game?

00:18:41.732 --> 00:18:43.440
How engaged are people
in your game play?

00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:45.065
Are they playing the
game and grinning,

00:18:45.065 --> 00:18:47.844
or are they just sitting
there and hitting the keys?

00:18:47.844 --> 00:18:49.635
How many of your players
complete your game

00:18:49.635 --> 00:18:51.260
in about the time
you expected them to?

00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:56.870
How many of them complete
too quickly or take too long?

00:18:56.870 --> 00:18:59.150
So when you're running
scientific experiments,

00:18:59.150 --> 00:19:00.800
you try to standardize
your conditions

00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:02.860
as much as possible
to get data that can

00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:06.300
be compared with each other.

00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:09.080
When you're collecting
qualitative data, which

00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:10.980
is what most focus
testing data is,

00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:12.730
this is actually pretty
hard to do but you

00:19:12.730 --> 00:19:15.040
want to try to do it anyway.

00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:20.060
So some of the ways
you can do that is by

00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:22.760
make sure you're giving each
player the same set of starting

00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:25.716
information by having a
script to introduce your game,

00:19:25.716 --> 00:19:27.840
to give them any information
about the game they're

00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:30.600
going to need because your game
is in too early to have a UI.

00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:32.590
Games often don't
have UIs that are

00:19:32.590 --> 00:19:35.950
particularly useful while
they want to be tested early.

00:19:35.950 --> 00:19:39.780
That's OK, just tell your
players what your UI "should"

00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:41.414
tell them.

00:19:41.414 --> 00:19:43.080
You can double this
up with user testing

00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:45.970
by giving them pictures
of the intended UI,

00:19:45.970 --> 00:19:48.210
and you can see if they can
figure it out from there

00:19:48.210 --> 00:19:48.710
or not.

00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:51.730
But that's advanced
testing tricks.

00:19:51.730 --> 00:19:53.725
Have a dedicated observer.

00:19:53.725 --> 00:19:56.100
Don't depend on their memory
for what they're looking for

00:19:56.100 --> 00:19:58.060
or what they see.

00:19:58.060 --> 00:19:59.530
Give them a list
of specific things

00:19:59.530 --> 00:20:01.980
to look for that you think
will answer the questions

00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:03.290
you need to answer.

00:20:03.290 --> 00:20:05.500
Give them space to
write it down with.

00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:07.980
And give them the
autonomy to stand back

00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:10.270
and just take notes
while someone else

00:20:10.270 --> 00:20:15.520
offers your player assistance
or introduces them to the game.

00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:18.680
And finally, you really
can't observe everything.

00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:22.550
Think about what your players
might be able to tell you

00:20:22.550 --> 00:20:23.902
that you can't see.

00:20:23.902 --> 00:20:25.360
Write down a few
questions for them

00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:27.470
to answer afterwards
if you need to.

00:20:27.470 --> 00:20:28.370
Keep it short.

00:20:28.370 --> 00:20:30.578
You don't really want to
make somebody write an essay

00:20:30.578 --> 00:20:33.250
while they do your testing.

00:20:33.250 --> 00:20:36.145
If you can encourage your
players to talk to the game

00:20:36.145 --> 00:20:38.300
or to talk out loud
while they play,

00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:42.680
that's the greatest thing ever.

00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:44.920
The best people I've
ever heard play games

00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:50.120
are middle schoolers because
they connect their brain

00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:52.660
straight to their mouth
without any filter,

00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:53.685
and they're just there.

00:20:53.685 --> 00:20:55.310
They're telling you
what they're doing.

00:20:55.310 --> 00:20:56.490
They're telling you
why they're doing it.

00:20:56.490 --> 00:20:58.948
They're telling you why this
particular aspect of your game

00:20:58.948 --> 00:21:01.590
is the worst thing ever, or
why this particular aspect

00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:04.340
of your game is the
greatest thing ever.

00:21:04.340 --> 00:21:06.970
And you can just sit
there and listen to them

00:21:06.970 --> 00:21:08.920
and you know why
they're doing things.

00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:10.165
Adults are a lot quieter.

00:21:10.165 --> 00:21:12.540
We often don't want to explain
why we're doing something.

00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:15.210
Often it's because we don't
know we're supposed to be doing.

00:21:15.210 --> 00:21:17.420
And we don't want to admit that
I don't know what I'm doing.

00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:19.378
I'm just going to poke
stuff until I figure out

00:21:19.378 --> 00:21:21.580
what's going on.

00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:23.680
So that's where you
want to watch people.

00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:27.190
And if you really need
to, you can lead and say,

00:21:27.190 --> 00:21:29.160
why did you do that thing?

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:32.432
Or even better, what
are you thinking?

00:21:32.432 --> 00:21:34.140
People will often
answer those questions.

00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:35.889
But you really want
to keep those prodding

00:21:35.889 --> 00:21:37.550
questions neutral.

00:21:37.550 --> 00:21:40.140
Don't say, why did you
do that crazy thing?

00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:43.160
Or, what are you
looking for back there?

00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:44.990
But just, what are you thinking?

00:21:44.990 --> 00:21:47.240
What are you doing?

00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:50.090
What's your plan?

00:21:50.090 --> 00:21:51.650
That sort of thing.

00:21:51.650 --> 00:21:53.670
Once you've got
your data the team

00:21:53.670 --> 00:21:57.470
can review it together to notice
trends, spot common problems,

00:21:57.470 --> 00:21:58.290
and so on.

00:21:58.290 --> 00:22:01.950
And that's where the things
that four or five or a majority

00:22:01.950 --> 00:22:05.555
of your testers did or
said or ran into, that's

00:22:05.555 --> 00:22:07.430
what you're going to be
pulling out and using

00:22:07.430 --> 00:22:10.030
to think about how you're
going to fix those problems.

00:22:10.030 --> 00:22:12.380
Or if you noticed a trend
that you hadn't noticed before

00:22:12.380 --> 00:22:14.250
that people were really
liking an aspect of your game

00:22:14.250 --> 00:22:15.990
you haven't thought
about, it's something

00:22:15.990 --> 00:22:18.300
you can work on magnifying
so that you can share it

00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:18.900
with everyone.

00:22:22.340 --> 00:22:26.230
So for those of you who fell
asleep while I was talking,

00:22:26.230 --> 00:22:28.860
the too long didn't
read version really

00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:32.250
is who are you testing with,
because your audience will

00:22:32.250 --> 00:22:33.920
affect your data.

00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:35.970
What are you testing with?

00:22:35.970 --> 00:22:38.770
The state of your game
will affect your data.

00:22:38.770 --> 00:22:41.952
That shouldn't stop you from
testing with early builds,

00:22:41.952 --> 00:22:44.160
but it does mean you need
to adjust your expectations

00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:46.450
and make sure your players
are ready to play with it.

00:22:49.370 --> 00:22:52.380
And finally, why
are you testing?

00:22:52.380 --> 00:22:54.490
Only you can answer
that question.

00:22:54.490 --> 00:22:57.284
We can give you a lot of
reasons or suggestions,

00:22:57.284 --> 00:22:58.700
but if you're
running a focus test

00:22:58.700 --> 00:23:02.210
it really needs to be because
you're looking for data

00:23:02.210 --> 00:23:05.110
that your team intends to use.

00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:07.240
And you can always use
data to support your game.

00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:07.950
You really can.

00:23:07.950 --> 00:23:10.460
Even if you don't realize
that you need it, you do.

00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:15.420
And I keep saying
"and gather data."

00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:16.990
And I talked about observations.

00:23:16.990 --> 00:23:19.080
I talked about surveys.

00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:23.300
I talked about interviews,
which are our three major tools

00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:28.264
unless you are going to go to
all the work of videotaping

00:23:28.264 --> 00:23:29.930
and audio recording
and getting releases

00:23:29.930 --> 00:23:32.030
from your testers, which
I really don't recommend.

00:23:32.030 --> 00:23:34.550
That's more work than
you should be doing.

00:23:34.550 --> 00:23:36.860
But the three major tools
really are observing people

00:23:36.860 --> 00:23:39.730
and taking notes, asking them
a standard set of questions

00:23:39.730 --> 00:23:42.700
afterwards-- either on
paper or in person--

00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:45.200
and thinking about
what kind of data

00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:50.260
you can gather best with
each of those methods.

00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:52.650
If you have 20 different
levels you want someone

00:23:52.650 --> 00:23:55.369
to rate at a one to five as
to whether it's good or not,

00:23:55.369 --> 00:23:57.035
you should just give
them piece of paper

00:23:57.035 --> 00:23:58.576
and when they finish
each level, they

00:23:58.576 --> 00:24:01.500
can check a number
between one and five.

00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:03.566
If you want to see how
long it takes someone

00:24:03.566 --> 00:24:05.440
to get started playing
the game, you probably

00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:07.700
just want to watch
them with a timer.

00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:10.140
How long does it take them
to get from that first screen

00:24:10.140 --> 00:24:14.820
to getting into the game?

00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:17.287
And finally, if you want to
get a general impression,

00:24:17.287 --> 00:24:19.370
sometimes talking to people
helps bring out things

00:24:19.370 --> 00:24:20.411
that you didn't think of.

00:24:20.411 --> 00:24:22.260
You can get some
insights you wouldn't

00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:24.970
have thought to ask for
by talking with people.

00:24:24.970 --> 00:24:27.219
But be a little careful
talking with people,

00:24:27.219 --> 00:24:28.760
because people don't
want to tell you

00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:30.710
bad things to your face.

00:24:30.710 --> 00:24:33.640
They'd rather write the bad
things down on a piece of paper

00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:35.514
where they don't have
to admit that they said

00:24:35.514 --> 00:24:36.970
bad things about this game.

00:24:36.970 --> 00:24:39.050
That covers less for
middle school students,

00:24:39.050 --> 00:24:42.260
as I mentioned earlier.

00:24:42.260 --> 00:24:44.450
But most people
don't really want

00:24:44.450 --> 00:24:46.860
to say mean things
to the person who

00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:50.040
made the game, because we don't
want to make people feel bad.

00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:51.710
So you need to
balance that out when

00:24:51.710 --> 00:24:53.460
you're asking people
questions about well,

00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:55.810
how did you like the game?

00:24:55.810 --> 00:24:58.171
The answer is usually,
oh, it's great.

00:24:58.171 --> 00:24:58.670
Yeah.

00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:07.010
So having run
through all of that,

00:25:07.010 --> 00:25:08.990
let me fight with my
computer and bring up

00:25:08.990 --> 00:25:09.905
a couple of examples.

00:25:13.630 --> 00:25:16.400
That's not the right form yet.

00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:19.015
So this is a script
created by students

00:25:19.015 --> 00:25:21.620
by a team that had a
dedicated QA lead person.

00:25:24.270 --> 00:25:27.220
I do not expect your sheets
to look anything like this,

00:25:27.220 --> 00:25:29.380
but I want you to see an
example of what someone

00:25:29.380 --> 00:25:32.430
did when it was their job
and they were taking time

00:25:32.430 --> 00:25:33.290
to get things ready.

00:25:33.290 --> 00:25:34.910
So you can see how
serious we are.

00:25:34.910 --> 00:25:38.110
And so you've got your
observer instructions.

00:25:38.110 --> 00:25:40.535
And what's day's goal?

00:25:40.535 --> 00:25:42.160
Finding out if the
feedback in the game

00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:45.540
works, along with a
couple of other things.

00:25:45.540 --> 00:25:47.900
And there's a testing
script written out

00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:51.170
pretty clearly along with
some basic instructions.

00:25:51.170 --> 00:25:56.054
Since these teams had a
dedicated focus test lead,

00:25:56.054 --> 00:25:57.470
they had someone
who'd spent a lot

00:25:57.470 --> 00:25:59.360
of time thinking about
testing and a lot of people

00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:01.360
who'd spend a lot of
time working on the game.

00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:03.730
So the lead tester
was in the position

00:26:03.730 --> 00:26:06.600
of trying to make sure
that the team understood

00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:09.920
how to run tests, because they
weren't experts at it either.

00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:13.290
So I just embedded all
of the good advice right

00:26:13.290 --> 00:26:16.260
into the script.

00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:17.290
And there you have it.

00:26:17.290 --> 00:26:19.400
And then there's a sheet
to write notes down.

00:26:22.740 --> 00:26:26.420
They've got the big questions
that they're worried about,

00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:27.410
so they can write down.

00:26:27.410 --> 00:26:28.826
They've got space
for other notes.

00:26:28.826 --> 00:26:32.240
And it means that whatever
they've got, they've got.

00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:34.590
And then finally, it follows
up with a fairly short

00:26:34.590 --> 00:26:38.680
questionnaire trying to get
some answers to questions

00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:41.926
they're wondering about.

00:26:41.926 --> 00:26:44.300
The specifics are always going
to vary from game to game.

00:26:44.300 --> 00:26:46.175
Looking at the focus
test sheet from one game

00:26:46.175 --> 00:26:48.000
isn't going to help
you wildly with yours.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.270
But you can think about the
way the questions are worded

00:26:51.270 --> 00:26:54.544
and the number of questions
so that you're not

00:26:54.544 --> 00:26:55.335
overloading people.

00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:59.050
I believe these are up
on Stellar as a sample

00:26:59.050 --> 00:27:03.500
if you want to download it
and look at it as an example.

00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:07.200
Finally, the paper
we expect you to do.

00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:11.990
So this is the focus
test report which

00:27:11.990 --> 00:27:13.540
is also download-able
on Stellar,

00:27:13.540 --> 00:27:17.500
I think in either Word or Rich
Text Format so you can use it.

00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:20.027
When we say we expect you to
turn in a focus test report,

00:27:20.027 --> 00:27:21.860
this is what we're
expecting you to turn in.

00:27:21.860 --> 00:27:24.799
If you take a look
at it, it walks you

00:27:24.799 --> 00:27:26.340
through the whole
process and there's

00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:27.770
a space for most of this stuff.

00:27:27.770 --> 00:27:31.430
So what's the goal
of the focus test?

00:27:31.430 --> 00:27:33.750
Record what happened
at the focus test

00:27:33.750 --> 00:27:36.770
and what are you going
to do afterwards.

00:27:36.770 --> 00:27:40.560
When you are planning your focus
test for this afternoon later

00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:44.070
in class, I recommend you
download this and use it

00:27:44.070 --> 00:27:45.640
as your sheet to
record notes on,

00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:50.390
because it'll help make sure
that you get the data that we

00:27:50.390 --> 00:27:53.760
are asking you to get.

00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:57.300
And I think that's
actually most of what

00:27:57.300 --> 00:27:58.610
I have to say about testing.

00:27:58.610 --> 00:27:59.609
Are there any questions?

00:28:03.159 --> 00:28:05.147
PHILLIP TAN: I have a question.

00:28:05.147 --> 00:28:09.620
What's currently using
some bug database,

00:28:09.620 --> 00:28:14.590
and if so, what are
folks currently using?

00:28:14.590 --> 00:28:17.572
Or let me rephrase that.

00:28:17.572 --> 00:28:20.057
Who has used a bug
database before?

00:28:20.057 --> 00:28:23.442
What are some of the ones
that you're familiar with?

00:28:23.442 --> 00:28:24.150
AUDIENCE: Chehra.

00:28:24.150 --> 00:28:26.898
PHILLIP TAN: Chehra?

00:28:26.898 --> 00:28:27.928
AUDIENCE: Bugzilla.

00:28:27.928 --> 00:28:28.886
PHILLIP TAN: Which one?

00:28:28.886 --> 00:28:29.383
AUDIENCE: Bugzilla.

00:28:29.383 --> 00:28:30.466
PHILLIP TAN: Oh, Bugzilla.

00:28:30.466 --> 00:28:31.371
Yeah.

00:28:31.371 --> 00:28:32.512
AUDIENCE: Buganizer.

00:28:32.512 --> 00:28:33.720
PHILLIP TAN: Which one is it?

00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:34.126
AUDIENCE: Buganizer.

00:28:34.126 --> 00:28:35.084
PHILLIP TAN: Buganizer?

00:28:35.084 --> 00:28:35.750
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:37.234
PHILLIP TAN: Oh.

00:28:37.234 --> 00:28:38.472
AUDIENCE: I use [INAUDIBLE].

00:28:38.472 --> 00:28:39.222
PHILLIP TAN: Yeah.

00:28:39.222 --> 00:28:42.982
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] That's
the [INAUDIBLE] database, yeah.

00:28:42.982 --> 00:28:44.440
PHILLIP TAN: And
as Sara mentioned,

00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:47.671
you can also just use a Google
spreadsheet or something.

00:28:47.671 --> 00:28:51.647
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] is
a great bug database too.

00:28:51.647 --> 00:28:54.000
PHILLIP TAN: There is always
this intermediate step

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:57.207
between someone entering
a bug into a bug database

00:28:57.207 --> 00:29:00.490
and then deciding that they're
going to fix it, right?

00:29:00.490 --> 00:29:02.872
So priority, somebody
actually says

00:29:02.872 --> 00:29:06.640
I think the bug that
the characters are

00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:09.142
too short or something,
and then the art director

00:29:09.142 --> 00:29:10.536
says no, not a bug.

00:29:10.536 --> 00:29:13.330
Will not fix that.

00:29:13.330 --> 00:29:17.338
So just because you're entering
something in a bug database

00:29:17.338 --> 00:29:19.462
doesn't necessarily
mean that your team's

00:29:19.462 --> 00:29:21.590
committed to actually
spending time on that.

00:29:21.590 --> 00:29:24.047
But when a team does decide
that, OK, this is a bug.

00:29:24.047 --> 00:29:25.463
Maybe because it
crashes the game.

00:29:25.463 --> 00:29:28.285
Maybe because it's
actually not how

00:29:28.285 --> 00:29:31.120
we want the game to perform.

00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:33.383
It needs to be entered
into your task list.

00:29:33.383 --> 00:29:36.040
So that means your
task list is changing

00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:40.100
and you need to be able
to put that in a priority.

00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:42.028
Possibly, this bug is
more serious than some

00:29:42.028 --> 00:29:44.438
of the planned tasks that
you already have on there.

00:29:44.438 --> 00:29:49.698
So you need to rearrange
that so that [INAUDIBLE].

00:29:49.698 --> 00:29:52.452
Something else that Sara
mentioned very briefly,

00:29:52.452 --> 00:29:54.660
but I want to
stress, MIT students

00:29:54.660 --> 00:29:57.943
are actually horrible testers.

00:29:57.943 --> 00:30:02.362
I've heard this many times from
many different companies here

00:30:02.362 --> 00:30:04.330
and [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:04.330 --> 00:30:08.120
MIT students are not a
representative population

00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:09.490
of the general public.

00:30:09.490 --> 00:30:11.270
You look at systems differently.

00:30:11.270 --> 00:30:13.720
You look at screens differently.

00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:15.660
So even though most
of your testing

00:30:15.660 --> 00:30:17.581
that we're going to be
doing this semester,

00:30:17.581 --> 00:30:20.284
I imagine that a lot of testing
you're going to do on your own

00:30:20.284 --> 00:30:24.362
is going to be with other people
in your dorms, for instance,

00:30:24.362 --> 00:30:26.692
and that's fine for this class.

00:30:26.692 --> 00:30:30.980
But don't think that it's normal
to use even university students

00:30:30.980 --> 00:30:32.525
as your only test audience.

00:30:32.525 --> 00:30:36.094
That's really not representative
of the general public.

00:30:36.094 --> 00:30:39.127
MIT students in particular.

00:30:39.127 --> 00:30:40.752
PROFESSOR: MIT students
do [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:40.752 --> 00:30:42.752
PHILLIP TAN: The final
thing, as Sara mentioned,

00:30:42.752 --> 00:30:44.300
user testing in two contexts.

00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:48.496
One for overall category of
you are testing with users

00:30:48.496 --> 00:30:51.570
and then it's broken down
to more specifically, focus

00:30:51.570 --> 00:30:53.016
testing and user testing.

00:30:53.016 --> 00:30:55.908
And you may be wondering
why user testing is used

00:30:55.908 --> 00:31:00.484
and that [INAUDIBLE] two
different things, as Sara said,

00:31:00.484 --> 00:31:02.480
it's good to be more granular.

00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:06.402
What we normally refer
to as usability testing,

00:31:06.402 --> 00:31:10.803
as Sara mentioned, has
only fairly recently

00:31:10.803 --> 00:31:12.656
become the standard name for it.

00:31:12.656 --> 00:31:13.280
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:13.780
Yeah.

00:31:13.780 --> 00:31:17.567
PHILLIP TAN: Back in the '90s
and even the early 2000s,

00:31:17.567 --> 00:31:18.983
user testing and
usability testing

00:31:18.983 --> 00:31:21.415
were basically the
same thing, because we

00:31:21.415 --> 00:31:23.730
were talking about websites
and enterprise software.

00:31:23.730 --> 00:31:25.142
We were not talking about games.

00:31:25.142 --> 00:31:27.350
So the only kind of user
testing that you'd be doing,

00:31:27.350 --> 00:31:29.540
putting a piece of software
in front of someone,

00:31:29.540 --> 00:31:31.350
getting feedback, was
usability testing.

00:31:31.350 --> 00:31:34.315
That's why they had the
same name for so long.

00:31:34.315 --> 00:31:36.970
But now there's focus testing,
which is very, very applicable

00:31:36.970 --> 00:31:40.523
not just for games but also for
things like user experience.

00:31:40.523 --> 00:31:43.290
I had not heard that term
user experience [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:43.290 --> 00:31:46.744
So where it's not just can the
player figure out what to do,

00:31:46.744 --> 00:31:49.510
but the person actually
having the desired experience

00:31:49.510 --> 00:31:50.545
for playing the game.

00:31:50.545 --> 00:31:55.230
That's why now there's
multiple names for that.

00:31:55.230 --> 00:31:57.710
PROFESSOR: Thank you.

00:31:57.710 --> 00:31:59.150
Then I think I'm out of here.

00:31:59.150 --> 00:32:02.095
I'm going to sneak
off with my computer.

00:32:02.095 --> 00:32:03.220
GENEVIEVE CONLEY: Hi, guys.

00:32:03.220 --> 00:32:04.710
My name is Genevieve Conley.

00:32:04.710 --> 00:32:07.020
I'm a researcher at Riot.

00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:08.680
And some other
terms that you might

00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:11.760
have heard for that, user
experience researcher, user

00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:14.380
researcher, or the way we
were just talking about it,

00:32:14.380 --> 00:32:16.405
like user tester basically.

00:32:16.405 --> 00:32:17.580
And a little bit about me.

00:32:17.580 --> 00:32:20.210
I graduated from MIT in 2010.

00:32:20.210 --> 00:32:22.520
I got my degree in Course 9.

00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:25.810
And I actually worked
at the MIT Gambit game

00:32:25.810 --> 00:32:27.520
lab on a couple games there.

00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:30.010
So that's actually where I got
my start doing user testing,

00:32:30.010 --> 00:32:32.700
was in the summer projects
we would run play tests

00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:34.760
with local community
members, have them come in,

00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:39.010
and that's where I actually
did my first user tests.

00:32:39.010 --> 00:32:40.990
So I work at Riot Games.

00:32:40.990 --> 00:32:44.140
How many of you guys have heard
of League of Legends before?

00:32:44.140 --> 00:32:44.640
OK.

00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:47.510
How many of you actively
play League of Legends?

00:32:47.510 --> 00:32:48.050
OK, good.

00:32:48.050 --> 00:32:50.050
So I'll give a little bit
of context on the game

00:32:50.050 --> 00:32:51.090
just so I'm not losing anybody.

00:32:51.090 --> 00:32:52.290
And I'll try to
make sure I explain

00:32:52.290 --> 00:32:54.870
all of our jargon, because
sometimes when you're in a game

00:32:54.870 --> 00:32:57.745
company you just start using
the language like everybody

00:32:57.745 --> 00:32:58.620
speaks that language.

00:32:58.620 --> 00:33:01.440
But a little bit about Riot
is we make League of Legends.

00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:03.750
And our core mission
is that we aspire

00:33:03.750 --> 00:33:06.590
to be the most player-focused
game company in the world.

00:33:06.590 --> 00:33:08.290
And this is going to
be relevant to what

00:33:08.290 --> 00:33:10.331
I'm talking about today,
because you can't really

00:33:10.331 --> 00:33:13.080
be player-focused if you
don't talk to your players.

00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:15.360
So what this means at
Riot is we think about all

00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:18.370
of our decisions in terms of
how much player value it adds,

00:33:18.370 --> 00:33:21.749
or how much player pain
something negative causes.

00:33:21.749 --> 00:33:24.040
So this is like-- I don't
know if any of you familiar--

00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:25.722
we have an eSports
scene, and right now

00:33:25.722 --> 00:33:27.680
we're in the middle of
our world championships.

00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:30.500
And we created a video and
a song that would basically,

00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:33.630
we hoped to be the anthem
of the world championship.

00:33:33.630 --> 00:33:36.100
And this is something that a
couple people at the studio

00:33:36.100 --> 00:33:38.360
thought was really important, so
they just went out and made it.

00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:40.526
And the point was just to
make the players pumped up

00:33:40.526 --> 00:33:42.370
about worlds and to
give them a song that

00:33:42.370 --> 00:33:43.575
represented how they feel.

00:33:43.575 --> 00:33:45.450
And this is just a small
example of something

00:33:45.450 --> 00:33:47.286
that happens at
Riot where we really

00:33:47.286 --> 00:33:48.910
just want to do
something that we think

00:33:48.910 --> 00:33:50.380
players will think is cool.

00:33:50.380 --> 00:33:52.030
And one of the
ways if we do that

00:33:52.030 --> 00:33:53.760
is through play testing
and user testing.

00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:55.680
And I'm going to use a little
bit different terminology,

00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:58.000
so I'll make sure that I
tie it back into the way

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:00.190
that Sara's been talking
about it as we go.

00:34:00.190 --> 00:34:01.690
So a little about
League of Legends.

00:34:01.690 --> 00:34:04.290
It's generally a 5v5 game.

00:34:04.290 --> 00:34:05.670
It's a team oriented game.

00:34:05.670 --> 00:34:07.570
So you play as a
member of a team.

00:34:07.570 --> 00:34:10.190
And you usually play a specific
role or position on that team,

00:34:10.190 --> 00:34:12.139
just like basketball.

00:34:12.139 --> 00:34:15.029
And you play as one
of many champions.

00:34:15.029 --> 00:34:16.570
And it's online and
it's competitive.

00:34:16.570 --> 00:34:18.760
So like I said, we have
an eSports scene where

00:34:18.760 --> 00:34:20.060
you play against another team.

00:34:20.060 --> 00:34:23.086
And you go basically across this
map, try to take objectives,

00:34:23.086 --> 00:34:24.460
and ultimately
blow up this thing

00:34:24.460 --> 00:34:26.168
called the Nexus which
is a giant crystal

00:34:26.168 --> 00:34:29.469
on the other side of the map.

00:34:29.469 --> 00:34:31.254
And you play as a champion.

00:34:31.254 --> 00:34:33.370
And these are player
characters that each

00:34:33.370 --> 00:34:36.909
have an individual set of
skills, different play styles,

00:34:36.909 --> 00:34:39.360
and there's over 120
of them in our game.

00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:41.989
So even though each
game is session based--

00:34:41.989 --> 00:34:44.667
you don't level up your
character necessarily

00:34:44.667 --> 00:34:46.250
over the lifetime
of playing the game,

00:34:46.250 --> 00:34:49.159
each session is a new session--
there's lots of different ways

00:34:49.159 --> 00:34:51.150
to play because we have lots
of different characters, which

00:34:51.150 --> 00:34:52.358
I'll talk to in a little bit.

00:34:55.250 --> 00:34:56.750
So one of things
that I talked about

00:34:56.750 --> 00:34:59.290
is it's really hard to
be player-focused if you

00:34:59.290 --> 00:35:01.330
don't talk to your players.

00:35:01.330 --> 00:35:03.000
And one of things at
Riot is that we all

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:03.990
play League of Legends.

00:35:03.990 --> 00:35:05.700
In fact, some of
us play it a lot.

00:35:05.700 --> 00:35:07.480
Some of us play a lot at work.

00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:09.640
But just because you
play your own game

00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:12.250
doesn't mean that you
actually know what it's

00:35:12.250 --> 00:35:13.530
like for all of your players.

00:35:13.530 --> 00:35:16.140
And using MIT students
is a great example.

00:35:16.140 --> 00:35:17.970
If you guys just play
with MIT students,

00:35:17.970 --> 00:35:20.130
you might not know what
it's like for people

00:35:20.130 --> 00:35:22.380
in other countries, for example.

00:35:22.380 --> 00:35:24.130
So one of things we
try to do is make sure

00:35:24.130 --> 00:35:25.860
that we understand
our players broadly

00:35:25.860 --> 00:35:27.390
and know that we
are our players,

00:35:27.390 --> 00:35:31.510
but we are a small
sub-segment of our players.

00:35:31.510 --> 00:35:33.300
The way we use
research is it equips

00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:36.090
us to understand player beliefs,
their needs, their desires,

00:35:36.090 --> 00:35:37.590
and their relationship
with the game

00:35:37.590 --> 00:35:39.870
and with other
people in the game.

00:35:39.870 --> 00:35:43.170
And what this allows us to
do is design experiences.

00:35:43.170 --> 00:35:46.764
So there's specific
experiences, interactions

00:35:46.764 --> 00:35:47.930
that we're hoping to design.

00:35:47.930 --> 00:35:49.890
So in general when we're
creating a feature,

00:35:49.890 --> 00:35:52.550
we have a set of goals that
we're trying to achieve.

00:35:52.550 --> 00:35:55.590
And what we want to do is
we want to help designers.

00:35:55.590 --> 00:35:58.110
developers, QA,
artists, we want to help

00:35:58.110 --> 00:35:59.489
them achieve these goals.

00:35:59.489 --> 00:36:02.030
So we want to know exactly what
they're trying to do and then

00:36:02.030 --> 00:36:04.240
get them feedback on how
well those goals are being

00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:06.360
communicated to players,
how well they're actually

00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:08.110
able to interact with
those, and then what

00:36:08.110 --> 00:36:11.036
their reception is as a result.

00:36:11.036 --> 00:36:12.660
So the way I'm going
to break this down

00:36:12.660 --> 00:36:14.850
is play tests and user
labs, which is essentially

00:36:14.850 --> 00:36:16.516
the way we were talking
about it before,

00:36:16.516 --> 00:36:19.740
is play tests and user tests.

00:36:19.740 --> 00:36:23.500
So play test is the backbone
of creating your game.

00:36:23.500 --> 00:36:25.900
It's really, really
difficult to create a game

00:36:25.900 --> 00:36:27.040
without play testing it.

00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:29.540
So I'm glad that's really part
of how you guys are designing

00:36:29.540 --> 00:36:30.410
your games.

00:36:30.410 --> 00:36:32.820
And play tests basically
allow us to quickly gather

00:36:32.820 --> 00:36:35.140
information about
a game or a feature

00:36:35.140 --> 00:36:36.750
to see how it's working.

00:36:36.750 --> 00:36:39.036
And typically, this
is done with resources

00:36:39.036 --> 00:36:40.160
that are readily available.

00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:43.470
So people in your dorms, people
in your class, or at Riot,

00:36:43.470 --> 00:36:47.212
we often do it with other
Rioters, and even on the team.

00:36:47.212 --> 00:36:49.170
And some of the benefits
we can get out of this

00:36:49.170 --> 00:36:51.060
is we can identify
technical issues.

00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:53.067
Now, Sara talked
about a specific type

00:36:53.067 --> 00:36:55.150
of this, which is quality
assurance testing, which

00:36:55.150 --> 00:36:56.446
is less what I'm talking about.

00:36:56.446 --> 00:36:58.320
I'm more talking about
testing with your team

00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:00.710
to just quickly identify
technical issues that

00:37:00.710 --> 00:37:02.722
might prevent you from
playing that game.

00:37:02.722 --> 00:37:04.430
You can also look at
things like balance.

00:37:04.430 --> 00:37:06.710
So in a competitive game
like League of Legends,

00:37:06.710 --> 00:37:08.550
you play against other players.

00:37:08.550 --> 00:37:11.160
And if one type of character
is really overpowered

00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:13.950
or has a significant advantage
over another type of character,

00:37:13.950 --> 00:37:16.140
we can quickly identify
that through play testing.

00:37:16.140 --> 00:37:18.850
So for instance, our designers
have two play tests a day

00:37:18.850 --> 00:37:20.970
where they test their
in-progress champions

00:37:20.970 --> 00:37:23.150
to see if there's anything
basically game breaking

00:37:23.150 --> 00:37:25.970
like that that they can quickly
identify and iterate on.

00:37:25.970 --> 00:37:27.489
We can also look
at things for fun.

00:37:27.489 --> 00:37:29.030
I mean, this is the
most obvious one.

00:37:29.030 --> 00:37:31.196
But it's really important
when you're making a game,

00:37:31.196 --> 00:37:33.840
if the game is supposed to be
fun, that it is actually fun.

00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:36.400
And in our case, we do
want to have a fun game.

00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:39.250
So we have a whole group
of designers and developers

00:37:39.250 --> 00:37:41.300
that have a team which
is known as the play team

00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:43.190
and they make
temporary game modes.

00:37:43.190 --> 00:37:45.010
So I don't know if
anybody played recently,

00:37:45.010 --> 00:37:47.430
but we had a big in-game
event called Shurima,

00:37:47.430 --> 00:37:49.410
and we had this game
mode called Ascension.

00:37:49.410 --> 00:37:50.868
And when they were
developing that,

00:37:50.868 --> 00:37:54.070
they were often several times
a day-- many, many times a day,

00:37:54.070 --> 00:37:56.296
in some cases--
testing every iteration

00:37:56.296 --> 00:37:58.170
that they made to that
game mode to make sure

00:37:58.170 --> 00:37:59.242
that it was actually fun.

00:37:59.242 --> 00:38:00.700
And a lot of times
what you'll find

00:38:00.700 --> 00:38:03.490
is that your game isn't
necessarily fun sometimes.

00:38:03.490 --> 00:38:05.730
And that's OK, because each
time you make a change,

00:38:05.730 --> 00:38:07.410
you're getting closer
to that fun experience.

00:38:07.410 --> 00:38:09.640
One day, you'll be playing
your game and like, oh my gosh,

00:38:09.640 --> 00:38:10.570
it's actually fun now.

00:38:10.570 --> 00:38:11.153
This is great.

00:38:11.153 --> 00:38:11.800
Let's do this.

00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:14.641
So it's a really good
way to get that feedback.

00:38:14.641 --> 00:38:16.890
And another specific area
that we're looking for a lot

00:38:16.890 --> 00:38:18.305
when we play test is clarity.

00:38:18.305 --> 00:38:19.680
And clarity is a
word that we use

00:38:19.680 --> 00:38:22.500
to mean basically how
clear is the information--

00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:25.590
either the visual information
or the mechanical information--

00:38:25.590 --> 00:38:27.820
how well is that being
communicated to players?

00:38:27.820 --> 00:38:29.680
So this could be
something like with UI,

00:38:29.680 --> 00:38:31.430
if you just have a
picture and you show it

00:38:31.430 --> 00:38:34.850
to players or to your
dorm-mates, your classmates,

00:38:34.850 --> 00:38:38.040
how easily are they able to
identify what a button means?

00:38:38.040 --> 00:38:40.475
Or which things are
clickable and not clickable.

00:38:40.475 --> 00:38:42.350
Those things are all
really, really important

00:38:42.350 --> 00:38:44.150
in a game like
ours where we have

00:38:44.150 --> 00:38:46.935
five people on a team, 10
people on the map, each

00:38:46.935 --> 00:38:49.060
with their own set of
abilities and visual effects.

00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:50.810
And there could be a
lot of visual clutter

00:38:50.810 --> 00:38:53.079
if we didn't think about
this type of thing.

00:38:53.079 --> 00:38:55.620
And then the way we typically
get these, at least at Riot, is

00:38:55.620 --> 00:38:56.720
like I said, team tests.

00:38:56.720 --> 00:38:59.260
That's the example I used with
the designers and the play

00:38:59.260 --> 00:38:59.761
team.

00:38:59.761 --> 00:39:01.343
They're just playing
within their team

00:39:01.343 --> 00:39:03.680
frequently to make sure that
they can quickly and easily

00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:05.300
give each other feedback.

00:39:05.300 --> 00:39:06.960
Quality assurance
test is another type

00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:09.000
that's a very specific
implementation of this,

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:10.420
which Sara spoke to.

00:39:10.420 --> 00:39:12.456
And in house "guerrilla
tests"-- and I always

00:39:12.456 --> 00:39:14.330
have to be careful how
I say "guerrilla," not

00:39:14.330 --> 00:39:15.960
"gorilla." "Guerrilla."

00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:17.950
This is when we bring
other Rioters who

00:39:17.950 --> 00:39:20.670
aren't part of a team who
maybe haven't had exposure

00:39:20.670 --> 00:39:22.090
to that particular feature.

00:39:22.090 --> 00:39:23.790
This is particularly
useful for things

00:39:23.790 --> 00:39:27.400
like clarity or usability tests,
because we don't necessarily

00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:30.590
need to have that perception
or that sentiment that

00:39:30.590 --> 00:39:32.450
is really unique to players.

00:39:32.450 --> 00:39:34.500
What we need here
instead is just see, hey,

00:39:34.500 --> 00:39:37.637
how easily is this usable for
a reasonably tech savvy person?

00:39:37.637 --> 00:39:40.220
But even then, of course, there
are some cultural differences.

00:39:40.220 --> 00:39:41.760
There's some
hardware differences.

00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:44.510
So it's a first phase when you
do them as guerrilla testing.

00:39:44.510 --> 00:39:46.635
And you always want to make
sure that you follow up

00:39:46.635 --> 00:39:49.800
with real players
after the fact.

00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:52.280
So user labs, this is
what I really focus in.

00:39:52.280 --> 00:39:54.154
So I use a lot of
different methods at Riot,

00:39:54.154 --> 00:39:55.570
but one of the key
ways that we're

00:39:55.570 --> 00:39:58.500
able to get player feedback
is by bringing players

00:39:58.500 --> 00:40:00.577
to Riot to have
them play the game.

00:40:00.577 --> 00:40:02.160
So this is a way to
help us understand

00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:06.430
how real players will
actually approach a feature.

00:40:06.430 --> 00:40:09.650
What we get out of this is
really, really important.

00:40:09.650 --> 00:40:11.130
We get reception and interest.

00:40:11.130 --> 00:40:13.640
Like, how stoked are players
going to be about something,

00:40:13.640 --> 00:40:16.420
or what we call the
table flip reaction.

00:40:16.420 --> 00:40:18.422
Which is like, we're
working on an update

00:40:18.422 --> 00:40:19.630
to Summoner's Rift right now.

00:40:19.630 --> 00:40:20.736
And it was early on.

00:40:20.736 --> 00:40:22.360
It was really important
for us to know,

00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:23.770
were players going
to be really upset

00:40:23.770 --> 00:40:26.230
that we were changing something
that's so key to the game.

00:40:26.230 --> 00:40:27.920
So we made sure to
loop them on very early

00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:30.420
in on the process to see how
they were responding to changes

00:40:30.420 --> 00:40:31.700
we were going to make.

00:40:31.700 --> 00:40:34.220
We also look for things like
usage patterns and errors.

00:40:34.220 --> 00:40:35.595
And this is
important that we get

00:40:35.595 --> 00:40:37.740
a broad swath of
different types of players

00:40:37.740 --> 00:40:39.750
to look at this type
of thing, especially

00:40:39.750 --> 00:40:42.070
with things like we
just updated the client.

00:40:42.070 --> 00:40:44.300
Making sure that the changes
we made to the interface

00:40:44.300 --> 00:40:46.180
weren't going to
confuse players--

00:40:46.180 --> 00:40:48.810
experienced players who
were used to our old version

00:40:48.810 --> 00:40:50.280
and new players
who would be coming

00:40:50.280 --> 00:40:51.770
into our game for
the first time.

00:40:51.770 --> 00:40:54.100
We also look at
needs and desires.

00:40:54.100 --> 00:40:58.350
And this is not like Maslov's--
Maslow's hierarchy of needs.

00:40:58.350 --> 00:41:00.750
It's more like, what are
things that players really

00:41:00.750 --> 00:41:02.840
want from our game?

00:41:02.840 --> 00:41:05.870
And understanding that
can be difficult sometimes

00:41:05.870 --> 00:41:07.950
because, like I said,
we all play our game.

00:41:07.950 --> 00:41:09.700
We're very entrenched
in this experience.

00:41:09.700 --> 00:41:11.650
We have our own
experience in the game

00:41:11.650 --> 00:41:13.560
that we feel very
strongly about.

00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:15.706
But understanding that
other players might

00:41:15.706 --> 00:41:17.080
have different
needs and desires,

00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:18.663
and understanding
what proportion that

00:41:18.663 --> 00:41:20.980
represents within our
broader player base,

00:41:20.980 --> 00:41:23.430
these are really important
things to understand.

00:41:23.430 --> 00:41:25.320
How we get this is a
lot of different ways

00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:26.790
that I'm actually going
to go into in a little bit

00:41:26.790 --> 00:41:27.660
more detail.

00:41:27.660 --> 00:41:30.147
And each one has a
specific application,

00:41:30.147 --> 00:41:31.730
but there are a few
that we use pretty

00:41:31.730 --> 00:41:33.230
much in every user
lab, which I'm

00:41:33.230 --> 00:41:35.202
going to go through right now.

00:41:35.202 --> 00:41:37.160
So the first is something
we just talked about,

00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:38.455
which is just observation.

00:41:38.455 --> 00:41:41.080
And I bring this up because it's
something that anybody can do.

00:41:41.080 --> 00:41:44.000
You don't need a dedicated
researcher like myself.

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:46.210
You guys should and
will be doing this.

00:41:46.210 --> 00:41:48.200
And so in this
case, I have Chris,

00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:50.860
who is a developer at Riot,
sitting in for a player.

00:41:50.860 --> 00:41:53.550
And I have [? Jisan, ?] who
is another researcher at Riot,

00:41:53.550 --> 00:41:56.310
sitting over his shoulder
watching him play.

00:41:56.310 --> 00:41:58.570
In our case, we typically
just have one researcher

00:41:58.570 --> 00:42:00.400
in the room both
taking the notes

00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:02.140
and doing the
observation, just because

00:42:02.140 --> 00:42:03.690
of resource limitations.

00:42:03.690 --> 00:42:06.420
And because we've done this a
lot and it's our full time job.

00:42:06.420 --> 00:42:09.220
So in this case,
[? Jisan ?] is watching

00:42:09.220 --> 00:42:11.012
Chris interact with the client.

00:42:11.012 --> 00:42:13.470
And you can see in his hand,
he's actually got the script--

00:42:13.470 --> 00:42:15.670
or what we call
protocol-- in his hands

00:42:15.670 --> 00:42:18.160
so he can remember what things
he should be looking for,

00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:19.392
what things he wants to say.

00:42:19.392 --> 00:42:21.850
In this case, we don't generally
try to use it as a script.

00:42:21.850 --> 00:42:24.082
We try to use it as
a memory refresher.

00:42:24.082 --> 00:42:26.290
That way, players can feel
really comfortable with us

00:42:26.290 --> 00:42:27.873
and feel like they
have a relationship

00:42:27.873 --> 00:42:30.692
and can have a
comfortable conversation.

00:42:30.692 --> 00:42:32.650
One of the ways we achieve
this is through what

00:42:32.650 --> 00:42:34.945
we call the Think Aloud
protocol, which is what Sara

00:42:34.945 --> 00:42:36.350
was referencing,
which is basically we

00:42:36.350 --> 00:42:38.350
try to make sure that
they have this direct link

00:42:38.350 --> 00:42:39.740
from their mind to their mouth.

00:42:39.740 --> 00:42:41.530
And there's a couple
ways to achieve this

00:42:41.530 --> 00:42:43.590
that I'll speak to,
but the goal of this

00:42:43.590 --> 00:42:46.150
is we want to know exactly
what the game is communicating

00:42:46.150 --> 00:42:48.950
to players, and then how
players are processing that

00:42:48.950 --> 00:42:50.492
and creating an internal model.

00:42:50.492 --> 00:42:51.950
And the best way
to do that is just

00:42:51.950 --> 00:42:53.610
to step back and
let them tell you

00:42:53.610 --> 00:42:55.210
exactly what they're seeing.

00:42:55.210 --> 00:42:57.270
And if you aren't quite
sure what they're seeing,

00:42:57.270 --> 00:42:59.542
then you can follow up, which
I'll get to in a second.

00:42:59.542 --> 00:43:02.000
So here's an example of a player
who's seeing our character

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:04.210
Lucian, who is a
champion who was released

00:43:04.210 --> 00:43:05.810
fairly recently in the game.

00:43:05.810 --> 00:43:08.190
She's seeing him before
he had been released

00:43:08.190 --> 00:43:09.940
in a work in progress
state and giving us

00:43:09.940 --> 00:43:12.374
feedback on what she sees.

00:43:12.374 --> 00:43:13.040
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:43:13.040 --> 00:43:17.140
-I can see that he walks
faster than the normal--

00:43:17.140 --> 00:43:18.012
[END PLAYBACK]

00:43:18.012 --> 00:43:21.002
GENEVIEVE CONLEY: Sorry, we
forgot to plug in the audio.

00:43:21.002 --> 00:43:22.710
I think you guys could
hear it all right.

00:43:26.066 --> 00:43:26.566
All right.

00:43:26.566 --> 00:43:27.048
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:43:27.048 --> 00:43:27.530
-[INAUDIBLE].

00:43:27.530 --> 00:43:28.488
GENEVIEVE CONLEY: Oops.

00:43:31.386 --> 00:43:36.832
-I can see that he walks faster
than the normal character

00:43:36.832 --> 00:43:41.188
would, but his animation
doesn't make it seem so.

00:43:41.188 --> 00:43:44.576
It seems like he takes
a really big stride,

00:43:44.576 --> 00:43:49.076
but I was imagining him
to walk really fast.

00:43:49.076 --> 00:43:51.556
But it seems like it
looks like that way.

00:43:51.556 --> 00:43:52.140
[END PLAYBACK]

00:43:52.140 --> 00:43:53.764
GENEVIEVE CONLEY: So
this is an example

00:43:53.764 --> 00:43:56.210
where the player has just
brought this up to us that she

00:43:56.210 --> 00:43:58.650
expected him to move one
way, and he's actually

00:43:58.650 --> 00:44:00.349
operating in a different way.

00:44:00.349 --> 00:44:02.140
You can think of this
is as like, basically

00:44:02.140 --> 00:44:03.750
a violation of
expectations, which

00:44:03.750 --> 00:44:07.010
is often what we're looking for
especially with our characters.

00:44:07.010 --> 00:44:09.580
Does what you see and what you
hear about a champion match

00:44:09.580 --> 00:44:11.340
with how they actually play?

00:44:11.340 --> 00:44:13.540
So one way you can do this
is to just let them talk.

00:44:13.540 --> 00:44:17.090
And it is really important
not to be giving feedback on

00:44:17.090 --> 00:44:19.150
whether or not you
think they're correct,

00:44:19.150 --> 00:44:20.840
especially if they
do have a question.

00:44:20.840 --> 00:44:23.300
It's also really important
not to be judgmental, right?

00:44:23.300 --> 00:44:24.895
So the way you phrase
your questions,

00:44:24.895 --> 00:44:26.770
even if you aren't
actually being judgmental,

00:44:26.770 --> 00:44:29.620
sometimes players might think
that you're judging them.

00:44:29.620 --> 00:44:32.120
So one of the contexts
we give players upfront

00:44:32.120 --> 00:44:33.942
is always for us,
since we actually

00:44:33.942 --> 00:44:36.400
didn't work on the game or the
feature that they're seeing,

00:44:36.400 --> 00:44:38.540
we can say, we
didn't work on this.

00:44:38.540 --> 00:44:40.920
It's really important that
you give us honest feedback.

00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:42.669
I'm not going to go
home and cry at night,

00:44:42.669 --> 00:44:44.894
so I want you to give me
totally honest feedback.

00:44:44.894 --> 00:44:46.810
And we also let them
know that sometimes we're

00:44:46.810 --> 00:44:49.060
going to ask them questions,
and we're asking it

00:44:49.060 --> 00:44:50.670
so that we can
understand what they're

00:44:50.670 --> 00:44:51.920
thinking because
that's what we're

00:44:51.920 --> 00:44:53.086
interested in understanding.

00:44:53.086 --> 00:44:54.480
We're not asking
it because there

00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:56.966
is a right or wrong answer.

00:44:56.966 --> 00:44:58.590
So one of the ways
that makes it easier

00:44:58.590 --> 00:45:00.910
to make sure that
we understand what

00:45:00.910 --> 00:45:02.455
their mental model
of the game is

00:45:02.455 --> 00:45:04.600
is a follow-up with
some probing questions.

00:45:04.600 --> 00:45:06.330
So the player in
the previous example

00:45:06.330 --> 00:45:08.220
was pretty clear about
what she was seeing

00:45:08.220 --> 00:45:10.066
and why it violated
her expectations,

00:45:10.066 --> 00:45:11.690
but sometimes players
don't necessarily

00:45:11.690 --> 00:45:14.110
know why it doesn't actually
fit what they expected.

00:45:14.110 --> 00:45:16.110
Or they might know that
something's frustrating,

00:45:16.110 --> 00:45:18.340
but they're not necessarily
giving you the answer why.

00:45:18.340 --> 00:45:19.560
So one of the ways
you can follow it up

00:45:19.560 --> 00:45:21.170
is either with probing
questions, which

00:45:21.170 --> 00:45:23.640
you ask in the moment, or you
can follow up with interviews

00:45:23.640 --> 00:45:24.500
after the fact.

00:45:24.500 --> 00:45:26.499
So here's an example of
[? Jisan ?] following up

00:45:26.499 --> 00:45:29.214
with a player who just saw
Lucian for the first time.

00:45:29.214 --> 00:45:29.880
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:45:29.880 --> 00:45:32.130
-How was that play [INAUDIBLE]?

00:45:32.130 --> 00:45:33.250
-I thought it was fun.

00:45:33.250 --> 00:45:35.896
I thought it was
[? different. ?]

00:45:35.896 --> 00:45:38.782
-What makes it fun and
something different about it?

00:45:42.680 --> 00:45:47.914
-So he, I guess, normal
[INAUDIBLE] skills,

00:45:47.914 --> 00:45:49.122
just increased the intensity.

00:45:51.800 --> 00:45:55.290
A lot of his skills based off
of move speed and [INAUDIBLE]

00:45:55.290 --> 00:45:58.720
speed, and I guess he
feels [? confident. ?]

00:45:58.720 --> 00:45:59.454
[END PLAYBACK]

00:45:59.454 --> 00:46:01.120
GENEVIEVE CONLEY: So
this is an example.

00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:02.578
A lot of times
you'll find this, is

00:46:02.578 --> 00:46:04.530
that when you ask
that initial question,

00:46:04.530 --> 00:46:06.260
you get a short response.

00:46:06.260 --> 00:46:09.010
And what we're always trying
to do as researchers is invite

00:46:09.010 --> 00:46:12.260
a conversation where they're
just really comfortable telling

00:46:12.260 --> 00:46:14.855
us exactly what they feel and
giving us a lot of detail.

00:46:14.855 --> 00:46:17.230
So in the first question, he
asked a really broad opening

00:46:17.230 --> 00:46:19.200
question, which
was "how was that?"

00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:20.992
He didn't even ask,
"how did that feel,"

00:46:20.992 --> 00:46:22.700
which might lead in
a certain direction--

00:46:22.700 --> 00:46:24.930
although that would be an
appropriate question as well.

00:46:24.930 --> 00:46:26.400
He left it wide
open for the player

00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:28.502
to take us where they
wanted to talk about it.

00:46:28.502 --> 00:46:29.960
So the player
mentioned that it was

00:46:29.960 --> 00:46:31.500
fun and something different.

00:46:31.500 --> 00:46:33.430
So [? Jisan ?] wanted
to get more depth

00:46:33.430 --> 00:46:35.940
into what does that actually
mean, because that alone

00:46:35.940 --> 00:46:37.560
doesn't give us
enough direction to be

00:46:37.560 --> 00:46:40.020
able to provide to our
designers to say what was good,

00:46:40.020 --> 00:46:41.130
what was working.

00:46:41.130 --> 00:46:44.300
So he mirrored exactly what
the player said back at him.

00:46:44.300 --> 00:46:46.600
He said, oh, what
was fun and what

00:46:46.600 --> 00:46:48.540
was the thing that
made it feel different?

00:46:48.540 --> 00:46:50.540
And then the player, that
way we're not actually

00:46:50.540 --> 00:46:52.130
putting our own
spin on interpreting

00:46:52.130 --> 00:46:54.746
what we think they're saying is
fun or maybe what's different.

00:46:54.746 --> 00:46:56.120
We're just mirroring
exactly back

00:46:56.120 --> 00:46:59.075
what they said so that they
can give us more detail.

00:46:59.075 --> 00:47:00.450
You have to be
careful with that,

00:47:00.450 --> 00:47:02.320
because you also don't want
to sound cold and clinical

00:47:02.320 --> 00:47:04.770
like you're sitting in an
office somewhere writing down

00:47:04.770 --> 00:47:06.495
everything they say,
which you will be.

00:47:06.495 --> 00:47:09.371
You want to make it feel like
it's a natural conversation.

00:47:09.371 --> 00:47:10.870
So we're really
lucky because we get

00:47:10.870 --> 00:47:12.440
to work with League
of Legends players

00:47:12.440 --> 00:47:14.390
so we already have a
connection built up with them

00:47:14.390 --> 00:47:16.973
where we can talk about it, but
it's really important that you

00:47:16.973 --> 00:47:19.290
make that as hey, I want
to know what you think.

00:47:19.290 --> 00:47:20.374
You're really valuable.

00:47:20.374 --> 00:47:22.040
Let's just have a
conversation about it.

00:47:22.040 --> 00:47:25.750
And it can be really
challenging sometimes.

00:47:25.750 --> 00:47:27.530
So this is one that
you guys are already

00:47:27.530 --> 00:47:30.120
pretty familiar with,
too, is part of interviews

00:47:30.120 --> 00:47:33.259
that I've clumped in here is
basically the questionnaire.

00:47:33.259 --> 00:47:34.800
Sara gave you guys
some great context

00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:36.242
about when this might be useful.

00:47:36.242 --> 00:47:37.700
Here's an example
of when we use it

00:47:37.700 --> 00:47:39.690
in League of Legends research.

00:47:39.690 --> 00:47:41.830
So this is an example
with Azir, who

00:47:41.830 --> 00:47:44.536
is a character who just came
out in League of Legends.

00:47:44.536 --> 00:47:46.160
This is actually from
quite a long time

00:47:46.160 --> 00:47:47.991
ago when he was in
the concept phase.

00:47:47.991 --> 00:47:49.490
And this is something
we do actually

00:47:49.490 --> 00:47:52.031
with most of our concepts, is
we put them in front of players

00:47:52.031 --> 00:47:54.140
before they go into
development to see, hey,

00:47:54.140 --> 00:47:55.170
is this something
that feels like it

00:47:55.170 --> 00:47:56.794
fits in the world of
League of Legends?

00:47:56.794 --> 00:47:58.940
Is it clear where maybe
the source of power is?

00:47:58.940 --> 00:48:01.148
And does this look like a
champion you would actually

00:48:01.148 --> 00:48:01.760
want to play?

00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:04.446
Now, we don't use data to
drive decisions at Riot.

00:48:04.446 --> 00:48:05.820
I want to make
that really clear.

00:48:05.820 --> 00:48:06.810
We use it to inform.

00:48:06.810 --> 00:48:08.440
So just because something
wasn't resonating

00:48:08.440 --> 00:48:09.815
with players in
our labs wouldn't

00:48:09.815 --> 00:48:11.610
mean that we would
cancel a character.

00:48:11.610 --> 00:48:13.220
It's just a way for
us to get feedback

00:48:13.220 --> 00:48:15.480
for our designers who
already have their experience

00:48:15.480 --> 00:48:18.320
and the experience
testing with other Rioters

00:48:18.320 --> 00:48:20.815
to help them make
informed decisions.

00:48:20.815 --> 00:48:22.940
So what's useful about a
questionnaire in this case

00:48:22.940 --> 00:48:26.200
is that we can compare
across champions over time

00:48:26.200 --> 00:48:28.270
and across different
roles or positions

00:48:28.270 --> 00:48:32.334
and see what is resonating
and what does good look like.

00:48:32.334 --> 00:48:34.000
We also use this as
a jumping off point.

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:35.260
So we start with
a questionnaire,

00:48:35.260 --> 00:48:37.545
and then we go into a more
detailed interview about it

00:48:37.545 --> 00:48:39.670
to make sure that we're
getting enough detail to be

00:48:39.670 --> 00:48:41.836
able to provide useful
information to the designers.

00:48:44.140 --> 00:48:46.090
So you guys are also
probably pretty familiar

00:48:46.090 --> 00:48:48.290
with the idea of
experiments in general.

00:48:48.290 --> 00:48:51.550
But part of research testing
can be devising experiments.

00:48:51.550 --> 00:48:54.420
So we often hire people
from psychology backgrounds

00:48:54.420 --> 00:48:56.010
or research
backgrounds in academia

00:48:56.010 --> 00:48:58.580
because they have experience
setting up experiments.

00:48:58.580 --> 00:49:00.100
So this is like the classic one.

00:49:00.100 --> 00:49:01.390
I don't know if you guys
have already covered

00:49:01.390 --> 00:49:02.780
this, the Engelbart experiment.

00:49:02.780 --> 00:49:03.450
OK.

00:49:03.450 --> 00:49:06.020
So this is foundational
human computer interaction.

00:49:06.020 --> 00:49:08.430
It's one of the
most cited studies.

00:49:08.430 --> 00:49:11.290
And it's English, Engerlbart,
and Berman basically

00:49:11.290 --> 00:49:14.450
were looking for a
way to improve a way

00:49:14.450 --> 00:49:17.310
to interact with a screen
or text manipulation.

00:49:17.310 --> 00:49:18.997
And what they
proposed was something

00:49:18.997 --> 00:49:20.830
that was radical and
was called the "mouse."

00:49:20.830 --> 00:49:22.714
Maybe you've heard of it.

00:49:22.714 --> 00:49:24.130
So that thing in
the right, I know

00:49:24.130 --> 00:49:25.960
it's not a really
clear photo, but that

00:49:25.960 --> 00:49:28.842
is one of the first early
prototypes of a mouse.

00:49:28.842 --> 00:49:30.800
And what they wanted to
do is they want to see,

00:49:30.800 --> 00:49:33.160
is this better than some
of these other interactions

00:49:33.160 --> 00:49:35.380
out there.

00:49:35.380 --> 00:49:38.380
Qualitative experience alone
might not be a very strong way

00:49:38.380 --> 00:49:40.330
to prove it in this
case, especially when you

00:49:40.330 --> 00:49:43.160
can collect quantitative
data to back it up.

00:49:43.160 --> 00:49:46.400
So what they did is
they used the time

00:49:46.400 --> 00:49:48.860
that it took to complete a
task, a very specific task that

00:49:48.860 --> 00:49:51.235
was given across all these
different ways of manipulating

00:49:51.235 --> 00:49:52.040
text.

00:49:52.040 --> 00:49:55.305
And they saw how many errors
the user made in this case.

00:49:55.305 --> 00:49:57.180
So you can see that the
mouse did pretty well

00:49:57.180 --> 00:49:58.221
in terms of time overall.

00:49:58.221 --> 00:50:00.430
It didn't take the
participants very long

00:50:00.430 --> 00:50:02.180
to be able to complete the task.

00:50:02.180 --> 00:50:03.760
But it had very
few errors, which

00:50:03.760 --> 00:50:06.940
made it overall the best
out of these different ways

00:50:06.940 --> 00:50:07.740
to select text.

00:50:07.740 --> 00:50:09.656
And you can see some of
the other ones on here

00:50:09.656 --> 00:50:13.080
were things like knee control,
joystick, a graphicon, which

00:50:13.080 --> 00:50:17.170
is like an arc drawer, a
light pen, and a joystick.

00:50:17.170 --> 00:50:19.020
And all of these were
ways that we could

00:50:19.020 --> 00:50:21.050
have gone instead of the mouse.

00:50:21.050 --> 00:50:22.540
But based on some
of this research,

00:50:22.540 --> 00:50:24.147
they were able to
improve their design

00:50:24.147 --> 00:50:25.980
and now you can see I'm
using one right now.

00:50:29.630 --> 00:50:32.124
And as part of the experimental
approach, I broke it out,

00:50:32.124 --> 00:50:33.540
but there's a
specific way you can

00:50:33.540 --> 00:50:36.020
look at it, which is using
physiological techniques.

00:50:36.020 --> 00:50:38.720
And there are many, and I'm
just going to cover two.

00:50:38.720 --> 00:50:41.270
And typically, these are
used for very specific types

00:50:41.270 --> 00:50:42.020
of research.

00:50:42.020 --> 00:50:43.000
They're very exciting.

00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:45.666
So oftentimes, you'll see people
want to use them on everything.

00:50:45.666 --> 00:50:49.020
But they're very particularly
useful for certain cases.

00:50:49.020 --> 00:50:52.240
So this is an example of eye
tracking, which is basically

00:50:52.240 --> 00:50:54.140
fundamentally, we
put a camera up

00:50:54.140 --> 00:50:56.432
that's able to specially
track where eye movements are.

00:50:56.432 --> 00:50:58.931
And there are more sophisticated
ways you can look at this--

00:50:58.931 --> 00:51:00.692
and I'm sure a bunch
of researchers at MIT

00:51:00.692 --> 00:51:02.150
could tell you a
lot more about it.

00:51:02.150 --> 00:51:03.510
But in this case, it
was pretty simple.

00:51:03.510 --> 00:51:05.551
We were just looking at
where people were looking

00:51:05.551 --> 00:51:08.330
on the screen and how
often and how long

00:51:08.330 --> 00:51:09.430
they were looking there.

00:51:09.430 --> 00:51:11.120
So you can see the
red parts of the map

00:51:11.120 --> 00:51:14.870
here are the parts where there
are more intense gazes or more

00:51:14.870 --> 00:51:16.520
gazes overall.

00:51:16.520 --> 00:51:18.112
So unsurprisingly
to probably most

00:51:18.112 --> 00:51:19.820
of the League of
Legends players in here,

00:51:19.820 --> 00:51:21.840
or you guys as
gamers in general,

00:51:21.840 --> 00:51:24.250
the mini map has a lot of gaze.

00:51:24.250 --> 00:51:27.250
The bottom part, which is where
the abilities are displayed,

00:51:27.250 --> 00:51:28.510
also has a lot of gaze.

00:51:28.510 --> 00:51:30.010
That has a lot of
information that's

00:51:30.010 --> 00:51:32.601
really relevant to players
like the cool down timer,

00:51:32.601 --> 00:51:34.850
basically when the ability
is going to be ready again.

00:51:34.850 --> 00:51:37.183
And the center of the screen
is where most of the action

00:51:37.183 --> 00:51:37.890
happens.

00:51:37.890 --> 00:51:40.251
So this type of information
is helpful for us.

00:51:40.251 --> 00:51:42.500
If we want to, for instance,
introduce new information

00:51:42.500 --> 00:51:43.970
on the screen,
we'd want to know,

00:51:43.970 --> 00:51:45.230
hey, are we going
to introduce this

00:51:45.230 --> 00:51:47.700
in a place that's going to get
a lot of traffic naturally.

00:51:47.700 --> 00:51:49.400
But also is it going
to interrupt things

00:51:49.400 --> 00:51:52.667
that that gaze is there for
a very important reason,

00:51:52.667 --> 00:51:54.250
and maybe we shouldn't
interrupt that.

00:51:54.250 --> 00:51:58.162
So we can help us to inform
those types of decisions.

00:51:58.162 --> 00:52:00.120
There's also many other
types of physiological,

00:52:00.120 --> 00:52:02.350
and I'll just hint at
one right now which

00:52:02.350 --> 00:52:05.760
is things like galvanic
skin response, anything that

00:52:05.760 --> 00:52:08.600
has to do with
physiological arousal,

00:52:08.600 --> 00:52:10.790
either for stress or excitement.

00:52:10.790 --> 00:52:13.250
These can help with situations
where maybe players wouldn't

00:52:13.250 --> 00:52:15.380
be able to vocalize
why something

00:52:15.380 --> 00:52:17.710
was frustrating or exciting.

00:52:17.710 --> 00:52:19.840
Or it can also help
combat some biases

00:52:19.840 --> 00:52:21.980
like recency
effect, where if you

00:52:21.980 --> 00:52:23.790
ask a player at
the end of the lab

00:52:23.790 --> 00:52:26.014
or at the end of a play
test what was interesting

00:52:26.014 --> 00:52:27.930
or what was frustrating,
they might preference

00:52:27.930 --> 00:52:29.440
things that were at the end.

00:52:29.440 --> 00:52:32.540
Or they might preference things
that were really emotionally

00:52:32.540 --> 00:52:35.400
significant for them, but might
forget smaller things that

00:52:35.400 --> 00:52:38.580
are still maybe small
frustrating things that

00:52:38.580 --> 00:52:41.431
build up over time.

00:52:41.431 --> 00:52:43.180
So none of this is
really that interesting

00:52:43.180 --> 00:52:45.820
if I don't give you an example
of how we actually do at Riot.

00:52:45.820 --> 00:52:47.000
So here's a case study.

00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:50.859
And I actually presented this
last year as part of a talk

00:52:50.859 --> 00:52:51.650
that we did at MIT.

00:52:51.650 --> 00:52:54.760
So I apologize if a little
bit is re-run for you guys.

00:52:54.760 --> 00:52:57.531
I'll try to spice it up
a little bit as I go.

00:52:57.531 --> 00:52:59.905
So I'm going to be talking
about Lucian, who I introduced

00:52:59.905 --> 00:53:00.920
to you guys earlier.

00:53:00.920 --> 00:53:03.250
He is one of the player
characters or champions

00:53:03.250 --> 00:53:06.760
in League of Legends.

00:53:06.760 --> 00:53:08.594
So where we always
start as researchers,

00:53:08.594 --> 00:53:10.760
and part of the job that I
haven't really alluded to

00:53:10.760 --> 00:53:14.070
yet is we spend a lot of time
talking to our designers,

00:53:14.070 --> 00:53:16.480
to our developers, to our
artists, to our producers,

00:53:16.480 --> 00:53:18.027
to make sure we
understand the goals

00:53:18.027 --> 00:53:19.110
they're trying to achieve.

00:53:19.110 --> 00:53:20.110
And I don't know
how many of you guys

00:53:20.110 --> 00:53:22.460
got to catch August
Browning's talk last night,

00:53:22.460 --> 00:53:24.030
but for the champion
designers, they

00:53:24.030 --> 00:53:26.867
start with a very specific
idea of what goals

00:53:26.867 --> 00:53:27.950
they're trying to achieve.

00:53:27.950 --> 00:53:29.980
What is this player
character going to feel like?

00:53:29.980 --> 00:53:32.021
What are you going to feel
like when you play it?

00:53:32.021 --> 00:53:34.130
What is the mechanics
supposed to feel like?

00:53:34.130 --> 00:53:35.870
What is the theme
supposed to feel like?

00:53:35.870 --> 00:53:37.150
How does this
resonate with players?

00:53:37.150 --> 00:53:38.350
How does it fit in
League of Legends?

00:53:38.350 --> 00:53:40.391
These are all really
important questions for them

00:53:40.391 --> 00:53:43.081
that they're constantly
asking themselves.

00:53:43.081 --> 00:53:44.830
And in the case of
Lucian, he was supposed

00:53:44.830 --> 00:53:47.250
to feel fast, sleek, speedy.

00:53:47.250 --> 00:53:48.440
He was like a gun ninja.

00:53:48.440 --> 00:53:49.841
Like pew, pew.

00:53:49.841 --> 00:53:50.340
No?

00:53:50.340 --> 00:53:51.900
All right.

00:53:51.900 --> 00:53:53.950
Trying to see if you
guys were awake there.

00:53:53.950 --> 00:53:56.080
And he's a range
damage character

00:53:56.080 --> 00:53:57.480
with finesse game play.

00:53:57.480 --> 00:54:02.280
And he basically has
the high skill ceiling.

00:54:02.280 --> 00:54:05.220
And what that means is basically
he's harder to pick up,

00:54:05.220 --> 00:54:08.370
but when you master him it's
a really rewarding feeling.

00:54:08.370 --> 00:54:11.250
So that's a trade off
between accessibility, maybe

00:54:11.250 --> 00:54:12.860
how quickly a player
can pick him up,

00:54:12.860 --> 00:54:14.810
or what level a player
can pick him up,

00:54:14.810 --> 00:54:17.050
for a reward of how
rewarding that feels when

00:54:17.050 --> 00:54:19.180
you do master that champion.

00:54:19.180 --> 00:54:22.407
And some of the challenges in
this were, this guy, his theme

00:54:22.407 --> 00:54:23.240
is pretty different.

00:54:23.240 --> 00:54:26.480
His equilibrium style, if
you've ever seen that movie.

00:54:26.480 --> 00:54:28.480
And that's not something
we had necessarily

00:54:28.480 --> 00:54:30.271
done that much in League
of Legends before,

00:54:30.271 --> 00:54:32.510
so we wanted to make
sure, does he even fit.

00:54:32.510 --> 00:54:34.135
And we also wanted
to know how do

00:54:34.135 --> 00:54:37.210
you let a player feel super
fast and speedy in what

00:54:37.210 --> 00:54:39.230
is essentially an
RTS style game.

00:54:39.230 --> 00:54:42.580
It's a challenge.

00:54:42.580 --> 00:54:45.680
So this is what the test
plan eventually looked like.

00:54:45.680 --> 00:54:47.990
It's not necessarily
where we started from.

00:54:47.990 --> 00:54:49.685
But we started with
concept testing,

00:54:49.685 --> 00:54:51.810
and then we went through
actually three lab studies

00:54:51.810 --> 00:54:53.780
with iteration in between
based on the feedback

00:54:53.780 --> 00:54:55.110
we got from players.

00:54:55.110 --> 00:54:59.990
And after he launched, we did
some post-launch evaluation.

00:54:59.990 --> 00:55:01.880
So step one, just like
I showed you earlier,

00:55:01.880 --> 00:55:03.210
was to do this concept testing.

00:55:03.210 --> 00:55:07.850
And we got some pretty good
feedback based on that.

00:55:07.850 --> 00:55:09.620
His fantasy was
good with players.

00:55:09.620 --> 00:55:10.520
They liked the mood.

00:55:10.520 --> 00:55:10.850
[THUD]

00:55:10.850 --> 00:55:11.770
They felt like he fit.

00:55:11.770 --> 00:55:12.793
Are you all right?

00:55:12.793 --> 00:55:14.482
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:55:14.482 --> 00:55:15.940
GENEVIEVE CONLEY:
And he made sense

00:55:15.940 --> 00:55:18.340
for the role of an AD carry,
which again is like a range

00:55:18.340 --> 00:55:20.180
damage dealer in this case.

00:55:20.180 --> 00:55:23.120
So he had high appeal scores and
the theme felt really strong,

00:55:23.120 --> 00:55:25.250
but one thing we very
quickly identified--

00:55:25.250 --> 00:55:26.874
it's a little hard
to see on this one--

00:55:26.874 --> 00:55:28.660
but his guns were
different colors.

00:55:28.660 --> 00:55:31.060
So players expected the
guns to do different things

00:55:31.060 --> 00:55:33.670
based on their colors, which
was not what we were planning.

00:55:33.670 --> 00:55:35.170
So this was very
good early feedback

00:55:35.170 --> 00:55:37.045
before we got very far
into development where

00:55:37.045 --> 00:55:39.290
we could pivot and make sure
that the idea of the two

00:55:39.290 --> 00:55:42.330
guns doing the same
thing was conveyed.

00:55:42.330 --> 00:55:44.016
So based on the
feedback we got, we

00:55:44.016 --> 00:55:45.640
were able to give
that to the designers

00:55:45.640 --> 00:55:47.800
and they continued
their development.

00:55:47.800 --> 00:55:49.550
And then after a
little bit of time,

00:55:49.550 --> 00:55:51.250
we were able to take
it into the lab.

00:55:51.250 --> 00:55:53.190
So we started with a
Lucian that was designed

00:55:53.190 --> 00:55:54.980
to be a speedy range assassin.

00:55:54.980 --> 00:55:58.130
He had a double shot
and a utility kit.

00:55:58.130 --> 00:55:59.880
And when I refer to
kit, just to be clear,

00:55:59.880 --> 00:56:01.640
that means his set of abilities.

00:56:01.640 --> 00:56:03.140
And characters in
League of Legends

00:56:03.140 --> 00:56:05.830
generally have three abilities
and then an ultimate ability,

00:56:05.830 --> 00:56:08.280
where the ultimate is like
the super big bad power

00:56:08.280 --> 00:56:11.530
that you get after some
leveling of the character.

00:56:11.530 --> 00:56:14.870
So I blew the reveal
here, but in the first lab

00:56:14.870 --> 00:56:18.140
we found out that he didn't
really feel that sleek

00:56:18.140 --> 00:56:18.810
and fast.

00:56:18.810 --> 00:56:19.840
He felt stiff.

00:56:19.840 --> 00:56:22.940
He planted and then fired
his double shot, which

00:56:22.940 --> 00:56:25.220
made him feel like a turret.

00:56:25.220 --> 00:56:26.990
And people did like
his visual theme.

00:56:26.990 --> 00:56:28.781
They thought it was
compelling, but it just

00:56:28.781 --> 00:56:30.790
didn't match his play style.

00:56:30.790 --> 00:56:33.500
So we took this back to the
designers we said, hey guys.

00:56:33.500 --> 00:56:34.550
Here's the videos.

00:56:34.550 --> 00:56:35.587
Here's the notes.

00:56:35.587 --> 00:56:37.170
We usually make a
highlight reel based

00:56:37.170 --> 00:56:39.052
on what we see to
support our evidence so

00:56:39.052 --> 00:56:41.260
that the designers can get
enough feedback from that,

00:56:41.260 --> 00:56:43.060
as they are our
subject matter experts

00:56:43.060 --> 00:56:45.924
and really know how to
interpret what they see.

00:56:45.924 --> 00:56:46.590
And we said, OK.

00:56:46.590 --> 00:56:47.450
Let's go back.

00:56:47.450 --> 00:56:49.300
You guys take some
time, do some changes.

00:56:49.300 --> 00:56:51.250
We'll take it in the lab again.

00:56:51.250 --> 00:56:52.290
So we did lab study two.

00:56:52.290 --> 00:56:54.780
And this time, we had a
different Lucian to bring in.

00:56:54.780 --> 00:56:56.100
This time, he was more mobile.

00:56:56.100 --> 00:56:58.060
He was basically a
range [INAUDIBLE],

00:56:58.060 --> 00:57:01.740
running gun, double shot guy.

00:57:01.740 --> 00:57:04.760
Well, we had a little bit of
a mixed bag of results here.

00:57:04.760 --> 00:57:07.820
He did feel a little bit faster.

00:57:07.820 --> 00:57:11.430
But some poses and
animations felt awkward.

00:57:11.430 --> 00:57:14.611
And he was high speed
in the numbers-- which

00:57:14.611 --> 00:57:16.360
I'll talk about in a
second-- but he still

00:57:16.360 --> 00:57:18.580
felt slow for some reason.

00:57:18.580 --> 00:57:21.550
But worst of all, we
got quotes like this one

00:57:21.550 --> 00:57:23.120
about the ultimate,
which was "It

00:57:23.120 --> 00:57:25.720
worked in the way I did
not want it to work,"

00:57:25.720 --> 00:57:29.607
which is a pretty good sign
that something's wrong.

00:57:29.607 --> 00:57:31.440
So we took all this
back to designers again.

00:57:31.440 --> 00:57:33.100
We said, hey guys--
and the animators

00:57:33.100 --> 00:57:35.349
and the artists in this case,
of course-- and we said,

00:57:35.349 --> 00:57:36.040
he feels slow.

00:57:36.040 --> 00:57:37.440
His ultimate doesn't
really have the usability

00:57:37.440 --> 00:57:39.930
that people expect, but the
double shot theme is working,

00:57:39.930 --> 00:57:41.513
so we're definitely
on the right track

00:57:41.513 --> 00:57:44.440
and players are still very
excited about this champion.

00:57:44.440 --> 00:57:46.760
So now we're in a
bind, and this is often

00:57:46.760 --> 00:57:50.220
the case when you're working
with research from players

00:57:50.220 --> 00:57:52.185
because they're not
always able to articulate

00:57:52.185 --> 00:57:53.810
exactly what's wrong
because they don't

00:57:53.810 --> 00:57:55.526
have the context that you do.

00:57:55.526 --> 00:57:57.150
So this is why it's
so important for us

00:57:57.150 --> 00:57:59.740
as researchers to pair with
our designers, our artists,

00:57:59.740 --> 00:58:02.130
our producers, and
our players to be

00:58:02.130 --> 00:58:03.840
able to get the
right kind of data

00:58:03.840 --> 00:58:05.800
to make informed decisions.

00:58:05.800 --> 00:58:07.870
So here was our problem.

00:58:07.870 --> 00:58:10.240
The frame delay between
his basic attacks--

00:58:10.240 --> 00:58:13.330
which is actually very,
very low in this last lab.

00:58:13.330 --> 00:58:15.620
Usually that means
things feel fast.

00:58:15.620 --> 00:58:18.920
It's a pretty standard way when
we're developing characters

00:58:18.920 --> 00:58:21.280
to be like, OK, this
will feel faster.

00:58:21.280 --> 00:58:24.520
He also had a very high
base movement speed,

00:58:24.520 --> 00:58:27.650
which means that the time it
took him to run from point A

00:58:27.650 --> 00:58:29.900
to point B was
pretty high relative

00:58:29.900 --> 00:58:31.286
to the rest of our champions.

00:58:31.286 --> 00:58:32.910
And if that weren't
enough, he actually

00:58:32.910 --> 00:58:35.090
had a dash ability which
means that he could just

00:58:35.090 --> 00:58:37.120
jump basically from
one point to another.

00:58:37.120 --> 00:58:40.540
All of these things should
have made him feel fast.

00:58:40.540 --> 00:58:42.660
But players were saying
he didn't feel fast,

00:58:42.660 --> 00:58:45.840
so there was something wrong.

00:58:45.840 --> 00:58:49.590
So our designers and our
artists and our producers

00:58:49.590 --> 00:58:52.660
took all of this information
back, looked at the videos,

00:58:52.660 --> 00:58:56.760
play tested the heck out of it,
and came to this conclusion.

00:58:56.760 --> 00:58:59.410
They increased the
ability responsiveness

00:58:59.410 --> 00:59:03.050
and they changed how animation
flowed from one state

00:59:03.050 --> 00:59:04.030
to another.

00:59:04.030 --> 00:59:05.727
So I'm not an
artist, but what this

00:59:05.727 --> 00:59:07.310
means to me is that
they are basically

00:59:07.310 --> 00:59:10.860
able to make the transitions
from animation a, animation

00:59:10.860 --> 00:59:13.490
b, or ability a to
ability b, and make

00:59:13.490 --> 00:59:15.450
those feel more natural.

00:59:15.450 --> 00:59:17.020
Not like me.

00:59:17.020 --> 00:59:22.510
And they also gave more
feedback to the double shot.

00:59:22.510 --> 00:59:24.690
And again, this is where
subject matter expertise is

00:59:24.690 --> 00:59:27.790
so important because our
animators, our visual artists,

00:59:27.790 --> 00:59:30.300
our designers knew
this bag of tricks

00:59:30.300 --> 00:59:32.780
to be able to apply to it.

00:59:32.780 --> 00:59:34.640
And finally, they
were able to make

00:59:34.640 --> 00:59:36.370
the ultimate ability clearer.

00:59:36.370 --> 00:59:37.860
So they were able
to the telegraph

00:59:37.860 --> 00:59:39.760
better what it was
actually supposed

00:59:39.760 --> 00:59:44.120
to do so that players would
have more accurate expectations.

00:59:44.120 --> 00:59:46.330
So we took it to lab
study number three.

00:59:46.330 --> 00:59:48.815
We put it in and
finally, the game

00:59:48.815 --> 00:59:50.910
play anesthetics
fit the concept,

00:59:50.910 --> 00:59:52.810
and players were quite happy.

00:59:52.810 --> 00:59:55.500
But not everything is
always happy ending,

00:59:55.500 --> 00:59:56.990
everything is perfect.

00:59:56.990 --> 01:00:00.080
There was still some confusion
about how the ultimate was

01:00:00.080 --> 01:00:01.790
supposed to work.

01:00:01.790 --> 01:00:03.950
We found that players
wanted more control of it.

01:00:03.950 --> 01:00:05.700
Basically how the
ultimate currently works

01:00:05.700 --> 01:00:09.140
is he locks his arms forward
and shoots in that direction.

01:00:09.140 --> 01:00:10.839
So if you stray
left to right, he

01:00:10.839 --> 01:00:12.630
continues shooting in
that direction which,

01:00:12.630 --> 01:00:14.570
for some players,
was pretty confusing.

01:00:14.570 --> 01:00:17.250
Now what they expected based
on some of our other champions,

01:00:17.250 --> 01:00:20.249
and it wasn't able for them
to learn it in one session.

01:00:20.249 --> 01:00:22.165
So one of the things
that we have to take away

01:00:22.165 --> 01:00:25.590
from that is labs have some
external validity problems,

01:00:25.590 --> 01:00:28.020
which basically means that
we're sitting in a lab.

01:00:28.020 --> 01:00:29.470
There's not other
players around.

01:00:29.470 --> 01:00:31.250
They're often not
playing on live.

01:00:31.250 --> 01:00:33.500
There's a lot of things that
are different in our test

01:00:33.500 --> 01:00:35.132
situations than real life.

01:00:35.132 --> 01:00:36.590
Usually, you wouldn't
try to master

01:00:36.590 --> 01:00:38.200
a champion in one session.

01:00:38.200 --> 01:00:40.380
So this is one of those
cases where we put it out

01:00:40.380 --> 01:00:43.430
to our designers and they
decided, and we supported,

01:00:43.430 --> 01:00:47.822
that he was going to be a high
skill ceiling champion, which

01:00:47.822 --> 01:00:49.780
meant that players were
going to need some time

01:00:49.780 --> 01:00:51.060
to learn how to play him.

01:00:51.060 --> 01:00:53.590
And that just because they
didn't learn him in one session

01:00:53.590 --> 01:00:55.714
didn't mean that they
wouldn't learn him over time.

01:00:59.050 --> 01:01:03.560
So this is what Lucian looked
like when he did go live.

01:01:03.560 --> 01:01:05.067
And it helps if
I play the video.

01:01:08.710 --> 01:01:10.120
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

01:01:11.060 --> 01:01:14.039
GENEVIEVE CONLEY: So
he's in the top there.

Pew, pew.

sometimes a little confusing

01:01:32.390 --> 01:01:33.806
if you don't play
the game to have

01:01:33.806 --> 01:01:36.480
to watch 10 champions all in
one little team fight like that.

01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:38.350
But ultimately, the
important part's there.

01:01:38.350 --> 01:01:40.914
He's using his ultimate
and he dashed at the end.

01:01:40.914 --> 01:01:42.580
Ultimately, ended up
actually delivering

01:01:42.580 --> 01:01:44.400
on player expectations
for this champion.

01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:45.577
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

01:01:45.577 --> 01:01:46.160
[END PLAYBACK]

01:01:46.160 --> 01:01:49.210
We don't need to
watch that again.

01:01:49.210 --> 01:01:50.440
So what did we learn?

01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:52.220
Well, we knew going
into it that Lucian

01:01:52.220 --> 01:01:54.304
was going to be a difficult
champion to get right.

01:01:54.304 --> 01:01:55.720
And we also learned
that, you know

01:01:55.720 --> 01:01:58.530
what, it's OK to take a champion
back to the lab multiple times

01:01:58.530 --> 01:02:01.837
if we really feel that
it's worth the effort.

01:02:01.837 --> 01:02:03.420
We knew that his
theme was compelling,

01:02:03.420 --> 01:02:05.700
but there was something
that wasn't just matching up

01:02:05.700 --> 01:02:08.712
between his mechanics, his
visuals, and his theme.

01:02:08.712 --> 01:02:11.170
And this is one of those things
is that everything on paper

01:02:11.170 --> 01:02:14.360
can be totally 100%
right, but if players

01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:16.547
don't agree with it or
players aren't feeling

01:02:16.547 --> 01:02:18.130
those goals that
you're trying to hit,

01:02:18.130 --> 01:02:19.830
there's going to be a problem.

01:02:19.830 --> 01:02:22.270
So we're able to collaborate
with our subject matter

01:02:22.270 --> 01:02:24.630
experts, with our
players, in order

01:02:24.630 --> 01:02:27.230
to get the experience right.

01:02:27.230 --> 01:02:30.470
And I mean, I'll say it again.

01:02:30.470 --> 01:02:32.620
Just because the mechanics
stacked up correctly

01:02:32.620 --> 01:02:34.330
does not mean that
it necessarily will

01:02:34.330 --> 01:02:37.020
in the feeling, which is why
you play test it in house,

01:02:37.020 --> 01:02:39.280
why you play test it with
other people at your studio

01:02:39.280 --> 01:02:41.630
or at your school, and
ideally, why you test it

01:02:41.630 --> 01:02:44.650
with the people who are actually
going to play your game.

01:02:44.650 --> 01:02:46.780
And then we also learned
that you can sometimes

01:02:46.780 --> 01:02:48.280
have these trade-offs.

01:02:48.280 --> 01:02:51.060
It goes back to what
you hear from players.

01:02:51.060 --> 01:02:52.950
Sometimes they're going
to make suggestions

01:02:52.950 --> 01:02:55.140
and you have to look for
the note behind the note.

01:02:55.140 --> 01:02:56.904
It's like, what is
actually the problem?

01:02:56.904 --> 01:02:58.570
You guys are the
subject matter experts.

01:02:58.570 --> 01:03:00.819
You're going to be able to
look at what they're saying

01:03:00.819 --> 01:03:03.820
and never take it as,
from players, a criticism.

01:03:03.820 --> 01:03:06.630
Always think about it as if
they said something wrong,

01:03:06.630 --> 01:03:09.170
there's something that has
to be causing the problem.

01:03:09.170 --> 01:03:11.070
What is it underneath
their note that's

01:03:11.070 --> 01:03:12.660
actually causing that problem?

01:03:12.660 --> 01:03:13.880
Let's look for that thing.

01:03:16.630 --> 01:03:18.850
And we're still
iterating after launch.

01:03:18.850 --> 01:03:21.590
That's one thing that's typical
with our champions is that yes,

01:03:21.590 --> 01:03:22.840
we do play tests with players.

01:03:22.840 --> 01:03:25.160
Yes, we do play tests in house.

01:03:25.160 --> 01:03:27.300
But once we launch
the champion, there

01:03:27.300 --> 01:03:29.600
are thousands and
thousands of play tests

01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:31.699
with real players on live.

01:03:31.699 --> 01:03:33.990
And that's when we learn
about things that happen maybe

01:03:33.990 --> 01:03:37.080
at scale or under very
specific situations,

01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:38.900
or for things that we
didn't account for,

01:03:38.900 --> 01:03:41.330
for these external
validity concerns.

01:03:41.330 --> 01:03:43.020
So we keep iterating.

01:03:43.020 --> 01:03:44.640
And in the case of
Lucian, we actually

01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:47.360
continue to collect
metrics and user sentiment

01:03:47.360 --> 01:03:49.570
through things like surveys
and through game data

01:03:49.570 --> 01:03:51.309
to understand how he was doing.

01:03:51.309 --> 01:03:52.850
And based on this,
we're able to make

01:03:52.850 --> 01:03:54.990
more iterations, fine
tune, and hopefully

01:03:54.990 --> 01:03:57.300
make him a little
bit more accessible.

01:03:57.300 --> 01:03:59.790
And today, Lucian is well
regarded, widely played.

01:03:59.790 --> 01:04:01.520
And if you watch the
professional matches

01:04:01.520 --> 01:04:04.364
in the world championship,
he's use quite frequently.

01:04:04.364 --> 01:04:06.280
All right, you guys, I
hope I didn't bore you.

01:04:06.280 --> 01:04:07.491
My name is Genevieve, again.

01:04:07.491 --> 01:04:08.990
If you guys ever
have any questions,

01:04:08.990 --> 01:04:12.510
you can feel free to reach out
to me at gconley@riotgames.com.

01:04:12.510 --> 01:04:15.190
My Summoner name in game, if
you play, is RiotCapernoited.

01:04:15.190 --> 01:04:16.510
And you can also find
me on Twitter there.

01:04:16.510 --> 01:04:18.051
I'm always happy to
answer questions.

01:04:18.051 --> 01:04:19.284
Thank you guys.

01:04:19.284 --> 01:04:23.140
[APPLAUSE]

01:04:27.960 --> 01:04:30.870
AUDIENCE: We get
a 10 minute break.

01:04:30.870 --> 01:04:33.840
PROFESSOR: So 10 minute break.

01:04:33.840 --> 01:04:38.110
Come back at 2:20 and be ready
to start working on your focus

01:04:38.110 --> 01:04:40.320
test stuff.

01:04:40.320 --> 01:04:43.790
OK, welcome back to class.

01:04:46.590 --> 01:04:49.180
Now that you've had a chance
to be talked at a whole lot,

01:04:49.180 --> 01:04:54.090
we're going to go ahead
and ask you to actually do.

01:04:54.090 --> 01:04:57.660
The plan is to give you about 10
minutes to meet in your groups,

01:04:57.660 --> 01:04:59.940
plan your test.

01:04:59.940 --> 01:05:01.850
I actually strongly
recommend you just grab

01:05:01.850 --> 01:05:05.250
a copy of the focus test,
either in the Word version

01:05:05.250 --> 01:05:06.800
or the RTF version
of off Stellar

01:05:06.800 --> 01:05:08.810
so you've got that as a guide.

01:05:08.810 --> 01:05:12.712
Sit down, plan your test and
how you're going to run it.

01:05:12.712 --> 01:05:14.170
We'll give you 10
minutes for that.

01:05:14.170 --> 01:05:16.710
Then we'll have about
45 minutes for people

01:05:16.710 --> 01:05:18.010
to circulate and test.

01:05:18.010 --> 01:05:20.051
And one of the things you
should also be planning

01:05:20.051 --> 01:05:21.650
is when your team
members will be

01:05:21.650 --> 01:05:24.400
out testing other people's
games and when your team members

01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:26.850
will be observing.

01:05:26.850 --> 01:05:29.860
Just given the number of people
in class, the number of games

01:05:29.860 --> 01:05:32.990
we have, and the number
of people on the team,

01:05:32.990 --> 01:05:35.560
chances are good that you aren't
going to be either observing

01:05:35.560 --> 01:05:37.560
or testing all the time.

01:05:37.560 --> 01:05:40.410
You're probably going
to have to wait.

01:05:40.410 --> 01:05:42.380
But go ahead and
circulate, take the time

01:05:42.380 --> 01:05:45.190
to watch other teams
doing focus testing.

01:05:45.190 --> 01:05:48.200
Try not to watch
a game in progress

01:05:48.200 --> 01:05:51.140
that you're going to focus test.

01:05:51.140 --> 01:05:53.230
If you realize that
you're just sitting

01:05:53.230 --> 01:05:54.980
around waiting for a
chance to focus test,

01:05:54.980 --> 01:05:57.630
let the team know that
you're in line next.

01:05:57.630 --> 01:06:00.540
I'd rather you pulled
out a book and read it

01:06:00.540 --> 01:06:02.830
than watched someone
else play a game

01:06:02.830 --> 01:06:04.120
you're about to focus test.

01:06:04.120 --> 01:06:06.328
It will be more useful for
the poor people who you're

01:06:06.328 --> 01:06:08.430
testing for if you
haven't already seen

01:06:08.430 --> 01:06:10.521
somebody do all those things.

01:06:10.521 --> 01:06:12.020
That doesn't mean
hide in the corner

01:06:12.020 --> 01:06:14.930
and read a book because
there's too many people

01:06:14.930 --> 01:06:16.580
wandering around testing games.

01:06:16.580 --> 01:06:20.250
We do expect everybody to
participate both sides.

01:06:20.250 --> 01:06:22.180
Observe and test.

01:06:22.180 --> 01:06:25.020
So try to balance
that out a bit.

01:06:25.020 --> 01:06:27.250
We'll circulate and
keep an eye on things.

01:06:27.250 --> 01:06:29.690
And if it looks like at
some point nobody's actually

01:06:29.690 --> 01:06:32.550
testing, you're all sitting
around twiddling your thumbs,

01:06:32.550 --> 01:06:33.390
we'll end it early.

01:06:33.390 --> 01:06:36.400
I don't know how long
this testing session will

01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:40.580
take because we haven't had
such large teams on this project

01:06:40.580 --> 01:06:41.080
before.

01:06:41.080 --> 01:06:44.330
So it's a little harder for me
to know what the amount of time

01:06:44.330 --> 01:06:46.570
is.

01:06:46.570 --> 01:06:48.310
After that, we'll give
you some more time

01:06:48.310 --> 01:06:51.280
to talk in your own
teams and come up

01:06:51.280 --> 01:06:54.084
with the what are the results of
your test to analyze your data.

01:06:54.084 --> 01:06:55.750
And then we'll ask
somebody to come down

01:06:55.750 --> 01:06:58.440
and for each team give us the
summary of your focus test

01:06:58.440 --> 01:06:59.456
report.

01:06:59.456 --> 01:07:00.830
How did your focus
test turn out?

01:07:00.830 --> 01:07:01.622
What did you learn?

01:07:01.622 --> 01:07:03.913
Do you have a plan for what
you're going to do with it,

01:07:03.913 --> 01:07:06.510
or are you still figuring
out how you'll deal with it?

01:07:06.510 --> 01:07:08.200
Those are all
reasonable things given

01:07:08.200 --> 01:07:10.640
you only had 10 minutes
to look at your data.

01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:11.140
Thank you.

01:07:11.140 --> 01:07:13.700
It is 2:23.

01:07:13.700 --> 01:07:18.631
At 2:33, we'll go ahead
and start focus testing.

01:07:18.631 --> 01:07:20.380
Actually, I'm going
to give you 15 minutes

01:07:20.380 --> 01:07:22.505
to get set up, because I
just realized you probably

01:07:22.505 --> 01:07:25.652
need 10 minutes to talk and
then probably five minutes

01:07:25.652 --> 01:07:27.610
to make sure you have a
machine up and running.

01:07:27.610 --> 01:07:30.920
So I apologize, it's going
to be 15 minutes to plan

01:07:30.920 --> 01:07:33.170
and prepare for your test.

01:07:33.170 --> 01:07:37.258
So that's 2:38 at this point.

01:07:37.258 --> 01:07:41.250
[CHATTER]

01:07:52.126 --> 01:07:52.750
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:07:52.750 --> 01:07:53.930
I think he just wants to--

01:07:53.930 --> 01:07:54.610
PROFESSOR: OK.

01:07:54.610 --> 01:07:58.080
You should be ready
to go now, I hope.

01:07:58.080 --> 01:08:00.650
And actively go ahead.

01:08:00.650 --> 01:08:03.070
You should have a
computer ideally set up

01:08:03.070 --> 01:08:05.170
to run your game.

01:08:05.170 --> 01:08:08.200
Who is actually ready
to run a focus test?

01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:10.740
PHILIP TAN: Everyone who
is manning a demo computer,

01:08:10.740 --> 01:08:15.130
a computer ready to run
the game, put your hand up.

01:08:15.130 --> 01:08:16.910
All stand up so
that we can see you.

01:08:16.910 --> 01:08:17.445
PROFESSOR: Yeah, go
ahead and stay up so

01:08:17.445 --> 01:08:18.980
we can see where you are.

01:08:18.980 --> 01:08:20.480
PHILIP TAN: I'm not
seeing any hands

01:08:20.480 --> 01:08:22.230
from these teams over here.

01:08:22.230 --> 01:08:22.729
OK.

01:08:22.729 --> 01:08:23.000
All right.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:23.240
All right.

01:08:23.240 --> 01:08:23.740
All right.

01:08:23.740 --> 01:08:26.970
As I said that, someone
is standing up back there.

01:08:26.970 --> 01:08:30.997
How about the Sparkly
Redemption team?

01:08:30.997 --> 01:08:31.580
OK, all right.

01:08:31.580 --> 01:08:32.870
There's someone
there to run a game.

01:08:32.870 --> 01:08:33.470
All right.

01:08:33.470 --> 01:08:35.290
PROFESSOR: So close
all the laptops

01:08:35.290 --> 01:08:38.990
that are not actually running
the game would be my advice,

01:08:38.990 --> 01:08:43.160
and then let's go
ahead and get started.

01:08:43.160 --> 01:08:44.160
PHILIP TAN: All right.

01:08:44.160 --> 01:08:45.770
Start playing each
other's games.

01:08:45.770 --> 01:08:46.270
Go.

01:08:46.270 --> 01:08:47.758
PROFESSOR: Yep.

01:08:47.758 --> 01:08:52.222
[CHATTER]

01:09:02.280 --> 01:09:04.696
PROFESSOR: Next time, we'll
ask them to have two or three.

01:09:04.696 --> 01:09:06.640
PHILIP TAN: Yeah.

01:09:06.640 --> 01:09:09.149
PROFESSOR: As part
of the Stellar thing.

01:09:09.149 --> 01:09:10.428
He was talking about the--

01:09:10.428 --> 01:09:14.332
AUDIENCE: I got
the FOA for free.

01:09:14.332 --> 01:09:14.915
PROFESSOR: OK.

01:09:19.330 --> 01:09:22.170
It's OK if you don't
have a plan of action

01:09:22.170 --> 01:09:23.600
as you're looking
at your results

01:09:23.600 --> 01:09:27.660
as long as you've gotten ideas
to what you're seeing out

01:09:27.660 --> 01:09:29.300
of your data.

01:09:29.300 --> 01:09:32.424
It's hard to look at your
data, get it evaluated,

01:09:32.424 --> 01:09:33.840
talk about it, and
figure out what

01:09:33.840 --> 01:09:35.569
you're going to do about
it all in 10 minutes.

01:09:35.569 --> 01:09:38.000
We are giving you a short
amount of time because we're

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.229
running out of time.

01:09:40.229 --> 01:09:42.464
That said, let's get started
with Sparkly Redemption.

01:09:45.179 --> 01:09:47.629
[APPLAUSE]

01:09:47.629 --> 01:09:49.589
AUDIENCE: So we
had a small hiccup

01:09:49.589 --> 01:09:52.845
when we started where we didn't
have-- part of our core game

01:09:52.845 --> 01:09:55.469
is collecting sparklies, and we
didn't have a version with that

01:09:55.469 --> 01:09:56.800
when we started play testing.

01:09:56.800 --> 01:09:59.050
So we actually got to test
out some different movement

01:09:59.050 --> 01:10:00.425
controls that we
were trying out,

01:10:00.425 --> 01:10:03.390
which actually turned out to
be good because the controls

01:10:03.390 --> 01:10:05.786
that we liked, which was
right clicking with the mouse

01:10:05.786 --> 01:10:07.871
and then left clicking
to shoot, a lot of people

01:10:07.871 --> 01:10:09.463
had a lot of trouble with that.

01:10:09.463 --> 01:10:12.925
So it was a good thing that
we messed up and then got

01:10:12.925 --> 01:10:14.590
some information from that.

01:10:14.590 --> 01:10:17.650
Then we got a version
with sparklies working,

01:10:17.650 --> 01:10:20.660
and there was a big bug where
if you killed all the monsters,

01:10:20.660 --> 01:10:21.990
they never respond.

01:10:21.990 --> 01:10:24.972
So that bug has now been
fixed in the last 10 minutes,

01:10:24.972 --> 01:10:26.463
so that was good.

01:10:26.463 --> 01:10:30.594
Other than we, we got just
random things like people

01:10:30.594 --> 01:10:32.260
staying in the corner
and just shooting,

01:10:32.260 --> 01:10:34.970
as opposed to just moving around
the map like we want them to.

01:10:34.970 --> 01:10:38.357
So we have a few problems that
we have to figure out that.

01:10:38.357 --> 01:10:41.351
Right now, we don't
know the answers.

01:10:41.351 --> 01:10:44.844
[APPLAUSE]

01:10:50.333 --> 01:10:51.097
AUDIENCE: Hi.

01:10:51.097 --> 01:10:52.180
I'm with Lost Underground.

01:10:52.180 --> 01:10:54.385
As a refresher on
our game, the idea

01:10:54.385 --> 01:10:57.472
is that you are lost underground
in the darkness trying

01:10:57.472 --> 01:10:58.602
to find an exit.

01:10:58.602 --> 01:11:02.665
And so as part of our
game, we have this sphere

01:11:02.665 --> 01:11:04.418
of visibility around you.

01:11:04.418 --> 01:11:07.490
And as we play tested, we
got a lot of good feedback

01:11:07.490 --> 01:11:09.935
on what that visibility
means to people

01:11:09.935 --> 01:11:12.883
and how we can
actually use it to make

01:11:12.883 --> 01:11:15.751
our mechanics and our
[INAUDIBLE] design

01:11:15.751 --> 01:11:16.950
more compelling.

01:11:16.950 --> 01:11:19.614
Another big issue we
ran into with people

01:11:19.614 --> 01:11:24.035
play testing was
our collision boxes

01:11:24.035 --> 01:11:25.430
are basically pixel perfect.

01:11:25.430 --> 01:11:27.180
And so people would
get caught trying

01:11:27.180 --> 01:11:32.370
to go through the map, which
was really helpful for us,

01:11:32.370 --> 01:11:35.017
because although we already
knew that this problem existed,

01:11:35.017 --> 01:11:37.350
we actually learned a lot
about how people were actually

01:11:37.350 --> 01:11:38.844
trying to make these decisions.

01:11:38.844 --> 01:11:40.587
And we learned that
instead of using

01:11:40.587 --> 01:11:43.630
the idea of the entire
[INAUDIBLE], a lot of players

01:11:43.630 --> 01:11:46.330
were actually looking at
where the feet were planted

01:11:46.330 --> 01:11:47.776
and trying to move
based on that.

01:11:47.776 --> 01:11:50.186
So when we go and
fix it, we'll make

01:11:50.186 --> 01:11:53.240
sure to put the collision box
around where the feet are.

01:11:53.240 --> 01:11:56.335
We also got a lot of good
feedback on the items

01:11:56.335 --> 01:11:58.584
that we have in our game and
where people are actually

01:11:58.584 --> 01:12:01.310
focusing their attention.

01:12:01.310 --> 01:12:04.677
[APPLAUSE]

01:12:08.044 --> 01:12:09.390
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:12:09.390 --> 01:12:10.602
PROFESSOR: Oh, Plunder Winds.

01:12:10.602 --> 01:12:11.102
Yeah.

01:12:17.130 --> 01:12:22.322
AUDIENCE: So our game
involves moving around a grid

01:12:22.322 --> 01:12:24.210
and running into
random encounters.

01:12:27.167 --> 01:12:28.875
The favorability of
the random encounters

01:12:28.875 --> 01:12:32.230
are indicated to the player
by numbers and colors

01:12:32.230 --> 01:12:33.770
on the board.

01:12:33.770 --> 01:12:36.675
So one of the biggest things
that we got from testing

01:12:36.675 --> 01:12:38.100
was that people
didn't understand

01:12:38.100 --> 01:12:39.808
the role of the numbers
and colors played

01:12:39.808 --> 01:12:42.486
or how they were related
or if they were related.

01:12:42.486 --> 01:12:49.025
And they began by moving around
randomly and just waiting

01:12:49.025 --> 01:12:51.138
for things to happen to them.

01:12:51.138 --> 01:12:52.596
There's also a
mechanic in our game

01:12:52.596 --> 01:12:57.347
that involves moving with the
wind and against the wind.

01:12:57.347 --> 01:12:59.430
And so moving with the
wind doesn't count stamina,

01:12:59.430 --> 01:13:02.604
but moving against
the wind does.

01:13:02.604 --> 01:13:04.666
Or moving sideways
of the wind does.

01:13:04.666 --> 01:13:06.332
Moving against the
wind is not possible.

01:13:06.332 --> 01:13:09.110
People had trouble
figuring that out as well.

01:13:09.110 --> 01:13:11.735
So one of the biggest things
we're going to try and do

01:13:11.735 --> 01:13:15.550
is more visual
feedback to the player,

01:13:15.550 --> 01:13:18.352
help them figure
things out as it goes.

01:13:18.352 --> 01:13:19.810
Also, people felt
like there should

01:13:19.810 --> 01:13:23.710
be more long-term consequences
instead of just planning

01:13:23.710 --> 01:13:25.323
for the next move or two.

01:13:25.323 --> 01:13:27.788
And so we're going to see
how we can integrate that

01:13:27.788 --> 01:13:30.253
into our game.

01:13:30.253 --> 01:13:33.704
[APPLAUSE]

01:13:39.620 --> 01:13:40.606
AUDIENCE: Hi.

01:13:40.606 --> 01:13:41.592
Blind Aliens.

01:13:41.592 --> 01:13:43.564
So we got a lot
of great feedback

01:13:43.564 --> 01:13:45.740
from the use play testing.

01:13:45.740 --> 01:13:47.440
So one of the main
things we realized

01:13:47.440 --> 01:13:52.148
is we needed more clear goals
and more long-term goals.

01:13:52.148 --> 01:13:54.549
So for example, our gun
automatically reloads,

01:13:54.549 --> 01:13:56.298
and that was a little
confusing for people

01:13:56.298 --> 01:13:58.960
because they didn't really
see that it was reloading.

01:13:58.960 --> 01:14:00.638
But instead of doing
something like that

01:14:00.638 --> 01:14:02.198
where the gun
automatically reloads,

01:14:02.198 --> 01:14:04.772
we're thinking of adding
bullets around that you

01:14:04.772 --> 01:14:08.490
have to go and collect so it's
more short-term goals and also

01:14:08.490 --> 01:14:09.316
long-term strategy.

01:14:09.316 --> 01:14:12.274
How do you save your bullets
up, when do you use them all.

01:14:12.274 --> 01:14:14.037
Another thing we noticed
was that our game

01:14:14.037 --> 01:14:15.620
was way too hard at
first, and way too

01:14:15.620 --> 01:14:17.069
easy after five minutes.

01:14:17.069 --> 01:14:20.450
So we decided we need to focus
on ramping up the difficulty.

01:14:20.450 --> 01:14:22.623
Instead of starting with
three aliens attacking you,

01:14:22.623 --> 01:14:23.706
maybe only one.

01:14:23.706 --> 01:14:26.080
And then maybe after five
minutes, instead of only having

01:14:26.080 --> 01:14:28.590
three aliens, maybe 10.

01:14:28.590 --> 01:14:32.130
[INAUDIBLE] difficult.

01:14:32.130 --> 01:14:37.486
So another thing we
focused on was our AI.

01:14:37.486 --> 01:14:38.325
Not AI.

01:14:38.325 --> 01:14:39.400
User interface.

01:14:39.400 --> 01:14:42.220
So I talked about how there
was a reloading thing,

01:14:42.220 --> 01:14:44.255
it was flashing in the
corner, but no one saw it

01:14:44.255 --> 01:14:46.250
so no one knew that
their gun was reloading.

01:14:46.250 --> 01:14:48.400
They thought it
just wasn't working

01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:50.677
and they were frustrated
that they were clicking

01:14:50.677 --> 01:14:51.760
and nothing was happening.

01:14:51.760 --> 01:14:53.790
So we need to make
that more visual.

01:14:53.790 --> 01:14:56.245
Along with our aliens,
when they're half-dead

01:14:56.245 --> 01:14:57.610
or they're still attacking you.

01:14:57.610 --> 01:14:58.860
People thought they were dead.

01:14:58.860 --> 01:15:01.580
They'd run into them and
they'd die and be frustrated.

01:15:01.580 --> 01:15:04.940
So instead of maybe
turning them darker,

01:15:04.940 --> 01:15:07.830
maybe turn them red or something
like that to make that clearer.

01:15:07.830 --> 01:15:09.889
So thank you guys
for all the feedback.

01:15:09.889 --> 01:15:13.200
[APPLAUSE]

01:15:14.237 --> 01:15:15.070
PROFESSOR: Modudice.

01:15:21.171 --> 01:15:23.130
AUDIENCE: Hi, we're Modudice.

01:15:23.130 --> 01:15:26.105
So a lot of the feedback we
got was really based on our UI.

01:15:26.105 --> 01:15:32.070
And it's because we're modeling
a 3-D die using 2-D graphics.

01:15:32.070 --> 01:15:34.447
So a lot of people
have different opinions

01:15:34.447 --> 01:15:36.030
about how that should
look, and no one

01:15:36.030 --> 01:15:38.477
thought that the way
it does look is OK.

01:15:38.477 --> 01:15:39.760
[INAUDIBLE]

01:15:39.760 --> 01:15:42.913
And so we really got
a lot of opinions.

01:15:42.913 --> 01:15:44.204
Maybe you could do it this way.

01:15:44.204 --> 01:15:45.495
Maybe you could do it this way.

01:15:45.495 --> 01:15:47.876
And that really
helps, because now we

01:15:47.876 --> 01:15:50.230
can really build up a discussion
of how it should look.

01:15:50.230 --> 01:15:52.820
How we can make this mental
model in people's heads

01:15:52.820 --> 01:15:54.750
match what they're seeing
on the screen, which

01:15:54.750 --> 01:15:57.180
is the real hard challenge
that we're facing.

01:15:57.180 --> 01:15:59.610
So thanks for the feedback.

01:15:59.610 --> 01:16:03.500
[APPLAUSE]

01:16:03.500 --> 01:16:05.850
PROFESSOR: Beaver Evolution.

01:16:05.850 --> 01:16:08.350
PHILIP TAN: I told them it
was going to be the problem,

01:16:08.350 --> 01:16:10.850
someone needs to go up.

01:16:10.850 --> 01:16:12.850
AUDIENCE: So through
play testing,

01:16:12.850 --> 01:16:16.580
we really realized that we
weren't conveying to the user

01:16:16.580 --> 01:16:19.424
exactly why all the
instructions worked clearly

01:16:19.424 --> 01:16:21.492
and what was happening
at each turn.

01:16:21.492 --> 01:16:25.160
But otherwise, the game
mechanics worked pretty well.

01:16:25.160 --> 01:16:27.640
So in Beaver Evolution,
you can choose

01:16:27.640 --> 01:16:29.282
whether to build,
populate, or evolve,

01:16:29.282 --> 01:16:31.247
but it wasn't
clear to the player

01:16:31.247 --> 01:16:32.955
exactly how many
beavers you can populate

01:16:32.955 --> 01:16:34.730
or how many dams
you could build,

01:16:34.730 --> 01:16:37.720
or what natural
disasters could happen.

01:16:37.720 --> 01:16:41.526
And then between each turn, when
a natural disaster happened,

01:16:41.526 --> 01:16:43.020
there wasn't that
much engagement

01:16:43.020 --> 01:16:45.880
between the player and
the game being like,

01:16:45.880 --> 01:16:48.302
oh, this drought
happened and then

01:16:48.302 --> 01:16:50.470
this is a consequence of that.

01:16:50.470 --> 01:16:53.970
So I think going forward,
we're going to really try

01:16:53.970 --> 01:16:57.399
to make it easier for players
to understand what happened

01:16:57.399 --> 01:16:59.864
during that turn, and then
what their choices are

01:16:59.864 --> 01:17:01.343
in terms of picking it.

01:17:01.343 --> 01:17:04.794
So a lot of it is clarifying
what the instructions are,

01:17:04.794 --> 01:17:07.752
what the game mechanics are.

01:17:07.752 --> 01:17:11.203
[APPLAUSE]

01:17:12.304 --> 01:17:13.720
PROFESSOR: And
finally, Comcastic.

01:17:19.674 --> 01:17:21.132
AUDIENCE: Well,
the two main pieces

01:17:21.132 --> 01:17:22.632
of feedback that
we got from players

01:17:22.632 --> 01:17:24.940
were about the UI of the game.

01:17:24.940 --> 01:17:27.450
And we had some issues with
that because our game has

01:17:27.450 --> 01:17:30.354
a lot of complex UI
requirements and we

01:17:30.354 --> 01:17:33.711
didn't have time to implement
all of those prior to this test

01:17:33.711 --> 01:17:34.211
session.

01:17:34.211 --> 01:17:36.760
But we did get a lot of feedback
about UI improvements that

01:17:36.760 --> 01:17:39.445
would make it easier
for players to see what

01:17:39.445 --> 01:17:40.840
was going on with the game.

01:17:40.840 --> 01:17:42.381
For example,
highlighting houses that

01:17:42.381 --> 01:17:44.570
are currently being served
by a [? source ?] center.

01:17:44.570 --> 01:17:46.070
The other main
complaint that we got

01:17:46.070 --> 01:17:48.597
was that the game is
nebulous right now.

01:17:48.597 --> 01:17:50.096
There's not a whole
lot of challenge

01:17:50.096 --> 01:17:51.203
or clearly defined goal.

01:17:51.203 --> 01:17:52.676
And so one thing
that we're really

01:17:52.676 --> 01:17:56.390
going to look at
going forward is

01:17:56.390 --> 01:17:59.470
tightening the focus of the
game, addling more tension,

01:17:59.470 --> 01:18:02.026
and making the goal of
the game more concrete.

01:18:02.026 --> 01:18:06.328
And since it doesn't fit very
well into an established genre,

01:18:06.328 --> 01:18:08.847
we had some more
complex design decisions

01:18:08.847 --> 01:18:11.556
to figure out how to make
this a fun and engaging game.

01:18:11.556 --> 01:18:13.055
And so that's pretty
much what we're

01:18:13.055 --> 01:18:15.035
going to be focusing
on going forward,

01:18:15.035 --> 01:18:18.005
would be the UI and adding
more challenge and tension

01:18:18.005 --> 01:18:20.975
to the game.

01:18:20.975 --> 01:18:22.460
[APPLAUSE]

01:18:22.460 --> 01:18:23.945
PHILIP TAN: I have a few words.

01:18:23.945 --> 01:18:25.879
Do you have anything to say?

01:18:25.879 --> 01:18:26.920
PROFESSOR: You go for it.

01:18:26.920 --> 01:18:27.545
PHILIP TAN: OK.

01:18:27.545 --> 01:18:29.110
So I just want to
remind everybody

01:18:29.110 --> 01:18:33.701
that you started on this
project less than 10 days ago.

01:18:33.701 --> 01:18:34.200
OK.

01:18:34.200 --> 01:18:37.300
And you just finished your
first playable prototype,

01:18:37.300 --> 01:18:38.620
and you did a good test.

01:18:38.620 --> 01:18:40.170
So give yourself a hand.

01:18:40.170 --> 01:18:43.110
[APPLAUSE]

01:18:45.570 --> 01:18:46.380
Let's see.

01:18:46.380 --> 01:18:48.230
Things to keep in mind.

01:18:48.230 --> 01:18:51.400
For those of you who are
making mouse-driven games,

01:18:51.400 --> 01:18:53.500
you want to make sure
that you have enough mice

01:18:53.500 --> 01:18:59.530
to have for your next play test
which will be probably project

01:18:59.530 --> 01:19:01.490
three.

01:19:01.490 --> 01:19:04.560
And you've only got
another five days,

01:19:04.560 --> 01:19:08.500
if I'm not mistaken,
when this is done.

01:19:08.500 --> 01:19:12.210
This is exactly a
two week project.

01:19:12.210 --> 01:19:15.300
So if you haven't
started cutting features,

01:19:15.300 --> 01:19:17.640
this is probably
the time to do it.

01:19:17.640 --> 01:19:19.980
Let's see.

01:19:19.980 --> 01:19:22.620
Something that, of course,
we did notice and you all

01:19:22.620 --> 01:19:26.040
felt it was that there weren't
enough stations for playing

01:19:26.040 --> 01:19:27.110
the games.

01:19:27.110 --> 01:19:30.840
For future play tests,
for project three onwards,

01:19:30.840 --> 01:19:37.880
we are going to expect at least
half as many game computers

01:19:37.880 --> 01:19:41.030
as you have at the
average team size.

01:19:41.030 --> 01:19:43.640
So I'm not sure whether
we're doing with teams of six

01:19:43.640 --> 01:19:45.310
or teams of eight.

01:19:45.310 --> 01:19:49.070
We're doing teams of six
for project three, which

01:19:49.070 --> 01:19:50.610
means each team
should be prepared

01:19:50.610 --> 01:19:54.020
to have at least three computers
running with the games.

01:19:54.020 --> 01:19:56.540
Something else that
we're also going

01:19:56.540 --> 01:20:00.430
to make it a lot clearer
where the game stations are

01:20:00.430 --> 01:20:04.050
is that the computers that are
not being used for game play

01:20:04.050 --> 01:20:05.400
should actually just be closed.

01:20:05.400 --> 01:20:08.275
Take notes using paper, because
it gets confusing to figure out

01:20:08.275 --> 01:20:10.900
which are the game stations and
which ones are just like people

01:20:10.900 --> 01:20:14.440
taking notes and which ones are
the ones where people actually

01:20:14.440 --> 01:20:17.524
coding on the sly trying to
fix last minute problems.

01:20:17.524 --> 01:20:19.940
You really should have all
that sorted out before the play

01:20:19.940 --> 01:20:21.520
test, not during the play test.

01:20:22.620 --> 01:20:24.880
So next time when
we're doing play test,

01:20:24.880 --> 01:20:28.470
just make sure that half
your team, basically,

01:20:28.470 --> 01:20:30.760
is ready to go with the game.

01:20:30.760 --> 01:20:32.370
And I would suggest
more than half

01:20:32.370 --> 01:20:35.100
your team should be able to
run the code, just in case

01:20:35.100 --> 01:20:37.710
someone falls sick, right?

01:20:37.710 --> 01:20:41.180
And doesn't bring their
computer or their mouse.

01:20:41.180 --> 01:20:45.050
Rest of the class is for you
to work on your own team.

01:20:45.050 --> 01:20:48.410
If anyone hasn't signed
into the attendance sheet,

01:20:48.410 --> 01:20:49.860
we still have it up here.

01:20:49.860 --> 01:20:55.810
And I want to have everyone
give the folks from Riot

01:20:55.810 --> 01:20:58.320
a big hand for coming and
giving their feedback.

01:20:58.320 --> 01:21:00.260
[APPLAUSE]

01:21:00.260 --> 01:21:02.685
Thank you.

01:21:02.685 --> 01:21:04.150
GENEVIEVE CONLEY: [INAUDIBLE].

01:21:04.150 --> 01:21:04.983
PHILIP TAN: Oh, yes.

01:21:04.983 --> 01:21:07.705
They have lots of information
about internships.

01:21:07.705 --> 01:21:08.205
Oops.

01:21:08.205 --> 01:21:08.770
Oh, whoa.

01:21:08.770 --> 01:21:12.720
A very, very large stack of
documents and positions that

01:21:12.720 --> 01:21:13.430
are available.

01:21:13.430 --> 01:21:14.940
And a deadline,
October 15th, which

01:21:14.940 --> 01:21:17.730
is not that long from now.

01:21:17.730 --> 01:21:21.930
So definitely check those
out as soon as you can.

01:21:21.930 --> 01:21:22.670
Let's see.

01:21:22.670 --> 01:21:24.690
Actually, while
we're on internships,

01:21:24.690 --> 01:21:28.400
there's one other thing
that I wanted to mention.

01:21:28.400 --> 01:21:32.510
I sent out a message for
Europe over in AeroAstro.

01:21:32.510 --> 01:21:36.260
They are looking
for game developers.

01:21:36.260 --> 01:21:38.410
Even better if you
also know MATLAB,

01:21:38.410 --> 01:21:41.530
but they just want
game developers

01:21:41.530 --> 01:21:43.710
for a high school
science competition

01:21:43.710 --> 01:21:46.139
that they're running.

01:21:46.139 --> 01:21:47.180
It's like first robotics.

01:21:47.180 --> 01:21:50.180
It's a robotics competition,
only in zero gravity.

01:21:50.180 --> 01:21:53.320
So if that sounds cool,
you should definitely

01:21:53.320 --> 01:21:56.630
respond to them quickly because
Europe deadlines are coming up.

01:21:56.630 --> 01:22:01.600
And that's it.

01:22:01.600 --> 01:22:03.450
See you [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:05.900
Conditional probabilities are
like ordinary probabilities,

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:08.680
except that they apply to a
new situation where some

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:11.210
additional information
is available.

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:14.850
For this reason, any concept
relevant to probability models

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:17.520
has a counterpart
that applies to

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.050
conditional probability models.

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.230
In this spirit, we can define
a notion of conditional

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:27.440
independence, which is nothing
but the notion of independence

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:29.840
applied to a conditional
model.

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:31.720
Let us be more specific.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.590
Suppose that we have a
probability model and two

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:42.190
events, A and B. We are then
told that event C occurred,

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:44.690
and we construct a conditional
model.

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.250
Conditional independence
is defined as ordinary

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.100
independence but with respect
to the conditional

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.430
probabilities.

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:56.420
To be more precise, remember
that independence is defined

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.710
in terms of this relation, that
the probability of two

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.840
events happening is the product
of the probabilities

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.780
that one of them is happening
times the probability that the

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.890
other one is happening.

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.240
This is the definition of
independence in the original

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.350
unconditional model.

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.950
Now, in the conditional model we
just use the same relation,

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.960
but with conditional
probabilities instead of

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.050
ordinary probabilities.

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:34.190
So this is the definition of
conditional independence.

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:38.170
We may now ask, is there a
relation between independence

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.100
and conditional independence?

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.120
Does one imply the other?

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.789
Let us look at an example.

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:48.160
Suppose that we have two events
and these two events

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.320
are independent.

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.440
We then condition on another
event, C. And suppose that the

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:59.220
picture is like the
one shown here.

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.620
Are A and B conditionally
independent?

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.850
Well, in the new universe where
C has happened, events A

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:13.860
and B have no intersection.

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.290
As we discussed earlier this
means that events A and B are

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.180
extremely dependent.

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:27.240
Within G, if A occurs, this
tells us that B did not occur.

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:31.440
The conclusion from this example
is that independence

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.090
does not imply conditional
independence.

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.090
So in this particular example,
we saw that the

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.160
answer here is no.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.070
Given C, A and B are
not independent.

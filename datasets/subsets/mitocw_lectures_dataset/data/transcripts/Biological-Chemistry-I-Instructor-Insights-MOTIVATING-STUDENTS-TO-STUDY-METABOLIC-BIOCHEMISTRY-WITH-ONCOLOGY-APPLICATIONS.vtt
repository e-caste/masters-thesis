JOHN ESSIGMANN: At the end
of the course, when there's

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.590
so many pathways out there that
things start to get really,

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:15.360
really complicated,
we try to increase

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.180
the number of
physiological scenarios,

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.540
again, to try to get the
students sufficiently

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:23.310
interested in a
pathway and thinking

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:24.990
about how the whole
pathway works,

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.470
not just each individual step--

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:32.729
to get the student to like the
example so that he or she will

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:34.950
go right in there and study it.

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.380
And one of the areas that
I think really important

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:42.990
these days in basic
metabolic biochemistry

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:46.530
is in oncology-- cancer biology.

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:55.020
JoAnne mentioned that
not that many years ago,

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.560
academic programs
wondered whether teaching

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.616
metabolic pathways was
really the best use of time,

00:01:02.616 --> 00:01:03.990
because so many
other things were

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:09.030
happening in the molecular
biology revolution.

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.610
And certainly in 5.07 we decided
to maintain emphasis in this,

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.440
because we--

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.002
just because these are the
first pathways that were studied

00:01:20.002 --> 00:01:21.460
doesn't mean they
aren't important.

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:22.860
They're medically
very important.

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.570
They were originally
studied because

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.780
of medical or economic
reasons that--

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.420
fermentation, for example--
that these pathways

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.150
were right in front and center.

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:36.060
They're always very topical.

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.240
But what happened in I'd
say the last 10 years

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.220
is that there's
been a reawakening

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.170
of the understanding of how
metabolic pathways redirect

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.950
themselves in order to
accomplish disease goals--

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.760
for example, with a tumor.

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.850
And one of the things
we teach is that a tumor

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.972
is a lot like a running muscle.

00:01:56.972 --> 00:02:01.740
And Matthew Vander Heiden,
who is here in our biology

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.120
department and teaches
the comparable course

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.930
is a real expert, a
pioneer in this area.

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:13.320
But what we've learned
is that cancer cells

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.080
tend to be addicted to glucose.

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.570
They would much prefer
glucose over any other fuel.

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:25.140
In fact, they-- when you think
about what a cancer cell really

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.810
is, it's a cell
that's not terribly

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.310
different from all
our other cells.

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.950
It's acquired some
small number--

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.480
we'll call driver mutations,
maybe seven or so driver

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:34.980
mutations.

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.500
There are many more passenger
mutations, but maybe

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.700
seven or so genetic
differences that

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.670
separate it from a normal cell.

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.590
But among the things
that has happened to

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.160
it is reprogramming of
its metabolic needs.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.550
And it has acquired
the commitment

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.370
to unremitting cell division.

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.120
If you think about what's
needed for a cell to divide,

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.666
probably the principal
structural resource-- which,

00:03:02.666 --> 00:03:05.040
again, this would come from
JoAnne's part of the course--

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.090
is membranes.

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.970
You've got to recreate the
outside of the cell and all

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.640
those organelles.

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.980
And what that means is
fatty acid biosynthesis

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.890
is absolutely going
to be paramount.

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:23.970
One way that we now know that
tumors work, if you understand

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.940
all the pathways, is a
tumor will consume glucose,

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.080
it will convert that
glucose to acetyl-CoA.

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:36.330
The acetyl-CoA takes a ride on
the molecule citrate until it

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.270
gets put out into the cytoplasm,
and then in the cytoplasm it

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:42.450
becomes a factory
for producing--

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.000
out of acetyl-CoA, it
produces the lipids

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.850
that are necessary
for membranogenesis.

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:51.630
That's absolutely critical
for cancer cell development.

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:54.760
Now, the reason that's important
is that understanding it,

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.280
it tells us that,
well, there are

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.900
certain enzymes in the pathway.

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.650
One of them is called
ATP citrate lyase.

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.600
Another one is
called malic enzyme.

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.060
So, when you look at the
charts, you'll see these things.

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:10.350
These are enzymes that are
necessary for cell division,

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:13.240
because they're necessary
for fatty acid biosynthesis,

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:14.970
and they represent
good targets--

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:20.029
next-generation targets--
for cancer chemotherapy.

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:23.230
A normal cell, you can
tell it not to divide,

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:25.202
and it won't divide.

00:04:25.202 --> 00:04:27.410
But if you can tell a cell
that's committed to divide

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:30.510
and you tell it not to
divide, oftentimes that cell

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:32.290
will kill itself.

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:36.000
So by blocking these
critical points--

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.620
test points, we'll call them,
in this metabolic chart--

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:45.010
you're able to selectively kill
cancer cells-- we hope, anyway.

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:47.520
But this study of
metabolic biochemistry

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.880
has identified
these new targets.

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.760
Another thing that's, I
think, an important anecdote

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:59.010
about cancer cells is that
they need other cells in order

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:00.720
to survive.

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:05.760
If you think about the
problems that a tumor faces--

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:09.570
remember, it started
from a normal cell

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:12.390
that acquired new mutations,
converted into a cancer cell,

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:15.360
and then started to
grow out into a tumor.

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:19.440
As it grows, it becomes more
remotely placed relative

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.630
to the blood supply.

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:23.550
OK, now, certainly there
will be a response,

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:27.750
and the blood supply will try
to grow toward the tumor cells.

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:30.750
But the core of a
tumor is hypoxic.

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:33.510
It doesn't have enough oxygen
to do real respiration.

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:36.390
So, what happens
is, the cancer cell

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:40.880
tries to hard-wire the
glycolysis pathway to be on.

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:44.630
And rough estimates are that
through this-- initially,

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:48.150
a hypoxia-inducing factor, which
is a transcription factor-- you

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:51.870
get an upregulation by 10
to 20-fold of almost all

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:54.520
of the enzymes of the
glycolytic pathway.

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:56.190
So, what happens
is, the cancer cell

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:58.300
becomes a specialist
at glycolysis.

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:01.460
It does high-throughput
glycolysis-- glucose

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:02.820
to pyruvate.

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:05.760
But, again, we don't have
the metabolic equipment

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:07.440
to do a lot of--

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:14.380
we don't have the
metabolic equipment

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:19.750
to be able to do respiration
if you're removed from oxygen.

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:24.270
So, the pyruvate gets
converted into lactate.

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:28.150
Lactate gets pumped
out into the blood,

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:32.080
and, as I mentioned before,
it acidifies the blood.

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:34.420
That's what happens
with a working muscle.

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:38.270
But the tumor sends the
lactate into the blood.

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:40.380
It's picked up by the liver.

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:42.980
The liver is a specialist
in gluconeogenesis.

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:46.700
The liver then rebuilds
the lactate into glucose,

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:48.920
sends this back
out into the blood.

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:53.300
So, the tumor is then
able to re-eat the lactate

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:55.520
that it sent out.

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:58.280
So a partnership emerges
between the liver--

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:00.200
the gluconeogenic organ--

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:02.660
and the tumor.

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:06.550
So, the tumor finds
that it's fed by--

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:08.720
unwittingly-- by the liver.

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:13.150
And the liver is contributing to
providing the nutrition that's

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:15.880
eventually going to kill the
organism if something doesn't

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:16.690
go in to stop it.

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:19.570
But, again, understanding
the pathways

00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:23.410
can give you ideas with
regard to how to intervene.

00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:26.500
So, metabolic
biochemistry is pretty

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:32.950
critical to understanding
this generation's cancer

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:35.340
scientific agenda.

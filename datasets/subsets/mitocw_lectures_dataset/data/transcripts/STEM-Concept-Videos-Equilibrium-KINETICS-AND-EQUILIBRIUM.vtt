00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:08.850
If you're driving down the highway and want
to see how fast you're going, you look down

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:13.450
at your speedometer. If you're in a lab and
want to see how fast a chemical reaction is

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:18.380
going, it's a little more complicated. In
this video we'll look at a few factors that

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.730
influence the speed of chemical reactions.

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:26.039
This video is part of the Equilibrium video
series. It is often important to determine

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.680
whether or not a system is at equilibrium,
to do this we must understand how a system's

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.720
equilibrium state is constrained by its boundary
and surroundings.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:39.970
Hi, my name is George Zaidan and I'm a graduate
of the chemistry department here at MIT.

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:45.070
Before watching this video, you should have
a basic understanding of chemical equilibrium.

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.390
After watching this video, you will be able
to:

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.820
Understand how reaction rate is influenced
by reactant concentration

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.309
Explain how reaction rates change as a system
establishes equilibrium, AND

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:02.129
Predict relative equilibrium concentrations
of reactant and product, based on rates of

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:09.129
forward and reverse processes.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:16.880
Suppose you have this general reaction where
A, B, C, and D are molecules and lowercase

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:23.920
a, b, c, d are their molar coefficients.
As the reaction progresses, A and B will be

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:27.119
consumed, and C and D will be formed.

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.158
The speed at which any of these four processes
happen multiplied by the reciprocal of the

00:01:32.158 --> 00:01:37.158
appropriate molar coefficient is called the
rate of this reaction.

00:01:37.158 --> 00:01:42.149
If you want your car to go faster, you step
on the gas, but speeding up a chemical reaction

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:47.499
is not that simple. There are lots of different
factors that affect reaction rate. Three common

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:52.609
ones are: the concentration of reactants,
the temperature of the reaction mixture and

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:57.679
the presence of a catalyst. In this video
we'll focus on the effect of concentration

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:00.460
on homogenous reactions.

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.670
Most chemical reactions are the result of
two or more molecules colliding with each

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:10.330
other... but not every collision leads to
a reaction. The molecules must collide in

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:15.510
the proper physical orientation, and they
must do so with enough energy to break their

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.040
bonds.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:22.200
Imagine a beaker with 100 mL of water, in
which you dissolve 106 molecules of reactant

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:29.200
A and 106 molecules of reactant B. How likely
is the reaction to form C and D? Do a back

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:36.430
of the envelope calculation to support your
answer. Pause the video.

00:02:39.439 --> 00:02:46.439
So let's see. 100 mL of water is 100 grams
of water, which is 100 over 18.02, about 5.5

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:53.610
moles of water. That means there are about
3.3x1024 molecules of water in the beaker,

00:02:53.629 --> 00:03:00.629
and only 106 molecules of each reactant...So
in any given volume of this solution, 3.3x1024

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:08.450
over (3.3x1024 + 106 + 106), or 99.99999999999999994
%, of molecules are nonreactive water!

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:28.370
Clearly, successful collisions between the
reactants would be very rare in this situation.

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.980
Intuitively, you would expect that the more
concentrated the reactants, the faster the

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.680
reaction, and this is generally true.

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:42.680
Let's draw a reaction coordinate diagram to
better understand our hypothetical reaction.

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:52.390
Let's assume that the reaction is exothermic,
in other words, that energy is given off as

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:58.629
the reaction progresses, so we draw the curve
like this.

00:03:58.629 --> 00:03:59.189
The x-axis is the progress of the reaction,
and the y-axis is potential energy.

00:03:59.189 --> 00:03:59.560
Here are the reactants, and here are the products.

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:05.870
This hump is the activation energy, the point
of highest potential energy of the reaction.

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:11.319
Two molecules must collide with at least this
amount of energy in order to successfully

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:12.120
react.

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:17.798
Do you notice anything about this diagram?
There's no indication of directionality; in

00:04:17.798 --> 00:04:22.650
other words, there's no reason that the reaction
couldn't proceed backwards just as well as

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.260
forwards.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:28.290
You're probably used to thinking of chemical
reactions as processes that happen in only

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:35.060
one direction (forward), but most reactions
are actually reversible. There are a few exceptions,

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:42.060
for example combustion. *You can't un-burn
a match. But most reactions that chemists

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:47.350
carry out in the lab or that happen in our
bodies are reversible.

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:51.250
Draw your own reaction coordinate diagram
and label the forward and reverse reaction

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:56.650
paths. Suggest what the relationship might
be between the activation energy and the relative

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:03.650
rates of the forward and reverse reactions.
Pause the video.

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:11.720
This is the activation energy for the forward
reaction. The higher this activation energy,

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:16.160
the slower the forward reaction, because the
number of reactant molecules with sufficient

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:20.360
energy to react when they collide will decrease.

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:25.600
But now let's look at this picture in reverse.
The reverse activation energy is not the same

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:31.100
as the forward activation energy! In this
case, it's higher. So that means that the

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:35.140
reverse reaction will be slower than the forward
reaction.

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:40.700
If we were to somehow increase the activation
energy, both the forward and the reverse rates

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:46.500
would slow down, but the relationship between
them -- namely that the forward rate is faster

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:49.650
than the reverse rate -- would be preserved.

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:54.850
Here are four other diagrams, each for a different
hypothetical reaction. Predict the relative

00:05:54.850 --> 00:06:01.850
rates of the forward and reverse reactions
in each of these cases. Pause the video.

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:13.520
In

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:33.930
real life chemical processes, the rates of
the forward and reverse reactions are often

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:39.520
very different. Many of the reactions that
you may have previously thought of as "irreversible"actually

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:44.750
just have wildly different forward and reverse
rates. For example, you've probably seen the

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:48.720
dissociation of a strong acid in water written
like this.

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:55.180
But really, it's this. In this case, the forward
reaction is many orders of magnitude faster

00:06:55.180 --> 00:07:02.180
than the reverse reaction, so we write it
as just the forward reaction.

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:10.300
So far we've seen that concentration and activation
energy can each independently affect the rate

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:15.150
of a chemical reaction. The higher the concentration
of a reactant, the faster the reaction; and

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:20.490
the lower the activation energy, the faster
the reaction. But there's a twist... Thinking

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:27.490
about the hypothetical reaction A and B yields
C and D. Suggest what that twist might be.

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:36.810
Pause the video.

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:42.050
There's no reason that the activation energy
of this reaction would change as the reaction

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:49.050
progresses. But that's not true for the concentrations:
as A and B are converted to C and D, the concentration

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:56.300
of all four species change! And as the concentrations
change, the reaction rate also changes.

00:07:56.810 --> 00:08:01.710
To see if we can understand how the reaction
rate changes as the reaction progresses, let's

00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:06.930
go back to the reaction coordinate diagram.
Let's start by considering both the forward

00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:11.210
and reverse reactions as if they're completely
separate.

00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:18.210
Here are A and B reacting to form C and D.
Let's assume this forward reaction is relatively

00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:24.490
fast. As more and more A and B get converted
to products, their concentrations decrease,

00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:30.950
and the initially fast reaction rate slows
over time. Here are C and D reacting to form

00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:37.950
A and B. This reaction would be slower than
this one, but as C and D react, their concentrations

00:08:38.649 --> 00:08:43.099
decrease with time and the reaction becomes
even slower.

00:08:43.099 --> 00:08:50.099
Except that in reality, these aren't two separate
reactions. The products of one reaction are

00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:55.649
the reactants for the other.
Let's now consider the forward and reverse

00:08:55.649 --> 00:09:01.600
reactions at the same time. At the very very
beginning, only A and B are present -- no

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:06.680
C or D. So the initial rate of the forward
reaction will be relatively high, since the

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:12.740
concentrations of A and B are high. The reverse
reaction can't happen at all yet, because

00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:17.279
there is no C and D present, so its initial
rate is zero.

00:09:17.279 --> 00:09:23.629
As the reaction proceeds, two things happen:
the concentrations of A and B decrease, and

00:09:23.629 --> 00:09:29.920
the concentrations of C and D increase. So
the forward reaction rate slows, and the reverse

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:34.319
reaction rate speeds up.
Eventually, we reach a point where the rates

00:09:34.319 --> 00:09:39.839
of the forward and reverse reactions are the
same: this is the definition of a dynamic

00:09:39.839 --> 00:09:46.670
chemical equilibrium. When this happens, the
concentrations of A, B, C, and D stop changing

00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:53.670
with time. Be careful not to confuse equilibrium
with "no reaction."A and B are still reacting

00:09:54.500 --> 00:10:00.290
to form C and D; and C and D are still reacting
to form A and B. But the rate of formation

00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:05.100
of products equals the rate of disappearance
of reactants and vice versa. That means that

00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:10.310
the concentrations of A, B, C, and D don't
change with time.

00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:15.180
Let's go back to our reaction coordinate diagrams
for our four hypothetical reactions. We've

00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:20.459
already worked out the relative rates of the
forward and reverse reactions in each case.

00:10:20.459 --> 00:10:24.730
Using these relative rates, see if you can
predict the relative concentrations of the

00:10:24.730 --> 00:10:31.730
reactants and products at equilibrium. Pause
the video.

00:10:36.279 --> 00:10:43.220
-Endo, high Ea: lots of reactant, not much
product

00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:47.379
-Exo, high Ea: lots of product, not much reactant

00:10:47.379 --> 00:10:54.149
-(In both of these cases, the forward rate
is the same as the reverse rate...)Same energy,

00:10:54.149 --> 00:11:01.149
high Ea: ratio of product/reactant will depend
on specific reaction Same energy, low Ea:

00:11:08.569 --> 00:11:11.680
ratio of product/reactant will depend on specific
reaction

00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:16.819
Now what's the difference between the last
two scenarios? In each case, the forward reaction

00:11:16.819 --> 00:11:21.050
rate will be the same as the reverse reaction
rate. But the rates for this scenario will

00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:27.480
be much faster than for this one... so equilibrium
will be reached much more quickly here than

00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:31.180
here!
The most important thing to understand about

00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:35.769
reaction rates and equilibrium is that just
because the forward and reverse rates are

00:11:35.769 --> 00:11:42.629
the same DOES NOT mean that the concentrations
of the reactants and products are the same.

00:11:42.629 --> 00:11:47.129
Some equilibria, like the dissociation of
a strong acid in water, strongly favor the

00:11:47.129 --> 00:11:53.740
products. Others strongly favor the reactants.
Many of the reactions that keep us alive are

00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:57.449
equilibria, and our body goes to a great deal
of effort to make sure that the position of

00:11:57.449 --> 00:12:04.449
equilibrium heavily favors one side or the
other.

00:12:07.089 --> 00:12:10.749
We hope this video has helped you understand
the relationship between reaction rates and

00:12:10.749 --> 00:12:17.009
equilibrium. We saw that, in general, the
rate of a reaction decreases as reactant concentration

00:12:17.009 --> 00:12:18.040
decreases.

00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:23.079
And while we may think of reactions as irreversible,
most are actually reversible, it's just that

00:12:23.079 --> 00:12:25.620
we "see"the faster of the two.

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:30.899
As the forward reaction rate decreases, the
reverse reaction rate increases until equilibrium

00:12:30.899 --> 00:12:35.949
is established. At equilibrium, the rate of
the forward reaction equals the rate of the

00:12:35.949 --> 00:12:41.059
reverse reaction, but this does not imply
anything about the equilibrium concentrations

00:12:41.059 --> 00:12:44.399
of the products and reactants.

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:14.670
JONATHAN GRUBER: All
right, let's get started.

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.240
We have three weeks
left in the class.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.460
And what we'll be doing
for the next three weeks

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.640
is really a series
of applications

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.270
of what we've learned so far to
sort of help you understand how

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:28.610
we add some richness
to what we've learned

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:32.119
and sort of take it to some
more real world applications.

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:33.830
So we're going to
start that today

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:37.010
by talking about something we've
really ignored in the course

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:44.150
so far, which is uncertainty
and how uncertainty

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.730
affects your decision making.

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.210
So what we've done so
far in this class is

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:51.100
we've sort of said,
look, we've assumed

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.020
whenever you make
decisions you make them

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.390
with full knowledge
and full certainty.

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:58.000
But many, many
decisions in life are

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.450
made under conditions
of uncertainty.

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:02.890
So consider your
decision to study

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:05.379
for the final in this class.

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:09.310
In our models so far, you
could optimize your studying

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:10.820
across different
units of the class.

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.180
So our model so far,
you'd know on the final

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.700
which unit would be represented
with what proportion.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.680
You'd optimize your
studying appropriately.

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.450
But of course you
don't know that.

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.097
You face uncertainty
about what will

00:01:21.097 --> 00:01:22.930
be covered in the final
or upper proportion.

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:24.347
You know the whole
course-- you're

00:01:24.347 --> 00:01:25.798
responsible for the whole class.

00:01:25.798 --> 00:01:27.340
But obviously you
allocate your time.

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.110
You're uncertain
about how to allocate

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.660
your time across the different
subjects on the test.

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:34.480
So how do you make
that decision?

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.240
We need to bring
our tools to bear

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.910
on thinking about these
kinds of decision making

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:42.910
under uncertainty situations.

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:45.040
And this isn't just
about the test.

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.300
I decide whether to
bring my umbrella today.

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.240
If I bring my umbrella, there's
a chance I'm going to lose it.

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.340
But I don't want to get wet.

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.670
I have to think about
whether it's going to rain.

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.170
It all depends on
how certain I am

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:54.790
it's going to rain, et cetera.

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:59.785
There's decisions about whether
to bet on a sporting event.

00:01:59.785 --> 00:02:01.160
That's a decision
of uncertainty.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.010
And that's all the fun
stuff in your life.

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:05.067
When you get to the
anxiety ridden adult life,

00:02:05.067 --> 00:02:07.150
you've got things like
whether to buy a seven year

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.060
mortgage or a 30 year
mortgage, whether to buy

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.330
health insurance, what
school to put your kids in.

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.780
All these things involve a
huge amount of uncertainty.

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.600
And we have not yet developed
the tools to deal with this.

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.620
What's really cool
is that economics

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.180
has a very useful tool
to think about exactly

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:29.707
these kinds of situations.

00:02:29.707 --> 00:02:32.290
That much like the other tools
we've dealt with this semester,

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.330
it's pretty easy once
you understand it.

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.900
But it's a huge amount of
power for explaining the world.

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.990
And that's the tool of
expected utility theory.

00:02:46.178 --> 00:02:47.720
And that's what
we'll focus on today.

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.178
That's what we'll learn today,
the tool of expected utility

00:02:50.178 --> 00:02:51.758
theory.

00:02:51.758 --> 00:02:53.300
Now, I'm going to
ask you a question.

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.460
As always, I don't want
you try to outsmart me.

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:58.152
I just want a
quick, gut reaction.

00:02:58.152 --> 00:02:59.360
I'm going to offer you a bet.

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.115
Not really, but imagine I was.

00:03:01.115 --> 00:03:03.080
I'm going to flip a coin.

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.540
Heads you get $125.

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.070
Tails you give me $100.

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:09.730
So you win $125
versus lose $100.

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:10.980
How many of you take that bet?

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:14.715
So yeah.

00:03:14.715 --> 00:03:16.840
You're a slightly more
aggressive class than usual.

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.310
About 40% of you taking the bet.

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.800
Usually I get more
about 20%, 25%.

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:21.480
OK.

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.050
Now-- yeah.

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:24.177
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:03:24.177 --> 00:03:25.010
JONATHAN GRUBER: No.

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:27.310
It's a one time bet.

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.867
So basically-- now how
do we think about this,

00:03:30.867 --> 00:03:32.200
whether it's a good idea or not?

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.220
Now those who raised your hand
probably quickly did the math

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.880
and did in your head what
we call an expected value

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.300
calculation.

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:43.600
What's the expected
value of any gamble?

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.840
The expected value of any
gamble is the probability

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:53.470
that you win times what you win
plus the probability that you

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:57.070
lose times what you lose.

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:58.840
So you did that
calculation in your head.

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.750
You said, as long as he's not
cheating, using a fair coin,

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:11.460
there's a 0.5 times 125
plus 0.5 times minus 100.

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:17.885
And that is an expected
value of $12.50.

00:04:17.885 --> 00:04:19.760
So those of you who
raised your hand probably

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.700
did that calculation
quickly in your head

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:24.880
and said, yeah, this is a
positive expected value.

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:31.440
This is what we call in
economics a more than fair bet.

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:32.670
More than fair.

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:36.970
A fair bet is one with
an expected value of 0.

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:39.910
So a fair bet is one with
an expected value of 0.

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:41.830
So a bet with a
positive expected value

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:43.793
is more than fair.

00:04:43.793 --> 00:04:45.710
And you in your head
said, I did that through.

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:48.950
It's more than fair.

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:50.960
And that's why some of
you raised your hands.

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.840
But many of you didn't.

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:54.860
And that doesn't
mean you were wrong.

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:58.550
It just means this is not the
right way to think about it.

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:01.040
The right way to think about
it is that what you care about

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.480
is not dollars.

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.870
What you care about is utility.

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:06.470
Dollars are meaningless.

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:10.790
What you care about as a
consumer is your utility.

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:13.610
And so we don't want to
think about expected value.

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:16.850
We want to think about
expected utility.

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:18.320
Now, what is expected utility?

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:22.480
It's the same kind of formula
as this but with one change.

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:25.510
Expected utility
is the probability

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:32.240
that you win times your utility
if you win plus the probability

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:36.780
that you lose times your
utility if you lose.

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:43.040
And that is somewhat
different than expected value.

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:46.120
And the reason is
because utility is not

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.290
a linear weighting of dollars.

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:53.330
Utility is a concave
weighting of dollars.

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:56.870
As such, because you utility is
a concave weighting of dollars,

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:01.220
it exhibits diminishing
marginal utility.

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:03.830
Diminishing marginal
rate of substitution.

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:05.720
Diminishing marginal
rate of substitution,

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:08.240
as we talked about ad
nauseam in consumer theory.

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:15.700
That means that the next
dollar is worth less to you

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:16.930
than the previous dollar.

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:21.677
The next dollars worth
diminishing utility.

00:06:21.677 --> 00:06:23.510
The next slice of pizza
is worth less to you

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:24.930
than the previous
slice of pizza.

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:27.060
Likewise, the next
dollar's worth less to you

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:28.950
than the previous dollar.

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:33.270
As a result, losing
$1 makes you sadder

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:35.790
than winning $1 makes you happy.

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:38.190
There's a nonlinearity
that comes

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:39.810
from diminishing
marginal utility

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:42.510
and diminishing marginal
rate of substitution.

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:45.240
So for example, let's think
about our typical utility

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:47.850
function that we use
previously in consumer theory.

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:50.302
Utility equals the square
root of consumption.

00:06:50.302 --> 00:06:52.260
And let's just say you
consume all your income,

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:53.100
as we always did.

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:55.200
We've talked about savings
the last couple of lectures.

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:57.120
Let's put savings aside
again and just assume

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:59.510
people consume all their income.

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:03.030
And so you utility is the
square root of consumption.

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:08.760
And let's say you start your
initial consumption, c0 is 100.

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:13.670
You start with $100
of consumption.

00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:15.270
Your c0 is 100.

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:18.890
So your initial
utility u0 is 10.

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:23.430
Now, I give you--

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:25.020
I offer you this bet.

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:27.270
What's the expected
utility of this bet?

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:29.370
Well, the expected
utility of this bet

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:34.960
is the probability you win,
0.5, times utility if you win,

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:38.040
where utility if you win is the
square root of your consumption

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:39.370
if you win.

00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:43.190
What is your
consumption if you win?

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:46.025
If you win the bet, what
is your consumption?

00:07:46.025 --> 00:07:48.950
Somebody raise your
hand and tell me.

00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:51.540
Starting with 100 and
I made this bet with.

00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:52.150
Yeah.

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:52.733
AUDIENCE: 225.

00:07:52.733 --> 00:07:54.060
JONATHAN GRUBER: 225.

00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:56.880
You started with
100 and you won 125.

00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:00.520
If you lose the bet,
what do you have?

00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:07.400
What do you have if
you lose the bet?

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:08.540
0.

00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:09.710
OK?

00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:12.650
So your expected
utility is 0.5 times

00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:14.600
this utility of
what you get if you

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:19.700
win plus 0.5 times
utility what if you lose.

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:26.920
Now if you do that math, you
will find that that is 7.5.

00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:28.570
Your expected
utility of this bet

00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:34.429
is 7.5, which is less
than your initial utility.

00:08:34.429 --> 00:08:39.014
So you should not take the bet,
which is through the mechanism

00:08:39.014 --> 00:08:43.010
of psychology why
many of you didn't.

00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:45.650
You should not take the bet.

00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:51.020
And the reason is because
you are what we call risk--

00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:53.570
and humans are what
we call risk averse.

00:08:57.570 --> 00:09:02.660
That risk is inherently
negative value to us.

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:05.610
A certain dollar is
worth much more to us

00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:07.440
than an uncertain dollar.

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:10.440
Just like $1 today is worth
more than $1 tomorrow,

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:14.190
a certain dollar is worth much
more than an uncertain dollar.

00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:17.850
To see why, the best way-- this
intuition here is graphical.

00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:20.910
So let's go to figure 20-1
and just sort of slowly

00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:21.690
walk through this.

00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:23.700
It's a little confusing graph.

00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:26.960
On the x-axis is your wealth,
your total consumption or money

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:27.460
you have.

00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:28.850
You consume everything you have.

00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:31.650
So it's wealth, or
alternatively consumption.

00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:35.640
On the y-axis of figure
20-1 is your utility.

00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:39.080
It's the graph of how much
you consume against utility.

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:43.160
And as you can see,
this is a concave graph.

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:47.660
It's exhibiting diminishing
marginal utility.

00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:52.400
Each dollar of wealth adds
utility but less and less

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:53.510
over time.

00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:55.730
Just like a slice of
pizza makes you happier

00:09:55.730 --> 00:09:59.040
but less and less over time.

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:00.000
You get that.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.958
So the shape of this curve is
true for any utility function

00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:06.750
that features diminishing
marginal utility.

00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:08.292
That pretty much
any utility function

00:10:08.292 --> 00:10:09.580
we haven't used this semester.

00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:11.700
It's not as if we're
trying to trick you.

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:13.800
Has diminishing
marginal utility.

00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:17.550
So as a result,
it has this shape.

00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:21.560
Now, with the utility
function of this shape,

00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:25.820
let's evaluate the
gamble I just gave you.

00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:29.610
You start with wealth of 100.

00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:32.920
So you see on the x-axis
the 100 point, that

00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:36.880
corresponds to utility of 10.

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:40.600
So you can trace up that
100 to utility curve,

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:42.790
and then you go
over to the y-axis.

00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:45.590
So that corresponds
to a utility of 10.

00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:49.180
Now, think about
what the gamble does.

00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:51.070
What the gamble
does is say look.

00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:54.160
There's two possible outcomes
with 50% chance each.

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:57.100
One is wealth of 225.

00:10:57.100 --> 00:10:59.560
That is the point all
the way to the right.

00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:02.560
That leaves utility of 15.

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:04.660
The other's wealth of 0.

00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:06.970
That's the point all
the way to the left.

00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:10.080
That was utility of 0.

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:11.580
What is the average
of those two?

00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:13.680
Well, it's just a
linear combination.

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:15.720
So 50% chance of each.

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:21.770
So the average of those
two is a wealth of 112.5

00:11:21.770 --> 00:11:24.960
but an expected utility of 7.5.

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:29.210
So you draw a cord between those
two points, between the 0 point

00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:32.810
and point B. You find the
midpoint of that cord.

00:11:32.810 --> 00:11:34.550
That's wealth of 112.5.

00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:37.970
But then you trace that
over to utility function.

00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:43.620
And you see the expected
utility is only 7.5.

00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:47.610
And that's because we're not
using a linear combination.

00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:49.710
We're using a
nonlinear combination--

00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:51.930
a nonlinear concave
combination--

00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:54.960
which means that moving
up in terms of wealth

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:57.720
makes you less happy than
moving down in terms of wealth

00:11:57.720 --> 00:11:58.740
makes you sad.

00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:01.220
And you're really sad at 0.

00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:03.590
So going for 100
down to 0 makes you

00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:08.683
way sadder than going from 100
up to 225 makes you happier.

00:12:08.683 --> 00:12:10.100
And that's all
because diminishing

00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:12.500
marginal utility of income.

00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:16.720
So it's natural that this gamble
would make you worse off, even

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:19.950
though it's more than
fair, because, yeah, you're

00:12:19.950 --> 00:12:21.300
somewhat happier if you win.

00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:24.540
If you win, utility
goes up from 10 to 15.

00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:26.000
That's great.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.340
But if you lose, utility
goes down from 10 to 0.

00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:30.090
That's really bad.

00:12:30.090 --> 00:12:33.760
So you don't want to
take this risk, which

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:37.240
is why, although you may
not realize it, many of you

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:39.880
wouldn't want to
take that gamble.

00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:41.590
So using this
graphic, let's ask--

00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:43.940
are there questions about that?

00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:44.629
Yeah.

00:12:44.629 --> 00:12:46.046
AUDIENCE: So would
we take the bet

00:12:46.046 --> 00:12:48.541
if our gain utility
outweighs our loss utility,

00:12:48.541 --> 00:12:51.970
or we would not take the bet
if our utility [INAUDIBLE]..

00:12:51.970 --> 00:12:54.820
JONATHAN GRUBER: Well,
you've answered--

00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:56.998
it's the same-- those two
questions are the same.

00:12:56.998 --> 00:12:58.540
It just depends on
the probabilities.

00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:00.347
If the probabilities
are 0.5 each,

00:13:00.347 --> 00:13:01.930
then those two
answers-- two questions

00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:04.060
are exactly the same
because 0.5 each

00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:07.840
would be gain outweighing losses
the same as on net positive.

00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:09.340
But if the probabilities
aren't 0.5,

00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:11.055
you want to use this equation.

00:13:11.055 --> 00:13:13.180
So you basically want to
say is the weighted-- it's

00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:15.055
about the weighted
average change in utility,

00:13:15.055 --> 00:13:19.170
essentially, where the weights
are these probabilities.

00:13:19.170 --> 00:13:19.760
Yeah.

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:21.510
AUDIENCE: Is there any
utility calculation

00:13:21.510 --> 00:13:22.480
in actually gambling.

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:24.430
Like can someone
dislike gambling--

00:13:24.430 --> 00:13:24.700
JONATHAN GRUBER: Hold on.

00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:25.810
I'm going to come to that.

00:13:25.810 --> 00:13:27.227
We're going come
back to gambling.

00:13:27.227 --> 00:13:29.990
We talk all about the
lottery at the end.

00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:30.490
OK.

00:13:30.490 --> 00:13:34.170
But do people understand
the basics of this graph?

00:13:34.170 --> 00:13:38.110
So using this graph,
tell me the following.

00:13:38.110 --> 00:13:43.125
How much-- answer the
following question.

00:13:48.530 --> 00:13:50.915
How much-- let's say--

00:13:50.915 --> 00:13:51.790
it's a hard question.

00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:53.010
See if you can get this.

00:13:53.010 --> 00:13:54.920
Let's say that I said,
you know what, class,

00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:56.753
I'm going to force you
to take this gamble.

00:13:56.753 --> 00:13:58.170
I'm going to come
in here, and I'm

00:13:58.170 --> 00:13:59.930
going to tell you
I'm locking the door.

00:13:59.930 --> 00:14:04.160
You're not leaving without
taking this gamble unless you

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:07.350
pay me not to force you.

00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:10.900
So I'm going to offer
you a more than fair bet.

00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:14.050
Would you be willing to pay
me to get out of that bet?

00:14:14.050 --> 00:14:16.330
And how much would you
be willing to pay me?

00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:16.830
Yeah.

00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:21.410
AUDIENCE: I'd be willing to pay
you up to 2 and 1/2 dollars.

00:14:21.410 --> 00:14:23.144
JONATHAN GRUBER: Up
to 2 and 1/2 dollars.

00:14:23.144 --> 00:14:26.442
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:26.442 --> 00:14:27.900
JONATHAN GRUBER:
2 and 1/2 dollars.

00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:28.692
I don't understand.

00:14:28.692 --> 00:14:31.260
AUDIENCE: Sorry, [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:32.760
JONATHAN GRUBER:
Well, OK, that's--

00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:33.927
AUDIENCE: $100 start, right?

00:14:33.927 --> 00:14:35.354
JONATHAN GRUBER:
Yeah. $100 start.

00:14:35.354 --> 00:14:36.067
AUDIENCE: $25.

00:14:36.067 --> 00:14:36.900
JONATHAN GRUBER: OK.

00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:38.923
You're thinking about
that sort of right,

00:14:38.923 --> 00:14:41.340
but you're still thinking in
a linear world, not nonlinear

00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:41.850
world.

00:14:41.850 --> 00:14:42.680
Look at the graph.

00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:43.180
OK.

00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:43.980
Yeah.

00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:46.075
AUDIENCE: Would it be $43.75?

00:14:46.075 --> 00:14:48.060
JONATHAN GRUBER: It
would be exactly $43.75.

00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:48.960
Why?

00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:51.930
AUDIENCE: Because right
now the bet essentially

00:14:51.930 --> 00:14:54.807
gives me the utility of $56.25.

00:14:54.807 --> 00:14:56.640
JONATHAN GRUBER: So
your answer in the front

00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:58.800
was exactly right
in a linear world.

00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:00.550
But in a nonlinear
world, you've got

00:15:00.550 --> 00:15:02.320
to account for the curvature.

00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:05.010
So the way to think about
it is right now your utility

00:15:05.010 --> 00:15:07.440
from that bet, if I
force you to take it,

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:11.550
it leaves you a
utility of $56.25.

00:15:11.550 --> 00:15:12.420
You can see that.

00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:15.240
Just go backwards from
the 7.5 utility down

00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:17.610
to what level of wealth
that's equivalent.

00:15:17.610 --> 00:15:25.590
What that means is you would
rather pay me $43.74 than take

00:15:25.590 --> 00:15:26.540
that bet.

00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:28.650
Think about how crazy
that is for one second.

00:15:28.650 --> 00:15:33.590
I'm offering you a bet
that is more than fair,

00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:37.530
and you will pay me almost
half of your entire wealth

00:15:37.530 --> 00:15:39.787
to avoid taking that bet.

00:15:39.787 --> 00:15:41.870
And that's only with our
standard utility function

00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:43.960
we always use.

00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:45.250
That's risk aversion.

00:15:45.250 --> 00:15:49.720
And the reason is
because 0 sucks so badly.

00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:52.780
The reason is because
you're so sad going to 0

00:15:52.780 --> 00:15:55.990
that you really don't want
to be in that situation.

00:15:55.990 --> 00:15:59.890
And so you will
actually pay me $43.75

00:15:59.890 --> 00:16:02.410
to avoid a more than fair bet.

00:16:02.410 --> 00:16:05.380
That's what's crazy.

00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:06.970
So another way to see this--

00:16:06.970 --> 00:16:09.090
let me ask you another question.

00:16:09.090 --> 00:16:12.120
How large-- let's
offer you the same bet.

00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:13.910
Flip a coin.

00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:15.500
Tails, you lose 100.

00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:17.690
Heads, you win x.

00:16:17.690 --> 00:16:22.420
How large would x have to
be for you to take the bet?

00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:24.010
Tails, you lose 100.

00:16:24.010 --> 00:16:25.230
Heads, you win x.

00:16:25.230 --> 00:16:25.730
Yeah.

00:16:25.730 --> 00:16:26.355
AUDIENCE: $300.

00:16:26.355 --> 00:16:27.272
JONATHAN GRUBER: $300.

00:16:27.272 --> 00:16:27.850
Why?

00:16:27.850 --> 00:16:30.160
AUDIENCE: Because then your
expected utility is 10.

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:30.430
JONATHAN GRUBER: Right.

00:16:30.430 --> 00:16:31.210
Exactly.

00:16:31.210 --> 00:16:33.920
If it's $300, then I'm
doing the square root

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:37.192
of 400, which is 20, and
the square root of 0.

00:16:37.192 --> 00:16:38.650
You average those,
and you're going

00:16:38.650 --> 00:16:41.350
to get expected utility of 10.

00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:44.290
So for you to take that
bet, I would have to say,

00:16:44.290 --> 00:16:47.620
tails, you lose 100,
heads, you win 300.

00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:51.180
I need to give you a
monstrously more than fair bet.

00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:56.070
And that is due to the
principle of risk aversion.

00:16:56.070 --> 00:16:58.445
That basically, because of
diminishing marginal utility--

00:16:58.445 --> 00:17:00.028
risk aversion isn't
something made up.

00:17:00.028 --> 00:17:01.380
It's not some crazy concept.

00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:05.010
It just falls naturally out
of diminishing margin utility

00:17:05.010 --> 00:17:09.869
because making you sad, because
losing, because moving down

00:17:09.869 --> 00:17:13.589
makes you sadder than
moving up makes you happier.

00:17:13.589 --> 00:17:14.640
Any questions about that?

00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:16.109
Yeah.

00:17:16.109 --> 00:17:17.849
AUDIENCE: I guess
the question is,

00:17:17.849 --> 00:17:19.724
doesn't this kind of
more depende on utility?

00:17:19.724 --> 00:17:20.730
Because I know that--

00:17:20.730 --> 00:17:21.000
JONATHAN GRUBER: OK.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:21.579
Stop there.

00:17:21.579 --> 00:17:22.787
Let's go to the next section.

00:17:22.787 --> 00:17:24.420
You guys are way
ahead of me as always.

00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:26.265
Let's talk about a
couple extensions.

00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:33.310
Let's talk about a
couple extensions.

00:17:33.310 --> 00:17:37.600
First extension, change
utility function.

00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:40.930
Suppose your utility
function was of the form u

00:17:40.930 --> 00:17:44.652
equals 0.1 times c.

00:17:44.652 --> 00:17:46.110
Now I've chose this
particular form

00:17:46.110 --> 00:17:48.120
because the initial
conditions are the same.

00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:52.170
With c0 of 100, u0 is still 10.

00:17:52.170 --> 00:17:56.160
So I'm starting from the
same point as I was before.

00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:59.220
But now, would you
take the bet, and why?

00:18:02.290 --> 00:18:07.520
If that's utility function,
would you take the bet and why?

00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:09.930
Just do the math.

00:18:09.930 --> 00:18:10.980
Do the math.

00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:13.080
What's your expected
utility of that bet?

00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:18.780
Your expected utility is 0.5
times your utility of 225.

00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:28.110
So it's times 0.1 times 225 plus
0.5 times your utility of 0.

00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:30.090
So it's 0.1 times 0.

00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:35.540
And if you write that
out and solve it,

00:18:35.540 --> 00:18:40.860
you get 11.25, which
is greater than 10.

00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:43.880
So you would take the bet.

00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:46.180
Any questions about the math?

00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:49.000
I just did the expected
utility evaluation.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:50.860
So you would take the bet.

00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:52.130
What's the difference?

00:18:52.130 --> 00:18:55.020
Why do you take the bet here?

00:18:55.020 --> 00:18:55.670
Yeah.

00:18:55.670 --> 00:18:56.170
Yeah.

00:18:56.170 --> 00:18:57.280
Let me get-- go ahead.

00:18:57.280 --> 00:18:59.460
AUDIENCE: This is a
linear utility function.

00:18:59.460 --> 00:18:59.992
So--

00:18:59.992 --> 00:19:02.200
JONATHAN GRUBER: If you're
a linear utility function,

00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:05.300
what you care about
is expected value.

00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:06.970
So you can see that--

00:19:06.970 --> 00:19:08.440
do I have that, yeah--

00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:10.540
in figure 22.

00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:14.530
This is the case we
call risk neutrality.

00:19:14.530 --> 00:19:16.510
With the linear
utility function,

00:19:16.510 --> 00:19:19.930
you're risk neutral
because your linear utility

00:19:19.930 --> 00:19:23.630
function does not have what?

00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:26.120
Does not have diminishing
margin utility.

00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:30.493
As a result, you just
care about expected value.

00:19:30.493 --> 00:19:32.660
There's no difference in
expected value and expected

00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:33.805
utility.

00:19:33.805 --> 00:19:35.180
Now, the numbers
are a little bit

00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:36.680
different because
the functional form,

00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:37.930
but it gives the same outcome.

00:19:37.930 --> 00:19:39.890
You always take a
more than fair bet

00:19:39.890 --> 00:19:41.930
and you reject a
less than fair bet.

00:19:41.930 --> 00:19:47.240
So as people move from risk
averse to risk neutral,

00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:49.130
or as utility
features less and less

00:19:49.130 --> 00:19:50.870
diminishing margin
utility, they'll

00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:53.713
be more and more
willing to take gambles.

00:19:53.713 --> 00:19:55.130
But it doesn't
have to stop there.

00:19:55.130 --> 00:19:56.450
We can go further.

00:19:56.450 --> 00:20:02.130
Imagine that I wrote
utility of the form--

00:20:02.130 --> 00:20:07.000
utility was of the form
c squared over 1,000.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.810
A weird utility function
but once again created

00:20:09.810 --> 00:20:16.430
so that if c0 equals
100, u0 equals 10.

00:20:16.430 --> 00:20:19.120
Now let's do the expected
value calculation.

00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:21.340
Well, if you take
the gamble, there's

00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:24.770
a 0.5 probability that you win.

00:20:24.770 --> 00:20:25.900
So then you would have--

00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:33.820
utility B would be 225
squared over 1,000 and a 0.5

00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:35.530
probability that you lose.

00:20:35.530 --> 00:20:38.600
So you just get 0.

00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:43.020
And the expected utility
in that case is 25.3.

00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:45.210
The expected
utility equals 25.3,

00:20:45.210 --> 00:20:48.410
which is way bigger than 10.

00:20:48.410 --> 00:20:50.020
So you take this gamble.

00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:50.830
Why?

00:20:50.830 --> 00:20:52.705
Because now you're risk loving.

00:20:52.705 --> 00:20:55.080
Because what does this say
about the diminishing marginal

00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:58.025
utility of income?

00:20:58.025 --> 00:20:59.900
This actually says you
have increasing margin

00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:01.700
utility of consumption.

00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:04.310
A utility function like this
says the next slice of pizza

00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:06.740
makes you even happier than
the previous slice of pizza.

00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:08.990
So go figure 22-3.

00:21:08.990 --> 00:21:12.810
This is the risk loving
case, where you actually

00:21:12.810 --> 00:21:15.380
have increasing marginal
utility of consumption.

00:21:15.380 --> 00:21:16.880
We don't really
talk about this case

00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:18.500
because it doesn't make sense.

00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:22.040
But just to understand
how this works,

00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:27.010
same calculations before
you start at a point like A.

00:21:27.010 --> 00:21:31.030
If you win, you go to B.
If you lose, you go to 0.

00:21:31.030 --> 00:21:33.940
Well, this shape utility
function, going to B

00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:37.600
makes you way happier than
going to 0 makes you sad.

00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:40.740
So you love the gamble.

00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:43.110
In fact, with this
utility function,

00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:44.690
you would take an unfair bet.

00:21:47.550 --> 00:21:50.445
So for example, imagine I
change the gamble to one

00:21:50.445 --> 00:21:52.620
where it's win 100, lose--

00:21:52.620 --> 00:21:56.253
I'm sorry, win 75, lose 100.

00:21:56.253 --> 00:21:57.420
So I changed the gamble now.

00:21:57.420 --> 00:21:58.590
Win 75, lose 100.

00:21:58.590 --> 00:22:00.240
I made an unfair bet.

00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:03.340
The expected value was negative.

00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:06.270
Well, this person will
still take that bet.

00:22:06.270 --> 00:22:11.790
If you do the math, if
they win, 75, they get 175.

00:22:11.790 --> 00:22:15.120
Just replace this with 175.

00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:17.450
And you do the math.

00:22:17.450 --> 00:22:21.480
You're going to find that the
expected utility in that case

00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:28.470
is 15.3, which is
greater than 10.

00:22:28.470 --> 00:22:30.830
So even an unfair bet--

00:22:30.830 --> 00:22:33.070
lose 100, win 75--

00:22:33.070 --> 00:22:36.260
will still leave these risk
loving people better off than

00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:38.489
if they hadn't taken a bet.

00:22:38.489 --> 00:22:39.375
Yeah.

00:22:39.375 --> 00:22:42.083
AUDIENCE: So when we're
doing the losses, when

00:22:42.083 --> 00:22:44.500
we set that to 0, we're assuming
that they're starting off

00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:46.982
with the amount that they
could possibly lose, correct?

00:22:46.982 --> 00:22:48.190
JONATHAN GRUBER: Oh, that's--

00:22:48.190 --> 00:22:48.560
OK.

00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:48.830
Great.

00:22:48.830 --> 00:22:49.970
I'm going to come to that next.

00:22:49.970 --> 00:22:51.060
That's in these examples.

00:22:51.060 --> 00:22:53.018
But you've called me on
an important assumption

00:22:53.018 --> 00:22:54.170
I'm making.

00:22:54.170 --> 00:22:55.250
These examples I have.

00:22:55.250 --> 00:22:57.708
Let's make sure we understand
risk neutral and risk loving.

00:22:57.708 --> 00:22:59.950
People understand that?

00:22:59.950 --> 00:23:05.437
So now let's-- now you
actually raised another issue.

00:23:05.437 --> 00:23:06.520
Let me ask a new question.

00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:09.000
Once again, forget
everything you've learned.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:09.927
Gut instincts.

00:23:09.927 --> 00:23:11.260
Here's the bet I'm offering you.

00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:12.610
Flip a coin.

00:23:12.610 --> 00:23:14.980
Heads, you win 1,250.

00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:16.160
Tails, you lose $10.

00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:18.330
Who takes that bet?

00:23:18.330 --> 00:23:21.020
Raise your hands if
you take that bet.

00:23:21.020 --> 00:23:21.520
OK.

00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:22.570
That's backwards.

00:23:22.570 --> 00:23:25.870
More of you should take
that bet, not less of you.

00:23:25.870 --> 00:23:26.905
And why is that?

00:23:26.905 --> 00:23:30.060
It's because of exactly
what you just pointed out.

00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:34.340
It's because basically
if you think about that--

00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:35.470
think about that bet.

00:23:35.470 --> 00:23:38.340
Think about-- let's go back
to our old utility function,

00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:41.500
u equals square root of c.

00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:43.270
Let's think about that bet.

00:23:43.270 --> 00:23:45.790
So what's the expected utility?

00:23:45.790 --> 00:23:49.960
It's 0.5 times you win 1,250.

00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:56.540
So it's square root of
112.5 plus 0.5 times

00:23:56.540 --> 00:24:00.010
you lose 10 square root of 90.

00:24:00.010 --> 00:24:07.860
And that expected utility is
10.5, which is greater than 10.

00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:10.620
So you should take that bet.

00:24:10.620 --> 00:24:11.970
What changed?

00:24:11.970 --> 00:24:13.530
You're still risk averse.

00:24:13.530 --> 00:24:17.310
The guy who would've paid me
$44 to avoid the other bet

00:24:17.310 --> 00:24:19.530
is now happy to take this bet.

00:24:19.530 --> 00:24:20.880
Same person.

00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:23.398
What changed?

00:24:23.398 --> 00:24:23.940
What changed?

00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:24.200
Yeah.

00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:26.180
AUDIENCE: Smaller
portion of [INAUDIBLE]..

00:24:26.180 --> 00:24:26.570
JONATHAN GRUBER: Right.

00:24:26.570 --> 00:24:28.670
And why does a smaller
portion of the income

00:24:28.670 --> 00:24:30.042
change things here?

00:24:30.042 --> 00:24:32.338
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:32.338 --> 00:24:33.380
JONATHAN GRUBER: Exactly.

00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:35.990
Because ultimately,
infinitesimally, it's

00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:37.130
a linear curve.

00:24:37.130 --> 00:24:42.920
So if you go back to Figure 21,
for any given epsilon change

00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:46.200
from point A it's linear.

00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:50.030
So essentially as gambles get
smaller and smaller relative

00:24:50.030 --> 00:24:52.750
to your starting point, you
become more and more risk

00:24:52.750 --> 00:24:53.250
neutral.

00:24:56.350 --> 00:24:58.940
Because, yeah, you're a
bit sadder than happier

00:24:58.940 --> 00:25:00.377
but just a bit.

00:25:00.377 --> 00:25:01.460
And remember, it's linear.

00:25:01.460 --> 00:25:07.040
You just take-- so if I did
12 and 1/2 cents versus $0.10,

00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:08.840
then unless you were
crazy risk averse,

00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:11.990
you should take that bet because
essentially you only care--

00:25:11.990 --> 00:25:14.240
at that point it's so tiny
relative to your wealth you

00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:17.750
might as well use
expected value.

00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:21.660
So as gambles become smaller
relative to your income,

00:25:21.660 --> 00:25:26.200
the utility function
becomes locally flatter.

00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:28.780
Utility function
goes locally flatter.

00:25:28.780 --> 00:25:31.780
And as a result, you become
more and more risk neutral.

00:25:35.550 --> 00:25:37.720
Question about that?

00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:38.890
Last point.

00:25:38.890 --> 00:25:42.740
Why did so many of you
still not take that bet?

00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:46.250
Well, the answer is that even
the model we've talked so far

00:25:46.250 --> 00:25:48.727
misses an important
psychological phenomena.

00:25:48.727 --> 00:25:50.810
So now I'm stepping out
of standard microeconomics

00:25:50.810 --> 00:25:52.435
into the realm of
behavioral economics.

00:25:52.435 --> 00:25:54.200
Unfortunately, due to
time this semester,

00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:55.100
I'm not going to
get to my lecture

00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:56.430
on behavioral economics.

00:25:56.430 --> 00:25:57.110
But you guys want to learn--

00:25:57.110 --> 00:25:58.580
I'll talk a little bit about
it in the next few lectures.

00:25:58.580 --> 00:25:59.840
I'll sprinkle it in.

00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:01.940
But course 1113 is
a fascinating course

00:26:01.940 --> 00:26:03.918
we offer here about how
you build psychology

00:26:03.918 --> 00:26:05.210
when you think about economics.

00:26:05.210 --> 00:26:06.830
And here's one example.

00:26:06.830 --> 00:26:09.350
Why is it that even
with this gamble,

00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:11.840
even if I'd done the 12
and 1/2, $0.10 gamble,

00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:13.940
a bunch of you still
wouldn't have taken it.

00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:14.970
Why is that?

00:26:14.970 --> 00:26:18.380
That's because humans not only
feature risk aversion, humans

00:26:18.380 --> 00:26:23.450
also feature loss
aversion, which

00:26:23.450 --> 00:26:26.750
is we have an irrational
behavioral bias

00:26:26.750 --> 00:26:32.580
that losing by itself makes
us sad relative to winning.

00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:35.550
Taking away something
we have makes us sadder

00:26:35.550 --> 00:26:37.710
than getting something new.

00:26:37.710 --> 00:26:39.510
So here's a standard
experiment that's run.

00:26:42.660 --> 00:26:45.150
They get a bunch of $5 mugs.

00:26:45.150 --> 00:26:47.040
Mugs worth about $5.

00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:48.030
They take people.

00:26:48.030 --> 00:26:52.320
And randomly half of the people
they ask, how much would you

00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:54.300
pay for this mug?

00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:56.460
And half the people
they give them the mug

00:26:56.460 --> 00:26:59.490
and say, how much would
you sell your mug for?

00:26:59.490 --> 00:27:01.590
Half people they
say, here's a mug,

00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:02.873
how much would you pay for it?

00:27:02.873 --> 00:27:04.290
Half the people
say, here's a mug.

00:27:04.290 --> 00:27:04.827
It's yours.

00:27:04.827 --> 00:27:05.910
But I want to buy it back.

00:27:05.910 --> 00:27:08.060
How much would you
sell it to me for?

00:27:08.060 --> 00:27:12.350
The average person will pay
$3, but the average person

00:27:12.350 --> 00:27:14.900
wants $7 to sell it back.

00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:16.640
That makes no sense.

00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:18.673
Either way, it's trivial.

00:27:18.673 --> 00:27:19.340
It's just a mug.

00:27:19.340 --> 00:27:21.423
It's trivial relative
to your wealth.

00:27:21.423 --> 00:27:22.090
It's just a mug.

00:27:22.090 --> 00:27:23.530
It doesn't really matter.

00:27:23.530 --> 00:27:26.307
But once people have
it, they feel like, no,

00:27:26.307 --> 00:27:27.140
that's already mine.

00:27:27.140 --> 00:27:28.390
I don't want to sell it.

00:27:28.390 --> 00:27:30.670
That's loss aversion.

00:27:30.670 --> 00:27:35.360
People are biased by
their starting points.

00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:38.470
Your very starting point
dictates your willingness

00:27:38.470 --> 00:27:41.680
to take a gamble,
which is not true

00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:43.390
in a standard economic model.

00:27:43.390 --> 00:27:48.540
But it's true in all laboratory
experiments in psychology.

00:27:48.540 --> 00:27:52.790
So the reason people don't
like gambles are not only

00:27:52.790 --> 00:27:54.360
because they're risk averse.

00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:56.180
But even more,
they're loss averse.

00:27:56.180 --> 00:27:58.880
So for example, there's
great economic studies

00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:04.810
which show that there's a
massive bias against selling

00:28:04.810 --> 00:28:08.180
your house for anything under
the price you paid for it.

00:28:08.180 --> 00:28:09.250
That people sort of--

00:28:09.250 --> 00:28:10.520
they're very sort of
linear, and they're

00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:12.220
willing to sell the house above
the price you paid for it.

00:28:12.220 --> 00:28:14.140
But there's this huge notch
at the price you paid for it.

00:28:14.140 --> 00:28:16.550
They simply don't want to
sell less they paid for it.

00:28:16.550 --> 00:28:18.460
And that's just
loss aversion idea.

00:28:18.460 --> 00:28:20.950
This comes up in
many other contexts.

00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:23.577
So there's two reasons why
people are risk averse,

00:28:23.577 --> 00:28:25.660
that people won't take
gambles-- a standard reason

00:28:25.660 --> 00:28:29.290
and the sort of extra
psychological bias.

00:28:29.290 --> 00:28:33.650
Now, this raises-- this leads
us naturally to the next section

00:28:33.650 --> 00:28:35.320
I want to go to,
which is to talk

00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:41.920
about applications of this
theory and why it's important.

00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:47.190
And the first application I
want to talk about is insurance.

00:28:47.190 --> 00:28:50.710
Insurance is big
business in America.

00:28:50.710 --> 00:28:54.260
Individuals in America
pay individuals--

00:28:54.260 --> 00:28:56.610
forgetting the
government, just people--

00:28:56.610 --> 00:29:01.320
spend $1.5 trillion a year
on insurance products.

00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:03.265
Almost 10% of GDP.

00:29:03.265 --> 00:29:07.140
10% of our entire economy
is people buying insurance.

00:29:07.140 --> 00:29:10.050
Health insurance is the
biggest, life insurance,

00:29:10.050 --> 00:29:14.010
casualty and property insurance,
auto insurance, et cetera.

00:29:14.010 --> 00:29:18.270
Added all up, it's almost a
tenth of our entire economy.

00:29:18.270 --> 00:29:19.780
Why?

00:29:19.780 --> 00:29:22.058
Because they're risk averse,
and also loss averse.

00:29:22.058 --> 00:29:24.100
I'm going to put loss
aversion aside and just use

00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:25.120
the standard framework.

00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:27.040
That just strengthens
the argument.

00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:29.710
But it's because
they're risk averse.

00:29:29.710 --> 00:29:32.530
So let's do the math.

00:29:32.530 --> 00:29:35.505
Imagine you're a single
25-year-old male.

00:29:35.505 --> 00:29:36.880
I'm only being
gender biased here

00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:39.220
because there's no
risk of pregnancy.

00:29:39.220 --> 00:29:42.130
So you're a single 25-year-old
male in perfect health.

00:29:42.130 --> 00:29:46.045
So the only risk you face health
wise is getting hit by a car.

00:29:46.045 --> 00:29:47.170
That's basically your risk.

00:29:47.170 --> 00:29:50.980
Otherwise, you're basically
not going to go to the doctor.

00:29:50.980 --> 00:29:56.770
So essentially, let's say
your income is $40,000.

00:29:56.770 --> 00:29:58.690
That's your income.

00:29:58.690 --> 00:30:01.930
And let's say that there's
a 1%-- since it's Cambridge,

00:30:01.930 --> 00:30:04.870
there's a non-trivial
chance you get hit by a car.

00:30:04.870 --> 00:30:09.940
Let's say there's a 1%
chance, probability 0.01,

00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:13.460
you'll get hit by
a car every year.

00:30:13.460 --> 00:30:19.890
And if you do, you're going to
face $30,000 in medical bills.

00:30:19.890 --> 00:30:22.970
So you have a $40,000 income.

00:30:22.970 --> 00:30:25.370
There's a 1% chance
you get hit by a car.

00:30:25.370 --> 00:30:28.515
And if you do, you'll face
$30,000 in medical bills.

00:30:28.515 --> 00:30:30.890
And let's assume for the minute
you'll still get to work.

00:30:30.890 --> 00:30:32.240
Your income will
always be there.

00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:33.710
You're just going to have to
face a bunch of medical bills.

00:30:33.710 --> 00:30:34.670
There's a separate
issue about whether you

00:30:34.670 --> 00:30:35.870
might have to miss your job.

00:30:35.870 --> 00:30:37.200
That makes this even worse.

00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:38.207
But let's ignore that.

00:30:38.207 --> 00:30:39.290
You get to go to your job.

00:30:39.290 --> 00:30:41.748
You're just going to have to
take a week to get patched up.

00:30:41.748 --> 00:30:45.530
And $30,000 is nothing, by
the way, for a hospital bill.

00:30:45.530 --> 00:30:47.990
A typical, for example,
heart attack hospital bill

00:30:47.990 --> 00:30:49.686
is well over $100,000.

00:30:49.686 --> 00:30:51.500
So $30,000 is pretty modest.

00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:52.376
Yeah.

00:30:52.376 --> 00:30:54.445
AUDIENCE: Wouldn't the
person that hit the guy

00:30:54.445 --> 00:30:56.570
have to get their insurance
cover the medical bill?

00:30:56.570 --> 00:30:58.770
JONATHAN GRUBER: Well, let's
ignore that for a second.

00:30:58.770 --> 00:31:01.070
Right now we're talking about
why you want insurance overall.

00:31:01.070 --> 00:31:02.120
We'll later get into who--

00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:04.240
we can discuss later who
should own that insurance, who

00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:05.115
should bear the risk.

00:31:05.115 --> 00:31:09.440
Right now it's just simply
why you'd want insurance.

00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:14.930
So the expected cost of
getting hit by a car--

00:31:14.930 --> 00:31:18.980
the expected value or expected
cost because it's negative--

00:31:18.980 --> 00:31:21.230
is minus 300.

00:31:21.230 --> 00:31:24.290
So every year you have
a $300 expected cost

00:31:24.290 --> 00:31:26.970
of getting hit by a car.

00:31:26.970 --> 00:31:30.660
And let's say your
utility function is

00:31:30.660 --> 00:31:32.640
u equal square root of c.

00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:34.140
And let's assume
there's no savings.

00:31:34.140 --> 00:31:35.307
You consume all your income.

00:31:38.590 --> 00:31:43.050
How much will this person be
willing to pay for insurance?

00:31:43.050 --> 00:31:46.670
Well, we can solve
that by asking

00:31:46.670 --> 00:31:50.300
at what insurance price
would they be better off

00:31:50.300 --> 00:31:54.080
being insured versus uninsured.

00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:56.740
So let's just do the math.

00:31:56.740 --> 00:32:03.680
If they're uninsured what's
going to happen to them?

00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:05.290
Well, what's their
expected utility?

00:32:05.290 --> 00:32:12.230
Well, there's a 0.1 chance
that they are going to get hit.

00:32:12.230 --> 00:32:17.110
And so their net income will
drop from 40,000 to 10,000

00:32:17.110 --> 00:32:19.340
because they'll have to pay
$30,000 in medical bills.

00:32:19.340 --> 00:32:23.900
So 0.1% chance their
net income be $10,000.

00:32:23.900 --> 00:32:30.010
And there's a 99% chance
that their net income

00:32:30.010 --> 00:32:35.230
will be $40,000.

00:32:35.230 --> 00:32:37.990
That's utility
without insurance.

00:32:37.990 --> 00:32:40.720
Add that up and you get 199.

00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:44.950
So their expected utility
without insurance is 199.

00:32:44.950 --> 00:32:50.662
That's their expected
utility with no insurance.

00:32:50.662 --> 00:32:52.120
Now let's do their
expected utility

00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:53.740
with insurance
but with insurance

00:32:53.740 --> 00:32:55.480
with an uncertain price.

00:32:55.480 --> 00:32:56.710
Let's call the price x.

00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:02.180
What's the utility
with insurance?

00:33:02.180 --> 00:33:09.190
Well, with insurance there's a
0.1% chance that they get hit.

00:33:09.190 --> 00:33:09.930
0.01, I'm sorry.

00:33:09.930 --> 00:33:10.820
It should be an .01.

00:33:10.820 --> 00:33:12.150
My bad.

00:33:12.150 --> 00:33:12.650
Wow.

00:33:12.650 --> 00:33:13.300
I can't believe you
guys missed that.

00:33:13.300 --> 00:33:15.380
You guys are a
little tired today.

00:33:15.380 --> 00:33:18.760
0.01.

00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:22.510
0.01% chance that I get hit.

00:33:22.510 --> 00:33:24.430
Now, if I get hit
with insurance,

00:33:24.430 --> 00:33:26.900
I don't have to pay
my medical bill.

00:33:26.900 --> 00:33:29.790
But I do have to pay
my insurance premium.

00:33:29.790 --> 00:33:35.530
So what I have is I
have $40,000 minus x,

00:33:35.530 --> 00:33:36.780
which is my insurance premium.

00:33:36.780 --> 00:33:38.488
I always have to pay
my insurance premium

00:33:38.488 --> 00:33:40.660
every year, no matter what.

00:33:40.660 --> 00:33:45.697
If I don't get hit,
then I get my 40,000,

00:33:45.697 --> 00:33:47.530
but I also have to pay
my insurance premium.

00:33:50.820 --> 00:33:52.680
So basically these
things are the same.

00:33:52.680 --> 00:33:58.650
So my expected utility is
square root of $40,000 minus x.

00:33:58.650 --> 00:34:02.010
That's my expected utility.

00:34:02.010 --> 00:34:04.280
So how do I solve
for the optimal x?

00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:07.610
Well, I ask at what
x am I better off

00:34:07.610 --> 00:34:09.650
than being uninsured?

00:34:09.650 --> 00:34:13.630
So I set this equal to 199.

00:34:13.630 --> 00:34:16.940
I ask at what x
would I be better off

00:34:16.940 --> 00:34:18.870
than being uninsured?

00:34:18.870 --> 00:34:25.010
And if you solve that, you
get that the x star, the point

00:34:25.010 --> 00:34:27.230
at which you would rather
be insured than uninsured,

00:34:27.230 --> 00:34:32.650
is a premium of $399.

00:34:32.650 --> 00:34:34.889
So you will pay--

00:34:34.889 --> 00:34:39.360
you would rather have
insurance at a cost of 399

00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:42.790
than you would go uninsured.

00:34:42.790 --> 00:34:45.100
Clear on that?

00:34:45.100 --> 00:34:47.440
You'd rather pay
a premium of 399

00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:50.130
than you would go uninsured.

00:34:50.130 --> 00:34:51.659
Now think about what that means.

00:34:51.659 --> 00:34:56.560
Remember, the expected cost of
this accident was only $300.

00:34:56.560 --> 00:35:02.575
That means that you
have a $99 risk premium.

00:35:06.150 --> 00:35:10.430
You are willing to pay $99
to avoid bearing this risk.

00:35:10.430 --> 00:35:11.930
That is what you're
willing to pay--

00:35:11.930 --> 00:35:14.610
before you were willing to
pay me $43.75 to get out

00:35:14.610 --> 00:35:15.600
of that gamble.

00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:17.390
That was your risk premium.

00:35:17.390 --> 00:35:21.540
It's how much you'll pay to
get out of taking a gamble.

00:35:21.540 --> 00:35:24.690
Now before I was
offering a gamble.

00:35:24.690 --> 00:35:25.680
But here's the thing.

00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:28.710
Being uninsured is a gamble.

00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:31.260
Being uninsured is
like taking the gamble.

00:35:31.260 --> 00:35:33.540
So the example I had before,
I locked you in the room.

00:35:33.540 --> 00:35:35.880
And you have to pay me if
you want avoid the bet.

00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:37.353
That's insurance.

00:35:37.353 --> 00:35:38.520
You are locked in this life.

00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:40.590
You're locked into
being in Cambridge.

00:35:40.590 --> 00:35:43.590
You're dealing with a 1% risk
getting hit by a car always.

00:35:43.590 --> 00:35:47.720
So the question is, how much
will you pay to avoid at least

00:35:47.720 --> 00:35:51.090
the financial cost-- forget the
trauma, the financial costs--

00:35:51.090 --> 00:35:53.220
of being hit by that car?

00:35:53.220 --> 00:35:57.090
And the answer is, you'll pay
$99 above the expected damage

00:35:57.090 --> 00:35:59.490
it will do.

00:35:59.490 --> 00:36:03.190
And that is why
insurance is big business

00:36:03.190 --> 00:36:10.100
because people will pay to avoid
being put in risky situations.

00:36:10.100 --> 00:36:12.262
So insurance is a very
profitable exploit.

00:36:12.262 --> 00:36:14.220
Now, in fact, of course,
the insurance industry

00:36:14.220 --> 00:36:15.080
is like any other industry.

00:36:15.080 --> 00:36:17.330
The supply side and
competition, and whether that

00:36:17.330 --> 00:36:19.310
will lead to profits
and stuff like that.

00:36:19.310 --> 00:36:21.080
Depends on the
whole supply side.

00:36:21.080 --> 00:36:22.822
This is just the demand side.

00:36:22.822 --> 00:36:24.280
But the point is
that there's going

00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:26.310
to be huge demand for
insurance, and people

00:36:26.310 --> 00:36:29.330
will be willing to pay much
more than it costs the insurance

00:36:29.330 --> 00:36:29.960
companies.

00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:32.720
The consumers expect
to pay the $300 a year.

00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:35.400
And they're getting almost
$400 a year in premium.

00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:39.290
So the insurance company
makes that money.

00:36:39.290 --> 00:36:42.780
And basically, that's why
insurance is big business.

00:36:42.780 --> 00:36:45.280
Now, here's a couple of things
I'd like you to show yourself

00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:49.160
in your copious spare time.

00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:52.190
First of all, this
risk premium should be

00:36:52.190 --> 00:36:55.900
bigger as the loss gets bigger.

00:36:55.900 --> 00:36:56.400
Why?

00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:58.400
Because you're moving
away from that linear part

00:36:58.400 --> 00:37:01.500
towards the nonlinear part
of the utility function.

00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:03.990
Similarly, this
risk premium should

00:37:03.990 --> 00:37:07.470
fall as your income is higher.

00:37:07.470 --> 00:37:07.970
Why?

00:37:07.970 --> 00:37:09.387
Because once again,
that makes you

00:37:09.387 --> 00:37:11.440
more towards the linear part.

00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:13.780
The bottom line is
the bigger the risk is

00:37:13.780 --> 00:37:17.313
relative to your income, the
more risk averse you become.

00:37:17.313 --> 00:37:19.480
The more you move from that
linear part of the curve

00:37:19.480 --> 00:37:22.330
onto the nonlinear
part of the curve.

00:37:22.330 --> 00:37:24.840
So that's the key thing.

00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:28.520
What matters is risk
relative to your income.

00:37:28.520 --> 00:37:30.920
That's going to determine
your value, your willingness

00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:32.130
to pay for insurance.

00:37:32.130 --> 00:37:35.890
So for example, let's
think of your decision

00:37:35.890 --> 00:37:39.200
to go buy consumer
electronics and the warranty.

00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:41.400
And they always
offer you a warranty.

00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:46.100
Now, those warranties are
expected value negative.

00:37:46.100 --> 00:37:48.680
If you take the
odds of your machine

00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:51.500
breaking-- if you go
to buy a new stereo.

00:37:51.500 --> 00:37:53.360
As if people buy
stereos anymore.

00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:55.940
You're going to
buy a car stereo.

00:37:55.940 --> 00:37:56.945
People still buy those.

00:37:56.945 --> 00:37:59.780
You're going to
buy a car stereo.

00:37:59.780 --> 00:38:02.510
You take the odds of that
breaking times the cost

00:38:02.510 --> 00:38:04.160
it would take to fix it.

00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:06.920
Those multiplied are less
than what they'll charge you

00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:09.260
for the insurance premium.

00:38:09.260 --> 00:38:12.995
It's a bad bet but
it's insurance.

00:38:12.995 --> 00:38:14.870
And so the question is,
should you take that?

00:38:14.870 --> 00:38:18.240
Well, that depends on
how wealthy you are.

00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:22.830
I should never take that because
my car radio cost is tiny

00:38:22.830 --> 00:38:24.610
relative to my income.

00:38:24.610 --> 00:38:26.680
Someone who has low
income might decide

00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:29.030
that's a large gamble
relative my income.

00:38:29.030 --> 00:38:30.140
I don't want to take that.

00:38:30.140 --> 00:38:35.250
So I want to buy the insurance
offered by the manufacturer.

00:38:35.250 --> 00:38:37.950
So once again, it's all
about the size of the risk

00:38:37.950 --> 00:38:39.120
relative to your income.

00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:39.620
Yeah.

00:38:39.620 --> 00:38:41.360
AUDIENCE: What if
I have increased

00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:43.260
chance of breaking my phone?

00:38:43.260 --> 00:38:44.160
JONATHAN GRUBER: Well,
that's a separate issue.

00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:45.327
We'll talk about that later.

00:38:45.327 --> 00:38:47.230
That's called moral hazard.

00:38:47.230 --> 00:38:48.990
You might-- well,
it's not moral hazard.

00:38:48.990 --> 00:38:51.390
What you're saying is
there's heterogeneity.

00:38:51.390 --> 00:38:54.900
And you know you're actually--
that for you it is a fair bet

00:38:54.900 --> 00:38:55.922
because you're clumsy.

00:38:55.922 --> 00:38:57.630
Well, then you should
definitely take it.

00:38:57.630 --> 00:38:58.920
This is saying
risk aversion works

00:38:58.920 --> 00:38:59.690
in favor of you taking it.

00:38:59.690 --> 00:39:01.855
Clumsiness further works
in favor of you taking it.

00:39:01.855 --> 00:39:03.730
And we'll talk about
that in a lecture or two

00:39:03.730 --> 00:39:08.790
when we talk about government
provision of insurance.

00:39:08.790 --> 00:39:10.775
So that's sort of the
first application,

00:39:10.775 --> 00:39:12.150
which is thinking
about insurance

00:39:12.150 --> 00:39:13.900
and why it's such big
business in America.

00:39:13.900 --> 00:39:17.070
And it is huge
business in America.

00:39:17.070 --> 00:39:19.140
The second application
is thinking

00:39:19.140 --> 00:39:21.420
about our friend the lottery.

00:39:21.420 --> 00:39:22.150
Big news lately.

00:39:22.150 --> 00:39:22.650
We talked.

00:39:22.650 --> 00:39:26.003
There was a couple of
huge lottery payouts.

00:39:26.003 --> 00:39:27.920
So let's talk about--
actually, let's do this.

00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:31.430
Let's talk about the lottery.

00:39:31.430 --> 00:39:36.620
Now, the lottery
is a total rip off.

00:39:36.620 --> 00:39:41.103
The expected value of a
lottery purchase is 50%.

00:39:41.103 --> 00:39:43.520
So every dollar you spend on
the lottery, over all lottery

00:39:43.520 --> 00:39:44.450
options--

00:39:44.450 --> 00:39:48.740
for every dollar you spend,
the expected payout is $0.50,

00:39:48.740 --> 00:39:53.000
is a much, much
less than fair bet.

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:55.010
And yet lotteries
are wildly popular.

00:39:55.010 --> 00:39:57.800
Actually, the beginnings
of this country, the US

00:39:57.800 --> 00:39:58.925
were financed by a lottery.

00:39:58.925 --> 00:40:01.008
Much of the money they
government raised initially

00:40:01.008 --> 00:40:02.840
to set up America
came from a lottery.

00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:05.660
And state lotteries are a huge
source of public financing

00:40:05.660 --> 00:40:08.960
right now across America.

00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:13.790
Now, why do people
play lotteries.

00:40:13.790 --> 00:40:15.920
Well, there's
basically four theories

00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:17.870
for why people play lotteries.

00:40:17.870 --> 00:40:20.330
The first is that
people are risk loving.

00:40:23.980 --> 00:40:26.140
In fact, that were wrong,
people are risk loving.

00:40:26.140 --> 00:40:27.580
That's why they play lotteries.

00:40:27.580 --> 00:40:29.080
How do we know that
theory is wrong?

00:40:31.395 --> 00:40:33.270
How do we know that
theory is its face wrong,

00:40:33.270 --> 00:40:34.437
that people are risk loving?

00:40:36.788 --> 00:40:37.348
Yeah.

00:40:37.348 --> 00:40:38.890
AUDIENCE: The
demonstration in class.

00:40:38.890 --> 00:40:41.353
Lots of didn't
raise their hands.

00:40:41.353 --> 00:40:43.520
JONATHAN GRUBER: Well,
that's one way we might know.

00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:45.320
But how do we know
more globally?

00:40:45.320 --> 00:40:47.180
You guys could just
be a weird bunch.

00:40:47.180 --> 00:40:47.940
How do you we know
more globally?

00:40:47.940 --> 00:40:48.440
Yeah.

00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:49.973
AUDIENCE: Because
of [INAUDIBLE]..

00:40:49.973 --> 00:40:50.890
JONATHAN GRUBER: Yeah.

00:40:50.890 --> 00:40:53.762
But that's absolutely
right, theoretically.

00:40:53.762 --> 00:40:54.720
But that's theoretical.

00:40:54.720 --> 00:40:56.570
In the real world, what
piece of evidence can

00:40:56.570 --> 00:40:57.800
you immediately point
to that I recently

00:40:57.800 --> 00:40:59.780
pointed out that could
show you this is wrong.

00:40:59.780 --> 00:40:59.990
Yeah.

00:40:59.990 --> 00:41:01.190
AUDIENCE: People buy insurance.

00:41:01.190 --> 00:41:02.420
JONATHAN GRUBER:
People buy insurance.

00:41:02.420 --> 00:41:04.610
If they're risk loving, why
are they buying insurance?

00:41:04.610 --> 00:41:06.210
So clearly people
aren't risk loving.

00:41:06.210 --> 00:41:08.230
We wouldn't spend 10%
of GDP on insurance.

00:41:08.230 --> 00:41:10.660
So that theory is clearly wrong.

00:41:10.660 --> 00:41:11.420
OK.

00:41:11.420 --> 00:41:13.150
That's theory one.

00:41:13.150 --> 00:41:16.270
Now, the second theory is
a somewhat subtler version

00:41:16.270 --> 00:41:19.150
of this theory, which
is quite interesting,

00:41:19.150 --> 00:41:23.980
which is that people are both
risk averse and risk loving.

00:41:23.980 --> 00:41:26.920
So that risk aversion varies.

00:41:26.920 --> 00:41:31.870
Risk tolerance, let's
call it, varies.

00:41:31.870 --> 00:41:33.520
And then in
particular, people are

00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:36.760
risk averse over small
gambles, but risk

00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:38.860
loving over big gambles.

00:41:38.860 --> 00:41:41.813
So let's look at figure 20-4.

00:41:41.813 --> 00:41:43.230
This is an example
of what we call

00:41:43.230 --> 00:41:44.703
Friedman-Savage preferences.

00:41:44.703 --> 00:41:45.870
You don't need to know that.

00:41:45.870 --> 00:41:48.480
But they had this idea that
maybe people are locally

00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:51.870
risk averse but
globally risk loving.

00:41:51.870 --> 00:41:53.170
Let's see what this--

00:41:53.170 --> 00:41:55.380
let me explain this.

00:41:55.380 --> 00:41:57.160
This is sort of complicated.

00:41:57.160 --> 00:42:00.420
So imagine that I'm
going to offer you

00:42:00.420 --> 00:42:07.970
a 50-50 gamble
between w1 and w3.

00:42:07.970 --> 00:42:10.850
So a gamble leaves you at w1
and a gamble leaves you at w3

00:42:10.850 --> 00:42:13.460
at 50% chance.

00:42:13.460 --> 00:42:15.650
Well, if we look at
between w1 and w3,

00:42:15.650 --> 00:42:19.020
we're on the concave part
of the utility function.

00:42:19.020 --> 00:42:21.680
And as a result, I will
not take that gamble.

00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:27.470
That gamble leaves me at point
B, which is below B star.

00:42:27.470 --> 00:42:30.020
So basically, I will
not take that gamble.

00:42:30.020 --> 00:42:33.500
That leaves me worse off than
just having w1 plus w3 over 2

00:42:33.500 --> 00:42:34.190
with certainty.

00:42:34.190 --> 00:42:36.050
This is just if you
hold your hand--

00:42:36.050 --> 00:42:38.210
if you hold your hands
between w1 and w3,

00:42:38.210 --> 00:42:40.400
that's just the
graph we saw before.

00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:43.240
You won't take that bet.

00:42:43.240 --> 00:42:45.700
But now let's say
once you get above w3,

00:42:45.700 --> 00:42:49.900
once you're rich enough,
you're risk loving.

00:42:49.900 --> 00:42:52.150
Let's say people are
risk averse at first

00:42:52.150 --> 00:42:53.680
but then get risk loving.

00:42:53.680 --> 00:42:55.240
So if you started it--

00:42:55.240 --> 00:42:59.570
if you said you were starting
at w3 plus w5 over 2,

00:42:59.570 --> 00:43:01.870
I'd offer you a gamble
between w3 and w5.

00:43:01.870 --> 00:43:04.300
Then you're risk
loving in that range.

00:43:04.300 --> 00:43:05.973
And you take it.

00:43:05.973 --> 00:43:08.390
So once you get rich enough,
you start to get risk loving.

00:43:08.390 --> 00:43:10.370
So I talked about before getting
rich or getting more and more

00:43:10.370 --> 00:43:11.662
risk neutral as you get richer.

00:43:11.662 --> 00:43:12.912
What if it goes the other way?

00:43:12.912 --> 00:43:15.410
What if you actually get risk
loving when you get richer?

00:43:15.410 --> 00:43:18.770
Well, then, if you think about
the whole Mega Millions thing,

00:43:18.770 --> 00:43:21.670
you could see that over the
whole distribution from w1

00:43:21.670 --> 00:43:25.110
to w5, people might
want to take that risk.

00:43:25.110 --> 00:43:29.250
That you could actually be
risk loving over these gambles,

00:43:29.250 --> 00:43:30.740
over these giant gambles.

00:43:30.740 --> 00:43:33.630
And that could explain why
people play Mega Millions.

00:43:33.630 --> 00:43:35.130
That over the giant
gambles, they're

00:43:35.130 --> 00:43:38.000
risk loving, even if over
more moderate gambles

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:39.190
they're risk averse.

00:43:39.190 --> 00:43:41.190
You don't insure yourself
for a billion dollars.

00:43:41.190 --> 00:43:43.180
You insure yourself for
a few thousand dollars.

00:43:43.180 --> 00:43:43.420
Yeah.

00:43:43.420 --> 00:43:45.810
AUDIENCE: How does the size of
the gamble we're talking about

00:43:45.810 --> 00:43:47.768
determine-- we're talking
about small bets that

00:43:47.768 --> 00:43:51.210
are more linear, is it based
on what the player puts in

00:43:51.210 --> 00:43:52.830
or what they get in return?

00:43:52.830 --> 00:43:54.141
JONATHAN GRUBER: Both.

00:43:54.141 --> 00:43:54.820
Both.

00:43:54.820 --> 00:43:57.430
It's basically about--
it's about expected utility

00:43:57.430 --> 00:43:58.373
calculations.

00:43:58.373 --> 00:43:59.790
Yes, it's true,
for Mega Millions,

00:43:59.790 --> 00:44:02.590
you put in $2 for the chance
of winning $1.6 billion.

00:44:02.590 --> 00:44:06.830
But your probability is way,
way lower than 2 in 1.6 billion.

00:44:06.830 --> 00:44:09.510
So it's still unfair.

00:44:09.510 --> 00:44:12.057
So the Friedman-Savage
hypothesis--

00:44:12.057 --> 00:44:13.890
you don't need to know
the name, once again.

00:44:13.890 --> 00:44:15.930
This hypothesis is
that what's happening

00:44:15.930 --> 00:44:20.030
is that people are first risk
averse, but then risk loving.

00:44:20.030 --> 00:44:24.350
Well, how could we test and
actually disprove this theory?

00:44:24.350 --> 00:44:25.032
Yeah.

00:44:25.032 --> 00:44:26.450
AUDIENCE: Like scratch offs.

00:44:26.450 --> 00:44:27.367
JONATHAN GRUBER: Yeah.

00:44:27.367 --> 00:44:29.600
If this is true, people
would love Mega Millions

00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:31.940
but hate $10 scratch offs.

00:44:31.940 --> 00:44:34.400
In fact, the vast majority
of lottery playing

00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:35.690
is not Mega Millions.

00:44:35.690 --> 00:44:37.340
It's $10 scratch off.

00:44:37.340 --> 00:44:40.600
Most money spent on lotteries
are $10 and $20 gambles

00:44:40.600 --> 00:44:43.720
where you bet $1
to win $10 or $20.

00:44:43.720 --> 00:44:46.660
You should be risk averse over
that, or at best risk neutral.

00:44:46.660 --> 00:44:49.480
You shouldn't be risk loving
over those tiny gambles.

00:44:49.480 --> 00:44:52.310
And yet that's most of
what lottery players do.

00:44:52.310 --> 00:44:55.570
AUDIENCE: Wouldn't not
really a scratch off be

00:44:55.570 --> 00:45:00.700
counted internally as not
getting money instead of losing

00:45:00.700 --> 00:45:01.460
money?

00:45:01.460 --> 00:45:01.870
JONATHAN GRUBER:
Well, no, but you've

00:45:01.870 --> 00:45:03.250
lost the dollar you spent.

00:45:03.250 --> 00:45:04.480
And that dollar--

00:45:04.480 --> 00:45:07.380
I still offered you a gamble.

00:45:07.380 --> 00:45:11.310
Spend $1, win $10, with
a 0.05 probability.

00:45:11.310 --> 00:45:13.750
AUDIENCE: I mean, in
the loss averse sense.

00:45:13.750 --> 00:45:14.880
JONATHAN GRUBER: Well, we're
not doing loss aversion.

00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:15.840
Loss aversion is sort of hard.

00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:16.860
You don't have to
think about gambling.

00:45:16.860 --> 00:45:18.240
Loss aversion is
more about losing.

00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:20.310
But in the regular-- you
can see you shouldn't do

00:45:20.310 --> 00:45:21.900
that unless you're risk loving.

00:45:21.900 --> 00:45:24.730
But even this theory would say
you're not locally risk loving.

00:45:24.730 --> 00:45:26.940
So this theory is
out, which leaves us

00:45:26.940 --> 00:45:28.590
with two more theories.

00:45:28.590 --> 00:45:33.920
The first theory is that
this is entertainment.

00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:37.360
That in people's
utility function

00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:39.450
is not just consumption
but the thrill

00:45:39.450 --> 00:45:42.430
of finding out if they won.

00:45:42.430 --> 00:45:43.930
My wife, against
my better judgment,

00:45:43.930 --> 00:45:46.860
went out and bought a
Mega Millions ticket.

00:45:46.860 --> 00:45:49.320
And she got utility
out of waiting

00:45:49.320 --> 00:45:50.807
for that number to come up.

00:45:50.807 --> 00:45:52.140
And it was pretty cheap utility.

00:45:52.140 --> 00:45:54.210
Cost her $2.

00:45:54.210 --> 00:45:57.260
So in that sense, maybe
you play the lottery a lot

00:45:57.260 --> 00:45:59.150
for entertainment.

00:45:59.150 --> 00:46:01.520
That's one theory,
unfortunately,

00:46:01.520 --> 00:46:07.600
the other theory is ignorance.

00:46:07.600 --> 00:46:09.560
That basically, the
saying is the lottery

00:46:09.560 --> 00:46:12.380
is a tax on the stupid.

00:46:12.380 --> 00:46:16.860
Basically just don't understand
what a bad deal this is.

00:46:16.860 --> 00:46:19.440
And the problem is we don't
know which of these theories

00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:20.880
is right.

00:46:20.880 --> 00:46:22.933
And they have very
different implications

00:46:22.933 --> 00:46:23.850
for government policy.

00:46:26.790 --> 00:46:29.950
If this theory is right,
if this theory is right,

00:46:29.950 --> 00:46:32.460
then the government
should support lotteries,

00:46:32.460 --> 00:46:34.470
where essentially the
government is essentially

00:46:34.470 --> 00:46:37.450
getting paid for
providing entertainment.

00:46:37.450 --> 00:46:40.682
It's what the lotteries
often call the voluntary tax.

00:46:40.682 --> 00:46:42.640
That I am basically giving
the government money

00:46:42.640 --> 00:46:43.840
that can run our
schools in return

00:46:43.840 --> 00:46:45.550
for the government giving me the
entertainment value of seeing

00:46:45.550 --> 00:46:46.840
if my scratch off won.

00:46:46.840 --> 00:46:48.100
That's great.

00:46:48.100 --> 00:46:51.080
That's welfare improving.

00:46:51.080 --> 00:46:58.345
Under this theory, we should
be discouraging lotteries.

00:46:58.345 --> 00:47:00.720
That all we're doing is taking
a bunch of ignorant people

00:47:00.720 --> 00:47:03.054
and getting them to
waste their money.

00:47:03.054 --> 00:47:04.445
Yeah.

00:47:04.445 --> 00:47:06.070
AUDIENCE: Is there
almost a possibility

00:47:06.070 --> 00:47:09.300
that there is this concept
of having nothing to lose.

00:47:09.300 --> 00:47:12.650
If you're already too
poor to be able to afford

00:47:12.650 --> 00:47:14.830
your basic needs,
then you might feel

00:47:14.830 --> 00:47:17.270
like, I may as well
try and win the lottery

00:47:17.270 --> 00:47:18.910
and then I would be all set.

00:47:18.910 --> 00:47:19.580
That is--

00:47:19.580 --> 00:47:20.413
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:47:20.413 --> 00:47:23.980
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:23.980 --> 00:47:26.060
JONATHAN GRUBER:
That's exactly this.

00:47:26.060 --> 00:47:28.705
That wouldn't explain why
I'd pay the $20 scratch off.

00:47:28.705 --> 00:47:30.080
That's an absolute
reason why I'd

00:47:30.080 --> 00:47:31.455
go ahead, even if
I was starving,

00:47:31.455 --> 00:47:32.730
and play the Mega Millions.

00:47:32.730 --> 00:47:35.120
And that's the Friedman-Savage
hypothesis, absolutely.

00:47:35.120 --> 00:47:38.330
But that can't explain why
in fact, in some low income

00:47:38.330 --> 00:47:40.730
communities, among
some low income groups,

00:47:40.730 --> 00:47:43.070
they'll spend as much
as 20% of their income

00:47:43.070 --> 00:47:47.030
every year on the
lottery, a net.

00:47:47.030 --> 00:47:51.260
They're losing huge amounts of
money on scratch off tickets.

00:47:51.260 --> 00:47:54.140
So the question is, is
that a rational decision

00:47:54.140 --> 00:47:55.910
because they find
it entertaining

00:47:55.910 --> 00:47:57.952
or an irrational decision
because they just don't

00:47:57.952 --> 00:47:59.840
understand what's going on?

00:47:59.840 --> 00:48:02.270
And unfortunately, we
don't know the answer.

00:48:02.270 --> 00:48:05.013
But we do know it's
very important.

00:48:05.013 --> 00:48:06.680
It's important because
there's big bucks

00:48:06.680 --> 00:48:08.720
and in many low
income communities

00:48:08.720 --> 00:48:10.785
it's a huge source
of expenditure.

00:48:10.785 --> 00:48:12.410
So I can't give you
the answer to that.

00:48:12.410 --> 00:48:13.490
I can just tell you it's
an important question.

00:48:13.490 --> 00:48:14.990
I hope someday
someone to figure out

00:48:14.990 --> 00:48:16.657
how to think about
this because it's got

00:48:16.657 --> 00:48:18.060
very important implications.

00:48:18.060 --> 00:48:19.040
So let me stop there.

00:48:19.040 --> 00:48:20.832
That's all I want to
say about uncertainty.

00:48:20.832 --> 00:48:25.000
And we'll come back and do
another topic on Wednesday.

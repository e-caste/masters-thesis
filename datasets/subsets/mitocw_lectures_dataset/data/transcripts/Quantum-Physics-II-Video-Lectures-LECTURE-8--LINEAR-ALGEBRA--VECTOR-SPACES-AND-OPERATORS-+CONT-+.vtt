00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.960
PROFESSOR: It's good to be back.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.930
I really want to thank
both Aaron and Will who

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:34.890
took my teaching
duties over last week.

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.340
You've been receiving
updates of the lecture notes,

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.700
and, in particular,
as I don't want

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.980
to go back over
some things, I would

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.980
like you to read some of
the material you have there.

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.500
In particular, the
part on projectors

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.460
has been developed further.

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:02.670
We will meet projectors
a lot in this space,

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.420
because in quantum mechanics,
whenever you do a measurement,

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.392
the effect of a
measurement is to act

00:01:11.392 --> 00:01:14.260
on a stage with a projector.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.530
So projectors are
absolutely important.

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.920
And orthogonal
projectors are the ones

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.990
that we're going to
use-- are the ones that

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.850
are relevant in
quantum mechanics.

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.470
There's a property, for
example, of projectors

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.250
that is quite neat that is used
in maximization and fitting

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:33.990
problems.

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.800
And you will see
that in the PSET.

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.820
In the PSET, the
last problem has

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.330
to do with using a
projector to find

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.750
best approximations to some
functions using polynomials.

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.010
So there's lots of things
to say about projectors,

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:57.870
and we'll find them along
when we go and do later stuff

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:58.490
in the course.

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:03.820
So please read that
part on projectors.

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:08.490
The other thing is that much
of what we're going to do

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:15.740
uses the notation that we have
for describing inner products--

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:22.370
for example, u, v. And
then, as we've mentioned,

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.250
and this is in the notes--
this, in the bracket notation,

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.920
becomes something like this.

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.800
And the bracket notation
of quantum mechanics

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.610
is fairly nice for
many things, and it's

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.560
used sometimes for
some applications.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.150
Everybody uses the bracket
notation for some applications.

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.910
I hope to get to
one of those today.

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:53.660
So much of the theory
we've developed

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:58.120
is done with this as
the inner product.

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.260
Nevertheless, the translation
to the language of bras and kets

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.190
is very quick.

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.830
So the way the notes are
going to be structured--

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:09.160
and we're still
working on the notes,

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:10.720
and they're going
to chang a bit--

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.670
is that everything
regarding the math

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.070
is being developed
more in this notation,

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:19.480
but then we turn
into bras and kets

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.490
and just go quickly
over all you've

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:26.130
seen, just how it looks
with bras and kets

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.970
so that you're familiar.

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.080
Then, in the later
part of the course,

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.820
we'll use sometimes bras and
kets, and sometimes this.

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:37.220
And sometimes some
physicisists use

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.223
this notation with parentheses.

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:44.560
So for example,
Weinberg's recent book

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.735
on quantum mechanics
uses this notation.

00:03:46.735 --> 00:03:49.905
It doesn't use bras and
kets I think at all.

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:56.890
So you have to be ready
to work with any notation.

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:01.290
The bra and ket notation
has some nice properties

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:05.140
that make it very fast
to do things with it.

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:06.740
It is very efficient.

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:12.410
Nevertheless, in some ways this
notation is a little clearer.

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:17.160
So many of the things we'll
develop is with this notation.

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.350
So today I'm going
to develop the idea

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:22.190
of the Hermitian
conjugator for an operator,

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:24.440
or the adjoint of an operator.

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:31.630
And this idea is generally a
little subtle, a little hard

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:33.140
to understand.

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:38.200
But we'll just go at it slowly
and try to make it very clear.

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:44.100
So adjoints or Hermitian
operators, or Hermitian

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:54.260
conjugates-- adjoints
or Hermitian conjugates.

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:06.250
So the idea of Adjoints,
or Hermition conjugates,

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:14.220
really begins with some
necessary background

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:18.640
on what they're called--
linear functionals.

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:20.800
It sounds complicated,
but it's not.

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.270
What is a linear functional?

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:33.440
A linear functional
on V-- on a vector

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:44.250
space V-- is a linear
map from V to the numbers

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:48.870
F. We've always been
calling F the numbers.

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:53.060
So it's just that, something
that, once you have a vector,

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:55.120
you get a number
and it's linear.

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:02.900
So a linear function of Phi,
if it's a linear functional,

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:11.880
Phi on v belongs to F.
Phi acts on a vector, v,

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:15.720
that belongs to the vector
space and gives you a number.

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:25.710
So "linear" means Phi of v1 plus
v2 is Phi of v1 plus Phi of v2.

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:33.950
And Phi of av, for a is
number, is a Phi of v.

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:39.120
So seems simple,
and indeed it is.

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:43.430
And we can construct examples
of linear functionals,

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:45.515
some trivial ones, for example.

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:58.030
Let Phi be a map that takes the
vector space, reals in three

00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:00.840
dimensions, to the real numbers.

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:02.950
So how does it act?

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:09.000
Phi acts on a vector, which
is x1, x2, and x3-- three

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.190
components.

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:13.680
And it must give
a numbers, so it

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:21.170
could be 3x1 minus x2 plus
7x3, as simple as that.

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:26.480
It's linear.

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:31.560
x1, x2, and x3 are the
coordinates of a single vector.

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:34.780
And whenever you have
this vector, that is,

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:37.530
this triplet-- now, I
could have written it

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:42.445
like this-- Phi of x1,
x2, and x3, as a vector.

00:07:42.445 --> 00:07:43.770
It looks like that.

00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:47.600
But it's easier to use
horizontal notation,

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:51.785
so we'll write it like that.

00:07:51.785 --> 00:07:55.060
And, if you have
an inner product

00:07:55.060 --> 00:08:01.170
on this space-- on this three
dimensional vector space--

00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:03.570
there's something you can say.

00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:07.810
Actually this Phi is
equal-- and this we

00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:15.900
call the vector V-- is
actually equal to u,

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:22.020
inner product with v, where u is
the vector that has components

00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:26.860
3, minus 1, and
7, because if you

00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:30.810
take the inner product of
this vector with this vector,

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:34.659
in three dimensions
real vector spaces--

00:08:34.659 --> 00:08:37.380
inner product is a dot product.

00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:42.970
And then we make the dot
product of u with the vector V.

00:08:42.970 --> 00:08:46.270
Maybe I should have
called it v1, v2, v3.

00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:53.360
I'll change that--
v1, v2, v3 here

00:08:53.360 --> 00:09:01.950
are components of the
vector-- v1, v2, and v3,

00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:04.190
not to be confused
with three vectors.

00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:10.890
This whole thing is a vector
V. So this linear functional,

00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:14.650
that, given a vector
gives me a number.

00:09:14.650 --> 00:09:18.050
The clever thing is
that the inner product

00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:20.730
is this thing that gives
you numbers out of vectors.

00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:25.100
So you've reconstructed
this linear functional

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:30.120
as the inner product of some
vector with the vector you're

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:33.490
acting on, so, where
u is given by that.

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:42.770
The most important result
about linear functionals

00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:45.610
is that this is not an accident.

00:09:45.610 --> 00:09:48.190
This kind be that
very generally.

00:09:48.190 --> 00:09:51.960
So any time you give
me a linear functional,

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:57.930
I can find a vector that,
using the inner product,

00:09:57.930 --> 00:10:01.620
acts on the vector you're
acting on the same way

00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:05.480
as the linear function of thus.

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:08.540
The most general
linear functional

00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:13.320
is just some most general
vector acting this way.

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:16.800
So let's state
that and prove it.

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:20.190
So this is a theorem, it's
not a definition or anything

00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:22.370
like that.

00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:34.820
Let Phi be a linear
functional on v. Then

00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:48.800
there is a unique vector u
belonging to the vector space

00:10:48.800 --> 00:11:10.370
such that Phi acting
on v is equal to u, v.

00:11:10.370 --> 00:11:13.360
Since this is such
a canonical thing,

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:15.490
you could even
invent a notation.

00:11:15.490 --> 00:11:20.760
Call this the linear
functional created by u,

00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:25.250
acting on v. Everybody
doesn't use this,

00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:27.860
but you could call it like that.

00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:30.870
This is a linear
functional acting on v,

00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:34.180
but it's labeled by u, which
is the vector that you've

00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:34.900
use there.

00:11:38.945 --> 00:11:43.210
This is important enough that we
better understand why it works.

00:11:43.210 --> 00:11:44.930
So I'll prove it.

00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:56.070
We're going to use
an orthonormal basis,

00:11:56.070 --> 00:12:07.582
say e1 up to en is an
orthonormal, O-N, basis.

00:12:07.582 --> 00:12:09.040
AUDIENCE: That
means we're assuming

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:10.532
v is finite dimensional here?

00:12:10.532 --> 00:12:11.240
PROFESSOR: Sorry?

00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:13.656
AUDIENCE: We're assuming V is
finite dimensional, correct?

00:12:16.459 --> 00:12:18.125
PROFESSOR: Yeah, it's
finite dimensional

00:12:18.125 --> 00:12:22.776
I'm going to prove it using
a finite basis like that.

00:12:22.776 --> 00:12:24.790
Is true finite dimensional?

00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:27.050
I presume yes.

00:12:27.050 --> 00:12:28.529
AUDIENCE: If it's
not [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:33.813 --> 00:12:34.938
PROFESSOR: What hypothesis?

00:12:34.938 --> 00:12:37.403
AUDIENCE: You say continuous
when you're talking

00:12:37.403 --> 00:12:38.890
[INAUDIBLE].

00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:41.745
PROFESSOR: OK, I'll check.

00:12:41.745 --> 00:12:46.280
But let's just prove this one
finite dimensional like this.

00:12:50.990 --> 00:12:51.980
Let's take that.

00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:57.800
And now write the vector as a
superposition of these vectors.

00:12:57.800 --> 00:12:59.900
Now we know how to do that.

00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:07.560
We just have the components
of v along each basis vector.

00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:11.700
For example, the
component of v along e1

00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:15.560
is precisely e1, v.
So then you go on

00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:22.350
like that until
you go en, v, en.

00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:31.150
I think you've derived this
a couple of times already,

00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:33.920
but this is a statement
you can review,

00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:38.410
and let's take it to be correct.

00:13:38.410 --> 00:13:44.540
Now let's consider what is
Phi acting on a v like that.

00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:48.960
Well, it's a linear map, so
it takes on a sum of vectors

00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:51.630
by acting on the
vectors, each one.

00:13:51.630 --> 00:13:53.970
So it should act on from
this plus that, plus that,

00:13:53.970 --> 00:13:54.800
plus that.

00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:57.610
Now, it acts on this vector.

00:13:57.610 --> 00:13:59.200
Well, this is a number.

00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:00.840
The number goes out.

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:02.100
It's a linear function.

00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:19.190
So this is e1, v, Phi of e1, all
the way up to en, v Phi of en.

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:30.320
Now this is a number,
so let's bring it

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:32.060
into the inner product.

00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:35.820
Now, if you brought it in
on the side of V as a number

00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:37.850
it would go in just
like the number.

00:14:37.850 --> 00:14:40.230
If you bring it
into the left side,

00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:43.200
remember it's
conjugate homogeneous,

00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:45.750
so this enters as
a complex number.

00:14:45.750 --> 00:15:05.730
So this would be e1, Phi of
e1 star times V plus en, Phi

00:15:05.730 --> 00:15:23.240
of en star, v. And then we have
our result that this Phi of v

00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:25.050
has been written now.

00:15:25.050 --> 00:15:29.690
The left input is different
on each of these terms,

00:15:29.690 --> 00:15:31.630
but the right input is the same.

00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:36.120
So at this moment linearity
on the first input

00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:46.240
says that you can put here e1,
Phi of e1 star plus up to en,

00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:57.950
Phi of en star, v. And this
is the vector you were looking

00:15:57.950 --> 00:16:05.030
for, the vector U. Kind of
simple, at the end of the day

00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:09.300
you just used the basis
and made it clearer.

00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:11.180
It can always be constructed.

00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:21.590
Basically, the vector you want
is e1 times Phi of u1 star

00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:24.270
plus en up to Phi of en star.

00:16:24.270 --> 00:16:27.900
So if you know what the linear
map does to the basis vectors,

00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:31.640
you construct the
vector this way.

00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:33.780
Vector is done.

00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:37.760
The only thing to be
proven is that it's unique.

00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:43.210
Uniqueness is rather easy
to prove at this stage.

00:16:43.210 --> 00:16:48.260
Suppose you know that u
with v works and gives you

00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:49.240
the right answer.

00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:51.660
Well, you ask, is
there a u prime

00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:56.570
that also gives the
right answer for all v?

00:16:56.570 --> 00:16:58.970
Well, pass it to the
other side, and you

00:16:58.970 --> 00:17:04.550
would have u minus u prime,
would have zero inner product

00:17:04.550 --> 00:17:11.740
with v for all v. Pass
to the other side,

00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:14.010
take the difference,
and it's that.

00:17:14.010 --> 00:17:16.410
So u minus u prime
is a vector that

00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:19.720
has zero inner product
with any vector.

00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:23.319
And any such thing
as always zero.

00:17:23.319 --> 00:17:27.109
And perhaps the easiest way
to show that, in case you

00:17:27.109 --> 00:17:30.730
haven't seen that
before, if x with v

00:17:30.730 --> 00:17:39.053
equals 0 for all for all v.
What can you say about x?

00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:46.880
Well, take v is the value
for any v. So take v equal x.

00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:50.050
So you take x, x is equal to 0.

00:17:50.050 --> 00:17:52.840
And by the axioms of
the inner product,

00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:59.130
if a vector has 0 inner
product with itself, it's 0.

00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:04.290
So at this stage, you go
u minus u prime equals 0,

00:18:04.290 --> 00:18:06.470
and u is equal to u prime.

00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:10.070
So it's definitely
unique, you can't

00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:11.755
find another one that works.

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:20.250
So we have this thing.

00:18:20.250 --> 00:18:21.875
This theorem is proven.

00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:29.220
And now let's use to
define this the adjoint,

00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:32.310
which is a very
interesting thing.

00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:36.700
So the adjoing, or
Hermitian conjugate,

00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:42.130
sometimes called
adjoint-- physicists

00:18:42.130 --> 00:18:48.320
use the name Hermitian
conjugate, which

00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:49.487
is more appropriate.

00:18:49.487 --> 00:18:51.320
Well, I don't know if
it's more appropriate.

00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:57.260
It's more pictorial if you
have a complex vector space.

00:18:57.260 --> 00:19:00.460
And if you're accustomed
with linear algebra

00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:03.490
about Hermition matrices,
and what they are,

00:19:03.490 --> 00:19:06.085
and that will show
up a little later,

00:19:06.085 --> 00:19:10.610
although with a
very curious twist.

00:19:10.610 --> 00:19:18.170
So given an operator T belonging
to the set of linear operators

00:19:18.170 --> 00:19:26.950
on a vector space, you
can define T dagger,

00:19:26.950 --> 00:19:33.730
also belonging to
l of v. So this

00:19:33.730 --> 00:19:38.420
is the aim-- constructing an
operator called the Hermitian

00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:40.816
conjugate.

00:19:40.816 --> 00:19:43.370
Now the way we're
going to do it is

00:19:43.370 --> 00:19:47.940
going to be defining
something that is a T star.

00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:51.130
Well, I said "T star" because
mathematicians in fact

00:19:51.130 --> 00:19:52.810
call it star.

00:19:52.810 --> 00:19:55.320
And most mathematicians,
they complex conjugate

00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:59.290
if a number is not
z star but z bar.

00:19:59.290 --> 00:20:03.200
So that's why we
call it T star and I

00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:06.060
may make this mistake
a few times today.

00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:09.120
We're going to use dagger.

00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:12.150
And so I will make
a definition that

00:20:12.150 --> 00:20:16.400
will tell you what T
dagger is supposed to be,

00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:17.540
acting on things.

00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:20.860
But it might not be obvious,
at least at first sight,

00:20:20.860 --> 00:20:23.070
that it's a linear operator.

00:20:23.070 --> 00:20:29.030
So let's see how does this go.

00:20:29.030 --> 00:20:30.390
Here is the claim.

00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:37.590
Consider the
following thing-- u,

00:20:37.590 --> 00:20:51.380
T, v-- this inner product of
u with T, v. And think of it

00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:53.510
as a linear functional.

00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:56.820
Well, it's certainly
a linear functional

00:20:56.820 --> 00:21:05.380
of v. It's a linear
functional because if you

00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:08.550
put a times v the a goes out.

00:21:08.550 --> 00:21:11.970
And if you put v1 plus
v2 you get it's linear.

00:21:11.970 --> 00:21:15.150
So it's linear, but
it's not the usual one's

00:21:15.150 --> 00:21:20.590
that we've been building, in
which the linear functional

00:21:20.590 --> 00:21:26.700
looks like u with v. I
just put an operator there.

00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:36.700
So by this theorem,
there must be some vector

00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:40.210
that this can be
represented as this acting

00:21:40.210 --> 00:21:46.180
with that vector inside here,
because any linear operator is

00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:49.400
some vector acting on the
vector-- on the vector

00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:54.720
v. Any linear functional, I'm
sorry-- not linear operator.

00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:57.940
Any linear functional--
this is a linear functional.

00:21:57.940 --> 00:22:01.730
And every linear function can
be written as some vector acting

00:22:01.730 --> 00:22:05.430
on v. So there must
be a vector here.

00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:12.160
Now this vector surely
will depend on what u is.

00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:13.760
So we'll give it a name.

00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:26.260
It's a vector that depends on
U. I'll write it as T dagger u.

00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:37.360
At this moment, T dagger
is just a map from v

00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:42.320
to v. We said that this
thing that we must put here

00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:45.860
depends on u, and
it must be a vector.

00:22:45.860 --> 00:22:49.310
So it's some thing that
takes u and produces

00:22:49.310 --> 00:22:54.300
another vector
called T dagger on u.

00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:56.440
But we don't know
what T dagger is,

00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:58.225
and we don't even
know that it's linear.

00:23:00.820 --> 00:23:05.530
So at this moment it's just
a map, and it's a definition.

00:23:05.530 --> 00:23:13.020
This defines what T dagger
u is, because some vector--

00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:17.590
it could be calculated exactly
the same way we calculated

00:23:17.590 --> 00:23:20.160
the other ones.

00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:27.270
So let's try to see
why it is linear.

00:23:27.270 --> 00:23:38.280
Claim T dagger belongs to
the linear operators in v.

00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:39.640
So how do we do that?

00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:41.120
Well, we can say the following.

00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:47.032
Consider u1 plus
u1 acting on Tv.

00:23:49.960 --> 00:24:01.700
Well, by definition, this would
be the T dagger of u1 plus u2,

00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:07.160
some function on u1 plus
u2, because whatever is here

00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:12.570
gets acted by T dagger
times v. On the other hand,

00:24:12.570 --> 00:24:20.970
this thing is equal
to u1, Tv plus u2,

00:24:20.970 --> 00:24:39.200
Tv, which is equal to T dagger
u1, v plus T dagger u2, v.

00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:48.700
And, by linearity, here you
get equal to T dagger u1 plus T

00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:50.590
dagger on u2.

00:24:55.740 --> 00:24:59.680
And then comparing this too--
and this is true for arbitrary

00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:05.080
v-- you find that T dagger,
acting on this sum of vectors,

00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:06.960
is the same as this thing.

00:25:10.930 --> 00:25:20.078
And similarly, how about au, Tv?

00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:41.060
Well, this is equal to T dagger
on au, v. Now, T dagger on au,

00:25:41.060 --> 00:25:44.500
do you think the a goes
out as a or as a bar?

00:25:47.830 --> 00:25:49.386
Sorry?

00:25:49.386 --> 00:25:51.110
a or a-bar?

00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:55.120
What do you think T dagger
and au is supposed to be?

00:25:55.120 --> 00:26:01.730
a, because it's supposed to be
a linear operator, so no dagger

00:26:01.730 --> 00:26:02.230
here.

00:26:02.230 --> 00:26:05.920
You see-- well, I
didn't show it here.

00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:11.770
Any linear operator, T on av,
is supposed to be a T of v.

00:26:11.770 --> 00:26:13.800
And we're saying
T dagger is also

00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:17.360
a linear operator
in the vector space.

00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:20.850
So this should be with an a.

00:26:20.850 --> 00:26:22.010
We'll see what we get.

00:26:22.010 --> 00:26:34.010
Well, the a can go out here,
and it becomes a star u1, Tv,

00:26:34.010 --> 00:26:35.220
which is equal.

00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:37.250
I'm going through the left side.

00:26:37.250 --> 00:26:43.600
By definition, a
bar T dagger of u,

00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:47.470
v. And now the
constant can go in,

00:26:47.470 --> 00:26:54.330
and it goes back as
a, T dagger u, v. So

00:26:54.330 --> 00:26:59.100
this must be equal
to that, and you

00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:07.340
get what we're claiming here,
which is T dagger on au,

00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:10.420
is equal to a T dagger of u.

00:27:13.010 --> 00:27:17.200
So the operator is linear.

00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:25.720
So we've defined something
this way, and it's linear,

00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:30.030
and it's doing all
the right things.

00:27:30.030 --> 00:27:33.470
Now, you really feel
proud at this stage.

00:27:33.470 --> 00:27:36.470
This is still not
all that intuitive.

00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:38.600
What does this all do?

00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:41.230
So we're going to do
an example, and we're

00:27:41.230 --> 00:27:46.710
going to do one more property.

00:27:46.710 --> 00:27:49.660
Let me do one more property
and then stop for a second.

00:27:49.660 --> 00:27:56.220
So here is one property--
ST dagger is supposed to be

00:27:56.220 --> 00:27:58.290
T dagger S dagger.

00:27:58.290 --> 00:28:00.210
So how do you get that?

00:28:00.210 --> 00:28:03.970
Not hard-- u, STv.

00:28:06.700 --> 00:28:12.300
Well, STv is really the
same as S acting on Tv.

00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:15.330
Now the first S can be
brought to the other side

00:28:15.330 --> 00:28:19.610
by the definition that
you can bring something

00:28:19.610 --> 00:28:20.830
to the other side.

00:28:20.830 --> 00:28:22.220
Put in a dagger.

00:28:22.220 --> 00:28:24.550
So the S is brought
there, and you

00:28:24.550 --> 00:28:33.060
get S dagger on u, T on v. And
then the T can be brought here

00:28:33.060 --> 00:28:40.450
and act on this one, and
you get T dagger S dagger u,

00:28:40.450 --> 00:28:48.670
v. So this thing is the
dagger of this thing,

00:28:48.670 --> 00:28:50.230
and that's the statement here.

00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:57.540
There's yet one more
simple property,

00:28:57.540 --> 00:29:09.320
that the dagger of S dagger
is S. You take dagger twice

00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:11.550
and you're back to
the same operator.

00:29:11.550 --> 00:29:13.570
Nothing has changed.

00:29:13.570 --> 00:29:17.062
So how do you do that?

00:29:17.062 --> 00:29:24.120
Take, for example, this-- take
u, put S dagger here, and put

00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:33.740
v. Now, by definition,
this is equal to-- you

00:29:33.740 --> 00:29:37.000
put the operator on the
other side, adding a dagger.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:44.655
So that's why we put
that one like this.

00:29:44.655 --> 00:29:47.540
The operator gets
daggers, so now you've

00:29:47.540 --> 00:29:49.410
got the double dagger.

00:29:49.410 --> 00:29:52.540
So at this moment,
however, you have

00:29:52.540 --> 00:29:57.170
to do something
to simplify this.

00:29:57.170 --> 00:30:00.470
The easiest thing to do is
probably the following--

00:30:00.470 --> 00:30:02.760
to just flip these
two, which you

00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:08.170
can do the order
by putting a star.

00:30:08.170 --> 00:30:10.230
So this is equal.

00:30:10.230 --> 00:30:12.155
The left hand side
is equal to this.

00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:22.406
And now this S dagger can be
moved here and becomes an S.

00:30:22.406 --> 00:30:32.290
So this is u, Sv, and
you still have the star.

00:30:32.290 --> 00:30:37.680
And now reverse this by
eliminating the star,

00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:45.050
so you have S--
I'm sorry, I have

00:30:45.050 --> 00:30:46.640
this notation completely wrong.

00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:50.600
Sv-- this is u.

00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:52.960
The u's v's are easily confused.

00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:57.630
So this is v, and this is u.

00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:08.260
I move the S, and then finally
I have Su, v without a star.

00:31:08.260 --> 00:31:12.240
I flipped it again.

00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:19.175
So then you compare these two,
and you get the desired result.

00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:26.760
OK, so we've gone
through this thing, which

00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:30.252
is the main result
of daggers, and I

00:31:30.252 --> 00:31:31.960
would like to see if
there are questions.

00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:36.730
Anything that has been unclear
as we've gone along here?

00:31:36.730 --> 00:31:37.355
And question?

00:31:46.970 --> 00:31:48.316
OK.

00:31:48.316 --> 00:31:50.230
No questions.

00:31:50.230 --> 00:31:59.070
So let's do a simple
example, and it's good

00:31:59.070 --> 00:32:04.500
because it's useful to
practice with explicit things.

00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:05.630
So here's an example.

00:32:08.190 --> 00:32:16.290
There's a vector space V,
which is three complex numbers,

00:32:16.290 --> 00:32:19.090
three component vectors--
complex vectors.

00:32:19.090 --> 00:32:29.706
So a v is equal to v1, v2, v3--
three numbers are all the vi.

00:32:29.706 --> 00:32:32.380
Each one belongs to
the complex number.

00:32:32.380 --> 00:32:37.130
So three complex numbers makes
a vector space like this.

00:32:37.130 --> 00:32:39.210
So somebody comes
along and gives you

00:32:39.210 --> 00:32:47.400
the following linear map--
T on a vector, v1, v1, v3,

00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:48.870
gives you another vector.

00:32:48.870 --> 00:32:49.940
It's a linear map.

00:32:49.940 --> 00:32:51.740
So what is it?

00:32:51.740 --> 00:33:00.720
It's 0 times v1 plus 2v2 plus
iv3 for the first component.

00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:02.780
The first component
of the new vector-- I

00:33:02.780 --> 00:33:09.450
put the 0v1 just so you see that
it just depends on v2 and v3.

00:33:09.450 --> 00:33:15.800
The second component is
v1 minus iv2 plus 0v3.

00:33:19.500 --> 00:33:20.990
Those are not vectors.

00:33:20.990 --> 00:33:22.100
These are components.

00:33:22.100 --> 00:33:22.950
These are numbers.

00:33:22.950 --> 00:33:24.740
So this is just
a complex number.

00:33:24.740 --> 00:33:27.980
This is another complex
number, as it should be.

00:33:27.980 --> 00:33:30.090
Acting on three
complex numbers gives

00:33:30.090 --> 00:33:33.400
you, linearly, three other ones.

00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:36.350
And then the third component--
they don't have space there,

00:33:36.350 --> 00:33:43.340
so I'll put it here--
3iv1 plus v2 plus 7v3.

00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:54.090
And the question
is two questions.

00:33:54.090 --> 00:34:06.990
Find T dagger, and write
the matrix representations

00:34:06.990 --> 00:34:09.969
of T and T dagger.

00:34:09.969 --> 00:34:19.830
Write the matrices
T and T dagger

00:34:19.830 --> 00:34:23.730
using the standard basis
in which the three basis

00:34:23.730 --> 00:34:33.440
vectors are 1, 0, 0, 0, 1,
1, 0, 0, 1, 0, and 0, 0, 1.

00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:38.920
These are the three basis
vectors-- e1, e2, and e3.

00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:42.590
You know, to write the matrix
you need the basis vectors.

00:34:42.590 --> 00:34:45.300
So that's a problem.

00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:49.080
It's a good problem
in order to practice,

00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:52.739
to see that you
understand how to turn

00:34:52.739 --> 00:34:54.690
an operator into a matrix.

00:34:54.690 --> 00:34:56.639
And you don't get confused.

00:34:56.639 --> 00:34:57.540
Is it a row?

00:34:57.540 --> 00:34:58.540
Is it a column?

00:34:58.540 --> 00:35:01.340
How does it go?

00:35:01.340 --> 00:35:05.700
So let's do this.

00:35:05.700 --> 00:35:10.820
So first we're going to try to
find the rules for T dagger.

00:35:10.820 --> 00:35:14.230
So we have the following.

00:35:14.230 --> 00:35:16.130
You see, you use
the basic property.

00:35:16.130 --> 00:35:29.312
u on Tv is equal
to T dagger u on v.

00:35:29.312 --> 00:35:36.870
So let's try to compute the left
hand side, and then look at it

00:35:36.870 --> 00:35:41.640
and try to see if we could
derive the right hand side.

00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:45.350
So what is u supposed to be
a three component vector?

00:35:45.350 --> 00:35:53.360
So for that use, u
equals u1, u2, u3.

00:35:53.360 --> 00:36:00.520
OK, now implicit in all that is
that when somebody tells you--

00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:03.650
OK, you've got a three
dimensional complex vector

00:36:03.650 --> 00:36:06.610
space what is the inner product?

00:36:06.610 --> 00:36:08.800
The inner product
is complex conjugate

00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:09.880
of the first component.

00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:12.850
That's first component of the
second, plus complex conjugate

00:36:12.850 --> 00:36:16.390
of the second times
star, times star.

00:36:16.390 --> 00:36:19.770
So it's just a generalization
of the dot product,

00:36:19.770 --> 00:36:21.865
but you complex conjugate
the first entries.

00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:27.080
So what is this?

00:36:27.080 --> 00:36:30.430
I should take the complex
conjugate of the first term

00:36:30.430 --> 00:36:34.350
here-- u1-- times the first one.

00:36:34.350 --> 00:36:38.940
So I have 2v2 plus iv3.

00:36:41.570 --> 00:36:45.660
This is the left hand side,
plus the complex conjugate

00:36:45.660 --> 00:36:47.260
of the second
component-- there's

00:36:47.260 --> 00:36:56.490
the second component--
so u2 times v1 minus iv2

00:36:56.490 --> 00:36:59.380
plus-- well, 0v3--
his time I won't write

00:36:59.380 --> 00:37:07.010
it-- plus u3 bar
times the last vector,

00:37:07.010 --> 00:37:11.710
which is 3iv1 plus v2 plus 7v3.

00:37:15.460 --> 00:37:17.450
OK, that's the left hand side.

00:37:20.810 --> 00:37:24.320
I think I'm going to use
this blackboard here,

00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:26.490
because otherwise
the numbers are going

00:37:26.490 --> 00:37:29.160
to be hard to see from
one side to the other.

00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:36.235
So this information,
those two little proofs,

00:37:36.235 --> 00:37:36.985
are to be deleted.

00:37:40.150 --> 00:37:45.190
And now we have
this left hand side.

00:37:45.190 --> 00:37:49.090
Now, somehow when
you say, OK, now I'm

00:37:49.090 --> 00:37:54.940
going to try to figure out this
right hand side your head goes

00:37:54.940 --> 00:37:56.330
and looks in there
and says well,

00:37:56.330 --> 00:38:00.250
in the left hand side the
u's are sort of the ones that

00:38:00.250 --> 00:38:05.000
are alone, and the
v's are acted upon.

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:07.230
Here the v's must be alone.

00:38:07.230 --> 00:38:12.760
So what I should do
is collect along v.

00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:20.160
So let's collect along v. So
let's put "something" times v1

00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:26.150
plus "something" like v2
plus "something" like v3.

00:38:26.150 --> 00:38:31.400
And then I will know what
is the vector T star this.

00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:32.710
So let's do that.

00:38:32.710 --> 00:38:34.530
So v1, let's collect.

00:38:34.530 --> 00:38:41.750
So you get u2 bar for
this v1, and 3iu3 bar.

00:38:46.530 --> 00:39:05.220
v2 will have 2u1 bar
minus iu2 bar plus u3 bar.

00:39:11.180 --> 00:39:12.860
I think I got them right.

00:39:12.860 --> 00:39:14.430
OK.

00:39:14.430 --> 00:39:21.840
And then v3, let's collect--
iu1 bar, nothing here,

00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:28.300
and v3 7u3 bar.

00:39:28.300 --> 00:39:34.240
OK, and now I must say, OK,
this is the inner product

00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:38.320
of T dagger u times v3.

00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:46.900
So actually, T dagger on
u, which is u1, u2, u3,

00:39:46.900 --> 00:39:52.980
must be this vector with three
components for which this thing

00:39:52.980 --> 00:40:02.120
is the inner product of this
vector with the vector V.

00:40:02.120 --> 00:40:04.290
So I look at this
I say, well, what

00:40:04.290 --> 00:40:06.600
was the formula for
the inner product?

00:40:06.600 --> 00:40:10.960
Well, you complex conjugate
the first entry of this

00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:12.840
and multiply by the
first entry of that.

00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:14.900
Complex conjugate
the second entry.

00:40:14.900 --> 00:40:23.970
So here I should
put u2 minus 3iu3,

00:40:23.970 --> 00:40:25.940
because the complex
conjugate of that

00:40:25.940 --> 00:40:28.340
is that as multiplied by v1.

00:40:28.340 --> 00:40:35.675
So here I continue--
2u1 plus iu2 plus u3.

00:40:38.540 --> 00:40:43.680
And, finally,
minus iu1 plus 7u3.

00:40:46.690 --> 00:40:48.960
And that's the answer
for this operator.

00:41:00.260 --> 00:41:01.990
So the operator
is there for you.

00:41:01.990 --> 00:41:04.300
The only thing we haven't
done is the matrices.

00:41:07.870 --> 00:41:11.180
Let me do a little
piece of one, and you

00:41:11.180 --> 00:41:12.710
try to compute the rest.

00:41:12.710 --> 00:41:14.890
Make sure you understand it.

00:41:14.890 --> 00:41:22.190
So suppose you get T
on the basis vector e1.

00:41:22.190 --> 00:41:23.980
It's easier than what it looks.

00:41:23.980 --> 00:41:26.620
I'm going to have to
write some things in order

00:41:26.620 --> 00:41:28.950
to give you a few
components, but then

00:41:28.950 --> 00:41:32.450
once you get a little practice,
or you look what it means,

00:41:32.450 --> 00:41:33.670
it will become clear.

00:41:33.670 --> 00:41:35.520
So what is T on e1?

00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:40.990
Well, it's T on
the vector 1, 0, 0.

00:41:40.990 --> 00:41:45.750
T on the vector 1, 0, 0-- look
at the top formula ther3--

00:41:45.750 --> 00:41:50.870
is equal to 0, 1, and 3i.

00:41:56.710 --> 00:42:02.660
Top formula-- the v1 is
1, and all others are 0.

00:42:02.660 --> 00:42:06.995
And this is e2 plus 3ie3.

00:42:10.330 --> 00:42:14.150
So how do you read,
now, matrix elements?

00:42:14.150 --> 00:42:20.230
You remember the
formula that T on ei

00:42:20.230 --> 00:42:27.560
is supposed to be
Tkiek-- sum over k.

00:42:27.560 --> 00:42:36.770
So this thing is supposed
to be equal to T11e1

00:42:36.770 --> 00:42:41.840
plus T21e2 plus T31e3.

00:42:45.340 --> 00:42:51.350
Your sum over the first index,
T of e1, is there for that.

00:42:51.350 --> 00:42:58.280
So then I read this, and I
see that T21 is equal to 1.

00:42:58.280 --> 00:43:01.050
This is equal to 3i.

00:43:01.050 --> 00:43:03.580
And this is equal to 0.

00:43:03.580 --> 00:43:07.140
So you've got a
piece of the matrix,

00:43:07.140 --> 00:43:13.140
and the rest I will just
tell you how you see it.

00:43:13.140 --> 00:43:17.240
But you should check it.

00:43:17.240 --> 00:43:19.790
You don't have to write
that much after you

00:43:19.790 --> 00:43:23.130
have a little
practice with this.

00:43:23.130 --> 00:43:27.370
But, the matrix T--
what you've learned

00:43:27.370 --> 00:43:29.640
is that you have 0, 1, and 3i.

00:43:33.070 --> 00:43:38.890
So 0, 1, and 3i
are these numbers,

00:43:38.890 --> 00:43:42.280
in fact-- 0, 1, and 3i.

00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:43.460
And they go vertical.

00:43:43.460 --> 00:43:48.580
So 2, minus i, and 1
is the next column.

00:43:52.140 --> 00:43:56.070
2, minus i, and 1
is the next column,

00:43:56.070 --> 00:44:00.580
and the third one would be
i-- look at the v3 there.

00:44:00.580 --> 00:44:06.500
It has an i for the first entry,
a 0 for the second, and a 7.

00:44:06.500 --> 00:44:07.620
So this is the matrix.

00:44:13.790 --> 00:44:16.360
How about the matrix T dagger?

00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:23.470
Same thing-- once you've
done one, don't worry.

00:44:23.470 --> 00:44:24.370
Don't do the one.

00:44:24.370 --> 00:44:28.040
So this you look for
the first column.

00:44:28.040 --> 00:44:32.505
It's going to be a 0-- no u1
here-- a 2, and a minus i.

00:44:38.070 --> 00:44:48.390
0, 2, and a minus i, then 1,
i, and 0, minus 3i, 1, and 7.

00:44:48.390 --> 00:44:51.190
And those are it.

00:44:51.190 --> 00:44:54.150
And look how nice.

00:44:54.150 --> 00:44:58.430
The second one is in fact
the Hermitian conjugate

00:44:58.430 --> 00:44:59.120
of the other.

00:44:59.120 --> 00:45:01.890
Transpose and complex
conjugate gives it to you.

00:45:04.750 --> 00:45:09.090
So that example suggests
that that, of course,

00:45:09.090 --> 00:45:11.830
is not an accident.

00:45:11.830 --> 00:45:14.225
So what do you need
for that to happen?

00:45:16.810 --> 00:45:21.020
Nobody said that what you're
supposed to do to find T dagger

00:45:21.020 --> 00:45:23.260
is transpose some
complex conjugate,

00:45:23.260 --> 00:45:27.840
but somehow that's what you
do once you have the matrix,

00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:29.550
or at least what
it seems that you

00:45:29.550 --> 00:45:30.940
do when you have the matrix.

00:45:30.940 --> 00:45:35.040
So let's see if we can
get that more generally.

00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:37.100
So end of example.

00:45:37.100 --> 00:45:48.170
Look at T dagger u,
v is equal to u, Tv.

00:45:48.170 --> 00:45:50.230
We know this is
the key equation.

00:45:50.230 --> 00:45:53.130
Everything comes from this.

00:45:53.130 --> 00:45:56.650
Now take u and v to be
orthonormal vectors,

00:45:56.650 --> 00:46:03.930
so u equal ei, and v equal ej.

00:46:03.930 --> 00:46:05.990
And these are orthonormal.

00:46:05.990 --> 00:46:08.730
The e's are going to be
orthonormal each time

00:46:08.730 --> 00:46:12.300
we say basis vectors--
e, orthonormal.

00:46:12.300 --> 00:46:21.942
So put them here, so you
get T dagger on ei times ej

00:46:21.942 --> 00:46:25.810
is equal to ei, Tej.

00:46:29.480 --> 00:46:36.590
Now use the matrix action
on these operators.

00:46:36.590 --> 00:46:43.848
So T dagger on ei is
supposed to be T dagger kiek.

00:46:48.700 --> 00:46:52.870
The equation is something
worth knowing by heart.

00:46:52.870 --> 00:46:55.330
What is the matrix
representation?

00:46:55.330 --> 00:46:58.530
If the index of the
vector goes here,

00:46:58.530 --> 00:47:00.610
the sum index goes like that.

00:47:00.610 --> 00:47:06.910
So then you have ej here,
and here you have ei,

00:47:06.910 --> 00:47:08.345
and you have Tkjek.

00:47:33.530 --> 00:47:36.470
So now this basis orthonormal.

00:47:36.470 --> 00:47:41.570
This is a number, and
this is the basis.

00:47:41.570 --> 00:47:43.860
The number goes out.

00:47:43.860 --> 00:47:50.520
T dagger ki-- remember,
it's on the left side,

00:47:50.520 --> 00:47:53.540
so it should go out with a star.

00:47:53.540 --> 00:47:56.970
And then you have ekej.

00:47:56.970 --> 00:48:00.880
That's orthonormal,
so it's delta kej.

00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:03.910
The number here
goes out as well,

00:48:03.910 --> 00:48:06.220
and the inner product
gives delta ik.

00:48:09.360 --> 00:48:10.585
So what do we get?

00:48:14.470 --> 00:48:24.140
T dagger ji star
is equal to Tij.

00:48:29.090 --> 00:48:33.495
First, change i for j, so
it looks more familiar.

00:48:33.495 --> 00:48:39.500
So then you have T dagger
ij star is equal to Tji.

00:48:42.710 --> 00:48:46.730
And then take complex
conjugate, so that finally you

00:48:46.730 --> 00:48:53.843
have T dagger ij is
equal to Tji star.

00:48:56.860 --> 00:49:04.050
And that shows that, as long as
you have an orthonormal basis

00:49:04.050 --> 00:49:10.750
you can see the Hermitian
conjugate of the operator

00:49:10.750 --> 00:49:13.600
by taking the matrix,
and then what you usually

00:49:13.600 --> 00:49:16.730
call the Hermitian
conjugate of the matrix.

00:49:16.730 --> 00:49:20.360
But I want to
emphasize that, if you

00:49:20.360 --> 00:49:23.880
didn't have an
orthonormal basis-- if you

00:49:23.880 --> 00:49:30.640
have your operator, and you want
to calculate the dagger of it,

00:49:30.640 --> 00:49:32.600
and you find its
matrix representation.

00:49:32.600 --> 00:49:35.790
You take the Hermitian
conjugate of the matrix.

00:49:35.790 --> 00:49:41.910
It would be wrong if your basis
vectors are not orthonormal.

00:49:41.910 --> 00:49:42.880
It just fails.

00:49:42.880 --> 00:49:46.050
So what would happen if
the basis vectors are not

00:49:46.050 --> 00:49:47.390
orthonormal?

00:49:47.390 --> 00:49:57.460
Instead of having ei with
ej giving you delta iej,

00:49:57.460 --> 00:50:02.930
you have that ei with
ej is some number.

00:50:02.930 --> 00:50:07.830
And you can call it aij, or
alpha iej, or gij, I think,

00:50:07.830 --> 00:50:09.510
is maybe a better name.

00:50:09.510 --> 00:50:21.550
So if the basis is not
orthonormal, then ei with ej

00:50:21.550 --> 00:50:25.540
is some sort of gij.

00:50:28.190 --> 00:50:30.020
And then you go back here.

00:50:30.020 --> 00:50:36.970
And, instead of having deltas
here, you would have g's.

00:50:36.970 --> 00:50:48.240
So you would have the T
dagger star ki with gkj

00:50:48.240 --> 00:50:53.808
is equal to Tkj, gik.

00:50:58.380 --> 00:51:01.480
And there's no such
simple thing as saying,

00:51:01.480 --> 00:51:04.310
oh, well you just take
the matrix and complex

00:51:04.310 --> 00:51:06.260
conjugate and transpose.

00:51:06.260 --> 00:51:08.250
That's not the dagger.

00:51:08.250 --> 00:51:11.920
It's more complicated than that.

00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:15.180
If this matrix
should be invertible,

00:51:15.180 --> 00:51:17.320
you could pass this
to the other side

00:51:17.320 --> 00:51:19.590
using the inverse
of this matrix.

00:51:19.590 --> 00:51:23.450
And you can find a
formula for the dagger

00:51:23.450 --> 00:51:27.970
in terms of the g matrix, its
inverses and multiplications.

00:51:27.970 --> 00:51:29.935
So what do you learn from here?

00:51:29.935 --> 00:51:35.730
You learn a fundamental
fact, that the statement

00:51:35.730 --> 00:51:39.010
that an operator-- for
example, you have T.

00:51:39.010 --> 00:51:43.510
And you can find T
dagger as the adjoint.

00:51:43.510 --> 00:51:48.360
The adjoint operator, or the
Hermitian conjugate operator,

00:51:48.360 --> 00:51:52.420
has a basis
independent definition.

00:51:52.420 --> 00:51:56.350
It just needs that
statement that we've

00:51:56.350 --> 00:52:02.050
written many times
now, that T dagger u,

00:52:02.050 --> 00:52:06.106
v is defined via this relation.

00:52:06.106 --> 00:52:08.680
And it has nothing
to do with a basis.

00:52:08.680 --> 00:52:11.030
It's true for arbitrary vectors.

00:52:11.030 --> 00:52:14.170
Nevertheless, how you
construct T dagger,

00:52:14.170 --> 00:52:19.360
if you have a basis--
well, sometimes

00:52:19.360 --> 00:52:22.360
it's a Hermitian
conjugate matrix,

00:52:22.360 --> 00:52:25.110
if your basis is orthonormal.

00:52:25.110 --> 00:52:28.700
But that statement, that
the dagger is the Hermitian

00:52:28.700 --> 00:52:33.090
conjugate basis, is a
little basis dependent,

00:52:33.090 --> 00:52:38.030
is not a universal
fact about the adjoint.

00:52:38.030 --> 00:52:40.330
It's not always
constructed that way.

00:52:40.330 --> 00:52:44.596
And there will be examples
where you will see that.

00:52:44.596 --> 00:52:45.096
Questions?

00:52:51.806 --> 00:52:52.802
No questions?

00:53:00.290 --> 00:53:04.500
Well, let's do brackets
for a few minutes

00:53:04.500 --> 00:53:08.490
so that you see a few
properties of them.

00:53:08.490 --> 00:53:13.520
With the same language, I'll
write formulas that we've-- OK,

00:53:13.520 --> 00:53:16.190
I wrote a formula here, in fact.

00:53:16.190 --> 00:53:21.160
So for example,
this formula-- if I

00:53:21.160 --> 00:53:28.110
want to write it with bras
and kets, I would write u Tv.

00:53:28.110 --> 00:53:34.360
And I could also
write it as u T v,

00:53:34.360 --> 00:53:38.620
because remember this
means-- the bra and the ket--

00:53:38.620 --> 00:53:43.270
just says a way to make clear
that this object is a vector.

00:53:43.270 --> 00:53:47.060
But this vector is obtained
by acting T on the vector

00:53:47.060 --> 00:53:52.770
v. So it's T on the vector
v, because a vector v is just

00:53:52.770 --> 00:53:55.770
something, and when you put
it like that that's still

00:53:55.770 --> 00:54:01.850
the vector v. The kit
doesn't do much to it.

00:54:01.850 --> 00:54:03.670
It's almost like
putting an arrow,

00:54:03.670 --> 00:54:08.560
so that's why this thing is
really this thing as well.

00:54:08.560 --> 00:54:10.500
Now, on the other
hand, this thing--

00:54:10.500 --> 00:54:19.350
let's say that this is
equal to v, T dagger u star.

00:54:19.350 --> 00:54:26.295
So then you would put here
that this is v T dagger u star.

00:54:31.470 --> 00:54:35.230
So this formula is something
that most people remember

00:54:35.230 --> 00:54:39.750
in physics, written perhaps
a little differently.

00:54:39.750 --> 00:54:44.460
Change v and u so that
this left hand side now

00:54:44.460 --> 00:54:52.520
reads u T dagger v.
And it has a star,

00:54:52.520 --> 00:54:58.780
and the right hand side
would become v T u.

00:54:58.780 --> 00:55:01.170
And just complex conjugated it.

00:55:01.170 --> 00:55:16.550
So u T dagger v is equal to v
T u star-- a nice formula that

00:55:16.550 --> 00:55:22.530
says how do you get to
understand what T dagger is.

00:55:22.530 --> 00:55:25.870
Well, if you know
T dagger's value

00:55:25.870 --> 00:55:29.014
in between any set
of states, then you

00:55:29.014 --> 00:55:34.300
know-- well, if you know T
between any set of states

00:55:34.300 --> 00:55:36.400
u and v, then you
can figure out what

00:55:36.400 --> 00:55:43.100
T dagger is between any same two
states by using this formula.

00:55:43.100 --> 00:55:45.210
What you have to do
is that this thing

00:55:45.210 --> 00:55:47.230
is equal to the reverse thing.

00:55:47.230 --> 00:55:50.600
So you go from right to
left and reverse it here.

00:55:50.600 --> 00:55:54.990
So you go v, then T, then
u, and you put a star,

00:55:54.990 --> 00:55:58.595
and that gives you that object.

00:56:01.400 --> 00:56:04.380
Another thing that we've
been doing all the time when

00:56:04.380 --> 00:56:11.605
we calculate, for
example, ei, T on ej.

00:56:14.400 --> 00:56:17.900
What is this?

00:56:17.900 --> 00:56:20.050
Well, you know what this is.

00:56:20.050 --> 00:56:23.160
Let's write it like that-- ei.

00:56:23.160 --> 00:56:32.368
Now T on ej is
the matrix T kjek.

00:56:32.368 --> 00:56:39.460
If this is an orthonormal
basis, here is a delta iek.

00:56:39.460 --> 00:56:43.930
So this is nothing else but Tij.

00:56:43.930 --> 00:56:49.200
So another way of writing that
matrix element, ij, of a matrix

00:56:49.200 --> 00:56:54.840
is to put an ei, an
ej here, and a T here.

00:56:54.840 --> 00:57:07.240
So people write it like
that-- Tij is ei comma Tej.

00:57:07.240 --> 00:57:13.960
Or, in bracket language,
they put ei T ej.

00:57:21.330 --> 00:57:24.860
So I need it to be
flexible and just

00:57:24.860 --> 00:57:27.720
be able to pass from one
notation to the other,

00:57:27.720 --> 00:57:31.890
because it helps you.

00:57:31.890 --> 00:57:39.900
One of the most helpful
things in this object

00:57:39.900 --> 00:57:44.960
is to understand, for example,
in bra and ket notation, what

00:57:44.960 --> 00:57:48.070
is the following object?

00:57:48.070 --> 00:57:52.910
What is ei ei?

00:57:57.370 --> 00:58:00.950
This seems like the
wrong kind of thing,

00:58:00.950 --> 00:58:05.880
because you were supposed to
have bras acting on vectors.

00:58:05.880 --> 00:58:07.980
So this would be on
the left of that,

00:58:07.980 --> 00:58:10.000
but otherwise it
would be too trivial.

00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:13.140
If it would be on the left of
it, it would give you a number.

00:58:13.140 --> 00:58:18.920
But think of this thing as
a object that stands there.

00:58:18.920 --> 00:58:23.470
And it's repeated
endlessly, so it's summed.

00:58:23.470 --> 00:58:25.680
So what is this object?

00:58:25.680 --> 00:58:29.210
Well, this object is a
sum of things like that,

00:58:29.210 --> 00:58:41.200
so this is really e1 e1 plus e2
e2, and it goes on like that.

00:58:43.790 --> 00:58:47.310
Well, let it act on a vector.

00:58:47.310 --> 00:58:50.160
This kind of object
is an operator.

00:58:50.160 --> 00:58:52.210
Whenever you have
the bra and the ket

00:58:52.210 --> 00:58:54.930
sort of in this wrong
position-- the ket first,

00:58:54.930 --> 00:58:59.210
and the bra afterwards--
this is, in Dirac's notation,

00:58:59.210 --> 00:59:03.160
an operator, a
particular operator.

00:59:03.160 --> 00:59:06.610
And you will see in general
how it is the general operator

00:59:06.610 --> 00:59:07.660
very soon.

00:59:07.660 --> 00:59:09.140
So look at this.

00:59:09.140 --> 00:59:12.120
You have something like
that, and why do we

00:59:12.120 --> 00:59:14.210
call it an operator?

00:59:14.210 --> 00:59:16.130
We call it an operator
business if it

00:59:16.130 --> 00:59:19.355
acts on a vector--
you put a vector here,

00:59:19.355 --> 00:59:23.760
a bra-- this becomes a
number, and there's still

00:59:23.760 --> 00:59:25.310
a vector left.

00:59:25.310 --> 00:59:34.480
So this kind of structure,
acting on something like that,

00:59:34.480 --> 00:59:38.660
gives a vector, because
this thing goes in here,

00:59:38.660 --> 00:59:41.840
produces a number, and
the vector is left there.

00:59:41.840 --> 00:59:53.041
So for example, if you act with
this thing on the vector a--

00:59:53.041 --> 01:00:00.720
an arbitrary vector
a-- what do you get?

01:00:03.810 --> 01:00:07.226
Whatever this operator
is is acted on a.

01:00:07.226 --> 01:00:12.230
Well, you remember that these
thing are the components of a,

01:00:12.230 --> 01:00:13.870
and these are the basis vectors.

01:00:13.870 --> 01:00:17.795
So this is nothing else
but the vector a again.

01:00:22.710 --> 01:00:29.530
You see, you can start with
a equals some alpha i's with

01:00:29.530 --> 01:00:33.540
ei's, and then you calculate
what are the alpha i's.

01:00:33.540 --> 01:00:41.610
You put an ej a, and this ej
on that gives you alpha j.

01:00:41.610 --> 01:00:44.430
So alpha j-- these
numbers are nothing else

01:00:44.430 --> 01:00:47.190
but these things, these numbers.

01:00:47.190 --> 01:00:51.050
So here you have the
number times the vector.

01:00:51.050 --> 01:00:55.470
The only difference is that
this is like ei alpha i.

01:00:55.470 --> 01:00:58.650
The number has
been to the right.

01:00:58.650 --> 01:01:02.680
So this thing acting on any
vector is the vector itself.

01:01:02.680 --> 01:01:07.280
So this is perhaps the
most fundamental relation

01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:15.270
in bracket notation, is that
the identity operator is this.

01:01:19.664 --> 01:01:20.163
Yes.

01:01:20.163 --> 01:01:23.040
AUDIENCE: Is that just 1 e
of i, or sum over all e of i?

01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:24.475
PROFESSOR: It's sum of over all.

01:01:24.475 --> 01:01:33.568
So here implicit sum is
the sum of all up to en en.

01:01:33.568 --> 01:01:36.430
You will see, if you
take just one of them,

01:01:36.430 --> 01:01:41.050
you will get what is an
orthogonal projector.

01:01:41.050 --> 01:01:43.590
Now this allows you
to do another piece

01:01:43.590 --> 01:01:49.860
of very nice Dirac notation.

01:01:49.860 --> 01:01:52.005
So let's do that.

01:01:59.240 --> 01:02:09.610
Suppose you have an
operator T. You put a 1

01:02:09.610 --> 01:02:15.140
in front of it-- a T
and a 1 in front of it.

01:02:15.140 --> 01:02:22.070
And then you say, OK,
this 1, I'll put ei ei.

01:02:22.070 --> 01:02:31.650
Then comes the T, and then
comes the ej ej-- another 1.

01:02:35.460 --> 01:02:37.850
And then you look at
that and you suddenly

01:02:37.850 --> 01:02:40.851
see a number lying there.

01:02:40.851 --> 01:02:41.350
Why?

01:02:41.350 --> 01:02:43.165
Because this thing
is some number.

01:02:45.790 --> 01:02:47.901
So this is the magic
of the Dirac notation.

01:02:47.901 --> 01:02:49.650
You write all this
thing, and suddenly you

01:02:49.650 --> 01:02:53.750
see numbers have been
created in between.

01:02:53.750 --> 01:02:59.770
This number is nothing else
but this matrix representation

01:02:59.770 --> 01:03:01.140
of the operator.

01:03:01.140 --> 01:03:04.550
T, between this, is Tij.

01:03:04.550 --> 01:03:12.445
So this is ei Tij ej.

01:03:16.990 --> 01:03:22.610
So this formula is
very fundamental.

01:03:22.610 --> 01:03:27.210
It shows that the most general
operator that you can ever

01:03:27.210 --> 01:03:33.770
invent is some sort
of ket before a bra,

01:03:33.770 --> 01:03:37.470
and then you superimpose
them with these numbers which

01:03:37.470 --> 01:03:43.280
actually happen to be the matrix
representation of the operator.

01:03:43.280 --> 01:03:45.860
So the operator can
be written as a sum

01:03:45.860 --> 01:03:51.180
of, if this is an n by n matrix
n squared thinks of this form--

01:03:51.180 --> 01:03:55.300
1 with 1, 1 with 2, 1
with 3, and all of them.

01:03:55.300 --> 01:03:58.340
Bu then, you know this
formula is so important

01:03:58.340 --> 01:04:00.770
that people make
sure that you realize

01:04:00.770 --> 01:04:03.420
that you're summing
over i and j.

01:04:03.420 --> 01:04:05.190
So just put it there.

01:04:08.010 --> 01:04:12.730
Given an operator, these
are its matrix elements.

01:04:12.730 --> 01:04:19.340
And this is the operator written
back in abstract notation.

01:04:19.340 --> 01:04:21.370
The whole operator is
back there for you.

01:04:24.450 --> 01:04:27.440
I want to use the last
part of the lecture

01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:35.790
to discuss a theorem that
is pretty interesting,

01:04:35.790 --> 01:04:39.230
that allows you to
understand things

01:04:39.230 --> 01:04:44.580
about all these Hermitian
operators and unitary operators

01:04:44.580 --> 01:04:46.620
much more clearly.

01:04:46.620 --> 01:04:51.400
And it's a little
mysterious, this theorem,

01:04:51.400 --> 01:04:53.720
and let's see how it goes.

01:04:58.140 --> 01:05:01.650
So any questions about this
Dirac notation at this moment,

01:05:01.650 --> 01:05:03.730
anything that I wrote there?

01:05:03.730 --> 01:05:05.720
It takes a while
to get accustomed

01:05:05.720 --> 01:05:06.940
to the Dirac notation.

01:05:06.940 --> 01:05:10.540
But once you get
the hang of it, it's

01:05:10.540 --> 01:05:13.425
sort of fun and
easy to manipulate.

01:05:16.070 --> 01:05:17.480
No questions?

01:05:17.480 --> 01:05:18.458
Can't be.

01:05:22.860 --> 01:05:24.670
You can prove all
kinds of things

01:05:24.670 --> 01:05:29.230
with this matrix
representation of the identity.

01:05:29.230 --> 01:05:32.140
For example, you
can prove easily

01:05:32.140 --> 01:05:35.420
something you proved already,
that when you multiply

01:05:35.420 --> 01:05:39.341
two operators the
matrices multiply.

01:05:39.341 --> 01:05:41.120
You can prove all
kinds of things.

01:05:41.120 --> 01:05:43.180
Pretty much
everything we've done

01:05:43.180 --> 01:05:45.530
can also be proven this way.

01:05:45.530 --> 01:05:49.500
OK, so here comes the theorem
I want to ask you about.

01:05:49.500 --> 01:05:54.870
Suppose somebody comes
along, and they tell you,

01:05:54.870 --> 01:05:59.160
well, you know,
here's a vector v,

01:05:59.160 --> 01:06:04.520
and I'm going to have a linear
operator acting on this space.

01:06:04.520 --> 01:06:07.300
So the operator's
going to be T, and I'm

01:06:07.300 --> 01:06:12.770
going act with the vector v.

01:06:12.770 --> 01:06:15.560
And moreover, I
find that this is

01:06:15.560 --> 01:06:26.150
0 for all vectors v belonging
to the vector space.

01:06:26.150 --> 01:06:30.280
And the question is-- what can
we say about this operator?

01:06:35.950 --> 01:06:39.050
From all vectors it's just 0.

01:06:39.050 --> 01:06:43.290
So is this operator 0, maybe?

01:06:43.290 --> 01:06:44.680
Does it have to be 0?

01:06:44.680 --> 01:06:46.245
Can it be something else?

01:06:48.800 --> 01:06:53.120
OK, we've been talking about
real and complex vector spaces.

01:06:53.120 --> 01:06:55.720
And we've seen that
it's different.

01:06:55.720 --> 01:06:59.000
The inner product is
a little different.

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.410
But let's think about this.

01:07:01.410 --> 01:07:05.530
Take two dimensions,
real vector space.

01:07:05.530 --> 01:07:07.760
The operator that
takes any vector

01:07:07.760 --> 01:07:11.440
and rotates it by 90 degrees,
that's a linear operator.

01:07:14.300 --> 01:07:20.570
And that is a non-trivial linear
operator, and it gives you 0.

01:07:20.570 --> 01:07:26.710
So case settled-- there's
no theorem here, nothing

01:07:26.710 --> 01:07:28.500
you can say about this operator.

01:07:28.500 --> 01:07:31.140
It may be non-zero.

01:07:31.140 --> 01:07:33.440
But here comes the catch.

01:07:33.440 --> 01:07:40.010
If you're talking complex
vector spaces, T is 0.

01:07:40.010 --> 01:07:42.350
It just is 0, can't
be anything else.

01:07:42.350 --> 01:07:44.460
Complex vector
spaces are different.

01:07:44.460 --> 01:07:48.540
You can't quite do that thing--
rotate all vectors by something

01:07:48.540 --> 01:07:50.420
and do things.

01:07:50.420 --> 01:07:53.020
So that's a theorem
we want to understand.

01:07:53.020 --> 01:08:05.830
Theorem-- let v be a
complex inner product space.

01:08:10.270 --> 01:08:13.810
By that is a complex vector
space with an inner product.

01:08:13.810 --> 01:08:25.890
Then v, Tv equals
0 for all v implies

01:08:25.890 --> 01:08:28.170
that the operator is just 0.

01:08:35.580 --> 01:08:39.930
I traced a lot of my
confusions in quantum mechanics

01:08:39.930 --> 01:08:42.390
to not knowing
about this theorem,

01:08:42.390 --> 01:08:46.109
that somehow it must be true.

01:08:46.109 --> 01:08:48.520
I don't know why
it should be true,

01:08:48.520 --> 01:08:56.250
but somehow it's not, because
it really has exceptions.

01:08:56.250 --> 01:08:57.300
So here it is.

01:08:57.300 --> 01:09:01.340
We tried to prove that.

01:09:01.340 --> 01:09:05.060
It's so important, I think,
that it should be proven.

01:09:05.060 --> 01:09:08.590
And how could you prove that?

01:09:08.590 --> 01:09:12.330
And at first sight it seems
it's going to be difficult,

01:09:12.330 --> 01:09:16.490
because, if I do
just a formal proof,

01:09:16.490 --> 01:09:18.760
how is it going to
know that I'm not

01:09:18.760 --> 01:09:21.069
talking real or
complex vector spaces.

01:09:21.069 --> 01:09:24.430
So it must make a crucial
difference in the proof

01:09:24.430 --> 01:09:27.359
whether it's real or complex.

01:09:27.359 --> 01:09:31.939
So this property really sets
the complex vector spaces

01:09:31.939 --> 01:09:33.970
quite apart from the real ones.

01:09:33.970 --> 01:09:38.899
So let's see what
you would need to do.

01:09:38.899 --> 01:10:01.630
Well, here's a strategy--
if I could prove that u,

01:10:01.630 --> 01:10:10.800
Tv is equal to 0 for all
u and all v. You see,

01:10:10.800 --> 01:10:14.010
the problem here is that
these two are the same vector.

01:10:14.010 --> 01:10:17.320
They're all vectors, but
they're the same vector.

01:10:17.320 --> 01:10:23.230
If I could prove that this
is 0 for all u and v, then

01:10:23.230 --> 01:10:24.380
what would I say?

01:10:24.380 --> 01:10:27.900
I would say, oh, if this
is 0 for all u and v,

01:10:27.900 --> 01:10:34.040
then pick u equal to Tv.

01:10:34.040 --> 01:10:39.410
And then you find
that Tv, Tv is 0,

01:10:39.410 --> 01:10:43.600
therefore Tv is the 0 vector.

01:10:43.600 --> 01:10:45.660
By the axiom of
the inner product,

01:10:45.660 --> 01:10:50.580
for all v is a 0 vector,
so T kills all vectors,

01:10:50.580 --> 01:10:53.630
therefore T is 0.

01:10:53.630 --> 01:11:00.060
So if I could prove this
is true, I would be done.

01:11:03.150 --> 01:11:05.510
Now, of course,
that's the difficulty.

01:11:05.510 --> 01:11:09.470
Well, I wouldn't say of course.

01:11:09.470 --> 01:11:13.120
This takes a leap
of faith to believe

01:11:13.120 --> 01:11:16.060
that this is the way
you're going to prove that.

01:11:16.060 --> 01:11:20.050
You could try to prove this,
and then it would follow.

01:11:20.050 --> 01:11:21.890
But maybe that's
difficult to prove.

01:11:21.890 --> 01:11:24.490
But actually that's
possible to prove.

01:11:24.490 --> 01:11:28.780
But how could you ever
prove that this is true?

01:11:28.780 --> 01:11:31.690
You could prove it
if you could somehow

01:11:31.690 --> 01:11:40.626
rewrite u and Tv as some
sort of something with a T

01:11:40.626 --> 01:11:47.530
and something plus some
other thing with a T,

01:11:47.530 --> 01:11:52.450
and that other thing plus some--
all kinds of things like that.

01:11:52.450 --> 01:11:57.100
Because the things in which
this is the same as that are 0.

01:11:59.710 --> 01:12:03.660
So if you can do that-- if you
could re-express this left hand

01:12:03.660 --> 01:12:07.840
side as a sum of things of
that kind-- that would be 0.

01:12:07.840 --> 01:12:11.700
So let's try.

01:12:11.700 --> 01:12:13.840
So what can you try?

01:12:13.840 --> 01:12:20.490
You can put u plus v here,
and T of u plus v. That

01:12:20.490 --> 01:12:25.290
would be 0, because that's
a vector, same vector here.

01:12:25.290 --> 01:12:29.450
But that's not equal to this,
because it has the u, Tu,

01:12:29.450 --> 01:12:31.650
and it has the v Tv.

01:12:31.650 --> 01:12:34.130
And it has this in
a different order.

01:12:34.130 --> 01:12:49.500
So maybe we can subtract u
minus v, T of u minus v. Well,

01:12:49.500 --> 01:12:52.400
we're getting
there, but all this

01:12:52.400 --> 01:12:59.570
is question marks-- u, Tu, v,
Tv-- these cancel-- u, Tu, v,

01:12:59.570 --> 01:13:01.460
Tv.

01:13:01.460 --> 01:13:04.410
But, the cross-products,
what are they?

01:13:04.410 --> 01:13:06.114
Well here you have a u, Tv.

01:13:08.904 --> 01:13:13.210
And here you have a v, Tu.

01:13:13.210 --> 01:13:16.660
And do they cancel?

01:13:16.660 --> 01:13:17.630
No.

01:13:17.630 --> 01:13:18.540
Let's see.

01:13:18.540 --> 01:13:22.160
u, Tv, and up here
is u minus Tv about.

01:13:22.160 --> 01:13:25.000
But there's another minus,
so there's another one there.

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:28.050
And v, Tu has a minus,
minus is a plus.

01:13:28.050 --> 01:13:32.010
So actually this gives me
two of this plus two of that.

01:13:32.010 --> 01:13:34.290
OK, it shouldn't have
been so easy anyway.

01:13:40.090 --> 01:13:43.673
So here is where you have to
have the small inspiration.

01:13:48.070 --> 01:13:50.170
Somehow it shouldn't
have worked, you know.

01:13:50.170 --> 01:13:53.860
If this had worked, the
theorem would read different.

01:13:53.860 --> 01:13:57.240
You could use a
real vector space.

01:13:57.240 --> 01:13:59.900
Nothing is imaginary there.

01:13:59.900 --> 01:14:02.600
So the fact that you have
a complex vector space

01:14:02.600 --> 01:14:03.290
might help.

01:14:03.290 --> 01:14:06.150
So somehow you have
to put i's there.

01:14:06.150 --> 01:14:08.260
So let's try i's here.

01:14:08.260 --> 01:14:16.000
So you put u plus iv
and T of u plus iv.

01:14:19.090 --> 01:14:23.380
Well, then you probably have
to subtract things as well, so

01:14:23.380 --> 01:14:29.740
u minus iv, T of u minus iv.

01:14:29.740 --> 01:14:34.030
These things will be 0 because
of the general structure--

01:14:34.030 --> 01:14:38.020
the same operator here as here.

01:14:38.020 --> 01:14:39.620
And let's see what they are.

01:14:39.620 --> 01:14:43.700
Well, there's u, Tu,
and here's minus u, Tu,

01:14:43.700 --> 01:14:49.480
so the diagonal things go away--
the minus iv, minus iv, iv,

01:14:49.480 --> 01:14:53.940
and a T. You have minus
iv, minus iv subtracted,

01:14:53.940 --> 01:14:55.800
so that also cancels.

01:14:55.800 --> 01:14:58.790
So there's the cross-products.

01:14:58.790 --> 01:15:05.790
Now you will say, well,
just like the minus signs,

01:15:05.790 --> 01:15:09.050
you're not going to get
anything because you're

01:15:09.050 --> 01:15:10.300
going to get 2 and 2.

01:15:10.300 --> 01:15:13.492
Let's see.

01:15:13.492 --> 01:15:15.640
Let's see what we
get with this one.

01:15:15.640 --> 01:15:23.090
You get u with Tiv,
so you get i u, Tv.

01:15:26.930 --> 01:15:32.870
But look, this i on the left,
however, when you take it out,

01:15:32.870 --> 01:15:41.440
becomes a minus i, so
you get minus i v, Tu.

01:15:46.780 --> 01:15:49.490
And the other
products [INAUDIBLE].

01:15:49.490 --> 01:15:56.050
So let's look what you get
here-- a u with a minus iv

01:15:56.050 --> 01:16:00.366
and a minus here
gives you a 2 here.

01:16:00.366 --> 01:16:03.450
And the other
term, v, Tu-- well,

01:16:03.450 --> 01:16:06.570
this goes out as a plus i.

01:16:06.570 --> 01:16:11.020
But with a minus, it becomes
a minus i, so v, Tu is this.

01:16:11.020 --> 01:16:12.185
So there's a 2 here.

01:16:17.850 --> 01:16:21.500
So that's what these
terms give you.

01:16:21.500 --> 01:16:23.700
And now you've succeeded.

01:16:23.700 --> 01:16:24.220
Why?

01:16:24.220 --> 01:16:27.110
Because the relative
sign is negative.

01:16:27.110 --> 01:16:28.830
So who cares?

01:16:28.830 --> 01:16:32.370
You can divide by i,
and divide this by i.

01:16:32.370 --> 01:16:34.270
You are constructing something.

01:16:34.270 --> 01:16:37.070
So let me put here what you get.

01:16:42.230 --> 01:16:43.695
I can erase this blackboard.

01:16:50.020 --> 01:16:51.285
So what do we get?

01:16:55.860 --> 01:17:03.280
I claim that if you put
one quarter of u plus v,

01:17:03.280 --> 01:17:15.230
T u plus v minus u minus
v, T of u minus v, then,

01:17:15.230 --> 01:17:17.680
let's see, what do
we need to keep?

01:17:17.680 --> 01:17:21.450
We need to keep u and Tv.

01:17:21.450 --> 01:17:27.250
So divide this by
i plus 1 over i

01:17:27.250 --> 01:17:36.400
u plus iv, T of
u plus iv minus 1

01:17:36.400 --> 01:17:42.730
over i, u minus iv,
T of u minus iv.

01:17:46.027 --> 01:17:47.490
And close it.

01:17:50.700 --> 01:17:52.550
You've divided by i.

01:17:52.550 --> 01:17:57.180
You get here four of these
ones, zero of these ones,

01:17:57.180 --> 01:18:00.820
and you got the
answer you wanted.

01:18:00.820 --> 01:18:04.180
So this whole thing
is written like that,

01:18:04.180 --> 01:18:11.270
and now, since this
is equal to u with Tv,

01:18:11.270 --> 01:18:14.170
by the conditions
of the theorem,

01:18:14.170 --> 01:18:20.500
any vector-- any vector
here-- these are all 0.

01:18:20.500 --> 01:18:26.000
You've shown that this is 0,
and therefore the operator is 0.

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.030
And you should be
very satisfied,

01:18:28.030 --> 01:18:30.940
because the proof
made use of the fact

01:18:30.940 --> 01:18:32.840
that it was a
complex vector space.

01:18:32.840 --> 01:18:36.790
Otherwise you could
not add vectors

01:18:36.790 --> 01:18:38.250
with an imaginary number.

01:18:38.250 --> 01:18:41.880
And the imaginary
number made it all work.

01:18:41.880 --> 01:18:45.010
So the theorem is there.

01:18:45.010 --> 01:18:48.370
It's a pretty useful
theorem, so let's use it

01:18:48.370 --> 01:18:50.940
for the most
obvious application.

01:18:54.890 --> 01:19:01.170
People say that,
whenever you find that v,

01:19:01.170 --> 01:19:13.210
Tv is real for all
v, then this operator

01:19:13.210 --> 01:19:16.050
is Hermitian, or self-adjoint.

01:19:16.050 --> 01:19:23.800
That is, then, it implies
T dagger equals T.

01:19:23.800 --> 01:19:25.950
So let's show that.

01:19:28.590 --> 01:19:32.620
So let's take v, Tv.

01:19:36.730 --> 01:19:38.962
Proof.

01:19:38.962 --> 01:19:48.180
You take v, Tv, and
now this thing is real.

01:19:48.180 --> 01:19:55.795
So since this is real, you can
say it's equal to v, Tv star.

01:19:59.270 --> 01:20:02.750
Now, because it's real--
that's the assumption.

01:20:02.750 --> 01:20:03.990
The number is real.

01:20:03.990 --> 01:20:16.520
Now, the star off an
inner product is Tv, v.

01:20:16.520 --> 01:20:19.530
But on the other
hand, this operator,

01:20:19.530 --> 01:20:24.820
by the definition of
adjoint, can be moved here.

01:20:24.820 --> 01:20:30.120
And this is equal
to T dagger v, v. So

01:20:30.120 --> 01:20:34.530
now you have done
this is equal to this.

01:20:34.530 --> 01:20:37.090
So if you put it
to one side, you

01:20:37.090 --> 01:20:46.510
get that T dagger minus T
on v times v is equal to 0.

01:20:46.510 --> 01:20:53.560
Or, since any inner
product that is 00--

01:20:53.560 --> 01:20:59.140
it's complex conjugate is
0-- you can write it as v,

01:20:59.140 --> 01:21:08.180
T dagger minus v is 0 for all v.

01:21:08.180 --> 01:21:11.430
And so this is an actually
well known statement,

01:21:11.430 --> 01:21:17.460
that any operator that gives you
real things must be Hermitian.

01:21:17.460 --> 01:21:23.110
But it's not obvious, because
that theorem is not obvious.

01:21:23.110 --> 01:21:26.660
And now you can use a
theorem and say, well,

01:21:26.660 --> 01:21:31.910
since this is true for all
v, T dagger minus T is 0,

01:21:31.910 --> 01:21:37.010
and T dagger is equal to T. Then
you can also show, of course,

01:21:37.010 --> 01:21:41.730
if T dagger is equal to
T, this thing is real.

01:21:41.730 --> 01:21:47.100
So in fact, this
arrow is both ways.

01:21:47.100 --> 01:21:53.320
And this way is very easy, but
this way uses this theorem.

01:21:53.320 --> 01:21:56.445
There's another
kind of operators

01:21:56.445 --> 01:21:58.630
that are called
unitary operators.

01:21:58.630 --> 01:22:01.060
We'll talk a little more
about them next time.

01:22:01.060 --> 01:22:04.940
And they preserve
the norm of vectors.

01:22:04.940 --> 01:22:06.480
People define them
from you, and you

01:22:06.480 --> 01:22:09.080
see that they preserve
the norm of vectors.

01:22:09.080 --> 01:22:11.375
On the other hand, you
sometimes find an operator

01:22:11.375 --> 01:22:14.460
that preserves every norm.

01:22:14.460 --> 01:22:16.200
Is it unitary?

01:22:16.200 --> 01:22:17.667
You will say, yes, must be.

01:22:17.667 --> 01:22:18.500
How do you prove it?

01:22:18.500 --> 01:22:20.550
You need again that theorem.

01:22:20.550 --> 01:22:23.120
So this theorem is
really quite fundamental

01:22:23.120 --> 01:22:25.950
to understand the
properties of operators.

01:22:25.950 --> 01:22:27.750
And we'll continue
that next time.

01:22:27.750 --> 01:22:29.600
All right.

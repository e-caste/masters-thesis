YEN-JIE LEE: Before people
take 8.03 class, especially

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.810
my version, most
of the students may

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:18.930
think uncertainty principle
is actually completely related

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.980
to quantum mechanics.

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.520
So actually it is
actually not the case.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.180
Actually, uncertainty
principle almost have nothing

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.770
to do with quantum mechanics.

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:35.370
It has to do with just the
wave description we employ

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.680
when we describe the system.

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.390
So that's actually
one of the big thing

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.960
which you will learn from 8.03.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.420
The other thing which
people will learn a lot more

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.780
is actually that before
they come into the class,

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.450
they may think it's almost
impossible to understand

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.300
infinitely number of
coupled oscillators.

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.280
And it turns out that there
is a very systematical way

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.500
you can actually make use
of simple symmetry argument,

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.410
and that you can
actually greatly simplify

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:18.000
complicated system, like
infinity long system.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.870
So it is actually not
an impossible task,

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:23.600
and then everything can
be actually understand,

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:29.270
using the concept of symmetry,
which we introduce in 8.03.

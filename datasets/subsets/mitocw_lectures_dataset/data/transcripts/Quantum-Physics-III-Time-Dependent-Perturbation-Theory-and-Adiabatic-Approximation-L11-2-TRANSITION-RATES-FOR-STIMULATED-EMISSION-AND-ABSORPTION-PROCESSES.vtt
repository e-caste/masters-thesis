WEBVTT

00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.230
PROFESSOR: OK, so
we're good to consider,

00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:03.960
therefore, the two cases.

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:08.109
So let's consider
the first case,

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:10.420
that this can be
pretty important,

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:19.380
this case one, when omega
fi plus omega is nearly 0.

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.560
In this case, what's happening?

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:32.340
You have Ef minus Ei plus
h bar omega is nearly 0,

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:41.700
or Ef roughly equal to
Ei minus h bar omega.

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.900
So what has happened if you have
a number-- so the question is,

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:51.540
when this happens, which
means that your omega--

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.550
that is, your perturbation--

00:00:53.550 --> 00:01:00.000
is tailored to produce this,
then Ef is Ei minus h omega.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.450
So you can think of
the energy scale here.

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:06.200
And Ef is lower than Ei.

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.340
And the difference
is h bar omega.

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:13.780
So what is this process?

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:21.760
This process is called
stimulated emission.

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.000
And why is that called
stimulated emission?

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.830
Because you're going
from a state of energy Ei

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:33.790
to a state of energy Ef
that has lower energy.

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:40.270
In that process, you're
releasing energy h bar omega

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.780
to the perturbation.

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:49.350
So it's almost--
you would say it's

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.660
stimulated because the
perturbation did it.

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.750
Still, it almost seems
like something the system

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.480
would do by itself.

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:59.770
It has higher energy.

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.330
It can go to lower energy and
emit something with frequency

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.430
with energy h omega.

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:10.180
But it does that only because
there is a perturbation.

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:15.050
If there was no perturbation,
this would not happen.

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.130
That's why, say if you consider
a hydrogen atom or a system,

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.720
it's not that the electron
that is in a higher state just

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.020
jumps by itself down.

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.230
It jumps by itself out
because it can couple

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:30.910
to other degrees of freedom.

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.090
And in particular, it can couple
to an electromagnetic field

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.450
and send out the photon.

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:41.650
So here, you have stimulated
emission of energy h bar omega.

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:47.680
So stimulated
emission-- emission.

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:00.630
And then the other term
corresponds to the case

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:08.450
when omega fi minus omega
is equal to 0, in which case

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:14.610
Ef is equal Ei plus h bar omega.

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:23.460
This time, Ef is higher
than Ei h bar omega.

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:25.890
And this process is
called absorption--

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:29.750
absorption.

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:39.900
You absorb energy h bar
omega from the perturbation.

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:46.790
The perturbation is capable of
giving the system energy h bar

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:53.720
omega to enable a transition
between Ei and Ef.

00:03:53.720 --> 00:04:00.600
So this harmonic perturbation
has two tricks up its sleeve.

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:05.900
It can push you up
by giving you energy,

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:10.520
or it can stimulate you
to go to a lower state

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:14.060
and give energy to
the system represented

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.670
by the perturbation.

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:21.230
So two good things it
can do, and both cases

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:22.440
are pretty important.

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:26.190
So we're going to develop
one of these cases.

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:28.670
The other one has exactly
the same formulas.

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:32.790
And we need the Fermi golden
rule for this situation.

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:35.510
So that's what
I'll do right now.

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:39.680
To fix our notation, let's
just do the case of absorption.

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:46.190
But both are going to be
taken care simultaneously.

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:54.980
So absorption-- so what is C?

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:59.210
So when you're doing
absorption, you're saying, OK.

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:03.510
I'm basically having
this process in which Ef

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:07.730
is related to Ei in this way.

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:12.040
This term is becoming 0.

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:14.310
And this term is negligible.

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:18.822
So you can completely
ignore one term

00:05:18.822 --> 00:05:20.030
when you're doing absorption.

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:22.010
And you can ignore
the other term

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:24.770
when you're doing a
stimulated emission.

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:27.080
You would say, oh,
but it's not exact.

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:28.540
What about if I keep it?

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:33.140
Well, there are many things
that we don't do exact.

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:37.520
This term is much
bigger than the other--

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.680
in principle,
infinitely bigger--

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.430
because we're going
to be integrated

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:43.360
over a narrow set of states.

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:47.270
So it would make no sense
to keep those other things.

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:50.720
Those other terms would
be much smaller, probably,

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:53.970
at even the next order
of perturbation theory.

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:59.040
So we keep, therefore,
the second term.

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:01.110
And so what do we have?

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:13.130
Cf of t naught 1 minus
H fi prime over h bar, e

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:21.800
to the i omega fi
minus omega t over 2.

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:24.240
You don't see that
term, of course.

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:29.030
But I'm going to take
out half of this phase

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:33.880
so that I get a sine
function out here.

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:35.700
So I took out half of the phase.

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:44.910
And then I get 2i sine omega
fi minus omega t over 2.

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:52.140
OK, that's this thing.

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:56.870
So the probability to go
from initial to final state

00:06:56.870 --> 00:07:07.580
at time t naught would be
the C f1 of t naught squared.

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:18.590
And that's 4H fi prime,
because of the two here.

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:24.660
It's 4H fi prime
squared over h squared

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:34.130
sine squared of omega fi
minus omega over 2 times time

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:40.260
over omega fi minus
omega squared.

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:50.320
And this is all for Ef roughly
equal to Ei plus h bar omega.

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:51.760
So I didn't do much.

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:55.270
I really didn't do
all that much so far.

00:07:55.270 --> 00:08:00.370
I just took the second term,
rewrote it with a sine,

00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:02.410
and calculated its norm squared.

00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:06.340
That's the probability to go
from initial to final states.

00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:20.160
So the last step is
integrating over a final state.

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:24.960
So you have this sum over final
states of this probability

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:27.960
to go to the final state.

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:32.730
And we'll write it as the
integral over the set of states

00:08:32.730 --> 00:08:39.840
rho of e final dE
final probability

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:44.505
final to initial of t naught.

00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:50.940
And this is the same calculation
we were doing before.

00:08:54.040 --> 00:09:02.130
And for this calculation, we
just substitute what P fi is.

00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:06.480
We assume that as
we integrate, we're

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:11.280
going to have a narrow range
so that this function, rho

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:17.630
of Ef and h prime fi can
go out of the integral.

00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:19.465
So what are we going to have?

00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:24.050
I'll write it here.

00:09:24.050 --> 00:09:30.790
4-- from the matrix
element, from this thing--

00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:35.240
H fi prime squared
over h squared.

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:42.430
That goes out.

00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:45.020
Then the rho of Ef goes out.

00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:48.840
So I'll write it rho of Ef.

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:51.070
And rather than
leaving it like Ef,

00:09:51.070 --> 00:09:56.040
like that, because it seems
like a variable, still,

00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:58.050
of integration--
if I take it out,

00:09:58.050 --> 00:10:00.900
I should be explicit
what this Ef is.

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:03.015
And in this case, Ef--

00:10:03.015 --> 00:10:04.720
we're doing absorption.

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:10.590
So this is equal to
Ei plus h bar omega.

00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:13.290
That's this central
contribution.

00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:16.440
And that's where
you're taking rho out.

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:20.790
So this is pretty important.

00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:24.840
This rho is evaluated
at the final energy,

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:31.560
which in this process is
h omega in addition to Ei.

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:37.185
And then the rest of
the integral dE f--

00:10:37.185 --> 00:10:40.500
you still have dE f--
and the sine function.

00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:49.500
So sine squared of omega
fi minus omega t over--

00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:50.780
t naught, I'm sorry.

00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:54.150
I'm missing t naught everywhere.

00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:56.770
But I did copy it.

00:10:56.770 --> 00:10:58.890
t naught and t
naught's up there.

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:10.150
Over 2 over omega fi
minus omega squared.

00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:14.270
And this is the
story of the lobes.

00:11:14.270 --> 00:11:20.410
This is the function that has
the lobes as a function of Ef.

00:11:20.410 --> 00:11:23.020
As a function of
Ef, this quantity

00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:26.440
varies and starts
developing the lobes.

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:33.620
And the lobes happen
for values of Ef

00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:38.310
that are separated by some
h bar divided by t naught.

00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:41.970
So this is the
exact same integral

00:11:41.970 --> 00:11:45.480
we analyzed for the
constant transitions.

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:47.400
And it is the same
integral that we

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:53.370
argued that could be done as a
sine squared x over x squared.

00:11:53.370 --> 00:11:56.770
So I will not do it again.

00:11:56.770 --> 00:12:02.440
This integral gives h bar
linear in t naught over 2 pi.

00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:08.190
When you study this,
you will have the notes

00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:09.570
and you can review it.

00:12:09.570 --> 00:12:11.850
If you've taken
notes, you will see

00:12:11.850 --> 00:12:14.460
that is exactly
the same integral

00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:20.850
we had last time, except that
we didn't have the omega, which

00:12:20.850 --> 00:12:22.650
really doesn't change things.

00:12:22.650 --> 00:12:25.680
It just shifts the zero.

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:28.920
So the peak of this
contribution is when

00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:31.620
omega fi is equal to omega.

00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:36.930
Before when we did it was
when omega fi was equal to 0.

00:12:36.930 --> 00:12:39.690
That's why, in the
constant transitions

00:12:39.690 --> 00:12:42.780
you conserved energy.

00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:49.950
So with this result in
there, the whole answer

00:12:49.950 --> 00:12:53.235
here is 2 pi over h bar--

00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:04.050
h bar only because one
h bar cancels, indeed--

00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:16.690
rho at Ef equal Ei
plus h omega H fi prime

00:13:16.690 --> 00:13:19.840
squared times t naught.

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:26.300
That's all that is left,
which is great because that

00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:29.270
is our Fermi's golden rule.

00:13:29.270 --> 00:13:32.510
Remember, that's a
transition probability.

00:13:32.510 --> 00:13:36.350
And the rate is obtained
by dividing this

00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:41.150
by the time that has elapsed to
find the probability per unit

00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:41.930
time.

00:13:41.930 --> 00:13:44.550
That's the rate.

00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:47.330
It's probability for
transition per unit,

00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:58.970
times 2 pi over h bar rho
at Ef equal Ei plus h bar

00:13:58.970 --> 00:14:10.670
omega times the matrix element
f H prime initial squared.

00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:16.490
That's Fermi's golden rule
for harmonic transitions,

00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:19.700
and in particular,
for absorption.

00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:24.650
But stimulated emission,
the calculation

00:14:24.650 --> 00:14:26.720
is completely analogous.

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:32.300
So the end result for stimulated
emission is just minus H omega.

00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:35.850
The final energy
now is this one.

00:14:35.850 --> 00:14:38.150
So the top sine--

00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:46.630
plus is for absorption, minus
for stimulated emission.

00:14:56.490 --> 00:14:59.910
And if you want a
reminder here, it

00:14:59.910 --> 00:15:10.350
was that delta H was 2H
prime cosine omega t.

00:15:10.350 --> 00:15:16.710
So this reminds you that
this H prime you have here

00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:19.620
is the matrix element
of the perturbation

00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:20.820
with this convention.

00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:23.670
This omega you have
here is the frequency

00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:26.040
of the perturbing Hamiltonian.

00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:27.510
And that's what has happened.

00:15:30.810 --> 00:15:34.920
So this is Fermi's golden rule.

00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:35.610
It's over.

00:15:35.610 --> 00:15:40.050
We've done it, done it
basically for two cases--

00:15:40.050 --> 00:15:44.010
the constant perturbation and
the harmonic perturbation.

00:15:44.010 --> 00:15:45.640
And there's a lot
of physics here

00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:51.750
that we will be exploring
starting now, but continuing

00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:58.260
with atoms and radiation in
general, atomic transitions.

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:00.870
W is the rate.

00:16:00.870 --> 00:16:05.484
So this is called the
transition rate per unit time--

00:16:05.484 --> 00:16:14.290
transition rate per unit time.

00:16:14.290 --> 00:16:18.940
So the probability of
transition or probability

00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:23.060
of transition per unit time--

00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:30.130
probability of transition
per unit time--

00:16:33.510 --> 00:16:36.060
that's probably more
understandable than the word

00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:37.260
rate.

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:43.020
So this P fi gives you the
probability of transition

00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:46.200
after a time t naught.

00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:48.570
Happily, it's
proportional to t naught,

00:16:48.570 --> 00:16:52.020
so you divide by the
time that has elapsed,

00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:55.710
and it's a probability of
transition per unit time.

00:16:55.710 --> 00:16:58.290
So once you compute
this number, you

00:16:58.290 --> 00:17:01.770
get the probability of
transition per unit time.

00:17:01.770 --> 00:17:06.150
So if this W is something
and you have a billion atoms,

00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:09.500
you multiply that probability
by the number of atoms you have,

00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:12.590
and you know how many
have decayed already.

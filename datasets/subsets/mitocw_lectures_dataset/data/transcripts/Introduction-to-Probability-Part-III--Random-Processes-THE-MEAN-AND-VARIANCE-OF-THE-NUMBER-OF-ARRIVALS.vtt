00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:04.135
Now that we have in
our hands the PMF

00:00:04.135 --> 00:00:08.320
of the random variable N tau,
which is the number of arrivals

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.500
during an interval
of length tau,

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.700
we can go ahead and
try to calculate

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.540
the mean and variance
of this quantity.

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.630
Regarding the mean, we could
use just the definition

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.300
of the expected value
and then carry out

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.470
of this calculation,
which is not too hard.

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.510
And in the end, we would obtain
an answer equal to lambda times

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:29.660
tau.

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.250
This is indeed the correct
formula for the expected value.

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.620
But let us understand
why this formula should

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.900
be true without doing
any calculation.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:44.010
Remember that the random
variable, the number

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.790
of arrivals in the
Poisson process,

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.850
is well approximated by a
binomial random variable

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.210
with those particular
parameters n and p in the limit

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.390
when delta goes to zero.

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.580
And this works through a
discretization argument.

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:04.450
Therefore, the
expected value of N tau

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:07.870
should be approximately equal
to the expected value of that we

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:10.400
get from the Bernoulli
processes, that is the expected

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.550
value of the binomial
random variable.

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.130
And the expected value of
a binomial random variable

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.120
is n times p.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:22.810
And n times p evaluates
approximately to lambda times

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:23.690
tau.

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:27.560
The second equality here is
approximate because we're

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.610
neglecting this order
of delta squared term.

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.860
Now, these approximations
are increasingly

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.310
exact as we let delta go to 0.

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.039
And when we take the
limit as delta goes to 0,

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:42.330
we see that the expected value
of the number of arrivals

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.200
in the Poisson process will
be equal to lambda tau.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.200
For the variance, we can
follow a similar argument.

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.009
First do a binomial
approximation

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:56.870
and use the formula
for the variance

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:59.600
of a binomial random variable.

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.390
And then, when delta is
small, this number p is small.

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.610
And it's negligible
compared to 1.

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.389
n times p is approximately
lambda [tau].

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:13.400
And so we obtain this expression

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.240
This expression here
is the correct one.

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.920
If we were to use the formal
definition of the variance

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.920
and carry out the
calculations using the PMF,

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.000
this is what we would
obtain, except that it

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.600
would be somewhat tedious.

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.630
The formulas that
we have derived,

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.200
at least the first
one, is quite intuitive

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.170
and has a natural form.

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.220
The expected number of arrivals
is proportional to tau.

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.940
If we double the length of the
time interval for interest,

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.300
we expect to see twice
as many arrivals.

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.210
This formula also reinforces
the interpretation of lambda

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:51.140
as an arrival rate.

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.590
Since lambda is the expected
number of arrivals divided

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.870
by the length of
time, it is, really,

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.000
the expected number of
arrivals per unit time.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.350
So it's natural to call
lambda the arrival rate,

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.750
or the intensity of
the arrival process.

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.430
Finally, regarding the
variance, it is a curious fact

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.150
that the variance
turns out to be

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.850
exactly the same as
the expected value.

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:21.660
And this is a special
property of the Poisson PMF.

GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: OK.

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:27.480
So I don't know if everybody's
awake, but I will start.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:41.000
So today, the topic is
actually Hamiltonian optics,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.720
but we had some leftover
from last time, leakage.

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.570
So I'd like to go through
that very briefly.

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.510
And then I will handover
to Se Baek and Pepe,

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.540
who will give a
demonstration of aberrations

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.240
in sort of experimental
demonstration,

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:04.090
and also how optical
design software works.

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:05.840
And then we'll get
into Hamiltonian optics

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.880
the second hour, and
we'll see how far we go.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:09.380
OK.

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.500
So last time we talked
about how many aberrations?

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.293
We talked about spherical,
coma, that's about it.

00:01:17.293 --> 00:01:19.210
So we talked, actually,
about two aberrations.

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:21.700
And we said that there
is five of them--

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.230
the five so-called Seidel
aberrations or side order

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:27.460
aberrations.

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.570
And today, I'll cover
the other three.

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:36.600
So the first one in
line is astigmatism,

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.780
which is actually--

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.240
for me, at least, it is the
most difficult to visualize.

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:49.290
The best schematic I have seen
actually is in your textbook.

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.300
It's the middle
picture over here.

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.040
But before we get to that
and we see what happens

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:00.810
is, let's define to make sure
that we know the terminology.

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:07.500
So astigmatism happens--
look at the top left diagram.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.759
Astigmatism happens
with an object point

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:14.130
that is off center.

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.700
And since it is off center,
imagine that there's

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.440
a fundamental asymmetry.

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.990
If you take the chief ray
that goes through the center

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.890
of the lens--

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.860
and again, here the assumption
is that the aperture

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.720
is at the lens itself.

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.010
So the chief ray goes to
the center of the lens.

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.150
So now you can
take two ray-- you

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.550
can think of two marginal rays.

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:45.060
One is the marginal
ray that goes

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.110
through the meridional plane.

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:54.610
So the meridional plane is
the one shown like this,

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.540
and the other is
the marginal ray

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.580
that goes through the
sagittal plane, perpendicular

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.820
to the meridional plane.

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:08.310
So astigmatism occurs
because the two--

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.890
now take cross-sections of
the rays in the two planes--

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.540
the sagittal and the
meridional plane.

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.670
That two ray bundles,
they do not necessarily

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:18.870
focus at the same place.

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.810
In the sagittal plane,
actually, if you

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:27.650
tried to visualize it
in the sagittal plane,

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.940
there is no difference
than normal incidence.

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:31.860
So you basically get--

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.380
so whereas in the meridional
plane, because you

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.848
are off-axis, you
have this property

00:03:40.848 --> 00:03:42.390
that we discussed
before, that you'll

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:47.410
get different magnification at
different points in the field.

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:50.400
So as a result, these
two might actually

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.660
yield different focal distances.

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.680
So this is depicted here,
actually, where you're seeing--

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.320
it's actually a
pretty good diagram.

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:02.020
You can see the sagittal plane
and the meridional plane.

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:06.630
And you can see that the
sagittal plane actually

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:08.670
focuses out here.

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:11.410
It is F sub S for sagittal.

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:13.860
Whereas the meridional
plane focuses here.

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:17.459
It is called F sub
T for tangential.

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:21.060
So if an optical system is
subject to this problem,

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:22.689
we just call astigmatic.

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.820
The typical way that people
characterize astigmatism

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:31.530
is with a spoke wheel.

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:35.125
And most of you must
have taken eye exams.

00:04:35.125 --> 00:04:36.750
They give you a
similar test, actually,

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:38.890
to test if your
eyes are astigmatic

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:40.290
and you need correction.

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:43.020
They show you something
like this, a spoke wheel.

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:48.810
And they ask you, basically, if
the spokes are simultaneously

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:57.040
in focus with the circle.

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:00.330
The outline circle.

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:04.440
So if the system
is astigmatic, then

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:09.910
as you move a piece of paper
along the optical axis,

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:12.300
you will see one of them
come to a focus first,

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.960
and the sagittal come
to the focus later.

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:15.460
OK.

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:23.880
So that's astigmatism.

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:32.290
I hear some voices,
but I think they're

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:34.820
from the next classroom,
not from Boston.

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:38.120
Did anybody say anything there?

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:38.850
I guess not.

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:39.350
OK.

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:48.040
A related aberration, which
has to do with the fact that--

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:49.450
well, let me say first.

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:52.840
So a related aberration is
called caricature of field.

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:56.230
This one is actually
easy to understand.

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:57.160
It says the following.

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:01.660
It says that if you derive the
imaging condition for a point

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:06.690
on-axis, then imagine
you go off-axis,

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:10.680
it says that the image
may not necessarily

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:18.650
focus on the same plane
as the image on-axis.

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:22.100
In fact, what this
aberration is about

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:28.780
is that the image actually comes
to focus on a curved surface.

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:31.730
Center of the optical axis.

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:33.350
Now, why do we care
about the plane?

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:35.450
Why do we want this
to be a plane here?

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:37.640
Well, in old
fashion cameras, one

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:41.470
used to put film at the
image plane of the camera.

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:45.050
So we have to be sure that
the entire image is focused

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:46.670
simultaneously on the film.

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:48.050
Nowadays, we don't use film.

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:51.200
We use a digital chip.

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:53.810
But in both cases, they're flat.

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:55.580
So curvature of field
is a problem then

00:06:55.580 --> 00:07:04.770
because it says that actually
the off-axis image points will

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:06.530
be out of focus
because they will focus

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:08.387
in front of the final plane.

00:07:08.387 --> 00:07:10.470
So these are the kind of
things that if you could,

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:14.688
for example, make a
curve chip surface,

00:07:14.688 --> 00:07:15.980
you could solve it immediately.

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:19.610
All we have to do is match
the surface of the chip

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:23.300
to the surface of the
curvature of the field.

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:25.087
But in fact, actually,
people are trying

00:07:25.087 --> 00:07:26.170
to do something like that.

00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:28.570
There's a lot of work
on flexible electronics.

00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:31.340
And that's one of
the motivations.

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:35.766
But it is not yet
widely available.

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:45.050
Nevertheless, there
is one condition

00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:50.420
where the surfaces that the
field comes to focus actually

00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:51.640
becomes flat.

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:53.720
This was derived
by a mathematician.

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:54.470
I don't know when.

00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:58.220
I think it was in
the early 1900s.

00:07:58.220 --> 00:07:59.660
His name is Petzval.

00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:03.680
So this condition, it has a
more complicated expression.

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:07.100
But for two lenses, it works
out to something like this.

00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:12.560
If the sum of these
quantities where

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:15.790
n1 is the index of
refraction of the lens.

00:08:15.790 --> 00:08:17.245
And f1 is the focal length.

00:08:17.245 --> 00:08:18.620
So it's a little
bit unusual now.

00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:21.950
We multiply the focal length
by an index of refraction.

00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:23.160
We've never done that before.

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:25.520
But this is what
this guy derived.

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:28.130
If they two sum up to
zero, these quantities

00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:35.360
for a pair of lenses, then the
field of curvature vanishes.

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:44.430
And what is even more sort of
remarkable about this relation

00:08:44.430 --> 00:08:46.980
is that it does not involve the
space in between the lenses.

00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:52.430
No matter where they are, if
they satisfy this condition,

00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:56.530
the field of curvature
will be eliminated.

00:08:56.530 --> 00:09:01.390
And so for example,
if they are composed

00:09:01.390 --> 00:09:05.020
of the same index of refraction,
then the index of refraction

00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:07.430
also drops out of this equation.

00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:12.130
And then you can treat them as
a composite, as a thick lens,

00:09:12.130 --> 00:09:14.650
basically, which this is a
relationship that we already

00:09:14.650 --> 00:09:18.340
derived for a composite element.

00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:22.270
And you can make
sure that one of them

00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:27.370
is the negative of the other so
that you can make this quantity

00:09:27.370 --> 00:09:28.180
vanish.

00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:30.737
That is, f1 is
equal to minus f2.

00:09:30.737 --> 00:09:32.320
And then you can
find the focal length

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:34.020
from this equation over here.

00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:37.360
So it's kind of cool because
it says that you can actually

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:38.465
eliminate--

00:09:38.465 --> 00:09:39.840
if it is really
important to you,

00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:45.500
you can eliminate this problem
by using the Petzval condition.

00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:47.560
And again, there's a more
complicated condition

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:50.380
that applies to
multilens systems that

00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:51.910
have more than two lenses.

00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:54.710
But I didn't bother
to draw it here.

00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:56.720
And what is even
more remarkable is

00:09:56.720 --> 00:10:00.950
that the Petzval surface
and the field curvature

00:10:00.950 --> 00:10:04.820
is also related to astigmatism.

00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:10.280
So what you see in this plot
here, also from the textbook,

00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:15.460
is the focal surfaces-- that is,
the surfaces in which different

00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:17.870
points from a flat--

00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:19.430
if you take a flat
object and you

00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:22.160
take different points
along this object,

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:24.350
these three surfaces
are correspondingly

00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:27.860
the tangential focus for
the astigmatic system,

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:37.450
the sagittal focus, and
finally the Petzval surface.

00:10:37.450 --> 00:10:38.920
Yeah.

00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:40.680
Let me go for [INAUDIBLE].

00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:44.090
So what we discussed here is
actually the Petzval condition.

00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:47.840
I haven't said yet what
is the Petzval surface.

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:50.810
So the Petzval surface
is the following.

00:10:50.810 --> 00:10:54.770
It turns out that as
you change the stopping

00:10:54.770 --> 00:10:57.115
and optical system--
that is, as you move

00:10:57.115 --> 00:11:00.890
the stop in the
axial direction, you

00:11:00.890 --> 00:11:03.230
can achieve the condition
where the tangential

00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:06.350
and the sagittal
astigmatic focal

00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:10.100
surfaces, they collapse
into one surface.

00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:13.430
This surface is called
the Petzval surface,

00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:15.380
not to be confused with
the Petzval condition,

00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:18.120
even though, of course,
they are related.

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:19.730
So what you see
here is basically,

00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:21.980
as you move the stop
in an optical system--

00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:25.325
this is borrowed from
another textbook, not from--

00:11:25.325 --> 00:11:26.700
I should have
recorded, actually.

00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:30.890
This is from Jenkins and
White, Fundamentals of Optics.

00:11:30.890 --> 00:11:35.510
So as you move the stop,
you can find the situation

00:11:35.510 --> 00:11:39.050
where the two surfaces coincide,
and that is the Petzval surface

00:11:39.050 --> 00:11:39.770
of the system.

00:11:39.770 --> 00:11:43.070
And of course, this one does not
satisfy the Petzval condition

00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:45.980
because the Petzval
surface is curved.

00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:50.150
If I could somehow satisfy
both the Petzval condition

00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:54.560
and collapse that to surfaces--
tangential and sagittal--

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:59.210
onto the Petzval, then I
would have a flat system

00:11:59.210 --> 00:12:03.380
with a flat field, which would
also be free of astigmatism.

00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:13.540
So obviously we cannot get
into too much detail about this

00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:16.360
without becoming quantitative.

00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:19.910
And this is quite difficult
to deal with algebra,

00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:22.090
so I'm just being descriptive.

00:12:22.090 --> 00:12:23.900
And you will see some
of this in action

00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:30.820
when Se Baek does the demo of
the software in a little bit.

00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:34.367
And the light distortion
that I will discuss

00:12:34.367 --> 00:12:36.200
has to do with something
slightly different.

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:40.240
So the field of curvature
occurs and astigmatism

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:45.370
occurs because if you take
object points off-axis,

00:12:45.370 --> 00:12:47.990
they fail to focus
at the same plane.

00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:52.480
They focus at different planes
and on different surfaces,

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:55.010
the sagittal and tangential.

00:12:55.010 --> 00:12:57.010
The distortion
occurs because even

00:12:57.010 --> 00:13:00.550
if you manage to
focus at one plane,

00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:02.200
the magnification is different.

00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:05.240
The magnification-- and this you
can see very easily, actually,

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:08.710
just looking at this
diagram over here.

00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:12.510
If you take the on-axis point,
the imaging and condition

00:13:12.510 --> 00:13:15.520
of the magnification are
given by these distances.

00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:17.490
For example, the
lateral magnification

00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:22.040
is the ratio of this
distance to this distance.

00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:23.320
But what about this point now?

00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:26.900
For this point, the
lateral magnification

00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:31.670
will be the ratio of this
distance to this distance.

00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:33.890
And for those of
you in Boston, I'm

00:13:33.890 --> 00:13:38.290
pointing out to the
tilted chief ray.

00:13:38.290 --> 00:13:41.270
So I have to
measure the distance

00:13:41.270 --> 00:13:43.332
from the lens on the chief ray.

00:13:43.332 --> 00:13:45.290
And you can see very
easily that this length is

00:13:45.290 --> 00:13:47.690
different than the
length of the chief ray

00:13:47.690 --> 00:13:49.730
for the on-axis point.

00:13:49.730 --> 00:13:52.970
So because of that, the
magnification on-axis

00:13:52.970 --> 00:13:55.520
is different than the
magnification off-axis.

00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:59.240
Therefore, if I attempt
to image a checkerboard,

00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:02.720
like this, if the
magnification is different,

00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:10.410
I will see this sort of--

00:14:10.410 --> 00:14:12.540
I don't want to use
the word "distorted."

00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:15.530
You will see this
sort of altered--

00:14:15.530 --> 00:14:18.120
let's say altered-- image.

00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:20.250
And this is the
definition of distortion.

00:14:20.250 --> 00:14:22.440
So in optics we have
to be a little careful.

00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:25.020
Distortion, colloquially,
means everything.

00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:27.990
All of the stuff that
I described before.

00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:30.660
In everyday English, you
can call them distortions.

00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:32.760
Well, in optics, in
professional optics,

00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:37.080
when we mention distortion, we
automatically mean this one.

00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:39.420
So we have to be careful
not to use the word

00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:41.060
"distortion" in the
colloquial sense

00:14:41.060 --> 00:14:46.390
because it is reserved
to mean exactly that.

00:14:46.390 --> 00:14:50.170
And I guess it has two forms.

00:14:50.170 --> 00:14:53.350
It can be of this type,
where the magnification is

00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:55.300
higher off-axis.

00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:57.310
That is called pincushion.

00:14:57.310 --> 00:15:00.370
Or lower, that is called barrel.

00:15:00.370 --> 00:15:05.170
And they believe, in this case,
the top one will give rise

00:15:05.170 --> 00:15:10.420
to barrel because in this
case, because the stop is here,

00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:19.720
the aperture stop is here, the
chief ray on the object side

00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:22.470
becomes longer off-axis.

00:15:22.470 --> 00:15:24.820
Now, if you recall,
the magnification

00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:30.580
is the lateral
magnification equals

00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:36.880
S on the image side over S on
the object side with a minus

00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:37.380
sign.

00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:40.240
But the minus is
irrelevant here.

00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:42.560
So since I made--

00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:46.320
so in this case, S
on the image side

00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:49.120
is approximately
the same as on-axis.

00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:52.120
But S on the object
side became longer

00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:54.650
by putting the stop here.

00:15:54.650 --> 00:15:57.640
So therefore, I get a lower
magnification off-axis.

00:15:57.640 --> 00:16:00.730
Therefore, I get this
type of distortion.

00:16:00.730 --> 00:16:03.100
If I put the stop
on the other side,

00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:05.650
then it is the opposite case.

00:16:05.650 --> 00:16:09.460
Now I make this length longer.

00:16:09.460 --> 00:16:14.860
Therefore, I get
pincushion distortion.

00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:17.770
And of course, the way to
eliminate distortion altogether

00:16:17.770 --> 00:16:21.250
is to make the system like this.

00:16:21.250 --> 00:16:23.650
This is actually a
telecentric system.

00:16:23.650 --> 00:16:26.620
And to make sure that
the stop is exactly

00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:28.810
at the center of the system.

00:16:28.810 --> 00:16:31.420
And also-- yes.

00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:38.050
And so if you do
that, then basically

00:16:38.050 --> 00:16:41.880
a little bit of thought will
convince you that in this case

00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:45.780
the variation between this
length is actually very small.

00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:50.010
So therefore, there
is some distortion,

00:16:50.010 --> 00:16:51.480
but it is high order.

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:54.550
The third order distortion is
completely eliminated here.

00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:57.180
So you basically get a
distortion-free image.

00:17:00.330 --> 00:17:00.830
OK.

00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:11.720
So before I turn over
to Se Baek and Pepe,

00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:14.245
last time I mentioned caustics.

00:17:18.876 --> 00:17:21.290
So I would like to
show what caustics are.

00:17:21.290 --> 00:17:24.349
So this is actually from the
last page of today's notes,

00:17:24.349 --> 00:17:26.900
which I haven't done yet.

00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:30.890
And the details here
are not very important.

00:17:30.890 --> 00:17:32.510
By the end of the
lecture today, you

00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:34.460
will know what
has happened here.

00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:38.720
This is a special type of lens
called a gradient index lens.

00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:42.200
And I simulated it with
off-axis incidence.

00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:44.820
So therefore, in this
case, we have coma.

00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:48.860
So if you look at the ray, these
are ray traces of this lens.

00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:53.540
For now, please accepted the
fact that the rays are curved.

00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:55.360
But what I wanted
to show you here,

00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:59.490
what is the caustic that I
mentioned in the last lecture.

00:17:59.490 --> 00:18:03.660
You can see that in the
bottom side of this diagram

00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:06.740
that ray paths, they kind
of collapse onto each other.

00:18:06.740 --> 00:18:09.050
So you see that the rays
are relatively uniformly

00:18:09.050 --> 00:18:11.870
distributed up to this
point approximately.

00:18:11.870 --> 00:18:15.740
Over here, they begin to
accumulate near one side.

00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:17.540
So what you would
expect in this case,

00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:18.920
if you put a piece
of paper here,

00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:23.360
is you would expect very
strong light intensity

00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:26.880
near the bottom of the beam.

00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:29.390
So that is what
we call a caustic.

00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:34.730
And I think in the examples
that the guys will show you

00:18:34.730 --> 00:18:37.590
in the demo, you will also
see some caustics form

00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:38.330
in real life.

00:18:38.330 --> 00:18:40.580
But this is what I was
trying to describe last time.

00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:41.680
OK.

00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:43.490
So Pepe and Se
Baek, I don't know

00:18:43.490 --> 00:18:44.740
if you guys are ready but--

00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:46.760
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:47.760
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: OK.

00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:49.490
PROFESSOR: Can you
help me with that.

00:18:49.490 --> 00:18:50.907
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
Take it away.

00:19:15.145 --> 00:19:17.770
PROFESSOR: So this is a similar
demo to the one that we showed.

00:19:17.770 --> 00:19:19.645
Now we're going to focus
on a different thing

00:19:19.645 --> 00:19:21.730
of the aberrations that
we've been learning.

00:19:21.730 --> 00:19:27.460
So so far we've seen two type
of aberrations in the system

00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:29.890
that we can identify
very easily.

00:19:29.890 --> 00:19:32.170
But first, let me
describe the components.

00:19:32.170 --> 00:19:34.500
So can you go back here.

00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:37.490
So for this one here we
start with a laser, as usual.

00:19:37.490 --> 00:19:40.510
And now we know that we have
a collimating system so used

00:19:40.510 --> 00:19:43.450
to condition the light and make
a nice plane wave at the output

00:19:43.450 --> 00:19:44.740
here.

00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:47.980
And then this plane wave
illuminates these lens,

00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:50.990
which is a cylindrical
lens, shown here.

00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:54.640
And then we are just looking
at the rays going on.

00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:55.930
And this is for a green laser.

00:19:55.930 --> 00:19:58.660
It's a wavelength
of 532 nanometers.

00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:00.940
So now let's think what's
happening, actually.

00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:04.170
So we can reduce exposure.

00:20:04.170 --> 00:20:05.560
OK.

00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:15.190
So we can see at this point
how the rays start converging.

00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:19.900
But it's a bit hard to
see here, but they do not

00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:22.540
focus in a tight point.

00:20:22.540 --> 00:20:24.610
They actually focus
at different points.

00:20:24.610 --> 00:20:26.250
And as we'll see
in the software,

00:20:26.250 --> 00:20:28.870
this is basically the
experimental version

00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:30.970
of a spherical aberration
that we can see.

00:20:30.970 --> 00:20:34.510
And in this case, I'm
illuminating the lens

00:20:34.510 --> 00:20:36.550
with an on-axis plane wave.

00:20:36.550 --> 00:20:38.290
So therefore, we can
see its condition.

00:20:38.290 --> 00:20:42.910
Now let's try to look
at the case of coma

00:20:42.910 --> 00:20:45.800
as seen from the top.

00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:48.775
So what I'm doing is that
I'm rotating the lens.

00:20:52.850 --> 00:20:58.210
And then we can see
how the rays start

00:20:58.210 --> 00:21:00.500
forming an asymmetric pattern.

00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:02.335
And let me try to get
this closer together.

00:21:10.750 --> 00:21:13.950
So now for this
off-axis plane wave,

00:21:13.950 --> 00:21:18.590
we see that that's some of
the rays go straight through

00:21:18.590 --> 00:21:22.110
and some of the rays form these
caustics here that we just

00:21:22.110 --> 00:21:22.830
mentioned--

00:21:22.830 --> 00:21:25.650
George mentioned in the slides.

00:21:25.650 --> 00:21:30.660
If we were to put a page
perpendicular to this one

00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:34.097
that I have here, which is
hard because we need actually

00:21:34.097 --> 00:21:36.180
a camera in order to show
you that with very, very

00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:39.210
tiny pixels because the
actual point produces

00:21:39.210 --> 00:21:43.000
or the focus produced by this
lens would be very small.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.900
But if we do that, we
would see the comma shape

00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:46.920
that we described.

00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:51.600
And we're actually going to see
that in the simulation software

00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:53.697
that we're going to show later.

00:21:53.697 --> 00:21:54.780
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: Pepe?

00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:55.530
PROFESSOR: Yep?

00:21:55.530 --> 00:21:57.280
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
Is it possible to put

00:21:57.280 --> 00:21:59.010
the other business
card-- can you

00:21:59.010 --> 00:22:02.270
put the back of the
business card there?

00:22:02.270 --> 00:22:04.397
PROFESSOR: You're
saying perpendicular?

00:22:04.397 --> 00:22:05.480
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: Yeah.

00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:07.520
PROFESSOR: You don't
see anything, George.

00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:09.050
This is a cylindrical lens.

00:22:09.050 --> 00:22:10.337
This is cylindrical.

00:22:10.337 --> 00:22:11.420
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: Yeah.

00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:12.410
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:22:12.410 --> 00:22:15.720
And you see what I'm saying?

00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:18.350
These are cylindrical lens.

00:22:18.350 --> 00:22:23.390
And even with a CCD,
it's very, very small.

00:22:23.390 --> 00:22:26.090
You would need something, in
order to measure it accurately,

00:22:26.090 --> 00:22:28.880
something that is called a
Foucault knife edge test,

00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:32.657
for example, where you actually
can measure what is called

00:22:32.657 --> 00:22:33.740
the point spread function.

00:22:33.740 --> 00:22:36.450
And we're going to learn that
in the next part of the course.

00:22:36.450 --> 00:22:36.950
All right.

00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:41.240
So let me show you another
type of aberration.

00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:44.240
Now imaging our transparency.

00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:46.700
In this case, I just
have a white light source

00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:49.320
that is illuminating this
object, which is just

00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:53.180
a transparency with some GRIN.

00:22:53.180 --> 00:22:56.360
In this case, it's going to be
just the GRIN that George was

00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:59.000
showing that is regular GRIN.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.920
And I have a single lens here.

00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:07.800
It's a spherical lens, biconvex,
with a short focal length.

00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:11.100
So therefore, the
curvature is pretty high,

00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:12.970
and we expect to have
a lot of aberrations.

00:23:12.970 --> 00:23:14.720
But the one that we're
going to see here--

00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:16.520
we can decrease
exposure-- we're going

00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:18.220
to see the evidence
of distortion,

00:23:18.220 --> 00:23:20.540
the aberration of distortion.

00:23:20.540 --> 00:23:23.240
And as you can see here--

00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:25.610
let's just focus in.

00:23:25.610 --> 00:23:26.840
You see how the lines--

00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:31.250
similar to the slide
that George just showed,

00:23:31.250 --> 00:23:34.070
the lines are actually
curved by this lens.

00:23:34.070 --> 00:23:36.920
Although these are supposed
to be straight lines,

00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:37.790
they are curved.

00:23:37.790 --> 00:23:39.560
Let me just magnify
a little bit this.

00:23:43.011 --> 00:23:44.976
There you go.

00:23:44.976 --> 00:23:45.476
Increase.

00:23:53.390 --> 00:23:56.420
Now if we were to replace
these with another lens--

00:23:56.420 --> 00:23:59.240
so for example, this one that
has a longer focal length--

00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:01.820
the radius of
curvature is larger.

00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:04.080
So it's basically not
as curved as this one.

00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:10.310
And we're trying to do the same.

00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:13.280
Now what I'm going to do is I'm
going to use this lens to image

00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:15.440
my transparency.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:33.530
Now we can see how the lines
look much more straight.

00:24:33.530 --> 00:24:36.810
That distortion
aberration got reduced.

00:24:36.810 --> 00:24:39.200
So what type of aberration
did you guys see?

00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:42.380
It was pincushions
or barrel aberration,

00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:45.590
the one that you saw before?

00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:49.430
I'm going to put it again
while you guys think.

00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:09.850
Which one is this?

00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:16.970
I can hear.

00:25:16.970 --> 00:25:18.220
Just press the button, please.

00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:21.980
AUDIENCE: Pincushion?

00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:22.930
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:25:22.930 --> 00:25:23.430
Yeah.

00:25:23.430 --> 00:25:25.800
We see the evidence of the
magnification of the lenses.

00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:28.560
It's maybe hard for
you being able to see.

00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:33.820
But here, the lines basically
get curved to outside.

00:25:33.820 --> 00:25:36.450
So in the break, if you guys
want to come on and just

00:25:36.450 --> 00:25:39.450
play with the demo and
change the focal length

00:25:39.450 --> 00:25:42.570
and see where the images get
formed, and also this one here,

00:25:42.570 --> 00:25:43.920
you're welcome to do so.

00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:46.260
Now we're going to switch
to our numerical software

00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:49.350
to show how we actually
deal with these in practice

00:25:49.350 --> 00:25:54.030
to optimize an imaging system.

00:26:07.425 --> 00:26:08.050
SE BAEK OH: OK.

00:26:11.930 --> 00:26:14.990
So people, before we move
on to next topic, which

00:26:14.990 --> 00:26:17.720
is a GRIN medium and
Hamiltonian optics,

00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:20.570
we want to show how we
actually build or design

00:26:20.570 --> 00:26:25.010
the actual imaging optical
system in practice.

00:26:25.010 --> 00:26:28.860
Of course, so far we
learn a lot of stuff.

00:26:28.860 --> 00:26:32.690
The Snell's law, and
reflection and refraction,

00:26:32.690 --> 00:26:35.270
and the lens maker's
law, and paraxial optics,

00:26:35.270 --> 00:26:36.350
and blah, blah, blah.

00:26:36.350 --> 00:26:41.220
But in real life, we usually
use a computer software.

00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:44.960
So just to give you an
example, since most of you

00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:48.050
are mechanical engineer,
including myself.

00:26:48.050 --> 00:26:50.070
So let's think about this.

00:26:50.070 --> 00:26:53.290
If you want to build some
toy or some mechanical model

00:26:53.290 --> 00:26:59.930
for your bike or car
or toy, what do you do

00:26:59.930 --> 00:27:02.920
is you start with
sketching by hand.

00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:04.850
So make the conceptual model.

00:27:04.850 --> 00:27:07.850
And then you go to computer.

00:27:07.850 --> 00:27:08.810
Use the CAD program.

00:27:08.810 --> 00:27:11.660
So your build the
2D or 3D model.

00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:14.390
And if you have
multiple element,

00:27:14.390 --> 00:27:16.760
you can even assembly,
in SolidWorks.

00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:19.970
And you can export the 3D model.

00:27:19.970 --> 00:27:24.330
And if your system is
complicated enough,

00:27:24.330 --> 00:27:27.170
you can also use
finite element model

00:27:27.170 --> 00:27:32.330
to analyze the stress or strain
or the temperature variations,

00:27:32.330 --> 00:27:33.320
blah, blah, blah.

00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:34.310
Same idea.

00:27:34.310 --> 00:27:40.160
You start with the conceptual
model by drawing a few rays.

00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:46.100
And then you apply lens law
and the 1 over object distance

00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:49.010
plus 1 over image distance
should be 1 over f.

00:27:49.010 --> 00:27:53.150
And sometime you only
use the [INAUDIBLE]..

00:27:53.150 --> 00:27:55.010
But after that
you go to computer

00:27:55.010 --> 00:27:58.520
and use probably one of these
commercialized software, which

00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:02.600
is Code V. So it's not
V. It's a Roman number.

00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:06.551
So Code V or ZEMAX and Oslo.

00:28:06.551 --> 00:28:11.243
So the Code V and ZEMAX, they
are industrial standards.

00:28:11.243 --> 00:28:12.660
And they are pretty
much the same.

00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:14.710
So if you can
handle one of these,

00:28:14.710 --> 00:28:17.230
then it's very easy to do--

00:28:17.230 --> 00:28:19.660
easy to use the other one.

00:28:19.660 --> 00:28:23.680
So essentially what it does
is it draws some rays for you

00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:28.740
but very fast, and
it's automated fashion.

00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:32.470
Because if you have CAD
program, you can use actually

00:28:32.470 --> 00:28:33.850
do this ray tracing.

00:28:33.850 --> 00:28:35.750
So you just draw a ray.

00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:38.110
And whenever you
meet the interface,

00:28:38.110 --> 00:28:41.260
you complete the incident
angle to the surface normal

00:28:41.260 --> 00:28:44.290
and apply the Snell's law
and compute refraction angle

00:28:44.290 --> 00:28:46.150
and do the same thing.

00:28:46.150 --> 00:28:49.570
But it's very
complicated, especially

00:28:49.570 --> 00:28:51.710
you have the 3D model.

00:28:51.710 --> 00:28:55.100
So this program
does that for you.

00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:59.080
And it actually has
very different method

00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:00.470
to do the ray tracing.

00:29:00.470 --> 00:29:03.030
So first of all it's just--

00:29:03.030 --> 00:29:05.440
actually, we learn the
ray transfer matrices.

00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:11.420
So it does ray tracing based
on the paraxial region.

00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:16.450
But probably one of the reasons
that we use the software.

00:29:16.450 --> 00:29:18.060
It does the real ray tracing.

00:29:18.060 --> 00:29:23.670
Just as I described,
it just trace every ray

00:29:23.670 --> 00:29:26.570
based on Snell's law.

00:29:26.570 --> 00:29:32.570
And you can use it--

00:29:32.570 --> 00:29:36.720
and actually, it also has
many built-in features

00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:40.170
to analyze performance
of optical system,

00:29:40.170 --> 00:29:41.710
like aberration.

00:29:41.710 --> 00:29:45.540
So we learn about the five
geometric aberrations.

00:29:45.540 --> 00:29:46.860
You can analyze it.

00:29:46.860 --> 00:29:48.840
And also, point spread
function or spot

00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:53.460
diagram, which means if you have
ideal imaging system and lets

00:29:53.460 --> 00:29:57.740
say we have point
object, the images

00:29:57.740 --> 00:30:00.840
should be also infinitely
small point, assuming

00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:02.190
that they are conjugated.

00:30:02.190 --> 00:30:06.510
But in real life, it
never be like this

00:30:06.510 --> 00:30:14.460
because you always have the
finite size of focused image.

00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:16.680
So point spread
function or spot diagram

00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:21.780
tells you how big is your
focus at the image plane.

00:30:21.780 --> 00:30:25.570
And it also analyze MTF or OTF,
which is frequency analysis.

00:30:25.570 --> 00:30:29.820
We cover later of the course.

00:30:29.820 --> 00:30:34.260
And probably--
actually, another reason

00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:36.030
that we have to
use this software

00:30:36.030 --> 00:30:40.140
is to optimize the
optical system.

00:30:40.140 --> 00:30:43.110
I prepared some
examples, so we will see.

00:30:54.970 --> 00:30:56.850
So this is the--

00:30:56.850 --> 00:30:59.250
so we are using the ZEMAX.

00:30:59.250 --> 00:31:02.060
Just the one of the
industry's standard.

00:31:02.060 --> 00:31:06.880
And if you open
the ZEMAX in this,

00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:12.070
we have this table, which
basically are lens data editor.

00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:14.740
So filling in this
table means you

00:31:14.740 --> 00:31:16.010
specify your optical system.

00:31:16.010 --> 00:31:18.210
I'll describe how to do it.

00:31:18.210 --> 00:31:19.570
But once you have this--

00:31:19.570 --> 00:31:21.580
once you fill in
this table, then you

00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:25.990
can analyze very
different stuff.

00:31:25.990 --> 00:31:30.890
So for example, it shows the
actual layout of a system,

00:31:30.890 --> 00:31:32.050
like this one.

00:31:32.050 --> 00:31:33.740
This 2D layout.

00:31:33.740 --> 00:31:39.200
And it even made the 3D
model for you, like this one.

00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:42.620
So it can check the actual
shape of the system.

00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:56.280
So this is called [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:56.280 --> 00:32:01.290
So actually, the horizontal axis
is actually your pupil plane,

00:32:01.290 --> 00:32:05.500
and vertical axis is deviation
of the ray at the image plane.

00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:06.720
So if you have--

00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:08.670
so if your system
is aberration free,

00:32:08.670 --> 00:32:11.460
then these lines should
be just horizontal here

00:32:11.460 --> 00:32:14.280
because all the rays
meet at the point.

00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:18.180
But this is practical system so
you have the deviation, which

00:32:18.180 --> 00:32:21.140
means you have aberration.

00:32:21.140 --> 00:32:28.780
And these guys are spot diagram.

00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:32.190
So if you have point object
in your object space,

00:32:32.190 --> 00:32:36.150
then you'll probably
get this kind of focus

00:32:36.150 --> 00:32:37.740
at your image plane.

00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:45.510
And this is same thing but
for different wavelengths

00:32:45.510 --> 00:32:49.320
because the glass
is dispersive, which

00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:53.482
means the refractive
index is also

00:32:53.482 --> 00:32:54.690
a function of the wavelength.

00:32:54.690 --> 00:32:59.280
So if you change the wavelength,
then the shape of these spots

00:32:59.280 --> 00:32:59.880
also change.

00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:04.680
So it analyzed this
dispersive property.

00:33:10.970 --> 00:33:12.340
OK.

00:33:12.340 --> 00:33:17.090
So let me explain how to
fit into those tables.

00:33:17.090 --> 00:33:20.210
So let's say we have
this two lens system.

00:33:20.210 --> 00:33:25.310
So what you do is you
just decompose your system

00:33:25.310 --> 00:33:26.930
to multiple surface.

00:33:26.930 --> 00:33:29.400
So for example, here
I have the object.

00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:32.300
So this is by
default surface zero.

00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:35.150
And the first surface
should be the front surface

00:33:35.150 --> 00:33:37.430
of the first lens here.

00:33:37.430 --> 00:33:43.610
And surface two is the back
surface of the first lens.

00:33:43.610 --> 00:33:46.580
And the surface three
is the front surface

00:33:46.580 --> 00:33:49.650
of the second lens,
and so on and so forth.

00:33:49.650 --> 00:33:53.720
So in the table we have the
different-- the multiple roles.

00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:57.380
So each role represent
the one surface.

00:33:57.380 --> 00:34:00.500
And the radius means the radius
curvature of the surface.

00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:04.640
So for example, here,
since this object is flat,

00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:07.390
the radius curvature
is infinity.

00:34:07.390 --> 00:34:10.449
And thickness is the
distance from the surface

00:34:10.449 --> 00:34:11.690
to the next surface.

00:34:11.690 --> 00:34:15.310
So in this case, d0 is
the distance from here

00:34:15.310 --> 00:34:16.780
to the first lens.

00:34:16.780 --> 00:34:20.380
And in some case, if you deal
with the infinite conjugate,

00:34:20.380 --> 00:34:24.400
like telescope, then
this d0 could be infinite

00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:27.760
because your object
is at infinity.

00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:30.879
And at the surface one,
I have the lens which

00:34:30.879 --> 00:34:33.400
has the radius curvature R1.

00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:34.600
So I have R1.

00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:39.310
And thickness d1 represent the
thickness of the actual length

00:34:39.310 --> 00:34:42.580
from here to here.

00:34:42.580 --> 00:34:45.699
And after the surface
one, I have the glass.

00:34:45.699 --> 00:34:51.060
So I just can specify the type
of glass, which is BK7 here.

00:34:51.060 --> 00:34:54.520
This is the most
common optical glass.

00:34:54.520 --> 00:34:56.300
And you just keep
repeating this one.

00:34:56.300 --> 00:35:00.650
So once you have this
and you have the--

00:35:00.650 --> 00:35:04.300
you just fill in the
table in the ZEMAX.

00:35:04.300 --> 00:35:06.730
And there are also other
parameters you have to specify.

00:35:06.730 --> 00:35:09.580
So as I said, the wavelength.

00:35:09.580 --> 00:35:14.770
And you also need to choose
the field parameter, which

00:35:14.770 --> 00:35:16.880
basically this means
object information.

00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:19.390
So if your object is
in finite distance,

00:35:19.390 --> 00:35:25.240
then field means object
height or size of your object,

00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:30.400
or if it is infinite, you
can set the incident angle

00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:32.921
to the system, just
like the telescope.

00:35:35.690 --> 00:35:41.020
So first example I
prepare is actually

00:35:41.020 --> 00:35:43.760
the example the lecture three.

00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:46.340
So we had the two lens.

00:35:46.340 --> 00:35:50.930
Both of them have the focal
length of 10 here and here.

00:35:50.930 --> 00:35:52.970
And if you went
through the derivation,

00:35:52.970 --> 00:35:56.960
we had the several
different ways to derive.

00:35:56.960 --> 00:35:59.128
But the image distance--
actually, it's

00:35:59.128 --> 00:35:59.920
not image distance.

00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:02.750
The imaging is located
at 30 millimeter

00:36:02.750 --> 00:36:05.900
behind the second length,
and the lateral magnification

00:36:05.900 --> 00:36:08.660
was negative 4.

00:36:08.660 --> 00:36:12.890
And also, if you did the
wavelength of matrices,

00:36:12.890 --> 00:36:17.090
then effective focal length was
20 over 3, which is about 7.

00:36:17.090 --> 00:36:19.530
And the front focal length
and back focal length

00:36:19.530 --> 00:36:21.710
was 10 over 3.

00:36:21.710 --> 00:36:23.450
So about 3, right?

00:36:23.450 --> 00:36:30.615
So in ZEMAX, I already
filled in the table.

00:36:41.720 --> 00:36:45.930
So this is the how
the system looks like.

00:36:45.930 --> 00:36:49.020
I have the object here,
and I have the image here.

00:36:51.870 --> 00:36:55.800
And if you analyze
the system, then it

00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:59.050
gives you all the
specifications here.

00:36:59.050 --> 00:37:03.260
So here, the effective
focal length is 6-point--

00:37:03.260 --> 00:37:05.690
I don't know you can see, but
the effective focal length

00:37:05.690 --> 00:37:07.600
is 6.92.

00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:08.490
So about 7.

00:37:08.490 --> 00:37:11.120
So we have a good
agreement here.

00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:13.640
And the back focal
length is about 3.05.

00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:16.490
So about 3.

00:37:23.290 --> 00:37:28.270
And the paraxial
magnification is negative 4.8.

00:37:28.270 --> 00:37:34.720
So we have a slightly bigger
magnification in real system,

00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:36.020
and so on and so forth.

00:37:36.020 --> 00:37:37.970
And also, I put the
aperture stuff here.

00:37:37.970 --> 00:37:42.120
So you can compute
the diameter--

00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:44.890
the size and position of the
entrance pupil and exit pupil

00:37:44.890 --> 00:37:45.962
as well.

00:37:45.962 --> 00:37:47.170
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: Se Baek?

00:37:47.170 --> 00:37:47.837
SE BAEK OH: Yes?

00:37:47.837 --> 00:37:50.295
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: I think
the reason for the discrepancy

00:37:50.295 --> 00:37:53.193
is that the lenses have finite
thickness in your model, right?

00:37:53.193 --> 00:37:53.860
SE BAEK OH: Yes.

00:37:53.860 --> 00:37:58.090
So in real model, as you
can see in the layout,

00:37:58.090 --> 00:37:59.660
this is not in length.

00:37:59.660 --> 00:38:04.860
And I just put the
brief numbers--

00:38:04.860 --> 00:38:06.060
the radius of the lens.

00:38:06.060 --> 00:38:08.170
So I just put the 10.5.

00:38:08.170 --> 00:38:11.990
And the thickness of the lens
in 1 millimeter in this case.

00:38:11.990 --> 00:38:13.240
So it's not the real length.

00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:15.600
So it gives you slightly
different numbers.

00:38:22.650 --> 00:38:25.500
And the next example is actually
the Hubble Space Telescope.

00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:28.140
So Professor
Barbastathis already

00:38:28.140 --> 00:38:32.970
mentioned the last lecture
about this telescope.

00:38:32.970 --> 00:38:40.200
So actually, NASA realized after
they launched this telescope

00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:43.830
and find out the image is not
good as it's supposed to be.

00:38:43.830 --> 00:38:47.460
And they form a committee to
investigate what's the problem.

00:38:47.460 --> 00:38:52.450
And they eventually figured
out, and they fix it.

00:38:52.450 --> 00:38:55.300
But let's just start
with the structure here.

00:38:55.300 --> 00:39:00.810
So this is a typical
classic type telescope.

00:39:00.810 --> 00:39:02.760
We have two mirrors.

00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:04.800
So one is primary
mirror, which is

00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:09.600
a concave hyperboloid
mirror, and we

00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:14.070
have the secondary mirror, which
is convex hyperboloidal mirror.

00:39:14.070 --> 00:39:18.660
And the size of the mirror, the
diameter is about 2.4 meters.

00:39:18.660 --> 00:39:20.040
The primary mirror.

00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:25.860
And the second one is about,
I guess, 60 centimeters or so.

00:39:25.860 --> 00:39:30.300
And the distance between these
two mirror was 4.94 meters.

00:39:30.300 --> 00:39:33.240
So it's a huge telescope.

00:39:33.240 --> 00:39:37.240
And after extensive
investigation,

00:39:37.240 --> 00:39:43.080
the problem was, actually, the
shape of the primary mirror

00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:45.750
is not same as the
intended shape.

00:39:45.750 --> 00:39:47.680
So the overall shape--

00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:50.190
I mean, the curvature
of the mirror

00:39:50.190 --> 00:39:52.410
was slightly different
than the design.

00:39:52.410 --> 00:39:55.410
And it turns out
that even though--

00:39:55.410 --> 00:39:59.650
actually, the diameter of this
primary lens is 2.4 meter.

00:39:59.650 --> 00:40:04.550
But at the edge, the
difference between the design

00:40:04.550 --> 00:40:07.910
and the actual shape
was only 4 micrometer.

00:40:07.910 --> 00:40:13.110
So it's very small, the
physical difference.

00:40:13.110 --> 00:40:14.940
So just give you an idea.

00:40:14.940 --> 00:40:17.640
So the black hair,
like the Asians,

00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:20.990
like myself, the diameter
of the thick hair

00:40:20.990 --> 00:40:22.860
is about 100 micrometer.

00:40:22.860 --> 00:40:25.560
So 4 micrometer is
very, very small

00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:28.490
distance compared
to the diameter.

00:40:28.490 --> 00:40:32.340
But in general, it introduced
a huge speckle aberration,

00:40:32.340 --> 00:40:35.520
which means ideally you have--

00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:38.220
all these incoming rays
should meet at one point,

00:40:38.220 --> 00:40:41.900
but it has a different
extended focal point.

00:40:41.900 --> 00:40:47.250
So the effect was
too catastrophic.

00:40:47.250 --> 00:40:51.980
So the image of the galaxy
it looked like this.

00:40:51.980 --> 00:40:54.900
But after they fix,
it looked like this.

00:40:54.900 --> 00:41:03.510
So does anyone know how
NASA fixed this problem?

00:41:03.510 --> 00:41:05.100
The telescope was
already in orbit,

00:41:05.100 --> 00:41:07.020
so you cannot take it
back to the ground.

00:41:07.020 --> 00:41:13.310
And to fabricate another big
mirror also need huge resource.

00:41:13.310 --> 00:41:16.740
So how can you fix?

00:41:22.450 --> 00:41:22.950
Yeah.

00:41:22.950 --> 00:41:24.600
So actually what they did is--

00:41:28.100 --> 00:41:29.420
this is huge telescope.

00:41:29.420 --> 00:41:31.130
And they had a focal point.

00:41:31.130 --> 00:41:33.860
And they have different
cameras, because you

00:41:33.860 --> 00:41:38.030
deal with different spectrum,
like visible or the IR or UV.

00:41:38.030 --> 00:41:40.460
And what they did, actually--
and all these cameras

00:41:40.460 --> 00:41:42.600
show the same focal plane.

00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:45.710
So what they did, they actually
sacrificed another camera

00:41:45.710 --> 00:41:48.410
and put another
mirror system here

00:41:48.410 --> 00:41:51.800
to introduce this
speckle aberration

00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:54.380
but in opposite fashion.

00:41:54.380 --> 00:41:58.040
So they kind of canceled
the speckle aberration.

00:41:58.040 --> 00:42:10.780
So I prepared an example in
ZEMAX with the real parameter.

00:42:10.780 --> 00:42:16.000
So this is the intended design
of the Hubble Space Telescope.

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:18.850
And as you can see,
the surface number two

00:42:18.850 --> 00:42:20.440
and surface number
three, they are

00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:22.570
primary and secondary mirror.

00:42:22.570 --> 00:42:24.370
And this is
hyperboloidal mirror.

00:42:24.370 --> 00:42:35.140
So you have-- we have here.

00:42:35.140 --> 00:42:38.480
So conic coefficient.

00:42:38.480 --> 00:42:42.580
And this is the simulation
result if you have--

00:42:42.580 --> 00:42:44.440
simulation result
of image if you

00:42:44.440 --> 00:42:50.050
have the letter F. But
due to the manufacturing

00:42:50.050 --> 00:42:54.020
process, this conic
coefficient was not this one.

00:42:54.020 --> 00:43:01.360
So actually it was
negative 1.02324.

00:43:01.360 --> 00:43:05.180
So overall shape it
doesn't change that much.

00:43:05.180 --> 00:43:10.780
But the image analysis
looks very blurred.

00:43:10.780 --> 00:43:16.430
So that's why we had the
very blurred image of galaxy.

00:43:16.430 --> 00:43:20.105
And that's why you need to
deal with all these aberration

00:43:20.105 --> 00:43:23.410
with this computer software
because you can analyze

00:43:23.410 --> 00:43:25.020
easily and compensate easily.

00:43:28.750 --> 00:43:29.250
OK.

00:43:32.630 --> 00:43:35.610
So last example is optimization.

00:43:35.610 --> 00:43:39.320
So for example, let's
think about this one.

00:43:39.320 --> 00:43:42.860
I want to design some
optical system which

00:43:42.860 --> 00:43:45.540
has three lenses here.

00:43:45.540 --> 00:43:51.590
So these two positive lens
is made by crown glass,

00:43:51.590 --> 00:43:54.830
and this negative lens
is actually flint glass.

00:43:54.830 --> 00:43:56.570
And if you want to
design this one,

00:43:56.570 --> 00:44:01.250
then you have many
parameters you can tune.

00:44:01.250 --> 00:44:04.100
So the radius curvature
of each length--

00:44:04.100 --> 00:44:08.030
so R1/R2, R3/R4, and R5/R6.

00:44:08.030 --> 00:44:12.590
And also the thickness of the
lens, and also the distance

00:44:12.590 --> 00:44:13.760
between the lenses.

00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:16.650
So we have another
six parameters here.

00:44:16.650 --> 00:44:19.850
So you have total 12
parameters you can choose.

00:44:19.850 --> 00:44:26.270
And it's hard to find the best
parameter because you need

00:44:26.270 --> 00:44:30.430
some specification to satisfy.

00:44:30.430 --> 00:44:34.190
So what you do is you can just
run the optimization routine

00:44:34.190 --> 00:44:35.370
here.

00:44:35.370 --> 00:44:40.490
So first process-- first
procedure is select variable.

00:44:40.490 --> 00:44:43.610
As I just described,
you can tune the radius

00:44:43.610 --> 00:44:46.190
of curvature of the
lens and the thickness

00:44:46.190 --> 00:44:48.470
and the distance between lenses.

00:44:48.470 --> 00:44:51.670
So you want to choose the
variable you can tune.

00:44:51.670 --> 00:44:54.230
And this column, you
define the merit function,

00:44:54.230 --> 00:44:57.230
or sometimes it is called object
function or cross function.

00:44:57.230 --> 00:45:02.150
Basically, you just select
what you want to minimize.

00:45:02.150 --> 00:45:04.400
For example, you
want to minimize

00:45:04.400 --> 00:45:07.650
some speckle aberration
for given object point,

00:45:07.650 --> 00:45:12.580
or maybe you can
minimize a spot diagram,

00:45:12.580 --> 00:45:17.470
like size or focus for
different field points.

00:45:17.470 --> 00:45:21.590
And also, you can add some
constraint, like your total--

00:45:21.590 --> 00:45:25.160
physical system
should be like this.

00:45:25.160 --> 00:45:28.580
It cannot longer than
certain distance.

00:45:28.580 --> 00:45:31.760
Or the thickness of the
lens can be constrained due

00:45:31.760 --> 00:45:33.180
to the manufacturing process.

00:45:33.180 --> 00:45:36.440
So you can add some constraints.

00:45:36.440 --> 00:45:40.340
And then what you do is compute
the value of merit function

00:45:40.340 --> 00:45:43.430
with the different
combination of the parameter.

00:45:43.430 --> 00:45:46.940
And this is the automated--
this is iterative process

00:45:46.940 --> 00:45:49.082
so ZEMAX can do it for you.

00:46:03.860 --> 00:46:05.630
So this is the
layout of the system.

00:46:05.630 --> 00:46:08.870
I start with just
three each value--

00:46:08.870 --> 00:46:12.150
I just choose the
random value of this--

00:46:12.150 --> 00:46:13.990
I mean, there's 12 values here.

00:46:13.990 --> 00:46:16.400
So we have the
three lenses here.

00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:18.710
And parameter with
the [INAUDIBLE],,

00:46:18.710 --> 00:46:20.310
they are variables.

00:46:20.310 --> 00:46:22.040
So we have the 12
variables here.

00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:28.910
And this is the result
of the aberration

00:46:28.910 --> 00:46:31.940
at the initial state.

00:46:31.940 --> 00:46:36.490
And the spot diagram
through the focus.

00:46:36.490 --> 00:46:39.660
So as the bottom left figure,
I have four different incident

00:46:39.660 --> 00:46:40.160
angles.

00:46:40.160 --> 00:46:41.500
So 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:46:41.500 --> 00:46:43.440
The different colors here.

00:46:43.440 --> 00:46:47.400
So these four rows
in spot diagram

00:46:47.400 --> 00:46:53.550
means they're corresponding to
this different incident angle.

00:46:53.550 --> 00:46:58.550
And these five column means
I had five different defocus.

00:46:58.550 --> 00:47:02.210
So center one is focused,
and they are slightly

00:47:02.210 --> 00:47:03.530
defocused in front or back.

00:47:07.680 --> 00:47:12.040
I also have the spot diagram
with different wavelength.

00:47:12.040 --> 00:47:15.350
So this one is
about 500 nanometer.

00:47:15.350 --> 00:47:18.500
And it's about 480 nanometer.

00:47:18.500 --> 00:47:21.170
I guess this one is 550 or so.

00:47:21.170 --> 00:47:23.810
50 or so.

00:47:23.810 --> 00:47:31.870
And this is merit function.

00:47:31.870 --> 00:47:34.340
I already defined
the merit function.

00:47:34.340 --> 00:47:38.280
Actually, I used the default
merit function in this case.

00:47:38.280 --> 00:47:40.125
So there are many, many
different parameter

00:47:40.125 --> 00:47:43.146
you can tune, but
the essence is you

00:47:43.146 --> 00:47:45.790
want to minimize some
aberration at the image plane.

00:47:54.240 --> 00:48:01.590
So I'm going to run this
optimization with the auto

00:48:01.590 --> 00:48:03.220
update.

00:48:03.220 --> 00:48:10.370
So you're going to see the
actual shape of this analysis

00:48:10.370 --> 00:48:14.230
for every iteration.

00:48:14.230 --> 00:48:21.650
So we start with this situation,
and I run 50 cycles here.

00:48:21.650 --> 00:48:24.750
So every iteration
is update the system.

00:48:24.750 --> 00:48:28.350
And it actually improve
the performance of system.

00:48:34.550 --> 00:48:35.400
So yeah.

00:48:35.400 --> 00:48:39.490
So after 50 iterations,
this focus is much nicer.

00:48:39.490 --> 00:48:40.500
Focus is much nicer.

00:48:40.500 --> 00:48:43.630
And it doesn't change that much.

00:48:43.630 --> 00:48:45.880
But actually, the
scales are different.

00:48:45.880 --> 00:48:49.210
So actually it improved a lot.

00:48:49.210 --> 00:48:51.260
So after this is
optimized-- so this

00:48:51.260 --> 00:48:53.450
is what usually
optical engineers

00:48:53.450 --> 00:48:58.520
do in industry when you want
to design some optical system.

00:48:58.520 --> 00:49:02.870
But is this the best design?

00:49:02.870 --> 00:49:06.810
I mean, can you say this
is this the best design?

00:49:06.810 --> 00:49:11.260
Probably not because it's
just one of the minimum.

00:49:11.260 --> 00:49:13.440
It can be just global minimum.

00:49:13.440 --> 00:49:20.820
So it's kind of sensitive to
initial value or constraint

00:49:20.820 --> 00:49:21.780
or whatever.

00:49:21.780 --> 00:49:25.230
And also, there are
many, many issues--

00:49:25.230 --> 00:49:27.420
I mean practical issues--
we have to consider.

00:49:27.420 --> 00:49:39.680
For example, in this case,
let's see this third lens.

00:49:39.680 --> 00:49:40.980
The last lens.

00:49:40.980 --> 00:49:47.790
The radius of curvature of
this lens is 60.8 on this one.

00:49:47.790 --> 00:49:53.640
And the second radius
is negative 68.3.

00:49:53.640 --> 00:49:55.860
So they are very
similar, which means

00:49:55.860 --> 00:49:58.020
it looks like convex lens.

00:49:58.020 --> 00:50:01.490
But they are very deep.

00:50:01.490 --> 00:50:04.370
They are slightly different,
but they are not same.

00:50:04.370 --> 00:50:06.230
So if you're on an
assembly system,

00:50:06.230 --> 00:50:09.770
then you need to figure out
which surfaces from surfaces

00:50:09.770 --> 00:50:12.050
shown is the back surface.

00:50:12.050 --> 00:50:14.840
But it's very similar, so
it's hard to figure out.

00:50:14.840 --> 00:50:16.460
So sometimes you
need to consider

00:50:16.460 --> 00:50:19.200
many, many practical issues
because in this case,

00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:23.060
it's not good design
because they are so similar.

00:50:23.060 --> 00:50:25.940
You better have
the plane of convex

00:50:25.940 --> 00:50:27.980
to figure out which
surface is front

00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:30.440
and which surface back surface.

00:50:30.440 --> 00:50:33.170
So ZEMAX does that for you.

00:50:33.170 --> 00:50:34.520
I mean, the optimization.

00:50:34.520 --> 00:50:37.370
But you need to
interpret the result,

00:50:37.370 --> 00:50:42.170
and you need to take into
account many practical issues.

00:50:42.170 --> 00:50:47.080
So basically, which
means it means nothing.

00:50:47.080 --> 00:50:50.730
So that's why we learn
many, many different things.

00:50:50.730 --> 00:50:53.390
I mean, the geometrical optics,
you need to interpret it.

00:50:53.390 --> 00:50:55.625
And you need the
experience and insight.

00:50:58.460 --> 00:50:58.960
Yeah.

00:50:58.960 --> 00:51:01.090
That's what I prepared today.

00:51:01.090 --> 00:51:03.860
PROFESSOR: The last example
that we're going to show

00:51:03.860 --> 00:51:07.500
is on a gradient
refractive index lens.

00:51:07.500 --> 00:51:10.490
So these are a very
interesting type of lenses.

00:51:10.490 --> 00:51:12.340
I have this microphone here.

00:51:12.340 --> 00:51:17.262
Very interesting type of lenses
because the index of refraction

00:51:17.262 --> 00:51:19.470
as opposed to normal lenses
that you're familiar with

00:51:19.470 --> 00:51:21.595
and we've been showing over
and over, which is just

00:51:21.595 --> 00:51:23.780
a piece of glass with a
fixed index of refraction,

00:51:23.780 --> 00:51:26.150
in this case, as
we've been mentioning,

00:51:26.150 --> 00:51:29.570
the index of refraction changes
as a function, in this case,

00:51:29.570 --> 00:51:30.450
of radius.

00:51:30.450 --> 00:51:33.990
So the lens itself, it
looks like this rod here.

00:51:33.990 --> 00:51:35.190
So this is a 3D model.

00:51:35.190 --> 00:51:40.820
Just like a cylinder of glass.

00:51:40.820 --> 00:51:44.230
But its properties, or
its optical properties,

00:51:44.230 --> 00:51:46.560
especially a refractive index,
as you can see, changes.

00:51:46.560 --> 00:51:50.018
And in this case, commercially
available green lenses,

00:51:50.018 --> 00:51:51.560
the way they're
manufactured, they're

00:51:51.560 --> 00:51:54.590
constrained to be with a
parabolic index of refraction

00:51:54.590 --> 00:51:55.230
variation.

00:51:55.230 --> 00:51:58.520
So at the center-- so this is
basically distance from the--

00:51:58.520 --> 00:52:00.530
radial distance is at
the center of the lens.

00:52:00.530 --> 00:52:01.760
Optical axis.

00:52:01.760 --> 00:52:03.500
And this as we
propagate to one--

00:52:03.500 --> 00:52:06.710
as we move to one of the
extremes of the lens.

00:52:06.710 --> 00:52:09.620
And we see that we have the
highest index of refraction

00:52:09.620 --> 00:52:10.580
at the center.

00:52:10.580 --> 00:52:14.160
And then the case
parabolically to the sides.

00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:17.150
And if you can notice here the
variation from top to bottom

00:52:17.150 --> 00:52:18.460
is maybe hard to read.

00:52:18.460 --> 00:52:19.950
But it's very, very small.

00:52:19.950 --> 00:52:24.262
So it goes from something
like 1.6 to 1.59

00:52:24.262 --> 00:52:25.220
or something like that.

00:52:25.220 --> 00:52:29.450
So it's very, very small,
the index variation.

00:52:29.450 --> 00:52:32.630
However, that is enough
to guide the light

00:52:32.630 --> 00:52:34.670
and cause the rays to bend.

00:52:34.670 --> 00:52:36.777
So one thing that
we're going to see here

00:52:36.777 --> 00:52:39.110
is that Snell's law is basically
applied in a little bit

00:52:39.110 --> 00:52:40.400
different way.

00:52:40.400 --> 00:52:43.220
Before, we're interested
in curved surfaces.

00:52:43.220 --> 00:52:46.160
And a ray hitting a
given curved surface

00:52:46.160 --> 00:52:48.050
will bend accordingly
to Snell's law

00:52:48.050 --> 00:52:49.520
and the index of refraction.

00:52:49.520 --> 00:52:54.310
In this case, you see that the
faces of the lens to both sides

00:52:54.310 --> 00:52:55.550
are flat.

00:52:55.550 --> 00:52:58.493
So if the index of these
was basically uniform,

00:52:58.493 --> 00:53:00.910
the plane wave would just go
straight through like a piece

00:53:00.910 --> 00:53:02.772
of glass, like in a window.

00:53:02.772 --> 00:53:05.230
But the fact that this has a
parabolic index of refraction,

00:53:05.230 --> 00:53:08.560
then it makes these
rays to smoothly

00:53:08.560 --> 00:53:12.100
be guided and bent
towards a focus.

00:53:12.100 --> 00:53:13.930
In this case,
on-axis or off-axis.

00:53:13.930 --> 00:53:17.740
This is a 10 degree off-axis
plane wave incidence.

00:53:17.740 --> 00:53:20.230
So what is the nice
thing about these things?

00:53:20.230 --> 00:53:22.180
It's that instead
of only using, you

00:53:22.180 --> 00:53:26.440
can think of the refractive
power of these two surfaces.

00:53:26.440 --> 00:53:29.380
This type of lens
uses the entire volume

00:53:29.380 --> 00:53:32.770
of the lens to guide the rays.

00:53:32.770 --> 00:53:35.740
So therefore, if I
put a screen here and

00:53:35.740 --> 00:53:38.973
see the intersections of all
these rays in that screen--

00:53:38.973 --> 00:53:41.140
this is the spot diagram
that we've been seeing also

00:53:41.140 --> 00:53:42.010
in the other ones--

00:53:42.010 --> 00:53:43.690
we see that for
the on-axis point,

00:53:43.690 --> 00:53:47.513
we have a tight focus,
which typically is smaller.

00:53:47.513 --> 00:53:49.930
In this case, the focal length,
the effective focal length

00:53:49.930 --> 00:53:52.630
of this system is very small.

00:53:52.630 --> 00:53:55.330
So if you try to do this
with a normal refractive

00:53:55.330 --> 00:53:59.200
lens with curved
surfaces, you would

00:53:59.200 --> 00:54:04.010
need to have a really,
really curved lens.

00:54:04.010 --> 00:54:07.210
And as we know from the demos
and from the discussions,

00:54:07.210 --> 00:54:09.310
those type of lenses
will be really aberrated.

00:54:09.310 --> 00:54:11.890
However, these, even though
it has a shorter focal length,

00:54:11.890 --> 00:54:14.710
it still focuses into
a very tight focus

00:54:14.710 --> 00:54:17.440
because it uses, as I
said, the entire volume.

00:54:17.440 --> 00:54:20.470
Now here, this is
the example of coma.

00:54:20.470 --> 00:54:22.570
So if I actually show--

00:54:22.570 --> 00:54:27.880
I can even focus a little bit
into how the rays are coming.

00:54:27.880 --> 00:54:33.370
And we see the similar caustics
that you saw in the demo

00:54:33.370 --> 00:54:35.960
and in the slides before.

00:54:35.960 --> 00:54:38.170
But if we put a
screen here, this

00:54:38.170 --> 00:54:42.460
is the actual shape of the
rays intersecting that plane.

00:54:42.460 --> 00:54:44.880
So these two are the
circles of confusion.

00:54:44.880 --> 00:54:48.690
And just to give
you a preview, this

00:54:48.690 --> 00:54:50.460
is basically for
the on-axis point.

00:54:50.460 --> 00:54:52.440
So this is what
geometrical optics predict.

00:54:52.440 --> 00:54:54.060
The bottom one.

00:54:54.060 --> 00:54:56.160
So the geometrical
optics predict just how

00:54:56.160 --> 00:54:58.370
rays intersect a given plane.

00:54:58.370 --> 00:55:00.510
It doesn't take into
account diffraction

00:55:00.510 --> 00:55:04.627
that we're going to learn in
the next part of the course.

00:55:04.627 --> 00:55:06.960
However, diffraction is very
important in optical system

00:55:06.960 --> 00:55:08.500
because it regulates resolution.

00:55:08.500 --> 00:55:11.070
And many of you have been
asking about numerical aperture

00:55:11.070 --> 00:55:12.960
and how that depends
on resolution

00:55:12.960 --> 00:55:16.350
and what happens changing the
aperture stop and so on and so

00:55:16.350 --> 00:55:17.440
forth.

00:55:17.440 --> 00:55:21.013
Well, this is also very related
to this point spread function

00:55:21.013 --> 00:55:21.930
that you can see here.

00:55:21.930 --> 00:55:24.900
And as you can see,
it's a bright spot,

00:55:24.900 --> 00:55:27.730
and then there's
concentric rings

00:55:27.730 --> 00:55:31.900
which is the way you
can see the diffraction

00:55:31.900 --> 00:55:33.298
effect of that point.

00:55:33.298 --> 00:55:34.590
So this is geometrical version.

00:55:34.590 --> 00:55:37.660
This is the diffraction version
or the more realistic version

00:55:37.660 --> 00:55:39.710
of how light would diffract.

00:55:39.710 --> 00:55:43.480
And in order to
compute this, we'll

00:55:43.480 --> 00:55:45.432
basically need the
math and the tools

00:55:45.432 --> 00:55:47.890
that we're going to learn in
the second part of the course.

00:55:47.890 --> 00:55:51.940
But this is just giving you the
type of science and analysis

00:55:51.940 --> 00:55:55.490
that we could do
in this software.

00:55:55.490 --> 00:55:57.830
So any questions before--

00:55:57.830 --> 00:55:59.757
because we're going to
break, right, George?

00:55:59.757 --> 00:56:00.840
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: Yeah.

00:56:03.880 --> 00:56:05.630
PROFESSOR: Any questions
before the break?

00:56:11.610 --> 00:56:13.735
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: I
think it's time to continue.

00:56:21.260 --> 00:56:27.418
Before I move on, are
there any questions about--

00:56:27.418 --> 00:56:27.960
I don't know.

00:56:27.960 --> 00:56:28.585
About anything.

00:56:28.585 --> 00:56:33.300
About the homeworks, about
the lectures, about imaging,

00:56:33.300 --> 00:56:34.320
about focusing?

00:56:38.280 --> 00:56:39.530
A bit of a milestone, I guess.

00:56:39.530 --> 00:56:41.160
I don't believe in quizzes.

00:56:41.160 --> 00:56:43.220
Actually, I hate giving exams.

00:56:43.220 --> 00:56:45.470
But I have to produce grades.

00:56:45.470 --> 00:56:47.780
The register asks for grades.

00:56:47.780 --> 00:56:53.390
So the accepted, I guess,
established way is with exams.

00:56:53.390 --> 00:56:55.130
But anyway.

00:56:55.130 --> 00:56:57.900
And I also hate reviews
because of the same reason

00:56:57.900 --> 00:57:00.290
because a review
suggests somehow

00:57:00.290 --> 00:57:01.760
that the quiz is important.

00:57:01.760 --> 00:57:03.260
Of course, the quiz
is not important

00:57:03.260 --> 00:57:06.410
except for the register.

00:57:06.410 --> 00:57:08.420
The only significance,
perhaps, exams

00:57:08.420 --> 00:57:12.048
have is that they really
force you to study.

00:57:12.048 --> 00:57:14.340
I mean, if you didn't have
an exam, then you would say,

00:57:14.340 --> 00:57:15.770
well, maybe I'll study later.

00:57:15.770 --> 00:57:17.930
Maybe I will study
in the summer.

00:57:17.930 --> 00:57:21.840
When I go out water
skiing, I can study optics

00:57:21.840 --> 00:57:24.620
while I water ski.

00:57:24.620 --> 00:57:28.830
But anyway.

00:57:28.830 --> 00:57:31.380
So I try to--

00:57:31.380 --> 00:57:34.290
in my classes, I try
to de-emphasize exams

00:57:34.290 --> 00:57:35.250
as much as possible.

00:57:35.250 --> 00:57:37.598
And the assumption is that
if throughout the course

00:57:37.598 --> 00:57:39.390
of the class you have
learned the material,

00:57:39.390 --> 00:57:41.910
then you will do
well in the exam.

00:57:41.910 --> 00:57:43.470
Whereas to do the
opposite, to try

00:57:43.470 --> 00:57:48.480
to satisfy the needs of the exam
is very limited because then,

00:57:48.480 --> 00:57:49.780
what you get out of it?

00:57:49.780 --> 00:57:53.290
You're wasting your time.

00:57:53.290 --> 00:57:55.900
So that's why I try
to not mention exams.

00:57:55.900 --> 00:57:58.660
As far as I can help it,
I try not to mention them.

00:57:58.660 --> 00:57:59.620
But I know--

00:57:59.620 --> 00:58:01.100
I've been a student also.

00:58:01.100 --> 00:58:04.930
At the time I would also be
very worried about exams.

00:58:04.930 --> 00:58:05.430
Anyway.

00:58:05.430 --> 00:58:06.290
So this is the time.

00:58:06.290 --> 00:58:10.330
Is there any sort of--

00:58:10.330 --> 00:58:11.120
whatever.

00:58:11.120 --> 00:58:12.280
Review questions or--

00:58:31.090 --> 00:58:32.910
OK.

00:58:32.910 --> 00:58:38.760
I'm going to count
to from 3 down.

00:58:38.760 --> 00:58:46.605
3, 2, how they do
in auctions, 1.

00:58:49.230 --> 00:58:51.340
You can still interrupt.

00:58:51.340 --> 00:58:54.960
Also, we have the class forum.

00:58:54.960 --> 00:58:58.300
I mean the online chat room
or whatever it's called.

00:58:58.300 --> 00:59:00.350
The forum the call it.

00:59:00.350 --> 00:59:03.850
So of course, you can
post questions there.

00:59:03.850 --> 00:59:05.440
I will be diligently checking.

00:59:08.270 --> 00:59:11.332
Also, I sent an
announcement by email.

00:59:11.332 --> 00:59:12.540
You may have not seen it yet.

00:59:12.540 --> 00:59:16.020
But we've posted
some solved problems.

00:59:16.020 --> 00:59:19.390
Actually, the problems have
been posted since Monday.

00:59:19.390 --> 00:59:21.858
So the problems are solved.

00:59:21.858 --> 00:59:23.400
So you don't really
have to-- so this

00:59:23.400 --> 00:59:25.170
is the homework for next week.

00:59:25.170 --> 00:59:27.940
You don't have to actually turn
in the homework on the quiz

00:59:27.940 --> 00:59:28.440
day.

00:59:28.440 --> 00:59:29.970
That would have been cruel.

00:59:29.970 --> 00:59:32.980
But we actually gave you
some solved problems.

00:59:32.980 --> 00:59:34.620
So you can go over them.

00:59:34.620 --> 00:59:37.860
And of course the
recommendation is

00:59:37.860 --> 00:59:41.060
to really pretend that you
don't have the solution.

00:59:41.060 --> 00:59:43.020
Try to solve it yourself.

00:59:43.020 --> 00:59:44.580
And then check it--

00:59:44.580 --> 00:59:47.490
check your solution
against ours.

00:59:47.490 --> 00:59:50.610
And of course, you don't have
to turn in your solution.

00:59:50.610 --> 00:59:52.620
And I'll stop talking
about the exam

00:59:52.620 --> 00:59:56.810
now, unless someone has
a question now or later.

00:59:56.810 --> 00:59:58.550
So Pepe already
gave an introduction

00:59:58.550 --> 01:00:04.820
to the topic of gradient
index or GRIN optics.

01:00:04.820 --> 01:00:07.280
And he mentioned that the
motivation is basically

01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:11.660
that if you can focus
the light by using

01:00:11.660 --> 01:00:15.950
a non-uniform material,
a material whose

01:00:15.950 --> 01:00:20.570
index of refraction is variable,
perhaps you can get away

01:00:20.570 --> 01:00:23.600
by also using a material
whose surface is flat.

01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:27.080
So you don't have to use this
awkward spherical shape that we

01:00:27.080 --> 01:00:28.400
know from everyday optics.

01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:30.230
Maybe you can have
something that

01:00:30.230 --> 01:00:34.880
looks like a slab or a plate.

01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:38.100
And nevertheless, this
flat-looking plate

01:00:38.100 --> 01:00:40.850
might have the ability
to focus light.

01:00:40.850 --> 01:00:43.170
So the way you can
do-- first of all,

01:00:43.170 --> 01:00:44.430
can you do this kind of thing?

01:00:44.430 --> 01:00:47.910
Can you make an element with
variable index or the fraction.

01:00:47.910 --> 01:00:50.490
So there's two-- well,
there's many ways.

01:00:50.490 --> 01:00:53.840
But in industry, in
manufacturing practices,

01:00:53.840 --> 01:00:55.940
there's two ways
that are being used.

01:00:55.940 --> 01:00:58.690
And I will describe them.

01:00:58.690 --> 01:01:02.150
One is called ion exchange.

01:01:02.150 --> 01:01:05.440
And what they do is
they take a glass rod,

01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:08.560
which is doped with a
certain kind of ions--

01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:12.280
typically, they use
sodium in the glass rod.

01:01:12.280 --> 01:01:15.820
Then they have the glass meld
at the very high temperature,

01:01:15.820 --> 01:01:18.100
of course, with a
different kind of ion.

01:01:18.100 --> 01:01:19.810
Typically lithium.

01:01:19.810 --> 01:01:26.450
And what happens is they
slowly dip the glass rod

01:01:26.450 --> 01:01:28.240
into the glass meld.

01:01:28.240 --> 01:01:30.950
And over a period of several
hours, what's happens

01:01:30.950 --> 01:01:35.690
is the lithium ions, they kick
out some of the sodium ions

01:01:35.690 --> 01:01:36.710
from the glass rod.

01:01:36.710 --> 01:01:38.390
They basically
penetrate the rod,

01:01:38.390 --> 01:01:42.357
and they kick out some
of the sodium ions.

01:01:42.357 --> 01:01:43.940
But of course, the
index of refraction

01:01:43.940 --> 01:01:48.320
depends on what kind of ions
you have inside of the glass.

01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:52.070
And also, because the
ions, they propagate

01:01:52.070 --> 01:01:54.230
at a finite speed,
what will happen

01:01:54.230 --> 01:01:56.990
here is in the exterior
of the glass rod,

01:01:56.990 --> 01:01:58.490
you get a lot of ion exchange.

01:01:58.490 --> 01:02:00.470
So the index changes a lot.

01:02:00.470 --> 01:02:03.230
But near the center, if
you get your timing right,

01:02:03.230 --> 01:02:06.050
near the center you don't
get any exchange at all.

01:02:06.050 --> 01:02:07.730
So you basically have--

01:02:07.730 --> 01:02:10.730
in the center you
only have sodium ions.

01:02:10.730 --> 01:02:13.430
Near the exterior to give
both sodium and lithium.

01:02:13.430 --> 01:02:16.190
So you can get a situation
where the index of refraction

01:02:16.190 --> 01:02:21.750
is different in the center
than it is at the edge.

01:02:21.750 --> 01:02:24.310
And then what they
do, of course,

01:02:24.310 --> 01:02:25.860
is after they
finish this process,

01:02:25.860 --> 01:02:31.990
they chop this glass
rod into slabs.

01:02:31.990 --> 01:02:35.600
And then each one of those
slabs is to become a GRIN lens.

01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:37.800
And as I said before,
they do it typically

01:02:37.800 --> 01:02:41.250
so that the index is
higher in the center

01:02:41.250 --> 01:02:44.910
and lower at the edges.

01:02:44.910 --> 01:02:47.170
So this kind of thing I
will do in detail later.

01:02:47.170 --> 01:02:51.120
But if you look at
it in cross-section,

01:02:51.120 --> 01:02:54.540
it focuses like so
if you illuminate it

01:02:54.540 --> 01:03:00.090
with parallel bundle of rays.

01:03:00.090 --> 01:03:01.950
You can think of the
index of refraction

01:03:01.950 --> 01:03:04.740
as an attraction
of sorts for rays.

01:03:04.740 --> 01:03:08.070
So the ray that enters at
the lower index, it gets

01:03:08.070 --> 01:03:09.750
attracted by the high index.

01:03:09.750 --> 01:03:11.040
It bends.

01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:13.620
And as a result, by the
time the rays come out,

01:03:13.620 --> 01:03:16.340
they actually come out
as a focusing bundle.

01:03:16.340 --> 01:03:21.230
So you can use this
element to focus light.

01:03:21.230 --> 01:03:25.020
So just like a lens, but
it has a flat surface.

01:03:25.020 --> 01:03:30.690
And because the ionic change
is actually diffusion-driven--

01:03:30.690 --> 01:03:33.150
I don't want to go into the
mathematics of diffusion.

01:03:33.150 --> 01:03:40.050
But it turns out that if you get
the specific form of the index

01:03:40.050 --> 01:03:41.880
of refraction that
you get in this case,

01:03:41.880 --> 01:03:44.860
it's quadratic or parabolic.

01:03:44.860 --> 01:03:47.320
So it is maximum in the center.

01:03:47.320 --> 01:03:50.850
And then it drops
as the square--

01:03:50.850 --> 01:03:59.730
as the radius square, where r
is the radius in the slab times

01:03:59.730 --> 01:04:02.010
some coefficient alpha.

01:04:02.010 --> 01:04:05.760
And I will show in a second
that this coefficient alpha

01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:09.360
and the thickness of the
lens, the product of the two

01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:11.770
actually specifies
the focal length.

01:04:11.770 --> 01:04:13.350
So this looks like
a funny formula.

01:04:13.350 --> 01:04:15.930
But if you think
about it, alpha must

01:04:15.930 --> 01:04:19.560
have dimensions that
are inverse distance

01:04:19.560 --> 01:04:24.090
square so that the product
alpha times r squared

01:04:24.090 --> 01:04:25.740
is non-dimensional.

01:04:25.740 --> 01:04:26.920
And d is distance.

01:04:26.920 --> 01:04:29.490
So therefore, the units
here are distance.

01:04:29.490 --> 01:04:32.490
So indeed, the quantity
over there is the distance.

01:04:32.490 --> 01:04:35.920
It is the focal length.

01:04:35.920 --> 01:04:37.890
So let's see now why
this is the case.

01:04:41.650 --> 01:04:44.500
So I guess we've done
it several times.

01:04:44.500 --> 01:04:46.240
So you must be
tired of it by now.

01:04:46.240 --> 01:04:49.470
I just lost my--

01:04:49.470 --> 01:04:50.970
oh, maybe I'll use
the-- oh, thanks.

01:04:54.540 --> 01:04:56.222
I also must not forget this.

01:04:59.460 --> 01:05:00.500
OK.

01:05:00.500 --> 01:05:04.220
So in typical fashion, we
will use Fermat's principle

01:05:04.220 --> 01:05:07.410
in order to calculate
what is happening here.

01:05:07.410 --> 01:05:11.960
So Fermat says that if you--

01:05:11.960 --> 01:05:12.965
here is my element.

01:05:16.130 --> 01:05:21.360
And I have two rays that
both started at infinity.

01:05:21.360 --> 01:05:29.360
So the rays share their
origin, the starting point.

01:05:29.360 --> 01:05:33.680
And then my desire here,
my intended outcome,

01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:36.510
is that these two rays
meet because I want

01:05:36.510 --> 01:05:39.590
the element to focus the light.

01:05:39.590 --> 01:05:46.340
So Fermat says that the optical
path length here on-axis

01:05:46.340 --> 01:05:49.500
and the optical path
length out here off-axis,

01:05:49.500 --> 01:05:50.780
they must be equal.

01:05:50.780 --> 01:05:53.040
Because the rays started
at the same point,

01:05:53.040 --> 01:05:56.270
they end up at the same point,
the optical path lengths

01:05:56.270 --> 01:05:57.752
must be equal.

01:05:57.752 --> 01:05:59.210
So what is the
optical path length?

01:05:59.210 --> 01:06:03.570
So this derivation here is very
highly handwaving and very,

01:06:03.570 --> 01:06:05.150
very inaccurate.

01:06:05.150 --> 01:06:06.530
But bear with me.

01:06:06.530 --> 01:06:09.080
In the next half
hour, I will tell you

01:06:09.080 --> 01:06:12.200
how this calculation
can be done exactly.

01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:14.240
But for now, this is kind
of an interesting way

01:06:14.240 --> 01:06:16.540
to think about GRIN,
so we'll do it anyway.

01:06:16.540 --> 01:06:17.870
It's also in the book.

01:06:17.870 --> 01:06:20.720
So you don't really have
to copy my derivation here.

01:06:20.720 --> 01:06:22.530
You already have
it in two places.

01:06:22.530 --> 01:06:25.180
One is in the book, and
the other is the notes.

01:06:25.180 --> 01:06:28.550
So maybe you can just
look at it and don't

01:06:28.550 --> 01:06:30.770
bother to write it down.

01:06:30.770 --> 01:06:32.060
So let's compare the two rays.

01:06:32.060 --> 01:06:36.980
Let's compare the on-axis ray,
which basically goes straight.

01:06:36.980 --> 01:06:39.790
This is the optical axis.

01:06:39.790 --> 01:06:45.250
And the off-axis ray, which
as Pepe already mentioned,

01:06:45.250 --> 01:06:47.650
the off-axis ray will actually
do something like this.

01:06:47.650 --> 01:06:48.690
It will bend.

01:06:48.690 --> 01:06:50.940
And then, of course, after
it comes out in free space,

01:06:50.940 --> 01:06:52.330
it will go straight.

01:06:52.330 --> 01:06:53.620
We know that for sure.

01:06:53.620 --> 01:06:56.590
But inside the gradient index
medium, the ray will bend.

01:06:56.590 --> 01:07:05.390
It will follow a continuous
kind of trajectory.

01:07:05.390 --> 01:07:07.740
This is also counterintuitive
because in our experience

01:07:07.740 --> 01:07:09.550
light rays go straight.

01:07:09.550 --> 01:07:10.960
But such is life.

01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:13.720
Physics sometimes have
unexpected outcomes.

01:07:13.720 --> 01:07:16.450
If you put a ray in a
gradient index medium,

01:07:16.450 --> 01:07:20.900
indeed it will bend onto
a curved trajectory.

01:07:20.900 --> 01:07:22.850
So let's put some notation here.

01:07:22.850 --> 01:07:24.850
So we'll call this r.

01:07:24.850 --> 01:07:28.320
This is the radial direction.

01:07:28.320 --> 01:07:30.235
We'll call this d.

01:07:30.235 --> 01:07:33.190
This is the thickness
of the GRIN.

01:07:33.190 --> 01:07:34.420
We'll call this f.

01:07:34.420 --> 01:07:35.920
This is the focal length.

01:07:39.090 --> 01:07:43.050
And for the sake
of this derivation,

01:07:43.050 --> 01:07:45.570
let me actually redraw it.

01:07:45.570 --> 01:07:46.800
I will redraw it.

01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:49.080
Forgive me.

01:07:49.080 --> 01:07:53.208
I just want to emphasize
this caricature.

01:07:59.910 --> 01:08:03.460
So we'll actually
neglect this distance.

01:08:03.460 --> 01:08:06.480
This space over there, I
will pretend it's not there.

01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:10.580
And this is consistent with
a paraxial approximation.

01:08:10.580 --> 01:08:15.930
Here is r, here is d
again, and here is f.

01:08:15.930 --> 01:08:17.160
And that's the optical axis.

01:08:22.760 --> 01:08:23.260
OK.

01:08:29.130 --> 01:08:31.510
So well, let's do, first
of all, the optical path

01:08:31.510 --> 01:08:35.800
length for the on-axis ray.

01:08:35.800 --> 01:08:39.479
The optical path
length equals the index

01:08:39.479 --> 01:08:43.810
times the distance integrated
over the path of the ray.

01:08:43.810 --> 01:08:49.340
So this would equal the
index at radius equal 0.

01:08:49.340 --> 01:08:52.430
That is the index over
here at the center

01:08:52.430 --> 01:08:55.410
of the lens times the
thickness of the lens

01:08:55.410 --> 01:08:58.040
plus the focal length.

01:08:58.040 --> 01:09:01.399
So of course, outside the lens,
the index we assume to be 1.

01:09:01.399 --> 01:09:05.270
You can have an imaginary lens,
but let's not do that now.

01:09:05.270 --> 01:09:06.790
So this is where it comes from.

01:09:06.790 --> 01:09:07.630
AUDIENCE: Excuse me.

01:09:07.630 --> 01:09:08.630
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: Yeah?

01:09:08.630 --> 01:09:10.380
AUDIENCE: According
to Fermat's principle,

01:09:10.380 --> 01:09:13.340
it says that the ray
travels in such a way

01:09:13.340 --> 01:09:17.300
that it tries to
minimize the path.

01:09:17.300 --> 01:09:22.359
So why does the ray goes from
lower index to higher index?

01:09:22.359 --> 01:09:25.680
Means if it goes into
higher index material,

01:09:25.680 --> 01:09:29.020
actually it is increasing
its optical path length?

01:09:29.020 --> 01:09:30.020
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: Ah.

01:09:30.020 --> 01:09:32.270
But it will bend.

01:09:32.270 --> 01:09:33.950
That's what Snell says.

01:09:33.950 --> 01:09:38.210
It will bend so that the total
path length actually decreases.

01:09:43.423 --> 01:09:45.840
Did I answer your question or
did you have something else?

01:09:45.840 --> 01:09:48.240
AUDIENCE: I think--
well, I don't know,

01:09:48.240 --> 01:09:52.120
but maybe the answer to your
question is that although--

01:09:52.120 --> 01:09:55.630
I think what he says is
that it will actually

01:09:55.630 --> 01:10:00.190
travel through a longer
optical path in the medium

01:10:00.190 --> 01:10:02.650
because it goes into
the bigger index.

01:10:02.650 --> 01:10:03.650
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: Ah.

01:10:03.650 --> 01:10:04.150
OK.

01:10:04.150 --> 01:10:04.780
I see.

01:10:04.780 --> 01:10:08.050
AUDIENCE: But I think
that's counteracted

01:10:08.050 --> 01:10:12.280
by the extra that would be
outside, isn't it, in the air,

01:10:12.280 --> 01:10:12.780
I think.

01:10:12.780 --> 01:10:13.210
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: Yeah.

01:10:13.210 --> 01:10:15.277
And you will see that
in the derivation.

01:10:15.277 --> 01:10:17.360
Because it will have to
go through this hypotenuse

01:10:17.360 --> 01:10:19.750
over here, it will
actually-- yeah.

01:10:19.750 --> 01:10:23.110
So the overall path
is actually minimized.

01:10:23.110 --> 01:10:25.487
And this is the only
way it can be minimized.

01:10:28.340 --> 01:10:28.840
OK.

01:10:28.840 --> 01:10:32.620
So lo and behold, then,
let's do what you just said.

01:10:32.620 --> 01:10:39.230
So what about the
ray that arrives

01:10:39.230 --> 01:10:41.240
at the higher elevation?

01:10:41.240 --> 01:10:43.470
So here I'm going
to cheat big time.

01:10:43.470 --> 01:10:45.980
I'm going to pretend
that all of this--

01:10:45.980 --> 01:10:48.530
the ray bends, of course.

01:10:48.530 --> 01:10:52.490
But I'm going to pretend that
throughout all this travel

01:10:52.490 --> 01:10:56.900
here, the ray sees the
same index of refraction.

01:10:56.900 --> 01:11:00.450
This is a gross approximation,
but I will do it.

01:11:00.450 --> 01:11:02.120
So therefore, this is--

01:11:02.120 --> 01:11:05.780
so n0, another name for it is--

01:11:05.780 --> 01:11:07.190
it is also equal to n max.

01:11:10.190 --> 01:11:14.448
The optical part for
n1 will be equal n max.

01:11:14.448 --> 01:11:18.690
1 minus alpha r
square over 2, which

01:11:18.690 --> 01:11:22.440
is the index of refraction
at the elevated position.

01:11:22.440 --> 01:11:24.870
And then, as you
pointed out, it will

01:11:24.870 --> 01:11:28.050
go through this increased
distance, which is

01:11:28.050 --> 01:11:32.760
the hypotenuse of the triangle.

01:11:32.760 --> 01:11:37.450
So it is really r
squared plus f squared.

01:11:37.450 --> 01:11:42.840
So again, I pretended that
this r and this r are the same.

01:11:42.840 --> 01:11:45.970
I want to emphasize that
this is an approximation.

01:11:45.970 --> 01:11:47.680
I'm cheating.

01:11:47.680 --> 01:11:50.340
OK.

01:11:50.340 --> 01:11:52.288
The next is actually
easier from now on.

01:11:52.288 --> 01:11:54.580
All I'm going to do-- and
the reason I'm going to do it

01:11:54.580 --> 01:11:56.070
is to remind you.

01:11:56.070 --> 01:11:58.650
I'm going to do the paraxial
approximation, which basically

01:11:58.650 --> 01:12:01.360
says that r is much less than f.

01:12:01.360 --> 01:12:06.720
So that means that square
root can be written as--

01:12:09.480 --> 01:12:12.000
I pull the f outside.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:17.040
1 plus r square over f
square approximately equal f1

01:12:17.040 --> 01:12:20.730
plus r square over 2f square.

01:12:20.730 --> 01:12:31.670
And this is actually equal
to f plus r square over 2f.

01:12:36.100 --> 01:12:42.430
So now let's write down
Fermat's principle.

01:12:42.430 --> 01:12:48.140
Fermat says that OPL 0
must be equal to OPL 1.

01:12:48.140 --> 01:12:56.650
So OPL 0 was n max
times d plus f.

01:12:56.650 --> 01:13:00.040
And OPL 1 was--

01:13:00.040 --> 01:13:02.890
again, if you look at
it from this equation,

01:13:02.890 --> 01:13:07.540
OPL 1 was this expression
times d, of course.

01:13:07.540 --> 01:13:09.670
I forgot to put the d here.

01:13:09.670 --> 01:13:12.190
Times this distance.

01:13:12.190 --> 01:13:21.010
So it is equal to n max 1 minus
alpha r square over 2 times

01:13:21.010 --> 01:13:25.510
d plus f plus--

01:13:25.510 --> 01:13:31.060
what was it-- r square over 2f.

01:13:31.060 --> 01:13:32.670
Now a number of
things will cancel.

01:13:32.670 --> 01:13:36.020
This will eat this one.

01:13:36.020 --> 01:13:39.750
This will eat this one.

01:13:39.750 --> 01:13:47.490
And all that is left is
that n max times alpha r

01:13:47.490 --> 01:13:56.130
square over 2d with a minus sign
plus r square over 2f equals 0.

01:13:56.130 --> 01:13:58.920
And now we can see that
the quadratic dependence

01:13:58.920 --> 01:14:01.080
for the index of
refraction that we draw

01:14:01.080 --> 01:14:04.290
is convenient because the
same quadratic came out

01:14:04.290 --> 01:14:07.570
of the paraxial approximation
of the square root.

01:14:07.570 --> 01:14:10.830
So I can just cancel
the two quadratics.

01:14:10.830 --> 01:14:13.470
And the twos also cancel.

01:14:13.470 --> 01:14:16.950
And I get that f
equals the inverse

01:14:16.950 --> 01:14:23.690
of all of that, 1 over n
max times alpha times d.

01:14:23.690 --> 01:14:26.600
This is how we find the
focal length of the GRIN.

01:14:26.600 --> 01:14:29.420
So this appears a little bit
mysterious what happened here.

01:14:29.420 --> 01:14:31.430
How did I pull this
out of the hat?

01:14:31.430 --> 01:14:32.640
Well, what it really means--

01:14:32.640 --> 01:14:35.180
the fact that this
has a solution

01:14:35.180 --> 01:14:39.260
means that this element
actually succeeds in focusing.

01:14:39.260 --> 01:14:40.650
What I mean is the following.

01:14:40.650 --> 01:14:42.800
Suppose that what came
out of this equation

01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:45.830
was not the nice quadratic
that canceled, but suppose

01:14:45.830 --> 01:14:46.950
I got something like this.

01:14:46.950 --> 01:14:51.680
Suppose I got minus n max
alpha r cube, for example,

01:14:51.680 --> 01:14:58.820
over 2 times d plus r
square over 2f equals 0.

01:14:58.820 --> 01:15:01.130
Well, if this is what I had
gotten, I'm out of luck.

01:15:01.130 --> 01:15:03.170
This is not a proper lens.

01:15:03.170 --> 01:15:04.940
So what I'm trying
to say is suppose

01:15:04.940 --> 01:15:09.020
that I made the GRIN
with a cubic dependence

01:15:09.020 --> 01:15:11.410
of the index of refraction,
another quadratic.

01:15:11.410 --> 01:15:14.030
Then this is the question I
would have arrived instead.

01:15:14.030 --> 01:15:16.580
Now I cannot cancel r anymore.

01:15:16.580 --> 01:15:21.140
So it means that each ray goes
to a different focal point.

01:15:21.140 --> 01:15:23.390
So therefore, this
element does not focus.

01:15:23.390 --> 01:15:27.560
So this would not
be a good lens.

01:15:27.560 --> 01:15:29.210
Actually, the cubic
dependence has

01:15:29.210 --> 01:15:31.250
some other interesting
properties,

01:15:31.250 --> 01:15:37.760
but these are perhaps for
a more advanced class.

01:15:37.760 --> 01:15:39.380
Nevertheless, the
quadratic dependence

01:15:39.380 --> 01:15:41.690
is very convenient
because as you can see,

01:15:41.690 --> 01:15:43.010
it drops out of here.

01:15:43.010 --> 01:15:45.500
It means that I have
a unique focal length

01:15:45.500 --> 01:15:47.960
at which all the
rays focus, at least

01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:49.610
in the paraxial approximation.

01:15:52.230 --> 01:15:56.100
So that is the story
of the quadratic GRIN,

01:15:56.100 --> 01:16:01.460
how it comes about, and how
we derive its focal length.

01:16:01.460 --> 01:16:05.000
And I should also say that
even though my derivation here

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:10.500
was cheating,
basically the way I

01:16:10.500 --> 01:16:14.840
cheated is I assumed that d,
the thickness of the lens,

01:16:14.840 --> 01:16:16.250
is also very small.

01:16:16.250 --> 01:16:19.880
So it is very similar to
the thin lens approximation.

01:16:19.880 --> 01:16:23.090
Nevertheless, this equation
is actually true, even

01:16:23.090 --> 01:16:24.590
for thicker lenses.

01:16:24.590 --> 01:16:27.280
So that's kind of interesting.

01:16:27.280 --> 01:16:29.170
OK.

01:16:29.170 --> 01:16:32.380
The second way people make
GRIN optics is actually

01:16:32.380 --> 01:16:35.730
a combination of
melding and grinding.

01:16:35.730 --> 01:16:40.240
And the way they do that
results in a different profile

01:16:40.240 --> 01:16:46.450
that now the index of refraction
varies along the longitudinal--

01:16:46.450 --> 01:16:49.050
the axial dimension.

01:16:49.050 --> 01:16:51.460
So what does this mean?

01:16:51.460 --> 01:16:54.790
What they do first is
they start with a stack

01:16:54.790 --> 01:16:58.630
of glasses of different
indices over refraction.

01:16:58.630 --> 01:17:04.210
So here and in the rest of this
lecture, the sort of darkness

01:17:04.210 --> 01:17:06.020
indicates index of refraction.

01:17:06.020 --> 01:17:09.850
So dark gray means high index.

01:17:09.850 --> 01:17:12.520
Light gray means low index.

01:17:12.520 --> 01:17:14.470
So they stack them.

01:17:14.470 --> 01:17:17.050
Then they meld them,
which basically

01:17:17.050 --> 01:17:21.810
means that they mold and meld.

01:17:25.480 --> 01:17:29.400
So after they meld
them, basically

01:17:29.400 --> 01:17:31.300
the index of refraction,
the variation

01:17:31.300 --> 01:17:37.000
becomes kind of continuous
because as they meld,

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.680
the different indices will
kind of diffuse into each.

01:17:39.680 --> 01:17:42.880
So you will get a
quasi-continuous variational

01:17:42.880 --> 01:17:43.930
index.

01:17:43.930 --> 01:17:47.290
And the final thing they
do is they actually polish.

01:17:47.290 --> 01:17:50.290
This stack that they've got with
a continuous index variation,

01:17:50.290 --> 01:17:51.913
they polish it.

01:17:51.913 --> 01:17:53.830
So now this thing actually
has two properties.

01:17:53.830 --> 01:17:55.950
First of all, it is a lens
in a traditional sense

01:17:55.950 --> 01:18:02.070
because it has a spherical
surface, so it focuses

01:18:02.070 --> 01:18:04.080
by virtue of refraction.

01:18:04.080 --> 01:18:07.390
But in addition, it has
an axial index profile.

01:18:07.390 --> 01:18:10.150
So here the
motivation is actually

01:18:10.150 --> 01:18:14.550
a little bit different than what
Pepe and I described earlier.

01:18:14.550 --> 01:18:18.550
So clearly I did not end up
with a slab-looking element.

01:18:18.550 --> 01:18:20.640
I still have a curvature.

01:18:20.640 --> 01:18:22.620
But the motivation is different.

01:18:22.620 --> 01:18:25.500
It's a little bit similar to--

01:18:25.500 --> 01:18:27.240
in the previous
lecture I think we

01:18:27.240 --> 01:18:30.780
mentioned something called the
Smith correction or the Smith

01:18:30.780 --> 01:18:32.220
telescope.

01:18:32.220 --> 01:18:33.900
So it's a very
similar motivation.

01:18:33.900 --> 01:18:40.200
If you take a
uniform index sphere,

01:18:40.200 --> 01:18:42.870
we saw this a couple of
times that in general, this

01:18:42.870 --> 01:18:49.230
produces an aberrated image,
even if it is oriented

01:18:49.230 --> 01:18:49.840
properly.

01:18:49.840 --> 01:18:53.340
This is supposed to be a
plane or convex lens oriented

01:18:53.340 --> 01:18:54.750
in the correct way.

01:18:54.750 --> 01:18:58.140
That is the plane wave goes
with the spherical surface.

01:18:58.140 --> 01:19:00.150
But still, this
does not completely

01:19:00.150 --> 01:19:01.160
cancel the aberration.

01:19:01.160 --> 01:19:04.390
There is still some residue.

01:19:04.390 --> 01:19:09.320
So what do you do then, if you
modify the index of refraction

01:19:09.320 --> 01:19:15.400
in the interior of the surface,
what happens is this ray--

01:19:15.400 --> 01:19:17.650
let's take the
paraxial ray over here.

01:19:17.650 --> 01:19:22.240
It hits at a relatively high
index, whereas this ray,

01:19:22.240 --> 01:19:25.300
it hits at a
relatively lower index.

01:19:25.300 --> 01:19:27.220
What this means,
if you want to look

01:19:27.220 --> 01:19:29.770
at it from the geometrical
optics point of view--

01:19:29.770 --> 01:19:32.740
there's also a wave optics point
of view that is interesting,

01:19:32.740 --> 01:19:34.855
but from the geometrical
optics point of view,

01:19:34.855 --> 01:19:37.420
it means that the
Snell's law of refraction

01:19:37.420 --> 01:19:42.610
here will be milder for
this ray than for this ray.

01:19:42.610 --> 01:19:46.570
Therefore, this ray, who's
used to focus kind of violently

01:19:46.570 --> 01:19:49.300
and produce a spherical
aberration here,

01:19:49.300 --> 01:19:52.570
now it will be pulled outwards.

01:19:52.570 --> 01:19:55.510
And therefore, it
will be forced to go

01:19:55.510 --> 01:20:00.130
through the proper focal point
over here as the paraxial lens.

01:20:00.130 --> 01:20:04.730
So this is a clever way to
fix spherical aberration.

01:20:04.730 --> 01:20:06.520
And I don't know who
invented this first.

01:20:06.520 --> 01:20:09.280
I believe-- and maybe, Colin,
you again correct with this.

01:20:09.280 --> 01:20:13.270
I believe in was Duncan
Moore at the Rochester

01:20:13.270 --> 01:20:17.520
who came up with
this particular--

01:20:17.520 --> 01:20:19.450
at least I've seen
a paper of his

01:20:19.450 --> 01:20:21.910
which is as old as
I am, 1971, that

01:20:21.910 --> 01:20:24.765
discusses this optimization.

01:20:30.250 --> 01:20:35.210
So in order to solve the
basic principles of GRINs,

01:20:35.210 --> 01:20:38.125
I would like to spend
a little bit of time--

01:20:38.125 --> 01:20:39.500
I don't think
we'll finish today.

01:20:39.500 --> 01:20:44.530
We'll probably have to leak into
next Wednesday after the quiz.

01:20:44.530 --> 01:20:50.350
But I'll get us started on, how
do we properly compute things

01:20:50.350 --> 01:20:51.220
like index?

01:20:51.220 --> 01:20:57.190
I mean, like focal length for
a gradient index structure.

01:20:57.190 --> 01:21:01.180
So we'd like to ask the
question more generally.

01:21:01.180 --> 01:21:06.250
If I have a medium whose
index of refraction

01:21:06.250 --> 01:21:08.590
varies as a function
of position.

01:21:08.590 --> 01:21:12.120
So here, this cloud is meant
to indicate a variable index.

01:21:12.120 --> 01:21:15.120
So you have high index, low
index, in different positions.

01:21:15.120 --> 01:21:18.330
So this is like a
generalized GRIN if you wish.

01:21:18.330 --> 01:21:19.370
We saw two types.

01:21:19.370 --> 01:21:23.070
You saw quadratic
and you saw axial.

01:21:23.070 --> 01:21:24.270
But it could be really--

01:21:24.270 --> 01:21:26.490
in principle, I should be
able to fabricate something

01:21:26.490 --> 01:21:26.990
like this.

01:21:26.990 --> 01:21:30.540
Not that it is readily
doable, but let's

01:21:30.540 --> 01:21:33.710
consider it for
the sake of value.

01:21:33.710 --> 01:21:35.340
So you've seen this
diagram before.

01:21:35.340 --> 01:21:37.560
In fact, I copied this
from an earlier slide.

01:21:37.560 --> 01:21:39.500
One of the previous--

01:21:39.500 --> 01:21:42.980
I think it was in the first
lecture or second lecture.

01:21:42.980 --> 01:21:46.490
So we don't know
really what path

01:21:46.490 --> 01:21:49.970
a ray will follow through
these variable index medium,

01:21:49.970 --> 01:21:51.050
but we know one thing.

01:21:51.050 --> 01:21:55.160
We know that if you integrate
this quantity, if you integrate

01:21:55.160 --> 01:22:00.530
the index of refraction
times the length,

01:22:00.530 --> 01:22:03.680
the elemental length
along the path of the ray,

01:22:03.680 --> 01:22:07.710
we know that Fermat requires
that these quantities will

01:22:07.710 --> 01:22:08.790
be minimized.

01:22:14.440 --> 01:22:17.940
So how do we deal with that?

01:22:17.940 --> 01:22:20.240
I mean, what can
we do about this?

01:22:20.240 --> 01:22:26.080
Now, some of you who have taken
advanced mechanics classes,

01:22:26.080 --> 01:22:29.010
this sounds a
little bit familiar.

01:22:29.010 --> 01:22:32.130
What is the name that
comes to mind when you

01:22:32.130 --> 01:22:33.790
see this kind of expression?

01:22:33.790 --> 01:22:35.310
So let me repeat again.

01:22:35.310 --> 01:22:37.740
I have a situation
where something--

01:22:37.740 --> 01:22:39.360
in this case, a
light ray, but it

01:22:39.360 --> 01:22:41.730
could be something
else, a particle

01:22:41.730 --> 01:22:45.243
or some mechanical analogy--

01:22:45.243 --> 01:22:47.160
can follow a number of
different trajectories.

01:22:47.160 --> 01:22:53.540
It can go this way or it can go
this way or this way and so on.

01:22:53.540 --> 01:22:55.840
To give you another
sort of trivial example,

01:22:55.840 --> 01:23:00.040
if I drop my marker here,
it goes down straight.

01:23:00.040 --> 01:23:03.540
So you may have wondered, well,
why does it go down straight?

01:23:03.540 --> 01:23:05.320
Why does it not do
something like this

01:23:05.320 --> 01:23:07.080
or like this or whatever?

01:23:07.080 --> 01:23:09.630
Why does it not go
up, for that matter?

01:23:09.630 --> 01:23:11.550
Well, it goes straight because--

01:23:11.550 --> 01:23:15.110
well, because gravity
pulls it down right.

01:23:15.110 --> 01:23:17.280
Well, we're very
happy with that.

01:23:17.280 --> 01:23:21.300
We know from experience
that things fall straight.

01:23:21.300 --> 01:23:23.310
But we also know that
gravity does not always

01:23:23.310 --> 01:23:25.260
produce straight trajectories.

01:23:25.260 --> 01:23:27.930
For example, the Earth.

01:23:27.930 --> 01:23:31.320
Thankfully, the Earth
follows a circular,

01:23:31.320 --> 01:23:34.657
or actually elliptical,
trajectory around the sun.

01:23:34.657 --> 01:23:36.990
And that's very fortunate
because if the Earth had a way

01:23:36.990 --> 01:23:38.970
to escape from the sun,
then we would all be--

01:23:38.970 --> 01:23:41.940
we would not even exist.

01:23:41.940 --> 01:23:47.510
So we know that gravity can
produce straight trajectories.

01:23:47.510 --> 01:23:52.520
It can produce
elliptical trajectories,

01:23:52.520 --> 01:23:56.530
hyperbolical trajectories,
and so on and so forth.

01:23:56.530 --> 01:24:00.250
So there's more to it
than the straight falling

01:24:00.250 --> 01:24:08.022
of the apple in Newton's case
or of the marker in my case.

01:24:08.022 --> 01:24:10.230
So anyway, so the reason
I'm giving all this preamble

01:24:10.230 --> 01:24:13.740
is because this may
be familiar for you

01:24:13.740 --> 01:24:16.470
from the field of mechanics.

01:24:16.470 --> 01:24:18.960
And the buzzword
that comes to mind

01:24:18.960 --> 01:24:22.590
when you have this kind of
integral with something inside

01:24:22.590 --> 01:24:26.620
and you demand that the
integral itself is maximized

01:24:26.620 --> 01:24:28.440
is Lagrangian.

01:24:28.440 --> 01:24:32.910
It is the Lagrangian principle
that you may have seen.

01:24:32.910 --> 01:24:37.655
I don't think those of
you took 2003 saw it.

01:24:37.655 --> 01:24:39.030
Did you or did
you not, actually?

01:24:39.030 --> 01:24:41.390
I don't know.

01:24:41.390 --> 01:24:43.225
Is anybody in the
class who took 2003?

01:24:43.225 --> 01:24:46.000
You should because
2004 is a prerequisite.

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:47.500
And as a principle,
if you are here,

01:24:47.500 --> 01:24:57.120
it means you have taken
both 2003 and 2004.

01:24:57.120 --> 01:25:02.523
We have lost our undergraduates,
or they lost their voice,

01:25:02.523 --> 01:25:03.440
or they're too sleepy.

01:25:03.440 --> 01:25:05.615
Anyway.

01:25:05.615 --> 01:25:07.240
Or there's another
possibility, that we

01:25:07.240 --> 01:25:13.550
don't remember if we were
taught Lagrangians in 2003.

01:25:13.550 --> 01:25:15.610
Anyway.

01:25:15.610 --> 01:25:16.860
But I will not do it this way.

01:25:16.860 --> 01:25:20.760
So it turns out I can solve
this problem using a Lagrangian

01:25:20.760 --> 01:25:21.820
formulation.

01:25:21.820 --> 01:25:23.070
But I will not do it this way.

01:25:23.070 --> 01:25:25.420
Did someone want to speak?

01:25:25.420 --> 01:25:26.420
I saw the camera moving.

01:25:26.420 --> 01:25:29.785
Was someone about to speak?

01:25:29.785 --> 01:25:31.410
AUDIENCE: I was just
going to say, yes,

01:25:31.410 --> 01:25:32.680
we did have Lagrangian.

01:25:32.680 --> 01:25:34.060
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
Ah, you did.

01:25:34.060 --> 01:25:34.560
OK.

01:25:34.560 --> 01:25:36.221
Thank you.

01:25:36.221 --> 01:25:37.155
Thank you.

01:25:42.120 --> 01:25:44.440
Well, even if you did,
I guess I will not

01:25:44.440 --> 01:25:47.230
do it with the Lagrangians
because, well, the math is

01:25:47.230 --> 01:25:54.080
too complicated and would
kind of cause a detour here.

01:25:54.080 --> 01:25:56.250
Nevertheless, I will use
a mechanical analogy.

01:25:56.250 --> 01:25:58.850
So for a moment, we'll
take a break from optics.

01:25:58.850 --> 01:26:02.660
And I guess to
justify why 2004 is

01:26:02.660 --> 01:26:06.800
a prerequisite for this
class, I will show this.

01:26:06.800 --> 01:26:09.350
And I will spend, I guess,
the next 15 or so minutes

01:26:09.350 --> 01:26:12.410
to establish a connection
between this mechanical system

01:26:12.410 --> 01:26:14.940
and light rays.

01:26:14.940 --> 01:26:16.905
For now, let's forget
about light rays.

01:26:16.905 --> 01:26:19.860
I've given you-- it's
actually a particle.

01:26:19.860 --> 01:26:22.570
So it looks like a car
but it's really small.

01:26:22.570 --> 01:26:25.590
So I don't have to worry
about moments of inertia

01:26:25.590 --> 01:26:28.480
and all of that stuff.

01:26:28.480 --> 01:26:31.720
It is also frictionless, so
I don't have any dissipation

01:26:31.720 --> 01:26:33.440
at all in the system.

01:26:33.440 --> 01:26:36.400
This particle is
attached to a rigid--

01:26:36.400 --> 01:26:43.660
to an immobile, rigid
wall with a spring.

01:26:43.660 --> 01:26:45.520
And basically what
I can do is I can

01:26:45.520 --> 01:26:49.870
inject some energy into the
particles by pulling it.

01:26:49.870 --> 01:26:53.620
So if I do that, then
we know that this system

01:26:53.620 --> 01:26:56.860
has two forms of energy.

01:26:56.860 --> 01:26:59.530
When I actually pull
it, what I do is I

01:26:59.530 --> 01:27:02.410
store energy in the spring.

01:27:02.410 --> 01:27:05.530
The spring is not happy
having its energy stored.

01:27:05.530 --> 01:27:07.450
It will want to give it away.

01:27:07.450 --> 01:27:09.900
What does it mean to
give away the energy?

01:27:09.900 --> 01:27:11.470
It means to convert
it to kinetic.

01:27:11.470 --> 01:27:15.250
It means the spring will start
pulling the particle back.

01:27:15.250 --> 01:27:18.340
As the particle is pulled
back, it will accelerate.

01:27:18.340 --> 01:27:20.480
It will reach a
maximum velocity--

01:27:20.480 --> 01:27:23.320
we know that from
classical mechanics--

01:27:23.320 --> 01:27:28.210
approximately where the
spring has zero displacement.

01:27:28.210 --> 01:27:29.770
And at this point,
all of the energy

01:27:29.770 --> 01:27:32.170
has been converted to kinetic.

01:27:32.170 --> 01:27:34.868
And of course it will not stop
there because it is moving,

01:27:34.868 --> 01:27:36.160
and there's nothing to stop it.

01:27:36.160 --> 01:27:37.630
It will keep moving.

01:27:37.630 --> 01:27:39.190
But if it moves,
now it is beginning

01:27:39.190 --> 01:27:41.740
to push, to squeeze this spring.

01:27:41.740 --> 01:27:44.830
So now the particle is
giving back its energy

01:27:44.830 --> 01:27:48.900
into the spring until all of
the energy has been given.

01:27:48.900 --> 01:27:50.760
Now the spring is squeezed.

01:27:50.760 --> 01:27:52.020
Doesn't like to be squeezed.

01:27:52.020 --> 01:27:56.100
It starts giving energy
back to the particle.

01:27:56.100 --> 01:27:57.810
And of course, on
and on they go.

01:27:57.810 --> 01:28:00.810
This will execute and
oscillate in motion

01:28:00.810 --> 01:28:07.210
forever because I
neglected all dissipation.

01:28:07.210 --> 01:28:09.490
And of course, what is
happening in this case is

01:28:09.490 --> 01:28:13.860
that at any given moment, the
particle will have a mix--

01:28:13.860 --> 01:28:18.640
the system will have a mix
of kinetic energy and energy

01:28:18.640 --> 01:28:21.550
stored into the spring,
which is referred

01:28:21.550 --> 01:28:23.960
to as potential energy.

01:28:23.960 --> 01:28:27.270
So of course, the kinetic
energy is given by 1/2 times

01:28:27.270 --> 01:28:29.520
the mass times the
velocity squared.

01:28:29.520 --> 01:28:31.920
If you remember the
definition of momentum,

01:28:31.920 --> 01:28:35.050
momentum equals
mass times velocity.

01:28:35.050 --> 01:28:36.960
So I can also
write it like this.

01:28:36.960 --> 01:28:40.470
Momentum squared over
2 times the mass.

01:28:40.470 --> 01:28:41.910
And the potential energy--

01:28:41.910 --> 01:28:45.240
actually, the potential energy
can have very different forms

01:28:45.240 --> 01:28:49.500
depending on what is exactly
the energy storage element.

01:28:49.500 --> 01:28:50.960
In the case of a spring--

01:28:50.960 --> 01:28:54.230
actually, in the case of a
hook spring, a linear spring,

01:28:54.230 --> 01:28:58.110
it is simply equal to the
square of the displacement

01:28:58.110 --> 01:29:03.400
of the spring with respect
to its rest position.

01:29:03.400 --> 01:29:05.800
So anyway, no matter
what these things are,

01:29:05.800 --> 01:29:08.620
the sum must be
constant because, again,

01:29:08.620 --> 01:29:11.380
energy cannot be gained
or lost by its system.

01:29:11.380 --> 01:29:13.960
So the sum of the potential
and kinetic energy

01:29:13.960 --> 01:29:17.340
is always conserved.

01:29:17.340 --> 01:29:19.530
So that is one thing,
and it's very good.

01:29:22.250 --> 01:29:26.900
Now, let me play a game.

01:29:30.190 --> 01:29:38.595
So first of all, I
will write the energy.

01:29:38.595 --> 01:29:40.470
I will basically repeat
what is on the slide.

01:29:40.470 --> 01:29:44.100
I will repeat it on
the whiteboard here.

01:29:44.100 --> 01:29:45.658
So let me write the energy.

01:29:45.658 --> 01:29:46.950
I will write it in a funny way.

01:29:46.950 --> 01:29:52.430
I will write it as a function of
the momentum p and the position

01:29:52.430 --> 01:29:53.160
q.

01:29:53.160 --> 01:29:55.460
And now, in the
previous slide, these

01:29:55.460 --> 01:30:00.920
were actually scalar quantities
because this thing moves only

01:30:00.920 --> 01:30:03.180
along a straight line.

01:30:03.180 --> 01:30:07.130
But in general, of course, I
can have positions and momenta

01:30:07.130 --> 01:30:09.110
that are vectors.

01:30:09.110 --> 01:30:10.500
So I switched to
vector notation.

01:30:10.500 --> 01:30:13.880
I hope that doesn't
confuse you horribly.

01:30:13.880 --> 01:30:14.900
So let me write it down.

01:30:14.900 --> 01:30:20.510
So in the vector case, this
will equal the momentum vector

01:30:20.510 --> 01:30:27.020
divided by 2m plus 1/2 m--

01:30:27.020 --> 01:30:27.700
wait a minute.

01:30:27.700 --> 01:30:36.250
1/2 k, the spring constant,
times the position vector

01:30:36.250 --> 01:30:38.400
square.

01:30:38.400 --> 01:30:40.890
Now what I'm going
to do, for fun,

01:30:40.890 --> 01:30:45.000
is I'm going to take derivatives
of this quantity with respect

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:48.270
to the position
and the momentum.

01:30:48.270 --> 01:30:50.340
Of course, since
these became vectors,

01:30:50.340 --> 01:30:52.080
now these are not
exactly derivatives,

01:30:52.080 --> 01:30:54.000
they are gradients.

01:30:54.000 --> 01:31:00.570
So basically what I will do is
I will compute the gradient of H

01:31:00.570 --> 01:31:01.830
with respect to p.

01:31:08.010 --> 01:31:09.240
This is a matter of notation.

01:31:09.240 --> 01:31:15.090
I will denote it as dH dp.

01:31:15.090 --> 01:31:16.440
So what is dH dp?

01:31:16.440 --> 01:31:24.600
Well, what I have to do
is I have to compute--

01:31:24.600 --> 01:31:28.620
clearly this term does not play
because it only depends on q.

01:31:28.620 --> 01:31:31.540
But this term
contains the momentum.

01:31:31.540 --> 01:31:33.970
So if I do it, it will
actually-- you can do it.

01:31:33.970 --> 01:31:38.770
It is actually p times its--

01:31:43.020 --> 01:31:44.900
p over m.

01:31:44.900 --> 01:31:45.400
That's it.

01:31:45.400 --> 01:31:45.942
Nothing else.

01:31:48.370 --> 01:31:54.038
And then I'm going to do
the same with respect to q.

01:31:56.970 --> 01:32:01.220
And I'm going to call it dH dq.

01:32:01.220 --> 01:32:04.130
Again, it is a gradient
with respect to q.

01:32:04.130 --> 01:32:06.050
And for the same reasons
as the other one,

01:32:06.050 --> 01:32:08.350
it will turn out
to be k times 2.

01:32:11.720 --> 01:32:12.220
OK.

01:32:12.220 --> 01:32:14.630
Then again for fun--

01:32:14.630 --> 01:32:16.980
I'm not justifying
what I'm doing.

01:32:16.980 --> 01:32:20.440
It's just coming sort of some--

01:32:20.440 --> 01:32:24.220
coming out of some
sort of epiphany.

01:32:24.220 --> 01:32:28.210
I will write down two
differential equations.

01:32:28.210 --> 01:32:30.540
One of them, I will
write this one.

01:32:30.540 --> 01:32:32.940
It is already on
your screen there.

01:32:32.940 --> 01:32:36.870
dq dt.

01:32:36.870 --> 01:32:37.830
What is that?

01:32:37.830 --> 01:32:40.730
That's the time derivative
of the displacement.

01:32:40.730 --> 01:32:43.140
Therefore, it is the velocity.

01:32:43.140 --> 01:32:51.870
So we'll take it to be equal
to the gradient of the quantity

01:32:51.870 --> 01:32:58.010
H of the energy, that we called
it H for some strange reason,

01:32:58.010 --> 01:33:00.020
with respect to the
opposite variable.

01:33:00.020 --> 01:33:01.655
This was the derivative of q.

01:33:01.655 --> 01:33:04.280
I will take its gradient
with respect to p.

01:33:07.620 --> 01:33:08.870
And let's see what I get.

01:33:08.870 --> 01:33:14.920
This way I get p over m.

01:33:14.920 --> 01:33:18.300
That's correct.

01:33:18.300 --> 01:33:22.540
Actually, this equation is
not particularly insightful.

01:33:22.540 --> 01:33:25.770
This is the definition
of momentum, isn't it?

01:33:25.770 --> 01:33:32.910
If you recall-- this means
recall, like in cartoons.

01:33:32.910 --> 01:33:36.200
The little cloud.

01:33:36.200 --> 01:33:43.410
The momentum is defined
as m times dq dt.

01:33:43.410 --> 01:33:45.750
That's the definition
of momentum.

01:33:45.750 --> 01:33:48.050
So by doing this
trick, by taking

01:33:48.050 --> 01:33:53.660
the gradient of the energy
with respect to the momentum

01:33:53.660 --> 01:34:00.920
and setting it equal to the
velocity, I got a true result.

01:34:00.920 --> 01:34:03.420
I got a result that
happens to be true.

01:34:03.420 --> 01:34:06.860
Now let's see if I can
pull the opposite trick.

01:34:06.860 --> 01:34:10.070
If I can take the
derivative with respect

01:34:10.070 --> 01:34:14.970
to time of the momentum, that's
like an acceleration quantity

01:34:14.970 --> 01:34:17.790
because momentum is velocity.

01:34:17.790 --> 01:34:20.170
So its derivative
is acceleration.

01:34:20.170 --> 01:34:22.610
And let's see if I can
get away by putting

01:34:22.610 --> 01:34:27.550
it equal to the derivative
of this quantity H

01:34:27.550 --> 01:34:29.770
with respect to
the other variable.

01:34:29.770 --> 01:34:32.170
In this case, I cannot
quite get away with it.

01:34:32.170 --> 01:34:35.620
I have to put a minus sign.

01:34:35.620 --> 01:34:37.460
And what do I get if
I put a minus sign?

01:34:37.460 --> 01:34:37.960
kq.

01:34:41.853 --> 01:34:42.520
What's this now?

01:34:48.510 --> 01:34:50.730
kq?

01:34:50.730 --> 01:34:54.020
It is k times displacement.

01:34:54.020 --> 01:34:59.020
So what are the units of Hooke's
constant time displacement?

01:34:59.020 --> 01:35:00.970
Force.

01:35:00.970 --> 01:35:02.220
What is on the left-hand side?

01:35:06.280 --> 01:35:06.780
OK.

01:35:06.780 --> 01:35:07.800
I said acceleration.

01:35:07.800 --> 01:35:09.840
Actually, I should
have corrected myself,

01:35:09.840 --> 01:35:13.120
and I should have said,
proportional to acceleration.

01:35:13.120 --> 01:35:15.220
This is the derivative
of the momentum.

01:35:15.220 --> 01:35:17.900
So therefore, it is force.

01:35:17.900 --> 01:35:19.980
So what is this then,
the equation that I got?

01:35:23.820 --> 01:35:26.960
It is the force balance on the--

01:35:26.960 --> 01:35:30.000
it is Newton's law,
actually, on the particle.

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:34.170
It says that the force
pulling the particle,

01:35:34.170 --> 01:35:38.300
it is the restoring
force due to the spring.

01:35:38.300 --> 01:35:41.630
And what are the two
equations combined?

01:35:41.630 --> 01:35:43.650
Actually, the two
equations combined,

01:35:43.650 --> 01:35:47.020
they are what we call
the equations of motion.

01:35:47.020 --> 01:35:49.440
The equations of
motion, by definition,

01:35:49.440 --> 01:35:52.650
are first order
differential equations

01:35:52.650 --> 01:35:55.620
that link the dynamical
variables that

01:35:55.620 --> 01:36:00.250
is the position, the
displacement, and the velocity.

01:36:00.250 --> 01:36:01.270
So this is what I did.

01:36:01.270 --> 01:36:03.960
I got a set of
differential equations

01:36:03.960 --> 01:36:08.430
that link the displacement
to the momentum-- that

01:36:08.430 --> 01:36:09.540
is the velocity.

01:36:09.540 --> 01:36:14.370
And again, the derivative of
the displacement back to the--

01:36:14.370 --> 01:36:16.120
I'm sorry, the derivative
of the velocity,

01:36:16.120 --> 01:36:19.200
the derivative of the momentum,
back to the displacement

01:36:19.200 --> 01:36:21.120
itself.

01:36:21.120 --> 01:36:28.460
So if you look at it, if
you omit this middle part,

01:36:28.460 --> 01:36:31.210
if you look at it like
this, these are simply--

01:36:31.210 --> 01:36:34.600
as I said, these are
the equations of motion.

01:36:34.600 --> 01:36:39.630
If you look at this part
over here, this is of course

01:36:39.630 --> 01:36:42.950
a more general result. That's
why I bothered to do it.

01:36:42.950 --> 01:36:44.700
And this is where the
connection to optics

01:36:44.700 --> 01:36:46.980
will come from next week.

01:36:46.980 --> 01:36:50.550
This set of equations
is called Hamiltonian.

01:36:54.940 --> 01:36:58.190
And I will put in
brackets "canonical."

01:36:58.190 --> 01:36:59.790
I don't particularly
like this term.

01:36:59.790 --> 01:37:01.970
But anyway, some people use it.

01:37:01.970 --> 01:37:05.539
Hamiltonian canonical equations.

01:37:10.030 --> 01:37:12.410
So the point, then, which
I will say just this,

01:37:12.410 --> 01:37:14.760
and then I will stop
and continue next time,

01:37:14.760 --> 01:37:18.200
the point is that this is now
a much more general property.

01:37:18.200 --> 01:37:22.400
Even though I showed that it
is true for the specific case

01:37:22.400 --> 01:37:26.450
of a mass spring
system without damper--

01:37:26.450 --> 01:37:27.800
I showed that to be true.

01:37:27.800 --> 01:37:30.260
But this is a more
general property

01:37:30.260 --> 01:37:36.630
for any dynamical system that
has a conserved quantity.

01:37:36.630 --> 01:37:38.460
So in the case of the
mechanical system,

01:37:38.460 --> 01:37:40.900
the conserved
quantity is energy.

01:37:40.900 --> 01:37:42.670
If this conserved
quantity can be

01:37:42.670 --> 01:37:46.540
written as a function of
the dynamical variables,

01:37:46.540 --> 01:37:52.010
in this case, of the mechanical
system position and momentum--

01:37:52.010 --> 01:37:52.510
OK.

01:37:52.510 --> 01:37:54.880
So I started a long sentence.

01:37:54.880 --> 01:37:57.460
Let me close my sentence.

01:37:57.460 --> 01:38:02.170
So if a dynamical system
has a conserved quantity,

01:38:02.170 --> 01:38:07.880
then I can write down a set
of Hamiltonian equations

01:38:07.880 --> 01:38:09.770
for this dynamical
system in terms

01:38:09.770 --> 01:38:13.280
of the gradients of
this conserved quantity.

01:38:13.280 --> 01:38:16.490
And that will be the
equations of motion.

01:38:16.490 --> 01:38:17.520
OK.

01:38:17.520 --> 01:38:20.270
So what we will
do then next time

01:38:20.270 --> 01:38:23.120
is we will actually
show, in almost one

01:38:23.120 --> 01:38:25.340
to one analogy, that--

01:38:25.340 --> 01:38:27.470
oh, and by the way,
this conserved quantity

01:38:27.470 --> 01:38:30.890
that we called it energy in the
case of the mechanical system,

01:38:30.890 --> 01:38:33.410
in general it's called
the Hamiltonian.

01:38:33.410 --> 01:38:38.540
So H itself is the Hamiltonian.

01:38:38.540 --> 01:38:40.460
So what we'll do next
is we will actually

01:38:40.460 --> 01:38:47.060
show we can derive a Hamiltonian
for rays for an optical system.

01:38:47.060 --> 01:38:50.600
And of course, when we write
equations of motion for rays,

01:38:50.600 --> 01:38:53.550
we'll get the ray trajectories.

01:38:53.550 --> 01:38:55.483
Therefore, we will be
able to ray tracing.

01:38:55.483 --> 01:38:56.900
And the reason
this is interesting

01:38:56.900 --> 01:39:00.410
because the potential
actually will turn out

01:39:00.410 --> 01:39:02.670
to be the index of refraction.

01:39:02.670 --> 01:39:05.630
And in the same way,
the potential here,

01:39:05.630 --> 01:39:08.540
if you go back to my equation--

01:39:08.540 --> 01:39:12.930
the potential turned out to
be a function of position.

01:39:12.930 --> 01:39:16.860
In the gradient index optics
that we mentioned just now,

01:39:16.860 --> 01:39:19.820
the index of refraction
is a function of position.

01:39:19.820 --> 01:39:23.820
So we will see that in the
case of the GRIN element,

01:39:23.820 --> 01:39:27.000
the index of refraction actually
has the role of a potential.

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.050
And it is this potential
that draws the--

01:39:29.050 --> 01:39:30.750
very similar to gravity.

01:39:30.750 --> 01:39:32.850
The potential that
draws the sun--

01:39:32.850 --> 01:39:36.630
I mean, that draws the Earth to
rotate around the sun and not

01:39:36.630 --> 01:39:38.350
the other way around.

01:39:38.350 --> 01:39:40.560
The same way the
potential draws the Earth

01:39:40.560 --> 01:39:43.710
to rotate around the
sun, it is a similar,

01:39:43.710 --> 01:39:46.170
or I should say analogous,
kind of potential

01:39:46.170 --> 01:39:49.980
that draws rays inwards
in a GRIN element

01:39:49.980 --> 01:39:53.610
and causes them to focus.

01:39:53.610 --> 01:39:57.820
So we'll pick up
on that next time.

01:39:57.820 --> 01:40:00.970
And obviously, don't worry
about this for the quiz.

01:40:00.970 --> 01:40:03.570
So I'm not crazy.

01:40:03.570 --> 01:40:05.040
So yeah.

01:40:05.040 --> 01:40:08.350
So we'll properly conclude
this topic next time.

01:40:08.350 --> 01:40:10.500
It will be next week's homework.

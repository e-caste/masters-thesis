00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.750
The goal of baseball team is to make the playoffs.

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:14.920
The A's approach was to get to the playoffs
by using analytics.

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.410
We'll first show how we can predict whether
or not

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:21.980
a team will make the playoffs by knowing how
many games they

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.570
won in the regular season.

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.570
We will then use linear regression
to predict how many games a team will

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.930
win using the difference between runs scored
and runs allowed,

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:34.720
or opponent runs.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:39.390
We will then use linear regression again
to predict the number of runs a team will

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.170
score
using batting statistics, and the number of

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.460
runs a team will allow using fielding and
pitching

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:47.460
statistics.

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.359
We'll start by figuring out how many games
a team needs

00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:56.690
to win to make the playoffs, and then
how many more runs a team needs to score than

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.589
their opponent
to win that many games.

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:03.780
So our first question is how many games does
a team

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.020
need to win in the regular season
to make it to the playoffs.

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.590
In Moneyball, Paul DePodesta reduced the regular
season

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:12.900
to a math problem.

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.450
He judged that it would take 95 wins for the
A's to make it

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.340
to the playoffs.

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.479
Let's see if we can verify this using data.

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:30.329
This graph uses data from all teams and seasons,
from 1996 to 2001.

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.329
There is a point on the graph for every team
and season pair.

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:38.670
They are sorted on the x-axis by number of
regular season wins,

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.720
and are ordered on the y-axis by team.

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.580
The gray points correspond to the teams that
did not

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.860
make the playoffs, and the red points
correspond to the teams that did make the

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.729
playoffs.

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.060
This graph shows us that if a team wins 95
or more games,

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.119
or is on the right side of this line,
they almost certainly will make it to the

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:00.119
playoffs.

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:06.539
But if a team wins, say, 85 or more games
then they're likely to make it to the playoffs,

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:08.600
but it's not as certain.

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.970
And if a team wins, say, 100 or more games
then

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.980
they definitely will make it to the playoffs.

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:20.200
So this graph shows us that if a team wins
95 or more games then

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.560
they have a strong chance of making it
to the playoffs, which confirms Paul DePodesta's

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.230
claim.

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.520
So we know that a team wants to win 95 or
more games.

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.470
But how does a team win games?

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.630
Well, they score more runs than their opponent
does.

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:40.340
But how many more do they need to score?

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:46.510
The A's calculated that they needed
to score 135 more runs than they allowed

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.650
during the regular season to expect to win
95 games.

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:57.420
Let's see if we can verify this using linear
regression in R.

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.170
In our R console, let's start by loading our
data.

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.630
We'll call it baseball, and use the read.csv
function

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:10.090
to read in the data file, baseball.csv.

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:17.120
We can look at the structure of our data
by using the str function.

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:24.290
This data set includes an observation
for every team and year pair from 1962 to

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:29.590
for all seasons with 162 games.

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:36.310
We have 15 variables in our data set,
including runs scored, RS, runs allowed,

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.370
RA, and Wins, W. We also have several other
variables

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.650
that we'll use when building models later
on in the lecture.

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:47.980
Since we are confirming the claims made in
Moneyball,

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:52.880
we want to build models using data
Paul DePodesta had in 2002.

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.540
So let's start by subsetting our data to only
include

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:59.400
the years before 2002.

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.010
We'll call our new data set, moneyball, and
use

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:07.270
the subset function to only take the rows
of baseball

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:11.430
for which year is less than 2002.

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:14.430
We can look at this structure of the data
set, moneyball,

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.720
by using the str function again.

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:23.030
Now, we have 902 observations of the same
15 variables.

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:28.650
So we want to build a linear regression equation
to predict wins using the difference between

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:31.270
runs
scored and runs allowed.

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:36.849
To make this a little easier, let's
start by creating a new variable called, RD,

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:45.139
for run difference,
and set that equal to runs scored minus runs

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:46.530
allowed.

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:52.280
If we look at the structure of our data again,
we can see that we have a new variable called,

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:53.680
RD.

00:04:53.680 --> 00:05:00.259
So let's build a linear regression equation
using the lm function to predict wins

00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:08.830
with RD as our independent variable,
and using the data set, moneyball.

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:13.560
We can look at the summary of our linear regression
equation,

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:18.860
and we can see that both the intercept
and our independent variable, RD, are highly

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:20.340
significant.

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:23.229
And our R-squared is 0.88.

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:28.600
So we have a strong model to predict wins
using the difference between runs scored and

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:29.870
runs allowed.

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:34.870
Now, let's see if we can use this model
to confirm the claim made in Moneyball that

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:39.020
a team needs
to score at least 135 more runs than they

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:45.719
allow to win at least 95 games.

00:05:45.719 --> 00:05:56.909
Our regression equation is wins equals
80.8814, our intercept term, plus the coefficient

00:05:56.909 --> 00:06:02.840
for run
difference, 0.1058, times run difference,

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:04.699
or RD.

00:06:04.699 --> 00:06:08.860
We want wins to be greater than or equal to
95.

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:13.889
This will be true if and only if our regression
equation is also

00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:24.389
greater than or equal to 95.

00:06:24.389 --> 00:06:28.210
By manipulating this equation, we
can see that this will be true if

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:37.099
and only if run difference, or RD,
is greater than or equal to 95 minus the intercept

00:06:37.099 --> 00:06:47.689
term,
88.8814, divided by 0.1058, which is equal

00:06:47.689 --> 00:06:53.689
to 133.4.

00:06:53.689 --> 00:06:57.539
So this tells us that if the run difference
of a team

00:06:57.539 --> 00:07:03.919
is greater than or equal to 133.4
then they will win at least 95 games,

00:07:03.919 --> 00:07:06.719
according to our regression equation.

00:07:06.719 --> 00:07:12.930
This is very close to the claim made in Moneyball
that a team needs to score at least 135 more

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:17.029
runs than they
allow to win at least 95 games.

00:07:17.029 --> 00:07:21.949
So using linear regression and data,
we were able to verify the claim made

00:07:21.949 --> 00:07:23.699
by Paul DePodesta in Moneyball.

00:00:20.586 --> 00:00:22.352
PROFESSOR: Good
morning everybody.

00:00:22.352 --> 00:00:24.060
Today we're going to
continue our journey

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.610
in looking at the 10 sort
of basic types of reactions

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:33.210
that you will encounter when
studying basic metabolism.

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.470
And they're all found
on your vitamin bottle.

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:39.220
So here are the
Flintstones vitamins.

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.325
I like Flintstones
vitamins because you

00:00:41.325 --> 00:00:42.450
don't have to swallow them.

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:43.690
You can chew them.

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:46.490
And today what I'm going
to start talking about

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:48.200
is redox chemistry.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.350
What are the two redox
active cofactors?

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.710
And what we will
focus on today is

00:00:53.710 --> 00:01:02.110
vitamin B2, which is riboflavin,
and vitamin B3 which is niacin.

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:08.700
So we're going to talk about
oxidation and reduction.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.150
And what the cofactors
are that involved

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.470
in these transformations in
all primary metabolic pathways.

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.450
So the first thing I want
to do is introduce you

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.990
to these two cofactors, the
structure of the cofactors.

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.700
Then what I'll do is focus on a
comparison of their properties.

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.050
And then I want to
focus on the mechanism

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:32.350
of how these cofactors work.

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.470
And once you master
these concepts,

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.510
you really will encounter
them over and over again

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:40.680
throughout your
journey in metabolism.

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.810
And you'll be familiar
with the kinds

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.760
of chemical transformations
that are occurring.

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:53.320
So the first cofactor
comes from niacin.

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:58.310
And it is nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotide

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:59.380
in the reduced state.

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.480
Or nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotide

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.820
in the oxidized state.

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.940
And as with all
cofactors, the vitamins

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.130
are a precursor to
the cofactor, and they

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.130
have to be converted
inside the cell

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.870
to the active form
of the cofactor.

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.560
So if you look at NADH-- let
me draw that structure for you,

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.930
and then I'm going to show you
that while the structure is

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.250
quite complex, most of it is
not volved in the chemical

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:29.240
transformations.

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:34.410
And so we'll put a big R
group on most of the cofactor.

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.620
And you don't have to
memorize the structures of any

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.500
of these cofactors.

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.580
And that you will be given
the structures whenever

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.080
you have any kind of
exercise to carry out.

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:57.060
So the form of the vitamin is
actually a nicotinamide ring.

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.080
And then it needs
to be metabolized

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.070
to the structure I'm
drawing now which

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:04.400
has the nicotinamide
ring attached

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:13.040
to a ribose ring, which is then
attached to ADP, which you're

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.390
all familiar with.

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:17.160
And I'm just going to
abbreviate the adenosine part

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.600
of a molecule with an AD.

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.590
So this part of
the molecule we're

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:28.280
going to call for the rest
of this exercise today

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.550
the R group, because it's not
involved in the chemistry.

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:33.820
And really, all of
the chemistry happens

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:35.530
in this part of the molecule.

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:41.330
This is the business end,
and this is the reduced form

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:45.130
of the cofactor, NADH.

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:47.580
So in addition to
the reduced form,

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.440
since we're doing
oxidation and reduction,

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.580
you need to know what
the oxidized form is.

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:56.410
And the oxidized
form is the following

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:59.980
where you need to lose
a couple of electrons

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:03.480
and a couple of protons
out of this ring

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.330
to generate this
nicotinamide ring.

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:13.200
And again, this part of the
molecule is indicated as R,

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.149
and then you retain
a positive charge.

00:04:16.149 --> 00:04:18.040
So again, this is the
part of the molecule

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:19.690
we're going to be focusing on.

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:25.110
And this is the oxidized
form of the cofactor.

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.200
So what I want to
do now is show you

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:32.000
how this compares to the second
form of the organic cofactor

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.020
that you encounter over and
over again in metabolism.

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:41.535
And this is FADH2, or FMNH2.

00:04:41.535 --> 00:04:53.273
And that's the reduced
form, versus FAD or FMN.

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:58.570
So this is one of
the most complicated

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:00.280
of all the cofactors.

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:04.470
And you'll see that it
has a very complex ring

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:09.030
structure called an
isoalloxazine ring-- which

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:12.010
I'm drawing now--
that most of you

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:17.100
have likely never
encountered before.

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:21.360
And when you look at the
structure of this molecule,

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.950
you probably will have
no idea about where

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:25.330
the chemical reactivity is.

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:27.860
And I'll show you where
the chemical reactivity is

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:30.995
and how we know that
in a few minutes.

00:05:34.166 --> 00:05:44.460
So attached to this
nitrogen is more complex

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:57.380
structure with a sugar
where x can be phosphate.

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:01.870
This is called the
flavinmanonucleotide, reduced.

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:03.350
This is the reduced form.

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:11.090
And if x is equal to ADP, this
is flavinadninedineucleotide

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:11.670
reduce.

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:18.460
And I want to point out that
ADP is present in both NADH

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:24.380
and FADH2, as it is present
actually, in coenzyme A

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:27.130
and in ATP.

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:30.740
So ADP plays a central role
in almost all the chemical

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:33.390
transformations,
the 10 reactions

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:36.450
we actually talk about
that are central to all

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:38.180
of primary metabolism.

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:41.990
However in this case, again,
this part of the molecule

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:45.530
we're going to call R, is not
involved in the chemistry.

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:51.170
So the business end of the
molecule is indicated here.

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:56.100
And so this is the business end,
in this is the reduced state.

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:02.240
So this cofactor has
to be able to toggle

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:05.490
between the reduced state
and the oxidized state.

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:10.477
And if you look at
the oxidized state--

00:07:10.477 --> 00:07:12.810
so I'm going to indicate this
whole part of the molecule

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:21.550
is R-- you could see
a change in this part

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:23.800
of the isoalloxazine ring.

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:28.740
That is you've lost two
protons and two electrons

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:32.850
to form the oxidized
form of this cofactor.

00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:35.870
Now I also want to give
you the nomenclature

00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:37.986
for the isoalloxazine
ring because I'm

00:07:37.986 --> 00:07:39.860
going to tell you where
the chemical reactive

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:40.660
positions are.

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:43.240
And so you need to know
the numbering of the ring.

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:49.060
And so this is the N1
position, this is 2, 3, 4.

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:54.470
This carbon between these two
positions is called the C4A.

00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:57.130
This is carbon C4.

00:07:57.130 --> 00:08:00.350
And this is the N5 position.

00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:04.270
And we'll see that C4
and N5 become important

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:08.450
in the overall chemistry
of the transformation.

00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:10.560
So these are the two cofactors.

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:14.260
Again, this one is considerably
more complex than this one.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.070
But what I want
to do, and you'll

00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:19.550
see both of these cofactors used
over and over again in break

00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:20.960
down or biosynthesis.

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:26.120
The sugars breakdown or
biosynthesis of fatty acids.

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:28.330
The question is
when are they used

00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:32.289
and what is the distinction
between these cofactors?

00:08:32.289 --> 00:08:37.820
So what I want to do is compare
the properties of these two

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:41.780
cofactors and then
specifically give you

00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:45.560
an example of how each
of these cofactors work.

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:51.160
So on one side
I'll have NAD/NADH,

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:55.210
and the other side will have
FAD, again, the oxidized form,

00:08:55.210 --> 00:08:58.650
and FADH2, the reduced form.

00:08:58.650 --> 00:09:02.900
So we have NAD/NADH FAD/FADH2.

00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:05.460
And I want to compare
these two cofactors.

00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:10.520
And the first thing I want
to compare is the chemistry.

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:14.030
And what we will see
is NAD/NADH always

00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:18.820
does 2 electron chemistry
all of the time.

00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:26.550
On the other hand, FAD/FADH2 can
do either 1 electron chemistry

00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:29.420
or 2 electron chemistry.

00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:34.240
And in fact, function of
flavins inside the cell

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:37.520
is the major mediator
between something

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:41.440
that can donate 2 electrons
and can something that can

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:43.720
accept only a single electron.

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:46.040
So something they could
donate 2 electrons

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:49.190
would be NAD/NADH, which
I'll show you in a minute,

00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:52.600
and something that can accept
only a single electron,

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:53.980
or like metals.

00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:55.640
Like, if you think
back to hemoglobin,

00:09:55.640 --> 00:10:01.910
and you think about the ion 3
state going to the ion 2 state.

00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:04.422
So there's a big
distinction between the two.

00:10:04.422 --> 00:10:09.040
The second thing is since were
doing oxidation and reduction,

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:13.400
we need to think about
the reduction potentials.

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:15.350
And if you think
about the reduction

00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:22.100
potential of NAD NADH, it turns
out to be minus 320 millivolts.

00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:25.400
And what you need to recall
from freshman chemistry

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:29.350
is that the more
positive the number,

00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:31.630
the easier it is to reduce.

00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:34.790
So the fact that this
is minus 320 millivolts

00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:39.000
tells you that NAD likes to be
in the oxidized state, the NAD

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.410
state.

00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:45.220
On the other hand,
FAD/FADH2 can vary

00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:52.920
between minus 450 millivolts
to plus 150 millivolts.

00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:55.330
So this is a huge difference
in reduction potential,

00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:57.270
600 millivolts.

00:10:57.270 --> 00:10:59.060
So why is that true?

00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:02.600
It turns out that if
you look at the hundreds

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:05.640
of enzyme structures
that we now have-- we've

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:08.480
gone through a structural
revolution in the last 15

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:15.370
years-- all of the structures
where NAD/NADH bind are

00:11:15.370 --> 00:11:17.270
homologous to each other.

00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:19.390
And in fact, these
structures don't

00:11:19.390 --> 00:11:22.470
have anything designed into
the structure where they

00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:24.360
perturb the redox potential.

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:26.940
The redox potential
remains the same,

00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:31.090
regardless of what enzyme
time it's bound to.

00:11:31.090 --> 00:11:34.320
On the other hand,
flavins don't maintain

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:35.930
a single type of binding site.

00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:38.970
They have five or six different
kinds of binding sites.

00:11:38.970 --> 00:11:41.290
And that's because
the flavin chemistry,

00:11:41.290 --> 00:11:44.930
as you can see from this
isoalloxazine ring I introduced

00:11:44.930 --> 00:11:50.340
to you just a minute ago, does
much more diverse chemistry.

00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:58.320
And in fact, the active site
can tune the redox potential

00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:00.470
so it facilitates
either 2 electron

00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:02.790
chemistry or 1
electron chemistry

00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:06.440
or a combination of the two.

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:09.360
So the next thing that's
really important in thinking

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:12.220
about the two cofactors
and their differences

00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:18.710
is that NAD/NADH can
act as a substrate.

00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:23.130
That is, NAD/NADH is
any D, for example

00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:26.180
would act as an oxidant
of some second substrate.

00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:27.660
Every time you have
an oxidant, you

00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:31.190
have to have something
that's going to be oxidized.

00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:35.130
And during turn over of
oxidized reduced states,

00:12:35.130 --> 00:12:39.240
the substrates and products
must come on and off the enzyme.

00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:42.900
So they dissociate in
every single turn over.

00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:47.860
FAD/FADH2 on the
other hand, is always

00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:57.350
tightly bound or covalently
bound to the substrate.

00:12:57.350 --> 00:13:02.860
And so that means that if
FAD gets reduced to FADH2,

00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:04.340
it doesn't disassociate.

00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:08.170
So you need to have a way in
the active site of the enzyme

00:13:08.170 --> 00:13:12.042
where the FADH2
can be reoxidized.

00:13:12.042 --> 00:13:14.390
And again, that's quite
distinct from NAD/NADH.

00:13:17.514 --> 00:13:19.680
The fourth thing I want to
talk about just briefly--

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:21.138
and this is what
I'm going to focus

00:13:21.138 --> 00:13:22.760
the rest of this
little section on--

00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:27.730
is the mechanisms by which
these cofactors work.

00:13:27.730 --> 00:13:30.470
And so out of all
of the cofactors

00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:33.500
you're going to be introduced
to in this little this section

00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:36.870
in general on the
10 basic reactions,

00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:38.680
this is probably the simplest.

00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:45.250
And NAD/NADH involves hydride
transfer and proton transfer.

00:13:45.250 --> 00:13:48.920
So hydride is a hydrogen with a
pair of electrons and a proton.

00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:51.640
And we'll see that in a minute.

00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:58.570
With FAD/FADH2 the chemistry is
considerably more complicated.

00:13:58.570 --> 00:14:02.070
But what I will show
you is that it can also

00:14:02.070 --> 00:14:04.160
do hydride transfer.

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:06.360
And when it does
hydride transfer,

00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:09.760
it does it to the N5 position.

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:15.740
So if we go back for
a second and look

00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:18.270
at the flavin in
the nomenclature,

00:14:18.270 --> 00:14:20.270
this is the N5 position.

00:14:20.270 --> 00:14:23.350
I also pointed out you can
do C4A chemistry, which

00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:24.910
is in your lexicon,
but we're not

00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:27.990
going to discuss further today.

00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:31.140
So you can do N5 chemistry
by hydride transfer.

00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:34.500
And you can also
do C4A chemistry,

00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:37.450
which you will see
later on when you

00:14:37.450 --> 00:14:41.350
start talking about
primary metabolic pathways.

00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:45.750
So what I want to do now is
focus on a specific example

00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:48.350
and show you what the
basic chemistry is

00:14:48.350 --> 00:14:51.840
with these two systems
focusing on hydride transfer

00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:52.900
of chemistry.

00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:57.990
So an example I've
chosen to briefly look at

00:14:57.990 --> 00:15:03.090
is what I would call an ending
to the glycolysis pathway.

00:15:03.090 --> 00:15:05.020
Glycolosis, as you
already know, is

00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:09.640
breakdown of sugar under
anaerobic conditions.

00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:11.820
So under aerobic
conditions, what

00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:14.930
happens is when all
this energy is given off

00:15:14.930 --> 00:15:16.940
when you break down
your sugar, it's

00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:19.040
stored in chemical bonds, NADH.

00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:23.280
The NADH then goes into
the respiratory chain.

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:26.050
And the respiratory
chain ultimately

00:15:26.050 --> 00:15:29.330
transfers this energy
to convert oxygen

00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:32.330
into water, which
is really releases

00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:35.810
a huge amount of
energy, which is then

00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:40.920
trapped to make the energy
currency of the cell, ATP.

00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:43.180
So we're under
anaerobic conditions.

00:15:43.180 --> 00:15:46.530
And we need to be able
to recycle and keep.

00:15:46.530 --> 00:15:48.930
Because the NAD/NADH
comes off and on

00:15:48.930 --> 00:15:51.220
the enzyme at every
single turnover,

00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:57.110
you really need to be able to
recycle the reduced form back

00:15:57.110 --> 00:15:58.180
to the oxidized form.

00:15:58.180 --> 00:16:01.870
So glycolysis can
actually continue.

00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:05.880
So what happens at the
ending, one anaerobic ending

00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:11.190
of glycolysis, is you
need a proton plus NADH,

00:16:11.190 --> 00:16:12.950
so that's the
reduced form that's

00:16:12.950 --> 00:16:17.520
generated during glycolosis,
plus the molecule called

00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:18.260
pyruvate.

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:21.730
This is a molecule you're going
to see over and over again

00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:24.270
over the course of the
semester whose structure you

00:16:24.270 --> 00:16:25.320
need to remember.

00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:31.290
So this is the reduced state
and this is the oxidized state.

00:16:31.290 --> 00:16:36.950
And NADH is going to reduce
this ketone to an alcohol.

00:16:36.950 --> 00:16:39.225
And it itself becomes oxidized.

00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:50.090
NADH loses a hydron and
a proton to form NAD,

00:16:50.090 --> 00:16:57.200
and you generate
lactic acid where

00:16:57.200 --> 00:17:01.110
this hydrogen from
the NAD as a hydride

00:17:01.110 --> 00:17:06.800
is going to get transferred
to the carbon of the carbonyl.

00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:11.560
And this proton in some
way comes from solution,

00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:15.550
and has picked up a proton from
the active site of the enzyme.

00:17:15.550 --> 00:17:18.930
Now another point
I wanted to make,

00:17:18.930 --> 00:17:21.770
which you will encounter again
over the course of thinking

00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:26.130
about coupling
reactions in metabolism

00:17:26.130 --> 00:17:31.860
to make them favorable, is
that with NAD/NADH cofactor,

00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:34.500
you always have to
think about the proton.

00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:37.650
So you need a proton to
have a balanced equation.

00:17:37.650 --> 00:17:43.120
That means that if you're
at pH 6 versus pH 8,

00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:46.630
the concentration of the
species changes dramatically.

00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:48.510
And that can affect
where the equilibrium

00:17:48.510 --> 00:17:50.550
of the overall reaction lies.

00:17:50.550 --> 00:17:53.800
So you need to keep in the
back of your mind there's

00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:58.210
a proton with NAD/NADH systems.

00:17:58.210 --> 00:18:02.050
And so this is NAD,
but it turns out

00:18:02.050 --> 00:18:08.620
that flavins can also catalyze
the same type of reaction.

00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:13.960
So in the case of this
particular enzyme,

00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:15.570
it's found in
eukaryotic systems,

00:18:15.570 --> 00:18:18.200
it's found also in
prokaryotic systems.

00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:20.410
But in the case of the
flavin dependent enzymes,

00:18:20.410 --> 00:18:23.130
it's only found in
bacterial systems.

00:18:23.130 --> 00:18:26.742
And so their reaction goes
more favorably in the direction

00:18:26.742 --> 00:18:28.200
I'm writing it now,
but again, it's

00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:32.490
an equilibrium reaction where
you take lactate-- so this

00:18:32.490 --> 00:18:35.050
is now the reduced state.

00:18:35.050 --> 00:18:38.470
And so you now have FMN.

00:18:41.010 --> 00:18:43.730
So this is the form
of the cofactor that's

00:18:43.730 --> 00:18:45.800
used with this specific
enzyme, but the chemistry

00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:49.170
is same with FMN and FAD.

00:18:49.170 --> 00:18:50.820
And so this needs
to get oxidized.

00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:56.050
And it gets oxidized
to form pyruvate.

00:18:56.050 --> 00:19:02.040
And the FMN gets
reduced to form FMNH2.

00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:05.940
So both of these are capable
of catalyzing the same redox

00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:06.540
chemistry.

00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:09.050
And this is consistent
with what I've

00:19:09.050 --> 00:19:11.300
told you before about
the redox potential.

00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:15.100
So NAD/NADH is always
in this region.

00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:19.010
But you can see
that FAD/FADH2 also

00:19:19.010 --> 00:19:20.940
covers that region as well.

00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:25.130
So many of the chemistries
between these two cofactors

00:19:25.130 --> 00:19:26.900
can be overlapping.

00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:32.270
And you'll see this in for
example, fatty acid oxidation

00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:34.470
and fatty acid biosynthesis.

00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:38.840
And it really is not clear
at all which one of the redox

00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:40.080
chemistry you could use.

00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:43.910
Nature, in fact could
use different cofactors

00:19:43.910 --> 00:19:45.420
in different organisms.

00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:48.350
But we know what the
cofactors are in human systems

00:19:48.350 --> 00:19:50.360
because we purified
all the enzymes

00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:53.470
and study the
cofactor requirements.

00:19:53.470 --> 00:19:57.020
So this is the reaction
I want to focus on.

00:19:57.020 --> 00:19:59.470
And what I forgot to
tell you to maybe make

00:19:59.470 --> 00:20:01.980
this more relevant
to some of you

00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:04.310
I guess, since this is
what you do when you go

00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:09.750
to college nowadays, is most
of you have heard about yeast,

00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:12.850
that under anaerobic
conditions make you a friend,

00:20:12.850 --> 00:20:17.100
to make you happy
and cheery when

00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:19.600
you're having
tough times at MIT,

00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:21.110
you want to drink some ethanol.

00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:23.420
Yeast are able to
convert glucose

00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:26.810
all the way down under anaerobic
conditions into ethanol,

00:20:26.810 --> 00:20:31.470
and in fact uses the cofactor
NADH to in two steps,

00:20:31.470 --> 00:20:35.270
convert pyruvate into a
molecule called acid aldehyde.

00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:38.490
And then the NADH
converts the acid aldehyde

00:20:38.490 --> 00:20:44.740
into ethanol, which is the major
ingredient of beer and wine.

00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:47.890
So what I want to do
now is very briefly then

00:20:47.890 --> 00:20:54.190
focus on the chemistry of
how NADH actually works.

00:20:54.190 --> 00:20:56.820
So if we're now going to
look at the chemistry of this

00:20:56.820 --> 00:21:02.560
and the mechanism, let's
start with pyruvate.

00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:04.190
And you need to go
back and you need

00:21:04.190 --> 00:21:06.030
to think about the
carbonyl chemistry you've

00:21:06.030 --> 00:21:08.930
been introduced to when talking
about the claisen reaction

00:21:08.930 --> 00:21:11.070
and the aldol reaction.

00:21:11.070 --> 00:21:14.560
And we spent a lot of
time on carbonyl chemistry

00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:18.930
because it's central to
everything in biochemistry.

00:21:18.930 --> 00:21:23.000
And so you remember
that a carbonyl

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.730
is polarized where the electrons
like to result on the oxygen,

00:21:26.730 --> 00:21:29.750
leaving a deficiency
of electrons

00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:32.050
on the carbon of the carbonyl.

00:21:32.050 --> 00:21:35.130
And so one can draw
a resonant structure.

00:21:35.130 --> 00:21:36.950
This is the
predominate structure,

00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:41.390
but these resonance structures
often tell you something

00:21:41.390 --> 00:21:46.640
about where the molecule
is most reactive.

00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:50.790
And so what we've done is
oxygen is electro negative

00:21:50.790 --> 00:21:54.400
and likes to can accommodate
electrons in its orbitals.

00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:56.210
So it forms a
resonance structure

00:21:56.210 --> 00:21:58.660
like this leaving behind
electron deficiency

00:21:58.660 --> 00:22:00.040
at the carbon.

00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:05.240
And so we want to reduce
this carbonyl to an alcohol.

00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:13.020
And this is done with the
reduced form of the cofactor.

00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:15.830
So again, in every
redox chemistry,

00:22:15.830 --> 00:22:19.880
this is the oxidized form,
this is the reduced form.

00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:22.670
And so now the question is,
how does this chemistry happen?

00:22:22.670 --> 00:22:26.250
So let me point
out here-- and this

00:22:26.250 --> 00:22:28.540
is something you will hear
about over and over again

00:22:28.540 --> 00:22:34.270
in basic metabolism-- but
these two hydrogens-- and this

00:22:34.270 --> 00:22:38.430
is the 1, 2, 3, 4 position of
the nicotinamide ring are not

00:22:38.430 --> 00:22:39.010
equivalent.

00:22:39.010 --> 00:22:41.020
And why aren't they equivalent?

00:22:41.020 --> 00:22:43.530
They're not equivalent
because all of the chemistry

00:22:43.530 --> 00:22:48.900
happens in the active site
of an enzyme that is chiral.

00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:51.460
So these hydrogens
are prochiral.

00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:54.530
And because they sit in
a chiral environment,

00:22:54.530 --> 00:22:57.510
that makes these hydrogens
act like they're chiral.

00:22:57.510 --> 00:23:01.560
So all chemistry with
NADH is stereo specific.

00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:05.430
Depending on the active site,
only one of these two protons

00:23:05.430 --> 00:23:09.190
is involved in hydride transfer.

00:23:09.190 --> 00:23:11.540
So if you look at
the chemistry now,

00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:15.750
we're set up to deliver a
proton with a pair of electrons,

00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:21.230
that's a hydride, to this
carbon of the carbonyl.

00:23:21.230 --> 00:23:25.330
See we have a hydride transfer.

00:23:25.330 --> 00:23:31.000
And now we have the electron
density sitting on the oxygen.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:34.260
And so likely then in the
active site of the enzyme

00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:36.890
you have a general
acid catalyst which is

00:23:36.890 --> 00:23:39.360
able to then donate a proton.

00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:42.230
And remember I told
you that NAD/NADH

00:23:42.230 --> 00:23:46.100
involves hydride transfer
and proton transfer.

00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:51.910
So what you generate
then is OH, where

00:23:51.910 --> 00:23:55.260
this hydrogen comes from
a general acid catalyst

00:23:55.260 --> 00:23:57.670
in the active site.

00:23:57.670 --> 00:24:04.260
And you have the hydride
transfer coming from the NADH

00:24:04.260 --> 00:24:06.610
to generate lactic acid.

00:24:06.610 --> 00:24:14.750
And now what you've generated
is the oxidized form of the NAD.

00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:21.060
So reduced form oxidized,
reduced form oxidized.

00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:26.040
So this is the general reaction
and all NAD/NADH enzymes

00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:30.890
involves this simple type of
[INAUDIBLE], protons, hydrides,

00:24:30.890 --> 00:24:32.650
and protons.

00:24:32.650 --> 00:24:35.940
Now what I want
to do is show you

00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:37.960
one of the many
types of reactions

00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:39.820
that flavins can undergo.

00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:44.080
And again we're focusing on
hydride transfer reactions.

00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:49.440
And a recall for you
that again, the redox

00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:54.320
potentials of the flavins
in the NAD/NADH overlap.

00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:56.430
So this is always minus 320.

00:24:56.430 --> 00:24:59.790
But this has a span
of redox potentials.

00:24:59.790 --> 00:25:01.330
And in fact, what
you will see when

00:25:01.330 --> 00:25:11.330
you look at basic metabolism is
often FAD is reduced by NADH.

00:25:11.330 --> 00:25:15.390
And so these two partner
up to do chemistry.

00:25:15.390 --> 00:25:18.370
And so what I want to do now
is show you the chemistry

00:25:18.370 --> 00:25:22.260
with the flavin and NADH.

00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:35.590
If we go back and we look at
our oxidized form of the flavin,

00:25:35.590 --> 00:25:38.790
and again, I'm not going to
draw out all the structure.

00:25:38.790 --> 00:25:41.050
And remember there's
a lot of spinach here

00:25:41.050 --> 00:25:43.210
and there's also
some spinach here.

00:25:43.210 --> 00:25:45.770
This is the business
end of the molecule.

00:25:45.770 --> 00:25:49.220
And remember I told you the
business end of the molecule

00:25:49.220 --> 00:25:52.850
is the N5 and the C4A position.

00:25:52.850 --> 00:25:55.940
And so now we have our NAD.

00:25:59.770 --> 00:26:01.170
NADH, sorry.

00:26:01.170 --> 00:26:05.850
So this is the oxidized form,
this is the reduced form.

00:26:05.850 --> 00:26:10.640
And so NAD/NADH goes through
a hydride proton transfers,

00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:12.406
does it stereo specifically.

00:26:12.406 --> 00:26:14.280
And the question is,
where does the chemistry

00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:16.510
happen with the flavin?

00:26:16.510 --> 00:26:20.950
And the chemistry happens
at stereo specifically.

00:26:20.950 --> 00:26:22.610
So each enzyme
will be different.

00:26:22.610 --> 00:26:24.580
You can figure out what
the stereo chemistry

00:26:24.580 --> 00:26:28.070
is at the N5 position.

00:26:28.070 --> 00:26:30.510
So here is again,
the N5 position.

00:26:30.510 --> 00:26:36.530
So you have hydride
transfer to the N5 position.

00:26:36.530 --> 00:26:41.130
And now you can pick up a
proton or not at this position.

00:26:41.130 --> 00:26:42.440
I'm going to show you the PKA.

00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:45.200
If you go back and you look
at the handout in the lexicon,

00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:47.010
you'll see the PKA
of this nitrogen

00:26:47.010 --> 00:26:50.080
is under physiological
conditions, about 7.

00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:53.370
So it can be proteinated
or not proteinated.

00:26:53.370 --> 00:27:04.760
And so what then happens is you
end up with the reduced form

00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:11.140
where this hydrogen is
transferred to the N5 position,

00:27:11.140 --> 00:27:15.210
and you could pick up a hydrogen
here, from AH leaving you

00:27:15.210 --> 00:27:22.910
with A. So this proton,
this may or may not

00:27:22.910 --> 00:27:28.510
be proteinated depending on
the active site of the enzyme.

00:27:28.510 --> 00:27:30.760
And so then what
you also have here

00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:35.650
is the oxidized form of NADH.

00:27:35.650 --> 00:27:37.930
Now those of you who
were paying attention

00:27:37.930 --> 00:27:42.810
to what I was just saying
with the reduction of pyruvate

00:27:42.810 --> 00:27:47.690
to lactate, I just went
through this whole big spiel

00:27:47.690 --> 00:27:51.680
about how you wanted to
take advantage of the fact

00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:54.700
that carbonyl is a polarized
delta plus delta minus,

00:27:54.700 --> 00:27:57.110
and that the nucleophile,
this case the hydride,

00:27:57.110 --> 00:28:01.290
is always being transferred to
the electron deficient carbon,

00:28:01.290 --> 00:28:04.610
not to the oxygen that already
has a lot of electron density.

00:28:04.610 --> 00:28:06.940
So you might be
asking yourself well,

00:28:06.940 --> 00:28:13.320
why doesn't that hydride get
transferred to this position?

00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:16.530
This is a position,
if you look at this,

00:28:16.530 --> 00:28:20.740
and you take it out of context
of the isoalloxazine ring.

00:28:20.740 --> 00:28:23.870
This looks remarkably
similar to this carbonyl.

00:28:23.870 --> 00:28:28.702
And in fact, this is where your
chemical intuition falls apart.

00:28:28.702 --> 00:28:30.160
And you need to
know that you don't

00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:32.200
have chemical intuition
about those people that

00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:36.500
spent 40 years studying
isoalloxazine rings.

00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:40.100
And this is a complex
heterocyclical molecule

00:28:40.100 --> 00:28:41.850
where I think most
chemists, when

00:28:41.850 --> 00:28:43.310
looking at this
for the first time,

00:28:43.310 --> 00:28:47.470
had no clue as to what the
reactive positions were

00:28:47.470 --> 00:28:48.860
and what the chemistry was.

00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:52.680
And they spent, in
the 1970s and 1980s,

00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:56.680
spent a decade figuring out
the chemistry of flavins.

00:28:56.680 --> 00:29:00.360
And so I'm telling you
what the answer is.

00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:02.920
There is experimental
evidence that supports this

00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:05.460
that in the case
of NADH, hydride

00:29:05.460 --> 00:29:08.690
is transferred to
the N5 position

00:29:08.690 --> 00:29:15.360
to give you the reduced form
and the oxidized form of NAD.

00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:18.600
So I hope I've
gotten you excited

00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:22.440
interested about the two redox
active cofactors that you're

00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:25.930
going to encounter over and
over again during your journey

00:29:25.930 --> 00:29:30.120
through primary metabolic
pathways, FAD and NAD.

00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:33.920
And I hope I've
taught you something

00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:38.420
about the chemistry of how
these two cofactors work

00:29:38.420 --> 00:29:40.420
and you'll get
plenty of practice

00:29:40.420 --> 00:29:43.850
with these cofactors over
the rest of the semester.

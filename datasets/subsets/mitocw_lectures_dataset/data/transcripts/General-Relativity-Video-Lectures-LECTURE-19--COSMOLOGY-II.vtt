SCOTT HUGHES: So in the lectures
I'm going to record today,

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.570
we're going to
conclude cosmology.

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.710
And then we're going to begin
talking about a another system

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.140
in which we saw the
Einstein field equations

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:22.860
using asymmetry.

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.320
So this is one
where we will again

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.622
consider systems that
are spherically symmetric

00:00:27.622 --> 00:00:29.580
but we're going to consider
them to be compact.

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.080
In other words,
things that are sort

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.003
of, rather than filling
the whole universe,

00:00:33.003 --> 00:00:34.920
the spacetime that arises
from a source that's

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.220
localized in some
particular region in space.

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:39.990
So let me just do a
quick recap of what

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:45.270
we did in the previous
lecture that I recorded.

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.920
So by arguing solely
from the basis of how

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:56.010
to make a spacetime that is as
symmetric as possible in space

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.340
but has a time asymmetry,
so the past and the future

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.840
look different, we came up with
the Robertson-Walker metric,

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.777
which I will call the RW metric,
which has the form I've written

00:01:06.777 --> 00:01:07.860
there on the top one line.

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.900
There were actually
several forms for this.

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.320
I've actually written down two
variants of it on the board

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.180
here.

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.100
Key thing which I
want to highlight

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.500
is that there is, in
the way I've written it

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.000
on the first line, there's a
hidden scale in there, r zero,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.800
which you can think
of as, essentially,

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.900
setting an overall length
scale to everything

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.850
that could be measured.

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.210
There is a parameter,
either k or kappa.

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.730
k is either minus 1, 0, or 1.

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:43.170
Kappa is just k with a factor
of that length scale squared

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.470
thrown in there.

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.180
We define the overall
scale factor to be--

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.360
it's a number.

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.100
And we define it so that
its value is 1 right now.

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.790
And then everything is scaled
to the way distances look

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.730
at the present time.

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:01.117
A second form of that--

00:02:01.117 --> 00:02:03.450
excuse me-- which is essentially
the change of variables

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.620
is you change your
radial coordinates

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:10.880
to this parameter chi.

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.830
And depending on
the value of k, what

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.200
you find then is
that the relationship

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:23.340
between the radius r and the
coordinate chi, if k equals 1,

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.440
you have what we call
a closed universe.

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:31.080
And the radius is equal to
the sign of the parameter chi.

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:36.540
If you have an open
universe, k equals minus 1,

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.881
then the radius is the
sinh of that parameter chi.

00:02:40.881 --> 00:02:43.890
And for a flat
universe, k equals 0,

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:48.050
they are simply 1 is just the
other modulo, a choice of units

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:49.980
with the R of 0 there.

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.740
All this is just geometry.

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:52.240
OK.

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.980
So when you write
this down, you are

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.060
agnostic about the form of a
and you have no information

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.720
about the value of k.

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.170
So to get more insight
into what's going on,

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:08.800
you need to couple
this to your source.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.650
And so we take these things.

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.660
And using the Einstein
field equations,

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:18.540
you equate these to a perfect
fluid stress energy tensor.

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.130
What pops out of that
are a pair of equations

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.470
that arise in the
Einstein field equations.

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:26.880
I call these F1 and F2.

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.100
These are the two
Friedmann equations.

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.455
F1 tells me about the velocity
associated with that expansion

00:03:32.455 --> 00:03:32.955
premise.

00:03:32.955 --> 00:03:35.490
There's an a dot
divided by a squared.

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:38.550
We call that the Hubble
parameter, h of a squared.

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:41.880
And it's related to the density
of the source of your universe

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.580
as well as this kappa term.

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:44.100
OK.

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:48.660
And as we saw last time,
we can get some information

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.670
about kappa from this equation.

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.110
The second Friedmann equation
relates the acceleration

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.300
of this expansion
term, a double dot--

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.430
dot, by the way, d by dy.

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.490
A double dot divided
by a is simply

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:05.730
related to a quantity
that is the density plus 3

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:08.430
times the pressure of this
perfect fluid that makes up

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.110
our universe.

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:14.220
We also find by requiring that
local energy conservation be

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.470
held, in other words that
your stress energy tensor be

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.500
divergence free, we
have a constraint that

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.899
relates the amount of energy--

00:04:21.899 --> 00:04:24.450
the rate of change of energy
in a fiducial volume--

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:28.200
to the negative pressure
times the rate of change

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.910
of that fiducial volume.

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:32.220
And this, as I discussed
in the last lecture,

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.830
is essentially nothing
more than the first law

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:36.030
of thermodynamics.

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:37.920
It's written up
in fancy language

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:41.055
appropriate to a
cosmological spacetime.

00:04:41.055 --> 00:04:42.930
As we move forward, we
find it useful to make

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:45.090
a couple of definitions.

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:48.480
So if you divide the
Hubble parameter squared

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:50.160
by Newton's
gravitational constant,

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.320
that's got the
dimensions of density.

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:56.030
And so we're going to define
a critical density to be 3h

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:57.840
squared over 8 pi g.

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:02.850
And we're going to define
density parameters, omega,

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:05.350
as the actual physical
density is normalized

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:06.900
to that critical density.

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:10.530
And when you do this, you
find that the critical--

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:13.700
the first Friedmann equation
can be written as omega--

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:15.470
oh, that's a typo--

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:21.070
omega plus omega
curvature equals

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:26.410
1 where omega curvature--
pardon the typo here.

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:31.420
Omega curvature is not
actually related to identity

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:34.630
but it sort of plays
one in this equation.

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:38.170
It is just a parameter that
has the proper dimensions

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:42.160
to do what is necessary
to fit this equation.

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:46.540
And it only depends on what
the curvature parameter is.

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:49.840
So remember that this
kappa is essentially

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:53.480
minus 1, 0, or 1 module of
factor of my overall scale.

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:55.840
So this is either a
positive number, 0,

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:58.880
or a negative number.

00:05:58.880 --> 00:05:59.650
All right.

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:02.470
So let's carry things
forward from here.

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:06.520
Mute my computer so I'm not
distracted by things coming in.

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:15.250
We now have everything we
need using this framework

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:18.130
to build a universe.

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:21.420
Let's write down the
recipe to build a universe,

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:23.934
or I should say to build
a model of the universe.

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:37.823
So first thing you do is
pick your spatial curvature.

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:57.740
So pick the parameter k
to be minus 1, 0, or 1.

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:19.590
Pick a mixture of
species that contribute

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:24.250
to the energy density budget
of your model universe.

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:27.480
So what you would say is that
the total density of things

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:31.650
in your universe is a sum
over whatever mixture of stuff

00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:33.098
is in your universe.

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:40.340
You will find it helpful to
specify an equation of state

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:41.750
for each species.

00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:43.823
Cosmologists typically
choose equation of state

00:07:43.823 --> 00:07:44.990
that has the following form.

00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:01.390
OK.

00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:03.070
So you require your species--

00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:07.060
if you follow this model
that most cosmologists use,

00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:08.800
each species will
have a pressure

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:10.590
that is linear in the density.

00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:25.950
If you do choose
that form, then when

00:08:25.950 --> 00:08:31.590
you enforce local conservation
of energy, what you will then

00:08:31.590 --> 00:08:45.860
find is that for every
one of your species,

00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:50.567
there is a simple relationship.

00:08:50.567 --> 00:08:52.150
There's a simple
differential equation

00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:54.280
that governs how
that species evolves

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:56.680
as the scale factor changes.

00:08:56.680 --> 00:09:02.920
This can be immediately
integrated up

00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:06.010
to find that the amount of,
at some particular moment,

00:09:06.010 --> 00:09:09.400
the density of species i
depends on how it looks.

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:12.440
So 0 again denotes now.

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:16.930
It is simply proportional to
some power of the scale factor

00:09:16.930 --> 00:09:27.270
where the power that enters
here can be simply calculated

00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:29.740
given that equation
of state parameter.

00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:38.210
Once you have these things
together, you're ready to roll.

00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:39.710
You've got your
Friedmann equations.

00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:42.230
You've got all the
constraints and information

00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:45.680
you need to dig into
these equations.

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:48.820
Sit down, make your
models, have a party.

00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:52.180
Now what we really want to do--

00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:52.680
OK.

00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:55.050
We are physicists.

00:09:55.050 --> 00:09:57.690
And our goal in
doing these models

00:09:57.690 --> 00:10:02.310
is to come up with some kind of
a description of the universe

00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:04.530
and compare it with
our data so that we

00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:07.020
can see what is the
nature of the universe

00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:09.220
that we actually live in.

00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:09.720
OK.

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:18.490
So what is of interest to
us is how does varying all

00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:28.313
these different terms change--

00:10:28.313 --> 00:10:30.480
well, we're going to talk
about various observables.

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:32.850
But really, if you
think about this model,

00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:35.250
how does it change the
evolution of the scale factor?

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:44.605
Everything is bound up in that.

00:10:44.605 --> 00:10:46.340
That is the key thing.

00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:46.840
OK.

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:49.872
So if I can make a
mathematical model that

00:10:49.872 --> 00:10:52.330
describes a universe with all
these various different kinds

00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:56.968
of ingredients, yeah, I
can sit down and make--

00:10:56.968 --> 00:10:58.510
if I make a really
complicated thing,

00:10:58.510 --> 00:11:01.150
I probably can't do this
analytically so that's fine.

00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:02.740
I will make a
differential equation

00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:05.530
integrator that solves all these
coupled differential equations.

00:11:05.530 --> 00:11:10.030
And I will then make predictions
for how AFT evolves depending

00:11:10.030 --> 00:11:12.190
upon what the different
mixtures of species are,

00:11:12.190 --> 00:11:14.890
what the curvature
term is equal to,

00:11:14.890 --> 00:11:18.140
all those together,
and make my model.

00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:20.810
But my goal as a physicist is
then to compare this to data.

00:11:20.810 --> 00:11:25.240
And so what I need to do is to
come up with some kind of a way

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:28.750
this will then be useful.

00:11:28.750 --> 00:11:47.630
We then need some kind of
an observational surrogate

00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:49.210
for a of t.

00:11:49.210 --> 00:11:50.960
What I would like to
be able to do is say,

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:54.230
great, model A predicts
the following evolution

00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:55.070
of the scale factor.

00:11:55.070 --> 00:11:58.370
Model B predicts this
evolution of the scale factor.

00:11:58.370 --> 00:12:00.560
Can I look at the
universe and deduce

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:04.110
whether we are closer to
model A or closer to Model B?

00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:05.960
And in order to do
that, I need to know

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:08.007
how do I measure a of t.

00:12:08.007 --> 00:12:09.590
And as we're going
to see, this really

00:12:09.590 --> 00:12:13.500
boils down to two things.

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:16.860
I need to be able
to deduce if I look

00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:19.710
at some event in the universe,
if I look at something,

00:12:19.710 --> 00:12:23.010
I want to know what scale
factor to associate with that.

00:12:23.010 --> 00:12:24.540
I need to measure a.

00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:28.580
And I need to know what
t to label that a with.

00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:33.240
So this kind of sounds
like I'm reading

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:34.850
from the journal of duh.

00:12:34.850 --> 00:12:37.350
But if I want to do this, what
it basically boils down to is

00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:40.980
I need to know how to associate
an a with things that I measure

00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:43.747
and how to associate the t
with the things that I measure.

00:12:43.747 --> 00:12:45.580
That's what we're going
to talk about today.

00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:48.360
What are the actual
observational surrogates,

00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:52.590
the ways in which we can
go out, point telescopes

00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:54.960
and other instruments
at things in the sky,

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:58.530
and deduce what a of t is
for the kind of events,

00:12:58.530 --> 00:13:00.690
the kind of things that
we are going to measure?

00:13:05.890 --> 00:13:08.550
Let's talk about how I can
measure the scale factor first.

00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:08.730
OK.

00:13:08.730 --> 00:13:10.605
So let's ignore the fact
there's a t on here.

00:13:10.605 --> 00:13:12.060
How can I measure a?

00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:16.440
We saw a hint of this
in the previous lecture

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:18.150
that I recorded.

00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:21.770
So recall-- pardon me.

00:13:21.770 --> 00:13:27.410
I've got a bit of extra
junk here in my notes.

00:13:27.410 --> 00:13:35.010
Recall that in my
previous lecture,

00:13:35.010 --> 00:13:38.890
we looked at the way different
kinds of densities behaved.

00:13:38.890 --> 00:13:40.600
But I've got the
results right here.

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:46.100
For matter which had an
equation state parameter of 0,

00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:52.030
what we found was that
the density associated

00:13:52.030 --> 00:13:54.850
with that matter, it just
fell as the scale factor

00:13:54.850 --> 00:13:56.440
to the inverse third power.

00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:59.020
That's essentially saying
that the number of particles

00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:01.360
of stuff is constant.

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:04.780
And so as the universe
expands, it just

00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:07.030
goes with the volume
of the universe.

00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:10.420
If it was radiation, we found
it went as a scale factor

00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:12.460
to the inverse fourth power.

00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:14.980
And that's consistent
with diluting the density

00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:19.600
as the volume gets larger
provided we also decrease

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:23.530
the energy per particle
of radiation per photon,

00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:26.980
per graviton, per whateveron.

00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:32.650
If I require that the energy
per quantum of radiation

00:14:32.650 --> 00:14:40.150
is redshifted with this thing,
that explains the density flaw

00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:42.100
that we found for radiation.

00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:45.250
And so that sort of suggests
that what we're going to find

00:14:45.250 --> 00:14:47.080
is that the scale
factor is directly

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:49.330
tied to a redshift measure.

00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:50.737
OK.

00:14:50.737 --> 00:14:52.570
I just realized what
this page of notes was.

00:14:52.570 --> 00:14:53.200
My apologies.

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:54.617
I'm getting myself
organized here.

00:14:59.642 --> 00:15:01.600
Let's make that a little
bit more rigorous now.

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:02.100
OK.

00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:06.120
So that argument on the basis
of how the density of radiation

00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:06.620
behaves.

00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:08.200
It's not a bad one
as a first pass.

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:10.270
It is quite indicative.

00:15:10.270 --> 00:15:12.400
But let's come at it from
another point of view.

00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:18.840
And this allows me to
introduce in a brief

00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:25.690
aside a topic that
is quite useful here.

00:15:25.690 --> 00:15:31.210
So we talked about Killing
vectors a couple of weeks ago.

00:15:31.210 --> 00:15:33.330
Let's now talk about a
generalization of this

00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:35.760
known as Killing tensors.

00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:38.130
So recall that a
Killing vector was

00:15:38.130 --> 00:15:42.210
defined as a particular
vector in my space time

00:15:42.210 --> 00:15:45.810
manifold such that
if I Lie transport

00:15:45.810 --> 00:15:50.040
the metric along that
Killing vector, I get 0.

00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:55.110
This then leads to the
statement that if I put together

00:15:55.110 --> 00:16:03.870
the symmetrized covariant
gradient of the Killing vector,

00:16:03.870 --> 00:16:06.820
I get 0.

00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:09.300
Another way to write this
is to use this notation.

00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:09.800
Whoops.

00:16:17.122 --> 00:16:18.130
OK.

00:16:18.130 --> 00:16:20.230
So these are equations
that tell us about the way

00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:23.480
that Killing vectors behave.

00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:26.020
A Killing tensor is
just a generalization

00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:31.090
of this idea to an object
that has more than one index

00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:37.090
line, to a higher
rank tensorial object.

00:16:37.090 --> 00:16:41.720
So we consider this to be
a rank one Killing tensor.

00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:54.610
A rank n Killing
tensor satisfies--

00:16:59.310 --> 00:17:01.230
so let's say k is
my Killing tensor.

00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:12.359
Imagine I have n
indices here if I

00:17:12.359 --> 00:17:16.020
take the covariant gradient
of that Killing tensor

00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:19.079
and I symmetrize
over all n indices.

00:17:19.079 --> 00:17:20.250
That gives me 0.

00:17:20.250 --> 00:17:22.020
This defines a Killing tensor.

00:17:28.410 --> 00:17:35.920
Starting with this
definition, it's not at all

00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:58.980
hard to show that if I
define a parameter, k,

00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:01.680
which is what I get when
I contract the Killing

00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:06.240
tensor, every one of its
indices with the four-velocity

00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:07.170
of a geodesic.

00:18:23.030 --> 00:18:26.923
If my u satisfies the geodesic
equation-- or this could be--

00:18:26.923 --> 00:18:28.215
let's write this as a momentum.

00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:37.380
Which you say is the
tangent to a world line.

00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:39.270
Could be either a
velocity or a momentum.

00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:47.910
So if I define the scalar
k by contracting my Killing

00:18:47.910 --> 00:18:52.560
tensor with n copies of
tangent to the world line,

00:18:52.560 --> 00:19:02.920
and that thing satisfies
the geodesic equation,

00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:05.320
then the following is true.

00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:07.870
You guys did this on
a homework exercise

00:19:07.870 --> 00:19:12.340
for when we thought about a
spacetime-- you did something

00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:16.040
similar to this, I should say,
for a spacetime containing

00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:17.110
an electromagnetic field.

00:19:17.110 --> 00:19:19.690
We talked about how this works
for the case of a Killing

00:19:19.690 --> 00:19:20.908
vector.

00:19:20.908 --> 00:19:22.450
Hopefully you can
kind of see the way

00:19:22.450 --> 00:19:25.480
you would do this
calculation at this point.

00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:28.060
Now the reason I'm
doing this aside

00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:31.630
is that if you have a
Friedmann-Robertson-Walker

00:19:31.630 --> 00:19:37.350
spacetime, search
spacetimes actually

00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:39.360
have a very useful
Killing tensor.

00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:53.250
So let's define k with
two indices, mu nu.

00:19:53.250 --> 00:19:55.710
And this is just given
by the scale factor.

00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:05.780
Multiplying the metric
u mu, u mu, u nu.

00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:15.780
Where this u comes
from the four-velocity

00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:17.190
of a co-moving fluid element.

00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:26.440
So this is the
four-velocity that we

00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:27.970
use to construct
the stress energy

00:20:27.970 --> 00:20:33.013
tensor that is the source
of our Friedmann equations.

00:20:42.510 --> 00:20:45.140
So here's how we're
going to use this.

00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:50.020
Let's look at what we get
for this Killing vector.

00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:54.710
Excuse me, this Killing
tensor when I consider

00:20:54.710 --> 00:20:58.130
it's a long a null geodesic.

00:20:58.130 --> 00:21:00.890
We're going to want to think
about null geodesics a lot,

00:21:00.890 --> 00:21:06.980
because the way that we are
going to probe our universe

00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:07.820
is with radiation.

00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:10.070
We're going to look at it
with things like telescopes.

00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:17.290
These days people are
starting to probe it

00:21:17.290 --> 00:21:19.207
with things like
gravitational wave detectors.

00:21:19.207 --> 00:21:22.590
All things that involve
radiation that moves on null

00:21:22.590 --> 00:21:23.230
geodesics.

00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:42.130
So let's examine the
associated conserved quantity

00:21:42.130 --> 00:21:44.054
that is associated
with a null geodesic.

00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:53.510
So let's say v--

00:21:53.510 --> 00:21:56.070
let's make it a p, actually.

00:21:56.070 --> 00:21:57.650
So it's going to
be a null geodesic,

00:21:57.650 --> 00:22:01.820
so we're going to imagine it's
radiation that is following.

00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:04.060
It has a four-momentum, pu.

00:22:07.150 --> 00:22:14.860
And let's define k, case of
ng, from my null geodesic.

00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:20.620
That is going to be
k mu nu, p mu, p nu.

00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:24.160
Let's plug-in the definition
of my Killing tensor.

00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:34.240
So this is a square root
of t, g mu nu, p nu, p nu.

00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:34.825
This is zero.

00:22:34.825 --> 00:22:35.700
It's a null geodesic.

00:22:48.410 --> 00:22:52.630
Then I get u mu p nu, u nu p mu.

00:22:52.630 --> 00:22:54.170
Now remind you of something.

00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:04.120
Go back to a nice
little Easter egg,

00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:08.330
an exercise you guys
did a long time ago.

00:23:08.330 --> 00:23:13.520
If I look at the dot
product of a four-momentum

00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:24.850
and a four-velocity, what I
get is the energy associated

00:23:24.850 --> 00:23:29.500
with that four-momentum as
measured by the observer whose

00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:32.730
four-velocity is u.

00:23:32.730 --> 00:23:34.890
So what we get
here is two copies

00:23:34.890 --> 00:23:39.210
of the energy of that
null geodesic measured

00:23:39.210 --> 00:23:41.430
by the observer
who is co-moving.

00:23:47.190 --> 00:23:50.070
So what this null geodesic--

00:23:50.070 --> 00:23:52.370
what this quantity associated
with this null geodesic

00:23:52.370 --> 00:23:57.800
is two powers of the scale
factor times the energy that

00:23:57.800 --> 00:24:02.600
would be measured by
someone who is co-moving

00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:04.877
with the fluid that
fills my universe.

00:24:25.290 --> 00:24:28.010
Energy of p mu, as
measured by u mu.

00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:39.590
And remember, this
is a constant.

00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:48.890
So as this radiation travels
across the universe--

00:25:13.370 --> 00:25:15.830
as this radiation travels
across the universe,

00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:19.700
the product of the scale
factor and the energy

00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:22.730
associated with that
radiation as measured

00:25:22.730 --> 00:25:25.265
by co-moving observers
is a constant.

00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:05.140
So this is telling
us that the energy,

00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:06.910
as measured by a
co-moving observer,

00:26:06.910 --> 00:26:11.560
let's say it is emitted at some
time with a scale factor is a.

00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:16.930
When it propagates to us, we
define our scale factor as 1,

00:26:16.930 --> 00:26:21.402
the energy will have fallen
down by a factor of 1 over a.

00:26:21.402 --> 00:26:23.860
So this makes it a little bit
more rigorous, this intuitive

00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:26.200
argument that we
saw from considering

00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:28.450
how the density of
radiation fell off.

00:26:28.450 --> 00:26:33.160
What we see is the energy
is indeed redshifting

00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:35.810
with the scale factor.

00:26:35.810 --> 00:26:41.350
So if I use the fact that
the energy that I observe--

00:26:45.150 --> 00:26:48.470
if I'm measuring light, light
has a frequency of omega--

00:26:51.470 --> 00:26:57.050
what I see is the omega
that I observe at my scale

00:26:57.050 --> 00:27:00.770
factor, which I define to
be 1, normalized to that

00:27:00.770 --> 00:27:09.660
when it was emitted, it
looks like the scale factor

00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:12.240
when it was admitted.

00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:16.740
Divided by a now, a observed.

00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:17.490
I call this 1.

00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:25.180
I can flip this
over, another way

00:27:25.180 --> 00:27:28.920
of saying this is
that, if I write it

00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:37.240
in terms of wavelengths of
the radiation, the wavelength

00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:41.710
of the radiation and when it was
emitted versus the wavelength

00:27:41.710 --> 00:27:45.850
that we observe it tells
me about the scale factor

00:27:45.850 --> 00:27:48.550
when the radiation was emitted.

00:28:02.010 --> 00:28:04.215
Astronomers like to
work with redshift.

00:28:06.780 --> 00:28:08.310
They like to work
with wavelength

00:28:08.310 --> 00:28:12.450
when they study things
like the spectra

00:28:12.450 --> 00:28:13.920
of distant astronomical objects.

00:28:17.890 --> 00:28:22.600
And they use it to define
a notion of redshift.

00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:27.730
So we define the redshift
z to be the wavelength

00:28:27.730 --> 00:28:32.020
that we observe, minus the
wavelength at the radiation

00:28:32.020 --> 00:28:36.010
that when it is emitted
divided by the wavelength when

00:28:36.010 --> 00:28:38.170
it was emitted.

00:28:38.170 --> 00:28:41.650
Put all of these
definitions together,

00:28:41.650 --> 00:28:43.990
and what this tells
me is that the scale

00:28:43.990 --> 00:28:50.340
factor at which the
radiation was emitted

00:28:50.340 --> 00:28:55.630
is simply related to the
redshift that we observe.

00:28:55.630 --> 00:29:00.690
So this at last gives us
a direct and not terribly

00:29:00.690 --> 00:29:02.910
difficult to use
observational proxy

00:29:02.910 --> 00:29:06.960
that directly encodes the
scale factor of our universe.

00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:23.060
Suppose we measure the spectrum
of radiation from some source,

00:29:23.060 --> 00:29:27.710
and we see the
distinct fingerprint

00:29:27.710 --> 00:29:30.740
associated with emission
from a particular set

00:29:30.740 --> 00:29:32.399
of atomic transitions.

00:29:38.390 --> 00:29:45.370
What we generally find is
some well-known fingerprints

00:29:45.370 --> 00:29:58.040
of well-characterized
transitions,

00:29:58.040 --> 00:30:17.938
but in general they are
stretched by some factor

00:30:17.938 --> 00:30:20.180
that we call the redshift z.

00:30:20.180 --> 00:30:22.680
Actually, you usually stretch
by-- when you go through this,

00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:23.720
you'll find that
what you measure

00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:25.300
is actually stretched
by 1 plus z.

00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:32.430
You measure that,
you have measured

00:30:32.430 --> 00:30:35.170
the scale factor at which
this radiation was measured--

00:30:35.170 --> 00:30:35.670
was emitted.

00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:52.360
So this is beautiful.

00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:54.450
This is a way in which
the universe hands

00:30:54.450 --> 00:31:02.010
us the tool by which we can
directly characterize some

00:31:02.010 --> 00:31:04.200
of the geometry of the
universe at which light

00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:05.772
has been emitted.

00:31:05.772 --> 00:31:07.230
This is actually
one of the reasons

00:31:07.230 --> 00:31:13.770
why a lot of people who do
observational cosmology also

00:31:13.770 --> 00:31:16.470
happen to be expert
atomic spectroscopists.

00:31:16.470 --> 00:31:19.260
Because you want to know
to very high precision what

00:31:19.260 --> 00:31:22.127
is the characteristics of
the hydrogen Balmer lines.

00:31:22.127 --> 00:31:24.210
Some of the most important
sources for doing these

00:31:24.210 --> 00:31:26.520
tend to be galaxies
in which there's

00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:29.520
a lot of matter falling onto
black holes, some of the topics

00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:32.520
we'll be talking about
in an upcoming video.

00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:34.830
As that material
falls in, it gets hot,

00:31:34.830 --> 00:31:36.780
it generates a lot of
radiation, and you'll

00:31:36.780 --> 00:31:39.990
see things like transition
lines associated

00:31:39.990 --> 00:31:42.180
with carbon and iron.

00:31:42.180 --> 00:31:45.455
But often all reddened
by a factor of several.

00:31:45.455 --> 00:31:46.830
You sort of go,
oh, look at that,

00:31:46.830 --> 00:31:51.450
carbon falling onto a
black hole at redshift 4.8.

00:31:51.450 --> 00:31:53.280
That is happening at
a time when the scale

00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:57.990
factor of the universe
was 1 over 4.8--

00:31:57.990 --> 00:32:00.560
or 1 over 5.8, forgot my
factor of 1 plus there.

00:32:03.890 --> 00:32:08.870
So you measure the
redshift, and you

00:32:08.870 --> 00:32:10.240
have measured the scale factor.

00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:17.710
But you don't know when
that light was emitted.

00:32:21.730 --> 00:32:24.400
We need to connect
the scale factor

00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:30.970
that we can measure so
directly and so beautifully

00:32:30.970 --> 00:32:34.870
to the time at which
it was emitted.

00:32:34.870 --> 00:32:37.490
We now have a way
of determining a,

00:32:37.490 --> 00:32:39.640
but we need a as
a function of t.

00:33:07.950 --> 00:33:11.100
And in truth, we do this
kind of via a surrogate.

00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:15.240
Because we are using
radiation as our tool

00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:18.000
for probing the scale
factor, we really

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.430
don't measure t directly.

00:33:20.430 --> 00:33:22.650
When we look at light
and it's coming to us,

00:33:22.650 --> 00:33:26.190
it doesn't say I
was emitted on March

00:33:26.190 --> 00:33:31.590
27th of the year
negative 6.8 billion

00:33:31.590 --> 00:33:34.380
BC, or something like that.

00:33:34.380 --> 00:33:37.140
We do know, though,
that it traveled

00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:39.970
towards us at the speed of
light on a null geodesic.

00:33:39.970 --> 00:33:42.120
And because it's
a null geodesic,

00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:43.730
there's a very simple--

00:33:43.730 --> 00:33:45.480
simple's a little bit
of an overstatement,

00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:49.800
but there is at least a
calculable connection.

00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:52.755
Because it's moving at the
speed of light, we can simply--

00:33:52.755 --> 00:33:54.150
I should stop using that word--

00:33:54.150 --> 00:33:58.440
we can connect time to space.

00:33:58.440 --> 00:34:00.360
And so rather than
directly determining

00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:02.940
the time at which the
radiation was emitted,

00:34:02.940 --> 00:34:07.463
we want to calculate the
distance of the source from us

00:34:07.463 --> 00:34:08.130
that emitted it.

00:34:41.170 --> 00:34:44.580
So rather than directly
building up a of t,

00:34:44.580 --> 00:34:47.520
we're going to build
up an a of d, where d

00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:50.540
is the distance of the source.

00:34:50.540 --> 00:34:52.739
And if you're used to working
in Euclidean geometry,

00:34:52.739 --> 00:34:54.540
you sort of go, ah, OK, great.

00:34:54.540 --> 00:34:57.570
I know that light travels
at the speed of light,

00:34:57.570 --> 00:35:00.180
so all I need to do is
divide the distance by c,

00:35:00.180 --> 00:35:03.900
and I've got the time,
and I build a of t.

00:35:03.900 --> 00:35:05.513
Conceptually, that
is roughly right,

00:35:05.513 --> 00:35:07.680
and that gives at least a
cartoon of the idea that's

00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:08.800
going on here.

00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:11.890
But we have to be a
little bit careful.

00:35:11.890 --> 00:35:15.330
Because it turns out when
you are making measurements

00:35:15.330 --> 00:35:21.900
in a curved space time, the
notion of distance that you use

00:35:21.900 --> 00:35:26.650
depends on how you make
the distance measurement.

00:35:26.650 --> 00:35:30.780
So this leads us now to our
discussion of distance measures

00:35:30.780 --> 00:35:32.661
in cosmological spacetime.

00:35:55.262 --> 00:35:56.970
So just to give a
little bit of intuition

00:35:56.970 --> 00:35:59.280
as to what's the
kind of calculation

00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:01.890
we're going to need to do,
let me describe one distance

00:36:01.890 --> 00:36:06.240
measure that is observation,
which is about useless,

00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:09.390
but not a bad thing
to at least begin

00:36:09.390 --> 00:36:15.540
to get a handle on, the
way different parameters

00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:17.400
of the spacetime
come in and influence

00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:19.450
what the distance measure is.

00:36:19.450 --> 00:36:22.800
So let's just think about
the proper distance from us

00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:23.460
to a source.

00:36:36.350 --> 00:36:40.770
So let's imagine that--

00:36:40.770 --> 00:36:44.110
well, let's just begin by
first, let's write down

00:36:44.110 --> 00:36:44.940
my line element.

00:36:44.940 --> 00:36:46.690
And here's the form
that I'm going to use.

00:36:57.640 --> 00:36:59.330
OK, so here's my line element.

00:36:59.330 --> 00:37:00.830
This is my
differential connection

00:37:00.830 --> 00:37:07.300
between two events spaced
between one another by dt,

00:37:07.300 --> 00:37:12.570
d chi, d theta, d phi, all
hidden in that angular element,

00:37:12.570 --> 00:37:13.070
the omega.

00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:19.970
Let's imagine that
we want to consider

00:37:19.970 --> 00:37:23.438
two sources that are separated
purely in the radial direction.

00:37:34.900 --> 00:37:37.422
So my angular displacement
between the two events

00:37:37.422 --> 00:37:38.130
is going to be 0.

00:37:40.860 --> 00:37:42.860
So the only thing I need
to care about is d chi,

00:37:42.860 --> 00:37:44.900
and let's imagine
that I determine

00:37:44.900 --> 00:37:48.560
the distance between these
two at some instant--

00:38:02.080 --> 00:38:04.810
So then you just get
ds squared equals

00:38:04.810 --> 00:38:08.200
a squared or zero squared d chi
squared, and you can integrate

00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:12.910
this up and you get our
first distance measure,

00:38:12.910 --> 00:38:18.760
d sub p equals scale factor.

00:38:18.760 --> 00:38:22.780
Your overall distance
scale are zero and chi.

00:38:26.370 --> 00:38:29.870
So Carroll's textbook calls
this the instantaneous physical

00:38:29.870 --> 00:38:30.370
distance.

00:38:43.950 --> 00:38:47.633
Let's think about what
this means if you do this.

00:38:47.633 --> 00:38:49.050
This is basically
the distance you

00:38:49.050 --> 00:38:52.140
would get if you
took a yardstick,

00:38:52.140 --> 00:38:54.150
you put one end at
yourself, you're

00:38:54.150 --> 00:38:56.100
going to call
yourself chi equals 0,

00:38:56.100 --> 00:38:57.960
you put the other
end of the yardstick

00:38:57.960 --> 00:39:01.200
at the object in your
universe at some distance

00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:04.260
chi in these coordinates,
and that's the distance.

00:39:04.260 --> 00:39:06.240
d sub p is the distance
that you measure.

00:39:13.370 --> 00:39:14.912
It is done, you're
sort of imagining

00:39:14.912 --> 00:39:17.120
that both of the events at
the end of this yardstick.

00:39:17.120 --> 00:39:19.328
You're sort of ascertaining
their position at exactly

00:39:19.328 --> 00:39:22.490
the same instant, hence
the term instantaneous,

00:39:22.490 --> 00:39:26.420
and you get something
out of it that

00:39:26.420 --> 00:39:30.050
encodes some important
aspects of how we think

00:39:30.050 --> 00:39:32.600
about distances in cosmology.

00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:37.490
So notice everything scales
with the overall length scale

00:39:37.490 --> 00:39:40.430
that we associated
with our spatial slices

00:39:40.430 --> 00:39:44.270
with our spatial sector
of this metric, the r0.

00:39:44.270 --> 00:39:49.350
Notice that whatever is going
on your scale factor, your a,

00:39:49.350 --> 00:39:51.380
your distance is
going to track that.

00:39:51.380 --> 00:39:53.818
As a consequence of
this, two objects

00:39:53.818 --> 00:39:55.610
that are sitting in
what we call the Hubble

00:39:55.610 --> 00:39:57.290
flow, in other words,
two objects that

00:39:57.290 --> 00:40:00.560
are co-moving with the
fluid that makes up

00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:03.150
the source of our universe.

00:40:03.150 --> 00:40:05.590
They have an apparent motion
with respect to each other.

00:40:19.420 --> 00:40:33.900
If I take the time
derivative of this,

00:40:33.900 --> 00:40:40.290
the apparent is just
a dot, or 0 chi,

00:40:40.290 --> 00:40:48.860
which is equal to the
Hubble parameter times dp.

00:40:48.860 --> 00:40:53.205
Recall that the Hubble
parameter is a dot over a,

00:40:53.205 --> 00:40:54.830
and if I'm doing this
right now, that's

00:40:54.830 --> 00:40:59.680
the value of the
Hubble parameter now.

00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:02.230
So this is the Hubble Expansion
Law, the very famous Hubble

00:41:02.230 --> 00:41:03.880
Expansion Law.

00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:05.613
So we can see it
hidden in this--

00:41:05.613 --> 00:41:07.030
not even really
hidden, it's quite

00:41:07.030 --> 00:41:09.550
apparent in this notion of
an instantaneous physical

00:41:09.550 --> 00:41:10.690
distance.

00:41:10.690 --> 00:41:12.620
Let me just finally
emphasize, though,

00:41:12.620 --> 00:41:15.070
that the instantanaeity
that is part

00:41:15.070 --> 00:41:25.860
of this object's name,
instantaneous measurements,

00:41:25.860 --> 00:41:27.210
are not done.

00:41:29.895 --> 00:41:31.630
As I said-- I mean,
this is it sounds

00:41:31.630 --> 00:41:33.630
like I'm being slightly
facetious, but it's not.

00:41:33.630 --> 00:41:36.195
The meaning of this
distance measure

00:41:36.195 --> 00:41:37.820
is, like I said, it's
a yardstick where

00:41:37.820 --> 00:41:41.070
I have an event at me, the
other end of my yardstick

00:41:41.070 --> 00:41:44.210
is at my cosmological event.

00:41:44.210 --> 00:41:46.900
Those are typically
separated by millions,

00:41:46.900 --> 00:41:49.410
billions of light years.

00:41:49.410 --> 00:41:50.490
Even if you could--

00:41:50.490 --> 00:41:52.740
OK, the facetious bit was
imagining it as a yardstick.

00:41:52.740 --> 00:41:54.630
But the non-facetious
point I want to make

00:41:54.630 --> 00:41:57.360
is we do not make instantaneous
measurements with that.

00:41:57.360 --> 00:42:00.420
When I measure an event that is
billions of light years away,

00:42:00.420 --> 00:42:02.790
I am of course
measuring it using light

00:42:02.790 --> 00:42:07.240
and I'm seeing light that was
emitted billions of years ago.

00:42:07.240 --> 00:42:08.880
So we need to think
a little bit more

00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:19.310
carefully about how
to define distance

00:42:19.310 --> 00:42:22.220
in terms of quantities
that really correspond

00:42:22.220 --> 00:42:23.930
to measurements we can make.

00:42:43.630 --> 00:42:49.120
And to get a little
intuition, here

00:42:49.120 --> 00:42:57.400
are three ways where, if you
were living in Euclidean space

00:42:57.400 --> 00:43:07.540
and you were looking at
light from distant objects,

00:43:07.540 --> 00:43:09.730
here are three ways that
you could define distance.

00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:23.560
So if spacetime were that
of special relativity--

00:43:23.560 --> 00:43:25.800
well, let's just say if
space were purely Euclidean.

00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:27.050
Let's just leave it like that.

00:43:45.350 --> 00:43:47.930
Here are three notions
that we could use.

00:43:47.930 --> 00:43:53.390
One, imagine there was
some source of radiation

00:43:53.390 --> 00:43:57.620
in the universe that you
understood so well that you

00:43:57.620 --> 00:44:02.950
knew its intrinsic luminosity.

00:44:02.950 --> 00:44:14.100
What you could do is compare
the intrinsic luminosity

00:44:14.100 --> 00:44:16.419
of a source to its
apparent brightness.

00:44:30.120 --> 00:44:34.125
So let's let f be the flux
we measure from the source.

00:44:41.790 --> 00:44:46.970
This will be related to
l, the luminosity, which--

00:44:50.300 --> 00:44:51.846
suspend disbelief
for a moment, we

00:44:51.846 --> 00:44:55.090
want to imagine that we
know it for some reason.

00:44:55.090 --> 00:44:59.000
And if we imagine this
is an isotropic emitter,

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:03.110
this will be related
by a factor of 4 pi,

00:45:03.110 --> 00:45:06.440
and the distance between
us and that source.

00:45:06.440 --> 00:45:09.020
Let's call this d sub l.

00:45:09.020 --> 00:45:12.035
This is a luminosity distance.

00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:22.140
It is a distance that
we measure by inferring

00:45:22.140 --> 00:45:25.350
the behavior of luminosity
of a distant object.

00:45:28.710 --> 00:45:31.330
Now it turns out, and this is a
subject for a different class,

00:45:31.330 --> 00:45:33.540
but nature actually
gives us some objects

00:45:33.540 --> 00:45:38.820
whose luminosity is known or
at least can be calibrated.

00:45:38.820 --> 00:45:43.590
In the case of much of what
is done in cosmology today,

00:45:43.590 --> 00:45:47.430
we can take advantage of the
behavior of certain stars

00:45:47.430 --> 00:45:52.520
whose luminosity is strongly
correlated to the way that--

00:45:52.520 --> 00:45:54.870
these are stars whose
luminosity is variable,

00:45:54.870 --> 00:45:57.585
and we can use the fact that
their variability is correlated

00:45:57.585 --> 00:46:02.310
to their luminosity to infer
what their absolute luminosity

00:46:02.310 --> 00:46:03.720
actually is.

00:46:03.720 --> 00:46:06.690
There are other supernova
events whose luminosity

00:46:06.690 --> 00:46:09.830
likewise appears to
follow a universal law.

00:46:09.830 --> 00:46:14.310
It's related to the
fact that the properties

00:46:14.310 --> 00:46:16.740
of those explosions are
actually set by the microphysics

00:46:16.740 --> 00:46:18.750
of the stars that set them.

00:46:18.750 --> 00:46:22.920
More recently, we've been
able to exploit the fact

00:46:22.920 --> 00:46:27.570
that gravitational wave sources
have an intrinsic luminosity

00:46:27.570 --> 00:46:29.953
in gravitational waves,
the dedt associated

00:46:29.953 --> 00:46:32.220
with the gravitational
waves that they emit,

00:46:32.220 --> 00:46:35.400
which depends on the source
gravitational physics in a very

00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:37.650
simple and predictable
way that doesn't

00:46:37.650 --> 00:46:39.522
depend on very many parameters.

00:46:39.522 --> 00:46:40.980
I actually did a
little bit of work

00:46:40.980 --> 00:46:43.830
on that over the
course of my career,

00:46:43.830 --> 00:46:46.170
and it's a very
exciting development

00:46:46.170 --> 00:46:48.300
that we can now use
these as a way of setting

00:46:48.300 --> 00:46:51.170
the intrinsic luminosity
of certain sources.

00:46:51.170 --> 00:46:54.630
At any rate, if you can take
advantage of these objects that

00:46:54.630 --> 00:46:56.880
have a known luminosity
and you can then

00:46:56.880 --> 00:46:59.160
measure the flux of
radiation in your detector

00:46:59.160 --> 00:47:02.910
from these things, you
have learned the distance.

00:47:02.910 --> 00:47:05.483
At least you have learned
this particular measure

00:47:05.483 --> 00:47:06.150
of the distance.

00:47:13.348 --> 00:47:14.140
That's measure one.

00:47:26.990 --> 00:47:32.270
Measure two is imagine
you have some object

00:47:32.270 --> 00:47:37.100
in the sky that has a particular
intrinsic size associated

00:47:37.100 --> 00:47:38.955
with it.

00:47:38.955 --> 00:47:41.330
You can sort of think of the
objects whose luminosity you

00:47:41.330 --> 00:47:43.910
know about as standard candles.

00:47:43.910 --> 00:47:46.550
Imagine if nature builds
standard yardsticks,

00:47:46.550 --> 00:47:49.220
there's some object whose
size you always know.

00:47:52.670 --> 00:47:59.750
Well, let's compare that
physical size to the angular

00:47:59.750 --> 00:48:00.800
size that you measure.

00:48:08.240 --> 00:48:21.680
The angle that the object
sub tends in the sky

00:48:21.680 --> 00:48:31.410
is going to be that intrinsic
size, delta l divided

00:48:31.410 --> 00:48:33.190
by the distance.

00:48:33.190 --> 00:48:37.720
We'll call this distance d sub
a, for the angular diameter

00:48:37.720 --> 00:48:38.220
distance.

00:48:57.032 --> 00:48:58.490
Believe it or not,
nature, in fact,

00:48:58.490 --> 00:49:00.860
provides standard
yardsticks type

00:49:00.860 --> 00:49:02.360
so that we can actually do this.

00:49:05.070 --> 00:49:06.900
Finally, at least as
a matter of principle,

00:49:06.900 --> 00:49:08.370
imagine you had
some object that's

00:49:08.370 --> 00:49:11.670
moving across the sky with
a speed that you know.

00:49:11.670 --> 00:49:22.150
You could compare
that transverse speed

00:49:22.150 --> 00:49:24.700
to an apparent angular speed.

00:49:37.610 --> 00:49:39.490
So the theta dot,
the angular speed

00:49:39.490 --> 00:50:02.130
that you measure, that
would be the velocity

00:50:02.130 --> 00:50:10.520
perpendicular to your line
of sight divided by distance.

00:50:10.520 --> 00:50:17.720
We'll call this d sub m,
the proper motion distance.

00:50:30.720 --> 00:50:32.330
So if our universe
were Euclidean,

00:50:32.330 --> 00:50:34.635
not only would it be easy
for us to use these three

00:50:34.635 --> 00:50:36.260
measures of distance,
all three of them

00:50:36.260 --> 00:50:41.807
would give the same
result. Because this is all

00:50:41.807 --> 00:50:42.390
just geometry.

00:50:50.370 --> 00:50:54.370
Turns out when you study
these notions of distance,

00:50:54.370 --> 00:51:00.250
in an FRW spacetime, there's
some variation that enters.

00:51:00.250 --> 00:51:06.740
Let me just emphasize here that
there is an excellent summary

00:51:06.740 --> 00:51:07.590
on this stuff.

00:51:07.590 --> 00:51:09.320
I can't remember if I linked
this to the course website

00:51:09.320 --> 00:51:09.820
or not.

00:51:09.820 --> 00:51:10.820
I should and I shall.

00:51:14.300 --> 00:51:16.910
An excellent
summary of all this,

00:51:16.910 --> 00:51:22.010
really emphasizing
observationally significant

00:51:22.010 --> 00:51:26.240
aspects of these things
come from the article that

00:51:26.240 --> 00:51:43.620
is on the archive called
Distance Measures in Cosmology

00:51:43.620 --> 00:51:49.996
by David Hogg, a colleague
at New York University.

00:51:55.460 --> 00:52:02.660
You can find this on the
Astro PH archive, 9905116.

00:52:02.660 --> 00:52:06.010
It's hard for me to believe
this is almost 21 years old now.

00:52:06.010 --> 00:52:07.835
This is a gem of a paper.

00:52:07.835 --> 00:52:09.460
Hogg never submitted
it to any journal,

00:52:09.460 --> 00:52:11.250
just posted it on the
archive so that the community

00:52:11.250 --> 00:52:12.375
could take advantage of it.

00:52:16.700 --> 00:52:21.370
So the textbook by Carroll goes
through the calculation of d

00:52:21.370 --> 00:52:24.270
sub l.

00:52:24.270 --> 00:52:27.480
On a problem set
you will do d sub m.

00:52:27.480 --> 00:52:29.490
We're going to go
through d sub a,

00:52:29.490 --> 00:52:32.490
just so you can see some
of the way that this works.

00:52:32.490 --> 00:52:42.890
Let me emphasize one thing,
all of these measures

00:52:42.890 --> 00:52:44.440
use the first
Friedmann equation.

00:52:57.860 --> 00:53:00.830
So writing your Friedmann
equation like so.

00:53:00.830 --> 00:53:03.830
i is a sum of all
the different species

00:53:03.830 --> 00:53:07.010
of things that can contribute
including curvature.

00:53:07.010 --> 00:53:09.500
So recall that even though
curvature isn't really

00:53:09.500 --> 00:53:13.010
a density, you can
combine enough factors

00:53:13.010 --> 00:53:15.170
to make it act as though
it were a density.

00:53:19.600 --> 00:53:21.692
You assume a power law.

00:53:31.340 --> 00:53:34.390
So this n sub i is related to
the equation of state parameter

00:53:34.390 --> 00:53:36.023
for each one of these species.

00:53:36.023 --> 00:53:37.690
And let's now take
advantage of the fact

00:53:37.690 --> 00:53:42.070
that we know the scale factor
directly ties to redshift.

00:53:42.070 --> 00:53:44.500
I can rewrite this as
how the density evolves

00:53:44.500 --> 00:53:46.960
as a function of redshift.

00:53:46.960 --> 00:53:49.540
So when you put all
of this together,

00:53:49.540 --> 00:53:56.635
this allows us to
write h of a as h of z.

00:54:02.260 --> 00:54:04.840
This is given by the
Hubble parameter now

00:54:04.840 --> 00:54:06.650
times some function e of z.

00:54:23.280 --> 00:54:24.650
And that is simply--

00:54:24.650 --> 00:54:26.680
you divide everything
out to normalize

00:54:26.680 --> 00:54:28.660
to the critical
density, and that

00:54:28.660 --> 00:54:34.410
is a sum over all these
densities with the redshift

00:54:34.410 --> 00:54:35.160
waiting like so.

00:54:42.120 --> 00:54:43.810
Let's really do an
example, like I said.

00:54:43.810 --> 00:54:48.190
So if you read Carroll, you
will see the calculation

00:54:48.190 --> 00:54:49.840
of the luminosity distance.

00:54:49.840 --> 00:54:53.585
If you do the cosmology
problem set that will be--

00:54:53.585 --> 00:54:59.420
I believe its p set 8, you
will explore the proper motion

00:54:59.420 --> 00:54:59.920
distance.

00:55:02.580 --> 00:55:05.950
So let's do the angular
diameter distance.

00:55:05.950 --> 00:55:07.700
Seeing someone work
through this, I think,

00:55:07.700 --> 00:55:10.070
is probably useful for
helping to solidify

00:55:10.070 --> 00:55:12.530
the way in which these
distance measures work

00:55:12.530 --> 00:55:20.430
and how it is that one can tie
together important observables.

00:55:20.430 --> 00:55:24.740
So let's consider
some source that we

00:55:24.740 --> 00:55:31.400
observe that, according to us,
subtends an angle, delta phi.

00:55:47.110 --> 00:55:50.670
Every spacial sector is
spherically symmetric,

00:55:50.670 --> 00:55:53.140
and so we can orient
our coordinate system

00:55:53.140 --> 00:55:56.080
so that this thing, it would
be sort of a standard ruler--

00:55:56.080 --> 00:55:58.690
what we're going to do is
orient our coordinate system

00:55:58.690 --> 00:56:02.940
so that object lies in the
theta equals pi over 2 plane.

00:56:23.820 --> 00:56:26.610
The proper size of that source--

00:56:26.610 --> 00:56:28.793
so the thing is just
sitting in the sky there--

00:56:28.793 --> 00:56:30.210
the proper size
of the source, you

00:56:30.210 --> 00:56:31.585
can get this in
the line element.

00:56:39.250 --> 00:56:42.140
The delta l of
the source will be

00:56:42.140 --> 00:56:46.820
the scale factor at the time
at which it is emitted, r0.

00:56:56.350 --> 00:57:00.310
So this is using one of the
forms of the FRW line elements

00:57:00.310 --> 00:57:04.050
I wrote down at the
beginning of this lecture.

00:57:04.050 --> 00:57:08.924
And so the angular
diameter distance,

00:57:08.924 --> 00:57:11.780
that's a quantity that
I've defined over here,

00:57:11.780 --> 00:57:17.910
it's just the ratio of
this length to that angle.

00:57:31.617 --> 00:57:33.200
Let's rewrite this
using the redshift.

00:57:33.200 --> 00:57:47.075
Redshift is something that
I actually directly observe,

00:57:47.075 --> 00:57:47.700
so there we go.

00:57:52.190 --> 00:57:57.350
This is not wrong,
but it's flawed.

00:57:57.350 --> 00:57:58.220
So this is true.

00:57:58.220 --> 00:57:59.250
This is absolutely true.

00:57:59.250 --> 00:58:02.360
Here's the problem, I don't
know the overall scale

00:58:02.360 --> 00:58:08.570
of my universe and this
coordinate chi doesn't really

00:58:08.570 --> 00:58:10.580
have an observable
meaning to it.

00:58:10.580 --> 00:58:14.300
It's how I label events, but I
look at some quasar in the sky

00:58:14.300 --> 00:58:17.540
and I'm like, what's your chi?

00:58:17.540 --> 00:58:23.660
So what we need to do is
reformulate the numerator

00:58:23.660 --> 00:58:27.050
of this expression in such a
way as to get rid of that chi

00:58:27.050 --> 00:58:29.180
and then see what happens,
see if we have a way

00:58:29.180 --> 00:58:30.458
to get rid of that r0.

00:58:30.458 --> 00:58:31.625
Let's worry about chi first.

00:58:39.210 --> 00:58:42.720
We're going to eliminate it by
taking advantage of the fact

00:58:42.720 --> 00:58:45.480
that the radiation
I am measuring

00:58:45.480 --> 00:58:46.995
comes to me on a null path.

00:59:01.150 --> 00:59:02.150
Not just any null path.

00:59:02.150 --> 00:59:04.210
I'm going imagine
it's a radial one.

00:59:04.210 --> 00:59:08.170
We are allowed to be somewhat
self-centered in defining

00:59:08.170 --> 00:59:10.810
FRW cosmology, we put
ourselves at the origin.

00:59:10.810 --> 00:59:13.510
So any light that
reaches us moves

00:59:13.510 --> 00:59:16.480
on a purely radial trajectory
from its source to us.

00:59:22.780 --> 00:59:32.380
So looking at how the time
and the radial coordinate chi

00:59:32.380 --> 00:59:40.105
are related for a radial null
path we go into our FRW metric.

00:59:51.530 --> 00:59:54.500
I get this.

00:59:54.500 --> 00:59:58.490
So I can integrate this up
to figure out what chi is.

01:00:13.090 --> 01:00:13.805
So this is right.

01:00:13.805 --> 01:00:15.430
Let's massage it a
little bit to put it

01:00:15.430 --> 01:00:17.710
in a form that's a little
bit more useful to us.

01:00:17.710 --> 01:00:19.870
Let's change our variable--

01:00:19.870 --> 01:00:22.390
change our variable of
integration from time to a.

01:00:27.010 --> 01:00:31.810
So this will be an integral
from the scale factor at which

01:00:31.810 --> 01:00:36.040
the radiation is emitted
to the scale factor

01:00:36.040 --> 01:00:38.180
which we observe it, i.e. now.

01:00:38.180 --> 01:00:43.420
And when you do that
change of variables

01:00:43.420 --> 01:00:46.590
your integral changes like so.

01:00:46.590 --> 01:00:53.513
Let's rewrite this once more
to insert my Hubble parameter.

01:01:29.995 --> 01:01:32.140
Now let's change
variables once more.

01:01:32.140 --> 01:01:35.080
We're going to use the fact
that our direct measurable is

01:01:35.080 --> 01:01:36.460
redshift.

01:01:36.460 --> 01:01:45.532
And so if we use a
equals 1 over 1 plus z,

01:01:45.532 --> 01:02:01.636
I can further write this as an
integral over redshift like so.

01:02:01.636 --> 01:02:03.630
And that h0 can come
out of my integral.

01:02:12.070 --> 01:02:15.360
So this is in a form that
is now finally formulated

01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:19.740
in terms of an
observable redshift

01:02:19.740 --> 01:02:22.470
and my model
dependent parameters.

01:02:22.470 --> 01:02:26.460
The various omegas that, when
I construct my universe model,

01:02:26.460 --> 01:02:27.570
I am free to set.

01:02:27.570 --> 01:02:30.035
Or if I am a
phenomenologist, that

01:02:30.035 --> 01:02:31.410
are going to be
knobs that I turn

01:02:31.410 --> 01:02:34.860
to try to design a model
universe that matches

01:02:34.860 --> 01:02:38.760
the data that I am measuring.

01:02:38.760 --> 01:02:41.800
r0, though, is still
kind of annoying.

01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:44.820
We don't know what
this guy is, so what

01:02:44.820 --> 01:03:00.490
we do is eliminate r0 in
favor of a curvature density

01:03:00.490 --> 01:03:01.336
parameter.

01:03:07.660 --> 01:03:10.590
So using the fact
that omega curvature--

01:03:15.400 --> 01:03:17.950
go back to how this was
originally defined--

01:03:17.950 --> 01:03:22.570
it was negative kappa
over h0 squared.

01:03:22.570 --> 01:03:26.590
That's negative k over
r0 squared h0 squared.

01:03:30.700 --> 01:03:39.650
That tells me that r0 is
the Hubble constant now,

01:03:39.650 --> 01:03:44.660
divided by the square
root of the absolute value

01:03:44.660 --> 01:03:50.550
of the curvature, at least
if k equals plus or minus 1.

01:03:50.550 --> 01:03:53.460
What happens when it's not plus
or minus 1, if it's equal to 0?

01:03:53.460 --> 01:03:54.460
Well, hold that thought.

01:04:11.720 --> 01:04:13.400
So let's put all
these pieces together.

01:04:35.720 --> 01:04:37.220
So assembling all
the ingredients

01:04:37.220 --> 01:04:43.180
I have here, what we find is
the angular diameter distance.

01:04:43.180 --> 01:04:47.570
There's a factor
of 1 over 1 plus z,

01:04:47.570 --> 01:04:49.280
1 over the Hubble constant.

01:04:49.280 --> 01:04:53.670
Remember, Hubble has
units of 1 over length--

01:04:53.670 --> 01:04:56.215
excuse me, 1 over time,
and with the factor

01:04:56.215 --> 01:04:57.590
of the speed of
light that is a 1

01:04:57.590 --> 01:05:01.130
over length, so one over
the Hubble parameter now

01:05:01.130 --> 01:05:03.380
is essentially a kind of
fiducial overall distance

01:05:03.380 --> 01:05:04.800
scale.

01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:13.040
And then our solution breaks
up into three branches,

01:05:13.040 --> 01:05:18.140
depending upon whether k
equals minus 1, 0, or 1.

01:05:20.710 --> 01:05:26.460
So you get one term where it
involves minus square root

01:05:26.460 --> 01:05:32.025
the absolute value of the
curvature parameter times sine.

01:05:35.980 --> 01:05:38.620
That same absolute value of
the curvature parameters square

01:05:38.620 --> 01:05:39.120
root.

01:05:55.780 --> 01:05:59.220
So here's your k
equals plus 1 branch.

01:05:59.220 --> 01:06:02.800
For your k equals 0
branch, basically what

01:06:02.800 --> 01:06:07.300
you'll find when you
plug-in your s of k

01:06:07.300 --> 01:06:09.400
is that r0 cancels out.

01:06:12.460 --> 01:06:15.100
So that ends up
being a parameter

01:06:15.100 --> 01:06:17.920
you do not need to worry
about, and I suggest you just

01:06:17.920 --> 01:06:19.450
work through the
algebra and you'll

01:06:19.450 --> 01:06:28.450
find that for k equals 0,
it simply looks like this.

01:06:31.980 --> 01:06:36.659
And then finally, if you
are in an open universe--

01:06:46.450 --> 01:06:48.135
that is supposed
to be curvature--

01:07:11.430 --> 01:07:12.480
what we get is this.

01:07:22.003 --> 01:07:23.420
So this is a
distance measure that

01:07:23.420 --> 01:07:27.740
tells me how angular
diameter distance depends

01:07:27.740 --> 01:07:29.540
on observable parameters.

01:07:29.540 --> 01:07:31.520
Hubble is something
that we can measure.

01:07:31.520 --> 01:07:33.830
Redshift is something
we can measure.

01:07:33.830 --> 01:07:36.840
And it depends on
model parameters,

01:07:36.840 --> 01:07:40.317
the different densities
that go into e of z, and--

01:07:40.317 --> 01:07:41.900
which I have on the
board right here--

01:07:44.940 --> 01:07:47.000
the different densities
that go into e of z.

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.880
My apologies, I left
out that h0 there--

01:07:49.880 --> 01:07:55.170
and your choice
of the curvature.

01:07:55.170 --> 01:07:59.660
When you analyze
these three distances

01:07:59.660 --> 01:08:00.765
here is what you find.

01:08:21.910 --> 01:08:25.770
You find that the
luminosity distance

01:08:25.770 --> 01:08:29.990
is related to the proper motion
distance by a factor of 1

01:08:29.990 --> 01:08:36.210
plus z, and that's related to
the angular diameter distance

01:08:36.210 --> 01:08:38.439
by a factor of 1 plus z squared.

01:08:38.439 --> 01:08:42.000
So when you read Carroll, you
will find that 1 plus z factor

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:43.260
there--

01:08:43.260 --> 01:08:47.637
excuse me, 1 plus z to the minus
1 power turns into a 1 plus z--

01:08:47.637 --> 01:08:48.970
is the camera not looking at me?

01:08:48.970 --> 01:08:49.470
Hello?

01:08:49.470 --> 01:08:50.279
There we go.

01:08:50.279 --> 01:08:56.955
So that 1 over 1 plus z
turns into a 1 plus z.

01:08:56.955 --> 01:08:59.580
When you do it on the p set, you
do the proper motion distance,

01:08:59.580 --> 01:09:03.359
so it will just be no 1 plus z
factor in front of everything.

01:09:03.359 --> 01:09:07.290
So the name of the game
when one is doing cosmology

01:09:07.290 --> 01:09:11.910
as a physicist is
to find quantities

01:09:11.910 --> 01:09:14.729
that you can measure that
allow you to determine

01:09:14.729 --> 01:09:18.479
luminosity distances,
angular diameter distances,

01:09:18.479 --> 01:09:20.189
proper motion distances.

01:09:20.189 --> 01:09:23.220
Now it turns out that the
proper motion distance

01:09:23.220 --> 01:09:26.880
is not a very practical
one for basically

01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:29.310
any cosmologically
interesting source.

01:09:29.310 --> 01:09:33.270
They are simply so far
away that even for a source

01:09:33.270 --> 01:09:35.910
moving essentially at
the speed of light,

01:09:35.910 --> 01:09:37.710
the amount of
angular motion that

01:09:37.710 --> 01:09:42.819
can be seen over essentially a
human lifetime is negligible.

01:09:42.819 --> 01:09:46.000
So this turns into
something that--

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:46.632
hi.

01:09:46.632 --> 01:09:47.590
MIT POLICE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:09:47.590 --> 01:09:48.060
SCOTT HUGHES: That's OK.

01:09:48.060 --> 01:09:50.194
Yeah, I'm doing some
pre-recording of lectures.

01:09:50.194 --> 01:09:53.133
[LAUGHS] I was warned
you guys might come by.

01:09:53.133 --> 01:09:55.050
I have my ID with me and
things like that, so.

01:09:55.050 --> 01:09:55.515
MIT POLICE: That's fine.

01:09:55.515 --> 01:09:55.980
Take care.

01:09:55.980 --> 01:09:57.230
MIT POLICE: You look official.

01:09:57.230 --> 01:09:59.132
SCOTT HUGHES: [LAUGHS]
I appreciate it.

01:09:59.132 --> 01:10:01.590
So those of you watching the
video at home, as you can see,

01:10:01.590 --> 01:10:03.270
the MIT police is
keeping us safe.

01:10:06.360 --> 01:10:08.040
Scared the crap out
of me for a second

01:10:08.040 --> 01:10:10.090
there, but it's all good.

01:10:10.090 --> 01:10:12.390
All right, so let's go
back to this for a second.

01:10:12.390 --> 01:10:15.372
So the proper motion
distance is something

01:10:15.372 --> 01:10:16.830
that is not
particularly practical,

01:10:16.830 --> 01:10:19.330
because as I said, even if you
have an object that is moving

01:10:19.330 --> 01:10:24.450
close to the speed of
light this is not something

01:10:24.450 --> 01:10:26.790
that even over the course
of a human lifetime

01:10:26.790 --> 01:10:30.550
you are likely to see
significant angular motion.

01:10:30.550 --> 01:10:32.160
So this is generally not used.

01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:35.160
But luminosity distances and
angular diameter distances,

01:10:35.160 --> 01:10:38.340
that is, in fact,
extremely important,

01:10:38.340 --> 01:10:45.990
and a lot of cosmology is based
on looking for well understood

01:10:45.990 --> 01:10:49.440
objects where we can
calibrate the physical size

01:10:49.440 --> 01:10:51.330
and infer the angular
diameter distance,

01:10:51.330 --> 01:10:53.820
or we know the
intrinsic brightness

01:10:53.820 --> 01:10:56.700
and we can determine
the luminosity distance.

01:10:56.700 --> 01:10:59.670
So let me just give
a quick snapshot

01:10:59.670 --> 01:11:02.580
of where the measurements come
from in modern cosmology that

01:11:02.580 --> 01:11:04.650
are driving our
cosmological model.

01:11:17.470 --> 01:11:20.498
One of the most important is
the cosmic microwave background.

01:11:28.630 --> 01:11:32.130
So, vastly oversimplifying, when
we look at the cosmic microwave

01:11:32.130 --> 01:11:38.910
background after removing
things like the flow

01:11:38.910 --> 01:11:43.490
of our solar system with respect
to the rest frame of-- excuse

01:11:43.490 --> 01:11:45.000
me, the co-moving
reference frame

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:46.710
of the cause of the
fluid that makes up

01:11:46.710 --> 01:11:51.240
our universe, the size
of hot and cold spots

01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:52.140
is a standard ruler.

01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:08.970
By looking at the
distribution of sizes

01:12:08.970 --> 01:12:11.040
that we see from
these things, we

01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:14.003
can determine the
angular diameter distance

01:12:14.003 --> 01:12:15.420
to the cosmic
microwave background

01:12:15.420 --> 01:12:17.130
with very high precision.

01:12:17.130 --> 01:12:20.310
This ends up being one of the
most important constraints

01:12:20.310 --> 01:12:23.070
on determining what the
curvature parameter actually

01:12:23.070 --> 01:12:24.450
is.

01:12:24.450 --> 01:12:27.300
And it is largely thanks to
the cosmic microwave background

01:12:27.300 --> 01:12:33.500
that current prejudice, I would
say, the current best wisdom--

01:12:33.500 --> 01:12:36.800
choose your descriptor
as you wish--

01:12:36.800 --> 01:12:39.080
is that k equals
0 and our universe

01:12:39.080 --> 01:12:40.340
is in fact spatially flat.

01:12:43.370 --> 01:12:48.453
Second one is what are
called type 1a supernova.

01:12:57.330 --> 01:13:03.150
These are essentially the
thermonuclear detonations

01:13:03.150 --> 01:13:04.140
of white dwarfs.

01:13:11.320 --> 01:13:13.070
Not even really
thermonuclear, it's just--

01:13:17.725 --> 01:13:19.600
my apologies, I'm
confusing a different event

01:13:19.600 --> 01:13:21.275
that involves white dwarfs.

01:13:21.275 --> 01:13:22.900
The type 1a's are
not the thermonuclear

01:13:22.900 --> 01:13:24.025
explosions of these things.

01:13:24.025 --> 01:13:26.900
This is actually the core
collapse of a white dwarf star.

01:13:26.900 --> 01:13:30.610
So this is what happens when
a white dwarf it creates

01:13:30.610 --> 01:13:33.220
or in some way
accumulates enough mass

01:13:33.220 --> 01:13:37.300
such that electron
degeneracy pressure is

01:13:37.300 --> 01:13:40.780
no longer sufficient to hold it
against gravitational collapse,

01:13:40.780 --> 01:13:45.790
and the whole thing basically
collapses into a neutron star.

01:13:45.790 --> 01:13:49.270
That happens at a defined
mass, the Chandrasekhar mass,

01:13:49.270 --> 01:13:52.180
named after one of my
scientific heroes, Subramanian

01:13:52.180 --> 01:13:54.910
Chandrasekhar.

01:13:54.910 --> 01:13:59.830
And because it has a defined
mass associated with it,

01:13:59.830 --> 01:14:01.600
every event basically
has the same amount

01:14:01.600 --> 01:14:03.040
of matter participating.

01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:04.810
This is a standard candle.

01:14:22.035 --> 01:14:23.660
So there's a couple
others that I'm not

01:14:23.660 --> 01:14:26.150
going to talk about in
too much detail here.

01:14:26.150 --> 01:14:28.500
While I'm erasing the board
I will just mention them.

01:14:28.500 --> 01:14:32.150
So by looking at things like
the clustering of galaxies

01:14:32.150 --> 01:14:38.510
we can measure the
distribution of mass

01:14:38.510 --> 01:14:41.360
in the universe that allows
us to determine the omega m

01:14:41.360 --> 01:14:42.560
parameter.

01:14:42.560 --> 01:14:44.120
That's one of the
bits of information

01:14:44.120 --> 01:14:47.000
that tells us that
much of the universe

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.790
is made of matter that
apparently does not

01:14:49.790 --> 01:14:51.650
participate in standard
model processes

01:14:51.650 --> 01:14:52.890
as we know them today--

01:14:52.890 --> 01:14:55.430
the so-called dark
matter problem.

01:14:55.430 --> 01:14:58.490
We can look at chemical
abundances, which tells us

01:14:58.490 --> 01:15:01.340
about the behavior of
nuclear processes in the very

01:15:01.340 --> 01:15:02.800
early universe.

01:15:02.800 --> 01:15:04.550
And the last one which
I will mention here

01:15:04.550 --> 01:15:10.355
is we can look at
nearby standard candles.

01:15:16.760 --> 01:15:18.890
And nearby standard
candles allow

01:15:18.890 --> 01:15:22.350
us to probe the local
Hubble law and determine h0.

01:15:26.392 --> 01:15:27.600
"Probble," that's not a word.

01:15:30.410 --> 01:15:33.570
If you combine "probe" and
"Hubble" you get "probble."

01:15:40.150 --> 01:15:42.120
And when I say
nearby, that usually

01:15:42.120 --> 01:15:45.157
means events that are merely
a few tens of millions

01:15:45.157 --> 01:15:45.990
of light years away.

01:15:48.720 --> 01:15:53.343
It's worth noting that all
of these various techniques,

01:15:53.343 --> 01:15:55.760
all of these different things,
you can kind of even see it

01:15:55.760 --> 01:15:58.093
when you think about the
mathematical form of everything

01:15:58.093 --> 01:16:00.530
that went into our
distance measures,

01:16:00.530 --> 01:16:02.970
they're all highly
entangled with each other.

01:16:02.970 --> 01:16:05.660
And so to do this kind
of thing properly,

01:16:05.660 --> 01:16:08.000
you need to take just
a crap load of data,

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.580
combine all of your
data sets, and do

01:16:10.580 --> 01:16:14.240
a joint analysis of
everything, looking at the way

01:16:14.240 --> 01:16:17.480
varying the parameters and
all the different models

01:16:17.480 --> 01:16:19.913
affects the outcome
of your observables.

01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:26.510
You also have to carefully
take into account the fact

01:16:26.510 --> 01:16:29.900
that when you measure something,
you measure it with errors.

01:16:29.900 --> 01:16:31.920
And so many of these
things are not known.

01:16:31.920 --> 01:16:33.920
Turns out you can usually
measure redshift quite

01:16:33.920 --> 01:16:36.203
precisely, but these
distances always

01:16:36.203 --> 01:16:38.120
come with some error bar
associated with them.

01:16:38.120 --> 01:16:40.220
And so that means that
the distance you associate

01:16:40.220 --> 01:16:42.170
with a particular
redshift, which

01:16:42.170 --> 01:16:45.048
is equivalent to associating
a time with a redshift,

01:16:45.048 --> 01:16:46.340
there's some error bar on that.

01:16:46.340 --> 01:16:49.610
And that can lead to
significant skew in what you

01:16:49.610 --> 01:16:50.570
determine from things.

01:16:56.090 --> 01:16:58.922
There's a lot more we could
say, but time is finite

01:16:58.922 --> 01:17:00.380
and we need to
change topic, so I'm

01:17:00.380 --> 01:17:05.840
going to conclude this lecture
by talking about two mysteries

01:17:05.840 --> 01:17:08.270
in the cosmological
model that have been

01:17:08.270 --> 01:17:11.780
the focus of a lot
of research attention

01:17:11.780 --> 01:17:15.220
over the past several decades.

01:17:15.220 --> 01:17:15.970
Two mysteries.

01:17:15.970 --> 01:17:20.870
One, why is it that
our universe appears

01:17:20.870 --> 01:17:23.950
to be flat, spatially flat?

01:17:45.220 --> 01:17:47.040
So to frame why this
is a bit of a mystery,

01:17:47.040 --> 01:17:49.510
you did just sort
of go, eh, come on.

01:17:49.510 --> 01:17:52.450
You've got three choices for
the parameter, you got 0.

01:17:58.650 --> 01:18:01.170
Let's begin by thinking about
the first Friedmann equation.

01:18:16.350 --> 01:18:22.790
I can write this
like so, or I can

01:18:22.790 --> 01:18:28.070
use this form, where I say
omega plus omega curvature--

01:18:28.070 --> 01:18:31.220
I'm going to call
that omega c for now--

01:18:31.220 --> 01:18:32.060
that equals 1.

01:18:37.040 --> 01:18:41.750
The expectation had long
been that our universe would

01:18:41.750 --> 01:18:45.230
basically be dominated by
various species of matter

01:18:45.230 --> 01:18:49.020
and radiation for
much of its history,

01:18:49.020 --> 01:18:50.785
especially in the
early universe.

01:19:23.240 --> 01:19:26.430
If it was radiation
dominated, you'd

01:19:26.430 --> 01:19:31.800
expect the density to
go as a to the minus 4.

01:19:35.030 --> 01:19:36.530
If it's matter
dominated, you expect

01:19:36.530 --> 01:19:37.880
it to go as a to the minus 3.

01:19:44.620 --> 01:19:48.280
Now, your curvature density
goes as a to the minus 2.

01:20:22.680 --> 01:20:24.610
And so what this
means is that if you

01:20:24.610 --> 01:20:33.980
look at the ratio of
omega curvature to omega,

01:20:33.980 --> 01:20:41.360
this will be proportional
to a, for matter,

01:20:41.360 --> 01:20:50.180
a squared for radiation.

01:20:50.180 --> 01:20:56.820
If your universe--
in some sense,

01:20:56.820 --> 01:21:00.768
looking at these parameter
k of the minus 1, 0, 1,

01:21:00.768 --> 01:21:02.060
that's a little bit misleading.

01:21:02.060 --> 01:21:03.330
It's probably a little
bit more useful to think

01:21:03.330 --> 01:21:05.430
about things in terms
of the kappa parameter.

01:21:05.430 --> 01:21:08.820
And when you look at
that, your flat universe

01:21:08.820 --> 01:21:13.350
is a set of measure 0 in the
set of all possible curvature

01:21:13.350 --> 01:21:15.330
parameters that you could have.

01:21:15.330 --> 01:21:19.050
And physicists tend
to get suspicious

01:21:19.050 --> 01:21:24.060
when something that
could take on any range

01:21:24.060 --> 01:21:26.340
of possible random values
between minus infinity

01:21:26.340 --> 01:21:29.160
and infinity picks out zero.

01:21:29.160 --> 01:21:30.660
That tends to tell
us that there may

01:21:30.660 --> 01:21:32.970
be some principle at play
that actually derives things

01:21:32.970 --> 01:21:33.630
to being 0.

01:21:36.210 --> 01:21:37.950
Looking at it this
way, imagine you

01:21:37.950 --> 01:21:40.830
have a universe
that at early times

01:21:40.830 --> 01:21:47.160
is very close to being
flat, but not quite.

01:21:51.360 --> 01:22:07.200
Any slight deviation
from flatness

01:22:07.200 --> 01:22:10.620
grows as the universe expands.

01:22:16.990 --> 01:22:19.560
That's mystery one.

01:22:19.560 --> 01:22:30.090
Mystery two, why is the
cosmic microwave background

01:22:30.090 --> 01:22:32.420
so homogeneous?

01:22:35.330 --> 01:22:38.640
So when we look at the
cosmic microwave background,

01:22:38.640 --> 01:22:44.120
we see that it has
the same properties.

01:22:44.120 --> 01:22:45.650
The light has the
same brightness,

01:22:45.650 --> 01:22:47.780
it has the same temperature
associated with it,

01:22:47.780 --> 01:22:50.217
to within in a part in 100,000.

01:22:50.217 --> 01:22:51.800
Now the standard
model of our universe

01:22:51.800 --> 01:22:54.740
tells us that at
very early times

01:22:54.740 --> 01:22:57.020
the universe was essentially
a dense hot plasma.

01:23:18.990 --> 01:23:27.080
This thing cooled as
the universe expanded,

01:23:27.080 --> 01:23:31.070
much the same way that
if you have a bag of gas,

01:23:31.070 --> 01:23:33.650
you squeeze it very
rapidly, it will get hot,

01:23:33.650 --> 01:23:37.520
you stretch it very
rapidly, it will cool.

01:23:42.440 --> 01:23:44.792
There's a few more details
of this in my notes,

01:23:44.792 --> 01:23:46.750
but when we look at this
one the things that we

01:23:46.750 --> 01:23:53.530
see is that in a universe that
is only driven by matter or by

01:23:53.530 --> 01:23:54.330
radiation--

01:24:01.860 --> 01:24:04.670
so the matter dominated and
radiation dominated picture--

01:24:16.510 --> 01:24:31.260
it shows us that points on
opposite sides of the sky

01:24:31.260 --> 01:24:34.320
were actually out of causal
contact with each other

01:24:34.320 --> 01:24:36.195
in the earliest moments
of the universe.

01:24:58.980 --> 01:25:01.800
In other words, I
look at the sky,

01:25:01.800 --> 01:25:07.650
and the patch of sky over
here was out of causal contact

01:25:07.650 --> 01:25:10.530
with the patch of sky
over here in the earliest

01:25:10.530 --> 01:25:12.960
days of the universe.

01:25:12.960 --> 01:25:14.900
And yet they had the
same temperature,

01:25:14.900 --> 01:25:19.490
which suggests that they
were in thermal equilibrium.

01:25:19.490 --> 01:25:23.930
How can two disparate,
unconnected patch of the sky

01:25:23.930 --> 01:25:26.510
have the same temperature
if they cannot exchange

01:25:26.510 --> 01:25:27.620
information?

01:25:30.093 --> 01:25:31.760
You could imagine it
being a coincidence

01:25:31.760 --> 01:25:33.968
if one little bit of the
sky has the same temperature

01:25:33.968 --> 01:25:37.350
as a bit of another
piece, but in fact,

01:25:37.350 --> 01:25:39.950
when you do this calculation,
you find huge patch of the sky

01:25:39.950 --> 01:25:42.690
could not communicate
with any other.

01:25:42.690 --> 01:25:49.550
And so how then is it that the
entire sky that we can observe

01:25:49.550 --> 01:25:52.520
has the same temperature
at the earliest

01:25:52.520 --> 01:25:56.020
times within a part in 100,000.

01:25:56.020 --> 01:25:58.580
You guys will explore this on--

01:25:58.580 --> 01:26:01.930
I believe it's
problem set eight.

01:26:01.930 --> 01:26:21.490
The solution to both of these
problems that has been proposed

01:26:21.490 --> 01:26:23.205
is cosmic inflation.

01:26:30.490 --> 01:26:34.250
So what you do is imagine
that at some earlier

01:26:34.250 --> 01:26:38.420
moment in the
universe, our universe

01:26:38.420 --> 01:26:41.423
was filled with
some strange field,

01:26:41.423 --> 01:26:43.340
and I'll describe the
properties of that field

01:26:43.340 --> 01:26:46.370
in just a moment, such
that it acted like it

01:26:46.370 --> 01:26:47.750
had a cosmological constant.

01:27:15.900 --> 01:27:18.990
In such an epic, the scale
factor of the universe

01:27:18.990 --> 01:27:24.382
goes as exponentially with
the square root of the size

01:27:24.382 --> 01:27:25.590
of the cosmological constant.

01:27:30.140 --> 01:27:33.740
What you find when you look at
this is that this-- it still,

01:27:33.740 --> 01:27:36.410
of course, goes as
a to the minus 2--

01:27:36.410 --> 01:27:37.520
but a to the minus--

01:27:37.520 --> 01:27:38.760
well, sorry.

01:27:38.760 --> 01:27:40.040
Let me back up for a second.

01:27:40.040 --> 01:27:43.370
So my scale factor in
this case you'll find

01:27:43.370 --> 01:27:48.360
goes are a to the
minus 2, and that's

01:27:48.360 --> 01:27:51.030
because the density associated
with the cosmological constant

01:27:51.030 --> 01:27:51.900
remains constant.

01:28:01.860 --> 01:28:03.830
So even if you start
in the early universe

01:28:03.830 --> 01:28:06.150
with some random value
for the curvature,

01:28:06.150 --> 01:28:10.070
if you are in this epic
of exponential inflation,

01:28:10.070 --> 01:28:12.530
just for-- you know, you have
to worry about timescales

01:28:12.530 --> 01:28:14.330
a little bit, but if
you do it long enough

01:28:14.330 --> 01:28:17.630
you can drive this
very, very close to 0.

01:28:17.630 --> 01:28:20.960
So much so that when
you then move forward,

01:28:20.960 --> 01:28:25.250
let's say you come out of this
period of cosmic inflation

01:28:25.250 --> 01:28:28.160
and you enter a universe that
is radiation dominated or matter

01:28:28.160 --> 01:28:31.160
dominated, it will
then begin to grow,

01:28:31.160 --> 01:28:34.800
but if you drive it sufficiently
close to 0 it doesn't matter.

01:28:34.800 --> 01:28:39.170
You're never going to catch up
with what inflation did to you.

01:28:39.170 --> 01:28:42.410
On the P set you will
also show that if you

01:28:42.410 --> 01:28:51.140
have a period of
inflation like this, then

01:28:51.140 --> 01:28:53.630
that also cures the problem
of piece of the sky being

01:28:53.630 --> 01:28:55.170
out of causal contact.

01:28:55.170 --> 01:28:56.870
So when you do
that, what you find

01:28:56.870 --> 01:29:03.470
is that essentially everything
is in causal contact early on.

01:29:03.470 --> 01:29:05.510
It may sort of come
out of causal contact

01:29:05.510 --> 01:29:09.480
after inflation has ended,
more on that in just a moment,

01:29:09.480 --> 01:29:11.660
and then things sort of
change as the universe

01:29:11.660 --> 01:29:12.500
continues to evolve.

01:29:15.320 --> 01:29:20.320
OK so it looks like
recording is back on.

01:29:20.320 --> 01:29:21.783
My apologies, everyone.

01:29:21.783 --> 01:29:23.200
So as I was in the
middle of talk,

01:29:23.200 --> 01:29:26.500
I talked a little bit too long
in this particular lecture

01:29:26.500 --> 01:29:29.260
so we're going to spill
over into a little bit

01:29:29.260 --> 01:29:32.730
of an addendum, just a
five-ish minute piece that

01:29:32.730 --> 01:29:35.500
goes a bit beyond this.

01:29:35.500 --> 01:29:38.260
Doing this by myself is a
little bit weird, I'm tired,

01:29:38.260 --> 01:29:40.060
and I will confess,
I got a little bit

01:29:40.060 --> 01:29:42.745
rattled when the police
came in to check in on me.

01:29:42.745 --> 01:29:43.870
Let's back up for a second.

01:29:43.870 --> 01:29:47.140
So I was talking
about two mysteries

01:29:47.140 --> 01:29:49.600
of the modern
cosmological model.

01:29:49.600 --> 01:29:52.270
One of them is this question
of why the universe is

01:29:52.270 --> 01:29:54.520
so apparently flat.

01:29:54.520 --> 01:29:58.180
The spatial sector of the
universe appears to be flat.

01:29:58.180 --> 01:30:00.055
And we had this expectation
that the universe

01:30:00.055 --> 01:30:05.400
is either radiation dominated
or matter dominated,

01:30:05.400 --> 01:30:09.420
which would give us the density
associated with radiation.

01:30:09.420 --> 01:30:11.462
If it was radiation
dominated, then the density

01:30:11.462 --> 01:30:13.920
of stuff in our universe would
fall off as the scale factor

01:30:13.920 --> 01:30:14.820
to the fourth power.

01:30:14.820 --> 01:30:16.570
If it's matter dominant,
it's scale factor

01:30:16.570 --> 01:30:18.067
to the third power.

01:30:18.067 --> 01:30:20.400
When you define a density
associated with the curvature,

01:30:20.400 --> 01:30:24.550
it falls off as scale
factor to the second power.

01:30:24.550 --> 01:30:28.110
And so if we look at the
ratio of the curvature density

01:30:28.110 --> 01:30:34.440
to any other kind of density, it
grows as the universe expands.

01:30:34.440 --> 01:30:37.530
So any slight deviation
from flatness we

01:30:37.530 --> 01:30:39.300
would expect to grow.

01:30:39.300 --> 01:30:41.430
And that's just confusing.

01:30:41.430 --> 01:30:44.430
Why is it when we make the
various measurements that we

01:30:44.430 --> 01:30:46.912
have been making for the
past several decades,

01:30:46.912 --> 01:30:48.870
all the evidence is
pointing to a universe that

01:30:48.870 --> 01:30:52.590
has a flatness of 0?

01:30:52.590 --> 01:30:55.980
If you sort of imagine that
the parameter kappa can

01:30:55.980 --> 01:30:58.360
be any number between
minus infinity to infinity,

01:30:58.360 --> 01:31:00.760
why is nature picking out 0?

01:31:00.760 --> 01:31:04.000
Another mystery is why is the
cosmic microwave background

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:05.880
so homogeneous?

01:31:05.880 --> 01:31:08.460
We believe that the universe
was a very hot dense plasma

01:31:08.460 --> 01:31:09.660
at very early times.

01:31:09.660 --> 01:31:14.570
It cooled as the
universe expanded,

01:31:14.570 --> 01:31:21.740
and when we measured the
radiation from that cooling

01:31:21.740 --> 01:31:23.570
expanding ball of
plasma, what we find

01:31:23.570 --> 01:31:25.070
is that it has the
same temperature

01:31:25.070 --> 01:31:28.520
at every point in the sky
to within a part in 100,000.

01:31:28.520 --> 01:31:34.580
But when one looks at the
behavior of how light moves

01:31:34.580 --> 01:31:37.760
around in the early universe,
if the universe is matter

01:31:37.760 --> 01:31:39.740
dominated or
radiation dominated,

01:31:39.740 --> 01:31:43.280
what you find is that a piece
of the sky over here cannot

01:31:43.280 --> 01:31:45.650
communicate with a
piece of sky over here.

01:31:45.650 --> 01:31:46.850
Or over here, or over here.

01:31:46.850 --> 01:31:50.480
You actually find that
the size of the sky

01:31:50.480 --> 01:31:52.400
that, if I look at
a piece of sky over

01:31:52.400 --> 01:31:54.500
here, how much of the
universe could it talk to,

01:31:54.500 --> 01:31:56.220
it's surprisingly small.

01:31:56.220 --> 01:31:58.970
So how is it that
the entire universe

01:31:58.970 --> 01:32:00.110
has the same temperature?

01:32:00.110 --> 01:32:03.590
How is that they are apparently
in thermal equilibrium,

01:32:03.590 --> 01:32:08.260
even if they cannot
exchange information?

01:32:08.260 --> 01:32:11.380
So I spent some while
talking to myself

01:32:11.380 --> 01:32:13.710
after the cameras went out.

01:32:13.710 --> 01:32:16.420
So I'll just sketch
what I wrote down.

01:32:16.420 --> 01:32:19.270
A proposed solution to this,
to both of these mysteries,

01:32:19.270 --> 01:32:21.310
is what is known as cosmic
inflation, something

01:32:21.310 --> 01:32:24.790
that our own Alan Guth shares
a lot of the credit for helping

01:32:24.790 --> 01:32:25.930
to develop.

01:32:25.930 --> 01:32:31.130
So recall, if we have a
cosmological constant,

01:32:31.130 --> 01:32:33.730
then the scale factor
grows exponentially

01:32:33.730 --> 01:32:35.695
and the density of
stuff associated

01:32:35.695 --> 01:32:39.190
with that cosmological
constant is constant.

01:32:39.190 --> 01:32:42.540
As the universe expands,
the energy density

01:32:42.540 --> 01:32:44.290
associated with that
cosmological constant

01:32:44.290 --> 01:32:46.060
does not change.

01:32:46.060 --> 01:32:49.100
If our universe is dominated
by such a constant,

01:32:49.100 --> 01:32:52.390
then the ratio of density is
associated with curvature,

01:32:52.390 --> 01:32:54.970
the density associated with
cosmological constant, actually

01:32:54.970 --> 01:32:59.080
falls off inversely with
the curvature scale squared,

01:32:59.080 --> 01:33:01.450
and the curvature scale
is growing exponentially,

01:33:01.450 --> 01:33:03.970
it means that omega
c is being driven

01:33:03.970 --> 01:33:11.410
to zero relative to the density
in cosmological constant, as e

01:33:11.410 --> 01:33:12.390
to a factor like this.

01:33:12.390 --> 01:33:14.713
It's being exponentially
driven close to 0.

01:33:14.713 --> 01:33:16.630
You'd do do a little bit
of work to figure out

01:33:16.630 --> 01:33:18.505
what the timescales
associated with this are,

01:33:18.505 --> 01:33:21.280
but this suggests that if you
can put the universe in a state

01:33:21.280 --> 01:33:23.590
where it looks like a
cosmological constant,

01:33:23.590 --> 01:33:28.090
you can drive the density
associated with curvature as

01:33:28.090 --> 01:33:29.570
close to 0 as you want.

01:33:35.350 --> 01:33:38.420
Recall that a cosmological
constant is actually

01:33:38.420 --> 01:33:41.300
equivalent to there
being a vacuum energy.

01:33:41.300 --> 01:33:43.640
If we think about the
universe being filled

01:33:43.640 --> 01:33:46.940
with some kind of a scalar
field at early times,

01:33:46.940 --> 01:33:51.410
it can play the role of
such a vacuum energy.

01:33:51.410 --> 01:33:53.000
Without going into
the details, one

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.070
finds that in an
expanding universe

01:33:55.070 --> 01:33:58.080
there is an equation of
motion for that scalar field.

01:33:58.080 --> 01:34:01.520
How the field itself behaves
is driven by a differential

01:34:01.520 --> 01:34:02.710
equation, looks like this.

01:34:02.710 --> 01:34:04.293
Here's your Hubble
parameters, so this

01:34:04.293 --> 01:34:06.650
has to do with a
scale factor in here.

01:34:06.650 --> 01:34:09.590
v is a potential for this
scalar field, which I'm not

01:34:09.590 --> 01:34:11.630
going to say too much about.

01:34:11.630 --> 01:34:13.885
Take this guy, couple it to
your Friedmann equations,

01:34:13.885 --> 01:34:15.260
and the one that's
most important

01:34:15.260 --> 01:34:16.630
is the first Friedmann equation.

01:34:16.630 --> 01:34:19.700
What you see is that v of
phi is playing the role

01:34:19.700 --> 01:34:22.310
of a cosmological constant.

01:34:22.310 --> 01:34:24.610
It's playing the
role of a density.

01:34:24.610 --> 01:34:27.860
So if we can put the
universe into a state where

01:34:27.860 --> 01:34:31.190
it is in fact being dominated
by this scalar field,

01:34:31.190 --> 01:34:33.290
by the potential associated
with the scalar field,

01:34:33.290 --> 01:34:35.660
it will inflate.

01:34:35.660 --> 01:34:38.540
A lot of the research in
early universe physics

01:34:38.540 --> 01:34:40.490
that has gone on over
the past couple decades

01:34:40.490 --> 01:34:43.670
has gone into understanding what
are the consequences of such a

01:34:43.670 --> 01:34:45.080
such a potential.

01:34:45.080 --> 01:34:46.480
Can we make such a potential?

01:34:46.480 --> 01:34:49.460
Do the laws of physics permit
something like this to exist?

01:34:49.460 --> 01:34:53.030
If the universe is in this
state early on, what changed?

01:34:53.030 --> 01:34:54.745
How is it that
this thing evolves?

01:34:54.745 --> 01:34:56.120
Is there is an
equation of motion

01:34:56.120 --> 01:34:57.745
here so that scalar
field is presumably

01:34:57.745 --> 01:34:59.480
evolving in some kind of a way?

01:34:59.480 --> 01:35:01.163
Is there a potential,
does nature

01:35:01.163 --> 01:35:03.830
permit us to have a field of the
sort with a potential that sort

01:35:03.830 --> 01:35:05.720
of goes away after some time?

01:35:05.720 --> 01:35:09.440
Once it goes away, what
happens to that field?

01:35:09.440 --> 01:35:12.450
Is there any smoking gun
associated with this?

01:35:12.450 --> 01:35:14.990
If we look at the
universe and this

01:35:14.990 --> 01:35:20.240
is a plausible explanation
for why the universe appears

01:35:20.240 --> 01:35:22.700
to be spatially flat and
why the cosmic microwave

01:35:22.700 --> 01:35:25.303
background is so homogeneous.

01:35:25.303 --> 01:35:26.720
Is there anything
else that we can

01:35:26.720 --> 01:35:30.020
look at that would basically say
yes, the universe did in fact

01:35:30.020 --> 01:35:32.720
have this kind of an expansion?

01:35:32.720 --> 01:35:34.430
Without getting into
the weeds too much,

01:35:34.430 --> 01:35:37.520
it turns out that if the
universe expanded like this,

01:35:37.520 --> 01:35:41.450
we would expect there to
be a primordial background

01:35:41.450 --> 01:35:44.420
of gravitational waves, very low
frequency gravitational waves.

01:35:44.420 --> 01:35:47.420
Sort of a moaning background
filling the universe.

01:35:47.420 --> 01:35:49.070
And so there's a
lot of experiments

01:35:49.070 --> 01:35:51.313
looking for the imprints
of such gravitational waves

01:35:51.313 --> 01:35:51.980
on our universe.

01:35:51.980 --> 01:35:53.930
If it is measured,
it would allow

01:35:53.930 --> 01:35:57.060
us to directly probe what this
inflationary potential actually

01:35:57.060 --> 01:35:58.580
is.

01:35:58.580 --> 01:36:02.430
I'm going to conclude our
discussion of cosmology here.

01:36:02.430 --> 01:36:05.390
So some of the
quantitative details,

01:36:05.390 --> 01:36:09.740
the way in which inflation
can cure the flatness problem

01:36:09.740 --> 01:36:13.940
and cure the homogeneity problem
you will explore on problem

01:36:13.940 --> 01:36:15.350
set seven.

01:36:15.350 --> 01:36:18.740
Going into the weeds of how
one makes it a scalar field,

01:36:18.740 --> 01:36:21.020
designs a potential and
does things like this

01:36:21.020 --> 01:36:22.850
beyond the scope of 8.962--

01:36:22.850 --> 01:36:27.380
there are courses like
this, and I would not

01:36:27.380 --> 01:36:30.500
be surprised if some of
the people in this class

01:36:30.500 --> 01:36:32.720
spent a lot more time
studying this in their futures

01:36:32.720 --> 01:36:34.400
than I have in my life.

01:36:34.400 --> 01:36:36.260
All right, so that is
where we will conclude

01:36:36.260 --> 01:36:39.190
our discussion of cosmology.

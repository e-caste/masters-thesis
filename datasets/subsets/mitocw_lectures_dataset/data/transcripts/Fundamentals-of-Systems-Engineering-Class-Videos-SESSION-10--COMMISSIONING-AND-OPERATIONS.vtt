00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:27.910
PROFESSOR: The engines,
the aircraft engines,

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:30.610
have a lot of sensors on them
because the engines really

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:31.720
need to work reliably.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:37.090
So it tends to be more sort of
thermal structural components.

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.470
And my sense is in cars, you
monitor more electronics,

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:42.655
how many--

00:00:42.655 --> 00:00:43.650
AUDIENCE: Emissions.

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:44.840
PROFESSOR: --certainly
admissions.

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.798
It's slightly different
what's being monitored,

00:00:46.798 --> 00:00:48.520
and the sensors are different.

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.770
Even the companies that
provide these sensors

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:54.574
and health-monitoring equipment
tend to be different as well.

00:00:54.574 --> 00:00:55.990
I think, there are
similar trends,

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:57.400
but they're somewhat parallel.

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.400
I don't think one
came before the other.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:00:59.970
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:01.350
Yeah.

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.860
PROFESSOR: Hey,
Volcker, do you want

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:07.280
to mention something about
health monitoring in general

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.624
for operations?

00:01:08.624 --> 00:01:13.648
GUEST SPEAKER: I just sent
you a link on your email

00:01:13.648 --> 00:01:17.160
because we've been for six
years monitoring the health

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:18.940
of [INAUDIBLE] that's up there.

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.480
And it's live link,
so I don't know

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.633
if you are able from
your computer to open it.

00:01:24.633 --> 00:01:27.880
I just sent you the
link on your email.

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.360
Right?

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.610
So actually, into
the first satellite

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.240
that we both [INAUDIBLE]
few years ago,

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:36.890
we figured we want
to know everything.

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.970
So the primary [? dom ?]
system were all

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:46.210
sent on every telemetry data
the same [? dom ?] at every path

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.050
and kept actual.

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:52.310
So maybe after break or
whenever there's a chance,

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.100
go to the link, and you can see
the actual housekeeping data.

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.660
And you'll see that the
battery, the voltage,

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:02.110
is the only one
that's [INAUDIBLE]..

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.790
Likely, [INAUDIBLE] of
the six years, which

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.300
is not bad for a VC system.

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.850
PROFESSOR: Yup, OK, I'll
pull it up during the break.

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:12.110
Thanks for that.

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:13.580
That'll be interesting.

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.790
OK, let's move on.

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.760
So unfortunately, I
would say the F-18,

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.350
and there's a lot of systems
that were designed with

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:25.280
operational excellence in mind--

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.860
maintainability,
high reliability.

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.110
That was a big thing.

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:31.790
I did mention this
before, I think,

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.080
but I just want to say that
it's not always the case.

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.640
So this is one of the
counter-examples, the space

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:38.540
shuttle.

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:39.850
And I have a lot of respect.

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:41.420
Don't misunderstand me.

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.360
I think people that worked on
the shuttle did an amazing job.

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.370
It was an amazing vehicle.

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.590
But things turned
out quite differently

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.120
than what was promised.

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.580
I think that everybody
will agree with that.

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:54.920
So this is a paper
that was actually

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.290
a very short paper
published believe it or not

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.550
in nature in 2011 right after
the retirement of the shuttle

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:05.184
and by Pilcke et al.

00:03:05.184 --> 00:03:07.100
And what they did is,
they looked at the costs

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.210
of the shuttle program.

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:09.860
And the cost is well
known because this

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:10.970
is all public money.

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:14.330
This is all money that was
appropriated by Congress.

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.160
And then the light blue
bars are the number

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.050
of launches that happen
in a particular year.

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:21.350
So you can see the
maximum was nine--

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:24.690
nine launches in 1984--

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:29.660
not a launch a week that
Congress had been told.

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:35.200
And so we have about
10 years of design,

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.780
build, test until initial
operating capability.

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.780
And then we have about 30
years of actually usage

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:43.860
and operations.

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.480
And this is true for any system.

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.210
The operational phase is much
longer than the design phase.

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:51.030
So in this case, the
operational phase

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.260
was 30 years right, three times
longer than the actual design

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.660
phase, which was about a decade.

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:00.660
The Vision was a partially
reusable space vehicle,

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.120
quick turnaround,
high flight rate.

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.600
What we actually got is a
complex and fragile vehicle

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.890
with an average cost of
about $1.5 billion for flight

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:13.740
and a workforce of
about 20,000 people

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:16.829
to keep the shuttle flying.

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:19.740
And I think I've shown
you this before, right?

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:21.300
Did I show you this before?

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:24.210
So this is an
original illustration

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.270
from the proposal to Congress.

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.950
It kind of looks like the
F-18 that I just showed you.

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:35.070
It's a hangar,
pristine, a few people,

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:37.830
a couple of ground
support equipment carts--

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:40.890
this is kind of like an
airplane, like an airliner.

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:43.080
And then this is
what we actually got.

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:46.080
This is a picture taken in the
Orbiter Processing Facility

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.790
at the Kennedy Space Center.

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:50.220
And you can't even see
the shuttle, right?

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:53.360
It's hidden behind
the scaffolding,

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.560
and the main systems
that required

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.510
a lot of work between
flights were the shuttle

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:00.900
main engine and of course the
TPS, the thermal protection

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:01.770
system.

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:05.460
Now, you can say, well why such
a big discrepancy between what

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:09.384
was promised, the Vision, and
what's actually delivered?

00:05:09.384 --> 00:05:11.050
And people will have
different opinions.

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:14.920
My opinion is, certainly
over-optimism was a part of it.

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:19.540
But also Congress kept
the research development

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:23.330
costs for the Orbiter in
particular to about 5.1,

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:23.980
5 billion.

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:25.660
There was actually
an act of Congress

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:30.040
that said those shall not
spend more 5.1, 5 billion

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:31.960
on development of the Orbiter.

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:36.550
So then, when it was clear, 24
metric tons to low-earth orbit.

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:40.970
If you can't achieve that,
the system will not satisfy.

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:44.620
So performance is king,
and of course, this

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:46.930
was also a politically
challenging

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:48.730
because there were
military requirements

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:51.100
and civilian requirements
that had to be met.

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:53.880
And then maintainability,
like I said,

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:56.120
just doesn't happen
automatically.

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:57.880
You have to actually
write requirements

00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:59.140
for maintainability.

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:00.590
How long should it take?

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:02.410
How many hours of work?

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:07.030
How many actions or procedures
to do certain maintenance

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:07.540
actions?

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:10.480
It has to be designed
into the system, therefore

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:12.370
the need for requirements.

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:17.320
And then no realistic lifecycle
cost or value optimization.

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:20.990
So that's, I think,
the counter-example.

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:23.950
But again, I am not blaming
individuals for this.

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:26.890
I'm blaming the system for this.

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:28.159
Yes?

00:06:28.159 --> 00:06:29.700
AUDIENCE: To what
extent do you think

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:32.170
that kind of problems
within shuttle

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:36.250
can be traced to effectively
a failure to stop

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:37.780
defining the requirements?

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:41.100
I feel like when you look
at commercial launch systems

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:42.350
kind of as a comparison point.

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:45.100
And I understand
they're not reusable.

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:47.590
And they're not being
designed to necessarily

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:49.390
the same specifications
as shuttle.

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:52.870
But I feel like because the
commercial launch industry

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:55.450
has had standards set by
NASA and the Air Force

00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:57.280
that they needed
to meet, that they

00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:59.050
had a very clear
set of requirements

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:00.100
from the beginning.

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:01.630
Whereas the
development of shuttle,

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:05.410
like the failure to design
for maintainability,

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:07.030
when I look at the
development cycle,

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:09.280
it looks like they continue
to refine requirements

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:11.730
as they went and kind of
discovered new things.

00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:14.022
And then said, OK, so we need
to do it this way instead

00:07:14.022 --> 00:07:16.104
of saying from the beginning,
these departments we

00:07:16.104 --> 00:07:17.030
know we have to meet.

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:17.924
Let's design to that.

00:07:17.924 --> 00:07:19.090
PROFESSOR: Right, though I--

00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:19.690
AUDIENCE: It look
like they kind of

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:21.400
crept through the
development phase

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:23.295
to me, that there
was no hard stop.

00:07:23.295 --> 00:07:25.921
So I was just wondering if you
could comment on that kind of--

00:07:25.921 --> 00:07:27.670
PROFESSOR: It's
definitely true that there

00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:29.520
was sort of reacting to--

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:30.760
and after the first few--

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:34.930
so an interesting history there
is the shuttle main engines.

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:38.350
They were completely
disassembled and inspected

00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:40.450
after the first
couple of flights.

00:07:40.450 --> 00:07:42.660
But that wasn't supposed
to be done every flight.

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:44.784
It was supposed to be,
you're going to launch them,

00:07:44.784 --> 00:07:47.380
I think, like five times
before you actually

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:49.240
do big inspections.

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:50.980
But they had already
done inspections

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:52.600
after every test flight.

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:54.670
And then they just
kept doing it.

00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:59.500
So something that was supposed
to be only a maintenance

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:02.860
action or inspection
during test flights

00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:06.390
became or crept into becoming
an operational requirement.

00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:08.650
And of course, you
have a big workforce

00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:10.910
and there's jobs and so forth.

00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:12.160
So there's that too.

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:15.340
But it was never intended
that the shuttle main engines

00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:18.370
would be disassembled and
rebuilt after every flight.

00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:22.030
AUDIENCE: Why was
that permitted?

00:08:22.030 --> 00:08:24.100
PROFESSOR: Well,
I guess, the sense

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:26.736
was that it would
be safer to do that,

00:08:26.736 --> 00:08:28.360
and that you really
want to know what's

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:30.100
the state of these engines.

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:34.030
And I will say this, I
mean at the contractual,

00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:35.710
there's jobs there.

00:08:35.710 --> 00:08:36.970
There's money there.

00:08:36.970 --> 00:08:40.539
And so the more maintenance
actions you can do,

00:08:40.539 --> 00:08:42.580
the more of a business this is.

00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:44.780
But of course, that's
not what the Vision was.

00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:48.430
The Vision was a very lean,
operations, few people.

00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:52.512
So there's a socioeconomic
things tied up with it as well.

00:08:52.512 --> 00:08:54.720
AUDIENCE: Do you think that
because that's inherently

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:57.166
a government project
that's part of the reason?

00:08:57.166 --> 00:08:58.540
Like whereas a
commercial company

00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:00.520
is looking to cut as many
employees as possible

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:02.050
to increase profit margin?

00:09:02.050 --> 00:09:03.400
PROFESSOR: I think that
that's a part of it.

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:03.700
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:05.700
PROFESSOR: Yeah, I do
think that's a part of it.

00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:12.230
Yeah, absolutely, it's a
really interesting history.

00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:14.290
There's a lot to be
learned from this.

00:09:14.290 --> 00:09:16.960
OK, so let me move on.

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:21.370
So this is kind of a list, not
a checklist really, but a list

00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:23.560
of operational considerations
that you should think

00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:25.570
about when you design a system.

00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:27.550
So how will it be operated?

00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:31.100
And of course, we've done
the CONOPS a while ago,

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:33.280
but this is sort of more
detailed than the CONOPS.

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:35.380
How will you inspect the system?

00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:38.140
How will you maintain it?

00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:41.920
What insights do the operators
need into the system status?

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:44.110
So when you are
operating the system,

00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:46.270
how much about the
internal workings

00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:47.530
do you really need to know?

00:09:47.530 --> 00:09:53.164
This is the internal telemetry
temperatures, pressures,

00:09:53.164 --> 00:09:56.410
in the avionics, the electrical.

00:09:56.410 --> 00:09:58.630
I think the example of the
electrical bus was good,

00:09:58.630 --> 00:10:04.180
the cryogenics system example,
how much insight do you need?

00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:06.910
Before turning over to the
operators, what checks do

00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:08.280
you need to perform?

00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:10.270
How might the system fail?

00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:13.030
Think about failure,
and you of course

00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:15.670
need to think about that
as early as possible.

00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:17.740
What are the options
available to you

00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:19.180
in case you have failures?

00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:21.040
And you will have failures.

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:23.830
What spares are needed
to repair the system?

00:10:23.830 --> 00:10:27.190
Will this system still perform
even under partial failure?

00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:29.950
So maybe something failed
but not catastrophically.

00:10:29.950 --> 00:10:31.270
It's a partial failure.

00:10:31.270 --> 00:10:33.340
Can you keep going
with the system?

00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:37.270
How far can you push the system?

00:10:37.270 --> 00:10:41.184
I think if you think about this
is like five questions here,

00:10:41.184 --> 00:10:43.600
but I think, they are five of
the most important questions

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:46.400
for operations.

00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:49.340
Now in terms of
the NASA lifecycle,

00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:51.800
we're talking Phase E
here, just to be clear.

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:55.460
So Phase E is called
Operations and Sustainment.

00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:59.510
And depending on what
mission you're talking about,

00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:01.970
this could be short--

00:11:01.970 --> 00:11:06.170
like the Apollo missions, like
two weeks and they're back

00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:07.940
home--

00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:10.760
ISS, six months rotations.

00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:14.450
Or it could be
something like Voyager.

00:11:14.450 --> 00:11:18.720
Voyager was launched
when in '76?

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:21.650
Voyager's been
flying for 40 years,

00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:24.920
and we're still getting data
and telemetry at very low data

00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:27.770
rates, like 100 bits per
second or something like this.

00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:29.990
But still, that's
remarkable, right?

00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:33.930
So Phase E, in that
case, is very long.

00:11:33.930 --> 00:11:37.190
So it's worth really
thinking about this.

00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:39.930
All right, let me talk
about commissioning.

00:11:39.930 --> 00:11:42.870
So commissioning is
essentially the transition

00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:45.360
from Phase D to
Phase E. So Phase D

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:49.290
is System Assembly,
Integration, Test, and Launch,

00:11:49.290 --> 00:11:51.310
and Transition to Use.

00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:54.030
And Phase E is then
Operations and Sustainment.

00:11:54.030 --> 00:11:57.420
So to conduct the mission, meet
the initially-identified need,

00:11:57.420 --> 00:11:59.640
maintain support,
and then implement

00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:01.500
your mission operations plan.

00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:04.590
So commissioning,
essentially, is transitioning

00:12:04.590 --> 00:12:08.130
from Phase D to
Phase E. And usually,

00:12:08.130 --> 00:12:11.580
the people that will operate
the system day in, day out,

00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:14.790
tend to be different
people than the people who

00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:18.330
design the system, who build the
system, who launch the system.

00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:21.630
So usually, you have some
kind of a handoff or handover

00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:25.830
of the system from the
designers, builders

00:12:25.830 --> 00:12:27.240
to the operators.

00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:31.050
And that handover is very
important that it be done well.

00:12:31.050 --> 00:12:34.580
And that's what we
call commissioning.

00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:37.820
Or in this case, this is
the-- do you remember this?

00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:39.800
We haven't shown
this for a while.

00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:43.340
Remember what do we call
this, this thing here?

00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:44.150
The engine, right?

00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:47.320
The system's engineering
engine at every level.

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:51.770
So this is Step 9, Product
Transitioning Process.

00:12:51.770 --> 00:12:55.040
And then there has to
be a flow chart, right?

00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:57.410
Can't do without a flow chart.

00:12:57.410 --> 00:13:00.680
It's not particularly
fancy or anything,

00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:03.710
but the idea is that
you have inputs,

00:13:03.710 --> 00:13:07.880
which are the end product,
ready to be used, documentation.

00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:12.140
So when I ask you about
the cryogenic system--

00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:13.970
you mentioned the
cryogenic system--

00:13:13.970 --> 00:13:16.970
I ask you, do you have
a user manual for it?

00:13:16.970 --> 00:13:19.640
So that would be here, in this
box here, on the left side--

00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:22.880
the documentation that
goes with the end product.

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:25.647
And then any product
transition-enabling products,

00:13:25.647 --> 00:13:27.230
so those would be
things that you only

00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:31.940
use during the transition,
like equipment or facilities

00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:35.750
that you just use for this
transitioning process.

00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:39.330
And then you don't use
them during operations.

00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:41.760
You can think of
examples of that.

00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:44.820
And then you go through
this multiple steps.

00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:47.390
There may be multiple sites
that you have to prepare,

00:13:47.390 --> 00:13:49.310
multiple locations.

00:13:49.310 --> 00:13:53.120
And at the end of it, you've
delivered the end product.

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:56.900
It's operational,
transition work products,

00:13:56.900 --> 00:14:00.500
and you're essentially
operational.

00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:04.190
So what it means in
practice is deploying

00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:07.820
the system in the field,
transitioning to the operators,

00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:09.890
physically and legally also--

00:14:09.890 --> 00:14:11.040
I should point this out.

00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:12.710
This is really important.

00:14:12.710 --> 00:14:18.020
So usually, in this
commissioning phase,

00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:20.510
the legal ownership of
the product or the asset

00:14:20.510 --> 00:14:23.360
is transferred from one
organization to the other.

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:26.180
So if it breaks now,
it's your problem.

00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:27.230
It's not my problem.

00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:28.770
You've already taken ownership.

00:14:28.770 --> 00:14:30.195
You've signed off on it.

00:14:30.195 --> 00:14:33.920
And for insurance purposes,
this is a very big deal.

00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:36.830
So at what point
does legal ownership

00:14:36.830 --> 00:14:38.380
of the asset transition?

00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:40.680
You really have to know that.

00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:42.920
And then, of course,
the training.

00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:46.730
Checkout-- checkout means
turning on all your systems

00:14:46.730 --> 00:14:50.090
and subsystems, making
sure everything works,

00:14:50.090 --> 00:14:53.210
making sure there's no emergent
behaviors, weird behaviors,

00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:54.950
unexpected behaviors.

00:14:54.950 --> 00:14:57.740
Comparing the
predicted parameters

00:14:57.740 --> 00:14:59.300
against the actual behaviors.

00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:02.140
Does the system behave
as we had predicted,

00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:04.280
based on calculations?

00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:07.250
These days, we usually
build simulations.

00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:10.550
We build a pretty realistic
simulation of the system,

00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:14.990
and there's the concept
of digital twin.

00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:16.060
Who's heard this before?

00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:17.360
Digital twin.

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:18.680
Who's heard this before?

00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:20.300
Oh, nobody, OK.

00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:23.270
So the idea of a digital
twin is that here's

00:15:23.270 --> 00:15:27.770
your physical system,
airplane, satellite, cube sat,

00:15:27.770 --> 00:15:30.470
whatever it is, medical device.

00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:33.080
And there's a
digital twin of it.

00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:38.720
There's a in silico
version, a simulated twin,

00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:41.810
of that system that
exists somewhere.

00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:45.320
And before you turn the system
on and do operations on it,

00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:48.110
you do it on the
digital twin to see

00:15:48.110 --> 00:15:50.330
what will happen and
predict everything--

00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:53.300
all the parameters,
the position, velocity,

00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:56.460
accelerations,
temperatures, pressures.

00:15:56.460 --> 00:15:59.270
So if things look good
in the digital twin,

00:15:59.270 --> 00:16:01.320
then you actually do
it in the real system.

00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:05.550
So for example, JPL with their
Mars rovers, they will do that.

00:16:05.550 --> 00:16:08.000
They have a digital twin,
they have a digital version.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.760
They actually have
a physical twin too.

00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:13.310
But they typically only use
that if there's problems,

00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:15.640
like stuck in a sand dune
or something like that.

00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:19.670
So you actually
simulate commands

00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:21.530
that you're going to
send to the spacecraft

00:16:21.530 --> 00:16:25.310
on your digital twin, make sure
that the command sequence is

00:16:25.310 --> 00:16:28.790
correct, that things will--

00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:31.250
and then you do it
on the real system.

00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:33.080
That's what we mean here.

00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:35.267
And during checkout,
you do it initially.

00:16:35.267 --> 00:16:37.100
But actually, if it's
a very complex system,

00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:40.760
you might do this as
a matter of routine.

00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:43.790
And then sustainment is
the third thing here.

00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:46.940
So sustainment means
maintenance, both preventative

00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:48.176
and corrective.

00:16:48.176 --> 00:16:49.550
So preventative
maintenance means

00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:52.340
you're taking actions
before the system breaks.

00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:55.610
Corrective action means you're
taking maintenance actions

00:16:55.610 --> 00:16:59.720
after you have failures of
different kind-- spare parts

00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:03.680
management, reconfiguring
system during use

00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:06.079
for different purposes,
upgrading system,

00:17:06.079 --> 00:17:07.730
and then retrofits.

00:17:07.730 --> 00:17:11.540
So what is a retrofit?

00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:12.990
Anybody know?

00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:15.736
At EPFL, are you familiar
with the term retrofit?

00:17:15.736 --> 00:17:17.069
Have you heard this word before?

00:17:19.609 --> 00:17:23.030
Volcker, do you want to
explain what it means?

00:17:23.030 --> 00:17:24.461
GUEST SPEAKER: Absolutely.

00:17:24.461 --> 00:17:28.810
So for example, let's take your
[INAUDIBLE] system, the system

00:17:28.810 --> 00:17:30.600
volt's M109.

00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:32.970
Ours says from USA.

00:17:32.970 --> 00:17:37.634
Back in the '60s, '70s, then
these things are aluminum,

00:17:37.634 --> 00:17:40.130
launch self-propelled.

00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:44.470
And in the '80s, '90s, they
decided to not throw them away.

00:17:44.470 --> 00:17:45.890
They don't rust.

00:17:45.890 --> 00:17:49.570
But to retrofit them, to
put guidance navigation

00:17:49.570 --> 00:17:51.022
system, new cam.

00:17:51.022 --> 00:17:52.740
So waiting through
a retrofit program,

00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:55.856
meaning you sort of
break down everything,

00:17:55.856 --> 00:17:59.690
down to the lowest elements,
you decide what you can keep.

00:17:59.690 --> 00:18:03.080
You throw away the
obsolete stuff.

00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:04.905
You buy new things,
and you try to make it.

00:18:04.905 --> 00:18:05.530
PROFESSOR: Yup.

00:18:05.530 --> 00:18:07.290
GUEST SPEAKER: And
then you reconfigure.

00:18:07.290 --> 00:18:09.510
PROFESSOR: So retrofit
typically means

00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:11.640
you physically go
out in the field,

00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:14.760
and you physically
change the system.

00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:16.530
Like Volcker said,
you remove things,

00:18:16.530 --> 00:18:18.540
you typically add new things.

00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:21.480
So now you have like old
generation and new generation

00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:23.760
stuff mixed up in the system.

00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:27.330
Retrofitting is a huge deal,
particularly in the military,

00:18:27.330 --> 00:18:34.110
but in other domains as well,
like hospitals, infrastructure,

00:18:34.110 --> 00:18:35.910
train systems.

00:18:35.910 --> 00:18:41.269
You go there, and you
see a mix of old stuff

00:18:41.269 --> 00:18:43.560
from when the system was
originally built and deployed,

00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:47.040
and then new stuff layered on
top of it through retrofits.

00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:50.910
And the key question, of course,
when you do a retrofit is,

00:18:50.910 --> 00:18:53.720
you want the retrofit
not to interfere.

00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:56.100
You want it to actually
be value added as opposed

00:18:56.100 --> 00:18:57.740
to causing more problems.

00:18:57.740 --> 00:18:59.040
Yeah, go ahead.

00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:03.720
AUDIENCE: Is retrofit the
same as medium-life up grade?

00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:05.220
PROFESSOR: I would
say it this way--

00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:10.170
a medium-life or
middle-of-the-life upgrade is

00:19:10.170 --> 00:19:13.800
a particular type of retrofit
that you do roughly halfway

00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:15.830
through the nominal
mission life.

00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:21.510
Yes, and do you have
experience with such upgrade?

00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:25.800
AUDIENCE: Yes, actually we have
both F-5 and AMX in Brazil.

00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:29.897
We have the medium-life upgrade
and both performed by Embraer.

00:19:29.897 --> 00:19:30.480
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:32.938
AUDIENCE: So it's interesting
because the F-5, for example,

00:19:32.938 --> 00:19:33.480
is Northrop.

00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:36.150
And the medium-life upgrade
was performed by Embraer.

00:19:36.150 --> 00:19:38.520
And we had lots of
issues about it.

00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:41.230
PROFESSOR: So what was
done to the airplane?

00:19:41.230 --> 00:19:45.120
AUDIENCE: Completely change
of the dashboard panels

00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:48.855
and new electronic
warfare equipment.

00:19:48.855 --> 00:19:54.450
But they kept the old
hydraulics engine and--

00:19:54.450 --> 00:19:55.950
actually, hydraulics and engine.

00:19:55.950 --> 00:19:58.269
The electrical system
was changed as well.

00:19:58.269 --> 00:19:59.560
PROFESSOR: Was changed as well.

00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:02.190
So you keep the
frame, the engine--

00:20:02.190 --> 00:20:04.290
AUDIENCE: And you change
the radar, the antennas,

00:20:04.290 --> 00:20:05.494
and lots of different stuff.

00:20:05.494 --> 00:20:06.660
PROFESSOR: That makes sense.

00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:07.368
That makes sense.

00:20:07.368 --> 00:20:11.100
AUDIENCE: A new head-up display,
a new helmet, stuff like that.

00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:12.880
PROFESSOR: The
interesting discussion,

00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:15.880
which I think in the
US for much equipment,

00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:17.520
and Switzerland
same discussions,

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:22.020
is by the time you start
adding up the cost of a midlife

00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:25.890
upgrade or retrofit, you start
adding all these things up,

00:20:25.890 --> 00:20:27.690
pretty quickly you
come to the question,

00:20:27.690 --> 00:20:29.670
well, wow that's
pretty expensive.

00:20:29.670 --> 00:20:34.080
Is it really worth it,
investing x millions or billions

00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:39.200
to squeeze another 10, 15
years out of this platform?

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:42.740
Or should we just buy a new
one and retire this one?

00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:45.330
And you'll have very
vigorous debates about that.

00:20:45.330 --> 00:20:46.417
Yeah?

00:20:46.417 --> 00:20:48.500
AUDIENCE: Just how does
the funding structure ever

00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:51.380
come into play when
determining how sustainable,

00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:53.170
or how you're going
to retrofit something?

00:20:53.170 --> 00:20:55.790
I know sometimes,
where you worked

00:20:55.790 --> 00:20:57.830
funding ends this time
and something else

00:20:57.830 --> 00:20:58.840
starts up this time.

00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:00.230
So sometimes, you kind
of design a little bit

00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:01.063
around those things.

00:21:01.063 --> 00:21:03.070
Is that ever taken
into consideration?

00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:05.810
PROFESSOR: Well, I think
enlightened companies,

00:21:05.810 --> 00:21:11.030
enlightened organizations will
actually build in retrofit

00:21:11.030 --> 00:21:14.390
and upgrade costs into
their original budgets.

00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:19.190
But does it happen often?

00:21:19.190 --> 00:21:21.680
I think it's a minority of
organizations who really

00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:25.170
are honest to think about
the full lifecycle cost,

00:21:25.170 --> 00:21:27.170
including upgrades
and retrofits.

00:21:27.170 --> 00:21:30.410
And to be honest,
sometimes, these retrofits,

00:21:30.410 --> 00:21:32.360
it's hard to know about
them ahead of time.

00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:36.260
In some cases you can predict
them, but in many cases,

00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:37.460
it's more reactive.

00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:43.370
In fact, I'll tell you
a story about the F-18.

00:21:43.370 --> 00:21:46.640
These retrofits often come
in bundles or packages

00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:51.830
called ECPs, Engineering
Change Proposals.

00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:54.200
They're sort of
packages of changes.

00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:57.920
And it's almost
blackmail, but it's

00:21:57.920 --> 00:22:03.110
like, here's a bundle of changes
that is x million dollars.

00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:07.890
And it's up to you whether you
want to implement that or not.

00:22:07.890 --> 00:22:09.630
But if you choose
not to implement,

00:22:09.630 --> 00:22:12.870
then the warranty is void.

00:22:12.870 --> 00:22:18.390
Or you're losing compatibility
with any future upgrades.

00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:19.950
Do you see what I'm saying?

00:22:19.950 --> 00:22:23.400
So the configurations
then start to diverge.

00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:26.830
And then you have to
make a tough decision.

00:22:26.830 --> 00:22:30.690
Do you spend money on an upgrade
that maybe you don't absolutely

00:22:30.690 --> 00:22:34.770
need, but some other
customers wanted?

00:22:34.770 --> 00:22:36.780
And if you say no,
we don't want this.

00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:38.460
We're going to freeze
the configuration

00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:39.870
where we are today.

00:22:39.870 --> 00:22:43.260
Then, you might lose the
option for future upgrades.

00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:45.090
And if you then choose
to upgrade later,

00:22:45.090 --> 00:22:46.960
it could be much more expensive.

00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:52.650
And that's systems
engineering too.

00:22:52.650 --> 00:22:55.800
And it gets into technical
issue, financial issues,

00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:57.540
strategic issues.

00:22:57.540 --> 00:23:02.040
So I hope you're getting a
sense here that this is all

00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:03.300
happening during operations.

00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:04.890
This is fascinating stuff.

00:23:04.890 --> 00:23:06.180
This is not boring.

00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:09.260
This is not just
routine operations.

00:23:09.260 --> 00:23:16.700
OK, so in operations, we have
launch for spacecraft science

00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:21.230
operations, safehold, anomaly
resolution, and so forth.

00:23:21.230 --> 00:23:24.110
And I just want to show
you a quick video here

00:23:24.110 --> 00:23:28.280
about the James Webb--
this is a one-minute video

00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:31.520
about the anticipated deployment
of the James Webb Space

00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:32.484
Telescope.

00:23:32.484 --> 00:23:33.650
I think, I mentioned to you.

00:23:33.650 --> 00:23:37.550
I've worked on this
as a Master's student.

00:23:37.550 --> 00:23:40.020
This is supposed
to happen in 2018,

00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:42.410
launch from Kourou
on an Ariane rocket.

00:23:42.410 --> 00:23:48.380
This is a NASA-ISA
collaboration.

00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:51.540
You can see right now, the
spacecraft has been launched.

00:23:51.540 --> 00:23:54.710
It's deploying its sunshield.

00:23:54.710 --> 00:23:56.630
These are very thin membranes.

00:23:56.630 --> 00:23:59.720
The purpose of the sunshield
is to keep the optics cold.

00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:01.910
The optics are on the top here.

00:24:01.910 --> 00:24:06.920
And there's spreaders, and
there shouldn't be any wrinkles.

00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:08.280
And there's multiple layers.

00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:09.360
You can see the layers.

00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:11.940
Now, first you spread
it out horizontally.

00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:14.060
Now, the layers are
being spread to be

00:24:14.060 --> 00:24:16.490
right at the right angles.

00:24:16.490 --> 00:24:20.430
And I don't know what's
happening right now.

00:24:20.430 --> 00:24:30.170
But the last step
that should happen--

00:24:30.170 --> 00:24:32.510
I guess it didn't quite
play until the end.

00:24:32.510 --> 00:24:33.980
But the last thing
that happens is

00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:35.660
the optics are then deployed.

00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:40.580
And the optical deployment
is also very, very involved

00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:43.250
and has to be very precise.

00:24:43.250 --> 00:24:47.410
So let me just minimize this.

00:24:47.410 --> 00:24:51.250
So and then after that,
you have a commissioning.

00:24:51.250 --> 00:24:53.530
I should also mention
that the James Webb State,

00:24:53.530 --> 00:24:56.500
when I worked on it, it
was a $500-million mission.

00:24:56.500 --> 00:24:59.900
It's now become an
$8-billion mission.

00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:01.520
But the purpose
of this instrument

00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:06.050
is to look back in time to
what's known as the dark ages.

00:25:06.050 --> 00:25:10.370
It's basically like 300,000
years to about 100 million

00:25:10.370 --> 00:25:12.140
years after the Big Bang.

00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:15.080
The formation of the very
first Pluto galaxies.

00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:18.350
We can't observe that right now
with Hubble or from the ground,

00:25:18.350 --> 00:25:20.930
mainly because these
are so far away because

00:25:20.930 --> 00:25:24.380
of the expansion of the
universe that the radiation is

00:25:24.380 --> 00:25:25.400
redshifted.

00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:27.300
And this is all in the infrared.

00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:30.560
So you to have a very quiet,
very cold instrument to

00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:33.480
see these first
proto-galaxies being formed.

00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:37.040
So I know we can argue, is
it worth spending 8 billion

00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:39.410
to see the very first
galaxy being formed or not?

00:25:39.410 --> 00:25:40.360
People will debate it.

00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:43.520
But the fact is, it's happening.

00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:45.225
James Webb will launch.

00:25:45.225 --> 00:25:47.600
And then, it's going to go
through a commissioning phase,

00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:49.290
like I just talked about.

00:25:49.290 --> 00:25:52.910
So I want you to answer
this question here.

00:25:52.910 --> 00:25:55.190
How long do you think
the commissioning

00:25:55.190 --> 00:25:58.750
phase of the James Webb
Space Telescope will take?

00:25:58.750 --> 00:26:00.070
Three days, a week--

00:26:00.070 --> 00:26:02.140
in orbit that is.

00:26:02.140 --> 00:26:05.270
Three days, a week, three
weeks, a month, three months,

00:26:05.270 --> 00:26:07.180
six months, or you're not sure.

00:26:07.180 --> 00:26:09.850
So answer that question, and
then we'll take a short break,

00:26:09.850 --> 00:26:15.272
like five minutes, and
look at the answer.

00:26:15.272 --> 00:26:16.706
Yup?

00:26:16.706 --> 00:26:21.180
AUDIENCE: Are they still on
schedule with the telescope?

00:26:21.180 --> 00:26:22.870
Or do you have any
idea on whether that

00:26:22.870 --> 00:26:24.314
will slip some more?

00:26:24.314 --> 00:26:25.730
PROFESSOR: When I
worked on it, it

00:26:25.730 --> 00:26:32.450
was supposed to launch in 2008.

00:26:32.450 --> 00:26:33.380
But I do think--

00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:36.080
I mean, the spacecraft is
being integrated right now

00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:37.970
at Northrop Grumman.

00:26:37.970 --> 00:26:39.980
We saw it in January.

00:26:39.980 --> 00:26:42.440
So they're not lying
to us, I think.

00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:44.900
They're actually
putting things together.

00:26:44.900 --> 00:26:50.180
And I think, it's
going to launch in 20--

00:26:50.180 --> 00:26:52.190
maybe slip by another
six months, or maybe

00:26:52.190 --> 00:26:53.630
a year but not more.

00:26:53.630 --> 00:26:55.280
I don't think so.

00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:58.430
Basically, how long does
it take from what you just

00:26:58.430 --> 00:27:03.255
saw in the video until
PIs, Principal Investigator

00:27:03.255 --> 00:27:03.755
scientists--

00:27:03.755 --> 00:27:04.100
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:05.330
AUDIENCE: Can start using it.

00:27:05.330 --> 00:27:07.610
PROFESSOR: --can start
using it for real science.

00:27:07.610 --> 00:27:09.440
How long will that take?

00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:12.160
So who wants to respond?

00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:16.400
Who thinks it's like a
month, three weeks, a week?

00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:17.620
A month or less?

00:27:17.620 --> 00:27:20.020
Who responded to
that, a month or less.

00:27:20.020 --> 00:27:21.810
Go ahead.

00:27:21.810 --> 00:27:22.910
What were you thinking?

00:27:25.790 --> 00:27:27.344
AUDIENCE: No specific idea.

00:27:27.344 --> 00:27:28.760
PROFESSOR: What
were you imagining

00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:29.759
would happen in a month?

00:27:29.759 --> 00:27:32.060
AUDIENCE: I thought that
it couldn't be very, very

00:27:32.060 --> 00:27:38.880
long because if the objective
is to collect the data,

00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:41.750
you can't wait that much
before you start using it.

00:27:41.750 --> 00:27:44.360
But I had no specific ideas.

00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:46.730
PROFESSOR: No, I think
that's a good answer.

00:27:46.730 --> 00:27:53.210
You deploy the solar panels,
the sunshield, the optics,

00:27:53.210 --> 00:27:54.710
the spacecraft's
at the right place.

00:27:54.710 --> 00:27:56.580
By the way, this is
going to launch too

00:27:56.580 --> 00:28:00.020
in Earth-trailing orbit,
like Earth-Sun L2, kind

00:28:00.020 --> 00:28:01.220
of trailing orbit.

00:28:01.220 --> 00:28:05.000
So it's kind of away from the
Earth, from albedo, all that.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.640
So you deployed it,
let's get on with it.

00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:08.540
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:08.540 --> 00:28:11.360
Yeah, I agree.

00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:14.120
And then I think, 37%
of you, a third of you

00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:18.590
thought maybe three months,
and then 40% about six months.

00:28:18.590 --> 00:28:22.480
All right, so let's look
at the current plans.

00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:25.280
And I took some slides here--

00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:27.770
I referenced it--
from a lady that

00:28:27.770 --> 00:28:30.920
works at the Space Telescope
Science Institute that's

00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:34.460
located in Baltimore,
the NASA's Goddard Space

00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:35.480
Center of Baltimore.

00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:37.410
This is from last year.

00:28:37.410 --> 00:28:41.180
So here's the plan to
launch in October of 2018,

00:28:41.180 --> 00:28:42.500
and then do the deployment.

00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:45.440
And the answer is
right now six months.

00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:47.940
Six months commissioning phase--

00:28:47.940 --> 00:28:50.080
and then, there's
different cycles

00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:53.300
of-- so GO stands
for guest observer.

00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:55.260
So you have primary PIs.

00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:56.990
They usually get first dibs.

00:28:56.990 --> 00:29:02.390
And then you have observing
time for guest observers.

00:29:02.390 --> 00:29:04.310
Here's another little
bit more detail.

00:29:04.310 --> 00:29:07.730
So full schedule of deployment
and check-out activities,

00:29:07.730 --> 00:29:09.960
a limited set of
science calibration

00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:13.340
ops possible, science
observations highly unlikely

00:29:13.340 --> 00:29:15.230
during this six-months phase.

00:29:15.230 --> 00:29:18.040
And then, you have this
Guest Observer Program,

00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:22.430
and there's a budget, actually,
Guaranteed Time Observation

00:29:22.430 --> 00:29:26.070
Program from April of 2019--

00:29:26.070 --> 00:29:31.460
a total of 3,960 hours
allocated in the first 30 months

00:29:31.460 --> 00:29:34.230
after commissioning, OK?

00:29:34.230 --> 00:29:38.810
And so those 3,960 hours are--

00:29:38.810 --> 00:29:40.160
people will fight over this.

00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:41.900
And there's a very
detailed process

00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:46.280
for how to allocate and compete
for that observation time.

00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:47.870
But the answer
here is six months.

00:29:47.870 --> 00:29:50.780
And it really surprised
me too that it's

00:29:50.780 --> 00:29:56.660
going to take this long but
the reason it takes so long

00:29:56.660 --> 00:29:59.030
is mainly calibration.

00:29:59.030 --> 00:30:00.650
Calibration is a big thing.

00:30:00.650 --> 00:30:03.770
You want to make sure that
all the observations you're

00:30:03.770 --> 00:30:05.840
going to take are correct.

00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:08.180
And in order to do a
proper calibration,

00:30:08.180 --> 00:30:11.870
you have to essentially image
things that have already

00:30:11.870 --> 00:30:15.050
been imaged before by other
instruments that were also

00:30:15.050 --> 00:30:16.640
properly calibrated.

00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:19.310
So that for a known
set of targets,

00:30:19.310 --> 00:30:21.350
you know you're getting
the same answer.

00:30:21.350 --> 00:30:23.510
And that just takes time.

00:30:23.510 --> 00:30:25.700
I think, in a nutshell,
that's the main reason it

00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:27.070
takes so long.

00:30:27.070 --> 00:30:28.130
GUEST SPEAKER: Pardon me?

00:30:28.130 --> 00:30:30.021
PROFESSOR: Yup, go ahead.

00:30:30.021 --> 00:30:31.770
GUEST SPEAKER: There's
also the one aspect

00:30:31.770 --> 00:30:35.620
with this observatory is that
you have to be stabilized.

00:30:35.620 --> 00:30:39.050
And as you get to bring it
up from Earth, even though it

00:30:39.050 --> 00:30:42.194
was pulled together in a
clean, very high [INAUDIBLE],,

00:30:42.194 --> 00:30:43.402
it's going to have to deploy.

00:30:43.402 --> 00:30:46.250
And then, just to get to
the chemical stabilization,

00:30:46.250 --> 00:30:49.740
it's going to spend weeks
before they even can start

00:30:49.740 --> 00:30:51.346
to calibrate the instruments.

00:30:51.346 --> 00:30:52.820
So for you to get
the outgassing,

00:30:52.820 --> 00:30:55.170
the whole volatile
substances and get

00:30:55.170 --> 00:30:58.232
that they move far away, not
from the spacecraft, that they

00:30:58.232 --> 00:31:02.035
dilute in space, get
stabilization of temperature,

00:31:02.035 --> 00:31:04.512
and then you can only
start checking instruments.

00:31:04.512 --> 00:31:05.470
PROFESSOR: Great point.

00:31:05.470 --> 00:31:08.070
So thermal stability,
outgassing--

00:31:08.070 --> 00:31:10.100
so really everything
is very stable.

00:31:10.100 --> 00:31:12.060
Yeah, very good point.

00:31:12.060 --> 00:31:15.280
OK, so let me talk briefly.

00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:17.580
I'm going to go through
two examples of research

00:31:17.580 --> 00:31:18.540
in operations.

00:31:18.540 --> 00:31:22.190
And then, we'll talk about
the post-flight review.

00:31:22.190 --> 00:31:26.060
All right, so the first thing
is, each of these two examples

00:31:26.060 --> 00:31:26.980
are based on papers.

00:31:26.980 --> 00:31:29.900
So "Spare parts requirements
for space missions

00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:32.570
with reconfigurability
and commonality."

00:31:32.570 --> 00:31:35.880
This is based on a paper
in Journal of Spacecraft

00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:37.910
and Rockets, 2007.

00:31:37.910 --> 00:31:43.190
So and this work was done during
the Constellation Program which

00:31:43.190 --> 00:31:46.760
was, we're going to
go back to the moon.

00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:49.850
We will re-establish a
human presence on the moon.

00:31:49.850 --> 00:31:52.400
And we're going to bring
a whole bunch of stuff

00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:54.800
with us, more than we did
during Apollo to do this.

00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:56.720
So the picture on
the upper-right,

00:31:56.720 --> 00:32:00.290
you see a habitat on
top of a Lander stage.

00:32:00.290 --> 00:32:03.020
You see an Ascent Vehicle
with a Lander stage.

00:32:03.020 --> 00:32:06.480
You see a Rover that looks kind
of similar to the Lunar Rover,

00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:08.990
but there's also a
pressurized version of it.

00:32:08.990 --> 00:32:11.640
So we're going to bring
a whole bunch of stuff.

00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:16.370
And the challenge is during
operations, things will break.

00:32:16.370 --> 00:32:19.070
So you need to bring spare
parts to support all this.

00:32:19.070 --> 00:32:21.800
And some recent research
we've done in my group

00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:24.560
shows that for Mars,
it's the same problem.

00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:26.570
You're going to stay
there a long time.

00:32:26.570 --> 00:32:28.320
You don't know exactly
what will break.

00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:30.470
But if you want a
high probability

00:32:30.470 --> 00:32:33.110
of being able to
successfully operate,

00:32:33.110 --> 00:32:35.120
you do need to bring spares.

00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:39.260
So the idea that was explored
here is, what if those spares

00:32:39.260 --> 00:32:41.180
could be common
or reconfigurable

00:32:41.180 --> 00:32:43.310
and you can do scavenging?

00:32:43.310 --> 00:32:46.850
So the idea is that, instead
of bringing a dedicated spare--

00:32:46.850 --> 00:32:48.560
if you give these
three systems that

00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:51.760
are shown here, The Habitat, the
Ascent Vehicle, and the Rover,

00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:54.260
to three different
companies to build,

00:32:54.260 --> 00:32:55.940
and they don't
talk to each other,

00:32:55.940 --> 00:32:58.400
and you don't impose any
commonality requirements,

00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:01.410
you're going to get very
different solutions.

00:33:01.410 --> 00:33:03.320
What's the classic
example of this

00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:06.460
in spaceflight,
human spaceflight?

00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:07.330
Apollo 13.

00:33:07.330 --> 00:33:08.730
What happened in Apollo 13?

00:33:11.430 --> 00:33:14.320
The cartridges for
the CO2 scrubbing,

00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:16.470
square cartridges
versus round cartridges.

00:33:16.470 --> 00:33:19.457
The two different contractors,
they didn't talk to each other.

00:33:19.457 --> 00:33:21.790
The government didn't say you
have to make these common,

00:33:21.790 --> 00:33:23.290
so they weren't common.

00:33:23.290 --> 00:33:25.630
So the idea here is,
what is the effect

00:33:25.630 --> 00:33:30.710
of reconfigurable and common
spares on system availability

00:33:30.710 --> 00:33:34.670
if you allow temporary
scavenging and cannibalization

00:33:34.670 --> 00:33:36.550
of systems that aren't used?

00:33:36.550 --> 00:33:40.930
And so one thing you need for
that is an operational profile

00:33:40.930 --> 00:33:42.280
for each element.

00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:44.200
And that's shown
in the lower left.

00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:46.510
So this is essentially a binary.

00:33:46.510 --> 00:33:50.860
Zero means that particular
element is dormant

00:33:50.860 --> 00:33:52.320
or not being used.

00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:54.280
It's kind of in slumber mode.

00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:57.310
And 1 means it's
actively being used.

00:33:57.310 --> 00:34:01.720
And so then we have at each
of these time periods, T1, T2,

00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:03.310
T3--

00:34:03.310 --> 00:34:05.200
our time periods where
there is a change

00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:07.750
in the operational status
of a particular element.

00:34:07.750 --> 00:34:11.530
Either it goes from sleeping
mode to active mode,

00:34:11.530 --> 00:34:14.650
or from active mode
to inactive mode.

00:34:14.650 --> 00:34:17.620
And so knowing these
cycles' operational profiles

00:34:17.620 --> 00:34:19.510
is very important
to do the analysis.

00:34:22.710 --> 00:34:24.519
So this is a little
bit of math here.

00:34:24.519 --> 00:34:26.310
I'm not going to go
through this in detail.

00:34:26.310 --> 00:34:30.960
But basically, when you
do classical sparing,

00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:33.150
and maintainability,
and failure analysis,

00:34:33.150 --> 00:34:38.080
you assume that failures arrive
according to a Poisson process.

00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:43.480
So this is the equation
for a Poisson distribution.

00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:46.540
And then you can see the various
variables that are used here.

00:34:46.540 --> 00:34:51.070
So your lambda is
your failure rate.

00:34:51.070 --> 00:34:56.850
P of n is the probability
they have exactly n failures.

00:34:56.850 --> 00:35:01.080
And then, down here,
we have the spares

00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:02.190
that are available to you.

00:35:02.190 --> 00:35:09.070
And really spares can come
from two different sources.

00:35:09.070 --> 00:35:12.180
One is, you bring spares
with you from Earth.

00:35:12.180 --> 00:35:15.570
So this is a spares from
repository, s sub i.

00:35:15.570 --> 00:35:19.620
These are spares you brought
with you as a pool of spares.

00:35:19.620 --> 00:35:23.400
And then s sub e are spares
that you take out of elements

00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:25.140
that are not being used.

00:35:25.140 --> 00:35:28.380
So these are spares that
are scavenged temporarily

00:35:28.380 --> 00:35:29.580
from inactive elements.

00:35:29.580 --> 00:35:33.210
That's s sub e
minus n sub f, which

00:35:33.210 --> 00:35:37.970
is the number of failures that
have occurred up to that point.

00:35:37.970 --> 00:35:40.570
So the total number of
spares available at any given

00:35:40.570 --> 00:35:43.870
point in time is your
initial spares pool

00:35:43.870 --> 00:35:46.720
plus spares you can
scavenge from other inactive

00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:51.520
elements in the
system, minus elements

00:35:51.520 --> 00:35:53.410
that have already failed.

00:35:53.410 --> 00:35:58.840
And this is assuming no
repair, so you can't repair.

00:35:58.840 --> 00:36:01.240
And it assumes that you
know ahead of time what

00:36:01.240 --> 00:36:03.110
the operational profile is.

00:36:03.110 --> 00:36:05.170
So there's spares
available from elements

00:36:05.170 --> 00:36:07.940
from scavenging is
this equation here.

00:36:07.940 --> 00:36:11.500
It's essentially the sum
over all the elements,

00:36:11.500 --> 00:36:16.390
E. E is the number of
elements in your architecture.

00:36:16.390 --> 00:36:20.650
Q sub E is something known as
quantity per application, QPA

00:36:20.650 --> 00:36:21.880
also.

00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:25.570
So basically, if you have
like a mission computer

00:36:25.570 --> 00:36:30.130
or in like UAVs, we have servos.

00:36:30.130 --> 00:36:31.900
Like, this particular
element has

00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:34.340
six servos, identical servos.

00:36:34.340 --> 00:36:36.110
They're used on the vehicle.

00:36:36.110 --> 00:36:40.520
So QPA, this QE would be 6.

00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:42.610
So if that element
isn't used, we

00:36:42.610 --> 00:36:46.090
could go in, take out a servo,
put it in somewhere else.

00:36:46.090 --> 00:36:48.580
And so we can treat that
as a spare, at least

00:36:48.580 --> 00:36:51.130
during the period where
that UAV isn't used.

00:36:51.130 --> 00:36:53.230
Does that make sense?

00:36:53.230 --> 00:36:56.650
OK, so the difference
then is that in the kind

00:36:56.650 --> 00:36:59.980
of classic way of doing it,
we have dedicated spares.

00:36:59.980 --> 00:37:04.300
Each element, one element
1, element i, element E,

00:37:04.300 --> 00:37:08.095
has dedicated spares that
only work on that vehicle.

00:37:11.050 --> 00:37:13.240
There's no swapping,
there's no scavenging,

00:37:13.240 --> 00:37:15.040
there's no communality.

00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:18.490
And therefore, your spares
repository, s sub i,

00:37:18.490 --> 00:37:20.290
is going to be pretty
big because there's

00:37:20.290 --> 00:37:22.550
no commonality, no sparing.

00:37:22.550 --> 00:37:27.520
In this new situation, you have
reconfigurable or common parts.

00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:29.950
So we still have a
spares repository.

00:37:29.950 --> 00:37:33.970
But now those spares can be
deployed across all or a subset

00:37:33.970 --> 00:37:37.190
of the elements,
plus we can treat--

00:37:37.190 --> 00:37:39.280
and this is this
dashed line here--

00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:44.840
we can treat elements that
are part of idle elements.

00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:47.060
We can treat them
temporarily as being

00:37:47.060 --> 00:37:49.070
part of the spares repository.

00:37:49.070 --> 00:37:51.140
Does that make sense?

00:37:51.140 --> 00:37:55.970
So that's a much more, in
a sense, smarter way to do.

00:37:55.970 --> 00:38:00.020
And the question is,
what's the benefit of this?

00:38:00.020 --> 00:38:05.750
So in order to calculate
the benefits for this,

00:38:05.750 --> 00:38:07.410
we essentially--

00:38:07.410 --> 00:38:08.660
we have some constraints.

00:38:08.660 --> 00:38:11.480
So for example, the number
of failures that you can have

00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:12.680
is between--

00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:14.570
if you have zero
failures, that's great.

00:38:14.570 --> 00:38:16.160
That's your lower floor.

00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:19.040
And then N is the
total number of units

00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:21.590
you have in your
architecture, including

00:38:21.590 --> 00:38:24.890
the ones in the inventory,
in the initial inventory,

00:38:24.890 --> 00:38:28.190
and plus the ones that are
built into all the vehicles.

00:38:28.190 --> 00:38:31.370
And then, the key here is what's
known as back-order level.

00:38:31.370 --> 00:38:36.260
So back-order essentially
is the number of spares

00:38:36.260 --> 00:38:40.130
that you would
need but may not--

00:38:40.130 --> 00:38:43.700
so when the back-order level
becomes larger than zero,

00:38:43.700 --> 00:38:47.690
it essentially means that
your number of failures

00:38:47.690 --> 00:38:51.620
have exceeded the number
of spares that you have.

00:38:51.620 --> 00:38:53.840
You don't have enough
spares to satisfy

00:38:53.840 --> 00:38:55.520
all your operational needs.

00:38:55.520 --> 00:39:00.920
So this is this conditional
back-order at spares level s.

00:39:00.920 --> 00:39:03.140
And you sum that
essentially then

00:39:03.140 --> 00:39:06.770
over all the possible failure
states that you could see.

00:39:06.770 --> 00:39:07.880
And why is that useful?

00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:10.250
Because you can then
calculate essentially

00:39:10.250 --> 00:39:12.120
your element availability.

00:39:12.120 --> 00:39:16.640
So a is your availability
of at time ti.

00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:19.610
And then your probability
of the whole system

00:39:19.610 --> 00:39:23.720
is the minimum of your system
availability at any time

00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:26.930
and point during your mission
horizon, your mission time,

00:39:26.930 --> 00:39:29.510
T. Do you see how that works?

00:39:29.510 --> 00:39:32.570
So you have your spares.

00:39:32.570 --> 00:39:36.230
You have failures of the
spares, which are random.

00:39:36.230 --> 00:39:37.880
And then you can
calculate, are you

00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:41.120
going to have enough spares to
operate every element that you

00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:45.410
need to operate when it's
supposed to be operational?

00:39:45.410 --> 00:39:50.090
And the back-order level, this
number b here, is what you use.

00:39:50.090 --> 00:39:52.950
You look at your back-order
level across the whole mission

00:39:52.950 --> 00:39:57.930
timeline to see what your
system availability will be.

00:39:57.930 --> 00:40:04.320
And there's a closed form
approximation of this.

00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:08.660
And then for a larger number
of elements and different QPAs

00:40:08.660 --> 00:40:11.790
and so forth, you typically then
have to switch to simulation,

00:40:11.790 --> 00:40:14.100
like Monte Carlo simulations.

00:40:14.100 --> 00:40:17.200
So what are the results here?

00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:19.320
So this was applied to--

00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:23.130
the example here is a
co-located mission elements.

00:40:23.130 --> 00:40:26.130
This is for, I think,
it was a lunar mission.

00:40:26.130 --> 00:40:30.430
And you define essentially
the operational time profile,

00:40:30.430 --> 00:40:32.590
quantity per application,
and so forth.

00:40:32.590 --> 00:40:35.520
And the example that was used
was an electronic control unit,

00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:40.560
and ECU, with a meantime to
failure of 100,000 hours.

00:40:40.560 --> 00:40:43.440
So failure rate is 1
over meantime to failure.

00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:46.020
Lambda is the
expected failure rate

00:40:46.020 --> 00:40:48.370
is 1 over meantime to failure.

00:40:48.370 --> 00:40:50.700
So pretty reliable,
100,000 hours

00:40:50.700 --> 00:40:55.590
of operation meantime to
failure is pretty reliable.

00:40:55.590 --> 00:40:57.850
But of course, you're
far from Earth.

00:40:57.850 --> 00:41:01.140
This is a 600-day
timeline, and you

00:41:01.140 --> 00:41:03.330
can see here the
operational profiles

00:41:03.330 --> 00:41:04.760
for your various
mission elements.

00:41:04.760 --> 00:41:07.590
So this is actually kind of
reminds you of The Martian,

00:41:07.590 --> 00:41:08.500
right?

00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:11.342
Anybody seen the movie
The Martian recently?

00:41:11.342 --> 00:41:12.300
Who's seen The Martian?

00:41:12.300 --> 00:41:15.030
Who's not seen The Martian?

00:41:15.030 --> 00:41:16.230
You've got to go.

00:41:16.230 --> 00:41:17.850
You're the only one in the room.

00:41:17.850 --> 00:41:19.080
It's a great movie.

00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:24.720
So he does scavenging
and even things

00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:26.830
that weren't supposed
to be scavenged.

00:41:26.830 --> 00:41:30.240
And so we have
four elements here.

00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:35.220
We have the PR, which is the
Pressurized Rover, the Habitat,

00:41:35.220 --> 00:41:39.780
the All-Terrain
Vehicle, and then

00:41:39.780 --> 00:41:42.660
the ATV, which is the
Ascent-Descent Vehicle.

00:41:42.660 --> 00:41:45.720
In this case, it's the same
vehicle for ascent and descent.

00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:47.850
And so the
Ascent-Descent Vehicle,

00:41:47.850 --> 00:41:51.000
you only need it when you
land and when you depart.

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:53.170
The rest of the
time it's dormant.

00:41:53.170 --> 00:41:55.470
The Habitat is used while
you're on the surface.

00:41:55.470 --> 00:41:57.840
The ATV is used while
you're on the surface.

00:41:57.840 --> 00:42:00.372
And then, the Pressurized
Rover is used--

00:42:00.372 --> 00:42:01.830
the assumption here
is you're going

00:42:01.830 --> 00:42:05.550
to operate for like 100
days very close to the base.

00:42:05.550 --> 00:42:07.470
And only after 100
days are you going

00:42:07.470 --> 00:42:11.490
to start going further away
with the Pressurized Rover.

00:42:11.490 --> 00:42:13.340
So those are the
operational profiles.

00:42:13.340 --> 00:42:14.140
Yeah?

00:42:14.140 --> 00:42:16.140
AUDIENCE: Is there an
argument that you wouldn't

00:42:16.140 --> 00:42:19.325
want to be scavenging parts
from your Ascent-Descent Vehicle

00:42:19.325 --> 00:42:20.490
at all?

00:42:20.490 --> 00:42:22.010
PROFESSOR: That's a good point.

00:42:22.010 --> 00:42:25.230
So if basically, your
back-order level is too high,

00:42:25.230 --> 00:42:28.020
and you run out of
your last spare the day

00:42:28.020 --> 00:42:32.280
before you're supposed to launch
on the ADV, you're in trouble.

00:42:32.280 --> 00:42:36.990
But if that's the case,
then what you have to do

00:42:36.990 --> 00:42:42.180
is you have to
exclude the minimum--

00:42:42.180 --> 00:42:45.150
and there may be redundancy
in that Ascent Vehicle.

00:42:45.150 --> 00:42:47.490
And you may or may not
be willing to sacrifice

00:42:47.490 --> 00:42:49.210
the redundancy.

00:42:49.210 --> 00:42:51.240
I mean, this is all
about risk, right?

00:42:51.240 --> 00:42:55.650
And exclude those or keep out
spares that you cannot touch

00:42:55.650 --> 00:42:59.520
because if you can't, then
you can't get back home.

00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:02.460
So you just don't count
those in your spares pool

00:43:02.460 --> 00:43:03.870
if that's the case.

00:43:03.870 --> 00:43:06.840
But you can still do
the whole analysis.

00:43:06.840 --> 00:43:10.250
OK, so what's the
bottom line here?

00:43:10.250 --> 00:43:12.660
What's the punch line here?

00:43:12.660 --> 00:43:18.953
So the punch line is
that if you have a--

00:43:18.953 --> 00:43:22.530
the D case here is the
dedicated case, OK?

00:43:22.530 --> 00:43:25.290
So this is where
there's no scavenging,

00:43:25.290 --> 00:43:28.200
there's no commonality of
spares among these elements.

00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:30.240
You have to have
dedicated spares.

00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:34.290
And let's assume you want
a 90% availability, which

00:43:34.290 --> 00:43:37.290
is not that high.

00:43:37.290 --> 00:43:40.480
That's a relatively
modest requirement.

00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:42.510
You want 90% availability.

00:43:42.510 --> 00:43:46.420
What it means is you need
to have in this case,

00:43:46.420 --> 00:43:49.860
you can see the
line just crosses

00:43:49.860 --> 00:43:51.910
below here, this crossover.

00:43:51.910 --> 00:43:56.340
You need four spares in
your initial spares pool

00:43:56.340 --> 00:43:58.530
for this electronic
control unit.

00:43:58.530 --> 00:44:02.190
You have to have at least
four spares, dedicated spares,

00:44:02.190 --> 00:44:06.320
for that electronic control
unit for a 600-day mission

00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:12.800
for a unit that has
100,000 MTTF or MTBF

00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:16.460
to guarantee at least
90% availability.

00:44:16.460 --> 00:44:18.240
And you say, oh,
that's not a big deal.

00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:19.400
That's just four spares.

00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:21.230
Well, that's just one unit.

00:44:21.230 --> 00:44:23.180
That's just one box, right?

00:44:23.180 --> 00:44:24.890
You probably have
dozens of boxes,

00:44:24.890 --> 00:44:27.920
or even hundreds across
all these elements.

00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:31.010
And so that could
be a lot of spares.

00:44:31.010 --> 00:44:35.300
You translate that to mass
and volume, that's a big deal.

00:44:35.300 --> 00:44:43.460
So using closed-form analytics
to calculate the minimum number

00:44:43.460 --> 00:44:45.770
of spares you need,
this is the R case,

00:44:45.770 --> 00:44:47.480
the reconfigurable case.

00:44:47.480 --> 00:44:50.840
You can see that you can
achieve that same requirement

00:44:50.840 --> 00:44:53.089
with two spares.

00:44:53.089 --> 00:44:53.630
You see that?

00:44:53.630 --> 00:44:55.950
That's this line here.

00:44:55.950 --> 00:44:58.700
It's this line here, and
this is a conservative model.

00:44:58.700 --> 00:45:00.590
This is a conservative model.

00:45:00.590 --> 00:45:05.930
So by doing reconfigurable and
common spares and scavenging,

00:45:05.930 --> 00:45:09.780
you can cut your number
of spares in half.

00:45:09.780 --> 00:45:11.490
You can cut your number
of spares in half

00:45:11.490 --> 00:45:15.560
and still achieve a 90%
system availability.

00:45:15.560 --> 00:45:18.320
And then you multiply that
across all the elements

00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:20.180
in your architecture.

00:45:20.180 --> 00:45:22.280
And that's a big deal.

00:45:22.280 --> 00:45:24.690
And then this result here--

00:45:24.690 --> 00:45:28.040
so this is a rigorous
bound because it

00:45:28.040 --> 00:45:29.780
makes some conservative
assumptions,

00:45:29.780 --> 00:45:32.780
and it uses closed-form
equations to calculate this.

00:45:32.780 --> 00:45:35.070
And the details
are in the paper.

00:45:35.070 --> 00:45:37.520
And then this curve
here is the simulated.

00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:41.660
So if you simulate this using
essentially a discrete event

00:45:41.660 --> 00:45:44.480
simulation several times,
and then you take averages,

00:45:44.480 --> 00:45:46.160
it's actually even
a little better.

00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:48.930
This suggests you could even
get away with one spare.

00:45:48.930 --> 00:45:55.080
But it's not as conservative
as the closed-form solution.

00:45:55.080 --> 00:45:57.530
OK, so the bottom line
is reconfigurable parts

00:45:57.530 --> 00:46:01.880
allow for 33% to 50% reduction
in the number of required

00:46:01.880 --> 00:46:05.280
spares for 90%
availability level.

00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:08.090
But if you think about what
that means operationally,

00:46:08.090 --> 00:46:10.490
it means that you really
have to know ahead

00:46:10.490 --> 00:46:13.400
of time what's going to be
operational when, you have

00:46:13.400 --> 00:46:16.910
to have the crew trained
to be able to actually go

00:46:16.910 --> 00:46:18.290
in and scavenge.

00:46:18.290 --> 00:46:20.000
And the equipment,
the vehicles, have

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:22.760
to be designed such that you
can actually remove this stuff

00:46:22.760 --> 00:46:25.470
and put it back in
relatively easily.

00:46:25.470 --> 00:46:28.370
So that would impose
some accessibility,

00:46:28.370 --> 00:46:32.180
and replaceability, and
maintainability requirements.

00:46:32.180 --> 00:46:34.854
The other option is you
say, we don't want spares.

00:46:34.854 --> 00:46:36.770
Well, then you need to
do a lot of redundancy.

00:46:36.770 --> 00:46:38.145
And then, your
vehicles are going

00:46:38.145 --> 00:46:39.547
to get heavy and more complex.

00:46:39.547 --> 00:46:41.380
I mean, those are the
real world trade-offs.

00:46:41.380 --> 00:46:42.950
Yup, Sam?

00:46:42.950 --> 00:46:45.050
AUDIENCE: Does this
potentially increase

00:46:45.050 --> 00:46:47.900
the risk for the
crew of the mission

00:46:47.900 --> 00:46:52.630
if there's some sort of inherent
failure in the particular part

00:46:52.630 --> 00:46:54.290
that is being used everywhere?

00:46:54.290 --> 00:46:57.670
PROFESSOR: So I don't know if
you looked ahead or you just--

00:46:57.670 --> 00:46:59.090
I know you're a smart guy, Sam.

00:46:59.090 --> 00:47:05.270
So this is the answer to
your question right here.

00:47:05.270 --> 00:47:11.360
So this is great.

00:47:11.360 --> 00:47:14.187
OK, we like the fact
that we can cut down

00:47:14.187 --> 00:47:15.770
on the number of
spares and still meet

00:47:15.770 --> 00:47:17.600
the same availability.

00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:20.540
But you can ask the
question in different ways.

00:47:20.540 --> 00:47:24.470
So on the left side is a
kind of sensitivity analysis

00:47:24.470 --> 00:47:28.110
that says, well, maybe we're
not so mass constrained.

00:47:28.110 --> 00:47:30.830
We have plenty of
transportation capacity.

00:47:30.830 --> 00:47:33.260
So we're not really
mass constrained.

00:47:33.260 --> 00:47:38.600
But we know that designing
ultra-reliable electronic boxes

00:47:38.600 --> 00:47:41.790
or whatever components
is very expensive, right?

00:47:41.790 --> 00:47:48.820
So can we decrease
the requirement

00:47:48.820 --> 00:47:50.740
on the manufacturer
of these boxes?

00:47:50.740 --> 00:47:56.230
And can we go from, say,
100,000 to 75,000 MTTF?

00:47:56.230 --> 00:48:00.290
So we're decreasing the nominal
reliability of the equipment

00:48:00.290 --> 00:48:02.080
by a fourth.

00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:05.980
We're making the job easier
for the supplier of that box.

00:48:05.980 --> 00:48:08.940
Presumably, that
should be cheaper.

00:48:08.940 --> 00:48:11.890
That should be a cheaper
box to design and build.

00:48:11.890 --> 00:48:15.370
So what will happen if we drop
the reliability requirement

00:48:15.370 --> 00:48:17.060
by 25%?

00:48:17.060 --> 00:48:19.000
And then you can
see the impact here.

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:21.280
So the blue curve
is essentially what

00:48:21.280 --> 00:48:24.340
you get for the less
reliable equipment.

00:48:24.340 --> 00:48:28.920
And then the black
was the original.

00:48:28.920 --> 00:48:31.830
So now, Sam's question.

00:48:31.830 --> 00:48:36.490
So this is basically-- so
here's your failure rate.

00:48:36.490 --> 00:48:39.640
OK, this is your failure
rate, 10 to the minus 3.

00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:42.644
And we're varying the failure
rate over a large range.

00:48:42.644 --> 00:48:44.560
And then we're looking
at system availability.

00:48:44.560 --> 00:48:47.890
This is for a fixed
number of spares.

00:48:47.890 --> 00:48:54.690
And what's really interesting--
so when your failure rate is

00:48:54.690 --> 00:48:55.560
low--

00:48:55.560 --> 00:48:59.400
so we're on the left side--

00:48:59.400 --> 00:49:01.800
then the blue curve is
lower, the dedicated case.

00:49:01.800 --> 00:49:05.760
So for a fixed number of
spares, for relatively reliable

00:49:05.760 --> 00:49:09.330
equipment, you're better off
going with the reconfigurable

00:49:09.330 --> 00:49:10.155
or common spares.

00:49:13.270 --> 00:49:15.910
This is logarithmic, so
it's a little tricky.

00:49:15.910 --> 00:49:18.360
So system availability
is higher when

00:49:18.360 --> 00:49:21.970
you have common and
reconfigurable spares,

00:49:21.970 --> 00:49:25.250
relatively reliable equipment.

00:49:25.250 --> 00:49:26.780
But there's a crossover point.

00:49:26.780 --> 00:49:30.920
If your boxes, your
elements, your components,

00:49:30.920 --> 00:49:33.740
are very unreliable, which
is on the right side,

00:49:33.740 --> 00:49:36.090
there's actually
a crossover point.

00:49:36.090 --> 00:49:39.140
And the idea is that,
well, now because it's

00:49:39.140 --> 00:49:41.960
common and reconfigurable
across all the vehicles,

00:49:41.960 --> 00:49:45.560
you have this really bad box
that breaks all the time.

00:49:45.560 --> 00:49:47.810
Now, the problem is everywhere.

00:49:47.810 --> 00:49:49.970
Every vehicle, everything
is affected by it.

00:49:49.970 --> 00:49:53.930
Whereas before, it was kind
of more contained, right?

00:49:53.930 --> 00:49:56.210
And so that's what
that crossover is.

00:49:56.210 --> 00:50:00.080
So if you're in a situation
with very unreliable equipment,

00:50:00.080 --> 00:50:02.240
unreliable components,
you're actually

00:50:02.240 --> 00:50:06.110
worse off making them
common or reconfigurable.

00:50:06.110 --> 00:50:10.400
And you can now calculate
where that crossover point is.

00:50:10.400 --> 00:50:12.860
That's pretty cool,
don't you think?

00:50:12.860 --> 00:50:15.170
I get excited about this stuff.

00:50:15.170 --> 00:50:17.960
I don't know about you
guys, but this is real.

00:50:17.960 --> 00:50:21.290
This is what you care--
in operations, this is--

00:50:21.290 --> 00:50:23.810
how many spares of
each kind, can we

00:50:23.810 --> 00:50:26.660
guarantee that we
can successfully

00:50:26.660 --> 00:50:29.600
do this campaign, whether
it's a military campaign,

00:50:29.600 --> 00:50:31.580
or you go to Antarctica.

00:50:31.580 --> 00:50:33.830
And we heard about
the Octanus Rover.

00:50:33.830 --> 00:50:36.159
And it's just one
Rover, but what's

00:50:36.159 --> 00:50:38.450
all this stuff that you need
to bring with you in terms

00:50:38.450 --> 00:50:40.700
of spares to make
sure you can actually

00:50:40.700 --> 00:50:44.740
have a successful campaign
and have a guarantee of that?

00:50:44.740 --> 00:50:46.550
Yeah?

00:50:46.550 --> 00:50:50.390
AUDIENCE: I'm wondering if the
reconfigurability argument also

00:50:50.390 --> 00:50:53.930
has some sort of impact
on the kind of finances

00:50:53.930 --> 00:50:55.820
and manufacturability--
in terms of if you're

00:50:55.820 --> 00:50:58.460
making reconfigurable
parts for different things,

00:50:58.460 --> 00:51:01.220
they may be more
similarly manufactured,

00:51:01.220 --> 00:51:04.820
and therefore may represent
a decrease in cost

00:51:04.820 --> 00:51:05.960
on the manufacturing side?

00:51:05.960 --> 00:51:08.030
If that's another motivation.

00:51:08.030 --> 00:51:09.750
PROFESSOR: That's a great point.

00:51:09.750 --> 00:51:11.930
What I will say
about that is that

00:51:11.930 --> 00:51:13.550
in order to capture
that benefit,

00:51:13.550 --> 00:51:15.860
you need to lock that
in contractually.

00:51:15.860 --> 00:51:19.370
So either you give all this
work to the same manufacturer

00:51:19.370 --> 00:51:24.170
and say, OK, you're now making
50 boxes instead of just five.

00:51:24.170 --> 00:51:28.430
There has to be a discount
on a per-unit basis for that.

00:51:28.430 --> 00:51:30.140
Or if it's different
manufacturers,

00:51:30.140 --> 00:51:31.640
then it gets hard.

00:51:31.640 --> 00:51:35.750
So yes, but you have to have the
kind of business arrangements

00:51:35.750 --> 00:51:38.530
that will allow you
to capture that value.

00:51:38.530 --> 00:51:41.840
EPFL-- were you
able to follow this?

00:51:41.840 --> 00:51:43.730
I know this is pretty
detailed discussion

00:51:43.730 --> 00:51:45.200
here on these curves.

00:51:45.200 --> 00:51:49.140
Is it-- Maxim, you're
sort of shaking your head.

00:51:49.140 --> 00:51:50.140
Is it clear?

00:51:53.510 --> 00:51:55.360
GUEST SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE]--

00:51:55.360 --> 00:51:58.030
I can give you a concrete
practical about everyday life

00:51:58.030 --> 00:52:03.405
example that you probably know
about in this particular view

00:52:03.405 --> 00:52:04.540
of [INAUDIBLE].

00:52:04.540 --> 00:52:09.180
But imagine you go with your
car on vacation for two weeks,

00:52:09.180 --> 00:52:14.230
and your children all
need Pampers [INAUDIBLE]..

00:52:14.230 --> 00:52:16.350
And you can take them
with you from your store.

00:52:16.350 --> 00:52:17.516
Well, you know how they are.

00:52:17.516 --> 00:52:19.824
They are more
expensive but reliable.

00:52:19.824 --> 00:52:21.990
But you don't know how many
you're going to consume.

00:52:21.990 --> 00:52:24.450
But you get a certain
minimum amount per day,

00:52:24.450 --> 00:52:26.940
and you hope you don't
go over the limit.

00:52:26.940 --> 00:52:28.200
Now, it takes lots of volume.

00:52:28.200 --> 00:52:30.690
So you have to trade off
your space because you

00:52:30.690 --> 00:52:32.480
have fixed space in your car.

00:52:32.480 --> 00:52:35.970
You cannot take more than
the volume available.

00:52:35.970 --> 00:52:39.665
And so this is exactly the kind
of reliability curve you have.

00:52:39.665 --> 00:52:41.040
You can take too
little with you.

00:52:41.040 --> 00:52:43.780
You have to buy the wrong
stuff when you get there,

00:52:43.780 --> 00:52:44.810
wherever you are.

00:52:44.810 --> 00:52:49.414
And then it might have leaks
and failures and not worth it.

00:52:49.414 --> 00:52:52.160
So you'll need more than
what you thought initially

00:52:52.160 --> 00:52:53.752
and cost more as well.

00:52:53.752 --> 00:52:56.225
So actually, this is extremely
important in everyday life.

00:52:56.225 --> 00:52:59.230
PROFESSOR: OK, so I like your--

00:52:59.230 --> 00:53:01.844
I'm past that stage with
my kids several years.

00:53:01.844 --> 00:53:02.760
GUEST SPEAKER: Me too.

00:53:02.760 --> 00:53:04.740
PROFESSOR: But I'm going
to amend your example

00:53:04.740 --> 00:53:06.240
in the following way.

00:53:06.240 --> 00:53:09.300
Basically, if you had two kids,
and they're very different,

00:53:09.300 --> 00:53:12.930
like one is really tall, and
their same diapers will not

00:53:12.930 --> 00:53:15.690
fit, then you have
a problem, right?

00:53:15.690 --> 00:53:19.260
But if they're twins, or if you
buy stretchable diapers that

00:53:19.260 --> 00:53:22.650
have a huge range, then
you can cut down, right?

00:53:22.650 --> 00:53:26.380
So you have to have like
different kids in the car.

00:53:26.380 --> 00:53:27.720
Then it works.

00:53:27.720 --> 00:53:30.200
I think then the example works.

00:53:30.200 --> 00:53:31.650
OK, let's see.

00:53:31.650 --> 00:53:33.570
We're kind of running
short on time.

00:53:33.570 --> 00:53:34.920
So one more example.

00:53:34.920 --> 00:53:39.120
This is based on the doctoral
thesis of Jeremy [? Oktay. ?]

00:53:39.120 --> 00:53:42.030
He's a flight test engineer.

00:53:42.030 --> 00:53:44.430
And the question
that he looked at

00:53:44.430 --> 00:53:47.430
was robustness of
degraded airplanes.

00:53:47.430 --> 00:53:51.150
So the idea here is
that some systems

00:53:51.150 --> 00:53:54.450
are going to be used longer
in long, ultra-endurance kind

00:53:54.450 --> 00:53:58.950
of systems where you do not
have the option of repair.

00:53:58.950 --> 00:54:02.790
You don't have the option
to land, repair, and fix

00:54:02.790 --> 00:54:05.940
the system, and bring
it back to its pristine

00:54:05.940 --> 00:54:08.190
everything-is-working state.

00:54:08.190 --> 00:54:11.190
And on the right side here, you
see some examples of-- these

00:54:11.190 --> 00:54:13.524
are real systems that
people have worked on,

00:54:13.524 --> 00:54:14.940
or are working on,
or are thinking

00:54:14.940 --> 00:54:16.830
about that have this situation.

00:54:16.830 --> 00:54:21.450
The DARPA Vulture is a program
where a UAV would stay aloft

00:54:21.450 --> 00:54:25.080
for five years with no
landing and a repair allowed.

00:54:25.080 --> 00:54:27.450
So you can obviously see
it's got solar panels,

00:54:27.450 --> 00:54:31.860
and I think it has fuel cells
as well, if I'm not mistaken.

00:54:31.860 --> 00:54:34.440
So how do you achieve that?

00:54:34.440 --> 00:54:39.000
This is an example from
Antarctica flying several UAVs

00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:40.770
to map the ice sheets.

00:54:40.770 --> 00:54:44.280
This was a gap solution
while the iSat satellite

00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:47.790
between iSat I and iSat II.

00:54:47.790 --> 00:54:52.170
And then here's a human
colony maybe on the moon

00:54:52.170 --> 00:54:54.510
or looks like the moon.

00:54:54.510 --> 00:54:56.010
So we have this dome here.

00:54:56.010 --> 00:54:57.900
This crater has been
covered with a dome,

00:54:57.900 --> 00:55:00.090
and we have a greenhouse inside.

00:55:00.090 --> 00:55:02.010
So life support
systems that have

00:55:02.010 --> 00:55:05.470
to be super reliable for a
very long amount of time.

00:55:05.470 --> 00:55:08.940
And so the question
that Jeremy looked at

00:55:08.940 --> 00:55:11.040
is, how do we
design and optimize

00:55:11.040 --> 00:55:14.730
systems that have ultra-long
endurance, where you know ahead

00:55:14.730 --> 00:55:18.610
of time that
failures will occur?

00:55:18.610 --> 00:55:22.060
Failures will occur, and you
can't repair the failures

00:55:22.060 --> 00:55:23.080
easily.

00:55:23.080 --> 00:55:25.540
So you have to design
the system apriori,

00:55:25.540 --> 00:55:29.050
such that in those
partially-failed states,

00:55:29.050 --> 00:55:31.980
it will give you the
maximum residual performance

00:55:31.980 --> 00:55:34.060
that it possibly could.

00:55:34.060 --> 00:55:37.150
And it turns out, when that's
your objective function,

00:55:37.150 --> 00:55:39.340
you design the
systems differently

00:55:39.340 --> 00:55:41.830
than if you just optimize
nominal performance

00:55:41.830 --> 00:55:47.470
and then worry about what
happens if there's failures.

00:55:47.470 --> 00:55:51.220
And this is the second paper
that I uploaded for you.

00:55:51.220 --> 00:55:55.480
So both of these papers
"The Reconfigurable Spares"

00:55:55.480 --> 00:55:58.810
and then this one are uploaded
both on Moodle and Stellar

00:55:58.810 --> 00:56:00.640
if you want to
take a deeper look.

00:56:00.640 --> 00:56:03.310
So the case study
here is the C-12--

00:56:03.310 --> 00:56:05.350
this is the King Air airplane.

00:56:05.350 --> 00:56:08.210
This is the military
version of it

00:56:08.210 --> 00:56:12.430
and typically flies out
of Edwards Air Force base.

00:56:12.430 --> 00:56:15.480
And the idea is that there
can be different failures

00:56:15.480 --> 00:56:16.320
on this airplane.

00:56:16.320 --> 00:56:20.790
So this diagram, this is
a so-called Markov chain

00:56:20.790 --> 00:56:22.860
where n means nominal.

00:56:22.860 --> 00:56:24.940
And you can see the table
that goes with this.

00:56:24.940 --> 00:56:27.840
Nominal means
nothing has failed,

00:56:27.840 --> 00:56:29.460
and you just do turn control.

00:56:29.460 --> 00:56:33.120
This is climbing,
left-turn climbing.

00:56:33.120 --> 00:56:35.160
You just turn control
with your ailerons,

00:56:35.160 --> 00:56:37.350
which is just standard flying.

00:56:37.350 --> 00:56:39.030
And then different
failures could

00:56:39.030 --> 00:56:40.430
occur of different elements.

00:56:40.430 --> 00:56:44.070
So the left engine, the rudder,
and the aileron could fail.

00:56:44.070 --> 00:56:45.540
Of course, a lot more can fail.

00:56:45.540 --> 00:56:47.760
But in this case study,
those are the elements

00:56:47.760 --> 00:56:50.060
that are allowed to fail.

00:56:50.060 --> 00:56:53.340
And so 1 means the
left engine has failed,

00:56:53.340 --> 00:56:56.250
2 means the rudder
has failed, and 3

00:56:56.250 --> 00:56:58.950
means the ailerons have failed.

00:56:58.950 --> 00:57:02.340
And then as you move to the
right, it gets worse and worse.

00:57:02.340 --> 00:57:07.050
So state 4 means you lost your
left engine and the aileron,

00:57:07.050 --> 00:57:09.060
but you still have your rudder.

00:57:09.060 --> 00:57:12.300
And then, the worst is state
7, where everything's failed.

00:57:12.300 --> 00:57:14.250
The left engine's
failed, the rudder,

00:57:14.250 --> 00:57:16.110
and the aileron has failed.

00:57:16.110 --> 00:57:20.070
And what you worry about is
what we call availability.

00:57:20.070 --> 00:57:24.300
Expected availability is what's
the probability or fraction

00:57:24.300 --> 00:57:26.430
of probability that
the system will

00:57:26.430 --> 00:57:30.210
perform above some minimum
threshold, which in this case

00:57:30.210 --> 00:57:31.800
we call WM.

00:57:31.800 --> 00:57:35.310
And then expected performance
is the probability of each

00:57:35.310 --> 00:57:38.670
of these failure states
multiplied by the performance

00:57:38.670 --> 00:57:42.280
that you're still getting
in that failure state, OK?

00:57:42.280 --> 00:57:45.610
And what was done
here is to say, OK,

00:57:45.610 --> 00:57:47.670
we know what the
C-12 airplane looks

00:57:47.670 --> 00:57:49.590
like the way it exists today.

00:57:49.590 --> 00:57:51.090
But what if that
airplane had been

00:57:51.090 --> 00:57:53.400
designed slightly differently?

00:57:53.400 --> 00:57:55.620
Low value and high value
around the baseline,

00:57:55.620 --> 00:57:57.765
a little bit bigger
wing, bigger tail--

00:58:00.690 --> 00:58:02.670
how would it impact the
performance, not just

00:58:02.670 --> 00:58:06.330
the nominal, but the off-nominal
performance in these failed

00:58:06.330 --> 00:58:07.770
states?

00:58:07.770 --> 00:58:12.300
So just to show you why this
is interesting or relevant--

00:58:12.300 --> 00:58:15.180
I picked out the most
interesting failure

00:58:15.180 --> 00:58:17.430
states are the
intermediate ones here,

00:58:17.430 --> 00:58:19.500
these partially-failed states.

00:58:19.500 --> 00:58:21.750
And so on this
picture, you can see

00:58:21.750 --> 00:58:24.330
in red what's failed
on the aircraft,

00:58:24.330 --> 00:58:29.280
and then plotting bank angle
versus specific excess power,

00:58:29.280 --> 00:58:30.660
which is essentially
your ability

00:58:30.660 --> 00:58:32.850
to climb in feet per minute.

00:58:32.850 --> 00:58:36.060
And this is all calculated
through a simulator,

00:58:36.060 --> 00:58:39.150
a pretty accurate six degree
of freedom simulator, where

00:58:39.150 --> 00:58:41.460
you can actually
modify the airplane.

00:58:41.460 --> 00:58:43.860
It's a very cool
open-source simulator

00:58:43.860 --> 00:58:48.210
that Jeremy modified where you
can actually fly the airplane

00:58:48.210 --> 00:58:52.290
simulated, and you can change
the plane during flight.

00:58:52.290 --> 00:58:56.000
Like you could grow
the wings as the plane

00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:59.100
is flying-- like morphing
wings and things like this.

00:58:59.100 --> 00:59:02.880
And of course here, you
fail parts of the airplane

00:59:02.880 --> 00:59:03.660
during flight.

00:59:03.660 --> 00:59:07.230
And then, the flight dynamics
are automatically the physics,

00:59:07.230 --> 00:59:10.500
automatically you have to
adjust to that failure.

00:59:10.500 --> 00:59:13.290
So this is not like
spreadsheet-type analysis,

00:59:13.290 --> 00:59:15.240
just so you know.

00:59:15.240 --> 00:59:18.390
So if you're inside
the safe region here,

00:59:18.390 --> 00:59:22.890
then you can keep the
bank angle between--

00:59:22.890 --> 00:59:26.070
we defined it between
25 and 35 degrees--

00:59:26.070 --> 00:59:29.010
and you have positive
rate of climb.

00:59:29.010 --> 00:59:31.350
Then you're still
in the safe region.

00:59:31.350 --> 00:59:35.130
And each of these points here
is a slightly tweaked version

00:59:35.130 --> 00:59:37.740
of the baseline airplane.

00:59:37.740 --> 00:59:42.270
So what's interesting here
is in some of these states,

00:59:42.270 --> 00:59:44.430
you're outside of
the safe region.

00:59:44.430 --> 00:59:48.270
So a small difference in the
design of the nominal airplane

00:59:48.270 --> 00:59:51.540
will mean the difference
between losing the plane

00:59:51.540 --> 00:59:53.310
or still being able to fly.

00:59:53.310 --> 00:59:55.785
So these points
that are out here,

00:59:55.785 --> 00:59:57.660
these are the interesting
points because they

00:59:57.660 --> 01:00:00.570
fall outside the safe region.

01:00:00.570 --> 01:00:03.240
And the points inside are
inside the safe region.

01:00:03.240 --> 01:00:06.600
Everything is the same
except the airplane geometry

01:00:06.600 --> 01:00:07.350
has been tweaked.

01:00:10.740 --> 01:00:13.360
And then of course, state
7 everything has failed.

01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:14.400
You lose the airplane.

01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:16.200
There's no way to
recover the airplane.

01:00:16.200 --> 01:00:18.160
So in some cases,
it's very clean.

01:00:18.160 --> 01:00:20.160
It's very clear
what will happen.

01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:22.770
And these intermediate
failure states

01:00:22.770 --> 01:00:25.770
are the interesting ones
because small changes

01:00:25.770 --> 01:00:29.370
in the upfront design make
a big difference in how

01:00:29.370 --> 01:00:32.910
the airplane will perform in
a partially-degraded state

01:00:32.910 --> 01:00:34.920
or partially-failed state.

01:00:34.920 --> 01:00:36.450
So the other thing
you can do then

01:00:36.450 --> 01:00:39.820
is you can do a sensitivity
analysis and say, well,

01:00:39.820 --> 01:00:43.680
how sensitive is, for
example, expected performance

01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:46.800
to the various design
variables in the airplane?

01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:50.640
Like rudder cord, and I'll
talk about vertical tail here,

01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:53.170
and the engine failure
rate, and so forth.

01:00:53.170 --> 01:00:56.460
And the difference between
the yellow and the green

01:00:56.460 --> 01:00:59.280
is yellow is an
eight-hour mission.

01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:01.080
So this is a typical
eight-hour mission.

01:01:01.080 --> 01:01:02.550
You fly, you come back.

01:01:02.550 --> 01:01:05.100
And if something's failed,
you just repair it.

01:01:05.100 --> 01:01:08.700
In the 20,000 mission,
20,000-hour mission,

01:01:08.700 --> 01:01:11.320
you can't come back and repair.

01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:14.280
So what you see
here is interesting.

01:01:14.280 --> 01:01:21.870
It means the sensitivity of
performance to these design

01:01:21.870 --> 01:01:26.320
decisions depends on how long
you will operate the system.

01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:28.710
And because the longer you
operate it, the more likely

01:01:28.710 --> 01:01:32.310
is that it will see these
partial failure modes, which

01:01:32.310 --> 01:01:35.190
will then influence the degraded
or the residual performance

01:01:35.190 --> 01:01:36.780
of the airplane.

01:01:36.780 --> 01:01:39.360
And the most interesting
parameter here,

01:01:39.360 --> 01:01:43.680
if you just look at this diagram
beside the engine failure

01:01:43.680 --> 01:01:47.970
rate-- so the engine failure
rate matters a lot when you fly

01:01:47.970 --> 01:01:49.740
a 20,000-hour mission.

01:01:49.740 --> 01:01:52.260
But if you look at the
cross these parameters,

01:01:52.260 --> 01:01:56.620
which one of these is
the most interesting?

01:01:56.620 --> 01:02:01.660
Which one of these is the
most interesting parameter?

01:02:01.660 --> 01:02:02.620
Let's see at EPFL.

01:02:02.620 --> 01:02:04.340
Can you see this diagram?

01:02:04.340 --> 01:02:07.356
Which one of these parameters
is the most interesting?

01:02:14.170 --> 01:02:15.464
Go ahead.

01:02:15.464 --> 01:02:16.630
AUDIENCE: The vertical tail?

01:02:16.630 --> 01:02:17.620
PROFESSOR: Why?

01:02:17.620 --> 01:02:20.290
AUDIENCE: Because it
has different behavior

01:02:20.290 --> 01:02:22.960
for the lifecycle and just
for the single mission.

01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:24.010
PROFESSOR: Yes.

01:02:24.010 --> 01:02:27.580
So if you're only going to
fly short missions with it

01:02:27.580 --> 01:02:29.410
and then land and
repair, you see

01:02:29.410 --> 01:02:32.410
the sensitivity is off
to the left, slightly

01:02:32.410 --> 01:02:34.330
negative sensitivity.

01:02:34.330 --> 01:02:37.330
So you could actually make
it just a little bit smaller.

01:02:37.330 --> 01:02:38.890
But if you're going
to fly very long,

01:02:38.890 --> 01:02:41.110
you should actually
make it bigger.

01:02:41.110 --> 01:02:46.320
And this particular airplane
has an undersized vertical tail.

01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:49.390
It has a Dutch roll
mode, where it has a yaw

01:02:49.390 --> 01:02:51.710
damper that was added later.

01:02:51.710 --> 01:02:58.180
And so if you're going to
fly for a long time period,

01:02:58.180 --> 01:03:00.820
you're going to see a failure
mode that will then exasperate

01:03:00.820 --> 01:03:02.050
that particular failure mode.

01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:08.770
So what it means is that if
you're actually going to design

01:03:08.770 --> 01:03:14.770
this airplane for a 20,000-hour
mission that you would design

01:03:14.770 --> 01:03:17.590
a much larger vertical
tail which penalizes you

01:03:17.590 --> 01:03:19.960
in the nominal.

01:03:19.960 --> 01:03:22.600
It penalizes you in
nominal operations,

01:03:22.600 --> 01:03:28.206
but it will benefit you in
these partially-failed states.

01:03:28.206 --> 01:03:29.580
Does that make
sense to you guys?

01:03:29.580 --> 01:03:32.430
You guys were
laughing, or smiling,

01:03:32.430 --> 01:03:33.610
or thinking about this.

01:03:33.610 --> 01:03:34.140
AUDIENCE: Yeah, it does.

01:03:34.140 --> 01:03:35.931
PROFESSOR: So have you
flown this airplane?

01:03:35.931 --> 01:03:37.590
Or do you have experience in it?

01:03:37.590 --> 01:03:39.180
AUDIENCE: We did a
flight test course,

01:03:39.180 --> 01:03:42.330
and we tested that troll.

01:03:42.330 --> 01:03:46.685
PROFESSOR: OK, so this brought
up some fuzzy memories or--

01:03:46.685 --> 01:03:47.310
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:03:47.310 --> 01:03:48.960
PROFESSOR: I mean, it's
basically the wing tip

01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:50.252
does like a figure eight.

01:03:50.252 --> 01:03:51.210
That's sort of classic.

01:03:51.210 --> 01:03:51.876
AUDIENCE: Right.

01:03:51.876 --> 01:03:54.330
PROFESSOR: That's the classic
manifestation of Dutch roll.

01:03:54.330 --> 01:03:55.390
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:03:55.390 --> 01:03:57.270
PROFESSOR: But if the
Dutch roll is too big,

01:03:57.270 --> 01:03:58.870
you can actually
lose the airplane.

01:03:58.870 --> 01:04:00.720
You can induce an instability.

01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:01.975
So this is a big deal.

01:04:01.975 --> 01:04:02.951
Yeah?

01:04:02.951 --> 01:04:04.950
AUDIENCE: Would that mean
that the vertical tail

01:04:04.950 --> 01:04:06.600
is sized properly then?

01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:09.109
Because you can make it
smaller and get a little better

01:04:09.109 --> 01:04:11.400
in this area, or make it
bigger and get a little better

01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:11.850
in this area.

01:04:11.850 --> 01:04:13.710
Because It seems like the
vertical, like, other things--

01:04:13.710 --> 01:04:15.630
PROFESSOR: It's fine
with the yaw damper.

01:04:15.630 --> 01:04:17.070
It's fine with the yaw damper.

01:04:17.070 --> 01:04:21.910
But actually, there has
been an airplane lost.

01:04:21.910 --> 01:04:24.510
There has been an
airplane lost in flight.

01:04:24.510 --> 01:04:27.060
And the accident
investigation showed

01:04:27.060 --> 01:04:32.790
that it was basically a Dutch
roll mode that became unstable.

01:04:32.790 --> 01:04:36.300
And so the point here is,
if you have a failure,

01:04:36.300 --> 01:04:38.820
then you're in trouble with
the small vertical tail.

01:04:38.820 --> 01:04:42.440
But if you don't have a failure,
then you're probably OK.

01:04:42.440 --> 01:04:45.110
And that's the whole point
of me showing you this--

01:04:45.110 --> 01:04:50.660
is to make the point that if you
are going to deal with a system

01:04:50.660 --> 01:04:53.660
or operate a system that is
going to have a very long

01:04:53.660 --> 01:04:56.360
operational life,
long endurance,

01:04:56.360 --> 01:05:01.140
without the possibility to land,
repair, and send it back out--

01:05:01.140 --> 01:05:04.430
so it's going to be perfect
and pristine on day one.

01:05:04.430 --> 01:05:06.320
And then gradually,
stuff will fail,

01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:09.830
and that's the case for
infrastructure, bridges,

01:05:09.830 --> 01:05:14.360
spacecraft past Neptune,
airplanes that are going

01:05:14.360 --> 01:05:16.910
to be aloft for five years.

01:05:16.910 --> 01:05:19.550
You just have to design
them differently.

01:05:19.550 --> 01:05:21.950
You just have to design-- and
this is hard for engineers

01:05:21.950 --> 01:05:27.280
to think about-- that I'm
actually designing for failure.

01:05:27.280 --> 01:05:29.770
I am designing a
system expecting

01:05:29.770 --> 01:05:33.800
that it will partially fail, not
completely, but partially fail.

01:05:33.800 --> 01:05:38.060
And by taking that into account,
the design looks different.

01:05:38.060 --> 01:05:40.640
This is kind of
non-conventional.

01:05:40.640 --> 01:05:43.010
OK, final thing,
post-flight review--

01:05:43.010 --> 01:05:46.130
what happens at the post-flight
or post-launch review?

01:05:46.130 --> 01:05:48.080
PLR, PFR.

01:05:48.080 --> 01:05:51.620
So essentially, what you do
is you review the telemetry

01:05:51.620 --> 01:05:52.830
from flight.

01:05:52.830 --> 01:05:54.530
You compare against
your predictions.

01:05:54.530 --> 01:05:56.480
You find repair any failures.

01:05:56.480 --> 01:05:58.940
You secure the
data for later use.

01:05:58.940 --> 01:06:01.370
And then you initiate the
detailed commissioning and

01:06:01.370 --> 01:06:03.380
hand-over to Operations.

01:06:03.380 --> 01:06:07.400
And here's a detailed list of
entrance and success criteria

01:06:07.400 --> 01:06:09.200
for post-flight review.

01:06:09.200 --> 01:06:12.170
And I put this up here because
those of you that will actually

01:06:12.170 --> 01:06:16.610
go to the CanSat competition,
this is part of the package.

01:06:16.610 --> 01:06:20.690
You are expected to launch
your payload, do the flight,

01:06:20.690 --> 01:06:24.470
and if something goes wrong, you
can maybe have a backup flight.

01:06:24.470 --> 01:06:27.890
And then after the flight,
you do a post-flight review.

01:06:27.890 --> 01:06:31.520
And good post-flight
reviews are planned ahead.

01:06:31.520 --> 01:06:34.586
You already know what data
you're going to analyze,

01:06:34.586 --> 01:06:35.960
if you already
have your software

01:06:35.960 --> 01:06:38.900
ready to suck in the
data after the flight

01:06:38.900 --> 01:06:42.460
and really get
insights out of it.

01:06:42.460 --> 01:06:45.430
Summary here-- this is
just kind of a checklist

01:06:45.430 --> 01:06:48.700
for thinking about operations.

01:06:48.700 --> 01:06:50.920
System check-out and
the lab, hangar, field--

01:06:50.920 --> 01:06:52.300
is everything working OK?

01:06:52.300 --> 01:06:55.630
Bring sufficient consumables,
spare parts, tools,

01:06:55.630 --> 01:06:59.800
support equipment, remote
control, telemetry, cameras.

01:06:59.800 --> 01:07:03.010
Train the operators
and support personnel.

01:07:03.010 --> 01:07:04.930
Checklists for
nominal operations

01:07:04.930 --> 01:07:07.960
and routine emergency
and contingencies.

01:07:07.960 --> 01:07:10.360
Think about your
transportation logistics

01:07:10.360 --> 01:07:13.360
and plan enough time for a
ramp-up for commissioning

01:07:13.360 --> 01:07:15.810
before operations.

01:07:15.810 --> 01:07:19.210
OK, so that was all I
wanted to cover today.

01:07:19.210 --> 01:07:22.730
Any questions about
commissioning and operations?

01:07:22.730 --> 01:07:25.250
My main point in
this lecture today

01:07:25.250 --> 01:07:29.600
was to kind of get you
excited about operations

01:07:29.600 --> 01:07:32.960
and to highlight that
there's a lot here.

01:07:32.960 --> 01:07:34.970
System engineers are not done.

01:07:34.970 --> 01:07:38.600
After CDR or PDR, you
say, oh, I did my job

01:07:38.600 --> 01:07:39.650
as a system engineer.

01:07:39.650 --> 01:07:41.580
It's up to you
guys, the operators.

01:07:41.580 --> 01:07:47.480
No, no, this is territory for
system engineering as well.

01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:52.650
And in the end, you just have
to get operational experience.

01:07:52.650 --> 01:07:54.650
There's no substitute
for actually being out

01:07:54.650 --> 01:08:01.160
in the field operating systems
and getting that experience.

01:08:01.160 --> 01:08:05.210
Any questions or
comments about this?

01:08:05.210 --> 01:08:09.230
OK, so a quick reminder,
a quick reminder,

01:08:09.230 --> 01:08:11.390
we're going to have our PDR.

01:08:11.390 --> 01:08:12.410
You saw the schedule.

01:08:12.410 --> 01:08:15.380
Monday, Tuesday,
Wednesday, please log

01:08:15.380 --> 01:08:16.910
in five minutes before.

01:08:16.910 --> 01:08:20.000
We're going to be using
my WebEx Personal Room.

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:21.260
The link is here.

01:08:21.260 --> 01:08:22.700
Upload your slide deck.

01:08:22.700 --> 01:08:24.590
30 minutes presentation,
and then we

01:08:24.590 --> 01:08:28.790
have up to 30 minutes
of Q&A. All right?

01:08:28.790 --> 01:08:30.640
Questions?

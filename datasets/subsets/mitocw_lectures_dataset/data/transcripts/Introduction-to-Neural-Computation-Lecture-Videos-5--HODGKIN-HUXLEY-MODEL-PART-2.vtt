WEBVTT

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.910
MICHALE FEE: Today we're
going to continue developing

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.020
our equivalent circuit model,
the Hodgkin-Huxley model

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.610
of a neuron.

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:25.830
And we're still focusing
on the mechanism

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.450
that generates spikes.

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:30.750
As you recall, there
are two conductances,

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.260
iron conductances, that lead
to action potential generation.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.080
There is sodium
conductance that is

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.400
connected to a sodium battery
that has a high equilibrium

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.320
potential.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.310
There is a potassium
conductance that

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:50.250
is connected to a
potassium battery that

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.070
has a negative
equilibrium potential,

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.990
and those two
conductances together

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:56.640
have voltage and
time dependence that

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.850
lead to the generation
of a positive going,

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.540
followed by a negative going,
fluctuation in the voltage that

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:04.950
is the action potential.

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:08.520
And as you recall,
the way that happens,

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.940
there is a time dependence
to these conductances

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.650
so that when the sodium
conductance turns on,

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.170
this resistor gets really
small, and basically connects

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.870
the inside of the cell
to that positive battery.

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:20.600
When the sodium
conductance turns off

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.400
and the potassium
conductance turns on,

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.010
we're disconnecting
the sodium battery

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:28.060
and connecting the
potassium battery,

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:29.550
which has a negative voltage.

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.440
And the voltage
of the cell, then,

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.370
is driven toward the negative
potassium equilibrium

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:37.700
potential.

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.130
So last time we worked out the
voltage and time dependence

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.320
of the potassium conductance.

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:49.000
Today, we're going to focus
on the, sorry, focus here

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.330
on the sodium
conductance and explain

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.050
various aspects of the
voltage and time dependence

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.510
of the sodium conductance.

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:01.940
And then once we do
that, we're going

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.980
to turn in the second
half of the lecture

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:10.970
to a really beautiful, simple
model of a disease related

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.120
to a defect in the
sodium channel.

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.170
And it's an example of
how we can use modeling

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:24.430
to test and elaborate on
hypotheses about how defects

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.230
in a circuit, or
in an ion channel,

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:32.670
can lead to very complex
phenotypes in a whole animal.

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.300
So as you recall, our
Hodgkin-Huxley model

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.050
has three conductances
and a capacitance

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:41.780
that represents a capacitor
that represents the capacitance

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:42.830
of the membrane.

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.170
The total membrane
ionic current is just

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.080
a sum of the sodium current,
the potassium current,

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.830
and this voltage independent,
time independent,

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.110
fixed leak current.

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.843
So the equation for
the membrane potential,

00:02:57.843 --> 00:03:00.010
the differential equation
for the membrane potential

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.970
in the Hodgkin-Huxley model,
is just a simple first order

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.440
linear differential
equation that

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:11.650
relates the membrane current
and the membrane potential.

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.240
So last time we described
a set of experiments

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.730
that were done by
Hodgkin and Huxley

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.120
to study the voltage
and time dependence

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.300
of these conductances
in the squid giant axon.

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.900
And as you remember,
this axon is very large.

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.000
It's 1 millimeter
in diameter, which

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.550
makes it very easy
to put wires into it,

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:35.280
and change the voltage, and
measure the currents, and so

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.840
on.

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.020
So the experiment they did was
a voltage clamp experiment,

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:43.740
where you can hyperpolarize
and depolarize the cell.

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:45.930
There's a very fast
feedback system

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.600
that allows you to
set a command voltage,

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.080
and this operational amplifier
injects however much current

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:56.160
is needed to hold the cell at
whatever membrane potential you

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.820
command.

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.710
And the typical experiment
that they would do

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:01.260
would be to hyperpolarize
or depolarize

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.930
the cell to fixed
membrane potentials

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:08.310
and measure how much current
passes through the membrane

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:13.060
during and after that transient
change in the command voltage.

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.110
So if you take a
squid giant axon,

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:18.390
you start at minus
65 millivolts,

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:21.313
and you hyperpolarize the
cell, not much happens.

00:04:21.313 --> 00:04:22.980
And that's because
all of those currents

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:28.350
are already off when the cell
is hyperpolarize at minus 60

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:30.480
or at low voltages.

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:33.180
On the other hand, if you
start at minus 65 millivolts

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:37.560
and depolarize the cell up to 0
millivolts, all of a sudden you

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.190
see a very large
transient current

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:44.040
that first goes negative,
which corresponds

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.860
to positive charges going
into the cell followed

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:50.220
by a positive current
that's associated

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:54.440
with positive charges
leaving the cell.

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:56.720
And last time we
talked about how

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:59.810
we can dissect these two
phases of the current,

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:01.820
this negative phase and
this positive phase,

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:06.020
into two different
ionic conductances.

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:09.740
That they did that experiment
by replacing the sodium

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:13.400
in the extracellular
solution that the axon was

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.940
sitting in with a solution
that has no sodium in it.

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:20.090
They replaced that
with choline chloride.

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:24.030
So choline is a positive ionic--

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:26.220
has a positive charge
and chloride, of course,

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:27.490
has a negative charge.

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:29.240
And so you can replace
the sodium chloride

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:30.157
with choline chloride.

00:05:30.157 --> 00:05:32.480
And now, when you
depolarize your cell,

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:36.180
you can see that that
negative part is gone.

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:39.120
And the only current you
see is this positive--

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:43.170
this kind of slowly ramping
up positive current.

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:47.630
And they identified that as
being due to potassium ions.

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:49.752
And if you subtract
the current curve

00:05:49.752 --> 00:05:52.670
without sodium from the
current curve with sodium,

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:56.060
the difference is
obviously due to sodium.

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:58.490
And so if you plot the
difference between those two

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:02.900
curves, you can see that
the sodium current turns

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:09.680
on very rapidly and then
decays very rapidly,

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:11.930
that that transient
sodium current happens

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:15.410
very quickly, almost before
the potassium current even

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:17.730
gets started.

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:21.670
And we talked about how that
fast sodium current, followed

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:26.530
by a slower potassium current,
is exactly the profile,

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:31.980
that we showed here, that
generates depolarizing change

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:34.360
in the voltage followed
by a hyperpolarize change

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:38.146
in the voltage that looks
like an action potential.

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:43.910
So now, let's just
review quickly how

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:49.330
we took these current curves,
and from those, extracted

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:53.960
the conductance of the sodium
and potassium ion channels

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:57.020
as a function of
voltage and time.

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:59.720
So what we did was
we looked at the case

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:01.460
where we do our voltage
clamp experiment

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:02.660
to different voltages.

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:04.310
We start hyperpolarized.

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:08.930
We step up to minus 40 and
measure this potassium current.

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:13.040
We step up to 0, and you see
this larger potassium current.

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:15.560
If you step from
minus 40 to 40, you

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:18.660
see an even larger
potassium current.

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:23.360
And you can plot this peak
current, or the steady state

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:26.250
current, as a
function of voltage.

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:29.028
That gives you an I-V curve, and
we'll look at that in a second.

00:07:29.028 --> 00:07:31.070
If you do the same thing
for the sodium currents,

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:33.620
you see something
different that's

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:36.750
initially very confusing.

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:38.940
If you step from
minus 80 to minus 40,

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:41.760
you see a small sodium current.

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:44.310
If you make a larger
voltage step up to 0,

00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:47.970
you see this bigger
sodium current.

00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:51.030
But then if you step up
from minus 80 millivolts

00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:52.980
to 40 millivolts, now
you see you just have

00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:55.230
a tiny little sodium current.

00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:57.870
Anybody remember
why that would be?

00:07:57.870 --> 00:08:00.930
Why is it that you would
see only a very tiny sodium

00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:04.517
current, if you step
up to 40 millivolts?

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:16.024
What is the equilibrium
potential for sodium?

00:08:16.024 --> 00:08:17.550
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:18.550
MICHALE FEE: Good, good.

00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:21.790
So what would the
sodium current be

00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:25.810
if I had stepped this voltage
up exactly to 50 millivolts?

00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:26.592
AUDIENCE: 0.

00:08:26.592 --> 00:08:27.550
MICHALE FEE: It'd be 0.

00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:29.530
So this is pretty
close to 50 millivolts,

00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:35.080
which is why the sodium current
is actually pretty small.

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:39.940
So now, let's plot
the peak current

00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:43.360
as a function of voltage for
potassium and the peak current

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:46.750
here as a function of
voltage for sodium.

00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:48.080
That's what that looks like.

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:50.080
So you can see
that the potassium

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:54.800
current is 0 for these
voltages down here and grows.

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:59.030
It's actually stay 0 for
even more negative voltages.

00:08:59.030 --> 00:09:00.660
The sodium current,
on the other hand,

00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:04.400
has this very kind
of funny shape.

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:07.310
It's linear up here
around high voltages,

00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:11.030
around the sodium equilibrium
or reversal potential,

00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:14.650
and then at drops to 0.

00:09:14.650 --> 00:09:19.540
The sodium current stays
at 0 for negative voltages.

00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:23.200
And you recall that we use
this to think about what

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:24.550
the conductance must be.

00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:29.450
So let me just walk you
through that logic again.

00:09:29.450 --> 00:09:32.350
So remember that the current
is just a conductance

00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:34.570
times the driving potential.

00:09:34.570 --> 00:09:37.450
The driving
potential is positive

00:09:37.450 --> 00:09:39.730
when you're above the
equilibrium potential,

00:09:39.730 --> 00:09:43.270
and it's negative
when you're below.

00:09:43.270 --> 00:09:46.090
So this term here
is a straight line.

00:09:46.090 --> 00:09:49.660
It's linear in voltage,
and it goes through 0

00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:53.050
when V is equal to EK.

00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:56.800
So there is the driving
potential for potassium

00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:59.770
as a function of voltage.

00:09:59.770 --> 00:10:04.360
Now, you can see clearly
that the conductance

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:08.740
as a function of voltage
has some voltage dependence,

00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:10.420
because this doesn't
look like this.

00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:12.400
So the difference
between this and this

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:15.200
is captured by this
voltage-dependent conductance.

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:20.620
And does anyone remember what
that conductance, that GK

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:22.090
as a function of V, looks like?

00:10:28.042 --> 00:10:29.034
AUDIENCE: Sigmoidal.

00:10:29.034 --> 00:10:30.410
MICHALE FEE: Yeah, sigmoidal.

00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:33.390
And what is it down here?

00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:34.380
It's 0.

00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:36.690
So the way that you
can get a 0 current,

00:10:36.690 --> 00:10:38.910
even with a very negative
driving potential,

00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:41.550
is if the conductance is 0.

00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:43.890
You can see that the
current is linear up here,

00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:45.810
and the driving potential
is linear up here.

00:10:45.810 --> 00:10:49.720
So the conductance
has to be constant.

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:51.250
And so we have a
conductance that

00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:56.820
has to be 0 down here and a
constant non-zero up here.

00:10:56.820 --> 00:10:57.630
Yes?

00:10:57.630 --> 00:11:00.325
AUDIENCE: So why is
the potassium curve

00:11:00.325 --> 00:11:04.090
0 when it's more
negative than GK?

00:11:04.090 --> 00:11:07.890
Why doesn't it go in
the other direction?

00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:11.375
MICHALE FEE: Why doesn't
this curve do something else?

00:11:11.375 --> 00:11:12.500
So what is it that you're--

00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:13.560
AUDIENCE: Like why doesn't
it-- why doesn't it--

00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:14.700
MICHALE FEE: Why
doesn't it keep going?

00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:15.325
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:11:15.325 --> 00:11:17.363
Why is there like a [INAUDIBLE]?

00:11:17.363 --> 00:11:18.030
MICHALE FEE: Ah.

00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:20.580
Because-- OK.

00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:21.580
That's a great question.

00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:25.360
So maybe you can answer it.

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:28.700
How would I change
the conductance curve

00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:34.130
to make this look
more like this?

00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:38.060
I could do something very
simple to the voltage dependence

00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:40.190
of the potassium
conductance to actually make

00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:41.353
it look like that.

00:11:41.353 --> 00:11:42.020
What would I do?

00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:53.940
The reason this goes
to 0 and stays at 0

00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:57.910
is because the voltage
dependence of the conductance

00:11:57.910 --> 00:12:03.110
turns it off before the driving
potential can go negative.

00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:05.620
So what would I do
to the conductance

00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:11.380
to make this current dip
below 0 before it comes back,

00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:14.346
any suggestions?

00:12:14.346 --> 00:12:15.372
AUDIENCE: Translate it.

00:12:15.372 --> 00:12:16.580
MICHALE FEE: Yeah, which way?

00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:17.450
AUDIENCE: This way.

00:12:17.450 --> 00:12:18.590
MICHALE FEE: Good, exactly.

00:12:18.590 --> 00:12:22.010
So if I took this curve
and I shifted it that way,

00:12:22.010 --> 00:12:25.100
if I made the potassium
conductance turn off

00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:29.930
at a more negative
potential, then this

00:12:29.930 --> 00:12:33.405
would go down before it got
turned off by the conductance.

00:12:33.405 --> 00:12:34.280
Does that make sense?

00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:36.730
Great question.

00:12:36.730 --> 00:12:38.830
Any other questions?

00:12:38.830 --> 00:12:41.770
So the answer is, the reason
this doesn't go negative

00:12:41.770 --> 00:12:44.260
is because the voltage
dependence of the potassium

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:47.380
conductance turns
off the conductance

00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:51.760
before or on the positive
side of the equilibrium

00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:55.262
potential of potassium.

00:12:55.262 --> 00:12:55.762
Yes?

00:12:55.762 --> 00:12:58.684
AUDIENCE: Can you explain
again why the [INAUDIBLE]??

00:13:02.470 --> 00:13:04.510
MICHALE FEE: So if
G were constant,

00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:08.570
if G had no voltage dependence
and it was just a constant,

00:13:08.570 --> 00:13:11.140
what would this
current look like?

00:13:15.710 --> 00:13:17.230
What would it look like?

00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:21.760
If this G were just a constant,
no dependent on voltage?

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:22.680
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:23.430
MICHALE FEE: Good.

00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:27.870
It would look just
like this, right?

00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:31.950
So the reason this curve
shuts off and goes to 0

00:13:31.950 --> 00:13:36.790
is that the conductance
goes to 0 down here,

00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:39.450
and it's constant up here.

00:13:39.450 --> 00:13:41.780
Does that make sense?

00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:44.120
And that curve just
looks like that.

00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:47.000
It's 0 down here and
constant up here.

00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:51.210
Good question.

00:13:51.210 --> 00:13:51.790
Any other?

00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:53.350
There was another hand up here.

00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:53.480
Yeah?

00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:55.188
AUDIENCE: I was
wondering about notation.

00:13:55.188 --> 00:13:57.643
So it's GK of V. It's not
like GK times V, right?

00:13:57.643 --> 00:13:58.310
MICHALE FEE: No.

00:13:58.310 --> 00:14:03.180
It's GK as a function
of V. Yeah, that's--

00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:07.250
the notation is sometimes
a little bit confusing.

00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:10.275
You kind of have to read
it out from the context.

00:14:16.410 --> 00:14:18.360
Any other questions?

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:22.720
So now you can see why this
curve looks the way it does.

00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:29.370
So now, let's plot the driving
potential, V minus Ena.

00:14:29.370 --> 00:14:31.770
That's this curve right here.

00:14:31.770 --> 00:14:36.130
It's Ohm's law, but it has a
battery that makes it centered.

00:14:36.130 --> 00:14:40.920
It makes it give 0 current
when V is equal to Ena,

00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:42.810
which is positive.

00:14:42.810 --> 00:14:44.790
So that's why that
curve looks like that.

00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:47.100
And what is it that
makes the sodium

00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:50.770
current go to 0 down here?

00:14:50.770 --> 00:14:56.220
It must be that the what?

00:14:56.220 --> 00:14:59.304
What about the conductance?

00:14:59.304 --> 00:15:00.190
AUDIENCE: Turns off.

00:15:00.190 --> 00:15:00.940
MICHALE FEE: Good.

00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:03.130
The conductance, the
sodium conductance,

00:15:03.130 --> 00:15:05.890
has to turn off down here.

00:15:05.890 --> 00:15:07.060
And what about up here?

00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:08.600
This is linear.

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:10.600
This is linear, so
the sodium conductance

00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:11.770
has to be what up here?

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:15.680
Constant, good.

00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:18.530
So you can see that
the sodium conductance

00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:23.650
has exactly the same shape
as the potassium conductance.

00:15:23.650 --> 00:15:26.275
It's not exactly at the same
voltage, but it's close.

00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:30.610
Good.

00:15:30.610 --> 00:15:32.290
So now you can see
where this kind

00:15:32.290 --> 00:15:36.070
of weird shape of these
sodium and potassium currents

00:15:36.070 --> 00:15:36.610
comes from.

00:15:36.610 --> 00:15:38.300
It's actually very simple.

00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:42.550
It's just a resistor in series
with a battery that gives you

00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:47.470
this driving potential
offset from 0,

00:15:47.470 --> 00:15:51.130
and that's multiplied by this
voltage-dependent conductance.

00:15:56.110 --> 00:15:59.650
Now, the time dependence
of the conductance

00:15:59.650 --> 00:16:01.420
is entirely due-- sorry.

00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:03.220
The time dependence
of the current,

00:16:03.220 --> 00:16:06.280
that ramping up current
that turns on and then stays

00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:08.950
constant for the
potassium, is entirely

00:16:08.950 --> 00:16:13.570
due to the time dependence
of the potassium conductance.

00:16:13.570 --> 00:16:16.870
So the potassium
conductance just turns on.

00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:19.360
That process of the
conductance turning on

00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:22.160
is called activation.

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:23.180
Same for the sodium--

00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:27.380
the sodium conductance
turns on quickly.

00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:28.730
That's called activation.

00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:31.190
The sodium conductance
turns on very fast,

00:16:31.190 --> 00:16:35.880
and the potassium
conductance turns on slowly.

00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:40.350
Now, we talked about
how the voltage gates

00:16:40.350 --> 00:16:45.700
work in our voltage-dependent
ion channel.

00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:49.380
And the idea is that you
have some gating charges that

00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:52.590
are literally charged
residues, charged amino acids,

00:16:52.590 --> 00:16:55.160
in the protein.

00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:59.400
When the membrane
potential is very negative,

00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:01.410
when the cell is
at rest, you can

00:17:01.410 --> 00:17:03.840
see that there's a large
electric field pointing

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:08.040
that way inside the membrane,
and that pushes the charges,

00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:11.829
pushes those gating charges,
toward the inside of the cell,

00:17:11.829 --> 00:17:14.490
and that closes the gate.

00:17:14.490 --> 00:17:18.180
When you depolarize the
cell, this membrane potential

00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:22.380
goes closer to 0, the
electric field drops,

00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:24.000
and those gating
charges are no longer

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.349
being pushed into the cell.

00:17:26.349 --> 00:17:28.250
And they relax back,
and the gate opens.

00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:36.710
So that is the basic,
sort of a cartoon,

00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:40.280
picture of the mechanism by
which voltage-dependent ion

00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:45.280
channels acquire that
voltage dependence.

00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:48.250
So remember, we
talked about how we

00:17:48.250 --> 00:17:50.380
can model that time dependence.

00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:52.600
We can model that
opened and closed

00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:57.700
state of the ion channel as
two states, an open state

00:17:57.700 --> 00:18:00.220
and a closed state, where
the probability, n, of being

00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:02.603
in the open state, a
probability of 1 minus

00:18:02.603 --> 00:18:03.770
n being in the closed state.

00:18:03.770 --> 00:18:06.010
Remember, this was
for one subunit.

00:18:06.010 --> 00:18:08.470
For the potassium channel,
there are four subunits,

00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:12.350
and all of them have to be open.

00:18:12.350 --> 00:18:14.330
And we wrote down a
differential equation

00:18:14.330 --> 00:18:18.560
for that gating variable, n.

00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:21.750
There is an n infinity,
a steady state,

00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:23.040
that's a function of voltage.

00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:27.810
And remember, for the
potassium, n infinity

00:18:27.810 --> 00:18:31.770
is negative down
here and increases

00:18:31.770 --> 00:18:35.670
as a function of voltage
to get close to 1

00:18:35.670 --> 00:18:41.970
at voltages above minus 50,
or somewhere between minus 50

00:18:41.970 --> 00:18:44.700
and 0 millivolts,
that gating variable.

00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:48.660
And the n infinity of
that gating variable, n,

00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:50.600
goes from being very
small to being large.

00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:56.000
Now, so that's potassium.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.710
We went through that last time.

00:18:58.710 --> 00:19:01.590
And now let's talk about sodium.

00:19:01.590 --> 00:19:04.920
Sodium looks exactly the same.

00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:07.200
The sodium conductance
can be modeled

00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:09.840
as having two states, an open
state and a closed state.

00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:12.270
Remember, we did
a patch recording

00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:14.580
on a single sodium channel.

00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:17.190
You could see that it flickers
back and forth between open

00:19:17.190 --> 00:19:18.420
and closed.

00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:22.710
So we can model that process
in exactly the same way

00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:25.380
that we did for the
potassium conductance.

00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:28.860
We have an open state, a
closed state, a probability, m,

00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:30.160
of being in the open state.

00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:33.390
So m is our gating
variable for--

00:19:33.390 --> 00:19:36.750
our activation gating variable
for the sodium conductance.

00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:40.080
Probability of being in a
closed state is 1 minus m.

00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:43.380
There is that same kind of
differential equation for the m

00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:46.080
gating variable,
and a m infinity

00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:47.910
that has a voltage
dependence that

00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:52.447
looks very much like the voltage
dependence of n infinity.

00:19:55.860 --> 00:20:00.640
So so far, the sodium and
potassium conductances

00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:02.680
look very similar.

00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:09.910
They both have the same kind
of activation gating variable,

00:20:09.910 --> 00:20:13.840
the same simple model for
how to turn on and turn off,

00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:17.290
same differential
equation, same gating

00:20:17.290 --> 00:20:20.500
variable that has this
sigmoidal dependence on voltage.

00:20:23.028 --> 00:20:24.070
Any questions about that?

00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:30.270
So you remember
the way we thought

00:20:30.270 --> 00:20:33.870
about the time
dependence of these

00:20:33.870 --> 00:20:38.610
is we simply integrate
this differential

00:20:38.610 --> 00:20:39.600
equation over time.

00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:41.760
It's a first order linear
differential equation,

00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:44.490
and you can think about
the n, the gating variable,

00:20:44.490 --> 00:20:48.060
as always relaxing
exponentially toward whatever

00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:50.060
n infinity is at that moment.

00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:53.400
And n infinity is a
function of voltage,

00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:55.980
and any time dependence
it gets comes

00:20:55.980 --> 00:20:57.240
from changes in the voltage.

00:20:57.240 --> 00:21:01.330
So we're going to simplify
things and just consider

00:21:01.330 --> 00:21:04.417
piecewise constant
changes in the voltage.

00:21:04.417 --> 00:21:05.750
So let's do a simple experiment.

00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:09.210
We're going to hyperpolarize
the voltage to minus 80.

00:21:09.210 --> 00:21:13.700
What is n infinity going
to be, big or small?

00:21:21.350 --> 00:21:25.306
Remember what n infinity looks
like is a function of voltage?

00:21:25.306 --> 00:21:26.170
AUDIENCE: Small.

00:21:26.170 --> 00:21:26.950
MICHALE FEE: Good.

00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:30.640
So at hyperpolarized voltages,
n infinity is going to be small,

00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:33.070
and so is m infinity.

00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:38.330
Those ion channels are closed
at hyperpolarize voltages.

00:21:38.330 --> 00:21:42.436
So the gating variables
that represent

00:21:42.436 --> 00:21:45.970
what the probability is of being
open, those gating variables

00:21:45.970 --> 00:21:51.310
are small when the voltage
is negative, very negative.

00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:53.800
So then we're going to
step the voltage up.

00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:57.400
And what is n
infinity going to do?

00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:59.177
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:59.177 --> 00:22:01.260
MICHALE FEE: Anybody want
to just draw for me what

00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:02.550
it's going to do in the air?

00:22:02.550 --> 00:22:04.680
It starts out small.

00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:07.740
So is it going to
ramp up slowly?

00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:09.682
Is it going to jump up?

00:22:09.682 --> 00:22:10.890
Is it going to wiggle around?

00:22:10.890 --> 00:22:12.500
What's it going to do?

00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:13.720
So why is it--

00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:15.220
so I have several
different answers.

00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:17.530
I have some people saying
that it's going to ramp up.

00:22:17.530 --> 00:22:22.350
I'm asking about M
infinity now, not n.

00:22:22.350 --> 00:22:26.110
So how many people say it's
going to jump up suddenly?

00:22:26.110 --> 00:22:27.032
OK, good.

00:22:27.032 --> 00:22:28.240
That's what it's going to do.

00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:30.400
It's going to start
out at a small value

00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:36.190
and jump up to a larger value
when you depolarize the cell.

00:22:36.190 --> 00:22:38.286
And then what is n going to do?

00:22:38.286 --> 00:22:39.280
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:44.590
MICHALE FEE: Good. n is going to
start at some initial condition

00:22:44.590 --> 00:22:48.820
and relax exponentially
toward n infinity.

00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:51.990
And then when you turn
the voltage back down,

00:22:51.990 --> 00:22:57.510
N infinity is going to
go from this large value

00:22:57.510 --> 00:23:03.010
back down to a
small value, and n

00:23:03.010 --> 00:23:06.100
is going to relax
exponentially to that smaller

00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:07.630
value of n infinity.

00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:11.300
Any questions about that?

00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:13.500
We saw that last time.

00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:17.470
Now, what is the
conductance going to do?

00:23:17.470 --> 00:23:20.620
Where does the conductance
depend on n, anybody remember,

00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:21.460
for potassium?

00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:29.875
How many subunits are
there in a potassium?

00:23:29.875 --> 00:23:30.500
AUDIENCE: Four.

00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:31.360
MICHALE FEE: Four.

00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:34.840
And so if the probability
that each one is open is n,

00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:37.780
and there are four
independent, what's

00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:40.510
the probability that they're
all going to be open?

00:23:40.510 --> 00:23:41.410
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:41.410 --> 00:23:42.310
MICHALE FEE: Good.

00:23:42.310 --> 00:23:48.490
And so the conductance is going
to turn on as this relaxing

00:23:48.490 --> 00:23:49.900
exponential to the fourth.

00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:53.650
And it's going to have that
kind of gradual ramping up.

00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:00.700
Good.

00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:04.540
It looks exactly
the same for sodium.

00:24:04.540 --> 00:24:09.010
So if you start hyperpolarized,
you depolarized the cell,

00:24:09.010 --> 00:24:10.990
that m infinity is
going to start small,

00:24:10.990 --> 00:24:14.220
it's going to jump
up to a high value.

00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:16.140
M is going to start
small, and it's

00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:18.510
going to relax exponentially
toward that higher

00:24:18.510 --> 00:24:21.080
value of m infinity.

00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:24.270
Now, anybody want to
guess at what the sodium

00:24:24.270 --> 00:24:26.130
conductance will look like?

00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:33.150
It's going to be some
function of m, right?

00:24:33.150 --> 00:24:35.140
It turns out that it m cubed.

00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:43.920
And the reason is
that even though there

00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:48.360
are four things that
have to all be open,

00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:50.430
they're not independent
of each other.

00:24:50.430 --> 00:24:56.610
And so the exponent is not m
to the fourth, it's m cubed.

00:24:56.610 --> 00:24:58.950
And Hodgkin and Huxley
figured that out simply

00:24:58.950 --> 00:25:01.500
by plotting these
relaxing exponentials

00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:04.050
to different powers.

00:25:04.050 --> 00:25:07.650
I imagine them saying,
oh, the potassium is 4.

00:25:07.650 --> 00:25:10.230
Let's take m to the 4.

00:25:10.230 --> 00:25:11.370
But it didn't fit.

00:25:11.370 --> 00:25:14.720
So they tried some other, and
they found that m cubed fits.

00:25:19.850 --> 00:25:21.830
So that's it.

00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:24.310
Now, the problem with
this model is what?

00:25:24.310 --> 00:25:25.850
What is the problem
with this model?

00:25:25.850 --> 00:25:28.070
Is that when you
depolarize the cell,

00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:29.990
the potassium current turns on.

00:25:29.990 --> 00:25:35.090
The potassium conductance turns
on, but then what happens?

00:25:35.090 --> 00:25:36.230
What is-- sorry.

00:25:36.230 --> 00:25:38.220
The sodium turns on.

00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:39.830
What happens?

00:25:39.830 --> 00:25:40.760
It doesn't do this.

00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:43.040
It doesn't turn on
and stay on, right?

00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:45.110
The potassium, when
you depolarize,

00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:47.840
turns on and stays on,
just like that model.

00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:49.580
But the sodium does
something else.

00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:50.596
What does it do?

00:25:50.596 --> 00:25:51.490
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:51.490 --> 00:25:51.970
MICHALE FEE: What's that?

00:25:51.970 --> 00:25:53.262
AUDIENCE: It's a voltage clamp.

00:25:53.262 --> 00:25:55.210
MICHALE FEE: This
is voltage clamp,

00:25:55.210 --> 00:25:59.680
so it's we're
controlling the voltage.

00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:03.630
m is already a maximum here,
so it can't shoot up anymore,

00:26:03.630 --> 00:26:05.670
right?

00:26:05.670 --> 00:26:09.276
Anybody remember what sodium
does that's really weird?

00:26:09.276 --> 00:26:10.270
AUDIENCE: Deactivation.

00:26:10.270 --> 00:26:12.000
MICHALE FEE: It inactivates.

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.500
So the current turns on,
a conductance turns on,

00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:16.530
but it doesn't stay on.

00:26:16.530 --> 00:26:22.830
It turns off, and that's what
we're going to talk about next.

00:26:22.830 --> 00:26:27.960
And once we have that, we've got
the whole Hodgkin-Huxley model.

00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:31.190
And that'll set us up for
this really interesting sodium

00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:35.360
channel defect that we're
going to talk about.

00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:40.900
So that process
there of shutting off

00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:42.370
is called inactivation.

00:26:45.250 --> 00:26:50.320
This process of n turning
on is called activation.

00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:54.960
n turning off is
called deactivation.

00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:57.600
m turning on is
called activation.

00:26:57.600 --> 00:27:00.990
m turning off is
called deactivation.

00:27:00.990 --> 00:27:03.840
But this other thing
has a different name.

00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:05.280
It's called inactivation.

00:27:07.870 --> 00:27:11.630
It's kind of a little
tricky terminology.

00:27:15.860 --> 00:27:19.880
So the potassium-- the
probability of the sodium

00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:21.650
current being--

00:27:21.650 --> 00:27:25.290
the sodium channel
being open actually

00:27:25.290 --> 00:27:30.500
goes like m cubed times some
other gating variable that

00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:34.430
describes how this turns off.

00:27:34.430 --> 00:27:37.040
And so there's another
gating variable, called h.

00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:42.070
It's called the inactivation
gating variable for sodium.

00:27:42.070 --> 00:27:46.240
And so now we're going to
figure out how to think about h

00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:49.190
and how to describe
it mathematically.

00:27:49.190 --> 00:27:50.940
You probably wouldn't
be surprised to hear

00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:53.220
that it's just another first
order linear differential

00:27:53.220 --> 00:27:54.136
equation--

00:27:57.710 --> 00:28:02.260
activation gating variable, m,
inactivation gating variable,

00:28:02.260 --> 00:28:04.550
h.

00:28:04.550 --> 00:28:06.470
So how do we think
about inactivation?

00:28:06.470 --> 00:28:12.590
Inactivation is literally just
a little loop of goo or snot

00:28:12.590 --> 00:28:16.670
on the inside of the sodium
channel, and it's charged.

00:28:16.670 --> 00:28:18.440
And when the sodium
channel opens,

00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:22.280
it just falls in and
plugs up that the pore.

00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:24.610
That's it.

00:28:24.610 --> 00:28:28.532
So when the membrane
potential is very negative,

00:28:28.532 --> 00:28:29.990
the inside of the
cell is negative,

00:28:29.990 --> 00:28:32.590
there's an electric
field pointing this way,

00:28:32.590 --> 00:28:36.290
and the inactivation particle
is slightly positively charged.

00:28:36.290 --> 00:28:40.090
And that pushes it,
keeps it out of the way.

00:28:47.006 --> 00:28:49.360
It turns out that
that's a real thing.

00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:52.690
It turns out it's just a loop
of amino acids on the inside

00:28:52.690 --> 00:28:53.752
of the ion channel.

00:28:53.752 --> 00:28:55.210
Hodgkin and Huxley,
of course, they

00:28:55.210 --> 00:28:58.750
didn't have the structure
of the sodium channel,

00:28:58.750 --> 00:29:02.463
but they actually predicted
the existence of this thing

00:29:02.463 --> 00:29:04.255
that they called the
inactivation particle.

00:29:09.490 --> 00:29:12.660
When you depolarize
the cell, when

00:29:12.660 --> 00:29:16.500
the membrane potential inside
the cell goes more positive,

00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:18.780
that positive
charge is no longer

00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:21.330
actively kept out of the pore.

00:29:21.330 --> 00:29:25.240
And so it falls in
and blocks the pore.

00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:27.080
And that prevents
ions from flowing

00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:28.080
through the ion channel.

00:29:33.620 --> 00:29:35.230
So how would you model this?

00:29:35.230 --> 00:29:39.640
There's an open state
and a closed state

00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:42.380
with energy levels.

00:29:42.380 --> 00:29:44.075
How would you want to do that?

00:29:44.075 --> 00:29:45.290
AUDIENCE: Use the
Boltzmann distribution.

00:29:45.290 --> 00:29:47.748
MICHALE FEE: Yeah, you could
use the Boltzmann distribution

00:29:47.748 --> 00:29:49.520
to compute the
voltage dependence.

00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:53.060
I haven't done that, but I'm
sure it would work pretty well.

00:29:53.060 --> 00:29:55.263
How would you model
the time dependence?

00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:02.840
So let me ask you this.

00:30:02.840 --> 00:30:05.090
If there is a gating variable--
let's start with this.

00:30:05.090 --> 00:30:06.680
If there is a
gating variable, h,

00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:09.920
that we're going to use to
describe this thing getting

00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:13.910
open and closed, what is
the voltage dependence

00:30:13.910 --> 00:30:17.020
of h infinity
going to look like?

00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:21.090
When the voltage is very
negative, what is h doing?

00:30:21.090 --> 00:30:22.320
You think it's big or small?

00:30:25.260 --> 00:30:27.950
Here's the equation-- m cubed h.

00:30:27.950 --> 00:30:34.610
So when the-- yeah, right. h has
to start out high and go small

00:30:34.610 --> 00:30:39.080
in order to explain
this thing turning off.

00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:40.930
Does that make sense?

00:30:40.930 --> 00:30:43.110
So what we're going to do
is we're going to have--

00:30:43.110 --> 00:30:45.900
we're going to model this again
with two states, an open state

00:30:45.900 --> 00:30:48.060
and a closed state.
h is the probability

00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:53.072
that this inactivation
particle is in the open state.

00:30:53.072 --> 00:30:56.690
It turns out that there's
only one of these particles,

00:30:56.690 --> 00:31:00.160
and so that explains
why it's just times h,

00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:01.840
not times h to some power.

00:31:04.860 --> 00:31:07.290
And we have a
differential equation

00:31:07.290 --> 00:31:10.500
that describes how h changes
as a function of time

00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:12.630
in a way that depends
on h infinity.

00:31:12.630 --> 00:31:17.010
And Aditu, why don't you draw
what h infinity probably looks

00:31:17.010 --> 00:31:19.200
like as a function of voltage.

00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:20.100
AUDIENCE: High.

00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:20.850
MICHALE FEE: Yeah.

00:31:20.850 --> 00:31:24.240
It just starts
high and goes down.

00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:25.890
How do we actually measure that?

00:31:25.890 --> 00:31:28.480
Let me show you an experiment
how you'd measure that.

00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:30.600
So first, let me
just show you this.

00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:34.860
So when you depolarize the
cell, h starts out high,

00:31:34.860 --> 00:31:37.590
because h infinity is high.

00:31:37.590 --> 00:31:42.540
And then when you depolarize
the cell, h infinity gets small,

00:31:42.540 --> 00:31:47.010
and h just relaxes exponentially
toward the new smaller h

00:31:47.010 --> 00:31:47.790
infinity.

00:31:47.790 --> 00:31:52.860
And what's really cool is that
the tail, this inactivation,

00:31:52.860 --> 00:31:55.170
the way that conductance
or the current turns off,

00:31:55.170 --> 00:31:57.255
is just a single exponential.

00:31:57.255 --> 00:32:00.495
It just falls like E to the
minus some time constant.

00:32:04.190 --> 00:32:07.880
It's just given by this first
order linear differential

00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:08.380
equation.

00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:12.890
Good.

00:32:12.890 --> 00:32:17.480
This h getting smaller
is called inactivation.

00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:21.425
Anybody want to take a guess
at what this is called?

00:32:21.425 --> 00:32:22.700
AUDIENCE: Deinactivation.

00:32:22.700 --> 00:32:25.640
MICHALE FEE:
Deinactivation, good.

00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:29.030
So there's activation
and deactivation.

00:32:29.030 --> 00:32:32.150
There's inactivation
and deinactivation.

00:32:32.150 --> 00:32:35.360
Those are different things.

00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:38.390
Just remember activation,
which is easy, right?

00:32:38.390 --> 00:32:39.600
It's just things turning on.

00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:41.180
And then there's
the same process

00:32:41.180 --> 00:32:43.440
that undoes the turning on.

00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:45.530
That's deactivation.

00:32:45.530 --> 00:32:48.770
And there's inactivation,
which is a separate particle.

00:32:48.770 --> 00:32:56.390
And it has a process of
blocking and unblocking.

00:32:56.390 --> 00:33:00.658
So it's inactivation,
deinactivation.

00:33:00.658 --> 00:33:01.700
Any questions about that?

00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:02.280
Yes?

00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:03.990
AUDIENCE: If there
is any activation,

00:33:03.990 --> 00:33:06.160
does that mean it's
already charged up?

00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:09.130
So what does deactivation mean?

00:33:09.130 --> 00:33:09.880
MICHALE FEE: Yeah.

00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:12.020
So when-- here.

00:33:12.020 --> 00:33:14.140
Let's just go back
to this picture here.

00:33:14.140 --> 00:33:17.830
When the cell is
hyperpolarized, the thing

00:33:17.830 --> 00:33:21.850
is hanging out outside
not getting in the way.

00:33:21.850 --> 00:33:24.940
When you depolarize the
cell, that electric field

00:33:24.940 --> 00:33:27.970
is not pushing it out
anymore, and it falls in.

00:33:27.970 --> 00:33:30.790
But when you hyperpolarize
the cell again,

00:33:30.790 --> 00:33:34.000
that electric field
turns back on.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:37.190
And what is it going to do?

00:33:37.190 --> 00:33:41.720
It pushes the particle back
out to the other state,

00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:42.710
to the open state.

00:33:47.590 --> 00:33:48.838
Any other questions?

00:33:51.470 --> 00:33:53.330
Pretty simple, right?

00:33:53.330 --> 00:33:55.520
Kind of very machine-like.

00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:03.850
And then what we're
going to talk about soon

00:34:03.850 --> 00:34:09.070
is how this thing sometimes
doesn't work, this thing.

00:34:09.070 --> 00:34:15.460
There are genetic
mutations that turn out

00:34:15.460 --> 00:34:20.260
to be fairly common actually,
where this doesn't reliably

00:34:20.260 --> 00:34:21.190
block the pore.

00:34:24.940 --> 00:34:28.230
And we're going to
see what happens.

00:34:28.230 --> 00:34:30.750
First order linear
differential equation.

00:34:30.750 --> 00:34:35.250
Exponential relaxation
toward new h infinity.

00:34:35.250 --> 00:34:37.770
We can actually
measure this h infinity

00:34:37.770 --> 00:34:41.429
as a function of voltage by
doing the following experiment.

00:34:41.429 --> 00:34:44.909
What we do is we hold
the cell hyperpolarize.

00:34:44.909 --> 00:34:49.260
We can then step the cell up to
different membrane potentials--

00:34:49.260 --> 00:34:51.730
very low or very high.

00:34:51.730 --> 00:34:54.690
And then what we do is we
jump the membrane potential

00:34:54.690 --> 00:34:59.790
up to turn on the
activation gating variable.

00:34:59.790 --> 00:35:01.430
And now we can see--

00:35:01.430 --> 00:35:03.410
what you see is, that
depending on where

00:35:03.410 --> 00:35:06.960
you held the voltage before
you did this big voltage step,

00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:09.440
you get sodium currents
of different size.

00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:12.470
And you can guess that if you
hold the voltage very negative

00:35:12.470 --> 00:35:14.930
and then turn it on,
that activation gating

00:35:14.930 --> 00:35:17.930
variable for all those ion
channels is [AUDIO OUT]..

00:35:17.930 --> 00:35:19.790
And when you turn
on the sodium--

00:35:19.790 --> 00:35:21.350
turn on the gating
variable, you're

00:35:21.350 --> 00:35:24.470
going to get a big
current, right?

00:35:24.470 --> 00:35:29.000
If you hold the cell for a
while here at a higher voltage,

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:31.520
most of those
sodium channels are

00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:35.150
going to have that inactivation
gate already closed.

00:35:35.150 --> 00:35:39.830
And so now when you step
the voltage up, turn on m,

00:35:39.830 --> 00:35:44.360
you're going to get a
much smaller current.

00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:46.330
And so if you just
plot the current size

00:35:46.330 --> 00:35:49.420
as a function of this
holding potential,

00:35:49.420 --> 00:35:53.320
you can see that h is
big for low voltages

00:35:53.320 --> 00:35:55.720
and goes to 0 for
higher voltages.

00:35:55.720 --> 00:36:00.420
And what this means is
that when a cell spikes,

00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:06.360
that voltage goes up, and h
starts falling, and the sodium

00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:07.105
channels--

00:36:07.105 --> 00:36:08.730
many of the sodium
channels in the cell

00:36:08.730 --> 00:36:11.040
becomes inactivated--
become inactivated.

00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:11.720
Yes?

00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:14.440
AUDIENCE: The membrane
potential on the x-axis,

00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:18.105
is that the difference in the--
is that [AUDIO OUT] or is that

00:36:18.105 --> 00:36:18.990
the [INAUDIBLE]?

00:36:18.990 --> 00:36:23.690
MICHALE FEE: That's the absolute
voltage during this holding.

00:36:23.690 --> 00:36:24.560
That's right.

00:36:24.560 --> 00:36:28.580
You can actually see at
rest most cells actually

00:36:28.580 --> 00:36:31.250
have a substantial fraction
of the sodium channels

00:36:31.250 --> 00:36:32.947
already inactivated.

00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:45.930
So here's the plan.

00:36:45.930 --> 00:36:50.250
We now have a full
description of the potassium

00:36:50.250 --> 00:36:56.340
and the sodium conductances as
a function of voltage and time.

00:36:56.340 --> 00:36:59.310
So we're to put it
all together and make

00:36:59.310 --> 00:37:04.460
a full quantitative description
of the Hodgkin-Huxley model.

00:37:04.460 --> 00:37:08.690
Our probability of the sodium
current, sodium channel,

00:37:08.690 --> 00:37:11.210
being open is m cubed h.

00:37:11.210 --> 00:37:14.630
I just want to mention
that this m cubed

00:37:14.630 --> 00:37:17.510
h assumes one thing
about the gating variable

00:37:17.510 --> 00:37:20.350
and the inactivation variable.

00:37:20.350 --> 00:37:25.700
The mechanism for activation and
the mechanism for inactivation

00:37:25.700 --> 00:37:27.010
assumes what about them?

00:37:27.010 --> 00:37:28.260
AUDIENCE: They're independent.

00:37:28.260 --> 00:37:29.635
MICHALE FEE:
They're independent.

00:37:29.635 --> 00:37:32.540
And it turns out that
that's not quite true.

00:37:32.540 --> 00:37:36.020
It's one of the very few
things that Hodgkin and Huxley

00:37:36.020 --> 00:37:38.540
didn't get spot-on.

00:37:38.540 --> 00:37:43.597
So it's not exactly independent,
but it's really not bad either.

00:37:43.597 --> 00:37:45.680
So it's a pretty-- it's
still a pretty good model.

00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:50.960
We can write down the
sodium conductance

00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:53.240
as just the conductance
of the sodium channel

00:37:53.240 --> 00:37:55.910
when it's all the way
open times m cubed h.

00:37:55.910 --> 00:37:56.780
Yes?

00:37:56.780 --> 00:38:00.320
AUDIENCE: So do we know what
the inactivation particle is?

00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:01.070
MICHALE FEE: Yeah.

00:38:01.070 --> 00:38:02.362
We're going to see in a second.

00:38:02.362 --> 00:38:04.520
I'll show you exactly
what it looks like

00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:08.660
and where these
mutations are that have

00:38:08.660 --> 00:38:11.700
this effect on inactivation.

00:38:11.700 --> 00:38:18.080
So we can write down
the conductance,

00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:19.497
and we can write
down the current.

00:38:19.497 --> 00:38:22.600
The current is just
the open conductance

00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:28.010
times m cubed h times
the driving potential.

00:38:28.010 --> 00:38:30.700
And that's our sodium current.

00:38:30.700 --> 00:38:32.114
Yes?

00:38:32.114 --> 00:38:34.350
AUDIENCE: For the
[INAUDIBLE],, I'm

00:38:34.350 --> 00:38:40.438
not showing there is
[INAUDIBLE] like a number,

00:38:40.438 --> 00:38:43.048
like sodium channel
or something.

00:38:43.048 --> 00:38:43.977
It doesn't have it.

00:38:43.977 --> 00:38:45.310
MICHALE FEE: Yeah, that's right.

00:38:45.310 --> 00:38:52.960
It's one, one single protein,
but it has these transmembrane

00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:57.210
alpha-helices that act--

00:38:57.210 --> 00:38:59.680
are multiple voltage sensors.

00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:03.580
And they act somewhat
independently, but still

00:39:03.580 --> 00:39:05.200
a little bit
cooperatively, and that's

00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:07.990
where this m cubed comes from.

00:39:07.990 --> 00:39:08.710
But you're right.

00:39:08.710 --> 00:39:12.460
The potassium channel actually
has four separate subunits

00:39:12.460 --> 00:39:14.890
that form a tetramer.

00:39:14.890 --> 00:39:19.608
The sodium channel [AUDIO OUT]
that it's all one big protein.

00:39:19.608 --> 00:39:20.150
That's right.

00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:22.810
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:22.810 --> 00:39:23.560
MICHALE FEE: Yeah.

00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:25.510
You should really
think of this--

00:39:25.510 --> 00:39:27.970
I mean the n and
the m were both--

00:39:27.970 --> 00:39:30.610
it was empirically
discovered that one

00:39:30.610 --> 00:39:34.180
goes as n to the fourth, and
the other one goes as m cubed.

00:39:34.180 --> 00:39:35.680
And it turns out
for potassium it

00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:38.550
has a really beautiful
relation to the structure.

00:39:38.550 --> 00:39:40.150
For sodium, it's a
little bit messier.

00:39:40.150 --> 00:39:43.510
And I'm sure there are people
who actually understand more

00:39:43.510 --> 00:39:47.170
about why it's exactly
m cubed, but I'm not

00:39:47.170 --> 00:39:48.036
one of those people.

00:39:48.036 --> 00:39:53.560
So I'm going to refer
you to the literature.

00:39:53.560 --> 00:39:56.280
And I'm happy-- maybe I can
find a good reference for that.

00:40:00.050 --> 00:40:03.230
So now that we have the sodium
conductance and the sodium

00:40:03.230 --> 00:40:05.160
current, let's put
this all together.

00:40:05.160 --> 00:40:07.370
So here's how we're
going to now--

00:40:07.370 --> 00:40:09.800
here's the algorithm for
generating an action potential.

00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:11.750
And we introduced
this last time,

00:40:11.750 --> 00:40:14.810
but let's just flesh it
out for the full story.

00:40:14.810 --> 00:40:20.105
So given an initial voltage,
compute n infinity, tau n,

00:40:20.105 --> 00:40:24.350
m infinity, tau m, and
h infinity and tau h,

00:40:24.350 --> 00:40:25.820
as a function of that voltage.

00:40:25.820 --> 00:40:28.880
Those are just those
algebraic expressions

00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:30.950
that give you the
alpha n and beta

00:40:30.950 --> 00:40:35.090
n for each of those
things-- one for potassium,

00:40:35.090 --> 00:40:39.400
one for sodium, the m, and
one for the h for sodium.

00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:41.600
So we're going to
calculate all of those.

00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:44.510
Steady state gating variables
as a function of voltage,

00:40:44.510 --> 00:40:47.800
we're going to start from our
initial condition of n, m,

00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:50.840
and h, and integrate that
differential equation one time

00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:51.860
step using--

00:40:55.550 --> 00:40:57.560
it's going to
relax exponentially

00:40:57.560 --> 00:41:01.110
toward n infinity.

00:41:01.110 --> 00:41:04.590
We're going to plug that n,
m, and h into our equations

00:41:04.590 --> 00:41:06.900
for the potassium
current, sodium

00:41:06.900 --> 00:41:10.300
current, and leak, which doesn't
have those gating variables.

00:41:10.300 --> 00:41:13.620
So the potassium current is
Gn to the 4 times the driving

00:41:13.620 --> 00:41:14.430
potential.

00:41:14.430 --> 00:41:19.253
Sodium current is Gm cubed h
[AUDIO OUT] driving potential.

00:41:19.253 --> 00:41:20.920
We're going to add
all of those currents

00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:24.830
together to give the
total membrane current.

00:41:24.830 --> 00:41:26.990
That membrane current
is going to give us

00:41:26.990 --> 00:41:31.820
a V infinity for our cell.

00:41:31.820 --> 00:41:35.780
Remember, the V infinity
is just the current times

00:41:35.780 --> 00:41:37.130
the effective resistance.

00:41:37.130 --> 00:41:39.110
So we can use that
to also calculate

00:41:39.110 --> 00:41:43.440
the membrane time constant.

00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:47.890
And then we integrate the
voltage one time step.

00:41:47.890 --> 00:41:55.480
Go back and recompute those
n, m, and h infinities.

00:41:55.480 --> 00:41:57.500
And then we just keep
cycling through this.

00:41:57.500 --> 00:42:01.310
When you do that, and
you plot the voltage,

00:42:01.310 --> 00:42:03.840
you get an action potential.

00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:05.690
Now, you can do
that in a hundredth

00:42:05.690 --> 00:42:07.155
of a second in MATLAB.

00:42:07.155 --> 00:42:09.530
Hodgkin and Huxley we're doing
this on their slide rules,

00:42:09.530 --> 00:42:12.265
and they got 2/3 of the way
through an action potential

00:42:12.265 --> 00:42:14.270
and said, let's just publish.

00:42:14.270 --> 00:42:16.394
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:22.660 --> 00:42:24.220
So here's what that looks like.

00:42:24.220 --> 00:42:29.110
Here's V as a function
of time for when you

00:42:29.110 --> 00:42:32.020
implement that loop in MATLAB.

00:42:32.020 --> 00:42:33.400
So you can see what you did.

00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:35.650
So this is the injected
current through the electrode,

00:42:35.650 --> 00:42:37.830
and can see it
starts to depolarize

00:42:37.830 --> 00:42:40.240
the cell a little bit.

00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:43.410
And at some point,
what happens is--

00:42:43.410 --> 00:42:46.960
this is just a copy over here
so you can line things up--

00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:50.380
when you inject current, the
cell starts to depolarize.

00:42:50.380 --> 00:42:53.150
And you can see that
m starts to grow.

00:42:53.150 --> 00:42:56.270
The sodium current is
starting to turn on.

00:42:56.270 --> 00:43:00.680
And at some point,
m gets big enough

00:43:00.680 --> 00:43:04.520
that it's turning on a
substantial amount of sodium

00:43:04.520 --> 00:43:06.963
current into the cell.

00:43:06.963 --> 00:43:07.880
And what does that do?

00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:11.690
It depolarizes to cell more,
which causes m to grow faster,

00:43:11.690 --> 00:43:15.350
which causes more current, which
depolarizes the cell faster.

00:43:15.350 --> 00:43:18.050
And it just runs away-- bam--

00:43:18.050 --> 00:43:21.080
until you reach
essentially the equilibrium

00:43:21.080 --> 00:43:24.272
potential of sodium.

00:43:24.272 --> 00:43:25.980
And then what does
the sodium current do?

00:43:25.980 --> 00:43:31.160
The sodium current
actually stops

00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:33.460
even though the channel's open.

00:43:33.460 --> 00:43:37.390
Then what happens is, during
that whole time, n has,

00:43:37.390 --> 00:43:40.570
in this hyperpolarized voltage--

00:43:40.570 --> 00:43:48.010
the potassium channel is
starting to open and grows,

00:43:48.010 --> 00:43:51.280
potassium current
conductance turns on,

00:43:51.280 --> 00:43:54.910
and that starts
hyperpolerizing the cell.

00:43:54.910 --> 00:44:01.410
During that whole time,
the inactivation gate--

00:44:01.410 --> 00:44:05.270
this cell is very
depolarized, very positive.

00:44:05.270 --> 00:44:12.650
That little bit of
goo falls in, h drops.

00:44:12.650 --> 00:44:16.880
That shuts off the
sodium conductance.

00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:22.860
Potassium conductance finishes
bringing the cell back.

00:44:22.860 --> 00:44:23.850
Beautiful, right?

00:44:30.950 --> 00:44:31.450
Yes?

00:44:31.450 --> 00:44:33.840
AUDIENCE: Is h just
the voltage-dependent

00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:36.880
or it's also time-dependent?

00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:41.320
MICHALE FEE: Time-dependent
in exactly the same way

00:44:41.320 --> 00:44:45.460
that n and m are time-dependent.

00:44:45.460 --> 00:44:50.560
There is a-- h infinity
changes as a sum--

00:44:50.560 --> 00:44:52.120
as a function of voltage.

00:44:52.120 --> 00:44:57.520
And then h relaxes
exponentially toward h infinity.

00:45:04.720 --> 00:45:05.920
Any questions about that?

00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:08.260
So for the problem set,
you'll have code for this,

00:45:08.260 --> 00:45:10.960
and you can play around with
this and try different things.

00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:13.600
And then there's a
particular problem

00:45:13.600 --> 00:45:16.345
that Daniel and I cooked
up for you for this.

00:45:16.345 --> 00:45:18.220
I'll basically show you
what that looks like.

00:45:18.220 --> 00:45:21.610
Here's the crux of it.

00:45:21.610 --> 00:45:24.340
If you inject a
little bit of current

00:45:24.340 --> 00:45:26.830
into the Hodgkin-Huxley
neuron, you get a spike.

00:45:26.830 --> 00:45:28.880
And then if you wait
a few milliseconds

00:45:28.880 --> 00:45:33.280
and inject another current
pulse, what happens?

00:45:37.090 --> 00:45:38.050
You don't get a spike.

00:45:40.630 --> 00:45:44.645
Can anybody guess why that is?

00:45:44.645 --> 00:45:47.120
AUDIENCE: h is
still inactivated.

00:45:47.120 --> 00:45:47.870
MICHALE FEE: Yeah.

00:45:47.870 --> 00:45:50.780
That thing is still
stuck in there

00:45:50.780 --> 00:45:55.830
and hasn't had time
to fall out yet.

00:45:55.830 --> 00:45:59.300
And if you plot h, you can see
that it hasn't recovered back

00:45:59.300 --> 00:46:02.910
to the state it was
at the beginning.

00:46:02.910 --> 00:46:06.930
So that's called a
"refractory period."

00:46:06.930 --> 00:46:12.810
So cells don't like to spike
two times in a row to close.

00:46:12.810 --> 00:46:13.565
Yes?

00:46:13.565 --> 00:46:16.475
AUDIENCE: So what things
like [INAUDIBLE] h at which

00:46:16.475 --> 00:46:17.980
it's a spike?

00:46:17.980 --> 00:46:18.730
MICHALE FEE: Yeah.

00:46:18.730 --> 00:46:22.430
So you want to just like--

00:46:22.430 --> 00:46:24.080
what would be the
intuitive answer?

00:46:27.690 --> 00:46:31.670
So there's not a
hard cutoff, right?

00:46:31.670 --> 00:46:34.390
If h is right here, it
will be much harder.

00:46:34.390 --> 00:46:37.600
You'd have to inject a lot
more current to make it spike.

00:46:37.600 --> 00:46:40.390
If h is recovered
to here, then it

00:46:40.390 --> 00:46:42.970
would take a little bit less
current to make it spike.

00:46:42.970 --> 00:46:46.427
So basically, there's
a gradual decrease

00:46:46.427 --> 00:46:48.010
in the amount of
current it would take

00:46:48.010 --> 00:46:51.040
to make the neuron spike again.

00:46:51.040 --> 00:46:52.610
So there's no one answer.

00:46:57.800 --> 00:47:02.400
So let's take a
look at what happens

00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:03.980
when sodium channels go bad.

00:47:07.606 --> 00:47:08.273
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:47:08.273 --> 00:47:10.190
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:47:10.190 --> 00:47:12.490
- Most of the animals
on this petting farm,

00:47:12.490 --> 00:47:18.170
on Maui, Hawaii, are sweet,
but nothing too unusual.

00:47:18.170 --> 00:47:22.370
And then there are the goats--

00:47:22.370 --> 00:47:25.280
Myotonic goats, to be specific--

00:47:25.280 --> 00:47:28.450
more commonly known
as stiff-legged goats,

00:47:28.450 --> 00:47:34.700
wooden-leg goats, nervous
goats, fainting goats.

00:47:34.700 --> 00:47:38.340
Fainting goats are
indigenous to North America.

00:47:38.340 --> 00:47:40.500
But that name is a
bit of a misnomer,

00:47:40.500 --> 00:47:42.360
because they never
lose consciousness

00:47:42.360 --> 00:47:44.500
when they keel over.

00:47:44.500 --> 00:47:47.970
If they're startled, a genetic
condition causes their muscles

00:47:47.970 --> 00:47:49.290
to lock up.

00:47:49.290 --> 00:47:52.020
But it only lasts a few
moments, and then they're

00:47:52.020 --> 00:47:53.350
back on their feet.

00:47:53.350 --> 00:47:57.060
Now, until the next
time they're spooked.

00:47:57.060 --> 00:48:00.170
[END PLAYBACK]

00:48:00.170 --> 00:48:03.160
MICHALE FEE: So
these fainting goats

00:48:03.160 --> 00:48:09.640
have a particular mutation
in their sodium channel.

00:48:09.640 --> 00:48:12.400
Now, it turns out that
the sodium channels that

00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:14.860
are in your brain that
control action potentials

00:48:14.860 --> 00:48:18.460
are a different gene
than the sodium channels

00:48:18.460 --> 00:48:21.630
that are in your muscles that
produce muscle contractions.

00:48:21.630 --> 00:48:27.040
So you can have a mutation
in the skeletal isoform

00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:32.110
of the sodium channel that
produces these muscular effects

00:48:32.110 --> 00:48:35.530
without having any
effect on brain function.

00:48:35.530 --> 00:48:38.430
But that same
mutation in the brain,

00:48:38.430 --> 00:48:43.450
isoform of the sodium
channel, is lethal.

00:48:43.450 --> 00:48:47.110
So this is actually a condition
that exists in humans.

00:48:47.110 --> 00:48:50.260
It's called-- there are
actually a whole set of these,

00:48:50.260 --> 00:48:53.830
what are called "sodium
channel myotonias."

00:48:53.830 --> 00:48:58.420
One of them is called
hyperkalemic periodic

00:48:58.420 --> 00:49:00.410
paralysis.

00:49:00.410 --> 00:49:03.900
And this just
shows a different--

00:49:03.900 --> 00:49:07.890
this is a different phenotype
of one of these sodium channel

00:49:07.890 --> 00:49:09.100
defects.

00:49:09.100 --> 00:49:14.020
So the goats became very
stiff and fell over.

00:49:14.020 --> 00:49:17.076
It turns out there's a different
phenotype that looks like this.

00:49:23.750 --> 00:49:26.950
So basically, it causes
extreme weakness.

00:49:26.950 --> 00:49:29.860
The muscles are
completely paralyzed.

00:49:29.860 --> 00:49:33.370
They can't contract
anymore, and it

00:49:33.370 --> 00:49:38.020
seems like that would be a
completely different effect--

00:49:38.020 --> 00:49:40.540
what would cause
muscles to just go

00:49:40.540 --> 00:49:45.505
rigid and a very similar
thing would cause paralysis--

00:49:45.505 --> 00:49:48.080
and it turns out that
actually those two things

00:49:48.080 --> 00:49:49.790
have very similar cause.

00:49:49.790 --> 00:49:54.770
That hyperkalemic-- kalemic
refers to potassium.

00:49:54.770 --> 00:49:58.460
And so this condition is very
sensitive to potassium levels.

00:49:58.460 --> 00:50:00.950
At high potassium
levels, it's much worse

00:50:00.950 --> 00:50:04.040
than at low potassium levels.

00:50:04.040 --> 00:50:07.840
So there can be an attack
of weakness or paralysis,

00:50:07.840 --> 00:50:11.740
and then just a few minutes
later somebody's all better,

00:50:11.740 --> 00:50:15.880
and that paralysis goes away.

00:50:15.880 --> 00:50:20.010
So to understand what's
going on in this condition,

00:50:20.010 --> 00:50:24.710
we need to take a look at how
muscle fibers actually work.

00:50:24.710 --> 00:50:28.340
So let's take a
little detour in that.

00:50:28.340 --> 00:50:32.060
So basically, let's start
here with the action potential

00:50:32.060 --> 00:50:34.370
that drives muscle twitches.

00:50:34.370 --> 00:50:37.310
So the way this works is
that it an action potential

00:50:37.310 --> 00:50:40.640
will propagate down an axon
toward the neuromuscular

00:50:40.640 --> 00:50:41.840
junction.

00:50:41.840 --> 00:50:46.640
That action potential will cause
the release of neurotransmitter

00:50:46.640 --> 00:50:52.570
that then causes current to
flow into the muscle fiber.

00:50:52.570 --> 00:50:55.030
That current flowing
into the muscle fiber

00:50:55.030 --> 00:50:58.690
depolarizes it, turns
on sodium channels,

00:50:58.690 --> 00:51:01.750
and that causes an action
potential in the muscle fiber

00:51:01.750 --> 00:51:04.360
that looks very much
like the action potential

00:51:04.360 --> 00:51:09.740
that we just saw for a neuron
for the squid giant axon.

00:51:09.740 --> 00:51:12.160
Now, there is this
famous problem,

00:51:12.160 --> 00:51:15.230
called the "excitation
contraction coupling problem,"

00:51:15.230 --> 00:51:18.040
which is, how does an
action potential here

00:51:18.040 --> 00:51:23.115
on the surface of a muscle fiber
get down into the myofibril

00:51:23.115 --> 00:51:25.390
and cause a contraction
of the muscle?

00:51:29.363 --> 00:51:31.280
So we'll get to that
question, but let me just

00:51:31.280 --> 00:51:32.610
describe what these things are.

00:51:32.610 --> 00:51:37.610
So the myofibrils--
the myofibril

00:51:37.610 --> 00:51:43.230
is this little element inside
of the muscle fiber itself.

00:51:43.230 --> 00:51:52.130
And these are bundles of thick
fibers and thin fibers that

00:51:52.130 --> 00:51:53.910
essentially--

00:51:53.910 --> 00:51:55.460
here, I think it's
on the next slide.

00:51:59.010 --> 00:52:02.280
So let me just finish the
story about how the action

00:52:02.280 --> 00:52:03.870
potential gets inside.

00:52:03.870 --> 00:52:06.960
So the action
potential propagates

00:52:06.960 --> 00:52:10.260
through these little structures
called transverse tubules.

00:52:10.260 --> 00:52:13.830
These are little tubes that go
from the surface of the muscle

00:52:13.830 --> 00:52:18.150
fiber down into the muscle cell.

00:52:18.150 --> 00:52:19.720
They're like axons.

00:52:19.720 --> 00:52:22.120
But instead of going
out from the cell body,

00:52:22.120 --> 00:52:24.840
they go into the cell body.

00:52:24.840 --> 00:52:25.860
That's pretty cool.

00:52:25.860 --> 00:52:26.980
This thing is huge.

00:52:26.980 --> 00:52:32.650
This muscle fiber is
about 100 microns across.

00:52:32.650 --> 00:52:36.900
So in order for that signal
to get into the myofibril

00:52:36.900 --> 00:52:38.430
to cause contraction,
it actually

00:52:38.430 --> 00:52:40.410
has to propagate
down an axon that

00:52:40.410 --> 00:52:42.540
goes into the muscle fiber.

00:52:45.390 --> 00:52:47.700
So that action potential
propagates down

00:52:47.700 --> 00:52:53.600
into the t-tubules that's a
voltage pulse that opens up

00:52:53.600 --> 00:52:58.760
voltage-dependent calcium
channels that activate

00:52:58.760 --> 00:53:00.980
calcium release in
something called

00:53:00.980 --> 00:53:02.510
the sarcoplasmic reticulum.

00:53:02.510 --> 00:53:04.760
So you may remember
that in neurons

00:53:04.760 --> 00:53:08.840
the endoplasmic reticulum
sequesters calcium.

00:53:08.840 --> 00:53:11.270
In a muscle fiber, the
sarcoplasmic reticulum

00:53:11.270 --> 00:53:12.120
does the same thing.

00:53:12.120 --> 00:53:13.490
It's sequesters calcium.

00:53:13.490 --> 00:53:15.200
But when this voltage
pulse comes down

00:53:15.200 --> 00:53:17.690
the t-tubule, its
voltage-dependent calcium

00:53:17.690 --> 00:53:20.220
channels, which cause
the release of calcium,

00:53:20.220 --> 00:53:23.480
which then activates
calcium-dependent calcium

00:53:23.480 --> 00:53:25.610
release through another
set of channels,

00:53:25.610 --> 00:53:31.380
and it basically floods the
myofibrils with calcium.

00:53:31.380 --> 00:53:33.720
And that triggers
the contraction.

00:53:33.720 --> 00:53:35.580
And here's how that works.

00:53:35.580 --> 00:53:40.210
Within these myofibrils are
bundles of thick filaments,

00:53:40.210 --> 00:53:45.060
which are myosin and thin
filaments, which are actin.

00:53:45.060 --> 00:53:52.080
The thick filaments are
these structures right here.

00:53:52.080 --> 00:53:54.990
The actin are filaments,
thin filaments,

00:53:54.990 --> 00:54:02.010
that intercalate between
the myosin thick filaments.

00:54:02.010 --> 00:54:07.410
The myosin thick filaments
are covered with these myosin

00:54:07.410 --> 00:54:08.760
molecules that stick out.

00:54:08.760 --> 00:54:13.650
The myosin heads that are
like little feet reach out.

00:54:13.650 --> 00:54:17.040
And if they bind
to the actin, then

00:54:17.040 --> 00:54:21.120
these things basically grab the
actin and start walking along.

00:54:21.120 --> 00:54:23.830
And they pull the actin.

00:54:23.830 --> 00:54:26.220
They pull this actin
filament this way.

00:54:26.220 --> 00:54:29.100
The ones over here
walk this direction

00:54:29.100 --> 00:54:31.440
and pull this actin
filament that way,

00:54:31.440 --> 00:54:36.615
and that causes these
two end plates to pull,

00:54:36.615 --> 00:54:39.660
sorry, these two, what
are called "z disks,"

00:54:39.660 --> 00:54:41.670
to pull together.

00:54:41.670 --> 00:54:42.985
And the thing shortens.

00:54:42.985 --> 00:54:43.860
Does that make sense?

00:54:46.540 --> 00:54:48.780
And then when the
contraction stops,

00:54:48.780 --> 00:54:51.870
these little feet stop walking.

00:54:51.870 --> 00:54:55.470
They relax, and those
actin filaments now

00:54:55.470 --> 00:54:58.110
can relax and retract.

00:54:58.110 --> 00:54:59.670
Pretty cool, right?

00:54:59.670 --> 00:55:02.090
So how does the calcium
connect to that?

00:55:02.090 --> 00:55:05.475
So the calcium goes in,
floods this myofibril.

00:55:05.475 --> 00:55:09.240
The calcium goes in and binds
to these little molecules,

00:55:09.240 --> 00:55:14.380
called troponin, that are
sitting in grooves of the actin

00:55:14.380 --> 00:55:15.340
filaments.

00:55:15.340 --> 00:55:17.710
And when the calcium
binds to troponin,

00:55:17.710 --> 00:55:19.930
it moves out of the
way and opens up

00:55:19.930 --> 00:55:23.860
the binding site for
these myosin heads to grab

00:55:23.860 --> 00:55:25.180
onto the actin filament.

00:55:25.180 --> 00:55:29.050
They grab on and they pull.

00:55:29.050 --> 00:55:32.980
And as soon as they
pull, an ATP comes off.

00:55:32.980 --> 00:55:36.160
These things open
up, ATP binds, boom.

00:55:36.160 --> 00:55:37.630
They pull again.

00:55:37.630 --> 00:55:42.580
So they just walk along
with one ATP per cycle.

00:55:42.580 --> 00:55:43.780
Then when the calcium--

00:55:43.780 --> 00:55:47.050
what happens is that the calcium
starts being sequestered back

00:55:47.050 --> 00:55:51.040
into the sarcoplasmic reticulum
that unbinds from the troponin.

00:55:51.040 --> 00:55:53.320
The troponin falls
back into the groove,

00:55:53.320 --> 00:55:57.790
and the myosin heads can no
longer connect to the actin.

00:55:57.790 --> 00:56:01.330
And that's the end
of the muscle twitch.

00:56:01.330 --> 00:56:02.320
Pretty amazing, right?

00:56:06.480 --> 00:56:13.770
So what goes wrong when sodium
channels are inactivated?

00:56:13.770 --> 00:56:16.270
And that's what we're going to
talk about next-- when sodium

00:56:16.270 --> 00:56:18.610
channels fail to inactivate.

00:56:18.610 --> 00:56:22.490
So here's what the sodium
channel looks like.

00:56:22.490 --> 00:56:30.020
There are these clusters of
transmembrane alpha-helices.

00:56:30.020 --> 00:56:32.270
These things together,
these four things together,

00:56:32.270 --> 00:56:34.680
form the pore.

00:56:34.680 --> 00:56:38.240
And there's a loop
between them here

00:56:38.240 --> 00:56:41.810
that produces the inactivation.

00:56:41.810 --> 00:56:44.840
And you can see, if
you look at the sights

00:56:44.840 --> 00:56:47.900
of different mutations
of the sodium channel

00:56:47.900 --> 00:56:50.750
that produce defective
inactivation,

00:56:50.750 --> 00:56:54.590
they tend to be clustered
in these cytoplasmic loops

00:56:54.590 --> 00:56:55.640
of the sodium channel.

00:57:00.550 --> 00:57:04.200
So myotonia and the
periodic paralysis

00:57:04.200 --> 00:57:06.090
that we just saw
in those movies are

00:57:06.090 --> 00:57:12.390
caused by these different sets
of mutations on those loops.

00:57:12.390 --> 00:57:17.340
And again, for these
myotonias, these mutations

00:57:17.340 --> 00:57:21.680
are in the skeletal isoform
of the sodium channel.

00:57:21.680 --> 00:57:26.590
So now, what do those
mutations actually do to this?

00:57:26.590 --> 00:57:28.230
So now, let's take
a look at-- let's do

00:57:28.230 --> 00:57:30.870
a patch clamp
experiment, where we take

00:57:30.870 --> 00:57:35.260
muscle fiber from a wild-type.

00:57:35.260 --> 00:57:37.830
So you can just take
a muscle biopsy--

00:57:37.830 --> 00:57:40.080
extract a little
pinch of muscle.

00:57:40.080 --> 00:57:43.050
You can culture it in a dish.

00:57:43.050 --> 00:57:45.970
And you can do that for
wild-type, normal human muscle

00:57:45.970 --> 00:57:46.470
fibers.

00:57:46.470 --> 00:57:49.650
And you can do it
for muscle fibers

00:57:49.650 --> 00:57:55.860
from a person with this
particular mutation

00:57:55.860 --> 00:57:57.210
of this sodium channel.

00:57:57.210 --> 00:57:59.940
And you can see that just
like for the neurons,

00:57:59.940 --> 00:58:02.650
just like for the sodium
channels in neurons,

00:58:02.650 --> 00:58:08.220
you can see that
depolarizing this ion channel

00:58:08.220 --> 00:58:13.240
produces brief openings that
are aligned at the time when

00:58:13.240 --> 00:58:16.030
you do the depolarization step.

00:58:16.030 --> 00:58:18.520
And then there are
no more openings.

00:58:18.520 --> 00:58:21.280
The sodium channels
turn on, and then

00:58:21.280 --> 00:58:26.510
that gating variable,
that inactivation gate,

00:58:26.510 --> 00:58:30.650
shuts off the pores, and
there are no more openings.

00:58:30.650 --> 00:58:36.750
But in the muscle fiber
that has this mutation,

00:58:36.750 --> 00:58:40.820
you can see that you get
this burst of openings right

00:58:40.820 --> 00:58:45.480
at the time of depolarization,
but you keep getting openings

00:58:45.480 --> 00:58:46.305
at later times.

00:58:49.820 --> 00:58:55.230
And if you plot the average
current over many trials,

00:58:55.230 --> 00:58:57.170
you can see in
normal fibers there's

00:58:57.170 --> 00:58:59.630
this very brief
pulse of opening,

00:58:59.630 --> 00:59:03.520
and in these fibers, muscle
fibers, with a mutation,

00:59:03.520 --> 00:59:10.270
there is a constant extended
high probability of that sodium

00:59:10.270 --> 00:59:12.930
channel turning on, opening up.

00:59:12.930 --> 00:59:17.450
And that's what causes all
the problems right there.

00:59:17.450 --> 00:59:21.400
In these conditions, that
only represents about a 2%,

00:59:21.400 --> 00:59:26.520
a 0.02 probability,
of turning on

00:59:26.520 --> 00:59:29.761
at a time when a normal muscle
fiber would be inactivated.

00:59:35.070 --> 00:59:38.360
So you can actually study
these things in more detail.

00:59:38.360 --> 00:59:40.210
So this shows a set of
experiments that were

00:59:40.210 --> 00:59:45.490
done in rat fast twitch muscle.

00:59:45.490 --> 00:59:48.790
This shows a control, and
this shows a muscle fiber

00:59:48.790 --> 00:59:54.220
that's been treated with a
toxin that comes from the sea

00:59:54.220 --> 01:00:00.610
anemone that produces a
toxin that uses this toxin

01:00:00.610 --> 01:00:03.315
to actually help catch prey.

01:00:03.315 --> 01:00:04.690
And it turns out,
what that toxin

01:00:04.690 --> 01:00:10.420
does is it mimics the
effect of this blockage

01:00:10.420 --> 01:00:13.780
of the inactivation
of the sodium channel.

01:00:13.780 --> 01:00:16.720
So you can see that
applying this toxin

01:00:16.720 --> 01:00:20.770
also produces these
extended openings

01:00:20.770 --> 01:00:24.480
or failures to inactivate.

01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:27.490
If you take that toxin and you
[AUDIO OUT] to a muscle fiber,

01:00:27.490 --> 01:00:29.520
you see something
really interesting.

01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:30.760
You take a muscle fiber.

01:00:30.760 --> 01:00:34.710
You can hook it up to--

01:00:34.710 --> 01:00:37.560
tie a string to one end, and
tie a string to the other end,

01:00:37.560 --> 01:00:39.780
and kind pull it
tight a little bit,

01:00:39.780 --> 01:00:43.890
and measure the force that
that muscle fiber is exerting.

01:00:43.890 --> 01:00:46.840
So you can measure force
as a function of time.

01:00:46.840 --> 01:00:48.690
If you stimulate
that muscle fiber

01:00:48.690 --> 01:00:50.880
with a little
electrical shock, you

01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:54.330
can elicit what's
called a muscle twitch.

01:00:57.020 --> 01:01:00.800
And in the presence
of this ATXII toxin,

01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:06.030
you can see that that twitch
is very extended in time.

01:01:06.030 --> 01:01:07.260
Is there a question?

01:01:07.260 --> 01:01:08.290
Did I see a hand?

01:01:08.290 --> 01:01:08.790
No.

01:01:11.410 --> 01:01:12.270
So what's going on?

01:01:12.270 --> 01:01:15.850
So you can now record
from this muscle fiber

01:01:15.850 --> 01:01:20.650
when it's been treated with
this toxin that produces

01:01:20.650 --> 01:01:25.030
what's called a myotonic run.

01:01:25.030 --> 01:01:28.540
And you can see that [AUDIO OUT]
muscle fiber produces

01:01:28.540 --> 01:01:34.850
a single or maybe two action
potentials when depolarize it.

01:01:34.850 --> 01:01:38.650
That's what a muscle
fiber normally does.

01:01:38.650 --> 01:01:43.450
But when you treat
it with this ATXII,

01:01:43.450 --> 01:01:46.522
it generates many
action potentials.

01:01:46.522 --> 01:01:47.940
Now, why would that be?

01:01:47.940 --> 01:01:50.910
Does that make sense?

01:01:50.910 --> 01:01:55.640
We're going to
explore why that is.

01:01:55.640 --> 01:01:58.340
We're going to look at
a particular model for

01:01:58.340 --> 01:01:59.870
how the sodium--

01:01:59.870 --> 01:02:02.090
the failure to inactivate
of the sodium channel

01:02:02.090 --> 01:02:04.040
produces these myotonic runs.

01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:06.500
What's really crazy is
that after you turn off

01:02:06.500 --> 01:02:11.950
that current injection that
activates the muscle fiber,

01:02:11.950 --> 01:02:13.320
the neuron keeps spiking.

01:02:13.320 --> 01:02:14.745
The muscle fiber keeps spiking.

01:02:20.130 --> 01:02:23.280
That continued
spiking corresponds

01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:26.590
to continued contraction
of the muscle.

01:02:26.590 --> 01:02:30.240
So you can trigger the muscle
to generate some action

01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:31.860
potentials in a
normal muscle that

01:02:31.860 --> 01:02:34.140
produces a very brief twitch.

01:02:34.140 --> 01:02:38.220
But in these muscles with
this mutated sodium channel--

01:02:38.220 --> 01:02:39.630
in this case it's
with the toxin,

01:02:39.630 --> 01:02:43.620
but the same thing happens
in the muscle fibers with

01:02:43.620 --> 01:02:45.350
the mutated sodium channel--

01:02:45.350 --> 01:02:48.660
it produces continued
contraction of the muscle.

01:02:48.660 --> 01:02:51.760
And that's what was
happening to the goats.

01:02:51.760 --> 01:02:54.680
Their muscles contracted,
and then they didn't relax.

01:02:54.680 --> 01:02:57.543
And so they were stiff like
this, and then they fall over.

01:03:02.280 --> 01:03:06.510
Now, that's called
a myotonic run.

01:03:06.510 --> 01:03:09.300
It's really interesting
and was a big clue

01:03:09.300 --> 01:03:15.930
to what the mechanism
is that produces this.

01:03:15.930 --> 01:03:18.810
If you take these muscle
fibers and you put them

01:03:18.810 --> 01:03:25.890
into a solution that doesn't
have the right osmolarity--

01:03:25.890 --> 01:03:34.130
so too much, two too many
ions, too high an osmolarity,

01:03:34.130 --> 01:03:37.970
or too low an osmolarity, just
like pure water, for example--

01:03:37.970 --> 01:03:40.970
produces what's called
an osmotic shock.

01:03:40.970 --> 01:03:45.130
And what it does is it
breaks all the t-tubules

01:03:45.130 --> 01:03:47.380
from the membrane.

01:03:47.380 --> 01:03:49.720
So it doesn't
break the membrane,

01:03:49.720 --> 01:03:54.780
but it disconnects all the
t-tubules from the membrane.

01:03:54.780 --> 01:03:58.930
Now, what happens is you see
the myotonic run goes away.

01:03:58.930 --> 01:04:03.490
So something about the t-tubules
is causing this myotonic run.

01:04:10.390 --> 01:04:23.150
So there's a really beautiful
set of papers from David Corey

01:04:23.150 --> 01:04:29.040
and a person named Cannon, who
proposed a hypothesis for why

01:04:29.040 --> 01:04:32.550
this actually happens, and I'll
walk you through the hypothesis

01:04:32.550 --> 01:04:34.140
right now.

01:04:34.140 --> 01:04:35.860
So here's the idea.

01:04:35.860 --> 01:04:40.870
So when you have an
input from a motor neuron

01:04:40.870 --> 01:04:46.740
onto the muscle fiber you get
synaptic input, [AUDIO OUT]

01:04:46.740 --> 01:04:47.520
muscle fibers.

01:04:47.520 --> 01:04:49.140
So this is the motor
neuron synapse.

01:04:49.140 --> 01:04:51.090
That's the muscle fiber.

01:04:51.090 --> 01:04:55.200
So you should think about this
as being a very long cell here,

01:04:55.200 --> 01:04:59.730
and here's a t-tubule that's
represented by a channel coming

01:04:59.730 --> 01:05:00.690
in from the surface.

01:05:00.690 --> 01:05:06.160
So this is a cross-section
of the muscle fiber.

01:05:06.160 --> 01:05:08.300
So the idea is that
that current injection

01:05:08.300 --> 01:05:11.840
causes an action potential,
which causes sodium

01:05:11.840 --> 01:05:13.580
to flow into the cell.

01:05:13.580 --> 01:05:18.270
And on the hyperpolarize
phase of the action potential,

01:05:18.270 --> 01:05:21.860
potassium goes out of the
cell to bring the cell back

01:05:21.860 --> 01:05:25.170
down to a negative voltage.

01:05:25.170 --> 01:05:28.575
Now, that actual potential
propagates into the t-tubule,

01:05:28.575 --> 01:05:30.200
which means you're
going to have sodium

01:05:30.200 --> 01:05:32.480
flowing into the cell
and potassium flowing out

01:05:32.480 --> 01:05:33.380
of the cell.

01:05:33.380 --> 01:05:38.040
But out of the cell means
into the t-tubule, right?

01:05:38.040 --> 01:05:40.650
So what normally happens is,
after an action potential,

01:05:40.650 --> 01:05:44.640
you're left with an excess
of potassium in the t-tubule.

01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:51.139
So what happens-- think is
going to happen, anybody?

01:05:56.067 --> 01:05:57.400
Think back to the first lecture.

01:06:01.638 --> 01:06:02.630
Yeah?

01:06:02.630 --> 01:06:04.130
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:06:04.130 --> 01:06:05.713
MICHALE FEE: Yeah,
there's going to be

01:06:05.713 --> 01:06:07.550
some pumping going on here.

01:06:07.550 --> 01:06:09.350
But actually, most
of the potassium

01:06:09.350 --> 01:06:13.460
gets out of the t-tubule
by a different mechanism.

01:06:13.460 --> 01:06:15.390
It gets out by diffusion.

01:06:15.390 --> 01:06:18.860
So these extra potassium
ions diffuse out

01:06:18.860 --> 01:06:24.700
through that t-tubule back
into the extracellular space.

01:06:24.700 --> 01:06:27.840
Now, can we estimate how
long it takes that to happen?

01:06:30.700 --> 01:06:32.810
Any idea how we would do that?

01:06:36.380 --> 01:06:39.190
Anybody want to take a guess?

01:06:39.190 --> 01:06:41.570
Does anyone remember
how long it takes an ion

01:06:41.570 --> 01:06:44.640
to diffuse across, let's
say, a cell body, 10 microns?

01:06:50.250 --> 01:06:51.930
Kind of a few tens
of milliseconds,

01:06:51.930 --> 01:06:53.560
right, 50 milliseconds?

01:06:53.560 --> 01:06:55.970
This thing is about
25 microns long.

01:06:55.970 --> 01:06:59.140
And so it will be
maybe four times that.

01:06:59.140 --> 01:07:01.350
So that timescale
we can calculate

01:07:01.350 --> 01:07:06.180
by just using our equation
for the relation between time

01:07:06.180 --> 01:07:08.190
and distance for a
diffusion, and you

01:07:08.190 --> 01:07:12.540
find that that's about
300 to 400 milliseconds.

01:07:12.540 --> 01:07:15.950
So that's how long it
takes those potassium ions

01:07:15.950 --> 01:07:19.340
to diffuse out of the t-tubule.

01:07:19.340 --> 01:07:28.290
Now, what happens
when we have a sodium

01:07:28.290 --> 01:07:31.440
ion that isn't inactivating?

01:07:31.440 --> 01:07:34.750
What happens is you're going
to get a lot more spikes.

01:07:34.750 --> 01:07:36.850
You're going to get a lot
more spikes generated,

01:07:36.850 --> 01:07:39.760
because this sodium
current turns on,

01:07:39.760 --> 01:07:42.120
but now it's not
properly inactivating.

01:07:42.120 --> 01:07:44.300
And so you're going
to get extra spikes.

01:07:44.300 --> 01:07:47.890
And those failure to enact
[AUDIO OUT] extra spikes,

01:07:47.890 --> 01:07:49.550
and extra spikes
means you're going

01:07:49.550 --> 01:07:53.460
to have a lot more potassium
going into the t-tubule.

01:07:59.820 --> 01:08:03.710
So what is all that--

01:08:03.710 --> 01:08:07.340
and remember, we now have
300 or 400 milliseconds

01:08:07.340 --> 01:08:10.070
before that potassium can
get out of the t-tubule

01:08:10.070 --> 01:08:11.960
by diffusion.

01:08:11.960 --> 01:08:13.490
So what's going
to happen when you

01:08:13.490 --> 01:08:19.293
have all that extra
potassium in the t-tubule?

01:08:19.293 --> 01:08:20.210
What's it going to do?

01:08:23.633 --> 01:08:24.611
Yeah, [INAUDIBLE]?

01:08:24.611 --> 01:08:27.060
AUDIENCE: It corrects the
muscle fiber [INAUDIBLE]..

01:08:27.060 --> 01:08:28.210
MICHALE FEE: Yeah.

01:08:28.210 --> 01:08:32.840
So remember, the
equilibrium potential,

01:08:32.840 --> 01:08:34.930
the negative
equilibrium potential

01:08:34.930 --> 01:08:39.370
of the muscle fiber, which
is normally, like any cell,

01:08:39.370 --> 01:08:45.090
is down around minus 80,
that negative potential

01:08:45.090 --> 01:08:47.100
is caused because
there's so much more

01:08:47.100 --> 01:08:50.580
potassium inside the cell
than outside the cell.

01:08:50.580 --> 01:08:52.649
And so the potassium
ions are normally

01:08:52.649 --> 01:08:55.080
kind of leaking out of
a cell, and that keeps

01:08:55.080 --> 01:08:56.640
the membrane potential low.

01:08:56.640 --> 01:08:57.600
But now, if you--

01:08:57.600 --> 01:09:00.020
remember, this is
outside the cell.

01:09:00.020 --> 01:09:02.430
So you have now, suddenly,
a very high concentration

01:09:02.430 --> 01:09:04.560
of potassium ions
outside the cell.

01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:05.670
And what do they do?

01:09:05.670 --> 01:09:08.100
They push their way back in.

01:09:08.100 --> 01:09:13.390
They start diffusing back in,
which does what to the cell?

01:09:13.390 --> 01:09:15.689
You now have
potassium ions going

01:09:15.689 --> 01:09:20.430
the wrong way, which does what?

01:09:20.430 --> 01:09:22.487
I think you already
gave the answer.

01:09:22.487 --> 01:09:23.029
Say it again.

01:09:23.029 --> 01:09:23.660
AUDIENCE: Depolarizes it.

01:09:23.660 --> 01:09:25.355
MICHALE FEE:
Depolarizes the cell.

01:09:25.355 --> 01:09:30.752
Puts potassium back in, and
it depolarizes the cell.

01:09:30.752 --> 01:09:31.960
And what is that going to do?

01:09:37.684 --> 01:09:39.120
AUDIENCE: Cause more spikes.

01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:43.310
MICHALE FEE: Cause more spikes,
which is going to do what?

01:09:43.310 --> 01:09:46.212
Push more potassium
into the t-tubule.

01:09:46.212 --> 01:09:50.740
It's runaway instability.

01:09:50.740 --> 01:09:55.630
So that's kind of a
cool hypothesis, right?

01:09:55.630 --> 01:09:58.030
You could imagine all sorts
of experiments to test this.

01:09:58.030 --> 01:10:00.238
Like you could put a little
thing in there to measure

01:10:00.238 --> 01:10:02.030
potassium concentration
in the t-tubule.

01:10:02.030 --> 01:10:05.070
Well, that's only a
few microns across.

01:10:05.070 --> 01:10:07.390
How do you test this hypothesis?

01:10:07.390 --> 01:10:12.770
How would you--
it's a great idea.

01:10:12.770 --> 01:10:15.570
But how do you know if it even
makes any sense when you put it

01:10:15.570 --> 01:10:19.130
all together, any suggestions?

01:10:23.080 --> 01:10:23.700
Yeah?

01:10:23.700 --> 01:10:28.412
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
the potassium.

01:10:28.412 --> 01:10:29.120
MICHALE FEE: Yep.

01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:32.480
So it's already known
that at low potassium

01:10:32.480 --> 01:10:34.850
this problem is less severe.

01:10:34.850 --> 01:10:40.610
The disease is even named after
that observation-- hyperkalemic

01:10:40.610 --> 01:10:43.260
periodic paralysis.

01:10:43.260 --> 01:10:44.310
Any other suggestions?

01:10:44.310 --> 01:10:45.810
What are we here for?

01:10:45.810 --> 01:10:46.875
What is this class?

01:10:50.790 --> 01:10:54.810
Introduction to neural
computation, right?

01:10:54.810 --> 01:10:56.730
So what can we do?

01:10:56.730 --> 01:10:59.390
This is a word model, right?

01:10:59.390 --> 01:11:01.830
When you actually
put it all together,

01:11:01.830 --> 01:11:05.820
you could do all this,
and when you model it,

01:11:05.820 --> 01:11:07.515
it makes no sense whatsoever.

01:11:07.515 --> 01:11:09.390
There's something wrong
with this word model.

01:11:09.390 --> 01:11:11.955
Neuroscience is
full of word models.

01:11:15.700 --> 01:11:20.170
The only way to know if a
word model makes any sense

01:11:20.170 --> 01:11:23.710
is to actually write
down some equations

01:11:23.710 --> 01:11:28.000
and see if it works the way
you think it is going to work.

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:32.070
See if your word model
translates into math.

01:11:32.070 --> 01:11:36.360
And so that's what David
Corey and Cannon did.

01:11:36.360 --> 01:11:41.440
They took this picture,
and they developed a model

01:11:41.440 --> 01:11:42.970
for what that looks like it.

01:11:42.970 --> 01:11:46.300
And it started with just
the Hodgkin-Huxley model.

01:11:46.300 --> 01:11:47.380
Here's Hodgkin-Huxley.

01:11:47.380 --> 01:11:49.420
That's what we've
been using all along.

01:11:49.420 --> 01:11:51.430
They added another
little compartment

01:11:51.430 --> 01:11:55.240
that represents the conductances
and the batteries associated

01:11:55.240 --> 01:11:58.460
with the membrane
in the t-tubule.

01:11:58.460 --> 01:12:01.090
And notice, there's a EK here.

01:12:01.090 --> 01:12:02.470
What does EK depend on?

01:12:06.961 --> 01:12:07.960
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:12:07.960 --> 01:12:09.260
MICHALE FEE: Say it again.

01:12:09.260 --> 01:12:12.075
EK depends on--

01:12:12.075 --> 01:12:12.950
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:12:12.950 --> 01:12:13.846
MICHALE FEE: Of--

01:12:13.846 --> 01:12:14.742
AUDIENCE: Potassium.

01:12:14.742 --> 01:12:15.640
AUDIENCE: Potassium.

01:12:15.640 --> 01:12:18.450
MICHALE FEE: Of potassium
ions, and potassium

01:12:18.450 --> 01:12:21.150
ions are changing.

01:12:21.150 --> 01:12:25.980
So let's actually-- so
this part you already know.

01:12:25.980 --> 01:12:28.595
That's just Hodgkin and Huxley
with a few extra resistors

01:12:28.595 --> 01:12:29.720
attached to the side of it.

01:12:32.510 --> 01:12:33.760
What about the potassium part?

01:12:33.760 --> 01:12:36.760
Let's just flesh out that
model a little bit more

01:12:36.760 --> 01:12:40.450
to see how spiking activity
would lead to changes

01:12:40.450 --> 01:12:42.340
in potassium, how that
change in potassium

01:12:42.340 --> 01:12:43.930
would change the
battery, and how

01:12:43.930 --> 01:12:47.200
that would feedback and
change the spiking activity.

01:12:47.200 --> 01:12:48.800
So let's do that.

01:12:48.800 --> 01:12:52.390
So we're going to
imagine that we

01:12:52.390 --> 01:12:55.123
are going to model our
potassium conductance in here.

01:12:55.123 --> 01:12:57.040
So we're going to write
down a variable that's

01:12:57.040 --> 01:13:00.130
the potassium concentration
inside the t-tubule.

01:13:03.150 --> 01:13:08.020
And what is going to affect
that potassium concentration?

01:13:08.020 --> 01:13:10.920
What are the sources
of potassium?

01:13:10.920 --> 01:13:13.840
What are the sinks of
potassium, anybody?

01:13:19.230 --> 01:13:21.630
Well, one is just diffusion.

01:13:21.630 --> 01:13:25.050
So we can model that, and that
looks an awful lot, actually,

01:13:25.050 --> 01:13:27.520
like Fick's first law.

01:13:27.520 --> 01:13:29.900
So the change in
potassium concentration

01:13:29.900 --> 01:13:32.480
as a function of time
has a contribution

01:13:32.480 --> 01:13:36.110
from the difference between
the potassium concentration

01:13:36.110 --> 01:13:37.130
inside and outside.

01:13:40.110 --> 01:13:42.810
That rate of change
through diffusion

01:13:42.810 --> 01:13:45.960
is proportional to the
difference in concentration

01:13:45.960 --> 01:13:48.570
inside and outside divided
by that time constant

01:13:48.570 --> 01:13:50.106
that we've just calculated.

01:13:54.210 --> 01:13:57.640
Now, what-- so that's
how potassium leaves.

01:13:57.640 --> 01:14:01.330
That's one way that
potassium leaves.

01:14:01.330 --> 01:14:06.240
So the potassium gets
into the t-tubule

01:14:06.240 --> 01:14:08.550
at a rate that's just
proportional to the potassium

01:14:08.550 --> 01:14:09.120
current.

01:14:09.120 --> 01:14:12.600
The rate of change of the
potassium concentration

01:14:12.600 --> 01:14:16.610
is proportional to
the potassium current.

01:14:16.610 --> 01:14:17.952
And the potassium current--

01:14:17.952 --> 01:14:19.910
so let's just flesh this
out a little bit more.

01:14:19.910 --> 01:14:21.650
This, we already calculated.

01:14:21.650 --> 01:14:23.960
This is the conductance
times the driving potential.

01:14:23.960 --> 01:14:27.830
But that current, we have to
do a little bit of changes

01:14:27.830 --> 01:14:29.870
of units to get
current into the right

01:14:29.870 --> 01:14:33.050
units for a change in
potassium concentration

01:14:33.050 --> 01:14:34.380
as a function of time.

01:14:34.380 --> 01:14:38.240
So current is
coulombs per second,

01:14:38.240 --> 01:14:45.570
and here we have moles
per liter per second.

01:14:45.570 --> 01:14:47.990
So we need to divide
by two things.

01:14:47.990 --> 01:14:51.530
We need the volume
of the t-tubule,

01:14:51.530 --> 01:14:53.450
and we need Faraday's
constant, which

01:14:53.450 --> 01:14:56.360
is just coulombs per mole.

01:14:56.360 --> 01:14:59.410
That's a well-known number
that you can just look up.

01:14:59.410 --> 01:15:01.010
Multiply those two
things together,

01:15:01.010 --> 01:15:03.550
you get the contribution
of the potassium current

01:15:03.550 --> 01:15:08.070
to the rate of change of
potassium concentration.

01:15:08.070 --> 01:15:10.890
The potassium current is
just conductance times

01:15:10.890 --> 01:15:12.720
driving potential.

01:15:12.720 --> 01:15:16.080
Notice the EK is a function
of potassium concentration.

01:15:16.080 --> 01:15:18.030
I haven't written it in
here, but that's just

01:15:18.030 --> 01:15:19.837
the Nernst potential.

01:15:19.837 --> 01:15:21.420
And so we have a
differential equation

01:15:21.420 --> 01:15:24.750
for the potassium concentration
as a function of time.

01:15:24.750 --> 01:15:29.400
It's a function of the
potassium concentration voltage

01:15:29.400 --> 01:15:32.630
and equilibrium potential.

01:15:32.630 --> 01:15:37.620
And now, we just take that
and add it to the code

01:15:37.620 --> 01:15:40.155
that we already have
for Hodgkin and Huxley.

01:15:43.070 --> 01:15:45.040
And here's what you get.

01:15:45.040 --> 01:15:47.200
So here's a normal muscle fiber.

01:15:47.200 --> 01:15:50.690
You get a single
action potential.

01:15:50.690 --> 01:15:52.310
What they did was they modeled--

01:15:52.310 --> 01:15:54.770
they made some fraction
of those ion channels

01:15:54.770 --> 01:15:55.700
fail to inactivate.

01:15:55.700 --> 01:15:57.200
And here's what
happens to the model

01:15:57.200 --> 01:16:04.010
when you make 2% sodium
channels fail to inactivate.

01:16:04.010 --> 01:16:08.600
You see that you get this large
number of action potentials,

01:16:08.600 --> 01:16:13.080
because the sodium channels
are not inactivating properly.

01:16:13.080 --> 01:16:15.800
And when you turn
the current off,

01:16:15.800 --> 01:16:18.740
you get this high
potassium concentration

01:16:18.740 --> 01:16:23.820
in the t-tubule that's now
causing additional spikes.

01:16:23.820 --> 01:16:30.550
That is continued
contraction of the muscle.

01:16:30.550 --> 01:16:34.630
That is this myotonia.

01:16:34.630 --> 01:16:37.370
The model is
exhibiting myotonia.

01:16:37.370 --> 01:16:39.280
How do you explain
periodic paralysis?

01:16:39.280 --> 01:16:40.840
That's totally different, right?

01:16:40.840 --> 01:16:43.408
Now the muscle just
goes completely limp.

01:16:43.408 --> 01:16:44.200
How do you do that?

01:16:44.200 --> 01:16:45.970
Any thoughts about this?

01:16:48.970 --> 01:16:50.470
What do you think
would happen if we

01:16:50.470 --> 01:16:54.520
made a slightly larger
fraction of the sodium channels

01:16:54.520 --> 01:16:57.604
fail to inactivate?

01:16:57.604 --> 01:17:00.540
Here's what happens.

01:17:00.540 --> 01:17:03.790
You get more and more
action potentials.

01:17:03.790 --> 01:17:10.090
And at some point, what happens
is the voltage just locks up.

01:17:10.090 --> 01:17:12.250
The sodium channels go
into a different state

01:17:12.250 --> 01:17:15.160
where the system is
no longer oscillating.

01:17:15.160 --> 01:17:19.030
It's just fixed
at a high voltage.

01:17:19.030 --> 01:17:22.920
It's called
depolarization block,

01:17:22.920 --> 01:17:29.830
and it's what happens when
there's no longer enough--

01:17:29.830 --> 01:17:32.770
there aren't enough
sodium channels

01:17:32.770 --> 01:17:36.100
active to give you
spiking, but there

01:17:36.100 --> 01:17:40.090
are enough non-inactivated
sodium channels to just hold

01:17:40.090 --> 01:17:41.710
the voltage high.

01:17:41.710 --> 01:17:46.250
And this muscle fiber is
no longer able to contract,

01:17:46.250 --> 01:17:48.530
and it's completely flaccid.

01:17:48.530 --> 01:17:50.600
It's completely loose.

01:17:50.600 --> 01:17:56.310
And so this is the hyperkalemic
periodic paralysis.

01:17:56.310 --> 01:18:01.280
So you get both of these
really interesting phenotypes

01:18:01.280 --> 01:18:05.760
in this disease just depending
on one little parameter, which

01:18:05.760 --> 01:18:10.470
is what fraction of
these sodium channels

01:18:10.470 --> 01:18:12.530
are failing to inactivate.

01:18:12.530 --> 01:18:17.790
And so you can see, you get
this very complex phenotype

01:18:17.790 --> 01:18:22.780
from a simple mutation
of an ion channel.

01:18:22.780 --> 01:18:29.100
And in order to understand
really how it's behaving,

01:18:29.100 --> 01:18:31.160
you have to do
modeling like this.

01:18:31.160 --> 01:18:36.490
It's the way you understand
a system and how it works.

01:18:36.490 --> 01:18:42.100
Until you do this, you
don't really understand it.

01:18:42.100 --> 01:18:43.730
So I'll leave it there.

01:18:43.730 --> 01:18:45.420
Thank you.

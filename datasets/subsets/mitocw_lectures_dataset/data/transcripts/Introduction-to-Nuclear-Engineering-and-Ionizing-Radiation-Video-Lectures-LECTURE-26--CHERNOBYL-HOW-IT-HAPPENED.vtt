00:00:22.078 --> 00:00:23.120
MICHAEL SHORT: All right.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:26.270
So like I told you guys, Friday
marked the end of the hardest

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:27.080
part of the course.

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.020
And Monday marked the
end of the hardest Pset.

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:31.700
So because the rest
of your classes

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:33.410
are going full
throttle, this one's

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.180
going to wind down a little bit.

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.080
So today, I'd say,
sit back, relax,

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.680
and enjoy a nuclear
catastrophe because we

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.340
are going to explain what
happened at Chernobyl now

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.030
that you've got the physics
and intuitive background

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.240
to understand the actual
sequence of events.

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.430
To kick it off, I
want to show you guys

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.120
some actual footage of
the Chernobyl reactor

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.230
as it was burning.

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.106
So this is the part that
most folks know about.

00:01:00.106 --> 00:01:01.534
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:01:01.534 --> 00:01:03.438
- [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.930
MICHAEL SHORT: This is footage
taken from a helicopter

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.897
from folks that were either
surveying or dropping materials

00:01:13.897 --> 00:01:14.605
onto the reactor.

00:01:18.243 --> 00:01:25.920
- [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.590
MICHAEL SHORT: That was
probably a bad idea.

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:30.990
"Hold where the smoke is."

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.165
We'll get into
what the smoke was.

00:01:33.165 --> 00:01:49.976

00:01:49.976 --> 00:01:51.880
[END PLAYBACK]

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.860
MICHAEL SHORT: So that
red stuff right there,

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.640
that's actually glowing
graphite amongst other materials

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.510
from the graphite fire that
resulted from the RBMK reactor

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:06.250
burning after the Chernobyl
accident, caused by both flaws

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.970
in the physical design
of the RBMK reactor

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.190
and absolute operator
of stupidity and neglect

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.010
of any sort of safety
systems or safety culture.

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:16.480
We're lucky to
live here in the US

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.430
where our worst accident
at Three Mile Island

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.070
was not actually really
that much of an accident.

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:22.870
There was a partial meltdown.

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.810
There was not that much of
a release of radio nuclides

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.760
into the atmosphere
because we do

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.910
things like build
containments on our reactors.

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:33.265
If you think of what a
typical reactor looks like,

00:02:33.265 --> 00:02:36.580
like if you consider the
MIT reactor as a scaled-down

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.913
version of a normal reactor--

00:02:39.913 --> 00:02:41.830
let's say you have a
commercial power reactor.

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:43.510
You've got the core here.

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.260
You've got a bunch of
shielding around it.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:52.230
And you've got a dome
that's rather thick

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.193
that comprises the containment.

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.522
That would be the core.

00:02:59.522 --> 00:03:00.730
This would be some shielding.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.670
So this is what you find in
US and most other reactors.

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:14.280
For the RBMK reactors,
there was no containment

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.460
because it was thought
that nothing could happen.

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:19.530
And boy, were they wrong.

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.860
So I want to walk you guys
through a chronology of what

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.410
actually happened at that
the Chernobyl reactor, which

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.460
you guys can read on the NEA, or
Nuclear Energy Agency, website,

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:31.418
the same place that
you find JANIS.

00:03:31.418 --> 00:03:33.960
And we're going to refer to a
lot of the JANIS cross sections

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:36.930
to explain why these
sorts of events happened.

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.300
So the whole point of
what happened at Chernobyl

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:42.120
was it was desire
to see if you could

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.880
use the spinning down
turbine after you shut

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.250
down the reactor to
power the emergency

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.643
systems at the reactor.

00:03:49.643 --> 00:03:51.060
This would be
following something,

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.970
what's called a loss
of off-site power.

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:55.710
If the off-site
power or the grid

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:57.660
was disconnected
from the reactor,

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.820
the reactor
automatically shuts down.

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:02.070
But the turbine, like I
showed you a couple weeks ago,

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:05.730
is this enormous spinning
hulk of metal and machinery

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:09.370
that coasts down over a long
period of, let's say, hours.

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:11.970
And as it's spinning,
the generator coils

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:15.120
are still spinning and
still producing electricity,

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.290
or they could be.

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:18.209
So it was desire
to find out, can we

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:21.779
use the spinning down turbine
to power the emergency equipment

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:23.580
if we lose off-site power?

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.650
So they had to
simulate this event.

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:27.810
So what they actually
decided to do

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:31.320
is coast down the reactor
to a moderate power level

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.840
or very low power and
see what comes out

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.910
of the turbine itself, or
out of the generator rather.

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:41.787
Now, there were a lot of
flaws in the RBMK design.

00:04:41.787 --> 00:04:43.370
And I'd like to bring
it up here so we

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:45.770
can talk about
what it looks like

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:47.480
and what was wrong with it.

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:51.560
So the RBMK is unlike any
of the United States light

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.830
water reactors that you
may have seen before.

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:55.340
Many of the components
are the same.

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:58.400
There's still a light
water reactor coolant

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.610
loop where water flows
around fuel rods,

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:03.530
goes into a steam
separator, better known

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:05.190
as a big heat exchanger.

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:09.500
And the steam drives a
turbine, which produces energy.

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:11.490
And then this coolant
pump keeps it going.

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:13.400
And then the water circulates.

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.610
What makes it different, though,
is that each of these fuel rods

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:19.490
was inside its
own pressure tube.

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:22.040
So the coolant was pressurized.

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:24.410
And out here, this
stuff right here

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:27.700
was the moderator
composed of graphite.

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:29.800
Unlike light water
reactors in the US,

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:33.070
the coolant was not the only
moderator in the reactor.

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:34.960
Graphite also
existed, which meant

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:39.100
that, if the water went away,
which would normally shut down

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:41.710
a light water reactor
from lack of moderation,

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:44.890
graphite was still there
to slow the neutrons down

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:48.330
into the high-fission
cross-section area.

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:51.790
And I'd like to pull
up JANIS and show you

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:55.770
what I mean with the
uranium cross section.

00:05:55.770 --> 00:06:00.280
So let's go again to uranium-235
and pull up its fission cross

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:01.870
section.

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:02.790
Let's see fission.

00:06:08.104 --> 00:06:10.940
I can make it a
little thicker too.

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:14.210
So again, the goal
of the moderator

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:18.560
is to take neutrons from high
energies like 1 to 10 MeV

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:20.990
where the fission cross
section is relatively low

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:23.810
and slow them down into this
region where fission is,

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:26.840
let's say, 1,000
times more likely.

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:29.030
And in a light water
reactor in the US,

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:32.120
if the coolant goes away,
so does the moderation.

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:34.910
And there's nothing left
to slow those neutrons down

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:36.620
to make fission more likely.

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:39.510
In the RBMK, that's
not the case.

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:41.150
The graphite is still there.

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:44.930
The graphite is cooled by
a helium-nitrogen mixture

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:47.990
because the neutron interactions
in the graphite that's slowing

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:48.688
down--

00:06:48.688 --> 00:06:51.230
we've always talked about what
happens from the point of view

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:52.370
of the neutron.

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:54.950
But what about the point of
view of the other material?

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:57.740
Any energy lost by
the neutrons is gained

00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:59.510
by the moderating material.

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:02.270
So the graphite gets really hot.

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:05.360
And you have to flow some
non-oxygen-containing gas

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:07.370
mixture like helium
and nitrogen, which

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:10.730
is pretty inert, to
keep that graphite cool.

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:13.460
And then in between
the graphite moderator

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:17.060
were control rods, about 200
of them or so, 30 of which

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:20.570
were required to be down in
the reactor at any given time

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:21.750
in order to control power.

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:23.390
And that was a design rule.

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:26.810
That was broken during
the actual experiment.

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:29.840
And then on top of here, on
top of this biological shield,

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:31.550
you could walk on top of it.

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:33.350
So the tops of those
pressure tubes,

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:37.080
despite being about 350
kilo chunks of concrete,

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:38.330
you could walk on top of them.

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:42.460
That's pretty cool,
kind of scary too.

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:46.770
So what happened in
chronological order was,

00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:51.270
around midnight, the decision
was made to undergo this test

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:53.610
and start spinning
down the turbine.

00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:57.360
But the grid operator came back
and said, no, you can't just

00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:59.280
cut the reactor
power to nothing.

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:02.010
You have to maintain at a
rather high power for a while,

00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:05.430
about 500 megawatts electric
or half the rated power

00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:06.690
of the reactor.

00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:08.640
And what that had
the effect of doing

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:13.980
is continuing to create fission
products, including xenon-135.

00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:16.620
We haven't mentioned
this one yet.

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:22.440
You'll talk about it quite a
lot in 22.05 in neutron physics.

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:25.800
Black shirt really
shows chalk well.

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:28.160
What xenon-135 does
is it just sits there.

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:29.540
It's a noble gas.

00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:31.070
It has a half-life
of a few days.

00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:36.380
So it decays on the slow side
for as fission products go.

00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:41.220
But it also absorbs lots and
lots and lots of neutrons.

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:43.950
Let's see if I could find
which one is the xenon one.

00:08:43.950 --> 00:08:45.100
There we go.

00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:48.120
So here, I've plotted
the total cross-section

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:52.500
for xenon-135 and the
absorption cross-section.

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:54.690
And notice how,
for low energies,

00:08:54.690 --> 00:08:56.580
pretty much the entire
cross section of xenon

00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:58.042
is made up of absorption.

00:08:58.042 --> 00:09:00.000
Did you guys in your
homework see anything that

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.030
reached about 10 million barns?

00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:03.970
No.

00:09:03.970 --> 00:09:06.850
Xenon-135 is one of the best
neutron absorbers there is.

00:09:06.850 --> 00:09:09.130
And reactors produce
it constantly.

00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:12.820
So as they're operating,
you build up xenon-135

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:16.270
that you have to account for
in your sigma absorption cross

00:09:16.270 --> 00:09:17.910
section.

00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:20.440
Because like you guys
saw in the homework,

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:22.690
if you want to write what's
the sigma absorption cross

00:09:22.690 --> 00:09:26.460
section of the
reactor, it's the sum

00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:29.910
of every single isotope in
the reactor of its number

00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:34.740
density times its
absorption cross section.

00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:39.430
And so that would include
everything for water

00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:42.570
and let's say the
uranium and the xenon

00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:44.130
that you're building up.

00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:47.010
When the reactor starts up,
the number density of xenon

00:09:47.010 --> 00:09:50.730
is 0 because you don't have
anything to have produced it.

00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:53.850
When you start operating, you'll
reach the xenon equilibrium

00:09:53.850 --> 00:09:57.210
level where it will build
to a certain level that

00:09:57.210 --> 00:10:00.960
will counteract the
reactivity of the reactor.

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:03.210
And then your
k-effective expression,

00:10:03.210 --> 00:10:11.170
where it sources over
absorption plus leakage,

00:10:11.170 --> 00:10:14.830
this has the effect of
raising sigma absorption

00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:17.440
and lowering k effective.

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:19.510
The trick is it doesn't
last for very long.

00:10:19.510 --> 00:10:22.670
It built decays with a
half-life of about five days.

00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:24.580
And when you try and
raise the reactor power,

00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:26.900
you will also start
to burn it out.

00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:29.350
So if you're operating at
a fairly low power level,

00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:32.325
you'll both be decaying
and burning xenon

00:10:32.325 --> 00:10:33.950
without really knowing
what's going on.

00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:36.050
And that's exactly
what happened here.

00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:37.775
So an hour or so later--

00:10:37.775 --> 00:10:40.515
let me pull up the
chronology again.

00:10:40.515 --> 00:10:41.890
A little more than
an hour later,

00:10:41.890 --> 00:10:45.970
so the reactor power stabilized
at something like 30 megawatts.

00:10:45.970 --> 00:10:47.810
And they were like,
what is going on?

00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:49.420
Why is that reactor
power so low?

00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:51.250
We need to increase
the reactor power.

00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:52.430
So what did they do?

00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:53.690
A couple of things.

00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:57.460
One was remove all but six
or seven of the control rods

00:10:57.460 --> 00:11:01.570
going way outside the
spec of the design

00:11:01.570 --> 00:11:03.520
because 30 were needed
to actually maintain

00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:05.350
the reactor at a stable power.

00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:08.710
All the while, the xenon
that had been building up

00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:11.500
is still there keeping the
reactor from going critical.

00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:14.410
It's what was the main reason
that the reactor didn't even

00:11:14.410 --> 00:11:16.150
have very much power.

00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:18.860
But it was also burning
out at the same time.

00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:20.780
So all the while--

00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:25.930
let's say if we were to show
a graph of two things, time,

00:11:25.930 --> 00:11:30.700
xenon inventory,
and as a solid line

00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:37.430
and let's say control rod
worth as a dotted line.

00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:39.750
The xenon inventory
at full power

00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:41.490
would have been at some level.

00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:45.020
And then it would start
to decay and burn out.

00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:46.560
While at the same
time, the control

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:51.362
rod worth, as you remove
control rods from the reactor--

00:11:51.362 --> 00:11:53.820
every time you remove one, you
lose some control rod worth,

00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:58.560
would continue to diminish
leading to the point where

00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:02.010
bad stuff is going to happen.

00:12:02.010 --> 00:12:04.680
Let me make sure I
didn't lose my place.

00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:08.040
So at any rate, as they started
pulling the control rods out,

00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:10.800
a couple of interesting quirks
happened in terms of feedback.

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:12.990
So let's look back
at this design.

00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:15.960
Like any reactor,
this reactor had

00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:18.990
what's called a negative
fuel temperature coefficient.

00:12:18.990 --> 00:12:22.530
What that means is that,
when you heat up the fuel,

00:12:22.530 --> 00:12:23.940
two things happen.

00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:26.640
One, the cross section
for anything, absorption

00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:28.290
or fission, would go up.

00:12:28.290 --> 00:12:30.990
But the number density
would also go down.

00:12:30.990 --> 00:12:34.170
As the atoms physically
spaced out in the fuel,

00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:35.730
their number density
would go down,

00:12:35.730 --> 00:12:39.000
lowering the macroscopic
cross section for fission.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.250
And that's arguably
a good thing.

00:12:41.250 --> 00:12:45.120
The problem is, at
below about 20% power,

00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:48.210
of the reactor had what's called
a positive void coefficient,

00:12:48.210 --> 00:12:50.850
which meant that, if
you boil the coolant,

00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:53.380
you increase the reactor power.

00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:54.630
Because the other thing that--

00:12:54.630 --> 00:12:56.560
I think I mentioned this once.

00:12:56.560 --> 00:13:01.175
And you calculated in the
homework the absorption cross

00:13:01.175 --> 00:13:05.420
section of hydrogen is not 0.

00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:08.120
It's small, but
fairly significant.

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:09.740
Let's actually
take a look at it.

00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:12.850
We can always see this in JANIS.

00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:18.280
Go back down to
hydrogen, hydrogen-1.

00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:21.230
Then we look at the
absorption cross section.

00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:26.770
And of course, it started
us with the linear scale.

00:13:26.770 --> 00:13:28.140
Let's go logarithmic.

00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:28.780
Oh!

00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:30.040
OK!

00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:33.640
So at low energy, at 10 to the
minus 8 to 10 to the minus 7,

00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:35.950
it's around a barn.

00:13:35.950 --> 00:13:39.143
Not super high, but
absolutely not negligible,

00:13:39.143 --> 00:13:41.185
which meant that part of
the normal functionality

00:13:41.185 --> 00:13:46.865
of the RBMK depended on the
absorption of the water to help

00:13:46.865 --> 00:13:48.115
absorb some of those neutrons.

00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:54.250
With that water gone,
there was less absorption.

00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:57.790
But there was still a ton of
moderation in this graphite

00:13:57.790 --> 00:13:58.712
moderator.

00:13:58.712 --> 00:13:59.920
So they still could get slow.

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:01.295
But then there'd
be more of them.

00:14:01.295 --> 00:14:03.400
And that would cause
the power to increase.

00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:05.680
And then that caused
more of the coolant

00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:09.130
to boil, which would cause
less absorption, which would

00:14:09.130 --> 00:14:10.387
cause the power to increase.

00:14:10.387 --> 00:14:10.970
Yeah, Charlie?

00:14:10.970 --> 00:14:14.447
AUDIENCE: So did they remove
the water from the reactor?

00:14:14.447 --> 00:14:16.280
MICHAEL SHORT: They did
not remove the water

00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:16.988
from the reactor.

00:14:16.988 --> 00:14:20.270
However, as the power started
to rise, some of the water

00:14:20.270 --> 00:14:22.360
started to boil.

00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:25.750
And so you can still have,
let's say, steam flowing through

00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:27.190
and still remove
some of the heat.

00:14:27.190 --> 00:14:29.920
However, you don't have
that dense or water

00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:31.710
to act as an absorber.

00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:33.460
And that's what really
undid this reactor.

00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:35.950
In addition, they
decided to disable

00:14:35.950 --> 00:14:39.330
the ECCS, or the Emergency
Core Cooling System,

00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:41.130
which you're just
not supposed to do.

00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:42.880
So they shut down a
bunch of these systems

00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:44.547
to see if you could
power the other ones

00:14:44.547 --> 00:14:46.120
from the spinning down turbine.

00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:48.753
And then, as they noticed
that the reactor was

00:14:48.753 --> 00:14:50.170
getting less and
less stable, they

00:14:50.170 --> 00:14:52.840
had almost all the rods out.

00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:57.400
Some of these pressure tubes
started to bump and jump.

00:14:57.400 --> 00:15:02.380
These 350-kilogram pressure
tube caps were just rattling.

00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:04.780
I mean, imagine
something that weighs 900

00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:07.000
pounds or so rattling around.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.225
And there's a few
hundred of them.

00:15:09.225 --> 00:15:11.350
So there was someone in
the control room that said,

00:15:11.350 --> 00:15:12.640
the caps are rattling.

00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:14.166
What the heck?

00:15:14.166 --> 00:15:16.840
And didn't quite make it
down the spiral staircase

00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:21.560
because, about 10 seconds
later, everything went wrong.

00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:23.490
And so I want to pull
up this actual timeline

00:15:23.490 --> 00:15:27.330
so you can see it splits
from minutes to seconds.

00:15:27.330 --> 00:15:30.840
Because the speed at which
this stuff started to go wrong

00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:33.230
was pretty striking.

00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:38.600
So for example, the control rods
raised at 1:19 in the morning.

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:41.750
Two minutes later, when
the power starts to become

00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:44.240
unstable, the caps on the
fuel channels-- which, again,

00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:46.730
are like 350-kilogram blocks--

00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:48.940
start jumping in their sockets.

00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:50.450
And a lot of that was--

00:15:50.450 --> 00:15:53.330
we go back to the RBMK reactor.

00:15:53.330 --> 00:15:56.030
As the coolant started
to boil here, well,

00:15:56.030 --> 00:15:58.580
that boiling force actually
creates huge pressure

00:15:58.580 --> 00:16:00.740
instabilities, which
would cause the pressure

00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:03.530
tubes to jump up and
down, eventually rupturing

00:16:03.530 --> 00:16:06.950
almost every single one of
them with enough force to shoot

00:16:06.950 --> 00:16:09.980
these 350-kilogram caps.

00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:12.050
And what did they say?

00:16:12.050 --> 00:16:14.720
I like the language
that they used--

00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:16.610
jumping in their sockets.

00:16:16.610 --> 00:16:20.477
So 50 seconds later,
pressure fails

00:16:20.477 --> 00:16:22.310
in the steam drums,
which means there's been

00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:24.050
some sort of containment leak.

00:16:24.050 --> 00:16:27.260
So all the while, the
coolant was boiling.

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:28.970
The absorption was going down.

00:16:28.970 --> 00:16:30.620
The power was going up.

00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:32.270
Repeat, repeat, repeat.

00:16:32.270 --> 00:16:35.380
And the power jumped to about
100 times the rated power

00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:37.840
in something like four seconds.

00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:39.910
So it was normally
1,000-megawatt electric

00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:42.610
reactor, which is about
3,200 megawatts thermal.

00:16:42.610 --> 00:16:47.320
It was producing
nearly half a terawatt

00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:50.380
of thermal power for a
very short amount of time

00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:52.103
until it exploded.

00:16:52.103 --> 00:16:53.020
Now, it's interesting.

00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:55.450
A lot of folks call Chernobyl
a nuclear explosion.

00:16:55.450 --> 00:16:57.220
That's actually a misnomer.

00:16:57.220 --> 00:17:00.940
A nuclear explosion would be
a nuclear weapon, something

00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:04.359
set off by an enormous chain
reaction principally heated

00:17:04.359 --> 00:17:06.579
by fission or fusion.

00:17:06.579 --> 00:17:09.099
That's not actually what
happened at Chernobyl,

00:17:09.099 --> 00:17:12.670
nor at Fukushima, nor was that
the worry at Three Mile Island.

00:17:12.670 --> 00:17:15.160
Not to say it wasn't
a horrible thing,

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:17.950
but it wasn't an actual
nuclear explosion.

00:17:17.950 --> 00:17:21.730
At first, what happened
was a pressure explosion.

00:17:21.730 --> 00:17:25.089
So there was an enormous
release of steam

00:17:25.089 --> 00:17:29.560
as the power built up to 100
times normal operating power.

00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:31.810
The steam force was so
large that it actually

00:17:31.810 --> 00:17:35.820
blew the reactor lid
up off of the thing.

00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:38.770
And I think I have a picture
of that somewhere here too.

00:17:41.710 --> 00:17:43.220
It should be further down.

00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:46.340
Yeah, to give you a
little sense of scale.

00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:48.680
The reactor cover, which
weighed about 1,000 tons,

00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:52.430
launched into the air and
landed above the reactor

00:17:52.430 --> 00:17:54.380
sending most of the
reactor components

00:17:54.380 --> 00:17:56.600
up to a kilometer up in the air.

00:17:56.600 --> 00:18:00.170
Four seconds later,
that was followed

00:18:00.170 --> 00:18:02.630
by a hydrogen explosion.

00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:05.050
Let me get that down
to that chronology.

00:18:05.050 --> 00:18:07.550
So yeah.

00:18:07.550 --> 00:18:10.340
At 1:23 and 40 seconds
in the morning--

00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:10.840
oh, yeah.

00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:13.382
So I should mentioned why this
happened-- emergency insertion

00:18:13.382 --> 00:18:15.690
of all the control rods.

00:18:15.690 --> 00:18:18.240
The last part that this diagram
doesn't mention is these

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:20.550
control rods-- and I'll
draw this up here--

00:18:20.550 --> 00:18:24.030
we're tipped with about
six inches of graphite.

00:18:24.030 --> 00:18:26.530
So if these were two
graphite channels--

00:18:26.530 --> 00:18:29.320
let's say these are carbon--

00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:31.620
and this is your
control rod, the goal

00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:37.200
was to get this control rod
all the way into the reactor.

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:39.660
One part they didn't
mention was they

00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:42.450
were tipped with about six
inches of graphite, which

00:18:42.450 --> 00:18:45.210
only functions as
additional moderator.

00:18:45.210 --> 00:18:48.450
Graphite is one of the
lowest absorbing materials

00:18:48.450 --> 00:18:51.970
in the periodic table, second,
I think, only to oxygen.

00:18:51.970 --> 00:18:57.200
And if we pull up
graphite cross sections,

00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:59.850
I've plotted here the
total cross section,

00:18:59.850 --> 00:19:01.440
the elastic scattering
cross section.

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:05.430
And down here, in
the 0.001 barn level,

00:19:05.430 --> 00:19:08.670
is the absorption cross
section, about 1,000 times lower

00:19:08.670 --> 00:19:09.510
than water.

00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:12.120
So you're shoving more material
in the reactor that slows down

00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:14.070
neutrons even
more, bringing them

00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:17.220
into the high-fission region
without absorbing anything.

00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:19.560
And they jammed
about halfway down,

00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:23.010
about 2 and 1/2 feet down,
leaving the extra graphite

00:19:23.010 --> 00:19:24.940
right in the center
of the core where

00:19:24.940 --> 00:19:26.510
it could do the most damage.

00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:28.050
And it didn't take
that much time.

00:19:28.050 --> 00:19:28.770
Yeah?

00:19:28.770 --> 00:19:31.410
AUDIENCE: So my understanding is
that, also, one of the designs

00:19:31.410 --> 00:19:34.270
is that the control rods
didn't immediately drop down.

00:19:34.270 --> 00:19:35.510
But they were slowly lowered.

00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:36.570
MICHAEL SHORT: Yep.

00:19:36.570 --> 00:19:38.205
They took 7 to 10 seconds.

00:19:38.205 --> 00:19:40.330
AUDIENCE: If they had a
system where they did drop,

00:19:40.330 --> 00:19:42.120
would that have
possibly actually set

00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:43.173
the system down properly?

00:19:43.173 --> 00:19:44.340
MICHAEL SHORT: I'm not sure.

00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:47.160
I don't know whether lowering
control rods into something

00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:49.380
that was undergoing
steam explosions

00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:50.610
would have actually helped.

00:19:50.610 --> 00:19:52.527
I mean, to me, by this
point, it was all over.

00:19:54.930 --> 00:19:59.732
So the extra moderator
that was dumped in

00:19:59.732 --> 00:20:01.440
was the last kick in
the pants this thing

00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:04.310
needed to go absolutely insane.

00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:07.370
And if we go back to the
timeline on the second level,

00:20:07.370 --> 00:20:11.090
control rods inserted
at 1:23 and 40 seconds.

00:20:11.090 --> 00:20:16.160
Explosion, four seconds later,
to 120 times full power,

00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:18.260
getting towards
a terawatt or so.

00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:22.760
One second later, the 1,000-ton
lid launches off from the first

00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:24.670
explosion.

00:20:24.670 --> 00:20:28.000
Very shortly after
that, second explosion.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:32.100
And that happened
because of this reaction.

00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:37.350
Well, just about anything
corroding with water

00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:41.380
will make pretty
much anything oxide

00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:44.500
plus hydrogen, the same
chemical explosion that

00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:47.212
was the undoing of
Fukushima and was the worry

00:20:47.212 --> 00:20:49.420
at Three Mile Island that
there was a hydrogen bubble

00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:52.242
building because of
corrosion reactions

00:20:52.242 --> 00:20:53.950
with whatever happened
to be in the core.

00:20:53.950 --> 00:20:56.620
This happens with zirconium
pretty vigorously.

00:20:56.620 --> 00:20:58.750
But it happens with
other materials too.

00:20:58.750 --> 00:21:01.330
If you oxidize
something with water,

00:21:01.330 --> 00:21:04.060
you leave behind the
hydrogen. And the hydrogen,

00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:07.030
in a very wide range of
concentrations in the air,

00:21:07.030 --> 00:21:08.440
is explosive.

00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:11.890
We're actually not allowed
to use hydrogen at about 4%

00:21:11.890 --> 00:21:14.530
in any of the labs here because
that reaches the flammability

00:21:14.530 --> 00:21:16.120
or explosive limit.

00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:19.510
So for my PhD, we were
doing these experiments

00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:22.000
corroding materials
in liquid lead.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:23.770
And we wanted to
dump in pure hydrogen

00:21:23.770 --> 00:21:27.040
to see what happens when
there's no oxygen. We were told,

00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:28.082
absolutely not.

00:21:28.082 --> 00:21:30.040
We had to drill a hole
in the side of the walls

00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:32.890
that the hydrogen would
vent outside and do

00:21:32.890 --> 00:21:35.500
some calculations to show if
the entire bottle of hydrogen

00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:37.750
emptied into the lab
at once, which it could

00:21:37.750 --> 00:21:40.150
do if the cap of the
bottle breaks off,

00:21:40.150 --> 00:21:42.970
it would not reach
4% concentration.

00:21:42.970 --> 00:21:45.260
So hydrogen explosions are
pretty powerful things.

00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:49.000
You guys ever seen people
making water from scratch?

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:52.733
Mix hydrogen and oxygen in
a bottle and light a match?

00:21:52.733 --> 00:21:54.900
We've got a video of it
circulating somewhere around

00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:58.020
here because for RTC, for the
Reactor Technology Course,

00:21:58.020 --> 00:21:59.670
I do this in front
of a bunch of CEOs

00:21:59.670 --> 00:22:02.910
and watch them jump out of their
chairs to teach basic chemical

00:22:02.910 --> 00:22:03.520
reactions.

00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:06.390
But it's pretty loud.

00:22:06.390 --> 00:22:10.010
About enough hydrogen and
oxygen to just fill this cup

00:22:10.010 --> 00:22:11.460
or fill a half-liter
water bottle

00:22:11.460 --> 00:22:13.560
makes a bang that gets
your ears ringing.

00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:16.303
Not quite bleeding,
but close enough.

00:22:16.303 --> 00:22:18.220
So that's what happened
here, except at a much

00:22:18.220 --> 00:22:19.180
more massive scale.

00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:21.160
So there was a steam
explosion followed

00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:24.970
seconds later by a hydrogen
explosion from hydrogen

00:22:24.970 --> 00:22:27.370
liberated from the corrosion
reaction of everything

00:22:27.370 --> 00:22:29.800
with the water that
was already there.

00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:35.930
And that's when this happened.

00:22:35.930 --> 00:22:36.650

MICHAEL SHORT: So
that smoke right there

00:22:57.100 --> 00:23:01.470
is from a graphite
fire, not normal smoke.

00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:20.800

00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:22.135
Spoke too soon.

[END PLAYBACK]

00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:55.492
MICHAEL SHORT: This actually
provides a perfect conduit

00:23:55.492 --> 00:23:58.360
to transition from the second to
the third parts of this course.

00:23:58.360 --> 00:23:59.650
A lot of you have been
waiting to find out

00:23:59.650 --> 00:24:01.108
what are the units
of dose and what

00:24:01.108 --> 00:24:03.795
are the biological and
chemical effects of radiation.

00:24:03.795 --> 00:24:05.170
Well, this is
where you get them.

00:24:05.170 --> 00:24:07.660
From neutron physics,
you can understand

00:24:07.660 --> 00:24:09.397
why Chernobyl went wrong.

00:24:09.397 --> 00:24:11.980
Honestly, you've just been doing
this for three or four weeks.

00:24:11.980 --> 00:24:14.740
But with your knowledge of cross
sections, reactor feedback,

00:24:14.740 --> 00:24:17.680
and criticality, you can start
to understand why Chernobyl

00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:18.942
was flawed in its design.

00:24:18.942 --> 00:24:21.400
And what we're going to teach
you in the rest of the course

00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:24.580
is what happens next, what
happens when radio nuclides are

00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:26.860
absorbed by animals
of the human body,

00:24:26.860 --> 00:24:29.680
and what was the
main fallout, let's

00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:34.240
say, in the colloquial
sense and the actual sense

00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:36.798
from the Chernobyl reactor.

00:24:36.798 --> 00:24:37.465
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:24:37.465 --> 00:24:40.070
Let's look a bit at what
they did next though.

00:24:40.070 --> 00:25:45.898
- [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:25:45.898 --> 00:25:47.440
MICHAEL SHORT: That's
not quite true.

00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:48.190
You'll see why.

00:25:48.190 --> 00:25:58.573
- [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:25:58.573 --> 00:26:00.240
MICHAEL SHORT: That
actually did happen.

- [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:26:08.027 --> 00:26:08.610
[END PLAYBACK]

00:26:08.610 --> 00:26:10.693
MICHAEL SHORT: I think
that pretty much summarizes

00:26:10.693 --> 00:26:12.420
the state of things now.

00:26:12.420 --> 00:26:15.690
They built a sarcophagus around
this reactor, a gigantic tomb,

00:26:15.690 --> 00:26:17.700
which, according
to some reports,

00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:20.010
is not that structurally
sound and is

00:26:20.010 --> 00:26:22.590
in danger of partial collapse.

00:26:22.590 --> 00:26:25.350
So yeah, more difficult
efforts are ahead.

00:26:25.350 --> 00:26:28.993
But let's now talk about
what happened next.

00:26:28.993 --> 00:26:31.480
I'm going to jump to
the very end of this.

00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:35.860
The actual way that the accident
was noticed was the spread

00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:41.890
of the radioactive cloud
to not-so-close-by Sweden.

00:26:41.890 --> 00:26:44.840
So it was noticed that folks
entering a reactor in Sweden

00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:46.840
had contaminants on them,
which they thought was

00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:48.090
coming from their own reactor.

00:26:48.090 --> 00:26:49.192
Good first assumption.

00:26:49.192 --> 00:26:50.650
When it was determined
that nothing

00:26:50.650 --> 00:26:52.960
was amiss at the
reactor in Sweden,

00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:54.760
folks started to
analyze wind patterns

00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:55.900
and find out what happened.

00:26:55.900 --> 00:26:57.910
And then it was
clear that the USSR

00:26:57.910 --> 00:27:00.430
had tried to cover up
the Chernobyl accident.

00:27:00.430 --> 00:27:02.190
But you can't cover up fallout.

00:27:02.190 --> 00:27:05.950
And it eventually
spread pretty wide,

00:27:05.950 --> 00:27:08.440
covering most of
Europe and Russia

00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:11.230
and surprisingly not
Spain, lucky them

00:27:11.230 --> 00:27:14.780
for the wind patterns that
day, or those few days.

00:27:14.780 --> 00:27:18.630
So what happened is a few days
after the actual accident,

00:27:18.630 --> 00:27:20.530
a graphite fire
started to break out.

00:27:20.530 --> 00:27:23.410
Because graphite, when
exposed to air, well,

00:27:23.410 --> 00:27:25.420
you can do the chemistry.

00:27:25.420 --> 00:27:32.390
Add graphite plus oxygen, you
start making carbon dioxide.

00:27:32.390 --> 00:27:34.130
So graphite burns when it's hot.

00:27:34.130 --> 00:27:35.640
And as you can see
from the video--

00:27:39.210 --> 00:27:43.460
where is that nice still
of burning graphite?

00:27:43.460 --> 00:27:43.992
Yeah.

00:27:43.992 --> 00:27:45.200
That graphite was pretty hot.

00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:48.050
So a lot of that smoke
included burning graphite

00:27:48.050 --> 00:27:51.290
and a lot of the materials
from the reactor itself.

00:27:51.290 --> 00:27:54.230
Now, when you build up
fission products in a reactor

00:27:54.230 --> 00:27:55.952
and they get
volatilized like this,

00:27:55.952 --> 00:27:57.410
the ones that tend
to get out first

00:27:57.410 --> 00:27:59.550
would be things like
the noble gases.

00:27:59.550 --> 00:28:02.630
So the whole xenon inventory
of the reactor was released.

00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:04.931
It's estimated at about 100%.

00:28:04.931 --> 00:28:08.640
And I can actually
pull up those figures.

00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:11.520
When we talk about how
much of which radionuclide

00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:13.200
was released.

00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:14.220
That's also a typo.

00:28:14.220 --> 00:28:17.670
If somebody wants to call in,
there's no 33 isotope of xenon.

00:28:17.670 --> 00:28:20.312
It's supposed to be 133.

00:28:20.312 --> 00:28:22.520
That would be interesting
if someone wants to call in

00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:24.560
and say the NEA
has got a mistake.

00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:27.000
So 100% of the
inventory released.

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.450
That should be pretty obvious
because it's a noble gas.

00:28:29.450 --> 00:28:31.280
And it just kind of floats away.

00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:37.700
The real dangers, though, came
from iodine-131, about 50%

00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:41.370
of a 3-exabecquerel activity.

00:28:41.370 --> 00:28:43.490
So we're talking
like megacuries.

00:28:43.490 --> 00:28:44.255
It might be giga.

00:28:44.255 --> 00:28:46.160
I can't do that math in my head.

00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:47.600
A lot of radiation.

00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:49.490
The problem with that
is iodine behaves

00:28:49.490 --> 00:28:53.060
just like any other
halogen. It forms salts.

00:28:53.060 --> 00:28:54.025
It's rather volatile.

00:28:54.025 --> 00:28:57.610
Have any of you guys
played with iodine before?

00:28:57.610 --> 00:28:58.760
No one does-- oh, you have.

00:28:58.760 --> 00:28:59.260
OK.

00:28:59.260 --> 00:29:00.718
What happens when
you play with it?

00:29:00.718 --> 00:29:03.658
AUDIENCE: I mean, just
throw some stuff--

00:29:03.658 --> 00:29:08.423
like, it turns everything
yellow and it just

00:29:08.423 --> 00:29:10.560
reacts with acids and stuff.

00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:12.320
I haven't really done
very much with it.

00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:12.820
So--

00:29:12.820 --> 00:29:13.850
MICHAEL SHORT: OK.

00:29:13.850 --> 00:29:15.730
I happen to have
extensive practice playing

00:29:15.730 --> 00:29:17.800
with iodine in my home because
I did all the stuff you're not

00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:20.230
supposed to do as a kid, kind
of build your own chemistry

00:29:20.230 --> 00:29:23.260
stuff things that somehow leak
out to your local high school

00:29:23.260 --> 00:29:24.460
somehow.

00:29:24.460 --> 00:29:27.180
Iodine's pretty neat.

00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:29.770
Yeah, it happens sometimes.

00:29:29.770 --> 00:29:32.680
If you put iodine in your
hand, it actually sublimes.

00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:34.990
The heat from your hand
is enough to directly go

00:29:34.990 --> 00:29:36.910
from solid to vapor.

00:29:36.910 --> 00:29:39.797
And so the iodine was
also quite volatile.

00:29:39.797 --> 00:29:42.130
Some of it may have been in
the form of other compounds.

00:29:42.130 --> 00:29:43.840
Some of it may have
been elemental--

00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:44.740
probably not likely.

00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:46.930
But there was certainly
some iodine vapor.

00:29:46.930 --> 00:29:48.790
And about half of
that was released.

00:29:48.790 --> 00:29:51.820
The problem is then
it condenses out

00:29:51.820 --> 00:29:56.230
and falls on anything green,
anything with surface area.

00:29:56.230 --> 00:29:58.900
So the biggest danger to
the folks living nearby

00:29:58.900 --> 00:30:03.460
was from eating leafy
vegetables because leaves

00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:04.630
got lots of surface area.

00:30:04.630 --> 00:30:06.280
Iodine deposits on them.

00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:09.010
And it's intensely
radioactive for a month or so.

00:30:09.010 --> 00:30:11.290
Or depositing on the
grass that cows eat,

00:30:11.290 --> 00:30:14.230
which led to the problem
of radioactive milk.

00:30:14.230 --> 00:30:16.450
And so that's why milk
in the Soviet Union

00:30:16.450 --> 00:30:18.370
was banned for such a
long time because this

00:30:18.370 --> 00:30:22.260
was one of the major sources
of iodine contamination.

00:30:22.260 --> 00:30:24.330
The other one, which
we're worrying about now

00:30:24.330 --> 00:30:27.810
from Fukushima as
well, is cesium,

00:30:27.810 --> 00:30:30.750
which has similar chemistry to
sodium and potassium-- again,

00:30:30.750 --> 00:30:34.530
a rather salty compound,
or rather salty element.

00:30:34.530 --> 00:30:37.360
But it's got a
half-life of 30 years.

00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:40.460
And if we look it up in
the table of nuclides,

00:30:40.460 --> 00:30:42.580
we'll see what it
actually releases.

00:30:42.580 --> 00:30:43.080
Oh, good.

00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:45.500
It's back online.

00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:49.100
Anyone else notice this
broken a couple days ago.

00:30:49.100 --> 00:30:49.972
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:30:49.972 --> 00:30:52.180
MICHAEL SHORT: Well, luckily,
Brookhaven National Lab

00:30:52.180 --> 00:30:53.940
has a good version up too.

00:30:53.940 --> 00:30:57.860
But let's grab cesium.

00:30:57.860 --> 00:31:00.140
Yeah, there's plenty out there.

00:31:00.140 --> 00:31:02.360
Cesium-137.

00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:05.510
Beta decays to barium but
also gives off gamma rays.

00:31:05.510 --> 00:31:09.260
And most of the decays
end up giving off

00:31:09.260 --> 00:31:13.400
one of those gamma rays,
let's say a 660-keV gamma ray.

00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:15.870
So it's both a beta
and a gamma emitter.

00:31:15.870 --> 00:31:17.480
Now, which of those
types of radiation

00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:21.050
do you think it's more damaging
to biological organisms?

00:31:21.050 --> 00:31:23.096
The beta or the gamma?

00:31:23.096 --> 00:31:24.052
AUDIENCE: Gamma?

00:31:24.052 --> 00:31:25.427
MICHAEL SHORT:
You say the gamma.

00:31:25.427 --> 00:31:26.663
Why do you say so?

00:31:26.663 --> 00:31:28.080
AUDIENCE: Doesn't
beta get stopped

00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:29.690
by the skin and clothing?

00:31:29.690 --> 00:31:30.800
MICHAEL SHORT: It does.

00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:32.715
But if cesium is
better known as--

00:31:32.715 --> 00:31:33.590
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:33.590 --> 00:31:35.540
MICHAEL SHORT: Yes.

00:31:35.540 --> 00:31:36.500
That's right.

00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:38.980
So did I get to tell
you guys this question,

00:31:38.980 --> 00:31:42.070
the four cookies question?

00:31:42.070 --> 00:31:42.920
Yeah.

00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:45.117
You eat the gamma cookie
because most gammas that

00:31:45.117 --> 00:31:47.450
are emitted by the cookie
simply leave you and irradiate

00:31:47.450 --> 00:31:51.330
your friend, which is going to
be the topic of pset number 8.

00:31:51.330 --> 00:31:51.960
You'll see.

00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:54.360
That's why you guys are
getting your whole body counts.

00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:58.910
Speaking of, who's gotten
their whole body counts at EHS?

00:31:58.910 --> 00:31:59.410
Awesome.

00:31:59.410 --> 00:32:00.850
So that's almost everybody.

00:32:00.850 --> 00:32:03.130
You will need that
data for problem set 8.

00:32:03.130 --> 00:32:06.067
So do schedule it soon,
preferably before Thanksgiving

00:32:06.067 --> 00:32:07.900
so that you'll be able
to take a look at it.

00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:12.440
Has anyone found anything
interesting in your spectra?

00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:14.300
Good.

00:32:14.300 --> 00:32:16.010
Glad to hear that.

00:32:16.010 --> 00:32:18.860
But you do see a potassium
peak that you can probably

00:32:18.860 --> 00:32:22.650
integrate and do some
problems with, right?

00:32:22.650 --> 00:32:23.890
Yeah, because you will.

00:32:23.890 --> 00:32:24.930
OK.

00:32:24.930 --> 00:32:25.980
Anyway, yeah.

00:32:25.980 --> 00:32:26.882
It's the betas.

00:32:26.882 --> 00:32:27.840
That's the real killer.

00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:31.680
The gammas are going to leave
the cesium, enter your body,

00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:33.780
and most likely come
out the other side.

00:32:33.780 --> 00:32:39.240
Because the mass attenuation
coefficient of 6-- what is it?

00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:41.910
Water for 660-keV gammas.

00:32:41.910 --> 00:32:45.040
Let's find that.

00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:46.540
Table 3.

00:32:46.540 --> 00:32:49.180
Let's say you're
made mostly of water.

00:32:53.420 --> 00:32:57.040
Water, liquid, that's
pretty much humans.

00:32:57.040 --> 00:33:01.810
660 keV is right about
here leading to about 0.1

00:33:01.810 --> 00:33:03.760
centimeter squared per gram.

00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:05.470
And with a density
of 1 gram, that's

00:33:05.470 --> 00:33:08.300
a pretty low
attenuation of gammas.

00:33:08.300 --> 00:33:10.150
So this chart actually
shows why most

00:33:10.150 --> 00:33:12.988
of the cesium gammas that would
be produced from ingestion

00:33:12.988 --> 00:33:13.780
just get right out.

00:33:13.780 --> 00:33:17.680
But it's the betas that
have an awfully short range.

00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:22.050
Anyone remember the formula
for range in general?

00:33:22.050 --> 00:33:24.910
So this is going to come back
up in our discussion of dose

00:33:24.910 --> 00:33:25.870
and biological effects.

00:33:30.070 --> 00:33:36.355
Integral, yep, of stopping
power to the negative 1.

00:33:36.355 --> 00:33:40.435
And that's stopping power
is this simple formula.

00:33:49.300 --> 00:33:50.640
Let's see.

00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:52.580
What did that come out as?

00:33:57.580 --> 00:33:59.600
Log minus beta squared.

00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:01.905
That simple little
formula, which

00:34:01.905 --> 00:34:03.780
I'm not going to expect
you guys to memorize.

00:34:03.780 --> 00:34:05.220
So don't worry about it.

00:34:05.220 --> 00:34:07.850
But if you integrate
this, you find out

00:34:07.850 --> 00:34:10.880
that the range of electrons,
even 1 MeV electrons, in water

00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:11.989
is not very high.

00:34:11.989 --> 00:34:15.500
So most of them are stopped
near or by the cells

00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:19.820
that absorb them doing quite
a bit of damage to DNA, which

00:34:19.820 --> 00:34:22.370
is eventually what causes
mutagenic effects--

00:34:22.370 --> 00:34:24.400
cancer, cell death,
what we're going

00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:28.639
to talk about for the whole
third part of the course.

00:34:28.639 --> 00:34:32.449
There's also a worry about
which organs actually

00:34:32.449 --> 00:34:34.460
absorb these radionuclides.

00:34:34.460 --> 00:34:37.580
And iodine in particular
is preferentially

00:34:37.580 --> 00:34:39.633
absorbed by the thyroid.

00:34:39.633 --> 00:34:41.300
So when we started
looking at the amount

00:34:41.300 --> 00:34:43.820
of radioactive
substances released--

00:34:43.820 --> 00:34:47.179
remember they said, OK, at
around the 26th of April

00:34:47.179 --> 00:34:50.480
or the 2nd of May or so
the release was stopped?

00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:52.070
Not according to our data.

00:34:52.070 --> 00:34:54.350
That's when the graphite
fire picked up again.

00:34:54.350 --> 00:34:57.600
In addition, the
core of Chernobyl,

00:34:57.600 --> 00:35:01.550
which had undergone a
mostly total meltdown,

00:35:01.550 --> 00:35:07.700
was sitting in a pool on
top of this concrete pad.

00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:09.540
So let's just call
this liquid stuff--

00:35:09.540 --> 00:35:13.810
the actual word that we use
in parlance is called corium.

00:35:13.810 --> 00:35:16.390
It's our tongue-in-cheek
word for every element

00:35:16.390 --> 00:35:19.600
mixed together in a
hot radioactive soup.

00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:21.640
First of all, it
started to redistribute,

00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:25.040
reacting with any water that was
present, flashing it to steam.

00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:28.340
And the steam caused additional
dispersion of radionuclides.

00:35:28.340 --> 00:35:30.970
And eventually, it
burrowed its way

00:35:30.970 --> 00:35:34.260
through and into the
ground, releasing more.

00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:37.270
It's the worst
nuclear thing that's

00:35:37.270 --> 00:35:40.900
ever happened in the
history of nuclear things.

00:35:40.900 --> 00:35:42.190
Quite a mess.

00:35:42.190 --> 00:35:46.710
And luckily, it did sort
of taper off after this.

00:35:46.710 --> 00:35:50.440
But let's now look
into what happens next.

00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:53.220
And this is the nice intro to
the third part of the course.

00:35:53.220 --> 00:35:57.000
Iodine is preferentially
uptaken by the thyroid gland

00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:59.130
somewhere right about here.

00:35:59.130 --> 00:36:00.630
So has anyone ever
heard of the idea

00:36:00.630 --> 00:36:04.740
of taking iodine tablets in
the case of a nuclear disaster?

00:36:04.740 --> 00:36:05.790
Anyone have any idea why?

00:36:09.660 --> 00:36:11.880
If you saturate your
thyroid with iodine,

00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:14.100
then if you ingest
radioactive iodine,

00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:16.740
it's less likely to
be permanently taken

00:36:16.740 --> 00:36:18.210
by the thyroid.

00:36:18.210 --> 00:36:21.240
So this actually
provided some statistics

00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:24.450
on the probability of
getting thyroid cancer

00:36:24.450 --> 00:36:27.660
from radioactive
iodine ingestion.

00:36:27.660 --> 00:36:29.610
Luckily, the statistics
were quite poor,

00:36:29.610 --> 00:36:31.785
which means that not
many people were exposed.

00:36:31.785 --> 00:36:36.780
It was somewhere around 1,300
or so, not like millions.

00:36:36.780 --> 00:36:39.630
Yeah, 1,300 people total.

00:36:39.630 --> 00:36:44.350
But what I want to jump to is
the dose-versus-risk curve.

00:36:44.350 --> 00:36:46.830
And this is going to belie
all of our discussion

00:36:46.830 --> 00:36:50.940
about the biological long-term
effects of radioactivity.

00:36:50.940 --> 00:36:56.250
What's the most striking thing
you see as part of this curve?

00:36:56.250 --> 00:36:57.550
AUDIENCE: Error bars.

00:36:57.550 --> 00:36:58.717
MICHAEL SHORT: That's right.

00:36:58.717 --> 00:37:00.470
That's the first thing I saw.

00:37:00.470 --> 00:37:04.220
There are six different models
for how dose an increased

00:37:04.220 --> 00:37:05.690
risk of cancer proceeds.

00:37:05.690 --> 00:37:09.050
And they all fall within
almost all the error

00:37:09.050 --> 00:37:11.330
bars of these measurements.

00:37:11.330 --> 00:37:13.280
I say, again, thank
God that the error

00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:16.220
bars are so high because that
means that the sample size was

00:37:16.220 --> 00:37:17.630
so low.

00:37:17.630 --> 00:37:19.220
So when folks say
we don't really

00:37:19.220 --> 00:37:23.180
know how much radioactivity
causes how much cancer, they're

00:37:23.180 --> 00:37:25.820
right because, luckily,
we don't have enough data

00:37:25.820 --> 00:37:30.090
from people being exposed to
know that really, really well.

00:37:30.090 --> 00:37:31.940
So some folks say we
should be cautious.

00:37:31.940 --> 00:37:33.530
I kind of agree with them.

00:37:33.530 --> 00:37:35.030
Some folks say the
jury's still out.

00:37:35.030 --> 00:37:37.710
I also agree with them.

00:37:37.710 --> 00:37:40.200
But you can start to estimate
these sorts of things

00:37:40.200 --> 00:37:43.440
by knowing how much
radiation energy was absorbed

00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:45.600
and to what organ.

00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:49.320
So I think the only technical
thing I want to go over today

00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:50.940
is the different units of dose.

00:37:50.940 --> 00:37:52.505
Because as you
start to read things

00:37:52.505 --> 00:37:53.880
in the reading,
which I recommend

00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:55.770
you do if you haven't
been doing yet,

00:37:55.770 --> 00:37:58.470
you're going to encounter a lot
of different units of radiation

00:37:58.470 --> 00:38:05.390
dose ranging from things like
the roentgen, which responds

00:38:05.390 --> 00:38:07.550
to a number of ionizations.

00:38:10.510 --> 00:38:13.390
You won't usually
see this one given

00:38:13.390 --> 00:38:15.850
in sort of biological parlance.

00:38:15.850 --> 00:38:17.470
Because it's the
number of ionizations

00:38:17.470 --> 00:38:21.220
detected by some sort of
gaseous ionization detector.

00:38:21.220 --> 00:38:23.410
So the dosimeters is
that you all put on--

00:38:23.410 --> 00:38:28.150
did you guys all bring
these brass pen dosimeters

00:38:28.150 --> 00:38:29.170
in through the reactor?

00:38:29.170 --> 00:38:33.077
Did anyone look through them to
see what the unit of dose was?

00:38:33.077 --> 00:38:34.910
It's going to be in
roentgens because that's

00:38:34.910 --> 00:38:38.150
directly corelatable to
the number of ionizations

00:38:38.150 --> 00:38:40.820
that that dosimeter
has experienced.

00:38:40.820 --> 00:38:43.490
You'll also see four
dose units, two of which

00:38:43.490 --> 00:38:46.030
are just factors of 100
away from each other.

00:38:46.030 --> 00:38:49.970
There is what's called
the rad and the gray.

00:38:49.970 --> 00:38:53.510
And there's what's called
the rem and the sievert.

00:38:57.910 --> 00:39:00.580
You'll see these
approximated as gray.

00:39:00.580 --> 00:39:03.370
You'll see these as
R. And these are just

00:39:03.370 --> 00:39:05.760
usually written as rem.

00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:09.070
So a rad is simple.

00:39:09.070 --> 00:39:10.190
Let's see.

00:39:10.190 --> 00:39:15.600
100 rads is the same as 1 gray.

00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:19.590
And 100 rem is the
same as 1 sievert.

00:39:19.590 --> 00:39:23.550
And for the case
of gamma radiation,

00:39:23.550 --> 00:39:26.270
these units are actually equal.

00:39:26.270 --> 00:39:28.760
I particularly like
this set of units

00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:33.290
because this is the kind
of SI of radiation units

00:39:33.290 --> 00:39:35.960
because it comes directly
from measurable calculatable

00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:37.010
quantities.

00:39:37.010 --> 00:39:40.280
Like the gray, for example,
the actual unit of gray

00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:45.290
is joules absorbed per
kilogram of absorber.

00:39:45.290 --> 00:39:47.540
It's a pretty simple
unit to understand.

00:39:47.540 --> 00:39:51.430
If you know how many
radioactive particles or gammas

00:39:51.430 --> 00:39:53.300
or whatever that
you have absorbed,

00:39:53.300 --> 00:39:55.940
you can multiply that
number by their energy,

00:39:55.940 --> 00:39:59.030
divide by the mass of
the organ absorbing them,

00:39:59.030 --> 00:40:01.220
and you get its dose in gray.

00:40:01.220 --> 00:40:07.070
Sievert is gray times
some quality factor

00:40:07.070 --> 00:40:12.470
for the radiation
times some quality

00:40:12.470 --> 00:40:17.880
factor for the specific
type of tissue.

00:40:17.880 --> 00:40:21.360
What this says is that
some types of radiation

00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:24.330
are more effective at
causing damage than others.

00:40:24.330 --> 00:40:27.810
And some organs are more
susceptible to radiation damage

00:40:27.810 --> 00:40:28.740
than others.

00:40:28.740 --> 00:40:31.080
Does anyone happen to know
some of the organs that

00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:35.358
are most susceptible
to radiation damage?

00:40:35.358 --> 00:40:38.107
AUDIENCE: Soft tissues.

00:40:38.107 --> 00:40:39.690
MICHAEL SHORT: Soft
tissues like what?

00:40:39.690 --> 00:40:42.536
Because there's lots of those.

00:40:42.536 --> 00:40:43.930
AUDIENCE: Stomach lining.

00:40:43.930 --> 00:40:44.650
MICHAEL SHORT: Stomach lining.

00:40:44.650 --> 00:40:45.190
Yep.

00:40:45.190 --> 00:40:46.200
Yeah?

00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:47.010
AUDIENCE: Lungs.

00:40:47.010 --> 00:40:47.530
MICHAEL SHORT: Lungs.

00:40:47.530 --> 00:40:48.100
Yep.

00:40:48.100 --> 00:40:50.043
What else?

00:40:50.043 --> 00:40:51.342
AUDIENCE: Thyroid.

00:40:51.342 --> 00:40:52.300
MICHAEL SHORT: Thyroid.

00:40:52.300 --> 00:40:54.430
Yep, there is definitely
one for thyroid.

00:40:54.430 --> 00:40:55.720
AUDIENCE: Bone marrow.

00:40:55.720 --> 00:40:57.690
MICHAEL SHORT: Bone marrow.

00:40:57.690 --> 00:40:58.530
What other ones?

00:41:01.750 --> 00:41:03.700
Brain, actually not so much.

00:41:03.700 --> 00:41:05.650
The eyes.

00:41:05.650 --> 00:41:07.420
And where else do
you find rapidly

00:41:07.420 --> 00:41:09.860
dividing cells in your body?

00:41:09.860 --> 00:41:10.627
AUDIENCE: Skin.

00:41:10.627 --> 00:41:11.460
MICHAEL SHORT: Skin.

00:41:11.460 --> 00:41:12.972
Yep, the dermis.

00:41:12.972 --> 00:41:14.187
AUDIENCE: The liver?

00:41:14.187 --> 00:41:16.020
MICHAEL SHORT: I don't
know about the liver.

00:41:16.020 --> 00:41:16.860
I would assume so.

00:41:16.860 --> 00:41:19.220
Yeah, it's a pretty
active organ.

00:41:19.220 --> 00:41:22.610
But when folks are worried
about birth defects,

00:41:22.610 --> 00:41:24.720
reproductive organs.

00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:26.310
The link here that,
for some reason,

00:41:26.310 --> 00:41:28.560
is not said in the reading,
and I've never figured out

00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:32.310
why, is the more often a cell is
dividing, the more susceptible

00:41:32.310 --> 00:41:35.010
it is to gaining cancer risk.

00:41:35.010 --> 00:41:38.880
Because every cell division
is a copy of its DNA.

00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:42.480
And any time that radiation
goes in and damages or changes

00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:44.760
that DNA by either
causing what's

00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:47.850
called a thiamine bridge where
two thiamine bases get linked

00:41:47.850 --> 00:41:51.060
together or damaging the
structure in some other way,

00:41:51.060 --> 00:41:53.352
that gene is then replicated.

00:41:53.352 --> 00:41:54.810
And the faster
they're replicating,

00:41:54.810 --> 00:41:59.690
the more likely cancer is
going to become apparent.

00:41:59.690 --> 00:42:01.230
I guess this brings
up a question.

00:42:01.230 --> 00:42:04.050
When does a rapidly
dividing cell become cancer?

00:42:04.050 --> 00:42:07.172
Is it division number 1 or
is it when you notice it?

00:42:07.172 --> 00:42:10.260
I guess I'll leave that
question to the biologists.

00:42:10.260 --> 00:42:12.280
But if you notice,
in the reading,

00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:16.060
you'll see a bunch of different
tissue equivalency factors.

00:42:16.060 --> 00:42:17.880
And you'll just see
them tabulated and say,

00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:18.540
there they are.

00:42:18.540 --> 00:42:19.770
Memorize them.

00:42:19.770 --> 00:42:22.590
I want you to try and think
of the pattern between them.

00:42:22.590 --> 00:42:24.600
The tissues that
basically don't matter,

00:42:24.600 --> 00:42:29.880
like the non-marrow part of the
bone, dead skin cells, muscles,

00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:32.070
things that basically
aren't listed that much,

00:42:32.070 --> 00:42:34.050
they're not dividing very fast.

00:42:34.050 --> 00:42:36.750
But anywhere where you
find stem cells, the lining

00:42:36.750 --> 00:42:38.400
of your intestine,
your lungs which

00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:40.430
undergo a lot of
environmental damage

00:42:40.430 --> 00:42:44.070
and need to be replenished,
gonads, dura, skin--

00:42:44.070 --> 00:42:45.570
what was the other
one that we said?

00:42:45.570 --> 00:42:46.950
Eyes.

00:42:46.950 --> 00:42:49.260
These are places that are
either sensitive tissues

00:42:49.260 --> 00:42:52.080
or they're rapidly dividing.

00:42:52.080 --> 00:42:55.790
And so the sievert is kind of in
a unit of increased equivalent

00:42:55.790 --> 00:43:00.650
risk so that, if you were to
absorb one gray of gamma rays

00:43:00.650 --> 00:43:05.420
versus one gray of alphas, you'd
be about 20 times more likely

00:43:05.420 --> 00:43:08.135
to incur cancer from the
alphas than the gammas because

00:43:08.135 --> 00:43:10.700
of the amount of localized
damage that they do to cells.

00:43:10.700 --> 00:43:13.880
And we'll be doing all
this in detail pretty soon.

00:43:13.880 --> 00:43:17.780
And then for tissue equivalency
factor, if you absorb one gray

00:43:17.780 --> 00:43:20.870
and your whole body, which
means one joule per kilogram

00:43:20.870 --> 00:43:24.560
of average body mass,
versus one gray directly

00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:26.090
to the lining of
your intestine by,

00:43:26.090 --> 00:43:29.450
let's say, drinking
polonium-laced tea

00:43:29.450 --> 00:43:32.420
like happened to a
poor-- who was it?

00:43:32.420 --> 00:43:35.680
Current or ex-KGB guy
or the Russian fellas?

00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:38.570
No, it was the KGB guys
that poisoned him, right?

00:43:38.570 --> 00:43:39.070
Yeah.

00:43:39.070 --> 00:43:41.530
Do you guys remember
back in 2010 or so?

00:43:41.530 --> 00:43:43.540
There was a Russian--

00:43:43.540 --> 00:43:45.033
was he a journalist?

00:43:45.033 --> 00:43:46.450
AUDIENCE: Actually,
he was ex-KGB.

00:43:46.450 --> 00:43:47.760
MICHAEL SHORT: Ex-KGB.

00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:50.170
So the current KGB
somehow got into London

00:43:50.170 --> 00:43:53.950
and slipped polonium into his
tea at a Japanese restaurant.

00:43:53.950 --> 00:43:57.353
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:57.353 --> 00:43:58.270
MICHAEL SHORT: Really?

00:43:58.270 --> 00:43:59.437
AUDIENCE: I think so, right?

00:43:59.437 --> 00:44:01.065
[INAUDIBLE] It was unsuccessful.

00:44:01.065 --> 00:44:02.440
MICHAEL SHORT:
What was his name?

00:44:05.090 --> 00:44:05.705
Let's see.

00:44:09.380 --> 00:44:12.850
The polonium poisoning.

00:44:12.850 --> 00:44:15.070
Did he actually die?

00:44:15.070 --> 00:44:17.050
Poisoning of
Alexander Litvinenko.

00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:23.135
AUDIENCE: That's
pretty close to dead.

00:44:23.135 --> 00:44:24.760
MICHAEL SHORT: He's
not doing too well.

00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:32.850
Illness and poisoning,
death, and last statement

00:44:32.850 --> 00:44:34.110
at the hospital in London.

00:44:34.110 --> 00:44:34.763
So yeah.

00:44:34.763 --> 00:44:36.638
AUDIENCE: He probably
said something awesome.

00:44:36.638 --> 00:44:38.010
AUDIENCE: What did he say?

00:44:38.010 --> 00:44:40.790
MICHAEL SHORT:
Well, interesting.

00:44:40.790 --> 00:44:42.540
That probably has
something to do with it.

00:44:42.540 --> 00:44:45.037
AUDIENCE: That's a lot
of-- a really long last--

00:44:45.037 --> 00:44:45.870
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah?

00:44:45.870 --> 00:44:48.810
Well, we're not going to
comment on the politics.

00:44:48.810 --> 00:44:53.280
But the radiation effect
worked, clearly, unfortunately.

00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:55.470
So polonium is an alpha emitter.

00:44:55.470 --> 00:44:57.990
And that caused a
massive dose of alphas

00:44:57.990 --> 00:45:00.460
to his entire
gastrointestinal tract.

00:45:00.460 --> 00:45:03.060
And that caused a whole lot
of damage to those cells.

00:45:03.060 --> 00:45:04.410
No time for cancer.

00:45:04.410 --> 00:45:06.900
It actually killed off a
lot of those stem cells.

00:45:06.900 --> 00:45:09.420
And the way that radiation
poisoning would work

00:45:09.420 --> 00:45:11.190
is that, if you kill
off the stem cells,

00:45:11.190 --> 00:45:12.660
the villi in your
intestines die,

00:45:12.660 --> 00:45:15.390
which are responsible
for absorbing nutrition.

00:45:15.390 --> 00:45:17.610
You can't uptake nutrition.

00:45:17.610 --> 00:45:18.690
You basically starve.

00:45:18.690 --> 00:45:20.310
It doesn't matter what you eat.

00:45:20.310 --> 00:45:22.290
It's messed up.

00:45:22.290 --> 00:45:24.450
Yeah.

00:45:24.450 --> 00:45:26.017
That's a really bad way to go.

00:45:26.017 --> 00:45:27.600
It's called
gastrointestinal syndrome.

00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:31.170
And we'll be talking about
the progressive effects

00:45:31.170 --> 00:45:33.480
of acute radiation
exposure where

00:45:33.480 --> 00:45:36.270
you have immediate
effects mostly relating

00:45:36.270 --> 00:45:40.200
to the death of some organ that
is responsible for either cell

00:45:40.200 --> 00:45:43.230
division to keep you alive
or, in extreme cases,

00:45:43.230 --> 00:45:44.730
your neurological system.

00:45:44.730 --> 00:45:47.850
And nerve function just stops
at the highest levels of dose.

00:45:47.850 --> 00:45:52.530
And that corresponds to
doses of around 4 to 6 gray.

00:45:52.530 --> 00:45:57.220
4 to 6 joules per kilogram
of villi, or body mass,

00:45:57.220 --> 00:45:59.880
will kill you pretty quickly
with very little chance

00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:02.250
of survival as
what happened here.

00:46:02.250 --> 00:46:03.450
And so this was the problem.

00:46:03.450 --> 00:46:08.010
With all the folks living around
and near Chernobyl and Ukraine

00:46:08.010 --> 00:46:11.040
and Belarus and everywhere
was the contamination

00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:13.290
was pretty extensive.

00:46:13.290 --> 00:46:15.990
About 4,000 people are
estimated to have died

00:46:15.990 --> 00:46:17.550
or contracted cancer from this.

00:46:17.550 --> 00:46:19.680
I can't believe how
low that number is.

00:46:19.680 --> 00:46:22.480
But it's still 4,000 people that
should've never happened to.

00:46:22.480 --> 00:46:25.905
And effects were felt far
away in towns like Gomel

00:46:25.905 --> 00:46:27.780
and-- can't read that
one because there's not

00:46:27.780 --> 00:46:29.430
enough pixels.

00:46:29.430 --> 00:46:32.520
Because of the way that,
let's say, rainwater--

00:46:32.520 --> 00:46:35.780
or let's say the vapor
cloud from the reactor was--

00:46:35.780 --> 00:46:37.440
the way rainwater
caused it to fall

00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:40.050
on certain places, which
still, to this day,

00:46:40.050 --> 00:46:43.080
can have a really large
contamination area.

00:46:43.080 --> 00:46:45.330
And this brings me a little
bit into what should we be

00:46:45.330 --> 00:46:47.400
worried about from Fukushima--

00:46:47.400 --> 00:46:49.740
a whole lot less than Chernobyl.

00:46:49.740 --> 00:46:52.140
And the reason why
is Fukushima did

00:46:52.140 --> 00:46:54.900
undergo a hydrogen
explosion and did

00:46:54.900 --> 00:46:59.400
and still continues to release
cesium-137 into the ocean.

00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:02.170
Luckily, for us,
the ocean is big.

00:47:02.170 --> 00:47:05.500
And except for fish caught
right near around Fukushima,

00:47:05.500 --> 00:47:08.680
even though concentrations
can be measured at hundreds

00:47:08.680 --> 00:47:11.500
to thousands of times
normal concentrations,

00:47:11.500 --> 00:47:13.510
they can still be hundreds
to thousands of times

00:47:13.510 --> 00:47:16.360
lower than the safe consumption.

00:47:16.360 --> 00:47:20.007
So a lot of the problems
you see in the news today,

00:47:20.007 --> 00:47:21.340
I'm not going to call them lies.

00:47:21.340 --> 00:47:23.320
But I'm going to call
them half truths.

00:47:23.320 --> 00:47:27.670
Folks will show the radiation
plume of cesium-137 escaping

00:47:27.670 --> 00:47:28.800
from Fukushima.

00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:29.800
And that's true.

00:47:29.800 --> 00:47:31.690
There is radiation escaping.

00:47:31.690 --> 00:47:33.610
The question is,
is it high enough

00:47:33.610 --> 00:47:38.623
to cause a noticeable
increased risk of cancer?

00:47:38.623 --> 00:47:40.040
That's the question
that reporters

00:47:40.040 --> 00:47:41.543
shouldn't be asking themselves.

00:47:41.543 --> 00:47:43.460
When they only tell the
half of the story that

00:47:43.460 --> 00:47:45.950
gets them viewers and they
don't tell the half of the story

00:47:45.950 --> 00:47:48.440
to complete the
story and tell you,

00:47:48.440 --> 00:47:49.910
should you be afraid or not?

00:47:49.910 --> 00:47:52.850
Because unfortunately,
fear brings viewers.

00:47:52.850 --> 00:47:53.930
This is the problem--

00:47:53.930 --> 00:47:56.300
and I'm happy to go
on camera saying this.

00:47:56.300 --> 00:47:59.523
This is the problem
with the media today is,

00:47:59.523 --> 00:48:01.190
with a half truth and
with a half story,

00:48:01.190 --> 00:48:04.820
you can incite real panic
over non-physical issues

00:48:04.820 --> 00:48:07.340
that may not actually exist.

00:48:07.340 --> 00:48:10.580
And so it's important that the
media tell the whole story.

00:48:10.580 --> 00:48:15.790
Yes, it's true that Fukushima's
releasing cesium-137.

00:48:15.790 --> 00:48:18.190
How much though is the question
that people and the media

00:48:18.190 --> 00:48:19.978
should be asking themselves.

00:48:19.978 --> 00:48:21.520
And in the rest of
this course, we're

00:48:21.520 --> 00:48:25.280
going to answer the question,
how much is too much?

00:48:25.280 --> 00:48:28.050
So I'm going to stop
here since it's 2 of 5 of

00:48:28.050 --> 00:48:29.800
and ask you guys if
you have any questions

00:48:29.800 --> 00:48:31.990
on the whole second
part of the course

00:48:31.990 --> 00:48:33.571
or what happened in Chernobyl.

00:48:37.340 --> 00:48:37.950
Yeah.

00:48:37.950 --> 00:48:38.575
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:48:38.575 --> 00:48:40.370
Could you explain the
quality factor term

00:48:40.370 --> 00:48:42.610
and how you find that?

00:48:42.610 --> 00:48:43.743
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah.

00:48:43.743 --> 00:48:45.160
Well, there's two
quality factors.

00:48:45.160 --> 00:48:49.300
There is the quality factor for
radiation, which will tell you,

00:48:49.300 --> 00:48:51.370
let's say, how much
more cell damage

00:48:51.370 --> 00:48:55.120
a given amount of a given type
of radiation of the same energy

00:48:55.120 --> 00:48:57.670
will deposit into a cell.

00:48:57.670 --> 00:48:59.740
And the tissue
equivalency factor

00:48:59.740 --> 00:49:01.840
tells you, well,
what's the added

00:49:01.840 --> 00:49:06.010
risk of some sort of defect
leading to cell death or cancer

00:49:06.010 --> 00:49:10.360
or some other defect from
that radiation absorption.

00:49:10.360 --> 00:49:12.670
So to me, the tissue
equivalency factor

00:49:12.670 --> 00:49:15.460
is roughly, but not
completely, approximated

00:49:15.460 --> 00:49:17.260
by the cell division rate.

00:49:17.260 --> 00:49:20.200
And the radiation
quality factor is

00:49:20.200 --> 00:49:24.190
going to be quite proportional
to the stopping power.

00:49:24.190 --> 00:49:29.790
You'll see a term called the
Linear Energy Transfer, or LET.

00:49:29.790 --> 00:49:33.870
This is the stopping power unit
used in the biology community.

00:49:33.870 --> 00:49:35.263
It's stopping power.

00:49:35.263 --> 00:49:36.930
And luckily, the
Turner reading actually

00:49:36.930 --> 00:49:39.360
says it's somewhere
buried in a paragraph.

00:49:39.360 --> 00:49:41.400
LET is stopping power.

00:49:41.400 --> 00:49:43.350
So if you start plotting
these two together,

00:49:43.350 --> 00:49:45.720
you might find some
striking similarities.

00:49:45.720 --> 00:49:47.840
I saw two other
questions up here.

00:49:47.840 --> 00:49:50.000
Yeah?

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:52.335
AUDIENCE: Why is Chernobyl
still considered off limits

00:49:52.335 --> 00:49:54.290
if most the half-lives
of these things

00:49:54.290 --> 00:49:58.110
are on the range of
days to two years?

00:49:58.110 --> 00:49:59.293
I mean, it happened--

00:49:59.293 --> 00:50:01.210
MICHAEL SHORT: Let's
answer that with numbers.

00:50:01.210 --> 00:50:05.520
So most of the half-lives were
on the range of days to hours.

00:50:05.520 --> 00:50:09.090
But still, cesium-137, with
a half-life of 30 years,

00:50:09.090 --> 00:50:11.940
released a third
of an exabecquerel.

00:50:11.940 --> 00:50:14.100
That's one of the major
sources of contamination

00:50:14.100 --> 00:50:15.210
still out there.

00:50:15.210 --> 00:50:19.250
In addition, if we scroll
down a little more,

00:50:19.250 --> 00:50:21.620
there was quite a bit
of plutonium inventory

00:50:21.620 --> 00:50:24.620
with a half-life
of 24,000 years.

00:50:24.620 --> 00:50:27.260
So on Friday, we're going
to have Jake Hecla come in

00:50:27.260 --> 00:50:29.510
and give his
Chernobyl travelogue

00:50:29.510 --> 00:50:32.570
because one of our seniors has
actually been to Chernobyl.

00:50:32.570 --> 00:50:35.330
And his boots were so
contaminated with plutonium

00:50:35.330 --> 00:50:37.010
that he could never
use them again.

00:50:37.010 --> 00:50:39.030
They've got to stay
wrapped up in plastic.

00:50:39.030 --> 00:50:42.570
So some of these things last
tens of thousands of years.

00:50:42.570 --> 00:50:44.150
And even though
there weren't a lot

00:50:44.150 --> 00:50:47.180
of petabecquerels of
plutonium released,

00:50:47.180 --> 00:50:48.650
they're alpha emitters.

00:50:48.650 --> 00:50:51.380
And they're extremely
dangerous when ingested.

00:50:51.380 --> 00:50:55.790
So greens and things
that uptake radionuclides

00:50:55.790 --> 00:50:58.940
from the soil like moss and
mushrooms are totally off

00:50:58.940 --> 00:51:02.440
limits in a large
range of this area.

00:51:02.440 --> 00:51:04.230
You will find the
video online, if you

00:51:04.230 --> 00:51:06.263
look, of a mayor from
a nearby town saying,

00:51:06.263 --> 00:51:07.680
oh, they're perfectly
safe to eat.

00:51:07.680 --> 00:51:09.030
Look, I eat them right here.

00:51:09.030 --> 00:51:11.070
And I just say read
the comments for what

00:51:11.070 --> 00:51:13.140
people have to say about that.

00:51:13.140 --> 00:51:14.580
Not too smart.

00:51:14.580 --> 00:51:15.290
Yeah.

00:51:15.290 --> 00:51:17.076
AUDIENCE: So what's
the process now

00:51:17.076 --> 00:51:20.953
for taking care of [INAUDIBLE]?

00:51:20.953 --> 00:51:23.120
MICHAEL SHORT: So the
sarcophagus around the reactor

00:51:23.120 --> 00:51:24.620
has got to be shored
up to make sure

00:51:24.620 --> 00:51:26.010
that nothing else gets out.

00:51:26.010 --> 00:51:28.500
Because most of the
reactor is still there.

00:51:28.500 --> 00:51:30.390
And let's say rainwater
comes in and starts

00:51:30.390 --> 00:51:32.670
washing away more stuff
into the ground or whatever.

00:51:32.670 --> 00:51:34.230
We don't want that to happen.

00:51:34.230 --> 00:51:37.560
Soil replacement and
disposal as nuclear waste

00:51:37.560 --> 00:51:39.540
is still going on.

00:51:39.540 --> 00:51:41.520
Removal of any moss,
lichen, mushrooms,

00:51:41.520 --> 00:51:43.980
or anything with a sort
of radiation exposure

00:51:43.980 --> 00:51:44.980
has got to keep going.

00:51:44.980 --> 00:51:48.840
But the area that it
covers is enormous.

00:51:48.840 --> 00:51:51.437
I don't know if we're ever
going to get rid of all of it.

00:51:51.437 --> 00:51:53.520
The question is, how much
do we have to get rid of

00:51:53.520 --> 00:51:57.510
to lower our risk of cancer in
the area to an acceptable rate?

00:51:57.510 --> 00:51:59.430
There will likely
be parts of this

00:51:59.430 --> 00:52:01.860
that are inaccessible for
thousands to tens of thousands

00:52:01.860 --> 00:52:04.080
of years unless we
hopefully get smarter

00:52:04.080 --> 00:52:06.990
about how to contain and
dispose of this kind of stuff.

00:52:06.990 --> 00:52:08.350
We're not there yet.

00:52:08.350 --> 00:52:11.220
So right now, the methods
are kind of simple.

00:52:11.220 --> 00:52:12.630
Get rid of the soil.

00:52:12.630 --> 00:52:14.070
Fence off the area.

00:52:14.070 --> 00:52:16.560
Some folks have been returning.

00:52:16.560 --> 00:52:18.852
And they do get compensation
and free medical visits

00:52:18.852 --> 00:52:20.310
because the background
levels there

00:52:20.310 --> 00:52:23.530
are elevated but not that high.

00:52:23.530 --> 00:52:27.640
So folks have started to move
back to some of these areas.

00:52:27.640 --> 00:52:31.010
But there's a lot that
are still off limits.

00:52:31.010 --> 00:52:33.720
Any other questions?

00:52:33.720 --> 00:52:34.255
Yeah.

00:52:34.255 --> 00:52:37.437
AUDIENCE: It's way worse
than the atomic bombs dropped

00:52:37.437 --> 00:52:39.810
on Hiroshima and
Nagasaki because those

00:52:39.810 --> 00:52:42.617
are full-functioning
cities at this point.

00:52:42.617 --> 00:52:43.450
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah.

00:52:43.450 --> 00:52:46.720
The number of deaths
from the atomic bombs way

00:52:46.720 --> 00:52:48.880
outweighed the number
of deaths that will ever

00:52:48.880 --> 00:52:49.820
happen from Chernobyl.

00:52:49.820 --> 00:52:51.430
AUDIENCE: But why
is the radiation

00:52:51.430 --> 00:52:53.755
from those bombs not--

00:52:53.755 --> 00:52:55.630
MICHAEL SHORT: Oh, not
that much of an issue?

00:52:55.630 --> 00:52:57.940
There wasn't that much material.

00:52:57.940 --> 00:53:00.702
There wasn't that much nuclear
material in an atomic bomb.

00:53:00.702 --> 00:53:03.160
What did you guys get for the
radius of the critical sphere

00:53:03.160 --> 00:53:05.070
of plutonium?

00:53:05.070 --> 00:53:06.765
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
centimeters.

00:53:06.765 --> 00:53:07.890
MICHAEL SHORT: Centimeters?

00:53:07.890 --> 00:53:08.390
Yeah.

00:53:08.390 --> 00:53:09.820
It doesn't take a lot.

00:53:09.820 --> 00:53:14.360
It takes 10, 20 kilos
to make a weapon.

00:53:14.360 --> 00:53:16.690
Now, we're talking
about tons or thousands

00:53:16.690 --> 00:53:18.050
of tons of material released.

00:53:18.050 --> 00:53:21.640
So an atomic weapon
doesn't kill by radiation.

00:53:21.640 --> 00:53:25.330
It kills by pressure
wave, the heat wave.

00:53:25.330 --> 00:53:27.850
The fallout is not
as much of a concern.

00:53:27.850 --> 00:53:30.700
And we'll actually be looking
at the data from Hiroshima

00:53:30.700 --> 00:53:32.380
and Nagasaki
survivors to see who

00:53:32.380 --> 00:53:36.100
got what dose, what increased
cancer risk did they get,

00:53:36.100 --> 00:53:40.300
and is the idea that every
little bit of radiation

00:53:40.300 --> 00:53:42.040
is a bad thing actually true.

00:53:42.040 --> 00:53:44.930
The answer is you
can't say yes or no.

00:53:44.930 --> 00:53:48.660
No one can say yes or no because
we don't have good enough data.

00:53:48.660 --> 00:53:51.513
The error bars support
either conclusion.

00:53:51.513 --> 00:53:53.180
So I'm not going to
go on record and say

00:53:53.180 --> 00:53:54.730
a little bit of radiation is OK.

00:53:54.730 --> 00:53:55.943
They data is not out yet.

00:53:55.943 --> 00:53:57.110
Hopefully, it never will be.

00:54:00.850 --> 00:54:03.940
Any other questions?

00:54:03.940 --> 00:54:04.850
All right.

00:54:04.850 --> 00:54:06.960
I'll see you guys on Thursday.

WEBVTT

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:19.170
PROFESSOR: All right,
so fluorescence.

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.270
You know, I know you
hear this from me a lot.

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.570
But this really is
my favorite topic.

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.990
The applications of
luminescence and fluorescence

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.650
in service to biology
are incredibly important.

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:35.820
So what I'm going to try
to do in these two lectures

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.570
is explain to you the
difference between fluorophores

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.220
that we can encode into proteins
through genetic engineering

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:46.440
and fluorophores
that we use that are

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.340
made by chemists in the lab
but then appended to molecules.

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.480
So today we'll talk about the
nuts and bolts of fluorescence.

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.100
And then on
Wednesday, we'll start

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.740
to see some of these tools
that you've seen images of.

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:05.640
We love to wow you with images
of fluorescent cells and cells

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:06.480
in action.

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.510
But I want to step back
and actually show you how

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.280
that all came about.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.900
Where do these fluorescent
proteins come from?

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.300
What are we looking for?

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.090
How much protein
engineering was done

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.470
to make these such an amazingly
useful set of molecules,

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.280
macromolecules to really
allow us in real time

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.180
to study biology?

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.630
And there are many, many
other applications as well.

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.130
So we're going to talk about
luminescence and fluorescence

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.450
in general.

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.415
Luminescence is
the general term.

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.350
And fluorescence is a
little bit more specific.

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.660
There are different
types of luminescence.

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:51.910
And you'll get to see
some of those varieties

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:53.080
of luminescence.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.660
I've put a decent amount of our
content today on the screen.

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:58.580
So we'll go up here
and take a look.

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:02.020
So luminescence in
general is the emission

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.290
of light not associated
with heat, not

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:09.190
like a burning flame which has
a lot of light accompanying it.

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.500
But rather the emission of
light in the absence of heat.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.580
And there are different types of
luminescence the biologists use

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.850
intertwined into
biological experiments

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.100
to illuminate
life, to understand

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.710
details of cellular activity.

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:30.040
But also as reagents
in diagnostics

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.340
in all kinds of
imaging modalities.

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:34.600
And through these two--

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.270
three lectures, actually,
because Professor Martin

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:39.970
will give you one that has
even more imaging in it--

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.630
you'll sort of really get to
understand where these pretty

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:45.950
magical reagents come from.

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.100
So the two types of
luminescence that we

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:53.200
won't discuss in detail today,
first of all chemiluminescence.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.140
This is a molecule
known as luminol

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:57.610
sitting in a little bile.

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.210
I think I like fluorescence so
much because the images are so

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:02.650
captivating.

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.890
Now, things like luminol, has
anyone heard of luminol before?

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.430
Does anyone-- yeah, do you
watch a lot of CSI or--

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:10.090
yeah.

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.935
So tell everybody what
people use luminol for.

00:03:13.935 --> 00:03:16.590
AUDIENCE: To pick up on a blood
spatter or remnants of blood.

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.170
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so
when you see these TV

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:24.580
shows and there's this
beautifully clean motel room

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:27.880
and nothing looks like
it ever happened there.

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.880
But people thought there was
a murder took place there,

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.790
you'll notice they come in
with these spray bottles.

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.623
And spray all over the carpets,
and the drapes, and the chairs.

00:03:37.623 --> 00:03:39.040
And then there's
this great moment

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.420
where they turn off the
light and luminol interacts

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:48.280
with the heme of blood at an
amazingly sensitive level,

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.650
such that when the
lights are turned out,

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.950
the room's just sort
of this battlefield

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:56.560
of bright luminescence
that indicates

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.130
that this was a crime scene.

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:03.180
So that's the most famous
luminol sort of example.

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.690
So that is what would be
called chemiluminescence,

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:08.650
the interaction of a chemical
with another chemical

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:10.420
to give luminescence.

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:12.900
Another pretty useful
type of luminescence

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.890
is bioluminescence.

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:16.959
I've done a lot of
scuba diving in my life.

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:20.290
And there's nothing more
exciting than a dive at night

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:24.220
where the whole ocean is
this sort of inky black.

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:26.080
And sometimes you'll
move your arms

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.450
through the black
water at night.

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:31.470
And you'll see all these,
like, little fireworks.

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:35.530
And many, many marine
organisms actually

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:37.600
undergo bioluminescence.

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.170
It's a biological reaction
that causes luminescence.

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:44.110
And this is a
cuttlefish shown here

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:47.560
in this image in
the corner where

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.550
they are brightly lit at night.

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:51.340
And actually, it's
just a whole party

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:54.820
there at night in the ocean
where all sorts of organisms

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:58.870
are signaling to other organisms
through bioluminescence

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:01.850
and reactions such as
luciferase reactions.

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:04.870
So in bioluminescence,
a molecule of ATP

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:09.130
is generally used and
combined with another molecule

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:11.680
through the action of
an enzyme that ends up

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.700
kicking out light energy.

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:14.960
So those are both important.

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.740
But what we're going to
talk about principally

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:19.690
is fluorescence.

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:21.455
This is a more specific term.

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:28.180
And you may wonder
why I'm putting

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:31.158
this in capital letters.

00:05:31.158 --> 00:05:32.950
The first thing to
learn about fluorescence

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:35.560
is how to spell fluorescence.

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:37.480
So if you look at
the word fluorescence

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:41.950
and the first word first part
of the word looks like flower,

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:44.620
you know the stuff you
bake your pumpkin pie with,

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:46.270
you spelled it wrong.

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:50.722
It actually is
fluor, F-L-U-O-R-E-S.

00:05:50.722 --> 00:05:52.180
What are you guys
whispering about?

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:53.530
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:55.280
PROFESSOR: Did I get
something else wrong?

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:56.471
AUDIENCE: The E-S.

00:05:56.471 --> 00:05:59.420
PROFESSOR: E-S, yeah, well,
forget about that part.

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:02.550
E-S. There's another C in there.

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:04.520
There we go, we
snuggled that in.

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:07.140
So the important part
is the first part.

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:09.770
So make it look like you know
what you're talking about

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:11.390
and spell fluorescence
correctly.

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:14.810
I cannot tell you
how many papers,

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:17.340
scientific papers I read where
they spelled fluorescence

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:17.840
wrong.

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:19.340
It's really hysterical.

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:20.240
It's one of those--

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:23.300
there's two or three
amazingly common typos

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:24.440
in people's slides.

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:26.750
One of them is spelling
fluorescence wrong

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:29.870
and the other one is
spelling complement wrong.

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:31.610
Complement as
opposed to compliment

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:33.530
where you're telling
someone they look good.

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:34.970
And complement
where you're trying

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:37.710
to sort of match up things.

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:40.250
Anyway, but fluorescence
is a key point.

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:41.870
So what is fluorescence?

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:58.030
It's the absorption of
light energy by a molecule.

00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:01.330
Now it could be a
small, organic molecule.

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:05.020
It could be a small part
of a fluorescent protein

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:07.450
molecule that has a
particular structure.

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:11.350
But it will absorb light
energy at a certain wavelength.

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:15.070
So let's put this into
just a cuvette experiment.

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:19.090
These are the kinds
of little containers

00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:21.470
that we use for certain
types of fluorescence.

00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:24.220
We could use a plate
and a plate reader.

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:25.840
But this is quite common.

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:28.170
So you shine light
on this molecule.

00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:35.540
Do you want to nab the doors,
the outer doors on both sides?

00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:36.150
I don't know.

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:38.080
Everybody's pretty happy today.

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:40.590
Anyway, and the molecule goes.

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:45.430
And I'm going to
just draw something,

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:49.620
you know, with a bunch of
double bonds and things.

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:54.700
And the molecule absorbs light
and goes to an excited state.

00:07:54.700 --> 00:08:00.300
So this is the ground
state before light.

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:09.070
After light you get the
molecule in an excited state.

00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:13.540
So it has absorbed
that light energy.

00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:16.980
So you've hit it with
a wavelength of light.

00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:19.590
And I'm going to redefine
all these terms properly

00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:20.700
in a moment.

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:26.250
Lambda excitation of a
particular wavelength.

00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:29.010
Once that molecule
has absorbed light,

00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:33.750
there's a very transient period
until the molecule lets out

00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:35.205
energy in the form of light.

00:08:42.669 --> 00:08:46.090
And returns back to
its ground state now.

00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:52.510
So that the photo
physics of fluorescence

00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:55.510
involves the excitation
of a molecule with light

00:08:55.510 --> 00:08:56.980
of one energy.

00:08:56.980 --> 00:08:59.670
That light energy is at
a particular wavelength

00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:03.910
so it's called its
lambda of excitation.

00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:06.130
That molecule very,
very transiently,

00:09:06.130 --> 00:09:08.620
it's usually picoseconds
or nanoseconds

00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:10.240
for organic molecules.

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:13.870
It may be a little bit longer
for other types of complexes

00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:17.050
and may stretch to the
microsecond or millisecond.

00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:19.750
But most of what we talk
about will be picosecond

00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:21.730
to nanosecond lifetime.

00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:25.810
And once it's excited, it
just drops its energy back out

00:09:25.810 --> 00:09:27.670
and goes back to
the ground state.

00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:31.030
And the most important thing
that you want to remember

00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:41.510
is the wavelength, which
is given in nanometers.

00:09:41.510 --> 00:09:49.000
And the wavelength for emission,
which is also in nanometers.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.200
This wavelength
is higher energy.

00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:57.520
Obviously you
don't create energy

00:09:57.520 --> 00:09:59.560
when you shine
light on something.

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:02.650
You'd be breaking a few
fundamental rules if you did.

00:10:02.650 --> 00:10:07.870
So the light that comes
back out is lower energy

00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:10.570
because there's been
rearrangements in the excited

00:10:10.570 --> 00:10:11.750
state of the molecule.

00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:16.420
So you can't possibly kick
energy out at a higher energy.

00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:24.700
And so this is a shorter
wavelength in nanometers.

00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:26.926
And this is at a
longer wavelength.

00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:34.640
So remember, higher energy
are shorter wavelength.

00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:37.340
Lower energy are
longer wavelengths.

00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:39.650
And that is a rule
for fluorescence.

00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:41.510
When you excite a
molecule, you'll

00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:43.430
take it to the excited state.

00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:45.680
It'll sit and vibrate
there a little bit.

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:48.590
Then it will kick back energy
out at a longer wavelength.

00:10:48.590 --> 00:10:52.220
And for the majority of the
fluorescence experiments

00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:55.070
that we do in biology,
the wavelengths

00:10:55.070 --> 00:11:03.020
that you see emission at
are in the visible range.

00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:07.280
Whereas the wavelengths that you
might excite your molecule at

00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:16.740
are often in the UV or a
bit longer, ideally, longer.

00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:18.597
And these things are
going to come up.

00:11:18.597 --> 00:11:20.930
This isn't the first time
that you're going to see them.

00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:23.710
And it's not the last time
you're going to see them.

00:11:23.710 --> 00:11:26.270
So let's take a look
at fluorescent dyes

00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:29.940
in the electromagnetic spectrum
in the next couple of slides.

00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:39.580
So what you see here, you see a
bunch of little eppendorf vials

00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:42.700
with fluorescent
molecules that emit light

00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:44.680
at all different wavelengths.

00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:47.110
These would be down
at the ultraviolet end

00:11:47.110 --> 00:11:49.480
of the electromagnetic spectrum.

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:53.920
These would be up in the very
red end, the lowest energy.

00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:56.560
So these emission
wavelengths, these

00:11:56.560 --> 00:12:00.880
would be emitting at the lowest
energy, longest wavelength.

00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:04.780
These would be emitting at the
shortest wavelength, lowest

00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:06.268
to highest energy.

00:12:06.268 --> 00:12:07.310
Is everyone following me?

00:12:07.310 --> 00:12:09.180
So just make sure
you remember that.

00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:12.490
And just this principle
rule that you can't possibly

00:12:12.490 --> 00:12:15.160
break with respect to
the wavelengths of light

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:17.290
for fluorescence experiments.

00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:20.710
So what we're going to
see is the relationship

00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:22.140
for the electromagnetic
spectrum.

00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:24.130
There's a little bit
more detail in a minute.

00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:26.110
And then look at
some fluorescent dyes

00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:29.240
that are very, very
commonly used in biology.

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:31.690
And in fact, you
will have seen a lot

00:12:31.690 --> 00:12:35.500
of cells stained with these
dyes even so far in pictures

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:37.300
that you've seen on the screen.

00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:41.020
And then we'll talk about
the application of antibody

00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:43.300
reagents and where does
that come in with respect

00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:44.590
to fluorescences.

00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:46.570
So let's take a
look at fluorescence

00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:48.520
and the electromagnetic
spectrum.

00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:52.720
So here it is, going
from wavelengths.

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:55.870
The ultraviolet wavelengths
would be shorter

00:12:55.870 --> 00:12:58.420
than 400 nanometers.

00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:01.300
So ultraviolet,
so beyond violet.

00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:05.230
And the very red wavelengths
would be in the range

00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:07.330
from 600 to 700.

00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:09.580
And here you see
the relationship

00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:15.640
between wavelength, and
then what the light emitted

00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:16.610
would look like.

00:13:16.610 --> 00:13:20.230
So if we're looking at here,
what we would expect to see

00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:23.930
is if we've got a fluorophore
and it shows fluorescence,

00:13:23.930 --> 00:13:26.530
we would be exciting
the fluorophore

00:13:26.530 --> 00:13:28.530
in wavelengths in this region.

00:13:28.530 --> 00:13:31.510
And we would see emission in
wavelengths in this region.

00:13:31.510 --> 00:13:36.040
But a cardinal rule is that we
excite with a shorter, higher

00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:38.950
energy wavelength
and observe emission

00:13:38.950 --> 00:13:42.020
at a longer, lower
energy wavelength.

00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:45.220
Now, there's very
important dyes.

00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:47.500
Straight away the
most common dye

00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:50.800
that you will see
immediately in biology

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:52.900
is a dye known as
ethidium bromide.

00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:54.640
And here's its structure.

00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:57.190
You can often
recognize fluorophores.

00:13:57.190 --> 00:14:00.640
They have lots of rings
fused together with lots

00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:02.450
of double bonds in them.

00:14:02.450 --> 00:14:04.240
This is the structure
of a compound

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:06.610
known as ethidium bromide.

00:14:06.610 --> 00:14:11.480
It's a dye that
intercalates into DNA.

00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:13.900
And when the dye
changes its environment

00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:19.390
from being in water to being
snuggled in between stacks

00:14:19.390 --> 00:14:23.920
of base pairs in DNA, it changes
its fluorescent properties

00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:26.020
and it becomes fluorescence.

00:14:26.020 --> 00:14:30.290
So fluorescence isn't just the
intrinsic shape of the molecule

00:14:30.290 --> 00:14:31.630
and what it looks like.

00:14:31.630 --> 00:14:35.980
It's very, very often
related to what's around it.

00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:37.520
Why is that the case?

00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:41.680
It's because the excited
state may behave differently

00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:43.420
in different environments.

00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:45.940
Maybe stabilize for
a while, and that's

00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:49.330
why you might see
fluorophores experience

00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:51.910
a change in their
fluorescence as a function

00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:53.100
of their environment.

00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:54.580
Is that clear to everyone?

00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:57.550
So the molecular environments,
if I'm a fluorophore

00:14:57.550 --> 00:15:00.220
and I'm in water, I'm going
to feel pretty differently

00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:02.620
in my excited state
if I'm a fluorophore

00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:06.100
and I'm sitting packed
between DNA bases.

00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:08.230
It's pretty dramatic
when you see it.

00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:11.590
So when you mix ethidium
bromide with DNA,

00:15:11.590 --> 00:15:15.550
and it could be in a cell or it
could be a lysate from a cell

00:15:15.550 --> 00:15:19.120
where you're capturing the DNA
and trying to manipulate it

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:21.130
in recombinant biology.

00:15:21.130 --> 00:15:25.180
That ethidium bromide will
intercalate into the DNA.

00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:28.840
And it will light up
as a bright orange dye.

00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:34.330
So here, say we've got a
gel that we've run DNA on.

00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:36.850
We might have a
set of standards.

00:15:36.850 --> 00:15:40.690
And in other places, we're
looking for the size of DNA.

00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:42.430
Remember that
great experiment we

00:15:42.430 --> 00:15:46.720
saw where we saw how quickly
small and large pieces of DNA

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:48.910
ran through an agarose gel?

00:15:48.910 --> 00:15:52.030
So here is what
the DNA gel would

00:15:52.030 --> 00:15:56.110
look like if you soaked
it ethidium bromide.

00:15:56.110 --> 00:15:58.600
So here's the gel as
a ladder of bands.

00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:02.950
But then let's say you wanted to
do some work on a piece of DNA

00:16:02.950 --> 00:16:07.960
and maybe ligated you see DNA
pieces at different wavelengths

00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:11.080
that have different
mobilities based on size.

00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:14.202
We couldn't see
the DNA directly.

00:16:14.202 --> 00:16:15.160
We couldn't pick it up.

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:16.600
We couldn't visualize it.

00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:19.190
So we have to use
ways to visualize it.

00:16:19.190 --> 00:16:21.630
One way is to radio label it.

00:16:21.630 --> 00:16:23.830
Messy, we don't really
want to do a lot of that

00:16:23.830 --> 00:16:25.060
if we can avoid it.

00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:28.450
The other way is simply to
soak a dye into the gel.

00:16:28.450 --> 00:16:31.780
And the dye, because of
the positive charge here,

00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:33.790
the counter ion gets displaced.

00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:36.130
And the positive
charge gets attracted

00:16:36.130 --> 00:16:39.970
to the DNA and associates
with it quite tightly.

00:16:39.970 --> 00:16:43.810
So that would be a way
that you would observe

00:16:43.810 --> 00:16:47.200
DNA bound to dye in a gel.

00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:50.270
And this fluoresces a
pretty long wavelength.

00:16:50.270 --> 00:16:52.690
So this fluoresces
this bright orange

00:16:52.690 --> 00:16:54.970
that's actually at about 605.

00:16:54.970 --> 00:16:57.490
So you can see, this is
really in the visible range.

00:16:57.490 --> 00:16:59.770
605 would be right around here.

00:16:59.770 --> 00:17:02.950
And it has this bright kind
of orange fluorescence.

00:17:02.950 --> 00:17:04.329
And the wavelength
that you would

00:17:04.329 --> 00:17:07.390
use to irradiate
the dye on the DNA

00:17:07.390 --> 00:17:10.390
would be a shorter
wavelength than 605.

00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:12.099
You will often have
a prescription,

00:17:12.099 --> 00:17:15.970
excite at this wavelength so
you observe at this wavelength.

00:17:15.970 --> 00:17:18.770
And these are fixed
physical parameters

00:17:18.770 --> 00:17:21.550
for fluorescent molecules.

00:17:21.550 --> 00:17:27.790
Now, ethidium bromide is a
dye that can get into cells.

00:17:27.790 --> 00:17:30.790
And we can look at
DNA within cells.

00:17:30.790 --> 00:17:33.100
And here's a picture
of how it would look.

00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:35.410
So here's the ethidium bromide.

00:17:35.410 --> 00:17:39.328
And here's a pair of stacked
bases, this one and this one.

00:17:39.328 --> 00:17:40.870
And there he is,
right in the middle.

00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:44.560
See that ring coming
towards you is that.

00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:47.860
And then here's this
thing that slides straight

00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:51.130
between the bases and might
cause a little bit of a bulge.

00:17:51.130 --> 00:17:54.460
And we would call this
a DNA intercalator.

00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:56.650
It slides into the DNA.

00:17:56.650 --> 00:17:59.170
And you can see over here,
the structure of DNA.

00:17:59.170 --> 00:18:01.630
So you could picture
ethidium bromide

00:18:01.630 --> 00:18:03.770
sliding between the bases.

00:18:03.770 --> 00:18:06.100
Now, there's a big problem here.

00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:10.630
Because you can't use
DNA ethidium bromide.

00:18:10.630 --> 00:18:11.968
It's pretty toxic.

00:18:11.968 --> 00:18:12.885
Why would it be toxic?

00:18:18.210 --> 00:18:19.700
Well, no, it's not the bromide.

00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:22.880
It's the fact, more,
think of what the dye does

00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:24.350
when it gets to the DNA.

00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:27.290
What would that do to
things like replication

00:18:27.290 --> 00:18:28.850
and transcription?

00:18:28.850 --> 00:18:30.620
It just kind of messes it up.

00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:34.910
And so these are toxic dyes that
can only be used in fixed cells

00:18:34.910 --> 00:18:37.500
to do observations of cells.

00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:39.110
So we use it a lot.

00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:41.600
We need to be careful
of it because if it

00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:45.600
gets absorbed through our skin,
it could get into our cells.

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:47.630
And it could interfere
with replication

00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:49.430
and other cellular processes.

00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:51.980
Because it would accumulate
on our cellular DNA.

00:18:57.630 --> 00:19:00.350
And in fact, the
interesting thing

00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:03.020
that a lot of
molecules that actually

00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:05.630
have these sort of
flat, pancake shapes

00:19:05.630 --> 00:19:08.000
with lots of double
bonds are actually

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.130
pretty important in biology.

00:19:10.130 --> 00:19:13.490
Because they end up being
chemotherapeutic agents.

00:19:13.490 --> 00:19:15.890
So what I've shown
you here is what's

00:19:15.890 --> 00:19:18.230
known as an
anthracycline structure.

00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:20.870
I believe this is
adriamycin, I could be off.

00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:26.760
But it's a natural product
that's isolated from bacteria.

00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:29.210
And it has this
structure that also

00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:31.880
makes it a DNA intercalator.

00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:35.240
And it's used as a cancer
chemotherapeutic agent

00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:39.290
because it interferes with cell
division and proliferation.

00:19:39.290 --> 00:19:42.140
So we actually
exploit that property.

00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:46.670
But only with cells that we
want to kill or stop dividing.

00:19:46.670 --> 00:19:48.320
So you could picture,
well, I don't

00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:51.110
want to use something
that's going

00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:53.810
to interfere with cells if
I'm doing live cell imaging.

00:19:53.810 --> 00:19:56.120
Because I'm going to have
trouble with the properties

00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:57.128
of the cells.

00:19:57.128 --> 00:19:58.670
So fluorophores are
great, but you've

00:19:58.670 --> 00:20:03.200
got to worry about them because
they can get transferred

00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:05.840
through the skin, through
cellular membranes

00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:08.060
because they're
often quite greasy.

00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:10.070
And they can get
in and interfere

00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:12.650
with essential processes of DNA.

00:20:12.650 --> 00:20:16.220
So because of this, there's been
quite a revolution in the work

00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:20.270
done with DNA binding agents
that bind a little differently

00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:22.280
and are way less toxic.

00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:25.760
So I want to describe to you a
series of dyes that are known

00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:32.350
as DAPI and HOECHST,
H-O-E-C-H-S-T. This was,

00:20:32.350 --> 00:20:36.830
I believe, discovered in
a bio company in Germany.

00:20:36.830 --> 00:20:40.670
And these are different
kinds of dyes that

00:20:40.670 --> 00:20:43.130
fluoresce on binding to DNA.

00:20:43.130 --> 00:20:45.890
So they are still useful
in that same context.

00:20:45.890 --> 00:20:49.100
You can in fact substitute
ethidium bromide

00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:50.390
with these dyes.

00:20:50.390 --> 00:20:53.000
But they bind to DNA
pretty differently.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.430
And I want you to take a
look at these pictures.

00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:59.810
So here in green and blue-- and
apologies to the color blind--

00:20:59.810 --> 00:21:06.350
you see a molecule of this
compound here bound to DNA.

00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:10.100
So it's pretty clear it's
different from intercalation,

00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:11.060
right?

00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:16.080
You can see it's more sliding
around one part of the DNA.

00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:19.370
And when those molecules
bind to DNA in water,

00:21:19.370 --> 00:21:20.570
they don't fluorescence.

00:21:20.570 --> 00:21:24.410
When they bind to DNA they
fluorescent an intense cyan

00:21:24.410 --> 00:21:25.700
blue.

00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:28.205
So that's at a shorter
wavelength from the ethidium

00:21:28.205 --> 00:21:30.030
bromide.

00:21:30.030 --> 00:21:31.910
So taking a look
at this structure,

00:21:31.910 --> 00:21:36.140
does anyone want to explain
to me how the molecules might

00:21:36.140 --> 00:21:38.450
bind to DNA?

00:21:38.450 --> 00:21:41.270
We wouldn't call
it intercalation.

00:21:41.270 --> 00:21:46.190
We know intercalation is
perpendicular to the axis

00:21:46.190 --> 00:21:47.550
of the DNA.

00:21:47.550 --> 00:21:51.530
So where, looking at this,
do you think these bind?

00:21:51.530 --> 00:21:54.710
A while ago when I was talking
about the structure of DNA,

00:21:54.710 --> 00:22:00.050
I like to think of DNA as having
two grooves, two places where

00:22:00.050 --> 00:22:01.280
things combine to it.

00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:03.740
And that's a minor groove.

00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:07.190
And then this big trench is
what's called the major groove.

00:22:07.190 --> 00:22:09.740
And certain molecules
bind in one groove.

00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:11.437
And other molecules
bind in the other.

00:22:11.437 --> 00:22:12.770
Where do you think it's binding?

00:22:12.770 --> 00:22:13.850
Just by inspection.

00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:17.040
Yeah.

00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:18.110
AUDIENCE: Looks like
it's in the minor groove.

00:22:18.110 --> 00:22:21.200
PROFESSOR: That's correct, it's
just snuggled just perfectly

00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:22.105
in the minor groove.

00:22:22.105 --> 00:22:23.480
If it was in the
major groove, it

00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:25.310
would be swimming
around in that groove.

00:22:25.310 --> 00:22:27.290
It's almost too big.

00:22:27.290 --> 00:22:29.810
So what's really
cool about these dyes

00:22:29.810 --> 00:22:34.640
is they slide in between
into the minor groove.

00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:38.470
And they also make some
contacts with the phosphodiester

00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:38.970
backbone.

00:22:38.970 --> 00:22:41.990
But it's not that they're
dancing on the phosphodiester

00:22:41.990 --> 00:22:42.740
backbone.

00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:44.630
They're literally in the groove.

00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:48.290
But there's some opportunity
for electrostatic interactions.

00:22:48.290 --> 00:22:51.380
And so these compounds
would be known

00:22:51.380 --> 00:22:53.480
to bind in the minor groove.

00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:56.510
And in fact, they bind in
particular regions of DNA

00:22:56.510 --> 00:22:59.030
where there's AT, not GC.

00:22:59.030 --> 00:23:01.020
Those are the places
where there's just

00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:03.890
the pair of hydrogen
bonds instead of the trio.

00:23:03.890 --> 00:23:07.310
That's just their habit,
their personality.

00:23:07.310 --> 00:23:10.760
So chemistry was
very important here.

00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:13.370
You had a good dye,
but it was toxic.

00:23:13.370 --> 00:23:15.440
But improved dyes
came along that could

00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:18.800
be used in living systems
that are not toxic.

00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:20.690
Because if you bind
in those grooves

00:23:20.690 --> 00:23:22.670
and you're dissociating
easily, you're

00:23:22.670 --> 00:23:25.660
not going to interfere
so much with replication.

00:23:25.660 --> 00:23:27.500
Does that make sense?

00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:29.120
So it's a weaker force.

00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:31.970
It's not going to have a
big detrimental effect.

00:23:31.970 --> 00:23:33.620
Now, I moved this slide up.

00:23:33.620 --> 00:23:36.770
I realized he was in the
wrong place in the deck.

00:23:36.770 --> 00:23:42.700
This is just an application
of the DNA minor groove binder

00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:43.640
CEOCHST.

00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:47.450
And in this case, we're
looking at three cells.

00:23:47.450 --> 00:23:51.350
These two are not
actively dividing.

00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:53.540
But take a look
at this cell, it's

00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:59.480
actually clearly in the state
preparing for cell division.

00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:04.290
And what you can see here
is that in the nucleus,

00:24:04.290 --> 00:24:07.610
the DNA is pretty diffuse
before things really

00:24:07.610 --> 00:24:12.980
start to condense and line up
for DNA replication and cell

00:24:12.980 --> 00:24:13.940
division.

00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:16.970
And what's intriguing to
me is that this rather

00:24:16.970 --> 00:24:19.850
diffuse blue dye,
that's probably a bit

00:24:19.850 --> 00:24:22.400
more loosely
associated with DNA,

00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:25.520
becomes much clearer
and brighter when

00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:29.070
the chromosomes are in the state
they're in for cell division.

00:24:29.070 --> 00:24:30.940
So you can see them here.

00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:32.667
And one question here.

00:24:32.667 --> 00:24:34.250
So, if you're looking
at cells, you're

00:24:34.250 --> 00:24:36.860
trying to observe cells,
where else in the cell

00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:37.955
are you going to see DNA?

00:24:40.540 --> 00:24:42.730
So we can see the
nuclear DNA, we

00:24:42.730 --> 00:24:45.100
can see what stage of
the cell cycle it's in--

00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:45.790
Yeah, Carmen.

00:24:45.790 --> 00:24:46.630
AUDIENCE: The mitochondria.

00:24:46.630 --> 00:24:48.172
PROFESSOR: Yeah, in
the mitochondria.

00:24:48.172 --> 00:24:51.230
So you could also spot
that within the cell

00:24:51.230 --> 00:24:53.860
if you're at a
sufficient amplification.

00:24:53.860 --> 00:24:57.220
So you know that there's not
DNA running around everywhere.

00:24:57.220 --> 00:25:01.330
It's literally in very
specific places with the cell.

00:25:01.330 --> 00:25:06.010
These dyes will bind also
to other nucleic acids.

00:25:06.010 --> 00:25:07.540
But they don't bind so well.

00:25:07.540 --> 00:25:10.660
Because those don't have
the really repetitive,

00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:14.770
double stranded
nucleotide structures.

00:25:14.770 --> 00:25:18.820
But there are other dyes that
bind much more specifically

00:25:18.820 --> 00:25:19.600
to RNA.

00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:21.040
But we won't discuss them.

00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:22.930
So nucleic acids
seem to be something

00:25:22.930 --> 00:25:25.970
that we can definitely
pinpoint with fluorescence.

00:25:25.970 --> 00:25:27.310
We can see where it is.

00:25:27.310 --> 00:25:29.410
We could follow cell division.

00:25:29.410 --> 00:25:32.380
We could look to see the
progress of cell division.

00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:36.430
For example, upon adding
things to a cell, can you see--

00:25:36.430 --> 00:25:39.580
remember very, very
early on, we showed you

00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:41.410
movies of cells dividing.

00:25:41.410 --> 00:25:43.780
You could do that
with this kind of dye

00:25:43.780 --> 00:25:46.960
because it's a non-toxic dye.

00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:49.780
So, great, so far, so good.

00:25:49.780 --> 00:25:52.870
So the key thing,
though, about biology

00:25:52.870 --> 00:25:56.200
is we have so many other
entities within a cell

00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:59.080
that we want to be able
to track and monitor.

00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:02.500
And what we needed, what
is absolutely essential

00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:05.720
are reagents to do that.

00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:18.900
So I want to talk to you about
biological tools of monitoring.

00:26:21.978 --> 00:26:23.145
And you know what these are?

00:26:23.145 --> 00:26:26.520
These are antibodies,
monitoring proteins.

00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:30.120
And in fact, you can
also coax antibodies

00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:31.650
to recognize carbohydrates.

00:26:31.650 --> 00:26:33.330
So I'm going to
just put these here.

00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:43.270
But they're a little bit
harder to bind to antibodies.

00:26:43.270 --> 00:26:44.980
But nevertheless,
those are useful.

00:26:44.980 --> 00:26:48.620
So we're going to talk
now about antibodies,

00:26:48.620 --> 00:26:52.225
which are agents of the
human adaptive immune system.

00:27:10.620 --> 00:27:16.350
And how they have been exploited
intensively to study biology.

00:27:16.350 --> 00:27:20.880
Now, what you will learn
from Professor Martin in two

00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:23.310
or three lectures
time is much more

00:27:23.310 --> 00:27:26.340
about the nuts and bolts
of the immune cells,

00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:27.870
of the immune system.

00:27:27.870 --> 00:27:32.010
And how it mounts a response
to disease and other features.

00:27:32.010 --> 00:27:35.160
I'm going to focus completely
on the technological side

00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:37.470
of antibodies and
how they are useful

00:27:37.470 --> 00:27:39.990
reagents to study biology.

00:27:39.990 --> 00:27:44.460
Because if you want to
recognize a protein in a cell,

00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:48.270
you need a particular entity
that will bind to that protein

00:27:48.270 --> 00:27:50.850
and show you where it is
through some kind of signal,

00:27:50.850 --> 00:27:52.680
for example, fluorescence.

00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:55.650
So what I want to do is give
you the minimal description

00:27:55.650 --> 00:27:58.230
of antibodies so you
can understand this.

00:27:58.230 --> 00:28:00.600
But later you're
going to revisit it

00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:02.730
in a bit more complicated venue.

00:28:02.730 --> 00:28:04.830
But for the time
being, I'm just going

00:28:04.830 --> 00:28:12.970
to talk about B cells, which are
cells that produce antibodies.

00:28:17.090 --> 00:28:19.580
And I'm going to
talk to you about how

00:28:19.580 --> 00:28:22.730
they recognize their targets.

00:28:22.730 --> 00:28:25.850
Because what we have in
the adaptive immune system

00:28:25.850 --> 00:28:30.530
is an amazing system where you
can do combinatorial biology

00:28:30.530 --> 00:28:33.420
and basically recognize
any target entity

00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:34.730
you're interested in.

00:28:34.730 --> 00:28:37.790
So let's take a look at
this, keeping in mind

00:28:37.790 --> 00:28:40.490
that this is us
exploiting biology

00:28:40.490 --> 00:28:42.920
to make reagents to do biology.

00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:45.740
It's kind of a cool sort
of cyclical process.

00:28:45.740 --> 00:28:49.940
So the cells of the
hematopoietic immune--

00:28:49.940 --> 00:28:52.910
sorry the hematopoietic system,
those are the ones that are

00:28:52.910 --> 00:28:57.680
important in blood cells,
form a lot of different--

00:28:57.680 --> 00:28:59.750
wait a minute, I'm on triple--

00:28:59.750 --> 00:29:00.960
triple tools here.

00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:02.660
There are a bunch
of different cells

00:29:02.660 --> 00:29:05.840
that are produced from the
pluripotent hematopoietic

00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:06.480
cells.

00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:09.410
They're either the white
cells or the red cell types.

00:29:09.410 --> 00:29:13.470
But what we're going to focus
right in on are the B cells.

00:29:13.470 --> 00:29:15.530
These are the cells of
the immune system that

00:29:15.530 --> 00:29:18.350
produce soluble antibodies, OK.

00:29:21.260 --> 00:29:25.160
And when you challenge
a B cell population

00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:29.330
with a foreign entity,
the B cell population

00:29:29.330 --> 00:29:32.560
will go into gear to
produce antibodies

00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:37.220
that very specifically recognize
that foreign target, because

00:29:37.220 --> 00:29:39.800
in the human adaptive
immune system, that

00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:44.190
might be a wonderful tool to
get rid of that foreign entity.

00:29:44.190 --> 00:29:45.830
So we're going to
focus exclusively

00:29:45.830 --> 00:29:49.430
on the B cells and the
way that they mature

00:29:49.430 --> 00:29:52.760
to produce soluble antibodies,
those are down at the bottom

00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:56.120
here, based on what they've
been challenged with.

00:29:56.120 --> 00:29:58.880
So what this little
schematic shows you is you

00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:02.780
have a bunch of
different B cells.

00:30:02.780 --> 00:30:05.150
And there's something
you want to recognize.

00:30:05.150 --> 00:30:08.770
Let's just say it's a molecule--

00:30:08.770 --> 00:30:11.540
an EGF molecule, a cytokine.

00:30:11.540 --> 00:30:15.170
What you might do is
challenge this population

00:30:15.170 --> 00:30:16.700
with the cytokine.

00:30:16.700 --> 00:30:20.630
Only one B cell type will
bind to the cytokine.

00:30:20.630 --> 00:30:23.130
And then that will
get amplified.

00:30:23.130 --> 00:30:25.700
And then you will
end up with B cells

00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:28.010
that produce a
lot of an antibody

00:30:28.010 --> 00:30:31.610
to a cytokine such as EGF.

00:30:31.610 --> 00:30:34.280
I'm truly dumbing this down.

00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:36.140
I just want you to
get the gist of it

00:30:36.140 --> 00:30:38.750
for the purpose of
this discussion.

00:30:38.750 --> 00:30:42.940
Now B cells adopt a
very classical shape.

00:30:42.940 --> 00:30:47.270
And I'm just going to show you
the quaternary structure of a B

00:30:47.270 --> 00:30:47.810
cell--

00:30:47.810 --> 00:30:54.140
of an antibody in
linear form here.

00:30:54.140 --> 00:30:56.630
So it doesn't look very
exciting right now.

00:30:56.630 --> 00:31:06.040
There are two light
chains, which I've just

00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:08.410
shown in schematic form.

00:31:08.410 --> 00:31:11.440
These are just
polypeptide chains.

00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:13.060
And there are two heavy chains.

00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:22.820
All right, so that's
their basic structure.

00:31:22.820 --> 00:31:25.940
It's held together in
a stable quarternary

00:31:25.940 --> 00:31:28.940
structure with this complex.

00:31:28.940 --> 00:31:33.200
And there may be disulfides
across and throughout

00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:34.280
the structure.

00:31:34.280 --> 00:31:36.530
Now what's so special
about antibodies?

00:31:36.530 --> 00:31:38.360
They're pretty big molecules.

00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:40.100
The molecular weight
is pretty high.

00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:46.700
But the key thing
about antibodies

00:31:46.700 --> 00:31:53.910
is that the majority
of the structure

00:31:53.910 --> 00:31:55.455
stays fairly constant.

00:31:58.080 --> 00:31:59.300
So I'm just going to--

00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:05.760
so this doesn't get modified
when B cells mature.

00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:10.640
But another part of the
structure is variable.

00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:17.680
And when B cells
mature, there's loads

00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:20.860
of rearranging in that
variable section in order

00:32:20.860 --> 00:32:24.050
that it adapt to bind to target.

00:32:24.050 --> 00:32:26.890
So what you've seen here
is that the target--

00:32:26.890 --> 00:32:28.660
see if this little
fellow works anymore.

00:32:28.660 --> 00:32:29.160
No.

00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:30.730
Ah.

00:32:30.730 --> 00:32:32.890
What you see here
is the light chain

00:32:32.890 --> 00:32:35.990
in green, heavy chain in blue.

00:32:35.990 --> 00:32:37.460
And it's a double version of it.

00:32:37.460 --> 00:32:39.910
We always draw antibodies
as this V shape.

00:32:39.910 --> 00:32:49.890
And an antigen-- you've
heard this word before--

00:32:49.890 --> 00:32:53.625
it's a foreign entity that's
foreign to the immune system.

00:33:02.490 --> 00:33:08.390
The antigen binding
site is right here

00:33:08.390 --> 00:33:11.890
at the tips of the antibody.

00:33:11.890 --> 00:33:15.200
And I think the picture up
there is kind of clearer.

00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:16.540
Let's put that forward again.

00:33:16.540 --> 00:33:19.630
And you can see very
specifically the structure.

00:33:19.630 --> 00:33:22.120
The C's designate
constant regions.

00:33:27.930 --> 00:33:30.360
See C all the way through here.

00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:34.290
And V's represent variable
regions, which I've shown you.

00:33:34.290 --> 00:33:37.620
And at the tip of the V's are
the antigen binding sites.

00:33:37.620 --> 00:33:39.780
So you're going to see
more about antibodies

00:33:39.780 --> 00:33:41.252
in the immune system.

00:33:41.252 --> 00:33:42.960
But what you want to
accept is that these

00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:47.040
are biological macromolecules
that particularly evolved

00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:49.710
to recognize target antigens.

00:33:49.710 --> 00:33:55.660
And you can use them reliably
as biological reagents.

00:33:55.660 --> 00:33:59.110
All right, so how do you
achieve the diversity?

00:33:59.110 --> 00:34:02.290
There are hundreds of thousands
of different antibodies

00:34:02.290 --> 00:34:03.850
in the human system.

00:34:03.850 --> 00:34:07.540
If we had a gene for every
single different light

00:34:07.540 --> 00:34:11.080
chain and every heavy
chain, you know, our DNA

00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:13.090
would be completely
swamped by being

00:34:13.090 --> 00:34:17.679
dedicated to the genetic
material for antibodies.

00:34:17.679 --> 00:34:20.949
So instead there is
a particular system

00:34:20.949 --> 00:34:25.840
which provides little
portions of the DNA structure

00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:29.210
that are in little pieces
of variable components

00:34:29.210 --> 00:34:33.440
that can get zipped together
through transcription

00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:37.810
and slicing events to give you
a bunch of antibodies that have

00:34:37.810 --> 00:34:40.389
different variable regions.

00:34:40.389 --> 00:34:42.850
And this is what's
known as the BDJ system.

00:34:42.850 --> 00:34:46.120
And you'll hear more about
that from Professor Martin.

00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:48.070
So basically what you
want to think about

00:34:48.070 --> 00:34:52.659
is it's a combinatorial system
to take little pieces of DNA

00:34:52.659 --> 00:34:55.510
into a super molecular
structure to give you

00:34:55.510 --> 00:34:59.320
antibody combining sites
that can recognize virtually

00:34:59.320 --> 00:35:00.880
any target.

00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:02.480
Anyone got any questions here?

00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:06.630
I'm seeing a few worried faces.

00:35:06.630 --> 00:35:08.550
Somebody ask me
a question if you

00:35:08.550 --> 00:35:10.830
feel I could clarify
a component of this

00:35:10.830 --> 00:35:11.970
or are you OK with this?

00:35:15.610 --> 00:35:18.150
Anybody?

00:35:18.150 --> 00:35:20.060
OK, I'll move forward.

00:35:23.050 --> 00:35:25.600
So we talked about antibodies.

00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:27.670
When you get a
population of B cells

00:35:27.670 --> 00:35:33.550
that produce antibodies
to a particular target,

00:35:33.550 --> 00:35:36.070
these may be what are
known as polyclonal--

00:35:41.283 --> 00:35:43.700
a polyclonal-- sorry, I should
have written that up here--

00:35:43.700 --> 00:35:52.970
a polyclonal antibody, as
might be suggested by the name,

00:35:52.970 --> 00:35:54.350
is an antibody--

00:35:54.350 --> 00:35:58.460
let's say it recognizes
a molecular entity.

00:35:58.460 --> 00:36:00.010
So the antibodies--

00:36:00.010 --> 00:36:03.520
I'm going to draw them as
little y shaped molecules--

00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:09.970
may recognize different parts
of the antigen. So antibody A,

00:36:09.970 --> 00:36:13.660
B, C recognize different
parts of the antigen.

00:36:13.660 --> 00:36:15.280
Those would be polyclonal.

00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:19.750
It would be a mixed bag
of antibody molecules

00:36:19.750 --> 00:36:22.750
that shows specificity
for a target.

00:36:22.750 --> 00:36:27.156
But people also tend
to use a great deal

00:36:27.156 --> 00:36:34.700
of monoclonal
antibodies, because they

00:36:34.700 --> 00:36:36.500
are a lot more specific.

00:36:36.500 --> 00:36:40.780
So if you had a selection
of polyclonal antibodies,

00:36:40.780 --> 00:36:44.330
a monoclonal antibody would
be a single population

00:36:44.330 --> 00:36:47.600
that recognizes a single
antigen or epitope

00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:49.520
in your antigenic molecule.

00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:53.510
And the way those are made is
through the engineering method

00:36:53.510 --> 00:36:57.170
where you fuse spleen
cells with myeloma cells.

00:36:57.170 --> 00:36:59.360
And then you get a hybrid--

00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:03.050
what are known as hybridomas
that produce very specifically

00:37:03.050 --> 00:37:05.210
just monoclonal antibodies.

00:37:05.210 --> 00:37:07.850
So that's a bit of background
there about the antibodies.

00:37:07.850 --> 00:37:11.240
You'll see it on the rerun
when Professor Martin talks.

00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:14.150
But I just wanted to give you
a bit of exposure to this.

00:37:14.150 --> 00:37:18.360
So let's now look at how
antibodies can be useful.

00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:21.290
So let's say you want to
visualize in a cell-- let's

00:37:21.290 --> 00:37:24.050
move straight to a real
targeted application.

00:37:24.050 --> 00:37:27.680
We want to make an antibody
that might recognize actin

00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:31.100
and a different antibody
that might recognize tubulin

00:37:31.100 --> 00:37:35.930
to take a look at cells through
the use of antibody structures.

00:37:35.930 --> 00:37:39.860
The way you generate antibodies
is through laboratory animals.

00:37:39.860 --> 00:37:43.700
And very commonly we use
either mice or rabbits

00:37:43.700 --> 00:37:45.290
for antibody production.

00:37:47.810 --> 00:37:51.830
The rabbit is used when you need
a lot more antibody material.

00:37:51.830 --> 00:37:55.020
The mouse will satisfy
for some experiments.

00:37:55.020 --> 00:37:59.970
So the way you make
antibodies is by injecting.

00:37:59.970 --> 00:38:03.530
So this would be the
foreign agent or antigen

00:38:03.530 --> 00:38:05.570
that you want to
make an antibody to,

00:38:05.570 --> 00:38:09.020
which would normally bind
at the variable region

00:38:09.020 --> 00:38:11.390
of this immunoglobulin molecule.

00:38:11.390 --> 00:38:14.510
You inject the mouse
with that antigen. Excuse

00:38:14.510 --> 00:38:15.533
me-- that's a rabbit.

00:38:15.533 --> 00:38:17.450
You know, I haven't been
in biology very long.

00:38:17.450 --> 00:38:20.430
But I can tell that's
a rabbit, right?

00:38:20.430 --> 00:38:26.185
Anyway, so you inject the
rabbit with a human protein.

00:38:26.185 --> 00:38:27.560
If you-- what
would happen if you

00:38:27.560 --> 00:38:35.450
injected the rabbit with rabbit
actin or with rabbit tubulin?

00:38:35.450 --> 00:38:40.600
What would you-- would you
expect to see a response?

00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:41.430
No, right?

00:38:41.430 --> 00:38:42.150
Yeah.

00:38:42.150 --> 00:38:45.840
Because the
organisms are adapted

00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:48.510
not to recognize
their own proteins

00:38:48.510 --> 00:38:51.850
unless there's some disorder
like an autoimmune disease.

00:38:51.850 --> 00:38:56.470
So you would inject the
rabbit with a human epitope,

00:38:56.470 --> 00:39:00.300
so for example human
actin, generate antibodies

00:39:00.300 --> 00:39:03.150
with a specificity
for actin, and then

00:39:03.150 --> 00:39:06.930
you would label those antibodies
with a fluorescent marker,

00:39:06.930 --> 00:39:10.290
so you could track it or
follow it through chemistry.

00:39:10.290 --> 00:39:13.620
Alternatively, you might want
to make a different antibody

00:39:13.620 --> 00:39:14.970
for tubulin.

00:39:14.970 --> 00:39:18.750
And then you would differentiate
the antibody against tubulin

00:39:18.750 --> 00:39:21.720
from the antibody against
actin by labeling it

00:39:21.720 --> 00:39:24.000
with a different
color fluorophore.

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:27.390
So you've really got two
types of macromolecule

00:39:27.390 --> 00:39:30.210
that can be interacted
with a fixed cell

00:39:30.210 --> 00:39:32.490
and recognize those
two macromolecules

00:39:32.490 --> 00:39:33.570
within the protein.

00:39:33.570 --> 00:39:35.670
So what's important
here is that you

00:39:35.670 --> 00:39:38.400
don't use the protein from--

00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:40.590
if you want to
study human cells,

00:39:40.590 --> 00:39:43.800
you use antibodies produced
in rabbit or mouse.

00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:45.900
If you want to
study rabbit cells,

00:39:45.900 --> 00:39:48.500
you could produce it
in different organisms.

00:39:48.500 --> 00:39:52.250
You're not going to produce the
antibodies in the same host.

00:39:52.250 --> 00:39:53.900
Nowadays-- yes.

00:39:53.900 --> 00:39:56.854
AUDIENCE: How do you know that
you have the correct antibody,

00:39:56.854 --> 00:40:00.600
like if that is the right one?

00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:01.770
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:40:01.770 --> 00:40:05.220
OK, so you would prepare the--

00:40:05.220 --> 00:40:07.050
you would do them.

00:40:07.050 --> 00:40:09.150
There's a lot of
screening takes place.

00:40:09.150 --> 00:40:11.670
So you inject the
mouse or rabbit.

00:40:11.670 --> 00:40:13.260
And then you collect the serum.

00:40:13.260 --> 00:40:15.510
And you look for
whether the serum

00:40:15.510 --> 00:40:17.820
gets enriched and
enriched in antibodies

00:40:17.820 --> 00:40:20.040
that recognize the target.

00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:23.280
So you'll see an increase in
what's known as the titer.

00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:26.040
And then once you get
a high titer, you'll--

00:40:26.040 --> 00:40:28.950
unfortunately, you can
just collect the serum

00:40:28.950 --> 00:40:31.440
or depending if you
want to make monoclonal,

00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:34.380
you'd have to sacrifice the
animal to get the spleen cells.

00:40:34.380 --> 00:40:36.660
But then you collect
the antibodies

00:40:36.660 --> 00:40:38.340
through an affinity
method that's

00:40:38.340 --> 00:40:40.380
directed just at antibodies.

00:40:40.380 --> 00:40:41.790
Then you've got your population.

00:40:41.790 --> 00:40:44.400
And you can throw a
fluorophore dye at it

00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:45.600
and chemically label it.

00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:47.280
So it's a good point there.

00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:48.840
There's a lot of
work being done now

00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:51.660
with antibodies from
different organisms, in fact,

00:40:51.660 --> 00:40:53.700
you'll see them from camels.

00:40:53.700 --> 00:40:55.743
And they're also
ones from shark.

00:40:55.743 --> 00:40:57.660
And the reason why they're
kind of interesting

00:40:57.660 --> 00:41:00.630
is that they sort of have mini
antibodies that are much more

00:41:00.630 --> 00:41:02.590
useful for technology.

00:41:02.590 --> 00:41:05.020
So let's see what
we can do here.

00:41:05.020 --> 00:41:08.100
We can do fluorescence
experiments.

00:41:08.100 --> 00:41:10.450
In order to do this
with an antibody.

00:41:10.450 --> 00:41:13.890
And this is going to highlight
a shortcoming of antibodies.

00:41:13.890 --> 00:41:15.420
You may take a
cell that you want

00:41:15.420 --> 00:41:18.310
to observe different
proteins in that cell,

00:41:18.310 --> 00:41:21.750
you have to fix the cell
to make it permeable.

00:41:21.750 --> 00:41:25.200
Why do I need to make
the cell permeable

00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:27.450
in order to use these
antibody reagents?

00:41:33.330 --> 00:41:36.770
Do you think the antibodies
are just going to cross--

00:41:36.770 --> 00:41:38.820
DAPI gets into a cell easily.

00:41:38.820 --> 00:41:41.860
But what about antibodies?

00:41:41.860 --> 00:41:43.570
Can they cross the
plasma membrane

00:41:43.570 --> 00:41:45.340
to get into the cell
to label a target?

00:41:48.530 --> 00:41:49.970
What do you think?

00:41:49.970 --> 00:41:53.020
Who says yes?

00:41:53.020 --> 00:41:54.140
Who says no?

00:41:54.140 --> 00:41:54.750
Good.

00:41:54.750 --> 00:41:55.580
Thank goodness.

00:41:55.580 --> 00:41:56.110
OK.

00:41:56.110 --> 00:41:57.110
You guys don't say much.

00:41:57.110 --> 00:41:58.610
But I know you know
the answer here.

00:41:58.610 --> 00:42:00.260
They just can't
float into cells.

00:42:00.260 --> 00:42:02.430
They're too large
to get into cells.

00:42:02.430 --> 00:42:04.940
So you have to fix the
cells on a glass side

00:42:04.940 --> 00:42:09.940
and permeabilize them,
for example, with methanol

00:42:09.940 --> 00:42:12.230
so that the antibodies
can gain access

00:42:12.230 --> 00:42:14.010
to all parts of the cell.

00:42:14.010 --> 00:42:17.570
So here is a bright
field view of cells.

00:42:17.570 --> 00:42:20.270
That's a little
bit more specific.

00:42:20.270 --> 00:42:21.740
That's OK too.

00:42:21.740 --> 00:42:23.780
But this is what I
really want to show you.

00:42:23.780 --> 00:42:28.280
This is what you could achieve
with DAPI and an antibody

00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:31.190
to the actin and an
antibody to tubulin.

00:42:31.190 --> 00:42:33.290
And you can look at
the various colors

00:42:33.290 --> 00:42:35.000
of the fluorescence emission.

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:39.650
And you see here what you've
got is an anti-actin antibody

00:42:39.650 --> 00:42:40.580
with a red dye.

00:42:40.580 --> 00:42:43.850
And you can see that at the
perimeters of the cells.

00:42:43.850 --> 00:42:47.420
You've got an anti-tubulin
antibody with a green dye.

00:42:47.420 --> 00:42:51.980
And you can see the
filamentous structure there.

00:42:51.980 --> 00:42:55.040
And then you've got DAPI
staining bright blue

00:42:55.040 --> 00:42:56.290
where the nuclei are.

00:42:56.290 --> 00:42:58.910
So you have three
unique labels that

00:42:58.910 --> 00:43:00.590
fluoresce at
different wavelengths

00:43:00.590 --> 00:43:02.810
and you can directly
pinpoint things.

00:43:02.810 --> 00:43:06.430
So fluorescence is extremely
valuable for looking

00:43:06.430 --> 00:43:09.760
a biological systems, because
we don't have a lot that

00:43:09.760 --> 00:43:11.120
fluoresces in the body.

00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:14.360
So a cell in general, if
you irradiate it with light,

00:43:14.360 --> 00:43:17.240
you won't see any major
fluorescence at all.

00:43:17.240 --> 00:43:21.050
So these reagents that
you use to study biology,

00:43:21.050 --> 00:43:24.470
if they fluoresce, you've got
unique signals where you can

00:43:24.470 --> 00:43:28.040
look at really complicated
cells that may have thousands

00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:31.010
and thousands of proteins,
sugars, nucleic acids,

00:43:31.010 --> 00:43:34.760
and very specifically see
things by fluorescence

00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:38.510
because the fluorescence is
a unique signal in biology

00:43:38.510 --> 00:43:41.960
relative to the intrinsic
fluorescence of proteins

00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:43.730
or rather macromolecules.

00:43:43.730 --> 00:43:47.390
We have tryptophan and tyrosine,
a couple of amino acids.

00:43:47.390 --> 00:43:49.670
They fluoresce, but it's so dim.

00:43:49.670 --> 00:43:50.870
It's nothing like this.

00:43:50.870 --> 00:43:53.780
You wouldn't see those
kinds of signals at all.

00:43:53.780 --> 00:43:57.410
It's really what we call
extrinsic fluorophores,

00:43:57.410 --> 00:44:01.190
fluorophores from outside that
shine very, very brightly.

00:44:01.190 --> 00:44:03.770
Many of these fluorophores
shine so brightly they

00:44:03.770 --> 00:44:07.280
can be used to look at
in single molecules--

00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:08.930
professor Martin
described to you

00:44:08.930 --> 00:44:11.750
single molecule DNA sequencing.

00:44:11.750 --> 00:44:15.080
That actually exploits
very bright fluorophores

00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:17.450
that is so bright that you
can see just a few of them

00:44:17.450 --> 00:44:20.900
in one place very, very clearly.

00:44:20.900 --> 00:44:22.700
OK, how am I doing?

00:44:22.700 --> 00:44:24.800
I just want to
actually leave you

00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:27.410
with something that's
another technology.

00:44:27.410 --> 00:44:29.420
So you could almost picture--

00:44:29.420 --> 00:44:33.460
with all of what
we've seen so far,

00:44:33.460 --> 00:44:39.560
you could almost target any
cell with an antibody that's

00:44:39.560 --> 00:44:42.170
specifically raised to a
particular protein that's

00:44:42.170 --> 00:44:43.400
within the cell.

00:44:43.400 --> 00:44:45.260
So we can see--

00:44:45.260 --> 00:44:48.210
in the next class we'll discuss
what the limitations of that

00:44:48.210 --> 00:44:48.710
are.

00:44:48.710 --> 00:44:50.780
But we've already
talked about the fact

00:44:50.780 --> 00:44:54.940
that we have to use antibodies
with fixed, not living anymore,

00:44:54.940 --> 00:44:55.760
cells.

00:44:55.760 --> 00:44:59.040
So they are really dyes that
can only be used in that way.

00:44:59.040 --> 00:45:01.220
The other place you
can use fluorophores

00:45:01.220 --> 00:45:04.910
is for labeling DNA and
from looking at DNA.

00:45:04.910 --> 00:45:07.880
And a particularly
important technology

00:45:07.880 --> 00:45:12.410
is known as a DNA microarray
has anybody heard of these?

00:45:12.410 --> 00:45:12.920
Yeah.

00:45:12.920 --> 00:45:17.690
So DNA microarrays absolutely
exploits the complementarity

00:45:17.690 --> 00:45:19.080
of DNA sequences.

00:45:19.080 --> 00:45:22.730
So if you want to probe for
a particular sequence of DNA,

00:45:22.730 --> 00:45:25.490
you would make the
complementary strand

00:45:25.490 --> 00:45:27.350
and label it with a fluorophore.

00:45:27.350 --> 00:45:31.730
And new could, out of thousands
of DNA stretches, literally

00:45:31.730 --> 00:45:33.830
light up the stretch
of DNA that's

00:45:33.830 --> 00:45:36.080
complementary to your target.

00:45:36.080 --> 00:45:38.270
And so DNA microarrays--

00:45:38.270 --> 00:45:40.040
what you see here
are just the size

00:45:40.040 --> 00:45:42.350
of just a microscope slide.

00:45:42.350 --> 00:45:47.690
On this slide through
arranged technologies,

00:45:47.690 --> 00:45:53.570
you can literally spot 40,000
distinct sequences of DNA

00:45:53.570 --> 00:45:55.580
in grids to recognize.

00:45:55.580 --> 00:45:58.400
So these DNA
microarrays can be used

00:45:58.400 --> 00:46:04.040
for profiling genetic material
or for profiling not just DNA,

00:46:04.040 --> 00:46:06.590
but RNA, and we'll see
how at the beginning

00:46:06.590 --> 00:46:10.700
of the next class, in order to
probe for particular stretches

00:46:10.700 --> 00:46:14.240
of DNA that might
be disease related

00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:17.810
and have single
nucleotide polymorphisms.

00:46:17.810 --> 00:46:20.870
So in order to actually just
give you a little bit of a warm

00:46:20.870 --> 00:46:23.180
up to that, I want you to go--

00:46:23.180 --> 00:46:25.640
I'm going to put a link
to this in the web site.

00:46:25.640 --> 00:46:30.380
And it actually just shows
you a virtual running of a DNA

00:46:30.380 --> 00:46:32.300
microarray experiments
and how you

00:46:32.300 --> 00:46:35.090
can use it to profile
disease states

00:46:35.090 --> 00:46:37.760
and cells versus healthy cells.

00:46:37.760 --> 00:46:39.930
And then at the beginning
of the next class,

00:46:39.930 --> 00:46:42.680
I'll describe how you
get information out

00:46:42.680 --> 00:46:44.270
of DNA microarrays.

00:46:44.270 --> 00:46:46.520
But at the end of
the day, you're

00:46:46.520 --> 00:46:49.700
always using the
fluorophores as the probes

00:46:49.700 --> 00:46:52.090
for where certain
things are, OK.

00:46:52.090 --> 00:46:53.860
And the thing to remember here.

00:46:53.860 --> 00:46:56.290
Fluorescence is a
magnificent tool.

00:46:56.290 --> 00:46:58.610
We can use fluorophores
on their own.

00:46:58.610 --> 00:47:01.390
We can use fluorophores
as attached to antibodies.

00:47:01.390 --> 00:47:03.400
And the DNA
microarray experiments

00:47:03.400 --> 00:47:05.590
show you how you
can use fluorophores

00:47:05.590 --> 00:47:08.340
attached to DNA sequences, OK.

00:47:08.340 --> 00:47:10.880
And I'll see you
in the next class.

WEBVTT

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
All right.
Let's get started.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I guess this watch is a couple
minutes fast.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:27.000
First a quick announcement.
In case you have forgotten,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.000
your lab notebooks are due
tomorrow with the post-lab

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:41.000
exercises for the first lab.
OK, so I am going to continue

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
with amplifiers today.
And to just give you a sense of

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
where we headed,
we have this five lecture

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
sequence covering different
aspects of amplifiers with

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000
dependent sources and showed how
we could build an amplifier with

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
it on Tuesday.
Today I am going to show you a

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
real device that implements a
dependent source.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.000
And then next Tuesday we will
talk about analysis of an

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
amplifier.
Wednesday is our quiz.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Thursday and the Tuesday after
that we then talk about small

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:30.000
signal analysis and small signal
use of the amplifier.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Today we will talk about the
MOSFET amplifier.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
So let's start with a quick
review.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
And in the last lecture,
I showed you that I could build

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
a amplifier using a dependent
source.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
And a dependent source worked
as follows.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Let's say I had a circuit and I
connected a dependent source

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000
into the circuit.
Let's say in this example I

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:28.000
have a current source.
So this is some circuit.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
And the current i is a function
of some parameter in the

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
circuit.
That's why this is a dependent

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
source.
This is a dependent current

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
source.
So it could be that I have some

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
element inside.
And I measure,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000
I sample the voltage across the
element or between any two

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.000
points in the circuit.
And, in this little example

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:03.000
here, this current could be
dependent on that voltage.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
So notice that although I
showed you the two terminals of

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
the dependent source that
carried a current,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000
there is another implicit port,
another implicit terminal

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
there.
And that terminal there is

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000
called the "control port" of the
dependent source at which I

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
apply a voltage or current that
will control the value of the

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000
current source.
As a quick aside.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
There is a small glitch with
the tools in your tool chest.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
We talked about the
superposition technique where

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
you were taught to turn on one
source at a time,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:56.000
for a linear circuit one source
at a time, and then sum up the

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.000
responses to all the sources
acting one at a time.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
Well, what do you do about
dependent sources?

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.000
A dependent source is a source.
And we have to modify the

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
superposition statement just a
little bit.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.000
And for details you can look at
Section 3.5.1 of your course

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000
notes on the details and some
examples on how to do this.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
So the approach is very simple,
actually.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
The approach is,
for the purpose of

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
superposition,
to not treat your dependent

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:36.000
source as sources that you turn
on and turn off.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
So what you do is when you do
superposition with dependent

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000
sources simply leave all your
dependent sources in the

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
circuit.
Just leave them in there and

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
turn on and off only your
independent sources.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
So look at the response of the
circuit by turning on your

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000
independent sources one at a
time and summing up the

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000
responses.
And your dependent sources stay

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000
within the circuit and simply
analyze them as you do anything

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
else.
So essentially what it says is

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.000
that just be a little cautious
when you have dependent sources,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000
but the basic method applies
almost without any change.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:22.000
The readings for today's
lecture are Section 7.3 to 7.6.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.000
So since we are going to build
up on the dependent source

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:39.000
amplifier, let me start with a
quick review of that amplifier.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000
We built our amplifier as
follows.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000
We connected our dependent
source in the following manner.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000
And the current through the
dependent source in the example

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000
we took was related to an input
voltage vI.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000
So some voltage vI.
And so these two were the

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.000
control port of the dependent
source and a vI was applied

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
there.
And I showed you a simple

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:30.000
amplifier built with a dependent
source that behaved in this

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000
manner.
And again I will keep reminding

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000
you, just remember that the
dependent source is actually

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
this box here,
the control port and the output

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
port.
And commonly we don't

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.000
explicitly show the control port
for those dependent sources for

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000
which the control port does not
have any other affect on the

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:58.000
circuit, like it doesn't draw
any current or things like that.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:04.000
So in this particular example
we said that this behaved in the

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:11.000
following manner for vI greater
than or equal to 1 volt and iD

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
was zero otherwise.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:26.000
So we can analyze the circuit
to figure out what vO is going

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:31.000
to look like.
And a simple application of KVL

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
at this loop here,
again, you know,

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000
when I say this loop here,
I am pointing at something

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
here.
That is the VS source that is

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
implicitly across these two
nodes.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.000
Again, this is a shorthand
notation where this little up

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:51.000
arrow here implies that I have a
voltage source connected between

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.000
these two terminals here.
And so there is a loop here

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:00.000
that involves VS.
So Vo is simply VS minus the

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.000
drop across this resistor.
So it's VS minus the drop

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
across this resistor gives me
vO.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:13.000
And the drop across the
resistor is simply iD RL.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000
iD is the current here and
that's the drop across the

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000
resistor.
And I could get the explicit

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:27.000
relationship of vO versus vI by
substituting for iD as vI minus

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:32.000
one all squared.
So vO relates to vI in the

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
following manner.
Nothing new so far.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:41.000
I have pretty much reviewed
what we did the last time.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:46.000
Here is where we take our next
step forward with some new

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000
material.
Up to now I have talked as a

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:55.000
theoretician would where I said
just imagine that you had

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:00.000
spherical cow or something like
that.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
Here I just asked you to
imagine this ideal dependent

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.000
source, control port and an
output port, and it behaved in

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
this manner.
So as a next step what I would

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000
like to do is show you a
practical dependent source which

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
turns out to be a little bit
more complicated than this

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:22.000
idealized dependent source that
I showed you in many dimensions.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000
Real life tends to impose a
bunch of practical constraints

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:30.000
on you, and we will look at
those in a second.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:37.000
If I could find a dependent
source that looked like this --

00:09:52.000 --> 00:10:00.000
We had a control port A prime
and output port B prime.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.000
And I looked at some examples
where the current through the

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:10.000
dependent current source was
some function of the input

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
voltage.
This is a "voltage controlled

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.000
current source".
What I am going to do is talk

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:22.000
about a device that can give me
this behavior or some close

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:27.000
approximation to it.
It turns out that under certain

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:32.000
conditions the MOSFET that you
have already looked at behaves

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:38.000
in this manner.
The MOSFET that you've seen

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:44.000
sort of behaves like this.
And let me show you under what

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:49.000
conditions the MOSFET behaves in
that manner.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
Let me create some room for
myself.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:11:00.000
Notice that I need a control
port, needed an output port.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000
And I am going to view my
MOSFET in a slightly different

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
manner than you have seen
before.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
I draw these two terminals
here.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
And this was a three terminal
MOSFET.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.000
This was my drain,
my gate and my source terminal.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:21.000
It was a three terminal device,
but what I do is I view the

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.000
MOSFET slightly differently.
I will just use this terminal

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:31.000
to be common across both the
gate and the drain.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
And so this voltage here is
vGS.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:39.000
I am just using the source
port, the source terminal along

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
with the gate as a terminal
pair.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:48.000
I am using the same source
along with the drain as another

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000
terminal pair.
So I have a vDS out there and I

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:58.000
have some current iDS that flows
out here.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:03.000
Notice that when I view the
MOSFET in this manner I have

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:09.000
accomplished my first step,
which is I seem to have a box

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.000
which has a port here and a port
here.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:18.000
And I also explained to you
that a MOSFET behaves in a

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.000
particular manner.
For one, the output port

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:30.000
behaved as an open circuit under
certain conditions when --

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
This was vGS,
G, drain and source.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:39.000
When vGS was less than a
threshold voltage VT this MOSFET

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:44.000
had an equivalent circuit that
looked like this.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:50.000
So when vGS was less than some
threshold voltage VT then there

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:56.000
was an open circuit between the
drain and the source.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:02.000
And you saw this before.
So far nothing new here.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:08.000
However, when vGS is greater
than or equal to VT --

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000
vGS was greater than VT.
The MOSFET behavior we looked

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.000
at earlier showed that this
behaved either like a short

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:29.000
circuit in the simplest form or
in a slightly more detailed form

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:34.000
it behaved like a resistor.
We call that the SR model of

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
the MOSFET.
So when vGS was greater than VT

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:42.000
we said that a simple way to
approximate MOSFET behavior was

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.000
to view this as a resistor
connected between the drain and

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000
the source.
That was our SR model use of

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000
the MOSFET.
It turns out that we kind of

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
lied.
We were sort of looking at the

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:00.000
MOSFET in a really funny way.
And I shone the light on the

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
MOSFET in a really,
really clever way.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
Well, I shouldn't say clever.
A really, really tricky way.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:10.000
And tricked you into believing
that it was just a resistor.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
And we constrained how you use
the MOSFET.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
So that behavior was indeed a
resistive behavior.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000
But it turns out that in real
life the behavior of the MOSFET

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000
between the drain and the source
terminals is much more

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
complicated than the limited
form in which you saw it.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.000
So today what I am going to do
is take the wraps off the

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.000
complete MOSFET and show you its
full behavior in all its gory

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.000
glory.
And I will spend a bit of time

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:44.000
on that to clearly emphasize
under what conditions the MOSFET

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:49.000
behaves like a resistor,
as you saw when you did digital

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:54.000
circuits, or behaves differently
in other domains of use.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:00.000
Let me pause for a second and
leave this space blank here.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
And let's do some
investigations.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.000
Let me leave this here.
I won't draw in anything yet.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:17.000
You will figure out what it
looks like yourselves under

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:21.000
certain conditions.
What I will do next is apply

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.000
some voltages on a MOSFET and
observe the current versus vDS

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:31.000
behavior and plot that on a
scope and take a look at it.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
What I am going to do --

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:45.000
-- is figure out what iDS looks
like for --

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:57.000
Remember iG into the gate for
6.002 is always going to be

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000
zero.
In much more detailed analyses

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
of the MOSFET,
in future courses you may see

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:07.000
slightly more complex behavior.
But as far as we are concerned

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000
it is an open circuit looking
into the gate.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:13.000
So I am going to apply a vGS
across the MOSFET,

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000
apply a vDS across the MOSFET
and plot iDS versus vDS.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000
First let me show you what you
already know.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000
What you already know --

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000
This is vDS.
I will just keep doing as much

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000
as I can of what you already
know.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.000
And then when I do some new
stuff I will tell you

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000
explicitly.
You've seen this before.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:49.000
The MOSFET behaves like an open
circuit when vGS less than VT.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:53.000
That is when vG is less than a
threshold voltage VT,

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:59.000
I have zero current flowing
through the MOSFET.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:03.000
And when vGS was greater than
VT then the S model of the

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:07.000
MOSFET the switch model simply
said that look,

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.000
we can model the D2S as a short
circuit.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.000
You saw this in your labs and
you saw that it was a very,

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:19.000
very small resistance between
the drain and the source and it

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.000
kind of looked like a short
circuit.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.000
But then we said well,
that's not quite it.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:32.000
There is some resistance.
And so we said a slightly more

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:38.000
accurate model would have this
line droop a little bit to imply

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:44.000
that there was some resistance
R_on between the drain and the

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:49.000
source, so vDS iDS.
So this was when vGS less than

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.000
VT and vGS greater than or equal
to VT.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:58.000
I have some resistance.
And that showed me a straight

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:05.000
line kind of like behavior.
And I showed you that behavior.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:13.000
So far absolutely nothing new.
Now what I have plotted there

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:19.000
for you is that behavior.
Up here notice that this is the

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:27.000
vDS axis, this is the iDS axis.
I am plotting iDS versus vDS.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:32.000
And when vGS --
The gate voltage is more than a

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:36.000
threshold, notice that I see
what looks like something more

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:40.000
or less like a straight line.
And this is a straight line

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.000
with some slope,
more or less a straight line

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:47.000
implying resistive behavior.
And we also had some fun and

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.000
games here.
We said hey,

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.000
what if I turn vGS off?
Boom.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:55.000
That would be my iDS of zero
implying that the MOSFET behaved

00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:01.000
like an open circuit between the
drain and the source.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:05.000
I applied a positive vGS more
than VT and it began to look

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.000
like a resistor.
Open circuit,

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000
resistor, open circuit,
resistor, OK?

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:15.000
Up until now nothing new.
So you shouldn't have learned

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:19.000
anything at all that is new
until now in today's lecture.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.000
Now watch.
What I am going to do is,

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:27.000
as I said, I kind of lied all
this time and I just showed you

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:32.000
this behavior.
And what I have been doing all

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.000
along is very carefully using a
very small value of vDS.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.000
Notice it's a small values of
vDS.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:43.000
I haven't told you what it
looks like as vDS increases.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.000
Well, let's go try it out.
We have a scope here.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:50.000
We have the MOSFET here.
Now, I am not sure what is

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:54.000
going to happen now.
You may see smoke or have an

00:19:54.000 --> 00:20:00.000
explosion, who knows what?
But look up there for a second.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:08.000
I am just going to increase vDS
and you can figure out what

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:14.000
happens for yourselves.
I increase vDS.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:20.000
Whoa, what a liar.
Agarwal is a liar.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:25.000
I have been kind of tricking
you.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:33.000
I have been putting --
Covering up all this part here

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:39.000
and showing you just this region
of the curve for small values of

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:43.000
vDS.
But as I increase vDS this is

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:49.000
nothing that looks even close to
that of resistive behavior.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:54.000
So what's happening here?
What's happening is that as I

00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:01.000
increase my vDS the iDS curve
tails off and saturates at some

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:06.000
value of current.
Notice it saturates at some

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:10.000
value of current.
And so I am going to look at

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:15.000
this region of behavior.
Notice that what we have looked

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:19.000
at so far was the behavior for
small vDS.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:24.000
It kind of looks resistive.
But when I pump up the vDS,

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:29.000
really whack this node really
hard with a much larger vDS the

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:33.000
guy says, oh,
I give up.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:38.000
And the current saturates out
and flattens out and holds the

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:43.000
value steady at some value.
So what's that behavior look

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.000
like?
What is my horizontal line

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:49.000
above the X axis in terms of V I
elements?

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:53.000
What is that behavior like?
Current source,

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:57.000
exactly.
So this is current source like

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:02.000
behavior.
And so let me start by drawing

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:08.000
you a little model and
explaining it in more detail.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:14.000
What happens is that under
certain conditions,

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:19.000
and the conditions are the
following, when vDS,

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:26.000
that is my drain to source
voltage is greater than or equal

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:32.000
to vGS minus VT.
When my drain voltage goes

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:36.000
above vGS minus VT,
so if vGS is 3 volts and if VT

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:39.000
is 1 volt, then if vDS goes
above 2 volts,

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:45.000
if I am hammering the drain of
the MOSFET with a higher voltage

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:50.000
then this guy says I give up,
can't show you nice restive

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:54.000
behavior, and the current
saturates out and it doesn't

00:22:54.000 --> 00:23:00.000
allow you draw any more current
than a maximum value.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.000
And that's the current source
behavior.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.000
This one behaves like a current
source.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:09.000
And the current iDS is given by
the following expression.

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:29.000
The current is given by iDS is
equal to a constant K divide by

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:35.000
two times (vGS-VT) all squared.
Kind of reminiscent of the

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:38.000
carefully chosen dependent
source example,

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:44.000
just that this one here is VT.
This model, which applies when

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:48.000
vGS is greater than VT,
the MOSFET has to be on and the

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:54.000
drain to source voltage in the
MOSFET must be larger than some

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:59.000
value, and that value is vGS
minus VT then this guy begins to

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:06.000
behave like a current source.
This model of the MOSFET is

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:11.000
called the "switch current
source model".

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:21.000
So in the region of the MOSFET
characteristics where vGS is

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:25.000
greater than VT and the drain to
source voltage is larger than

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.000
vGS minus VT,
the MOSFET behaved like a

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:32.000
current source between its drain
and source terminals.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.000
And in that part we model the
MOSFET as a current source.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:40.000
And so not surprisingly that
part of the model is called the

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:43.000
SCS model in contrast with the
SR model where we had a

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.000
resistor.
Again, remember,

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:48.000
this is not meant to be
conflicting.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:51.000
It is not like gee,
how can the MOSFET look like a

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:55.000
resistor, and then suddenly what
happens it becomes a current

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:58.000
source.
Well, the two regions are

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:03.000
different.
It is not that it is behaving

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:08.000
as a current source for the same
parameters, no.

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:14.000
When vDS is less than this
right-hand side it does behave

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:18.000
resistive.
The SR model applies.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:24.000
But increase vDS beyond a
point, the current saturates and

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:30.000
the SCS applies like so.
So let's draw.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:36.000
The SCS behavior can be drawn
here vDS and iDS.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:43.000
As I mentioned to you,
for small values of vDS,

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:50.000
let's say I pick some value of
vGS, let's say vGS3,

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:56.000
some value vGS,
it is going to look like a

00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:05.000
resistor until vDS becomes equal
to vGS3 minus VT.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:12.000
And after that it saturates out
and begins to look like a

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:17.000
current source.
And this point is where vDS

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:25.000
becomes equal to vGS minus VT.
And this way is when this equal

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:32.000
sign becomes a greater than
sign, vDS becomes larger then I

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:38.000
move into this part of the
curve.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:44.000
Similarly, for various other
values of vGS it will look like

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.000
this --

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.000
-- and so on.
And it behaved like an open

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:57.000
circuit as before when vGS less
than VT.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:01.000
When vGS less than VT it is
still behaving like an open

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:05.000
circuit.
And so as I increase my vGS,

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:10.000
provided I keep my vDS greater
than vGS minus VT,

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:13.000
I get current source like
behavior.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:17.000
And notice that this is
increasing vGS.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:22.000
I have purposely drawn these
curves at greater distances from

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:28.000
each other to imply that it is a
nonlinear relationship in that

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:33.000
if I increase vGS by some
amount, the increase in vDS is

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:41.000
related to the square of vGS.
It is vGS minus VT all squared.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:46.000
So I get a family of curves of
that look like this.

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:52.000
And this is in the region of
operation where vDS equals vGS

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:56.000
minus VT.
And this applies in this regime

00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:01.000
where vDS less than vGS minus
VT.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:06.000
This region of operation is
called, as you might expect,

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:09.000
the "saturation region".

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:19.000
We say the MOSFET has been
hammered, the MOSFET has been

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:23.000
walloped, the MOSFET is in
saturation.

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:27.000
So the MOSFET is in saturation.
This region,

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:32.000
corresponding to this,
is called the triode region.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:40.000
This is really very simple.
All we are doing is saying that

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:43.000
when vDS is increased beyond a
certain limit,

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:47.000
given my vGS minus VT,
the MOSFET begins to behave

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:50.000
like a current source.
It cannot draw any more

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:52.000
current.
It limits the current to a

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:54.000
given value like a current
source.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:58.000
But on the left-hand side of
this it behaves in a resistive

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:01.000
manner.
So what I would like to do is

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:02.000
--

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:11.000
What I will do is,
we've plotted for you,

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:14.000
for the MOSFET,
all its characteristics in its

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:20.000
full glory for a whole bunch of
values of vGS and a whole bunch

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:23.000
of values of vDS.
And let me stare at those

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:27.000
curves with you for a few
seconds and walk you through

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:31.000
them.
So what do I have here?

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:35.000
One of these curves corresponds
to a given value of vGS.

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:39.000
This may be vGS equals 2 volts.
This is vDS,

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:43.000
the drain to source voltage,
and this is the current.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:48.000
So focus on this curve for now.
In the beginning I hid the

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:53.000
right-hand side behavior from
you and showed you just the

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:58.000
resistive behavior out here.
When I increase vDS to be much

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:02.000
larger the curve saturated and I
got the saturation region

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:08.000
operation of the MOSFET.
And notice as I increase my

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:13.000
value of vGS the saturation
current also increases according

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:19.000
to a square law behavior.
So these are the entire curves

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:22.000
of the MOSFET.
Finally the truth comes out.

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:27.000
And notice that when vDS is
less than vGS minus VT,

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:32.000
I have more or less resistive
behavior.

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:38.000
But when vDS is greater than
vGS minus VT I get current

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:43.000
source like behavior.
So one question you may ask is

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:47.000
when do I use one model or the
other?

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:54.000
When do I use the SR model and
when do I use the SCS model?

00:30:54.000 --> 00:31:00.000
If you want to do a real
detailed analysis then you can

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:07.000
use the SR model when vDS is
less than vGS minus VT.

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:12.000
And you would use this model
when vDS is greater than or

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:16.000
equal to vGS minus VT.
That is simple enough.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:21.000
In 6.002, to eliminate
confusion we constrain how we

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:26.000
look at things a little bit more
stringently.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:31.000
And what we do is that for our
entire digital analysis,

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:38.000
for the entire digital world we
focus on the SR model.

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:41.000
And I will tell you why in a
second.

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:46.000
So for all digital circuits,
invertors, look at power of

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:50.000
invertors, look at delay,
a bunch of other things,

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:54.000
we will be using the SR model
in 6.002.

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:57.000
And I will tell you why in a
second.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:02.000
And for analog --
That is for amplifier designs

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:06.000
and situations like that,
we will be operating the MOSFET

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:10.000
in a saturation region.
And I will talk about that in a

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:13.000
second.
What I am saying here is that

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:17.000
in 6.002, when we do analog
designs, we are going to

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:21.000
discipline ourselves to using
the MOSFET only in this region.

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:26.000
We are going to constrain
ourselves to play in only this

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:31.000
region of the playground where
vDS is quite large.

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.000
Why?
Because I am asking you to.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:37.000
I am saying let's play in that
part of the playground and keep

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:40.000
your vDS high.
And so the MOSFET is going to

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:45.000
be operating somewhere in here.
So we can apply just the SCS

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:49.000
model, just the current source
behavior in that region.

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:53.000
There is another important
reason, which I will get to in a

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:56.000
second.
And for digital designs we will

00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:01.000
simply use the SR model.
And it turns out that this is

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:06.000
realistic because in the digital
designs that you have you seen

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:10.000
and will be seeing in this
course, the pull down MOSFET is

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:13.000
on, or when these pull down
MOSFETs are on,

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:17.000
the output voltage is pulled
down close to ground.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:19.000
So vDS is very,
very small.

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:22.000
So it does make sense that this
model apply.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:27.000
And when we talk about
amplifiers, I am asking you to

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:31.000
follow this discipline.
I will tell you why in a

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.000
second.
I am saying analog designs

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:37.000
follow this discipline that I
call the saturation discipline.

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:41.000
It says simply operate the
MOSFET operating in saturation

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:44.000
as a current source.
We will look at an amplifier in

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:47.000
a second, and I will tell you
why.

00:33:54.000 --> 00:34:01.000
Now let's do a MOSFET
amplifier.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:06.000
Remember my amplifier had an
input port and an output port.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:12.000
And in general in our use we
are going to have a common

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:15.000
ground.
And we have a VS and a ground

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:19.000
here as well.
That is the power port of the

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:23.000
amplifier.
The input port and the output

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:25.000
port.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:39.000
And let me redraw the circuit
putting a MOSFET in place of the

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:44.000
current source,
RL, VS, vO, drain,

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:47.000
gate, source,
vI.

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:54.000
So my input is vI.
Again, the MOSFET output is vO.

00:34:54.000 --> 00:35:02.000
And I have a resistor RL.
Hey, we've seen that before.

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:05.000
It turns out this is not
surprising.

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:09.000
You've seen this before.
This was our primitive inverter

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:12.000
circuit.
So what's different here?

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:15.000
We showed you the circuit as an
inverter.

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:20.000
What's different here is that
when we look at MOSFET behavior

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:24.000
as a current source,
this behaves like an amplifier.

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:28.000
In other words,
when vDS is greater than some

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:33.000
value then this behaves like a
current source.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:35.000
When vDS is small,
in other words,

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:38.000
in the digital design when vDS
was small here,

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:43.000
because when the MOSFET was on
it pulled the voltage down to

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:46.000
ground, we could view this
behavior as a resistor.

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:50.000
And exactly the same thing,
it is an amplifier.

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:54.000
And with digital designs,
I was driving it with 5 volts

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:58.000
and 0 volts and that was it,
rail to rail.

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:01.000
As an amplifier,
what I am doing now is looking

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:05.000
at a small region of its
behavior when vDS is greater

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:08.000
than vGS minus VT.
What I am saying is that for

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:12.000
amplification let's follow the
saturation discipline.

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:16.000
And the reason is that when
this behaves like a current

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:20.000
source, what I have shown you is
that if this behaves like a

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:25.000
current source I have shown you
that this expression up here

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:30.000
gives you amplification.
In last lecture we plotted a

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:34.000
bunch of values for vO versus
vI, and we saw that we were

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:37.000
getting amplification.
For a small change in vI,

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:41.000
I was getting a larger change
in vO, and that was when I had

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:44.000
the equation for a current
source in there.

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:49.000
And so we know for a fact that
if I can operate this as a

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:52.000
current source,
with a reasonable choice of

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:56.000
values here, I am going to be
able to get amplification.

00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:00.000
What I haven't told you is if
this is operated in the linear

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:05.000
region, in fact,
you do not get amplification.

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:09.000
I won't cover that,
but you can check that out in

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:13.000
your course notes as a
discussion or you can try it out

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:17.000
for yourself.
Replace this with the SR model

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:22.000
for small vDS and you can show
yourselves that you don't get

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:25.000
any amplification.
In order to get the

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:30.000
amplification we are telling
ourselves let's focus on this

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:36.000
part of the playground where vDS
is greater than or equal to vGS

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:40.000
minus VT.
And for vGS greater than or

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:44.000
equal to VT.
So when vGS is greater than VT

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:48.000
the MOSFET is on.
Further, when vDS is large,

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:53.000
larger than vGS minus VT this
behaves like a current source.

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:58.000
So we have now created a small
playground for ourselves where

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:05.000
we can build lots of fun little
amplifiers and other circuits.

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:09.000
And provided our circuits
follow the saturation discipline

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:13.000
where for the MOSFET or MOSFETs
in the circuit these expressions

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:17.000
are true then the MOSFETs are
going to be in saturation,

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:21.000
the current source model
applies, and I will be indeed

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:25.000
getting saturation.
In future courses you may

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:29.000
actually see the MOSFET used in
other regimes of operation for a

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:34.000
variety of reasons.
But in 6.002 when we talk about

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:38.000
amplifiers and so on we will be
adopting the saturation

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:41.000
discipline.
And your homework problems and

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:45.000
so on will state that.
Assume that the MOSFETs are in

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:48.000
saturation.
What that means is that you can

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:52.000
begin to model them as a current
source and simply analyze their

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:55.000
behavior accordingly.
One minor nit.

00:38:55.000 --> 00:39:00.000
Note that vDS for the MOSFET is
the same as vO.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:04.000
And vGS for the MOSFET is the
same as vI.

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:10.000
So if you see me jumping back
and forth using vOs and vIs or

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:15.000
vDSs and vGSs they are the same
thing in this circuit.

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:21.000
If you are dealing with
circuits with many MOSFETs then

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:28.000
you will have vDS1s and vGS1s
and so on and so forth.

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:34.000
But for this simple circuit,
vO and vDS are the same,

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:41.000
vI and vGS are the same.
So we could go ahead and

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:47.000
analyze that circuit.
What I do to analyze the

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:54.000
circuit, I am telling you this.
I am telling you that the

00:39:54.000 --> 00:40:00.000
MOSFET is behaving in
saturation.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:03.000
I am telling you this.
We have disciplined ourselves

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:07.000
to say that in that circuit the
MOSFET is in saturation.

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:11.000
As soon as we tell you that we
can then go ahead and analyze

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:13.000
that circuit.
And to analyze that circuit

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:17.000
what you will do is simply
replace the MOSFET with its

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:20.000
equivalent model,
and that looks like this.

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:23.000
Since you have been told that
it is in saturation,

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:28.000
we can replace the MOSFET with
its current source model.

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:45.000
And the current iDS for the
MOSFET is given by K/2(vI-VT)^2.

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:54.000
And it is always good to write
the constraints under which you

00:40:54.000 --> 00:41:02.000
are implicitly working close by.
So the constraints are one,

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:09.000
vGS is greater than or equal to
VT, vDS is greater than or equal

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:14.000
to vGS minus VT.
These constraints immediately

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:20.000
follow from a statement of the
type we are operating under the

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:26.000
saturation discipline or the
MOSFET is in saturation.

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:32.000
Let me just mark this equation
as A, and we will refer to it

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:34.000
again.

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:49.000
So with this new little circuit
with the MOSFET working as a

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:53.000
current source,
let's go ahead and analyze our

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:56.000
amplifier.
Notice that to analyze the

00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:01.000
circuit I have a current source.
It's a dependent current source

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:07.000
where the current depends on the
square of the input.

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:12.000
So I want to go and analyze it.
This is a nonlinear circuit.

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:17.000
So I can apply any one of the
methods that we talked about

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:20.000
last week for nonlinear
circuits.

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:26.000
To analyze it I will go ahead
and use the analytical method.

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:31.000
And my goal will be to obtain
vO versus vI.

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:33.000
Again, remember where are we
here?

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:37.000
The MOSFET circuit operating in
saturation so I can replace this

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:40.000
with a current source.
It is nonlinear.

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:44.000
And so I can apply one of the
two methods, the analytical

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:49.000
method or the graphical method.
Let's do both and start with

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:52.000
the analytical method.
The analytical method simply

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:55.000
says go forth,
apply the node method and

00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:56.000
solve.
Simple stuff.

00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:00.000
Let's go ahead and do that.
Node method.

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:04.000
I have a single node here that
is of interest.

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:07.000
I know the voltage vI at this
node.

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:09.000
I know the voltage VS at this
node.

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:12.000
So the only unknown is here at
vO.

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:17.000
So I will go ahead and do that.
Let me go ahead and equate the

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:19.000
currents into the node to be
zero.

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:23.000
So the currents out of the node
here are iDS.

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:27.000
And that was equal the current
into that same node.

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:32.000
So iDS must equal VS minus vO
divided by RL.

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:39.000
iDS=VS-vO/RL.
For later reference,

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:46.000
let me call that B.
Simplifying,

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:55.000
what I can do is,
we know that iDS is given by

00:43:55.000 --> 00:44:03.000
K/2(vI-VT)^2.
So I replace iDS with this

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:08.000
expression and I multiply that
by RL.

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:15.000
So I get K/2(vI-VT)RL.
So iDS gets multiplied by RL

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:22.000
and I get vO on this side and VS
remains out here.

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:30.000
All I have done is multiplied
both sides by RL.

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:33.000
So it is RL iDS,
taken RL iDS to this side,

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:37.000
that is here,
I get the minus sign,

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:40.000
and VS stays here,
vO comes here.

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:45.000
So that is my final expression.
Remember this is true under

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:50.000
certain conditions.
I will keep hammering that home

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:55.000
because some of the most common
errors made by people is in

00:44:55.000 --> 00:45:02.000
forgetting the constraints under
which this was obtained.

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:08.000
And the constraint under which
this was obtained is the

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:14.000
saturation discipline.
And that was true when vGS for

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:21.000
a MOSFET was greater than or
equal to VT and vDS for a MOSFET

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:26.000
was greater than or equal to vGS
minus VT.

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:33.000
I also know that for vGS less
than VT, vO=VS.

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:38.000
So when vGS is less than VT
then this one turns off.

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:44.000
That's why it is the SCS model,
switch current source model.

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:50.000
When vGS is less than zero it
turns off and VS directly

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:54.000
appears at vO.
I would like to stare at this

00:45:54.000 --> 00:46:00.000
constraint with you for a
second, vDS greater than or

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:08.000
equal to vGS minus VT here.
And vDS is simply vO.

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:17.000
I want to rewrite this
constraint in terms of iDS.

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:26.000
It will come in handy.
So iDS is K/2(vI-VT)^2.

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:34.000
This is vI-VT.
So vI-VT is simply square root

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:39.000
of 2iDS/K.
In other words,

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:45.000
I can write iDS less than or
equal to K/2vO^2.

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:53.000
So this constraint expressed in
terms of iDS is simply iDS less

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:57.000
than or equal to K/2vO^2.

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:10.000
So all I've done here is
analyzed this nonlinear circuit.

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:15.000
I can also analyze it using the
graphical method.

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:20.000
And in order to do that,
for my nonlinear circuit,

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:24.000
in order to do that,
all I have to do is plot.

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:29.000
Let's have iDS here and vDS
here.

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:36.000
And as we did with a nonlinear
expo dweeb, what I do is I plot

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:41.000
the device characteristics iDS
versus vDS.

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:48.000
The device characteristics
under saturation look like this,

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:53.000
so vGS increasing.
iDS versus vDS has a bunch of

00:47:53.000 --> 00:48:02.000
curves that look like current
sources of increasing values.

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:06.000
That simply reflects equation
A.

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:15.000
And then I superimpose on top
of that the expression that

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:22.000
comes up due to equation B which
is iDS equals,

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:32.000
let me write that down here,
iDS equals VS/RL - vO/RL.

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:35.000
That's B.
And let me plot that.

00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:43.000
That is a straight line
relationship between iDS and vO.

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:47.000
And so when vO is zero iDS is
VS/RL.

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:52.000
And when iDS is zero vO equals
VS.

00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:56.000
Remember, vO and vDS are the
same.

00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:03.000
So this is what I get.
This is the straight line

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:07.000
corresponding to equation B
here.

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:17.000
And, as before,
we just find the point where

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:21.000
the two intersect.
Let's say I am given some value

00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:25.000
of vGS.
And let's say I am given some

00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:29.000
known value of vDS.
So for that I can go ahead and

00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:36.000
find out the corresponding value
of iDS from this graph.

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:40.000
Just as I told you when we did
the expo dweeb stuff,

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:43.000
this line here is called a load
line.

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:47.000
You will be seeing that again
and again and again where we

00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:52.000
have the equation corresponding
to the one shown here,

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:57.000
the equation written for the
output loop superimposed on the

00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:02.000
device characteristics.
That's called a load line.

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:06.000
So I can get this point
corresponding to the operating

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:11.000
point of the MOSFET for this
iDS, vDS and vGS by using the

00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:14.000
graphical method.
In the next lecture we are

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:18.000
going to look at,
given a device of this sort,

00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:23.000
how do we figure out the
boundaries of valid operation so

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:26.000
that the MOSFET stays in
saturation?

[SQUEAKING]

00:00:01.984 --> 00:00:04.464
[RUSTLING]

00:00:04.464 --> 00:00:07.440
[CLICKING]

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:20.510
PROFESSOR: Take a moment
to look around you.

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:24.170
Look at the person
on your right.

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:26.060
Now look at the
person on your left.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:35.100
Turn around and look behind
you and in front of you.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.220
If you have a question
on mathematics,

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.030
or you want to know something
about the potential new

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.720
elements in the
cosmic dust of space,

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.580
or perhaps you want
to know something

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.280
about the architecture of
the most beautiful bridge

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.780
in the world, the Millau
Bridge in southwestern France,

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.810
chances are there is
a good possibility

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.420
that someone in
this class may be

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.130
able to answer your question.

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:08.310
There are 11 different
majors in this small class.

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.190
This presents a great
opportunity for you

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:18.190
to actually mingle with these
majors and broaden your ideas.

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:20.340
Welcome to 5.310.

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:26.480
5.310 is a non-major sequence
in the chemistry department.

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:31.160
In chemistry, in MIT
lingo actually, this

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:36.230
is a 2-8-2 course.

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:37.670
12 credits.

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:44.120
In MIT policies,
one credit unit is

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:50.045
14 hours of work per semester.

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.590
So if we look at
this, we've actually

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:06.990
got 28 hours of lecture,
112 hours of lab,

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:15.815
and 28 hours of outside work
for a total of 168 hours.

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:26.640
But you really only have--

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.410
you're really only
going to be in lecture

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.720
for 17 of those hours.

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.860
And there are five labs.

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.870
Each lab is four days.

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.400
That's 20 days times
4 hours is 80 hours.

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.240
One of the labs is five days
so that's 84 hours of lab.

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:58.850
This outside work is on the low
side so I'm going to fix it.

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:00.260
I'm going to
increase that to 50.

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.380
Does that make you feel good?

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:10.250
We're moving some
hours around here.

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.220
And there's one more thing.

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:21.410
17 hours of lecture but
three of the labs on day four

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:24.140
you get out right
after the quiz.

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.040
You can finish the
experiment in three days.

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:26.540
I know.

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.330
You're all excited
about that, right?

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:34.040
So we're really only talking
74 hours in lab here.

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.450
So I'm going to
increase this to 60.

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:46.920
So we end up with 151 hours.

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:57.830
If you subtract those, you
have a surplus of 17 hours.

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:01.880
So I just want you to see this
so that you feel good about it

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:03.230
and you know you're not--

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:05.300
if you look at this
and do the calculation,

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:09.410
you're going to be spending
between 10 and 11 hours a week

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:11.660
in this course.

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:16.370
And on the long side, if
you use these surplus hours,

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.720
you'll be at the
12 credit units.

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.850
Now take a look at this
slide for a moment.

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:28.880
If you look at the slide,
you can see that 5.310 ties

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.533
in to 5.35.

00:04:30.533 --> 00:04:36.680
5.35, six, seven, and eight
are the URIECA modules,

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:41.450
Undergraduate Research
Inspired Experimental Chemistry

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:43.820
Alternatives.

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:45.360
I got it all out.

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.860
OK.

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:46.640
Good.

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:49.880
So we've got 12 labs here.

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:55.850
Each lab is
approximately four units.

00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:01.310
And what happens is 5.310
ties into those labs.

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:04.070
Those are the labs that
the chem majors take.

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:06.920
So what that means is
if you're a freshman,

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:09.770
if you're a sophomore
or a junior,

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:13.130
and you suddenly decide that
you like chemistry and you want

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:17.640
to change your major, or
you want to double major,

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:23.070
I'll give you full credit
for 5.35 after taking 5.310.

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:26.460
So you'll eliminate
three of those modules

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:29.572
from your program.

00:05:29.572 --> 00:05:30.280
It's a good deal.

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:38.170
Now let's talk a little
bit about the course.

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:43.030
So is this course
useful to my future?

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:47.230
It is an introductory
laboratory chemistry course.

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:49.960
But you will learn
basic skills that you'll

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:52.960
be able to carry away with you
for the rest of your tenure

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:56.610
at MIT and beyond MIT.

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:58.420
What you're going to
learn in this course--

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:02.140
you'll learn about
small scale synthesis.

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:06.260
You'll learn about inert
atmosphere techniques,

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:10.540
thin layer chromatography
and column chromatography.

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:13.900
You'll do an atmospheric
distillation and a vacuum

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:16.750
distillation.

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:20.140
You'll also operate a
variety of instruments.

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:22.960
And these are the most
modern instruments

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:27.160
that you're going to
find in pharma companies,

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:31.750
in chemical companies, and
industry when you go out.

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:36.580
You'll be operating things like
polarimeters, refractometers,

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:38.920
density meters.

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:43.330
You'll operate a tabletop
nuclear magnetic resonance

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:48.040
spectrometer, 60
megahertz just for you.

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:53.950
You'll operate a robotic
GC, an IR spectrometer,

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:59.260
UV spectrometer, and
a mass spectrometer.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:03.190
You'll also get to put
your samples in and watch

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:07.270
an inductively coupled plasma
mass spectrometer running.

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:10.250
There's only two at MIT.

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:14.060
And you also will go to
the X-ray lab here at MIT.

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:17.000
And you'll see the most
modern X-ray diffraction

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.660
machine from Germany
running some of your samples

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:23.300
from the essential oils lab.

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:27.890
In one part of the lab,
you'll go on a field trip

00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:30.460
to the Charles River.

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:32.500
Can take your lunch.

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:34.840
You're going to bring
back water samples.

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:38.920
You'll be testing those water
samples for dissolved oxygen

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:41.440
and phosphate levels.

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:43.990
Above all these
things, you're going

00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:47.080
to learn organizational
skills that you'll

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:51.850
have with you for the rest of
your career wherever you go.

00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:59.090
Can you give me any hot tips?

00:07:59.090 --> 00:08:01.190
Students always
ask for a hot tip.

00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:06.200
And I can tell you one thing
that actually works for me.

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:13.250
And that is sometimes we all
get frustrated and discouraged.

00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:17.540
And when that happens, I
usually find a quiet place

00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:19.640
and I talk to my brain.

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:22.460
And I tell my brain
everything is OK.

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:24.650
Everything is going to be fine.

00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:27.720
And time and time again,
this works for me.

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:30.530
I can get myself out of it.

00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:34.640
And if you read Oliver
Sachs, in one of his books,

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:40.120
he says that if you
can imagine things,

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:43.490
they actually can
turn into reality.

00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:46.750
So are there any brain and
cognitive science folks?

00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:47.500
Oh good.

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:48.130
Look at this.

00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:49.660
I've got four of them.

00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:56.020
Can any of you offer any
comments on how this helps me?

00:08:56.020 --> 00:08:57.220
Is there something there?

00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:02.520
Anyone?

00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:06.425
No takers.

00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:11.800
Anyone else?

00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:20.930
So I guess the
thinking about, you

00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:24.860
must become happier and
clear your thoughts out.

00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:27.740
And if you become happier
and clear your thoughts,

00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:29.690
you become smarter too.

00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:31.670
Right?

00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:35.810
And I actually
brought a brain that I

00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:39.620
keep in my refrigerator,
a beautiful brain.

00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:43.760
And I'm just going to set it
here so that you can admire it.

00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:47.960
So the brain is very important.

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:57.140
Some of you in this course
are very, very smart.

00:09:57.140 --> 00:09:58.640
You're all very
smart because you

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:01.460
got into MIT or at
the top of your class.

00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:02.670
You're valedictorians.

00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:09.980
I recall several years
ago I had a freshman

00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:12.510
advisee who came to me.

00:10:12.510 --> 00:10:16.740
And she actually tested
out of every subject.

00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:19.020
She sat down and I
could not find one

00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:22.290
subject to put this student in.

00:10:22.290 --> 00:10:24.520
So I was kind of beside myself.

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:26.730
I went out of my
office and I bumped

00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:28.470
into the head of the
physics department

00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:32.043
walking down the hall and
said, I've got this advisee

00:10:32.043 --> 00:10:33.210
and I don't know what to do.

00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:35.430
Did you ever have one like this?

00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:38.830
He said once every 10 years.

00:10:38.830 --> 00:10:41.790
So I went back and I put her
into all the most advanced

00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:45.180
classes, some with
graduate students.

00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:48.870
And then I ask her
how she managed

00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:53.750
to do all this because she came
from an island in the Pacific.

00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:58.950
And she said to me
OCW, OpenCourseWare.

00:10:58.950 --> 00:11:02.670
I watched the lectures
that MIT puts out

00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:05.580
and I learned it all myself.

00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:09.960
But there are geniuses
sprinkled throughout MIT.

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:13.110
And there are probably
geniuses in this class.

00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:15.990
Should you still take 5.310?

00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:20.460
Yes, because geniuses
need practical skills.

00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:27.540
And in 5.310 can help you
to bind those basic skills

00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:32.240
and make your genius
become reality.

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:34.400
Now there are a couple
other key things

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:38.000
to help you succeed
in this course.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.750
One, if you feel
like you need help

00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:47.390
and you don't know what to do,
you're lost, come to see us.

00:11:47.390 --> 00:11:50.680
And we'll get you back on track.

00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:52.920
The second thing,
which is important,

00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:58.170
is you need to be able
to accept your mistakes.

00:11:58.170 --> 00:12:02.190
If you make a mistake,
don't start crying and say

00:12:02.190 --> 00:12:03.090
it's all over.

00:12:03.090 --> 00:12:05.780
I blew this lab.

00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:08.710
I just messed everything up.

00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:10.110
I'm done for here.

00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:11.880
I don't know what to do.

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:14.890
Just accept the mistake
and ask yourself,

00:12:14.890 --> 00:12:20.460
what can I get out of
this mistake that I made.

00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:25.270
And when you do that, you
really can help yourself

00:12:25.270 --> 00:12:27.560
for the long term.

00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:31.640
I mean it's not anything
embarrassing if a student works

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:34.340
for three days and
then, by accident,

00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:36.290
they drop their product.

00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:37.800
It happens.

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:39.110
So don't feel bad about it.

00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:42.540
Just come to us and
we'll work something out.

00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:45.470
But don't get
stressed out over it.

00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:47.300
The last thing that
could really help you

00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:51.875
here is, in this class,
it's all about lab reports.

00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:56.780
So you've got to write
these four lab reports

00:12:56.780 --> 00:12:59.330
and give an oral
report at the end.

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:02.870
My advice to you is don't
wait until the last day

00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:09.050
of the last weekend when these
reports are due to actually try

00:13:09.050 --> 00:13:11.210
to write this report out.

00:13:11.210 --> 00:13:13.730
Start early.

00:13:13.730 --> 00:13:16.250
When you're in the
lab, a four hour

00:13:16.250 --> 00:13:19.370
lab, and a lot of
those labs you'll

00:13:19.370 --> 00:13:22.730
get done at four so
you'll have an hour.

00:13:22.730 --> 00:13:26.360
We have beautiful write up
areas in the new undergraduate

00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:27.290
chemistry lab.

00:13:27.290 --> 00:13:28.790
You can sit there.

00:13:28.790 --> 00:13:31.400
And that's the point where
you can actually write out

00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:37.250
a paragraph about what you did
that day, what you actually

00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:40.160
did, what you saw,
and what you found.

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:44.330
And that's your procedure
and observations

00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:46.130
for your lab report.

00:13:46.130 --> 00:13:49.610
And while it's fresh in
your mind, you do it.

00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:52.430
And the procedure and
observations typically

00:13:52.430 --> 00:13:55.610
is about a page and a half,
no more than two pages,

00:13:55.610 --> 00:13:57.230
of your lab report.

00:13:57.230 --> 00:14:01.300
You could also work on the
background of the report

00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:04.425
because you're talking
about why you're

00:14:04.425 --> 00:14:06.550
doing this experiment, what
you're going to get out

00:14:06.550 --> 00:14:12.550
of it, something about the
history of the experiment, what

00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:13.640
was done before.

00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:16.870
So you can work on these
sections along the way

00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:21.130
rather than wait until the very
end and do a marathon session,

00:14:21.130 --> 00:14:24.980
try to trying to get
the lab report done.

00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:29.390
So with those things, I'd
like to talk a little bit

00:14:29.390 --> 00:14:32.220
about the course.

00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:38.730
And I'm going to cover
seven broad areas.

00:14:38.730 --> 00:14:44.660
One is academic integrity.

00:14:52.240 --> 00:15:01.230
The second thing
is the lab policies

00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:04.470
and then, most
importantly, grading,

00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:05.970
how this course will be graded.

00:15:12.410 --> 00:15:14.890
And then we'll look a
little bit at safety,

00:15:14.890 --> 00:15:17.320
because you do have a safety
lecture you're going to.

00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:27.720
And we'll look a little bit
at the lab notebooks that

00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:28.935
are required for the course.

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:41.240
And we'll talk a little
bit about waste management.

00:15:52.690 --> 00:15:57.400
And finally, we'll
spend a little bit

00:15:57.400 --> 00:16:04.780
of time talking about
calibration of instruments.

00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:19.910
So let's start with
academic honesty.

00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:25.420
MIT has one of the
best integrity programs

00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:28.120
of any school that I know.

00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:30.520
They have a website
devoted to it.

00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:34.930
They also have printed
material that you can pick up

00:16:34.930 --> 00:16:37.460
and you can read through it.

00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:40.390
And I think probably
to summarize it

00:16:40.390 --> 00:16:47.170
in just one sentence, you don't
want to present as your work

00:16:47.170 --> 00:16:51.970
the efforts and product
of another person.

00:16:51.970 --> 00:16:55.030
And the penalties
can be quite severe.

00:16:55.030 --> 00:16:58.450
You could actually
fail the assignment.

00:16:58.450 --> 00:17:01.280
Could fail the course.

00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:03.610
You could be suspended
from the Institute.

00:17:03.610 --> 00:17:06.050
You could even
forfeit your degree.

00:17:06.050 --> 00:17:08.319
So it's pretty serious business.

00:17:08.319 --> 00:17:18.880
In 5.310, I think there are two
areas that you need to actually

00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:19.720
look at.

00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:23.930
One of them is there are a
lot of lab reports out there.

00:17:23.930 --> 00:17:25.359
They're in the dorms.

00:17:25.359 --> 00:17:27.940
And they're in the
sororities and fraternities.

00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:30.790
And they call them bibles.

00:17:30.790 --> 00:17:38.050
So you don't want to actually
go out and take pieces out

00:17:38.050 --> 00:17:43.960
of those and put them
in your own reports.

00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:48.430
The reason for that is
it's not right to do that.

00:17:48.430 --> 00:17:50.680
And the second
reason is we could

00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:56.500
have an electronic copy of
one of those reports on file.

00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:58.750
That would not be good.

00:17:58.750 --> 00:18:02.770
The other thing is I guess
the innocent thing is

00:18:02.770 --> 00:18:04.750
when students sit down
together and they're

00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:05.920
talking about the lab.

00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:08.740
You might talk with
your lab partner.

00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:12.550
You can talk and you're
writing things down.

00:18:12.550 --> 00:18:14.890
But what you don't want
to end up happening

00:18:14.890 --> 00:18:18.010
is you don't want to have the
same sentences in both lab

00:18:18.010 --> 00:18:19.490
reports.

00:18:19.490 --> 00:18:22.180
So you've got to put
things in your own words

00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:24.340
even when you talk
with each other

00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:27.370
and you're writing
your reports up.

00:18:27.370 --> 00:18:31.338
That's pretty much all I have
to say about academic integrity.

00:18:35.010 --> 00:18:39.680
S the undergraduate
lab policies--

00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:43.580
you're actually picking to
work on either Monday/Wednesday

00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:45.970
or Tuesday/Thursday.

00:18:45.970 --> 00:18:48.940
And depending on the safety
lecture that you elected,

00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:52.060
some of you went yesterday
to the safety lecture

00:18:52.060 --> 00:18:56.830
and you enrolled in the
Monday/Wednesday section.

00:18:56.830 --> 00:19:02.500
Today the safety lecture is at 1
o'clock right after this class.

00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:07.390
And Tuesday/Thursday people
will go there, attend the safety

00:19:07.390 --> 00:19:09.400
lecture, and then
you'll go up to lab

00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:12.580
to check in your lockers.

00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:16.330
If there are any
Tuesday/Thursday people who

00:19:16.330 --> 00:19:19.390
would like to switch
to Monday/Wednesday,

00:19:19.390 --> 00:19:22.400
Monday/Wednesday will
have fewer students.

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:27.070
So there'll be much better
TA interaction with you.

00:19:27.070 --> 00:19:30.880
So if you can, just
let Sarah know.

00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:35.350
She'll be down
front at 1 o'clock

00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:37.720
registering you
for your lockers.

00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:39.520
And if you'd like to
do Monday/Wednesday,

00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:40.990
you can check in today.

00:19:40.990 --> 00:19:45.100
We'll just give you a
Monday/Wednesday locker.

00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:49.120
The lab itself opens
at 1 o'clock every day.

00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:54.820
And the TAs will give a
pre-lab lecture at 1:05.

00:19:54.820 --> 00:19:57.370
It's about a 20 minute lecture.

00:19:57.370 --> 00:19:59.350
It's going to cover
exactly what you're

00:19:59.350 --> 00:20:02.500
doing in that four hour period.

00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:07.510
And they will also demonstrate
some of the glassware, maybe

00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:09.970
the pipettes, and
anything you're

00:20:09.970 --> 00:20:11.800
going to be using in that lab.

00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:14.170
And they'll also show
you the instruments

00:20:14.170 --> 00:20:16.580
that you might be
running that day.

00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:19.190
So it's pretty important,
the pre-lab lecture.

00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:23.200
And it will also firm up
what you heard in the lecture

00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:26.620
and possibly didn't
understand something,

00:20:26.620 --> 00:20:31.480
your TAs can really
help in that respect.

00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:37.150
On the fourth lab day of each
experiment, there's a quiz.

00:20:37.150 --> 00:20:38.710
And that will cover--

00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:41.940
you've already done the
three days of the experiment

00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:44.860
so you should be in pretty
good shape for the quiz.

00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:49.670
You should understand what
you're doing and know.

00:20:49.670 --> 00:20:52.840
You shouldn't have
any problem with that.

00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:58.690
The laboratory, we try to
clean up about quarter to 5:00.

00:20:58.690 --> 00:21:03.790
I can't recall in 5.310 any
time where students have to stay

00:21:03.790 --> 00:21:05.410
after 5 o'clock.

00:21:05.410 --> 00:21:07.570
That's a good thing because
you want to go home.

00:21:07.570 --> 00:21:09.520
Some of you have sport practice.

00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:11.870
And we understand that.

00:21:11.870 --> 00:21:17.290
And the last thing is we've
indicated some select Fridays

00:21:17.290 --> 00:21:19.270
that are make-up labs.

00:21:19.270 --> 00:21:24.010
And there will be one Friday
at the end of each four day lab

00:21:24.010 --> 00:21:25.100
period.

00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:28.120
So if for some reason
you've missed something

00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:32.200
because you're sick and you
couldn't do it on day four,

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:34.160
then we have that option.

00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:37.795
And those are scheduled in the
lab syllabus in your packets.

00:21:43.690 --> 00:21:46.240
Safety goggles.

00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:50.530
You have to buy these
at the VWR stockroom,

00:21:50.530 --> 00:21:53.350
the basement of building 56.

00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:58.800
And I mean, you put these on
and they actually really--

00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:01.360
they hug your face.

00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:04.960
They don't look too
glamorous, but you're not

00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:06.490
going to a beauty contest.

00:22:06.490 --> 00:22:08.650
You're going to the lab.

00:22:08.650 --> 00:22:11.050
But you've got to
buy a pair of these.

00:22:11.050 --> 00:22:17.420
And you've got to wear
them at all times.

00:22:17.420 --> 00:22:22.390
The other thing is your lab coat
is a fire-resistant lab coat.

00:22:22.390 --> 00:22:25.720
These are top of
the line lab coats.

00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:28.990
We issue you one of
these when you come.

00:22:28.990 --> 00:22:31.820
We'll also give you
a baggy like this.

00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:34.030
And you can write
your name on the bag

00:22:34.030 --> 00:22:37.510
and hang it in your
locker and leave it there.

00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:39.010
You never take it
out of the lab.

00:22:39.010 --> 00:22:39.802
You leave it there.

00:22:39.802 --> 00:22:43.180
And first thing you do when you
come in, at either entrance,

00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:45.970
either from building
13 or building 16

00:22:45.970 --> 00:22:48.940
when you enter building
12, you'll have lockers.

00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:52.180
And you can grab your lab
coat and goggles, put them on,

00:22:52.180 --> 00:22:54.100
and you'll be ready for the lab.

00:22:58.610 --> 00:23:00.050
We've got plenty of gloves.

00:23:00.050 --> 00:23:01.850
We use nitrile gloves.

00:23:01.850 --> 00:23:06.630
And generally, those gloves do
not give students any problems.

00:23:06.630 --> 00:23:11.240
But if you have an issue
with that, just let us know.

00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:12.410
The attire.

00:23:12.410 --> 00:23:15.620
So the lab coats have
to be worn at all times.

00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:20.300
And you can't wear-- you can't
come in with open-toed shoes,

00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:23.000
low cut jeans, t-shirts.

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:25.850
You have to be really covered.

00:23:25.850 --> 00:23:29.330
So my suggestion
is that you bring

00:23:29.330 --> 00:23:33.110
a little bag, a
change of clothes,

00:23:33.110 --> 00:23:34.730
and you keep it in the locker.

00:23:34.730 --> 00:23:37.140
Students did this last semester.

00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:38.760
It worked really well.

00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:41.037
And then you can just change
out and change out again

00:23:41.037 --> 00:23:41.870
when you're leaving.

00:23:41.870 --> 00:23:44.330
And that way you can wear
your sandals, and your shorts,

00:23:44.330 --> 00:23:48.440
and anything you want, but you
can't wear that in the lab.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:57.520
Cell phones, radios, iPods.

00:23:57.520 --> 00:24:00.220
You have to keep those
in your backpacks.

00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:04.270
And this is what the lockers
look like at the entryway.

00:24:04.270 --> 00:24:06.910
So you just grab one of those.

00:24:06.910 --> 00:24:09.850
And that'll become your locker.

00:24:09.850 --> 00:24:11.740
Once you hang your
lab coat in there,

00:24:11.740 --> 00:24:14.300
no one else is going to
put anything in there.

00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:17.470
And we've never had any
problems with the lockers

00:24:17.470 --> 00:24:18.940
in the undergraduate lab.

00:24:18.940 --> 00:24:21.680
If you want to put a lock on
your locker for the semester,

00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:22.690
that's fine with me.

00:24:26.370 --> 00:24:29.910
Obviously, no eating
and drinking in the lab.

00:24:29.910 --> 00:24:33.600
You can't bring beverages
and food into the lab.

00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:37.110
There are chemicals on the
countertops and around that you

00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:37.830
just--

00:24:37.830 --> 00:24:39.555
chemicals and food
just don't mix.

00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:44.300
This is very important.

00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:48.200
Report any accidents
or injuries promptly.

00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:53.840
So if you do get cut or you
spill a chemical on yourself,

00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:55.460
you should tell us.

00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:59.060
If you leave the lab and then a
couple of days later come back

00:24:59.060 --> 00:25:04.370
and you've broken out in a
red rash on your legs or arms,

00:25:04.370 --> 00:25:07.190
it's much harder for
us to go back and try

00:25:07.190 --> 00:25:09.230
to figure out what happened.

00:25:09.230 --> 00:25:12.980
But if you tell us right away,
then we can track it down.

00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:15.350
We know what chemical it was.

00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:18.410
We know how to treat it.

00:25:18.410 --> 00:25:23.890
And MIT Health will
help with that.

00:25:23.890 --> 00:25:26.320
If you need special
accommodations

00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:30.340
or you've got medical
conditions that you

00:25:30.340 --> 00:25:34.390
would like to talk about, you
can come and see me on that.

00:25:34.390 --> 00:25:39.020
And you should do it this week
just so we're aware of it.

00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:40.990
And I mean we don't want--

00:25:40.990 --> 00:25:44.170
we had a student
about three years ago

00:25:44.170 --> 00:25:47.320
who just passed out in the lab.

00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:49.820
I mean literally
down on the floor.

00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:51.220
She was out.

00:25:51.220 --> 00:25:55.630
And if we know ahead
of time if there

00:25:55.630 --> 00:25:58.630
is a condition or something
that we should be aware of,

00:25:58.630 --> 00:26:01.180
we can know better
how to treat that.

00:26:05.810 --> 00:26:06.980
Grading.

00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:08.870
This is the grading scale.

00:26:08.870 --> 00:26:10.580
Pretty traditional.

00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:14.570
It's not inflated
and it's not curved.

00:26:14.570 --> 00:26:17.930
So it's a traditional
grading scale.

00:26:17.930 --> 00:26:25.620
And this is what
we use in 5.310.

00:26:25.620 --> 00:26:29.310
So the grading is all
based on five labs.

00:26:29.310 --> 00:26:32.130
Each lab is worth 100 points.

00:26:32.130 --> 00:26:36.620
Total number of points
is 500 for the course.

00:26:36.620 --> 00:26:38.330
And this will make you happy.

00:26:38.330 --> 00:26:39.455
There's no final exam.

00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:46.350
There was a final
exam when I took over

00:26:46.350 --> 00:26:47.860
this course 10 years ago.

00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:49.080
But I got rid of it.

00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:50.400
It was not nice.

00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:55.030
So you've got 500 points.

00:26:55.030 --> 00:26:56.600
And how is that broken down?

00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:06.410
So of that 100 points, 20 points
is your quiz that you'll take.

00:27:06.410 --> 00:27:08.720
So that incorporates into that.

00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:10.850
Then you have your
pre-lab notebook

00:27:10.850 --> 00:27:13.040
and your post-lab notebook.

00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:15.020
That's 10 points.

00:27:15.020 --> 00:27:17.120
Then there are 5
points which are

00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:21.840
noted as discretionary
points for the TA.

00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:27.570
And that would be like does
this student show up on time.

00:27:27.570 --> 00:27:31.440
Does the student clean up their
area at the end of the lab?

00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:34.200
Does the student wear
their safety glasses

00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:37.410
or do they walk around with
the glasses up in the air?

00:27:37.410 --> 00:27:39.730
So that's important.

00:27:39.730 --> 00:27:42.790
And then your lab report,
either written or oral,

00:27:42.790 --> 00:27:44.230
would be 65 points.

00:27:47.270 --> 00:27:51.250
I'll show you this is
the course textbook.

00:27:51.250 --> 00:27:53.910
This is the book that we
recommend that you get.

00:27:53.910 --> 00:27:55.020
It's Mohrig.

00:27:55.020 --> 00:27:58.800
and it's Laboratory Techniques
in Organic Chemistry.

00:27:58.800 --> 00:27:59.790
Very good book.

00:27:59.790 --> 00:28:04.380
It has chapters on all
of the instrumentation

00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:08.130
and a lot of the techniques
that you'll be actually using

00:28:08.130 --> 00:28:09.450
in the course.

00:28:09.450 --> 00:28:12.030
Well worth to buy this book.

00:28:12.030 --> 00:28:16.410
The other book that is not
required but it's on reserve

00:28:16.410 --> 00:28:20.370
and we have copies in the
lab is this ACS style guide.

00:28:20.370 --> 00:28:25.050
This will help you in terms of
writing up your lab reports,

00:28:25.050 --> 00:28:26.790
writing up the
reference section,

00:28:26.790 --> 00:28:30.045
knowing how correctly
to put things together.

00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:35.360
Attendance.

00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:38.720
Attendance is not
mandatory for this class.

00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:41.600
But there is an attendance
sheet going around.

00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:47.450
And each lecture day
we will send it around.

00:28:47.450 --> 00:28:50.210
If you don't attend
lecture, your grade

00:28:50.210 --> 00:28:52.430
isn't going to be penalized.

00:28:52.430 --> 00:28:55.220
But if you do attend
all of the lectures,

00:28:55.220 --> 00:28:58.820
at the end of the semester,
if your grade somehow

00:28:58.820 --> 00:29:02.780
is within a half a
point of a higher grade,

00:29:02.780 --> 00:29:07.570
89.5, technically
you'd get a B plus,

00:29:07.570 --> 00:29:10.330
we'll look at the
lecture attendance

00:29:10.330 --> 00:29:15.110
and that grade could be
pushed up to an A minus.

00:29:15.110 --> 00:29:17.260
So that's how the
lecture attendance

00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:18.755
works into this system.

00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:27.620
And if you have any questions
as I'm going along, just ask.

00:29:27.620 --> 00:29:30.050
So to get a passing
grade in 5.310,

00:29:30.050 --> 00:29:33.230
you need to turn in the four
written reports and you need

00:29:33.230 --> 00:29:35.750
to deliver the oral report.

00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:38.540
There are some penalties.

00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:50.060
So for a late lab, we
use three times n minus 1

00:29:50.060 --> 00:29:59.250
plus 2, where n equals the
number of days the lab is late.

00:29:59.250 --> 00:30:03.390
Also, with each lab, you
need to attach a cover sheet

00:30:03.390 --> 00:30:05.760
to your written lab.

00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:14.075
No cover sheet is
minus 2 points.

00:30:17.220 --> 00:30:20.390
There are also some late
points on the oral report.

00:30:20.390 --> 00:30:24.500
If you're late for an oral
report, it's minus five points.

00:30:24.500 --> 00:30:26.510
If it has to be
rescheduled, it's

00:30:26.510 --> 00:30:30.740
minus 10 points, just so you're
aware of the late points.

00:30:30.740 --> 00:30:33.920
You don't want to use
these if you don't have to.

00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:37.160
You really want to try to
turn your labs in on time.

00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:41.810
And that two points
or five points

00:30:41.810 --> 00:30:44.090
could make a big
difference at the end.

00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:58.200
So this is the hard copy
of the course manual.

00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:02.410
And you'll be allowed to
bring this in with you to lab.

00:31:02.410 --> 00:31:06.270
You don't have to write up
the pre-lab step by step

00:31:06.270 --> 00:31:07.270
that you're going to do.

00:31:07.270 --> 00:31:09.400
You can bring this
in and follow it.

00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:12.970
So we're saving you a
couple hours a week here.

00:31:12.970 --> 00:31:15.850
I hope you appreciate that.

00:31:15.850 --> 00:31:19.390
Students used to have to write
the pre-lab out step by step

00:31:19.390 --> 00:31:21.970
in their own words.

00:31:21.970 --> 00:31:24.830
So this is a big
time saver for you.

00:31:24.830 --> 00:31:28.780
I want to keep this course
under that 12 credit limits.

00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:35.780
You will need a lab notebook.

00:31:35.780 --> 00:31:40.700
And the lab notebooks are
available either at the MIT

00:31:40.700 --> 00:31:44.960
Coop or they have them
at the VWR stock room.

00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:47.430
And they're around $15.

00:31:47.430 --> 00:31:52.580
And the notebook should be
like 100 duplicate pages

00:31:52.580 --> 00:31:56.540
with carbonless paper because
what's going to happen

00:31:56.540 --> 00:32:02.390
is each day you go to lab, the
TA will initial your pre-lab.

00:32:02.390 --> 00:32:04.880
And then at the end of
lab, you'll go to the TA

00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:06.260
with your notebook.

00:32:06.260 --> 00:32:10.550
And the TA will initial each
page of your post-lab notes.

00:32:10.550 --> 00:32:14.260
Then you'll tear them all
out and hand them to your TA.

00:32:14.260 --> 00:32:15.410
You keep the original.

00:32:15.410 --> 00:32:17.510
We get the copy.

00:32:17.510 --> 00:32:22.190
The reason for that is when
it comes down to the final lab

00:32:22.190 --> 00:32:26.360
report, you cannot have anything
in the lab report that's not

00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:31.050
in your post-lab notes
in your notebook.

00:32:31.050 --> 00:32:35.940
So let's just take a
quick look and see.

00:32:35.940 --> 00:32:39.480
For the pre-lab, this
is pretty simple.

00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:41.660
You don't have to write
out the whole procedure,

00:32:41.660 --> 00:32:44.010
but you do need to
have your title, date,

00:32:44.010 --> 00:32:48.620
the name of the experiment,
an introduction, a couple

00:32:48.620 --> 00:32:52.040
of sentences what this
experiment is about,

00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:56.660
what you hope to get out of
it, maybe a couple of sentences

00:32:56.660 --> 00:33:01.520
on safety issues that you
spotted in the experiment,

00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:06.640
and then any pre-lab equations
you think you'll need.

00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:11.440
The first pre-lab is due
Monday and Tuesday next week.

00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:13.540
That's when the lab
actually will commence.

00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:20.440
Tables are very good to
put in your lab notebook

00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:25.210
and in your lab reports
as well as drawings

00:33:25.210 --> 00:33:28.030
that might help you
to actually visualize

00:33:28.030 --> 00:33:31.480
what you're setting up.

00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:36.010
For the post-lab,
this is probably

00:33:36.010 --> 00:33:39.430
the most detailed
part because you've

00:33:39.430 --> 00:33:42.640
got to write everything down
that you're doing in lab,

00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:47.710
all your observations,
everything that's happening.

00:33:47.710 --> 00:33:49.763
When you're over at
the distillation,

00:33:49.763 --> 00:33:52.180
you're going to record the
temperature that the distillate

00:33:52.180 --> 00:33:53.800
started to come over.

00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:57.100
You're going to record the drops
per minute that's coming over.

00:33:57.100 --> 00:34:00.610
All of these notes
go into your lab book

00:34:00.610 --> 00:34:04.450
while you're working in the lab.

00:34:04.450 --> 00:34:12.110
So let me show you a couple
examples of lab notebooks, what

00:34:12.110 --> 00:34:13.790
students have done.

00:34:13.790 --> 00:34:17.330
This is one example
where a student had--

00:34:17.330 --> 00:34:24.250
sorry-- where a student had put
their pre-lab notes on one side

00:34:24.250 --> 00:34:28.489
and left the other side
for their post-lab.

00:34:28.489 --> 00:34:30.560
This isn't necessarily
the best way

00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:33.409
to do it because you don't
know how much space to leave

00:34:33.409 --> 00:34:35.690
for your post-lab.

00:34:35.690 --> 00:34:41.150
So another way to
do it would be just

00:34:41.150 --> 00:34:45.830
to write out your
pre-lab on one page,

00:34:45.830 --> 00:34:51.530
and then stop, and then start
your post-lab on the next page.

00:34:51.530 --> 00:34:54.889
The other thing that
comes up is these

00:34:54.889 --> 00:34:57.470
are four to five day labs.

00:34:57.470 --> 00:35:01.430
So when you read the whole
experiment, one way to do it

00:35:01.430 --> 00:35:04.250
is write your lab up
for the whole experiment

00:35:04.250 --> 00:35:05.690
all in one time.

00:35:05.690 --> 00:35:08.840
Then you don't have to
write it up each time.

00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:11.130
That works for a
lot of students.

00:35:11.130 --> 00:35:14.990
But we only require you to
write the pre-lab for the day

00:35:14.990 --> 00:35:19.770
that you're actually doing.

00:35:19.770 --> 00:35:23.300
So I want to talk just a bit
about some questions that

00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:28.400
come up a lot, like what is
the stability of my chemicals.

00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:31.280
You're going to be
working with some very air

00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:33.540
sensitive chemicals.

00:35:33.540 --> 00:35:36.500
So you might go over to
the balance area and mass

00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:39.180
out your chemical
for the first lab.

00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:42.740
You have iron
chloride tetrahydrate.

00:35:42.740 --> 00:35:46.100
You mass that out but
then you walk away.

00:35:46.100 --> 00:35:48.410
If you don't put the
cover on the chemical,

00:35:48.410 --> 00:35:50.960
the green chemical
will turn brown.

00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:54.350
And it's not going to be any
good for the other students who

00:35:54.350 --> 00:35:58.220
are doing the lab because
the iron gets oxidized.

00:35:58.220 --> 00:36:01.370
And you need iron-2
to do the experiment.

00:36:01.370 --> 00:36:03.090
So be aware of that.

00:36:03.090 --> 00:36:06.035
And then how do I get what I
need from a stock solution?

00:36:08.690 --> 00:36:11.480
So you're going to see
chemicals like this labeled

00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:14.380
stock solutions for the lab.

00:36:14.380 --> 00:36:16.090
The one thing you
don't want to do

00:36:16.090 --> 00:36:20.470
is open this up and go
into a stock solution

00:36:20.470 --> 00:36:23.560
with a dirty pipette,
because if you

00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:27.310
do that, you'll contaminate the
solution for the whole class.

00:36:27.310 --> 00:36:30.070
And some of the experiments
are really quantitative

00:36:30.070 --> 00:36:33.130
and very sensitive,
especially the Charles River

00:36:33.130 --> 00:36:36.610
where we're looking at
the phosphate levels.

00:36:36.610 --> 00:36:39.580
So what you want to do is
you want to make sure that--

00:36:39.580 --> 00:36:41.710
and the TA should do this--

00:36:41.710 --> 00:36:46.060
have these chemicals poured
out in labeled beakers

00:36:46.060 --> 00:36:48.940
so that they're ready
for the students

00:36:48.940 --> 00:36:52.210
to actually go into and
draw out what they need.

00:36:52.210 --> 00:36:55.210
If you don't see that,
always ask your TA.

00:36:55.210 --> 00:36:58.690
Never go directly into
the stock solution.

00:36:58.690 --> 00:37:00.970
And then the order
in which you add

00:37:00.970 --> 00:37:03.700
chemicals is very important.

00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:08.440
You always want
to-- you always want

00:37:08.440 --> 00:37:19.790
to go from the concentrated
to the less concentrated.

00:37:25.780 --> 00:37:28.870
You would never want to
take water and add it

00:37:28.870 --> 00:37:33.700
to acid because it would
splash right back in your face.

00:37:33.700 --> 00:37:35.380
You always want
to go the reverse.

00:37:35.380 --> 00:37:38.170
Add the acid to the water.

00:37:38.170 --> 00:37:41.260
Concentrated to
less concentrated.

00:37:41.260 --> 00:37:45.860
And if you spill chemicals
while working, let us know.

00:37:45.860 --> 00:37:46.730
It's very important.

00:37:46.730 --> 00:37:49.150
Don't leave them.

00:37:49.150 --> 00:37:54.430
A couple or few years ago,
we had a class during IAP.

00:37:54.430 --> 00:37:58.210
And one of the freshmen
spilled a half a bottle of urea

00:37:58.210 --> 00:38:01.690
on the floor and left it.

00:38:01.690 --> 00:38:04.100
And the TA was beside himself.

00:38:04.100 --> 00:38:06.220
He was saying who did this.

00:38:06.220 --> 00:38:09.230
Nobody would own up to it.

00:38:09.230 --> 00:38:12.310
But we just happened to
be filming this class.

00:38:12.310 --> 00:38:15.100
And there is a video online
that you can go watch.

00:38:15.100 --> 00:38:16.390
And you can see--

00:38:16.390 --> 00:38:20.770
you'll know who it is
when you watch the video.

00:38:20.770 --> 00:38:22.660
So you always want
to let us know.

00:38:22.660 --> 00:38:26.170
And we always want to clean
up if there is a spill.

00:38:26.170 --> 00:38:29.710
And if it's a spill, you have
to let us know right away.

00:38:29.710 --> 00:38:33.190
We have to determine
how bad it is

00:38:33.190 --> 00:38:37.960
so we don't have to evacuate
the lab or something.

00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:41.320
And then if you get
chemicals on yourself,

00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:44.890
you know you've got to let
us know because chemicals

00:38:44.890 --> 00:38:49.960
on yourself, we can take
care of it right on the spot,

00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:52.240
get you washed off.

00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:55.180
If we have to, we'll walk
you over to MIT Health

00:38:55.180 --> 00:38:58.060
to have them look at it.

00:38:58.060 --> 00:39:00.490
And chemical waste.

00:39:00.490 --> 00:39:02.170
There are a lot
of different kinds

00:39:02.170 --> 00:39:04.720
of waste containers in the lab.

00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:09.880
We've got boxes here
for glass and plastic.

00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:11.590
And you've got to
look at the box

00:39:11.590 --> 00:39:13.750
before you throw something in.

00:39:13.750 --> 00:39:16.780
Broken glass would
go in the glass box.

00:39:16.780 --> 00:39:21.460
Plastic pipette tips
go in the plastic box.

00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:24.490
And make sure that you
empty them of your chemical

00:39:24.490 --> 00:39:29.050
first into the waste container
before you throw the pipette's

00:39:29.050 --> 00:39:32.140
tips into the box.

00:39:32.140 --> 00:39:35.980
There are bottles
for liquid waste.

00:39:35.980 --> 00:39:38.140
And everything is labeled.

00:39:38.140 --> 00:39:41.222
You can see the red labels here.

00:39:41.222 --> 00:39:42.680
A couple of things
you should know.

00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:45.070
Don't pour into the top of this.

00:39:45.070 --> 00:39:51.460
This is a lid so that
it actually opens up

00:39:51.460 --> 00:39:53.290
and then you pour it in.

00:39:53.290 --> 00:39:55.810
And then you always have
to close this container

00:39:55.810 --> 00:39:58.510
after you've added your waste.

00:39:58.510 --> 00:40:03.430
If you leave a waste container
open during an active lab

00:40:03.430 --> 00:40:09.610
and we're inspected, MIT can
be fined thousands of dollars.

00:40:09.610 --> 00:40:12.870
So you've got to keep the
waste containers closed.

00:40:12.870 --> 00:40:15.100
The other thing is you've
got to be aware of what

00:40:15.100 --> 00:40:16.390
you're putting in.

00:40:16.390 --> 00:40:17.980
So read the container.

00:40:17.980 --> 00:40:22.780
Make sure it's the chemical that
you're using that's going in.

00:40:22.780 --> 00:40:28.000
You never want to put
acetone in to anything

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:30.790
except a bottle
that says acetone,

00:40:30.790 --> 00:40:32.920
because we're going
to be using hydrogen

00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:36.670
peroxide in this class.

00:40:36.670 --> 00:40:43.160
And hydrogen
peroxide and acetone

00:40:43.160 --> 00:40:46.840
and you have an explosion.

00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:52.480
So what you're making is
you're actually creating

00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:57.820
these acetone peroxy compounds.

00:40:57.820 --> 00:41:01.010
This is the dimer.

00:41:01.010 --> 00:41:05.510
It's called acetone
peroxide explosive apex.

00:41:05.510 --> 00:41:07.805
And then there's also a trimer.

00:41:20.150 --> 00:41:27.850
And this is the
triacetone peroxide.

00:41:30.370 --> 00:41:33.040
So what happens with
these is they form

00:41:33.040 --> 00:41:35.800
a white crystalline powder.

00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:37.990
And it smells like bleach.

00:41:37.990 --> 00:41:42.670
And when that forms, just any
movement could trigger it.

00:41:42.670 --> 00:41:46.600
This is the same stuff that
the shoe bomber had in his shoe

00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:50.050
if some of you remember
10 years ago on the plane.

00:41:50.050 --> 00:41:51.910
And so it's very frightening.

00:41:51.910 --> 00:41:54.580
So you have to be
mindful of what you're

00:41:54.580 --> 00:41:56.350
putting in the containers.

00:41:56.350 --> 00:41:58.300
The acetone we're
going to recycle.

00:41:58.300 --> 00:42:01.750
So it will have containers
just for acetone.

00:42:01.750 --> 00:42:03.890
And that's where you're
going to dump it.

00:42:03.890 --> 00:42:10.000
The other thing you want to
be aware of is nitric acid.

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:13.840
We're using nitric acid
in the Charles River lab.

00:42:13.840 --> 00:42:18.790
You don't want to mix this with
any kind of organic solvents.

00:42:18.790 --> 00:42:24.040
If we put this,
say, with ethanol,

00:42:24.040 --> 00:42:35.875
then you're making this
C2H5 ethyl nitrate.

00:42:41.070 --> 00:42:46.167
And this is also a
primary explosive.

00:42:46.167 --> 00:42:47.750
The first thing that
happens is you'll

00:42:47.750 --> 00:42:50.060
see orange smoke billowing out.

00:42:50.060 --> 00:42:52.910
And then you'll hear
this whining noise.

00:42:52.910 --> 00:42:55.040
And it gets louder and louder.

00:42:55.040 --> 00:42:57.410
And then the hood goes.

00:42:57.410 --> 00:42:59.060
The ceiling goes.

00:42:59.060 --> 00:43:04.040
So if you see smoke or you hear
noises, get away from the hood.

00:43:04.040 --> 00:43:06.470
But don't put nitric
acid with anything

00:43:06.470 --> 00:43:09.215
except in the container
that says nitric acid.

00:43:12.600 --> 00:43:17.840
There are also some containers
for solid waste by the scales.

00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:20.820
So as you're massing
your chemicals out,

00:43:20.820 --> 00:43:22.350
if you have a little
bit left over,

00:43:22.350 --> 00:43:27.100
they go in the can with
you with your weigh boats.

00:43:27.100 --> 00:43:29.080
Don't put gloves into the cans.

00:43:29.080 --> 00:43:32.640
Gloves can go in the trash.

00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:37.010
We have a box for needles
here, which is great.

00:43:37.010 --> 00:43:41.000
And don't put
needles in the trash,

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:44.420
because the cleaners grab
those trash bags at night

00:43:44.420 --> 00:43:46.640
and they could get poked.

00:43:46.640 --> 00:43:48.600
And that would not be good.

00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:51.120
So the needles, we're going
to try to count them out.

00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:53.720
And the TA will be
judicious in coming around

00:43:53.720 --> 00:43:57.870
with the needle box and
collect them at the end.

00:43:57.870 --> 00:43:59.430
Calibration of melting point.

00:43:59.430 --> 00:44:03.600
I just want to show
you one thing here.

00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:05.370
If you go to the
melting point and you

00:44:05.370 --> 00:44:09.100
take a melting point
of your sample,

00:44:09.100 --> 00:44:11.350
an uncalibrated
melting temperature

00:44:11.350 --> 00:44:14.870
might be 64 to 66 degrees.

00:44:14.870 --> 00:44:20.580
Once it's calibrated, you're
up to 79 to 80.9 degrees.

00:44:20.580 --> 00:44:22.880
So we have four standards.

00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:26.450
And each standard has a
range where it starts to melt

00:44:26.450 --> 00:44:28.340
and ends melting.

00:44:28.340 --> 00:44:30.350
So you put your standard in.

00:44:30.350 --> 00:44:33.740
Then you look through the scope.

00:44:33.740 --> 00:44:36.650
And you record
your observed where

00:44:36.650 --> 00:44:39.500
it's melting, when it
started, when it stopped.

00:44:39.500 --> 00:44:42.140
And you have two points
for each standard.

00:44:42.140 --> 00:44:44.240
So you can do a
linear regression

00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:47.870
and draw a straight line and
get an equation for the line.

00:44:47.870 --> 00:44:52.430
And then every time that you
use that melting temperature,

00:44:52.430 --> 00:44:53.540
you can calculate--

00:44:56.456 --> 00:45:03.400
you put in your experimental
and calculate what

00:45:03.400 --> 00:45:05.365
it should be from the equation.

00:45:09.910 --> 00:45:13.620
So we've got we've got a
couple of minutes left.

00:45:13.620 --> 00:45:16.030
And this is a chemistry class.

00:45:16.030 --> 00:45:19.470
So I'd like to do a
demonstration just

00:45:19.470 --> 00:45:21.540
to end this class.

00:45:21.540 --> 00:45:23.100
And I need a volunteer.

00:45:29.980 --> 00:45:30.490
Yes.

00:45:30.490 --> 00:45:30.990
Come on.

00:45:35.410 --> 00:45:36.442
And what is your name?

00:45:36.442 --> 00:45:37.150
AUDIENCE: Autumn.

00:45:37.150 --> 00:45:37.945
PROFESSOR: Autumn.

00:45:37.945 --> 00:45:38.680
OK, Autumn.

00:45:38.680 --> 00:45:43.910
So Autumn, I've got a
cup here and some water.

00:45:43.910 --> 00:45:46.660
So I'm going to pour
some water into the cup.

00:45:46.660 --> 00:45:48.020
And you tell me when to stop.

00:45:48.020 --> 00:45:48.520
OK?

00:45:51.999 --> 00:45:52.727
AUDIENCE: Stop.

00:45:52.727 --> 00:45:53.310
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:45:57.220 --> 00:45:59.620
So what I'm going to do is
I'm going to cover this up.

00:45:59.620 --> 00:46:01.480
OK.

00:46:01.480 --> 00:46:04.260
And then I'm going to
carefully turn this over.

00:46:08.750 --> 00:46:11.720
So far so good, right?

00:46:11.720 --> 00:46:14.780
You know where I'm
going with this, Autumn?

00:46:14.780 --> 00:46:18.490
I'm going to put
it on your head.

00:46:18.490 --> 00:46:20.410
Face your fellow students.

00:46:20.410 --> 00:46:23.410
And we'll go up
here very gently.

00:46:23.410 --> 00:46:25.660
And there we go.

00:46:25.660 --> 00:46:27.670
Now I'm going to let
you hold it, Autumn,

00:46:27.670 --> 00:46:29.920
because I don't want
to be responsible.

00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:31.390
OK.

00:46:31.390 --> 00:46:32.200
OK.

00:46:32.200 --> 00:46:33.327
You OK so far?

00:46:33.327 --> 00:46:33.910
AUDIENCE: Yep.

00:46:33.910 --> 00:46:34.610
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:46:34.610 --> 00:46:35.110
All right.

00:46:37.900 --> 00:46:41.580
Autumn, what does this say?

00:46:41.580 --> 00:46:43.482
AUDIENCE: Do not
remove this card.

00:46:43.482 --> 00:46:45.280
PROFESSOR: Whoops.

00:46:45.280 --> 00:46:45.780
OK.

00:46:45.780 --> 00:46:48.416
Let me take this
off from Autumn.

00:46:48.416 --> 00:46:50.350
AUDIENCE: What's on my head?

00:46:50.350 --> 00:46:53.780
PROFESSOR: What happened
to the water, Autumn?

00:46:53.780 --> 00:46:57.267
AUDIENCE: Is there something
inside that absorbed it?

00:46:57.267 --> 00:46:58.850
PROFESSOR: She said
is there something

00:46:58.850 --> 00:47:00.150
inside that absorbed it?

00:47:00.150 --> 00:47:00.650
OK.

00:47:00.650 --> 00:47:01.900
Let's see what we got here.

00:47:04.730 --> 00:47:06.375
We made a polymer.

00:47:06.375 --> 00:47:07.000
AUDIENCE: Cool.

00:47:10.220 --> 00:47:13.280
PROFESSOR: So
unbeknownst to Autumn,

00:47:13.280 --> 00:47:15.950
I had a little bit
of powder in her cup.

00:47:15.950 --> 00:47:28.742
And when I put the water in,
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

00:47:28.742 --> 00:47:30.284
AUDIENCE: What kind
of polymer is it?

00:47:30.284 --> 00:47:32.159
PROFESSOR: I knew you
were going to ask that.

00:47:32.159 --> 00:47:33.385
What kind of polymer is this?

00:47:33.385 --> 00:47:34.510
AUDIENCE: I'm Course three.

00:47:34.510 --> 00:47:35.093
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:47:35.093 --> 00:47:38.808
So you'll all know this.

00:47:38.808 --> 00:47:40.100
Hold that for a minute, Autumn.

00:47:40.100 --> 00:47:41.920
This is the diaper polymer.

00:47:41.920 --> 00:47:44.680
This is sodium polyacrylate.

00:47:44.680 --> 00:47:48.020
And I actually took
one of these diapers.

00:47:48.020 --> 00:47:49.165
And I cut it open.

00:47:49.165 --> 00:47:53.710
And I got 4 grams of sodium
polyacrylate out of the diaper.

00:47:53.710 --> 00:47:55.540
So this is how they work.

00:47:55.540 --> 00:47:59.710
These polymers, you can
see this polyacrylate

00:47:59.710 --> 00:48:02.080
is a monomer repeating unit.

00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:05.110
And what happens is
if you look inside,

00:48:05.110 --> 00:48:07.180
it has a lot of sodiums.

00:48:07.180 --> 00:48:10.090
But when we put the
water around it,

00:48:10.090 --> 00:48:15.730
it starts to send sodium out
and pull water in by osmosis

00:48:15.730 --> 00:48:19.100
to balance the sodium atoms.

00:48:19.100 --> 00:48:21.490
So all of a sudden it swells up.

00:48:21.490 --> 00:48:24.380
And you've got this system here.

00:48:24.380 --> 00:48:26.410
Now we're going to do
a little experiment.

00:48:26.410 --> 00:48:34.040
We're going to take this
and put those on now.

00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:43.380
OK.

00:48:43.380 --> 00:48:48.240
So I'm going to take this and
put it into a little baggy.

00:48:48.240 --> 00:48:48.918
Hold that bag.

00:48:48.918 --> 00:48:50.210
AUDIENCE: Add salt [INAUDIBLE].

00:48:50.210 --> 00:48:53.030
PROFESSOR: I'm going to
add some salt to this.

00:48:53.030 --> 00:48:57.110
And now we're doing the
reverse of what we just did.

00:48:57.110 --> 00:48:59.510
We had added water
to the polymer before

00:48:59.510 --> 00:49:01.040
but now we're putting salt in.

00:49:04.230 --> 00:49:05.790
So just zip that bag up.

00:49:09.010 --> 00:49:10.468
And this is the
fun part, Autumn.

00:49:10.468 --> 00:49:11.635
You get to squish it around.

00:49:15.010 --> 00:49:20.320
So now there are sodium ions
on the outside of the polymer.

00:49:20.320 --> 00:49:21.430
And it's panicking.

00:49:21.430 --> 00:49:24.280
It's starting to pull them
in and send some of the water

00:49:24.280 --> 00:49:26.150
back out.

00:49:26.150 --> 00:49:29.870
So the polymer is actually
going back to a liquid.

00:49:29.870 --> 00:49:33.010
So that's how this works.

00:49:33.010 --> 00:49:33.910
Great.

00:49:33.910 --> 00:49:34.750
Give her a hand.

00:49:34.750 --> 00:49:36.830
She did a great job.

00:49:36.830 --> 00:49:38.063
Thank you so much, Autumn.

00:49:42.230 --> 00:49:43.330
Well, thank you all.

00:49:43.330 --> 00:49:47.110
And the next lecture is Tuesday.

00:49:47.110 --> 00:49:50.020
Don't forget to go to
the safety lecture.

00:49:50.020 --> 00:49:54.120
And that is downstairs,
two flights down.

00:00:21.337 --> 00:00:22.420
PROFESSOR: Good afternoon.

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:29.200
Usually, my first
question is do you

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:33.310
have any questions
about the last lecture?

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:37.370
We did this fly over
over 100 equations

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.940
to go from first principles to
the [INAUDIBLE] Hamiltonian.

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.600
I've put up here for you
the overview of this course.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.850
I won't go through it again.

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.550
But I want to sort of make
you aware that we started

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:57.700
with the fundamental Hamiltonian
for light atom interactions.

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.990
But now we take a step back.

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:04.060
In the next few lectures,
we simply talk about light.

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:05.960
We talk about photons.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.530
We talk about the quantum
nature of photons.

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.530
And then, after understanding
photons in more depth,

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.819
we come back and look at
more depths at atom photon

00:01:17.819 --> 00:01:18.360
interactions.

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:30.190
Let me just give you a pictorial
summary of what I've just said.

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:36.770
AMO physics is about
atoms and photons.

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:43.650
And in a cartoon like
way, I can symbolize atoms

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:45.725
by two level systems.

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.980
Or sometimes, we have
a two level system

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:53.460
which is coupled by
tunneling that's also

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.650
equivalent to a
two level system.

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:06.580
And then we have photons,
two state systems.

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:07.990
And photons are different.

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:13.200
Photons are not
two state systems.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.240
They are actually
harmonic oscillators.

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.770
Usually, electromagnetic waves.

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.720
But Hamiltonians
for photons can be

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.830
and have been
realized by replacing

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:35.470
the harmonic oscillator with
the photon with vibrations,

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.910
for example, of
ions in an ion trap

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.520
or micromechanical oscillators.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:50.350
So cartoon picture again
is photons in a cavity.

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:59.615
But this is just another
harmonic oscillator.

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.380
So we have the atoms.

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:13.920
And most of what you
should know about atoms

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.060
has been discussed in 8.421.

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:21.000
For those of you who will
take 8.421 next year,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.070
we'll have a lot of fun talking
about the structure of atoms.

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:33.530
Photons, well, I
would hope a lot

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:36.490
of it, at least the
harmonic oscillator aspects,

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:41.520
you took in 8.05 or in 8.321.

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:49.200
And actually, starting
today in this unit,

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.800
we want to talk about
the quantum age of light.

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:59.280
So you can say 8.421, we had
a deep look at the atoms.

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.990
We have now look at the photons.

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:10.400
But eventually, what is very
important is the interactions

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.180
between the atoms
and the photons.

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:15.960
That's not all.

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.210
This is sort of a very
well defined system.

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:29.180
A two level system and one mode
of the harmonic oscillator.

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.570
But it will become
very important--

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:33.740
and that's what we'll
do in a few weeks--

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:37.060
to discuss what happens
when this system-,

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.900
the system above
the dotted line,

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:46.840
becomes an open system and we
interact with the reservoir.

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:51.450
The reservoir will be
relevant for relaxation.

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:54.640
Atoms can decohere, can
lose their decoherence.

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:57.280
Photons will decay or decohere.

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.840
Entanglement will get lost.

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:03.300
And this phenomenon
of relaxation

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:07.570
requires the formalism
of the master equation.

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:09.480
And we will find
the master equation

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:12.700
in the form of the
optical block equation.

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:17.840
If you want me to add in cartoon
picture of the reservoir,

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:24.420
I would add many, many
harmonic oscillators.

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:41.340
So reservoir is characterized
by having many modes

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:45.500
and having a capacity
to absorb energy

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:48.150
without changing its state.

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:52.750
So this is another kind
of illustrated summary

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:57.090
of what we will be doing
in the next few weeks.

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:00.830
And today, we want to talk about
the quantum nature of light.

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:13.640
We're actually talking
mainly about already

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:16.670
a very special form
of light, namely

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:19.600
monochromatic light
in a single mode

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:22.384
of the harmonic oscillator.

00:06:22.384 --> 00:06:25.220
And there is still a
lot to be discussed

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:28.370
about the statistics,
about squeezed states,

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:31.470
about coherent states.

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:38.110
We want to understand how
the quantum state of light

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:41.649
is modified, is
transformed, by propagation,

00:06:41.649 --> 00:06:43.940
or how it's modified when
the light runs through a beam

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:45.380
splitter.

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:47.810
And all of this is
already relevant for just

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:49.380
a single mode.

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:54.000
And then very soon, we'll also
talk about two modes of light.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.370
Because we need two
modes if we want

00:06:56.370 --> 00:07:01.340
to talk about
entanglement of two modes.

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:03.870
I hope you will realize
in this discussion

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:07.140
that the quantum
nature of light is more

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:10.140
than light is a wave in the
form of electromagnetic wave,

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:13.190
or light is a particle
in the form of photons.

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:15.060
Things go much, much deeper.

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:25.530
So the unit on quantum
light will actually

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:29.023
evolve in six stages.

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:49.540
Today, we will be talking
about photons and statistics,

00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:54.740
fluctuation, coherent states.

00:07:54.740 --> 00:08:00.910
On next week, on
Monday, we want to talk

00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:09.650
about non-classical
light, states

00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:15.340
which have no classical
analogy in squeezed states.

00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:18.720
Eventually, we want to
focus on single photons.

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:26.795
We will then talk about
entangled photons.

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:39.460
The fifth part is on
interferometry, or more

00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:40.554
generally on metrology.

00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:45.820
We will talk about
the short noise

00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:48.290
limit and the
fundamental Heisenberg

00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:52.690
limit of performing
quantum measurements.

00:08:52.690 --> 00:08:59.770
And the last one is now opening
up the light to interactions

00:08:59.770 --> 00:09:01.600
with atoms.

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:03.630
So we will talk
about interaction

00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:09.600
of one photon and one atom
in this specific situation

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:12.700
of cavity QED.

00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:15.610
So this is an overview over
the next, I don't know,

00:09:15.610 --> 00:09:19.910
three, four, five, six lectures.

00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:43.760
Today, we start with a
very, very short review

00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:45.710
of the simple harmonic
oscillator, just

00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:47.195
to set the stage.

00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:53.290
I then want to show you
that in three minutes,

00:09:53.290 --> 00:09:56.430
I can discuss thermal
light and the Planck Law

00:09:56.430 --> 00:09:58.700
by just writing down
one or two equations

00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:02.440
in the formalism we have chosen.

00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:03.730
So we cover thermal states.

00:10:08.530 --> 00:10:10.640
When we do laser
physics, when we

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:16.640
have light atom in the action,
we always need coherent states.

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:19.077
And we talk about
quasi-probability

00:10:19.077 --> 00:10:19.660
distributions.

00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:30.410
We then want to understand
fluctuations, noise,

00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:35.200
and second order
correlation functions.

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:38.600
Probably this will spill
over into the next class.

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:43.060
We want to address
some properties

00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:45.960
of the single photon.

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:50.120
Which, as you will see,
it seems a simple system,

00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:53.610
but it is the most non-classical
system you can have,

00:10:53.610 --> 00:10:54.625
a single photon.

00:10:54.625 --> 00:10:58.480
But we'll come to that.

00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:04.490
Let's start with very,
very short review

00:11:04.490 --> 00:11:06.470
of the simple
harmonic oscillator.

00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:10.820
It just also connects me
with the last lecture.

00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:16.990
So how do we describe
light in a single mode?

00:11:16.990 --> 00:11:20.350
And single mode means it
is perfectly monochromatic.

00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:30.740
Well, we know that--
and that's what

00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:34.200
we did last class-- that
we have the Hamiltonian

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:39.550
for the electromagnetic
field, which is the quantum

00:11:39.550 --> 00:11:49.600
version of the electromagnetic
energy, B square E square.

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:55.730
And from that, we derived
the quantized Hamiltonian.

00:11:55.730 --> 00:12:00.130
We introduced, just as a
reminder, vector potentials,

00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:02.840
normal modes, and the
normal mode operators

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:05.530
became the a daggers.

00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:09.640
And in second quantization,
this is the Hamiltonian

00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:12.460
for light, which is of
course the Hamiltonian

00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:13.460
for harmonic oscillator.

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:22.570
What I need today is I have
to rewrite the harmonic

00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:23.680
oscillator.

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:27.770
And we have to look
at two variables--

00:12:27.770 --> 00:12:30.980
the momentum and the precision.

00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:33.490
Actually, the
momentum will later,

00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:35.140
I will show you
that the momentum

00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:37.650
of this harmonic
oscillator is actually

00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:39.860
the operator of
the electric field.

00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:43.630
So we need that in a second.

00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:46.640
And of course, I assume you
know from your knowledge

00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:51.560
of the harmonic oscillator
that precision and momentum are

00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:55.750
linear combinations, symmetric
and anti-symmetric, of a dagger

00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:58.110
a.

00:12:58.110 --> 00:13:02.810
And the unit is the
prefactor square root

00:13:02.810 --> 00:13:04.880
of h bar omega over 2.

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:10.800
Or here it is h
bar over 2 omega.

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:17.240
And of course, in precision
and momentum operators,

00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:22.080
the Hamiltonian is
simply p square,

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:25.760
should remind you
of kinetic energy.

00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:30.100
Omega square, Q square should
remind you of potential energy.

00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:38.000
When we discuss light, we want
to discuss the electric field.

00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:44.140
I had shown you in
one of those 100

00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:54.950
equations the operator
for the electric field.

00:13:58.090 --> 00:14:02.090
The operator for
the electric field

00:14:02.090 --> 00:14:05.470
was, of course, related
to the vector potential.

00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:08.290
And the vector potential, which
is a normal mode expansion.

00:14:08.290 --> 00:14:10.250
And then we put
everything backward.

00:14:10.250 --> 00:14:13.820
And we found that the electric
field operator can actually

00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:14.780
be written.

00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:17.450
Have to fill in a few
things, but essentially,

00:14:17.450 --> 00:14:21.990
it's a minus a dagger.

00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:26.580
And a minus a dagger
is nothing else

00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:30.940
than the momentum of
the harmonic oscillator.

00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:33.620
So here, the momentum
has a special role,

00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:37.570
because it is the operator
of the electric field.

00:14:37.570 --> 00:14:39.900
If you have light
in a single mode,

00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:42.420
it has a harmonic
oscillator representation.

00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:45.360
And the operator for
the electric field

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:48.110
is-- I put in a few bells
and whistles in a moment--

00:14:48.110 --> 00:14:51.050
but is in essence
the momentum operator

00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:53.590
of the mechanical and
analogous harmonic oscillator.

00:14:57.350 --> 00:15:02.560
OK but the electric
field has a polarization.

00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:03.810
We need that.

00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:16.590
We have the photon energy
and the quantization volume.

00:15:16.590 --> 00:15:20.300
So what I'm writing
down here is actually

00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:23.460
the electric field,
this square root,

00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:26.370
is the electric field
strings of a single photon

00:15:26.370 --> 00:15:30.600
in the quantized
volume of our cavity.

00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:32.820
So v is the quantization volume.

00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:45.200
Then if you have a single mode
of the electromagnetic field,

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:50.030
well, in contrast to
a harmonic oscillator,

00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:55.780
we have a prorogation
kr plus omega t.

00:15:55.780 --> 00:15:58.440
And here we have
e to the minus i.

00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:02.460
I hope I get the
signs wrong here.

00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:03.720
Minus omega t.

00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:09.760
But, OK, we will
mainly be looking

00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:11.390
at an atom at the origin.

00:16:11.390 --> 00:16:13.960
That's what we did in
the dipole approximation.

00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:17.630
So when I said that the electric
field operator corresponds

00:16:17.630 --> 00:16:24.000
to the momentum, I have to add
now that it is at t equals 0

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.070
and at r equals 0.

00:16:30.010 --> 00:16:34.410
We'll come back to
that in a few moments.

00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:38.270
OK, since I've given
you the operator--

00:16:38.270 --> 00:16:42.150
let me just put the
operator symbol on it--

00:16:42.150 --> 00:16:45.010
the operator of
the electric field,

00:16:45.010 --> 00:16:49.740
I have to say now one word
about Heisenberg operators

00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:52.020
versus Schrodinger operators.

00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:54.200
I assume you're all
familiar with the two

00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:57.080
different representations
of quantum mechanics.

00:16:57.080 --> 00:16:59.660
We often use the
Schrodinger representation

00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:02.160
where the operators
are time independent.

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:04.750
But in the Heisenberg
representation,

00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:08.310
the wave function, the state
vector, is time independent.

00:17:08.310 --> 00:17:13.050
And the time dependence of the
evolution of the quantum system

00:17:13.050 --> 00:17:16.240
leads to a time dependence
of the operator.

00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:19.420
So what I've written
down for you here

00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:27.280
is actually the
Heisenberg operator,

00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:29.450
because it has a
time revolution.

00:17:29.450 --> 00:17:34.590
But for a single mode,
monochromatic electromagnetic

00:17:34.590 --> 00:17:37.820
field, the time evolution
is just e to the i omega t.

00:17:40.850 --> 00:17:49.600
So if you want to obtain
the Schrodinger operator,

00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:52.060
you have to eliminate
the time dependence

00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:55.560
by setting t equals 0.

00:17:55.560 --> 00:18:00.030
At t equals 0, by definition,
the Schrodinger operator

00:18:00.030 --> 00:18:03.230
and the Heisenberg
operator are the same.

00:18:03.230 --> 00:18:05.260
But then, in the
Schrodinger picture,

00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:08.270
the quantum state evolves
and the operator stays put.

00:18:08.270 --> 00:18:11.820
In the Heisenberg picture, the
quantum state stays constant

00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:14.230
and the operator evolves.

00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:17.520
So I'm usually
writing down for you

00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:19.330
expressions for
Heisenberg operators.

00:18:19.330 --> 00:18:22.677
And if you simply set t
equals 0 in this expression,

00:18:22.677 --> 00:18:24.093
you have the
Schrodinger operator.

00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:30.170
Questions?

00:18:30.170 --> 00:18:30.710
Yes.

00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:33.043
AUDIENCE: What happens when
there's a factor of two that

00:18:33.043 --> 00:18:35.395
shows up in the electric
field of a single photon,

00:18:35.395 --> 00:18:36.880
like the [INAUDIBLE]?

00:18:39.850 --> 00:18:42.572
I thought it was
like-- [INAUDIBLE] it's

00:18:42.572 --> 00:18:44.320
just a factor of
two [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:47.070
PROFESSOR: Yes, you have to be
careful with factors of two.

00:18:47.070 --> 00:18:48.242
I think I got it right here.

00:18:48.242 --> 00:18:49.575
There is no extra factor of two.

00:18:53.670 --> 00:18:58.410
But the question is, OK,
whenever you write down

00:18:58.410 --> 00:19:00.330
equations for the
electric field,

00:19:00.330 --> 00:19:05.020
you want to sort of use a
and a daggers photon number,

00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:08.560
or create photon numbers,
so they are dimensionless.

00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:11.820
So you always need
a prefactor, which

00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:14.390
has a dimension of
the electric field.

00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:20.110
And for the quantisation of
light, you have two choices.

00:19:20.110 --> 00:19:23.400
One is I can take the
electric field associated

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:24.890
with the single photon.

00:19:24.890 --> 00:19:26.160
That's one option.

00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:29.440
The other option is
I take as a prefactor

00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:34.990
the electric field in the
ground state, which you can say

00:19:34.990 --> 00:19:37.750
is the zero point fluctuations
of the electric field

00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:39.960
and the two differ
by a factor of two,

00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:43.320
because the energy
of the vacuum field

00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:47.130
is 1/2 h bar omega, whereas 1
[INAUDIBLE] equals h bar omega.

00:19:47.130 --> 00:19:51.395
So that's one reason why you may
sometimes find factors of two

00:19:51.395 --> 00:19:54.190
in some textbooks
or not in others.

00:19:54.190 --> 00:19:56.417
But I think-- I checked.

00:19:56.417 --> 00:19:58.250
I think, as far as I
know, it is consistent.

00:19:58.250 --> 00:20:01.238
AUDIENCE: So these operators
you've written down for e,

00:20:01.238 --> 00:20:04.420
this is the Heisenberg operator
with the time frames right now?

00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:06.170
PROFESSOR: This is the
Heisenberg operator

00:20:06.170 --> 00:20:08.580
for the electric field.

00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:09.520
But it differs.

00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:14.710
I mean, at that point, don't--
there's nothing really to worry

00:20:14.710 --> 00:20:16.440
about or get concerned about.

00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:18.245
The question is, for
monochromatic light,

00:20:18.245 --> 00:20:22.550
do we put the e to the i omega t
into the state or the operator?

00:20:22.550 --> 00:20:24.550
It's really just
an e to the i omega

00:20:24.550 --> 00:20:29.617
t factor has to be put either on
this state or on the operator.

00:20:29.617 --> 00:20:30.700
These are the two choices.

00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:40.910
Actually, my advice
to you is don't even

00:20:40.910 --> 00:20:43.880
develop an intuitive
conceptual understanding.

00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:45.520
And whether you are
in the Schrodinger,

00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:48.490
try to sort of see the
structure of the operator.

00:20:48.490 --> 00:20:51.190
I sometimes like the omega
t, because it shows you

00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:53.070
how the electric field evolves.

00:20:53.070 --> 00:20:54.690
And you see that explicitly.

00:20:54.690 --> 00:20:58.290
But in the end, it's only
when you do real calculation

00:20:58.290 --> 00:21:01.370
that you have to think hard, OK,
which picture am I using now?

00:21:01.370 --> 00:21:03.790
Which representation
am I using now?

00:21:03.790 --> 00:21:06.262
I'm probably not 100%
rigorous in this course

00:21:06.262 --> 00:21:08.720
when I write down quantum states
and operators, whether I'm

00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:10.410
always in the
Schrodinger picture

00:21:10.410 --> 00:21:12.070
or in the Heisenberg picture.

00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:14.800
But by simply looking, does
it have a time dependence?

00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:15.300
Yes.

00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:16.760
It's a Heisenberg picture.

00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:21.030
If I write down a quantum state,
which has a time dependence,

00:21:21.030 --> 00:21:24.160
then I've chosen the
Schrodinger representation.

00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:27.000
It's as easy as that.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:27.674
There was other?

00:21:27.674 --> 00:21:28.173
Yeah.

00:21:28.173 --> 00:21:29.839
AUDIENCE: There's a
sign wrong up there,

00:21:29.839 --> 00:21:34.054
because both a and a dagger
goes into the i omega

00:21:34.054 --> 00:21:35.548
t as you have written down.

00:21:35.548 --> 00:21:39.895
So they should be kind
of rotating right.

00:21:39.895 --> 00:21:41.145
PROFESSOR: Give me one second.

00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:17.070
Actually, I just wanted to say
I was careful with my notes,

00:22:17.070 --> 00:22:19.417
but I didn't carefully
look at my notes.

00:22:19.417 --> 00:22:20.750
This is what I have in my notes.

00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:21.710
Does that satisfy you?

00:22:21.710 --> 00:22:22.501
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:22:22.501 --> 00:22:23.334
PROFESSOR: OK, good.

00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:34.365
OK so we want to talk about
quantum states of light.

00:22:37.650 --> 00:22:42.110
The simplest eigenstates
are, of course,

00:22:42.110 --> 00:22:45.910
the harmonic
oscillator eigenstates.

00:22:45.910 --> 00:22:49.050
But, as I've already
mentioned, and we'll

00:22:49.050 --> 00:22:52.380
elaborate on it further,
these are actually

00:22:52.380 --> 00:22:54.030
non-classical states.

00:22:54.030 --> 00:22:55.970
So quite often, we
don't want those states.

00:22:55.970 --> 00:22:57.960
We want coherent states.

00:22:57.960 --> 00:23:05.840
But we need those number states
said as one representation.

00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:07.740
So let me just introduce them.

00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:20.410
So we'll label by n the
states with n photons.

00:23:23.190 --> 00:23:29.855
And the energy of those states
is n plus 1/2 h bar omega.

00:23:33.167 --> 00:23:34.250
The states are normalized.

00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:42.370
Sometimes, out of laziness,
because it doesn't matter,

00:23:42.370 --> 00:23:45.240
we can eliminate the 1/2.

00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:49.020
It just makes some
equations more compact.

00:23:49.020 --> 00:24:11.700
And if I do that, I can write
the Hamiltonian like this.

00:24:15.250 --> 00:24:18.820
You are familiar, of
course, with commutators

00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:20.680
of a and a daggers.

00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:26.170
And the only non-trivial matrix
element of a and a dagger

00:24:26.170 --> 00:24:33.880
that it raises and lowers
the photon number by one.

00:24:37.330 --> 00:24:42.490
OK, this was a short review of
the simple harmonic oscillator

00:24:42.490 --> 00:24:49.320
as it applies to a single mode
of the electromagnetic field.

00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:56.590
Now, just as a short
example, in subsection two,

00:24:56.590 --> 00:24:59.490
we want to discuss
the thermal state.

00:24:59.490 --> 00:25:01.530
And the thermal
state is nothing else

00:25:01.530 --> 00:25:04.960
than photons in a
black body cavity.

00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:08.770
We have a photon field,
which is in equilibrium

00:25:08.770 --> 00:25:10.290
at temperature t.

00:25:16.630 --> 00:25:22.390
So if you use the
canonical ensemble,

00:25:22.390 --> 00:25:26.120
our statistical
operator is given

00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:30.610
by this well known expression.

00:25:30.610 --> 00:25:34.317
And if I use-- I
mean that's all.

00:25:34.317 --> 00:25:35.900
I mean, isn't it
wonderful once you're

00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:38.010
trained in
statistical mechanics?

00:25:38.010 --> 00:25:40.740
This is all you have to know
about a thermal state of light?

00:25:40.740 --> 00:25:42.200
That's it.

00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:44.370
This is the Planck Law.

00:25:44.370 --> 00:25:48.299
All we have to do is
take the Hamiltonian,

00:25:48.299 --> 00:25:49.840
which we have written
down, upstairs.

00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:56.810
So this is e to the
minus n photons.

00:25:56.810 --> 00:26:01.420
n times h bar omega
is the energy over kt

00:26:01.420 --> 00:26:03.130
divided by the
partition function.

00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:12.000
This is the density matrix,
a statistical operator

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:14.635
for single mode light
at thermal equilibrium.

00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:24.230
The partition function
is very simple,

00:26:24.230 --> 00:26:32.390
because this sum over
Boltzmann factors this

00:26:32.390 --> 00:26:36.340
is a geometric series,
which can be simply

00:26:36.340 --> 00:26:44.830
summed up in this
way-- divided by kt.

00:26:44.830 --> 00:26:56.870
So therefore, this
expression here

00:26:56.870 --> 00:27:08.420
can be written as-- the density
matrix in thermal equilibrium

00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:11.560
can be written in
the number bases.

00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:14.260
And it's diagonal.

00:27:14.260 --> 00:27:17.910
And the prefactor
is the probability

00:27:17.910 --> 00:27:21.520
to have n photons populated
in thermal equilibrium.

00:27:26.130 --> 00:27:33.590
And the probability for
n photons is given here.

00:27:33.590 --> 00:27:36.610
We've evaluated the
partition function.

00:27:36.610 --> 00:27:39.140
So then if you put it
together, we simply

00:27:39.140 --> 00:27:44.750
get this-- you can call it
Boltz-Einesten factor, which

00:27:44.750 --> 00:27:48.730
tells us what is the
probability to find

00:27:48.730 --> 00:27:52.930
an harmonic oscillator
with n [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:52.930 --> 00:27:57.415
And this is the expression--
e to the minus h bar omega.

00:28:00.550 --> 00:28:14.910
So this result takes
care of many situations--

00:28:14.910 --> 00:28:17.200
actually, almost
all situations--

00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:20.350
you find in every
day life unless you

00:28:20.350 --> 00:28:22.350
switch on a laser pointer.

00:28:22.350 --> 00:28:31.260
So this describes--
and resistive filament.

00:28:37.570 --> 00:28:40.545
It describes the light
generated by gas discharges.

00:28:44.610 --> 00:28:48.980
It describes the
light of the sun.

00:28:48.980 --> 00:28:55.010
And this kind of thermal
light, because it

00:28:55.010 --> 00:28:59.800
has the-- I mean, light
in thermal equilibrium

00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:05.350
maximizing the entropy under
the given boundary condition,

00:29:05.350 --> 00:29:07.080
it's also called chaotic light.

00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:13.470
It's just another name
for thermal light.

00:29:18.650 --> 00:29:24.120
Well, we should now lean
back and take the attitude,

00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:27.310
if I know the statistical
operator of an ensemble,

00:29:27.310 --> 00:29:29.800
I know everything about it.

00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:32.600
And every quantity
I'm interested in

00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:35.420
can be calculated.

00:29:35.420 --> 00:29:40.520
So just as an
example, we know what

00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:42.760
is a probability
to find n photons.

00:29:46.730 --> 00:29:51.570
But now we want to ask
what is the energy density,

00:29:51.570 --> 00:29:55.990
or what is the mean
excitation number.

00:29:55.990 --> 00:30:00.010
What is the average of n?

00:30:00.010 --> 00:30:05.630
So for that, we have to take
the number operator, a dagger a,

00:30:05.630 --> 00:30:08.250
and perform the trace
with the product

00:30:08.250 --> 00:30:10.730
of the statistical operator.

00:30:10.730 --> 00:30:14.710
And this is, of course,
nothing else when

00:30:14.710 --> 00:30:17.920
we look for the probability
to find n photons.

00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:22.960
And this probability
is weighted with n.

00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:27.235
And what we get is the
very simple result.

00:30:30.700 --> 00:30:32.700
It's a Bose-Einstein
distribution law

00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:35.720
with a chemical
potential of 0, which

00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:37.610
is the familiar distribution.

00:30:43.300 --> 00:30:52.530
We can now use the quantity n to
rewrite our previous expression

00:30:52.530 --> 00:31:00.300
for the probability to find n
photons in thermal equilibrium.

00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:04.310
It is n bar to the
power n divided

00:31:04.310 --> 00:31:09.470
by 1 over n bar times n plus 1.

00:31:09.470 --> 00:31:12.450
So all this should be
very familiar to you.

00:31:12.450 --> 00:31:16.020
And I'm not doing
the final step,

00:31:16.020 --> 00:31:23.080
but I could immediately
get Planck's Law now.

00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:26.550
All I have to use it sum up now.

00:31:26.550 --> 00:31:29.500
This is a single mode of light,
single monochromatic light.

00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:31.900
All I have to do is
to get Planck's law is

00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:35.470
to sum overall modes using
the density of modes.

00:31:47.844 --> 00:31:48.385
Any question?

00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:57.040
We will not be talking
a lot in this course

00:31:57.040 --> 00:32:01.870
about chaotic and
thermal light, because we

00:32:01.870 --> 00:32:05.450
are mainly interested
in the purer form

00:32:05.450 --> 00:32:07.340
how atom interacts with light.

00:32:07.340 --> 00:32:11.080
And this will be when light
is in a more specific state,

00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:14.200
not in a thermal ensemble,
in a more specific state

00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:16.850
which are number states
or coherent states.

00:32:16.850 --> 00:32:19.810
But nevertheless, I
feel if I don't tell you

00:32:19.810 --> 00:32:21.950
a little bit about
ordinary light,

00:32:21.950 --> 00:32:25.610
you will not be able to
appreciate quantum light.

00:32:25.610 --> 00:32:28.540
So I want to use this example
now of a thermal distribution

00:32:28.540 --> 00:32:33.500
of light and write down for
you in the next 90 seconds

00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:35.630
expressions for
the fluctuations.

00:32:35.630 --> 00:32:37.380
So you should know a
little bit about what

00:32:37.380 --> 00:32:40.260
is the statistic
of thermal light.

00:32:40.260 --> 00:32:46.569
If you find n photons in a
black cavity and you look again,

00:32:46.569 --> 00:32:49.110
it's the standard deviation of
the photon number square root.

00:32:49.110 --> 00:32:51.500
And is it Poissonian,
or is it much larger?

00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:54.700
So you should know about
that, because it will then

00:32:54.700 --> 00:32:57.550
make a difference when
we talk about the purer

00:32:57.550 --> 00:33:01.190
states of light, coherent
states, and number

00:33:01.190 --> 00:33:02.800
states, squeeze
states, and all that.

00:33:06.550 --> 00:33:11.750
OK, so we want to look
now at fluctuations.

00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:16.496
Let me just first mention that
we have normalized correctly

00:33:16.496 --> 00:33:17.246
the probabilities.

00:33:24.830 --> 00:33:26.660
Just one second.

00:33:26.660 --> 00:33:30.440
What we are interested
now is the fluctuations.

00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:33.350
So we want to know the variance.

00:33:33.350 --> 00:33:39.100
We want to know what
is delta n squared.

00:33:39.100 --> 00:33:42.860
And delta n squared
is of course n

00:33:42.860 --> 00:33:46.155
square average minus
n average squared.

00:33:49.170 --> 00:33:56.205
And we want to find out what
is that for thermal light,

00:33:56.205 --> 00:33:58.300
for chaotic light.

00:33:58.300 --> 00:34:02.050
So what we need now is
we need an expression.

00:34:02.050 --> 00:34:06.370
We have already an expression
up there for n average.

00:34:06.370 --> 00:34:08.680
And now we need an expression
for n square average.

00:34:17.500 --> 00:34:26.540
We can get that as follows.

00:34:26.540 --> 00:34:45.719
If we take the probability,
multiply it with n-- n minus 1.

00:34:45.719 --> 00:34:46.640
Sum over.

00:34:57.330 --> 00:34:58.330
So I have a brain cramp.

00:34:58.330 --> 00:35:02.640
This equation is in my notes,
but I don't-- maybe step back--

00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:04.660
I don't see where it comes from.

00:35:04.660 --> 00:35:06.160
But from this
expression, of course,

00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:09.020
we have now an expression
for n average squared.

00:35:11.970 --> 00:35:18.890
n squared-- the sum over it.

00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:30.440
Just a second.

00:35:37.699 --> 00:35:54.954
n average-- n thermal--
n average squared.

00:35:57.912 --> 00:36:00.399
Anyway, I don't want
to waste class time.

00:36:00.399 --> 00:36:02.190
It made sense to me
when I wrote the notes.

00:36:02.190 --> 00:36:05.360
I just can't reproduce
the argument.

00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:08.630
So this should be obvious.

00:36:08.630 --> 00:36:10.640
It's not obvious
to me right now.

00:36:10.640 --> 00:36:12.640
But let's just take
it and run with it.

00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:19.240
The left hand side
is n square minus n

00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:21.220
multiplied with the probability.

00:36:30.860 --> 00:36:32.110
So let me just take a note.

00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:38.370
I will show you where
it comes from on Monday.

00:36:38.370 --> 00:36:41.352
But assuming that
it's true, and I

00:36:41.352 --> 00:36:47.960
know it is true, that
actually contains

00:36:47.960 --> 00:37:04.525
n square average minus n
average is 2n average squared.

00:37:11.460 --> 00:37:15.200
So therefore, we have
now our expression

00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:19.120
for the average
of n square, which

00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:27.360
is 2n average squared
plus n average.

00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:39.860
And therefore, for thermal
light, for chaotic light,

00:37:39.860 --> 00:37:48.210
the variance, delta n
square, is n average square

00:37:48.210 --> 00:37:49.510
plus n average.

00:37:52.740 --> 00:37:59.810
So the question is if
this is our variance--

00:37:59.810 --> 00:38:05.680
the variance of thermal light,
of chaotic light, is that.

00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:07.700
What you should
see immediately is

00:38:07.700 --> 00:38:11.590
that it is much more fluctuating
then Poissonian statistics.

00:38:17.110 --> 00:38:28.800
Well, if you compare now
with Poissonian statistics,

00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:36.050
Poissonian statistics
would have fluctuations

00:38:36.050 --> 00:38:41.840
where, well, the RMS
fluctuations are square root n.

00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:43.540
The variance is just n average.

00:38:46.550 --> 00:38:50.670
So thermal light is
super Poissonian,

00:38:50.670 --> 00:38:55.209
has much, much stronger
fluctuations than Poissonian

00:38:55.209 --> 00:38:55.750
distribution.

00:39:02.360 --> 00:39:06.140
OK, one question for you.

00:39:06.140 --> 00:39:10.435
If you look at the distribution
of photons-- and we

00:39:10.435 --> 00:39:13.390
have written it down here.

00:39:13.390 --> 00:39:14.400
Let me just scroll up.

00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:22.150
Well, you probably don't
have an auto-plot function

00:39:22.150 --> 00:39:23.150
in your brain.

00:39:23.150 --> 00:39:26.890
But if you plot this
function, and I'm

00:39:26.890 --> 00:39:31.720
asking you what is the
most probable photon number

00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:34.510
you will find for light
in thermal equilibrium?

00:39:39.210 --> 00:39:40.150
AUDIENCE: Zero.

00:39:40.150 --> 00:39:42.850
PROFESSOR: Zero.

00:39:42.850 --> 00:39:45.880
It is a broad Gaussian
centered at zero.

00:39:45.880 --> 00:39:47.840
So you have a broad Gaussian.

00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:49.810
The average photon
number is related

00:39:49.810 --> 00:39:52.130
to the width of the Gaussian.

00:39:52.130 --> 00:39:55.590
But the nature of
thermal light is

00:39:55.590 --> 00:39:59.080
that whenever you look
into a black body cavity

00:39:59.080 --> 00:40:03.970
and ask, what is the
most probable photon

00:40:03.970 --> 00:40:08.260
number for any mode,
it is actually zero.

00:40:08.260 --> 00:40:11.410
No matter how hot the
cavity is and how many

00:40:11.410 --> 00:40:14.650
photons you have in it, the
photon number distribution

00:40:14.650 --> 00:40:21.800
is always a broad Gaussian
with a maximum at zero.

00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:23.790
We'll come back
to that later When

00:40:23.790 --> 00:40:25.860
we talk about coherent states.

00:40:25.860 --> 00:40:27.920
Then you will appreciate
the difference.

00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:31.219
But I will be referring back
to the result we have just

00:40:31.219 --> 00:40:33.010
derived for the photon
number distribution.

00:40:38.810 --> 00:40:40.030
Let me just take a note.

00:40:42.770 --> 00:40:48.800
The most probably
n is n equals 0.

00:40:53.900 --> 00:41:04.790
OK, I hope with that-- and this
is III, the third subsection--

00:41:04.790 --> 00:41:13.355
you can really appreciate the
properties of coherent states.

00:41:18.130 --> 00:41:26.820
Coherent states were introduced
by Roy Glauber in 1963.

00:41:26.820 --> 00:41:30.530
It's actually something
you should wonder about.

00:41:30.530 --> 00:41:32.730
Coherent states seem so natural.

00:41:32.730 --> 00:41:34.620
I mean, we teach
it in all courses.

00:41:34.620 --> 00:41:37.490
And when we think about
harmonic oscillator,

00:41:37.490 --> 00:41:40.510
we often think in terms
of coherent states.

00:41:40.510 --> 00:41:43.560
But they were not
immediately used

00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:45.900
and invented when
quantum mechanics

00:41:45.900 --> 00:41:47.710
was invented in the '30s.

00:41:47.710 --> 00:41:50.330
It really took somebody
like Roy Glauber

00:41:50.330 --> 00:41:51.890
to invent coherent states.

00:41:51.890 --> 00:41:53.340
And that happened in the '60s.

00:41:58.320 --> 00:42:00.490
Maybe the reason why
people didn't immediately

00:42:00.490 --> 00:42:04.090
jump at coherent states is
because coherent states are not

00:42:04.090 --> 00:42:07.460
eigenstates of an Hamiltonian.

00:42:07.460 --> 00:42:09.340
The definition of
a coherent state

00:42:09.340 --> 00:42:17.250
is actually an eigenstate,
not of an Hamiltonian.

00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:24.250
It's an eigenstate of the
annihilation operator.

00:42:30.334 --> 00:42:32.750
And of course, the annihilation
operator is non-Hermitian.

00:42:32.750 --> 00:42:37.530
So it's a strange operator
to look for eigenstates.

00:42:37.530 --> 00:42:40.800
But this is what defines
the coherent state,

00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:46.650
namely that e acting on
a coherent state alpha

00:42:46.650 --> 00:42:48.970
equals alpha times alpha.

00:42:51.730 --> 00:42:54.590
I'm using here the
standard notation

00:42:54.590 --> 00:43:00.300
that alpha is both the
label for the coherent state

00:43:00.300 --> 00:43:03.560
written down here, and
is also the eigenvalue

00:43:03.560 --> 00:43:05.960
of the coherent
state when acted upon

00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:07.890
with the annihilation operator.

00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:17.140
We normalize those states.

00:43:17.140 --> 00:43:20.690
And since we're talking
about eigenvalues

00:43:20.690 --> 00:43:24.090
of a non-Hermitian
operator, alpha

00:43:24.090 --> 00:43:25.760
can be any complex number.

00:43:37.380 --> 00:43:43.340
OK, so now we have introduced
a second set of basis functions

00:43:43.340 --> 00:43:44.390
for light.

00:43:44.390 --> 00:43:48.170
Remember, we had the basis
functions n, the eigenfunctions

00:43:48.170 --> 00:43:50.340
of the harmonic
oscillator, and now we've

00:43:50.340 --> 00:43:52.927
defined a new set
of eigenfunctions,

00:43:52.927 --> 00:43:54.010
the coherent state alphas.

00:43:56.720 --> 00:43:58.770
Of course, the next
obvious question

00:43:58.770 --> 00:44:01.265
is how are the two
representations connected?

00:44:04.540 --> 00:44:08.490
So what we want to do now
is we want to figure out

00:44:08.490 --> 00:44:13.880
how do we write a coherent
state alpha in the n basis

00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:16.640
in the basis of eigenfunctions
of the harmonic oscillator?

00:44:20.900 --> 00:44:24.470
So we want to write--
this is just--

00:44:24.470 --> 00:44:31.000
want to expand the coherent
state into eigenfunctions n.

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:33.480
So the coefficients
we want to calculate

00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:38.630
are those matrix elements
which are defined as cn.

00:44:46.190 --> 00:44:48.410
So what we have
to use is in order

00:44:48.410 --> 00:44:50.500
to find this
representation, we have

00:44:50.500 --> 00:45:00.600
to use the fact that alpha is an
eigenstate of the annihilation

00:45:00.600 --> 00:45:02.000
operator.

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:06.180
So we know that this
is alpha times alpha.

00:45:06.180 --> 00:45:14.190
But we can also let the
annihilation operator a,

00:45:14.190 --> 00:45:18.920
we can let the annihilation
operator a act on this state

00:45:18.920 --> 00:45:21.980
and in this sum.

00:45:21.980 --> 00:45:26.740
And the annihilation
operator, of course,

00:45:26.740 --> 00:45:29.630
does what it is supposed to do.

00:45:29.630 --> 00:45:31.695
It lowers the photon
number by one.

00:45:36.230 --> 00:45:39.130
And we get the matrix
element square root n.

00:45:41.770 --> 00:45:48.530
And then by just changing
the summation index by one,

00:45:48.530 --> 00:45:54.440
we can write it as n times cn
plus 1 times the square root

00:45:54.440 --> 00:45:57.250
of n plus 1.

00:45:57.250 --> 00:46:00.319
So this is when the annihilation
operator acts on the sum.

00:46:00.319 --> 00:46:01.860
And now, I'll continue
with the lower

00:46:01.860 --> 00:46:10.060
line, which is alpha cn times n.

00:46:10.060 --> 00:46:13.070
So what I've found now
is I've found two ways

00:46:13.070 --> 00:46:17.550
to hide the same state,
namely a acting on alpha.

00:46:17.550 --> 00:46:21.240
And therefore,
those coefficients

00:46:21.240 --> 00:46:22.530
have to be the same.

00:46:25.930 --> 00:46:28.360
And what I just
indicated in blue

00:46:28.360 --> 00:46:38.765
is a recursion relation, which
expresses cn plus 1 by cn.

00:46:46.940 --> 00:46:54.140
So every time you go
from cn to cn plus 1,

00:46:54.140 --> 00:46:57.363
you multiply with the
square root of n plus 1.

00:47:01.310 --> 00:47:05.300
So if you stare at
it for a moment,

00:47:05.300 --> 00:47:09.010
you find that cn
is related to c0.

00:47:21.990 --> 00:47:41.040
Yes, cn plus 1 by alpha
n over n factorial.

00:47:41.040 --> 00:47:42.830
So of course, we get
only the relation

00:47:42.830 --> 00:47:44.450
between the coefficients.

00:47:44.450 --> 00:47:52.560
But if you throw in that we
want to normalize the state,

00:47:52.560 --> 00:47:55.880
this determines c0.

00:47:55.880 --> 00:48:00.470
And then, we get
as a final result

00:48:00.470 --> 00:48:06.490
the normalized representation
of the coherent state

00:48:06.490 --> 00:48:07.790
in terms of number states.

00:48:19.110 --> 00:48:22.800
Excuse me, I think the
square root is missing here,

00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:26.600
because it appears here times n.

00:48:31.020 --> 00:48:37.370
OK, so what we have
found here is now

00:48:37.370 --> 00:48:42.910
how coherent states are written
down in the number state basis.

00:48:53.080 --> 00:48:56.120
So now we know coherent states.

00:48:56.120 --> 00:48:58.500
And we can ask a
number of questions.

00:48:58.500 --> 00:49:03.640
So what is this?

00:49:03.640 --> 00:49:05.320
So what did we define?

00:49:05.320 --> 00:49:07.644
And what have we now derived?

00:49:07.644 --> 00:49:09.185
Let's look at some
of the properties.

00:49:12.340 --> 00:49:18.150
The first one is that if
you look at this expression,

00:49:18.150 --> 00:49:21.550
this is the amplitude
that will have

00:49:21.550 --> 00:49:25.410
n photons in a coherent state.

00:49:25.410 --> 00:49:27.560
The square of the amplitude
is the probability.

00:49:30.150 --> 00:49:34.490
So the probability
to find n photons

00:49:34.490 --> 00:49:44.140
is the square of
the amplitude above.

00:49:46.660 --> 00:49:49.630
So this is that.

00:49:49.630 --> 00:49:51.870
And this is now a
Poissonian distribution.

00:49:59.290 --> 00:50:03.340
So it's immediately clear
that those coherent states

00:50:03.340 --> 00:50:06.220
have much, much smaller
fluctuations in the photon

00:50:06.220 --> 00:50:09.050
number than the thermal
state we discussed before.

00:50:09.050 --> 00:50:12.170
Because this is Poissonian,
whereas the thermal state

00:50:12.170 --> 00:50:14.630
had a variance which was much,
much larger than Poissonian.

00:50:19.080 --> 00:50:22.160
OK, that's number one.

00:50:22.160 --> 00:50:30.110
Number two is we would like to
know what is the photon number.

00:50:30.110 --> 00:50:33.900
So we want to know what is
the expectation value for n.

00:50:36.410 --> 00:50:39.280
That's actually
very easy to find.

00:50:39.280 --> 00:50:43.460
You could, of course, get
the average number of photons

00:50:43.460 --> 00:50:49.520
in by evaluating the expansion
of the coherent state in terms

00:50:49.520 --> 00:50:51.670
of number states.

00:50:51.670 --> 00:50:55.190
But sometimes, you should also
try to maybe directly evaluate

00:50:55.190 --> 00:50:56.650
the coherent state.

00:50:56.650 --> 00:51:01.166
And the photon number
operator is a dagger a.

00:51:01.166 --> 00:51:03.260
And now you see
here we are lucky,

00:51:03.260 --> 00:51:07.400
because a acting on alpha
is just getting alpha.

00:51:07.400 --> 00:51:10.760
But a dagger acting on
alpha on the left hand side

00:51:10.760 --> 00:51:14.990
gives us alpha star,
the complex conjugate.

00:51:14.990 --> 00:51:18.010
So what we obtain here is
simply the absolute value

00:51:18.010 --> 00:51:19.490
of alpha square.

00:51:19.490 --> 00:51:22.360
And this is our expression
for the average photon number.

00:51:35.500 --> 00:51:39.060
I have already mentioned
that the variance must

00:51:39.060 --> 00:51:44.220
be-- the variance must be
n, because it's a Poissonian

00:51:44.220 --> 00:51:45.830
distribution.

00:51:45.830 --> 00:51:51.400
But since it is so nice to
have creation annihilation

00:51:51.400 --> 00:51:54.290
operators acting
on coherent states,

00:51:54.290 --> 00:51:57.390
let's just calculate--
let's verify

00:51:57.390 --> 00:52:00.220
that this distribution--
we know that distribution

00:52:00.220 --> 00:52:02.870
is Poissonian, but
let's verify directly

00:52:02.870 --> 00:52:06.330
that the variance of the photon
number in the coherent state

00:52:06.330 --> 00:52:08.660
is n, is Poissonian.

00:52:08.660 --> 00:52:11.950
If you need the variance,
we need an average.

00:52:11.950 --> 00:52:13.760
And we need n square average.

00:52:13.760 --> 00:52:15.670
Let's just calculate
n square average.

00:52:21.080 --> 00:52:24.120
So we need now the
operator for n square,

00:52:24.120 --> 00:52:28.630
which is a dagger a, a dagger a.

00:52:28.630 --> 00:52:31.580
We know already if
those two operators

00:52:31.580 --> 00:52:37.350
act on the [INAUDIBLE],
that this just

00:52:37.350 --> 00:52:40.630
gives us alpha star alpha.

00:52:43.500 --> 00:52:46.190
And then we are left
with a a dagger.

00:52:49.320 --> 00:52:51.530
Now, a dagger acts on alpha.

00:52:51.530 --> 00:52:54.410
We don't know what a
dagger is acting on alpha.

00:52:54.410 --> 00:52:57.945
We know that alpha is an
eigenstate of a, but not

00:52:57.945 --> 00:52:59.180
of a dagger.

00:52:59.180 --> 00:53:04.060
So therefore, we want to change
the order of a and a dagger,

00:53:04.060 --> 00:53:04.855
use a commutator.

00:53:08.600 --> 00:53:12.720
And then of course, a
dagger can act here.

00:53:12.720 --> 00:53:14.520
A can act here.

00:53:14.520 --> 00:53:17.820
And we just get another
factor of alpha.

00:53:17.820 --> 00:53:20.930
So therefore, in a very
straightforward way,

00:53:20.930 --> 00:53:23.880
we find now that
n square is alpha

00:53:23.880 --> 00:53:30.450
square times alpha
square plus 1.

00:53:30.450 --> 00:53:33.650
And using the result for
the mean photon number,

00:53:33.650 --> 00:53:38.980
this is nothing else
than n bar, 1 plus n bar.

00:53:47.430 --> 00:53:52.400
So if we now put it together,
we want to know the variance.

00:53:52.400 --> 00:53:55.370
The variance is n square
average, which we've just

00:53:55.370 --> 00:53:59.000
calculated, minus
n average squared.

00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:03.130
And hooray, we find n bar.

00:54:03.130 --> 00:54:09.910
And we verify again that the
fluctuations are Poissonian.

00:54:21.360 --> 00:54:24.350
What else can we ask?

00:54:24.350 --> 00:54:28.580
We've asked about the
statistics of fluctuation.

00:54:28.580 --> 00:54:31.900
We've asked about the
probability to find photons.

00:54:31.900 --> 00:54:33.900
Well, what else do you
want to know about light?

00:54:37.040 --> 00:54:37.940
Electric field.

00:54:41.740 --> 00:54:44.789
Oh, that's something
I forgot to ask.

00:54:44.789 --> 00:54:46.080
I will come back to that later.

00:54:46.080 --> 00:54:48.680
But just sort of
to connect it, what

00:54:48.680 --> 00:54:52.240
is the average electric
field for thermal light?

00:54:57.280 --> 00:54:58.556
Zero.

00:54:58.556 --> 00:55:01.140
And what else can it be?

00:55:01.140 --> 00:55:06.710
Because any value of
the electric field,

00:55:06.710 --> 00:55:09.830
whether the electric field
is positive or negative,

00:55:09.830 --> 00:55:15.190
requires that the--
I say it loosely--

00:55:15.190 --> 00:55:16.840
that the photon has a phase.

00:55:16.840 --> 00:55:20.310
The phase will define whether
it's positive or negative.

00:55:20.310 --> 00:55:25.060
But all different phases of the
photon field, all different--

00:55:25.060 --> 00:55:26.700
what I mean now is
coherent states,

00:55:26.700 --> 00:55:29.410
but have different phases--
they are all degenerate.

00:55:29.410 --> 00:55:35.870
So in a thermal ensemble,
the states are only

00:55:35.870 --> 00:55:38.150
populated due to
their energy, they're

00:55:38.150 --> 00:55:40.800
populated by Boltzmann factors.

00:55:40.800 --> 00:55:43.370
And therefore, there
is no distinction

00:55:43.370 --> 00:55:45.850
what the phase of the state are.

00:55:45.850 --> 00:55:49.990
So therefore, we haven't defined
yet what the phase of a photon

00:55:49.990 --> 00:55:53.630
is, so therefore I'm a little
bit guarded with my language.

00:55:53.630 --> 00:55:57.600
But in other words, whatever
the state with the phase

00:55:57.600 --> 00:56:01.960
is in a thermal ensemble, you
have all phases simultaneously.

00:56:01.960 --> 00:56:05.050
And therefore, you never have
an expectation value of e.

00:56:07.630 --> 00:56:11.860
But of course, we had an
average number of photons.

00:56:11.860 --> 00:56:14.940
And that means we have an
expectation value of e square,

00:56:14.940 --> 00:56:17.340
because the expectation
value of e square

00:56:17.340 --> 00:56:19.460
is the expectation
value of the energy.

00:56:19.460 --> 00:56:22.494
The state has energy.

00:56:22.494 --> 00:56:24.160
But it doesn't have
an expectation value

00:56:24.160 --> 00:56:27.130
for the electric field.

00:56:27.130 --> 00:56:30.050
OK, so maybe with
that motivation,

00:56:30.050 --> 00:56:33.770
we want to figure out now does
this coherent state, which

00:56:33.770 --> 00:56:37.520
we have constructed,
does that have now

00:56:37.520 --> 00:56:40.170
an expectation value
for the electric field?

00:56:52.730 --> 00:56:57.330
So there is one
thing you of course

00:56:57.330 --> 00:56:59.330
know about this electric field.

00:56:59.330 --> 00:57:01.760
Whenever we have
an electric field,

00:57:01.760 --> 00:57:03.655
it needs an amplitude
and a phase.

00:57:08.580 --> 00:57:12.300
And what I just mentioned to you
is that in a thermal ensemble,

00:57:12.300 --> 00:57:16.680
we were just looking at the
partition function and such.

00:57:16.680 --> 00:57:18.480
We didn't even mention a phase.

00:57:18.480 --> 00:57:22.300
There was not any complex
number in any of the equations

00:57:22.300 --> 00:57:24.000
we wrote down about
thermal light.

00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:28.180
No complex number, no phase,
means no electric field.

00:57:28.180 --> 00:57:32.100
But this is different now
for the coherent state.

00:57:32.100 --> 00:57:37.780
Because I mentioned that alpha
in general can be complex,

00:57:37.780 --> 00:57:42.130
the annihilation operator
can have complex eigenvalues.

00:57:42.130 --> 00:57:45.080
So therefore, in
the coherent state--

00:57:45.080 --> 00:57:48.610
because it is characterized
by a complex number--

00:57:48.610 --> 00:57:53.630
we have now the possibility
to include a phase.

00:57:56.980 --> 00:57:59.510
And what I want to show you
is, in the next few minutes,

00:57:59.510 --> 00:58:03.050
is that yes indeed,
the coherent state

00:58:03.050 --> 00:58:05.670
has an expectation value
of the electric field.

00:58:11.840 --> 00:58:16.750
Instead of simply using the
equation for the electric field

00:58:16.750 --> 00:58:20.620
operator-- remember electric
field operator was a minus

00:58:20.620 --> 00:58:28.140
a dagger-- I want to
introduce something else which

00:58:28.140 --> 00:58:30.320
will turn out to be
very, very useful.

00:58:30.320 --> 00:58:34.960
And one of the application
of this concept

00:58:34.960 --> 00:58:39.452
is to show you what
the electric field is.

00:58:39.452 --> 00:58:46.010
This is sort of a
visual representation,

00:58:46.010 --> 00:58:50.830
a visual representation
of the states

00:58:50.830 --> 00:58:54.080
of the electromagnetic field.

00:58:54.080 --> 00:58:58.340
So I want to sort of give you,
in a two dimensional diagram,

00:58:58.340 --> 00:59:03.010
a visual representation
of thermal states,

00:59:03.010 --> 00:59:05.330
coherent states, number states.

00:59:05.330 --> 00:59:07.050
And this visual
representation will

00:59:07.050 --> 00:59:11.830
make it immediately obvious
what the electric field is.

00:59:11.830 --> 00:59:19.220
So the visual
representation will

00:59:19.220 --> 00:59:21.730
represent what are called
quasi-probabilities.

00:59:27.830 --> 00:59:30.740
So I have to define for you
now those quasi-probabilities.

00:59:36.490 --> 00:59:44.710
So I denote the
quasi-probability by Q.

00:59:44.710 --> 00:59:49.090
And I want to know what
is the quasi-probability Q

00:59:49.090 --> 00:59:53.350
for any statistical operator
which describes a light.

00:59:53.350 --> 00:59:56.470
It could be the operator
for thermal light.

00:59:56.470 --> 01:00:01.050
It could be statistical operator
also includes, of course,

01:00:01.050 --> 01:00:01.850
pure states.

01:00:01.850 --> 01:00:04.050
And the pure state could
be a coherence state.

01:00:04.050 --> 01:00:07.710
So this is a way to define
our quasi-probabilities

01:00:07.710 --> 01:00:12.920
for any statistical operator
which is describing the light.

01:00:12.920 --> 01:00:19.030
And at the quasi-probabilities,
well, the probability for what?

01:00:19.030 --> 01:00:22.490
Well, the probabilities
for alpha.

01:00:22.490 --> 01:00:26.620
And alpha is related
to the coherent state.

01:00:26.620 --> 01:00:31.820
So in other words, we say
a statistical operator

01:00:31.820 --> 01:00:37.340
has a quasi-probability with a
coherent state alpha by simply

01:00:37.340 --> 01:00:40.360
calculating this
diagonal matrix element

01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:42.380
of the statistical
operator with alpha.

01:00:47.020 --> 01:00:51.630
Well, that's an abstract
definition, but it's exact.

01:00:51.630 --> 01:00:56.110
What we should now do is I
want to show you some examples.

01:00:56.110 --> 01:00:58.230
And then you will actually
see that it's actually

01:00:58.230 --> 01:00:59.188
a wonderful definition.

01:01:02.030 --> 01:01:06.310
So my first example
is let's look

01:01:06.310 --> 01:01:10.180
at the quasi-probability
for the vacuum state.

01:01:10.180 --> 01:01:14.160
So if the statistical
operator is simply

01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:16.580
the ground state of the
harmonic oscillator,

01:01:16.580 --> 01:01:18.755
no photon, no nothing,
just empty vacuum.

01:01:21.700 --> 01:01:27.970
So the quasi-probability
for the statistical operator

01:01:27.970 --> 01:01:30.300
is now a pure state.

01:01:30.300 --> 01:01:33.150
So I can say, what is a
quasi-probability of the vacuum

01:01:33.150 --> 01:01:35.270
state to be in state alpha?

01:01:38.410 --> 01:01:40.950
Well, following the
definition above,

01:01:40.950 --> 01:01:45.580
it's nothing else than the
matrix element, the overlap,

01:01:45.580 --> 01:01:48.210
between the vacuum and
the coherent state alpha.

01:01:52.560 --> 01:01:55.010
I've given you a path,
the representation

01:01:55.010 --> 01:01:59.730
of the coherent state alpha
in terms of number states.

01:01:59.730 --> 01:02:01.730
And all you have
to do is look now

01:02:01.730 --> 01:02:06.550
upstairs, what is the amplitude
that this representation

01:02:06.550 --> 01:02:07.900
includes a vacuum state.

01:02:07.900 --> 01:02:12.380
So it's just read
of the amplitude c0

01:02:12.380 --> 01:02:14.220
from the state above.

01:02:14.220 --> 01:02:20.290
And this was simply e to
the minus alpha squared.

01:02:20.290 --> 01:02:29.110
So therefore, if I--
those quasi-probabilities

01:02:29.110 --> 01:02:32.440
can be plotted in a
two dimensional plane,

01:02:32.440 --> 01:02:35.700
because it's a
function of alpha.

01:02:35.700 --> 01:02:40.730
So if I use the real part
of alpha, the imaginary part

01:02:40.730 --> 01:02:47.720
of alpha, now I can plot
the quasi-probability Q.

01:02:47.720 --> 01:02:55.130
And since it's hard for me to
do a 3-D plot on the tablet,

01:02:55.130 --> 01:02:57.550
I just sort of shade the region.

01:02:57.550 --> 01:02:59.917
Black means the
amplitude is large.

01:02:59.917 --> 01:03:01.000
And now it's sort of here.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:02.940
It means the
amplitude falls off.

01:03:02.940 --> 01:03:06.700
So what I'm plotting
here is a Gaussian,

01:03:06.700 --> 01:03:17.700
a Gaussian with the
widths of [INAUDIBLE]

01:03:17.700 --> 01:03:19.197
with the width of 1/2.

01:03:19.197 --> 01:03:21.280
I think in the standard
deviation of the Gaussian,

01:03:21.280 --> 01:03:23.179
you have a factor of 2.

01:03:23.179 --> 01:03:25.220
Anyway, it's on the order
of-- the Gaussian width

01:03:25.220 --> 01:03:26.190
on the order of
[INAUDIBLE] here,

01:03:26.190 --> 01:03:27.606
I think it's 1
over square root 2,

01:03:27.606 --> 01:03:30.416
or whatever the definition
of the standard deviation is.

01:03:30.416 --> 01:03:31.540
So here we have a Gaussian.

01:03:34.230 --> 01:03:34.870
Any question?

01:03:42.090 --> 01:03:45.530
So for pure state,
we're simply asking

01:03:45.530 --> 01:03:48.720
what is the amplitude
of the purse state

01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:50.782
to overlap to be in
a coherent state.

01:03:50.782 --> 01:03:52.240
And what we are
plotting is nothing

01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:56.990
else than the probability
that this state

01:03:56.990 --> 01:04:00.126
is a coherent state
with value alpha.

01:04:00.126 --> 01:04:01.212
You had a question?

01:04:01.212 --> 01:04:02.128
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:04:08.300 --> 01:04:13.070
PROFESSOR: The next
example, and we have already

01:04:13.070 --> 01:04:17.610
prepared for that,
is the thermal state.

01:04:17.610 --> 01:04:24.560
Example number two
is the thermal state.

01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:28.420
So we want to know what
is the quasi-probability

01:04:28.420 --> 01:04:33.480
for the thermal state
as a function of alpha.

01:04:38.880 --> 01:04:42.350
The statistical operator for the
thermal states, we had derived

01:04:42.350 --> 01:04:47.450
[INAUDIBLE] was the
probability to find n photons.

01:04:47.450 --> 01:04:50.120
And in the number
representation,

01:04:50.120 --> 01:04:54.050
the statistical
operator is diagonal.

01:04:54.050 --> 01:04:59.960
And then the quasi-probabilities
are nothing else,

01:04:59.960 --> 01:05:09.760
following the definition above,
then those probabilities times

01:05:09.760 --> 01:05:15.020
the matrix element, the
overlap between alpha and n.

01:05:15.020 --> 01:05:21.490
And if you look up what we had
derived for the probability pn,

01:05:21.490 --> 01:05:24.520
you find a very simple result.

01:05:24.520 --> 01:05:32.280
What we obtain is
again a Gaussian.

01:05:39.650 --> 01:05:46.200
It is also centered
at the origin.

01:05:46.200 --> 01:05:49.070
So therefore, since I
didn't label my axis,

01:05:49.070 --> 01:05:51.657
it looks exactly
as a vacuum state.

01:05:51.657 --> 01:05:53.740
It's just that the Gaussian
is much, much broader.

01:05:57.700 --> 01:06:08.560
And I will come to that,
but an intuitive reading

01:06:08.560 --> 01:06:11.280
of this Gaussian is,
well, this Gaussian

01:06:11.280 --> 01:06:13.680
has a peak at the origin.

01:06:13.680 --> 01:06:17.640
At the origin, this is
where alpha equals 0.

01:06:17.640 --> 01:06:20.210
And this is directly related
to the question I asked you

01:06:20.210 --> 01:06:25.520
before, that the photon
number probability is

01:06:25.520 --> 01:06:26.860
peaked at n equals 0.

01:06:30.030 --> 01:06:34.000
But I hope this will
become even clearer when

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:44.720
we move on to the third
example, which is now

01:06:44.720 --> 01:06:50.480
Q of alpha of a coherent state.

01:07:00.870 --> 01:07:04.200
Maybe just before I even
discuss the quasi-probability

01:07:04.200 --> 01:07:10.980
of a coherent state, I have
to address one thing up front.

01:07:10.980 --> 01:07:15.740
What would you expect
the quasi-probability

01:07:15.740 --> 01:07:18.891
of a coherent state to be?

01:07:18.891 --> 01:07:20.382
AUDIENCE: The
Gaussian [INAUDIBLE].

01:07:23.870 --> 01:07:24.930
PROFESSOR: Pretty good.

01:07:24.930 --> 01:07:29.800
But I said before,
the quasi-probability

01:07:29.800 --> 01:07:35.360
is-- let me just show
you how it was defined.

01:07:35.360 --> 01:07:38.110
Here was my definition
of the quasi-probability.

01:07:38.110 --> 01:07:41.140
And you can see the
quasi-probability

01:07:41.140 --> 01:07:47.550
is the diagram matrix element
of the statistical operator

01:07:47.550 --> 01:07:49.380
with a coherent state.

01:07:49.380 --> 01:07:55.180
But if our statistical operator
is a coherent state, what would

01:07:55.180 --> 01:07:57.120
you expect this
probability to be?

01:07:57.120 --> 01:07:58.170
Just naively.

01:07:58.170 --> 01:07:59.400
AUDIENCE: One.

01:07:59.400 --> 01:08:01.270
PROFESSOR: One or
a delta function.

01:08:01.270 --> 01:08:04.190
I mean, it's sort
of-- we ask, we

01:08:04.190 --> 01:08:08.320
ask-- if you expand this
statistical operator

01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:10.650
in coherent states,
what do we get?

01:08:10.650 --> 01:08:13.740
But if this operator
is a coherent state,

01:08:13.740 --> 01:08:16.479
let's say it's a coherent
state beta, you would expect,

01:08:16.479 --> 01:08:19.840
well, then we only get
something non-vanishing if alpha

01:08:19.840 --> 01:08:21.029
equals beta.

01:08:21.029 --> 01:08:23.670
So you would naively
expect that what you get

01:08:23.670 --> 01:08:25.210
is a delta function.

01:08:25.210 --> 01:08:28.710
The coherent state beta
has a quasi-probability Q

01:08:28.710 --> 01:08:31.180
of alpha, which
is peaked at beta.

01:08:31.180 --> 01:08:34.310
But it's peaked as
a delta function.

01:08:34.310 --> 01:08:37.100
Now, I'm calculating
it for you right now,

01:08:37.100 --> 01:08:40.620
and the result is
this is not the case.

01:08:40.620 --> 01:08:43.290
The reason is-- and
I will show that

01:08:43.290 --> 01:08:47.529
to you-- is that the
coherent states are not

01:08:47.529 --> 01:08:49.529
your ordinary basis function.

01:08:49.529 --> 01:08:54.220
The coherent state forms a
basis which is over complete.

01:08:54.220 --> 01:08:58.930
So we have sort of more
coherent states than necessary.

01:08:58.930 --> 01:09:00.540
There is some redundancy.

01:09:00.540 --> 01:09:03.260
And therefore, the
coherent state alpha

01:09:03.260 --> 01:09:08.185
and the coherent state
beta, if there's only

01:09:08.185 --> 01:09:11.620
a small difference between alpha
and beta, they have overlap.

01:09:11.620 --> 01:09:14.779
Coherent states which
differ by only a little bit

01:09:14.779 --> 01:09:20.160
in their eigenvalue,
they're not orthogonal.

01:09:20.160 --> 01:09:21.770
So this is a complication.

01:09:21.770 --> 01:09:23.750
It's one of the
complications we have

01:09:23.750 --> 01:09:26.979
to deal with when we want
to describe coherent states

01:09:26.979 --> 01:09:30.455
and when we want to
describe laser lights.

01:09:30.455 --> 01:09:31.930
But this is one
of the properties.

01:09:31.930 --> 01:09:33.950
So therefore, when
I'm now discussing

01:09:33.950 --> 01:09:36.990
with you is what are
the quasi-probabilities

01:09:36.990 --> 01:09:40.520
of a coherent state, it will
not be a delta function.

01:09:46.740 --> 01:09:52.040
But we should simply
follow the definition,

01:09:52.040 --> 01:09:55.120
and everything will
fall into place.

01:09:55.120 --> 01:10:02.420
So our statistical operator
for a pure coherent state

01:10:02.420 --> 01:10:06.730
is, of course-- this is
a statistical operator

01:10:06.730 --> 01:10:09.040
with pure state beta.

01:10:09.040 --> 01:10:14.200
And the quasi-probability
for the coherent state beta

01:10:14.200 --> 01:10:24.505
to be an alpha is this
matrix element squared.

01:10:27.580 --> 01:10:30.370
And you can calculate
that, for instance,

01:10:30.370 --> 01:10:36.610
by just putting in
alpha, alpha and beta,

01:10:36.610 --> 01:10:39.580
the expansion of alpha
and beta in number states.

01:10:39.580 --> 01:10:44.100
So just have to solve the
integral and calculate it.

01:10:44.100 --> 01:10:50.870
And what you find is
not a delta function,

01:10:50.870 --> 01:10:53.290
but a decaying exponential.

01:10:53.290 --> 01:10:58.260
So you can say, as long
as alpha and beta do not

01:10:58.260 --> 01:11:03.280
differ by more than one,
there is substantial overlap.

01:11:03.280 --> 01:11:06.740
So in other words, what we
get for this quasi-probability

01:11:06.740 --> 01:11:12.600
is something which
is centered at beta.

01:11:15.260 --> 01:11:16.550
But it is again a Gaussian.

01:11:20.840 --> 01:11:28.390
So the important message
here is coherent states

01:11:28.390 --> 01:11:30.400
are not orthogonal
to each other.

01:11:37.130 --> 01:11:39.195
They form an over
complete basis.

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.930
Maybe as a side remark,
it may come as a surprise

01:11:45.930 --> 01:11:49.760
to you, because you have been
trained too much in basis

01:11:49.760 --> 01:11:54.490
states of emission operators,
of energy eigenstates.

01:11:54.490 --> 01:11:58.470
And those energy eigenstates
form a complete basis.

01:11:58.470 --> 01:12:00.900
The coherent states
are eigenfunctions

01:12:00.900 --> 01:12:03.870
of very strange operator,
a non-emission annihilation

01:12:03.870 --> 01:12:05.450
operator.

01:12:05.450 --> 01:12:09.190
So therefore, the few
things you took for granted

01:12:09.190 --> 01:12:10.190
do not apply here.

01:12:15.110 --> 01:12:23.820
So we have our nice diagram
with-- [INAUDIBLE] diagram

01:12:23.820 --> 01:12:26.050
for quasi-probabilities.

01:12:26.050 --> 01:12:31.660
So now if you have-- that
was the real part of alpha.

01:12:31.660 --> 01:12:34.690
That was the imaginary
part of alpha.

01:12:34.690 --> 01:12:39.020
So if you take that
as a complex plane,

01:12:39.020 --> 01:12:44.770
and I'm drawing now as a
phase of the complex number

01:12:44.770 --> 01:12:48.870
beta, which is the eigenvalue
of the coherent state beta,

01:12:48.870 --> 01:12:58.910
then the quasi-probability
is centered near beta.

01:12:58.910 --> 01:13:00.120
And it's a decaying Gaussian.

01:13:04.850 --> 01:13:07.470
I'm not showing it
in here explicitly,

01:13:07.470 --> 01:13:09.490
but it is simply
the vacuum state

01:13:09.490 --> 01:13:12.375
we discussed before
displaced by beta.

01:13:22.760 --> 01:13:25.510
My fourth example,
just to show you.

01:13:25.510 --> 01:13:28.250
So far, I've shown you that
everything is Gaussian.

01:13:28.250 --> 01:13:30.910
Thermal light is a broad
Gaussian, coherent state

01:13:30.910 --> 01:13:35.061
is a narrow Gaussian, the vacuum
state is a narrow Gaussian.

01:13:35.061 --> 01:13:36.560
Let me just show
you something which

01:13:36.560 --> 01:13:40.790
is non-Gaussian, which
is the number state.

01:13:40.790 --> 01:13:44.890
If you put into the definition
of the quasi-probability

01:13:44.890 --> 01:13:49.360
the number state, and you
calculate the quasi-probability

01:13:49.360 --> 01:14:00.160
as a function of alpha, then
you find that what you get

01:14:00.160 --> 01:14:04.260
is actually not a Gaussian.

01:14:04.260 --> 01:14:07.790
What you get is a ring, a
ring with a certain width.

01:14:10.810 --> 01:14:15.880
So this is the representation
of a number state.

01:14:18.740 --> 01:14:29.940
And the radius of this ring is
proportional to the square root

01:14:29.940 --> 01:14:33.920
of the number of photons
in a number state.

01:14:33.920 --> 01:14:38.490
We'll come back to photon states
in much more detail very soon.

01:14:38.490 --> 01:14:40.950
But I just wanted to show
you that at this point.

01:14:40.950 --> 01:14:43.950
So quasi-probabilities
are not always Gaussian.

01:14:43.950 --> 01:14:46.230
They really depict
something, they

01:14:46.230 --> 01:14:49.255
show us something
important about-- they

01:14:49.255 --> 01:14:51.760
show us important
differences about the quantum

01:14:51.760 --> 01:14:52.450
states of light.

01:15:01.750 --> 01:15:02.990
Any questions?

01:15:02.990 --> 01:15:03.796
Yes.

01:15:03.796 --> 01:15:07.198
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] a delta
function [INAUDIBLE] radius,

01:15:07.198 --> 01:15:09.640
[INAUDIBLE] little
past [INAUDIBLE]?

01:15:09.640 --> 01:15:12.690
PROFESSOR: Can you hold the
question for three minutes?

01:15:12.690 --> 01:15:14.470
OK.

01:15:14.470 --> 01:15:17.780
They quick answer is it's not.

01:15:17.780 --> 01:15:20.720
But in three minutes,
I want to tell you

01:15:20.720 --> 01:15:23.000
that there are three
possible definitions

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:26.270
of quasi-probabilities-- the
Q function, to W function,

01:15:26.270 --> 01:15:27.590
and the P function.

01:15:27.590 --> 01:15:29.720
In one of the functions,
it's a delta function.

01:15:29.720 --> 01:15:31.540
In the Q function, it's not.

01:15:31.540 --> 01:15:32.934
But we'll come to that.

01:15:35.556 --> 01:15:37.305
But let's for now stick
to the Q function.

01:15:43.210 --> 01:15:48.750
The next thing we want to put
in is the time dependence.

01:15:48.750 --> 01:15:54.322
I want to show you that when we
have quantum states of light--

01:15:54.322 --> 01:15:56.530
and right now, we've just
shown the quasi-probability

01:15:56.530 --> 01:15:59.900
distribution at a
snapshot of t equals 0.

01:15:59.900 --> 01:16:02.820
What happens as a
function of time?

01:16:02.820 --> 01:16:04.690
What I want to show
you is-- and this

01:16:04.690 --> 01:16:09.620
makes those quasi-probabilities
also nice and intuitive--

01:16:09.620 --> 01:16:13.290
that as a function of time, the
quasi-probability distribution

01:16:13.290 --> 01:16:18.260
simply rotates with an
angular frequency of omega.

01:16:18.260 --> 01:16:21.450
So let me show that to you.

01:16:21.450 --> 01:16:27.600
We know that we have
a coherent state.

01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:29.120
And what we want
to understand is

01:16:29.120 --> 01:16:35.420
what happens when we act on the
coherent state with the time

01:16:35.420 --> 01:16:37.790
propagation operator,
which is the Hamiltonian

01:16:37.790 --> 01:16:41.260
in the exponent.

01:16:41.260 --> 01:16:47.270
Well, in order to evaluate
the left hand side,

01:16:47.270 --> 01:16:55.060
we can simply take the
expansion of coherent states

01:16:55.060 --> 01:17:01.000
into in a number
basis, because we

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:10.030
know that the time
evolution of a number state

01:17:10.030 --> 01:17:20.020
is simply the energy
of the number state

01:17:20.020 --> 01:17:22.260
with which it's given by
the energy of the number

01:17:22.260 --> 01:17:24.040
state, which is n
times h bar omega.

01:17:31.780 --> 01:17:41.030
So now if you look for a
second at this expression,

01:17:41.030 --> 01:17:47.086
you realize that we can
absorb the time evolution

01:17:47.086 --> 01:17:55.610
if you redefine alpha to become
alpha times e to the i omega t.

01:17:55.610 --> 01:18:00.320
So in other words, the time
evolution of the coherent state

01:18:00.320 --> 01:18:06.040
alpha preserves the character
as a coherent state.

01:18:06.040 --> 01:18:09.290
It just means we get
an incoherent state

01:18:09.290 --> 01:18:13.600
whose eigenvalue is now alpha
times e to the i omega t.

01:18:19.830 --> 01:18:24.560
So that means the following.

01:18:24.560 --> 01:18:28.870
If you want to look at the
time evolution in terms

01:18:28.870 --> 01:18:36.260
of quasi-probabilities,
we have our diagram

01:18:36.260 --> 01:18:41.930
with the real part of alpha,
with the imaginary part

01:18:41.930 --> 01:18:42.600
of alpha.

01:18:46.110 --> 01:18:51.020
And let's assume we had
a coherent state, which

01:18:51.020 --> 01:18:54.190
happened-- this is
sort of now my circle.

01:18:54.190 --> 01:18:56.840
It's, you can say,
a high contrast

01:18:56.840 --> 01:18:59.120
representation of the Gaussian.

01:18:59.120 --> 01:19:03.480
So this is the quasi-probability
of the initial state alpha.

01:19:03.480 --> 01:19:07.780
But as time propagates, it
just gets multiplied with e

01:19:07.780 --> 01:19:09.280
to the i omega t.

01:19:09.280 --> 01:19:17.280
That means when the
time evolution is just

01:19:17.280 --> 01:19:21.610
displacing the state over
there, and as time goes by,

01:19:21.610 --> 01:19:25.530
the coherent state is
just moving in a circle.

01:19:25.530 --> 01:19:28.987
And after one full
period of omega,

01:19:28.987 --> 01:19:30.195
we are back where we started.

01:19:48.340 --> 01:19:56.210
Now let me give you now
an intuitive picture

01:19:56.210 --> 01:20:00.310
what the electric field is.

01:20:00.310 --> 01:20:03.520
I will be a little bit more
exact in two or three minutes.

01:20:03.520 --> 01:20:06.610
So we have a diagram of
the real part of alpha

01:20:06.610 --> 01:20:08.816
and the imaginary part of alpha.

01:20:11.720 --> 01:20:21.146
For a harmonic oscillator, I
can also label it as x and p.

01:20:21.146 --> 01:20:23.660
You know, in
harmonic oscillator,

01:20:23.660 --> 01:20:26.990
when you can think
about it classically,

01:20:26.990 --> 01:20:28.990
if you have some
initial distribution

01:20:28.990 --> 01:20:31.750
of a mechanical
oscillator in x and p,

01:20:31.750 --> 01:20:34.640
what the system actually
does is it simply

01:20:34.640 --> 01:20:37.880
rotates on a circle
in phase space.

01:20:37.880 --> 01:20:40.760
The classical phase
space is x and p.

01:20:40.760 --> 01:20:42.925
And I haven't really
told you that I

01:20:42.925 --> 01:20:49.690
was-- I didn't want to get
lost in complex definitions.

01:20:49.690 --> 01:20:52.120
I defined for you the
quasi-probability,

01:20:52.120 --> 01:20:57.670
but the quasi-probability
is a generalization

01:20:57.670 --> 01:21:01.240
of the classical
phase space function.

01:21:01.240 --> 01:21:04.600
Phase space function is
a function of p and x.

01:21:04.600 --> 01:21:08.110
So take my word for
a second, and allow

01:21:08.110 --> 01:21:13.800
me to identify the real axis
with x and the imaginary axis

01:21:13.800 --> 01:21:15.910
with p.

01:21:15.910 --> 01:21:21.910
Well, then p is
the electric field.

01:21:21.910 --> 01:21:26.940
So now, what you should visually
take from those pictures

01:21:26.940 --> 01:21:31.770
is that if you want to know
what the electric field is,

01:21:31.770 --> 01:21:35.120
you just sort of
project this fuzzy

01:21:35.120 --> 01:21:38.760
ball on the imaginary axis.

01:21:38.760 --> 01:21:44.300
So in other words,
when I ask you

01:21:44.300 --> 01:21:51.640
what is now the electric field
as a function of time, at t

01:21:51.640 --> 01:21:59.830
equals 0, I project
this onto the p axis.

01:21:59.830 --> 01:22:05.860
And what I get is something
which is centered at 0.

01:22:11.100 --> 01:22:13.990
But it has also a
certain fuzziness.

01:22:13.990 --> 01:22:16.880
The fuzziness is given
by the size of the disk,

01:22:16.880 --> 01:22:19.760
or by the width of the Gaussian.

01:22:19.760 --> 01:22:23.150
And if I now use this picture
as a function of time,

01:22:23.150 --> 01:22:28.490
as this fuzzy ball
rotates around,

01:22:28.490 --> 01:22:35.080
the electric field goes
up and down in one cycle.

01:22:39.250 --> 01:22:41.140
And the fuzziness moves with it.

01:22:44.970 --> 01:22:53.510
So the fuzziness here for the
electric field is related--

01:22:53.510 --> 01:22:57.770
and that's what we want
to discuss next week--

01:22:57.770 --> 01:23:00.840
is related to short noise.

01:23:00.840 --> 01:23:04.360
I also want to tell you
that the coherent state is,

01:23:04.360 --> 01:23:08.020
to some extent, the
best possible way

01:23:08.020 --> 01:23:10.010
to define an electric field.

01:23:10.010 --> 01:23:12.600
It's a minimum
uncertainty state.

01:23:12.600 --> 01:23:14.840
I want to show you that
the coherent state is

01:23:14.840 --> 01:23:17.000
sort of at the minimum of
Heisenberg's Uncertainty

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.260
Relation.

01:23:19.260 --> 01:23:21.790
So I think if you
take this picture,

01:23:21.790 --> 01:23:25.010
you will immediately
realize that you

01:23:25.010 --> 01:23:28.550
draw the quasi-probability, you
project on the vertical axis.

01:23:28.550 --> 01:23:32.080
And you get the electric field
that tells you immediately

01:23:32.080 --> 01:23:33.920
if you have a
thermal state, which

01:23:33.920 --> 01:23:35.660
is a Gaussian centered here.

01:23:35.660 --> 01:23:36.820
You project it.

01:23:36.820 --> 01:23:39.920
You get an electric field 0.

01:23:39.920 --> 01:23:43.170
It has an enormous
fuzziness, but it's 0.

01:23:43.170 --> 01:23:48.970
And this picture that everything
rotates with angular frequency

01:23:48.970 --> 01:23:51.620
omega also tells
you, as expected,

01:23:51.620 --> 01:23:54.620
that in a thermal
state, it's already

01:23:54.620 --> 01:23:57.040
a circularly symmetric
distribution.

01:23:57.040 --> 01:23:59.998
When it rotates,
nothing changes.

01:23:59.998 --> 01:24:02.742
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE],
couldn't you

01:24:02.742 --> 01:24:04.988
find, eigenstates for
that operator itself,

01:24:04.988 --> 01:24:06.984
and then get rid
of this fuzziness?

01:24:22.952 --> 01:24:24.948
AUDIENCE: Could
it just be, like,

01:24:24.948 --> 01:24:29.938
eigenstates of the
harmonic oscillator, so not

01:24:29.938 --> 01:24:31.435
stationary at all?

01:24:36.470 --> 01:24:39.710
PROFESSOR: I'm a little
bit confused now.

01:24:39.710 --> 01:24:44.010
Actually, two people mind if
I teach a few minutes longer?

01:24:44.010 --> 01:24:47.050
I can just finish the--
I want to have one,

01:24:47.050 --> 01:24:47.940
I have one footnote.

01:24:47.940 --> 01:24:49.820
I really want to sort
of give it to you,

01:24:49.820 --> 01:24:52.622
because I think it
will help some of you.

01:24:52.622 --> 01:24:53.122
Pardon?

01:24:53.122 --> 01:24:55.110
AUDIENCE: We have a
class starting at 2:30.

01:24:55.110 --> 01:24:56.460
PROFESSOR: There's a
class starting at 2:30?

01:24:56.460 --> 01:24:57.290
AUDIENCE: Yes.

01:24:57.290 --> 01:24:58.945
PROFESSOR: Then I
have to wrap up.

01:24:58.945 --> 01:24:59.445
Sorry.

01:25:02.650 --> 01:25:04.580
Then let me just
tell you what I will

01:25:04.580 --> 01:25:06.620
do at the beginning
of the next class.

01:25:06.620 --> 01:25:08.940
What I've told you here
with the projection

01:25:08.940 --> 01:25:12.710
of the electric
field, this is not

01:25:12.710 --> 01:25:17.610
100% rigorous for the
quasi-probabilities Q.

01:25:17.610 --> 01:25:19.930
Due to the non-commutativity
of operators,

01:25:19.930 --> 01:25:24.850
when we generalize phase
space function into quantum

01:25:24.850 --> 01:25:28.730
mechanics, we can order
operators in a symmetric way,

01:25:28.730 --> 01:25:31.000
in a normal way, in
an anti- normal way.

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.770
And therefore, there are three
different quasi-probabilities.

01:25:33.770 --> 01:25:37.400
The Q probability is
the easiest to define.

01:25:37.400 --> 01:25:39.170
It comes in very handy.

01:25:39.170 --> 01:25:41.670
But what I showed you
with the projection

01:25:41.670 --> 01:25:44.840
does not rigorously apply
to the Q distribution.

01:25:44.840 --> 01:25:48.500
It applies to the p
or w distribution.

01:25:48.500 --> 01:25:51.720
But the difference is, unless
you really go into subtleties,

01:25:51.720 --> 01:25:52.780
are minor.

01:25:52.780 --> 01:25:55.440
So intuitively, what
I did is correct.

01:25:55.440 --> 01:25:57.790
And to answer your
question, an eigenstate

01:25:57.790 --> 01:26:01.340
of the electric field, I have a
little bit problems with that.

01:26:01.340 --> 01:26:04.060
Because if you take this
projection, what you need

01:26:04.060 --> 01:26:07.450
is you need something
which is very, very narrow.

01:26:07.450 --> 01:26:10.930
But since this area is
in Heisenberg uncertainty

01:26:10.930 --> 01:26:15.880
limited area, it means delta
x delta p equals h bar over 2.

01:26:15.880 --> 01:26:18.490
The only way how you can
create this electric field

01:26:18.490 --> 01:26:21.020
is you can completely
squeeze it.

01:26:21.020 --> 01:26:24.540
So to the best of my knowledge,
an electric field eigenstate

01:26:24.540 --> 01:26:27.800
would be a completely
strongly squeezed state.

01:26:27.800 --> 01:26:29.830
We'll talk about that next week.

01:26:29.830 --> 01:26:31.690
But then you realize,
if you've completed

01:26:31.690 --> 01:26:36.650
squeezed your state
after a quarter period,

01:26:36.650 --> 01:26:42.560
this infinitely squeezed ellipse
is now standing upside down.

01:26:42.560 --> 01:26:45.090
And after a quarter
period your electric field

01:26:45.090 --> 01:26:46.860
is completely uncertain.

01:26:46.860 --> 01:26:49.520
So I think you can
define an operator,

01:26:49.520 --> 01:26:51.620
you can find a state
which has a sharp value

01:26:51.620 --> 01:26:54.320
of the electric field
at one moment of time.

01:26:54.320 --> 01:26:56.440
But then it rotates around.

01:26:56.440 --> 01:26:59.060
And what was a highly
certain electric field

01:26:59.060 --> 01:27:02.840
becomes highly uncertain later.

01:27:02.840 --> 01:27:04.950
OK, enough things to discuss.

01:27:04.950 --> 01:27:07.480
We'll go on next week.

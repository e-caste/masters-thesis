00:00:21.157 --> 00:00:22.490
JOSH TENENBAUM: We're going to--

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.189
I'm just going to give a
bunch of examples of things

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:26.480
that we in our field have done.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.730
Most of them are things that
I've played some role in.

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.075
Maybe it was a thesis
project of a student.

00:00:31.075 --> 00:00:33.200
But they're meant to be
representative of a broader

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.199
set of things that many
people have been working

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:37.349
on developing this toolkit.

00:00:37.349 --> 00:00:39.890
And we're going to start from
the beginning in a sense-- just

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:41.870
some very simple
things that we did

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.720
to try to look at ways in
which probabilistic, generative

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.486
models can inform people's
basic cognitive processes.

00:00:48.486 --> 00:00:50.360
And then build up to
more interestingly kinds

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.610
of symbolically structured
models, hierarchical models,

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.670
and ultimately to these
probabilistic programs

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.865
for common sense.

00:00:57.865 --> 00:00:59.990
So when I say a lot of
people have been doing this,

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:02.073
I mean here's just a small
number of these people.

00:01:02.073 --> 00:01:04.340
Every year or two, I try
to update this slide.

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:07.321
But it's very much
historically dated with people

00:01:07.321 --> 00:01:09.320
that I knew when I was
in grad school basically.

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.240
There's a lot of
really great work

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.542
by younger people who
maybe their names haven't

00:01:14.542 --> 00:01:15.500
appeared on this slide.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.554
So those dot dot dots
are extremely serious.

00:01:17.554 --> 00:01:19.720
And a lot of the best stuff
is not included on here.

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.040
But in the last
couple of decades,

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.470
across basically all
the different areas

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:26.180
of cognitive science
that cover basically

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.520
all the different things
that cognition does,

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.847
there's been great progress
building serious mathematical--

00:01:31.847 --> 00:01:34.430
and what we could call reverse
engineering models in the sense

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.130
that they are quantitative
models of human cognition,

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.944
but they are phrased in
the terms of engineering,

00:01:40.944 --> 00:01:42.860
the same things you would
use to build a robot

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.900
to do these things,
at least in principle.

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.080
And it's been
developing this toolkit

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.390
of probabalistic
generative models.

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.310
I want to start
off by telling you

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.010
a little bit about some
work that I did together

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:56.180
with Tom Griffiths.

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:00.020
So Tom is now a senior
faculty member at Berkeley,

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:01.714
one of the leaders
in this field--

00:02:01.714 --> 00:02:04.130
as well as a leading person
in machine learning, actually.

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:05.713
One of the great
things that he's done

00:02:05.713 --> 00:02:08.120
is to take inspiration
from human learning

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:11.320
and develop fundamentally new
kinds of probabilistic models,

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.130
in non-parametric
Bayes in particular,

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.800
inspired by human learning.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.230
But when Tom was a grad
student, we worked together.

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:20.420
He was my first student.

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:21.530
We're almost the same age.

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.660
So at this point, we're
more like senior colleagues

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:24.685
than student advisor.

00:02:24.685 --> 00:02:26.060
But I'll tell you
about some work

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:27.500
we did back when
he was a student,

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:28.760
and I was just starting off.

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.160
And we were both together
trying to tackle this problem

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:36.440
and trying to see, OK, what are
the prospects for understanding

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.380
even very basic cognitive
intuitions, like senses

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.840
of similarity or the most
basic kinds of causal discovery

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.090
intuitions like we were
talking about before,

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.460
using some kind of idea
of probabilistic inference

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:48.280
in a generative model?

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.360
And at the time-- remember
in the introduction

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.280
I was talking about how
there's been this back

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.780
and forth discourse over the
decades of people saying, yeah,

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.601
rah rah, statistics,
and, statistics,

00:02:59.601 --> 00:03:01.100
those are trivial
and uninteresting?

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.058
And at the time we started
to do this, at least

00:03:03.058 --> 00:03:05.180
in cognitive
psychology, the idea

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.520
that cognition could
be seen as some kind

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.140
of sophisticated
statistical inference

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.100
was very much not
a popular idea.

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.000
But we thought that it
was fundamentally right

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.990
in some ways.

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:16.130
And it was at the time--

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:19.250
again, this was work we were
doing in the early 2000s

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.830
when it was very clear in
machine learning and AI

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:24.410
already how transformative
these ideas were

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:26.300
in building intelligent
machines or starting

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:27.470
to build intelligent machines.

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:29.120
So it seemed clear to
us that at least it

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.536
was a good hypothesis worth
exploring and taking much more

00:03:31.536 --> 00:03:34.790
seriously than psychologists
had much before that.

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.430
That this also could
describe basic aspects

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:38.630
of human thinking.

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:41.930
So I'll give you a couple
examples of what we did here.

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.200
Here's a simple kind of causal
inference from coincidences,

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.720
much like what you saw
going on in the video game.

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:50.720
There's no time in this.

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.840
It's really mostly just space,
or maybe a little bit of time.

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.090
The motivation was not a
video game, but imagine--

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.990
to put a real world
context on it--

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:02.510
what's sometimes called cancer
clusters or rare disease

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:03.150
clusters.

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.400
You can read about these
often in the newspaper, where

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.140
somebody has seen some evidence
suggestive of some maybe

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:10.700
hidden environmental cause--

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:14.810
maybe it's a toxic chemical
leak or something--

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:16.940
that seems to be responsible
for-- or maybe they

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:17.731
don't have a cause.

00:04:17.731 --> 00:04:19.670
They just see a
suspicious coincidence

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:23.750
of some very rare disease, a
few cases that seem surprisingly

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:25.560
clustered in space and time.

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.330
So for example, let's say this
is one square mile of a city.

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:34.070
And each dot represents one case
of some very rare disease that

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:36.106
occurred in the span of a year.

00:04:36.106 --> 00:04:36.980
And you look at this.

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:39.230
And you might think
that, well, it

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:41.990
doesn't look like those dots are
completely, uniformly, randomly

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.710
distributed over there.

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:44.480
Maybe there's some
weird thing going on

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:47.855
in the upper left or
northwest corner--

00:04:47.855 --> 00:04:49.220
some who knows what--

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:50.390
making people sick.

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:51.740
So let me just ask you.

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:56.300
On a scale of 0 to 10,
where 10 means you're sure

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.580
there's some kind
of thing going on

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:02.122
and some special cause
in some part of this map.

00:05:02.122 --> 00:05:04.580
And 0 means no, you're quite
sure there's nothing going on.

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:06.290
It's just random.

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:08.870
What do you say?

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:11.660
To what extent does this give
evidence for some hidden cause?

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:13.718
So give me a number
between 0 and 10.

00:05:13.718 --> 00:05:15.167
AUDIENCE: 5.

00:05:15.167 --> 00:05:16.250
JOSH TENENBAUM: OK, great.

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:17.014
5, 2, 7.

00:05:17.014 --> 00:05:18.680
I heard a few examples
of each of those.

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:19.180
Perfect.

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:20.442
That's exactly what people do.

00:05:20.442 --> 00:05:22.400
You could do the same
thing on Mechanical Turk,

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.060
and get 10 times as much
data, and pay a lot more.

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:27.512
It would be the same.

00:05:27.512 --> 00:05:28.970
I'll show you the
data in a second.

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:30.990
But here's the
model that we built.

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:33.620
So again, this model
is a very simple kind

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:36.560
of generative model
of a hidden cause

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:38.390
that various people
in statistics

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:40.130
have worked with for a while.

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:45.490
We're basically modeling a
hidden cause as a mixture.

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:47.140
Or I mean it's a
generative model,

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:49.130
so we have to model
the whole data.

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:50.741
When we say there's
a hidden cause,

00:05:50.741 --> 00:05:53.240
we don't necessarily mean that
everything is caused by this.

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:56.570
It's just that the data
we see in this picture

00:05:56.570 --> 00:06:01.250
is a mixture of whatever the
normal random thing going on is

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:05.420
plus possibly some spatially
localized cause that

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:08.570
has some unknown
position, unknown extent.

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:10.160
Maybe it's a very big region.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.720
And some unknown
intensity-- maybe

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:13.910
it's causing a lot of
cases or not that many.

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:16.280
The hypothesis space maybe
is best visualized like this.

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:19.790
Each of these squares is
a different hypothesis

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:21.980
of a mixture density
or a mixture model--

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:24.650
which is a mixture of just
whatever the normal uniform

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:28.490
process is that causes a disease
unrelated to space and then

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:31.730
some kind of just Gaussian bump,
which can vary in location,

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:36.110
size, and intensity, that
is the possible hidden cause

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:37.670
of some of these cases.

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:39.840
And what the model
that we propose says

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:41.932
is that your sense of
this spatial coincidence--

00:06:41.932 --> 00:06:44.390
like when you look at a pattern
of dots really and you see,

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:46.931
oh, that looks like there's a
hidden cluster there somewhere.

00:06:46.931 --> 00:06:50.466
It's basically you're trying to
see whether something like one

00:06:50.466 --> 00:06:53.090
of those things on the right is
going on as opposed to the null

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:55.280
hypothesis of just
pure randomness.

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:59.150
So we take this log
likelihood ratio,

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:01.700
or log probability,
where we're comparing

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:05.120
the probability of the
data under the hypothesis

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:08.720
that there's some
interesting hidden cause, one

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:11.300
of the things on the right,
versus the alternative

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:12.710
hypothesis that
it's just random,

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:15.641
which is just the simple,
completely uniform density.

00:07:15.641 --> 00:07:18.140
And what makes this a little
bit interesting computationally

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:21.560
is that there's an infinite
number of these possibilities

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:22.350
on the right.

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:26.000
There's an infinite number
of different locations

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.819
and sizes and intensities
of the Gaussian.

00:07:27.819 --> 00:07:29.610
And you have to integrate
over all of them.

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:31.484
So again, there's not
going to be a whole lot

00:07:31.484 --> 00:07:33.150
of mathematical details here.

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:35.210
But you can read
about this stuff

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:39.410
if you want to read these
papers that we had here.

00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:42.800
But for those of you who
are familiar with this,

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:44.870
with working with
latent variable models,

00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:50.240
effectively what
you're doing is just

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:54.200
integrating either analytically
or in a simulation over all

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:56.570
the possible models
and sort of trying

00:07:56.570 --> 00:07:59.087
to compute on average how
much does the evidence support

00:07:59.087 --> 00:08:01.670
something like what you see on
the right, one of those cluster

00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:04.730
possibilities, versus
just uniform density.

00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:06.920
And now what I'm showing
you is that model

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:10.260
compared to people's
judgments on an experiment.

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.590
So in this experiment,
we showed people patterns

00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:14.120
like the one you just saw.

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:17.780
The one you saw
is this one here.

00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:20.900
But in the different
stimuli, we varied parameters

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:22.610
that we thought
would be relevant.

00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:26.300
So we varied how many
points were there total,

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:29.000
how strong the cluster was in
various ways, whether it was

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.640
very tightly
clustered or very big,

00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:35.270
the relative number of points
in the cluster versus not.

00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:37.039
So what you can see
here, for example,

00:08:37.039 --> 00:08:39.230
is it's a very similar
kind of geometry,

00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:43.179
except here this is a
sort of biggish cluster.

00:08:43.179 --> 00:08:46.340
And then we're making basically
there's four points that look

00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:47.870
clustered and two that aren't.

00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:50.000
And in these cases, we
just make the four points

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.500
more tightly clustered.

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:54.890
Here, what we're
doing is we're going

00:08:54.890 --> 00:08:57.961
from having no points that look
clustered to having almost all

00:08:57.961 --> 00:08:59.960
of the points looking
clustered and just varying

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:03.200
the ratio of clustered points
to non-clustered points.

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:05.160
Here, we're just changing
the overall number.

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:07.576
So notice that this one is
basically the same as this one.

00:09:11.036 --> 00:09:12.410
So again, at both
of these, we've

00:09:12.410 --> 00:09:15.601
got four clustered points and
two seemingly non-clustered

00:09:15.601 --> 00:09:16.100
ones.

00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:18.440
And here we just scale
up in set-- or scale

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:20.270
up from four to two,
to eight and four.

00:09:20.270 --> 00:09:23.107
And here we scale it
down to two and one,

00:09:23.107 --> 00:09:24.440
and various other manipulations.

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:25.910
And what you can
see is that they

00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:28.604
have various systematic
effects on people's judgments.

00:09:28.604 --> 00:09:30.020
So what I'm calling
the data there

00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:32.292
is the average of
about 150 people

00:09:32.292 --> 00:09:33.750
who did the same
judgment you did--

00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:35.000
0 to 10.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.810
What you can see is the one
I gave you was this one here.

00:09:38.810 --> 00:09:41.372
And the average judgment
was almost exactly five.

00:09:41.372 --> 00:09:42.830
And if you look at
the variance, it

00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:44.040
looks just like
what you saw here.

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:45.290
Some people say two or three.

00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:47.250
Some people say seven.

00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:49.374
I chose one that was
right in the middle.

00:09:49.374 --> 00:09:51.290
The interesting thing
is that, while you maybe

00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:52.700
felt like you were
guessing-- and if you just

00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:54.020
listened to what
everyone else was saying,

00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:56.561
maybe it sounds like we're just
shouting out random numbers--

00:09:56.561 --> 00:09:58.019
that's not what you're doing.

00:09:58.019 --> 00:09:59.810
On that one, it looks
like it, because it's

00:09:59.810 --> 00:10:00.839
right on the threshold.

00:10:00.839 --> 00:10:03.130
But if you look over all
these different patterns, what

00:10:03.130 --> 00:10:05.500
you see is that sometimes
people give much higher numbers

00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:05.930
than others.

00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:08.096
Sometimes people give much
lower number than others.

00:10:08.096 --> 00:10:10.579
And the details,
that variation, both

00:10:10.579 --> 00:10:12.370
within these different
manipulations we did

00:10:12.370 --> 00:10:14.710
and across them,
are almost perfectly

00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:17.560
captured by this very simple
probabilistic generative

00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:18.890
model for a latent cause.

00:10:18.890 --> 00:10:22.084
So the model here is-- this is
the predictions that model I

00:10:22.084 --> 00:10:23.500
showed you is
making, where again,

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:25.510
basically, a high
bar means there's

00:10:25.510 --> 00:10:30.700
strong evidence in favor of the
hidden latent cause hypothesis.

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:33.760
Some, one, or more--

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:36.400
some cluster-- that low
bar means strong evidence

00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:38.020
for the alternative hypothesis.

00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:39.760
The scale is a bit arbitrary.

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:43.302
And it's a log
probability ratio scale.

00:10:43.302 --> 00:10:45.010
So I'm not going to
comment on the scale.

00:10:45.010 --> 00:10:47.384
But importantly, it's the same
scale across all of these.

00:10:47.384 --> 00:10:49.810
So a big difference is,
it's the same big difference

00:10:49.810 --> 00:10:51.200
in both cases.

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:53.136
And I don't think this
is fairly good evidence

00:10:53.136 --> 00:10:54.760
that this model is
capturing your sense

00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:57.130
of spatial coincidence
and showing that it's not

00:10:57.130 --> 00:10:59.272
just random or arbitrary,
but it's actually

00:10:59.272 --> 00:11:01.480
a very rational measure of
how much evidence there is

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:03.850
in the data for a hidden cause.

00:11:03.850 --> 00:11:05.364
Here's the same
model now applied

00:11:05.364 --> 00:11:07.030
to a different data
set that we actually

00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:09.102
collected a few
years before, which

00:11:09.102 --> 00:11:10.810
just varies the same
kinds of parameters,

00:11:10.810 --> 00:11:12.160
but has a lot more points.

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:15.534
And the same model works
in those cases, too.

00:11:15.534 --> 00:11:17.200
The differences are
a little more subtle

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:20.350
with these more points.

00:11:20.350 --> 00:11:24.790
So I'll give you one other
example of this sort of thing.

00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:26.890
Like the one I just
showed you, we're

00:11:26.890 --> 00:11:29.200
taking a fairly simple
statistical model.

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:31.400
This one, as you'll see,
isn't even really causal.

00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:33.400
This one at least, that
I showed you, is causal.

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:35.230
The advantage of
this other one is

00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:38.175
that it's both a kind of
textbook statistics example,

00:11:38.175 --> 00:11:40.300
it's one where people do
something more interesting

00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:41.380
than what's in the textbook.

00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:43.588
Although you can extend the
textbook analysis to make

00:11:43.588 --> 00:11:45.250
it look like what people do.

00:11:45.250 --> 00:11:47.200
And unlike in this
case here, you

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:49.210
can actually measure
the empirical statistic.

00:11:49.210 --> 00:11:51.340
You can go out, and instead
of just like positing,

00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:54.944
here's a simple model of what
a latent environmental cause

00:11:54.944 --> 00:11:56.860
would be like, you can
actually go and measure

00:11:56.860 --> 00:11:58.870
all the relevant
probability distributions

00:11:58.870 --> 00:12:01.530
and compare people not
just with a notional model,

00:12:01.530 --> 00:12:03.570
but with what, in
some stronger sense,

00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:05.890
is the rational
thing to do, if you

00:12:05.890 --> 00:12:09.140
were doing some kind of
intuitive Bayesian inference.

00:12:09.140 --> 00:12:11.290
So these are, again
stuff that Tom Griffiths

00:12:11.290 --> 00:12:15.540
did with me, in an in and
then after grad school.

00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:17.290
We asked people to
make the following kind

00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:18.400
of everyday prediction.

00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:21.520
So we said, suppose you
read about a movie that's

00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:23.650
made $60 million to date.

00:12:23.650 --> 00:12:25.505
How much money will
it make in total?

00:12:25.505 --> 00:12:27.130
Or you see that
something's been baking

00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:28.610
in the oven for 34 minutes.

00:12:28.610 --> 00:12:30.310
How long until it's ready?

00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:31.810
You meet someone
who's 78 years old.

00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:33.570
How long will they live?

00:12:33.570 --> 00:12:36.070
Your friend quotes to you from
line 17 of his favorite poem.

00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:37.510
How long is the poem?

00:12:37.510 --> 00:12:40.000
Or you meet a US congressman
who has served for 11 years.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.770
How long will he serve in total?

00:12:41.770 --> 00:12:43.420
So in each of
these cases, you're

00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:46.990
encountering some
phenomenon or event

00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:49.410
in the world with some
unknown total duration.

00:12:49.410 --> 00:12:51.100
We'll call that t, total.

00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:53.770
And all we know is that
t, total, is somewhere

00:12:53.770 --> 00:12:55.090
between zero and infinity.

00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:58.426
We might have a prior on it,
as you'll see in a second.

00:12:58.426 --> 00:13:00.977
But we don't know very much
about this particular t,

00:13:00.977 --> 00:13:04.210
total except you get one
example, one piece of data,

00:13:04.210 --> 00:13:08.227
some t, which we'll just
assume is just randomly sampled

00:13:08.227 --> 00:13:09.310
between zero and t, total.

00:13:09.310 --> 00:13:11.440
So all we know is that
whatever these things are,

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:14.830
it's something randomly chosen,
less than the total extent

00:13:14.830 --> 00:13:17.950
or duration of these events.

00:13:17.950 --> 00:13:19.750
And now we can ask,
what can you guess

00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:21.850
about the total extent
or duration from that one

00:13:21.850 --> 00:13:22.390
observation?

00:13:22.390 --> 00:13:25.600
Or in mathematical terms,
there is some unknown interval

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:27.880
from zero up to
some maximal value.

00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:30.340
You can put a prior on
what that interval is.

00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:33.100
And you have to guess the
interval from one sampled point

00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:34.450
sampled randomly within it.

00:13:34.450 --> 00:13:36.250
It's also very similar--
and another reason

00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:38.083
we studied this-- to
the problem of learning

00:13:38.083 --> 00:13:39.620
a concept from one example.

00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:41.870
When you're learning what
horses are from one example,

00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:43.390
or when you're learning what
that piece of rock climbing

00:13:43.390 --> 00:13:44.740
question is-- what's a cam--

00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:48.154
from one example, or what's
a tufa from one example.

00:13:48.154 --> 00:13:49.570
You can think,
there's some region

00:13:49.570 --> 00:13:51.700
in the space of all possible
objects or something,

00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:52.616
or some set out there.

00:13:52.616 --> 00:13:54.760
And you get one or
a few sample points,

00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:57.000
and you have to figure out
the extent of the region.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.740
It's basically the same kind
of problem, mathematically.

00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:01.240
But what's cool
about this is we can

00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:04.000
measure the priors for these
different classes of events

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.190
and compare people with an
optimal Bayesian inference.

00:14:07.190 --> 00:14:09.550
And you see something
kind of striking.

00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:11.930
So here's, on the top--

00:14:11.930 --> 00:14:13.990
I'm showing two different
kinds of data here.

00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:16.780
On the top are just empirical
statistics of events

00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:19.270
you can measure in the world;
nothing behavioral, nothing

00:14:19.270 --> 00:14:20.470
about cognition.

00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:23.650
On the bottom, I'm showing
some behavioral data

00:14:23.650 --> 00:14:25.540
and comparing it with
model predictions that

00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:28.340
are based on the statistics
that are measured on top.

00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:29.920
So what we have
in each column is

00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:34.000
one of these classes of events,
like movie grosses in dollars.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.090
You can get this data from iMDB,
the Internet Movie Database.

00:14:37.090 --> 00:14:41.470
You can see that most movies
make $100 million or less.

00:14:41.470 --> 00:14:42.730
There's sort of a power law.

00:14:42.730 --> 00:14:46.630
But a few movies make hundreds,
or even many hundreds,

00:14:46.630 --> 00:14:48.647
maybe a billion dollars
even, these days.

00:14:48.647 --> 00:14:50.980
Similarly with poems, they
have a power law distribution

00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:51.549
of length.

00:14:51.549 --> 00:14:52.840
So most poems are pretty short.

00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:54.250
They fit on a page or less.

00:14:54.250 --> 00:14:55.810
But there are some
epic poems, or

00:14:55.810 --> 00:14:58.240
some multi-page-- many,
many hundreds of lines.

00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:01.290
And they fall off
with a long tail.

00:15:01.290 --> 00:15:04.380
Lifespans, movie runtimes
are kind of unimodal, almost

00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:06.030
Gaussian-- not exactly.

00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:09.420
Those red curves,
histograms' bars,

00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:11.070
show the empirical
statistics that we

00:15:11.070 --> 00:15:13.050
measured from public data.

00:15:13.050 --> 00:15:15.171
And the red curves
show just the best fit

00:15:15.171 --> 00:15:17.670
of a simple parametric model,
like a Gaussian or a power law

00:15:17.670 --> 00:15:20.130
distribution that
I'm mentioning.

00:15:20.130 --> 00:15:22.740
House of representatives-- how
long people serve in the House

00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:24.840
has this kind of gamma,
or particular gamma

00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:28.020
called an Erlang shape
with a little bit

00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:29.820
of an incumbent effect.

00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:32.640
Cake baking times-- so
remember we asked how long

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:34.506
is this cake going to bake for.

00:15:34.506 --> 00:15:36.880
They don't have any simple
parametric form when you go in

00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:38.240
and look at cookbooks.

00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:41.132
But you see, there's
something systematic there.

00:15:41.132 --> 00:15:42.840
There's a lot of things
that are supposed

00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:44.610
to bake for exactly an hour.

00:15:44.610 --> 00:15:48.360
There are some which have
a smaller, or a shorter,

00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:49.080
but broad mode.

00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:53.090
And then there's a few epic
90-minute cakes out there.

00:15:53.090 --> 00:15:54.900
So that's all the
empirical statistics.

00:15:54.900 --> 00:15:59.410
Now what you're seeing on
the bottom is people's--

00:15:59.410 --> 00:16:01.990
well, on the y-axis,
the vertical axis,

00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:04.080
you have the average--
it's a median--

00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:06.990
of a bunch of human predictions
for the total extent

00:16:06.990 --> 00:16:09.990
of any one of these
things, like your guess

00:16:09.990 --> 00:16:12.150
of the total length
of a poem given that,

00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:14.310
basically, there
is a line 17 in it.

00:16:14.310 --> 00:16:16.880
And on the x-axis, what you're
seeing is that one data point,

00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:18.630
the one value of t,
which is, all you know

00:16:18.630 --> 00:16:20.671
is that it's somewhere
between zero and t, total.

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:25.470
So different groups
of subjects were

00:16:25.470 --> 00:16:26.640
given five different values.

00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:29.340
So you see five black dots,
which correspond to what

00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:31.080
five different
subgroups of subjects

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:35.106
said for each of these
possible t values.

00:16:35.106 --> 00:16:36.480
And then the black
and red curves

00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:39.150
are the model fit,
which comes from taking

00:16:39.150 --> 00:16:42.000
a certain kind of Bayesian
optimal prediction, where

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.070
the prior is what's
specified on the top-- that's

00:16:44.070 --> 00:16:45.480
the prior on t, total.

00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:50.920
The likelihood is a sort
of uniform random density.

00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:54.045
So it's just saying t is just a
uniform random sample from zero

00:16:54.045 --> 00:16:55.140
up to t, total.

00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:57.870
You put those together
to compute a posterior.

00:16:57.870 --> 00:17:00.390
And then you-- the particular
estimator we're using

00:17:00.390 --> 00:17:02.060
is what's called the
posterior median.

00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:03.976
So we're looking at the
median of the exterior

00:17:03.976 --> 00:17:06.270
and comparing that with a
median of human subjects.

00:17:06.270 --> 00:17:11.354
And what you can see is that
it's almost a perfect fit.

00:17:11.354 --> 00:17:13.020
And it doesn't really
matter whether you

00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:16.230
take the red curve, which is
what comes from approximating

00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:18.954
the prior with one of these
simple parametric models,

00:17:18.954 --> 00:17:20.579
or the black one,
which comes from just

00:17:20.579 --> 00:17:22.470
taking the empirical histogram.

00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:24.060
Although, for the
cake baking times,

00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:26.160
you really can only go
for the empirical one.

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:27.910
Because there is no
simple parametric one.

00:17:27.910 --> 00:17:30.930
That's why you just see a
jagged black line there.

00:17:30.930 --> 00:17:34.800
But it's interesting that
it's almost a perfect fit.

00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:36.090
There are a couple--

00:17:36.090 --> 00:17:39.430
just like somebody
asked in Demis's talk--

00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:42.360
there's one or two cases we
found where this model doesn't

00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:45.374
work, sometimes dramatically,
and sometimes a little bit.

00:17:45.374 --> 00:17:46.540
And they're all interesting.

00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:47.650
But I have time
to talk about it.

00:17:47.650 --> 00:17:48.750
That's one of the things
I decided to skip.

00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:50.560
If you'd like to talk about
it, I'm happy to do that.

00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:52.935
But most of the time, in most
of the cases we've studied,

00:17:52.935 --> 00:17:53.977
these are representative.

00:17:53.977 --> 00:17:55.810
And I think, again, all
of the failure cases

00:17:55.810 --> 00:17:56.970
are quite interesting ones.

00:17:56.970 --> 00:17:58.844
That point to, this is
one of the many things

00:17:58.844 --> 00:18:00.360
we need to go beyond.

00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:02.040
But the interesting
thing isn't just

00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:05.220
that the curves fit
the data, but the fact

00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:07.650
that the actual shape is
different in each case.

00:18:07.650 --> 00:18:10.866
Depending on the prior of this
different classes of events,

00:18:10.866 --> 00:18:12.990
you get a fundamentally
different, or qualitatively

00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:14.894
different, prediction function.

00:18:14.894 --> 00:18:15.810
Sometimes it's linear.

00:18:15.810 --> 00:18:16.893
Sometimes it's non-linear.

00:18:16.893 --> 00:18:18.540
Sometimes it has
some weird shape.

00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:23.910
And really, quite
surprisingly to us,

00:18:23.910 --> 00:18:25.410
people seem to be
sensitive to that.

00:18:25.410 --> 00:18:29.640
So they seem to predict in ways
that are reflective of not only

00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:31.140
the optimal Bayesian
thing to do,

00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:34.110
but the optimal Bayesian thing
to do from the optimal prior,

00:18:34.110 --> 00:18:36.420
from the correct prior.

00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:39.050
And I certainly don't want
to suggest that people always

00:18:39.050 --> 00:18:39.550
do this.

00:18:39.550 --> 00:18:40.924
But it was very
interesting to us

00:18:40.924 --> 00:18:44.280
that for just a bunch of
everyday events, and really,

00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:46.800
the places where this
analysis works best

00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:49.470
are ones, again, where we think
people actually might plausibly

00:18:49.470 --> 00:18:52.500
have good reasons to have
the relevant experiences

00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:54.360
with these everyday
events, they seem

00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:58.350
to be sensitive to both the
statistics in the sense of just

00:18:58.350 --> 00:19:00.090
what's going on in
the world and doing

00:19:00.090 --> 00:19:02.980
the right statistical
prediction.

00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:04.095
So that's what we did.

00:19:04.095 --> 00:19:05.886
10 years ago or so,
that was like the state

00:19:05.886 --> 00:19:07.189
of the art for us.

00:19:07.189 --> 00:19:08.730
And then we wanted
to know, well, OK,

00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:11.110
can we take these sorts
of ideas and scale them up

00:19:11.110 --> 00:19:13.110
to some actually interesting
cognitive problems,

00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:17.100
like say, for example, learning
words for object categories.

00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:18.894
And we did some of that.

00:19:18.894 --> 00:19:20.310
I'll show you a
little bit of that

00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:22.680
before showing you what I
think was missing there.

00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:26.980
I mean, in a lot of ways,
this is a harder problem.

00:19:26.980 --> 00:19:28.530
I mean, it's very
similar, as I said.

00:19:28.530 --> 00:19:30.930
It's basically like, there's
just like the problem I just

00:19:30.930 --> 00:19:32.610
showed you, where there
was an unknown total extent

00:19:32.610 --> 00:19:34.950
or duration, and you got
one random sample from it,

00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:36.960
here there is some un--

00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:40.980
imagine the space of
all possible objects--

00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:43.860
could be a manifold or
described by a bunch of knobs.

00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:46.500
I mean, these are all generated
from some computer program.

00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:48.083
If these were real,
biological things,

00:19:48.083 --> 00:19:51.000
they would be generated
from DNA or whatever it is.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:54.660
But there's some huge, maybe
interestingly structured, space

00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:55.920
of all possible objects.

00:19:55.920 --> 00:20:00.610
And within that space is some
subset, some region or subset,

00:20:00.610 --> 00:20:03.670
somehow described that
is the set of tufas.

00:20:03.670 --> 00:20:06.791
And somehow you're able to
grasp that subset, more or less,

00:20:06.791 --> 00:20:09.040
if you get its boundaries,
to be able to say yes or no

00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:10.770
as you did at the
beginning of the lecture

00:20:10.770 --> 00:20:13.030
from just, in this case, a
few points-- three points--

00:20:13.030 --> 00:20:15.809
randomly sampled from
somewhere in that region.

00:20:15.809 --> 00:20:18.100
It would work just as well
if I showed you one of them,

00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:19.210
basically.

00:20:19.210 --> 00:20:20.950
So in some sense,
it's the same problem.

00:20:20.950 --> 00:20:23.320
But it's much harder,
because here, the space

00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:24.970
was this one dimensional thing.

00:20:24.970 --> 00:20:26.344
It was just a number.

00:20:26.344 --> 00:20:27.760
Whereas here, we
don't know what's

00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:29.770
the dimensionality of
the space of objects.

00:20:29.770 --> 00:20:31.300
We don't know how to
describe the regions.

00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:32.380
Here we knew how to
describe the regions.

00:20:32.380 --> 00:20:34.460
They were just intervals
with a lower bound at zero

00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:35.860
and an upper bound at
some unknown thing.

00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:37.960
And the hypothesis space
of possible regions

00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:41.484
was just all the possible upper
bounds of this event duration.

00:20:41.484 --> 00:20:43.400
Here we don't know how
to describe this space.

00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:45.316
We don't know how to
describe the regions that

00:20:45.316 --> 00:20:47.650
correspond to object concepts.

00:20:47.650 --> 00:20:51.010
We don't know how to put a
price on those hypotheses.

00:20:51.010 --> 00:20:53.590
But in some work that
we did-- in particular,

00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:55.480
some work that I did
with Fei Xu, who is also

00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:56.920
a professor at Berkeley.

00:20:56.920 --> 00:21:00.070
We were colleagues and
friends in graduate school.

00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:02.320
We sort of did what
we could at the time.

00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:05.050
So we made some guesses about
what that hypothesis space--

00:21:05.050 --> 00:21:07.633
what that space might be like,
what the hypothesis space might

00:21:07.633 --> 00:21:09.826
be like, how to put some
priors, and so, on there.

00:21:09.826 --> 00:21:11.200
Used exactly the
same likelihood,

00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:14.260
which was just this very simple
idea that the observed examples

00:21:14.260 --> 00:21:18.010
are a uniform random draw
from some subset of the world.

00:21:18.010 --> 00:21:20.710
And you have to figure
out what that subset is.

00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:22.400
And we were able to
make some progress.

00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:25.750
So what we did was we said,
well, like in biology,

00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:28.570
perhaps-- and if you saw-- how
many people saw Surya Ganguli's

00:21:28.570 --> 00:21:30.970
lecture yesterday morning?

00:21:30.970 --> 00:21:32.925
Cool.

00:21:32.925 --> 00:21:35.710
I sort of tailored this for
assuming that you probably

00:21:35.710 --> 00:21:36.370
had seen that.

00:21:36.370 --> 00:21:40.617
Because there's a lot of
similarities, or parallels,

00:21:40.617 --> 00:21:41.200
which is neat.

00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:43.660
And it's, again, part of
engaging on generative models

00:21:43.660 --> 00:21:44.980
and neural networks.

00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:47.410
As you saw him do, you'll
get my version of this.

00:21:47.410 --> 00:21:50.530
So also, like he
mentioned, there

00:21:50.530 --> 00:21:54.310
are actual processes in the
world which generate objects--

00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:56.530
something like this.

00:21:56.530 --> 00:21:58.180
We know about evolution--

00:21:58.180 --> 00:22:01.220
produces basically
tree-structured groups,

00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:04.420
which we call species, or genus,
or something like that, or just

00:22:04.420 --> 00:22:05.350
taxa, or something.

00:22:05.350 --> 00:22:06.970
There's groups of
organisms that have

00:22:06.970 --> 00:22:08.560
a common evolutionary descent.

00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:11.000
That's the way a biologist
might describe it.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:14.140
And we know, these days,
a lot about the mechanisms

00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:15.490
that produce that.

00:22:15.490 --> 00:22:18.340
Even going back
100 or 200 years,

00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:19.997
say, to Darwin,
we knew something

00:22:19.997 --> 00:22:21.580
about the mechanisms
that produced it,

00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:24.100
even if we didn't know
the genetic details, ideas

00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:27.400
of something like mutation,
variation, natural selection

00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:28.900
as a kind of
mechanistic account,

00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:31.080
about right up there
with Newton and forces.

00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:33.666
But anyway, scientists
can describe some process

00:22:33.666 --> 00:22:34.540
that generates trees.

00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:36.160
And maybe people
have some intuition,

00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:37.870
just like people seem
to have some intuitions

00:22:37.870 --> 00:22:39.620
about these statistics
of everyday events,

00:22:39.620 --> 00:22:41.530
maybe they have some
intuitions, somehow,

00:22:41.530 --> 00:22:43.990
about the causal processes
in the world, which

00:22:43.990 --> 00:22:47.730
give rise to groups and
groups and subgroups.

00:22:47.730 --> 00:22:50.290
And they can use that to
set up a hypothesis space.

00:22:50.290 --> 00:22:52.180
And the way we
went about this is,

00:22:52.180 --> 00:22:55.145
we have no idea how to describe
people's internal mental models

00:22:55.145 --> 00:22:57.020
of these things, but
you can do some simple--

00:22:57.020 --> 00:22:59.410
there are simple ways
to get this picture

00:22:59.410 --> 00:23:02.084
by just basically asking
people to judge similarity

00:23:02.084 --> 00:23:03.500
and doing hierarchical
clustering.

00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:06.880
So this is a tree that we built
up by just asking people--

00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:08.680
getting some subjective
similarity metric

00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:11.470
and then doing hierarchical
clustering, which we thought

00:23:11.470 --> 00:23:13.990
could roughly approximate
maybe the internal hierarchy

00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:15.604
that our mental
models impose on this.

00:23:15.604 --> 00:23:17.270
Were you raising your
hand or just-- no.

00:23:17.270 --> 00:23:17.540
OK.

00:23:17.540 --> 00:23:18.040
Cool.

00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:22.570
We ultimately found
this dissatisfying,

00:23:22.570 --> 00:23:24.190
because we don't really
know what the features are.

00:23:24.190 --> 00:23:25.810
We don't really know if
this is the right tree

00:23:25.810 --> 00:23:27.130
or how people built it up.

00:23:27.130 --> 00:23:28.630
But it actually
worked pretty well,

00:23:28.630 --> 00:23:30.546
in the sense that we
could build up this tree.

00:23:30.546 --> 00:23:33.550
We could then assume that
the hypotheses for concepts

00:23:33.550 --> 00:23:36.430
just corresponded to
branches of the tree.

00:23:36.430 --> 00:23:37.984
And then you could--

00:23:37.984 --> 00:23:39.400
again, to put it
just intuitively,

00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:41.733
the way you do this learning
from one or a few examples,

00:23:41.733 --> 00:23:44.230
let's say that you see
those few tufas over there.

00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:46.960
You're basically asking,
which branch of the tree

00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:50.470
do I think-- those are randomly
drawn from some internal branch

00:23:50.470 --> 00:23:52.360
of the tree, some subtree.

00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:53.440
Which subtree is it?

00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:55.690
And intuitively, if you see
those things and you say,

00:23:55.690 --> 00:23:57.820
well, they are randomly
drawn from some branch,

00:23:57.820 --> 00:24:00.190
maybe it's the one
that I've circled.

00:24:00.190 --> 00:24:03.670
That sounds like a better bet,
for example, than this one

00:24:03.670 --> 00:24:05.710
here, or maybe this
one, which would

00:24:05.710 --> 00:24:07.870
include one of these
things, but not the others.

00:24:07.870 --> 00:24:10.092
So that's probably unlikely.

00:24:10.092 --> 00:24:11.800
And it's probably a
better bet than, say,

00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:14.230
this branch, or this branch, or
these ones, which are logically

00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:16.300
compatible, but somehow
it would have been sort

00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:18.490
of a suspicious coincidence.

00:24:18.490 --> 00:24:21.799
If the set of tufas had
really been this branch here,

00:24:21.799 --> 00:24:24.340
or this one here, then it would
have been quite a coincidence

00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:25.881
that the first three
examples you saw

00:24:25.881 --> 00:24:28.490
were all clustered over
there in one corner.

00:24:28.490 --> 00:24:32.310
And what we showed was
that, that kind of model,

00:24:32.310 --> 00:24:34.060
where that suspicious
coincidence came out

00:24:34.060 --> 00:24:35.260
from the same kinds
of things I've just

00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:37.720
been showing you for the
causal clustering example,

00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:40.407
and for the interval thing,
it's the same Bayesian math.

00:24:40.407 --> 00:24:42.240
But now with this
tree-structured hypothesis

00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:44.530
space, that was actually--
did a pretty good job

00:24:44.530 --> 00:24:46.060
of capturing people's judgments.

00:24:46.060 --> 00:24:49.050
We gave people one or a few
examples of these concepts

00:24:49.050 --> 00:24:51.550
that, the examples could be
more narrowly or broadly spread,

00:24:51.550 --> 00:24:53.560
just like you saw in
the clustering thing,

00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:56.010
but just sort of less extensive.

00:24:56.010 --> 00:24:57.010
We did this with adults.

00:24:57.010 --> 00:24:57.929
We did this with kids.

00:24:57.929 --> 00:24:59.845
And I won't really go
into any of the details.

00:24:59.845 --> 00:25:02.400
but If you're interested,
check out these various Xu

00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:03.300
and Tenenbaum papers.

00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:04.766
That's the main one there.

00:25:04.766 --> 00:25:06.390
And you know, the
model kind of worked.

00:25:06.390 --> 00:25:08.130
But ultimately, we
found it dissatisfying.

00:25:08.130 --> 00:25:09.510
Because we couldn't
really explain--

00:25:09.510 --> 00:25:11.270
we didn't really know what
the hypothesis space was.

00:25:11.270 --> 00:25:13.769
We didn't really know how people
were building up this tree.

00:25:13.769 --> 00:25:15.660
And so we did a few things.

00:25:15.660 --> 00:25:17.850
We-- meaning I with
some other people--

00:25:17.850 --> 00:25:20.404
turned to other problems where
we had a better idea, maybe,

00:25:20.404 --> 00:25:22.320
of the feature space and
the hypothesis space,

00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:24.990
but the same kind of ideas
could be explored and developed.

00:25:24.990 --> 00:25:28.830
And then ultimately-- and I'll
show you this maybe before

00:25:28.830 --> 00:25:30.436
lunch, or maybe after lunch--

00:25:30.436 --> 00:25:32.810
we went back and tackled the
problem of learning concepts

00:25:32.810 --> 00:25:36.810
from examples with other cases
where we could get a better

00:25:36.810 --> 00:25:39.960
handle on really knowing what
the representations that people

00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:43.350
were using were, and also where
we could compare with machines

00:25:43.350 --> 00:25:45.840
in much more compelling
apples and oranges ways.

00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:48.600
In some sense here, there's
no machine, as far as I know,

00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:51.270
that can solve this problem
as well as our model.

00:25:51.270 --> 00:25:53.220
On the other hand,
that's, again, it's

00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:54.570
just very much like
the issue that came up

00:25:54.570 --> 00:25:55.710
when we were talking about--

00:25:55.710 --> 00:25:56.930
I guess maybe it was
with you, Tyler--

00:25:56.930 --> 00:25:58.980
when we were talking about the
deep learning-- or with you,

00:25:58.980 --> 00:25:59.690
Leo--

00:25:59.690 --> 00:26:01.810
the deep reinforcement network.

00:26:01.810 --> 00:26:05.010
A machine that's looking
at this just as pixels

00:26:05.010 --> 00:26:06.810
is missing so much
of what we bring

00:26:06.810 --> 00:26:08.310
to it, which is,
we see these things

00:26:08.310 --> 00:26:10.240
as three-dimensional objects.

00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:13.309
And just like the
cam in rock climbing,

00:26:13.309 --> 00:26:14.850
or any of those
other examples I gave

00:26:14.850 --> 00:26:17.414
before, I think that's
essential to the abilities

00:26:17.414 --> 00:26:18.330
that people are doing.

00:26:18.330 --> 00:26:20.430
The generative model
we build, this tree

00:26:20.430 --> 00:26:23.171
is based not on pixels, or
even on ConvNet features,

00:26:23.171 --> 00:26:25.170
but on a sense of the
three-dimensional objects,

00:26:25.170 --> 00:26:27.610
its parts, and their
relations to each other.

00:26:27.610 --> 00:26:30.660
And so, fundamentally, until
we know how to perceive objects

00:26:30.660 --> 00:26:34.290
better, this is not going to
be comparable between humans

00:26:34.290 --> 00:26:36.030
and machines on equal terms.

00:26:36.030 --> 00:26:37.530
But I'll show you
a little bit later

00:26:37.530 --> 00:26:39.600
some still pretty quite
interesting, but simpler,

00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:42.000
visual concepts that you can
still learn and generalize

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:46.050
from one example, but where they
are comparable in equal terms.

00:26:46.050 --> 00:26:48.960
But first I want to tell you
a little bit about these--

00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:50.670
yet another cognitive
judgment, which

00:26:50.670 --> 00:26:52.800
like the word learning,
or concept learning cases,

00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:55.110
involved generalizing
from a few examples.

00:26:55.110 --> 00:26:56.850
They also involve
using prior knowledge.

00:26:56.850 --> 00:26:58.350
But they're ones
where maybe we have

00:26:58.350 --> 00:27:01.290
some way of capturing people's
prior knowledge by using

00:27:01.290 --> 00:27:04.380
the right combination
of statistical inference

00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:06.560
on some kind of symbolically
structured bottle.

00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:08.070
So you can already see, as--

00:27:08.070 --> 00:27:12.010
I mean, just sort of to
show the narrative here.

00:27:12.010 --> 00:27:14.670
The examples I was
giving here, this

00:27:14.670 --> 00:27:16.370
doesn't require any
symbolic structure.

00:27:16.370 --> 00:27:17.730
All that stuff I was
talking at the beginning,

00:27:17.730 --> 00:27:19.856
about how we have to combine
statistical inference,

00:27:19.856 --> 00:27:21.355
sophisticated
statistical inference,

00:27:21.355 --> 00:27:23.250
with sophisticated
symbolic representations,

00:27:23.250 --> 00:27:24.594
you don't need any of that here.

00:27:24.594 --> 00:27:26.010
All the representations
could just

00:27:26.010 --> 00:27:29.010
be counting up numbers or
using simple probability

00:27:29.010 --> 00:27:30.600
distributions that
statisticians have

00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:33.600
worked with for over 100 years.

00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:35.477
Once we start to go
here, now we have

00:27:35.477 --> 00:27:37.560
to define a model with
some interesting structure,

00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:41.510
like a branching tree
structure, and so on.

00:27:41.510 --> 00:27:43.410
And as you'll see,
we can quickly

00:27:43.410 --> 00:27:45.360
get to lots more
interesting causal,

00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:48.870
compositionally-structured
generative models

00:27:48.870 --> 00:27:50.220
in similar kinds of tasks.

00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:52.300
And in particular,
we were looking for--

00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:54.150
for a few years, we
were very interested

00:27:54.150 --> 00:27:55.950
in these property
induction tasks.

00:27:55.950 --> 00:27:57.480
So this was-- it
happened to be--

00:27:57.480 --> 00:27:59.105
I mean, I think this
was a coincidence.

00:27:59.105 --> 00:28:01.680
Or maybe we were both influenced
by Susan Carey, actually.

00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:04.950
So the work that Surya talked
about, that he was trying

00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:06.910
to explain as a
theoretician-- remember,

00:28:06.910 --> 00:28:09.330
Surya and Andrew
Saxe, they were trying

00:28:09.330 --> 00:28:12.030
to give the theory of
these neural network

00:28:12.030 --> 00:28:13.620
models that Jay
McClelland and Tim

00:28:13.620 --> 00:28:15.510
Rogers had built
in the early 2000s,

00:28:15.510 --> 00:28:17.940
around the same time we
were doing this work.

00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:20.280
And they were inspired by
some of Susan Carey's work

00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:22.560
on children's intuitive
biology, as well as

00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:25.140
other people out there
in cognitive psychology--

00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:31.770
for example, Lance
Rips, and Smith, Madine.

00:28:31.770 --> 00:28:33.720
Many, many cognitive
psychologists

00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:35.100
studied things like this--

00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:37.765
Dan Osherson.

00:28:37.765 --> 00:28:40.440
They often talked about this as
a kind of inductive reasoning,

00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:42.826
or property induction,
where the idea was--

00:28:42.826 --> 00:28:45.450
so it might look different from
the task I've given you before,

00:28:45.450 --> 00:28:48.875
but actually, it's
deeply related.

00:28:48.875 --> 00:28:53.340
The task was often presented
to people like an argument

00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:54.870
with premises and
a conclusion, kind

00:28:54.870 --> 00:28:57.960
of like a traditional deductive
syllogism, like all men are

00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:00.769
mortal, Socrates is a man,
therefore Socrates is mortal.

00:29:00.769 --> 00:29:02.310
But these are
inductive in that there

00:29:02.310 --> 00:29:06.210
is no-- you can't conclude
with deductive certainty

00:29:06.210 --> 00:29:08.010
the conclusion follows
from the premises

00:29:08.010 --> 00:29:10.290
or is falsified by the
premise, but rather you just

00:29:10.290 --> 00:29:11.480
make a good guess.

00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:15.060
The statements above the line
provide some, more or less,

00:29:15.060 --> 00:29:16.980
good or bad evidence
for the statement

00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:19.545
below the line being true.

00:29:19.545 --> 00:29:22.200
These studies were
often done with-- they

00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:25.920
could be done with just sort of
familiar biological properties,

00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:30.565
like having hairy legs or
being bigger than a breadbox.

00:29:30.565 --> 00:29:32.940
I mean, it's also-- it's very
much the same kind of thing

00:29:32.940 --> 00:29:35.800
that Tom Mitchell was talking
about, as you'll start to see.

00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:38.221
There's another reason why
I wanted to cover this.

00:29:38.221 --> 00:29:39.720
We worked on these
things because we

00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:42.095
wanted to be able to engage
with the same kinds of things

00:29:42.095 --> 00:29:44.100
that people like Jay
McClelland and Tom Mitchell

00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:46.180
were thinking about, coming
from different perspectives.

00:29:46.180 --> 00:29:47.610
Remember, Tom
Mitchell showed you

00:29:47.610 --> 00:29:52.710
his way of classifying brain
representations of semantics

00:29:52.710 --> 00:29:56.550
with matrices of objects and
20-question-like features that

00:29:56.550 --> 00:29:58.920
included things like is
it hairy, or is it alive,

00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:03.020
or does it eggs, or is
it bigger than a car,

00:30:03.020 --> 00:30:06.190
or bigger than a
breadbox, or whatever.

00:30:06.190 --> 00:30:07.910
Any one of these things--

00:30:07.910 --> 00:30:09.960
basically, we're getting
at the same thing.

00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:11.510
Here there's just what's--

00:30:11.510 --> 00:30:13.010
often these
experiments with humans

00:30:13.010 --> 00:30:15.176
were done with so-called
blank predicates, something

00:30:15.176 --> 00:30:17.840
that sounded vaguely biological,
but was basically made up,

00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:19.850
or that most people
wouldn't know much about.

00:30:19.850 --> 00:30:22.220
Does anyone know anything
about T9 hormones?

00:30:22.220 --> 00:30:24.299
I hope so, because I made it up.

00:30:24.299 --> 00:30:26.090
But some of them were
just done with things

00:30:26.090 --> 00:30:28.740
that were real, but not
known to most people.

00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:31.072
So if I tell you that
gorillas and seals both have

00:30:31.072 --> 00:30:33.530
T9 hormones, you might think
it's sort of, fairly plausible

00:30:33.530 --> 00:30:35.738
that horses have T9 hormones,
maybe more so than if I

00:30:35.738 --> 00:30:38.060
hadn't told you anything.

00:30:38.060 --> 00:30:40.010
Maybe you think that
argument is more

00:30:40.010 --> 00:30:41.990
plausible than the one
on the right; given

00:30:41.990 --> 00:30:45.007
that gorillas and seals have
T9 or hormones, that anteaters

00:30:45.007 --> 00:30:45.590
have hormones.

00:30:45.590 --> 00:30:48.020
So maybe you think
horses are somehow

00:30:48.020 --> 00:30:50.629
more similar to gorillas and
seals than anteaters are.

00:30:50.629 --> 00:30:51.170
I don't know.

00:30:51.170 --> 00:30:51.670
Maybe.

00:30:51.670 --> 00:30:52.670
Maybe a little bit.

00:30:52.670 --> 00:30:54.020
If I made that bees--

00:30:54.020 --> 00:30:56.305
gorillas and seals
have T9 on hormones.

00:30:56.305 --> 00:30:58.430
Does that make you think
it's likely that bees have

00:30:58.430 --> 00:31:02.030
T9 hormones, or pine trees?

00:31:02.030 --> 00:31:03.620
The farther the
conclusion category

00:31:03.620 --> 00:31:06.620
gets from the premises, the
less plausible it seems.

00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:09.260
Maybe the one on the lower right
also seems not very plausible,

00:31:09.260 --> 00:31:10.652
or not as plausible.

00:31:10.652 --> 00:31:12.110
Because if I tell
you that gorillas

00:31:12.110 --> 00:31:14.240
have T9 hormones, chimps,
monkeys, and baboons

00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:16.130
all have T9 on
hormones, maybe you

00:31:16.130 --> 00:31:18.140
think that it's only
primates or something.

00:31:18.140 --> 00:31:19.640
So they're not a
very-- it's, again,

00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:21.140
one of these
typicality-suspicious

00:31:21.140 --> 00:31:23.750
coincidence businesses.

00:31:23.750 --> 00:31:25.670
So again, you can
think of it as-- you

00:31:25.670 --> 00:31:27.380
can do these experiments
in various ways.

00:31:27.380 --> 00:31:28.963
I won't really go
through the details,

00:31:28.963 --> 00:31:30.770
but it basically
involves giving people

00:31:30.770 --> 00:31:33.229
a bunch of different sets
of examples, just like--

00:31:33.229 --> 00:31:35.270
I mean, in some sense,
the important thing to get

00:31:35.270 --> 00:31:37.160
is that abstractly it has
the same character of all

00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:38.420
the other tasks you've seen.

00:31:38.420 --> 00:31:40.820
You're giving people one or
a few examples, which we're

00:31:40.820 --> 00:31:44.150
going to treat as random
draws from some concept,

00:31:44.150 --> 00:31:46.940
or some region in
some larger space.

00:31:46.940 --> 00:31:49.400
In this case, the examples
are the different premise

00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:51.200
categories, like
gorillas and seals

00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:55.280
are examples of the concept
of having T9 hormones.

00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:57.310
Or gorillas, chimps,
monkeys, and baboons

00:31:57.310 --> 00:31:58.880
are an example of a concept.

00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:01.460
We're going to put a
prior on possible extents

00:32:01.460 --> 00:32:04.430
of that concept, and then
ask what kind of inferences

00:32:04.430 --> 00:32:06.867
people make from that
prior, to figure out

00:32:06.867 --> 00:32:08.450
what other things
are in that concept.

00:32:08.450 --> 00:32:11.630
So are horses in
that same concept?

00:32:11.630 --> 00:32:12.382
Or are anteaters?

00:32:12.382 --> 00:32:14.840
Or are horses in it more or
less, depending on the examples

00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:15.470
you give?

00:32:15.470 --> 00:32:17.750
And what's the
nature of that prior?

00:32:17.750 --> 00:32:19.820
And what's good
about this is that,

00:32:19.820 --> 00:32:24.740
kind of like the everyday
prediction task--

00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:27.290
the lines of the poems, or
the movie grosses, or the cake

00:32:27.290 --> 00:32:29.210
baking-- we can actually
sort of go out and measure

00:32:29.210 --> 00:32:30.960
some features that are
plausibly relevant,

00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:33.200
to set up a plausibly
relevant prior,

00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:36.860
unlike the interesting
object cases.

00:32:36.860 --> 00:32:38.829
But like the interesting
object cases,

00:32:38.829 --> 00:32:41.120
there are some interesting
hierarchical and other kinds

00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:42.740
of causal compositional
structures

00:32:42.740 --> 00:32:44.360
that people seem
to be using that we

00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:46.680
can capture in our models.

00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:50.240
So here, again, the kinds of
experiments-- these features

00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:54.220
were generated many years ago
by Osherson and colleagues.

00:32:54.220 --> 00:32:56.270
But it's very similar
to the 20 questions game

00:32:56.270 --> 00:32:57.290
that Tom Mitchell used.

00:32:57.290 --> 00:32:58.820
And I don't remember
if Surya talked

00:32:58.820 --> 00:33:00.230
about where these
features came from,

00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:02.570
that he talked a lot about a
matrix of objects and features.

00:33:02.570 --> 00:33:04.778
I don't know if he talked
about where they come from.

00:33:04.778 --> 00:33:07.250
But actually, psychologists
spent a while coming up

00:33:07.250 --> 00:33:09.110
with ways to get
people to just tell you

00:33:09.110 --> 00:33:10.820
a bunch of features of animals.

00:33:10.820 --> 00:33:13.790
This is, again, it's meant
to capture the knowledge

00:33:13.790 --> 00:33:17.210
that maybe a kid would get
from maybe plausibly reading

00:33:17.210 --> 00:33:18.700
books and going to the zoo.

00:33:18.700 --> 00:33:20.042
We know that elephants are gray.

00:33:20.042 --> 00:33:20.750
They're hairless.

00:33:20.750 --> 00:33:21.590
They have tough skin.

00:33:21.590 --> 00:33:22.100
They're big.

00:33:22.100 --> 00:33:24.740
They have a bulbous body shape.

00:33:24.740 --> 00:33:25.642
They have long legs.

00:33:25.642 --> 00:33:27.600
These are all mostly
relative to other animals.

00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:28.910
They have a tail.

00:33:28.910 --> 00:33:29.580
They have tusks.

00:33:29.580 --> 00:33:31.639
They might be smelly,
compared to other animals--

00:33:31.639 --> 00:33:33.680
smellier than average is
sort of what that means.

00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:35.130
They walk, as opposed to fly.

00:33:35.130 --> 00:33:36.752
They're slow, as
opposed to fast.

00:33:36.752 --> 00:33:38.210
They're strong, as
opposed to weak.

00:33:38.210 --> 00:33:39.644
It's that kind of business.

00:33:39.644 --> 00:33:41.810
So basically what that gives
you is this big matrix.

00:33:41.810 --> 00:33:43.393
Again, the same kind
of thing that you

00:33:43.393 --> 00:33:46.130
saw in Surya's talk,
the same kind of thing

00:33:46.130 --> 00:33:47.750
that Tom Mitchell
is using to help

00:33:47.750 --> 00:33:49.130
classify things, the
same kind of thing

00:33:49.130 --> 00:33:50.963
that basically everybody
in machine learning

00:33:50.963 --> 00:33:55.190
uses-- a matrix of data
with objects, maybe as rows,

00:33:55.190 --> 00:33:57.530
and features, or
attributes, as columns.

00:33:57.530 --> 00:33:59.330
And the problem here is--

00:33:59.330 --> 00:34:02.145
the problem of
learning is to say--

00:34:02.145 --> 00:34:04.520
the problem of learning and
generalizing from one example

00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:06.920
is to take a new property,
which is a new concept, which

00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:08.810
is like a new
column here, to get

00:34:08.810 --> 00:34:11.659
one or a few examples of that
concept, which is basically

00:34:11.659 --> 00:34:14.600
just filling in one or a
few entries in that column,

00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:16.850
and figure out how to fill
in the others, to decide,

00:34:16.850 --> 00:34:19.790
do you or don't you have
that property, somehow

00:34:19.790 --> 00:34:21.800
building knowledge
that you can generalize

00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:24.080
from your prior
experience, which

00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:26.360
could be captured by, say,
all the other features

00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:27.780
that you know about objects.

00:34:27.780 --> 00:34:29.405
So that's the way
that you might set up

00:34:29.405 --> 00:34:32.030
this problem, which again, looks
like a lot of other problems

00:34:32.030 --> 00:34:34.550
of, say, semi-supervised
learning or sparse matrix

00:34:34.550 --> 00:34:35.189
completion.

00:34:35.189 --> 00:34:36.980
It's a problem in which
we can, or at least

00:34:36.980 --> 00:34:38.592
we thought we could,
compare humans

00:34:38.592 --> 00:34:40.550
and many different
algorithms, and even theory,

00:34:40.550 --> 00:34:42.020
like from Surya's talk.

00:34:42.020 --> 00:34:43.760
And that seemed very
appealing to us.

00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:45.480
What we thought, though,
that people were doing,

00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:47.355
which is maybe a little
different than what--

00:34:47.355 --> 00:34:49.940
or somewhat different-- well,
quite different than what Jay

00:34:49.940 --> 00:34:51.199
McClelland thought
people were doing--

00:34:51.199 --> 00:34:53.389
maybe a little bit more like
what Susan Carey or some

00:34:53.389 --> 00:34:55.722
of the earlier psychologists
thought people were doing--

00:34:55.722 --> 00:34:57.110
was something like this.

00:34:57.110 --> 00:34:59.890
That the way we
solve this problem,

00:34:59.890 --> 00:35:02.380
the way we bridged from our
prior experience to new things

00:35:02.380 --> 00:35:06.860
we wanted to learn was
not, say, by just computing

00:35:06.860 --> 00:35:08.860
the second order of
statistics and correlations,

00:35:08.860 --> 00:35:11.276
and compressing that through
some bottleneck hidden layer,

00:35:11.276 --> 00:35:12.970
but by building a
more interesting

00:35:12.970 --> 00:35:15.850
structured probabilistic
model that was, in some form,

00:35:15.850 --> 00:35:16.450
causal--

00:35:16.450 --> 00:35:18.640
in some form-- in some
form, compositional

00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:22.140
and hierarchical--
something kind of like this.

00:35:22.140 --> 00:35:26.800
And this is a good example of a
hierarchical generative model.

00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:29.110
There's three layers
of structure here.

00:35:29.110 --> 00:35:31.620
The bottom layer is
the observable layer.

00:35:31.620 --> 00:35:34.510
So the arrows in these
generative models point down,

00:35:34.510 --> 00:35:37.750
often, usually, where the thing
on the bottom is the thing

00:35:37.750 --> 00:35:39.820
you observe, the data
of your experience.

00:35:39.820 --> 00:35:42.460
And then the stuff above it
are various levels of structure

00:35:42.460 --> 00:35:45.440
that your mind is
positing to explain it.

00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:47.230
So here we have two
levels of structure.

00:35:47.230 --> 00:35:50.590
The level above this is sort
of this tree in your head.

00:35:50.590 --> 00:35:54.130
The idea-- it's like a certain
kind of graph structure,

00:35:54.130 --> 00:35:56.654
where the objects, or the
species, are the leaf nodes.

00:35:56.654 --> 00:35:58.570
And there's some internal
nodes corresponding,

00:35:58.570 --> 00:36:00.760
maybe to higher level taxa,
or groups, or something.

00:36:00.760 --> 00:36:02.860
You might have words for
these, too, like mammal,

00:36:02.860 --> 00:36:04.930
or primate, or animal.

00:36:04.930 --> 00:36:07.000
And the idea is that
there's some kind

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:08.890
of probabilistic model
that you can describe,

00:36:08.890 --> 00:36:12.070
maybe even a causal one on top
of that symbolic structure,

00:36:12.070 --> 00:36:16.000
that tree, that produces the
data that's more directly

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:17.622
observable, the
observable features,

00:36:17.622 --> 00:36:19.330
including the things
you've only sparsely

00:36:19.330 --> 00:36:20.867
observed and want to fill in.

00:36:20.867 --> 00:36:23.200
And then you might also have
higher levels of structure.

00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:24.970
Like if you want to
explain, how did you

00:36:24.970 --> 00:36:27.080
learn that tree in
the first place,

00:36:27.080 --> 00:36:29.957
maybe it's because you have
some kind of generative model

00:36:29.957 --> 00:36:31.040
for that generative model.

00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:32.680
So here I'm just using
words to describe it,

00:36:32.680 --> 00:36:34.388
but I'll show you some
other stuff in a--

00:36:34.388 --> 00:36:37.600
or I'll show you something
more formal a little bit later.

00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:40.120
But you could say,
well, maybe the way

00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:42.100
I figure out that there's
a tree structure is

00:36:42.100 --> 00:36:44.206
by having a hypothesis--

00:36:44.206 --> 00:36:45.580
the way I figure
out that there's

00:36:45.580 --> 00:36:49.480
that particular tree-structured
graphical model of this domain

00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:51.520
is by having the more
general hypothesis

00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:54.310
that there is some latent
hierarchy of species.

00:36:54.310 --> 00:36:57.040
And I just have to figure
out which one it is.

00:36:57.040 --> 00:36:59.380
So you could formulate this
as a hierarchical inference

00:36:59.380 --> 00:37:00.940
by saying that
what we're calling

00:37:00.940 --> 00:37:02.500
the form, the form
of the model, it's

00:37:02.500 --> 00:37:05.230
like a hypothesis space of
models, which are themselves

00:37:05.230 --> 00:37:08.890
hypothesis spaces of possible
observed patterns of feature

00:37:08.890 --> 00:37:10.060
correlation.

00:37:10.060 --> 00:37:11.860
And that, that higher
level knowledge,

00:37:11.860 --> 00:37:14.020
puts some kind of a generative
model on these graph

00:37:14.020 --> 00:37:15.910
structures, where each
graph structure then

00:37:15.910 --> 00:37:17.830
puts a generative model on
the data you can observe.

00:37:17.830 --> 00:37:19.210
And then you could
have even higher levels

00:37:19.210 --> 00:37:20.080
of this sort of thing.

00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:22.180
And then learning could
go on at any or all levels

00:37:22.180 --> 00:37:25.399
of this hierarchy, higher
than the level of experience.

00:37:25.399 --> 00:37:27.940
So just to show you a little
bit about how this kind of thing

00:37:27.940 --> 00:37:31.870
works, what we're calling
the probability of the data

00:37:31.870 --> 00:37:34.420
given the structure is actually
exactly the same, really,

00:37:34.420 --> 00:37:37.300
as the model that Surya
and Andrew Saxe used.

00:37:37.300 --> 00:37:40.960
The difference is that
we were suggesting--

00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:42.642
may be right, may be wrong--

00:37:42.642 --> 00:37:44.350
that something like
this generative model

00:37:44.350 --> 00:37:46.655
was actually in your head.

00:37:46.655 --> 00:37:49.270
Surya presented a very
simple abstraction

00:37:49.270 --> 00:37:52.480
of evolutionary branching
process, a kind of diffusion

00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:54.940
over the tree, where properties
could turn on or off.

00:37:54.940 --> 00:37:57.700
And we built basically
that same kind of model.

00:37:57.700 --> 00:38:00.880
And we said, maybe you
have something in your head

00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:05.230
as a model of, again, the
distribution of properties,

00:38:05.230 --> 00:38:08.630
or features, or attributes over
the leaf nodes of the tree.

00:38:08.630 --> 00:38:11.222
So if you have this kind
of statistical model.

00:38:11.222 --> 00:38:13.180
If you think that there's
something like a tree

00:38:13.180 --> 00:38:16.990
structure, and properties are
produced over the leaf nodes

00:38:16.990 --> 00:38:19.739
by some kind of switching,
on-and-off, mutation-like

00:38:19.739 --> 00:38:22.030
process, then you can do
something like in this picture

00:38:22.030 --> 00:38:22.530
here.

00:38:22.530 --> 00:38:25.030
You can take an observe a set
of features in that matrix

00:38:25.030 --> 00:38:26.440
and learn the best tree.

00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:28.760
You can figure out that
thing I'm showing on the top,

00:38:28.760 --> 00:38:30.970
that structure, which is,
in some sense, the best

00:38:30.970 --> 00:38:34.000
guess of a tree structure-- a
latent tree structure-- which

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:37.060
if you then define some
kind of diffusion mutation

00:38:37.060 --> 00:38:40.810
process over that tree, would
produce with high probability

00:38:40.810 --> 00:38:43.930
distributions of features
like those shown there.

00:38:43.930 --> 00:38:45.460
If I gave you a
very different tree

00:38:45.460 --> 00:38:47.450
it would produce other
patterns of correlation.

00:38:47.450 --> 00:38:48.927
And it's just like
Surya said, it

00:38:48.927 --> 00:38:51.010
can be all captured by the
second order statistics

00:38:51.010 --> 00:38:52.420
of feature correlations.

00:38:52.420 --> 00:38:54.190
The nice thing about
this is that now this

00:38:54.190 --> 00:38:56.420
also gives a distribution
on new properties.

00:38:56.420 --> 00:38:57.280
So if I observe--

00:38:57.280 --> 00:38:59.302
because each column is
conditionally independent

00:38:59.302 --> 00:39:00.010
given that model.

00:39:00.010 --> 00:39:01.690
Each column is an
independent sample

00:39:01.690 --> 00:39:04.400
from that generative model.

00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:06.340
And the idea is if I
observe a new property,

00:39:06.340 --> 00:39:08.840
and I want to say, well, which
other things have this, well,

00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:11.740
I can make a guess on using
that probabilistic model.

00:39:11.740 --> 00:39:14.020
I can say, all
right, given that I

00:39:14.020 --> 00:39:16.180
know the value of this
function over the tree,

00:39:16.180 --> 00:39:18.851
this stochastic process,
at some points, what

00:39:18.851 --> 00:39:21.100
do I think the most likely
values are at other points?

00:39:21.100 --> 00:39:23.599
And basically, what you get is,
again, like in the diffusion

00:39:23.599 --> 00:39:25.750
process, a kind of
similarity-based generalization

00:39:25.750 --> 00:39:28.960
with a tree-structured metric,
that nearby points in the tree

00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:30.450
are likely to have
the same value.

00:39:30.450 --> 00:39:33.077
So in particular, things that
are near to, say, species one

00:39:33.077 --> 00:39:35.326
and nine are probably going
to have the same property,

00:39:35.326 --> 00:39:36.640
and others maybe less so.

00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:38.150
And you build that model.

00:39:38.150 --> 00:39:40.000
And it's really quite
striking how much

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:41.292
it matches people's intuitions.

00:39:41.292 --> 00:39:43.666
So now you're seeing the kinds
of plots I was showing you

00:39:43.666 --> 00:39:44.350
before, where--

00:39:44.350 --> 00:39:46.060
all my data plots
look like this.

00:39:46.060 --> 00:39:48.310
Whenever I'm showing the
scatterplot, by default,

00:39:48.310 --> 00:39:52.300
the y-axis is the average of
a bunch of people's judgments,

00:39:52.300 --> 00:39:55.660
and the x-axis is the model
predictions on the same units

00:39:55.660 --> 00:39:56.950
or scale.

00:39:56.950 --> 00:39:58.330
And each of these
scatterplots is

00:39:58.330 --> 00:40:00.090
from a different
experiment-- not done

00:40:00.090 --> 00:40:02.610
by us, done by other people,
like Osherson and Smith

00:40:02.610 --> 00:40:03.840
from a couple of decades ago.

00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:08.460
But they all sort of have
the same kind of form,

00:40:08.460 --> 00:40:10.800
where each dot is a
different set of examples,

00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:12.160
or a different argument.

00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:14.550
And what typically varied
within an experiment--

00:40:14.550 --> 00:40:15.750
you vary the examples.

00:40:15.750 --> 00:40:18.810
And you fix constant
the conclusion category.

00:40:18.810 --> 00:40:21.240
And you see, basically,
how much evidential support

00:40:21.240 --> 00:40:23.130
to different sets of
two or three examples

00:40:23.130 --> 00:40:25.200
gives to a certain conclusion.

00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:27.480
And it's really, again,
quite striking that--

00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:29.070
sometimes in a more
categorical way,

00:40:29.070 --> 00:40:31.110
sometimes in a more graded
way-- but basically,

00:40:31.110 --> 00:40:32.820
people's average
judgments here just

00:40:32.820 --> 00:40:37.950
line up quite well with the
sort of Bayesian inference

00:40:37.950 --> 00:40:41.190
on this tree-structured
generative model.

00:40:41.190 --> 00:40:45.120
These are just examples of
the kinds of stimuli here.

00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:46.080
Now, we can compare.

00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:47.280
One of the reasons
why we were interested

00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:49.654
in this was to compare, again,
many different approaches.

00:40:49.654 --> 00:40:52.110
So here I'm going to show
you a comparison with just

00:40:52.110 --> 00:40:53.340
a variant of our approach.

00:40:53.340 --> 00:40:55.710
It's the same kind of
hierarchical Bayesian model,

00:40:55.710 --> 00:40:57.540
but now the structure
isn't a tree,

00:40:57.540 --> 00:41:00.360
it's a low-dimensional
Euclidean space.

00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:03.967
You can define the same kinds
of proximity smoothness thing.

00:41:03.967 --> 00:41:06.300
I mean, again, it's more a
standard in machine learning.

00:41:06.300 --> 00:41:10.500
It's related to
Gaussian processes.

00:41:10.500 --> 00:41:12.164
It's much more like
neural networks.

00:41:12.164 --> 00:41:14.580
You could think of this as
kind of like a Bayesian version

00:41:14.580 --> 00:41:17.430
of a bottleneck hidden
layer with two dimensions,

00:41:17.430 --> 00:41:18.930
or a small number of dimensions.

00:41:18.930 --> 00:41:21.974
The pictures that Surya showed
you were all higher dimensions

00:41:21.974 --> 00:41:23.640
than two dimensions
in the latent space,

00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:25.800
or the hidden variable
space, of the neural network,

00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:26.760
the hidden layer space.

00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:28.920
But when he compress it
down to two dimensions,

00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:31.090
it looks pretty good.

00:41:31.090 --> 00:41:32.340
So it's the same kind of idea.

00:41:32.340 --> 00:41:37.370
Now what you're saying
is you're going to find,

00:41:37.370 --> 00:41:39.600
not the best tree that
explains all these features,

00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:41.520
but the best
two-dimensional space.

00:41:41.520 --> 00:41:43.680
Maybe it looks like this.

00:41:43.680 --> 00:41:45.270
Where, again, the
probabilistic model

00:41:45.270 --> 00:41:47.594
says that things which are
relatively-- things that

00:41:47.594 --> 00:41:49.260
are closer in this
two-dimensional space

00:41:49.260 --> 00:41:51.218
are more likely to have
the same feature value.

00:41:51.218 --> 00:41:53.850
So you're basically explaining
all the pairwise feature

00:41:53.850 --> 00:41:57.340
correlations by
distance in this space.

00:41:57.340 --> 00:41:58.230
It's similar.

00:41:58.230 --> 00:42:01.890
Importantly it's not as
causal and compositional.

00:42:01.890 --> 00:42:04.770
The tree models something about,
possibly, the causal processes

00:42:04.770 --> 00:42:06.570
of how organisms come to be.

00:42:06.570 --> 00:42:08.870
If I told you that,
oh, there's this--

00:42:08.870 --> 00:42:13.315
that I told you about a
subspecies, like whatever--

00:42:13.315 --> 00:42:15.600
what's a good example--

00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:16.860
different breeds of dogs.

00:42:16.860 --> 00:42:20.310
Or I told you that, oh, well,
there's not just wolves,

00:42:20.310 --> 00:42:22.710
but there's the gray-tailed
wolf and the red-tailed wolf.

00:42:22.710 --> 00:42:23.376
Red-tailed wolf?

00:42:23.376 --> 00:42:23.940
I don't know.

00:42:23.940 --> 00:42:26.340
Again, they're probably
similar, but they might--

00:42:26.340 --> 00:42:28.452
one red-tailed wolf,
whatever that is, more

00:42:28.452 --> 00:42:29.910
similar to another
red-tailed wolf,

00:42:29.910 --> 00:42:31.409
probably has more
features in common

00:42:31.409 --> 00:42:33.420
than with a gray-tailed
wolf, and probably more

00:42:33.420 --> 00:42:35.004
to the gray-tailed
wolf than to a dog.

00:42:35.004 --> 00:42:37.461
The nice thing about a tree is
I can tell you these things,

00:42:37.461 --> 00:42:38.610
and you can, in your mind--

00:42:38.610 --> 00:42:40.530
maybe you'll never forget that
there's a red-tailed wolf.

00:42:40.530 --> 00:42:41.029
There isn't.

00:42:41.029 --> 00:42:41.920
I just made it up.

00:42:41.920 --> 00:42:44.677
But if you ever find
yourself thinking

00:42:44.677 --> 00:42:47.010
about red-tailed wolves and
whether their properties are

00:42:47.010 --> 00:42:50.040
more or less similar to each
other than to gray-tailed

00:42:50.040 --> 00:42:52.529
wolves, or less so
to dogs, or so on,

00:42:52.529 --> 00:42:54.070
it's because I just
said some things,

00:42:54.070 --> 00:42:55.736
and you grew out your
tree in your mind.

00:42:55.736 --> 00:43:00.187
That's a lot harder to do
in a low-dimensional space.

00:43:00.187 --> 00:43:01.770
And it turns out
that, that model also

00:43:01.770 --> 00:43:03.000
fits this data less well.

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:05.140
So here I'm just showing
two of those experiments.

00:43:05.140 --> 00:43:06.806
Some of them are well
fit by that model,

00:43:06.806 --> 00:43:09.182
but others are less well fit.

00:43:09.182 --> 00:43:10.890
Now, that's not to
say that they wouldn't

00:43:10.890 --> 00:43:11.710
be good for other things.

00:43:11.710 --> 00:43:12.930
So we also did some experiments.

00:43:12.930 --> 00:43:14.250
This was experiments
that we did.

00:43:14.250 --> 00:43:15.930
Oh, actually, I forgot to
say, really importantly,

00:43:15.930 --> 00:43:18.060
this was all worked done
by Charles Kemp, who's

00:43:18.060 --> 00:43:19.860
now a professor at CMU.

00:43:19.860 --> 00:43:24.870
And it was part of the stuff
that he did in his PhD thesis.

00:43:24.870 --> 00:43:28.430
So we were interested in this
as a way, not to study trees,

00:43:28.430 --> 00:43:30.680
but to study a range of
different kinds of structures.

00:43:30.680 --> 00:43:33.280
And it is true, going back,
I guess, to the question

00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:35.280
you asked, this is what
I was referring to about

00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:36.390
low-dimensional manifolds.

00:43:36.390 --> 00:43:38.520
There are some kinds of
knowledge representations

00:43:38.520 --> 00:43:40.830
we have which might have
a low-dimensional spatial

00:43:40.830 --> 00:43:44.340
structure, in particular,
like mental maps of the world.

00:43:44.340 --> 00:43:48.726
So our intuitive models of the
Earth's surface, and things

00:43:48.726 --> 00:43:50.850
which might be distributed
over the Earth's surface

00:43:50.850 --> 00:43:53.250
spatially, a two-dimensional
map is probably

00:43:53.250 --> 00:43:55.290
a good one for that.

00:43:55.290 --> 00:43:58.590
So here we considered a
similar kind of concept

00:43:58.590 --> 00:44:02.794
learning from a few examples
task, where we said--

00:44:02.794 --> 00:44:03.960
but now we put it like this.

00:44:03.960 --> 00:44:05.459
We said, suppose
that a certain kind

00:44:05.459 --> 00:44:07.170
of Native American
artifact has been

00:44:07.170 --> 00:44:09.240
found in sites near city x.

00:44:09.240 --> 00:44:12.480
How likely is it also to be
found in sites near city y?

00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:16.650
Or we could say sites near
city x and y, how about city z.

00:44:16.650 --> 00:44:21.390
And we told people that
different Native American

00:44:21.390 --> 00:44:25.200
tribes maybe had-- some lived
in a very small area, some

00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:26.487
lived in a very big area.

00:44:26.487 --> 00:44:28.320
Some lived in one place,
some another place.

00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:30.309
Some lived here, and
then moved there.

00:44:30.309 --> 00:44:32.850
We just told people very vague
things that taps into people's

00:44:32.850 --> 00:44:35.730
probably badly remembered,
and very distorted,

00:44:35.730 --> 00:44:39.930
versions of American history
that would basically suggests

00:44:39.930 --> 00:44:42.090
that there should be
some kind of similar kind

00:44:42.090 --> 00:44:44.010
of spatial diffusion
process, but now

00:44:44.010 --> 00:44:46.320
in your 2D mental map of cities.

00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:50.040
So again, there's no claim that
there's any reality to this,

00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:51.137
or fine-grained reality.

00:44:51.137 --> 00:44:53.220
But we thought it would
sort of roughly correspond

00:44:53.220 --> 00:44:55.410
to people's internal
causal generative

00:44:55.410 --> 00:44:58.800
models of archeology.

00:44:58.800 --> 00:45:00.900
Again, I think it says
something about the way

00:45:00.900 --> 00:45:02.566
human intelligence
works that none of us

00:45:02.566 --> 00:45:05.504
are archaeologists, probably,
but we still have these ideas.

00:45:05.504 --> 00:45:07.920
And it turned out that, here,
a spatially structured model

00:45:07.920 --> 00:45:08.940
actually works a lot better.

00:45:08.940 --> 00:45:10.356
Again, it shouldn't
be surprising.

00:45:10.356 --> 00:45:13.816
It's just showing that actually,
the way-- the judgments

00:45:13.816 --> 00:45:16.440
people make when they're making
inferences from a few examples,

00:45:16.440 --> 00:45:17.981
just like you saw
with the predicting

00:45:17.981 --> 00:45:20.070
the everyday events,
but now in the much more

00:45:20.070 --> 00:45:22.230
interestingly
structured domain, is

00:45:22.230 --> 00:45:25.200
sensitive to the different kinds
of environmental statistics.

00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:28.950
There it was different power
laws versus Gaussian's of cake

00:45:28.950 --> 00:45:34.080
bake-- or of movie grosses
versus lifetimes or something.

00:45:34.080 --> 00:45:35.580
Here it's other stuff.

00:45:35.580 --> 00:45:38.250
It's more interestingly
structured kinds of knowledge.

00:45:38.250 --> 00:45:40.050
But you see the same
kind of picture.

00:45:40.050 --> 00:45:41.760
And we thought that
was interesting,

00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:43.979
and again, suggests
some of the ways

00:45:43.979 --> 00:45:46.020
that we are starting to
put these tools together,

00:45:46.020 --> 00:45:48.019
putting together probabilistic
generative models

00:45:48.019 --> 00:45:50.340
with some kind of interestingly
structured knowledge.

00:45:50.340 --> 00:45:52.140
Now, again, as you
saw from Surya,

00:45:52.140 --> 00:45:54.740
and as Jay McClellan and
Tim Rogers worked on,

00:45:54.740 --> 00:45:56.490
you can try to capture
a lot of this stuff

00:45:56.490 --> 00:45:57.240
with neural networks.

00:45:57.240 --> 00:45:59.781
The neat thing about the neural
networks that these guys have

00:45:59.781 --> 00:46:03.090
worked on is that exactly
the same neural network can

00:46:03.090 --> 00:46:05.640
capture this kind
of thing, and it

00:46:05.640 --> 00:46:07.380
can capture this kind of thing.

00:46:07.380 --> 00:46:11.400
So you can train the very
same hidden multilayer neural

00:46:11.400 --> 00:46:16.260
network with one matrix
of object and features.

00:46:16.260 --> 00:46:17.790
And the very same
neural network can

00:46:17.790 --> 00:46:21.416
predict the tree-structured
patterns for animals

00:46:21.416 --> 00:46:23.790
and their properties, as well
as the spatially-structured

00:46:23.790 --> 00:46:27.090
patterns for Native American
artifacts and their cities.

00:46:27.090 --> 00:46:31.380
The catch is that it doesn't
do either of them that well.

00:46:31.380 --> 00:46:35.900
It doesn't do as well as the
tree-structured models do

00:46:35.900 --> 00:46:36.630
for peop--

00:46:36.630 --> 00:46:37.950
when I say either, it
doesn't do that well, I

00:46:37.950 --> 00:46:39.450
mean, in capturing
people's judgments.

00:46:39.450 --> 00:46:41.670
It doesn't do as well as the
best tree-structured models do

00:46:41.670 --> 00:46:43.919
for people's concepts of
animals and their properties.

00:46:43.919 --> 00:46:46.890
And it doesn't do as well as
the best spacial structures.

00:46:46.890 --> 00:46:50.130
But again, it's in the same
spirit as the DeepMind networks

00:46:50.130 --> 00:46:51.550
for playing lots of Atari games.

00:46:51.550 --> 00:46:53.550
The idea there is to have
the same network solve

00:46:53.550 --> 00:46:54.734
all these different tasks.

00:46:54.734 --> 00:46:56.650
And in some sense, I
think that's a good idea.

00:46:56.650 --> 00:46:58.709
I just think that the
architecture should

00:46:58.709 --> 00:47:00.000
have a more flexible structure.

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:02.100
So we would also
say, in some sense,

00:47:02.100 --> 00:47:04.560
the same architecture is solving
all these different tasks.

00:47:04.560 --> 00:47:07.200
It's just that this
is one setting of it.

00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:10.260
And this is another
setting of it.

00:47:10.260 --> 00:47:12.720
And where they differ is
in the kind of structure

00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:14.220
that-- well, they
differ in the fact

00:47:14.220 --> 00:47:16.502
that they explicitly represent
structure in the world.

00:47:16.502 --> 00:47:18.960
And they explicitly represent
different kinds of structure.

00:47:18.960 --> 00:47:21.043
And they explicitly represent
that different kinds

00:47:21.043 --> 00:47:23.895
of structure are appropriate
to different kinds of domains

00:47:23.895 --> 00:47:26.520
in the world and our intuitions
about the causal processes that

00:47:26.520 --> 00:47:28.470
are at work producing the data.

00:47:28.470 --> 00:47:29.970
And I think that,
again, that's sort

00:47:29.970 --> 00:47:32.136
of the difference between
the pattern classification

00:47:32.136 --> 00:47:33.840
and the understanding
or explaining

00:47:33.840 --> 00:47:37.680
view of intelligence.

00:47:37.680 --> 00:47:40.320
The explanations, of course,
go a lot beyond different ways

00:47:40.320 --> 00:47:42.120
that similarity
can be structured.

00:47:42.120 --> 00:47:44.220
So one of the kind
of nice things-- oh,

00:47:44.220 --> 00:47:46.380
and I guess another--

00:47:46.380 --> 00:47:48.360
two other points beyond that.

00:47:48.360 --> 00:47:50.070
One is that to get
the neural networks

00:47:50.070 --> 00:47:52.319
to do that, you have to train
them with a lot of data.

00:47:52.319 --> 00:47:55.380
Remember, Surya, as Tommy
pushed him on in that talk,

00:47:55.380 --> 00:47:57.570
Surya was very
concerned with modeling

00:47:57.570 --> 00:48:01.650
the dynamics of learning in the
sense of the optimization time

00:48:01.650 --> 00:48:04.410
course, how the weights
change over time.

00:48:04.410 --> 00:48:06.750
But he was usually
looking at infinite data.

00:48:06.750 --> 00:48:09.300
So he was assuming that
you had, effectively,

00:48:09.300 --> 00:48:11.940
an infinite number of columns
of any of these matrices.

00:48:11.940 --> 00:48:13.920
So you could perfectly
compute the statistics.

00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:15.920
And another important
thing about the difference

00:48:15.920 --> 00:48:18.503
being the neural network models
and the ones I was showing you

00:48:18.503 --> 00:48:21.030
is that, suppose you want
to train the model, not

00:48:21.030 --> 00:48:24.780
on an infinite matrix,
but on a small finite one,

00:48:24.780 --> 00:48:26.460
and maybe one with missing data.

00:48:26.460 --> 00:48:28.710
It's a lot harder to get
the-- the neural network will

00:48:28.710 --> 00:48:32.940
do a much poorer job capturing
the structure than these more

00:48:32.940 --> 00:48:33.760
structured models.

00:48:33.760 --> 00:48:35.750
And again, in a way
that's familiar with--

00:48:35.750 --> 00:48:38.820
have you guys talked about
bias-variance dilemma?

00:48:38.820 --> 00:48:42.249
So it's that same kind
of idea that you probably

00:48:42.249 --> 00:48:43.290
heard about from Lorenzo.

00:48:43.290 --> 00:48:45.520
Was it Lorenzo or one
of the machin learni--

00:48:45.520 --> 00:48:46.020
OK.

00:48:46.020 --> 00:48:48.019
So it's that same kind
of idea, but now applying

00:48:48.019 --> 00:48:50.370
in this interesting case
of structured estimation

00:48:50.370 --> 00:48:52.440
of generative models
for the world,

00:48:52.440 --> 00:48:56.340
that if you have relatively
little data, and sparse data,

00:48:56.340 --> 00:48:59.822
then having a more
structured inductive bi--

00:48:59.822 --> 00:49:02.280
having the inductive bias that
comes from a more structured

00:49:02.280 --> 00:49:06.030
representation is going to
be much more valuable when

00:49:06.030 --> 00:49:08.935
you have sparse and noisy data.

00:49:08.935 --> 00:49:11.310
The key-- and again, this is
something that Charles and I

00:49:11.310 --> 00:49:13.590
were really interested
in-- is we wanted to--

00:49:13.590 --> 00:49:16.080
like the DeepMind people,
like the connectionists,

00:49:16.080 --> 00:49:19.080
we wanted to build general
purpose semantic cognition,

00:49:19.080 --> 00:49:23.340
wanted to build general purpose
learning and reasoning systems.

00:49:23.340 --> 00:49:25.260
And we wanted to
somehow figure out

00:49:25.260 --> 00:49:27.843
how you could have the best of
both worlds, how you could have

00:49:27.843 --> 00:49:31.170
a system that relatively
quickly could come

00:49:31.170 --> 00:49:34.380
to get the right kind of strong
constraint-inductive bias

00:49:34.380 --> 00:49:37.110
in some domain, and a different
one for a different domain,

00:49:37.110 --> 00:49:38.700
yet could learn
in a flexible way

00:49:38.700 --> 00:49:41.580
to capture the different
structure in different domains.

00:49:41.580 --> 00:49:43.060
More on that in a little bit.

00:49:43.060 --> 00:49:45.150
But the other thing I
wanted to talk about here

00:49:45.150 --> 00:49:47.970
is just ways in which
our mental models,

00:49:47.970 --> 00:49:49.860
our causal and
compositional ones,

00:49:49.860 --> 00:49:51.991
go beyond just similarity.

00:49:51.991 --> 00:49:53.490
I guess, since time
is short-- well,

00:49:53.490 --> 00:49:55.698
I was planning to go through
this relatively quickly.

00:49:55.698 --> 00:49:57.902
But anyway, mostly I'll
just gesture towards this.

00:49:57.902 --> 00:49:59.360
And if you're
interested, you could

00:49:59.360 --> 00:50:02.200
read the papers that
Charles has, or his thesis.

00:50:02.200 --> 00:50:05.690
But here, there's a long
history of asking people

00:50:05.690 --> 00:50:07.460
to make these kind of
judgments, in which

00:50:07.460 --> 00:50:10.730
the basis for the judgment
isn't something like similarity,

00:50:10.730 --> 00:50:12.599
but some other kind
of causal reasoning.

00:50:12.599 --> 00:50:14.390
So for example, consider
these things here.

00:50:14.390 --> 00:50:17.234
Poodles can bite through wire,
therefore German shepherds

00:50:17.234 --> 00:50:18.150
can bite through wire.

00:50:18.150 --> 00:50:19.889
Is that a strong
argument or weak?

00:50:19.889 --> 00:50:22.430
Compare that with, dobermans
can bite through wire, therefore

00:50:22.430 --> 00:50:24.080
German shepherds can
bite through wire.

00:50:24.080 --> 00:50:26.600
So how many people think that
the top argument is a stronger

00:50:26.600 --> 00:50:27.890
one?

00:50:27.890 --> 00:50:30.320
How many people think the
bottom line is a stronger one?

00:50:30.320 --> 00:50:31.100
So that's typical.

00:50:31.100 --> 00:50:33.980
About twice as many
people prefer the top one.

00:50:33.980 --> 00:50:36.560
Because intuitively--
do I have a little thing

00:50:36.560 --> 00:50:37.370
that will appear?

00:50:37.370 --> 00:50:40.262
Intuitively, anyone want to
explain why you thought so?

00:50:44.198 --> 00:50:45.680
AUDIENCE: Poodles
are really small.

00:50:45.680 --> 00:50:47.330
JOSH TENENBAUM: Poodles
are small or weak.

00:50:47.330 --> 00:50:47.630
Yes.

00:50:47.630 --> 00:50:49.296
And German shepherds
are big and strong.

00:50:49.296 --> 00:50:50.817
And what about dobermans?

00:50:50.817 --> 00:50:52.900
AUDIENCE: They're just as
big as German shepherds.

00:50:52.900 --> 00:50:53.260
JOSH TENENBAUM: Yeah.

00:50:53.260 --> 00:50:53.860
That's right.

00:50:53.860 --> 00:50:56.291
So they're more similar
to German shepherds,

00:50:56.291 --> 00:50:57.790
because they're
both big and strong.

00:50:57.790 --> 00:51:01.327
But notice that something very
different is going on here.

00:51:01.327 --> 00:51:02.410
It's not about similarity.

00:51:02.410 --> 00:51:04.180
It's sort of anti-similarity.

00:51:04.180 --> 00:51:05.990
But it's not just
anti-similarity.

00:51:05.990 --> 00:51:09.160
Suppose I said, German
shepherds can bite through wire,

00:51:09.160 --> 00:51:11.320
therefore poodles can
bite through wire.

00:51:11.320 --> 00:51:12.489
Is that a good argument?

00:51:12.489 --> 00:51:13.030
AUDIENCE: No.

00:51:13.030 --> 00:51:13.630
It's an argument against.

00:51:13.630 --> 00:51:13.750
JOSH TENENBAUM: No.

00:51:13.750 --> 00:51:15.850
It's sort of a terrible
argument, right?

00:51:15.850 --> 00:51:18.970
So there's some kind of
asymmetric dimensional

00:51:18.970 --> 00:51:20.380
reasoning going on.

00:51:20.380 --> 00:51:23.470
Or similarly, if I said,
which of these seems better

00:51:23.470 --> 00:51:27.120
intuitively; Salmon
carry some bacteria,

00:51:27.120 --> 00:51:29.350
therefore grizzly bears
are likely to carry it,

00:51:29.350 --> 00:51:31.180
versus grizzly bears
carry this, therefore

00:51:31.180 --> 00:51:32.890
salmon are likely to carry it.

00:51:32.890 --> 00:51:36.280
How many people say salmon,
therefore grizzly bears?

00:51:36.280 --> 00:51:38.560
How many people say grizzly
bears, therefore salmon?

00:51:38.560 --> 00:51:39.870
How do you know?

00:51:39.870 --> 00:51:41.170
Those who-- yeah, you're right.

00:51:41.170 --> 00:51:43.128
I mean, you're right in
that's what people say.

00:51:43.128 --> 00:51:44.427
I don't know if it's right.

00:51:44.427 --> 00:51:45.260
Again, I made it up.

00:51:45.260 --> 00:51:47.170
But why did you say that,
those of you who said salmon?

00:51:47.170 --> 00:51:48.430
AUDIENCE: Bears eat salmon.

00:51:48.430 --> 00:51:49.180
JOSH TENENBAUM:
Bears eat salmon.

00:51:49.180 --> 00:51:49.680
Yeah.

00:51:49.680 --> 00:51:52.600
So assuming that's true,
so we're told or see on TV,

00:51:52.600 --> 00:51:53.140
then yeah.

00:51:53.140 --> 00:51:55.199
So anyway, these are
these different kinds

00:51:55.199 --> 00:51:56.365
of things that are going on.

00:51:56.365 --> 00:51:58.736
And to cut to the
chase, what we showed

00:51:58.736 --> 00:52:01.360
is that you could capture these
different patterns of reasoning

00:52:01.360 --> 00:52:04.190
with, again, the same kind
of thing, but different.

00:52:04.190 --> 00:52:08.230
It's also a hierarchical
generative model.

00:52:08.230 --> 00:52:10.480
It also has, the key
level of the hierarchy

00:52:10.480 --> 00:52:13.630
is some kind of directed
graphical structure

00:52:13.630 --> 00:52:16.012
that generates distribution
on observable properties.

00:52:16.012 --> 00:52:18.220
But it's a fundamentally
different kind of structure.

00:52:18.220 --> 00:52:20.680
It's not just a tree or a space.

00:52:20.680 --> 00:52:22.420
It might be a
different kind of graph

00:52:22.420 --> 00:52:23.890
and a different kind of process.

00:52:23.890 --> 00:52:26.740
So to be a little bit
more technical, the things

00:52:26.740 --> 00:52:29.400
I showed you with the tree
and the low-dimensional space,

00:52:29.400 --> 00:52:31.540
they had a different
geometry to the graph,

00:52:31.540 --> 00:52:34.090
but the same stochastic
process operating over it.

00:52:34.090 --> 00:52:36.730
It was, in both cases,
basically a diffusion process.

00:52:36.730 --> 00:52:39.292
Whereas to get the kinds of
reasoning that you saw here,

00:52:39.292 --> 00:52:40.750
you need a different
kind of graph.

00:52:40.750 --> 00:52:44.020
In one case it's like a chain to
capture a dimension of strength

00:52:44.020 --> 00:52:45.230
or size, say.

00:52:45.230 --> 00:52:47.494
In the other case, it's
some kind of food web thing.

00:52:47.494 --> 00:52:48.160
It's not a tree.

00:52:48.160 --> 00:52:50.860
It's that kind of
directed network.

00:52:50.860 --> 00:52:52.750
But you also need a
different process.

00:52:52.750 --> 00:52:54.580
So the ways-- the kind
of probability model

00:52:54.580 --> 00:52:55.840
to find that out is different.

00:52:55.840 --> 00:52:57.460
And it's easy to see on the--

00:52:57.460 --> 00:53:00.970
for example-- on the reasoning
with these threshold things,

00:53:00.970 --> 00:53:02.710
like the strength
properties, if you

00:53:02.710 --> 00:53:07.870
compare a 1D chain with
just symmetric diffusion,

00:53:07.870 --> 00:53:09.280
you get a much
worse fit people's

00:53:09.280 --> 00:53:11.410
judgments than if you'd used
what we called this drift

00:53:11.410 --> 00:53:13.576
threshold thing, which is
basically a way of saying,

00:53:13.576 --> 00:53:14.890
OK, I don't know.

00:53:14.890 --> 00:53:17.407
There's some mapping
from strength to being

00:53:17.407 --> 00:53:18.490
able to bite through wire.

00:53:18.490 --> 00:53:19.820
I don't know exactly what it is.

00:53:19.820 --> 00:53:21.340
But the higher up
you go on one, it's

00:53:21.340 --> 00:53:23.006
probably more likely
that you can bite--

00:53:23.006 --> 00:53:24.497
that you can do the other.

00:53:24.497 --> 00:53:26.830
So that provides a wonderful
model of people's judgments

00:53:26.830 --> 00:53:28.660
on these kind of tasks.

00:53:28.660 --> 00:53:30.700
But that sort of
diffusion process,

00:53:30.700 --> 00:53:34.510
like if it was like mutation
in biology, then that

00:53:34.510 --> 00:53:35.980
would provide a very bad model.

00:53:35.980 --> 00:53:38.320
That's the second row here.

00:53:38.320 --> 00:53:41.830
Similarly, this sort of directed
kind of noisy transmission

00:53:41.830 --> 00:53:46.890
process on a food web does a
great way of modeling people's

00:53:46.890 --> 00:53:48.730
judgments about
diseases, but not

00:53:48.730 --> 00:53:51.520
a very good way of
modeling people's judgments

00:53:51.520 --> 00:53:53.230
about these
biological properties.

00:53:53.230 --> 00:53:55.300
But the tree models
you saw before that

00:53:55.300 --> 00:53:56.770
do a great job of
modeling people's

00:53:56.770 --> 00:53:58.520
judgments about the
properties of animals,

00:53:58.520 --> 00:54:01.420
they do a lousy job of modeling
these disease judgments.

00:54:01.420 --> 00:54:04.060
So we have this picture
emerging that, at the time,

00:54:04.060 --> 00:54:05.950
was very satisfying to us.

00:54:05.950 --> 00:54:08.380
That, hey, we can take
this domain of, say,

00:54:08.380 --> 00:54:10.870
animals and their properties,
or the various things we

00:54:10.870 --> 00:54:14.110
can reason about, and there's
a lot of different ways

00:54:14.110 --> 00:54:15.940
we can reason about
just this one domain.

00:54:15.940 --> 00:54:18.942
And by building these
structured probabilistic models

00:54:18.942 --> 00:54:20.650
with different kinds
of graphs structures

00:54:20.650 --> 00:54:22.990
that capture different
kinds of causal processes,

00:54:22.990 --> 00:54:25.690
we could really describe
a lot of different kinds

00:54:25.690 --> 00:54:27.640
of reasoning.

00:54:27.640 --> 00:54:29.249
And we saw this
as part of a theme

00:54:29.249 --> 00:54:31.040
that a lot of other
people were working on.

00:54:31.040 --> 00:54:32.590
So this is-- I
mentioned this before,

00:54:32.590 --> 00:54:35.440
but now I'm just sort of
throwing it all out there.

00:54:35.440 --> 00:54:36.970
A lot of people at
the time-- again,

00:54:36.970 --> 00:54:40.690
this is maybe somewhere
between 5 to 10 years ago--

00:54:40.690 --> 00:54:43.930
more like six or
seven years ago--

00:54:43.930 --> 00:54:46.930
we're extremely interested
in this general view

00:54:46.930 --> 00:54:49.540
of common sense reasoning
and semantic cognition

00:54:49.540 --> 00:54:51.599
by basically taking big
matrices and boiling them

00:54:51.599 --> 00:54:53.140
down to some kind
of graph structure.

00:54:53.140 --> 00:54:55.699
In some form, that's what
Tom Mitchell was doing,

00:54:55.699 --> 00:54:57.490
not just in the talk
you saw, but remember,

00:54:57.490 --> 00:54:59.380
he said there's this
other stuff he does--

00:54:59.380 --> 00:55:01.960
this thing called NELL, the
Never Ending Language Learner.

00:55:01.960 --> 00:55:03.460
I'm showing a little
glimpse of that

00:55:03.460 --> 00:55:06.730
up there from a New York Times
piece on it in the upper right.

00:55:06.730 --> 00:55:09.220
In some ways, in a sort of
at least more implicit way,

00:55:09.220 --> 00:55:11.560
it's what the neural networks
that Jay McClelland, Tim

00:55:11.560 --> 00:55:14.156
Rogers, Surya were
talking about do.

00:55:14.156 --> 00:55:16.030
And we thought-- you
know, we had good reason

00:55:16.030 --> 00:55:17.830
to think that our
approach was more

00:55:17.830 --> 00:55:20.630
like what people were doing
than some of these others.

00:55:20.630 --> 00:55:23.380
But I then came to see-- and
this was around the time when

00:55:23.380 --> 00:55:25.367
CBMM was actually
getting started--

00:55:25.367 --> 00:55:26.950
that none of these
were going to work.

00:55:26.950 --> 00:55:29.680
Like the whole thing was
just not going to work.

00:55:29.680 --> 00:55:32.370
Liz was one of the main people
who convinced me of this.

00:55:32.370 --> 00:55:34.120
But you could just
read the New York Times

00:55:34.120 --> 00:55:37.210
article on Tom Mitchell's piece,
and you can see what's missing.

00:55:37.210 --> 00:55:40.750
So there's Tom, remember.

00:55:40.750 --> 00:55:43.510
This was an article from 2010.

00:55:43.510 --> 00:55:46.070
Just to set the chronology
right, that was right around--

00:55:46.070 --> 00:55:48.490
a little bit after Charles had
finished all that nice work

00:55:48.490 --> 00:55:51.440
I showed you, which again,
I still think is valuable.

00:55:51.440 --> 00:55:53.260
I think it is
capturing something

00:55:53.260 --> 00:55:55.390
about what's going on.

00:55:55.390 --> 00:55:57.520
It was very appealing to
people, like at Google,

00:55:57.520 --> 00:56:00.490
because these knowledge graphs
are very much like the way,

00:56:00.490 --> 00:56:02.380
around the same time,
Google was starting

00:56:02.380 --> 00:56:04.690
to try to put more
semantics into web search--

00:56:04.690 --> 00:56:07.330
again, connected to the
work that Tom was doing.

00:56:07.330 --> 00:56:09.820
And there was this nice
article in the New York

00:56:09.820 --> 00:56:12.850
Times talking about how they
built their system by reading

00:56:12.850 --> 00:56:13.780
the web.

00:56:13.780 --> 00:56:15.387
But the best part
of it was describing

00:56:15.387 --> 00:56:16.970
one of the mistakes
their system made.

00:56:16.970 --> 00:56:18.949
So let me just show this to you.

00:56:18.949 --> 00:56:20.740
About knowledge that's
obvious to a person,

00:56:20.740 --> 00:56:22.540
but not to a
computer-- again, it's

00:56:22.540 --> 00:56:25.566
Tom Mitchell himself
describing this.

00:56:25.566 --> 00:56:27.940
And the challenge of, that's
where NELL has to be headed,

00:56:27.940 --> 00:56:30.610
is how to make the things
that are obvious to people

00:56:30.610 --> 00:56:33.160
obvious to computers.

00:56:33.160 --> 00:56:35.590
He gives this
example of a bug that

00:56:35.590 --> 00:56:38.560
happened in NELL's early life.

00:56:38.560 --> 00:56:40.980
The research team noticed that--

00:56:40.980 --> 00:56:42.990
oh, let's skip down there.

00:56:42.990 --> 00:56:44.330
So, a particular example--

00:56:44.330 --> 00:56:47.920
when Dr. Mitchell scanned the
baked goods category recently,

00:56:47.920 --> 00:56:50.050
he noticed a clear pattern.

00:56:50.050 --> 00:56:51.760
NELL was at first
quite accurate, easily

00:56:51.760 --> 00:56:54.420
identifying all kinds of pies,
breads, cakes, and cookies

00:56:54.420 --> 00:56:55.570
as baked goods.

00:56:55.570 --> 00:56:58.620
But things went awry after
NELL's noun phrase classifier

00:56:58.620 --> 00:57:00.370
decided internet cookies
was a baked good.

00:57:03.100 --> 00:57:06.100
NELL had read the sentence "I
deleted my internet cookies."

00:57:06.100 --> 00:57:07.960
And again, think of
that as, it's kind

00:57:07.960 --> 00:57:09.340
of like a simple proposition.

00:57:09.340 --> 00:57:10.180
It's like, OK.

00:57:10.180 --> 00:57:12.184
But the way it parses
that is cookies

00:57:12.184 --> 00:57:14.350
are things that can be
deleted, the same way you can

00:57:14.350 --> 00:57:16.040
say horses have T9 hormones.

00:57:16.040 --> 00:57:17.500
It's basically just a matrix.

00:57:17.500 --> 00:57:21.220
And the concept is
internet cookies.

00:57:21.220 --> 00:57:23.620
And then there's the
property of can be deleted,

00:57:23.620 --> 00:57:25.545
or something like that.

00:57:25.545 --> 00:57:27.920
And it knows something about
natural language processing.

00:57:27.920 --> 00:57:28.644
So it can see--

00:57:28.644 --> 00:57:30.060
and it's trying
to be intelligent.

00:57:30.060 --> 00:57:30.980
Oh, internet cookies.

00:57:30.980 --> 00:57:33.160
Well, maybe like chocolate
chip cookies and oatmeal raisin

00:57:33.160 --> 00:57:34.743
cookies, those were
a kind of cookies.

00:57:34.743 --> 00:57:36.170
Basically, that's what it did.

00:57:36.170 --> 00:57:37.670
Or no, actually
did the opposite.

00:57:37.670 --> 00:57:39.340
[LAUGHS]

00:57:39.340 --> 00:57:42.740
It said-- when it read
"I deleted my files,"

00:57:42.740 --> 00:57:44.740
it decided files was
probably a baked good, too.

00:57:44.740 --> 00:57:46.990
Well, first it decided internet
cookies was a baked good,

00:57:46.990 --> 00:57:47.710
like those other cookies.

00:57:47.710 --> 00:57:49.450
And then it decided that
files were a baked goods.

00:57:49.450 --> 00:57:51.450
And it started this whole
avalanche of mistakes,

00:57:51.450 --> 00:57:52.776
Dr. Mitchell said.

00:57:52.776 --> 00:57:54.400
He corrected the
internet cookies error

00:57:54.400 --> 00:57:56.827
and restarted NELL's
bakery education.

00:57:56.827 --> 00:57:57.910
[LAUGHS] I mean, like, OK.

00:57:57.910 --> 00:58:02.080
Now rerun without that problem.

00:58:02.080 --> 00:58:04.365
So the point, the lesson
Tom draws from this,

00:58:04.365 --> 00:58:05.740
and that the
article talks about,

00:58:05.740 --> 00:58:07.630
is, oh, well, we still
need some assistance.

00:58:07.630 --> 00:58:10.010
We have to go back and,
by hand, set these things.

00:58:10.010 --> 00:58:11.902
But the key thing
is that, really--

00:58:11.902 --> 00:58:13.360
I think the message
this is telling

00:58:13.360 --> 00:58:16.360
us is no human child would
ever make this mistake.

00:58:16.360 --> 00:58:17.735
Human children
learn in this way.

00:58:17.735 --> 00:58:19.401
They don't need this
kind of assistance.

00:58:19.401 --> 00:58:21.310
It's true that, as Tom
says, you and I don't

00:58:21.310 --> 00:58:22.730
learn in isolation either.

00:58:22.730 --> 00:58:24.688
So, all of the things
we've been talking about,

00:58:24.688 --> 00:58:27.280
about learning from prior
knowledge and so on, are true.

00:58:27.280 --> 00:58:30.010
But there's a basic kind
of common sense thing

00:58:30.010 --> 00:58:32.710
that this is missing,
which is that at the time

00:58:32.710 --> 00:58:34.300
a child is learning
anything about--

00:58:34.300 --> 00:58:37.600
by the time a child is learning
anything about computers,

00:58:37.600 --> 00:58:40.300
and files, and so on, they
understand well before that,

00:58:40.300 --> 00:58:43.030
like back in early infancy, from
say, work that Liz has done,

00:58:43.030 --> 00:58:47.020
and many others, that cookies,
in the sense of baked goods,

00:58:47.020 --> 00:58:49.960
are a physical object, a kind
of food, a thing you eat.

00:58:49.960 --> 00:58:52.441
Files, email-- not
a physical object.

00:58:52.441 --> 00:58:54.190
And there's all sorts
of interesting stuff

00:58:54.190 --> 00:58:57.640
to understand about how kids
learn that a book can be both

00:58:57.640 --> 00:59:00.100
a no-- a novel is both
a story and it's also

00:59:00.100 --> 00:59:02.560
a physical object, and
so a lot of that stuff.

00:59:02.560 --> 00:59:05.380
But there's a basic
common sense understanding

00:59:05.380 --> 00:59:08.170
of the world as consisting
of physical objects,

00:59:08.170 --> 00:59:09.921
and for example,
agents and their goals.

00:59:09.921 --> 00:59:11.670
You heard a little bit
about this from us,

00:59:11.670 --> 00:59:13.270
from me and Tomer,
on the first day.

00:59:13.270 --> 00:59:15.060
And that's where I
want to turn to next.

00:59:15.060 --> 00:59:17.810
And this is just one of many
examples that we realized,

00:59:17.810 --> 00:59:21.610
as cool as this system is, as
great as all this stuff is,

00:59:21.610 --> 00:59:24.670
just trying to approach semantic
knowledge and common sense

00:59:24.670 --> 00:59:27.460
reasoning as some kind
of big matrix completion

00:59:27.460 --> 00:59:30.580
without a much more fundamental
grasp of the ways in which

00:59:30.580 --> 00:59:32.824
the world is real
to a human mind,

00:59:32.824 --> 00:59:34.990
well before they're learning
anything about language

00:59:34.990 --> 00:59:36.930
or any of this
higher level stuff,

00:59:36.930 --> 00:59:39.850
it was just not going
to work, in the same way

00:59:39.850 --> 00:59:42.100
that I think if you want to
build a system that learns

00:59:42.100 --> 00:59:44.100
to play a video game,
even remotely like the way

00:59:44.100 --> 00:59:44.830
a human does,

00:59:44.830 --> 00:59:47.165
there's a lot of more basic
stuff you have to build on.

00:59:47.165 --> 00:59:49.040
And it's the same basic
stuff, I would argue.

00:59:49.040 --> 00:59:50.920
A cool thing about
Atari video games

00:59:50.920 --> 00:59:54.310
is that, even though they
were very low resolution,

00:59:54.310 --> 00:59:59.140
very low-bit color displays,
with very big pixels, what

00:59:59.140 --> 01:00:01.750
makes your ability to
learn that game work is

01:00:01.750 --> 01:00:04.840
the same kind of thing that
makes the ability, even as

01:00:04.840 --> 01:00:07.030
a young child, to not
make this mistake.

01:00:07.030 --> 01:00:09.370
And it's the kind of
thing that Liz and people

01:00:09.370 --> 01:00:11.530
in her field of
developmental psychology--

01:00:11.530 --> 01:00:14.710
in particular, infant research--
have been studying really

01:00:14.710 --> 01:00:16.960
excitingly for a
couple of decades.

01:00:16.960 --> 01:00:20.144
That, I think, is as
transformative for the topic

01:00:20.144 --> 01:00:22.060
of intelligence in brains,
minds, and machines

01:00:22.060 --> 01:00:23.090
as anything.

01:00:23.090 --> 01:00:24.880
So that's what
motivated the work we've

01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:27.213
been doing in the last few
years and the main work we're

01:00:27.213 --> 01:00:28.480
trying to do in the center.

01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:31.830
And it also goes hand-in-hand
with the ways in which

01:00:31.830 --> 01:00:34.810
we've realized that we have
to take what we've learned how

01:00:34.810 --> 01:00:37.570
to do with building problematic
models over interesting

01:00:37.570 --> 01:00:39.200
symbolically-structured
representations

01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:42.550
and so on, but move way
beyond what you could call--

01:00:42.550 --> 01:00:45.379
I mean, we need better,
even more interesting,

01:00:45.379 --> 01:00:46.420
symbolic representations.

01:00:46.420 --> 01:00:48.760
In particular, we need
to move beyond graphs

01:00:48.760 --> 01:00:52.441
and stochastic processes
defined over graphs to programs.

01:00:52.441 --> 01:00:54.190
So that's where the
probabilistic programs

01:00:54.190 --> 01:00:55.790
come back into the mix.

01:00:55.790 --> 01:00:57.100
So again, you already saw this.

01:00:57.100 --> 01:00:58.641
And I'm trying to
close the loop back

01:00:58.641 --> 01:00:59.860
to what we're doing in CBMM.

01:00:59.860 --> 01:01:01.960
I've given you
about 10 to 15 years

01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:04.669
of background in our field
of how we got to this, why

01:01:04.669 --> 01:01:06.460
we think this is
interesting and important,

01:01:06.460 --> 01:01:08.350
and why we think we need to--

01:01:08.350 --> 01:01:11.170
why we've developed a
certain toolkit of ideas,

01:01:11.170 --> 01:01:15.100
and why we think we needed
to keep extending it.

01:01:15.100 --> 01:01:17.830
And I think, as you saw
before, and as you'll see,

01:01:17.830 --> 01:01:19.512
this also, in some ways--

01:01:19.512 --> 01:01:21.970
I think we're getting more and
more to the interesting part

01:01:21.970 --> 01:01:22.871
of common sense.

01:01:22.871 --> 01:01:25.120
But in another way, we're
getting back to the problems

01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:26.500
I started off with
and what a lot

01:01:26.500 --> 01:01:27.880
of other people at
this summer school

01:01:27.880 --> 01:01:29.380
have an interest
in, which is things

01:01:29.380 --> 01:01:31.810
like much more basic aspects
of visual perception.

01:01:31.810 --> 01:01:35.020
I think the heart of real
intelligence and common sense

01:01:35.020 --> 01:01:37.050
reasoning that
we're talking about

01:01:37.050 --> 01:01:40.180
is directly connected to vision
and other sense modalities,

01:01:40.180 --> 01:01:42.580
and how we get around in the
world and plan our actions,

01:01:42.580 --> 01:01:45.157
and the very basic
kinds of goal social

01:01:45.157 --> 01:01:47.240
understandings that you
saw in those little videos

01:01:47.240 --> 01:01:49.027
of the red and blue
ball, or that you

01:01:49.027 --> 01:01:51.360
see if you're trying to do
action recognition and action

01:01:51.360 --> 01:01:52.450
understanding.

01:01:52.450 --> 01:01:55.080
So in some sense, it's
gotten more cognitive.

01:01:55.080 --> 01:01:58.080
But it's also, by getting to
the root of our common sense

01:01:58.080 --> 01:02:01.350
knowledge, it makes better
contact with vision,

01:02:01.350 --> 01:02:02.980
with neuroscience research.

01:02:02.980 --> 01:02:05.429
And so I think it's a
super exciting development

01:02:05.429 --> 01:02:07.470
in what we're doing for
the larger Brains, Minds,

01:02:07.470 --> 01:02:09.150
and Machines agenda.

01:02:09.150 --> 01:02:10.770
So again, now we're
saying, OK, let's

01:02:10.770 --> 01:02:13.920
try to understand
the way in which--

01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:16.530
even these kids
playing with blocks,

01:02:16.530 --> 01:02:19.290
the world is real to them.

01:02:19.290 --> 01:02:21.209
It's not just a
big matrix of data.

01:02:21.209 --> 01:02:22.500
That is a thing in their hands.

01:02:22.500 --> 01:02:24.083
And they have an
understanding of what

01:02:24.083 --> 01:02:27.540
a thing is before they start
compiling lists of properties.

01:02:27.540 --> 01:02:29.430
And they're playing
with somebody else.

01:02:29.430 --> 01:02:31.890
That hand is attached to
a person, who has goals.

01:02:31.890 --> 01:02:35.410
It's not just a big matrix
of rows and columns.

01:02:35.410 --> 01:02:38.430
It's an agent with
goals, and even a mind.

01:02:38.430 --> 01:02:41.610
And they understand
those things before they

01:02:41.610 --> 01:02:44.605
start to learn a lot of other
things, like words for objects,

01:02:44.605 --> 01:02:49.000
and advanced game-playing
behavior, and so on.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:50.820
And when we want to
talk about learning,

01:02:50.820 --> 01:02:52.695
we still are interested
in one-shot learning,

01:02:52.695 --> 01:02:55.440
or very rapid learning
from a few examples.

01:02:55.440 --> 01:02:58.950
And we're still interested
in how prior knowledge guides

01:02:58.950 --> 01:03:01.390
that, and how that
knowledge can be built.

01:03:01.390 --> 01:03:03.080
But we want to do
it in this context.

01:03:03.080 --> 01:03:04.410
We want to study in
the context of, say,

01:03:04.410 --> 01:03:06.210
how you learn how magnets
work, or how you learn

01:03:06.210 --> 01:03:08.760
how a touchscreen device
works-- really interesting kinds

01:03:08.760 --> 01:03:12.900
of grounded physical causes.

01:03:12.900 --> 01:03:15.990
So this is what we
have, or what I've come

01:03:15.990 --> 01:03:18.889
to call the common sense core.

01:03:18.889 --> 01:03:21.180
Liz, are you going to talk
about core knowledge at all?

01:03:21.180 --> 01:03:22.596
so there's a phrase
that Liz likes

01:03:22.596 --> 01:03:23.820
to use called core knowledge.

01:03:23.820 --> 01:03:25.620
And this is definitely
meant to evoke that.

01:03:25.620 --> 01:03:27.780
And it's inspired by it.

01:03:27.780 --> 01:03:29.269
I guess I changed
it a little bit,

01:03:29.269 --> 01:03:30.810
because I wanted it
to mean something

01:03:30.810 --> 01:03:32.080
a little bit different.

01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:34.410
And I think, again, to
anticipate a little bit,

01:03:34.410 --> 01:03:35.789
the main difference is--

01:03:35.789 --> 01:03:36.330
I don't know.

01:03:36.330 --> 01:03:38.667
What's the main difference?

01:03:38.667 --> 01:03:40.500
The main difference is
that, in the same way

01:03:40.500 --> 01:03:42.090
that lots of people look
at me and say, oh, he's

01:03:42.090 --> 01:03:44.190
the Bayesian guy, lots
of people look at Liz

01:03:44.190 --> 01:03:47.340
and say, oh, she's the
nativist gal or something.

01:03:47.340 --> 01:03:49.590
And it's true that, compared
to a lot of other people,

01:03:49.590 --> 01:03:51.330
I tend to be more
interested, and have

01:03:51.330 --> 01:03:53.070
done more work
prominently associated

01:03:53.070 --> 01:03:54.507
with Bayesian inference.

01:03:54.507 --> 01:03:56.590
But by no means do I think
that's the whole story.

01:03:56.590 --> 01:03:58.860
And part of what I tried to show
you, and will keep showing you,

01:03:58.860 --> 01:03:59.880
is ways in which
that's only really

01:03:59.880 --> 01:04:01.005
the beginning of the story.

01:04:01.005 --> 01:04:02.670
And Liz is prominently
associated,

01:04:02.670 --> 01:04:05.850
and you'll see some of this,
with really fascinating

01:04:05.850 --> 01:04:10.290
discoveries that key high
level concepts, key kinds

01:04:10.290 --> 01:04:13.230
of real knowledge, are
present, in some sense,

01:04:13.230 --> 01:04:16.890
as early as you can look,
and in some form, I think,

01:04:16.890 --> 01:04:20.490
very plausibly, have to be
due to some kind of innately

01:04:20.490 --> 01:04:23.070
unfolding genetic program that
builds a mind the same way it

01:04:23.070 --> 01:04:23.820
builds a brain.

01:04:23.820 --> 01:04:25.140
But just as we'll
hear from her, that's,

01:04:25.140 --> 01:04:27.223
in some ways, only the
beginning, or only one part

01:04:27.223 --> 01:04:29.130
of a much richer,
more interesting story

01:04:29.130 --> 01:04:31.450
that she's been developing.

01:04:31.450 --> 01:04:33.274
But for that, among
other reasons,

01:04:33.274 --> 01:04:34.690
I'm calling it a
little different.

01:04:34.690 --> 01:04:36.990
And I'm trying to emphasize the
connection to what people in AI

01:04:36.990 --> 01:04:38.156
call common sense reasoning.

01:04:38.156 --> 01:04:41.050
Because I really do think this
is the heart of common sense.

01:04:41.050 --> 01:04:43.380
It's this intuitive physics
and intuitive psychology.

01:04:43.380 --> 01:04:47.610
So again, you saw us already
give an intro to this.

01:04:47.610 --> 01:04:49.950
Maybe what I'll just do is
show you a little bit more

01:04:49.950 --> 01:04:53.692
of the-- well, are you going
to talk about the stuff at all?

01:04:53.692 --> 01:04:54.525
LIZ SPELKE: I guess.

01:04:54.525 --> 01:04:55.020
Yeah.

01:04:55.020 --> 01:04:56.061
JOSH TENENBAUM: Well, OK.

01:04:56.061 --> 01:04:58.599
So this is work-- some of
this is based on Liz's work.

01:04:58.599 --> 01:05:00.390
Some of this is based
on Renée Baillargeon,

01:05:00.390 --> 01:05:02.950
a close colleague of hers, and
many other people out there.

01:05:02.950 --> 01:05:04.800
And I wasn't really going
to go into the details.

01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:07.230
And maybe, Liz, we can decide
whether you want to do this

01:05:07.230 --> 01:05:07.740
or not.

01:05:07.740 --> 01:05:10.920
But what they've shown
is that, even prior

01:05:10.920 --> 01:05:14.280
to the time when kids are
learning words for objects,

01:05:14.280 --> 01:05:17.400
all of this stuff with infants,
two months, four months, eight

01:05:17.400 --> 01:05:18.840
months--

01:05:18.840 --> 01:05:23.520
at this age, kids have, at
best, some vague statistical

01:05:23.520 --> 01:05:26.460
associations of words
to kinds of objects.

01:05:26.460 --> 01:05:28.860
But they already
have a great deal

01:05:28.860 --> 01:05:30.630
of much more abstract
understanding

01:05:30.630 --> 01:05:33.120
of physical objects.

01:05:33.120 --> 01:05:36.732
So I won't-- maybe I should
not go into the details of it.

01:05:36.732 --> 01:05:38.940
But you saw it in that nice
video of the baby playing

01:05:38.940 --> 01:05:39.523
with the cups.

01:05:42.015 --> 01:05:44.364
And there's really
interesting, sort

01:05:44.364 --> 01:05:45.780
of rough, developmental
timelines.

01:05:45.780 --> 01:05:47.946
One of the things we're
trying to figure out in CBMM

01:05:47.946 --> 01:05:51.120
is to actually get much,
much clearer picture on this.

01:05:51.120 --> 01:05:54.120
But at least if you look across
a bunch of different studies,

01:05:54.120 --> 01:05:57.090
sometimes by one lab,
sometimes up by multiple labs,

01:05:57.090 --> 01:06:00.360
you see ways in which, say,
going from two months to five

01:06:00.360 --> 01:06:01.979
months, or five
months to 12 months,

01:06:01.979 --> 01:06:04.020
kids seem to-- their
intuitive physics of objects

01:06:04.020 --> 01:06:06.210
is getting a little
bit more sophisticated.

01:06:06.210 --> 01:06:12.180
So for example, they
tend to understand--

01:06:12.180 --> 01:06:14.880
in some form, they understand
a little bit of how collisions

01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:19.830
conserve momentum, a little bit,
by five months or six months--

01:06:19.830 --> 01:06:22.410
according to one of
Baillargeon's studies--

01:06:22.410 --> 01:06:25.230
in the sense that if they
see a ball roll down a ramp

01:06:25.230 --> 01:06:28.830
and hit another one,
and the second one goes

01:06:28.830 --> 01:06:31.395
a certain distance, if
a bigger object comes,

01:06:31.395 --> 01:06:33.520
they're not too surprised
if this one goes farther.

01:06:33.520 --> 01:06:35.800
But if a little object hits
it, then they are surprised.

01:06:35.800 --> 01:06:37.966
So they expect a bigger
object to be able to move it

01:06:37.966 --> 01:06:39.270
more than a little object.

01:06:39.270 --> 01:06:41.340
But a two-month-old
doesn't understand that.

01:06:41.340 --> 01:06:43.890
Although a two-month-old does
understand-- this is, again,

01:06:43.890 --> 01:06:45.000
from Liz's work--

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.970
that if an object is
colluded by a screen,

01:06:47.970 --> 01:06:50.010
it hasn't disappeared,
and that if an object

01:06:50.010 --> 01:06:52.980
is rolling towards a wall,
and that wall looks solid,

01:06:52.980 --> 01:06:56.174
that the object can't go through
it, and that if it somehow--

01:06:56.174 --> 01:06:58.590
when the screen is removed,
as you see on the upper left--

01:06:58.590 --> 01:07:00.840
appears on the other side
of the screen, that's

01:07:00.840 --> 01:07:01.954
very surprising to them.

01:07:01.954 --> 01:07:04.620
I think-- I'm sure what Liz will
talk about, among other things,

01:07:04.620 --> 01:07:07.710
are the methods they use, the
looking time methods to reveal

01:07:07.710 --> 01:07:09.795
this.

01:07:09.795 --> 01:07:11.490
And I think there's really--

01:07:11.490 --> 01:07:14.200
this is one of the two
main insights that I,

01:07:14.200 --> 01:07:15.630
and I think our
whole field, needs

01:07:15.630 --> 01:07:17.850
to learn from
developmental psychology,

01:07:17.850 --> 01:07:20.730
is how much of a basic
understanding of physics

01:07:20.730 --> 01:07:23.390
like this is present very early.

01:07:23.390 --> 01:07:25.710
And it doesn't
matter whether it's--

01:07:25.710 --> 01:07:28.140
in some sense, it doesn't
matter for the points

01:07:28.140 --> 01:07:31.440
I want to make here, how much
or in what way this is innate,

01:07:31.440 --> 01:07:34.719
or how the genetics and
the experience interact.

01:07:34.719 --> 01:07:35.760
I mean, that does matter.

01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:37.801
And that, that's something
we want to understand,

01:07:37.801 --> 01:07:39.450
and we are hoping
to try to understand

01:07:39.450 --> 01:07:41.830
in the hopefully
not-too-distant future.

01:07:41.830 --> 01:07:43.404
But for the purpose
of understanding

01:07:43.404 --> 01:07:44.820
what is the heart
of common sense,

01:07:44.820 --> 01:07:47.070
how are we going to build
these causal, compositional,

01:07:47.070 --> 01:07:49.149
generative models to
really get at intelligence,

01:07:49.149 --> 01:07:51.690
the main thing is that it should
be about this kind of stuff.

01:07:51.690 --> 01:07:52.800
That's the main focus.

01:07:52.800 --> 01:07:56.340
And then the other big insight
from developmental psychology,

01:07:56.340 --> 01:07:58.260
which has to do with
how we build this stuff,

01:07:58.260 --> 01:08:02.130
is this idea sometimes called
the child as scientist.

01:08:02.130 --> 01:08:04.950
The basic idea is that, just
as this early commonsense

01:08:04.950 --> 01:08:07.227
knowledge is something
like a scientific theory,

01:08:07.227 --> 01:08:09.810
something like a good scientific
theory, the way Newton's laws

01:08:09.810 --> 01:08:12.330
are a better scientific
theory than Kepler's laws

01:08:12.330 --> 01:08:14.910
because of how they capture the
causal structure of the world

01:08:14.910 --> 01:08:15.965
in a compositional way.

01:08:15.965 --> 01:08:17.340
That's another
way to sum up what

01:08:17.340 --> 01:08:20.850
I'm trying to say about
children's early knowledge.

01:08:20.850 --> 01:08:23.520
But also, the way children build
their knowledge is something

01:08:23.520 --> 01:08:25.710
like the way scientists
build their knowledge, which

01:08:25.710 --> 01:08:30.700
is, well, they do
experiments, of course.

01:08:30.700 --> 01:08:32.649
We normally call that play.

01:08:32.649 --> 01:08:34.474
That's one of Laura's
Schulz's big ideas.

01:08:34.474 --> 01:08:36.140
But it's not just
about the experiments.

01:08:36.140 --> 01:08:38.410
I mean, Newton didn't
really do any experiments.

01:08:38.410 --> 01:08:39.077
He just thought.

01:08:39.077 --> 01:08:41.451
And that's another thing you'll
hear from Laura, and also

01:08:41.451 --> 01:08:43.870
from Tomer, is that a lot
of children's learning

01:08:43.870 --> 01:08:46.810
looks less like, say, stochastic
gradient descent, and more

01:08:46.810 --> 01:08:49.479
like scratching your head
and trying to make sense of,

01:08:49.479 --> 01:08:51.337
well, that's really funny.

01:08:51.337 --> 01:08:52.420
Why does this happen here?

01:08:52.420 --> 01:08:53.890
Why does that happen over there?

01:08:53.890 --> 01:08:57.250
Or how can I explain
what seemed to be

01:08:57.250 --> 01:09:00.790
diverse patterns of phenomena
with some common underlying

01:09:00.790 --> 01:09:02.859
principles, and making
analogies between things,

01:09:02.859 --> 01:09:04.420
and then trying out, oh,
well, if that's right,

01:09:04.420 --> 01:09:06.020
then it would make
this prediction.

01:09:06.020 --> 01:09:08.380
And the kid doesn't have to
be conscious of that the way

01:09:08.380 --> 01:09:10.720
scientists maybe are.

01:09:10.720 --> 01:09:13.990
That process of coming
up with theories

01:09:13.990 --> 01:09:16.630
and considering variations,
trying them out,

01:09:16.630 --> 01:09:19.450
seeing what kinds of new
experiences you can create

01:09:19.450 --> 01:09:20.459
for yourself--

01:09:20.459 --> 01:09:22.000
call them an
experiment, or call them

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.010
just a game, or
playing with a toy,

01:09:24.010 --> 01:09:28.210
but that dynamic is the real
heart of how children learn

01:09:28.210 --> 01:09:30.700
and build the knowledge
from the early stages

01:09:30.700 --> 01:09:33.939
to what we come
to have as adults.

01:09:33.939 --> 01:09:36.640
Those two insights of what we
start with and how we grow,

01:09:36.640 --> 01:09:39.790
I think, are hugely powerful
and hugely important

01:09:39.790 --> 01:09:42.404
for anything we want to do in
capturing-- making machines

01:09:42.404 --> 01:09:43.779
that learn like
humans, or making

01:09:43.779 --> 01:09:46.112
computational models that
really get at the heart of how

01:09:46.112 --> 01:09:47.850
we come to be smart.

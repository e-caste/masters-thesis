00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:26.190
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: Today
we have two guest lecturers.

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:29.820
The one I invited is
Professor Peter Furth.

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.070
He's an expert on
transit signal priority.

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:41.466
His own work on reliability
before time and then how people

00:00:41.466 --> 00:00:42.924
budget for their
travel times, he's

00:00:42.924 --> 00:00:44.790
a really good teacher on that.

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:46.400
And he's also a bike expert.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.233
He's really interested
in all bicycle stuff,

00:00:48.233 --> 00:00:49.920
but let's not do this publicly.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.220
Maybe you can get
him out of this class

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:54.390
and ask him something.

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.550
Then we also have-- he
dragged someone else

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.280
in from the Netherlands who
also knows a lot about transit

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:01.190
signal priorities.

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.780
So I don't really know
what to say about him,

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.274
but we'll find out.

00:01:06.274 --> 00:01:07.440
Maybe you can introduce him.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.023
PETER FURTH: Yeah,
I'll introduce him.

00:01:09.023 --> 00:01:09.810
Yeah, OK.

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:10.350
Hi all.

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:10.680
Thanks.

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:11.670
It's great to be here.

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.050
Before I get into
transit priority,

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:18.900
I just want to tell you a
bit more about my background.

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.990
So, I studied here
at MIT, and my focus

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.030
was on public transportation.

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.250
Then, I became a
professor at Northeastern.

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.295
And after several
years, for one thing

00:01:29.295 --> 00:01:31.420
there weren't enough jobs
in public transportation.

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.360
And my students needed more
training in traffic engineering

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.550
because there were
more jobs in that.

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:39.550
But then the other thing is
that our buses were getting

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:44.079
stuck in traffic all the time,
and I wanted to learn, well,

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:46.120
can't we figure out a way
to make the lights turn

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:47.020
green for a bus.

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.990
I mean if we can get a
man on the moon surely

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.540
we should be able to get the
lights to turn green for a bus.

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.110
So I got the chance to
go to the Netherlands

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.310
for a year, a sabbatical year.

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.210
And almost did a
second PhD there,

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:08.590
studying traffic signal
control for transit priority.

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.789
So you have to learn all
the traffic signal control,

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.910
and then you can learn, OK, now
how do you do transit priority?

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:15.842
Then I came back to
the United States,

00:02:15.842 --> 00:02:17.300
and it took me
several years to try

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.240
to figure out how the Dutch
traffic signal control--

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.240
they use different language
but it's really about the same.

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.780
There are some differences
but it's mostly the same,

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.695
how to say that in American
traffic signal control.

00:02:30.695 --> 00:02:32.570
And since then, I've
done a lot more work now

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:37.580
in traffic signal control
and transit priority.

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.430
So that's how I come here.

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.160
My title is, Is it
help or is it hype?

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:48.950
And I really mean that
because if you go to Zurich

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.590
transit signal
priority is real help.

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.420
I went there once on
an official visit,

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.490
and I told the people
I was visiting,

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:04.820
I came here because I've heard
it said that the trams never

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:06.290
have a red light.

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.430
He said, Yeah, well
that's just about true.

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.750
There are some exceptions
he said, of course,

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.802
like at the main square
there are so many trams.

00:03:13.802 --> 00:03:15.260
They come from
different directions

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.560
so one tram has a red
light for another tram.

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.710
But otherwise, there are
only one or two intersections

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:24.710
in the whole city where
the trams don't just

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:26.075
get a green light.

00:03:26.075 --> 00:03:28.700
I learned that in Portland, when
they designed their light rail

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:33.650
in the 1980s, station
to station green waves

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.710
are programmed into the
traffic signal control.

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:39.830
Now it doesn't mean zero delay
because what that means is when

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:43.010
a light rail train
is at a station,

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:45.649
there'll be a countdown
clock for the driver.

00:03:45.649 --> 00:03:47.690
So there's no point in
leaving now because you're

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:48.773
going to have a red light.

00:03:48.773 --> 00:03:50.870
But if you wait until the
appointed time to leave,

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:57.390
then you will have a green
wave to the next station.

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:00.840
But then we come to
applications of transit signal

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.000
priority in the US.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.990
And you hear these great
pronouncements, oh, we're

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:08.440
doing transit signal priority.

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.850
But when you look into it,
there's almost no benefit.

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:15.150
Sometimes they're saving
the bus two seconds

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.610
per intersection or less.

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:19.269
Often they're not
measuring at all.

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:23.760
So then I have to ask, is it
really a help or is it hype?

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:27.810
And so what I'm going
to tell you today

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:30.090
is some of the standard
ways of doing transit signal

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:32.400
priority, how they
work, and how they

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.620
don't work very [AUDIO OUT]
have to do to really

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:43.780
be able to have our buses or
trams have nearly zero delay.

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:46.630
So before we get
into detail, why

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:48.200
are we doing transit priority?

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:49.990
This is a class on
public transportation

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:53.590
so it probably doesn't
need a lot of argument

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:57.160
but we start with a
societal objective.

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:01.690
Transit offers many
benefits to society

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:04.510
in terms of congestion, air
quality, livable communities,

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:05.680
and so on.

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.610
And transit is mostly
competing with car use.

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:13.620
And what transit can do is
break the vicious cycle.

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:14.690
There's a vicious cycle.

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:16.930
This is especially strong
in developing countries.

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:19.060
Whereas people get
more money, one

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:22.060
of the first things they want
to buy when they have more money

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:23.020
is a car.

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:26.920
And then with the car the
car roads become congested

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:28.480
and then that
slows down transit.

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:31.090
So then people don't
want to use transit

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:33.820
so then they get more cars
and it just keeps going.

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:38.950
If you can do priority
for a bus, then

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:41.200
that breaks that cycle
and now people will say,

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:44.930
I'm going to use the bus or
the train to have priority.

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:51.770
And then having priority for
transit makes a lot of sense

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:58.400
because the tradition in Boston
has been a very extreme all

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.020
or nothing priority.

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:02.690
We know one way to
give transit priority.

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:04.970
Total grade separation.

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:10.460
We build a subway, and they're
protected from congestion.

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:13.930
So we know how to do
the $2 billion priority

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:17.170
and we also know the other
extreme, which is nothing.

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:18.910
Buses you're welcome
to use our roads.

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:21.610
I mean when the light turns
green everybody else can go,

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:23.780
I guess you can too.

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:27.160
It doesn't make sense to
only have those two extremes.

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:30.130
And that's what the
city of Zurich did.

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:34.750
The main planners for Zurich
wanted to build a subway.

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:36.190
This was in the 1970s.

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:38.620
Big cities that didn't
have subway systems

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:40.060
then were building them.

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:45.852
But the citizens said, no,
spend a tenth of the money--

00:06:45.852 --> 00:06:47.560
because subways are
incredibly expensive,

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:49.660
spend about a
tenth of that money

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:53.680
to give our trams
priority, and then we

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:56.270
don't have to walk
down in the basement.

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:59.830
And instead we like how
the trams are right.

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:01.900
It's almost like an
extension of the sidewalk.

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:05.140
You just step on,
ride, step off.

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:08.800
So it makes sense to have
some means of priority that's

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:11.360
in between all or nothing.

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:13.380
And we have two ways
of doing priority.

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:14.860
It's priority in space.

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:19.480
That means you give the buses
or the trams their own lane,

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:20.420
their own space.

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:22.360
And then there's
priority at time,

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:26.340
which comes at traffic signals.

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:31.790
Priority, it's easy to see what
it means to a transit user.

00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:35.210
It means you get a faster
ride and a more reliable ride.

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:38.120
So it saves you time.

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:41.900
The reliability means it also
saves you in buffer time.

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:44.300
But it's important to know
what transit priority means

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:45.950
to a transit operator.

00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:47.990
The savings in time
means they might

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:54.170
be able to run their route with
fewer vehicles and less labor.

00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:56.540
And the improved
reliability means

00:07:56.540 --> 00:08:01.100
they don't have to have
as much recovery time.

00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:07.800
So in Portland they had a
case at Tri-Mat Line 12.

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:10.751
The transit priority they put in
didn't reduce the running time

00:08:10.751 --> 00:08:11.250
that much.

00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:13.920
But it reduced the
variability of running time

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:18.810
so much that they were
able to reduce the cycle

00:08:18.810 --> 00:08:22.140
time by 11 minutes.

00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:24.930
And if you reduce the cycle
time by 11 minutes on a route

00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:27.360
that runs every 11
minutes or every--

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:31.730
then you save one
bus and one operator.

00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:35.049
And that lowers your
cost tremendously.

00:08:35.049 --> 00:08:37.260
So priority is important
for passengers,

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:40.690
it's important for the operator.

00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:48.770
And I told you I studied traffic
signals in the Netherlands

00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:53.660
and it was in the context
of transit priority--

00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:55.590
how can we make
transit service better?

00:08:55.590 --> 00:09:01.760
So here you have two
graphs, each line

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:04.310
represents the
trajectory of a vehicle.

00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:05.810
On the bottom is space.

00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:09.200
We're going from station
CL across to station S.

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:12.260
And on the vertical axis is
how far off schedule are we?

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.930
So if you're at the
0 line, that means

00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:17.790
you're perfectly on schedule.

00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:24.600
And as you go above the line,
you're earlier and earlier.

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:27.720
And as you go below the
line your later and later.

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:30.810
So this is what the
operation was, kind of

00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:33.510
if you just let it be.

00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:35.642
The buses will start
pretty close to on time

00:09:35.642 --> 00:09:38.100
but they got later and later
and later, and the spread just

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:39.391
gets worse and worse and worse.

00:09:39.391 --> 00:09:40.680
This is nothing new.

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:42.690
If you know about
transit service

00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:47.700
you know how there's
these random shocks

00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:48.617
could make a bus late.

00:09:48.617 --> 00:09:51.033
And once you're late you become
later and later and later.

00:09:51.033 --> 00:09:53.320
And once you're early you
become earlier and earlier

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:53.850
and earlier.

00:09:53.850 --> 00:09:58.544
But here they put in
a system with priority

00:09:58.544 --> 00:09:59.460
at the traffic lights.

00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:02.130
And it's conditional priority.

00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:06.630
If the bus is early, no priority
for you but if the bus is late,

00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:09.090
we're going to give
very aggressive priority

00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:11.880
so that bus can cruise right
through the intersection.

00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:14.970
So if the average time to
get through an intersection

00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:18.000
is let's say half a
minute, but with priority

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.700
that's going to be 10
seconds and without priority

00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:22.320
that's going to be 50 seconds.

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:26.760
That's a 40 second
difference that I

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:30.390
can make my bus 20 seconds
later by not giving it priority.

00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:33.960
I can make my bus 50 seconds
earlier by giving it priority.

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:36.990
So with that you see how
much tighter the lines are,

00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:40.920
how much better
the reliability is

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:44.970
because the priority system
is able to keep those buses

00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:45.910
right on schedule.

00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:46.110
Yeah.

00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:48.109
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
people driving on the road

00:10:48.109 --> 00:10:49.975
would have to use
that traffic light

00:10:49.975 --> 00:10:52.584
and they know it normally
takes them 30 seconds and all

00:10:52.584 --> 00:10:56.210
of a sudden it's 50 seconds
or is this a separate thing?

00:10:56.210 --> 00:10:59.300
PETER FURTH: No,
this is not let's

00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:01.280
hold the light red extra long.

00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:04.550
This is just we won't
give priority, that's all.

00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:08.480
So, yeah when I say we
won't give priority,

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:11.130
I'm not talking about holding.

00:11:11.130 --> 00:11:13.170
So we're not deliberately
holding the light red.

00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:16.920
It's just, if the bus arrives in
the light is green, OK bus you

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:17.670
get to go through.

00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:19.381
But if you arrive
when it's red, I'm

00:11:19.381 --> 00:11:21.630
not going to hurry up and
turn the light green for you

00:11:21.630 --> 00:11:22.650
if you're early.

00:11:22.650 --> 00:11:24.358
I'm only going to do
that if you're late.

00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:32.050
And priority makes
transit more competitive

00:11:32.050 --> 00:11:36.340
because after all if transit
has to stop to pick people up,

00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:40.060
that slows it down, you have to
walk to get to the station that

00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:41.350
adds more travel time.

00:11:41.350 --> 00:11:43.330
How can we compete with car?

00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:48.537
Well one way we can compete is
we can give transit priority

00:11:48.537 --> 00:11:49.870
and it makes it more acceptable.

00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:52.180
And because I got late, I
get don't get to tell you

00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:55.120
the story about my great aunt.

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:58.840
So there are different
levels of priority.

00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:00.940
One of the things you'll
often hear if you ever

00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:03.040
hear a presentation about
priority, they'll say,

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:05.170
it's not preemption.

00:12:05.170 --> 00:12:09.520
Preemption is a technical term
in traffic signal control,

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:13.770
and preemption is what
we'll do for a fire truck.

00:12:13.770 --> 00:12:18.150
And that just means oh,
preempt the signal, just stop.

00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:22.530
Every conflicting movement
goes to yellow, goes to red,

00:12:22.530 --> 00:12:25.820
and we just stop everything so
the fire truck can go through.

00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:29.160
And by the way the street
that the fire truck is on we

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:33.952
don't turn that one red, we
would make that one green.

00:12:33.952 --> 00:12:35.910
It's not like we ask
everybody to pull over out

00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:37.118
of the way of the fire truck.

00:12:37.118 --> 00:12:39.630
We ask everybody just keep
driving, go, go, go, go, go,

00:12:39.630 --> 00:12:40.170
go, go.

00:12:40.170 --> 00:12:41.940
Give them green
wave, go, go, go,

00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:44.400
and then the fire
engine comes along.

00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:45.930
So that's preemption.

00:12:45.930 --> 00:12:47.310
We do that for fire engines.

00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:52.860
And we do that for trains
because trains can't brake.

00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:56.280
You get a train coming along
at 40, 50 miles an hour,

00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:58.320
trains-- that steel
wheel on steel rail,

00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:01.060
they can't brake very quickly.

00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:05.580
So we will preempt
a light for a train.

00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:08.340
So priority is something
short of preemption.

00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:11.970
For instance, with
transit priority

00:13:11.970 --> 00:13:14.205
we will not cut off
a pedestrian phase.

00:13:17.470 --> 00:13:19.320
There's a certain
clearance for pedestrians

00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:20.940
to be able to cross the street.

00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:23.250
You've seen the
countdown signals.

00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:25.990
So for a fire engine
they'll just--

00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:30.710
it could be 15, 14, 0.

00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:34.190
But we won't do
that for transit.

00:13:34.190 --> 00:13:41.060
And preemption it doesn't
think a moment about the impact

00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:42.520
on the other traffic.

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:44.286
We got to save a life.

00:13:44.286 --> 00:13:46.160
Somebody's life is at
stake, somebody's house

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:48.020
is burning down,
and there's a train

00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:50.160
coming that would kill
everybody in its way.

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:53.120
So when it comes to saving a
life you don't worry about,

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:56.540
is it costing people a few
extra seconds, minutes of time?

00:13:56.540 --> 00:13:59.090
But transit priority
we're going to give

00:13:59.090 --> 00:14:02.390
priority to transit vehicle
every five minutes every,

00:14:02.390 --> 00:14:03.650
three minutes.

00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:05.330
You can't be
completely disrupting

00:14:05.330 --> 00:14:08.300
and screwing up traffic
every three minutes.

00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:11.420
You have to think about
how it affects others.

00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:14.424
So there are some
standard tactics.

00:14:14.424 --> 00:14:16.340
The main ones I'll talk
about are listed here.

00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:18.920
Green extension and
early green, but I'll

00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:22.640
also talked about some
more intelligent tactics

00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:24.740
and some ways of
changing the background.

00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:31.080
So let's look at the most
popular tactic, which

00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:33.330
is green extension.

00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:37.140
Green extension means the
street that the bus is on,

00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:38.870
the light is green.

00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:42.440
It's about to turn
yellow, but we detect,

00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:45.950
oh, there's a bus coming and
it's only 12 seconds away.

00:14:45.950 --> 00:14:48.950
All right, then we'll
just delay turning yellow.

00:14:48.950 --> 00:14:51.350
We'll just extend the
green, and then the bus

00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:52.940
will come right through.

00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:57.360
And then the light can
turn yellow and turn red.

00:14:57.360 --> 00:15:02.360
So that offers, as I have
there on the slide, a very

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:07.680
large benefit to the buses
who take advantage of this.

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:11.510
I mean, because the bus who
gets the green extension, that's

00:15:11.510 --> 00:15:14.090
the bus that if they
didn't get that extension

00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:17.060
they would arrive right
near the beginning of red.

00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:19.480
And they'd have the longest
wait of anybody in the cycle.

00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:22.430
They'd have to wait whole red
period until they can finally

00:15:22.430 --> 00:15:23.700
go on.

00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:25.730
So if the red period
is 70 seconds long,

00:15:25.730 --> 00:15:28.810
you just save that
bus about 70 seconds.

00:15:28.810 --> 00:15:32.170
So it's a very large benefit,
but it's a benefit only

00:15:32.170 --> 00:15:33.910
to a few buses.

00:15:33.910 --> 00:15:37.690
Because which buses get
to enjoy that benefit?

00:15:37.690 --> 00:15:42.370
Only the ones arriving during
the first few seconds of red.

00:15:42.370 --> 00:15:45.730
Let's say you're willing to give
a 15 second green extension,

00:15:45.730 --> 00:15:49.720
then any bus arriving in the
first 15 seconds of red that

00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:50.950
gets a benefit.

00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:53.680
But if the cycle
is 100 seconds long

00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:56.500
and buses arrive at random,
well that's only 15%

00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:59.000
of the arrivals that
are in that window.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.740
So green extension
is a large benefit

00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:05.410
but to a small number of buses.

00:16:05.410 --> 00:16:08.470
And we can model that
benefit this way.

00:16:11.444 --> 00:16:16.520
On the horizontal axis
is time in the cycle.

00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:23.360
And on the vertical
axis, I have arrivals

00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:25.760
and so you have cumulative
vehicles arriving.

00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:29.890
And then the red lines
going across, that's--

00:16:29.890 --> 00:16:31.156
you're raising your hand?

00:16:31.156 --> 00:16:31.520
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:32.270
PETER FURTH: Yeah.

00:16:32.270 --> 00:16:33.979
AUDIENCE: So but
now that you said,

00:16:33.979 --> 00:16:36.020
it's a large benefit to
a small number of buses--

00:16:36.020 --> 00:16:36.780
PETER FURTH: Yeah.

00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:39.440
AUDIENCE: --per intersection
because if the whole bus run

00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:45.080
is 10-20 signal
intersection, then over time

00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:48.070
the probability of every single
bus enjoying that and every bus

00:16:48.070 --> 00:16:49.441
that runs [INAUDIBLE]

00:16:49.441 --> 00:16:50.190
PETER FURTH: Sure.

00:16:50.190 --> 00:16:50.815
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:16:50.815 --> 00:16:53.630
You say it's only 15% of
buses, it's actually a lot more

00:16:53.630 --> 00:16:54.260
and it's--

00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:57.135
PETER FURTH: So let's say 15%
of bus arrivals at a signal.

00:16:57.135 --> 00:16:58.260
AUDIENCE: At a signal but--

00:16:58.260 --> 00:16:58.410
PETER FURTH: Yeah.

00:16:58.410 --> 00:16:59.260
AUDIENCE: --over
a lot of signals?

00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:00.100
PETER FURTH: Yeah.

00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:00.600
Yeah.

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:03.490
If I'm running a route in which
I'm going through 20 signals

00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:06.704
and I'm going to get the benefit
of 15% of them on average,

00:17:06.704 --> 00:17:08.329
I'll get that benefit,
well, that would

00:17:08.329 --> 00:17:10.670
be three times 15% of 20.

00:17:10.670 --> 00:17:11.810
Yeah.

00:17:11.810 --> 00:17:17.380
So the red lines here
represent the time

00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:18.940
that a person is in the queue.

00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:23.619
So like the car arrival--

00:17:23.619 --> 00:17:25.720
here's arrival
number one and then

00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:27.369
this line is the
departure curve.

00:17:27.369 --> 00:17:30.430
Cars arrive at a
relatively slow rate,

00:17:30.430 --> 00:17:32.830
let's say one car
every five seconds.

00:17:32.830 --> 00:17:36.250
And they pull out at a much
faster rate, say one car

00:17:36.250 --> 00:17:38.300
every two seconds.

00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:43.690
So each horizontal line
represents a certain vehicle.

00:17:43.690 --> 00:17:47.950
So let's say the vehicle
number two arrives here.

00:17:47.950 --> 00:17:50.950
And vehicle number two
doesn't depart until here.

00:17:50.950 --> 00:17:53.830
So that horizontal line
is the waiting time

00:17:53.830 --> 00:17:54.790
of vehicle number two.

00:17:54.790 --> 00:17:58.570
So in this representation,
horizontal distance

00:17:58.570 --> 00:18:00.190
is waiting time.

00:18:00.190 --> 00:18:04.570
So for the bus with
a green extension,

00:18:04.570 --> 00:18:08.680
instead of red starting
at times throw,

00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:11.290
the red actually doesn't
start until here.

00:18:11.290 --> 00:18:15.130
So a bus that would have
arrived and had been delayed,

00:18:15.130 --> 00:18:16.690
now those buses aren't--

00:18:16.690 --> 00:18:19.690
buses that arrive after
the extension time

00:18:19.690 --> 00:18:20.980
still are delayed.

00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:28.930
So the possibility
for delay, which

00:18:28.930 --> 00:18:31.970
is represented by the red
area, there is less of it.

00:18:31.970 --> 00:18:37.450
And you find the average
horizontal length

00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:39.100
between these lines.

00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:43.450
And then you do a
little bit of geometry.

00:18:43.450 --> 00:18:48.350
And we find that the expected
delay in the first case,

00:18:48.350 --> 00:18:51.200
this is the standard
delay for cars,

00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:54.890
has to do with the length of
the [AUDIO OUT] car, the cycle

00:18:54.890 --> 00:18:59.090
length, C, and the ratio
of the arrival rate

00:18:59.090 --> 00:19:02.090
to the discharge
rate, that's v over s.

00:19:02.090 --> 00:19:04.340
And when we put in
a green extension,

00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:08.430
we have that same term
minus this term here.

00:19:08.430 --> 00:19:10.670
And I give that the
name the priority push.

00:19:10.670 --> 00:19:18.190
So that's the reduction in
delay thanks to green extension.

00:19:18.190 --> 00:19:20.680
And that reduction
in delay has to do

00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:23.710
with how long an extension
are you willing to give.

00:19:23.710 --> 00:19:26.320
In some places though
they say, well, I'm

00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:28.480
willing to extend
for 10 seconds.

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:30.700
In Toronto, they often
say, I'm willing to extend

00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:33.050
for 30 seconds.

00:19:33.050 --> 00:19:37.100
So it depends on how
long is your extension.

00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:40.280
But it also depends a lot
on how long is your red

00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:42.750
and how long is your cycle.

00:19:42.750 --> 00:19:45.680
So just so you can
have some numbers of--

00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:46.306
Yeah.

00:19:46.306 --> 00:19:46.972
AUDIENCE: Sorry.

00:19:46.972 --> 00:19:57.390
[INAUDIBLE] why is the order
[INAUDIBLE] assigned to that?

00:19:57.390 --> 00:20:02.220
PETER FURTH: So this line here?

00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:02.844
AUDIENCE: Mhm.

00:20:02.844 --> 00:20:03.510
PETER FURTH: OK.

00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:09.910
So that represents the
cumulative departing cars, OK?

00:20:09.910 --> 00:20:13.309
So at a certain point in
time, the light turns green

00:20:13.309 --> 00:20:14.600
and then the first car departs.

00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:17.420
The second car doesn't depart
until about two seconds later.

00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:19.110
The cars follow one another.

00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:24.560
So this line has a
slope of about one car

00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:27.170
every two seconds
as they depart.

00:20:27.170 --> 00:20:28.500
This is as they arrive.

00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:34.160
It's maybe one car every five,
six, seven, eight seconds, OK?

00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:36.890
And where the two
lines meet, that

00:20:36.890 --> 00:20:40.610
means the last car in
the queue is now gone.

00:20:40.610 --> 00:20:48.350
And after that, as cars arrive
and depart without any joining

00:20:48.350 --> 00:20:51.970
acuity, just go through.

00:20:51.970 --> 00:20:55.420
So to put some numbers
on that priority push,

00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:58.420
let's consider a sort
of typical intersection

00:20:58.420 --> 00:21:00.610
with a cycle length
of 100 seconds,

00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:04.810
50 seconds of red
time, and the v over s.

00:21:04.810 --> 00:21:08.260
That v over s term is such
that the degree of saturation

00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:11.600
is 85% which that's
pretty typical.

00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:14.170
So this shows how the
priority push varies

00:21:14.170 --> 00:21:15.700
with the green extension.

00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:18.310
The longer an extension
you're willing to give

00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:19.760
the more of a priority push.

00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:22.640
But notice they're not
equal to each other.

00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:25.840
For instance, when the green
extension is 15 seconds

00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:29.180
that gives me a priority
push of about eight seconds.

00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:35.740
So often if anybody does try to
describe the priority tactics

00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:38.000
they're using, they'll say
something like, oh, when we

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.279
give 15 second green extension.

00:21:41.279 --> 00:21:43.570
Well that doesn't mean it's
going to speed the buses up

00:21:43.570 --> 00:21:46.180
by 15 seconds.

00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:50.470
In this case, how it
affects each individual bus

00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:56.290
varies but on average that will
reduce the delay of buses--

00:21:56.290 --> 00:21:59.710
this is averaged over all
buses, reduce the delay

00:21:59.710 --> 00:22:01.330
by eight seconds.

00:22:01.330 --> 00:22:04.870
And then it has a lot to
do also with the cycling.

00:22:04.870 --> 00:22:08.680
So let's again consider
100 second cycle,

00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:10.210
degree saturation 85.

00:22:10.210 --> 00:22:14.080
This time hold the
green extension period

00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:15.760
fixed to 15 seconds.

00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:20.080
And look at different
amounts of red time.

00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:24.130
So if you're red
time is low, that's

00:22:24.130 --> 00:22:26.200
like the buses on
the through road that

00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:27.465
gets green most of the time.

00:22:27.465 --> 00:22:30.090
We're green most of the time and
only a small part of the cycle

00:22:30.090 --> 00:22:31.720
is for the cross street.

00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:34.750
Well then the priority
push is pretty small,

00:22:34.750 --> 00:22:36.460
only about five seconds.

00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:41.170
But if the red time is long,
if it's 100 second cycle

00:22:41.170 --> 00:22:45.640
and the light is red for you
90 out of those 100 seconds,

00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:51.850
well then getting pushed ahead
15 seconds will save you a lot.

00:22:51.850 --> 00:22:57.460
Now when is the light red
for 90 out of 100 seconds?

00:22:57.460 --> 00:23:00.190
Under what kind of
traffic movement

00:23:00.190 --> 00:23:03.340
would it be that is
red almost all the time

00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:04.390
with a very short green?

00:23:04.390 --> 00:23:09.201
AUDIENCE: Maybe like a city
center pedestrian plaza?

00:23:09.201 --> 00:23:10.450
PETER FURTH: No, probably not.

00:23:10.450 --> 00:23:12.444
Because if you only
give the cars 10 seconds

00:23:12.444 --> 00:23:14.110
you just can't get
much traffic through.

00:23:14.110 --> 00:23:14.610
Yeah?

00:23:14.610 --> 00:23:16.240
AUDIENCE: D street
in South Boston.

00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:18.250
PETER FURTH: Ho, ho,
ho, ho, ho you got it.

00:23:18.250 --> 00:23:19.390
You got it.

00:23:19.390 --> 00:23:22.303
But that's not a typical case.

00:23:22.303 --> 00:23:26.584
AUDIENCE: The cross streets
of a major thoroughfare?

00:23:26.584 --> 00:23:28.000
PETER FURTH: So
the cross streets,

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.925
even they get more
like 25-30 seconds.

00:23:30.925 --> 00:23:32.830
AUDIENCE: Like a
protected class.

00:23:32.830 --> 00:23:34.870
PETER FURTH: A left
turn, that's it.

00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:37.450
This is the one that
really, really could

00:23:37.450 --> 00:23:40.990
benefit from a green extension.

00:23:40.990 --> 00:23:44.830
So right next to Northeastern
is Ruggles Station,

00:23:44.830 --> 00:23:47.710
and you got all these
buses making left turns.

00:23:47.710 --> 00:23:50.840
And if they don't
make it, uh sorry,

00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:57.600
120 second cycle,
100 seconds of red.

00:23:57.600 --> 00:24:02.830
So that's a situation where
a green extension would be--

00:24:02.830 --> 00:24:07.550
it's valuable in all these cases
but it's especially valuable

00:24:07.550 --> 00:24:11.150
when there's a
really long red time.

00:24:11.150 --> 00:24:13.550
So I'm glad you
mentioned D Street.

00:24:13.550 --> 00:24:15.080
I'll be talking about D Street.

00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:17.300
All right.

00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:20.570
OK, how do we do detection?

00:24:20.570 --> 00:24:24.514
Technically to detect the
bus, it's almost trivial.

00:24:24.514 --> 00:24:26.180
There's so many
different ways to do it.

00:24:30.370 --> 00:24:34.870
I'll say something about
technologies, but where

00:24:34.870 --> 00:24:36.130
we want to detect the bus.

00:24:36.130 --> 00:24:39.280
So we want to have a check-in
detector so the bus reports in.

00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:40.330
Hello, I'm a bus.

00:24:40.330 --> 00:24:42.840
Can you give me priority?

00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:44.670
And there is a trade-off.

00:24:44.670 --> 00:24:47.700
The sooner we know,
the better because then

00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:50.460
we can prepare for it and
get that light to be red.

00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:54.810
But if you tell me
two minutes in advance

00:24:54.810 --> 00:24:59.010
there's a bus coming, bus travel
time is not deterministic.

00:24:59.010 --> 00:24:59.510
All right?

00:24:59.510 --> 00:25:03.680
So there might be stops in
between and random dwell time.

00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:05.770
There might be other
traffic signals in between.

00:25:05.770 --> 00:25:11.210
So usually we want
our check-in to be

00:25:11.210 --> 00:25:15.260
as far away as can be but no
farther than the next stop

00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:17.810
or the next intersection
so there's a pretty

00:25:17.810 --> 00:25:22.070
deterministic travel time.

00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:24.460
We also want there to
be a check-out detector.

00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:27.320
Some systems omit the
check-out detector.

00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:30.750
So if you omit the
check-out detector,

00:25:30.750 --> 00:25:32.520
here's how inefficient you are.

00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:34.270
You say, oh, there's
a bus coming.

00:25:34.270 --> 00:25:36.760
I'll give it a 15
second extension.

00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:38.860
The bus goes through
after three seconds,

00:25:38.860 --> 00:25:41.754
and you still hold the
light green for the full 15.

00:25:41.754 --> 00:25:42.920
That doesn't make any sense.

00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:44.830
So have a check-out detector.

00:25:44.830 --> 00:25:46.780
As soon as the
bus hits that, you

00:25:46.780 --> 00:25:50.710
cancel the extension request,
let the light turn yellow.

00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:57.040
The traditional
technology for extension

00:25:57.040 --> 00:26:00.610
is we bury in the
ground a loop--

00:26:00.610 --> 00:26:03.100
not just a dumb loop
of cable but a loop

00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:04.460
that acts like an antenna.

00:26:04.460 --> 00:26:09.310
So the bus is coming along,
giving along a very low energy

00:26:09.310 --> 00:26:09.820
signal.

00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:10.690
I'm a bus.

00:26:10.690 --> 00:26:14.800
I'm bus number 2356 so you
can check my ID to make sure

00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:18.580
that this is not a stolen unit.

00:26:18.580 --> 00:26:20.320
And it could give
off some information

00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:23.290
like, I'm turning left
so I need the left arrow.

00:26:23.290 --> 00:26:27.190
There's another bus route coming
along that's going straight.

00:26:27.190 --> 00:26:29.920
So that's one way of doing it.

00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:36.640
Nowadays, we'll be doing it with
GPS and basically cell phone

00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:38.280
technology, texting.

00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:41.809
The bus sets up text messages
with the controller and says,

00:26:41.809 --> 00:26:43.850
here are my coordinates,
here are my coordinates,

00:26:43.850 --> 00:26:47.740
and just keep sending
essentially the packets of cell

00:26:47.740 --> 00:26:50.800
data like text messages.

00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:55.150
And then we know where the bus
is, and we can take action.

00:26:57.660 --> 00:26:59.960
So I can skip that.

00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:04.190
So one difficulty
of giving priority

00:27:04.190 --> 00:27:07.240
is, well, what if
there's a near side stop?

00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:11.030
If you looked at
locating stops for buses,

00:27:11.030 --> 00:27:14.360
you know there's a basic
choice between the near side,

00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:18.420
the upstream side
intersection or the far side.

00:27:18.420 --> 00:27:20.180
Well, if you're
on the near side,

00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:23.300
remember stop dwell
time is random.

00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:25.280
So I don't even want
to check the bus

00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:27.590
in until it's left the stop.

00:27:27.590 --> 00:27:29.330
Well, that means
my check-in point

00:27:29.330 --> 00:27:31.310
is going to be awfully close.

00:27:31.310 --> 00:27:31.820
So what?

00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:35.230
I'm going to find out two
seconds before the bus comes

00:27:35.230 --> 00:27:37.250
that a bus is coming?

00:27:37.250 --> 00:27:39.840
If you only have two
seconds advance notice,

00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:43.654
how long a green
extension can you give?

00:27:43.654 --> 00:27:44.650
AUDIENCE: Two seconds.

00:27:44.650 --> 00:27:45.691
PETER FURTH: Two seconds.

00:27:45.691 --> 00:27:46.900
Think about it.

00:27:46.900 --> 00:27:49.600
You can't give a
15 second extension

00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:53.500
if you're only detecting the
bus two seconds early, right?

00:27:53.500 --> 00:27:56.290
If I was going to end
the green at time--

00:27:56.290 --> 00:27:58.980
let's just pick a
number at time 50

00:27:58.980 --> 00:28:02.580
and I said, oh, I'm willing
to wait till time 65.

00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:05.700
But I don't know when the
bus is there until time 63,

00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:08.290
how would I know to
extend the green?

00:28:08.290 --> 00:28:08.790
Yeah.

00:28:08.790 --> 00:28:13.270
You cannot give a green
extension longer than

00:28:13.270 --> 00:28:16.310
the advance notice
that you have.

00:28:16.310 --> 00:28:19.240
So this is a killer.

00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:19.740
Yeah.

00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:21.948
AUDIENCE: I'm just curious
about the actual mechanics

00:28:21.948 --> 00:28:23.170
of the signal extension.

00:28:23.170 --> 00:28:23.410
PETER FURTH: Yeah.

00:28:23.410 --> 00:28:24.785
AUDIENCE: Is this
a signal you're

00:28:24.785 --> 00:28:27.370
sending to just that one
traffic intersection or are you

00:28:27.370 --> 00:28:29.330
sending a signal to some
central control that's

00:28:29.330 --> 00:28:31.690
controlling the whole
city's traffic lights?

00:28:31.690 --> 00:28:33.070
PETER FURTH: A single place.

00:28:33.070 --> 00:28:35.650
Now, it can work through
the central place,

00:28:35.650 --> 00:28:39.600
but I'm talking
about, yeah, a bus

00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:43.280
is detected for a
particular light,

00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:46.590
hold that particular
light green for me.

00:28:46.590 --> 00:28:50.450
It doesn't do anything to
any other intersection.

00:28:50.450 --> 00:28:52.346
AUDIENCE: But I meant
does it send a signal

00:28:52.346 --> 00:28:54.470
to some central control
which then tells that light

00:28:54.470 --> 00:28:57.320
to change?

00:28:57.320 --> 00:28:59.130
PETER FURTH: That's an option.

00:28:59.130 --> 00:29:03.930
So in Zurich, yes, they
do that but man you need

00:29:03.930 --> 00:29:05.180
all kinds of cabling for that.

00:29:05.180 --> 00:29:11.420
In Zurich the controllers on
the street are 100% slaves.

00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:13.910
All they do is, when
the central computer

00:29:13.910 --> 00:29:16.850
tells them to change from green
to yellow they just say, yes.

00:29:16.850 --> 00:29:19.220
And the only other software
they have running in them

00:29:19.220 --> 00:29:23.630
is some kind of checking to
make sure that they're not

00:29:23.630 --> 00:29:24.590
violating something.

00:29:24.590 --> 00:29:29.760
But that's a very unusual
setup that was done ages ago.

00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:32.690
Nowadays we have very
reliable microcomputers

00:29:32.690 --> 00:29:34.130
in the controllers.

00:29:34.130 --> 00:29:37.070
So the central
computer will make

00:29:37.070 --> 00:29:40.940
sure every intersection
is on the clock,

00:29:40.940 --> 00:29:43.730
every intersection is supposed
to have its certain offset--

00:29:43.730 --> 00:29:47.310
you turn green at a
certain time in the cycle.

00:29:47.310 --> 00:29:49.980
And it will give them
the basic parameters--

00:29:49.980 --> 00:29:53.690
30 seconds for this street,
20 seconds for this phase,

00:29:53.690 --> 00:29:55.790
20 seconds for this
phase, and so on.

00:29:55.790 --> 00:29:57.650
And it will say,
and you're allowed

00:29:57.650 --> 00:30:00.530
to give a 15 second
green extension.

00:30:00.530 --> 00:30:02.840
And then it's the
local controller

00:30:02.840 --> 00:30:05.900
that will actually do it.

00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:06.639
Yeah.

00:30:06.639 --> 00:30:12.280
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] means
that the detector is right there

00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:13.940
at the intersection?

00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:16.190
PETER FURTH: Well it means
that the stop is just

00:30:16.190 --> 00:30:17.240
before the intersection.

00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:18.720
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:21.110
PETER FURTH: So if
I put my detector--

00:30:21.110 --> 00:30:24.380
normally, let's say I want to
give a 15 second extension,

00:30:24.380 --> 00:30:28.910
I locate my detector 15 seconds
upstream of the traffic light.

00:30:28.910 --> 00:30:31.760
Well, what's 15
seconds ahead when

00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:34.420
there is a dwell time in there?

00:30:34.420 --> 00:30:39.840
So you know how random
dwell times are, right?

00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:43.409
Are there going to be one,
two, five people getting off?

00:30:43.409 --> 00:30:44.700
How many people are getting on?

00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:48.270
Maybe somebody who needs
assistance or having

00:30:48.270 --> 00:30:51.140
trouble with their fares.

00:30:51.140 --> 00:30:55.884
So because of that we won't
usually call for an extension

00:30:55.884 --> 00:30:57.800
if there is a stop in
between because we don't

00:30:57.800 --> 00:30:59.091
know how long it's going to be.

00:30:59.091 --> 00:31:07.230
So near side stops, not entirely
but they get some benefit.

00:31:07.230 --> 00:31:10.670
If the bus is pulling out
two seconds of extension,

00:31:10.670 --> 00:31:13.860
that's nice but it's
only two seconds.

00:31:13.860 --> 00:31:16.200
So it nearly kills
the effectiveness

00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:17.940
of green extension.

00:31:17.940 --> 00:31:21.864
So that's a reason if you
want to do transit priority,

00:31:21.864 --> 00:31:23.280
you review your
route and you say,

00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:26.830
can I move the stops
to the far side.

00:31:26.830 --> 00:31:29.980
There are a lot of other reasons
to move stops to the far side.

00:31:29.980 --> 00:31:33.250
Transit agencies around
the country where they can

00:31:33.250 --> 00:31:34.840
are moving stops
to the far side.

00:31:34.840 --> 00:31:36.970
So in the NBTA recently
they did a review

00:31:36.970 --> 00:31:38.260
of all their key routes.

00:31:38.260 --> 00:31:41.650
And one thing they looked at
is, can we relocate stops?

00:31:41.650 --> 00:31:43.690
But they have criteria--

00:31:43.690 --> 00:31:47.230
where there's a stop there has
to be a level landing place.

00:31:47.230 --> 00:31:50.500
There can't be fire hydrants
and telephone poles in the way.

00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:53.440
There can't be driveways.

00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:57.430
So some of the streets that
I've looked at for, could we

00:31:57.430 --> 00:32:01.090
do transit priority, and first
thing I would say, oh no, it's

00:32:01.090 --> 00:32:02.170
a near side stop.

00:32:02.170 --> 00:32:04.582
We've got to move it to the
other side of the street.

00:32:04.582 --> 00:32:06.040
But on the other
side of the street

00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:07.840
there's a driveway
every 30 feet,

00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:10.210
you can't put a bus stop there.

00:32:10.210 --> 00:32:13.550
Or there's a firehouse, you
can't put a bus stop there.

00:32:13.550 --> 00:32:16.870
So sometimes we're stuck
with near side stops.

00:32:16.870 --> 00:32:18.926
And then green
extension just ain't

00:32:18.926 --> 00:32:20.050
going to help us very much.

00:32:25.250 --> 00:32:25.750
OK.

00:32:25.750 --> 00:32:33.720
Before I go into
more tactics, let

00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:37.080
me go through this list
of common weaknesses

00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:38.680
in trying to do it.

00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:42.540
So one weakness that I've
seen a lot here in the US

00:32:42.540 --> 00:32:45.270
is what I call
cautious priority.

00:32:45.270 --> 00:32:49.240
So all this equipment they
put in this transit priority

00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:49.740
system.

00:32:49.740 --> 00:32:52.110
But the traffic engineers
are so afraid it's

00:32:52.110 --> 00:32:54.930
going to screw up
traffic that they'll say,

00:32:54.930 --> 00:32:56.760
once we give
priority to a bus we

00:32:56.760 --> 00:32:58.710
inhibit the whole
system for five minutes

00:32:58.710 --> 00:33:01.050
to give the signal
a chance to recover

00:33:01.050 --> 00:33:03.840
or we inhibit at least
for another cycle.

00:33:06.820 --> 00:33:12.370
Or if the traffic level on
the cross street is too much,

00:33:12.370 --> 00:33:15.870
just turn off the
signal priorities.

00:33:15.870 --> 00:33:16.370
OK.

00:33:16.370 --> 00:33:20.510
So the Silver Line running
on Washington Street

00:33:20.510 --> 00:33:22.190
has a priority system.

00:33:26.310 --> 00:33:29.040
Some of the cross streets
have so much traffic

00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:31.950
that they have this rule--
if the cross street volume is

00:33:31.950 --> 00:33:32.940
too much, turn it off.

00:33:32.940 --> 00:33:34.140
Well it's turned off, OK.

00:33:34.140 --> 00:33:36.420
So the bus never gets
priority at Melnea Cass,

00:33:36.420 --> 00:33:39.660
it never gets
priority at Mass Ave.

00:33:39.660 --> 00:33:42.630
Many of the cross streets
bus has the green light

00:33:42.630 --> 00:33:45.180
for like 70 out of 90
seconds in the cycle.

00:33:45.180 --> 00:33:47.280
So it's almost always
green so the bus almost

00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:48.370
never needs priority.

00:33:48.370 --> 00:33:53.460
So there is priority, but
the benefit is very time.

00:33:53.460 --> 00:33:56.002
So in the end, what do you get?

00:33:56.002 --> 00:33:56.960
You get almost nothing.

00:34:00.140 --> 00:34:04.880
And then a second
weakness is not

00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:07.910
thinking about the impact
of priority on traffic

00:34:07.910 --> 00:34:09.889
and then unnecessarily
hurting traffic,

00:34:09.889 --> 00:34:13.669
like not having a check-out
detector that I mentioned.

00:34:13.669 --> 00:34:16.880
But the second
bullet there, that's

00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:21.840
an important one I want you to
think about, is compensation.

00:34:21.840 --> 00:34:26.130
Compensation is a key
to making priority not

00:34:26.130 --> 00:34:28.020
hurt traffic so bad.

00:34:28.020 --> 00:34:29.670
And by compensation
what do I mean?

00:34:29.670 --> 00:34:33.239
What I mean is if I'm going to
give the bus street 15 seconds,

00:34:33.239 --> 00:34:36.420
I'm taking those 15
seconds away from somebody.

00:34:36.420 --> 00:34:39.510
Are you going to give it back?

00:34:39.510 --> 00:34:41.834
The language that
traffic engineers use

00:34:41.834 --> 00:34:43.060
is they use the word borrow.

00:34:43.060 --> 00:34:47.139
They say, oh, we'll just borrow
15 seconds from phase two.

00:34:47.139 --> 00:34:49.630
And then I ask are you
going to give it back?

00:34:49.630 --> 00:34:50.909
And they say, well, no.

00:34:50.909 --> 00:34:55.690
I say, well, then it's not
borrowing, that's stealing.

00:34:55.690 --> 00:34:59.560
So if you take away 15
seconds from phase two,

00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:07.480
and phase two now they
can't clear its queue.

00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:09.640
So now it's going to
have a long queue.

00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:12.550
And then the traffic
engineers will say, oh no,

00:35:12.550 --> 00:35:16.570
now if we let them have priority
in the next cycle as well,

00:35:16.570 --> 00:35:19.210
oh no, what a disaster.

00:35:19.210 --> 00:35:20.750
So that's why you
get these rules,

00:35:20.750 --> 00:35:23.620
like if we do priority, no
priority for the next cycle

00:35:23.620 --> 00:35:26.660
or the next five minutes.

00:35:26.660 --> 00:35:32.380
But if I hold the light green
for let's say East Street

00:35:32.380 --> 00:35:35.470
for the bus, so I hold
the light green 15 seconds

00:35:35.470 --> 00:35:39.110
for East Street, who's
going to get through

00:35:39.110 --> 00:35:40.510
in addition to the bus?

00:35:40.510 --> 00:35:42.370
A bunch of cars, right?

00:35:42.370 --> 00:35:45.880
A bunch of cars who otherwise
would have been in the queue

00:35:45.880 --> 00:35:47.524
for the next cycle.

00:35:47.524 --> 00:35:49.690
So that means when we come
around to the next cycle,

00:35:49.690 --> 00:35:51.400
East Street is not
going to need as much

00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:55.690
green because some of their
cars already got through.

00:35:55.690 --> 00:35:57.810
Meanwhile, other streets
whose green we took they

00:35:57.810 --> 00:35:58.800
need more green.

00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:03.810
So hey, why not just be
reasonable and fair about it.

00:36:03.810 --> 00:36:07.004
Since we gave East Street some
extra green, in the next cycle

00:36:07.004 --> 00:36:08.670
we'll give the other
streets extra green

00:36:08.670 --> 00:36:10.860
and we'll take some
away from East Street.

00:36:10.860 --> 00:36:12.690
That's compensation.

00:36:12.690 --> 00:36:14.820
That's a sensible
way of doing things.

00:36:14.820 --> 00:36:18.570
And what you'll see
is we don't do that.

00:36:18.570 --> 00:36:23.640
We can't do that with much of
the standard way of controlling

00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:26.730
lights that we follow
here in the US.

00:36:26.730 --> 00:36:29.490
And that's the
inflexibility that I'll

00:36:29.490 --> 00:36:33.170
be explaining later on.

00:36:33.170 --> 00:36:36.770
Then another weakness is
we'll do the easy things.

00:36:36.770 --> 00:36:38.030
Green extension is easy.

00:36:38.030 --> 00:36:40.100
So we just do green extension.

00:36:40.100 --> 00:36:42.920
And then, like I said, if
you have near side stops,

00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:44.570
well you don't get any benefit.

00:36:44.570 --> 00:36:46.790
And there are other tactics
that are harder to do,

00:36:46.790 --> 00:36:48.890
but we only do the easy ones.

00:36:48.890 --> 00:36:52.860
And then the last weakness
is failing to collect data.

00:36:52.860 --> 00:36:54.740
In something like this,
it's hard to get it

00:36:54.740 --> 00:36:55.650
right the first time.

00:36:55.650 --> 00:36:58.280
You need to do it, collect data.

00:36:58.280 --> 00:37:00.950
See, are my buses getting the
priority they're supposed to?

00:37:00.950 --> 00:37:03.860
If they're not, make some fixes.

00:37:03.860 --> 00:37:06.080
Is car traffic doing all right?

00:37:06.080 --> 00:37:09.140
Are there places where huge
queues are building up?

00:37:09.140 --> 00:37:10.970
And try to fix it.

00:37:10.970 --> 00:37:14.000
So take the objective seriously.

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:19.250
So now I need to move
away from transit priority

00:37:19.250 --> 00:37:21.500
and just tell you something
about traffic signal

00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:24.440
control in general
because it's something

00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:27.440
that isn't covered in a lot
of the standard transportation

00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:29.190
planning curriculum.

00:37:29.190 --> 00:37:33.350
So there are two basic
paradigms for signal control.

00:37:33.350 --> 00:37:37.250
One is fully actuated and
the other is coordinated.

00:37:37.250 --> 00:37:43.400
So fully actuated
that's uncoordinated.

00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:46.700
With fully actuated that
means every approach

00:37:46.700 --> 00:37:47.960
I've got detectors.

00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:50.480
And the standard
detector it's a loop

00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:52.400
of copper in the
street, a couple

00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:54.500
rounds that goes to a box.

00:37:54.500 --> 00:37:57.770
And through the miracles
of electromagnetism

00:37:57.770 --> 00:38:01.940
if a vehicle drives over
it, it induces a voltage.

00:38:01.940 --> 00:38:03.470
And you can pick
up that voltage,

00:38:03.470 --> 00:38:05.300
and so you know
there's a car there.

00:38:05.300 --> 00:38:05.800
Yeah.

00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:08.220
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:08.220 --> 00:38:10.440
PETER FURTH: So
there is a setting

00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:16.260
of how much of a voltage
change is enough because it

00:38:16.260 --> 00:38:17.240
has to become digital.

00:38:17.240 --> 00:38:19.750
It's either 0 or 1.

00:38:19.750 --> 00:38:22.050
So if we increase
the sensitivity,

00:38:22.050 --> 00:38:23.730
then it'll detect a bike.

00:38:23.730 --> 00:38:25.890
But then the danger
is it will also detect

00:38:25.890 --> 00:38:28.810
a car in the next lane over.

00:38:28.810 --> 00:38:30.460
So there is a trade off there.

00:38:30.460 --> 00:38:34.900
So then if we want
to detect bikes,

00:38:34.900 --> 00:38:37.570
we use a figure 8 configuration.

00:38:37.570 --> 00:38:42.010
And then we try to educate the
bicyclists, drive right down

00:38:42.010 --> 00:38:43.750
the middle of that figure 8.

00:38:43.750 --> 00:38:47.450
And that's where you'll
get picked up the most.

00:38:47.450 --> 00:38:49.175
Hardly anybody
knows that though.

00:38:52.900 --> 00:38:55.620
There's another solution
to bike detection, which

00:38:55.620 --> 00:39:02.860
is if you're a bicyclist
like me, I like green.

00:39:02.860 --> 00:39:04.250
I like red.

00:39:04.250 --> 00:39:05.020
I like yellow.

00:39:05.020 --> 00:39:06.400
I like all colors.

00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:06.960
I just go.

00:39:15.081 --> 00:39:15.580
All right.

00:39:15.580 --> 00:39:19.130
So with fully actuated
control I've got detectors.

00:39:19.130 --> 00:39:21.440
And based on those
detectors, I will

00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:24.560
know how many seconds
has it been since a car

00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:27.730
passed through and
[AUDIO OUT] gap.

00:39:27.730 --> 00:39:30.060
And once the gap reaches
a certain threshold,

00:39:30.060 --> 00:39:34.410
2 and 1/2 seconds, 3 seconds,
then you have gapped out.

00:39:34.410 --> 00:39:36.660
Boom, your turn is over.

00:39:36.660 --> 00:39:39.420
And it's the next one's turn.

00:39:39.420 --> 00:39:41.430
So there's no
fixed cycle length.

00:39:41.430 --> 00:39:42.000
Who knows?

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:45.270
If traffic volume is light, we
serve you, we serve the next,

00:39:45.270 --> 00:39:47.280
we serve the next,
and now we're back.

00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:48.330
Traffic is heavy.

00:39:48.330 --> 00:39:51.460
It might take 90
seconds to cycle around.

00:39:51.460 --> 00:39:54.600
But it's completely
flexible like that.

00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:59.640
And if I interrupt something
like that for transit

00:39:59.640 --> 00:40:03.790
priority and now
there's a longer queue--

00:40:03.790 --> 00:40:06.790
OK, everybody's been waiting
an extra 15 seconds because

00:40:06.790 --> 00:40:09.160
of this transit priority.

00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:13.570
Well, when their turn comes
up if they've got more cars,

00:40:13.570 --> 00:40:16.300
well the detector will say,
hey, they still have cars,

00:40:16.300 --> 00:40:17.590
still have cars, yeah.

00:40:17.590 --> 00:40:19.280
So keep them going,
keep them going.

00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:19.780
OK.

00:40:19.780 --> 00:40:22.850
Now we finally have a gap
you're over, onto the next one.

00:40:22.850 --> 00:40:26.110
And if East Street
like I was saying

00:40:26.110 --> 00:40:30.340
has less traffic, the street
that the bus was on because it

00:40:30.340 --> 00:40:34.890
got that green extension,
when its turn comes up instead

00:40:34.890 --> 00:40:37.680
of holding the
light for 35 seconds

00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:40.290
like it usually does it'll
hold the light for 25 seconds

00:40:40.290 --> 00:40:42.070
and then say, I'm all done.

00:40:42.070 --> 00:40:43.510
No more traffic.

00:40:43.510 --> 00:40:50.970
So fully actuated control is a
great background for priority

00:40:50.970 --> 00:40:55.710
because it's inherently
flexible, it's cycle free,

00:40:55.710 --> 00:40:59.660
it has that built
in compensation.

00:40:59.660 --> 00:41:03.980
But then there's another
way of doing control,

00:41:03.980 --> 00:41:06.380
another basic
paradigm for control,

00:41:06.380 --> 00:41:09.590
which is coordinated control.

00:41:09.590 --> 00:41:13.910
In the US, I'm
showing the most kind

00:41:13.910 --> 00:41:16.940
of the basic paradigm, which
is the dual ring with eight

00:41:16.940 --> 00:41:17.986
phases.

00:41:17.986 --> 00:41:20.360
I'm not including right turns
because right turns usually

00:41:20.360 --> 00:41:21.710
don't have their own lights.

00:41:21.710 --> 00:41:25.100
The right turns just go
with the through movements.

00:41:25.100 --> 00:41:27.320
And with coordinated
control like this

00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:34.460
we have EBL, that means
eastbound left, westbound

00:41:34.460 --> 00:41:37.370
through, WBT, westbound through.

00:41:37.370 --> 00:41:40.380
So the east-west
street has its time.

00:41:40.380 --> 00:41:42.740
There's an upper ring
and a lower ring.

00:41:42.740 --> 00:41:44.990
And the rings that
are in parallel they

00:41:44.990 --> 00:41:46.110
can move together.

00:41:46.110 --> 00:41:48.590
So when the light starts
green, eastbound left

00:41:48.590 --> 00:41:51.800
and westbound left, one and
five, they're green together.

00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:53.900
What comes next, two or six?

00:41:53.900 --> 00:41:55.220
That depends.

00:41:55.220 --> 00:41:57.980
Whichever one has more
traffic, one or five,

00:41:57.980 --> 00:42:02.510
that will stay green
because it has detectors

00:42:02.510 --> 00:42:04.280
while the other one gaps out.

00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:07.430
So maybe five gaps out first
because it had less traffic.

00:42:07.430 --> 00:42:10.220
Then six becomes
green along with one.

00:42:10.220 --> 00:42:14.090
Eventually one gaps out, and
now six is green along with two.

00:42:14.090 --> 00:42:16.620
But then six and two
have to end together.

00:42:16.620 --> 00:42:20.150
And then we have the same thing
for the north-south street.

00:42:20.150 --> 00:42:24.530
So this could be fully
actuated, but when

00:42:24.530 --> 00:42:26.240
I say it's coordinated
what I mean

00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:30.840
is phases two and six those
are the coordinated phases.

00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:35.310
And the cycle goes from
the end of two and six

00:42:35.310 --> 00:42:37.380
until the next end
of two and six.

00:42:37.380 --> 00:42:39.180
And that is a fixed
amount of time.

00:42:39.180 --> 00:42:41.550
So if it's 110
second cycle, it's

00:42:41.550 --> 00:42:44.790
always 110 seconds
from this point

00:42:44.790 --> 00:42:48.960
until when it
comes around again.

00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:51.132
These phases can
have some actuation.

00:42:51.132 --> 00:42:52.340
They can have some detectors.

00:42:52.340 --> 00:42:55.430
And so they might run
shorter than scheduled.

00:42:55.430 --> 00:42:58.160
And if they gap out
quicker, run short,

00:42:58.160 --> 00:43:01.640
and this one gaps out, it
runs short, this one gaps out,

00:43:01.640 --> 00:43:05.360
it runs short that means two and
six are going to start early.

00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:07.550
But if they start early,
they never end early.

00:43:07.550 --> 00:43:09.590
They run their full
length because that's

00:43:09.590 --> 00:43:12.140
how we have the full cycle.

00:43:12.140 --> 00:43:14.390
And the advantage
to do that is when

00:43:14.390 --> 00:43:18.410
you have many signals
in a line on an arterial

00:43:18.410 --> 00:43:20.870
and you want a green
wave, you have them

00:43:20.870 --> 00:43:22.370
all on the same cycle.

00:43:22.370 --> 00:43:24.870
And then you have their
different offsets.

00:43:24.870 --> 00:43:29.330
So let's say signal 1 it's
green starts at time 0.

00:43:29.330 --> 00:43:33.050
The next one that's maybe 20
seconds away, well it's green

00:43:33.050 --> 00:43:34.440
starts at time 20.

00:43:34.440 --> 00:43:36.590
And that way the cars
can get a green wave.

00:43:36.590 --> 00:43:37.760
That's the idea.

00:43:37.760 --> 00:43:38.260
Yeah.

00:43:38.260 --> 00:43:41.620
AUDIENCE: Are these doing that
while left turns [INAUDIBLE]??

00:43:41.620 --> 00:43:42.370
PETER FURTH: Yeah.

00:43:42.370 --> 00:43:44.930
As I drew it here, it's
protected left turns.

00:43:44.930 --> 00:43:46.650
You can have protected
plus permitted.

00:43:46.650 --> 00:43:48.624
I mean there are variations.

00:43:48.624 --> 00:43:51.290
If there might be no left turns,
then you can just take them out

00:43:51.290 --> 00:43:54.390
but that's the basic scheme.

00:43:54.390 --> 00:43:58.250
Now, what I want you to
think about is suppose

00:43:58.250 --> 00:44:03.580
the bus is on phase two
which is a common case.

00:44:03.580 --> 00:44:07.750
That's your Main Street the
street that's coordinated.

00:44:07.750 --> 00:44:10.500
And the bus says, I
need an extension.

00:44:10.500 --> 00:44:11.231
Extend the green.

00:44:11.231 --> 00:44:11.730
All right.

00:44:11.730 --> 00:44:16.680
We're going to borrow some
time from the later phases.

00:44:16.680 --> 00:44:19.692
So we're going to hold the
light green an extra 15 seconds.

00:44:22.650 --> 00:44:27.660
But remember we are
guaranteeing that at the end

00:44:27.660 --> 00:44:28.950
we've got to be on time again.

00:44:28.950 --> 00:44:34.730
So now we've only got 85 seconds
left to complete the cycle.

00:44:34.730 --> 00:44:37.790
And phase two and
six, they are not only

00:44:37.790 --> 00:44:39.350
guaranteed their
ending time, they're

00:44:39.350 --> 00:44:41.270
also guaranteed
they're starting time.

00:44:41.270 --> 00:44:45.282
So that means we have to take
those 15 seconds out of 3, 7,

00:44:45.282 --> 00:44:47.850
4, 8, and 1, 5.

00:44:47.850 --> 00:44:52.020
So to make things simple let's
only look at the bottom ring.

00:44:52.020 --> 00:44:56.400
So I have to take 15 seconds.

00:44:56.400 --> 00:44:58.770
The first generation, they
would take the whole 15

00:44:58.770 --> 00:45:01.080
seconds out of phase
seven and then phase seven

00:45:01.080 --> 00:45:01.950
would get canceled.

00:45:01.950 --> 00:45:03.220
Well that caused big problems.

00:45:03.220 --> 00:45:05.490
So now what they'll do
is they'll proportionally

00:45:05.490 --> 00:45:06.120
take it out.

00:45:06.120 --> 00:45:11.070
So let's say phase
seven is normally

00:45:11.070 --> 00:45:13.450
scheduled to have 20 seconds,
and this one is normally

00:45:13.450 --> 00:45:16.410
scheduled at 30 seconds,
and this one is normally

00:45:16.410 --> 00:45:18.130
scheduled to have 20 seconds.

00:45:18.130 --> 00:45:22.530
So 20, 30, 20,
that's sums up to 70.

00:45:22.530 --> 00:45:24.960
So I'm taking 15 seconds out.

00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:27.940
So a portion of that I'd take
from you, I'd take from you,

00:45:27.940 --> 00:45:29.370
I'd take from you.

00:45:29.370 --> 00:45:31.750
You get the idea.

00:45:31.750 --> 00:45:34.030
Is there any compensation
going on here?

00:45:34.030 --> 00:45:36.580
None at all.

00:45:36.580 --> 00:45:43.170
Phase six, the coordinated
phase, got an extra 15 seconds.

00:45:43.170 --> 00:45:47.920
But the competing phases,
they all got cut short.

00:45:47.920 --> 00:45:53.000
And now phase six comes
up for a full phase.

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:57.501
That's the way our coordinated
systems are programmed to work.

00:45:57.501 --> 00:45:59.250
They don't have to be
programmed that way,

00:45:59.250 --> 00:46:00.560
but that's the way they are.

00:46:00.560 --> 00:46:03.740
If you buy them from
any American supplier,

00:46:03.740 --> 00:46:07.450
that's how they're
programmed to work.

00:46:07.450 --> 00:46:10.570
So when you say let's
add transit priority

00:46:10.570 --> 00:46:12.430
on top of that, now
you can understand

00:46:12.430 --> 00:46:14.440
why the traffic engineers
say, I don't know

00:46:14.440 --> 00:46:16.900
about a 30 second extension.

00:46:16.900 --> 00:46:19.630
Or oh, after giving
priority in one cycle

00:46:19.630 --> 00:46:21.760
we better not give
priority in the next.

00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:24.880
Because it can really
screw up traffic.

00:46:24.880 --> 00:46:28.560
It lacks this mechanism
for compensation.

00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:30.120
And compensating would be easy.

00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:36.110
It would be say, let seven run
for its full scheduled time

00:46:36.110 --> 00:46:37.230
unless it gaps out.

00:46:37.230 --> 00:46:39.610
I mean if it gaps out if
there's no traffic, don't.

00:46:39.610 --> 00:46:43.140
And allow six to
start late because six

00:46:43.140 --> 00:46:44.220
got some extra time.

00:46:44.220 --> 00:46:47.940
It probably doesn't
need its full amount.

00:46:47.940 --> 00:46:49.754
But we don't do that.

00:46:52.580 --> 00:46:56.150
And then if we do
a longer extension,

00:46:56.150 --> 00:46:58.340
we get out of coordination,
we have to return back,

00:46:58.340 --> 00:46:59.570
and I won't go into that.

00:47:03.925 --> 00:47:05.800
I'll talk about a second
tactic, and then I'm

00:47:05.800 --> 00:47:10.240
going to take a break so you
can hear about how they've done

00:47:10.240 --> 00:47:12.130
priority in the Netherlands.

00:47:12.130 --> 00:47:16.210
A second tactic is
Early Green, OK?

00:47:16.210 --> 00:47:21.250
So in this diagram,
the phase that's green,

00:47:21.250 --> 00:47:24.540
that's the phase in which
the bus is coming, OK?

00:47:24.540 --> 00:47:26.250
And the phases that
precede it, those

00:47:26.250 --> 00:47:29.280
are competing phases, the
cross street or left turns

00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:31.380
that are waiting, OK?

00:47:31.380 --> 00:47:36.496
And the red dash line,
that's when in the cycle

00:47:36.496 --> 00:47:37.620
the bus is going to arrive.

00:47:37.620 --> 00:47:41.280
So I've got a
situation where the bus

00:47:41.280 --> 00:47:44.070
is expected to arrive near
the beginning of the left turn

00:47:44.070 --> 00:47:45.184
phase.

00:47:45.184 --> 00:47:47.100
And then it would have
to wait through the end

00:47:47.100 --> 00:47:48.480
of the left turn phase.

00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:52.140
And finally its
phase would be green.

00:47:52.140 --> 00:48:01.450
So with early green, I could
shorten the left turn phase.

00:48:01.450 --> 00:48:06.040
I could even shorten the
north-south phase before it.

00:48:06.040 --> 00:48:09.850
So that now it's a shorter wait
until the bus's green comes up.

00:48:09.850 --> 00:48:11.710
Maybe I even skip the left turn.

00:48:11.710 --> 00:48:14.530
I shorten the through,
phase skip the left turn

00:48:14.530 --> 00:48:19.990
and really make things
better for the bus that way.

00:48:19.990 --> 00:48:22.630
So an interesting way
to look at early green

00:48:22.630 --> 00:48:24.830
compared to green extension.

00:48:24.830 --> 00:48:29.410
It's a small benefit because
if I make the green start

00:48:29.410 --> 00:48:32.230
10 seconds early, that will
reduce the delay for the bus

00:48:32.230 --> 00:48:33.550
by 10 seconds.

00:48:36.120 --> 00:48:39.120
Remember with green
extension, 10 second extension

00:48:39.120 --> 00:48:41.430
could save a bus 90 seconds.

00:48:41.430 --> 00:48:46.950
But this-- it's a small
benefit, but who benefits?

00:48:46.950 --> 00:48:48.530
Any bus arriving on red.

00:48:48.530 --> 00:48:53.240
And red is usually a long time,
and a large percentage of buses

00:48:53.240 --> 00:48:54.230
arrive on red.

00:48:54.230 --> 00:48:58.070
Actually, the early part of
green, buses can also benefit.

00:48:58.070 --> 00:49:02.030
So it's a small benefit to
a large number of buses.

00:49:02.030 --> 00:49:02.530
Yeah.

00:49:02.530 --> 00:49:04.488
AUDIENCE: For skip you
have the question marks.

00:49:04.488 --> 00:49:07.280
Why wouldn't you just flip the
two cycles, flip the left--

00:49:07.280 --> 00:49:08.930
PETER FURTH: Well
that's a great idea.

00:49:08.930 --> 00:49:11.040
Flipping them,
but now then you'd

00:49:11.040 --> 00:49:13.070
have to give that
tactic a different name.

00:49:13.070 --> 00:49:16.900
And that name is
called phase rotation.

00:49:16.900 --> 00:49:17.830
So yeah.

00:49:17.830 --> 00:49:22.330
And some people think phase
rotation is an invitation

00:49:22.330 --> 00:49:23.990
to traffic Armageddon.

00:49:23.990 --> 00:49:25.090
It's going to be disaster.

00:49:25.090 --> 00:49:27.160
Cars are going to be
smashing into each other

00:49:27.160 --> 00:49:30.220
because people
expect their phase

00:49:30.220 --> 00:49:31.450
to come up at a certain time.

00:49:31.450 --> 00:49:33.580
And if it doesn't, they're going
to think the light is broken

00:49:33.580 --> 00:49:34.463
and go through.

00:49:37.850 --> 00:49:39.885
This is something
that can be tested.

00:49:39.885 --> 00:49:40.510
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:49:40.510 --> 00:49:41.840
I was just going to
ask whether or not--

00:49:41.840 --> 00:49:43.784
I think I've been at
a light before where

00:49:43.784 --> 00:49:46.350
I had a skipped left turn
and I was pretty pissed off.

00:49:46.350 --> 00:49:48.294
I was just curious
how that goes down.

00:49:48.294 --> 00:49:51.830
How many people does it--

00:49:51.830 --> 00:49:55.820
PETER FURTH: So in Zurich when
the traffic signal programmers

00:49:55.820 --> 00:49:59.490
said, we can give better
priority if we can do this.

00:49:59.490 --> 00:50:02.619
The higher ups were
worried about so they

00:50:02.619 --> 00:50:04.160
said, what we're
going to do is we're

00:50:04.160 --> 00:50:06.410
going to have a campaign
in which we're going to let

00:50:06.410 --> 00:50:09.140
the people in the city know
that for the next six months

00:50:09.140 --> 00:50:11.240
the sequence of
traffic signals is

00:50:11.240 --> 00:50:13.700
going to be completely random.

00:50:13.700 --> 00:50:17.830
Just wait until
your green comes up.

00:50:17.830 --> 00:50:19.480
And they did that.

00:50:19.480 --> 00:50:24.935
And then they went to
having a phase rotation.

00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:30.080
AUDIENCE: Isn't it the
law that you're supposed

00:50:30.080 --> 00:50:31.710
to wait until the green light?

00:50:31.710 --> 00:50:33.470
And they're assuming people--

00:50:33.470 --> 00:50:34.480
PETER FURTH: Yeah.

00:50:34.480 --> 00:50:37.920
So in my life-- and my life is
a little longer than yours, so

00:50:37.920 --> 00:50:42.360
in my lifetime of being
out on the streets

00:50:42.360 --> 00:50:47.090
and I do drive a car sometimes,
once I went through a red light

00:50:47.090 --> 00:50:50.360
because I waited
like two whole cycles

00:50:50.360 --> 00:50:51.800
and my phase never came up.

00:50:51.800 --> 00:50:53.300
So I figured the
detector was broken

00:50:53.300 --> 00:50:56.720
and there's no traffic around
here anyway, so I'm going.

00:50:56.720 --> 00:51:00.616
So people will do
that now and then.

00:51:00.616 --> 00:51:04.010
It doesn't happen often though.

00:51:04.010 --> 00:51:05.810
But what you say about
won't people wait,

00:51:05.810 --> 00:51:08.780
there is one class of
people who won't wait.

00:51:08.780 --> 00:51:10.310
And that's called bicyclists.

00:51:10.310 --> 00:51:13.160
So you got to
watch out for them.

00:51:13.160 --> 00:51:14.260
Think about their safety.

00:51:16.850 --> 00:51:22.590
Now, in practice, often
you can't get much benefit

00:51:22.590 --> 00:51:26.530
from early green
because who's green

00:51:26.530 --> 00:51:28.494
are you trying to cut short?

00:51:28.494 --> 00:51:29.910
If what you're
trying to cut short

00:51:29.910 --> 00:51:32.220
is the cross streets green,
the cross streets green

00:51:32.220 --> 00:51:36.060
is often determined
by pedestrians.

00:51:36.060 --> 00:51:38.040
And we don't cut
pedestrian phases.

00:51:38.040 --> 00:51:42.100
Pedestrians and transit you
know we're on the same team.

00:51:42.100 --> 00:51:45.480
We don't want to hurt one to
help the other because all

00:51:45.480 --> 00:51:48.510
of our transit passengers become
pedestrians as soon as they

00:51:48.510 --> 00:51:50.130
get off the bus.

00:51:50.130 --> 00:51:55.230
So a lot of times you just can't
do early green because you've

00:51:55.230 --> 00:51:59.400
got a wide street, the cars
need about 15 seconds of green

00:51:59.400 --> 00:52:01.830
to get through, but the
pedestrians need 24 seconds.

00:52:01.830 --> 00:52:04.170
So the green light's
24 seconds, it's

00:52:04.170 --> 00:52:06.180
entirely because it's
what the pedestrians need.

00:52:06.180 --> 00:52:09.150
You can't cut that short.

00:52:09.150 --> 00:52:14.100
So that's a practical issue
that early green there

00:52:14.100 --> 00:52:18.420
are limitations unless you
can detect the bus really

00:52:18.420 --> 00:52:22.320
far in advance and cut
something else short.

00:52:22.320 --> 00:52:36.360
So let me take a break now
and introduce Jan Nederveen.

00:52:36.360 --> 00:52:42.330
Jan is a senior transportation
planner with the city of Delft.

00:52:42.330 --> 00:52:48.070
And I get the privilege every
summer for the last 10 years,

00:52:48.070 --> 00:52:51.240
I've been taking 20 or
25 Northeastern students

00:52:51.240 --> 00:52:54.690
to Delft for five weeks
for a course in sustainable

00:52:54.690 --> 00:52:56.100
transportation.

00:52:56.100 --> 00:52:59.720
And there they get to enjoy
incredible bike paths,

00:52:59.720 --> 00:53:05.040
incredible roundabouts,
streets rebuilt

00:53:05.040 --> 00:53:08.310
to be safe for
public transportation

00:53:08.310 --> 00:53:11.220
systems, new train
station, fantastic stuff.

00:53:11.220 --> 00:53:13.530
And it turns out the guy who
plans a lot of this stuff

00:53:13.530 --> 00:53:14.910
is sitting right here.

00:53:14.910 --> 00:53:16.620
And he often speaks
to our students

00:53:16.620 --> 00:53:18.790
and explains it and the
philosophy behind it.

00:53:18.790 --> 00:53:23.100
So Jan, would you come and
say something about how do you

00:53:23.100 --> 00:53:27.250
do transit priority in Delft.

00:53:27.250 --> 00:53:28.000
JAN NEDERVEEN: OK.

00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:28.499
Welcome.

00:53:28.499 --> 00:53:31.010
Thank you for having me here.

00:53:31.010 --> 00:53:34.270
I'm going to tell you something
that works that I don't do

00:53:34.270 --> 00:53:35.710
but my colleagues do.

00:53:35.710 --> 00:53:39.670
I've got three people in
my department doing traffic

00:53:39.670 --> 00:53:41.200
engineering, traffic lights.

00:53:41.200 --> 00:53:44.440
They design it, they build
it, and they maintain it.

00:53:44.440 --> 00:53:47.500
So what I'll show you here
is part of the thoughts

00:53:47.500 --> 00:53:51.400
they have done and I only
focus on public transport.

00:53:51.400 --> 00:53:54.730
Peter offers many times
a lot about cycling

00:53:54.730 --> 00:53:59.060
but this time it will
be public transport.

00:53:59.060 --> 00:54:02.040
First I'll give you some
views about the network.

00:54:02.040 --> 00:54:04.580
And then I'll show you the
two current types of priority

00:54:04.580 --> 00:54:05.100
we give.

00:54:05.100 --> 00:54:08.510
We do physical priority,
and we do time priority.

00:54:08.510 --> 00:54:12.760
I'll show you some slides
for some examples of Delft.

00:54:12.760 --> 00:54:19.710
First our city Delft,
100,000 residents close to

00:54:19.710 --> 00:54:23.190
of The Hague with
600,000 residents.

00:54:23.190 --> 00:54:25.470
That's how we oriented
in the busiest part,

00:54:25.470 --> 00:54:28.120
dense part of the Netherlands.

00:54:28.120 --> 00:54:32.950
First we had one system
to try to serve everybody.

00:54:32.950 --> 00:54:36.310
And we didn't succeed in it
because our public transport

00:54:36.310 --> 00:54:39.010
system was too slow.

00:54:39.010 --> 00:54:41.080
And then we figured
out, oh, that's good.

00:54:41.080 --> 00:54:44.500
We have two kinds of groups
we like to facilitate.

00:54:44.500 --> 00:54:48.130
One group are the commuters
going to their work.

00:54:48.130 --> 00:54:51.680
And what they love is
speed as soon as possible

00:54:51.680 --> 00:54:53.380
going to destination.

00:54:53.380 --> 00:54:57.080
In their view they only need one
stop between their front door

00:54:57.080 --> 00:54:58.500
and at their destination.

00:54:58.500 --> 00:55:02.280
And everything between
is not needed for them.

00:55:02.280 --> 00:55:05.850
Well, I need to collect
so much more passengers

00:55:05.850 --> 00:55:08.340
that we say, we
make straight lines,

00:55:08.340 --> 00:55:12.750
few stops, serving high
dense volume housing

00:55:12.750 --> 00:55:15.920
with high dense jobs together.

00:55:15.920 --> 00:55:18.390
And then you can go for the
high speed, the high quality,

00:55:18.390 --> 00:55:22.050
and we see that we
attract more passengers.

00:55:22.050 --> 00:55:25.410
The second group is everybody
else-- usually elderly people,

00:55:25.410 --> 00:55:27.420
people without a job.

00:55:27.420 --> 00:55:31.200
And we focus on them, as
you say, they need coverage.

00:55:31.200 --> 00:55:34.120
They have to go to
many local locations.

00:55:34.120 --> 00:55:37.670
So we make a citywide
network covering every area.

00:55:37.670 --> 00:55:40.620
And that is located
on a lower speed

00:55:40.620 --> 00:55:44.400
because I have to cover
everything low frequency.

00:55:44.400 --> 00:55:47.200
That's the way we
handle public transport.

00:55:47.200 --> 00:55:49.110
The first group is
growing, the second group

00:55:49.110 --> 00:55:51.840
is stable If you
look at the data.

00:55:54.700 --> 00:55:57.230
This is how our network works.

00:55:57.230 --> 00:55:59.440
I've got a purple line.

00:55:59.440 --> 00:56:02.800
That's the Delft railway system
connecting all major cities

00:56:02.800 --> 00:56:03.610
of the Netherlands.

00:56:03.610 --> 00:56:05.860
If you get in Delft
central station,

00:56:05.860 --> 00:56:08.590
within an hour you're
standing on the central market

00:56:08.590 --> 00:56:11.800
in Amsterdam, within 10
minutes to 50 minutes

00:56:11.800 --> 00:56:13.510
you're in Rotterdam
or The Hague.

00:56:13.510 --> 00:56:18.377
Nationwide system very good
quality, 11 trains each hour

00:56:18.377 --> 00:56:19.800
each direction.

00:56:19.800 --> 00:56:22.090
So it's perfect.

00:56:22.090 --> 00:56:24.940
If you live in Delft, you
can reach 1 million jobs

00:56:24.940 --> 00:56:26.900
within 45 minutes.

00:56:26.900 --> 00:56:32.340
So if you need a
place, live in Delft.

00:56:32.340 --> 00:56:33.610
That's our first system.

00:56:33.610 --> 00:56:37.080
The second one, if I asked
the people what do they like,

00:56:37.080 --> 00:56:39.990
most people like
light rail like tram.

00:56:39.990 --> 00:56:44.130
There's a large group of car
drivers who love light rail

00:56:44.130 --> 00:56:45.300
and don't like buses.

00:56:45.300 --> 00:56:49.340
So I tried to convert my
complete network to light rail.

00:56:49.340 --> 00:56:51.590
That is the dotted
lines over here.

00:56:51.590 --> 00:56:54.660
The red ones are already
built. And we're still

00:56:54.660 --> 00:56:56.290
talking with the
regional government

00:56:56.290 --> 00:56:58.830
to get funding
for the black one.

00:56:58.830 --> 00:57:01.350
And if that's done,
you see a spider kind

00:57:01.350 --> 00:57:04.810
of network covering
most of the city.

00:57:04.810 --> 00:57:08.590
And I add some regional bus
lines through its radial lines.

00:57:08.590 --> 00:57:10.992
That's the next
coverage of our system.

00:57:10.992 --> 00:57:12.325
And that's the commuter network.

00:57:16.580 --> 00:57:19.700
And that's the last network
covering everything.

00:57:19.700 --> 00:57:22.380
Step on a bus, pay $2,
you've got the whole city

00:57:22.380 --> 00:57:24.980
to view if you've got the time.

00:57:24.980 --> 00:57:28.110
That's how we cover
the complete area.

00:57:28.110 --> 00:57:32.130
And the last group is
transport on demand.

00:57:32.130 --> 00:57:36.720
If you're unable to use a public
bus, we use smaller buses.

00:57:36.720 --> 00:57:38.945
You have to phone
every one hour, search

00:57:38.945 --> 00:57:42.780
a bus driving through, and you
were picked up and delivered

00:57:42.780 --> 00:57:45.030
door to door transport.

00:57:45.030 --> 00:57:49.100
It's a fantastic system
but it's awful expensive.

00:57:49.100 --> 00:57:52.680
So what we're trying to do is
get people out of this system,

00:57:52.680 --> 00:57:55.710
this market is growing,
and getting them back

00:57:55.710 --> 00:57:56.640
in a normal bus.

00:57:56.640 --> 00:57:59.640
So we modify the bus so they
are more attractive for people

00:57:59.640 --> 00:58:02.610
with light handicaps.

00:58:02.610 --> 00:58:04.650
And the other thing we
are thinking about, maybe

00:58:04.650 --> 00:58:07.860
we can offer a discount to the
buses as a sort of timetable.

00:58:07.860 --> 00:58:11.320
We have a line structure for
driving that kind of business.

00:58:11.320 --> 00:58:13.230
So it looks like more
public transport which

00:58:13.230 --> 00:58:18.230
makes it more cheaper to run.

00:58:18.230 --> 00:58:20.590
Physical priority.

00:58:20.590 --> 00:58:22.600
That's the first thing we do.

00:58:22.600 --> 00:58:26.340
If a bus is in the same lane
as a car or if there's many

00:58:26.340 --> 00:58:28.630
bicycles usually
there's the same speed,

00:58:28.630 --> 00:58:31.265
and I cannot give
them any priority,

00:58:31.265 --> 00:58:33.640
let's give them bus lines.

00:58:36.490 --> 00:58:39.060
Where the center of city,
center is city Delft, that

00:58:39.060 --> 00:58:41.380
is the downtown area, the
central market square,

00:58:41.380 --> 00:58:43.870
this is where all the shops
are and all the restaurants.

00:58:43.870 --> 00:58:45.490
That's the most
historical center.

00:58:45.490 --> 00:58:47.455
It's a lovely place to be.

00:58:47.455 --> 00:58:51.370
You see the square over there,
that is the central railroad

00:58:51.370 --> 00:58:52.270
station.

00:58:52.270 --> 00:58:55.020
If you'd like to leave
the city, go there.

00:58:55.020 --> 00:58:56.620
And we designed
all the bus lines

00:58:56.620 --> 00:58:59.440
going to the central
railroad station.

00:58:59.440 --> 00:59:02.130
We can give them good
priority on that location.

00:59:04.790 --> 00:59:06.920
When do we need a bus lane?

00:59:06.920 --> 00:59:13.230
We need it if there is a delay
of driving with the cars.

00:59:13.230 --> 00:59:15.790
So on busy streets I
like to have a bus lane.

00:59:15.790 --> 00:59:19.640
And that's difficult because
if it's a busy street,

00:59:19.640 --> 00:59:23.290
you need probably four lanes
or two lanes of car traffic.

00:59:23.290 --> 00:59:26.470
And I'm asking one lane
for six or eight buses

00:59:26.470 --> 00:59:28.340
per hour in each direction.

00:59:28.340 --> 00:59:31.280
So then we have to compete, as
I said, in the busiest areas.

00:59:31.280 --> 00:59:34.900
We start searching for a bus
lane or a light rail lane

00:59:34.900 --> 00:59:37.180
so we can give them priority.

00:59:37.180 --> 00:59:40.210
And elsewhere-- this
is a residential area,

00:59:40.210 --> 00:59:44.880
it's nice to have but you
don't need to have it.

00:59:44.880 --> 00:59:47.300
This was thought in
the 80s, OK, let's

00:59:47.300 --> 00:59:49.880
make a bus lane everywhere
so we get the bus

00:59:49.880 --> 00:59:51.830
lane in a residential area.

00:59:51.830 --> 00:59:54.500
And the only place
we need it that it's

00:59:54.500 --> 00:59:57.280
crossing the highway
in that location

00:59:57.280 --> 00:59:59.976
is because that's our
big intersections.

01:00:03.190 --> 01:00:09.960
Another part of priority is at
the central station of Delft.

01:00:09.960 --> 01:00:11.895
This area, if you
look at Delft and you

01:00:11.895 --> 01:00:14.210
take in Delft area,
urban development,

01:00:14.210 --> 01:00:17.260
railroad you see a huge
development in the downtown

01:00:17.260 --> 01:00:17.760
area.

01:00:17.760 --> 01:00:20.790
Over here is the old station.

01:00:20.790 --> 01:00:22.110
Over there is a new one.

01:00:22.110 --> 01:00:26.380
We have spent 500 million Euros
to get the railroad tracks

01:00:26.380 --> 01:00:29.970
under the ground
for 1 and 1/2 miles.

01:00:29.970 --> 01:00:34.380
And we built a complete railroad
station, a new bus platform,

01:00:34.380 --> 01:00:38.460
and we did a complete separation
of all the transfer flows.

01:00:38.460 --> 01:00:41.695
On the surface level we
offered public transport.

01:00:41.695 --> 01:00:44.670
So in the open air,
that's public transport.

01:00:44.670 --> 01:00:47.130
On minus one, in
the basement, we

01:00:47.130 --> 01:00:50.850
have the huge parking
facility with parking lanes

01:00:50.850 --> 01:00:53.020
underground to bus platform.

01:00:53.020 --> 01:00:56.580
So we have a physical
separation of the bike transport

01:00:56.580 --> 01:00:59.505
going to the railroad station
and the bus transport.

01:00:59.505 --> 01:01:03.270
Now on level minus two, we
have the railroad tracks.

01:01:03.270 --> 01:01:06.510
That's one way of separation.

01:01:06.510 --> 01:01:10.690
You can see it here
in the picture.

01:01:10.690 --> 01:01:12.640
This is the town hall,
the glass building.

01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:14.494
And the first floor,
the ground floor,

01:01:14.494 --> 01:01:15.660
that's the railroad station.

01:01:15.660 --> 01:01:18.100
We have the name Delft on it.

01:01:18.100 --> 01:01:19.960
And underneath in
it right, you can

01:01:19.960 --> 01:01:24.340
see people standing at the
entrance of the parking garage.

01:01:24.340 --> 01:01:27.760
We've got 100,000
people living in Delft.

01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:31.480
This parking garage for
bicycles is today 8,000 places,

01:01:31.480 --> 01:01:33.520
and it's not enough.

01:01:33.520 --> 01:01:36.260
So a few years later there
will be 10,000 places

01:01:36.260 --> 01:01:39.270
for 100,000 residents.

01:01:39.270 --> 01:01:41.337
So bike parking
is very important.

01:01:41.337 --> 01:01:43.170
AUDIENCE: There's also
the university there,

01:01:43.170 --> 01:01:47.181
so they're not all residents.

01:01:47.181 --> 01:01:47.680
Yeah.

01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:49.817
Not all the students are
residents [INAUDIBLE]..

01:01:49.817 --> 01:01:50.650
JAN NEDERVEEN: Yeah.

01:01:50.650 --> 01:01:51.490
It's students.

01:01:51.490 --> 01:01:52.531
It's also residents now.

01:01:52.531 --> 01:01:53.030
Yes.

01:01:53.030 --> 01:01:54.670
OK.

01:01:54.670 --> 01:02:00.230
But when the students
are at the university

01:02:00.230 --> 01:02:04.360
and you look at the parking
facility, it's also full.

01:02:04.360 --> 01:02:06.400
And other people leaving Delft.

01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:09.250
Some of them are
also students going

01:02:09.250 --> 01:02:12.250
into a university in
Leiden or in Rotterdam

01:02:12.250 --> 01:02:16.480
but also normal people like
myself are parking there.

01:02:16.480 --> 01:02:19.540
It's not a student
parking garage.

01:02:19.540 --> 01:02:21.070
Yeah.

01:02:21.070 --> 01:02:24.780
It's true that a large
group of them are students.

01:02:24.780 --> 01:02:27.570
Well minus one is for the
bikes and the bus platform

01:02:27.570 --> 01:02:29.940
is operational on this level.

01:02:29.940 --> 01:02:34.900
So buses don't have to deal
with cars or with pedestrians

01:02:34.900 --> 01:02:36.300
or with bikes.

01:02:36.300 --> 01:02:37.094
Yes.

01:02:37.094 --> 01:02:39.070
AUDIENCE: So if minus
one is parking for bikes,

01:02:39.070 --> 01:02:44.510
do they also travel on that
level or do they [INAUDIBLE]??

01:02:44.510 --> 01:02:47.280
JAN NEDERVEEN: The bikes
also travel on minus one.

01:02:47.280 --> 01:02:51.180
The bike lane goes
here under this bridge

01:02:51.180 --> 01:02:52.570
and then entering the park.

01:02:52.570 --> 01:02:54.750
You can see there's
a rim over it.

01:02:54.750 --> 01:02:57.390
So he has a complete
separation to minus one

01:02:57.390 --> 01:03:01.640
in the most busiest area.

01:03:01.640 --> 01:03:04.630
And that saves me a lot of
time because the first traffic

01:03:04.630 --> 01:03:07.620
light, very close to
the railroad station,

01:03:07.620 --> 01:03:12.700
should otherwise have to deal
with 10,000 bicycles a day.

01:03:12.700 --> 01:03:14.350
But I've offered
them a tunnel so I've

01:03:14.350 --> 01:03:17.050
got a normal intersection
with a normal traffic light.

01:03:17.050 --> 01:03:20.880
All the rest I cannot handle
that amount of cyclists,

01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:24.100
and this Peter here among
this group, he will not stop.

01:03:27.970 --> 01:03:29.870
Here's an aerial
view of the system.

01:03:29.870 --> 01:03:31.630
The town hall is in the front.

01:03:31.630 --> 01:03:33.860
And we have also an
east-west separation.

01:03:33.860 --> 01:03:38.190
On the down inner city
side that's over here,

01:03:38.190 --> 01:03:42.560
we put the bus lane,
the light rail lane.

01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:46.810
And on the other side, we've got
the lane with the car traffic.

01:03:46.810 --> 01:03:48.870
And that's very important
because at the top

01:03:48.870 --> 01:03:51.420
of the picture on
the left side, I

01:03:51.420 --> 01:03:54.120
have an intersection where all
public transport has to make

01:03:54.120 --> 01:03:56.436
all the left or right turns.

01:03:56.436 --> 01:03:57.810
And that's the
only one that make

01:03:57.810 --> 01:04:00.320
that turn because the
car route is blocked

01:04:00.320 --> 01:04:02.820
and the bike lane is
underground in a tunnel.

01:04:02.820 --> 01:04:06.330
So I have an intersection
where only public transport

01:04:06.330 --> 01:04:08.539
makes left and right turns.

01:04:08.539 --> 01:04:10.830
And on the other intersection
that's almost falling off

01:04:10.830 --> 01:04:12.288
the picture on the
right side, that

01:04:12.288 --> 01:04:17.040
is my car intersection where
all the light rail traffic only

01:04:17.040 --> 01:04:19.520
has to cross, they
go straight through.

01:04:19.520 --> 01:04:23.430
So it was much easier to handle
if a separate public transport

01:04:23.430 --> 01:04:26.950
and car transport on
different intersections.

01:04:26.950 --> 01:04:31.000
And my transport engineers were
interested in traffic lights.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.550
I took them, let me have a
look if this is the same.

01:04:33.550 --> 01:04:37.900
Can you build a traffic
light for this location?

01:04:37.900 --> 01:04:41.680
Because the alternative was one
big crossing with everything,

01:04:41.680 --> 01:04:44.900
and that didn't work.

01:04:44.900 --> 01:04:48.830
I do also have some discussions
with my urban planners.

01:04:48.830 --> 01:04:52.610
And they love the light rail and
the green grass in the middle.

01:04:55.480 --> 01:05:01.230
And my public
transport here, lots

01:05:01.230 --> 01:05:07.090
of asphalt. What do you like?

01:05:07.090 --> 01:05:08.980
I pick you out.

01:05:08.980 --> 01:05:12.000
Which one would
you like and why?

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:15.920
AUDIENCE: I'd prefer the
light lines because I feel

01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:18.370
like you're more in tune with--

01:05:18.370 --> 01:05:22.520
you experience the
road better that way.

01:05:22.520 --> 01:05:24.120
You can serve the
demand like that.

01:05:24.120 --> 01:05:25.324
You should go green.

01:05:25.324 --> 01:05:26.740
JAN NEDERVEEN: So
which one do you

01:05:26.740 --> 01:05:28.865
like, the light rail in
the green or the light rail

01:05:28.865 --> 01:05:30.182
in the asphalt?

01:05:30.182 --> 01:05:32.184
AUDIENCE: In the green.

01:05:32.184 --> 01:05:33.350
JAN NEDERVEEN: In the green.

01:05:33.350 --> 01:05:36.035
It's lovely, nicer.

01:05:36.035 --> 01:05:36.910
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:05:36.910 --> 01:05:37.743
JAN NEDERVEEN: Yeah.

01:05:37.743 --> 01:05:40.100
Well we had that
discussion also.

01:05:40.100 --> 01:05:43.270
I also think the top picture
is the most beautiful.

01:05:43.270 --> 01:05:46.940
But this has one
big disadvantage.

01:05:46.940 --> 01:05:51.030
If I have a bus link or
a public transport link

01:05:51.030 --> 01:05:55.220
but I like to operate buses
as well as light rail,

01:05:55.220 --> 01:05:59.720
in this situation they can
both use the same line.

01:05:59.720 --> 01:06:01.550
And I've got one
platform, and you

01:06:01.550 --> 01:06:04.720
can decide if you take
a bus or light rail.

01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:08.780
And the one on top, if I would
like to add the bus lane,

01:06:08.780 --> 01:06:12.260
well that would be a bus
stop without priority

01:06:12.260 --> 01:06:14.300
on the normal street.

01:06:14.300 --> 01:06:15.740
I [INAUDIBLE] that
one because it

01:06:15.740 --> 01:06:18.560
doesn't have a bus lane
anymore because I replaced it

01:06:18.560 --> 01:06:19.240
by a light rail.

01:06:22.120 --> 01:06:22.760
Yes.

01:06:22.760 --> 01:06:25.970
AUDIENCE: What is the typical
frequency of light rail lines?

01:06:25.970 --> 01:06:28.810
JAN NEDERVEEN: The minimum
is four light rail vehicles

01:06:28.810 --> 01:06:29.950
an hour each direction.

01:06:29.950 --> 01:06:31.670
That's the minimum.

01:06:31.670 --> 01:06:32.170
Otherwise--

01:06:32.170 --> 01:06:33.540
AUDIENCE: Rush hour?

01:06:33.540 --> 01:06:37.080
JAN NEDERVEEN: It goes
up to 6 or 8 in Delft.

01:06:37.080 --> 01:06:39.920
And in other cities
it can be more.

01:06:39.920 --> 01:06:44.770
But eight is all pretty much
for city with 100,000 people.

01:06:44.770 --> 01:06:47.470
And it has to
compete with cycling.

01:06:47.470 --> 01:06:50.710
So many people who
cycle you take them out

01:06:50.710 --> 01:06:54.180
from the public
transport system.

01:06:54.180 --> 01:06:58.490
These guys, cab
drivers always ask me,

01:06:58.490 --> 01:07:01.250
may I use your bus lanes?

01:07:01.250 --> 01:07:05.030
Because they are so fast and
they have beautiful traffic

01:07:05.030 --> 01:07:06.230
lights.

01:07:06.230 --> 01:07:09.700
I couldn't find a letter
size bigger than this one.

01:07:12.740 --> 01:07:14.240
I said no!

01:07:14.240 --> 01:07:16.720
Absolutely not!

01:07:16.720 --> 01:07:22.740
I've got maybe 2018 cabs
in Delft, but it's no, no.

01:07:22.740 --> 01:07:25.627
AUDIENCE: It's not more
efficient than driving.

01:07:25.627 --> 01:07:27.460
JAN NEDERVEEN: Oh, they
love to drive my bus

01:07:27.460 --> 01:07:30.160
lanes like the fire
department, who is pretty fast,

01:07:30.160 --> 01:07:34.360
but no way I want it.

01:07:34.360 --> 01:07:38.530
Because if they enter
a huge intersection

01:07:38.530 --> 01:07:41.260
and there is a bus going
at that intersection,

01:07:41.260 --> 01:07:44.620
I know that bus will
make a left turn.

01:07:44.620 --> 01:07:47.680
Because every bus on that
intersection will make a left

01:07:47.680 --> 01:07:48.620
turn.

01:07:48.620 --> 01:07:52.970
And that means all other
directions can get green.

01:07:52.970 --> 01:07:55.736
I don't know where
that cab is going.

01:07:55.736 --> 01:07:59.810
So you have to completely block
the intersection for one cab.

01:07:59.810 --> 01:08:00.560
Yes?

01:08:00.560 --> 01:08:04.851
AUDIENCE: Why is that London
lets taxis use the bus lanes?

01:08:04.851 --> 01:08:06.830
Are you familiar with that?

01:08:06.830 --> 01:08:08.020
JAN NEDERVEEN: In London?

01:08:08.020 --> 01:08:08.644
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:08:08.644 --> 01:08:11.150
JAN NEDERVEEN: Yeah,
maybe they block out

01:08:11.150 --> 01:08:15.270
all the other directions
to give them the priority.

01:08:15.270 --> 01:08:19.229
And that will seriously harm
all other modes of transport.

01:08:19.229 --> 01:08:23.290
It would harm car
traffic and bike traffic.

01:08:23.290 --> 01:08:27.560
And we like to give priority
to the buses with many people,

01:08:27.560 --> 01:08:29.290
but this is one
taxi who have maybe

01:08:29.290 --> 01:08:30.990
one or two people inside it.

01:08:30.990 --> 01:08:34.015
That's not worth the effort.

01:08:34.015 --> 01:08:36.090
And it's a big risk
to give him green

01:08:36.090 --> 01:08:37.454
and see what is happening.

01:08:41.170 --> 01:08:41.950
Time priority.

01:08:41.950 --> 01:08:46.340
Peter already taught some
things but that is what we do.

01:08:46.340 --> 01:08:49.689
You have special traffic
lights, the [INAUDIBLE] traffic

01:08:49.689 --> 01:08:56.580
lights that's in the picture on
the black/white border column.

01:08:56.580 --> 01:08:59.890
That's showing if you get green
to left or to right or straight

01:08:59.890 --> 01:09:01.340
through for our bus.

01:09:01.340 --> 01:09:04.990
And we have two
kinds of detection.

01:09:04.990 --> 01:09:07.270
The first one is
the intelligent one.

01:09:07.270 --> 01:09:13.189
So every vehicle says,
I'm bus 24 vehicle number,

01:09:13.189 --> 01:09:18.520
so I should be here
20 minutes past five.

01:09:18.520 --> 01:09:21.439
So it's also telling
it's time per table.

01:09:21.439 --> 01:09:25.300
And then we know, OK,
you're one minute early,

01:09:25.300 --> 01:09:29.979
we will not give you priority
That's the expensive one.

01:09:29.979 --> 01:09:32.720
And the other one, that's
a simple detection.

01:09:32.720 --> 01:09:35.080
Some vehicle is crossing
a detector and notice, oh,

01:09:35.080 --> 01:09:36.490
this is a vehicle.

01:09:36.490 --> 01:09:37.960
I even don't know
which bus it is.

01:09:37.960 --> 01:09:40.450
Even if you are a
car you are detected

01:09:40.450 --> 01:09:42.640
and then you get some priority.

01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:44.200
That's the way of detection.

01:09:44.200 --> 01:09:45.399
The top one is the best.

01:09:45.399 --> 01:09:48.460
So if we are in charge and
it's our traffic light,

01:09:48.460 --> 01:09:50.439
we put in the intelligent one.

01:09:50.439 --> 01:09:52.390
If somebody is else
doing the design,

01:09:52.390 --> 01:09:55.610
a regional government,
sometimes you get the cheap one.

01:09:55.610 --> 01:09:58.960
Especially in the Delft
University, top technology

01:09:58.960 --> 01:10:01.480
campus, the cheap
one is installed.

01:10:04.630 --> 01:10:05.840
Traffic light priority.

01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:10.120
Peter showed you a bus stop
close to an intersection.

01:10:10.120 --> 01:10:14.360
Well, here's an example of
a traffic light priority

01:10:14.360 --> 01:10:16.070
at a huge intersection.

01:10:16.070 --> 01:10:19.170
The term has to make
a turn to the left.

01:10:19.170 --> 01:10:23.550
And what we do, we
put in to two lines.

01:10:23.550 --> 01:10:26.220
The first one is
the location where

01:10:26.220 --> 01:10:29.940
the light rail, the [AUDIO OUT]
for handling the passengers.

01:10:29.940 --> 01:10:33.770
I don't know how
long that will take.

01:10:33.770 --> 01:10:36.540
And I don't want to stop all
the other traffic because he

01:10:36.540 --> 01:10:37.850
is still handling passengers.

01:10:37.850 --> 01:10:40.400
If I do so, I get many
letters from people

01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:41.970
waiting for nothing.

01:10:41.970 --> 01:10:44.270
So there's a second
stop line, go

01:10:44.270 --> 01:10:46.850
straightforward on
the intersection.

01:10:46.850 --> 01:10:49.530
And then the light
rail will [INAUDIBLE],,

01:10:49.530 --> 01:10:51.350
hey, hello I'm here.

01:10:51.350 --> 01:10:54.220
Please can you give
me what priority.

01:10:54.220 --> 01:10:57.560
And what this system does,
he will not break off

01:10:57.560 --> 01:10:58.610
all the other signals.

01:10:58.610 --> 01:11:00.900
He says, oh, I've
finished my phase,

01:11:00.900 --> 01:11:04.370
I then add in the phase
with public transport,

01:11:04.370 --> 01:11:06.530
and then I continue
with all the rest.

01:11:06.530 --> 01:11:09.260
I don't take out any
time from the others,

01:11:09.260 --> 01:11:13.410
just merge in a priority
for the traffic lights.

01:11:13.410 --> 01:11:15.395
So this intersection
is four phases

01:11:15.395 --> 01:11:18.300
so there are four chances
to give him priority.

01:11:18.300 --> 01:11:21.710
So the waiting time is
not a full cycle but only

01:11:21.710 --> 01:11:24.360
a quarter of it.

01:11:24.360 --> 01:11:26.860
That's how it works.

01:11:26.860 --> 01:11:31.510
This is that same
intersection from the air.

01:11:31.510 --> 01:11:33.640
So it's a huge one, the
biggest intersection

01:11:33.640 --> 01:11:35.543
we have in the built up area.

01:11:35.543 --> 01:11:38.440
We have total detection
all directions.

01:11:38.440 --> 01:11:41.950
Also the bicycles are detected.

01:11:41.950 --> 01:11:43.000
We have a detector.

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:44.020
We don't use an eight.

01:11:44.020 --> 01:11:46.010
We've got a good detector.

01:11:46.010 --> 01:11:48.190
So we detect bikes.

01:11:48.190 --> 01:11:51.070
There also is a button if you
like, but most of the time

01:11:51.070 --> 01:11:53.290
you're already detected.

01:11:53.290 --> 01:11:59.010
We have a fixed sequence
which groups go together.

01:11:59.010 --> 01:12:01.190
And what the sequence is?

01:12:01.190 --> 01:12:04.460
We have defined a
maximum green time

01:12:04.460 --> 01:12:07.440
that might be possible
for each direction.

01:12:07.440 --> 01:12:11.960
And we stop giving green if we
achieve a free flow situation.

01:12:11.960 --> 01:12:15.830
So I don't give green
to free flow traffic.

01:12:15.830 --> 01:12:17.490
And if the traffic's
still congested

01:12:17.490 --> 01:12:20.570
after a certain amount of time
we say, OK, now it's enough,

01:12:20.570 --> 01:12:23.560
now the others have to go.

01:12:23.560 --> 01:12:26.950
You have bus priority and light
rail priority and fire truck

01:12:26.950 --> 01:12:28.420
priority.

01:12:28.420 --> 01:12:31.090
And we don't build
intersections in Delft.

01:12:31.090 --> 01:12:34.720
We have a traffic light
sequence of 120 seconds.

01:12:34.720 --> 01:12:36.160
That's the max.

01:12:36.160 --> 01:12:39.610
So if the area is congested,
the maximum cycle time

01:12:39.610 --> 01:12:42.610
is 1 minute and 20 seconds.

01:12:42.610 --> 01:12:46.700
And my [INAUDIBLE] if you
look at our intersections,

01:12:46.700 --> 01:12:48.770
I'm trying to bring
back the cycle

01:12:48.770 --> 01:12:55.050
time for as many intersections
back to 90 seconds.

01:12:55.050 --> 01:12:57.660
And they did and for most
intersections it worked.

01:12:57.660 --> 01:13:01.260
And it was a huge
benefit for everybody.

01:13:01.260 --> 01:13:04.840
The maximum waiting time
is reduced 30 seconds.

01:13:04.840 --> 01:13:07.650
So if you missed going
first 30 seconds,

01:13:07.650 --> 01:13:10.420
you're simply reducing
the cycle time.

01:13:10.420 --> 01:13:12.000
You can also do it
physically, make

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.790
your intersections smaller.

01:13:14.790 --> 01:13:17.776
That's a huge benefit
for the cycling time.

01:13:17.776 --> 01:13:20.870
And we noticed
some intersections

01:13:20.870 --> 01:13:23.370
were pretty sharp, 90 seconds.

01:13:23.370 --> 01:13:25.150
People get used to
it so they didn't

01:13:25.150 --> 01:13:27.340
miss the first second of green.

01:13:27.340 --> 01:13:30.120
They were green,
[INAUDIBLE],, driving.

01:13:30.120 --> 01:13:33.860
So we could handle the
same number of cars

01:13:33.860 --> 01:13:35.890
in a shorter green time.

01:13:35.890 --> 01:13:39.880
A special one was the
fire truck priority.

01:13:39.880 --> 01:13:43.980
The fire department has a depot
exactly at that intersection.

01:13:43.980 --> 01:13:46.910
And they've got a
beautiful red button.

01:13:46.910 --> 01:13:49.870
So if I press that red
button, the intersection

01:13:49.870 --> 01:13:53.410
will stand in a way that
the order directions

01:13:53.410 --> 01:13:57.490
are blocked that the fire
department has to cross.

01:13:57.490 --> 01:13:59.770
So if you're not in
the direction of a fire

01:13:59.770 --> 01:14:01.810
that the fire
department has to go,

01:14:01.810 --> 01:14:06.130
you still get green because it
is an intelligence red button.

01:14:06.130 --> 01:14:10.090
So I press this button showing
I have a fire in Delft North,

01:14:10.090 --> 01:14:12.880
and they will follow this route.

01:14:12.880 --> 01:14:15.810
Then that route will get
green for the fire truck

01:14:15.810 --> 01:14:18.190
on the time we think
he will be there.

01:14:18.190 --> 01:14:21.950
So while driving North,
he continues detected,

01:14:21.950 --> 01:14:24.750
and the traffic lights
are switched that way

01:14:24.750 --> 01:14:27.000
that we will get green.

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:30.270
We do not block completely
all these intersections

01:14:30.270 --> 01:14:32.910
for the fire trucks since
he knows if we do so,

01:14:32.910 --> 01:14:36.180
we might cause a traffic jam
because all the directions

01:14:36.180 --> 01:14:37.680
are blocked.

01:14:37.680 --> 01:14:39.180
And that's the way
how we get there.

01:14:39.180 --> 01:14:43.410
And we also detect if you
pressed the right button

01:14:43.410 --> 01:14:47.225
and if we make a system that is
going perfectly to the north.

01:14:47.225 --> 01:14:51.020
Maybe he didn't use that
route but in certain times

01:14:51.020 --> 01:14:53.590
the system arguments,
OK, I did the measuring

01:14:53.590 --> 01:14:57.160
so somebody has disappeared
or gone somewhere else.

01:14:57.160 --> 01:14:59.470
Well let's switch
back to normal.

01:14:59.470 --> 01:15:01.760
That's the fire priority
we've got in Delft.

01:15:01.760 --> 01:15:05.160
And it was very important when
we built the railroad tunnel

01:15:05.160 --> 01:15:09.540
because the whole area
was under construction

01:15:09.540 --> 01:15:12.633
with all the traffic lights
kept to that priority.

01:15:15.580 --> 01:15:17.481
And that's the
example from Delft.

01:15:17.481 --> 01:15:17.980
Thank you.

01:15:24.354 --> 01:15:25.520
PETER FURTH: My new graphic.

01:15:29.130 --> 01:15:29.630
Yeah.

01:15:35.380 --> 01:15:41.050
So I told you that [AUDIO OUT]
are green extension, which

01:15:41.050 --> 01:15:43.240
is great if you've
got a far side stop

01:15:43.240 --> 01:15:44.650
and you can predict events.

01:15:44.650 --> 01:15:46.900
Early green, which is
a little more limited

01:15:46.900 --> 01:15:48.440
but we need more flexibility.

01:15:48.440 --> 01:15:51.010
So like what Jan was
describing there,

01:15:51.010 --> 01:15:56.270
they have these four
phases in the cycle.

01:15:56.270 --> 01:15:58.700
To make it simple,
let's just say

01:15:58.700 --> 01:16:07.820
we have east and west left
and then east and west through

01:16:07.820 --> 01:16:14.710
and then north and south
left and north and south

01:16:14.710 --> 01:16:20.580
through, phase one, two,
three, four, and the tram,

01:16:20.580 --> 01:16:22.110
in this case,
because it actually

01:16:22.110 --> 01:16:23.830
conflicts with all of them.

01:16:23.830 --> 01:16:28.140
So the normal thinking of a
traffic engineer would be,

01:16:28.140 --> 01:16:30.534
OK, and then we'll
have a tram phase here.

01:16:30.534 --> 01:16:31.575
And now that's the cycle.

01:16:34.540 --> 01:16:37.475
But the Delft thinking is,
we'll put a tram phase here,

01:16:37.475 --> 01:16:39.850
we'll put a tram phase here,
we'll put a tram phase here,

01:16:39.850 --> 01:16:41.650
and a tram phase here.

01:16:41.650 --> 01:16:43.390
And if there's no
tram, well we skip it.

01:16:43.390 --> 01:16:46.060
And if there is a tram,
then the tram gets to go.

01:16:46.060 --> 01:16:48.460
So the tram never
has to wait long.

01:16:48.460 --> 01:16:52.480
So that's part of the, if we
can get a man on the moon,

01:16:52.480 --> 01:16:54.890
we can turn the light green.

01:16:54.890 --> 01:17:01.710
So let me say something.

01:17:01.710 --> 01:17:04.090
I'll leave the rest
of these plans.

01:17:04.090 --> 01:17:06.330
They have some details there.

01:17:06.330 --> 01:17:09.720
But let me tell you something
about D Street and the Silver

01:17:09.720 --> 01:17:11.580
Line, OK?

01:17:11.580 --> 01:17:17.622
So the Waterfront Silver Line--

01:17:17.622 --> 01:17:19.740
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:17:19.740 --> 01:17:20.448
PETER FURTH: Huh?

01:17:20.448 --> 01:17:21.700
AUDIENCE: Do you have a video?

01:17:21.700 --> 01:17:22.533
PETER FURTH: No, no.

01:17:22.533 --> 01:17:25.000
I'm not going to do the video.

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.490
This is something new.

01:17:27.490 --> 01:17:29.740
How many of you are familiar
with the Silver Line that

01:17:29.740 --> 01:17:31.260
goes to and from the airport?

01:17:31.260 --> 01:17:33.130
Yeah.

01:17:33.130 --> 01:17:35.470
D street is where, if you're
going toward the airport,

01:17:35.470 --> 01:17:38.707
it comes out of the tunnel and
then it stops at a red light.

01:17:38.707 --> 01:17:41.040
And while you're waiting at
the red light you can watch,

01:17:41.040 --> 01:17:42.310
and there's no cars going by.

01:17:42.310 --> 01:17:44.180
And you think, why
is the light red?

01:17:44.180 --> 01:17:50.140
So on a map here's
Congress Street.

01:17:52.720 --> 01:17:55.120
This is D Street.

01:17:55.120 --> 01:17:58.180
And then this is
Silver Line Way.

01:17:58.180 --> 01:18:00.970
So the traffic
engineers are concerned

01:18:00.970 --> 01:18:02.800
that that's a short distance.

01:18:02.800 --> 01:18:05.320
And if they turn the light
red for Congress Street,

01:18:05.320 --> 01:18:06.890
two bad things can happen.

01:18:06.890 --> 01:18:08.680
One is spill back.

01:18:08.680 --> 01:18:11.770
Traffic comes to here,
oh, the light is red,

01:18:11.770 --> 01:18:16.240
and now queue spills back,
and it hurts the capacity.

01:18:16.240 --> 01:18:18.880
And the second
one is starvation.

01:18:18.880 --> 01:18:22.480
The light turns green here
for northbound traffic,

01:18:22.480 --> 01:18:24.580
but the light is still red here.

01:18:24.580 --> 01:18:28.430
So cars start to go, but nobody
can go because they're stuck.

01:18:28.430 --> 01:18:29.620
It's starved.

01:18:29.620 --> 01:18:35.410
So they don't want to
close D Street while either

01:18:35.410 --> 01:18:37.280
of those things can happen.

01:18:37.280 --> 01:18:40.330
So there is a cycle;
it's a 120 second cycle.

01:18:40.330 --> 01:18:42.370
This time I'll draw
the cycle in a circle.

01:18:42.370 --> 01:18:44.380
And they've decided
here is the time

01:18:44.380 --> 01:18:46.790
in the cycle the bus can go.

01:18:46.790 --> 01:18:48.970
So that's why you just
wait, you just wait.

01:18:48.970 --> 01:18:52.870
You arrive and you just wait
until your time in the cycle.

01:18:52.870 --> 01:18:55.660
So I just recently
had some students

01:18:55.660 --> 01:18:59.380
study it in my advanced
traffic control class.

01:18:59.380 --> 01:19:01.870
We actually took the whole
class there for a field trip

01:19:01.870 --> 01:19:05.350
during morning peak hour
because I had to see it myself.

01:19:05.350 --> 01:19:08.530
Is it really the disaster
people talk about?

01:19:08.530 --> 01:19:10.000
It is not a traffic disaster.

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:14.980
It is a transit disaster because
the frequency the Silver Line,

01:19:14.980 --> 01:19:16.629
it's about one bus
every two minutes,

01:19:16.629 --> 01:19:17.920
and they go in both directions.

01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:22.870
So that means in a
120 second cycle,

01:19:22.870 --> 01:19:24.310
if they're perfectly
on schedule,

01:19:24.310 --> 01:19:26.610
you'd have one bus at
most one per direction.

01:19:26.610 --> 01:19:27.670
Of course they're not.

01:19:27.670 --> 01:19:29.470
So often you've got
two buses, sometimes

01:19:29.470 --> 01:19:32.004
three buses waiting to go.

01:19:32.004 --> 01:19:34.042
And they wait, and they
wait, and they wait,

01:19:34.042 --> 01:19:35.500
and they wait, and
most of the time

01:19:35.500 --> 01:19:37.450
there is no conflicting traffic.

01:19:37.450 --> 01:19:42.050
So my students learn how
to do traffic simulations.

01:19:42.050 --> 01:19:43.990
There's some standard
packages for that.

01:19:43.990 --> 01:19:46.670
They learn how to program
their own traffic control.

01:19:46.670 --> 01:19:51.910
And they said, let's try just
all out aggressive priority.

01:19:51.910 --> 01:19:55.090
When we detect the bus,
we just stop the street,

01:19:55.090 --> 01:19:56.800
let the bus go through.

01:19:56.800 --> 01:20:01.840
The bus only needs like 14
seconds, and then it goes back.

01:20:01.840 --> 01:20:05.210
And I can hear
people saying, oh,

01:20:05.210 --> 01:20:08.290
but sometimes you've got to
serve two or three buses.

01:20:08.290 --> 01:20:11.630
Yeah, when buses have to wait
two minutes till their turn

01:20:11.630 --> 01:20:12.130
comes.

01:20:12.130 --> 01:20:14.200
But when they
don't have to wait,

01:20:14.200 --> 01:20:16.580
you're never going to be
serving more than one at a time.

01:20:16.580 --> 01:20:19.210
And it only takes 15 seconds.

01:20:19.210 --> 01:20:21.280
We put that into the
simulation to see, OK,

01:20:21.280 --> 01:20:23.080
how's it going to affect cars?

01:20:23.080 --> 01:20:26.070
How is it going to affect buses?

01:20:26.070 --> 01:20:29.430
Average delay for bus
goes from 50 seconds down

01:20:29.430 --> 01:20:31.330
to four seconds.

01:20:31.330 --> 01:20:33.140
Why four?

01:20:33.140 --> 01:20:36.020
That's only because if we do
turn the light green for a bus,

01:20:36.020 --> 01:20:40.664
for the cars a minimum 20
second before the next bus.

01:20:40.664 --> 01:20:42.080
So there's a bus
in one direction,

01:20:42.080 --> 01:20:44.020
the bus coming in
the other direction

01:20:44.020 --> 01:20:47.920
15 seconds later might
have to wait a few seconds.

01:20:47.920 --> 01:20:50.120
So delay for bus goes
down almost zero.

01:20:50.120 --> 01:20:55.140
Delay for cars also goes
down because the system

01:20:55.140 --> 01:20:59.662
they have now will stop the
cars even when there's no bus.

01:21:03.540 --> 01:21:06.440
I don't know why.

01:21:06.440 --> 01:21:08.960
And there's another thing
about the system they have now

01:21:08.960 --> 01:21:10.410
that is not so intelligent.

01:21:10.410 --> 01:21:16.390
So the main message
I want to get across

01:21:16.390 --> 01:21:22.780
is the old way I said is if
we can put a man on the moon,

01:21:22.780 --> 01:21:25.960
we can get the light to
turn green for the bus.

01:21:25.960 --> 01:21:32.020
That is if you use
intelligent tactics,

01:21:32.020 --> 01:21:35.350
we can almost always
reduce the delay

01:21:35.350 --> 01:21:39.910
for a bus down to near
zero without really

01:21:39.910 --> 01:21:42.290
increasing the delay for cars.

01:21:42.290 --> 01:21:44.790
Bus only needs a few
seconds to get through.

01:21:44.790 --> 01:21:47.720
They just need a few
seconds at the right time.

01:21:47.720 --> 01:21:50.810
Just rearrange the
time a little bit.

01:21:50.810 --> 01:21:53.960
Give the bus the
green when it needs.

01:21:53.960 --> 01:21:57.740
And what's in the way is
this inflexible paradigm

01:21:57.740 --> 01:22:03.890
of fixed time control with a
fixed cycle, long fixed cycles.

01:22:03.890 --> 01:22:06.605
Like Jan was saying, the
long cycles are killer.

01:22:06.605 --> 01:22:10.190
If you have short cycles,
the delay won't be too much.

01:22:14.320 --> 01:22:19.810
So what Europe has done
with transit priority

01:22:19.810 --> 01:22:20.586
is just amazing.

01:22:20.586 --> 01:22:22.210
Some of the things
that I saw there, it

01:22:22.210 --> 01:22:25.390
just blew my mind
how they're just

01:22:25.390 --> 01:22:26.770
giving priority to transit.

01:22:26.770 --> 01:22:27.436
They just do it.

01:22:27.436 --> 01:22:28.255
They just do it.

01:22:28.255 --> 01:22:30.150
They just do it.

01:22:30.150 --> 01:22:32.680
There was an intersection
in The Hague,

01:22:32.680 --> 01:22:36.460
right near Delft, where a
tram line was intersecting

01:22:36.460 --> 01:22:38.050
the main ring road.

01:22:38.050 --> 01:22:42.710
Lots of traffic and
big traffic jams.

01:22:42.710 --> 01:22:45.740
And my friends are telling me,
oh yeah, big traffic jams here.

01:22:45.740 --> 01:22:46.550
How come?

01:22:46.550 --> 01:22:49.100
Well because we have to
give the tram priority.

01:22:49.100 --> 01:22:53.040
It's like you just have to.

01:22:53.040 --> 01:22:57.080
You drink coffee in the morning,
and you give the tram priority.

01:22:57.080 --> 01:22:59.990
Who would ever think of making
the tram wait at a red light?

01:22:59.990 --> 01:23:00.800
No!

01:23:00.800 --> 01:23:02.660
You have to give
the tram priority.

01:23:02.660 --> 01:23:04.010
And there are lots of trams.

01:23:04.010 --> 01:23:06.480
And it's causing
a big traffic jam.

01:23:06.480 --> 01:23:08.390
So what's the solution?

01:23:08.390 --> 01:23:12.290
Spend a lot of money, grade
separation, and now the tram

01:23:12.290 --> 01:23:14.434
has absolutely zero delay.

01:23:14.434 --> 01:23:16.850
And the cars go underneath,
and they have no delay either,

01:23:16.850 --> 01:23:18.170
and everybody's happy.

01:23:18.170 --> 01:23:21.670
But it started because
of this attitude

01:23:21.670 --> 01:23:26.620
that we just give priority to
our important transit lines.

01:23:26.620 --> 01:23:31.240
So if we have that
attitude, we can

01:23:31.240 --> 01:23:34.800
do it a lot better
than what we're doing.

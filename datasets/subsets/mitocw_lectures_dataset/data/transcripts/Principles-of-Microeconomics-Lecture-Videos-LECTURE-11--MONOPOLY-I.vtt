00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:14.900
JONATHAN GRUBER: OK,
so let's continue.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.050
So this is actually,
in some sense,

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:19.860
a key breaking
point in the course.

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:22.430
Which is, in some sense
what we've done so far

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:25.160
is give you a set of
tools to understand

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.378
how to think about how consumers
and producers make decisions,

00:00:28.378 --> 00:00:30.920
and then to understand how you
compare positive and normative

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.868
implications of economics.

00:00:32.868 --> 00:00:34.910
What we're going to do
for the rest of the class,

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.430
for the rest of the
semester, is we're

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.210
going to start to talk about how
you apply those tools to more

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:42.640
realistic situations.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.140
Let me answer your very first
question, what you learn today

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.240
is not on the midterm, OK?

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:51.320
So that's the question that's
all on your mind because it is.

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.660
So the midterm tomorrow
night will cover everything

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.825
through what we covered
through last week,

00:00:55.825 --> 00:00:57.950
but what we learn today
will not be in the midterm.

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:00.340
But don't leave because
it will be on the final

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:01.670
and it is interesting.

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.320
So what we're going
to do today is

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.190
talk about taking the tools we
developed so far in this class

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.640
and applying to more
realistic situations.

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.310
And the more realist situation
we're going to start with

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.590
is the case of monopoly.

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.350
And we don't talk about
monopoly profit maximization.

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.200
Now so far on the
producer side we've

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.450
been discussing one extreme
of how the market's organized,

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.370
which is perfect competition.

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:31.220
And perfect competition
is a wonderful sort

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.680
of theoretical
benchmark but never

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:34.970
actually exists in reality.

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.680
No market is
perfectly competitive.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.800
The other extreme is not widely
applicable but still does

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.110
exist in reality,
which is monopoly, OK?

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:52.570
Monopoly is a situation where a
market only has one firm in it.

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:58.300
So a market with one firm
is a monopoly market, OK?

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.960
So that's basically a case
where you have only one

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.570
firm providing the good, OK?

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.840
Now in reality,
most markets fall

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.460
between perfect competition,
which never truly exists,

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.720
and monopoly, which
rarely exists.

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.200
Most markets are in between,
we call them oligopolies.

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.830
That's markets
with several firms

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.750
but not perfectly competing.

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.035
And we'll get to that.

00:02:24.035 --> 00:02:26.410
But that's actually one of
the harder things we'll cover,

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.780
so we're going to start with
this other extreme of monopoly

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.460
which gives us a lot
of the insights we

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:35.070
need for oligopoly but
in a much simpler case.

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.880
Now, the key thing with
monopoly, the key difference

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.150
from what we've done so
far is that now firms

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.200
are going to be price
makers, not price takers.

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.900
That's going to be the key
change from the perfectly

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:49.830
competitive situation.

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.660
The perfectly
competitive situation,

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.700
from any given
firm's perspective

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.280
the price is something given
them by the great market.

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.170
OK, we talked with
our two diagrams side

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.170
by side about how the
market gives the price.

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.810
But we sort of-- from any
given firm's perspective

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.190
they were price taker.

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:06.880
They couldn't affect the price.

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.260
Monopolists however,
when you're the only firm

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.330
you get to set the price.

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:16.260
So monopolists are going to be
price makers, not price takers.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.980
And that's going to change the
dynamics of everything we do,

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.020
and that'll be our
focus today, OK?

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:25.750
So that's going to
be the big change,

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:30.520
we'll go from competitive
markets to monopoly markets.

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:35.410
Now, for the first 2/3
or 3/4 of the lecture

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:37.430
we're going to make
one other assumption.

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:43.120
We are going to assume there is
one price in this market, that

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.148
is no price discrimination.

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.810
This monopolist sets
the price, but he

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.240
sets one price for everybody.

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.550
So if a monopolist
is selling a good,

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:00.350
they sell that at one price
to everybody buys the good.

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:02.557
Now once again, this
is not super realistic,

00:04:02.557 --> 00:04:04.640
monopolists often have
different prices for goods.

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.827
But it's a very important,
helpful extreme.

00:04:06.827 --> 00:04:09.410
And you've got to remember that
we're imposing this constraint

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:11.285
because it's going to
drive the intuition I'm

00:04:11.285 --> 00:04:12.440
going to come to next, OK?

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.380
So you're a firm selling
a good at one price.

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:20.019
You offer it up, anybody can
buy it at that price, OK?

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:22.300
Now, what we're going to do--

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.010
if you remember, a mon-- the
fundamental part of producer

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:27.910
that holds is the
goal of monopolists

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:35.320
is to maximize his profits, OK,
which is revenues minus costs.

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.330
And as we showed
before, profits are

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:42.320
maximized when marginal
revenue equals marginal cost.

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.710
That's the profit
maximization point.

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:49.160
Now, nothing on the cost
side is going to change.

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:54.200
So monopolish monopolist,
the way we get cost curves

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:54.893
doesn't change.

00:04:54.893 --> 00:04:56.810
That's all about--
remember, because that just

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:59.670
comes the technology
production and that

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:02.512
comes from input prices.

00:05:02.512 --> 00:05:04.470
So nothing on the cost
side is going to change.

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.300
All that hard and
somewhat boring

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.470
work we did deriving
cost functions and stuff,

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:11.490
that all is-- that's done.

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:13.740
The only place monopoly gets
exciting is on the margin

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:17.010
revenue side, because before we
said marginal revenue was just

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:19.500
price for a price taker.

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:21.640
But that's no longer true.

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:24.303
Marginal revenue is
no longer just price.

00:05:24.303 --> 00:05:26.470
Now marginal revenue's going
to be more interesting.

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:29.020
So the monopoly
difference, if you will,

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:31.890
or the imperfect
competition difference,

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:34.032
doesn't come at all
from the cost side.

00:05:34.032 --> 00:05:36.240
That side is done, doesn't
matter what kind of market

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.650
you're looking at, OK?

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:40.120
All the interesting
action here is

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:43.480
on the revenue side as we think
about monopoly and oligopoly

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:45.280
markets, OK?

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.910
So to think about that,
let's go to figure 11-1.

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:55.370
Think about-- let's start by
think about a competitive firm.

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:56.825
This is a diagram I
could have shown earlier.

00:05:56.825 --> 00:05:59.450
It just sort of is a way to
think about a competitive firm.

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:02.840
Think about a competitive
firm's profits.

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:06.260
So imagine that this firm--

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:10.340
to make life easy
let's imagine that we

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:15.080
have a firm with
marginal cost of 0, OK?

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:20.660
So you've got demand curve, and
so therefore any money you make

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:21.680
is profit.

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:22.982
And we're in the short run, OK?

00:06:22.982 --> 00:06:24.440
So there's profit
in the short run,

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:26.820
even for this perfectly
competitive firm.

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:29.430
But a perfectly competitive
firm faces a horizontal demand

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:30.160
curve.

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:34.770
So if they sell
q units, OK, they

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:38.010
make profits of area
a, which is simply

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:41.700
q times P1, little q times P1.

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:44.130
If they sell q
plus 1 units, they

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:46.980
make an extra profit
rectangle of B.

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:49.860
So literally, the marginal--
the extra profit they make

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:54.840
is just the amount
P. It's 1 times P1.

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:58.190
The horizontal distance
from q to q plus 1 is 1,

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:00.390
the vertical distance is P1.

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:03.358
So the marginal profit
is just the price, OK?

00:07:03.358 --> 00:07:05.400
Marginal revenue, I'm
sorry, it's just the price.

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:06.352
Yeah?

00:07:06.352 --> 00:07:08.310
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
competitive [INAUDIBLE]..

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:10.800
JONATHAN GRUBER: Once it's in
the short run there can be,

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:11.010
right?

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:12.600
In the short run there can be
profit in a competitive market.

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:14.868
In the long run
there's no profit, OK?

00:07:14.868 --> 00:07:16.410
So basically, their
marginal revenue,

00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:21.390
what they make-- that next unit
they make is the price, OK?

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:25.810
Now let's think about
a monopoly firm.

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:31.410
A monopoly firm does not face a
perfectly elastic demand curve

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:34.590
because a monopoly firm's demand
curve is the whole market.

00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:38.970
Notice little q has become
big Q on the x-axis.

00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:41.910
The monopolist no longer faces
only their perfectly elastic

00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:43.230
firm demand.

00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:46.710
They face a market demand, which
can be any degree of elasticity

00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:48.270
but typically is
somewhat elastic.

00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:50.350
It's downward sloping.

00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:51.910
Now let's say
you're a monopolist

00:07:51.910 --> 00:07:56.070
and you're selling big
Q units at a price P1.

00:07:56.070 --> 00:08:00.530
Your profits are C plus A. Once
again, same marginal cost of 0

00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:03.060
to make this easy, or C plus A.

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:06.050
Now let's say you want
to sell one more unit.

00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:07.720
Well, what's different?

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:09.420
What's different is
now you're facing

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:11.770
a downward sloping demand curve.

00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:13.950
So if you want to
sell one more unit

00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:16.800
you have to lower the price.

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:18.390
That's the difference.

00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:20.520
If you want to
sell another unit,

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:23.880
you can only do so by
lowering the price.

00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:26.490
And you're a price maker, so
you have the right to do that.

00:08:26.490 --> 00:08:27.990
So if you want to
sell another unit,

00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:30.610
two things are going to happen.

00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:33.789
A, you are going to
sell a second unit

00:08:33.789 --> 00:08:35.110
and make money on that unit.

00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:38.539
That's the area B.

00:08:38.539 --> 00:08:40.380
But b-- I should
say one and two.

00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:41.630
One, you sell the second unit.

00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:43.415
That's the area B.

00:08:43.415 --> 00:08:46.040
Two, you will lose money
all the other units

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:50.030
you sold because now you
have to lower the price.

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:54.210
Because remember, there's
only one price, OK?

00:08:54.210 --> 00:08:57.920
So basically, you
used to make A plus C.

00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:04.010
Now you make A plus B. You've
added B, but you've lost C.

00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:06.080
So what is the marginal revenue?

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:08.390
The marginal revenue
for a monopolist

00:09:08.390 --> 00:09:16.415
is now the area B minus the
area C. Or P2, which is area B--

00:09:16.415 --> 00:09:24.860
1 times P2 minus
P2 minus P1 minus

00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:30.140
P2 times Q0, the
original quantity.

00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:31.530
OK?

00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:33.420
This is the area C,
but this is the area

00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:38.330
B. The original quantity
times the change in price.

00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:40.670
So your marginal revenue is
not this simple just priced

00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:41.253
more and more.

00:09:41.253 --> 00:09:44.690
Now it's this more
complicated term, OK?

00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:48.710
More generally, marginal
revenue can be defined

00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:53.810
as-- the marginal
revenue is defined as--

00:09:53.810 --> 00:10:04.630
marginal revenue is defined as
P plus delta P delta Q times Q.

00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:08.200
That's marginal revenue.

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:10.600
The first term is
positive, that's

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:13.820
the money you make
on the next unit.

00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:17.260
The second term is negative
because, by definition,

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:18.940
the demand curve's
downward sloping.

00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:20.920
There's no given goods
anymore in this class.

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:23.040
Demand may be on a test
but not in reality.

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:26.740
The demand curve's
downward sloping, OK?

00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:29.010
So this term is negative.

00:10:29.010 --> 00:10:30.770
Now once again,
I'm writing delta

00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:31.980
but really it's derivative.

00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:33.855
So this is all increment--
this is all-- this

00:10:33.855 --> 00:10:35.030
is sort of epsilon changes.

00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:37.280
This is Q0, OK?

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:38.870
This is sort of epsilon changes.

00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:41.390
But the bottom line is, for
an epsilon change in price

00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:42.660
you get--

00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:46.120
for an epsilon
change in quantity

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:48.820
you get the price
on the unit you

00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:50.550
sell minus the money you lost.

00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:53.350
And then you too can
no longer sell, OK?

00:10:53.350 --> 00:10:57.960
This is the key intuition
of monopoly math.

00:10:57.960 --> 00:10:58.737
The k-- yeah?

00:10:58.737 --> 00:11:00.404
AUDIENCE: What's that
equation equal to?

00:11:00.404 --> 00:11:02.720
That [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:05.370
JONATHAN GRUBER: This is
your marginal revenue.

00:11:05.370 --> 00:11:06.820
I just did it graphically.

00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:09.030
That's your marginal revenue.

00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:10.760
You just see that
from the graph, OK,

00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:13.183
and I just rewrote it here, OK?

00:11:13.183 --> 00:11:15.600
So basica-- or for those of
you into calculus, if you just

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:20.280
differentiate, just-- if those
of you who have your calculus,

00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:25.950
you could just write, you
know, dR dQ, d revenue dQ, OK,

00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:26.860
what do you get?

00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:31.620
You get P plus dP dQ
times Q. That's just

00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:37.350
the derivative of revenue
with respect to quantity, OK?

00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:40.660
So let's think
intuitively about what's

00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:43.750
going on here because this
is very, very important.

00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:47.110
What's going on here
is to sell another unit

00:11:47.110 --> 00:11:49.360
you have to lower your price.

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:51.670
You're working your way
down your demand curve.

00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:53.920
And therefore, it
offsets the benefit

00:11:53.920 --> 00:12:00.120
you get from selling
another unit, OK?

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:03.780
I like to call this
the poisoning effect.

00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:08.780
I mean, it's not
original to me but it's

00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:11.930
a term that I've heard use that
I like, the poisoning effect.

00:12:11.930 --> 00:12:14.850
The idea is that to
sell another unit,

00:12:14.850 --> 00:12:16.700
I have to poison
myself a little bit

00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:21.632
by lowering the price on all
the previous units I sold.

00:12:21.632 --> 00:12:23.840
If I want to go out in the
market and force consumers

00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:25.970
to buy one more unit, I've
got to lower the price

00:12:25.970 --> 00:12:30.050
on all the units which
offsets money I used to make.

00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:33.540
So that's why we call it a
sort of poisoning effect.

00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:37.590
Now, why doesn't a competitive
firm face this issue?

00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:39.293
Why are we just
bringing this up now?

00:12:39.293 --> 00:12:41.293
Why does a monopoly firm
face a poisoning effect

00:12:41.293 --> 00:12:42.585
and a competitive firm doesn't?

00:12:42.585 --> 00:12:44.626
Or alternatively, another
way to ask the question

00:12:44.626 --> 00:12:46.500
is, in what situation
would a monopoly firm

00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:48.930
not face a poisoning effect?

00:12:48.930 --> 00:12:50.531
Yeah?

00:12:50.531 --> 00:12:53.140
AUDIENCE: Actually,
in a [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:59.622
in a competitive
firm [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:59.622 --> 00:13:00.580
JONATHAN GRUBER: Right.

00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:02.205
They're not-- that's
[INAUDIBLE] right.

00:13:02.205 --> 00:13:03.930
The competitive firm's
the price taker.

00:13:03.930 --> 00:13:07.410
But in particular, even
though the price taker,

00:13:07.410 --> 00:13:11.240
why when they sell more quantity
is there no poisoning effect?

00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:11.810
Yeah?

00:13:11.810 --> 00:13:13.080
AUDIENCE: Demand is
perfectly inelastic?

00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:15.140
JONATHAN GRUBER: Demand
it's is perfectly elastic.

00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:16.557
The firm faced a
perfectly elast--

00:13:16.557 --> 00:13:20.060
so likewise, a monopolist facing
a perfectly elastic demand

00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:22.340
would also have no
poisoning effect.

00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:25.240
Think of it this
way, what is dP dQ

00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:26.790
with perfectly elastic demand?

00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:28.730
Zero.

00:13:28.730 --> 00:13:30.530
The price doesn't
change, you sell more.

00:13:30.530 --> 00:13:33.140
So the reason the
perfectly competitive firm

00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:35.270
face no poisoning effect
is because it's facing a--

00:13:35.270 --> 00:13:36.830
it doesn't, the
price doesn't have

00:13:36.830 --> 00:13:39.502
to change to sell
more units, OK?

00:13:39.502 --> 00:13:41.210
But a monopolist faces
a poisoning effect

00:13:41.210 --> 00:13:45.225
because it's got a downward
sloping demand curve.

00:13:45.225 --> 00:13:46.220
OK?

00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:47.910
So we can actually see this--

00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:51.950
so what we want to
do in figure 11-3

00:13:51.950 --> 00:13:56.430
is we graph the monopolist's
marginal revenue curve.

00:13:56.430 --> 00:13:58.400
So let's actually work
out the math here.

00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:01.167
Let's imagine there's
a demand curve.

00:14:01.167 --> 00:14:03.000
Let's imagine that I've
got a demand curve--

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.510
and I'm just making this
up-- demands of the form A

00:14:05.510 --> 00:14:08.150
equals 24 minus p, OK?

00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:12.530
Let's just say that's
the demand curve, OK?

00:14:12.530 --> 00:14:17.270
Now the first step is to
flip the way we express this

00:14:17.270 --> 00:14:20.060
and write this-- write price
as a function of quantity

00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:22.200
because now the monopolist
is choosing his price.

00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:26.060
So we can write that p
equals 24 minus Q, OK?

00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:29.540
Just inverting it, writing
price as a function of quantity.

00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:33.950
So in this case revenues,
which are equal to p times Q,

00:14:33.950 --> 00:14:37.640
are equal to 24Q
minus Q squared.

00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:41.540
I just multiply through by Q.

00:14:41.540 --> 00:14:45.230
So marginal revenues
differentiating

00:14:45.230 --> 00:14:50.398
are just 24 minus 2Q, OK?

00:14:50.398 --> 00:14:52.690
So once again, this is a new
sort of mathematical trick

00:14:52.690 --> 00:14:54.690
you'll have to get used to.

00:14:54.690 --> 00:14:56.500
Flip the demand curve,
so you express price

00:14:56.500 --> 00:14:57.870
as a function of quantity.

00:14:57.870 --> 00:15:02.340
Multiply through by Q
and then differentiate,

00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:06.810
and you get that marginal
revenue is 24 minus 2Q.

00:15:06.810 --> 00:15:09.030
So you can see that
in figure 11-3,

00:15:09.030 --> 00:15:15.050
the marginal revenue curve is
the demand curve shifted in,

00:15:15.050 --> 00:15:16.520
OK?

00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:21.260
Now in fact, this
nice relationship

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:22.220
will not always hold.

00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:23.690
This sort of picture
of a marginal revenue

00:15:23.690 --> 00:15:24.810
curve being the demand
curve shift [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:24.810 --> 00:15:25.410
will not always hold.

00:15:25.410 --> 00:15:27.290
It only holds for
certain functional forms.

00:15:27.290 --> 00:15:29.870
Mostly we'll use functional
forms for where it holds.

00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:32.330
The main lesson is the
marginal revenue curve

00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:35.480
has to be at or below
the demand curve.

00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:37.100
That's the proof, OK?

00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:40.130
Whether it has this nice sort
of shifted in relationship,

00:15:40.130 --> 00:15:42.555
that depends very much
on functional form.

00:15:42.555 --> 00:15:44.930
But what is absolutely true
is the marginal revenue curve

00:15:44.930 --> 00:15:48.530
is always everywhere at
or below the demand curve.

00:15:48.530 --> 00:15:49.280
Why?

00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:51.260
Because the demand curve--

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:53.210
because by selling
a next unit you're

00:15:53.210 --> 00:15:55.575
going to make less through
this poisoning effect.

00:15:55.575 --> 00:15:57.200
So the marginal
revenue curve is always

00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:00.590
below the demand
curve, all right?

00:16:00.590 --> 00:16:03.720
Questions about that?

00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:10.470
OK, so now let's go on and
let's talk about the critical

00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:12.600
relationship which I just
developed-- intuitive,

00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:14.220
let's do it mathematically--

00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:19.630
between marginal revenue and
the elasticity of demand.

00:16:19.630 --> 00:16:22.410
OK, so take this--

00:16:22.410 --> 00:16:29.740
we've got our marginal
revenue expression,

00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:40.180
marginal revenue equals p plus
delta p delta Q times Q, OK?

00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:43.540
Now take that expression and
multiply and divide by p.

00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:45.290
So I'm just going to
take this expression,

00:16:45.290 --> 00:16:48.770
I'm going to multiply
and divide by p, OK?

00:16:48.770 --> 00:16:53.240
Then I'm going to
get p plus delta

00:16:53.240 --> 00:17:02.360
p over p delta Q over
Q times Q over p--

00:17:05.348 --> 00:17:06.286
oh, p plus p.

00:17:06.286 --> 00:17:07.619
I'm sorry, no, I did this wrong.

00:17:07.619 --> 00:17:09.054
My bad, don't write that down.

00:17:09.054 --> 00:17:11.266
I've got to look
more at my notes.

00:17:11.266 --> 00:17:12.349
I'm going to write it as--

00:17:12.349 --> 00:17:13.932
I'm going to multiply
and divide by p.

00:17:13.932 --> 00:17:21.890
p plus p times, yeah, delta
p delta Q times Q over p.

00:17:21.890 --> 00:17:23.569
I skipped a step.

00:17:23.569 --> 00:17:25.310
So I just multiplied
and divided by p,

00:17:25.310 --> 00:17:26.869
multiplied and divided by p.

00:17:26.869 --> 00:17:31.810
p plus p times delta Q, delta
p over delta Q times Q over p,

00:17:31.810 --> 00:17:32.570
OK?

00:17:32.570 --> 00:17:36.020
Now if you look at this
expression, delta p over delta

00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:39.080
Q times Q over p,
that is the inverse

00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:42.330
of the elasticity of demand.

00:17:42.330 --> 00:17:48.160
So you can rewrite this
as p plus p times 1

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:51.510
over the elasticity of demand.

00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:54.270
Or rewriting one more
time, that marginal revenue

00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:59.630
equals p times 1 plus 1 over
the elasticity of demand.

00:17:59.630 --> 00:18:03.110
Marginal revenue
equals p times 1 plus 1

00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:06.870
over the elasticity of demand.

00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:08.730
So think about
this for a second.

00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:11.360
This gets the intuition
we just talked about.

00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:13.890
If e is-- if the elasticity
is negative infinite--

00:18:13.890 --> 00:18:15.510
is negative infinity--

00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:16.587
OK I had it wrong with 0.

00:18:16.587 --> 00:18:19.170
It's the elasticity of demand
is negative infinity then you've

00:18:19.170 --> 00:18:20.213
a competitive market.

00:18:20.213 --> 00:18:22.380
Perfectly competitive market
is elasticity of demand

00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:28.280
negative infinity so you get
a competitive market, OK?

00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:30.380
As the elasticity of demand--

00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:39.460
but if the elasticity of demand
is 0, if the elasticity of--

00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:42.285
if the elasticity of demand goes
like-- the elasticity of demand

00:18:42.285 --> 00:18:43.110
is negative 1.

00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:44.060
Let's do that case.

00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:47.510
So negative infinity is
perfectly competitive, OK?

00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:49.070
What about negative 1?

00:18:49.070 --> 00:18:51.020
What's special about
the elasticity of demand

00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:53.630
of negative 1 in this case?

00:18:53.630 --> 00:18:55.940
What's the marginal revenue?

00:18:55.940 --> 00:18:57.080
0.

00:18:57.080 --> 00:19:00.020
That's the case going
back to figure 11-2 where

00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:03.263
B and C exactly cancel out.

00:19:03.263 --> 00:19:04.680
So you probably
thought about this

00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:05.580
when you looked at this graph.

00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:07.330
You probably quickly
asked yourself, well,

00:19:07.330 --> 00:19:09.270
should the monopolist
try to sell more or not?

00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:11.103
Well the answer is, the
elasticity of demand

00:19:11.103 --> 00:19:13.690
is minus 1, they're indifferent.

00:19:13.690 --> 00:19:15.490
So this is sort of
the important insight.

00:19:15.490 --> 00:19:17.665
With an elastic
demand of minus 1,

00:19:17.665 --> 00:19:20.918
me monopolist is indifferent
about selling another unit

00:19:20.918 --> 00:19:22.960
because what they gain
from selling the unit they

00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:24.765
lose on the previous units.

00:19:24.765 --> 00:19:26.890
If the elasticity of demand
is greater than minus 1

00:19:26.890 --> 00:19:29.410
absolute value, then
they're going to lose money

00:19:29.410 --> 00:19:32.450
by selling additional units.

00:19:32.450 --> 00:19:36.030
If the elasticity of
demand is less than 1,

00:19:36.030 --> 00:19:40.398
then they're going to make money
by selling additional units.

00:19:40.398 --> 00:19:41.690
But let's-- I'm skipping ahead.

00:19:41.690 --> 00:19:46.080
Let's go on and talk about
profit maximization, OK?

00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:48.690
So let's go on and take the
next step which is the monopoly

00:19:48.690 --> 00:19:50.580
profit maximization.

00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:53.100
Imagine a monopolist's
cost function curve is

00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:55.485
of the form 12 plus q squared.

00:19:55.485 --> 00:19:57.360
Let's take the same
monopolist and write down

00:19:57.360 --> 00:20:02.340
cost function of 12
plus q squared, OK?

00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:07.800
So with this cost function,
marginal cost equals 2q.

00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:11.070
That's marginal cost with
this cost function, OK?

00:20:11.070 --> 00:20:13.980
So what's the profit
maximization rule?

00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:17.265
It's that marginal revenue
equals marginal cost.

00:20:17.265 --> 00:20:23.380
Well marginal revenue, we wrote
down here, is 24 minus 2Q,

00:20:23.380 --> 00:20:28.225
so it's where 24 minus
2Q equals marginal--

00:20:28.225 --> 00:20:31.077
I should-- equals marginal cost.

00:20:31.077 --> 00:20:32.660
Now with monopolists
here's the trick,

00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:34.420
little q and big Q are the same.

00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:36.130
So I wrote a little
q here, but if you're

00:20:36.130 --> 00:20:38.200
the only firm in the
market little q and big Q

00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:39.265
are the same, right?

00:20:39.265 --> 00:20:41.050
There's only one
firm in the market.

00:20:41.050 --> 00:20:42.910
So 24 minus 2Q equals--

00:20:42.910 --> 00:20:46.450
it's a big Q now-- equals 2Q.

00:20:46.450 --> 00:20:51.370
So the optimization point
is where 24 equals 4Q or Q

00:20:51.370 --> 00:20:54.390
star equals six.

00:20:54.390 --> 00:20:58.320
That's the optimal-- that's
the profit maximizing

00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:02.610
sale on quantity for
the monopolist is

00:21:02.610 --> 00:21:05.310
where 24 minus 2Q, where
marginal revenue equals

00:21:05.310 --> 00:21:05.950
marginal cost.

00:21:05.950 --> 00:21:09.210
We derive marginal revenue, OK?

00:21:09.210 --> 00:21:12.390
Marginal cost we know how to
derive from our cost function.

00:21:12.390 --> 00:21:16.830
We set them equal and we get
the optimizing quantity, OK?

00:21:16.830 --> 00:21:19.695
And you can see
this in figure 11-4.

00:21:25.170 --> 00:21:28.790
Figure 11-4 shows
what's going on here.

00:21:28.790 --> 00:21:30.320
So I've driven all the va--

00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:34.500
I've drawn all the various cost
curves for this cost function,

00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:35.895
OK?

00:21:35.895 --> 00:21:37.270
I've driven all
the various costs

00:21:37.270 --> 00:21:39.760
first for this cost function.

00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:42.190
You can see the
marginal cost curve

00:21:42.190 --> 00:21:44.770
and then you can see it
intersects the marginal revenue

00:21:44.770 --> 00:21:48.990
curve at a quantity of 6.

00:21:48.990 --> 00:21:53.340
Intersects the marginal revenue
curve at a quantity of 6, OK?

00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:56.066
What is the price?

00:21:56.066 --> 00:21:58.320
Someone raise their hand
and tell me, tell me why.

00:21:58.320 --> 00:21:59.470
The quantity 6, what's--

00:21:59.470 --> 00:22:01.250
what price has the
monopolist set?

00:22:01.250 --> 00:22:01.833
Yeah?

00:22:01.833 --> 00:22:02.437
AUDIENCE: 18.

00:22:02.437 --> 00:22:03.270
JONATHAN GRUBER: 18.

00:22:03.270 --> 00:22:04.800
Why-- you're supposed
to get that wrong.

00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:06.810
You didn't-- you didn't, you
didn't follow my instructions,

00:22:06.810 --> 00:22:07.850
you didn't get it wrong.

00:22:07.850 --> 00:22:09.270
You got it right,
I'm just joking.

00:22:09.270 --> 00:22:11.220
How did you know it
was 18 and not 12?

00:22:11.220 --> 00:22:13.470
Usually people guess 12
because that's the point where

00:22:13.470 --> 00:22:14.345
the curves intersect.

00:22:14.345 --> 00:22:15.030
Why is it 18?

00:22:15.030 --> 00:22:16.210
AUDIENCE: You can go
up to the demand curve

00:22:16.210 --> 00:22:17.370
because that's what
people are willin--

00:22:17.370 --> 00:22:19.245
JONATHAN GRUBER: Because
even the monopolist,

00:22:19.245 --> 00:22:22.590
as powerful as he is,
has to respect demand.

00:22:22.590 --> 00:22:25.600
So the monopolist if they're
going to sell 6 units,

00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:28.390
they have to choose a
price such that people

00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:30.020
want to buy 6 units.

00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:31.667
So your intuition,
which is my fault--

00:22:31.667 --> 00:22:33.750
I've always said, look
where the curves intersect,

00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:35.110
do a quantity and a price--

00:22:35.110 --> 00:22:37.068
your quick intuition,
which was to look and say

00:22:37.068 --> 00:22:40.930
the price was 12, which was the
wrong answer I usually get, OK,

00:22:40.930 --> 00:22:44.290
is wrong because you
need to actually respect

00:22:44.290 --> 00:22:46.000
the demand curve.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.580
So a monopolist solves
for the optimal quantity,

00:22:48.580 --> 00:22:50.410
but then to get
the optimal price

00:22:50.410 --> 00:22:52.400
he has to plug this back
into the demand curve.

00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:53.650
Well, what's demand?

00:22:53.650 --> 00:22:56.860
Demand is 24 minus p.

00:22:56.860 --> 00:23:00.500
So-- I'm sorry, it's p equals
24 minus Q, that's our demand.

00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:08.480
So if Q star is 6, then
price is 24 minus 6, or 18.

00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:13.580
P star is 18, and that is
what you will get wrong

00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:14.493
when you do this.

00:23:14.493 --> 00:23:16.910
If you're going to get anything
wrong in monopoly problems

00:23:16.910 --> 00:23:18.952
this is what you're going
to get wrong, OK, which

00:23:18.952 --> 00:23:20.750
is remembering you can't just--

00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:23.630
at the end you have to
do an extra step here.

00:23:23.630 --> 00:23:26.930
To get the price you have
to solve for quantity,

00:23:26.930 --> 00:23:29.550
but then respect the demand
curve to get the price.

00:23:29.550 --> 00:23:31.820
There's a question somewhere.

00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:33.415
OK, yeah, question?

00:23:33.415 --> 00:23:38.922
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] of the
intersection of the [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:38.922 --> 00:23:40.380
JONATHAN GRUBER:
It's pretty much--

00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:42.930
yeah, it's pretty
much meaningless.

00:23:42.930 --> 00:23:46.400
So that intersection used to
pin down the quantity, but price

00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:47.960
has to come from
the demand curve

00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:49.460
because you have to respect--

00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:50.877
you can't sell
something consumers

00:23:50.877 --> 00:23:52.488
don't want to buy, OK?

00:23:52.488 --> 00:23:54.280
So you've got to respect
that demand curve.

00:23:57.440 --> 00:24:01.860
And in fact, you
can show yourself--

00:24:01.860 --> 00:24:08.350
so basically-- OK,
so basically that's

00:24:08.350 --> 00:24:13.790
the profit maximization except
this stupid goddamn shutdown

00:24:13.790 --> 00:24:15.155
rule still holds.

00:24:15.155 --> 00:24:17.655
In the short run we still have
to respect to shut down rule,

00:24:17.655 --> 00:24:20.270
so you still have
to check, is price

00:24:20.270 --> 00:24:22.320
less than average variable cost?

00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:26.910
Now once again, in this
function OK, in this f--

00:24:26.910 --> 00:24:28.420
you have to check
with the price.

00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:30.780
So even if profits
are negative you're

00:24:30.780 --> 00:24:32.850
still going to have to
check if price is greater

00:24:32.850 --> 00:24:34.017
than average variable costs.

00:24:34.017 --> 00:24:37.558
Now here at 6 units, the
average variable cost is 6.

00:24:37.558 --> 00:24:39.600
You see-- we could see--
you see the dashed line.

00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:41.912
If we sell 6 units, the
average variable cost is 6.

00:24:41.912 --> 00:24:44.370
So clearly price is greater
than the average variable cost.

00:24:44.370 --> 00:24:46.200
You wouldn't shut down, you're
making positive profits,

00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:46.990
in fact.

00:24:46.990 --> 00:24:50.310
You're making profits of 60,
OK, so you wouldn't shut down.

00:24:50.310 --> 00:24:53.920
But you always do have to
check the shut down rule, OK?

00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:57.370
So that's how you do a
monopoly problem, OK?

00:24:57.370 --> 00:25:00.920
Just to go back, how you
do a monopoly problem,

00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:03.260
you'll be given
a cost function--

00:25:03.260 --> 00:25:05.270
you know what to do
those in your sleep--

00:25:05.270 --> 00:25:06.960
and a demand function.

00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:10.060
The demand function gets
turned into a marginal revenue

00:25:10.060 --> 00:25:12.790
function simply through
these couple of steps.

00:25:12.790 --> 00:25:16.190
So the demand function gives
you a marginal revenue function.

00:25:16.190 --> 00:25:18.560
If you have marginal revenue
and you have marginal cost,

00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:21.657
then you know how to solve
for optimal quantity.

00:25:21.657 --> 00:25:24.240
If you have optimal quantity and
you respect the demand curve,

00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:26.650
you know how to solve for price.

00:25:26.650 --> 00:25:32.200
Once you have a price, OK,
and an average cost curve

00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:35.230
you can both check the shutdown
rule and compute profits.

00:25:35.230 --> 00:25:39.310
Profits are simply the price
you get minus average costs.

00:25:39.310 --> 00:25:43.350
So we can compute the profit
and check the shutdown rule, OK?

00:25:43.350 --> 00:25:46.560
So the only thing we
did here that's new

00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:49.080
is this sort of interesting
quirk that we have,

00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:50.790
this new marginal
revenue function.

00:25:50.790 --> 00:25:53.123
Otherwise, it's the same sort
of analysis we did before.

00:25:55.470 --> 00:25:58.040
So this should be doable
with some practice.

00:25:58.040 --> 00:26:03.520
Now, the key-- a key concept
here that we need to think

00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:06.020
about, that comes to question,
you might have asked yourself

00:26:06.020 --> 00:26:07.160
at some point--

00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:09.650
you might have said,
well, if monopolists

00:26:09.650 --> 00:26:12.140
are the only firm in the
market, why don't they

00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:14.520
just charge whatever they want?

00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:15.692
Why do they have to--

00:26:15.692 --> 00:26:18.150
why are they sort of constrained
by the sort of mathematics

00:26:18.150 --> 00:26:19.650
we've done before?

00:26:19.650 --> 00:26:23.370
And to answer this, let's turn
to the concept of market power.

00:26:25.910 --> 00:26:28.280
The market power
of monopolists we

00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:32.270
will define as their ability
to charge price greater

00:26:32.270 --> 00:26:34.760
than marginal cost.

00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:37.060
Your ability to charge price
greater than margin cost

00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:38.180
is your market power.

00:26:38.180 --> 00:26:40.490
In other words, competitive
firms have no market power.

00:26:40.490 --> 00:26:41.907
They have to charge
a price that's

00:26:41.907 --> 00:26:43.260
the same as their marginal cost.

00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:45.890
And that's why
they make no money.

00:26:45.890 --> 00:26:49.180
Monopolists have
market power, OK?

00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:51.310
So now let's return
to the condition

00:26:51.310 --> 00:26:53.110
for profit maximization.

00:26:53.110 --> 00:26:55.180
We said that
marginal revenue can

00:26:55.180 --> 00:26:59.200
be rewritten as
price times 1 plus 1

00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:03.910
over the elasticity
of demand, right?

00:27:03.910 --> 00:27:06.145
That equals marginal cost.

00:27:09.250 --> 00:27:14.330
So we can rewrite this as
marginal cost over price

00:27:14.330 --> 00:27:20.110
equals 1 plus 1 over the
elasticity of demand.

00:27:20.110 --> 00:27:23.680
And this is the monopolist's
market power condition.

00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:25.400
So if we define the market--

00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:27.775
so we can define something
we call a markup.

00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:32.500
Casually we can call it
profits, but technically it's

00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:37.250
the markup, OK, as
the percentage markup

00:27:37.250 --> 00:27:40.640
a monopolist can
make as p minus MC

00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:45.810
over p, how much of the price
is actually a markup over cost?

00:27:45.810 --> 00:27:47.640
It's sort of an
intuitive concept.

00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:49.440
So basically, how
much of the money

00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:53.110
you get for the unit is a markup
as a share of the money you

00:27:53.110 --> 00:27:55.020
get?

00:27:55.020 --> 00:28:00.480
Then that is simply--
that is equal to minus 1

00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:03.590
over the elasticity of demand.

00:28:03.590 --> 00:28:07.810
So the monopolist markup is
equal to 1 over-- minus 1

00:28:07.810 --> 00:28:11.490
over the elasticity of demand.

00:28:11.490 --> 00:28:14.720
So if the elasticity of
demand is negative infinity,

00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:17.440
that is a perfectly
competitive market.

00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:19.510
Then the markup is what?

00:28:19.510 --> 00:28:22.140
0, just like a competitive firm.

00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:26.630
Competitive firms have
to charge marginal cost.

00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:29.630
But as demand gets
more inelastic

00:28:29.630 --> 00:28:32.960
the monopolist gains
power to mark up the price

00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:33.620
and make money.

00:28:36.150 --> 00:28:38.790
And this answers our
question of why monopolists

00:28:38.790 --> 00:28:40.320
aren't infinitely powerful.

00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:42.660
What is the limiting
factor of monopolists?

00:28:42.660 --> 00:28:45.400
It's not other firms
producing their good.

00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:47.150
What's the limiting
factor on monopolists?

00:28:47.150 --> 00:28:47.770
Yeah?

00:28:47.770 --> 00:28:50.187
AUDIENCE: How much more will
they compete with [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:50.187 --> 00:28:52.610
JONATHAN GRUBER: Yeah,
it's other products.

00:28:52.610 --> 00:28:56.515
So think about a
monopolist in insulin.

00:28:56.515 --> 00:28:57.890
They can charge
whatever the hell

00:28:57.890 --> 00:29:01.550
they want, right, because
basically there's nothing else

00:29:01.550 --> 00:29:02.637
to buy.

00:29:02.637 --> 00:29:04.220
Well, maybe multiple
insulin products,

00:29:04.220 --> 00:29:07.460
but imagine one
insulin product, OK?

00:29:07.460 --> 00:29:09.170
So nothing constrains
the monopolist.

00:29:09.170 --> 00:29:10.878
He should charge an
infinite price up to,

00:29:10.878 --> 00:29:13.820
like, what Congress
will put up with, OK?

00:29:13.820 --> 00:29:16.040
But if you think about
a monopolist in a good

00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:21.820
where there's a substitute-- so
if I'm the monopolist in gum,

00:29:21.820 --> 00:29:24.740
if I'm a gum-opolist,
OK, then I'm

00:29:24.740 --> 00:29:26.330
constrained by how
much people want

00:29:26.330 --> 00:29:30.140
to-- eventually people just
substitute the candy, OK?

00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:32.120
Anything-- so I'm
constrained not

00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:34.910
by competitors in my
market, but by the fact

00:29:34.910 --> 00:29:38.250
that consumers can
substitute to other goods.

00:29:38.250 --> 00:29:39.860
So what's the limit
on monopolists?

00:29:39.860 --> 00:29:42.830
Consumers, we're the
limit on monopolists.

00:29:42.830 --> 00:29:45.470
Our willingness to put up
with that good relative

00:29:45.470 --> 00:29:47.210
to other goods, i.e.

00:29:47.210 --> 00:29:50.300
Our elasticity of
demand, is the only thing

00:29:50.300 --> 00:29:54.300
limiting monopolists, OK?

00:29:54.300 --> 00:29:56.952
So basically, there is market
discipline to monopolists.

00:29:56.952 --> 00:29:58.910
Even though they're the
only provider of a good

00:29:58.910 --> 00:30:01.040
they're still subject
to market discipline.

00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:04.010
It's just the discipline
doesn't come from other firms,

00:30:04.010 --> 00:30:08.360
it comes from consumers, OK?

00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:11.150
So a great example of
this is let's look,

00:30:11.150 --> 00:30:15.350
if you go on-- at least as of
last year, if you go on Amazon

00:30:15.350 --> 00:30:19.250
and look at the
prices of two goods

00:30:19.250 --> 00:30:21.230
that you've probably
had to consume

00:30:21.230 --> 00:30:25.580
in high school, Huckleberry
Finn and Great Gatsby, two books

00:30:25.580 --> 00:30:27.600
that many of you had to
consume in high school.

00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:28.975
You had to read
Huckleberry Finn,

00:30:28.975 --> 00:30:30.890
you had to read Great Gatsby.

00:30:30.890 --> 00:30:32.600
They're both
comparable lengths--

00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:33.920
Great Gatsby is a
little shorter I think,

00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:35.120
but they're both
comparable lengths.

00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:36.920
The production cost--
the marginal cost

00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:39.740
to produce them is probably
pretty comparable, OK?

00:30:39.740 --> 00:30:41.750
But if you go on
Amazon, Huck Finn

00:30:41.750 --> 00:30:44.735
costs $4 and the Great
Gatsby costs $16.

00:30:47.340 --> 00:30:49.400
Now why is this?

00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:50.720
Why is this, anyone know?

00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:53.110
Why does Great Gatsby
cost four times as much?

00:30:53.110 --> 00:30:55.640
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] it
was banned [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:57.140
JONATHAN GRUBER:
That's interesting.

00:30:57.140 --> 00:30:58.380
That's not enough to explain.

00:30:58.380 --> 00:30:59.360
It's not banned
in enough places,

00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:00.860
fortunately, to explain that.

00:31:00.860 --> 00:31:03.540
What else is going
on, anyone know?

00:31:03.540 --> 00:31:05.648
Yeah, in the red shirt, yeah?

00:31:05.648 --> 00:31:07.690
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
competitive-- it has, like,

00:31:07.690 --> 00:31:09.148
has no copyright infringement.

00:31:09.148 --> 00:31:10.190
JONATHAN GRUBER: Exactly.

00:31:10.190 --> 00:31:13.370
The Great Gatsby still
has copyright protection.

00:31:13.370 --> 00:31:16.940
That is, only people who get
permission from the great--

00:31:16.940 --> 00:31:21.370
from William Scott
Fitzgerald's descendants--

00:31:21.370 --> 00:31:26.290
F. Scott Fitzgerald, I'm sorry,
descendents get to produce it.

00:31:26.290 --> 00:31:31.260
They have a monopoly on the
good that is The Great Gatsby.

00:31:31.260 --> 00:31:36.150
Huck Finn, it turns out that 75
years after an author's death

00:31:36.150 --> 00:31:38.940
copyright protection expires.

00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:41.640
F. Scott Fitzgerald hasn't
been dead for 75 years,

00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:43.250
Mark Twain has.

00:31:43.250 --> 00:31:45.300
So Huck Finn can now
be produced by anyone.

00:31:45.300 --> 00:31:47.592
You can go out tomorrow and
produce a copy of Huck Finn

00:31:47.592 --> 00:31:49.190
and sell it.

00:31:49.190 --> 00:31:52.190
So we think probably Huck
Finn should be produced

00:31:52.190 --> 00:31:54.500
in a pretty competitive market.

00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:56.450
That is, basically
the $4 you pay

00:31:56.450 --> 00:31:58.992
for Huck Finn should be roughly
the cost of producing a book.

00:31:58.992 --> 00:32:00.742
OK, now no market's
perfectly competitive,

00:32:00.742 --> 00:32:02.300
a little markup but not much.

00:32:02.300 --> 00:32:06.070
Whereas The Great Gatsby, it's
not limited by competition.

00:32:06.070 --> 00:32:07.820
But it is limited by
the fact that if they

00:32:07.820 --> 00:32:09.920
try to charge $500
for Great Gatsby

00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:12.830
teachers would assign
something else, OK?

00:32:12.830 --> 00:32:13.790
There's still a limit.

00:32:13.790 --> 00:32:16.100
It's only $16, that's
not a whole lot for one

00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:18.770
of the great works
of literature, OK?

00:32:18.770 --> 00:32:19.670
It's still only $16.

00:32:19.670 --> 00:32:21.200
So why is it only $16?

00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:22.783
Because it's limited
by the fact there

00:32:22.783 --> 00:32:25.490
are other great works of
literature people can turn to.

00:32:25.490 --> 00:32:27.660
So Huck Finn is limited
by the competition

00:32:27.660 --> 00:32:30.030
within the market for the--

00:32:30.030 --> 00:32:32.170
across producers producing
some homogeneous good.

00:32:32.170 --> 00:32:34.260
It's probably a pretty close to
the competitive market, right?

00:32:34.260 --> 00:32:36.910
It's pretty easy to just set up
a shop and produce Huck Finn,

00:32:36.910 --> 00:32:39.432
whereas The Great Gatsby
has this extra effect which

00:32:39.432 --> 00:32:40.890
is copyright
protected, so its only

00:32:40.890 --> 00:32:42.830
limited by the
elasticity of demand.

00:32:42.830 --> 00:32:44.742
Yeah?

00:32:44.742 --> 00:32:47.080
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] be
like, [INAUDIBLE] like,

00:32:47.080 --> 00:32:49.580
the effect of, like, when you
increase price again, and even

00:32:49.580 --> 00:32:51.910
more with piracy, in a sense?

00:32:51.910 --> 00:32:54.510
Like, if, like, when you have,
like, a really, like, expensive

00:32:54.510 --> 00:32:56.820
good it leaves, like,
more incentive to steal?

00:32:56.820 --> 00:32:57.640
JONATHAN GRUBER:
That's a great point.

00:32:57.640 --> 00:32:58.620
So the elasticity
of demand, I should

00:32:58.620 --> 00:33:00.360
say the elasticity of
demand for that good,

00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:02.860
where one of the substitutes
could be an illegal substitute.

00:33:02.860 --> 00:33:04.280
That's a good point.

00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:06.960
OK, so let's go on and
talk about the next topic

00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:10.803
I want to cover today, which
is how do we-- because now we

00:33:10.803 --> 00:33:12.720
have a new set of tools
we've developed that's

00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:15.600
really cool which lets
us ask the question,

00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:19.380
not just what do monopolies do,
but how do we feel about it?

00:33:19.380 --> 00:33:22.350
That is, we can now turn to
talking about the welfare

00:33:22.350 --> 00:33:24.860
effects of monopoly.

00:33:24.860 --> 00:33:26.570
What are the welfare
effects of monopoly?

00:33:26.570 --> 00:33:30.260
How do we feel about monopoly?

00:33:30.260 --> 00:33:32.760
Well, let's start with
the standard case,

00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:34.760
that is the case we've
covered so far as opposed

00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:38.000
to a case I'll cover
in a minute, OK?

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:42.230
And let's look at
figure 11-5, which

00:33:42.230 --> 00:33:47.450
is the example we just solved
for, the example where demand

00:33:47.450 --> 00:33:53.420
equals 24 minus Q and
cost is 12 plus Q squared.

00:33:53.420 --> 00:33:54.980
So here we sh--

00:33:54.980 --> 00:33:56.210
once again what do we do?

00:33:56.210 --> 00:33:58.980
We set marginal cost
equal to marginal revenue.

00:33:58.980 --> 00:34:01.070
So they sell 6 units.

00:34:01.070 --> 00:34:03.620
We then say, what price
permits them to sell 6 units?

00:34:03.620 --> 00:34:05.360
The price of 18.

00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:08.060
So the equilibrium
is at a price of--

00:34:08.060 --> 00:34:12.500
is that e little m,
little m for monopoly, OK?

00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:17.350
They sell 6 units
at a price of 18.

00:34:17.350 --> 00:34:20.620
Well at that equilibrium,
what's consumer surplus?

00:34:20.620 --> 00:34:25.300
It's A, the area under the
demand curve, above the price.

00:34:25.300 --> 00:34:30.400
So consumer surplus is area
A. What's producer surplus?

00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:35.949
It's B plus D, the area below
the price above the supply

00:34:35.949 --> 00:34:37.870
curve, but only for the
units that are sold.

00:34:40.389 --> 00:34:46.929
So the consumer gets A, the
producer gets B plus D, OK?

00:34:46.929 --> 00:34:51.940
But C plus E is
not our units that

00:34:51.940 --> 00:34:55.179
are not sold for which
the marginal-- for which

00:34:55.179 --> 00:34:59.040
the willingness to pay is above
the willingness to supply.

00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:01.122
And what do we call those units?

00:35:01.122 --> 00:35:03.205
Units that are not sold--
someone raise their hand

00:35:03.205 --> 00:35:03.880
and tell me--

00:35:03.880 --> 00:35:06.213
units that are not sold for
which the willingness to pay

00:35:06.213 --> 00:35:08.220
is above the
willingness to supply?

00:35:08.220 --> 00:35:09.050
Yeah?

00:35:09.050 --> 00:35:09.390
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:09.390 --> 00:35:10.307
JONATHAN GRUBER: Loss.

00:35:10.307 --> 00:35:12.670
Those are units,
that's an inefficiency.

00:35:12.670 --> 00:35:17.560
Those units that are not sold
that efficiently should be.

00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:19.180
That is, we've broken--

00:35:19.180 --> 00:35:20.720
this our first example ever.

00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:23.620
This is a super exciting
moment of breaking

00:35:23.620 --> 00:35:25.928
the first fundamental
theorem of welfare economics.

00:35:25.928 --> 00:35:27.970
The first fundamental
theory of welfare economics

00:35:27.970 --> 00:35:32.800
was that the equilibrium,
the competitive equilibrium

00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:34.150
maximizes welfare.

00:35:34.150 --> 00:35:35.980
Well, that's no longer true.

00:35:35.980 --> 00:35:40.410
Here we have an equilibrium
that comes out of competition.

00:35:40.410 --> 00:35:43.830
It's what the market
delivers, but it

00:35:43.830 --> 00:35:45.487
doesn't maximize welfare.

00:35:45.487 --> 00:35:47.070
There's a dead weight
loss, and that's

00:35:47.070 --> 00:35:49.100
because the market's
imperfectly competitive.

00:35:49.100 --> 00:35:51.060
This is our first
ever example of what

00:35:51.060 --> 00:35:54.980
we call a market failure.

00:35:58.658 --> 00:36:00.200
And that's what,
from my perspective,

00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:01.735
makes economics fun.

00:36:01.735 --> 00:36:03.110
If there were no
market failures,

00:36:03.110 --> 00:36:05.690
if all markets functioned the
way we said they function, then

00:36:05.690 --> 00:36:08.065
basically we could have been
largely done with the course

00:36:08.065 --> 00:36:09.613
by now.

00:36:09.613 --> 00:36:11.030
What makes this
all interesting is

00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:12.822
markets don't function
the way we said they

00:36:12.822 --> 00:36:14.600
function in that extreme case.

00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:17.840
And therefore, a
market failure is

00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:22.070
defined as a case where the
market equilibrium does not

00:36:22.070 --> 00:36:24.510
maximize social welfare.

00:36:24.510 --> 00:36:26.780
So whenever the
market equilibrium

00:36:26.780 --> 00:36:29.300
does not maximize
social welfare,

00:36:29.300 --> 00:36:31.960
you've got a market failure.

00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:33.788
In the perfectly
competitive case

00:36:33.788 --> 00:36:36.080
we didn't have a failure
because the market equilibrium

00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:37.480
maximized welfare.

00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:39.130
That's not true here.

00:36:39.130 --> 00:36:42.370
Now the market equilibrium
does not maximize welfare.

00:36:42.370 --> 00:36:44.680
Therefore, it's
a market failure.

00:36:44.680 --> 00:36:46.480
Hint, what's exciting
about that to me

00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:49.235
is that means there might be a
potential role for policy, OK?

00:36:49.235 --> 00:36:50.860
So far in this course,
the government's

00:36:50.860 --> 00:36:51.740
just been a bad guy.

00:36:51.740 --> 00:36:53.990
Its done nothing but set
mean minimum wages and things

00:36:53.990 --> 00:36:56.020
like that, and terrible
price ceilings.

00:36:56.020 --> 00:36:57.520
But in fact, as
we'll see next time,

00:36:57.520 --> 00:36:59.687
this starts to introduce
the role for the government

00:36:59.687 --> 00:37:01.180
as a good guy, OK?

00:37:01.180 --> 00:37:04.500
Now, what makes-- to
drive this situation home,

00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:08.730
make this more interesting,
let's contrast that to the more

00:37:08.730 --> 00:37:12.180
realistic case of
price discrimination,

00:37:12.180 --> 00:37:15.900
or potentially more realistic
case of price discrimination.

00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:19.560
Now what happens if we
don't force the monopolist

00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:21.780
to only charge one price?

00:37:21.780 --> 00:37:25.530
What if we allow the monopolist
to charge different prices

00:37:25.530 --> 00:37:28.880
to different consumers?

00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:30.440
Here's a cool
conclusion actually,

00:37:30.440 --> 00:37:32.620
kind of crazy conclusion.

00:37:32.620 --> 00:37:36.468
If monopolists can perfectly
price discriminate,

00:37:36.468 --> 00:37:38.260
that is that they can
sell a separate price

00:37:38.260 --> 00:37:43.710
for every consumer, then
monopoly is welfare maximizing.

00:37:43.710 --> 00:37:46.270
If monopolists can set a perfect
price for every consumer,

00:37:46.270 --> 00:37:49.580
then monopoly does
maximize social welfare.

00:37:49.580 --> 00:37:51.680
To see that, simply
look at figure 11-6.

00:37:55.690 --> 00:37:59.980
Now let's take a perfectly
price discriminating monopolist.

00:37:59.980 --> 00:38:03.190
Let's think about what--
this prices they've set.

00:38:03.190 --> 00:38:08.115
Well, essentially what they're
going to do is set price where?

00:38:08.115 --> 00:38:09.490
A price discriminating
monopolist

00:38:09.490 --> 00:38:13.000
is going to set the price
for each unit to what?

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:13.845
Yeah?

00:38:13.845 --> 00:38:14.720
AUDIENCE: The demand.

00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:16.580
JONATHAN GRUBER: The demand,
the willingness to pay.

00:38:16.580 --> 00:38:18.320
If you're perfectly
price discriminating,

00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:20.840
you will screw
consumers to the max.

00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:22.010
And how do you do that?

00:38:22.010 --> 00:38:25.870
By delivering them no surplus.

00:38:25.870 --> 00:38:28.040
By taking all the
surplus for yourself.

00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:31.450
So for the first
unit, you charge 5.

00:38:31.450 --> 00:38:33.010
For the second
unit, you charge 4.

00:38:33.010 --> 00:38:36.240
And for the sixth
unit you charge 18.

00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:39.660
Now, the [INAUDIBLE]---- now the
previous monopolist stopped

00:38:39.660 --> 00:38:40.620
at 6.

00:38:40.620 --> 00:38:42.000
Why do he stop at 6?

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:45.240
Because the sale of the seventh
unit would have lost him money.

00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:47.670
He would've had to lower the
price on all previous units.

00:38:47.670 --> 00:38:49.170
But the price
[INAUDIBLE] monopolist

00:38:49.170 --> 00:38:51.060
has no poisoning
effect because he

00:38:51.060 --> 00:38:53.880
doesn't have to lower the
price on the previous units.

00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:55.650
He can say for
that seventh unit,

00:38:55.650 --> 00:38:59.325
I'm going to sell
that one at 17.

00:38:59.325 --> 00:39:00.700
I'm going to make
17, and I'm not

00:39:00.700 --> 00:39:02.242
going to lose any
money because I can

00:39:02.242 --> 00:39:04.410
keep the other prices the same.

00:39:04.410 --> 00:39:06.580
So with a perfectly price
discriminating monopolist,

00:39:06.580 --> 00:39:08.000
you get rid of the
poisoning effect.

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:10.200
They can just march their
way down the demand curve,

00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:13.110
charging every consumer exactly
their willingness to pay.

00:39:13.110 --> 00:39:15.390
Therefore, they will
continue to produce

00:39:15.390 --> 00:39:17.400
until the competitive
equilibrium.

00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:19.650
They will continue to produce
until willingness to pay

00:39:19.650 --> 00:39:21.150
equals willingness to supply.

00:39:21.150 --> 00:39:23.500
But they will capture
all the surplus.

00:39:23.500 --> 00:39:25.830
So the new equilibrium
will be EC,

00:39:25.830 --> 00:39:29.070
the competitive equilibrium,
but the entire surplus

00:39:29.070 --> 00:39:31.870
goes to the monopolist.

00:39:31.870 --> 00:39:33.940
So the fascinating
case, there's--

00:39:33.940 --> 00:39:36.910
we maximize social welfare,
but only because we

00:39:36.910 --> 00:39:39.070
define social welfare
in this particular way,

00:39:39.070 --> 00:39:42.700
which is the simple sum of
consumer producer surplus.

00:39:42.700 --> 00:39:44.920
Here, producers get
all the surplus,

00:39:44.920 --> 00:39:47.790
therefore welfare is maximized.

00:39:47.790 --> 00:39:50.580
So a perfectly price
discriminating monopolist,

00:39:50.580 --> 00:39:55.650
OK, gets maximized
social welfare, OK?

00:39:55.650 --> 00:39:58.530
Now, there's two interesting
points to come out of this.

00:39:58.530 --> 00:40:01.980
Point one is this is a
cool way to understand

00:40:01.980 --> 00:40:05.557
why there's a dead
weight loss for monopoly.

00:40:05.557 --> 00:40:07.390
It's cool to understand
because you can see-

00:40:07.390 --> 00:40:10.015
you can focus on that point
E sub M and think about why

00:40:10.015 --> 00:40:12.640
the perfectly price [INAUDIBLE]
monopolist gets to sell another

00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:14.650
unit and the regular
monopolist doesn't.

00:40:14.650 --> 00:40:17.258
Because the regular monopolist
has the poising effect

00:40:17.258 --> 00:40:19.300
and the perfectly price
discriminating monopolist

00:40:19.300 --> 00:40:19.972
does not.

00:40:19.972 --> 00:40:21.430
So it's a good way
to sort of think

00:40:21.430 --> 00:40:24.210
about that intuition of
the poisoning effect.

00:40:24.210 --> 00:40:26.430
That's lesson one.

00:40:26.430 --> 00:40:29.748
Lesson two is, gee, we may
want to talk about definition

00:40:29.748 --> 00:40:32.040
of welfare that's not just
the sum of consumer producer

00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:33.920
surplus.

00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:36.720
A model of welfare that delivers
the fact that a producer that

00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:39.360
can screw every single consumer
out of any of their surplus

00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:41.430
is the best possible
outcome might not

00:40:41.430 --> 00:40:44.460
be a model we're
so happy with, OK?

00:40:44.460 --> 00:40:46.140
But that we can come back to.

00:40:46.140 --> 00:40:48.350
But for now it's a nice extreme.

00:40:48.350 --> 00:40:51.060
And in fact, in reality
no firm is perfectly

00:40:51.060 --> 00:40:53.320
price discriminating, OK?

00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:55.022
Amazon tried to be.

00:40:55.022 --> 00:40:56.730
There was a controversy
a number of years

00:40:56.730 --> 00:41:00.810
ago where Amazon would set
your price according to your--

00:41:00.810 --> 00:41:03.930
what's the little, the string
of numbers address, IP address.

00:41:03.930 --> 00:41:07.590
They literally would set
prices by IP address.

00:41:07.590 --> 00:41:09.330
They'd literally
say, well you know,

00:41:09.330 --> 00:41:12.060
you're coming from an IP address
that's, for example, you're

00:41:12.060 --> 00:41:13.192
in a high-high income area.

00:41:13.192 --> 00:41:14.400
I'm going to charge you more.

00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:15.720
You're in a
university, therefore

00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:17.053
you need this book for a course.

00:41:17.053 --> 00:41:19.620
Therefore, I'm going to
charge you more, et cetera.

00:41:19.620 --> 00:41:22.890
That, they got busted and
that was found illegal.

00:41:22.890 --> 00:41:25.650
But just because you can't
perfectly price discriminate

00:41:25.650 --> 00:41:30.000
doesn't mean we don't have lots
of examples of partial price

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:30.700
discrimination.

00:41:30.700 --> 00:41:33.325
So what are examples in the real
world of price discrimination?

00:41:33.325 --> 00:41:34.680
What do firms do?

00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:37.240
And what's the general-- let
me ask, tell me what firms do.

00:41:37.240 --> 00:41:39.240
And also I wonder, what's
the general principle?

00:41:39.240 --> 00:41:41.273
What's the basic
idea that firms--

00:41:41.273 --> 00:41:42.690
if you want to
price discriminate,

00:41:42.690 --> 00:41:44.567
what do you want to figure out?

00:41:44.567 --> 00:41:45.900
What is your goal to figure out?

00:41:45.900 --> 00:41:46.650
Yeah.

00:41:46.650 --> 00:41:48.880
AUDIENCE: Isn't
[INAUDIBLE] make airplanes?

00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:49.755
JONATHAN GRUBER:
[INAUDIBLE] the what?

00:41:49.755 --> 00:41:50.190
AUDIENCE: Airplanes.

00:41:50.190 --> 00:41:50.640
JONATHAN GRUBER: Airplanes.

00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:51.303
So explain.

00:41:51.303 --> 00:41:52.720
AUDIENCE: Because
if know somebody

00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:54.510
is buying a ticket, like,
two days before a flight,

00:41:54.510 --> 00:41:55.386
it's probably for
a business trip

00:41:55.386 --> 00:41:57.130
so they can pay
a lot more money.

00:41:57.130 --> 00:41:59.630
JONATHAN GRUBER: And why are
they willing to pay more money?

00:41:59.630 --> 00:42:02.670
AUDIENCE: Um, because
the elasticity is--

00:42:02.670 --> 00:42:05.700
JONATHAN GRUBER: The
elasticity is low because?

00:42:05.700 --> 00:42:07.375
AUDIENCE: Because
they have to do it.

00:42:07.375 --> 00:42:08.750
JONATHAN GRUBER:
They have to go.

00:42:08.750 --> 00:42:11.640
If you're going to buy two
days before, you got to go.

00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:13.613
If you're buying six
months before, you know,

00:42:13.613 --> 00:42:15.030
you might have to
go that day, you

00:42:15.030 --> 00:42:16.280
might not have to go that day.

00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:18.720
You might have to-- but if
you're buying last minute,

00:42:18.720 --> 00:42:22.280
you've got to go so
your elasticity's lower.

00:42:22.280 --> 00:42:24.860
So price discriminating
monopolists

00:42:24.860 --> 00:42:27.950
look for signals of elasticity.

00:42:27.950 --> 00:42:29.570
That's their search.

00:42:29.570 --> 00:42:32.030
They can't literally know
your willingness to pay.

00:42:32.030 --> 00:42:34.280
Amazon tried, but even
Amazon couldn't perfectly

00:42:34.280 --> 00:42:35.790
know your willingness to pay.

00:42:35.790 --> 00:42:39.200
So they're looking for
signals that are correlated

00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:40.700
with your willingness to pay.

00:42:40.700 --> 00:42:44.098
One signal is whether you want
to fly at the last minute.

00:42:44.098 --> 00:42:45.640
That means you have
a low elasticity.

00:42:45.640 --> 00:42:47.015
You're screwed,
you've got to go.

00:42:47.015 --> 00:42:48.910
What's another
thing airlines do?

00:42:48.910 --> 00:42:52.910
What's another signal of
elasticity the airlines use?

00:42:52.910 --> 00:42:53.990
How else-- yeah.

00:42:53.990 --> 00:42:56.600
AUDIENCE: How long have
you been on the website?

00:42:56.600 --> 00:42:57.080
JONATHAN GRUBER: They don't--

00:42:57.080 --> 00:42:58.640
I don't know if they actually
use that, how long you

00:42:58.640 --> 00:42:59.240
been on the website.

00:42:59.240 --> 00:43:00.700
They could, that would
be kind of interesting.

00:43:00.700 --> 00:43:01.840
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:02.950
JONATHAN GRUBER:
Yeah, I don't know.

00:43:02.950 --> 00:43:04.280
But that, that's pretty subtle.

00:43:04.280 --> 00:43:08.050
What's a more blunt one they
used even before websites?

00:43:08.050 --> 00:43:08.680
Yeah?

00:43:08.680 --> 00:43:09.730
AUDIENCE: Search history?

00:43:09.730 --> 00:43:11.290
JONATHAN GRUBER: No,
even before search--

00:43:11.290 --> 00:43:12.370
I know you guys grew
up with internet

00:43:12.370 --> 00:43:14.070
but there was life
before the internet.

00:43:14.070 --> 00:43:16.090
And even before the internet,
airlines price discriminated.

00:43:16.090 --> 00:43:17.110
What did they--
what did they do?

00:43:17.110 --> 00:43:17.860
In the back, yeah.

00:43:17.860 --> 00:43:19.060
AUDIENCE: You have, like
business class and--

00:43:19.060 --> 00:43:21.435
JONATHAN GRUBER: Yeah, different
levels of flight, right?

00:43:21.435 --> 00:43:24.130
Why is a first class ticket
more than a coach ticket?

00:43:24.130 --> 00:43:27.998
Because rich guys are less
elastic than poor guys.

00:43:27.998 --> 00:43:30.040
So basically, another way
of price discriminating

00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:33.730
within the same flight is
by having different quality.

00:43:33.730 --> 00:43:35.590
So what they do
is they say, we're

00:43:35.590 --> 00:43:37.390
going to give you a
higher quality product,

00:43:37.390 --> 00:43:41.120
but look, first class business--
so I flew business class

00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:42.370
for the first time in my life.

00:43:42.370 --> 00:43:42.880
I was very exciting.

00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:44.505
I went to India, I
flew business class.

00:43:44.505 --> 00:43:45.940
It was awesome.

00:43:45.940 --> 00:43:49.730
But it raised the price of the
ticket from $1,000 to $2,500.

00:43:49.730 --> 00:43:54.530
Now, it was better but
it wasn't $1,500 better.

00:43:54.530 --> 00:43:56.870
Or [INAUDIBLE] put this,
let me rephrase that.

00:43:56.870 --> 00:43:59.790
It cost more, but it's certainly
didn't cost $1,500 more.

00:43:59.790 --> 00:44:01.210
I got a bigger
seat, and like, you

00:44:01.210 --> 00:44:02.750
know, people slaved over me.

00:44:02.750 --> 00:44:05.620
But like, it certainly
did not cost them $1,500

00:44:05.620 --> 00:44:06.620
to provide that service.

00:44:06.620 --> 00:44:09.830
They clearly made more of a
markup on the business class

00:44:09.830 --> 00:44:12.350
seat than they did
in the coach seat

00:44:12.350 --> 00:44:13.620
because I was less elastic.

00:44:13.620 --> 00:44:14.120
Why?

00:44:14.120 --> 00:44:16.200
Because someone else was
paying for my flight,

00:44:16.200 --> 00:44:17.360
OK, so as less elastic.

00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:19.763
And that's-- if you talk to
people in business class,

00:44:19.763 --> 00:44:21.680
none of them are paying
for their own flights.

00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:24.822
They're either super rich or
their company's paying, OK?

00:44:24.822 --> 00:44:26.780
So the bottom line, that's
another way airlines

00:44:26.780 --> 00:44:27.100
[INAUDIBLE].

00:44:27.100 --> 00:44:28.030
Let's get away from airlines.

00:44:28.030 --> 00:44:29.710
What are other examples
of price discrimination?

00:44:29.710 --> 00:44:30.347
Yeah.

00:44:30.347 --> 00:44:32.430
AUDIENCE: Isn't that a
common thing, like, Google,

00:44:32.430 --> 00:44:34.460
like, [INAUDIBLE] actually
use your search history

00:44:34.460 --> 00:44:36.110
and cookies to, like, figure
out how much money you make

00:44:36.110 --> 00:44:38.230
and how much you're willing
to spend on certain items?

00:44:38.230 --> 00:44:39.250
JONATHAN GRUBER: I think--

00:44:39.250 --> 00:44:40.208
I have to look this up.

00:44:40.208 --> 00:44:42.100
I think they're not
allowed to do that.

00:44:42.100 --> 00:44:44.760
They're allowed to do that
in targeting advertising,

00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:47.135
but I don't know if they're
allowed to setting the price.

00:44:47.135 --> 00:44:48.593
I don't know if a
company's allowed

00:44:48.593 --> 00:44:50.200
to that setting the price.

00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:51.860
Yeah?

00:44:51.860 --> 00:44:56.180
AUDIENCE: Sometimes chains will
be more expensive in cities

00:44:56.180 --> 00:44:57.870
and less expensive
in rural areas.

00:44:57.870 --> 00:44:59.440
Like, the same meal
at McDonald's can

00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:01.023
cost a different
amount depending on--

00:45:01.023 --> 00:45:02.300
JONATHAN GRUBER: Exactly, or--

00:45:02.300 --> 00:45:03.320
that's exactly right.

00:45:03.320 --> 00:45:05.910
Restaurants or supermarkets.

00:45:05.910 --> 00:45:10.760
Now here's what's interesting,
if you look at a McDonald's,

00:45:10.760 --> 00:45:12.880
OK, its prices--

00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:14.450
no, it's true for both.

00:45:14.450 --> 00:45:17.270
Basically, if you look
like, like if I buy--

00:45:17.270 --> 00:45:21.220
when I buy McDonald's on the
highway out in the suburbs

00:45:21.220 --> 00:45:24.140
it's more expensive than I
would buy here in Cambridge.

00:45:24.140 --> 00:45:25.610
Why is that?

00:45:25.610 --> 00:45:27.768
Why is-- why is a big so-- yeah?

00:45:27.768 --> 00:45:29.310
AUDIENCE: Not a lot
of other options.

00:45:29.310 --> 00:45:29.670
JONATHAN GRUBER: Yeah.

00:45:29.670 --> 00:45:30.570
I'm like, I'm driving.

00:45:30.570 --> 00:45:31.210
Where am I going to go?

00:45:31.210 --> 00:45:33.630
I can't say, oh, it's too
expensive, I'm going next door.

00:45:33.630 --> 00:45:34.770
So that's an example.

00:45:34.770 --> 00:45:39.150
Inner city price-- supermarkets
charge much higher prices

00:45:39.150 --> 00:45:41.940
in the city than
out of the city.

00:45:41.940 --> 00:45:44.348
Now you might think that's
sort of strange, OK?

00:45:44.348 --> 00:45:45.890
But that's because
in the city people

00:45:45.890 --> 00:45:46.670
have to walk to get there.

00:45:46.670 --> 00:45:47.650
They don't have
a lot of options.

00:45:47.650 --> 00:45:48.900
There's not a lot of shopping.

00:45:48.900 --> 00:45:51.980
Outside, they can drive from
supermarket to supermarket, OK?

00:45:51.980 --> 00:45:55.100
So there's all these complicated
things that go into it.

00:45:55.100 --> 00:45:57.470
One of my-- let me
sort of tell you

00:45:57.470 --> 00:45:59.340
a couple of my
favorite examples.

00:45:59.340 --> 00:46:02.325
One of my favorite examples
is early bird specials.

00:46:02.325 --> 00:46:03.950
Now you guys might
not know about this,

00:46:03.950 --> 00:46:05.950
but you might've hung out
with your grandparents

00:46:05.950 --> 00:46:08.270
and known that, like, if
you go to a restaurant

00:46:08.270 --> 00:46:11.660
sometimes before 5 o'clock
or 5:30, it's cheaper.

00:46:11.660 --> 00:46:15.820
Or if you go to a matinee
movie, a movie during the day

00:46:15.820 --> 00:46:18.030
is cheaper than
a movie at night.

00:46:18.030 --> 00:46:19.900
Same movie, why?

00:46:19.900 --> 00:46:22.400
Why is a movie during the day
cheaper than a movie at night?

00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:25.968
Yeah.

00:46:25.968 --> 00:46:27.426
AUDIENCE: Because
in the night time

00:46:27.426 --> 00:46:28.920
you probably want
to go to the movies

00:46:28.920 --> 00:46:31.212
more because you're off work
and you have things to do.

00:46:31.212 --> 00:46:32.960
And so there's like--

00:46:32.960 --> 00:46:34.880
like, if you went
early you're purposely

00:46:34.880 --> 00:46:36.350
looking for a cheaper option.

00:46:36.350 --> 00:46:37.440
So you [INAUDIBLE].

00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:38.900
JONATHAN GRUBER: You're
more elastic during the day

00:46:38.900 --> 00:46:40.610
because basically you're
an old retired person's

00:46:40.610 --> 00:46:42.410
who's got nothing but
time in their hands.

00:46:42.410 --> 00:46:44.327
It's like, you can shop
around movie theaters,

00:46:44.327 --> 00:46:47.600
you decide to go to movie
or take a nap, et cetera.

00:46:47.600 --> 00:46:49.400
Same thing with early
dinner specials.

00:46:49.400 --> 00:46:52.070
People who have more time
to shop are more elastic.

00:46:52.070 --> 00:46:53.940
At night you're going
out to see the movie.

00:46:53.940 --> 00:46:55.275
These are people, you know--

00:46:55.275 --> 00:46:56.900
in some sense it's
sort of interesting.

00:46:56.900 --> 00:46:57.810
You think midnight movies--

00:46:57.810 --> 00:46:59.600
I don't know if this is
true, midnight movies

00:46:59.600 --> 00:47:00.830
should charge and most of all.

00:47:00.830 --> 00:47:02.570
Because that's a bunch of
insane fans, right, who

00:47:02.570 --> 00:47:03.743
have to see the movie first.

00:47:03.743 --> 00:47:06.160
It seems like the midnight
showing should charge the most.

00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:06.780
I don't know if that's true.

00:47:06.780 --> 00:47:08.550
That would be
interesting to look at.

00:47:08.550 --> 00:47:09.990
OK, that's one example.

00:47:09.990 --> 00:47:12.500
Another example I
love is Disneyland.

00:47:12.500 --> 00:47:15.320
Disneyland and Disney
World charge less

00:47:15.320 --> 00:47:18.770
if you live within 20
or so miles of the park.

00:47:18.770 --> 00:47:20.863
Why?

00:47:20.863 --> 00:47:22.030
Because you can go whenever.

00:47:22.030 --> 00:47:24.420
So when I took my kids to Disney
World, if I went up and said,

00:47:24.420 --> 00:47:26.378
I'm sorry kids, it was
$10 more than I thought,

00:47:26.378 --> 00:47:29.500
we're not going, I would
have had a riot on my hands.

00:47:29.500 --> 00:47:31.202
Once you're there,
you're inelastic.

00:47:31.202 --> 00:47:32.410
You're going to Disney World.

00:47:32.410 --> 00:47:33.993
There's nothing else
to do in Orlando.

00:47:33.993 --> 00:47:36.280
I mean, but there's
other parks, I guess.

00:47:36.280 --> 00:47:38.200
But like, but if you
live locally you can

00:47:38.200 --> 00:47:40.570
decide whether to go or not.

00:47:40.570 --> 00:47:43.450
And then probably the most
interesting recent example

00:47:43.450 --> 00:47:45.710
is Tesla.

00:47:45.710 --> 00:47:48.430
So during-- I feel like, did
I tell you guys the Tesla

00:47:48.430 --> 00:47:49.990
hurricane story yet?

00:47:49.990 --> 00:47:50.990
I don't think so, right?

00:47:50.990 --> 00:47:53.160
OK, so during the
hurricane in Florida--

00:47:53.160 --> 00:47:55.190
Irma, I guess it was?

00:47:55.190 --> 00:48:00.350
In Florida, Tesla-- so Tesla
so two cars, two models,

00:48:00.350 --> 00:48:03.350
the cheaper model and
the more expensive model.

00:48:03.350 --> 00:48:05.780
And the more expensive
model had some nice doodads,

00:48:05.780 --> 00:48:09.020
but most importantly the
battery lasted longer.

00:48:09.020 --> 00:48:11.060
The cheaper model
was like 300 miles,

00:48:11.060 --> 00:48:13.610
the more expensive model
was like 500 miles.

00:48:13.610 --> 00:48:19.460
During hurricane Irma, Tesla
as a gesture of goodwill said,

00:48:19.460 --> 00:48:21.740
hey guys who drive
the cheap car,

00:48:21.740 --> 00:48:23.720
you can now drive 500 miles.

00:48:23.720 --> 00:48:26.420
And they're like, what the
hell, it's the same battery?

00:48:26.420 --> 00:48:30.250
Tesla said, well it turns
out, it's the same battery.

00:48:30.250 --> 00:48:32.000
The only difference
is a piece of software

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:34.710
that we can turn off or on.

00:48:34.710 --> 00:48:36.920
So why did Tesla do that?

00:48:36.920 --> 00:48:41.810
Why did Tesla have a piece of
software they turn off or on

00:48:41.810 --> 00:48:45.230
and turn it off for some
people to make them drive less?

00:48:45.230 --> 00:48:46.660
Why did they do that?

00:48:46.660 --> 00:48:47.950
There's someone else involved.

00:48:47.950 --> 00:48:49.592
Can anyone tell me
about what Tesla

00:48:49.592 --> 00:48:51.800
thought, meaning besides
the, oh, must be an asshole.

00:48:51.800 --> 00:48:52.300
What else?

00:48:52.300 --> 00:48:53.930
What's the other--
what's the kind of--

00:48:53.930 --> 00:48:55.520
what's Tesla's thought process?

00:48:55.520 --> 00:48:58.270
Actually, it was
perfect economics.

00:48:58.270 --> 00:48:58.780
Yeah?

00:48:58.780 --> 00:48:59.300
AUDIENCE: Price discrimination.

00:48:59.300 --> 00:49:00.670
JONATHAN GRUBER: Right,
it's price discrimination.

00:49:00.670 --> 00:49:01.697
But how?

00:49:01.697 --> 00:49:04.030
How are you price discriminating
by making some people--

00:49:04.030 --> 00:49:05.170
yeah?

00:49:05.170 --> 00:49:09.018
AUDIENCE: You can make a
500 mile car more expensive.

00:49:09.018 --> 00:49:10.060
JONATHAN GRUBER: Exactly.

00:49:10.060 --> 00:49:11.743
It's like first class.

00:49:11.743 --> 00:49:13.660
You're basically saying,
I want to charge more

00:49:13.660 --> 00:49:15.112
for a better product.

00:49:15.112 --> 00:49:16.820
I can't charge more
for the same product,

00:49:16.820 --> 00:49:19.840
so if I give everyone 500
miles I can't charge more.

00:49:19.840 --> 00:49:23.950
But by making one product
better I can separate demand.

00:49:23.950 --> 00:49:26.620
I can sell the expensive product
to the low elasticity of demand

00:49:26.620 --> 00:49:28.480
consumers and the less
expensive to the high

00:49:28.480 --> 00:49:29.470
elasticity of demand.

00:49:29.470 --> 00:49:33.370
But it's actually the same damn
product, I just did it as a way

00:49:33.370 --> 00:49:35.090
to price discriminate.

00:49:35.090 --> 00:49:37.930
So Tesla, in an
effort to be nice,

00:49:37.930 --> 00:49:40.760
screwed themselves by revealing
that they had been actually

00:49:40.760 --> 00:49:42.625
falsely screw-- you
know screwing consumers.

00:49:42.625 --> 00:49:44.500
It's not [INAUDIBLE]----
it's good economics.

00:49:44.500 --> 00:49:46.190
It makes total sense.

00:49:46.190 --> 00:49:48.950
OK, this actually
follows one last example.

00:49:48.950 --> 00:49:52.120
When the first laser
printers came out,

00:49:52.120 --> 00:49:54.320
OK, it turned out
that you could buy one

00:49:54.320 --> 00:49:57.740
for home that was like half
the price one for office.

00:49:57.740 --> 00:49:59.990
And someone took them apart
and found the one for home

00:49:59.990 --> 00:50:02.600
was the one for the office
plus an extra piece that

00:50:02.600 --> 00:50:03.500
made it go slower.

00:50:06.540 --> 00:50:08.113
And they did that
simply because they

00:50:08.113 --> 00:50:10.530
knew the office guys were less
price elastic than the home

00:50:10.530 --> 00:50:11.270
guys.

00:50:11.270 --> 00:50:12.810
So they wanted an expensive
one-- so they said,

00:50:12.810 --> 00:50:13.810
the office one's faster.

00:50:13.810 --> 00:50:14.580
Isn't this cool?

00:50:14.580 --> 00:50:16.955
It was faster because they
didn't add an extra piece that

00:50:16.955 --> 00:50:18.247
made to go slower, OK?

00:50:18.247 --> 00:50:19.330
And that's the same thing.

00:50:19.330 --> 00:50:21.512
So let's stop there,
and we'll come back

00:50:21.512 --> 00:50:22.470
and talk more monopoly.

00:50:22.470 --> 00:50:26.310
Good luck tomorrow night
and we'll talk more

00:50:26.310 --> 00:50:28.760
about monopoly on Wednesday.

00:00:21.118 --> 00:00:22.534
PROFESSOR: Our
guest speaker today

00:00:22.534 --> 00:00:25.390
from Morgan Stanley,
Ivan Masyukov.

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.336
Dr. Ivan Masyukov.

00:00:28.336 --> 00:00:29.210
IVAN MASYUKOV: Hello.

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:30.260
One, two, three.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:31.206
Can you hear me?

00:00:31.206 --> 00:00:34.280
PROFESSOR: And the microphone
will just be recording you,

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.940
but it doesn't broadcast you.

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:36.970
IVAN MASYUKOV: Ah.

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:37.470
Understood.

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:37.970
All right.

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.950
So I'm Ivan Masyukov.

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.540
I work in Morgan Stanley.

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:48.420
And my background is applied
physics and mathematics

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.970
from Moscow Institute of
Physics and Technology.

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:59.905
And today, the
topic of the lecture

00:00:59.905 --> 00:01:03.860
is regularized pricing
and risk models.

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.600
So we will talk about
typical pricing risk

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:13.430
models for interest
rate products,

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.400
and the important
aspect of adding

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.340
some additional
constraints, which means,

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.280
like, adding some
regularizers to the model.

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.020
So we will start
from bonds, which

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.200
is probably the most
simple interest rate

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.110
product on the market.

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.830
Then we will discuss swaps.

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.980
We will build a yield curve.

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:44.900
And we will see how
yield curve models

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:51.550
can be improved to satisfy
needs of actual trader.

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:55.220
And at the end, we'll look
at the very nice example

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.970
of ill-posed problem
of calibrating

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.050
the two-dimensional
volatility surface

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.690
necessary for volatility model--
Monte Carlo assimilation.

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:11.074
And we will see how that
problem can be solved.

00:02:11.074 --> 00:02:12.990
During the lecture, if
you have any questions,

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:14.800
please interrupt, OK?

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:19.960
So what is bond?

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:25.450
Bond is a security which
is issued if someone

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.200
like a borrower needs money.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:32.400
And it promises to pay
some certain fixed amount

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.200
of certain cash
flows in the future,

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.590
and request for some
money up front for this.

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:47.170
So typical bonds basically
include same periodic payment--

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.720
let's say like every
half year or every year

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.190
until maturity, where at
maturity the face value is

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.540
paid, like the
biggest sum of money.

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.620
And again, during the
beginning, the investor

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.730
is asked to pay some up front.

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:08.780
There are also
zero-coupon bonds,

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.070
which don't pay anything
until the maturity.

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.800
And there are very
interesting perpetual bonds

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.620
where basically you pay
some money up front,

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.560
and then you pay it back
like infinitely-- which

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.340
sounds like a good
deal, but we will

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.200
know how to price it right.

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:34.730
So those are some diagrams.

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:38.740
So the first one is the
standard fixed-rate bond,

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:47.900
where small green arrows
represent a periodic payment.

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:51.700
And there is a face value added
on top of a periodic payment

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.210
at the maturity of the bond.

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:01.300
So this is a typical cash flow
diagram used for analysis, OK?

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:06.306
And so arrows up
represent something that--

00:04:06.306 --> 00:04:07.180
and it's green right?

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:08.013
That is good for us.

00:04:08.013 --> 00:04:10.470
So it's something
that we receive.

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:14.680
And a red arrow facing
down represents something

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.095
that you have to pay.

00:04:16.095 --> 00:04:16.750
Right?

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:25.110
So a zero coupon bond is
something, as I said before,

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.370
is something that
you pay up front,

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:34.250
and you get back a fixed
amount of money in the future.

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:36.500
What's interesting
about this graph-- you

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:41.630
can see that the green
arrow has a bigger

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:45.480
amplitude than the red one,
which means that you kind

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:50.620
of, every time you put
like $100 now, right,

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:52.482
you kind of expect
that in return you

00:04:52.482 --> 00:04:53.440
get more in the future.

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.340
Because if you don't
get more in the future,

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:57.509
you just don't get this
money, don't put this money.

00:04:57.509 --> 00:04:58.800
You just keep it in the pocket.

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:08.160
So as a result, you get the
concept of time value of money.

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:16.480
So tomorrow, $100 always
will be more than just $100.

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:21.980
And also, if you look at the
graph of the fixed-rate coupon

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:26.320
bond, and you sum all
of the cash flows here,

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:29.260
it looks like you get
more than this red one.

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:36.460
But again, there is, as
further in the future

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:41.170
the cash flow is, the more
the kind of depreciation.

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:44.930
And we call this depreciation
a discount factor, OK?

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:50.490
So basically the more
in the future the cash

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:53.980
flow is, the smaller
the discount factor.

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:55.550
And so for today
the discount factor

00:05:55.550 --> 00:06:00.440
will be 1, for tomorrow it will
be like 0.999, and so forth.

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:04.760
And in 30 years, let's say,
it will probably be like 0.1,

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:07.755
depending on current
rates in the market.

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:20.370
So let's see how we can
price the bond-- or not

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:25.440
necessarily price, but
compute a fair value

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:28.840
of future cash flows.

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:33.670
So our fair value of
computed cash flows

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:36.875
can be found if we
have discount factors.

00:06:36.875 --> 00:06:39.690
So every discount factor
at every cash flow

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:43.130
in the future I-- which
in this particular case

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:47.540
will be a coupon
times the face value--

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:49.930
should be multiplied
by the discount factor.

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:52.930
And then we also add
a face value discount

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:56.215
with a discount factor at the
maturity of the instrument.

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:06.085
So the way this product
trades in the market

00:07:06.085 --> 00:07:13.530
is that people buy and
sell bonds paying P, right?

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:17.300
So it's very important to
understand that for bonds, it's

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:20.530
not something that we have cash
flows which we kind of need

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:21.660
to price.

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:25.100
It's actually the
price is already known.

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:27.796
So it's very liquid.

00:07:27.796 --> 00:07:30.360
It's the result of
activity in the market,

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:32.860
meaning that there is
very little uncertainty

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:33.820
about the price.

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:36.810
So this P is known.

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:39.050
And as with all cash flows,
it's something that's

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:40.540
written in the contract, right?

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:45.480
So it's something, we have
fixed cash flows in the future.

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:50.000
So it's always a question
about what kind of model

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.910
is useful for the
discount factors.

00:07:54.910 --> 00:07:56.850
So we need a model
for discounting.

00:08:00.090 --> 00:08:01.150
Any questions so far?

00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:11.230
So one of the simplest models
is to use just one parameter

00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:16.470
to kind of cover
all the discounting.

00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:20.300
And the discount factor
can be represented

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:27.600
as e minus y times t
of i, t sub i, where

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:33.226
y is some kind of-- it's
called yield to maturity.

00:08:33.226 --> 00:08:34.809
Well, the reason why
it's exponential,

00:08:34.809 --> 00:08:36.270
it's natural right?

00:08:36.270 --> 00:08:42.916
So if you have a 0.999
discount factor for today,

00:08:42.916 --> 00:08:44.290
and then we kind
of say, OK, it's

00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:45.800
the same discount
for tomorrow, we

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:48.300
will have the same discounting
for every other day.

00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:49.590
So we have to multiply them.

00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:52.240
As a result, the
total discounting

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:56.140
will be an exponential.

00:08:56.140 --> 00:09:00.630
So if our discount
factors are like this,

00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:07.020
then our price basically
can be represented

00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:09.770
as a linear combination of
future cash flows, right?

00:09:09.770 --> 00:09:12.200
At this point, by
the way, we kind of

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:17.090
merge together the final
coupon with the face value,

00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:20.470
and we'll just kind of be
talking about the coupons

00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:24.190
only, about cash flows only.

00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:31.655
And so that's the formula
for the bond price, is this.

00:09:31.655 --> 00:09:36.020
So basically, what's known
on the market is P, right,

00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:40.420
which is a price that's--
that instrument is traded.

00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:43.910
We also have defined
cash flows in the future.

00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:47.510
So we can solve for the yield.

00:09:47.510 --> 00:09:54.210
So essentially, if we
know the bond price,

00:09:54.210 --> 00:09:57.710
we can find the bond yield, OK?

00:09:57.710 --> 00:10:02.170
And if we know the bond yield,
we can find the bond price, OK?

00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:08.480
So typically, bonds are
traded in terms of its price.

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:11.630
But some bonds are
traded in terms of yield.

00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:15.280
But again, this is
like one-to-one.

00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:17.240
You can always go
back and forth.

00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:27.490
What's important is--
what has economic value,

00:10:27.490 --> 00:10:31.680
right, is the bond price,
OK, and the future cash

00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:34.200
amounts of cash flows.

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:36.644
And when you talk
about yield, it's

00:10:36.644 --> 00:10:37.810
not something that's traded.

00:10:37.810 --> 00:10:44.240
It's actually one of the ways
to align future cash flows

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:46.170
with the bond price.

00:10:46.170 --> 00:10:49.150
And that way assumes
that we have,

00:10:49.150 --> 00:10:55.110
again, constant discounting for
all time points in the future.

00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:58.700
And we will see that it may
or may not be optimal case.

00:11:03.250 --> 00:11:08.180
So what's also important when
we're talking about instrument

00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:11.380
price is to have the model
of how that price changes

00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:13.610
if the market changes.

00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:20.530
So here, we're talking about
sensitivity of the bond price

00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:21.130
to yield.

00:11:21.130 --> 00:11:25.630
And what is typically
done is basically

00:11:25.630 --> 00:11:27.435
to normalize by the
bond price itself.

00:11:29.950 --> 00:11:33.720
And then it's called
bond duration.

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:37.530
So the nice thing
about normalizing

00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:40.980
is that the duration
of that bond that you

00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:44.620
have in your portfolio doesn't
really depend on how many bonds

00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:45.400
you have, right?

00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:50.330
So it's basically more like
property of the bond itself,

00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:55.900
rather than how many bonds
you have in your portfolio.

00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:58.640
So if you take the
previous formula

00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:01.320
and take the derivative
with respect to y,

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:07.150
we get the following
formula for duration.

00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:12.360
And we know what
the price is, right?

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:17.540
And we can rewrite
this formula this way,

00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:27.680
which you see it's
a sum of t_i's times

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:31.370
some weights and divided
by the sum of the weights.

00:12:31.370 --> 00:12:35.840
So it's essentially a
weighted sum of time, OK?

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:41.910
And those pieces of time,
those moments of time

00:12:41.910 --> 00:12:46.580
is more important, as--
I mean the weights are

00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:51.870
proportional to present
values of future cash flows.

00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:56.250
So that's why bond duration
has a very nice kind

00:12:56.250 --> 00:12:57.265
of intuitive sense.

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:04.280
As a result of that, and yeah,
I forgot to mention one thing.

00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:07.540
So the duration is
always negative, right?

00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:15.570
So we have a sign here, because
if the bond price goes up,

00:13:15.570 --> 00:13:19.430
this means that the
yields goes down, OK?

00:13:19.430 --> 00:13:24.610
And if the yield goes
up, price goes down.

00:13:24.610 --> 00:13:26.450
And the explanation's
very simple.

00:13:26.450 --> 00:13:29.120
So yield is kind
of the same thing

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:33.900
as interest rate on the market.

00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:37.270
So if those rates
go up, this means

00:13:37.270 --> 00:13:40.540
that there will be more
discounting in the future cash

00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:43.220
flows, they will be
less valuable to me.

00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:47.770
So I'll be less willing to
pay for those cash flows, OK?

00:13:47.770 --> 00:13:52.280
So it's kind of fundamental
that relationship

00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:54.530
has a negative sign.

00:13:54.530 --> 00:13:59.790
So in case of a
zero-coupon bond,

00:13:59.790 --> 00:14:02.900
we only have one cash
flow in the future.

00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:07.720
So there is just one
weight, and that weight

00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:10.220
is totally assigned to
that last cash flow.

00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:18.780
So duration of zero-coupon
bond equals to maturity.

00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:21.400
Duration of regular
coupon bond depends,

00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:22.910
but it's always
less than maturity,

00:14:22.910 --> 00:14:26.055
just because we'll have a
weighted sum formula here.

00:14:32.090 --> 00:14:36.450
So essentially, that model
for the bond duration

00:14:36.450 --> 00:14:44.370
kind of assumes that all rates--
so we have just one yield

00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:47.350
number for everything,
so all rates go

00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:55.090
like in a parallel way, which
was OK before the crisis,

00:14:55.090 --> 00:14:57.357
right, where kind
of rates today are

00:14:57.357 --> 00:15:01.210
kind of similar to the rates
expected in the future.

00:15:01.210 --> 00:15:02.600
But it's no longer the case.

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:06.400
So the rates now, they're
higher than like one year ago,

00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:09.300
but they're still much lower
than expected in the future.

00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:12.720
So we expect that the
rates will go very high.

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:15.690
So the curve is very
steep at the moment.

00:15:15.690 --> 00:15:21.254
So that model of just
one number for everything

00:15:21.254 --> 00:15:22.170
might not be adequate.

00:15:22.170 --> 00:15:24.415
And we'll see how we can
improve this situation.

00:15:29.250 --> 00:15:31.970
So it's worth mentioning
the second derivative.

00:15:31.970 --> 00:15:34.230
We already spoke
about the price,

00:15:34.230 --> 00:15:36.790
first derivative of the
price with respect to yield,

00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:38.350
and a second.

00:15:38.350 --> 00:15:41.270
So for small changes
in the yield,

00:15:41.270 --> 00:15:46.390
you can assume that
it's linear, so it's

00:15:46.390 --> 00:15:48.120
OK to use just the
first derivative.

00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:56.420
So second derivative will be
necessary for larger movements

00:15:56.420 --> 00:15:59.270
of the market.

00:15:59.270 --> 00:16:07.557
Like as an example, if you're
a trader, right, and the bond

00:16:07.557 --> 00:16:08.140
trades, right?

00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:10.390
So we call it a cash product.

00:16:10.390 --> 00:16:13.760
Means that you actually don't
need any model to price it.

00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:17.060
You already have that price, OK?

00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:23.520
But if you try to explain like
why you might have lost money

00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:26.470
today, right, and that
always-- the trader

00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:29.910
always does that at
the end of the day.

00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:32.090
And we always use
first derivatives.

00:16:32.090 --> 00:16:36.380
And we try to explain it, but
there is also unexplained, OK?

00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:39.870
And that unexplained
can be quite high

00:16:39.870 --> 00:16:42.680
on this with large movements.

00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:45.720
So if you have like a
term in your analytics

00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:48.010
for the bond
convexity, that helps

00:16:48.010 --> 00:16:49.640
you to include the
second derivative,

00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:55.045
and therefore make the second
derivative smaller-- sorry--

00:16:55.045 --> 00:16:56.610
the unexplained smaller.

00:17:02.170 --> 00:17:08.020
So let's now talk about
interest rate swaps.

00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:12.410
So bond cash flow is
basically a stream

00:17:12.410 --> 00:17:16.425
of fixed cash flow, which
means that for certain dates

00:17:16.425 --> 00:17:18.300
it's just guaranteed
that you will be getting

00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:22.800
$100 with certain periodicity.

00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:26.680
A swap means you
exchange fixed payments

00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:28.430
with respect to some floating.

00:17:28.430 --> 00:17:33.060
And floating means that the
amount of money that you'll

00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:36.870
be getting or paying,
OK, receiving or paying,

00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:40.460
will depend on some
market observable.

00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:43.920
So for interest rate swap, it
will be typically-- and let's

00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:48.685
focus on the USD market, it will
be a three month LIBOR rate.

00:17:48.685 --> 00:17:51.890
That rate is
published daily, OK?

00:17:51.890 --> 00:17:56.300
And it's like if you
need to go to the bank

00:17:56.300 --> 00:17:59.470
and get a three month CD with
the money for the three months,

00:17:59.470 --> 00:18:01.130
that rate is already known.

00:18:01.130 --> 00:18:04.140
It's actually called
LIBOR, because it's

00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:14.400
kind of between banks, and
it's set at 11 AM London time.

00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:19.340
So as a result, we
already know how

00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:23.800
to price cash flows
in the future.

00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:32.460
So present value of the fixed
stream of payments, as we know,

00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:34.480
will be like this.

00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:41.780
And there is a floating
rate of cash flow as well.

00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:46.660
And the nice thing
about the swap

00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:51.290
is that when you enter the swap,
you don't pay any money, right?

00:18:51.290 --> 00:18:55.200
It's because you just kind
of enter the agreement,

00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:59.710
rather than when you
buy or sell a bond,

00:18:59.710 --> 00:19:02.010
there is some exchange of money.

00:19:02.010 --> 00:19:07.000
For swaps, swaps are
designed the way such

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:13.060
that-- so when you
make this agreement,

00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:17.520
it's a certain moment of time,
the fixed rate of the swap

00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:21.350
is picked in such a way
that the present value

00:19:21.350 --> 00:19:28.260
of fixed minus the floating
cash flows will be net to zero.

00:19:32.490 --> 00:19:36.730
So you can see, I mean, if
we rewrite those equations,

00:19:36.730 --> 00:19:39.970
OK, we can see that
the swap rate-- which

00:19:39.970 --> 00:19:43.890
is the most important
quantity of the swap,

00:19:43.890 --> 00:19:46.080
and something that
traders are basically

00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:47.350
are most concerned, right?

00:19:47.350 --> 00:19:50.830
So you first need to
define what the swap is.

00:19:50.830 --> 00:19:54.325
And for USD, you are saying
probably like 10 year swap, OK.

00:19:54.325 --> 00:19:55.200
And this is the rate.

00:19:55.200 --> 00:20:03.310
So the trader continuously kind
of quotes bid and offer levels

00:20:03.310 --> 00:20:05.140
of the swap rate.

00:20:05.140 --> 00:20:07.930
So no one is talking about
PVs and stuff like that.

00:20:07.930 --> 00:20:09.850
So it's always the swap rate.

00:20:09.850 --> 00:20:14.730
So that the swap rate is a
weighted sum of forward rates.

00:20:14.730 --> 00:20:19.200
And it has a very nice
intuitive explanation.

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:27.970
So you have some stream
of floating cash flows--

00:20:27.970 --> 00:20:31.470
variable cash flows--
which at the moment, like,

00:20:31.470 --> 00:20:35.520
will probably be low now,
but will be high in 10 years,

00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:38.940
will be much higher in 30 years.

00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:42.430
So the swap rate for
this kind of environment

00:20:42.430 --> 00:20:44.320
will be kind of
an average, right?

00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:49.815
And again, those weights depend
on the discounting factors.

00:20:53.190 --> 00:20:59.190
So later, we will see
that because we're

00:20:59.190 --> 00:21:02.925
talking about bond that
having a fixed cash

00:21:02.925 --> 00:21:05.750
flows in the futures, and a
swap that fixed in exchange

00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:13.300
of floating, swap can be hedged
with bond, "hedged" meaning

00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:21.640
that-- you know what the
term "hedged" means, no?

00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:25.990
Hedging means that if you have
just, let's say, a swap, right?

00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:30.070
So if market changes, right,
you can again lose money.

00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:38.250
So a typical task
for the money-maker,

00:21:38.250 --> 00:21:42.790
trader, is to kind of offset
that risk with something.

00:21:42.790 --> 00:21:46.430
Ideally, you sold
one swap, you bought

00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:49.670
another swap the same way
with a different rate.

00:21:49.670 --> 00:21:52.560
So you kind of locked
in your profit.

00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:55.330
But you remain with a zero risk.

00:22:00.580 --> 00:22:02.960
So let's try to
construct a yield curve.

00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:04.800
Why do we need the yield curve?

00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:11.360
So when we have,
let's say, a series

00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:14.660
of swap with different
maturities, right,

00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:18.450
all those swaps
will start today,

00:22:18.450 --> 00:22:22.160
and usually, swap will
have quarterly payment

00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:28.340
for the floating leg, and six
month payments for the fixed

00:22:28.340 --> 00:22:31.160
leg, and you'll have
different maturities.

00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:35.900
But if you try to kind
of get discount factors

00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:38.530
from that information,
you will see

00:22:38.530 --> 00:22:43.180
that you can get those discount
factors only for certain dates,

00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:44.000
OK?

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:48.300
But the typical
situation is that given

00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:51.580
on some liquid
market instruments,

00:22:51.580 --> 00:22:55.760
you want to price your
entire portfolio, which

00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:57.890
has continuous
spectrum of cash flows

00:22:57.890 --> 00:23:01.870
from now to 30 years, 40 years.

00:23:01.870 --> 00:23:07.860
And also, for typical
swap portfolio

00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:12.360
that I personally deal
with on a daily basis

00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:15.230
contains hundreds of
thousands of swaps.

00:23:15.230 --> 00:23:17.630
Every swap has many cash flows.

00:23:17.630 --> 00:23:21.710
So you need something
that can, based

00:23:21.710 --> 00:23:26.900
on discrete information of
reliable liquid instruments

00:23:26.900 --> 00:23:30.290
on the market, draw the line.

00:23:30.290 --> 00:23:33.210
Can basically
construct the curve.

00:23:33.210 --> 00:23:36.600
Which means that
you can, so that you

00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:39.530
are able to get discount
factors for any potential day

00:23:39.530 --> 00:23:41.990
in the future, or you
can compute forward rate

00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:45.380
for every date in the future.

00:23:45.380 --> 00:23:48.570
So the first step to
construct a yield curve

00:23:48.570 --> 00:23:53.590
is to select input
instruments for calibration.

00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:55.050
So you have a set
of instruments,

00:23:55.050 --> 00:23:56.780
and a new set of input quotes.

00:23:56.780 --> 00:23:59.840
Then you also need
to kind of decide

00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:02.000
what kind of properties
of that line will be.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:09.970
So you can say,
OK, first of all,

00:24:09.970 --> 00:24:13.010
you need to decide what
quantity will be interpolated.

00:24:13.010 --> 00:24:15.770
It could be daily
discount factors,

00:24:15.770 --> 00:24:19.820
or daily forward rates, or
maybe three-month forward rates.

00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:22.220
Then you select the spline type.

00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:24.480
So I'm not sure if you're
familiar with the splines.

00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:29.860
Probably you heard about
cubic spline, right?

00:24:29.860 --> 00:24:32.860
So there are different types
of splines, and some of them

00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:37.190
are better and some of them are
worse for different situation.

00:24:37.190 --> 00:24:38.940
And you also need
to decide like what

00:24:38.940 --> 00:24:41.750
that will be the node points
for the spline itself.

00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:42.920
OK.

00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:45.050
And then, as a
final step, so you

00:24:45.050 --> 00:24:47.420
have some mathematical
quantity, which

00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:50.310
is mathematical object where
you know what the line is,

00:24:50.310 --> 00:24:51.980
and you have control points.

00:24:51.980 --> 00:24:54.100
And you need to adjust
your control points such

00:24:54.100 --> 00:25:00.220
that when you reprice
your instruments,

00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:02.800
those instruments are repriced
exactly to the same quotes

00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:06.216
that you find on the market.

00:25:06.216 --> 00:25:07.445
You have a question.

00:25:07.445 --> 00:25:11.791
AUDIENCE: Is that spline,
again, is it just like a--

00:25:11.791 --> 00:25:12.832
IVAN MASYUKOV: All right.

00:25:12.832 --> 00:25:13.332
So let me.

00:25:22.890 --> 00:25:23.390
All right.

00:25:23.390 --> 00:25:26.645
So this is a picture
of the cubic spline.

00:25:31.070 --> 00:25:41.940
So spline is a way to
draw a smooth curve.

00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:44.050
This is an example
of the cubic spline.

00:25:44.050 --> 00:25:48.080
So you start to define
your node points.

00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:53.150
Your node points in this
case are 1, 10, 20, 40,

00:25:53.150 --> 00:25:56.320
80, 160, and 240, right?

00:25:56.320 --> 00:26:00.000
And then for every one
of those intervals,

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:04.600
OK, the functional form
of the shape of this curve

00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:09.840
is a cubic polynomial, OK?

00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:14.690
Well, if you just do cubic
polynomial for every interval

00:26:14.690 --> 00:26:17.680
without kind of putting
additional constraints,

00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:21.580
you can have all kinds of
boundary effects, like jumps,

00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:27.480
kinks, and other things, because
we want our cubic curve--

00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:33.820
cubic spline-- to be
meaningful, right?

00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:36.130
So we want to
maintain, to preserve

00:26:36.130 --> 00:26:42.250
maximum number of derivatives
for every node point.

00:26:42.250 --> 00:26:44.050
So we're not going to check.

00:26:44.050 --> 00:26:49.400
But believe me,
this curve, it is

00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:53.900
a cubic polynomial for
every one of those interval.

00:26:53.900 --> 00:26:58.960
And also, we have two continuous
derivative at every node point,

00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:04.100
because for the n
degree of the spline,

00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:05.720
you always have like n minus 1.

00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:08.860
You can have n minus 1.

00:27:08.860 --> 00:27:12.640
So the same thing, a
spline can be represented

00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:15.980
in terms of B-splines.

00:27:15.980 --> 00:27:18.720
B-spline is a new
type of spline.

00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:24.750
It's just as a representation
which is more intuitive,

00:27:24.750 --> 00:27:27.020
I should say.

00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:32.520
So all universe of the curves
with those node points,

00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:37.950
with two continuous
derivatives, can

00:27:37.950 --> 00:27:40.910
be represented as a linear
combination of those basis

00:27:40.910 --> 00:27:41.670
functions.

00:27:41.670 --> 00:27:43.660
So B-spline, I mean,
if you're interested,

00:27:43.660 --> 00:27:48.650
you should probably, we're not
going to discuss it in details,

00:27:48.650 --> 00:27:51.579
but it's nice separate
kind of topic about how

00:27:51.579 --> 00:27:52.620
to build those B-splines.

00:27:55.670 --> 00:28:00.530
But essentially, what's
nice about those B-splines--

00:28:00.530 --> 00:28:04.790
and "B," as you probably already
understood, B is basis, right?

00:28:04.790 --> 00:28:06.200
So you have like
basis functions.

00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:09.610
So those functions
look like bell shapes.

00:28:09.610 --> 00:28:13.600
They are non-zero on
some sub-interval.

00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:19.310
On every interval, it will
be a cubic polynomial.

00:28:19.310 --> 00:28:29.860
Everyone will have always
two continuous derivatives.

00:28:29.860 --> 00:28:32.070
As a result, in any
linear combination

00:28:32.070 --> 00:28:35.400
of those-- which
the first curve is--

00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:37.430
will also have that property.

00:28:50.530 --> 00:28:51.030
OK.

00:28:51.030 --> 00:28:54.900
So now we, yeah,
so the calibrate

00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:58.550
means that we basically
have some solver

00:28:58.550 --> 00:29:03.610
to make sure that our swaps with
the rates for those maturities

00:29:03.610 --> 00:29:06.420
actually repriced at par.

00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:10.510
At par means that
the PV is zero.

00:29:10.510 --> 00:29:15.120
This is a typical example of
the yield curve instruments.

00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:21.320
And IRS stands for
"interest rate swap,"

00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:25.250
and we have maturities
from one year to 30 years.

00:29:25.250 --> 00:29:36.540
And the quotes are
of 0.33% up to 2.67%.

00:29:36.540 --> 00:29:40.210
So you can see that
that's actually,

00:29:40.210 --> 00:29:44.190
that's from my
one-year-old presentation.

00:29:44.190 --> 00:29:47.030
Rates are quite high these days.

00:29:47.030 --> 00:29:52.060
So this is an example of
the yield curve graph.

00:29:52.060 --> 00:30:01.290
So again, so those are
the rates from 0.3 to 3.5.

00:30:01.290 --> 00:30:06.120
And the shape of the curve
is not flat at all, right?

00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:08.130
So it's actually pretty steep.

00:30:08.130 --> 00:30:13.000
So for the first five
years, it's very steep.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.760
Then it reaches the plateau.

00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:20.720
And then there is
some feature there,

00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:27.360
probably because of some
behavior in the 20-year region.

00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:30.330
So three-month forward
rate is the LIBOR rate.

00:30:30.330 --> 00:30:36.300
LIBOR is the rate
for the three month.

00:30:36.300 --> 00:30:38.880
It's mostly kind of common.

00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:43.840
And the reason why is because
the standard interest rate,

00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:48.100
USD swap has a
three-month frequency

00:30:48.100 --> 00:30:51.530
for payment on the floating leg.

00:30:51.530 --> 00:30:54.600
So if you're talking
about floating rates,

00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:55.860
is always three months.

00:30:55.860 --> 00:30:56.850
And it's always LIBOR.

00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:01.970
So because we've
already built the curve,

00:31:01.970 --> 00:31:07.660
now let's see how we can improve
the situation with a bond.

00:31:07.660 --> 00:31:11.430
So we have the curve, so we have
the discount factors, right?

00:31:11.430 --> 00:31:15.620
And we see that those discount
factors cannot be obtained

00:31:15.620 --> 00:31:18.620
on the assumption that you
have just one parameter yield

00:31:18.620 --> 00:31:22.450
for everything, because the
curve we know is not flat.

00:31:22.450 --> 00:31:31.450
So if we just try to price it
using those discount factors,

00:31:31.450 --> 00:31:34.040
try to get a fair
price, we probably

00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:35.930
won't match the
market observables.

00:31:35.930 --> 00:31:38.140
So we need some extra term.

00:31:38.140 --> 00:31:41.700
And again, here we can
use it in a similar form

00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:44.330
as we did it for the yield.

00:31:44.330 --> 00:31:48.910
But right now it's going to be
a small correction to the yield

00:31:48.910 --> 00:31:54.140
curve, rather than kind
of really rough assumption

00:31:54.140 --> 00:31:58.140
about that the
curve is flat, OK?

00:31:58.140 --> 00:32:10.010
So typically, if the curve
magnitude is, let's say, 3%.

00:32:10.010 --> 00:32:10.510
OK?

00:32:10.510 --> 00:32:14.490
So the spread is
probably 100 times lower.

00:32:14.490 --> 00:32:20.245
So having a nice correction
is always better, right?

00:32:23.850 --> 00:32:31.090
And another nice feature is that
of this approach for the bond,

00:32:31.090 --> 00:32:34.350
like if we already build
our yield curve model,

00:32:34.350 --> 00:32:37.935
and we know sensitivities
of our portfolio

00:32:37.935 --> 00:32:41.290
to inputs of the curves,
which then transition

00:32:41.290 --> 00:32:46.410
into like differences
in discount factors,

00:32:46.410 --> 00:32:48.690
we can easily apply
that to the bond.

00:32:48.690 --> 00:32:53.050
We can first find what
this spread parameter

00:32:53.050 --> 00:32:59.380
is, to solve for s knowing P,
which is very liquid market

00:32:59.380 --> 00:33:01.070
tradable.

00:33:01.070 --> 00:33:04.919
And then we can kind of use
consistent model for the bonds

00:33:04.919 --> 00:33:06.210
and the swaps in our portfolio.

00:33:08.780 --> 00:33:10.637
Any questions?

00:33:10.637 --> 00:33:11.220
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:33:11.220 --> 00:33:15.392
So what does the bond rate
tell us about the bond?

00:33:19.740 --> 00:33:22.880
IVAN MASYUKOV: That's
a very good question.

00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:31.770
So it might tell us something
like bond liquidity,

00:33:31.770 --> 00:33:32.980
for example.

00:33:32.980 --> 00:33:34.575
Like if it's not
liquid, or there

00:33:34.575 --> 00:33:42.280
is some-- so it may be
related to the bond itself.

00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:45.590
And sometimes we kind
of think that the bond

00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:48.720
is riskless, which means
that-- especially if it's

00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:53.710
issued by US government,
which if we can assume

00:33:53.710 --> 00:33:58.600
that those cash flows in the
futures are guaranteed, right,

00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:01.961
then I basically will
be willing to bring

00:34:01.961 --> 00:34:04.210
a certain amount of money
and discount factors, right?

00:34:04.210 --> 00:34:07.610
But if you tell me that you
will pay me that in the future,

00:34:07.610 --> 00:34:11.020
I won't be so certain, right?

00:34:11.020 --> 00:34:16.199
So I'll need to add some
kind of credit spread

00:34:16.199 --> 00:34:18.980
to that-- we call it credit
spreads-- as a result.

00:34:18.980 --> 00:34:23.590
It's the credit spread will
kind of propagate to the spread

00:34:23.590 --> 00:34:24.469
number.

00:34:24.469 --> 00:34:28.090
On the other hand, if the bond
is really US government-issued,

00:34:28.090 --> 00:34:32.909
and is considered
to be guaranteed,

00:34:32.909 --> 00:34:36.100
then it may be a
feature of the swap, OK?

00:34:36.100 --> 00:34:41.469
Where just because of
some liquidity situations

00:34:41.469 --> 00:34:43.770
in swap market--
like all of a sudden,

00:34:43.770 --> 00:34:47.670
let's say, all option
traders on the street

00:34:47.670 --> 00:34:49.909
needed this 10-year swap, OK?

00:34:49.909 --> 00:34:54.429
Because they kind of need to
hedge certain very popular

00:34:54.429 --> 00:34:58.380
products-- volatility products--
they'll start to buy it,

00:34:58.380 --> 00:35:03.200
that spread will change.

00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:04.780
But what's even
more interesting,

00:35:04.780 --> 00:35:08.000
that spread is
tradable by itself, OK?

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:12.910
So you can go to the market
and you trade the spread.

00:35:12.910 --> 00:35:18.290
Moreover, let's look,
like, 10-year situation.

00:35:18.290 --> 00:35:24.690
So you have 10-year
bond on the market.

00:35:24.690 --> 00:35:29.340
You have tradable swap, and
you have tradable spread.

00:35:29.340 --> 00:35:32.021
So the question is which
one is the most liquid?

00:35:32.021 --> 00:35:32.770
What do you think?

00:35:38.300 --> 00:35:42.520
The most liquid is
the bond, of course.

00:35:42.520 --> 00:35:45.890
It has much more liquidity.

00:35:45.890 --> 00:35:47.730
Surprisingly, the second one.

00:35:47.730 --> 00:35:52.430
It's the spread between
the 10-year swap

00:35:52.430 --> 00:35:54.690
and the bond is
traded in the market.

00:35:54.690 --> 00:35:58.470
So there's more
transaction on the spread

00:35:58.470 --> 00:36:00.910
rather compared to the swap.

00:36:00.910 --> 00:36:03.970
As a result, when
we built our curves,

00:36:03.970 --> 00:36:08.540
we're not taking like
10-year swap from the market.

00:36:08.540 --> 00:36:09.040
OK.

00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:13.360
We actually take the
yield and the spread.

00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:16.696
And that's how we
define the most kind

00:36:16.696 --> 00:36:18.380
of reliable level of the swap.

00:36:18.380 --> 00:36:20.450
Of course, we could
have just take

00:36:20.450 --> 00:36:23.340
whatever we observe
for the 10-year swap,

00:36:23.340 --> 00:36:25.790
but it could be off.

00:36:25.790 --> 00:36:29.160
And also, if you observe, there
will be more bid-offer spread

00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:29.660
as well.

00:36:35.650 --> 00:36:40.700
So as an example,
let's try to shift

00:36:40.700 --> 00:36:45.780
one of the inputs of the
curve by one basis point.

00:36:45.780 --> 00:36:50.260
And that will result in
this kind of deviation

00:36:50.260 --> 00:36:57.640
of forward trades, which will
be combination of basis splines.

00:36:57.640 --> 00:36:59.680
But what's interesting
first of all,

00:36:59.680 --> 00:37:01.925
it's kind of complicated
[INAUDIBLE] behavior.

00:37:01.925 --> 00:37:07.120
The reason why is because you
are saying that nothing changed

00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:09.330
before the nine
year, like nothing

00:37:09.330 --> 00:37:13.640
changed after ninth year,
but just point in between.

00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:17.030
So in order to calibrate to
that kind of weird condition,

00:37:17.030 --> 00:37:22.310
right, you need to
have a ripple here.

00:37:22.310 --> 00:37:27.590
But what also is more important
is that by shifting one year

00:37:27.590 --> 00:37:32.460
basis point by one basis
point, that the amplitude

00:37:32.460 --> 00:37:37.370
of shifts in the curve
reaches 14 basis points.

00:37:37.370 --> 00:37:41.550
So not sure if you're familiar,
but it's an ill-posed problem

00:37:41.550 --> 00:37:42.050
right?

00:37:42.050 --> 00:37:45.800
So small changes in your inputs
can cause large variations

00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:46.590
in your outputs.

00:37:49.450 --> 00:37:51.230
This is a very important slide.

00:37:51.230 --> 00:37:56.100
So the first column
is, again, we

00:37:56.100 --> 00:37:59.230
saw those are our
instruments, quotes,

00:37:59.230 --> 00:38:01.420
and this is the risk
of the portfolio.

00:38:01.420 --> 00:38:05.100
That's something that a
trader needs no matter what.

00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:07.930
It basically shows
you what happens

00:38:07.930 --> 00:38:11.570
on the market if
different-- what

00:38:11.570 --> 00:38:13.250
will be the change
in your portfolio

00:38:13.250 --> 00:38:14.740
if the market changes.

00:38:14.740 --> 00:38:18.220
So the meaning of the number--
for example, for the five

00:38:18.220 --> 00:38:25.700
year-- is that if five year rate
moves up by one basis point,

00:38:25.700 --> 00:38:28.845
we'll lose minus 700K.

00:38:36.390 --> 00:38:41.250
We also marked
here yellow points

00:38:41.250 --> 00:38:44.530
that are more liquid
than the others.

00:38:44.530 --> 00:38:47.940
So now a typical
situation is that you need

00:38:47.940 --> 00:38:49.880
to hedge your portfolio, right?

00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:57.800
So you need to liquidate your
risk, I'm basically saying,

00:38:57.800 --> 00:39:00.720
OK, given the
model that we have,

00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:07.030
I want its value to be
insensitive to any movements

00:39:07.030 --> 00:39:08.600
on the market.

00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:12.170
So for that purpose, what
you can do, you can go

00:39:12.170 --> 00:39:20.290
and you can buy as many
one-year swaps as plus 200,

00:39:20.290 --> 00:39:27.490
as many two-year swaps which
would be the risk of minus 1.3,

00:39:27.490 --> 00:39:30.640
and so forth, right?

00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:35.550
Then that always
cost you money right?

00:39:35.550 --> 00:39:41.180
And that money is kind of
proportional to bid-offer

00:39:41.180 --> 00:39:42.770
of the particular instruments.

00:39:42.770 --> 00:39:45.880
And that bid-offer is smaller
for liquid instruments

00:39:45.880 --> 00:39:51.450
and larger for less
liquid instruments.

00:39:51.450 --> 00:39:53.520
So if you multiply
by the diff-- we

00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:55.270
can see that if we
want to hedge our risk,

00:39:55.270 --> 00:39:58.300
it's going to be
quite expensive.

00:39:58.300 --> 00:40:00.610
It will cost us 3.6
million dollars.

00:40:04.037 --> 00:40:05.480
Any questions so far?

00:40:11.820 --> 00:40:23.440
So traders never hedge
every bucket in the risk.

00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:25.890
Bucket means every line here.

00:40:25.890 --> 00:40:30.480
So you always see some
numbers, but if you

00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:33.210
try to make every
number here zero,

00:40:33.210 --> 00:40:36.530
which means that if
you trade seven here,

00:40:36.530 --> 00:40:38.460
you also could try
to go to the market,

00:40:38.460 --> 00:40:43.890
find the offsetting seven here,
you'll have to pay too much

00:40:43.890 --> 00:40:50.030
and you won't be profitable.

00:40:50.030 --> 00:40:54.210
So what the traders do if
someone ask for the seven year,

00:40:54.210 --> 00:40:57.070
they make this transaction,
but they go, then

00:40:57.070 --> 00:40:59.680
hedge it from the more
liquid points, which

00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:01.520
is less expensive to buy.

00:41:05.030 --> 00:41:07.740
So we need a better
model for hedging.

00:41:07.740 --> 00:41:12.820
And a general formulation of
the model is presented here.

00:41:12.820 --> 00:41:22.380
So we have portfolio risk which
is a just the vector here,

00:41:22.380 --> 00:41:24.030
right?

00:41:24.030 --> 00:41:29.950
And we have hedging.

00:41:29.950 --> 00:41:33.610
Portfolio risk is basically
if you have candidates

00:41:33.610 --> 00:41:37.320
of instruments that you can use
for portfolio hedging, again,

00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:40.820
the risk will be represented
in this format in terms

00:41:40.820 --> 00:41:44.505
of sensitivities to swap rates.

00:41:47.050 --> 00:41:54.160
And we have weights of
that hedging portfolio

00:41:54.160 --> 00:41:55.970
that we need to find, obviously.

00:41:55.970 --> 00:41:57.440
So you have this
hedging portfolio.

00:41:57.440 --> 00:42:02.190
You multiply H by x, you get
risk of this hedging portfolio.

00:42:02.190 --> 00:42:05.050
You add it to the risk
of your portfolio.

00:42:05.050 --> 00:42:07.177
And then, what we
need to minimize,

00:42:07.177 --> 00:42:08.760
you don't need to
minimize everything.

00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:10.301
But you need to if
they give you, OK?

00:42:10.301 --> 00:42:11.630
What can happen on the market?

00:42:11.630 --> 00:42:14.300
What are the typical
modes of the market?

00:42:14.300 --> 00:42:19.530
And so essentially you
kind of define your market

00:42:19.530 --> 00:42:24.810
scenarios, which can be
found in a different way.

00:42:24.810 --> 00:42:27.520
So one of the ways to
approach that problem

00:42:27.520 --> 00:42:33.260
is to use principal
component analysis.

00:42:33.260 --> 00:42:37.670
I know you already
are familiar with SVD.

00:42:37.670 --> 00:42:50.370
So if D is data of market
movements in matrix--

00:42:50.370 --> 00:42:57.240
then any matrix can be
decomposed using SVD.

00:42:57.240 --> 00:43:04.350
And we can then look at this
spectrum of this decomposition,

00:43:04.350 --> 00:43:09.940
looking at those
eigenvalues, and just

00:43:09.940 --> 00:43:13.160
pick the ones that look
high enough for us,

00:43:13.160 --> 00:43:14.760
and just keep that number.

00:43:14.760 --> 00:43:20.200
And let's, for example, we find
that we really investigated

00:43:20.200 --> 00:43:29.180
this market, and we
found that there are just

00:43:29.180 --> 00:43:32.130
five components that
drive the market,

00:43:32.130 --> 00:43:36.130
and the rest is just so little
that it's meaningless, right?

00:43:36.130 --> 00:43:38.200
On every day, and we are
certain that it's just

00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:42.820
five components, five
modes of market moments.

00:43:42.820 --> 00:43:48.060
Then, if we have a curve
that consists of 20 points,

00:43:48.060 --> 00:43:50.600
we don't need to
hedge every swap

00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:52.550
with its corresponding maturity.

00:43:52.550 --> 00:43:57.100
We can just pick
five swaps that are

00:43:57.100 --> 00:43:59.030
liquid enough and
cheap enough for us

00:43:59.030 --> 00:44:00.720
to hedge, and just use them.

00:44:08.990 --> 00:44:11.720
So let's look now at
those typical graphs

00:44:11.720 --> 00:44:16.190
of those principal components.

00:44:16.190 --> 00:44:19.210
X-axis is the swap
maturity in years,

00:44:19.210 --> 00:44:22.380
and y is some kind of
relative, let's think

00:44:22.380 --> 00:44:23.920
of that as basis points.

00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:26.760
So blue line is
the first component

00:44:26.760 --> 00:44:30.610
which is the prevalent.

00:44:30.610 --> 00:44:34.600
And it kind of, you can
see that swap rates,

00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:37.090
they're basically
flattish after 10 years,

00:44:37.090 --> 00:44:40.500
but the first component
is pretty steep.

00:44:40.500 --> 00:44:47.760
And what it says as well is that
the main behavior of the market

00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:50.010
is that rates now do
not move, but they

00:44:50.010 --> 00:44:51.340
will move in the future.

00:44:51.340 --> 00:44:53.750
And that's basically because
Fed is in a hold, right?

00:44:53.750 --> 00:44:57.030
So they kind of stimulate
the market in a way such

00:44:57.030 --> 00:45:02.030
that the rate remains the same
until sometime in the future.

00:45:02.030 --> 00:45:10.440
Mode number two is a kind
of like tilting situation.

00:45:10.440 --> 00:45:13.050
Mode number three
is more complex.

00:45:13.050 --> 00:45:15.770
And we'll have several
other modes here as well.

00:45:19.910 --> 00:45:25.950
So now, following our
previous general approach

00:45:25.950 --> 00:45:27.920
to the problem,
we formulated here

00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:35.030
as-- so we have PCA
factors here in P.

00:45:35.030 --> 00:45:38.390
And now, because the number
of factors that we selected

00:45:38.390 --> 00:45:40.140
is the number of
hedging instruments--

00:45:40.140 --> 00:45:42.200
we no longer need to minimize.

00:45:42.200 --> 00:45:44.890
We can always feed, which
you can always achieve

00:45:44.890 --> 00:45:46.527
like perfect minimization.

00:45:46.527 --> 00:45:47.860
We can always achieve that zero.

00:45:47.860 --> 00:45:52.610
So that's why we
formulate it as zero.

00:45:52.610 --> 00:45:54.765
So solving that problem here.

00:45:58.230 --> 00:45:58.730
Yeah.

00:45:58.730 --> 00:46:01.930
And the hedging matrix, this is
an example of hedging matrix.

00:46:01.930 --> 00:46:09.260
So what that matrix says is
that if I take one year swap

00:46:09.260 --> 00:46:11.450
and put in my portfolio,
empty portfolio,

00:46:11.450 --> 00:46:17.500
and then they apply my model,
I'll have just sensitivity

00:46:17.500 --> 00:46:19.310
to that particular swap.

00:46:19.310 --> 00:46:24.580
Which kind of makes
sense, because since you

00:46:24.580 --> 00:46:29.020
use the same instruments to
calibrate your yield curve,

00:46:29.020 --> 00:46:33.770
right, then it should be
sensitive to itself only.

00:46:33.770 --> 00:46:37.690
That's why that matrix
is just ones for itself,

00:46:37.690 --> 00:46:40.880
and zeroes otherwise.

00:46:40.880 --> 00:46:47.860
So then, as a result,
we get this matrix.

00:46:47.860 --> 00:46:50.690
So same portfolio
that we had before.

00:46:50.690 --> 00:46:58.250
This is our PCA matrix
that translates our risk

00:46:58.250 --> 00:47:07.286
into those few numbers, right?

00:47:07.286 --> 00:47:12.730
And because we know it
translates our risk-- low risk,

00:47:12.730 --> 00:47:17.350
in terms of many curve
inputs-- into just five most

00:47:17.350 --> 00:47:21.230
liquid ones, which is
1, 2, 5, 10, and 30.

00:47:21.230 --> 00:47:24.300
As a result, our
translated risk,

00:47:24.300 --> 00:47:29.770
which tells us what we need
to do to hedge our portfolio,

00:47:29.770 --> 00:47:31.095
is just those numbers.

00:47:31.095 --> 00:47:35.990
And now, if we take a
bid-offer charge, 0.1 basis

00:47:35.990 --> 00:47:38.420
points for those,
and multiply, we

00:47:38.420 --> 00:47:40.160
get numbers which are
orders of magnitude

00:47:40.160 --> 00:47:42.060
smaller than we
got before, right?

00:47:42.060 --> 00:47:46.760
So we probably get something
like there were 400.

00:47:46.760 --> 00:47:51.220
It's not 4 million--
3.6 million anymore.

00:47:51.220 --> 00:47:54.650
That's exactly what traders do.

00:47:54.650 --> 00:47:58.190
And different traders
have different opinions

00:47:58.190 --> 00:47:59.745
of what dynamics
of the market is.

00:48:04.770 --> 00:48:06.390
But they always have some model.

00:48:14.060 --> 00:48:15.360
So disadvantages.

00:48:15.360 --> 00:48:20.120
So PCA model is something
that just formally attuned

00:48:20.120 --> 00:48:22.690
to historical data.

00:48:22.690 --> 00:48:30.960
I always say that if you take
kind of scramble your swap

00:48:30.960 --> 00:48:34.140
maturities in your model,
and you do your computations,

00:48:34.140 --> 00:48:36.450
and you kind of
unscramble them, you

00:48:36.450 --> 00:48:42.820
get exactly the same result.
Which means that in PCA model,

00:48:42.820 --> 00:48:44.940
you don't put any
constraints on that.

00:48:47.510 --> 00:48:49.400
Two year is very
close to one year,

00:48:49.400 --> 00:48:51.560
and two year is between
one year and five year.

00:48:55.250 --> 00:48:58.680
So PCA model or hedging
coefficients of that matrix

00:48:58.680 --> 00:49:06.730
is not very stable-- especially
for recent modes in the market.

00:49:06.730 --> 00:49:11.780
Also, because SVDs kind
of is the least squares

00:49:11.780 --> 00:49:14.530
approximation, it's very
sensitive to outliers.

00:49:14.530 --> 00:49:19.150
So there is just one event on
the market that kind of one day

00:49:19.150 --> 00:49:21.510
happens, something
like rates went up,

00:49:21.510 --> 00:49:24.160
and then it went
down significantly,

00:49:24.160 --> 00:49:30.260
it may have unnecessarily
high influence on the outputs.

00:49:30.260 --> 00:49:32.720
And if those coefficients
change daily,

00:49:32.720 --> 00:49:36.410
right, then again,
it may be too costly.

00:49:36.410 --> 00:49:39.810
And quite often we just
overfitting to historical data.

00:49:39.810 --> 00:49:42.700
So we're saying,
OK, what can I do.

00:49:42.700 --> 00:49:44.600
I just take
historical data, and I

00:49:44.600 --> 00:49:50.390
prove that my model works, would
have worked for the last three

00:49:50.390 --> 00:49:54.180
years, or the last
three months, but that

00:49:54.180 --> 00:49:57.298
doesn't mean that it will work
for the next three months.

00:50:04.830 --> 00:50:09.290
If we kind of try to put
some additional constraints

00:50:09.290 --> 00:50:12.456
or additional thoughts about
what this behavior should be,

00:50:12.456 --> 00:50:13.580
this may improve situation.

00:50:16.290 --> 00:50:21.420
So PCA interpretation
is that risk matrix

00:50:21.420 --> 00:50:28.050
is a linear combination of
principal components producing

00:50:28.050 --> 00:50:30.520
a shift on one hedging
instrument at a time.

00:50:35.780 --> 00:50:41.640
Now the question is, let's
forget about historical, OK?

00:50:41.640 --> 00:50:43.300
Is there any other approach?

00:50:43.300 --> 00:50:46.619
We know historical is noisy,
and it's kind of first step

00:50:46.619 --> 00:50:47.910
if you want to build the model.

00:50:47.910 --> 00:50:51.250
But can we do something better?

00:50:51.250 --> 00:50:54.422
And the answer is yes.

00:50:54.422 --> 00:51:01.570
So we can say that we
have our yield curve

00:51:01.570 --> 00:51:04.880
in terms of forward rates.

00:51:04.880 --> 00:51:07.487
And typically, when
we build this curve,

00:51:07.487 --> 00:51:08.695
we observe that it is smooth.

00:51:11.650 --> 00:51:15.130
It's smooth not only because
we use smooth splines,

00:51:15.130 --> 00:51:25.520
but also because if there is
no certainty about some event

00:51:25.520 --> 00:51:32.420
in 10 years from now, there
is no reason to kind of expect

00:51:32.420 --> 00:51:36.280
there will be spike or
some non-smooth feature

00:51:36.280 --> 00:51:39.940
in the forward rate space.

00:51:39.940 --> 00:51:44.880
So what we can do
is that we can try

00:51:44.880 --> 00:51:50.010
to minimize those
equations where Jacobian

00:51:50.010 --> 00:51:56.010
is a matrix translating
shifts of yield curve inputs

00:51:56.010 --> 00:51:58.580
into movements of
forward trades.

00:51:58.580 --> 00:52:04.000
So essentially, we will try
to penalize non-smoothness.

00:52:09.160 --> 00:52:11.760
And the solution
will be like this,

00:52:11.760 --> 00:52:17.210
with some kind of-- so we'll
be adding a penalty, OK.

00:52:17.210 --> 00:52:20.470
And penalty will be a small
regularization parameter.

00:52:25.930 --> 00:52:31.070
So this is, as an example,
that's what we get.

00:52:35.500 --> 00:52:37.530
Again, here in that model.

00:52:40.640 --> 00:52:47.200
You can view this matrix
as if one year rate moves,

00:52:47.200 --> 00:52:51.360
what it basically-- so your
drivers are 1, 2, 5, 10s,

00:52:51.360 --> 00:52:51.860
and 30s.

00:52:51.860 --> 00:52:56.100
So that's your drivers.

00:52:56.100 --> 00:52:59.230
Knowing the movements
of your drivers,

00:52:59.230 --> 00:53:02.090
what would be the response
to your swap rates?

00:53:02.090 --> 00:53:06.150
And you know that it will
always be one to itself,

00:53:06.150 --> 00:53:08.490
right, as you see here.

00:53:08.490 --> 00:53:11.390
And in between, it will be
kind of a smooth functions.

00:53:21.900 --> 00:53:26.960
So let's take, this
moment, a broader view

00:53:26.960 --> 00:53:31.290
at what the pricing model does.

00:53:31.290 --> 00:53:36.180
And we have a pricing
engine, essentially.

00:53:36.180 --> 00:53:38.860
It's a way, if you have all
model parameters-- including

00:53:38.860 --> 00:53:42.490
curves, volatility, the
surface, everything, right?

00:53:42.490 --> 00:53:50.050
And in order for
those parameters

00:53:50.050 --> 00:53:52.950
to be consistent with
the benchmark prices,

00:53:52.950 --> 00:53:58.310
you need some
calibration engine which

00:53:58.310 --> 00:54:02.190
matches market observables
to the ones that's

00:54:02.190 --> 00:54:08.970
been repriced by the model
output of the pricing engine.

00:54:08.970 --> 00:54:19.300
And once you make sure that
benchmark prices of your model

00:54:19.300 --> 00:54:25.520
equal or are kind of close
enough to benchmark prices

00:54:25.520 --> 00:54:28.360
observed in the market,
you calibrated the model,

00:54:28.360 --> 00:54:35.160
then you can essentially
price your portfolio,

00:54:35.160 --> 00:54:36.610
and get values and risk.

00:54:43.780 --> 00:54:50.610
So let's look at one of
the nice examples of how

00:54:50.610 --> 00:54:57.060
that pricing engine and pricing
and calibration process works.

00:54:57.060 --> 00:55:07.070
We'll look at HJM model, which
is used to price volatility

00:55:07.070 --> 00:55:08.820
products.

00:55:08.820 --> 00:55:13.470
So we're not going to go into
too many details about this,

00:55:13.470 --> 00:55:19.920
but this is equations of
evolution of forward rates

00:55:19.920 --> 00:55:24.510
that we need for simulation,
for Monte Carlo simulation.

00:55:24.510 --> 00:55:27.851
What we're saying here is this
change of the forward rates--

00:55:27.851 --> 00:55:29.600
because forward rates
is the quantity that

00:55:29.600 --> 00:55:33.420
is being assimilated--
has some drift, OK?

00:55:33.420 --> 00:55:35.460
Because dt is time.

00:55:35.460 --> 00:55:41.720
And also, it has some
dependence on the forward rates

00:55:41.720 --> 00:55:43.560
to the power of beta, right?

00:55:43.560 --> 00:55:50.860
So if it's log-normal
model, beta will be one.

00:55:50.860 --> 00:55:54.270
If it's normal model,
beta will be zero.

00:55:54.270 --> 00:55:57.080
But in general, it's different.

00:55:57.080 --> 00:55:59.580
Then we have volatility
surface, right,

00:55:59.580 --> 00:56:04.500
which kind of gives you what
the number of volatility

00:56:04.500 --> 00:56:09.880
to use for this calendar
and forward time.

00:56:09.880 --> 00:56:14.812
And we have correlation and
factor structure which we're

00:56:14.812 --> 00:56:16.020
not going to talk about here.

00:56:16.020 --> 00:56:19.990
And this is Brownian motions.

00:56:19.990 --> 00:56:24.820
So we're not going to go
any more complex like this.

00:56:24.820 --> 00:56:28.580
We'll just start looking at
nice, two-dimensional surfaces

00:56:28.580 --> 00:56:35.570
here, and see what are the
problems of calibrating

00:56:35.570 --> 00:56:36.770
the volatility surface.

00:56:40.800 --> 00:56:45.062
Just to give you
a diagram of when

00:56:45.062 --> 00:56:47.020
we look at the surface,
what different elements

00:56:47.020 --> 00:56:48.670
of that surface mean.

00:56:54.060 --> 00:56:55.650
It's a triangular surface.

00:56:55.650 --> 00:57:00.250
You have a calendar time, right,
and you have a forward time.

00:57:00.250 --> 00:57:05.660
So your simulation starts
at the first vertical line.

00:57:05.660 --> 00:57:10.500
So you have forward
rates here as calibrated

00:57:10.500 --> 00:57:12.360
from the curve as of today.

00:57:12.360 --> 00:57:17.740
So those are square boxes
here, square elements.

00:57:17.740 --> 00:57:21.240
So you need to
kind of transition

00:57:21.240 --> 00:57:23.940
from the first line
to the second step

00:57:23.940 --> 00:57:27.370
using Monte Carlo simulation.

00:57:27.370 --> 00:57:33.750
And that's when, for
every arrow here,

00:57:33.750 --> 00:57:36.890
you need the volatility number.

00:57:36.890 --> 00:57:40.994
Then, once you did
your Monte Carlo

00:57:40.994 --> 00:57:42.410
simulation for the
second one, you

00:57:42.410 --> 00:57:44.230
need ones for the third one.

00:57:44.230 --> 00:57:48.700
And again you need data--
which volatility to use, OK?

00:57:48.700 --> 00:57:51.280
So essentially, the
surface that we'll

00:57:51.280 --> 00:57:54.160
be looking at on next
slides is essentially

00:57:54.160 --> 00:57:56.840
representing the numbers
necessary for this transition's

00:57:56.840 --> 00:58:00.250
volatility for every arrow.

00:58:00.250 --> 00:58:08.580
So to explain, there are
different areas here.

00:58:08.580 --> 00:58:18.170
Like, for example, those will
be-- if one step is one here,

00:58:18.170 --> 00:58:25.760
OK, we're talking about this, it
will be the forward rates that

00:58:25.760 --> 00:58:28.800
will be observed in two years.

00:58:28.800 --> 00:58:34.045
That one will be observed as of
now for like one year from now.

00:58:34.045 --> 00:58:36.630
But again, in two years.

00:58:36.630 --> 00:58:44.240
And so those rates are
essential to compute the swap,

00:58:44.240 --> 00:58:45.930
forward swap rate.

00:58:45.930 --> 00:58:50.730
And if we do our Monte
Carlo simulation,

00:58:50.730 --> 00:58:53.370
that's essential
information that we

00:58:53.370 --> 00:58:57.130
need to compute the
price for the option

00:58:57.130 --> 00:59:01.180
on the swap, which we're
not going to discuss here.

00:59:01.180 --> 00:59:05.320
But just an example, it shows
that for different instruments

00:59:05.320 --> 00:59:09.885
observed in the market
you have quite overlapping

00:59:09.885 --> 00:59:10.760
areas of sensitivity.

00:59:16.940 --> 00:59:23.440
So this is a typical example
of the volatility surface

00:59:23.440 --> 00:59:26.860
where this is calendar
time, this is forward time.

00:59:26.860 --> 00:59:33.100
And it has spikes
for certain regions.

00:59:33.100 --> 00:59:34.460
But in general, it's smooth.

00:59:38.880 --> 00:59:42.090
So why this problem
is challenging.

00:59:45.900 --> 00:59:48.740
If we try to compute the
triangle matrix, which

00:59:48.740 --> 00:59:53.190
has dimension of 240 by
240-- the reason why is 240

00:59:53.190 --> 00:59:58.510
is because every element
is for three months, OK?

00:59:58.510 --> 01:00:06.080
But we need up to
60 years of data,

01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:12.110
which means that
it's 60 by 4, which

01:00:12.110 --> 01:00:14.630
is the number of
quarters, is 240 by 240.

01:00:14.630 --> 01:00:18.310
If you just need triangle
elements, it's 200K elements.

01:00:18.310 --> 01:00:23.360
So if you try to calibrate
everything at the same time,

01:00:23.360 --> 01:00:26.710
and you formally try
to solve your problem,

01:00:26.710 --> 01:00:33.130
you kind of needed to store, at
least to build a matrix of 28K

01:00:33.130 --> 01:00:35.230
by 28K.

01:00:35.230 --> 01:00:40.060
And we just don't
have memory for this.

01:00:40.060 --> 01:00:41.840
And we also have
very small number

01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:47.660
of calibration instruments only
in terms of swaptions or caps,

01:00:47.660 --> 01:00:49.360
which are typical
volatility products.

01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:51.890
We just have a
relatively small number.

01:00:51.890 --> 01:00:55.330
So it's an
underdetermined problem.

01:00:55.330 --> 01:00:58.840
We also, as we saw on
the previous example,

01:00:58.840 --> 01:01:05.030
areas of sensitivity of
different instruments overlap.

01:01:05.030 --> 01:01:08.320
And it's an ill-posed
inverse problems which

01:01:08.320 --> 01:01:13.750
produces unstable solutions.

01:01:13.750 --> 01:01:18.760
And no matter what we do,
right, the resulting surface

01:01:18.760 --> 01:01:19.940
should be nice, right?

01:01:19.940 --> 01:01:20.940
Should look nice, right?

01:01:20.940 --> 01:01:27.320
Because if it has spikes in
some points in the future, then

01:01:27.320 --> 01:01:29.690
we either have an
economic reason for this,

01:01:29.690 --> 01:01:32.640
or we claim that this is
something that's not realistic.

01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:41.650
So this is how we
approach the problem.

01:01:41.650 --> 01:01:44.540
So the first step, we represent
our volatility surface.

01:01:44.540 --> 01:01:49.520
And here, even though volatility
surface is two-dimensional

01:01:49.520 --> 01:01:56.710
we just kind of assign a number
for every of those elements,

01:01:56.710 --> 01:02:00.750
OK, and then represent the
surface as a vector, OK?

01:02:00.750 --> 01:02:03.160
Whereas saying that
the new surface v

01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:10.255
will be some initial state
plus a linear combination

01:02:10.255 --> 01:02:12.230
of basis functions.

01:02:12.230 --> 01:02:15.730
And basis functions
should correspond

01:02:15.730 --> 01:02:22.240
to some reasonable
functions, OK?

01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:25.180
But the nice feature is that
number of basis functions

01:02:25.180 --> 01:02:30.467
will be much smaller than
the number of elements

01:02:30.467 --> 01:02:32.380
that we need to calibrate.

01:02:32.380 --> 01:02:35.970
But we will be very formal here.

01:02:35.970 --> 01:02:38.850
And we'll try to use same
number of basis functions

01:02:38.850 --> 01:02:41.930
as we have our
input instruments.

01:02:41.930 --> 01:02:45.540
So in case we had 50
input instruments,

01:02:45.540 --> 01:02:50.210
we select basis functions
also the number 50.

01:02:50.210 --> 01:02:59.390
So we will use typical
Newton-Raphson approach here.

01:02:59.390 --> 01:03:09.160
We will compute sensitivities
of input of all instruments

01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:14.350
to perturbations of a
volatility surface, OK?

01:03:14.350 --> 01:03:16.310
We'll build this
Jacobian matrix.

01:03:16.310 --> 01:03:28.780
And then, if we made the
reasonable assumptions

01:03:28.780 --> 01:03:35.730
about what those
basis functions are,

01:03:35.730 --> 01:03:39.790
then we can invert
our square Jacobian.

01:03:39.790 --> 01:03:41.680
And again, the reason
why it's square

01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:46.010
is because we selected same
number of basis functions

01:03:46.010 --> 01:03:48.420
as the number of
input instruments.

01:03:48.420 --> 01:03:50.830
It's actually quite
common approach,

01:03:50.830 --> 01:03:55.450
but it's very often
is wrong approach.

01:03:55.450 --> 01:03:56.980
It produces unstable results.

01:03:56.980 --> 01:04:01.110
And we will see why.

01:04:01.110 --> 01:04:03.510
So we converge to
exact solution,

01:04:03.510 --> 01:04:06.850
but now the volatility
surface looks like this.

01:04:06.850 --> 01:04:09.870
It looks less like a
volatility surface,

01:04:09.870 --> 01:04:14.820
but more like Manhattan skyline.

01:04:14.820 --> 01:04:16.530
So you have a Hudson
River here, and you

01:04:16.530 --> 01:04:20.550
have some buildings right?

01:04:20.550 --> 01:04:25.910
Obviously, even though it
calibrates exactly, right?

01:04:25.910 --> 01:04:27.660
And you could go and
price your portfolio,

01:04:27.660 --> 01:04:32.090
but probably prices
for instruments

01:04:32.090 --> 01:04:34.780
in the portfolio
that are not input

01:04:34.780 --> 01:04:38.380
instruments for calibration
would be meaningless.

01:04:38.380 --> 01:04:44.280
Because the reason why we
need this surface to be smooth

01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:47.560
is because for
similar instruments

01:04:47.560 --> 01:04:49.770
for similar products
in your portfolio

01:04:49.770 --> 01:04:51.830
you kind of expect
similar prices, right?

01:04:51.830 --> 01:04:53.770
So if your volatility
jumps, that's

01:04:53.770 --> 01:04:56.490
something that just contradicts
with this assumption.

01:05:00.570 --> 01:05:04.480
So now how can we
improve the situation?

01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:09.420
So we can try to use our
basis functions which

01:05:09.420 --> 01:05:11.590
were selected in terms of
piecewise constant shift

01:05:11.590 --> 01:05:13.130
of different areas.

01:05:13.130 --> 01:05:18.180
We can use a smooth
version of those plans.

01:05:18.180 --> 01:05:22.930
But again, the result
looks better, but still

01:05:22.930 --> 01:05:23.810
is not good enough.

01:05:26.720 --> 01:05:31.380
And just to demonstrate that
this is an ill-posed problem--

01:05:31.380 --> 01:05:33.390
an ill-posed
problem is something

01:05:33.390 --> 01:05:37.370
that small changes
of your inputs

01:05:37.370 --> 01:05:41.000
results in insane
changes in your output.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.640
And this is a typical example.

01:05:43.640 --> 01:05:46.860
So keep all the
instruments the same, OK?

01:05:46.860 --> 01:05:50.350
We just change by 1%--
which is not a big number--

01:05:50.350 --> 01:05:57.850
of the five year by
10 year swaption,

01:05:57.850 --> 01:06:01.360
results in a quite large change
of the volatility surface.

01:06:01.360 --> 01:06:02.910
But look also at
the shape right?

01:06:02.910 --> 01:06:05.650
So it's really kind of
you look at one building

01:06:05.650 --> 01:06:08.370
with an antenna, and
another building, right?

01:06:08.370 --> 01:06:12.660
So it's very unreasonable change
of the volatility surface.

01:06:17.530 --> 01:06:22.070
So we can use ill-posedness
to our advantage.

01:06:22.070 --> 01:06:27.430
So basically, at
this point we say,

01:06:27.430 --> 01:06:30.300
well, it's not a requirement
to calibrate exactly,

01:06:30.300 --> 01:06:32.800
just because every
instruments that

01:06:32.800 --> 01:06:35.750
is an input of collaboration
actually has some tolerance.

01:06:35.750 --> 01:06:38.990
So even there is no point
to calibrate it exactly.

01:06:41.980 --> 01:06:48.830
So because we know that
small variations in inputs

01:06:48.830 --> 01:06:52.010
can be large
variations of outputs,

01:06:52.010 --> 01:06:55.590
we can put some
constraints on the outputs.

01:06:55.590 --> 01:06:57.140
And actually, that
may not cost us

01:06:57.140 --> 01:07:01.130
much in terms of not being
able to calibrate exactly,

01:07:01.130 --> 01:07:09.420
but produce much more
meaningful result.

01:07:09.420 --> 01:07:15.880
And just to be absolutely
sure that our output

01:07:15.880 --> 01:07:20.046
result, our surface
is smooth, we

01:07:20.046 --> 01:07:27.250
can use basis functions that
are smooth to begin with.

01:07:27.250 --> 01:07:30.840
So we'll use B-splines, but
those will be two-dimensional.

01:07:30.840 --> 01:07:34.950
And we'll talk a little
bit more about this.

01:07:34.950 --> 01:07:41.790
And it's not a requirement
for us to have as many basis

01:07:41.790 --> 01:07:46.540
functions as we have
instruments, because we

01:07:46.540 --> 01:07:47.860
can put some other constraints.

01:07:47.860 --> 01:07:50.770
Like, for example, we can
put smoothness or gradient

01:07:50.770 --> 01:07:52.610
smoothness to the surface.

01:07:52.610 --> 01:07:56.970
So let's pick some relatively
high but reasonable number

01:07:56.970 --> 01:07:59.400
of functions-- could be more
than the number of input

01:07:59.400 --> 01:08:01.590
instruments-- and
see what we can do.

01:08:01.590 --> 01:08:03.997
So first of all,
let's build our basis

01:08:03.997 --> 01:08:05.080
functions for the surface.

01:08:05.080 --> 01:08:07.300
So this slide we
already just saw,

01:08:07.300 --> 01:08:13.520
that we selected to
use B-splines, which is

01:08:13.520 --> 01:08:15.630
very convenient to work with.

01:08:15.630 --> 01:08:18.630
This is a one-dimensional.

01:08:18.630 --> 01:08:21.229
This is the way we
build them, typically.

01:08:21.229 --> 01:08:24.830
So we use the Cox-de
Boor recursion formula.

01:08:24.830 --> 01:08:27.430
You start from linear, right?

01:08:27.430 --> 01:08:29.590
Then you apply that formula.

01:08:29.590 --> 01:08:34.370
You transition to the basis
set of the second order.

01:08:34.370 --> 01:08:40.550
And then the next iteration,
you have the third order.

01:08:40.550 --> 01:08:43.370
And those ones will be built.

01:08:43.370 --> 01:08:51.660
So now, if you take those basis
functions in one dimension,

01:08:51.660 --> 01:08:54.890
and same basis functions
in the other dimension,

01:08:54.890 --> 01:08:58.700
and then you compute the
kind of 10s of products,

01:08:58.700 --> 01:09:01.880
like you multiply
them one by one,

01:09:01.880 --> 01:09:05.000
then you get basis functions
with shapes like this.

01:09:11.830 --> 01:09:14.920
Which means that no
matter what we do, right,

01:09:14.920 --> 01:09:19.859
like, because every basis
function makes sense,

01:09:19.859 --> 01:09:23.859
then any linear combinations
will also be good enough.

01:09:23.859 --> 01:09:26.850
So to formulate the
problem is very simple.

01:09:26.850 --> 01:09:31.606
So we're saying, OK, the
quotes produced by our model

01:09:31.606 --> 01:09:33.939
should be close enough to
what's observed in the market,

01:09:33.939 --> 01:09:35.090
with some weights again.

01:09:35.090 --> 01:09:37.060
But we don't require
any more that those

01:09:37.060 --> 01:09:39.779
are calibrated exactly.

01:09:39.779 --> 01:09:44.647
We are going to put some
penalty function to the change

01:09:44.647 --> 01:09:45.730
of the volatility surface.

01:09:49.260 --> 01:09:52.910
And we're going to put
some penalty function

01:09:52.910 --> 01:09:58.620
to the volatility
surface itself.

01:09:58.620 --> 01:10:03.980
So those are vectors, right?

01:10:03.980 --> 01:10:06.890
And L_1 and L_2 are matrices.

01:10:06.890 --> 01:10:11.490
So just to give you an example
what those matrices should be,

01:10:11.490 --> 01:10:16.440
like if you are talking
about smoothness,

01:10:16.440 --> 01:10:20.410
if you want to penalize the
gradient of the vector, right,

01:10:20.410 --> 01:10:25.560
then the matrix will
consist of rows of one

01:10:25.560 --> 01:10:26.840
and following minus 1.

01:10:26.840 --> 01:10:29.490
So what you're
saying, OK, if I want

01:10:29.490 --> 01:10:32.490
to penalize the difference
between this and the next.

01:10:32.490 --> 01:10:35.220
And you do that for
every element, OK?

01:10:35.220 --> 01:10:41.890
And the penalty kind of consists
of all penalties that you have.

01:10:41.890 --> 01:10:51.490
So here we just formulate
our problem right?

01:10:51.490 --> 01:10:57.680
So we want once-- because we've
had the Jacobian-- we want

01:10:57.680 --> 01:11:03.300
to price things close enough.

01:11:03.300 --> 01:11:05.740
And there are two
penalty terms here

01:11:05.740 --> 01:11:11.440
with the different
regularization parameters.

01:11:11.440 --> 01:11:17.020
So once we have this, we can
just, using linear algebra,

01:11:17.020 --> 01:11:20.190
the solution is defined here.

01:11:20.190 --> 01:11:29.130
And this is resulting
calibration, which

01:11:29.130 --> 01:11:31.990
we see is nice and smooth.

01:11:41.440 --> 01:11:46.530
So if we take the analysis
of the calibration inverse

01:11:46.530 --> 01:11:51.060
problem, let's do that
using our linear algebra

01:11:51.060 --> 01:11:54.080
tools to understand where
the problem is coming from.

01:11:54.080 --> 01:12:00.020
OK, so A is a matrix,
translates our model parameters

01:12:00.020 --> 01:12:01.330
to market observables.

01:12:01.330 --> 01:12:05.380
And there is some error
there-- epsilon, OK?

01:12:05.380 --> 01:12:12.620
So you can see
that your solution

01:12:12.620 --> 01:12:19.950
is a linear combination
of singular values divided

01:12:19.950 --> 01:12:21.627
by the singular values, OK?

01:12:21.627 --> 01:12:32.820
So if your values are high,
OK, then that's not a problem.

01:12:32.820 --> 01:12:38.280
The problem is that once you get
very small singular values, OK,

01:12:38.280 --> 01:12:42.770
the deviation of
v_i's can result

01:12:42.770 --> 01:12:45.682
in the large deviation of
your reconstructed result.

01:12:45.682 --> 01:12:47.140
And that's when
you have a problem.

01:12:52.860 --> 01:12:56.020
So this is described
on this slide.

01:12:56.020 --> 01:13:04.840
So "ill-posed" is that small
noise may be significantly

01:13:04.840 --> 01:13:08.360
amplified by small
singular values.

01:13:08.360 --> 01:13:13.700
And if you have a problem when
you don't know how good it is,

01:13:13.700 --> 01:13:15.820
and whether you can
trust it or not,

01:13:15.820 --> 01:13:20.560
so it's a very
standard approach,

01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:23.010
you compute the
condition number,

01:13:23.010 --> 01:13:27.490
which is the ratio of the
maximum to minimum singular

01:13:27.490 --> 01:13:28.550
values.

01:13:28.550 --> 01:13:32.040
And if the number
is high, which means

01:13:32.040 --> 01:13:37.120
that there are some
very insignificant modes

01:13:37.120 --> 01:13:42.000
in your input data that can
cause substantial changes

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:42.680
in your output.

01:13:42.680 --> 01:13:44.730
And if you know that,
it's not comforting right?

01:13:44.730 --> 01:13:48.720
So if that mode actually
doesn't present in reality,

01:13:48.720 --> 01:13:50.216
then that's fine.

01:13:50.216 --> 01:13:51.590
But there is no
guarantee, right?

01:13:51.590 --> 01:13:55.038
See, if that happens, then
your model basically blows up.

01:14:00.150 --> 01:14:06.770
And that slide displays exactly
that noiseless situation,

01:14:06.770 --> 01:14:11.230
where it looks like if
you don't have any noise

01:14:11.230 --> 01:14:14.960
and if your model
is perfect, then

01:14:14.960 --> 01:14:17.000
you're always able
to calibrate exactly

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.350
to the market observables.

01:14:19.350 --> 01:14:21.800
But it's never the case right?

01:14:21.800 --> 01:14:24.760
So there's always
uncertainty to the numbers

01:14:24.760 --> 01:14:27.650
that you're calibrating to.

01:14:27.650 --> 01:14:33.200
And your model is
not always perfect.

01:14:37.700 --> 01:14:44.530
So very standard technique
for that particular problem

01:14:44.530 --> 01:14:48.680
is the Tikhonov
regularization, which,

01:14:48.680 --> 01:14:54.680
when you solve your
ill-posed problem, as trying

01:14:54.680 --> 01:15:01.374
to minimize x minus y, you add
some penalty to the amplitude

01:15:01.374 --> 01:15:03.120
to your solution.

01:15:03.120 --> 01:15:05.620
Which essentially
saying, OK, give me

01:15:05.620 --> 01:15:08.090
something reasonable, but
something that's not blown-up.

01:15:12.040 --> 01:15:19.430
If you go through
this linear algebra,

01:15:19.430 --> 01:15:24.350
to see how that lambda parameter
in the Tikhonov regularization

01:15:24.350 --> 01:15:30.760
affects the weights of the
SVD kind of representation

01:15:30.760 --> 01:15:36.580
of your solution, we now see
that small singular values

01:15:36.580 --> 01:15:39.600
is no longer a problem,
just because we're not

01:15:39.600 --> 01:15:42.840
dividing by the small
number, but actually we

01:15:42.840 --> 01:15:46.041
are kind of limited by some
regularization parameter.

01:15:49.410 --> 01:15:53.470
And typically, when you
apply that regularization,

01:15:53.470 --> 01:15:58.470
your model no longer gives
you a perfect match, right?

01:15:58.470 --> 01:16:02.083
But the result is much more
meaningful, and more stable.

01:16:09.780 --> 01:16:19.060
Another approach
to the problem is--

01:16:19.060 --> 01:16:20.960
and before we go to that slide.

01:16:20.960 --> 01:16:23.790
So kind of Tikhonov
regularization we

01:16:23.790 --> 01:16:29.120
used for surface calibration.

01:16:29.120 --> 01:16:31.060
Here, a standard
Tikhonov regularization

01:16:31.060 --> 01:16:33.840
is something that
you just penalize

01:16:33.840 --> 01:16:35.640
the amplitude of
the solution itself.

01:16:35.640 --> 01:16:37.973
But it doesn't have to be the
amplitude of the solution.

01:16:37.973 --> 01:16:42.290
It can be some linear
combination of your solution.

01:16:42.290 --> 01:16:45.990
And in terms of calibrating
of volatility surface,

01:16:45.990 --> 01:16:49.090
we didn't apply penalty to
the reconstructed volatility,

01:16:49.090 --> 01:16:54.200
but we say it's not that the
amplitude of the solution

01:16:54.200 --> 01:16:55.630
that we don't like.

01:16:55.630 --> 01:16:57.260
We don't like non-smoothness.

01:16:57.260 --> 01:17:00.870
So let's penalize the
derivatives of the surface

01:17:00.870 --> 01:17:02.088
in the different angles.

01:17:07.070 --> 01:17:12.290
Another approach would be to
use a truncated SVD, where

01:17:12.290 --> 01:17:14.810
we say, OK, so we did our
singular value decomposition.

01:17:14.810 --> 01:17:18.610
We're looking at the
spectrum of singular values,

01:17:18.610 --> 01:17:23.790
and we find that some numbers
look nice and large, some very

01:17:23.790 --> 01:17:25.000
small.

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:28.210
And then we just
skip the small ones.

01:17:28.210 --> 01:17:35.220
It's very similar to the
PCA approach for the risk

01:17:35.220 --> 01:17:38.160
management that we
saw before, where

01:17:38.160 --> 01:17:40.900
we just selected five
principal components

01:17:40.900 --> 01:17:42.720
and we ignored the rest.

01:17:42.720 --> 01:17:47.030
As a result, the model
is much more robust.

01:17:47.030 --> 01:17:49.300
And by doing this,
we essentially

01:17:49.300 --> 01:17:51.414
truncate the null
space of the model.

01:17:51.414 --> 01:17:52.830
If you're familiar
with this, it's

01:17:52.830 --> 01:18:05.894
basically the space that has
very small singular values.

01:18:12.670 --> 01:18:21.190
So what regularized models gives
you is that improved stability.

01:18:21.190 --> 01:18:24.125
It's absolutely essential
for ill-conditioned problems.

01:18:28.480 --> 01:18:34.950
And it's a more realistic
and meaningful result

01:18:34.950 --> 01:18:39.860
at the expense of some beauty
to fit exactly the data,

01:18:39.860 --> 01:18:44.940
but that's something that
is quite often acceptable.

01:18:44.940 --> 01:18:47.550
It might cause a
biased solution,

01:18:47.550 --> 01:18:51.510
meaning that your solution
again may not be exact.

01:18:51.510 --> 01:18:55.320
It might be biased towards
some better result.

01:18:55.320 --> 01:19:00.480
For example, if you apply
smoothness constraint,

01:19:00.480 --> 01:19:03.810
the solution would kind
of assume a little bit

01:19:03.810 --> 01:19:06.960
more smooth result
than it actually is.

01:19:06.960 --> 01:19:10.590
But that's acceptable.

01:19:10.590 --> 01:19:15.840
And the bias, again,
can be minimized

01:19:15.840 --> 01:19:20.210
by reasonable selection of
what quantity you actually

01:19:20.210 --> 01:19:21.200
don't like.

01:19:21.200 --> 01:19:23.820
Again, you can say,
oh, during calibration

01:19:23.820 --> 01:19:27.067
of our volatilities of our
surface we could have said,

01:19:27.067 --> 01:19:27.650
you know what?

01:19:27.650 --> 01:19:32.470
Let's just open the textbook and
see what's the regularization.

01:19:32.470 --> 01:19:33.850
OK, we find Tikhonov.

01:19:33.850 --> 01:19:36.040
We start to penalize
the amplitude.

01:19:36.040 --> 01:19:37.890
Then the result won't be good.

01:19:37.890 --> 01:19:40.570
So we need to think
about and say, OK,

01:19:40.570 --> 01:19:42.080
what exactly we don't like.

01:19:42.080 --> 01:19:45.480
Like, for example, is like
absolutely flat volatility

01:19:45.480 --> 01:19:46.760
surface good for us?

01:19:46.760 --> 01:19:49.240
And we'll find, yeah,
that that's actually fine.

01:19:49.240 --> 01:19:52.690
Then, if we said that then
penalizing the amplitude

01:19:52.690 --> 01:19:54.440
doesn't make sense,
so we need to penalize

01:19:54.440 --> 01:19:57.790
something that is a deviation
from that perfect flat

01:19:57.790 --> 01:19:59.030
solution.

01:19:59.030 --> 01:20:02.560
Or to be more kind
of precise, we

01:20:02.560 --> 01:20:07.990
penalize like the derivative
in different directions.

01:20:07.990 --> 01:20:13.540
So this kind of concludes
my presentation today.

01:20:13.540 --> 01:20:18.580
And there are some
useful links if you

01:20:18.580 --> 01:20:22.546
want to get more information.

01:20:25.997 --> 01:20:28.462
Thank you.

01:20:28.462 --> 01:20:29.448
Any question?

01:20:34.880 --> 01:20:35.838
AUDIENCE: Yes.

01:20:35.838 --> 01:20:41.814
So regarding the techniques
that you use for fitting

01:20:41.814 --> 01:20:46.794
function that you are
using spline techniques.

01:20:46.794 --> 01:20:50.480
What other techniques--
is the spline

01:20:50.480 --> 01:20:52.370
the best technique you use?

01:20:56.220 --> 01:20:57.970
IVAN MASYUKOV: Well,
spline is, yes.

01:20:57.970 --> 01:21:01.450
So a spline or
interpolation is the same.

01:21:01.450 --> 01:21:03.350
So we're always talking
about interpolation.

01:21:03.350 --> 01:21:07.080
So you have some limited
number of inputs,

01:21:07.080 --> 01:21:08.560
and you want to draw in between.

01:21:08.560 --> 01:21:11.420
So there are just
two words for this,

01:21:11.420 --> 01:21:15.120
which is a interpolation-- or
spline-- which I consider to be

01:21:15.120 --> 01:21:16.600
the same thing in general.

01:21:26.310 --> 01:21:30.050
AUDIENCE: I have a question
about the interpolation graph

01:21:30.050 --> 01:21:32.525
that you had where the
following was very smooth.

01:21:35.495 --> 01:21:39.046
When you, as an expert in
this, look at that graph

01:21:39.046 --> 01:21:46.090
and see, I guess,
just some odd shapes

01:21:46.090 --> 01:21:53.222
at certain parts of the curve,
how do you interpret that?

01:21:53.222 --> 01:21:56.980
And do you assess that that's
a feature of the current term

01:21:56.980 --> 01:22:00.764
market liquidity conditions, or
possibly just a mathematical--

01:22:00.764 --> 01:22:02.180
IVAN MASYUKOV:
Well, first of all,

01:22:02.180 --> 01:22:09.680
I mean, that grid is done
like for-- every element is

01:22:09.680 --> 01:22:10.685
a three-month.

01:22:10.685 --> 01:22:12.700
But what's traded on the market?

01:22:12.700 --> 01:22:15.620
Like, typical maturities
are three-month,

01:22:15.620 --> 01:22:19.710
maybe half-year, one year,
two year, five year, 10 year.

01:22:19.710 --> 01:22:25.590
So we should kind of rescale
it in a logarithmic scale,

01:22:25.590 --> 01:22:27.920
or-- you know what
I'm talking about?

01:22:27.920 --> 01:22:31.010
And then, if you do
that, then this peak

01:22:31.010 --> 01:22:32.460
doesn't look a peak anymore.

01:22:32.460 --> 01:22:35.450
So the reason why it looks
like a feature to you

01:22:35.450 --> 01:22:39.630
is because it's quite
sharper than this guy, right?

01:22:39.630 --> 01:22:44.990
But that's because you have many
more detailed instruments there

01:22:44.990 --> 01:22:46.060
compared to here.

01:22:49.570 --> 01:22:52.191
And that's the reason why we
selected our basis functions

01:22:52.191 --> 01:22:52.690
like this.

01:22:52.690 --> 01:22:56.890
So we selected more node
density in the front,

01:22:56.890 --> 01:23:01.270
just because there are more
instruments in the front

01:23:01.270 --> 01:23:03.210
than at the end.

01:23:03.210 --> 01:23:08.620
So we want our spline to be
more detailed at the beginning,

01:23:08.620 --> 01:23:12.200
and kind of just nice
and smooth at the end.

01:23:12.200 --> 01:23:16.990
So that's why those basis
functions-- which correspond

01:23:16.990 --> 01:23:20.900
very well to actual instruments
that we have in the portfolio--

01:23:20.900 --> 01:23:25.820
can produce, first of all, you
see this spike here too, right?

01:23:25.820 --> 01:23:30.250
So is it like you can
compare this guy to this guy.

01:23:30.250 --> 01:23:36.010
But essentially, it's just
they have similar magnitude,

01:23:36.010 --> 01:23:39.000
but we don't have enough
instruments in this area

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.720
to support any sharper features.

01:23:41.720 --> 01:23:47.540
So I don't see any
problems with this graph.

01:23:47.540 --> 01:23:52.150
But traders, because they
look at this every day, right?

01:23:52.150 --> 01:23:54.150
And then they calibrate,
and they see a feature,

01:23:54.150 --> 01:23:57.190
and then they immediately
kind of trying to think.

01:23:57.190 --> 01:24:00.920
OK, if you see something that
you know is not typical--

01:24:00.920 --> 01:24:04.110
and that sense of
typical/not typical

01:24:04.110 --> 01:24:07.490
comes with years of
experience-- then they

01:24:07.490 --> 01:24:09.870
try to arbitrage this.

01:24:09.870 --> 01:24:13.840
Because if there is a
spike in the surface,

01:24:13.840 --> 01:24:15.980
it's very likely that
it will disappear soon.

01:24:19.820 --> 01:24:21.260
AUDIENCE: So if
this is the model

01:24:21.260 --> 01:24:26.317
for volatility, that's used in
modeling for swaptions, right?

01:24:26.317 --> 01:24:27.784
IVAN MASYUKOV: Yeah.

01:24:27.784 --> 01:24:29.495
AUDIENCE: So if you
were to actually try

01:24:29.495 --> 01:24:33.163
to go about making a trade
out of some discrepancy

01:24:33.163 --> 01:24:35.363
that you see, can you
kind of describe how

01:24:35.363 --> 01:24:36.815
you'd do that with swaption?

01:24:36.815 --> 01:24:38.564
Do you use basically
like regular options?

01:24:42.547 --> 01:24:44.380
IVAN MASYUKOV: I don't
have the screen here.

01:24:44.380 --> 01:24:50.010
But essentially what
traders do, right?

01:24:50.010 --> 01:24:56.130
So this is, I mean that
calibrator we actually use.

01:24:56.130 --> 01:24:58.400
And it's a real-time calibrator.

01:24:58.400 --> 01:25:00.640
The reason why it
can be real time

01:25:00.640 --> 01:25:04.470
is because there is just
simple linear algebra there.

01:25:04.470 --> 01:25:08.000
Most of stuff like A transpose
A can be pre-calculated.

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:11.500
So it can be real time.

01:25:11.500 --> 01:25:13.920
So they can see this
volatility surface

01:25:13.920 --> 01:25:20.290
moving while-- we connect
to actual market data.

01:25:20.290 --> 01:25:25.230
And once they see there
is anomaly on the market,

01:25:25.230 --> 01:25:27.970
there is something traded
which they believe is wrong,

01:25:27.970 --> 01:25:30.300
OK, they're just make
an advantage of that.

01:25:30.300 --> 01:25:35.000
They just make a trade, that
would be swaption, for example,

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:39.240
or maybe some other trade
more exotic than swaptions.

01:25:39.240 --> 01:25:41.320
But again, having
like the dependence

01:25:41.320 --> 01:25:46.320
on the particular instruments,
which kind of would

01:25:46.320 --> 01:25:48.840
express your position
that this will change

01:25:48.840 --> 01:25:50.290
like in a day or so.

01:25:50.290 --> 01:25:55.660
So that's exactly how
the desk makes money.

01:25:55.660 --> 01:25:58.220
So we call it relative
value analysis.

01:25:58.220 --> 01:26:01.030
So if we have a tool like
that, you have a model.

01:26:01.030 --> 01:26:04.500
You have your input instruments,
and you have some regularizing

01:26:04.500 --> 01:26:06.150
terms of it could
be smoothness, it

01:26:06.150 --> 01:26:09.910
could be a PCA, it could be
combination of PCA, right?

01:26:09.910 --> 01:26:13.200
But then that
additional information

01:26:13.200 --> 01:26:17.410
allows you to find
anomalies in the market.

01:26:17.410 --> 01:26:19.250
Once you find those
anomalies, you

01:26:19.250 --> 01:26:22.670
can take advantage of them--
provided that your model is

01:26:22.670 --> 01:26:24.480
robust enough.

01:26:24.480 --> 01:26:27.970
And if you are saying, well,
I am kind of doing well,

01:26:27.970 --> 01:26:31.350
and I'm calibrate well with
just some smoothness assumption

01:26:31.350 --> 01:26:33.410
about smoothness of
the forward rates,

01:26:33.410 --> 01:26:35.850
there is nothing more
fundamental than this.

01:26:35.850 --> 01:26:41.980
So if your model is based
on fundamental principle,

01:26:41.980 --> 01:26:44.990
you can expect that it will
be more stable in the future,

01:26:44.990 --> 01:26:45.820
rather than PCA.

01:26:45.820 --> 01:26:47.795
Because for PCA, you
just kind of say,

01:26:47.795 --> 01:26:49.590
OK, I took the time interval.

01:26:49.590 --> 01:26:55.090
I kind of did my regression
analysis, whatever.

01:26:55.090 --> 01:26:57.800
But that doesn't mean that
the market will continue

01:26:57.800 --> 01:26:59.400
to do the same in the future.

01:27:02.865 --> 01:27:04.845
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

01:27:04.845 --> 01:27:07.815
[INAUDIBLE] marketer.

01:27:07.815 --> 01:27:10.785
And then we would try to price
the bond at that premium.

01:27:10.785 --> 01:27:14.313
You mentioned that actually bond
is the most liquid instrument

01:27:14.313 --> 01:27:15.260
in the market.

01:27:15.260 --> 01:27:18.383
So why not you do the area
around by inverse bond

01:27:18.383 --> 01:27:22.889
to derive the discounting
factor from a bond [INAUDIBLE].

01:27:22.889 --> 01:27:24.930
IVAN MASYUKOV: Well, that's
a very good question.

01:27:24.930 --> 01:27:30.150
So basically we could
have done that, OK.

01:27:30.150 --> 01:27:33.730
And some firms do that.

01:27:33.730 --> 01:27:36.190
The problem is
that with swaps, we

01:27:36.190 --> 01:27:42.010
kind of have those swaps
today, they kind of

01:27:42.010 --> 01:27:44.560
roll every day, OK?

01:27:44.560 --> 01:27:48.164
They like, the swap today
starts today, swap tomorrow

01:27:48.164 --> 01:27:49.580
starts tomorrow,
things like that.

01:27:49.580 --> 01:27:51.550
But bonds do not.

01:27:51.550 --> 01:27:56.750
OK so they basically, there
is like on-the-run bond, which

01:27:56.750 --> 01:28:00.510
is the most liquid one, which
once the new ten-year bond is

01:28:00.510 --> 01:28:04.060
issued, then that bond
becomes off-the-run.

01:28:04.060 --> 01:28:05.790
It's still traded,
but then everyone

01:28:05.790 --> 01:28:07.800
switches to on-the-run.

01:28:07.800 --> 01:28:13.300
So you don't have a nice
continuous spectrum of bonds.

01:28:13.300 --> 01:28:15.670
You have kind of concentrations
between on-the-runs

01:28:15.670 --> 01:28:17.400
and off-the-runs.

01:28:17.400 --> 01:28:21.960
And if you want to draw
the curve for all of them,

01:28:21.960 --> 01:28:24.990
you typically cannot
do the perfect fit.

01:28:24.990 --> 01:28:29.160
You kind of need to
do the least squares.

01:28:29.160 --> 01:28:33.310
So it's just more convenient
to do it in the swap.

01:28:33.310 --> 01:28:38.730
But once we build the swap
curve, swap trader typically--

01:28:38.730 --> 01:28:41.170
I should say always
use bonds for hedging,

01:28:41.170 --> 01:28:44.080
just because bonds
are much more liquid.

01:28:44.080 --> 01:28:48.220
Then we project bonds
to the swap curve

01:28:48.220 --> 01:28:51.240
rather than swaps to the bond
curve, which is hard to build.

01:28:52.206 --> 01:28:53.977
AUDIENCE: So in
this case, when they

01:28:53.977 --> 01:28:57.036
switch from on-the-run,
off-the-run, [INAUDIBLE]?

01:29:01.069 --> 01:29:01.860
IVAN MASYUKOV: Yes.

01:29:01.860 --> 01:29:05.700
So your curve won't be stable,
just because those roll

01:29:05.700 --> 01:29:09.690
effects-- we call
those "roll effects"--

01:29:09.690 --> 01:29:12.580
which means that there is
something substantial changes

01:29:12.580 --> 01:29:13.170
on the market.

01:29:13.170 --> 01:29:14.900
And there may be
such a big demand

01:29:14.900 --> 01:29:21.650
for this new bond on the market,
that will make your curve, that

01:29:21.650 --> 01:29:23.700
won't look nice.

01:29:23.700 --> 01:29:27.410
So there are also traders
that just trade bonds.

01:29:27.410 --> 01:29:32.470
And those typically
don't have curves.

01:29:32.470 --> 01:29:36.638
They rely on some PCA
models, or some other things.

01:29:39.851 --> 01:29:40.850
PROFESSOR: Thanks again.

01:29:40.850 --> 01:29:42.610
IVAN MASYUKOV: Thank you.

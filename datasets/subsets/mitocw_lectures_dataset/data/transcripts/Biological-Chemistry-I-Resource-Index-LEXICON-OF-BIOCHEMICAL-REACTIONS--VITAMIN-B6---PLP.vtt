JOANNE STUBBE: Hi.

00:00:20.775 --> 00:00:25.190
Today, what we're going to do
is focus on yet another cofactor

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:27.050
that you get out of
your vitamin bottle.

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:32.189
And today we're going to
be looking at vitamin B6.

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:38.240
And vitamin B6 is the cofactor
that you use whenever you

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.340
want to metabolize amino acids.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.400
Where do you get amino acids?

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.750
We all eat proteins.

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.170
The proteins get
degraded to amino acids.

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.750
And we can use the
energy released.

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.380
And trap that energy
to do bio synthesis.

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:58.480
And we use amino acids, convert
them into central metabolism,

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.030
and use them to make
fats, or sugars, depending

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.990
on what the environment is
telling us we need to do.

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.400
So let me introduce
you to this cofactor,

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:16.200
the vitamin itself, as you have
seen now, over and over again,

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.840
is not the actual cofactor.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.410
It's Pyridoxine.

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:22.700
And so that's what you eat
out of the vitamin bottle.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.690
And as in the case of
all vitamins, inside

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:30.110
the cell it has to be
converted into the active form

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.270
of the cofactor.

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.450
And the cofactor we're
going to be talking about,

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:40.580
the active form is Pyridoxal
phosphate, which is called PLP.

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.560
And the structure of pyridoxal--
there two main structures

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.510
of the pyridoxal phosphate
cofactor, one of them

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:52.590
is involved in 80%
of all the chemistry.

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.500
And the one we're going
to talk about today,

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.360
uses both forms of the cofactor.

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.110
That fits into
central metabolism.

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.290
I'll show you how
that fits in a minute.

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:05.260
So pyridoxal phosphate
has this structure.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:09.680
You have a pyridine
ring, the pKa.

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:14.290
The pyridine ring is 6 5, so it
may or may not be protonated.

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.530
And the key part of
the cofactor-- one

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.240
of the key parts of the
cofactor, is this aldehyde.

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.770
So pyridoxal means that
this is an aldehyde.

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:28.050
The second form of the
cofactor is pyridoxamine.

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.040
So this aldehyde
is somehow-- and we

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.900
will look at how
this happens-- is

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.650
converted from this aldehyde,
into an amino group.

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.700
And this is called PMP,
or pyridoxamine phosphate.

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.140
Now the other thing
I wanted to show you,

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:46.890
before we move on
to look at more

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.840
details of pyridoxal
phosphate, is-- while this

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.360
is the form of the vitamin.

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.090
You almost never see this
form inside the cell.

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:02.270
It is always bound in the
active site of the enzyme.

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:05.290
And it binds in the active
site of the enzyme--

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.250
so here's your enzyme--
through the epsilon

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.470
amino group of a lysine.

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.450
So you never really, when
you purify the protein,

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.680
you never isolate the aldehyde.

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.000
So this is the aldehyde.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.080
And I won't draw out all
the rest of the structure,

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.420
but what you have
is an amino group,

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:32.390
that's attached to a lysine, in
the active site of your enzyme.

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.370
And what we're going to
do is convert this ketone

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:36.600
into an imine.

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.010
So this is chemistry you see
over and over and over again.

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.140
You've seen it already
with carbonyl chemistry,

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.100
with carbon-carbon
bond forming reactions,

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:48.370
with peptide bond hydrolysis,
that we've already

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:49.740
talked about.

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:54.140
But what you do is, you're
going to convert this aldehyde

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:55.240
into an imine.

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.380
You need to go through a
tetrahedral intermediate.

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:01.650
And the carbonyl is polarized,
delta plus, delta minus.

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.330
You spend a lot
of time practicing

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:10.430
this kind of chemistry to form
a tetrahedral intermediate.

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:12.630
And I'm going to have
a proton transfer.

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:17.850
So one of the things that's
tricky about this chemistry

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:20.630
is that, if you count
the number of protons

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:23.600
they move around a lot
in the active site.

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:27.300
And the fact is, that you
want to protonate something

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.250
to make it into a
better leaving group,

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:31.050
you want to
deprotonate something

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:33.760
to make it function
more like a nucleophile,

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.080
or as a base, and
nature has figured out

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.210
how to orchestrate all the
residues in the active site

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:41.020
to do this.

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:44.830
In most cases, we don't
understand all of the details.

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.020
And so I'm not going to
focus on proton transfer,

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:49.860
but you're going to see
many proton transfers

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:51.600
within the active site.

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:55.820
So this gives us a tetrahedral
intermediate, or transition

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:56.320
stage.

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.020
You've seen that
over and over again.

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.320
And now what will
happen is that you want

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:04.710
to lose a molecule of water.

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:09.480
So again, you need to pronate
that, and what you form then

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:15.290
is a new carbon doubly
bonded to a nitrogen,

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:17.830
rather than doubly
bonded to the oxygen,

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:20.040
that's covalently
bound to the enzyme.

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:24.150
And so, this is called an imine.

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:27.100
And because it's an
imine of an aldehyde,

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:30.970
it's called an aldimine.

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:35.140
So whenever you isolate
your enzyme, whenever

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:36.990
you isolate your
enzyme, the pyridoxal

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:39.080
is always covalently bound.

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:44.000
OK, so, this bond is
chemically easy to hydrolyze,

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.780
but it's always
covalently bound.

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:46.540
OK.

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:52.520
So what I want to do now, is
make a few generalizations

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:57.560
about pyridoxal, but the first
thing is, that in all cases,

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:02.580
whenever you metabolize-- I want
to metabolize an amino acid.

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:05.670
Pyridoxal phosphate
requiring enzyme

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:08.860
is going to be the key player.

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:09.480
OK.

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:11.050
So here's an amino acid.

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:14.870
OK, here's the alpha
position, the beta position,

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:16.360
and the gamma position.

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:20.740
Well what's so amazing--
I remember first hearing

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:23.780
about this-- is that
you can do chemistry

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:25.690
at all these positions.

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:27.650
And the way nature
figures out how

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:30.500
to do this is by
orchestrating the active site,

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:35.800
with acid based catalyst sitting
around in the right place,

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:38.650
to allow you to do the
chemical transformation

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:41.730
that this protein
has evolved to do.

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:44.100
So let me to show you
what the alpha position,

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:48.760
so this is the alpha position,
you can cleave this bond.

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:51.000
I'll show you how this happens.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.290
You can do all this chemistry
with a few simple chemical

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:59.010
transformations, takes practice,
but once you sort of get

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:01.980
what these
transformations are, it's

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:05.320
amazing what you can get
this cofactor to help you do.

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:07.030
And I'll explain
that in a minute.

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:09.150
So you get cleavage of
the carbon carbon bond

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:13.000
that's loss of CO2 that's
a decarboxylation reaction.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.240
We don't talk about that in
507, but that kind of reaction

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:21.710
generates all of our
neurotransmitters.

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:25.070
You're going to cleave
this carbon-hydrogen bond.

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:28.160
Remember, amino acids are
in the S configuration--

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:30.160
but for example in
cell wall, in bacteria,

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:33.460
they can be either the S
or the R configuration,

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:36.460
so you can cleave that bond,
and put the proton back

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:39.650
on the other face, that's
a racemization reaction.

00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:41.920
You can cleave this
carbon-carbon bond

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:44.134
between the alpha and
the beta position,

00:07:44.134 --> 00:07:46.800
that's a reaction-- remember, we
talked about carbon-carbon bond

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:50.920
formation-- this is the
reverse aldol reaction.

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:53.480
And the one where we're going
to focus on today, which

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:57.690
is the one that fits best
into central metabolism,

00:07:57.690 --> 00:08:02.160
is what happens to this
carbon-nitrogen bond.

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:08.800
So we have an amino
group of our amino acid

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:14.600
is going to get converted
into a ketone group.

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:18.890
So, this group, is going to
get converted into this group.

00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:24.465
And to do that, we're going
to use the imine of pyrodoxial

00:08:24.465 --> 00:08:27.940
phosphate that we have in the
active site of the enzyme.

00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:30.180
So this is sort
of like a carbonyl

00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:32.620
and that's going
to get converted

00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:37.350
into the amine,
the pyridoxamine.

00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:40.390
So these are the two
forms of the cofactor.

00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:42.179
So what are we going
to be focusing on, is

00:08:42.179 --> 00:08:46.180
how this reaction,
actually, happens, and this

00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:49.850
is the most complicated of
all the pyridoxal prostate

00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:51.330
dependent reactions.

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:54.290
So that I'm going to come
back to this in a minute,

00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:59.010
but what I want to do is
make a few generalizations

00:08:59.010 --> 00:09:03.170
about where you're going to see
pyridoxal phosphate chemistry

00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:05.240
in primary metabolism.

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:10.660
So what we're going to
see is that the TCA cycle,

00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:12.980
tricarboxylic acid cycle,
or the Krebs cycle,

00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:13.980
plays a central role.

00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:15.750
It's found in the mitochondria.

00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:17.660
You're going to see this
over and over again,

00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:19.310
over the course of the semester.

00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:21.350
Things feed in and
out of the cycle.

00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:23.690
A cycle means it goes
around and around,

00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:26.640
and if you remove
something from the cycle

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:30.700
and don't put anything back
into the cycle, the cycle stops.

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:32.540
And you're in serious trouble.

00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:36.450
So one way-- one thing--
one way to feed in and out

00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:39.680
of this cycle is
through amino acids.

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:41.590
So this reaction,
which we're going

00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:45.130
to call the transemination,
or a transamination,

00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:47.520
is metabolism of
amino acid, we'll

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:49.060
see into an alpha keto acid.

00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:51.660
So if you look at
the TCA cycle and we

00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:54.760
look at this reaction,
what you'll see

00:09:54.760 --> 00:10:00.250
is you have this compound,
called alpha ketoglutarate.

00:10:00.250 --> 00:10:03.020
OK, so alpha
ketogluterate and that

00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:06.520
going to interconvert
with the amino acid

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:09.100
and so this ketone is
going to be converted

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:13.400
into an amino
group, and so we're

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:17.180
having the amino group
converted into a ketone group.

00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:20.910
And pyridoxial is going to be
converted into pyridoxamine.

00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:25.150
So we're going to have
PLP converted into PMP.

00:10:25.150 --> 00:10:27.420
I'm going to show
you how that works.

00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:31.510
So, if you feed in
glutamate from your diet,

00:10:31.510 --> 00:10:34.550
it-- by this pyridoxal
phosphate dependent reaction--

00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:36.300
can feed into the Krebs cycle.

00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:38.900
If you want to make amino
acids, on the other hand,

00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:41.330
you can suck some of
the alpha keto acid

00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:43.980
out, and convert it
into amino acids.

00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:46.400
And you have to have a way
of controlling whether you

00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:49.690
feed in, or you, actually,
remove your metabolites

00:10:49.690 --> 00:10:50.880
from the cycle.

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:56.000
If you come up here and look at
oxaloacetic and aspartic acid--

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:05.050
So oxaloacetic acid is also
an alpha keto acid, OK.

00:11:05.050 --> 00:11:10.970
And the amino
acid-- can you see?

00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:16.610
I'm probably too close
to the edge-- OK,

00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:18.530
and so here we have
the amino acid.

00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:22.640
So here we have amino acid alpha
keto acid, amino acid alpha

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:23.850
keto acid.

00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:27.290
If you go further up
and go pyruvate feeds

00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:29.540
into the TCA cycle--
pyruvate comes

00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:31.870
from the glycolysis
pathway, which

00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:39.130
again is breakdown of sugars,
pyruvate is an alpha keto acid.

00:11:39.130 --> 00:11:42.330
So this is a CH3, so
this is the simplest,

00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:45.880
and this can get
interconverted into alanine.

00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:54.170
So what you see is this same
theme-- amino group ketone,

00:11:54.170 --> 00:11:55.790
amino group ketone.

00:11:55.790 --> 00:11:57.330
I'm being sloppy, here.

00:11:57.330 --> 00:11:58.980
Most amino groups
are protonated,

00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:01.580
because the pKa, you should
remember, is around 9.

00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:03.500
So they're, mostly,
protonated in solution.

00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:05.760
I should protonate this
over here, as well.

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:09.000
And so you have a ketone
group and amino group.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.410
So this is called
anaplerotic pathways

00:12:13.410 --> 00:12:17.950
where things can feed in and
feed out of central metabolism.

00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:20.610
And this is the only time,
during the course of 507,

00:12:20.610 --> 00:12:23.410
that you're introduced
to amino acids,

00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:24.980
and how they're metabolized.

00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:26.540
So what I want to
do now is then,

00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:30.970
briefly, show you how this
transformation, actually,

00:12:30.970 --> 00:12:31.690
works.

00:12:31.690 --> 00:12:32.790
OK.

00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:35.180
So I'm going to give
you some general rules.

00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:40.090
So the transformation
I just showed you--

00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:43.430
an amino acid into an alpha keto
acid-- looks to be complicated.

00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:46.320
And, I told you, the cofactor
changes its structure

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:50.610
from an imine into
an amino group.

00:12:50.610 --> 00:12:52.360
And the question is,
how does that happen?

00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:56.960
So I want to show you a
bunch of simple, basic rules

00:12:56.960 --> 00:13:01.000
that allow you to think
about all pyridoxal phosphate

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.180
requiring chemistry.

00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:03.894
So I'm going to
write down the rules,

00:13:03.894 --> 00:13:05.310
and then I'm going
to show you how

00:13:05.310 --> 00:13:07.230
it works on the
reactions we were just

00:13:07.230 --> 00:13:09.430
looking at this these
transeminations,

00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:11.960
or transamination reactions.

00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:17.660
So how do we think about the
mechanism of these PLP enzymes?

00:13:17.660 --> 00:13:23.960
So the first thing
is-- the first step

00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:28.920
is-- so you're going to
start out with an imine bound

00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:33.890
to the active site of
your pyridoxal phosphate

00:13:33.890 --> 00:13:35.020
and an amino acid.

00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:38.592
I'll abbreviate it aa.

00:13:38.592 --> 00:13:40.550
And the first thing you
do is, you're going to,

00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:46.670
remove this imine and form a
new imine with the amino acid.

00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:50.120
So that's called a
transimination reaction, OK.

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:59.420
So what we're going to
do is form a new imine.

00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:01.964
And so the imine
from the amino acid,

00:14:01.964 --> 00:14:03.380
and I'll show you
how this happen,

00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:05.480
is going to switch
with this one.

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:09.360
And so what you're left
with, in the active site,

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:12.160
is the amino group
of the lysine.

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:12.790
OK.

00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:15.940
So this lysine--
nature has figured out

00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:20.220
how to minimize the
numbers of acid and base

00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:23.920
groups constrained in the
region, the active site, where

00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:26.790
all the chemistry happens.

00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:32.320
And she uses this lysine, which
initially is holding covalently

00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:34.080
the cofactor, in
the active site.

00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:38.850
She then uses this lysine to
do general acid, general base

00:14:38.850 --> 00:14:39.580
catalysis.

00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:42.150
And she uses it over
and over and over again.

00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:45.840
Now every pyridoxal
enzyme is distinct

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:50.230
and has additional groups
in the active site.

00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:52.095
But we know a lot
about this chemistry.

00:14:52.095 --> 00:14:53.470
We even know what
the groups are,

00:14:53.470 --> 00:14:56.070
but we're going to look and
talk about generalizations.

00:14:56.070 --> 00:14:57.610
So the first thing,
we have to do

00:14:57.610 --> 00:15:00.960
is, we need to free up
our general acid base

00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:05.150
catalyst, lysine, and we
need to covalently bind

00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:08.380
the amino acid, which is a
substrate, into pyridoxal.

00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:09.902
So that's the first step.

00:15:09.902 --> 00:15:11.860
And I'm going to come
back to this in a minute.

00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:14.190
The second step in
all of these reactions

00:15:14.190 --> 00:15:20.990
is-- all amino acids
have an alpha hydrogen,

00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:24.660
that alpha hydrogen
has a very high pKa.

00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:28.190
It's very hard for a normal
amino acid side chain,

00:15:28.190 --> 00:15:30.420
in the active site,
to remove that proton,

00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:32.770
because it's not acidic enough.

00:15:32.770 --> 00:15:35.490
So what I'm going to
show you is pyridoxal

00:15:35.490 --> 00:15:38.580
increases the acidity
of that alpha hydrogen,

00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:41.170
making it easier to
do the chemistry.

00:15:41.170 --> 00:15:44.640
So the second step in almost
all pyridoxal reactions,

00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:50.750
is removal of the
alpha hydrogen.

00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:57.350
And we can do that, because PLP
makes the hydrogen more acidic.

00:15:57.350 --> 00:16:00.920
And I'll show you why
that's true in a minute.

00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:04.540
And then, the third thing is,
once you remove that hydrogen,

00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:07.480
then you get a look at the
chemistry you want to catalyze.

00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:10.350
And we're going to be talking
about this transimination

00:16:10.350 --> 00:16:11.950
transamination reactions.

00:16:11.950 --> 00:16:14.640
But remember I told-- you can
do all this chemistry at alpha,

00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:15.870
beta, gamma.

00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:19.340
So you need to assess
what the substrate is,

00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:22.380
and what the product is, and
then, within the active site,

00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:25.090
you're going to have to
do a lot of manipulation

00:16:25.090 --> 00:16:27.810
with acid and base
catalysts to get you

00:16:27.810 --> 00:16:31.970
into the final stage, where
you can release the product you

00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:33.040
want to release.

00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:35.650
So the last step
in this reaction--

00:16:35.650 --> 00:16:39.940
in all pyridoxal reactions-- so
we do some chemistry in here.

00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:41.760
And I'll show you
what the chemistry is

00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:47.240
with transamination reactions.

00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:50.580
The word transimination
reactions-- now

00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:55.500
I keep saying transamination
and transimination.

00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:58.300
That's because most textbooks
call it transamination,

00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:01.050
because they think about
pyridoxal as the aldehyde.

00:17:01.050 --> 00:17:04.140
But, in reality, pyridoxal
is always in the imine,

00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:05.760
covalently bound.

00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:09.079
And so that's why it's that
transimination, rather than

00:17:09.079 --> 00:17:10.960
a transamination.

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:15.950
So the last step
then, is, hydrolysis.

00:17:15.950 --> 00:17:22.450
And I'll show you how that
happens, or transimination

00:17:22.450 --> 00:17:27.710
to reform this structure.

00:17:27.710 --> 00:17:30.410
So we get ourselves back
to where we started.

00:17:30.410 --> 00:17:33.160
So there's three simple
steps, and in the middle,

00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:35.170
depending on what the
reaction is, you have

00:17:35.170 --> 00:17:37.250
to do additional manipulations.

00:17:37.250 --> 00:17:41.010
But all pyridoxal enzymes
go through these three,

00:17:41.010 --> 00:17:42.260
general steps.

00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:44.730
The first step, I told
you, in all these reactions

00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:46.730
is transimination.

00:17:46.730 --> 00:17:47.260
OK.

00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:53.080
So here's our Schiff-base,
and it's your pyridoxal.

00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:56.480
It's covalently bound to the
lysine in the active site.

00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:59.640
Now one thing that students
often find confusing

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:02.030
is the protonation
state of this imine.

00:18:02.030 --> 00:18:05.630
And that's because it's right
around neutral pH, pH 7.

00:18:05.630 --> 00:18:08.640
So depending on what's
in the active site,

00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:11.370
it could be protonated,
or not protonated,

00:18:11.370 --> 00:18:14.540
if it's protonated of course
it enhances reactivity

00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:15.540
for nucleophilic attack.

00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:17.330
So you want it to be protonated.

00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:20.000
So the active site is
going to manipulate itself

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.370
to put in the protonated state.

00:18:22.370 --> 00:18:26.180
So here you have an
amino acid, and here we

00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:30.490
have a protonated imine, and
so this is the nucleophile,

00:18:30.490 --> 00:18:33.510
and it can attack the
carbon of the imine

00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:36.157
to form a tetrahedral adduct.

00:18:36.157 --> 00:18:37.490
So that's what we're doing here.

00:18:37.490 --> 00:18:42.140
So, this, is going
to attack, this,

00:18:42.140 --> 00:18:44.330
to form this tetrahedral adduct.

00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:45.980
And, you've seen
again, the tetrahedral

00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:48.530
chemistry over again,
when I showed you

00:18:48.530 --> 00:18:51.160
how you formed this
imine in the first place.

00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:54.510
So tetrahedral chemistry,
tetrahedral intermediates,

00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:57.720
transition states, which
collapse to form back

00:18:57.720 --> 00:19:01.010
imines, or carbonyls, happens
over and over, and over again

00:19:01.010 --> 00:19:03.160
in pyridoxal chemistry.

00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:07.680
So now what happens is we have
this tetrahedral intermediate,

00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:11.450
or transition state-- I have
it in parentheses, because it's

00:19:11.450 --> 00:19:14.430
a high energy intermediate,
it doesn't sit around,

00:19:14.430 --> 00:19:15.370
and let us look at it.

00:19:15.370 --> 00:19:16.953
Most of the time you
can never see it.

00:19:16.953 --> 00:19:19.530
It's very high on a
reaction coordinate.

00:19:19.530 --> 00:19:23.260
This, collapses then,
and when it collapses,

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:24.990
what do you generate?

00:19:24.990 --> 00:19:28.510
You generate the lysine
in the active site.

00:19:28.510 --> 00:19:31.010
So now we have
generated a residue

00:19:31.010 --> 00:19:32.560
in the active site
that can function

00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:34.370
as a general acid,
or general base,

00:19:34.370 --> 00:19:39.180
catalysis through the rest of
the chemical transformations.

00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:42.930
And what've we done, is
we've converted this imine

00:19:42.930 --> 00:19:47.690
with lysine, now to an
imine of the amino acid.

00:19:47.690 --> 00:19:53.530
So that's what transimination
is, one imine to another imine.

00:19:53.530 --> 00:19:56.250
The imine that's
covalently bound

00:19:56.250 --> 00:19:59.580
to the protein through
pyridoxal, to an amino acid

00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:00.160
imine.

00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:02.340
OK, so, that's the first step.

00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:05.490
The second step is
that ultimately,

00:20:05.490 --> 00:20:07.790
in almost all pyridoxal
reactions, you

00:20:07.790 --> 00:20:10.880
want to remove this
alpha hydrogen.

00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:14.960
And that alpha hydrogen,
again, is extremely non-acidic

00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:20.580
but by complexing the
amino acid to pyridoxal--

00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:22.720
this is what the
function of the cofactor

00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:28.060
is-- you are enhancing the
acidity of this alpha hydrogen.

00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:31.150
You're making it easier for
a group in the active site,

00:20:31.150 --> 00:20:34.020
a general base
catalyst, like lysine,

00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:42.960
can now pull off this proton
to generate this intermediate.

00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:46.130
Now why is this
hydrogen more acidic?

00:20:46.130 --> 00:20:48.330
Well, if you look
at the structure,

00:20:48.330 --> 00:20:51.480
you can draw all kinds
of resonance structures

00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:54.730
which shows that this
carbanion is more stabilized,

00:20:54.730 --> 00:20:58.210
because it's attached to
the pyridoxal cofactor.

00:20:58.210 --> 00:21:02.520
So if you look at this, you can
draw this resonance structure,

00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:04.990
which is shown here, and you
can draw 20 other resonance

00:21:04.990 --> 00:21:06.220
structures.

00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:10.220
OK, so, the key here is you
can remove the alpha hydrogen,

00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:14.020
because you're
able to delocalize

00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:19.560
these unpaired electrons on this
carbon over the entire system.

00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:22.080
So let me show you
what that looks like.

00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:27.750
So if I draw-- this is called
Dunathan's hypothesis-- so

00:21:27.750 --> 00:21:36.170
here's our pyridine
ring, here's our imine,

00:21:36.170 --> 00:21:39.730
and here's our amino acid.

00:21:39.730 --> 00:21:42.170
Here's the carboxal-- here's
the side chain in our group

00:21:42.170 --> 00:21:44.410
and here's a carboxylate, OK.

00:21:44.410 --> 00:21:47.650
So the idea is, you have like
a benzene ring-- if you haven't

00:21:47.650 --> 00:21:51.150
seen pyridine rings-- but
you have a pi cloud that

00:21:51.150 --> 00:21:54.470
delocalizes-- where these
electrons are completely

00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:56.930
delocalized over the
aromatic ring-- but here,

00:21:56.930 --> 00:22:01.040
you also have a pi cloud
and these things are close

00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:02.890
enough so you can delocalize.

00:22:02.890 --> 00:22:06.040
Now what you're going to do--
and the way nature decides

00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:10.480
what chemistry happens is since
we want to cleave, in this case

00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:12.960
the carbon-hydrogen
bond, she places

00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:17.330
that carbon-hydrogen bond--
by complexing the carboxylate

00:22:17.330 --> 00:22:19.950
and complexing whatever
the R group is--

00:22:19.950 --> 00:22:22.440
she places that
carbon-hydrogen bond

00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:27.930
perpendicular to this plane
of the pi aldimine system.

00:22:27.930 --> 00:22:34.530
So what you're doing then is the
lysine, that we just liberated

00:22:34.530 --> 00:22:37.250
through doing the
transimination reaction,

00:22:37.250 --> 00:22:41.060
you now generate
an empty P orbital

00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:46.010
with unpaired electrons in
it, generate the carbanion

00:22:46.010 --> 00:22:54.440
and now this system can
completely delocalize.

00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:58.960
So, again, this
pyridine ring is planar.

00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:03.630
So you can, completely,
delocalize the electrons

00:23:03.630 --> 00:23:04.810
over this whole system.

00:23:04.810 --> 00:23:07.220
This is a pi cloud.

00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:12.250
And now this is already set up
so that it can delocalize over

00:23:12.250 --> 00:23:13.400
this whole system.

00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:16.070
So what you've done then
is because of the ability

00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:18.410
to stabilize this
carbanion you're

00:23:18.410 --> 00:23:20.810
making that hydrogen
more acidic.

00:23:20.810 --> 00:23:24.355
So if you wanted to say, for
example, cleave-- remember,

00:23:24.355 --> 00:23:25.730
I told you at the
very beginning,

00:23:25.730 --> 00:23:29.380
you might be able to
decarboxylate-- that enzyme,

00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:32.490
would place that
CO2 perpendicular

00:23:32.490 --> 00:23:34.800
to the plane of the
pi aldimine system

00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:38.840
and use the same strategy
to stabilize the resulting

00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:40.700
carbanion intermediate.

00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:44.550
We're not going to talk
about that chemistry in 507.

00:23:44.550 --> 00:23:47.780
So what you've done then--
what the beauty of pyridoxal

00:23:47.780 --> 00:23:50.600
is that she's
increased this acidity,

00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:52.800
and allows you a great
deal of flexibility.

00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:56.930
Because once you generate that
carbanion-- those of you who've

00:23:56.930 --> 00:24:00.130
had 513-- you'll, immediately,
recognize if you have a leaving

00:24:00.130 --> 00:24:03.380
group on a carbon
adjacent to this carbon,

00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:05.010
you can do an
elimination reaction.

00:24:05.010 --> 00:24:09.120
So it sets up a whole
series of transformations.

00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:13.620
For today, were only focusing
on the transimination reaction.

00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:17.340
How do we convert
this to an alpha keto

00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:21.550
acid, and the pyridoxal
to pyridoxamine?

00:24:21.550 --> 00:24:23.350
That's the question
we're asking.

00:24:23.350 --> 00:24:26.510
So we do this chemistry.

00:24:26.510 --> 00:24:29.380
And now what we need to do,
we can use this resonance

00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:32.090
structure, we want to ask the
question, what is the product?

00:24:32.090 --> 00:24:34.820
Well, we want to get
to an alpha keto acid.

00:24:34.820 --> 00:24:37.660
OK, and if you look
at this structure,

00:24:37.660 --> 00:24:42.130
this molecule is an imine
of an alpha keto acid.

00:24:42.130 --> 00:24:45.600
So this is, exactly, the
state we want to be in,

00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:47.210
but then we have
all of this-- we

00:24:47.210 --> 00:24:49.450
have this reactive
intermediate here.

00:24:49.450 --> 00:24:53.060
So what we want to do is
protonate some place here

00:24:53.060 --> 00:24:55.190
to generate this state.

00:24:55.190 --> 00:24:58.460
So that the last step in
all pyridoxal reactions

00:24:58.460 --> 00:24:59.950
is hydrolysis.

00:24:59.950 --> 00:25:02.330
And now we're set up with
the hydrolysis reaction

00:25:02.330 --> 00:25:04.540
to generate the alpha keto acid.

00:25:04.540 --> 00:25:07.010
So, we then want to
ask the question,

00:25:07.010 --> 00:25:08.140
where can we protonate?

00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:10.260
And, so, again, we
have this lysine

00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:13.390
which we now have used
to pull off the alpha

00:25:13.390 --> 00:25:15.250
hydrogen. It's now protonated.

00:25:15.250 --> 00:25:17.790
So now instead of being
a general based catalyst,

00:25:17.790 --> 00:25:21.740
here, it's functioning as
a general acid catalyst.

00:25:21.740 --> 00:25:24.700
And so now what can
happen is you can pick up

00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:30.350
a proton from this lysine, it's
supplying it with that proton,

00:25:30.350 --> 00:25:34.040
to generate this
structure and regenerate

00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:38.240
lysine that can function now
as a general base catalyst.

00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:41.870
So it's toggeling between
general acid and general base

00:25:41.870 --> 00:25:43.140
catalysis.

00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:45.580
And now remember, what
we want to get in the end

00:25:45.580 --> 00:25:49.560
is this pyridoxamine, and we
want this alpha keto acid,

00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:54.770
and now we're set up to rapidly
go to an alpha keto acid.

00:25:54.770 --> 00:25:56.760
Where have you seen
chemistry like this before?

00:25:56.760 --> 00:25:59.000
You've seen it in
the aldolase reaction

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:01.400
that we talked about with
carbon-carbon bond forming

00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:02.670
reactions.

00:26:02.670 --> 00:26:06.860
So the last step in all PLP
dependent transaminations

00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:08.490
is hydrolysis.

00:26:08.490 --> 00:26:13.070
So here we have the lysine
acting as a general base

00:26:13.070 --> 00:26:16.840
to activate water for
a nucleophilic attack

00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:21.960
on this imine, which is
activated to have water add,

00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:25.570
and now you form again, your
tetrahedral transition state.

00:26:25.570 --> 00:26:28.960
I have all of these unstable
species in brackets.

00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:31.680
We really-- sometimes we see
them, sometimes we don't.

00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:33.950
But you have to work
hard to see them.

00:26:33.950 --> 00:26:36.740
And now this simply,
the tetrahedral adduct,

00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:43.590
collapses to form pyridoxamine
and forms the alpha keto acid.

00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:45.660
So that's where
we wanted to get.

00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:51.010
But now what happens, is we're
in the form of the cofactor--

00:26:51.010 --> 00:26:54.570
instead of being in the aldehyde
form we're in the imine form.

00:26:54.570 --> 00:26:57.530
So what we want to
do now is reverse

00:26:57.530 --> 00:27:02.590
this reaction using a
different alpha keto acid,

00:27:02.590 --> 00:27:06.280
and we will generate a
different amino acid.

00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:09.760
So now what can happen-- so
in their pyridoxamine form,

00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:13.360
we then can bind a
different alpha keto acid--

00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:15.500
remember, in the
first slide, I showed

00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:17.760
you three different
alpha keto acids--

00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:19.960
oxaloacetic acid,
alpha-ketoglutarate,

00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:23.770
pyruvate-- you can reverse
this whole process.

00:27:23.770 --> 00:27:36.030
And, in the end, what you end up
with is a different amino acid

00:27:36.030 --> 00:27:40.190
and you regenerate your
imine of pyridoxal.

00:27:40.190 --> 00:27:44.230
So out of all-- the
only pyridoxal phosphate

00:27:44.230 --> 00:27:47.300
requiring enzyme that
goes from the aldehyde,

00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:49.290
or imine, to the
pyridoxamine are

00:27:49.290 --> 00:27:51.470
these transamination reactions.

00:27:51.470 --> 00:27:53.140
And, so, this is the
most complicated.

00:27:53.140 --> 00:27:54.870
Normally, at the
end of your reaction

00:27:54.870 --> 00:27:57.550
you wind up in this state.

00:27:57.550 --> 00:28:00.930
And this probably seems
extremely confusing to most

00:28:00.930 --> 00:28:04.830
of you, but after you solve
three, or four, problems

00:28:04.830 --> 00:28:07.850
where you have to look at
the actual transformations,

00:28:07.850 --> 00:28:12.530
and think about this
tetrahedral chemistry, imines,

00:28:12.530 --> 00:28:15.670
and amino groups, and alpha
keto groups, you will, I think,

00:28:15.670 --> 00:28:19.340
be able to actually
easily see how

00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:24.580
ingenious nature has
been to actually design

00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:25.750
pyridoxal phosphate.

00:28:25.750 --> 00:28:28.100
And, I think, the most
amazing thing, of course,

00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:31.860
is that pyridoxal phosphate
without any enzyme--

00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:35.180
I told you can catalyze
many, many reactions you

00:28:35.180 --> 00:28:37.960
do all the reactions
with the en-- it does it

00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:41.870
spontaneously, at room
temperature, at pH 7.

00:28:41.870 --> 00:28:45.810
What the enzyme does, is only
allows one of these reactions

00:28:45.810 --> 00:28:50.250
by having everything positioned
exactly the right way

00:28:50.250 --> 00:28:51.750
in the active site.

00:28:51.750 --> 00:28:53.830
So this is one of
the cofactors, that I

00:28:53.830 --> 00:28:55.490
thought was
amazingly cool when I

00:28:55.490 --> 00:28:56.900
was in graduate
school, that made

00:28:56.900 --> 00:29:00.360
me want to become a biochemist.

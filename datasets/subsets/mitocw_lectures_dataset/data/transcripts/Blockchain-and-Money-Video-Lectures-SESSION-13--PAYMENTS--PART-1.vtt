00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:29.400
GARY GENSLER: Today we're coming
back to blockchain and money,

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.787
Act Three of this course.

00:00:30.787 --> 00:00:33.120
Now that we've done a little
of the basics, a little bit

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.390
of the economics, and
now it's some use cases

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.250
through the lens of finance.

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.717
And to say something
about one, why

00:00:43.717 --> 00:00:46.300
I thought it'd be worthwhile to
structure the course this way,

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.400
and what I'm hoping
we all get out

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:54.010
of these next 10
or 11 lectures is

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.410
that I thought that it
was important after laying

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:59.260
some foundation of what
blockchain technology might

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.230
or might not be, and
cryptocurrencies,

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.690
and of course, talking
about the economics,

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.200
is to use one field that's the
most dominant field right now

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.840
about potential
blockchain technology

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.000
use, which is finance.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.300
It's not the only
area, but finance is

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.630
completely reliant on ledgers.

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.690
It's completely reliant
on moving property rights

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:25.570
around multiple parties.

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:28.680
And of course,
the first use case

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.970
was about Bitcoin, which
was a peer-to-peer money.

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.610
So I thought even
if you're thinking

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.560
about this in terms
of health care,

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.650
thinking about it terms
of the internet of things,

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:46.540
et cetera, many, many other use
cases, why not take finance.

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.310
Now it also happens to be
my comparative background.

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.760
And I've spent the last three
or four decades of my life

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.290
around finance.

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:58.180
And so I can be most
helpful and dig deep,

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.090
you know, probably
as deep as you

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.850
want to get in the mortgage
market, the payment markets,

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.229
the exchange markets.

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.140
I've probably been there
at some point in my career,

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.360
or still have contacts and
networks and have studied it.

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:19.368
But no doubt, with the 80 of
you in this room, or 90 or so,

00:02:19.368 --> 00:02:20.410
you're going to press me.

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.030
And that I like that.

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:23.800
I will say last
weekend was really

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:30.610
a joy reading 50-plus papers
that it was only about 25

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:35.890
of you that had decided to hand
in papers early in classes 2

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:36.700
through 9.

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.880
But class 10 was 50-plus of you.

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.960
So I really do have
a sense of the class

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:47.530
in terms of what you think
about finance and blockchain.

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.120
Of course, you'll
probably do the same.

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.200
I think I might design it
differently the next time.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.370
But if you all hand in--

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:03.110
if 50 or 60 of you hand in
the papers for class 23,

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:04.350
it will be--

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:05.560
and you have that right.

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.270
I'm not taking that
away from any of you.

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:12.410
But it means I might be delayed
getting back all the projects.

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:16.720
I want to say two or three
other things overall.

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.410
In terms of where we are, we're
halfway through the semester.

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.048
And Sabrina and
Thalita and I did

00:03:22.048 --> 00:03:23.590
a good job of just
saying, how are we

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:24.970
doing on class participation?

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.000
And I've kidded a lot, and I've
joked a lot about who's talked

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.960
and so forth.

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.420
We're down to about 15
of you that have never

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.120
talked in this whole 12--

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.580
so I want to work with you.

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:38.110
I'm not trying to
torture anybody.

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:40.180
And I really want you
to all not to worry

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:41.590
too much about your grades.

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:42.970
I want you to
worry a little bit,

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:45.580
but not too much
about your grades.

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:48.490
But if you've not
spoken yet, and you

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:52.300
haven't gone online-- two people
have gone online, both of whom

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:55.330
I've responded to.

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:56.770
You know, come see me.

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:59.505
Try to figure out how to
be part of this community

00:03:59.505 --> 00:04:00.880
and this discussion,
whether it's

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.160
in class or online in some way.

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:08.680
Cause again, I want this
to be a positive learning

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.570
experience for everybody.

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:13.750
In terms of the papers and
just some overall things,

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:16.779
by and large they were good.

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:20.817
Some were extraordinarily
good, which

00:04:20.817 --> 00:04:22.900
you'd expect with such a
talented group of people.

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:28.090
But some really made me think
and challenged me and so forth.

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:29.380
It is a bell-shaped curve.

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:31.180
Some, on the other hand--

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:33.580
not many-- kind of
missed the mark.

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.570
So I just want to say
a couple of things.

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:39.220
One is, it's not about just
answering the three study

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:40.000
questions.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.390
The study questions are really
to spur the dialogue here.

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:45.250
There's three questions.

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:47.800
Not many of you, but two or
three people just sort of just

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.240
tried to answer those.

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.750
Think about it as a
uniform three-page paper.

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:54.070
Five is the limit.

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:56.650
One or two of you that
did six or seven pages.

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:58.870
That's fine, but it's just--

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:04.210
you don't need to, and it's
more work, in a sense, for us.

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:07.180
Two is, I really did try to
give feedback and comments.

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:09.880
And overall what we're
trying to get to is,

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:12.690
what are the economics here?

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:19.860
What is there about append-only
logs and consensus protocols

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:24.680
amongst multiple parties
writing to a shared ledger?

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:29.410
So multiple parties
updating some state

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:33.110
of economic-- an
economic state, really--

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:36.110
of property rights or something.

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:38.930
And what verification costs,
what networking costs,

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:41.450
could be lowered.

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:44.540
And it's unfair,
because all of you

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:47.300
are going to try to figure
out a final project together.

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:51.800
And I went back over the weekend
looking at the final projects.

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:55.910
I think there's some really neat
ideas that you're looking at.

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:58.490
But at the core is what
verification costs, what

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:00.570
networking costs, can you lower.

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:03.080
Why do append-only
logs consensus

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:08.300
amongst multiple parties
sharing a ledger, and possibly

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:10.535
a native token.

00:06:10.535 --> 00:06:12.410
Because you don't have
to do something around

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:14.000
permissionless native tokens.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.310
But I think some of
you will get there.

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:19.280
And we'll have some
exciting thoughts.

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:21.860
So those were my thoughts.

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:25.230
If I say in the
comments to your paper--

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:27.290
and I only did this
two or three times--

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:29.360
come see me, don't be scared.

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:30.860
It might just be
I want to pursue.

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:33.320
I said this on some
really excellent papers,

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:36.500
and I said this on
one or two that just

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:41.750
I thought it'd be
worthwhile to talk about.

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:44.060
But I'm trying to just get
through this all with you

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:45.470
and have you learn.

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:47.450
So there's just some
overall thoughts

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:49.340
on where we are halfway through.

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:50.510
Post SIP week.

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:54.110
Today we're going to
talk about payments.

00:06:54.110 --> 00:07:01.360
And Thursday we
have a guest, Alin.

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:03.040
If you want to
get mic'd up, I've

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:04.660
got a mic up here
somewhere for you,

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:05.952
cause I'm going to call on you.

00:07:05.952 --> 00:07:08.227
Or you can speak from there.

00:07:08.227 --> 00:07:09.310
ALIN DRAGOS: I'll be loud.

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:10.318
I'll be very loud.

00:07:10.318 --> 00:07:11.110
GARY GENSLER: Yeah.

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:13.415
That's not hard, is it?

00:07:13.415 --> 00:07:14.540
So what are we going to do?

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:18.160
We're going to talk
about just what are we

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:21.520
trying to cover for the
rest of this semester?

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:24.510
Sort of call it H2 in
blockchain and money.

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:28.300
The readings, payment systems,
ledgers, and credit cards.

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:31.680
Just a little bit of
history all together.

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:35.230
And that's when you're
going to meet Alin.

00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:39.940
Not computer science
Alin, but payment Alin.

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:43.960
And we're going to talk
about mobile payments, which

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:46.870
is a very significant
change all the way

00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:50.290
around the globe in payments.

00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:53.690
Then global and US
payments statistics.

00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:56.530
Bitcoin and blockchain
we're going to come back to.

00:07:56.530 --> 00:07:57.520
And then conclusion.

00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:59.650
And remember, whether
it's this week, next week,

00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:01.360
or the following
week, this is all just

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:02.800
to sort of say, well, wait.

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:05.560
What are these use cases
tell us about blockchain?

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:09.370
What are these use cases tell
us about cryptocurrencies?

00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:12.820
My goal isn't that everybody
here is an expert in payment.

00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:16.180
But if your final project
is around the payment space,

00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:19.030
or if you ultimately want
to go along and become

00:08:19.030 --> 00:08:21.760
an entrepreneur and do something
successful in this space,

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:26.450
hopefully these two lectures
today and Thursday will help.

00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:30.190
And I can't remember
exactly what next week is.

00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:32.500
Next week's central bank
and commercial banking.

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:35.679
So next week we're going
to turn to central bank

00:08:35.679 --> 00:08:38.590
digital currency and
what's going on in Sweden,

00:08:38.590 --> 00:08:40.990
and why the e-krona
project's interesting,

00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:43.760
but how's Canada looking at it
through their Jasper project?

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:45.430
What's China kind
of thinking about

00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:48.550
and why they're a little
worried about this space?

00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:51.130
And yes, what's the
private sector doing

00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:53.380
around stable value tokens?

00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:55.360
So you have sort
of a similar thing

00:08:55.360 --> 00:09:00.920
coming both from central banks
and from the private sector.

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:04.480
I just came from a meeting where
one of Larry's colleagues--

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:06.227
he's from the Harvard
Business School--

00:09:06.227 --> 00:09:07.810
a professor at Harvard
Business School

00:09:07.810 --> 00:09:12.300
came over because he's got a
stable value token project.

00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:15.770
And so that's kind of next week.

00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:19.010
We're then going to go
and talk about ICOs.

00:09:19.010 --> 00:09:21.010
You couldn't do a course
in blockchain and money

00:09:21.010 --> 00:09:22.927
if we didn't talk about
initial coin offerings

00:09:22.927 --> 00:09:27.310
with, of course, $25 or $30
billion that's been raised.

00:09:27.310 --> 00:09:31.690
It's an enormous crowdfunding
opportunity for any of you

00:09:31.690 --> 00:09:35.110
that want to be venture
and entrepreneurial

00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:36.400
after this course.

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:38.710
But it's an
important, also, test.

00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:43.660
Are there attributes of
certain economies where

00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:45.540
native token is appropriate?

00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:51.670
It will spur as an
incentive function.

00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:53.660
I'm not willing to give up.

00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:55.960
I know some of you
are minimalist.

00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:59.950
I'm still thinking of
the Skins and the gamers.

00:09:59.950 --> 00:10:04.570
Larry, when you weren't here we
identified our most avid gamers

00:10:04.570 --> 00:10:06.650
in the class.

00:10:06.650 --> 00:10:10.450
And so we always refer to
Skins, Shields, and Swords

00:10:10.450 --> 00:10:15.310
as a form of native token
in the gaming sites.

00:10:15.310 --> 00:10:19.150
But where there might be
economics-- token economics.

00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:21.010
So we'll sort of turn to that.

00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:23.020
On the 15th of
November we've got

00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:26.950
a couple of guests in Jeff
Sprecher and Kelly Loeffler,

00:10:26.950 --> 00:10:30.400
who run the Intercontinental
Exchange and the New York Stock

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:35.140
Exchange and others, but have
real live payments and crypto

00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:37.180
exchange.

00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:38.350
We're going to turn--

00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:39.383
oh-- I'm sorry.

00:10:39.383 --> 00:10:40.300
I got it out of order.

00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:45.760
Primary markets, ICOs is
before and after Thanksgiving,

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:46.930
I guess.

00:10:46.930 --> 00:10:49.510
And then do a little of
the back office side.

00:10:49.510 --> 00:10:52.090
The back of a side is
clearing and settlement.

00:10:52.090 --> 00:10:54.140
I mean, why is the
Australian stock exchange

00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:55.870
using a permissioned system?

00:10:55.870 --> 00:10:57.880
Might you use something else?

00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:00.970
Why is the international
swap and dealer association

00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:04.930
using smart contracts now
to try to rationalize a lot

00:11:04.930 --> 00:11:06.830
of their payment flows?

00:11:06.830 --> 00:11:09.280
So we'll get to real
live use cases that

00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:12.220
are happening around
smart contracts

00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:14.630
and permissioned
clearing systems.

00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:16.690
A little bit of trade
finance, digital ID.

00:11:16.690 --> 00:11:18.890
I know at least one
group is doing some--

00:11:18.890 --> 00:11:22.600
one of the groups here is
doing something on digital ID.

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:24.370
So you'll be out ahead of us.

00:11:24.370 --> 00:11:31.590
So that's kind of a
review of H2 for us.

00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:34.050
So we had a bunch of readings.

00:11:34.050 --> 00:11:35.492
Some of them were quite short.

00:11:35.492 --> 00:11:37.200
I don't know, because
you're on sip week,

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:39.780
whether you were able
to go through them.

00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:45.330
But maybe I should
just ask, does anybody

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:48.490
want to tell me about some of
the major trends in payments?

00:11:48.490 --> 00:11:50.880
I don't know how sleepy
everybody is or whether--

00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:56.220
Priya, I saw your hand, or
you were scratching your nose.

00:11:56.220 --> 00:11:57.512
AUDIENCE: Either ways, I'll go.

00:11:57.512 --> 00:11:58.720
GARY GENSLER: All right.

00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:03.360
AUDIENCE: So digital
wallets is a big thing now.

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:07.723
All the articles acknowledge
how kind of [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:07.723 --> 00:12:09.390
according to what you
see in China where

00:12:09.390 --> 00:12:11.510
you have a digital wallet,
and you pay directly,

00:12:11.510 --> 00:12:13.370
cutting out all the
intermediaries that we

00:12:13.370 --> 00:12:14.120
can't [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:16.520
GARY GENSLER: So
one big, big trend.

00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:18.930
I mean, I've got a bunch
of discussion on this,

00:12:18.930 --> 00:12:19.940
but let's identify them.

00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:21.650
Digital wallets
or mobile wallets.

00:12:21.650 --> 00:12:23.180
What other big trend?

00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:25.380
AUDIENCE: Person to person
payments, so like, Venmo,

00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:28.210
Apple Pay, Cash.

00:12:28.210 --> 00:12:29.730
GARY GENSLER: And Zelle.

00:12:29.730 --> 00:12:30.230
All right.

00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:32.210
So person to person payments.

00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:33.440
Stephanie.

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:35.840
AUDIENCE: Tokenization,
like in Apple Pay, the way

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:38.893
you, like, transform your
credit card data into a token.

00:12:38.893 --> 00:12:41.060
GARY GENSLER: So tokenization
where you can actually

00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:47.820
transform your identity into
a token, in essence, right?

00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:48.320
Chris.

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:50.100
AUDIENCE: There's a
lot of social aspects

00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:51.830
of payments going on.

00:12:51.830 --> 00:12:55.350
Like, for example, in
China there's WeChat.

00:12:55.350 --> 00:12:59.300
They have spending millions of
dollars on these red envelopes

00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:00.560
that used to always be cash.

00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:04.350
And people spend hours during
the new year sending these

00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:06.780
back and forth to each other.

00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:09.520
GARY GENSLER: So you're calling
it socialization of payments,

00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:10.330
so to speak.

00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:10.830
Any others?

00:13:10.830 --> 00:13:11.840
Jeff.

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:12.870
AUDIENCE: Biometrics.

00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:14.100
GARY GENSLER: Biometrics.

00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:15.570
Absolutely.

00:13:15.570 --> 00:13:19.470
So it's sort of another trend.

00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:21.180
So lots going on.

00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:22.263
I'm sorry.

00:13:22.263 --> 00:13:24.180
AUDIENCE: I'm going to
mention one other thing

00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:26.730
that caught my eye
on the statistics

00:13:26.730 --> 00:13:28.170
was that the larger--

00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:31.230
so checks, the number
of checks is going down,

00:13:31.230 --> 00:13:33.450
but the value is up slightly.

00:13:33.450 --> 00:13:36.720
So it seems to me that
the remote payment

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:38.970
or digital payment
is not capturing

00:13:38.970 --> 00:13:42.167
the values of payments of
over $1,000 or [INAUDIBLE]..

00:13:42.167 --> 00:13:43.000
GARY GENSLER: Right.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:48.840
And I think part of that is
because for small values,

00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:52.470
by and large, few of
us use checks anymore.

00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:53.220
In fact, I'll ask.

00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:55.890
How many in this
room has written

00:13:55.890 --> 00:14:00.230
a physical-- any written
check in the last month?

00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:01.050
OK.

00:14:01.050 --> 00:14:03.660
But how many has
written a physical check

00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:06.580
for less than $100?

00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:07.080
All right.

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:08.970
Some.

00:14:08.970 --> 00:14:11.550
I can't even remember the last
time I wrote a physical check

00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:13.150
for less than $100.

00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:13.650
Priya.

00:14:13.650 --> 00:14:15.510
AUDIENCE: If you have
a child in schools,

00:14:15.510 --> 00:14:17.750
and schools do field
trips and everything--

00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:19.500
GARY GENSLER: Oh, this
was not a judgment.

00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:21.200
I wasn't trying to--

00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:22.440
oh, Priya, I'm sorry.

00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:31.770
But I think we tend to
write them for larger.

00:14:31.770 --> 00:14:34.320
Rent checks sometimes,
even though I now

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:37.720
pay my rent online.

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:38.220
Yes.

00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:42.800
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
like Ripple and Chain.

00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:44.450
GARY GENSLER: So
one more change.

00:14:44.450 --> 00:14:45.800
You said Ripple and who?

00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:46.480
AUDIENCE: Chain.

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:48.090
Chain.

00:14:48.090 --> 00:14:48.590
Chaining?

00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:49.670
GARY GENSLER: Chaning.

00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:50.995
And are those really live?

00:14:50.995 --> 00:14:52.370
Or you're saying
those are things

00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:53.530
that are going to happen?

00:14:53.530 --> 00:14:57.250
AUDIENCE: Well, Ripple is live,
especially in Japan and Korea,

00:14:57.250 --> 00:14:58.090
[INAUDIBLE].

00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:04.390
GARY GENSLER: So then what sort
of lessons can people draw?

00:15:04.390 --> 00:15:07.270
We're going to talk a little
bit more about M-Pesa and Alipay

00:15:07.270 --> 00:15:08.950
and so forth.

00:15:08.950 --> 00:15:10.040
But what lessons?

00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:10.540
Kelly.

00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:12.915
AUDIENCE: The thing that I
took from quite a few of them.

00:15:12.915 --> 00:15:16.150
And I liked [INAUDIBLE] article,
because it's sort of like, you

00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:18.480
mentioned the trend in China.

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:20.650
It took trends from
separate countries

00:15:20.650 --> 00:15:23.080
and sort of identified
their own statistics.

00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:25.450
You saw a lot of
countries that people

00:15:25.450 --> 00:15:29.890
don't feel that their payment
data or their payment identity

00:15:29.890 --> 00:15:32.917
is secure on a lot of
mobile and digital devices.

00:15:32.917 --> 00:15:34.750
And that lack of security
if preventing them

00:15:34.750 --> 00:15:38.237
from entering the
digital retail space.

00:15:38.237 --> 00:15:40.570
GARY GENSLER: How many people
looked at it that Worldpay

00:15:40.570 --> 00:15:44.120
article, read your own country,
and said, I didn't know that.

00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:47.620
Like, there was something-- it
was just one page per country.

00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:49.960
So, of course, it
didn't say that much.

00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:52.420
But.

00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:53.582
Alpha?

00:15:53.582 --> 00:15:55.540
I don't remember, was
there a page on Ethiopia?

00:15:55.540 --> 00:15:56.900
AUDIENCE: There
wasn't, unfortunately.

00:15:56.900 --> 00:15:57.410
No.

00:15:57.410 --> 00:15:58.660
Not yet.

00:15:58.660 --> 00:16:01.820
But on M-Pesa, you know, the
big success story in Kenya,

00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:03.070
they've done a tremendous job.

00:16:03.070 --> 00:16:04.445
And it's billed
as a huge success

00:16:04.445 --> 00:16:07.950
at getting mobile payments and
wallet [INAUDIBLE] distributed.

00:16:07.950 --> 00:16:09.730
But it's interesting
to note that they're

00:16:09.730 --> 00:16:11.560
able to acquire
customers by partnering

00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:13.625
with visible networks of agents.

00:16:13.625 --> 00:16:15.250
And again, something
that going forward

00:16:15.250 --> 00:16:17.710
for a lot of these companies,
we have to be [INAUDIBLE]..

00:16:17.710 --> 00:16:19.360
You can't be completely
decentralized

00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:20.518
or completely automated.

00:16:20.518 --> 00:16:21.310
That's [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:21.310 --> 00:16:25.330
GARY GENSLER: I mean, initially,
M-Pesa, which is in Kenya,

00:16:25.330 --> 00:16:26.630
and you had a reading on it.

00:16:26.630 --> 00:16:31.240
But it came out of mobile phones
and that the values stored

00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:35.650
on mobile phones for mobile
minutes people were trading,

00:16:35.650 --> 00:16:36.940
in essence.

00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:46.000
So the network of users
were these shops in Kenya

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.990
where you could go
and get your minutes.

00:16:50.990 --> 00:16:51.490
Jihee.

00:16:51.490 --> 00:16:53.800
AUDIENCE: Kind of going
along with that M-Pesa,

00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:56.140
in addition to basically,
like, in an easy--

00:16:56.140 --> 00:17:00.280
I mean, convenient and lower
transaction costs, like M-Pesa,

00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:03.440
for example, were
very instrumental

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:05.680
in corruption cases
and like, keep

00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:08.190
letting people know that
kind of basically cutting

00:17:08.190 --> 00:17:08.977
the corruption.

00:17:08.977 --> 00:17:09.810
GARY GENSLER: Right.

00:17:09.810 --> 00:17:12.400
There was the example
in Afghanistan.

00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:14.480
Does anybody remember
that from the reading?

00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:16.510
The police officers
all of a sudden

00:17:16.510 --> 00:17:20.470
realized that they got a 30%
pay increase when the government

00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:22.270
was paying them directly.

00:17:22.270 --> 00:17:24.640
But it was actually they
didn't get a pay increase.

00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:27.550
It was like cutting out
the middle man or middle

00:17:27.550 --> 00:17:30.180
woman of corruption.

00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:31.930
I was going to say
gender neutral.

00:17:31.930 --> 00:17:33.740
But whomever was the--

00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:35.440
it was probably men.

00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:41.020
But in that case,
in Afghanistan.

00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:42.520
And then what
challenges are there

00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:43.880
in the cross-border payment?

00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:46.540
Well, I probably
got 50% of the class

00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:49.180
that has personal challenges
with cross-border payments.

00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:51.772
But what would be the
biggest challenges

00:17:51.772 --> 00:17:53.980
that you took from the
readings or your personal life

00:17:53.980 --> 00:17:55.850
in cross-border payments?

00:17:55.850 --> 00:17:56.350
Anyone?

00:17:59.153 --> 00:18:01.570
AUDIENCE: I'll say the number
of [INAUDIBLE] from you that

00:18:01.570 --> 00:18:03.640
the payment service
providers to the other end,

00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:07.090
there are just so many layers,
which was just incredible how

00:18:07.090 --> 00:18:10.690
money can move seemingly so easy
from one country to another--

00:18:10.690 --> 00:18:13.240
GARY GENSLER: So a lot of
layers of intermediation,

00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:14.133
tons of them.

00:18:14.133 --> 00:18:15.550
Anything else in
the cross-border?

00:18:15.550 --> 00:18:16.990
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:16.990 --> 00:18:18.760
GARY GENSLER: Costs.

00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:21.635
You've probably had that.

00:18:21.635 --> 00:18:23.010
So let's go through
a little bit.

00:18:23.010 --> 00:18:25.938
So, I'm introducing a guest.

00:18:25.938 --> 00:18:26.480
There you go.

00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:28.420
You want to stand up?

00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:30.980
[APPLAUSE]

00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:35.560
So Alin , he heads part of the
digital currency initiative

00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:38.220
here at MIT in the Media Lab.

00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:42.590
All the efforts around
lightning network and layer two

00:18:42.590 --> 00:18:43.190
solutions.

00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:46.150
But before MIT, he was a
vice president of First Data.

00:18:46.150 --> 00:18:50.270
And First Data is a
payment system provider.

00:18:50.270 --> 00:18:52.640
And he had about
200 people reporting

00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:56.170
to him and a big business--

00:18:56.170 --> 00:18:59.540
$200 million P&L.
That's revenues, right?

00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:00.350
Yeah.

00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:03.660
I mean, if it was profits,
even better for you.

00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:06.530
And then he spent three
years in a startup world.

00:19:06.530 --> 00:19:09.380
So he's somebody if you're
interested in blockchain

00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:12.120
and digital currency initiative,
you should get to know anyway.

00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:14.840
But if you're even interested
in startups outside

00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:17.480
of payment world, Alin's great.

00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:19.430
And he's going to be
here today and Thursday.

00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:22.120
And not only when
I make mistakes,

00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:23.870
but a couple of times
I'm going to get you

00:19:23.870 --> 00:19:26.270
up here to say stuff about
how payments really works.

00:19:26.270 --> 00:19:32.330
But he's like, way embedded in
the MIT blockchain community.

00:19:32.330 --> 00:19:33.560
So payment systems.

00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:37.050
Again, what is a payment system?

00:19:37.050 --> 00:19:38.960
It is moving money, of course.

00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:42.470
But on some level it is
a way to amend and record

00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:44.330
entries on ledgers.

00:19:44.330 --> 00:19:48.140
Because a ledger is
how we keep money now.

00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:49.820
Certainly in the
digital world it's

00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:53.120
always recorded on
some ledger somewhere.

00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:55.980
So there is an
authorization phase.

00:19:55.980 --> 00:19:59.270
There's a clearing phase,
and then final settlement.

00:19:59.270 --> 00:20:01.430
Does anybody want to take
a crack other than Alin

00:20:01.430 --> 00:20:04.670
as to what it means to
authorize a payment?

00:20:04.670 --> 00:20:06.225
Just to authorize a payment.

00:20:06.225 --> 00:20:07.850
It might not have
been in the readings,

00:20:07.850 --> 00:20:12.200
but it's sort of just
use your language

00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:14.810
skills to tell me what it might
mean to authorize a payment.

00:20:14.810 --> 00:20:15.830
Tom.

00:20:15.830 --> 00:20:17.690
Your laugh gets you called on.

00:20:17.690 --> 00:20:19.430
AUDIENCE: I am
struggling to describe it

00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:21.480
without using the
word to authorize.

00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:23.480
GARY GENSLER: It reminds
me of when I was, like,

00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:26.135
a freshman in English class
at University of Pennsylvania,

00:20:26.135 --> 00:20:28.940
and I had to describe a
telephone without using

00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:31.460
the word "telephone."

00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:34.933
AUDIENCE: So I was thinking
about the digital system

00:20:34.933 --> 00:20:35.850
we're using right now.

00:20:35.850 --> 00:20:37.990
It's like, when you
click Send on Venmo,

00:20:37.990 --> 00:20:42.860
like, you authorize the account,
the money to leave your ledger

00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:43.400
[INAUDIBLE].

00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:45.525
GARY GENSLER: So you just
used the word "authorize"

00:20:45.525 --> 00:20:48.800
to define the word "authorize."

00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:49.750
AUDIENCE: Is it just--

00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:50.600
GARY GENSLER: Oh, back here.

00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:52.220
I'm sorry, I don't
remember your name.

00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:52.590
What's that?

00:20:52.590 --> 00:20:53.160
AUDIENCE: Dan.

00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:53.690
GARY GENSLER: Dan.

00:20:53.690 --> 00:20:54.315
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:20:54.315 --> 00:20:58.880
I just think it's you're
approving the actual transfer

00:20:58.880 --> 00:20:59.540
of the money.

00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:01.250
You're saying it's OK that the--

00:21:01.250 --> 00:21:02.083
GARY GENSLER: Right.

00:21:02.083 --> 00:21:04.683
[INAUDIBLE] I can't--

00:21:04.683 --> 00:21:05.350
AUDIENCE: Aviva.

00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:06.183
GARY GENSLER: Aviva.

00:21:06.183 --> 00:21:07.310
Good to see you.

00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:10.640
AUDIENCE: It has to
do also with KYC AML

00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:14.510
And to authorize the source of--

00:21:14.510 --> 00:21:17.120
the sender's identity and the
source of money, what countries

00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:18.290
it's coming from.

00:21:18.290 --> 00:21:21.530
If it's above a certain
threshold or a certain amount,

00:21:21.530 --> 00:21:25.380
financial institutions
have further checks to--

00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:28.700
GARY GENSLER: So most systems
do what Aviva and Dan said.

00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:33.410
They have to say, we
know who the person is.

00:21:33.410 --> 00:21:39.010
They have the balance
is in some account.

00:21:39.010 --> 00:21:40.800
So they are who
they say they are,

00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:42.640
or at least digitally
they are, and they

00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:46.630
have a certain set of balances
and monies within an account.

00:21:46.630 --> 00:21:51.100
And they have the legal
ability to move that money,

00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:55.240
all without using the word
"authority" in essence.

00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:56.350
Clearing.

00:21:56.350 --> 00:21:57.700
Anybody know what clearing is?

00:21:57.700 --> 00:22:00.780
Or am I going to
have to call on Alin?

00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:01.525
James.

00:22:01.525 --> 00:22:04.890
AUDIENCE: Isn't the [INAUDIBLE]
that confirms that money,

00:22:04.890 --> 00:22:07.090
it's getting somewhere,
and it's going somewhere.

00:22:07.090 --> 00:22:07.882
GARY GENSLER: Yeah.

00:22:07.882 --> 00:22:09.960
And it also has to do
with netting, sometimes.

00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:13.470
Clearing can be-- if the
100 people in this room

00:22:13.470 --> 00:22:17.160
were all sending 10,000
movements all in the same day

00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:19.500
at the end of the day,
you might net all of those

00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:24.000
movements down so there's
fewer actual movements.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:27.240
So historic clearing,
which goes back centuries,

00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:32.160
was also a way to
lower the friction,

00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:34.260
just taking the 100
people in this room,

00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:36.310
of all those movements.

00:22:36.310 --> 00:22:38.555
So authorization-- Aviva.

00:22:38.555 --> 00:22:41.520
AUDIENCE: It also has to
do with foreign exchange.

00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:46.055
So if someone wants to
transact in peso versus dollar,

00:22:46.055 --> 00:22:48.870
so you then also have to
net off, like you said,

00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:49.577
that balance.

00:22:49.577 --> 00:22:50.410
GARY GENSLER: Right.

00:22:50.410 --> 00:22:54.720
So in foreign exchange,
any circumstance--

00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:56.700
and this is in the
securities world as well--

00:22:56.700 --> 00:22:59.430
you'll hear the words
"clearing" and "settling.".

00:22:59.430 --> 00:23:01.920
God knows, even when I was
chairing the Commodity Futures

00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:04.500
Trading Commission,
all of us sometimes

00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:07.530
got a little bit confused
about the two words.

00:23:07.530 --> 00:23:09.990
But clearing is pre-settlement.

00:23:09.990 --> 00:23:13.080
Clearing is netting
of transactions,

00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:16.710
arranging the paper when we
were still in a paper world,

00:23:16.710 --> 00:23:20.940
all in together, taking
all the physical checks

00:23:20.940 --> 00:23:24.340
and getting them all in the
same place in the right place.

00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:27.150
And then what's settlement?

00:23:27.150 --> 00:23:27.650
Sean.

00:23:27.650 --> 00:23:30.066
AUDIENCE: It's to discharge.

00:23:30.066 --> 00:23:31.680
GARY GENSLER: To discharge.

00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:32.320
I like that.

00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:33.070
AUDIENCE: Receipt.

00:23:33.070 --> 00:23:35.570
It's the receipt
from [INAUDIBLE]..

00:23:35.570 --> 00:23:39.440
GARY GENSLER: So
discharge the receipt.

00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:43.430
It's basically the final
amendment of a record.

00:23:43.430 --> 00:23:48.740
It's changing a balance
from 10 to 11 or 10 to 9.

00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:49.730
That's settlement.

00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:51.240
And that's true in securities.

00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:52.230
Alin.

00:23:52.230 --> 00:23:53.730
AUDIENCE: To me
this is mesmerizing,

00:23:53.730 --> 00:23:55.105
because there has
to be a history

00:23:55.105 --> 00:23:58.080
behind this authorized
clearing and settlement

00:23:58.080 --> 00:24:00.640
sort of free part
movement of money.

00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:02.655
Because if you think
of a computer system,

00:24:02.655 --> 00:24:04.530
or if you think of a
blockchain, if you want,

00:24:04.530 --> 00:24:05.980
there's no need
to do any of this.

00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:06.480
Right?

00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:08.640
You just do the damn
transaction, and it's atomic.

00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:11.100
A moves money to
B, and you're done.

00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:13.590
So like, how did
this even happen?

00:24:13.590 --> 00:24:14.670
Like, how do we--

00:24:14.670 --> 00:24:18.060
like, to have a computer system
that does this is just inane.

00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:20.340
You don't need any of
this in a computer system.

00:24:20.340 --> 00:24:22.500
So why do we still do
this in a computer system?

00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:23.940
Where did this evolve from?

00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:26.700
GARY GENSLER: So
Alin's question,

00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:29.428
I was hoping would
come out of the group.

00:24:29.428 --> 00:24:30.970
So I'm going to go
to the other Alin.

00:24:30.970 --> 00:24:35.760
But there's centuries of
history as to why we have these.

00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:36.612
But this Alin.

00:24:36.612 --> 00:24:38.820
ALIN DRAGOS: Let me say
right here, because I think--

00:24:38.820 --> 00:24:41.132
so first of all, I'm
happy that this came up,

00:24:41.132 --> 00:24:42.090
because it's excellent.

00:24:42.090 --> 00:24:42.590
Right?

00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:45.530
So when I saw the
slides, you know, I--

00:24:45.530 --> 00:24:48.522
GARY GENSLER: I sent this
Alin the slides last night.

00:24:48.522 --> 00:24:49.980
ALIN DRAGOS: So I
saw that there is

00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:53.100
a really interesting historical
component to all of this,

00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:55.020
as you rightly
pointed out, right.

00:24:55.020 --> 00:24:59.460
This all came from about four
decades' worth of evolution

00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:00.090
here.

00:25:00.090 --> 00:25:01.800
So we started-- you
know, you started

00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:05.850
with a very convoluted way,
as it would appear now,

00:25:05.850 --> 00:25:08.160
to actually send out
paper-based receipts

00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:12.090
and have a plastic-based
card, if you will,

00:25:12.090 --> 00:25:14.960
that will have to be recorded
and, you know-- first of all,

00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:17.400
you just say, does the
person have the money there?

00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:18.000
Right.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:18.820
Is the money there?

00:25:18.820 --> 00:25:19.650
I'm [INAUDIBLE] authorize.

00:25:19.650 --> 00:25:20.110
Right?

00:25:20.110 --> 00:25:21.960
I'm gonna get an answer
right back, saying, yep.

00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:22.620
The money's there.

00:25:22.620 --> 00:25:22.820
OK.

00:25:22.820 --> 00:25:23.840
I just authorized it.

00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:26.250
But it's a very simple, like,
ping right back and forth.

00:25:26.250 --> 00:25:26.768
Right?

00:25:26.768 --> 00:25:28.560
So it needs to be a
very small transaction.

00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:30.185
From there on you
can start to say, OK.

00:25:30.185 --> 00:25:32.610
Now let's batch transactions
and do the clearing.

00:25:32.610 --> 00:25:34.440
And then from there on you
actually send on the money.

00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:34.950
Right?

00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:37.620
The interesting part
about all of this

00:25:37.620 --> 00:25:39.750
is that it evolved in time.

00:25:39.750 --> 00:25:42.020
So this technology, if
you were to do it now

00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:44.340
with all of the tools that
are at our disposal now,

00:25:44.340 --> 00:25:46.050
you'd do it
differently, entirely.

00:25:46.050 --> 00:25:50.250
However, payments, as
Gary will point out

00:25:50.250 --> 00:25:52.980
in the next couple of slides,
basically evolved organically

00:25:52.980 --> 00:25:53.925
through decades.

00:25:53.925 --> 00:25:55.800
And you know, they
started with [INAUDIBLE]..

00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:57.050
GARY GENSLER: So stay with us.

00:25:57.050 --> 00:25:58.920
Stay with us just so that--

00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:01.830
That is literally a check
that Thomas Jefferson

00:26:01.830 --> 00:26:05.570
wrote to himself in 1809.

00:26:05.570 --> 00:26:07.670
But that is a
payment instruction

00:26:07.670 --> 00:26:09.470
from one Thomas
Jefferson account

00:26:09.470 --> 00:26:12.110
to another Thomas
Jefferson account.

00:26:12.110 --> 00:26:15.030
But it's a payment instruction.

00:26:15.030 --> 00:26:17.860
It didn't actually
move the money.

00:26:17.860 --> 00:26:19.680
It's just a payment instruction.

00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:21.170
This is a Western
Union Telegram.

00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:28.030
The telegraph came along in
the 1840's, if I remember.

00:26:28.030 --> 00:26:31.600
But Western Union took several
decades to come along and say,

00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:38.080
we can send instructions to
move value using the telegraph.

00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:42.160
And the Telex machine, which
was post-world War II-- and yes,

00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:44.380
I'm old enough to say
that there were still

00:26:44.380 --> 00:26:46.660
telex machines at
Goldman Sachs when

00:26:46.660 --> 00:26:50.620
I started in 1979
that you would type

00:26:50.620 --> 00:26:53.110
in to type in an instruction.

00:26:53.110 --> 00:26:55.570
So Alin, you're asking
where did it come from.

00:26:55.570 --> 00:27:01.130
It came from technology
move from first authorizing.

00:27:01.130 --> 00:27:04.540
Does that party have
the legal rights

00:27:04.540 --> 00:27:07.060
to move something, move value?

00:27:07.060 --> 00:27:09.280
Do they have enough
of the value?

00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:12.140
Is there enough
in their account?

00:27:12.140 --> 00:27:12.840
And so forth.

00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:15.140
That's the authorization phase.

00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:17.690
Now you'd say, well, can't that
all be done simultaneously?

00:27:17.690 --> 00:27:18.648
And the answer is, yes.

00:27:18.648 --> 00:27:19.820
Maybe.

00:27:19.820 --> 00:27:22.130
But most of the
payments system is still

00:27:22.130 --> 00:27:28.460
based on authorization,
clearing, and then settlement.

00:27:28.460 --> 00:27:30.530
Financial ledgers that
are also the reason.

00:27:30.530 --> 00:27:33.080
Ledgers record
economic activity.

00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:37.010
We've talked about this
earlier in the semester.

00:27:37.010 --> 00:27:39.770
They record transactions
or accounts.

00:27:39.770 --> 00:27:42.970
Bitcoin is a transaction ledger.

00:27:42.970 --> 00:27:47.220
Ethereum and others
are account ledgers.

00:27:47.220 --> 00:27:48.530
But they're both ledgers.

00:27:48.530 --> 00:27:53.690
They're both forms of recording
something that has a right.

00:27:53.690 --> 00:27:59.660
The data is usually used
around some right or a token.

00:27:59.660 --> 00:28:03.110
But the first ledgers were
thousands of years ago.

00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:05.210
And I think on those
ledgers, I don't

00:28:05.210 --> 00:28:07.400
know how they split
authorization, clearing,

00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:08.630
and settling.

00:28:08.630 --> 00:28:10.185
But they were a
form of a ledger.

00:28:13.350 --> 00:28:15.850
I like presidents, I
like American history.

00:28:15.850 --> 00:28:17.370
So I pulled--

00:28:17.370 --> 00:28:22.200
George Washington used to use
a personal ledger, single entry

00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:24.050
ledger.

00:28:24.050 --> 00:28:30.190
But the IBM 360 came
along in the early 1960s.

00:28:30.190 --> 00:28:34.280
And it revolutionized the
world of finance and ledgers.

00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:37.910
It still took about 14 years.

00:28:37.910 --> 00:28:40.470
I think it was in
the early 1970s

00:28:40.470 --> 00:28:43.710
after big paperwork crash
on Wall Street, meaning

00:28:43.710 --> 00:28:45.650
literal, physical
pieces of paper

00:28:45.650 --> 00:28:48.000
were moving around
the late 1960s.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.370
And they had to shut the New
York Stock Exchange down,

00:28:50.370 --> 00:28:52.800
I think, for a day or
two, because they'd

00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:57.310
gotten weeks or months
behind in clearing the paper.

00:28:57.310 --> 00:28:58.560
They had passed authorization.

00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:01.320
It was all in clearing
securities trends,

00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:04.440
and was created by
an act of Congress

00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:07.320
that there would be central
clearing and settling.

00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:13.100
And DTCC was in essence
created to solve and get out

00:29:13.100 --> 00:29:14.890
of that huge mess and a problem.

00:29:14.890 --> 00:29:16.760
But it was on the
backs of technology

00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:18.830
that it could even
be done, that there

00:29:18.830 --> 00:29:20.020
would be a central ledger.

00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:22.253
Is it helping to answer
your question yet?

00:29:22.253 --> 00:29:24.410
AUDIENCE: I think my
question kind of changed.

00:29:24.410 --> 00:29:26.330
So I'll talk to you
after the class.

00:29:26.330 --> 00:29:27.120
GARY GENSLER: OK.

00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:27.620
You're good.

00:29:27.620 --> 00:29:29.210
Do you have a question?

00:29:29.210 --> 00:29:30.650
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:29:30.650 --> 00:29:33.530
So one thing that came out
of the readings for me,

00:29:33.530 --> 00:29:35.550
I guess it's kind
of solved by checks.

00:29:35.550 --> 00:29:39.440
But like, how are cash transfers
captured in all of this?

00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:41.150
GARY GENSLER: How are cash--

00:29:41.150 --> 00:29:41.900
cash, cash.

00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:42.780
AUDIENCE: Cash cash.

00:29:42.780 --> 00:29:42.980
Right.

00:29:42.980 --> 00:29:44.930
Because now they have
digital everything.

00:29:44.930 --> 00:29:48.670
Everything is really
easy to track.

00:29:48.670 --> 00:29:53.030
And you talked about
confidential transactions

00:29:53.030 --> 00:29:55.940
or private transactions,
if you give me $10,

00:29:55.940 --> 00:29:59.480
nobody else in the world knows
that you gave me $10 back.

00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:01.830
GARY GENSLER: Well, right
now this is being recorded.

00:30:01.830 --> 00:30:02.880
It's being seen.

00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:04.410
And so you'll give
it back to me.

00:30:04.410 --> 00:30:05.500
AUDIENCE: 100%.

00:30:05.500 --> 00:30:06.300
GARY GENSLER: No,
you can take it.

00:30:06.300 --> 00:30:07.000
You can take it.

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:07.875
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:07.875 --> 00:30:08.690
GARY GENSLER: Now!

00:30:08.690 --> 00:30:09.320
Yeah, yeah.

00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:10.400
Remember.

00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:11.880
What lawsuit was that?

00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:15.168
The Scottish lawsuit?

00:30:15.168 --> 00:30:16.210
AUDIENCE: Can't remember.

00:30:16.210 --> 00:30:17.168
GARY GENSLER: Crawford.

00:30:19.060 --> 00:30:24.078
But that bill, what's
it say on the top?

00:30:24.078 --> 00:30:25.370
AUDIENCE: Federal Reserve note.

00:30:25.370 --> 00:30:27.750
GARY GENSLER: So it's
a Federal Reserve note.

00:30:27.750 --> 00:30:29.270
It is a Federal
Reserve note, which

00:30:29.270 --> 00:30:32.660
literally means it is a
liability of the central bank

00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:33.610
the US government.

00:30:33.610 --> 00:30:35.310
Now that's a social construct.

00:30:35.310 --> 00:30:39.620
We talked about it's not that
there is a room full of gold

00:30:39.620 --> 00:30:41.990
or a room full of
wheat behind it.

00:30:41.990 --> 00:30:45.120
There's some gold in Fort Knox.

00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:50.220
But that is a form of
a ledger transaction.

00:30:50.220 --> 00:30:52.020
If you read a little
bit more closely,

00:30:52.020 --> 00:30:54.437
can you see on the upper right
there's something in there?

00:30:57.810 --> 00:30:59.550
AUDIENCE: United
States of America.

00:30:59.550 --> 00:31:00.550
GARY GENSLER: All right.

00:31:00.550 --> 00:31:02.350
Is there a serial number?

00:31:02.350 --> 00:31:09.990
There is a unique serial number
on every Federal Reserve note.

00:31:09.990 --> 00:31:12.540
That unique serial
number is, in essence,

00:31:12.540 --> 00:31:15.990
tying it to a ledger, a
liability of the Federal

00:31:15.990 --> 00:31:17.660
Reserve.

00:31:17.660 --> 00:31:21.560
But it's a tokenized
ledger receipt.

00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:22.610
I've handed it to you.

00:31:22.610 --> 00:31:24.680
It's anonymous-- well,
it's not anonymous,

00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:26.570
because it was
captured on the film.

00:31:26.570 --> 00:31:30.830
But it was anonymous because
it's a tokenized paper.

00:31:30.830 --> 00:31:32.915
It's actually linen,
it's not really paper.

00:31:36.260 --> 00:31:39.440
Anybody know who
is the sole source

00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:42.290
manufacturer of the linen
that goes into Federal Reserve

00:31:42.290 --> 00:31:43.780
notes?

00:31:43.780 --> 00:31:44.886
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:31:44.886 --> 00:31:45.280
GARY GENSLER: No.

00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:45.900
Crane.

00:31:45.900 --> 00:31:52.340
C-R-A-N-E is the name of the
company that has the contract.

00:31:52.340 --> 00:31:53.900
But to answer your
question, it's

00:31:53.900 --> 00:31:58.430
a tokenized form of a
specific serialized ledger

00:31:58.430 --> 00:31:59.720
on the Federal Reserve.

00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:03.530
AUDIENCE: So that
only gets triggered

00:32:03.530 --> 00:32:07.010
if it goes into and
out of institutions.

00:32:07.010 --> 00:32:07.550
Right?

00:32:07.550 --> 00:32:10.270
If this bill comes to me, and
then goes to somebody else

00:32:10.270 --> 00:32:10.860
and goes to somebody else--

00:32:10.860 --> 00:32:11.600
GARY GENSLER: Like, James.

00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:11.810
Yeah.

00:32:11.810 --> 00:32:13.110
AUDIENCE: --before
it goes on to a bank.

00:32:13.110 --> 00:32:14.020
GARY GENSLER: Yeah.

00:32:14.020 --> 00:32:16.430
AUDIENCE: Then none of those
transactions are tracked.

00:32:16.430 --> 00:32:17.320
GARY GENSLER: That's correct.

00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:19.150
AUDIENCE: But on something
like Venmo, they are.

00:32:19.150 --> 00:32:20.510
So something like
Bitcoin, they are too.

00:32:20.510 --> 00:32:21.760
GARY GENSLER: So we're moving.

00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:24.170
There's a big trend that's
happening over these last 50

00:32:24.170 --> 00:32:26.210
years.

00:32:26.210 --> 00:32:30.680
And if you go back 200
years, it was all anonymous.

00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:32.540
But once you get into
the 20th century,

00:32:32.540 --> 00:32:35.480
it starts to be more
or more digitized,

00:32:35.480 --> 00:32:38.840
even early 20th century,
commerce-- big commerce--

00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:41.570
was starting to be in
the banking system.

00:32:41.570 --> 00:32:45.860
But in the last 50 years, and
certainly the last 20 years,

00:32:45.860 --> 00:32:50.630
we're almost fully digitized
in developed countries, not

00:32:50.630 --> 00:32:52.210
middle economic countries.

00:32:52.210 --> 00:32:54.180
But that's correct.

00:32:54.180 --> 00:32:56.330
But this still ties
back to a ledger.

00:32:56.330 --> 00:32:58.220
I'll get that back later.

00:32:58.220 --> 00:33:00.110
Credit cards.

00:33:00.110 --> 00:33:03.110
The first big write-up
of credit cards

00:33:03.110 --> 00:33:06.500
was a book from the 1880s that
said, what would the world be

00:33:06.500 --> 00:33:08.600
like in the year 2000?

00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:13.280
And 15 or 20 times in the book
it used the word "credit card."

00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:18.530
They fictionalized the
future of credit cards.

00:33:18.530 --> 00:33:20.360
I haven't read the
book, but I just

00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:24.500
love that it was
written in the 1880s.

00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:27.980
But the actual start of
the use of credit tokens,

00:33:27.980 --> 00:33:31.130
if not credit cards,
started actually

00:33:31.130 --> 00:33:33.380
in the late 19th century.

00:33:33.380 --> 00:33:35.960
And the idea is that you
could have a token that

00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:37.640
was for as particular merchant.

00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:42.020
And by the 1920s you had them
for getting your gasoline

00:33:42.020 --> 00:33:44.660
when automobiles started to
be popular, and so forth.

00:33:44.660 --> 00:33:47.300
But they were not
generalized credit tokens.

00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:50.010
They were a credit token
really by one merchant.

00:33:50.010 --> 00:33:53.540
So think of them as a
merchant-specific token.

00:33:53.540 --> 00:33:58.040
In the 1940s in Brooklyn,
New York, somebody--

00:33:58.040 --> 00:34:02.900
in essence the innovation was
to have a more generalized token

00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:07.120
that could give you credit
at more than one merchant.

00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:10.810
And once that happened, of
course, credit cards took off.

00:34:10.810 --> 00:34:13.300
First in the US, Diner's Card.

00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:15.659
American Express
was in the mid '50s.

00:34:15.659 --> 00:34:17.949
And then Bank of
America figured out,

00:34:17.949 --> 00:34:23.560
maybe we will even extend
credit multiple banks.

00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:25.150
And they created a network.

00:34:25.150 --> 00:34:27.250
Bank of America was
a California bank.

00:34:27.250 --> 00:34:29.139
It's not the bank
you think of now.

00:34:29.139 --> 00:34:32.469
In those days it was
California based.

00:34:32.469 --> 00:34:35.110
But maybe we can have a
network across the whole US.

00:34:35.110 --> 00:34:39.070
And that network is actually
the network that became Visa.

00:34:39.070 --> 00:34:42.250
It was a shared
ownership service

00:34:42.250 --> 00:34:46.659
amongst a bunch of banks across.

00:34:46.659 --> 00:34:50.170
But the cards had
to be processed.

00:34:50.170 --> 00:34:52.960
Does anybody even ever
see the processing

00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:54.610
that's in the left,
in the middle,

00:34:54.610 --> 00:34:57.170
any longer in the US and Europe?

00:34:57.170 --> 00:34:59.005
No, you probably--

00:34:59.005 --> 00:35:00.950
ALIN DRAGOS: The
imprinters still exist.

00:35:00.950 --> 00:35:03.310
There are some cab
drivers who will still

00:35:03.310 --> 00:35:05.710
take out, like, one of those--

00:35:05.710 --> 00:35:06.647
one of those machines.

00:35:06.647 --> 00:35:07.480
So they still exist.

00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:08.897
GARY GENSLER: So
they still exist.

00:35:08.897 --> 00:35:11.180
So technology has
moved us in advance.

00:35:11.180 --> 00:35:13.810
So here we're going to do
modern payment systems.

00:35:13.810 --> 00:35:16.390
I think Alin's going
to help me out here.

00:35:16.390 --> 00:35:18.550
You've got a customer.

00:35:18.550 --> 00:35:19.720
You'll see this play out.

00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:23.020
But this is complex system.

00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:25.300
The customer has
an issuing bank.

00:35:25.300 --> 00:35:26.650
I'm going to say it's me.

00:35:26.650 --> 00:35:30.640
And I'm Gary Gensler,
and it's Bank of America.

00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:33.970
And I might use a credit
card to instruct my bank,

00:35:33.970 --> 00:35:36.430
I might use a check, I
might use a debit card.

00:35:36.430 --> 00:35:38.810
I actually have all three--

00:35:38.810 --> 00:35:42.860
credit card, debit
card, and checks.

00:35:42.860 --> 00:35:45.530
I could instruct them in
any of those three ways,

00:35:45.530 --> 00:35:47.360
but there's other ways
I can instruct them.

00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:50.540
I can instruct them and ask
Bank of America to send a wire.

00:35:50.540 --> 00:35:54.470
I can in the US ask them to
send an automated clearing house

00:35:54.470 --> 00:35:55.060
payment--

00:35:55.060 --> 00:35:56.510
ACH.

00:35:56.510 --> 00:35:58.220
Wires are more real time.

00:35:58.220 --> 00:36:00.650
ACH take up to two days--

00:36:00.650 --> 00:36:02.053
is it now?

00:36:02.053 --> 00:36:03.720
ALIN DRAGOS: That's
in the longest form.

00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:05.000
GARY GENSLER: OK.

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:07.640
ALIN DRAGOS: The ACH has been
suffering some pressures,

00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:09.040
and now they actually offer--

00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:09.440
GARY GENSLER: Real time.

00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:10.850
ALIN DRAGOS: --almost
real time [INAUDIBLE]..

00:36:10.850 --> 00:36:12.433
GARY GENSLER: But
traditionally, wires

00:36:12.433 --> 00:36:15.220
were something that you did
which were more immediate,

00:36:15.220 --> 00:36:19.440
and what's called
ACH, more slowly.

00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:21.230
So there's actually
five ways I could

00:36:21.230 --> 00:36:25.430
have my Bank of America
send something of value.

00:36:25.430 --> 00:36:27.560
It has to go through
some network.

00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:31.970
It's too small to see, but the
first little blue arrow there

00:36:31.970 --> 00:36:33.450
is Visa MasterCard.

00:36:33.450 --> 00:36:36.560
It might be going across
a credit card network.

00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:41.410
The second arrow there is
where this guy used to work,

00:36:41.410 --> 00:36:42.970
First Data stripe.

00:36:42.970 --> 00:36:48.250
There's dozens and dozens of
payment processors or payment

00:36:48.250 --> 00:36:49.630
system processors--

00:36:49.630 --> 00:36:51.400
PSPs.

00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:53.560
So you have a credit
card, but you might also

00:36:53.560 --> 00:36:56.890
have somebody call it a PSP.

00:36:56.890 --> 00:36:59.170
Has anybody started a
business in this room?

00:36:59.170 --> 00:37:00.460
A merchant?

00:37:00.460 --> 00:37:02.470
I'm sure somebody-- has anybody?

00:37:02.470 --> 00:37:03.310
All right.

00:37:03.310 --> 00:37:05.890
Did you have to hire a
payment system processor?

00:37:05.890 --> 00:37:06.665
Who'd you hire?

00:37:06.665 --> 00:37:07.540
AUDIENCE: First Data.

00:37:07.540 --> 00:37:08.858
GARY GENSLER: First Data.

00:37:08.858 --> 00:37:10.900
When I was chief financial
officer of the Hillary

00:37:10.900 --> 00:37:14.100
campaign, we had to hire a
payment system processor.

00:37:14.100 --> 00:37:16.230
It was Stripe.

00:37:16.230 --> 00:37:19.350
So all the donations
that were coming in,

00:37:19.350 --> 00:37:21.090
somebody could use
a MasterCard, could

00:37:21.090 --> 00:37:23.280
use a Visa, could use
an American Express.

00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:26.940
We didn't have any
legal contract.

00:37:26.940 --> 00:37:27.780
We were a merchant--

00:37:27.780 --> 00:37:30.030
I mean, you might think of
it as a political campaign,

00:37:30.030 --> 00:37:30.988
but we were a merchant.

00:37:30.988 --> 00:37:33.490
You were a merchant,
you hired first data.

00:37:33.490 --> 00:37:35.320
So when you start
your businesses,

00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:39.210
whether it's a grocery store,
a bar, a political campaign,

00:37:39.210 --> 00:37:41.130
or something else,
you're a merchant.

00:37:41.130 --> 00:37:44.640
You don't want to deal with a
bunch of credit card companies.

00:37:44.640 --> 00:37:47.840
You want one payment
system processor.

00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:49.350
And you chose First Data.

00:37:49.350 --> 00:37:55.540
We chose Stripe in
that circumstance.

00:37:55.540 --> 00:37:58.710
So those are the networks.

00:37:58.710 --> 00:38:01.590
Then on the other side
there's the merchant bank.

00:38:01.590 --> 00:38:04.950
For the Hillary campaign
it was Amalgamated Bank.

00:38:04.950 --> 00:38:05.830
Who is your bank?

00:38:05.830 --> 00:38:07.350
Do you care [INAUDIBLE]?

00:38:07.350 --> 00:38:08.510
AUDIENCE: It was in Korea.

00:38:08.510 --> 00:38:09.090
GARY GENSLER: It was in Korea?

00:38:09.090 --> 00:38:09.715
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:38:09.715 --> 00:38:12.570
GARY GENSLER: Korea
Bank One, let's call it.

00:38:12.570 --> 00:38:13.600
Korea Bank One.

00:38:16.410 --> 00:38:19.410
But the customer is all of a
sudden, it's at five layers

00:38:19.410 --> 00:38:22.770
before it gets to your bank.

00:38:22.770 --> 00:38:24.750
And then, of course,
you have access

00:38:24.750 --> 00:38:26.830
and so forth, and
you're the customer.

00:38:26.830 --> 00:38:29.250
So all of these steps
are in this chain.

00:38:29.250 --> 00:38:34.050
This is modern payment
systems, pretty detailed.

00:38:34.050 --> 00:38:35.383
Digital wallets we talked about.

00:38:35.383 --> 00:38:37.842
We're going to say a little
bit more about digital wallets.

00:38:37.842 --> 00:38:39.960
And the big question is
whether cryptocurrency

00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:41.490
is going to have something.

00:38:41.490 --> 00:38:44.010
But before you get
to digital wallets,

00:38:44.010 --> 00:38:45.810
this is the payment stream.

00:38:45.810 --> 00:38:47.520
And part of the
answer, Alin, too

00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:51.180
is why you need authorization,
clearing, and settlement

00:38:51.180 --> 00:38:53.250
is there's a lot
of steps in this,

00:38:53.250 --> 00:38:56.720
in the traditional
movement of money.

00:38:56.720 --> 00:38:59.410
And this is just domestic.

00:38:59.410 --> 00:39:03.510
You can add digital wallets,
and you could add Bitcoin.

00:39:03.510 --> 00:39:05.210
And the question is,
does cryptocurrency

00:39:05.210 --> 00:39:07.520
skip all this stuff
in the middle?

00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:11.990
And can digital wallets jump
start over some of these?

00:39:11.990 --> 00:39:13.670
And the answer is,
digital wallets

00:39:13.670 --> 00:39:16.460
need to do all these things
if they're going to jump.

00:39:16.460 --> 00:39:18.140
They have to store
the value; they

00:39:18.140 --> 00:39:22.480
have to do some authorization;
the equivalent of clearing,

00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:24.760
if there's any
clearing; and then move

00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:28.140
it, which is settlement.

00:39:28.140 --> 00:39:29.838
So these are the fees.

00:39:29.838 --> 00:39:30.380
You want to--

00:39:30.380 --> 00:39:32.040
ALIN DRAGOS: Can I
add a few things?

00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:32.700
GARY GENSLER: Yeah, please.

00:39:32.700 --> 00:39:33.360
ALIN DRAGOS: A few minutes.

00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:34.940
GARY GENSLER: No, take more.

00:39:34.940 --> 00:39:35.520
ALIN DRAGOS: I wanted to
say a couple of things.

00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:36.090
Right?

00:39:36.090 --> 00:39:40.320
First of all, you'll have
to appreciate the fact

00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:43.750
that this is a system
created by banks for banks.

00:39:43.750 --> 00:39:44.250
Right?

00:39:44.250 --> 00:39:45.540
And I think that--

00:39:45.540 --> 00:39:47.100
it shows, right?

00:39:47.100 --> 00:39:48.960
This entire value
chain, which we're

00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:50.910
going to go through
right afterwards,

00:39:50.910 --> 00:39:55.260
basically relies on
consumer using this process

00:39:55.260 --> 00:39:57.030
to pay a recipient.

00:39:57.030 --> 00:39:59.010
It can be a merchant
or another person.

00:39:59.010 --> 00:40:00.180
Right?

00:40:00.180 --> 00:40:03.420
Merchants like the fact
that they get value.

00:40:03.420 --> 00:40:05.860
They don't have the type that
have to pay a lot of money.

00:40:05.860 --> 00:40:08.250
So there's an inner
intention there.

00:40:08.250 --> 00:40:10.998
And that intention manifests
itself in a number of ways.

00:40:10.998 --> 00:40:11.790
But it's important.

00:40:11.790 --> 00:40:12.290
Right.

00:40:12.290 --> 00:40:14.370
So just the dynamics
are [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:14.370 --> 00:40:19.017
to where this black box out
here getting money over here

00:40:19.017 --> 00:40:20.850
automatically have kind
of a [INAUDIBLE] way

00:40:20.850 --> 00:40:22.750
to the banks for the merchants.

00:40:22.750 --> 00:40:24.050
Right?

00:40:24.050 --> 00:40:26.580
The interesting piece here
is that this access method

00:40:26.580 --> 00:40:30.390
is probably the most underrated
aspect of this entire bank

00:40:30.390 --> 00:40:31.020
chain.

00:40:31.020 --> 00:40:33.180
If you think of anytime
you go up to a merchant

00:40:33.180 --> 00:40:36.570
or to a website or
whatever, whoever

00:40:36.570 --> 00:40:38.112
manages that access
point is probably

00:40:38.112 --> 00:40:39.153
the most important thing.

00:40:39.153 --> 00:40:41.160
You may have the best
solution out there.

00:40:41.160 --> 00:40:43.306
If you're not in
that access method,

00:40:43.306 --> 00:40:44.810
might as well not have it.

00:40:44.810 --> 00:40:46.560
And that, I think, is
something to import.

00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:49.770
Cause as you're going to
go through [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:49.770 --> 00:40:52.470
where does value accumulate in
this value chain, what you're

00:40:52.470 --> 00:40:55.053
going to see is more often than
not [INAUDIBLE] methods aren't

00:40:55.053 --> 00:40:57.807
going to [INAUDIBLE] point to
actually any meaningful change.

00:40:57.807 --> 00:40:59.390
Because those are
hard changes, right?

00:40:59.390 --> 00:41:02.860
For a large merchant, changing
anything at access point,

00:41:02.860 --> 00:41:03.480
it's hard.

00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:04.980
So that's something
to keep in mind.

00:41:04.980 --> 00:41:05.550
Right?

00:41:05.550 --> 00:41:07.680
The other thing I
would say is one

00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:09.870
of the things where
we talked about how

00:41:09.870 --> 00:41:11.970
exactly to get big
change at scale,

00:41:11.970 --> 00:41:13.830
and you have to have two things.

00:41:13.830 --> 00:41:17.015
You have to have technology,
which is this is OK.

00:41:17.015 --> 00:41:17.640
It's not great.

00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:17.930
Right?

00:41:17.930 --> 00:41:18.640
This is kind of old.

00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:21.057
It used to be really great
about two or three decades ago,

00:41:21.057 --> 00:41:22.770
but this is not [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:22.770 --> 00:41:25.920
But this is an unbelievable
business model.

00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:28.430
And if you look at the way
the business model operates,

00:41:28.430 --> 00:41:29.430
consumer love it.

00:41:29.430 --> 00:41:30.210
Consumers love it.

00:41:30.210 --> 00:41:31.090
So consumer gets--

00:41:31.090 --> 00:41:31.920
I can pay wherever.

00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:32.420
It's great.

00:41:32.420 --> 00:41:33.700
Right?

00:41:33.700 --> 00:41:34.640
Banks love it.

00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:36.515
You know, they make a
lot of money out of it.

00:41:36.515 --> 00:41:38.550
They get what's
called [INAUDIBLE]..

00:41:38.550 --> 00:41:41.810
All these other vendors out
here exist because of it.

00:41:41.810 --> 00:41:45.840
Merchants, I would say
are kind of neutral to it.

00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:49.350
They dislike many aspects of
it, but then processing cash

00:41:49.350 --> 00:41:50.410
is also expensive.

00:41:50.410 --> 00:41:51.000
Right?

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:53.062
So if you're trying
to understand where do

00:41:53.062 --> 00:41:54.270
I want to change things here?

00:41:54.270 --> 00:41:56.370
A lot of the folks in
the actual payment space

00:41:56.370 --> 00:41:58.370
will tell you, well,
payments is kind of-- you

00:41:58.370 --> 00:41:59.370
know-- it kind of works.

00:41:59.370 --> 00:41:59.870
Right?

00:41:59.870 --> 00:42:02.160
It really doesn't work
if you're on the fringes.

00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:04.540
But if you're in the
middle, it kind of works.

00:42:04.540 --> 00:42:06.120
It's a pretty good system.

00:42:06.120 --> 00:42:08.915
And the beauty of the existing
model we have right now

00:42:08.915 --> 00:42:11.040
is actually the business
model on the way it works.

00:42:11.040 --> 00:42:12.995
So I'll pause right
there [INAUDIBLE]..

00:42:12.995 --> 00:42:14.370
GARY GENSLER: But
it's expensive.

00:42:14.370 --> 00:42:15.330
ALIN DRAGOS: It's
expensive [INAUDIBLE]..

00:42:15.330 --> 00:42:17.038
GARY GENSLER: It's
got a lot of friction.

00:42:19.650 --> 00:42:21.870
World Bank statistics
say payment systems

00:42:21.870 --> 00:42:27.290
around the globe take a half
a percent to 1% of economies.

00:42:27.290 --> 00:42:28.748
Now economies would
be much smaller

00:42:28.748 --> 00:42:31.082
if we didn't have payment
systems, because we would have

00:42:31.082 --> 00:42:32.950
never probably come
out of the dark ages

00:42:32.950 --> 00:42:35.800
without some form
of payment systems.

00:42:35.800 --> 00:42:38.230
And in the last 50
years I think it's

00:42:38.230 --> 00:42:42.650
been part of how economic
growth has continued

00:42:42.650 --> 00:42:44.550
in the internet phase.

00:42:44.550 --> 00:42:49.480
You know, how we all
transact on the internet.

00:42:49.480 --> 00:42:52.920
But if you take nothing
other than, it's complicated

00:42:52.920 --> 00:42:55.990
and there's a lot of
points of friction,

00:42:55.990 --> 00:42:57.240
then I've done my job.

00:42:57.240 --> 00:43:00.240
You don't need to know all the
individual pieces unless you

00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:02.430
actually personally
want to compete

00:43:02.430 --> 00:43:11.200
with PayPal or Venmo or
Zelle or Alipay, which

00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:13.247
is what you might do one day.

00:43:13.247 --> 00:43:14.330
ALIN DRAGOS: I don't know.

00:43:14.330 --> 00:43:16.715
GARY GENSLER: Yeah,
just a rumor has it.

00:43:16.715 --> 00:43:19.657
ALIN DRAGOS: Well, the funny
thing is, as you'll see,

00:43:19.657 --> 00:43:21.740
every now and then there
comes a player that says,

00:43:21.740 --> 00:43:23.270
we're going to disrupt payments.

00:43:23.270 --> 00:43:26.990
And it is one of the
hardest products to disrupt.

00:43:26.990 --> 00:43:29.930
GARY GENSLER: It's a hard place
to disrupt, largely, I think,

00:43:29.930 --> 00:43:32.690
because of the
collective action issues.

00:43:32.690 --> 00:43:34.910
There's millions
of merchants that

00:43:34.910 --> 00:43:38.510
rely on dozens of payment
system providers that, yes,

00:43:38.510 --> 00:43:43.160
only rely on three to six credit
card or debit card companies.

00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:46.030
In any country there's
usually two to three dominant.

00:43:46.030 --> 00:43:49.100
It's not always Visa and
MasterCard, of course,

00:43:49.100 --> 00:43:50.930
not in China, for instance.

00:43:50.930 --> 00:43:56.920
But the merchant end has such
a huge collective action.

00:43:56.920 --> 00:43:59.845
And that's why Alin focused
on the access points.

00:43:59.845 --> 00:44:01.470
If you're going to
disrupt this, you've

00:44:01.470 --> 00:44:05.880
got to figure out some way to
get adoption-- broad adoption--

00:44:05.880 --> 00:44:08.220
on the merchant class.

00:44:08.220 --> 00:44:09.570
The money.

00:44:09.570 --> 00:44:14.640
This was from the Bloomberg
article, the Bloomberg article

00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:17.510
that was reviewing China.

00:44:17.510 --> 00:44:23.150
$2.75 in the US on average comes
out of every $100 purchase.

00:44:23.150 --> 00:44:27.980
And by the way, if you make
$1,000 purchase, it's $27.

00:44:27.980 --> 00:44:31.550
And I used to think when I
was on the CFO of the Hillary

00:44:31.550 --> 00:44:33.470
campaign, if somebody
was generous enough

00:44:33.470 --> 00:44:36.740
to give us $2,700, which
was the legal limit

00:44:36.740 --> 00:44:41.570
to a political candidate
during that cycle,

00:44:41.570 --> 00:44:48.320
we were paying 70
US dollars to this,

00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:53.280
to that, to help
elect a president.

00:44:53.280 --> 00:45:01.200
Or in a billion dollar
campaign, 2.7% is $27 million.

00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:03.240
Now I'm not saying
we spent $27 million

00:45:03.240 --> 00:45:05.580
on this, because we
were able to encourage

00:45:05.580 --> 00:45:09.690
some donors to give us checks.

00:45:09.690 --> 00:45:12.900
But I will tell you,
even being recorded,

00:45:12.900 --> 00:45:16.410
in the modern economy it's
hard to convince somebody

00:45:16.410 --> 00:45:18.810
to give you a check, even
somebody who is generously

00:45:18.810 --> 00:45:20.910
giving their support to
a political candidate

00:45:20.910 --> 00:45:22.500
to win the presidency.

00:45:22.500 --> 00:45:26.520
And you say, well, we
actually get $70 more

00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:28.730
if you give us a check.

00:45:28.730 --> 00:45:31.800
Yeah, but I got my
credit card here.

00:45:31.800 --> 00:45:32.970
So, yes.

00:45:32.970 --> 00:45:35.860
AUDIENCE: How would that
work if say, you gave 27.70?

00:45:35.860 --> 00:45:38.700
And so the political
campaign actually

00:45:38.700 --> 00:45:41.745
ended up with $2,700
in the bucket.

00:45:41.745 --> 00:45:45.030
GARY GENSLER: So this is a
legal question for the Federal

00:45:45.030 --> 00:45:47.340
Election Commission lawyers.

00:45:47.340 --> 00:45:49.170
But we asked that question.

00:45:49.170 --> 00:45:50.790
We did ask that question.

00:45:50.790 --> 00:45:52.500
And it's not allowed.

00:45:52.500 --> 00:45:56.100
It's not allowed, because it's
going beyond the legal limit

00:45:56.100 --> 00:45:58.710
under our federal laws for
campaign contributions.

00:45:58.710 --> 00:46:05.200
That would be deemed to be
a 2,770 dollar contribution.

00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:09.390
Even if somehow the donor
is paying the $70 directly,

00:46:09.390 --> 00:46:10.680
we weren't able to solve--

00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:14.430
by the way, we were not able to
solve that, because the payment

00:46:14.430 --> 00:46:19.860
system provider, in our
case, Stripe or First Data,

00:46:19.860 --> 00:46:23.970
is actually a vendor
for the merchant.

00:46:23.970 --> 00:46:27.240
And the political campaign
in essence is the merchant.

00:46:27.240 --> 00:46:27.740
You with me?

00:46:27.740 --> 00:46:28.525
Shawn.

00:46:28.525 --> 00:46:30.900
AUDIENCE: Well, when you make
a, for instance, $1 million

00:46:30.900 --> 00:46:32.350
donation, it's not that--

00:46:32.350 --> 00:46:33.600
GARY GENSLER: A what donation?

00:46:33.600 --> 00:46:34.740
AUDIENCE: If you
make a $1 million--

00:46:34.740 --> 00:46:35.730
GARY GENSLER: A
million dollars, that's

00:46:35.730 --> 00:46:36.938
breaking the law right there.

00:46:36.938 --> 00:46:38.970
But OK.

00:46:38.970 --> 00:46:39.903
I'm big filmed.

00:46:39.903 --> 00:46:40.570
I just want to--

00:46:40.570 --> 00:46:41.430
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:46:41.430 --> 00:46:43.380
You're not actually
making a million,

00:46:43.380 --> 00:46:47.760
because you get perhaps
1.5% or 2% of the points

00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:48.962
back on your credit.

00:46:48.962 --> 00:46:49.670
GARY GENSLER: Oh.

00:46:49.670 --> 00:46:50.940
Yeah, right.

00:46:50.940 --> 00:46:54.000
So Sean is just observing
that well, actually the donor

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:56.140
is getting some points back.

00:46:56.140 --> 00:46:59.660
So this is just averages, and
averages sometimes mask things.

00:46:59.660 --> 00:47:06.430
But $2.20 of the $2.75 actually
goes back to the quote--

00:47:06.430 --> 00:47:08.870
"issuing bank."

00:47:08.870 --> 00:47:11.820
So if you're doing something
on Bank of America,

00:47:11.820 --> 00:47:14.390
Bank of America might
then give you points

00:47:14.390 --> 00:47:16.010
and share generously.

00:47:16.010 --> 00:47:18.560
And a lot of the bank
programs will share maybe up

00:47:18.560 --> 00:47:20.060
to half of that.

00:47:20.060 --> 00:47:25.520
You might get $1 per every $100
or one point for every 100.

00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:26.840
But they're getting $2.20.

00:47:26.840 --> 00:47:29.295
But you're right.

00:47:29.295 --> 00:47:30.920
There were some donors
that said, well,

00:47:30.920 --> 00:47:32.780
I'm using my American
Express card.

00:47:32.780 --> 00:47:34.310
I'm getting my points back.

00:47:34.310 --> 00:47:36.080
And if they gave $1,000--

00:47:36.080 --> 00:47:38.510
not a million-- you know,
that they would maybe

00:47:38.510 --> 00:47:42.750
get the equivalent of
$10 of points back.

00:47:42.750 --> 00:47:44.480
That is correct.

00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:48.620
So merchants aren't
enthusiastic about this split.

00:47:48.620 --> 00:47:50.960
This is the US model.

00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:54.450
It does not cost
this much in India.

00:47:54.450 --> 00:47:57.700
It does not cost
this much in China.

00:47:57.700 --> 00:47:59.460
So in many other
countries the jump

00:47:59.460 --> 00:48:03.270
started around the credit
card payment systems.

00:48:03.270 --> 00:48:04.510
It costs a lot less.

00:48:04.510 --> 00:48:06.720
But in the US,
our payment system

00:48:06.720 --> 00:48:10.440
is significantly built
on credit card rails--

00:48:10.440 --> 00:48:15.750
rails like tracks-- it's called.

00:48:15.750 --> 00:48:16.455
So cross-border.

00:48:16.455 --> 00:48:18.330
I'm not going to go
through these two charts.

00:48:18.330 --> 00:48:20.257
These were-- Shimon were you--

00:48:20.257 --> 00:48:22.590
AUDIENCE: I think the US is
somewhat unique in the sense

00:48:22.590 --> 00:48:26.160
that there's bundling of
the payment as a service,

00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:27.380
and the credit.

00:48:27.380 --> 00:48:27.880
Right?

00:48:27.880 --> 00:48:28.360
GARY GENSLER: Right.

00:48:28.360 --> 00:48:30.193
AUDIENCE: And those are
being unbundled now.

00:48:30.193 --> 00:48:32.410
But doesn't have to be the case.

00:48:32.410 --> 00:48:33.630
And it's not always the case.

00:48:33.630 --> 00:48:34.040
Right.

00:48:34.040 --> 00:48:36.540
GARY GENSLER: So Shimon's point
is that we, in this country,

00:48:36.540 --> 00:48:39.450
have bundled the credit
provision with the payment

00:48:39.450 --> 00:48:40.770
provision.

00:48:40.770 --> 00:48:45.450
And there are many of us that
when the merchant says, give me

00:48:45.450 --> 00:48:47.700
your payment data, we
give him a credit card,

00:48:47.700 --> 00:48:54.810
even though we might, in fact,
regularly pay off our credit

00:48:54.810 --> 00:48:55.920
card on a monthly.

00:48:55.920 --> 00:48:57.780
I mean, many Americans don't.

00:48:57.780 --> 00:48:59.460
But many Americans do.

00:48:59.460 --> 00:49:02.880
So it's this bundling of
payment and credit services.

00:49:02.880 --> 00:49:05.580
And you're absolutely right,
because when the internet came

00:49:05.580 --> 00:49:10.560
along in our country, we had
established credit card payment

00:49:10.560 --> 00:49:11.970
rails.

00:49:11.970 --> 00:49:14.130
And most of the internet
payments, whether it

00:49:14.130 --> 00:49:16.830
was for your mortgage--

00:49:16.830 --> 00:49:18.690
well, usually not
mortgage, but whether it

00:49:18.690 --> 00:49:23.820
was for your utilities or
your small dollar payments

00:49:23.820 --> 00:49:26.250
were built on top of
the credit card rails.

00:49:26.250 --> 00:49:29.370
Your mortgage-- most mortgage
lenders would say, no.

00:49:29.370 --> 00:49:32.850
I don't want to pay the 2.7%.

00:49:36.490 --> 00:49:38.290
We didn't have
enough market power

00:49:38.290 --> 00:49:40.060
even as a political
campaign to get

00:49:40.060 --> 00:49:42.790
people to give it
to us in checks,

00:49:42.790 --> 00:49:46.780
or to Zelle payment to us.

00:49:46.780 --> 00:49:49.540
But this 2.7 is economic rents.

00:49:49.540 --> 00:49:52.540
This is a form of
economic rents.

00:49:52.540 --> 00:49:53.050
Fraud.

00:49:53.050 --> 00:49:56.905
Does anybody know the figures
for frauds in this country?

00:49:56.905 --> 00:49:58.780
I went and looked at it
in the last two days.

00:49:58.780 --> 00:50:01.180
So it was not in the readings.

00:50:01.180 --> 00:50:05.060
Total fraud is about
10 to 20 basis points.

00:50:05.060 --> 00:50:10.150
So of this 270 basis
points-- or 2.7%--

00:50:10.150 --> 00:50:13.460
less than 10% of it's really
going to pay for fraud.

00:50:13.460 --> 00:50:17.000
Now fraud is a really big
thing, don't get me wrong.

00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:20.980
But it's a small
portion of this.

00:50:20.980 --> 00:50:24.160
It's not the dominant
feature here.

00:50:24.160 --> 00:50:26.930
AUDIENCE: What is the credit
risk cost that's covered

00:50:26.930 --> 00:50:29.335
by that 2.20?

00:50:29.335 --> 00:50:32.726
So the bank is-- there's
typical losses on credit cards,

00:50:32.726 --> 00:50:34.510
[INAUDIBLE].

00:50:34.510 --> 00:50:36.010
AUDIENCE: So one
thing I would say--

00:50:36.010 --> 00:50:37.660
I think that point
that was just made

00:50:37.660 --> 00:50:39.380
was-- it was really just right.

00:50:39.380 --> 00:50:41.360
You do want to just
conceptually think

00:50:41.360 --> 00:50:43.600
about payments--
digital payments--

00:50:43.600 --> 00:50:45.040
and credit as different.

00:50:45.040 --> 00:50:47.690
They're just different products.

00:50:47.690 --> 00:50:51.160
So typically, extending
credit to someone,

00:50:51.160 --> 00:50:52.660
it's a very personal
relationship.

00:50:52.660 --> 00:50:53.420
Right?

00:50:53.420 --> 00:50:56.380
You cannot really-- you can look
at [INAUDIBLE] and basically

00:50:56.380 --> 00:50:56.950
make a guess.

00:50:56.950 --> 00:50:59.020
Right?

00:50:59.020 --> 00:51:01.438
[INAUDIBLE] there's
so-- some type

00:51:01.438 --> 00:51:02.980
of [INAUDIBLE] called
debit payments.

00:51:02.980 --> 00:51:03.480
Right?

00:51:03.480 --> 00:51:05.230
When you're using
money you already have.

00:51:05.230 --> 00:51:07.850
Well, that credit risk is much,
much smaller than the money

00:51:07.850 --> 00:51:10.210
that you're not going to
pay me back if [INAUDIBLE]..

00:51:10.210 --> 00:51:14.350
So I would say the big thing
that I would encourage everyone

00:51:14.350 --> 00:51:15.730
is to separate the two.

00:51:15.730 --> 00:51:18.550
And more to the point of
a what is the credit risk.

00:51:22.138 --> 00:51:23.680
I would say it's
probably [? half. ?]

00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:25.388
GARY GENSLER: So I
don't know the number,

00:51:25.388 --> 00:51:26.500
and I'll research it.

00:51:26.500 --> 00:51:31.960
But I would caution to say
the compensation for credit

00:51:31.960 --> 00:51:33.520
doesn't only come out of this.

00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:35.860
It also comes out
of the anywhere

00:51:35.860 --> 00:51:39.610
from 18% to 27% interest
rates they're charging.

00:51:39.610 --> 00:51:47.100
So when you think about it
like, it's a dual model.

00:51:47.100 --> 00:51:51.280
It's this, which is not
solely for the payment,

00:51:51.280 --> 00:51:55.330
but I'm saying this is largely
for using the credit card rails

00:51:55.330 --> 00:51:57.820
as a payment rail.

00:51:57.820 --> 00:52:00.400
And then you charge an
interest rate spread,

00:52:00.400 --> 00:52:04.390
which is over 1,000
basis points, usually.

00:52:04.390 --> 00:52:08.540
The spread versus
underlying bank borrowing

00:52:08.540 --> 00:52:12.360
tends to be anywhere from
1,000 to 1,800 basis points

00:52:12.360 --> 00:52:14.480
on some of these.

00:52:14.480 --> 00:52:17.270
But I'm not saying
it's separate.

00:52:17.270 --> 00:52:18.860
It's two business models.

00:52:18.860 --> 00:52:20.630
Let me churn on.

00:52:20.630 --> 00:52:23.330
AUDIENCE: I'm just going to
[INAUDIBLE] a brief question.

00:52:23.330 --> 00:52:24.710
Is that just for credit cards?

00:52:24.710 --> 00:52:26.520
Or is it debit cards as well?

00:52:26.520 --> 00:52:29.190
GARY GENSLER: So this
is for credit cards.

00:52:29.190 --> 00:52:33.350
Debit cards tended
to be about the same.

00:52:33.350 --> 00:52:37.490
But after the Dodd-Frank Act--
the regulatory reform bill here

00:52:37.490 --> 00:52:38.990
in the US--

00:52:38.990 --> 00:52:40.610
and the Durbin Amendment--

00:52:40.610 --> 00:52:42.890
Senator Dick Durbin of
Illinois had an amendment

00:52:42.890 --> 00:52:47.680
where debit cards had to be
priced closer to cost plus--

00:52:47.680 --> 00:52:50.920
I can't remember if it said
reasonable return on capital.

00:52:50.920 --> 00:52:53.840
And there was a Federal
Reserve rule making on that.

00:52:53.840 --> 00:52:57.080
Debit card numbers came down
significantly from this.

00:52:57.080 --> 00:52:58.650
I just don't know
the exact figures.

00:52:58.650 --> 00:53:01.100
But it's over 100 basis
points still on debit cards.

00:53:01.100 --> 00:53:04.230
But it's not 270.

00:53:04.230 --> 00:53:05.280
Good question.

00:53:05.280 --> 00:53:07.170
So I'm not going to go
through the details.

00:53:07.170 --> 00:53:10.818
But cross-border payments
have more complexity.

00:53:10.818 --> 00:53:12.610
I'm not going to go
through, but the paym--

00:53:12.610 --> 00:53:15.330
this is the what I'll
call the front end.

00:53:15.330 --> 00:53:18.570
You have a payer on the left
and a payee on the right.

00:53:18.570 --> 00:53:21.000
Think of somebody in the US
sending money to somebody

00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:23.970
in the Philippines, maybe.

00:53:23.970 --> 00:53:27.990
I need on my side a
payment system processor.

00:53:27.990 --> 00:53:29.400
That's the bubble on the top.

00:53:29.400 --> 00:53:32.490
I need them to have some
payment system processor.

00:53:32.490 --> 00:53:35.250
They're both ends
on the front end.

00:53:35.250 --> 00:53:41.760
So just think more complexity,
more friction in the system.

00:53:41.760 --> 00:53:45.270
And really the reason is, is
because you're jumping from one

00:53:45.270 --> 00:53:47.033
money to another money.

00:53:47.033 --> 00:53:49.200
Or another way you can think
of it as you're usually

00:53:49.200 --> 00:53:52.950
jumping from one ledger system
to another ledger system,

00:53:52.950 --> 00:53:57.060
if you're thinking like the
computers and recording.

00:53:57.060 --> 00:54:00.570
And the back end--

00:54:00.570 --> 00:54:03.630
I should have called this back
end, but I labeled both of them

00:54:03.630 --> 00:54:05.910
front end, sorry--

00:54:05.910 --> 00:54:09.138
has a bunch of
things inside of it.

00:54:09.138 --> 00:54:10.680
And the one I'm just
going to mention

00:54:10.680 --> 00:54:13.440
is correspondent banking.

00:54:13.440 --> 00:54:18.330
It is a feature that came
out of centuries of banking.

00:54:18.330 --> 00:54:21.370
Arguably, you might not
need it as much now.

00:54:21.370 --> 00:54:25.680
But the concept was, I'm a
small regional bank in the US.

00:54:25.680 --> 00:54:30.900
I'm sending something to
somebody in the Philippines.

00:54:30.900 --> 00:54:32.880
The Philippines
doesn't recognize

00:54:32.880 --> 00:54:35.730
this small regional bank,
let's say, in Kansas.

00:54:35.730 --> 00:54:38.880
I need a correspondent
bank that they can trust.

00:54:38.880 --> 00:54:43.380
So it's a cost of trust that
it could go from one country's

00:54:43.380 --> 00:54:50.630
bank through a bank called
a correspondent bank, which

00:54:50.630 --> 00:54:53.630
had trust, to the
other country's bank.

00:54:53.630 --> 00:54:55.610
Or maybe you even had
correspondent banks

00:54:55.610 --> 00:54:56.420
in both countries.

00:54:56.420 --> 00:55:01.850
But usually you had one
international bank in between.

00:55:01.850 --> 00:55:03.480
Hugo.

00:55:03.480 --> 00:55:08.130
AUDIENCE: Hypothetically,
if there became enough trust

00:55:08.130 --> 00:55:10.200
in the Bitcoin
network, could that

00:55:10.200 --> 00:55:12.900
act as the correspondent bank?

00:55:12.900 --> 00:55:16.290
Where like you're in the US,
you go to a Chase or whatever.

00:55:16.290 --> 00:55:18.450
They transfer your US
dollars to Bitcoin.

00:55:18.450 --> 00:55:20.398
You go over to the
Philippines, they transfer

00:55:20.398 --> 00:55:21.440
your Bitcoin [INAUDIBLE].

00:55:21.440 --> 00:55:23.430
There is no need for that.

00:55:23.430 --> 00:55:25.410
GARY GENSLER: So Hugo's
asking whether Bitcoin

00:55:25.410 --> 00:55:28.650
or any cryptocurrency could play
that role of a correspondent

00:55:28.650 --> 00:55:33.580
bank, or effectively play the
bridge currency between fiat

00:55:33.580 --> 00:55:37.270
to crypto, US dollar
to Bitcoin, you said.

00:55:37.270 --> 00:55:39.210
And what was the other country?

00:55:39.210 --> 00:55:40.780
The Philippines.

00:55:40.780 --> 00:55:43.190
Which is a peso?

00:55:43.190 --> 00:55:45.070
What's that?

00:55:45.070 --> 00:55:45.570
Peso.

00:55:45.570 --> 00:55:46.080
Yeah.

00:55:46.080 --> 00:55:51.450
So US dollar fiat to crypto
Bitcoin to Philippine peso.

00:55:51.450 --> 00:55:54.720
That is called a bridge
crypto or bridge currency.

00:55:54.720 --> 00:55:59.010
That's, in fact, what Ripple
is trying to do with XRP.

00:55:59.010 --> 00:56:04.950
So Ripple is a company that
started as a payment messaging

00:56:04.950 --> 00:56:08.730
service to compete with Swift.

00:56:08.730 --> 00:56:12.270
And that messaging
service, which

00:56:12.270 --> 00:56:16.110
we'll talk about more Thursday,
has been adopted by many banks.

00:56:16.110 --> 00:56:19.410
More recently in 2018 they
rolled out a prototype

00:56:19.410 --> 00:56:22.950
of using a crypto token--

00:56:22.950 --> 00:56:26.160
XRP-- as a bridge currency.

00:56:26.160 --> 00:56:28.530
I would say yes,
that is possible.

00:56:28.530 --> 00:56:33.990
I think there's an issue
also about volatility.

00:56:33.990 --> 00:56:41.510
So if you're moving fiat
dollar to crypto Bitcoin XRP

00:56:41.510 --> 00:56:47.920
to fiat, if you have
a lot of volatility,

00:56:47.920 --> 00:56:51.630
that means it's a less--

00:56:51.630 --> 00:56:53.560
it could be costly.

00:56:53.560 --> 00:56:56.110
But if it's stable
value, so you can

00:56:56.110 --> 00:56:58.900
you can lower the
cost two ways--

00:56:58.900 --> 00:57:04.160
lowering the volatility of
the crypto or lower the time.

00:57:04.160 --> 00:57:06.770
And XRP believes they
have a solution that

00:57:06.770 --> 00:57:09.120
can be down to seconds.

00:57:09.120 --> 00:57:12.290
And thus, even if it's
volatility, that in seconds

00:57:12.290 --> 00:57:13.385
it won't move as much.

00:57:13.385 --> 00:57:14.760
And the friction
will be that you

00:57:14.760 --> 00:57:21.360
have to sell dollars to buy XRP,
and then sell XRP to buy peso.

00:57:21.360 --> 00:57:25.110
Or you can interpose
any bridge currency.

00:57:25.110 --> 00:57:28.830
One of the most significant
opportunities for stable value

00:57:28.830 --> 00:57:31.830
tokens that we'll talk about
in a few classes is maybe

00:57:31.830 --> 00:57:34.170
is what we can call it
is a bridge currency

00:57:34.170 --> 00:57:36.017
for cross-border.

00:57:36.017 --> 00:57:36.600
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:57:36.600 --> 00:57:38.960
The question is, what
will be the fees?

00:57:38.960 --> 00:57:43.120
And if it makes sense from
an economic [INAUDIBLE]..

00:57:43.120 --> 00:57:46.620
GARY GENSLER: So Western Union
and other remittance companies

00:57:46.620 --> 00:57:49.500
can sometimes charge
as much as 9% or 10%,

00:57:49.500 --> 00:57:52.860
especially for small
dollar remittances.

00:57:52.860 --> 00:57:56.610
And I don't know if any of you
do cross-border remittances,

00:57:56.610 --> 00:58:01.230
but if it's small dollar, it
can be very significant fees.

00:58:01.230 --> 00:58:05.370
If it's large multi-million
dollar transactions,

00:58:05.370 --> 00:58:08.490
you're getting into
corporate treasury functions.

00:58:08.490 --> 00:58:13.055
So on the blockchain
payment solutions side,

00:58:13.055 --> 00:58:14.680
you have to always
think about, is this

00:58:14.680 --> 00:58:17.650
targeted for the retail
small dollar transactional

00:58:17.650 --> 00:58:20.920
side where you're trying to
get inside of an 8% to 10%

00:58:20.920 --> 00:58:22.900
fee structure?

00:58:22.900 --> 00:58:25.920
But again, if it's
only on $50 to $200

00:58:25.920 --> 00:58:28.920
US dollar sort of
transactions, you'd

00:58:28.920 --> 00:58:32.460
have to figure out how to get
your cost structure down there.

00:58:32.460 --> 00:58:34.710
Or is it for the
multi-million dollar treasury

00:58:34.710 --> 00:58:38.520
function, for the
Fortune 500 or the World

00:58:38.520 --> 00:58:41.790
1,000 or whatever
treasury function,

00:58:41.790 --> 00:58:43.860
where they're really
talking about frictions

00:58:43.860 --> 00:58:46.480
which are in basis points.

00:58:46.480 --> 00:58:50.740
But still, the bridge currency--
crypto bridge currencies--

00:58:50.740 --> 00:58:54.640
might still help in the
treasury function side--

00:58:54.640 --> 00:58:57.460
I'll call the corporate treasury
function side all the way

00:58:57.460 --> 00:59:00.820
to the retail remittance side.

00:59:00.820 --> 00:59:03.012
The percentage
fees are different.

00:59:03.012 --> 00:59:05.470
And you just have to be able
to say, well, can I get inside

00:59:05.470 --> 00:59:07.900
of those inefficiencies.

00:59:07.900 --> 00:59:10.990
And on the retail side
it takes two to five days

00:59:10.990 --> 00:59:12.920
to do a remittance.

00:59:12.920 --> 00:59:14.690
So can you get
inside the timing?

00:59:14.690 --> 00:59:15.190
Alin.

00:59:15.190 --> 00:59:16.565
ALIN DRAGOS: So
one of the things

00:59:16.565 --> 00:59:19.070
that I think I found useful
when I was doing remittances

00:59:19.070 --> 00:59:22.210
is trying to distinguish
between getting remittances

00:59:22.210 --> 00:59:23.510
from an account to an account.

00:59:23.510 --> 00:59:26.740
So account to account remittance
versus person to person.

00:59:26.740 --> 00:59:28.740
And I know they sound the
same, but they're not.

00:59:28.740 --> 00:59:29.240
Right.

00:59:29.240 --> 00:59:30.740
A person means,
hey, you know what?

00:59:30.740 --> 00:59:33.100
My mother out there doesn't
have a bank account.

00:59:33.100 --> 00:59:34.362
She's a person.

00:59:34.362 --> 00:59:36.070
If she were to have
an account, then that

00:59:36.070 --> 00:59:37.420
would be a fairly
easy transaction.

00:59:37.420 --> 00:59:37.920
Right.

00:59:37.920 --> 00:59:41.100
But is she doesn't have a bank
account, that's not that easy.

00:59:41.100 --> 00:59:43.030
Right?

00:59:43.030 --> 00:59:46.000
Most of the value that
all of these Western Union

00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:47.860
or whatever, they've
been valued by the fact

00:59:47.860 --> 00:59:49.150
that they have a
lot of locations,

00:59:49.150 --> 00:59:51.310
that people can walk in,
get their money, get out.

00:59:51.310 --> 00:59:52.090
Right?

00:59:52.090 --> 00:59:53.920
A lot of the folks that are
coming [INAUDIBLE] right now,

00:59:53.920 --> 00:59:56.170
they're trying to address this
account-to-acocunt problem.

00:59:56.170 --> 00:59:57.462
As in like, hey, you know what?

00:59:57.462 --> 00:59:59.230
If you have a bank
account here and a bank

00:59:59.230 --> 01:00:03.340
account in South Korea, that's
not that complicated, right?

01:00:03.340 --> 01:00:05.140
And cryptocurrency
can probably actually

01:00:05.140 --> 01:00:06.570
compete fairly well there.

01:00:06.570 --> 01:00:09.820
However, if you're trying
to say, hey, you know what?

01:00:09.820 --> 01:00:11.440
I have a bank account here.

01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:14.720
But my mother, who doesn't have
a bank account in South Korea,

01:00:14.720 --> 01:00:16.290
how do I get the money to her?

01:00:16.290 --> 01:00:18.597
If I send her cryptocurrency,
she's like, fine.

01:00:18.597 --> 01:00:19.930
What am I going to do with this?

01:00:19.930 --> 01:00:20.672
Right?

01:00:20.672 --> 01:00:22.630
So the real problem is,
you have to think about

01:00:22.630 --> 01:00:24.700
if you [INAUDIBLE]
the remittances, OK,

01:00:24.700 --> 01:00:27.922
where are the exit
ramps on both ends?

01:00:27.922 --> 01:00:30.130
How exactly are you going
to get that to actually use

01:00:30.130 --> 01:00:30.765
those funds?

01:00:30.765 --> 01:00:32.140
GARY GENSLER: And
also, right now

01:00:32.140 --> 01:00:37.750
because there's no
economy-wide use of crypto,

01:00:37.750 --> 01:00:42.080
if you're trying to move
value around the globe,

01:00:42.080 --> 01:00:46.060
on the other end it's probably
fiat to crypto, crypto to fiat.

01:00:46.060 --> 01:00:48.890
So it's probably
two money exchanges.

01:00:48.890 --> 01:00:52.130
If it's to be stored value,
if it's stored value,

01:00:52.130 --> 01:00:54.380
a lot of people are still
willing to store value

01:00:54.380 --> 01:00:54.980
in crypto.

01:00:54.980 --> 01:00:58.730
But until it grows
larger it's not

01:00:58.730 --> 01:01:02.840
a medium of exchange in
any economy-wide solution.

01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:05.252
So this is a slide
you've seen before.

01:01:05.252 --> 01:01:06.710
We're not going to
spend much time.

01:01:06.710 --> 01:01:09.950
But in payments some of
these matter and some don't.

01:01:09.950 --> 01:01:12.050
And I think if I did
my little thing--

01:01:12.050 --> 01:01:12.920
some will grow.

01:01:12.920 --> 01:01:13.460
All right.

01:01:13.460 --> 01:01:14.120
Yeah.

01:01:14.120 --> 01:01:15.170
There you go.

01:01:15.170 --> 01:01:16.800
All the illicit activity.

01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:19.490
Remember in public
policy there's

01:01:19.490 --> 01:01:21.650
something called the
Bank Secrecy Act.

01:01:21.650 --> 01:01:25.700
If you're thinking about
anything in the payment space,

01:01:25.700 --> 01:01:28.130
you're probably moving
something of value.

01:01:28.130 --> 01:01:30.020
And in almost every
country you have

01:01:30.020 --> 01:01:32.600
to comply with some form
of anti-money laundering,

01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:36.090
know your customer, Bank
Secrecy type of thing.

01:01:36.090 --> 01:01:40.370
The US Department
Treasury said so in 2013.

01:01:40.370 --> 01:01:44.520
You probably also have to deal
with some consumer protection.

01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:47.172
That's why that box on
the bottom sort of grew.

01:01:47.172 --> 01:01:49.130
Like, you're just not
going to lose their money

01:01:49.130 --> 01:01:50.880
or steal their money.

01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:53.270
And maybe something
about privacy,

01:01:53.270 --> 01:01:57.035
whether it's GDPR type of
privacy in Europe or elsewhere.

01:01:57.035 --> 01:01:58.910
You're not worried about
investor protection.

01:01:58.910 --> 01:02:00.860
But in this country,
you have to worry

01:02:00.860 --> 01:02:04.800
about how to register as
a money service provider.

01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:08.360
And other countries
similarly register.

01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:10.460
So I just raise that.

01:02:10.460 --> 01:02:12.983
And as we go through
use cases in H2,

01:02:12.983 --> 01:02:14.900
I'm going to constantly
kind of use this start

01:02:14.900 --> 01:02:17.300
and say, well, what
public policy issues?

01:02:17.300 --> 01:02:21.980
You don't have to worry
about the SEC, probably.

01:02:21.980 --> 01:02:24.020
But maybe some
stable value token

01:02:24.020 --> 01:02:26.240
might be an exchange
traded fund.

01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:28.940
So it's possible you
might be blurring up

01:02:28.940 --> 01:02:32.960
against that regulatory state.

01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:36.230
So technology is affecting us.

01:02:36.230 --> 01:02:39.582
And this is a slide I think
I've used before with everybody.

01:02:39.582 --> 01:02:41.040
But I thought,
well, wait a minute.

01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:42.740
What of these
eight-- and there's

01:02:42.740 --> 01:02:44.690
more technology affecting
finance-- but what

01:02:44.690 --> 01:02:47.180
are these main eight
are really hitting

01:02:47.180 --> 01:02:49.160
payments, when I add payments.

01:02:49.160 --> 01:02:51.650
Well, I'd say there's kind
of four or five of them.

01:02:51.650 --> 01:02:55.190
Blockchain is
affecting payments.

01:02:55.190 --> 01:02:57.650
But biometrics, we talked
about that earlier.

01:02:57.650 --> 01:02:58.730
Biometrics, definitely.

01:02:58.730 --> 01:03:03.320
Mobile telephony, open API,
which is the UK initiative

01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:08.880
where they're saying that UK
banks must allow merchants

01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:14.670
an ability to get inside of
those bank accounts, basically.

01:03:14.670 --> 01:03:18.510
It's called open API, because
they have an interface directly

01:03:18.510 --> 01:03:20.100
into the bank accounts.

01:03:20.100 --> 01:03:23.380
And even robotic
scraping of data--

01:03:23.380 --> 01:03:24.383
RPA.

01:03:24.383 --> 01:03:26.550
I think they're all related
to payments in some way.

01:03:26.550 --> 01:03:27.780
Or maybe everything.

01:03:27.780 --> 01:03:30.220
Maybe cloud and AI
and machine learning.

01:03:30.220 --> 01:03:31.230
But I kind of think--

01:03:31.230 --> 01:03:33.390
I think that these
five are the ones.

01:03:33.390 --> 01:03:36.180
So blockchain is amongst
the things changing payment.

01:03:36.180 --> 01:03:40.980
It's not the only thing
changing payments.

01:03:40.980 --> 01:03:46.650
And then remember a bunch
of attempts in the '90s?

01:03:46.650 --> 01:03:49.110
A bunch of ways to do
digital cash in the '90s?

01:03:49.110 --> 01:03:52.110
We talked about this in the
first or section lecture

01:03:52.110 --> 01:03:54.290
of the course.

01:03:54.290 --> 01:03:56.750
Fundamentally, why
did they all fail?

01:03:56.750 --> 01:03:59.110
Anybody remember
why they failed?

01:03:59.110 --> 01:04:01.318
AUDIENCE: They didn't solve
the double spend problem.

01:04:01.318 --> 01:04:03.890
GARY GENSLER: They didn't
solve the double spend problem.

01:04:03.890 --> 01:04:10.160
So bitcoin and blockchain
technology, Nakamoto consensus,

01:04:10.160 --> 01:04:14.170
is a solution to
the double spend.

01:04:14.170 --> 01:04:17.060
Nothing's 100% solution,
it has some challenges too.

01:04:17.060 --> 01:04:21.710
But it's a solution to
the double spend issue.

01:04:21.710 --> 01:04:28.900
So then before Bitcoin we had
a bunch of mobile payment,

01:04:28.900 --> 01:04:30.780
and now afterwards.

01:04:30.780 --> 01:04:32.980
And I want to spend
our last minutes

01:04:32.980 --> 01:04:36.700
kind of just chatting about
what are the lessons learning.

01:04:36.700 --> 01:04:39.370
So first, Alipay and WeChat.

01:04:39.370 --> 01:04:40.840
Who wants to tell
me a little bit?

01:04:40.840 --> 01:04:43.630
There's probably somebody--
who has Alipay and WeChat

01:04:43.630 --> 01:04:46.570
on their phones?

01:04:46.570 --> 01:04:48.440
Thalita, you want
to tell us about it?

01:04:48.440 --> 01:04:49.342
No?

01:04:49.342 --> 01:04:50.146
AUDIENCE: Go ahead.

01:04:50.146 --> 01:04:50.646
[INAUDIBLE]

01:04:50.646 --> 01:04:51.645
GARY GENSLER: Chris.

01:04:51.645 --> 01:04:52.270
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:04:52.270 --> 01:04:56.770
So WeChat was started
as just a chat service.

01:04:56.770 --> 01:04:59.290
So they built out
a huge user base,

01:04:59.290 --> 01:05:02.890
which is the key to the
similarity between WeChat

01:05:02.890 --> 01:05:03.975
and Alipay.

01:05:03.975 --> 01:05:06.100
And so essentially once
they had that chatter base,

01:05:06.100 --> 01:05:07.990
they wanted to
start monetizing it.

01:05:07.990 --> 01:05:11.560
And that's where the payment
system was added on top.

01:05:11.560 --> 01:05:14.710
GARY GENSLER: So when
WeChat and Alipay started,

01:05:14.710 --> 01:05:19.450
they started one, out of
communications, basically.

01:05:19.450 --> 01:05:20.940
Chat, text.

01:05:20.940 --> 01:05:22.120
Right?

01:05:22.120 --> 01:05:24.646
And Alipay was off of like--

01:05:24.646 --> 01:05:26.950
is it appropriate,
Shawn, to call it like,

01:05:26.950 --> 01:05:32.050
China's mixture of
eBay and Amazon.

01:05:32.050 --> 01:05:32.830
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:05:32.830 --> 01:05:33.810
P2P.

01:05:33.810 --> 01:05:34.720
GARY GENSLER: P2P.

01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:36.123
AUDIENCE: Or B2B.

01:05:36.123 --> 01:05:36.970
GARY GENSLER: B?

01:05:36.970 --> 01:05:38.428
AUDIENCE: Alibaba
is a B2B platform

01:05:38.428 --> 01:05:40.660
and combines an
e-commerce platform.

01:05:40.660 --> 01:05:43.840
So [INAUDIBLE]
combination service.

01:05:43.840 --> 01:05:46.210
GARY GENSLER: And those
payment channels--

01:05:46.210 --> 01:05:48.100
I don't think it's a surprise.

01:05:48.100 --> 01:05:52.330
China was not as developed in
terms of a credit card rails

01:05:52.330 --> 01:05:57.640
as the US, and had
far fewer banked.

01:05:57.640 --> 01:06:02.510
So these two companies
solved a problem that kind of

01:06:02.510 --> 01:06:04.160
existed because there was not--

01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:08.930
as it developed, banking
system and credit card systems.

01:06:08.930 --> 01:06:12.710
Overall, those systems
cost less than in the US

01:06:12.710 --> 01:06:15.760
then 270 basis points.

01:06:15.760 --> 01:06:17.720
And you had an article
in the readings

01:06:17.720 --> 01:06:21.430
that maybe the US payment
system is going to get shook up.

01:06:21.430 --> 01:06:22.430
I don't know the answer.

01:06:22.430 --> 01:06:26.330
But you know, maybe they'll
get shaken up by these two.

01:06:26.330 --> 01:06:28.490
How about the M-Pesa story?

01:06:28.490 --> 01:06:30.790
Anybody have any
M-Pesa on their phones?

01:06:30.790 --> 01:06:31.290
No.

01:06:33.940 --> 01:06:37.120
Who wants to give
a crack at M-Pesa?

01:06:37.120 --> 01:06:41.820
It's basically telephone,
mobile minutes.

01:06:41.820 --> 01:06:45.330
In all three of these,
the central banks

01:06:45.330 --> 01:06:49.080
saw a traditional
banking function--

01:06:49.080 --> 01:06:52.230
payments, and a second
traditional banking

01:06:52.230 --> 01:06:57.882
function-- the store of value,
being done by non-banks.

01:06:57.882 --> 01:06:59.340
What do you think
the central banks

01:06:59.340 --> 01:07:03.440
in the official sector did?

01:07:03.440 --> 01:07:05.270
AUDIENCE: They
came in and started

01:07:05.270 --> 01:07:07.760
to regulate those [INAUDIBLE].

01:07:07.760 --> 01:07:10.700
For example, we now are
reading, they talk about M-Pesa.

01:07:10.700 --> 01:07:14.030
Actually, the Kenya
government oversaw the trust

01:07:14.030 --> 01:07:18.290
so that even Vodaphone
ran out of the business,

01:07:18.290 --> 01:07:21.608
people can still use the
money stored with the M-Pesa.

01:07:21.608 --> 01:07:23.150
GARY GENSLER: So
let's break it down.

01:07:23.150 --> 01:07:26.510
So one is, the official
sector said, whoa.

01:07:26.510 --> 01:07:30.790
We've got to bring this inside
the public policy framework.

01:07:30.790 --> 01:07:33.290
Regulate it.

01:07:33.290 --> 01:07:37.820
And then two, they
said in the Kenya case,

01:07:37.820 --> 01:07:41.630
it's gotta be set up as a trust.

01:07:41.630 --> 01:07:44.540
And the value--
the stored value--

01:07:44.540 --> 01:07:48.410
has to be in the banking
system, literally.

01:07:48.410 --> 01:07:51.050
So all those little--

01:07:51.050 --> 01:07:52.050
Eric?

01:07:52.050 --> 01:07:55.310
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I just
wanted to add one example

01:07:55.310 --> 01:07:58.340
to your list that actually
is the opposite of what

01:07:58.340 --> 01:07:59.760
[INAUDIBLE] described.

01:07:59.760 --> 01:08:02.175
[INAUDIBLE] which is Peru modal.

01:08:02.175 --> 01:08:03.800
And it's the initiative
[INAUDIBLE]----

01:08:03.800 --> 01:08:05.090
GARY GENSLER: Peru--

01:08:05.090 --> 01:08:06.177
AUDIENCE: Peru modal.

01:08:06.177 --> 01:08:07.010
GARY GENSLER: Modal.

01:08:07.010 --> 01:08:07.635
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:08:07.635 --> 01:08:14.030
And it was tackled or begun
by a former production

01:08:14.030 --> 01:08:16.550
minister in Peru,
who actually thought

01:08:16.550 --> 01:08:18.920
about that potential issue.

01:08:18.920 --> 01:08:25.250
And she started reaching
out to all local banks

01:08:25.250 --> 01:08:29.450
and all local telcos,
brought them all together

01:08:29.450 --> 01:08:33.520
and created a whole
model that's called

01:08:33.520 --> 01:08:38.330
[SPANISH] which is
mobile wallet in Spanish.

01:08:38.330 --> 01:08:44.000
And it's been growing
since 2016 as a means

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:47.960
of financial inclusion for
underserved populations

01:08:47.960 --> 01:08:51.560
and people that don't
have bank accounts.

01:08:51.560 --> 01:08:53.779
Because banks see
that as an opportunity

01:08:53.779 --> 01:08:55.707
to get more customers.

01:08:55.707 --> 01:08:58.040
GARY GENSLER: So Eric, can I
ask you a couple questions?

01:08:58.040 --> 01:09:01.130
Do you know, was it a
means for just payment?

01:09:01.130 --> 01:09:04.840
Or did they actually store
value in this system?

01:09:04.840 --> 01:09:05.810
AUDIENCE: It's both.

01:09:05.810 --> 01:09:07.000
Yeah.

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:11.260
You can use your mobile
to pay to another person,

01:09:11.260 --> 01:09:14.439
to a merchant, for
example, a small store

01:09:14.439 --> 01:09:16.630
with another mobile.

01:09:16.630 --> 01:09:19.509
Or you can actually
cash it out to a--

01:09:20.521 --> 01:09:22.229
GARY GENSLER: Has it
been brought inside?

01:09:22.229 --> 01:09:24.776
Is it now being regulated
as a financial firm?

01:09:24.776 --> 01:09:26.109
AUDIENCE: We got them regulated.

01:09:26.109 --> 01:09:28.590
And begun with a--

01:09:28.590 --> 01:09:31.149
it's now a spinoff as a--

01:09:31.149 --> 01:09:32.790
what we call sociedad
anonima, which

01:09:32.790 --> 01:09:35.500
is some sort of private company.

01:09:35.500 --> 01:09:40.540
But it's basically a consortium
of all the banks in Peru.

01:09:40.540 --> 01:09:43.120
GARY GENSLER: So if you can
send me an email with its name,

01:09:43.120 --> 01:09:43.740
I'd love that.

01:09:43.740 --> 01:09:46.359
And maybe I'll put something
on Canvas about it.

01:09:46.359 --> 01:09:49.240
But in all these circumstances,
they were payments.

01:09:49.240 --> 01:09:51.790
But they also had--

01:09:51.790 --> 01:09:53.290
they started storing value.

01:09:53.290 --> 01:09:56.530
The other one I want to
mention is Starbucks.

01:09:56.530 --> 01:09:57.290
Starbucks.

01:09:57.290 --> 01:09:59.530
How many people have
Starbucks on their phone?

01:09:59.530 --> 01:10:01.900
And they have-- right?

01:10:01.900 --> 01:10:03.820
So wait a minute.

01:10:03.820 --> 01:10:04.330
Wait.

01:10:04.330 --> 01:10:05.900
I saw a hand back there.

01:10:05.900 --> 01:10:06.810
Larry.

01:10:06.810 --> 01:10:07.310
Geez.

01:10:07.310 --> 01:10:09.460
I'm going to call on you, then.

01:10:09.460 --> 01:10:10.180
Who knew?

01:10:10.180 --> 01:10:10.780
All right.

01:10:10.780 --> 01:10:12.695
Does it store value?

01:10:12.695 --> 01:10:13.320
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:10:13.320 --> 01:10:14.380
It steals value.

01:10:14.380 --> 01:10:17.340
Like, you have a minimum
amount you have to deposit.

01:10:17.340 --> 01:10:19.270
So $20, for example.

01:10:19.270 --> 01:10:21.670
Whenever it goes below the
minimum, it kicks another 20

01:10:21.670 --> 01:10:22.170
in.

01:10:22.170 --> 01:10:24.310
So you never-- so they've
basically taken $20

01:10:24.310 --> 01:10:26.440
and held it permanently.

01:10:26.440 --> 01:10:29.050
GARY GENSLER: So they're taking
it out of your bank account.

01:10:29.050 --> 01:10:29.550
Right?

01:10:29.550 --> 01:10:31.630
You gave them authorization--
back to that word

01:10:31.630 --> 01:10:33.220
"authorization"--

01:10:33.220 --> 01:10:36.490
to just take money out
of your bank account.

01:10:36.490 --> 01:10:40.270
So this is a form
of what used to be

01:10:40.270 --> 01:10:42.250
when Larry and I were kids.

01:10:42.250 --> 01:10:46.990
you could have physical
prepaid cards, gift cards.

01:10:46.990 --> 01:10:49.196
I got them on my birthday.

01:10:49.196 --> 01:10:50.620
It's a gift card.

01:10:50.620 --> 01:10:57.380
But now it's sort of prepaid
cards on your mobile |

01:10:57.380 --> 01:11:01.790
I think if Starbucks
had billions of dollars

01:11:01.790 --> 01:11:06.380
in everybody's $20, that
the US Federal Reserve might

01:11:06.380 --> 01:11:09.020
knock on their door
and say, you've

01:11:09.020 --> 01:11:11.740
got to register as a
bank, or you've got to--

01:11:11.740 --> 01:11:18.080
In China, basically, that's
what happened to Alibaba.

01:11:18.080 --> 01:11:22.400
The largest money market
fund in the whole world

01:11:22.400 --> 01:11:24.970
is at And Financial Alipay.

01:11:24.970 --> 01:11:25.610
Largest.

01:11:25.610 --> 01:11:27.950
About $300 billion US dollars.

01:11:27.950 --> 01:11:32.090
But I think the same would
happen with Starbucks,

01:11:32.090 --> 01:11:34.400
because they're storing value.

01:11:34.400 --> 01:11:37.550
And Kenya, they said you've
got to put it in a trust.

01:11:37.550 --> 01:11:40.550
And by the way, we want
you to make deposits

01:11:40.550 --> 01:11:43.620
with 100% of this in
the banking system.

01:11:43.620 --> 01:11:45.650
And that official
sector said, we

01:11:45.650 --> 01:11:48.900
don't want to dis-intermediate
the commercial banks.

01:11:48.900 --> 01:11:51.350
Now, they didn't write
that in a statement.

01:11:51.350 --> 01:11:55.190
They probably couched it
all in consumer protection.

01:11:55.190 --> 01:11:58.150
But at the essence,
the outcome was,

01:11:58.150 --> 01:11:59.900
they were keeping their
commercial banking

01:11:59.900 --> 01:12:03.140
system alive by doing it.

01:12:03.140 --> 01:12:05.510
Starbucks, I don't know
what they're doing,

01:12:05.510 --> 01:12:06.545
Larry, with your $20.

01:12:09.330 --> 01:12:11.560
But you don't, either.

01:12:11.560 --> 01:12:12.060
No.

01:12:12.060 --> 01:12:13.435
But I don't think
it's a surprise

01:12:13.435 --> 01:12:19.200
that Starbucks has partnered
with Intercontinental Exchange.

01:12:19.200 --> 01:12:21.510
And you should
ask Jeff and Kelly

01:12:21.510 --> 01:12:24.010
when they're with us, well,
why is that connection?

01:12:24.010 --> 01:12:24.510
I'm sorry.

01:12:24.510 --> 01:12:25.718
There were a couple of hands.

01:12:25.718 --> 01:12:27.428
I saw Jihee And I saw Alin.

01:12:27.428 --> 01:12:29.220
AUDIENCE: Well, we just
wanted to point out

01:12:29.220 --> 01:12:32.510
that you probably had set--

01:12:32.510 --> 01:12:34.955
set the auto subscriber, or--

01:12:34.955 --> 01:12:35.773
OK.

01:12:35.773 --> 01:12:37.440
GARY GENSLER: You can
tell Larry advice.

01:12:37.440 --> 01:12:39.072
How did he set his
auto subscriber?

01:12:39.072 --> 01:12:39.780
Oh, that's right.

01:12:39.780 --> 01:12:42.250
I mean, I could physically
have to go through every time I

01:12:42.250 --> 01:12:43.160
want to reload.

01:12:43.160 --> 01:12:45.650
But obviously, that's
just wasting my time.

01:12:45.650 --> 01:12:47.570
So.

01:12:47.570 --> 01:12:48.900
It's like the internet.

01:12:48.900 --> 01:12:51.490
That I'm losing is
probably worth my time.

01:12:51.490 --> 01:12:53.280
So I'm not saying
I have [INAUDIBLE]..

01:12:53.280 --> 01:12:54.090
But it is amazing.

01:12:54.090 --> 01:12:56.947
There must be an extraordinary
amount of money [INAUDIBLE]

01:12:56.947 --> 01:12:57.780
GARY GENSLER: Oh no.

01:12:57.780 --> 01:12:59.130
They're doing you a service.

01:12:59.130 --> 01:13:00.420
I'm not saying they're
not doing you a service.

01:13:00.420 --> 01:13:01.962
Let me take one
more, Priya, then I'm

01:13:01.962 --> 01:13:03.510
going to go to [INAUDIBLE].

01:13:03.510 --> 01:13:07.290
AUDIENCE: Interesting back story
to the M-Pesa Safaricom fees.

01:13:07.290 --> 01:13:09.870
I used to work for
one of the NGOs

01:13:09.870 --> 01:13:14.160
that pioneered the savings and
loans concept in all of Africa,

01:13:14.160 --> 01:13:15.300
really.

01:13:15.300 --> 01:13:17.610
And what happened in
Kenya was that you

01:13:17.610 --> 01:13:21.000
had these groups, like
hundreds of thousands of them,

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.070
in very remote places.

01:13:23.070 --> 01:13:25.758
And these groups, you know,
they had annual saving cycles.

01:13:25.758 --> 01:13:28.300
And eventually, you know, they
were saving very little money.

01:13:28.300 --> 01:13:29.850
But they were saving.

01:13:29.850 --> 01:13:33.540
And they didn't have
a way to then move

01:13:33.540 --> 01:13:34.862
into the formal economy.

01:13:34.862 --> 01:13:36.570
You know, so the money
just stayed there.

01:13:36.570 --> 01:13:39.300
And it literally was money
stored in a box with three

01:13:39.300 --> 01:13:41.280
locks, and they were--

01:13:41.280 --> 01:13:44.070
And you know, it was a way
that even without literacy you

01:13:44.070 --> 01:13:45.090
could do it.

01:13:45.090 --> 01:13:49.410
At that time, DFID, the British
overseas development agency,

01:13:49.410 --> 01:13:53.170
was sponsoring a few of
these NGOs to do this work.

01:13:53.170 --> 01:13:55.080
And the consortium's
biggest problem

01:13:55.080 --> 01:13:58.980
was, now how did we-- the next
step up is to transition them

01:13:58.980 --> 01:14:01.835
into the formal economy
and gain access to credit.

01:14:01.835 --> 01:14:03.210
It was like the
opposite approach

01:14:03.210 --> 01:14:05.070
of the micro [INAUDIBLE].

01:14:05.070 --> 01:14:07.890
And that's the point when
in Kenya this breakthrough

01:14:07.890 --> 01:14:11.920
happened is when these savings
groups finally had some money.

01:14:11.920 --> 01:14:14.820
And the first thing that
happened at their villages--

01:14:14.820 --> 01:14:17.610
like, no bank was
going to open a branch.

01:14:17.610 --> 01:14:20.340
There was a movement
around mobile branches.

01:14:20.340 --> 01:14:23.220
But even that was very expensive
for the amount of money

01:14:23.220 --> 01:14:25.630
that each of these
scripts was saving.

01:14:25.630 --> 01:14:28.740
And so then these first
operators came up.

01:14:28.740 --> 01:14:31.230
It was almost like an act
of frustration, you know.

01:14:31.230 --> 01:14:32.130
Like, OK.

01:14:32.130 --> 01:14:35.577
We have this cash in this
box that cannot be stored.

01:14:35.577 --> 01:14:36.910
So now we're just going to move.

01:14:36.910 --> 01:14:38.480
GARY GENSLER: So
let me capture it.

01:14:38.480 --> 01:14:43.170
So some of the themes is that
where there is a market gap,

01:14:43.170 --> 01:14:47.040
there is a gap in
Kenya with unbanked.

01:14:47.040 --> 01:14:49.770
And by the way, half
of sub-Saharan Africa

01:14:49.770 --> 01:14:52.470
is still unbanked.

01:14:52.470 --> 01:14:56.760
But half of that unbanked
have mobile phones.

01:14:56.760 --> 01:14:59.790
But there is a gap in China.

01:14:59.790 --> 01:15:04.590
And so Alipay and WeChat and
so forth started to fill it.

01:15:04.590 --> 01:15:10.710
What gaps are there today
that you all can fill.

01:15:10.710 --> 01:15:14.190
And then secondly, does a
blockchain technology solution

01:15:14.190 --> 01:15:17.350
help fill that gap?

01:15:17.350 --> 01:15:20.890
There might be big gaps
created by 275 basis

01:15:20.890 --> 01:15:25.000
points in the US,
the 2 and 3/4 percent

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.790
using the credit card
rails for payments.

01:15:27.790 --> 01:15:30.490
There might be gaps
of the unbanked.

01:15:30.490 --> 01:15:35.860
There might be big gaps in
customer user interface,

01:15:35.860 --> 01:15:37.450
because a lot of
the customer user

01:15:37.450 --> 01:15:42.340
interface in current
banking isn't that great

01:15:42.340 --> 01:15:44.680
as we move to mobile phones.

01:15:44.680 --> 01:15:45.655
QR codes.

01:15:49.270 --> 01:15:51.630
There was a nice comment--

01:15:51.630 --> 01:15:55.090
see, if you do comment, I
remember what you say online.

01:15:55.090 --> 01:15:57.460
But there was a nice
comment about QR codes.

01:15:57.460 --> 01:16:00.790
Where are QR codes used in
payment most dominantly?

01:16:00.790 --> 01:16:01.750
Two countries.

01:16:01.750 --> 01:16:02.650
What?

01:16:02.650 --> 01:16:04.600
China and India.

01:16:07.260 --> 01:16:10.500
The US, and I would
even contend Europe,

01:16:10.500 --> 01:16:14.600
are no longer at the
forefront of payments.

01:16:14.600 --> 01:16:18.110
Because we're sort of had
existing big legacy systems.

01:16:18.110 --> 01:16:21.380
But that might mean that there
is big legacy systems built

01:16:21.380 --> 01:16:23.660
on the credit card
rails dominantly,

01:16:23.660 --> 01:16:25.170
might be vulnerable.

01:16:25.170 --> 01:16:29.090
A quick thing just
on the methods.

01:16:29.090 --> 01:16:31.700
This was out of a report
you had, but I just thought

01:16:31.700 --> 01:16:35.300
in 2016, 29% stole credit card.

01:16:35.300 --> 01:16:39.410
Estimate, five years from
now worldwide down to 15%.

01:16:39.410 --> 01:16:42.500
eWallet is 18% to 46%.

01:16:42.500 --> 01:16:45.650
Those trends, if they're
right, and of course,

01:16:45.650 --> 01:16:48.710
they won't be exactly
right, but those trends

01:16:48.710 --> 01:16:51.380
creates opportunity.

01:16:51.380 --> 01:16:55.250
When you have huge changes,
and people are changing the way

01:16:55.250 --> 01:16:57.410
they're doing things,
that's usually where

01:16:57.410 --> 01:17:00.020
business opportunities are.

01:17:00.020 --> 01:17:03.810
You had-- this is too detailed.

01:17:03.810 --> 01:17:05.690
But I think it's
sort of fascinating

01:17:05.690 --> 01:17:09.590
that the Federal Reserve
puts this out once a year.

01:17:09.590 --> 01:17:11.250
It's always old, stale data.

01:17:11.250 --> 01:17:13.850
But the big things
I took away is

01:17:13.850 --> 01:17:15.650
that we've got a
huge change that's

01:17:15.650 --> 01:17:19.970
happening here even in the US.

01:17:19.970 --> 01:17:24.290
And card payments still
growing, of course.

01:17:24.290 --> 01:17:26.210
But not like they once were.

01:17:26.210 --> 01:17:27.800
Mobile payments
are big changing.

01:17:27.800 --> 01:17:30.470
Half of all card payments
are done online, by the way,

01:17:30.470 --> 01:17:33.740
not in person now.

01:17:33.740 --> 01:17:35.350
So those statistics,
if you're going

01:17:35.350 --> 01:17:37.790
to build a real business
and not just a business

01:17:37.790 --> 01:17:41.780
for a final project
for Gensler's course,

01:17:41.780 --> 01:17:44.450
you're going to want to
dive into these statistics.

01:17:44.450 --> 01:17:46.500
You want to see where
are the opportunities.

01:17:46.500 --> 01:17:50.720
What are the trends
in the statistics.

01:17:50.720 --> 01:17:52.720
And then Bitcoin came along.

01:17:52.720 --> 01:17:54.860
And we're not
going to chat more,

01:17:54.860 --> 01:18:00.360
but I'm going to just say,
just as the two minutes left,

01:18:00.360 --> 01:18:02.160
don't forget the economics.

01:18:02.160 --> 01:18:04.410
And I say this again
coming back to having read

01:18:04.410 --> 01:18:07.050
50 papers over the weekend.

01:18:07.050 --> 01:18:11.370
When you're writing for
the rest of the semester,

01:18:11.370 --> 01:18:12.290
whatever section--

01:18:12.290 --> 01:18:14.040
whether you write on
payments, whether you

01:18:14.040 --> 01:18:17.610
write on central bank, whatever
you write one, remember

01:18:17.610 --> 01:18:21.690
about thinking about what
are the benefits of block J.

01:18:21.690 --> 01:18:23.280
What are the real specifics?

01:18:23.280 --> 01:18:25.770
And particularly, how
does it lower verification

01:18:25.770 --> 01:18:26.890
or networking costs?

01:18:26.890 --> 01:18:28.890
Like Christian
Catalini wrote about,

01:18:28.890 --> 01:18:30.720
but just we talked about it.

01:18:30.720 --> 01:18:32.070
Coming to my office.

01:18:32.070 --> 01:18:33.120
Ask for office hours.

01:18:33.120 --> 01:18:34.140
Say, wait a minute.

01:18:34.140 --> 01:18:38.530
How does-- does it really
need to happen this way?

01:18:38.530 --> 01:18:42.000
And most importantly,
what are the net benefits?

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.040
And I keep coming to
my friend Brotish.

01:18:44.040 --> 01:18:46.860
No, don't do a
traditional database.

01:18:46.860 --> 01:18:50.710
You gotta get to a
private blockchain.

01:18:50.710 --> 01:18:53.540
This is not a traditional
database course.

01:18:53.540 --> 01:18:55.740
We're about permission
blockchains or permissionless

01:18:55.740 --> 01:18:56.890
blockchain.

01:18:56.890 --> 01:19:01.250
And remember, blockchains
are about append-only logs

01:19:01.250 --> 01:19:04.130
with some consensus
with multiple parties

01:19:04.130 --> 01:19:08.690
having the right to change
the state of the ledger.

01:19:08.690 --> 01:19:11.140
So it's sort of like,
when does that valuable?

01:19:11.140 --> 01:19:13.640
I believe there
is value to that.

01:19:13.640 --> 01:19:15.700
But not in every circumstance.

01:19:15.700 --> 01:19:18.040
And certainly if there
is a native token,

01:19:18.040 --> 01:19:19.540
why do you need a native token?

01:19:19.540 --> 01:19:22.360
Is it there to jump
start a network?

01:19:22.360 --> 01:19:25.120
Is it to help with
token economics?

01:19:25.120 --> 01:19:28.300
Remembering that there is
great network effects to having

01:19:28.300 --> 01:19:31.620
one currency per jurisdiction.

01:19:31.620 --> 01:19:35.310
But let's not forget that
certain multi-jurisdiction

01:19:35.310 --> 01:19:37.560
currencies have failed.

01:19:37.560 --> 01:19:39.870
The history of
multi-jurisdiction currencies

01:19:39.870 --> 01:19:42.000
is they almost always fail.

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.700
We still have not
seen the end or what's

01:19:44.700 --> 01:19:46.350
going to happen with the URL.

01:19:46.350 --> 01:19:48.510
I mean, decades from
now, I'm saying.

01:19:48.510 --> 01:19:52.240
And don't forget the skins
and the swords as well.

01:19:52.240 --> 01:19:54.175
So we're back together
again on Thursday.

01:19:54.175 --> 01:19:55.800
We're going to do
payments on that day.

01:19:55.800 --> 01:19:59.100
We're going to dive more into
payments-- actual blockchain

01:19:59.100 --> 01:20:01.260
technology stuff and payments.

01:20:01.260 --> 01:20:02.830
Thank you, Alin.

01:20:02.830 --> 01:20:06.480
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:21.260 --> 00:01:46.690
PROFESSOR: All right, so let's
do our first clicker question.

00:01:46.690 --> 00:02:03.620
All right, let's just
do 10 more seconds.

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:10.850
Interesting.

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:15.560
So, in this problem you were
given the maximum rate, Vmax,

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.710
which, by the way, you
calculated in class last time.

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:22.710
And then said what will the
substrate concentration be

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:25.850
when you have half
of that rate.

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.590
And so, when you have half of
the maximum rate, that's the

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.310
definition of k m.

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.330
So all you have to do is if a
k m is given, you just write

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.370
down that value.

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.420
So that's the level
of question you'll

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.840
get on enzyme kinetics.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.790
All right, so that should be
a good tie breaker, too.

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.170
All right, so in this little
review and we talk about the

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:53.110
material from the second half of
the course, and why I think

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:57.110
this material is really
important and cool, and that's

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.450
because it all represents the
basic principles of how

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:01.500
enzymes work.

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.270
And as a biochemist, I recognize
this material is

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:05.350
really important.

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:08.090
So that's what interests me
particularly about it.

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.790
And the point that I want to
make in general is that when

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.030
you're studying introductory
material, sometimes it seems

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.000
like you're never going to
really need that material

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.740
again, but that's because you
haven't seen the connection

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:20.710
between it in other topics.

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:24.310
So, a lot of the things you've
learned will be related to

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.340
things that you're going
to see you later on.

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.890
So I'm going to give you
examples and review examples

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.860
of how the material you've
learned will allow you to

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.360
understand an enzyme,
for example.

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.090
So, we talked last time that one
reason why you care about

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.450
understanding how an enzyme
works is because a lot of

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:43.390
people want to inhibit
enzymes.

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:47.170
Well, why would you want to
inhibit enzymes, and that's

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:50.290
because inhibiting enzymes
is very useful to

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:51.770
treat a bunch of things.

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:55.470
A number of you will, in the
next week, I'm pretty sure, be

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.980
interested in ways to inhibit
enzymes to prevent headaches

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:02.000
or to decrease headaches.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.970
And this is true of students
and faculty

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:06.310
during finals week.

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:11.950
And so, some of the treatments
for headaches that a number of

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.890
those pharmaceuticals are geared
toward enzymes called

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:18.390
prostaglandin synthesis, and
they inhibit those enzyme from

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:21.220
working and that gets rid
of your headache.

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.950
Arthritis, for example, is also
treated by a lot of the

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:27.370
same medications that
treat headaches.

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:33.320
Cancer, often chemotherapy
or you're giving people

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:37.450
inhibitors of enzymes to
decrease tumor growth.

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:41.390
And we talked last time about
inhibiting HIV proteases as

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:46.170
part of a treatment for HIV. So,
understanding enzymes is

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:49.550
very important for the
pharmaceutical industry, and

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:52.160
so that's one example of why
you need to know about

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.350
chemical equilibrium, why you
need to know about acid based

00:04:55.350 --> 00:05:00.870
oxidation reduction transition
metals, and also kinetics.

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:02.610
So, I'm going to give
you a case study.

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:04.440
You've seen some of these
examples before, but we're

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.250
going to put them all
together now.

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:11.290
And I try in every lecture, if I
can, to mention vitamin B12,

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:14.010
and here, we're going to tell
you about a vitamin B12

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:18.460
dependent enzyme, and how
knowing what you know now

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:21.600
about these topics would allow
you to understand how this

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:25.580
enzyme works.

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:29.360
So, first, kinetics, this is
easy, methionine synthase,

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.620
it's an enzyme.

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:35.960
So, what does this enzyme do?

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:39.340
So this particular enzyme
converts an amino acid called

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:43.440
homocysteine to another amino
acid, methionine.

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:48.070
It also converts another
vitamin, a B vitamin, the

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:50.780
methyltetrahydrofolate form to
tetrahydrofolate, so this

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:55.860
folate is one your B vitamins.

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:57.120
Why do you care?

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:01.220
Well, methionine is needed for
proper formation of brain and

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:06.040
spinal column, and it's
particularly important when

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:09.350
women are pregnant that they
have enough folic acid so that

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:11.480
they can make enough
methionine.

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:14.510
If they do not have enough folic
acid, then you can have

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:17.280
babies born with neural
tube defects.

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:20.600
Also, as I mentioned before,
inhibiting methionine synthase

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:25.140
raises homocysteine levels, so
you can't do this conversion,

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:27.680
and that increases risk
of heart disease that

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:30.540
homocysteine is actually a
really good indicator, high

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:33.180
homocysteine levels of whether
someone's going to have heart

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:35.030
trouble or not.

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:38.770
This is also a target for
chemotherapy, because you need

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:43.820
tetrahydrofolate to do DNA
biosynthesis, and tumor cells

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:47.670
that are growing, tumors that
are growing, need a lot of DNA

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:47.980
biosynthesis.

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:51.740
So if you inhibit this enzyme,
you can inhibit DNA

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:54.300
biosynthesis, so it's
a potential

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:58.030
chemotherapeutic target.

00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:00.170
There is some use of
this in Europe.

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:03.590
Actually there is a treatment
that's given that's

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:05.060
specifically supposed to inhibit
methione synthase,

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:11.030
it's not used so much in this
country, but laughing gas will

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:12.920
inhibit methione synthase.

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:15.750
And so, in Europe some cancer
patients are treated with

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:19.580
laughing gas as a way to
decrease their tumors.

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:22.940
I'm not sure it's the most
effective therapy, but they're

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:24.440
at least pretty happy with it.

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:29.950
So that's the counterpart.

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:32.860
So, this is an important
enzyme.

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:39.840
And enzymes, of course, as we
know are catalysts and they

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:44.440
catalyze reactions, so tell me
what you know about catalysts.

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:46.350
Which is the following
statements about

00:07:46.350 --> 00:08:37.690
catalysts are true?

00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:52.700
OK, let's take 10 more seconds.

00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:58.100
Very good.

00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:01.120
All right, so going
back to the notes,

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:04.560
statement 2 is true.

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:09.350
So, catalysts work by lowering
the activation energy barrier

00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:12.180
for both the forward and
the reverse reaction.

00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:15.340
So both rates would
be changed.

00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:18.850
And also, catalysts are not
going to affect the

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:21.280
thermodynamics, they're not
going to shift the equilibrium

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:23.050
toward products.

00:09:23.050 --> 00:09:25.060
What's something that you
could use to shift an

00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:28.840
equilibrium, say, to products
or reactants.

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:30.710
Temperature, yeah.

00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:33.820
So, just a little review
of kinetics.

00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:37.120
Again, a catalyst works by
lowering the activation energy

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:41.140
barrier, or another way to say
that is by stabilizing a

00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:47.040
transition state, so it's going
to affect the activation

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:48.640
energy for the forward
reaction.

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:51.950
And for the reverse reaction,
it's going to decrease both of

00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:53.760
them by the same amount.

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:56.350
So if you know how much one is
decreased, you also know how

00:09:56.350 --> 00:09:58.140
much the other is decreased.

00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:02.010
And we also know that it
doesn't affect the

00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:02.810
thermodynamics.

00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:06.620
So, does it change the
equilibrium constant?

00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:10.740
No, it doesn't change the
equilibrium constant.

00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:13.420
All right, so a little
review of kinetics.

00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:16.390
So now let's talk about
transition metals.

00:10:16.390 --> 00:10:19.520
So this particular enzyme needs
2 different kinds of

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:20.680
transition metals.

00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:24.830
It needs cobalt in the form of
vitamin B12 and it also needs

00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:31.650
zinc. So we talked about
methylcobalamin, so cobalamin

00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:34.680
is another name for
vitamin B12.

00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:37.900
And here we have a methyl
ligand, c h 3 is a methyl

00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:42.140
ligand coordinated to the cobalt
in the center, and we

00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:47.160
saw before that when you have a
thing that forms attachments

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:50.810
at more than one point, it's
called a chelate, so the corn

00:10:50.810 --> 00:10:54.270
ring here is a chelating agent,
and it's a tetradentate

00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:58.020
ligand because there are
4 points of attachment.

00:10:58.020 --> 00:10:59.680
So we can have monodentate,
bidentate, tetradentate,

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:05.100
hexadentate, and tell you
the number of points of

00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:06.720
attachment.

00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:11.260
And again, this is a chelate,
and what do you know about a

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:12.220
chelate effect?

00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:15.450
I want someone to tell me what
the chelate effect is, and

00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:18.550
there's a special bonus
prize of a teeshirt

00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:19.690
for the best answer.

00:11:19.690 --> 00:11:21.620
Who wants to give it a try
and tell me what the

00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:25.860
chelate effect is.

00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:26.750
Any volunteers?

00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:39.640
Bonus teeshirt.

00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:43.290
Who wants to give it a try.

00:11:43.290 --> 00:11:50.500
Not very brave.

00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:55.760
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:58.440
PROFESSOR: OK, so chelate, it's
something that's going to

00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:03.490
be binding to a metal at
multiple points of attachment.

00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:07.820
And what do we know about how
stable or how favorable that

00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:08.940
kind of interaction is?

00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:17.240
STUDENT: It makes it more stable
because [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:27.810
PROFESSOR: Are you reading
from your notes?

00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:28.830
Well, you know what, I didn't
say that was not allowed, so

00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:28.850
congratulations.

00:12:28.850 --> 00:12:31.640
Right, so chelates are unusually
stable due to

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:33.480
entropic affects.

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:35.740
So it's an entropy affect.

00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:38.390
So if you have a metal that's
free in solution, it's going

00:12:38.390 --> 00:12:41.750
to bind to a lot of water
molecules, and often, metals

00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:43.210
like to bind to thick things.

00:12:43.210 --> 00:12:45.790
You see a lot of octahedral
complexes.

00:12:45.790 --> 00:12:49.240
So if you have a metal bound to
6 waters, and you bring in

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:52.430
a chelate that will blind with
multiple points of attachment,

00:12:52.430 --> 00:12:57.010
such as EDTA, which binds at 6
points of attachment, that 1

00:12:57.010 --> 00:13:01.230
molecule of EDTA will displace
6 water molecules.

00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:04.110
So that is going to be
entropically favorable.

00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:07.450
6 things floating around in
solution have a lot more

00:13:07.450 --> 00:13:10.360
entropy than 1 thing floating
around in solution.

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:13.770
And this makes chelates
very stable.

00:13:13.770 --> 00:13:16.720
And so, if you want to get --
if someone is poisoned with

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:19.350
the metal and you want to get
that metal out of your system,

00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:23.150
you give them a chelate such as
EDTA, hospitals have EDTA.

00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:26.410
It's also good, as we learned,
for cleaning bath tubs.

00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:31.370
All right, so that's
the chelate effect.

00:13:31.370 --> 00:13:35.190
All right, so what about zinc.
This enzyme has a zinc and it

00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:38.360
has zinc in the plus
-- zinc plus 2 ion.

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:43.910
So, if you know that, you
can calculate a d count.

00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:47.230
And so again, we can go
to our periodic table.

00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:49.640
What group is zinc in?

00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:50.450
12.

00:13:50.450 --> 00:13:53.570
So what would be the d count?

00:13:53.570 --> 00:13:54.560
10.

00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:58.290
So 12 minus 2 equals 10.

00:13:58.290 --> 00:14:01.520
So what would you think would
be true about the color of

00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:33.810
this d 10 system?

00:14:33.810 --> 00:14:48.710
All right, so let's just
take 10 more seconds.

00:14:48.710 --> 00:14:55.310
All right, so it would
be colorless.

00:14:55.310 --> 00:14:59.700
And so, all of the d orbitals
are going to be full, and so

00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:03.190
there's no transition from one
set of d orbitals to the

00:15:03.190 --> 00:15:07.120
other, and so it would be
a colorless compound.

00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:11.590
And that is, in fact, true that
it took years and years

00:15:11.590 --> 00:15:14.100
of studying methionine synthase
before people

00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:17.150
realized that it had a zinc in
it, no one knew that there was

00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:19.450
a zinc, because they
couldn't see it.

00:15:19.450 --> 00:15:23.330
It didn't add a color, and so
no one knew that a metal was

00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:24.660
there for a long time.

00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:31.750
All right, so what about
oxidation reduction?

00:15:31.750 --> 00:15:34.900
So, this enzyme does
a lot of different

00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:37.440
oxidation reduction reactions.

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:41.280
So, when it reacts with
homocysteine to form

00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:44.960
methionine, and the vitamin
B12, which is shown in a

00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:48.950
cartoon form down here, goes
from a plus 3 state that has

00:15:48.950 --> 00:15:52.360
the methyl associated, it gives
the methyl group, the c

00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:55.900
h 3 group, up to homocysteine
to form methionine, and then

00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:58.750
you're in a plus 1 state
of cobalt here.

00:15:58.750 --> 00:16:03.780
But this state can lose an
electron, and you can have a

00:16:03.780 --> 00:16:06.570
what's called Co(II) form of the
enzyme, which you need to

00:16:06.570 --> 00:16:10.870
put another electron in and
reduce it to go back, and you

00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:12.790
also need to methylate
it again.

00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:16.220
And the methyl group comes from
s adenosylmethionine.

00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:19.320
So, we need to think about how
we're going to reduce the

00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:23.990
vitamin to get it back in its
primary turnover state.

00:16:23.990 --> 00:16:26.910
so, we know the redox
potentials for this.

00:16:26.910 --> 00:16:29.460
The standard reduction
potential for vitamin

00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:30.800
B12 is minus 0 .

00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:32.670
5 2 6 volts.

00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:35.640
The potential reduction
potential for flavodoxin,

00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:38.420
which is the protein that gives
it the 1 electron, and

00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:41.090
it's a flavin protein, which
is another B vitamin.

00:16:41.090 --> 00:16:42.810
And that's minus 0 .

00:16:42.810 --> 00:16:46.290
2 3 0 volts.

00:16:46.290 --> 00:16:49.120
So, what do we know
about these?

00:16:49.120 --> 00:17:34.540
Tell me which is the better
reducing agent.

00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:37.110
All right, let's just
do 10 more seconds.

00:17:37.110 --> 00:17:50.730
Click in your responses.

00:17:50.730 --> 00:17:55.450
OK.

00:17:55.450 --> 00:18:00.860
So, vitamin B12 is a better
reducing agent.

00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:05.610
If you have a large negative
number, then the reduced

00:18:05.610 --> 00:18:08.110
species is very reducing.

00:18:08.110 --> 00:18:11.390
So it wants to reduce
other things and

00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:14.030
get oxidized itself.

00:18:14.030 --> 00:18:16.440
So, that's interesting.

00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:20.120
It seems like vitamin B12 should
be reducing flavodoxin

00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:22.940
and not the other way around.

00:18:22.940 --> 00:18:27.040
So we can look at how
unfavorable this process is,

00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:30.850
and we can calculate a standard
potential for this,

00:18:30.850 --> 00:18:34.040
and we can use this equation
where we have reduction minus

00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:39.080
oxidation and plug the values
in, and so we have a minus 0 .

00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:45.050
5 2 6 minus a minus of the
floating potential, and that

00:18:45.050 --> 00:18:48.050
gives us a negative
value for delta e.

00:18:48.050 --> 00:18:51.750
So is this reaction
spontaneous?

00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:56.640
No, and that's because if you
have a negative standard

00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:58.890
reduction potential, then
you're going to have a

00:18:58.890 --> 00:19:03.280
positive value for delta g, so
it will not be spontaneous.

00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:06.720
And again, you can calculate the
value for delta g, so we

00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:09.330
have minus n, number of moles
of electrons, Faraday's

00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:13.640
constant times the difference
in potential, and it's a one

00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:17.520
electron process, we put in
Faraday's constant and the

00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:21.760
calculated value for delta e,
and we get a positive 28 .

00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:22.730
6.

00:19:22.730 --> 00:19:26.150
And as I mentioned before in
class, the way this reaction

00:19:26.150 --> 00:19:30.010
goes is that at the same time an
electron goes in, you also

00:19:30.010 --> 00:19:33.040
cleave s adenosylmethionine,
which gives the methyl group

00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:36.000
to also return to the catalytic
cycle, and that

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.580
process is very favorable
minus 37 .

00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:41.430
6 kilojoules per mole.

00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:44.650
So it drives the unfavorable
reaction.

00:19:44.650 --> 00:19:48.300
So in the body you will have a
favorable oxidation reductions

00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:53.780
and you'll have unfavorable
ones.

00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:56.680
All right, so what do you a cell
that requires energy to

00:19:56.680 --> 00:20:01.990
catalyze a non-spontaneous
reaction?

00:20:01.990 --> 00:20:03.070
So, that's an electrolitic
cell.

00:20:03.070 --> 00:20:08.170
And a cell that catalyzes
a spontaneous reaction?

00:20:08.170 --> 00:20:10.880
Galvanic, right.

00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:13.100
So again, with oxidation
reduction, it doesn't matter

00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:15.610
if you're talking about a
battery, or if you're talking

00:20:15.610 --> 00:20:20.040
about a cellular process, all
the same equations apply.

00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:26.260
All right, what about acid
based equilibrium.

00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:30.560
So in this particular -- in this
catalytic cycle, we are

00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:34.780
converting homocysteine to
methionine, and that chemistry

00:20:34.780 --> 00:20:38.670
involves acid base.

00:20:38.670 --> 00:20:41.280
So what is true about the
reaction is that the

00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:43.310
protonation state of
the substrate,

00:20:43.310 --> 00:20:45.750
homocysteine, matters.

00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:49.120
So, you can have a protonated
homocysteine, and here's the

00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:51.790
structure of homocysteine, a
deprotonated homocysteine

00:20:51.790 --> 00:20:55.880
where the sulfur does not
have a proton anymore.

00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:57.900
So we have an s minus here.

00:20:57.900 --> 00:21:01.920
And this protonated form of
homocysteine can be converted

00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:05.760
to methionine where there's a
methyl group attached to the

00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:07.970
sulfur here.

00:21:07.970 --> 00:21:12.410
So, we want to know at
physiological p h 7 .

00:21:12.410 --> 00:21:16.620
4, how much of the homocysteine
is deprotonated?

00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:20.510
And here, if you're asking how
much of something is in a

00:21:20.510 --> 00:21:24.610
protonated state, how much of
something is in a deprotonated

00:21:24.610 --> 00:21:30.050
state, what you are asking
is what is the p k a of

00:21:30.050 --> 00:21:32.810
homocysteine.

00:21:32.810 --> 00:21:34.660
So what is the p k a
of homocysteine?

00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:37.870
That's what you need to know to
figure out how much would

00:21:37.870 --> 00:21:40.220
be in the protonated state,
how much would be in the

00:21:40.220 --> 00:21:41.860
deprotonated state.

00:21:41.860 --> 00:21:45.250
So here, the p k a is 10.

00:21:45.250 --> 00:21:48.870
So now, without doing any
calculations, I want you to

00:21:48.870 --> 00:21:53.460
tell me what you expect about
how much is protonated and how

00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:57.070
much is deprotonated at
physiological p h if

00:21:57.070 --> 00:22:36.190
the p k a is 10.

00:22:36.190 --> 00:22:57.480
All right, let's just take
10 more seconds.

00:22:57.480 --> 00:23:00.720
I hope that I mentioned
that acid base will be

00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:02.800
on the final exam.

00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:05.740
So good thing we're reviewing
it right now.

00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:13.850
All right, so now let's
look at the math.

00:23:13.850 --> 00:23:17.630
So if you're given a p k a and p
h and asked about a ratio of

00:23:17.630 --> 00:23:20.620
protonated to deprotonated
it's OK to pull out your

00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:23.820
favorite Henderson Hasselbalch
equation, which gives you a

00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:27.010
sense of the ratio, can predict
the ratio, again it's

00:23:27.010 --> 00:23:29.950
approximation, but predict the
ratio of protonated to

00:23:29.950 --> 00:23:30.070
deprotonated.

00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:34.300
H a, of course, being an
abbreviation for protonated, a

00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:36.440
minus for deprotonated.

00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:40.550
And so we can calculate here
that if you have a p h of 7 .

00:23:40.550 --> 00:23:45.220
4, p k a of 10, you get
a ratio of 400:1.

00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:48.150
So that's the math, but you can
also just think about it

00:23:48.150 --> 00:23:49.540
in terms of what you know.

00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:52.430
So let's just do
a brief review.

00:23:52.430 --> 00:23:54.560
So the answer here is that
free homocysteine is

00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:58.220
protonated and non-reactive
at physiological p h.

00:23:58.220 --> 00:24:00.260
But let's just think about this
question a little more.

00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:02.500
So this is not a figure in
today's handout, but you've

00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:04.710
seen this a few times,
so let's just

00:24:04.710 --> 00:24:06.400
look at it for a minute.

00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:09.140
So, we talked a lot about
acid based titrations.

00:24:09.140 --> 00:24:11.920
We talked about so here we have
a weak acid tritrated

00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:13.070
with a strong base.

00:24:13.070 --> 00:24:15.650
In the beginning it's a weak
acid problem, at the

00:24:15.650 --> 00:24:18.540
equivalence point it's a weak
base problem, because we've

00:24:18.540 --> 00:24:21.650
added enough moles of our strong
acid to convert all of

00:24:21.650 --> 00:24:24.580
our weak acid to its
conjugate base.

00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:27.800
And in the middle when you've
added half the number of the

00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:32.340
moles, you've converted half
of your weak acid to its

00:24:32.340 --> 00:24:34.990
conjugate, then the p
h is equal to the

00:24:34.990 --> 00:24:36.560
p k a at this point.

00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:38.300
So that would be right
in the middle of

00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:39.760
this buffering region.

00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:42.780
Again, in a buffering region
you have quite a bit -- you

00:24:42.780 --> 00:24:45.740
have quite a bit of your weak
acid and quite a bit of a

00:24:45.740 --> 00:24:47.880
conjugate, so it can buffer.

00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:51.630
If strong acid is added, then
it can be used up, if strong

00:24:51.630 --> 00:24:54.000
base is added, it can be used
up without changing

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:55.170
the p h very much.

00:24:55.170 --> 00:24:59.180
That's a buffer, so the p h
curve is flat in here in that

00:24:59.180 --> 00:25:00.520
buffering region.

00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:05.310
And so, when you think about
this, if you're at p h's that

00:25:05.310 --> 00:25:09.580
are below the p k a, then
you're going to be more

00:25:09.580 --> 00:25:14.140
protonated, and p h is above
the p k a, you'll be more

00:25:14.140 --> 00:25:14.290
deprotonated.

00:25:14.290 --> 00:25:18.060
So let's look at the figure now
that's in today's handout

00:25:18.060 --> 00:25:19.440
and think about this.

00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:24.980
So when the p h equals the p k
a, you will have equal number

00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:30.090
of moles, of something that's
protonated as deprotonated.

00:25:30.090 --> 00:25:33.590
And if you're at p h's above
the p k a, you'll be more

00:25:33.590 --> 00:25:34.850
deprotonated.

00:25:34.850 --> 00:25:39.290
P h's below the p k a, you'll
be more protonated.

00:25:39.290 --> 00:25:43.300
And in the particular example
I gave, we have a p k a

00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:45.140
of 10, so at 7 .

00:25:45.140 --> 00:25:50.650
4 we're at a p h that is below
the p k a, and so here they'd

00:25:50.650 --> 00:25:52.200
be more protonated.

00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:54.600
So if you do the math
it's 400:1.

00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:57.810
But even if you aren't doing
any math, you should think

00:25:57.810 --> 00:26:01.950
about the fact that that would
have more of the protonated

00:26:01.950 --> 00:26:05.130
form than the deprotonated
form.

00:26:05.130 --> 00:26:09.160
All right, but the enzyme has
a problem, because only the

00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:11.630
deprotonated form is active.

00:26:11.630 --> 00:26:15.320
The p k a of the free
homocysteine is 10, and you're

00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:18.630
at physiological p h, so this
reaction doesn't seem

00:26:18.630 --> 00:26:19.980
like it should go.

00:26:19.980 --> 00:26:23.310
But again, it's an enzyme, and
enzymes catalyze reactions.

00:26:23.310 --> 00:26:26.630
So they do things to make
that reaction go faster.

00:26:26.630 --> 00:26:30.800
And what this particular enzyme
does is it lowers the p

00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:33.390
k a of homocysteine.

00:26:33.390 --> 00:26:37.110
So when homocysteine is bound
to the enzyme, it's p k a is

00:26:37.110 --> 00:26:42.460
no longer 10, but now
its p k a is 6.

00:26:42.460 --> 00:26:44.080
So, how does the
enzyme do this?

00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:46.590
Well, that's where the
zinc comes in.

00:26:46.590 --> 00:26:50.100
So, the zinc binds to the
homocysteine and it acts as a

00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:54.350
Lewis acid as it binds
to the homocysteine.

00:26:54.350 --> 00:26:56.620
So the homocysteine is your
donor ligand, and you have

00:26:56.620 --> 00:26:59.450
your metal as the Lewis
acid, your acceptor.

00:26:59.450 --> 00:27:05.290
And that alters the p k a, so
it actually associates, zinc

00:27:05.290 --> 00:27:09.580
associates with this sulfur,
and that changes the p k a.

00:27:09.580 --> 00:27:13.280
So, I just wanted to mention
again, I was having dinner

00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:16.390
with some of my faculty
colleagues who teach organic

00:27:16.390 --> 00:27:17.400
chemistry here.

00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:21.040
We were interviewing another job
candidate, and they looked

00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:23.290
at me and said, they're teaching
organic this semester

00:27:23.290 --> 00:27:25.950
and they said we asked our class
about p k a's, and they

00:27:25.950 --> 00:27:29.215
all insisted that they had never
heard about p k a's in

00:27:29.215 --> 00:27:30.740
their freshman chemistry
course.

00:27:30.740 --> 00:27:35.280
And I, of course, said, well,
they did not take 511-1 then.

00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:39.440
So just remember, especially
when it's Barbara Imperiali

00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:43.870
asking, did you hear about
p k a's, the answer is?

00:27:43.870 --> 00:27:45.130
STUDENT: Yes.

00:27:45.130 --> 00:27:46.450
PROFESSOR: Thank you.

00:27:46.450 --> 00:27:50.740
OK, so just this week.

00:27:50.740 --> 00:27:55.740
So it alters the p k a here.

00:27:55.740 --> 00:27:57.550
So now what's our situation?

00:27:57.550 --> 00:28:02.890
Well, now at physiological p h,
we have a p k a of 6, and

00:28:02.890 --> 00:28:05.230
so that gives us a very
different ratio.

00:28:05.230 --> 00:28:08.790
Instead of 400:1,
we have 1:25.

00:28:08.790 --> 00:28:13.560
So most of the homocysteine is
deprotonated at physiological

00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:17.110
p h, which means that
it can react.

00:28:17.110 --> 00:28:22.410
So, if we go back to this now,
our p k a is now 6, and so

00:28:22.410 --> 00:28:26.860
physiological p h is now
above that p k a.

00:28:26.860 --> 00:28:30.420
So when you're above the p
k a, you should have more

00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:32.460
deprotonated than protonated.

00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:37.700
So that's how you can
rationalize these things.

00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:41.340
All right, now I have to ask,
all right, we do not need a

00:28:41.340 --> 00:28:42.620
tie breaker.

00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:46.610
So at the end of the lecture,
we will announce the winner.

00:28:46.610 --> 00:28:51.000
But let's first do chemical
equilibrium.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:54.510
Chemical equilibrium.

00:28:54.510 --> 00:28:57.540
So we didn't talk too much
about this in chemical

00:28:57.540 --> 00:29:01.170
equilibrium, but enzymes can
have alternate conformation,

00:29:01.170 --> 00:29:05.150
so the enzyme can change its
shape during chemistry.

00:29:05.150 --> 00:29:08.740
And that those conformation
of the enzyme can be in

00:29:08.740 --> 00:29:09.760
equilibrium.

00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:13.220
So the enzyme itself can be an
equilibrium with different

00:29:13.220 --> 00:29:16.960
conformational states.

00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:19.240
So here, there are a lot of
states of the enzyme.

00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:20.870
It needs to react with
homocysteine, it needs to

00:29:20.870 --> 00:29:22.760
react with
methyltetrahydrofolate and

00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:23.610
with s adenosylmethionine.

00:29:23.610 --> 00:29:30.360
And when the structure was
determined to this enzyme,

00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:33.360
here in green is the vitamin
B12, and red

00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:34.790
is the methyl group.

00:29:34.790 --> 00:29:36.980
You see that the methyl group
is pretty buried, you can

00:29:36.980 --> 00:29:39.970
barely see it, but yet it
needs to interact with

00:29:39.970 --> 00:29:42.790
homocysteine to give it a methyl
group, it needs to take

00:29:42.790 --> 00:29:45.470
a methyl group off
methyltetrahydrofolate, it

00:29:45.470 --> 00:29:47.370
also needs to take a
methyl group off s

00:29:47.370 --> 00:29:48.730
adenosylmethionine.

00:29:48.730 --> 00:29:50.780
But it doesn't seem like there's
any room for any of

00:29:50.780 --> 00:29:52.740
them to actually get in there.

00:29:52.740 --> 00:29:56.080
So, this was a sign that there
has to be some kind of change

00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:57.360
in the structure.

00:29:57.360 --> 00:29:59.680
So here's another picture
of the structure.

00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:02.090
Here's the vitamin B12 in green,
the methyl group in

00:30:02.090 --> 00:30:05.400
red, and there's this whole
protein part up here that has

00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:08.350
to get out of the way
to do the chemistry.

00:30:08.350 --> 00:30:11.550
And, in fact, we do know from
experimental data that it does

00:30:11.550 --> 00:30:14.720
move so you can do
the chemistry.

00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:17.780
So that means that the enzyme
has to have a number of

00:30:17.780 --> 00:30:19.130
different structures.

00:30:19.130 --> 00:30:20.720
It's modular.

00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:23.950
Here's the vitamin B12 binding
domain, the vitamin B12,

00:30:23.950 --> 00:30:27.130
there's this region that have to
move called the methyl cap.

00:30:27.130 --> 00:30:30.060
It needs to interact, the B12
here needs to interact with a

00:30:30.060 --> 00:30:32.680
folate domain, a homocysteine
domain, and

00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:35.530
an activation domain.

00:30:35.530 --> 00:30:39.250
So you need to have at least
these four different

00:30:39.250 --> 00:30:42.490
structures, and these four
structures will be in

00:30:42.490 --> 00:30:45.010
equilibrium with each other.

00:30:45.010 --> 00:30:47.680
So you need to have a structure
with folate, a

00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:51.340
binding domain on top of the
red B12, you need to have

00:30:51.340 --> 00:30:55.050
homocysteine in yellow on top of
the B12, you need to have a

00:30:55.050 --> 00:30:58.530
resting state where those
helices are on top of the B12,

00:30:58.530 --> 00:31:00.660
and you need to have an
activation state where the

00:31:00.660 --> 00:31:04.450
ado-meth domain is on top of
the B12, and all of these

00:31:04.450 --> 00:31:07.810
states are going to be in
equilibrium with each other,

00:31:07.810 --> 00:31:10.100
and they're going to be moving,
which means that

00:31:10.100 --> 00:31:12.880
enzymes are dynamic,
which means that

00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:15.960
chemistry is dynamic.

00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:19.580
Chemistry in the body is
not in the solid state.

00:31:19.580 --> 00:31:24.170
Chemistry in the body
is in solution.

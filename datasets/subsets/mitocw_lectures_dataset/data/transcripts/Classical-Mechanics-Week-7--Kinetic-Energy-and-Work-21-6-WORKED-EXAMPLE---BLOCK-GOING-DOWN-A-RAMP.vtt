00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:06.770
Let's apply the work
energy theorem principle

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:10.685
to the motion of a block
sliding down an inclined plane.

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:16.415
And here is an inclined
plane at an angle, theta.

00:00:16.415 --> 00:00:17.915
And lets choose a
coordinate system.

00:00:17.915 --> 00:00:22.520
We'll choose x equals 0
up here, or i-hat here.

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.270
And here is our
coordinate function.

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:30.745
And suppose that the
object starts at xi,

00:00:30.745 --> 00:00:35.120
that it ends at x final.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.730
If we want to calculate
the work energy then

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.550
what we're going to learn
is that this theorem

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:45.710
is two different sides.

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:47.870
Calculating the change
in kinetic energy

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:49.520
is simply a description.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:55.700
This is 1/2 M v final squared
minus 1/2 v initial squared.

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.970
That's a property,
parameters of the system,

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:03.410
at the initial state, the
speed, or the velocity's speed,

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:06.870
which is speed squared.

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:12.080
And the same property v
final in the final state.

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.650
Now over here we have
two types of forces

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:16.670
acting on this object.

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:24.170
So here we need a free-body
force diagram first.

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:30.080
And this side is where the
physics [INAUDIBLE] lie.

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.850
And so we want to draw
our force diagram.

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.160
So if we have our block,
we have the friction force,

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.220
we have the normal
force, we have mg.

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.450
Recall, if the plane
is inclined theta

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.610
that's also the angle theta.

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.160
If we chose i-hat,
j-hat unit vectors,

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.160
I just want to repeat that
on my free-body diagram.

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.440
Now we can think of
this integral as just

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.660
one-dimensional motion
in the x direction.

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.680
And so we have two
different forces

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.060
that we have to calculate.

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.760
The friction force is
in the minus x direction

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.180
so we're integrating minus the
friction force with respect

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.290
to displacement from
x initial to x final.

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.940
And what about the
gravitational force?

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.470
Well the gravitational force
has a component, mg sine

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.270
theta in the x direction.

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.870
So when we integrate
that x component

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.750
we have now plus because
it's in the same direction.

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.280
Remember, we're displacing a
little bit dx down the inclined

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.930
plane so we're going from x
initial x final of mg sine

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.090
theta, which is a constant, dx.

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.700
And so when you're applying
the work energy theorem

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.250
you need to
integrate your forces

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.740
and actually calculate the work.

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:55.829
Now again, if you looked
in the j-hat direction,

00:02:55.829 --> 00:03:00.770
and we applied Newton's second
law, n minus mg cosine theta 0,

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:03.980
and our rule for friction
is its mu k times

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.660
n or mu k mg cosine
theta, then what

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.200
we have is in both instances
we have a constant force.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.240
So it's just force
times displacement.

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:20.520
So we have minus mu k mg cosine
theta times the displacement,

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.910
which is x initial x final.

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:30.800
Over here we have mg sine theta
times x final minus x initial.

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:34.220
And now we've calculated
separately both sides

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.310
of our work kinetic
energy principle.

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:39.500
As in all our physical
laws the equal sign

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.800
means the work is equal to
the change in kinetic energy.

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:47.090
I'll emphasize that by now
placing the equal sign because

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:48.530
of our physical law.

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:54.350
And so equaling 1/2 M v final
squared minus v initial mean

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:55.220
squared.

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:58.760
And now I have a relationship
between the parameters

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.360
of the initial state, which
I'm calling x initial and v

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.280
initial, and the parameters
that describe the final state, x

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:07.690
final, v final.

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:10.370
And depending on which set
of these parameters are given

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:13.550
I can conceivably solve
for the other ones.

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:15.200
One thing I do want
to point out when

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.950
we do this example is
we've described work

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:24.740
as a dot product from A to
B. Take the friction force.

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.860
Well in this instance, if
we wrote this out explicitly

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:34.130
it would be minus fk i-hat
dot dx i-hat from the initial

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:35.390
to the final.

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:37.760
i-had dot i-hat is 1.

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:44.180
And so you see, we recover from
x initial to x final of fk dx.

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:46.950
And that was the first piece.

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:49.909
The second piece, the
gravitational force,

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:53.510
dotted into ds from
x initial to x final.

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:58.610
Well, if you wrote down the
gravitational force, mg,

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:04.910
as a i-hat component
and a negative mg cosine

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:11.510
theta j-hat component, then when
we take the dot product again

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:19.160
where our ds-- here, we'll
write ds as dx i-hat--

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:24.500
then when you dot product
mg dot ds, mg dot ds,

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:27.230
we have i-hat dot
i-hat, which is one.

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:30.890
But j-hat dot i-hat, they're
perpendicular so that's 0,

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:34.565
so the only piece that survives
in the scalar product mg

00:05:34.565 --> 00:05:37.860
dot ds is these two pieces.

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:40.250
And so we get the integral
from x initial to x

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:45.320
final of mg sine theta times dx.

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:49.440
And that's precisely
our second piece here.

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:54.100
So here's the simple application
of the work energy theorem.

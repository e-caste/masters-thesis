00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:14.830
PROFESSOR: Welcome back to 820.

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:20.650
So in this section, we want
to define events and frames.

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:24.080
The goal is to define the
principle of relativity.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.280
So let's think first about
what an event actually is.

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:29.740
An event is something
that happens,

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:33.760
and it happens independently
of the frame of reference,

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:38.440
independently in how we want
to describe the event itself.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.390
We might use the frame,
the reference frame,

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:41.710
to define the event.

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.410
But again, the event
is an independent thing

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.510
which happens.

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.120
Let's look at an
example, probably

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.020
one of my favorite
example in this class.

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.310
Guess what happens?

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:54.150
What?

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.510
Professor Kloots exploded.

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:58.320
Really?

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.790
And then you start asking the
questions, when and where.

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:04.810
When did it happen, and
where did it happen?

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:07.560
But the event happens
without a description

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.840
of the when and where.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.420
We can then draw
a reference frame,

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.840
as I did here, with an
origin, with an x-coordinate,

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.200
and a y-coordinate,
and z-coordinate.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:27.530
And in this picture, we have
a spot defined for the event.

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.860
And we need to also have a
fourth coordinate for this,

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.280
the time, in order to describe
when the event actually

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:35.160
happened.

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.780
And I did this here.

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.370
And some coordinates I give you.

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:43.000
It's 42 degrees north,
75 degrees west,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.900
Cambridge, Massachusetts at MIT.

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.340
You see, MIT, the dome
behind me, at 3:30

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.430
PM on January 6, 2021.

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:56.240
So I give you the when and
the where for this event.

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.360
I didn't give you the
altitude, for example.

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.030
This is, in this picture,
maybe the y-coordinate

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:02.770
or the z-coordinate.

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.360
But that would be
needed as well.

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.320
I just tell you, maybe it's
my office on the fourth floor

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:11.680
in building 24.

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.660
So when we want to consider
an event describing the event,

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.200
we have to consider the
space, so where, and the time,

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.190
the when.

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.460
And we can do this as a
four dimensional vector

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:27.010
or a four vector data set.

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.760
And so our event,
Professor Kloots exploded,

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.950
can be described
with this vector

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:38.190
P, which has an x-coordinate,
a y-coordinate, a z-coordinate,

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.020
and a time coordinate.

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:45.110
So the important part here is
that events happen independent

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:47.540
on the frame of reference.

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.820
If you are sitting in your room
somewhere in Europe right now,

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:57.500
you can describe this
event with your time frame.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.140
There's a six hour
time difference.

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:04.340
So this 3:30 PM would be
9:30 PM in the evening.

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.810
You can define your
little room as the origin

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.780
and then draw an x-coordinate
and a y-coordinate

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.810
and z-coordinate that
describes this specific event.

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:16.550
This description
will look different

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:18.690
from the description
I just gave you.

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.170
But the event is unchanged.

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:25.060
It's independent of the
choice of reference.

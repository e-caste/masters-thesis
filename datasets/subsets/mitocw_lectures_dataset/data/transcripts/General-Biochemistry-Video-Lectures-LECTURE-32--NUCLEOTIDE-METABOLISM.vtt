[CLICKING]

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:12.940
PROFESSOR: Today
I want to discuss

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:14.590
nucleic acid metabolism.

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:16.090
But before getting
to that, I want

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:19.300
to take a step
back and talk a bit

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:24.100
about what we closed with last
time, which was discussing

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.140
serine, glycine
metabolism and how

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.680
they can be used to generate
one-carbon units that

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.050
are for one-carbon
transfer reactions.

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:35.260
And these are one-carbon
transfer reactions

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.665
moving carbon that's
more reduced than CO2.

00:00:38.665 --> 00:00:41.290
You'll remember, if we're going
to do a carboxylation reaction,

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:44.830
transfer of CO2, that
often uses biotin,

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:47.530
whereas if you're transferring
a one-carbon unit that's

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.310
more reduced than CO2, it comes
from these folate species.

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:54.040
And we described some of the
different folate species--

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.420
N5-methyl-THF, which can
donate a fully reduced

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.060
one-carbon unit, a
methyl group, to SAM,

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:02.980
SAM being the
universal methyl donor

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:05.830
for most methylation
reactions in cells.

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.410
You can also have folates carry
more oxidized one-carbon units,

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:13.120
N5, N10-methylene-THF
and N10-formyl-THF.

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.130
And those will be
very important today

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.580
as we discuss one-carbon
transfer reactions

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.280
and nucleotide synthesis.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.710
Now, I recognize that
folate metabolism

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.050
can be very confusing.

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:27.790
The structures are complex.

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:31.480
The names are long and
convoluted and hard

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.420
to incorporate.

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.750
But if you can think of
it as just transferring

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.870
one-carbon units of a
different oxidation state,

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:43.390
hopefully that will help
you better understand what's

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.460
going on in folate reactions.

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.670
And so really, all it
is, remember, serine

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.230
has three carbons.

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:52.460
Glycine has two carbons.

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.360
And so when you convert
serine to glycine,

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.850
you end up generating
a one-carbon unit.

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.830
As I showed you in
the lecture last time,

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:06.040
this one-carbon unit is in the
formaldehyde oxidation state.

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.530
And so ultimately,
that's generated.

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.990
That's donated to
a folate species

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:22.760
to generate this carrier,
the N5, N10-methylene-THF,

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:30.770
which you can really think of as
a carrier for one-carbon units

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:33.890
in the formaldehyde
oxidation state.

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:39.440
Now, those can undergo
an oxidation reaction.

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:46.010
And so if we oxidize that carbon
from the aldehyde to the acid,

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.815
now we end up getting
the N10-formyl-THF.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.640
All right, so that's
carrying the one-carbon unit

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.730
as the acid.

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:09.570
Or we can reduce that one-carbon
unit to the methyl group.

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:17.490
And that's carrying it
as the N5-methyl-THF,

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:23.850
so carrying this as a methyl
group, more reduced carbon

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:25.170
than where we started.

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.140
And so try to cut through
all the names and whatnot

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.220
and just realize that it's
simply transfers of carbon

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:33.960
in different oxidation states.

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:35.760
And the relevant
ones today is going

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.810
to be N10-formyl and N5,
N10-methylene-THF because it

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.960
turns out generating
those oxidized

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:46.050
one-carbon units, formate
groups, et cetera,

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:50.040
is going to be important
for purine as well

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.170
as thymine synthesis.

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:59.130
OK, so our topic today
is really to discuss

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:02.280
how we generate
nucleic acids, how

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:07.110
we break down purines and
pyrimidines or purines.

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:11.550
And this is really the final
topic here in the course.

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:16.950
In some ways, it's a bit fitting
because it really incorporates

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:21.930
lots of aspects of metabolism
that we've been discussing

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.930
over the course of the
semester, all come together

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.640
in nucleotide metabolism.

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:32.850
Now, nucleotide metabolism
itself is a very large topic,

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:37.680
probably deserves more
than one 90 minute lecture.

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.110
But unfortunately, the
time is what it is.

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:43.410
And we just don't have time
to cover every single detail.

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:46.620
However, we can go
pretty fast and at least

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.110
give you a flavor
of what's going on

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:53.130
because as I've alluded to, this
draws to lots of metabolism.

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:56.130
I drew here just a
very skeletonized view

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:59.770
of glycolysis, the TCA cycle,
the pentose phosphate pathway,

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:03.810
couple aspects of amino acid
synthesis, folate metabolism,

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:06.330
and drew boxes around
all the precursors

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:09.150
that are necessary to
generate various nucleotides.

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:10.770
And you can see
it's really drawn

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:14.010
from across these
metabolic pathways.

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:16.080
As we go through
these, you'll see

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.240
that you actually know a lot.

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.610
And this synthesizes,
really, what

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:23.610
we've learned from lots of
other pathways coming together

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:29.940
into understanding how cells
make purines and pyrimidines.

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:34.630
Now down here, I've color
coded all the different--

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:35.610
so here's a pyrimidine.

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:38.640
Here's a purine,
the ring structure

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:41.520
that you're probably familiar
with from these purines

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.950
and pyrimidines--
and color coded where

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:46.770
it is that each of these
atoms come from, where they're

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:53.820
drawn from across metabolism.

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:56.160
And again, it's a
nice way to sort

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.530
of synthesize lots
of the pathways

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:01.140
that we've discussed in class.

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:05.700
Now ribose also is going to
come from ribose 5-phosphate.

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:08.730
That's, of course, a product of
the pentose phosphate pathway,

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:11.880
oxidative or non-oxidative,
depending on how the cell wants

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:13.420
to use those pathways--

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:15.420
the Calvin cycle
and photosynthesis,

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:18.270
lots of ways to get
ribose 5-phosphate.

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:20.220
That generates the ribose.

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:22.890
And then there's a
lot of complexity

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:28.840
that goes into how one builds
these complex base structures.

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:33.720
Now, we just want to start here
and show you on the slide here,

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:37.350
here's a general purine base.

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:40.080
Here's a general
pyrimidine base.

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:44.220
Kind of a stupid mnemonic
that's always helped me

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:47.430
that maybe will help you if
you need to remember which

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:50.160
of these is the purine and
which of these is the pyrimidine

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:55.150
as you go through, take MCAT
exams or something like that--

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:58.890
so the purine ring looks
kind of like a pope hat.

00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:00.480
And the pope is pure.

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:02.310
And so it's kind
of stupid, but it's

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:05.730
one way to remember that this
pope hat-looking structure is

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:06.660
the purine.

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:10.620
And the other one
is the pyrimidine.

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:13.560
Of course, you're familiar
with purines and pyrimidines

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:16.500
because these generate
the various bases that

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:19.470
are used for RNA and DNA, so
adenine and guanine, the two

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:22.980
purine bases in RNA
and DNA, and then

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:26.400
cytosine and uracil in RNA,
and cytosine and thymine

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:33.885
in DNA are the pyrimidine
bases in RNA and DNA.

00:07:33.885 --> 00:07:37.478
Now, these are, of course,
not the only possible purines

00:07:37.478 --> 00:07:38.145
and pyrimidines.

00:07:38.145 --> 00:07:40.080
They're not the only
purines and pyrimidines

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:42.230
that nature cares about.

00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:45.400
Here's a few other
ones shown here.

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:48.630
And so here is uric acid.

00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:52.680
Uric acid, as we've
discussed, is the way birds

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:55.200
excrete nitrogen. We'll
discuss later today

00:07:55.200 --> 00:08:00.330
that it's the cause of gout,
a very common human condition.

00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:04.250
There's also lots of other
pharmacologically active

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:06.450
molecules among the
purines and pyrimidines.

00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:10.940
So here's caffeine, certainly
a very important molecule

00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:15.110
for many of us to get
going in the morning.

00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:17.750
There's things like adenine.

00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:21.830
So adenine plus the ribose sugar
is a molecule called adenosine.

00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:24.410
Adenosine is a very
important signaling molecule

00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:25.350
in our bodies.

00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:27.710
If you go to medical
school, you'll

00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:32.690
use adenosine to figure
out people's heart rhythms.

00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:34.471
There's also lots
of drugs that come

00:08:34.471 --> 00:08:35.679
from purines and pyrimidines.

00:08:35.679 --> 00:08:36.990
So here's an example here.

00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:41.870
This is the drug 5-fluorouracil,
a widely used cancer drug.

00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:44.870
And so it's an analog
of a pyrimidine.

00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:49.610
Lots of anti-cancer drugs
as well as antimicrobials

00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:53.270
end up being drugs
that interfere

00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:57.800
with nucleotide metabolism
and often are analogs

00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:00.920
of purines and pyrimidines.

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:03.560
Now the first general
comment I want to make

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:06.620
is that in cells, the
free bases of these things

00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:10.250
are much less useful
than the nucleosides

00:09:10.250 --> 00:09:11.750
and the nucleotides.

00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:15.530
And so just to remind you of
a little bit of nomenclature

00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:19.970
is that these purine and
pyrimidine bases are usually

00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:25.480
attached to ribose
and a nucleoside.

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:30.560
So a nucleoside is basically
the base, purine and pyrimidine

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:33.440
base, plus ribose,
but no phosphate.

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:36.740
All right, so adenosine
would be adenine stuck

00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:38.720
to ribose, but no
phosphates on it.

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:40.040
That's adenosine.

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:43.730
And then you have
your nucleotides.

00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:51.600
And the nucleotides are the base
plus the ribose plus phosphate.

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:55.100
And so it can be nucleotide
monophosphate, diphosphate,

00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:58.790
triphosphate, AMP, ADP, ATP--

00:09:58.790 --> 00:10:02.190
examples of nucleotides.

00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:09.710
Now, there are two major ways
that cells build nucleotides.

00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:15.890
And that is they can
make them de novo.

00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:20.420
So de novo is building
them from scratch.

00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:27.890
Or you'll see that they can
so-called salvage the bases.

00:10:27.890 --> 00:10:30.950
And this is, you might
imagine, that if as animals, we

00:10:30.950 --> 00:10:32.000
eat other organisms.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.980
We take in their RNA and DNA.

00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:37.670
We get some of these
purine and pyrimidine bases

00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:41.090
that these can be salvaged--
that is, added back

00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:46.340
to ribose to generate
nucleosides and nucleotides.

00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:49.880
And you'll see, as we go through
how you do de novo synthesis,

00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:51.980
that making these
things is complex.

00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:54.540
It's energetically expensive.

00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:58.160
And so, of course,
salvaging prevents

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:02.000
you having to expend this
energy and effort in order

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.400
to generate them de novo.

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:06.140
I also want to remind
you because it's

00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:09.320
evident in the fact that
uric acid is a way that birds

00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:12.920
and reptiles can excrete
nitrogen is that just back

00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:17.480
to our prior discussion, that
in the world, in the biosphere,

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:21.050
nitrogen is a
precious commodity.

00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:22.280
Remember, it has to be fixed.

00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:24.560
It's not infinitely available.

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:29.210
Relatively few organisms can fix
nitrogen into its useable form.

00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:34.820
And so salvaging premade
bases is salvaging

00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:36.710
nitrogen in a usable form.

00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:39.300
And so evolutionarily,
for a lot of organisms,

00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:42.500
that's also a
beneficial thing to do.

00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:48.840
All right, now another last
sort of introductory comment

00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:52.920
about why this lecture ends
up being important and having

00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:55.260
some appreciation
of these pathways

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.720
is that certainly if you
go to medical school,

00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:00.720
you will come across
all kinds of things

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:04.260
having to do with the
metabolism of today's lecture.

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:07.560
And that's because it turns
out that making nucleosides

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:10.110
and making nucleotides
is limiting

00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:13.920
for proliferation in all
kinds of biological contexts.

00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:16.140
And this is really back to
what I alluded to earlier.

00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:18.480
A lot of our anti-cancer
drugs, they also

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:20.010
end up being anti-inflammatory.

00:12:20.010 --> 00:12:24.540
So things to treat inflammatory
diseases and cancer oftentimes

00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:29.580
are things that block steps
in nucleotide metabolism.

00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:32.910
Lots of antimicrobials
or antibiotics

00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:36.330
also attack some of
the same pathways,

00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:38.700
but are more specific
for bacterial rather than

00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:40.740
human enzymes.

00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:45.750
And so really, these
drugs converge on pathways

00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:48.840
that either produce or
salvage nucleotides.

00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:52.770
And it's good to have
some appreciation of where

00:12:52.770 --> 00:12:56.280
these things are acting
because this ends up

00:12:56.280 --> 00:13:00.210
being really important
for all kinds of aspects

00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:03.090
of human medicine, as
well as understanding

00:13:03.090 --> 00:13:05.790
other bits of biology.

00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:11.160
All right, now either
de novo synthesis

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:14.820
of purine and
pyrimidine nucleotides

00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:18.960
or salvage of those things,
of purine and pyrimidine

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:23.670
nucleotides, needs to add
the base somehow to a ribose.

00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:29.100
And that starts with generating
a molecule called PRPP,

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:32.650
also abbreviated up there
in my general overview.

00:13:32.650 --> 00:13:34.714
This stands for polyribo--

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:58.000
sorry, stands for phosphoribose
pyrophosphate, PRPP,

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.790
phosphoribose pyrophosphate.

00:14:00.790 --> 00:14:02.020
So what is that?

00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:12.340
Well, this is, if we draw here
our ribose sugar and we draw it

00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:18.070
in the alpha-furanose
form, so this would be

00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:24.700
alpha-5-ribose-phosphate so--

00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:31.000
sorry, alpha-ribose 5-phosphate.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.380
OK, so that's
ribose 5-phosphate.

00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:37.980
That's generated from pentose
phosphate pathway, generated

00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:41.140
from the Calvin cycle, whatever.

00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:45.240
This is really
starting point, discuss

00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:47.910
lots of ways we
can generate that

00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:49.740
through different pathways.

00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:56.670
Well, if we take ATP
and convert it to AMP--

00:14:56.670 --> 00:14:58.570
that is, transfer
two phosphates,

00:14:58.570 --> 00:15:01.830
pyrophosphorylate
the one position--

00:15:01.830 --> 00:15:04.620
now we end up with
this molecule.

00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:19.650
OK, so this molecule
here would be PRPP,

00:15:19.650 --> 00:15:22.860
so phosphoribose pyrophosphate.

00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:32.080
And PRPP can pick up a
nitrogen, either the nitrogen

00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:35.830
from the base if it's
the salvage pathway

00:15:35.830 --> 00:15:39.160
or whatever
nitrogen-containing molecule

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:41.770
is going to be the first step
in de novo synthesis, which

00:15:41.770 --> 00:15:45.250
we'll get to later,
and basically releases

00:15:45.250 --> 00:15:50.440
the pyrophosphate.

00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:54.430
That can be cleaved to
two inorganic phosphates,

00:15:54.430 --> 00:15:56.230
pull the reaction forward.

00:15:56.230 --> 00:16:12.690
And what one ends up with
is basically this nitrogen

00:16:12.690 --> 00:16:21.040
added either as the nucleoside
monophosphate or some precursor

00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:25.030
to nitrogen-containing precursor
to the nucleoside monophosphate

00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:27.970
that we can then build the
purine or pyrimidine base

00:16:27.970 --> 00:16:30.410
on top.

00:16:30.410 --> 00:16:37.060
And so the dogma is that de
novo synthesis of nucleotides

00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:40.360
is important for new
proliferation of cells

00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:43.460
or a salvage is important
for maintenance of cells.

00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:45.410
This is a huge
oversimplification.

00:16:45.410 --> 00:16:49.390
It's effectively untrue
as far as I'm concerned.

00:16:49.390 --> 00:16:51.910
Lots of drugs that
affect salvage

00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:55.720
can affect diseases involved
in proliferation and whatnot.

00:16:55.720 --> 00:17:00.370
But nonetheless, you should
just realize that these early

00:17:00.370 --> 00:17:02.890
steps-- that is, adding PRPP--

00:17:02.890 --> 00:17:05.170
is important either
to salvage things

00:17:05.170 --> 00:17:07.960
or to do de novo synthesis.

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:12.550
Now today, given our
limited amount of time,

00:17:12.550 --> 00:17:16.113
I'm really going to focus on
de novo synthesis of purines

00:17:16.113 --> 00:17:16.780
and pyrimidines.

00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:21.490
I will discuss a little bit
about purine catabolism.

00:17:21.490 --> 00:17:25.000
Mainly this is because these are
the most topics where there's

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.609
something to say about
biochemistry and metabolism

00:17:27.609 --> 00:17:29.800
that builds off a
lot of the themes

00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:31.720
that we've covered in the class.

00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:35.737
They also focus on lots of
aspects of relevant medicine.

00:17:35.737 --> 00:17:37.570
And so those of you who
go to medical school

00:17:37.570 --> 00:17:38.470
will see this again.

00:17:38.470 --> 00:17:42.250
And I want you to
appreciate it a little bit.

00:17:42.250 --> 00:17:44.920
And particularly, some
aspects of salvage

00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:47.500
are important in
biology and medicine.

00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:50.410
But really, my goal
today is not for you

00:17:50.410 --> 00:17:56.750
to understand absolutely every
chemical step that goes on,

00:17:56.750 --> 00:18:00.310
but really to appreciate
how these things happen

00:18:00.310 --> 00:18:02.200
and hopefully
synthesize some of what

00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:05.170
you've learned over the
course of the semester.

00:18:05.170 --> 00:18:10.780
All right, so let's talk first
about how you make purines,

00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:12.310
purine synthesis.

00:18:12.310 --> 00:18:16.750
So purine synthesis, you
should know your MIT history.

00:18:16.750 --> 00:18:19.990
So the purine synthesis
pathway, the de novo--

00:18:19.990 --> 00:18:22.330
that is building
purines from scratch--

00:18:22.330 --> 00:18:26.110
was largely worked out by a guy
by the name of Jack Buchanan.

00:18:26.110 --> 00:18:29.500
He partially did this at MIT.

00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:33.760
He basically was recruited
from elsewhere, came to MIT.

00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:36.790
And when he was at MIT,
also was the person

00:18:36.790 --> 00:18:39.790
who really modernized the
MIT biology department

00:18:39.790 --> 00:18:42.200
to be what it is today.

00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:45.190
So prior to Jack Buchanan,
biology department

00:18:45.190 --> 00:18:50.140
was much more about ecology
and things like that.

00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:54.460
And really, he moved the
MIT biology department

00:18:54.460 --> 00:18:57.770
into the molecular era.

00:18:57.770 --> 00:19:03.470
And so for the MIT
students, it's good for you

00:19:03.470 --> 00:19:06.800
to appreciate some
of our history.

00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:10.730
All right, now
purine synthesis--

00:19:10.730 --> 00:19:13.160
as I said, I'm going
to go through all

00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:14.840
the steps of purine synthesis.

00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:17.990
You'll see it's
complicated, all right?

00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:19.940
I will show you some
of the chemistry.

00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:21.890
I don't have time to
go into great detail

00:19:21.890 --> 00:19:24.170
or explain all of the
steps in great detail.

00:19:24.170 --> 00:19:25.700
But again, my goal
here is for you

00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:27.920
to appreciate how
purines are made,

00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:33.380
not necessarily memorize all
the steps in the pathway.

00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:37.250
All right, so purine
synthesis starts

00:19:37.250 --> 00:19:43.590
with phosphoribose
pyrophosphate, OK?

00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:48.030
We're going to build
on the ribose base.

00:19:48.030 --> 00:19:54.750
And the first step
is taking glutamine

00:19:54.750 --> 00:19:56.700
and converting it to glutamate.

00:19:56.700 --> 00:19:58.710
So what is that transferring?

00:19:58.710 --> 00:20:05.765
That's transferring a nitrogen.

00:20:05.765 --> 00:20:08.140
Remember, the difference
between glutamine and glutamate,

00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:10.015
you can pick that up
with glutamine synthase,

00:20:10.015 --> 00:20:15.340
is that was one way to put an
ammonia onto glutamate to make

00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:16.300
glutamine.

00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:19.420
And so this ends up
carrying out the reaction

00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:29.980
that I showed you
earlier and adds

00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:37.270
a nitrogen to the ribose sugar,
giving you this compound.

00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:43.930
All right, the next step is
to take a glycine molecule.

00:20:43.930 --> 00:20:48.445
And that glycine molecule
gets phosphorylated with ATP.

00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:08.370
So phosphorylate the carboxylic
acid on the glycine molecule,

00:21:08.370 --> 00:21:26.710
and then this will combine
with the prior molecule,

00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:31.900
releasing phosphate and
generating this molecule, which

00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:37.720
I'm now going to just draw
phosphoribose as like that

00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:41.425
because drawing ribose over and
over again will become painful.

00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:02.640
And that generates
this intermediate,

00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:12.204
which is called
glycinamide ribonucleotide.

00:22:15.650 --> 00:22:17.660
I'm not going to
write out nucleotide.

00:22:17.660 --> 00:22:22.130
And you will see that many of
the steps in purine synthesis

00:22:22.130 --> 00:22:24.870
end up having these
abbreviations.

00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:28.850
This one is called GAR for
glycinamide ribonucleotide.

00:22:28.850 --> 00:22:31.400
And you'll see, as we get
these long complex names,

00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:36.020
why one uses these abbreviations
like GAR, which are actually

00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:39.740
used quite commonly.

00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:42.020
All right, the
next step is we're

00:22:42.020 --> 00:22:47.970
going to add a one-carbon
unit, a formate group.

00:22:47.970 --> 00:23:03.140
So remember, the formate carrier
comes from N10-formyl-THF.

00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:10.960
And so-- eraser--

00:23:22.850 --> 00:23:26.580
going to come from
N10-formyl-THF, all right?

00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:37.690
So that's going to take
the one-carbon unit off

00:23:37.690 --> 00:23:40.090
to regenerate THF, which,
of course, can pick up

00:23:40.090 --> 00:23:43.240
the one-carbon unit again
from serine and glycine,

00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:45.490
and then undergo an
oxidation reaction to get

00:23:45.490 --> 00:23:48.970
the formate group,
the N10-formyl-THF.

00:23:48.970 --> 00:24:23.380
And that generates
this intermediate,

00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:32.910
which is called FGAR for formyl
GAR, so formylglycinamide

00:24:32.910 --> 00:24:36.810
ribonucleotide, or FGAR.

00:24:36.810 --> 00:24:45.070
All right, the next step is
we're going to add a nitro--

00:24:45.070 --> 00:24:52.820
basically swap this oxygen here
on this carbonyl to a nitrogen,

00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:56.470
so a C double bond
to a nitrogen bond.

00:24:56.470 --> 00:24:59.230
And that requires--
so that's going

00:24:59.230 --> 00:25:02.260
to come from glutamine again.

00:25:02.260 --> 00:25:03.790
And it requires ATP.

00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:10.460
And it's somewhat of
a complex reaction.

00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:17.340
And I think it's--

00:25:20.580 --> 00:25:24.270
again, I will show you very
briefly how this works.

00:25:24.270 --> 00:25:27.090
If you don't follow all of
it, don't worry about it.

00:25:27.090 --> 00:25:33.030
But basically, if we just
draw the middle part here

00:25:33.030 --> 00:25:37.750
of the molecule, I don't want
to draw out the whole thing.

00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:42.220
So basically, this is
phosphorylation here.

00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:45.720
So the phosphate from
ATP transferred here

00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:48.120
to give this intermediate.

00:25:55.330 --> 00:26:17.300
That will lose a water,
giving this intermediate.

00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:27.290
Then the ammonia from
glutamine to glutamate

00:26:27.290 --> 00:26:31.940
come here, release
the phosphate.

00:26:49.370 --> 00:26:53.570
And then typically, this
is drawn where we just

00:26:53.570 --> 00:26:55.910
rearrange the double bond.

00:26:55.910 --> 00:27:11.860
And one ends up with
this intermediate,

00:27:11.860 --> 00:27:13.020
which is called FGAM.

00:27:57.860 --> 00:28:00.050
So this is this
intermediate, which

00:28:00.050 --> 00:28:20.000
is FGAM for formyl glycinamide
ribonucleotide, so FGAM.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:24.130
All right, makes sense?

00:28:24.130 --> 00:28:32.110
All right, the next reaction
is also a little bit complex

00:28:32.110 --> 00:28:34.450
and maybe hard to see.

00:28:34.450 --> 00:28:35.890
Again, I will draw it out.

00:28:35.890 --> 00:28:38.320
If you don't follow all of
it, don't worry about it.

00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:40.780
But it's nice for
those of you who

00:28:40.780 --> 00:28:43.340
want to follow it to
see what's happening.

00:28:43.340 --> 00:28:46.990
So again, now we're going
to take another ATP,

00:28:46.990 --> 00:28:53.380
hydrolyze it to ADP plus
Pi, release of water.

00:28:53.380 --> 00:28:55.630
And in the end, what
we're going to generate

00:28:55.630 --> 00:29:40.570
is we're going to close this
ring to generate-- so we're

00:29:40.570 --> 00:29:43.390
going to close
that ring, so make

00:29:43.390 --> 00:29:47.050
a bond from this nitrogen to
this carbon, close this ring.

00:29:47.050 --> 00:29:56.076
This generates this intermediate
called AIR, or amino ribo--

00:29:56.076 --> 00:30:03.288
sorry, aminoimidazole
ribonucleotide.

00:30:06.030 --> 00:30:07.530
Don't worry about
the long names.

00:30:07.530 --> 00:30:09.930
Everyone would just call it AIR.

00:30:09.930 --> 00:30:11.980
So how does this happen?

00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:13.530
Well, it happens as follows.

00:30:29.130 --> 00:30:37.820
So first step is
phosphorylation of--

00:30:37.820 --> 00:30:41.120
so ATP will phosphorylate
the aldehyde

00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:43.980
to give this intermediate.

00:30:48.580 --> 00:30:49.420
Water's lost.

00:31:01.670 --> 00:31:10.755
OK, now you have this
nitrogen down here, can--

00:31:16.260 --> 00:31:18.030
losing the phosphate.

00:31:20.630 --> 00:31:31.710
OK, so that will end
up closing the ring

00:31:31.710 --> 00:31:34.320
on that side of the molecule.

00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:39.870
And then all I've done is I've
just removed the electrons

00:31:39.870 --> 00:31:43.620
here so that rather than being
a carbon-nitrogen double bond,

00:31:43.620 --> 00:31:46.680
it's now a carbon-carbon
double bond.

00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:51.990
And that generates FGAM
to AIR, costing an ATP--

00:31:51.990 --> 00:31:56.900
again, one of the more
complicated reactions to see.

00:31:56.900 --> 00:31:58.805
Again, if you're into
how the reactions work,

00:31:58.805 --> 00:32:02.270
hopefully I gave you enough
information to understand it.

00:32:02.270 --> 00:32:07.810
If you're not, just realize
that this is the next step.

00:32:07.810 --> 00:32:14.320
OK, the next step is a reaction
that's very similar to one

00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:16.960
that we saw in the urea cycle.

00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:21.160
And that is we
are going to add--

00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:22.210
oh, sorry.

00:32:22.210 --> 00:32:27.010
The next step is one that--

00:32:27.010 --> 00:32:27.560
sorry.

00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:29.140
Before we do that
step, the next step

00:32:29.140 --> 00:32:34.370
is one where we're going to
add a CO2 group to this carbon.

00:32:34.370 --> 00:32:37.000
So that's a
carboxylation reaction.

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:40.300
You would typically think
of a carboxylation reaction

00:32:40.300 --> 00:32:42.490
to involve biotin.

00:32:42.490 --> 00:32:44.860
This is one that doesn't.

00:32:44.860 --> 00:32:48.730
It's an exception to that
rule, does not involve biotin.

00:32:48.730 --> 00:32:50.825
But it does involve ATP.

00:32:55.090 --> 00:33:02.200
OK, so remember, the way
we did this before is we

00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:07.420
would have phosphorylation
of our bicarbonate.

00:33:07.420 --> 00:33:11.050
So use ATP to
phosphorylate bicarbonate.

00:33:11.050 --> 00:33:32.460
And so if we just draw this
part of the molecule here,

00:33:32.460 --> 00:33:36.510
displacing the phosphate, and
then what we end up with is--

00:33:51.030 --> 00:33:53.020
OK, we end up with that.

00:33:53.020 --> 00:33:55.650
And if I just rearrange so
that the double bond is here

00:33:55.650 --> 00:34:34.270
instead of there, then we end
up with this next intermediate,

00:34:34.270 --> 00:34:49.760
which is CAIR or carboxy-AIR,
so CAIR or carboxy-AIR.

00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:51.960
All right, now we
get to the step

00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:56.760
that's very similar to the one
that we saw in the urea cycle

00:34:56.760 --> 00:34:59.880
where we're going to use
aspartate to fumerate

00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:06.550
conversion to add a nitrogen
to this carboxylic acid.

00:35:06.550 --> 00:35:16.930
And so you'll remember that way
we did that in the urea cycle

00:35:16.930 --> 00:35:23.380
is we used ATP to AMP
conversion to end up

00:35:23.380 --> 00:35:25.900
adding that aspartate group.

00:35:25.900 --> 00:35:29.650
In this case, it's just
ATP to ADP plus Pi.

00:35:29.650 --> 00:35:41.760
OK, so that's going to
phosphorylate this acid group.

00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:43.830
OK, so I'm not going to
draw the whole thing.

00:35:43.830 --> 00:35:45.500
Phosphorylate that,
and then we'll

00:35:45.500 --> 00:35:49.880
have an aspartate molecule.

00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:12.070
OK, so this is the
amino acid aspartate.

00:36:17.962 --> 00:36:20.350
OK, and one gets--

00:37:17.930 --> 00:37:23.330
didn't leave myself
enough room, but that's

00:37:23.330 --> 00:37:32.740
an aspartate molecule bound up
there to that carboxylic acid,

00:37:32.740 --> 00:37:33.950
just like we saw before.

00:37:33.950 --> 00:37:38.200
This is a molecule
called SAICAR,

00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:40.720
which is succinyl
amino imidazole

00:37:40.720 --> 00:38:01.090
carboxy amide ribonucleotide.

00:38:01.090 --> 00:38:05.410
OK, definitely everyone
calls it SAICAR.

00:38:05.410 --> 00:38:08.650
Now just as we saw then
from the urea cycle,

00:38:08.650 --> 00:38:13.620
we are now going to
take off a fumerate.

00:38:19.060 --> 00:38:24.220
OK, so this is reaction
that you've seen before.

00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:37.840
OK, just like we saw in the
urea cycle, so that reaction,

00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:39.280
lose the fumerate.

00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:42.190
And what you're left
with is basically

00:38:42.190 --> 00:38:45.715
just the nitrogen left behind.

00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:22.830
OK, and you get
this intermediate,

00:39:22.830 --> 00:39:27.860
which is referred
to as AICAR, so

00:39:27.860 --> 00:39:31.820
amino-imidazole-carboxy-amide
ribonucleotide,

00:39:31.820 --> 00:39:36.670
so minus the succinate
group, AICAR.

00:39:36.670 --> 00:39:42.700
OK, next step is we're
going to use a formate group

00:39:42.700 --> 00:39:51.690
and add it to this nitrogen.
So that's straightforward.

00:39:51.690 --> 00:39:55.440
So if we draw out
here our formate group

00:39:55.440 --> 00:40:17.750
from N10-formyl-THF, so that
will be our N10-formyl-THF,

00:40:17.750 --> 00:40:19.880
generate THF.

00:40:19.880 --> 00:40:21.425
And then we get--

00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:08.870
OK, let me get that
formate group added there.

00:41:08.870 --> 00:41:18.400
And so this is FAICAR,
or formyl AICAR, FAICAR.

00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:24.210
All right, next step is we're
going to close the ring.

00:41:30.730 --> 00:41:35.995
And so close the ring,
that's going to give this.

00:41:45.710 --> 00:41:50.350
OK, so that part of the
molecule where the ring closes,

00:41:50.350 --> 00:41:55.480
it just rearrange like
that to lose water.

00:42:05.550 --> 00:43:15.580
And that is going to generate
our purine ring the way

00:43:15.580 --> 00:43:19.150
you're used to seeing it drawn.

00:43:19.150 --> 00:43:29.170
And so this is the purine IMP
for inosine monophosphate.

00:43:29.170 --> 00:43:36.730
And inosine monophosphate is
the precursor for all purines.

00:43:36.730 --> 00:43:40.220
And so if you look at this,
what you see is that in the end,

00:43:40.220 --> 00:43:45.040
there is two nitrogens that come
from ammonia, from glutamine

00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:47.470
to glutamate, from the ammonia
released from glutamine

00:43:47.470 --> 00:43:51.130
to glutamate, one nitrogen
here that comes from glycine,

00:43:51.130 --> 00:43:54.160
and that nitrogen there
that comes from aspartate.

00:43:54.160 --> 00:43:58.420
Two of the carbons, these two,
come from the formate group,

00:43:58.420 --> 00:44:01.030
from N10-formyl-THF.

00:44:01.030 --> 00:44:04.840
Another carbon up
here comes from CO2.

00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:06.880
And the remaining
two carbons here

00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:10.370
come from a glycine
molecule, with, of course,

00:44:10.370 --> 00:44:14.020
the ribose phosphate from PRPP.

00:44:14.020 --> 00:44:16.150
And so if you go
through, what you'll find

00:44:16.150 --> 00:44:18.820
is that it took
two ATP to generate

00:44:18.820 --> 00:44:22.330
the PRPP from ribose
phosphate-- so starting

00:44:22.330 --> 00:44:27.400
with a ribose phosphate, two ATP
to generate the PRPP, and then

00:44:27.400 --> 00:44:28.922
five additional ATPs.

00:44:28.922 --> 00:44:30.880
So if you go up and look
through all the steps,

00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:34.150
there are five steps that
require ATP, so quite

00:44:34.150 --> 00:44:38.410
a lot of ATP to generate
this purine ring,

00:44:38.410 --> 00:44:41.080
inosine monophosphate.

00:44:41.080 --> 00:44:45.610
Now, inosine is not
found in RNA or DNA.

00:44:45.610 --> 00:44:47.980
And so this has to
be, of course, turned

00:44:47.980 --> 00:44:49.690
into adenine and guanine.

00:44:49.690 --> 00:44:51.890
And so how does that happen?

00:44:51.890 --> 00:44:52.900
Well, I'll show you.

00:44:52.900 --> 00:44:59.900
And so turning it, inosine
monophosphate into adenine,

00:44:59.900 --> 00:45:04.790
basically involves
putting a nitrogen here

00:45:04.790 --> 00:45:07.220
instead of this
double bond to oxygen.

00:45:07.220 --> 00:45:11.570
And so that occurs
via a very similar--

00:45:11.570 --> 00:45:14.000
in fact, the same
reaction, that we

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:21.560
saw to take CAIR and
generate SAICAR, all right?

00:45:21.560 --> 00:45:25.910
And so it was basically
using aspartate to transfer

00:45:25.910 --> 00:45:28.283
that nitrogen. I
don't have time to go

00:45:28.283 --> 00:45:29.450
through the whole mechanism.

00:45:29.450 --> 00:45:34.230
But it's basically what
I already showed you.

00:45:34.230 --> 00:45:42.740
And so you take GTP plus
acetate, get GDP plus Pi.

00:45:42.740 --> 00:45:46.430
Note, you use
guanine triphosphate,

00:45:46.430 --> 00:45:49.370
so GTP rather than ATP,
to end up generating

00:45:49.370 --> 00:45:51.530
the adenine nucleotide.

00:45:51.530 --> 00:45:55.370
All right, it's going
to release water.

00:45:55.370 --> 00:46:00.050
Water was also released
in that reaction.

00:46:00.050 --> 00:46:03.710
And what you end up with
is this intermediate.

00:46:03.710 --> 00:46:05.750
So I'm not going to
draw the whole structure

00:46:05.750 --> 00:46:08.090
for the sake of time.

00:46:08.090 --> 00:46:14.710
But this here would be the
top here of the purine ring.

00:46:14.710 --> 00:46:16.215
So this would have a--

00:46:26.820 --> 00:46:32.910
so that's going to add an
aspartate molecule up there.

00:46:32.910 --> 00:46:39.060
And then from that, we're
going to release fumerate.

00:46:47.700 --> 00:46:49.770
OK, so fumerate comes off.

00:46:52.490 --> 00:46:54.725
And what we're left with is--

00:47:19.780 --> 00:47:26.320
OK, and this here is
adenosine monophosphate, AMP.

00:47:26.320 --> 00:47:31.440
And, of course, I can just
take two phosphorylation events

00:47:31.440 --> 00:47:32.635
and get ATP.

00:47:36.030 --> 00:47:39.900
Basically, phospho
transfer ATP to make ADP,

00:47:39.900 --> 00:47:42.390
and then, ultimately,
ADP to make

00:47:42.390 --> 00:47:46.540
ATP via glycolysis, oxidative
phosphorylation, whatever.

00:47:46.540 --> 00:47:51.470
And so that's how you
generate adenine nucleotides.

00:47:51.470 --> 00:47:56.060
Generate guanine nucleotides,
what has to happen

00:47:56.060 --> 00:48:01.460
is that we need to
put a nitrogen here.

00:48:01.460 --> 00:48:05.990
OK, so putting a
nitrogen on this carbon,

00:48:05.990 --> 00:48:10.520
first thing that
happens is we add water

00:48:10.520 --> 00:48:12.530
across that double bond.

00:48:24.510 --> 00:48:27.750
OK, so that's this part
here of the molecule,

00:48:27.750 --> 00:48:32.010
added water across
that double bond.

00:48:32.010 --> 00:48:37.770
Now we're going to oxidize
this carbon-nitrogen bond,

00:48:37.770 --> 00:48:40.155
seen this a million times--

00:48:42.890 --> 00:48:44.900
generates a hydride ion.

00:48:44.900 --> 00:48:47.540
What's that hydride
ion-- or sorry,

00:48:47.540 --> 00:48:52.830
oxidize this alcohol
to the ketone,

00:48:52.830 --> 00:48:54.860
so generates a hydride ion.

00:48:54.860 --> 00:49:00.740
Those electrons go to
NAD+, generate an NADH,

00:49:00.740 --> 00:49:02.630
oxidation reaction.

00:49:02.630 --> 00:49:04.505
And that gives us this.

00:49:17.730 --> 00:49:22.390
OK, and then the next
step is that we're

00:49:22.390 --> 00:49:26.230
going to take that ketone
that was generated here,

00:49:26.230 --> 00:49:30.070
and we're going to turn
it into, basically,

00:49:30.070 --> 00:49:33.010
replace that oxygen
with a nitrogen.

00:49:33.010 --> 00:49:36.100
And so that's exactly the
reaction that we saw when

00:49:36.100 --> 00:49:40.000
we went here from FGAR to FGAM.

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:43.420
All right, so if I
go from same reaction

00:49:43.420 --> 00:49:48.230
that I used to go
from FGAR to FGAM,

00:49:48.230 --> 00:49:56.410
so this is ATP goes
to ADP plus Pi.

00:49:56.410 --> 00:50:02.440
All right, nitrogen
comes here from glutamine

00:50:02.440 --> 00:50:08.780
to glutamate, same
reaction that occurs there.

00:50:08.780 --> 00:50:10.450
Water comes off.

00:50:10.450 --> 00:50:15.760
What I end up doing
is I replace this.

00:50:15.760 --> 00:50:19.800
I'll end up getting
this structure instead.

00:50:19.800 --> 00:50:21.900
And then I can just
rearrange the double bond

00:50:21.900 --> 00:50:26.310
to be on the ring rather than to
the nitrogen outside the ring.

00:50:26.310 --> 00:50:27.510
And that generates--

00:50:51.660 --> 00:50:56.690
OK, and so this is GMP.

00:50:56.690 --> 00:51:01.970
Notice that the ATP
was used to make GMP.

00:51:01.970 --> 00:51:04.790
GTP was used to make AMP.

00:51:04.790 --> 00:51:09.110
So use the opposite purine
to make each reaction.

00:51:09.110 --> 00:51:11.150
I know I went through
these quickly,

00:51:11.150 --> 00:51:13.550
just don't have time to
go into it in more detail.

00:51:13.550 --> 00:51:17.300
But it's really just
repurposing similar reactions

00:51:17.300 --> 00:51:19.250
that are involved
in purine synthesis

00:51:19.250 --> 00:51:22.520
to end up changing this
inosine monophosphate

00:51:22.520 --> 00:51:26.390
into AMP or into GMP.

00:51:26.390 --> 00:51:28.730
And I guess for
consistency, I should

00:51:28.730 --> 00:51:31.430
have drawn that in yellow
because the nitrogen comes

00:51:31.430 --> 00:51:34.070
from the glutamine.

00:51:34.070 --> 00:51:36.980
OK, so that is purine synthesis.

00:51:36.980 --> 00:51:40.010
That's how you get AMP and GMP.

00:51:40.010 --> 00:51:43.700
If you're going to
break these things down,

00:51:43.700 --> 00:51:47.990
of course, you're going
to use separate pathways.

00:51:47.990 --> 00:51:49.940
Why are you going to
use separate pathways?

00:51:49.940 --> 00:51:53.150
Well, because as we've
heard over and over again

00:51:53.150 --> 00:51:55.670
in the class, for
thermodynamic reasons,

00:51:55.670 --> 00:51:58.790
delta G has to be less than
0 for any pathway to work,

00:51:58.790 --> 00:52:00.710
can't be less than 0
in both directions.

00:52:00.710 --> 00:52:02.510
One direction
needs energy input.

00:52:02.510 --> 00:52:07.550
I had energy input to make
these purine nucleotides.

00:52:07.550 --> 00:52:11.330
Opposite direction don't
need energy to make it.

00:52:11.330 --> 00:52:14.210
I don't have time to
get into all the details

00:52:14.210 --> 00:52:15.680
of purine breakdown.

00:52:15.680 --> 00:52:18.140
Although, here are some things.

00:52:18.140 --> 00:52:22.560
I just summarize it here
for you on this slide.

00:52:22.560 --> 00:52:26.090
Basically, you start from AMP.

00:52:26.090 --> 00:52:27.410
You take the phosphate off.

00:52:27.410 --> 00:52:28.970
You end up generating adenosine.

00:52:28.970 --> 00:52:33.110
You end up going to
inosine, remove the ribose.

00:52:33.110 --> 00:52:35.360
Then you get another base.

00:52:35.360 --> 00:52:38.390
And the base on
inosine monophosphate,

00:52:38.390 --> 00:52:42.980
when it's just the base, so the
nucleoside and nucleotide is

00:52:42.980 --> 00:52:45.890
inosine, when you get
rid of the ribose,

00:52:45.890 --> 00:52:49.790
now the base is
called hypoxanthine.

00:52:49.790 --> 00:52:52.880
It's a little bit of
a confusing thing.

00:52:52.880 --> 00:52:55.100
But just recognize
that hypoxanthine

00:52:55.100 --> 00:52:58.680
is the base that is found
on inosine or inosine

00:52:58.680 --> 00:53:00.500
monophosphate, all right?

00:53:00.500 --> 00:53:04.770
And so just to
summarize what I showed

00:53:04.770 --> 00:53:10.080
you what was on the slide,
so to break down AMP,

00:53:10.080 --> 00:53:12.270
you'd remove the phosphate.

00:53:12.270 --> 00:53:15.960
Now you end up with the
nucleoside adenosine.

00:53:15.960 --> 00:53:20.795
So that's adenine
plus the ribose.

00:53:24.560 --> 00:53:30.860
Take off the nitrogen to move
back to the nucleoside inosine.

00:53:30.860 --> 00:53:34.970
Now we can remove the
ribose from inosine.

00:53:34.970 --> 00:53:38.210
What we're left with is the
base, which is hypoxanthine.

00:53:40.740 --> 00:53:45.050
OK, so I'll draw out
hypoxanthine for you here.

00:53:56.740 --> 00:54:01.030
OK, so hypoxanthine,
you'll see is basically

00:54:01.030 --> 00:54:04.690
exactly what we drew out
for inosine monophosphate.

00:54:04.690 --> 00:54:09.790
It's just the base from inosine
monophosphate is hypoxanthine.

00:54:09.790 --> 00:54:15.550
Now if we oxidize this
carbon-nitrogen bond, which

00:54:15.550 --> 00:54:20.740
is carried out by a
complex oxidation reaction,

00:54:20.740 --> 00:54:27.730
requiring oxygen and water and
producing hydrogen peroxide

00:54:27.730 --> 00:54:35.480
by an enzyme called
xanthine oxidase.

00:54:43.810 --> 00:54:47.800
OK, so the enzyme xanthine
oxidase-- interesting enzyme--

00:54:47.800 --> 00:54:50.110
has a molybdenum group.

00:54:50.110 --> 00:54:53.215
And in it, is a cofactor
and iron and FAD--

00:54:53.215 --> 00:54:56.680
a complex redox reaction we
don't have time to get into--

00:54:56.680 --> 00:55:01.600
ends up generating
this purine base.

00:55:17.340 --> 00:55:25.420
OK, this purine
base is xanthine.

00:55:25.420 --> 00:55:36.940
Xanthine oxidase,
same enzyme, can also

00:55:36.940 --> 00:55:40.690
use the same
chemistry to oxidize

00:55:40.690 --> 00:55:43.080
this nitrogen-carbon bond.

00:55:43.080 --> 00:55:47.140
So this one here, when
it was oxidized there,

00:55:47.140 --> 00:55:49.700
now we're going to
oxidize this one here.

00:55:49.700 --> 00:55:51.340
And what does that generate?

00:56:00.830 --> 00:56:12.610
That generates this
compound, uric acid.

00:56:12.610 --> 00:56:16.080
And so for the birds and
reptiles to excrete nitrogen,

00:56:16.080 --> 00:56:20.190
it would synthesize
a purine like AMP,

00:56:20.190 --> 00:56:22.680
and then break it
down to uric acid

00:56:22.680 --> 00:56:28.320
as a way to eliminate
nitrogen, all right?

00:56:28.320 --> 00:56:36.220
Guanine GMP, lose
a phosphate, you

00:56:36.220 --> 00:56:42.550
get the nucleoside guanosine,
so guanine the base,

00:56:42.550 --> 00:56:45.610
plus the ribose
with no phosphate.

00:56:45.610 --> 00:56:49.070
Take the ribose group off.

00:56:49.070 --> 00:56:50.315
Now we're left with guanine.

00:56:53.450 --> 00:57:01.430
And then if we
start with guanine,

00:57:01.430 --> 00:57:08.210
remove nitrogen from guanine,
then we end up with xanthine.

00:57:08.210 --> 00:57:11.840
OK, so remember, there was
additional oxidation step

00:57:11.840 --> 00:57:14.780
to make GMP that
wasn't there in AMP.

00:57:14.780 --> 00:57:16.850
That means we get a more
oxidized product back

00:57:16.850 --> 00:57:17.790
when we break it down.

00:57:17.790 --> 00:57:19.400
So it's broken down to xanthine.

00:57:19.400 --> 00:57:23.820
And that can be acted on
also to generate uric acid.

00:57:23.820 --> 00:57:26.090
And so you could also
make GMP, and then

00:57:26.090 --> 00:57:28.460
break down the GMP to
make uric acid as a way

00:57:28.460 --> 00:57:31.740
to excrete nitrogen.

00:57:31.740 --> 00:57:34.840
Now uric acid is also
medically important in humans.

00:57:34.840 --> 00:57:37.840
This is, of course, the thing
that is the cause of gout.

00:57:37.840 --> 00:57:42.540
So gout is uric acid, is
produced in excess, deposits

00:57:42.540 --> 00:57:45.850
and crystallizes in joints
and causes a lot of pain.

00:57:45.850 --> 00:57:49.380
And one way to treat gout
is with a xanthine oxidase

00:57:49.380 --> 00:57:49.990
inhibitor.

00:57:49.990 --> 00:57:51.720
There's a drug
called allopurinol

00:57:51.720 --> 00:57:54.300
that inhibits xanthine oxidase.

00:57:54.300 --> 00:57:58.410
And that ends up
being a way to slow

00:57:58.410 --> 00:58:02.920
the production of uric acid and
can treat patients with gout.

00:58:02.920 --> 00:58:08.860
All right, now, if
you break down purines

00:58:08.860 --> 00:58:14.980
and you want to recapture
them, you can also use salvage.

00:58:14.980 --> 00:58:19.140
And so to save some
time, here I drew out,

00:58:19.140 --> 00:58:22.380
basically, the salvage
pathways for purines.

00:58:22.380 --> 00:58:24.120
And so you can
start with adenine,

00:58:24.120 --> 00:58:25.800
or you can start with guanine.

00:58:25.800 --> 00:58:27.990
Or you can start
with hypoxanthine.

00:58:27.990 --> 00:58:31.980
And basically, these are
simply added to PRPP.

00:58:31.980 --> 00:58:35.870
So if you take adenine, add
it to PRPP, now you have AMP.

00:58:35.870 --> 00:58:40.500
If you take hypoxanthine, add
it to PRPP, now you have IMP.

00:58:40.500 --> 00:58:43.500
And you can use that IMP
to then synthesize AMP,

00:58:43.500 --> 00:58:48.240
or not shown here, GMP, by the
pathways I've already shown.

00:58:48.240 --> 00:58:50.850
Or if you have guanine, you
can salvage that guanine,

00:58:50.850 --> 00:58:55.230
add it to PRPP, and
then generate GMP.

00:58:55.230 --> 00:58:57.405
And so different
enzymes do this.

00:58:57.405 --> 00:59:00.210
This enzyme here,
hypoxanthine-guanine

00:59:00.210 --> 00:59:01.980
phosphoribosyltransferase,
which is

00:59:01.980 --> 00:59:04.260
how you take guanine
or hypoxanthine

00:59:04.260 --> 00:59:07.860
and make IMP or GMP
via salvage pathway

00:59:07.860 --> 00:59:11.970
is actually a very famous
enzyme because it's

00:59:11.970 --> 00:59:14.310
part of an inborn area
of metabolism called

00:59:14.310 --> 00:59:17.790
Lesch-Nyhan syndrome
or hypoguanine

00:59:17.790 --> 00:59:22.130
phosphoribosyltransferase
or HPRT.

00:59:25.850 --> 00:59:32.685
So HPRT deficiency is what
causes Lesch-Nyhan syndrome.

00:59:36.200 --> 00:59:38.380
And it's an inborn
error of metabolism.

00:59:38.380 --> 00:59:42.700
You're deficient in
this HGPRT enzyme,

00:59:42.700 --> 00:59:46.150
which means you can't salvage
guanine or hypoxanthine.

00:59:46.150 --> 00:59:50.080
Now I bring this up, not because
we have time to talk about all

00:59:50.080 --> 00:59:53.170
of the inborn errors
of metabolism,

00:59:53.170 --> 00:59:57.070
but mentioning this
one really points out

00:59:57.070 --> 00:59:58.660
that we don't
understand metabolism

00:59:58.660 --> 01:00:00.410
as well as we think we do.

01:00:00.410 --> 01:00:01.990
So if I ask you to
predict what would

01:00:01.990 --> 01:00:03.940
be the consequences
of an inability

01:00:03.940 --> 01:00:06.460
to salvage guanine
and hypoxanthine,

01:00:06.460 --> 01:00:09.550
you might say, oh,
well, that means

01:00:09.550 --> 01:00:12.160
that you're going to not be
able to take these things up.

01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:16.330
Maybe you'll have excess guanine
and hypoxanthine breakdown.

01:00:16.330 --> 01:00:19.960
And maybe you'll get more
uric acid and get gout.

01:00:19.960 --> 01:00:21.370
And that's absolutely the case.

01:00:21.370 --> 01:00:25.510
Patients with Lesch-Nyhan
syndrome, HPRT deficiency,

01:00:25.510 --> 01:00:27.010
do indeed get gout.

01:00:27.010 --> 01:00:28.430
That makes sense.

01:00:28.430 --> 01:00:30.040
But the main problem
they have is they

01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:32.260
have a self
mutilation phenotype.

01:00:32.260 --> 01:00:37.090
They have a mental retardation,
a lot of neurological stuff.

01:00:37.090 --> 01:00:39.880
And no one can
really explain why

01:00:39.880 --> 01:00:44.740
it is that one gets this
complex neurological phenotype

01:00:44.740 --> 01:00:49.570
because you can't salvage
guanine and hypoxanthine.

01:00:49.570 --> 01:00:53.740
The salvage of purines,
which, again, I show here

01:00:53.740 --> 01:01:00.220
on a slide, really that shows
all of the different enzymes

01:01:00.220 --> 01:01:02.980
and ways here is
that HPRT to salvage

01:01:02.980 --> 01:01:07.570
guanine and hypoxanthine
to make IMP and GMP.

01:01:07.570 --> 01:01:11.350
There's actually
quite complex enzymes

01:01:11.350 --> 01:01:15.340
that can allow you to
basically interconvert

01:01:15.340 --> 01:01:19.330
all of these nucleosides
with nucleotides as well

01:01:19.330 --> 01:01:23.410
as with the free purine bases.

01:01:23.410 --> 01:01:27.910
Each of these enzymes has its
own syndrome associated with it

01:01:27.910 --> 01:01:30.820
if there's humans
that are deficient.

01:01:30.820 --> 01:01:33.940
Some of it causes
immune system problems.

01:01:33.940 --> 01:01:35.860
There's the mental
problems I talked about

01:01:35.860 --> 01:01:38.170
with HPRT deficiency.

01:01:38.170 --> 01:01:42.370
Again, why certain
enzymes and pathways

01:01:42.370 --> 01:01:46.510
are more important in
specific cells and tissues,

01:01:46.510 --> 01:01:49.330
not so well understood.

01:01:49.330 --> 01:01:51.160
And really, what I
want you to appreciate

01:01:51.160 --> 01:01:53.020
is that this is
complicated and just

01:01:53.020 --> 01:01:56.530
realize that this happens
in case you encounter it

01:01:56.530 --> 01:01:58.360
in your first future
career and you

01:01:58.360 --> 01:02:01.020
want to come back and study it.

01:02:01.020 --> 01:02:01.520
OK.

01:02:05.870 --> 01:02:08.780
All right, so we just
went through the way

01:02:08.780 --> 01:02:12.110
that you can salvage purines
or make purines de novo.

01:02:12.110 --> 01:02:15.380
And of course, that gives
you ribonucleotides that

01:02:15.380 --> 01:02:18.260
can be used to generate RNA.

01:02:18.260 --> 01:02:20.735
If you're going to
generate DNA, you then

01:02:20.735 --> 01:02:23.750
need to, instead of generating
the ribonucleotides,

01:02:23.750 --> 01:02:27.830
end up with the
deoxyribonucleoside

01:02:27.830 --> 01:02:29.300
triphosphates.

01:02:29.300 --> 01:02:30.480
And what does that mean?

01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:32.270
So if we draw here, here's a--

01:02:43.280 --> 01:02:48.260
for whatever base, adenine,
guanine, whatever, basically,

01:02:48.260 --> 01:02:51.920
if we're going to generate
a deoxyribonucleoside,

01:02:51.920 --> 01:02:55.430
we have to-- remember, this
is the 2 position of ribose.

01:02:55.430 --> 01:02:59.510
And so we need to reduce
this 2 position of ribose--

01:02:59.510 --> 01:03:02.810
basically, reduce
it from the alcohol

01:03:02.810 --> 01:03:17.160
to the saturated
hydrocarbon to generate

01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:21.390
the deoxyribonucleoside.

01:03:21.390 --> 01:03:28.870
This is carried out
by an enzyme called

01:03:28.870 --> 01:03:30.820
ribonucleotide reductase.

01:03:39.400 --> 01:03:42.330
Makes sense-- we're
doing a redox reaction,

01:03:42.330 --> 01:03:47.010
reducing that alcohol to
saturated hydrocarbon,

01:03:47.010 --> 01:03:49.860
ribonucleotide reductase.

01:03:49.860 --> 01:03:51.930
Interesting mechanism,
you can look it up

01:03:51.930 --> 01:03:53.190
if you're interested.

01:03:53.190 --> 01:03:56.610
Ribonucleotide reductase, I
drew it this way on purpose,

01:03:56.610 --> 01:04:04.500
always acts on the dNDP, so
the nucleoside diphosphate--

01:04:04.500 --> 01:04:07.680
sorry, on the
nucleoside diphosphate

01:04:07.680 --> 01:04:12.330
to generate the
deoxynucleoside--

01:04:12.330 --> 01:04:15.810
sorry, deoxynucleotide
diphosphate.

01:04:15.810 --> 01:04:21.060
So the nucleotide diphosphate
is what ribonucleotide reductase

01:04:21.060 --> 01:04:27.180
acts on to generate the
deoxynucleotide diphosphate.

01:04:27.180 --> 01:04:33.540
So you would take ADP
and generate dADP, GDP,

01:04:33.540 --> 01:04:36.830
and generate dGDP.

01:04:36.830 --> 01:04:38.630
All right, and we'll
come back to this

01:04:38.630 --> 01:04:41.000
in a minute for pyrimidines.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.190
Before I get to that, I
just want to quickly go

01:04:43.190 --> 01:04:45.740
through pyrimidine synthesis.

01:04:45.740 --> 01:04:49.970
And so pyrimidine
synthesis is a lot simpler

01:04:49.970 --> 01:04:52.160
than purine synthesis.

01:04:52.160 --> 01:04:55.280
I also like to point out that
pyrimidines are also much less

01:04:55.280 --> 01:04:57.680
abundant in cells than purines.

01:04:57.680 --> 01:05:00.750
So remember, ATP, 10
millimolar concentration in

01:05:00.750 --> 01:05:02.960
cells, 1 to 10 millimolar--

01:05:02.960 --> 01:05:07.430
GTP, somewhere in the high
hundreds of micromolar.

01:05:07.430 --> 01:05:10.190
Purines are more--
sorry, pyrimidines

01:05:10.190 --> 01:05:11.990
are more tens of micromolar.

01:05:11.990 --> 01:05:16.190
And so orders of magnitude, less
pyrimidines in cells than there

01:05:16.190 --> 01:05:17.420
are purines.

01:05:17.420 --> 01:05:19.580
And that's because
GTP, ATP, those

01:05:19.580 --> 01:05:22.430
are important energy
transduction molecules.

01:05:22.430 --> 01:05:24.770
We saw a couple places
where pyrimidines can be

01:05:24.770 --> 01:05:26.810
energy transduction molecules--

01:05:26.810 --> 01:05:28.800
UTP, glucose, et cetera.

01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:33.620
But in general, most
reactions use ATP and GTP

01:05:33.620 --> 01:05:37.380
as energy sources.

01:05:37.380 --> 01:05:41.600
And so whereas
pyrimidines are primarily

01:05:41.600 --> 01:05:46.310
for building RNA and DNA, and
so much less abundant in cells.

01:05:46.310 --> 01:05:50.120
All right, so
pyrimidine synthesis--

01:05:52.930 --> 01:05:53.625
get my colors.

01:05:59.700 --> 01:06:07.190
So pyrimidine synthesis starts
with carbamoyl phosphate.

01:06:07.190 --> 01:06:10.360
And so you'll remember
carbamoyl phosphate

01:06:10.360 --> 01:06:16.230
from when we discussed
the urea cycle.

01:06:16.230 --> 01:06:21.835
OK, so just as a quick
reminder, so here's bicarbonate.

01:06:21.835 --> 01:06:25.550
I won't use colors to
start, just for time.

01:06:25.550 --> 01:06:30.130
So if we phosphorylate
bicarbonate,

01:06:30.130 --> 01:06:36.070
we ended up getting this
molecule, that bicarbonate.

01:06:36.070 --> 01:06:42.230
We can then have glutamine
to glutamate conversion.

01:06:42.230 --> 01:06:45.670
That gives us--
releases an ammonia.

01:06:45.670 --> 01:06:53.410
That ammonia can
release that phosphate.

01:06:53.410 --> 01:07:00.610
So ATP to ADP plus
phosphate, then gives us

01:07:00.610 --> 01:07:08.700
this molecule, which we
can phosphorylate again

01:07:08.700 --> 01:07:33.520
to give us this molecule,
which is carbamoyl phosphate.

01:07:33.520 --> 01:07:37.480
Nothing new here, exactly
what we showed last time

01:07:37.480 --> 01:07:39.940
in the urea cycle.

01:07:39.940 --> 01:07:47.470
So carbamoyl phosphate
will react with aspartate.

01:07:52.840 --> 01:07:58.300
So here's aspartate, the
amino acid aspartate.

01:08:09.720 --> 01:08:36.479
OK, and that generates
this intermediate.

01:08:47.350 --> 01:08:50.529
OK, so that generates
that intermediate.

01:08:50.529 --> 01:08:58.779
This can now undergo
ring closure like that.

01:09:09.490 --> 01:09:13.649
And then we end
up with a molecule

01:09:13.649 --> 01:09:45.450
that looks like the familiar
ring structure for pyrimidine

01:09:45.450 --> 01:09:48.060
shown here, OK?

01:09:48.060 --> 01:09:50.160
I drew it this way
because the next step,

01:09:50.160 --> 01:09:52.669
so this molecule is
called dihydroorotate.

01:09:58.710 --> 01:10:01.440
And the next step is
going to be to oxidize

01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:03.990
this carbon-carbon bond.

01:10:03.990 --> 01:10:08.610
If we oxidize this
carbon-carbon bond,

01:10:08.610 --> 01:10:11.520
that gives us hydride ion--

01:10:11.520 --> 01:10:13.620
oxidizing a
carbon-carbon bond, just

01:10:13.620 --> 01:10:16.770
like we saw in lipid
oxidation, just like we

01:10:16.770 --> 01:10:19.170
saw in succinate dehydrogenase.

01:10:19.170 --> 01:10:24.510
This is an FAD as an
electron acceptor.

01:10:24.510 --> 01:10:26.910
FAD is reduced to FADH2.

01:10:26.910 --> 01:10:29.250
This occurs as an
alternative to complex II

01:10:29.250 --> 01:10:30.650
in the electron transport chain.

01:10:30.650 --> 01:10:33.120
So this would occur in
the mitochondrial membrane

01:10:33.120 --> 01:10:35.370
and be a way to
take dihydroorotate

01:10:35.370 --> 01:10:38.250
to orotate, carried
out by an enzyme called

01:10:38.250 --> 01:10:43.590
dihydroorotate dehydrogenase
or DHODH, which ends up

01:10:43.590 --> 01:10:47.350
forming this alternate
electron transport chain,

01:10:47.350 --> 01:10:49.950
electrons ultimately
ending up as oxygen.

01:10:49.950 --> 01:10:56.050
And this generates the base
pyrimidine, the IMP equivalent,

01:10:56.050 --> 01:10:58.860
if you will, of a
pyrimidine, which

01:10:58.860 --> 01:11:31.500
is this molecule, which is
this molecule called orotate.

01:11:31.500 --> 01:11:40.770
And then orotate
will react with PRPP,

01:11:40.770 --> 01:11:44.830
generating a
pyrophosphate, which

01:11:44.830 --> 01:11:47.840
can be cleaved to two
inorganic phosphates,

01:11:47.840 --> 01:11:49.900
pull the reaction forward.

01:11:49.900 --> 01:11:53.770
And we end up with
this phosphoribose.

01:11:57.030 --> 01:12:03.330
And basically, this is going
to add to this nitrogen right

01:12:03.330 --> 01:12:04.080
here.

01:12:04.080 --> 01:12:05.790
And so you're used
to seeing it drawn

01:12:05.790 --> 01:12:07.920
if I add to that
nitrogen, and now

01:12:07.920 --> 01:12:12.360
rotate the molecule
in that direction.

01:12:36.790 --> 01:12:42.490
And you get this molecule,
which is orotate monophosphate,

01:12:42.490 --> 01:12:48.400
orotate monophosphate, which
is the starting pyrimidine.

01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:57.010
And simply decarboxylating
orotate monophosphate

01:12:57.010 --> 01:13:31.830
will give us the pyrimidine,
uridine monophosphate or UMP.

01:13:31.830 --> 01:13:39.990
OK, and so UMP
generated in that way.

01:13:39.990 --> 01:13:46.110
Now to turn UMP into
CTP, what happens

01:13:46.110 --> 01:13:50.220
is UMP is phosphorylated twice.

01:13:50.220 --> 01:13:52.320
So that's going to cost two ADP.

01:13:52.320 --> 01:13:55.110
That's going to generate a UTP.

01:13:55.110 --> 01:13:57.930
And then we're going
to take that UTP,

01:13:57.930 --> 01:14:01.650
and carry out, again, the same
reaction that you saw earlier

01:14:01.650 --> 01:14:07.650
for FGAR to FGAM, xanthine
monophosphate to guanine

01:14:07.650 --> 01:14:09.420
monophosphate.

01:14:09.420 --> 01:14:11.820
So I'm going to take
glutamine to glutamate,

01:14:11.820 --> 01:14:20.750
transfer the ammonia,
take ATP to ADP plus Pi.

01:14:20.750 --> 01:14:23.510
And basically what we're
going to end up doing

01:14:23.510 --> 01:14:30.220
is changing that double bond
oxygen, so double bond there,

01:14:30.220 --> 01:14:31.990
and an amino group on top.

01:14:31.990 --> 01:14:59.110
And that is how we generate
the other major purine,

01:14:59.110 --> 01:15:01.880
cytidine triphosphate-- or
another major pyrimidine,

01:15:01.880 --> 01:15:04.040
cytidine triphosphate.

01:15:04.040 --> 01:15:10.040
So UTP to CTP reaction that
we've already seen before

01:15:10.040 --> 01:15:13.220
gets us CTP.

01:15:13.220 --> 01:15:18.230
Now to get
deoxycytidine, obviously,

01:15:18.230 --> 01:15:21.410
remember ribonucleotide
reductase acts on

01:15:21.410 --> 01:15:25.460
the diphosphate, so
release of phosphates.

01:15:25.460 --> 01:15:27.740
So now we have
cytidine diphosphate.

01:15:27.740 --> 01:15:33.020
And now ribonucleotide
reductase can generate

01:15:33.020 --> 01:15:36.710
deoxycytidine diphosphate.

01:15:36.710 --> 01:15:39.320
Now remember, uracil
is not used in DNA.

01:15:39.320 --> 01:15:41.570
Instead of uracil,
we use thymidine.

01:15:41.570 --> 01:15:43.640
So there's no
deoxyuracil, or you

01:15:43.640 --> 01:15:45.980
don't want to make
deoxyuracil because that

01:15:45.980 --> 01:15:47.720
will incorporate into DNA.

01:15:47.720 --> 01:15:49.530
That's undesirable.

01:15:49.530 --> 01:15:54.080
And so the way you make
thymidine is you take dCDP

01:15:54.080 --> 01:15:57.740
and you further remove
a phosphate from it.

01:15:57.740 --> 01:15:59.025
And now you get dCMP.

01:16:02.090 --> 01:16:06.905
And then you take the dCMP, and
you convert it back to dUMP.

01:16:10.690 --> 01:16:15.370
Converting it back to dUMP
is basically just losing

01:16:15.370 --> 01:16:17.290
the nitrogen. We've
seen that before when

01:16:17.290 --> 01:16:19.030
we broke down guanine--

01:16:19.030 --> 01:16:22.180
same reaction,
dCMP back to dUMP.

01:16:22.180 --> 01:16:29.830
And then dUMP is a substrate
for an enzyme called thymidylate

01:16:29.830 --> 01:16:40.140
synthase, which will
take uracil and add

01:16:40.140 --> 01:16:47.750
a one-carbon unit there,
which is methyl group as D

01:16:47.750 --> 01:16:50.000
and generate thymidine.

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:51.810
So where does that come from?

01:16:51.810 --> 01:16:54.500
Well, we're going to
add a methyl group.

01:16:54.500 --> 01:16:56.270
We could do that
from the folate.

01:16:56.270 --> 01:16:59.840
Now you might guess that you'd
use 5-methyl-THF for this,

01:16:59.840 --> 01:17:01.850
but you actually don't.

01:17:01.850 --> 01:17:14.080
Instead, what you
use is this N5,

01:17:14.080 --> 01:17:24.790
N10-methyl methylene THF, which
we got directly from serine

01:17:24.790 --> 01:17:27.670
to glycine conversion.

01:17:27.670 --> 01:17:50.910
And so this then is going to add
the methyl group to have dUMP.

01:17:54.010 --> 01:17:56.710
So we're going to add
a methyl group there.

01:18:10.440 --> 01:18:15.250
And this is going
to give me dTMP.

01:18:15.250 --> 01:18:17.580
This is what thymidylate
synthase does.

01:18:17.580 --> 01:18:19.410
But I've added a methyl group.

01:18:19.410 --> 01:18:23.647
Remember, this is a
formaldehyde oxidation state.

01:18:23.647 --> 01:18:25.230
So if I'm going to
add a methyl group,

01:18:25.230 --> 01:18:27.540
that means that
one-carbon unit is getting

01:18:27.540 --> 01:18:29.940
reduced when it's being added.

01:18:29.940 --> 01:18:32.700
If it's being reduced, something
else has to be oxidized.

01:18:32.700 --> 01:18:37.840
And the thing that gets
oxidized is the folate itself.

01:18:37.840 --> 01:18:41.670
So this is-- the
tetrahydrofolate

01:18:41.670 --> 01:18:47.520
is oxidized to instead
be a dihydrofolate,

01:18:47.520 --> 01:18:50.170
so double bond here.

01:18:50.170 --> 01:18:52.950
So that's oxidation.

01:18:52.950 --> 01:18:56.444
Now it becomes dihydrofolate.

01:19:00.180 --> 01:19:02.550
And that dihydrofolate,
of course,

01:19:02.550 --> 01:19:09.000
has to be re-reduced back
to the tetrahydrofolate

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.910
and pick up a one-carbon unit.

01:19:11.910 --> 01:19:18.390
And so this comes
from NADPH to NADP+.

01:19:18.390 --> 01:19:22.680
So oxidze NADPH, reduce
dihydrofolate back

01:19:22.680 --> 01:19:26.160
to tetrahydrofolate, pick
up another one-carbon unit

01:19:26.160 --> 01:19:29.550
from serine to
glycine conversion.

01:19:29.550 --> 01:19:34.770
And in the end, this is how
you synthesize thymidine.

01:19:34.770 --> 01:19:36.670
I went through
this very quickly.

01:19:36.670 --> 01:19:38.820
But this is actually a
very important reaction

01:19:38.820 --> 01:19:40.320
pharmacologically.

01:19:40.320 --> 01:19:43.450
This is an important
target for antibiotics.

01:19:43.450 --> 01:19:47.310
So the antibiotic Bactrim,
a very famous antibiotic,

01:19:47.310 --> 01:19:55.140
basically blocks this step
called dihydrofolate reductase,

01:19:55.140 --> 01:20:00.510
dihydrofolate reductase, DHFR,
basically taking dihydrofolate

01:20:00.510 --> 01:20:04.770
back to tetrahydrofolate
before it can pick up

01:20:04.770 --> 01:20:06.840
a serine-glycine unit.

01:20:06.840 --> 01:20:11.760
Effects on the bacteria--
very effective antibiotic.

01:20:11.760 --> 01:20:16.920
Also, antifolate
chemotherapies-- methotrexate,

01:20:16.920 --> 01:20:19.440
inhibitor of
dihydrofolate reductase,

01:20:19.440 --> 01:20:22.710
one of the first
chemotherapies ever discovered,

01:20:22.710 --> 01:20:27.150
also works because it
blocks thymidine synthesis

01:20:27.150 --> 01:20:30.630
by preventing your ability to
recycle the dihydrofolate back

01:20:30.630 --> 01:20:35.250
to tetrahydrofolate and carry
out thymidine synthesis.

01:20:35.250 --> 01:20:39.150
And so ends up being
a pharmacologically,

01:20:39.150 --> 01:20:42.810
at least for human medicine,
very important series

01:20:42.810 --> 01:20:45.450
of reactions.

01:20:45.450 --> 01:20:47.225
All right, so for
pyrimidine salvage,

01:20:47.225 --> 01:20:48.850
there's almost nothing
to say about it.

01:20:48.850 --> 01:20:51.690
You just take the pyrimidine
bases, and you add it to PRPP.

01:20:51.690 --> 01:20:54.900
And now you have
your pyrimidine back.

01:20:54.900 --> 01:20:57.900
And so nothing
more to say there.

01:20:57.900 --> 01:21:01.680
And really, what I want to do
is close with a few comments

01:21:01.680 --> 01:21:09.150
about regulation of nucleoside
and nucleotide metabolism.

01:21:09.150 --> 01:21:12.390
And so obviously,
if you're going

01:21:12.390 --> 01:21:17.190
to synthesize RNA
and DNA, you need

01:21:17.190 --> 01:21:22.080
to have the right
ratios of nucleotides.

01:21:22.080 --> 01:21:26.580
So if your RNA polymerase
is making an RNA molecule

01:21:26.580 --> 01:21:31.350
and it doesn't have the right
base, it can't keep going.

01:21:31.350 --> 01:21:34.830
And this is particularly
a problem for synthesis

01:21:34.830 --> 01:21:37.320
because remember, and as you
will learn or have learned

01:21:37.320 --> 01:21:39.850
in cell biology,
you have to license

01:21:39.850 --> 01:21:41.910
your origins of
replication before you

01:21:41.910 --> 01:21:44.440
start DNA replication.

01:21:44.440 --> 01:21:47.620
And that prevents you
from ever replicating

01:21:47.620 --> 01:21:50.080
the same amount of DNA
twice, meaning you say,

01:21:50.080 --> 01:21:51.100
here's where you start.

01:21:51.100 --> 01:21:53.740
And once you start, you
can't stop until you

01:21:53.740 --> 01:21:55.780
finish DNA replication.

01:21:55.780 --> 01:21:58.000
Well, this becomes
a tremendous problem

01:21:58.000 --> 01:21:59.980
if you're trying to
replicate your DNA and you

01:21:59.980 --> 01:22:02.920
run out of nucleosides
or nucleotides.

01:22:02.920 --> 01:22:06.430
And so there has to be
complex mechanisms in place

01:22:06.430 --> 01:22:09.100
to make sure that
cells always have

01:22:09.100 --> 01:22:14.440
the right levels of
nucleotide triphosphates

01:22:14.440 --> 01:22:18.970
and deoxynucleotide
triphosphates.

01:22:18.970 --> 01:22:22.060
And so there's complex
feedbacks that we

01:22:22.060 --> 01:22:24.510
could give a whole lecture on.

01:22:24.510 --> 01:22:26.860
But for the purposes
of today, I just

01:22:26.860 --> 01:22:30.250
want you to be familiar
and know that they're here.

01:22:30.250 --> 01:22:32.620
And they also all make sense.

01:22:32.620 --> 01:22:36.410
They fit exactly with what we've
talked about in other pathways.

01:22:36.410 --> 01:22:39.250
And so shown here on
the slide is the control

01:22:39.250 --> 01:22:40.940
of purine synthesis.

01:22:40.940 --> 01:22:42.800
And so this makes perfect sense.

01:22:42.800 --> 01:22:46.000
So if you have
plenty of purines,

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:49.175
meaning you have a
lot of AMP, GMP, IMP.

01:22:49.175 --> 01:22:50.050
Well, what do you do?

01:22:50.050 --> 01:22:54.220
Well, don't charge the
ribose 5-phosphate to PRPP.

01:22:54.220 --> 01:22:57.640
Or don't carry out the first
step in purine synthesis

01:22:57.640 --> 01:23:00.160
where you take that
ammonia from glutamine

01:23:00.160 --> 01:23:05.350
and take PRPP and add it to the
PRPP to begin purine synthesis.

01:23:05.350 --> 01:23:08.680
And so all of these
purine monophosphates

01:23:08.680 --> 01:23:13.570
inhibit this early steps of
purine synthesis, makes sense.

01:23:13.570 --> 01:23:17.200
What if you have an imbalance
in your AMP and GMP pools?

01:23:17.200 --> 01:23:19.330
Well, the way you
prevent that, remember,

01:23:19.330 --> 01:23:22.330
we already discussed that
to turn IMP into AMP,

01:23:22.330 --> 01:23:27.460
you use GTP as an
energy phosphate donor.

01:23:27.460 --> 01:23:32.450
And to turn IMP into GMP, you
use ATP as an energy phosphate

01:23:32.450 --> 01:23:32.950
donor.

01:23:32.950 --> 01:23:35.980
So that's one way
you regulate this.

01:23:35.980 --> 01:23:38.560
But the other thing is if
you have enough AMP, well,

01:23:38.560 --> 01:23:39.940
don't try to make AMP.

01:23:39.940 --> 01:23:42.880
And if you have enough
GMP, don't try to make GMP.

01:23:42.880 --> 01:23:45.070
And so there's
feedbacks there as well

01:23:45.070 --> 01:23:49.650
that add to balancing
the AMP and GMP pools.

01:23:49.650 --> 01:23:50.850
What about pyrimidines?

01:23:50.850 --> 01:23:56.400
Well, pyrimidines-- simpler
synthesis, simpler regulation.

01:23:56.400 --> 01:24:00.210
If you have enough
pyrimidines, enough CTP,

01:24:00.210 --> 01:24:02.430
don't do the first
step where you

01:24:02.430 --> 01:24:05.100
take aspartate and
carbamoyl phosphate

01:24:05.100 --> 01:24:13.480
and generate that first step
here in pyrimidine synthesis.

01:24:13.480 --> 01:24:16.600
dNTPs, obviously, as I said,
is particularly critical

01:24:16.600 --> 01:24:19.080
because once you start
replicating your DNA,

01:24:19.080 --> 01:24:21.100
you always have to
have the right balance

01:24:21.100 --> 01:24:23.290
of deoxyribonucleotides.

01:24:23.290 --> 01:24:26.350
And so ribonucleotide
reductase, that

01:24:26.350 --> 01:24:31.540
enzyme up there that basically
balances and synthesizes

01:24:31.540 --> 01:24:36.520
your deoxyribonucleotides, it
has incredibly complex feedback

01:24:36.520 --> 01:24:40.150
mechanisms that one could spend
a whole lecture talking about.

01:24:40.150 --> 01:24:43.270
But effectively, it has
various feedback mechanisms

01:24:43.270 --> 01:24:46.690
with allosteric sites and
other feedbacks that are still,

01:24:46.690 --> 01:24:50.590
honestly, being worked
out, that, in the end,

01:24:50.590 --> 01:24:52.720
is a way that helps
you balance to make

01:24:52.720 --> 01:24:54.550
sure you have the
right levels of all

01:24:54.550 --> 01:24:57.370
the different
deoxyribonucleotides

01:24:57.370 --> 01:24:59.260
in the end.

01:24:59.260 --> 01:25:04.480
All right, if you're interested
more in the feedbacks

01:25:04.480 --> 01:25:06.520
of ribonucleotide
reductase, these

01:25:06.520 --> 01:25:09.440
are covered well
in your textbook.

01:25:09.440 --> 01:25:12.400
Any of the topics that
we didn't have time

01:25:12.400 --> 01:25:17.080
to cover that might become
relevant for your future

01:25:17.080 --> 01:25:22.000
endeavors in biology,
medicine, metabolism, whatever,

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:23.740
all of those are well covered.

01:25:23.740 --> 01:25:28.120
And hopefully, if you could
absorb some of the concepts

01:25:28.120 --> 01:25:32.800
that I tried to impart to you
about how metabolism works,

01:25:32.800 --> 01:25:36.050
you can understand
those pathways better.

01:25:36.050 --> 01:25:39.070
Hope you enjoyed 7.05.

01:25:39.070 --> 01:25:42.640
Hope you enjoyed learning
about metabolism.

01:25:42.640 --> 01:25:46.350
And thank you very much
for your attention.

WEBVTT

00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:02.920
PROFESSOR: All right,
so how do we solve this?

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:05.380
This is a very
interesting thing,

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:14.230
and I think it points to all
kinds of important things

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:18.620
that people find
useful in physics.

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:24.160
So here it is, the way,
maybe, we can think about it.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.080
Think variational method.

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.410
What is the variational method?

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:32.950
You write a wave
function and you

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:37.030
try to see what
is the expectation

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.430
value of the Hamiltonian
and that wave function.

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.250
You calculate it, and now you
know that the ground state

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.890
energy is below that number.

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.320
Because for the
real ground state

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.210
expectation value
of the Hamiltonian

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:50.590
is the ground state energy.

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:53.990
For an arbitrary state
it's more than that.

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:57.190
So the variational
method says, OK,

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.820
if you want to figure
out what is a good wave

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.590
function, compute the
expectation value of your wave

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:11.160
function in the Hamiltonian,
and then you will see,

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.600
you will get some energy.

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.430
If you tinker with
your wave function

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.500
you can get to the right energy.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.320
So this is what
we're going to do

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:27.720
we're going to try to
take this psi of r, r

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.330
and put the total
Hamiltonian here.

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.110
And now that psi of r, r is
going to be this one from now

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.550
on.

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:37.832
This is psi of r, r.

00:01:37.832 --> 00:01:44.715
We'll put it here, and then
I'll put another psi of r, r.

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.320
And I have to compute that.

00:01:54.320 --> 00:02:00.790
But think of it-- it's actually
pretty nice, the situation.

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:03.970
Computing this, you
could say how can I

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:09.639
compute that if I don't know
the etas, the single eta that

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:10.210
is there?

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:13.750
I know the Hamiltonian
but I don't know the eta,

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.900
so I can't compute this.

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.580
But think of this really, this
is an integral, because there's

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.790
an [INAUDIBLE] over
all the capital R's,

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.610
an integral over the little
r's, and you can say,

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:34.140
oh, I know the little r's here.

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.700
I know them very well.

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:36.720
I found them.

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.220
I found this phi r.

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:40.530
I've determined it.

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.470
Some way you did.

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.690
So if I know that, I know
the little r dependence,

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:53.840
and I can do all the
little r integrals.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.770
If I can do all the
little r integrals,

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:01.700
means that this wave
function is a product,

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.280
this wave function
is a product, this

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.800
I can reduce to the following.

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:16.470
Eta of r, because this one I
don't know, and then eta of r,

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.010
and I claim that
all the part that

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:23.060
had to do with the phi
of r, we can take care,

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.920
and then there's going to be
some Hamiltonian here left.

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:33.760
And this we're going to
call h effective of the r

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:34.810
degrees of freedom.

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:45.530
So a lot of physics
in that step.

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:50.630
Seems like we did
nothing, but look,

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:55.790
I'm supposed to minimize this
by adjusting my trial wave

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:57.320
functions.

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:00.380
OK, but I don't have
room to adjust the phi,

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:03.050
because I determined
that it's a good one.

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:06.180
So I put it in and
I calculate this.

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.490
Now I have to minimize this.

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:15.030
But if I have to minimize
this for just v nuclear wave

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:19.850
function, I have found
the effective Hamiltonian

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:29.380
for the nuclei, in which
the electron has essentially

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:32.020
disappeared from
this interaction.

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:36.130
It just doesn't
play a role anymore.

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:38.890
This is the idea of
effective Hamiltonians

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:42.520
for slow degrees of
freedom when you integrate

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.320
fast degrees of freedom.

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.550
The fast degrees of
freedom are your electrons.

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:49.720
We're getting rid of them,
we're integrating them.

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.760
We're going to try to do that.

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:56.290
So this will be an
effective Hamiltonian

00:04:56.290 --> 00:05:00.830
for the nuclear
degrees of freedom.

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:03.600
So let me do one term in here.

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:08.500
One term, you can play
trying to do other terms,

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:12.550
and the notes will
deal with that.

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:17.470
So let's consider the term He.

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:24.790
This Hamiltonian is
some terms plus He.

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:26.750
It's over there.

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:31.000
So let's calculate what He does.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:38.350
So I now have to
put effect of He.

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:41.940
So I have to put here eta of r--

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:44.050
so let me put the whole thing.

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:48.550
It's integral over all the R's--

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:53.065
R1, R2, R3-- integral
over all the little r's.

00:05:53.065 --> 00:05:53.815
That's an overlap.

00:05:56.390 --> 00:06:02.620
Eta star of all the R's--
that's the [INAUDIBLE],,

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:24.310
phi star R of little r, He, then
etas of capital R, phi R of r.

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:28.540
Everybody happy?

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:32.180
That's my term.

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:36.710
That's the contribution of
He to the left hand side.

00:06:44.534 --> 00:06:47.470
Good?

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:54.410
Now He is an operator and
looks at this thing and says,

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:59.920
well, I don't think derivatives
with respect to capital R,

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:01.810
so I'm there.

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:04.300
I take the derivatives
with respect to little r,

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:07.780
I have a multiplicative factor,
another multiplicative factor.

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:12.700
So I basically act
just directly on this.

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:18.100
But He already acting
on that gives you

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:20.120
the electronic energy.

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:28.030
So this would be the electronic
energy in the ground state.

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:36.760
That depends on R times
phi R. And lots of vectors.

00:07:43.001 --> 00:07:43.500
OK.

00:07:52.750 --> 00:08:07.920
So this integral now becomes
integral dR eta star of R.

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:14.880
Then I'll put the other
integral, integral dr, phi

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:19.950
of r, star of r.

00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:44.750
And then I have just this
number times eta of R.

00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:47.210
All right, so what
is this integral?

00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:49.650
Happily, this is just a number.

00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:52.980
It goes out of this, it's
an orthonormal state.

00:08:52.980 --> 00:09:10.440
So this whole thing is dR eta
star of R, Ee of R, eta of R,

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:21.020
which you could say is eta of
R, the number Ee of R times

00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:27.140
eta of R, and therefore
you've confirmed

00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:32.360
that the contribution to the
effective Hamiltonian of all

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:40.520
this electron cloud is just this
number, the electronic energy

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:41.030
like that.

00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:46.190
So in the effective
Hamiltonian, h effective,

00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:49.130
there will be some
terms and there will

00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:56.750
be Ee of R. That's one term.

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:09.070
OK, so what is the whole answer
for the effective Hamiltonian?

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:16.840
No way to guess it, I
think, unless you're--

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:19.330
well, you have
incredible intuition.

00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:26.500
It's going to be a
little complicated.

00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:29.280
If you think about it, why?

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:34.800
Suppose this term is going to
create no trouble whatsoever.

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:36.840
It's just going to copy itself.

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:40.470
This thing doesn't act on
the electronic wave function,

00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:42.600
so the electronic wave
function's going to cancel,

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:45.210
is just going to
contribute by itself.

00:10:45.210 --> 00:10:47.670
So this term we've done.

00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:50.240
This term is easy.

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:52.950
It just gives itself.

00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:59.460
But this term is tough, because
this term takes derivatives

00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:04.410
with respect to capital
R, and your wave function

00:11:04.410 --> 00:11:12.370
depends on capital R. So
it's going to be interesting.

00:11:12.370 --> 00:11:13.920
So what is the answer?

00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:18.660
I want to give you
the answer rather than

00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:19.910
do that calculation.

00:11:22.570 --> 00:11:29.670
And it's almost like
sometimes physics

00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:35.130
seems to have just a
limited bag of tricks,

00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:41.980
and things come out in some
way or another in a simple way.

00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:46.410
So what is the
effective Hamiltonian?

00:11:46.410 --> 00:11:50.580
You could say, OK, it's going
to be the sum of kinetic terms,

00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:58.680
2m alpha over alpha, and
you have p alpha squared.

00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:01.420
Well, it's not going to
be just p alpha squared.

00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:03.090
There's going to
be a little more.

00:12:03.090 --> 00:12:07.020
And then there's going to be
a potential, a great potential

00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:12.840
of R, and that
great potential of R

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:17.720
is going to include the
nuclear nuclear R potential.

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:22.290
We said that this nuclear
nuclear term would just

00:12:22.290 --> 00:12:23.820
copy along.

00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:30.960
The He we calculated, and
that gives us the Ee of R.

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:32.640
And you say, well,
maybe that's it,

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:35.500
but no, it's not
that, that's it.

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:38.520
So let's see what it gives you.

00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:42.730
OK, so here it comes.

00:12:42.730 --> 00:12:45.100
You remember
electromagnetism, you

00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:46.990
could change this thing here?

00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:56.350
Well, it gets changed, and it
will become p minus a alpha.

00:12:56.350 --> 00:12:59.740
Like if there would
be a connection.

00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:02.360
Like if there would be
an electromagnetic field.

00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:06.510
There's no electromagnetic
field here, nothing whatsoever.

00:13:06.510 --> 00:13:10.390
But there is one
thing, and what is it?

00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:16.330
As we'll write here, it turns
out to be a Berry connection.

00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:18.430
Because you have
the adiabatic thing

00:13:18.430 --> 00:13:20.770
and you have your
states that depend on R,

00:13:20.770 --> 00:13:23.380
the Berry connection shows up.

00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:27.730
So it shows up like this here.

00:13:27.730 --> 00:13:33.010
And here it shows up in
a couple of funny terms.

00:13:33.010 --> 00:13:37.630
A term of the form
alpha h squared over

00:13:37.630 --> 00:13:45.970
2m alpha, integral
vr, gradient sub r

00:13:45.970 --> 00:13:56.470
alpha of phi r squared,
minus sum over alpha

00:13:56.470 --> 00:14:01.645
a alpha squared over 2m alpha.

00:14:04.250 --> 00:14:09.160
So that's the whole thing,
but I haven't defined the a.

00:14:19.492 --> 00:14:20.970
What is the a?

00:14:20.970 --> 00:14:24.060
Well, it's sort of
a Berry connection.

00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:26.430
So you know what a
Berry connection is.

00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:31.290
It's a v with a R in
configuration space of a wave

00:14:31.290 --> 00:14:37.560
function with the star
wave function, integrated.

00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:39.660
That was kind of a
Berry connection.

00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:42.716
So it turns out to
be very similar here.

00:14:42.716 --> 00:14:51.180
The a alpha vector
of R is ih bar,

00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:55.710
the integral over the little
space-- the electron space.

00:14:55.710 --> 00:14:58.170
That's where you
integrate things--

00:14:58.170 --> 00:15:02.550
of the electric wave
function star times

00:15:02.550 --> 00:15:08.850
the gradient with respect to
R alpha of the electron wave

00:15:08.850 --> 00:15:14.130
function of R.

00:15:14.130 --> 00:15:16.290
That is the Berry connection.

00:15:16.290 --> 00:15:21.080
If you remember, it's an overlap
of wave function, wave function

00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:26.860
and the gradient with respect
to the configuration space.

00:15:26.860 --> 00:15:36.690
So that's a good
Hamiltonian for a molecule

00:15:36.690 --> 00:15:38.750
in the adiabatic approximation.

00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:41.230
If this looks
complicated, it's already

00:15:41.230 --> 00:15:45.670
much simpler than what the
real problem is, because

00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:47.650
of the adiabatic approximation.

00:15:47.650 --> 00:15:50.920
If you have these
wave functions,

00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:56.800
these electronic wave functions
you can calculate these a's.

00:15:56.800 --> 00:16:01.180
And this plays the role of
the effective Hamiltonian

00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:06.180
for the nuclei in
this approximation.

00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:09.750
So the variational principle
essentially told us

00:16:09.750 --> 00:16:15.150
what is the right
way to describe

00:16:15.150 --> 00:16:20.640
the interactions of the nuclei,
given that the electrons have

00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:27.210
already been fixed into a
class of wave functions.

00:16:27.210 --> 00:16:32.940
Now in general, this is
the complete solution,

00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:40.050
but in general it's hard to
do it, still complicated.

00:16:40.050 --> 00:16:43.280
So many times, people simplify.

00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:45.460
Well, it might
happen, for example,

00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:49.420
if you have a simple enough
molecule that your wave

00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:54.120
functions phi r are real.

00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:57.510
Now you remember that the
Berry phase vanishes when

00:16:57.510 --> 00:16:59.490
the wave functions are real.

00:16:59.490 --> 00:17:02.250
These things have
to be imaginary.

00:17:02.250 --> 00:17:04.890
With another i they
have to be real.

00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:13.310
Connections are always real
operators in the sense of r.

00:17:13.310 --> 00:17:17.970
So if the electronic wave
functions are real, forget it,

00:17:17.970 --> 00:17:20.550
there's no Berry connection.

00:17:20.550 --> 00:17:24.510
So many times the Berry
connections are not there.

00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:26.970
Even if there are no
Berry connections,

00:17:26.970 --> 00:17:30.310
this term might be there.

00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:33.300
This is the gradient of this
wave function with respect

00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:37.470
to the R. And this
term can be important,

00:17:37.470 --> 00:17:41.290
even if there is no
Berry connection.

00:17:41.290 --> 00:17:54.380
So in some cases, the lowest
order approximation of this--

00:17:54.380 --> 00:17:56.580
I think that's what
this classically called

00:17:56.580 --> 00:17:59.320
the [INAUDIBLE] Oppenheimer--

00:18:02.830 --> 00:18:09.770
ignores the Berry phase and
ignores this extra term.

00:18:09.770 --> 00:18:14.500
So in that approximation, the
lowest order approximation,

00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:18.310
the effective
Hamiltonian, is just

00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:22.090
the sum over alpha
minus h squared

00:18:22.090 --> 00:18:30.240
over 2m alpha, Laplacian R
alpha plus the nuclear nuclear

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:37.420
potential, plus the electronic
contribution to the potential.

00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:43.240
So you keep-- basically,
forget about Berry.

00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:48.040
That's higher approximation,
higher order approximation,

00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:49.690
higher order approximation.

00:18:49.690 --> 00:18:53.690
Keep just the p, keep
the nuclear nuclear,

00:18:53.690 --> 00:18:55.960
keep the electronic.

00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:59.720
And people have done
a lot with this.

00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:07.220
So that's how our
treatment of molecules.

00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:10.060
A pretty interesting thing.

00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:13.330
And perhaps the most important
lesson of all of this

00:19:13.330 --> 00:19:20.470
is your way in which you can
see how light degrees of freedom

00:19:20.470 --> 00:19:24.040
impose dynamics in slow
degrees of freedom.

00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:27.460
And that's something you do
in physics, in quantum field

00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:29.290
theory, all the time.

00:19:29.290 --> 00:19:33.880
You have the slow-moving
degrees of freedom

00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:35.630
and the fast-moving
degrees of freedom.

00:19:35.630 --> 00:19:38.530
And you integrate the
fast-moving degrees of freedom,

00:19:38.530 --> 00:19:43.180
and you find an effective
Hamiltonian for the big things.

00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:46.700
You may have quarks and all
kinds of complicated things.

00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:50.020
But at the end of the day,
they form protons and neutrons,

00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:53.230
and you can integrate the
interactions of the quarks

00:19:53.230 --> 00:19:57.860
to sort of find the dynamics of
the particle that you observe.

00:19:57.860 --> 00:20:02.740
So that step in that top
blackboard is pretty important.

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:14.370
JONATHAN GRUBER:
All right, so we

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.080
finished the first unit of the
course, or consumer theory,

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.672
and we've sort of gotten
to the demand curve.

00:00:21.672 --> 00:00:23.880
Now we move onto the second
year of the course, which

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.547
is producer theory,
and talk about where

00:00:25.547 --> 00:00:27.330
the supply curve comes from.

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.840
Now the good news is that a
lot of the tools and skills we

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.947
developed in the
first few lectures

00:00:32.947 --> 00:00:35.280
will translate quite nicely
to thinking about the supply

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.170
curve and production.

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.177
The bad news is,
supply is a lot harder.

00:00:39.177 --> 00:00:41.560
It's a lot harder,
fundamentally,

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:46.140
the big picture, because
we did consumer theory.

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.420
We sort of told you
what your income was.

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.880
We told you income and
prices, and then we said,

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.400
OK, here's how to optimize.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.900
With firms, they sort of get
to decide what their income is.

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.630
They get to decide
how much they produce,

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:59.130
and that means we're going to
need an extra whole constraint

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:01.520
we're going need to
model, an extra other part

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:02.840
of the process.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.190
So it's going to be an extra
step with producer theory,

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.270
but a lot of the tools
will be the same.

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:08.730
So let's dive in.

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:11.010
We're going to start
by talking about,

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.610
just as consumers have
a utility function,

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.175
producers have a
production function.

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:25.730
So the first parallel
is that producers

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:27.430
have production function.

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:32.370
Now here, their goal is
not to maximize production.

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:34.900
Their goal is to
maximize profits.

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.770
So as consumers want
to maximize utility,

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.260
producers want to
maximize profits, which

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.630
equals revenues minus costs.

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.290
So the goal of a producer is
to maximize profits, which

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.530
equals revenues minus costs.

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.360
And what that's
going to mean, it's

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:01.020
going to mean producing goods
as efficiently as possible,

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.110
maximizing your profits.

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.150
We are going to focus for the
first few lectures on the cost

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:07.020
part.

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.530
In particular, we're going to
focus on maximizing profits

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.630
through minimizing costs.

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.210
And we minimize
costs by producing

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:18.000
as efficiently as possible, OK.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.280
And that's what we'll focus
on in the next few lectures.

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.800
Now, what firms
can produce comes

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.170
from their production function.

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.100
A production function is
of the general form q--

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.425
that's units of goods produced--

00:02:33.425 --> 00:02:37.700
is a function of the amount
of labor input and capital

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.360
input used by the
firm, so q, little q--

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.130
let me just
highlight right here.

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:44.510
I will hopefully get this right.

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.718
I never in the semester have
gotten it totally right.

00:02:46.718 --> 00:02:48.650
Little q refers to a firm.

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.952
Big Q refers to a market, OK.

00:02:50.952 --> 00:02:52.660
We're going to try to
keep this straight.

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.920
So little q means a firm's
production function.

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.830
Big Q means a market
production function, OK.

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:00.550
So if I get that wrong, I'm
sure you guys will tell me.

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:05.030
OK, so basically what a
production function does

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:11.570
is it converts inputs, which are
labor and capital, into output

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:15.590
through some function, just like
utility function converts goods

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.750
into happiness
through some function.

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.310
It's the same idea here, but
here, it's more tangible.

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:25.140
Unlike utils, output can
actually be measured.

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.980
So literally, it's not
some preference mapping.

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.132
It's literally a
technological function.

00:03:32.132 --> 00:03:34.715
OK, you get your hands around
it more than a utility function.

00:03:34.715 --> 00:03:38.090
It's literally a technologial
function by which inputs

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.820
get converted to an output.

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:48.330
Now, we call these inputs the
factors of production, OK.

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:51.530
Labor and capital, we call
the factors of production.

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.570
They're the inputs they
get used to produce things.

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:56.350
Now, what are labor and capital?

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:57.630
Labor is pretty easy.

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.630
Labor is workers,
OK, either number

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:02.120
of workers or hours of work.

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.350
we'll use those interchangeably,
but the bottom line

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:05.340
is, labor is workers.

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:06.460
It's you all.

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:09.130
OK, that's sort
of the easy part.

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:10.720
Capital is harder.

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.130
Capital is machines
land, building,

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:19.519
all the stuff that workers
use to make things, OK.

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:21.500
So capital's a vaguer concept.

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.740
But for now, think of it as
like machines and buildings,

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:32.260
OK, the stuff that workers
use to produce goods.

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:37.620
And outputs are the goods and
services that got produced.

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:41.200
Now, when we talk about inputs
or factors of production,

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:46.640
we're going to talk about
them being variable or fixed.

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:55.140
Variable means changeable,
fixed means not changeable, OK.

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:58.320
So variable inputs are inputs
that can be easily changed,

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.180
like hours of work.

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:01.175
You can easily work.

00:05:01.175 --> 00:05:03.300
You guys work different
amounts of hours every day.

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:05.460
You can easily change
the hours that you work.

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:07.960
You can pull an all nighter if
something's due the next day.

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:12.030
You can work less if there's
something good on TV, OK.

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:14.640
Fixed inputs are those which
are harder to change quickly,

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:16.405
like the size of a plant.

00:05:16.405 --> 00:05:18.030
Let's say you're
siding a bigger plant.

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:20.730
You can't just
instantly do that.

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:22.440
It takes a lot of
production process.

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:24.533
You can see by the giant
production going on

00:05:24.533 --> 00:05:25.950
as you pass every
day as you walk,

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:29.220
if you come from east campus,
you walk to this building,

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:31.560
it's going to take years
to build out those new MIT

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.330
facilities, OK.

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:34.650
So it's not simple.

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:37.885
So fixed inputs are inputs that
are hard to change quickly.

00:05:37.885 --> 00:05:39.260
And the key
distinction we draw--

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:40.770
and we think about
variable fixed--

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:46.050
is the short run
versus the long run.

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:50.520
And the way we define
these is that basically,

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:54.490
in the short run,
some inputs are fixed

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:56.140
and some are variable.

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:58.320
In particular, we're going
to stay in the short run,

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:01.900
labor is variable
and capital is fixed.

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:06.310
So in the short run, you have
labor and then some fixed level

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:09.073
of capital, k bar.

00:06:09.073 --> 00:06:10.990
So in the short run,
you've got some building.

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:12.615
You can't change it,
but you can always

00:06:12.615 --> 00:06:15.580
change how hard people
work in that building.

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:18.300
In long run
everything's variable.

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:21.670
Labor and capital are
both variable, OK,

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:22.762
so there's no k bar.

00:06:22.762 --> 00:06:24.220
Capital's variable
in the long run.

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:32.480
So the question then is, what
is the short and the long run.

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:35.480
Well, there's no
good answer to that.

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:36.980
Intuitively, think
of the short run

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:40.190
as a matter of days or weeks
or months and the long run

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:44.710
as a matter of years or
decades, for your own intuition.

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:47.140
But technically,
the definition is,

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:50.020
the long one is the
period of time over which

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:52.740
all inputs are variable.

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:54.150
That's the technical definition.

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:56.490
The long run is a period
of time over which

00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:57.827
all inputs are variable.

00:06:57.827 --> 00:06:59.160
That's our technical definition.

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:01.202
So think about how long
it takes to build a plant

00:07:01.202 --> 00:07:03.330
or make new machines, OK.

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:04.372
That's the long run.

00:07:04.372 --> 00:07:06.330
So I'm never going to
ask you, is the short run

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:08.880
8.3 days or 9.7 days, OK.

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:10.395
There's no right answer.

00:07:10.395 --> 00:07:12.270
The right answer is,
the technical answer is,

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:14.770
the short run is a period of
time over which some inputs are

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:16.428
fixed and some are variable.

00:07:16.428 --> 00:07:18.220
The long run is the
period of time in which

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:20.770
all inputs are variable, OK.

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:22.740
And it's not a
clean distinction.

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:25.180
Obviously, in reality,
there's a whole range

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:29.110
of inputs ranging from
workers to the gas you pipe in

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:31.870
to use for your thing, to the
raw materials you have to buy

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:33.610
to the machines, the buildings.

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:36.580
Obviously, in reality, there's
a whole range of variability.

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:38.080
But once again, to
make life easier,

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:41.200
we're going to shrink this
down to two dimensions, labor

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:42.280
and capital.

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:43.960
Labor is going to
always be variable.

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:46.210
Capital's going to be fixed
in the short run, variable

00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:47.910
in the long run, OK.

00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:50.542
So that's how we'll boil
this down to make life easy.

00:07:50.542 --> 00:07:51.097
Yeah.

00:07:51.097 --> 00:07:52.472
AUDIENCE: Can you
give an example

00:07:52.472 --> 00:07:53.514
of what capital is again?

00:07:55.515 --> 00:07:58.320
JONATHAN GRUBER: Capital is the
buildings, machines, the stuff

00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:02.105
that workers use to make things.

00:08:02.105 --> 00:08:04.860
Yeah, OK.

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:07.180
Other questions?

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:10.540
With these definitions
in mind, let's talk

00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:12.880
about short run production.

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:15.640
Let's start by talking about
production in the short run.

00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:22.270
Someone needs to invent me
some more indestructible chalk.

00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:29.530
OK, so let's start in the
short run where labor is

00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:31.160
variable and capital's fixed.

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:33.610
So in the short run
production function,

00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:39.640
q equals f of L and k bar, OK.

00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:42.780
That's our short run
production function.

00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:48.190
OK, now that means in the short
run, the firm's only decision,

00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:49.780
the firm is given
a stock of capital.

00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:52.060
So think of the
short run as, you

00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:54.587
are hired to manage a plant.

00:08:54.587 --> 00:08:56.170
And the plant, you
don't get to decide

00:08:56.170 --> 00:08:58.080
if the plant's big or
small or what machines.

00:08:58.080 --> 00:08:59.050
It's there.

00:08:59.050 --> 00:09:01.633
Your only decision is
how many workers to hire,

00:09:01.633 --> 00:09:03.050
how many hours of
labor to employ.

00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:04.633
And once again, I'll
go back and forth

00:09:04.633 --> 00:09:06.760
through a number of
workers and hours of labor.

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:12.070
The bottom line is the amount
of labor being provided, OK.

00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:14.230
The way you're going
to decide that is,

00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:15.900
you are going to
look at when we're

00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:21.730
going to call the
marginal product of labor,

00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:25.630
the marginal product of
labor, which is simply

00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:31.240
the change in output for the
next unit of labor input.

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:33.417
This is very much like a
marginal utility of a good.

00:09:33.417 --> 00:09:35.750
Once again, going back to our
powerless consumer theory,

00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:38.290
the marginal
utility of pizza was

00:09:38.290 --> 00:09:41.200
the delta in utility for
the next unit of pizza.

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:44.110
The marginal product
of labor is the delta

00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:49.140
in the amount produced for
the next unit of labor.

00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:52.320
And we are going to assume,
much as we assume diminishing

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:54.990
marginal utility, we
are going to assume

00:09:54.990 --> 00:10:01.430
diminishing marginal product.

00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:03.040
Now, that's a little
less intuitive

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:04.340
than diminishing
marginal utility was.

00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:06.632
At least, I hope you found
diminishing marginal utility

00:10:06.632 --> 00:10:09.080
kind of intuitive, that
the second slice of pizza

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:11.750
would be worth less to you
than the first slice of pizza.

00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:14.180
Hope you found
that intuitive, OK.

00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:15.710
Now, this is less intuitive.

00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:17.570
Once again, like
with utility, it's

00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:20.300
not saying the next
worker doesn't help.

00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:21.590
The next worker does help.

00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:23.870
It's just that the
next worker helps less

00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:27.290
than the previous worker, OK.

00:10:27.290 --> 00:10:29.660
Now, this isn't true everywhere.

00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:32.360
Obviously, there are tasks
where having two workers

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:35.930
together makes both better, and
we'll talk about that later on.

00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:39.050
But we're going to focus
on the range of production

00:10:39.050 --> 00:10:40.590
where this is true.

00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:43.880
Think about production functions
as being non-monotonic,

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:44.880
they can go up and down.

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:47.005
But we're going to focus
on the range of production

00:10:47.005 --> 00:10:49.370
where this is true, where
the next worker is not

00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:52.760
as productive, OK, because
eventually that's going

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:55.080
to be true for every firm.

00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:56.970
And why is that
going to be true?

00:10:56.970 --> 00:10:59.900
Because we're holding
capital fixed.

00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:02.150
The reason eventually workers
will get less productive

00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:04.483
is because there are only so
many machines and buildings

00:11:04.483 --> 00:11:06.740
they can work in.

00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:08.690
The classic example we
think is the example

00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:12.140
of digging a hole
with one shovel.

00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:14.750
You've got one worker
digging a hole.

00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:16.790
She can do a certain
amount of effort.

00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:18.920
Then a second
worker comes along.

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:19.728
She can add value.

00:11:19.728 --> 00:11:20.520
The first can rest.

00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:21.978
They can trade off,
and maybe she's

00:11:21.978 --> 00:11:24.275
almost as productive,
or probably not quite.

00:11:24.275 --> 00:11:26.150
Then the third worker,
and the fourth worker.

00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:27.410
By time you have
six workers, they're

00:11:27.410 --> 00:11:29.202
mostly just standing
around because there's

00:11:29.202 --> 00:11:30.407
only one shovel.

00:11:30.407 --> 00:11:32.240
Now, each one's more
productive because they

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:35.080
can help you optimize the
shift and get rest and stuff,

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:37.580
but the truth is, clearly the
sixth worker's less productive

00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:40.600
the fifth worker given
there's only one shovel.

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:44.320
So the key to understanding
the intuition of diminishing

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:46.073
Marshall practice to
remember that there's

00:11:46.073 --> 00:11:47.240
a limited amount of capital.

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:49.190
There is a fixed
amount of capital.

00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:51.760
So if there's a given building
and you've got 1,000 workers

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:53.510
and you try to shove
the 1,001st in there,

00:11:53.510 --> 00:11:55.760
he's not going to do a
whole lot of good, OK.

00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:58.900
So marginal product of
labor comes from the notion

00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:00.610
that there's a fixed
amount of capital,

00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:03.460
so each additional worker
does less and less,

00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:06.310
adds less and less to
the production, OK.

00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:08.197
That's the intuition
for diminishing

00:12:08.197 --> 00:12:09.280
marginal product of labor.

00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:14.000
And that's pretty much it
for short run production.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.120
That's sort of what
you've got to know.

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:19.400
The more interesting
action comes when

00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:21.811
we go to long run production.

00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:27.810
That gets more interesting
because now, you

00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:31.635
have an optimization decision
over labor versus capital.

00:12:31.635 --> 00:12:33.010
In the short run,
you just decide

00:12:33.010 --> 00:12:34.570
how many workers to hire.

00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:36.640
In the long run, now
you're back to the kind

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:38.440
of utility framework we used.

00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:40.360
We had to trade off
pizza and cookies.

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:43.120
Now, you get to trade
off workers and machines.

00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:44.430
Now you own the firm.

00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:48.700
You're going to own it forever,
OK, and you get to trade off.

00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:53.520
You get to think about
workers versus machines.

00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:57.780
So now, you're going to have
to make a decision on that.

00:12:57.780 --> 00:13:00.000
And that decision
is going to be,

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.760
just as your decision of how
to trade off cookies and pizza

00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:06.060
is driven by utility
function, your decision

00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:08.820
about whether to employ workers
or machines it's being driven

00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:10.930
by your production function.

00:13:10.930 --> 00:13:12.190
So make life easy.

00:13:12.190 --> 00:13:13.950
Let's start a
production function that

00:13:13.950 --> 00:13:16.770
looks just like the utility
function we're using, q

00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:19.100
equals L times k.

00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:20.412
Familiar form.

00:13:20.412 --> 00:13:22.620
Before, we said how happy
pizza and cookies made you.

00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:24.680
It was the square root
of pizza times cookies.

00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:27.340
Now we're going to say how
many goods you can produce

00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:30.130
is the square root of
capital times labor.

00:13:30.130 --> 00:13:37.470
OK, and figure 5-1 shows
you what that delivers

00:13:37.470 --> 00:13:39.750
in terms of graphically.

00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:42.900
Just as to graphically
represent utility,

00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:47.700
we graft indifference curves,
to graphically represent

00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:51.300
production, we are going
to graph isoquants.

00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:57.670
Isoquants are like firm
indifference curves,

00:13:57.670 --> 00:14:00.003
but once again, they're
sort of more tangible.

00:14:00.003 --> 00:14:02.170
An indifference curve is
this weird, intangible idea

00:14:02.170 --> 00:14:04.140
of points along which
are indifferent.

00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:05.740
And isoquant's a tangible thing.

00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:08.110
It's the combinations
of capital and labor

00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:11.100
that produce the same
amount of output, OK.

00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:13.790
So for any given
production function,

00:14:13.790 --> 00:14:16.100
there's different combination
of capital and labor

00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:18.690
that produce the same
amount of output.

00:14:18.690 --> 00:14:25.010
So for example, in our
example, two units of capital

00:14:25.010 --> 00:14:29.300
and two units of labor
produces two units of output.

00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:31.520
Four units of capital
and one unit labor

00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:33.255
also produced two
units of output,

00:14:33.255 --> 00:14:36.670
so they would be on
the same isoquant.

00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:39.190
They're this combinations
of inputs that deliver

00:14:39.190 --> 00:14:42.900
the same level of output, OK.

00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:45.680
And isoquants, all the stuff
we learned about indifference

00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:47.530
curves apply here.

00:14:47.530 --> 00:14:50.120
More is better, so
further out is better.

00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:53.210
They can't cross, OK.

00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:55.192
And they slope downwards.

00:14:55.192 --> 00:14:57.650
All the set of things we learned
about indifference curves,

00:14:57.650 --> 00:15:01.790
that same set of
intuitions applies here.

00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:04.930
The difference
with production is

00:15:04.930 --> 00:15:08.980
it's more plausible to
have extreme cases, OK.

00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:10.940
So let's consider
two extreme cases.

00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:12.680
Let's first consider
the case of inputs

00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:15.080
that are perfectly
substitutable, so

00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:18.680
like a Harvard graduate
and a Beanie Baby, OK,

00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:22.070
perfectly substitutable inputs.

00:15:22.070 --> 00:15:25.370
Those are goods where the
production function would be

00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:30.920
of the form, q equals L plus k.

00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:36.610
That's perfectly
substitute because you're

00:15:36.610 --> 00:15:38.860
indifferent between the unit
value and the unit value.

00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:40.380
They're perfectly substitutable.

00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:43.780
So you can see that
in figure 5-2a,

00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:47.510
I do x and y instead of L and
k, but it's the same idea.

00:15:47.510 --> 00:15:51.920
If there's two inputs, x and
y, then with that production

00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:53.420
function, a perfectly
substitutable,

00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:57.630
that would lead to
linear isoquants.

00:15:57.630 --> 00:16:01.550
Perfectly substitutable inputs
will lead to linear isoqaunts

00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:04.230
with a slope of minus
1, you're perfectly

00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:08.370
indfiferent between one or
the other at all levels.

00:16:08.370 --> 00:16:10.673
At any point in time, you're
indifferent between 1 more

00:16:10.673 --> 00:16:12.840
unit of x and 1 more unit
of y, 1 more unit of labor

00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:16.220
and 1 unit of capital, OK.

00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:21.410
At the other extreme would be
perfectly non-substitutable

00:16:21.410 --> 00:16:28.910
inputs, inputs where you
can't produce one more unit

00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:32.510
without one of each input, OK.

00:16:32.510 --> 00:16:35.690
That would look
like figure 5-2b.

00:16:35.690 --> 00:16:39.260
We call this a Leontieff
production function.

00:16:42.990 --> 00:16:45.300
A Leontieff
production function is

00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:49.350
one where there's
non-substitutable inputs, where

00:16:49.350 --> 00:16:53.010
the production function
is the min of x and y,

00:16:53.010 --> 00:16:55.560
that one more unit
of y does you no good

00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:58.080
unless you also get
one more unit of x.

00:16:58.080 --> 00:16:59.020
So what's an example?

00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:01.645
What's a real world example of
a Leontieff production function?

00:17:01.645 --> 00:17:04.040
What's a good which would
have non-substitutable inputs?

00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:07.119
We'd need at least one of each.

00:17:07.119 --> 00:17:08.240
Yeah.

00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:11.030
AUDIENCE: If you have like
programmers and computers,

00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:11.870
[INAUDIBLE].

00:17:13.887 --> 00:17:16.470
JONATHAN GRUBER: Programmers and
computers, that's a good one.

00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:19.230
AUDIENCE: It's like, you
need like a right shoe.

00:17:19.230 --> 00:17:20.099
JONATHAN GRUBER: You need a
right shoe and a left shoe.

00:17:20.099 --> 00:17:21.660
That's a classic
example I would use.

00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:24.540
Cereal and cereal boxes
stuff like that, you know,

00:17:24.540 --> 00:17:26.040
stuff where you
basically need both.

00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:28.860
Shoes are the sort of
classic example, OK.

00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:32.770
And that will give you sort of
a Leontieff production function,

00:17:32.770 --> 00:17:33.780
OK.

00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:36.300
So basically,
those extremes help

00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:40.510
you think about what isoquants
are and what they mean.

00:17:40.510 --> 00:17:44.840
Now, continuing our
parallel to consumer theory,

00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:48.580
what is the slope
of the isoqaunt?

00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:50.770
What is the slope
of the isoquant?

00:17:50.770 --> 00:17:52.810
The slope of the
isoqaunt, just as we

00:17:52.810 --> 00:17:54.730
call the slope of
the indifference

00:17:54.730 --> 00:17:57.520
curve the marginal rate of
substitution, since we're not

00:17:57.520 --> 00:18:01.030
very creative in economics, we
call the slope of the isoqaunt

00:18:01.030 --> 00:18:03.950
the marginal rate of
technical substitution,

00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:06.370
because it's the same idea,
but now it's technical.

00:18:06.370 --> 00:18:08.350
It come from a technical
production function,

00:18:08.350 --> 00:18:11.480
not from your preferences, OK.

00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:13.580
So marginal rate of
technical substitution

00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:25.190
is the slope of the isoquant,
or delta k over delta L.

00:18:25.190 --> 00:18:28.160
And as with indifference
curves, that slope

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:31.610
varies along the isoquant.

00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:37.260
So we can see that
in figure 5-3, OK.

00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:40.230
Figure 5-3 is once again drawn
for our production function,

00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:47.540
q equals square
root of k times L.

00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:51.260
So let's say for example, we
start with one worker and four

00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:56.460
machines at point A,
OK, and now we consider

00:18:56.460 --> 00:18:59.420
adding a second worker.

00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:02.630
Well, at point A,
that second worker

00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:08.010
is so productive because of
diminishing marginal products,

00:19:08.010 --> 00:19:08.510
OK.

00:19:08.510 --> 00:19:11.060
You already got four machines,
only one guy to run them.

00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:12.518
Like, he's not
doing a lot of good.

00:19:12.518 --> 00:19:15.110
So adding a second worker
and two machines helps a lot.

00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:19.910
It's not perfectly Leontieff,
but you can get the intuition

00:19:19.910 --> 00:19:23.240
that two workers
and two machines

00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:25.320
are the same as one
worker and four machines.

00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:25.750
You're not better off.

00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:26.670
You're the same off.

00:19:26.670 --> 00:19:28.193
You have the same isoquant.

00:19:28.193 --> 00:19:30.110
So the marginal rate of
technical substitution

00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:31.550
is minus 2.

00:19:31.550 --> 00:19:36.690
That is, one worker
substitutes for two machines,

00:19:36.690 --> 00:19:39.530
OK, one worker substitutes
for two machines.

00:19:39.530 --> 00:19:43.280
But now, starting from point
B and moving to point C,

00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:48.280
it takes two more workers to
substitute for one machine

00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:49.780
because, if you go
down one machine,

00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:52.060
you need a lot more
workers to make up for it.

00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:55.380
So then the MRTS
falls to minus 1/2.

00:19:55.380 --> 00:19:58.080
So, going from A
to B, one worker

00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:00.060
makes up for two machines.

00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:02.100
Going from B to C,
it takes two workers

00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:03.810
to make up for one machine.

00:20:03.810 --> 00:20:07.630
And that's because of
diminishing marginal products,

00:20:07.630 --> 00:20:08.430
OK?

00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:10.430
That's because of diminishing
marginal products.

00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:18.940
OK, indeed, there's a
convenient way mathematically

00:20:18.940 --> 00:20:21.490
to relate the marginal rate
of technical substitution

00:20:21.490 --> 00:20:23.440
to marginal products.

00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:25.810
Think of what the
MRTS is asking.

00:20:25.810 --> 00:20:27.760
Think of what we're
asking along the isoquant.

00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:31.870
We're saying what combinations
of capital and labor

00:20:31.870 --> 00:20:33.730
yield the same output.

00:20:33.730 --> 00:20:36.160
That's what we're asking, OK?

00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:40.410
So another way to think about
it is what change in capital

00:20:40.410 --> 00:20:42.690
plus an equivalent
change in labor

00:20:42.690 --> 00:20:45.060
leads to the same
level of output.

00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:49.580
So you can ask, well,
the change in labor

00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:52.610
times the marginal product
of a unit of labor,

00:20:52.610 --> 00:20:55.560
times the marginal product
of a unit of labor,

00:20:55.560 --> 00:21:00.280
plus the change in capital times
the marginal product of a unit

00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:01.530
of capital, which is the same.

00:21:01.530 --> 00:21:02.850
I didn't define marginal
product of capital.

00:21:02.850 --> 00:21:05.220
It's the same idea as
marginal product of labor.

00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:10.050
It's dq dk is the margin
product of capital.

00:21:10.050 --> 00:21:13.350
That equals 0 along an isoquant.

00:21:13.350 --> 00:21:14.250
Think about it.

00:21:14.250 --> 00:21:17.670
Along an isoquant, the
next unit of labor times

00:21:17.670 --> 00:21:21.180
how productive that labor is
plus the next unit of capital

00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:23.347
times how productive
that capital is

00:21:23.347 --> 00:21:25.430
equals 0 because you're
staying along an isoquant.

00:21:25.430 --> 00:21:27.560
So, if you're taking
away one unit of labor,

00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:31.730
if this is minus 1,
and this is plus 1,

00:21:31.730 --> 00:21:33.500
then, based along
the isoquant, you're

00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:37.840
choosing the point where
the MPL equals the MPK.

00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:40.790
Or, more generally, if
you reorganize this,

00:21:40.790 --> 00:21:45.230
you get that delta k over
delta L, which is the slope,

00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:50.630
equals minus MPL over MPK.

00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:57.320
And that is the MRTS, OK?

00:21:57.320 --> 00:22:00.600
The marginal rate of
technical substitution

00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:04.660
is the negative of the ratio of
the marginal product of labor

00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:07.040
and the marginal
product of capital.

00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:09.648
Once again, should
look familiar.

00:22:09.648 --> 00:22:11.690
It's just like the marginal
rate of substitution.

00:22:11.690 --> 00:22:13.910
It's the negative of
the marginal utility

00:22:13.910 --> 00:22:16.130
of the good on the x-axis
for the marginal utility

00:22:16.130 --> 00:22:19.010
of the good on the
y-axis, same idea.

00:22:19.010 --> 00:22:21.320
I derived it in a slightly
different way here,

00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:23.738
but it's the same idea.

00:22:23.738 --> 00:22:25.280
And it comes from
the notion that you

00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:27.920
wanted to stay-- that you're
staying constant production,

00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:32.060
as you change labor and
capital along this curve.

00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:32.560
Yeah?

00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:37.900
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
MPK over MPL [INAUDIBLE]

00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:41.393
give you the same ratio or no?

00:22:41.393 --> 00:22:43.560
JONATHAN GRUBER: Well, MPK
over MPL would give you--

00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:44.880
I mean, basically,
we're defining

00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:47.005
the marginal rate of
technical substitution the way

00:22:47.005 --> 00:22:49.080
we define--

00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:51.810
the way we define the
marginal rate of substitution.

00:22:51.810 --> 00:22:54.600
You basically want-- because you
want it to be downward sloping.

00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:57.468
If you define that, the inverse
would be upward sloping.

00:22:57.468 --> 00:22:59.760
So what we're defining is
the downward-sloping concept,

00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:01.380
which is the marginal
product of the good

00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:02.560
on the x-axis and
marginal product

00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:03.662
of the good on the y-axis.

00:23:03.662 --> 00:23:04.620
So it's not invertible.

00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:06.670
It's not freely invertible.

00:23:06.670 --> 00:23:07.590
Yeah?

00:23:07.590 --> 00:23:09.007
AUDIENCE: What's
the marginal rate

00:23:09.007 --> 00:23:11.603
of technical substitution for
a Leontief production function?

00:23:11.603 --> 00:23:13.770
JONATHAN GRUBER: Ah, great
question, great question.

00:23:13.770 --> 00:23:15.770
So, the marginal rate of
technical substitution,

00:23:15.770 --> 00:23:18.730
so let's go back to Leontief.

00:23:18.730 --> 00:23:22.640
OK, the marginal rate of
technical substitution

00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:25.070
actually sort of depends on--

00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:26.870
it sort of depends
on where you are.

00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:28.470
It's sort of a
nonlinear marginal rate

00:23:28.470 --> 00:23:30.680
of technical
substitution, right?

00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:34.130
So, basically, it's going
to very much depend--

00:23:34.130 --> 00:23:35.540
depend on where you are.

00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:37.790
So, basically, it can be
negative infinity or positive

00:23:37.790 --> 00:23:40.082
infinity or 0, depending on
where you are on the curve.

00:23:40.082 --> 00:23:42.457
So we'll actually-- I don't
want to give you more on that

00:23:42.457 --> 00:23:43.640
because this problem may--

00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:45.557
I'm not giving anything
away-- could obviously

00:23:45.557 --> 00:23:47.010
be a problem set problem.

00:23:47.010 --> 00:23:49.177
So I don't want to give
more answers than that away,

00:23:49.177 --> 00:23:51.560
but, certainly,
it's going to be--

00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:55.100
it's not going to
be constant, OK?

00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:56.700
Other questions?

00:23:56.700 --> 00:23:57.640
Yeah?

00:23:57.640 --> 00:23:59.780
AUDIENCE: It's just
like a line, right?

00:23:59.780 --> 00:24:01.280
JONATHAN GRUBER:
The marginal rate--

00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:03.863
if the curve is just a line, the
marginal rate of substitution

00:24:03.863 --> 00:24:05.220
would be constant.

00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:08.330
For perfectly substitutable
inputs, it would be constant.

00:24:08.330 --> 00:24:11.117
That's right, just like the
marginal rate of substation

00:24:11.117 --> 00:24:12.700
would be constant
if your indifference

00:24:12.700 --> 00:24:15.690
curves were linear, OK?

00:24:15.690 --> 00:24:16.920
Good questions.

00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:20.740
OK, so that's production, OK?

00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:23.370
Other questions
about production?

00:24:23.370 --> 00:24:25.625
OK, that's the basics,
and we went fast

00:24:25.625 --> 00:24:27.000
because, basically,
a lot of it's

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:30.660
just parallel to what we did
with consumer theory, OK?

00:24:30.660 --> 00:24:34.800
Now but I want to talk about
two other aspects of production

00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:38.460
that we need to keep in
mind as we move forward.

00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:41.340
The first and the
fourth topic for today

00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:54.280
is returns to scale,
returns to scale, OK?

00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:56.560
This is what
returns to scale are

00:24:56.560 --> 00:25:01.390
asking is what happens to
production when you increase

00:25:01.390 --> 00:25:04.310
all inputs proportionally.

00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:07.820
So, if you double all inputs or
triple all inputs or whatever,

00:25:07.820 --> 00:25:12.110
cut all inputs by 73%,
what happens to production?

00:25:12.110 --> 00:25:14.590
So it's not about
K versus L. It's

00:25:14.590 --> 00:25:20.250
about a scale, a scaling up
or down of the operation, OK?

00:25:20.250 --> 00:25:22.860
Now we know, obviously,
if you double inputs,

00:25:22.860 --> 00:25:24.420
production will go up.

00:25:24.420 --> 00:25:25.860
More is better.

00:25:25.860 --> 00:25:28.630
The question is by how much.

00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:31.350
So our baseline
we can think about

00:25:31.350 --> 00:25:33.810
as what we call a constant
returns to scale production

00:25:33.810 --> 00:25:35.070
function.

00:25:35.070 --> 00:25:45.033
That would be one where f of
2L, 2K equals 2 times f of L, K.

00:25:45.033 --> 00:25:46.950
So a constant returns
to scale function means,

00:25:46.950 --> 00:25:50.730
if you double inputs,
you double output.

00:25:50.730 --> 00:25:53.490
If you double inputs,
you double output.

00:25:53.490 --> 00:25:56.770
That's a constant returns to
scale production function.

00:25:56.770 --> 00:25:59.380
But you could also
define increasing returns

00:25:59.380 --> 00:26:03.460
to scale, where doubling inputs
leads to more than double

00:26:03.460 --> 00:26:06.700
the output, or
decreasing returns

00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:08.950
to scale where
doubling the inputs

00:26:08.950 --> 00:26:11.260
leads to less than
double the output.

00:26:11.260 --> 00:26:12.760
So constant returns
to scale means

00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:15.640
doubling the inputs leads
to double the output.

00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:17.890
Increasing returns
to scale means more

00:26:17.890 --> 00:26:21.363
than doubling the inputs more
than doubles the output--

00:26:21.363 --> 00:26:23.530
I'm sorry, means double the
inputs more than doubles

00:26:23.530 --> 00:26:24.750
the output.

00:26:24.750 --> 00:26:28.480
Decreasing returns the scale
means doubling the inputs less

00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:31.480
than doubles the output, OK?

00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:33.310
And that gives you--

00:26:33.310 --> 00:26:35.830
that's your definition
of returns to scale.

00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:38.427
Now where could these come from?

00:26:38.427 --> 00:26:40.510
So increasing returns to
scale, for example, where

00:26:40.510 --> 00:26:42.302
could increasing--
that's the world's worst

00:26:42.302 --> 00:26:45.850
S. Where could increasing
returns to scale come from, OK?

00:26:45.850 --> 00:26:48.450
So, for example, one reason
for increasing returns to scale

00:26:48.450 --> 00:26:50.200
is that, basically,
as a firm gets bigger,

00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:52.370
it might learn to specialize.

00:26:52.370 --> 00:26:56.080
So maybe a firm with two
workers and two computers,

00:26:56.080 --> 00:26:58.580
and you double, and you get
four workers and four computers,

00:26:58.580 --> 00:27:00.710
and then you could
specialize the tasks more.

00:27:00.710 --> 00:27:02.960
And each worker is more
efficient in their specialized

00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:04.040
task.

00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:06.302
That could lead to
increasing returns to scale.

00:27:06.302 --> 00:27:07.760
That's an example
of something that

00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:10.430
could lead to increasing
returns to scale.

00:27:10.430 --> 00:27:13.530
Decreasing returns to scale
could come through something

00:27:13.530 --> 00:27:15.185
like difficulty of coordination.

00:27:15.185 --> 00:27:17.310
Maybe, when I've got two
workers and two computers,

00:27:17.310 --> 00:27:20.160
I can keep an eye on them and
make sure they don't slack off.

00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:21.540
But, with four workers
and four computers,

00:27:21.540 --> 00:27:22.998
there's more slacking
off because I

00:27:22.998 --> 00:27:25.060
can't keep an eye
on them all the time

00:27:25.060 --> 00:27:26.790
and more so with 8
and 16, et cetera.

00:27:26.790 --> 00:27:27.456
Yeah?

00:27:27.456 --> 00:27:30.360
AUDIENCE: So, when--
I have to ask,

00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:34.010
why is doubling the inputs
greater than two times

00:27:34.010 --> 00:27:34.773
the outputs?

00:27:34.773 --> 00:27:37.190
JONATHAN GRUBER: Yeah, so,
basically, doubling the input--

00:27:37.190 --> 00:27:39.070
so, when I move to two
workers and two computers

00:27:39.070 --> 00:27:40.530
to four workers
and four computers,

00:27:40.530 --> 00:27:42.173
I more than double my output.

00:27:42.173 --> 00:27:43.840
And that's because
maybe they specialize

00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:44.915
and get more productive.

00:27:44.915 --> 00:27:50.620
AUDIENCE: Oh, so f of L, K
equals the original output.

00:27:50.620 --> 00:27:53.310
JONATHAN GRUBER: Yeah, so,
well, it's one function.

00:27:53.310 --> 00:27:54.880
f of L, it's literally
one function.

00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:56.463
It's literally-- so
I'll write it out.

00:27:56.463 --> 00:27:59.590
It's literally saying
doubling my inputs leads

00:27:59.590 --> 00:28:03.490
to more than twice
what I get with just--

00:28:03.490 --> 00:28:05.630
without doubling
the outputs, OK?

00:28:05.630 --> 00:28:07.542
Is that another way
to think about it?

00:28:07.542 --> 00:28:08.504
Yeah?

00:28:08.504 --> 00:28:10.800
AUDIENCE: So, when we're
talking about the returns

00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:14.430
of our-- our return
to scale, is that

00:28:14.430 --> 00:28:16.615
how much product
is being produced

00:28:16.615 --> 00:28:17.990
or how much profit
is being made?

00:28:17.990 --> 00:28:18.560
JONATHAN GRUBER:
How much product.

00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:20.435
We're only-- we haven't
gotten to profit yet.

00:28:20.435 --> 00:28:22.203
We're only talking
about quantity.

00:28:22.203 --> 00:28:23.620
We're only talking
about quantity.

00:28:23.620 --> 00:28:25.960
f is-- remember,
f is the function

00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:28.880
that translates inputs to q.

00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:29.883
Yeah?

00:28:29.883 --> 00:28:31.300
AUDIENCE: Are
things intrinsically

00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:33.310
like increasing return
to scale functions

00:28:33.310 --> 00:28:34.240
or decreasing return
to scale functions?

00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:34.840
JONATHAN GRUBER:
Well, great question.

00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:36.070
So what do you think?

00:28:36.070 --> 00:28:38.920
What's the right answer?

00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:40.850
What do we think in reality?

00:28:40.850 --> 00:28:42.570
AUDIENCE: I mean,
like, perhaps, maybe

00:28:42.570 --> 00:28:44.800
there could be ways
to shift it or not.

00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:47.140
Like, going back to the
whole example you gave about

00:28:47.140 --> 00:28:49.015
decreasing-- like, if
there's more computers,

00:28:49.015 --> 00:28:50.963
people can start slacking off--

00:28:50.963 --> 00:28:52.755
if he set like-- if
you set some parameters

00:28:52.755 --> 00:28:56.705
or like you deactivated social
media on those computers

00:28:56.705 --> 00:28:58.080
that they couldn't
go on Facebook

00:28:58.080 --> 00:28:59.730
when like you weren't
watching them,

00:28:59.730 --> 00:29:02.065
you could make them be
more productive per se.

00:29:02.065 --> 00:29:03.940
JONATHAN GRUBER: Well,
it's a great question.

00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:06.870
Let's start by looking
at figure 5-4 and show

00:29:06.870 --> 00:29:09.100
some examples of what we
think about like decreasing,

00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:10.267
increasing returns to scale.

00:29:10.267 --> 00:29:15.722
So figure 5-4 has some examples
of the kind of industries

00:29:15.722 --> 00:29:18.180
people think are potentially
decreasing, increasing returns

00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:20.010
to scale, OK?

00:29:20.010 --> 00:29:23.550
So, for example, we think
the production of tobacco

00:29:23.550 --> 00:29:26.250
is a decreasing returns
to scale activity.

00:29:26.250 --> 00:29:28.110
That is you're kind
of farming tobacco.

00:29:28.110 --> 00:29:28.860
You're growing it.

00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:30.000
You're producing it.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.460
Then, if you kind
of double it up,

00:29:32.460 --> 00:29:35.550
there's still a certain amount
of land you're working on.

00:29:35.550 --> 00:29:38.400
You can't-- there's still sort
of a certain amount of crop.

00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:40.108
You're not going to
produce twice as much

00:29:40.108 --> 00:29:42.440
by having twice as many
threshers and workers,

00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:46.430
whereas, maybe something
like producing primary metal,

00:29:46.430 --> 00:29:49.563
OK, you could basically maybe
work a lot more efficiently

00:29:49.563 --> 00:29:51.230
by having more machines
and more workers

00:29:51.230 --> 00:29:54.600
together producing that metal.

00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:56.430
So what is the right answer?

00:29:56.430 --> 00:29:58.100
The right answer
is we don't know,

00:29:58.100 --> 00:30:01.640
but the one thing we do know
is there can never be forever

00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:03.410
increasing returns to scale.

00:30:03.410 --> 00:30:04.910
And why is that?

00:30:04.910 --> 00:30:07.720
Well, at least, we used to
think this maybe 15 years ago.

00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:08.220
Why is that?

00:30:08.220 --> 00:30:11.690
Why can there-- what
would happen in an economy

00:30:11.690 --> 00:30:15.080
if a firm had forever
increasing returns to scale?

00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:15.580
Yeah?

00:30:15.580 --> 00:30:16.840
AUDIENCE: You'd get a monopoly.

00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:18.548
JONATHAN GRUBER: It
would own the economy

00:30:18.548 --> 00:30:21.130
because, the bigger I got,
the more productive I'd get.

00:30:21.130 --> 00:30:23.980
So I would just eventually
grow and own the whole economy.

00:30:23.980 --> 00:30:26.030
Now, actually, that
may be happening.

00:30:26.030 --> 00:30:29.600
So maybe it's not as weird
as we thought it was 15--

00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:32.740
maybe Google and the big
five have increasing returns

00:30:32.740 --> 00:30:33.790
to scale.

00:30:33.790 --> 00:30:36.340
But, eventually, we think
returns to scale must decrease.

00:30:36.340 --> 00:30:37.715
We think your
scale of production

00:30:37.715 --> 00:30:40.730
must get so unwieldy
that doubling it

00:30:40.730 --> 00:30:43.660
means you just can't
manage it as effectively.

00:30:43.660 --> 00:30:46.623
Eventually, we think returns
to scale must decrease.

00:30:46.623 --> 00:30:48.290
That's sort of the
one sort of principle

00:30:48.290 --> 00:30:50.750
we have that we don't know--

00:30:50.750 --> 00:30:53.480
we think, generally, probably,
in the life cycle of firms,

00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:56.312
returns to scale are probably
increasing and then decreasing.

00:30:56.312 --> 00:30:57.770
But we don't know
where it happens.

00:30:57.770 --> 00:30:59.780
And, certainly, companies
like Google and Amazon

00:30:59.780 --> 00:31:01.405
are showing us that
point of decreasing

00:31:01.405 --> 00:31:05.830
may happen a lot later
than we thought, OK?

00:31:05.830 --> 00:31:08.230
And that's because I think
what we didn't account

00:31:08.230 --> 00:31:11.250
for in our traditional
producer theory

00:31:11.250 --> 00:31:13.440
is networks, the
fact that networks

00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:14.533
get ever more productive.

00:31:14.533 --> 00:31:16.450
We always thought about
buildings and workers,

00:31:16.450 --> 00:31:18.060
and there's a limit to how
productive they can get.

00:31:18.060 --> 00:31:20.143
But networks, by bringing
in more and more people,

00:31:20.143 --> 00:31:21.720
can get ever more productive.

00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:24.210
But, at some point, we think
these things have to decrease.

00:31:24.210 --> 00:31:25.800
At least, we
traditionally thought so,

00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:28.650
but maybe, in 10 years when
Google owns everything,

00:31:28.650 --> 00:31:31.130
I'll change my tune, OK?

00:31:31.130 --> 00:31:33.140
But that's sort of the
one sort of rule of thumb

00:31:33.140 --> 00:31:35.485
we have in thinking
about this, OK?

00:31:35.485 --> 00:31:36.610
Other questions about that?

00:31:39.270 --> 00:31:43.880
OK, let's talk about
the last topic then,

00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:48.650
which is productivity,
how this stuff

00:31:48.650 --> 00:31:50.000
all matters in the real world.

00:31:52.573 --> 00:31:54.240
So we're going to
come back next lecture

00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:57.690
and come back to maximizing
profits and all that stuff,

00:31:57.690 --> 00:31:59.190
but I want to sort
of step aside now

00:31:59.190 --> 00:32:02.430
and ask why does
this all matter.

00:32:02.430 --> 00:32:05.430
And, to do so,
let's step way back

00:32:05.430 --> 00:32:10.050
to the original dismal
scientist, Thomas Malthus.

00:32:10.050 --> 00:32:18.170
Thomas Malthus in 1798
wrote a book, which said--

00:32:18.170 --> 00:32:20.682
which was really
pretty depressing.

00:32:20.682 --> 00:32:23.140
He said, look, let's think
about how basic economics works.

00:32:23.140 --> 00:32:24.240
Now he didn't do the math.

00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:25.460
This is pre-math.

00:32:25.460 --> 00:32:27.810
So let's get the
basic intuition.

00:32:27.810 --> 00:32:29.860
Think about the
production of food.

00:32:29.860 --> 00:32:36.950
OK, the production of food has
two inputs, labor and land.

00:32:36.950 --> 00:32:39.380
There's workers, and then--
you know, there's machines,

00:32:39.380 --> 00:32:41.350
but they're pretty
simple machines.

00:32:41.350 --> 00:32:45.590
OK, you sort of till the
land, and there's land.

00:32:45.590 --> 00:32:48.320
Well, in the long run--

00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:49.820
in the short run,
labor is variable.

00:32:49.820 --> 00:32:51.410
In the long run,
labor is variable.

00:32:51.410 --> 00:32:53.210
But land is never variable.

00:32:53.210 --> 00:32:55.700
Land is a forever fixed input.

00:32:55.700 --> 00:32:56.790
There's no long run.

00:32:56.790 --> 00:32:59.030
Unless we discover a
new planet, there's

00:32:59.030 --> 00:33:02.210
no long run over which
land is variable.

00:33:02.210 --> 00:33:04.850
What that means is that there
will be ever diminishing

00:33:04.850 --> 00:33:06.330
marginal product to farming.

00:33:06.330 --> 00:33:09.880
He didn't say it this way, but
this was sort of his intuition

00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:12.220
that more and more
workers will try to cram

00:33:12.220 --> 00:33:13.510
on a given acre of land.

00:33:13.510 --> 00:33:15.868
Each additional worker
can only do so much.

00:33:15.868 --> 00:33:17.410
And, eventually,
the marginal product

00:33:17.410 --> 00:33:20.110
will be diminishing, OK?

00:33:20.110 --> 00:33:23.740
The result is that productivity
will fall, the marginal product

00:33:23.740 --> 00:33:27.930
of labor, when each additional
worker will be less and less.

00:33:27.930 --> 00:33:31.345
And, as a result, we'll
starve because, basically, we

00:33:31.345 --> 00:33:32.970
have all these people
looking for work.

00:33:32.970 --> 00:33:35.570
There's nothing to do because
only a certain amount of land.

00:33:35.570 --> 00:33:36.660
They won't have anything
to do, and, eventually,

00:33:36.660 --> 00:33:37.770
they'll starve.

00:33:37.770 --> 00:33:39.420
So Malthus actually
predicted we would

00:33:39.420 --> 00:33:43.560
see cycles of mass starvation
through history, fun guy

00:33:43.560 --> 00:33:44.680
to have at a party.

00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:47.268
OK, he'd basically say we're
going to get overpopulated.

00:33:47.268 --> 00:33:49.560
These guys will have nothing
to do because there's only

00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:50.910
so much land they can work on.

00:33:50.910 --> 00:33:52.140
They'll die off.

00:33:52.140 --> 00:33:53.900
We'll eventually grow
overpopulated again.

00:33:53.900 --> 00:33:55.950
We'll get these cycles
of mass starvation.

00:33:55.950 --> 00:33:57.630
That was his prediction.

00:33:57.630 --> 00:34:01.260
Now, since he wrote that
book, world population

00:34:01.260 --> 00:34:04.690
has increased about 1,000%.

00:34:04.690 --> 00:34:08.370
And, yet, we're
fatter than ever.

00:34:08.370 --> 00:34:10.409
I'm not saying food
deprivation isn't

00:34:10.409 --> 00:34:12.659
a problem around the world,
but, certainly, the world

00:34:12.659 --> 00:34:17.830
is much better fed that
it was in 1798, OK?

00:34:17.830 --> 00:34:20.000
What did Malthus miss?

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:21.440
What did Malthus miss?

00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:23.414
What did we get wrong?

00:34:23.414 --> 00:34:24.312
Yeah?

00:34:24.312 --> 00:34:25.979
AUDIENCE: The classic
example against it

00:34:25.979 --> 00:34:27.745
is like he didn't
account for innovations.

00:34:27.745 --> 00:34:30.120
JONATHAN GRUBER: He didn't
account for innovation or what

00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:32.940
we call productivity--

00:34:32.940 --> 00:34:35.871
productivity, or you can
also call it innovation--

00:34:38.820 --> 00:34:41.360
and neither have we so far.

00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:46.040
We have written production
functions of the form q

00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:51.630
equals f of L and K, but,
in reality, the production

00:34:51.630 --> 00:34:57.100
function is actually q
equals A times f of L and K,

00:34:57.100 --> 00:34:59.680
maybe A of t, A sub t.

00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:02.980
And that's a production factor
that, basically, for a given

00:35:02.980 --> 00:35:06.583
amount of labor and capital,
as you get more productive,

00:35:06.583 --> 00:35:07.750
you can produce more things.

00:35:07.750 --> 00:35:10.330
The production function
itself changes.

00:35:10.330 --> 00:35:14.630
You get more productive
over time, OK?

00:35:14.630 --> 00:35:18.390
In agriculture,
how did we do this?

00:35:18.390 --> 00:35:20.420
Well, we did it in lots of ways.

00:35:20.420 --> 00:35:25.310
We invented cool new ways to
harvest the crop, tractors.

00:35:25.310 --> 00:35:28.480
We invented fertilizer,
chemical fertilizer.

00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:31.090
We invented
seed-resistant crops.

00:35:31.090 --> 00:35:33.730
We invented lots of things
that Malthus didn't see coming.

00:35:33.730 --> 00:35:36.850
So, as a result, even though the
land is just as fixed as it was

00:35:36.850 --> 00:35:39.308
in Malthus' time-- we still
haven't discovered a new planet

00:35:39.308 --> 00:35:40.360
we can farm on--

00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:43.080
we produce a lot more food
because of the factor A.

00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:46.160
The production function
itself has changed.

00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:49.110
We've become more productive.

00:35:49.110 --> 00:35:52.460
So productivity
is the factor that

00:35:52.460 --> 00:35:54.980
allows us-- or innovation
is the factor that

00:35:54.980 --> 00:35:58.790
allows us to produce more
and more with a given

00:35:58.790 --> 00:36:01.170
amount of inputs.

00:36:01.170 --> 00:36:04.320
So, actually, food consumption
per capita is rising.

00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:10.420
Since 1950, food consumption per
person in the world is up 40%,

00:36:10.420 --> 00:36:11.370
OK?

00:36:11.370 --> 00:36:14.080
So, while we have starvation,
and it's terrible, it's up.

00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:15.570
One side note, some
of you may have

00:36:15.570 --> 00:36:20.118
heard of a very famous
economist named Amartya Sen.

00:36:20.118 --> 00:36:21.660
He's a Nobel Prize
winning economist.

00:36:21.660 --> 00:36:24.510
His biggest-- one of
his main contributions

00:36:24.510 --> 00:36:28.440
was he studied famines,
and he said famines are not

00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:29.440
a technological problem.

00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:31.380
He said there's never
been in history a famine

00:36:31.380 --> 00:36:33.940
in a democracy.

00:36:33.940 --> 00:36:36.370
No democratic nation
has ever had a famine.

00:36:36.370 --> 00:36:38.080
Famines are not
about technology.

00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:40.028
Famines are about
politics and corruption

00:36:40.028 --> 00:36:42.070
and the things that get
in the way of proper food

00:36:42.070 --> 00:36:43.650
distribution.

00:36:43.650 --> 00:36:46.950
So really we have
enough food, OK?

00:36:46.950 --> 00:36:48.720
The food is there.

00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:49.470
Malthus was wrong.

00:36:53.070 --> 00:36:55.220
This is not just
true in agriculture.

00:36:55.220 --> 00:36:56.750
It's true all over the world.

00:36:56.750 --> 00:37:00.600
Let's look at car production,
one of most famous examples,

00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:01.790
OK?

00:37:01.790 --> 00:37:05.150
Cars have been around
since the late 1800s, OK?

00:37:05.150 --> 00:37:07.400
And they're basically-- when
cars were first invented,

00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:09.320
they were essentially
craftsmanship.

00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:11.960
Someone would sit down and make
a car if you can believe it.

00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:13.460
They'd literally
make all the parts.

00:37:13.460 --> 00:37:16.730
They'd make a car or a
couple people together.

00:37:16.730 --> 00:37:20.330
In the early 1900s,
Henry Ford introduced

00:37:20.330 --> 00:37:22.498
the idea of mass production--

00:37:22.498 --> 00:37:24.290
it seems sensible now,
but it's not the way

00:37:24.290 --> 00:37:25.520
they used to do it--

00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:29.060
a series of workers who each did
a discrete task along the way,

00:37:29.060 --> 00:37:30.280
constructing a car.

00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:32.030
So no worker did a
whole bunch of the car.

00:37:32.030 --> 00:37:34.280
Each worker did a
little piece, which

00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:35.780
massively led to
increasing returns

00:37:35.780 --> 00:37:39.590
to scale by specialization.

00:37:39.590 --> 00:37:43.700
He did that, and, basically,
this was radical at the time.

00:37:43.700 --> 00:37:47.240
It seems obvious to us now, but
he cut the price of building

00:37:47.240 --> 00:37:49.490
a car more than in
half almost overnight

00:37:49.490 --> 00:37:52.910
and basically wiped
out all his rivals

00:37:52.910 --> 00:37:54.995
through the introduction
of mass production.

00:37:54.995 --> 00:37:56.620
Now you might think
that's pretty cool,

00:37:56.620 --> 00:37:58.780
but, you know, that's
and old-time story.

00:37:58.780 --> 00:38:00.160
But it's not over.

00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:02.883
Innovation in car
production continues.

00:38:02.883 --> 00:38:05.050
The Indian company Tata,
you may have heard of them.

00:38:05.050 --> 00:38:06.190
They do a lot of MIT--

00:38:06.190 --> 00:38:08.140
they finance a lot
of stuff at MIT.

00:38:08.140 --> 00:38:13.030
They have a car called the Nano
that they produce for $2,500,

00:38:13.030 --> 00:38:13.950
OK?

00:38:13.950 --> 00:38:15.840
It's a tiny car.

00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:16.410
It's lighter.

00:38:16.410 --> 00:38:18.870
They use extra light materials.

00:38:18.870 --> 00:38:20.880
It's smaller because
they do things

00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:23.220
like putting wheels on the
extreme outside of the car,

00:38:23.220 --> 00:38:27.150
rather than sort of
underneath the car, OK?

00:38:27.150 --> 00:38:28.680
And they minimize
the parts that are

00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:30.680
used to make it easily
fixed and interchangeable

00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:32.135
with other cars.

00:38:32.135 --> 00:38:33.760
So innovation is
going on all the time.

00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:34.470
Look at hybrid.

00:38:34.470 --> 00:38:37.140
Look at the innovation in the
fuel space with hybrid cars

00:38:37.140 --> 00:38:38.840
and electric cars and Tesla.

00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:43.360
OK, innovation is
happening all the time.

00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:46.502
Now what's key about
this, besides the fact,

00:38:46.502 --> 00:38:48.960
technically, what this means
is that, when you write-- when

00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:50.290
we think about
production-- now we're not

00:38:50.290 --> 00:38:51.210
going to talk about this a lot.

00:38:51.210 --> 00:38:53.710
We'll assume that there's
constant production functions.

00:38:53.710 --> 00:38:54.910
But what that means
technically is,

00:38:54.910 --> 00:38:56.620
when we think about
over time production,

00:38:56.620 --> 00:38:58.750
innovation is a key factor.

00:38:58.750 --> 00:39:03.190
But what this means, in terms of
all of us sitting in this room,

00:39:03.190 --> 00:39:06.400
is that productivity
innovation is fundamentally

00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:09.610
what determines the standard
of living in a country.

00:39:13.060 --> 00:39:20.190
Our standard of living is
determined by productivity, OK?

00:39:20.190 --> 00:39:26.395
So, basically, if you
think about us as workers,

00:39:26.395 --> 00:39:27.853
if we're going to
get richer, we're

00:39:27.853 --> 00:39:30.310
going to have to
make more stuff, OK?

00:39:30.310 --> 00:39:34.870
We're going to have to make
more q or more valuable q, OK?

00:39:34.870 --> 00:39:37.510
Now, given our amount
of labor, that's

00:39:37.510 --> 00:39:41.860
either going to happen through
more K, through more capital,

00:39:41.860 --> 00:39:47.230
or through a faster A,
through faster innovation.

00:39:47.230 --> 00:39:51.250
So, ultimately, what determines
our standard of living--

00:39:51.250 --> 00:39:53.800
that is what determines
how much shit we have

00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:56.350
for a given amount of work--

00:39:56.350 --> 00:39:59.560
is going to be how much we
save and how innovative we are.

00:39:59.560 --> 00:40:01.960
I'm sorry, back, how
much capital we have

00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:03.075
and how innovative we are.

00:40:03.075 --> 00:40:05.200
Capital it turns out is
going to come from savings.

00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:06.200
I sort of cheated there.

00:40:06.200 --> 00:40:08.110
We're going to talk
about that in about--

00:40:08.110 --> 00:40:11.100
about maybe 12
lectures from now.

00:40:11.100 --> 00:40:12.850
We'll talk about where
capital comes from.

00:40:12.850 --> 00:40:15.370
The hint is capital comes
from how much we save,

00:40:15.370 --> 00:40:17.140
and I'll explain why that is.

00:40:17.140 --> 00:40:18.070
But our standard of
living is determined

00:40:18.070 --> 00:40:19.180
of how much capital
we have, which

00:40:19.180 --> 00:40:20.597
is a function of
how much we save,

00:40:20.597 --> 00:40:23.140
but it's mostly determined
by how innovative we are,

00:40:23.140 --> 00:40:26.890
how productive we are, how much
more we can produce for a given

00:40:26.890 --> 00:40:29.080
level of inputs, OK?

00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:30.370
And, if you look at--

00:40:30.370 --> 00:40:33.370
if you ask how does
production go up

00:40:33.370 --> 00:40:35.680
given an amount of
capital and labor,

00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:39.810
we call that total
factor productivity.

00:40:39.810 --> 00:40:42.800
That is, conditioning
on all the factors,

00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:47.150
how much does
productivity go up?

00:40:47.150 --> 00:40:50.960
Now it turns out we have seen
a massive shift in productivity

00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:53.030
in the US.

00:40:53.030 --> 00:40:58.970
From 1947, after
World War II, to 1973,

00:40:58.970 --> 00:41:00.890
productivity growth in
the US was very rapid,

00:41:00.890 --> 00:41:03.243
about 2 and 1/2% a year.

00:41:03.243 --> 00:41:05.410
What that meant-- let's
think about what that meant.

00:41:05.410 --> 00:41:08.050
That meant, not
doing anything else,

00:41:08.050 --> 00:41:10.450
working just as hard
as we were working,

00:41:10.450 --> 00:41:14.145
we could get 2 and 1/2%
more stuff every year, OK?

00:41:14.145 --> 00:41:16.020
That's what I mean by
our standard of living.

00:41:16.020 --> 00:41:19.350
Literally, it's saying,
working the same 40-hour week,

00:41:19.350 --> 00:41:25.160
every year, we got 2
and 1/2% more stuff, OK?

00:41:25.160 --> 00:41:29.210
However, from 1973
until the early 1990s,

00:41:29.210 --> 00:41:33.050
productivity growth slowed
down massively down to about 1%

00:41:33.050 --> 00:41:34.840
a year.

00:41:34.840 --> 00:41:37.810
It dropped massively, OK?

00:41:37.810 --> 00:41:40.610
Now what happened?

00:41:40.610 --> 00:41:44.360
Well, one thing that happened
is we started saving less.

00:41:44.360 --> 00:41:45.625
K went down.

00:41:45.625 --> 00:41:47.750
K is driven by savings,
and we started saving less.

00:41:47.750 --> 00:41:50.760
We save a lot less
than other nations.

00:41:50.760 --> 00:41:52.423
But, in fact, that's
not much of it

00:41:52.423 --> 00:41:54.090
because, even though
we don't save much,

00:41:54.090 --> 00:41:56.150
productivity jumped
again in the--

00:41:56.150 --> 00:41:59.520
about from 1995 to
2005, productivity

00:41:59.520 --> 00:42:03.890
jumped again and went up again
to about 2 and 1/2% a year.

00:42:03.890 --> 00:42:07.250
And, essentially, we felt,
ah, this is the IT boom.

00:42:07.250 --> 00:42:10.410
OK, computers were
around since the 1970s.

00:42:10.410 --> 00:42:12.670
And, throughout the late
1980s and early 1990s,

00:42:12.670 --> 00:42:14.462
people kept saying
where's the productivity

00:42:14.462 --> 00:42:15.360
gain from computers.

00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:18.540
And it appeared to show
up in the mid 1990s.

00:42:18.540 --> 00:42:21.195
Suddenly, things got more
productive in the mid 1990s

00:42:21.195 --> 00:42:24.860
to the mid 2000s, OK?

00:42:24.860 --> 00:42:27.260
Productivity rose to
about 2.3% a year.

00:42:27.260 --> 00:42:30.230
But, much to our
chagrin, productivity

00:42:30.230 --> 00:42:32.690
has stopped growing rapidly,
and it's back to about 1

00:42:32.690 --> 00:42:34.130
and 1/2% a year.

00:42:34.130 --> 00:42:35.960
So we're not as slow as we were.

00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:41.885
So we were-- so, from
1947, '47 to '73, we grew

00:42:41.885 --> 00:42:44.140
at about 2 and 1/2% a year.

00:42:44.140 --> 00:42:47.117
'73 to '95, it was
about 1% a year.

00:42:47.117 --> 00:42:48.950
So that meant, with the
same amount of work,

00:42:48.950 --> 00:42:51.790
we only got 1% more stuff, OK?

00:42:51.790 --> 00:42:56.330
'95 to '05, we went
up to about 2.3%.

00:42:56.330 --> 00:42:57.860
We jumped back up.

00:42:57.860 --> 00:43:02.727
But, since '05, we're
down at about 1.5%,

00:43:02.727 --> 00:43:04.310
so better than we
were at our minimum,

00:43:04.310 --> 00:43:09.850
but not nearly as high as
we were at our peak, OK?

00:43:09.850 --> 00:43:12.540
So, basically, this raises
three key questions.

00:43:12.540 --> 00:43:13.504
Yeah?

00:43:13.504 --> 00:43:15.640
AUDIENCE: How is that
productivity measured?

00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:17.140
JONATHAN GRUBER:
Oh, great question.

00:43:17.140 --> 00:43:20.560
So, basically, we look
at, essentially, a way--

00:43:20.560 --> 00:43:22.388
roughly speaking,
we look at how much

00:43:22.388 --> 00:43:24.430
stuff gets produced given
how many hours of labor

00:43:24.430 --> 00:43:26.380
there are submitted
to the economy.

00:43:26.380 --> 00:43:27.760
Roughly speaking, we say
how much do people work.

00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:28.802
How much stuff gets made?

00:43:28.802 --> 00:43:30.830
Boom, that's productivity,
nothing super fancy.

00:43:30.830 --> 00:43:31.330
Yeah?

00:43:31.330 --> 00:43:32.240
AUDIENCE: I might
have missed it,

00:43:32.240 --> 00:43:33.520
but what does TFP stand for?

00:43:33.520 --> 00:43:35.312
JONATHAN GRUBER: Total
factor productivity.

00:43:35.312 --> 00:43:37.365
That's productivity
controlling for capital.

00:43:37.365 --> 00:43:38.740
But the productivity
numbers here

00:43:38.740 --> 00:43:40.157
are not total
factor productivity.

00:43:40.157 --> 00:43:42.710
They're just labor productivity,
allowing capital to change.

00:43:42.710 --> 00:43:43.210
Yeah?

00:43:43.210 --> 00:43:45.835
AUDIENCE: You said that K would
decrease when people save less.

00:43:45.835 --> 00:43:48.290
But, if you save less, isn't
your spending someone else's

00:43:48.290 --> 00:43:48.840
likely [INAUDIBLE]?

00:43:48.840 --> 00:43:49.210
JONATHAN GRUBER: You know what?

00:43:49.210 --> 00:43:50.380
I don't want to go there.

00:43:50.380 --> 00:43:52.030
We're going to spend a
whole lecture on that.

00:43:52.030 --> 00:43:52.980
So I don't want to go there.

00:43:52.980 --> 00:43:54.000
K depends on savings.

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:55.140
Just take that as
a given for now,

00:43:55.140 --> 00:43:56.307
and we'll come back to that.

00:43:56.307 --> 00:43:58.710
We'll spend two lectures
on it actually, OK?

00:43:58.710 --> 00:44:00.800
Now I want to raise
three questions,

00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:03.840
before we go, about
these facts, OK?

00:44:03.840 --> 00:44:08.295
The first question is why
didn't the IT revolution

00:44:08.295 --> 00:44:10.920
and the computer revolution lead
to longer lasting productivity

00:44:10.920 --> 00:44:11.950
gains?

00:44:11.950 --> 00:44:16.290
Why did productivity slow
back down after 2005, OK?

00:44:16.290 --> 00:44:17.820
We don't really know.

00:44:17.820 --> 00:44:20.340
Folks thought that computers
would be the next Industrial

00:44:20.340 --> 00:44:21.330
Revolution.

00:44:21.330 --> 00:44:22.955
This was going to be
a-- this was going

00:44:22.955 --> 00:44:24.930
to transform our lives, OK?

00:44:24.930 --> 00:44:28.440
It looks like what it mostly did
is transform how we watch porn,

00:44:28.440 --> 00:44:29.700
OK?

00:44:29.700 --> 00:44:34.020
And, basically, it looks like,
in terms of productivity,

00:44:34.020 --> 00:44:37.020
it did not actually
change things that much.

00:44:37.020 --> 00:44:40.043
And we don't quite know why,
but it is still a bit worrisome

00:44:40.043 --> 00:44:42.210
that, in terms of the long
run, that, in some sense,

00:44:42.210 --> 00:44:46.621
there wasn't longer lasting
gains from innovation.

00:44:46.621 --> 00:44:48.788
If it's a question about
porn, I'm not answering it.

00:44:48.788 --> 00:44:51.180
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:51.180 --> 00:44:53.430
AUDIENCE: Maybe with like
how, if you pull more people

00:44:53.430 --> 00:44:55.508
into like a team,
working on team projects,

00:44:55.508 --> 00:44:58.050
the rate at which the project
is worked on tends to decrease.

00:44:58.050 --> 00:44:59.920
JONATHAN GRUBER: You know,
there's lots of theories.

00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:01.470
We could hypothesize
all day about why it is.

00:45:01.470 --> 00:45:02.845
I'm just going to
state the facts

00:45:02.845 --> 00:45:05.870
and say that it's disappointing.

00:45:05.870 --> 00:45:10.030
And we need to figure
out what to do about it.

00:45:10.030 --> 00:45:14.760
The second question this raises
is how do we spend increases

00:45:14.760 --> 00:45:15.480
in productivity.

00:45:15.480 --> 00:45:16.840
What do I mean by that?

00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:19.590
What I mean by
that is, if there's

00:45:19.590 --> 00:45:21.750
an increase in
productivity of 2 and 1/2%,

00:45:21.750 --> 00:45:24.420
that means we have 2
and 1/2% more stuff

00:45:24.420 --> 00:45:26.250
for the same amount of work.

00:45:26.250 --> 00:45:28.410
But why do we have the
same amount of work?

00:45:28.410 --> 00:45:31.490
Another way to say that is
we can work 2 and 1/2% less

00:45:31.490 --> 00:45:34.335
and have the same amount of
stuff, roughly speaking, OK?

00:45:34.335 --> 00:45:36.710
So I have assumed we work the
same, and we get 2 and 1/2%

00:45:36.710 --> 00:45:39.690
more stuff, but why is
that the right answer, OK?

00:45:39.690 --> 00:45:44.510
And, in fact, the US and
Europe, since World War II,

00:45:44.510 --> 00:45:47.390
have taken very different
paths in this dimension.

00:45:47.390 --> 00:45:49.770
In the US, we've taken
all our productivity

00:45:49.770 --> 00:45:53.760
and put it into cooler stuff,
and we work harder than ever.

00:45:53.760 --> 00:45:55.800
In Europe, they work less hard.

00:45:55.800 --> 00:45:58.980
I mean, starting jobs in Europe
have six weeks vacation, OK?

00:45:58.980 --> 00:46:02.007
Nothing gets done in
August in Europe, OK?

00:46:02.007 --> 00:46:04.090
They've said-- and, you
know, if you go to Europe,

00:46:04.090 --> 00:46:06.398
it's a little bit
more rundown, OK?

00:46:06.398 --> 00:46:08.190
It's not quite as
gleaming and cutting edge

00:46:08.190 --> 00:46:10.395
as the US in many places, OK?

00:46:10.395 --> 00:46:13.020
Basically, Europe has decided to
take some of that productivity

00:46:13.020 --> 00:46:15.268
increase and put it
into more leisure time.

00:46:15.268 --> 00:46:17.310
We've decided take all
that productivity increase

00:46:17.310 --> 00:46:21.420
and put it into better
phones and gadgets, OK?

00:46:21.420 --> 00:46:22.740
So the question is who's right.

00:46:22.740 --> 00:46:23.700
We don't know.

00:46:23.700 --> 00:46:25.980
But the important point is
that's an open question.

00:46:25.980 --> 00:46:27.030
Just because we're
more productive

00:46:27.030 --> 00:46:28.470
doesn't mean we should
just consume more stuff.

00:46:28.470 --> 00:46:30.928
There's an open question of
how you spend your productivity

00:46:30.928 --> 00:46:32.185
gains.

00:46:32.185 --> 00:46:34.060
And then there's the
final question and maybe

00:46:34.060 --> 00:46:38.010
the most important, which
is who actually gains

00:46:38.010 --> 00:46:40.510
from productivity increases.

00:46:40.510 --> 00:46:46.050
So, from 1947 to 1973,
productivity went up 2.5%,

00:46:46.050 --> 00:46:48.480
and virtually every
group in society

00:46:48.480 --> 00:46:52.340
saw their incomes go
up 2 and 1/2% a year.

00:46:52.340 --> 00:46:55.070
Since 1973, on average,
productivity growth

00:46:55.070 --> 00:46:58.130
has been about 1.5%,
1.6% on average.

00:46:58.130 --> 00:47:02.150
You average these three
series, about 1.6%.

00:47:02.150 --> 00:47:04.760
And average incomes
have only gone up 0.4%.

00:47:07.430 --> 00:47:10.010
So productivity
has gone up 1.6%,

00:47:10.010 --> 00:47:12.470
but average income
has only gone up 0.4%.

00:47:12.470 --> 00:47:14.000
The difference is
the gains have all

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:16.960
gone to the top of the
income distribution.

00:47:16.960 --> 00:47:19.800
So, basically, virtually all
of the gains from 1973 until

00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:22.050
a couple of years ago--
it's started to get better--

00:47:22.050 --> 00:47:24.690
essentially, the
bottom 80% of people

00:47:24.690 --> 00:47:27.210
saw no improvement of
their standard of living

00:47:27.210 --> 00:47:30.687
over a 45-year period,
whereas the top 20%

00:47:30.687 --> 00:47:31.770
saw a massive improvement.

00:47:31.770 --> 00:47:33.605
And, even within
that, the top 1%

00:47:33.605 --> 00:47:34.980
saw a really
massive improvement.

00:47:34.980 --> 00:47:37.770
And, even within that,
the top 0.1% and 0.01%,

00:47:37.770 --> 00:47:40.230
et cetera, saw
massive improvements.

00:47:40.230 --> 00:47:44.340
So, as a result, in
1995, the richest 10%--

00:47:44.340 --> 00:47:47.400
or the richest 10%
of the population

00:47:47.400 --> 00:47:49.380
earned 15% of the income.

00:47:49.380 --> 00:47:52.700
Today, it's close to
25% of the income.

00:47:52.700 --> 00:47:53.700
It's getting even worse.

00:47:53.700 --> 00:47:58.080
Since 2009, if you look
from 2009 to 2016--

00:47:58.080 --> 00:47:59.340
I don't have it updated--

00:47:59.340 --> 00:48:00.840
and you look at
all the money that

00:48:00.840 --> 00:48:05.790
was made in society, on net,
all of it went to the top 1%.

00:48:05.790 --> 00:48:06.810
What do I mean by that?

00:48:06.810 --> 00:48:10.680
The top 99% were, in
2016, in the same place

00:48:10.680 --> 00:48:14.220
they were in 2009, even
though the economy had grown.

00:48:14.220 --> 00:48:17.320
And all the growth
went to the top 1%.

00:48:17.320 --> 00:48:19.360
So we're actually in
an interesting world

00:48:19.360 --> 00:48:21.100
here where productivity
gains by itself

00:48:21.100 --> 00:48:23.440
may not be enough if
we care about what

00:48:23.440 --> 00:48:25.210
it does to the average
standard of living.

00:48:25.210 --> 00:48:26.877
And that leads to a
very interesting set

00:48:26.877 --> 00:48:28.400
of issues around
equity and fairness

00:48:28.400 --> 00:48:30.730
that we'll spend time on
later in the semester.

00:48:30.730 --> 00:48:33.220
But I want to raise that
issue, both that productivity

00:48:33.220 --> 00:48:35.953
gains can be spent in different
ways on goods and leisure,

00:48:35.953 --> 00:48:37.870
and they can be distributed
in different ways.

00:48:37.870 --> 00:48:38.800
And those are the
sorts of things

00:48:38.800 --> 00:48:40.467
we need to be thinking
about as we think

00:48:40.467 --> 00:48:42.070
about economic policy, OK?

00:48:42.070 --> 00:48:43.520
So let me stop there.

00:48:43.520 --> 00:48:45.010
We'll come back--

00:48:45.010 --> 00:48:46.510
I guess no section
on Friday, right?

00:48:46.510 --> 00:48:47.770
It's an MIT holiday.

00:48:47.770 --> 00:48:49.650
And we'll come back on
Monday and talk more

00:48:49.650 --> 00:48:51.600
on producer theory.

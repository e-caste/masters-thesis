00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.040
GARY GENSLER: Welcome
back to Fintech:

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.160
Shaping the Financial World.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.180
This is our last time together.

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.020
And so we're going to
try to summarize up

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:26.800
what this semester's been and
some thoughts going forward

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.580
as all of you go
forth, and try to think

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:34.610
about this intersection
of technology and finance.

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:39.140
And again, we've taught it
from that point of view,

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.270
not necessarily just
about startups, but how

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.240
technology and
finance come together

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.040
in the world of finance.

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.920
And it's been shaping it,
really, for centuries.

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.710
But the dominant sort of themes
that we've been talking about

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.120
is the new technologies that,
in the last five to 15 years,

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.720
have really been
transforming finance

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.540
around artificial
intelligence and machine

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.080
learning, natural
language processing,

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.420
having dramatic changes, but
also open API and the access

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:18.050
to data through technological
connections, sometimes done

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:20.990
by commerce, sometimes the
official sector has sort of

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.720
moved and pressed against it.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.070
And then, of course, data,
and all the different forms

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.970
of alternative data, some off
of just traditional means,

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.740
like whether we pay our rent on
time, some from social media.

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.420
And then when we
looked at insurtech,

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.160
that I know really
lifted the class up,

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.840
this look at
insurance and finance,

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.550
but then also telematics,
meaning all the data

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:52.430
that a car brings
on us, or wearables,

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.090
if we wear a Fitbit or
a watch or something,

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.170
or the Internet of Things.

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.590
And then we've talked even
about some technologies that

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.140
haven't yet come into
the technology stack,

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.720
like blockchain
technology, and will it?

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.460
It's already been a
catalyst for change,

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:12.140
but will it sort of come in and
dramatically change finance.

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:17.270
So as we normally do, if we can
try to be part of the community

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:21.110
and have our videos on, I
still see some with it off.

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.160
I know at 12 lectures in,
and it's early morning.

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.090
But I think if we can just
try to close out together

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.030
with our videos on, and
if you have questions,

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.210
raising the little
Zoom blue hand

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:36.800
or going into the chat room.

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.130
And Romain is going
to take a close look

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:42.680
and try to have a dialogue here.

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.890
I do have some slides to put up.

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.930
I'm still the same faculty
member of the other 11 classes,

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.340
but let me share some
slides and we'll get going.

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.020
So we're going to talk a
little bit about this finance

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:15.650
technology stack and how I see
these technologies fitting in,

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:20.090
the actors again, and then
a review of the key areas,

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.970
machine learning, open
API, credit scoring,

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:24.740
alternative data,
and the question

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:27.530
marks around
blockchain technology.

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:32.360
And then a quick sector review,
and bringing those all together

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:36.180
and wrapping it up

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.060
The study questions was
really about what is fintech?

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.000
And so I don't know if everybody
just wants to have an easy,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.680
hit the ball out
of the park moment.

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.570
But to you all, what is
fintech and how might it

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:50.490
shape the future?

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.640
ROMAIN: This is the last class
and your last opportunity

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:56.460
to shine, guys.

00:03:59.043 --> 00:04:01.710
GARY GENSLER: Don't you love how
Romain sort of pulls it all out

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:05.060
of you so readily, easily?

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:06.390
ROMAIN: This is the last class.

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:09.000
Danielle, go ahead.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.830
AUDIENCE: The
application of technology

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:14.610
to financial services,
and how might

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:19.737
it shape the future of money
and finance in unlimited ways.

00:04:19.737 --> 00:04:20.820
GARY GENSLER: An optimist.

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:24.110
I like that about you, Dani.

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:25.350
Unlimited ways.

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:28.453
So do you think we'll
have banks in the future?

00:04:28.453 --> 00:04:29.870
Let's go right to
the heart of it.

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.883
Will we have commercial
banks in the future?

00:04:33.883 --> 00:04:34.800
AUDIENCE: I think yes.

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.960
I think it's hard to
dislodge institutions

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.800
with that much inertia.

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.810
But they may not look
the way they look.

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:46.260
They may get
slightly more agile,

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.750
adapt, and have
digital currency.

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:52.710
They might pull in some
of the fintech disruptors.

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:54.430
So yes, we'll have
commercial banks,

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:58.188
but they may not look
precisely like they do today.

00:04:58.188 --> 00:05:00.730
GARY GENSLER: I, too, think that
we'll have commercial banks.

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:03.240
And I think it's more
than just inertia.

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.530
I think that there's certain
network effects that we've

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:11.010
seen for centuries about
bringing depositors

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:15.760
and borrowers together and
forming that intersection, sort

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.730
of like a neck of an
hourglass, but forming

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:22.930
that intersection where the
grains of sand, money and risk,

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:27.670
flow between depositors who
have money but want to save it,

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:29.960
and borrowers who
want to borrow it,

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:32.380
and the commercial banks
bring that together.

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:34.600
Peer to peer lending
has been around now

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:38.500
for some 15 years, this
concept that we don't need

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:40.840
an intermediary in the middle.

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.820
And then maybe
borrowers and lenders

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:46.140
can come together on
a technology platform.

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:49.210
And it's had some success,
not just here in the US,

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:51.970
but it started in Europe.

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:53.290
It's been here in the US.

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:58.390
It's been in China with great
numbers and some challenges

00:05:58.390 --> 00:05:59.600
as well.

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:02.500
But I think what we've seen
is, by and large, we still

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:05.200
have some centralized
marketplaces that

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:07.327
come together.

00:06:07.327 --> 00:06:09.910
Now that's not the only reason
I think commercial banking will

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:12.400
be around, but I think there
are significant network

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:17.210
effects pulling at the center.

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:21.400
How do you best assess the
viability of a fintech project?

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:23.400
ROMAIN: Carlos, you like
to take a stab at that?

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:29.330
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:33.570
So I think there's
a couple elements.

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:39.200
One is to what degree
is it an improvement

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:42.920
relative to a
traditional product?

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:45.472
How much more convenient
is it for users?

00:06:45.472 --> 00:06:46.930
And how much more
accessible is it?

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:49.790
I think those are
important factors.

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:51.540
Of course, there's a
financial liability.

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:54.150
You have to look at the actual
economics of the product

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:56.290
to see whether or not
it's scalable, above all,

00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:59.990
and whether it makes sense
to have it at a large degree.

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:03.140
And then ultimately,
I think we've

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:06.800
seen, especially
the last five years,

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:09.412
whether fintech
companies can actually

00:07:09.412 --> 00:07:11.870
become publicly owned companies,
how they handle themselves

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:13.140
in the stock market, et cetera.

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:15.473
So I think there's been several
phases to the evolution,

00:07:15.473 --> 00:07:17.040
and it's continuing.

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:20.780
GARY GENSLER: So very
helpful, in part.

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:24.380
So first Carlos said
fundamentally, you have

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:26.390
to have a value proposition.

00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:28.880
I'm using my words, but
sort of translating it,

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:30.380
if that's all right, Carlos.

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:32.540
So what pain points
are you addressing?

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:36.500
What gap in the current
system of finance?

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:39.830
And it might be about user
interface and user experience.

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:42.320
And as mobile phones
came along, as we

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:45.920
moved from online banking
and online trading

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:48.680
to mobile banking and
mobile trading that,

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:50.730
creates opportunities.

00:07:50.730 --> 00:07:53.870
Many of those opportunities
have already happened.

00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:57.410
They're not all done, but
many of those opportunities

00:07:57.410 --> 00:08:01.610
of that transition from bricks
and mortar to the internet,

00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:03.510
to mobile phones, have happened.

00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:06.650
But they create opportunities
of user experience and user

00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:07.550
interface.

00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:11.450
But it has to address some
pain point, do something

00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:13.650
quicker, cheaper, better.

00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:17.630
It's an old saw in
terms of strategy.

00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:20.480
But then Carlos is
also saying we need

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:23.990
to have financial viability.

00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:25.850
At some point in
time, you have to be

00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:29.240
able to build a model where
revenues are more than costs.

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:31.910
A lot of these startups are
looking for that sweet spot,

00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:34.820
that sort of nirvana
moment when you

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:38.030
build a platform, where platform
economics and the network

00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:39.630
effects take off.

00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:41.390
But Carlos said you
still have to have

00:08:41.390 --> 00:08:43.842
some financial viability
at some point in time.

00:08:43.842 --> 00:08:45.592
I think there was
another hand up, Romain.

00:08:48.162 --> 00:08:50.620
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I think to kind
of built on Carlos's point,

00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:54.710
another thing that might
make or break a product

00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:57.260
is potential for fraud
or the risk profile

00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:01.317
increase on a specific area.

00:09:01.317 --> 00:09:03.400
One thing we were kind of
talking about as a group

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:06.580
was alternative scoring,
and that's something

00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:08.582
that we're just
not sure if we're

00:09:08.582 --> 00:09:12.760
hot on or not just
because is taking

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:16.940
alternative data actually going
to increase or reduce risks

00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:18.175
looking forward.

00:09:18.175 --> 00:09:19.550
GARY GENSLER: So
Michael, I think

00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:21.590
what you're saying
is you still have

00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:24.470
to live within
regulatory constraints

00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:29.120
and social constraints in terms
of there's normative behavior,

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:33.350
and this is a highly regulated
field, and for good reason.

00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:35.840
We're dealing with
trust, and trust

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:37.820
is at the center of finance.

00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:40.750
We're also dealing with other
people's money and livelihood

00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:42.830
and savings and investments.

00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:44.600
And so there's
investor protection,

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:49.220
there's consumer protection, and
in terms of alternative data,

00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:51.800
the basic tenets
around the globe

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:57.050
that when you extend credit
or offer somebody insurance,

00:09:57.050 --> 00:09:59.600
it should be done
fairly and unbiased.

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:03.770
And so how do we ensure that
the use of alternative data

00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:08.750
still stays within those social
and legal norms about offering

00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:14.090
credit and insurance in
an unbiased and fair way.

00:10:14.090 --> 00:10:17.990
I think that's what you
were chatting about.

00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:18.990
AUDIENCE: Yeah, kind of.

00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:22.380
I was just thinking about, also,
the lack of adoption crypto.

00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:26.070
It's like, if it's just
going to sort of attract

00:10:26.070 --> 00:10:27.943
scammers and
fraudulent activity,

00:10:27.943 --> 00:10:30.360
the technology is going to
have a hard time being adopted.

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:30.750
GARY GENSLER: Right.

00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:31.410
Right.

00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:34.810
So of course we want to protect
against fraud in the capital

00:10:34.810 --> 00:10:35.310
markets.

00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:37.410
We also want to protect
against manipulation

00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:39.480
and ensure investment
protection.

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:41.850
And we've seen,
particularly in some fields

00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:43.710
like cryptocurrencies,
that they're

00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:48.940
rife with fraud and manipulation
and sort of quick buck artists,

00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:50.910
frankly, around the globe.

00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:54.840
And so to ensure that
any long-term viability

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:57.420
of a project, real
viability comes

00:10:57.420 --> 00:11:01.800
with investor protection,
consumer protection norms,

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:07.890
as well as norms about fairness,
inclusiveness, explainability,

00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:08.770
and the like.

00:11:08.770 --> 00:11:11.730
In most nations, these are
embedded in various regulations

00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:12.570
and laws.

00:11:12.570 --> 00:11:18.030
So standing up a new
effort, whether it's inside

00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:21.780
of an incumbent, inside
a big tech, or a startup,

00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:24.450
you've got to look at
the regulatory context.

00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:25.875
But Michael's
pointing out, also,

00:11:25.875 --> 00:11:27.250
you've got to go
a little further

00:11:27.250 --> 00:11:28.917
and make sure that
you're really serving

00:11:28.917 --> 00:11:33.150
your public and your community.

00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:35.570
And then the last question
is, I hope that we've

00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:37.560
met the goals of the class.

00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:43.940
But I do ask you today and over
the next few weeks, write me.

00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:48.470
Write me at
gensler@mit.edu and tell me

00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:50.870
what we could do better.

00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:52.610
This the first year
we've stood this up.

00:11:52.610 --> 00:11:56.090
This class is also going
to be shown publicly

00:11:56.090 --> 00:11:58.370
in MIT'S OpenCourseWare.

00:11:58.370 --> 00:12:03.470
So those of you that might
be watching this publicly,

00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:06.920
write me and tell me what we can
do in this class going forward

00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:10.340
and how we can make
it a better product.

00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:12.110
I'm kind of curious
whether it's made

00:12:12.110 --> 00:12:15.390
some folks more bullish or
more bearish on fintech,

00:12:15.390 --> 00:12:19.770
and I'm going to ask this
at the end of class as well,

00:12:19.770 --> 00:12:23.000
but if there's anybody who
wants to chat now, Romain?

00:12:26.630 --> 00:12:29.630
Anybody want to take the bullish
side or the bearish side?

00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:33.370
ROMAIN: Danielle
has her hand up.

00:12:33.370 --> 00:12:36.280
AUDIENCE: I think it depends
on which hat I have on,

00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:39.160
if I'm an investor
or entrepreneur.

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:40.840
The class has made
me more bullish.

00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:43.690
Lots of opportunities out there.

00:12:43.690 --> 00:12:48.970
If I have my citizen hat on,
I think I net out at bearish,

00:12:48.970 --> 00:12:52.660
not so much on the industry,
but more on its impact for me.

00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:54.310
I'm certainly thrilled
at the ability

00:12:54.310 --> 00:12:58.150
to access different forms
of payment and lending.

00:12:58.150 --> 00:13:00.250
But ultimately, I think
the long-term costs

00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:03.400
in terms of the data
these companies will

00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:07.310
have on me, and the
just immense role

00:13:07.310 --> 00:13:10.690
and control over my life,
I net out at bearish.

00:13:10.690 --> 00:13:12.190
And then if I'm
the government, I'm

00:13:12.190 --> 00:13:14.357
probably netting out at
bearish as well because this

00:13:14.357 --> 00:13:19.030
is going to mean a gnarly
set of regulations and laws

00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:22.360
to navigate that means
a lot more work for me.

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:24.620
GARY GENSLER: Very interesting,
very nuanced answer.

00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:26.590
I see some other hands up.

00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:27.593
ROMAIN: Celi?

00:13:33.327 --> 00:13:35.410
GARY GENSLER: Maybe you've
got your mute on still.

00:13:35.410 --> 00:13:36.702
ROMAIN: Yes, we can't hear you.

00:13:39.290 --> 00:13:39.790
OK.

00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:43.675
Then let's move on to Lamide.

00:13:43.675 --> 00:13:44.300
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:46.880
I'm more bullish.

00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:49.310
For me one of the
interesting trends

00:13:49.310 --> 00:13:51.280
I see is serving
the underserved,

00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:55.460
whether that's in crypto trying
to serve the population that

00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:58.437
doesn't have to be VC, or
whether it's in insurance.

00:13:58.437 --> 00:14:00.020
you have all these
trends where people

00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:03.680
are getting more nuanced
products to really target

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:05.740
populations that
are underserved.

00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:09.520
And all these different kind
of new innovations around that

00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:12.000
inspire me.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:17.330
GARY GENSLER: So we've
got bullish as an investor

00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:18.470
from Dani.

00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:23.630
We've got bullish for economic
inclusion and product inclusion

00:14:23.630 --> 00:14:25.880
just now from Lamide.

00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:28.310
But there were some
bearishness from Dani

00:14:28.310 --> 00:14:32.930
on data and the industry
knowing so much more about us.

00:14:32.930 --> 00:14:37.760
Was there anybody else,
Romain, that wanted to add in?

00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:40.677
ROMAIN: Maybe Celi, if her
microphone works, and Luke.

00:14:40.677 --> 00:14:41.510
GARY GENSLER: Right.

00:14:41.510 --> 00:14:42.468
And then we'll move on.

00:14:42.468 --> 00:14:44.909
We'll take Luke and Celi.

00:14:44.909 --> 00:14:46.240
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:48.190
My internet connection's poor.

00:14:48.190 --> 00:14:51.070
But I think I'd like to echo--

00:14:51.070 --> 00:14:57.760
I missed part of Lamide's but my
thing was financial inclusion.

00:14:57.760 --> 00:15:01.760
So really entering,
I think, also, it's

00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:05.610
in the benefit of
the government, too.

00:15:05.610 --> 00:15:09.220
I know that there are
some concerns there,

00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:11.650
but I think if you're
thinking about it

00:15:11.650 --> 00:15:13.660
from an economic
growth perspective,

00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:16.480
there's a lot of
opportunity through fintech

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:20.420
that would end up really
benefit the entire economy.

00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:24.160
So I think that there's the
argument for the government

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:27.220
to have interest and to be
a more bullish approach as

00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:31.490
well, even though there
are risks involved.

00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:33.440
GARY GENSLER: So you
accept a little bit

00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:36.020
what Dani was saying
that for the government,

00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:40.490
the official sector, some of the
challenges, to use her words,

00:15:40.490 --> 00:15:42.560
were gnarly.

00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:45.320
But though there's challenges,
you think to the extent

00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:48.050
that it promotes inclusion
and economic activity,

00:15:48.050 --> 00:15:51.750
that innovation is a net
good, and competition,

00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:53.600
if I can insert something.

00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:56.930
What fintech does is it
provides an opportunity

00:15:56.930 --> 00:16:01.960
both for incumbents and
startups and big competitors

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:05.170
like big tech to start to
bring competitive challenges.

00:16:05.170 --> 00:16:08.140
We saw this in China
when Ally Pay and WeChat

00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:14.230
Pay bring economic challenges
to the banking sector

00:16:14.230 --> 00:16:17.300
and now dominate the
retail payment space.

00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:20.440
But for a while, all
of that inclusion

00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:22.990
creates economic opportunity.

00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:25.360
I say for a while because
at some point in time,

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:30.040
then they too become
a bit of an oligopoly.

00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:34.180
And they can charge, over
time, economic rents.

00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:36.760
But that has certainly
brought a lot of inclusion,

00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:40.360
a lot of growth, a lot
of economic opportunity

00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:42.970
to underserved
populations, in that case,

00:16:42.970 --> 00:16:45.130
in China and elsewhere in Asia.

00:16:45.130 --> 00:16:48.940
We've also seen that
across the US and in Europe

00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:54.400
with competition from challenger
banks and neo banks and payment

00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:59.080
companies, long ago, like PayPal
started 20 years ago, or more

00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:02.710
recently, by many of the payment
innovators in this space,

00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:05.950
whether they're data
aggregators or direct payment

00:17:05.950 --> 00:17:09.160
solutions like Toast in
the restaurant business.

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:11.780
But as Dani said
also, the Plaids,

00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:15.220
which are the data aggregators,
or even the Credit Karmas

00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:19.270
giving us free access
to our credit reports,

00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:22.210
or Robin Hood giving
us free access

00:17:22.210 --> 00:17:24.880
to trading online
brokerage, also

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:27.589
then are collecting
significant amount of data.

00:17:27.589 --> 00:17:29.770
And whether they're
commercializing that data

00:17:29.770 --> 00:17:34.180
in ways we understand,
appreciate, and want,

00:17:34.180 --> 00:17:36.280
Dani is sort of
raising that makes her

00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:38.250
a little uncomfortable as well.

00:17:38.250 --> 00:17:41.720
And I think we were going
to close it out with Luke.

00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:44.770
AUDIENCE: So I'm
bullish in the long term

00:17:44.770 --> 00:17:48.020
in the sense that two
conditions are met,

00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:51.530
the convenience and then
technology acceptance in terms

00:17:51.530 --> 00:17:53.250
of blockchain.

00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:54.800
You teach blockchain and money.

00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:59.000
And if people accept blockchain
as technology as core

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.510
to fintech, it has
a lot of potentials.

00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:08.120
If not, this is nothing more
than making any status quo

00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:11.790
industry more convenient
and more accessible.

00:18:11.790 --> 00:18:13.113
So little bearish.

00:18:13.113 --> 00:18:14.780
GARY GENSLER: So
you're bullish, and one

00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:18.440
of the reasons you're bullish
is you feel the blockchain

00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:23.870
technology is a positive.

00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:25.490
And is that positive
because you feel

00:18:25.490 --> 00:18:27.980
it's pushing at the
side of central banks,

00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:31.700
pushing at the side of
central payment processors

00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:35.210
and the rest of finance,
which I would share that view.

00:18:35.210 --> 00:18:36.920
I think it's a catalyst.

00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:40.430
And it's part of why we've
seen a lot of innovation.

00:18:40.430 --> 00:18:44.120
Even our US Federal
Reserve, who was thinking

00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:48.050
about doing 24 hour a day, seven
days a week payment systems,

00:18:48.050 --> 00:18:50.120
is rolling out something
called Fed Now.

00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:53.990
I think that's in part because
of this catalyst for change.

00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:58.220
But do you also think that it
will be a mainstream product

00:18:58.220 --> 00:19:00.770
offering, and that
blockchain technology will

00:19:00.770 --> 00:19:07.400
roll into what I call the
technology stack in finance?

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:09.130
AUDIENCE: Well, I
believe in evolution,

00:19:09.130 --> 00:19:12.950
so in 10 years or whatever
years that may take,

00:19:12.950 --> 00:19:14.960
this is indeed the
best technology

00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:16.610
if everyone accepts it.

00:19:16.610 --> 00:19:17.570
So I don't see why not.

00:19:17.570 --> 00:19:19.910
However, it will take
a tremendous amount

00:19:19.910 --> 00:19:23.120
of time and energy and
effort for everyone

00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:25.080
to accept it and understand it.

00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:26.960
Either it takes a
crisis or it takes

00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:28.698
governmental intervention.

00:19:28.698 --> 00:19:29.990
GARY GENSLER: You may be right.

00:19:29.990 --> 00:19:32.960
I still haven't been convinced,
but you may be right.

00:19:36.265 --> 00:19:38.930
I'm sort of a
middle of the road.

00:19:38.930 --> 00:19:41.190
I'm neither a minimalist
or a maximalist

00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:42.650
on blockchain technology.

00:19:42.650 --> 00:19:46.250
But it hasn't yet because
of the dominant challenges

00:19:46.250 --> 00:19:47.070
of governance.

00:19:47.070 --> 00:19:50.630
How do you have multiple
parties sharing a ledger?

00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:53.070
And these issues of
governance are not new.

00:19:53.070 --> 00:19:57.260
They're just in this context
of blockchain technology.

00:19:57.260 --> 00:20:01.850
But the opportunity to have a
new data structure, a shared

00:20:01.850 --> 00:20:04.970
data structure amongst
multiple parties,

00:20:04.970 --> 00:20:09.140
I think you're probably right,
will come into use somewhere.

00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:11.660
The question is how
broadly because you

00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:15.140
have at the center a really--

00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:17.290
Dani used the word
gnarly, but maybe

00:20:17.290 --> 00:20:20.270
if I use that here, gnarly
set of governance issues,

00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:23.840
how you have a shared data
structure, a shared ledger.

00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:26.210
And then, of course,
in cryptocurrencies

00:20:26.210 --> 00:20:28.270
is another set of challenges.

00:20:28.270 --> 00:20:31.620
Is a private sector
currency needed?

00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:34.000
Well, if fiat currencies
are well managed,

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.380
if monetary policy
and fiscal policies

00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:38.990
are well managed, probably not.

00:20:38.990 --> 00:20:42.560
But then again, the history of
nations, the history of finance

00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:48.140
and money of 200 countries,
there tends to be one to three

00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:50.780
at any given time that
aren't managing their fiat

00:20:50.780 --> 00:20:52.040
currencies well.

00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:53.930
So there you have it.

00:20:53.930 --> 00:20:55.070
AUDIENCE: One last notice.

00:20:55.070 --> 00:20:58.880
Only when governments' interest
aligns with the blockchain,

00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:02.110
because fiat currency's
centralized and blockchain is

00:21:02.110 --> 00:21:07.260
decentralized, would we have a
wide acceptance of blockchain,

00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:07.760
correct?

00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:09.177
GARY GENSLER:
That's a good point,

00:21:09.177 --> 00:21:13.820
that the sovereign
currency is probably here

00:21:13.820 --> 00:21:17.180
unless there's
some collaboration

00:21:17.180 --> 00:21:20.780
between the central authorities
and the use of that technology

00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:22.770
is your point.

00:21:22.770 --> 00:21:25.250
So we're going to
dive in a little bit.

00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:27.140
And just sort of
summarizing, I talk

00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:30.260
about the technology stack.

00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:32.300
And the cloud,
mobile, the internet

00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:36.140
were important parts that were
added to the finance technology

00:21:36.140 --> 00:21:40.250
stack, really, from the
1990s all the way till now.

00:21:40.250 --> 00:21:44.560
And if you look at
big finance, all

00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:47.110
using the internet, of
course, from the late '90s,

00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:49.480
and into the naughts,
all pretty much

00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:53.530
rolling out mobile applications,
particularly in the last 10

00:21:53.530 --> 00:21:58.420
years, often because of the
pressures from startups.

00:21:58.420 --> 00:22:02.230
Not so much all have
rolled in the cloud.

00:22:02.230 --> 00:22:05.290
And many big finance
companies are still having

00:22:05.290 --> 00:22:07.810
their centralized
data structures.

00:22:07.810 --> 00:22:09.640
But more and more
are using the cloud.

00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:11.200
What's important
about the cloud,

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:15.310
though, is that it gives
startups a real chance

00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:18.610
to sort of rent versus bill.

00:22:18.610 --> 00:22:21.580
So you don't have to build
your own data structure,

00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:26.110
put it in Microsoft Azure,
put it in an Amazon AWS,

00:22:26.110 --> 00:22:29.870
put it in [INAUDIBLE]
equivalents and so forth.

00:22:29.870 --> 00:22:32.860
So those were all earlier
technologies fully

00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:35.240
in the finance technology stack.

00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:37.840
But we've talked a lot
about in this class machine

00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:40.050
learning, natural
language processing,

00:22:40.050 --> 00:22:44.090
the critical pieces,
really, in the last call it

00:22:44.090 --> 00:22:49.330
seven to 10 years, that
computational power

00:22:49.330 --> 00:22:55.390
and the ability to analyze
data and extract correlations.

00:22:55.390 --> 00:22:59.440
And what machine learning
at its core does best,

00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:03.100
it's remarkable at extracting
correlations, pattern

00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:05.000
recognition, if you wish.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:08.440
And that pattern
recognition on data

00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:11.570
has started to really be
important in this field.

00:23:11.570 --> 00:23:13.320
And we'll talk a little
bit more about it.

00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:17.620
But it's also access to
data and digital interfaces

00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:23.010
through open application
program interfaces, or API.

00:23:23.010 --> 00:23:25.680
And you could have machine
learning and natural language

00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:28.890
processing without
open API, but open API

00:23:28.890 --> 00:23:30.790
is a really important
piece of this,

00:23:30.790 --> 00:23:34.660
particularly as startups
try to get into this space.

00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:36.750
And as we talked
about, some of that's

00:23:36.750 --> 00:23:40.440
because the official sector
says, thou shall do this.

00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:44.310
Some of it is technologically
facilitated by companies

00:23:44.310 --> 00:23:46.530
that provided that access.

00:23:46.530 --> 00:23:52.050
And then many of the incumbents
wanted to provide it as well.

00:23:52.050 --> 00:23:53.940
And then, of course,
there's a whole bunch

00:23:53.940 --> 00:23:55.940
of things that have been
in the technology stack

00:23:55.940 --> 00:23:57.710
for decades or centuries.

00:23:57.710 --> 00:23:59.840
We took those as givens.

00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:02.480
And I think at some
point, when this course is

00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:05.480
taught in the 2030s,
machine learning

00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:07.460
will just be taken as a given.

00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:09.320
Open API will be a
given, and there'll

00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:11.720
be new technologies beyond that.

00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:15.320
Now we talked about one
that's really in insurance.

00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:17.360
And I kid the class a
little bit because I

00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:20.840
know the interest has been more
in payments and in challenger

00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:22.810
banks and neo banks.

00:24:22.810 --> 00:24:26.540
But why I find insurance
so interesting is it's

00:24:26.540 --> 00:24:29.820
starting to layer a new
technology into the technology

00:24:29.820 --> 00:24:30.320
stack.

00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:35.150
We don't see this as much in the
challenger banks and in credit.

00:24:35.150 --> 00:24:40.210
But sensor data, telematics
in the automobiles,

00:24:40.210 --> 00:24:42.640
wearables and the like.

00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:46.840
All that remarkable amount of
data to assess and underwrite

00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:49.870
insurance risk, whether
it's on an automobile,

00:24:49.870 --> 00:24:52.750
whether it's on
a home, will that

00:24:52.750 --> 00:24:56.650
come into the technology
stack of banks and credit card

00:24:56.650 --> 00:24:57.580
companies?

00:24:57.580 --> 00:25:00.630
We haven't yet seen it.

00:25:00.630 --> 00:25:05.390
But other than sort of social
norms and regulatory reasons,

00:25:05.390 --> 00:25:09.350
why wouldn't we see that wealth
of data from your automobile,

00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:14.330
from your wearables, from
Internet of Things sensors

00:25:14.330 --> 00:25:18.310
wouldn't start to
influence, and one

00:25:18.310 --> 00:25:21.910
might say infiltrate, into
how credit decisions are

00:25:21.910 --> 00:25:26.390
made, again, within the
regulatory construct

00:25:26.390 --> 00:25:27.290
and so forth.

00:25:27.290 --> 00:25:30.550
So one of the reasons why I
find insurance so fascinating,

00:25:30.550 --> 00:25:33.370
because there's sort
of another technology

00:25:33.370 --> 00:25:35.680
that they're starting
to use to collect data.

00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:37.280
Really important.

00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:39.340
And then lastly,
we've talked a lot

00:25:39.340 --> 00:25:41.050
about blockchain technology.

00:25:41.050 --> 00:25:42.830
I teach it as well.

00:25:42.830 --> 00:25:44.470
I find it a fascinating area.

00:25:44.470 --> 00:25:47.290
But just as that back
and forth with Luke,

00:25:47.290 --> 00:25:48.550
I put question marks.

00:25:48.550 --> 00:25:51.490
Will it come into that
full technology stack?

00:25:51.490 --> 00:25:53.830
It's most definitely been
a catalyst for change.

00:25:53.830 --> 00:25:57.370
It's pushing at the
edges of finance.

00:25:57.370 --> 00:26:00.880
It's starting to make each
institution, whether it's

00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:03.700
JP Morgan thinking
about a new way

00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:06.640
to do payments with
something called JP Morgan

00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:10.300
Coin, or a whole collection
of incumbent banks

00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:17.250
around a project called Finality
or utility settlement coin.

00:26:17.250 --> 00:26:20.410
We have, of course,
seen how Facebook

00:26:20.410 --> 00:26:24.130
caught a great deal of
attention in 2019 and 2020

00:26:24.130 --> 00:26:26.320
with their Facebook
Libra project,

00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:30.370
a consortium to roll out
a new global currency,

00:26:30.370 --> 00:26:33.680
both multi-basket
and single currency.

00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:37.810
So incumbents in big tech are
taking very close look at this.

00:26:37.810 --> 00:26:39.700
And then you have the
Central Bank of China,

00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:42.070
People's Bank of
China doing something

00:26:42.070 --> 00:26:46.900
called a digital currency
electronic payments program.

00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:48.820
It's not using
blockchain technology.

00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:52.060
But for sure it's inspired
by cryptocurrencies.

00:26:52.060 --> 00:26:58.090
It's for sure put a higher
emphasis for all central banks

00:26:58.090 --> 00:27:00.970
around the globe to consider
what's called central bank

00:27:00.970 --> 00:27:02.660
digital currencies.

00:27:02.660 --> 00:27:05.170
So I put some question marks
because we know it's already

00:27:05.170 --> 00:27:07.960
been a catalyst for change,
but will it actually

00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:11.130
be incorporated in
the technology stack?

00:27:11.130 --> 00:27:12.850
Romain, any questions?

00:27:16.430 --> 00:27:18.270
ROMAIN: Let's wait
just another second.

00:27:18.270 --> 00:27:18.830
Yes, Hassan.

00:27:23.005 --> 00:27:23.630
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:27:23.630 --> 00:27:24.588
I just have a question.

00:27:24.588 --> 00:27:27.400
Now at the beginning
of the slide,

00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:31.060
you said internet,
mobile, and the cloud.

00:27:31.060 --> 00:27:32.380
What do you mean exactly?

00:27:32.380 --> 00:27:34.600
I mean, did it move
from internet to cloud,

00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:38.470
or is is just like
a new technology?

00:27:38.470 --> 00:27:39.520
What do you mean?

00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:42.280
GARY GENSLER: I'm sure-- because
your voice is fading out--

00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:45.160
are you asking whether I think
these are new technologies?

00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:48.130
I think they were new
when they rolled out

00:27:48.130 --> 00:27:51.640
the internet fundamentally
in the mid- to late '90s

00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:54.760
for most of finance
had to take notice.

00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:58.390
But I assure you, having
lived it, in the early '90s,

00:27:58.390 --> 00:28:01.840
the internet was not in
the technology stack,

00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:05.830
meaning most of big finance
and startups of the time

00:28:05.830 --> 00:28:07.120
didn't use it.

00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:10.990
But many of the startups
by the late '90s had to.

00:28:10.990 --> 00:28:16.450
Amazon started in 1995, and they
embedded the internet in it.

00:28:16.450 --> 00:28:21.010
Of course, it was what
made Amazon so successful.

00:28:21.010 --> 00:28:27.370
PayPal started in 1997
or 1998, for instance.

00:28:27.370 --> 00:28:31.310
Now you can't survive if
you don't use the internet.

00:28:31.310 --> 00:28:32.870
So that's what I'm saying there.

00:28:32.870 --> 00:28:35.510
And mobile phones similarly.

00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:41.570
By and large, finance, at first,
was providing things online,

00:28:41.570 --> 00:28:44.270
or shall I say, on
the internet, but not

00:28:44.270 --> 00:28:46.280
necessarily on a mobile app.

00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:50.720
And the first mobile apps were
fundamentally just the same

00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:53.360
that you could do
online, and then you

00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:56.960
had to give a better user
interface, more adaptable,

00:28:56.960 --> 00:28:59.990
in essence, something
for the small screen

00:28:59.990 --> 00:29:03.380
that our fingers can do easily
and readily on this rather than

00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:04.830
on a laptop.

00:29:04.830 --> 00:29:08.390
So I'm saying that
today, whether you're

00:29:08.390 --> 00:29:12.220
big tech, big
finance, or a startup,

00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:13.870
you have to do these things.

00:29:13.870 --> 00:29:18.370
You have to do them well or you
can't compete fundamentally.

00:29:18.370 --> 00:29:22.292
But maybe I didn't understand
the question, Hassan.

00:29:22.292 --> 00:29:24.000
AUDIENCE: I mean, when
you move to cloud,

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:29.110
is it like supporting
the mobile application,

00:29:29.110 --> 00:29:32.018
or does it have a different use?

00:29:32.018 --> 00:29:34.060
GARY GENSLER: I think it
does a number of things.

00:29:34.060 --> 00:29:34.850
Great question.

00:29:34.850 --> 00:29:39.850
The cloud, I think,
facilitates greater competition

00:29:39.850 --> 00:29:45.580
both as a support function
and also a cost function.

00:29:45.580 --> 00:29:47.530
A lot of finance is about trust.

00:29:47.530 --> 00:29:50.650
Embedded in finance is
trust, and we give data

00:29:50.650 --> 00:29:52.540
to financial firms.

00:29:52.540 --> 00:29:54.590
We want that data
to be protected.

00:29:54.590 --> 00:29:57.520
Now earlier Dani
raised the underbelly

00:29:57.520 --> 00:29:59.350
about how they use the data.

00:29:59.350 --> 00:30:00.980
But we want to protect it.

00:30:00.980 --> 00:30:05.050
So by using the cloud,
any financial competitor

00:30:05.050 --> 00:30:09.250
can better insure
for cyber security.

00:30:09.250 --> 00:30:13.990
One of the dominant things about
the cloud is it can lower cost.

00:30:13.990 --> 00:30:17.530
It can provide a standardized
form of data security or cyber

00:30:17.530 --> 00:30:19.140
security.

00:30:19.140 --> 00:30:23.830
And I think it somewhat levels
the field of competition.

00:30:23.830 --> 00:30:25.300
But it's a supporting role.

00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:25.930
You're right.

00:30:25.930 --> 00:30:30.490
It's not something, necessarily,
that's there for the users,

00:30:30.490 --> 00:30:33.070
for you and me to see.

00:30:33.070 --> 00:30:36.370
But we couldn't
use Credit Karma,

00:30:36.370 --> 00:30:38.830
we couldn't use Robin
Hood, we couldn't

00:30:38.830 --> 00:30:43.660
use many of the insurance apps
if those venture capitalists

00:30:43.660 --> 00:30:46.930
and entrepreneurs behind it had
decided to build their own data

00:30:46.930 --> 00:30:47.573
centers.

00:30:47.573 --> 00:30:49.240
They wouldn't have
been able to stand up

00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:52.730
with the same scalability
and same time frames

00:30:52.730 --> 00:30:54.560
at the same costs.

00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:58.610
So it's facilitated a tremendous
amount of competition.

00:30:58.610 --> 00:31:00.560
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:02.960
GARY GENSLER: So sometimes
in infrastructure technology,

00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:06.110
I might consider the cloud
an infrastructure technology

00:31:06.110 --> 00:31:08.960
rather than a user
facing technology.

00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:10.940
But as an infrastructure
technology,

00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:12.502
it's darn important.

00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:19.780
And so in that context,
I've also sort of said,

00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:23.820
well, there's the customer
interface and chat

00:31:23.820 --> 00:31:26.550
bots and open API
or what we've been

00:31:26.550 --> 00:31:29.340
talking about in this class.

00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:31.650
But it all builds on
that which came right

00:31:31.650 --> 00:31:35.720
before it, mobile phones, the
internet, as we just said.

00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:39.950
And we've dominantly focused
on customer interface and risk

00:31:39.950 --> 00:31:40.580
management.

00:31:40.580 --> 00:31:42.350
Risk management,
what we've focused

00:31:42.350 --> 00:31:46.790
on in this class, machine
learning dominantly, sensors

00:31:46.790 --> 00:31:49.520
and telematics in
the insurance field,

00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:53.080
peer to peer lending is in
the risk management side.

00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:54.920
But all of this
built, and could not

00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:57.980
have been built without the
asset-backed securitization.

00:31:57.980 --> 00:32:00.500
And like the cloud
earlier, Hassan,

00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:03.800
if I can use that, the
cloud is an infrastructure

00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:07.580
technology, the technology
of risk management,

00:32:07.580 --> 00:32:11.000
that you could take a pool of
mortgages, a pool of credit

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:14.510
card receivables, a
pool of auto loans,

00:32:14.510 --> 00:32:19.670
and take those and sell them
into the securities markets,

00:32:19.670 --> 00:32:22.040
has facilitated a
number of startups

00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:24.980
to say, look, I don't
need to use balance sheet.

00:32:24.980 --> 00:32:31.120
I can maybe sell these pool
of receivables and loans

00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:32.350
into the marketplace.

00:32:32.350 --> 00:32:36.070
I could be more like a
broker, more on the front end,

00:32:36.070 --> 00:32:38.380
and give great
customer interface,

00:32:38.380 --> 00:32:40.250
and then sell into the market.

00:32:40.250 --> 00:32:43.630
So some risk
management tools that

00:32:43.630 --> 00:32:46.550
were inventions and new
technologies of the 1970s

00:32:46.550 --> 00:32:52.640
to the 1990s allows,
then, this build here.

00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:57.010
And so one of the central
themes of this class that I want

00:32:57.010 --> 00:32:58.840
you to take away
is not necessarily

00:32:58.840 --> 00:33:03.160
how machine learning works, not
necessarily how open API works,

00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:07.930
but how new technologies
come along in the past,

00:33:07.930 --> 00:33:09.400
and they will in the future--

00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:11.600
every five to 15
years there's going

00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:14.650
to be some new technology.

00:33:14.650 --> 00:33:16.780
We seven billion
humans haven't stopped

00:33:16.780 --> 00:33:19.420
coming up with
innovations that are

00:33:19.420 --> 00:33:21.370
relevant to the
financial world--

00:33:21.370 --> 00:33:27.380
and as they do, think about
how it opens a crack, how

00:33:27.380 --> 00:33:30.450
it creates an opportunity.

00:33:30.450 --> 00:33:32.060
And if you're at
a big incumbent,

00:33:32.060 --> 00:33:35.620
if you're a Bank of
America or Mitsui Bank,

00:33:35.620 --> 00:33:38.120
think about how it's going to
create an opportunity not only

00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:40.880
for you, but your competitors.

00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:44.300
And if you don't act upon that
new technology, somebody will.

00:33:44.300 --> 00:33:51.080
There'll be a new Transferwise
or Revolut or a Robin Hood

00:33:51.080 --> 00:33:55.700
or Ally Pay that comes along
to use that technology.

00:33:55.700 --> 00:33:57.980
And I think they
will be dominantly

00:33:57.980 --> 00:34:02.280
in these two areas,
customer interface

00:34:02.280 --> 00:34:03.870
and in risk management.

00:34:03.870 --> 00:34:06.480
But just like the cloud
there could be also things

00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:08.600
that are pure infrastructure.

00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:10.710
And the cloud
created opportunity

00:34:10.710 --> 00:34:14.170
and moved finance along.

00:34:14.170 --> 00:34:17.429
So that's kind of the central
sort of conceptual framework

00:34:17.429 --> 00:34:20.020
that I bring to this.

00:34:20.020 --> 00:34:23.730
And I think that finance
has a fertile ground.

00:34:23.730 --> 00:34:26.940
And the important
opportunities in finance,

00:34:26.940 --> 00:34:28.260
digitization of money.

00:34:28.260 --> 00:34:31.219
Money is now electronic.

00:34:31.219 --> 00:34:34.040
Money itself is but
a social construct.

00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:37.130
But we used to think
about it in physical ways.

00:34:37.130 --> 00:34:40.969
Before a few decades ago, it was
all really physical paper money

00:34:40.969 --> 00:34:42.830
or gold or silver.

00:34:42.830 --> 00:34:43.639
But frankly.

00:34:43.639 --> 00:34:45.050
We're in the 2020s.

00:34:45.050 --> 00:34:47.960
We're living through
this coronavirus crisis.

00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:50.659
We will have accentuated that.

00:34:50.659 --> 00:34:53.310
There's a wide public
acceptance of new tech.

00:34:53.310 --> 00:34:57.460
And each time there's a new
tech, a new way to interface,

00:34:57.460 --> 00:35:01.420
though finance is
a world of trust,

00:35:01.420 --> 00:35:06.510
we tend to have a lot of
trust in new technology.

00:35:06.510 --> 00:35:08.940
Now often it's the
new generation.

00:35:08.940 --> 00:35:13.290
It's going to be the Gen
Zs and the Millennials

00:35:13.290 --> 00:35:16.850
before it's going to be
folks of my generation.

00:35:16.850 --> 00:35:19.190
But there's still a wide
acceptance of new tech.

00:35:19.190 --> 00:35:21.950
Look at all of us in
the coronavirus crisis

00:35:21.950 --> 00:35:23.870
using Zoom and online.

00:35:23.870 --> 00:35:26.240
It's not as good as
being in the classroom.

00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:28.760
I have to tell you
this is definitely not

00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:30.410
as good as being
in the classroom,

00:35:30.410 --> 00:35:33.410
but we're learning how
to use this new tech.

00:35:33.410 --> 00:35:36.080
And the interface and
the processing systems

00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:41.450
of the legacy incumbents leaves
opportunities for competition.

00:35:41.450 --> 00:35:44.100
And of course, we've
talked about data.

00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:47.125
I'm pausing, Romain, in
case there are questions.

00:35:49.652 --> 00:35:51.360
ROMAIN: Let's give it
a few more seconds.

00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:52.568
We have a question from Luke.

00:35:54.648 --> 00:35:55.690
AUDIENCE: Quick question.

00:35:55.690 --> 00:35:58.000
What do you think about
encrypting the tech to money

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:03.070
via blockchain so that
we can kind of see where

00:36:03.070 --> 00:36:09.070
the public money is spent, i.e.

00:36:09.070 --> 00:36:11.350
Korea is actually trying
to think about doing that.

00:36:11.350 --> 00:36:13.540
You mentioned China is
thinking about doing that.

00:36:13.540 --> 00:36:17.410
This is more possible in more
of the East Asian countries

00:36:17.410 --> 00:36:20.260
versus very, very
high individual rights

00:36:20.260 --> 00:36:24.643
countries such as the US where
they might be allergic to it.

00:36:24.643 --> 00:36:26.560
GARY GENSLER: So you've
embedded a whole bunch

00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:27.730
of parts in there.

00:36:27.730 --> 00:36:34.420
But let me just say
blockchain technology has

00:36:34.420 --> 00:36:37.780
a positive attribute that
it's a shared public ledger.

00:36:37.780 --> 00:36:42.250
On some level, you can make
data on that ledger public.

00:36:42.250 --> 00:36:46.570
You can also encrypt it and
make it not necessarily public.

00:36:46.570 --> 00:36:49.510
So it depends on
the architecture.

00:36:49.510 --> 00:36:54.850
But a blockchain technology
with a shared ledger

00:36:54.850 --> 00:36:57.700
is what often is called
tamper resistant.

00:36:57.700 --> 00:36:59.260
Tamper resistant,
some people say

00:36:59.260 --> 00:37:02.470
immutable, which isn't
quite technically correct.

00:37:02.470 --> 00:37:06.640
And so a government, or
even a private sector firm,

00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:12.700
could use it to say
that's a record of truth.

00:37:12.700 --> 00:37:17.440
That's a record that
is tamper resistant.

00:37:17.440 --> 00:37:21.580
I haven't seen any
government doing that yet.

00:37:21.580 --> 00:37:23.420
But it certainly can be done.

00:37:23.420 --> 00:37:25.750
It's been done more
in the private sector.

00:37:25.750 --> 00:37:27.580
You'd still have to
trust in the protocol.

00:37:27.580 --> 00:37:31.570
You'd have to trust in whatever
nodes or network maintain

00:37:31.570 --> 00:37:33.130
that ledger.

00:37:33.130 --> 00:37:34.930
But it's a possibility
going forward.

00:37:37.490 --> 00:37:39.250
So who are the
actors in fintech?

00:37:39.250 --> 00:37:41.600
Who are the broad actors?

00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:42.850
Well, we've talked about them.

00:37:42.850 --> 00:37:45.700
Big finance, I like to
quote the Central Bank

00:37:45.700 --> 00:37:48.190
governor of Brazil,
who gave me this little

00:37:48.190 --> 00:37:51.160
saying where he said, big
finance is like fortresses.

00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:55.390
They have moats and towers
and sovereign affiliations.

00:37:55.390 --> 00:37:58.030
And I mean, it breaks
down a little bit, too.

00:37:58.030 --> 00:38:00.160
But it has some apt
parts of it, being

00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:03.820
the towers are big finance
are dominant in payments.

00:38:03.820 --> 00:38:05.230
They have their balance sheets.

00:38:05.230 --> 00:38:07.540
They, too, collect
data, and they're

00:38:07.540 --> 00:38:09.940
vast corporate
structures, often,

00:38:09.940 --> 00:38:14.390
of 1,000 to 5,000 legal
entities around the globe.

00:38:14.390 --> 00:38:16.270
But there's challenges
to big finance,

00:38:16.270 --> 00:38:19.090
particularly in payments,
and some of them

00:38:19.090 --> 00:38:21.070
are now even
incumbents themselves

00:38:21.070 --> 00:38:25.120
like Pay Pal and Square
and Stripe and the like.

00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:27.630
Startups of just 10
and 20 years ago,

00:38:27.630 --> 00:38:30.530
now they feel a little bit
like incumbents as well.

00:38:30.530 --> 00:38:33.430
But I think big finance, as
we talked earlier with Dani,

00:38:33.430 --> 00:38:35.440
I think big finance,
we will still

00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:38.850
have banks in 10 and
30 years because there

00:38:38.850 --> 00:38:44.050
is network economics
around balance sheets.

00:38:44.050 --> 00:38:49.750
Any study of diversification
would tell you

00:38:49.750 --> 00:38:53.120
if you have a balance sheet that
has thousands of loans on it

00:38:53.120 --> 00:38:57.370
rather than a single loan,
you can lower the risk just

00:38:57.370 --> 00:39:00.910
through the diversification of
the underwriting and the risk

00:39:00.910 --> 00:39:02.290
allocation.

00:39:02.290 --> 00:39:05.230
Also, big finance has data.

00:39:05.230 --> 00:39:07.150
But there's challenges
to big finance

00:39:07.150 --> 00:39:10.000
for sure from big tech, and
the Bank of International

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:15.040
Settlement talks about big
tech in terms of data networks

00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:16.180
and activities.

00:39:16.180 --> 00:39:18.700
Now the data is a little
different than big finance

00:39:18.700 --> 00:39:22.160
because it includes data
outside of the financial world.

00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:25.300
So they get a picture
on all of our activity

00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:27.100
in a different way.

00:39:27.100 --> 00:39:32.590
Google has Google Chrome, it
has Google Maps, it has Gmail.

00:39:32.590 --> 00:39:36.580
It has so many ways
to assess data.

00:39:36.580 --> 00:39:42.310
Phone companies like Apple have
a lot of sensor data as well.

00:39:42.310 --> 00:39:45.700
That sensor data is currently
being used in insurance.

00:39:45.700 --> 00:39:48.640
But will it start to be
used in credit and payment

00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:50.690
systems and the like?

00:39:50.690 --> 00:39:51.760
And then the startups.

00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:53.950
And I don't count
the startups out,

00:39:53.950 --> 00:39:57.070
but I think to think about
fintech just about startups

00:39:57.070 --> 00:39:59.380
is too narrow, and
it's why I think

00:39:59.380 --> 00:40:02.530
of fintech around these
three sets of actors.

00:40:02.530 --> 00:40:05.250
But startups,
disruptive innovators,

00:40:05.250 --> 00:40:12.040
if you throw up 100 finance
startups or fintech startups,

00:40:12.040 --> 00:40:14.950
two to five of them are
just going to break through.

00:40:14.950 --> 00:40:16.810
I mean, there's
some odds to this

00:40:16.810 --> 00:40:18.850
that some will break through.

00:40:18.850 --> 00:40:20.480
And they have
flexibility, and they're

00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:23.000
a bit of asymmetric risk takers.

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:26.980
They don't have business
models to support and protect.

00:40:26.980 --> 00:40:31.270
And often big finance is
protecting a business model.

00:40:31.270 --> 00:40:34.060
Credit cards in the
US are dominated

00:40:34.060 --> 00:40:35.590
by seven big companies.

00:40:35.590 --> 00:40:39.430
And those seven big companies
that dominate in the US,

00:40:39.430 --> 00:40:42.010
they want to protect some
of their profit and revenue

00:40:42.010 --> 00:40:43.150
models.

00:40:43.150 --> 00:40:46.420
And so that gives an opportunity
for companies like Toast

00:40:46.420 --> 00:40:50.380
to get into the
restaurant business.

00:40:50.380 --> 00:40:52.090
It's a little harder
for a big actor

00:40:52.090 --> 00:40:55.750
to go into those individual
sectors and the like.

00:40:55.750 --> 00:40:57.610
They also have a bit
of asymmetric risk

00:40:57.610 --> 00:40:59.530
as it relates to
regulation, and this is

00:40:59.530 --> 00:41:01.600
what Dani was saying earlier.

00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:03.730
It's neither good nor bad.

00:41:03.730 --> 00:41:08.260
It's just an observation
that startups often

00:41:08.260 --> 00:41:12.940
have a little bit of an
attitude as try it out.

00:41:12.940 --> 00:41:15.910
If it breaks some rules
somewhere, clean it up.

00:41:15.910 --> 00:41:21.010
Work in good faith with the
regulators and the like.

00:41:21.010 --> 00:41:23.110
And because they're
smaller, often

00:41:23.110 --> 00:41:25.840
regulators around the
globe have decided

00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:27.250
to give a little forbearance.

00:41:27.250 --> 00:41:29.860
There's something called
regulatory sandboxes

00:41:29.860 --> 00:41:31.810
to promote innovation.

00:41:31.810 --> 00:41:34.550
If they were larger, there
would be more systemic

00:41:34.550 --> 00:41:38.140
and customer-facing problems.

00:41:38.140 --> 00:41:40.720
And then fourthly, there's
the official sector.

00:41:40.720 --> 00:41:45.190
And so while finance, tech, and
startups are competing and sort

00:41:45.190 --> 00:41:47.860
of trying to provide
better products and better

00:41:47.860 --> 00:41:50.140
opportunities and
user interfaces,

00:41:50.140 --> 00:41:52.900
the official sector cares
about economic growth,

00:41:52.900 --> 00:41:55.540
but they also care about
financial stability.

00:41:55.540 --> 00:41:59.830
And sometimes they're a
little bit in conflict.

00:41:59.830 --> 00:42:03.850
Also, guarding against illicit
activity, promoting inclusion,

00:42:03.850 --> 00:42:06.850
and the tenets of investor
and consumer protection.

00:42:09.730 --> 00:42:13.660
So what were the big
technologies we talked about?

00:42:13.660 --> 00:42:15.780
And Romain, I'm
going to pause to see

00:42:15.780 --> 00:42:17.070
if there are any questions.

00:42:19.890 --> 00:42:20.890
Still there?

00:42:20.890 --> 00:42:21.690
ROMAIN: Yes.

00:42:21.690 --> 00:42:23.610
I don't see any so far.

00:42:23.610 --> 00:42:25.800
GARY GENSLER: I just wanted
to make sure my internet

00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:27.790
connection didn't go.

00:42:27.790 --> 00:42:31.800
So right now in
finance, where we've

00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:34.890
seen machine learning,
this extraordinary ability

00:42:34.890 --> 00:42:40.880
to extract patterns, extract
correlations out of data.

00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:44.180
We've seen it
primarily in the middle

00:42:44.180 --> 00:42:49.430
here around fraud detection
and prevention, regulatory,

00:42:49.430 --> 00:42:52.190
that a lot of the credit
card companies and big banks

00:42:52.190 --> 00:42:56.720
are using it to extract
correlations to better do

00:42:56.720 --> 00:42:59.810
fraud protection and better
do what's called any money

00:42:59.810 --> 00:43:02.160
laundering and compliance.

00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:04.970
So that big bucket
is compliance.

00:43:04.970 --> 00:43:07.820
I'd say the second
most developed area

00:43:07.820 --> 00:43:10.910
is around natural language
processing or call centers,

00:43:10.910 --> 00:43:12.980
chat bots, robo advising.

00:43:12.980 --> 00:43:17.330
We all have studied together
robo advising and investments

00:43:17.330 --> 00:43:24.470
like around firms like
Betterment and Wealthfront,

00:43:24.470 --> 00:43:27.500
I think it's called, and others.

00:43:27.500 --> 00:43:30.350
But robo advising, both
in the credit space,

00:43:30.350 --> 00:43:34.430
investing space as well.

00:43:34.430 --> 00:43:40.440
And Bank of America has their
voice assistant called Erica.

00:43:40.440 --> 00:43:44.600
The Siris and Alexas
of finance are going

00:43:44.600 --> 00:43:49.640
to be built out in the 2020s.

00:43:49.640 --> 00:43:52.040
But I think the most
interesting area,

00:43:52.040 --> 00:43:54.950
which is not, frankly,
used that much yet--

00:43:54.950 --> 00:43:57.380
it's being used, but not a lot--

00:43:57.380 --> 00:43:59.840
is around the underwriting
decisions, underwriting

00:43:59.840 --> 00:44:02.560
and insurance,
underwriting in credit.

00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:05.570
Basically, how do you
allocate and extend

00:44:05.570 --> 00:44:08.450
and price credit or risk?

00:44:08.450 --> 00:44:11.960
This is at the core of finance
because the core of finance,

00:44:11.960 --> 00:44:13.760
that sort of neck
of the hourglass,

00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:17.020
is standing between
savers and borrowers,

00:44:17.020 --> 00:44:20.360
or standing between those
who have a risk and those

00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:22.580
who are willing to bear a risk.

00:44:22.580 --> 00:44:24.770
And as you're at that
neck of the hourglass,

00:44:24.770 --> 00:44:27.920
if you can use machine
learning to better allocate

00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:35.040
price and extend
credit or insurance,

00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:36.870
then you're going to
use that technology.

00:44:36.870 --> 00:44:41.440
And extracting patterns is
an important part to do that.

00:44:41.440 --> 00:44:43.320
Now you need to do
it within the law you

00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:47.010
need to do it within these
questions of fairness

00:44:47.010 --> 00:44:48.990
and explainability.

00:44:48.990 --> 00:44:51.900
But I think we're going to
see this grow dramatically

00:44:51.900 --> 00:44:53.020
by the mid 2020s.

00:44:53.020 --> 00:44:54.060
It's already there.

00:44:54.060 --> 00:44:55.310
I'm not saying it's not there.

00:44:55.310 --> 00:44:58.350
I'm just saying we will
see machine learning used

00:44:58.350 --> 00:45:02.670
much more, especially
around alternative data.

00:45:02.670 --> 00:45:05.280
We've seen it a bit in asset
management and trading,

00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:10.080
but frankly, it's not dominating
the trading floors yet.

00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:13.980
It's not dominating
the hedge funds yet.

00:45:13.980 --> 00:45:15.570
And a lot of folks
in the hedge fund

00:45:15.570 --> 00:45:17.880
community and high
frequency trading community

00:45:17.880 --> 00:45:22.500
say that their algorithms,
their linear sort

00:45:22.500 --> 00:45:26.640
of type of regressions
and classic statistics,

00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:28.860
are doing well enough.

00:45:28.860 --> 00:45:31.740
But I think we'll see
this dramatically shift.

00:45:31.740 --> 00:45:34.170
And I think at times,
the real question

00:45:34.170 --> 00:45:36.750
is, will machine
learning be better

00:45:36.750 --> 00:45:40.500
than a classic set of regression
analyses, a classic set

00:45:40.500 --> 00:45:42.790
of statistics that you can do?

00:45:42.790 --> 00:45:44.330
The answer is if
it's not, you'll

00:45:44.330 --> 00:45:46.710
stick with the
classic statistics.

00:45:46.710 --> 00:45:52.500
It's not as if you have to throw
away the classic data analysis.

00:45:52.500 --> 00:45:55.920
This is just a stronger tool
in certain circumstances

00:45:55.920 --> 00:45:59.100
to add on top of it.

00:45:59.100 --> 00:46:02.030
Romain, questions?

00:46:02.030 --> 00:46:05.000
ROMAIN: Let's give
it a few seconds.

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:06.350
One, two, three.

00:46:06.350 --> 00:46:08.483
No questions, Gary.

00:46:08.483 --> 00:46:09.900
GARY GENSLER: There
is this debate

00:46:09.900 --> 00:46:12.750
sometimes, is artificial
intelligence machine learning

00:46:12.750 --> 00:46:14.220
a tool or a Service?

00:46:14.220 --> 00:46:17.310
Is it itself an industry or not?

00:46:17.310 --> 00:46:19.790
I find myself thinking
more and more,

00:46:19.790 --> 00:46:24.010
it's frankly a tool dominantly.

00:46:24.010 --> 00:46:26.860
But it is also a
service at times.

00:46:26.860 --> 00:46:29.710
It is a tool that is
already being used

00:46:29.710 --> 00:46:32.740
and will be used more and
more inside of big finance,

00:46:32.740 --> 00:46:35.950
big tech, and disruptors.

00:46:35.950 --> 00:46:39.070
But that's not to say it's
not also a service at times.

00:46:39.070 --> 00:46:43.240
It can be something
like I'm showing here

00:46:43.240 --> 00:46:44.860
as a compliance software.

00:46:44.860 --> 00:46:47.200
So you can stand up
a company that does

00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:49.540
one of these things going back.

00:46:49.540 --> 00:46:54.840
You can stand up a company that
does fraud detection better

00:46:54.840 --> 00:46:58.890
than the banks do right
now or stands up something

00:46:58.890 --> 00:47:03.240
around credit or insurance,
as a number of startups

00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:05.700
have done in the
insurance field that

00:47:05.700 --> 00:47:10.060
can take data in, access data.

00:47:10.060 --> 00:47:12.640
And maybe you're a data
aggregator from the payment

00:47:12.640 --> 00:47:16.310
space like Plaid , or a
data aggregator in insurance

00:47:16.310 --> 00:47:18.550
that's taking in all
that telematics data from

00:47:18.550 --> 00:47:20.350
automobiles.

00:47:20.350 --> 00:47:25.240
And taking that data, you
can use AI as a service.

00:47:25.240 --> 00:47:27.940
And some of these, like
anti-fraud softwares

00:47:27.940 --> 00:47:30.580
like Featurespace and
others, or Tractable,

00:47:30.580 --> 00:47:33.700
which is doing insurance
claims processing,

00:47:33.700 --> 00:47:36.190
are doing AI as a service.

00:47:36.190 --> 00:47:39.850
I think you'll see, though, that
the dominant way we're going

00:47:39.850 --> 00:47:43.750
to be thinking about
AI, really already now,

00:47:43.750 --> 00:47:45.460
but within a few
years, it's a tool

00:47:45.460 --> 00:47:47.950
that if you don't have
it in your toolkit,

00:47:47.950 --> 00:47:51.550
if you don't use machine
learning to do better data

00:47:51.550 --> 00:47:55.480
analytics, you're going
to fall behind somewhere,

00:47:55.480 --> 00:47:57.430
whether it's in
your compliance side

00:47:57.430 --> 00:47:59.830
or whether it's in
your underwriting side.

00:47:59.830 --> 00:48:02.290
And others who use
machine learning

00:48:02.290 --> 00:48:08.290
will have a more nuanced, more
flexible, and ultimately higher

00:48:08.290 --> 00:48:12.190
revenue potential, lower
cost potential underwriting

00:48:12.190 --> 00:48:15.420
of insurance or credit.

00:48:15.420 --> 00:48:19.020
But I'd think about
it as both ways.

00:48:19.020 --> 00:48:21.390
Natural language
processing, a form

00:48:21.390 --> 00:48:24.930
of artificial intelligence,
but important slipstream.

00:48:24.930 --> 00:48:30.540
It's really about taking human
words and computer language

00:48:30.540 --> 00:48:31.950
and doing the interface.

00:48:31.950 --> 00:48:36.290
Content generation, content
summarization, and the like.

00:48:36.290 --> 00:48:38.850
And so what are we already
using it for in finance?

00:48:38.850 --> 00:48:40.170
A lot of ways.

00:48:40.170 --> 00:48:43.590
Customer service, those
chat bots and the Ericas

00:48:43.590 --> 00:48:48.000
at Bank of America and the
robo advisors and the like.

00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:48.990
That's a big piece.

00:48:48.990 --> 00:48:53.340
But that's going to continue to
be facilitated and go further,

00:48:53.340 --> 00:48:56.700
where one day we'll get on the
phone and we won't quite know,

00:48:56.700 --> 00:49:00.360
are we talking to a human or
a chat bot on the other line?

00:49:00.360 --> 00:49:04.720
Chat bots right now can't
deal with sarcasm too well.

00:49:04.720 --> 00:49:08.520
So you can kind of suss it
out, still, a little bit

00:49:08.520 --> 00:49:11.190
with a little bit of sarcasm.

00:49:11.190 --> 00:49:15.360
But I don't know, in a number
of years, what it will be.

00:49:15.360 --> 00:49:18.480
Basic process
automation, and an area

00:49:18.480 --> 00:49:21.750
that asset managers are
using more and more, still

00:49:21.750 --> 00:49:23.760
just a little bit,
using more and more,

00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:29.340
sentiment analysis, analyzing
vast amount of spoken words,

00:49:29.340 --> 00:49:31.260
written words,
and seeing if they

00:49:31.260 --> 00:49:34.703
can assess a sentiment
that might be important

00:49:34.703 --> 00:49:35.745
investing in the markets.

00:49:39.310 --> 00:49:42.520
We spent a fair amount of time
on open API and open banking.

00:49:42.520 --> 00:49:44.830
And the critical
thing here is really

00:49:44.830 --> 00:49:49.330
access to data and an
ability to build software

00:49:49.330 --> 00:49:52.490
on top of platforms.

00:49:52.490 --> 00:49:55.900
So in this case, think of
big finance as the platforms,

00:49:55.900 --> 00:49:59.560
just like you might think
of Facebook as a platform.

00:49:59.560 --> 00:50:03.460
Can you build some
software on top of it?

00:50:03.460 --> 00:50:07.960
Maybe it's software to do
one small aspect of finance

00:50:07.960 --> 00:50:12.790
better than the big platform is
doing right now, just like you

00:50:12.790 --> 00:50:17.620
can build one small application
on top of Facebook and say,

00:50:17.620 --> 00:50:18.940
we can do something better.

00:50:18.940 --> 00:50:22.150
Now Facebook and other
technology platforms

00:50:22.150 --> 00:50:25.420
sought to facilitate
this through open API,

00:50:25.420 --> 00:50:28.720
saying developers can build
on top of our platforms.

00:50:28.720 --> 00:50:31.590
Big finance was of mixed minds.

00:50:31.590 --> 00:50:33.550
Some of big finance
wanted to promote it.

00:50:33.550 --> 00:50:34.720
Some didn't.

00:50:34.720 --> 00:50:38.050
The official sector stepped
in, particularly in Europe,

00:50:38.050 --> 00:50:41.650
with the payment systems
directive and other directives

00:50:41.650 --> 00:50:44.950
in the United Kingdom
around open API.

00:50:44.950 --> 00:50:47.650
But then around the globe,
Brazil and other countries,

00:50:47.650 --> 00:50:50.260
as we talked about,
said no, we've

00:50:50.260 --> 00:50:52.800
got to promote some
competition here

00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:56.080
and share data, in essence.

00:50:56.080 --> 00:50:58.300
The shared data is
permission by us.

00:50:58.300 --> 00:51:02.830
That means we say, yes,
you can have my data.

00:51:02.830 --> 00:51:07.050
It's sitting there at Bank of
America, but you can have it.

00:51:07.050 --> 00:51:09.390
The alternatives--
and this is kind

00:51:09.390 --> 00:51:11.850
of an interesting
technological competition--

00:51:11.850 --> 00:51:16.180
the alternatives was,
I could permission

00:51:16.180 --> 00:51:18.610
an application like
Credit Karma to go

00:51:18.610 --> 00:51:21.320
get my data at Bank of America.

00:51:21.320 --> 00:51:24.400
And if Bank of America did
not provide an open API

00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:27.610
to Credit Karma, or
an open API, possibly,

00:51:27.610 --> 00:51:31.120
to Plaid, which is
a data aggregator,

00:51:31.120 --> 00:51:36.590
that Plaid then created
data to Credit Karma.

00:51:36.590 --> 00:51:40.340
If Bank of America said
now, then maybe Credit Karma

00:51:40.340 --> 00:51:43.100
would go and do something
called screen scraping,

00:51:43.100 --> 00:51:46.340
literally taking pictures
of screens using technology

00:51:46.340 --> 00:51:49.670
to get that data, or
reverse engineering

00:51:49.670 --> 00:51:52.600
of a robotic process automation.

00:51:52.600 --> 00:51:54.350
So there was a little
bit of a competition

00:51:54.350 --> 00:51:59.080
that open API is also a safer,
more secure way to do it,

00:51:59.080 --> 00:52:01.890
a more standardized
way to do it.

00:52:01.890 --> 00:52:05.810
So what we've seen
is banks kind of--

00:52:05.810 --> 00:52:09.050
a little bit disappointing
to their business model--

00:52:09.050 --> 00:52:11.630
banks kind of coming into this.

00:52:11.630 --> 00:52:14.030
As I said, many banks
thought it was a good idea

00:52:14.030 --> 00:52:17.450
to be more like Facebook
and let startups build apps

00:52:17.450 --> 00:52:18.830
on top of them.

00:52:18.830 --> 00:52:20.570
Some banks said no.

00:52:20.570 --> 00:52:22.730
The official sector
got involved.

00:52:22.730 --> 00:52:26.330
But also, technological
competition got involved,

00:52:26.330 --> 00:52:32.000
this screen scraping and
reverse process automation.

00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:33.125
Romain, I'm going to pause.

00:52:36.940 --> 00:52:41.170
ROMAIN: Let's see if the
class has any questions.

00:52:41.170 --> 00:52:44.070
GARY GENSLER: And I assure
you that more opportunities

00:52:44.070 --> 00:52:46.430
hacve been created
around open API

00:52:46.430 --> 00:52:50.540
and open banking than we could
ever talk about in a semester.

00:52:50.540 --> 00:52:54.830
And it's usually sort of
thought of as a little bit

00:52:54.830 --> 00:52:57.470
infrastructure, a
little bit back office.

00:52:57.470 --> 00:53:00.890
But there's rarely a central
bank governor around the globe

00:53:00.890 --> 00:53:03.080
that isn't talking about
this, thinking about this,

00:53:03.080 --> 00:53:06.980
how to promote competition
within their banking sectors

00:53:06.980 --> 00:53:09.998
and in their countries.

00:53:09.998 --> 00:53:11.540
AUDIENCE: We don't
have any hands up,

00:53:11.540 --> 00:53:14.302
so we can continue, Gary.

00:53:14.302 --> 00:53:16.510
GARY GENSLER: I mentioned
robotic process automation.

00:53:16.510 --> 00:53:18.550
Some of robotic
process automation

00:53:18.550 --> 00:53:22.480
is just the startups using
it to compete and get

00:53:22.480 --> 00:53:26.410
the data in a closed
or more resilient

00:53:26.410 --> 00:53:28.540
system that doesn't
want to give them data.

00:53:28.540 --> 00:53:31.570
In some countries, you
can't get it easily

00:53:31.570 --> 00:53:38.185
through the market structures
or the official sanctioned open

00:53:38.185 --> 00:53:40.120
API.

00:53:40.120 --> 00:53:44.320
But it's also being used by
incumbents just to accounts

00:53:44.320 --> 00:53:45.070
and onboarding.

00:53:45.070 --> 00:53:47.350
It's basically taking
something that humans

00:53:47.350 --> 00:53:49.900
were doing and automating it.

00:53:49.900 --> 00:53:52.480
And it's called robotic
process automation.

00:53:52.480 --> 00:53:54.070
But just think of any process.

00:53:54.070 --> 00:54:00.000
It can be reading documents
and onboarding a client.

00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:02.580
So how does a big wealth
management company,

00:54:02.580 --> 00:54:06.850
how does an online broker or a
mobile broker or online us now,

00:54:06.850 --> 00:54:11.340
and that you can literally
just scan the documents.

00:54:11.340 --> 00:54:14.900
It reads it, and
voila, we're in,

00:54:14.900 --> 00:54:17.970
that we don't have to go to
some bricks and mortar place

00:54:17.970 --> 00:54:22.180
and get physical
documents any longer.

00:54:22.180 --> 00:54:24.270
So it's an important
piece of competition

00:54:24.270 --> 00:54:30.600
in lowering costs, also, and
enhancing user interfaces.

00:54:30.600 --> 00:54:34.080
Let me talk a little bit about
credit scores and alternative

00:54:34.080 --> 00:54:35.280
data.

00:54:35.280 --> 00:54:39.690
The Fair Isaac Company, founded
about 50 to 60 years ago

00:54:39.690 --> 00:54:45.680
by a couple of Stanford
graduates named Fair and Isaac,

00:54:45.680 --> 00:54:48.320
so thus FICO.

00:54:48.320 --> 00:54:50.378
It's used in 32 countries.

00:54:50.378 --> 00:54:52.170
There are many countries
that don't use it,

00:54:52.170 --> 00:54:54.200
but it is a dominant
way to think

00:54:54.200 --> 00:54:57.290
about credit scoring
in the latter part

00:54:57.290 --> 00:55:00.410
of the 20th century and
even the early 21st century.

00:55:00.410 --> 00:55:05.330
And here's the ratios, that
30% of this and 35% of that.

00:55:05.330 --> 00:55:06.680
It's very static.

00:55:06.680 --> 00:55:08.360
It's been updated
about eight times.

00:55:08.360 --> 00:55:13.700
There's a rollout of a new
FICO score this summer of 2020

00:55:13.700 --> 00:55:14.990
as well.

00:55:14.990 --> 00:55:19.370
But alternative data might give
us a better picture on somebody

00:55:19.370 --> 00:55:22.580
and whether they're going
to default on a loan,

00:55:22.580 --> 00:55:25.680
or whether they're the
right insurance risk.

00:55:25.680 --> 00:55:27.890
And so the first sort
of rudimentary level

00:55:27.890 --> 00:55:31.100
of alternative data
that goes beyond FICO

00:55:31.100 --> 00:55:33.800
score is your
employment or income,

00:55:33.800 --> 00:55:37.610
or whether you even
paid your rent on time.

00:55:37.610 --> 00:55:40.310
FICO score traditionally
hasn't used

00:55:40.310 --> 00:55:43.040
even whether you're paying
your utilities or rent

00:55:43.040 --> 00:55:45.130
checks on time.

00:55:45.130 --> 00:55:49.000
Or, as Ally Pay and
WeChat Pay can do,

00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:50.980
look at a small
business and look

00:55:50.980 --> 00:55:55.660
at your whole cash flow picture,
your revenues and your costs.

00:55:55.660 --> 00:55:58.750
Or here in the US,
Intuit, which Intuit

00:55:58.750 --> 00:56:02.590
is a company that has TurboTax
and has more recently bought

00:56:02.590 --> 00:56:06.280
some fintech startups
as well, that Intuit

00:56:06.280 --> 00:56:10.140
can see the whole cash
flow picture around you.

00:56:10.140 --> 00:56:13.210
And so why is Intuit starting
to think about credit?

00:56:13.210 --> 00:56:17.080
Because they can get a really
good picture around you.

00:56:17.080 --> 00:56:18.850
But there's also
everything we do

00:56:18.850 --> 00:56:22.730
online, our consumption and
purchase transactional data.

00:56:22.730 --> 00:56:26.200
Think Visa and Mastercard
and what they know about us,

00:56:26.200 --> 00:56:30.970
or what our bank knows about our
consumption and purchase data,

00:56:30.970 --> 00:56:35.950
using that to say if we buy
one product versus another,

00:56:35.950 --> 00:56:40.600
are we a better credit risk
or a lesser credit risk?

00:56:40.600 --> 00:56:42.760
In an earlier era,
one of the things

00:56:42.760 --> 00:56:46.930
that people would look at, and
this is just a narrow slice,

00:56:46.930 --> 00:56:49.990
is whether you replaced
your automobile tires

00:56:49.990 --> 00:56:52.390
on a regular basis
with new tires,

00:56:52.390 --> 00:56:55.810
or whether you bought retreads,
literally putting rubber

00:56:55.810 --> 00:56:57.760
on the old tires.

00:56:57.760 --> 00:57:01.960
And it was found that new tire
purchasers on a regular basis

00:57:01.960 --> 00:57:04.930
were better credits than
if you bought retreads.

00:57:04.930 --> 00:57:06.400
Well, expand that out.

00:57:06.400 --> 00:57:08.290
What purchase history
would tell you

00:57:08.290 --> 00:57:13.480
that somebody is a little less
or a little bit more capable

00:57:13.480 --> 00:57:16.960
to hold a loan going forward?

00:57:16.960 --> 00:57:20.230
But app usage, browsing
history, emails, et cetera,

00:57:20.230 --> 00:57:22.030
your geolocation.

00:57:22.030 --> 00:57:25.480
And in China, we see this being
used in a social credit scoring

00:57:25.480 --> 00:57:29.530
system where the
government, in coordination

00:57:29.530 --> 00:57:35.330
with many online services,
including Ally Pay and WeChat

00:57:35.330 --> 00:57:40.410
Pay, but even extended to
social networking sites

00:57:40.410 --> 00:57:41.970
like dating apps.

00:57:41.970 --> 00:57:45.450
Literally the dating apps are
feeding in some information

00:57:45.450 --> 00:57:49.020
into the social credit
scoring system in China

00:57:49.020 --> 00:57:53.710
that then can be used about
extension of credit or not.

00:57:53.710 --> 00:57:57.070
And then thirdly, particularly
out of the insurance field

00:57:57.070 --> 00:57:59.920
and insurtech.

00:57:59.920 --> 00:58:01.720
But my question
is, how will this

00:58:01.720 --> 00:58:05.230
be used all the way into
credit extension as well?

00:58:05.230 --> 00:58:07.330
Is the information
being collected

00:58:07.330 --> 00:58:11.290
through drones and Internet
of Things and sensors

00:58:11.290 --> 00:58:13.150
throughout society?

00:58:13.150 --> 00:58:15.100
And we're moving
into a world now

00:58:15.100 --> 00:58:17.950
where we'll go from
tens of billions

00:58:17.950 --> 00:58:19.900
of sensors around
the globe, and that's

00:58:19.900 --> 00:58:23.260
the rough measurement now,
to hundreds of billions

00:58:23.260 --> 00:58:25.980
of sensors around the globe.

00:58:25.980 --> 00:58:29.180
And whether it's in our
refrigerators at home,

00:58:29.180 --> 00:58:32.980
whether it's in our automobiles,
whether it's wearables,

00:58:32.980 --> 00:58:34.990
whether, frankly, one
day it's in the paint

00:58:34.990 --> 00:58:38.840
we paint our houses, literally.

00:58:38.840 --> 00:58:41.720
That type of sensor
technology, then

00:58:41.720 --> 00:58:45.320
how does it feed back
into, first, in insurance,

00:58:45.320 --> 00:58:49.790
our homeowners insurance,
our automobile insurance,

00:58:49.790 --> 00:58:52.490
our health insurance
from a wearable,

00:58:52.490 --> 00:58:56.840
but how that data analytics
then moves into our credit

00:58:56.840 --> 00:58:58.920
scoring as well.

00:58:58.920 --> 00:59:02.510
Now all of this has to be done
somehow within social norms

00:59:02.510 --> 00:59:05.930
and laws about fairness
and explainability

00:59:05.930 --> 00:59:08.600
and guarding against biases.

00:59:08.600 --> 00:59:11.570
And those are real
and important issues,

00:59:11.570 --> 00:59:13.400
but I think that's
where we're headed

00:59:13.400 --> 00:59:15.950
with a lot of this
alternative data.

00:59:15.950 --> 00:59:18.190
Questions?

00:59:18.190 --> 00:59:20.870
This is sthe stuff Dani gets a
little nervous about, I think.

00:59:24.870 --> 00:59:26.980
ROMAIN: Danielle?

00:59:26.980 --> 00:59:29.500
GARY GENSLER: I knew I
would spark something.

00:59:29.500 --> 00:59:32.500
AUDIENCE: Well, since you asked.

00:59:32.500 --> 00:59:34.960
So there is a
international framework

00:59:34.960 --> 00:59:38.710
of laws around the right to
privacy from the human rights

00:59:38.710 --> 00:59:42.010
space that are
applicable to some

00:59:42.010 --> 00:59:45.040
of the emerging ways in which
we're seeing data be collected.

00:59:45.040 --> 00:59:47.875
And I'm just curious
your thoughts on

00:59:47.875 --> 00:59:50.500
whether you see that ever really
getting traction, particularly

00:59:50.500 --> 00:59:55.930
in the US, in terms of impacting
regulations around how data

00:59:55.930 --> 00:59:59.290
is collected, how it's used.

00:59:59.290 --> 01:00:01.413
I realize it's quite
an open-ended question.

01:00:01.413 --> 01:00:02.830
GARY GENSLER: I
think that this is

01:00:02.830 --> 01:00:05.260
going to be an
ongoing public policy

01:00:05.260 --> 01:00:07.060
debate and cultural debate.

01:00:07.060 --> 01:00:09.175
And it's not something
that will settle down

01:00:09.175 --> 01:00:10.300
in just two or three years.

01:00:10.300 --> 01:00:15.310
I think this is a multi-decade
how we feel about this,

01:00:15.310 --> 01:00:23.950
that as sensors,
particularly, will go from 20,

01:00:23.950 --> 01:00:27.310
30 billion or so sensors
already00 maybe it's maybe

01:00:27.310 --> 01:00:30.010
it's even further than that
now to hundreds of billions

01:00:30.010 --> 01:00:31.120
of sensors--

01:00:31.120 --> 01:00:36.360
as they become truly
ubiquitous, and cameras

01:00:36.360 --> 01:00:39.070
in the homes and
the like, that data

01:00:39.070 --> 01:00:42.760
is going to be collected,
analyzed, stored, assessed,

01:00:42.760 --> 01:00:46.480
and used in some way to
underwrite insurance and extend

01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:47.710
credit.

01:00:47.710 --> 01:00:51.310
I think that's the
large cultural trend

01:00:51.310 --> 01:00:54.040
and technological and
financial trend we're on.

01:00:54.040 --> 01:00:55.490
So then how do we
deal with that?

01:00:55.490 --> 01:00:58.880
How do we feel about that,
coupled with all the data

01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:02.230
that's being collected
as we are online

01:01:02.230 --> 01:01:05.890
in our geolocations
with our cell phones?

01:01:05.890 --> 01:01:10.840
So we've seen some jurisdictions
like Europe pass a General Data

01:01:10.840 --> 01:01:13.090
Protection Regulation, GDPR.

01:01:13.090 --> 01:01:16.810
We've seen in the US it's
more state-based, California.

01:01:16.810 --> 01:01:20.750
But even years ago, Illinois
put something in place

01:01:20.750 --> 01:01:25.570
around photographs of our
face that are unique to us

01:01:25.570 --> 01:01:27.890
and so forth.

01:01:27.890 --> 01:01:31.460
So a handful of
states, and so forth.

01:01:31.460 --> 01:01:33.460
I think we're going to
keep trying to figure out

01:01:33.460 --> 01:01:34.690
what's the right balance.

01:01:34.690 --> 01:01:37.240
And even this crisis we're
living through right, now

01:01:37.240 --> 01:01:43.760
the coronavirus crisis,
about contact tracing.

01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:47.560
If we can save lives,
and we can legitimately

01:01:47.560 --> 01:01:50.380
really save lives and
have better health care

01:01:50.380 --> 01:01:55.960
outcomes by tracing
our contacts out,

01:01:55.960 --> 01:01:58.690
not just who we've seen
in the last two days,

01:01:58.690 --> 01:02:01.510
but the last 14 days,
and who they've seen,

01:02:01.510 --> 01:02:04.830
and how some countries
like South Korea,

01:02:04.830 --> 01:02:07.330
and even Vietnam and
elsewhere, have used

01:02:07.330 --> 01:02:10.638
contact tracing to some success.

01:02:10.638 --> 01:02:12.430
There's a lot of research
to be done to see

01:02:12.430 --> 01:02:15.790
how that's truly playing out.

01:02:15.790 --> 01:02:18.910
Will we shift this
debate a little bit?

01:02:18.910 --> 01:02:21.490
Will we all say,
look, I'll give up

01:02:21.490 --> 01:02:23.350
a little bit of my
civil liberties,

01:02:23.350 --> 01:02:27.640
a little bit of my privacy,
for the good of the community

01:02:27.640 --> 01:02:29.390
and the good of health
care and so forth.

01:02:29.390 --> 01:02:32.770
So I think this is going to play
out for quite some time, Dani.

01:02:32.770 --> 01:02:36.660
And I also think technology
can provide solutions,

01:02:36.660 --> 01:02:38.950
and some of it can be around
blockchain technology,

01:02:38.950 --> 01:02:43.300
where Luke and we were talking
earlier about encryption

01:02:43.300 --> 01:02:46.900
you can have data on an
immutable record, really,

01:02:46.900 --> 01:02:49.510
a tamper resistant record on
the blockchain technology that

01:02:49.510 --> 01:02:51.520
is fully public.

01:02:51.520 --> 01:02:55.000
But you can also use
various encryption methods

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:59.500
called zero knowledge proofs
and others to sort of lock it

01:02:59.500 --> 01:03:01.560
down and make it harder to see.

01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:03.220
And there's great
work on this being

01:03:03.220 --> 01:03:07.510
done at MIT by faculty
members like Sandy Pentland

01:03:07.510 --> 01:03:10.630
and Silvio Micali and the like.

01:03:10.630 --> 01:03:14.690
So I think technology can
help this debate as well.

01:03:14.690 --> 01:03:17.560
It might be that we share
things in certain circumstances

01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:22.572
and we sort of protected
in other circumstances.

01:03:22.572 --> 01:03:24.280
So I'm sorry you're
going to end up being

01:03:24.280 --> 01:03:26.470
a little nervous for a while.

01:03:26.470 --> 01:03:28.310
I think technology can help us.

01:03:28.310 --> 01:03:31.390
But I do think we're going to
be sharing a lot more data.

01:03:34.870 --> 01:03:37.570
We talked about
blockchain technology.

01:03:37.570 --> 01:03:40.990
The big question,
to me, is adoption

01:03:40.990 --> 01:03:44.050
rests on addressing
what's its viability?

01:03:44.050 --> 01:03:49.220
What's its comparative
viability and value proposition?

01:03:49.220 --> 01:03:52.120
Do we really need
a private currency,

01:03:52.120 --> 01:03:56.060
or is the fiat currency
working just fine.

01:03:56.060 --> 01:03:58.570
There's been private
currencies for centuries,

01:03:58.570 --> 01:04:01.090
and bitcoin has
shown that it can

01:04:01.090 --> 01:04:07.540
live for now about a dozen years
as a speculative digital store

01:04:07.540 --> 01:04:09.170
of value.

01:04:09.170 --> 01:04:14.690
But can other cryptocurrencies
take hold in small ecosystems,

01:04:14.690 --> 01:04:19.040
whether it's on gaming
sites, in an industry that's

01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:22.550
nearly $175 billion,
$200 billion industry

01:04:22.550 --> 01:04:24.740
around the globe,
can it take hold

01:04:24.740 --> 01:04:27.530
in online gambling
in a legal way,

01:04:27.530 --> 01:04:31.640
not in some of the sketchier,
fraud-oriented ways.

01:04:31.640 --> 01:04:34.340
Can private
currencies in gambling

01:04:34.340 --> 01:04:39.860
be like casino chips, but again,
in a, hopefully, legal way.

01:04:39.860 --> 01:04:42.530
Could it have some
broader applications?

01:04:42.530 --> 01:04:47.030
And blockchain technology has
a shared database structure,

01:04:47.030 --> 01:04:48.170
a shared ledger.

01:04:48.170 --> 01:04:50.870
Can it promote standardization?

01:04:50.870 --> 01:04:53.300
Can it promote some
co-opetition where

01:04:53.300 --> 01:04:56.690
some infrastructure is
shared, and then companies

01:04:56.690 --> 01:05:00.260
compete on top of it, like in
trade finance and elsewhere.

01:05:00.260 --> 01:05:01.730
I think school's still out.

01:05:01.730 --> 01:05:05.735
We don't know yet,
beyond sort of this thing

01:05:05.735 --> 01:05:07.110
that we've already
seen that it's

01:05:07.110 --> 01:05:09.090
been a heck of a
catalyst for change.

01:05:09.090 --> 01:05:12.870
It is pushing up against big
finance and central banks

01:05:12.870 --> 01:05:15.030
to think about
payment systems, I

01:05:15.030 --> 01:05:21.690
think, in a more inclusive, more
24 hour a day, seven day a week

01:05:21.690 --> 01:05:22.620
way.

01:05:22.620 --> 01:05:24.540
I think it's making
payment system

01:05:24.540 --> 01:05:30.240
providers, central banks, and
big tech think about new ways

01:05:30.240 --> 01:05:32.680
to do cross-border remittances.

01:05:32.680 --> 01:05:34.950
And I think Facebook
has both sort

01:05:34.950 --> 01:05:40.270
of put some nervousness
in central bankers,

01:05:40.270 --> 01:05:45.670
but hopefully also promote them
to do their payment solutions

01:05:45.670 --> 01:05:47.510
in a better way for the public.

01:05:47.510 --> 01:05:50.050
So it's been a
catalyst for change.

01:05:50.050 --> 01:05:53.670
But I think school's still
out about how much mainstream

01:05:53.670 --> 01:05:55.658
adoption we'll see.

01:05:55.658 --> 01:05:57.700
And the payment system,
we're going to quickly do

01:05:57.700 --> 01:05:59.050
some of the sectors.

01:05:59.050 --> 01:06:01.768
These were some of the pain
points we talked about.

01:06:01.768 --> 01:06:03.310
Who were the players
that we've seen?

01:06:03.310 --> 01:06:06.220
Well, big financer players in
every one of these sectors.

01:06:06.220 --> 01:06:12.200
I won't repeat this slide, but
never count big finance out.

01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:15.500
Most of these companies are
spending multiple billions

01:06:15.500 --> 01:06:18.440
of dollars of a year on
their technology budgets.

01:06:18.440 --> 01:06:20.390
Most of these
companies that you see

01:06:20.390 --> 01:06:23.030
on the screen, the
Bank of Americs,

01:06:23.030 --> 01:06:30.140
is the Cap Ones, the Vanguards,
have not hundreds, but maybe

01:06:30.140 --> 01:06:33.890
thousands of people in their
data analytics machine learning

01:06:33.890 --> 01:06:34.820
side.

01:06:34.820 --> 01:06:38.420
And nearly all of them are
using robo advisors or chat bots

01:06:38.420 --> 01:06:39.740
by now.

01:06:39.740 --> 01:06:44.900
So big finance is incorporating
as much of this technology in,

01:06:44.900 --> 01:06:47.030
but they have legacy
business models.

01:06:47.030 --> 01:06:50.090
They have legacy tech stacks.

01:06:50.090 --> 01:06:53.010
They have legacy approaches.

01:06:53.010 --> 01:06:58.290
And so that provides
opportunities for big tech

01:06:58.290 --> 01:06:59.390
and startups.

01:06:59.390 --> 01:07:01.400
So in the payment space,
we talked about it.

01:07:01.400 --> 01:07:08.450
Ally Pay and M-Pesa in Kenya
and Africa, really got in there.

01:07:08.450 --> 01:07:11.420
And then Amazon and
Google and so forth.

01:07:11.420 --> 01:07:15.330
And in South Korea, Kakao
Pay have really rolled in.

01:07:15.330 --> 01:07:18.290
And in certain countries,
like in Africa,

01:07:18.290 --> 01:07:24.770
in Asia, big tech fundamentally
dominates the payment space.

01:07:24.770 --> 01:07:28.010
Startups got in, often,
around data aggregation,

01:07:28.010 --> 01:07:32.890
like Plaid and others, and
open API, but also got in

01:07:32.890 --> 01:07:36.460
around sectors like Toast
in the restaurant business.

01:07:36.460 --> 01:07:40.720
Or some just did the job a
little better than big finance

01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:41.890
and had enough time.

01:07:41.890 --> 01:07:45.430
Some got in, also, around
cross-border remittances

01:07:45.430 --> 01:07:48.430
like Transferwise and the like.

01:07:48.430 --> 01:07:53.630
countries like Brazil and seen
Pax Sikora and PayTM in India.

01:07:53.630 --> 01:07:56.890
So it's not isolated
to developed countries.

01:07:56.890 --> 01:07:58.900
It's not isolated to Asia.

01:07:58.900 --> 01:08:02.140
It's around the globe,
the payment space

01:08:02.140 --> 01:08:05.560
has been very dynamic area.

01:08:05.560 --> 01:08:07.000
Credit markets.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:08.620
Credit markets
we've talked about.

01:08:08.620 --> 01:08:12.430
The market design has
a lot of features,

01:08:12.430 --> 01:08:15.250
and thus a lot of gaps
and a lot of pain points,

01:08:15.250 --> 01:08:18.609
whether it's around data,
funding, marketing channels.

01:08:18.609 --> 01:08:20.950
I think a lot of what we've
seen in the credit area

01:08:20.950 --> 01:08:25.090
has been about enhanced user
experience and user interface,

01:08:25.090 --> 01:08:27.560
but then using alternative data.

01:08:27.560 --> 01:08:31.689
And on the funding side, trying
to find an issuer bank partner

01:08:31.689 --> 01:08:33.910
or securitizing.

01:08:33.910 --> 01:08:36.220
By and large, the
startups haven't said,

01:08:36.220 --> 01:08:37.380
it's our balance sheet.

01:08:40.020 --> 01:08:43.260
That's sort of like a
comparative advantage, for now,

01:08:43.260 --> 01:08:46.290
of the big financial firms.

01:08:46.290 --> 01:08:50.069
And you could be in any part of
the value chains, all the way

01:08:50.069 --> 01:08:53.010
from the brokerage in
origination all the way down

01:08:53.010 --> 01:08:55.640
to collecting and foreclosing.

01:08:55.640 --> 01:08:59.330
You'd have to pick sort of
where you're going to be.

01:08:59.330 --> 01:09:03.100
Competition has been
fierce in big tech.

01:09:03.100 --> 01:09:07.210
Not only does Amazon have Amazon
Pay, they have Amazon Lending.

01:09:07.210 --> 01:09:09.580
Apple has an Apple
credit card now,

01:09:09.580 --> 01:09:13.450
partnering up with Goldman
Sachs and Mastercard.

01:09:13.450 --> 01:09:17.779
Keiko Bank on top of Keiko Pay.

01:09:17.779 --> 01:09:20.300
And often, the
theory of the case

01:09:20.300 --> 01:09:22.069
was build a payment
infrastructure,

01:09:22.069 --> 01:09:25.729
get in the payment side, and
then put credit on top of it.

01:09:25.729 --> 01:09:28.437
But then there's been a bunch
of startups that have said,

01:09:28.437 --> 01:09:30.229
we're not going to
build the payment space.

01:09:30.229 --> 01:09:33.050
That's already pretty
darned competitive.

01:09:33.050 --> 01:09:35.850
We're just going to come
into the credit side.

01:09:35.850 --> 01:09:40.670
And I've just sort of thrown
up the logos of 20 or 25 credit

01:09:40.670 --> 01:09:44.035
startups that tend
to be unicorns.

01:09:44.035 --> 01:09:46.160
I don't know if they're
still worth over $1 billion

01:09:46.160 --> 01:09:48.529
in the middle of
the corona crisis.

01:09:48.529 --> 01:09:50.960
But there's a lot of
different models here.

01:09:50.960 --> 01:09:53.510
Some are just going straight
at the banking model

01:09:53.510 --> 01:09:56.690
like Revolut other neo banks.

01:09:56.690 --> 01:10:00.380
Some have come at it from
the credit card space.

01:10:00.380 --> 01:10:05.690
Some have done it from
low cost credit reports

01:10:05.690 --> 01:10:07.070
like Credit Karma.

01:10:07.070 --> 01:10:09.410
So there's a lot
of different angles

01:10:09.410 --> 01:10:12.620
to how to break into
the credit space,

01:10:12.620 --> 01:10:18.310
all of it fundamentally going
back to some slice of market

01:10:18.310 --> 01:10:21.973
design, that if you're looking
at one of these businesses,

01:10:21.973 --> 01:10:23.890
if you're thinking about
being employed by one

01:10:23.890 --> 01:10:26.368
of these businesses, think
what's their business model?

01:10:26.368 --> 01:10:27.910
Is their business
model fundamentally

01:10:27.910 --> 01:10:30.100
about a better user experience?

01:10:30.100 --> 01:10:32.680
Is it about somehow
doing alternative data

01:10:32.680 --> 01:10:35.200
in a way that's different
or better than others?

01:10:35.200 --> 01:10:37.710
Is it about one
slice of the rolls?

01:10:37.710 --> 01:10:40.390
And they're the
best, and they're

01:10:40.390 --> 01:10:43.690
trying to be the best at
the front end brokerage.

01:10:43.690 --> 01:10:47.380
We've seen in the mortgage
space, for 20 years now,

01:10:47.380 --> 01:10:50.200
this take off, but
particularly post

01:10:50.200 --> 01:10:53.830
the 2008 crisis, the
Quicken Loan and Penny Mac

01:10:53.830 --> 01:10:58.480
and others now dominate
the front end of mortgages.

01:10:58.480 --> 01:11:01.330
Now partly they're able to do
that because our government

01:11:01.330 --> 01:11:04.690
here in the US is so
involved with conforming

01:11:04.690 --> 01:11:07.690
loan market and Fannie
Mae and Freddie Mac,

01:11:07.690 --> 01:11:10.210
and what's called the
government-sponsored

01:11:10.210 --> 01:11:11.350
enterprises.

01:11:11.350 --> 01:11:15.100
And we have a really large,
developed $10 trillion

01:11:15.100 --> 01:11:19.720
market, nearly, on
mortgage securitizations.

01:11:19.720 --> 01:11:22.420
So you can be Quicken Loan
and be at the front end

01:11:22.420 --> 01:11:27.780
and say, just like I might
rent data storage in the cloud,

01:11:27.780 --> 01:11:31.530
I'm kind of, in essence,
renting balance sheet

01:11:31.530 --> 01:11:34.040
by securitizing the mortgages.

01:11:34.040 --> 01:11:35.880
A little tougher in
some other fields,

01:11:35.880 --> 01:11:39.930
but you've seen a real takeoff
in the US of the personal loan

01:11:39.930 --> 01:11:40.975
marketplace.

01:11:40.975 --> 01:11:42.850
I think you can sort of
envision that's going

01:11:42.850 --> 01:11:47.550
to keep competing with the
credit card space as well.

01:11:47.550 --> 01:11:51.560
We talked about capital markets,
and particularly this move

01:11:51.560 --> 01:11:53.390
to zero commissions.

01:11:53.390 --> 01:12:01.240
And late in 2019, we saw sort
of the final part of 20-,

01:12:01.240 --> 01:12:05.960
one might even say 50-year
history of commissions coming

01:12:05.960 --> 01:12:09.980
down and down, starting
with the early 1970s,

01:12:09.980 --> 01:12:13.970
when laws were changed
to allow for competition

01:12:13.970 --> 01:12:15.080
and commissions.

01:12:15.080 --> 01:12:17.300
But it really took
a startup named

01:12:17.300 --> 01:12:21.200
Robin Hood to get to
about 10 million users,

01:12:21.200 --> 01:12:25.130
a free commission app.

01:12:25.130 --> 01:12:28.220
Robin Hood just started
a few years ago,

01:12:28.220 --> 01:12:34.910
sort of competing with earlier
fintech startups, earlier

01:12:34.910 --> 01:12:40.940
fintech startups like Ameritrade
and E-trade and the like.

01:12:40.940 --> 01:12:46.760
And last fall of
2019, zero commission.

01:12:46.760 --> 01:12:49.530
But I like this slide,
which is this iceberg.

01:12:49.530 --> 01:12:51.860
There's a lot of other
ways to earn revenues,

01:12:51.860 --> 01:12:59.280
revenues around selling the
order flow, as Robinhood does,

01:12:59.280 --> 01:13:04.740
or earning fees on managing and
custodial side of the balance

01:13:04.740 --> 01:13:07.880
sheets for investors.

01:13:07.880 --> 01:13:10.270
So I think there's
a competition going

01:13:10.270 --> 01:13:15.520
on to what might look like
zero commissions or zero fees,

01:13:15.520 --> 01:13:19.240
and then there'll be other
revenue models below it.

01:13:19.240 --> 01:13:22.000
We also have seen robo advising.

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:25.300
And Betterment and
Wealthfront and others

01:13:25.300 --> 01:13:28.840
have really gotten significantly
into robo advising.

01:13:28.840 --> 01:13:32.680
2020, already 50 million,
60 million accounts that

01:13:32.680 --> 01:13:36.220
have robo advising in there.

01:13:36.220 --> 01:13:38.180
And so the capital markets.

01:13:38.180 --> 01:13:40.780
This is the fintech startups.

01:13:40.780 --> 01:13:44.350
Remember, Vanguard and
Fidelity are not just

01:13:44.350 --> 01:13:46.210
sleeping, or T. Rowe Price.

01:13:46.210 --> 01:13:49.240
They are moving into
robo advising as well.

01:13:49.240 --> 01:13:53.020
And Robin Hood pushing
to zero fees also

01:13:53.020 --> 01:14:00.260
moved Ameritrade and
Vanguard and Fidelity et al

01:14:00.260 --> 01:14:03.500
into a more competitive space.

01:14:03.500 --> 01:14:06.290
And they're building on top
of another technology called

01:14:06.290 --> 01:14:09.170
exchange traded funds,
which was an earlier

01:14:09.170 --> 01:14:12.380
era of fintech as well,
these low cost asset

01:14:12.380 --> 01:14:14.440
management funds.

01:14:14.440 --> 01:14:17.620
We talked about the
asset management side

01:14:17.620 --> 01:14:21.460
itself, Acorn, Betterment
and Wealthfront and the like.

01:14:21.460 --> 01:14:23.770
These are just some
of the unicorns.

01:14:23.770 --> 01:14:26.930
In the capital
market space as well,

01:14:26.930 --> 01:14:29.320
we have a bunch of
crypto exchanges.

01:14:29.320 --> 01:14:31.390
But it's not just
crypto exchanges.

01:14:31.390 --> 01:14:35.440
A few of these companies
are outside of that.

01:14:35.440 --> 01:14:36.480
And then insurance.

01:14:36.480 --> 01:14:38.840
I know it didn't
light up the class,

01:14:38.840 --> 01:14:42.110
but I kind of think insurance
brings so much of this

01:14:42.110 --> 01:14:43.530
together.

01:14:43.530 --> 01:14:47.000
And I think it's worthwhile
to study insurm tech even

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:50.220
if you're keen interest is
over in credit tech or payment

01:14:50.220 --> 01:14:55.700
tech, if I might say, because
what's happening in insurtech

01:14:55.700 --> 01:14:57.810
is the opportunities are real.

01:14:57.810 --> 01:15:00.950
The user interfaces,
the user experiences

01:15:00.950 --> 01:15:04.620
are a little bit, frankly, more
staid and a little bit more

01:15:04.620 --> 01:15:05.460
clunkier.

01:15:05.460 --> 01:15:09.180
They feel from an earlier time
when you take out an insurance

01:15:09.180 --> 01:15:11.030
policy.

01:15:11.030 --> 01:15:13.550
The underwriting has a
lot of the same issues.

01:15:13.550 --> 01:15:18.440
But also the data, you can
pull from a lot more data,

01:15:18.440 --> 01:15:20.450
as we've talked about.

01:15:20.450 --> 01:15:23.750
And the current sector,
just like payment sector

01:15:23.750 --> 01:15:26.210
has pain points,
the insurance sector

01:15:26.210 --> 01:15:30.000
has a lot of challenges
from the fee structures,

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.870
between 8% and 15%
of the revenues

01:15:32.870 --> 01:15:35.420
go back to the agents
and broker fees,

01:15:35.420 --> 01:15:39.560
to the claims administration,
a lot of significant operating

01:15:39.560 --> 01:15:41.610
and expenses.

01:15:41.610 --> 01:15:44.890
And we hear this debate
around health care policy.

01:15:44.890 --> 01:15:48.370
We hear it about, just
how do we sort of take

01:15:48.370 --> 01:15:51.610
the costs out of the
system in insurance,

01:15:51.610 --> 01:15:55.930
so for every dollar
that you pay in premium,

01:15:55.930 --> 01:16:00.100
a higher percentage of that
dollar goes back in claims.

01:16:00.100 --> 01:16:03.310
Now we'll always have some
cost of claims management

01:16:03.310 --> 01:16:05.800
and agents and
brokers and the like.

01:16:05.800 --> 01:16:08.530
But how do we sort of
compress claims management?

01:16:08.530 --> 01:16:10.750
How do we compress
the selling so

01:16:10.750 --> 01:16:13.870
that a higher
percentage of premiums

01:16:13.870 --> 01:16:17.820
ultimately goes to claims?

01:16:17.820 --> 01:16:19.660
And so we've seen a
lot of competition

01:16:19.660 --> 01:16:23.170
in property and casualty,
health, benefit administration.

01:16:23.170 --> 01:16:24.970
More around property
and casualty

01:16:24.970 --> 01:16:27.880
because this is around
automobile insurance

01:16:27.880 --> 01:16:29.900
and household insurance.

01:16:29.900 --> 01:16:31.870
Most of the insurance
startups are

01:16:31.870 --> 01:16:34.910
focusing on the retail sector.

01:16:34.910 --> 01:16:37.580
But that's also true
in credit products.

01:16:37.580 --> 01:16:41.720
Think about where most of the
payment and credit startups,

01:16:41.720 --> 01:16:45.550
they're focusing on you and
me and small businesses.

01:16:45.550 --> 01:16:49.600
They're not trying to take
away the payment and credit

01:16:49.600 --> 01:16:53.780
allocation to Ford
Motor Company.

01:16:53.780 --> 01:16:57.940
They're trying to help
us, help the broad public,

01:16:57.940 --> 01:17:02.890
with a better user interface
and a better product offering.

01:17:02.890 --> 01:17:06.850
And in this area,
these auto insurers

01:17:06.850 --> 01:17:09.520
like Root Insurance
can actually give us

01:17:09.520 --> 01:17:12.220
insurance based
upon the telematics

01:17:12.220 --> 01:17:15.470
and how we're
driving in that car.

01:17:15.470 --> 01:17:17.740
Now that might square
Dani a little bit,

01:17:17.740 --> 01:17:19.700
that they know exactly
where you're driving

01:17:19.700 --> 01:17:21.290
and how you're driving
and whether you

01:17:21.290 --> 01:17:23.960
put your foot on your
brake too often or not

01:17:23.960 --> 01:17:26.360
in their data analytics model.

01:17:26.360 --> 01:17:28.070
I'm not trying to
judge how often Dani

01:17:28.070 --> 01:17:29.900
puts your foot on the brake.

01:17:29.900 --> 01:17:33.620
But in their data analytics
model, they might think so.

01:17:33.620 --> 01:17:36.860
Or in India, Policy Bazaar
that really is kind of

01:17:36.860 --> 01:17:40.700
like the Expedia of insurance
in India, where you can

01:17:40.700 --> 01:17:44.755
compare and contrast insurance.

01:17:44.755 --> 01:17:46.130
There's a lot of
exciting things.

01:17:46.130 --> 01:17:47.930
Here I am going
again, trying to get

01:17:47.930 --> 01:17:49.700
you excited about insurtech.

01:17:49.700 --> 01:17:51.810
But I would study
insurtech to say, OK,

01:17:51.810 --> 01:17:53.600
what can I learn
from it, to move back

01:17:53.600 --> 01:17:55.100
to the rest of
fintech, what I might

01:17:55.100 --> 01:18:01.490
call credit tech or investech
or payment tech, if you wish,

01:18:01.490 --> 01:18:05.720
because I think a lot
that's going on here

01:18:05.720 --> 01:18:08.630
will influence back.

01:18:08.630 --> 01:18:10.580
Or you might say it's
already happened.

01:18:10.580 --> 01:18:12.380
Some of what's happening,
insurance tech,

01:18:12.380 --> 01:18:18.080
is a little later, but has
already happened elsewhere.

01:18:18.080 --> 01:18:20.570
We closed out this semester
because we've lived

01:18:20.570 --> 01:18:22.890
it, the coronavirus crisis.

01:18:22.890 --> 01:18:25.340
And I think the
coronavirus crisis,

01:18:25.340 --> 01:18:27.770
beyond all these
huge challenges we

01:18:27.770 --> 01:18:30.470
have from a health care
and economic point of view,

01:18:30.470 --> 01:18:32.420
just putting it
back in the context

01:18:32.420 --> 01:18:34.400
of financial technology.

01:18:34.400 --> 01:18:36.470
I think startups are
going to have to focus,

01:18:36.470 --> 01:18:39.200
and are already focusing
on what we call runway,

01:18:39.200 --> 01:18:42.150
their burn rates, their cash,
their revenue, their adoption

01:18:42.150 --> 01:18:43.400
and so forth.

01:18:43.400 --> 01:18:45.890
Initial public offerings
are on hold in 2020,

01:18:45.890 --> 01:18:48.200
probably well into 2021.

01:18:48.200 --> 01:18:50.450
Venture capital
investment's already slowed

01:18:50.450 --> 01:18:54.440
and will continue to slow,
and valuations, thus, just

01:18:54.440 --> 01:18:59.150
inevitably need to decline
in this environment.

01:18:59.150 --> 01:19:03.200
And consolidation is
likely to increase.

01:19:03.200 --> 01:19:05.190
There's clearly going to
be winners and losers.

01:19:05.190 --> 01:19:07.880
I'm not saying anything
terribly important there.

01:19:07.880 --> 01:19:09.110
But the sectors matter.

01:19:09.110 --> 01:19:12.080
Some sectors related
to compliance,

01:19:12.080 --> 01:19:13.590
that might be pretty good.

01:19:13.590 --> 01:19:18.200
But if you're a sector related
to travel or entertainment

01:19:18.200 --> 01:19:21.260
or restaurants,
probably pretty bad.

01:19:21.260 --> 01:19:26.450
So beyond the sectors,
it's really back to runway.

01:19:26.450 --> 01:19:28.010
Now there are
opportunities serving

01:19:28.010 --> 01:19:31.690
the various fiscal stimulus
and loan programs in Europe,

01:19:31.690 --> 01:19:34.520
the US, Asia, elsewhere.

01:19:34.520 --> 01:19:37.550
I think the challenges are going
to mount in the next six to 18

01:19:37.550 --> 01:19:39.860
months around delinquencies.

01:19:39.860 --> 01:19:43.610
We haven't seen this hit hard
yet in the household sector.

01:19:43.610 --> 01:19:47.030
But it's inevitable, as
this crisis moves forward,

01:19:47.030 --> 01:19:49.490
that the household
sector is going to have

01:19:49.490 --> 01:19:51.930
to repair their balance sheets.

01:19:51.930 --> 01:19:53.900
And frankly, too,
many people will

01:19:53.900 --> 01:19:56.750
have to declare bankruptcy or
be in default or delinquency.

01:19:56.750 --> 01:20:01.540
The small business sector
that a lot of fintech startups

01:20:01.540 --> 01:20:05.450
supported will have to either
repair their balance sheets

01:20:05.450 --> 01:20:10.430
or go into delinquency and
default. So a lot of challenges

01:20:10.430 --> 01:20:11.540
around the startup deal.

01:20:11.540 --> 01:20:14.810
But I say this from my
time at Goldman Sachs.

01:20:14.810 --> 01:20:20.110
Challenging times also present
opportunities for all of us,

01:20:20.110 --> 01:20:23.845
for you as individuals,
and for these companies.

01:20:23.845 --> 01:20:25.970
I want to close on something
that Ben Franklin said

01:20:25.970 --> 01:20:29.750
long ago about money, and
it's about paying it forward.

01:20:29.750 --> 01:20:31.670
"I do not pretend
to give such a deed.

01:20:31.670 --> 01:20:33.950
I only lend it.

01:20:33.950 --> 01:20:36.830
When you meet with another
honest man in similar distress,

01:20:36.830 --> 01:20:41.450
you must pay me by lending
this sum to him or her,

01:20:41.450 --> 01:20:45.470
enjoining her to discharge
the debt by a like operation

01:20:45.470 --> 01:20:49.760
when she shall be able and shall
meet with another opportunity."

01:20:49.760 --> 01:20:51.530
This is Benjamin
Franklin on money.

01:20:51.530 --> 01:20:57.080
I would say it was fintech
of the 1770s to 1790s.

01:20:57.080 --> 01:21:00.800
"I hope it may us go
through many hands

01:21:00.800 --> 01:21:04.340
before it meets with a nave"--
nave is an old English word

01:21:04.340 --> 01:21:05.570
to say fool--

01:21:05.570 --> 01:21:08.510
"meet with a nave that
will stop its progress.

01:21:08.510 --> 01:21:11.120
This is a trick of mine
of doing a deal of good

01:21:11.120 --> 01:21:13.080
with a little money."

01:21:13.080 --> 01:21:17.270
So take this little homage,
this little sang of Benjamin

01:21:17.270 --> 01:21:19.250
Franklin, late 18th century.

01:21:19.250 --> 01:21:21.380
I call it fintech.

01:21:21.380 --> 01:21:24.020
And I ask you just
to do a little good,

01:21:24.020 --> 01:21:28.010
not just because we're in
these coronavirus times.

01:21:28.010 --> 01:21:31.250
But I've so enjoyed
being with the 80 or so

01:21:31.250 --> 01:21:33.800
of you these last 12 sessions.

01:21:33.800 --> 01:21:38.350
Do me the favor, six months
from now, 12 months from now,

01:21:38.350 --> 01:21:38.930
write me.

01:21:38.930 --> 01:21:40.080
Tell me where you are.

01:21:40.080 --> 01:21:42.170
Tell me you're
just safe and well.

01:21:42.170 --> 01:21:45.140
If you're graduating, tell
me that you got a job.

01:21:45.140 --> 01:21:48.230
If you didn't get a
job, ask career advice.

01:21:48.230 --> 01:21:50.030
If you're working in
the fintech space,

01:21:50.030 --> 01:21:52.130
tell me what you're doing
in the fintech space.

01:21:52.130 --> 01:21:53.020
I'd love to learn.

01:21:53.020 --> 01:21:56.470
I've learned so much
being your faculty member.

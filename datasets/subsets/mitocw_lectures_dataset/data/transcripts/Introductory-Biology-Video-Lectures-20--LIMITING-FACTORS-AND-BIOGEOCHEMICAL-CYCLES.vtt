00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
This lecture is going to be very
dependent upon the PowerPoint slides,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
because if I take the time to draw
the cycles on the board,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
we'd be here forever.  So I would
say sit back and relax because you

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
have the slides.
They're on the Web.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
And try to focus on what the
take-home message is.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
OK, but before we go on to
biogeochemical cycles,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
I want to just briefly review some
of the things that we learned in the

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
second lecture.
I got feedback from many of you,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
actually, on the things that were
difficult to understand from that

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
lecture, and those are important for
understanding these cycles.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
And the one thing that some people
were confused by was this anaerobic

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
respiration.  Remember,
I drew this on the board,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
and it showed a lot of reduction
reactions.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
And I think that was confusing for
some people, so let's just go over

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
that very quickly.
You've learned in Graham's lectures,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
and in my lectures,
that anaerobic respiration,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
respiration of organisms where there
is oxygen, that oxygen is the

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
terminal electron receptor here in
that electron transport chain and

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
it's reduced to water.
So in aerobic environments,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
when organisms respire oxygen it's
reduced to water.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
If there's no oxygen around,
the organisms, and in this case it's

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
always bacteria,
look for the next thermodynamically

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
favorable electron acceptor.
And so, whatever is dominant in

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
that environment and is most
thermodynamically favorable,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
they'll use.  So, the sulfate
reducing organisms use sulfate and

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
reduce at [H2S?
.  Denied trying denitrifying

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
organisms use nitrate and reduce it
to these forms of reduced nitrate or

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000
reduce nitrogen.
And we talked about iron bacteria

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
[epi?] plus three,
and reduce it to epi plus two.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Some can use manganese, etc.
Whatever's there,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
and it's thermodynamically favorable,
they'll use.  OK,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
so that clarifies that.
Some of the people said,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
you kept talking about symmetry.
You kept talking about symmetry.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
I didn't see any symmetry, and in
hindsight I can understand why,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
because it just threw that out and I
didn't really point it out.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
So what I was talking about was as
we went through these processes,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000
you see here, these elements,
sulfate and nitrogen,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000
nitrate, are being reduced.
There are other processes,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
particularly chemosynthesis in which
these reduced compounds,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000
here's H2S and ammonia or be
oxidized.  So that's the symmetry

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000
that I was talking about.
And if you didn't have that,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
if all the organisms were reducing
things, the whole system would run

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000
down.  You have to have organisms
that are also oxidizing things.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
And that's a key component of all
of these, or not all of the

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000
biogeochemical cycles,
but particularly the cycles of

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
nitrogen and sulfur,
which have this [redox?

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000
chemistry.  So that's a symmetry
that I was talking about.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.000
OK, now so let's talk about how we
think about biogeochemical cycles.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Did you see the slide in the back?
Try to turn the lights off?  That

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:49.000
was a double question.
Can you see the slide in the back?

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:55.000
Yes?  OK.  So this is a generic map
of the components of biogeochemical

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:02.000
cycles.  And we can think of the
earth as a giant chemical factory in

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:08.000
the sense that has what we call
compartments, or reservoirs,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:14.000
or pools of a particular element.
Or it might be water that we are

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.000
analyzing, and then there are fluxes
between these pools.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000
So here's a flux, an arrow.
So typically these are diagrammed

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.000
with boxes and arrows connecting
them.  And you don't have to use all

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.000
of these boxes.
It could be we are just looking at

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
land, atmosphere,
and ocean.  I mean,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000
you can construct whatever model you
want cities.  And these are just

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.000
some useful conversion factors for
the amount of things that we're

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000
going to have flowing between these
compartments.  And here,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000
again, this is something we defined
earlier when we were talking about

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000
productivity.  The main residence
time of, say, an element,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000
say, carbon in the terrestrial
biomass, is the pool size,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000
the amount of carbon that they're
divided by the mean flux in or out

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.000
of the pool, OK?
It's exactly the same concept we

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000
talked about for carbon.
And then the fractional turnover,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000
one over the mean residence time is
simply the fraction.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000
If we're talking about carbon again
in trees, it's the fraction that's

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.000
removed per unit time.
OK, so you can see that when we talk

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.000
about mean residence time of an
element  in one of these reservoirs,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.000
if the whole system is in a steady
state, in other words,

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.000
if the amount in a reservoir is
changing, the flux in is going to be

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:50.000
the same as the flux out,
right?  You know that.  Just like a

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000
bathtub, if you have water flowing
in, water flowing out,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000
the level will say the same if the
flow rate and is the same

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.000
as the flow rate out.
But often in nature,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000
you don't have that exactly.
And if you don't, the size of these

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000
reservoirs is either increasing or
decreasing.  So when you're

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000
analyzing these systems,
your most of the time trying to get

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.000
the very rough estimate of main
residence time.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000
So if the flow in and the flow out
isn't the same,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000
you can either average them and use
that as your flux,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000
or you could define your residence
time with respect to the flow

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.000
in or the flow out.
So, these are just gross

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.000
approximations.
What we want to understand is the

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.000
residence time thousands of years,
millions of years, days, rough

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000
approximation.
And the other thing I want to say

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000
before we go on,
is that all of these cycles,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.000
we're going to talk about them
element by element: phosphorus,

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.000
carbon, whatever.
But they're all tightly coupled in

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:08.000
the system.  And we'll bring that up
again later.  Before we go on,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:14.000
let's just look at the solar energy
budget, which is driving this whole

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.000
system, mostly,
there is some geothermal energy,

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:24.000
energy for the Earth's, the magma
that is also driving biogeochemical

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:30.000
cycles.  But the solar energy is the
primary driver.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.000
And if you say that the total energy
from the sun is 100%,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.000
it's that energy that is used in
evaporation, and winds,

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.000
and photosynthesis that is the
important component driving the

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:50.000
cycles.  And you'll see that
photosynthesis is a tiny fraction.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:56.000
The energy that plants harvest is a
tiny fraction of the total energy

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:01.000
that is driving the Earth's system.
And yet, this photosynthesis, which

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:06.000
is the basis of the biosphere,
has an enormous effect on the

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:11.000
conditions on Earth.
That's an interesting nonlinearity

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000
of the system.
OK, so let's start with the

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000
geological cycle,
which is the slowest moving,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:24.000
people don't even think of it as a
cycle because while we are on Earth

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000
we don't see rocks flying through,
well, sometimes you see rocks in a

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000
landslide or whatever,
but for the most part you don't

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:37.000
think of rocks as cycling.
But they do.  And if they didn't,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.000
the system would run down much
faster than it is.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.000
And we've all heard about plate
tectonics, that the surface of the

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000
Earth is made up of these plates
that are slowly shifting.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000
And when they shift you have
earthquakes, like we've had recently

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000
a lot of.  And also,
you have volcanic eruptions that

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000
bring material from the inside of
the Earth up to the surface

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.000
and it overflows.
And that's part of this geological

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.000
cycle.  So, here's a really
oversimplified,

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:14.000
when the geology professor in our
department so that ever showing this

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000
he had a heart attack by how
simplified it is.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:23.000
But it's just so you get the idea.
When he started editing it, there

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000
are so many arrows you can never
cope with that.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:32.000
But just get the idea.
There's geothermal energy coming in

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:37.000
from the inner core of the Earth
where you have magma.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.000
Think volcanic eruption,
lava, which ultimately becomes

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.000
surface rocks.
And they're eroded by weathering by

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000
rain, and then elements from that go
into the soils.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:54.000
Soils eventually become sedimentary
rocks.  We're talking over really,

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000
really long time periods, which
become metamorphic rocks.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000
Some of those are uplifted,
and some of them are melted and

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.000
become magma.
But it is a cycle,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:12.000
a very, very slow cycle.
In fact, somewhere I read 70%,

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:18.000
you do not need to know this.  This
is not geology class.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:23.000
But just so you have an idea,
75% of the rocks now on the surface

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:29.000
of the earth have been uplifted.
So it's almost as if the Earth is,

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:35.000
on average, maybe halfway through a
cycle.  So, this erosion here,

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:42.000
and weathering, as we talked about
last time is critical for making

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:49.000
nutrients available to the biosphere.
And the force of this weathering is

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:55.000
incredibly powerful.
One number that I found it one

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:02.000
textbook that I never knew before is
that Niagara Falls is eroding at 3

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:09.000
feet per year.
The cusp of the falls from the water

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:15.000
is moving back 3 feet per year.
That's fast.  Another little

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:22.000
factoid when I gave this lecture one
year, students asked what is going

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:28.000
to burn out first on the Earth,
the sun or the geothermal energy?

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:34.000
And of course I have no idea.
We over someday.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000
The Earth is going to be history
because without the sun and without

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.000
the geothermal energy there's no
source of energy.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:47.000
So I went to my colleagues in this
department, Earth Atmosphere and

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.000
Planetary Sciences,
and said, which is going to burn out

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000
first?  And they said,
roughly the same time.  And we have

00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:00.000
about 2 billion years,
so not to worry yet.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000
But it is, we are only here for a
period of time.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000
So, that's the geologic cycle.
Now, let's move onto the water

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000
cycle, and then we're going to go
through the element cycles of

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:17.000
nitrogen, phosphorus,
and carbon.  But the water cycle is

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.000
obviously important in carrying
those elements through their cycles.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.000
And the cycle is actually fairly
well understood.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.000
As a fairly because not all of
these things, when you're talking

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:34.000
about global averages of things it's
very difficult.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:39.000
But the weather service is very
interested in the global water cycle.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:44.000
So there's been a lot of study done.
So in terms of reservoirs,

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:49.000
these numbers of black at the amount
of water in a reservoir.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:54.000
And the numbers and blue are the
number of fluxes annually of the

00:12:54.000 --> 00:13:00.000
amounts of water moving
from one to another.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:05.000
So, there is a lot of water and
groundwater.  There's a lot of water

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:10.000
and ice, and there's a lot of water
in the oceans.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:15.000
And there's very little water in
the atmosphere.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:20.000
These are the annual fluxes.
So you can see, if I animated this

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:25.000
right, so 111,
these are in terms of square

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:30.000
kilometers of water,
that's a lot of water.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:35.000
So, 111 minus 71 gives you 40.
So that's the rainfall.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.000
This is the evapotranspiration,
and the net result is 40,000 that is

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000
flowing into the oceans.
And in the oceans, here's the

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:48.000
evaporation and here's the rainfall
going in with just a net of 40

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000
that's transported from the oceans
to land.  So you have 40,

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000
00 going into the oceans, and 40,
00 coming back, fairly nicely

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:05.000
balanced.  That's good.
And so, let's just use this as an

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:17.000
example to say,
what's the residence time of water.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:30.000
Let's just calculate this.  We can
just approximated.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:42.000
So the mean residence time is equal
to the pool size divided by the flux,

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:55.000
right?  So what's the pool size?
Well, how much water there in the

00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:06.000
ocean?
Thank you.  [35?

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:15.000
times 109.  And,
what's the flux?

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:31.000
Well, we have 425,

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:40.000
00 evaporating and we have 40 going
here.  So, I would add this and that

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:48.000
so it's balanced.
So, I would use 425.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:57.000
4.25 times 105 equals just roughly
how many years?  3,000

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:04.000
years roughly.
So we would say the residence time,

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:09.000
the average molecule, the average
water molecules floating through

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:14.000
this system would spend on average
thousands of years in the oceans

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:18.000
before it would evaporate and get
back into the system.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:23.000
So you should now think about what
the average residence time is,

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:28.000
for example, in the atmosphere.
And you can see when the pool is

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:33.000
very small relative to the fluxes,
the residence time is going to be

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:38.000
very short, right?
That's something to remember.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:42.000
When the pool is huge relative to
the fluxes, the residence time is

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.000
going to be very long.
So, you should think about that as

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.000
you go through your notes.
But, in oceans, the residence time

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:55.000
is thousands of years in groundwater.
The residence time,

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:59.000
again, can be very long,
which is why we don't want to

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:03.000
contaminate our groundwater because
it's going to take a really long

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:08.000
time to flush that through.
Lakes: the residence time is on the

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:13.000
order of decades,
streams on the order of weeks,

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:19.000
and atmosphere I'll let you
calculate it and figure it out.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:24.000
OK, let's move on now to an element
cycle, the global phosphorous

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:50.000
cycle.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:56.000
First of all, there's no [redox?
chemistry in the cycle.  That's

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:03.000
important.  OK,
that's the first thing to remember.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:09.000
And it's called a sedimentary cycle
because there is no atmospheric

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:15.000
component.  There is essentially no
phosphorus in the atmosphere.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:22.000
Everything in this field, there's
always an exception.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:28.000
There is something called phosphine
that comes out of bogs that is

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:35.000
really interesting.
But it's not a huge amount,

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:41.000
so it doesn't really matter in this
analysis.  And,

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:47.000
let's look at it here.
We have a fair amount of phosphorus

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:53.000
in land plants.
And there's internal cycling here.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:19:00.000
We have the mining of phosphorus
from rocks.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:04.000
This is a fertilizer.
No, that's not a mine; that's a

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:08.000
house.  Sorry.
The mine is invisible.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.000
Here's the mine.  So, the
phosphorus is being mined.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:17.000
It's put on crops as fertilizer.
The crops are eaten by the people

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:21.000
in the house, and the phosphorus
ends up in sewage.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:25.000
Even if it's treated,
it ends up in the rivers,

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:30.000
and it ends up flowing into the
oceans.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:35.000
And there's a little bit in dust
transport here,

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:40.000
but if you look at this whole system,
it's basically the phosphorous cycle

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:46.000
is a one-way flow to the oceans.
The only return of the cycle is via

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:51.000
the sedimentary cycle where you go
from sediments.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:57.000
Those are sedimentary rocks until
you go to mineable rock

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:02.000
and through uplifting.
And this is on geological timescales.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:08.000
So, on the earth today,
the global phosphorous cycle is

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:13.000
really not a cycle.
It's a one-way flow to the oceans.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:18.000
Well, it's a cycle, but it's an
extremely unbalanced cycle because

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:24.000
eventually this one will come back.
It cycles very rapidly in the biota,

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:29.000
internal cycling in the ocean.
So, it comes of the river, it's

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:34.000
taken up by phytoplankton,
there you can buy zooplankton,

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:40.000
and then the phosphorus is excreted
or bacteria [UNINTELLIGIBLE] on dead

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:49.000
organisms take up the phosphorous.
It's excreted as organic phosphorous,

00:20:49.000 --> 00:21:02.000
and it cycles rapidly through
this system.  OK.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:15.000
So the other important feature of
this one way flow, and also

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:33.000
humans have altered.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:40.000
In other words,
humans are responsible for this,

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:47.000
basically, one-way flow by mining
the phosphorus and putting it into

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:54.000
the agricultural system.
OK, yeah, and there's the return

00:21:54.000 --> 00:22:01.000
flux.
OK, moving on to the nitrogen cycle,

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:07.000
which is much more complicated
because it is [redox?

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:14.000
chemistry, OK?  And, humans have
also had a major,

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:20.000
major, major effect on the global
nitrogen cycle.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:27.000
So, let's first look at the global
estrogen transformation.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:31.000
So this isn't a pools and fluxes
diagram.  This is a summary for you

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:36.000
of things you already know.
You already know this.  It just

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:40.000
looks different than what you
learned in the second lecture.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:45.000
So let's just go through it very
quickly.  If we think of the

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:50.000
compounds of nitrogen as being
either reduced or oxidized and we

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:54.000
think of the environment where they
might be found as either being

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:59.000
aerobic or oxic,
having oxygen, or anaerobic and oxic,

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:05.000
not having oxygen.
We can draw a schematic of these

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:11.000
processes that hopefully makes good
sense.  If we start with organic

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:17.000
nitrogen, but say it's a dead whale
that you saw is organic nitrogen,

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:23.000
bacteria work on it, and through
this process which you haven't

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:29.000
really learned about explicitly at,
can convert that to free ammonia.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:34.000
That ammonia can be used in
chemosynthesis,

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:40.000
which you learned about.
OK, the specific type of

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:45.000
chemosynthesis is called
nitrification,

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:51.000
where this ammonia is converted to
nitrite.  Is that an oxidation or a

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:56.000
reduction?  Shout it out.
Yes, yes.  It's an oxidation.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:02.000
This was obvious because you can
actually see the oxygen.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:06.000
So, in that, nitrite also in
chemosynthesis can be further

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:11.000
oxidized to nitrate.
And chemosynthesis, so this is an

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:16.000
energy releasing process for these
bacteria.  Now,

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:20.000
so here we now have nitrogen in an
oxidized form,

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:25.000
and we are in an anoxic environment,
and that should immediately tell you,

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:30.000
oh, that's an electron acceptor for
the anaerobic bacteria which are

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:35.000
going to dump their electrons on
this and convert it to NO or N2O.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:40.000
These are gases,
and nitrogen gas.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:45.000
This is denitrification or
anaerobic respiration,

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:50.000
which we already talked about.
And it also can be converted

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:55.000
through nitrogen fixation,
N2 gas can be converted to ammonia.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:00.000
We already talked about this,
too.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:04.000
Remember, bacteria and cyanobacteria
are the only organisms that can take

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:09.000
nitrogen gas from the atmosphere and
converted to ammonia for the use of

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:13.000
other organisms.
OK, and then there's one other

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:18.000
thing here which is called
assimilatory nitrate reduction.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:22.000
And that is when organisms just
take up nitrate,

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:27.000
and inside them, and they reduce it
so that they can,

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:31.000
they have to reduce it to ammonia in
order to reduce it for

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:38.000
protein synthesis.
So that's another route for nitrate

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:46.000
to become organic nitrogen in an
oxidized environment.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:54.000
So these are the important
biological transformations in the

00:25:54.000 --> 00:26:03.000
cycle.  So, here's the cycle in all
of its complexity.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:10.000
And redox is important.
That's a feature.  I'm going to

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:18.000
list these things,
and then we'll look at them on the

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:25.000
diagram, has a gaseous phase,
in other words, is an important

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:33.000
atmosphere component,
N2, NO, N2O, and by the way,

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:41.000
this is a very powerful greenhouse
gas.

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:52.000
So, the balance or imbalance in the
nitrogen cycle that results in more

00:26:52.000 --> 00:27:03.000
or less N2O is very important for
global climate regulation.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:29.000
Nitrogen fixation by microbes and
humans: very important.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:37.000
And denitrification by microbes is
the only way to return nitrogen to

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:45.000
the atmosphere.
If you didn't have denitrification,

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:54.000
this process that you learned in my
second lecture that you thought was

00:27:54.000 --> 00:28:02.000
just some weird way things get
through life, is incredibly

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:11.000
important in maintaining the global
nitrogen cycle.

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:18.000
So, let's look at this,
the details here.  So, in terms of

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:26.000
nitrogen fixation,
that's taking N2 gas and converting

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:33.000
it to ammonia.
Biological fixation by plants,

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:39.000
or it's really not by plants.  It's
by the symbiotic microbes in their

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:46.000
roots is 140 times 1012 of grams per
year.  The industrial electrician

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:52.000
fixation, that is,
what's done by humans,

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:59.000
there's a process called the Haber
process that's incredibly energy

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:05.000
intensive.  It takes a lot of fossil
fuel to break that nitrogen

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:11.000
triple bond.
In other words,

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:15.000
to take nitrogen gas and convert it
to ammonia, you have to break this

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:19.000
triple bond which is very energy
intensive.  But they figured that

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:23.000
out during World War II basically,
or was it World War I?  Anyway, one

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:27.000
of the wars, how to break that bond,
and that was the beginning of the

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:32.000
nitrogen fertilizer industry.
So, this is human nitrogen fixation

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:38.000
that is used to fertilize crops.
So this is a huge fraction of the

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:43.000
natural fixation.
I mean, this adds a huge amount of

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:49.000
nitrogen flux to the system.
OK, in this flux here, this is

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:54.000
cultivated legume.
So, this would be agricultural bean

00:29:54.000 --> 00:30:00.000
plants that naturally have nitrogen
fixers in them,

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:06.000
and that also import nitrogen into
the system.

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:12.000
So, we consider that part of the
human flux.  OK,

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:18.000
to balance this, we have
denitrification,

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:25.000
which as I said is done by microbes
on land and in the ocean.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:31.000
So, looking at this, is it balanced?
Is nitrogen fixation on a global

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:37.000
scale and denitrification balanced?
Did I hear a no?

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:43.000
Which is greater?
Denitrification, yeah.

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:48.000
If you add this, this, and this,
you get 260.  Is that right?  Yeah,

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:54.000
and then you add this, this, and
this you get 310.

00:30:54.000 --> 00:31:00.000
So, there's more nitrogen going
into the atmosphere than

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:06.000
we're taking out.
And people don't understand this.

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:13.000
They think the denitrification has
been disproportionately stimulated

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:19.000
by this huge flux of nitrogen into
the system.  But this is an

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:26.000
important imbalance that a lot of
people are studying very

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:32.000
hard.  OK, yeah.
That's the major feature that you

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:36.000
want to look at in the system.
And then, if we compare, this

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:41.000
figure is from your textbook
comparing the biological nitrogen

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:45.000
fixation.  Plus,
lightning fixes it a little bit.

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:50.000
Compared to the human, you can see
that humans are now responsible for

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:54.000
an equal amount of nitrogen flux on
a global scale as the natural system.

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:59.000
This is a dramatic perturbation,
and that's only in the last 50 years

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:04.000
or so, dramatic perturbation
to the system.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:09.000
This amount that we are doing is,
140 gigatons is equivalent to 10

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:15.000
million trucks of dry nitrogen
fertilizer that we are putting into

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:20.000
the system with completely unknown
effects.  OK, the next series of

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:26.000
slides are just to illustrate in one
ecosystem the importance of the

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:32.000
biota and maintaining nitrogen in
the ecosystem.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:35.000
And I'll also just show you the
importance of experiments in ecology.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:39.000
And this is the Hubbard Brook
Experimental Forest,

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:43.000
which is up in New Hampshire.
Some of you might have even visited

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:47.000
there.  This was my first job as a
graduate student was actually

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:50.000
working in the forest.
I was measuring phosphorous

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:54.000
concentrations in the streams.
And what they do there, just like

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:58.000
that experimental lake study I
showed you, here,

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:02.000
they have permits from the forest
service to clear cut

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:06.000
entire watersheds.
A watershed is just an area that

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:10.000
collects the rainfall and directs it
into a single stream.

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:14.000
You can collect the rain and
measure what's in it,

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:18.000
and you can collect the water coming
out and measure what's in it.

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:22.000
And the difference is what the
ecosystem is actually doing.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:26.000
So, what they did was they had
these two watersheds that were the

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:30.000
same, and they clear cut one of them.
And they asked with the influence

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:34.000
of this clear cutting was on the
quality of the water coming

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:38.000
out of the system.
And to make a long story very short,

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:42.000
it's a really fascinating study
that's been going on for four years

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:47.000
that I want to tell you because then
you'll know how old I am.

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:51.000
But, here's the control watershed,
and here's the water coming out of

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:56.000
the devegetated one,
showing massive [reflux?

00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:01.000
of nitrate from the system as well
as other cations.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:04.000
And your textbook does a terrible
job of not explaining this.

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:08.000
And I don't have time to go into
the details.  But,

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:12.000
the major reason this is lost,
the vegetation is really important

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:16.000
in that, but it's important in also
maintaining the microbial community

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:20.000
in the soil.  And when it's cut down,
the microbial community changes.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:24.000
And that is very important and
resulting in the loss.

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:28.000
It's a beautiful study,
which unfortunately we don't have

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:32.000
time to go into.
But if you're interested,

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:36.000
I can point you in the right
direction.  OK,

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:40.000
now, let's go into the really
important, well,

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:44.000
they're all important because
they're all coupled.

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:48.000
But this is the one that's getting
a lot of attention,

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:52.000
the global carbon cycle.
And it's getting a lot of attention

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:56.000
because we have had an incredibly
significant impact on it,

00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:01.000
and we are worried about that
causing major global warming.

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:05.000
And as an aside,
I'll just tell you that I actually

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:10.000
think the global nitrogen cycle is a
sleeping giant,

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:14.000
and that the public doesn't know
much about that right now.

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:19.000
But in the scientific community,
we know the perturbation we've had

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:23.000
on that cycle could end up being
equally, if not more,

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:28.000
traumatic for the Earth's climate as
this.  But that's an aside.

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:33.000
So let's focus on this now.
So, here's the global not carbon

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:38.000
cycle, which you've seen now several
times in my lectures.

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:43.000
So here's gross primary
productivity, and respiration by

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:48.000
land plants, respiration by the
soils.  These are RA and RH that we

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:53.000
talked about before.
And in this, we have their balance,

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:58.000
roughly balanced, and then you have
uptake by the oceans,

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:03.000
and loss of CO2 by the oceans.
Your textbook says this is all a

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:07.000
physical and chemical process that's
absolutely wrong.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:11.000
The biota are central to that,
and that's another lecture.  But you

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:15.000
already know that,
that the phytoplankton are sucking a

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:20.000
lot of CO2 in through photosynthesis.
So let's look at the budget here.

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:24.000
And, this is the introduction of
CO2 into the atmosphere by burning

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:28.000
fossil fuel, and the introduction of
CO2 into the atmosphere by

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:34.000
destruction of vegetation.
So, we have 7.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:42.000
gigatons going into the atmosphere
due to human perturbation.

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:49.000
The annual increase of CO2 in the
atmosphere is 3.

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:57.000
gigatons.  So, 3.
gigatons annual increase,

00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:03.000
and, let's see.
If we look at the difference here

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:07.000
between respiration and
photosynthesis we see that there's 2

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:11.000
gigatons going into the vegetation,
actually net into the vegetation.

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:15.000
And if we look at this,
we see that there's two going into

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:19.000
the ocean.  So,
if we ask, of all of this

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:23.000
anthropogenic CO2 where's it going?
3.5 is going to increase in the

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:27.000
atmosphere.  Two is going to
vegetation, and two is

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:33.000
going to the ocean.
And it's this that we are very

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:39.000
concerned about because it's causing
a dramatic increase in the CO2 in

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:45.000
the atmosphere.
Even though these are tiny fluxes

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:51.000
relative to the global biological
fluxes, these tiny fluxes lead to a

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:57.000
significant increase because the
pool is so small of CO2

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:02.000
in the atmosphere.
So, this is a trace of CO2 since

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:06.000
1960.  Here's a question for you to
think about.  I'm not going to

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:11.000
answer it.  Its summer and winter
are out of phase in the Northern and

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:15.000
Southern Hemisphere,
why isn't this just smooth?

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:19.000
This cycle that we see here is an
annual cycle of the Earth breathing.

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:24.000
Remember I showed you that the
first lecture showing photosynthesis

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:28.000
greater than respiration during the
summer, and the reverse

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:33.000
during the winter.
Think about why it isn't just smooth

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:38.000
and canceled out by the two
hemispheres.  OK,

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:42.000
and if we look at that same graph,
this is atmospheric CO2 from ice

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:47.000
core data as a function of time.
This is today, and this is time

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:52.000
before present going backwards.
This is 450,000 years ago.  We can

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:56.000
see that CO2 in the atmosphere,
and this is measured in, you take a

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:01.000
deep ice core in Greenland,
or something, and you measure the

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:06.000
CO2 concentration at different
slices of the core.

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:11.000
And it tells you what the Earth was
like back then.

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:16.000
And, this just dramatically shows
you what we are doing just that the

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:21.000
last hundred years.
We have increased CO2 in the

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:26.000
atmosphere dramatically by burning
fossil fuels.  And CO2 is a

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:31.000
greenhouse gas,
and so we are very concerned about

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:36.000
that.
OK, this is just read showing that

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:40.000
slide from last time of upwelling to
remind you that the biogeochemical

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:45.000
cycles of these elements are tightly
coupled.  Remember,

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:49.000
we talked about nutrients,
nitrogen, phosphorus, being upwelled

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:54.000
from the deep water,
phytoplankton taking them up,

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:58.000
drawing down CO2 and then we had
oxygen and CO2 going back

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:03.000
and forth in the water.
So, the oxygen cycle,

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:09.000
which we haven't even talked about
is tightly coupled also to the CO2

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:14.000
cycle.  I'm not going to show this
there.  OK, moving on,

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:19.000
and I know this is quick,
but this is in your readings.

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:25.000
There is a newspaper article about
the Biosphere 2 experiment which now

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:30.000
is pretty dated.
To make a long story short,

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:36.000
many years ago a very rich person
built the system out in the middle

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:41.000
of the Arizona desert.
And it had seven ecosystems in it.

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:45.000
It was sealed.  It was closed.  And,
he put people at,

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:49.000
which were called biospherians,
and the idea was to see whether

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:54.000
humans could create a closed
biosphere that would sustain human

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:58.000
life.  And, it was a miserable
failure, which is sad because it

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:02.000
costs a lot of money,
and has since been taken over by

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:07.000
Columbia University to use it as an
experimental facility.

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:11.000
But the one thing that they learned,
here's what happened.  They put the

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:16.000
people in.  And it turned out that
there was not enough photosynthesis

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:21.000
to supply enough oxygen for the
people to breathe.

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:25.000
Oxygen levels steadily went down.
And the reason for that, they

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:30.000
learned later,
was that they had put way too much

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:35.000
rich soil in the system.
So, the bacteria in the soil were

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:39.000
sucking the oxygen out of the
atmosphere.  And there were

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:44.000
subsidizing the system with rich
soil so that people would have

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:49.000
enough food.  But there was a puzzle,
because if this was the case,

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:53.000
because the cycles are coupled,
you should expect to see the same

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:58.000
amount of, if this oxygen is coming
from photosynthesis,

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:03.000
you should see the same amount of
CO2 coming into the system.

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:07.000
And you should see an increase in
CO2 in the atmosphere.

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:11.000
And they didn't.  In other words,
they saw oxygen going down, but they

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:16.000
didn't see surplus CO2 in the
atmosphere.  And it took a bright

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:20.000
graduate student from Columbia
University to go in there and figure

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:25.000
out what was going on.
And it turned out that,

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:29.000
so why didn't CO2 increase?
It turned out that this CO2,

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:34.000
which was coming out of the system
from respiration in the soil was

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:38.000
actually binding to the calcium
hydroxide in the cement and making

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:43.000
calcium carbonate.
So, the cement,

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:47.000
another human invention,
was playing an important role here.

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:51.000
The point is that none of this,
this is only understandable in

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:55.000
hindsight, because it didn't work.
You can go in and figure out, what

00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:59.000
the heck, where did these imbalances
come from?  So,

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:03.000
it was a very interesting study,
and we learned that it's not easy to

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:08.000
mimic natural biosphere
on a very small scale.

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:12.000
OK, I'm going to skip that one,
and come to this real quickly,

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:17.000
because this was just on the news
this morning as I was driving into

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:22.000
work.  I thought,
perfect for this lecture.

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:27.000
The UN just announced this
millennium ecosystem assessment.

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:32.000
It's on the web.
And 2,000 scientists have been

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:36.000
working on this for over ten years
trying to assess the state of the

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:40.000
global ecosystems and their
capability to support future

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:44.000
generations, i.
. you guys.  And they say the next

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:49.000
50 years, and those are the 50 years
that you guys are in charge,

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:53.000
are absolutely critical for whether
or not these systems will sustain,

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:57.000
be able to sustain human populations.
So you can go to the web if you're

00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:02.000
interested in that.
OK, quickly to our civil and

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:06.000
environmental engineering major,
I'm just going to say that our new

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:11.000
motto is nature,
tools, and toys, that nature is

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:16.000
ecology.  There is a two series
ecology course.

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:20.000
Tools are mechanics: basics,
fundamentals for analyzing systems.

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:25.000
And toys is design.  The part of
the curriculum is going to be

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:30.000
designing instrumentation for
studying environmental systems.

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:35.000
And there are these brochures here
and in the back.

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:40.000
So I encourage you to pick those up
if you're at all interested in that

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:45.000
major.  Now, let me show you this
cool clip.  Don't leave yet.

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:51.000
This is worth it.  It's only two
minutes, and its nature at its best.

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:56.000
So, all I need to do here is hit
play.  And this is the soccer

00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:02.000
player's look like this.
Oh, why didn't that work.

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:22.000
[Miophon?] our little

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:51.000
bugs in the sand.

00:45:51.000 --> 00:46:08.000
That's my favorite part.

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:21.000
Life is a geological agent.

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:25.000
See, that would have been a great
kick off for spring break,

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:30.000
but welcome back from spring break.
All right, I'll see you in a few

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:33.000
weeks.

00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:05.000
In this segment we will go
very fast through a few

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.220
definitions and facts
that remain true in

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:08.620
the continuous case.

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:10.370
Everything is completely
analogous to

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:11.690
the discrete case.

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:14.850
And there are absolutely
no surprises here.

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:18.810
So, for example, we have defined
joint PMFs for the

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.600
case of more than two discrete
random variables.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.630
And we have a bunch of
facts about them.

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.390
In a similar manor, we can
define joint PDFs for more

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.020
than two random variables.

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.820
And if you have understood the
material so far, you can guess

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.490
how such a joint PDF
will be used.

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:39.780
For example, you can calculate
the probability of a three

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:46.310
dimensional set by integrating
the joint PDF over that three

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:47.950
dimensional set.

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:51.540
And there are analogs off all of
the other formulas that we

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.750
have here where we follow
the usual recipe.

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:02.160
Sums become integrals, and PMFs
are replaced by PDFs.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.860
Finally, when you deal with a
random variable, which is

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.940
defined as a function of jointly
continuous random

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:13.480
variables, we can use an
expected value rule that takes

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.280
the same form as in
the discrete case.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.950
And using the expected value
rule, we can establish, once

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.820
more, the usual linearity
properties of expectations.

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.620
So absolutely no
surprises here.

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.950
The derivations are either
completely straightforward.

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.490
Or they follow exactly the same
line of argument as in

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.590
the discrete case, with just
minor changes in notation.

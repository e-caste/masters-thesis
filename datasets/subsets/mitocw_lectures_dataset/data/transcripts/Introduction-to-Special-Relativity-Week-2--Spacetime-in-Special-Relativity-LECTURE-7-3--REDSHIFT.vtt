00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.360
MARKUS KLUTE:
Welcome back to 8.20.

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.390
In the previous section, we have
seen the relativistic Doppler

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.170
effect, and now we want
to study how light--

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.970
in this case, a
monochromatic plane wave--

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.950
transforms in the
Lorentz transformation.

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:33.350
In other words, we have,
for example, a distant star

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.470
emitting light at a
specific frequency.

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:40.440
The question now is, how
do we observe this light

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.840
when the star is traveling
away from us or towards us?

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:50.990
So here you see our
monochromatic plane wave.

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:54.120
We have an amplitude A and
then just a simple cosine,

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.770
which is a function
of x, y, and t, time.

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:59.900
This is the solution
of the wave equation,

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.575
and we have already seen
this as part of the p

00:01:02.575 --> 00:01:05.970
sets, but also
discussed in class.

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.050
So the wave is characterized
by so-called wave numbers

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:12.320
in x direction and y direction.

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.380
The squared sum-- the square
root of the squared sum

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.630
is the so-called wave number.

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.230
The frequency omega
is equal to 2 pi f,

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:23.940
where f is the frequency and
omega is the angular frequency.

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.615
And if you divide the angular
frequency by the wave number,

00:01:26.615 --> 00:01:27.740
you get the speed of light.

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.180
Similarly, you can multiply the
frequency and the wavelength.

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.070
OK, so as a first
activity, I will

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:40.630
ask you to see that how
does this solution, how

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.640
does this specific wave,
transform on the Lorentz

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:44.410
transformation?

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:46.900
As a reminder, we have seen
that the equation which

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.380
governs how this
light propagates

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.630
is [INAUDIBLE] the
Lorentz transformation.

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:54.160
But now we want to
investigate what

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.060
happens to the wave itself.

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.590
OK?

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:04.710
So we have to investigate this
specific solution and Lorentz

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.570
transform x and t.

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:12.250
And I just do this
here in this equation.

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:18.140
So you see that now we
have, as part of the cosine,

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:26.810
Kx gamma x prime plus beta
ct prime plus no change in y

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.495
direction as we look at
the Lorentz transformation

00:02:29.495 --> 00:02:33.020
in x direction, and then we have
the transformation of the time

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.890
axis.

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:34.700
OK?

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.420
So now this looks very
cumbersome or complicated,

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.250
but we can try to refind the
very same characterization

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.050
of the wave as we had before.

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:48.980
How does now the transformed
wave number look like or does

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.030
the frequency look like
after Lorentz transformation?

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.400
And so we want to identify
the individual terms Kx prime,

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:02.260
where we label Kx
prime as the parameter

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.570
you find here in the solution,
in this Lorentz transform

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:08.890
solution, and we do the
same for omega prime,

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:11.660
and you find a solution here.

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:16.210
So now there's
this angle cosine I

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:19.870
defined as the angle with
respect to the line of motion.

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.500
Omega prime is now the baseline
frequency and omega the one

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:24.550
which is detected.

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:30.340
That's just a matter of
changing the direction of beta

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:31.880
with the plus and minus sign.

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:36.200
But if we use that definition,
we can now discuss the result.

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.390
So as part of the discussion,
we can look at the specific case

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.340
where the wave is
moving towards us.

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.840
OK?

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.490
So zeta is equal to 0
and beta is positive.

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:55.310
In this case, omega is
larger than omega prime.

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:59.370
And so the frequency
is going to be higher.

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.440
So the detected frequency is
going to be higher blueshifted.

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:07.250
So if you have a situation that
a star is moving up towards us

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:10.070
and emitting light, the light
is detected by us, maybe

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:12.920
by our eyes or by a
telescope, that light

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.110
is going to be blueshifted.

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:17.959
It's going to go to
higher frequencies.

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:24.580
The opposite scenario is where
zeta is equal to 180 degrees

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.183
and beta equal to--

00:04:26.183 --> 00:04:27.850
greater than 0, or
the other way around.

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:29.500
We could have defined
this also as zeta

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.910
equals 0 and beta negative.

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:38.280
In this case, omega is
smaller than omega prime.

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.130
So the frequency
is lower, meaning

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:43.230
that the light we
observe is redshifted.

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:45.810
And therefore,
this term redshift

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:49.380
is a measure of whether
or not the source of light

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:51.660
is moving towards
us or away from us.

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:54.570
And the larger the redshift,
the higher the velocity

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:57.720
is of this object
moving away from us.

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:01.830
So we can define this redshift
as the relative change

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:05.970
in frequency omega prime
minus omega over omega,

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:08.810
or we can define 1 plus
Z, 1 plus the redshift

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:12.870
is omega prime over omega,
which is square root of 1

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:16.780
plus beta over 1 minus beta.

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:17.770
All right?

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:21.290
So if you now observe
the stars in our galaxy,

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:23.060
and you can do
this, for example,

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:25.705
by its specific spectral form.

00:05:25.705 --> 00:05:27.850
There are the specific
spectral lines,

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:31.000
lines of specific
frequency, which

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.150
we can observe
from stars as they

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:37.730
are in certain distance
from our solar system.

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:41.110
And if we do this, we basically
see all stars being redshifted,

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:44.590
meaning all stars are actually
moving away from us, which

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:49.560
is a measure of the fact that
the universe is expanding.

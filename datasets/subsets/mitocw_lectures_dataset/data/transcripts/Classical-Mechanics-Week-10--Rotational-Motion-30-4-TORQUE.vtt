00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:04.160
Let's think about
calculating torque.

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.240
I have a force, F, being
applied to an object.

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.140
And that object is
pivoted at a point,

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:14.165
Q. I'll define R as the vector
from the pivot point, Q,

00:00:14.165 --> 00:00:18.080
to the point of the
application of the force.

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.430
Torque is defined as the
cross product, R cross F,

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:25.040
which we can also
write as R times F

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.290
times the sine of theta.

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:29.600
But what does that mean?

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.270
I'll introduce two different
intuitive ways of understanding

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.340
this mathematical expression.

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.000
First, we can think about this
as the magnitude of F times

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.940
the quantity, R sine theta.

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:42.920
If we look at the
direction of the force,

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.010
then it is easy to
see there R sine theta

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:51.250
is just the part of R that is
perpendicular to the force.

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.940
So here the torque is
equal to the magnitude

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.070
of the force,
times the magnitude

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.250
of this perpendicular
part of the vector R.

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.070
This perpendicular portion
of the distance vector R

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.420
is often referred to
as the moment arm.

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.039
We can instead group
F with sine theta.

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:13.320
So this means that we're
thinking of the cross-product

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.400
as the distance R
multiplied by F sine theta.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.830
The component of
the force F, that's

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.320
perpendicular to the
position vector R.

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.090
Here I'm calculating
torque as the distance

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.000
between the pivot point, and
where the force is applied,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.490
times the perpendicular
part of the force.

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.000
Be very careful about
the sine theta term.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.180
In many cases the angle theta
that is given in the problem

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.450
is not the angle that is
used in the expression.

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.280
In this example, F
times the sine of theta,

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.650
will actually give the parallel
component of the force.

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:54.330
Therefore it is much
better to remember

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.270
to take the perpendicular
component, rather than just

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.564
memorizing sine of theta.

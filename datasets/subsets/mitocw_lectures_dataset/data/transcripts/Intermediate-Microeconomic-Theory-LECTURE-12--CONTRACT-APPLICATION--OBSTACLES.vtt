00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:14.990 align:middle line:84%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Thanks,
everyone, for coming today.

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:18.680 align:middle line:84%
So first thing I
wanted to do is just

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:24.440 align:middle line:84%
review where we are, as usual,
in terms of the calendar.

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:29.180 align:middle line:84%
So we did the first part of
contracts and mechanism design

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:31.730 align:middle line:84%
as kind of an
introduction last time.

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:33.590 align:middle line:84%
And now we're going to
do the second, which

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.590 align:middle line:84%
is very explicit about
another application

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:38.870 align:middle line:90%
beyond medieval villages.

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.990 align:middle line:84%
And we'll definitely have
real, live data and so on.

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:48.410 align:middle line:84%
And then by Thursday, we will
get into general Equilibrium,

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.800 align:middle line:84%
again, Walraisian
worlds, and begin

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.880 align:middle line:84%
to look at trade applications
both in emerging markets

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.640 align:middle line:90%
and then later in the US.

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.860 align:middle line:84%
I'll say a little bit
about the reading list,

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.170 align:middle line:84%
especially since
you might miss this.

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:05.840 align:middle line:84%
The paper application that
we're going to feature today

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:12.320 align:middle line:84%
is this paper with my
coauthors on five villages.

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.280 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to both
stress the application using

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.090 align:middle line:84%
the tools you've already
learned in a different context

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.100 align:middle line:90%
but also some of the techniques.

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.350 align:middle line:84%
Remember, the class
is trying to balance

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.500 align:middle line:84%
both learning tools and
how to use them as well

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.990 align:middle line:84%
as the economics so please don't
miss this Karaivanov starred

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.580 align:middle line:84%
article, including moral
hazard programs with lotteries

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.000 align:middle line:84%
because I will say a lot
about those techniques today

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.260 align:middle line:90%
but not enough.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.560 align:middle line:90%
So there's two starred articles.

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.470 align:middle line:84%
Again, I have earmarked
a few of these

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.540 align:middle line:90%
from what we did last time.

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:54.410 align:middle line:84%
For mechanism design,
we did a single period.

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:57.840 align:middle line:84%
We worked through the
so-called revelation principle.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.980 align:middle line:84%
And finally, we got to
a two-period problem.

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:03.770 align:middle line:84%
And the review question
is written here

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.080 align:middle line:84%
is, now maintaining
the lotteries,

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.270 align:middle line:84%
write down the programming
problem for the two

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:10.130 align:middle line:90%
periods, dates one and two.

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.590 align:middle line:84%
I'm not asking you to
literally write it down.

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.990 align:middle line:84%
But could someone
volunteer to tell me

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:17.090 align:middle line:84%
about the truth-telling
constraints

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.780 align:middle line:84%
at the final date two, in
words, what they look like?

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.520 align:middle line:84%
And then also in words, what the
true telling constraint of date

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.370 align:middle line:90%
one looks like.

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.910 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: I remember the
truth-telling constraint

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.680 align:middle line:84%
at the final entry is that
no matter what you already

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:44.060 align:middle line:84%
announce at the date 1, based
on the [INAUDIBLE] how would you

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:49.820 align:middle line:84%
announce at the date
1, you want to choose--

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:57.276 align:middle line:84%
The truth-telling bring
you the maximized utility.

00:02:57.276 --> 00:03:03.280 align:middle line:84%
[INAUDIBLE] function is like
the utility at the date two

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:14.110 align:middle line:84%
is the [INAUDIBLE] and
which modify the probability

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.980 align:middle line:90%
function.

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:16.960 align:middle line:84%
The probability
function was depending

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:20.500 align:middle line:84%
on what you announce
in the [INAUDIBLE] one.

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:25.150 align:middle line:84%
And then the whole
function would be bigger

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.410 align:middle line:84%
than any announcement
at the [INAUDIBLE]..

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.750 align:middle line:90%


00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:36.800 align:middle line:84%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: OK, and
what about at date one?

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.910 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: The date one
is that you do not only

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:47.120 align:middle line:84%
care about what you
will get at this moment.

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.030 align:middle line:84%
But you also care
about the future.

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:56.780 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that for date one,
the maximize the utility.

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:00.940 align:middle line:84%
Not maximize, the
you're telling the truth

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.290 align:middle line:84%
that bring you
the utility, which

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:10.240 align:middle line:90%
is larger than any date 1.

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:14.500 align:middle line:84%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yeah, and what
is it assuming about date two,

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:19.269 align:middle line:84%
even though it's a
date one constraint?

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:21.944 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Assuming about
the date two is that it--

00:04:21.944 --> 00:04:25.660 align:middle line:90%


00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:27.990 align:middle line:84%
The date two not
care about what--

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:29.700 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.982 align:middle line:90%
They do not care.

00:04:31.982 --> 00:04:33.690 align:middle line:84%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yeah,
you're very close.

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:37.020 align:middle line:84%
So the point of working
backwards, at date two,

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.270 align:middle line:84%
we get the truth-telling
constraint.

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.670 align:middle line:84%
So the utility is greater
for telling the truth

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:44.490 align:middle line:84%
and announcing something
counterfactual.

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:49.590 align:middle line:84%
That's now imposed as part of
the solution as a constraint.

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:53.120 align:middle line:84%
So working back to
date one, it assumes

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.850 align:middle line:90%
truth telling at date two.

00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:00.020 align:middle line:84%
So we only have to worry about
whether to be truthful at date

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:04.760 align:middle line:90%
one or lie at date one.

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:07.940 align:middle line:84%
Because whatever they do,
truth or lie at date one,

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:11.450 align:middle line:84%
they will tell the
truth that date two.

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:15.800 align:middle line:84%
So related to all of
this is the message,

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.330 align:middle line:90%
the announcement of date one.

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:19.700 align:middle line:84%
You said something
not quite right.

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:21.530 align:middle line:90%
But I may have heard it wrong.

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:24.740 align:middle line:84%
There's a probability
transition function

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:27.410 align:middle line:84%
that has to do with a
probability of states

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:30.470 align:middle line:84%
at date two, conditioned
on dates at state one.

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:31.860 align:middle line:90%
And that never changes.

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:34.480 align:middle line:84%
That's just part
of the environment.

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:38.640 align:middle line:84%
What changes, until the
one that you mentioned,

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:42.480 align:middle line:84%
is the message at date one,
depending on whether or not the

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:43.170 align:middle line:90%
total the truth.

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:46.310 align:middle line:90%


00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:51.470 align:middle line:84%
So the very last part
of this review question

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:55.940 align:middle line:84%
asks to describe
the way in which

00:05:55.940 --> 00:06:01.410 align:middle line:84%
past history matters or
contemporary outcomes.

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:05.060 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: So the key is
that the history matters,

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:07.670 align:middle line:90%
the probability function, right?

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:10.520 align:middle line:90%
Because if you're telling the--

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:13.310 align:middle line:84%
Whatever you tell at
the date one, that

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:19.100 align:middle line:84%
will decide the probability
because the probability was

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:24.262 align:middle line:84%
conditioning on what are you are
telling, what do you announce.

00:06:24.262 --> 00:06:25.720 align:middle line:84%
ROBERT TOWNSEND:
So I don't think I

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.220 align:middle line:90%
have that lecture open anymore.

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:30.070 align:middle line:84%
We'd have to go
back and look at it.

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:33.480 align:middle line:90%


00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:36.090 align:middle line:84%
No, it's buried
back deeper in them.

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:38.430 align:middle line:84%
Go back and look at
the Markov Process.

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:42.720 align:middle line:84%
The probability P of theta
2, condition on theta 1,

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:44.010 align:middle line:90%
there's never--

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:45.810 align:middle line:90%
That part never changes.

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:46.680 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Oh, sorry.

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:48.030 align:middle line:90%
I'm mixing it.

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:49.380 align:middle line:90%
I should say the lottery.

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:50.790 align:middle line:90%
I always say the probability.

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:51.630 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:54.240 align:middle line:84%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: OK,
OK, yeah, lottery.

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:55.740 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, they're both
probabilities.

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:56.940 align:middle line:90%
I understand.

00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:58.050 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:06:58.050 --> 00:06:58.830 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:00.150 align:middle line:90%
That's perfect.

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:05.840 align:middle line:84%
OK, and then relatedly, there's
this question right afterwards,

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:09.840 align:middle line:84%
what does the solution to that
two-period problem look like?

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:11.810 align:middle line:90%
Is it full insurance?

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:14.830 align:middle line:90%
Is it borrowing and lending?

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:18.820 align:middle line:84%
And if it's not either, one
what is the logic of why

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:23.310 align:middle line:90%
we know it can't be either?

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:25.970 align:middle line:90%
So let me take--

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:29.180 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Let me
take a stab at this.

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:31.280 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, so I
remember that we said

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:34.070 align:middle line:84%
that the full insurance
wasn't optimal

00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:36.650 align:middle line:84%
because if you had
full insurance, then

00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:38.720 align:middle line:90%
it wouldn't be truth-telling.

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:40.790 align:middle line:84%
And so you would
never be able to reach

00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:43.960 align:middle line:90%
that optimal equilibrium there.

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:45.730 align:middle line:84%
For the borrowing and
lending, I remember

00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:47.770 align:middle line:84%
we had some kind
of argument where

00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:51.670 align:middle line:84%
we said that the incentive
constraints won't bind.

00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:54.610 align:middle line:84%
And so because
those didn't bind,

00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:57.068 align:middle line:84%
it's equivalent to just
not having the incentive

00:07:57.068 --> 00:07:57.860 align:middle line:90%
constraints at all.

00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:00.460 align:middle line:84%
Which means you might as well
just do full risk sharing.

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:03.160 align:middle line:84%
But we already showed
that we could do that.

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:06.160 align:middle line:84%
But I don't think I quite recall
why the incentive constraints

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:08.365 align:middle line:90%
don't bind in the first place.

00:08:08.365 --> 00:08:10.240 align:middle line:84%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Well,
it's a perfect answer.

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:10.900 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:15.820 align:middle line:84%
And to answer your question,
the presumption is somehow,

00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:18.130 align:middle line:84%
if your income is low,
you want to borrow.

00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:20.890 align:middle line:84%
And you strictly
prefer that to lending.

00:08:20.890 --> 00:08:25.120 align:middle line:84%
So that strict preference
is a strict inequality

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:29.660 align:middle line:84%
in the constraint and
hence, not binding.

00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:32.480 align:middle line:84%
And likewise, if
your income is high,

00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:38.625 align:middle line:84%
you strictly prefer to lend
rather than borrow, OK?

00:08:38.625 --> 00:08:39.750 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: That makes sense.

00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:40.520 align:middle line:90%
Thanks.

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:41.570 align:middle line:90%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yep.

00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:42.830 align:middle line:90%
Your answer was really good.

00:08:42.830 --> 00:08:44.070 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:49.730 align:middle line:84%
OK, so let's go to maybe
one more thing here.

00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:53.270 align:middle line:84%
I did feel that I
was rushing a bit

00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:55.470 align:middle line:90%
toward the end of the lecture.

00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:58.100 align:middle line:84%
So I'm happy to take
questions rather

00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:00.770 align:middle line:90%
than going through these.

00:09:00.770 --> 00:09:04.520 align:middle line:84%
Let's try a couple of them to
get the conversation going.

00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:08.150 align:middle line:84%
I drew a distinction
between encryption, hashing,

00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:10.970 align:middle line:90%
and cryptographic puzzles.

00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:12.783 align:middle line:90%
Does anyone remember?

00:09:12.783 --> 00:09:14.450 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I
think I know this one.

00:09:14.450 --> 00:09:18.540 align:middle line:84%
So encryption is where you have
some specific key secret key

00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:19.700 align:middle line:90%
shared between two parties.

00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:22.250 align:middle line:84%
And then you can use that
key to encrypt a message

00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:24.170 align:middle line:84%
and then decrypt it
at the other end.

00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:30.110 align:middle line:84%
Hashing is some function that
it changes pretty randomly,

00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:31.100 align:middle line:90%
depending on the input.

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:34.940 align:middle line:84%
So it's distorts things that
encapsulates the whole message.

00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:38.090 align:middle line:84%
And if you change
a message, it's

00:09:38.090 --> 00:09:40.658 align:middle line:84%
very hard to change a message
to keep the same hash.

00:09:40.658 --> 00:09:42.200 align:middle line:84%
A cryptographic
puzzle, I think, it's

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:44.150 align:middle line:90%
something that is hard to do.

00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:47.190 align:middle line:84%
And it's known to
be hard in some way.

00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:49.340 align:middle line:84%
And I think
homomorphic encryption,

00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:52.582 align:middle line:84%
I think that's the one where
you have basically what

00:09:52.582 --> 00:09:53.790 align:middle line:90%
amounts to a linear function.

00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:57.050 align:middle line:90%
So you just encrypt something.

00:09:57.050 --> 00:09:59.430 align:middle line:84%
Add together all the
encrypted things,

00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:01.280 align:middle line:84%
and then you can
decrypt the sum.

00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:06.050 align:middle line:84%
And then you can get the
correct decrypted sum

00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:08.420 align:middle line:84%
without having to know any
of the individual components,

00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:09.575 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:10:09.575 --> 00:10:10.700 align:middle line:90%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Very good.

00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:12.440 align:middle line:90%
Excellent.

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:16.160 align:middle line:90%
Just a couple words of comment.

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:20.420 align:middle line:84%
The encryption part, it's
private and public keys.

00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:22.340 align:middle line:84%
And the private keys
are never shared.

00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:25.263 align:middle line:84%
It's the public key that's
shared between the parties.

00:10:25.263 --> 00:10:28.610 align:middle line:90%


00:10:28.610 --> 00:10:31.260 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: I just described
symmetric encryption.

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:34.160 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it's also
private, public keys.

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:37.310 align:middle line:84%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: OK, you
have the background for this.

00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:40.250 align:middle line:90%
OK, excellent.

00:10:40.250 --> 00:10:41.900 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and hashing
is what you said.

00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:44.540 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of a one-way function.

00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:45.500 align:middle line:90%
You know what goes in.

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:48.230 align:middle line:84%
But you cannot
interpret what goes out.

00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:50.750 align:middle line:90%
And the puzzles are fine.

00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:53.000 align:middle line:84%
And homomorphic
encryption is fine.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.440 align:middle line:90%
So thank you, that's great.

00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:57.630 align:middle line:90%


00:10:57.630 --> 00:11:00.200 align:middle line:84%
Sounds like you might have known
the answers to these things

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:01.220 align:middle line:90%
before the class.

00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:05.930 align:middle line:84%
But I mean, from other
work that you're doing.

00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:08.690 align:middle line:90%
But that's fine.

00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:12.430 align:middle line:90%
Let's see, one last thing.

00:11:12.430 --> 00:11:14.080 align:middle line:90%
Consensus Protocol.

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:16.390 align:middle line:84%
Is a consensus
protocol necessarily

00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:18.490 align:middle line:90%
incentive compatible?

00:11:18.490 --> 00:11:21.100 align:middle line:84%
So this is like begging
for a discussion of how

00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:26.200 align:middle line:84%
computer science use the
word trust and economics use

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:28.370 align:middle line:90%
the word trust.

00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:32.490 align:middle line:84%
And again, I'm just
taking volunteers today.

00:11:32.490 --> 00:11:35.720 align:middle line:84%
So again, lots of
information on those

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:38.090 align:middle line:84%
slides just kind of
appeared on one slide

00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:40.100 align:middle line:90%
and I didn't belabor it.

00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:42.110 align:middle line:84%
The basic idea in
computer science

00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:45.230 align:middle line:84%
is that most nodes
are trustworthy.

00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:47.510 align:middle line:84%
They're going to
follow the protocol.

00:11:47.510 --> 00:11:53.180 align:middle line:84%
But a handful of nodes or
actors are either faulty,

00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:55.430 align:middle line:84%
in the sense of the
computer doesn't work well,

00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:58.520 align:middle line:84%
or nefarious in the sense
that they're determined

00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:00.450 align:middle line:90%
to undercut the system.

00:12:00.450 --> 00:12:04.670 align:middle line:84%
So the basic premise is, most
nodes are honest in the sense

00:12:04.670 --> 00:12:08.690 align:middle line:84%
that they're going to
follow the algorithm.

00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:10.910 align:middle line:84%
In economics, it's
a dismal science.

00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:12.800 align:middle line:90%
We don't trust anybody.

00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:18.050 align:middle line:84%
So everyone, on the other
hand, can be given incentives.

00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:23.780 align:middle line:84%
So we assume maximizing utility
or profit-maximizing behavior.

00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:25.670 align:middle line:84%
And then we load
things up in a way

00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:30.140 align:middle line:84%
that even though there are
secrets, like preference shocks

00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:33.530 align:middle line:84%
or unobserved states
and so on, the actors

00:12:33.530 --> 00:12:38.800 align:middle line:84%
have an incentive to reveal
what those states are.

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:42.460 align:middle line:84%
So the message is, as
in mechanism design

00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:45.520 align:middle line:84%
that we did earlier
in the lecture,

00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:48.070 align:middle line:90%
are part of the contract.

00:12:48.070 --> 00:12:51.370 align:middle line:84%
And they're going
to be sent honestly.

00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:54.790 align:middle line:84%
But it's due to the
incentive constraints.

00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:56.410 align:middle line:84%
And without the
incentive constraints,

00:12:56.410 --> 00:13:00.100 align:middle line:84%
we kind of assume
everyone's going to cheat.

00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:05.060 align:middle line:84%
So it is kind of a
philosophical difference.

00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:06.890 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, that's
why, in the lecture

00:13:06.890 --> 00:13:13.300 align:middle line:84%
I put the discussion of
bitcoin and other algorithms

00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:19.890 align:middle line:84%
in the context of mechanism
design to draw this contrast.

00:13:19.890 --> 00:13:23.390 align:middle line:90%
OK, so that's the review sheet.

00:13:23.390 --> 00:13:29.090 align:middle line:84%
And let's get to
don't lecture here.

00:13:29.090 --> 00:13:31.600 align:middle line:90%


00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:37.940 align:middle line:84%
OK, so today part two,
more on contracts.

00:13:37.940 --> 00:13:42.010 align:middle line:84%
So the application is going
to be financial markets.

00:13:42.010 --> 00:13:45.820 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to try to figure
out what kind of contracts

00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:48.850 align:middle line:84%
a small business would
write with a lender.

00:13:48.850 --> 00:13:53.020 align:middle line:84%
In particular, what the
underlying obstacles to trade

00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:53.590 align:middle line:90%
are.

00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:57.820 align:middle line:84%
We're going to want to identify,
from data using the theory,

00:13:57.820 --> 00:14:02.080 align:middle line:84%
what those obstacles are
that limit the ability to go

00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:03.910 align:middle line:84%
into business or
limit the ability

00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:08.350 align:middle line:84%
to finance the business once
you're already in business.

00:14:08.350 --> 00:14:10.870 align:middle line:84%
So that's the
economics part of it.

00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:13.360 align:middle line:84%
The technique part
of it is, we're

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:17.200 align:middle line:84%
going to do a structural
estimation of the model.

00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:22.210 align:middle line:84%
But we will also look at some
reduced form techniques that

00:14:22.210 --> 00:14:24.130 align:middle line:84%
are data summaries
that are consistent

00:14:24.130 --> 00:14:25.900 align:middle line:90%
with the structural model.

00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:28.090 align:middle line:84%
Essentially, we use
reduced-form techniques

00:14:28.090 --> 00:14:30.700 align:middle line:84%
to identify stylized
facts different

00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:31.970 align:middle line:90%
across different regions.

00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:34.180 align:middle line:84%
And then we use
the theory to try

00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:36.070 align:middle line:84%
to make sense of
what we're seeing.

00:14:36.070 --> 00:14:38.440 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of an
experimental laboratory.

00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:41.240 align:middle line:84%
And there are going to be
two sources of constraints.

00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:45.580 align:middle line:84%
So one is for short, a
collateral constraint.

00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:49.330 align:middle line:84%
Agents can borrow, but
potentially not much.

00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:52.630 align:middle line:84%
In order to borrow, they
have to post collateral

00:14:52.630 --> 00:14:54.640 align:middle line:84%
so that the amount
they can borrow

00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:58.120 align:middle line:90%
is limited by their wealth.

00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:02.800 align:middle line:84%
That means low-wealth households
may not borrow very much.

00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:06.790 align:middle line:84%
And it may not make sense
to go into a business at all

00:15:06.790 --> 00:15:10.180 align:middle line:84%
because they can only operate
at a very small scale.

00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:13.060 align:middle line:84%
Or if they do go into
business, because it's the best

00:15:13.060 --> 00:15:15.610 align:middle line:84%
alternative
notwithstanding, they

00:15:15.610 --> 00:15:18.820 align:middle line:84%
are not investing very much
because of that collateral

00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:19.930 align:middle line:90%
constraint.

00:15:19.930 --> 00:15:23.260 align:middle line:84%
Now when there's a collateral
constraint that's binding,

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:27.320 align:middle line:84%
the borrowing is a
proportion of wealth.

00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:30.380 align:middle line:84%
So if you're thinking about
going across different firms

00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:35.120 align:middle line:84%
in the cross section,
as net worth increases,

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:41.260 align:middle line:84%
borrowing would increase, again,
for constrained entrepreneurs.

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:43.030 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand, it
doesn't necessarily

00:15:43.030 --> 00:15:45.550 align:middle line:84%
mean that with this collateral
constraint everyone's

00:15:45.550 --> 00:15:46.930 align:middle line:90%
going to be borrowing.

00:15:46.930 --> 00:15:51.370 align:middle line:84%
They may have enough wealth
to entirely self-finance.

00:15:51.370 --> 00:15:56.800 align:middle line:84%
Or the borrowing constraint
isn't binding in the sense

00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:58.690 align:middle line:84%
that they don't go
up to the limit.

00:15:58.690 --> 00:15:59.650 align:middle line:90%
They have some wealth.

00:15:59.650 --> 00:16:01.720 align:middle line:84%
They borrow
additional resources.

00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:05.000 align:middle line:84%
But they could have borrowed
more and they don't do it.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.320 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand, a different
constraint is a moral hazard.

00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:12.970 align:middle line:84%
Now moral hazard means that,
it's a funny terminology.

00:16:12.970 --> 00:16:16.870 align:middle line:84%
It's like you buy an
insurance policy that's

00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:20.410 align:middle line:84%
supposed to pay off if
your house burns down.

00:16:20.410 --> 00:16:22.750 align:middle line:84%
But because you're
insured, then you

00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:27.190 align:middle line:84%
don't pay attention and take
the appropriate precautionary

00:16:27.190 --> 00:16:28.300 align:middle line:90%
measures.

00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:31.510 align:middle line:84%
So the house is
likely to burn down.

00:16:31.510 --> 00:16:33.440 align:middle line:84%
For some reason, in
the insurance industry,

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:36.160 align:middle line:84%
this is referred
to as moral hazard

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:38.230 align:middle line:90%
as if it were, quote, "immoral."

00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:41.300 align:middle line:84%
But again, from
our dismal science,

00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:42.670 align:middle line:90%
economics point of view.

00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:45.385 align:middle line:90%
It's not immoral, per se.

00:16:45.385 --> 00:16:48.550 align:middle line:84%
It's just that it didn't
have the right incentives.

00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:53.740 align:middle line:84%
And in this moral hazard world,
effort, diligence, taking care

00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:55.130 align:middle line:90%
is not observed.

00:16:55.130 --> 00:16:58.360 align:middle line:84%
So the only way the insurance
company or the lender

00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:03.100 align:middle line:84%
can get the money back is when
there's not an adverse event

00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:06.250 align:middle line:84%
or the firm is successful
in making profit.

00:17:06.250 --> 00:17:08.680 align:middle line:84%
Now that means that
poor borrowers who

00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:11.800 align:middle line:84%
owe a lot of money
don't have an incentive

00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:14.500 align:middle line:84%
to work very hard at being
diligent because they're going

00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:16.359 align:middle line:84%
to pay the bulk of
their returns back

00:17:16.359 --> 00:17:18.670 align:middle line:84%
if they're successful
to the bank

00:17:18.670 --> 00:17:21.140 align:middle line:90%
or to the insurance company.

00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:22.930 align:middle line:90%
So they don't take care.

00:17:22.930 --> 00:17:25.660 align:middle line:84%
And the probability
of failure is high.

00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:27.160 align:middle line:90%
It's a constraint.

00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:28.960 align:middle line:84%
Because the
probability of failure

00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:33.290 align:middle line:84%
could be high, especially
for low-wealth agents,

00:17:33.290 --> 00:17:35.780 align:middle line:84%
the banks, in order to
break even on those loans,

00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:37.970 align:middle line:84%
have to charge high
interest rates.

00:17:37.970 --> 00:17:40.415 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, the rate
could be so high,

00:17:40.415 --> 00:17:42.170 align:middle line:84%
it would be high
enough for the lender

00:17:42.170 --> 00:17:43.700 align:middle line:84%
to break even but
the borrower is

00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:49.730 align:middle line:84%
no longer interested because
it's just too high of a rate.

00:17:49.730 --> 00:17:52.700 align:middle line:84%
And likewise, high
rates, they may not

00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:56.280 align:middle line:84%
want to borrow very much, even
if they do go into business.

00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:58.820 align:middle line:84%
Another difference with
the collateral constraint

00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:02.840 align:middle line:84%
is in the moral hazard world,
the incentive constraint

00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:05.090 align:middle line:90%
is always binding.

00:18:05.090 --> 00:18:07.700 align:middle line:84%
That's a version of what
we were just discussing,

00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:11.270 align:middle line:84%
full insurance is never optimal
because under full insurance,

00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:13.740 align:middle line:90%
you exert minimal effort.

00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:16.130 align:middle line:84%
So you don't offer
full insurance.

00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:18.890 align:middle line:84%
But likewise, then
effort it is lower

00:18:18.890 --> 00:18:21.300 align:middle line:84%
than it would have been in
a full information world.

00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:25.970 align:middle line:84%
So the incentive constraint, to
be diligent, is always binding.

00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:30.230 align:middle line:84%
And the way out of that
problem, if in a cross section,

00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:33.110 align:middle line:84%
entrepreneurs have more and
more wealth comparing one

00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:36.080 align:middle line:84%
to the other, then they
can self-finance more.

00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:41.060 align:middle line:84%
And the more you self-finance,
the less you have to pay back.

00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:44.920 align:middle line:84%
So in this case, as wealth
goes up, borrowing goes down.

00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:46.930 align:middle line:84%
That's exactly the
opposite from what

00:18:46.930 --> 00:18:49.000 align:middle line:84%
we got in the limited
liability case

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:50.770 align:middle line:90%
for constrained entrepreneurs.

00:18:50.770 --> 00:18:52.790 align:middle line:84%
When wealth went up,
borrowing went up.

00:18:52.790 --> 00:18:56.260 align:middle line:84%
So I alluded to these
reduced-form statistics.

00:18:56.260 --> 00:19:00.040 align:middle line:84%
We will see again at some
point a summary of the data

00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:03.730 align:middle line:84%
that, depending on the
region that they're in,

00:19:03.730 --> 00:19:07.390 align:middle line:84%
we will see either this one
result in the cross section

00:19:07.390 --> 00:19:09.230 align:middle line:90%
or the other one.

00:19:09.230 --> 00:19:14.080 align:middle line:84%
And the goal then is to
take the full-blown model

00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:16.270 align:middle line:84%
and do structural
estimates to determine

00:19:16.270 --> 00:19:17.920 align:middle line:90%
which constrain is binding.

00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:18.850 align:middle line:90%
It could be one.

00:19:18.850 --> 00:19:19.780 align:middle line:90%
It could be the other.

00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:22.390 align:middle line:84%
Actually, technically,
it could be both.

00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:26.500 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to show you that
once we review the tools we

00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:29.740 align:middle line:84%
already have, pending on
the appropriate constraints,

00:19:29.740 --> 00:19:33.460 align:middle line:84%
it's actually easy to test
one versus the other versus

00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:34.600 align:middle line:90%
multiple.

00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:37.120 align:middle line:90%
It's relatively easy to do.

00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:40.390 align:middle line:84%
But we are learning some
of those new tools today.

00:19:40.390 --> 00:19:43.340 align:middle line:84%
That's half of the
point of the lecture.

00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:48.100 align:middle line:84%
So I've made reference twice
to differences across regions.

00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:51.040 align:middle line:84%
I think I may have shown
you this picture before.

00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:52.240 align:middle line:90%
But I'm not sure.

00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:54.910 align:middle line:84%
We certainly looked
at the Thai data.

00:19:54.910 --> 00:19:59.050 align:middle line:84%
We looked at the monthly data
when we did risk and return

00:19:59.050 --> 00:20:02.140 align:middle line:84%
in village Thailand, which
was the second application

00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:04.480 align:middle line:90%
of the risk-sharing sections.

00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:07.240 align:middle line:90%
So anyway, Bangkok's over here.

00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:09.430 align:middle line:90%
This is central region.

00:20:09.430 --> 00:20:13.390 align:middle line:84%
These yellow provinces were
ones that I had surveyed

00:20:13.390 --> 00:20:16.870 align:middle line:90%
in annual data since 1997.

00:20:16.870 --> 00:20:20.980 align:middle line:84%
And over here in the East, but
they call it the Northeast,

00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:23.260 align:middle line:90%
we have two other provinces.

00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:26.410 align:middle line:84%
These are predominantly
rural, agricultural.

00:20:26.410 --> 00:20:30.520 align:middle line:84%
The ones near Bangkok are
much more industrialized.

00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:34.330 align:middle line:84%
And here's a map of
Sisaket, just to show you

00:20:34.330 --> 00:20:36.490 align:middle line:90%
where the data are coming from.

00:20:36.490 --> 00:20:38.620 align:middle line:84%
We've got a lot
of little villages

00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:43.180 align:middle line:84%
here, these little dots, as well
as parts of the road network.

00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:46.540 align:middle line:84%
And then the colored
circles correspond to,

00:20:46.540 --> 00:20:49.570 align:middle line:84%
if they're purple,
these clusters

00:20:49.570 --> 00:20:52.240 align:middle line:84%
are where we gather the
annual data that we're

00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:54.160 align:middle line:90%
going to be using today.

00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:57.880 align:middle line:84%
In the previous lectures, Risk
and Return in Village Thailand,

00:20:57.880 --> 00:21:00.670 align:middle line:90%
we were using the monthly data.

00:21:00.670 --> 00:21:02.110 align:middle line:90%
And those are stars.

00:21:02.110 --> 00:21:05.230 align:middle line:84%
And if you look
really closely, you'll

00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:08.590 align:middle line:84%
eventually find a cluster
with the stars that

00:21:08.590 --> 00:21:10.420 align:middle line:90%
correspond to the monthly data.

00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:14.420 align:middle line:84%
The annual data are
spread out much more.

00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:15.580 align:middle line:90%
Those stars are up here.

00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:17.560 align:middle line:90%
They're just not visible.

00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:20.170 align:middle line:84%
I know these provinces
like the back of my hand

00:21:20.170 --> 00:21:22.090 align:middle line:84%
because I've been
there so often.

00:21:22.090 --> 00:21:27.850 align:middle line:84%
OK, so again, Thai
data, 1997 onwards,

00:21:27.850 --> 00:21:30.190 align:middle line:90%
almost 3,000 households.

00:21:30.190 --> 00:21:32.260 align:middle line:84%
They're running
their businesses.

00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:35.800 align:middle line:84%
As you know, livestock,
fish, shrimp, farm,

00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:38.470 align:middle line:90%
and small business like vendors.

00:21:38.470 --> 00:21:40.870 align:middle line:84%
And we have those two
regions of the country.

00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:43.900 align:middle line:84%
The cool thing is
that in 1997, we

00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:46.240 align:middle line:84%
had the foresight
to ask about some

00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:49.790 align:middle line:84%
of the things that had happened
in the last five years.

00:21:49.790 --> 00:21:53.200 align:middle line:84%
So we have their
wealth retrospectively,

00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:56.260 align:middle line:84%
what it was five
years ago before 1997,

00:21:56.260 --> 00:22:00.970 align:middle line:84%
and also what kind of occupation
they were engaged in five years

00:22:00.970 --> 00:22:02.440 align:middle line:90%
before 1997.

00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:06.580 align:middle line:84%
So that those are two of
the key variables, namely,

00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:09.640 align:middle line:84%
how much wealth did
you have in 1992?

00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:13.330 align:middle line:84%
And what business
were you in 1992?

00:22:13.330 --> 00:22:16.330 align:middle line:84%
And then, did you change
your occupation, say,

00:22:16.330 --> 00:22:19.960 align:middle line:84%
going from being a wage
earner to going into business

00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:22.090 align:middle line:90%
over those five year periods?

00:22:22.090 --> 00:22:24.940 align:middle line:84%
And again, we're going to
find the bottom line is

00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:28.990 align:middle line:84%
the data on wealth and
occupation transitions

00:22:28.990 --> 00:22:31.510 align:middle line:84%
as well as the
cross-sectional data is going

00:22:31.510 --> 00:22:35.590 align:middle line:84%
to favor moral hazard as being
the constraint in the wealthier

00:22:35.590 --> 00:22:36.760 align:middle line:90%
central region.

00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:40.600 align:middle line:84%
And in the Northeast, it's going
to be that limited liability,

00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:43.420 align:middle line:84%
although frequently,
both limited liability

00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:46.270 align:middle line:90%
and moral hazard in combination.

00:22:46.270 --> 00:22:48.340 align:middle line:84%
So hopefully, you're
wondering how on Earth we

00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:50.740 align:middle line:90%
could ever figure this all out.

00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:54.670 align:middle line:84%
Here, by the way, is the
picture of increasing wealth

00:22:54.670 --> 00:22:58.060 align:middle line:84%
and increasing
probability of making

00:22:58.060 --> 00:22:59.590 align:middle line:90%
a transition into business.

00:22:59.590 --> 00:23:04.270 align:middle line:84%
So this line here is upward
sloping, the higher the wealth,

00:23:04.270 --> 00:23:06.260 align:middle line:90%
the higher the transition.

00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:10.180 align:middle line:84%
But this could, in theory,
be a very steep profile

00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:12.040 align:middle line:90%
or a very flat one.

00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:16.360 align:middle line:84%
So part of it is estimating the
profile suggested by the theory

00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:19.120 align:middle line:84%
and then comparing it
to the actual data.

00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:20.320 align:middle line:90%
Here's the model.

00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:24.850 align:middle line:84%
So agents, all these ingredients
should be very familiar by now.

00:23:24.850 --> 00:23:28.180 align:middle line:84%
You've seen them at least
twice and maybe more.

00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:32.650 align:middle line:84%
Households that could run a firm
or could just be a wage earner

00:23:32.650 --> 00:23:35.840 align:middle line:84%
cares about the utility
of consumption and effort.

00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:39.310 align:middle line:84%
So the consumption part
is constant relative risk

00:23:39.310 --> 00:23:40.580 align:middle line:90%
aversion.

00:23:40.580 --> 00:23:44.750 align:middle line:84%
And the degree of risk aversion
is gamma when gamma is zero.

00:23:44.750 --> 00:23:45.860 align:middle line:90%
This thing is linear.

00:23:45.860 --> 00:23:48.710 align:middle line:84%
That's risk neutral so
not risk averse at all.

00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:50.960 align:middle line:84%
As gamma gets higher
and higher, you

00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:53.250 align:middle line:90%
have more and more curvature.

00:23:53.250 --> 00:23:56.990 align:middle line:84%
And then entering
inseparably, linearly

00:23:56.990 --> 00:24:01.670 align:middle line:84%
is this utility of effort,
Z being effort, taking care,

00:24:01.670 --> 00:24:04.370 align:middle line:84%
due diligence, how
hard you're working,

00:24:04.370 --> 00:24:08.420 align:middle line:84%
again, raised to a power like
constant relative risk aversion

00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:10.070 align:middle line:90%
to a different degree.

00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:13.250 align:middle line:84%
Gamma 2, rather than
gamma 1 and kappa,

00:24:13.250 --> 00:24:17.870 align:middle line:84%
reflects the utility trade-off
between consumption and effort.

00:24:17.870 --> 00:24:20.580 align:middle line:84%
So not to say you
need to memorize this.

00:24:20.580 --> 00:24:22.940 align:middle line:84%
But we can pay attention
to the parameters.

00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:27.020 align:middle line:84%
We got three of them here,
gamma 1, gamma 2, and kappa.

00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:29.360 align:middle line:84%
So we would like
to estimate those.

00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:32.660 align:middle line:84%
And we will start
looking at the model

00:24:32.660 --> 00:24:35.750 align:middle line:84%
when gamma 1 is zero,
hence, risk neutral,

00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:38.810 align:middle line:84%
and then let them be
risk averse and estimate

00:24:38.810 --> 00:24:40.280 align:middle line:90%
the model generally.

00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:44.000 align:middle line:84%
The estimation will
use linear programming.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.790 align:middle line:84%
You've seen this trade-off
between consumption and effort.

00:24:46.790 --> 00:24:50.690 align:middle line:84%
When we did the lecture on
utility and preferences,

00:24:50.690 --> 00:24:52.730 align:middle line:84%
there was a slide
at the very end

00:24:52.730 --> 00:24:56.270 align:middle line:84%
that had the agent choosing
between work and wheat

00:24:56.270 --> 00:24:57.530 align:middle line:90%
as an output.

00:24:57.530 --> 00:25:00.770 align:middle line:84%
And we actually did that
in the right-hand side

00:25:00.770 --> 00:25:02.900 align:middle line:84%
with respect to
consumption and leisure

00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:04.520 align:middle line:84%
or the left-hand
side with respect

00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:06.050 align:middle line:90%
to consumption and effort.

00:25:06.050 --> 00:25:11.240 align:middle line:84%
So this is a parametric version
of those same preferences.

00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:15.080 align:middle line:84%
More on the model, households
differ with respect

00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:16.550 align:middle line:90%
to initial wealth.

00:25:16.550 --> 00:25:19.430 align:middle line:84%
As I said, call
that A for assets.

00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:22.220 align:middle line:84%
They differ with respect
to talent, theta.

00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:24.950 align:middle line:84%
Some people are better
things than other people

00:25:24.950 --> 00:25:26.780 align:middle line:90%
like running a business.

00:25:26.780 --> 00:25:31.010 align:middle line:84%
And S as is the level of
schooling, formal education.

00:25:31.010 --> 00:25:36.410 align:middle line:84%
All are observed by the
agents and even by the banks.

00:25:36.410 --> 00:25:38.360 align:middle line:90%
That's a bit of a stretch.

00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:41.060 align:middle line:84%
But we are imagining
the bank can see wealth

00:25:41.060 --> 00:25:43.670 align:middle line:90%
and talent and education.

00:25:43.670 --> 00:25:47.660 align:middle line:84%
We however, only see what
we have in the data, which

00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:49.640 align:middle line:90%
is wealth and schooling.

00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:53.060 align:middle line:84%
We do not see
talent as modelers.

00:25:53.060 --> 00:25:56.690 align:middle line:84%
But we can make some
assumption about it, namely,

00:25:56.690 --> 00:25:57.980 align:middle line:90%
it's log linear.

00:25:57.980 --> 00:26:03.360 align:middle line:84%
Talent log theta is log linear
in assets and schooling.

00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:06.530 align:middle line:84%
And we assume that
error term is normally

00:26:06.530 --> 00:26:10.520 align:middle line:84%
distributed with a mean
0 and variance of 1.

00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:12.210 align:middle line:90%
Why are we doing this?

00:26:12.210 --> 00:26:14.180 align:middle line:84%
Well, we want to
distinguish the constraint.

00:26:14.180 --> 00:26:17.570 align:middle line:84%
But the worry is that
talented people in the past

00:26:17.570 --> 00:26:19.910 align:middle line:84%
have been more successful
and hence, already

00:26:19.910 --> 00:26:21.470 align:middle line:90%
have higher assets.

00:26:21.470 --> 00:26:25.160 align:middle line:84%
We want to be able to
distinguish the set part, which

00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:29.480 align:middle line:84%
is wealth, which plays a role
in the financing constraints,

00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:32.750 align:middle line:84%
versus talent, which is
productivity, which is entry

00:26:32.750 --> 00:26:34.640 align:middle line:90%
in the production function.

00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:37.790 align:middle line:84%
If we didn't allow talent
to depend on wealth,

00:26:37.790 --> 00:26:42.080 align:middle line:84%
then we could incorrectly infer
that financing constraints are

00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:44.750 align:middle line:84%
playing a role because
higher wealth allows

00:26:44.750 --> 00:26:45.890 align:middle line:90%
people to do better.

00:26:45.890 --> 00:26:47.870 align:middle line:84%
But actually, it could
be playing a role

00:26:47.870 --> 00:26:49.670 align:middle line:84%
through this third
variable, namely

00:26:49.670 --> 00:26:52.190 align:middle line:84%
talent, that higher wealth
means higher talent,

00:26:52.190 --> 00:26:53.540 align:middle line:90%
reflects higher talent.

00:26:53.540 --> 00:26:55.550 align:middle line:84%
And it's actually
higher talent that

00:26:55.550 --> 00:26:58.610 align:middle line:84%
is the reason some people
are in business and operating

00:26:58.610 --> 00:26:59.930 align:middle line:90%
at a higher scale.

00:26:59.930 --> 00:27:02.630 align:middle line:84%
So this is kind
of a shorthand way

00:27:02.630 --> 00:27:08.390 align:middle line:84%
to allow things to be correlated
and not incorrectly infer

00:27:08.390 --> 00:27:10.520 align:middle line:90%
something about causality.

00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:15.700 align:middle line:84%
Other parts of the model,
q is output, profits.

00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:19.690 align:middle line:84%
It's a function of effort
and capital if you're a firm.

00:27:19.690 --> 00:27:23.500 align:middle line:84%
Or wage-earners, if
you're not a firm,

00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:28.030 align:middle line:84%
this output can take on
two values for simplicity,

00:27:28.030 --> 00:27:30.710 align:middle line:90%
namely success and failure.

00:27:30.710 --> 00:27:34.525 align:middle line:84%
So when they're successful in
the project, the value of q

00:27:34.525 --> 00:27:35.300 align:middle line:90%
is theta.

00:27:35.300 --> 00:27:40.030 align:middle line:84%
So more talented entrepreneurs
have higher output conditioned

00:27:40.030 --> 00:27:41.770 align:middle line:90%
on being successful.

00:27:41.770 --> 00:27:44.860 align:middle line:84%
And the other simplification
is the failure, which

00:27:44.860 --> 00:27:46.790 align:middle line:90%
means they have zero output.

00:27:46.790 --> 00:27:50.290 align:middle line:84%
And if you have zero
output, then you're

00:27:50.290 --> 00:27:51.550 align:middle line:90%
not going to repay a loan.

00:27:51.550 --> 00:27:54.800 align:middle line:84%
And there's no output with
which to repay the loan.

00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:59.410 align:middle line:84%
So this whole branch of q
equals 0 becomes simplistic.

00:27:59.410 --> 00:28:03.490 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, yeah, two extremes
here, three really.

00:28:03.490 --> 00:28:06.190 align:middle line:84%
Talent only enters
through success.

00:28:06.190 --> 00:28:09.340 align:middle line:84%
There's only two values
of profitability, success

00:28:09.340 --> 00:28:10.660 align:middle line:90%
or failure.

00:28:10.660 --> 00:28:14.120 align:middle line:84%
And failure corresponds
with zero output.

00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:17.740 align:middle line:84%
So let's look then at the
probability of success.

00:28:17.740 --> 00:28:21.370 align:middle line:84%
The probability of q is
equal to theta, the high one,

00:28:21.370 --> 00:28:24.490 align:middle line:84%
conditioned on effort and
the level of capitalization

00:28:24.490 --> 00:28:25.520 align:middle line:90%
of the firm.

00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:29.680 align:middle line:84%
And that's essentially in the
numerator like a Cobb-Douglass

00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:31.150 align:middle line:90%
function.

00:28:31.150 --> 00:28:32.230 align:middle line:90%
K is capital.

00:28:32.230 --> 00:28:36.040 align:middle line:84%
z is effort to the power
is alpha and 1 minus alpha,

00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:37.940 align:middle line:90%
a function you've seen before.

00:28:37.940 --> 00:28:40.240 align:middle line:84%
Now why is it being
divided by something?

00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:44.830 align:middle line:84%
Well, this whole thing is
supposed to be a probability.

00:28:44.830 --> 00:28:50.050 align:middle line:84%
Probability of success is
a number between 0 and 1.

00:28:50.050 --> 00:28:55.180 align:middle line:84%
So if k and z were 0,
the numerator is 0.

00:28:55.180 --> 00:28:58.150 align:middle line:90%
0 divided by 1 is 0.

00:28:58.150 --> 00:29:00.700 align:middle line:90%
So that's the left endpoint.

00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:05.410 align:middle line:84%
And likewise, if k and z are
getting really, really big

00:29:05.410 --> 00:29:08.060 align:middle line:84%
and there's no natural
bound here yet,

00:29:08.060 --> 00:29:10.750 align:middle line:84%
then this numerator
is getting really big.

00:29:10.750 --> 00:29:14.120 align:middle line:84%
But so is the same term
in the denominator.

00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:17.470 align:middle line:84%
So this whole term is going
to 1 because the numerator

00:29:17.470 --> 00:29:20.420 align:middle line:84%
and denominator are
getting very, very similar.

00:29:20.420 --> 00:29:25.510 align:middle line:84%
So this P function is a
probability between 0 and 1,

00:29:25.510 --> 00:29:30.490 align:middle line:84%
no matter what k and z
are put into the firm.

00:29:30.490 --> 00:29:32.830 align:middle line:84%
Output is always
going to be observed

00:29:32.830 --> 00:29:35.050 align:middle line:90%
in the models that follow.

00:29:35.050 --> 00:29:39.130 align:middle line:84%
The issue is going to be whether
this effort z is observed

00:29:39.130 --> 00:29:43.660 align:middle line:84%
or not and whether k is
restricted by the collateral

00:29:43.660 --> 00:29:44.300 align:middle line:90%
constraint.

00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:46.250 align:middle line:84%
And I will show you
that in a minute.

00:29:46.250 --> 00:29:48.730 align:middle line:84%
And finally, the other branch,
not to lose sight of it,

00:29:48.730 --> 00:29:50.680 align:middle line:84%
they could choose
not to be a firm,

00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:52.900 align:middle line:90%
in which case k is equal to 0.

00:29:52.900 --> 00:29:57.460 align:middle line:84%
And when k is equal to 0,
the firm is not capitalized.

00:29:57.460 --> 00:30:00.520 align:middle line:84%
And effectively, the
household is a wage earner.

00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:04.120 align:middle line:84%
So earnings in the
wage sector are also

00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:06.730 align:middle line:90%
stochastic and probabilistic.

00:30:06.730 --> 00:30:10.150 align:middle line:90%
You can work hard to find a job.

00:30:10.150 --> 00:30:12.760 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't mean
you will find one.

00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:16.700 align:middle line:84%
The higher effort you
devote toward finding a job,

00:30:16.700 --> 00:30:19.210 align:middle line:84%
the higher would
be the probability

00:30:19.210 --> 00:30:21.850 align:middle line:90%
of getting the wage.

00:30:21.850 --> 00:30:25.300 align:middle line:84%
And again, this is
bounded between 0 and 1.

00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:28.270 align:middle line:84%
Now if you are a firm,
you may or may not borrow.

00:30:28.270 --> 00:30:30.850 align:middle line:84%
But if you borrow, there's
going to be an interest rate

00:30:30.850 --> 00:30:33.700 align:middle line:84%
schedule that determines
how much you pay back.

00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:36.520 align:middle line:84%
And that interest rate
schedule is a function of two

00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:39.250 align:middle line:84%
of the things the
lending firm observes,

00:30:39.250 --> 00:30:42.640 align:middle line:84%
the wealth of the household
and the household's talent.

00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:44.920 align:middle line:84%
And this schedule
is going to be such

00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:47.890 align:middle line:84%
that the banks, although
maximizing profits,

00:30:47.890 --> 00:30:49.990 align:middle line:90%
can at best break even.

00:30:49.990 --> 00:30:52.220 align:middle line:84%
And I'll show you that
constraint in a minute.

00:30:52.220 --> 00:30:55.660 align:middle line:84%
But I already alluded to it in
the sense of moral hazard being

00:30:55.660 --> 00:30:57.820 align:middle line:84%
a problem because
repayment going down

00:30:57.820 --> 00:31:00.790 align:middle line:84%
and banks having to raise
interest rates to cover

00:31:00.790 --> 00:31:02.830 align:middle line:90%
what otherwise would be losses.

00:31:02.830 --> 00:31:06.130 align:middle line:84%
They have to get enough
from the successful firms

00:31:06.130 --> 00:31:09.010 align:middle line:84%
to cover the fact that the
unsuccessful ones are not

00:31:09.010 --> 00:31:10.600 align:middle line:90%
paying off the loans.

00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:15.130 align:middle line:84%
When you're a worker
or a firm that is not

00:31:15.130 --> 00:31:16.990 align:middle line:84%
using all their
resources to borrow,

00:31:16.990 --> 00:31:19.510 align:middle line:84%
you have some
residual assets left.

00:31:19.510 --> 00:31:20.720 align:middle line:90%
They put it in the bank.

00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:23.140 align:middle line:84%
And they earn the
riskless rate of return.

00:31:23.140 --> 00:31:26.350 align:middle line:84%
So in some respects, there's
both borrowing and saving

00:31:26.350 --> 00:31:30.280 align:middle line:84%
going on here, depending on
what occupation you choose

00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:32.780 align:middle line:84%
and your underlying
characteristics.

00:31:32.780 --> 00:31:35.660 align:middle line:84%
So how are we going
to solve this problem?

00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:39.130 align:middle line:84%
We're going to solve for
a constrained optimum.

00:31:39.130 --> 00:31:41.530 align:middle line:84%
We are going to write
down a quote, unquote

00:31:41.530 --> 00:31:45.220 align:middle line:84%
"planner's problem," which I
sometimes refer to the math

00:31:45.220 --> 00:31:49.930 align:middle line:84%
problem, which is maximizing
lambda weighted sums

00:31:49.930 --> 00:31:54.370 align:middle line:84%
of utilities subject to
resource, truth-telling,

00:31:54.370 --> 00:31:56.620 align:middle line:90%
and liability constraints.

00:31:56.620 --> 00:32:01.240 align:middle line:84%
Now to restate that,
we're going to maximize

00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:05.320 align:middle line:84%
the utility, a weighted sum
of the utility of borrowers

00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:08.060 align:middle line:90%
and the utility of the banks.

00:32:08.060 --> 00:32:10.790 align:middle line:84%
The banks, however,
could make profits.

00:32:10.790 --> 00:32:13.230 align:middle line:84%
So we're just distinguishing,
in their case,

00:32:13.230 --> 00:32:16.530 align:middle line:90%
profits as a version of utility.

00:32:16.530 --> 00:32:19.800 align:middle line:84%
The second thing is, and I
didn't reload this picture,

00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:21.300 align:middle line:84%
if you go back to
the lecture where

00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:24.660 align:middle line:84%
we introduced the notion
of Pareto optimality.

00:32:24.660 --> 00:32:27.480 align:middle line:84%
We had the so-called
Pareto frontier.

00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:29.910 align:middle line:84%
And we decided the
points on the frontier

00:32:29.910 --> 00:32:31.930 align:middle line:90%
would be Pareto optimal.

00:32:31.930 --> 00:32:33.540 align:middle line:84%
And you could
achieve those points

00:32:33.540 --> 00:32:36.690 align:middle line:84%
by maximizing a particular
lambda-weighted sum

00:32:36.690 --> 00:32:40.380 align:middle line:84%
of utilities, or in this case,
a particular lambda-weighted sum

00:32:40.380 --> 00:32:42.870 align:middle line:84%
of profits and utility
of the borrower.

00:32:42.870 --> 00:32:44.770 align:middle line:84%
But there is another
way to do it,

00:32:44.770 --> 00:32:47.580 align:middle line:84%
which is to maximize the
utility of the borrower,

00:32:47.580 --> 00:32:51.750 align:middle line:84%
subject to a fixed
profit level of the bank.

00:32:51.750 --> 00:32:56.760 align:middle line:84%
Its equivalent, normally,
with these concave frontiers.

00:32:56.760 --> 00:32:59.520 align:middle line:84%
Then the next step is, OK,
there are many, many banks.

00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:01.020 align:middle line:90%
And they're competing.

00:33:01.020 --> 00:33:04.890 align:middle line:84%
If one representative bank were
to make a profit with respect

00:33:04.890 --> 00:33:07.620 align:middle line:84%
to the borrowing
customers, another bank

00:33:07.620 --> 00:33:10.260 align:middle line:84%
could step in and
undercut the first one

00:33:10.260 --> 00:33:12.250 align:middle line:90%
and do slightly better.

00:33:12.250 --> 00:33:14.640 align:middle line:84%
So this competitive
process is going

00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:18.720 align:middle line:84%
to drive the profits
of the bank down to 0.

00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:22.020 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to be looking
at particular Pareto optimum

00:33:22.020 --> 00:33:24.030 align:middle line:84%
where the utilities
of the borrowers

00:33:24.030 --> 00:33:27.420 align:middle line:84%
are maximized, subject to
a zero profit constraint

00:33:27.420 --> 00:33:28.860 align:middle line:90%
on the part of the lenders.

00:33:28.860 --> 00:33:32.460 align:middle line:84%
There are other optima we're
not going to look at today.

00:33:32.460 --> 00:33:35.250 align:middle line:84%
Although, it's going to be
clear from the equations how we

00:33:35.250 --> 00:33:38.490 align:middle line:84%
could have done
it more generally.

00:33:38.490 --> 00:33:41.970 align:middle line:84%
So this is the utility
of the borrower.

00:33:41.970 --> 00:33:45.820 align:middle line:84%
There are three
possible branches.

00:33:45.820 --> 00:33:47.970 align:middle line:84%
This is, again, the
risk-neutral borrower.

00:33:47.970 --> 00:33:53.350 align:middle line:84%
To get warmed up, if k
is 0, which is a choice.

00:33:53.350 --> 00:33:56.340 align:middle line:84%
But if the solution
is k equal to 0,

00:33:56.340 --> 00:33:59.850 align:middle line:84%
then, in fact, the household
is a wage-earner, not

00:33:59.850 --> 00:34:02.850 align:middle line:84%
a firm, deciding
on effort, which

00:34:02.850 --> 00:34:05.670 align:middle line:84%
determines the probability
of getting the wage,

00:34:05.670 --> 00:34:08.760 align:middle line:84%
although it comes at a
disutility cost of working.

00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:10.770 align:middle line:84%
And they put all their
wealth in the bank.

00:34:10.770 --> 00:34:14.040 align:middle line:84%
So that risk free rate
of interest times assets

00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:16.620 align:middle line:84%
is something they get at
the end of the period,

00:34:16.620 --> 00:34:18.270 align:middle line:90%
the savings account.

00:34:18.270 --> 00:34:21.719 align:middle line:84%
The second branch is
they do go into business

00:34:21.719 --> 00:34:24.210 align:middle line:84%
and there's capitalization
is positive,

00:34:24.210 --> 00:34:29.880 align:middle line:84%
but it's less than their
assets, so they can basically

00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:34.139 align:middle line:84%
take what's left, assets
minus capitalization,

00:34:34.139 --> 00:34:35.400 align:middle line:90%
and put it in the bank.

00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:38.489 align:middle line:84%
So these guys also get
a return on savings.

00:34:38.489 --> 00:34:41.580 align:middle line:84%
But part of their
wealth, the k part,

00:34:41.580 --> 00:34:43.989 align:middle line:84%
is stuck into the
production function.

00:34:43.989 --> 00:34:48.389 align:middle line:84%
So the return on that comes
from the possibility of profits.

00:34:48.389 --> 00:34:49.889 align:middle line:84%
And you still have
this trade-off

00:34:49.889 --> 00:34:53.980 align:middle line:84%
of probability of success
versus the disutility of effort.

00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:55.949 align:middle line:84%
And then the final
branch here is,

00:34:55.949 --> 00:34:59.850 align:middle line:84%
these guys have a k, which
is relatively large relative

00:34:59.850 --> 00:35:00.820 align:middle line:90%
to their assets.

00:35:00.820 --> 00:35:02.460 align:middle line:90%
So they got to borrow.

00:35:02.460 --> 00:35:05.820 align:middle line:84%
And this sign here
is a bit confusing.

00:35:05.820 --> 00:35:10.110 align:middle line:84%
But if k is greater than
a then a is less than k.

00:35:10.110 --> 00:35:11.670 align:middle line:90%
So this term is negative.

00:35:11.670 --> 00:35:15.090 align:middle line:84%
So naturally, they're
quote, "negative"

00:35:15.090 --> 00:35:18.180 align:middle line:84%
paying off the principal and
the interest on the loan.

00:35:18.180 --> 00:35:21.100 align:middle line:84%
And they only pay it off
if they're successful.

00:35:21.100 --> 00:35:24.180 align:middle line:84%
So again, this modified
Cobb-Douglas probability

00:35:24.180 --> 00:35:27.240 align:middle line:84%
expression is entering
in there as it does

00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:30.070 align:middle line:90%
for the probability of success.

00:35:30.070 --> 00:35:32.590 align:middle line:90%
So those are the three branches.

00:35:32.590 --> 00:35:34.590 align:middle line:84%
This is the
break-even constraint

00:35:34.590 --> 00:35:37.830 align:middle line:84%
of the bank, which as I've
said in words a couple of times

00:35:37.830 --> 00:35:40.270 align:middle line:84%
already, this is
the risk-free rate.

00:35:40.270 --> 00:35:43.500 align:middle line:84%
So a bank has basically got
to get funds from somewhere,

00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:45.760 align:middle line:90%
from depositors, actually.

00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:48.030 align:middle line:84%
And they've got to
break even because

00:35:48.030 --> 00:35:49.410 align:middle line:90%
of all that competition.

00:35:49.410 --> 00:35:53.400 align:middle line:84%
So they may get a higher return,
depending on the borrower's

00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:54.960 align:middle line:90%
wealth and talent.

00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:58.480 align:middle line:84%
But they only get that back when
that borrower is successful.

00:35:58.480 --> 00:36:01.470 align:middle line:84%
So this is the expected
return given the interest rate

00:36:01.470 --> 00:36:02.190 align:middle line:90%
schedule.

00:36:02.190 --> 00:36:06.100 align:middle line:84%
And that is driven down
to the risk-free rate.

00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:09.060 align:middle line:84%
So we have this 0
profit constraint

00:36:09.060 --> 00:36:12.070 align:middle line:84%
to impose as part
of the solution.

00:36:12.070 --> 00:36:14.340 align:middle line:84%
So again, to repeat
myself, instead

00:36:14.340 --> 00:36:17.100 align:middle line:84%
of maximizing a lambda-weighted
sum of utilities,

00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:19.620 align:middle line:84%
we're going to maximize
the utility of the borrower

00:36:19.620 --> 00:36:23.730 align:middle line:84%
subject to a particular
lambda for the bank,

00:36:23.730 --> 00:36:27.060 align:middle line:84%
a lambda, which is associated
with making zero profits.

00:36:27.060 --> 00:36:29.610 align:middle line:84%
And we just impose the
zero-profit constraint

00:36:29.610 --> 00:36:30.810 align:middle line:90%
from the get go.

00:36:30.810 --> 00:36:33.300 align:middle line:84%
It's also kind of
interesting in terms

00:36:33.300 --> 00:36:36.000 align:middle line:84%
of where we are in the
class because when we first

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.760 align:middle line:84%
introduced utility
maximization, we

00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:42.750 align:middle line:84%
had these partial equilibrium
exercises in which prices

00:36:42.750 --> 00:36:46.110 align:middle line:84%
and so on were taken as given,
although we varied them to see

00:36:46.110 --> 00:36:47.670 align:middle line:90%
what the household will do.

00:36:47.670 --> 00:36:52.140 align:middle line:84%
Likewise, when we did the
firm, we had input prices as

00:36:52.140 --> 00:36:53.200 align:middle line:90%
taken as given.

00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:55.090 align:middle line:90%
And we did some experiments.

00:36:55.090 --> 00:36:58.020 align:middle line:84%
And here, likewise,
we're in quote, unquote

00:36:58.020 --> 00:37:00.060 align:middle line:84%
"partial equilibrium"
in the sense

00:37:00.060 --> 00:37:04.865 align:middle line:84%
that wage and the interest
rate are given to us.

00:37:04.865 --> 00:37:06.240 align:middle line:84%
We're not trying
to explain them.

00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:07.870 align:middle line:84%
They're going to be
part of the data.

00:37:07.870 --> 00:37:11.110 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand, we're
definitely doing a contracting

00:37:11.110 --> 00:37:12.640 align:middle line:90%
a problem here.

00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:16.090 align:middle line:84%
And to do it, we have to draw
on those tools about Pareto

00:37:16.090 --> 00:37:19.180 align:middle line:84%
optimality and so on
and how to determine

00:37:19.180 --> 00:37:22.400 align:middle line:84%
Pareto optimal outcomes
via programming problems.

00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:26.860 align:middle line:84%
So we kind of are drawing on to
different segments of the class

00:37:26.860 --> 00:37:29.870 align:middle line:84%
that we've covered already
in this application.

00:37:29.870 --> 00:37:32.390 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
limited liability.

00:37:32.390 --> 00:37:35.890 align:middle line:84%
So limited liability,
let's just jump down here.

00:37:35.890 --> 00:37:37.060 align:middle line:90%
It's easier here.

00:37:37.060 --> 00:37:40.870 align:middle line:84%
k, that they can use the
capitalization of the firm,

00:37:40.870 --> 00:37:44.740 align:middle line:84%
is bounded above
by their assets.

00:37:44.740 --> 00:37:48.760 align:middle line:84%
Actually, it's lambda, some
proportionality times assets.

00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:51.490 align:middle line:84%
So this is referred to as
a borrowing constraint.

00:37:51.490 --> 00:37:54.010 align:middle line:84%
Now lambda could
be greater than 1.

00:37:54.010 --> 00:37:56.900 align:middle line:84%
They may be able to borrow
more than their wealth.

00:37:56.900 --> 00:37:58.380 align:middle line:90%
But it is limited.

00:37:58.380 --> 00:38:00.130 align:middle line:84%
There's a little bit
of a derivation here.

00:38:00.130 --> 00:38:01.672 align:middle line:84%
I was thinking about
it this morning.

00:38:01.672 --> 00:38:04.330 align:middle line:84%
It's not really all
that compelling.

00:38:04.330 --> 00:38:06.670 align:middle line:84%
You can derive this
constraint by saying

00:38:06.670 --> 00:38:09.940 align:middle line:84%
there's a maximum amount
they can invest in the firm.

00:38:09.940 --> 00:38:12.800 align:middle line:84%
Then you write down the
equation for borrowing,

00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:15.790 align:middle line:84%
which is the difference
between capital and assets.

00:38:15.790 --> 00:38:19.240 align:middle line:84%
And then substitute in that
maximum amount for capital

00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:21.130 align:middle line:90%
and derive this equation.

00:38:21.130 --> 00:38:23.890 align:middle line:84%
This now has a on both
sides of the equation, which

00:38:23.890 --> 00:38:24.550 align:middle line:90%
you could drop.

00:38:24.550 --> 00:38:27.200 align:middle line:84%
And you get the
equation 6 as a result.

00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:30.100 align:middle line:84%
But I'm perfectly happy if
you wanted to start with 6.

00:38:30.100 --> 00:38:34.540 align:middle line:84%
The capital is bounded from
above due to a collateral

00:38:34.540 --> 00:38:36.820 align:middle line:90%
constraint related to wealth.

00:38:36.820 --> 00:38:39.430 align:middle line:84%
That's the limited
liability version.

00:38:39.430 --> 00:38:41.410 align:middle line:90%
Here's the moral hazard version.

00:38:41.410 --> 00:38:46.060 align:middle line:84%
In this case, the bank does
not see the borrower's effort.

00:38:46.060 --> 00:38:49.540 align:middle line:84%
So whatever the contract is
in terms of that repayment

00:38:49.540 --> 00:38:53.530 align:middle line:84%
schedule, and whatever the
level of capitalization that

00:38:53.530 --> 00:38:58.150 align:middle line:84%
the borrower can manage, the
choice of how much to work is

00:38:58.150 --> 00:39:02.080 align:middle line:84%
done by the borrower alone
and cannot be dictated.

00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:06.380 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to be summarized
by a first-order condition,

00:39:06.380 --> 00:39:09.250 align:middle line:84%
which is like a solution
to the subproblem.

00:39:09.250 --> 00:39:11.020 align:middle line:90%
Which subproblem?

00:39:11.020 --> 00:39:13.670 align:middle line:90%
This subproblem here.

00:39:13.670 --> 00:39:17.710 align:middle line:84%
So this is the branch where the
household as firm is borrowing.

00:39:17.710 --> 00:39:22.930 align:middle line:84%
And its payoff in curly brackets
is, in part, a function of z.

00:39:22.930 --> 00:39:25.360 align:middle line:84%
So if you differentiate
this function

00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:27.400 align:middle line:84%
with respect to
effort, you're going

00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:30.070 align:middle line:84%
to get the way that the
probability of success

00:39:30.070 --> 00:39:31.720 align:middle line:90%
is increasing with effort.

00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:34.450 align:middle line:84%
You're going to get a part
with a negative sign reflecting

00:39:34.450 --> 00:39:35.980 align:middle line:90%
the utility of effort.

00:39:35.980 --> 00:39:41.110 align:middle line:84%
And this probability of success
is also entering into this--

00:39:41.110 --> 00:39:42.760 align:middle line:90%
It's like the winner's curse.

00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:43.630 align:middle line:90%
You win.

00:39:43.630 --> 00:39:45.460 align:middle line:90%
Your profits are successful.

00:39:45.460 --> 00:39:46.960 align:middle line:84%
But you've got to
pay off the bank.

00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:49.960 align:middle line:84%
So the harder you work,
the more you repay.

00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:52.240 align:middle line:90%
So take the derivative of this.

00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:54.190 align:middle line:84%
And you get this
first-order condition

00:39:54.190 --> 00:39:58.830 align:middle line:90%
over here, equation seven.

00:39:58.830 --> 00:40:03.220 align:middle line:84%
So that's the formality of it
that it captures the notion,

00:40:03.220 --> 00:40:06.600 align:middle line:84%
as I've said, that no matter
what contract the firm is

00:40:06.600 --> 00:40:10.620 align:middle line:84%
entering into, the bank cannot
see the borrower's effort

00:40:10.620 --> 00:40:13.950 align:middle line:84%
but knows how the borrower
is determining it.

00:40:13.950 --> 00:40:17.000 align:middle line:84%
So we get this equation
7 as another constraint

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:20.790 align:middle line:84%
on the program, if we believe
moral hazard is strained.

00:40:20.790 --> 00:40:23.730 align:middle line:90%
So we did limited liability.

00:40:23.730 --> 00:40:25.620 align:middle line:90%
We did moral hazard.

00:40:25.620 --> 00:40:27.210 align:middle line:90%
We could have both.

00:40:27.210 --> 00:40:31.560 align:middle line:84%
And now I'll show you
a very cool picture.

00:40:31.560 --> 00:40:36.600 align:middle line:84%
So this is utility of
a household as a firm.

00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:41.010 align:middle line:84%
But on the x and y-axis are
the inputs, the capital level

00:40:41.010 --> 00:40:42.930 align:middle line:90%
and the effort level.

00:40:42.930 --> 00:40:45.420 align:middle line:84%
If we did what we
would call first best,

00:40:45.420 --> 00:40:48.810 align:middle line:84%
meaning that we ignore
all the limited liability

00:40:48.810 --> 00:40:50.880 align:middle line:84%
and moral hazard
constraints, then

00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:55.110 align:middle line:84%
the borrower would maximize
these choices of capital

00:40:55.110 --> 00:40:58.950 align:middle line:84%
in effort, choose then
to have maximal utility.

00:40:58.950 --> 00:41:01.620 align:middle line:84%
And where is the
utility maximal utility?

00:41:01.620 --> 00:41:03.790 align:middle line:84%
It's in this bull's
eye over here.

00:41:03.790 --> 00:41:05.790 align:middle line:84%
So in other lectures,
we've talked

00:41:05.790 --> 00:41:10.410 align:middle line:84%
about bliss points, meaning,
if you're below bliss,

00:41:10.410 --> 00:41:13.080 align:middle line:90%
utility is increasing.

00:41:13.080 --> 00:41:15.870 align:middle line:84%
Or you could go
above bliss, which

00:41:15.870 --> 00:41:18.900 align:middle line:84%
is kind of weird, in which
case you want to dump stuff.

00:41:18.900 --> 00:41:21.420 align:middle line:84%
This is an endogenous
bliss point.

00:41:21.420 --> 00:41:24.700 align:middle line:84%
This came from solving
an underlying problem.

00:41:24.700 --> 00:41:27.900 align:middle line:84%
But we can, nevertheless,
plot the solution this way.

00:41:27.900 --> 00:41:29.910 align:middle line:90%
And where do they want to be?

00:41:29.910 --> 00:41:33.990 align:middle line:84%
As close to the bull's eye
as possible but not northeast

00:41:33.990 --> 00:41:35.330 align:middle line:90%
of it.

00:41:35.330 --> 00:41:38.960 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now what are the
constraints on the problem?

00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:41.640 align:middle line:84%
There's this
liability constraint,

00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:43.610 align:middle line:90%
which is capital times lambda.

00:41:43.610 --> 00:41:47.180 align:middle line:84%
And if that's the constraint
in the world and hence,

00:41:47.180 --> 00:41:49.700 align:middle line:84%
in the program, it
just simply says,

00:41:49.700 --> 00:41:51.710 align:middle line:84%
capital cannot be
to the right of it.

00:41:51.710 --> 00:41:53.570 align:middle line:84%
It can be to the
left of it or on it.

00:41:53.570 --> 00:41:56.720 align:middle line:84%
So all these solutions on
the vertical line and left

00:41:56.720 --> 00:42:00.350 align:middle line:84%
of the vertical line
correspond to satisfying this

00:42:00.350 --> 00:42:03.840 align:middle line:84%
capitalisation constraint
for a given value of lambda,

00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:06.110 align:middle line:84%
which is listed down here
at the bottom of the slide.

00:42:06.110 --> 00:42:08.300 align:middle line:84%
And where is the
maximal solution?

00:42:08.300 --> 00:42:11.120 align:middle line:90%
At the tangency right here.

00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:16.070 align:middle line:84%
That's where the slope of these
concentric rings goes vertical.

00:42:16.070 --> 00:42:18.240 align:middle line:90%
OK, let's do the moral hazard.

00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:21.450 align:middle line:84%
So ignore limited
liability constraint

00:42:21.450 --> 00:42:24.320 align:middle line:90%
and trace out this guy.

00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:26.690 align:middle line:84%
I did not a priori
what this constraint

00:42:26.690 --> 00:42:29.080 align:middle line:90%
was going to look like.

00:42:29.080 --> 00:42:35.680 align:middle line:84%
But if you plot it in the space
of k and z, it looks like this.

00:42:35.680 --> 00:42:37.530 align:middle line:90%
It's like this parabola.

00:42:37.530 --> 00:42:41.220 align:middle line:84%
Alex was my student and
RA for this project.

00:42:41.220 --> 00:42:44.220 align:middle line:84%
And Anna and I, former student,
were writing this paper.

00:42:44.220 --> 00:42:46.320 align:middle line:90%
We shared the problem with Alex.

00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:48.030 align:middle line:84%
And Alex came up
with this graph.

00:42:48.030 --> 00:42:51.540 align:middle line:84%
And Alex became a coauthor
of the paper and subsequence

00:42:51.540 --> 00:42:53.340 align:middle line:90%
collaborator in many things.

00:42:53.340 --> 00:42:55.000 align:middle line:90%
Anyway, I love this graph.

00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:58.380 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to satisfy
the moral hazard constraint,

00:42:58.380 --> 00:43:00.630 align:middle line:84%
you're going to be
on the parabola.

00:43:00.630 --> 00:43:02.400 align:middle line:90%
And where is the maximal point?

00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:05.610 align:middle line:84%
It's again, a tangency
with a concentric circle.

00:43:05.610 --> 00:43:07.330 align:middle line:90%
And it's right here.

00:43:07.330 --> 00:43:10.770 align:middle line:84%
So interestingly, if you
compare these two points,

00:43:10.770 --> 00:43:12.990 align:middle line:84%
the limited-liability
constrained solution

00:43:12.990 --> 00:43:14.880 align:middle line:84%
and the moral hazard
constrained solution,

00:43:14.880 --> 00:43:18.210 align:middle line:84%
limited liability involves
less capital and more effort

00:43:18.210 --> 00:43:21.120 align:middle line:84%
relative to the moral hazard
solution which kind of makes

00:43:21.120 --> 00:43:25.110 align:middle line:84%
sense because with moral hazard,
the problem is inducing effort,

00:43:25.110 --> 00:43:26.220 align:middle line:90%
not capital.

00:43:26.220 --> 00:43:28.350 align:middle line:84%
With limited
liability, the problem

00:43:28.350 --> 00:43:30.450 align:middle line:84%
is financing that
level of capital.

00:43:30.450 --> 00:43:32.310 align:middle line:90%
and effort's fully observed.

00:43:32.310 --> 00:43:35.220 align:middle line:84%
Now it turns out, if you
have both constraints,

00:43:35.220 --> 00:43:37.390 align:middle line:84%
in this world with
risk neutrality,

00:43:37.390 --> 00:43:38.730 align:middle line:90%
there's nothing to optimize.

00:43:38.730 --> 00:43:41.310 align:middle line:90%
It's like two lines cross.

00:43:41.310 --> 00:43:43.440 align:middle line:84%
Actually, technically,
it's a vertical line

00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:44.970 align:middle line:90%
crossing with a parabola.

00:43:44.970 --> 00:43:47.410 align:middle line:84%
But it completely nails
down the solution.

00:43:47.410 --> 00:43:51.190 align:middle line:84%
So k and z are at the
crossing over here.

00:43:51.190 --> 00:43:53.940 align:middle line:84%
So what we're doing
conceptually then

00:43:53.940 --> 00:43:56.520 align:middle line:84%
is loading in these
parameter values

00:43:56.520 --> 00:44:00.420 align:middle line:84%
for, in this case, a particular
talent level, particular asset

00:44:00.420 --> 00:44:03.180 align:middle line:84%
level, alpha in the
production function,

00:44:03.180 --> 00:44:05.670 align:middle line:84%
kappa, which is the
disutility of effort.

00:44:05.670 --> 00:44:08.160 align:middle line:84%
And the power is
lambda lambda, 1 is 0,

00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:12.450 align:middle line:84%
et cetera, solving the
model and delineating

00:44:12.450 --> 00:44:15.570 align:middle line:84%
what happens with these
various constraints, one,

00:44:15.570 --> 00:44:17.390 align:middle line:90%
the other, or both.

00:44:17.390 --> 00:44:21.120 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now we're going
to generalize this.

00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:25.620 align:middle line:84%
And in particular, we're going
to let there be some risk.

00:44:25.620 --> 00:44:27.180 align:middle line:90%
There is already risk.

00:44:27.180 --> 00:44:30.480 align:middle line:84%
But we're going to let the
household be risk-averse.

00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:35.730 align:middle line:84%
So their payoff can depend on
q, which they now care about.

00:44:35.730 --> 00:44:38.130 align:middle line:84%
The dispersion, because
they're risk-averse,

00:44:38.130 --> 00:44:42.510 align:middle line:84%
so there's a consumption,
this profit-sharing schedule.

00:44:42.510 --> 00:44:46.320 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to want to
solve for these probabilities.

00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:48.690 align:middle line:84%
This kind of came up in
the beginning of class,

00:44:48.690 --> 00:44:52.920 align:middle line:84%
this pi is a probability
number, an endogenous number

00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:55.930 align:middle line:84%
that reflects the solution
to a programming problem.

00:44:55.930 --> 00:44:57.750 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to
want to determine

00:44:57.750 --> 00:45:02.460 align:middle line:84%
the probability of seeing this
quadruple, a particular value

00:45:02.460 --> 00:45:07.800 align:middle line:84%
c, particular value of q, a
particular value of effort z,

00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:10.620 align:middle line:84%
and a particular
capitalization level, as

00:45:10.620 --> 00:45:13.860 align:middle line:84%
a function of observed and
unobserved characteristics

00:45:13.860 --> 00:45:17.940 align:middle line:84%
of the borrower, namely,
theta a and s, talent, assets,

00:45:17.940 --> 00:45:19.290 align:middle line:90%
and schooling.

00:45:19.290 --> 00:45:24.100 align:middle line:84%
So again, I don't remember
what slide it's on.

00:45:24.100 --> 00:45:26.100 align:middle line:84%
But we will determine
the solution

00:45:26.100 --> 00:45:28.800 align:middle line:90%
by these probabilities.

00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:30.660 align:middle line:90%
There are lotteries.

00:45:30.660 --> 00:45:35.290 align:middle line:84%
They will make our program and
turn it into a linear program.

00:45:35.290 --> 00:45:37.290 align:middle line:84%
And again, this is
a bit of a review,

00:45:37.290 --> 00:45:39.990 align:middle line:84%
but now in an interesting
applied context.

00:45:39.990 --> 00:45:43.140 align:middle line:84%
Remember, we had discrete
values for consumption

00:45:43.140 --> 00:45:45.480 align:middle line:84%
when we introduced
the notion of risk.

00:45:45.480 --> 00:45:47.880 align:middle line:84%
And we talked about
the probability pi,

00:45:47.880 --> 00:45:52.200 align:middle line:84%
of choosing a certain bundle,
discrete bundle, c, cs,

00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:56.610 align:middle line:84%
where s delineated all the
possible discrete values of c.

00:45:56.610 --> 00:45:58.710 align:middle line:84%
So that was one
place that we did it.

00:45:58.710 --> 00:45:59.940 align:middle line:90%
And there's been others.

00:45:59.940 --> 00:46:03.360 align:middle line:84%
But I don't have it right
off the top of my head.

00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:07.620 align:middle line:84%
Oh sorry, in the mechanism
design literature

00:46:07.620 --> 00:46:09.930 align:middle line:84%
in the previous
lecture we did it.

00:46:09.930 --> 00:46:12.780 align:middle line:84%
We had deterministic
programs and programs

00:46:12.780 --> 00:46:13.830 align:middle line:90%
with the lotteries.

00:46:13.830 --> 00:46:17.790 align:middle line:84%
So that's the second reason
to have the lotteries.

00:46:17.790 --> 00:46:21.040 align:middle line:84%
And I made the point there
that they were linear programs.

00:46:21.040 --> 00:46:24.330 align:middle line:84%
So despite putting in
truth-telling constraints,

00:46:24.330 --> 00:46:26.430 align:middle line:84%
when we have the
lotteries, the constraints

00:46:26.430 --> 00:46:30.340 align:middle line:84%
are linear in the pi and so
it was the objective function.

00:46:30.340 --> 00:46:33.360 align:middle line:84%
So here, we're going to have
these moral-hazard constraints,

00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:37.560 align:middle line:84%
et cetera, which could turn this
into a very nonlinear problem

00:46:37.560 --> 00:46:40.800 align:middle line:84%
because we have the
original maximum,

00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:43.515 align:middle line:84%
the objective function
subject to a derivative

00:46:43.515 --> 00:46:47.170 align:middle line:84%
of part of the maximized
function as a constraint.

00:46:47.170 --> 00:46:49.680 align:middle line:84%
And Lord knows what
that looks like.

00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:51.840 align:middle line:84%
But we turn it all into
a linear programming

00:46:51.840 --> 00:46:53.520 align:middle line:90%
problem with these lotteries.

00:46:53.520 --> 00:46:57.340 align:middle line:84%
Not only that, we're going
to imagine discrete values.

00:46:57.340 --> 00:46:59.370 align:middle line:84%
So it's not a
semi-infinite program.

00:46:59.370 --> 00:47:02.310 align:middle line:84%
It's a finite, discrete
linear program.

00:47:02.310 --> 00:47:05.310 align:middle line:84%
And that allows
capitalization to be chunky.

00:47:05.310 --> 00:47:09.360 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you get a machine or you
don't, for example, literally,

00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:10.890 align:middle line:90%
a discrete value.

00:47:10.890 --> 00:47:15.000 align:middle line:84%
That also causes a problem,
just the way chunky consumption

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:16.300 align:middle line:90%
causes a problem.

00:47:16.300 --> 00:47:17.400 align:middle line:90%
But never mind.

00:47:17.400 --> 00:47:19.390 align:middle line:90%
Lotteries are the cure-all.

00:47:19.390 --> 00:47:24.040 align:middle line:84%
It just always works
to turn it into this.

00:47:24.040 --> 00:47:26.190 align:middle line:90%
So don't pass out.

00:47:26.190 --> 00:47:29.830 align:middle line:84%
Each of these lines
will make sense to you.

00:47:29.830 --> 00:47:31.440 align:middle line:90%
This is the objective function.

00:47:31.440 --> 00:47:34.320 align:middle line:84%
It's the utility of the
household as a function

00:47:34.320 --> 00:47:36.420 align:middle line:90%
of consumption and effort.

00:47:36.420 --> 00:47:40.740 align:middle line:84%
This is expected utility
because part of the probability

00:47:40.740 --> 00:47:44.820 align:middle line:84%
involves consumption and effort,
which may potentially be chosen

00:47:44.820 --> 00:47:46.890 align:middle line:90%
at random, according to pi.

00:47:46.890 --> 00:47:50.460 align:middle line:84%
And then we sum up over all
these discrete values of c, q,

00:47:50.460 --> 00:47:52.980 align:middle line:84%
z, k, summing them up,
weighting them by pi.

00:47:52.980 --> 00:47:55.500 align:middle line:84%
So this whole thing is
just expected utility.

00:47:55.500 --> 00:47:57.600 align:middle line:84%
In this case, the
borrower's risk-averse.

00:47:57.600 --> 00:47:59.430 align:middle line:90%
So we're allowing for that.

00:47:59.430 --> 00:48:01.950 align:middle line:84%
Now this constraint
is what I call

00:48:01.950 --> 00:48:03.630 align:middle line:90%
a Mother-Nature constraint.

00:48:03.630 --> 00:48:07.890 align:middle line:84%
What Mother Nature is giving
us is the technology that maps

00:48:07.890 --> 00:48:12.720 align:middle line:84%
z and k along with theta into
the probability of success, q.

00:48:12.720 --> 00:48:15.810 align:middle line:84%
So this p tilde
function is given.

00:48:15.810 --> 00:48:17.790 align:middle line:84%
It's part of the
underlying environment.

00:48:17.790 --> 00:48:19.980 align:middle line:84%
But you might think
that, in part, we're

00:48:19.980 --> 00:48:23.490 align:middle line:84%
solving for the relationship,
the probabilistic relationship

00:48:23.490 --> 00:48:26.970 align:middle line:84%
between q, z, and k because
everything looks endogenous up

00:48:26.970 --> 00:48:27.820 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:48:27.820 --> 00:48:29.820 align:middle line:84%
So we need to impose
another constraint

00:48:29.820 --> 00:48:32.760 align:middle line:84%
to make sure we respect
the Mother Nature.

00:48:32.760 --> 00:48:34.920 align:middle line:84%
And if little
statistics, this is

00:48:34.920 --> 00:48:37.770 align:middle line:84%
like the probability of
a conditioned on event

00:48:37.770 --> 00:48:40.470 align:middle line:84%
b times the
probability of event b

00:48:40.470 --> 00:48:43.830 align:middle line:84%
is therefore the probability
of the joint event a and b.

00:48:43.830 --> 00:48:45.600 align:middle line:84%
And on the left-hand
side, it's already

00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:47.610 align:middle line:90%
the joint event, a and b.

00:48:47.610 --> 00:48:51.840 align:middle line:84%
So this is the probability
of q, conditioned on z and k.

00:48:51.840 --> 00:48:54.030 align:middle line:84%
This is the
probability of z and k

00:48:54.030 --> 00:48:57.390 align:middle line:84%
because we've integrated out
the other objects, z and q.

00:48:57.390 --> 00:49:00.990 align:middle line:84%
So this is the
probability of q, z, k.

00:49:00.990 --> 00:49:04.860 align:middle line:84%
And likewise, the left-hand side
is the probability of q, z, k,

00:49:04.860 --> 00:49:08.400 align:middle line:84%
where we somehow integrate out
the only other object, the c.

00:49:08.400 --> 00:49:10.920 align:middle line:84%
So this is a
Mother-Nature constraint.

00:49:10.920 --> 00:49:13.560 align:middle line:84%
Again, it's all
linear in the pis.

00:49:13.560 --> 00:49:16.440 align:middle line:90%
So we just code it in to Matlab.

00:49:16.440 --> 00:49:18.840 align:middle line:84%
This thing down here is
the break-even constrain

00:49:18.840 --> 00:49:19.740 align:middle line:90%
for the bank.

00:49:19.740 --> 00:49:22.230 align:middle line:84%
And you can think of
it as maybe the bank

00:49:22.230 --> 00:49:25.890 align:middle line:84%
has to pay out more in
consumption than output.

00:49:25.890 --> 00:49:28.890 align:middle line:84%
In this case, by the way, when
the firm is not successful,

00:49:28.890 --> 00:49:30.210 align:middle line:90%
the output is 0.

00:49:30.210 --> 00:49:32.400 align:middle line:84%
But the borrower is
risk-averse and it's

00:49:32.400 --> 00:49:36.270 align:middle line:84%
going to view it as a disaster
to get 0 consumption, maybe

00:49:36.270 --> 00:49:38.820 align:middle line:90%
even minus infinity utility.

00:49:38.820 --> 00:49:40.740 align:middle line:84%
So typically, in
the failure branch,

00:49:40.740 --> 00:49:42.270 align:middle line:90%
consumption is greater than q.

00:49:42.270 --> 00:49:45.240 align:middle line:84%
That means the bank, which
is like taking all of the q

00:49:45.240 --> 00:49:46.860 align:middle line:84%
and giving some of
it back in terms

00:49:46.860 --> 00:49:50.340 align:middle line:84%
of c is suffering a loss
on the consumption part.

00:49:50.340 --> 00:49:52.800 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand, on
the right-hand side,

00:49:52.800 --> 00:49:54.660 align:middle line:84%
it's like the
firm, the household

00:49:54.660 --> 00:49:58.620 align:middle line:84%
as a firm is surrendering all
of its assets a to the bank

00:49:58.620 --> 00:49:59.550 align:middle line:90%
to manage.

00:49:59.550 --> 00:50:03.180 align:middle line:84%
And only some of it
gets used to finance.

00:50:03.180 --> 00:50:06.090 align:middle line:84%
So the firms make a profit
on the right-hand side,

00:50:06.090 --> 00:50:08.550 align:middle line:84%
times the difference
the bank got

00:50:08.550 --> 00:50:11.760 align:middle line:84%
that it didn't give back, times
the external outside interest

00:50:11.760 --> 00:50:12.400 align:middle line:90%
rate.

00:50:12.400 --> 00:50:16.230 align:middle line:84%
So this is a zero break-even
constraint with the lotteries.

00:50:16.230 --> 00:50:18.220 align:middle line:90%
This is moral hazard.

00:50:18.220 --> 00:50:20.370 align:middle line:90%
It's akin to truth-telling.

00:50:20.370 --> 00:50:23.760 align:middle line:84%
So what this says
is, the truth is

00:50:23.760 --> 00:50:28.440 align:middle line:84%
that not only does the borrower
characterize by theta a and s.

00:50:28.440 --> 00:50:32.670 align:middle line:84%
The borrower contemplates
doing the recommended action z.

00:50:32.670 --> 00:50:35.460 align:middle line:84%
How much effort is supposed to
be applied under the contract?

00:50:35.460 --> 00:50:38.070 align:middle line:84%
But you can't make
the borrower do it.

00:50:38.070 --> 00:50:41.370 align:middle line:84%
The borrower has to be given
incentive to work, especially

00:50:41.370 --> 00:50:43.650 align:middle line:90%
if this is a high level of z.

00:50:43.650 --> 00:50:46.660 align:middle line:84%
But the borrower says,
nah, I might not do it.

00:50:46.660 --> 00:50:49.980 align:middle line:84%
So even though z was
recommended by the bank,

00:50:49.980 --> 00:50:51.750 align:middle line:84%
the borrower does
something else.

00:50:51.750 --> 00:50:53.910 align:middle line:90%
The borrower does z prime.

00:50:53.910 --> 00:50:57.460 align:middle line:84%
Note that z prime is entering
into the utility function here.

00:50:57.460 --> 00:51:01.630 align:middle line:84%
So he really is going to do that
or is thinking about doing it.

00:51:01.630 --> 00:51:03.630 align:middle line:84%
And this would be the
utility consequence.

00:51:03.630 --> 00:51:07.470 align:middle line:84%
This stupid thing here, we have
to readjust the probabilities

00:51:07.470 --> 00:51:10.620 align:middle line:84%
because when we impose that
Mother-Nature constraint,

00:51:10.620 --> 00:51:12.930 align:middle line:84%
we embedded the
probability of success

00:51:12.930 --> 00:51:15.090 align:middle line:90%
into the endogenous object.

00:51:15.090 --> 00:51:18.600 align:middle line:84%
We would now be making
an error if we did not

00:51:18.600 --> 00:51:20.790 align:middle line:84%
adjust for the fact that
the effort being taken

00:51:20.790 --> 00:51:23.670 align:middle line:90%
is z prime rather than z.

00:51:23.670 --> 00:51:26.190 align:middle line:84%
And this is derived
in one of my papers.

00:51:26.190 --> 00:51:28.380 align:middle line:84%
Hopefully, it's somewhat
intuitive that at least one

00:51:28.380 --> 00:51:30.540 align:middle line:90%
needs to do an adjustment.

00:51:30.540 --> 00:51:34.200 align:middle line:84%
And finally, this just says the
probabilities all add up to 1.

00:51:34.200 --> 00:51:37.950 align:middle line:84%
So the programming
problem is to maximize

00:51:37.950 --> 00:51:39.960 align:middle line:84%
the expected utility
of the borrower,

00:51:39.960 --> 00:51:42.720 align:middle line:84%
subject to all
these constraints,

00:51:42.720 --> 00:51:44.100 align:middle line:90%
Mother-Nature constraints.

00:51:44.100 --> 00:51:45.330 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot of them.

00:51:45.330 --> 00:51:49.140 align:middle line:84%
For every q, z, and k, this
is the break-even constraint.

00:51:49.140 --> 00:51:50.590 align:middle line:90%
There's only one of them.

00:51:50.590 --> 00:51:53.190 align:middle line:84%
This is the
moral-hazard constraint

00:51:53.190 --> 00:51:55.710 align:middle line:84%
to be obedient
rather than shirk.

00:51:55.710 --> 00:51:57.990 align:middle line:84%
And there's one of
these for every k.

00:51:57.990 --> 00:51:59.850 align:middle line:84%
That could be assigned
and then for every z,

00:51:59.850 --> 00:52:01.650 align:middle line:90%
an alternative value z prime.

00:52:01.650 --> 00:52:03.870 align:middle line:84%
And there's only one of
these constraints 11.

00:52:03.870 --> 00:52:07.080 align:middle line:84%
So I'm actually enumerating
the set of all constraints.

00:52:07.080 --> 00:52:10.860 align:middle line:84%
You can solve these things
for a large number of control

00:52:10.860 --> 00:52:13.140 align:middle line:90%
variables pi, like thousands.

00:52:13.140 --> 00:52:15.990 align:middle line:84%
And you can have
hundreds of constraints.

00:52:15.990 --> 00:52:20.010 align:middle line:84%
And it's still solvable
in things like CPLEX,

00:52:20.010 --> 00:52:22.620 align:middle line:84%
which is a version
of which Gorubi

00:52:22.620 --> 00:52:25.330 align:middle line:90%
is publicly available software.

00:52:25.330 --> 00:52:28.210 align:middle line:84%
So we did this before
Gorubi was on the market.

00:52:28.210 --> 00:52:31.420 align:middle line:84%
So we paid $2,000 to
get a hold of CPLEX.

00:52:31.420 --> 00:52:33.990 align:middle line:84%
And we solved the linear
programming problem.

00:52:33.990 --> 00:52:36.100 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to call the
solution the probability

00:52:36.100 --> 00:52:37.630 align:middle line:90%
of being an entrepreneur.

00:52:37.630 --> 00:52:39.850 align:middle line:84%
It's a pretty brute
force, namely,

00:52:39.850 --> 00:52:42.250 align:middle line:84%
what is the probability the
capital level is positive?

00:52:42.250 --> 00:52:44.680 align:middle line:84%
If it's positive, they
must be a firm, the way

00:52:44.680 --> 00:52:46.210 align:middle line:90%
we composed the problem.

00:52:46.210 --> 00:52:48.250 align:middle line:84%
If capital were 0,
they're a wage earner.

00:52:48.250 --> 00:52:50.980 align:middle line:84%
So ignoring everything
else by summing up

00:52:50.980 --> 00:52:53.740 align:middle line:84%
over everything else, we
only care about capital

00:52:53.740 --> 00:52:54.550 align:middle line:90%
being positive.

00:52:54.550 --> 00:52:56.800 align:middle line:84%
And we call that the
probability of being a firm.

00:52:56.800 --> 00:53:00.070 align:middle line:84%
It's still conditioned on
talent, assets, and schooling.

00:53:00.070 --> 00:53:03.400 align:middle line:84%
So we have to solve this problem
for all those stratifications

00:53:03.400 --> 00:53:05.030 align:middle line:90%
in the data.

00:53:05.030 --> 00:53:06.760 align:middle line:90%
So let me go back again.

00:53:06.760 --> 00:53:08.440 align:middle line:90%
Is it a moral-hazard problem?

00:53:08.440 --> 00:53:10.720 align:middle line:84%
Is it a limited-liability
problem?

00:53:10.720 --> 00:53:11.530 align:middle line:90%
Is it both?

00:53:11.530 --> 00:53:12.730 align:middle line:90%
Is it neither?

00:53:12.730 --> 00:53:17.150 align:middle line:84%
So we have the master program
here that allows everything.

00:53:17.150 --> 00:53:21.280 align:middle line:84%
All we have to do is comment
out the relevant constraint.

00:53:21.280 --> 00:53:25.710 align:middle line:90%
If we want to look at the--

00:53:25.710 --> 00:53:27.810 align:middle line:84%
It should have
been written here.

00:53:27.810 --> 00:53:30.270 align:middle line:84%
If we want to delete the
moral-hazard constraint,

00:53:30.270 --> 00:53:33.330 align:middle line:84%
we comment out this
thing, equation 10.

00:53:33.330 --> 00:53:36.540 align:middle line:84%
And there's a limited-liability
constraint, which somehow I'm

00:53:36.540 --> 00:53:38.530 align:middle line:90%
not seeing in the notation.

00:53:38.530 --> 00:53:39.900 align:middle line:90%
But it should have been there.

00:53:39.900 --> 00:53:41.880 align:middle line:90%
And we can comment it out.

00:53:41.880 --> 00:53:44.760 align:middle line:84%
We can allow both moral
hazard and limited liability.

00:53:44.760 --> 00:53:46.362 align:middle line:90%
Or we could have neither.

00:53:46.362 --> 00:53:48.570 align:middle line:84%
Once you go to all the
trouble to code this thing up,

00:53:48.570 --> 00:53:51.480 align:middle line:84%
it's not hard to do all
these different combinations

00:53:51.480 --> 00:53:53.050 align:middle line:90%
and take it to the data.

00:53:53.050 --> 00:53:56.210 align:middle line:90%
So how do we go to the data?

00:53:56.210 --> 00:53:59.860 align:middle line:90%
We compute.

00:53:59.860 --> 00:54:03.280 align:middle line:84%
So again, I'm not being shy
about this because we advertise

00:54:03.280 --> 00:54:06.220 align:middle line:84%
that numerical methods are
important at the beginning

00:54:06.220 --> 00:54:06.950 align:middle line:90%
of the class.

00:54:06.950 --> 00:54:09.250 align:middle line:84%
So I do want occasionally
to show you how

00:54:09.250 --> 00:54:11.780 align:middle line:90%
numerical methods can get used.

00:54:11.780 --> 00:54:14.530 align:middle line:84%
And also, I know you
guys are a great class.

00:54:14.530 --> 00:54:17.620 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not worried that this
is necessarily too hard.

00:54:17.620 --> 00:54:20.290 align:middle line:84%
But it may be the first
time that you've seen it,

00:54:20.290 --> 00:54:21.790 align:middle line:84%
which is kind of
cool because you'll

00:54:21.790 --> 00:54:24.350 align:middle line:90%
learn about maximum likelihood.

00:54:24.350 --> 00:54:25.840 align:middle line:90%
So what do we do?

00:54:25.840 --> 00:54:29.950 align:middle line:84%
Let's fix all the parameters,
alpha, kappa, all of them,

00:54:29.950 --> 00:54:31.090 align:middle line:90%
a whole array of them--

00:54:31.090 --> 00:54:32.830 align:middle line:84%
I have that on
the slide coming--

00:54:32.830 --> 00:54:35.200 align:middle line:84%
and solve that
programming problem

00:54:35.200 --> 00:54:39.790 align:middle line:84%
for the stratification of
ability, education, and wealth.

00:54:39.790 --> 00:54:42.760 align:middle line:84%
And say, do that for
the moral-hazard regime.

00:54:42.760 --> 00:54:44.770 align:middle line:84%
Let's keep moral
hazard in mind now.

00:54:44.770 --> 00:54:46.490 align:middle line:90%
Drop limited liability.

00:54:46.490 --> 00:54:49.720 align:middle line:84%
Now we want to construct the
likelihood function, which

00:54:49.720 --> 00:54:52.900 align:middle line:84%
is for given parameter
values, the model

00:54:52.900 --> 00:54:57.850 align:middle line:84%
predicts the probability of
being a firm for households

00:54:57.850 --> 00:54:59.790 align:middle line:90%
of this type.

00:54:59.790 --> 00:55:01.790 align:middle line:90%
The model tells us that.

00:55:01.790 --> 00:55:05.890 align:middle line:84%
And in the data,
we see the number,

00:55:05.890 --> 00:55:11.860 align:middle line:84%
the fraction of the sample
that are firms in that wealth,

00:55:11.860 --> 00:55:14.080 align:middle line:90%
talent, schooling, category.

00:55:14.080 --> 00:55:18.220 align:middle line:84%
So there may be a bit of
a mismatch in the sense

00:55:18.220 --> 00:55:21.340 align:middle line:84%
that for given parameter
values, the probability

00:55:21.340 --> 00:55:25.040 align:middle line:84%
is low in the model and very
high on the data or vice versa.

00:55:25.040 --> 00:55:27.370 align:middle line:84%
So then logically, oh
well, we can play around

00:55:27.370 --> 00:55:28.520 align:middle line:90%
with the parameter values.

00:55:28.520 --> 00:55:30.880 align:middle line:84%
We don't know what
they are either.

00:55:30.880 --> 00:55:35.680 align:middle line:84%
So we vary, kappa and alpha
and all of those things,

00:55:35.680 --> 00:55:41.290 align:middle line:84%
to make the likelihood to
maximize the probability

00:55:41.290 --> 00:55:45.790 align:middle line:84%
that we would see in the data
what is predicted by the model.

00:55:45.790 --> 00:55:48.250 align:middle line:84%
Maximize the
probability, we would see

00:55:48.250 --> 00:55:50.590 align:middle line:90%
in the data, which is a given.

00:55:50.590 --> 00:55:52.620 align:middle line:90%
But it's predicted by the model.

00:55:52.620 --> 00:55:55.930 align:middle line:84%
And again, the choice is varying
over all possible parameter

00:55:55.930 --> 00:55:56.820 align:middle line:90%
values.

00:55:56.820 --> 00:56:00.130 align:middle line:84%
Now that doesn't mean the
likelihood will match exactly.

00:56:00.130 --> 00:56:02.380 align:middle line:84%
It just means the
likelihood is as high

00:56:02.380 --> 00:56:05.860 align:middle line:84%
as it can possibly be after
searching over all parameter

00:56:05.860 --> 00:56:06.620 align:middle line:90%
values.

00:56:06.620 --> 00:56:09.100 align:middle line:84%
Here's a bit more
of the math of it.

00:56:09.100 --> 00:56:11.830 align:middle line:84%
The string of
parameter values would

00:56:11.830 --> 00:56:17.380 align:middle line:84%
be risk aversion, work aversion,
the weight on disutility

00:56:17.380 --> 00:56:21.130 align:middle line:84%
in the work part, alpha in
the production function,

00:56:21.130 --> 00:56:25.720 align:middle line:84%
delta 0, 1, 2, which are the
weights on theta A, theta

00:56:25.720 --> 00:56:28.210 align:middle line:84%
and S, I think, or the
other way around, lambda

00:56:28.210 --> 00:56:30.170 align:middle line:84%
being the limited-liability
constraint.

00:56:30.170 --> 00:56:33.370 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to maximize
over all these parameters

00:56:33.370 --> 00:56:38.350 align:middle line:84%
and get something like H of A
to be the probability of being

00:56:38.350 --> 00:56:41.830 align:middle line:84%
a firm, conditioned
on wealth A. And it

00:56:41.830 --> 00:56:44.380 align:middle line:84%
should have had schooling
in here but not talent.

00:56:44.380 --> 00:56:46.280 align:middle line:84%
We had to integrate
out over talent.

00:56:46.280 --> 00:56:50.440 align:middle line:84%
So this object comes from
the model conditioning

00:56:50.440 --> 00:56:52.720 align:middle line:84%
on the stratification
in the data

00:56:52.720 --> 00:56:54.680 align:middle line:84%
and a string of
parameter values.

00:56:54.680 --> 00:56:58.480 align:middle line:84%
So when we say maximize the
likelihood, L, likelihood,

00:56:58.480 --> 00:57:00.910 align:middle line:84%
is a function of the
parameter values, which

00:57:00.910 --> 00:57:04.110 align:middle line:90%
we will vary, to maximize what?

00:57:04.110 --> 00:57:07.040 align:middle line:84%
Ei is a statement
about the data.

00:57:07.040 --> 00:57:08.800 align:middle line:90%
It's 0 or 1.

00:57:08.800 --> 00:57:11.870 align:middle line:84%
Household i is either a firm
or it isn't in the data.

00:57:11.870 --> 00:57:13.150 align:middle line:90%
So we count up the number.

00:57:13.150 --> 00:57:17.080 align:middle line:84%
Every time a household
is in the data as a firm,

00:57:17.080 --> 00:57:19.900 align:middle line:84%
we look at the associated
probability of predicting that

00:57:19.900 --> 00:57:21.380 align:middle line:90%
from the model.

00:57:21.380 --> 00:57:26.930 align:middle line:84%
This is a probability, likewise,
logs make it the same function.

00:57:26.930 --> 00:57:29.170 align:middle line:84%
It's just a monotone
function of the probability.

00:57:29.170 --> 00:57:31.000 align:middle line:84%
And logs are cool
because they allow

00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:33.100 align:middle line:84%
you to write everything
is separable instead

00:57:33.100 --> 00:57:34.360 align:middle line:90%
of multiplicative.

00:57:34.360 --> 00:57:38.050 align:middle line:84%
Here's the other event, a
given household in the data

00:57:38.050 --> 00:57:39.010 align:middle line:90%
is not a firm.

00:57:39.010 --> 00:57:39.910 align:middle line:90%
It's a wage earner.

00:57:39.910 --> 00:57:42.550 align:middle line:90%
So one minus 0 is 1.

00:57:42.550 --> 00:57:44.320 align:middle line:90%
So this branch is wage earner.

00:57:44.320 --> 00:57:46.930 align:middle line:84%
And what's the probability
of being a wage earner?

00:57:46.930 --> 00:57:49.450 align:middle line:84%
It's 1 minus the
probability of being a firm.

00:57:49.450 --> 00:57:53.410 align:middle line:84%
So this is the likelihood
function, the log likelihood

00:57:53.410 --> 00:57:56.120 align:middle line:84%
function, a function
of the parameters.

00:57:56.120 --> 00:57:58.540 align:middle line:84%
And this is where the
code is maximized.

00:57:58.540 --> 00:58:00.220 align:middle line:90%
This is not linear code.

00:58:00.220 --> 00:58:03.130 align:middle line:84%
This is nonlinear
optimization code.

00:58:03.130 --> 00:58:06.430 align:middle line:84%
But there are many routines
out there to do this.

00:58:06.430 --> 00:58:09.250 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't want to think
about maximizing its nonlinear

00:58:09.250 --> 00:58:11.470 align:middle line:84%
function, you can
just evaluate it

00:58:11.470 --> 00:58:14.530 align:middle line:84%
at thousands of these
parameter configurations

00:58:14.530 --> 00:58:19.240 align:middle line:84%
and pick the max, which actually
gets close to the maximum.

00:58:19.240 --> 00:58:22.210 align:middle line:84%
So too tiny to read,
but conceptually,

00:58:22.210 --> 00:58:25.780 align:middle line:84%
we have a moral hazard column,
a limited liability column,

00:58:25.780 --> 00:58:27.610 align:middle line:90%
and both constraints column.

00:58:27.610 --> 00:58:31.220 align:middle line:84%
And what we're doing with
various specifications,

00:58:31.220 --> 00:58:33.850 align:middle line:84%
including this one,
estimating talent,

00:58:33.850 --> 00:58:37.370 align:middle line:84%
is reporting the maximized
parameter values.

00:58:37.370 --> 00:58:41.040 align:middle line:84%
So again, that vector string was
gamma 1, gamma 2, kappa, and so

00:58:41.040 --> 00:58:41.540 align:middle line:90%
on.

00:58:41.540 --> 00:58:43.300 align:middle line:84%
And you can see the
point estimates.

00:58:43.300 --> 00:58:46.000 align:middle line:84%
For risk aversion,
which was gamma 1,

00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:51.040 align:middle line:84%
we're getting the point
estimates here of 0.06 or 0.02.

00:58:51.040 --> 00:58:53.050 align:middle line:84%
So almost risk
neutral, actually.

00:58:53.050 --> 00:58:56.330 align:middle line:84%
But in parentheses
is a standard error,

00:58:56.330 --> 00:58:58.720 align:middle line:84%
which is expressed a
degree of confidence

00:58:58.720 --> 00:59:00.340 align:middle line:90%
about the point estimates.

00:59:00.340 --> 00:59:02.080 align:middle line:84%
So those are the
parameter estimates.

00:59:02.080 --> 00:59:03.710 align:middle line:90%
So what do we find?

00:59:03.710 --> 00:59:07.720 align:middle line:84%
We find at the end of the day,
a couple of years of research,

00:59:07.720 --> 00:59:11.080 align:middle line:84%
that the central region
favors moral hazard.

00:59:11.080 --> 00:59:13.690 align:middle line:84%
And likewise, in
the cross section,

00:59:13.690 --> 00:59:19.030 align:middle line:84%
as we increased the wealth going
from one household to the next,

00:59:19.030 --> 00:59:21.250 align:middle line:84%
an increase in
wealth is associated

00:59:21.250 --> 00:59:24.680 align:middle line:84%
with an increase in net
saving, which we also measured.

00:59:24.680 --> 00:59:27.670 align:middle line:84%
So this is consistent with
moral hazard in the slide

00:59:27.670 --> 00:59:29.140 align:middle line:90%
I showed you at the beginning.

00:59:29.140 --> 00:59:31.690 align:middle line:84%
That if it's moral hazard
and you have higher wealth,

00:59:31.690 --> 00:59:34.870 align:middle line:84%
you avoid the damage caused
by the moral hazard constraint

00:59:34.870 --> 00:59:36.520 align:middle line:90%
by self-financing.

00:59:36.520 --> 00:59:39.220 align:middle line:84%
So you should be saving
more as wealth goes up.

00:59:39.220 --> 00:59:41.740 align:middle line:84%
In the Northeast, the
story is different.

00:59:41.740 --> 00:59:44.410 align:middle line:84%
Being constrained, like
below the constraint

00:59:44.410 --> 00:59:46.930 align:middle line:84%
or at the constraint,
is not related

00:59:46.930 --> 00:59:48.940 align:middle line:90%
to borrowing particularly.

00:59:48.940 --> 00:59:52.060 align:middle line:84%
Now it is true that if you were
at a constraint, the liability

00:59:52.060 --> 00:59:54.850 align:middle line:84%
constraint, and
wealth went up, then

00:59:54.850 --> 00:59:57.170 align:middle line:84%
they'd all be constrained
by definition.

00:59:57.170 --> 00:59:58.990 align:middle line:84%
But there's a branch
of entrepreneurs,

00:59:58.990 --> 01:00:01.540 align:middle line:84%
depending on talent,
like if talent is low,

01:00:01.540 --> 01:00:03.370 align:middle line:84%
their wealth is
more than adequate.

01:00:03.370 --> 01:00:05.500 align:middle line:84%
So they may not be
borrowing at all.

01:00:05.500 --> 01:00:07.660 align:middle line:84%
And likewise here,
we get the opposite

01:00:07.660 --> 01:00:10.690 align:middle line:84%
that when wealth goes up for
constrained entrepreneurs,

01:00:10.690 --> 01:00:11.890 align:middle line:90%
borrowing goes up.

01:00:11.890 --> 01:00:14.380 align:middle line:84%
But again, there's this
branch of entrepreneurs that

01:00:14.380 --> 01:00:16.540 align:middle line:90%
are not necessarily borrowing.

01:00:16.540 --> 01:00:18.970 align:middle line:84%
So that wording on that
bottom bullet point

01:00:18.970 --> 01:00:20.570 align:middle line:90%
is a bit difficult.

01:00:20.570 --> 01:00:23.860 align:middle line:84%
So we have succeeded
to solve the problem.

01:00:23.860 --> 01:00:28.480 align:middle line:84%
We've identified the constraints
that limit small businesses.

01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:30.250 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly, the
constraints are

01:00:30.250 --> 01:00:33.370 align:middle line:84%
different in the different
regions, in the industrialized

01:00:33.370 --> 01:00:36.460 align:middle line:84%
area near Bangkok,
which are very urban--

01:00:36.460 --> 01:00:39.250 align:middle line:84%
one of these villages is across
the road from a Ford Motor

01:00:39.250 --> 01:00:41.240 align:middle line:90%
Company plant, for example--

01:00:41.240 --> 01:00:43.570 align:middle line:84%
it looks like moral
hazard's the problem.

01:00:43.570 --> 01:00:46.220 align:middle line:84%
Out in the Northeast,
the problem,

01:00:46.220 --> 01:00:49.120 align:middle line:84%
which is agrarian,
mostly rural, the problem

01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:53.830 align:middle line:84%
seems to be there's a very
limited financing constraint,

01:00:53.830 --> 01:00:54.790 align:middle line:90%
limited liability.

01:00:54.790 --> 01:00:57.310 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of the households
don't have a lot of wealth

01:00:57.310 --> 01:01:01.090 align:middle line:84%
so they're either constrained or
don't go into business at all.

01:01:01.090 --> 01:01:03.280 align:middle line:84%
Now we're not doing
a policy thing here.

01:01:03.280 --> 01:01:05.980 align:middle line:84%
But it would be good for
policymakers to know this

01:01:05.980 --> 01:01:08.380 align:middle line:84%
because if they want to
alleviate the constraints

01:01:08.380 --> 01:01:11.440 align:middle line:84%
on small businesses, they
should direct their policy

01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:15.010 align:middle line:84%
toward maybe in the Northeast,
allowing more assets

01:01:15.010 --> 01:01:17.950 align:middle line:84%
to qualify as
collateral, not just land

01:01:17.950 --> 01:01:21.010 align:middle line:84%
but their motorcycles,
which they finally did,

01:01:21.010 --> 01:01:24.940 align:middle line:84%
and other things, putting it
in escrow to allow or to have

01:01:24.940 --> 01:01:26.650 align:middle line:84%
the bank to have a
claim on it and allow

01:01:26.650 --> 01:01:28.180 align:middle line:90%
to increase borrowing.

01:01:28.180 --> 01:01:30.500 align:middle line:84%
In the central, area it's
an information problem.

01:01:30.500 --> 01:01:32.950 align:middle line:84%
So there, if you're
determined to try to solve it,

01:01:32.950 --> 01:01:34.820 align:middle line:90%
it must be better monitoring.

01:01:34.820 --> 01:01:37.690 align:middle line:84%
You need better signals
of the underlying effort

01:01:37.690 --> 01:01:41.320 align:middle line:84%
by, well, let's try
costly state verification,

01:01:41.320 --> 01:01:44.020 align:middle line:84%
for example, which is something
I talked about last time.

01:01:44.020 --> 01:01:46.120 align:middle line:84%
Not with respect to
verifying output.

01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:48.970 align:middle line:84%
But with respect to
getting reliable signals

01:01:48.970 --> 01:01:51.550 align:middle line:84%
of the underlying
effort of the borrower.

01:01:51.550 --> 01:01:54.790 align:middle line:84%
OK so this is the economic
science part of it.

01:01:54.790 --> 01:01:55.660 align:middle line:90%
We have models.

01:01:55.660 --> 01:01:56.320 align:middle line:90%
We have data.

01:01:56.320 --> 01:01:58.790 align:middle line:84%
We're trying to get as close
to the data as possible.

01:01:58.790 --> 01:02:02.170 align:middle line:84%
We're also solving an
interesting financing,

01:02:02.170 --> 01:02:04.520 align:middle line:84%
getting understanding of
the financing constraint.

01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:06.730 align:middle line:84%
And thinking about how
policy would change,

01:02:06.730 --> 01:02:10.040 align:middle line:84%
depending on what we find out
rather than one size fits all.

01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:12.550 align:middle line:90%
So that's all I have for today.

01:02:12.550 --> 01:02:15.360 align:middle line:90%
OK, thank you very much.

01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:22.384 align:middle line:90%

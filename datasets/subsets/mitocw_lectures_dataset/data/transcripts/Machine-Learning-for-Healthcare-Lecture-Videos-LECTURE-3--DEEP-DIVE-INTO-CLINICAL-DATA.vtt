WEBVTT

00:00:15.775 --> 00:00:17.400
PETER SZOLOVITS: So
last time we talked

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.580
about what medicine
does, and today I

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.330
want to take a deep
dive into medical data.

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.800
And I'm going to use as examples
a lot of stuff from the MIMIC

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.470
database, which is
one of the databases

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.180
that we're going to be
using in this class.

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.480
Some of you are probably
familiar with it,

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.670
and some of you are not.

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.280
And there are, I hope,
some takeaway lessons

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.600
from this discussion.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.450
So for example, a
few years ago, when

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.630
MIMIC-III was about
to be released,

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:54.270
I was playing with
the data, and I

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.440
looked at the distribution
of heart rates

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.660
in the CareVue part
of the database.

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.690
So MIMIC, for those
of you who don't know,

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:10.410
has intensive care data from
about 60-something thousand

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:13.380
admissions to intensive care
units at the Beth Israel

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.720
Deaconess Medical Center over
a period of about 12 years.

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.960
And one of the
technical difficulties

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.440
that we encountered is that in
the middle of that time period.

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.040
The hospitals shifted from
one information system

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.190
that they used in their
intensive care unit to another.

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:33.480
CareVue is the old one.

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.310
MetaVision is the new one.

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.420
And of course, they're
not exactly compatible.

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.510
So we'll see some
examples of that.

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:41.980
So this is the old data.

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.100
So this is from CareVue.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.650
And you look at that and
say, well, heart rates

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:53.250
range from 40 to 200
roughly, which is OK.

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.380
But then there's
this funny thing.

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.900
There are two peaks.

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:02.070
So where, if ever,
do you see two peaks

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.890
in physiological data?

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.380
Not typical.

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.043
And so my initial reaction was--

00:02:14.043 --> 00:02:17.001
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.170
So then I looked
a little closer,

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.650
and I said, hmm, what
do the heart rates look

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.450
like from these two systems?

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.660
And if you look in CareVue,
you see the picture

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:30.620
that I just showed you.

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.690
And if you look
in MetaVision, you

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.300
see this other picture,
which looks more like what

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.610
you would normally expect.

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.940
And so I'm sitting there
scratching my head going,

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.790
OK, there must be some
difference between these.

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.740
It's not that simultaneous
with the switchover

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:53.060
of the hospital from one
information system to another.

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.430
Physiology of people
changed, and all

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.580
of a sudden some
subset of people

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.950
started having
faster heart rates.

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:02.930
Right?

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.510
But if you think about
that what subset of people

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.118
have faster heart rates?

00:03:08.118 --> 00:03:08.910
AUDIENCE: Athletes.

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:10.380
PETER SZOLOVITS: Hmm?

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.320
AUDIENCE: Babies?

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.280
AUDIENCE: If you're
in a stress test.

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.210
PETER SZOLOVITS: Unh-hmm.

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:18.252
AUDIENCE: Is it children?

00:03:18.252 --> 00:03:19.419
PETER SZOLOVITS: Yeah, kids.

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:23.590
So I said, hmm, interesting.

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.300
So anyway, if you look
at the statistics,

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:29.820
you see that the mean heart
rate in CareVue is 108,

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:35.050
and the mean heart rate
in MetaVision is 87.

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:39.310
But of course, means
are not that meaningful

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:43.480
when you look at these
bimodal distributions.

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.540
So then I said, well, what
if we just look at adults?

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:54.230
So we look at people from age
greater than 1 up to age 90.

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:56.940
And I'll say a word
about that in a minute.

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:58.840
And I look at those
two distributions.

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.100
They look pretty close.

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.120
They look pretty similar.

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.160
So that means that
the number of patients

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.010
of different ages
in the adult group

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:12.220
is similar in the two data sets.

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:17.290
But if I don't exclude the
very young or the very old,

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:20.200
then I see this
funny distribution

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.840
where I have suppressed
ages greater than 90

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.700
but not the young.

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.890
And what you see is
that in CareVue there's

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:29.080
this giant spike at age 0.

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:37.570
So what happened at the hospital
is that under the old system

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:41.860
it was also being used in the
NICU, the Neonatal Intensive

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:43.110
Care Unit.

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:46.750
And the new system was not
being used in the NICU.

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:52.090
And therefore, they didn't
capture data about babies.

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:57.100
And in fact, if you
look at age versus heart

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:00.520
rate of the entire
population, you

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.200
see two very peculiar things.

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:07.120
So here are the adults that
we've been talking about,

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:08.290
and here are the babies.

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:11.080
And sure enough, they
have higher heart rates.

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.892
And then here are these
300-year-old people.

00:05:13.892 --> 00:05:15.040
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.460
You go, wow, I don't think I'm
going to have a heart rate when

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:21.000
I'm 300 years old.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.020
So who are those people?

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:28.960
Anybody have a clue?

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:29.612
Yeah?

00:05:29.612 --> 00:05:30.940
AUDIENCE: Entry errors.

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:31.898
PETER SZOLOVITS: Sorry?

00:05:31.898 --> 00:05:34.107
AUDIENCE: Entry errors?

00:05:34.107 --> 00:05:35.940
PETER SZOLOVITS: There
are too many of them.

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:38.890
Yeah, entry errors is
always a possibility,

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:41.470
but there's quite a
few data points there.

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:42.176
Yeah?

00:05:42.176 --> 00:05:45.582
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:45.582 --> 00:05:46.540
PETER SZOLOVITS: Close.

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:48.460
It's not quite missing data.

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:52.150
So HIPAA, the Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:56.620
Act, defines a set of
criteria about protecting

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:58.850
personal health information.

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:01.540
And one of the things
you are not allowed to do

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:04.270
is to specify the
age of somebody

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:07.600
who is 90 years old or older.

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:11.200
And the reason is because
the number of 97-year-olds

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:12.800
is pretty small.

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:16.420
And so if I tell you that
Willy is 97 years old,

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:19.120
then you're going to be able
to pick him out of a population

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:24.640
relatively easily, and so
it's prohibited to say that.

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:28.150
So as a result, everybody
who's 90 or older

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:32.350
gets labeled as being 300
years old in the database.

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:34.840
It's an artifact.

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:41.770
It's like back in my youth, I
worked as a computer programmer

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:45.370
at a health sciences
computing facility at UCLA.

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:49.390
And we used to have a
convention that missing data was

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:53.272
represented by 99999.

00:06:53.272 --> 00:06:57.640
And of course, if you average
that into a real data set,

00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:01.720
you get garbage, which
people did regularly.

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:03.850
So there are problems
with this, and we're

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:05.530
running into one of those.

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:11.050
If you look at just the
adults, the two systems

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:12.620
actually look very similar.

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:16.150
So the blue and red
dots, or the two systems,

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:19.180
and I've drawn the trend
lines between them,

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:21.680
and you can see that
they're very similar.

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:23.720
So it looks like
as you get older,

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:27.130
your heart rate
declines very slightly.

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:29.890
But it does so equally
in the two data sets.

00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:30.390
Yeah?

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:32.330
AUDIENCE: On the previous
slide, beyond 300,

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:35.320
it looks like they're
older than 300?

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:37.600
PETER SZOLOVITS: Well that's
because the ages there

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:41.120
are computed at the time that
the heart rate is measured.

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:44.170
And so if you are
300 years old when

00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:46.420
you're admitted to
the hospital, if you

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:48.910
stay in the hospital
for six months,

00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:51.220
then you're 300
and 1/2 years old

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:52.595
by the time of that measurement.

00:07:52.595 --> 00:07:55.150
[LAUGHS] So that's why
there are data points

00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:58.000
to the right of 300.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.240
Yeah, good catch.

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:03.580
OK, and then this is what
the babies look like.

00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:06.730
And of course, they do
have higher heart rates.

00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:08.500
And here here are the oldsters.

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:13.600
So actually, there are
people out to 310 years

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:18.430
old because maybe they were
discharged from the hospital.

00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:21.410
And then at age
100, they came back.

00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:23.320
You know, maybe they
were 90 years old

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:26.540
at the time they were initially
admitted 10 years later.

00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:29.650
They came back, and we
recorded more data about them,

00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:33.600
and so this is all
relative to that 300.

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:35.679
OK, so that's just one example.

00:08:35.679 --> 00:08:38.799
And the lesson
there is be careful

00:08:38.799 --> 00:08:42.070
when you look at data because
it can really easily fool

00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:45.850
you 'cause there are all kinds
of funny things about the way

00:08:45.850 --> 00:08:49.360
it's collected, about
these artifactual things

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:54.370
like 300-year-old
patients and so on.

00:08:54.370 --> 00:08:57.100
So here's a catalog
of the types of data

00:08:57.100 --> 00:08:59.330
that are available to us.

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:03.400
So we have the typical kind of
electronic health record data

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:05.110
from hospitals--

00:09:05.110 --> 00:09:09.010
demographics, age, sex,
socioeconomic status,

00:09:09.010 --> 00:09:11.740
insurance type, language,
religion, living situation,

00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:15.700
family structure,
location, work, et cetera.

00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:17.020
We have vital signs--

00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:19.840
your weight, your height,
your pulse, respiration rate,

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:22.430
body temperature, et cetera.

00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:24.070
So these are
typically the things

00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:27.040
that if you ever go
to a doctor's office,

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:29.860
or you go into a
hospital, the nurse

00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:33.130
will take you aside and weigh
you and measure your height

00:09:33.130 --> 00:09:37.930
and check your blood pressure
and take your temperature

00:09:37.930 --> 00:09:38.890
and stuff like that.

00:09:38.890 --> 00:09:41.380
These are standard
vital signs, and so we

00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:44.380
have lots of those recorded.

00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:47.920
Medications--
prescription medications,

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:50.420
over-the-counter
drugs, illegal drugs

00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:52.660
if you're willing not to
lie to your health care

00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:56.050
provider, alcohol.

00:09:56.050 --> 00:09:58.870
Again, one of my
earliest days, I

00:09:58.870 --> 00:10:03.010
was hanging out with a
cardiologist at Tufts Medical

00:10:03.010 --> 00:10:06.700
Center, and we see
this elderly lady

00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:11.140
who looks kind of terrible.

00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:13.060
And we're talking to her--

00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:14.860
well, the doctor
is talking to her.

00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:18.300
I'm trying to stay
out of the way.

00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:24.430
And he says, so do
you drink alcohol?

00:10:24.430 --> 00:10:27.760
And she says, oh, no,
never touch the stuff.

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:30.740
And then we talk some
more, and we go out

00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:32.440
of the patient's room.

00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:38.360
And the doctor turns to me
out of earshot of the patient

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:41.540
and says, oh, she's
a chronic drunk.

00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:43.400
I said, well, how do you know?

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:45.710
And he says, well,
from lab tests,

00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:49.760
from the appearance of her
skin, from her general demeanor,

00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:53.750
from various sort of
ineffable factors.

00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:57.200
And so patients lie.

00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:59.750
They really do because they
don't want to tell you things.

00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:05.250
Medications, by the
way, is a big deal.

00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:09.350
So there is this whole field
called med red, medication

00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:14.240
reconciliation, which is the
hospitals or the doctors'

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:17.600
offices attempt to figure
out what medications

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:19.440
you're actually taking.

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:21.800
So I'm a member of
the MIT health plan,

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:25.070
and if I sign into my
health plan account,

00:11:25.070 --> 00:11:29.270
it tells me that I'm
taking some pills that I

00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:36.320
got 12 years ago as part
of a laboratory test,

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:39.500
where I took two pills
which were supposed

00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:41.390
to have some
physiological effect,

00:11:41.390 --> 00:11:43.070
and then they measured that.

00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:44.990
And I've never
gotten another pill

00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:47.900
and never taken one
since then, nor would it

00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:50.270
be particularly good for me.

00:11:50.270 --> 00:11:52.670
But it's still on my
record, and there's

00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:56.720
no notice of it ever
having been discontinued.

00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:59.090
And that's a real
problem because if you're

00:11:59.090 --> 00:12:01.250
taking care of a
patient, you'd like

00:12:01.250 --> 00:12:04.030
to understand what drugs
they're actually taking,

00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:07.760
and it's hard to know.

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:10.490
Then lab tests-- so
this is the things

00:12:10.490 --> 00:12:14.810
that you imagine
that we do a lot of,

00:12:14.810 --> 00:12:18.530
and these are components of
the blood and the urine mainly,

00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:23.540
but also of the stool, saliva,
spinal fluid, fluid taken off

00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:28.010
the belly, joint fluid,
bone marrow, stuff

00:12:28.010 --> 00:12:30.030
coming out of your lungs.

00:12:30.030 --> 00:12:33.290
It's anything and
any place where

00:12:33.290 --> 00:12:36.800
you can produce
some specimen, they

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:39.380
can send it to a lab and
measure things in it,

00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:42.600
and they measure lots and lots
of different kinds of things.

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:44.660
And these are often useful.

00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:48.740
Pathology, qualitative and
quantitative examination

00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:51.830
of any body tissue, for
example, biopsy samples

00:12:51.830 --> 00:12:55.340
or surgical scraps.

00:12:55.340 --> 00:12:57.290
You know, if they
do an operation,

00:12:57.290 --> 00:12:59.960
they cut something out
of you, that typically

00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:01.765
winds up on a
pathologist's bench,

00:13:01.765 --> 00:13:05.230
who then tries to figure out
what its characteristics are

00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:09.590
and that's, again,
useful information.

00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:13.310
Microbiology--
ever since Pasteur,

00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:16.580
we know that organisms
cause disease.

00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:21.950
And so we're quite interested
in knowing what organisms

00:13:21.950 --> 00:13:23.750
are growing inside your body.

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:30.770
And typically, testing is not
only to identify the organism

00:13:30.770 --> 00:13:33.140
but also to figure
out which antibiotics

00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:36.260
it's sensitive to
and insensitive to.

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:41.900
And so you'll see things like
reports of sensitivity testing

00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:44.270
at various dilutions.

00:13:44.270 --> 00:13:47.300
In other words, they try
to give a strong dose

00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:49.870
of an antibiotic a
week weaker dose a week

00:13:49.870 --> 00:13:52.250
or dose a weaker
dose a week or dose

00:13:52.250 --> 00:13:55.550
to see which is the
minimum level of dosing

00:13:55.550 --> 00:13:58.220
that's enough to
kill the bacteria.

00:13:58.220 --> 00:14:01.580
There's a comma missing there,
but input, output of fluids

00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:06.380
is another important thing
because people, especially

00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:10.940
in the hospital, often get
either dehydrated or over

00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:11.990
hydrated.

00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:13.790
And neither of those
is good for you,

00:14:13.790 --> 00:14:16.940
and so trying to keep track
of what's going into you

00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:20.990
and what's coming out
of you is important.

00:14:20.990 --> 00:14:22.740
Then there are tons of notes.

00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:26.960
So an important one that we're
going to look at in this class

00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:28.700
is discharge summaries.

00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:31.640
So these are the
typically long notes

00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:35.390
that are written at the
end of a hospitalization.

00:14:35.390 --> 00:14:41.570
So this is a summary of why you
came in, what they did to you,

00:14:41.570 --> 00:14:45.410
the main things they
discovered about you,

00:14:45.410 --> 00:14:48.470
and then plans for what to
do after your discharge.

00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:50.340
Where are you going to go?

00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:52.250
What drugs are you
going to be taking?

00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:55.650
When are you supposed to come
back for follow up, et cetera.

00:14:55.650 --> 00:14:58.850
I'll show you an excruciatingly
long one of those

00:14:58.850 --> 00:15:01.650
later in the lecture today.

00:15:01.650 --> 00:15:04.760
But we also have notes from
attendings and/or residents,

00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:08.990
nurses, various
specialties, consultants.

00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:11.390
The referring physician--
if somebody sends you

00:15:11.390 --> 00:15:14.360
to the hospital, that
doctor will usually

00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:17.310
write a note saying this
is what I'm interested in.

00:15:17.310 --> 00:15:20.110
Here's why I'm sending
in the patient.

00:15:20.110 --> 00:15:24.090
There are letters back to the
referring physician saying, OK,

00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:25.460
this is what we found out.

00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:28.810
Here's the answer to the
question you were asking.

00:15:28.810 --> 00:15:30.820
There are emergency
department notes.

00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:34.450
So that's often the first
contact between the patient

00:15:34.450 --> 00:15:36.410
and the health care system.

00:15:36.410 --> 00:15:38.620
So these are all important.

00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:43.300
And then there's tons
and tons of billing data.

00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:48.610
So remember the EHR
systems were initially

00:15:48.610 --> 00:15:51.550
designed by accountants.

00:15:51.550 --> 00:15:54.520
And they were designed for
the purpose of billing.

00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:58.810
And so we capture a lot of
data about formalized ways

00:15:58.810 --> 00:16:01.730
of describing the
condition of the patient

00:16:01.730 --> 00:16:04.540
and what was done to
the patient in order

00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:07.720
to submit the right bills.

00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:12.320
You obviously want to bill
through it as much as possible.

00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:14.830
But you have to be able to
justify the bills that you

00:16:14.830 --> 00:16:18.610
submit because insurance
companies and Medicare

00:16:18.610 --> 00:16:23.112
and Medicaid don't have
a good sense of humor.

00:16:23.112 --> 00:16:27.040
And if you submit bills for
things that you can't justify,

00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:28.180
then you get penalized.

00:16:31.690 --> 00:16:33.610
And then there are
administrative data

00:16:33.610 --> 00:16:36.100
like, which service are you on?

00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:40.300
So this this is occasionally
a confusing thing.

00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:43.990
You can go into the hospital
and have heart problems,

00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:46.750
but it turns out that
the heart intensive care

00:16:46.750 --> 00:16:51.400
unit, the cardiac intensive care
unit, is full up with patients.

00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:56.110
But there's an extra bed in the
pulmonary intensive care unit,

00:16:56.110 --> 00:16:58.790
and so they stick
you in that unit,

00:16:58.790 --> 00:17:01.300
but you're still on
the cardiology service.

00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:05.140
And so there are these sort of
mixture kinds of cases that you

00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:06.700
still have to take care of.

00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:09.579
Transfers are when you get
transferred from one place

00:17:09.579 --> 00:17:13.119
to another in the hospital.

00:17:13.119 --> 00:17:17.890
Imaging data-- so I'm not going
to talk about that much today,

00:17:17.890 --> 00:17:23.410
but there are X-rays,
ultrasound, CT, MRI, PET scans,

00:17:23.410 --> 00:17:27.760
retinal scans, endoscopy,
photographs of your skin

00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:28.790
and stuff like that.

00:17:28.790 --> 00:17:31.750
So this is all imaging
data, and there's

00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:33.550
been a tremendous
amount of progress

00:17:33.550 --> 00:17:35.980
recently in applying
machine learning

00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:39.590
techniques to try to interpret
the contents of these data.

00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:42.590
So these are also
very important.

00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:47.170
And then there's the whole
quantified self movement.

00:17:47.170 --> 00:17:50.185
I mean, how many of you
where an activity tracker?

00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:54.520
Only about 1/3?

00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:56.980
I'm surprised at
a place like MIT.

00:17:56.980 --> 00:17:58.900
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:58.900 --> 00:18:02.740
So you know, we measure
steps and elevation change

00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:03.590
and workouts.

00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:08.140
And you can record
vital signs and diet

00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:12.040
and your blood sugar,
especially if you're diabetic;

00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:16.710
allergies, allergic incidents.

00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:20.380
There's all this mindfulness,
mood, sleep, pain,

00:18:20.380 --> 00:18:22.180
sexual activity.

00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:24.520
And then people have
developed this idea

00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:27.340
of N of 1 experiments.

00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:29.800
For example, I had
a student some years

00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:33.490
ago who suffered from psoriasis.

00:18:33.490 --> 00:18:36.730
It's a grody
condition of the skin.

00:18:36.730 --> 00:18:39.160
And the problem is there
are no good cures for it.

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:42.130
And so people who
suffer from psoriasis

00:18:42.130 --> 00:18:43.750
try all kinds of things.

00:18:43.750 --> 00:18:46.210
You know, they stop
eating nonce for a while,

00:18:46.210 --> 00:18:49.120
or they douse
themselves with vinegar.

00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:54.040
Or they do whatever crazy
thing comes to mind.

00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:57.970
And we don't have a good theory
for how to treat this disease.

00:18:57.970 --> 00:19:01.280
But on the other hand, some
things work for some people.

00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:03.460
And so there's a
whole methodology that

00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:06.820
has been developed that says,
when you try these things,

00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:08.770
act like a scientist.

00:19:08.770 --> 00:19:10.360
Have hypotheses.

00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:11.320
Take good notes.

00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:14.380
Collect good data.

00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:18.040
Be cognizant of things
like onset periods, where

00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:21.190
you know you may have to drip
vinegar on yourself for a week

00:19:21.190 --> 00:19:23.270
before you see any effect.

00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:26.890
So if that doesn't do a thing
after one day, don't stop.

00:19:26.890 --> 00:19:31.510
And furthermore, if you stop
then don't start something new

00:19:31.510 --> 00:19:35.470
immediately because
you will then

00:19:35.470 --> 00:19:39.010
be confused about whether this
is the effect of the thing

00:19:39.010 --> 00:19:42.250
you were on before or the
new thing that you're trying.

00:19:42.250 --> 00:19:46.480
So there's all sorts
of ideas like that.

00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:50.740
So this is a slide from
our paper on MIMIC-III.

00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:54.370
And it gives you a kind
of overview of what's

00:19:54.370 --> 00:19:56.390
going on with the patient.

00:19:56.390 --> 00:19:59.210
So if you look at this--

00:19:59.210 --> 00:20:01.570
I'm going to point
with my hands--

00:20:01.570 --> 00:20:04.150
at the top is something
very important.

00:20:04.150 --> 00:20:07.640
This patient starts
off at full code.

00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:11.390
That means that if something
bad happens to him,

00:20:11.390 --> 00:20:15.340
he wants everything to be
done to try to save him.

00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:17.470
And he winds up in
comfort measures

00:20:17.470 --> 00:20:21.110
only, which means that if
something bad happens to him,

00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:23.350
he wants to die--

00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:28.360
or his family does
if he's unconscious.

00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:30.560
So what else do we
know about this guy?

00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:34.730
Well GCS is the
Glasgow Coma Score.

00:20:34.730 --> 00:20:38.090
And it's a way of
quantifying people's level

00:20:38.090 --> 00:20:39.620
of consciousness.

00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:43.310
And you see that
at the beginning

00:20:43.310 --> 00:20:47.120
this patient is oriented,
and then gets confused.

00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:51.410
And finally, is only making
incomprehensible words

00:20:51.410 --> 00:20:53.980
or sounds.

00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:57.590
Motor, he's able
to obey commands.

00:20:57.590 --> 00:21:01.610
Eventually, he's
only able to flex

00:21:01.610 --> 00:21:03.560
when you stimulate his muscles.

00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:06.970
So he's no longer conscious.

00:21:06.970 --> 00:21:11.900
Eye movements-- he's able
to follow you spontaneously.

00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:14.000
He's able to orient to speech.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.200
And eventually
orientation at all.

00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:20.700
So this is clearly somebody
who's going downhill quickly

00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:25.160
and, in fact, dies at
the end of this episode.

00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:28.220
Now, we then look
at labs so we can

00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:32.240
see what is their level of
platelets at about the time

00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:35.000
that they're measured,
their creatinine level,

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:38.970
their white blood cell count,
the neutrophils percentage, et

00:21:38.970 --> 00:21:40.220
cetera.

00:21:40.220 --> 00:21:44.450
And there's not every possible
data point on the slide.

00:21:44.450 --> 00:21:47.150
This is just illustrative.

00:21:47.150 --> 00:21:49.590
The next section is medications.

00:21:49.590 --> 00:21:51.920
So the person is on morphine.

00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:55.330
They're on Vancomycin,
which is an antibiotic.

00:21:55.330 --> 00:21:57.440
Piperacillin-- I don't
know what that is.

00:21:57.440 --> 00:21:58.842
Does somebody know?

00:21:58.842 --> 00:22:00.288
AUDIENCE: Antibiotic.

00:22:00.288 --> 00:22:01.463
PETER SZOLOVITS: It's what?

00:22:01.463 --> 00:22:02.822
AUDIENCE: It's antibiotic.

00:22:02.822 --> 00:22:05.090
PETER SZOLOVITS: OK.

00:22:05.090 --> 00:22:09.210
Sodium chloride 9%, So that's
just keeping him hydrated.

00:22:09.210 --> 00:22:11.310
Amiodarone and dextrose.

00:22:11.310 --> 00:22:14.480
So dextrose is giving
him some energy.

00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:18.030
And then these are the
various measurements.

00:22:18.030 --> 00:22:22.010
So you see the heart rate,
for example, is up pretty high

00:22:22.010 --> 00:22:24.290
and is going up near the end.

00:22:24.290 --> 00:22:28.310
The oxygen saturation
starts off pretty good.

00:22:28.310 --> 00:22:33.540
But here we're
down to 60% or 50%

00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:37.640
O2 sat, which is supposed
to be above about 92

00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:40.100
in order to be
considered reasonable.

00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:42.770
So again, this is a
very consistent picture

00:22:42.770 --> 00:22:48.300
of things going very badly wrong
for this particular patient.

00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:52.080
So this is all the
data in the database.

00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:54.680
Now, if you want to try to
analyze some of this stuff,

00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:59.450
you can say, well,
let's look at the ages

00:22:59.450 --> 00:23:03.360
at the time of the last lab
measurement in the database.

00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:06.330
So we have the times of
all the lab measurements.

00:23:06.330 --> 00:23:13.580
So we can see that many of the
ICU population are fairly old.

00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:18.120
There's a relatively small
number of young people

00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:22.610
and then a growing number of
older people in both females

00:23:22.610 --> 00:23:24.140
and males.

00:23:24.140 --> 00:23:29.430
If we look at age at
admission by gender--

00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:32.870
so this is age at admission not
age at the time the last lab

00:23:32.870 --> 00:23:35.060
measurement was done--

00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:37.160
it's a pretty similar curve.

00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:42.800
So we see that
females were 64.21

00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:51.470
at time of last lab measurement;
63.5 at the time of admission.

00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:55.580
So we can look at demographics,
and demographics typically

00:23:55.580 --> 00:24:00.560
includes these kinds of factors,
which I've mentioned before.

00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:02.900
And again, if we're
interested in the relationship

00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:06.960
between this and, for
example, the age distribution,

00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:12.860
we see that if you look at the
different admission types--

00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:18.260
so you can be either
admitted for an emergency

00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:22.670
for some urgent
care or electively.

00:24:22.670 --> 00:24:25.850
And it doesn't seem to make
a whole lot of difference,

00:24:25.850 --> 00:24:31.260
at least in the means of the
population age distribution.

00:24:31.260 --> 00:24:35.390
On the other hand, if you
look at insurance type

00:24:35.390 --> 00:24:38.320
and, say, who's
paying the bills,

00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:42.190
there is a big difference
in the age distributions.

00:24:42.190 --> 00:24:48.710
Now, why do you think that
private insurance drops way off

00:24:48.710 --> 00:24:51.331
at about 65?

00:24:51.331 --> 00:24:54.000
AUDIENCE: Isn't insurance
always covered for everyone

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.110
by the state health?

00:24:56.110 --> 00:24:57.860
PETER SZOLOVITS: It's
because of Medicare.

00:24:57.860 --> 00:25:02.450
So Medicare covers people
who are 65 years old.

00:25:02.450 --> 00:25:04.370
There's a terrible story
I have to tell you.

00:25:04.370 --> 00:25:07.430
I was talking to somebody at
an insurance company who's

00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:10.370
a bit cynical, and
he said suppose

00:25:10.370 --> 00:25:14.150
that you see a 63-year-old
patient who's developing type

00:25:14.150 --> 00:25:16.100
2 diabetes, what
should you do for him?

00:25:19.210 --> 00:25:21.180
Well, there are
standard things you

00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:23.130
should do for
somebody developing

00:25:23.130 --> 00:25:26.730
type 2 diabetes, like get
him to eat better, get

00:25:26.730 --> 00:25:29.040
him to lose weight, get
him to exercise more,

00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:31.000
et cetera, et cetera.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:33.570
But his cynical answer
was absolutely nothing.

00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:37.180
Why?

00:25:37.180 --> 00:25:40.330
Well it's very
cheap to do nothing.

00:25:40.330 --> 00:25:42.760
Most people who
develop type 2 diabetes

00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:46.670
don't get real sick
in the next two years.

00:25:46.670 --> 00:25:49.630
And by the time
this patient is 65,

00:25:49.630 --> 00:25:51.670
he'll be the government's
responsibility,

00:25:51.670 --> 00:25:55.440
not the insurance company's.

00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:56.977
Nice.

00:25:56.977 --> 00:25:57.602
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:26:01.107 --> 00:26:03.190
PETER SZOLOVITS: So of
course a lot of the elderly

00:26:03.190 --> 00:26:07.840
are insured by Medicare or
Medicaid, not that surprising.

00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:10.810
Self-pay is a
pretty small number

00:26:10.810 --> 00:26:14.030
because it's insanely expensive
to pay for your own health

00:26:14.030 --> 00:26:16.810
care.

00:26:16.810 --> 00:26:18.250
What about where you came from?

00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:25.330
Were you referred
from a clinic, or were

00:26:25.330 --> 00:26:27.070
you an emergency room admit?

00:26:27.070 --> 00:26:32.530
Or were you referred
from an HMO or et cetera?

00:26:32.530 --> 00:26:38.170
And other than a transfer from
a skilled nursing facility

00:26:38.170 --> 00:26:42.490
or transfer within the
facility, within the hospital,

00:26:42.490 --> 00:26:44.200
it doesn't make much difference.

00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:47.350
The averages there
and the distributions

00:26:47.350 --> 00:26:50.290
look moderately similar.

00:26:50.290 --> 00:26:53.440
If you're coming from a
skilled nursing facility,

00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:56.290
if you are in a skilled
nursing facility,

00:26:56.290 --> 00:27:00.600
you're probably old because
younger people don't typically

00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:02.560
need skilled nursing care.

00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:06.490
And I'm not sure why
transfers within the facility

00:27:06.490 --> 00:27:10.780
are significantly
younger ages, but that's

00:27:10.780 --> 00:27:13.060
true from the MIMIC data.

00:27:15.610 --> 00:27:18.730
What about age at
admission by language?

00:27:18.730 --> 00:27:20.950
So some people speak English.

00:27:20.950 --> 00:27:25.180
Some people speak not available.

00:27:25.180 --> 00:27:28.490
Some people speak
Spanish, et cetera.

00:27:28.490 --> 00:27:30.970
So it turns out the
Russians are the oldest.

00:27:33.610 --> 00:27:36.550
And that may have to do
with immigration patterns,

00:27:36.550 --> 00:27:38.520
or I don't know exactly why.

00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:45.700
But that's what the data show.

00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:49.120
If you do it by
ethnicity, it turns out

00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:53.590
that African-Americans,
on the whole,

00:27:53.590 --> 00:27:56.080
are somewhat
younger than whites.

00:27:56.080 --> 00:27:58.510
And Hispanics are
somewhat younger yet.

00:28:01.300 --> 00:28:06.520
So that means that those
subpopulations apparently

00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:11.680
need intensive care earlier
in life than whites.

00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:15.670
So this is a topic that's
very hot right now,

00:28:15.670 --> 00:28:20.250
discussions about how bias
might play into health care.

00:28:20.250 --> 00:28:20.864
Yeah?

00:28:20.864 --> 00:28:23.770
AUDIENCE: What does
unable to obtain mean?

00:28:23.770 --> 00:28:25.690
PETER SZOLOVITS: It
just means that somebody

00:28:25.690 --> 00:28:28.000
refused to say what
their ethnicity was.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:29.540
AUDIENCE: When they
were asked this?

00:28:29.540 --> 00:28:30.910
PETER SZOLOVITS: Yeah.

00:28:30.910 --> 00:28:31.750
I think.

00:28:31.750 --> 00:28:34.150
I'm not positive.

00:28:34.150 --> 00:28:36.610
AUDIENCE: So just to confirm.

00:28:36.610 --> 00:28:40.722
This also represents Boston's
population dynamics too, right?

00:28:40.722 --> 00:28:42.430
PETER SZOLOVITS: It's
the catchment basin

00:28:42.430 --> 00:28:44.530
of the Beth Israel
Deaconess Hospital,

00:28:44.530 --> 00:28:47.020
which is Boston clearly.

00:28:47.020 --> 00:28:51.940
But there are-- it turns out
that a lot of North Shore

00:28:51.940 --> 00:28:56.140
people go to Mass General, and
so different hospitals have

00:28:56.140 --> 00:28:57.328
different catchment basins.

00:28:57.328 --> 00:28:59.870
AUDIENCE: Does it have anything
to do with like, is this just

00:28:59.870 --> 00:29:00.640
the ICU?

00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:04.820
Or is this everybody who goes
to the hospital or the ER?

00:29:04.820 --> 00:29:07.270
PETER SZOLOVITS: These are
all people who at some point

00:29:07.270 --> 00:29:10.040
were in the ICU.

00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:12.580
So these are the
sicker patients.

00:29:12.580 --> 00:29:13.690
Yeah?

00:29:13.690 --> 00:29:15.630
AUDIENCE: So just
want to double-check

00:29:15.630 --> 00:29:18.172
there's a higher proportion of
black, African American people

00:29:18.172 --> 00:29:21.539
in the population here as
well because the red is

00:29:21.539 --> 00:29:23.950
higher than the others?

00:29:23.950 --> 00:29:26.230
PETER SZOLOVITS: No, actually--

00:29:26.230 --> 00:29:27.970
I don't remember if
I have that graph--

00:29:27.970 --> 00:29:29.883
I think this is cumulative.

00:29:29.883 --> 00:29:31.570
AUDIENCE: Oh, OK.

00:29:31.570 --> 00:29:35.530
PETER SZOLOVITS:
So most people are

00:29:35.530 --> 00:29:41.680
white for whatever definition
of white we're using.

00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:44.680
And I think it's only the
increment that you see on top.

00:29:49.450 --> 00:29:50.950
All right, how about
marital status?

00:29:53.490 --> 00:29:55.740
Well, according to this,
it's bad to be single.

00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:06.130
So I could sort of see
that for hospitalization.

00:30:06.130 --> 00:30:09.580
I'm not sure why
it's true for the ICU

00:30:09.580 --> 00:30:13.870
because if you don't have
anybody at home to take care

00:30:13.870 --> 00:30:16.780
of you when you get
sick, it seems reasonable

00:30:16.780 --> 00:30:19.150
that you'd be more likely
to wind up in the hospital.

00:30:19.150 --> 00:30:21.480
But I don't know why you'd
wind up in intensive care.

00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:22.080
Yeah?

00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:24.790
AUDIENCE: Isn't it possible
that those are also

00:30:24.790 --> 00:30:28.510
single people are probably
younger than married people,

00:30:28.510 --> 00:30:30.130
and those are probably
younger than--

00:30:30.130 --> 00:30:30.790
PETER SZOLOVITS: Yes, yeah.

00:30:30.790 --> 00:30:31.450
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] people.

00:30:31.450 --> 00:30:33.533
PETER SZOLOVITS: Yeah,
that's probably also right.

00:30:39.330 --> 00:30:41.610
So here's an
interesting question,

00:30:41.610 --> 00:30:43.380
a little bit related
to something you'll

00:30:43.380 --> 00:30:46.800
see on the next problem set.

00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:50.520
So could we predict
in-hospital mortality

00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:52.305
from just these
demographic features?

00:30:56.100 --> 00:31:00.120
So I'm using a tool
in language called

00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:02.940
R. This is a general
linear model,

00:31:02.940 --> 00:31:06.540
and I've set it up to do
basically logistic regression.

00:31:06.540 --> 00:31:09.180
And it says I'm
predicting whether you

00:31:09.180 --> 00:31:16.920
die in the hospital based on
these demographic factors.

00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:19.710
And it turns out that
the only ones that

00:31:19.710 --> 00:31:23.940
are highly significant are age.

00:31:23.940 --> 00:31:27.300
So that's not surprising,
that older people

00:31:27.300 --> 00:31:29.940
are more likely to die
than younger people.

00:31:29.940 --> 00:31:32.100
It's generally true.

00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:36.210
And if I'm unable to
obtain your ethnicity,

00:31:36.210 --> 00:31:42.540
or I don't know your ethnicity,
then you're more likely to die.

00:31:42.540 --> 00:31:46.980
I have no clue why
that might be the case.

00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:49.810
And other things are
not as significant.

00:31:49.810 --> 00:31:52.170
So if you speak
Spanish or English,

00:31:52.170 --> 00:31:54.180
you're slightly
less likely to die.

00:31:54.180 --> 00:31:56.970
You see a negative
contribution here.

00:31:56.970 --> 00:32:01.560
And if you speak Russian, you're
slightly less likely to die.

00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:06.030
But it's significant not
at the p equal 0.05 level,

00:32:06.030 --> 00:32:10.170
but it is at the p
equal 0.06 level.

00:32:10.170 --> 00:32:13.260
And marriage doesn't seem
to make much difference

00:32:13.260 --> 00:32:17.190
in predicting whether
you're going to die or not.

00:32:17.190 --> 00:32:20.770
Now, remember, this
is ICU patients.

00:32:20.770 --> 00:32:24.570
And we're looking at
in-hospital mortality.

00:32:24.570 --> 00:32:26.607
AUDIENCE: For
ethnicity, can they

00:32:26.607 --> 00:32:28.190
learn that at any
point in this study,

00:32:28.190 --> 00:32:29.482
or just right at the beginning?

00:32:29.482 --> 00:32:30.445
Or do you know?

00:32:30.445 --> 00:32:31.320
Because I don't know.

00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:32.340
PROFESSOR: I don't know.

00:32:32.340 --> 00:32:34.170
AUDIENCE: Because
it could be that

00:32:34.170 --> 00:32:37.880
unable to obtain means that they
died before we can ask them.

00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:39.630
PROFESSOR: No,
because there wouldn't

00:32:39.630 --> 00:32:44.040
be that many of those
people, I think.

00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:46.260
There are not that
many people who don't

00:32:46.260 --> 00:32:51.300
live past the intake interview.

00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:52.290
And they do ask them.

00:32:55.350 --> 00:32:58.420
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:58.420 --> 00:33:00.560
PROFESSOR: Yeah, that
would be an example.

00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:05.860
But I don't think you'd see
enough such people to show up

00:33:05.860 --> 00:33:08.800
statistically.

00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:11.410
OK.

00:33:11.410 --> 00:33:14.720
Well, so I've already
mentioned that there

00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:18.180
is this problem of having
moved from CareVue view

00:33:18.180 --> 00:33:21.590
to MetaVision just in
the MIMIC database.

00:33:21.590 --> 00:33:23.890
But of course, this is
a much bigger problem

00:33:23.890 --> 00:33:25.720
around the country
and around the world,

00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:29.890
because every hospital has its
own way of keeping records.

00:33:29.890 --> 00:33:34.180
And wouldn't it be nice
if we had standards?

00:33:34.180 --> 00:33:36.310
And of course, there's
this funny phrase,

00:33:36.310 --> 00:33:38.470
the wonderful thing
about standards

00:33:38.470 --> 00:33:41.530
is that there's so
many to choose from.

00:33:41.530 --> 00:33:44.770
So for example, if you look
at prescriptions in the MIMIC

00:33:44.770 --> 00:33:49.280
database, here are two
particular prescriptions

00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:53.800
for subject number
57139 admitted

00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:58.690
on admission ID 155470.

00:33:58.690 --> 00:34:03.310
And so they have the same start
date but different end dates.

00:34:03.310 --> 00:34:08.199
One is a prescription for
Tylenol, acetaminophen,

00:34:08.199 --> 00:34:13.469
and the other is for clobetasol
propionate 0.05% cream.

00:34:13.469 --> 00:34:16.960
That's a skin lotion thing for--

00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:20.530
I think it's a
steroid skin cream.

00:34:20.530 --> 00:34:23.710
So if you look in
the BI's database,

00:34:23.710 --> 00:34:26.170
they have their own
private formulary

00:34:26.170 --> 00:34:32.679
code where this thing is
acet325 and this thing

00:34:32.679 --> 00:34:38.380
is clob.05C30, right?

00:34:38.380 --> 00:34:40.300
And if you look,
there there's also

00:34:40.300 --> 00:34:45.520
something called a GSN, which
is some commercial coding

00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:47.590
system for drugs.

00:34:47.590 --> 00:34:51.219
Maybe having to do with
who their drug supplier is

00:34:51.219 --> 00:34:53.090
at the hospital.

00:34:53.090 --> 00:34:55.310
And these have different codes.

00:34:55.310 --> 00:35:01.090
There's the National Drug Code,
which is an FDA assigned nine

00:35:01.090 --> 00:35:06.280
digit code that specifies who
made the drug, what form it's

00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:09.670
in, and what's its strength.

00:35:09.670 --> 00:35:11.650
And so you get these.

00:35:11.650 --> 00:35:14.890
Then there's a human
readable description

00:35:14.890 --> 00:35:20.450
that says Tylenol comes
in 325 milligram tablets.

00:35:20.450 --> 00:35:24.640
And the clobetasol
comes in 30 gram tubes.

00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:31.030
And the dose is supposed
to be 325 to 650, i.e. one

00:35:31.030 --> 00:35:34.510
to two tablets
measured in milligrams.

00:35:34.510 --> 00:35:40.270
The dose here is one
application, whatever that is.

00:35:40.270 --> 00:35:42.640
I don't know what
the 0.01 means.

00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:45.370
And this is a tablet
and that's a tube.

00:35:45.370 --> 00:35:47.260
And this is taken orally.

00:35:47.260 --> 00:35:51.970
That's administered
on the skin, right?

00:35:51.970 --> 00:35:55.230
So this is a local database.

00:35:55.230 --> 00:36:00.490
AUDIENCE: For a doctor,
they just [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:00.490 --> 00:36:03.250
PROFESSOR: At most
hospitals, that's true now.

00:36:03.250 --> 00:36:05.350
It wasn't true when
the MIMIC database

00:36:05.350 --> 00:36:08.170
started being collected.

00:36:08.170 --> 00:36:12.430
And the BI was
relatively late in moving

00:36:12.430 --> 00:36:15.490
to that compared to some of the
other hospitals in the Boston

00:36:15.490 --> 00:36:16.510
area.

00:36:16.510 --> 00:36:19.720
Each hospital has
its own digitorata

00:36:19.720 --> 00:36:23.100
for what it thinks
is most important.

00:36:23.100 --> 00:36:27.910
And I think the BI just didn't
prioritize it as much as some

00:36:27.910 --> 00:36:31.180
of the other hospitals.

00:36:31.180 --> 00:36:36.950
OK, so then I said, well, if
you look at prescriptions,

00:36:36.950 --> 00:36:38.260
how often are they given?

00:36:38.260 --> 00:36:42.310
So remember, we have
about 60,000 ICU stays.

00:36:42.310 --> 00:36:49.810
And so iso-osmotic dextrose
was given 87,000 times

00:36:49.810 --> 00:36:51.200
to various people.

00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:54.090
Sodium chloride
0.9 percent flush.

00:36:54.090 --> 00:36:56.960
Do you know what that is?

00:36:56.960 --> 00:36:59.360
Have you ever had an IV?

00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:02.000
So periodically,
the nurse comes by

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:04.670
and squirts a little
bit of stuff in the IV

00:37:04.670 --> 00:37:07.130
to make sure that it
hasn't clogged up.

00:37:07.130 --> 00:37:09.920
That's what that is.

00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:12.878
Insulin, SW.

00:37:12.878 --> 00:37:13.420
I don't know.

00:37:13.420 --> 00:37:14.480
Salt water?

00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:16.730
I don't know what SW is.

00:37:16.730 --> 00:37:20.670
Magnesium sulfate,
dextrose five in water.

00:37:20.670 --> 00:37:22.340
Furosimide is a diuretic.

00:37:22.340 --> 00:37:26.030
Potassium chloride
replenishes potassium

00:37:26.030 --> 00:37:29.330
that people are often low on.

00:37:29.330 --> 00:37:36.590
And then you go, so why is
there this D5W and that D5W?

00:37:36.590 --> 00:37:42.080
And that's probably some
data in the system, OK?

00:37:42.080 --> 00:37:46.130
One of them has an NDC
code associated with it

00:37:46.130 --> 00:37:49.680
and the other one doesn't
but probably should.

00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:50.240
Yeah.

00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:52.490
AUDIENCE: I was actually
going to ask, does yours mean

00:37:52.490 --> 00:37:54.155
that they're standard
across hospitals

00:37:54.155 --> 00:37:57.410
or just that we
don't have the data?

00:37:57.410 --> 00:38:02.300
PROFESSOR: The NDC code should
be standard across the country,

00:38:02.300 --> 00:38:05.120
because those are
FDA assigned codes.

00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:08.810
But not every hospital
uses them, OK?

00:38:08.810 --> 00:38:10.880
And for the ones
that say zero, I'm

00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:13.490
not sure why they're
not associated

00:38:13.490 --> 00:38:18.220
with a code in this
hospital's database.

00:38:18.220 --> 00:38:26.990
OK, next most common,
you see normal saline,

00:38:26.990 --> 00:38:29.570
0.9 percent sodium chloride.

00:38:29.570 --> 00:38:32.570
So that was the same stuff
as the flush solution

00:38:32.570 --> 00:38:35.450
but this time not
being used for flush.

00:38:35.450 --> 00:38:38.270
Metoprolol is a beta blocker.

00:38:38.270 --> 00:38:43.760
Here's another insulin this time
with an NDC code, et cetera.

00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:48.410
I love bag and vial, OK?

00:38:48.410 --> 00:38:51.680
So these are not
exactly medications.

00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:57.760
A bag is literally like a baggy
that they put something into,

00:38:57.760 --> 00:38:59.690
and a vial is
literally something

00:38:59.690 --> 00:39:01.700
that they put pills in.

00:39:01.700 --> 00:39:03.590
And why is that in the database?

00:39:03.590 --> 00:39:06.830
Because they get to
charge for it, OK?

00:39:06.830 --> 00:39:08.710
And I don't know
what the charge is,

00:39:08.710 --> 00:39:10.280
but it wouldn't
surprise me if you're

00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:15.870
paying $5 for a plastic
bag to put something in.

00:39:15.870 --> 00:39:21.170
OK, so if we say, well, how
many pharmacy orders are there

00:39:21.170 --> 00:39:26.390
per admission at this hospital,
and the answer is a lot.

00:39:26.390 --> 00:39:28.190
So if you look at--

00:39:28.190 --> 00:39:30.380
it's a very long
tailed distribution,

00:39:30.380 --> 00:39:32.930
goes out to about 2,500.

00:39:32.930 --> 00:39:38.980
But you see, if I blow up just
the numbers up to about 200,

00:39:38.980 --> 00:39:41.690
there's a very large
number of people

00:39:41.690 --> 00:39:50.540
with two prescriptions filled,
and then a fairly declining

00:39:50.540 --> 00:39:52.610
number with more.

00:39:52.610 --> 00:39:54.240
And then it's a very long tail.

00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:58.820
So can you imagine 2,500
things prescribed for you

00:39:58.820 --> 00:40:03.110
during a hospital stay?

00:40:03.110 --> 00:40:05.840
Well, a little more
about standards,

00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:10.490
so NDC is probably the
best of the coding systems.

00:40:10.490 --> 00:40:13.380
And it's developed by the FDA.

00:40:13.380 --> 00:40:16.460
The picture up on
the top right shows

00:40:16.460 --> 00:40:20.870
that the first four digits
are the so-called labeler.

00:40:20.870 --> 00:40:23.660
That's usually the person
who produced the drugs,

00:40:23.660 --> 00:40:26.870
or at least the person
who distributes them.

00:40:26.870 --> 00:40:32.490
The second four digit number
is the form of the drug,

00:40:32.490 --> 00:40:37.910
so whether it's capsules, or
tablets, or liquid, or whatever

00:40:37.910 --> 00:40:39.330
and the dose.

00:40:39.330 --> 00:40:44.630
And then the last two digits
are a package code which

00:40:44.630 --> 00:40:49.080
translates into the total number
of doses that are in a package,

00:40:49.080 --> 00:40:49.580
right?

00:40:49.580 --> 00:40:51.440
So this is a godsend.

00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:54.170
And all of the robotic
pharmacies and so on

00:40:54.170 --> 00:41:00.500
rely on using this kind
of information nowadays.

00:41:00.500 --> 00:41:05.180
Unfortunately, they ran
out of four digit numbers,

00:41:05.180 --> 00:41:07.670
and so there's now a--

00:41:07.670 --> 00:41:11.180
they added an extra digit,
but they didn't do it

00:41:11.180 --> 00:41:13.280
systematically, and
so sometimes they

00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:15.620
added an extra
digit to the labeler

00:41:15.620 --> 00:41:18.180
and sometimes to
the product code.

00:41:18.180 --> 00:41:20.720
And so there is a
nightmare of translations

00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:23.600
between the old codes
and the new codes.

00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:25.790
And you have to have a
code dictionary in order

00:41:25.790 --> 00:41:28.700
to do it properly and so on.

00:41:28.700 --> 00:41:31.730
OK, well, if that
weren't good enough,

00:41:31.730 --> 00:41:35.510
the International Council
for the Harmonization

00:41:35.510 --> 00:41:39.860
of Technical requirements for
Pharmaceuticals for Human Use

00:41:39.860 --> 00:41:42.800
developed another coding
system called MedDRA, which

00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:45.930
is also used in various places.

00:41:45.930 --> 00:41:48.980
And this is an
international standard,

00:41:48.980 --> 00:41:51.750
which is, of course,
incompatible with the NDC.

00:41:56.830 --> 00:42:02.270
CPT is the Common Procedural
Terminology, which we'll

00:42:02.270 --> 00:42:04.040
talk about in a little bit.

00:42:04.040 --> 00:42:06.860
And they have a
subrange of their codes

00:42:06.860 --> 00:42:11.400
which also correspond to
medication administration.

00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:15.980
And so this is yet another way
of coding giving medicines.

00:42:15.980 --> 00:42:23.180
And then the HCPCS
is yet another set

00:42:23.180 --> 00:42:26.360
of codes for specifying
what medicines

00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:29.210
you've given to somebody.

00:42:29.210 --> 00:42:34.820
And then I had mentioned this
GSN number, which apparently

00:42:34.820 --> 00:42:36.890
the Beth Israel uses.

00:42:36.890 --> 00:42:40.130
This as a commercial coding
system from a company

00:42:40.130 --> 00:42:43.400
called First Databank
that is in the business

00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:46.310
of trying to produce standards.

00:42:46.310 --> 00:42:48.380
But in this case,
they're producing

00:42:48.380 --> 00:42:52.280
ones that are pretty redundant
with other existing standards.

00:42:52.280 --> 00:42:55.160
But nevertheless, for
historical reasons,

00:42:55.160 --> 00:42:58.900
or for whatever reasons,
people are using these.

00:42:58.900 --> 00:43:01.400
OK, enough of drugs.

00:43:01.400 --> 00:43:04.950
So what procedures
were done to a patient?

00:43:04.950 --> 00:43:07.880
If you look in MIMIC,
there are three tables.

00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:13.850
There's procedures ICD, which
has ICD-9 codes for about

00:43:13.850 --> 00:43:16.550
a quarter million procedures.

00:43:16.550 --> 00:43:20.290
There's CPT events, which
has about half a million,

00:43:20.290 --> 00:43:27.740
600,000 events that are
coded in the CPT terminology.

00:43:27.740 --> 00:43:32.090
And then MetaVision, the
newer of the two systems,

00:43:32.090 --> 00:43:35.420
has about a quarter
million procedure events

00:43:35.420 --> 00:43:37.770
that are coded in that system.

00:43:37.770 --> 00:43:43.280
So some examples, here's the
most common ICD-9 procedure

00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:44.300
codes.

00:43:44.300 --> 00:43:52.700
So ICD-9 code 3893 of which
there are 14,000 instances

00:43:52.700 --> 00:43:57.410
is venous catheterization,
not elsewhere classified.

00:43:57.410 --> 00:44:00.710
So what's venous
catheterization?

00:44:00.710 --> 00:44:05.540
It's when somebody sticks
an IV in your vein, OK?

00:44:05.540 --> 00:44:06.500
Very common.

00:44:06.500 --> 00:44:08.270
You show up at a hospital.

00:44:08.270 --> 00:44:13.800
Before they ask you your name,
they stick an IV in your arm.

00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:16.910
That's a billable event, too.

00:44:16.910 --> 00:44:21.440
Then insertion of an
endotracheal tube,

00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:23.780
you know, if you're having
any problems like that,

00:44:23.780 --> 00:44:26.860
they stick something
down your throat.

00:44:26.860 --> 00:44:30.750
Ventral infusion of concentrated
nutritional substances,

00:44:30.750 --> 00:44:32.990
so if you're not able
to eat, then they

00:44:32.990 --> 00:44:36.290
feed you through a
stomach tube, OK?

00:44:36.290 --> 00:44:39.620
So that's what that is.

00:44:39.620 --> 00:44:42.800
Continuous invasive
mechanical ventilation

00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:45.740
for less than 96
consecutive hours,

00:44:45.740 --> 00:44:49.910
so this is being put
on a ventilator that's

00:44:49.910 --> 00:44:52.080
breathing for you, et cetera.

00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:56.070
So you see that there is
a very long tail of these.

00:44:56.070 --> 00:44:58.490
So those are the ICD-9 codes.

00:44:58.490 --> 00:45:02.450
Now, CPT has its
own procedure codes

00:45:02.450 --> 00:45:05.880
that go into a tremendous
amount of detail.

00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:09.050
So for example, this is
the medicine subsection,

00:45:09.050 --> 00:45:12.200
and it shows you
the kinds of drugs

00:45:12.200 --> 00:45:15.410
that you're being
administered that

00:45:15.410 --> 00:45:21.110
are involved in dialysis,
or psychiatry, or vaccines,

00:45:21.110 --> 00:45:22.730
or whatever.

00:45:22.730 --> 00:45:27.530
And then here are the surgical
and the radiological codes.

00:45:27.530 --> 00:45:29.810
And there's tons and
tons of detail on these.

00:45:29.810 --> 00:45:30.470
Yeah.

00:45:30.470 --> 00:45:34.760
AUDIENCE: So how can they put
these codes as 1,000 to 1,022?

00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:36.800
This is really
annoying for anyone--

00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:38.790
PROFESSOR: No, these
are categories.

00:45:38.790 --> 00:45:45.650
So if you drill down,
there's a fanout of that tree

00:45:45.650 --> 00:45:49.300
and you get down to
individual codes.

00:45:49.300 --> 00:45:54.860
Just as a nasty surprise, CPT
is owned by the American College

00:45:54.860 --> 00:45:59.600
of Physicians, and
they could sue me

00:45:59.600 --> 00:46:03.980
if I showed you the actual codes
because they're copyrighted.

00:46:06.950 --> 00:46:10.485
And you have to pay them
if you use those codes.

00:46:10.485 --> 00:46:10.985
It's crazy.

00:46:13.730 --> 00:46:17.435
OK, so if you look
at the number of all

00:46:17.435 --> 00:46:20.090
of these codes
per admission, you

00:46:20.090 --> 00:46:22.760
see a distribution like this.

00:46:22.760 --> 00:46:24.860
Or if I separate
them out, you see

00:46:24.860 --> 00:46:29.540
that there are more ICD-9
codes and fewer of the CPT

00:46:29.540 --> 00:46:33.050
and the codes that
are in MetaVision.

00:46:33.050 --> 00:46:37.650
But they look somewhat similar
in their distributions.

00:46:37.650 --> 00:46:39.930
OK, lab measurements.

00:46:39.930 --> 00:46:43.760
So you send off a sputum
sample, blood, urine,

00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:46.460
piece of your brain, something.

00:46:46.460 --> 00:46:50.420
They stick it in some goo and
measure something about it.

00:46:50.420 --> 00:46:52.330
So what is it that
they're measuring?

00:46:52.330 --> 00:46:55.840
Well, it turns out
that hematocrit

00:46:55.840 --> 00:46:57.460
is the most common measurement.

00:46:57.460 --> 00:47:02.480
So this is how much
hemoglobin is in your blood,

00:47:02.480 --> 00:47:06.370
or what fraction in your
blood, and is very important

00:47:06.370 --> 00:47:08.750
for sick people.

00:47:08.750 --> 00:47:11.890
And the second most
important is potassium,

00:47:11.890 --> 00:47:15.340
then sodium creatinine,
chloride, urea nitrogen,

00:47:15.340 --> 00:47:16.770
bicarbonate, et cetera.

00:47:16.770 --> 00:47:19.600
So this is a long, long
list of different things

00:47:19.600 --> 00:47:23.990
that can be measured, and all
the stuff is in the database.

00:47:23.990 --> 00:47:29.770
So for example, here's patient
number two in the database.

00:47:29.770 --> 00:47:39.490
And on July 17 of 2138, this
is part of the deidentification

00:47:39.490 --> 00:47:42.730
process to make it
difficult to figure out

00:47:42.730 --> 00:47:45.070
who the patient actually is.

00:47:45.070 --> 00:47:52.450
This person got a
test for their blood

00:47:52.450 --> 00:47:57.618
and they reported
atypical lymphocytes.

00:47:57.618 --> 00:47:59.410
So there are a couple
of interesting things

00:47:59.410 --> 00:48:01.940
to note here.

00:48:01.940 --> 00:48:07.130
One is that some things have
a value and others don't.

00:48:07.130 --> 00:48:09.100
So this is a
qualitative measure,

00:48:09.100 --> 00:48:11.800
so there's no value
associated with it.

00:48:11.800 --> 00:48:15.700
Just the fact of the label tells
you what the result of the test

00:48:15.700 --> 00:48:16.930
was.

00:48:16.930 --> 00:48:18.760
The other thing
that's interesting

00:48:18.760 --> 00:48:21.160
is this last column,
which is LOINK,

00:48:21.160 --> 00:48:25.390
and I'll say a word
about that in a minute--

00:48:25.390 --> 00:48:28.030
actually right now.

00:48:28.030 --> 00:48:32.140
So LOINK is the Logical
Observation Identifiers Names

00:48:32.140 --> 00:48:33.730
and Codes.

00:48:33.730 --> 00:48:35.950
It was developed
by our colleagues

00:48:35.950 --> 00:48:41.890
at Regenstrief Clinic in Indiana
about 15 years ago, maybe 20

00:48:41.890 --> 00:48:44.110
years ago at this point.

00:48:44.110 --> 00:48:48.700
And the attempt was to say every
different type of laboratory

00:48:48.700 --> 00:48:51.890
test ought to have
a unique name,

00:48:51.890 --> 00:48:53.680
and they ought to
be hierarchical

00:48:53.680 --> 00:48:57.220
so that if you have, for
example, three different ways

00:48:57.220 --> 00:49:00.070
of measuring serum
potassium, that they're

00:49:00.070 --> 00:49:02.500
related to each other
but that they're

00:49:02.500 --> 00:49:04.930
distinct from each
other, because there may

00:49:04.930 --> 00:49:07.930
be circumstances under
which the errors that you

00:49:07.930 --> 00:49:13.310
get from one measurement
versus another are different.

00:49:13.310 --> 00:49:16.450
And so this is the standard way.

00:49:16.450 --> 00:49:19.630
If you send off your
blood sample to a lab,

00:49:19.630 --> 00:49:23.440
they send back a string
like this to the hospital

00:49:23.440 --> 00:49:27.220
or to your doctor's
office that says,

00:49:27.220 --> 00:49:30.250
it's coded in this
OBX coding system,

00:49:30.250 --> 00:49:34.720
and here is the
LOINK code, and this

00:49:34.720 --> 00:49:38.050
is the SNOMED interpretation.

00:49:38.050 --> 00:49:42.430
And so this string is the
way that your hospital's EHR

00:49:42.430 --> 00:49:45.400
or your doctor's office
system figures out what

00:49:45.400 --> 00:49:47.740
the result of the test was.

00:49:47.740 --> 00:49:52.300
HL7 is this 30-something
year old organization

00:49:52.300 --> 00:49:55.660
that has been working on
standardizing stuff like this.

00:49:55.660 --> 00:50:00.260
And LOINK is part of
their standardization.

00:50:00.260 --> 00:50:02.830
So if you look at these,
you say, well, again,

00:50:02.830 --> 00:50:05.500
how many tests per admission?

00:50:05.500 --> 00:50:09.400
Again, a huge, long
tail up to about 15,000

00:50:09.400 --> 00:50:14.150
for a very small
number of patients.

00:50:14.150 --> 00:50:18.100
If you look at lab
tests per admission,

00:50:18.100 --> 00:50:21.850
you can do a log
transform and get

00:50:21.850 --> 00:50:25.120
something that looks like a
more reasonable distribution.

00:50:25.120 --> 00:50:27.940
By the way, that's a very
generic lesson when we're

00:50:27.940 --> 00:50:31.000
going to do analyses
of these data, is that,

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:35.890
often, doing a transform of some
sort, like in this case, a log,

00:50:35.890 --> 00:50:38.110
takes some funny
looking distribution

00:50:38.110 --> 00:50:40.990
and turns it into something
that looks plausibly

00:50:40.990 --> 00:50:44.490
normal, which is better for a
lot of the techniques we use.

00:50:44.490 --> 00:50:45.560
Yeah.

00:50:45.560 --> 00:50:50.237
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
means the same thing?

00:50:50.237 --> 00:50:51.070
Like, for instance--

00:50:51.070 --> 00:50:51.760
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:53.727
AUDIENCE: --hematocrit
[INAUDIBLE]

00:50:53.727 --> 00:50:54.310
PROFESSOR: Yes

00:50:54.310 --> 00:50:55.018
AUDIENCE: --same?

00:50:55.018 --> 00:50:55.602
PROFESSOR: Yes

00:50:55.602 --> 00:50:56.590
AUDIENCE: Always same?

00:50:56.590 --> 00:51:00.520
PROFESSOR: Yes, that's the whole
idea of creating the standard.

00:51:00.520 --> 00:51:02.980
And that has been pretty
successful, pretty

00:51:02.980 --> 00:51:06.160
successfully adopted.

00:51:06.160 --> 00:51:08.130
OK, chart events.

00:51:08.130 --> 00:51:10.540
So these are the things
that nurses typically

00:51:10.540 --> 00:51:13.220
enter at the bedside.

00:51:13.220 --> 00:51:18.370
And so there are 5.1,
5.2 million heart rates

00:51:18.370 --> 00:51:20.940
measured in the MIMIC database.

00:51:20.940 --> 00:51:26.080
And calprevslig is an artifact.

00:51:26.080 --> 00:51:28.430
It exists in every record.

00:51:28.430 --> 00:51:31.600
And it's some calibration
something or other

00:51:31.600 --> 00:51:33.130
that doesn't mean anything.

00:51:33.130 --> 00:51:36.090
I've never been able to
figure out exactly what it is.

00:51:36.090 --> 00:51:41.160
SPO2 is the partial pressure
of oxygen in your blood.

00:51:41.160 --> 00:51:44.770
If you use a pulse oximeter,
that's what that's measuring.

00:51:44.770 --> 00:51:49.050
Respiratory rate, heart rhythm,
ectopy type, dot, dot, dot.

00:51:49.050 --> 00:51:51.855
Now, you might be troubled
by the fact that here

00:51:51.855 --> 00:51:55.830
is heart rate again, right?

00:51:55.830 --> 00:52:01.200
But I've already shown you
this, that heart rate in CareVue

00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:03.730
and heart rate in
MetaVision were

00:52:03.730 --> 00:52:08.340
coded under different
codes in the joint system

00:52:08.340 --> 00:52:11.940
that we created out of
those two databases.

00:52:11.940 --> 00:52:16.470
And so you have to take
care of figuring out

00:52:16.470 --> 00:52:20.160
what's what if you're
trying to analyze this data.

00:52:20.160 --> 00:52:24.570
Not only do we have that problem
of different age distributions

00:52:24.570 --> 00:52:27.040
across the two
different data sets,

00:52:27.040 --> 00:52:29.820
but we also just have
the mechanical problem

00:52:29.820 --> 00:52:33.540
that there will be things with
the same label that may or may

00:52:33.540 --> 00:52:37.380
not represent the same
measurement at different times

00:52:37.380 --> 00:52:39.300
in the system.

00:52:39.300 --> 00:52:46.870
OK, this is the number of chart
entries per admission, again,

00:52:46.870 --> 00:52:47.960
on a log scale.

00:52:47.960 --> 00:52:50.020
So you see that
there are about 10

00:52:50.020 --> 00:52:57.600
to the 3.5 chart entries
per admission, so thousands

00:52:57.600 --> 00:53:03.520
of admissions, of chart
events per admission.

00:53:03.520 --> 00:53:06.160
We also track outputs.

00:53:06.160 --> 00:53:10.810
So Foley catheter
allows your bladder

00:53:10.810 --> 00:53:13.300
to drain without your
having consciously

00:53:13.300 --> 00:53:16.720
to go to the bathroom, so
they collect that information.

00:53:16.720 --> 00:53:21.183
There are 1.9 million recordings
of how much fluid came out

00:53:21.183 --> 00:53:21.850
of your bladder.

00:53:24.790 --> 00:53:28.210
Chest tubes will drain
stuff out of your chest

00:53:28.210 --> 00:53:30.070
if you have congestion.

00:53:30.070 --> 00:53:35.620
Urine is if you pee regularly,
stool out, et cetera.

00:53:35.620 --> 00:53:38.350
And again, I'm not
sure I understand

00:53:38.350 --> 00:53:45.220
what the difference is between
urine out Foley versus Foley.

00:53:45.220 --> 00:53:47.650
They may be the
same thing but one

00:53:47.650 --> 00:53:50.740
from CareVue and
one from MetaVision,

00:53:50.740 --> 00:53:53.990
so again, typical
kinds of problems.

00:53:53.990 --> 00:53:59.560
If you look at the number of
output events per admission,

00:53:59.560 --> 00:54:07.960
you're seeing on the
order of 100, roughly.

00:54:07.960 --> 00:54:09.520
Well, if you're
tracking outputs,

00:54:09.520 --> 00:54:13.480
you should also track
inputs, and so they do.

00:54:13.480 --> 00:54:20.110
And so D5W is this dextrose
in water, 0.9 percent

00:54:20.110 --> 00:54:21.750
normal saline.

00:54:21.750 --> 00:54:24.010
Propofol is an anesthetic.

00:54:24.010 --> 00:54:28.300
Insulin, heparin, blood
thinner, et cetera.

00:54:28.300 --> 00:54:33.190
Fentanyl is, I think, an
opioid, if I remember right.

00:54:33.190 --> 00:54:37.090
So these are various things
that are given to people.

00:54:37.090 --> 00:54:41.020
And they affect the
volume of the person.

00:54:41.020 --> 00:54:44.170
So this is an attempt to
keep the person in balance

00:54:44.170 --> 00:54:46.600
and keep track of that.

00:54:46.600 --> 00:54:50.920
MetaVision inputs are
classified somewhat differently

00:54:50.920 --> 00:54:53.770
but they have similar
kinds of data.

00:54:53.770 --> 00:54:56.190
And if you combine
them, you get, again,

00:54:56.190 --> 00:54:59.560
a distribution on
a log scale that

00:54:59.560 --> 00:55:02.050
shows that there are
on the order of 10

00:55:02.050 --> 00:55:05.590
to the fifth input
events, so quite

00:55:05.590 --> 00:55:11.780
a few input events, because
this is recorded periodically.

00:55:11.780 --> 00:55:13.440
Now, the paper that I--

00:55:13.440 --> 00:55:13.940
yeah.

00:55:13.940 --> 00:55:15.374
AUDIENCE: What's
the input again?

00:55:15.374 --> 00:55:17.832
Is that when you come to the
hospital and get admitted or--

00:55:17.832 --> 00:55:18.950
PROFESSOR: No, no, no.

00:55:18.950 --> 00:55:21.460
It's an input into you.

00:55:21.460 --> 00:55:23.570
So it's like you drink
a glass of water,

00:55:23.570 --> 00:55:26.020
the nurse is supposed
to record it.

00:55:26.020 --> 00:55:29.570
Although, she doesn't always
because she may not notice it.

00:55:29.570 --> 00:55:32.890
But if they hang an IV bag
and pour a liter of liquid

00:55:32.890 --> 00:55:38.050
into you, they do
record that, OK?

00:55:38.050 --> 00:55:42.850
All right, so I had you
read this interesting paper

00:55:42.850 --> 00:55:48.790
and a discussion
prior to that paper,

00:55:48.790 --> 00:55:52.810
because one of the authors
is a former student of mine.

00:55:52.810 --> 00:55:56.200
And I know one of the
other guys pretty well.

00:55:56.200 --> 00:56:00.100
And the former
student, Zak Kohane,

00:56:00.100 --> 00:56:05.050
came back some years ago from
a conference in California

00:56:05.050 --> 00:56:07.690
and was explaining to me
that he ran into a venture

00:56:07.690 --> 00:56:10.430
capitalist who
discovered that there

00:56:10.430 --> 00:56:16.840
is an interesting physiological
variation in the abnormality

00:56:16.840 --> 00:56:20.110
of lab tests that
are done at night.

00:56:20.110 --> 00:56:23.690
And he suspected that there
was a diurnal variation

00:56:23.690 --> 00:56:27.250
that lab tests actually
become more abnormal at night

00:56:27.250 --> 00:56:29.800
than they do during the day.

00:56:29.800 --> 00:56:33.760
And Zak, who is not only a
computer science PhD but also

00:56:33.760 --> 00:56:36.670
a practicing doctor,
turns to him and says,

00:56:36.670 --> 00:56:39.430
you're an idiot, right?

00:56:39.430 --> 00:56:45.670
Who has their blood drawn
at 3 o'clock in the morning.

00:56:45.670 --> 00:56:50.650
It's typically not
healthy people, right?

00:56:50.650 --> 00:56:54.910
So this is another of these
nice confounding stories

00:56:54.910 --> 00:57:00.040
where, if you have a test done
in the middle of the night,

00:57:00.040 --> 00:57:03.290
it probably indicates
that you're sicker.

00:57:03.290 --> 00:57:06.340
So he and Griffin recruited
their third author

00:57:06.340 --> 00:57:09.010
and went off and did
a very large scale

00:57:09.010 --> 00:57:11.890
study of this question, which
is what the paper that I

00:57:11.890 --> 00:57:14.860
asked you to read reports on.

00:57:14.860 --> 00:57:18.070
And so I said,
well, I wonder if I

00:57:18.070 --> 00:57:22.210
could reproduce that study
in the MIMIC database.

00:57:22.210 --> 00:57:24.970
And the answer, just in
case you get your hopes up,

00:57:24.970 --> 00:57:30.070
was no, in large part
because we just don't

00:57:30.070 --> 00:57:31.390
have the right kind of data.

00:57:31.390 --> 00:57:33.910
So there are not
that many white blood

00:57:33.910 --> 00:57:38.510
counts that were measured in
the MIMIC database, for example.

00:57:38.510 --> 00:57:41.860
But if you look at the--

00:57:41.860 --> 00:57:43.660
this is MIMIC data.

00:57:43.660 --> 00:57:46.270
And if you say,
what's the fraction

00:57:46.270 --> 00:57:49.480
of abnormal white blood
count values by hour--

00:57:49.480 --> 00:57:53.290
so this is midnight to midnight.

00:57:53.290 --> 00:57:58.000
And each hour, there's some
fraction of these test results

00:57:58.000 --> 00:57:59.380
that are abnormal.

00:57:59.380 --> 00:58:02.050
And sure enough, what you
see is that, at 5 o'clock

00:58:02.050 --> 00:58:04.930
in the morning, a much
higher fraction of them

00:58:04.930 --> 00:58:08.926
is abnormal than at 3
o'clock in the afternoon,

00:58:08.926 --> 00:58:16.210
OK, which is consistent with
Zak's peremptory comment

00:58:16.210 --> 00:58:17.620
about the guy being an idiot.

00:58:20.590 --> 00:58:22.960
So once again, I
said, well, can we

00:58:22.960 --> 00:58:26.500
build a really simple
model that predicts

00:58:26.500 --> 00:58:29.570
who's going to die in the
hospital in this case?

00:58:29.570 --> 00:58:31.210
That's the easiest
one to predict

00:58:31.210 --> 00:58:33.590
because I have that data.

00:58:33.590 --> 00:58:36.760
We could get three-year
survival data, which

00:58:36.760 --> 00:58:38.810
is what they were looking at.

00:58:38.810 --> 00:58:41.590
But it's harder and it runs
into censoring problems

00:58:41.590 --> 00:58:44.620
of what happens if the
person was hospitalized

00:58:44.620 --> 00:58:48.100
less than three years before
the end of our data collection

00:58:48.100 --> 00:58:49.660
period and so on.

00:58:49.660 --> 00:58:51.520
And so I avoided that.

00:58:51.520 --> 00:58:56.590
But what this is showing you
is, for each of the hours,

00:58:56.590 --> 00:59:07.850
zero to 24, what is the
number of measurements?

00:59:07.850 --> 00:59:11.390
And for each of
those hours, what

00:59:11.390 --> 00:59:13.580
is the fraction of those
measurements that's

00:59:13.580 --> 00:59:16.820
abnormal, OK?

00:59:16.820 --> 00:59:18.800
So I said, well,
let's just throw it

00:59:18.800 --> 00:59:21.020
into a logistic
regression model.

00:59:21.020 --> 00:59:23.420
And what comes out is
something really weird,

00:59:23.420 --> 00:59:27.620
which is that a few particular
hours are significant,

00:59:27.620 --> 00:59:29.990
but most of them are not.

00:59:29.990 --> 00:59:33.770
And that looks like
noise to me, right?

00:59:33.770 --> 00:59:40.160
Because you wouldn't
expect that, at 8 o'clock

00:59:40.160 --> 00:59:45.410
in the morning, the fact that
you had something measured

00:59:45.410 --> 00:59:46.580
matters.

00:59:46.580 --> 00:59:49.970
But at 9 o'clock in the
morning, it doesn't.

00:59:49.970 --> 00:59:52.490
That doesn't seem sensible.

00:59:52.490 --> 00:59:55.910
So I don't think there's
enough signal here.

00:59:55.910 --> 01:00:01.520
And in fact, when I looked at
the number of white blood count

01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:04.790
measurements at night and
related to mortality--

01:00:04.790 --> 01:00:09.200
so false means people lived
and true means they died.

01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:11.810
But you see that there's not
a whole lot of difference

01:00:11.810 --> 01:00:13.730
between the distributions.

01:00:13.730 --> 01:00:16.310
But you also see that the
number of white blood counts

01:00:16.310 --> 01:00:18.920
is relatively small
in this database.

01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:24.360
And so I think we just don't
have enough data to do it.

01:00:24.360 --> 01:00:28.070
On the other hand, if you look
at a panel of different drugs,

01:00:28.070 --> 01:00:31.730
you look at mean values of
blood urea nitrogen or calcium

01:00:31.730 --> 01:00:34.910
chloride, CO2, et cetera,
you see that there

01:00:34.910 --> 01:00:38.280
is variation across time.

01:00:38.280 --> 01:00:41.900
So there is some
sort of variance

01:00:41.900 --> 01:00:45.830
that's either caused by
the diurnal physiology

01:00:45.830 --> 01:00:50.300
of the human body or by the
routine practice of medicine,

01:00:50.300 --> 01:00:55.190
about when people choose
to take lab measurements.

01:00:55.190 --> 01:01:01.670
And in fact, if you look at the
fraction of high end low lab

01:01:01.670 --> 01:01:04.580
values, they do vary by hour.

01:01:04.580 --> 01:01:07.970
And in particular, if you
look at white blood counts,

01:01:07.970 --> 01:01:15.200
you see that the fraction of
high values goes up at night

01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:17.660
and the fraction of
low values goes down

01:01:17.660 --> 01:01:20.660
at night, right, which
is consistent with what

01:01:20.660 --> 01:01:23.410
they saw as well.

01:01:23.410 --> 01:01:25.250
There is another
way to measure it,

01:01:25.250 --> 01:01:30.230
which is, instead of
using normal ranges,

01:01:30.230 --> 01:01:33.680
the lab actually gives
you a call that says,

01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:36.530
is this value
normal, low, or high?

01:01:36.530 --> 01:01:38.630
And we can use that.

01:01:38.630 --> 01:01:41.240
That's a little bit
more subtle because it

01:01:41.240 --> 01:01:44.300
depends on calibration
of the equipment

01:01:44.300 --> 01:01:47.220
and is updated as the
calibration changes.

01:01:47.220 --> 01:01:49.610
So that's probably a
little bit more accurate.

01:01:49.610 --> 01:01:53.330
But you see essentially
the same phenomenon here.

01:01:53.330 --> 01:01:59.780
But if you look at the
distributions of when

01:01:59.780 --> 01:02:02.450
measurements are done
that turn out to be normal

01:02:02.450 --> 01:02:05.310
versus when they turn
out to be abnormal,

01:02:05.310 --> 01:02:08.090
there is a lot of similarity
between the normal

01:02:08.090 --> 01:02:12.590
and the abnormal curves of when
those measurements are taken.

01:02:12.590 --> 01:02:15.770
So we're not seeing that.

01:02:15.770 --> 01:02:18.950
OK, let me race
through to the end.

01:02:18.950 --> 01:02:23.240
This is my heartbeat
from my watch.

01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:25.520
You can actually
download the stuff

01:02:25.520 --> 01:02:28.760
and put it in your
favorite analysis engine

01:02:28.760 --> 01:02:30.540
and take a look.

01:02:30.540 --> 01:02:33.650
So here I was running
across the Harvard bridge.

01:02:33.650 --> 01:02:37.670
And if you look at my heart rate
variability over the 30 seconds

01:02:37.670 --> 01:02:41.390
or so, you see that
the interbeat interval

01:02:41.390 --> 01:02:47.240
ranges from about
550 to about 600

01:02:47.240 --> 01:02:50.900
and whatever 20 milliseconds.

01:02:50.900 --> 01:02:53.970
And so you could calculate
my heart rate variability,

01:02:53.970 --> 01:02:57.500
which is thought to be an
indicator of heart health

01:02:57.500 --> 01:02:58.610
and so on.

01:02:58.610 --> 01:03:00.650
You can calculate
that I was running

01:03:00.650 --> 01:03:02.930
at a pace of about 100--

01:03:02.930 --> 01:03:07.320
my heart was beating at a pace
of about 100 beats per minute.

01:03:07.320 --> 01:03:09.620
So you know there's all
sorts of information

01:03:09.620 --> 01:03:11.570
like that available.

01:03:11.570 --> 01:03:15.530
Now, as I said, I'm not
going to get into this today,

01:03:15.530 --> 01:03:19.850
but this was a very
successful recently

01:03:19.850 --> 01:03:22.670
published paper where
they're able to take

01:03:22.670 --> 01:03:26.460
a look at images of the lung.

01:03:26.460 --> 01:03:31.370
So this is a transverse
scan of the lung.

01:03:31.370 --> 01:03:34.100
And they have a deep
learning machine

01:03:34.100 --> 01:03:37.880
that is able to identify
these two yellow marked things

01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:42.020
as pulmonary emboli as opposed
to these other things that

01:03:42.020 --> 01:03:45.270
are just random
flecks in the tissue.

01:03:45.270 --> 01:03:47.820
And I can't do that by eyeball.

01:03:47.820 --> 01:03:51.230
Maybe a good radiologist
might be able to,

01:03:51.230 --> 01:03:55.340
but this is claimed in
the paper to outperform

01:03:55.340 --> 01:03:58.070
decent radiologists already.

01:03:58.070 --> 01:03:59.930
This was one of
the articles that

01:03:59.930 --> 01:04:03.710
led Geoff Hinton to make this
rather stupid pronouncement

01:04:03.710 --> 01:04:08.130
that said, tell your children
not to become radiologists

01:04:08.130 --> 01:04:12.390
because the profession will be
over by the time they get fully

01:04:12.390 --> 01:04:15.060
trained, which I don't believe.

01:04:15.060 --> 01:04:18.120
They may do different things,
but they won't go away.

01:04:20.670 --> 01:04:25.170
This was a slide from Ron
Kikinis at the Brigham,

01:04:25.170 --> 01:04:27.960
and they're using
automated techniques

01:04:27.960 --> 01:04:31.380
of analyzing white
matter in order

01:04:31.380 --> 01:04:33.810
to identify lupus lesions.

01:04:33.810 --> 01:04:38.490
So lupus is a bad
disease that shows up

01:04:38.490 --> 01:04:44.880
in these magnetic resonance
images in certain ways.

01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:48.210
The last thing I want to
talk about today is notes.

01:04:48.210 --> 01:04:54.420
So my students did a little
exercise last semester

01:04:54.420 --> 01:05:01.320
where we tried to see how good
is the average ape, namely

01:05:01.320 --> 01:05:07.390
member of my research group,
at predicting mortality?

01:05:07.390 --> 01:05:10.330
And so we took a bunch of
cases from the MIMIC data

01:05:10.330 --> 01:05:14.400
set, blinded to the question
of whether the person lived

01:05:14.400 --> 01:05:15.390
or died.

01:05:15.390 --> 01:05:18.780
We gave the data to people in
a kind of visualization tool,

01:05:18.780 --> 01:05:21.630
sort of like the one that
I showed you earlier,

01:05:21.630 --> 01:05:26.610
that summarizes the case, and
then also gave people access

01:05:26.610 --> 01:05:30.930
to the notes, the deidentified
notes about those cases,

01:05:30.930 --> 01:05:34.560
to see whether people could
predict, better than a coin

01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:39.150
flip, whether somebody
was going to live or die.

01:05:39.150 --> 01:05:42.870
And the answer is yes,
slightly better, OK?

01:05:42.870 --> 01:05:46.170
Not immensely better
but slightly better.

01:05:46.170 --> 01:05:50.380
And furthermore, it looks
like, by giving them feedback,

01:05:50.380 --> 01:05:52.890
so as they're looking
at these cases

01:05:52.890 --> 01:05:54.765
and trying to make
the prediction,

01:05:54.765 --> 01:05:56.640
they make a prediction,
you tell them if they

01:05:56.640 --> 01:06:00.000
were right or wrong, we learn.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:03.480
And so we get slightly
better than slightly better

01:06:03.480 --> 01:06:05.950
than random, right?

01:06:05.950 --> 01:06:07.940
It's kind of interesting.

01:06:07.940 --> 01:06:11.250
OK, so one of the
things I discovered

01:06:11.250 --> 01:06:13.440
is that, at least
when I was playing

01:06:13.440 --> 01:06:17.160
the monkey in this
exercise, I found the notes

01:06:17.160 --> 01:06:20.490
to be immensely useful,
much more useful

01:06:20.490 --> 01:06:24.660
than the trend lines
of laboratory data.

01:06:24.660 --> 01:06:27.390
Partly, it's because I'm
used to reading English.

01:06:27.390 --> 01:06:31.950
I'm not so used to reading
graphs of laboratory data.

01:06:31.950 --> 01:06:35.430
But part of it is that there is
a level of human understanding

01:06:35.430 --> 01:06:38.670
that is transmitted
in the nursing notes

01:06:38.670 --> 01:06:42.120
and in the discharge summaries
and so on that you don't get

01:06:42.120 --> 01:06:44.340
from just looking at raw data.

01:06:44.340 --> 01:06:47.310
And so there is very
much the sense, which

01:06:47.310 --> 01:06:49.800
we're going to talk about
in a couple of weeks,

01:06:49.800 --> 01:06:54.930
of how can we take advantage
of that information,

01:06:54.930 --> 01:06:57.600
extract it, and use it
in the kinds of modeling

01:06:57.600 --> 01:06:59.140
that we want to do?

01:06:59.140 --> 01:07:01.710
So in MIMIC, if
you look, we have

01:07:01.710 --> 01:07:04.080
nursing notes, and
radiology reports,

01:07:04.080 --> 01:07:08.160
and more nursing notes, and
electrocardiogram reports,

01:07:08.160 --> 01:07:10.600
and doctor's notes, and
discharge summaries,

01:07:10.600 --> 01:07:16.170
and echocardiograms,
respiratory, et cetera.

01:07:16.170 --> 01:07:18.630
And if you look at
the distribution

01:07:18.630 --> 01:07:22.950
of the lengths of these,
these are, unfortunately,

01:07:22.950 --> 01:07:24.780
not on the same scale.

01:07:24.780 --> 01:07:26.790
But the discharge
summary is the thing

01:07:26.790 --> 01:07:30.010
that's written at the time
you leave the hospital.

01:07:30.010 --> 01:07:32.190
So this is sort of the
summary of everything

01:07:32.190 --> 01:07:35.310
that happened to you during
your hospitalization.

01:07:35.310 --> 01:07:36.330
And it's long.

01:07:36.330 --> 01:07:41.190
So, you know, it goes up
to like 30,000 characters.

01:07:41.190 --> 01:07:48.240
You know, it's a short story,
not so short short story.

01:07:48.240 --> 01:07:50.580
Nursing notes tend
to be shorter.

01:07:50.580 --> 01:07:53.490
They run up to about
3,000 characters.

01:07:53.490 --> 01:07:55.500
This other set of
nursing notes, which

01:07:55.500 --> 01:07:59.040
I think comes from the other
system, is a little bit longer.

01:07:59.040 --> 01:08:01.560
It goes up to about 5,000.

01:08:01.560 --> 01:08:03.930
Doctor's notes are a
little bit longer yet.

01:08:03.930 --> 01:08:09.030
They go up to about 10,000,
15,000 characters, typically.

01:08:09.030 --> 01:08:11.760
And there are various
other kinds of notes.

01:08:11.760 --> 01:08:14.470
So I just wanted to
show you a few of these.

01:08:14.470 --> 01:08:16.080
Here's a brief nursing note.

01:08:16.080 --> 01:08:20.939
So this is a patient who is
hypotensive but not in shock.

01:08:20.939 --> 01:08:23.399
Patient remains
on this drug drip

01:08:23.399 --> 01:08:27.930
at 0.75 micrograms per
kilogram per minute,

01:08:27.930 --> 01:08:30.479
no titration needed
at this time.

01:08:30.479 --> 01:08:32.810
Their blood pressure is
stable at more than 100.

01:08:32.810 --> 01:08:38.130
Their mean arterial pressure
is 65, greater than 65.

01:08:38.130 --> 01:08:42.660
Wean them from this drug
presumably if it's tolerated.

01:08:42.660 --> 01:08:47.220
A wound infection, so
anterior groin area

01:08:47.220 --> 01:08:52.560
open and oozing moderate amounts
of thin, pink-tinged serous

01:08:52.560 --> 01:08:53.479
fluid.

01:08:53.479 --> 01:08:57.660
Patient's stooling with small
amounts of stool on something

01:08:57.660 --> 01:09:01.170
and dangerously close to
the open wound, et cetera.

01:09:01.170 --> 01:09:04.200
So this is sort of
the nurse's snapshot.

01:09:04.200 --> 01:09:07.010
She just went in,
saw the patient--

01:09:07.010 --> 01:09:10.399
by the way, I say
she, but probably

01:09:10.399 --> 01:09:14.540
a vast majority of nurses
in Boston area hospitals

01:09:14.540 --> 01:09:19.189
really are women, but there
are some male nurses--

01:09:19.189 --> 01:09:22.250
and will record sort
of a snapshot of what's

01:09:22.250 --> 01:09:24.149
going on with the patient.

01:09:24.149 --> 01:09:25.729
What are the concerns?

01:09:25.729 --> 01:09:28.970
In principle, this is
going to be useful not only

01:09:28.970 --> 01:09:32.210
as a part of the medical
record, but also when

01:09:32.210 --> 01:09:36.470
this nurse goes off shift and
the next nurse comes on shift.

01:09:36.470 --> 01:09:39.380
Then this is a recording of
what the state of the patient

01:09:39.380 --> 01:09:43.130
was the last time they
were seen by the nurse.

01:09:43.130 --> 01:09:46.939
In reality, the nurses tend
to tell each other verbally

01:09:46.939 --> 01:09:50.750
rather than relying on
the written version.

01:09:50.750 --> 01:09:54.350
I remember one time talking to
a nurse in an intensive care

01:09:54.350 --> 01:09:57.080
unit in another part of
the country, and I said,

01:09:57.080 --> 01:10:00.350
so whoever reads
your notes, and she

01:10:00.350 --> 01:10:08.060
says, quality assurance
officers, so the hospital has

01:10:08.060 --> 01:10:10.310
people responsible
for trying to assess

01:10:10.310 --> 01:10:12.740
the quality of care
they're giving,

01:10:12.740 --> 01:10:15.890
and lawyers when
there's a lawsuit.

01:10:15.890 --> 01:10:19.190
And she was very happy because
she had saved the hospital

01:10:19.190 --> 01:10:22.910
10 million dollars by
having carefully recorded

01:10:22.910 --> 01:10:26.900
that some procedure had been
done to a patient who then

01:10:26.900 --> 01:10:31.430
had a bad outcome and was suing
the hospital for their neglect

01:10:31.430 --> 01:10:33.050
in not having done this.

01:10:33.050 --> 01:10:35.390
But because it was
in the note, that

01:10:35.390 --> 01:10:37.670
was proof that it
actually had been done,

01:10:37.670 --> 01:10:40.415
and therefore the
hospital wasn't liable.

01:10:43.310 --> 01:10:45.950
But there is a lot of
information in here.

01:10:45.950 --> 01:10:50.090
Now, I'm going to show you many
pages of a typical discharge

01:10:50.090 --> 01:10:51.020
summary.

01:10:51.020 --> 01:10:54.800
So this is somebody
on the surgery service

01:10:54.800 --> 01:10:59.750
who came in complaining
of leg pain, redness,

01:10:59.750 --> 01:11:02.630
and swelling
secondary to infection

01:11:02.630 --> 01:11:07.610
of the left femoral
popliteal bypass.

01:11:07.610 --> 01:11:09.980
So she had surgery--

01:11:09.980 --> 01:11:10.700
I think she.

01:11:10.700 --> 01:11:11.810
Yeah, female.

01:11:11.810 --> 01:11:15.320
She had surgery which
didn't heal well,

01:11:15.320 --> 01:11:19.430
so major surgical or
invasive procedure, incision

01:11:19.430 --> 01:11:22.670
and drainage and pulse
irrigation of the left groin,

01:11:22.670 --> 01:11:29.150
and left above-knee popliteal
site incisions with exploration

01:11:29.150 --> 01:11:34.370
of bypass graft, and excision of
the entire left common femoral

01:11:34.370 --> 01:11:37.460
artery to above-knee blah,
blah, blah, blah blah, blah.

01:11:37.460 --> 01:11:40.010
So this is what they did.

01:11:40.010 --> 01:11:41.910
History of the present illness--

01:11:41.910 --> 01:11:44.280
she's a 45-year-old
woman who underwent

01:11:44.280 --> 01:11:47.130
the left femoral, a.k.a.

01:11:47.130 --> 01:11:51.410
doctor something or other
with PTFE, whatever that

01:11:51.410 --> 01:11:55.130
is, over a month ago
on a certain date.

01:11:55.130 --> 01:11:57.800
By the way, these
bracketed asterisked things

01:11:57.800 --> 01:12:01.340
are where we've taken out
identifying information

01:12:01.340 --> 01:12:04.310
from the record.

01:12:04.310 --> 01:12:06.320
She had been doing
well post-operatively

01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:09.780
and was seen in the clinic six
days prior to presentation.

01:12:09.780 --> 01:12:12.320
At this time, she acutely
developed nausea, vomiting,

01:12:12.320 --> 01:12:14.970
fevers, and progressive
redness, swelling,

01:12:14.970 --> 01:12:17.940
pain of her left
thigh, et cetera, OK?

01:12:17.940 --> 01:12:20.820
So that's just page
one of many pages.

01:12:20.820 --> 01:12:21.320
Yeah.

01:12:21.320 --> 01:12:22.403
AUDIENCE: Just a question.

01:12:22.403 --> 01:12:27.950
Is this completely [INAUDIBLE]
information [INAUDIBLE]

01:12:27.950 --> 01:12:29.300
patient's name or date?

01:12:29.300 --> 01:12:31.310
PROFESSOR: Not in this system.

01:12:31.310 --> 01:12:32.870
There are people--

01:12:32.870 --> 01:12:35.150
Henry Chueh at
Mass General spent

01:12:35.150 --> 01:12:39.890
10 years building a system that
had autocomplete and so on.

01:12:39.890 --> 01:12:43.820
And some doctors liked it
and some doctors hated it.

01:12:43.820 --> 01:12:48.050
And the MGH threw out
all of their old systems

01:12:48.050 --> 01:12:51.090
in order to buy Epic,
and so it's gone.

01:12:51.090 --> 01:12:54.390
It was like 10 years
of work down the drain.

01:12:54.390 --> 01:12:57.740
But it was not a
spectacular success.

01:12:57.740 --> 01:13:00.500
Because whenever you
have auto complete,

01:13:00.500 --> 01:13:03.740
you have to anticipate
every possible answer.

01:13:03.740 --> 01:13:05.840
And people are very
creative, and they always

01:13:05.840 --> 01:13:09.050
want to type something
that you didn't anticipate.

01:13:09.050 --> 01:13:11.392
So it's hard to support it.

01:13:11.392 --> 01:13:12.350
AUDIENCE: What is Epic?

01:13:12.350 --> 01:13:13.250
That's like the new--

01:13:13.250 --> 01:13:15.290
PROFESSOR: Epic is
a big company that

01:13:15.290 --> 01:13:19.190
has been winning all the
recent contests for installing

01:13:19.190 --> 01:13:21.620
electronic medical
record systems.

01:13:21.620 --> 01:13:23.930
Remember in my last
lecture, I showed that we're

01:13:23.930 --> 01:13:26.780
reaching about 100% saturation?

01:13:26.780 --> 01:13:34.340
So they've been winning a lot
of the installation deals.

01:13:34.340 --> 01:13:38.360
And they're getting
a lot of the subsidy.

01:13:38.360 --> 01:13:41.780
The estimate I heard was that
Partners Healthcare, which

01:13:41.780 --> 01:13:45.350
is MGH at the Brigham and a
couple of other hospitals,

01:13:45.350 --> 01:13:48.680
spent somewhere on the
order of two billion dollars

01:13:48.680 --> 01:13:50.940
installing the system.

01:13:50.940 --> 01:13:53.270
So that included all
the customizations

01:13:53.270 --> 01:13:56.330
and all the training and
all the administrative stuff

01:13:56.330 --> 01:13:57.560
that went with it.

01:13:57.560 --> 01:14:00.040
But that's a huge
amount of money.

01:14:00.040 --> 01:14:01.880
AUDIENCE: I agree.

01:14:01.880 --> 01:14:06.600
PROFESSOR: OK, so we have
past medical history--

01:14:06.600 --> 01:14:10.320
pack a day smoker,
abused cocaine

01:14:10.320 --> 01:14:12.660
but says she stopped
six months ago,

01:14:12.660 --> 01:14:16.000
has asthma, type 2 diabetes.

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:17.955
Social history, family history.

01:14:22.890 --> 01:14:24.675
These are of the
physical exam results.

01:14:27.400 --> 01:14:31.740
So it's giving you a lot of
information about the person.

01:14:31.740 --> 01:14:35.250
Description of the wound
down at the bottom.

01:14:35.250 --> 01:14:37.030
Pertinent lab results.

01:14:37.030 --> 01:14:39.420
So these are copied out
of the laboratory tables.

01:14:39.420 --> 01:14:39.920
Yeah.

01:14:39.920 --> 01:14:41.900
AUDIENCE: Just to double
check with the drug results--

01:14:41.900 --> 01:14:42.510
PROFESSOR: Sorry?

01:14:42.510 --> 01:14:43.870
AUDIENCE: Just to double
check with the drug results

01:14:43.870 --> 01:14:44.886
two slides back--

01:14:44.886 --> 01:14:45.511
PROFESSOR: Yeah

01:14:45.511 --> 01:14:52.050
AUDIENCE: It said-- so it
has the fake dates of 2190

01:14:52.050 --> 01:14:52.845
up there.

01:14:52.845 --> 01:14:53.470
PROFESSOR: Yep.

01:14:53.470 --> 01:14:56.345
AUDIENCE: So the fact that there
was a positive test in 2187

01:14:56.345 --> 01:14:57.773
would mean a year ago.

01:14:57.773 --> 01:14:58.440
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:14:58.440 --> 01:15:00.440
AUDIENCE: So that's
the medication.

01:15:00.440 --> 01:15:03.910
PROFESSOR: Yeah, the
deindenfication technology here

01:15:03.910 --> 01:15:07.540
maintains the relative dates
but not the absolute dates.

01:15:14.510 --> 01:15:17.690
So these are results,
again, copied out

01:15:17.690 --> 01:15:22.490
of the laboratory database
into the discharge summary.

01:15:22.490 --> 01:15:26.820
Brief hospital course, and
then a review of systems,

01:15:26.820 --> 01:15:29.690
so what's going on
neurologically, cardiovascular,

01:15:29.690 --> 01:15:34.130
pulmonary, GI, GU, et cetera.

01:15:34.130 --> 01:15:38.930
Infectious disease, endocrine,
hematology, prophylaxis.

01:15:38.930 --> 01:15:41.090
And at the time was
discharged, the patient

01:15:41.090 --> 01:15:45.170
was doing well, no fever
and stable vital signs,

01:15:45.170 --> 01:15:47.630
tolerating a regular
diet, ambulating, voiding

01:15:47.630 --> 01:15:51.980
without assistance, and
pain was well controlled.

01:15:51.980 --> 01:15:54.260
Medications on
admission, so this

01:15:54.260 --> 01:15:57.280
was the medication
reconciliation.

01:15:57.280 --> 01:16:01.780
Discharge medication, so this is
what she's being sent home on.

01:16:01.780 --> 01:16:05.840
Discharge disposition
is to the home with some

01:16:05.840 --> 01:16:11.630
follow up service,
and she's going home.

01:16:11.630 --> 01:16:15.410
And the discharge
diagnosis is infected

01:16:15.410 --> 01:16:20.180
left femoral popliteal bypass
graft and the condition.

01:16:20.180 --> 01:16:24.242
And these are the instructions
to the patient that say, you

01:16:24.242 --> 01:16:26.450
know, here's what you can
do, here is when you should

01:16:26.450 --> 01:16:28.950
come back and tell us if
something is going wrong,

01:16:28.950 --> 01:16:29.460
et cetera.

01:16:32.330 --> 01:16:37.340
And here's what you should
report if it happens.

01:16:37.340 --> 01:16:40.040
You know, if you have sudden
severe bleeding or swelling,

01:16:40.040 --> 01:16:41.120
do this.

01:16:41.120 --> 01:16:44.060
Follow up with doctor
somebody or other.

01:16:44.060 --> 01:16:49.140
Call his clinic at this number
to schedule an appointment

01:16:49.140 --> 01:16:53.840
and then follow up with doctor
somebody else in two weeks.

01:16:59.670 --> 01:17:02.040
I think this is the same one.

01:17:02.040 --> 01:17:06.260
So just a couple of final
words about standards.

01:17:06.260 --> 01:17:09.650
So you saw in David's
introductory lecture

01:17:09.650 --> 01:17:13.790
a reference to Odyssey, which
is a standard method of encoding

01:17:13.790 --> 01:17:17.640
the kind of data that
we're talking about today.

01:17:17.640 --> 01:17:21.020
There is a likelihood that
the next release of the MIMIC

01:17:21.020 --> 01:17:26.620
database will adopt the Odyssey
formats rather than the--

01:17:26.620 --> 01:17:27.740
yeah.

01:17:27.740 --> 01:17:31.250
David's shaking his
head, wondering why.

01:17:31.250 --> 01:17:31.750
Me, too.

01:17:34.430 --> 01:17:37.460
AUDIENCE: Odyssey hasn't handled
clinical notes very well yet.

01:17:37.460 --> 01:17:40.430
PROFESSOR: Well, so, you
know, what always happens,

01:17:40.430 --> 01:17:44.090
as you say, I'm going to
adopt the standard asterisk

01:17:44.090 --> 01:17:46.460
with the following extensions.

01:17:46.460 --> 01:17:48.470
And that's probably
what's going to happen.

01:17:48.470 --> 01:17:51.980
But it means that the
central tables, you

01:17:51.980 --> 01:17:55.820
know, the ICD-9 code tables and
the drug tables, some things

01:17:55.820 --> 01:17:59.270
like that, are likely to
wind up adopting the formats

01:17:59.270 --> 01:18:03.260
of the Odyssey database.

01:18:03.260 --> 01:18:07.850
You should also know about this
thing called FHIR, F-H-I-R,

01:18:07.850 --> 01:18:11.720
the Fast Health
Interoperability Resources.

01:18:11.720 --> 01:18:15.950
So HL7 is the
standards organization

01:18:15.950 --> 01:18:21.110
that had a tremendous
success in the early 1990s

01:18:21.110 --> 01:18:24.740
in solving the problem of how
to allow laboratories to report

01:18:24.740 --> 01:18:27.950
lab data back to the
hospitals or the clinics that

01:18:27.950 --> 01:18:29.990
ordered the labs.

01:18:29.990 --> 01:18:33.860
And that character
string with the up arrows

01:18:33.860 --> 01:18:36.470
and the vertical bars and
so on that I showed you

01:18:36.470 --> 01:18:41.210
before that had LOINK encoded
in it is that standard.

01:18:41.210 --> 01:18:44.090
That's called HL7 Version 2.

01:18:44.090 --> 01:18:48.440
It's still in use very widely,
they then got ambitious

01:18:48.440 --> 01:18:51.590
and suffered second
system syndrome, which

01:18:51.590 --> 01:18:55.440
is they decided to
build HL7 Version 3,

01:18:55.440 --> 01:18:59.390
which I used to teach in
a class here 10 years ago.

01:18:59.390 --> 01:19:03.740
But one of my friends who
works for a company that

01:19:03.740 --> 01:19:10.640
helps hospitals implement that
sent me a 38 megabyte PDF file

01:19:10.640 --> 01:19:13.370
that describes what you
need to know in order

01:19:13.370 --> 01:19:15.480
to implement that system.

01:19:15.480 --> 01:19:18.440
And as a result,
nobody was doing it.

01:19:18.440 --> 01:19:21.800
So FHIR is a gross
simplification

01:19:21.800 --> 01:19:24.500
of that that starts
off and says,

01:19:24.500 --> 01:19:28.460
if a doctor refers a
new patient to you,

01:19:28.460 --> 01:19:31.970
what is the minimum set of data
that you need to know in order

01:19:31.970 --> 01:19:33.950
to take care of that person?

01:19:33.950 --> 01:19:39.620
And FHIR tries to provide just
that subset of all of the data.

01:19:39.620 --> 01:19:43.730
It has become a standard mainly
because, after Congress spent

01:19:43.730 --> 01:19:47.060
$42 billion dollars
or so bribing people

01:19:47.060 --> 01:19:49.520
into buying these
information systems,

01:19:49.520 --> 01:19:52.700
they got mad that the
information systems they bought

01:19:52.700 --> 01:19:54.590
couldn't talk to each other.

01:19:54.590 --> 01:19:57.350
And so they called in,
on the carpet, the heads

01:19:57.350 --> 01:20:01.280
of these IT companies,
health IT companies,

01:20:01.280 --> 01:20:02.900
and they yelled at
them and they made

01:20:02.900 --> 01:20:06.260
them promise that there
would be interoperability.

01:20:06.260 --> 01:20:07.220
They promised.

01:20:07.220 --> 01:20:09.800
And out of that came FHIR.

01:20:09.800 --> 01:20:14.210
It was probably simultaneously
developed but they adopted it.

01:20:14.210 --> 01:20:18.260
And so now, in principle,
it's possible to exchange

01:20:18.260 --> 01:20:21.020
data between different
hospitals, at least

01:20:21.020 --> 01:20:26.180
to the level of that degree
of harmonization of the data.

01:20:26.180 --> 01:20:29.070
In reality, the
companies don't want

01:20:29.070 --> 01:20:33.200
you to do that because they
like there to be friction

01:20:33.200 --> 01:20:35.390
in not being able to
take all your data

01:20:35.390 --> 01:20:39.170
to a different hospital, because
it is more likely to leave you

01:20:39.170 --> 01:20:41.450
at the one that you're at.

01:20:41.450 --> 01:20:44.960
So there is complicated
socioeconomic kinds

01:20:44.960 --> 01:20:46.700
of issues in all this.

01:20:46.700 --> 01:20:50.000
But at least the standard exists
and is becoming more and more

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:53.810
widely deployed as long as
Congress pays attention.

01:20:53.810 --> 01:20:54.860
It's ugly.

01:20:54.860 --> 01:20:58.100
So here is what a patient
looks like, right?

01:20:58.100 --> 01:21:01.790
It's the usual
unreadable XML garbage.

01:21:01.790 --> 01:21:03.980
But fortunately,
there are parsers

01:21:03.980 --> 01:21:08.340
that can turn it into JSON
and simpler representations.

01:21:08.340 --> 01:21:11.370
And so that's pretty common.

01:21:11.370 --> 01:21:17.660
So the terminologies that exist
are LOINK, NBC, ICD-9 and 10.

01:21:17.660 --> 01:21:19.520
SNOMED I didn't
talk about today.

01:21:19.520 --> 01:21:23.210
DSM-5 is the Diagnostic
and Statistical

01:21:23.210 --> 01:21:25.850
Manual for Psychiatrists.

01:21:25.850 --> 01:21:28.220
That's used as a
common coding method

01:21:28.220 --> 01:21:31.730
for describing
psychiatric disease.

01:21:31.730 --> 01:21:33.800
And there are many
more of these.

01:21:33.800 --> 01:21:36.740
There's something called
the Unified Medical Language

01:21:36.740 --> 01:21:41.060
Systems Metathesaurus from the
National Library of Medicine

01:21:41.060 --> 01:21:47.660
that integrates about 180 of
these different terminologies.

01:21:47.660 --> 01:21:52.400
And so there is a
nice one-stop shop

01:21:52.400 --> 01:21:55.550
where you can get all
these things from them.

01:21:59.670 --> 01:22:02.860
So takeaway lessons,
know your data.

01:22:02.860 --> 01:22:06.060
Remember that first example
of the heart rates, that

01:22:06.060 --> 01:22:08.010
comes up over and over again.

01:22:08.010 --> 01:22:12.150
And doing machine learning
and analysis on data

01:22:12.150 --> 01:22:15.270
that you don't understand
is likely to lead you

01:22:15.270 --> 01:22:18.480
to false conclusions.

01:22:18.480 --> 01:22:21.150
Harmonization is difficult
and time consuming.

01:22:21.150 --> 01:22:23.070
And there are lots of
things for which we just

01:22:23.070 --> 01:22:25.920
don't have standards,
and so everybody develops

01:22:25.920 --> 01:22:27.930
their own representations.

01:22:27.930 --> 01:22:33.270
I had a PhD student about a
decade ago who, in his thesis,

01:22:33.270 --> 01:22:37.620
wrote that he spent about
half his time cleaning data.

01:22:37.620 --> 01:22:40.800
And I gave that thesis
to another student who

01:22:40.800 --> 01:22:43.270
started a few years
later who read it,

01:22:43.270 --> 01:22:47.280
and he comes to me just
awestruck and he says, what?

01:22:47.280 --> 01:22:51.900
He only spent half
his time cleaning?

01:22:51.900 --> 01:22:55.830
Unfortunately, that's roughly
where we are in this field.

01:22:55.830 --> 01:22:58.980
So sorry to be a
downer, but that's

01:22:58.980 --> 01:23:01.050
the current state of the art.

01:23:01.050 --> 01:23:04.890
And next time, David will start
by looking at actually building

01:23:04.890 --> 01:23:08.370
some models with
these kinds of data

01:23:08.370 --> 01:23:11.580
and showing you what
we can accomplish.

01:23:11.580 --> 01:23:13.370
Thank you.

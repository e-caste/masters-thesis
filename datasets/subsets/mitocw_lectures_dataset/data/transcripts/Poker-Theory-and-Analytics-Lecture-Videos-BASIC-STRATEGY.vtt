00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.157
PROFESSOR: OK, so
welcome back everyone.

00:00:30.157 --> 00:00:32.240
This is going to be the
first class we're actually

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.944
talking about poker strategy, so
this should be pretty exciting.

00:00:34.944 --> 00:00:37.360
So the first thing we're going
to learn about is position,

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.560
and this is only
three slides long.

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.391
So positions have
different names.

00:00:42.391 --> 00:00:43.890
They're put in two
different groups,

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.800
and a lot of how
we describe what's

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.270
going in a particular
hand is going

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:49.211
to be relevant to where
people are sitting.

00:00:49.211 --> 00:00:49.710
Why?

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.210
Because people in
a late position

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.940
get to act after people
in an early position.

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.700
And in general, the
positions are broken

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.010
into four different groups.

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.370
There are the blinds,
who pay the blinds

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.870
and are first act on every
street after a pre-flop.

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.645
There's early position,
middle position,

00:01:05.645 --> 00:01:10.080
and late position, where all
these positions have names,

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.680
except middle position.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.150
Starting in the big blind,
we call it under the gun,

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.840
under the gun plus 1,
under the gun plus 2.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.030
You could also describe
these as seat 1, 2, 3, 4

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.560
all the way to 9 or 10,
although I don't really

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.820
like that because I they all
have pretty unique names,

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:31.160
and they're descriptive
enough to just use those.

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:35.010
So middle position is labeled
one, two, and three, and then

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:37.410
around the button you
describe their relation

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:39.680
to the button, where
either you are the button

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.670
or you are cutting
off the button.

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.640
And then some people get a
little crazy by calling this

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.770
the hijack, but I
tend to not do that,

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:50.360
and then as we
eliminate people, we

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.710
get rid of the least
interesting positions

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.970
to only keep the
ones with real names.

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.290
So the reason that I'm
telling you this now

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:01.500
is we're going to be
going through hands

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.200
where I talk about
players by their position.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.140
The individual person
doesn't matter,

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.600
but it's much to
understand what's

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.410
going on when I refer to them
as a cut off, or the button,

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:12.260
or whatever.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.460
But in general,
the later position

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:17.380
is better because you
get more information.

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.670
You get to see people
acting before you.

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:27.120
And as a result, the
money flows, in general,

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.150
to the late positions.

00:02:30.795 --> 00:02:32.420
The hand that you're
the button, you're

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.290
going to make the
most amount of money,

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.230
and you can see that
in poker tracker.

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.620
And if you're losing
money on the button,

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.380
you should seriously
reevaluate how

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.213
you're playing that,
because that's when you

00:02:42.213 --> 00:02:44.180
make the most amount of money.

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.610
Big blinds are an
interesting situation

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.050
because they get to see
the flop for a discount,

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:53.344
because they're compelled
to pay some sort of bet.

00:02:53.344 --> 00:02:55.510
So you might think the
blinds are in a good position

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.620
because they get a free
flop, but they're actually

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.540
in a terrible position because
when position matters post flop

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.970
they are the first to act
in every single situation.

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.720
So even though you
might think that you're

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.760
getting a discount for
being in the blinds,

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.522
you're getting a
discount and entry

00:03:09.522 --> 00:03:11.480
into a hand where you're
almost certainly going

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.400
to be at a major
informational disadvantage.

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.390
However, interestingly,
in short stack situations,

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:21.890
early position is
actually better

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:25.930
because you have the
opportunity to go

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.700
all in before the
other person does,

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:33.680
and you maintain the equity from
aggression, the fold equity,

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.160
which we'll talk about later.

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.096
It's sort of like a
game of chicken where--

00:03:39.096 --> 00:03:41.910
so chicken is a game where
two people drive at each other

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:45.860
until one person turns, where
it's like the an infinitely bad

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:51.720
return if they both don't turn,
and then one wins if one turns

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:52.820
and one doesn't.

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:54.800
So the proper
strategy in chicken

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:58.650
is to throw your steering
wheel out the window

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.680
so the other person
knows he only

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.380
has one option if he doesn't
want an infinitely big loss.

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:06.620
So with position, it works
very similar to that,

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:09.610
where if you're in a tournament
where neither person wants

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:12.250
to see a showdown,
neither person wants

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:15.540
to deal with a coin flip
for their tournament life,

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.649
if you're in early position,
you have the opportunity

00:04:18.649 --> 00:04:20.850
to be the aggressor
and go all in.

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:22.930
So you get to discourage
the other person

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:24.770
from entering into it.

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:27.550
So let's move on to
some basic concepts.

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:31.200
So a lot of these things
are based on odds.

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.800
So poker is a statistical
game, and we're

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:38.210
going to be talking about
applications of math to poker.

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:42.040
So why does drawing matter?

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:45.920
So drawing means you're
trying to make a hand.

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:47.930
More cards that will
come out will give you

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:50.900
a really good hand, whereas
you don't necessarily

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:53.060
have a good hand right now.

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:55.550
In a really common
situation, there's

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:58.370
one guy that has an
OK hand, and there's

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:00.580
one guy that has nothing
but the potential

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:03.350
to have a really good hand.

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:05.520
Most of the decision
points come down

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:09.830
to whether the guy with
nothing has equity,

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:13.260
has an interest in
making his real hand.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.370
So really common
examples of these

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:17.980
are one person has
a pair or two pair,

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:21.190
and one guy has a
straight or a flush draw.

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:23.690
If we're talking pre-flop,
someone has a pocket pair,

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:25.971
and someone else has
literally anything else,

00:05:25.971 --> 00:05:28.220
and they're trying to make
anything more than whatever

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:29.240
that guy's pairs is.

00:05:32.217 --> 00:05:33.800
So what the drawer
has to to-- the guy

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:36.530
without a real hand-- is
to decide whether the bet

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:39.550
he is facing or whatever
has to pay to see more cards

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:44.090
to find out if he makes
his hand is worth the cost,

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:49.130
is worth what the
aggressor is making him pay

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:51.110
to see that additional card.

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:56.000
And the person who has a
hand already wants to make it

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.130
so that the drawer cannot see
his card for a positive equity.

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:04.630
He wants to bet so much that
a call is bad, because that's

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:07.020
where his equity comes from.

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:10.760
So he can either bet enough so
that he folds-- the other guy

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:15.510
folds-- or bet enough that he'll
call and make a huge mistake.

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:18.560
Both are equally good.

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:20.752
Actually the second
is probably better.

00:06:20.752 --> 00:06:22.910
AUDIENCE: You're
saying [INAUDIBLE].

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:25.030
PROFESSOR: So I'm saying
a drawer is someone

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:28.120
who has a flush draw
or a straight draw,

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:31.280
or basically has no
real hand at showdown,

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:35.430
but has a reasonable chance
of, as more cards come out,

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:39.034
making a monster hand, like
making a hand which will almost

00:06:39.034 --> 00:06:40.200
certainly win that showdown.

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:45.535
OK, so let's go
through a scenario.

00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:00.840
OK, so this seems
pretty straightforward.

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:02.280
There's some sort
of bet pre-flop.

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:05.240
I called, and it was heads up.

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:08.800
It came with four to a flush,
four hearts, and this guy bet

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:09.550
into me.

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:13.860
And the question
is, what do we do?

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:15.240
That's a big question.

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:17.060
And I'm going to be
using this format a lot

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:19.600
because it's easier
to-- at least for me,

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:22.770
it's easier to see, and then
hopefully it's something

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:24.220
you guys will pick up on.

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:26.229
I'm only going to include
relevant information,

00:07:26.229 --> 00:07:27.770
and the cases are
going to be written

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:30.610
this format where we have
the relevant stacks up here.

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:31.600
Here are the blinds.

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:34.730
This means that small blind
is $20, big blind is $40,

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:36.260
and there's a $10 ante.

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.250
This is a pot before
anyone does anything.

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:40.010
This is a pot as of a flop.

00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:40.960
These are my cards.

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:43.240
The hero is whoever
we care about.

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:45.930
The villain is the other guy.

00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:48.090
And this just shows the
order of what happens.

00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:51.850
So here he raised
to $120 pre-flop.

00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:52.840
Three big blinds.

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:54.120
I call.

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:56.250
The flop comes eight of
hearts, three of hearts,

00:07:56.250 --> 00:07:57.840
something that doesn't matter.

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:00.000
He bets $370, all in.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.910
So my decision is,
what can I do here?

00:08:02.910 --> 00:08:04.960
And this is a really
common scenario.

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:06.600
And what we can do
is develop the tools

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:09.130
that we need to make
this-- to figure out

00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:11.100
what we want to do here.

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:13.180
And rather than
should we call, we

00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:15.950
can come up with a much
more resilient answer.

00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:19.402
What's the biggest
bet that we can call?

00:08:19.402 --> 00:08:21.110
And we're going to
end up with a solution

00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:23.810
set of this, of this area here.

00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:26.330
That's what we
want to figure out.

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:28.120
But first we need
to develop something

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:30.650
called expected value.

00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:34.240
So expected value is the same
in poker as it is in math.

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:36.169
It's just a probability
weighted average

00:08:36.169 --> 00:08:38.380
of all possible results.

00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:41.169
So it's win percentage
times win amount minus

00:08:41.169 --> 00:08:45.520
lose percentage
times lose amount.

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:48.580
So in our scenario, we're going
to add some variables into it.

00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:51.380
We're facing about
into a pot of 380.

00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:55.030
Our EV is going to
be whatever chance

00:08:55.030 --> 00:09:00.220
we have to win times a pot of
380 plus whatever the be is,

00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:05.140
x, minus our lose percentage,
which is 1 minus win percentage

00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:07.160
times that same variable x.

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:11.220
And our threshold for
call is when EV equals 0.

00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:15.570
So pot odds is generally
what we call the relationship

00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:18.880
between the size of
the bet you're facing

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:23.100
and the pot that you would
win if you call that bet

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:24.950
and then win the hand.

00:09:24.950 --> 00:09:28.050
So this is going
to be the equation.

00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:30.140
So it's plus EV.

00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:34.650
It's positive expectation if
the chance you have of winning

00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:39.470
is greater than the call amount
divided by the size of the pot

00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:40.950
after the call.

00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:43.550
So say that we're
seeing a bet of $100.

00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:46.050
We were seeing a bet a little
bit bigger than that, but just

00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:48.390
for example purposes,
we'll use $100.

00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:51.490
So your pot odds
would be $100 divided

00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:55.180
by $580, where $580 is
whatever was in the pot

00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:58.310
before plus his
bet plus your call.

00:09:58.310 --> 00:10:02.050
You'll win $580 if
you win this hand.

00:10:02.050 --> 00:10:07.250
So your call is
contributing 17% of the pot.

00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:09.020
And just so you
guys know, people

00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:10.550
use pot odds in a different way.

00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:16.330
They talk about 1 to 4 and
use a different notation

00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:18.172
for referring to your
chance of winning.

00:10:18.172 --> 00:10:19.880
I always thought this
was very intuitive,

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:21.921
so that's what I'm going
to be teaching you guys.

00:10:21.921 --> 00:10:25.260
It's a percentage of the
pot that you can contribute.

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:28.370
So if your win percentage
is more than 17%,

00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:30.900
this is a plus EV call,
and this should be fairly

00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:33.810
easy to wrap your head around.

00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:35.910
And your win percentage
can just be calculated

00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:38.790
based on what cards will
make you win divided by what

00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:41.370
cards are left in the deck.

00:10:41.370 --> 00:10:42.530
And those are called outs.

00:10:42.530 --> 00:10:46.370
Cards that result in a win for
you based on your best estimate

00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:48.350
are called an out.

00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:52.150
So when you're going for a
flush-- so there are 13 hearts.

00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:53.770
You already know
about four of them.

00:10:53.770 --> 00:10:55.800
They're either in your
hand or on the board.

00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:57.540
There are nine
hearts left that you

00:10:57.540 --> 00:11:01.305
could hit to make your
flush and presumably win.

00:11:01.305 --> 00:11:03.430
So your win percentage--
this is calculating it out

00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:08.490
exactly-- is just 1 minus your
chance of hitting the flush

00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:09.970
on either one of those cards.

00:11:09.970 --> 00:11:12.715
So it's 40 out of
49 times 39 out

00:11:12.715 --> 00:11:16.110
of 48, which is
about equal to 34%.

00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:21.070
So since this 34%, our chance
of winning, is more than 17%,

00:11:21.070 --> 00:11:23.410
the proportion of a call
that we're contributing,

00:11:23.410 --> 00:11:24.570
this makes it a good call.

00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:27.390
And the fact that this is
really big compared to this

00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:29.240
makes it a really good call.

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:32.520
So this is how I think of it
in terms of visualizing it.

00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:38.370
So this whole pie
is the $580 pot

00:11:38.370 --> 00:11:40.330
that it would be if you called.

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:43.970
This chunk is your 34% pot odds.

00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:47.230
Now, this chunk can be
comprised of the size

00:11:47.230 --> 00:11:49.890
of the bet you're
calling and your expected

00:11:49.890 --> 00:11:51.250
value from calling.

00:11:51.250 --> 00:11:56.830
So here, the size of the chunk
is $197, which was 34% of $580.

00:11:56.830 --> 00:11:58.960
We can contribute
up to that amount.

00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:01.080
If we get to
contribute less of it,

00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:03.420
that means that any
additional chunk is EV.

00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:07.450
We are making $97
for making this call.

00:12:07.450 --> 00:12:09.520
Similarly, if we make
a call that's too big,

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:12.120
we end up with a negative
chunk of that pie.

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:15.990
So I'm teaching you a
quick rule for calculating

00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:19.130
your chance of winning any
hand, and the quick rule

00:12:19.130 --> 00:12:22.097
I'm going to use
is by Phil Gordon.

00:12:22.097 --> 00:12:23.430
So let's talk about Phil Gordon.

00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:26.630
So Phil Gordon got-- he
seems like an OK guy.

00:12:26.630 --> 00:12:28.460
He got fourth place
in the main event.

00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:30.440
He won a World Poker tour.

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:32.400
He won two British
championships.

00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:34.330
He's the head referee
of the World Series

00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:35.555
of rock, paper, scissors.

00:12:35.555 --> 00:12:37.430
These guys get into
really interesting things

00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:40.560
when they're not playing
poker, and he's the author Phil

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:41.860
Gordon's Little Green Book.

00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:44.550
So Phil Gordon invented
this thing which

00:12:44.550 --> 00:12:47.340
caught on called Gordon's
rule of two and four,

00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:50.350
which basically just
says each of your outs

00:12:50.350 --> 00:12:54.130
is worth 2% for
each additional card

00:12:54.130 --> 00:12:56.090
you get to see for
that side of the bet.

00:12:56.090 --> 00:12:58.670
And it should be fairly
obvious where 2% comes from.

00:12:58.670 --> 00:13:00.880
It's just 1 divided
by 50, and it's

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:05.920
a rough estimate of what each
out is worth over 49, or 48,

00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:08.660
or however many cards are left.

00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:12.010
If you get to see both the
turn and the river, you use 4%,

00:13:12.010 --> 00:13:14.215
and that's the whole role.

00:13:14.215 --> 00:13:15.840
I'm sure someone
figured it out before,

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:17.631
but he was nice enough
to coin it and write

00:13:17.631 --> 00:13:20.950
in his book, which is why
I'm giving him credit for it.

00:13:20.950 --> 00:13:24.064
So some examples of these
are if you have a low pair

00:13:24.064 --> 00:13:25.730
and you're trying to
get three of a kind

00:13:25.730 --> 00:13:28.574
by the turn or the
river, you have two outs.

00:13:28.574 --> 00:13:29.990
And if you're
trying to figure out

00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:33.280
your chance of making that
three of a kind on the turn,

00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:38.970
you do two outs times 2% for a
total of 4% to make your hand.

00:13:38.970 --> 00:13:41.450
Simple enough.

00:13:41.450 --> 00:13:43.220
Other common examples
are flush draw,

00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:46.350
which should be nine outs
to give you odds of 9

00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:49.810
divided by 47, or about 18%.

00:13:49.810 --> 00:13:51.750
An inside straight
draw is four outs

00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:55.120
to give you odds 4
out of 47, or 8%.

00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:58.150
And you can see this is
the exact calculation,

00:13:58.150 --> 00:14:02.620
but it's really very close
to just multiplying by 2.

00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:04.700
So back to pot odds.

00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:06.550
Your break even is when EV is 0.

00:14:06.550 --> 00:14:10.710
That's a common theme that
we're going to be talking about.

00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:14.090
So the bet is x
into a pot of $380.

00:14:14.090 --> 00:14:17.655
Your chance of hitting the
flush is 9 times 4%, or 36%-ish.

00:14:20.290 --> 00:14:22.400
we're assuming that we
get to see both cards.

00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:25.780
Why do I think we're going
to get to see both cards?

00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:29.110
Because he's all in, and
he can't bet anymore.

00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:31.540
So win percentage is 36%.

00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:34.410
Our exact win rate
is 34%, showing

00:14:34.410 --> 00:14:36.370
that this is pretty close.

00:14:36.370 --> 00:14:39.140
We didn't actually need
to do any heavy math

00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:41.260
to get a good ballpark number.

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:45.286
So the question here is,
we're facing a bet of $370.

00:14:45.286 --> 00:14:49.020
The pot before we
face that bet is $380.

00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:50.810
And the question
is, should we call?

00:14:50.810 --> 00:14:53.350
Because you're not going--
you can solve the threshold

00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:56.980
conceptually just to
get a resilient solution

00:14:56.980 --> 00:14:58.760
set, especially when
you're doing things

00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:02.040
before or after the
fact, but in real time,

00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:04.310
we're going to want a rule
for how to figure this out.

00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:06.226
So let's talk through
this one, and then we'll

00:15:06.226 --> 00:15:08.300
go through the solution
on the next side.

00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:10.660
So we have to figure out
whether to call this.

00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:13.494
So what are we drawing to?

00:15:13.494 --> 00:15:14.660
So we're drawing to a flush.

00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:18.020
So how many cards will
result in a flush here?

00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:18.720
Nine, right.

00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:21.110
So there are nine remaining
hearts in the deck,

00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:23.160
and then we get to
see one or two cards.

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:24.510
AUDIENCE: Two cards.

00:15:24.510 --> 00:15:25.510
PROFESSOR: Yep, I agree.

00:15:25.510 --> 00:15:27.860
So we get to see two
cards because he's all in.

00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:33.730
So our chance of winning is
4% times 9, so 9%, 18%, 36%.

00:15:33.730 --> 00:15:37.280
So we can call up to 36%.

00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:40.340
We can contribute up to
36% of the final pot.

00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:46.470
So we would contribute $370 into
the final pot of 2 times this

00:15:46.470 --> 00:15:48.160
plus 1 times this.

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:49.950
And just offhand,
you can calculate--

00:15:49.950 --> 00:15:51.670
you can figure out
that's around 1/3,

00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:55.670
because the pot is about
equal to the size of his bet.

00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:59.180
So we're contributing a
little bit less than 33%,

00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:01.280
so we know that this is
going to be a good call.

00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:03.500
And that's how you would
do this in real time.

00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:06.690
You'd say you're 36% to win.

00:16:06.690 --> 00:16:11.510
You're contributing 33% of the
pot, so you decide to call.

00:16:11.510 --> 00:16:15.151
And that's how you would
make this decision.

00:16:15.151 --> 00:16:18.300
So let's do a couple
more examples.

00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:19.900
These are all
different situations

00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:21.560
where this type of
thing might come up.

00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:24.820
So here's a situation where
we have asymmetrical stacks,

00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:26.670
although the blinds
are the same.

00:16:26.670 --> 00:16:28.150
So we have six,
seven of diamonds.

00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:30.650
I'm using the four color deck
just to make it easier to see.

00:16:33.170 --> 00:16:35.690
Something happens pre-flop
that doesn't really matter.

00:16:35.690 --> 00:16:39.100
On the flop, there'
$320 in the pot.

00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:40.910
He bets $150.

00:16:40.910 --> 00:16:41.987
So what we do here?

00:16:41.987 --> 00:16:43.070
So what are we drawing to?

00:16:43.070 --> 00:16:44.290
We're drawing to a straight.

00:16:44.290 --> 00:16:46.167
So how many outs do we have?

00:16:46.167 --> 00:16:47.750
How many cards will
hit that straight?

00:16:47.750 --> 00:16:48.592
AUDIENCE: Eight.

00:16:48.592 --> 00:16:49.550
PROFESSOR: Eight, yeah.

00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:53.030
So we got four nines
and then four fours--

00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:54.740
will make us hit that straight.

00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:55.932
So eight outs total.

00:16:55.932 --> 00:16:57.890
So what's our chance of
winning this hand based

00:16:57.890 --> 00:16:59.510
on what we're calling here?

00:16:59.510 --> 00:17:00.890
AUDIENCE: 32%.

00:17:00.890 --> 00:17:02.370
PROFESSOR: Yeah, 8%, 16%, 32%.

00:17:02.370 --> 00:17:04.530
Yep, I agree with that.

00:17:04.530 --> 00:17:08.650
So based on that,
what do we have

00:17:08.650 --> 00:17:11.630
to contribute to
stay in this hand?

00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:14.050
What percentage
of the future pot?

00:17:14.050 --> 00:17:15.702
AUDIENCE: Less than 1/3.

00:17:15.702 --> 00:17:17.410
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
something less than 1/3,

00:17:17.410 --> 00:17:20.710
because if he get exactly
$320, that would be 1/3.

00:17:20.710 --> 00:17:22.859
So we know this is
way less than 1/3,

00:17:22.859 --> 00:17:25.650
and since we're 32% to
win, this is probably

00:17:25.650 --> 00:17:28.000
going to be a good call.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.780
So going through the
questions-- so we

00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:32.090
have an open ended
straight draw, meaning we

00:17:32.090 --> 00:17:34.190
have eight outs because
two different cards

00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:36.340
would result in the straight.

00:17:36.340 --> 00:17:39.250
Our outs are any
nine and any four.

00:17:39.250 --> 00:17:41.750
We have a 33% chance
of hitting it,

00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:43.240
and what's the correct play?

00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:50.180
Call, because $150 out of $620,
where $620 is the pot plus $300

00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:51.840
is 24%.

00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:53.220
OK, so that wasn't bad.

00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:55.010
So those are two common draws.

00:17:55.010 --> 00:17:57.300
One was a flush draw, and
one was a straight draw.

00:17:57.300 --> 00:17:59.920
So let's go to something
a little bit different.

00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:02.880
So we have five
five on the button.

00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:04.870
He raises into us.

00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:10.260
I call, and the flop comes
three clubs, five, ace, six.

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:11.190
He bets $200.

00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:11.820
OK, cool.

00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:17.060
So this is a situation
which I'm sure a lot of you

00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:18.920
may have run into recently.

00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:22.730
So what hand are
we drawing to here?

00:18:22.730 --> 00:18:26.986
Why do we think we're behind
if we have three fives here?

00:18:26.986 --> 00:18:30.610
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
two of clubs [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:33.760
PROFESSOR: Yeah, he might
have a flush, certainly

00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:36.490
to the point where I'm not super
comfortable with the set here

00:18:36.490 --> 00:18:39.690
knowing that it's reasonably
likely for someone

00:18:39.690 --> 00:18:42.380
to have a flush here, or even
if he doesn't have a flush

00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:44.590
and we bet, he's only
going to call us really

00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:47.130
if he has a flush
or a better hand.

00:18:47.130 --> 00:18:49.280
So he has a flush--
what are we drawing to?

00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:50.695
What beats a flush here?

00:18:50.695 --> 00:18:51.570
AUDIENCE: Full house.

00:18:51.570 --> 00:18:52.736
PROFESSOR: Full house, good.

00:18:52.736 --> 00:18:53.330
What else?

00:18:53.330 --> 00:18:56.109
AUDIENCE: Four fives.

00:18:56.109 --> 00:18:57.400
PROFESSOR: Yep, four of a kind.

00:18:57.400 --> 00:18:58.997
OK, so what are our outs here?

00:18:58.997 --> 00:18:59.860
AUDIENCE: Seven.

00:18:59.860 --> 00:19:00.860
PROFESSOR: Yep, I agree.

00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:01.400
Seven outs.

00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:02.152
What are they?

00:19:02.152 --> 00:19:05.030
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:19:05.030 --> 00:19:05.530
Yep.

00:19:05.530 --> 00:19:09.470
So three aces, three
sixes, one five.

00:19:09.470 --> 00:19:11.720
So we have seven outs total.

00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:13.845
So what's our
chance of hitting--

00:19:13.845 --> 00:19:16.555
do we count one
or two cards here?

00:19:16.555 --> 00:19:17.465
AUDIENCE: One.

00:19:17.465 --> 00:19:18.090
PROFESSOR: One.

00:19:18.090 --> 00:19:18.590
Why?

00:19:21.019 --> 00:19:22.560
Because he has a
lot of chips behind,

00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:25.390
and there's no way, if he's
betting this on the flop,

00:19:25.390 --> 00:19:27.839
he's giving us a free
card on the turn,

00:19:27.839 --> 00:19:29.880
unless for some reason he
thinks we have a flash,

00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:32.050
but we certainly
can't count on that.

00:19:32.050 --> 00:19:33.560
OK, so what did we say?

00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:34.370
Seven outs.

00:19:34.370 --> 00:19:38.490
So we use 2% for the
next card, or 14%.

00:19:38.490 --> 00:19:41.810
So we can call up to
14% of the future part.

00:19:41.810 --> 00:19:44.960
The future pot is going
to be $2100, $2300,

00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:48.340
so we can call 14% of that.

00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:52.390
So what's a good
estimate of that?

00:19:52.390 --> 00:19:56.730
It's going to be more than
my 280 because 14% of $2000

00:19:56.730 --> 00:20:00.080
is $280, right?

00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:02.480
So he's betting
materially less than that.

00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:05.710
He's way under betting
whatever he has here.

00:20:05.710 --> 00:20:08.760
If he has a flush,
he's not protecting it.

00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:12.370
If he doesn't have a
flush, he's losing.

00:20:12.370 --> 00:20:16.060
So this is a very common example
of a villain not protecting

00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:17.920
his hand.

00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:20.710
This is a situation where I
see a lot of newer players

00:20:20.710 --> 00:20:21.840
screw up.

00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:24.374
They're betting so little--
they're betting little

00:20:24.374 --> 00:20:26.290
because they don't want
the other guy to fold,

00:20:26.290 --> 00:20:27.690
but they're actually
losing value

00:20:27.690 --> 00:20:30.290
because the other guy folding
here would be preferable.

00:20:30.290 --> 00:20:33.370
They should bet enough that
he either folds or he makes

00:20:33.370 --> 00:20:35.769
a wrong decision if he calls.

00:20:35.769 --> 00:20:38.060
So we're drawing to full
house or four of a kind, which

00:20:38.060 --> 00:20:39.250
you guys got right.

00:20:39.250 --> 00:20:42.616
Our outs are three aces,
three sixes, and one five

00:20:42.616 --> 00:20:44.050
for seven cards total.

00:20:44.050 --> 00:20:50.294
Our chance of hitting the draw
is 14%, so the correct play is?

00:20:50.294 --> 00:20:51.132
AUDIENCE: Call.

00:20:51.132 --> 00:20:52.840
PROFESSOR: Yep, the
correct play is call,

00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:57.430
because he's only asking us for
to contribute 9% of that pot.

00:20:57.430 --> 00:21:00.790
Since we're 14% to win,
the chunk in that pie

00:21:00.790 --> 00:21:03.700
is bigger than the 9% chunk
that we have to contribute,

00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:08.370
and the result is this $122
free that he's giving us.

00:21:08.370 --> 00:21:10.840
OK, so I think this
is my last example.

00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:13.060
This one should be a
little bit more fun.

00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:15.190
So this is it.

00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:18.630
So why is this a draw
that we're looking at?

00:21:18.630 --> 00:21:20.130
We're the first one to act.

00:21:20.130 --> 00:21:23.220
Why does this matter?

00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:25.955
Can anyone tell
what's going on here?

00:21:25.955 --> 00:21:27.440
AUDIENCE: Big blind [INAUDIBLE].

00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:29.240
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
so the villain here

00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:33.340
is all in blind with that $200,
because that's the big blind.

00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:39.120
So by calling here or by doing
anything, he is going all in.

00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:41.910
So really it's like
he acted before us,

00:21:41.910 --> 00:21:44.460
and now we're deciding
whether we want to act.

00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:48.440
So what are we drawing to here?

00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:49.800
What are we facing?

00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:52.609
What does he have
in terms of a range?

00:21:52.609 --> 00:21:53.400
AUDIENCE: Anything.

00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:54.520
PROFESSOR: Any two cards.

00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:57.510
And then so what
are we drawing to?

00:21:57.510 --> 00:22:00.460
In general, we're drawing
to basically anything.

00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:03.320
We're hoping that we win
some amount of the time,

00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:07.110
and what percentage
do we have to win?

00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:09.440
First let's start with
what's a reasonable estimate

00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:14.700
for the amount we could win,
the percentage of the time?

00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:19.760
So what are some hand versus
hand percentages that you know?

00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:23.564
So what's aces versus anything?

00:22:23.564 --> 00:22:24.830
AUDIENCE: 80%.

00:22:24.830 --> 00:22:27.150
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
it's like 80% or 85%.

00:22:27.150 --> 00:22:30.360
And then if he doesn't have a
pocket pair higher than both

00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:34.630
of our cards, you're generally--
even if you're dominated,

00:22:34.630 --> 00:22:38.100
you're like 70/30,
and then the majority

00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:40.780
of random versus
random is between 60/40

00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:43.700
in either direction.

00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:46.840
So say that-- what
percentage of the time

00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:51.674
do we have to win here for
this to be a good call?

00:22:51.674 --> 00:22:53.840
So what's the size of the
bet that we're facing here

00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:54.881
if we're the small blind?

00:22:57.340 --> 00:23:00.010
$100, right?

00:23:00.010 --> 00:23:01.750
So we're contributing
$100 here to win

00:23:01.750 --> 00:23:04.910
a pot of $400, which is
going to be on big blind

00:23:04.910 --> 00:23:06.000
from each of us.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:10.920
So if we're more than 25% to win
here, this is a plus EV call.

00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:13.530
And I see a lot of people
screw this up for some reason,

00:23:13.530 --> 00:23:19.620
but you're virtually
always ahead of 25% here.

00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:22.274
So what we're drawing
to here is anything,

00:23:22.274 --> 00:23:23.690
and our chance of
hitting the draw

00:23:23.690 --> 00:23:26.980
is we're actually about
40% versus his range.

00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:31.160
And even the worst heads up
hand versus any two cards

00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:34.650
is 32%, so we're really
calling blind there.

00:23:34.650 --> 00:23:38.500
We are always
ahead of his range.

00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:40.750
So the correct play is
certainly going to need a call,

00:23:40.750 --> 00:23:42.410
and the EV is like $60.

00:23:42.410 --> 00:23:44.740
So if we fold this, it's
worth about $60 chips.

00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:48.930
So let's talk about
implied out odds.

00:23:48.930 --> 00:23:52.990
So the solution to an
implied odds question

00:23:52.990 --> 00:23:55.280
is the number of
chips that we have

00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:57.570
to win after hitting our draw.

00:23:57.570 --> 00:24:02.790
So I'm using that specific
language because for pot odds

00:24:02.790 --> 00:24:06.120
the solution is whether
or not you can call,

00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:08.770
or what's the maximum
bet you can call.

00:24:08.770 --> 00:24:10.270
For implied odds,
it's different.

00:24:10.270 --> 00:24:12.750
It's the number of chips
you have to win later

00:24:12.750 --> 00:24:14.740
to make the call good.

00:24:14.740 --> 00:24:16.460
It's the amount of
basically dead money

00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:20.860
you need to add to the
pot after the fact.

00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:24.390
So the way that we do that is
we take a look at our percentage

00:24:24.390 --> 00:24:27.170
chance of winning--
say it's 20%--

00:24:27.170 --> 00:24:31.120
and then we figure out what
size would the pot have to be

00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:35.734
to make the bet we are currently
facing be 20% of that pot.

00:24:35.734 --> 00:24:37.900
So here's an example, and
we're using easier numbers

00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:40.870
here because we're
dividing by percentages.

00:24:40.870 --> 00:24:45.200
So say we have a flush
draw and we're 18% to hit.

00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:51.200
If the pot is $300 and we
have a bet of $180 into us,

00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:54.890
our call is going to
be 27% of the pot.

00:24:54.890 --> 00:24:58.090
So if we had a 27% chance of
winning that would be a break

00:24:58.090 --> 00:24:59.400
even call, but we don't.

00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:01.470
We have an 19%
chance of winning.

00:25:01.470 --> 00:25:03.820
So by pot odds, it
says don't call.

00:25:03.820 --> 00:25:06.040
But to figure out
what the amount is

00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:09.180
that we want the
pot to be, we just

00:25:09.180 --> 00:25:12.180
divide that $180 by
the 18% of our odds

00:25:12.180 --> 00:25:14.010
to get this $1000 number.

00:25:14.010 --> 00:25:17.830
So if the part were $1000,
we could make that call.

00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:21.680
So the solution
here is this $340

00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:24.390
difference, which
is the actual part

00:25:24.390 --> 00:25:28.120
after we call-- the difference
between that and the pot

00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:30.430
that we need to make
this call neutral.

00:25:30.430 --> 00:25:33.330
That's where this
$340 comes from.

00:25:33.330 --> 00:25:35.620
And it has to be in dead money.

00:25:35.620 --> 00:25:37.980
It has to be money
that's added to the pot

00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:41.020
after we already hit our flush.

00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:45.930
So to visualize-- so we
need that bet of $180

00:25:45.930 --> 00:25:49.410
from the example I just
gave to be 18% of the pot.

00:25:49.410 --> 00:25:52.860
That's what makes it a good bet.

00:25:52.860 --> 00:25:55.520
As of the time that
we make the decision,

00:25:55.520 --> 00:26:00.376
our bet here represents
27% of that pot.

00:26:00.376 --> 00:26:04.220
However, if we can
increase a pot by $340,

00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:07.540
that bet would be
18% of that new pot.

00:26:07.540 --> 00:26:11.110
So that gives us the right
implied odds to make this call.

00:26:11.110 --> 00:26:14.050
And what we need to figure
out is whether this $340

00:26:14.050 --> 00:26:17.020
number is realistic-- the
difference between this $1000

00:26:17.020 --> 00:26:19.080
and that $660.

00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:20.500
So are we following that?

00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:22.439
Is that making it
easier to understand

00:26:22.439 --> 00:26:24.980
what we're trying to figure out
when we're doing implied odds

00:26:24.980 --> 00:26:25.900
question?

00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:26.787
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:26:26.787 --> 00:26:27.620
PROFESSOR: OK, cool.

00:26:27.620 --> 00:26:31.910
So I think I have two or
three examples here just

00:26:31.910 --> 00:26:34.490
to walk through that idea.

00:26:34.490 --> 00:26:35.660
So here's a hand.

00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:51.300
So here's a decision
we're facing,

00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:53.750
and we need to figure out
whether this is a good call.

00:26:53.750 --> 00:26:55.550
So we have plenty
of chips behind.

00:26:55.550 --> 00:26:59.920
We all started with
$1000, and then we're

00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:03.110
probably not winning this hand
because we have middle pair.

00:27:03.110 --> 00:27:05.630
So we're drawing to two
pair or three of a kind.

00:27:05.630 --> 00:27:10.080
Our outs are these, which
are five outs total,

00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:12.830
which gives us a chance of
hitting our draw of what?

00:27:12.830 --> 00:27:15.270
So do we get to see
one or two cards?

00:27:15.270 --> 00:27:16.792
AUDIENCE: One.

00:27:16.792 --> 00:27:17.500
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:19.000
We get to see one card,
because presumably he's

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:20.030
going to bet again.

00:27:20.030 --> 00:27:23.470
So we multiply by 2% to get a
10% chance of hitting the draw,

00:27:23.470 --> 00:27:27.080
and then let's go back to this.

00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:30.000
So what does the pot
have to be to make

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:33.192
this bet 10% of the future pot?

00:27:33.192 --> 00:27:34.136
AUDIENCE: $1000.

00:27:34.136 --> 00:27:35.327
AUDIENCE: $900.

00:27:35.327 --> 00:27:36.910
PROFESSOR: Well, it
needs to be $1000,

00:27:36.910 --> 00:27:39.870
because we're contributing
$100 of some pot

00:27:39.870 --> 00:27:41.680
that we have 10% equity in.

00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:43.220
So it needs to be
$1000, which means

00:27:43.220 --> 00:27:46.890
how much additional money do we
need to add after we call that?

00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:54.030
So after this call it's
going to be $100, $475, $575,

00:27:54.030 --> 00:27:57.370
because we're calling $100, so
that's going to be in the pot,

00:27:57.370 --> 00:27:57.870
too.

00:27:57.870 --> 00:28:00.610
And then it's the delta
between that and $1000

00:28:00.610 --> 00:28:01.950
that we care about.

00:28:01.950 --> 00:28:06.920
So it's going to be
$1000 minus $575.

00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:11.330
We need to draw $425
in addition at the end.

00:28:11.330 --> 00:28:13.200
So I have a 10%
chance of hitting.

00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:16.760
Our odds are 16%, meaning
we can't call it there.

00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:21.060
However, if we can pull
out that $100 bet divided

00:28:21.060 --> 00:28:24.760
by the 10% odds that we
need, it creates $1000 pot

00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:26.720
with the difference of $575.

00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:31.120
So we need $425 more on
that after we hit our draw

00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:33.767
to make that a good call,
which in that situation

00:28:33.767 --> 00:28:34.475
seems reasonable.

00:28:37.230 --> 00:28:40.030
So he got $100
into a pot of $400.

00:28:40.030 --> 00:28:42.960
Presumably he'll bet like
$200 or $300 next hand,

00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:46.790
and then we can re-pop
him for anything.

00:28:46.790 --> 00:28:49.010
Even if it's a min bet,
which he'll presumably

00:28:49.010 --> 00:28:51.190
be obligated to call,
especially because this

00:28:51.190 --> 00:28:58.800
is a very hidden draw, we'll be
able to make this a good call.

00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:01.970
So I think this is reasonably
a good call based on I

00:29:01.970 --> 00:29:06.660
think we could get $400,
$500 more at least.

00:29:06.660 --> 00:29:09.609
So let's do another
one of these.

00:29:09.609 --> 00:29:12.150
So I'm going to make these all
from the same position and all

00:29:12.150 --> 00:29:13.690
the pre-flop actions
the same just

00:29:13.690 --> 00:29:16.750
to make it simple to
see what's going on.

00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:26.680
OK, so here let's go
through the same steps.

00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:28.401
So what are we drawing to here?

00:29:28.401 --> 00:29:29.442
AUDIENCE: Straight flush.

00:29:29.442 --> 00:29:32.350
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:29:32.350 --> 00:29:33.980
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
so several things.

00:29:33.980 --> 00:29:36.180
So we're drawing to a straight.

00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:37.250
We're drawing to a flush.

00:29:37.250 --> 00:29:39.198
We're drawing to anything else.

00:29:39.198 --> 00:29:40.910
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:29:40.910 --> 00:29:44.240
So, I would agree we're
drawing to a royal flush also.

00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:47.180
And I'm going to say the
over pair might not be good.

00:29:47.180 --> 00:29:49.810
One pair I wouldn't
consider a great hand,

00:29:49.810 --> 00:29:54.970
especially when we're--
what were blinds here?

00:29:54.970 --> 00:29:55.740
$50, $100?

00:29:55.740 --> 00:29:59.480
So we have an m of like $50?

00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:01.110
Something like that.

00:30:01.110 --> 00:30:07.650
So I think our m-- our top
pair is not that great here,

00:30:07.650 --> 00:30:09.280
but I do think
the flush is good.

00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:11.310
Probably like a king
high flush is good,

00:30:11.310 --> 00:30:13.400
and then the straight
is good, too.

00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:14.790
So how many outs
do we have here?

00:30:18.750 --> 00:30:20.730
So how many outs to the flush?

00:30:20.730 --> 00:30:21.954
AUDIENCE: Nine.

00:30:21.954 --> 00:30:24.370
PROFESSOR: Right, so we have
nine other clubs in the deck.

00:30:24.370 --> 00:30:26.294
And then how many
outs to the straight?

00:30:26.294 --> 00:30:27.090
AUDIENCE: Eight.

00:30:27.090 --> 00:30:28.090
PROFESSOR: Eight, right.

00:30:28.090 --> 00:30:30.631
So we have 17 outs, and
then how many are overlaps?

00:30:30.631 --> 00:30:32.554
AUDIENCE: Two.

00:30:32.554 --> 00:30:33.470
PROFESSOR: Two, right.

00:30:33.470 --> 00:30:35.011
So let me make sure
I got that right.

00:30:35.011 --> 00:30:36.715
So 9 plus 8.

00:30:36.715 --> 00:30:37.840
17 Minus 2.

00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:38.970
Yep, 15.

00:30:38.970 --> 00:30:40.090
So we have 15 outs here.

00:30:40.090 --> 00:30:43.422
And then how many cards
are we going to see?

00:30:43.422 --> 00:30:44.320
AUDIENCE: One.

00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:46.329
PROFESSOR: We're
going to see one.

00:30:46.329 --> 00:30:47.870
I really wouldn't
estimate that we're

00:30:47.870 --> 00:30:51.050
going to see two cards, unless
someone is specifically all in.

00:30:51.050 --> 00:30:53.430
So use one card here.

00:30:53.430 --> 00:30:58.150
So we have 15 outs over
one card, so what's

00:30:58.150 --> 00:31:00.666
our percent chance of
winning on that next card?

00:31:00.666 --> 00:31:01.520
AUDIENCE: 30%.

00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:02.670
PROFESSOR: 30%, good.

00:31:06.070 --> 00:31:08.850
So what would the pot
have to be eventually

00:31:08.850 --> 00:31:11.410
to make this a good call with
our 30% chance of winning

00:31:11.410 --> 00:31:12.700
this hand?

00:31:12.700 --> 00:31:18.180
AUDIENCE: $1800?

00:31:18.180 --> 00:31:22.430
PROFESSOR: It would
be-- so I think it

00:31:22.430 --> 00:31:25.540
would be $600 divided by 30%.

00:31:25.540 --> 00:31:26.206
Right?

00:31:26.206 --> 00:31:26.830
So what's that?

00:31:26.830 --> 00:31:29.154
So $600 divided by 3/10.

00:31:29.154 --> 00:31:31.570
No, I think it's going to be
more than that, because we're

00:31:31.570 --> 00:31:34.410
going to multiply by 10/3.

00:31:34.410 --> 00:31:38.110
So it's going to $6000
divided by 3, or $2000.

00:31:38.110 --> 00:31:39.960
Would you agree with that?

00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:41.770
So this pot has to
be $2000 by the end.

00:31:41.770 --> 00:31:45.110
Now, what's it going to
be when we call here?

00:31:45.110 --> 00:31:45.905
AUDIENCE: $1425.

00:31:45.905 --> 00:31:47.030
PROFESSOR: Yeah, let's see.

00:31:47.030 --> 00:31:50.140
So it's going to be $600--
his $600 plus our $600.

00:31:50.140 --> 00:31:52.066
$1200 plus $275.

00:31:52.066 --> 00:31:54.200
Yeah, $1475.

00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:56.780
So how many additional
dollars do we need in the pot

00:31:56.780 --> 00:31:58.540
after hitting one of our draws?

00:31:58.540 --> 00:31:59.662
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:59.662 --> 00:32:00.620
PROFESSOR: Good, right.

00:32:00.620 --> 00:32:02.110
So I think that's right.

00:32:02.110 --> 00:32:04.280
So drawing to straight or flush.

00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:06.140
Any ace, any nine,
seven other clubs

00:32:06.140 --> 00:32:09.120
that aren't ace or
nine for 15 outs.

00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:12.000
We are 30% to hit this.

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:16.210
So right now the pot odds are
40% because he's betting $600--

00:32:16.210 --> 00:32:21.100
or we'd be contributing $600
into a total pot of $1475.

00:32:21.100 --> 00:32:24.540
We need to win an
additional $525 after it

00:32:24.540 --> 00:32:25.810
to make this a good call.

00:32:25.810 --> 00:32:26.440
So that's it.

00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:28.080
So that's how you
do implied odds.

00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:32.060
Just make sure you understand
what the future pot has to be,

00:32:32.060 --> 00:32:34.050
and then you can use
your own judgment

00:32:34.050 --> 00:32:37.350
for whether that's a
realistic amount to win here.

00:32:37.350 --> 00:32:40.700
I think here $500 is
totally reasonable,

00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:42.820
because he already bet $600.

00:32:42.820 --> 00:32:47.770
Even if a flush comes, he's
probably pretty obligated

00:32:47.770 --> 00:32:49.650
to make at least
another a $500 bet

00:32:49.650 --> 00:32:53.020
or at least a $500
call if he checks.

00:32:53.020 --> 00:32:55.890
So I think that's good.

00:32:55.890 --> 00:32:58.290
To make it a little
simpler for you guys,

00:32:58.290 --> 00:33:01.560
I made explicit
all of the formulas

00:33:01.560 --> 00:33:06.850
that we went over for drawing,
just to help with the case.

00:33:06.850 --> 00:33:10.820
So our normal EV formula is
just-- so x is always going

00:33:10.820 --> 00:33:12.270
to be what we're solving for.

00:33:12.270 --> 00:33:16.790
Our EV is just is the either
benefit or cost of the decision

00:33:16.790 --> 00:33:17.890
that we're facing.

00:33:17.890 --> 00:33:21.950
It's just going to be the
combination of our win percent

00:33:21.950 --> 00:33:25.000
and loss percent and the
win amount and loss amount.

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:27.760
How you determine pot odds
is just a decision rule.

00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:30.290
Yes or no-- do you
make this call?

00:33:30.290 --> 00:33:34.350
It's just your win percentage
of the hand-- the chance

00:33:34.350 --> 00:33:36.230
you hitting your
draw, whether that's

00:33:36.230 --> 00:33:40.342
greater than the call amount
divided by the pot plus 2 times

00:33:40.342 --> 00:33:42.800
the call amount, because the
bet amount and the call amount

00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:43.950
are the same thing.

00:33:43.950 --> 00:33:46.590
If it is greater, then
you make the call.

00:33:46.590 --> 00:33:47.920
If it's less than, you fold.

00:33:50.690 --> 00:33:52.926
Implied odds, which we
just went over-- it's

00:33:52.926 --> 00:33:54.300
going to be the
bet amount you're

00:33:54.300 --> 00:33:58.600
facing divided by your chance of
winning the hand minus whatever

00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:01.890
the pot is going to be
after you make that call.

00:34:01.890 --> 00:34:03.106
I think that's it.

00:34:03.106 --> 00:34:04.480
So these are all
the formulas you

00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:06.615
need to make these decisions.

00:34:06.615 --> 00:34:08.989
You can generally remember
them when you're at the table.

00:34:08.989 --> 00:34:13.350
I think they're fairly
intuitive, and if not,

00:34:13.350 --> 00:34:15.090
they seem fairly
easy to memorize.

00:34:15.090 --> 00:34:18.440
Anyway, so let's do a
live example of this.

00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:20.550
So this hand happened at
the World Series of Poker

00:34:20.550 --> 00:34:22.770
last year when it
was 10 handed, which

00:34:22.770 --> 00:34:27.750
means there's it was one hand
before the final table bubble,

00:34:27.750 --> 00:34:30.940
where they get to-- how it works
in the World Series is they

00:34:30.940 --> 00:34:34.780
play down to nine, and then
they have a break for three

00:34:34.780 --> 00:34:36.989
months where they build
up the final table,

00:34:36.989 --> 00:34:39.530
and they advertise it,
and they play it live.

00:34:39.530 --> 00:34:42.110
So this is a situation that
was very tense for these guys,

00:34:42.110 --> 00:34:43.719
and an interesting
had happened which

00:34:43.719 --> 00:34:46.382
I think is a great example
of what we're trying to do.

00:34:46.382 --> 00:34:47.340
Anyway, so let's watch.

00:34:47.340 --> 00:34:47.610

00:34:51.629 --> 00:34:53.670
Champion determined by a
vote of all the players.

00:34:53.670 --> 00:34:55.510
Johnny Moss was the winner.

00:34:55.510 --> 00:34:58.421
Under the gun, Martin
Jacobson, ace, jack of clubs.

00:34:58.421 --> 00:34:59.920
Very accomplished
tournament player.

00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:02.560
Four World Series final tables.

00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:03.255
Raise. $650,000.

00:35:03.255 --> 00:35:04.630
The dealer announces
raise, but I

00:35:04.630 --> 00:35:07.040
don't think Martin has the
right denominations out there.

00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:08.420
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

00:35:08.420 --> 00:35:08.670
Hold the action.

00:35:08.670 --> 00:35:08.840
Hold the action.

00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:09.340
Just call.

00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:10.470
Just a call.

00:35:10.470 --> 00:35:12.964
So they're making it
just a call for $300,000.

00:35:12.964 --> 00:35:14.630
By the way, that was
World Series dealer

00:35:14.630 --> 00:35:16.010
of the year, Andy Tillman.

00:35:16.010 --> 00:35:17.260
Frankly, I think the
dealer of the year thing

00:35:17.260 --> 00:35:18.220
has gone to his head.

00:35:18.220 --> 00:35:19.970
He's dealing with a
lot more attitude now.

00:35:19.970 --> 00:35:21.910
One of these players
will join the likes

00:35:21.910 --> 00:35:24.690
of John Hewitt, Jordan
Smith, and Don Barton

00:35:24.690 --> 00:35:27.780
as main event 10th
place finishers.

00:35:27.780 --> 00:35:30.200
Action on to William Tonking.

00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:32.350
Jack, nine in the small blind.

00:35:32.350 --> 00:35:33.380
He wants to play.

00:35:33.380 --> 00:35:34.470
He limps in.

00:35:34.470 --> 00:35:37.200
In the big blind, Dan
Sindelar checks his option.

00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:39.930
Three for a bargain.

00:35:39.930 --> 00:35:43.380
And here is our flop.

00:35:43.380 --> 00:35:45.390
7, 8, 10, 2 clubs.

00:35:45.390 --> 00:35:47.960
Tonking with a
jack high straight.

00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:51.070
He checks it to Sindelar,
middle pair with a gut shot.

00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:56.180
And he's reaching for
chips, bets a half million.

00:35:56.180 --> 00:35:58.860
Jacobson with flush
and straight draws.

00:35:58.860 --> 00:36:01.430
If Jacobson raises under
the gun as he intended to,

00:36:01.430 --> 00:36:02.930
Tonking likely
would have folded.

00:36:02.930 --> 00:36:05.500
Instead, they're now on a
massive collision course that

00:36:05.500 --> 00:36:08.420
could define the November nine.

00:36:08.420 --> 00:36:10.800
Jacobson obviously
loves his hand

00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:12.040
was straight and flush draws.

00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:14.460
Unfortunately, he's
run into Tonking,

00:36:14.460 --> 00:36:16.930
who flopped a straight,
but there is a raise

00:36:16.930 --> 00:36:18.760
to a $1,750,000.

00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:21.910
So the 2% hand bets, and the
second worst hand raises.

00:36:21.910 --> 00:36:23.410
Lon, this is a game
I need to be in.

00:36:26.050 --> 00:36:28.580
A dream scenario
for the short stack

00:36:28.580 --> 00:36:33.500
that still could turn into a
nightmare for William Tonking.

00:36:33.500 --> 00:36:34.000
All in.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:37.170
And Tonking announces all in.

00:36:37.170 --> 00:36:38.247
Sindelar folds.

00:36:38.247 --> 00:36:38.830
[END PLAYBACK]

00:36:38.830 --> 00:36:40.330
PROFESSOR: So let's figure out
what's going through his head

00:36:40.330 --> 00:36:41.600
right now.

00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:42.920
So here are all our players.

00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:44.580
That's our hero with
ace, jack clubs.

00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:53.569
It's a little hard to see
when they broadcast it on TV,

00:36:53.569 --> 00:36:54.610
but he was under the gun.

00:36:54.610 --> 00:36:57.440
He called.

00:36:57.440 --> 00:36:58.910
Called around.

00:36:58.910 --> 00:36:59.420
He bet.

00:36:59.420 --> 00:37:00.670
He raises.

00:37:00.670 --> 00:37:03.210
He check raises all
in, and now Jacobson

00:37:03.210 --> 00:37:05.710
facing a decision here.

00:37:05.710 --> 00:37:09.720
So clearly, what
is he drawing to?

00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:13.280
Flush, and then if he hits
that flush is he going to win?

00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:14.290
Probably.

00:37:14.290 --> 00:37:15.879
And then what else
is he drawing to?

00:37:15.879 --> 00:37:16.670
AUDIENCE: Straight.

00:37:16.670 --> 00:37:17.530
PROFESSOR: Straight, right.

00:37:17.530 --> 00:37:19.077
And then if he hits
that nine, he's

00:37:19.077 --> 00:37:20.660
probably going to
win with a straight,

00:37:20.660 --> 00:37:22.659
although not all
the time, because he

00:37:22.659 --> 00:37:23.950
doesn't have the best straight.

00:37:23.950 --> 00:37:26.430
If a nine comes
and then this guy

00:37:26.430 --> 00:37:31.590
has queen, king-- or
sorry, jack, queen,

00:37:31.590 --> 00:37:34.422
he's going to actually lose.

00:37:34.422 --> 00:37:36.130
So the question is,
what does he do here?

00:37:36.130 --> 00:37:39.520
This is what it looks like.

00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:42.240
So our hero here raises $1750.

00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:49.040
He re-raises $4525 more
to being all in for $6275.

00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:51.710
So he's drawn to a flush
and possibly a straight.

00:37:51.710 --> 00:37:53.470
So how many outs do we have?

00:37:53.470 --> 00:37:54.980
So you can count partial outs.

00:37:54.980 --> 00:37:57.590
You can say I'm going to win
half the time if I get this,

00:37:57.590 --> 00:37:59.030
just to be conservative.

00:37:59.030 --> 00:38:00.930
So you can say all
these clubs are

00:38:00.930 --> 00:38:03.800
good because you have
the best possible flush,

00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:06.170
and maybe this
nine will work, so

00:38:06.170 --> 00:38:08.460
let's count it as half
a card, half an out.

00:38:08.460 --> 00:38:10.400
We'll win half the
time if we do that.

00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:12.327
So we have 10 and 1/2 outs.

00:38:12.327 --> 00:38:14.660
So our chance of hitting the
draw-- how many cards do we

00:38:14.660 --> 00:38:16.226
get to see?

00:38:16.226 --> 00:38:18.350
AUDIENCE: Why 10 and
1/2? [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:18.350 --> 00:38:22.030
PROFESSOR: Because you can
just say, if we hit this nine,

00:38:22.030 --> 00:38:23.355
we're going win half the time.

00:38:23.355 --> 00:38:25.510
We're probably going
to win more than that,

00:38:25.510 --> 00:38:29.115
but it's a situation where
if he has a jack we split,

00:38:29.115 --> 00:38:31.460
and if he has jack
queen, we lose.

00:38:31.460 --> 00:38:33.880
So I'm not really comfortable
calling those complete outs,

00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:36.750
and in the end, you can see
it doesn't really matter.

00:38:36.750 --> 00:38:38.510
But the more
conservative move is just

00:38:38.510 --> 00:38:40.790
saying half the time
we'll win with those,

00:38:40.790 --> 00:38:43.620
and with these nine outs we're
going to win all the time.

00:38:43.620 --> 00:38:45.230
You can just count
them as half outs,

00:38:45.230 --> 00:38:49.310
or you can count them as 2/3
outs, or something like that.

00:38:49.310 --> 00:38:51.760
Anyway, so we get to see both
cards because he's all in.

00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:52.610
You have a question?

00:38:52.610 --> 00:38:55.514
AUDIENCE: This would
actually be a [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:55.514 --> 00:39:00.416
this will always--
when it's half

00:39:00.416 --> 00:39:04.880
[INAUDIBLE] that the
other person has a jack.

00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:07.854
So under that
condition, [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:07.854 --> 00:39:10.240
under all other conditions
of this [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:10.840
PROFESSOR: No.

00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:13.172
We lose if he has jack, queen.

00:39:13.172 --> 00:39:15.156
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:39:15.156 --> 00:39:18.628
If he has a jack-- he
can have a jack, queen.

00:39:18.628 --> 00:39:20.116
That's fine, but
if he has a jack,

00:39:20.116 --> 00:39:22.767
then it's the 1/2, but
if he does not have

00:39:22.767 --> 00:39:24.690
a jack, then any nine wins.

00:39:24.690 --> 00:39:25.940
PROFESSOR: Yeah, that's right.

00:39:25.940 --> 00:39:27.430
This is a conservative play.

00:39:27.430 --> 00:39:29.262
AUDIENCE: This is
a really-- this

00:39:29.262 --> 00:39:30.640
is the worst case scenario.

00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:31.931
PROFESSOR: Yeah, I would agree.

00:39:31.931 --> 00:39:35.110
If this says call, then
we're definitely calling.

00:39:35.110 --> 00:39:37.950
It's a real pain to have
aggressive estimates,

00:39:37.950 --> 00:39:39.580
and then it says
call, and you need

00:39:39.580 --> 00:39:41.496
to wonder [? why their ?]
estimates are wrong.

00:39:41.496 --> 00:39:44.550
So this gives us a
more clear example.

00:39:44.550 --> 00:39:47.900
Anyway, so the correct play
is going to be to call here.

00:39:47.900 --> 00:39:49.424
It's a little bit
difficult to see,

00:39:49.424 --> 00:39:50.840
but we're going
to say that what's

00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:53.070
in the pot are all
the bets that happened

00:39:53.070 --> 00:39:54.450
before he was re-raised.

00:39:54.450 --> 00:39:57.620
So that's the original
part of $1400,

00:39:57.620 --> 00:40:02.540
that one guy that bet $500 for
some reason, and then this,

00:40:02.540 --> 00:40:08.890
which would be our all in
call, which was the $6275 2,

00:40:08.890 --> 00:40:10.662
because he bet that,
and we called that.

00:40:10.662 --> 00:40:11.620
This was a small blind.

00:40:11.620 --> 00:40:13.170
I don't know if you saw.

00:40:13.170 --> 00:40:16.560
The small blind here
just called $500

00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:19.340
and then folded when
he bet into him,

00:40:19.340 --> 00:40:22.710
so that's dead money in the pot.

00:40:22.710 --> 00:40:25.090
So the total amount
is $14,450, and we're

00:40:25.090 --> 00:40:31.180
facing a bet of $4525, so 31%
of the pot we're contributing.

00:40:31.180 --> 00:40:33.920
We're 42% to hit our
draws, meaning that this

00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:35.290
is a pretty clear call.

00:40:35.290 --> 00:40:40.590
And when we do the EV, even
with this conservative estimate,

00:40:40.590 --> 00:40:44.380
it says we're making
about $1.5 million chips

00:40:44.380 --> 00:40:45.620
for making this call.

00:40:45.620 --> 00:40:47.410
So this should be pretty easy.

00:40:47.410 --> 00:40:49.668
Let's see what happens, and
let's see if this works.

00:40:49.668 --> 00:42:00.960
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:03.300
Boo.

00:42:03.300 --> 00:42:04.124
[END PLAYBACK]

00:42:04.124 --> 00:42:05.040
PROFESSOR: Anyway, OK.

00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:05.790
So he won that.

00:42:05.790 --> 00:42:07.810
The guy, Jacobson,
I'm pretty sure

00:42:07.810 --> 00:42:10.040
ended up winning the
World Series that year.

00:42:10.040 --> 00:42:12.130
OK, so we have a
bunch of be carefuls.

00:42:12.130 --> 00:42:15.110
Do not draw to a hand
that may not actually

00:42:15.110 --> 00:42:16.860
win when you hit it,
which means if you're

00:42:16.860 --> 00:42:19.890
drawing to a flush
that's not even that good

00:42:19.890 --> 00:42:22.130
and maybe dominated
by another flush,

00:42:22.130 --> 00:42:25.670
you probably shouldn't count
all those as full outs,

00:42:25.670 --> 00:42:29.040
or the lower end of a straight
is really, really bad.

00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:31.040
It's really common for
people to draw to that

00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:33.010
and then just go
broke, because they

00:42:33.010 --> 00:42:35.200
think they made their
hand, but as it turns out,

00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:37.780
they made the second best hand.

00:42:37.780 --> 00:42:40.840
In addition, don't draw
out to a worse made hand

00:42:40.840 --> 00:42:42.372
than is already possible.

00:42:42.372 --> 00:42:43.830
So people refer to
something called

00:42:43.830 --> 00:42:47.440
a paired board, which means
two cards on the board

00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:48.315
have the same number.

00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:54.180
That means that four of a kind
or full house are possible.

00:42:54.180 --> 00:42:58.690
So if you're drawn to a straight
or a flush, you might not even.

00:42:58.690 --> 00:43:01.870
You might be-- drawing
dead, is what it's called.

00:43:01.870 --> 00:43:04.310
You like you might be
0% to win that hand,

00:43:04.310 --> 00:43:07.270
so be careful on drawing
on a paired board.

00:43:07.270 --> 00:43:10.010
In addition, do not assume
you get to see both cards.

00:43:10.010 --> 00:43:12.570
It's really common for
players to think that,

00:43:12.570 --> 00:43:14.820
OK, there are two cards left.

00:43:14.820 --> 00:43:16.130
He doesn't seem too aggressive.

00:43:16.130 --> 00:43:18.046
I'll probably get to see
both cards for cheap,

00:43:18.046 --> 00:43:21.990
and then find out that
their assumptions when

00:43:21.990 --> 00:43:26.810
calling the flop ended up being
really bad and costing them EV.

00:43:26.810 --> 00:43:31.450
So very rarely does
someone check the turn.

00:43:31.450 --> 00:43:34.170
Unless the turn is
really scary, like you

00:43:34.170 --> 00:43:36.840
hit your draw obviously,
or it looks like you did,

00:43:36.840 --> 00:43:39.140
no one is was going to
give you that for free.

00:43:39.140 --> 00:43:41.170
Another thing to
be careful about

00:43:41.170 --> 00:43:43.120
is don't overestimate
how easy it

00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:45.250
is to extract additional chips.

00:43:45.250 --> 00:43:48.200
It's really, really obvious
when someone hits a flush draw,

00:43:48.200 --> 00:43:51.250
because there aren't that
many reasons people are going

00:43:51.250 --> 00:43:54.080
to call a bet on the flop
when there are two clubs on it

00:43:54.080 --> 00:43:58.280
and then bet when another
club hits on the turn.

00:43:58.280 --> 00:44:00.460
Flushes are really
obvious and everyone

00:44:00.460 --> 00:44:02.080
is keeping an eye on that.

00:44:02.080 --> 00:44:05.490
Straights are less
obvious because a lot

00:44:05.490 --> 00:44:09.700
of different boards can have
a straight on it so they can't

00:44:09.700 --> 00:44:11.530
really just assume
that you're going

00:44:11.530 --> 00:44:14.970
to have a straight if there are
any like four cards that are

00:44:14.970 --> 00:44:17.020
near each other by the turn.

00:44:17.020 --> 00:44:19.290
And sets, like when
you have a pocket pair

00:44:19.290 --> 00:44:21.760
and you hit a third of
that pair on the turn,

00:44:21.760 --> 00:44:23.140
are basically invisible.

00:44:23.140 --> 00:44:25.180
There's no way they
can put you on that.

00:44:25.180 --> 00:44:27.610
So your implied odds
for sets are huge,

00:44:27.610 --> 00:44:29.890
whereas your implied
odds on flush draws

00:44:29.890 --> 00:44:32.780
are very, very small.

00:44:32.780 --> 00:44:36.150
In addition, on the other
end, if you have a made hand,

00:44:36.150 --> 00:44:41.510
don't bet so little to give them
the odds to reach their draw.

00:44:41.510 --> 00:44:43.630
Basically, most of
your flop and turn bets

00:44:43.630 --> 00:44:46.220
should be like 2/3
of the pot just

00:44:46.220 --> 00:44:52.320
to punish them if they
want to chase their draw.

00:44:52.320 --> 00:44:54.030
OK, so that's it
for implied odds.

00:44:54.030 --> 00:44:56.136
So let's move on to fold equity.

00:44:56.136 --> 00:44:57.010
So here's an example.

00:45:07.810 --> 00:45:10.710
So where you guys following
what was going on in that hand?

00:45:10.710 --> 00:45:15.760
Basically, I had position
pre-flop to make this call.

00:45:15.760 --> 00:45:18.450
Then on the flop I had an
open ended straight draw.

00:45:18.450 --> 00:45:20.800
He be small enough
that I should call.

00:45:20.800 --> 00:45:21.920
Same thing on the turn.

00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:24.270
I think he checked behind me
on the turn, and the river

00:45:24.270 --> 00:45:24.830
he checks.

00:45:24.830 --> 00:45:25.470
Why?

00:45:25.470 --> 00:45:26.920
Why is he checking
the river here?

00:45:26.920 --> 00:45:28.970
So he's checking
because he's worried.

00:45:28.970 --> 00:45:30.970
He knows I'm drawing to
something because I flat

00:45:30.970 --> 00:45:32.052
called, and look.

00:45:32.052 --> 00:45:33.510
I could've been
drawing to a flush,

00:45:33.510 --> 00:45:34.940
and he thinks I just hit it.

00:45:34.940 --> 00:45:36.940
So this is a perfect
bluffing opportunity,

00:45:36.940 --> 00:45:41.620
because we are basically
representing a flush.

00:45:41.620 --> 00:45:43.690
So the question is,
how often does this

00:45:43.690 --> 00:45:46.400
have to work to be a good
bet versus just checking

00:45:46.400 --> 00:45:48.860
behind and losing nothing?

00:45:48.860 --> 00:45:51.190
With bluffing, if
it's a bad bet,

00:45:51.190 --> 00:45:53.670
we're just going to lose
money most of the time.

00:45:53.670 --> 00:45:55.910
So we have to figure out,
what proportion of the time

00:45:55.910 --> 00:45:58.840
does this have to win
to make it worth it?

00:45:58.840 --> 00:46:01.800
And that's what we're going
to be looking at here.

00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:06.200
The concept that will give us
the value of making this bet

00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:08.800
is called fold equity.

00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:11.120
So fold equity is
the value that you're

00:46:11.120 --> 00:46:13.550
getting in a hand
from the likelihood

00:46:13.550 --> 00:46:15.774
that the other player
is going to fold.

00:46:15.774 --> 00:46:17.190
So with regard to
fold equity, I'm

00:46:17.190 --> 00:46:21.160
saying your showdown value,
which is this acronym here,

00:46:21.160 --> 00:46:22.290
is 0.

00:46:22.290 --> 00:46:25.460
You can't win at showdown,
which is our situation there.

00:46:25.460 --> 00:46:29.750
If he calls us, we
definitely, definitely lost.

00:46:29.750 --> 00:46:31.930
So the formula for
this is-- at least

00:46:31.930 --> 00:46:35.370
the EV formula is just-- so it's
a derivation of the normal EV

00:46:35.370 --> 00:46:36.940
formula that we always see.

00:46:36.940 --> 00:46:40.040
It's just the pot times your
chance of winning-- i.e.

00:46:40.040 --> 00:46:43.540
his fold percentage--
minus the chance of losing.

00:46:43.540 --> 00:46:45.330
And you lose that
bet if you lose,

00:46:45.330 --> 00:46:47.480
but your risking the
bet to win the pot.

00:46:47.480 --> 00:46:51.200
If we have the chance
to win after he calls,

00:46:51.200 --> 00:46:53.010
we can add another
variable where

00:46:53.010 --> 00:46:58.330
just, instead of us just losing
this bet for the amount he

00:46:58.330 --> 00:47:00.320
calls of the time,
when he calls,

00:47:00.320 --> 00:47:02.792
we're going to get some
amount of EV, which is still

00:47:02.792 --> 00:47:04.500
presumably going to
be negative, but it's

00:47:04.500 --> 00:47:07.850
going to be a less negative
than just losing the entire bet.

00:47:07.850 --> 00:47:11.790
So that's the basic formula
for semi-bluffing here.

00:47:11.790 --> 00:47:16.020
Some I'm defining
bluffing is a bet

00:47:16.020 --> 00:47:18.750
where it has
positive expectation

00:47:18.750 --> 00:47:22.110
because the fold
equity is more than 0.

00:47:22.110 --> 00:47:25.410
Just this term,
just the proportion

00:47:25.410 --> 00:47:27.910
of the pot that you
expect to win from him

00:47:27.910 --> 00:47:33.390
folding is greater than
the weighted chance

00:47:33.390 --> 00:47:34.914
of you losing that bet.

00:47:34.914 --> 00:47:37.330
That's just going to be called
a bluff, an outright bluff.

00:47:37.330 --> 00:47:39.870
And I differentiate
that from semi-bluffing,

00:47:39.870 --> 00:47:43.040
where this is actually
negative, where

00:47:43.040 --> 00:47:44.860
if you have a 0%
chance of winning,

00:47:44.860 --> 00:47:47.470
it's actually a bad bet,
because he calls you more

00:47:47.470 --> 00:47:49.970
times than makes that valuable.

00:47:49.970 --> 00:47:52.100
But a semi-bluff
actually becomes

00:47:52.100 --> 00:47:55.940
positive expectation because of
your showdown win percentage.

00:47:55.940 --> 00:48:01.140
Your showdown win percentage is
sufficiently high to offset it,

00:48:01.140 --> 00:48:03.060
and this is where
the value comes from,

00:48:03.060 --> 00:48:06.000
because you have the
opportunity to steal pots,

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:10.754
but you also the opportunity
redraw to a winning hand.

00:48:10.754 --> 00:48:12.920
And that's why in tournaments
this becomes something

00:48:12.920 --> 00:48:15.419
that you're going to be doing
very often, because you're not

00:48:15.419 --> 00:48:17.670
going to always have made
hands, but you're always

00:48:17.670 --> 00:48:20.320
going to have something that
could become a made hand,

00:48:20.320 --> 00:48:23.420
and that becomes good enough.

00:48:23.420 --> 00:48:26.300
So how often does this have
to work to be profitable?

00:48:26.300 --> 00:48:29.150
So I'm just going to
give you a formula here.

00:48:29.150 --> 00:48:31.740
So we're betting $150
into a pot of $350 where

00:48:31.740 --> 00:48:34.340
we have no chance of
winning if he calls.

00:48:34.340 --> 00:48:37.030
Our EV, which is just
taking it from that formula,

00:48:37.030 --> 00:48:41.300
is $350 times the chance we
fold minus $150, our bet,

00:48:41.300 --> 00:48:43.190
times the chance he calls.

00:48:43.190 --> 00:48:46.270
So we can solve
this for EV equals 0

00:48:46.270 --> 00:48:48.830
and then solve for fold
to get this formula.

00:48:48.830 --> 00:48:53.100
We get $150 divided by
the pot plus our bet.

00:48:53.100 --> 00:48:54.840
So this is our bet,
because the idea

00:48:54.840 --> 00:48:58.590
is that we are putting $150
into that pot for a chance

00:48:58.590 --> 00:49:00.560
of winning that whole pot back.

00:49:00.560 --> 00:49:04.510
He won't add that $150
to the pot if we win it,

00:49:04.510 --> 00:49:05.830
so that's the idea there.

00:49:05.830 --> 00:49:07.800
So it's our bet
divided by the pot

00:49:07.800 --> 00:49:12.050
after we bet to give us our
neutral EV fold percentage.

00:49:12.050 --> 00:49:14.950
So that's the chance
of him folding

00:49:14.950 --> 00:49:16.510
that makes this a good bet.

00:49:16.510 --> 00:49:19.890
So I think this is pretty cool.

00:49:19.890 --> 00:49:22.040
You can use this to
determine what's a good bluff

00:49:22.040 --> 00:49:24.160
and what's a bad
bluff by just saying,

00:49:24.160 --> 00:49:27.460
is he going to call this
more than 1/3 of the time?

00:49:27.460 --> 00:49:29.340
And just the EV
calculation, looking

00:49:29.340 --> 00:49:34.820
at using this formula to prove
that we reach a neutral EV

00:49:34.820 --> 00:49:40.590
is just 30% times this $350,
the pot minus 70%, him calling,

00:49:40.590 --> 00:49:41.500
times our bet.

00:49:41.500 --> 00:49:42.781
That equals 0.

00:49:42.781 --> 00:49:45.280
And that's our quick-- I like
plugging this back into the EV

00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:48.400
formula just to make
sure we messed around

00:49:48.400 --> 00:49:51.110
with the variables properly.

00:49:51.110 --> 00:49:52.609
So are we OK with this so far?

00:49:52.609 --> 00:49:55.150
Because we're going to move on
to something a little bit more

00:49:55.150 --> 00:49:56.790
complicated.

00:49:56.790 --> 00:49:59.510
In this one, be bet
$75 like he did before,

00:49:59.510 --> 00:50:01.640
but we are raising $150.

00:50:01.640 --> 00:50:04.230
Why?

00:50:04.230 --> 00:50:08.050
Why are we raising $150 here
rather than just calling?

00:50:08.050 --> 00:50:10.595
Yeah, because we have an
open ended straight draw,

00:50:10.595 --> 00:50:13.220
where even if he calls,
we still could win,

00:50:13.220 --> 00:50:16.340
and that fundamentally
changes what we

00:50:16.340 --> 00:50:18.960
need to make this profitable.

00:50:18.960 --> 00:50:21.110
So here, our chance
of winning is 16%.

00:50:21.110 --> 00:50:21.920
8 times 2.

00:50:21.920 --> 00:50:23.420
We get to see just the river.

00:50:23.420 --> 00:50:27.560
So it's $150 into a pot of $350
where our win percent is 16%.

00:50:27.560 --> 00:50:30.410
This is still our chance of
taking now the pot uncontested,

00:50:30.410 --> 00:50:33.870
and then the 1 minus f percent,
the chance that he calls,

00:50:33.870 --> 00:50:37.970
is multiplied by our
marginal EV, this 16% times

00:50:37.970 --> 00:50:39.120
winning the pot.

00:50:39.120 --> 00:50:42.330
$500 is $150 $350--
$150 our bet,

00:50:42.330 --> 00:50:46.510
$350, the pot--
minus $150, our bet.

00:50:46.510 --> 00:50:48.440
I guess a $150 here
would be his bet,

00:50:48.440 --> 00:50:52.830
but still we have a chance
to $500 or lose $150.

00:50:52.830 --> 00:50:55.780
One of the reasons fold
equity is really hard

00:50:55.780 --> 00:50:59.110
to teach is because there's
no real intuitive way

00:50:59.110 --> 00:51:01.090
to memorize this formula.

00:51:01.090 --> 00:51:04.690
So what I did here is I
just solved for EV equals

00:51:04.690 --> 00:51:09.130
0 for our fold percentage.

00:51:09.130 --> 00:51:11.100
So we could solve this--
I just plugged this

00:51:11.100 --> 00:51:14.420
into Wolfram Alpha, and I
got the neutral fold percent

00:51:14.420 --> 00:51:19.600
is just 12%, compared
to here we need

00:51:19.600 --> 00:51:22.050
to win this bluff
30% of the time,

00:51:22.050 --> 00:51:24.040
and here we need to
win 12% of the time.

00:51:24.040 --> 00:51:26.220
That shows the value
of the semi-bluff here.

00:51:26.220 --> 00:51:30.420
So to check with EV, you
win $350 12% of the time,

00:51:30.420 --> 00:51:34.530
and 88% of the time you
have to deal with this.

00:51:34.530 --> 00:51:37.650
So that shows, at
least intuitively,

00:51:37.650 --> 00:51:39.590
what the value is
but let's see if we

00:51:39.590 --> 00:51:44.530
can figure out exactly
how important this win

00:51:44.530 --> 00:51:45.650
percentage is.

00:51:45.650 --> 00:51:51.520
So we're going to have
to use calculus for this.

00:51:51.520 --> 00:51:55.140
So when we graph this
formula, we see a clear trend,

00:51:55.140 --> 00:51:56.590
and it would be intuitive.

00:51:56.590 --> 00:52:00.250
When your showdown win
percentage goes up,

00:52:00.250 --> 00:52:03.410
the amount you need
him to fold goes down.

00:52:03.410 --> 00:52:07.110
If you win 0% of the time,
he needs to fold a lot,

00:52:07.110 --> 00:52:09.030
but then if you win
some amount of the time,

00:52:09.030 --> 00:52:12.280
he only needs to fold a
smaller amount of the time.

00:52:12.280 --> 00:52:13.980
So that's what this
thing is saying.

00:52:13.980 --> 00:52:15.813
And there are a couple
of interesting points

00:52:15.813 --> 00:52:17.550
on this graph which
I want to point out.

00:52:17.550 --> 00:52:21.020
So what's this point here?

00:52:21.020 --> 00:52:25.980
It's our break even fold
percentage for having a 0 EV.

00:52:25.980 --> 00:52:30.420
So the idea is, if he
folds, how you read this is,

00:52:30.420 --> 00:52:32.200
if we have a 16%
chance of winning

00:52:32.200 --> 00:52:35.330
if we're drawing to an open
ended straight for one card,

00:52:35.330 --> 00:52:38.160
if he folds more than
12% percent of the time,

00:52:38.160 --> 00:52:41.586
if we're in anywhere in
this area, it's positive EV

00:52:41.586 --> 00:52:44.220
and for anywhere
down here it's not.

00:52:44.220 --> 00:52:46.310
So that's how we're
reading this graph here.

00:52:46.310 --> 00:52:49.470
So what about this point here?

00:52:49.470 --> 00:52:53.130
It's a complete bluff because
we have 0% chance of winning,

00:52:53.130 --> 00:52:55.310
and you recognize this 30%.

00:52:55.310 --> 00:52:59.510
It's from all the way back here.

00:52:59.510 --> 00:53:02.967
It's when we had a
0% chance of winning.

00:53:02.967 --> 00:53:04.800
So that's that point
up there, which I think

00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:08.497
is pretty interesting,
but it gets even cooler.

00:53:08.497 --> 00:53:09.580
OK so that's what that is.

00:53:09.580 --> 00:53:14.090
It's our $150 divided
by $150 plus $350, which

00:53:14.090 --> 00:53:16.900
is our formula for determining
what our break even

00:53:16.900 --> 00:53:19.100
fold percentage is
for a complete bluff.

00:53:19.100 --> 00:53:22.470
That's our 30% here,
but check this out.

00:53:22.470 --> 00:53:24.790
So what is this number?

00:53:24.790 --> 00:53:26.790
It's our pot odds break even.

00:53:26.790 --> 00:53:28.700
It's the size of the
bet that we could

00:53:28.700 --> 00:53:32.560
call if he was betting
to make us neutral EV.

00:53:32.560 --> 00:53:33.850
That's what this 23% is.

00:53:33.850 --> 00:53:37.750
It's our $150 divided by
the pot after our call.

00:53:37.750 --> 00:53:41.980
What that means is, if
he folds 0% of the time,

00:53:41.980 --> 00:53:44.830
I, similarly, did he
just bet, and then we

00:53:44.830 --> 00:53:46.230
have the option to call.

00:53:46.230 --> 00:53:47.930
That makes a 0 EV.

00:53:47.930 --> 00:53:52.237
So this graph connects all
of those variables for us,

00:53:52.237 --> 00:53:54.320
and that lets us derive
something very interesting

00:53:54.320 --> 00:53:56.080
with regard to implied odds.

00:53:56.080 --> 00:53:58.890
We could just figure out
how implied odds impacts

00:53:58.890 --> 00:54:01.662
our fold percentage by
looking at this secant line

00:54:01.662 --> 00:54:03.120
and coming up with
a good estimate.

00:54:03.120 --> 00:54:04.746
So let me work through
this graph, talk

00:54:04.746 --> 00:54:06.453
through what we're
seeing here, because I

00:54:06.453 --> 00:54:07.720
think this is really cool.

00:54:07.720 --> 00:54:15.290
So to be clear, this blue line
is our neutral fold percentage,

00:54:15.290 --> 00:54:19.060
and then this slope
is-- it's the derivative

00:54:19.060 --> 00:54:23.920
of how much of a bonus
we get to fold percentage

00:54:23.920 --> 00:54:25.920
for every 1% win rate.

00:54:25.920 --> 00:54:29.390
So for each additional one
out, each additional 2%,

00:54:29.390 --> 00:54:33.087
he needs the fold 3% less
for us to break even there.

00:54:33.087 --> 00:54:34.420
That's what this is telling you.

00:54:34.420 --> 00:54:38.090
When you have a 10%
chance of winning,

00:54:38.090 --> 00:54:44.080
you just reduce
this amount by 15%.

00:54:44.080 --> 00:54:46.040
You multiply it by the
one and a half slope.

00:54:46.040 --> 00:54:48.320
Although it undershoots
it by a little bit,

00:54:48.320 --> 00:54:50.200
it gives you a very,
very close estimate

00:54:50.200 --> 00:54:55.330
to using these implied
odds in real time.

00:54:55.330 --> 00:54:57.350
And then so I went
ahead and figured out,

00:54:57.350 --> 00:55:00.250
OK, so that's for a
specific bet size.

00:55:00.250 --> 00:55:03.330
How's it work if we look at
for a much bigger bet or a much

00:55:03.330 --> 00:55:04.160
smaller bet?

00:55:04.160 --> 00:55:06.300
I found something
really interesting.

00:55:06.300 --> 00:55:09.700
When the bet becomes-- when
we go towards infinity,

00:55:09.700 --> 00:55:11.780
the partial derivative is 2.

00:55:11.780 --> 00:55:16.450
You only get as much of a bonus
as 2 times your win percentage.

00:55:16.450 --> 00:55:19.160
So each additional out
gives you like 8% percent

00:55:19.160 --> 00:55:23.300
reduced in break even
for fold percentage.

00:55:23.300 --> 00:55:25.550
And then when your
bet approaches 0,

00:55:25.550 --> 00:55:27.740
you only get a 1% decrease.

00:55:27.740 --> 00:55:30.530
So these are our bounds.

00:55:30.530 --> 00:55:34.740
For a pot size bet, it's
1.5% percent your bonus,

00:55:34.740 --> 00:55:37.920
and regardless,
you know your bonus

00:55:37.920 --> 00:55:40.030
is going to be between
1 and 2, at least

00:55:40.030 --> 00:55:43.810
in terms of the average
across win percentages.

00:55:43.810 --> 00:55:45.180
That's what we discovered here.

00:55:45.180 --> 00:55:46.850
And what this is
letting us do is

00:55:46.850 --> 00:55:48.920
it's less letting us
create a quick rule that

00:55:48.920 --> 00:55:51.170
implements implied odds.

00:55:51.170 --> 00:55:55.680
So to go over what
these rules exactly are,

00:55:55.680 --> 00:55:58.300
let's back up to
a complete bluff.

00:55:58.300 --> 00:56:02.160
So our fold needed
is just the bet

00:56:02.160 --> 00:56:06.280
divided by the pot
and the bet combined.

00:56:06.280 --> 00:56:09.130
If you want to bet the
exact size of the pot, which

00:56:09.130 --> 00:56:13.180
isn't that bad for a bluff, you
only need to win half the time.

00:56:13.180 --> 00:56:16.870
And then you can, if you want,
scale linearly down to 0.

00:56:16.870 --> 00:56:20.360
You could just say, all
right, if I bet half the pot,

00:56:20.360 --> 00:56:22.264
I have to win 25% of the time.

00:56:22.264 --> 00:56:23.180
It's a little bit off.

00:56:23.180 --> 00:56:26.135
It's like 33% of the time,
but it's not that bad.

00:56:26.135 --> 00:56:27.510
So this gives you
a very easy way

00:56:27.510 --> 00:56:30.240
to determine when you
should bluff or not,

00:56:30.240 --> 00:56:32.035
and obviously there's
a bit of judgment

00:56:32.035 --> 00:56:33.910
because you've got to
figure out whether this

00:56:33.910 --> 00:56:36.700
is a reasonable number, but
it gives you idea of you

00:56:36.700 --> 00:56:40.030
don't need to win that
bluff 80% of the time.

00:56:40.030 --> 00:56:43.650
And then when you actually
have a chance to redraw to win,

00:56:43.650 --> 00:56:46.720
it becomes even
more interesting.

00:56:46.720 --> 00:56:51.410
So in general, when
you have a draw,

00:56:51.410 --> 00:56:53.085
your value is higher
because you still

00:56:53.085 --> 00:56:54.870
have a chance to win the hand.

00:56:54.870 --> 00:56:57.690
And in general, you're going
to see very rarely will people

00:56:57.690 --> 00:57:03.000
actually make complete bluffs,
because they would prefer--

00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:04.990
the chance of you winning
the hand at the end

00:57:04.990 --> 00:57:08.700
materially makes
your value better.

00:57:08.700 --> 00:57:11.900
So a simple assumption
is just each 1%

00:57:11.900 --> 00:57:16.730
your showdown increases you
decrease your fold percentage

00:57:16.730 --> 00:57:18.300
by 1.5%.

00:57:18.300 --> 00:57:20.940
And your fold percentage are
going to be much, much smaller.

00:57:20.940 --> 00:57:24.180
They're going to be like
15% to 20-ish percent,

00:57:24.180 --> 00:57:25.470
somewhere in that range.

00:57:25.470 --> 00:57:27.780
So decreasing that
by 5% actually makes

00:57:27.780 --> 00:57:31.630
you quite a bit more
likely to win, or at least

00:57:31.630 --> 00:57:34.407
have a positive
expectation decision.

00:57:34.407 --> 00:57:35.990
And when we talk
about pre-flop, which

00:57:35.990 --> 00:57:37.614
is going to be nothing
but figuring out

00:57:37.614 --> 00:57:41.120
semi-bluffing
opportunities, we're

00:57:41.120 --> 00:57:45.530
going to be heavily
using this type of thing.

00:57:45.530 --> 00:57:47.625
So let's do some examples.

00:58:07.240 --> 00:58:09.000
OK, so what is going on here?

00:58:12.440 --> 00:58:15.570
So just to watch
that again-- so it

00:58:15.570 --> 00:58:18.470
looks like the villain
raised something pre-flop.

00:58:18.470 --> 00:58:19.770
I had position, so I called.

00:58:24.740 --> 00:58:29.100
And then he showed weakness
for three straights in a row,

00:58:29.100 --> 00:58:31.750
I don't know what he has,
but it seems to be worth

00:58:31.750 --> 00:58:33.020
taking a stab at it.

00:58:33.020 --> 00:58:34.590
So then what
proportion of the time

00:58:34.590 --> 00:58:38.060
does this step have to work
to make it a good bluff?

00:58:38.060 --> 00:58:40.750
So is this going to be
bluff or a semi-bluff?

00:58:40.750 --> 00:58:41.470
AUDIENCE: Bluff.

00:58:41.470 --> 00:58:41.780
PROFESSOR: Bluff.

00:58:41.780 --> 00:58:42.615
Why?

00:58:42.615 --> 00:58:43.770
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:58:43.770 --> 00:58:47.480
PROFESSOR: Yeah, I
barely beat the board.

00:58:47.480 --> 00:58:52.030
I think my 10 high plays,
but only very close.

00:58:52.030 --> 00:58:56.250
So there's no way he can call
this with the worse hand.

00:58:56.250 --> 00:58:58.590
So the question is,
how often does this

00:58:58.590 --> 00:59:00.110
have to work to be valuable?

00:59:00.110 --> 00:59:03.560
Which is a very common question
you might ask yourself.

00:59:03.560 --> 00:59:05.310
So do you remember how
to figure this out?

00:59:09.770 --> 00:59:13.000
So the formula is
going to be this.

00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:16.210
It's just the bet divided
by the pot plus the bet.

00:59:16.210 --> 00:59:18.440
So difference between this
and the pot odds formula

00:59:18.440 --> 00:59:19.850
is one bet.

00:59:19.850 --> 00:59:23.790
Pot odds formulas is pot
plus two bets, ours and his.

00:59:23.790 --> 00:59:25.860
This formula is just
the pot plus our bet

00:59:25.860 --> 00:59:29.560
only, because he
never adds his bet in.

00:59:29.560 --> 00:59:31.740
So to figure out our
chance of winning here,

00:59:31.740 --> 00:59:34.080
let's just go to this one.

00:59:34.080 --> 00:59:35.280
We just do what?

00:59:35.280 --> 00:59:37.150
We take this side of
our bet and divide it

00:59:37.150 --> 00:59:39.420
by this plus this number.

00:59:39.420 --> 00:59:41.458
So we add those
together, it's what?

00:59:41.458 --> 00:59:43.200
$625.

00:59:43.200 --> 00:59:47.380
So we'd just take $250 divided
by $625, which is what?

00:59:47.380 --> 00:59:48.250
It's 40%.

00:59:48.250 --> 00:59:50.630
So this needs to work 40%
of the time to be valuable.

00:59:50.630 --> 00:59:53.520
So it's actually
not as interesting

00:59:53.520 --> 00:59:54.520
as I would have guessed.

00:59:54.520 --> 00:59:57.120
This needs to work a
pretty big amount of time.

00:59:57.120 --> 00:59:59.980
And given that he's
shown so much weakness,

00:59:59.980 --> 01:00:02.170
he's probably guessing that
we're probably buffing.

01:00:02.170 --> 01:00:06.710
But anyway, if he
calls 25% of the time,

01:00:06.710 --> 01:00:11.220
does that make that
a good bet or not?

01:00:11.220 --> 01:00:13.570
Yes, because that
means he folds 75%

01:00:13.570 --> 01:00:16.230
of the time, which
is more than our 40%.

01:00:16.230 --> 01:00:17.840
So that makes that a good bet.

01:00:17.840 --> 01:00:21.230
And just to plug into
the EV formula, what

01:00:21.230 --> 01:00:24.680
is our value from this bluff
if our estimate is right here

01:00:24.680 --> 01:00:27.240
that he calls 25% of the time?

01:00:27.240 --> 01:00:30.890
It's $200, so the pot is what?

01:00:30.890 --> 01:00:34.390
I think the pot is $400 here.

01:00:34.390 --> 01:00:37.942
So that makes sense to
me that 75% of the time

01:00:37.942 --> 01:00:40.400
we're going to take down that
pot, so it's worth about $200

01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:40.900
to us.

01:00:43.740 --> 01:00:45.979
So that's it.

01:00:45.979 --> 01:00:47.020
Let's do another example.

01:01:03.130 --> 01:01:04.850
OK, so what's going on?

01:01:04.850 --> 01:01:07.710
Something happened
on the flop, and then

01:01:07.710 --> 01:01:08.680
what are we doing here?

01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:09.769
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:01:09.769 --> 01:01:10.560
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:15.210
So we're betting $450
into a pot of $775.

01:01:15.210 --> 01:01:19.690
So the question is,
is this a good bet?

01:01:19.690 --> 01:01:21.270
Should we have done this?

01:01:21.270 --> 01:01:23.530
And we're going to be
facing these decisions

01:01:23.530 --> 01:01:26.130
all throughout the tournament.

01:01:26.130 --> 01:01:32.960
So this one is going to be kind
of complicated, but not really.

01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:34.840
Let's see what we can
piece together for now.

01:01:34.840 --> 01:01:37.605
So what's our chance of
winning this one at showdown?

01:01:40.270 --> 01:01:41.924
So we have 16%
chance of winning.

01:01:41.924 --> 01:01:42.840
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:01:45.750 --> 01:01:49.590
PROFESSOR: It's hard to--
I prefer not counting--

01:01:49.590 --> 01:01:52.810
you can proportion partial
outs to whatever you think

01:01:52.810 --> 01:01:55.270
your real chance of winning
if you hit that is-- say,

01:01:55.270 --> 01:01:56.676
that's worth 1/3 of an out.

01:01:56.676 --> 01:01:58.550
But in terms of being
conservative and making

01:01:58.550 --> 01:02:00.280
this simple, we
could just say, let's

01:02:00.280 --> 01:02:02.100
say we have to hit
the straight to win,

01:02:02.100 --> 01:02:04.350
although you can consider
yourself having a little bit

01:02:04.350 --> 01:02:06.180
more equity if
you just say maybe

01:02:06.180 --> 01:02:10.290
I'll win if I hit
a 10 or something.

01:02:10.290 --> 01:02:15.260
So we're betting for $450
into this pot of $775.

01:02:15.260 --> 01:02:18.540
So we know we have a 16%
chance of winning this hand

01:02:18.540 --> 01:02:20.360
if we are called.

01:02:20.360 --> 01:02:25.330
If we have no percent
chance of winning the hand

01:02:25.330 --> 01:02:27.710
if we are called, what
proportion of the time

01:02:27.710 --> 01:02:30.300
do we need him to fold
to make this good?

01:02:30.300 --> 01:02:32.610
$450 divided by $1225.

01:02:32.610 --> 01:02:38.310
That $1225 is going
to be $450 plus $775.

01:02:38.310 --> 01:02:39.170
Is that right?

01:02:39.170 --> 01:02:40.970
What was the bet?

01:02:40.970 --> 01:02:47.230
Yeah, $450 plus $775 $1225.

01:02:47.230 --> 01:02:50.690
I think this is-- $11-- $1225.

01:02:50.690 --> 01:02:53.760
I think that's right.

01:02:53.760 --> 01:02:54.420
$1225?

01:02:54.420 --> 01:02:59.380
OK, so we have a 37% chance
of-- that's our break

01:02:59.380 --> 01:03:01.080
even if we have no
chance of winning,

01:03:01.080 --> 01:03:05.120
but then we get a bonus for
the 16% chance of us winning,

01:03:05.120 --> 01:03:07.900
and then a general estimate
is going to be 1.5 times,

01:03:07.900 --> 01:03:10.060
because we're making
approximately a pot size bet.

01:03:10.060 --> 01:03:11.560
We're making it a
little bit smaller

01:03:11.560 --> 01:03:13.660
so maybe this is over
doing it by a little bit,

01:03:13.660 --> 01:03:16.010
but this is at least
giving us an OK estimate.

01:03:16.010 --> 01:03:17.190
This might be a little low.

01:03:17.190 --> 01:03:20.340
It might be like 18%, but
we can't differentiate

01:03:20.340 --> 01:03:23.580
between a margin that small.

01:03:23.580 --> 01:03:27.030
So the 60% chance is related
to our chance of winning.

01:03:27.030 --> 01:03:28.860
We get a bonus that's
proportional to that.

01:03:28.860 --> 01:03:33.810
I'm saying 1.5, which seem
to be about in the ballpark,

01:03:33.810 --> 01:03:37.580
to give me 13% chance break
even for that fold rate.

01:03:37.580 --> 01:03:42.240
So even if he calls 80% of the
time, it makes it a good bet,

01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:45.600
and 80% is a huge
amount considering--

01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:47.055
I don't remember the situation.

01:03:50.360 --> 01:03:52.390
He could potentially
have nothing here.

01:03:52.390 --> 01:03:54.200
He definitely showed
some sort of weakness,

01:03:54.200 --> 01:03:58.790
so it's totally reasonable that
he won't call more than 80%

01:03:58.790 --> 01:03:59.540
of the time there.

01:04:02.300 --> 01:04:05.260
So we calculate our equity just
based on the formula earlier,

01:04:05.260 --> 01:04:09.190
which is our chance of taking
the pot down uncontested, 20%.

01:04:09.190 --> 01:04:13.600
And then our 80% chance
of winning 60% of the time

01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:15.195
and losing 84% of
the time, where

01:04:15.195 --> 01:04:19.920
we're winning the pot plus his
bet, and we're losing our bet.

01:04:19.920 --> 01:04:22.684
OK, so let's jump to
another live example.

01:04:22.684 --> 01:04:23.350
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

01:04:23.350 --> 01:04:25.460
Junior world champion
bowling and horseshoes

01:04:25.460 --> 01:04:27.401
for [INAUDIBLE],
Foosball, and maybe poker.

01:04:27.401 --> 01:04:28.400
Sorry, what's your name?

01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:29.674
Mark.

01:04:29.674 --> 01:04:31.250
[INAUDIBLE]

01:04:31.250 --> 01:04:34.610
Mark already plays this
final table [INAUDIBLE].

01:04:34.610 --> 01:04:37.611
I've heard-- sorry.

01:04:37.611 --> 01:04:38.235
I have no idea.

01:04:38.235 --> 01:04:40.360
Listen, Billy is a world
champion in another sport.

01:04:40.360 --> 01:04:42.026
PROFESSOR: That guy
is pretty cool, too.

01:04:42.026 --> 01:04:43.574
What sport?
[INAUDIBLE] Foosball.

01:04:43.574 --> 01:04:44.487
Yeah?

01:04:44.487 --> 01:04:44.987
Yeah.

01:04:44.987 --> 01:04:46.737
Well, that's pretty
awesome, as well, huh?

01:04:46.737 --> 01:04:48.410
Yeah, that is awesome.

01:04:48.410 --> 01:04:50.660
PROFESSOR: This is considered
very high quality banter

01:04:50.660 --> 01:04:51.880
by poker standards.

01:04:51.880 --> 01:04:54.237
[INAUDIBLE]

01:04:54.237 --> 01:04:54.820
Secret is out.

01:04:54.820 --> 01:04:56.803
Absolutely.

01:04:56.803 --> 01:04:59.208
Jacobson, pocket sevens.

01:04:59.208 --> 01:05:01.960
$650.

01:05:01.960 --> 01:05:03.310
Confirming with [INAUDIBLE].

01:05:03.310 --> 01:05:06.620
Yeah, that's $650,
and that's a raise.

01:05:06.620 --> 01:05:08.820
Politano, 10 trey
suited. [INAUDIBLE]

01:05:08.820 --> 01:05:10.880
to Pappas now with ace, queen.

01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:13.495
I wonder if there are
different surfaces of Foosball,

01:05:13.495 --> 01:05:14.870
like the French
open of Foosball,

01:05:14.870 --> 01:05:16.710
the Wimbledon of Foosball.

01:05:16.710 --> 01:05:18.400
And is there an ace,
queen in foosball?

01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:18.900
Yeah, right.

01:05:18.900 --> 01:05:20.250
PROFESSOR: The wort joke ever.

01:05:20.250 --> 01:05:22.320
Several brands of
championship tables.

01:05:22.320 --> 01:05:24.492
Billy's a tornado
guy, by the way.

01:05:24.492 --> 01:05:26.830
Tornado.

01:05:26.830 --> 01:05:31.290
Billy, with ace, queen re-raised
to $1 million $425,000.

01:05:31.290 --> 01:05:33.130
The main event is a
grind, but Billy Pappas

01:05:33.130 --> 01:05:34.921
says he doesn't get
tired here because he's

01:05:34.921 --> 01:05:37.620
used to Foosball tournaments,
which are 14 hours a day

01:05:37.620 --> 01:05:40.280
on your feet for several days.

01:05:40.280 --> 01:05:41.820
[? And ?] [INAUDIBLE] folds.

01:05:41.820 --> 01:05:43.195
The ace of hearts is exposed.

01:05:47.710 --> 01:05:49.330
Back to Jacobson.

01:05:49.330 --> 01:05:51.092
Jacobson trying to
become the first Swede

01:05:51.092 --> 01:05:53.050
to make the main event
final tables since Chris

01:05:53.050 --> 01:05:54.790
Bjorin in 1997.

01:05:54.790 --> 01:05:57.980
Bjorin tied for sixth all time
in the World Series caches.

01:05:57.980 --> 01:06:00.370
Bjorin and Jacobson
both born in Sweden.

01:06:00.370 --> 01:06:02.166
Both moved to London.

01:06:02.166 --> 01:06:03.620
Jacobson made the call.

01:06:03.620 --> 01:06:06.100
We're heads up.

01:06:06.100 --> 01:06:08.260
King, jack, trey.

01:06:08.260 --> 01:06:09.990
Jacobson ahead so in the sevens.

01:06:09.990 --> 01:06:11.540
Pappas picks up a Broadway draw.

01:06:11.540 --> 01:06:12.402
Jacobson checks.

01:06:12.402 --> 01:06:12.985
[END PLAYBACK]

01:06:12.985 --> 01:06:14.610
PROFESSOR: So Let's
take a look at what

01:06:14.610 --> 01:06:17.830
actually happened before
we got to where we paused.

01:06:17.830 --> 01:06:19.450
So this guy's in position.

01:06:19.450 --> 01:06:22.180
He's in the cut off position.

01:06:22.180 --> 01:06:24.030
Jacobson raises.

01:06:24.030 --> 01:06:26.820
He re-pops with ace,
queen in position.

01:06:26.820 --> 01:06:30.015
Newhouse throws out an
ace for some reason.

01:06:30.015 --> 01:06:31.390
So Jacobson checks,
and then he's

01:06:31.390 --> 01:06:32.780
going to make the standard bet.

01:06:32.780 --> 01:06:35.510
So the question is,
is this a good bet?

01:06:35.510 --> 01:06:38.050
And then something we
can definitely figure out

01:06:38.050 --> 01:06:40.290
is what percentage
of the time does

01:06:40.290 --> 01:06:44.340
this have to be a fold
to make this a good bet.

01:06:44.340 --> 01:06:46.860
If showdown win
percentage is 0, it's

01:06:46.860 --> 01:06:53.620
going to be $1800 divided by the
pot plus $1800, his bet-- 33%.

01:06:53.620 --> 01:06:55.730
But if he actually has
a chance of winning--

01:06:55.730 --> 01:06:57.060
he has an inside straight draw.

01:06:57.060 --> 01:07:02.240
He has a 10, and then he has
the best possible straight.

01:07:02.240 --> 01:07:07.800
He gets up 8% of the time,
reducing his break even fold

01:07:07.800 --> 01:07:09.565
percentage by approximately 8%.

01:07:09.565 --> 01:07:12.620
So it's 8 times 1.5, 12.

01:07:12.620 --> 01:07:15.420
So this minus 12 is at 21%.

01:07:15.420 --> 01:07:17.160
And then this is
solving it out exactly.

01:07:17.160 --> 01:07:19.350
I gave them half
outs for an ace.

01:07:19.350 --> 01:07:21.830
Maybe ace wins 1/2 the time.

01:07:21.830 --> 01:07:25.520
It turns out that 21%
is basically dead on.

01:07:25.520 --> 01:07:26.970
So let's see what happened.

01:07:26.970 --> 01:07:27.750
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

01:07:27.750 --> 01:07:30.040
King, jack, trey.

01:07:30.040 --> 01:07:31.967
Jacobson ahead so
with the sevens.

01:07:31.967 --> 01:07:33.300
Pappas picks up a Broadway draw.

01:07:33.300 --> 01:07:34.305
Jacobson checks.

01:07:34.305 --> 01:07:37.100
Of course Bruno Politano trying
to become the first Brazilian

01:07:37.100 --> 01:07:38.400
to make main event final table.

01:07:38.400 --> 01:07:38.979
[INAUDIBLE]

01:07:38.979 --> 01:07:40.270
What happened to the Canadians?

01:07:40.270 --> 01:07:44.230
Our record ten
[INAUDIBLE] since 2013.

01:07:44.230 --> 01:07:45.850
Non grata Canadian.

01:07:45.850 --> 01:07:48.430
I think they got too cocky.

01:07:48.430 --> 01:07:52.349
And now Pappas comes out
with a draw for $1.8.

01:07:52.349 --> 01:07:54.640
Pappas was rather aggressive
earlier in the main event,

01:07:54.640 --> 01:07:56.570
again showing his
aggressive side right now.

01:07:56.570 --> 01:07:57.390
Martin folds.

01:07:57.390 --> 01:07:59.010
Pappas will drag the pot.

01:07:59.010 --> 01:08:01.610
Now he's sits just
shy of $20 million.

01:08:01.610 --> 01:08:03.680
A world champ in
two different games?

01:08:03.680 --> 01:08:07.680
It just could very well be.

01:08:07.680 --> 01:08:10.940
Billy Pappas makes good
use of that scary boarded

01:08:10.940 --> 01:08:12.347
take down the pot.

01:08:12.347 --> 01:08:12.930
[END PLAYBACK]

01:08:12.930 --> 01:08:14.980
PROFESSOR: OK, so that's
a very common type of bet,

01:08:14.980 --> 01:08:15.840
which we'll talk about later.

01:08:15.840 --> 01:08:17.500
That's called a
continuation bet.

01:08:17.500 --> 01:08:19.510
So he showed
aggression pre-flop.

01:08:19.510 --> 01:08:21.310
It's checked him on the flop.

01:08:21.310 --> 01:08:23.520
It's almost always going
to be the right move

01:08:23.520 --> 01:08:26.930
to bet again on the flop,
because you're already

01:08:26.930 --> 01:08:28.490
indicating that you
have a good hand,

01:08:28.490 --> 01:08:30.660
and then two face cards show up.

01:08:30.660 --> 01:08:32.229
It's reasonably
likely that you're

01:08:32.229 --> 01:08:33.930
going to have at
least top pair there,

01:08:33.930 --> 01:08:36.779
so it's uncommon
for the other guy

01:08:36.779 --> 01:08:40.680
to try to push up against
you since presumably you

01:08:40.680 --> 01:08:43.439
have at least a pair of kings
or jacks most of the time.

01:08:46.037 --> 01:08:47.370
Let's do some be careful abouts.

01:08:50.600 --> 01:08:53.069
This is a lot of stuff
I notice from the more

01:08:53.069 --> 01:08:54.069
recent tournaments.

01:08:54.069 --> 01:08:56.160
So don't bet too
little on a bluff.

01:08:56.160 --> 01:08:57.720
That makes it very
obvious, and then

01:08:57.720 --> 01:09:00.890
it's usually pretty
clear-- if you

01:09:00.890 --> 01:09:04.960
bet 1/3 of the pot, which is
something that's generally not

01:09:04.960 --> 01:09:08.880
common for normal
players, it kind of

01:09:08.880 --> 01:09:12.540
screams that you're not
too attached to the hand.

01:09:12.540 --> 01:09:14.490
And a 2/3 of the
pot bet only really

01:09:14.490 --> 01:09:17.279
needs to win a small percentage
of time to be profitable.

01:09:17.279 --> 01:09:19.670
I get the no one likes
to lose money on a bluff,

01:09:19.670 --> 01:09:26.290
but 1/3 bet works much less
of the time than a 2/3,

01:09:26.290 --> 01:09:29.229
and you actually get much
less value out of it.

01:09:29.229 --> 01:09:30.560
So bet enough.

01:09:30.560 --> 01:09:32.050
Bet like you had a normal hand.

01:09:32.050 --> 01:09:34.540
Bet enough that, if someone
is drawing to something,

01:09:34.540 --> 01:09:37.952
they don't have the
odds to make that call.

01:09:37.952 --> 01:09:39.910
Alternatively, don't bet
too much on the bluff,

01:09:39.910 --> 01:09:42.680
and I'm making pretty
wide ranges here so

01:09:42.680 --> 01:09:46.360
don't think that I'm
contradicting myself here.

01:09:46.360 --> 01:09:49.500
One of the biggest tells for a
bluff is someone betting more

01:09:49.500 --> 01:09:52.569
than the pot, just because
it means they didn't actually

01:09:52.569 --> 01:09:54.420
think through the
numbers, and they're just

01:09:54.420 --> 01:09:57.506
like I want to bet a lot so
that makes the other guy fold.

01:09:57.506 --> 01:09:59.630
But in general, don't bet
too much, and by too much

01:09:59.630 --> 01:10:03.772
I mean more than the pot.

01:10:03.772 --> 01:10:05.480
And in addition, if
you're short stacked,

01:10:05.480 --> 01:10:07.188
don't bluff an amount
that, if he raised,

01:10:07.188 --> 01:10:08.780
you'd have to call anyway.

01:10:08.780 --> 01:10:14.594
In which case, you should
just bet all in there.

01:10:14.594 --> 01:10:16.510
So don't be afraid of
getting caught bluffing.

01:10:16.510 --> 01:10:18.710
So this is a reason
people don't bluff live.

01:10:18.710 --> 01:10:22.902
It's because they're afraid
of showing down nothing.

01:10:22.902 --> 01:10:23.860
Don't worry about that.

01:10:23.860 --> 01:10:25.906
One of the best indications
to me of someone

01:10:25.906 --> 01:10:28.830
being a good player is they'll
and show down a bad hand

01:10:28.830 --> 01:10:30.147
and just be like, yep.

01:10:30.147 --> 01:10:32.480
That's how you play poker,
and that'll be the end of it.

01:10:32.480 --> 01:10:34.800
So don't worry
about-- what you have

01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:36.590
when you bluff is
completely immaterial.

01:10:36.590 --> 01:10:39.130
So just having a losing
hand that's really bad

01:10:39.130 --> 01:10:41.770
is no different than having
a marginal losing hand.

01:10:41.770 --> 01:10:45.792
So don't be afraid of being
bluffing, especially live.

01:10:45.792 --> 01:10:48.000
People get embarrassed when
they get caught bluffing.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:49.840
Don't worry about it.

01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:51.800
So semi-bluffing
is great compared

01:10:51.800 --> 01:10:55.350
to bluffing because you have
a chance of winning the hand,

01:10:55.350 --> 01:10:57.490
but if you're in position,
sometimes it's better

01:10:57.490 --> 01:10:59.270
just to take a free card.

01:10:59.270 --> 01:11:01.040
If he shows weakness
and checks into you

01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:04.260
when you have an open ended
straight drawn, in some cases

01:11:04.260 --> 01:11:06.780
it's just going to be right to
check and get your free card.

01:11:06.780 --> 01:11:08.740
You have to compare
your EV of checking

01:11:08.740 --> 01:11:11.380
to your EV of bluffing.

01:11:11.380 --> 01:11:15.660
And don't bluff calling
stations because a lot

01:11:15.660 --> 01:11:19.650
of your value from these guys
will come from value betting.

01:11:19.650 --> 01:11:21.910
The only way you'll
possibly lose to them

01:11:21.910 --> 01:11:23.650
is if you try to bluff them.

01:11:23.650 --> 01:11:28.040
You might be in
a situation where

01:11:28.040 --> 01:11:29.950
you're ready to run
over calling stations,

01:11:29.950 --> 01:11:32.490
but you don't have good
cards and bluffing is not

01:11:32.490 --> 01:11:33.470
the way to go.

01:11:33.470 --> 01:11:35.190
So don't do that.

01:11:35.190 --> 01:11:36.160
Let's wrap it up there.

01:11:36.160 --> 01:11:37.070
Thanks everyone.

01:11:37.070 --> 01:11:38.620

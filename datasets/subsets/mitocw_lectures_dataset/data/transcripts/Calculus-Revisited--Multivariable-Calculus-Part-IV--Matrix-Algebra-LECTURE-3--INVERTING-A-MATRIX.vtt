00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.090
PROFESSOR: Hi.

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.920
Today's lesson will
complete our first excursion

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.700
into the subject
of linear algebra

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.530
for the sake of linear algebra.

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.960
And next time, we will
turn our attention

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.380
to applications of linear
algebra and linear equations

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:53.420
and the like, to applications
towards functions

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.930
of several variables in the
cases where the functions are

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:58.850
not necessarily linear.

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.090
Now, you may recall
that we concluded

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:07.030
our last lesson on the note of
talking about inverse matrices,

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:09.880
pointing out that an
inverse matrix existed,

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:16.510
provided that the determinant
of the entries making up

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:20.860
the matrix was not 0, otherwise,
the inverse matrix didn't

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.890
exist, but that we then
said, once we know this,

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:27.850
how do we actually construct
the inverse matrix?

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:29.680
And what I hope to
do in today's lesson

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.000
is to show you a rather elegant
manner for inverting a matrix,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.200
and at the same time, to point
out several other consequences

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.250
that will be helpful in
our study of calculus

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.110
of several variables in
other contexts as we proceed.

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.350
At a rate, today's
lessons is called quite

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.630
simply "Inverting a Matrix."

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.450
And to start with a specific
example in front of us, let's

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.710
invert the matrix
A inverse, where

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:00.370
A is the matrix whose entries
are 1, 1, 1; 2, 3, 4; 3, 4, 6.

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:03.270
Keep in mind, among
the various ways

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.140
of motivating matrix
algebra, we chose

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.810
as our particular
illustration the coding system

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.430
of the matrix representing
the coefficients in a system

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.540
of m equations with n unknowns.

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.140
In this particular case
of a 3 by 3 matrix,

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.300
we view the matrix A
as coding the system

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.970
of three linear equations
and three unknowns,

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:26.760
given by system 1.

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.250
I call it equation 1.

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.970
We have this system of three
equations with three unknowns.

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:36.500
By the way, observe that this
looks very much like a problem

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.250
that we tackled in high
school, except for one

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:40.990
very small change.

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:44.630
In high school, you may remember
that we tackled equations

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:48.840
of the form like this,
provided that the y's

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.410
were replaced by constants.

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:54.040
In other words, we weren't used
to thinking of linear systems

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.000
of equations in terms
of functions this way,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.050
but we were used to thinking of
things like x_1 plus x_2 plus

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:06.480
x_3 equals 2, 2*y_1 plus
3*x_2 plus 4*x_3 equals 9.

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.170
3*x_1 plus 4*x_2
plus 6*x_3 equals 13.

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.830
And then the question
was to solve specifically

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:14.955
for x_1, x_2, and x_3.

00:03:14.955 --> 00:03:15.740
All right?

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:17.974
Now, the only difference
we're making now

00:03:17.974 --> 00:03:19.390
is that we're not
going to specify

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:21.350
what y_1, y_2, and y_3 are.

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:24.210
We'll mention the relationship
between our problem

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:26.640
and the high school one
later in the lecture.

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.630
But what we are saying is this.

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:32.160
We would like, in general, given
these three equations and three

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.780
unknowns, this system
of linear equations,

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:38.120
we would like to be able to
solve for the x's in terms

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.490
of the y's.

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:42.340
And that is what I'm going
to show you is identified

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:43.770
with inverting the matrix.

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:47.690
What I hope to show you as we
go along is that if the matrix A

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:51.040
represents these coefficients,
assuming that we find

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.860
the technique whereby
we can express uniquely

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:58.940
for the x's in terms of the y's,
the coefficients that express

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.270
the x's as linear combinations
of the y's-- those coefficients

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:05.850
involving the y's-- will
turn out to be A inverse.

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:07.570
We'll talk about
that more later.

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:09.450
I simply wanted to
tell you that now

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.700
so that you'd have a head start
into what my plan of attack

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:13.930
is going to be.

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.640
First of all, let me
mention a method which

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:19.269
you may have seen
previously in school,

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:23.210
but a very effective method
for systematizing or solving

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:28.400
systems of linear equations
in a way that works very, very

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:29.810
systematically.

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:31.740
The idea is something like this.

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:37.814
We know that if we replace
one equation-- well, let's

00:04:37.814 --> 00:04:38.480
put it this way.

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.650
If we add equals to equals,
the results are equal.

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:42.690
If we multiply equals
by equals, the results

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:43.910
are equal, et cetera.

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:47.000
Consequently, given a system
of equations like this,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.150
we know that if we replace
one of the equations

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:54.620
by that equation plus a
multiple of any other equation,

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:57.580
you see-- if we add two
equations together, things

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:00.220
of this type, where, as
we change the system,

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:03.200
we don't change the
solutions to the system.

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:05.090
In other words,
there are devices

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:07.990
whereby we can
systematically replace

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:10.450
the given system of
equations, hopefully,

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:13.550
by simpler systems of
equations where the simpler

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:16.410
system of equations has
the same set of solutions

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:18.320
as the original system.

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:21.510
And the method that I'm thinking
of is called diagonalization.

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:24.130
For example, what we often
say is something like this.

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:25.880
We say, lookit, wouldn't
it be nice to get

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:31.270
a system in which x_1 appears
only in the first equation?

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:33.190
And one way of
doing that, notice,

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:35.120
is we observe that in
the second equation,

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:38.710
we have 2*x_1 In the first
equation, we have x_1.

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:43.240
If we were to subtract twice the
first equation from the second

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:46.750
equation and use that for
our new second equation,

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:50.220
notice that the new second
equation would have no x_1 term

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:52.960
in it, because 2*x_1
minus 2*x_1 is 0.

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:58.040
Similarly, since the leading
term in the third equation is

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:01.690
3*x_1 we observe that if we
were to subtract three times

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:03.510
the first equation
from the third,

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:07.060
the resulting third equation
would have no x_1 term in it,

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:10.580
so that the new system would
have x_1 in the first equation

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:12.020
and no place else.

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:16.290
Similarly, we could move over
now to our new second equation,

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:21.840
and then eliminate x_2 from
every equation but the second

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:24.510
by subtracting off the
appropriate multiple

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:26.360
of the second equation.

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:28.210
Now, what I'm
going to do here is

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:30.980
that, since it gets kind of
messy working with the y_1's,

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:32.450
y_2's, and y_3's
and it stretches

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:35.300
out all over the
place, let me invent

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:37.570
a new type of coding system.

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:40.420
I will take these three
equations and three unknowns

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:45.250
and represent it by a 3
by 6 matrix as follows.

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:49.650
I will start up with the
following coding system.

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:51.550
I will use place value.

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:54.880
The first three columns will
represent x_1, x_2, x_3,

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:56.150
respectively.

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:59.570
The next three columns will
represent y_1, y_2, and y_3,

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:00.330
respectively.

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:03.850
I'll assume an equal
sign divides this.

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:07.560
And this will simply be a
coding device for reading what?

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:11.050
x_1 plus x_2 plus
x_3 equals y_1.

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:15.740
2*x_1 plus 3*x_2 plus
4*x_3 equals y_2.

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:19.480
3*x_1 plus 4*x_2 plus
6*x_3 equals y_3.

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:20.670
Notice why I say y_3.

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:24.540
It's 0*y_1 plus 0*y_2 plus
1*y_3, which, of course,

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:26.100
is y_3.

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:31.880
Notice also that the left
side of this 3 by 6 matrix

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:38.650
is precisely the matrix A that
we're investigating back here.

00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:40.990
I just want that for
future reference.

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:43.670
Now, let me go through
this procedure.

00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:46.880
What I will now do is subtract
twice the first equation

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:49.620
from the second and make
that my new second one.

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:52.290
And I will subtract three
times the first equation

00:07:52.290 --> 00:07:56.330
from the third to give me
my new third equation, which

00:07:56.330 --> 00:07:59.030
means, in terms of
the matrix notation,

00:07:59.030 --> 00:08:02.530
that I am replacing the
second row of this matrix

00:08:02.530 --> 00:08:05.010
by the second row minus
twice the first row.

00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:08.700
I'm replacing the third row by
the third row minus three times

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:09.700
the first row.

00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:14.360
I now wind up with this
particular 3 by 6 matrix.

00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:20.280
Again, just by brief review,
what this matrix system tells

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:22.530
me, for example, is,
among other things,

00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:27.620
that x_2 plus 2*x_3 is
minus 2*y_1 plus y_2.

00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:30.420
You see, not only do I
have a coding system here,

00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:33.610
but the right-hand
side allows me

00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:37.419
to check how I got the resulting
matrix on the left hand side.

00:08:37.419 --> 00:08:40.200
It tells me how the y's had
to be combined to give me this

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:42.090
combination of the x's.

00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:45.290
At any rate, I now
want to eliminate 1

00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:49.180
every place in the second
column except in the second row.

00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:52.230
So looking at this matrix
now, what I will do

00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:56.080
is I will replace the first row
by the first minus the second--

00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:57.630
see, 1 minus 1 is 0.

00:08:57.630 --> 00:09:00.590
So my new first row
will have a 0 here.

00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:02.450
I will then replace
the third row

00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:05.790
by the third minus the
second, again, meaning what?

00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:08.630
That my new third row
will have a 0 here.

00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:11.770
Leaving the details for
you to check for yourself,

00:09:11.770 --> 00:09:16.120
the resulting 3 by 6
matrix now looks like this.

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:18.440
By the way, again notice
what this tells me.

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:20.200
Among other things,
this tells me

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:26.160
that x_3 is minus y_1
minus y_2 plus y_3, which

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:29.260
somehow tells me
that to find x_3,

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:32.960
I essentially have to do what?

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:39.890
I can subtract the sum of
the first and second equation

00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:42.960
from the third equation,
and that will give me x_3.

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:45.840
By the way, just as a
quick look over here,

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:48.220
just to show you how
nice this technique is,

00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:51.600
maybe somebody who had been very
quick could have looked at this

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:53.330
system of equations
and said, you know,

00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:55.530
if I add the first
two equations,

00:09:55.530 --> 00:10:00.590
this will give me a 3*x_1,
this will give me a 4*x_2,

00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:03.640
and therefore, if I subtract
that from the third equation,

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:08.410
the x_1 term and the x_2 terms
will drop out, et cetera.

00:10:08.410 --> 00:10:10.800
The thing I want to point out
is that this matrix system

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:13.300
makes geniuses out of
all of us, that we do not

00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:16.880
have to be able to see these
intricacies to be able to get

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:19.050
down to a stage like this.

00:10:19.050 --> 00:10:21.390
By the way, again,
what this tells me is

00:10:21.390 --> 00:10:25.890
I now have a simpler method for
solving this original system

00:10:25.890 --> 00:10:26.810
of equations.

00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:28.710
Namely, I can now
solve this system

00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:30.960
of equations-- the one
that's coded by this--

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:32.680
and the solutions
of this equation

00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:35.280
will be the same
set as the solutions

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:36.540
to my original equation.

00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:40.320
At any rate, continuing this
diagonalization method still

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:43.630
more, what I now do is
I try to replace what?

00:10:43.630 --> 00:10:47.120
In the third column, I
try to get 0's everywhere

00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:49.360
except in the third row.

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:52.120
And to put that in
still other words,

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:54.040
I guess, in the
language of matrices,

00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:56.990
what I'm going to try
to do is get what?

00:10:56.990 --> 00:10:59.500
The three by three
identity matrix

00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:05.130
to make up the first
half over here--

00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:07.020
that's in terms of
the matrix language.

00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:09.630
Now again, to show you quickly
what I'm trying to do here,

00:11:09.630 --> 00:11:11.510
I'm simply going
to what over here?

00:11:11.510 --> 00:11:14.600
I'm going to replace
the first row

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:16.090
by the first plus the third.

00:11:16.090 --> 00:11:18.560
I'm going to replace the
second row by the second row

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:20.250
minus twice the third.

00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:24.430
I now wind up with
this particular matrix.

00:11:24.430 --> 00:11:29.350
I claim that the
right half-- see,

00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:31.680
the left half of this matrix
is the identity matrix.

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:34.180
I claim that the left half
is the identity matrix.

00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:36.630
I calm the right
half is A inverse.

00:11:39.490 --> 00:11:40.490
That's what my claim is.

00:11:40.490 --> 00:11:42.730
And by the way, let's
see why I say that.

00:11:42.730 --> 00:11:46.150
What system of equations
does A inverse code?

00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:47.740
Just read what this says.

00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:53.010
It says x_1 is equal to
2*y_1 minus 2*y_2 plus y_3.

00:11:53.010 --> 00:11:55.780
x_2 is equal to y_2 minus 2*y_3.

00:11:55.780 --> 00:11:59.870
And x_3 is minus y_1
minus y_2 plus y_3.

00:11:59.870 --> 00:12:02.820
In other words, A inverse
codes this particular system.

00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:04.640
Let's call that system 2.

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:08.690
How are system 2 and what
we call system 1 related?

00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:13.000
The relationship was that system
1 expressed the y's in terms

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.180
of the x's.

00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:17.910
System 2 shows what it would
look like if the x's were

00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:19.670
expressed in terms of the y's.

00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:23.300
And so what we have done, in the
language of-- whatever you want

00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:26.180
to call it-- but what we've
done is we've inverted the role

00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:28.410
of the variables, that we
started with the y's given

00:12:28.410 --> 00:12:29.640
in terms of the x's.

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:33.200
We now have the x's expressed
in terms of the y's.

00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:36.820
Now, since you may want to see
this more in matrix language,

00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:41.170
let me show you another way of
seeing the same result, that

00:12:41.170 --> 00:12:43.340
uses the word inverse
in the way we're

00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:45.990
used to seeing
inverse matrix defined

00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:49.190
in terms of our present course.

00:12:49.190 --> 00:12:52.250
The matrix algebra
interpretation is simply this.

00:12:52.250 --> 00:12:55.600
Let's rewrite system 1 so
that you can see it here.

00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:59.610
And the interesting
point is the following.

00:12:59.610 --> 00:13:06.315
Think of these y's as forming
a column vector or column

00:13:06.315 --> 00:13:08.440
matrix-- whichever way you
want to read this thing.

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:11.640
In other words, I am
going to view this

00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:15.550
as being the matrix which has
three rows and one column,

00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:20.030
namely the matrix y_1 y_2, y_3.

00:13:20.030 --> 00:13:23.030
I am now going to take the
matrix of coefficients here,

00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:25.760
which, as we recall, is the
matrix A. But that's what?

00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:30.170
[1, 1, 1; 2, 3, 4; 3, 4, 6].

00:13:30.170 --> 00:13:35.740
And I am now going to write
x_1, x_2, x_3 as a column vector

00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:37.580
rather than as a row vector.

00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:41.410
And in turn, I can think of
that as being a column matrix--

00:13:41.410 --> 00:13:46.240
again, 3 by 1 matrix--
three rows, one column.

00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:51.350
Now, what I claim is that
this system of three equations

00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:53.640
and three unknowns,
so to speak, is

00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:58.060
equivalent to the single
matrix equation given by this.

00:13:58.060 --> 00:14:00.420
In fact, to make
this easier to read,

00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:06.270
let's let capital Y denote the
column matrix [y 1; y2; y3].

00:14:06.270 --> 00:14:11.670
Let's let capital X denote the
column matrix [x 1; x2; x3],

00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:14.640
and capital A, as before,
the original matrix.

00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:17.790
And my claim is that this system
of three equations and three

00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:21.220
unknowns is represented by
the single matrix equation

00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:25.400
capital Y equals A times
capital X. And just

00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:27.550
to show you by way of
a very quick review why

00:14:27.550 --> 00:14:31.580
this is the case, remember
how we multiply two matrices.

00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:34.810
To find the term in the
first row, first column,

00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:37.900
we multiply the first
row of the first

00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:40.560
by the first column
of the second.

00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:43.230
And since that's supposed
to equal this matrix,

00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:45.930
and since matrices are
equal only if they're

00:14:45.930 --> 00:14:49.940
equal entry by entry, it
means that this product

00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:51.670
must equal y_1.

00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:53.150
Notice what that says.

00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:57.890
It says x_1 plus x_2
plus x_3 equals y_1.

00:14:57.890 --> 00:15:05.400
Similarly, 2 times x_1 plus
3 times x_2 plus 4 times x_3

00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:08.600
is going to have to equal y_2.

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:13.400
And similarly, 3 times x_1 plus
4 times x_2 plus 6 times x_3

00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:15.350
is going to have to equal y_3.

00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:18.030
And that's precisely the
original system of equations

00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:20.420
that we began with.

00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:25.930
Now, notice that this expresses
the matrix Y as something times

00:15:25.930 --> 00:15:29.430
the matrix X. If
A inverse exists,

00:15:29.430 --> 00:15:33.010
multiply both sides of this
matrix equation by A inverse.

00:15:33.010 --> 00:15:35.910
On the left hand side,
we get A inverse Y.

00:15:35.910 --> 00:15:39.470
On the right-hand side,
A inverse times A*X,

00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:42.880
by associativity, is
A inverse A times X.

00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:45.370
A inverse times A is
the identity matrix.

00:15:45.370 --> 00:15:48.140
The identity matrix doesn't
change the given matrix

00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:49.300
that it's multiplying.

00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:53.350
So we have that A
inverse Y is just X.

00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:56.400
And notice that the
role of A inverse

00:15:56.400 --> 00:16:00.330
is, again, just as mentioned
above, that what we've done

00:16:00.330 --> 00:16:03.310
is we have started with
Y given as a matrix times

00:16:03.310 --> 00:16:06.860
X. We now have X expressed
as a matrix times

00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:10.890
Y. In fact, if you now take
the matrix that we called

00:16:10.890 --> 00:16:14.730
A inverse originally and
carry out this operation,

00:16:14.730 --> 00:16:18.300
we will see that this is
precisely what does happen.

00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:20.070
This is what the
identification is.

00:16:20.070 --> 00:16:22.490
In other words, the
system of equations

00:16:22.490 --> 00:16:26.180
is identifiable with a
single matrix equation.

00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:29.140
And that matrix equation
can be inverted,

00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:32.920
meaning we can solve for X
in terms of Y if and only

00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:35.320
if A inverse exists.

00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:37.810
There is still a
third interpretation,

00:16:37.810 --> 00:16:41.840
an interpretation that goes
back to the idea of mappings.

00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:44.400
And that is, we can think
of the original system

00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:48.660
1 as a mapping that carries
three-dimensional space

00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:50.340
into three-dimensional space.

00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:52.150
How does it carry
three-dimensional space

00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:53.380
into three-dimensional space?

00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:59.730
Well, we view it as carrying
the 3-tuple (x_1, x_2, x_3)

00:16:59.730 --> 00:17:07.880
into the 3-tuple (y_1, y_2,
y_3) by the system of equations

00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:09.744
defined by system 1.

00:17:09.744 --> 00:17:11.869
And to show you what I mean
by that in more detail,

00:17:11.869 --> 00:17:17.310
suppose I pick x_1 to be 1,
x_2 to be 1, x_3 to be 1.

00:17:17.310 --> 00:17:20.050
Just for the sake of argument,
suppose I picked that.

00:17:20.050 --> 00:17:22.200
x_1, x_2, x_3 are all 1.

00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:23.650
What this means is-- lookit.

00:17:23.650 --> 00:17:25.400
Come back to the
original system,

00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:28.130
replace x_1, x_2, and x_3 by 1.

00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:35.430
If we do that, we see that y_1
is 3, y_2 is 9, and y_3 is 13.

00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:37.060
Therefore, we would say what?

00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:43.327
That f bar maps (1,
1, 1) into (3, 9, 13).

00:17:43.327 --> 00:17:45.660
By the way, you're going to
notice this sooner or later.

00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:47.284
This bothered me when
I first did this.

00:17:47.284 --> 00:17:48.480
This is just a little aside.

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:51.960
You may have noticed that when
I was arbitrarily writing down

00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:56.184
numbers to pick for y_1, y_2,
and y_3, when we first started

00:17:56.184 --> 00:17:57.600
at the beginning
of the lecture, I

00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:02.650
said why don't we let y_1 be
2, y_2 be 9, and y_3 be 13.

00:18:02.650 --> 00:18:04.980
And it looks almost
like I made a mistake

00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:07.590
and meant to get (2,
9, 13) back again.

00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:10.050
I got (3, 9, 13).

00:18:10.050 --> 00:18:16.610
Notice that to get (2, 9, 13), I
couldn't pick x_1, x_2, and x_3

00:18:16.610 --> 00:18:21.060
all to be 1, but I could
pick x_1 to be minus 1,

00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:24.130
x_2 to be 1, x_3 to be 2.

00:18:24.130 --> 00:18:29.300
And then what that says is
if I let x_1 be minus 1,

00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:33.460
x_2 be plus 1, and
x_3 be 3, it says

00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:36.610
that, under those conditions,
y_1 would have been 2,

00:18:36.610 --> 00:18:41.120
y_2 would have been 9, and
y_3 would have been 13.

00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:43.120
Of course, the question
that you now may ask,

00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:46.560
which I hope gives you some sort
of a cross reference to go by,

00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:48.220
is how did I know?

00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:50.640
See, starting with
(1, 1, 1), it seemed

00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:54.280
very easy to find
the image (3, 9, 13).

00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:57.220
Now, I say, starting
with the image,

00:18:57.220 --> 00:19:01.550
how do I find that this is
what mapped into (2, 9, 13)?

00:19:01.550 --> 00:19:02.594
How did I know?

00:19:02.594 --> 00:19:03.510
See, here it was easy.

00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:06.497
I started with the input x bar.

00:19:06.497 --> 00:19:08.080
But here, I'm starting
with the output

00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:09.560
and I'm trying to
find the input.

00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:12.740
How did I find (-1,
1, 2) that fast?

00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:15.400
And the answer is that's
precisely where the role

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:17.460
of the inverse matrix comes in.

00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:20.700
You see, going back to what
we did just a little while

00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:25.070
ago, when we inverted
system 1 to get system 2,

00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:26.440
what did we do?

00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:31.420
We showed how to find x_1,
x_2, x_3 once y_1, y_2,

00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:32.700
and y_3 were given.

00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:35.690
So all I had to do here was,
knowing that I wanted y_1

00:19:35.690 --> 00:19:39.950
to be 2, y_2 to be
9, and y_3 to be 13,

00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:42.770
I just shoved those
values in here

00:19:42.770 --> 00:19:45.890
and saw what x_1,
x_2, and x_3 were.

00:19:45.890 --> 00:19:49.250
In fact, this is why working
with the y's is an improvement

00:19:49.250 --> 00:19:52.080
over what the high school
system was of picking

00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:53.070
the y's to be constant.

00:19:53.070 --> 00:19:55.770
You see, once I've
done this, I can

00:19:55.770 --> 00:20:00.440
find what x_1, x_2, x_3 look
like in terms of the y's,

00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:04.560
all in one shot, regardless
of what values of y somebody

00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:07.120
is going to give me to
play around with later on.

00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:11.940
But returning now to our
immediate problem, notice,

00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:16.260
all I'm saying is that when
I'm given a system of n

00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:18.690
linear equations and
n unknowns, or even

00:20:18.690 --> 00:20:20.400
n equations and
unknowns-- in this case

00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:22.980
we had three linear equations
and three unknowns--

00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:26.090
I can view that in a very
natural way as a mapping

00:20:26.090 --> 00:20:29.920
from three-dimensional space
into three-dimensional space.

00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:33.720
Notice that the makers of
coefficients A and the mapping

00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:35.585
f bar-- and I'll
coin a word here,

00:20:35.585 --> 00:20:37.960
because I don't know exactly
how I want you to see this--

00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:39.510
but they're identifiable.

00:20:39.510 --> 00:20:41.660
They're essentially equivalent.

00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:45.630
Notice that, given x bar,
I want to apply f bar

00:20:45.630 --> 00:20:47.650
to that to find y bar.

00:20:47.650 --> 00:20:49.950
Notice that, in terms
of our matrix language,

00:20:49.950 --> 00:20:54.100
we show that, after
all, the matrix capital

00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:58.230
Y, which had entries
y_1, y_2, y_3,

00:20:58.230 --> 00:21:01.510
is just a different numeral
for writing this vector.

00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:02.850
This is a 3-tuple.

00:21:02.850 --> 00:21:06.650
This is the same 3-tuple written
as a column rather as a row.

00:21:06.650 --> 00:21:11.150
x bar is a 3-tuple, but
capital X that same 3-tuple

00:21:11.150 --> 00:21:14.480
written as a column vector
rather than as a row vector.

00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:16.920
But notice that
the identification

00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:19.920
that if y bar is f
bar of x bar, that

00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:23.340
says the same information
as saying that capital Y

00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:26.880
is the matrix A times capital X.

00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:30.620
These convey equivalent
pieces of information.

00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:33.840
In still other words,
notice that, in finding

00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:37.630
the images of f bar here
and inverting the images,

00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:42.160
I used precisely the same
device that I used in the system

00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:44.660
without giving the
mapping interpretation.

00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:48.160
In other words, these do
convey the same information

00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:50.650
so that from a
major point of view,

00:21:50.650 --> 00:21:55.520
we can identify the matrix
A with the mapping f bar.

00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:59.590
And you see, what this means
is that if we can identify

00:21:59.590 --> 00:22:03.860
A with f bar, we should be
able to identify A inverse

00:22:03.860 --> 00:22:05.260
with the inverse function.

00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:07.635
See, that's the other way
we've used the word "inverse"--

00:22:07.635 --> 00:22:09.210
as an inverse function.

00:22:09.210 --> 00:22:13.400
The existence of A inverse is
equivalent to the existence

00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:15.270
of f bar inverse.

00:22:15.270 --> 00:22:18.000
And by the way, we showed that.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:21.330
You see, using the system of
equations that we started with,

00:22:21.330 --> 00:22:24.980
we showed that if x_1
is minus 1, x_2 is 1,

00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:29.920
and x_3 is 2, that y_1
would be 2, y_2 would be 9,

00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:32.030
and y_3 would be 13.

00:22:32.030 --> 00:22:36.200
We also showed that if we
start with y_1 equals 2,

00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:39.320
y_2 equals 9, and
y_3 equals 13, then

00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:43.610
the x's had to be given
by minus 1, 1, and 2.

00:22:43.610 --> 00:22:45.510
In terms of the mapping,
what we're saying

00:22:45.510 --> 00:22:53.290
is not only does (-1, 1, 2) map
into (2, 9, 13), but (2, 9, 13)

00:22:53.290 --> 00:22:58.440
can only be obtained from
the 3-tuple (-1, 1, 2).

00:22:58.440 --> 00:23:00.730
You see, in essence, in
this particular case,

00:23:00.730 --> 00:23:02.680
the existence of
A inverse showed

00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:06.080
that f bar was onto-- we could
get any 3-tuple we wanted--

00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:09.090
and it was also one-to-one.

00:23:09.090 --> 00:23:11.870
The important point, in terms
of our theory of matrices,

00:23:11.870 --> 00:23:16.680
is that, since f bar inverse
need not exist for a given f,

00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:21.130
A inverse need not exist for a
given matrix A. In other words,

00:23:21.130 --> 00:23:24.430
if we're identifying the
matrix with the function,

00:23:24.430 --> 00:23:26.550
if the inverse
function doesn't exist,

00:23:26.550 --> 00:23:28.830
the inverse matrix
doesn't exist.

00:23:28.830 --> 00:23:33.840
In other words, not all
matrices are invertible.

00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:36.730
And let's emphasize that.

00:23:36.730 --> 00:23:40.090
We knew that from before,
but let's emphasize this now

00:23:40.090 --> 00:23:42.320
in terms of our structure.

00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:44.390
Namely, let's take
a new example.

00:23:44.390 --> 00:23:47.720
Let's try to invert a matrix
which doesn't have an inverse.

00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:50.700
Obviously, if I try to do
that, I should fail dismally.

00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:52.790
And let's see how
that does work out.

00:23:52.790 --> 00:23:57.860
Let me take the matrix A to be
[1, 1, 1; 2, 3, 4; 3, 4, 5].

00:23:57.860 --> 00:23:59.590
I deliberately
called this A again,

00:23:59.590 --> 00:24:01.500
even though we've used A before.

00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:03.790
I've deliberately made
this A look very much

00:24:03.790 --> 00:24:05.710
like the A we
worked with before.

00:24:05.710 --> 00:24:07.690
If you compare this
with our original A,

00:24:07.690 --> 00:24:12.710
the only difference is I now
have a 5 here rather than a 6.

00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:16.840
I simply wanted to show you
how a subtle change can affect

00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:19.680
the existence of an inverse.

00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:21.880
Again, by way of
very quick review,

00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:26.000
before we go any further,
notice that this matrix

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.400
codes what system of equations?

00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:30.870
This particular
system of equations.

00:24:30.870 --> 00:24:34.030
And so that you don't
see any hanky-panky

00:24:34.030 --> 00:24:37.400
going on here and wondering why
I knew that something was going

00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:40.360
to go wrong here, let
me show you in advance

00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:45.340
why I can't invert this, then
show you how our matrix coding

00:24:45.340 --> 00:24:47.150
system gives us the
same information,

00:24:47.150 --> 00:24:49.320
even if we weren't bright
enough to see this.

00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:53.290
Just for the sake of argument,
suppose I had a keen enough eye

00:24:53.290 --> 00:24:57.270
to observe right away that if I
added the first two equations,

00:24:57.270 --> 00:25:01.160
I would get that y_1
plus y_2 is what?

00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:04.460
3*x_1 plus 4*x_2 plus 5*x_3.

00:25:07.710 --> 00:25:11.150
And now I look at
this result, compare

00:25:11.150 --> 00:25:14.530
that with my third equation
where the right-hand sides

00:25:14.530 --> 00:25:17.020
are identical, and
conclude from this

00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:20.430
that this is not really three
equations with three unknowns.

00:25:20.430 --> 00:25:23.810
This is really two equations
with three unknowns,

00:25:23.810 --> 00:25:27.310
because this equation here
is either redundant or

00:25:27.310 --> 00:25:31.610
incompatible, meaning, notice
that these two facts tell me

00:25:31.610 --> 00:25:35.070
that y_1 plus y_2
has to equal y_3.

00:25:35.070 --> 00:25:36.720
To show you what I
mean by that, let

00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:41.660
me pick specific values for
y_1, y_2, and y_3, in which y_3

00:25:41.660 --> 00:25:44.520
is not equal to y_1 plus y_2.

00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:47.409
And to keep this as
close to the problem

00:25:47.409 --> 00:25:48.950
that we were working
with originally,

00:25:48.950 --> 00:25:53.900
let me pick y_1 to be 2, y_2
to be 9, and y_3 to be 13.

00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:59.010
Notice that this system of
equations cannot possibly have

00:25:59.010 --> 00:26:00.750
a solution now.

00:26:00.750 --> 00:26:03.700
This system of equations
here cannot possibly have

00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:06.805
a solution, because if it had a
solution, it would imply what?

00:26:06.805 --> 00:26:08.520
That if I add these
two equations,

00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:13.080
it would say that 3*x_1 plus
4*x_2 plus 5*x_3 equals 11--

00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:14.700
if I add these two equations.

00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:17.730
That would say it
also has to equal 13.

00:26:17.730 --> 00:26:19.807
And since 11 is
equal to 13-- and I

00:26:19.807 --> 00:26:22.140
have to correct a mistake I
made in an earlier lecture--

00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:26.010
it's for large values of
11 that 11 is equal to 13.

00:26:26.010 --> 00:26:30.070
But other than that,
11 is unequal to 13.

00:26:30.070 --> 00:26:33.300
This means that it's
impossible to find solutions

00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:34.400
to this equation.

00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:37.500
Well, we'll come back to
that in a little while

00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:39.920
and we'll also emphasize
this in the exercises.

00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:42.250
But the main point
now is to show

00:26:42.250 --> 00:26:45.340
how we could have obtained
this information by our matrix

00:26:45.340 --> 00:26:46.340
coding system.

00:26:46.340 --> 00:26:49.110
And we do exactly the same
thing as we did before.

00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:52.740
We take this matrix and
we augment it by the 3

00:26:52.740 --> 00:26:54.970
by 3 identity matrix.

00:26:54.970 --> 00:27:02.120
Remember again, what our coding
system says is that the first

00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:06.330
three columns represent the
x's, the next three the y's.

00:27:06.330 --> 00:27:08.790
For example, this says
x_1 plus x_2 plus x_3

00:27:08.790 --> 00:27:10.360
equals y_1, et cetera.

00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:13.940
We now go through what I call
the row reducing operations,

00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:14.780
which means what?

00:27:14.780 --> 00:27:19.780
We're going to replace rows
by the rows plus or minus

00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:22.650
a suitable multiple of another
row so that we do what?

00:27:22.650 --> 00:27:28.490
We wind up with a 1, eventually,
only here and 0's elsewhere,

00:27:28.490 --> 00:27:32.574
a 1 here, 0's here, a 1 here and
0's here-- if we can do that.

00:27:32.574 --> 00:27:33.740
Let's see what happens here.

00:27:33.740 --> 00:27:35.390
What I'm going to
do, of course, is

00:27:35.390 --> 00:27:37.056
I'm going to replace
the second row here

00:27:37.056 --> 00:27:39.090
by the second minus
twice the first.

00:27:39.090 --> 00:27:42.060
I'll replace the third row
by the third minus 3 times

00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:42.740
the first.

00:27:42.740 --> 00:27:46.050
I now wind up with
this equivalent matrix,

00:27:46.050 --> 00:27:48.370
that this matrix codes the
same system of equations

00:27:48.370 --> 00:27:50.050
as the original matrix.

00:27:50.050 --> 00:27:52.930
Now, I'm going to replace the
first row by the first row

00:27:52.930 --> 00:27:54.200
minus the second.

00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:57.250
I will replace the third row by
the third row minus the second.

00:27:57.250 --> 00:27:59.040
And since I already
have a 1 in here,

00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:01.340
I will leave the
second row intact.

00:28:01.340 --> 00:28:06.050
And if I do that, I now wind
up with this 3 by 6 matrix.

00:28:06.050 --> 00:28:08.140
And now a very
interesting thing has

00:28:08.140 --> 00:28:13.890
happened-- maybe
alarming, maybe unhappy,

00:28:13.890 --> 00:28:17.380
but nonetheless interesting.

00:28:17.380 --> 00:28:21.910
I observe that on the left-hand
side of my 3 by 6 matrix here,

00:28:21.910 --> 00:28:26.500
I have a row consisting entirely
of 0's, that in row reducing

00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:29.270
this, I have lost any chance
of getting a 1 over here

00:28:29.270 --> 00:28:32.340
because this whole
row has dropped out.

00:28:32.340 --> 00:28:35.449
See, one of two things had
to happen when I row reduced.

00:28:35.449 --> 00:28:37.990
Either, when I finished, I would
have had the identity matrix

00:28:37.990 --> 00:28:42.590
here, or else I would have
had, in this left-hand half,

00:28:42.590 --> 00:28:44.120
at least one row of 0's.

00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:47.140
In this case, I got
the one row of 0's.

00:28:47.140 --> 00:28:49.810
Let's translate what
this thing says.

00:28:49.810 --> 00:28:54.890
It says x_1 minus x_3
is 3*y_1 minus y_2.

00:28:54.890 --> 00:28:59.350
x_2 plus 2*x_3 is
minus 2*y_1 plus y_2.

00:28:59.350 --> 00:29:01.220
And it also says that what?

00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:04.780
0*x_1 plus 0*x_2 plus
0*x_3-- in other words, 0--

00:29:04.780 --> 00:29:09.730
is equal to minus y_1
minus y_2 plus y_3.

00:29:09.730 --> 00:29:13.160
And let's write that
to emphasize this.

00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:18.250
You see, what we really have
from the first two equations

00:29:18.250 --> 00:29:21.820
is this system here-- two
equations but in three

00:29:21.820 --> 00:29:23.810
unknowns-- x_1, x_2, x_3.

00:29:23.810 --> 00:29:26.830
We're assuming that
the y's are knowns now.

00:29:26.830 --> 00:29:28.750
The third piece of
information I've

00:29:28.750 --> 00:29:32.760
written in an accentuated
form to emphasize the fact

00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:35.884
that the third equation tells
us under what conditions

00:29:35.884 --> 00:29:38.050
we're in trouble as far as
the choice of the y's are

00:29:38.050 --> 00:29:39.160
concerned.

00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:43.160
Namely, what this tells
us is that minus y_1

00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:47.190
minus y_2 plus y_3 has to
be 0 to be able to solve

00:29:47.190 --> 00:29:48.199
the system at all.

00:29:48.199 --> 00:29:49.740
That's the same as
saying, of course,

00:29:49.740 --> 00:29:52.440
that y_3 is y_1 plus y_2.

00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:54.310
So the first thing
we know is that,

00:29:54.310 --> 00:29:59.440
unless y_3 equals y_1 plus
y_2, we cannot express

00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:02.750
the x's in terms of the y's.

00:30:02.750 --> 00:30:04.250
Why can't we express them?

00:30:04.250 --> 00:30:05.990
The system is incompatible.

00:30:05.990 --> 00:30:10.060
That's exactly, by the way,
what we observed over here.

00:30:10.060 --> 00:30:13.320
Only now, we don't have to
be that bright to notice it.

00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:15.810
See, here we have
to astutely observe

00:30:15.810 --> 00:30:18.830
that the third equation was
the sum of the first two.

00:30:18.830 --> 00:30:22.480
Our matrix coding system told us
right away that what went wrong

00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:26.070
here was that y_3
equals y_1 plus y_2.

00:30:26.070 --> 00:30:28.760
So unless y_3
equals y_1 plus y_2,

00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:32.070
we cannot express the
x's in terms of the y's.

00:30:32.070 --> 00:30:34.620
The second thing
that goes wrong is

00:30:34.620 --> 00:30:39.750
that even if y_3 equals y_1
plus y_2-- then, for example,

00:30:39.750 --> 00:30:42.500
we still can't express the
x's in terms of the y's,

00:30:42.500 --> 00:30:43.959
because-- I say
"for example" here,

00:30:43.959 --> 00:30:45.708
because I could have
picked any of the x's

00:30:45.708 --> 00:30:46.900
as far as that's concerned.

00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:51.630
But for example, x_3 is
independent of y_1 and y_2.

00:30:51.630 --> 00:30:54.420
I add "and y3" in
parentheses here,

00:30:54.420 --> 00:30:56.810
because notice, in
the second case,

00:30:56.810 --> 00:30:59.460
y_3 is not independent
of y_1 and y_2.

00:30:59.460 --> 00:31:03.610
y_3 is equal to y_1 plus y_2,
so it's automatically specified

00:31:03.610 --> 00:31:05.569
as soon as I know y_1 and y_2.

00:31:05.569 --> 00:31:06.610
But here what I'm saying.

00:31:06.610 --> 00:31:11.320
If I now take this
result here and come back

00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:14.210
to this system of
equations, assuming

00:31:14.210 --> 00:31:18.960
that y_1 plus y_2 is y_3 so that
I now have this constraint here

00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:23.670
met, notice that I can pick
x_3 completely at random,

00:31:23.670 --> 00:31:29.500
independently of what the
values of y_1 and y_2 are,

00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:32.170
and solve for x_1 and x_2.

00:31:32.170 --> 00:31:36.260
In other words, I have a
degree of freedom here.

00:31:36.260 --> 00:31:38.990
The x's are not completely
determined by the y's.

00:31:38.990 --> 00:31:41.660
One of the x's can
be chosen at random.

00:31:41.660 --> 00:31:43.120
It floats around.

00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:45.770
OK, so you see what goes wrong
here from the point of view

00:31:45.770 --> 00:31:47.360
of inverting the equations?

00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:52.560
If the constraint, meaning y_3
equals y_1 plus y_2 is not met,

00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:54.520
you can't invert at all.

00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:56.420
The system is incompatible.

00:31:56.420 --> 00:31:59.620
If the constraint is met,
the x's aren't completely

00:31:59.620 --> 00:32:00.690
determined by the y's.

00:32:00.690 --> 00:32:02.490
You can pick one of
the x's at random,

00:32:02.490 --> 00:32:04.790
and then solve for
the remaining two.

00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:09.089
Now, what does
this mean in terms

00:32:09.089 --> 00:32:10.380
of our function interpretation?

00:32:10.380 --> 00:32:12.400
And I think you may enjoy
this, because I think

00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:14.700
it'll show things very nicely.

00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:17.410
What it means, for
example, is this.

00:32:17.410 --> 00:32:20.200
Suppose I now look
at the mapping that's

00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:22.990
defined by the
system of equations

00:32:22.990 --> 00:32:24.860
that we were just talking about.

00:32:24.860 --> 00:32:29.450
Notice that what we're saying
is that, unless y_3 equals

00:32:29.450 --> 00:32:32.880
y_1 plus y_2, there's
no hope of finding

00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:36.060
x's that solve that
particular equation.

00:32:36.060 --> 00:32:39.830
In other words, if it turns
out, given this mapping,

00:32:39.830 --> 00:32:44.105
that y bar is (1, 1, 3),
then there is no x bar such

00:32:44.105 --> 00:32:47.090
that f bar of x bar
is equal to y bar,

00:32:47.090 --> 00:32:50.850
because 3 is
unequal to 1 plus 1.

00:32:50.850 --> 00:32:52.540
You see, again,
what we're saying,

00:32:52.540 --> 00:32:56.180
in terms of the mapping
here, is to get a solution,

00:32:56.180 --> 00:32:59.810
the y's have to be no
longer arbitrary, but chosen

00:32:59.810 --> 00:33:02.860
to satisfy a
specific constraint.

00:33:02.860 --> 00:33:05.440
And in the system of
equations 3 that we

00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:08.300
dealt with in this case,
that constraint was y_3

00:33:08.300 --> 00:33:10.570
equals y_1 plus y_2.

00:33:10.570 --> 00:33:13.080
In other words, what this
means in terms of the mapping

00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:15.800
is that f bar is not onto.

00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:18.120
See, notice, the equation
wasn't invertible.

00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:20.100
A inverse didn't exist.

00:33:20.100 --> 00:33:23.170
Therefore, f bar
inverse shouldn't exist,

00:33:23.170 --> 00:33:25.460
and for f bar
inverse not to exist,

00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:28.940
it's sufficient that f bar
be either not onto, or else

00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:30.070
not one-to-one.

00:33:30.070 --> 00:33:33.350
And we have now shown that f
bar is not onto, because nothing

00:33:33.350 --> 00:33:35.590
maps into (1, 1, 3).

00:33:35.590 --> 00:33:37.230
We can go one step
further and show

00:33:37.230 --> 00:33:39.000
that even if the
constraint is met--

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.690
suppose we pick
a y bar where y_3

00:33:41.690 --> 00:33:46.830
is equal to y_1 plus y_2,
for example, (1, 1, 2).

00:33:46.830 --> 00:33:48.930
See, 2 is equal to 1 plus 1.

00:33:48.930 --> 00:33:52.410
Then the system of equations
that we had before applies.

00:33:52.410 --> 00:33:55.470
What was that system of
equations that we had before?

00:33:55.470 --> 00:34:01.360
It was x_1 minus x_3
equals 3*y_1 minus y_2.

00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:05.450
x_2 plus 2*x_3 equals
minus 2*y_1 plus y_2.

00:34:05.450 --> 00:34:08.250
The third equation
wasn't an equation.

00:34:08.250 --> 00:34:10.350
It was the constraint
that required

00:34:10.350 --> 00:34:13.000
that y_3 equals y_1 plus y_2.

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:14.170
So that's been met.

00:34:14.170 --> 00:34:17.010
So we now down to what?

00:34:17.010 --> 00:34:22.209
Two equations in three
unknowns-- first of all,

00:34:22.209 --> 00:34:24.250
let's take a look and see
what happens over here.

00:34:24.250 --> 00:34:26.560
In this case, y_1 is 1.

00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:27.880
y_2 is 1.

00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:30.780
So x_1 minus x_3 is simply 2.

00:34:30.780 --> 00:34:33.790
x_2 plus 2*x_3 is
simply minus 1.

00:34:33.790 --> 00:34:40.739
I can now pick x_3 at random
and solve for x_1 and x_2

00:34:40.739 --> 00:34:42.969
in terms of that, namely, what?

00:34:42.969 --> 00:34:50.610
x_1 is simply x_3 plus 2, and
x_2 is minus 2*x_3 minus 1.

00:34:50.610 --> 00:34:52.540
In other words,
what this tells me

00:34:52.540 --> 00:34:57.889
is that a whole bunch of vectors
are mapped into (1, 1, 2).

00:34:57.889 --> 00:35:00.430
A whole bunch of 3-tuples-- if
you want to use word "3-tuple"

00:35:00.430 --> 00:35:05.200
rather than vector-- are
mapped into (1, 1, 2) by f bar.

00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:06.920
How are those vectors chosen?

00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:09.840
Well, you can pick the
third component at random,

00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:12.370
in which case, the
first component, x_1,

00:35:12.370 --> 00:35:16.680
is simply x_3 plus 2, and
the second component, x_2,

00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:20.865
is simply minus 2*x_3 minus 1,
where the x_3 is the value that

00:35:20.865 --> 00:35:22.170
you chose here.

00:35:22.170 --> 00:35:24.900
Since there are infinitely
many ways of choosing x_3,

00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:27.010
there are infinitely
many 3-tuples

00:35:27.010 --> 00:35:28.470
that map into (1, 1, 2).

00:35:28.470 --> 00:35:31.320
In particular, f bar is
not one-to-one either,

00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:34.370
which means, in terms of
a picture-- and in fact,

00:35:34.370 --> 00:35:36.640
let's see how we can work
this very comfortably.

00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:39.550
Why not pick x_3 to
be 0 for a start?

00:35:39.550 --> 00:35:42.630
If we pick x_3 to be 0,
notice that this 3-tuple

00:35:42.630 --> 00:35:46.690
becomes (2, -1, 0).

00:35:46.690 --> 00:35:52.390
So (2, -1, 0)-- (2, -1,
0) maps into (1, 1, 2).

00:35:52.390 --> 00:35:58.910
If we pick x_3 to be say,
1, this becomes (3, -3, 1).

00:35:58.910 --> 00:36:03.600
So, for example, (3, -3, 1)
also maps into (1, 1, 2).

00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:08.350
So that's the demonstration
that f bar is not one-to-one.

00:36:08.350 --> 00:36:11.710
And the fact that nothing
maps into (1, 1, 3)

00:36:11.710 --> 00:36:15.550
is the indication that
f bar is not onto.

00:36:15.550 --> 00:36:19.240
By the way, by choosing a
three-dimensional space,

00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:22.330
we can interpret this
result geometrically.

00:36:22.330 --> 00:36:23.880
Now, what I'm
going to do here is

00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:26.000
really optional from
your point of view.

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:28.570
If you don't like studies
of three-dimensional space,

00:36:28.570 --> 00:36:31.585
ignore what I'm
saying, otherwise-- I

00:36:31.585 --> 00:36:32.460
don't mean ignore it.

00:36:32.460 --> 00:36:34.390
Take it with a grain
of salt. Look it over.

00:36:34.390 --> 00:36:34.890
Read it.

00:36:34.890 --> 00:36:37.740
It is not crucial to
understanding abstractly what's

00:36:37.740 --> 00:36:38.500
going on.

00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:43.130
But I thought a visual example
like this might be helpful.

00:36:43.130 --> 00:36:47.000
Notice that when you're
mapping E^3 into E^3,

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:50.150
you're mapping three-dimensional
space into three-dimensional

00:36:50.150 --> 00:36:51.040
space.

00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:53.400
By the way, notice the
n-tuple notation here.

00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:57.930
I prefer to write the x_1,
x_2, x_3 space rather than

00:36:57.930 --> 00:37:00.650
the traditional x, y, z space.

00:37:00.650 --> 00:37:05.920
In other words, f bar is
mapping x_1, x_2, x_3 space

00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:09.800
into y_1, y_2, y_3, space.

00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:12.380
And what we have
shown so far is that,

00:37:12.380 --> 00:37:14.960
with our particular choice of
function under consideration

00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:19.430
now, the only way f bar
maps something into anything

00:37:19.430 --> 00:37:22.280
is if that anything has
what property to it?

00:37:22.280 --> 00:37:26.020
What does the point
(y_1, y_2, y_3)

00:37:26.020 --> 00:37:29.420
have to satisfy in order
that we can be sure

00:37:29.420 --> 00:37:34.420
that something from the x_1,
x_2, x_3 space maps into it?

00:37:34.420 --> 00:37:36.200
And the constraint was what?

00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:39.870
That y_3 equals y_1 plus y_2.

00:37:39.870 --> 00:37:42.790
Now, this is a good time to
review our equation of planes

00:37:42.790 --> 00:37:44.430
in three-dimensional space.

00:37:44.430 --> 00:37:48.200
Sure, we're used to talking
about z equals x plus y.

00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:50.510
But don't worry about
that part notationally.

00:37:50.510 --> 00:37:55.380
y_3 equals y_1 plus y_2 is
the equation of a plane.

00:37:55.380 --> 00:37:57.130
In fact, what plane is it?

00:37:57.130 --> 00:37:59.440
Instead of going into a
long harangue about this,

00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:02.050
let me just find three points
that are on this plane.

00:38:02.050 --> 00:38:06.630
In particular, (0, 0,
0) satisfies this plane.

00:38:06.630 --> 00:38:09.640
(2, 2, 4)-- see, 2 plus 2 is 4.

00:38:09.640 --> 00:38:11.050
1 plus 3 is 4.

00:38:11.050 --> 00:38:14.190
So three quick points I could
pick off are the origin, (2, 2,

00:38:14.190 --> 00:38:16.060
4), (1, 3, 4=.

00:38:16.060 --> 00:38:18.550
These are three points not
on the same straight line.

00:38:18.550 --> 00:38:20.060
They determine the plane.

00:38:20.060 --> 00:38:22.990
The image of f bar is
this particular plane.

00:38:22.990 --> 00:38:25.740
In other words, f bar does
not use up all the free space.

00:38:25.740 --> 00:38:29.860
It, in particular, uses up
this one particular plane.

00:38:29.860 --> 00:38:33.540
In particular, let's look
at our point (1, 1, 2).

00:38:33.540 --> 00:38:37.040
What did we see before
mapped into (1, 1, 2)?

00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:40.910
We saw that any 3-tuple
(x_1, x_2, x_3),

00:38:40.910 --> 00:38:45.170
where we picked x_3 at random,
whereupon x_1 had to be x_3

00:38:45.170 --> 00:38:49.670
plus 2, x_2 had to be
minus 2*x_3 minus 1.

00:38:49.670 --> 00:38:55.840
Notice that this system of
equations defines a line.

00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:58.620
You see, think of x_3 as
being a parameter here.

00:38:58.620 --> 00:39:02.410
If it bothers you,
think of x_3 as being t.

00:39:02.410 --> 00:39:04.815
And what you have is
that x_1 is t plus 2,

00:39:04.815 --> 00:39:09.420
x_2 is minus 2t minus
1, and x_3 is t.

00:39:09.420 --> 00:39:14.370
That is the parametric
form of an equation

00:39:14.370 --> 00:39:15.470
for a straight line.

00:39:15.470 --> 00:39:18.190
You see, notice you have only
one degree of freedom, t,

00:39:18.190 --> 00:39:20.830
and t appears only linearly.

00:39:20.830 --> 00:39:21.660
Now, lookit.

00:39:21.660 --> 00:39:25.810
To find the actual straight line
geometrically, all I have to do

00:39:25.810 --> 00:39:28.030
is find two points on that line.

00:39:28.030 --> 00:39:32.760
To relate this with what we were
doing just previous to this,

00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:34.580
notice that two
points that we know

00:39:34.580 --> 00:39:39.650
are on this line are (2,
-1, 0) and (3, -3, 1).

00:39:39.650 --> 00:39:41.230
Let's look at this graphically.

00:39:41.230 --> 00:39:45.880
Let's locate the point
(2, -1, 0), (3, -3, 1)

00:39:45.880 --> 00:39:48.560
in the x_1, x_2, x_3 space.

00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:51.180
Draw the line that
joins those two points.

00:39:51.180 --> 00:39:55.220
That line l has the property
that every single one

00:39:55.220 --> 00:40:01.000
of these points on l map
into the point (1, 1, 2)

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:04.240
in the y_1, y_2, y_3 space.

00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:06.250
In other words, our
mapping in this case

00:40:06.250 --> 00:40:08.500
is neither one-to-one nor onto.

00:40:08.500 --> 00:40:11.360
The entire image of this
three-dimensional space

00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:13.140
is a single plane.

00:40:13.140 --> 00:40:15.030
And given a point
not in that plane,

00:40:15.030 --> 00:40:17.740
therefore, nothing
maps into that,

00:40:17.740 --> 00:40:22.910
but given a point in that plane,
an entire line from the domain

00:40:22.910 --> 00:40:23.940
maps in there.

00:40:23.940 --> 00:40:27.030
And I simply point this out to
you so that for those of you

00:40:27.030 --> 00:40:29.460
would like to have a
picture of what's happening,

00:40:29.460 --> 00:40:31.420
I think this is a very
nice way of seeing it.

00:40:31.420 --> 00:40:33.970
The reason I don't want to
emphasize the picture more

00:40:33.970 --> 00:40:37.740
is simply because we will deal
in the notes and the exercises

00:40:37.740 --> 00:40:41.510
with systems of more than three
equations and three unknowns.

00:40:41.510 --> 00:40:43.920
We will deal with
linear mapping, say,

00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:46.670
from E^5 into E^5,
in which case,

00:40:46.670 --> 00:40:49.910
we can't draw the picture,
so the picture is only a nice

00:40:49.910 --> 00:40:55.000
mental aid in setting things
up in the 2 by 2 case or the 3

00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:56.070
by 3 case.

00:40:56.070 --> 00:40:58.700
But other than that,
one has to rely

00:40:58.700 --> 00:41:00.890
on the equivalent
of the matrix system

00:41:00.890 --> 00:41:02.330
for reducing these equations.

00:41:02.330 --> 00:41:05.340
So let me summarize, then,
what our main aim was

00:41:05.340 --> 00:41:06.950
and what we have accomplished.

00:41:06.950 --> 00:41:11.570
Leaving out the motivations of
everything for the time being,

00:41:11.570 --> 00:41:14.390
let me just summarize
how we invert a matrix,

00:41:14.390 --> 00:41:17.190
provided that the
matrix inverse exists.

00:41:17.190 --> 00:41:22.050
Given the n by n matrix A,
we form the n by 2n matrix

00:41:22.050 --> 00:41:25.060
A augmented by the n
by n identity matrix.

00:41:25.060 --> 00:41:27.220
In other words,
what matrix is it?

00:41:27.220 --> 00:41:33.690
The left half is a_1 up to
a_(1,n); a_(n,1), a_(n,n).

00:41:33.690 --> 00:41:35.590
In other words,
it's the matrix A.

00:41:35.590 --> 00:41:39.390
And the right half is just
the n by n identity matrix.

00:41:39.390 --> 00:41:41.170
We then row reduce this.

00:41:41.170 --> 00:41:44.380
Remember what mean
by row reduce--

00:41:44.380 --> 00:41:48.750
replacing rows by the
rows plus or minus

00:41:48.750 --> 00:41:51.640
an appropriate multiple
of another row,

00:41:51.640 --> 00:41:55.230
hoping to get the identity
matrix to come over

00:41:55.230 --> 00:41:56.790
to the left-hand side over here.

00:41:56.790 --> 00:41:58.400
We row reduce this matrix.

00:41:58.400 --> 00:42:00.400
And then what we saw was what?

00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:02.020
We did it in the 3 by 3 case.

00:42:02.020 --> 00:42:04.380
We're now doing it
in the n by n case.

00:42:04.380 --> 00:42:07.450
By the way, notice that if
this throws you off abstractly,

00:42:07.450 --> 00:42:11.840
in the 3 by 3 case, the
augmented matrix that we form

00:42:11.840 --> 00:42:13.410
was a 3 by 6.

00:42:13.410 --> 00:42:16.820
All we're saying is in the n
by n case, you're tacking on,

00:42:16.820 --> 00:42:19.350
side by side, two
n by n matrices,

00:42:19.350 --> 00:42:22.190
which makes the
resulting matrix n by 2n.

00:42:22.190 --> 00:42:26.300
At any rate, what we do is
we reduce this n by 2n matrix

00:42:26.300 --> 00:42:28.340
until one of two things happens.

00:42:28.340 --> 00:42:29.960
And one of the two must happen.

00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:34.440
Namely, either the
left-hand half-- this half--

00:42:34.440 --> 00:42:38.620
contains at least one
row of 0's, in which case

00:42:38.620 --> 00:42:41.690
A inverse doesn't exist.

00:42:41.690 --> 00:42:43.370
The other alternative
is that when

00:42:43.370 --> 00:42:47.920
we row reduce, the left-hand
side-- the left half,

00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:51.580
in other words-- does become the
identity matrix, in which case,

00:42:51.580 --> 00:42:53.670
the right half is A inverse.

00:42:53.670 --> 00:42:55.900
That's all there is
to this mechanically.

00:42:55.900 --> 00:42:58.890
You row reduce the
n by 2n matrix.

00:42:58.890 --> 00:42:59.390
All right.

00:42:59.390 --> 00:43:02.490
If the left-hand side
contains a row of 0's, there

00:43:02.490 --> 00:43:04.760
is no inverse to
the given matrix.

00:43:04.760 --> 00:43:07.550
If it reduces to
the identity matrix,

00:43:07.550 --> 00:43:10.850
then the right half
is the inverse matrix.

00:43:10.850 --> 00:43:13.020
Part 2 of our summary--
namely, what can we

00:43:13.020 --> 00:43:14.920
conclude if A inverse exists?

00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:19.730
In terms of matrix algebra, if
A inverse exists, we can solve--

00:43:19.730 --> 00:43:24.620
in other words, we can invert
the equation Y equals A*X

00:43:24.620 --> 00:43:29.130
to conclude that X
equals A inverse Y.

00:43:29.130 --> 00:43:32.590
And finally, in
terms of mappings,

00:43:32.590 --> 00:43:37.740
if we define f bar from
E sub n into E sub n--

00:43:37.740 --> 00:43:40.120
f bar is a mapping from
n-dimensional space

00:43:40.120 --> 00:43:45.570
into n-dimensional
space-- defined by this,

00:43:45.570 --> 00:43:50.920
then f bar inverse exists if
and only if A inverse exists,

00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:54.870
where A is the matrix of
coefficients over here.

00:43:54.870 --> 00:43:58.135
And if A inverse
doesn't exist, then

00:43:58.135 --> 00:44:02.170
f bar inverse not only
doesn't exist, but f bar

00:44:02.170 --> 00:44:05.840
itself is neither
one-to-one nor onto.

00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:10.230
Now, admittedly, today's
lecture was a little bit

00:44:10.230 --> 00:44:11.490
on the long side.

00:44:11.490 --> 00:44:15.360
It was, though, in a sense
a single concept, hopefully

00:44:15.360 --> 00:44:17.320
with many interpretations.

00:44:17.320 --> 00:44:22.290
It is a very, very crucial thing
in many of our investigations

00:44:22.290 --> 00:44:25.110
to do at least
one of two things.

00:44:25.110 --> 00:44:26.730
One thing is going
to be, we are going

00:44:26.730 --> 00:44:30.490
to want to know whether the
inverse of a matrix exists.

00:44:30.490 --> 00:44:32.660
In certain applications,
we will not

00:44:32.660 --> 00:44:35.570
care to know what that
inverse matrix is.

00:44:35.570 --> 00:44:38.980
All we're going to want
to know is, does it exist?

00:44:38.980 --> 00:44:41.330
In that case, that's when
it's sufficient to compute

00:44:41.330 --> 00:44:43.140
the determinant of a matrix.

00:44:43.140 --> 00:44:45.500
Namely, if the determinant
is 0, it doesn't exist.

00:44:45.500 --> 00:44:49.560
If the determinant is not 0,
the inverse matrix does exist.

00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:51.210
On other occasions,
it will not be

00:44:51.210 --> 00:44:54.320
enough to know that
the inverse exists.

00:44:54.320 --> 00:44:58.030
We will also require that
we be able to construct

00:44:58.030 --> 00:45:00.200
A inverse from
the given matrix A

00:45:00.200 --> 00:45:02.910
and that, in essence,
was the lesson that we

00:45:02.910 --> 00:45:04.760
were trying to cover today.

00:45:04.760 --> 00:45:07.240
Starting with our
next lesson, we

00:45:07.240 --> 00:45:11.270
will apply these results
to systems of functions

00:45:11.270 --> 00:45:12.705
of several real variables.

00:45:12.705 --> 00:45:14.680
And until that time, good bye.

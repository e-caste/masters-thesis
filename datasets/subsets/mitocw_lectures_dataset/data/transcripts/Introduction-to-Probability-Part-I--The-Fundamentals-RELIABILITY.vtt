00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:04.170
Independence is a very
useful property.

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.080
Whenever it is true, we can
break up complicated

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.260
situations into simpler ones.

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:12.960
In particular, we can do
separate calculations for each

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.230
piece of a given model and
then combine the results.

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:19.860
We're going to look at an
application of this idea into

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:24.010
the analysis of reliability of
a system that consists of

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:25.960
independent units.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.620
So we have a system that
consists of a number, let's

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:31.430
say, n, of units.

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.650
And each one of the units
can be "up" or "down".

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:38.290
And it's going to be "up" with
a certain probability pi.

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.920
Furthermore, we will assume
that unit failures are

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.240
independent.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.540
Intuitively, what we mean is
that failure of some of the

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:50.000
units does not the affect the
probability that some of the

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.900
other units will fail.

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.860
If we want to be more formal,
we might proceed as follows.

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.080
We could define an event
Ui to be the event that

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.713
the ith unit is "up".

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:13.690
And then make the assumption
that the events U1, U2, and so

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:18.455
on up to Un, if we have n
units, are independent.

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:31.940
Alternatively, we could define
events Fi, where event Fi is

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:37.515
the event that the ith unit is
down, or that it has failed.

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:49.080
And we could assume that the
events Fi are independent, but

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.430
we do not really need a
separate assumption.

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.200
As a consequence of the
assumption that the Ui's are

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.520
independent, one can argue
that the Fi's are also

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.240
independent.

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.520
How do we know that
this is the case?

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:11.280
If we were dealing with just two
units, then this is a fact

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.250
that we have already proved
a little earlier.

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.690
We did prove that if two events
are independent, then

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.150
their complements are
also independent.

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.310
Now that we're dealing with
multiple events here, a

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.640
general number n,
how do we argue?

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.150
One approach would be to be
formal and start from the

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.560
definition of independence
of the U events.

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.210
And that definition gives
us a number of formulas.

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:43.750
Then manipulate those formulas
to prove the conditions that

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.140
are required in order to check
that the events Fi are

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:48.420
independent.

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.230
This is certainly possible,
although it is a bit tedious.

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.440
However, the approach we will
be taking in situations like

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.950
this one is that we will use
the intuitive understanding

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.890
that we have of what
independence means.

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.580
So independence in this context
means that whether

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.760
some units are "up" or down,
does not change the

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.420
probabilities that some
of the other units

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.700
will be "up" or down.

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.800
And by taking that
interpretation, independence

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.160
of the events that units are
"up" is essentially the same

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:25.380
as independence of the
units [having]

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.350
failed.

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:31.620
So we take this implication for
granted and now we move to

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.290
do some calculations for
specific systems.

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.770
Consider a particular system
that consists of three

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:39.950
components.

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:42.770
And we will say that the system
is "up", if there

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:46.050
exists a path from the left to
the right that consists of

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:47.460
units that are "up".

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:50.740
So in this case, for the system
to be "up", we need all

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:55.870
three components to be "up"
and we proceed as follows.

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:00.350
The probability that the
system is "up"--

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:05.730
this is the event that the first
unit is "up", and the

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:10.200
second unit is "up", and
the third unit is "up".

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.990
And now we use independence to
argue that this is equal to

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:18.180
the probability that the first
unit is "up" times the

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.820
probability that the second
unit is "up" times the

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.460
probability that the
third unit is "up".

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.450
And in the notation that we have
introduced this is just

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:31.010
p1 times p2 times p3.

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:34.710
Now, let us consider
a different system.

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:37.870
In this system, we will say
that the system is "up",

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:42.010
again, if there exists a path
from the left to the right

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:44.610
that consists of units
that are "up".

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:48.230
In this particular case the
system will be "up", as long

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:52.940
as at least one of those three
components are "up".

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:56.070
We would like again to calculate
the probability that

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:57.620
the system is "up".

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:08.270
And the system will be "up",
as long as either unit 1 is

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:15.660
"up", or unit 2 is "up",
or unit 3 is "up".

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:18.410
How do we continue from here?

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:21.900
We cannot use independence
readily, because independence

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:24.630
refers to probabilities of
intersections of events,

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:26.990
whereas here we have a union.

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:30.410
How do we turn a union
into an intersection?

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:36.040
This is what De Morgan's Laws
allow us to do, and involves

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:37.690
taking complements.

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:41.000
Instead of using formally De
Morgan's Laws, let's just

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.490
argue directly.

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:45.090
Let us look at this event.

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:50.370
That unit 1 fails, and unit
2 fails, and unit 3 fails.

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:53.710
What is the relation between
this event and the event that

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:55.140
we have here.

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:56.800
They're complements.

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.830
Why is that?

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:04.080
Either all units fail, which is
this event, or there exists

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:07.310
at least one unit,
which is "up".

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:10.860
So since this event is the
complement of that event, this

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:14.740
means that their probabilities
must add to 1, and therefore

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:17.590
we have this relation.

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:20.820
And now we're in better shape,
because we can use the

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:26.910
independence of the events F to
write this as 1 minus the

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:30.190
product of the probabilities
that each one

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:33.190
of the units fails.

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:37.280
And with the notation that we
have introduced using the

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:40.530
pi's, this is as follows.

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:44.200
The probability that unit
1 fails is 1 minus the

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:46.630
probability that it is "up".

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:50.159
Similarly, for the second unit,
1 minus the probability

00:06:50.159 --> 00:06:51.270
that it is "up".

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:52.890
And the same for
the third unit.

00:06:55.770 --> 00:07:00.670
So we have derived a formula
that tells us the reliability,

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:04.660
the probability that a system of
this kind is "up" in terms

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:10.490
of the probabilities of its
individual components.

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:13.450
You will have an opportunity to
deal with more examples of

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:17.290
this kind, a little more
complicated, in the problem

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:18.660
that follows.

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:22.220
And even more complicated, in
one of the problem-solving

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:25.370
videos that we will have
available for you.

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:28.240
PROFESSOR: OK today, teaching
with blackboards and slides.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.729
And also several questions
from the last time.

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:36.090
And, related to that, a handout,
which I've put

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.910
online, which is on how
to make a lesson plan.

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.600
So I'll do all that through
the questions.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.710
So now just a quick bit about
lesson planning, because a

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.410
couple of you pointed out that
you'd have liked to know more

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:53.070
about lesson planning.

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.470
And reminded me that when I
taught the chemistry TA

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:02.580
workshops, I actually gave
everyone a handout on how to

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:03.610
plan a lesson.

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:07.020
So I've put that handout online,
and I'll just show you

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.270
what it looks like here.

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.920
So this is basically the sheet I
use for planning any kind of

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.370
lecture recitation.

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:39.240
At the top, you need some kind
of course, and date.

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.360
And then the objective.

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.880
So that's quite important.

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.010
You'll see the exact sheet.

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:51.220
And there's a PDF file, you
can just use it yourself.

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:56.420
There's a course objective for
that particular session.

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.850
And that relates to your overall
goals for the course.

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.270
So, for example, in this
problem, my objective might be

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:07.420
something like, to show
that easy cases--

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.060
in fact, this was
my objective--

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.130
I wanted to show that
easy cases--

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.060
extreme cases-- are useful not
just for checking formulas,

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.385
but also for generating
formulas.

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.760
OK, so I write that
on the top.

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.930
So I remind myself,
why am I here?

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.180
What am I doing?

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.930
Then there's a three-column
table.

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.660
Basically you just plan
items in your lecture.

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.440
The first column is minutes--

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.660
how long you expect each
thing to take.

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:57.000
And then the middle column, most
of the space is, what's

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.740
your goal in this local
part of the lecture?

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:02.390
And what are you going
to do for that?

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:04.910
So here's my overall
objective.

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:08.130
And my local goal may be,
just this example--

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.180
getting that one third.

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:16.770
And then here in the third
column is props.

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:20.610
So there's actually
a piece here, too.

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.040
So props are anything that
I need to bring.

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.590
So I just stick that
in the margin.

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:27.350
OK, bring the cones,
or the pyramids,

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:28.630
whatever they may be.

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:32.150
And so then, when you're filling
this piece in, about

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.570
what to bring, you just scan
down this last column, and

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:38.630
just write everything here.

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:40.330
OK, cones.

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:44.080
Homework three, solution set
two-- whatever it may be.

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:49.310
So now, at a glance, before you
go to your session, you

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:51.020
review these two things.

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:53.500
Make sure you have everything,
your know why you're here.

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.270
But then here, you're going
to follow your script.

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:57.590
Which is a loose script.

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.830
It's not exactly a word-for-word
script.

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:02.400
It's, maybe, a few equations.

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.650
Suppose there's a question.

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:10.250
What is this constant?

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.900
OK, so that's my overall,
what I'm going to do

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.600
for, say, ten minutes.

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.079
And then I break it into
sub-questions.

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:20.329
OK.

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:25.000
What is H and B?

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.620
How many pyramids do I need?

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:27.740
What's my goal shape?

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:29.510
So these are questions
that I ask students.

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:32.330
And for each one, I write
down the minutes.

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:36.170
Maybe in parentheses, put
the total up here.

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:39.630
So now, when I've done my two
or three pages-- and by the

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:43.900
way I find, just at the level of
detail I use, if I ever go

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:47.810
beyond three pages, I never
get to that material.

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:50.950
So it's just sort of for a
security blanket by the time

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:53.010
I'm beyond three pages.

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:55.330
It depends how detailed you
write these things, but I've

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:58.140
generally found that's
where I am.

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:00.155
And then, you estimate
the time.

00:05:00.155 --> 00:05:02.120
And what you'll find is, the
first time you do stuff,

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.300
you'll massively underestimate
the time.

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:06.960
You'll be off by a
factor of two.

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.070
So, in other words, if you think
it takes five minutes,

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:11.800
it'll really take ten minutes.

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.810
And that's true even after you
take account of this rule.

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:17.620
Sort of.

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:20.970
OK, so then you put down all
your minutes on this page, and

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:21.470
the next page.

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:24.720
You add them up, and you make
sure that you're not over 50,

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:25.980
or whatever the amount is.

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:30.200
And then what you'll find is
what you thought was 50 really

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:32.150
is going to take you 130.

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:34.980
So the next time, when you
evaluate minutes, you'll have

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:35.680
a better idea.

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.220
And you'll find yourself
actually tuning your time

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:40.490
sense pretty well.

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:44.580
So now I've got my time sense
that I don't really need to

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:47.580
put the minutes down, because
I can just do it

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:49.380
by number of pages.

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:50.810
Three pages, too much.

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:54.960
And so you'll find your own
writing level, and detail

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:56.870
level, how many pages to use.

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:59.560
Now the other point is, where do
these questions come from?

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:03.760
OK, well this is a way you can
turn any regular lecture into

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:04.900
an interactive one.

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:06.560
So suppose you have a
long derivation that

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:07.140
you're going to do.

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:11.570
Or, for example, suppose the
first way I planned this, was

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:14.170
I wanted to show people that
this was 1/3 over here, this

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:15.680
is three here.

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:17.950
And the way I was going to do
it, was I was going to draw

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:21.900
six pyramids, show them in a
cube, and show that 6V, and do

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:22.970
all this showing.

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:27.570
Well, first draft, write it all
out like that, with times

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:29.570
and everything, without
questions.

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:33.230
Then, any time you come to
something interesting--

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:34.480
so here.

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:43.075
So before you have [? tel. ?]

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:52.430
So now you look at your sheet,
and you say, hmm, where did

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:53.930
something interesting happen?

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:56.940
Hopefully, there is at
least one point.

00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:58.950
Because if there isn't, maybe
you shouldn't be giving the

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:00.400
lecture at all.

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:03.280
So now, let's just say, by
construction, you found some

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:04.030
interesting things.

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:05.700
OK, so that's interesting.

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:07.800
Oh, it's interesting that
it makes a cube--

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:09.800
it's not obvious.

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:13.300
So just think, where does
something require thought, and

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:16.220
that you're short-circuiting
the thought by telling.

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:20.980
So then, what I do is I have a
green pen, and I turn it into

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:22.310
a question.

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:27.710
So I'll circle it in green, and
write, "ask" next to it.

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:29.800
OK, or you can just rewrite
your sheet.

00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:42.470
Telling something, then asking,
and then continuing.

00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:45.190
OK so that's how you can turn
any regular lecture into an

00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:46.170
interactive one.

00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:49.470
And that's your sheet that
you walk into class with.

00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:51.860
And what you'll find, is that
the first time you do it that

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:54.900
way, there will be a bunch more
spots you realize were

00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:55.680
actually subtle.

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:59.250
Because, for example, at the end
of class session, when you

00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:01.110
collect your feedback sheets,
people will have questions

00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:01.830
about different parts.

00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:04.290
You'll realize, oh, there was
actually something interesting

00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:06.000
that happened that wasn't
obvious in one of these

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:06.980
telling points.

00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:10.880
And you'll be able to turn that
into a question, as well.

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:15.360
The master sheet with all that
formatted for you is online,

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:16.710
on the course website.

00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:18.970
And you're welcome to use that
in your own teaching, and

00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:22.280
distribute it to everyone you
know Any questions about that?

00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:25.810
Yes.

00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:28.270
AUDIENCE: When you run over
time, then you have to shift

00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:29.668
some of the things to
the next lecture.

00:08:29.668 --> 00:08:32.520
So how do you do that?

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:35.289
PROFESSOR: What happens when
you run over time.

00:08:35.289 --> 00:08:37.669
The first time you teach the
course, you basically find out

00:08:37.669 --> 00:08:39.714
there's just twice as much
material in the course as

00:08:39.714 --> 00:08:40.669
there should be.

00:08:40.669 --> 00:08:42.940
And you'll always be running
over time if you try to cover

00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:45.060
every single thing.

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:48.080
So, the first time you
run out of time--

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:49.160
there's two approaches to it.

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:55.290
One is just to slow the entire
pace down, and cover half of

00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:56.280
the amount of material.

00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:58.400
So that's quite a reasonable
approach.

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:01.170
The other is to sort of keep
rhythm, but not cover every

00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:01.870
single thing.

00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:04.480
So my piano teacher, a while
ago, she said, when you're

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:07.310
sight-reading new piano music,
the most important thing is,

00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:08.090
keep rhythm.

00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:11.310
So don't just stop, and then
think for like ten seconds

00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:13.050
about one measure, and
then continue in

00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:14.220
this herk and jerk.

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:17.280
Just keep playing at speed, but
skip some of the notes,

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:18.910
and do whatever you have
to do to keep rhythm.

00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:21.880
So you can try that
approach too.

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:24.340
And then, what you do is you
say, OK look I'm not going to

00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:25.850
cover every single
thing in lecture.

00:09:25.850 --> 00:09:28.070
A lot of stuff is in the book.

00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:29.680
And that's good to do anyway.

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:32.910
So a mix of the two approaches
is one way to deal with

00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:34.120
running over time.

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:34.610
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:37.250
So each lecture you have
some objective.

00:09:37.250 --> 00:09:40.410
And then, if you run over
time, then in the first

00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:41.850
lecture, you only finish
half of it.

00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:44.812
And then, the second one seems
to start from the middle of

00:09:44.812 --> 00:09:46.780
[INAUDIBLE].

00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:48.740
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:48.970
OK.

00:09:48.970 --> 00:09:50.590
So that's one reason
it's worth writing

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:52.160
the objective first.

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:53.750
Because then you know what
the main goal is.

00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:56.330
So one way to do it,
which I do like, is

00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:58.110
to make sure that--

00:09:58.110 --> 00:10:00.710
right away-- the objective
is reached.

00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:03.040
So you do it as sort
of a layer cake.

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:04.510
So the first example--

00:10:04.510 --> 00:10:06.640
maybe the first two examples--

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:09.750
just from those, if everybody
just doesn't do anything else

00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:11.920
but the first two examples,
which you expect will only

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:13.030
take 15 minutes--

00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:15.320
but it takes 40 minutes,
it's okay.

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:18.620
Because the first two examples
reach your objective.

00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:21.130
Now they don't reach the
objective 100%, but they give

00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:22.810
you 80% of the objective.

00:10:22.810 --> 00:10:26.430
So you want to plan your lecture
structure like a layer

00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:30.670
cake, or like JPEG.

00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:32.790
People know how JPEG
compression works?

00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:38.390
So JPEG, the way you do it, is
the low-frequency, quote,

00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:41.090
"most important" terms,
come first.

00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:44.470
And then the higher-frequency,
say, less important terms,

00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:45.060
come later.

00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:47.810
So sometimes you see things
rendered in your browser

00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:50.660
step-by-step, and they just
sort of take focus.

00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:53.960
And it gets better and better as
you wait longer and longer.

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:56.050
So you want to plan your
lecture a bit that way.

00:10:56.050 --> 00:10:58.970
So that it's robust
to time shortage.

00:10:58.970 --> 00:11:01.850
So that if, for example, there's
a fire alarm halfway

00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:04.480
through your lecture, still
the main point got across.

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:06.740
Now it didn't get across in
all the detail, and the

00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:09.840
beautiful glory of that you
wanted, but the main point

00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:11.480
still got across.

00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:14.000
So then, if you run out
of time, it's OK.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.330
You say, look, there's two more
examples of this which we

00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:19.190
didn't do, but they further
illustrate the main point.

00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:21.420
See the notes.

00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:23.990
And then you can keep
to your plan.

00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:25.740
Assuming that your plan
is a reasonable one.

00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:28.480
If your plan is that, I'm going
to do f equals ma today,

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:33.130
and I'm going to do rigid body
rotation tomorrow, that's

00:11:33.130 --> 00:11:34.610
probably not a reasonable
plan.

00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:36.695
And the fact that you ran out of
time on day one is probably

00:11:36.695 --> 00:11:39.690
a good sign that you should
actually spend a little more

00:11:39.690 --> 00:11:41.840
time on f equals ma.

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:43.880
Does that answer
your question?

00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:45.980
Other questions?

00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:47.308
Yes.

00:11:47.308 --> 00:11:48.980
AUDIENCE: I have a question
about [INAUDIBLE]?

00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:51.894
A lot of people have told me
over the years that it's good

00:11:51.894 --> 00:11:52.876
to write really big.

00:11:52.876 --> 00:11:54.490
And I know you're constrained by
that the people have to be

00:11:54.490 --> 00:11:55.335
able to see.

00:11:55.335 --> 00:11:58.020
But, given that you're writing
large enough for them to see,

00:11:58.020 --> 00:12:00.569
what's the advantage of writing
any bigger than that?

00:12:00.569 --> 00:12:02.421
As opposed to having
the [INAUDIBLE]?

00:12:05.730 --> 00:12:07.290
PROFESSOR: OK, so that's
a good question.

00:12:07.290 --> 00:12:09.860
Actually, why don't
we save that.

00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:11.830
We'll talk about that today.

00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:15.180
So the question was, how
big should you write?

00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:18.260
Just enough so people
can see, or bigger?

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:21.790
So that you can keep the
full story there.

00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:26.310
OK, so, any other questions
on the lecture planning?

00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:28.740
And blackboard, and slides,
we'll come to

00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:29.990
starting right now.

00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:39.870
Teaching with slides
and blackboards.

00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:43.170
What are the advantages, and
disadvantages of each.

00:12:43.170 --> 00:12:47.440
I'll tell you my bottom line,
which is that my zero-th order

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:49.330
term, so this is
my objective--

00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:52.880
if the lecture ends after the
next two minutes, at least

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:54.580
you'll have the zero-th
order term.

00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:58.550
The zero-th order term is
that, if you can't help

00:12:58.550 --> 00:13:02.880
yourself, use slides, but
otherwise, use blackboard.

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:08.260
For 90% of things, blackboard
is much better for teaching

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.120
than slides.

00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:12.820
There are some cases where
slides are useful, and you can

00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:13.890
make an argument for it.

00:13:13.890 --> 00:13:16.920
There's some cases where maybe
the slide is as good as a

00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:19.700
blackboard, few cases where it's
better than a blackboard.

00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:22.220
But the default is, blackboards

00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:24.790
are better than slides.

00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:28.255
Now let me show you an example
of why that's true.

00:13:33.070 --> 00:13:35.170
Suppose you're teaching the--

00:13:35.170 --> 00:13:37.760
an example I've done with you
before, slightly, is the

00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:39.010
Navier-Stokes equation.

00:13:58.200 --> 00:13:59.952
Let me write it down,
to start with.

00:14:03.656 --> 00:14:05.912
Actually, I'll put it on
a separate blackboard.

00:14:09.690 --> 00:14:11.380
So there's our topic.

00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:13.610
So we always know what our
topic is, because it's up

00:14:13.610 --> 00:14:15.990
there, and it's just going
to live there for a bit.

00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:17.740
And in fact, in some
classrooms--

00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:21.220
you can't do it so easily
here, but my favorite

00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:25.240
classroom is 4-265 because it
has pretty much this much

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:27.810
blackboards in the front, and it
has blackboards all around

00:14:27.810 --> 00:14:29.060
the side, and on the back.

00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:31.450
So I don't use the back ones so
much, but the side ones are

00:14:31.450 --> 00:14:32.750
really, really useful.

00:14:32.750 --> 00:14:35.570
Because you can, for example,
put the topic, like I've done

00:14:35.570 --> 00:14:39.080
here, on the side blackboard,
and just let it stay there the

00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:40.180
entire time.

00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:41.980
You can put an outline
of the lecture.

00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:43.600
OK, so let's say we
have a lecture on

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:44.750
Navier-Stokes equation.

00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:46.330
We want to look at them,
try to understand them.

00:15:10.010 --> 00:15:12.813
So here are the equation.

00:15:12.813 --> 00:15:16.580
Well "are," "is," the plural
is a bit ambiguous.

00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:19.980
This is actually three
equations, one because it's a

00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:21.980
vector, vector, vector.

00:15:26.690 --> 00:15:30.920
Already there, you see something
that's harder to do

00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:31.990
with slides.

00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:33.880
You'd have to work harder
to do that in slides.

00:15:36.890 --> 00:15:42.450
You can just go back, and
annotate as you go.

00:15:42.450 --> 00:15:46.100
And here, you can see the entire
topic while you're

00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:46.820
looking at this.

00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:50.430
So, for example, the student has
now got overwhelmed by all

00:15:50.430 --> 00:15:52.456
the little symbols here--

00:15:52.456 --> 00:15:57.030
the del squared, the partial
derivative, the v dot grad--

00:15:57.030 --> 00:15:59.820
that part always scared me when
I was a physics student.

00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:04.840
I knew what del dot v is,
but what's v dot del?

00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:06.940
So you get scared by all that.

00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:09.050
And then people forget,
they panic.

00:16:09.050 --> 00:16:11.200
Because their short-term term
memory got filled with every

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:12.520
single, little, chunk here.

00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:15.080
Their chunks are, remember,
very small.

00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:17.720
And they forgot, what
are they doing?

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:20.000
Navier-Stokes equation
fluid mechanics.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:20.690
OK.

00:16:20.690 --> 00:16:28.180
And now, you can even improve
that first blackboard by

00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:32.660
talking about, what does
this apply to?

00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:43.845
Drag, turbulence, river
flow, airplanes.

00:16:47.930 --> 00:16:49.270
So here, you can have a

00:16:49.270 --> 00:16:51.070
reminder of why it's important.

00:16:51.070 --> 00:16:53.790
So now that just stays up
there the whole time.

00:16:53.790 --> 00:16:56.370
And people can re-center
themselves every time they get

00:16:56.370 --> 00:16:58.670
confused of what they're
doing, just by that.

00:16:58.670 --> 00:17:00.640
And then, you can continue.

00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:04.220
You can say, OK, let me
try to explain the

00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:05.280
meaning of these terms.

00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:08.000
So let's do the terms
one at a time.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.250
What's this?

00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:20.680
So this term here is Dvdt.

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:22.530
We've seen things like that--
that's sort of like an

00:17:22.530 --> 00:17:23.780
acceleration.

00:17:31.370 --> 00:17:34.510
You can annotate the equation
right there.

00:17:34.510 --> 00:17:38.360
That's also hard to
do on a slide.

00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:40.930
I mean, you can do it, you can
work at it, but it's very

00:17:40.930 --> 00:17:42.730
natural on a chalkboard.

00:17:42.730 --> 00:17:45.450
Now, there's some things that
are common to chalkboards and

00:17:45.450 --> 00:17:49.230
slides, which is the
use of color.

00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:51.870
So now this, unfortunately,
is blue, which is

00:17:51.870 --> 00:17:53.466
not the ideal color.

00:17:53.466 --> 00:17:55.860
Unfortunately, I
don't have my--

00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:58.950
orange is generally better,
but anyway I have blue.

00:17:58.950 --> 00:18:01.900
Can you see the blue?

00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:04.530
So marginally?

00:18:04.530 --> 00:18:07.030
Maybe this orange, even though
it's not as big, will be

00:18:07.030 --> 00:18:08.000
better than the blue.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.600
OK, well this shows you an
example of color, and the

00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:12.570
importance of choosing
the right color.

00:18:12.570 --> 00:18:14.200
There used to be a green
one here, but

00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:16.770
they're isn't green anymore.

00:18:16.770 --> 00:18:19.440
Blue is not ideal, I
won't use the blue.

00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:21.610
Let's try this.

00:18:21.610 --> 00:18:23.450
Is that better?

00:18:23.450 --> 00:18:24.200
OK.

00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:27.620
So let me use this orange one,
and I'll try to write large,

00:18:27.620 --> 00:18:29.230
even though it's not as bold.

00:18:29.230 --> 00:18:31.260
OK, so the use of color.

00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:34.710
That's important in both
slides and blackboard.

00:18:34.710 --> 00:18:35.960
What's the use of color here?

00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:38.930
Is it just because it's nice
to have a pretty picture?

00:18:38.930 --> 00:18:39.570
No.

00:18:39.570 --> 00:18:43.000
The reason for using the color
is that you get layering.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:48.030
So again, remember the
students' dilemma.

00:18:48.030 --> 00:18:50.220
Pretty much all students'
dilemma come from the

00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:52.730
following problem, which
is that their

00:18:52.730 --> 00:18:56.250
chunk size is one symbol.

00:18:56.250 --> 00:18:58.180
You've been teaching the
Navier-Stokes equation for 20

00:18:58.180 --> 00:19:01.380
years, your chunk size is
the entire equation.

00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:01.620
Right?

00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:03.170
So that's one chunk to you,
you just write it

00:19:03.170 --> 00:19:04.520
down, like I just did.

00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:06.300
But for the student, every
single, little

00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:07.630
thing is one symbol.

00:19:07.630 --> 00:19:11.340
So now, if you then write all
of this stuff in the same

00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:14.100
color, as your rest of your
equation, it just

00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:14.980
becomes more stuff.

00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:16.220
They don't know how to
separate it into

00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:17.670
two different objects.

00:19:17.670 --> 00:19:21.820
But, if you write your labels in
a different color, it pops

00:19:21.820 --> 00:19:22.840
out in a different layer.

00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:24.720
They know that lives in a
different space, so you're

00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:27.680
already helping them chunk.

00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:28.930
So what is this?

00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:34.290
This is also a change in v.
So it's sort of like an

00:19:34.290 --> 00:19:35.200
acceleration.

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:36.830
Well, it's part of the
acceleration, actually.

00:19:41.410 --> 00:19:42.970
So this is another
acceleration.

00:19:42.970 --> 00:19:45.780
It's a change in v, but it's a
change in v because you've

00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:47.880
moved to a new place.

00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:50.560
So this is a change in v
because you waited--

00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:51.960
you move to a new time.

00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:54.930
This is a change in v because a
little piece of fluid moved

00:19:54.930 --> 00:19:57.250
to new place, where the fluid
velocity is different.

00:19:57.250 --> 00:19:59.320
So these two things together
are two different

00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:02.710
contributions to the change in
v. So we'll actually call this

00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:14.370
whole thing D of vdt, which is
actually its actual name.

00:20:14.370 --> 00:20:16.560
So this is an acceleration.

00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:20.370
These are the two pieces of it--
this is the acceleration.

00:20:20.370 --> 00:20:23.030
What's on the other side?

00:20:23.030 --> 00:20:26.070
Well, this guy, pressure--

00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:27.420
p is pressure--

00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:28.360
grading of pressure.

00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:29.910
So that's the differences
in pressure.

00:20:29.910 --> 00:20:33.150
So that's going to do some kind
of thing, like a force.

00:20:33.150 --> 00:20:34.580
And row is density.

00:20:34.580 --> 00:20:36.430
So you're taking a force--

00:20:36.430 --> 00:20:42.820
I'll put it in quotes, because
it's not quite a force, it's

00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:44.180
sort of force per area.

00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:53.510
But now you divide by density,
and you get f over m.

00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:55.150
So f over m.

00:20:55.150 --> 00:21:00.860
So we have, here this guy--

00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:06.360
acceleration is equal
to f over m.

00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:09.360
Do you recognize that
equation before?

00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:11.140
Yes, Newton's Second Law.

00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:16.680
So this whole thing, so far
here, is just this is a

00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:17.710
equals f over m.

00:21:17.710 --> 00:21:21.440
So this is the pressure forces,
and this must be the--

00:21:30.550 --> 00:21:32.880
and this is the viscous forces
divided by the mass.

00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:34.740
So these are the two
contributors to the forces--

00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:37.490
pressure forces, viscous
forces--

00:21:37.490 --> 00:21:39.290
and those produce the
acceleration.

00:21:39.290 --> 00:21:43.110
So the Navier-Stokes equation
comes out just as Newton's

00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:45.260
Second Law all over again.

00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:49.220
So now, this kind of drawing
is quite difficult

00:21:49.220 --> 00:21:49.960
to do in the slide.

00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:50.270
Yes.

00:21:50.270 --> 00:21:51.990
AUDIENCE: So I actually
would argue with you.

00:21:51.990 --> 00:21:54.110
You could prepare a set of
slides with annotations, and

00:21:54.110 --> 00:21:55.360
then you could do everything.

00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:57.692
You could put all the
information [INAUDIBLE] in a

00:21:57.692 --> 00:21:59.360
slide, or in multiple slides.

00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:00.860
[INAUDIBLE] animation.

00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:01.120
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:03.520
So you could put them on
multiple slides, and then flip

00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:06.170
to it, one by one That's true.

00:22:09.650 --> 00:22:11.980
So you can do it, which is
why I said you can do

00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:13.320
it, but it's hard.

00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:15.600
Because it is a bit of a pain,
and you can do it.

00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:20.720
OK but then the problem is, you
want to now leave that on.

00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:24.990
So now you want to have not only
this, but you also want

00:22:24.990 --> 00:22:27.830
to have this, and leave it on
for the entire lecture.

00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:30.610
Because this is the meaning
of the terms.

00:22:30.610 --> 00:22:32.400
And now you're going to leave it
there, and talk about each

00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:33.800
term, one by one.

00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:34.130
Yes

00:22:34.130 --> 00:22:36.754
AUDIENCE: But you could also
give them a handout, with all

00:22:36.754 --> 00:22:38.558
the slides there, so
they would have

00:22:38.558 --> 00:22:39.542
everything in front of them.

00:22:39.542 --> 00:22:42.002
And if they ever want to go
back, they can look back on

00:22:42.002 --> 00:22:44.462
the previous slide.

00:22:44.462 --> 00:22:47.890
[INAUDIBLE] but I think so far
this is not a strong argument

00:22:47.890 --> 00:22:49.342
against the slides.

00:22:49.342 --> 00:22:51.762
Maybe the question's about
interactivity.

00:22:51.762 --> 00:22:53.698
If somebody asks you
a question, what

00:22:53.698 --> 00:22:55.150
about the third term?

00:22:55.150 --> 00:22:57.710
If you don't have a slide
for that, then--

00:22:57.710 --> 00:22:57.980
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:22:57.980 --> 00:23:02.340
And this is the point
I'm coming to.

00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:03.100
So there's that.

00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:05.480
And I agree with you, you can
do this with slides, you can

00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:07.190
give people a handout.

00:23:07.190 --> 00:23:14.020
Though the problem with
the handout--

00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:17.730
suppose you put all of this on
the handout for them, so that

00:23:17.730 --> 00:23:21.160
now, when you erase this screen,
and that screen, you

00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:22.910
go to another thing they
still have something to

00:23:22.910 --> 00:23:24.040
refer back to you.

00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:28.710
The problem is that you want
it all in one visual field.

00:23:28.710 --> 00:23:31.280
And you don't have that when
it's on a handout.

00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:34.770
So you have a problem
of split attention.

00:23:34.770 --> 00:23:38.150
So now the student's attention
is switching between the

00:23:38.150 --> 00:23:40.270
screen, and the handout--

00:23:40.270 --> 00:23:41.300
screen and handout.

00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:45.450
And when they look at the
screen, they're trying to

00:23:45.450 --> 00:23:47.110
remember what they're
confused about.

00:23:47.110 --> 00:23:50.280
And now they look
at the handout.

00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:52.460
This is the analogy.

00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:57.650
When I was in Prague, I would
look at a street sign, and I

00:23:57.650 --> 00:24:00.230
would read the word, and look
at all the letters.

00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:00.860
[INAUDIBLE]

00:24:00.860 --> 00:24:01.940
or something like that.

00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:04.610
And I would look away.

00:24:04.610 --> 00:24:08.420
Two seconds later, I could not
remember more than one letter

00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:10.430
that I saw on the
street sign--

00:24:10.430 --> 00:24:11.170
on the street name.

00:24:11.170 --> 00:24:15.460
The reason is, because each of
the letters was random to me.

00:24:15.460 --> 00:24:18.430
So, yes, someone who's Czech,
just says, oh yeah, that's

00:24:18.430 --> 00:24:19.840
Main Street, of course.

00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:20.520
No big deal.

00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:21.225
What's there to remember?

00:24:21.225 --> 00:24:23.660
It's Main Street, it's
in the Main Square.

00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:26.810
Whereas me, as the foreigner,
has no clue.

00:24:26.810 --> 00:24:28.310
And it's all new data to me.

00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:30.140
So it's the same way
for the students.

00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:31.760
This is all new to them.

00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:33.430
So when they're looking
at something else,

00:24:33.430 --> 00:24:34.900
you're talking about--

00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:36.550
you're going to discuss,
what's the

00:24:36.550 --> 00:24:37.800
dimensions of this term?

00:24:48.740 --> 00:24:51.410
They look at this thing, and now
you have a big analysis of

00:24:51.410 --> 00:24:53.140
the dimensions of this, you
want to check that all the

00:24:53.140 --> 00:24:55.610
dimensions are right, and your
goal is eventually to work out

00:24:55.610 --> 00:24:57.020
the dimensions of this--

00:24:57.020 --> 00:25:00.300
viscosity, let's say.

00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:02.790
They might be frightened
of the partial.

00:25:02.790 --> 00:25:05.750
So they look at this, and they
say, oh, yeah, where does the

00:25:05.750 --> 00:25:07.160
Dvdt come from?

00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:09.100
And then they look back at their
handout, and they've

00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:12.190
already forgotten pretty
much what this was.

00:25:12.190 --> 00:25:14.170
Because they are
the foreigner.

00:25:14.170 --> 00:25:17.580
They are the tourist
in this land.

00:25:17.580 --> 00:25:18.372
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:25:18.372 --> 00:25:21.264
I was just going say that
I would have said

00:25:21.264 --> 00:25:23.674
something very similar.

00:25:23.674 --> 00:25:26.566
The annotation part of it is to
[INAUDIBLE] slides at all,

00:25:26.566 --> 00:25:28.814
because if I was making slides
for this lecture, I would've

00:25:28.814 --> 00:25:29.833
done exactly what you did.

00:25:29.833 --> 00:25:33.850
But it would all be nicely
spaced, and there would be no

00:25:33.850 --> 00:25:35.531
handwriting issues.

00:25:35.531 --> 00:25:37.170
So if anything, slides would
be better for that.

00:25:37.170 --> 00:25:41.565
But I think that the argument
for slides is [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:41.565 --> 00:25:44.340
having them linger on,
but also pacing.

00:25:44.340 --> 00:25:46.544
Like, the fact that it doesn't
flip up so quickly, because

00:25:46.544 --> 00:25:48.249
the [INAUDIBLE] that I've taken
where they use slides

00:25:48.249 --> 00:25:50.684
and use [INAUDIBLE], it goes by
so quickly that you have no

00:25:50.684 --> 00:25:53.119
chance to internalize.

00:25:53.119 --> 00:25:55.885
The fact that you have to write
it out by hand forces

00:25:55.885 --> 00:25:57.970
you to slow down, in a
way that is really

00:25:57.970 --> 00:25:59.100
helpful for the listener.

00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:00.010
And so that's something that's
really important [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:00.010 --> 00:26:01.180
difference.

00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:01.410
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:26:01.410 --> 00:26:03.960
And that's a fundamentally
important point about pacing.

00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:07.130
And this partly addresses
your question about how

00:26:07.130 --> 00:26:08.200
big should you write.

00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:10.340
So one of the reasons for
writing big, is that you're

00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:12.740
writing slower.

00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:15.640
And writing slower, generally
forces your pace to match the

00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:20.610
pace that is absorbable
by the students.

00:26:20.610 --> 00:26:25.040
So I'll come back to that point
in just one second.

00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:29.710
So let me just finish the point
about the visual field.

00:26:29.710 --> 00:26:33.620
The good thing about the
blackboard is, you could call

00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:35.650
it cognitive offloading.

00:26:35.650 --> 00:26:38.610
In one glance, everything
that the students

00:26:38.610 --> 00:26:40.690
need, can be there.

00:26:40.690 --> 00:26:43.090
So they don't really have
to remember much.

00:26:43.090 --> 00:26:46.320
And the short-term memory
isn't overfull.

00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:47.130
They're registers.

00:26:47.130 --> 00:26:49.160
They're a low-register
machine.

00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:52.420
Or rather, they have the same
number of registers as us, but

00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:53.250
they don't store as much

00:26:53.250 --> 00:26:55.530
information in their registers.

00:26:55.530 --> 00:26:58.540
So their registers don't get
overfull, because everything's

00:26:58.540 --> 00:26:59.010
right there.

00:26:59.010 --> 00:27:01.930
Whereas there is a much bigger
danger of register overfilling

00:27:01.930 --> 00:27:03.440
with slides.

00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:05.430
Then, as you point out,
there's the issue of

00:27:05.430 --> 00:27:06.520
interactivity.

00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:11.410
So this is partly a performance
question.

00:27:11.410 --> 00:27:19.160
Slides, not only are they
much more pre-prepared--

00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:21.500
I mean, you can prepare your
blackboards, as well, but you

00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:23.400
actually do have to re-perform
it each time.

00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:25.840
Whereas a slide, as you say, you
just click to Return, or

00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:28.280
Next, and there you are,
at the next slide.

00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:31.460
So there's much less
performance in it.

00:27:31.460 --> 00:27:35.040
And it seems much more
pre-scripted.

00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:38.020
Now, what does that signal
to the students?

00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:39.140
The pre-scripting.

00:27:39.140 --> 00:27:42.360
It says to the students, look,
this is all one, tight thing.

00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:47.390
It's sort of like a play on
a stage, that you're only

00:27:47.390 --> 00:27:50.520
supposed to applaud at
particular times.

00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:51.900
A modern-day play.

00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:54.640
Back in Elizabethan times, in
Shakespeare's time, people

00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:56.980
cheered, and screamed, and
cat-called, and it was a much

00:27:56.980 --> 00:27:58.940
more lively thing
on the stage.

00:27:58.940 --> 00:28:03.500
But now, everyone sits really
quiet, God help you if you

00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:06.820
cough, you try to wait, and you
think about your coughing,

00:28:06.820 --> 00:28:08.500
and then you don't think about
the play, and you try to

00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:09.480
prevent your coughing.

00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:12.650
So all that transfers a bit.

00:28:12.650 --> 00:28:16.830
That same mentality comes when
you're using slides.

00:28:16.830 --> 00:28:19.520
People think, oh my God, this is
a pre-scripted thing-- how

00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:23.230
dare I intervene, and
break into that.

00:28:23.230 --> 00:28:25.690
So if your goal is to encourage
students to

00:28:25.690 --> 00:28:27.950
question, it's harder to
do that with slides.

00:28:27.950 --> 00:28:29.480
You still can do it.

00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:31.470
You can, for example, put
questions on the slides-- and

00:28:31.470 --> 00:28:33.570
you definitely should do that
you're going to use slides--

00:28:33.570 --> 00:28:38.860
but the random, spontaneous
character of your session--

00:28:38.860 --> 00:28:40.390
the good side of that,
is going to be

00:28:40.390 --> 00:28:41.640
minimized by the slides.

00:28:46.220 --> 00:28:49.410
So this one was just to continue
saying, OK, now we're

00:28:49.410 --> 00:28:52.280
going to leave these two on,
and we're going to do the

00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:53.680
dimensions of each term.

00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:58.530
I have one, two, three,
four, let's say--

00:28:58.530 --> 00:29:00.110
four terms I want
to talk about.

00:29:00.110 --> 00:29:03.470
I'll do the dimensions of
two terms on this board,

00:29:03.470 --> 00:29:06.300
dimensions of two terms on that
board, now I'll have all

00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:07.900
the dimensions there.

00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:10.400
And now I can start, for
example, doing dimensional

00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:12.340
analysis on this side
of the room.

00:29:12.340 --> 00:29:16.890
And we'll eventually get to the
Reynolds number, which is

00:29:16.890 --> 00:29:19.490
vr over nu.

00:29:19.490 --> 00:29:21.510
Once we know this guy's
dimensions.

00:29:21.510 --> 00:29:23.810
And v, we know his dimensions,
r the size of

00:29:23.810 --> 00:29:24.880
your sphere or something.

00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:26.540
So this is dimensionless.

00:29:32.490 --> 00:29:35.820
Now you've got the Reynolds
number, you've also got, say,

00:29:35.820 --> 00:29:39.990
drag coefficient, which is
f over 1/2 [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:39.990 --> 00:29:42.620
v squared times some area.

00:29:42.620 --> 00:29:44.480
So this is also dimensionless.

00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:46.780
So now, you have two
dimensionless things.

00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:49.855
And then finally,
the finale is--

00:30:24.530 --> 00:30:27.920
So now, let's say by the end of
the lecture, you get to the

00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:30.510
point where you've plotted
the drag coefficient, a

00:30:30.510 --> 00:30:33.270
dimensionless thing, versus
the Reynolds number, on a

00:30:33.270 --> 00:30:35.710
log-log scale.

00:30:35.710 --> 00:30:38.200
And then you can talk about
this, you can go back and you

00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:39.210
say, OK, well what is this?

00:30:39.210 --> 00:30:40.080
This is really interesting.

00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:41.210
It looks like it was constant.

00:30:41.210 --> 00:30:42.440
And then what happened?

00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:44.150
Well, you can go back
and talk about that.

00:30:44.150 --> 00:30:47.430
And as you talk about it, the
entire graph is visible to

00:30:47.430 --> 00:30:50.720
everyone, as well as the source
of all the pieces of

00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:52.500
the graph, which is all the--

00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:53.770
why is everything
dimensionless?

00:30:53.770 --> 00:30:55.350
Well, you have it on
these two boards.

00:30:55.350 --> 00:30:57.450
And what are the terms
that you used?

00:30:57.450 --> 00:30:58.650
Well, those are all on there.

00:30:58.650 --> 00:31:02.410
So all of that is visible
in one glance.

00:31:02.410 --> 00:31:07.160
So that's an example of
something that is hard to do

00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:08.880
in the slides.

00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:10.985
Now, it's not easy to
get it right on

00:31:10.985 --> 00:31:11.800
the blackboard, either.

00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:13.550
You do have to plan.

00:31:13.550 --> 00:31:15.960
You have to plan by saying,
what am I going

00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:17.670
to put on each board?

00:31:17.670 --> 00:31:19.910
And how am I going to structure
the boards?

00:31:19.910 --> 00:31:23.010
But you can do that on your
lesson plan, for example, on

00:31:23.010 --> 00:31:24.410
the back of the lesson plan.

00:31:24.410 --> 00:31:26.370
Say, OK, how many boards
do I have?

00:31:26.370 --> 00:31:28.000
And what am I going to use?

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:31.830
And then, if you want to take
advantage of the fact that

00:31:31.830 --> 00:31:34.660
everything is visible all the
time, you generally don't want

00:31:34.660 --> 00:31:37.430
to use the up-and-down
nature of the board.

00:31:37.430 --> 00:31:41.670
You just want to use two boards
on each of the regions.

00:31:41.670 --> 00:31:45.750
If you push this up, and start
writing on this guy, you're

00:31:45.750 --> 00:31:47.580
now OK, still.

00:31:47.580 --> 00:31:51.560
But then, when you push this
up, and you write on here,

00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:54.480
you've covered this guy up.

00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:56.620
And yes, you've lost some
of that advantage.

00:31:56.620 --> 00:31:59.520
Again, you can plan it out,
and do a trade off.

00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:03.870
But that is harder to
do with slides.

00:32:03.870 --> 00:32:08.210
Now, your question about how big
you should write so that

00:32:08.210 --> 00:32:11.580
everyone can see, versus telling
the whole story.

00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:14.510
I think it is important to try
to tell the whole story.

00:32:14.510 --> 00:32:17.330
It doesn't have to be the entire
lecture sits on the set

00:32:17.330 --> 00:32:20.610
of blackboards, but a coherent
chunk of the lecture should

00:32:20.610 --> 00:32:21.860
sit on the blackboards.

00:32:23.870 --> 00:32:25.510
You have two things
you could control.

00:32:25.510 --> 00:32:28.990
One you can control is the
writing size, and the other is

00:32:28.990 --> 00:32:30.740
what you write down.

00:32:30.740 --> 00:32:33.450
So this is a similarity
between slides and

00:32:33.450 --> 00:32:36.890
blackboards, which is
you don't want to

00:32:36.890 --> 00:32:39.450
write everything down.

00:32:39.450 --> 00:32:43.540
Because if you write everything
down, then you say,

00:32:43.540 --> 00:32:46.330
well for example, did
I write every single

00:32:46.330 --> 00:32:47.260
thing I said here?

00:32:47.260 --> 00:32:50.410
No, because I want the main
ideas to come across.

00:32:50.410 --> 00:32:52.990
Every little detail that I say,
that should be either in

00:32:52.990 --> 00:32:55.130
the notes, or in some book.

00:32:55.130 --> 00:32:59.660
But the main point should be on
the blackboard at a level

00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:02.880
of detail that people
can absorb.

00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:03.940
It's the same thing
with slides.

00:33:03.940 --> 00:33:05.310
You don't want to put everything
on the slides.

00:33:05.310 --> 00:33:08.230
So, you can still write big,
if you just cut down

00:33:08.230 --> 00:33:10.740
how much you write.

00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:14.270
And generally, that is more
suited to what students need.

00:33:14.270 --> 00:33:19.360
Because, again, they are living
in the dirt of what is

00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:20.960
this, and what is this.

00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:22.830
And you want to try to
bring them up higher.

00:33:22.830 --> 00:33:25.090
So you don't want to spend a
whole bunch of time on all

00:33:25.090 --> 00:33:26.080
these little guys.

00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:28.630
You want to try to bring them
up higher, and put some

00:33:28.630 --> 00:33:31.910
high-level chunks onto the
little bits that they have.

00:33:31.910 --> 00:33:35.580
So use a big chalk, write,
large, just don't write

00:33:35.580 --> 00:33:36.110
everything.

00:33:36.110 --> 00:33:38.840
And try to fit a coherent
piece onto all the

00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:39.410
blackboards.

00:33:39.410 --> 00:33:40.860
It doesn't have to be
a whole lecture.

00:33:40.860 --> 00:33:43.220
Although Feynman, at
Caltech, when he

00:33:43.220 --> 00:33:44.350
gave the Feynman Lectures--

00:33:44.350 --> 00:33:46.220
well, what later became the
Feynman Lectures-- he did

00:33:46.220 --> 00:33:49.620
actually plan it so that he
would start at one corner, and

00:33:49.620 --> 00:33:53.480
he would end all the way here.

00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:57.020
And I find that's too hard to
do if you're also going to

00:33:57.020 --> 00:33:59.530
make the lecture at
all interactive.

00:33:59.530 --> 00:34:01.640
For example, if you're going to
have questions where you're

00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:03.960
going to have the students give
answers, and you're going

00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:04.960
to write down the answers.

00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:06.830
Well, you're not necessarily
going to keep all the answers

00:34:06.830 --> 00:34:08.690
for the rest of the class.

00:34:08.690 --> 00:34:11.630
So the goal of corner-to-corner,
I think, is

00:34:11.630 --> 00:34:12.570
a bit too strict.

00:34:12.570 --> 00:34:15.190
But the general idea is sound.

00:34:15.190 --> 00:34:18.620
Any questions about that before
we take a break, and

00:34:18.620 --> 00:34:22.409
then go onto slides,
and slide design?

00:34:22.409 --> 00:34:23.370
Yes.

00:34:23.370 --> 00:34:26.525
AUDIENCE: I just wanted to
comment that also, a lot of

00:34:26.525 --> 00:34:29.399
students, if there are slides,
and they're available online,

00:34:29.399 --> 00:34:32.280
they will just print them out,
and not come to lectures.

00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:34.699
PROFESSOR: That's true.

00:34:34.699 --> 00:34:37.250
A lot of students will just
print the lecture slides, and

00:34:37.250 --> 00:34:39.510
then just think they can thumb
through them, and understand

00:34:39.510 --> 00:34:40.290
the lecture.

00:34:40.290 --> 00:34:42.820
So that's partly--

00:34:42.820 --> 00:34:48.199
you could call it the
optimism of youth.

00:34:48.199 --> 00:34:51.560
That they don't realize how
much they're actually not

00:34:51.560 --> 00:34:53.810
seeing, because they didn't
actually come.

00:34:53.810 --> 00:34:56.770
They think if they just follow
each slide, they've understood

00:34:56.770 --> 00:34:57.110
everything.

00:34:57.110 --> 00:34:59.770
But there's no way to put
everything in a slide.

00:34:59.770 --> 00:35:03.160
If you packed a slide with
everything you said that was

00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:06.330
worth remembering, or that was
actually part of the structure

00:35:06.330 --> 00:35:08.020
of the argument, then it
would become not a

00:35:08.020 --> 00:35:10.510
slide, but a book chapter.

00:35:10.510 --> 00:35:11.870
And so, yeah.

00:35:11.870 --> 00:35:13.720
I think there is a reasonable
argument that if there's a

00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:16.080
book chapter--

00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:17.930
maybe they don't want to come to
lecture if all you're doing

00:35:17.930 --> 00:35:18.890
is reading the book chapter.

00:35:18.890 --> 00:35:20.705
But slide, and lecture,
are so different.

00:35:20.705 --> 00:35:24.030
It's sort of like, if you just
take a few photographs of the

00:35:24.030 --> 00:35:26.030
blackboard, could you
replace the lecture?

00:35:26.030 --> 00:35:28.520
No, but you're right, students
do think that.

00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:31.810
So actually I don't like giving
them handouts of the

00:35:31.810 --> 00:35:34.410
slides, if I do happen
to use slides.

00:35:34.410 --> 00:35:36.560
Because it's really not a
substitute for a lecture.

00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:39.590
It's an aid to the lecture, just
like the blackboard is an

00:35:39.590 --> 00:35:40.740
aide to the lecture.

00:35:40.740 --> 00:35:43.400
But what's important about the
lecture is, what are you

00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:45.040
having them do in the lecture?

00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:46.730
And that's the reason they
should come into lecture.

00:35:46.730 --> 00:35:48.590
Because in lecture, they're
actually struggling with some

00:35:48.590 --> 00:35:50.290
stuff, and you've structured
it so that they

00:35:50.290 --> 00:35:51.740
struggle, and learn.

00:35:51.740 --> 00:35:54.330
And somehow you have
to convince them

00:35:54.330 --> 00:35:55.750
that that's the value.

00:35:55.750 --> 00:35:59.070
And it's hard, because
of what you say.

00:35:59.070 --> 00:36:00.730
Other comments or questions?

00:36:00.730 --> 00:36:02.228
One second, in the back.

00:36:02.228 --> 00:36:03.722
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:03.722 --> 00:36:07.042
But at the same time, I've
probably taken at least half a

00:36:07.042 --> 00:36:09.210
dozen classes where every single
word that the lecturer

00:36:09.210 --> 00:36:12.150
spoke, was present
on the slide.

00:36:12.150 --> 00:36:16.183
And then it felt kind of
worthless going, because you

00:36:16.183 --> 00:36:20.378
show up, you pick up the slide
handouts, and you can read the

00:36:20.378 --> 00:36:22.314
slides during the lecture.

00:36:22.314 --> 00:36:24.129
You pay no attention to the
lecture, because he's not

00:36:24.129 --> 00:36:24.750
saying anything that
isn't there.

00:36:24.750 --> 00:36:25.760
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:27.780
So that's sort of the worst
of both worlds.

00:36:27.780 --> 00:36:30.820
So now, what they've done, is
they've taken the constraints

00:36:30.820 --> 00:36:32.000
of the slide format--

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:33.710
because there's only so many
words you can put on the

00:36:33.710 --> 00:36:35.990
slide, and make it even
at all readable--

00:36:35.990 --> 00:36:37.750
and often they don't make it
readable, and I'll show you an

00:36:37.750 --> 00:36:40.240
example when we come back.

00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:42.550
And so then they've torqued the
lecture to be basically

00:36:42.550 --> 00:36:44.320
reading out the slide.

00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:46.600
So now they messed up the
lecture, and the slide still

00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:49.580
isn't really a good
substitute.

00:36:49.580 --> 00:36:51.410
It's a huge problem.

00:36:51.410 --> 00:36:54.280
I think the answer to that, is
that if you're going to use

00:36:54.280 --> 00:36:56.790
slides, they're really an aide,
but the students really

00:36:56.790 --> 00:36:59.000
need to learn how to read
a book, or your notes.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:00.480
Or something that's actually
a coherent

00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:02.822
presentation of the material.

00:37:02.822 --> 00:37:03.300
Yes.

00:37:03.300 --> 00:37:05.790
AUDIENCE: So when you write
something on the board to

00:37:05.790 --> 00:37:09.533
respond to a comment, and it
[INAUDIBLE] some of your space

00:37:09.533 --> 00:37:12.620
that you could otherwise use to
plan for the usual stuff.

00:37:12.620 --> 00:37:15.150
So when do you erase
that comment?

00:37:17.670 --> 00:37:19.030
PROFESSOR: That's
a good question.

00:37:19.030 --> 00:37:21.650
So how temporary should
stuff be?

00:37:21.650 --> 00:37:26.920
One way to do it is to think
about the number of minutes

00:37:26.920 --> 00:37:29.280
each thing deserves.

00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:30.490
So that--

00:37:30.490 --> 00:37:33.560
I like things like that to be
on the board the whole time,

00:37:33.560 --> 00:37:35.290
if possible.

00:37:35.290 --> 00:37:38.100
And now it may be that, halfway
through, I might

00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:40.080
reclaim that board if I
don't have a choice.

00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:42.570
But I'd like that to be there
for a while, at least, because

00:37:42.570 --> 00:37:45.250
that's really the main reason
we're doing all this stuff.

00:37:45.250 --> 00:37:46.190
And what are we doing.

00:37:46.190 --> 00:37:48.650
So ideally, I'd put that on the
side blackboard, and just

00:37:48.650 --> 00:37:51.100
leave it there forever.

00:37:51.100 --> 00:37:53.410
Something like this, I would
like it to stay there the

00:37:53.410 --> 00:37:54.920
whole time, so we remember.

00:37:54.920 --> 00:37:56.840
So this, I would
mark as, "don't

00:37:56.840 --> 00:37:59.830
erase," if at all possible.

00:37:59.830 --> 00:38:06.520
So when I'm writing stuff
down, I would know, how

00:38:06.520 --> 00:38:07.840
perishable is the material?

00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:09.920
That's the word I'm
looking for.

00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:12.440
So suppose I ask people
a question,

00:38:12.440 --> 00:38:13.500
like the wood blocks.

00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:15.220
OK, what's the frequency
going to be?

00:38:15.220 --> 00:38:16.800
And we get a bunch of reasons.

00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:19.590
I think the reasons are
quite perishable.

00:38:19.590 --> 00:38:22.070
After we write them down, and
we talk about them, and then

00:38:22.070 --> 00:38:25.790
we reconcile everything, I'm
perfectly happy to erase all

00:38:25.790 --> 00:38:28.750
the reasons, and just
have the reconciled

00:38:28.750 --> 00:38:31.350
picture on the board.

00:38:31.350 --> 00:38:35.160
But while I'm reconciling,
I want them all visible.

00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:37.810
So then, what I would do, is I
would try to have all those

00:38:37.810 --> 00:38:40.480
reasons go, say, here.

00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:41.730
I might cover that
up temporarily.

00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:49.890
What I would do, is I would
write the reasons here, and

00:38:49.890 --> 00:38:54.990
then do the reconciliation
here.

00:38:54.990 --> 00:38:55.780
And then--

00:38:55.780 --> 00:38:58.280
so let's call this
Reconciliation--

00:38:58.280 --> 00:39:04.620
so this is actually the picture
that I would use for

00:39:04.620 --> 00:39:06.020
the wood blocks,
which is this.

00:39:06.020 --> 00:39:08.270
And I would draw a bunch of
arrows, and stuff, dot, dot,

00:39:08.270 --> 00:39:09.830
dots, and spring [? bogs ?]

00:39:09.830 --> 00:39:10.520
OK.

00:39:10.520 --> 00:39:15.200
And now, I need to reclaim this
board with perishable

00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:16.280
material on it.

00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:18.980
So now I reclaim the board.

00:39:18.980 --> 00:39:20.480
So this had reasons before.

00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:26.910
Lots of reasons.

00:39:26.910 --> 00:39:29.030
OK, and then, reclaim this.

00:39:29.030 --> 00:39:33.050
And I still have that
reconciliation up there, and I

00:39:33.050 --> 00:39:34.483
have this board back.

00:39:34.483 --> 00:39:37.490
AUDIENCE: So you think it is
a good idea to separate the

00:39:37.490 --> 00:39:41.745
perishable things on one board,
and then the more

00:39:41.745 --> 00:39:43.530
permanent things on
the other board?

00:39:43.530 --> 00:39:43.642
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:39:43.642 --> 00:39:44.610
I think it is a good idea.

00:39:44.610 --> 00:39:45.100
That's a good point.

00:39:45.100 --> 00:39:46.870
I hadn't thought of it that way,
but that is a good idea.

00:39:46.870 --> 00:39:50.080
Because that way you can reclaim
the entire board back,

00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:52.570
and then replace it with
more permanent things.

00:39:52.570 --> 00:39:54.700
Or, if something perishable
is going to go back

00:39:54.700 --> 00:39:56.100
on it, put it here.

00:39:56.100 --> 00:39:59.350
And then, when it's done, to
erase it, until a permanent

00:39:59.350 --> 00:40:00.100
thing goes on there.

00:40:00.100 --> 00:40:03.000
And then you move onto
the next board.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:04.920
So it does require some
board planning.

00:40:04.920 --> 00:40:07.710
But what you find, basically,
is the first time you teach

00:40:07.710 --> 00:40:09.820
the course, you wish you'd
planned it more

00:40:09.820 --> 00:40:10.840
in the first lecture.

00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:14.870
But then you start to be more
automatic about it.

00:40:14.870 --> 00:40:15.420
Yes.

00:40:15.420 --> 00:40:17.248
AUDIENCE: I have a comment
on the performance

00:40:17.248 --> 00:40:18.620
aspect of the board.

00:40:18.620 --> 00:40:21.392
So when you were writing these
equations, and then as you

00:40:21.392 --> 00:40:23.852
went back in the vector symbols,
and also when you're

00:40:23.852 --> 00:40:26.066
circling things, because if
you're doing it right, the

00:40:26.066 --> 00:40:26.804
students are engaged.

00:40:26.804 --> 00:40:30.260
Their focus is [INAUDIBLE]
chalk.

00:40:30.260 --> 00:40:31.446
PROFESSOR: That's
a good point.

00:40:31.446 --> 00:40:33.760
AUDIENCE: It's as much of an
interactive activity as they

00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:35.910
can with you writing
on the board.

00:40:35.910 --> 00:40:38.555
Whereas with a slide, certainly
[INAUDIBLE] a

00:40:38.555 --> 00:40:42.854
physical pointer, you might
circle something, but then

00:40:42.854 --> 00:40:43.846
there's nothing there.

00:40:43.846 --> 00:40:45.582
A laser pointer's even worse,
because you're not actually

00:40:45.582 --> 00:40:46.326
touching anything.

00:40:46.326 --> 00:40:49.671
Even if you have an animation
drawing, you're still

00:40:49.671 --> 00:40:51.084
separate from it.

00:40:51.084 --> 00:40:54.964
So I think that's a big
advantage of the board.

00:40:54.964 --> 00:40:58.454
If their attention is at your
chalk tip, then that's some

00:40:58.454 --> 00:41:03.540
degree of engagement
with that action.

00:41:03.540 --> 00:41:06.000
PROFESSOR: Yeah that's
a really good point.

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:11.720
So the point is that when I'm,
for example, circling this, it

00:41:11.720 --> 00:41:14.370
directs people's attention, and
then there's a permanent

00:41:14.370 --> 00:41:15.680
trace left.

00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:18.350
So you can, kind of,
do it on a slide.

00:41:18.350 --> 00:41:20.900
If you knew you were going to do
that ahead of time, you can

00:41:20.900 --> 00:41:24.870
make an animation that
goes, circle.

00:41:24.870 --> 00:41:26.900
So you can do that,
but it's hard.

00:41:26.900 --> 00:41:31.730
So one of the cures for that is
this tablet, a kind of PC.

00:41:31.730 --> 00:41:34.300
So you can actually write
on the tablet as you go.

00:41:34.300 --> 00:41:34.510
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:41:34.510 --> 00:41:37.756
But even so, the thing is that
you're still over there

00:41:37.756 --> 00:41:37.919
[INAUDIBLE].

00:41:37.919 --> 00:41:38.406
PROFESSOR: I know.

00:41:38.406 --> 00:41:41.340
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:41.340 --> 00:41:42.430
PROFESSOR: I think
that's true.

00:41:42.430 --> 00:41:44.210
That, actually, we are
together, doing

00:41:44.210 --> 00:41:45.860
this, on the object.

00:41:45.860 --> 00:41:48.071
AUDIENCE: Yeah that's exactly
what I was not saying very

00:41:48.071 --> 00:41:53.045
well earlier, was you can do all
this, what you're saying,

00:41:53.045 --> 00:41:54.340
on a slide, just as well.

00:41:54.340 --> 00:41:57.205
When I do [INAUDIBLE]
presentations, I do actually

00:41:57.205 --> 00:41:58.660
animate the circle.

00:41:58.660 --> 00:42:00.697
I find that that's the
most intuitive way

00:42:00.697 --> 00:42:02.055
for me to do something.

00:42:02.055 --> 00:42:04.480
But it's not the same as
actually drawing it yourself.

00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:05.450
It's not the same level
of activity.

00:42:05.450 --> 00:42:08.360
And obviously you kind of have
to use slides for [INAUDIBLE],

00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:10.310
but in a classroom you
don't have to.

00:42:10.310 --> 00:42:10.670
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:42:10.670 --> 00:42:12.830
OK, so that's what we'll talk
about when we come back-- the

00:42:12.830 --> 00:42:16.560
difference being technical
presentation, and teaching.

00:42:16.560 --> 00:42:20.120
And then we'll actually look at
an example of slides, and

00:42:20.120 --> 00:42:23.470
we'll critique them, and I'll
show you how to redraw them.

00:42:23.470 --> 00:42:26.100
OK so break for 10 minutes.

00:42:26.100 --> 00:42:29.090
We'll start at 10:18 sharp,
by that clock.

00:42:29.090 --> 00:42:32.250
So you can set your clocks
accordingly.

00:42:32.250 --> 00:42:36.360
And I will erase all this, and
put up a slide that we're

00:42:36.360 --> 00:42:37.410
going to critique.

00:42:37.410 --> 00:42:38.870
And then we'll talk
about technical

00:42:38.870 --> 00:42:40.080
presentations versus teaching.

00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:42.740
Because there's a lot of
misconceptions that come from

00:42:42.740 --> 00:42:44.100
technical presentations.

00:42:44.100 --> 00:42:45.310
And therefore, people
think we should

00:42:45.310 --> 00:42:46.580
use slides for teaching.

00:42:46.580 --> 00:42:49.510
OK, so see in 10 minutes, or
if people have questions

00:42:49.510 --> 00:42:50.760
during the break.

00:42:55.280 --> 00:43:03.950
OK, so our next task is to
figure out, if you are going

00:43:03.950 --> 00:43:07.650
to use slides, what
should you do.

00:43:07.650 --> 00:43:12.880
And related to that point is,
when are slides appropriate.

00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:16.880
People have the idea the slides
are always appropriate

00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:19.440
for teaching, because they
see them used all

00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:22.780
the time for seminars.

00:43:22.780 --> 00:43:25.280
So if you go, and give a talk
at a conference, you go to a

00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:26.380
conference, most--

00:43:26.380 --> 00:43:27.620
almost all the talks--

00:43:27.620 --> 00:43:32.100
or at the department seminars,
basically people now come with

00:43:32.100 --> 00:43:34.690
some form of slides.

00:43:34.690 --> 00:43:36.900
When I was an undergraduate, it
was sort of transitional--

00:43:36.900 --> 00:43:41.670
people came with overhead
projector foils.

00:43:41.670 --> 00:43:44.210
And it was sort of shifting,
from seminars used to be

00:43:44.210 --> 00:43:46.220
blackboard seminars, and then
they shifted to overhead

00:43:46.220 --> 00:43:48.860
projectors, at least
in physics.

00:43:48.860 --> 00:43:51.290
And now it's pretty much slides
all the way through.

00:43:51.290 --> 00:43:56.880
But there's a fundamental
difference between seminar

00:43:56.880 --> 00:43:59.420
presentation, and teaching.

00:43:59.420 --> 00:44:02.220
And seminar presentation--

00:44:02.220 --> 00:44:03.790
basically you're talking
to people

00:44:03.790 --> 00:44:05.240
who are sort of experts.

00:44:05.240 --> 00:44:08.320
They may not be experts in that
particular area you've

00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:09.250
understood.

00:44:09.250 --> 00:44:11.160
Probably not, otherwise they
would have invited one of them

00:44:11.160 --> 00:44:13.150
to talk, instead of you.

00:44:13.150 --> 00:44:16.700
So now, you're the expert
locally, on that local area.

00:44:16.700 --> 00:44:18.500
But in the broader area, you're
talking to basically

00:44:18.500 --> 00:44:19.740
people who are already
interested in, and are

00:44:19.740 --> 00:44:21.120
professionals in the field.

00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:23.985
And maybe some apprentices in
the field, who are going to

00:44:23.985 --> 00:44:26.320
soon be professionals, like
graduate students.

00:44:26.320 --> 00:44:30.550
So your goal is not to slowly,
necessarily, uncover one or

00:44:30.550 --> 00:44:34.430
two ideas, especially if it's
a 10-minute conference

00:44:34.430 --> 00:44:35.970
presentation.

00:44:35.970 --> 00:44:42.000
Your goal is something like,
here are the core, main

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:44.490
ideas-- one or two points-- and
here's something to show

00:44:44.490 --> 00:44:47.430
you that really interesting
stuff is going on.

00:44:47.430 --> 00:44:50.410
And you should pay more
attention to me is part of the

00:44:50.410 --> 00:44:51.920
goal of the seminar.

00:44:51.920 --> 00:44:54.290
Now that's very different
in teaching.

00:44:54.290 --> 00:44:57.570
In teaching, your goal really is
to kindle some new thoughts

00:44:57.570 --> 00:44:58.510
in the student.

00:44:58.510 --> 00:45:03.560
And who are very different
from a seminar audience.

00:45:03.560 --> 00:45:04.570
They are not professionals.

00:45:04.570 --> 00:45:07.910
Maybe they would like to
eventually be, but part of

00:45:07.910 --> 00:45:10.530
your job is to kindle that
interest so they would like to

00:45:10.530 --> 00:45:11.520
become professionals.

00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:14.500
So you have a very, very
different audience, and

00:45:14.500 --> 00:45:17.650
generally much different
time constraint.

00:45:17.650 --> 00:45:20.870
In a seminar, maybe it's 10
minutes, maybe 15 minutes.

00:45:20.870 --> 00:45:23.150
Rarely, once you start getting
well known, maybe you get

00:45:23.150 --> 00:45:24.830
invited to give a 50-minute
seminar.

00:45:24.830 --> 00:45:28.060
But, teaching, you generally
will have 50 minutes.

00:45:28.060 --> 00:45:32.030
So your time is different, your
audience is different.

00:45:32.030 --> 00:45:35.070
So just because slides are used
so much for seminars,

00:45:35.070 --> 00:45:37.130
does not mean they should be
used so much for teaching.

00:45:37.130 --> 00:45:39.990
You should really use them when
you don't really have a

00:45:39.990 --> 00:45:43.570
choice, and when it seems like
it's the optimal thing to do.

00:45:43.570 --> 00:45:46.690
So for example, art
history class.

00:45:46.690 --> 00:45:49.250
Now, an art history class, it
would be fantastic to go to

00:45:49.250 --> 00:45:51.600
Sienna, and look at all the
tapestries, and take the whole

00:45:51.600 --> 00:45:52.950
class with you.

00:45:52.950 --> 00:45:55.470
Now that's just too expensive.

00:45:55.470 --> 00:45:57.430
So, instead, you show slides.

00:45:57.430 --> 00:45:59.215
That's exactly why they're
called slides-- they

00:45:59.215 --> 00:46:01.350
originally were 35 millimeter
slides.

00:46:01.350 --> 00:46:03.610
35 millimeter?

00:46:03.610 --> 00:46:06.100
Yeah, 35 millimeter slides.

00:46:06.100 --> 00:46:08.290
So for something like that,
yes, slides are ideal.

00:46:08.290 --> 00:46:12.020
And drawing the tapestries of
Sienna on the blackboard is

00:46:12.020 --> 00:46:14.840
not even close to showing
the actual pictures.

00:46:14.840 --> 00:46:18.290
So, in that case, 100%
go with slides.

00:46:18.290 --> 00:46:20.820
Other cases generally go towards
blackboards, but there

00:46:20.820 --> 00:46:22.770
are cases where, for example,
there are no blackboards in

00:46:22.770 --> 00:46:24.770
the room, and you have
to teach with slides.

00:46:24.770 --> 00:46:25.950
There's no whiteboard, either.

00:46:25.950 --> 00:46:28.730
Whiteboards are not as good as
blackboards, but they're a

00:46:28.730 --> 00:46:29.690
reasonable substitute.

00:46:29.690 --> 00:46:32.370
But there's neither, and
it's just slides.

00:46:32.370 --> 00:46:33.615
Or, yes--

00:46:33.615 --> 00:46:34.980
AUDIENCE: Why aren't whiteboards
as good as

00:46:34.980 --> 00:46:35.890
blackboards?

00:46:35.890 --> 00:46:42.160
PROFESSOR: I find the markers
always dry out, whereas chalk

00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:43.480
always works.

00:46:43.480 --> 00:46:46.040
So blackboard markers never
quite work as well.

00:46:46.040 --> 00:46:50.200
And the other problem, just
me personally, is that I'm

00:46:50.200 --> 00:46:52.130
sensitive to the chemicals
in them.

00:46:52.130 --> 00:46:54.430
So I eventually just get
a bit dizzy using them.

00:46:57.880 --> 00:46:59.710
So I don't like him
for that reason.

00:46:59.710 --> 00:47:00.840
And there's quite
a few people.

00:47:00.840 --> 00:47:02.920
I'm sort of the canary, so I'm
more sensitive, maybe, than

00:47:02.920 --> 00:47:04.900
many people, because I have
lots of allergies.

00:47:04.900 --> 00:47:07.370
But I think lots of people are
bit sensitive to them.

00:47:07.370 --> 00:47:08.670
But, generally, I find
the markers just

00:47:08.670 --> 00:47:09.470
don't work as well.

00:47:09.470 --> 00:47:14.550
And, also, there's very rare
room has lots of whiteboards.

00:47:14.550 --> 00:47:17.320
Whereas many, many, classrooms
have this many blackboards.

00:47:17.320 --> 00:47:20.550
When they replace them with
whiteboards, usually it'll be

00:47:20.550 --> 00:47:21.900
one whiteboard.

00:47:21.900 --> 00:47:25.330
So then you're back to many of
the disadvantages of slides,

00:47:25.330 --> 00:47:28.780
which is that you can't get
a big field of view.

00:47:28.780 --> 00:47:31.910
But now let's say you are
going to use slides.

00:47:31.910 --> 00:47:33.600
How do we make good slides?

00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:36.320
Well, one way to figure out what
constitutes good slides,

00:47:36.320 --> 00:47:38.770
is to look at what constitutes
bad slides.

00:47:38.770 --> 00:47:43.020
So this, here, is
a horrid slide.

00:47:43.020 --> 00:47:44.620
So what we're going to do is,
I'm going to show you how to

00:47:44.620 --> 00:47:45.470
re-write the slide.

00:47:45.470 --> 00:47:47.180
But first, let's figure out what
are some of the problems

00:47:47.180 --> 00:47:47.920
with this slide.

00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:52.600
So, take a couple minutes
with your neighbors.

00:47:52.600 --> 00:47:54.070
You can all see the slide.

00:47:54.070 --> 00:47:57.970
What are the things that just
don't work about it?

00:47:57.970 --> 00:47:59.430
And there's many.

00:47:59.430 --> 00:48:02.600
It's a very competitive field.

00:48:02.600 --> 00:48:06.180
And I'll write some stuff
down on here.

00:48:06.180 --> 00:48:09.540
By the way, one thing is
that the JIT, that I

00:48:09.540 --> 00:48:11.460
just actually shortened.

00:48:11.460 --> 00:48:14.040
It actually was, "Just
in Time Learning".

00:48:14.040 --> 00:48:16.630
I've just shortened it to
improve the typesetting,

00:48:16.630 --> 00:48:18.500
assuming that the audience
knows what it means.

00:48:18.500 --> 00:48:20.900
So the original slide didn't
have that problem.

00:48:25.240 --> 00:48:30.340
So I see you found
lots of trouble.

00:48:30.340 --> 00:48:34.060
Give me one thing
that's wrong.

00:48:34.060 --> 00:48:34.860
Adrian.

00:48:34.860 --> 00:48:36.410
AUDIENCE: There's no message.

00:48:36.410 --> 00:48:37.660
PROFESSOR: What do you
mean by message?

00:48:39.860 --> 00:48:44.310
AUDIENCE: What is the person
trying to tell you here.

00:48:44.310 --> 00:48:48.090
You have to infer what the
person is trying to tell you

00:48:48.090 --> 00:48:50.222
by analysing it yourself.

00:48:55.140 --> 00:48:56.530
PROFESSOR: OK, no message.

00:48:56.530 --> 00:48:59.650
So, the reader, the viewer,
the student--

00:48:59.650 --> 00:49:02.520
this was actually used in a
class, never mind where, but

00:49:02.520 --> 00:49:04.770
it's not here.

00:49:04.770 --> 00:49:09.310
Yeah, what is the teacher
trying to communicate?

00:49:09.310 --> 00:49:12.740
So Jean-Luc Doumont, if you
saw him during IAP--

00:49:12.740 --> 00:49:17.630
he has a great way of talking
about what's a message, versus

00:49:17.630 --> 00:49:18.870
what's information.

00:49:18.870 --> 00:49:20.120
So the message--

00:49:30.220 --> 00:49:33.360
so information, that's
what that slide has.

00:49:33.360 --> 00:49:34.470
It has lots of information.

00:49:34.470 --> 00:49:47.920
That's the "what." Message
is the "so what."

00:49:47.920 --> 00:49:49.530
His native language
is not English.

00:49:49.530 --> 00:49:51.670
I wish I could come up
with things like

00:49:51.670 --> 00:49:55.000
that in other languages.

00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:57.970
I think it's fantastic, because
there's lots of

00:49:57.970 --> 00:50:03.280
"what." Well, 12% said Just
in Time Learning--

00:50:03.280 --> 00:50:05.220
JIT Learning-- was a bad idea.

00:50:05.220 --> 00:50:08.340
But your question is, so what?

00:50:08.340 --> 00:50:10.490
And there's no answer
to that question.

00:50:10.490 --> 00:50:11.740
So there's no message.

00:50:14.474 --> 00:50:15.472
Yes.

00:50:15.472 --> 00:50:18.845
AUDIENCE: So a counterpoint
to that would be, this is

00:50:18.845 --> 00:50:21.168
documentation, this
isn't propaganda.

00:50:21.168 --> 00:50:21.655
Right?

00:50:21.655 --> 00:50:25.875
You don't want to say, this is
what you should all think

00:50:25.875 --> 00:50:28.716
about this data, instead of,
look at the data yourself, and

00:50:28.716 --> 00:50:29.934
make your own conclusion.

00:50:29.934 --> 00:50:31.719
Presenting the data in an
accessible manner is a

00:50:31.719 --> 00:50:32.369
different issue.

00:50:32.369 --> 00:50:35.800
But I don't know if I agree
with this, "so what" idea.

00:50:35.800 --> 00:50:37.730
PROFESSOR: And some of that is
that, yeah, definitely in a

00:50:37.730 --> 00:50:41.570
seminar, you lean much more
towards the "so what." And you

00:50:41.570 --> 00:50:44.470
would put in the "so what,"
really first.

00:50:44.470 --> 00:50:47.990
And in teaching, maybe you start
with the "what," and

00:50:47.990 --> 00:50:52.140
then you lead to the "so what."
So, for example, the

00:50:52.140 --> 00:50:53.310
wood blocks.

00:50:53.310 --> 00:50:56.060
Here's the "what--" what do you
think is going to happen?

00:50:56.060 --> 00:50:58.710
And I haven't said,
"so what," really.

00:50:58.710 --> 00:51:02.090
And then we talk about a whole
bunch of ways of analyzing it,

00:51:02.090 --> 00:51:03.880
and then we finally lead
up to the "so what.".

00:51:03.880 --> 00:51:07.350
But at some point, you
do want a "so what."

00:51:07.350 --> 00:51:10.050
So, yeah, without seeing the
entire lecture, it's hard to

00:51:10.050 --> 00:51:13.120
know if they ever gave a "so
what." But I can tell you that

00:51:13.120 --> 00:51:16.320
the succeeding slides just
went on to other topics.

00:51:16.320 --> 00:51:18.140
So it wasn't that they
were using that

00:51:18.140 --> 00:51:19.830
to develop the point--

00:51:19.830 --> 00:51:22.330
what do you think about Just
in Time Learning, or how

00:51:22.330 --> 00:51:24.090
should we analyze Just
in Time Learning.

00:51:24.090 --> 00:51:25.820
They just moved on.

00:51:25.820 --> 00:51:26.588
Yes.

00:51:26.588 --> 00:51:30.340
AUDIENCE: Going back to your art
history example as a good

00:51:30.340 --> 00:51:33.264
use of slides, that doesn't have
anything in it that gives

00:51:33.264 --> 00:51:36.756
you "so what." It gives the
presentation of information,

00:51:36.756 --> 00:51:39.612
and then the discussion of
it is what gives that.

00:51:39.612 --> 00:51:41.760
So I don't necessarily think
there's something inherently

00:51:41.760 --> 00:51:46.410
wrong with giving information
on a slide, and having not

00:51:46.410 --> 00:51:48.785
answered the discussion
in the slide.

00:51:51.650 --> 00:51:53.160
PROFESSOR: It's not inherently
wrong, and

00:51:53.160 --> 00:51:54.030
that's a good point.

00:51:54.030 --> 00:51:56.070
So the art history one,
it's sort of a

00:51:56.070 --> 00:51:58.400
different use of the slide.

00:51:58.400 --> 00:52:01.570
So there, it's really like
you're bringing in a prop.

00:52:01.570 --> 00:52:05.000
So the cones, these pyramids
themselves, didn't have a "so

00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:08.090
what." They only got a "so
what" as we used them.

00:52:08.090 --> 00:52:11.200
So it's the same way with
the art history slide.

00:52:11.200 --> 00:52:14.512
It would get its "so what" in
how you discussed the slide.

00:52:14.512 --> 00:52:19.810
But here, the slide
is really the

00:52:19.810 --> 00:52:21.400
alternative to the lecture--

00:52:21.400 --> 00:52:22.650
to the blackboard.

00:52:26.020 --> 00:52:30.600
If you've gone to slide talks,
or slide teaching, which

00:52:30.600 --> 00:52:31.520
aren't art history.

00:52:31.520 --> 00:52:34.060
I think art history is really
a separate example.

00:52:34.060 --> 00:52:37.300
It's, I'm telling you stuff,
I'm telling you stuff, I'm

00:52:37.300 --> 00:52:39.450
just telling you in a way
that you don't really

00:52:39.450 --> 00:52:41.090
know what I'm telling.

00:52:41.090 --> 00:52:43.940
Like, I may be telling it to
you verbally, but the slide

00:52:43.940 --> 00:52:45.190
doesn't match what
I'm telling you.

00:52:47.680 --> 00:52:48.490
Sorry, you're next.

00:52:48.490 --> 00:52:50.202
Go ahead first.

00:52:50.202 --> 00:52:52.632
AUDIENCE: You may have already
said this, but is this slide

00:52:52.632 --> 00:52:54.904
supposed to be for the students,
or is this for a

00:52:54.904 --> 00:52:55.770
faculty meeting?

00:52:55.770 --> 00:52:58.935
PROFESSOR: No, this was
for a course about--

00:52:58.935 --> 00:53:00.020
what was the course about?

00:53:00.020 --> 00:53:03.806
It was a computer science
course somewhere.

00:53:06.970 --> 00:53:09.200
Maybe it was a discussion
of a--

00:53:09.200 --> 00:53:11.730
no, it was a computer science
course, or a teaching course.

00:53:11.730 --> 00:53:13.710
I forget exactly what course
it was, but it was from a

00:53:13.710 --> 00:53:14.920
particular course.

00:53:14.920 --> 00:53:18.054
So it's a slide used
in teaching.

00:53:18.054 --> 00:53:19.978
Yes.

00:53:19.978 --> 00:53:21.661
AUDIENCE: That partially
answers what I

00:53:21.661 --> 00:53:23.345
was going to say.

00:53:23.345 --> 00:53:26.890
This material doesn't belong in
the lecture in any course,

00:53:26.890 --> 00:53:29.480
unless it's a course
on teaching.

00:53:29.480 --> 00:53:32.515
The surveys are filled out, so
they benefitted the lecturer

00:53:32.515 --> 00:53:34.455
so that they know what
to do when planning

00:53:34.455 --> 00:53:35.425
and running the course.

00:53:35.425 --> 00:53:38.820
The students don't need to know
what the results are.

00:53:38.820 --> 00:53:42.020
PROFESSOR: I think it wasn't for
the course itself, it was

00:53:42.020 --> 00:53:46.380
for the students in a teaching
course, is what I

00:53:46.380 --> 00:53:47.630
think it was for.

00:53:49.770 --> 00:53:54.060
And either way, whether it's
for a seminar, or for a

00:53:54.060 --> 00:53:56.090
teaching course, it has the
same problem, which is you

00:53:56.090 --> 00:53:57.530
don't even know what
to think about it.

00:53:57.530 --> 00:53:59.830
You just have a lot of data.

00:53:59.830 --> 00:54:01.310
And there's no integration.

00:54:01.310 --> 00:54:05.345
OK, so that's the no message--

00:54:05.345 --> 00:54:06.190
the "what," versus "so what."

00:54:06.190 --> 00:54:07.270
What else is wrong?

00:54:07.270 --> 00:54:09.063
Yeah, Wendy?

00:54:09.063 --> 00:54:11.518
AUDIENCE: The data is just
terribly organized.

00:54:11.518 --> 00:54:13.482
[INAUDIBLE]

00:54:13.482 --> 00:54:18.392
One thing is that there's
bullets under bullets.

00:54:18.392 --> 00:54:23.793
By the time I get to
[INAUDIBLE], I'd rather skip,

00:54:23.793 --> 00:54:27.721
I've forgotten [INAUDIBLE], I
don't remember what we were

00:54:27.721 --> 00:54:29.700
talking about.

00:54:29.700 --> 00:54:31.900
PROFESSOR: Right, so the
organization is ghastly.

00:54:31.900 --> 00:54:35.633
AUDIENCE: And another good
comment, which is that the

00:54:35.633 --> 00:54:39.692
numbers of the percentages are
not organized in any way.

00:54:39.692 --> 00:54:41.153
They're not going from
highest to lowest,

00:54:41.153 --> 00:54:42.614
or lowest to highest.

00:54:42.614 --> 00:54:47.880
So you've seen, maybe 52, you're
like, I assume this is

00:54:47.880 --> 00:54:49.437
going in descending
order, and then

00:54:49.437 --> 00:54:51.390
things get flipped around.

00:54:51.390 --> 00:54:51.940
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:54:51.940 --> 00:54:54.060
So the percentages are
kind of random.

00:54:54.060 --> 00:54:57.740
It's sort of like the "what." To
organize it towards the "so

00:54:57.740 --> 00:54:59.760
what," you would put
some theme in it.

00:54:59.760 --> 00:55:02.750
But there isn't any, or
none that's obvious.

00:55:02.750 --> 00:55:05.600
And the typesetting, yes, is
related to the organization.

00:55:05.600 --> 00:55:06.440
The typesetting is a bit off.

00:55:06.440 --> 00:55:07.640
Yeah.

00:55:07.640 --> 00:55:10.307
AUDIENCE: So related to that,
[INAUDIBLE] the numbers and

00:55:10.307 --> 00:55:14.430
the questions are given
completely equal footing,

00:55:14.430 --> 00:55:17.825
because the numbers are
organized, [INAUDIBLE].

00:55:17.825 --> 00:55:20.706
And so the numbers just follow
better to worse.

00:55:24.087 --> 00:55:26.502
I'm sorry, the answers to the
questions are organized from

00:55:26.502 --> 00:55:27.468
better to worse.

00:55:27.468 --> 00:55:28.440
[INAUDIBLE]

00:55:28.440 --> 00:55:29.720
PROFESSOR: OK, so then
it comes out.

00:55:29.720 --> 00:55:29.950
OK.

00:55:29.950 --> 00:55:32.520
AUDIENCE: And then it comes
out, but that's not

00:55:32.520 --> 00:55:33.770
[INAUDIBLE].

00:55:37.230 --> 00:55:39.400
PROFESSOR: So the Likert
scale isn't obvious.

00:55:43.350 --> 00:55:45.860
The Likert scale is the
better-to-worse scale of how

00:55:45.860 --> 00:55:47.380
much you agree with
this statement.

00:55:47.380 --> 00:55:48.120
Right.

00:55:48.120 --> 00:55:50.360
So you're saying, also, the
answers have equal prominence

00:55:50.360 --> 00:55:51.587
to the questions.

00:55:51.587 --> 00:55:53.455
AUDIENCE: Equal prominence
to the percentages.

00:55:53.455 --> 00:55:56.730
You have no clue what's
organizing the information.

00:55:56.730 --> 00:55:58.680
PROFESSOR: Right OK.

00:55:58.680 --> 00:56:07.500
So the emphasis is random.

00:56:07.500 --> 00:56:08.482
Yes.

00:56:08.482 --> 00:56:12.410
AUDIENCE: So [INAUDIBLE]

00:56:12.410 --> 00:56:14.865
so she suggested [INAUDIBLE]

00:56:14.865 --> 00:56:16.115
or [INAUDIBLE].

00:56:24.220 --> 00:56:29.650
PROFESSOR: OK, so
it's not visual.

00:56:29.650 --> 00:56:32.040
A pie chart, or a histogram,
or something would help you

00:56:32.040 --> 00:56:33.430
see much more.

00:56:33.430 --> 00:56:36.910
So that's one of our principles,
right, that your

00:56:36.910 --> 00:56:40.130
perceptual system is so much
smarter than your symbolic

00:56:40.130 --> 00:56:42.010
processing system.

00:56:42.010 --> 00:56:44.620
So you're actually slowing
everyone down, and making them

00:56:44.620 --> 00:56:47.890
much dumber, by forcing them
to try to extract--

00:56:47.890 --> 00:56:50.390
basically build a mental
picture which you

00:56:50.390 --> 00:56:52.030
could build for them.

00:56:52.030 --> 00:56:53.503
Yes.

00:56:53.503 --> 00:56:56.290
AUDIENCE: I'd say there's
too much.

00:56:56.290 --> 00:56:57.540
PROFESSOR: Too much.

00:56:59.990 --> 00:57:03.360
So what do you think
is too much?

00:57:03.360 --> 00:57:07.443
AUDIENCE: All at once, you're
getting lots of text, and it's

00:57:07.443 --> 00:57:09.120
all these different things.

00:57:09.120 --> 00:57:10.080
Too much [? given ?].

00:57:10.080 --> 00:57:11.920
PROFESSOR: Yeah, it's
too many chunks.

00:57:11.920 --> 00:57:13.295
It just overloads you.

00:57:13.295 --> 00:57:17.070
You don't relate it to
the lack of messages.

00:57:17.070 --> 00:57:18.690
If there are messages
in there, there

00:57:18.690 --> 00:57:19.690
are too many messages.

00:57:19.690 --> 00:57:22.360
You don't know what's important,
and what to pay

00:57:22.360 --> 00:57:24.960
attention to.

00:57:24.960 --> 00:57:25.980
Other problems?

00:57:25.980 --> 00:57:26.450
Yes.

00:57:26.450 --> 00:57:28.500
AUDIENCE: Format switches
midstream.

00:57:28.500 --> 00:57:29.470
PROFESSOR: Where?

00:57:29.470 --> 00:57:31.300
AUDIENCE: At the bottom,
the last question.

00:57:31.300 --> 00:57:32.020
PROFESSOR: Oh yeah.

00:57:32.020 --> 00:57:33.300
You're right.

00:57:33.300 --> 00:57:36.814
OK So the format.

00:57:36.814 --> 00:57:38.064
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:57:39.950 --> 00:57:40.250
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:57:40.250 --> 00:57:41.980
It's sort of related
to too much.

00:57:41.980 --> 00:57:44.350
Right, I tried to put too much
on my slide, and I really

00:57:44.350 --> 00:57:45.600
tried, really hard.

00:57:52.170 --> 00:57:54.850
So the format changes at the
end, right, so they could fit

00:57:54.850 --> 00:57:57.691
everything onto one slide.

00:57:57.691 --> 00:57:58.188
Yes.

00:57:58.188 --> 00:58:03.655
AUDIENCE: Extraneous use of
bullets, colons, [INAUDIBLE].

00:58:03.655 --> 00:58:04.905
Not helping.

00:58:07.640 --> 00:58:09.520
PROFESSOR: So a random use
of colons and bullets.

00:58:14.920 --> 00:58:19.000
And it's not clear how
those actually help.

00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:19.500
Other problems.

00:58:19.500 --> 00:58:19.880
Yeah.

00:58:19.880 --> 00:58:21.680
AUDIENCE: Is that all bold?

00:58:21.680 --> 00:58:22.890
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:58:22.890 --> 00:58:24.180
I think it is all bold.

00:58:24.180 --> 00:58:27.500
So everything's equally
emphasized.

00:58:27.500 --> 00:58:28.750
So all bold.

00:58:33.170 --> 00:58:36.610
So again, it's presenting all
the information, right?

00:58:36.610 --> 00:58:39.090
It's just you don't know what's
important-- what's the

00:58:39.090 --> 00:58:41.768
"so what." Yep.

00:58:41.768 --> 00:58:45.177
AUDIENCE: The numbers are very
far away from the text, so by

00:58:45.177 --> 00:58:47.125
the time you get over there,
you don't know.

00:58:54.440 --> 00:58:57.000
PROFESSOR: Right, it's sort of
like a table of contents.

00:58:57.000 --> 00:58:58.950
And that's OK, for a
table of contents.

00:58:58.950 --> 00:59:01.470
It's not ideal, but there are
ways of doing table of

00:59:01.470 --> 00:59:02.390
contents that don't
have that problem.

00:59:02.390 --> 00:59:04.140
For a table of contents
it's OK.

00:59:04.140 --> 00:59:07.010
You don't need to sort of
get the entire table

00:59:07.010 --> 00:59:08.290
at a glance, right?

00:59:08.290 --> 00:59:10.430
You just want to know where
chapter five begins, and you

00:59:10.430 --> 00:59:12.450
just scan across, and
you go there.

00:59:12.450 --> 00:59:14.530
Whereas here, you can't
match the things.

00:59:14.530 --> 00:59:16.440
You want to try to match it all
together, and you can't,

00:59:16.440 --> 00:59:20.990
because the numbers are so
far away from the text.

00:59:20.990 --> 00:59:23.880
AUDIENCE: I don't know
what PI means.

00:59:23.880 --> 00:59:25.120
PROFESSOR: Sorry, that
was my fault, too.

00:59:25.120 --> 00:59:26.210
I just tried to shift it.

00:59:26.210 --> 00:59:28.430
Peer instruction.

00:59:28.430 --> 00:59:31.090
Yeah, you're right, so there's
a lot of use of acronyms.

00:59:35.980 --> 00:59:40.880
Yeah, so the JIT, and the PI
were my contributions to it.

00:59:40.880 --> 00:59:42.100
So maybe I made it a
little bit worse.

00:59:42.100 --> 00:59:42.340
Yeah.

00:59:42.340 --> 00:59:44.288
AUDIENCE: So how would you do
this on the blackboard,

00:59:44.288 --> 00:59:47.620
instead, if you had a chance?

00:59:47.620 --> 00:59:49.000
PROFESSOR: So this one,
actually, if I were going to

00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:52.240
present this, I would either
draw the thing I'm about to

00:59:52.240 --> 00:59:55.850
show you, or I would
use a slide for it.

00:59:55.850 --> 00:59:56.470
Either way.

00:59:56.470 --> 00:59:59.470
AUDIENCE: A slide with what?

00:59:59.470 --> 01:00:02.200
PROFESSOR: I'll show you what
the redrawn slide is.

01:00:02.200 --> 01:00:04.660
OK, so now let's redraw
the slide.

01:00:04.660 --> 01:00:06.225
So I think the slide
that I redrew--

01:00:06.225 --> 01:00:07.460
I'll show it to you--

01:00:07.460 --> 01:00:09.340
basically answers most
of these objections,

01:00:09.340 --> 01:00:10.160
though maybe not all.

01:00:10.160 --> 01:00:12.320
I think most of them.

01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:15.640
So what I'm going to show you
is what Michael Alley calls

01:00:15.640 --> 01:00:20.790
the Assertion-Evidence
design for slides.

01:00:20.790 --> 01:00:22.505
So Michael Alley, I'll
write his name down.

01:00:36.680 --> 01:00:40.640
So Michael Alley, and his book
is called The Craft of

01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:45.038
Scientific Presentation,
I think.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:03.970
And this is to get around
many of these problems.

01:01:03.970 --> 01:01:06.700
So the idea is, first of all,
so related to what Jean-luc

01:01:06.700 --> 01:01:11.890
says, talking about messages
versus information, each slide

01:01:11.890 --> 01:01:13.720
should have one message--

01:01:13.720 --> 01:01:14.800
one assertion.

01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:18.360
So that's the assertion
part of the slide.

01:01:18.360 --> 01:01:22.210
And the body of the slide
is the evidence.

01:01:22.210 --> 01:01:25.610
And it should ideally be visual
evidence, because of

01:01:25.610 --> 01:01:28.760
all the reasons we talked about
for visual evidence.

01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:31.750
So here is an example of that.

01:01:31.750 --> 01:01:33.000
There.

01:01:40.860 --> 01:01:42.350
Is this the entire slide?

01:01:42.350 --> 01:01:43.430
No.

01:01:43.430 --> 01:01:47.570
This is just one, basically,
third of it.

01:01:47.570 --> 01:01:51.000
But you can redraw the rest of
the slide, with two more

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.380
slides, this way.

01:01:53.380 --> 01:01:56.070
So this is one slide,
with one message--

01:01:56.070 --> 01:01:59.360
most students like in-class
concept tests.

01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:01.860
If that's the point you're
trying to make.

01:02:01.860 --> 01:02:03.450
The problem is, it's
hard to redraw

01:02:03.450 --> 01:02:05.280
slides with no messages.

01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:07.300
Because you don't actually know
what the message was, so

01:02:07.300 --> 01:02:09.290
you have to sort of infer it.

01:02:09.290 --> 01:02:12.680
But hopefully the author could
actually infer it, and redraw

01:02:12.680 --> 01:02:14.050
it themself.

01:02:14.050 --> 01:02:16.320
So here you have to
play author, and

01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:17.410
I guessed the message--

01:02:17.410 --> 01:02:19.500
most students like in-class
concept tests.

01:02:22.920 --> 01:02:25.670
The presentation is here,
with a pie chart.

01:02:25.670 --> 01:02:31.130
And you notice all of the tags,
the "I like them", the

01:02:31.130 --> 01:02:33.750
"please skip them," "I dislike
them." They're all right next

01:02:33.750 --> 01:02:35.200
to their percentages.

01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:38.910
And then, what's
color used for?

01:02:38.910 --> 01:02:43.810
There, color is used to
emphasize the like.

01:02:43.810 --> 01:02:46.430
So the green, and the light
green, are both

01:02:46.430 --> 01:02:48.770
categories of like.

01:02:48.770 --> 01:02:51.330
As asserted by the author.

01:02:51.330 --> 01:02:55.640
I mean, you could say, well, no
"enjoy and learn from them"

01:02:55.640 --> 01:02:59.480
is the only category that
matters, "like" isn't strong

01:02:59.480 --> 01:03:01.630
enough, or really you shouldn't
lump them together.

01:03:01.630 --> 01:03:02.630
You can have those debates.

01:03:02.630 --> 01:03:04.270
But what the author--

01:03:04.270 --> 01:03:06.790
the teacher-- is trying
to say, is that most

01:03:06.790 --> 01:03:07.980
students like them.

01:03:07.980 --> 01:03:10.390
And you can see it just at a
glance, because most of the

01:03:10.390 --> 01:03:11.640
pie chart is colored in.

01:03:14.570 --> 01:03:18.860
So this solves most
of the problems.

01:03:18.860 --> 01:03:24.045
First of all, you don't have the
ghastly typesetting that

01:03:24.045 --> 01:03:25.580
you have here.

01:03:25.580 --> 01:03:27.490
The typesetting here is just
horrendous, this is sort of

01:03:27.490 --> 01:03:29.780
typical PowerPoint
typesetting.

01:03:29.780 --> 01:03:32.160
The alignment is nonexistent.

01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:35.140
There's random alignment
lines everywhere.

01:03:35.140 --> 01:03:38.560
If you look, for example, at
the way top, the yellow bar

01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:40.020
doesn't align with
anything else.

01:03:40.020 --> 01:03:42.100
The left edge of
it just doesn't

01:03:42.100 --> 01:03:43.500
align with the bullets.

01:03:43.500 --> 01:03:46.590
The open bullets are
just random.

01:03:46.590 --> 01:03:49.210
It's just a big mess,
as you pointed out.

01:03:49.210 --> 01:03:52.630
So here, just get
rid of all that.

01:03:52.630 --> 01:03:54.910
And you can do this
with any program.

01:03:54.910 --> 01:03:57.160
You can make your figure
however you want.

01:03:57.160 --> 01:04:00.240
You can put one assertion
at the top.

01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:03.430
So now assertion, another
synonym for that is "sentence

01:04:03.430 --> 01:04:06.730
headlines." So you want
your title of your

01:04:06.730 --> 01:04:08.485
slide to be a sentence.

01:04:08.485 --> 01:04:10.630
If you're not writing a
sentence, you're probably

01:04:10.630 --> 01:04:11.800
writing a topic.

01:04:11.800 --> 01:04:13.710
You're just mentioning
something-- you're giving them

01:04:13.710 --> 01:04:16.900
"what." To give "so what," you
really need a sentence.

01:04:16.900 --> 01:04:20.080
So fit a sentence of one or
two lines there, and then,

01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:22.996
give visual evidence.

01:04:22.996 --> 01:04:23.984
Yes.

01:04:23.984 --> 01:04:26.701
AUDIENCE: To sort of play
devil's advocate, I mean, I

01:04:26.701 --> 01:04:30.587
agree [INAUDIBLE], but the
advantage of having all the

01:04:30.587 --> 01:04:32.824
information on one slide is
you can see the different

01:04:32.824 --> 01:04:35.970
things, and see the different
conclusions.

01:04:35.970 --> 01:04:37.450
PROFESSOR: If you could
actually see them.

01:04:37.450 --> 01:04:39.080
The problem is, you can't
actually see all the

01:04:39.080 --> 01:04:39.960
conclusions.

01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:43.970
I agree it's nice to see all
the conclusions at once.

01:04:43.970 --> 01:04:46.910
So to do that, what I would
do is, I would make--

01:04:46.910 --> 01:04:49.820
I think there are really
three messages here--

01:04:49.820 --> 01:04:51.380
one for each of the questions.

01:04:51.380 --> 01:04:55.120
So I made a slide for the first
one, which is about the

01:04:55.120 --> 01:04:56.280
concept test.

01:04:56.280 --> 01:04:59.500
You'd make another slide for
the Just in Time learning,

01:04:59.500 --> 01:05:02.260
another one for, do lectures
cover too much material.

01:05:02.260 --> 01:05:03.220
So now you have three.

01:05:03.220 --> 01:05:08.060
And now, basically you want an
overall message of, overall

01:05:08.060 --> 01:05:10.730
these instructional changes
were well liked.

01:05:10.730 --> 01:05:13.130
Then you could have one summary
slide, which just

01:05:13.130 --> 01:05:14.850
lists those three points.

01:05:14.850 --> 01:05:17.410
And with maybe three small pie
charts, to remind people of

01:05:17.410 --> 01:05:19.540
each pie chart, to fit
it all together.

01:05:19.540 --> 01:05:23.210
But to try to pull it out of
that, the people won't

01:05:23.210 --> 01:05:25.800
actually get the
three messages.

01:05:25.800 --> 01:05:28.050
So you have to guide
them towards it.

01:05:28.050 --> 01:05:30.310
Hopefully you can use this for
your seminars as well, not

01:05:30.310 --> 01:05:32.020
just for your teaching.

01:05:32.020 --> 01:05:34.310
This works for teaching,
as well seminars.

01:05:34.310 --> 01:05:36.800
Now, how would you actually put
this into practice, in a

01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:37.860
teaching example?

01:05:37.860 --> 01:05:40.970
So that's what comes up next.

01:05:40.970 --> 01:05:44.500
I'll show you a mathematical
example, which you could do on

01:05:44.500 --> 01:05:48.850
the blackboard, or I sort of
optimized it so you could do

01:05:48.850 --> 01:05:50.250
it on slides too.

01:05:50.250 --> 01:05:52.640
And we can see how that goes.

01:05:52.640 --> 01:05:56.040
OK, so here is just the
comparison, side by side, of

01:05:56.040 --> 01:05:57.770
the two slides.

01:05:57.770 --> 01:05:58.840
Just at a glance.

01:05:58.840 --> 01:06:00.520
I don't actually mean for people
to be able to read the

01:06:00.520 --> 01:06:04.140
words, just to see that one has
enough information that

01:06:04.140 --> 01:06:07.160
you can get a point, but doesn't
overload you, and the

01:06:07.160 --> 01:06:09.770
other is just a rat's nest.

01:06:09.770 --> 01:06:11.950
OK, so then the mathematical
example--

01:06:11.950 --> 01:06:14.000
actually, a statistical
mechanics example as well--

01:06:17.450 --> 01:06:19.880
is the log of n factorial.

01:06:19.880 --> 01:06:21.250
So we're going to approximate
the log of n

01:06:21.250 --> 01:06:24.230
factorial using pictures.

01:06:24.230 --> 01:06:25.780
Now why n factorial?

01:06:25.780 --> 01:06:27.010
Well, what is n factorial?

01:06:27.010 --> 01:06:30.270
5 factorial is 5 times 4 times
3 times 2 times 1.

01:06:30.270 --> 01:06:31.660
Why do we care about it?

01:06:31.660 --> 01:06:33.610
It's the most important function
in statistical

01:06:33.610 --> 01:06:35.620
mechanics when you're
counting objects.

01:06:35.620 --> 01:06:39.200
And it shows up in probability
theory all the time.

01:06:39.200 --> 01:06:41.330
And statistical mechanics
has a lot of

01:06:41.330 --> 01:06:43.090
particles, so the n is big.

01:06:43.090 --> 01:06:45.700
So we'd like to approximate
how big n factorial is,

01:06:45.700 --> 01:06:47.810
because it's so big we
take the logarithm.

01:06:47.810 --> 01:06:49.680
OK, let's see if we can
approximate the logarithm

01:06:49.680 --> 01:06:50.930
using pictures.

01:06:54.630 --> 01:06:59.300
So log of n factorial is the
area of those rectangles.

01:06:59.300 --> 01:07:05.014
You can see rectangle for log
2, log 3, log 4, log 5,

01:07:05.014 --> 01:07:07.010
log 6, and log 7.

01:07:07.010 --> 01:07:14.020
And log of n factorial is just
the sum of all of those.

01:07:14.020 --> 01:07:18.220
Say, 3 factorial is 3 times 2
times 1, so log of 3 factorial

01:07:18.220 --> 01:07:21.932
is log of 3, plus log
of 2, plus log of 1.

01:07:21.932 --> 01:07:24.690
Log of 1 is 0, so all you
have left is those

01:07:24.690 --> 01:07:26.580
rectangles to add up.

01:07:26.580 --> 01:07:28.665
OK, so now let's add them
up, approximately.

01:07:31.370 --> 01:07:35.550
So the area under the curve is
your first approximation.

01:07:35.550 --> 01:07:38.220
So the curve is just log k.

01:07:38.220 --> 01:07:39.070
So let's see what that is.

01:07:39.070 --> 01:07:42.140
Well, OK, that's just the
integral of log k from 1 to n,

01:07:42.140 --> 01:07:44.610
from the lower limit
to the upper limit.

01:07:44.610 --> 01:07:46.880
So that we can just do
symbolically, you get n log n

01:07:46.880 --> 01:07:49.370
minus n plus 1.

01:07:49.370 --> 01:07:50.830
OK, now the error.

01:07:50.830 --> 01:07:52.140
Where does the error
come from?

01:07:52.140 --> 01:07:55.770
Well, it comes from
the protrusions

01:07:55.770 --> 01:07:57.830
beyond the log n curve.

01:08:00.470 --> 01:08:02.780
So there you have
the protrusions.

01:08:02.780 --> 01:08:05.010
so we'd like to add up all
those protrusions.

01:08:05.010 --> 01:08:06.400
Well, how are we going
to do that?

01:08:09.200 --> 01:08:12.080
Each piece is almost
a triangle.

01:08:12.080 --> 01:08:15.720
So let's just straighten out
each little piece of log k

01:08:15.720 --> 01:08:16.974
curve, and make triangles.

01:08:19.660 --> 01:08:23.229
And now, it turns out they're
much easier to add up if you

01:08:23.229 --> 01:08:27.850
double them, and make every
triangle into a rectangle.

01:08:27.850 --> 01:08:30.510
OK, so now I'm going to stop
here, and see if you can

01:08:30.510 --> 01:08:32.600
figure out how to add up
all of those pieces.

01:08:32.600 --> 01:08:36.189
What's the sum of all of
those shaded regions?

01:08:36.189 --> 01:08:37.950
Take a minute and check
with your neighbor.

01:08:41.729 --> 01:08:43.750
OK, when you see it,
raise your hand.

01:08:50.670 --> 01:08:54.060
Find someone around who sees
it, if you haven't seen it,

01:08:54.060 --> 01:08:56.220
and check with them.

01:08:56.220 --> 01:08:57.680
Because it is fun to see.

01:08:57.680 --> 01:08:59.170
I don't want to spoil
it unnecessarily.

01:09:05.520 --> 01:09:06.770
Here's a little hint.

01:09:09.800 --> 01:09:14.029
So what you do, is you hold your
hand at the right page,

01:09:14.029 --> 01:09:16.779
and you whack all of the
rectangles, and they slide

01:09:16.779 --> 01:09:21.510
across, and go psssssh, and
stack, and form the last one.

01:09:21.510 --> 01:09:24.670
So that means the sum of all the
corrections, times 2, is

01:09:24.670 --> 01:09:26.149
the last rectangle.

01:09:26.149 --> 01:09:31.979
So log 7, or log n, is twice
your error, roughly.

01:09:31.979 --> 01:09:34.479
So now you just combine the
integral, which is the piece

01:09:34.479 --> 01:09:38.090
under the curve, with the
approximated protrusion, and

01:09:38.090 --> 01:09:40.910
you get that for log
of n factorial.

01:09:40.910 --> 01:09:41.779
So let's see.

01:09:41.779 --> 01:09:44.689
So that is actually very close
to Stirling's formula.

01:09:44.689 --> 01:09:45.670
Let's see how close it is.

01:09:45.670 --> 01:09:47.399
Well where's the error?

01:09:47.399 --> 01:09:51.130
Well, the error comes from when
we straightened out the

01:09:51.130 --> 01:09:55.550
pieces of the log k curve, and
made triangles instead of the

01:09:55.550 --> 01:09:56.900
funny-shaped region.

01:09:56.900 --> 01:10:00.990
So the error is those shaded
guys, which is not very big.

01:10:00.990 --> 01:10:03.120
And most of the error happens
low down, so if you just

01:10:03.120 --> 01:10:05.640
corrected for that, pretty much
it would all go So here

01:10:05.640 --> 01:10:06.920
is the total error.

01:10:06.920 --> 01:10:08.690
Here's an example.

01:10:08.690 --> 01:10:13.930
The picture method, so we get 7
factorial, gives you 8.594.

01:10:13.930 --> 01:10:18.030
The exact answer for the logs
of 7 factorial, 8.525.

01:10:18.030 --> 01:10:20.390
So it's an error only 0.07.

01:10:20.390 --> 01:10:25.040
So all of this just
adds up to 0.07.

01:10:25.040 --> 01:10:30.480
Which ends up being a 7% error
in seven factorial.

01:10:30.480 --> 01:10:34.730
So the moral of the story is
that pictures can help you

01:10:34.730 --> 01:10:37.830
approximate log of n factorial,
and here is your

01:10:37.830 --> 01:10:40.060
approximation.

01:10:40.060 --> 01:10:42.930
So one of the most important
functions

01:10:42.930 --> 01:10:46.080
in statistical mechanics.

01:10:46.080 --> 01:10:49.840
95% with pictures, and
one tiny integral.

01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:52.820
OK, now.

01:10:52.820 --> 01:10:56.190
That's an example or something
you could do if you wanted to

01:10:56.190 --> 01:10:57.520
teach it using slides.

01:10:57.520 --> 01:10:59.730
You could easily do that on the
blackboard, and normally I

01:10:59.730 --> 01:11:00.780
teach it on the blackboard.

01:11:00.780 --> 01:11:04.220
But I made this as an exercise
for myself to say, OK, well

01:11:04.220 --> 01:11:06.900
suppose I have to teach it with
slides, what would I do?

01:11:06.900 --> 01:11:08.150
And you notice here.

01:11:11.440 --> 01:11:19.590
So when I first drafted it,
this slide was missing.

01:11:19.590 --> 01:11:24.880
And I went from here
to there directly.

01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:27.810
And then I thought,
oh, actually--

01:11:27.810 --> 01:11:29.810
so this is about the
interactivity question--

01:11:29.810 --> 01:11:32.130
oh, actually I'm depriving
people of a chance to think

01:11:32.130 --> 01:11:34.000
about something,
and realize it.

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.290
On the board, it's really
easy to pause.

01:11:36.290 --> 01:11:39.530
You just put the picture
up, and you wait.

01:11:39.530 --> 01:11:40.940
And you say, OK, what
do you think?

01:11:40.940 --> 01:11:42.380
And then you start
drawing stuff.

01:11:42.380 --> 01:11:44.660
So I thought, OK, well you can
actually simulate that on

01:11:44.660 --> 01:11:45.380
slides, too.

01:11:45.380 --> 01:11:48.470
So I put the intervening slide
in there, so that people had a

01:11:48.470 --> 01:11:53.880
chance to stop here, and think
about the result before we

01:11:53.880 --> 01:11:57.620
continued on to the solution,
where it adds

01:11:57.620 --> 01:11:59.930
up to the last guy.

01:11:59.930 --> 01:12:05.800
So that's an example of
basically somewhat interactive

01:12:05.800 --> 01:12:07.510
slide teaching of a
mathematical idea.

01:12:07.510 --> 01:12:07.920
Yes.

01:12:07.920 --> 01:12:11.000
AUDIENCE: So why didn't you
animate a slide [INAUDIBLE]

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:12.632
with boxes to take advantage?

01:12:12.632 --> 01:12:14.380
PROFESSOR: That's
a good question.

01:12:14.380 --> 01:12:15.230
Why didn't I?

01:12:15.230 --> 01:12:18.740
Actually, because, A, I
didn't think of it,

01:12:18.740 --> 01:12:19.990
but it's a good idea.

01:12:25.780 --> 01:12:27.060
I should have probably
done it.

01:12:27.060 --> 01:12:30.640
The problem is that I'm showing
it as a PDF file,

01:12:30.640 --> 01:12:32.890
rather than through
any program.

01:12:32.890 --> 01:12:35.090
So PDF animations--

01:12:35.090 --> 01:12:37.910
I don't know if PDF has
animations in it.

01:12:37.910 --> 01:12:39.110
It probably doesn't.

01:12:39.110 --> 01:12:40.110
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:12:40.110 --> 01:12:42.510
PROFESSOR: Yes, that's true,
it's sort of against the

01:12:42.510 --> 01:12:45.312
purpose of PDF, which
is a stable format.

01:12:45.312 --> 01:12:46.728
Yes.

01:12:46.728 --> 01:12:48.852
AUDIENCE: I actually thought
this entire presentation was

01:12:48.852 --> 01:12:51.838
really clear, and would be just
as good as if you did it

01:12:51.838 --> 01:12:52.392
on a blackboard.

01:12:52.392 --> 01:12:58.609
Because it was interactive,
slow, had pacing, the suspense

01:12:58.609 --> 01:13:00.517
of having us ask
the questions.

01:13:00.517 --> 01:13:03.598
So I think one of the major
reasons why I would be opposed

01:13:03.598 --> 01:13:06.088
[? to teaching ?] in this way,
is just because it takes you

01:13:06.088 --> 01:13:08.578
more time to create the slide.

01:13:08.578 --> 01:13:10.902
From my own experience, it
takes a long time to make

01:13:10.902 --> 01:13:12.562
really good slides, just
fiddling around with

01:13:12.562 --> 01:13:13.558
[INAUDIBLE].

01:13:13.558 --> 01:13:16.712
So I think if you could spend
all the energy we're spending

01:13:16.712 --> 01:13:18.040
on slides instead
on [INAUDIBLE]--

01:13:18.040 --> 01:13:18.550
PROFESSOR: That's
a good point.

01:13:18.550 --> 01:13:20.036
AUDIENCE: --or whatever,
I think that might be

01:13:20.036 --> 01:13:22.370
[INAUDIBLE].

01:13:22.370 --> 01:13:24.120
PROFESSOR: I think that is
a really good point.

01:13:24.120 --> 01:13:26.400
And I hadn't thought of it until
you mentioned it, but

01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:27.700
you're right.

01:13:27.700 --> 01:13:30.780
It took me a long time to
make the slides right.

01:13:30.780 --> 01:13:34.510
To do slides well, you have to
really think about the visual

01:13:34.510 --> 01:13:36.290
presentation, make everything
visual, you're

01:13:36.290 --> 01:13:39.090
making a lot of diagrams.

01:13:39.090 --> 01:13:40.520
There's all kinds of
little tweaks.

01:13:40.520 --> 01:13:43.370
Like, I made sure that all the
diagrams are exactly the same

01:13:43.370 --> 01:13:45.810
size, so that when you flip from
slide to slide, you don't

01:13:45.810 --> 01:13:47.840
get a shift.

01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:49.770
So all those things, you don't
have to worry about on the

01:13:49.770 --> 01:13:50.550
chalkboard.

01:13:50.550 --> 01:13:53.530
And yes, I would advise people,
just as you do, to

01:13:53.530 --> 01:13:56.380
spend that time thinking about
your teaching, and where

01:13:56.380 --> 01:13:57.980
you're going to put the
interactivity in.

01:13:57.980 --> 01:13:59.070
And do it on the blackboard.

01:13:59.070 --> 01:14:01.230
So this is something where,
with a lot of effort, the

01:14:01.230 --> 01:14:03.750
slide reaches to the level
of the blackboard.

01:14:03.750 --> 01:14:06.320
But with colored chalk, and
lots of blackboard, the

01:14:06.320 --> 01:14:10.200
blackboard is just as
good, and quicker.

01:14:10.200 --> 01:14:13.450
And the blackboard has the
advantage that this could be

01:14:13.450 --> 01:14:15.160
two blackboards in your class.

01:14:15.160 --> 01:14:18.750
Say it's a class about visual
representations, and you have

01:14:18.750 --> 01:14:20.920
two blackboards for
this thing.

01:14:20.920 --> 01:14:23.800
The middle two blackboards for
yet another example, the end

01:14:23.800 --> 01:14:25.240
two blackboards for yet
another example.

01:14:25.240 --> 01:14:26.846
And you have all of
them at once.

01:14:26.846 --> 01:14:27.332
Yes.

01:14:27.332 --> 01:14:32.020
AUDIENCE: Last time I taught a
class where I used all slides,

01:14:32.020 --> 01:14:34.395
and when I put the amount of
time that, things like you put

01:14:34.395 --> 01:14:37.186
into this, to make them all so
they perfectly line up, and

01:14:37.186 --> 01:14:39.270
the animations were really
helpful and everything, just

01:14:39.270 --> 01:14:41.270
creating the slides probably
took half the overall time

01:14:41.270 --> 01:14:43.020
that I put into the class.

01:14:43.020 --> 01:14:45.852
But I think the one advantage
was I was able to use

01:14:45.852 --> 01:14:49.020
printouts of those handouts
as class notes.

01:14:49.020 --> 01:14:50.520
Which I handed out
after the class.

01:14:50.520 --> 01:14:51.520
They didn't have them
during class.

01:14:51.520 --> 01:14:55.280
So that's the only advantage, is
you can reuse all of these

01:14:55.280 --> 01:14:56.430
[INAUDIBLE].

01:14:56.430 --> 01:14:57.520
PROFESSOR: And that's
exactly true.

01:14:57.520 --> 01:15:02.180
So all these nice figures, we
did it for this class, and for

01:15:02.180 --> 01:15:04.250
a seminar on making slides.

01:15:04.250 --> 01:15:07.260
And then I used them verbatim
in my Street-Fighting

01:15:07.260 --> 01:15:08.720
Mathematics textbook.

01:15:08.720 --> 01:15:11.210
So basically, to make good
slides requires making

01:15:11.210 --> 01:15:13.500
something pretty much
publication quality.

01:15:13.500 --> 01:15:15.060
And then, you do have something
publication quality,

01:15:15.060 --> 01:15:17.050
but maybe the first time you
teach it, that's not where you

01:15:17.050 --> 01:15:19.360
want to be spending your time.

01:15:19.360 --> 01:15:21.370
There was one other point that
was raised in an email

01:15:21.370 --> 01:15:24.460
beforehand, which is, in
Jean-luc's paper, he mentioned

01:15:24.460 --> 01:15:28.430
that he uses less popular
alternatives to the Microsoft

01:15:28.430 --> 01:15:30.570
software for making slides.

01:15:30.570 --> 01:15:33.390
So, yeah, I highly do not
recommend using Microsoft

01:15:33.390 --> 01:15:37.160
software, because it's
not free software.

01:15:37.160 --> 01:15:40.840
And it's, I think, unethical
to use non-free software.

01:15:40.840 --> 01:15:43.130
Free software meaning freely
licensed, so you change the

01:15:43.130 --> 01:15:45.480
source code, view the source
code, make your own versions,

01:15:45.480 --> 01:15:46.340
do whatever you want.

01:15:46.340 --> 01:15:47.440
And it's none of that.

01:15:47.440 --> 01:15:50.220
Second, it's all proprietary
formats.

01:15:50.220 --> 01:15:51.590
So you're encouraging
other people to

01:15:51.590 --> 01:15:53.490
use proprietary formats.

01:15:53.490 --> 01:15:57.480
No one has fully debugged, and
decoded, all the formats that

01:15:57.480 --> 01:15:58.660
Microsoft uses.

01:15:58.660 --> 01:16:01.360
So you should use open
formats at least.

01:16:01.360 --> 01:16:03.270
Now, you could use Open Office,
but the problem is

01:16:03.270 --> 01:16:06.960
Open Office, the whole model of
the way it does slides is

01:16:06.960 --> 01:16:09.510
kind of yuck, because it's
just copied from

01:16:09.510 --> 01:16:10.460
the Microsoft way.

01:16:10.460 --> 01:16:11.870
So actually I prefer--

01:16:11.870 --> 01:16:14.520
maybe it's because of my
computer science math

01:16:14.520 --> 01:16:15.140
background--

01:16:15.140 --> 01:16:19.360
what I prefer is to program
all the slides.

01:16:19.360 --> 01:16:21.780
So let's see.

01:16:21.780 --> 01:16:23.510
[? Log.tech. ?]

01:16:23.510 --> 01:16:24.860
Where are the-- yeah.

01:16:24.860 --> 01:16:26.540
OK.

01:16:26.540 --> 01:16:30.850
So I actually write in
[? Tech, ?] or version of

01:16:30.850 --> 01:16:31.850
[? Tech. ?]

01:16:31.850 --> 01:16:34.030
And here is your title
of the slide.

01:16:34.030 --> 01:16:36.102
And I can change the
formatting later.

01:16:36.102 --> 01:16:38.250
AUDIENCE: Maybe that's what
took you so long.

01:16:38.250 --> 01:16:39.960
PROFESSOR: Maybe.

01:16:39.960 --> 01:16:40.350
Maybe.

01:16:40.350 --> 01:16:41.380
But the thing is,
you can't make

01:16:41.380 --> 01:16:44.170
publication-quality stuff otherwise.

01:16:44.170 --> 01:16:46.240
So if you're going to actually
do a good slide, basically you

01:16:46.240 --> 01:16:47.270
want to do that.

01:16:47.270 --> 01:16:49.190
Otherwise, I don't think
people should bother.

01:16:49.190 --> 01:16:51.776
And mathematical typesetting is
just ghastly unless you use

01:16:51.776 --> 01:16:51.870
[? Tech ?].

01:16:51.870 --> 01:16:53.070
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:16:53.070 --> 01:16:55.110
PROFESSOR: Oh.

01:16:55.110 --> 01:16:57.270
And I don't think you can
make it look as nice.

01:16:57.270 --> 01:16:59.380
And I'm speaking here about Open
Office, and it's probably

01:16:59.380 --> 01:17:03.530
a clone of rubbish
that it replaces.

01:17:03.530 --> 01:17:06.310
The mathematical typesetting
is just not as good.

01:17:06.310 --> 01:17:08.090
And so for technical
presentations,

01:17:08.090 --> 01:17:09.260
it's just not as good.

01:17:09.260 --> 01:17:12.180
So now, making the figures, I
have the same philosophy.

01:17:12.180 --> 01:17:16.526
So the figures I actually
program as well.

01:17:16.526 --> 01:17:18.310
Where is that fig [INAUDIBLE].

01:17:21.300 --> 01:17:23.080
So here are the figures.

01:17:23.080 --> 01:17:27.010
So this is a function that
draws logarithm graphs.

01:17:27.010 --> 01:17:29.480
And then I tell it which parts
of the graph to put in.

01:17:29.480 --> 01:17:30.920
So that's how I do the--

01:17:30.920 --> 01:17:33.360
you draw all the lines, you
drew all the pieces.

01:17:33.360 --> 01:17:36.880
And then here I call it with
different arguments, and I get

01:17:36.880 --> 01:17:38.550
different figures.

01:17:38.550 --> 01:17:40.720
So I'll put all the source code
up for you guys, so you

01:17:40.720 --> 01:17:43.160
can see an alternative
way of doing it.

01:17:43.160 --> 01:17:45.720
And some links, so you
can try it yourself.

01:17:45.720 --> 01:17:47.490
And some templates.

01:17:47.490 --> 01:17:49.740
But it's not for everyone.

01:17:49.740 --> 01:17:52.045
Though it is a public format.

01:17:52.045 --> 01:17:54.380
It produces PDF, which
is a public format.

01:17:54.380 --> 01:17:58.200
So I actually highly recommend
it for those who have at all

01:17:58.200 --> 01:18:00.090
some programming affinity.

01:18:00.090 --> 01:18:03.440
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] programs
that ends up as PDF format.

01:18:03.440 --> 01:18:04.240
PROFESSOR: That has
the advantage of

01:18:04.240 --> 01:18:07.430
PDF, which is good.

01:18:07.430 --> 01:18:09.850
So I do recommend presenting
things as PDF because you can

01:18:09.850 --> 01:18:11.060
view it on anything.

01:18:11.060 --> 01:18:13.020
It's just, you have the problem
of, do you have good

01:18:13.020 --> 01:18:14.930
mathematical typesetting.

01:18:14.930 --> 01:18:16.870
And that's hard to find,
except [? in Tech, ?]

01:18:16.870 --> 01:18:17.510
basically.

01:18:17.510 --> 01:18:19.650
That's the only thing
that does it right.

01:18:19.650 --> 01:18:21.520
OK, so if you could just
take one minute,

01:18:21.520 --> 01:18:23.750
fill out the sheets.

01:18:23.750 --> 01:18:26.220
I'll answer the questions
next time.

01:18:26.220 --> 01:18:28.180
I'll have office
hours as usual.

01:18:28.180 --> 01:18:30.730
We'll meet outside that door.

01:18:30.730 --> 01:18:34.790
And then we'll go to the cafe
area, and have a chat at the

01:18:34.790 --> 01:18:38.160
tables, as long as people
have questions.

01:18:38.160 --> 01:18:43.730
OK, so, the moral the story is
use the blackboard if you can.

01:18:43.730 --> 01:18:45.300
Use the big visual field.

01:18:45.300 --> 01:18:48.470
But if you're going to use
slides, Assertion-Evidence.

01:18:48.470 --> 01:18:49.560
Sentence headline.

01:18:49.560 --> 01:18:50.830
Visual evidence.

01:18:50.830 --> 01:18:53.890
One message per slide.

01:18:53.890 --> 01:18:56.210
Answers from lecture
nine, to questions

01:18:56.210 --> 01:18:58.690
generated in lecture eight.

01:18:58.690 --> 01:19:01.970
Audio quality for this video
is poor due to technical

01:19:01.970 --> 01:19:04.852
difficulties.

01:19:04.852 --> 01:19:06.102
PROFESSOR: [INAUDIBLE]

01:19:08.303 --> 01:19:10.768
is I'd like to go through the
questions from before.

01:19:14.219 --> 01:19:18.656
There's one question from the
time before, which is, could I

01:19:18.656 --> 01:19:21.614
get the reference for the works
that said, there's a

01:19:21.614 --> 01:19:24.572
difference between telling
people that they have

01:19:24.572 --> 01:19:27.530
intrinsic abilities-- saying,
oh, you did that because you

01:19:27.530 --> 01:19:29.995
are really smart, versus, oh you
did that because you tried

01:19:29.995 --> 01:19:30.981
really hard.

01:19:30.981 --> 01:19:34.866
And how those two ways of
talking to people-- and

01:19:34.866 --> 01:19:36.363
children especially--

01:19:36.363 --> 01:19:39.835
produced different interests,
and confidence

01:19:39.835 --> 01:19:41.468
in trying new problems.

01:19:41.468 --> 01:19:45.053
I mentioned that that work was
done a lot by a Professor at

01:19:45.053 --> 01:19:46.726
Stanford, in the Psychology
Department.

01:19:46.726 --> 01:19:48.160
Could I get a reference
for it?

01:19:48.160 --> 01:19:51.059
The next update of the website
will have the reference, with

01:19:51.059 --> 01:20:02.230
the reference is Carol Dweck,
D-W-E-C-K. And she's written a

01:20:02.230 --> 01:20:03.712
ton of books, and papers.

01:20:03.712 --> 01:20:10.134
But the one that [INAUDIBLE]
popular, [INAUDIBLE]

01:20:10.134 --> 01:20:13.098
is called Mindset.

01:20:13.098 --> 01:20:16.556
Which is a really, really
fascinating read.

01:20:16.556 --> 01:20:20.508
So that will be on
the website.

01:20:20.508 --> 01:20:21.002
OK.

01:20:21.002 --> 01:20:24.954
First question was, you
mentioned many times, problems

01:20:24.954 --> 01:20:30.470
that are PDF-- pass, D, or F,
where P is made a decent

01:20:30.470 --> 01:20:36.030
effort, D is made an indecent
effort, and F is

01:20:36.030 --> 01:20:38.085
didn't make an effort.

01:20:38.085 --> 01:20:41.055
That's great, but then how do
you balance that with the fact

01:20:41.055 --> 01:20:45.015
that exams become high-stakes,
hit-or-miss performances that

01:20:45.015 --> 01:20:46.995
completely determine grades.

01:20:46.995 --> 01:20:49.470
I don't use the exams
that way.

01:20:49.470 --> 01:20:51.780
I give exams, they're balanced
with the problem sets.

01:20:51.780 --> 01:20:56.424
The problem sets are PDF, and if
you do P on all the problem

01:20:56.424 --> 01:20:59.247
sets, that contributes a large
part of your grade, towards

01:20:59.247 --> 01:21:04.410
getting an A. So there's no
necessity to make the exams

01:21:04.410 --> 01:21:05.378
all or nothing.

01:21:05.378 --> 01:21:07.800
Problem sets still account
for quite a bit.

01:21:07.800 --> 01:21:09.654
[INAUDIBLE]

01:21:09.654 --> 01:21:14.347
It's just you're not forcing the
students to get every last

01:21:14.347 --> 01:21:18.052
T, and dot every last I, which
often means going through

01:21:18.052 --> 01:21:19.534
[INAUDIBLE] to try
to do all that.

01:21:19.534 --> 01:21:22.004
Instead, you're saying, look,
I want you to try to learn

01:21:22.004 --> 01:21:23.650
something big, important.

01:21:23.650 --> 01:21:28.080
If you take responsibility,
then, you get a reward for

01:21:28.080 --> 01:21:32.660
that, by saying, OK, that'll
help your grade, too.

01:21:32.660 --> 01:21:34.245
About slide talks.

01:21:34.245 --> 01:21:37.210
Were there any questions about
slides talks versus teaching,

01:21:37.210 --> 01:21:40.450
versus blackboards.

01:21:40.450 --> 01:21:43.386
So one of the papers says that
the best usage of slides is as

01:21:43.386 --> 01:21:46.510
a completed form that's
understandable without the

01:21:46.510 --> 01:21:49.170
talk that comes with it.

01:21:49.170 --> 01:21:51.380
Is that for a research talk?

01:21:51.380 --> 01:21:53.970
Yes, for a research seminar,
that's what you want.

01:21:53.970 --> 01:21:55.390
You want two channels.

01:21:55.390 --> 01:22:01.340
You want the auditory channel,
and the slide channel, or the

01:22:01.340 --> 01:22:02.515
visual channel--

01:22:02.515 --> 01:22:04.790
whatever's on the blackboard,
however you do it.

01:22:04.790 --> 01:22:08.090
You want them to stand
independently.

01:22:08.090 --> 01:22:12.495
So if people are deaf, and they
just see the slides, they

01:22:12.495 --> 01:22:14.120
get something out of the talk.

01:22:14.120 --> 01:22:16.990
And if they're blind, and they
just hear your speech, they

01:22:16.990 --> 01:22:18.740
get something out of the talk.

01:22:18.740 --> 01:22:22.660
That's, I would say, less
true for teaching.

01:22:22.660 --> 01:22:26.980
The slides tend not to be so,
message, message, message.

01:22:26.980 --> 01:22:31.356
You may develop a point, build
up a bit of suspense, and then

01:22:31.356 --> 01:22:33.488
give a final message.

01:22:33.488 --> 01:22:38.900
So there's more interaction that
happens from the lecture,

01:22:38.900 --> 01:22:40.130
generally, when you're
teaching, than

01:22:40.130 --> 01:22:42.344
in a research seminar.

01:22:42.344 --> 01:22:43.380
So those are somewhat
different.

01:22:43.380 --> 01:22:46.200
But generally, you do want
your slides, or your

01:22:46.200 --> 01:22:50.154
blackboard work, to somehow
stand independently.

01:22:50.154 --> 01:22:52.589
Although I've just violated that
principle right there.

01:22:52.589 --> 01:22:56.972
This is meaningless unless
you've heard what I said.

01:22:56.972 --> 01:22:59.407
But as I said, it's not
an absolute rule.

01:22:59.407 --> 01:23:01.842
It's just that there's
tendencies that are different

01:23:01.842 --> 01:23:04.277
between [INAUDIBLE] talks,
and teaching.

01:23:04.277 --> 01:23:07.502
What do you do if you're
assigned to a classroom with a

01:23:07.502 --> 01:23:08.150
bad blackboard situation.

01:23:08.150 --> 01:23:09.122
In other words, not like this.

01:23:09.122 --> 01:23:11.070
This is fantastic.

01:23:11.070 --> 01:23:13.710
It would be even more ideal if
there was a slide [INAUDIBLE].

01:23:13.710 --> 01:23:17.510
But what do you do if you go
to a classroom with, for

01:23:17.510 --> 01:23:19.928
example, just one whiteboard,
or just one or two

01:23:19.928 --> 01:23:20.916
blackboards?

01:23:20.916 --> 01:23:23.386
Then you have to work harder.

01:23:23.386 --> 01:23:26.844
Then you have to plan even more
carefully, how are you

01:23:26.844 --> 01:23:27.832
going to use the blackboard.

01:23:27.832 --> 01:23:30.302
And be more telegraphic.

01:23:30.302 --> 01:23:33.513
Put coarser details
on the boards, not

01:23:33.513 --> 01:23:34.254
every single detail.

01:23:34.254 --> 01:23:35.736
Use the notes more.

01:23:35.736 --> 01:23:39.194
So you optimize the constraints
that you have.

01:23:42.652 --> 01:23:44.920
Should you only use the front
half of the room.

01:23:44.920 --> 01:23:47.870
Suppose you're in a room which
has blackboards all around.

01:23:47.870 --> 01:23:49.490
Should you only use the front
half of the room?

01:23:49.490 --> 01:23:52.187
Yeah, I generally try to use
only the front half of the

01:23:52.187 --> 01:23:56.042
room, because people can look at
that, and glance out of the

01:23:56.042 --> 01:23:59.280
side of their eye at the side,
and then, the front as well.

01:23:59.280 --> 01:24:02.810
The back forces people to turn
around, so they're much less

01:24:02.810 --> 01:24:03.530
likely to use it.

01:24:03.530 --> 01:24:05.930
So it's sort of like putting
something on the ceiling.

01:24:05.930 --> 01:24:07.370
[INAUDIBLE] never see it.

01:24:07.370 --> 01:24:09.690
So generally, yeah, I use the
front of the room, and

01:24:09.690 --> 01:24:10.940
[INAUDIBLE] the side.

01:24:13.180 --> 01:24:17.359
Should all slides have a "so
what" element, or is that only

01:24:17.359 --> 01:24:18.990
for research talks?

01:24:18.990 --> 01:24:20.770
Definitely for a research talk,
all the slides should

01:24:20.770 --> 01:24:24.260
have a "so what," so people
know what the point is.

01:24:24.260 --> 01:24:27.084
And ideally, for teaching,
you should have two.

01:24:27.084 --> 01:24:30.230
Now, last time, I didn't mention
one of the fundamental

01:24:30.230 --> 01:24:32.420
benefits of putting
a "so what," an

01:24:32.420 --> 01:24:34.380
assertion, in every slide.

01:24:34.380 --> 01:24:35.630
So that was the idea.

01:24:47.120 --> 01:24:50.040
So the slide title is
the "so what.".

01:24:57.040 --> 01:25:01.040
And then here is the evidence,
maybe a picture, or a graph.

01:25:01.040 --> 01:25:02.540
Some kind of, ideally
visual, evidence.

01:25:02.540 --> 01:25:04.540
So what's the advantage
of doing that?

01:25:04.540 --> 01:25:05.945
It's not just for
the audience--

01:25:05.945 --> 01:25:07.540
it's for you, as well.

01:25:07.540 --> 01:25:10.750
What you do, after you make your
series of slides, with

01:25:10.750 --> 01:25:15.445
your sentences, your "so what."
You extract just the

01:25:15.445 --> 01:25:19.180
sentences, which is easy to do
if you're using a program

01:25:19.180 --> 01:25:20.176
[? like Tech. ?]

01:25:20.176 --> 01:25:22.168
You just [INAUDIBLE],
just the titles.

01:25:22.168 --> 01:25:23.164
However you do it.

01:25:23.164 --> 01:25:24.658
You make a list of sentences.

01:25:30.136 --> 01:25:34.006
And then you see whether
the sentences flow.

01:25:34.006 --> 01:25:37.742
With a sentence, you can tell,
very well, because whether

01:25:37.742 --> 01:25:40.442
your presentation, your
teaching, your seminar is well

01:25:40.442 --> 01:25:43.143
organized, if it herks and
jerks, if sentence one and

01:25:43.143 --> 01:25:45.107
sentence two seem to have
nothing to do with each other,

01:25:45.107 --> 01:25:48.360
there's no transition between
them, well, maybe you need a

01:25:48.360 --> 01:25:51.548
sentence one and a half, a slide
that goes in between.

01:25:51.548 --> 01:25:54.038
Or maybe sentence two belongs
down here, next to something

01:25:54.038 --> 01:25:55.034
that relates better.

01:25:55.034 --> 01:25:59.018
So you can see not just at the
level of the individual

01:25:59.018 --> 01:26:02.006
slides, but at the level of
the entire presentation,

01:26:02.006 --> 01:26:04.994
whether there's a thread
that goes through.

01:26:04.994 --> 01:26:07.680
And if you remember, one of
the principles of good

01:26:07.680 --> 01:26:09.650
teaching is having
a good story.

01:26:09.650 --> 01:26:11.808
So this helps you make
a good story.

01:26:25.030 --> 01:26:27.670
When you're teaching a class
that has expectations for

01:26:27.670 --> 01:26:30.850
teaching lots of material, how
do you reconcile your desire

01:26:30.850 --> 01:26:32.912
to teach the important things
really well, and keep a

01:26:32.912 --> 01:26:34.790
reasonable pace?

01:26:34.790 --> 01:26:38.390
Some things aren't really
reconcilable.

01:26:38.390 --> 01:26:41.190
Classes that, for example, say,
OK, we're going to go

01:26:41.190 --> 01:26:44.180
through the 1,600-page textbook,
there's really not

01:26:44.180 --> 01:26:45.790
much you can do to help that.

01:26:45.790 --> 01:26:47.902
And students are just hosed.

01:26:47.902 --> 01:26:51.430
But try to avoid that,
mitigate it.

01:26:51.430 --> 01:26:54.244
Sometimes it seems like, just
out of habit, everyone does

01:26:54.244 --> 01:26:55.328
that 1,600-page textbook.

01:26:55.328 --> 01:26:57.850
But you could find out, what are
the actual requirements?

01:26:57.850 --> 01:26:59.440
What do people need
for [INAUDIBLE]?

01:26:59.440 --> 01:27:01.470
If may be a lot less.

01:27:01.470 --> 01:27:04.132
It may be that a bunch of stuff
was just put in there

01:27:04.132 --> 01:27:05.554
historically, and could
be taken out.

01:27:05.554 --> 01:27:07.450
So you might have some freedom
to reduce that.

01:27:07.450 --> 01:27:10.461
The other thing is you put more
stuff in the notes, and

01:27:10.461 --> 01:27:13.898
you give the higher-level
ideas in the lecture.

01:27:22.736 --> 01:27:24.700
Can I put my slides on
the course web page?

01:27:24.700 --> 01:27:30.710
Yes, I'll do that, with the
reference, on the next update.

01:27:30.710 --> 01:27:33.850
What about having slides that
scroll rather than flip?

01:27:33.850 --> 01:27:37.330
This was a suggestion to avoid
the problem I mentioned of

01:27:37.330 --> 01:27:41.645
signal overload, where you fill
up the short-term memory

01:27:41.645 --> 01:27:43.435
with a slide, and then
you've forgotten

01:27:43.435 --> 01:27:45.600
what's on the old slide.

01:27:45.600 --> 01:27:47.829
And so, [INAUDIBLE]

01:27:47.829 --> 01:27:51.070
too small to remember
the whole slide.

01:27:51.070 --> 01:27:55.286
So what about having slides that
scroll, instead of flip.

01:27:55.286 --> 01:27:58.758
And this may be a critique
of the PDF format, which

01:27:58.758 --> 01:28:00.246
organizes things
in [? pages. ?]

01:28:00.246 --> 01:28:03.718
I think it's actually not a
critique of the PDF format,

01:28:03.718 --> 01:28:06.694
it's just a critique
of the PDF viewers.

01:28:06.694 --> 01:28:09.670
So if you have a PDF viewer that
can scroll, which many

01:28:09.670 --> 01:28:11.654
can, you could actually
use that.

01:28:11.654 --> 01:28:15.126
The problem is that screens
are not big enough.

01:28:15.126 --> 01:28:17.110
That's really the fundamental
issue.

01:28:21.574 --> 01:28:26.286
So if this slide is taking up
the entire screen space, when

01:28:26.286 --> 01:28:30.998
you scroll it, stuff goes off
these screens, and gets

01:28:30.998 --> 01:28:32.060
replaced by new stuff.

01:28:32.060 --> 01:28:35.050
So that problem is really
hard to work around.

01:28:35.050 --> 01:28:37.390
What you really need is multiple
screens, and multiple

01:28:37.390 --> 01:28:38.640
projectors.

01:28:41.760 --> 01:28:44.250
Many questions asked, what do
you do if you're in a room

01:28:44.250 --> 01:28:46.332
with a bad blackboard situation,
where you just have

01:28:46.332 --> 01:28:47.190
one or two blackboards.

01:28:47.190 --> 01:28:50.482
Well, almost every room has a
bad slide situation, because

01:28:50.482 --> 01:28:52.390
you only have one
slide projector.

01:28:52.390 --> 01:28:55.820
So you only use a small
part of the room.

01:28:55.820 --> 01:28:57.700
So that's the really fundamental
problem.

01:28:57.700 --> 01:28:59.700
And if you could get around
that, it wouldn't really

01:28:59.700 --> 01:29:02.660
matter so much whether the
slides scrolled or flipped.

01:29:02.660 --> 01:29:04.215
You'd put one over there,
one over there,

01:29:04.215 --> 01:29:05.523
maybe one over there.

01:29:05.523 --> 01:29:08.640
Of course now [INAUDIBLE].

01:29:08.640 --> 01:29:16.159
My guess is that the t prepare
is probably proportional to n

01:29:16.159 --> 01:29:17.387
cubed, or something like that.

01:29:17.387 --> 01:29:19.023
Depending on the number of
slide projectors you

01:29:19.023 --> 01:29:19.842
have to deal with.

01:29:19.842 --> 01:29:22.222
Because you have to do all the
coupling of [INAUDIBLE] n

01:29:22.222 --> 01:29:24.427
squared [INAUDIBLE].

01:29:24.427 --> 01:29:26.365
You'd have to do all the
coupling between all the

01:29:26.365 --> 01:29:28.932
slides, and it will probably
take you twelve hours for

01:29:28.932 --> 01:29:31.730
every lecture that you
give, of one hour.

01:29:31.730 --> 01:29:35.020
Which is kind of [INAUDIBLE].

01:29:35.020 --> 01:29:39.550
Do I think the video camera for
OCW impacts the style of

01:29:39.550 --> 01:29:42.900
my lectures, blackboards,
pacing, et cetera?

01:29:42.900 --> 01:29:44.955
If anything, it probably
improves it.

01:29:44.955 --> 01:29:47.850
Because I'm a little more
conscious that I write

01:29:47.850 --> 01:29:53.752
clearly, and maybe it improves
my dress code a bit, because I

01:29:53.752 --> 01:29:54.606
make sure to wear a tie.

01:29:54.606 --> 01:29:57.290
But other than that, it doesn't
really affect, too

01:29:57.290 --> 01:29:58.510
much, what I do.

01:29:58.510 --> 01:30:00.950
And I usually forget that
it's even there.

01:30:04.380 --> 01:30:06.647
It's much easier to write
equations [? in Tech, ?] and

01:30:06.647 --> 01:30:08.875
then copy and paste them into a
presentation, than doing the

01:30:08.875 --> 01:30:10.855
entire presentation
[? in Tech. ?]

01:30:10.855 --> 01:30:12.340
Actually, I disagree.

01:30:12.340 --> 01:30:17.140
This is a case of start-up
costs, versus running costs.

01:30:17.140 --> 01:30:19.800
So there's many examples
of that, here at issue.

01:30:22.800 --> 01:30:24.800
It's actually a general
principle worth knowing,

01:30:24.800 --> 01:30:26.300
because you can analyze
lots of stuff.

01:30:39.800 --> 01:30:43.770
Another example of this
principle is, suppose you see

01:30:43.770 --> 01:30:47.030
a book that you really like,
that's available in print,

01:30:47.030 --> 01:30:50.516
from publisher n, and there's
also a PDF file online.

01:30:50.516 --> 01:30:53.020
Well, you could just print it
out and replace your printer.

01:30:53.020 --> 01:30:55.510
Or, you could buy the thing
from the publisher.

01:30:55.510 --> 01:30:58.486
Now, unless the publisher's a
total thief -- unfortunately,

01:30:58.486 --> 01:31:01.485
many of them are, but many
of them aren't--

01:31:01.485 --> 01:31:05.672
it's usually much better to
buy it at the bookstore,

01:31:05.672 --> 01:31:09.249
because it's much cheaper, than
to print it on your laser

01:31:09.249 --> 01:31:11.634
printer, get all the paper
trimmed to the right size, and

01:31:11.634 --> 01:31:12.830
have it all bound.

01:31:12.830 --> 01:31:17.070
So the running cost for you to
do one book-- you have no

01:31:17.070 --> 01:31:20.830
start-up cost, you just do it.

01:31:20.830 --> 01:31:24.004
There's no fixed amount you
have to pay, no matter how

01:31:24.004 --> 01:31:25.144
many books you do.

01:31:25.144 --> 01:31:27.272
But there's a running cost,
and your running cost is

01:31:27.272 --> 01:31:28.340
pretty high.

01:31:28.340 --> 01:31:31.930
Whereas the publisher, they
have a big start-up cost.

01:31:31.930 --> 01:31:34.850
What they do, is they make all
these plates, they take them

01:31:34.850 --> 01:31:36.675
to a PDF file, [INAUDIBLE],
they make all these metal

01:31:36.675 --> 01:31:39.240
plates, and they ink
the metal plates,

01:31:39.240 --> 01:31:41.270
stamp it onto the paper.

01:31:41.270 --> 01:31:42.550
So they do all that.

01:31:42.550 --> 01:31:43.482
That's a big start-up cost.

01:31:43.482 --> 01:31:46.168
But their running cost
is much lower.

01:31:46.168 --> 01:31:49.310
They're much more efficient
printing, per book.

01:31:49.310 --> 01:31:51.166
But it requires all that
start-up cost.

01:31:51.166 --> 01:31:55.150
So there's a contrast between
book publishers and you.

01:31:55.150 --> 01:31:58.900
So it's the same thing,
actually, with doing

01:31:58.900 --> 01:31:59.780
[? Tech, ?]

01:31:59.780 --> 01:32:03.030
versus doing, say, regular
word processing.

01:32:03.030 --> 01:32:06.400
With [? Tech, ?] there's
a lot of start-up cost.

01:32:06.400 --> 01:32:08.280
No doubt about that.

01:32:08.280 --> 01:32:09.920
It's not what most people
are used to, you end up

01:32:09.920 --> 01:32:12.180
programming your documents.

01:32:12.180 --> 01:32:14.704
And so, if you're only making
one document, if you only

01:32:14.704 --> 01:32:18.522
write one letter in your life,
no question it's faster to

01:32:18.522 --> 01:32:19.690
write the letter.

01:32:19.690 --> 01:32:22.690
Your have lower running costs.

01:32:22.690 --> 01:32:24.894
You don't have to worry about
the start-up costs if you

01:32:24.894 --> 01:32:27.329
write it using a word
processing program--

01:32:27.329 --> 01:32:29.764
Open Office, for example.

01:32:29.764 --> 01:32:32.810
You just type, and you make it
look like you want, and just

01:32:32.810 --> 01:32:33.420
spit it out.

01:32:33.420 --> 01:32:37.412
But, if you have to write 50
letters that all have a

01:32:37.412 --> 01:32:39.380
roughly similar format,
it's much

01:32:39.380 --> 01:32:40.820
better to get the template.

01:32:40.820 --> 01:32:43.826
You pay the start-up cost once,
learn [? Tech, ?] learn

01:32:43.826 --> 01:32:45.950
some kind of program template.

01:32:45.950 --> 01:32:51.533
And then, you just enter the
blanks into the template.

01:32:51.533 --> 01:32:53.780
The text, dear who, the
address, and all that.

01:32:53.780 --> 01:32:54.940
[INAUDIBLE]

01:32:54.940 --> 01:32:57.550
formatting, that's all
dealt with once.

01:32:57.550 --> 01:33:00.892
So you pay start-up costs,
in return for

01:33:00.892 --> 01:33:01.874
lower running costs.

01:33:01.874 --> 01:33:03.838
And that's basically true
of lectures, too.

01:33:03.838 --> 01:33:06.293
Once you have all your templates
ready, it's much

01:33:06.293 --> 01:33:08.748
faster to do everything
[? in Tech, ?] or in some kind

01:33:08.748 --> 01:33:12.676
of programming, text-processing
system, rather

01:33:12.676 --> 01:33:15.131
than in a word processor.

01:33:18.080 --> 01:33:20.712
The problem is that, because
of the start-up costs,

01:33:20.712 --> 01:33:21.588
[INAUDIBLE]

01:33:21.588 --> 01:33:24.390
lecture the day before,
or two days before.

01:33:24.390 --> 01:33:27.458
Because of the start-up costs,
you always say, well, I could

01:33:27.458 --> 01:33:29.900
learn [? Tech, ?], and do this
properly, and it would save me

01:33:29.900 --> 01:33:33.525
a lot of time later, but I don't
have the time right now.

01:33:33.525 --> 01:33:37.590
And then you end up paying the
higher running cost to do it

01:33:37.590 --> 01:33:38.720
some other way.

01:33:38.720 --> 01:33:41.900
But each time, before each
lecture, it happens again,

01:33:41.900 --> 01:33:43.780
over and over and over again And
you would have been better

01:33:43.780 --> 01:33:48.384
off [INAUDIBLE] actually paying
the start-up cost.

01:33:48.384 --> 01:33:53.020
So, to that end, I will put my
templates up, so other people

01:33:53.020 --> 01:33:53.752
can use them.

01:33:53.752 --> 01:33:55.460
So you don't have to pay so much
start-up cost, and you

01:33:55.460 --> 01:33:58.632
can just take them, and use them
for your own [INAUDIBLE].

01:34:01.560 --> 01:34:07.585
So I think that was the main
questions for this time.

01:34:07.585 --> 01:34:09.920
Any questions that have been
created since then?

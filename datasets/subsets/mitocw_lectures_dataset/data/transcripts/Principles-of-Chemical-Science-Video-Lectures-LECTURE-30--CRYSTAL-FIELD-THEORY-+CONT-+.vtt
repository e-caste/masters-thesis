00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Some of you will recognize this
molecule that I have rotating up

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
on the screen because it is one
of the coordination complexes of

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Werner that we talked about last
time.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And Werner, of course,
was well-known.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
And some of you probably read
is biography over the last few

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
days on the Nobel Prize website.
Well-known for his theory that

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
broke down the preconceived
notions that had been prevailing

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
at that time concerning the
structure of systems that have

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
unusual salt-like behavior in
some cases, but that contain the

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
3D elements.
I am focusing on 3D,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
but this is also true of 4D and
5D elements, the transition

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
metals.
Elements like titanium,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
vanadium, chromium,
iron, cobalt,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
nickel, etc.
This molecule here,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
that you see spinning up on the
screen, is being represented

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
here on the screen in one of
these kind of arbitrary forms,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
wherein the cobalt center at
the middle of the molecule is

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
just a round ball of an
arbitrary size.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
And then, this particular
molecule that contains a cobalt

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
three ion is
surrounded by a compliment of

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
six ligands.
We have three chloride ligands,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.000
that because this program chose
to do so colored those chlorides

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
the same as the cobalt,
not what I would do,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
and put the three ammonia
ligands, colored the ammonia

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
nitrogens in dark blue,
and the ammonia hydrogens in

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
white.
And we talked about the fact

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
that these transition elements,
in fact, these 3+ ions of

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
metals like cobalt,
can behave simultaneously as

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Lewis acids toward a multitude
of Lewis bases,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
here six.
This is a times six Lewis acid

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000
in the middle and six Lewis
bases, which are three chloride

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
ions and three ammonia molecules
oriented around it,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
in an arrangement that is
quasi-octahedral.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Because the positions of the
three nitrogens of the ammonias

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
that are interacting with the
cobalt center and the three

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
chloride ions are located near
the vertices of a regular

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
octahedron.
So we will be taking use of the

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
geometry of molecules like this
in discussing electronic

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
structure properties of these
molecules today.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
We will be doing that beginning
today.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
And that will be important to
understanding the magnetism and

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
the color and also the reactions
of molecules like this.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Now, one other arbitrary thing
that this program did is it

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
chose not to draw lines between
the cobalt and any of the six

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000
ligands.
But normally,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
when you see these molecules
drawn in textbooks,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
you will see that the lines
drawn are the same as the lines

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
between the nitrogens and these
hydrogens.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
So we would have to add six
more lines to this drawing to

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
get the typical textbook
representation of a molecule

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
like this.
But, still, that would be a

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
somewhat arbitrary
representation.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000
And so, I would like to show
you a less arbitrary

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000
representation.
And we will do that forthwith.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000
And this one has to do with
looking at the same molecule,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:01.000
but represented as an electron
density isosurface.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000
And that isosurface will be
colored according to this

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.000
function, that tells us about
the propensity to pair electrons

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
in 3D space.
And so you will recall that

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000
when we talk about coloring
electron density isosurfaces in

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.000
this way, so this now is a
physically important kind of

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
representation of this
coordination complex,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:31.000
this color scale will run from
red all the way to blue.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
And at blue is where you find
regions in space where you are

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000
most likely to find pairs of
electrons mapped onto the value

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000
here, colored mapped onto the
value of an electron density

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
isosurface.
Here the value of the electron

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
density that is present for
every point represented on this

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
surface is 0.11 electrons per
unit volume.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
And so what you see here is
that, in fact,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
the electron density does
become low as you move from the

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.000
cobalt in the direction of any
one of the ligands.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
But the lone pair on each
ammonia is certainly polarized

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
in the direction of the cobalt
center.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000
And the cobalt center is not
uniform in terms of the way that

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
electron density is organized
around it.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
You will see that right on the
metal center,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
we see red.
And then sort of at the corners

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000
of a cube, you see this yellow
or green color on the cobalt,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000
and that is very significant.
And what we are going to be

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.000
today is we are going to try to
understand what happens when you

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000
put a set of ligands into an
octahedral array around a

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000
central metal ion that has
d-electrons and d orbitals to

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.000
play with.
And, in fact,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000
what you will see is that the
oxidation state of the cobalt

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000
center here is +3.
That is why I am referring to

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
it as a cobalt plus three ion.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000
And because cobalt is in group
nine of the periodic table,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000
you then know that there are
six valance electrons on the

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.000
cobalt center that you have to
put into orbitals.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
And so what we are really
seeking to know is how can we

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
get an energy-level diagram for
a system like this,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
so we will know how to put
those six electrons into that

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.000
diagram, the ones that are
mostly localized on the cobalt,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
and make predictions on whether
the electrons should be paired

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
up or not, for example.
We saw with homonuclear

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000
diatomics, like the dioxygen
molecule, that electrons are not

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
all paired up.
Two of the electrons are

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
unpaired.
And, when we have six electrons

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000
to put into an energy-level
diagram for the cobalt ion,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
we are going to wonder just
what the case is.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.000
How many energy levels are
there, and where do we put the

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
electrons?
And so we are going to need to

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000
very briefly review what I did
at end of lecture last time.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000
And that has to do with the
properties of the five d

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000
orbitals --
-- because, in order to answer

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:08.000
the kinds of questions that we
are posing about energy levels

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
of metal ions that are
transition metals,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.000
we are going to really need to
know very well the nodal

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:22.000
properties of these d orbitals.
And so, remember the m quantum

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.000
number here can be zero for the
d z squared.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.000
It can be plus one for the
d(xz).

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:38.000
And plus two for the d x
squared minus y squared.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.000
Minus one for the d(yz)

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.000
orbital.
And minus two for the d(xy)

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000
orbital.
And let's draw those.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:08:00.000
d z squared is an
interesting one.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000
And, because it is distinct
from the other four d orbitals,

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:09.000
we are going to be spending
more time on it today than the

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
others.
What it has,

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
these are the x,
let's say y and z axes here,

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:19.000
is it has a positive lobe along
both plus and minus z.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:24.000
So it looks like a p orbital so
far, except that we have the

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000
same sign both in plus or minus
z.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000
And then what we have is a very
interesting toroidal shape that

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000
goes around in the x,y-plane all
the way around in a

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000
cylindrically symmetric manner.
And so, if you were to look

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000
down z onto this orbital,
it might look something like

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.000
this.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
Like that.
It would be cylindrically

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000
symmetric about z.
And that was another feature

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:03.000
that I didn't get to add to this
diagram at the end of last hour,

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:08.000
which is that because of this
property, this m equals zero

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000
that means this is a sigma
orbital with respect to the

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000
z-axis.
Cylindrically symmetric about

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
z.
And then, let's go to the xz,

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
since I am making this x,
y, and z over here.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:27.000
The d(xz) has four lobes,
and they are in between the x

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:32.000
and z axes, as I am trying to
represent here.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.000
These two are kind of coming
out in front here,

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:46.000
and these two back behind.
And then, the phases go as

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
follows.
Unshaded is,

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000
again, plus.
And then we have the x squared

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:59.000
minus y squared
orbital, which has four lobes.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.000
In fact, the shape of xz,
x squared minus y squared,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
yz, and xy are all the
same.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000
It's just that they point in
different directions in space

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
with respect to the Cartesian
coordinate axes.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:18.000
x squared minus y squared,
like d z squared,

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:23.000
is an orbital whose
lobes point along the coordinate

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
axes, like this.
And it is minus along y,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
as the name suggests,
and plus along x,

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:34.000
as the name suggests.
That is our d x squared minus y

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
squared orbital.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:42.000
And then yz is like xz,
but let me finish this part

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
here.
If d z squared is

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:50.000
sigma with respect to z,
and you imagine looking down z

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:56.000
onto d(xz), what would that be
with respect to z?

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:02.000
Anyone.
Pi.
Thank you.
That would be pi with respect

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.000
to z, because the yz plane is a
nodal surface for this d

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:15.000
orbital, as is the x,y-plane.
And that is what we are trying

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:20.000
to do here, is become familiar
with these orbital surfaces.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000
And, accordingly,
now, if you look down z onto

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:29.000
the d x squared minus y squared
orbital,

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:34.000
you are now going to see two
nodal surfaces when you look

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:39.000
down it that way.
Because you are going to see

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
that there is one located over
here.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:47.000
That is a plane that contains
the z-axis, but it bisects the x

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
and y axes.
And then there is another one

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:55.000
over here, but that is 90
degrees to the first one.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:00.000
And that makes this one delta
with respect to z.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:06.000
Delta is when you have two
nodes that contain the z-axis

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000
and if we are looking down that
z-axis.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:16.000
And then, over here,
the d(yz) orbital has its four

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000
lobes between y and z,
like that.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:26.000
And it is positive between y
and z, and negative over here,

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:31.000
as I am shading.
And this one,

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000
like d(xz), is pi with respect
to z.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.000
And then, over here,
we have a d(xy) orbital as our

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
final orbital.
And what you might be able to

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.000
guess, we have a sigma with
respect to z,

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.000
we have a pair of pi with
respect to z for m equals plus

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.000
and minus one.
We also must have a pair of

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:59.000
delta with respect to z for m
equals plus and minus two.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.000
And that means that the d(xy)
orbital, like d x squared minus

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:08.000
y squared,
must lie in the x,y-plane.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:13.000
And, in order to be orthogonal
to d x squared minus y squared,

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.000
we are going to have to rotate
it such that its four lobes

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:22.000
point now between the x and y
Cartesian coordinate axes like

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.000
this, although I am trying to
improve on that with my

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.000
coloration.
That is like that.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:35.000
Again, this is an orbital
perpendicular to z and which has

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000
delta symmetry.
And now, the two nodes are,

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.000
in fact, the xz and yz
coordinate axes.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
Indicating those nodal planes
there.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:50.000
This is certainly the basics
for what you need to know about

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000
the d orbitals.
And just briefly,

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:57.000
I would like to switch to
Athena terminal,

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:02.000
here, to show you that there
are ways for you to go ahead and

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:08.000
visualize the orbitals.
And I am going to make this

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.000
information available to you,
so that you can go ahead and do

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000
this yourself in order to
visualize these in a way that

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:21.000
will take you right from the
equations for the orbitals to

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:25.000
their graphical representation.
I think that is really

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:30.000
important to get a good
understanding of orbitals.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:38.000
Let's zoom this a little bit,
so that you can begin to see

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.000
it.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
This is a worksheet put
together that,

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:54.000
in fact, contains all the
functional forms for the d

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
orbitals.
Let me see.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000
Where is that?
Here we go.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
And you can look at this with
Maple on Athena.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.000
And then, you can look at the
equation that represents the

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
angular part of the wave
function for the orbital that

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
you are interested in.
And then, you can go ahead and

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
plot it.
And you can plot it in such a

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
way that the function is
animated.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.000
And, rather than just seeing it
projected on a board as well as

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:25.000
I can draw, you will be able to
see it drawn up graphically.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:30.000
In fact, these come from the
solution for the Schrˆdinger

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:36.000
equation for the hydrogen atom.
And the angular part of these

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:42.000
wave functions that is going to
be oh so important to us is

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:48.000
something known as the set of
spherical harmonic equations.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:54.000
And that should reference you
to this issue of standing waves,

00:15:54.000 --> 00:16:00.000
that we have discussed.
Let's just see what we can do,

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000
here.
Sometimes, I am not so good at

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000
using Maple up in front of the
class.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.000
What you are seeing is we are
getting representations for d z

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000
squared.
Right here is a way of writing

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000
d z squared.
You are going to see an

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000
important term here,
three cosine squared theta

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000
minus one.
And we will come back to that

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000
in a moment.
That is the angular part of the

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.000
d z squared wave
function.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000
And then we can look at some of
these other ones.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:39.000
You will see that some of the d
orbitals come as combinations of

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.000
real and imaginary functions
that are the solutions to the

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.000
differential form of the
Schrˆdinger equation.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.000
And then we take linear
combinations of these to get

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.000
real forms, so that we can get
plots that we can look at.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:58.000
And let's see if we can get d z
squared,

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
here.
There it is.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.000
There is a picture of d z
squared.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000
And you see,
if you are using this Maple

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:12.000
worksheet, that you can actually
rotate that around and animate

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.000
it a little bit.
You see that we have this torus

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.000
that is in the x,y-plane.
And you have the two large

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.000
lobes that extend up along plus
and minus z.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:29.000
And so I am going to encourage
you to go ahead and look at that

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:35.000
worksheet, which will be
available from our website.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000
Go ahead and look at some of
the functions.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:41.000
And if some of you are
interested in higher orbitals,

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.000
the f orbitals are also
available in this worksheet.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.000
So you can visualize the f
orbitals, that are important for

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000
understanding the chemistry of
elements like,

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.000
for example,
uranium, which is a little bit

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.000
beyond the scope of 5.112.
Now let's switch to the

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:01.000
document camera.
And, if you could,

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:06.000
I would like you to make this
part big.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:11.000
This is a table in your
textbook that has the angular

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:18.000
part of the wave functions for
various hydrogen-like orbitals.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:23.000
And this is the part that I am
most interested in,

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:28.000
over here.
If you could just focus in on

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:34.000
the d orbitals over here.
When I was talking about the d

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.000
z squared orbital a
moment ago, I was focusing on

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.000
this term here,
this cosine squared theta minus

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000
one term.
And here are the other

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000
d-orbitals.
These are the descriptors for

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.000
the d-orbitals,
zy, yz, xz, x squared minus y

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.000
squared,
and z squared.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.000
And I will need to refer to
this in a moment,

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:59.000
so we will leave this up.
The reason why I have this

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:03.000
arrow written into my book here
is because these are backwards

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.000
in the text.
This one is actually x squared

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:10.000
minus y squared,
and this one is actually the xy

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.000
orbital.
We figured that out last year

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.000
when we were doing this lecture.
And so your book isn't always

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000
right.
You should make sure you check.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.000
The same is certainly true of
your instructor,

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.000
but we will try not to mislead
you.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:30.000
And so now here is the approach
that we are going to take.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.000
Let's say that we have our
coordinate system,

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.000
and we want to know how to
evaluate one of these d orbital

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.000
wave functions for a particular
point in space.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:53.000
Actually, we are going to want
to evaluate the square of the

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.000
wave function.
And so we are going to make use

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.000
of a Cartesian coordinate
system.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:02.000
And we are going to express
things in terms of polar

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.000
coordinates.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:15.000
Here is a sphere projected onto
our Cartesian coordinate system.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:20.000
And some of you will be very
familiar with this.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:25.000
We are going to say if you are
at a point here in space,

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:31.000
then we can describe that point
in space by a set of variables

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:35.000
which will be r,
theta, and phi.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:42.000
And here is our angle theta.
And if we drop down to a

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:49.000
perpendicular on the x,y-plane
from our point,

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:58.000
then we are going to define phi
as being from the x-axis and

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:04.000
going over in the direction of
y.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:08.000
And so, when you look at the d
orbital wave functions,

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:13.000
you see that they are all
written here in terms of just

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:16.000
theta and phi,
and not in terms of r,

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:20.000
which is this distance here
from the nucleus,

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:26.000
from the center of this metal
ion that we are talking about.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:30.000
This would be the r.
And what we are going to do,

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:35.000
is if this point on the surface
of our sphere represents one of

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:38.000
our ligand atoms,
so think back to that complex

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:43.000
we were describing a few moments
ago, cobalt with three ammonia

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.000
ligands and three chloride
ligands, we are going to

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:50.000
approximate each of those six
ligands by a point on the

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.000
surface of our sphere.
And then, we are going to say,

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:57.000
if there is a metal at the
center, that cobalt ion in

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:01.000
particular, what is the
probability of finding a d

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:05.000
electron where that ligand atom
is?

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.000
And, in order to do that,
we are going to need to be able

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.000
to evaluate the wave function.
And we are making the

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:14.000
assumption, for simplicity,
that this is a perfect sphere,

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:17.000
and also that our coordination
geometry is a perfect

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.000
octahedron.
And so we are not going to

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:22.000
consider r, because r is going
to be the same everywhere.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.000
It is just a perfect sphere
with one value of r,

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:29.000
no matter which ligand position
we are looking at.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:33.000
And so that means we can focus
in just on these which are the

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.000
angular part of the wave
function for the molecule in

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:39.000
question.
And so let's see what this

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:43.000
means with respect to d z
squared.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:57.000
The probability of finding an
electron at some point in space

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:01.000
in a particular atomic orbital
is proportional to the square of

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:05.000
that atomic orbital at that
point in space.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.000
That is our probability
density.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:10.000
And we encountered that very
early in the semester.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:14.000
Now, we are going to make use
of that to make a plot.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:18.000
We are going to plot this
probability density of finding

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.000
electron in d z squared
as a function of

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:25.000
theta.
Why can I do that ignoring phi?

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:29.000
Well, that is because if you
look at d z squared,

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:33.000
there is no phi in that
equation.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.000
Why is that?
That is because d z squared

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:39.000
is cylindrically
symmetric about z.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.000
And look at how we defined phi.
It is as you go in the

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:45.000
x,y-plane around starting from
x.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:49.000
Because of the sigma symmetry
of d z squared with respect to

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:53.000
z, there is no phi dependence of
this wave function.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:57.000
And that should appear here in
the angular form of the

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:01.000
description of the d z squared
orbital.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:06.000
But we do know that d z squared
does depend on theta,

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:10.000
because theta starts out
somewhere here along,

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:15.000
let's say initially theta
equals zero would be right on

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:19.000
the positive z-axis.
And then, as we keep a constant

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:23.000
r and we sweep down here toward
the x,y-plane,

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:28.000
the d z squared
probability density is dropping

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:32.000
off.
And then at some point,

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:36.000
when we get to the node here,
and we are going to be

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:39.000
interested in that,
it goes to zero,

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:44.000
because that is what happens on
nodes, as we continue down

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:50.000
toward the x,y-plane past that
node, it is going to be nonzero

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:55.000
again and rise up as we approach
this smaller torus in the

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.000
x,y-plane.
Smaller, that is,

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:03.000
than the big lobes that extend
up along z and down along minus

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.000
z.
Let's represent that

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:08.000
graphically.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:20.000
Coming down in theta from theta
equals zero to some value here,

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:26.000
we are going to be interested
in just what that value is.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:32.000
And then, rising up again to
theta is equal to pi over two.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:36.000
Do you see that?
This is another way of

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:43.000
displaying this property.
This is at constant r --

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.000
-- and varying theta.

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:59.000
First of all,
how can we find out at what

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:04.000
value theta goes to zero?
Well, we look up here at the

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:08.000
functional form of the d z
squared.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:12.000
We get nodal properties of d z
squared.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:25.000
We can pretty quickly see that
in each of these,

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:30.000
we have a factor leading out in
front, which is a normalization

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:35.000
factor that assures us that the
sum integrated over all space of

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:39.000
this wave function will come out
to be one.

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:42.000
If there is an electron in that
orbital somewhere,

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:45.000
the probability of finding that
electron somewhere in space will

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.000
be one.
We have these normalizing

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:51.000
constants out in front that
allow for that and ensure that

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:54.000
that is the case.
But where we actually find the

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.000
angular dependence is in that
second term.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:59.000
Here it is three cosine squared
theta minus one.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:14.000
And what we want to do is say,
when does this function go to

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:17.000
zero?
Because when that goes to zero,

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:22.000
we will have this angle here.
If we say, let this equal zero,

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:26.000
we are looking for the value of
the angle theta which

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:32.000
corresponds to the node of the d
z squared orbital.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:35.000
Remember, we mentioned this
last time, because of this

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:39.000
cylindrical symmetry of the d z
squared orbital,

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:44.000
this really is a conical nodal
surface that is above and below

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:47.000
the plane here.
If you are anywhere on that

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:51.000
cone, either in plus or minus z,
the value of that d z squared

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:55.000
orbital is zero.
And so we are setting it equal

00:27:55.000 --> 00:28:02.000
to zero to find the angle theta.
And we can rearrange this and

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:07.000
say that cosine squared theta is
equal to one over three.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:14.000
And, if we go ahead
and solve that,

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:19.000
this comes out to the arccosine
of root three over three.

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:25.000
And the other possibility that

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:31.000
satisfies that relation is pi
minus the arccosine of root

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:37.000
three over three

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:41.000
And so what that means is that
this relation,

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:48.000
here, gives us the angle for
that cone in the plus z axis.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:54.000
And then this one down here,
pi minus arccosine root three

00:28:54.000 --> 00:29:01.000
over three,
gives us the angle for

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:05.000
that cone down in the minus
z-axis.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:09.000
And what is this?
This is, in degrees,

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:14.000
something like 54.476 dot,
dot, dot degrees,

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:18.000
approximately.
That is just how far down you

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:27.000
are from the z-axis when you hit
that nodal surface of z.

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:29.000
And that number,
you are going to see,

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:32.000
is kind of a magical number in
chemistry.

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:37.000
And it will hearken back to
some of the things that we have

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.000
been taking about,
recently.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:44.000
And, in order to get to that
point, I am going to need to now

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:48.000
talk about our ligands again
with respect to d z squared.

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:10.000
We are considering,
now, an octahedral metal

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:11.000
complex.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:24.000
This is the type of
Werner-esque complex that we

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:29.000
talked about last time.
You are going to see that we

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:35.000
are going to have ligands.
We are not really specifying

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:38.000
them.
We are numbering them and

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:43.000
locating them at positions one,
two, three, four,

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:50.000
five, and six relative to our
metal center at the middle.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:54.000
And what you might begin to
realize is that in order to find

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:58.000
out what our energy-level
diagram will be that refers only

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:02.000
to the five d orbitals on the
cobalt center,

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:06.000
or whatever metal center is at
the middle of this ion,

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:10.000
what we are going to have to do
is evaluate the square of the

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:15.000
wave function at each of these
ligand positions.

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:19.000
And we are assuming that all
the ligands are equivalent.

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:25.000
If you think of the ligand as
an electron or as a point charge

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:30.000
in space, then you can imagine
that if we have an electron in d

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:35.000
z squared up here,
that it is going to interact

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:40.000
strongly and very repulsively
with a point charge that would

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:45.000
be located at position one.
Whereas, if we instead had a

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:49.000
point charge located at that
theta angle of 54 point whatever

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:53.000
over there that we solved for,
since that is on the node of d

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:56.000
z squared,
that would be the least

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:00.000
possible repulsive interaction
that you could get between an

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:04.000
electron and an electron in d z
squared because it is

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:07.000
on the node.
And so what we would like to do

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:10.000
is to go ahead and solve for
some of these things.

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:13.000
Essentially,
what we seek --

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:28.000
-- is an energy-level diagram.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:35.000
And so let's write this,
up here.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:39.000
This is five over 16pi.
This is d z squared

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:43.000
that I am writing up.
Three cosine squared theta

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:45.000
minus one.

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:50.000
And because we are talking
about the probability density of

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:54.000
finding an electron at a
particular point in space,

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:58.000
which will mean a particular
theta value in our case for d z

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:02.000
squared,
we are talking about that wave

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:07.000
function squared.
What we need to do is evaluate

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:10.000
it.
We have already evaluated it

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:14.000
where the node is,
but we would like to evaluate

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:18.000
it at position one.
Because we have a ligand at

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:21.000
position one,
and we need to know what the

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:26.000
relative response will be of d z
squared to a ligand

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:32.000
along position one versus the
other five positions.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:35.000
We can say something about that
by symmetry, already.

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:38.000
And so we are going to find out
that the value that you get for

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:42.000
evaluating d z squared
at position one is

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:45.000
the same as you would get for
evaluating it at position six.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:49.000
And that is because the big
lobes of d z squared

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:52.000
are along plus and minus z.
That is where ligands one and

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:54.000
six are.
And then, because the torus is

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:58.000
also cylindrically symmetric,
two, three, four and five have

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:02.000
the same value when you evaluate
d z squared at those

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:06.000
positions.
But that value is smaller than

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:10.000
along z, as illustrated by this
graph over here.

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:14.000
But we just want to know,
how much smaller.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:33.000
And so this is position one.
We get a value of

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:36.000
five-quarters.
And down here,

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:39.000
position two,
a value of five-sixteenths.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:42.000
I am leaving off a factor of
pi.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:45.000
Please don't be concerned by
that.

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:50.000
But these are the relative
values that you get when you

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:54.000
evaluate this function at ligand
positions one and two,

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:59.000
which is all we need to do
because of the symmetry of this

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:05.000
because that value for position
one is also true for position

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:09.000
six.
So we have positions one and

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:12.000
six.
And then, this is also three,

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:17.000
four, and five.
By doing two quick evaluations

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:21.000
at two different theta
positions, position one,

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:25.000
of course, theta is equal to
zero, up here.

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:32.000
And we evaluate that squared
function for theta equals zero.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:36.000
And we get five-fourths pi,
but I am leaving off the pi.

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.000
And down here,
at position two,

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:42.000
we evaluate this for theta
equals pi over two because two,

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:45.000
three, four,
and five are all in the

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:49.000
x,y-plane at 90 degrees to z.
So the value of theta anywhere

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:53.000
for those four ligands would be
pi over two.

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:57.000
You evaluate this function for
pi over two, and you will get

00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:04.000
five-sixteenths pi.
And I have just left off the

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.000
pi.
That is useful.

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:12.000
Let's take this one up to the
top.

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:27.000
Here we have done one of the d
orbitals.

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:35.000
This is d z squared
for all six ligand positions.

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:49.000
Now, let's do d x squared minus
y squared for

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:54.000
all six ligand positions.

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:00.000
First of all,
d x squared minus y squared

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:05.000
has a pretty
interesting relationship with

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:09.000
ligands one and six.
What is that relationship?

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:19.000
Zero.
Because x squared minus y

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:23.000
squared has two
nodal surfaces that intersect

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:26.000
along the z-axis.
And so those ligands,

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:30.000
four and six,
lie on a nodal surface.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:35.000
And so, we know that that is
going to be equal to zero.

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:38.000
If, however,
we go ahead and evaluate the

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:44.000
square of d x squared minus y
squared, let me just write it

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.000
up.
And I have to switch it,

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:49.000
since they are wrong in the
book.

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:55.000
15 over 16pi square root sine
squared theta cosine two phi.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.000
We have that.
Now, just as we do,

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:07.000
we are converting an orbital
angular property into a

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.000
probability density by squaring
it.

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:13.000
This is what we normally do.
When you see pictures of

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:18.000
orbitals, they are representing
the square of the wave function

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:21.000
in space.
We need to evaluate this as a

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:26.000
function of theta and phi in
order to find out what --

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:28.000
The first two,
one and six,

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:31.000
we did by inspection,
but what about positions two,

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:33.000
three, four,
and five?

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:37.000
In the case of those four,
you can see that where they lie

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:42.000
in the x,y-plane with respect to
the x squared minus y squared

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:46.000
orbital is all
identical to each other by

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:49.000
symmetry.
Because x squared minus y

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:53.000
squared has lobes that extend
along x and plus x and y and

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:56.000
minus y.
And that is where all these

00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:59.000
ligands lie, at positions two,
three, four,

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:06.000
and five.
We know that theta is equal to

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:11.000
what?
It is going to be pi over two.

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:17.000
And phi, of course,
can be zero pi over two pi,

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:24.000
and three pi over two for any
of those positions.

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:32.000
And what we will find is that
this evaluates --

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:37.000
For any of those,
let's just use phi equals zero.

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:43.000
This evaluates as 15 over 16pi.
And I am dropping the pi.

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:49.000
Now we have d z squared
and d x squared minus

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:54.000
y squared
evaluated for all six ligand

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:59.000
positions.
And then, let's make a table of

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:01.000
this.

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:27.000
z squared.
x squared minus y squared.

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:29.000
Let's do xz,

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:32.000
yz, and xy.
And here are our ligand

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:35.000
positions.
And in the table here,

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:41.000
we are going to put what these
relative evaluated squared wave

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:45.000
functions are.
And the biggest one of all is

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:51.000
this one here that we got at
position one for d z squared,

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:56.000
which is
five-fourths.

00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:00.000
I am going to divide everybody
through by five-fourths,

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:03.000
so that I can make our biggest
value equal to one for

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:07.000
simplicity here.
And then, when we do that,

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:11.000
you are going to see that two
gives a value of a quarter.

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:14.000
That is position two,
down in the torus.

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:18.000
Three, down in the torus,
is one-quarter relative to that

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:20.000
one.
Four is one-quarter.

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:23.000
Five is one-quarter.
And six, down in minus z,

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:26.000
is one.
So we have evaluated the d z

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:30.000
squared orbital
squared at the ligand positions

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:35.000
one through six.
And these are the relative

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:40.000
values that we got for the
probability of finding an

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:46.000
electron at that point in space,
given a constant value of r.

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:51.000
And x squared minus y squared,

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:56.000
we got for positions one and
six zero, we just said that.

00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:02.000
And then, on the same scale
here, we get three-quarter,

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:04.000
three-quarter,
three-quarter,

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:09.000
and three-quarter.
And then for xz,

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:15.000
yz, and xy, we have gone
through these two steps to do z

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:21.000
squared and x squared
minus y squared explicitly.

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:25.000
Now, we have to look at where

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:31.000
ligands one through six are
relative to the nodes of xz or

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:37.000
yz and xy.
And what we will find is that,

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:44.000
in each case,
these ligands lie on nodal

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:48.000
surfaces of xz,
yz, and xy.

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:53.000
This is zero,
zero, zero, zero,

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:57.000
zero, zero, zero,
and so on.

00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:01.000
Okay?
All the ligands,

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:04.000
one through six,
lie on nodal planes of xz,

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:06.000
yz, and xy.
Only four of the ligands

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:10.000
interact with x squared minus y
squared,

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:14.000
ligands two through five,
because those are the ones that

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:17.000
lie in the x,y-plane.
And they interact strongly,

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:20.000
this relative value of
three-quarters,

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:25.000
but not as strongly as the two
ligands in positions one and six

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:30.000
interact with the big lobes of d
z squared.

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:32.000
And then, also,
ligands two through five,

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:36.000
which lie in the x,y-plane,
interact with the torus of d z

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:40.000
squared,
but to a much smaller extent

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:44.000
because the torus does not have
as great a radial extent.

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:48.000
And these ligands are all at
the same radius out from the

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:51.000
metal center.
And so what this corresponds to

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:54.000
is now an energy-level diagram
as follows.

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:58.000
And this is for an octahedral
complex, --

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:07.000
-- where we have relative
energy units of zero,

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:11.000
one, two, and three.
And what we have to do is say

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:17.000
that the amount an electron in d
z squared would be

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:22.000
repelled simultaneously by
electrons in positions one

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:27.000
through six would be the sum of
these values.

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:31.000
And so we add that up and get,
in fact for d z squared,

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:34.000
up here,
a three.

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:38.000
And, interestingly,
for d x squared minus y

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:42.000
squared,
if we take a sum of the four

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:46.000
interactions that we found that
are non-zero,

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:50.000
we also get a three for d x
squared minus y squared.

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:55.000
So then the net of all their
interactions is the same for x

00:44:55.000 --> 00:45:00.000
squared minus y squared and z
squared.

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:03.000
And then down here,
we found that these three

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:07.000
orbitals, xz,
yz, and xy, where the ligands

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:11.000
at positions one through six lie
on their nodal surfaces,

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:14.000
lie right on their nodal
surfaces.

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:17.000
And so the number evaluates to
zero.

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:22.000
And so a wave function squared
will evaluate to zero any time

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:26.000
you are looking at a position
that is on one of its nodal

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:29.000
surfaces.
It evaluates to zero.

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:34.000
And so we have d(xz),
d(yz), and d(xy).

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:39.000
And then, a diagram like this,
which is a d-orbital splitting

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:40.000
diagram --

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:56.000
-- is associated with a couple
of different parameters.

00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:00.000
One is, down here we have a
triply degenerate energy level.

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:04.000
Previously, we had only seen
doubly degenerate energy levels.

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:08.000
Now we have a triply degenerate
on composed of xz,

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:11.000
yz, and xy.
And that level we are going to

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:14.000
be calling t(2g).
And then, up here,

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:19.000
we have a doubly degenerate
level that will get the label

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:22.000
e(g).
And then, whatever the value of

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:25.000
the splitting of these two
energy levels,

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:29.000
one triply and one doubly
degenerate, we are going to give

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:34.000
that the label delta O for
octahedral.

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:38.000
And at the beginning of next
hour, I will say more about

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:42.000
tables like this.
And I will show you how you can

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:46.000
actually figure out d-orbital
splitting diagrams for other

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:51.000
coordination geometries and how
they compare for a couple of the

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:54.000
most popular coordination
geometries.

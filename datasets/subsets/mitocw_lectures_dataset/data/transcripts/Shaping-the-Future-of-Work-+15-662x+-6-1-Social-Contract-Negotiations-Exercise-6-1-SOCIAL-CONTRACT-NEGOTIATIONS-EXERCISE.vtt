WEBVTT

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.100
Welcome.

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:21.950
You are about to do
something very special, which

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:25.020
is to negotiate
the future of work.

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:27.880
This video is
designed to help you

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.330
know what you need
to know to navigate

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.610
the software and the
tools and methods

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.460
to help you be successful
in this process.

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.010
What you see on the screen
are a series of slides.

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.580
We'll spend more time with
some, less with others.

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.530
All of them will be available
to you on the course website.

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.580
Here's what you need to
know at the beginning.

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:52.110
Once you agree to be part
of this negotiations,

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.920
we want you to sign up
and we want you to commit.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.210
Because in the
negotiations there

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.620
will be yourself and
three or four other people

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.510
in appropriate roles, and
they'll all be depending on you

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:06.670
to stay through to agreement.

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.630
And, frankly, that's
how you'll all learn.

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:10.690
What are the roles?

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:13.650
The roles in the negotiation
match key stakeholders

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:14.680
in society.

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.500
Labor, management,
government, and education.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.420
And essentially, each of you
will be taking on one of these

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.230
roles-- they'll be assigned
through the course platform--

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:26.920
and that will tell
you who you're

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.190
going to represent in figuring
out the future of work.

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.350
Now, once you're
assigned to your role,

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.890
you'll come to the website
platform for this negotiation.

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.830
That's what you see
on the screen here.

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.300
It, again, reiterates what
are the different roles

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.060
in the exercise and
gives you some background

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.410
about the assignment.

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:48.640
And then for all
four of the roles--

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.750
there's two here and two more--

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.790
you'll see some
additional information

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.060
to help you know
what you need to know

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.524
to be effective in your role.

00:01:58.524 --> 00:01:59.940
You'll see there's
a Next button--

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:01.523
I just checked it--
that will move you

00:02:01.523 --> 00:02:03.250
on to the next
screen, which is where

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.250
you start to fill out some of
the key information we need.

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.229
There's different universities
that are participating in this.

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.030
Check which one
you're coming from.

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.830
You will be assigned
a group number

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.250
which you want to assign.

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.440
And then there's other
demographic information

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.120
that you'll fill
out on education,

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.010
whether you've been a
member of a union, age,

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:23.380
and other factors.

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:28.430
They're all required except the
gender item which is optional.

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.020
But again, once you
finish filling out

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.620
those different items,
you'll click Next

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.180
and you go on to a screen
that now asks you to tell us

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.420
about your preferences
or priorities

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.330
before negotiations begins.

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.090
You'll see that there's
five different issues

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.500
about workforce
capability, all of which

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.660
could be subjects
of negotiation,

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.220
and we want you to rank order
them from your top priority

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.390
to your second, third,
fourth, and fifth.

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:58.400
No ties here.

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.480
You have to pick one,
two, three, four or five

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.510
for each of the five items.

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.500
There's also some questions
about representation,

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.840
about organizational
performance, about compensation

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.420
and rewards and
incentives for managers,

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.660
as well as work family
kinds of issues.

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:21.230
All of these are questions that
indicate your priorities going

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.410
in, and, frankly,
that get you thinking

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.220
about what's at stake as you
think about the future of work.

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.530
Finally, before we go
on to the next screen,

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:31.850
in each of the five
big categories--

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:34.080
each of which had
five sub questions--

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.190
we want you to rank
order those in terms

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.220
of what's important in the
role that you're playing.

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.220
And again, you'll press Next
and go on to the next screen.

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.540
Here there's a couple of
short attitude questions

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.910
about cooperation
and competition.

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:52.450
Again, these will be quick and
they give us your attitudes

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:55.560
before we begin the bargaining.

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:56.660
That's the setup.

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:58.650
Now we're getting
ready to bargain.

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.100
You'll see that there's
a slide that tells you

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:03.930
and a set of materials
about preparation.

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:05.970
The key thing about
preparation is

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:09.440
to not just think about your
own priorities, and frankly,

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.910
your underlying interests, but
to think about the priorities

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:13.870
and the interest--

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:15.120
what's really at stake--

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.470
for the people in
the other roles.

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.890
And so the preparation
materials will get you up

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:24.380
to speed on moving
through it quickly.

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.790
But there's a lot here to
read that will help you.

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:30.770
In negotiations, we say
the three things that

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:33.920
are most important are
preparation, preparation

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:34.920
and preparation.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:38.000
Just like in real estate,
location, location,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.740
and location.

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:41.590
This time is time
that's well spent.

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:44.580
At this point now you've
committed to a bargain,

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:47.660
you've got your role, you've
done your preparation,

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:50.340
and we're ready to
begin negotiations.

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.730
I'm going to say a little
bit about the negotiations

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:57.300
and then we're going to talk
about what happens afterwards.

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.310
You'll see that there's a
link to the settlement form--

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:04.710
which I'll show you in a minute,
but there's also, I'm sorry.

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:07.440
There's also a page
that's not on here

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:10.100
but that will come
on your screen that

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:13.720
will let you print out all
of your preparation choices

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:17.070
either in a PDF or
in a printed document

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:19.540
so that you've got
that in front of you.

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:22.040
When it comes to the
actual bargaining,

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:25.230
I'm going to just give
you a very simple example.

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:27.790
Let's say in the
opening statement--

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:30.120
and you'll all make
opening statements--

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:32.190
and this is, of course,
virtual negotiations

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:35.190
so you'll be writing it
out online for the others

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:36.800
in your group to see--

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:40.010
the folks who are in the
worker's role might say,

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:41.430
there ought to be
more government

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:43.120
grants for skills training.

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:46.350
The person in the
government role may say,

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:49.340
we're willing to provide some
funding but only in areas that

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:51.620
are skill shortages in society.

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:54.810
Management might say,
yes, but the grant should

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:57.920
be to the employer since they
know what the skills are not

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:59.600
just to the individuals.

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.930
The education
providers say, this

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:05.220
needs to be part of an
integrated education system

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:09.060
and so these funds for
curriculum development

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:11.500
ought to come to the
educational institutions

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:15.210
so that they can provide the
new training that's needed.

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:17.640
Government may say,
that's all great

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:21.450
but, we need to have
a funding mechanism.

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:24.870
Let's say, $.01 per hour
for people that work.

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:27.530
Management, as you see
here, might say, well,

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:29.270
we're education
providers so we should

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:31.430
be able to get
development funds too.

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:34.760
Ultimately, the management,
the workers, and the education

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:37.520
providers might come
together and say,

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:40.370
we need to provide governance
and insight and input

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:42.340
into this government initiative.

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:46.120
And together they might then
outline what an agreement is.

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:49.800
But as you can see, there's a
series of iterative proposals

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:53.420
and counter proposals that are
all part of the negotiations.

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:56.660
And in the end, we're not
looking for a simple sentence,

00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:59.750
we had an agreement on
government funded education.

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:01.890
We're really looking for
two or three paragraphs

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:04.630
that says who does what,
what are they agreeing to,

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:08.530
how will it be funded, and
what are the outcomes involved.

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:14.310
Now, we've done this many times,
and it turns out this issue--

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:16.350
support for worker training--

00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:18.480
is a common issue
that people pick.

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:23.730
We want you to push the
envelope about what's needed

00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:26.590
in the future of work, so we're
going to say that at least

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:30.480
for your first two agreements
they cannot be agreements that

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:34.180
are on this issue of
government funded education,

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:37.900
but on other issues that are
among the many 25 issues that

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:40.250
we've highlighted
in five categories.

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:42.740
And then if you want
to come back to this

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:44.680
as part of a package, great.

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:48.910
But the point is, push the
envelope, do something new.

00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:50.960
Once you have an
agreement you'll

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:53.060
then follow the URL
to a screen that

00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:54.340
looks like what you see here.

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:56.050
It says it's part two.

00:07:56.050 --> 00:07:59.020
And again, it'll ask you what
group number you're at, what

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:00.750
institution are you doing this.

00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:04.330
And then you'll find that
there's a question about what

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:07.970
role are you in, how many people
are part of this agreement,

00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:10.360
and what were their roles?

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:13.550
So obviously, if you are
an education institution,

00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:16.940
you would check management,
labor, and federal government

00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:19.970
and leave education
blank on question five.

00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:22.460
But at that point you
go to the next screen

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:25.520
and this is your chance to
indicate what you actually

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:26.500
agreed to.

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:30.040
You'll click, let's say,
fair treatment and a screen

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:34.110
will open up saying, write
into this what you agreed upon.

00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:35.789
This is important.

00:08:35.789 --> 00:08:40.049
Each of you will be entering
the agreement separately.

00:08:40.049 --> 00:08:42.140
So if there's four people
in the negotiations,

00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:44.370
there will be four
entries of the text.

00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:46.650
It's perfectly OK
for you to each cut

00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:49.570
and splice the same language.

00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:51.360
But the key thing--
and by the way,

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:53.370
if you put in
different language,

00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:56.470
that's evidence that it might
not be a very stable agreement.

00:08:56.470 --> 00:08:59.910
But the point is, you
each put in your language

00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:04.160
because we also ask you to
each rate how important is this

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:07.590
in terms of your role
and how satisfied are you

00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:09.630
with the process, not
just the substance,

00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:11.100
to get to this agreement.

00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:13.300
And this way we can
hear from each of you

00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:14.477
in the negotiations.

00:09:14.477 --> 00:09:16.060
And of course, there's
a space for you

00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:19.030
to say if there's anything
else that you want to put.

00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:21.450
And that completes the process.

00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:24.600
There's a link here that
will let you come back

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:26.940
and enter a second
or third agreement.

00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:28.750
And when you're done--

00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:31.810
when you're done-- you will
have done something very special

00:09:31.810 --> 00:09:34.270
which is you will have
negotiated an agreement

00:09:34.270 --> 00:09:36.400
about the future of work.

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:40.710
People who are in positions
of power and authority

00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:42.590
are interested to
see what comes out

00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:44.800
of the negotiations
in this course.

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:47.110
We will try to sum
up the agreements

00:09:47.110 --> 00:09:50.360
and look for insights and
lessons around which there

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:52.670
might be the kind of
alignment that could actually

00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:55.780
change things in
society and ensure

00:09:55.780 --> 00:09:59.170
that the institutions of
work are better designed

00:09:59.170 --> 00:10:01.790
to serve the needs of
yourself and others

00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:03.620
in the future generations.

00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:05.880
Thank you very much.

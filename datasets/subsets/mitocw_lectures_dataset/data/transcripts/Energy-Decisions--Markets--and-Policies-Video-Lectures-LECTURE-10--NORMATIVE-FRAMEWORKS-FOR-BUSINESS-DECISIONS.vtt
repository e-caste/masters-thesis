00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:24.530
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Let me do
a little bit of where we've been

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:27.200
and where we're going,
a little wayfinding.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.700
We did the last two--

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:33.080
the last two sessions were on
individuals and households.

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:38.330
We did a rational actor
model, a little drive demand,

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.550
maximized preferences.

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:45.890
And then we talked about
preferences being learned.

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.040
We talked about preferences
depending on others.

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.050
And particularly in
the last session,

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.620
we talked about economic
style, if you will.

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.130
Maximization is only
one form of cognition.

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:00.410
That sometimes we all
behave automatically

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.270
rather than thoughtfully.

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.480
I have a very large book to
read over spring vacation

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.150
by Kahneman called Thinking
Fast and Thinking Slow that's

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:09.140
all about this--

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:10.250
good stuff.

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.520
And Max Weber's distinction
between rational pursuit

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.460
of ends, rational pursuit
of an ideal or value.

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.710
It feels good or we
just do it out of habit.

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.300
So we went from sort
of a rational actor

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.240
story about individuals
and households

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.080
to more complicated
view of behavior.

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.200
We're going to do the
same thing with firms.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.560
So today is about a
rational actor model

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.230
about maximizing
something-- we'll

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:43.800
talk at the outset about what.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.130
And then we'll talk about
behavioral complications.

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.500
Whatever it is we think
firms ought to maximize

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.000
as demanders-- mainly of
energy, that's the focus--

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
before the break.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.880
They don't necessarily
maximize anything.

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.800
First, they're full of people.

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.320
And people don't necessarily
maximize anything.

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.560
And there's an additional
layer of complication,

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.310
which is what we'll
spend most of our time

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.590
on, because people
in organizations

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.680
are more complicated than
people individually because

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.990
of the structures, and
incentives, and relationships,

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.730
and so forth.

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.250
After vacation, we'll
spend a little bit--

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.340
and these are normative
prescriptive sessions--

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.840
on supply-side
strategy, how might one

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.620
do an energy business.

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.280
So that's where we're going.

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.180
It's worth spending
some time, though, on--

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.350
is this reasonably clear?

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.190
Are the questions?

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.180
Let me-- before I pass on--

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.680
OK.

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.530
If households maximize utility,
what should firms maximize?

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.480
If it's your own firm--

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:51.860
my dad ran a garage.

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.380
My dad could do whatever he
wanted-- maximize utility,

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:55.520
maximize profit--

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:56.700
who cares?

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.160
There's nobody to
tell him what to do.

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:02.480
He aimed for profit, actually.

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.140
But for corporations,
it's different

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:14.160
because modern corporations
have diffuse ownership, right?

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.850
The Exxon executives maybe own
a reasonable fraction of Exxon,

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:20.820
but that reasonable
fraction might be 10%.

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.710
Some other companies,
it's higher--

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:24.720
some younger
companies, it's higher.

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:31.950
But in a lot of companies, the
executives are not the owners.

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:38.570
And the question is, what
should the executives maximize--

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:41.030
if they should
maximize anything?

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.040
Milton Friedman
was writing, when

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.200
there were debates about
imposing wage and price

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.920
controls to deal
with what seemed then

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.140
like a lot of inflation--

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:53.450
we had much more later years,
but it seemed like a lot

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:57.410
of inflation in '70, '71, when,
in '71, when Nixon did impose

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:59.350
price controls--

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:01.320
which mostly failed.

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:04.230
And Milton Friedman has
a distinct point of view

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:08.880
about what corporate executives
should be told to maximize.

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.460
Anybody?

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:12.690
Columbus, what do you say?

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:17.022
What does Milton Friedman say
should be the instruction?

00:04:17.022 --> 00:04:17.850
AUDIENCE: Profits.

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:19.017
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Profit.

00:04:19.017 --> 00:04:20.490
OK.

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:24.390
Why not do some social good?

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:28.320
What's the argument against
saying to Exxon, oh, come on,

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.090
you're a big, rich company.

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:32.080
Do some good.

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.390
AUDIENCE: Well, there's
a few different reasons

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:37.110
why, for the stockholders,
they might not

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:47.400
want to do that
for the [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.790
if they do that, they're not
spending their own money.

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:53.790
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Well,
that's disappointing.

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:54.750
You gave a complete answer.

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:56.100
Now who am I going
to call on next?

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:57.720
Does anybody want
to supplement that?

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.220
I mean, that's the basic answer.

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:01.710
It's taxation without
representation.

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:04.080
If the owners want to spend
money on charity, fine.

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.930
But-- and if they want to tell
the executive to do that, fine.

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:13.470
But if they don't, why should
the executives of Exxon

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:15.670
do social good?

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:16.680
So Friedman says, nope.

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:17.850
Their business is to make money.

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:19.380
The owners can
contribute to charity.

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:20.838
We'll start the
debate in a minute,

00:05:20.838 --> 00:05:22.530
but let's clarify
his point of view.

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:23.697
Did you want to add to that?

00:05:23.697 --> 00:05:26.197
AUDIENCE: I just wanted to add
that corporations can get tax

00:05:26.197 --> 00:05:27.820
deductions for
donating to charities,

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:37.200
so it's kind of a way to
pay money to get [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:39.966
charitable, but really,
you're just trying to--

00:05:39.966 --> 00:05:43.160
I mean, you're just paying your
taxes in a different direction.

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.860
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
So you're saying

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:51.020
that a firm can do things
that might not necessarily

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:54.860
look to be profit maximization,
like giving to charity,

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:57.920
but might be thought
through correctly

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:02.030
contribute to their
long-run success.

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:05.560
So you wouldn't necessarily want
to squeeze every nickel out.

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:06.650
OK.

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:08.610
So Friedman would
let you do that.

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:12.940
But Friedman would say, how
do you choose what charity?

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:15.570
Who chooses?

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:16.980
The CEO's favorite charity.

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:19.780
Maybe that's part of
his or her compensation.

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:22.910
Anybody else on Friedman.

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:23.450
OK.

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:24.970
What's handy-- Yeah,
go ahead, Maxwell.

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:25.595
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:06:25.595 --> 00:06:28.850
I was just going to say
[INAUDIBLE] and then you have

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:33.157
[INAUDIBLE]

00:06:33.157 --> 00:06:34.240
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Yeah.

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:37.990
It becomes a political entity,
except that there's no voting.

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:41.560
That it's making
collective decisions

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:44.530
like a taxing authority.

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:47.790
But it's basically taking money
out of the owners' pockets.

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:48.345
David?

00:06:48.345 --> 00:06:49.720
AUDIENCE: So
basically, they just

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:52.390
don't have any right to
choose where to donate to.

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:56.870
And they don't have
that [INAUDIBLE]

00:06:56.870 --> 00:07:01.652
select CEOs that are good
at policy [INAUDIBLE]..

00:07:01.652 --> 00:07:04.110
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Murray
does make an interesting point,

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:10.610
which is that if I give it to
you in the form of dividends,

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:12.470
it gets taxed at
the corporate level

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:14.270
as well as at the
personal level.

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:16.310
Yeah, you can get a tax
deduction personally,

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:18.290
but you get that
corporate tax hit.

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:21.480
So it's a little more efficient
if the corporation contributes.

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:24.550
But who's to let them
decide what to contribute.

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:25.050
OK.

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:25.820
Yes?

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:28.030
AUDIENCE: Also, a corporation's
main responsibility

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:31.310
is just to make a profit for
itself and for shareholders.

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:34.580
And so some corporations have
it in their mission statement

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:38.340
that they do good will and
good work, and stuff like that.

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:41.235
And so then I think it's more
acceptable to have charity

00:07:41.235 --> 00:07:43.610
be part of the company because
it's part of their mission

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:44.160
statement.

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:47.540
But the majority of
corporations, their mission

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:50.000
is to make a profit for
the shareholders, so.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:50.900
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Well, they would usually

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:53.630
have a mission statement that's
a little more exalted than that

00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:55.670
if they have a
mission statement--

00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:58.110
unless they're explicitly
charitable, and some are,

00:07:58.110 --> 00:07:58.610
right?

00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:00.852
There are these corporations--

00:08:00.852 --> 00:08:02.810
which are very interesting--
that treat profits

00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:07.550
as a constraint, not an
objective that are charitable.

00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:10.310
Well, Newman's salad
dressing, for instance.

00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:13.010
They maximize profits
to give to charity.

00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:18.200
There are companies-- what's the
term-- social enterprises that

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:21.080
basically say, we're going
to make just enough money

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:21.928
to survive.

00:08:21.928 --> 00:08:23.970
And we're going to do good
in the following ways.

00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:27.050
You can think about a
number of things like that.

00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:28.430
What's Handy say?

00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:29.390
Handy disagrees.

00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:31.910
Handy's writing-- let me
just see if we've got--

00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:35.530
I think we've got
the main points.

00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:37.240
Yup.

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:40.100
Handy's writing after
the dotcom bust.

00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:42.010
OK, Friedman's
writing in a landscape

00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:46.780
where an issue of the day
is, should the government

00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:49.600
step in and control prices?

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:52.810
Handy's writing after the
dotcom bust when stocks went up,

00:08:52.810 --> 00:08:57.160
stocks came down like a stone,
lots of companies went broke.

00:08:57.160 --> 00:08:59.740
What's Handy say the
firms should be about?

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:12.090
Benzi, you're writing down,
and I'm not saying anything.

00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:16.070
So you must be preparing
your answer to this question.

00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:18.650
So what does Handy
say that the firm

00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:20.608
should the firm should be about?

00:09:20.608 --> 00:09:22.400
AUDIENCE: I didn't get
a chance to read it.

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:22.970
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: OK.

00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:23.580
OK.

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:24.860
Thank you for your honesty.

00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:25.718
Matthew?

00:09:25.718 --> 00:09:27.260
AUDIENCE: I have
the same [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:28.190
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: You
have to same-- somebody

00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:28.790
must have read it.

00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:30.623
I'm sure there's somebody
in this group that

00:09:30.623 --> 00:09:32.780
read the Handy paper--
doesn't summarize easily.

00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:33.740
Veronica?

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:35.230
Fire away.

00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:36.590
AUDIENCE: It wasn't on Stellar.

00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:37.850
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Was
it really not on Stellar?

00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:38.475
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:09:38.475 --> 00:09:42.210
It was only preview.

00:09:42.210 --> 00:09:44.271
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: I got it.

00:09:44.271 --> 00:09:45.990
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:46.990
AUDIENCE: This morning--

00:09:46.990 --> 00:09:49.157
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: No, I
printed it out last week.

00:09:49.157 --> 00:09:51.410
It wasn't up?

00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:53.840
Was it marked staff only?

00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:56.110
Did we screw it up and
mark it staff only?

00:09:56.110 --> 00:09:58.803
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:09:58.803 --> 00:09:59.970
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: No, no.

00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:00.553
It was posted.

00:10:00.553 --> 00:10:02.595
It was posted months ago.

00:10:02.595 --> 00:10:05.220
The only thing I can think of as
it may have been inadvertently

00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:06.840
labeled staff only.

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:10.200
Well, in which case,
because I pulled it off to--

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:13.170
I mean, here it is,
exactly from Stellar.

00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:18.090
So I'll tell you what Handy
says and we can talk about it.

00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:20.400
Handy's a funny article, right?

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:21.508
He's writing in the--

00:10:21.508 --> 00:10:23.550
so you could have just
said, you couldn't get it.

00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:24.967
And then you would
have been good.

00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:32.250
It's a lot of criticism of
the short-term focus in stock

00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:34.500
options and all of that.

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:37.960
He says profits are
a means not an end.

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:41.310
It's a completely
different vision.

00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:44.250
That a good firm is, "a
community with a purpose."

00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:46.200
That's his phrase.

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:49.740
And you should treat
employees like--

00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:51.030
as stakeholders.

00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:54.360
He's one of the coiners of the
stakeholder view of the firm.

00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:57.330
That a firm doesn't exist
to serve just its owners,

00:10:57.330 --> 00:11:00.570
it exists to serve the
communities it operates in.

00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:07.230
It exists to serve its employees
who've invested at least some--

00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:09.330
made some investments
of time and energy

00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:14.550
that will be lost if they leave
the firm or if the firm fails.

00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:18.420
So he would say, a good
firm is about something,

00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:21.270
not just about making
money to shareholders.

00:11:21.270 --> 00:11:25.560
And a good firm will go beyond
minimal legal requirements

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:28.320
for something like things
like environment, and safety,

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:29.598
and so forth.

00:11:29.598 --> 00:11:31.140
So you have two very
different views.

00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:35.070
You have a classical
economic view from Friedman.

00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:36.630
You've been employed
by the owners,

00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:39.780
you have a fiduciary
responsibility for the owners.

00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:42.840
Don't spend the owners'
money without authorization

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:43.870
or instruction.

00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:47.310
And the Handy view that
says, that's too simple.

00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:49.530
Lots of other people have
a stake in the firm--

00:11:49.530 --> 00:11:54.610
the community, the employees,
the environment, et cetera,

00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:56.050
et cetera, et cetera.

00:11:56.050 --> 00:11:58.530
So you really need
to take a broader

00:11:58.530 --> 00:11:59.910
view of what you're about.

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:05.253
Now that you've had a complete
clear exposition of what

00:12:05.253 --> 00:12:07.170
I must say is a little
bit of a murky article,

00:12:07.170 --> 00:12:12.210
we'll make sure you can
get it this afternoon.

00:12:12.210 --> 00:12:13.080
What do you think?

00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:18.050
Where do you come down?

00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:20.650
Sam?

00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:22.750
Handy's view is a little
more humane, isn't it?

00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:23.780
Yeah.

00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:28.170
AUDIENCE: Also, like, we have
the kind of a [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:29.755
their employees
will be more happy.

00:12:29.755 --> 00:12:31.880
And that would just make
it a better place to work,

00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:33.460
which will in turn be--

00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:34.750
make the firm more productive.

00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:36.310
Where if you're
trying to just like

00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:38.757
have like a ruthless,
cost-cutting machine type

00:12:38.757 --> 00:12:40.840
thing, it's going to be a
miserable place to work.

00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:43.762
And it's not going to be just
a flourishing environment.

00:12:43.762 --> 00:12:45.470
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Well, Friedman says,

00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:47.620
OK, I'll take that.

00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:48.460
I love that.

00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:54.520
We will be about
something because that'll

00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:57.430
motivate people--

00:12:57.430 --> 00:12:58.940
that's profit maximization.

00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:01.360
You've just given me
profit maximization.

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:06.210
I've given you--
a great example--

00:13:06.210 --> 00:13:09.860
I'll mention two firms that
I served on the boards of.

00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:12.830
The one was a startup,
became the International

00:13:12.830 --> 00:13:13.880
Securities Exchange.

00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:16.730
It was the first
all-electronic Options Exchange

00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:18.710
in the country.

00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:25.230
And everybody made
money, but the mission--

00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:27.330
not quite chiseled in
stone, but the mission

00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:29.580
that everybody talked
about was, we're

00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:31.320
going to upset this market.

00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:34.890
Trading is slow, commissions
are ridiculously high,

00:13:34.890 --> 00:13:38.010
we could offer a much
better product to the world.

00:13:38.010 --> 00:13:39.570
Well, you can go
to work-- you can

00:13:39.570 --> 00:13:42.100
get up and go to work for that.

00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:44.790
The other is the International
Data Group, which

00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:46.140
has a clear mission statement.

00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:48.960
It's to provide information
about information technology

00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:51.900
so that technology
can have more impact.

00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:54.600
Well, you can kind of go
to work for that, too.

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:58.370
The notion that we exist to
make money for our owners

00:13:58.370 --> 00:14:00.880
a little hard to get up
and get excited about.

00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:03.450
So Friedman said-- Friedman
will come along with you

00:14:03.450 --> 00:14:04.335
and say, yes.

00:14:07.245 --> 00:14:08.370
And there's a nice example.

00:14:11.070 --> 00:14:12.690
Handy mentions Merck.

00:14:15.270 --> 00:14:19.890
Beginning in 1988, they
had invented this drug

00:14:19.890 --> 00:14:21.330
that cures river
blindness, which

00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:25.280
is a very nasty disease that
infects people in Africa.

00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:27.870
I mean, young people go blind
from swimming, basically,

00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:29.580
but getting in the water.

00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:32.970
And the stuff is reasonably
expensive to make.

00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:36.330
They couldn't actually
sell it into Africa.

00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:38.530
So they give it away.

00:14:38.530 --> 00:14:39.280
They give it away.

00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:39.940
It's free.

00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:42.100
They make it available free.

00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:45.370
And you say, how can that
be profit maximizing?

00:14:45.370 --> 00:14:48.280
Well, if you walk into
the Merck headquarters,

00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:53.740
there's a large statue
of a young boy with--

00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:57.130
as I remember it-- somebody
in a white coat with his hand

00:14:57.130 --> 00:14:58.870
on the boy's shoulder.

00:14:58.870 --> 00:15:02.920
And you say to anybody at
Merck, what's that about?

00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:05.770
They tell you this story.

00:15:05.770 --> 00:15:07.390
Well, you can get
up and go to work

00:15:07.390 --> 00:15:09.010
for a company that
says, yeah, we're

00:15:09.010 --> 00:15:10.840
about more than making money.

00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:14.410
We saw something that we could
uniquely do for the world

00:15:14.410 --> 00:15:16.380
and we did it.

00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:18.130
We're not just
about making money.

00:15:18.130 --> 00:15:19.710
So Friedman--
Friedman loves this.

00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:24.190
Anything-- would you go further?

00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:27.800
Julien.

00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:29.180
We've got your name corrected.

00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:30.400
That's fabulous.

00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:32.690
Good.

00:15:32.690 --> 00:15:33.890
Good.

00:15:33.890 --> 00:15:36.260
AUDIENCE: Well, I mean, I
would disagree with Friedman

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:39.140
because he may be
right in some cases

00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:42.650
that perhaps some companies
would find it in their best

00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:46.104
interest to do social good.

00:15:46.104 --> 00:15:49.550
However, let's say-- let's
take a look at McDonald's.

00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:53.210
I'm sure their workers aren't
happy about their wages.

00:15:53.210 --> 00:15:56.150
And I'm pretty sure McDonald's
could pay them a bit more

00:15:56.150 --> 00:16:01.100
But I mean, that might
be seen as a social good

00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:03.540
to earn more than minimum
wage for your workers--

00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:05.360
or pay more than
minimum wage-- and I'm

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:08.930
sure McDonald's could
probably afford it.

00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:14.000
But seeing as they generally
don't pay that much,

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:18.840
it's not really in their
interest for social good.

00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:21.090
So it's generally about
profit, I would say.

00:16:21.090 --> 00:16:25.910
And so Friedman, I would say,
is incorrect in that firms

00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:28.892
don't always do like
social good for profit.

00:16:28.892 --> 00:16:30.350
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Sometimes they

00:16:30.350 --> 00:16:32.180
do social good for social good.

00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:34.310
By the way, I think it's
the local franchisee who

00:16:34.310 --> 00:16:37.460
makes the wage decisions,
and whether that person can

00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:41.400
afford it or not depends.

00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:43.890
AUDIENCE: OK,
different example then.

00:16:43.890 --> 00:16:48.630
Let's say coal mines
back in the day--

00:16:48.630 --> 00:16:51.780
or like during
industrialization,

00:16:51.780 --> 00:16:52.650
clothing factories.

00:16:52.650 --> 00:16:55.765
Like weren't
people-- the labor--

00:16:55.765 --> 00:16:57.390
they were people in
horrible conditions

00:16:57.390 --> 00:16:59.160
and paid them horrible wages--

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:00.827
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
But remember, we're

00:17:00.827 --> 00:17:03.050
talking prescription,
not description.

00:17:03.050 --> 00:17:05.810
Friedman says, that's OK.

00:17:05.810 --> 00:17:08.270
Handy says, that's not OK.

00:17:08.270 --> 00:17:08.990
What do you say?

00:17:08.990 --> 00:17:11.210
You say it's not OK.

00:17:11.210 --> 00:17:12.700
Or do you say it's OK?

00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:16.579
What would you tell
the executives to do?

00:17:16.579 --> 00:17:18.260
AUDIENCE: Better
working conditions.

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:19.609
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: OK.

00:17:19.609 --> 00:17:21.060
Do coal mines ever fail?

00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:23.200
Go out of business, go broke?

00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:24.130
Yeah.

00:17:24.130 --> 00:17:26.723
Even with those lousy
working conditions.

00:17:26.723 --> 00:17:28.265
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
not necessarily

00:17:28.265 --> 00:17:30.540
an effect of the working
conditions [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:30.540 --> 00:17:30.780
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: No, no.

00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:31.350
It's not.

00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:31.850
It's not.

00:17:31.850 --> 00:17:34.320
But if you raise costs,
you raise the probability.

00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:39.810
So here's another
Merck example from--

00:17:39.810 --> 00:17:41.160
that needs a paren--

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:46.080
from 1999 to 2004,
close paren, Merck

00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:47.940
had information about
the adverse health

00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:51.630
effects of a popular drug
prescribed for arthritis.

00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:54.360
A friend of mine
took it regularly.

00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:56.007
And it had very--
it had bad side

00:17:56.007 --> 00:17:57.840
effects they had
information on the bad side

00:17:57.840 --> 00:17:59.580
effects-- they hid it.

00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:00.760
They hid the information.

00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:02.760
And during that period,
they sold a lot of Vioxx

00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:05.050
and made a lot of money.

00:18:05.050 --> 00:18:09.270
Was that profit maximizing?

00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:10.528
Handy would oppose it.

00:18:10.528 --> 00:18:11.570
Would Friedman oppose it?

00:18:14.250 --> 00:18:15.080
Charlotte?

00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:16.708
AUDIENCE: But isn't
that one illegal?

00:18:16.708 --> 00:18:18.000
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Well, yes.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:18.870
There is that.

00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:21.330
AUDIENCE: But are we talking
about things that are illegal?

00:18:21.330 --> 00:18:22.788
Or are we just
talking about things

00:18:22.788 --> 00:18:25.820
that could be or couldn't be,
like depending on the decision

00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:27.960
by the owners, like
the legality of it.

00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:30.502
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: I actually
don't know if it was illegal.

00:18:30.502 --> 00:18:31.620
They certainly were sued.

00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:33.410
I'm not sure of the legality.

00:18:33.410 --> 00:18:35.340
Suppose it was legal.

00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:38.750
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] to meet
their legal requirements.

00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:40.500
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Suppose it was legal.

00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:41.610
Suppose it was legal.

00:18:41.610 --> 00:18:42.330
Bad law.

00:18:42.330 --> 00:18:45.690
The law didn't actually say,
you got to disclose bad effects.

00:18:45.690 --> 00:18:49.740
The law was badly written, and
it let them get away with it.

00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:50.740
Then, should they have--

00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:52.250
AUDIENCE: I think they would
both disagree with that

00:18:52.250 --> 00:18:54.950
because personally, if I
were working for a firm that

00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:58.148
was hiding the adverse effects
of a drug that someone I knew

00:18:58.148 --> 00:19:00.440
might be taking, that wouldn't
be a reason for me to go

00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:01.190
to work every day.

00:19:01.190 --> 00:19:02.857
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
That would be hard.

00:19:02.857 --> 00:19:03.450
Rachel?

00:19:03.450 --> 00:19:04.870
AUDIENCE: I feel like
for in both cases,

00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:06.870
it just kind of depends
for individual companies

00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:09.780
how much they value-- or how
much consumer opinion of them

00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:11.490
matters to their business.

00:19:11.490 --> 00:19:13.370
I mean, this case,
like it might not

00:19:13.370 --> 00:19:15.530
be profit maximizing
if it's really, really

00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:17.860
important that the public
have a good view of them

00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:18.610
in the first case.

00:19:18.610 --> 00:19:20.960
It might be that the amount
of money that they're

00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:24.355
losing by giving
away the drug is

00:19:24.355 --> 00:19:26.480
overcome by the amount of
goodwill they're earning.

00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:28.510
So it just kind of
depends on the firm.

00:19:28.510 --> 00:19:30.190
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Actually,
one thing that's-- it'd be

00:19:30.190 --> 00:19:32.690
interesting to know there, and
I don't know the details, is,

00:19:32.690 --> 00:19:36.430
at what level of the firm was
the decision made to conceal?

00:19:36.430 --> 00:19:39.250
It could be the person
whose bonus depended

00:19:39.250 --> 00:19:41.860
on sales as opposed to the CEO.

00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:42.460
Samantha?

00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:43.970
AUDIENCE: I was
just going to I say

00:19:43.970 --> 00:19:47.660
that I think I'm more on
the Handy side of things,

00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:51.050
that firms have an obligation--
a moral obligation,

00:19:51.050 --> 00:19:54.194
as well as an obligation
to maximize profit.

00:19:54.194 --> 00:19:58.318
And something like hiding
adverse of effects of a drug

00:19:58.318 --> 00:20:01.246
is, in my opinion,
morally wrong.

00:20:01.246 --> 00:20:03.850
And it's not something
that a firm--

00:20:03.850 --> 00:20:06.743
I mean, I would
think that Friedman

00:20:06.743 --> 00:20:09.160
would be OK with something
like that, and Handy would not.

00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:12.980
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
companies do balance like PR

00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:14.950
and public opinion
with them with profit

00:20:14.950 --> 00:20:17.020
maximizing because
public opinion of them

00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:18.800
affects the profits.

00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:20.000
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: And it's
nice to have a mission when

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:21.920
you can have a mission,
but Wednesday, we're

00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:23.837
going to talk about a
firm in upstate New York

00:20:23.837 --> 00:20:25.430
that makes formaldehyde.

00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:27.590
And I just don't know how--

00:20:27.590 --> 00:20:30.010
it may be technically
interesting to run the firm,

00:20:30.010 --> 00:20:31.610
to run the plant,
but I don't see

00:20:31.610 --> 00:20:35.330
how you get socially
charged by that one.

00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:37.100
Just one last,
and than I do want

00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:39.500
to get on to capitol budgeting.

00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:41.540
And let's just
think about this one

00:20:41.540 --> 00:20:46.910
because think about
how much of an issue

00:20:46.910 --> 00:20:50.060
Romney's venture
capital experience--

00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:53.360
actually, a private
equity experience--

00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:58.100
has been in this campaign,
where they closed plants,

00:20:58.100 --> 00:21:00.590
they closed firms.

00:21:00.590 --> 00:21:04.670
And it's portrayed as
the wrong thing to do.

00:21:04.670 --> 00:21:07.280
Sometimes there's no choice.

00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:09.940
Sometimes there is a choice.

00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:11.920
Is there a moral
issue involved here?

00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:13.990
Is there not a moral issue.

00:21:13.990 --> 00:21:15.850
I'm a McDonald's
franchisee, just

00:21:15.850 --> 00:21:19.240
to go to Julien's favorite
dining establishment.

00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:21.520
And I've got six stores--

00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:24.460
and I'm losing money
on one of them.

00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:26.200
Do I have a moral
obligation to keep

00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:30.170
it open because of the
people or can I shut it down?

00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:36.740
Or suppose, in fact, I'm
not losing money on it.

00:21:36.740 --> 00:21:38.840
It's reasonably profitable.

00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:41.720
But I get a really good
offer from somebody who

00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:43.820
wants to make it a parking lot.

00:21:43.820 --> 00:21:46.910
And I can take that money,
open another restaurant

00:21:46.910 --> 00:21:48.650
in a better location
across town,

00:21:48.650 --> 00:21:50.840
where, yeah, I could
employ those people,

00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:53.300
but they won't be
able to get there.

00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:54.200
So I'll take it.

00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:55.185
You had a reaction?

00:21:55.185 --> 00:21:55.810
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:21:55.810 --> 00:21:57.395
I mean, there could
be another company

00:21:57.395 --> 00:22:00.650
that could come in and do more
good to the community than just

00:22:00.650 --> 00:22:02.098
another parking lot.

00:22:02.098 --> 00:22:03.806
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Parking lot-- maybe.

00:22:03.806 --> 00:22:05.174
Maybe.

00:22:05.174 --> 00:22:07.250
Maybe the community is
desperate for parking.

00:22:07.250 --> 00:22:09.680
Let me go to capital
budgeting because I think this

00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:12.560
will take us a little while.

00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:16.790
We're about firms for the
next several sessions.

00:22:16.790 --> 00:22:22.070
And the diagram-- my favorite
diagram that we started with--

00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:25.160
firms supply energy,
supply energy services,

00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:28.520
firms use energy-- that's where
going to focus for a while.

00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:30.980
Firms supply products
that use energy,

00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:35.030
and firms supply products
that help supply energy.

00:22:35.030 --> 00:22:43.520
In all of these cases, the
firms make decisions involving

00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:46.190
costs and benefits phased out--

00:22:46.190 --> 00:22:50.950
spread out over many
years with uncertainty.

00:22:50.950 --> 00:22:56.110
I'm going to assume
some version of Friedman

00:22:56.110 --> 00:23:00.490
because I don't know how to
model Handy, other than as,

00:23:00.490 --> 00:23:03.440
you have to think carefully
about the long term.

00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:05.860
And if I have a
moral obligation,

00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:09.440
I'll add that on top of this.

00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:13.990
So the basic story is we're
going to maximize value.

00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:16.990
That's not maximizing
today's share price.

00:23:16.990 --> 00:23:20.830
There's a nice phrase in
Brealey, Myers, and Allen

00:23:20.830 --> 00:23:24.870
that talks about the
honest share price.

00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:28.730
They don't mean, by that,
in the absence of fraud.

00:23:28.730 --> 00:23:33.330
They mean in the presence
of very good information.

00:23:33.330 --> 00:23:36.440
So you want to maximize how
much the firm is worth--

00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:38.690
if everybody knows as
much as you do and indeed

00:23:38.690 --> 00:23:41.750
knows that much
about other firms.

00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:44.570
So in the case of
Merck you'd want

00:23:44.570 --> 00:23:48.080
to assume they know about Vioxx.

00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:51.650
If I could go to the capital
markets, and I can invest,

00:23:51.650 --> 00:23:53.960
and I can borrow, and
I can raise stock,

00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:56.570
and it's a simple world--

00:23:56.570 --> 00:23:58.160
isn't that a lovely picture--

00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:01.410
the rule to do this
is straightforward.

00:24:01.410 --> 00:24:03.620
Again, we're going to
talk about investments--

00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:07.400
not operating decisions,
but investment decisions.

00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:09.500
You make all
investments that have

00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:12.150
a positive net present value.

00:24:12.150 --> 00:24:18.000
This is net present value in
discrete, not continuous terms.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:21.870
And we do this because
continuous compounding doesn't

00:24:21.870 --> 00:24:23.490
simplify, particularly,
when you've

00:24:23.490 --> 00:24:26.400
got flows that vary over time.

00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:29.070
It's nice in very simple cases.

00:24:29.070 --> 00:24:30.930
I love the elegance,
but if you want

00:24:30.930 --> 00:24:34.260
to work out the net present
value of something like this--

00:24:34.260 --> 00:24:37.680
this is an oil lease,
hypothetically.

00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:40.590
So CAPEX-- Capital
Expenditures--

00:24:40.590 --> 00:24:43.950
are incurred early on,
oil production ramps,

00:24:43.950 --> 00:24:45.990
levels declines.

00:24:45.990 --> 00:24:49.740
And to value this
opportunity, you've

00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:54.210
got to figure, what am I
going to get from selling oil?

00:24:54.210 --> 00:24:55.920
What are the
Operating Expenses--

00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:59.580
OPEX-- associated with
getting that oil out?

00:24:59.580 --> 00:25:02.670
What are the royalties
I'm going to owe?

00:25:02.670 --> 00:25:05.670
And what are the taxes
I'm going to have to pay?

00:25:05.670 --> 00:25:09.650
I take the net
and I discount it.

00:25:09.650 --> 00:25:13.010
And the opportunity
cost of capital--

00:25:13.010 --> 00:25:15.350
we'll spend quite a while on--

00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:17.990
is what I could make
on an investment

00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:20.310
of comparable riskiness.

00:25:20.310 --> 00:25:21.360
What's that mean?

00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:22.870
I'll come back to it.

00:25:22.870 --> 00:25:27.440
But if I can do better investing
in this oil lease, then

00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:30.020
anything else that's handy
that's of comparable riskiness,

00:25:30.020 --> 00:25:33.230
I should make this investment.

00:25:33.230 --> 00:25:34.220
If I can make--

00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:38.840
we'll see next time, the
calculations for Wednesday

00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:42.450
have to do with an investment
in energy conservation.

00:25:42.450 --> 00:25:43.940
So it's the same thing.

00:25:43.940 --> 00:25:46.430
I can invest in lots
of things, but if I

00:25:46.430 --> 00:25:48.450
can invest in
energy conservation,

00:25:48.450 --> 00:25:51.230
and it gives me a better
return than an investment

00:25:51.230 --> 00:25:55.320
of comparable riskiness,
I ought to do it.

00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:59.040
Now that's a pretty
simple formula, right?

00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:02.430
You just did
something that the--

00:26:02.430 --> 00:26:07.230
cash flows that occur in
period J, take a discount rate,

00:26:07.230 --> 00:26:10.230
discount it back to the
present at interest rate R,

00:26:10.230 --> 00:26:13.170
and you do this
on a spreadsheet.

00:26:13.170 --> 00:26:16.320
And you'll see a
spreadsheet Wednesday.

00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:19.570
So a couple simple basics here.

00:26:19.570 --> 00:26:23.680
The first is cash matters.

00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:27.490
Profits don't matter, except
insofar as they affect taxes.

00:26:27.490 --> 00:26:29.740
So this is-- when
you do present value

00:26:29.740 --> 00:26:33.760
for a firm, the question is,
what are my actual returns,

00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:37.540
not what does the accountant
put on the bottom of the paper?

00:26:37.540 --> 00:26:41.010
And the main example
is depreciation.

00:26:41.010 --> 00:26:43.600
Depreciation is
not a cash expense.

00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:45.040
It affects your taxes.

00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:48.430
And you'll see for Wednesday,
you have to consider that.

00:26:48.430 --> 00:26:52.750
But it doesn't directly
impact the cash in the bank.

00:26:52.750 --> 00:26:55.180
It's something the
accountant writes down.

00:26:55.180 --> 00:26:57.790
So you use cash flows--

00:26:57.790 --> 00:27:01.262
relentlessly focus
on cash flows.

00:27:01.262 --> 00:27:02.845
There are a couple
of simple formulas.

00:27:06.670 --> 00:27:09.790
That's the formula for
a perpetuity, something

00:27:09.790 --> 00:27:13.480
that starts with a constant
payment one year out,

00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:14.270
goes forever.

00:27:14.270 --> 00:27:16.720
You'll see it's
the same formulas

00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:19.810
for continuous compounding, but
obviously, the interest rate's

00:27:19.810 --> 00:27:20.470
different.

00:27:20.470 --> 00:27:23.410
This is compounded
once a period.

00:27:23.410 --> 00:27:26.560
And this is nice in
Brealey, Myers, and Allen.

00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:32.020
Suppose you have a bond that
pays c per year for capital T

00:27:32.020 --> 00:27:33.670
years, what's it worth?

00:27:33.670 --> 00:27:36.190
Well, if the interest
rate's R, that's

00:27:36.190 --> 00:27:40.330
equivalent to a perpetuity
starting today--

00:27:40.330 --> 00:27:41.710
starting in one year--

00:27:41.710 --> 00:27:46.900
minus a perpetuity
starting in year T plus 1.

00:27:46.900 --> 00:27:50.598
I subtract that and I get
this simple little formula

00:27:50.598 --> 00:27:51.140
on the right.

00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:56.440
I could also do a T period power
series, but that's cleaner.

00:27:56.440 --> 00:27:58.990
This is the formula you'd use--

00:27:58.990 --> 00:28:02.020
that's the formula
for a mortgage,

00:28:02.020 --> 00:28:04.430
except you use a
monthly interest rate.

00:28:04.430 --> 00:28:07.930
So if you know what the
value of the mortgage

00:28:07.930 --> 00:28:11.590
is and you know the
yield on the mortgage, R,

00:28:11.590 --> 00:28:13.850
you can solve for
the monthly payment.

00:28:13.850 --> 00:28:20.200
That's a standard bond
or mortgage formula.

00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:24.940
The last point I want to
make on this slide is--

00:28:24.940 --> 00:28:26.200
is all this clear?

00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:29.280
Questions, or
comments, or reactions?

00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:29.780
OK.

00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:39.490
Suppose prices are going
up at 10% and the bank is--

00:28:39.490 --> 00:28:41.030
at 10% a year--

00:28:41.030 --> 00:28:44.190
and the bank is
paying 5% a year.

00:28:44.190 --> 00:28:47.790
You're not making money on the
investment in the bank, right?

00:28:47.790 --> 00:28:50.250
You're losing purchasing power.

00:28:50.250 --> 00:28:54.190
The real interest rate,
whatever it is, is negative.

00:28:54.190 --> 00:28:57.000
You put $100 in the bank
today, a year from now,

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:00.540
you get something that's worth
less because of inflation

00:29:00.540 --> 00:29:02.580
than that $100.

00:29:02.580 --> 00:29:06.030
Even though it's $105,
inflation's gone up.

00:29:06.030 --> 00:29:11.160
Well, to figure out the
relation between the market

00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:14.620
or nominal interest rate,
capital R, the inflation rate

00:29:14.620 --> 00:29:20.920
I and the real interest rate,
it's pretty straightforward.

00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:25.920
I put the money in the
bank at 5%, I get $1.05.

00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:29.060
I basically got
to knock that down

00:29:29.060 --> 00:29:32.990
by the amount of
inflation that's occurred.

00:29:32.990 --> 00:29:37.230
And this gives me the
increase in purchasing power.

00:29:37.230 --> 00:29:39.890
So another way to think about
it-- or another example,

00:29:39.890 --> 00:29:44.840
suppose the bank's paying
5%, inflation is 5%.

00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:47.540
I get $105, which
is worth exactly,

00:29:47.540 --> 00:29:51.033
in terms of what I can
buy, what $100 was today.

00:29:51.033 --> 00:29:52.700
So the interest rate--
the real interest

00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:57.770
rate, the increase in the
purchasing power is zero.

00:29:57.770 --> 00:30:00.620
If those two are equal, this
is zero, and that makes sense.

00:30:00.620 --> 00:30:04.220
Inflation has wiped
out the earnings.

00:30:04.220 --> 00:30:07.010
If you just multiply
this through,

00:30:07.010 --> 00:30:09.800
you get this relationship.

00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:15.230
Normally, the product of these
two rates, I and little r,

00:30:15.230 --> 00:30:18.460
is negligible.

00:30:18.460 --> 00:30:22.570
Although, I'm told in periods
of high inflation in Israel,

00:30:22.570 --> 00:30:24.970
people actually do
carry this second term.

00:30:24.970 --> 00:30:26.620
It's normally very small.

00:30:26.620 --> 00:30:29.320
And you get the result
that the real interest

00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:33.490
rate, in any sane circumstance,
is the market interest

00:30:33.490 --> 00:30:36.460
rate minus the inflation rate.

00:30:36.460 --> 00:30:37.030
OK.

00:30:37.030 --> 00:30:40.690
And that's the relationship
every everybody uses.

00:30:40.690 --> 00:30:45.213
It's important to understand
which interest rates

00:30:45.213 --> 00:30:46.630
you're using,
whether you're using

00:30:46.630 --> 00:30:48.670
a real rate or a nominal rate.

00:30:48.670 --> 00:30:51.300
But are we OK on this?

00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:53.850
Everybody nods,
everybody's happy.

00:30:53.850 --> 00:31:00.287
Almost all interest
rates are nominal, right?

00:31:00.287 --> 00:31:02.120
You look up interest
rates in the newspaper,

00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:04.970
they are, here's what
we'll pay you in a year.

00:31:04.970 --> 00:31:10.000
They don't depend on
the rate of inflation.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.670
All else equal,
of course, they're

00:31:12.670 --> 00:31:16.600
going to be higher the higher
inflation is expected to be.

00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:18.910
We had breathtaking
interest rates

00:31:18.910 --> 00:31:22.340
in the late '70s, early '80s
when inflation was running.

00:31:22.340 --> 00:31:26.260
We had mortgage rates of
18%, for heaven's sake.

00:31:26.260 --> 00:31:28.960
If you expect high
inflation, you're

00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:33.530
going to want to get
more dollars back.

00:31:33.530 --> 00:31:36.710
Now you can look at real
interest rates in the past,

00:31:36.710 --> 00:31:37.210
of course.

00:31:37.210 --> 00:31:39.430
You can look at
what was the rate--

00:31:39.430 --> 00:31:43.120
what was the
one-year bond rate--

00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:45.340
on a one-year bond rate,
government bond rate,

00:31:45.340 --> 00:31:49.000
let's say, on January 1, 1956.

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:52.390
What was the inflation
between January of 1956

00:31:52.390 --> 00:31:54.340
and January of 1957?

00:31:54.340 --> 00:31:57.080
I can subtract and get
the real interest rate.

00:31:57.080 --> 00:31:58.960
What do I do going forward?

00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:01.570
Going forward, it's
a little trickier.

00:32:01.570 --> 00:32:04.900
There is a bond sold by the
Treasury-- you can buy them--

00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:08.260
called TIPS, Treasury
Information Protected

00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:09.580
Securities.

00:32:09.580 --> 00:32:13.930
They adjust so they pay
you in real dollars.

00:32:13.930 --> 00:32:17.560
So the interest rate is a real
interest-- interest rate quoted

00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:19.370
is a real interest rate.

00:32:19.370 --> 00:32:24.280
So last Friday-- when I was
able to download Handy--

00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:29.560
last Friday, I checked
the 20-year rate

00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:31.150
on regular government bonds.

00:32:31.150 --> 00:32:34.300
That was 2.83% from
the Treasury's website.

00:32:34.300 --> 00:32:37.975
And the rate on 10-year
TIPS was a half a percent.

00:32:37.975 --> 00:32:40.375
These are breathtaking
numbers, historically.

00:32:40.375 --> 00:32:41.650
It's a half a percent.

00:32:41.650 --> 00:32:46.930
So I'd say the market in
some sense has an inflation

00:32:46.930 --> 00:32:49.000
expectation over 10
years of just a little

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:52.240
over 2%, which is sort
of a reasonable number,

00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:54.930
historically.

00:32:54.930 --> 00:32:57.010
But it's a bit of a
thin market, and TIPS

00:32:57.010 --> 00:33:00.040
have special characteristics,
and not everybody buys them.

00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:04.090
So I wouldn't say you can always
look up the market's inflation

00:33:04.090 --> 00:33:05.860
expectations this way.

00:33:05.860 --> 00:33:07.510
But it gives you a sense.

00:33:07.510 --> 00:33:09.220
It gives you a sense.

00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:12.010
Not a sharp tool, but a tool.

00:33:15.030 --> 00:33:17.960
The biggest mistake
people make in doing

00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:20.840
present value in
almost any setting

00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:24.880
is to confuse which
interest rate they're using.

00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:27.040
Are you using a real
rate or a nominal rate?

00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:32.800
Now the normal thing you do when
you're doing a present value

00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:37.060
calculation, and it involves
so many pounds of cement

00:33:37.060 --> 00:33:40.300
per year over 10 years,
you use today's pound of--

00:33:40.300 --> 00:33:41.860
today's price for cement.

00:33:41.860 --> 00:33:43.630
That's the normal thing to do.

00:33:43.630 --> 00:33:47.170
Today's price for steel,
today's price for whatever,

00:33:47.170 --> 00:33:50.350
figure out physical
quantities, and get cash flows.

00:33:50.350 --> 00:33:53.800
If you do that, you need
to use a real discount

00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:57.210
rate because you've
assumed zero inflation

00:33:57.210 --> 00:33:58.365
by using today's prices.

00:34:01.620 --> 00:34:05.550
If you use a nominal
rate from the market,

00:34:05.550 --> 00:34:07.680
then you need to adjust--

00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:11.250
then you need to
say, well, the rates

00:34:11.250 --> 00:34:16.090
I use are 5%, 10%, whatever they
are, but I expect 2% inflation.

00:34:16.090 --> 00:34:18.230
So I'll build in 2% inflation.

00:34:18.230 --> 00:34:19.980
I mean, you could do
it either way, right?

00:34:19.980 --> 00:34:25.530
You can use today's prices,
take 2% off the market.

00:34:25.530 --> 00:34:28.290
But what you can't do is mix.

00:34:28.290 --> 00:34:32.969
You can't take a rate from the
capital market like that 2.83

00:34:32.969 --> 00:34:37.830
up there, and then
assume price is constant

00:34:37.830 --> 00:34:42.090
because that 2.83 is based
on people's expectation

00:34:42.090 --> 00:34:45.300
that prices will rise--

00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:46.560
that prices will rise.

00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:48.874
So it's a very common mistake.

00:34:52.900 --> 00:34:54.170
Just don't do it.

00:34:54.170 --> 00:34:57.400
And know to look for it
when people show you,

00:34:57.400 --> 00:35:02.020
as they will in later life,
present values because it's

00:35:02.020 --> 00:35:03.940
common, it's easy to make.

00:35:03.940 --> 00:35:08.140
And it can certainly
get you the wrong answer

00:35:08.140 --> 00:35:10.240
if there's any
inflation going on

00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:14.890
or the time period is
of any length at all.

00:35:14.890 --> 00:35:16.270
OK.

00:35:16.270 --> 00:35:20.170
That's issue one,
get the rates right.

00:35:20.170 --> 00:35:23.190
The rates matter.

00:35:23.190 --> 00:35:26.950
Well, let's do this one first.

00:35:26.950 --> 00:35:29.930
The question is, where
does that R come from?

00:35:29.930 --> 00:35:33.250
And I said it's an
opportunity cost of capital.

00:35:33.250 --> 00:35:35.410
It's what you can
get on an investment

00:35:35.410 --> 00:35:36.940
of comparable riskiness.

00:35:36.940 --> 00:35:39.190
Well, if there's no risk--

00:35:39.190 --> 00:35:42.220
even though the US
government was downrated--

00:35:42.220 --> 00:35:47.860
it's normal to treat a
riskless rate as the government

00:35:47.860 --> 00:35:49.720
borrowing rate.

00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:51.940
There's essentially
no risk of repayment

00:35:51.940 --> 00:35:54.500
unless you're a real pessimist.

00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:58.060
And again, you'd use the
US rate, not necessarily

00:35:58.060 --> 00:36:05.270
the Greek rate these
days after the write-off.

00:36:05.270 --> 00:36:09.250
But suppose there is some risk.

00:36:09.250 --> 00:36:12.360
Well, as I say, it's
an opportunity cost.

00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:15.920
So that says you would expect--

00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:18.320
if you're going
to bear more risk,

00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:23.120
your expectation of a return
has to be higher to compensate.

00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:25.670
So you would expect
a higher risk

00:36:25.670 --> 00:36:28.280
means a higher discount rate.

00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:30.600
That sort of makes sense.

00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:32.930
So-- that's cute--

00:36:32.930 --> 00:36:37.430
so you normally discount
the expected cash flows

00:36:37.430 --> 00:36:40.385
at a risk-adjusted
discount rate--

00:36:40.385 --> 00:36:42.260
I'm going to come to,
what do I mean by risk?

00:36:42.260 --> 00:36:45.500
Because that's the
$64,000 question here.

00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:48.530
But so far, I assume
this is fairly intuitive.

00:36:48.530 --> 00:36:51.320
And if a project has some
things that are certain

00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:52.880
and some things
that are uncertain,

00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:56.540
you might want to use
different discount rates.

00:36:56.540 --> 00:37:00.582
If part of the cash flows are
returns on government bonds,

00:37:00.582 --> 00:37:02.540
those are riskless and
I ought to discount them

00:37:02.540 --> 00:37:04.340
using the government bond rate.

00:37:04.340 --> 00:37:09.020
Part of it is sales of Teslas,
I might use a higher discount

00:37:09.020 --> 00:37:14.000
rate for sales of
Teslas, or Chevy Volts ,

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:17.585
or tickets to John Carter,
or almost anything else.

00:37:17.585 --> 00:37:22.180
I'd use a use a higher rate.

00:37:22.180 --> 00:37:25.980
But what do I mean by that?

00:37:25.980 --> 00:37:27.830
How do I think about risk?

00:37:27.830 --> 00:37:29.570
OK, two points to make.

00:37:29.570 --> 00:37:31.115
One, it matters.

00:37:34.590 --> 00:37:36.950
This is not particularly
on point, but I like it.

00:37:36.950 --> 00:37:40.460
It illustrates the importance
of discount rate choices

00:37:40.460 --> 00:37:42.050
you go out in time.

00:37:42.050 --> 00:37:45.800
This equivalent
cash-flow haircut says,

00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:56.870
OK, a dollar in one year
at 7% is worth $0.71.

00:37:56.870 --> 00:37:59.360
At 10%, it's worth $0.62.

00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:04.580
That's equivalent to
taking 13% off, right?

00:38:04.580 --> 00:38:06.890
Raising the discount
rate from 7% to 10%

00:38:06.890 --> 00:38:10.730
is equivalent to a 13% haircut
on what you're going to get.

00:38:10.730 --> 00:38:14.570
And 30 years out,
it's a huge haircut.

00:38:14.570 --> 00:38:18.310
30 years out it, more
than cuts it in half.

00:38:18.310 --> 00:38:21.050
So the discount rate matters.

00:38:21.050 --> 00:38:23.180
The choice-- again,
a nice picture--

00:38:23.180 --> 00:38:29.420
is you've got project A, Project
B. Project B looks very safe,

00:38:29.420 --> 00:38:32.990
project A looks very
risky, but has a higher--

00:38:32.990 --> 00:38:34.950
let's take that to be
the expected value.

00:38:34.950 --> 00:38:38.450
The distribution's
a little asymmetric.

00:38:38.450 --> 00:38:39.560
Which do you choose?

00:38:39.560 --> 00:38:40.400
Which do you choose?

00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:43.020
How do you think about risk?

00:38:43.020 --> 00:38:44.630
Well, it turns out
the right answer

00:38:44.630 --> 00:38:48.640
isn't variance or anything
quite like variance.

00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:54.710
I'm going to walk you
through a bit of finance

00:38:54.710 --> 00:38:57.650
much too quickly.

00:38:57.650 --> 00:39:02.860
So listen for the concepts,
don't listen for the details.

00:39:02.860 --> 00:39:06.570
I just want you to get the basic
notion here, not the mechanics.

00:39:06.570 --> 00:39:08.070
We're not going to
do the mechanics.

00:39:08.070 --> 00:39:10.770
The mechanics will
not be on the quiz.

00:39:10.770 --> 00:39:12.600
But the concept is important.

00:39:12.600 --> 00:39:13.270
Jessica?

00:39:13.270 --> 00:39:14.895
AUDIENCE: Which would
you say is safer?

00:39:14.895 --> 00:39:15.180
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Hmm?

00:39:15.180 --> 00:39:16.800
AUDIENCE: Which one of these
two would you say is safer?

00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:18.620
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: B is safer.

00:39:18.620 --> 00:39:19.120
Sure.

00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:21.250
Much less spread in
the possible outcomes.

00:39:21.250 --> 00:39:23.590
A's got huge spreads in
the possible outcomes.

00:39:23.590 --> 00:39:27.710
And we don't even know where
the zero point is on that graph.

00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:33.000
So just looking at it,
you'd say A is safer.

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:34.860
That says, well, a
nice measure might

00:39:34.860 --> 00:39:39.840
be the dispersion, the
variance, the range, whatever--

00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:40.980
not quite.

00:39:40.980 --> 00:39:43.425
So here's the basic story.

00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:53.540
I can't believe I set this
to fly in, I hate that.

00:39:53.540 --> 00:39:57.070
It's distracting.

00:39:57.070 --> 00:40:04.360
It's easy to show that investors
should always diversify.

00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:06.670
If you read anything
about investment--

00:40:06.670 --> 00:40:09.010
you can make it mathematical,
but if you read anything

00:40:09.010 --> 00:40:14.150
about investment, it says
you should diversify.

00:40:14.150 --> 00:40:14.650
OK.

00:40:14.650 --> 00:40:18.550
This was made very fancy in
the '50s by Harry Markowitz.

00:40:18.550 --> 00:40:21.130
Second step, was Tobin--

00:40:21.130 --> 00:40:23.410
Jim Tobin-- James
Tobin-- let's be fair--

00:40:23.410 --> 00:40:27.370
in the '60s, who said,
well, if you have really

00:40:27.370 --> 00:40:31.000
well-functioning capital
markets that every investor

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:35.620
should hold some of all
risky securities and then

00:40:35.620 --> 00:40:37.250
some safe security.

00:40:37.250 --> 00:40:39.460
So let's suppose I've got
a bunch of risky stocks,

00:40:39.460 --> 00:40:42.530
let's say, and US
government debt.

00:40:42.530 --> 00:40:44.960
Then everybody's portfolio
should be composed

00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:46.610
of some of all the stocks--

00:40:46.610 --> 00:40:49.250
that is, to say the
market portfolio--

00:40:49.250 --> 00:40:51.290
and then some government debt.

00:40:51.290 --> 00:40:53.450
And how much of each
you hold would depend

00:40:53.450 --> 00:40:56.170
on your tolerance for risk.

00:40:56.170 --> 00:40:56.670
All right.

00:40:56.670 --> 00:41:00.750
So that says you want to think
about-- again, everybody's

00:41:00.750 --> 00:41:02.550
efficient, everybody's
optimizing,

00:41:02.550 --> 00:41:06.480
nobody listens to my broker,
everybody's very efficient

00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:11.160
and holds the market
portfolio, right?

00:41:11.160 --> 00:41:12.450
Some shares of each one.

00:41:12.450 --> 00:41:16.440
Now you can sort of do that,
index funds come close.

00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:18.810
But of course, in theory,
the market portfolio

00:41:18.810 --> 00:41:21.060
isn't just the stock market.

00:41:21.060 --> 00:41:24.000
It also would include real
estate, and gold, and anything

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:25.650
else you think of
as an asset you

00:41:25.650 --> 00:41:28.060
might hold in your portfolio.

00:41:28.060 --> 00:41:31.510
But if you think about
rational investors holding

00:41:31.510 --> 00:41:36.190
diversified portfolios, and
the risky part of the portfolio

00:41:36.190 --> 00:41:40.550
having the same
composition for everybody,

00:41:40.550 --> 00:41:45.530
then you would expect--

00:41:45.530 --> 00:41:51.510
again, if you're dividing your
holdings between government

00:41:51.510 --> 00:41:54.870
securities that are riskless,
and a bunch of stocks

00:41:54.870 --> 00:41:58.170
and whatever else
that's risky, the more

00:41:58.170 --> 00:42:02.070
you tilt toward that
risky portfolio,

00:42:02.070 --> 00:42:04.860
you better get a
higher expected return.

00:42:04.860 --> 00:42:07.680
You better have a higher
average expected return

00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:10.660
to compensate for
bearing the risk.

00:42:10.660 --> 00:42:12.690
So this was Sharpe--

00:42:12.690 --> 00:42:15.000
and we'll jump to his answer.

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:18.870
That's just a general
statement of the expectation--

00:42:18.870 --> 00:42:24.790
that the market portfolio,
all the risky stuff,

00:42:24.790 --> 00:42:27.730
should yield a better
return in expectation--

00:42:27.730 --> 00:42:30.220
not every day, as we know.

00:42:30.220 --> 00:42:33.880
But in expectation, it better
do better than government debt

00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:35.710
or why would you ever hold it?

00:42:35.710 --> 00:42:37.350
It's risky?

00:42:37.350 --> 00:42:41.400
So you would expect there
to be a risk premium.

00:42:41.400 --> 00:42:51.030
What this goes to, if you
think about this world in which

00:42:51.030 --> 00:42:55.230
people are holding mixtures of
government securities and lots

00:42:55.230 --> 00:43:01.440
of risky stuff, then
comes another asset.

00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:04.250
Is it risky or not?

00:43:04.250 --> 00:43:05.640
How do I think about its risk?

00:43:05.640 --> 00:43:07.880
Well, I think about its
risk in terms of what

00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:10.230
it does to my portfolio.

00:43:10.230 --> 00:43:12.390
I don't care what
it does by itself.

00:43:12.390 --> 00:43:14.130
I'm holding all
these other assets

00:43:14.130 --> 00:43:16.950
because I'm a rational
diversified investor.

00:43:16.950 --> 00:43:19.440
So what matters
to me if I'm going

00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:23.370
to buy it is, what difference
does it make to my portfolio

00:43:23.370 --> 00:43:26.490
before and after?

00:43:26.490 --> 00:43:30.030
That's not just a
question of variance.

00:43:30.030 --> 00:43:32.790
That's a question
of correlation.

00:43:32.790 --> 00:43:37.950
And the example here is a stock
that moves against everything

00:43:37.950 --> 00:43:44.180
else, even if it moves a lot,
can be a great thing to own.

00:43:44.180 --> 00:43:46.058
Because if I own some
of this and something

00:43:46.058 --> 00:43:47.600
that moves in the
opposite direction,

00:43:47.600 --> 00:43:49.880
I can construct a
risk-free security.

00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:52.720
That's pretty good.

00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:56.350
So it doesn't matter that--

00:43:56.350 --> 00:44:00.580
in this view of the
world, what matters

00:44:00.580 --> 00:44:04.690
is how the returns on an
asset, returns on a security,

00:44:04.690 --> 00:44:08.430
relate to the returns
on everything else.

00:44:08.430 --> 00:44:11.780
Basically, that
two-fund theorem says,

00:44:11.780 --> 00:44:15.380
you're going to hold
something of everything else.

00:44:15.380 --> 00:44:17.990
That's going to be the risky
part of your portfolio.

00:44:17.990 --> 00:44:19.430
That's going to move.

00:44:19.430 --> 00:44:23.180
And if I pick up
another risky asset,

00:44:23.180 --> 00:44:27.080
what matters is, how does
that affect the movement

00:44:27.080 --> 00:44:29.240
of that whole bundle?

00:44:29.240 --> 00:44:32.840
Which says that the
picture I had before--

00:44:32.840 --> 00:44:38.360
this one-- asks
the wrong question.

00:44:38.360 --> 00:44:40.970
That just tells me maybe
something about variance.

00:44:40.970 --> 00:44:42.920
It doesn't tell me
anything about correlation.

00:44:46.790 --> 00:44:51.380
If the world consists
of Apple stock--

00:44:51.380 --> 00:44:56.300
blast-- if the world consists
of US government debt and Apple

00:44:56.300 --> 00:45:01.860
stock, then the question of
whether an oil well is risky

00:45:01.860 --> 00:45:05.310
or not is, does it
move with Apple stock?

00:45:05.310 --> 00:45:07.530
Does it move
against Apple stock?

00:45:07.530 --> 00:45:10.380
If it moves against Apple
stock, I can reduce my risk.

00:45:10.380 --> 00:45:11.880
If it moves with
Apple stock, I'll

00:45:11.880 --> 00:45:17.150
increase it by adding
it to my portfolio.

00:45:17.150 --> 00:45:23.120
So that's the sort
of key insight that--

00:45:23.120 --> 00:45:26.120
now I made a lot-- there are
a lot of assumptions floating

00:45:26.120 --> 00:45:28.790
around here, and I'm
going to relax them orally

00:45:28.790 --> 00:45:29.970
in a little bit.

00:45:29.970 --> 00:45:38.990
I can't relax them
mathematically and get done.

00:45:38.990 --> 00:45:41.480
But the assumption
here is we're dealing

00:45:41.480 --> 00:45:44.900
with a world in which there are
very few transactions costs,

00:45:44.900 --> 00:45:46.850
investors are
behaving rationally,

00:45:46.850 --> 00:45:49.700
everything is smooth, it's
a very competitive world--

00:45:49.700 --> 00:45:53.210
in the financial market.

00:45:53.210 --> 00:45:56.120
That's probably wrong.

00:45:56.120 --> 00:45:59.690
But it's not clear where you
would go from there to a better

00:45:59.690 --> 00:46:00.780
model.

00:46:00.780 --> 00:46:02.632
So let me not defend
this model as truth,

00:46:02.632 --> 00:46:04.340
let me just defend
this model is the best

00:46:04.340 --> 00:46:05.870
one we have at the moment.

00:46:05.870 --> 00:46:08.210
And it says to a
reasonable approximation,

00:46:08.210 --> 00:46:09.980
smart people diversify.

00:46:09.980 --> 00:46:13.370
When smart people diversify,
what matters isn't just,

00:46:13.370 --> 00:46:16.520
does it move, but what
does it move with?

00:46:16.520 --> 00:46:20.530
So the Sharpe model
has this implication--

00:46:20.530 --> 00:46:21.030
oh, sorry.

00:46:21.030 --> 00:46:24.410
I need to go back
to that last point.

00:46:24.410 --> 00:46:31.630
This is a very interesting point
that comes out of this model.

00:46:31.630 --> 00:46:35.260
It says not only do I care--

00:46:35.260 --> 00:46:41.200
if the world is a risk-less
asset and Apple stock,

00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:46.790
comes another investment that
has uncertain returns, if it

00:46:46.790 --> 00:46:49.910
moves with Apple stock, getting
it would increase my risk.

00:46:49.910 --> 00:46:53.240
If it moves against
Apple stock, getting it

00:46:53.240 --> 00:46:54.350
would decrease my risk.

00:46:54.350 --> 00:46:57.200
What if it's uncorrelated?

00:46:57.200 --> 00:46:59.930
What if it's uncorrelated
with the other risk

00:46:59.930 --> 00:47:03.340
in the economy-- in that
case, with the market?

00:47:03.340 --> 00:47:12.110
Well, if it's uncorrelated
and it's on the market,

00:47:12.110 --> 00:47:15.000
everybody holds a
little bit of it,

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:19.302
it doesn't affect the movement
of your portfolio much.

00:47:19.302 --> 00:47:20.760
I'm just going to
have to let you--

00:47:20.760 --> 00:47:22.920
you're going to have to
take that one on faith.

00:47:22.920 --> 00:47:28.900
But risk uncorrelated with the
market can be diversified away.

00:47:28.900 --> 00:47:32.020
It doesn't justify
a risk premium

00:47:32.020 --> 00:47:35.920
in this world, where what
matters is the portfolio.

00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:38.020
Holding it by itself
would be risky.

00:47:38.020 --> 00:47:41.020
Holding a little piece
of it, uncorrelated

00:47:41.020 --> 00:47:46.390
with anything else, turns
out to have effectively

00:47:46.390 --> 00:47:49.640
zero impact on portfolio risk.

00:47:49.640 --> 00:47:51.430
So we talk about risk
that's uncorrelated

00:47:51.430 --> 00:47:54.300
with the market
as diversifiable.

00:47:54.300 --> 00:47:56.310
And it doesn't demand
a risk premium--

00:47:56.310 --> 00:47:57.602
in this world.

00:47:57.602 --> 00:48:00.060
I'll give you a little bit
about another world in a minute.

00:48:00.060 --> 00:48:05.200
But in this world, it doesn't
demand a risk premium.

00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:08.910
So we're flying along--

00:48:08.910 --> 00:48:12.300
concepts, concepts,
portfolio is what matters,

00:48:12.300 --> 00:48:14.190
correlations matter.

00:48:14.190 --> 00:48:21.210
This is Sharpe's
model that, again,

00:48:21.210 --> 00:48:25.020
under reasonable
assumptions widely used,

00:48:25.020 --> 00:48:27.270
if something has a zero--

00:48:27.270 --> 00:48:31.620
it turns out the measure
of risk now is beta.

00:48:31.620 --> 00:48:34.680
The whole market has a
beta of 1 by definition,

00:48:34.680 --> 00:48:38.490
risk-free rate has a beta of
zero because it doesn't move,

00:48:38.490 --> 00:48:40.512
it has no risk.

00:48:40.512 --> 00:48:41.970
Things that move
against the market

00:48:41.970 --> 00:48:47.010
have negative betas, things
that move toward the market--

00:48:47.010 --> 00:48:50.370
with the market depending on the
correlation and the movement,

00:48:50.370 --> 00:48:53.380
will have a positive beta.

00:48:53.380 --> 00:48:56.560
Beta is the measure
of covariance

00:48:56.560 --> 00:49:01.140
is not quite right-- of
covariance with the market.

00:49:01.140 --> 00:49:06.240
And higher beta securities have
a higher required or expected

00:49:06.240 --> 00:49:09.530
return, higher beta assets.

00:49:09.530 --> 00:49:14.660
So an example-- this is
the cost of equity for BP.

00:49:14.660 --> 00:49:15.811
It's an estimate.

00:49:18.400 --> 00:49:23.090
Basically, by definition,
it got identically equal.

00:49:23.090 --> 00:49:27.580
By definition, the beta on
the market as a whole is 1.

00:49:27.580 --> 00:49:30.670
It turns out that BP
and other major oil

00:49:30.670 --> 00:49:35.440
producers are less risky in this
regard than the average stock.

00:49:35.440 --> 00:49:37.930
Beta is 0.8 for BP.

00:49:37.930 --> 00:49:42.190
You can estimate
it, and here would

00:49:42.190 --> 00:49:47.790
be an example of calculating the
required-- or the opportunity

00:49:47.790 --> 00:49:51.540
cost for investments that
look like BP's investments.

00:49:51.540 --> 00:49:56.080
So we look at what the
market requires from BP.

00:49:56.080 --> 00:49:57.330
Well, we know it's beta.

00:49:57.330 --> 00:49:58.950
We can estimate that--

00:49:58.950 --> 00:50:00.840
no point going into it here.

00:50:00.840 --> 00:50:04.750
Suppose the risk
free rate is 3%.

00:50:04.750 --> 00:50:10.960
The market as a whole has
a risk premium of 5.4%--

00:50:10.960 --> 00:50:14.860
that, again, you can calculate--
that gives a cost of equity

00:50:14.860 --> 00:50:15.820
for BP--

00:50:15.820 --> 00:50:19.300
opportunity cost-- of 7.3%.

00:50:19.300 --> 00:50:25.610
That's what investors would
take to own BP stock in terms

00:50:25.610 --> 00:50:28.160
of expected return
or another investment

00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:29.660
of comparable riskiness.

00:50:29.660 --> 00:50:33.140
Comparable riskiness-- beta 0.8.

00:50:33.140 --> 00:50:39.580
So the measure of riskiness
becomes a simple number, beta.

00:50:39.580 --> 00:50:45.380
Now that's-- again,
it's a simple model.

00:50:45.380 --> 00:50:48.620
I'm not expecting you to
understand anything other

00:50:48.620 --> 00:50:50.780
than that beta
involves not variance,

00:50:50.780 --> 00:50:53.660
but covariance and
correlation-- it involves

00:50:53.660 --> 00:50:55.385
comovements with other assets.

00:50:58.520 --> 00:51:01.550
As I say, this is
the opportunity cost

00:51:01.550 --> 00:51:05.510
of investing in
projects is risky as BP.

00:51:05.510 --> 00:51:12.250
So if you-- are
we semi-OK so far?

00:51:14.860 --> 00:51:16.090
The concept here.

00:51:16.090 --> 00:51:19.180
We're in a world where
everybody diversifies,

00:51:19.180 --> 00:51:22.060
everybody diversifies
as much as they can.

00:51:22.060 --> 00:51:23.650
It turns out the
rational way to do

00:51:23.650 --> 00:51:26.350
that is for everybody to
hold the same proportion

00:51:26.350 --> 00:51:28.500
of risky assets.

00:51:28.500 --> 00:51:33.560
So if you have two shares of
Apple and one share of GM,

00:51:33.560 --> 00:51:37.760
I might have four shares of
Apple and two shares of GM.

00:51:37.760 --> 00:51:39.350
But I don't reverse
the proportions

00:51:39.350 --> 00:51:42.650
because we're both owning
pieces of the market

00:51:42.650 --> 00:51:44.480
in the same percentage.

00:51:44.480 --> 00:51:46.340
And in that world,
what matters is

00:51:46.340 --> 00:51:48.770
how things correlate
with the market

00:51:48.770 --> 00:51:51.700
and also how big the moves are.

00:51:51.700 --> 00:51:53.560
And beta captures both of those.

00:51:53.560 --> 00:51:58.510
As that earlier slide says, it
captures both the correlation

00:51:58.510 --> 00:51:59.440
and the volatility.

00:51:59.440 --> 00:52:02.830
It captures the correlation
and the standard deviation

00:52:02.830 --> 00:52:04.670
of its own movements.

00:52:04.670 --> 00:52:09.520
So if we're going
to do discounting,

00:52:09.520 --> 00:52:14.140
figure out what the
cash flows are, probably

00:52:14.140 --> 00:52:15.633
use the expected cash flows.

00:52:15.633 --> 00:52:17.300
We might want to be
conservative and use

00:52:17.300 --> 00:52:21.550
the lower bounds of revenues
and upper bounds of costs,

00:52:21.550 --> 00:52:23.590
or be optimistic.

00:52:23.590 --> 00:52:26.320
Figure out how
risky the thing is--

00:52:26.320 --> 00:52:28.840
and frankly, this is very--

00:52:28.840 --> 00:52:30.400
it's very easy
for common stocks.

00:52:30.400 --> 00:52:33.640
It's a little harder for
an investment project.

00:52:33.640 --> 00:52:38.530
If I say, well, I think this
project has a beta of 0.8,

00:52:38.530 --> 00:52:40.870
how do I get there?

00:52:40.870 --> 00:52:47.080
You could see that the key
thing that people usually

00:52:47.080 --> 00:52:54.870
do-- so this is the split
of a particular project.

00:52:54.870 --> 00:52:58.890
The first thing you ask is, is
the risk diversifiable or not?

00:52:58.890 --> 00:53:01.740
Is it correlated to
a first approximation

00:53:01.740 --> 00:53:05.350
with movements in the rest
of the economy or not?

00:53:05.350 --> 00:53:07.620
So there's some uncertainty.

00:53:07.620 --> 00:53:10.230
We're going to put in--
let's say it's a wind farm.

00:53:10.230 --> 00:53:13.060
We're going to
build a wind farm.

00:53:13.060 --> 00:53:14.830
There is some
uncertainty-- we've

00:53:14.830 --> 00:53:16.870
got the we've got the
equipment under contract.

00:53:16.870 --> 00:53:18.847
There's uncertainty
about how difficult it's

00:53:18.847 --> 00:53:21.430
going to be to put the thing in
place, to do the installation,

00:53:21.430 --> 00:53:23.620
to do the construction.

00:53:23.620 --> 00:53:25.082
That's not going
to be correlated

00:53:25.082 --> 00:53:26.290
with the rest of the economy.

00:53:26.290 --> 00:53:27.610
That's just local.

00:53:27.610 --> 00:53:28.660
That's a local risk.

00:53:28.660 --> 00:53:30.160
That's diversifiable.

00:53:30.160 --> 00:53:32.973
If I can get enough
people to hold that risk,

00:53:32.973 --> 00:53:35.140
it's not going to matter
to anybody because it's not

00:53:35.140 --> 00:53:37.420
going to move their portfolio.

00:53:37.420 --> 00:53:40.660
The wages I have to
pay will be correlated

00:53:40.660 --> 00:53:42.410
with the rest of the economy.

00:53:42.410 --> 00:53:43.990
So if I haven't
fixed wages and I

00:53:43.990 --> 00:53:48.280
haven't fixed prices for
materials, then maybe that does

00:53:48.280 --> 00:53:50.800
need to be discounted
because it is correlated.

00:53:50.800 --> 00:53:53.800
Again, it's diversifiable
versus nondiversifiable.

00:53:53.800 --> 00:53:55.540
Is it correlated
with the market,

00:53:55.540 --> 00:53:57.910
with the rest of the economy?

00:53:57.910 --> 00:54:02.088
Or is it just something random
that's going to happen to me?

00:54:02.088 --> 00:54:03.880
I don't know the wind
conditions very well,

00:54:03.880 --> 00:54:07.150
or the reservoir conditions, or
a variety of things like that.

00:54:07.150 --> 00:54:10.300
Is that going to be correlated
with the rest of the economy?

00:54:10.300 --> 00:54:12.230
Probably not.

00:54:12.230 --> 00:54:14.230
That's probably
diversifiable risk,

00:54:14.230 --> 00:54:15.940
and I shouldn't
worry about the beta

00:54:15.940 --> 00:54:18.070
because it's probably zero.

00:54:18.070 --> 00:54:22.190
It's not correlated
with other things.

00:54:22.190 --> 00:54:25.550
Oh, how much am I going to get
out in terms of kilowatt hours?

00:54:25.550 --> 00:54:26.542
The wind is uncertain.

00:54:26.542 --> 00:54:28.250
I don't know what my
annual production is

00:54:28.250 --> 00:54:29.542
going to be from the wind farm.

00:54:29.542 --> 00:54:34.070
That's probably diversifiable.

00:54:34.070 --> 00:54:37.923
That is to say it, whether
the wind blows or doesn't blow

00:54:37.923 --> 00:54:40.340
isn't going to be correlated
with the rest of the economy,

00:54:40.340 --> 00:54:41.000
probably.

00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:42.860
Unless I have a
long-term contract,

00:54:42.860 --> 00:54:46.970
the price at which I
sell power will for sure

00:54:46.970 --> 00:54:49.900
be correlated with
everything else.

00:54:49.900 --> 00:54:53.120
That's not diversifiable, right?

00:54:53.120 --> 00:54:55.130
The market moves up,
the economy moves up,

00:54:55.130 --> 00:54:58.490
the wholesale price of
electricity goes up.

00:54:58.490 --> 00:55:01.900
So that's going to have
a significant beta.

00:55:01.900 --> 00:55:04.330
This other stuff,
not so much, so I'm

00:55:04.330 --> 00:55:07.950
not going to worry too
much about the risk.

00:55:07.950 --> 00:55:12.980
So I would treat
the two differently.

00:55:12.980 --> 00:55:14.000
OK so far?

00:55:18.740 --> 00:55:25.850
Now-- let's do
slightly different.

00:55:25.850 --> 00:55:28.480
There are different degrees
when you're doing this exercise.

00:55:28.480 --> 00:55:31.810
We will see a cost-saving
project on Wednesday.

00:55:31.810 --> 00:55:35.550
We'll do the spreadsheet.

00:55:35.550 --> 00:55:37.420
We won't come back
to beta again,

00:55:37.420 --> 00:55:40.830
but you need to
see it and hear it.

00:55:40.830 --> 00:55:44.160
We come back for
a while, at least.

00:55:44.160 --> 00:55:48.480
That exercise, you
will see it's done

00:55:48.480 --> 00:55:52.830
assuming there's a certain
level of activity in the plant.

00:55:52.830 --> 00:55:56.490
Well, how else are you
going to do it, really?

00:55:56.490 --> 00:55:58.888
You could simulate other
levels of activity,

00:55:58.888 --> 00:56:00.930
but it's done in a pretty
straightforward, pretty

00:56:00.930 --> 00:56:01.740
standard fashion.

00:56:04.950 --> 00:56:06.810
If you have the
wind farm and you've

00:56:06.810 --> 00:56:13.436
presold the power, then,
again, the revenue--

00:56:13.436 --> 00:56:16.400
revenue's fixed.

00:56:16.400 --> 00:56:20.230
You don't need to discount
the revenue to allow for risk.

00:56:20.230 --> 00:56:24.620
And the cost risks are probably
diversifiable per the example

00:56:24.620 --> 00:56:25.120
I said.

00:56:25.120 --> 00:56:28.720
And you probably don't
want to treat costs

00:56:28.720 --> 00:56:30.100
as a high beta item.

00:56:33.080 --> 00:56:35.222
Suppose you don't
know the revenues.

00:56:35.222 --> 00:56:37.430
Suppose you're going to
build a gas-fired power plant

00:56:37.430 --> 00:56:39.305
and you're going to sell
into the New England

00:56:39.305 --> 00:56:41.060
wholesale market.

00:56:41.060 --> 00:56:44.593
Oh, well, now your
revenues are definitely

00:56:44.593 --> 00:56:46.260
correlated with the
rest of the economy.

00:56:46.260 --> 00:56:48.052
Your revenues will have
a significant beta.

00:56:51.450 --> 00:56:54.760
Now suppose you're
developing a new widget.

00:56:54.760 --> 00:57:00.746
Well, the game changes
now completely, right?

00:57:00.746 --> 00:57:06.630
It's a new toy, it's a new video
game, it is whatever it is.

00:57:06.630 --> 00:57:10.020
You worry much less-- and we'll
get to this after vacation--

00:57:10.020 --> 00:57:12.540
you worry much
less about the beta

00:57:12.540 --> 00:57:15.060
on the revenue from
your video game

00:57:15.060 --> 00:57:18.300
than on whether you're actually
making something worth selling,

00:57:18.300 --> 00:57:23.070
and can you retain the value?

00:57:23.070 --> 00:57:27.060
Lots of great ideas do
not enrich their owners.

00:57:27.060 --> 00:57:30.328
The person who invented the--

00:57:30.328 --> 00:57:31.620
I always pronounce it "kor-ig".

00:57:31.620 --> 00:57:32.730
It's pronounced
something differently.

00:57:32.730 --> 00:57:34.560
The little thing
that you use to make

00:57:34.560 --> 00:57:37.530
bad coffee with the capsules--

00:57:37.530 --> 00:57:40.310
made essentially nothing.

00:57:40.310 --> 00:57:45.160
So created value,
didn't capture value.

00:57:45.160 --> 00:57:47.440
Then all of this
stuff about beta,

00:57:47.440 --> 00:57:50.230
and discounting, and so
on, takes a back seat

00:57:50.230 --> 00:57:53.920
to strategic
considerations about, well,

00:57:53.920 --> 00:57:55.690
how to do I ensure I--

00:57:55.690 --> 00:57:57.100
how do I ensure
I sell something?

00:57:57.100 --> 00:57:58.970
How do I ensure I capture value?

00:57:58.970 --> 00:58:01.910
How do I ensure that my
strategy makes sense?

00:58:01.910 --> 00:58:05.770
And finally, suppose you're
a small business with limited

00:58:05.770 --> 00:58:06.850
capital market access.

00:58:06.850 --> 00:58:09.790
You can't do this borrowing,
and lending, and raising money,

00:58:09.790 --> 00:58:12.180
and alternative investments.

00:58:12.180 --> 00:58:13.780
Do you know that first acronym?

00:58:13.780 --> 00:58:16.680
Has anybody ever heard it?

00:58:16.680 --> 00:58:19.500
This used to be the
mantra of the former head

00:58:19.500 --> 00:58:21.660
of the Entrepreneurship
Center here.

00:58:21.660 --> 00:58:25.110
And it's short for Cash Is More
Important Than Your Mother.

00:58:28.890 --> 00:58:35.520
Which, for small businesses,
is often true, right?

00:58:35.520 --> 00:58:37.890
We didn't talk about cash
constraints in all this.

00:58:37.890 --> 00:58:40.270
We didn't talk about project
size in any of this stuff

00:58:40.270 --> 00:58:40.770
I did.

00:58:40.770 --> 00:58:43.710
Take positive net present
value projects, it's all swell.

00:58:43.710 --> 00:58:49.170
Well, that assumes you can
basically diversify risk.

00:58:49.170 --> 00:58:51.420
It assumes you have
access to the market.

00:58:51.420 --> 00:58:53.370
It assumes you can
borrow and lend.

00:58:53.370 --> 00:58:57.090
It assumes if you have a
bad day, you can get a loan.

00:58:57.090 --> 00:59:03.420
It assumes diversifiable zero
beta risks don't matter really.

00:59:03.420 --> 00:59:07.530
If you're a small business,
however, a zero beta risk

00:59:07.530 --> 00:59:09.720
can kill you, right?

00:59:09.720 --> 00:59:13.740
I mean, you're
building this plant.

00:59:13.740 --> 00:59:15.192
The construction is uncertain.

00:59:15.192 --> 00:59:17.400
You don't know whether you're
going to get it online.

00:59:17.400 --> 00:59:19.442
That's uncorrelated with
the rest of the economy.

00:59:19.442 --> 00:59:22.240
But if it fails, you're done.

00:59:22.240 --> 00:59:29.020
So for small businesses with
limited capital market access,

00:59:29.020 --> 00:59:32.080
all of this beta
stuff is lovely.

00:59:32.080 --> 00:59:34.570
Large corporations do it,
lots of companies do it,

00:59:34.570 --> 00:59:36.580
consultants do it.

00:59:36.580 --> 00:59:38.770
It's a lot of fun.

00:59:38.770 --> 00:59:40.713
If you're a small
business, however, cash

00:59:40.713 --> 00:59:42.130
is more important--
well, not more

00:59:42.130 --> 00:59:45.160
important than your mother,
but it's very important.

00:59:45.160 --> 00:59:50.260
And worrying about running
out of it will dominate.

00:59:50.260 --> 00:59:52.330
And to say to a
small business owner,

00:59:52.330 --> 00:59:56.770
well, it's true that you go
broke if this thing fails,

00:59:56.770 --> 00:59:58.870
but that's a zero beta risk.

00:59:58.870 --> 01:00:01.240
It's not correlated with
the rest of the economy.

01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:03.340
You shouldn't treat it as risky.

01:00:03.340 --> 01:00:04.990
That's nuts, right?

01:00:04.990 --> 01:00:10.630
So the story about beta and
the appropriate measure of risk

01:00:10.630 --> 01:00:14.215
for which we have good
theory applies to large--

01:00:14.215 --> 01:00:16.540
it applies to ventures
with capital market access,

01:00:16.540 --> 01:00:18.820
large or small.

01:00:18.820 --> 01:00:21.550
How you think about risk
for a small business

01:00:21.550 --> 01:00:24.040
with limited or no
capital market access

01:00:24.040 --> 01:00:26.260
really depends on the
exact circumstances

01:00:26.260 --> 01:00:28.320
of the small business.

01:00:28.320 --> 01:00:32.580
If you've raised $1,000
from venture capital

01:00:32.580 --> 01:00:35.700
and you think it's
going to take you

01:00:35.700 --> 01:00:39.450
$900 to bring the
thing to market,

01:00:39.450 --> 01:00:42.960
you better get it to
market for $900 or you

01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:47.040
either go broke or give away
a large part of your ownership

01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:49.320
to raise additional money.

01:00:49.320 --> 01:00:50.910
So I just want--

01:00:50.910 --> 01:00:54.360
I don't want anybody dealing
with a small business

01:00:54.360 --> 01:00:56.280
to say, yes, but
what really matters

01:00:56.280 --> 01:00:58.800
is diversifiable and
not diversifiable risk.

01:00:58.800 --> 01:01:01.110
It does for a big company,
it does for a company

01:01:01.110 --> 01:01:03.270
with capital market access.

01:01:03.270 --> 01:01:04.920
It's not the dominant
consideration

01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:05.980
for a small business.

01:01:05.980 --> 01:01:09.210
And it's not the
dominant consideration

01:01:09.210 --> 01:01:14.190
in evaluating a project
that really is innovative

01:01:14.190 --> 01:01:17.760
because there the real question
is, can I capture value?

01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:20.640
And that's a
post-vacation question.

01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:23.070
So I'll take questions.

01:01:23.070 --> 01:01:27.960
Let me say a little
bit about Wednesday.

01:01:27.960 --> 01:01:29.110
Wednesday's a case.

01:01:29.110 --> 01:01:32.680
We're going to spend almost
all the time on the case.

01:01:32.680 --> 01:01:37.550
I hope you can get the
spreadsheet down from Stellar.

01:01:37.550 --> 01:01:41.050
It involves an actual decision--

01:01:41.050 --> 01:01:46.050
an engineer, a plant manager,
finds a solution that

01:01:46.050 --> 01:01:48.060
will save energy, he thinks.

01:01:48.060 --> 01:01:49.950
Well, solution will save
energy, the question

01:01:49.950 --> 01:01:51.960
is, is it a good investment?

01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:57.810
You will see a spreadsheet that
lays out a net present value

01:01:57.810 --> 01:01:59.160
analysis.

01:01:59.160 --> 01:02:01.800
I invite you to look
at that spreadsheet,

01:02:01.800 --> 01:02:04.290
look closely at the formulas.

01:02:04.290 --> 01:02:05.550
Is it right?

01:02:05.550 --> 01:02:06.990
Is the analysis right?

01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:13.668
Then the question is--

01:02:13.668 --> 01:02:19.260
you will also see in the
case a bunch of objections.

01:02:19.260 --> 01:02:23.160
I think the spreadsheet
has mistakes.

01:02:23.160 --> 01:02:26.220
I think the
spreadsheet fixed shows

01:02:26.220 --> 01:02:29.400
it to be a positive net
present value investment.

01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:31.870
You will also see in the case--

01:02:31.870 --> 01:02:35.040
so it's all the
stuff we all like.

01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:38.500
It's an investment
that will save energy,

01:02:38.500 --> 01:02:40.990
no animals will be harmed.

01:02:40.990 --> 01:02:43.570
They won't be venting
steam into the environment.

01:02:43.570 --> 01:02:45.580
They won't have
an icing problem.

01:02:45.580 --> 01:02:47.140
Life will be good.

01:02:47.140 --> 01:02:49.360
But there are a long
list of objectors--

01:02:49.360 --> 01:02:51.280
a long list of
objections, and probably

01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:55.180
a long list of objectors, also.

01:02:55.180 --> 01:03:02.110
And read that and answer the
question, given those concerns,

01:03:02.110 --> 01:03:03.670
what's he do?

01:03:03.670 --> 01:03:05.350
Here's a positive
net present value

01:03:05.350 --> 01:03:06.847
investment in all probability.

01:03:06.847 --> 01:03:08.680
Again, we'll go through
the spreadsheet just

01:03:08.680 --> 01:03:10.600
to see how it's done.

01:03:10.600 --> 01:03:12.370
It's a positive
net present value

01:03:12.370 --> 01:03:14.200
investment that
will save energy,

01:03:14.200 --> 01:03:16.300
be good for the environment--

01:03:16.300 --> 01:03:21.090
more ducks, whatever-- but
he may not get to do it.

01:03:21.090 --> 01:03:23.310
He may not-- and
not because they

01:03:23.310 --> 01:03:26.100
don't have any capital in the
bank, any cash in the bank.

01:03:26.100 --> 01:03:27.940
He may not get to do it.

01:03:27.940 --> 01:03:31.590
So think about
what he should say.

01:03:31.590 --> 01:03:37.620
And think about how the
firm from the top management

01:03:37.620 --> 01:03:41.130
might want to structure
things so that projects

01:03:41.130 --> 01:03:43.200
like that don't get blocked.

01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:44.190
So take a look at that.

01:03:44.190 --> 01:03:46.440
And let me take questions
for a few minutes.

01:03:46.440 --> 01:03:49.260
And again, I'll let you
go-- let you go early.

01:03:49.260 --> 01:03:50.070
Yes?

01:03:50.070 --> 01:03:50.695
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:03:50.695 --> 01:03:52.290
Related to this,
when people talk

01:03:52.290 --> 01:03:55.540
about having compensation
for executives

01:03:55.540 --> 01:04:01.200
and people on the board be based
on like a risk-adjusted income?

01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:04.945
Would that be based on
nondiversifiable risk as well,

01:04:04.945 --> 01:04:05.445
or?

01:04:07.885 --> 01:04:08.760
I mean, that's like--

01:04:08.760 --> 01:04:12.030
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Well, they
don't do formal adjustments.

01:04:12.030 --> 01:04:14.280
When people talk
about compensation

01:04:14.280 --> 01:04:18.030
to try to avoid a focus
on today's share price,

01:04:18.030 --> 01:04:20.610
they usually do things like,
OK, we'll compensate you

01:04:20.610 --> 01:04:22.080
in stock options.

01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:26.400
But you can't cash the
options until five years

01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:29.020
after you've left the company.

01:04:29.020 --> 01:04:32.910
Things like that to
say the stock price

01:04:32.910 --> 01:04:35.550
is $100 today, that's great.

01:04:35.550 --> 01:04:37.530
What we care about isn't
what it is tomorrow,

01:04:37.530 --> 01:04:40.230
we care about what
it is in five years.

01:04:40.230 --> 01:04:43.530
So we want to take away
from you the incentive

01:04:43.530 --> 01:04:47.700
to boost profits today if it's
going to hurt profits tomorrow.

01:04:47.700 --> 01:04:50.460
So it's not a matter of
risk-adjusted compensation.

01:04:50.460 --> 01:04:53.490
It's a matter from the point
of view of the top executives

01:04:53.490 --> 01:04:56.970
to give them incentives
not to add to risk, right?

01:04:56.970 --> 01:04:59.820
I mean, one of the issues
with all the investment banks

01:04:59.820 --> 01:05:09.170
was if there is no downside--

01:05:09.170 --> 01:05:12.450
right-- you take
a huge position,

01:05:12.450 --> 01:05:14.970
that position comes through,
you make a lot of money,

01:05:14.970 --> 01:05:16.230
you get a lot of profits.

01:05:16.230 --> 01:05:18.330
That position doesn't come
through, they fire you.

01:05:18.330 --> 01:05:19.950
OK, you go to another company.

01:05:19.950 --> 01:05:21.480
Well, that's not a great--

01:05:21.480 --> 01:05:23.370
that's not a great model.

01:05:23.370 --> 01:05:25.050
The idea is we
ought to compensate

01:05:25.050 --> 01:05:28.080
you based on performance
over time, not on performance

01:05:28.080 --> 01:05:33.180
last week because if the worst
outcome is you lose the company

01:05:33.180 --> 01:05:35.310
a billion dollars,
you get fired,

01:05:35.310 --> 01:05:36.750
you go to another company--

01:05:36.750 --> 01:05:38.883
where you do it again.

01:05:38.883 --> 01:05:41.050
So they want to-- you want
to give people incentives

01:05:41.050 --> 01:05:43.630
not to put companies at risk.

01:05:43.630 --> 01:05:45.970
You want to give
executives incentives

01:05:45.970 --> 01:05:49.150
not just to think
about the short term.

01:05:49.150 --> 01:05:50.525
It's a difficult matter.

01:05:50.525 --> 01:05:52.400
We will talk a little
bit about compensation,

01:05:52.400 --> 01:05:55.960
but I will say, one of my
favorite sayings from Jack

01:05:55.960 --> 01:05:58.900
Welch when he taught
here was any fool can

01:05:58.900 --> 01:06:02.640
manage for the short term only.

01:06:02.640 --> 01:06:06.030
And it's also true that any fool
can manage for the long term

01:06:06.030 --> 01:06:07.650
only.

01:06:07.650 --> 01:06:11.000
The difficulty is balance.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:11.750
Anything else?

01:06:11.750 --> 01:06:14.440
That's the wisdom for today.

01:06:14.440 --> 01:06:16.390
Yeah, Julien.

01:06:16.390 --> 01:06:18.325
AUDIENCE: If there's
like net market growth,

01:06:18.325 --> 01:06:22.930
[INAUDIBLE] is for an entire
market normalized for 1.

01:06:22.930 --> 01:06:24.560
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Yeah.

01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:26.630
Yeah.

01:06:26.630 --> 01:06:31.100
Because remember, in
a well-diversified--

01:06:31.100 --> 01:06:35.110
if you are well-diversified,
you own a piece of everything.

01:06:35.110 --> 01:06:36.310
That's the best you can do.

01:06:36.310 --> 01:06:40.660
You could hold less
of that risky stuff.

01:06:40.660 --> 01:06:43.270
But the best you can do in
terms of holding risky stuff

01:06:43.270 --> 01:06:45.860
is to hold a little
bit of everything.

01:06:45.860 --> 01:06:49.095
And if you do that, then the
risky part of your portfolio

01:06:49.095 --> 01:06:50.470
moves up and down
with the market

01:06:50.470 --> 01:06:52.540
by definition because
you're holding it,

01:06:52.540 --> 01:06:58.450
so you normalize that to 1 and
the riskless part doesn't move,

01:06:58.450 --> 01:07:00.760
so that's zero.

01:07:00.760 --> 01:07:03.580
You could normalize it
to 16.7 if you wanted to,

01:07:03.580 --> 01:07:06.520
but normalizing it to 1
is the simplest thing.

01:07:06.520 --> 01:07:09.760
And then intermediate--
then mixtures of the two

01:07:09.760 --> 01:07:12.800
will have values
between zero and 1.

01:07:12.800 --> 01:07:13.790
Yeah.

01:07:13.790 --> 01:07:18.780
I mean, the 1's the
normalization, zero is natural.

01:07:18.780 --> 01:07:20.430
Anything else?

01:07:20.430 --> 01:07:22.590
Deep philosophical questions?

01:07:22.590 --> 01:07:26.590
I will need to talk more
slowly in the future.

01:07:26.590 --> 01:07:27.420
And I will do that.

01:07:27.420 --> 01:07:28.720
But I'm done.

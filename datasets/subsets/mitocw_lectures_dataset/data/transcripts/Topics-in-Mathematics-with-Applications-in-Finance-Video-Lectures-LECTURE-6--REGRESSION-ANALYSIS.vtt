00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:24.620
PROFESSOR: Today's topic
is regression analysis.

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:28.950
And this subject
is one that we're

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:32.610
going to cover it today
covering the mathematical and

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.620
statistical foundations
of regression

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.720
and focus particularly
on linear regression.

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:44.840
This methodology is perhaps
the most powerful method

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.630
in statistical modeling.

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:49.640
And the foundations
of it, I think,

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.740
are very, very important
to understand and master,

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:56.320
and they'll help you in any
kind of statistical modeling

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:02.870
exercise you might entertain
during or after this course.

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:07.320
And its popularity in
finance is very, very high,

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.540
but it's also a very
popular methodology

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:15.630
in all other disciplines
that do applied statistics.

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:23.410
So let's begin with setting up
the multiple linear regression

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:24.490
problem.

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:31.760
So we begin with a data set that
consists of data observations

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.640
on different cases,
a number of cases.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:40.110
So we have n cases indexed by i.

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.410
And there's a single variable,
a dependent variable or response

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:47.970
variable, which is
the variable of focus.

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.040
And we'll denote that y sub i.

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.550
And together with that,
for each of the cases,

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.640
there are explanatory variables
that we might observe.

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.330
So the y_i's, the
dependent variables,

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.670
could be returns on stocks.

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.160
The explanatory variables could
be underlying characteristics

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.410
of those stocks
over a given period.

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.090
The dependent variable
could be the change

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:28.360
in value of an index, the S&P
500 index or the yield rate,

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.220
and the explanatory
variables can

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.390
be various macroeconomic
factors or other factors that

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:39.430
might be used to explain how
the response variable changes

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.510
and takes on its value.

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.880
Let's go through various
goals of regression analysis.

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.780
OK, first it can be
to extract or exploit

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.790
the relationship between
the dependent variable

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:51.720
and the independent variable.

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.010
And examples of
this are prediction.

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.830
Indeed, in finance
that's where I've

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:00.075
used regression analysis most.

00:03:00.075 --> 00:03:02.965
We want to predict what's going
to happen and take actions

00:03:02.965 --> 00:03:05.230
to take advantage of that.

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.570
One can also use
regression analysis

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:10.940
to talk about causal inference.

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:16.240
What factors are really
driving a dependent variable?

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.570
And so one can actually
test hypotheses

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:23.930
about what are true
causal factors underlying

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:27.250
the relationships
between the variables.

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:32.430
Another application is for
just simple approximation.

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.870
As mathematicians,
you're all very

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.970
familiar with how
smooth functions can

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.460
be-- that are smooth
in the sense of being

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:43.250
differentiable and bounded.

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:46.565
Those can be approximated
well by a Taylor series

00:03:46.565 --> 00:03:48.690
if you have a function of
a single variable or even

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:53.240
a multivariable function.

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:55.840
So one can use
regression analysis

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.460
to actually approximate
functions nicely.

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:04.370
And one can also use
regression analysis

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:08.600
to uncover functional
relationships

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.724
and validate functional
relationships

00:04:10.724 --> 00:04:11.640
amongst the variables.

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:17.130
So let's set up the
general linear model

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.570
from a mathematical
standpoint to begin with.

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:23.160
In this lecture, OK,
we're going to start off

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:28.050
with discussing ordinary
least squares, which

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:31.070
is a purely mathematical
criterion for how

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:33.580
you specify regression models.

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:38.350
And then we're going to turn to
the Gauss-Markov theorem which

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:42.265
incorporates some statistical
modeling principles there.

00:04:42.265 --> 00:04:45.170
They're essentially
weak principles.

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:49.570
And then we will
turn to formal models

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:52.160
with normal linear
regression models,

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.700
and then consider extensions
of those to broader classes.

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:00.600
Now we're in the
mathematical context.

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:05.180
And a linear model is
basically attempting

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:08.780
to model the conditional
distribution of the response

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:14.580
variable y_i given the
independent variables x_i.

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:21.050
And the conditional distribution
of the response variable

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:25.050
is modeled simply
as a linear function

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:27.230
of the independent variables.

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:32.880
So the x_i's, x_(i,1)
through x_(i,p),

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:36.090
are the key explanatory
variables that relate

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:38.340
to the response
variables, possibly.

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:45.850
And the beta_1, beta_2,
beta_i, or beta_p,

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:49.480
are the regression
parameters which

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:53.190
would be used in defining
that linear relationship.

00:05:53.190 --> 00:06:03.680
So this relationship has
residuals, epsilon_i,

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:07.320
basically where there's
uncertainty in the data--

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:11.100
whether it's either due to a
measurement error or modeling

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:14.535
error or underlying
stochastic processes that

00:06:14.535 --> 00:06:15.980
are driving the error.

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:19.340
This epsilon_i is a
residual error variable

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:24.440
that will indicate how this
linear relationship varies

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:25.915
across the different n cases.

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:33.520
So OK, how broad are the models?

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:38.080
Well, the models
really are very broad.

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:40.020
First of all,
polynomial approximation

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:41.505
is indicated here.

00:06:41.505 --> 00:06:45.630
It corresponds, essentially,
to a truncated Taylor

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:49.170
series approximation
to a functional form.

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:56.240
With variables that
exhibit cyclical behavior,

00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:03.200
Fourier series can be applied
in a linear regression context.

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:06.020
How many people in here are
familiar with Fourier series?

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:09.870
Almost everybody.

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:13.530
So Fourier series
basically provide

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:17.650
a set of basis functions
that allow you to closely

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:19.250
approximate most functions.

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:21.540
And certainly with
bounded functions

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:24.510
that possibly have a
cyclical structure to them,

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:27.120
it provides a
complete description.

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:30.940
So we could apply
Fourier series here.

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:38.640
Finally, time series regressions
where the cases i one through n

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:42.360
are really indexes of different
time points can be applied.

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:46.650
And so the independent
variables can

00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:50.660
be variables that are
observable at a given time point

00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:51.910
or known at a given time.

00:07:51.910 --> 00:07:55.810
So those can include lags
of the response variables.

00:07:55.810 --> 00:08:00.530
So we'll see actually when
we talk about time series

00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:02.880
that there's
autoregressive time series

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:05.870
models that can be specified.

00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:11.410
And those are very broadly
applied in finance.

00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:23.510
All right, so let's go through
what the steps are for fitting

00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:24.840
a regression model.

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:31.760
First, one wants
to propose a model

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:33.600
in terms of what
is it that we have

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:38.727
to identify or be interested in
a particular response variable.

00:08:38.727 --> 00:08:42.934
And critical here is
specifying the scale

00:08:42.934 --> 00:08:47.010
of that response variable.

00:08:47.010 --> 00:08:51.280
Choongbum was discussing
problems of modeling stock

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:52.450
prices.

00:08:52.450 --> 00:08:55.030
If, say, y is the stock price?

00:08:55.030 --> 00:09:00.090
Well, it may be that it's
more appropriate to consider

00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:06.320
modeling it on a logarithmic
scale than on a linear scale.

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:09.780
Who can tell me why that
would be a good idea?

00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:11.740
AUDIENCE: Because
the changes might

00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:13.700
become more percent
changes in price

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:16.365
rather than absolute
changes in price.

00:09:16.365 --> 00:09:17.490
PROFESSOR: Very good, yeah.

00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:21.540
So price changes basically
on the percentage scale,

00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:25.680
which log changes would be,
may be much better predicted

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:30.410
by knowing factors than
the absolute price level.

00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:35.940
OK, and so we have
to have a collection

00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:40.070
of independent variables,
which to include in the model.

00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:42.970
And it's important
to think about how

00:09:42.970 --> 00:09:44.590
general this set up is.

00:09:44.590 --> 00:09:46.450
I mean, the
independent variables

00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:50.140
can be functions, lag values
of the response variable.

00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:52.270
They can be different
functional forms

00:09:52.270 --> 00:09:53.670
of other independent variables.

00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:58.720
So the fact that we're talking
about a linear regression model

00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:03.590
here is it's not so limiting
in terms of the linearity.

00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:06.050
We can really capture
lot of nonlinear behavior

00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:07.730
in this framework.

00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:11.290
So then third, we need to
address the assumptions

00:10:11.290 --> 00:10:15.020
about the distribution of
the residuals, epsilon,

00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:16.820
over the cases.

00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:21.150
So that has to be specified.

00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:23.610
Once we've set up
the model in terms

00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:27.160
of identifying the response
of the explanatory variables

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:29.700
and the assumptions
underlying the distribution

00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:35.080
of the residuals, we need to
specify a criterion for judging

00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:36.550
different estimators.

00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:40.840
So given a particular
setup, what we want to do

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:48.000
is be able to define a
methodology for specifying

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.580
the regression parameters
so that we can then

00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:54.010
use this regression
model for prediction

00:10:54.010 --> 00:10:56.670
or whatever our purpose is.

00:10:56.670 --> 00:11:00.700
So the second
thing we want to do

00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:03.460
is define a criterion
for how we might

00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:09.090
judge different estimators of
the progression parameters.

00:11:09.090 --> 00:11:11.210
We're going to go
through several of those.

00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:15.200
And you'll see those-- least
squares is the first one,

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:17.210
but there are actually
more general ones.

00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:19.290
In fact, the last
section of this lecture

00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:22.930
on generalized estimators
will cover those as well.

00:11:22.930 --> 00:11:25.740
Third, we need to characterize
the best estimator

00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:27.600
and apply it to the given data.

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:31.401
So once we choose a
criterion for how good

00:11:31.401 --> 00:11:32.900
an estimate of
regression parameters

00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:37.080
is, then we have to have
a technology for solving

00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:38.060
for that.

00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:43.030
And then fourth, we need
to check our assumptions.

00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:48.770
Now, it's very often the case
that at this fourth step, where

00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:51.160
you're checking the
assumptions that you've made,

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:55.370
you'll discover features
of your data or the process

00:11:55.370 --> 00:11:58.550
that it's modeling
that make you want

00:11:58.550 --> 00:12:01.520
to expand upon your assumptions
or change your assumptions.

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:06.410
And so checking the
assumptions is a critical part

00:12:06.410 --> 00:12:08.170
of any modeling process.

00:12:08.170 --> 00:12:11.830
And then if necessary, modify
the model and assumptions

00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:15.260
and repeat this process.

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:18.660
What I can tell you
is that this sort

00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:21.280
of protocol for
how you fit models

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:26.680
is what I've applied
many, many times.

00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:31.870
And if you are lucky in a
particular problem area,

00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:34.430
the very simple
models will work well

00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:37.340
with small changes
in assumptions.

00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:39.450
But when you get
challenging problems,

00:12:39.450 --> 00:12:43.900
then this item five
of modify the model

00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:46.300
and/or assumptions is critical.

00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:50.790
And in statistical
modeling, my philosophy

00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:53.340
is you really want to,
as much as possible,

00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:55.390
tailor the model to the
process you're modeling.

00:12:55.390 --> 00:12:59.070
You don't want to fit a
square peg in a round hole

00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:01.200
and just apply, say,
simple linear regression

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:02.510
to everything.

00:13:02.510 --> 00:13:06.191
You want to apply it when
the assumptions are valid.

00:13:06.191 --> 00:13:07.940
If the assumptions
aren't valid, maybe you

00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:10.680
can change the
specification of the problem

00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:14.890
so a linear model is still
applicable in a changed

00:13:14.890 --> 00:13:16.060
framework.

00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:18.530
But if not, then
you'll want to extend

00:13:18.530 --> 00:13:20.250
to other kinds of models.

00:13:20.250 --> 00:13:22.120
But what we'll be
doing-- or what

00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:24.680
you will be doing if you do
that-- is basically applying

00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:28.120
all the same principles
that are developed

00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:30.140
in the linear
modeling framework.

00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:38.320
OK, now let's see.

00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:39.860
I wanted to make
some comments here

00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:43.975
about specifying assumptions
for the residual distribution.

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:49.620
What kind of assumptions
might we make?

00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:52.840
OK, would anyone like to
suggest some assumptions

00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:55.640
you might make in
a linear regression

00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:58.310
model for the residuals?

00:13:58.310 --> 00:13:58.980
Yes?

00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:00.006
What's your name, by the way?

00:14:00.006 --> 00:14:00.700
AUDIENCE: My name is Will.

00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:01.533
PROFESSOR: Will, OK.

00:14:01.533 --> 00:14:02.455
Will what?

00:14:02.455 --> 00:14:02.900
[? AUDIENCE: Ossler. ?]

00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:03.460
PROFESSOR: [? Ossler, ?] great.

00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:04.910
OK, thank you, Will.

00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:06.480
AUDIENCE: It might
be-- or we might

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:10.000
want to say that the residual
might be normally distributed

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:17.598
and it might not depend too
much on what value of the input

00:14:17.598 --> 00:14:19.000
variable we'd use.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.540
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:21.090
Anyone else?

00:14:23.810 --> 00:14:24.310
OK.

00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:27.930
Well, that certainly
is an excellent place

00:14:27.930 --> 00:14:33.510
to start in terms of starting
with a distribution that's

00:14:33.510 --> 00:14:35.391
familiar.

00:14:35.391 --> 00:14:36.390
Familiar is always good.

00:14:36.390 --> 00:14:38.598
Although it's not something
that should be necessary,

00:14:38.598 --> 00:14:44.210
but we know from some of
Choongbum's lecture areas

00:14:44.210 --> 00:14:46.470
that Gaussian and
normal distributions

00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:49.670
arise in many
settings where we're

00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:53.900
taking basically sums of
independent, random variables.

00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:58.180
And so it may be that these
residuals are like that.

00:14:58.180 --> 00:15:04.910
Anyway, a slightly simpler
or weaker condition

00:15:04.910 --> 00:15:10.110
is to use the Gauss-- what
are called in statistics

00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:12.400
the Gauss-Markov assumptions.

00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:15.340
And these are assumptions
where we're only

00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:20.390
concerned with the means
or averages, statistically,

00:15:20.390 --> 00:15:23.210
and the variances
of the residuals.

00:15:23.210 --> 00:15:26.160
And so we assume that
there's zero mean.

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:30.230
So on average, they're not
adding a bias up or down

00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:32.580
to the dependent variable.

00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:36.920
And those have a
constant variance.

00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:40.830
So the level of
uncertainty in our model

00:15:40.830 --> 00:15:43.210
doesn't depend on the case.

00:15:43.210 --> 00:15:47.660
And so indeed, if errors
on the percentage scale

00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:51.250
are more appropriate, then
one could look at, say,

00:15:51.250 --> 00:15:53.970
a time series of prices
that you're trying to model.

00:15:53.970 --> 00:15:56.970
And it may be that
on the log scale,

00:15:56.970 --> 00:15:59.160
that constant variance
looks much more appropriate

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:02.180
than on the original
scale, which would have--

00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:06.660
And then a third attribute of
the Gauss-Markov assumptions

00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:10.740
is that the residuals
are uncorrelated.

00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:16.770
So now uncorrelated does
not mean independent

00:16:16.770 --> 00:16:18.210
or statistically independent.

00:16:18.210 --> 00:16:21.470
So this is a somewhat weak
condition, or weaker condition,

00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:24.326
than independence
of the residuals.

00:16:24.326 --> 00:16:26.280
But in the Gauss-Markov
setting, we're

00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:29.650
just setting up
basically a reduced set

00:16:29.650 --> 00:16:33.610
of assumptions that we might
apply to fit the model.

00:16:33.610 --> 00:16:36.620
If we extend upon
that, we can then

00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:40.040
consider normal linear
regression models,

00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:44.050
which Will just suggested.

00:16:44.050 --> 00:16:48.930
And in this case, those could
be assumed to be independent

00:16:48.930 --> 00:16:50.440
and identically
distributed-- IID

00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:56.380
is that notation for that-- with
Gaussian or normal with mean 0

00:16:56.380 --> 00:16:57.580
and variance sigma squared.

00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:03.050
We can extend upon
that to consider

00:17:03.050 --> 00:17:07.140
generalized Gauss-Markov
assumptions where we maintain

00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:09.750
still the zero mean
for the residuals,

00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:15.990
but the general-- we might
have a covariance matrix which

00:17:15.990 --> 00:17:18.560
does not correspond to
independent and identically

00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:20.680
distributed random variables.

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:21.760
Now, let's see.

00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:25.000
In the discussion of
probability theory,

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:29.400
we really haven't talked yet
about matrix-valued random

00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:31.490
variables, right?

00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:34.360
But how many people
in the class have

00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:37.380
covered matrix-value or
vector-valued random variables

00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:39.660
before?

00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:41.120
OK, just a handful.

00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:47.290
Well, a vector-valued
random variable,

00:17:47.290 --> 00:17:51.090
we think of the
values of these n

00:17:51.090 --> 00:17:57.200
cases for the dependent variable
to be an n-valued, an n-vector

00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:59.950
of random variables.

00:17:59.950 --> 00:18:05.600
And so we can
generalize the variance

00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:09.140
of individual random variables
to the variance covariance

00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:12.870
matrix of the collection.

00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:18.490
And so you have a covariance
matrix characterizing

00:18:18.490 --> 00:18:25.930
the variance of the n-vector
which gives us the-- the (i, j)

00:18:25.930 --> 00:18:31.640
element gives us the
value of the covariance.

00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:38.130
All right, let me put
the screen up and just

00:18:38.130 --> 00:18:41.214
write that on the board so
that you're familiar with that.

00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:58.270
All right, so we have
y_1, y_2, down to y_n,

00:18:58.270 --> 00:19:03.070
our n values of our
response variable.

00:19:03.070 --> 00:19:10.755
And we can basically talk
about the expectation

00:19:10.755 --> 00:19:18.303
of that being equal to
mu_1, mu_2, down to mu_n.

00:19:21.021 --> 00:19:38.270
And the covariance matrix
of y_1, y_2, down to y_n

00:19:38.270 --> 00:19:46.060
is equal to a matrix
with the variance of y_1

00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:53.280
in the upper 1, 1 element, and
the variance of y_2 in the 2,

00:19:53.280 --> 00:20:04.760
2 element, and the variance of
y_n in the nth column and nth

00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:05.890
row.

00:20:05.890 --> 00:20:15.080
And in the (i,j)-th row, (i, j),
we have the covariance between

00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:18.550
y_i and y_j.

00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:24.070
So we're going to use matrices
to represent covariances.

00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:26.670
And that's something
which I want everyone

00:20:26.670 --> 00:20:28.900
to get very familiar
with because we're

00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:31.750
going to assume that we
are comfortable with those,

00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:38.470
and apply matrix algebra with
these kinds of constructs.

00:20:38.470 --> 00:20:41.300
So the generalized
Gauss-Markov theorem

00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:43.960
assumes a general
covariance matrix

00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:50.400
where you can have
nonzero covariances

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:52.260
between the
independent variables

00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:54.440
or the dependent variables
and the residuals.

00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:58.450
And those can be correlated.

00:20:58.450 --> 00:21:03.160
Now, who can come
up with an example

00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:11.471
of why the residuals might
be correlated in a regression

00:21:11.471 --> 00:21:11.970
model?

00:21:15.134 --> 00:21:16.490
Dan?

00:21:16.490 --> 00:21:17.390
OK.

00:21:17.390 --> 00:21:21.100
That's a really good example
because it's nonlinear.

00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:24.720
If you imagine sort of
a simple nonlinear curve

00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:27.070
and you try to fit a
straight line to it,

00:21:27.070 --> 00:21:32.080
then the residuals
from that linear fit

00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:35.100
are going to be consistently
above or below the line

00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:37.630
depending on where you are
in the nonlinearity, how

00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:38.820
it might be fitting.

00:21:38.820 --> 00:21:42.410
So that's one example
where that could arise.

00:21:42.410 --> 00:21:43.415
Any other possibilities?

00:21:46.090 --> 00:21:50.380
Well, next week we'll be talking
about some time series models.

00:21:50.380 --> 00:21:54.650
And there can be time
dependence amongst variables

00:21:54.650 --> 00:21:57.170
where there are some
underlying factors maybe

00:21:57.170 --> 00:21:58.850
that are driving the process.

00:21:58.850 --> 00:22:02.030
And those ongoing
factors can persist

00:22:02.030 --> 00:22:05.480
in making the
linear relationship

00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:11.300
over or under gauge
the dependent variable.

00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:13.850
So that can happen as well.

00:22:13.850 --> 00:22:17.410
All right, yes?

00:22:17.410 --> 00:22:19.949
AUDIENCE: The Gauss-Markov
is just the diagonal case?

00:22:19.949 --> 00:22:22.490
PROFESSOR: Yes, the Gauss-Markov
is simply the diagonal case.

00:22:22.490 --> 00:22:27.090
And explicitly if we replace
y's here by the residuals,

00:22:27.090 --> 00:22:30.780
epsilon_1 through
epsilon_n, then

00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:36.930
that diagonal matrix
with a constant diagonal

00:22:36.930 --> 00:22:41.948
is the simple Gauss-Markov
assumption, yeah.

00:22:45.270 --> 00:22:48.920
Now, I'm sure it
comes as no surprise

00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:51.450
that Gaussian distributions
don't always fit everything.

00:22:51.450 --> 00:22:55.350
And so one needs to get
clever with extending

00:22:55.350 --> 00:23:01.560
the models to other cases.

00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:07.280
And there are-- I know--
Laplace distributions, Pareto

00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:09.760
distributions, contaminated
normal distributions,

00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:14.000
which can be used to
fit regression models.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:22.330
And these general cases really
extend the applicability

00:23:22.330 --> 00:23:28.610
of regression models to
many interesting settings.

00:23:28.610 --> 00:23:35.530
So let's turn to specifying
the estimator criterion in two.

00:23:35.530 --> 00:23:39.590
So how do we judge what's a
good estimate of the regression

00:23:39.590 --> 00:23:40.580
parameters?

00:23:40.580 --> 00:23:45.390
Well, we're going to cover least
squares, maximum likelihood,

00:23:45.390 --> 00:23:50.990
robust methods, which are
contamination resistant.

00:23:50.990 --> 00:23:56.370
And other methods exist
that we will mention but not

00:23:56.370 --> 00:23:57.870
get into really in
the lectures, are

00:23:57.870 --> 00:24:03.390
Bayes methods and accommodating
incomplete or missing data.

00:24:03.390 --> 00:24:08.150
Essentially, as your approach
to modeling a problem

00:24:08.150 --> 00:24:10.120
gets more and more
realistic, you

00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:14.580
start adding more and more
complexity as it's needed.

00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:24.450
And certainly issues
of-- well, robust methods

00:24:24.450 --> 00:24:26.724
is where you assume
most of the data

00:24:26.724 --> 00:24:28.890
arrives under normal
conditions, but once in a while

00:24:28.890 --> 00:24:31.710
there may be some
problem with the data.

00:24:31.710 --> 00:24:34.390
And you don't want
your methodology just

00:24:34.390 --> 00:24:39.635
to break down if there happens
to be some outliers in the data

00:24:39.635 --> 00:24:41.090
or contamination.

00:24:41.090 --> 00:24:47.200
Bayes methodologies
are the technology

00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:50.300
for incorporating
subjective beliefs

00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:54.310
into statistical models.

00:24:54.310 --> 00:24:57.190
And I think it's fair
to say that probably

00:24:57.190 --> 00:25:01.720
all statistical modeling
is essentially subjective.

00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:05.820
And so if you're going to be
good at statistical modeling,

00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:08.779
you want to be sure that you're
effectively incorporating

00:25:08.779 --> 00:25:10.070
subjective information in that.

00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:13.400
And so Bayes methodologies
are very, very useful,

00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:16.460
and indeed pretty much
required to engage

00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:19.610
in appropriate modeling.

00:25:19.610 --> 00:25:22.700
And then finally, accommodate
incomplete or missing data.

00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:26.920
The world is always sort
of cruel in terms of you

00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:30.900
often are missing what you
think is critical information

00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:32.060
to do your analysis.

00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:34.520
And so how do you
deal with situations

00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:39.680
where you have some
holes in your data?

00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:44.720
Statistical models provide
good methods and tools

00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:46.596
for dealing with that situation.

00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:49.720
OK.

00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:50.960
Then let's see.

00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:55.930
In case analyses for
checking assumptions,

00:25:55.930 --> 00:25:57.540
let me go through this.

00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:03.790
Basically when you fit
a regression model,

00:26:03.790 --> 00:26:07.680
you check assumptions by
looking at the residuals, which

00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:16.330
are the basically estimates of
the epsilons, the deviations

00:26:16.330 --> 00:26:22.359
of the dependent variable
from their predictions.

00:26:22.359 --> 00:26:25.930
And what one wants
to do is analyze

00:26:25.930 --> 00:26:29.660
these to determine whether our
assumptions are appropriate.

00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:33.460
OK, but the Gauss-Markov
assumptions would be,

00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:36.170
do these appear to
have constant variance?

00:26:36.170 --> 00:26:40.270
And it may be that their
variance depends on time,

00:26:40.270 --> 00:26:42.555
if the i is indexing time.

00:26:45.450 --> 00:26:48.190
Residuals might depend on
the other variables as well,

00:26:48.190 --> 00:26:53.610
and one wants to determine
that that isn't the case.

00:26:53.610 --> 00:26:57.660
There are also influence
diagnostics identifying cases

00:26:57.660 --> 00:27:00.330
which are highly influential.

00:27:00.330 --> 00:27:05.620
It turns out that when you
are building a regression

00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:10.560
model with data, you
treat all the cases as

00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:12.830
if they're equally important.

00:27:12.830 --> 00:27:15.390
Well, it may be
that certain cases

00:27:15.390 --> 00:27:19.540
are really critical to
estimated certain factors.

00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:25.650
And it may be that much of the
inference about how important

00:27:25.650 --> 00:27:27.940
a certain factor
is is determined

00:27:27.940 --> 00:27:30.550
by very small number of points.

00:27:30.550 --> 00:27:32.875
So even though you
have a massive data set

00:27:32.875 --> 00:27:34.265
that you're using
to fit a model,

00:27:34.265 --> 00:27:36.675
it could be that
some of the structure

00:27:36.675 --> 00:27:39.600
is driven by a very
small number of cases.

00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:45.100
So influence diagnostics give
you a way of analyzing that.

00:27:45.100 --> 00:27:50.730
In the problem set
for this lecture,

00:27:50.730 --> 00:27:53.470
you'll be deriving some
influence diagnostics

00:27:53.470 --> 00:27:55.380
for linear regression
models and seeing how

00:27:55.380 --> 00:27:57.790
they're mathematically defined.

00:27:57.790 --> 00:28:01.150
And I'll be distributing
a case study which

00:28:01.150 --> 00:28:04.290
illustrates fitting
linear regression

00:28:04.290 --> 00:28:06.350
models for asset prices.

00:28:06.350 --> 00:28:10.502
And you can see
how those play out

00:28:10.502 --> 00:28:11.710
with some practical examples.

00:28:16.170 --> 00:28:18.525
OK, finally there's
outlier detection.

00:28:21.210 --> 00:28:25.790
With outliers, it's interesting.

00:28:25.790 --> 00:28:33.100
The exceptions in data are
often the most interesting.

00:28:33.100 --> 00:28:36.560
It's important in
modeling to understand

00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:40.700
whether certain
cases are unusual.

00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:47.600
And sometimes their
degree of idiosyncrasy

00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:50.580
can be explained away
so that one essentially

00:28:50.580 --> 00:28:51.710
discards those outliers.

00:28:51.710 --> 00:28:54.790
But other times,
those idiosyncrasies

00:28:54.790 --> 00:28:57.890
lead to extensions of the model.

00:28:57.890 --> 00:29:04.345
And so outlier detection can be
very important for validating

00:29:04.345 --> 00:29:05.980
a model.

00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:10.970
OK, so with that introduction to
regression, linear regression,

00:29:10.970 --> 00:29:14.590
let's talk about
ordinary least squares.

00:29:14.590 --> 00:29:15.090
Ah.

00:29:19.075 --> 00:29:24.360
OK, the least squares criterion
is for a given a regression

00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:27.120
parameter, beta,
which is considered

00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:32.160
to be a column vector-- so I'm
taking the transpose of a row

00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:32.660
vector.

00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:39.610
The least squares criterion
is to basically take

00:29:39.610 --> 00:29:43.170
the sum of square deviations
from the actual value

00:29:43.170 --> 00:29:46.160
of the response variable
from its linear prediction.

00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:48.760
So y_i minus y hat i,
we're just plugging

00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:50.980
in for y hat i the
linear function

00:29:50.980 --> 00:29:55.470
of the independent variables
and the squaring that.

00:29:58.270 --> 00:30:01.570
And the ordinary least
squares estimate, beta hat,

00:30:01.570 --> 00:30:05.490
minimizes this function.

00:30:05.490 --> 00:30:11.520
So in order to solve for this,
we're going to use matrices.

00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:16.627
And so we're going to take
the y vector, the vector of n

00:30:16.627 --> 00:30:18.002
values of the
dependent variable,

00:30:18.002 --> 00:30:21.710
or the response variable,
and X, the matrix

00:30:21.710 --> 00:30:24.210
of values of the
independent variable.

00:30:24.210 --> 00:30:28.800
It's important in this
set up to keep straight

00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:32.990
that cases go by
rows and columns

00:30:32.990 --> 00:30:35.585
go by values of the
independent variable.

00:30:41.410 --> 00:30:44.450
Boy, this thing is
ultra sensitive.

00:30:44.450 --> 00:30:44.950
Excuse me.

00:30:49.317 --> 00:30:50.650
Do I turn off the touchpad here?

00:30:50.650 --> 00:30:53.050
OK.

00:30:53.050 --> 00:31:01.990
So we can now define
our fitted value, y hat,

00:31:01.990 --> 00:31:06.330
to be equal to the
matrix x times beta.

00:31:06.330 --> 00:31:10.940
And with matrix multiplication,
that results in the y hat 1

00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:13.350
through y hat n.

00:31:13.350 --> 00:31:20.800
And Q of beta can basically
be written as y minus X beta

00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:23.330
transpose y minus X beta.

00:31:23.330 --> 00:31:27.580
So this term here is an
n-vector minus the product

00:31:27.580 --> 00:31:30.990
of the X matrix times beta,
which is another n-vector.

00:31:30.990 --> 00:31:33.380
And we're just taking the
cross product of that.

00:31:37.410 --> 00:31:41.460
And the ordinary least
squares estimate for beta

00:31:41.460 --> 00:31:47.650
solves the derivative of
this criterion equaling 0.

00:31:47.650 --> 00:31:53.990
Now, that's in
fact true, but who

00:31:53.990 --> 00:31:55.400
can tell me why that's true?

00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:00.860
Say again?

00:32:00.860 --> 00:32:01.750
AUDIENCE: Is that minimum?

00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:02.333
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:32:02.333 --> 00:32:04.763
So your name?

00:32:04.763 --> 00:32:05.610
AUDIENCE: Seth.

00:32:05.610 --> 00:32:06.313
PROFESSOR: Seth?

00:32:06.313 --> 00:32:06.812
Seth.

00:32:06.812 --> 00:32:07.760
Very good, Seth.

00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:08.850
Thanks, Seth.

00:32:08.850 --> 00:32:13.200
So if we want to
find a minimum of Q,

00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:17.120
then that minimum will have,
if it's a smooth function,

00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:20.950
will have a minimum
at slope equals 0.

00:32:20.950 --> 00:32:23.405
Now, how do we know whether
it's a minimum or not?

00:32:23.405 --> 00:32:25.424
It could be a maximum.

00:32:25.424 --> 00:32:26.340
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:30.430
PROFESSOR: OK, right.

00:32:30.430 --> 00:32:34.050
So in fact, this
is a-- Q of beta

00:32:34.050 --> 00:32:39.160
is a convex function of beta.

00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:44.770
And so its second
derivative is positive.

00:32:44.770 --> 00:32:52.140
And if you basically think
about the set-- basically,

00:32:52.140 --> 00:32:54.310
this is the first
derivative of Q with respect

00:32:54.310 --> 00:32:55.680
to beta equaling 0.

00:32:55.680 --> 00:32:58.420
If you were to solve for
the second derivative of Q

00:32:58.420 --> 00:33:03.060
with respect to beta,
well, beta is a p-vector.

00:33:03.060 --> 00:33:04.560
So the second
derivative is actually

00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:11.240
a second derivative
matrix, and that matrix,

00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:12.540
you can solve for it.

00:33:12.540 --> 00:33:14.360
It will be X
transpose X, which is

00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:18.730
a positive definite or
semi-definite matrix.

00:33:18.730 --> 00:33:23.950
So it basically had a
positive derivative there.

00:33:23.950 --> 00:33:27.210
So anyway, this ordinary
least squares estimates

00:33:27.210 --> 00:33:32.370
will solve this d Q of
beta by d beta equals 0.

00:33:32.370 --> 00:33:36.330
What does d Q beta by d beta_j?

00:33:36.330 --> 00:33:40.980
Well, you just take the
derivative of this sum.

00:33:44.530 --> 00:33:47.390
So we're taking the sum
of all these elements.

00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:53.640
And if you take the
derivative-- well,

00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:57.210
OK, the derivative
is a linear operator.

00:33:57.210 --> 00:34:00.450
So the derivative of a sum is
the sum of the derivatives.

00:34:00.450 --> 00:34:04.150
So we take the summation out and
we take the derivative of each

00:34:04.150 --> 00:34:09.929
term, so we get 2 minus x_(i,j),
then the thing in square

00:34:09.929 --> 00:34:11.399
brackets, y_i minus that.

00:34:15.239 --> 00:34:16.139
And what is that?

00:34:16.139 --> 00:34:19.090
Well, in matrix
notation, if we let

00:34:19.090 --> 00:34:22.469
this sort of bold X
sub square j denote

00:34:22.469 --> 00:34:25.670
the j-th column of the
independent variables,

00:34:25.670 --> 00:34:28.219
then this is minus 2.

00:34:28.219 --> 00:34:35.350
Basically, the j-th column of X
transpose times y minus X beta.

00:34:35.350 --> 00:34:42.940
So this j-th equation for
ordinary least squares

00:34:42.940 --> 00:34:46.980
has that representation in
terms-- in matrix notation.

00:34:46.980 --> 00:34:51.860
Now if we put that all
together, we basically

00:34:51.860 --> 00:34:55.400
can define this derivative
of Q with respect

00:34:55.400 --> 00:34:57.740
to the different
regression parameters

00:34:57.740 --> 00:35:05.640
as basically the minus twice
the j-th column stacked times y

00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:10.120
minus X beta, which is simply
minus 2 X transpose, y minus X

00:35:10.120 --> 00:35:11.040
beta.

00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:14.870
And this has to equal 0.

00:35:14.870 --> 00:35:19.550
And if we just simplify,
taking out the two,

00:35:19.550 --> 00:35:22.140
we get this set of equations.

00:35:22.140 --> 00:35:25.560
It must be satisfied by
the ordinary least squares

00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:27.190
estimate, beta.

00:35:27.190 --> 00:35:31.960
And that's called the
normal equations in books

00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:35.270
on regression modeling.

00:35:35.270 --> 00:35:37.310
So let's consider
how we solve that.

00:35:37.310 --> 00:35:43.100
Well, we can re-express that
by multiplying through the X

00:35:43.100 --> 00:35:46.010
transpose on each of the terms.

00:35:46.010 --> 00:35:54.770
And then beta hat basically
solves this equation.

00:35:54.770 --> 00:35:58.170
And if X transpose
X inverse exists,

00:35:58.170 --> 00:36:02.385
we get beta hat is equal
to X transpose X inverse X

00:36:02.385 --> 00:36:04.920
transpose y.

00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:11.030
So with matrix algebra, we
can actually solve this.

00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:14.530
And matrix algebra
is going to be

00:36:14.530 --> 00:36:16.910
very important to this
lecture and other lectures.

00:36:16.910 --> 00:36:20.260
So if this stuff is-- if
you're a bit rusty on this,

00:36:20.260 --> 00:36:22.210
do brush up.

00:36:26.370 --> 00:36:29.610
This particular
solution for beta hat

00:36:29.610 --> 00:36:37.980
assumes that X transpose
X inverse exists.

00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:42.920
Who can tell me
what assumptions do

00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:47.290
we need to make for X
transpose X to have an inverse?

00:36:52.110 --> 00:36:55.910
I'll call you in a second
if no one else does.

00:36:55.910 --> 00:36:59.528
Somebody just said something.

00:36:59.528 --> 00:37:01.370
Someone else.

00:37:01.370 --> 00:37:01.870
No?

00:37:01.870 --> 00:37:02.030
All right.

00:37:02.030 --> 00:37:02.400
OK, Will.

00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:03.860
AUDIENCE: So X
transpose X inverse

00:37:03.860 --> 00:37:06.160
needs to have full
rank, which means

00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:10.269
that each of the submatrices
needs to have [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:10.269 --> 00:37:11.750
smaller dimension.

00:37:11.750 --> 00:37:15.305
PROFESSOR: OK, so Will said,
basically, the matrix X

00:37:15.305 --> 00:37:17.250
needs to have full rank.

00:37:17.250 --> 00:37:23.990
And so if X has full rank,
then-- well, let's see.

00:37:23.990 --> 00:37:29.340
If X has full rank, then the
singular value decomposition

00:37:29.340 --> 00:37:35.990
which was in the very
first class can exist.

00:37:35.990 --> 00:37:40.330
And you have basically
p singular values

00:37:40.330 --> 00:37:42.730
that are all non-zero.

00:37:42.730 --> 00:37:46.100
And X transpose X
can be expressed

00:37:46.100 --> 00:37:50.610
as sort of a, from the
singular value decomposition,

00:37:50.610 --> 00:37:53.110
as one of the orthogonal
matrices times the square

00:37:53.110 --> 00:37:57.145
of the singular values times
that same matrix transpose,

00:37:57.145 --> 00:37:59.390
if you recall that definition.

00:37:59.390 --> 00:38:02.420
So that actually
is-- it basically

00:38:02.420 --> 00:38:06.590
provides a solution for X
transpose X inverse, indeed,

00:38:06.590 --> 00:38:08.810
from the singular value
decomposition of X.

00:38:08.810 --> 00:38:11.910
But what's required is that
you have a full rank in X.

00:38:11.910 --> 00:38:14.450
And what that means
is that you can't have

00:38:14.450 --> 00:38:20.120
independent variables
that are explained

00:38:20.120 --> 00:38:21.950
by other independent variables.

00:38:21.950 --> 00:38:29.010
So different columns of
X have to be linear--

00:38:29.010 --> 00:38:32.670
or they can't linearly depend
on any other columns of X.

00:38:32.670 --> 00:38:34.670
Otherwise, you would
have reduced rank.

00:38:37.460 --> 00:38:44.570
So now if beta hat
doesn't have full rank,

00:38:44.570 --> 00:38:49.380
then our least squares estimate
of beta might be non-unique.

00:38:49.380 --> 00:38:53.280
And in fact, it is
the case that if you

00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:55.600
are really interested
in just predicting

00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:59.180
values of a dependent
variable, then

00:38:59.180 --> 00:39:03.440
having non-unique
least squares estimates

00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:05.530
isn't as much of a
problem, because you still

00:39:05.530 --> 00:39:07.090
get estimates out of that.

00:39:07.090 --> 00:39:11.302
But for now, we want to assume
that there's full column rank

00:39:11.302 --> 00:39:12.510
in the independent variables.

00:39:16.010 --> 00:39:17.510
All right.

00:39:17.510 --> 00:39:30.100
Now, if we plug in the value
of the solution for the least

00:39:30.100 --> 00:39:34.780
squares estimate,
we get fitted values

00:39:34.780 --> 00:39:41.960
for the response variable, which
are simply the matrix X times

00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:44.370
beta hat.

00:39:44.370 --> 00:39:52.070
And this expression
for the fitted values

00:39:52.070 --> 00:39:58.570
is basically X times X transpose
X inverse X transpose y,

00:39:58.570 --> 00:40:01.330
which we can represent as Hy.

00:40:01.330 --> 00:40:08.160
Basically, this H matrix in
linear models and statistics

00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:09.770
is called the hat matrix.

00:40:09.770 --> 00:40:12.310
It's basically a
projection matrix

00:40:12.310 --> 00:40:19.120
that takes the linear vector,
or the vector of values

00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:24.290
of the response variable,
into the fitted values.

00:40:24.290 --> 00:40:30.713
So this hat matrix
is quite important.

00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:37.745
The problem set's going
to cover some features,

00:40:37.745 --> 00:40:39.695
go into some properties
of the hat matrix.

00:40:42.790 --> 00:40:49.180
Does anyone want to make any
comments about this hat matrix?

00:40:49.180 --> 00:40:52.290
It's actually a very
special type of matrix.

00:40:52.290 --> 00:40:56.230
Does anyone want to point out
what that special type is?

00:41:00.420 --> 00:41:02.811
It's a projection matrix, OK.

00:41:02.811 --> 00:41:03.310
Yeah.

00:41:03.310 --> 00:41:08.490
And in linear algebra,
projection matrices

00:41:08.490 --> 00:41:11.970
have some very
special properties.

00:41:11.970 --> 00:41:17.400
And it's actually an
orthogonal projection matrix.

00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:24.030
And so if you're
interested in that feature,

00:41:24.030 --> 00:41:25.290
you should look into that.

00:41:25.290 --> 00:41:30.635
But it's really a very rich
set of properties associated

00:41:30.635 --> 00:41:31.510
with this hat matrix.

00:41:31.510 --> 00:41:36.970
It's an orthogonal projection,
and it's-- let's see.

00:41:36.970 --> 00:41:38.180
What's it projecting?

00:41:38.180 --> 00:41:40.600
It's projecting from
n-space into what?

00:41:44.570 --> 00:41:45.150
Go ahead.

00:41:45.150 --> 00:41:46.396
What's your name?

00:41:46.396 --> 00:41:47.062
AUDIENCE: Ethan.

00:41:47.062 --> 00:41:47.870
PROFESSOR: Ethan, OK.

00:41:47.870 --> 00:41:49.203
AUDIENCE: Into space [INAUDIBLE]

00:41:51.250 --> 00:41:52.375
PROFESSOR: Basically, yeah.

00:41:52.375 --> 00:41:55.930
It's projecting into
the column space of X.

00:41:55.930 --> 00:42:00.730
So that's what linear
regression is doing.

00:42:00.730 --> 00:42:05.220
So in focusing and
understanding linear regression,

00:42:05.220 --> 00:42:08.620
you can think of, how do we
get estimates of this p-vector?

00:42:08.620 --> 00:42:11.880
That's all very good and useful,
and we'll do a lot of that.

00:42:11.880 --> 00:42:13.880
But you can also
think of it as, what's

00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:15.750
happening in the
n-dimensional space?

00:42:15.750 --> 00:42:17.660
So you basically
are representing

00:42:17.660 --> 00:42:21.960
this n-dimensional vector
y by its projection

00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:23.180
onto the column space.

00:42:29.730 --> 00:42:32.920
Now, the residuals are
basically the difference

00:42:32.920 --> 00:42:38.320
between the response value
and the fitted value.

00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:43.960
And this can be expressed
as y minus y hat,

00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:48.370
or I_n minus H times y.

00:42:48.370 --> 00:42:58.700
And it turns out that I_n minus
H is also a projection matrix,

00:42:58.700 --> 00:43:03.950
and it's projecting the data
onto the space orthogonal

00:43:03.950 --> 00:43:06.680
to the column space of x.

00:43:06.680 --> 00:43:11.980
And to show that that's
true, if we consider

00:43:11.980 --> 00:43:16.420
the normal equations, which
are X transpose y minus X beta

00:43:16.420 --> 00:43:20.890
hat equaling 0, that basically
is X transpose epsilon hat

00:43:20.890 --> 00:43:22.310
equals 0.

00:43:22.310 --> 00:43:25.410
And so from the
normal equations,

00:43:25.410 --> 00:43:27.610
we can see that
what they mean is

00:43:27.610 --> 00:43:33.380
they mean that the residual
vector epsilon hat is

00:43:33.380 --> 00:43:36.550
orthogonal to each
of the columns of X.

00:43:36.550 --> 00:43:38.570
You can take any column
in X, multiply that

00:43:38.570 --> 00:43:42.210
by the residual vector,
and get 0 coming out.

00:43:42.210 --> 00:43:47.760
So that's a feature
of the residuals

00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:51.660
as they relate to the
independent variables.

00:43:51.660 --> 00:43:53.940
OK, all right.

00:43:53.940 --> 00:44:00.520
So at this point, we've gone
through really not talking

00:44:00.520 --> 00:44:03.669
about any statistical
properties to specify the betas.

00:44:03.669 --> 00:44:06.210
All we've done is talked-- we've
introduced the least squares

00:44:06.210 --> 00:44:09.770
criterion and said, what
value of the beta vector

00:44:09.770 --> 00:44:13.260
minimizes that least
squares criterion?

00:44:13.260 --> 00:44:17.470
Let's turn to the
Gauss-Markov theorem

00:44:17.470 --> 00:44:22.240
and start introducing some
statistical properties,

00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:24.190
probability properties.

00:44:24.190 --> 00:44:28.945
So with our data, y and X-- yes?

00:44:28.945 --> 00:44:29.445
Yes.

00:44:29.445 --> 00:44:30.361
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:44:36.110 --> 00:44:37.268
PROFESSOR: That epsilon--

00:44:37.268 --> 00:44:38.184
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:44:41.480 --> 00:44:42.752
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:44:42.752 --> 00:44:43.710
Let me go back to that.

00:44:47.830 --> 00:44:53.500
It's that X, the columns
of X, and the column

00:44:53.500 --> 00:44:59.660
vector of the residual are
orthogonal to each other.

00:44:59.660 --> 00:45:04.330
So we're not doing a
projection onto a null space.

00:45:04.330 --> 00:45:11.440
This is just a statement that
those values, or those column

00:45:11.440 --> 00:45:15.160
vectors, are orthogonal
to each other.

00:45:15.160 --> 00:45:22.010
And just to recap, the
epsilon is a projection of y

00:45:22.010 --> 00:45:27.060
onto the space orthogonal
to the column space.

00:45:27.060 --> 00:45:32.788
And y hat is a projection
onto the column space of y.

00:45:32.788 --> 00:45:37.405
And these projections are
all orthogonal projections,

00:45:37.405 --> 00:45:45.740
and so they happen to result in
the projected value epsilon hat

00:45:45.740 --> 00:45:48.770
must be orthogonal to
the column space of X,

00:45:48.770 --> 00:45:53.080
if you project it out.

00:45:53.080 --> 00:45:54.300
OK?

00:45:54.300 --> 00:45:55.130
All right.

00:45:55.130 --> 00:46:02.240
So the Gauss-Markov theorem,
we have data y and X again.

00:46:02.240 --> 00:46:05.810
And now we're going to
think of the observed data,

00:46:05.810 --> 00:46:08.640
little y_1 through
y_n, is actually

00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:12.050
an observation of the
random vector capital

00:46:12.050 --> 00:46:19.610
Y, composed of random
variables Y_1 up to Y_n.

00:46:19.610 --> 00:46:25.120
And the expectation
of this vector

00:46:25.120 --> 00:46:28.740
conditional on the values
of the independent variables

00:46:28.740 --> 00:46:30.680
and their regression
parameters given by X,

00:46:30.680 --> 00:46:36.490
beta-- so the dependent
variable vector

00:46:36.490 --> 00:46:40.880
has expectation
given by the product

00:46:40.880 --> 00:46:43.340
of the independent variables
matrix times the regression

00:46:43.340 --> 00:46:44.750
parameters.

00:46:44.750 --> 00:46:48.425
And the covariance matrix
of Y given X and beta

00:46:48.425 --> 00:46:50.930
is sigma squared
times the identity

00:46:50.930 --> 00:46:54.330
matrix, the n-dimensional
identity matrix.

00:46:54.330 --> 00:46:58.120
So the identity matrix has
1's along the diagonal,

00:46:58.120 --> 00:47:00.480
n-dimensional, and
0's off the diagonal.

00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:06.980
So the variances of the Y's
are the diagonal entries,

00:47:06.980 --> 00:47:08.830
those are all the
same, sigma squared.

00:47:08.830 --> 00:47:13.323
And the covariance between
any two are equal to 0

00:47:13.323 --> 00:47:13.906
conditionally.

00:47:21.530 --> 00:47:25.260
OK, now the
Gauss-Markov theorem.

00:47:25.260 --> 00:47:31.790
This is a terrific result
in linear models theory.

00:47:31.790 --> 00:47:37.790
And it's terrific in terms of
the mathematical content of it.

00:47:37.790 --> 00:47:43.850
I think it's-- for a math class,
it's really a nice theorem

00:47:43.850 --> 00:47:51.110
to introduce you to and
highlight the power of, I

00:47:51.110 --> 00:47:55.570
guess, results that can arise
from applying the theory.

00:47:55.570 --> 00:48:00.120
And so to set this
theorem up, we

00:48:00.120 --> 00:48:05.710
want to think about trying
to estimate some function

00:48:05.710 --> 00:48:07.770
of the regression parameters.

00:48:07.770 --> 00:48:14.060
And so OK, our problem is
with ordinary least squares--

00:48:14.060 --> 00:48:16.300
it was, how do we specify
the regression parameters

00:48:16.300 --> 00:48:18.180
beta_1 through beta_p?

00:48:18.180 --> 00:48:23.510
Let's consider a general
target of interest,

00:48:23.510 --> 00:48:26.660
which is a linear
combination of the betas.

00:48:26.660 --> 00:48:32.090
So we want to predict
a parameter theta which

00:48:32.090 --> 00:48:37.530
is some linear combination
of the regression parameters.

00:48:37.530 --> 00:48:42.000
And because that linear
combination of the regression

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:49.920
parameters corresponds to the
expectation of the response

00:48:49.920 --> 00:48:51.840
variable corresponding
to a given

00:48:51.840 --> 00:48:53.970
row of the independent
variables matrix,

00:48:53.970 --> 00:48:55.690
this is just a
generalization of trying

00:48:55.690 --> 00:48:59.240
to estimate the means
of the regression model

00:48:59.240 --> 00:49:01.410
at different points
in the space,

00:49:01.410 --> 00:49:06.720
or to be estimating other
quantities that might arise.

00:49:06.720 --> 00:49:09.340
So this is really a very
general kind of thing

00:49:09.340 --> 00:49:10.540
to want to estimate.

00:49:10.540 --> 00:49:13.560
It certainly is appropriate
for predictions.

00:49:13.560 --> 00:49:18.530
And if we consider the
least squares estimate

00:49:18.530 --> 00:49:22.760
by just plugging in beta hat
one through beta hat p, solved

00:49:22.760 --> 00:49:28.990
by the least squares,
well, it turns out

00:49:28.990 --> 00:49:36.900
that those are an unbiased
estimator of the parameter

00:49:36.900 --> 00:49:37.812
theta.

00:49:37.812 --> 00:49:39.770
So if we're trying to
estimate this combination

00:49:39.770 --> 00:49:42.580
of these unknown parameters,
you plug in the least squares

00:49:42.580 --> 00:49:47.350
estimate, you're going to get
an estimator that's unbiased.

00:49:47.350 --> 00:49:49.330
Who can tell me
what unbiased is?

00:49:49.330 --> 00:49:54.770
It's probably going to be a new
concept for some people here.

00:49:54.770 --> 00:49:56.000
Anyone?

00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:59.810
OK, well it's a basic
property of estimators

00:49:59.810 --> 00:50:04.800
in statistics where the
expectation of this statistic

00:50:04.800 --> 00:50:06.720
is the true parameter.

00:50:06.720 --> 00:50:10.680
So it doesn't, on average,
probabilistically, it

00:50:10.680 --> 00:50:12.860
doesn't over- or
underestimate the value.

00:50:12.860 --> 00:50:14.740
So that's what unbiased means.

00:50:14.740 --> 00:50:16.520
Now, it's also a
linear estimator

00:50:16.520 --> 00:50:21.270
of theta in terms
of this theta hat

00:50:21.270 --> 00:50:23.810
being a particular
linear combination

00:50:23.810 --> 00:50:26.750
of the dependent variables.

00:50:26.750 --> 00:50:31.350
So with our original
response variable y,

00:50:31.350 --> 00:50:37.510
in the case of y_1 through
y_n, this theta hat is simply

00:50:37.510 --> 00:50:40.530
a linear combination
of all the y's.

00:50:40.530 --> 00:50:42.560
And now why is that true?

00:50:42.560 --> 00:50:49.246
Well, we know that beta hat,
from the normal equations,

00:50:49.246 --> 00:50:52.490
is solved by X transpose
X inverse X transpose y.

00:50:52.490 --> 00:50:56.200
So it's a linear
transform of the y vector.

00:50:56.200 --> 00:50:57.780
So if we take a
linear combination

00:50:57.780 --> 00:51:00.480
of those components, it's also
another linear combination

00:51:00.480 --> 00:51:01.490
of the y vector.

00:51:01.490 --> 00:51:06.090
So this is a linear
function of the underlying--

00:51:06.090 --> 00:51:08.830
of the response variables.

00:51:08.830 --> 00:51:12.130
Now, the Gauss-Markov
theorem says

00:51:12.130 --> 00:51:16.350
that, if the Gauss-Markov
assumptions apply,

00:51:16.350 --> 00:51:20.230
then the estimator theta
has the smallest variance

00:51:20.230 --> 00:51:25.750
amongst all linear unbiased
estimators of theta.

00:51:25.750 --> 00:51:28.910
So it actually is
like the optimal one,

00:51:28.910 --> 00:51:32.070
as long as this is our criteria.

00:51:32.070 --> 00:51:36.340
And this is really a
very powerful result.

00:51:36.340 --> 00:51:42.482
And to prove it, it's very easy.

00:51:42.482 --> 00:51:45.610
Let's see.

00:51:45.610 --> 00:51:47.750
Actually, these notes are
going to be distributed.

00:51:47.750 --> 00:51:53.890
So I'm going to go through
this very, very quickly

00:51:53.890 --> 00:51:56.300
and come back to it later
if we have more time.

00:51:56.300 --> 00:52:01.670
But you basically-- the
argument for the proof here

00:52:01.670 --> 00:52:05.750
is you consider another
linear estimate which

00:52:05.750 --> 00:52:08.410
is also an unbiased estimate.

00:52:08.410 --> 00:52:13.540
So let's consider a competitor
to the least squares value

00:52:13.540 --> 00:52:17.710
and then look at the difference
between that estimator

00:52:17.710 --> 00:52:20.960
and theta hat.

00:52:20.960 --> 00:52:27.880
And so that can be characterized
as basically this vector,

00:52:27.880 --> 00:52:29.280
f transpose y.

00:52:32.010 --> 00:52:35.970
And this difference
in the estimates

00:52:35.970 --> 00:52:40.030
must have expectation 0.

00:52:40.030 --> 00:52:42.790
So basically, if we look at--
if theta tilde is unbiased,

00:52:42.790 --> 00:52:46.200
then this expression
here is going

00:52:46.200 --> 00:52:50.580
to be equal to zero,
which means that f--

00:52:50.580 --> 00:52:57.100
the difference in
these two estimators, f

00:52:57.100 --> 00:52:59.230
defines the difference
in the two estimators--

00:52:59.230 --> 00:53:02.120
has to be orthogonal to
the column space of x.

00:53:02.120 --> 00:53:13.350
And with this
result, one then uses

00:53:13.350 --> 00:53:17.530
this orthogonality of
f and d to evaluate

00:53:17.530 --> 00:53:20.040
the variance of theta tilde.

00:53:20.040 --> 00:53:23.760
And in this proof, the
mathematical argument

00:53:23.760 --> 00:53:29.535
here is really something--
I should put some asterisks

00:53:29.535 --> 00:53:31.140
on a few lines here.

00:53:31.140 --> 00:53:35.850
This expression here is
actually very important.

00:53:35.850 --> 00:53:40.120
We're basically looking
at the decomposition

00:53:40.120 --> 00:53:43.250
of the variance to
be the variance of b

00:53:43.250 --> 00:53:46.890
transpose y, which is
the variance of the sum

00:53:46.890 --> 00:53:49.350
of these two random variables.

00:53:49.350 --> 00:53:55.880
So the page before
basically defined d and f

00:53:55.880 --> 00:53:57.560
such that this is true.

00:53:57.560 --> 00:54:02.370
Now when you consider
the variance of a sum,

00:54:02.370 --> 00:54:05.870
it's not the sum
of the variances.

00:54:05.870 --> 00:54:09.730
It's the sum of the
variances plus twice

00:54:09.730 --> 00:54:12.170
the sum of the covariances.

00:54:12.170 --> 00:54:18.795
And so when you are
calculating variances

00:54:18.795 --> 00:54:21.430
of sums of random variables,
you have to really keep

00:54:21.430 --> 00:54:24.180
track of the covariance terms.

00:54:24.180 --> 00:54:26.200
In this case, this
argument shows

00:54:26.200 --> 00:54:29.320
that the covariance
terms are, in fact, 0,

00:54:29.320 --> 00:54:32.804
and you get the
result popping out.

00:54:32.804 --> 00:54:38.890
But that's really a-- in
an econometrics class,

00:54:38.890 --> 00:54:42.934
they'll talk about BLUE
estimates of regression,

00:54:42.934 --> 00:54:45.100
or the BLUE property of the
least squares estimates.

00:54:45.100 --> 00:54:47.260
That's where that comes from.

00:54:47.260 --> 00:54:53.090
All right, so let's now consider
generalizing from Gauss-Markov

00:54:53.090 --> 00:55:04.660
to allow for unequal variances
and possibly correlated

00:55:04.660 --> 00:55:08.710
nonzero covariances
between the components.

00:55:08.710 --> 00:55:13.150
And in this case,
the regression model

00:55:13.150 --> 00:55:14.560
has the same linear set up.

00:55:14.560 --> 00:55:16.970
The only difference
is the expectation

00:55:16.970 --> 00:55:19.730
of the residual
vector is still 0.

00:55:19.730 --> 00:55:22.920
But the covariance matrix
of the residual vector

00:55:22.920 --> 00:55:26.330
is sigma squared,
a single parameter,

00:55:26.330 --> 00:55:29.850
times let's say capital sigma.

00:55:29.850 --> 00:55:33.530
And we'll assume here
that this capital sigma

00:55:33.530 --> 00:55:39.000
matrix is a known n by n
positive definite matrix

00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:41.204
specifying relative
variances and correlations

00:55:41.204 --> 00:55:42.245
between the observations.

00:55:47.570 --> 00:55:48.070
OK.

00:55:51.500 --> 00:55:59.392
Well, in order to solve
for regression estimates

00:55:59.392 --> 00:56:04.400
under these generalized
Gauss-Markov assumptions,

00:56:04.400 --> 00:56:08.750
we can transform the
data Y, X to Y star

00:56:08.750 --> 00:56:13.170
equals sigma to the
minus 1/2 y and X

00:56:13.170 --> 00:56:17.670
to X star, which is
sigma to the minus 1/2 x.

00:56:17.670 --> 00:56:24.470
And this model then becomes
a model, a linear regression

00:56:24.470 --> 00:56:29.640
model, in terms of
Y star and X star.

00:56:29.640 --> 00:56:33.460
We're basically multiplying
this regression model by sigma

00:56:33.460 --> 00:56:36.320
to the minus 1/2 across.

00:56:36.320 --> 00:56:43.700
And epsilon star actually
has a covariance matrix

00:56:43.700 --> 00:56:45.770
equal to sigma squared
times the identity.

00:56:45.770 --> 00:56:50.380
So if we just take a
linear transformation

00:56:50.380 --> 00:56:56.260
of the original data,
we get a representation

00:56:56.260 --> 00:56:57.890
of the regression
model that satisfies

00:56:57.890 --> 00:57:00.880
the original
Gauss-Markov assumptions.

00:57:00.880 --> 00:57:03.410
And what we had to
do was basically

00:57:03.410 --> 00:57:05.920
do a linear transformation
that makes the response

00:57:05.920 --> 00:57:10.500
variables all have constant
variance and be uncorrelated.

00:57:13.980 --> 00:57:19.740
So with that, we then have the
least squares estimate of beta

00:57:19.740 --> 00:57:23.850
is the least squares, the
ordinary least squares,

00:57:23.850 --> 00:57:26.250
in terms of Y star and X star.

00:57:26.250 --> 00:57:31.910
And so plugging that in, we then
have X star transpose X star

00:57:31.910 --> 00:57:34.310
inverse X star transpose Y star.

00:57:34.310 --> 00:57:37.130
And if you multiply through,
that's how the formula changes.

00:57:41.600 --> 00:57:45.600
So this formula characterizing
the least squares estimate

00:57:45.600 --> 00:57:48.850
under this generalized
set of assumptions

00:57:48.850 --> 00:57:55.010
highlights what you
need to do to be

00:57:55.010 --> 00:57:56.900
able to apply that theorem.

00:57:56.900 --> 00:58:03.140
So with response values that
have very large variances,

00:58:03.140 --> 00:58:07.540
you basically want to discount
those by the sigma inverse.

00:58:10.275 --> 00:58:14.280
And that's part of the way in
which these generalized least

00:58:14.280 --> 00:58:15.940
squares work.

00:58:15.940 --> 00:58:17.120
All right.

00:58:17.120 --> 00:58:19.960
So now let's turn to
distribution theory

00:58:19.960 --> 00:58:21.683
for normal regression models.

00:58:25.480 --> 00:58:28.820
Let's assume that
the residuals are

00:58:28.820 --> 00:58:32.175
normals with mean 0 and
variance sigma squared.

00:58:37.880 --> 00:58:42.360
OK, conditioning on the values
of the independent variable,

00:58:42.360 --> 00:58:44.240
the Y's, the response
variables, are

00:58:44.240 --> 00:58:49.932
going to be independent
over the index i.

00:58:49.932 --> 00:58:51.890
They're not going to be
identically distributed

00:58:51.890 --> 00:58:54.920
because they have
different means, mu_i

00:58:54.920 --> 00:58:58.820
for the dependent
variable Y_i, but they

00:58:58.820 --> 00:59:02.060
will have a constant variance.

00:59:02.060 --> 00:59:10.930
And what we can do is
basically condition on X, beta,

00:59:10.930 --> 00:59:14.320
and sigma squared
and then represent

00:59:14.320 --> 00:59:20.280
this model in terms of the
distribution of the epsilons.

00:59:20.280 --> 00:59:23.140
So if we're conditioning
on x and beta,

00:59:23.140 --> 00:59:27.950
this X beta is a constant,
known, we've conditioned on it.

00:59:27.950 --> 00:59:31.520
And the remaining uncertainty
is in the residual vector,

00:59:31.520 --> 00:59:36.590
which is assumed to
be all independent

00:59:36.590 --> 00:59:39.064
and identically distributed
normal random variables.

00:59:39.064 --> 00:59:40.480
Now, this is the
first time you'll

00:59:40.480 --> 00:59:48.400
see this notation, capital N sub
little n, for a random vector.

00:59:48.400 --> 00:59:53.090
It's a multivariate
normal random variable

00:59:53.090 --> 00:59:57.540
where you consider an n-vector
where each component is

00:59:57.540 --> 01:00:00.340
normally distributed,
with mean given

01:00:00.340 --> 01:00:04.090
by some corresponding
mean vector,

01:00:04.090 --> 01:00:10.200
and a covariance matrix
given by a covariance matrix.

01:00:10.200 --> 01:00:16.150
In terms of independent and
identically distributed values,

01:00:16.150 --> 01:00:21.250
the probability structure
here is totally well-defined.

01:00:21.250 --> 01:00:24.760
Anyone here who's taken a
beginning probability class

01:00:24.760 --> 01:00:26.420
knows what the
density function is

01:00:26.420 --> 01:00:28.340
for this multivariate
normal distribution

01:00:28.340 --> 01:00:32.180
because it's the product
of the independent density

01:00:32.180 --> 01:00:34.960
functions for the
independent components,

01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:37.170
because they're all
independent random variables.

01:00:37.170 --> 01:00:40.190
So this multivariate
normal random vector

01:00:40.190 --> 01:00:45.100
has a density function
which you can write down,

01:00:45.100 --> 01:00:47.266
given your first
probability class.

01:00:51.090 --> 01:00:54.960
OK, here I'm just
highlighting or defining

01:00:54.960 --> 01:01:01.670
the mu vector for the means
of the cases of the data.

01:01:01.670 --> 01:01:06.210
And the covariance matrix
sigma is this diagonal matrix.

01:01:08.940 --> 01:01:19.450
And so basically sigma_(i,j)
is equal to sigma squared times

01:01:19.450 --> 01:01:23.790
the Kronecker delta
for the (i,j) element.

01:01:23.790 --> 01:01:28.940
Now what we want to do
is, under the assumptions

01:01:28.940 --> 01:01:33.845
of normally
distributed residuals,

01:01:33.845 --> 01:01:38.700
to solve for the distribution
of the least squares estimators.

01:01:38.700 --> 01:01:41.550
We want to know, basically,
what kind of distribution

01:01:41.550 --> 01:01:42.819
does it have?

01:01:42.819 --> 01:01:44.360
Because what we want
to be able to do

01:01:44.360 --> 01:01:46.330
is to determine
whether estimates

01:01:46.330 --> 01:01:49.020
are particularly large or not.

01:01:49.020 --> 01:01:50.850
And maybe there's
no structure at all

01:01:50.850 --> 01:01:55.080
and the regression
parameters are 0 so

01:01:55.080 --> 01:01:57.510
that there's no dependence
on a given factor.

01:01:57.510 --> 01:02:00.400
And we need to be able to
judge how significant that is.

01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:03.290
So we need to know what
the distribution is

01:02:03.290 --> 01:02:06.410
of our least squares estimate.

01:02:06.410 --> 01:02:09.160
So what we're going to do
is apply moment generating

01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:11.540
functions to derive the
joint distribution of y

01:02:11.540 --> 01:02:13.574
and the joint
distribution of beta hat.

01:02:17.060 --> 01:02:22.560
And so Choongbum introduced
the moment generating function

01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:26.821
for individual random variables
for single-variate random

01:02:26.821 --> 01:02:27.320
variables.

01:02:27.320 --> 01:02:30.100
For n-variate
random variables, we

01:02:30.100 --> 01:02:35.190
can define the moment generating
function of the Y vector

01:02:35.190 --> 01:02:38.990
to be the expectation of
e to the t transpose Y.

01:02:38.990 --> 01:02:41.840
So t is an argument of the
moment generating function.

01:02:41.840 --> 01:02:43.660
It's another n-vector.

01:02:43.660 --> 01:02:46.660
And it's equal to the
expectation of e to the t_1 Y_1

01:02:46.660 --> 01:02:48.840
plus t_2 Y_2 up to t_n Y_n.

01:02:48.840 --> 01:02:53.930
So this is a very
simple definition.

01:02:53.930 --> 01:02:58.260
Because of independence,
the expectation

01:02:58.260 --> 01:03:02.380
of the products, or
this exponential sum

01:03:02.380 --> 01:03:05.240
is the product of
the exponentials.

01:03:05.240 --> 01:03:08.840
And so this moment
generating function is simply

01:03:08.840 --> 01:03:12.250
the product of the moment
generating functions for Y_1

01:03:12.250 --> 01:03:15.190
up through Y_n.

01:03:15.190 --> 01:03:18.180
And I think-- I don't know if
it was in the first problem set

01:03:18.180 --> 01:03:22.652
or in the first lecture, but e
to the t_i mu_i plus a half t_i

01:03:22.652 --> 01:03:24.610
squared sigma squared
was the moment generating

01:03:24.610 --> 01:03:28.310
function for the
single univariate

01:03:28.310 --> 01:03:30.710
normal random variable,
mean mu_i and variance sigma

01:03:30.710 --> 01:03:32.340
squared.

01:03:32.340 --> 01:03:36.780
And so if we have n of
these, we take their product.

01:03:36.780 --> 01:03:39.720
And the moment
generating function

01:03:39.720 --> 01:03:44.700
for y is simply e to the
t transpose mu plus 1/2

01:03:44.700 --> 01:03:48.090
t transpose sigma t.

01:03:48.090 --> 01:03:53.020
And so for this multivariate
normal distribution,

01:03:53.020 --> 01:03:57.630
this is its moment
generating function.

01:03:57.630 --> 01:04:06.070
And this happens to be--
the distribution of y

01:04:06.070 --> 01:04:10.165
is a multivariate normal with
mean mu and covariance matrix

01:04:10.165 --> 01:04:11.940
sigma.

01:04:11.940 --> 01:04:16.080
So a fact that
we're going to use

01:04:16.080 --> 01:04:19.970
is that if we're working with
multivariate normal random

01:04:19.970 --> 01:04:23.470
variables, this is the structure
of their moment generating

01:04:23.470 --> 01:04:24.520
functions.

01:04:24.520 --> 01:04:26.870
And so if we solve for
the moment generation

01:04:26.870 --> 01:04:29.280
function of some
other item of interest

01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:31.840
and recognize that
it has the same form,

01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:35.237
we can conclude that it's also
a multivariate normal random

01:04:35.237 --> 01:04:35.736
variable.

01:04:39.440 --> 01:04:41.330
So let's do that.

01:04:41.330 --> 01:04:44.720
Let's solve for the
moment generation

01:04:44.720 --> 01:04:48.120
function of the least
squares estimate, beta hat.

01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:50.980
Now rather than dealing
with an n-vector,

01:04:50.980 --> 01:04:55.212
we're dealing with a p-vector
of the betas, beta hats.

01:04:55.212 --> 01:04:57.170
And this is simply the
definition of the moment

01:04:57.170 --> 01:05:00.240
generating function.

01:05:00.240 --> 01:05:06.380
If we plug in for basically
what the functional form is

01:05:06.380 --> 01:05:09.160
for the ordinary least
squares estimates

01:05:09.160 --> 01:05:13.960
and how they depend on
the underlying Y, then we

01:05:13.960 --> 01:05:20.480
basically-- OK, we have
A equal to, essentially,

01:05:20.480 --> 01:05:22.950
the linear projection of Y.
That gives us the least squares

01:05:22.950 --> 01:05:24.530
estimate.

01:05:24.530 --> 01:05:28.800
And then we can say that
this moment generating

01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:34.723
function for beta hat is
equal to the expectation of e

01:05:34.723 --> 01:05:40.650
to the t transpose Y, where
little t is A transpose tau.

01:05:40.650 --> 01:05:41.960
Well, we know what this is.

01:05:41.960 --> 01:05:43.543
This is the moment
generating function

01:05:43.543 --> 01:05:50.080
of X-- sorry, of Y-- evaluated
at the vector little t.

01:05:50.080 --> 01:05:54.620
So we just need to plug in
little t, that expression

01:05:54.620 --> 01:05:56.280
A transpose tau.

01:05:56.280 --> 01:05:59.370
So let's do that.

01:05:59.370 --> 01:06:03.580
And you do that and it turns
out to be e to the t transpose

01:06:03.580 --> 01:06:06.324
mu plus that.

01:06:06.324 --> 01:06:13.450
And we go through a
number of calculations.

01:06:13.450 --> 01:06:16.310
And at the end of the day, we
get that the moment generating

01:06:16.310 --> 01:06:20.580
function is just e to the tau
transpose beta plus a 1/2 tau

01:06:20.580 --> 01:06:23.740
transpose this matrix tau.

01:06:23.740 --> 01:06:26.050
And that is the moment
generation function

01:06:26.050 --> 01:06:28.490
of a multivariate normal.

01:06:28.490 --> 01:06:32.280
So these few lines that you
can go through after class

01:06:32.280 --> 01:06:34.320
basically solve for
the moment generating

01:06:34.320 --> 01:06:35.960
function of beta hat.

01:06:35.960 --> 01:06:39.456
And because we can
recognize this as the MGF

01:06:39.456 --> 01:06:44.960
of a multivariate normal, we
know that that's-- beta hat is

01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:48.140
a multivariate normal,
with mean the true beta,

01:06:48.140 --> 01:06:52.610
and covariance matrix given by
the object in square brackets

01:06:52.610 --> 01:06:54.390
there.

01:06:54.390 --> 01:07:01.590
OK, so this is
essentially the conclusion

01:07:01.590 --> 01:07:05.040
of that previous analysis.

01:07:05.040 --> 01:07:08.410
The marginal distribution
of each of the beta hats

01:07:08.410 --> 01:07:13.490
is given by beta hat-- by a
univariate normal distribution

01:07:13.490 --> 01:07:18.490
with mean beta_j and variance
equal to the diagonal.

01:07:18.490 --> 01:07:25.190
Now at this point, saying
that is like an assertion.

01:07:25.190 --> 01:07:28.750
But one can actually
prove that very easily,

01:07:28.750 --> 01:07:33.290
given this sequence of argument.

01:07:33.290 --> 01:07:36.622
And can anyone tell
me why this is true?

01:07:43.080 --> 01:07:44.390
Let me tell you.

01:07:44.390 --> 01:07:47.850
If you consider plugging in
the moment generating function,

01:07:47.850 --> 01:07:53.990
the value tau, where only
the j-th entry is non-zero,

01:07:53.990 --> 01:07:56.120
then you have the moment
generating function

01:07:56.120 --> 01:07:59.310
of the j-th component
of beta hat.

01:07:59.310 --> 01:08:03.880
And that's a Gaussian
moment generating function.

01:08:03.880 --> 01:08:08.190
So the marginal distribution of
the j-th component is normal.

01:08:08.190 --> 01:08:10.550
So you get that
almost for free from

01:08:10.550 --> 01:08:13.680
this multivariate analysis.

01:08:13.680 --> 01:08:18.014
And so there's no hand waving
going on in having that result.

01:08:18.014 --> 01:08:20.229
This actually follows
directly from the moment

01:08:20.229 --> 01:08:22.760
generating functions.

01:08:22.760 --> 01:08:26.870
OK, let's now turn
to another topic.

01:08:26.870 --> 01:08:32.200
Related, but it's the
QR decomposition of X.

01:08:32.200 --> 01:08:36.870
So we have-- with our
independent variables

01:08:36.870 --> 01:08:41.630
X, we want to express
this as a product

01:08:41.630 --> 01:08:46.609
of an orthonormal matrix
Q which is n by p,

01:08:46.609 --> 01:08:51.684
and an upper
triangular matrix R.

01:08:51.684 --> 01:08:59.750
So it turns out that any
matrix, n by p matrix,

01:08:59.750 --> 01:09:02.130
can be expressed in this form.

01:09:02.130 --> 01:09:07.260
And we'll quickly show you
how that can be accomplished.

01:09:07.260 --> 01:09:10.180
We can accomplish
that by conducting

01:09:10.180 --> 01:09:13.479
a Gram-Schmidt
orthonormalization

01:09:13.479 --> 01:09:17.580
of the independent
variables matrix X.

01:09:17.580 --> 01:09:21.540
And let's see.

01:09:21.540 --> 01:09:26.689
So if we define R, the upper
triangular matrix in the QR

01:09:26.689 --> 01:09:31.424
decomposition, to have
0's off the diagonal below

01:09:31.424 --> 01:09:35.710
and then possibly nonzero
value along the diagonal

01:09:35.710 --> 01:09:41.500
into the right, we're just
going to solve for Q and R

01:09:41.500 --> 01:09:45.260
through this
Gram-Schmidt process.

01:09:45.260 --> 01:09:50.439
So the first column of X is
equal to the first column

01:09:50.439 --> 01:09:57.430
of Q times the first
element, the top left corner

01:09:57.430 --> 01:10:00.240
of the matrix R.

01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:08.130
And if we take the cross product
of that vector with itself,

01:10:08.130 --> 01:10:14.600
then we get this expression
for r_(1,1) squared--

01:10:14.600 --> 01:10:18.270
we can basically solve for
r_(1,1) as the square root

01:10:18.270 --> 01:10:19.590
of this dot product.

01:10:19.590 --> 01:10:22.920
And Q_Q_[1] is simply the first
column of X divided by that

01:10:22.920 --> 01:10:23.500
square root.

01:10:23.500 --> 01:10:27.260
So this first element
of the Q matrix

01:10:27.260 --> 01:10:32.210
and the first element r, this
can be solved for right away.

01:10:32.210 --> 01:10:38.100
Then let's solve for
the second column of Q

01:10:38.100 --> 01:10:43.310
and the second column
of the R matrix.

01:10:43.310 --> 01:10:46.860
Well, X_X_[2], the second
column of the X matrix,

01:10:46.860 --> 01:10:56.090
is the first column
of Q times r_(1,2),

01:10:56.090 --> 01:10:58.614
plus the second column
of Q times r_(2,2).

01:11:02.250 --> 01:11:09.300
And if we multiply this
expression by Q_Q_[1] transpose,

01:11:09.300 --> 01:11:15.720
then we basically get this
expression for r_(1,2).

01:11:19.780 --> 01:11:24.240
So we actually have
just solved for r_(1,2).

01:11:24.240 --> 01:11:35.910
And Q_Q_[2] is solved for by
the arguments given here.

01:11:35.910 --> 01:11:41.070
So basically, we successively
are orthogonalizing

01:11:41.070 --> 01:11:43.480
columns of X to the
previous columns of X

01:11:43.480 --> 01:11:45.850
through this
Gram-Schmidt process.

01:11:45.850 --> 01:11:48.460
And it basically can be repeated
through all the columns.

01:11:51.030 --> 01:11:55.410
Now with this QR
decomposition, what we get

01:11:55.410 --> 01:12:01.470
is a really nice form for
the least squares estimate.

01:12:01.470 --> 01:12:07.080
Basically, it simplifies to the
inverse of R times Q transpose

01:12:07.080 --> 01:12:08.220
y.

01:12:08.220 --> 01:12:15.490
And this basically
means that you

01:12:15.490 --> 01:12:19.720
can solve for least squares
estimates by calculating the QR

01:12:19.720 --> 01:12:22.150
decomposition, which is a
very simple linear algebra

01:12:22.150 --> 01:12:25.890
operation, and then just do
a couple of matrix products

01:12:25.890 --> 01:12:31.310
to get the-- well, you do have
to do a matrix inverse with R

01:12:31.310 --> 01:12:33.730
to get that out.

01:12:33.730 --> 01:12:37.810
And the covariance
matrix of beta hat

01:12:37.810 --> 01:12:44.480
is equal to sigma squared
X transpose X inverse.

01:12:44.480 --> 01:12:53.330
And in terms of the covariance
matrix, what is implicit here

01:12:53.330 --> 01:12:55.870
but you should make
explicit in your study,

01:12:55.870 --> 01:13:06.190
is if you consider taking a
matrix, R inverse Q transpose

01:13:06.190 --> 01:13:11.160
times y, the only thing that's
random there is that y vector,

01:13:11.160 --> 01:13:11.660
OK?

01:13:11.660 --> 01:13:16.720
The covariance of a matrix
times a random vector

01:13:16.720 --> 01:13:19.770
is that matrix
times the covariance

01:13:19.770 --> 01:13:22.960
of the vector times the
transpose of the matrix.

01:13:22.960 --> 01:13:26.770
So if you take a
matrix transformation

01:13:26.770 --> 01:13:30.510
of a random vector,
then the covariance

01:13:30.510 --> 01:13:33.660
of that transformation
has that form.

01:13:33.660 --> 01:13:41.110
So that's where this covariance
matrix is coming into play.

01:13:41.110 --> 01:13:44.410
And from the MGF, the
moment generating function,

01:13:44.410 --> 01:13:48.660
for the least squares
estimate, this basically

01:13:48.660 --> 01:13:50.930
comes out of the moment
generating function definition

01:13:50.930 --> 01:13:51.943
as well.

01:13:51.943 --> 01:13:56.480
And if we take X
transpose X, plug

01:13:56.480 --> 01:14:01.864
in the QR decomposition,
only the R's play out,

01:14:01.864 --> 01:14:03.600
giving you that.

01:14:03.600 --> 01:14:05.870
Now, this also gives
us a very nice form

01:14:05.870 --> 01:14:10.450
for the hat matrix,
which turns out

01:14:10.450 --> 01:14:13.490
to just be Q times Q transpose.

01:14:13.490 --> 01:14:20.370
So that's a very simple form.

01:14:25.290 --> 01:14:28.160
So now with the
distribution theory,

01:14:28.160 --> 01:14:35.190
this next section is
going to actually prove

01:14:35.190 --> 01:14:37.970
what's really a
fundamental result

01:14:37.970 --> 01:14:40.380
about normal linear
regression models.

01:14:40.380 --> 01:14:45.210
And I'm going to go through
this somewhat quickly just

01:14:45.210 --> 01:14:49.290
so that we cover what the
main ideas are of the theorem.

01:14:49.290 --> 01:14:53.930
But the details, I think,
are very straightforward.

01:14:53.930 --> 01:14:57.250
And these course notes
that will be posted online

01:14:57.250 --> 01:14:59.370
will go through the various
steps of the analysis.

01:15:03.390 --> 01:15:07.160
OK, so there's an
important theorem here

01:15:07.160 --> 01:15:11.660
which is for any
matrix A, m by n,

01:15:11.660 --> 01:15:15.860
you consider transforming
the random vector y

01:15:15.860 --> 01:15:23.600
by this matrix A. It is
also a random normal vector.

01:15:23.600 --> 01:15:26.980
And its distribution
is going to have

01:15:26.980 --> 01:15:30.090
a mean and covariance
matrix given

01:15:30.090 --> 01:15:35.390
by mu_z and sigma_z, which have
this simple expression in terms

01:15:35.390 --> 01:15:38.710
of the matrix A and
the underlying means

01:15:38.710 --> 01:15:40.995
and covariances of y.

01:15:44.880 --> 01:15:48.620
OK, earlier we actually
applied this theorem

01:15:48.620 --> 01:15:53.260
with A corresponding to the
matrix that generates the least

01:15:53.260 --> 01:15:54.920
squares estimates.

01:15:54.920 --> 01:15:57.900
So with A equal to X
transpose X inverse,

01:15:57.900 --> 01:16:01.060
we actually previously went
through the solution for what's

01:16:01.060 --> 01:16:04.040
the distribution of beta hat.

01:16:04.040 --> 01:16:06.960
And with any other
matrix A, we can

01:16:06.960 --> 01:16:09.815
go through the same analysis
and get the distribution.

01:16:13.820 --> 01:16:20.690
So if we do that here,
well, we can actually

01:16:20.690 --> 01:16:22.890
prove this important
theorem, which

01:16:22.890 --> 01:16:27.335
says that with least
squares estimates

01:16:27.335 --> 01:16:33.670
of normal linear regression
models, our least

01:16:33.670 --> 01:16:40.050
squares estimate beta hat and
our residual vector epsilon hat

01:16:40.050 --> 01:16:43.040
are independent
random variables.

01:16:43.040 --> 01:16:48.520
So when we construct
these statistics,

01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:51.860
they are statistically
independent of each other.

01:16:51.860 --> 01:16:57.580
And the distribution of beta
hat is multivariate normal.

01:16:57.580 --> 01:17:04.730
The sum of the squared
residuals is, in fact,

01:17:04.730 --> 01:17:09.660
a multiple of a chi-squared
random variable.

01:17:09.660 --> 01:17:16.010
Now who in here can tell me what
a chi-squared random variable

01:17:16.010 --> 01:17:17.405
is?

01:17:17.405 --> 01:17:18.335
Anyone?

01:17:18.335 --> 01:17:19.251
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

01:17:21.590 --> 01:17:23.010
PROFESSOR: Yes, that's right.

01:17:23.010 --> 01:17:25.610
So a chi-squared random variable
with one degree of freedom

01:17:25.610 --> 01:17:29.652
is a squared normal zero
one random variable.

01:17:29.652 --> 01:17:31.360
A chi-squared with
two degrees of freedom

01:17:31.360 --> 01:17:36.420
is the sum of two independent
normals, zero one, squared.

01:17:36.420 --> 01:17:43.000
And so the sum of n squared
residuals is, in fact,

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:48.182
an n minus p chi-squared random
variable scale it by sigma

01:17:48.182 --> 01:17:49.420
squared.

01:17:49.420 --> 01:17:55.870
And for each component
j, if we take

01:17:55.870 --> 01:18:01.080
the difference between the least
squares estimate beta hat j

01:18:01.080 --> 01:18:04.810
and beta_j and divide
through by this estimate

01:18:04.810 --> 01:18:12.320
of the standard
deviation of that, then

01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:15.740
that will, in fact, have a
t distribution on n minus p

01:18:15.740 --> 01:18:17.280
degrees of freedom.

01:18:17.280 --> 01:18:25.040
And let's see, a t distribution
in probability theory

01:18:25.040 --> 01:18:35.684
is the ratio of a normal random
variable to an independent chi

01:18:35.684 --> 01:18:38.100
squared random variable, or
the root of an independent chi

01:18:38.100 --> 01:18:39.210
squared random variable.

01:18:39.210 --> 01:18:45.780
So basically these
properties characterize

01:18:45.780 --> 01:18:50.970
our regression parameter
estimates and t statistics

01:18:50.970 --> 01:18:54.780
for those estimates.

01:18:54.780 --> 01:18:59.490
Now, OK, in the
course notes, there's

01:18:59.490 --> 01:19:01.670
a moderately long proof.

01:19:01.670 --> 01:19:05.320
But all the details
are given, and I'll

01:19:05.320 --> 01:19:08.110
be happy to go through any
of those details with people

01:19:08.110 --> 01:19:11.050
during office hours.

01:19:11.050 --> 01:19:19.500
Let me just push
on to-- let's see.

01:19:19.500 --> 01:19:23.091
We have maybe two minutes
left in the class.

01:19:25.860 --> 01:19:32.440
Let me just talk about
maximum likelihood estimation.

01:19:32.440 --> 01:19:37.850
And in fitting models
and statistics,

01:19:37.850 --> 01:19:41.030
maximum likelihood estimation
comes up again and again.

01:19:41.030 --> 01:19:45.295
And with normal linear
regression models,

01:19:45.295 --> 01:19:47.880
it turns out that ordinary
least squares estimate

01:19:47.880 --> 01:19:51.690
are, in fact, our maximum
likelihood estimates.

01:19:51.690 --> 01:19:57.570
And what we want to do
with a maximum likelihood

01:19:57.570 --> 01:20:02.000
is to maximize.

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:05.640
We want to define the
likelihood function, which

01:20:05.640 --> 01:20:09.290
is the density function
for the data given

01:20:09.290 --> 01:20:12.110
the unknown parameters.

01:20:12.110 --> 01:20:16.390
And this density
function is simply

01:20:16.390 --> 01:20:18.720
the density function for a
multivariate normal random

01:20:18.720 --> 01:20:20.310
variable.

01:20:20.310 --> 01:20:24.630
And the maximum
likelihood estimates

01:20:24.630 --> 01:20:28.120
are the estimates of the
underlying parameters

01:20:28.120 --> 01:20:31.650
that basically maximize
the density function.

01:20:31.650 --> 01:20:34.200
So it's the values of
the underlying parameters

01:20:34.200 --> 01:20:37.130
that make the data that was
observed the most likely.

01:20:40.520 --> 01:20:49.110
And if you plug in the values
of the density function,

01:20:49.110 --> 01:20:53.680
basically we have these
independent random variables,

01:20:53.680 --> 01:21:00.540
Y_i, whose product
is the joint density.

01:21:00.540 --> 01:21:05.466
The likelihood
function turns out

01:21:05.466 --> 01:21:11.260
to be basically a function of
the least squares criterion.

01:21:11.260 --> 01:21:14.980
So if you fit models
by least squares,

01:21:14.980 --> 01:21:18.472
you're consistent with doing
something decent in at least

01:21:18.472 --> 01:21:20.180
applying the maximum
likelihood principle

01:21:20.180 --> 01:21:23.720
if you had a normal
linear regression model.

01:21:23.720 --> 01:21:31.730
And it's useful to know when
your statistical estimation

01:21:31.730 --> 01:21:37.230
algorithms are consistent
with certain principles

01:21:37.230 --> 01:21:41.620
like maximum likelihood
estimation or others.

01:21:41.620 --> 01:21:43.930
So let me, I guess,
finish there.

01:21:43.930 --> 01:21:49.100
And next time, I will
just talk a little bit

01:21:49.100 --> 01:21:52.780
about generalized M estimators.

01:21:52.780 --> 01:21:55.160
Those provide a
class of estimators

01:21:55.160 --> 01:22:04.420
that can be used for
finding robust estimates

01:22:04.420 --> 01:22:08.290
and also quantile estimates
of regression parameters

01:22:08.290 --> 01:22:12.320
which are very interesting.

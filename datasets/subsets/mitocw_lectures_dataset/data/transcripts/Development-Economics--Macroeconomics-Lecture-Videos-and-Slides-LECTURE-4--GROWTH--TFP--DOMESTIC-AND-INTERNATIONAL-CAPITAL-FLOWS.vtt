00:00:28.016 --> 00:00:33.070
PROFESSOR: So today is the
fourth and last lecture

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.640
on the sort of
microfounded macro models.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.700
And then next
class, we will turn

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:45.640
to a section on measurement,
which is like a halfway point,

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.190
or not really, in terms of
total number of lectures.

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.720
But we'll get into them--
to the micro evidence.

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.540
I must say, this is sometime--

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.140
I said this last time-- in
reverse of what I sometimes do.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.440
I often start with the
micro stuff and build it up.

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.150
But this isn't a bad
idea, because you'll

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:09.070
get to see this way how
different assumptions matter

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:11.180
within each of these
models as you compare

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:12.430
the predicted solutions.

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:17.590
So it hopefully heightens your
sensitivity to assumptions.

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:19.990
And then we'll get
into the microdata

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.570
and really scrutinize
what we see there.

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:28.510
This paper, in particular,
is part of that conversation.

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:30.580
The way it's organized
in terms of the lectures

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.840
is this paper features
mostly something

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.540
other than limited commitment.

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:42.340
Almost every single model has
had sort of very limited credit

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.360
or financing constraints,
collateral constraints,

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:52.060
basically putting a damper
on sudden transitions

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.150
and generating growth paths.

00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:00.460
And here, we're going to
be looking at transition

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.362
somewhat-- also, steady states.

00:02:02.362 --> 00:02:03.820
The main thing is
we're going to be

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:09.940
featuring on other alternative
underpinnings of the models--

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.850
costly state verification,
adverse selection,

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:14.530
moral hazard.

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.600
Again, the irony, for
those of you coming down

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.370
from the advanced
macro class, is

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:26.410
that Alp was featuring costly
state verification up there

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:27.570
early in a lecture.

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:32.200
And these things
are somehow related,

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.860
in the sense that the dynamics
that are created with the debt

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.760
contracts and so on have
to do with what you assume

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.840
about the information structure,
as well as adverse selection

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.280
and so on.

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.460
So you'll be perhaps
a little relieved

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.500
to know there isn't
as much material

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.090
on the front end of this
lecture as there was last time.

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.210
That's kind of a sad
comment on the literature.

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:06.390
Almost everybody assumes
limited commitment,

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.930
so there really wasn't
much to choose from.

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:14.640
We sort of scoured the earth
to find some relevant papers

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.250
in this genre.

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.610
So there's three,
and the third one

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:24.090
is what I'm going to focus
my attention on, the tree, so

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:25.770
to speak, of the lecture.

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:28.770
And now we'll look
at several trees.

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:31.420
The first two are
a bit different.

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.510
This one is Greenwood,
Sanchez, and Wang--

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.440
Jeremy Greenwood, as of
Greenwood and Jovanavic,

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:43.170
which was a key feature of
one of the first two models

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.490
we talked about in lecture 2.

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:51.480
And he's going to focus
on Levine's comment.

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.170
It's kind of cool the way
these things come together.

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:57.870
Levine worried that the
finance causes growth.

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:00.200
Empirical literature
doesn't have

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:06.510
a microfounded view of what
really impedes intermediation.

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.650
So that's what this
paper is about.

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:16.589
And it's going to be sort of
a costly state verification

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:22.140
point of view with diminishing
returns and exogenous,

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:23.250
technological progress.

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:28.320
There's a telling sentence.

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.090
In the paper, Uganda
could more than

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:32.040
double its output if
it would adopt best

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:36.150
practice in the financial
sector, which is something

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.610
like the US or Luxembourg.

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:40.740
Although, there are other
things in the model,

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.950
so that that's not
enough to get it up to,

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:47.190
quote unquote, "its
total potential output."

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:49.170
Again, you see this
language of gaps

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:52.170
here that we focused
on earlier in one

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:55.920
of those financial
possibilities frontier.

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:58.380
So this is very
much trying to get

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:03.970
at gaps in terms of
the underlying model.

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:06.345
AUDIENCE: What are
these other factors?

00:05:06.345 --> 00:05:06.970
PROFESSOR: Hmm?

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:08.595
AUDIENCE: What are
these other factors?

00:05:08.595 --> 00:05:11.280
PROFESSOR: There's going to
be some technological progress

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.430
that varies across countries,
which is pretty standard stuff.

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:19.140
And then this is
kind of layered in,

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:21.450
or it's actually more of
the heart of the model,

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:23.496
given that other.

00:05:23.496 --> 00:05:27.270
Well, we've seen that was done
in the China paper as well.

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:34.530
So another interesting
thing, 29% of US growth

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:38.610
is due to improvements in
financial intermediation.

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:42.090
So this paper both has
transition paths in it,

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:43.770
as well as steady states.

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:46.750
This is a comment
about steady state.

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:50.830
There's exogenous technological
progress going on,

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:53.490
not at the level of
the sort of TFP shocks

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:55.530
that are in front of
the production function,

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:59.400
but in terms of the
monitoring technologies which

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:04.410
intermediaries can use to
verify some private information.

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:07.060
And that's where the
technological progress

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:11.970
is that's driving, say, steady
state US growth rate according

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:17.001
to their calibrated
version of the model.

00:06:17.001 --> 00:06:20.550
Now, there are two key variables
here that they focus a lot

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:24.075
on-- the interest rate spread
and the capital output ratio.

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:30.950
So let's look at them.

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:37.385
These slides are
interest rate spreads.

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:41.600
This is the US.

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:44.000
That's Taiwan.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.450
This is the spread
in the US, maybe 3%,

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:50.300
maybe declining,
but not so clear--

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:52.010
modestly so.

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:57.150
And this is sort of the
capital to GDP ratio.

00:06:57.150 --> 00:07:01.340
And it's paired to Taiwan,
where it's a bit more--

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:02.870
at first at least--

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:04.640
easier to interpret.

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:09.110
This spread is
high and declining.

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:11.350
So this is the transition part.

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:15.710
This is Taiwan experiencing
technological progress that's

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:21.820
lowering, or even I guess
it was in the steady state,

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:24.280
at different levels of
technological progress

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:25.570
in monitoring output.

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:32.660
And as that happens, as the
intermediation system becomes

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:38.420
more efficient,
capital is increasing.

00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:41.770
You can make better
use of capital

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:45.080
because banks have
better information,

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:46.880
and they can lend
more appropriately

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:51.050
and adjust for risk
more appropriately.

00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:53.780
Now, even then, this
diagram is kind of striking.

00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:59.930
Because you can see that this
is steadily rising as the spread

00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:00.700
is coming down.

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:07.740
But relative to US, the capital
to GDP ratio is quite high.

00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:09.195
So you know, just be mindful.

00:08:11.810 --> 00:08:16.400
There's two variables here,
and one of them is GDP.

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:21.080
So low levels of GDP kind
of make that ratio high,

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:25.130
and that's going on and
also moving these variables

00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:27.669
as you compare over
time and over countries.

00:08:32.669 --> 00:08:40.080
So the idea is that
firms, banks, really

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:42.120
monitor cash flows.

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:45.330
The efficiency depends on
the amount of resources

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:48.870
you devote to monitoring
and to the productivity

00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:52.710
of that monitoring technology.

00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:56.460
And as well, firms have
differences ex ante

00:08:56.460 --> 00:09:00.180
in the structure of
returns that they face.

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:06.840
So they get the
usual sort of why

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:11.100
money doesn't flow from
low productive firms

00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:12.270
to high productive firms.

00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:14.430
And the answer is
this monitoring.

00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:17.190
At any moment in
time, there are firms

00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:18.690
with high expected returns.

00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:20.520
They tend to be underfunded.

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:22.920
But it's underfunded
relative to this world

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:27.290
with complete information.

00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:29.930
Whereas, we're in the
constrained second best world.

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:34.850
Others have low returns
and they're overfunded.

00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:40.550
So these are the sort of not
so talented wealthier firms.

00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:43.040
That theme keeps coming
up in all the lectures.

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:45.110
In China, it was the
state-owned sector.

00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:48.920
And last time it was
firms drawing talent,

00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:50.870
and some people having
low talent which

00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:57.560
is persisting and so on, which
is sort of what's true here.

00:09:57.560 --> 00:09:59.760
And of course, as
efficiency increases,

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:03.090
funds are reallocated
from less productive

00:10:03.090 --> 00:10:05.640
to more productive firms,
and the interest rate spread

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:07.070
goes down.

00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:09.510
There's going to be perfect
competition in the banking

00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:10.870
sector.

00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:12.540
So the cost of
borrowing is going

00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:21.780
to fall because these firms
are going to be kind of less

00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:25.560
able to walk away with the
money in terms of the monitoring

00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:26.950
technology.

00:10:26.950 --> 00:10:32.670
So here is a picture of
the interest rate spread.

00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:38.190
And it kind of goes the
way you would think.

00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:40.590
The low interest
rate spread countries

00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:45.300
are these highly
industrialized countries,

00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:50.130
and they tend to have low
capital to GDP ratios,

00:10:50.130 --> 00:10:55.230
in part, because
they have high GDP.

00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:59.160
And here's a
cross-section of countries

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:03.510
that vary with respect to the
level of income and the capital

00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:04.155
output ratio.

00:11:08.290 --> 00:11:12.410
And this is, again,
very similar,

00:11:12.410 --> 00:11:16.280
except this is TFP over here.

00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:22.195
So you can see that interest
rate spread is a bad thing,

00:11:22.195 --> 00:11:24.790
and the higher the spread,
the worse the system.

00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:29.290
So as the interest rate spread
goes down, TFP is going up.

00:11:29.290 --> 00:11:33.130
So TFP is a function of this
sort of financial efficiency.

00:11:33.130 --> 00:11:33.930
Yeah, Matt.

00:11:33.930 --> 00:11:36.845
AUDIENCE: What data do they use
for the interest rate spreads?

00:11:36.845 --> 00:11:37.470
PROFESSOR: Oh--

00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:39.760
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] the
interest rate [INAUDIBLE]..

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:42.880
PROFESSOR: I don't know if they
grabbed some IMF statistics.

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:46.120
I think IMF financial statistics
[INAUDIBLE] have that.

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:49.390
I'm not sure if
that's what they used.

00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:52.450
But basically, yeah,
it's some measure

00:11:52.450 --> 00:11:54.980
of the difference between the
lending rate and the borrowing

00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:55.480
rate.

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:57.790
And then that sounds
good at first,

00:11:57.790 --> 00:12:00.850
until you start thinking about
all the many ways you could

00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:04.030
get at the borrowing rate.

00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:08.650
Often, these things ignore
the informal sector entirely,

00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:10.430
for example.

00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:16.850
This is-- which this paper is
doing as well in the theory.

00:12:16.850 --> 00:12:19.370
And this is the usual
growth accounting stuff.

00:12:19.370 --> 00:12:19.870
OK?

00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:23.290
I don't know that we should have
had this on the earlier slide.

00:12:23.290 --> 00:12:28.990
You want to predict a
country's per capita income.

00:12:28.990 --> 00:12:32.650
It's efficient countries
with higher TFP.

00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:36.040
So this is sort of behind
the Lucas thing, which

00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:38.950
is why isn't money
flowing very quickly

00:12:38.950 --> 00:12:41.470
from low-income countries
to high-income countries,

00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:45.130
since high TFP tends to
mean high marginal product

00:12:45.130 --> 00:12:47.470
of capital and so on.

00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:48.270
But it's amazing.

00:12:48.270 --> 00:12:49.915
They almost all lie on the line.

00:12:52.515 --> 00:12:54.873
AUDIENCE: Is there
a TFP solo residual?

00:12:54.873 --> 00:12:55.540
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:57.850
It's just a solo residual.

00:12:57.850 --> 00:13:01.480
And that's a good comment,
because this paper

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:07.420
is about the different ways
to decompose at the firm level

00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:10.300
the sort of coefficient
that's hanging

00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:13.000
outside the front of
the production function.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:21.580
And then add it up the way
[INAUDIBLE] were doing.

00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:27.700
So they also do this sort of
Rajan/Zingales thing, which

00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:31.720
is to try to calibrate
against the US economy,

00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:33.760
they look at the firm
size distributions

00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:38.530
and the interest rate
spreads in the US

00:13:38.530 --> 00:13:43.000
to get some of their
parameters, and then take it

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.070
to these cross-country data.

00:13:51.388 --> 00:13:53.151
AUDIENCE: Sir.

00:13:53.151 --> 00:13:53.818
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:13:53.818 --> 00:13:55.762
AUDIENCE: Actually,
are [INAUDIBLE]

00:13:55.762 --> 00:13:56.734
distributions similar?

00:13:56.734 --> 00:13:59.180
Or is it developed
[INAUDIBLE] country?

00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:00.520
PROFESSOR: No.

00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:03.670
So what they're saying is the
US would be a more or less

00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:06.350
efficient financial system.

00:14:06.350 --> 00:14:11.440
So you could sort of
think about grabbing

00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:15.160
the relative technology
parameters from that,

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:19.540
and then take those
sort of what are

00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:21.250
counterfactual--
those parameters are

00:14:21.250 --> 00:14:23.800
put in the context of
a developed country

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:27.760
with lots of other restrictions.

00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:30.370
So the idea is to get
the technology right,

00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:33.700
and then somehow figure out what
difference the financial system

00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:35.090
makes.

00:14:35.090 --> 00:14:35.590
Yeah?

00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:37.270
AUDIENCE: What are
the main assumptions

00:14:37.270 --> 00:14:39.166
you have to make
in your own model

00:14:39.166 --> 00:14:41.626
to get that [INAUDIBLE]
distribution [INAUDIBLE]..

00:14:41.626 --> 00:14:43.557
Because I mean,
[INAUDIBLE] then it

00:14:43.557 --> 00:14:45.390
seems to be about the
distribution of talent

00:14:45.390 --> 00:14:46.880
or distribution of [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:47.547
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:14:47.547 --> 00:14:52.540
Each one of these models tries
to be really careful about how

00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:56.440
to map the data into the
notation and assumptions

00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:57.070
they're making.

00:15:01.210 --> 00:15:05.470
And that's-- here, I can
give you a hint of that,

00:15:05.470 --> 00:15:09.820
although I can't get to it in
as much detail as I would like.

00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:17.830
So here's this
production function.

00:15:17.830 --> 00:15:23.320
There is some aggregate shock
that hits all the firms.

00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:27.700
There is some theta, which
is an idiosyncratic-specific

00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:28.870
firm-level shock.

00:15:28.870 --> 00:15:31.060
And then we have the usual--

00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:34.060
Cobb-Douglas actually just
noting constant returns

00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:34.900
to scale.

00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:38.690
Different papers differ on that.

00:15:38.690 --> 00:15:45.340
And where do these
idiosyncratic shocks come from?

00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:49.840
They're drawn at random from--

00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:52.300
in this case, some simple
two-point distribution.

00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:55.720
It could be high or low.

00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:59.050
But here is over and
above that, another source

00:15:59.050 --> 00:16:02.320
of the heterogeneity
that different firms

00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:05.090
have different sets of thetas.

00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:07.300
So the whole sort
of range domain

00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:11.620
can be different, depending
on, quote, "the tau type"

00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:14.140
that these firms are.

00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:17.200
Intermediaries are competitive.

00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:21.010
So they're going to sort of not
get any surplus out of this.

00:16:21.010 --> 00:16:23.920
They raise funds from consumers
and lend them to firms.

00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:26.740
That's typical
intermediation structure.

00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:29.740
And the intermediary
knows the firm's type tau.

00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:36.250
However, it doesn't know output.

00:16:36.250 --> 00:16:39.610
It doesn't know the
idiosyncratic shock theta.

00:16:39.610 --> 00:16:43.550
And it doesn't know
the labor supply.

00:16:43.550 --> 00:16:47.290
So all he's doing here
is being careful to throw

00:16:47.290 --> 00:16:51.280
in enough sources of unknown
that you can't basically

00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:54.100
back out from the output
the unknown things

00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:56.830
on the right-hand side.

00:16:56.830 --> 00:17:00.460
And he probably could have gone
with different assumptions,

00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:03.220
but that's certainly
the spirit of it.

00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:07.074
Or at least, doesn't observe
these things costlessly.

00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:14.260
But there is this
monitoring technology.

00:17:20.030 --> 00:17:26.030
The firms experience their true
productivity, say, high or low,

00:17:26.030 --> 00:17:30.710
call it for the theta
i for a given firm.

00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:35.050
And suppose the firm lies
about it and says theta j.

00:17:35.050 --> 00:17:36.560
Theta's not observed
nor inferred

00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:40.340
from any of the other
ex ante or ex post.

00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:45.680
Then the intermediary devotes
labor to monitoring the claim.

00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:51.770
So this technology
of verification

00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:53.210
is actually resource using.

00:17:53.210 --> 00:17:54.720
It's another
production function.

00:17:58.540 --> 00:18:03.070
And then the size of
the loan is determined.

00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:04.810
That's the capitalization
of the firm.

00:18:04.810 --> 00:18:06.970
They don't have any
wealth on their own.

00:18:06.970 --> 00:18:10.180
That's kind of the
scale of the project.

00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:15.550
The level of productivity
and monitoring is z.

00:18:15.550 --> 00:18:18.880
So that's kind of like whether
it's a completely noisy signal,

00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:24.250
or an extremely accurate signal
of the actual true state theta

00:18:24.250 --> 00:18:25.870
i.

00:18:25.870 --> 00:18:29.710
So this object, Pij is--

00:18:29.710 --> 00:18:33.130
that's the probability
that if the firm

00:18:33.130 --> 00:18:35.950
made a counterfactual
report of theta j

00:18:35.950 --> 00:18:39.700
and really were a theta i,
with this amount of labor

00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:43.480
devoted to monitoring,
given this loan size,

00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:46.480
and given this index of the
productivity of the technology,

00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:49.000
this is the probability
of finding out

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:54.640
what the truth of it really is.

00:18:54.640 --> 00:19:00.230
And so-- and then
this mapping here

00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:03.770
is to provide
between productivity

00:19:03.770 --> 00:19:10.300
and financial sector z,
which, say, we don't see.

00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:16.160
And the things that
we do see, at least

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:19.470
we, as econometricians, see
output and interest rate

00:19:19.470 --> 00:19:19.970
spreads.

00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:24.090
Now, let me pause for a
second because you might well

00:19:24.090 --> 00:19:26.160
think of the obvious
thing is, wait a minute.

00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:28.410
Didn't you just say
output was unobserved?

00:19:28.410 --> 00:19:31.290
Well, this model and
others make a distinction

00:19:31.290 --> 00:19:34.080
between the exposed
data that we have

00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:37.320
as analysts about
firm output, as

00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:41.860
opposed to what the intermediary
is seeing along the way.

00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:44.247
So we're imagining
we do see output

00:19:44.247 --> 00:19:45.580
and these interest rate spreads.

00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:48.490
Those were the slides
I just showed you.

00:19:48.490 --> 00:19:51.370
And then this is
where I'm going to--

00:19:51.370 --> 00:19:53.260
Matt-- going to be a bit vague.

00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:57.700
If you looked at the
equations in the notation,

00:19:57.700 --> 00:20:04.950
they can basically invert
those equations to get x and z.

00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:07.510
And you can do it at a point
in time for a given country,

00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:10.240
or you can do it at two
different points in time.

00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:12.220
If you're getting
z, you're getting

00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:16.000
a measure of this productivity
of the monitoring technology.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.650
And that's why,
for example, they

00:20:17.650 --> 00:20:22.410
are able to make statements
about Taiwan's productivity

00:20:22.410 --> 00:20:26.260
increased over whatever
it was, 10, 15 years,

00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:30.010
along with the drop in the
intermediation spreads.

00:20:30.010 --> 00:20:34.750
They infer that from the drop
in the intermediation spreads

00:20:34.750 --> 00:20:38.108
and the capital output ratio.

00:20:38.108 --> 00:20:38.900
AUDIENCE: Question.

00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:40.058
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:20:40.058 --> 00:20:44.998
AUDIENCE: So the assumption
that the probability of getting

00:20:44.998 --> 00:20:48.460
[INAUDIBLE] is decreasing.

00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:49.250
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:20:49.250 --> 00:20:52.940
So this is a scale effect.

00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:54.980
This came up in Alp's
lecture the other day

00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:59.510
as well, which is if you have
a fixed cost of monitoring

00:20:59.510 --> 00:21:02.780
or something, and then the
country gets richer and richer,

00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:04.850
and credit is going
up and up, then

00:21:04.850 --> 00:21:07.280
basically, the cost
of verification

00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:08.970
is going down and down.

00:21:08.970 --> 00:21:13.580
But here, a country's
getting richer and richer,

00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:16.970
and you don't want this sort
of information imperfection

00:21:16.970 --> 00:21:20.030
to go away other than
through investment

00:21:20.030 --> 00:21:21.320
in improved technology.

00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:25.460
So it allows that--

00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:28.880
I guess that conceptually,
it's like bunch of little firms

00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:29.690
all spread out.

00:21:29.690 --> 00:21:32.090
And the bigger the loan
size, the more plants

00:21:32.090 --> 00:21:36.052
you got to go to see-
something like that.

00:21:36.052 --> 00:21:39.850
AUDIENCE: And is
the result partially

00:21:39.850 --> 00:21:41.380
depending on this assumption?

00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:44.133
Because it might be
the direction is--

00:21:44.133 --> 00:21:44.800
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:45.300
Yeah.

00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:47.110
It matters quite a bit.

00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:48.415
Now, this is kind of linear.

00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:53.970
If it's diminishing, the
effect eventually goes away.

00:21:53.970 --> 00:21:57.345
If it's convex, then I
don't know what happens.

00:21:57.345 --> 00:21:57.970
But it matters.

00:22:03.510 --> 00:22:04.010
All right.

00:22:04.010 --> 00:22:06.320
So that's the spirit
of that paper.

00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:10.330
Again, hopefully, it
whets your appetite and--

00:22:10.330 --> 00:22:13.100
or at least you can get
some sense of what people

00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:16.915
are doing in the literature.

00:22:16.915 --> 00:22:18.290
And there's one
other that I want

00:22:18.290 --> 00:22:22.340
to talk about before we get to
the main paper of this lecture.

00:22:22.340 --> 00:22:25.910
And this I discovered
recently, actually--

00:22:25.910 --> 00:22:29.270
"International Capital
Flows and Credit Markets--

00:22:29.270 --> 00:22:31.520
A Tale of Two Frictions."

00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:37.000
Somehow everyone's got
taken with Dickens.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:40.397
The one we looked at last time
was "A Tale of Two Sectors."

00:22:40.397 --> 00:22:42.730
I don't know whether you
thought that was clever or not.

00:22:42.730 --> 00:22:44.950
This paper was
written after that.

00:22:49.010 --> 00:22:53.590
So it's kind of
intriguing, and I'm not

00:22:53.590 --> 00:22:55.270
quite sure I totally believe it.

00:22:55.270 --> 00:23:00.710
But let me try to
walk you through it.

00:23:00.710 --> 00:23:04.570
So the idea is we
see a lot of capital

00:23:04.570 --> 00:23:07.675
moving around the world,
and we see boom/bust cycles.

00:23:10.053 --> 00:23:12.220
And they're going to try
to get both of those things

00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:14.140
in into one model.

00:23:14.140 --> 00:23:16.780
So it's ambitious.

00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:19.390
Global imbalances, large
and persistent capital

00:23:19.390 --> 00:23:21.940
flows coming out
of Asia to the US--

00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:25.840
we talked about that
last time in the--

00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:27.370
last time in the China paper.

00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:35.130
And there the idea is it's
hard to make good use of it

00:23:35.130 --> 00:23:39.690
within China for the reasons
that that model and others

00:23:39.690 --> 00:23:41.860
postulate, namely,
financial friction.

00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:43.920
So then it should
go somewhere else.

00:23:51.750 --> 00:23:58.190
But you could also think about
it on the other side of it.

00:23:58.190 --> 00:23:59.780
This is the tricky part.

00:23:59.780 --> 00:24:13.000
Namely, that that money is
going to unproductive investment

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:14.320
in the US.

00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:18.680
So at least that's
ex post the judgment.

00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:20.590
So then you have to
model sort of what's

00:24:20.590 --> 00:24:24.490
going on with the US interest
rate that would allow

00:24:24.490 --> 00:24:28.390
the existence of bad
projects and the coexistence

00:24:28.390 --> 00:24:29.965
of bad projects
with good projects.

00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:40.380
So they try to do both.

00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:51.930
So again, there's
credit market which

00:24:51.930 --> 00:24:54.480
intermediates the money
that comes from savers

00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:56.760
and goes to investors.

00:24:56.760 --> 00:25:00.560
Individuals are endowed
with some resources

00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:03.780
and with an investment project.

00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:06.240
And they have to decide
whether to do the project

00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:09.255
and become an
entrepreneur, in which case

00:25:09.255 --> 00:25:11.130
they're going to want
some credit to fund it,

00:25:11.130 --> 00:25:14.940
or to forego their project and
become savers, in which case

00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:17.340
they supply resources
to the credit market.

00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:20.610
Now, this building block is the
same on almost all the papers

00:25:20.610 --> 00:25:22.880
that we've looked at.

00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:26.120
It's an occupation
choice model of--

00:25:29.410 --> 00:25:34.120
that's used to address
financial issues.

00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:36.760
To give adverse
selection a crucial role,

00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:38.170
we assume individual
productivity

00:25:38.170 --> 00:25:42.610
is private information and
unobservable by the lenders.

00:25:42.610 --> 00:25:47.810
That kind of sounds like the
previous Greenwood paper.

00:25:47.810 --> 00:25:49.840
So there is some
cross-subsidization

00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:55.670
between high and low
productivity entrepreneurs.

00:25:55.670 --> 00:25:59.290
A key assumption-- there's
only one interest rate.

00:25:59.290 --> 00:26:01.360
So there's no menu of contracts.

00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:04.825
There's no other ways to
separate good from bad.

00:26:07.750 --> 00:26:11.610
And the thing, to
say it intuitively,

00:26:11.610 --> 00:26:15.840
about adverse selection
is, who wants to borrow

00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:18.120
at a given interest rate?

00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:20.430
Well, that's really
attractive for people who

00:26:20.430 --> 00:26:24.040
expect never to repay loans.

00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:26.410
So the lender is going to
have to somehow break even

00:26:26.410 --> 00:26:29.590
on those bad types that
are indistinguishable

00:26:29.590 --> 00:26:30.490
from the good types.

00:26:30.490 --> 00:26:34.600
And that is a force
determining the interest rate.

00:26:38.540 --> 00:26:44.800
Now, the question is whether
that kind of perverse dynamics

00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:49.210
would move around
with wealth and so on.

00:26:49.210 --> 00:26:50.006
Yes.

00:26:50.006 --> 00:26:52.440
AUDIENCE: Are the lenders
endowed with mechanisms

00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:53.691
to prevent that?

00:26:53.691 --> 00:26:55.780
Is there physical
collateral, or is there

00:26:55.780 --> 00:26:56.822
some sort of reputation--

00:26:56.822 --> 00:26:57.920
PROFESSOR: Not here.

00:26:57.920 --> 00:26:58.420
Not here.

00:26:58.420 --> 00:27:01.738
But there is a big
literature that argues--

00:27:01.738 --> 00:27:02.280
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:03.812
So in this-- this
environment has

00:27:03.812 --> 00:27:06.270
the potential for the sort of
adverse selection [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:06.270 --> 00:27:08.213
type things.

00:27:08.213 --> 00:27:08.880
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:12.790
There is always an issue in
papers and as researchers

00:27:12.790 --> 00:27:16.540
at what-- how much-- how
many substantive things you

00:27:16.540 --> 00:27:18.760
want going on at the same time.

00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:22.240
I would say this is among
the simpler adverse selection

00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:22.740
thing.

00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:26.770
Personally, I would always
think menus of contracts

00:27:26.770 --> 00:27:28.720
could select--

00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:31.930
allow selection or
sort of truth-telling.

00:27:31.930 --> 00:27:35.080
And that's just shut down.

00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:37.420
But Rothschild/Stiglitz
shut that down.

00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:43.960
So maybe that's off to
a tradition of sorts.

00:27:48.070 --> 00:27:51.640
So what are the implications
of this adverse selection?

00:27:54.110 --> 00:27:55.860
The interest rate has
to be higher than it

00:27:55.860 --> 00:27:58.890
would have been otherwise.

00:27:58.890 --> 00:28:00.390
But on the other
hand, there's a lot

00:28:00.390 --> 00:28:01.680
of borrowing and investment.

00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:04.980
Now, be careful here, because
these low productivity

00:28:04.980 --> 00:28:07.750
guys are happy to be borrowers.

00:28:07.750 --> 00:28:09.420
So not all borrowing
is a good thing.

00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:12.750
And that's kind of the seeds
of the bust getting created.

00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:18.350
Because of adverse
selection we have

00:28:18.350 --> 00:28:21.410
this wedge between the
equilibrium interest rate

00:28:21.410 --> 00:28:24.740
and the marginal
return to investment.

00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:26.630
Again, it's a common wedge.

00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:28.880
We just did an
interest rate spread.

00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:31.610
Here's another way to
think about that spread.

00:28:31.610 --> 00:28:33.740
That doesn't mean
it doesn't matter.

00:28:33.740 --> 00:28:37.770
The underlying
assumptions do matter.

00:28:37.770 --> 00:28:42.540
But this phenomenon is pervasive
across countries in the data,

00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:45.280
and is a big part of
almost all these models.

00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:50.510
So adverse selection
means that the economy

00:28:50.510 --> 00:28:53.770
can attract more
capital, and boost in

00:28:53.770 --> 00:28:58.230
that capital flows seems
odd just to say it there.

00:28:58.230 --> 00:28:59.310
You can see it written.

00:29:02.370 --> 00:29:07.410
But again, the idea is that
somehow the interest rate

00:29:07.410 --> 00:29:09.840
is higher than it would have
been in the full information

00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:15.822
economy, and outside investors
seek the higher interest.

00:29:15.822 --> 00:29:17.530
So that's kind of what
they mean by that.

00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:27.310
But the true marginal return
lies below the interest rate.

00:29:27.310 --> 00:29:29.710
So something bad is happening.

00:29:29.710 --> 00:29:34.570
And the way it comes out in
the bath here is the capital--

00:29:34.570 --> 00:29:39.900
there's lower aggregate
consumption because you've

00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:42.857
used resources inefficiently.

00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:48.720
And then they claim this
adverse selection actually

00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:50.400
is a force for volatility.

00:29:54.810 --> 00:29:56.295
This is kind of key.

00:29:56.295 --> 00:29:58.950
The incentives of less
productive individuals

00:29:58.950 --> 00:30:02.490
to become entrepreneurs
are strongest--

00:30:02.490 --> 00:30:06.000
there's bad types borrow and
don't expect to repay much.

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:09.180
That force is strongest,
ironically, when the capital

00:30:09.180 --> 00:30:12.360
stock is low and income is low.

00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:19.930
And what's that all about?

00:30:19.930 --> 00:30:28.730
Well, basically this
debt overhang problem

00:30:28.730 --> 00:30:31.130
is more severe when the
capital stock is low,

00:30:31.130 --> 00:30:35.560
because you have to borrow more
than you would if the capital

00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:37.990
stock were high, and you
could almost self-finance.

00:30:41.260 --> 00:30:45.040
And there's a lot of
untalented firms borrowing

00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:49.180
when the total income and
capital stock of the economy

00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:49.800
is low.

00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:56.480
Or conversely, as capital
and income increases,

00:30:56.480 --> 00:31:00.120
that cross-subsidization
is decreasing.

00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:05.560
There's more self-financing,
and entrepreneurship

00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:10.400
loses its appeal for less
productive individuals.

00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:12.400
Well, I mean, it's actually
kind of interesting.

00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:15.790
Because you can see the
dynamics of occupation choice

00:31:15.790 --> 00:31:18.260
that we've had in
the other papers.

00:31:18.260 --> 00:31:20.830
Who's going to be a firm
as opposed to a wage earner

00:31:20.830 --> 00:31:24.760
depends on what happens
if you were a firm

00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:25.735
and decided to borrow.

00:31:29.670 --> 00:31:31.770
And then they actually
get a boom/bust cycle.

00:31:34.280 --> 00:31:41.520
They claim to show that capital
inflows are going to fuel

00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:43.080
this accumulation period.

00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:47.280
And then you'll
get a contraction.

00:31:51.900 --> 00:31:55.410
Actually, toward the end, the
tale of two obstacles or two

00:31:55.410 --> 00:32:05.450
frictions, is they throw
pledgeability on top of it.

00:32:05.450 --> 00:32:09.580
So the more traditional sort
of collateral constraint

00:32:09.580 --> 00:32:12.370
reduces investment and
lowers the interest rate.

00:32:12.370 --> 00:32:13.390
We've seen that, right?

00:32:13.390 --> 00:32:18.720
You can't borrow as much,
so there's less pressure

00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:19.660
on the interest rate.

00:32:19.660 --> 00:32:23.310
So the interest
rate would be lower.

00:32:23.310 --> 00:32:27.030
Ironically, that low
interest rate, though,

00:32:27.030 --> 00:32:30.300
decreases the
returns to savings.

00:32:30.300 --> 00:32:35.550
And why be a wage earner and get
a lower return on your savings

00:32:35.550 --> 00:32:38.400
when you can be a not
so good entrepreneur

00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:40.040
and borrow money
at low interest?

00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:45.310
So you get this
sort of, they claim,

00:32:45.310 --> 00:32:48.720
a kind of accelerator
or exacerbating feature,

00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:51.990
that the adverse
selection is interacting

00:32:51.990 --> 00:32:54.331
with the limited
collateral constraint.

00:32:58.660 --> 00:33:05.060
And that should whet your
appetite for that paper.

00:33:05.060 --> 00:33:10.220
Now again, I apologize in a way,
although it wasn't my intention

00:33:10.220 --> 00:33:16.220
to go through all the
details of that paper.

00:33:16.220 --> 00:33:20.180
And it is on the
Stellar website.

00:33:20.180 --> 00:33:24.350
And we can study
it in more detail.

00:33:24.350 --> 00:33:25.970
But I offered it
here just to show

00:33:25.970 --> 00:33:28.370
you the kinds of
phenomenon that people

00:33:28.370 --> 00:33:32.030
are trying to address
with the interplay

00:33:32.030 --> 00:33:33.880
of financial frictions.

00:33:36.810 --> 00:33:46.690
And then we come to the
paper I wish to focus on,

00:33:46.690 --> 00:33:48.930
which is, again, a
tale of two frictions.

00:33:48.930 --> 00:33:50.370
But we can't use that title.

00:33:54.850 --> 00:33:59.090
But we're doing it
in a different way.

00:33:59.090 --> 00:34:04.330
We allow moral hazard and
also limited commitment.

00:34:04.330 --> 00:34:06.460
So on the one hand,
we're going to take

00:34:06.460 --> 00:34:10.360
the traditional limited
commitment constraint

00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:13.719
and remove it, and
insert a moral hazard

00:34:13.719 --> 00:34:15.290
constraint explicitly.

00:34:15.290 --> 00:34:17.469
And this time, I can
show you the equations.

00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:23.850
But we also allow--

00:34:23.850 --> 00:34:28.830
we don't get rid of the
capital constraint entirely.

00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:35.159
And then you say, well,
what are the rules here

00:34:35.159 --> 00:34:36.480
for making this stuff up?

00:34:39.110 --> 00:34:41.270
And my answer is the data.

00:34:43.989 --> 00:34:48.780
And in particular-- this is
the reverse order coming here--

00:34:48.780 --> 00:34:51.179
you will see a paper
that I've written

00:34:51.179 --> 00:34:55.770
with Alex Karaivanov, where
we have consumption, output,

00:34:55.770 --> 00:34:59.780
investment, and
capital stock data,

00:34:59.780 --> 00:35:08.340
and we actually estimate a
variety of financial regimes.

00:35:08.340 --> 00:35:11.100
And it turns out that the
so-called limited commitment

00:35:11.100 --> 00:35:16.890
regime fits the data best in
the rural data that I have

00:35:16.890 --> 00:35:21.180
and in the Northeast, and
the moral hazard regime

00:35:21.180 --> 00:35:25.633
fits better in the urban
areas and in the areas

00:35:25.633 --> 00:35:26.550
in and around Bangkok.

00:35:29.470 --> 00:35:32.230
So that's the way to think
about these two frictions.

00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:35.050
They're, for us, going
to be microfounded.

00:35:35.050 --> 00:35:37.450
Although here, we're just
borrowing that and putting it

00:35:37.450 --> 00:35:37.950
in.

00:35:41.035 --> 00:35:41.535
So--

00:35:46.248 --> 00:35:47.240
AUDIENCE: Sir.

00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:48.065
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:35:48.065 --> 00:35:49.440
AUDIENCE: So
basically, are you--

00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:52.880
you're going to sort of let
these two things interplay,

00:35:52.880 --> 00:36:00.770
and you're going to
have them be differently

00:36:00.770 --> 00:36:03.180
important in different places.

00:36:03.180 --> 00:36:03.990
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:36:03.990 --> 00:36:06.790
So that's where we end up.

00:36:06.790 --> 00:36:09.570
And where we start is
we have an economy,

00:36:09.570 --> 00:36:12.060
and I'll tell you all
about the environment.

00:36:12.060 --> 00:36:14.910
And then I'll describe what goes
on with the limited commitment

00:36:14.910 --> 00:36:19.200
constraint as if it
were the whole economy.

00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:22.590
I'll do the same for moral
hazard, the whole economy.

00:36:22.590 --> 00:36:28.130
Then I'll have like 50-50, and
use the general equilibrium.

00:36:28.130 --> 00:36:32.810
And the punch line is going
to be the general equilibrium

00:36:32.810 --> 00:36:34.370
with the two
frictions is not just

00:36:34.370 --> 00:36:39.110
a simple convex combination
of the two extremes.

00:36:39.110 --> 00:36:40.820
And the reason that
that's going on

00:36:40.820 --> 00:36:43.930
has to do with the
general equilibrium.

00:36:43.930 --> 00:36:44.930
So you're going to get--

00:36:47.953 --> 00:36:50.370
roughly, you're going to get
interest rates and wages that

00:36:50.370 --> 00:36:53.520
are somewhat between
the two extremes.

00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:56.040
But then given
that, the question

00:36:56.040 --> 00:36:59.880
about who is to be a firm or a
worker depends on the obstacles

00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:01.860
that you face.

00:37:01.860 --> 00:37:03.780
And actually, what
turns out to be

00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:07.710
cool at the parameters we have,
which we think are reasonable

00:37:07.710 --> 00:37:16.260
and are largely similar
to what Alex and I had,

00:37:16.260 --> 00:37:20.520
that in the places
with moral hazard,

00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:23.310
output is substantially higher.

00:37:27.990 --> 00:37:30.140
There are slightly
more firms there.

00:37:30.140 --> 00:37:33.120
They're larger.

00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:38.040
Those firms are renting more
capital or borrowing more.

00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:44.240
The ratio of credit to GDP,
the financing ratio, is higher.

00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:47.460
And they employ more labor.

00:37:47.460 --> 00:37:52.580
Without any geography
somehow, we've created these--

00:37:52.580 --> 00:37:55.250
replicated these stylized
facts of development

00:37:55.250 --> 00:37:59.150
when you think about rural
areas versus urban areas.

00:37:59.150 --> 00:38:03.080
Money is flowing from
savings in rural areas

00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:07.325
to the urbanizing cities.

00:38:07.325 --> 00:38:11.500
Now, I'm not going to claim that
we've captured everything going

00:38:11.500 --> 00:38:12.700
on in all these countries.

00:38:12.700 --> 00:38:17.230
But this simple
sort of combination

00:38:17.230 --> 00:38:20.470
of financial
frictions allows that.

00:38:20.470 --> 00:38:23.150
In that sense, this is very
different from the other paper.

00:38:23.150 --> 00:38:24.005
Yes.

00:38:24.005 --> 00:38:27.310
AUDIENCE: And so do you have
something that endogenously

00:38:27.310 --> 00:38:32.570
makes these two regimes being
relevant in those areas?

00:38:32.570 --> 00:38:36.790
PROFESSOR: That's a good
question, and it's--

00:38:36.790 --> 00:38:40.240
at this point, it's
hard to answer.

00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:43.960
I mean, it looks
as if either there

00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:46.990
is a legal restriction
on collateral,

00:38:46.990 --> 00:38:50.940
or the set of financial
institutions that are operating

00:38:50.940 --> 00:38:54.600
in the rural areas is
different from what's

00:38:54.600 --> 00:38:58.260
going on in the urban areas.

00:38:58.260 --> 00:39:01.590
And if we were going to
follow Jeremy's path,

00:39:01.590 --> 00:39:03.590
we would ask your question.

00:39:03.590 --> 00:39:07.260
We are asking, and we just
don't have answers yet,

00:39:07.260 --> 00:39:11.370
as to what is the configuration
of the financial service

00:39:11.370 --> 00:39:12.480
providers?

00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:14.760
You'll see there is a
heavy distinction-- we've

00:39:14.760 --> 00:39:17.820
already seen, actually, where
the commercial banks are

00:39:17.820 --> 00:39:20.850
operating and where this
government agricultural bank is

00:39:20.850 --> 00:39:21.420
operating.

00:39:21.420 --> 00:39:24.840
And I think that's
probably part of the story.

00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:30.540
But in this paper, we do
not take a stand on it.

00:39:30.540 --> 00:39:33.690
We take as given just
this sort of difference

00:39:33.690 --> 00:39:36.970
in the financial
information regime.

00:39:36.970 --> 00:39:38.580
OK.

00:39:38.580 --> 00:39:48.130
So this, we've already said.

00:39:48.130 --> 00:39:51.720
This, we've already
talked about.

00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:54.360
So we get to the model.

00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:59.980
So a household that could
decide to be either a wage

00:39:59.980 --> 00:40:05.370
earner or a firm will maximize
discounted expected utility.

00:40:05.370 --> 00:40:08.100
Beta is the discount rate.
u is the common utility

00:40:08.100 --> 00:40:10.830
function, the
arguments of which are

00:40:10.830 --> 00:40:17.420
consumption of this household i,
and effort of this household i.

00:40:17.420 --> 00:40:22.110
We'll parameterize this when
we need to compute something.

00:40:22.110 --> 00:40:24.720
At this level,
it's quite general.

00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:28.440
You can-- if x is equal--
this is like a binary choice.

00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:30.900
You can be a worker or a firm.

00:40:30.900 --> 00:40:33.460
By convention, when x
is 1, you're a firm,

00:40:33.460 --> 00:40:36.430
and when x is zero,
you're a worker.

00:40:36.430 --> 00:40:39.200
And that's going
to be endogenous.

00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:45.950
If you do become a firm, you
have this productivity draw z,

00:40:45.950 --> 00:40:48.710
and it evolves over
time according to sort

00:40:48.710 --> 00:40:51.590
of a standard Markov process.

00:40:51.590 --> 00:40:54.110
I was rushing toward the end
of the lecture last time,

00:40:54.110 --> 00:40:59.960
but this was the thing
that was in the [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:59.960 --> 00:41:03.023
paper toward the
end, and I guess

00:41:03.023 --> 00:41:04.190
in some of the other papers.

00:41:04.190 --> 00:41:06.350
And finally, we have wealth.

00:41:06.350 --> 00:41:09.180
So at the beginning
of the period,

00:41:09.180 --> 00:41:13.680
everyone has some
predetermined level of wealth,

00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:16.290
and it's in the
bank essentially.

00:41:16.290 --> 00:41:19.710
And so an individual
is characterized

00:41:19.710 --> 00:41:23.160
by their initial wealth
and their current talent.

00:41:26.490 --> 00:41:29.410
Here is the production function.

00:41:29.410 --> 00:41:33.520
It's diminishing returns
to scale in capital

00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:34.540
and hired labor.

00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:41.330
And then we have these sort
of things out front here.

00:41:41.330 --> 00:41:44.700
The notation varies from
one paper to the next.

00:41:44.700 --> 00:41:49.610
But epsilon is here,
an idiosyncratic shock.

00:41:49.610 --> 00:41:55.960
iid over households, and z
is that level of productivity

00:41:55.960 --> 00:41:59.830
we already talked about
that's evolving over time.

00:41:59.830 --> 00:42:05.730
Now, there's
actually-- the effort

00:42:05.730 --> 00:42:09.030
of the entrepreneur is
another factor of production.

00:42:09.030 --> 00:42:13.440
And that's basically little e.

00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:18.180
So the way that the effort of
the entrepreneur is modeled

00:42:18.180 --> 00:42:20.380
is through this.

00:42:20.380 --> 00:42:25.080
The epsilon, the
idiosyncratic productivity,

00:42:25.080 --> 00:42:29.160
depends on how hard the
entrepreneur is, quote,

00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:31.710
"working," or
thinking, you know,

00:42:31.710 --> 00:42:35.020
staying up at night worrying--
basically, due diligence.

00:42:35.020 --> 00:42:36.900
This is not measured.

00:42:36.900 --> 00:42:40.140
You do see the epsilon,
but you don't see the e.

00:42:40.140 --> 00:42:44.670
And that's if-- well, at least
in the moral hazard model,

00:42:44.670 --> 00:42:45.720
you don't see the e.

00:42:53.340 --> 00:42:56.510
But I should qualify
that we're going

00:42:56.510 --> 00:42:58.100
through the standard
environment,

00:42:58.100 --> 00:43:00.890
and there's going to
be a full information

00:43:00.890 --> 00:43:03.200
environment with limited
commitment in which everything

00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:06.460
is seen and full
insurance is possible,

00:43:06.460 --> 00:43:08.510
versus the moral hazard
environment which

00:43:08.510 --> 00:43:12.500
is going to be the source
of limited insurance,

00:43:12.500 --> 00:43:14.750
and it's going to interact--

00:43:14.750 --> 00:43:19.460
both frictions interact
with productivity.

00:43:19.460 --> 00:43:26.270
So there are banks or
financial intermediaries,

00:43:26.270 --> 00:43:32.180
and you should think of them
as basically risk syndicates.

00:43:32.180 --> 00:43:38.210
Because not only do they sort
of lend out of the wealth

00:43:38.210 --> 00:43:41.310
that households have been
depositing with them,

00:43:41.310 --> 00:43:46.250
they can also smooth over
idiosyncratic shocks.

00:43:46.250 --> 00:43:49.730
So there's a state
contingent payment

00:43:49.730 --> 00:43:51.850
that the banks can make--

00:43:51.850 --> 00:43:54.200
it could be negative--

00:43:54.200 --> 00:43:56.600
say, to the households
as a function

00:43:56.600 --> 00:44:00.575
of their realized
and observed epsilon.

00:44:03.980 --> 00:44:08.440
Now, in some
respects, it's still--

00:44:11.430 --> 00:44:15.420
we're not solving a
massive programming problem

00:44:15.420 --> 00:44:17.760
and then capturing
the interest rates

00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:21.690
and wages off some
first order conditions.

00:44:21.690 --> 00:44:24.150
Instead, we're going to
imagine that these risk

00:44:24.150 --> 00:44:28.740
syndicates, these banks, and
the firms and the households

00:44:28.740 --> 00:44:33.840
all take as given economy-wide
interest rates and wages.

00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:35.280
And like many of
the other papers,

00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:39.210
we're going to have to determine
those by supply and demand

00:44:39.210 --> 00:44:40.680
mechanically.

00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:45.630
So that's a
computational burden,

00:44:45.630 --> 00:44:49.690
but it is one that other
papers have faced as well.

00:44:49.690 --> 00:44:52.290
Now, what to do about talent--

00:44:52.290 --> 00:44:53.880
is it insurable or not?

00:44:53.880 --> 00:44:57.120
Well, we kind of decided
to try to be realistic

00:44:57.120 --> 00:44:58.770
and to not let it be insured.

00:45:02.080 --> 00:45:03.170
We could go the other way.

00:45:03.170 --> 00:45:06.640
In some sense, we know
exactly how to do it.

00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:09.610
And there's some duals
which would be satisfied

00:45:09.610 --> 00:45:11.470
if we had allowed it.

00:45:11.470 --> 00:45:14.530
But we thought it was just
on the side of realism

00:45:14.530 --> 00:45:20.510
to say don't worry
about your job market.

00:45:23.990 --> 00:45:25.640
We're going to cover that.

00:45:25.640 --> 00:45:28.820
NYT is going to
fully insure you.

00:45:28.820 --> 00:45:31.650
Well, of course, we could put
moral hazard on the z thing.

00:45:31.650 --> 00:45:34.785
But anyway, we
didn't get into that.

00:45:39.510 --> 00:45:44.082
So you're going assign the
occupation, induce effort--

00:45:44.082 --> 00:45:44.790
where did I say--

00:45:44.790 --> 00:45:47.190
I guess I didn't say it.

00:45:47.190 --> 00:45:49.110
It'll come up in a
second, hopefully.

00:45:53.540 --> 00:45:54.040
Yeah.

00:45:54.040 --> 00:45:54.860
It was right here.

00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:01.890
We actually also
allow there to be

00:46:01.890 --> 00:46:07.060
some insurance and moral hazard
issues on the worker side.

00:46:07.060 --> 00:46:12.430
Now, for simplicity, we give
them this same p of e function.

00:46:12.430 --> 00:46:14.960
We could have allowed
it to be different.

00:46:14.960 --> 00:46:16.100
What is this?

00:46:16.100 --> 00:46:20.020
Well, the idea is you can
sort of put a lot of effort

00:46:20.020 --> 00:46:22.930
into working, and
the firm is going

00:46:22.930 --> 00:46:26.300
to observe your total
sort of productivity.

00:46:26.300 --> 00:46:30.850
But the firm doesn't
see your effort.

00:46:30.850 --> 00:46:33.720
It's like piece
rate in some sense.

00:46:33.720 --> 00:46:37.320
So we just got tired
of being asymmetric,

00:46:37.320 --> 00:46:41.130
as so many papers are about--
you know, there's an insurance

00:46:41.130 --> 00:46:43.800
problem for intermediaries
and wage earners don't

00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:46.410
suffer from things like that.

00:46:50.770 --> 00:46:52.840
So here's the timeline.

00:46:52.840 --> 00:46:55.740
The household comes in with--

00:46:55.740 --> 00:46:58.680
a certain household i comes
in with a certain amount

00:46:58.680 --> 00:47:01.980
of wealth and talent.

00:47:01.980 --> 00:47:06.550
There's going to be an
assignment, if you will,

00:47:06.550 --> 00:47:09.150
of who's a worker or a firm.

00:47:09.150 --> 00:47:11.490
Then if a firm--

00:47:11.490 --> 00:47:15.400
well, if a worker or firm ever
gets determined, if a firm--

00:47:15.400 --> 00:47:18.300
the capitalization and
labor hiring of the firm

00:47:18.300 --> 00:47:23.560
gets determined, then
the epsilon hits.

00:47:23.560 --> 00:47:24.670
Effort comes first.

00:47:24.670 --> 00:47:32.210
Epsilon comes after that and
gets in the way, so to speak,

00:47:32.210 --> 00:47:34.970
especially if effort
is not observed.

00:47:34.970 --> 00:47:40.430
So this is like idiosyncratic
risk subject to moral hazard

00:47:40.430 --> 00:47:41.510
potentially.

00:47:41.510 --> 00:47:45.770
Then consumption and the
level of your savings

00:47:45.770 --> 00:47:47.720
that you're carrying
over putting

00:47:47.720 --> 00:47:50.150
into the bank for
tomorrow, those things

00:47:50.150 --> 00:47:52.910
are functions potentially
of those epsilons.

00:47:52.910 --> 00:47:56.870
So the point is, you do
bear the consequences

00:47:56.870 --> 00:48:00.200
in the moral hazard
model of shirking.

00:48:00.200 --> 00:48:04.640
If you shirked and
your productivity

00:48:04.640 --> 00:48:06.470
were low as a
consequence of that,

00:48:06.470 --> 00:48:09.560
you're going to have
to take a hit in terms

00:48:09.560 --> 00:48:14.060
of lower consumption and lower
savings from tomorrow on.

00:48:23.110 --> 00:48:30.600
So here's the optimization
problem really of the bank,

00:48:30.600 --> 00:48:33.360
but it's more like an
equilibrium outcome.

00:48:33.360 --> 00:48:38.430
The banks are
basically competitive.

00:48:38.430 --> 00:48:40.290
There's free entry.

00:48:40.290 --> 00:48:44.770
And for any sort of cohort
fully observed, by the way,

00:48:44.770 --> 00:48:48.450
az sort of people out there--

00:48:48.450 --> 00:48:52.830
there's a lot of them in
every little cubbyhole--

00:48:52.830 --> 00:48:55.170
the banks compete to
offer them contracts.

00:48:55.170 --> 00:48:59.890
In effect, they
would bid down things

00:48:59.890 --> 00:49:03.380
until utility is maximized.

00:49:03.380 --> 00:49:07.660
So it's as if they're maximizing
the utility of this cohort

00:49:07.660 --> 00:49:10.180
by choice of all these
things I just went through.

00:49:14.020 --> 00:49:17.770
And this is the
resource constraint

00:49:17.770 --> 00:49:21.650
that the risk syndicate faces.

00:49:21.650 --> 00:49:23.600
Partly it's familiar
and partly not.

00:49:23.600 --> 00:49:27.800
Namely, you've got
uses and sources.

00:49:27.800 --> 00:49:33.170
The uses of money or resources
is in consumption and how much

00:49:33.170 --> 00:49:35.860
you save for next time.

00:49:35.860 --> 00:49:40.740
And the sources
comes from if you're

00:49:40.740 --> 00:49:45.680
a firm in this syndicate,
your net profits,

00:49:45.680 --> 00:49:48.660
after subtracting off the
cost of labor and capital

00:49:48.660 --> 00:49:53.690
and depreciating the capital,
and from the other guys

00:49:53.690 --> 00:49:54.920
who are wage earners.

00:49:58.700 --> 00:50:00.920
And as is standard
in many models,

00:50:00.920 --> 00:50:07.970
you begin the period with
basically the savings

00:50:07.970 --> 00:50:10.250
that you had as a bank.

00:50:10.250 --> 00:50:13.260
But now they've sort
of accrued interest.

00:50:13.260 --> 00:50:14.730
So you have principal
and interest

00:50:14.730 --> 00:50:16.022
at the beginning of the period.

00:50:16.022 --> 00:50:20.040
Now, it looks like a standard
sort of incomplete markets

00:50:20.040 --> 00:50:23.700
model, where you have the
choices between saving

00:50:23.700 --> 00:50:26.670
and, quote, "borrowing/lending."

00:50:26.670 --> 00:50:30.550
The difference here and-- well,
and some profit maximization

00:50:30.550 --> 00:50:31.050
embedded.

00:50:31.050 --> 00:50:36.220
But the difference really
is the summing over epsilon.

00:50:36.220 --> 00:50:42.860
So this is the total sort
of assigned consumption

00:50:42.860 --> 00:50:45.890
and savings throughout
the whole syndicate,

00:50:45.890 --> 00:50:48.140
the average per capita number.

00:50:48.140 --> 00:50:51.670
And this is the
per capita sources.

00:50:51.670 --> 00:50:55.250
The intermediaries in trying
to break even on every epsilon

00:50:55.250 --> 00:50:57.170
type in the population--

00:50:57.170 --> 00:51:00.590
that's the risk-sharing
part of it,

00:51:00.590 --> 00:51:02.570
that some people could
have higher output

00:51:02.570 --> 00:51:04.410
than other people.

00:51:04.410 --> 00:51:08.100
but subject to
incentives or insurance.

00:51:08.100 --> 00:51:11.660
The intermediary will smooth
that by assigning, say,

00:51:11.660 --> 00:51:14.840
higher consumption than output
for the low epsilon guys,

00:51:14.840 --> 00:51:18.360
and conversely for
the high epsilon guys.

00:51:18.360 --> 00:51:18.860
Yes.

00:51:18.860 --> 00:51:21.170
AUDIENCE: So the financial
intermediary, they

00:51:21.170 --> 00:51:24.620
can control the distribution
between consumption and asset?

00:51:24.620 --> 00:51:25.850
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:51:25.850 --> 00:51:26.840
That's all observed.

00:51:26.840 --> 00:51:29.480
AUDIENCE: So household
can't bypass that

00:51:29.480 --> 00:51:32.493
by saving themselves.

00:51:32.493 --> 00:51:33.410
PROFESSOR: They don't.

00:51:33.410 --> 00:51:33.910
Yeah.

00:51:33.910 --> 00:51:36.320
We assume not.

00:51:36.320 --> 00:51:45.830
But you could
assume that they get

00:51:45.830 --> 00:51:48.170
their sort of
assignment of assets,

00:51:48.170 --> 00:51:49.510
and then they act on their own.

00:51:49.510 --> 00:51:50.885
But they would
put it in the bank

00:51:50.885 --> 00:51:52.170
because they accrue interest.

00:51:52.170 --> 00:51:55.570
So there's really no loss in
letting it sit in the bank.

00:51:55.570 --> 00:52:00.093
Now, we can have banks
competing with one another.

00:52:00.093 --> 00:52:01.135
That's a bit more subtle.

00:52:01.135 --> 00:52:01.660
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] the
other way around though, right?

00:52:01.660 --> 00:52:03.100
PROFESSOR: Hmm?

00:52:03.100 --> 00:52:06.110
AUDIENCE: You
can't like really--

00:52:06.110 --> 00:52:06.610
OK.

00:52:06.610 --> 00:52:08.235
Like, the household
can choose to save,

00:52:08.235 --> 00:52:12.828
but household can
choose to consume too?

00:52:12.828 --> 00:52:13.370
I don't know.

00:52:13.370 --> 00:52:17.450
I feel that here, bank has
more control over household,

00:52:17.450 --> 00:52:19.360
and they can say exactly
how much you can--

00:52:19.360 --> 00:52:21.640
PROFESSOR: Well, that's
probably a better way

00:52:21.640 --> 00:52:22.720
to think about it anyway.

00:52:22.720 --> 00:52:28.060
Because as you'll see,
these information frictions

00:52:28.060 --> 00:52:29.710
and collateral
restrictions create

00:52:29.710 --> 00:52:33.947
pressures that make savings more
or less than what households

00:52:33.947 --> 00:52:36.280
might want to do if they were
just following their Euler

00:52:36.280 --> 00:52:36.790
equation.

00:52:36.790 --> 00:52:39.460
So in the end, I agree with you.

00:52:39.460 --> 00:52:41.200
What's going to be
actually interesting

00:52:41.200 --> 00:52:42.670
is that it's going--

00:52:42.670 --> 00:52:43.920
and you'll see this--

00:52:43.920 --> 00:52:45.310
it's going to go
a different way.

00:52:45.310 --> 00:52:49.060
In the collateral
constraint model,

00:52:49.060 --> 00:52:53.050
you would like to
borrow more, actually,

00:52:53.050 --> 00:52:55.340
in order to have more
assets in the future.

00:52:55.340 --> 00:52:57.190
That's not allowed to happen.

00:52:57.190 --> 00:52:59.890
So they're going to be
borrowing-constrained

00:52:59.890 --> 00:53:03.500
in terms of looking at their
intertemporal consumption path.

00:53:03.500 --> 00:53:08.467
The guy subject to this sort
of incentive moral hazard

00:53:08.467 --> 00:53:10.300
constraint, they're
actually going to end up

00:53:10.300 --> 00:53:11.740
being savings-constrained.

00:53:11.740 --> 00:53:13.520
They would like to save more.

00:53:13.520 --> 00:53:18.760
So it's already a hint that
the dynamics of the household

00:53:18.760 --> 00:53:21.160
decision problems
are very different,

00:53:21.160 --> 00:53:23.710
not just of the firm,
but the households.

00:53:27.380 --> 00:53:31.550
So what do we mean by
the incentive constraint?

00:53:31.550 --> 00:53:35.570
Well, when effort
is unobserved, you

00:53:35.570 --> 00:53:37.850
want to induce the
assigned effort.

00:53:37.850 --> 00:53:40.010
So these are the good boys.

00:53:40.010 --> 00:53:45.200
They were recommended to do
e, and they actually do it.

00:53:45.200 --> 00:53:48.920
So this is the distribution
of output, epsilon,

00:53:48.920 --> 00:53:50.640
that results from it.

00:53:50.640 --> 00:53:54.200
And they go into tomorrow
with the assigned levels

00:53:54.200 --> 00:53:57.590
of savings and draw talent.

00:53:57.590 --> 00:54:00.050
But effort is not seen.

00:54:00.050 --> 00:54:03.680
So they actually
contemplate some

00:54:03.680 --> 00:54:05.660
out of equilibrium
behavior, like doing

00:54:05.660 --> 00:54:10.140
e hat, which is other than e.

00:54:10.140 --> 00:54:12.430
Now, what are the
consequences of that?

00:54:12.430 --> 00:54:14.430
Well, first of all, there's
a direct consequence

00:54:14.430 --> 00:54:16.830
in the utility function,
because shirking

00:54:16.830 --> 00:54:21.780
might be good in terms
of higher utility.

00:54:21.780 --> 00:54:24.090
But also, there is
a direct consequence

00:54:24.090 --> 00:54:27.220
in terms of the
distribution of output.

00:54:27.220 --> 00:54:30.720
So this is sort of the
moral hazard induced

00:54:30.720 --> 00:54:33.870
productivity consequence.

00:54:33.870 --> 00:54:38.340
And if you do some typical
monotonicity or something,

00:54:38.340 --> 00:54:41.580
then higher effort is
associated with likely

00:54:41.580 --> 00:54:44.490
getting higher epsilons.

00:54:44.490 --> 00:54:50.910
So that's a standard-looking
incentive constraint.

00:54:50.910 --> 00:54:52.770
The-- yes.

00:54:52.770 --> 00:54:55.540
AUDIENCE: So probably
we could introduce

00:54:55.540 --> 00:54:58.530
some costs associated
with changing jobs

00:54:58.530 --> 00:55:01.682
between [INAUDIBLE].

00:55:01.682 --> 00:55:04.399
Does it change the
analysis at all?

00:55:08.172 --> 00:55:09.630
PROFESSOR: Well,
you get to choose.

00:55:09.630 --> 00:55:10.210
But yeah.

00:55:10.210 --> 00:55:11.400
There's no extra cost.

00:55:14.040 --> 00:55:16.900
It would increase the
dimensionality of the state

00:55:16.900 --> 00:55:19.980
space rather enormously,
because then you'd not only

00:55:19.980 --> 00:55:23.940
have to worry about the
current distribution of wealth

00:55:23.940 --> 00:55:26.370
and talent, you'd have to worry
about what these guys were

00:55:26.370 --> 00:55:28.200
doing last period.

00:55:28.200 --> 00:55:31.620
And it's actually hard enough
to get any kind of solutions,

00:55:31.620 --> 00:55:33.790
analytic or numeric.

00:55:33.790 --> 00:55:37.860
So I think that's the constraint
here is keeping the state.

00:55:37.860 --> 00:55:41.070
I mean, there is-- you'll
see that there's already

00:55:41.070 --> 00:55:42.960
a huge distribution
of wealth, and we're

00:55:42.960 --> 00:55:46.410
going to have to keep track of
how that histogram is evolving

00:55:46.410 --> 00:55:52.250
the population jointly with
the talent distribution.

00:55:52.250 --> 00:55:56.960
So hopefully, good
enough for starters.

00:55:56.960 --> 00:55:57.460
Oh.

00:55:57.460 --> 00:56:00.090
I'm going to skip this slide.

00:56:00.090 --> 00:56:02.590
I'll tell you what was on it,
and then we'll come back to it

00:56:02.590 --> 00:56:04.060
when we get to the microdata.

00:56:07.950 --> 00:56:10.980
Basically, instead
of solving directly

00:56:10.980 --> 00:56:15.600
for consumption as a function of
epsilon and all of that stuff,

00:56:15.600 --> 00:56:20.950
we trick it into a linear
programming problem.

00:56:20.950 --> 00:56:25.680
And we do that by keeping
track of histograms of things,

00:56:25.680 --> 00:56:29.220
basically, the joint
distribution of consumption,

00:56:29.220 --> 00:56:36.770
epsilon, recommended effort and
so on, respecting the timing.

00:56:36.770 --> 00:56:39.860
So in words, hopefully,
you would think

00:56:39.860 --> 00:56:41.650
that's kind of equivalent.

00:56:41.650 --> 00:56:43.320
Anyway.

00:56:43.320 --> 00:56:45.290
Now, what's the gain?

00:56:45.290 --> 00:56:48.710
The gain is it literally
is a linear program.

00:56:48.710 --> 00:56:52.520
So that little module can be
solved as a linear programming

00:56:52.520 --> 00:56:54.350
problem, and that's
how we're computing

00:56:54.350 --> 00:56:59.020
the solutions to that part.

00:56:59.020 --> 00:57:03.060
But this isn't the right
context to go into the notation.

00:57:03.060 --> 00:57:08.350
We'll do it in a very simple
convex cost or a fixed cost

00:57:08.350 --> 00:57:10.510
problem first, and then
build up to it later.

00:57:13.350 --> 00:57:16.600
So I'm missing something.

00:57:16.600 --> 00:57:17.100
Oh, yeah.

00:57:17.100 --> 00:57:17.640
This thing.

00:57:20.340 --> 00:57:23.100
So this is the other constraint,
that the capitalization

00:57:23.100 --> 00:57:26.200
of the firm is just some
proportion of your wealth.

00:57:26.200 --> 00:57:29.620
Lambda could be greater than
1, but it's not infinity.

00:57:29.620 --> 00:57:31.710
So this is the
constraint that we had

00:57:31.710 --> 00:57:34.940
on so many of the other papers.

00:57:34.940 --> 00:57:36.540
And you can tell
stories and model

00:57:36.540 --> 00:57:39.190
this about running away
with a capital and so on.

00:57:39.190 --> 00:57:41.010
But this is the essence of it.

00:57:44.010 --> 00:57:45.110
We could do both.

00:57:45.110 --> 00:57:47.810
We're going to imagine
that it's one or the other.

00:57:47.810 --> 00:57:52.260
I mean, both simultaneously
for a given firm.

00:57:52.260 --> 00:57:56.040
But we're going to put people
in one sector or the other.

00:57:56.040 --> 00:57:59.790
So then we're going to solve for
the factors occupation choice,

00:57:59.790 --> 00:58:02.385
labor, hiring, capitalization.

00:58:02.385 --> 00:58:05.610
And you want to think
about labor supply--

00:58:05.610 --> 00:58:07.560
it's just only slightly tricky.

00:58:07.560 --> 00:58:09.470
X means entrepreneur.

00:58:09.470 --> 00:58:11.880
1 minus x means wage earner.

00:58:11.880 --> 00:58:15.780
What's the total labor supply
coming from wage earners?

00:58:15.780 --> 00:58:18.750
Well, epsilon is
units of labor supply.

00:58:18.750 --> 00:58:20.190
It's induced by the effort.

00:58:23.230 --> 00:58:25.300
There's a histogram.

00:58:25.300 --> 00:58:29.760
So we basically add up
overall the epsilons

00:58:29.760 --> 00:58:34.490
at the fractions with which
they exist in the population.

00:58:34.490 --> 00:58:36.940
And this is total labor supply.

00:58:36.940 --> 00:58:47.920
And so then the rest
is pretty less daunting

00:58:47.920 --> 00:58:49.810
in terms of notation.

00:58:49.810 --> 00:58:54.820
We have-- we're going to equate
labor supply to labor demand.

00:58:54.820 --> 00:58:58.780
This is the l being
employed within the firms.

00:58:58.780 --> 00:59:01.960
The firms vary in
terms of their a and z.

00:59:01.960 --> 00:59:05.380
And everyone's facing
these economy-wide wage

00:59:05.380 --> 00:59:07.960
and interest rates.

00:59:07.960 --> 00:59:10.720
But this does depend
on the az argument,

00:59:10.720 --> 00:59:12.910
so we have to add up over--

00:59:12.910 --> 00:59:16.370
or integrate up over-- all the
az people in the population.

00:59:16.370 --> 00:59:18.580
So again, in
practice, we're going

00:59:18.580 --> 00:59:22.180
to have a large finite
number of wealths,

00:59:22.180 --> 00:59:24.120
a finite number of
talents, and this is going

00:59:24.120 --> 00:59:28.070
to be some kind of summation.

00:59:28.070 --> 00:59:30.710
This is also the capital
clearing constraint.

00:59:30.710 --> 00:59:32.930
All that wealth sitting
there-- forget the d.

00:59:32.930 --> 00:59:35.720
Don't know why that's there.

00:59:35.720 --> 00:59:38.360
You have all that wealth
sitting in the bank,

00:59:38.360 --> 00:59:45.420
and it's going to be lent out
at interest to the firms that

00:59:45.420 --> 00:59:46.560
are renting the capital.

00:59:49.930 --> 00:59:57.370
So we grab some parameters
and some functional forms.

00:59:57.370 --> 01:00:00.232
These are pretty traditional.

01:00:00.232 --> 01:00:02.440
I guess we didn't want to
do anything unconventional,

01:00:02.440 --> 01:00:05.860
because we want to show what
difference the obstacles make

01:00:05.860 --> 01:00:08.650
rather than force you
into a utility function

01:00:08.650 --> 01:00:10.390
you don't believe.

01:00:10.390 --> 01:00:15.550
Also, we can grab from the
literature values for these

01:00:15.550 --> 01:00:16.900
that people believe.

01:00:16.900 --> 01:00:24.130
I don't mean to belittling
calibration all the time.

01:00:24.130 --> 01:00:25.550
Beta is realistic here.

01:00:25.550 --> 01:00:31.760
It's about basically 5%, or
95% of the future is valued.

01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:33.560
Sigma's the degree
of risk aversion.

01:00:33.560 --> 01:00:34.700
It's 1.5.

01:00:34.700 --> 01:00:39.080
People have values well
within that range--

01:00:39.080 --> 01:00:44.440
just utility is a bit tricky
to parameterize of effort,

01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:46.960
but the power function
is the Frisch elasticity.

01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:48.760
People have estimated that.

01:00:48.760 --> 01:00:54.940
This is a simple transition
which we made up.

01:00:54.940 --> 01:00:58.750
But in other papers, people talk
about entry and exit of firms,

01:00:58.750 --> 01:01:03.380
and we could imagine doing that.

01:01:03.380 --> 01:01:05.300
And they are also
similar to the parameters

01:01:05.300 --> 01:01:08.490
that Alex and I estimate would
likely [INAUDIBLE] functions.

01:01:08.490 --> 01:01:09.620
So here is the--

01:01:09.620 --> 01:01:15.070
with the Euler equation,
it's at the household side.

01:01:15.070 --> 01:01:18.862
Borrowing-constrained households
have a Lagrange multiplier

01:01:18.862 --> 01:01:20.445
on that limited
commitment constraint.

01:01:20.445 --> 01:01:27.660
It turns out to be tomorrow,
but in expectation, it

01:01:27.660 --> 01:01:31.260
leads to this same phenomenon
that the marginal utility

01:01:31.260 --> 01:01:35.580
of consumption is high today and
lower in expectation tomorrow.

01:01:35.580 --> 01:01:38.940
So these guys are
borrowing-constrained.

01:01:38.940 --> 01:01:39.670
Yes.

01:01:39.670 --> 01:01:42.400
AUDIENCE: Question, sir--
going back to [INAUDIBLE]..

01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:44.825
So when you
described it earlier,

01:01:44.825 --> 01:01:48.670
so something that entrepreneur
can do to [INAUDIBLE]

01:01:48.670 --> 01:01:50.230
to make productivity high.

01:01:50.230 --> 01:01:52.960
If it was mainly
labor monitoring,

01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:55.765
I guess it would maybe sort of
really only scale with labor.

01:01:55.765 --> 01:01:57.390
Would that-- how much
would that change

01:01:57.390 --> 01:01:59.080
what goes on in the model.

01:01:59.080 --> 01:02:01.360
PROFESSOR: Oh, that's a
bit like in the spirit

01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:03.990
of Jeremy's model, and
we're not doing that.

01:02:03.990 --> 01:02:06.370
But yes, you could put--

01:02:06.370 --> 01:02:08.320
it's very much like
what Jeremy is doing.

01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:10.900
You could put the technology
for monitoring effort

01:02:10.900 --> 01:02:13.420
to create a signal
at least of effort,

01:02:13.420 --> 01:02:15.340
and that would mitigate--
that would move us

01:02:15.340 --> 01:02:17.155
more toward the full
insurance solution.

01:02:21.870 --> 01:02:28.780
And this is the weird one.

01:02:28.780 --> 01:02:32.370
And I'm not sure if you've
seen this yet or not

01:02:32.370 --> 01:02:34.110
in public finance.

01:02:34.110 --> 01:02:38.400
But-- so I'm just going
to basically assert

01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:41.460
that the first order
condition, when

01:02:41.460 --> 01:02:44.370
you're subject to moral
hazard, looks like this.

01:02:44.370 --> 01:02:46.740
And for obvious reasons,
this is sometimes

01:02:46.740 --> 01:02:51.380
called the inverse
Euler equation,

01:02:51.380 --> 01:02:53.045
because this is 1 over u prime.

01:02:56.210 --> 01:02:59.150
The point here is
Jensen's inequality.

01:02:59.150 --> 01:03:02.700
You know, if you replace--

01:03:02.700 --> 01:03:06.260
if you pull the expectation
operator outside of it,

01:03:06.260 --> 01:03:08.540
you'd have 1 over u
prime, but the inverse

01:03:08.540 --> 01:03:10.880
would take it back to u prime.

01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:14.540
But when you move that
expectation operator outside,

01:03:14.540 --> 01:03:18.706
you're taking an average
over the interior object.

01:03:18.706 --> 01:03:19.550
I'm sorry.

01:03:19.550 --> 01:03:22.100
This is an average over the
interior object as opposed

01:03:22.100 --> 01:03:25.160
to an integration
from the outside.

01:03:25.160 --> 01:03:29.940
So it is basically a classical
example of Jensen's inequality,

01:03:29.940 --> 01:03:33.790
and it makes the
right-hand side higher.

01:03:33.790 --> 01:03:36.777
That's mechanical,
but hopefully--

01:03:36.777 --> 01:03:38.110
we've already talked about this.

01:03:38.110 --> 01:03:44.720
You can see that in
the limited commitment,

01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:48.910
people cannot borrow
as much as they want.

01:03:48.910 --> 01:03:52.690
That's going to make the
demand for funds less,

01:03:52.690 --> 01:03:54.970
and the interest
rate is going to be

01:03:54.970 --> 01:03:58.390
less when all the economy
is subject from that limited

01:03:58.390 --> 01:04:00.010
commitment
constraint, as opposed

01:04:00.010 --> 01:04:04.060
to the moral hazard economy
where households and firms are

01:04:04.060 --> 01:04:05.800
savings-constrained.

01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:07.240
So they would like to save more.

01:04:07.240 --> 01:04:08.390
Savings is less.

01:04:08.390 --> 01:04:09.130
It's scarce.

01:04:09.130 --> 01:04:10.630
You have a higher interest rate.

01:04:10.630 --> 01:04:13.670
So these interest rate
numbers kind of make sense.

01:04:13.670 --> 01:04:16.950
Don't be too spooked by
the negative interest rate.

01:04:16.950 --> 01:04:20.620
You know, we have a depreciation
rate in this economy.

01:04:20.620 --> 01:04:23.230
So it's still sort of on net--

01:04:23.230 --> 01:04:24.250
it's positive.

01:04:27.180 --> 01:04:32.610
And then you can see, comparing
these two different countries,

01:04:32.610 --> 01:04:36.810
GDP, TFP--

01:04:36.810 --> 01:04:39.450
the TFP dynamics
are very different,

01:04:39.450 --> 01:04:42.270
although the numbers,
though different,

01:04:42.270 --> 01:04:44.040
are not radically different.

01:04:46.770 --> 01:04:49.740
TFP is dragged down in the
limited commitment economy,

01:04:49.740 --> 01:04:53.760
because high productivity firms
cannot borrow as much as they

01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:55.030
want.

01:04:55.030 --> 01:04:57.930
They can't exploit their z.

01:04:57.930 --> 01:05:00.690
Whereas, in the
moral hazard economy,

01:05:00.690 --> 01:05:04.065
you have to induce effort,
and that's kind of a drag.

01:05:10.540 --> 01:05:15.520
I mean, if you were draconian
and you had no insurance,

01:05:15.520 --> 01:05:19.400
then yes, people would
be working very hard.

01:05:19.400 --> 01:05:21.140
But that's actually not optimal.

01:05:21.140 --> 01:05:24.990
The right thing to do is to have
this blend between insurance

01:05:24.990 --> 01:05:27.440
and productivity.

01:05:27.440 --> 01:05:30.760
So partially, it's-- this
language people use about moral

01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:33.820
hazard in the banking
system and in the press

01:05:33.820 --> 01:05:36.280
and the policymakers,
pick that up like,

01:05:36.280 --> 01:05:38.140
let's get rid of moral hazard.

01:05:38.140 --> 01:05:40.930
That's not the right
way to think about it.

01:05:40.930 --> 01:05:42.880
Moral hazard is an
information problem.

01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:46.210
You want incentives
to do as best you can,

01:05:46.210 --> 01:05:47.830
given the moral hazard problem.

01:05:47.830 --> 01:05:51.010
But it's like-- eliminate
moral hazard is like, let's

01:05:51.010 --> 01:05:52.450
just shut down
all the insurance,

01:05:52.450 --> 01:05:53.490
then you don't have a problem.

01:05:53.490 --> 01:05:55.115
But yeah, well, you
got other problems.

01:06:00.160 --> 01:06:01.507
Wages are a bit different.

01:06:01.507 --> 01:06:02.965
They're higher in
the moral-- these

01:06:02.965 --> 01:06:05.620
are economy-wide wages and
interest rates, of course.

01:06:10.870 --> 01:06:12.790
But you can also see
a bigger difference

01:06:12.790 --> 01:06:14.725
in the financing ratio.

01:06:17.290 --> 01:06:22.540
Actually, labor here tends
to compensate for the more

01:06:22.540 --> 01:06:26.410
restricted capital, and
the drag makes labor lower

01:06:26.410 --> 01:06:27.820
in the moral hazard economy.

01:06:32.260 --> 01:06:35.800
External finance is more limited
in the limited commitment

01:06:35.800 --> 01:06:36.340
economy.

01:06:36.340 --> 01:06:36.910
Why?

01:06:36.910 --> 01:06:37.990
Because you can't borrow.

01:06:37.990 --> 01:06:40.660
You run into that
lambda constraint.

01:06:40.660 --> 01:06:44.090
There's nothing like that
in the moral hazard economy.

01:06:44.090 --> 01:06:48.314
So the external finance
to GDP ratio is higher.

01:06:48.314 --> 01:06:52.512
AUDIENCE: So why is the
interest rate negative?

01:06:52.512 --> 01:06:54.220
PROFESSOR: That's,
again, because there's

01:06:54.220 --> 01:06:58.150
an interest rate going on here.

01:06:58.150 --> 01:07:00.460
I mean capital gets
utilized, and it gets--

01:07:00.460 --> 01:07:01.390
it's depreciating.

01:07:01.390 --> 01:07:05.030
And you've got to basically
pay for that somehow.

01:07:05.030 --> 01:07:07.120
So it lowers the net yield.

01:07:09.790 --> 01:07:12.990
And here's
interesting-- you know,

01:07:12.990 --> 01:07:16.800
I didn't get to say much at
all about Joaquin Blaum's paper

01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:18.330
on inequality.

01:07:18.330 --> 01:07:21.090
But I get to be reminded
to say something now,

01:07:21.090 --> 01:07:26.130
because here the wealth
inequality curve's generated

01:07:26.130 --> 01:07:29.370
by the different constraints.

01:07:29.370 --> 01:07:33.240
And you can see there's
actually more inequality

01:07:33.240 --> 01:07:35.870
in the limited
commitment economy

01:07:35.870 --> 01:07:38.386
than there is in the
moral hazard economy.

01:07:42.580 --> 01:07:47.053
But again, that has to do with
this dispersion of the capital.

01:07:47.053 --> 01:07:49.510
Capital tends to be more--

01:07:49.510 --> 01:07:52.000
not identical, but
more compressed

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:55.680
in the moral hazard economy.

01:07:55.680 --> 01:07:56.950
And capital is very limited.

01:07:56.950 --> 01:08:04.840
You can't take advantage of your
productivity in the other one.

01:08:04.840 --> 01:08:08.050
So the wealth dispersion
is playing a bigger role,

01:08:08.050 --> 01:08:10.990
and feeding back in turn to--

01:08:10.990 --> 01:08:13.990
it's like you can't
get the convergences.

01:08:17.010 --> 01:08:19.200
And then we take 50-50.

01:08:19.200 --> 01:08:23.484
Same economy-- now we have the
urban/rural of the same size,

01:08:23.484 --> 01:08:23.984
and--

01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:27.760
AUDIENCE: Question.

01:08:27.760 --> 01:08:29.220
PROFESSOR: Yep.

01:08:29.220 --> 01:08:32.250
AUDIENCE: So in the slides
with the parameters,

01:08:32.250 --> 01:08:35.043
you don't talk about lambda.

01:08:35.043 --> 01:08:39.229
How much do you
think that to be?

01:08:39.229 --> 01:08:41.340
The-- so the-- how
much is the constraint?

01:08:41.340 --> 01:08:43.939
PROFESSOR: I'm not sure
I remember the number.

01:08:43.939 --> 01:08:45.180
AUDIENCE: But-- I mean, do you
remember how you configured it?

01:08:45.180 --> 01:08:46.290
PROFESSOR: It should have been
on that list of parameters?

01:08:46.290 --> 01:08:47.500
It wasn't on that page?

01:08:47.500 --> 01:08:48.000
No.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:49.950
I don't remember.

01:08:49.950 --> 01:08:52.830
We probably-- it was
probably something like 1.3,

01:08:52.830 --> 01:08:54.703
because that's--

01:08:54.703 --> 01:08:56.370
but that's right off
the top of my head.

01:08:56.370 --> 01:08:56.939
AUDIENCE: How do you--

01:08:56.939 --> 01:08:58.265
[INAUDIBLE] in the same way?

01:08:58.265 --> 01:08:59.640
Because that's
how-- like, that's

01:08:59.640 --> 01:09:00.960
something you estimated
somewhere else?

01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:01.979
PROFESSOR: Hopefully,
we just drew it

01:09:01.979 --> 01:09:03.810
from this literature,
the [INAUDIBLE] paper

01:09:03.810 --> 01:09:06.750
that you've seen before.

01:09:06.750 --> 01:09:08.399
I don't think we
matched it with data.

01:09:10.920 --> 01:09:13.522
That's actually hard to
pin down in the data.

01:09:13.522 --> 01:09:14.939
AUDIENCE: Would
it be particularly

01:09:14.939 --> 01:09:17.010
sensitive to the
choice of lambda?

01:09:17.010 --> 01:09:18.660
PROFESSOR: Oh, yeah.

01:09:18.660 --> 01:09:19.160
Yeah.

01:09:19.160 --> 01:09:23.020
Remember the [INAUDIBLE]
thing, where lambda goes from--

01:09:23.020 --> 01:09:25.990
I think it was 1.3 to infinity.

01:09:25.990 --> 01:09:28.410
And at infinity, there's
no constraint at all.

01:09:28.410 --> 01:09:30.870
You're back to the full
insurance, full productivity

01:09:30.870 --> 01:09:31.392
solution.

01:09:31.392 --> 01:09:32.934
AUDIENCE: So some
of the things about

01:09:32.934 --> 01:09:36.647
like the wealth
inequality and [INAUDIBLE]

01:09:36.647 --> 01:09:37.689
expect those [INAUDIBLE].

01:09:37.689 --> 01:09:38.800
PROFESSOR: Oh, yeah.

01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:41.590
Now what-- so what
you're not seeing here,

01:09:41.590 --> 01:09:44.380
although we have
recently done this,

01:09:44.380 --> 01:09:49.450
is run a whole suite of
computations for all kinds

01:09:49.450 --> 01:09:53.170
of-- we put sort of error
bands or confidence intervals

01:09:53.170 --> 01:09:59.100
on these just to make sure that
none of the things that we want

01:09:59.100 --> 01:10:01.320
to emphasize are--

01:10:01.320 --> 01:10:03.110
either they're
always true, or we're

01:10:03.110 --> 01:10:04.660
going to say they're
not always true,

01:10:04.660 --> 01:10:06.700
and they depend on
these parameters.

01:10:06.700 --> 01:10:09.060
But you're absolutely
right, that just showing

01:10:09.060 --> 01:10:12.710
some simulations looks a
bit arbitrary, especially

01:10:12.710 --> 01:10:14.460
for things like lambda,
which I'm not even

01:10:14.460 --> 01:10:15.752
remembering in the moment, so--

01:10:18.680 --> 01:10:20.930
But different things would
matter for the moral hazard

01:10:20.930 --> 01:10:21.710
economy too.

01:10:21.710 --> 01:10:25.190
You know, the curvature of
the labor supply utility

01:10:25.190 --> 01:10:26.690
that generates labor supply--

01:10:26.690 --> 01:10:29.630
that's going to be
that Frisch elasticity.

01:10:29.630 --> 01:10:33.500
We'll see that again when we
get to the sort of microdata.

01:10:33.500 --> 01:10:36.660
And the chi that sits in
front of labor disutility--

01:10:36.660 --> 01:10:41.450
that's a huge number,
important number.

01:10:41.450 --> 01:10:44.130
So what are these slides?

01:10:44.130 --> 01:10:45.960
Well, this is a
bit like generating

01:10:45.960 --> 01:10:47.670
many, many, many simulations.

01:10:47.670 --> 01:10:52.290
We have many economies,
and we vary this fraction

01:10:52.290 --> 01:10:53.460
from zero to one.

01:10:53.460 --> 01:10:56.580
I just showed you
the 50-50 economy.

01:10:56.580 --> 01:11:00.510
But this allows everyone to be
in limited commitment, everyone

01:11:00.510 --> 01:11:04.500
to be in moral hazard,
or anywhere in between.

01:11:04.500 --> 01:11:08.100
And so you can see how
GDP, TFP, and so on,

01:11:08.100 --> 01:11:13.380
how these things move
around with the fraction

01:11:13.380 --> 01:11:17.760
of the population that are
subject to moral hazard.

01:11:17.760 --> 01:11:24.450
And partly, this mirrors what
I said before in labor supply.

01:11:24.450 --> 01:11:27.180
But on other things, you can
see things aren't monotone.

01:11:27.180 --> 01:11:29.330
So those are surprises.

01:11:29.330 --> 01:11:32.880
It actually goes up, and
then it comes down again.

01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:35.190
GDP climbs pretty fast,
and then it kind of

01:11:35.190 --> 01:11:37.390
wobbles around a bit.

01:11:37.390 --> 01:11:39.960
We've tried to get rid of
as many wobbles as possible

01:11:39.960 --> 01:11:42.900
for worries that they're
just computational.

01:11:42.900 --> 01:11:45.480
But some of them-- some
of the wobbles remain.

01:11:45.480 --> 01:11:48.970
So I've kind of learned to
not pay too much attention.

01:11:48.970 --> 01:11:52.620
But this is not numerical error.

01:11:52.620 --> 01:11:56.952
This is systematic, this drop.

01:11:56.952 --> 01:11:59.160
And you can see what the
wages and the interest rates

01:11:59.160 --> 01:12:04.390
are doing, and the fraction
of firms for that matter.

01:12:04.390 --> 01:12:11.880
Now, here is back to 1/2, 1/2.

01:12:11.880 --> 01:12:17.370
But within that economy, we have
the limited commitment sector

01:12:17.370 --> 01:12:18.540
and the moral hazard sector.

01:12:22.230 --> 01:12:25.680
Obviously, there is
economy-wide wages

01:12:25.680 --> 01:12:28.170
and interest rates are the same.

01:12:28.170 --> 01:12:30.760
It's one economy clearing.

01:12:30.760 --> 01:12:33.910
But other things vary
across these two columns.

01:12:33.910 --> 01:12:35.740
Probably the most
exciting part is

01:12:35.740 --> 01:12:40.610
this, which is let's look
at labor, for example.

01:12:40.610 --> 01:12:44.030
Labor employed in
the sector 0.38;

01:12:44.030 --> 01:12:47.650
labor supplied by
the sector 0.53.

01:12:47.650 --> 01:12:50.500
So they're exporters
of labor, if you allow

01:12:50.500 --> 01:12:53.270
me to use that terminology.

01:12:53.270 --> 01:12:56.090
Or people are
costlessly migrating

01:12:56.090 --> 01:13:00.260
from the limited commitment
sector to the moral hazard.

01:13:00.260 --> 01:13:03.500
And indeed, you'll pick up
the other side of this thing,

01:13:03.500 --> 01:13:09.560
basically, labor supplied,
0.46; labor demanded, 0.61.

01:13:09.560 --> 01:13:12.230
Now, you say, why isn't
it all zero and one.

01:13:12.230 --> 01:13:13.190
No, no, no, no, no.

01:13:13.190 --> 01:13:14.420
Remember the z's.

01:13:14.420 --> 01:13:15.680
Remember the productivity.

01:13:15.680 --> 01:13:19.400
Every sector has some
really inefficient people

01:13:19.400 --> 01:13:21.380
who shouldn't be running firms.

01:13:21.380 --> 01:13:24.350
They're going to supply
labor no matter what,

01:13:24.350 --> 01:13:28.880
or at least at these
equilibrium wages.

01:13:28.880 --> 01:13:32.210
And the same thing is true
with the flow of funds

01:13:32.210 --> 01:13:35.160
if we had the geographic
decomposition--

01:13:35.160 --> 01:13:37.790
and we got Mexico to
do this, by the way.

01:13:37.790 --> 01:13:41.180
It's really cool--
through their CNBV,

01:13:41.180 --> 01:13:42.530
their financial regulator.

01:13:47.003 --> 01:13:48.670
And the question
there, is money flowing

01:13:48.670 --> 01:13:51.250
to Mexico City from
the outlying areas

01:13:51.250 --> 01:13:53.140
as they improve intermediation?

01:13:53.140 --> 01:13:57.040
And what consequences does that
have for the outlying areas?

01:13:57.040 --> 01:14:01.540
Well, here, money's flowing from
the limited commitments sector

01:14:01.540 --> 01:14:02.840
to the moral hazard sector.

01:14:02.840 --> 01:14:05.650
So this is where the
action is, so to speak.

01:14:05.650 --> 01:14:07.390
We don't get a lot of
difference in terms

01:14:07.390 --> 01:14:09.700
of the numbers of firms,
but you're clearly

01:14:09.700 --> 01:14:12.920
seeing differences in
terms of employment size.

01:14:12.920 --> 01:14:18.030
And remember the China paper
was like this, where labor--

01:14:18.030 --> 01:14:22.320
the allocation of labor
was playing a huge role.

01:14:39.240 --> 01:14:41.720
So-- sorry.

01:14:41.720 --> 01:14:43.805
We had more results
over the weekend.

01:14:48.270 --> 01:14:49.682
We've been trying to get these.

01:14:49.682 --> 01:14:51.390
This, we've had for
a long time, but I'll

01:14:51.390 --> 01:14:54.885
show you something else
that's quite exciting.

01:14:57.580 --> 01:14:59.300
First of all, speed
of transitions--

01:14:59.300 --> 01:15:05.370
you remember that where a paper
was all about the puzzle, which

01:15:05.370 --> 01:15:08.220
is, why don't miracle
Asian economies grow

01:15:08.220 --> 01:15:17.220
even faster if you believe
they were in a solo world?

01:15:17.220 --> 01:15:18.360
But of course, there is--

01:15:18.360 --> 01:15:20.290
and then they assume
this financial friction,

01:15:20.290 --> 01:15:22.850
which slowed things down.

01:15:22.850 --> 01:15:26.450
The friction you assume is
going to make a big difference

01:15:26.450 --> 01:15:28.340
to the speed of transitions.

01:15:28.340 --> 01:15:30.560
Actually, here, even
in the steady state,

01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:34.700
you can ask how fast do
people go from an az state

01:15:34.700 --> 01:15:37.250
to an a prime z prime state?

01:15:37.250 --> 01:15:40.220
This is some big Markov matrix.

01:15:40.220 --> 01:15:42.230
It's sort of steady
state, but it's

01:15:42.230 --> 01:15:45.680
transition from
the household level

01:15:45.680 --> 01:15:48.240
from one state to another.

01:15:48.240 --> 01:15:53.540
So you may remember, you
can multiply those matrices

01:15:53.540 --> 01:15:57.530
over and over times each
other, or you can basically

01:15:57.530 --> 01:16:02.240
do an eigenvalue,
eigenvector decomposition.

01:16:02.240 --> 01:16:07.970
And the closer this eigenvalue
is to 1, the slower things are.

01:16:07.970 --> 01:16:09.080
Things are moving.

01:16:09.080 --> 01:16:11.120
The next multiplication
of the matrix

01:16:11.120 --> 01:16:13.280
is kind of very similar--

01:16:13.280 --> 01:16:16.190
that times the
control [INAUDIBLE]

01:16:16.190 --> 01:16:18.840
very similar to what is
in the previous period.

01:16:18.840 --> 01:16:21.650
It's 0.93.

01:16:21.650 --> 01:16:24.260
That's a very-- sorry.

01:16:24.260 --> 01:16:29.060
0.93 for one; 0.98
for the other.

01:16:29.060 --> 01:16:34.070
So there's roughly three
more times difference

01:16:34.070 --> 01:16:38.090
in the speed of sort of within
steady state transitions going

01:16:38.090 --> 01:16:38.970
on.

01:16:38.970 --> 01:16:43.123
Now, there's a technical
reason for this, basically.

01:16:43.123 --> 01:16:44.540
On the limited
commitment thing we

01:16:44.540 --> 01:16:46.880
have this forward-looking
savings behavior.

01:16:46.880 --> 01:16:48.710
So people are going
to save their way out

01:16:48.710 --> 01:16:50.210
of these constraints.

01:16:50.210 --> 01:16:52.370
And they can do
it pretty quickly.

01:16:52.370 --> 01:16:55.220
In fact, you're going
to see some homework

01:16:55.220 --> 01:17:03.080
and so on motivated by thinking
through [INAUDIBLE] papers

01:17:03.080 --> 01:17:05.270
and job market papers
and so on, that kind of

01:17:05.270 --> 01:17:12.380
get at this thing, which is--
the twist is, why doesn't money

01:17:12.380 --> 01:17:13.610
flow from the US to India?

01:17:13.610 --> 01:17:17.600
The answer is, why doesn't India
save its way out of constraints

01:17:17.600 --> 01:17:19.730
more quickly than they seem to?

01:17:23.320 --> 01:17:26.290
So there's discussion in
the literature about that.

01:17:26.290 --> 01:17:27.820
But here we do have constraints.

01:17:27.820 --> 01:17:29.890
It's just that
they're different.

01:17:29.890 --> 01:17:32.470
And essentially
what's going on here

01:17:32.470 --> 01:17:35.830
is you don't want to--
you don't want that wealth

01:17:35.830 --> 01:17:38.280
to move very fast.

01:17:38.280 --> 01:17:41.880
You're going to balance
off the incentives

01:17:41.880 --> 01:17:46.170
of today's consumption
versus tomorrow's wealth.

01:17:46.170 --> 01:17:48.570
Wealth moves a little bit,
depending on whether epsilon

01:17:48.570 --> 01:17:49.230
is high or low.

01:17:49.230 --> 01:17:50.980
But you don't want it
to move a whole lot.

01:17:50.980 --> 01:17:55.350
Because if it did, that's
the bulk of your utility.

01:17:55.350 --> 01:17:56.430
That's kind of very--

01:17:56.430 --> 01:17:59.640
that is actually
algebraically in the dual,

01:17:59.640 --> 01:18:02.940
equivalent with discounted
expected utility.

01:18:02.940 --> 01:18:05.820
And so if you move
that quickly, there's

01:18:05.820 --> 01:18:09.030
a big welfare loss
because of the concavity.

01:18:09.030 --> 01:18:11.530
So you don't want
it to move fast.

01:18:11.530 --> 01:18:14.700
So that's-- OK.

01:18:14.700 --> 01:18:18.720
And then if you look
at growth rates,

01:18:18.720 --> 01:18:22.890
the distribution of growth
rates looks like it's all zero.

01:18:22.890 --> 01:18:24.930
Actually, what the point
is, the growth rates

01:18:24.930 --> 01:18:26.610
are all very similar
to each other,

01:18:26.610 --> 01:18:29.280
because there isn't this big
dispersion in the moral hazard

01:18:29.280 --> 01:18:32.663
economy because they
don't move that fast.

01:18:32.663 --> 01:18:34.080
But a limited
commitment-- there's

01:18:34.080 --> 01:18:36.890
a huge dispersion
and growth rate.

01:18:36.890 --> 01:18:40.290
And you can imagine going to
data with this kind of stuff.

01:18:40.290 --> 01:18:42.670
We didn't look at
this in the data.

01:18:42.670 --> 01:18:44.970
But if you have Panel,
you can actually

01:18:44.970 --> 01:18:47.730
look not only at static
firm size distributions

01:18:47.730 --> 01:18:52.650
but the growth rates, and
get some evidence one way

01:18:52.650 --> 01:18:56.170
or the other for one friction.

01:18:56.170 --> 01:18:57.540
Then finally, the weekend--

01:19:00.090 --> 01:19:02.880
we've had a devil of
a time doing this.

01:19:02.880 --> 01:19:05.250
We start with the
whole economy subject

01:19:05.250 --> 01:19:07.590
to a limited
commitment constraint.

01:19:07.590 --> 01:19:12.450
And then we move it after 10
periods to a moral hazard.

01:19:12.450 --> 01:19:15.420
Now, this is meant to mimic
some kind of financial reform.

01:19:15.420 --> 01:19:17.430
If you want to be
generous with me,

01:19:17.430 --> 01:19:19.650
think of there being
two constraints,

01:19:19.650 --> 01:19:22.170
and then we managed
to get rid of one.

01:19:22.170 --> 01:19:23.880
Well, that's not quite
what we're doing.

01:19:23.880 --> 01:19:27.220
We kind of substitute limited
commitment for moral hazard.

01:19:27.220 --> 01:19:31.530
Basically, they get rid of
a constraining legal system,

01:19:31.530 --> 01:19:34.710
but it turns out that created
an information problem.

01:19:34.710 --> 01:19:38.570
Anyway, what's
really important is

01:19:38.570 --> 01:19:43.740
that you can actually look
at the transition dynamics.

01:19:48.100 --> 01:19:51.130
Well, let me just
show you the pictures.

01:19:51.130 --> 01:19:55.770
So here, you're
in a steady state,

01:19:55.770 --> 01:19:58.230
and then you do a
financial reform.

01:19:58.230 --> 01:19:59.280
But it's not like--

01:20:01.830 --> 01:20:06.060
Kaboski, they did-- they left
the financial structure intact,

01:20:06.060 --> 01:20:09.300
and they did real reforms.

01:20:09.300 --> 01:20:11.970
We're leaving everything in
the environment and everything

01:20:11.970 --> 01:20:14.790
intact and doing a
financial reform, hopefully

01:20:14.790 --> 01:20:18.150
in the spirit of what
Levine might have wanted.

01:20:18.150 --> 01:20:22.260
And then we see the implications
of that for deeper levels

01:20:22.260 --> 01:20:23.460
of capitalization.

01:20:23.460 --> 01:20:25.085
And look at the wage rate.

01:20:25.085 --> 01:20:29.310
It's no wonder we had
trouble finding it--

01:20:29.310 --> 01:20:31.710
pops up like that
instantaneously.

01:20:34.360 --> 01:20:38.320
Now, let me just say, these
things are not easy to compute.

01:20:38.320 --> 01:20:41.380
Because-- and [INAUDIBLE]
going to say something

01:20:41.380 --> 01:20:43.480
about that on Friday.

01:20:43.480 --> 01:20:46.030
Essentially, when you're
out of the steady state,

01:20:46.030 --> 01:20:49.610
you have to figure out
where you're going to go

01:20:49.610 --> 01:20:52.090
and how long it's going
to take to get there.

01:20:52.090 --> 01:20:54.280
And then you've got
to sort of guess

01:20:54.280 --> 01:20:57.700
about the paths of the
interest rates and the wages.

01:20:57.700 --> 01:21:00.730
And of course, any arbitrary
guess about how long it takes

01:21:00.730 --> 01:21:03.550
and how they're going to
move is quite arbitrary.

01:21:03.550 --> 01:21:05.830
So then you need
a systematic way

01:21:05.830 --> 01:21:09.460
to adjust period by period
to get in new guesses

01:21:09.460 --> 01:21:12.310
and then to try to iterate.

01:21:12.310 --> 01:21:16.450
[INAUDIBLE] managed to do it.

01:21:16.450 --> 01:21:17.320
We have their code.

01:21:17.320 --> 01:21:19.630
I've shared it
with many students

01:21:19.630 --> 01:21:21.850
working on related problems.

01:21:21.850 --> 01:21:25.180
It turned out that
their code, which

01:21:25.180 --> 01:21:28.090
is getting better and better
because they're playing around

01:21:28.090 --> 01:21:33.030
with it too, works for this
limited commitment better--

01:21:33.030 --> 01:21:34.890
much, much better than
it ever worked for us

01:21:34.890 --> 01:21:35.700
with moral hazard.

01:21:35.700 --> 01:21:37.890
We were quite
despondent about being

01:21:37.890 --> 01:21:40.620
able to compute the transitions.

01:21:40.620 --> 01:21:43.860
But evidently, now we're
in business on that.

01:21:51.220 --> 01:21:55.210
So the summary, back
to the big picture,

01:21:55.210 --> 01:21:58.060
is these obstacles matter.

01:21:58.060 --> 01:22:01.330
Ideally, I think,
if you can manage,

01:22:01.330 --> 01:22:05.740
use the microdata to try
to take a stand on what

01:22:05.740 --> 01:22:07.330
the frictions are.

01:22:07.330 --> 01:22:12.820
And through the dynamics
of Euler equations and debt

01:22:12.820 --> 01:22:17.930
overhang and so on, you'll
generate these dynamic paths.

01:22:17.930 --> 01:22:21.040
And they're going to
be general equilibrium

01:22:21.040 --> 01:22:23.680
consequences of the reforms.

01:22:23.680 --> 01:22:28.360
So it's like doing an
experiment on these economies

01:22:28.360 --> 01:22:29.870
to see what would happen.

01:22:29.870 --> 01:22:34.120
And this allows us to begin to
answer those questions I went

01:22:34.120 --> 01:22:37.870
over in the introductory lecture
about finance causes growth,

01:22:37.870 --> 01:22:38.830
but then what?

01:22:38.830 --> 01:22:40.330
What do we do?

01:22:40.330 --> 01:22:43.450
And how do we engineer it?

01:22:43.450 --> 01:22:45.110
And what would we
expect to happen?

01:22:45.110 --> 01:22:48.420
And are there winners
and losers, and so on?

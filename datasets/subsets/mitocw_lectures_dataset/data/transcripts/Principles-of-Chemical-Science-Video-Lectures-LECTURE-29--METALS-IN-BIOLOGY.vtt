00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:48.540
PROFESSOR: OK, let's just
take 10 more seconds

00:00:48.540 --> 00:01:02.950
on the clicker question.

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:09.650
OK, 76, I think that says, %,
which is not bad, but we

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.580
should be at 100%.

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:17.210
So, when you're past the
equivalence point, so you've

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.830
converted all of your weak,
in this case, acid to its

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:25.420
conjugate base, and because it
was a weak acid, the conjugate

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.550
base is going to be a weak
based and so it's not

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:31.900
contributing a whole lot it'll
make the solution basic, but

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.740
it's nothing compared to adding
strong base in there.

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.720
So even though you have the
weak base around, at this

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.320
point it's really a strong
base problem.

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.760
So you would calculate this by
looking at how many mils of

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.400
the strong base you've added
past, and figure out the

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.860
number of moles that there
are, and divide

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.460
by the total volume.

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.960
So this was like one of the
problems on the exam, and one

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.230
thing that I thought was
interesting on the exam is

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:03.200
that more people seemed to get
the hard problem right than

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.840
this, which was the
easy problem.

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.770
So we'll see on the final, there
will be an acid based

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.450
titration problem on the
final, at least one.

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.390
So let's see if we can get,
then, the easy and the hard

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:20.140
ones right.

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.770
So you've mastered the hard ones
and let's see if you can

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:29.100
learn how to do the easy ones
as well for the final exam.

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.390
OK, so we're going to continue
with transition metals.

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.040
We were talking about crystal
field theory and magnetism,

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.880
and you should have a handout
for today, and you should also

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:47.610
have some equipment to make
models of orbitals and

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.420
coordination complexes --
these are not snacks.

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:59.970
They can be snacks later, right
now they're a model kit.

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:05.440
All right, so I'm going to
introduce you to some terms

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.150
that we're going to come back
you at the end of today's

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.650
lecture, and then we're going
to talk about the shapes of

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.890
coordination complexes.

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.050
So, magnetism.

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:21.780
So we talked last time, before
the exam, if you remember,

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.130
about high spin and
low spin, unpaired

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.570
electrons and paired electrons.

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:29.700
Well, compounds that have
unpaired electrons are

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.850
paramagnetic, they're attracted
by a magnetic field,

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:36.580
and those where the electrons
are paired are diamagnetic are

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:38.560
repelled by a magnetic field.

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.450
So you can tell whether a
coordination complex is

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.110
paramagnetic or diamagnetic,
you can test the magnetism,

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:51.390
and that'll give you some
information about the electron

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:53.930
configuration of the
d orbitals in that

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:55.930
coordination complex.

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:59.380
And that can tell you
about the geometry.

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:02.280
And so you'll see that by the
end we're going to talk about

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.100
different types of energy
orbitals when you have

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:07.560
different geometries.

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.670
So why might you care about the

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:11.860
geometry of a metal center.

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:14.510
Well, people who study proteins
that have metal

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:17.350
centers care a lot about
the geometry of them.

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:20.280
So let me just give
you one example.

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:25.210
We talked a lot about energy in
the course this semester,

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:28.330
so we need catalysts for
removing carbon monoxide and

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.090
carbon dioxide from
the environment.

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:35.020
And nature has some of these --
they have metal cofactors

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.650
and proteins that can do this,
and people have been

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:40.730
interested in mimicking that
chemistry to remove these

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:43.060
gases from the environment.

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.380
So let me tell you these enzymes
are organisms. And

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:52.870
this is pretty amazing, some of
these microorganisms. So,

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:55.030
over here there's one
-- it basically

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:57.110
lives on carbon monoxide.

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:00.550
I mean that's -- you know
alternative sources of energy

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:02.710
are one thing, but that's really
quite a crazy thing

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:03.880
that this guy does.

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.840
So, you can grow it up in these
big vats and pump in

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:11.730
carbon monoxide and it's like
oh, food, and they grow and

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:14.690
multiply, and they're very,
very happy in this carbon

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:16.350
monoxide environment.

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:19.880
There are also microorganisms
that live on carbon dioxide as

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:23.120
their energy and a
carbon source.

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:27.120
And so these organisms have
enzymes in them that have

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.760
metal centers, and those metal
centers are responsible for

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:34.800
the ability of these organisms
to live on these kind of

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.820
bizarre greenhouse gases
and pollutants.

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:41.090
So people would like to
understand how this works.

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:43.870
So microbes have been estimated
to remove hundred, a

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:46.870
million tons of carbon monoxide
from the environment

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:50.640
every year, producing about
one trillion kilograms of

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:53.840
acetate from these
greenhouse gases.

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:56.600
And so, what do these catalysts
look like and these

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:59.340
enzymes, what do these metal
clusters look like that do

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:00.480
this chemistry.

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:03.990
And this was sort of a rough
model of what they look like,

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:06.820
and they thought it had iron and
sulfur and then a nickel

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:09.770
in some geometry, but they had
no idea sort of where the

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:12.590
nickel was and how it
was coordinated.

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:15.150
And so before there was any
kind of three dimensional

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:18.170
information, they used
spectroscopy, and they

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:21.110
considered whether it was
paramagnetic or diamagnetic to

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:24.070
get a sense of what the geometry
around the metal was.

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:26.300
So we're going to talk about
different coordination

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:30.860
geometries and how many unpaired
or paired electrons

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:33.930
you would expect, depending
on those geometries today.

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:38.220
And so, crystal field theory,
again, can help you help

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:42.190
explain/rationalize the
properties of these transition

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:46.350
metal complexes or coordination
complexes.

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:50.940
So, to help us think about
geometry, I always find for

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:54.810
myself that it's helpful
to have models.

00:06:54.810 --> 00:07:01.410
So not everyone can have such
large models as these, but you

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:06.580
can all have your own little
models of these geometries.

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:10.670
So, what we have available
to you are some mini

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:14.400
marshmallows, which, of course,
as we all know, are

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:19.160
representative of d orbitals,
and jelly beans, which we all

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:22.800
know are useful for making
coordination complexes.

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:27.580
So, what you can do with your
mini marshmallows is you can

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:30.610
put together to make your
different sets.

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:37.520
And so, over here we have -- oh,
actually it says gum drops

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:39.810
-- you don't have gum drops this
year, I changed up here,

00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:41.120
I forgot to change
it down here.

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:42.960
We have mini marshmallows.

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:47.440
Dr. Taylor went out and tried
to purchase enough gum drops

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:50.890
to do this experiment, and
discovered that Cambridge only

00:07:50.890 --> 00:07:54.580
had 300 gum drops,
so we have mini

00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:56.690
marshmallows instead today.

00:07:56.690 --> 00:07:57.850
But this gives you the idea.

00:07:57.850 --> 00:08:02.660
You can take one toothpick and
you can make d z squared,

00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:06.120
putting on your orbitals, you
have your donut in the middle,

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:09.500
and then your two lobes, which
run along the z-axis.

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:16.450
And then for your other sets
of orbitals, you can take

00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:21.800
these two toothpicks and put
on these sets of mini

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:26.620
marshmallows, and handily, you
can just have one for all of

00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:30.410
the other d orbitals, because
depending on how you hold it,

00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:32.910
it can represent all
of the other d

00:08:32.910 --> 00:08:35.190
orbitals just very well.

00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:38.240
So, you can just have one of
these for all the others and

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:40.330
then your d z squared.

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:44.410
So what we're going to do when
we have our orbitals set up,

00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:49.080
then we can think about how
ligands in particular

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:52.870
positions, in particular
geometries would clash with

00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:56.000
our orbitals -- where there'd
be big repulsions or small

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.230
repulsions.

00:08:59.230 --> 00:09:04.030
So, any other people missing
their jelly beans or their

00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:05.900
marshmallows?

00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:34.650
Please, raise your hand,
we have extras.

00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:36.870
So, those of you who have
them, go ahead and start

00:09:36.870 --> 00:10:08.730
making your d orbitals.

00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:54.410
All right, so if you're finished
with your two d

00:10:54.410 --> 00:11:01.990
orbitals, you can start making
an octahedral complex.

00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:05.670
So in your geometries set,
you'll have a big gum which

00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:11.100
can be your center metal --
you'll have a big jelly bean

00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:13.540
-- sorry, big jelly beans and
small jelly beans are our

00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:17.470
ligands, or our negative point
charges, and you can set up

00:11:17.470 --> 00:13:05.900
and make an octahedral
geometry here.

00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:10.610
OK, so as you're finishing this
up, I'm going to review

00:13:10.610 --> 00:13:13.480
what we talked about before the
exam -- so this isn't in

00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:15.820
today's lecture handouts, it
was in last time, which we

00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:17.100
already went over.

00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:20.040
But sometimes I've discovered
that when there's an exam in

00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:23.340
the middle, there needs to be
a bit of a refresher, it's

00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:28.470
hard to remember what happened
before the exam, and you have

00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:31.050
your models to think
about this.

00:13:31.050 --> 00:13:34.360
So, before the exam, we had
talked about the octahedral

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:38.850
case, and how compared to a
spherical situation where the

00:13:38.850 --> 00:13:41.080
ligands are everywhere
distributed around the metals

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:45.570
where all d orbitals would be
affected/repulsed by the

00:13:45.570 --> 00:13:50.580
ligands in a symmetric fashion
equally, when you have them

00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:54.580
put as particular positions in
geometry, then they're going

00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:57.000
to affect the different d
orbitals differently.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.600
And so, if you have your d z
squared made, and you have

00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:03.930
your octahedral made, you can
sort of hold these up and

00:14:03.930 --> 00:14:08.680
realize that you would have
repulsion from your ligands

00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:12.080
along the z-axis directly
toward your

00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:14.410
orbitals from d z squared.

00:14:14.410 --> 00:14:16.560
So that would be highly
repulsive.

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:20.490
The ligands are along the
z-axis, the d orbitals are

00:14:20.490 --> 00:14:23.580
along the z-axis, so the
ligands, the negative point

00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:25.100
charge ligands are going
to be pointing

00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:27.960
right toward your orbitals.

00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:34.000
And if you hold up this as a d
x squared y squared orbital

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.670
where the orbitals are right
along the x-axis and right

00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:41.660
along the y-axis and you hold
that up, remember, your

00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:43.720
ligands are right along
the x-axis and

00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:45.390
right along the y-axis.

00:14:45.390 --> 00:14:49.620
So, you should also have
significant repulsion for d x

00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:53.940
squared minus y squared, and
octahedrally oriented ligands.

00:14:53.940 --> 00:15:01.500
In contrast, the ligands set
that are 45 degrees off-axis,

00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:08.130
so d y z, d x z, and d x y,
they're all 45 degrees off.

00:15:08.130 --> 00:15:12.880
Your ligands are along the axis,
but your orbitals are 45

00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:14.610
degrees off-axis.

00:15:14.610 --> 00:15:16.840
So if you look at that together,
you'll see that

00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:19.530
whichever one you look at, the
ligands are not going to be

00:15:19.530 --> 00:15:22.210
pointing directly toward
those d orbitals.

00:15:22.210 --> 00:15:24.930
The orbitals are off-axis,
ligands are on-axis.

00:15:24.930 --> 00:15:29.790
So there will be much smaller
repulsions there.

00:15:29.790 --> 00:15:36.970
And that we talked about the
fact that for d x squared

00:15:36.970 --> 00:15:40.360
minus y squared and d z squared,
they're both have

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:43.410
experienced large repulsions,
they're both degenerate in

00:15:43.410 --> 00:15:47.010
energy, they go up in energy,
whereas these three d

00:15:47.010 --> 00:15:50.750
orbitals, smaller repulsion,
and they're also degenerate

00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:53.780
with respect to each other,
and they're stabilized

00:15:53.780 --> 00:15:55.420
compared to these
guys up here.

00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:58.680
So you can try to hold those up
and convince yourself that

00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:01.750
that's true for the
octahedral case.

00:16:01.750 --> 00:16:04.050
So, that's what we talked about
last time, and now we

00:16:04.050 --> 00:16:07.740
want to -- oh, and I'll just
remind you we looked at these

00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:09.950
splitting diagrams as well.

00:16:09.950 --> 00:16:13.010
We looked at the average energy
of the d orbitals -- d

00:16:13.010 --> 00:16:16.250
z squared and d x squared
minus y squared go up in

00:16:16.250 --> 00:16:18.970
energy, and then the
other three d

00:16:18.970 --> 00:16:24.310
orbitals go down in energy.

00:16:24.310 --> 00:16:28.250
So now we want to consider what
happens with different

00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:31.850
geometries.

00:16:31.850 --> 00:16:36.040
So now you can turn your
octahedral case into a square

00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:42.040
planar case, and how am
I going to do that?

00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:45.440
Yeah, so we can just take off
the top and the bottom and we

00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:51.910
have our nice square planar
case, and try to make a

00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:57.020
tetrahedral complex as well.

00:16:57.020 --> 00:16:59.450
And here's an example of
a tetrahedral one.

00:16:59.450 --> 00:17:02.200
Again, you can take a jelly bean
in the middle, and big

00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:05.070
jelly bean, and then the smaller
ones on the outside.

00:17:05.070 --> 00:17:08.560
So what angles am I going for
here in the tetrahedral case?

00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:10.590
109 .

00:17:10.590 --> 00:17:11.410
5.

00:17:11.410 --> 00:17:16.190
So you can go ahead and make
your tetrahedral complex, and

00:17:16.190 --> 00:17:17.890
don't worry so much
about the 0 .

00:17:17.890 --> 00:18:36.430
5, but we'll see if people can
do a good job with the 109.

00:18:36.430 --> 00:18:40.730
OK, how are your tetrahedral
complexes coming?

00:18:40.730 --> 00:18:46.660
Do they look like
this sort of?

00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:49.830
So let me define for you how
we're going to consider the

00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:52.090
tetrahedral case.

00:18:52.090 --> 00:18:56.860
So, in the tetrahedral case,
we're going to have the x-axis

00:18:56.860 --> 00:19:00.700
comes out of the plane, the
y-axis is this way, z-axis

00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:02.130
again, up and down.

00:19:02.130 --> 00:19:05.000
We're going to have one ligand
coming out here, another going

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.120
back, and then these two are
pretty much in the plane of

00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:09.140
the screen.

00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:11.510
So this is sort of how I'm
holding the tetrahedral

00:19:11.510 --> 00:19:18.420
complex with respect to the x,
z, and y coordinate system.

00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:21.910
So, there is a splitting, energy
splitting, associated

00:19:21.910 --> 00:19:25.050
with tetrahedral, and it's
going to be smaller than

00:19:25.050 --> 00:19:29.880
octahedral because none of these
ligands will be pointing

00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:31.510
directly toward the orbitals.

00:19:31.510 --> 00:19:36.590
But let's consider which
orbitals are going to be most

00:19:36.590 --> 00:19:42.850
affected by a tetrahedral
case.

00:19:42.850 --> 00:19:48.480
So, let's consider
d z squared.

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:49.780
What do you think?

00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:51.790
Is that going to be particularly
-- are the

00:19:51.790 --> 00:19:55.280
ligands pointing toward
d z squared?

00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:57.340
No.

00:19:57.340 --> 00:20:02.010
And d x squared minus y squared,
we can think of, what

00:20:02.010 --> 00:20:04.310
about that one?

00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:06.680
No, not really.

00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:12.320
What about d x y, d
y z, and d x y?

00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:17.090
Moreso.

00:20:17.090 --> 00:20:20.320
So, if you try holding up your
tetrahedral in our coordinate

00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:25.720
system, and then hold your d
orbitals 45 degrees off-axis,

00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:28.710
it's not perfect, they're not
pointing directly toward them,

00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:31.840
but it's a little closer than
for the d orbitals that are

00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:36.080
directly on-axis.

00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:41.180
So, if we look at this, we see
that the orbitals are going to

00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:46.230
be split in the exact opposite
way of the octahedral system.

00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:50.040
In the octahedral system, the
ligands are on-axis, so the

00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:53.940
orbitals that are on-axis, d x
squared minus y squared and d

00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:56.520
z squared are going to
be the most affected.

00:20:56.520 --> 00:21:00.170
But with tetrahedral, the
ligands are off-axis, so the d

00:21:00.170 --> 00:21:02.750
orbitals that are also off-axis
are going to be the

00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:03.820
most affected.

00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:06.720
But they're not going to be as
dramatically affected, so the

00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:09.980
splitting is actually smaller
in this case.

00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:14.030
So here, with tetrahedral, you
have the opposite of the

00:21:14.030 --> 00:21:16.080
octahedral system.

00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:19.690
And you can keep these and try
to convince yourself of that

00:21:19.690 --> 00:21:25.570
later if you have trouble
visualizing it.

00:21:25.570 --> 00:21:29.270
So, you'll have more repulsion
between the ligands as

00:21:29.270 --> 00:21:32.350
negative point charges, and
the d orbitals that are 45

00:21:32.350 --> 00:21:36.240
degrees off-axis than you do
with the two d orbitals that

00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:39.960
are on-axis.

00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:44.110
So here, d x squared minus y
squared and d z squared have

00:21:44.110 --> 00:21:46.720
the same energy with respect
to each other, they're

00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:47.980
degenerate.

00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:54.920
And we have our d y z, x z, and
x y have the same energy

00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:58.490
with respect to each other,
they are also degenerate.

00:21:58.490 --> 00:22:02.780
So it's the same sets that are
degenerate as with octahedral,

00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:08.480
but they're all affected
differently.

00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:13.660
So now let's look at the energy
diagrams and compare

00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:17.350
the octahedral system with
the tetrahedral system.

00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:21.280
Remember an octahedral, we had
the two orbitals going up and

00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:22.880
three going down.

00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:25.570
The splitting, the energy
difference between them was

00:22:25.570 --> 00:22:26.930
abbreviated.

00:22:26.930 --> 00:22:29.440
The octahedral crystal field
splitting energy, with a

00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:31.350
little o for octahedral.

00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:35.370
We now have a t for tetrahedral,
so we have a

00:22:35.370 --> 00:22:37.410
different name.

00:22:37.410 --> 00:22:41.000
And so here is now our
tetrahedral set.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:44.470
You notice it's the opposite of
octahedral, so the orbitals

00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:49.880
that were most destabilized in
the octahedral case are now

00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:54.190
more stabilized down here, so
we've moved down in energy.

00:22:54.190 --> 00:22:58.670
And the orbitals that are
off-axis, 45 degrees off-axis,

00:22:58.670 --> 00:23:02.670
which were stabilized in the
octahedral system, because

00:23:02.670 --> 00:23:05.430
none of ligands were pointing
right toward them, now those

00:23:05.430 --> 00:23:09.200
ligands are a bit closer so they
jump up in energy, and so

00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:15.260
we have this swap
between the two.

00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:18.760
So, we have some new
labels as well.

00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:24.390
So, we had e g up here as an
abbreviation for these sets of

00:23:24.390 --> 00:23:27.800
orbitals, and now that's
just referred to as e.

00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:32.140
Notice the book in one place has
an e 2, but uses e in all

00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:35.136
the other places, so just
use e, the e 2 was a

00:23:35.136 --> 00:23:36.440
mistake in the book.

00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:42.250
And then we have t 2 g
becomes t 2 up here.

00:23:42.250 --> 00:23:45.400
So we have this slightly
different nomenclature and we

00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:49.320
have this flip in direction.

00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:53.860
So, the other thing that is
important to emphasize is that

00:23:53.860 --> 00:23:57.520
the tetrahedral splitting energy
is smaller, because

00:23:57.520 --> 00:24:00.400
none of those ligands are
pointing directly toward any

00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:01.610
of the d orbitals.

00:24:01.610 --> 00:24:05.930
So here there is a much larger
difference, here there is a

00:24:05.930 --> 00:24:09.310
smaller difference, so that's
why it's written much closer

00:24:09.310 --> 00:24:14.300
together, so that's smaller.

00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:19.920
And because of that, many
tetrahedral complexes are high

00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:21.620
spin, and in this course,
you can assume that

00:24:21.620 --> 00:24:23.030
they're all high spin.

00:24:23.030 --> 00:24:25.400
So that means there's a weak
field, there's not a big

00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:31.540
energy difference between
those orbital sets.

00:24:31.540 --> 00:24:35.500
And again, we're going to --
since we're going to consider

00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:39.280
how much they go up and down in
energy, the overall energy

00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:40.480
is maintained.

00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:45.040
So here we had two orbitals
going up by 3/5, three

00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:47.770
orbitals going down by 2/5.

00:24:47.770 --> 00:24:50.600
So here, we have three orbitals
going up, so they'll

00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:54.490
go up in energy by 2/5, two
orbitals go down, so they'll

00:24:54.490 --> 00:24:57.580
be going down in
energy by 3/5.

00:24:57.580 --> 00:25:01.460
So again, it's the opposite
of the octahedral system.

00:25:01.460 --> 00:25:03.850
It's opposite pretty much in
every way except that the

00:25:03.850 --> 00:25:06.970
splitting energy is much
smaller, it's not as large for

00:25:06.970 --> 00:25:11.450
the tetrahedral complex.

00:25:11.450 --> 00:25:15.680
All right, so let's look at an
example, and we're going to

00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:20.190
consider a chromium, and like
we did before, we have to

00:25:20.190 --> 00:25:26.030
first figure out the d count,
so we have chromium plus 3.

00:25:26.030 --> 00:25:32.570
So what is our d count here?

00:25:32.570 --> 00:25:36.610
You know where chromium is, what
its group number -- here

00:25:36.610 --> 00:25:42.720
is a periodic table.

00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:45.420
So what is the d count?

00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:46.560
3.

00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:53.090
So we have 6 minus 3,
3 -- a d 3 system.

00:25:53.090 --> 00:25:58.490
And now, why don't you tell me
how you would fill in those

00:25:58.490 --> 00:26:02.880
three electrons in a
tetrahedral case.

00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:56.340
Have a clicker question there.

00:26:56.340 --> 00:27:00.040
So, notice that in addition to
having electron configurations

00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:02.140
that are different, the d
orbitals are labelled

00:27:02.140 --> 00:27:29.130
differently.

00:27:29.130 --> 00:27:44.020
OK, 10 more seconds.

00:27:44.020 --> 00:27:47.410
OK, very good, 80%.

00:27:47.410 --> 00:27:49.720
So, let's take a look at that.

00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:53.230
So down here, we're going to
have then our d x squared

00:27:53.230 --> 00:27:58.100
minus y squared, d z squared
orbitals up in the top, we

00:27:58.100 --> 00:28:05.420
have x y and x z and y z.

00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:10.320
Again, the orbitals that are
on-axis are repelled a little

00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:13.040
less than the orbitals
that are off-axis in

00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:14.690
a tetrahedral case.

00:28:14.690 --> 00:28:18.590
And then we put in our
electrons, we start down here.

00:28:18.590 --> 00:28:21.520
And then one of the questions
is do we keep down here and

00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:26.240
pair up or go up here, and
the answer is that

00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:27.670
you would go up here.

00:28:27.670 --> 00:28:31.330
Does someone want to tell me
why they think that's true?

00:28:31.330 --> 00:28:31.550
Yeah.

00:28:31.550 --> 00:28:33.930
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:33.930 --> 00:28:34.420
PROFESSOR: Right,
because it has a

00:28:34.420 --> 00:28:36.100
smaller splitting energy.

00:28:36.100 --> 00:28:38.530
So, the way that we were
deciding before with the weak

00:28:38.530 --> 00:28:41.500
field and the strong field, if
it's a weak field, it doesn't

00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:43.270
take much energy to
put it up there.

00:28:43.270 --> 00:28:45.780
So you go they don't want to
be paired, there's energy

00:28:45.780 --> 00:28:47.370
associated with pairing.

00:28:47.370 --> 00:28:50.990
But if there's a really huge
splitting energy, then it

00:28:50.990 --> 00:28:54.140
takes less energy to pair them
up before you go that big

00:28:54.140 --> 00:28:55.560
distance up there.

00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:58.570
But in tetrahedral cases, the
splitting energy's always

00:28:58.570 --> 00:29:02.690
small, so you're just going to
always fill them up singly to

00:29:02.690 --> 00:29:05.850
the fullest extent possible
before you pair.

00:29:05.850 --> 00:29:08.670
So this is like a weak field
case for the octahedral

00:29:08.670 --> 00:29:11.690
system, and all tetrahedral
complexes are sort of the

00:29:11.690 --> 00:29:14.430
equivalent of the weak field,
because the splitting energy

00:29:14.430 --> 00:29:17.640
is always small in an octahedral
case, because none

00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:20.570
of the ligands' negative point
charges are really pointing

00:29:20.570 --> 00:29:24.260
toward any of those orbitals
that much, so it's not that

00:29:24.260 --> 00:29:25.730
big a difference.

00:29:25.730 --> 00:29:30.300
So, here we have this and now we
can practice writing our d

00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:33.760
to the n electron
configuration.

00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:38.420
So what do I put here?

00:29:38.420 --> 00:29:42.280
What do I put first?

00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:46.460
So we put the e and then what?

00:29:46.460 --> 00:29:47.630
Yup.

00:29:47.630 --> 00:29:51.630
There are two electrons in the
e set of orbitals, and in the

00:29:51.630 --> 00:29:55.280
t 2 orbitals, there's one.

00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:59.040
So that is our d n electron
configuration.

00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:03.010
And then we're also asked how
many unpaired electrons.

00:30:03.010 --> 00:30:16.160
Unpaired electrons and
that is three.

00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:16.690
All right.

00:30:16.690 --> 00:30:21.680
So that's not too bad, that's
the tetrahedral case.

00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:23.350
The hardest part is
probably making

00:30:23.350 --> 00:30:27.710
your tetrahedral complex.

00:30:27.710 --> 00:30:31.350
Now square planar.

00:30:31.350 --> 00:30:34.430
So again, with the square
planar set you have your

00:30:34.430 --> 00:30:38.830
square planar model -- we have
a bigger one down here.

00:30:38.830 --> 00:30:43.260
And the axes is defined such
that we have ligands right

00:30:43.260 --> 00:30:46.780
along x -- one coming out at
you and one going back, and

00:30:46.780 --> 00:30:50.060
also ligands right
along the y-axis.

00:30:50.060 --> 00:30:53.470
So as defined then, we've gotten
rid of our ligands

00:30:53.470 --> 00:30:56.150
along the z-axis.

00:30:56.150 --> 00:30:57.740
So, what do you predict?

00:30:57.740 --> 00:31:04.320
Which two of these will be the
most destabilized now?

00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:05.650
What would be the most

00:31:05.650 --> 00:31:09.160
destabilized, what do you guess?

00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:13.300
You can hold up your
little sets here.

00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:16.140
What's the most destabilized,
what's going to go up the most

00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:19.740
in energy here?

00:31:19.740 --> 00:31:22.790
Yeah, d z squared
minus y squared.

00:31:22.790 --> 00:31:26.670
What do you predict might be
next, in terms of most

00:31:26.670 --> 00:31:29.110
unfavorable?

00:31:29.110 --> 00:31:30.990
Yeah, the x y one.

00:31:30.990 --> 00:31:35.380
So these two now are going to be
the most destabilized, with

00:31:35.380 --> 00:31:39.020
d x squared minus y squared
being a lot more destabilized

00:31:39.020 --> 00:31:42.260
than just the x y, because
again, those d orbitals are

00:31:42.260 --> 00:31:47.340
on-axis and these ligands
are on-axis.

00:31:47.340 --> 00:31:51.570
So, let's take a look at
all of these again.

00:31:51.570 --> 00:31:55.220
So in the octahedral case,
these were degenerate.

00:31:55.220 --> 00:31:59.190
That's no longer true, because
there are no ligands along the

00:31:59.190 --> 00:32:00.450
z-axis anymore.

00:32:00.450 --> 00:32:03.040
So we took those off in going
from the octahedral to the

00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:07.030
square planar, so you have much
less repulsion, but with

00:32:07.030 --> 00:32:11.010
the d x squared minus y squared,
you still have a lot

00:32:11.010 --> 00:32:12.620
repulsion.

00:32:12.620 --> 00:32:16.810
so then if we start building up
our case, and this diagram

00:32:16.810 --> 00:32:19.025
is, I think, on the next page of
your handout, but I'm going

00:32:19.025 --> 00:32:21.830
to start building it
all up together.

00:32:21.830 --> 00:32:26.300
So now d x squared, y squared
is really high up, it's very

00:32:26.300 --> 00:32:29.390
much more destabilized
than anybody else.

00:32:29.390 --> 00:32:32.280
D z squared, on the other
hand, is down.

00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:35.870
It's not -- it would be
stabilized compared -- it's

00:32:35.870 --> 00:32:40.560
not nearly as destabilized
as the other system.

00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:44.070
So then we go back and
look at these.

00:32:44.070 --> 00:32:49.820
You told me that d x y would
probably be next, and that's a

00:32:49.820 --> 00:32:50.730
very good guess.

00:32:50.730 --> 00:32:52.890
You see you have more repulsion
than in the other

00:32:52.890 --> 00:32:55.030
two, because the other
orbitals have some z

00:32:55.030 --> 00:32:56.450
component in them.

00:32:56.450 --> 00:33:00.100
So you have less repulsion
than d x squared minus y

00:33:00.100 --> 00:33:03.400
squared, because it's 45 degrees
off, but still that

00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:07.100
one is probably going to be up
a little bit more in energy

00:33:07.100 --> 00:33:08.830
than the other set.

00:33:08.830 --> 00:33:13.380
These two here are stabilized
compared to the others, so

00:33:13.380 --> 00:33:14.830
they're somewhere down here.

00:33:14.830 --> 00:33:18.950
Now the exact sort of
arrangement can vary a little

00:33:18.950 --> 00:33:22.840
bit, but the important points
are that the d x squared minus

00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:26.550
y squared is the most
destabilized, d x y would be

00:33:26.550 --> 00:33:31.120
next, and the other are
much lower in energy.

00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:34.250
And we're not going to do this
how much up and down thing,

00:33:34.250 --> 00:33:39.150
like the 3/5 and the 2/5 because
it's more complicated

00:33:39.150 --> 00:33:40.190
in this case.

00:33:40.190 --> 00:33:43.700
So just the basic rationale you
need to know here, not the

00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:52.520
exact energy differences in
this particular case.

00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:58.910
OK, so now we've thought about
three different kinds of

00:33:58.910 --> 00:34:00.910
geometries -- octahedral,
tetrahedral,

00:34:00.910 --> 00:34:02.450
and the square planar.

00:34:02.450 --> 00:34:07.910
You should be able to
rationalize, for any geometry

00:34:07.910 --> 00:34:10.310
that I give you, what
would be true.

00:34:10.310 --> 00:34:14.080
If I tell you the geometry and
how it compares with our

00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:18.800
frame, with our axis frame of
where the z-axis is, you

00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:21.660
should be able to tell me which
orbital sets would be

00:34:21.660 --> 00:34:24.140
the most destabilized.

00:34:24.140 --> 00:34:28.260
And to give you practice,
why don't you try

00:34:28.260 --> 00:34:29.660
this one right here.

00:34:29.660 --> 00:34:35.210
So we have a square pyramidal
case as drawn here with the

00:34:35.210 --> 00:34:40.440
axes labeled z, y and x, coming
in and coming out.

00:34:40.440 --> 00:34:46.940
Tell me which of the following
statements are true.

00:34:46.940 --> 00:34:51.760
And if you want, you can take
your square planar and turn it

00:34:51.760 --> 00:35:54.560
into the geometry
to help you out.

00:35:54.560 --> 00:36:10.150
Let's just take 10
more seconds.

00:36:10.150 --> 00:36:11.030
All right.

00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:13.510
That was good.

00:36:13.510 --> 00:36:15.590
People did well on
that question.

00:36:15.590 --> 00:36:25.180
So, if we consider that we had
the top two are correct.

00:36:25.180 --> 00:36:29.630
So, if we consider the d z
squared, now we've put a

00:36:29.630 --> 00:36:33.710
ligand along z, so that is going
to cause that to be more

00:36:33.710 --> 00:36:37.450
destabilized for this geometry
rather than square planar,

00:36:37.450 --> 00:36:42.250
which doesn't have anything in
the z direction. ah And then

00:36:42.250 --> 00:36:47.540
in terms, also, other orbitals
that have a component along z

00:36:47.540 --> 00:36:52.030
are going to be affected a
little bit by that, but our

00:36:52.030 --> 00:36:56.370
other one here is not going to
be true, so we just have all

00:36:56.370 --> 00:36:58.930
of the above is not correct,
so we have this one.

00:36:58.930 --> 00:37:02.730
So if we had up those, that's
actually a pretty good score.

00:37:02.730 --> 00:37:07.250
And so you could think about,
say, what would be true of a

00:37:07.250 --> 00:37:11.190
complex that was linear along
z, what would be the most

00:37:11.190 --> 00:37:13.320
stabilized, for example.

00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:16.540
So these are the kinds of
questions you can get, and I

00:37:16.540 --> 00:37:20.360
think there are a few
on the problem-set.

00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:24.850
All right, so let's come back
together now and talk about

00:37:24.850 --> 00:37:26.440
magnetism again.

00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:30.760
So, we said in the beginning
that magnetism can be used to

00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:35.090
figure out geometry in, say, a
metal cluster in an enzyme,

00:37:35.090 --> 00:37:39.180
and let's give an example of
how that could be true.

00:37:39.180 --> 00:37:44.050
So, suppose you have a nickel
plus 2 system, so that would

00:37:44.050 --> 00:37:49.150
be a d 8 system, so we have
group 10 minus 2 or d 8, and

00:37:49.150 --> 00:37:51.490
it was found to be
diamagnetic.

00:37:51.490 --> 00:37:56.210
And from that, we may be able to
guess, using these kinds of

00:37:56.210 --> 00:37:59.790
diagrams, whether it has
square planar geometry,

00:37:59.790 --> 00:38:03.410
tetrahedral geometry, or
octahedral geometry.

00:38:03.410 --> 00:38:08.690
We can predict the geometry
based on that information.

00:38:08.690 --> 00:38:11.690
Let's think about
how that's true.

00:38:11.690 --> 00:38:14.460
We have a d 8 system.

00:38:14.460 --> 00:38:17.510
Think about octahedral
for a minute.

00:38:17.510 --> 00:38:24.230
Are there two options for how
this might look in this case?

00:38:24.230 --> 00:38:26.360
Is there going to be a
difference in electron

00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:32.880
configurations if it's a weak
field or a strong field?

00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:36.790
So, write it out on your handout
and tell me whether it

00:38:36.790 --> 00:38:54.030
would be true, think
about it both ways.

00:38:54.030 --> 00:38:58.280
Is there a difference?

00:38:58.280 --> 00:39:00.650
So, you would end up getting
the same thing in this

00:39:00.650 --> 00:39:01.910
particular case.

00:39:01.910 --> 00:39:05.370
So if it's a weak field and you
put in 1, 2, 3, then jump

00:39:05.370 --> 00:39:09.810
up here, 4, 5, and then you have
to come back, 6, 7, 8.

00:39:09.810 --> 00:39:13.350
Or you could pair up all the
ones on the bottom first and

00:39:13.350 --> 00:39:16.550
then go up there, but you
actually get the same result

00:39:16.550 --> 00:39:19.430
no matter which way you
put them in, the

00:39:19.430 --> 00:39:21.430
diagram looks the same.

00:39:21.430 --> 00:39:24.190
So it doesn't matter in this
case if it is a weak or strong

00:39:24.190 --> 00:39:27.560
field, you end up with those
number of electrons with the

00:39:27.560 --> 00:39:31.870
exact same configuration.

00:39:31.870 --> 00:39:33.690
So, we know what that
looks like.

00:39:33.690 --> 00:39:36.050
Well, what about
square planar.

00:39:36.050 --> 00:39:38.860
So let's put our electrons
in there.

00:39:38.860 --> 00:39:41.590
We'll start at the bottom,
we'll just put them in.

00:39:41.590 --> 00:39:44.090
I'm not going to worry too much
about whether we can jump

00:39:44.090 --> 00:39:47.820
up or not, we'll just go and
pair them up as we go down

00:39:47.820 --> 00:39:51.140
here, and then go up here,
and now we've put

00:39:51.140 --> 00:39:52.560
in our eight electrons.

00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:56.730
So, how close these are, we're
just going to put them all in.

00:39:56.730 --> 00:39:59.540
We're just going to be very
careful not to bump up any

00:39:59.540 --> 00:40:04.540
electrons there unless we
absolutely have to, because d

00:40:04.540 --> 00:40:08.185
x squared minus y squared is
very much more destabilized in

00:40:08.185 --> 00:40:10.850
the square planar system, so
we're going to want to pair

00:40:10.850 --> 00:40:15.660
all our electrons up in those
lower energy orbitals.

00:40:15.660 --> 00:40:18.910
So even if we sort of did it
a different way, that's

00:40:18.910 --> 00:40:19.990
what we would get.

00:40:19.990 --> 00:40:22.990
So we're going to want to pair
everything up before we go up

00:40:22.990 --> 00:40:25.220
to that top one there.

00:40:25.220 --> 00:40:26.460
So there's our square planar.

00:40:26.460 --> 00:40:28.040
Well, what about tetrahedral.

00:40:28.040 --> 00:40:31.680
How are we going to
fill these up?

00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:37.070
Do we want to pair first, or we
do want to put them to the

00:40:37.070 --> 00:40:40.290
full extent possible singly?

00:40:40.290 --> 00:40:42.820
Single, right, it's going to be
a weak field, there's not a

00:40:42.820 --> 00:40:45.900
big splitting here between
these, so we'll put them in,

00:40:45.900 --> 00:40:53.050
there's 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

00:40:53.050 --> 00:40:55.420
All right, so now we can
consider which of these will

00:40:55.420 --> 00:40:58.120
be paramagnetic and which
will be diamagnetic.

00:40:58.120 --> 00:41:01.960
What's octahedral?

00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:05.000
It's paramagnetic, we have
unpaired electrons.

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:08.350
What about square planar?

00:41:08.350 --> 00:41:10.350
Square planar's diamagnetic.

00:41:10.350 --> 00:41:11.930
And what about tetrahedral?

00:41:11.930 --> 00:41:14.610
Paramagnetic.

00:41:14.610 --> 00:41:20.180
So, if the experimental data
told us that a nickel center

00:41:20.180 --> 00:41:23.600
in an enzyme was diamagnetic,
and we were trying to decide

00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:26.720
between those three geometries,
it really seems

00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:31.400
like square planar is going
to be our best guess.

00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:34.820
And so, let me show you
an example of a

00:41:34.820 --> 00:41:39.040
square planar system.

00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:44.910
And so this particular nickel is
in a square planar system.

00:41:44.910 --> 00:41:50.340
It has four ligands that are all
in the same plane, and it

00:41:50.340 --> 00:41:53.380
is a square planar center
for a nickel,

00:41:53.380 --> 00:41:54.770
so that's one example.

00:41:54.770 --> 00:41:57.510
And this is a cluster
that's involved in

00:41:57.510 --> 00:42:01.280
life on carbon dioxide.

00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:04.480
All right, so that's different
geometries,

00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:05.750
you're set with that.

00:42:05.750 --> 00:42:09.230
Monday we're going to talk about
colors of coordination

00:42:09.230 --> 00:42:11.660
complexes, which all have
to do with the different

00:42:11.660 --> 00:42:15.140
geometries, paired and unpaired
electrons, high

00:42:15.140 --> 00:42:19.300
field, low spin, strong
field, weak field.

00:42:19.300 --> 00:42:21.020
Have a nice weekend.

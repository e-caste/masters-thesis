JOE HADZIMA: OK.

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.810
The second part of
tonight is going

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:31.080
to deal with legal issues.

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.130
And the first thing I
have to caution you on

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:41.241
is-- whoops, what happened.

00:00:41.241 --> 00:00:42.530
I take that back.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.920
I didn't start at the beginning.

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.370
This is background for education
only and it's not legal advice.

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.440
Have to say that.

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.150
One of the things is that law
stuff is very fact specific.

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:00.450
So anything that I
tell you here now

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:02.100
could change based on the facts.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.840
And the law could change too.

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.840
What I'm going to do is
go through an awful lot

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.920
of slides covering a whole
bunch of areas of law

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.310
related to startups.

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.280
And I put on a
website-- the Deck.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.180
You can get that
now if you want.

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.160
What I'd like you to
do is I'm going to try

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:23.610
to point out the big issues.

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.280
And at the end of the day,
it's more like an issue

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.220
spotting thing.

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.350
Will you recognize things
as you encounter them

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.650
so that you have a
framework to have

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:35.990
a discussion with
your legal adviser,

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:37.210
with your team, et cetera.

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:39.140
So we're going to go
to a pretty good clip.

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.930
I'll try to take questions
but I reserve the right

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.410
to sort of push through.

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:47.270
So it's about legal issues.

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.731
I'll see if I get
this thing working.

00:01:49.731 --> 00:01:50.230
Sorry.

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.380
First of all, do we have
any lawyers in the audience?

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.810
Uh-oh.

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:00.320
One lawyer.

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.290
OK.

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:01.790
All right.

00:02:05.044 --> 00:02:06.710
[INAUDIBLE] came up
with this great idea

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.870
that I did last year--
is to take the life

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:13.260
cycle of the business and to
look at it through various sets

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.900
of layers here.

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.990
Starting with intellectual
property, legal entity, people,

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:19.060
and financing.

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:24.780
And across from pre- idea stage
all the way through financing.

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.470
So we're going to
walk through that.

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.910
And the first stage is going
to be the intellectual property

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:32.620
stage.

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:33.960
And it's the idea part.

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:40.240
And the question is who
owns the IP for the venture.

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.894
And then the pre-
outside financing

00:02:43.894 --> 00:02:45.060
is, how do you protect that.

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.980
So that's the theme
for this part.

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.390
Now how do we relate
to a business plan.

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.440
And this is Fiona
Murray's Four Key Ideas

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.560
for Startups The first is
controlling the knowledge

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:59.640
underlying an invention.

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.560
If that's important to
your business success,

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.580
that's one of the
keys to startup.

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.120
The second is secrecy.

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:11.460
Maybe nobody else knows
exactly how you do what you do.

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:12.540
The third is speed.

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.950
Even with that other stuff
you need to move quickly.

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.740
And that could be a real
key advantage-- an idea.

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:19.177
And the fourth
thing-- in thinking

00:03:19.177 --> 00:03:21.010
about intellectual
property-- is there a way

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.660
you could lock in customers.

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:25.406
The way you go
about dealing with

00:03:25.406 --> 00:03:26.530
your intellectual property.

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.650
And then how can that help
you in your business plan.

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.840
Well first of all, IP
is a valuable asset

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.630
and you can use it
to raise capital.

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.000
One of the issues
with a lot of IP

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.610
is the investors don't
really understand what it is.

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.010
But they think it's important.

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.280
And so if you don't
have some, they're

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.394
going to be questioning,
why aren't you

00:03:49.394 --> 00:03:50.310
doing something there.

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.660
So it's really a combination
of, is this important to you

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:56.280
and have you thought about it.

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:02.240
Now there is correlation
between IP and success.

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:04.980
I did a study-- it was published
in the Intellectual Asset

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:10.580
Management publication-- in
which we run these analyzes

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:12.190
on venture backed companies.

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:16.130
We run about 9,000 companies
through the set of metrics.

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:20.079
And we took five top funds.

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:27.660
Kleiner Perkins, New
Enterprise, Domain-- and we

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:32.730
looked at patents
and we said, if we

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:35.730
were to try to figure out
which companies had IP

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:39.660
and how good was their IP and
what was there success rates.

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.170
We look at the
portfolios and said,

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:43.540
well we know some companies
have been acquired

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:45.810
or they've gone public.

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:46.710
Those are winners.

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:49.020
And some companies
are out of business.

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:50.270
They failed.

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:52.280
And then a bunch of
the other companies--

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.220
we don't know where
they are from a thing.

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:56.680
And what we did is we
looked at our rankings

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.370
based on analyzing IP.

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:03.410
And it turned out to 86%
of the winners scored high

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:05.410
in their patent strategy.

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:07.960
Which is sort of
interesting when you think.

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:11.980
The Kleiner Perkins success
rate is one out of three.

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:15.270
That is one out of
every three investments

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:17.980
that they make turns
out to be a success.

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:20.160
And they've got the best
track record out there.

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:24.910
So IP can really
correlate with success.

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:26.430
The other thing
people look at is

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:28.620
you can establish that
you are a good manager

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:31.070
of your technology.

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:35.210
And that can help you in
on your business plan.

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:37.600
Now I'm going to run two
different types of IP

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:40.970
protection, starting with none.

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:43.850
And then trademark, copyright,
trade secret, patent,

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:46.620
and combination.

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:49.080
Now trademark and
copyright-- I'll

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.210
get into more detail--
but basically these

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:53.370
are things that can
enhance your value.

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:55.020
But they don't
necessarily block others

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:58.160
from doing what you're doing.

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.300
Whereas trade secret
can prevent others.

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:04.480
If they don't know how you
do it, they can't do it.

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:07.900
And then patent is sort
of a combination of both.

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:09.950
Because in order to get
a patent, as you'll see,

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:11.949
you have to actually
disclose what you're doing.

00:06:11.949 --> 00:06:14.030
So you're telling
people the secret sauce

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:16.570
but you get some
rights in return.

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:19.990
And then in some cases you get
combinations of protections.

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:25.280
Like software can be protected
by copyright and by patent.

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:27.820
So trademarks, what
are these things.

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:31.250
Well basically a
trademark is-- it can

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:34.150
be a name, a symbol, a sound.

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:36.360
Harley Davidson
actually trademarked

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:38.450
the sound of the vroom vroom.

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:41.990
Color pink for insulation
is Owens Corning.

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:44.930
And what it is--
it's something that

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:51.290
tells a consumer that you're the
source of that good or service.

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:55.600
So if I say Mercedes-Benz, you
have an image of what it is.

00:06:55.600 --> 00:07:00.730
So it connects the customer
with a particular source.

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:02.472
And it can be all
sorts of things.

00:07:02.472 --> 00:07:03.930
It can be a house
mark, which would

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:09.330
be IBM or Virtual Inc, which
is sort of the company names.

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:11.100
It can be a product mark.

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:13.600
Like ThinkPad used to be IBM.

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:16.040
Now a Lenovo product.

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:20.130
And Mimio was the
virtual ink one.

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:24.900
The rights you get from
trademark arise through use.

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:27.640
And if you register it you
get a whole bunch of benefits.

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:30.280
And it's not very
expensive process to do it.

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:32.470
You should use a fanciful name.

00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:35.780
So who would have thought
Apple for a computer.

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:38.700
That's a strong mark.

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:41.070
Don't pick something
that's merely descriptive,

00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:48.080
like storage technology or
analog devices as a mark.

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:51.670
And for the business plan, if
you're putting it together,

00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:54.230
you can actually check on
the availability of a mark

00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:59.970
by going to the USPTO and you
can search for a mark name.

00:07:59.970 --> 00:08:02.530
Any questions on that so far?

00:08:02.530 --> 00:08:05.480
OK, so the next
one is copyright.

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:08.440
So copyright is
basically the right

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:11.620
to prevent others from
making copies of what you do.

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:13.700
And it rises just
from creating a work.

00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:15.370
So if I write a
letter to my mother,

00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:18.910
I have a copyright in that.

00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:21.610
Federal registration
is a plus in terms

00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:24.780
of the ability to enforce that.

00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:28.090
It protects the expression,
not the function.

00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:32.650
So I can actually copyright
my exact code in software.

00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:35.730
But I can't, through copyright,
prevent somebody else

00:08:35.730 --> 00:08:38.164
from looking at the
code and writing

00:08:38.164 --> 00:08:40.580
equivalent kind of things, as
long as they are not exactly

00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:41.260
copying it.

00:08:44.027 --> 00:08:45.610
Now for a business
plan, the key thing

00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:50.040
with copyright that people
trip over is who owns it.

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:55.980
The owner of a copyright
is the author of the work,

00:08:55.980 --> 00:09:00.360
be it software, a
document, or whatever.

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:03.420
It's the author.

00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:07.700
Now unless that
author is an employee

00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:11.750
and is generating that in
the course of employment.

00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:14.570
So if you go and hire an
independent contractor

00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:17.800
to write code for
you, don't own it,

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:19.924
even though you paid for it.

00:09:19.924 --> 00:09:21.340
And so you've got
to make sure you

00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:26.630
have an assignment of
ownership of that work to you.

00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:28.410
Or when the investors
come in and they

00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:30.920
do their due diligence,
they're going to say,

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:32.860
you don't actually own it.

00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:35.060
I had a case back
in my law days where

00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:37.490
someone paid over a half
million dollars for code

00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:40.450
and couldn't actually
get ownership of it

00:09:40.450 --> 00:09:42.880
because he hadn't protected it.

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:46.671
And I also mentioned here, look
at open source as an issue.

00:09:46.671 --> 00:09:48.170
Where you're using
open source, make

00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:52.050
sure you're complying with
the license for open source.

00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:55.280
Because investors, when they
come in-- you do all this work,

00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:57.416
you do your pitch.

00:09:57.416 --> 00:09:59.290
They send in the troops
to look you over then

00:09:59.290 --> 00:10:02.154
they find these landmines
you've planted there

00:10:02.154 --> 00:10:03.320
that you could have avoided.

00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:06.830
So keep that in mind.

00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:09.390
Now trade secret
is what it says.

00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:12.721
It's a secret it's something
that gives you, hopefully,

00:10:12.721 --> 00:10:14.970
an unfair competitive advantage
that nobody else knows

00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:15.540
how to do.

00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:19.480
And the most famous one is
the formula for Coca Cola.

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:22.260
Which, I don't know whether
chemically you could figure it

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.240
out-- apparently nobody has.

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:25.630
But that's an example.

00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:29.300
It's been a secret
for a long time.

00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:30.020
I should back up.

00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:32.480
A copyright is
effectively a long time.

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:35.170
It's like 75 years.

00:10:35.170 --> 00:10:38.220
Trademark is indefinite as
long as you keep renewing it.

00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:40.900
Trade secret is indefinite
until it's finally

00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:42.540
out there in the world.

00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:46.250
So you protect trade
secrets through

00:10:46.250 --> 00:10:47.867
non-disclosure
agreements, if you're

00:10:47.867 --> 00:10:49.450
going to actually
have to describe it,

00:10:49.450 --> 00:10:51.760
or you just don't
tell people about it.

00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:58.330
I think I'll just
leave it at that point

00:10:58.330 --> 00:11:02.020
The sort of big gorilla in
the IP spaces is patents.

00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:05.090
Because they have much
stronger rights that you get.

00:11:05.090 --> 00:11:07.750
They're more expensive to get,
but they're stronger rights.

00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:11.720
So a patent is really a
limited time monopoly.

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:14.100
And we don't really like
monopolies in the US.

00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:16.130
We have antitrust laws.

00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:17.790
But in this case--
societal benefit,

00:11:17.790 --> 00:11:19.414
it goes right back
to the Constitution.

00:11:19.414 --> 00:11:22.450
It says, look, we're going
to get ahead as a society

00:11:22.450 --> 00:11:25.680
if an inventor will
tell us how he did it.

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:29.150
And in exchange, we'll give
the inventor a limited time

00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:33.490
monopoly to prevent others
from doing something.

00:11:33.490 --> 00:11:35.660
It has to be applied for.

00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:37.820
In the US, that's with
the patent office.

00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:40.270
These patents are
country by country.

00:11:40.270 --> 00:11:44.420
In fact, most of these IP
rights are country by country.

00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:45.540
Now, what do you get.

00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:49.140
Well, it's very much
like real estate.

00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:50.630
The fundamental
right-- and we'll

00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:52.730
go into a little more
detail in a moment--

00:11:52.730 --> 00:11:55.650
is the right to prevent
people from trespassing

00:11:55.650 --> 00:11:57.740
on your invention.

00:11:57.740 --> 00:11:59.790
So if you own a
piece of real estate,

00:11:59.790 --> 00:12:02.270
your fundamental
right is, if I own

00:12:02.270 --> 00:12:05.650
it and you walk on my
property, I can kick you off.

00:12:05.650 --> 00:12:08.000
Call the police,
get off my property.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.810
And that's essentially
what a patent does.

00:12:10.810 --> 00:12:12.810
The way it does that is
you could prevent others

00:12:12.810 --> 00:12:16.910
from making, using, selling,
importing, and distributing

00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:18.160
your invention.

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:21.170
So you can't take something
that's patented in the US,

00:12:21.170 --> 00:12:24.040
take it to a third, a
second, another country,

00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:26.590
make it and bring
it back into the US.

00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:28.960
That would be an infringement.

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:32.990
Now the ownership of a patent
is not necessarily the right

00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:34.310
to use it.

00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:36.627
That's a hard one
to think about.

00:12:36.627 --> 00:12:37.460
What does that mean.

00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:39.040
Well, think about real estate.

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:41.390
If my fundamental right
is, I can keep you

00:12:41.390 --> 00:12:43.240
from walking on my
land, does that mean

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:46.360
I can actually use my land.

00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:47.280
Well, maybe not.

00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:52.570
Suppose I have to walk across
your land to get to my land.

00:12:52.570 --> 00:12:55.010
I might not actually
be able to use my land

00:12:55.010 --> 00:12:56.950
but I can certainly
keep you off of it.

00:12:56.950 --> 00:12:58.160
And so that's the analogy.

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:00.790
Some people think that
it's a right to use.

00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:03.830
It's really a right to exclude.

00:13:03.830 --> 00:13:06.320
And the claims in the
patent are like the fence

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:07.930
around the property.

00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:10.660
So those to find what
the legal property

00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:13.600
is that you can
keep people out of.

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:15.680
And the duration is
20 years from the date

00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:18.150
of filing under the new rules.

00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:27.260
Now what do you have
to do to get a patent.

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:30.170
It has to be
something new, novel.

00:13:30.170 --> 00:13:33.610
And to get it, you have
to show the examiner.

00:13:33.610 --> 00:13:36.130
You make a filing
with the patent office

00:13:36.130 --> 00:13:38.420
and you have to
tell the examiner

00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:40.630
how yours is different from
what else is out there.

00:13:40.630 --> 00:13:42.060
Let's call prior art.

00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:44.360
So you have to cite prior art.

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:46.370
So it has to be useful, also.

00:13:46.370 --> 00:13:49.680
That's not really an
issue for most patents.

00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:51.390
There's some pretty
un-useful things that

00:13:51.390 --> 00:13:54.250
have been patented out there.

00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:56.170
It has to be patentable
subject matter, which

00:13:56.170 --> 00:13:59.150
is this whole thing we're
seeing now with business method

00:13:59.150 --> 00:14:03.270
patents that I won't
go into any detail on.

00:14:03.270 --> 00:14:05.820
And it can't
previously have been

00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:09.020
sold or publicly described.

00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:12.160
In the US you have
a one year window

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:15.710
from the time you publicly
describe your invention

00:14:15.710 --> 00:14:21.070
or you put on the
market for sale.

00:14:21.070 --> 00:14:24.390
You have one year in which you
get an application on file.

00:14:24.390 --> 00:14:28.640
And if you don't, you won't be
able to get a patent at all.

00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:32.900
Now the public description has
to be an enabling description.

00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:35.100
So it has to be something
that actually explains it.

00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:36.670
So if I stood here
and said, I've

00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:39.770
got this invention for
anti-gravity boots,

00:14:39.770 --> 00:14:42.730
I haven't told you anything
about how it's done.

00:14:42.730 --> 00:14:44.290
So it has to be enabling.

00:14:44.290 --> 00:14:47.750
Now the other
requirement is that what

00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:50.500
you're trying to patent has
to be not obvious to one

00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:53.720
of ordinary skill in the art.

00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:57.720
Now the word is ordinary
skill in the art.

00:14:57.720 --> 00:15:00.360
I had a MIT professor
who decided, well,

00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:03.860
this was sort of-- anybody
could have figured this out.

00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:06.940
Because he was used to dealing
at MIT professor level.

00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:08.190
And so I said, I'm not sure.

00:15:08.190 --> 00:15:09.898
You better go check
with a patent lawyer.

00:15:09.898 --> 00:15:11.890
And sure enough, it was
not something anyone

00:15:11.890 --> 00:15:14.550
with an ordinary skill would
have been able to figure out.

00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:20.000
Examples of overcoming that
part is that the prior art

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.640
teaches against it.

00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:23.880
Other people say
it can't be done.

00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:26.150
And you've shown it or
its commercial success.

00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:27.850
Bob Langer does a
great story about some

00:15:27.850 --> 00:15:31.000
of his early patents,
where he came in and showed

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:31.740
the examiner.

00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:36.020
Look, if it was so obvious,
how come nobody else did it.

00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:36.640
Nobody else.

00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:38.820
And here are some papers
that said it can't be done.

00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:41.750
And that's how he overcame
his original set of issues.

00:15:45.002 --> 00:15:46.710
I hear a question?

00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:49.530
OK.

00:15:49.530 --> 00:15:51.044
In the back, yes.

00:15:51.044 --> 00:15:52.294
AUDIENCE: Not previously sold.

00:15:52.294 --> 00:15:54.377
Does that mean not previously
sold by anyone else?

00:15:54.377 --> 00:15:57.134
Or can you not sell it
until you have the patent?

00:15:57.134 --> 00:15:58.300
JOE HADZIMA: Let me go back.

00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:00.230
I said it was one
year in the US.

00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:02.760
I should also mention in
the rest of the world,

00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:06.720
if you disclose or offer
for sale before you file,

00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:09.760
you won't be able to get a
patent in any other country.

00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:12.260
AUDIENCE: One year is
from the first time you--

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:16.400
JOE HADZIMA: Either publicly
disclose or hold out for sale.

00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:16.900
Yeah.

00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:20.560
And there are a lot of nuances
on the hold out for sale.

00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:22.000
The purpose of
going through this

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.291
is I want you know sort of
what the general issues are.

00:16:24.291 --> 00:16:25.780
And so you'll think about it.

00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:27.919
Oh, maybe we ought
to get that-- if we

00:16:27.919 --> 00:16:29.460
want to have a
patent, maybe we ought

00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:33.830
to go talk to someone before
we take it to a demo day

00:16:33.830 --> 00:16:36.680
and blow our chances.

00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:42.125
AUDIENCE: So does public
disclosure include things

00:16:42.125 --> 00:16:46.580
like telling your peers in a lab
or telling students in a class?

00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:53.510
And also, if you
[INAUDIBLE] use an object

00:16:53.510 --> 00:16:56.975
in [INAUDIBLE]
without revealing how

00:16:56.975 --> 00:17:01.322
one goes from input to
output-- is that a disclosure?

00:17:01.322 --> 00:17:02.280
JOE HADZIMA: All right.

00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:05.260
So the question is,
is a public disclosure

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:07.339
if you talk to your
lab mates or you do it

00:17:07.339 --> 00:17:09.690
in the confines of
an academic setting.

00:17:09.690 --> 00:17:11.650
Sort of a closed
kind of setting.

00:17:11.650 --> 00:17:14.300
And in general,
yes, but you want

00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:15.900
to be very careful about that.

00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:23.760
It's one of those facts and
circumstances type things.

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:25.550
There is an exception
to the holding

00:17:25.550 --> 00:17:30.070
out for sale for experimental
use of something.

00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:32.700
But again, the point
here is you don't

00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:34.410
want to rely on
these after the fact.

00:17:34.410 --> 00:17:37.190
You want to, if you're planning
some activities where you think

00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:39.340
it's really important
about a patent,

00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:41.790
make sure you know what the
exact rule is at that time.

00:17:41.790 --> 00:17:44.950
Because it could change
next week with a court case.

00:17:44.950 --> 00:17:47.019
These are just red
flag type things.

00:17:47.019 --> 00:17:48.560
AUDIENCE: What about
the second half?

00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:49.935
Where if you're
demoing something

00:17:49.935 --> 00:17:53.151
but you give no indication of
what it's worth [INAUDIBLE].

00:17:53.151 --> 00:17:55.650
JOE HADZIMA: So the question
is, if you're demoing something

00:17:55.650 --> 00:17:58.024
and you don't explain how it
works, is that a disclosure.

00:17:58.024 --> 00:18:00.680
It's actually been held
that way in some cases.

00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:04.050
Where you actually couldn't
see the actual device.

00:18:04.050 --> 00:18:07.970
So again, my point
is, think about ahead

00:18:07.970 --> 00:18:11.300
of time and with
the given facts,

00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:13.580
make sure you get some good
advice before you go off

00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:17.910
and do it and then wish you had
thought about it ahead of time.

00:18:17.910 --> 00:18:18.410
OK.

00:18:18.410 --> 00:18:21.510
So let me keep moving.

00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:22.535
Oops, let's see.

00:18:26.850 --> 00:18:28.990
Same issue from a
business plan viewpoint.

00:18:28.990 --> 00:18:30.570
Do you actually
own the technology.

00:18:30.570 --> 00:18:35.660
So a patent issues in
the name of an inventor.

00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:39.012
And a company only gets it
if the inventor assigns it.

00:18:39.012 --> 00:18:41.470
So if you're a technical person,
you go work for a company,

00:18:41.470 --> 00:18:43.660
you probably end up signing
an invention disclosure

00:18:43.660 --> 00:18:45.890
agreement and an assignment.

00:18:45.890 --> 00:18:48.980
So if you invent something
in the course of your work,

00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:50.657
you agree the employer owns it.

00:18:50.657 --> 00:18:52.490
And if you're a startup
and you hire people,

00:18:52.490 --> 00:18:55.632
you want to have something
along those lines also.

00:18:55.632 --> 00:18:57.340
You could in-license
from the university.

00:18:57.340 --> 00:19:01.130
I'll tell you a little bit about
MIT and how it works there.

00:19:01.130 --> 00:19:04.460
And did you let it go
into the public domain.

00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:06.905
In other words, did you screw
up these one year rules.

00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:10.170
OK.

00:19:10.170 --> 00:19:12.980
Now obtaining a patent
involves sort of four steps.

00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:15.460
In Determining what to patent.

00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:16.970
Determining when to file.

00:19:16.970 --> 00:19:18.490
You got to prepare
the applications.

00:19:18.490 --> 00:19:20.670
And then you've got
to prosecute it,

00:19:20.670 --> 00:19:24.120
which means you negotiate
with the Patent Office

00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:25.462
about getting a patent.

00:19:25.462 --> 00:19:26.795
And that can take several years.

00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:32.650
Determining what the patent
really is more about not

00:19:32.650 --> 00:19:34.540
what can I get a patent on.

00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:35.600
Its what's useful.

00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:38.660
Because patents are
pretty expensive.

00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:41.270
And you probably don't
have enough money

00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:44.614
to patent everything
you actually invent.

00:19:44.614 --> 00:19:46.780
And when you say, what do
I want to get a patent on,

00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:48.250
you say, well, what
value does it add.

00:19:48.250 --> 00:19:50.624
Remember we talked about we
want to create value-- that's

00:19:50.624 --> 00:19:53.000
part of the mission here.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:54.410
If I patent this,
is it valuable.

00:19:54.410 --> 00:19:55.910
Does it create commercial value.

00:19:55.910 --> 00:20:00.410
Does it prevent
competitors from using it.

00:20:00.410 --> 00:20:03.082
And in determining whether
it has commercial value

00:20:03.082 --> 00:20:05.290
or not, or whether you can
easily get a patent on it,

00:20:05.290 --> 00:20:08.602
you want to compare
against the prior art.

00:20:08.602 --> 00:20:11.060
So this is where I get to do
a little pitch for the company

00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:13.660
that I founded called IP Vision.

00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:16.630
We were doing early stage
technology commercialization

00:20:16.630 --> 00:20:17.810
out of MIT.

00:20:17.810 --> 00:20:20.850
And the problem we had doing
the same kind of things

00:20:20.850 --> 00:20:24.340
we're talking about
in class-- market,

00:20:24.340 --> 00:20:26.525
time to market, what's the
strategy-- is we always

00:20:26.525 --> 00:20:27.900
had a problem
figuring out what's

00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:29.602
the intellectual property.

00:20:29.602 --> 00:20:31.185
And the only way we
could really do it

00:20:31.185 --> 00:20:34.720
was try to read a ton of patents
or send it out to a law firm.

00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:36.580
And we get back a
real thick report.

00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:40.340
It was perfectly accurate,
but not very helpful.

00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:44.270
So we invented our own way
to map out the IP space.

00:20:44.270 --> 00:20:46.770
And this is an example
of our landing page.

00:20:46.770 --> 00:20:49.630
The free version is
at see-the-forest.com,

00:20:49.630 --> 00:20:52.362
with hyphens in-between there.

00:20:52.362 --> 00:20:53.320
There's a free version.

00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:55.100
And for people in
the MIT community,

00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:58.500
we give free upgrades to
premium while you're working

00:20:58.500 --> 00:20:59.550
on your plans and stuff.

00:20:59.550 --> 00:21:01.310
So check it out
and I'll show you

00:21:01.310 --> 00:21:04.100
an example of what
it looks like.

00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:09.340
This is Virtual Inks, one
of its key first patents.

00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:10.560
And this is a patent map.

00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:14.170
The horizontal axis is time.

00:21:14.170 --> 00:21:16.740
The patent is here.

00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:19.550
Each of these boxes
is aligned in time,

00:21:19.550 --> 00:21:23.600
with the left edge being
the issue date and the tail

00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:25.490
being the filing date.

00:21:25.490 --> 00:21:27.650
And this is a single
patent landscape

00:21:27.650 --> 00:21:29.580
map when they started off.

00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:30.900
And these are the citations.

00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:34.450
So this patent cited all these
other patents as prior art

00:21:34.450 --> 00:21:38.250
in the course of
the examination.

00:21:38.250 --> 00:21:43.060
So by looking at these maps
you can see who's in the space

00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:44.960
and see what's going on.

00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:49.210
You can right click on the
system on any of the boxes

00:21:49.210 --> 00:21:51.700
and get the underlying
information.

00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:56.700
The statistics boxes on the
map shows you who's on the map

00:21:56.700 --> 00:21:59.390
so you can see quickly
who's in the space.

00:21:59.390 --> 00:22:03.081
And this is what this patent
looked like several years

00:22:03.081 --> 00:22:03.580
later.

00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:05.100
So when it issued,
of course nobody

00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:08.100
else was citing it because
these are not publicly

00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:11.760
disclosed back in this
day-- until it was issued.

00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:18.660
Over time, other things started
to cite Yonald's patent.

00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:21.630
So it's an example of
something where you can quickly

00:22:21.630 --> 00:22:23.315
look at it and check it out.

00:22:23.315 --> 00:22:25.680
And if you have any questions,
let me know on that.

00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:31.130
This is what the Virtual Ink
US portfolio looked like it

00:22:31.130 --> 00:22:32.950
when it had 12 patents.

00:22:32.950 --> 00:22:37.530
And you can see these
are some of patents.

00:22:37.530 --> 00:22:39.650
And you can start to see
other companies citing.

00:22:39.650 --> 00:22:43.180
So these are potential
partners, customers.

00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:45.210
It can also help you,
as you try to figure out

00:22:45.210 --> 00:22:46.860
as you look at a
space, where do you

00:22:46.860 --> 00:22:50.040
want to take the
commercialization plan.

00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:55.450
So check it out let me know
if you have any questions.

00:22:55.450 --> 00:23:00.000
OK, so the question
is when to file.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:01.150
Before you lose rights.

00:23:01.150 --> 00:23:06.630
So that's the whole thing about
if you do a public disclosure

00:23:06.630 --> 00:23:09.670
and you want to get a patent in
France or Germany or something,

00:23:09.670 --> 00:23:12.080
and you haven't filed
already somewhere,

00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:14.520
you're going to lose that.

00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:17.450
And then you want
to take into account

00:23:17.450 --> 00:23:21.840
we have new domain now called
the America Invents Act.

00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:26.350
Before, it used to be in the
US, that the first to invent won

00:23:26.350 --> 00:23:29.290
in a dispute between inventors.

00:23:29.290 --> 00:23:31.830
Under the new rules that
came into effect this year,

00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:33.490
it's the first to file.

00:23:33.490 --> 00:23:36.110
Which is actually a
tougher one for startups

00:23:36.110 --> 00:23:39.730
because you'd like to not
encounter all of that cost

00:23:39.730 --> 00:23:41.260
for filing until
you actually get

00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:43.600
an idea that it's a good idea.

00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:46.820
But you could lose the
race to the Patent Office.

00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:53.000
So it makes a little harder
on startups these days.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:56.080
A way to deal with the
high cost of filings

00:23:56.080 --> 00:24:00.710
are things called
Provisional Applications.

00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:03.160
Provisionals are
very simple things.

00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:04.660
They don't even
have to have claims.

00:24:04.660 --> 00:24:07.510
They just describe
what the invention is.

00:24:07.510 --> 00:24:13.100
And I've even seen people going
to give a paper at a talk slap

00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:14.940
a cover page on it and file it.

00:24:14.940 --> 00:24:16.650
And what it does
is it establishes

00:24:16.650 --> 00:24:19.730
a filing date, which means
for the rest of the world,

00:24:19.730 --> 00:24:21.060
you filed.

00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:22.900
And you now have one
year from the date

00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:24.280
you made the
provisional in order

00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:28.170
to decide whether you really
want a patent on the thing

00:24:28.170 --> 00:24:29.690
as you've tested out the market.

00:24:29.690 --> 00:24:32.040
These are pretty inexpensive.

00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:35.430
It's $130-- I checked the
other day-- for small entities.

00:24:35.430 --> 00:24:38.010
And for micro entities,
which all of you would be,

00:24:38.010 --> 00:24:40.230
it's $65 dollars.

00:24:40.230 --> 00:24:44.050
Nothing happens at the
PTO once it's filed.

00:24:44.050 --> 00:24:45.760
It's just a placeholder.

00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:50.530
And the only risk is that
if you disclose something

00:24:50.530 --> 00:24:56.100
in the provisional and when
you go to file the utility

00:24:56.100 --> 00:24:59.260
patent a year later,
you include things

00:24:59.260 --> 00:25:01.880
that weren't in the provisional,
you may have lost that.

00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:04.610
So you have to sort
of think that through.

00:25:04.610 --> 00:25:11.170
When we were developing the IP
Vision site as a SAS platform,

00:25:11.170 --> 00:25:14.170
we were doing revs
every four to six weeks.

00:25:14.170 --> 00:25:18.610
And for every release we'd
sit down and say, what is it

00:25:18.610 --> 00:25:22.920
we did that might be of interest
that we might want to patent.

00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:25.090
What did we think about
doing but we didn't actually

00:25:25.090 --> 00:25:28.720
do because it wasn't in
the development plan.

00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:32.740
We'd systematically do that and
we'd file provisional patents.

00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:34.070
$100 a pop.

00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:36.390
And it kept holding
our place until we

00:25:36.390 --> 00:25:39.440
were ready to figure out what
we really wanted to patent

00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:41.400
and spend the extra money on.

00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:42.274
Was there a question?

00:25:42.274 --> 00:25:43.222
AUDIENCE: Yeah, quick question.

00:25:43.222 --> 00:25:45.222
You said that they slapped
a coverage fee on it.

00:25:45.222 --> 00:25:47.962
[INAUDIBLE] That's then
publicly in the books.

00:25:47.962 --> 00:25:49.860
So does that mean--

00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:52.135
JOE HADZIMA: Oh sorry,
provisionals are not published.

00:25:52.135 --> 00:25:54.760
AUDIENCE: But weren't they going
to present it at a conference,

00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:55.740
you said?

00:25:55.740 --> 00:25:57.815
JOE HADZIMA: They
may go disclose it.

00:25:57.815 --> 00:26:00.106
AUDIENCE: Does that [INAUDIBLE]
an international patent

00:26:00.106 --> 00:26:00.606
platform?

00:26:00.606 --> 00:26:03.534
JOE HADZIMA: No, a provisional
counts as a filing.

00:26:03.534 --> 00:26:04.700
AUDIENCE: For international?

00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:07.450
JOE HADZIMA: For
international, yeah.

00:26:07.450 --> 00:26:09.230
That's the good part
of the invention.

00:26:09.230 --> 00:26:12.340
Now a patent lawyer will
say you're better off doing

00:26:12.340 --> 00:26:15.250
a whole application and get the
claims and think it through.

00:26:15.250 --> 00:26:18.090
Well, there's a lot of things
that would be good to do.

00:26:18.090 --> 00:26:20.060
It's just time and resources.

00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:26.640
So this is a reasonable
approach to think about.

00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:28.085
As I say, it's all
fact dependent.

00:26:28.085 --> 00:26:29.710
If you have something
that's really key

00:26:29.710 --> 00:26:32.420
and you really understand
exactly what the invention is,

00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:35.030
it might be worth going
directly to a full filing.

00:26:35.030 --> 00:26:37.682
But it's just a strategy.

00:26:37.682 --> 00:26:38.181
OK?

00:26:40.887 --> 00:26:41.840
So what's in a patent.

00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:43.350
How many people that
actually looked at a patent?

00:26:43.350 --> 00:26:44.310
Read one?

00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:47.030
Anyone have a patent?

00:26:47.030 --> 00:26:48.050
Couple.

00:26:48.050 --> 00:26:48.840
Good.

00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:53.470
So it's sort of like a
term paper in a sense.

00:26:53.470 --> 00:26:56.635
There's a part of it
that says, describe

00:26:56.635 --> 00:26:57.920
to me what the invention is.

00:26:57.920 --> 00:27:00.130
And again, it's a
societal trade off.

00:27:00.130 --> 00:27:02.700
You tell me your invention,
I'll give you this limited time

00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:03.660
monopoly.

00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:07.260
So part of the usual set up is
there's a field of invention,

00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:08.930
there's a background.

00:27:08.930 --> 00:27:12.850
You usually describe what's
broken that you fixed.

00:27:12.850 --> 00:27:15.780
To show why yours is novel
and nobody else has done it.

00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:17.090
Non-obvious.

00:27:17.090 --> 00:27:18.610
Then you summarize
the invention.

00:27:18.610 --> 00:27:21.380
Then you go into a
detailed description.

00:27:21.380 --> 00:27:23.040
And there's this
technical thing saying

00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:26.170
you have to really explain what
the best mode of practicing

00:27:26.170 --> 00:27:27.380
your invention is.

00:27:27.380 --> 00:27:30.800
Because again, the idea
is if that knowledge gets

00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:33.200
in a society, everybody
can build off of it

00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:35.360
and we all get better.

00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:38.890
And we give you the rights to
exclude for the 20 year period.

00:27:38.890 --> 00:27:41.960
So you've got to really
actually describe how it works.

00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:44.740
And then the claims
are the key part.

00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:48.450
Now from a cost viewpoint,
I think everyone in the room

00:27:48.450 --> 00:27:53.210
is capable of writing
everything about the patent

00:27:53.210 --> 00:27:55.930
and save a bunch of money,
at least as a first draft.

00:27:55.930 --> 00:27:57.400
You want the patent lawyers.

00:27:57.400 --> 00:28:00.450
So the people that know
how to craft the claims.

00:28:00.450 --> 00:28:02.250
The claims are the tricky part.

00:28:02.250 --> 00:28:04.330
If you ever have to
enforce this stuff,

00:28:04.330 --> 00:28:06.660
it's the claims
that really matter.

00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:09.030
So that's where you want to
spend the legal money-- is

00:28:09.030 --> 00:28:10.430
on the claims.

00:28:10.430 --> 00:28:12.560
And if you just go in and
drop your lab notebook

00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:14.850
on the patent
lawyer's desk, you're

00:28:14.850 --> 00:28:17.270
paying by the hour for
stuff that you probably

00:28:17.270 --> 00:28:18.907
are better off doing
yourself and doing

00:28:18.907 --> 00:28:20.990
the first draft of what
it is you're trying to do.

00:28:23.010 --> 00:28:27.660
Cost of-- US, an application
is about anywhere from $5,000

00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:30.300
to $15,000 on average.

00:28:30.300 --> 00:28:33.330
I've actually ended up
spending $30,000 because I

00:28:33.330 --> 00:28:35.470
didn't control the process.

00:28:35.470 --> 00:28:38.690
One of my co-founders kept
calling the patent lawyer

00:28:38.690 --> 00:28:41.260
and throwing new things
in without telling me.

00:28:41.260 --> 00:28:43.000
And then I get the bill.

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:46.240
I thought I had
the control on it.

00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:49.780
The filing fee is not that much.

00:28:49.780 --> 00:28:52.910
I should mention that
applications in the US

00:28:52.910 --> 00:28:56.970
are now published 18
months after they're filed.

00:28:56.970 --> 00:28:59.590
That is the official
utility application, not

00:28:59.590 --> 00:29:00.850
the provisional.

00:29:00.850 --> 00:29:04.550
So when you actually file your
full application, 18 months,

00:29:04.550 --> 00:29:05.320
they're published.

00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:08.040
And the only exception
is if you say,

00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:11.680
I don't want to get a patent
any place else in the world,

00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:15.630
then they will publish it in
the US until it actually issues,

00:29:15.630 --> 00:29:17.520
if and when it issues.

00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:21.000
Foreign applications
are really expensive.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.910
There was a government
accounting office study

00:29:23.910 --> 00:29:26.830
in the early 2000
era that looked

00:29:26.830 --> 00:29:32.060
at 10 countries and an invention
by a relatively small entity.

00:29:32.060 --> 00:29:34.565
And they estimated it would
cost somewhere between $300,000

00:29:34.565 --> 00:29:38.650
and $500,000 to file
and maintain a patent

00:29:38.650 --> 00:29:41.030
and in the 10 major countries.

00:29:41.030 --> 00:29:45.890
So you want to be a little bit
thoughtful about this stuff.

00:29:45.890 --> 00:29:50.320
Now I'm going to switch over
to university licensing.

00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:53.090
And a little bit of history.

00:29:53.090 --> 00:29:55.960
The federal government
sponsors a lot of research

00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:57.800
all over the country.

00:29:57.800 --> 00:30:00.530
And it used to be
the ownership of that

00:30:00.530 --> 00:30:03.210
was the federal government and
somebody in Washington trying

00:30:03.210 --> 00:30:05.280
to figure out what
was happening.

00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:09.550
The Bayh-Dole Act came around
in 1980 and it said, look,

00:30:09.550 --> 00:30:11.930
we're going to put licensing
down at the university level

00:30:11.930 --> 00:30:14.270
where the research is done
because they'll have a better

00:30:14.270 --> 00:30:16.170
idea of what's going on.

00:30:16.170 --> 00:30:17.880
And we're going to
give them some rights

00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:18.755
and some obligations.

00:30:21.730 --> 00:30:25.030
So the key point here-- you can
look at it on the slide later--

00:30:25.030 --> 00:30:28.700
is really putting it at
the university level.

00:30:28.700 --> 00:30:33.480
There is some emphasis in
the rules about licensing

00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:35.485
to small companies.

00:30:35.485 --> 00:30:38.500
It used to be the big companies,
now the small companies.

00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:42.750
And there's a provision for
royalties to inventors out

00:30:42.750 --> 00:30:44.550
of the process.

00:30:44.550 --> 00:30:47.310
Now at MIT it's the
Technology Licensing Office,

00:30:47.310 --> 00:30:48.900
known as the TLO.

00:30:48.900 --> 00:30:52.200
That is the place
that administers this.

00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:56.570
Now the primary goal stated
by the TLO is tech transfer.

00:30:56.570 --> 00:30:59.690
They want to get inventions
out into the marketplace.

00:30:59.690 --> 00:31:04.500
And the secondary goal
is to generate revenue.

00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:07.590
And there's the website
for checking it out.

00:31:07.590 --> 00:31:09.940
Now, the secondary goal--
a lot of universities

00:31:09.940 --> 00:31:12.630
seem to put the emphasis more
on the revenue side and less

00:31:12.630 --> 00:31:14.130
on the tech transfer.

00:31:14.130 --> 00:31:15.565
So MIT is a little
unique in this.

00:31:18.030 --> 00:31:19.950
There's a question
of who owns stuff.

00:31:19.950 --> 00:31:22.660
There's MIT IP Ownership Policy.

00:31:22.660 --> 00:31:24.920
You can check us out at the TLO.

00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:27.240
And essentially,
it says, look, MIT

00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:30.450
is going to own the
work that's done here

00:31:30.450 --> 00:31:37.550
by staff and researchers if
it's under funded research.

00:31:37.550 --> 00:31:41.090
It will also own it if there's
a significant use of MIT

00:31:41.090 --> 00:31:42.630
resources-- facilities.

00:31:42.630 --> 00:31:45.850
So if you're using
the nuclear reactor.

00:31:45.850 --> 00:31:47.390
It doesn't mean
that you're using

00:31:47.390 --> 00:31:50.060
Athena or stuff like that.

00:31:50.060 --> 00:31:51.600
But if you're using
significant use,

00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:53.565
then MIT may claim ownership.

00:31:56.100 --> 00:31:58.420
If you have questions
about ownership,

00:31:58.420 --> 00:32:01.200
the TLO is pretty approachable.

00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:04.010
So you can go over and
chat with them about it.

00:32:04.010 --> 00:32:07.960
And they often will
waive or clarify rights

00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:12.380
to enable you to
start your company.

00:32:12.380 --> 00:32:16.205
What you don't want to
do is go down the path,

00:32:16.205 --> 00:32:18.080
get investors interested,
and then have them,

00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:21.180
again, find out that
maybe you don't actually

00:32:21.180 --> 00:32:22.310
have rights to the stuff.

00:32:22.310 --> 00:32:24.650
That's not a good place to be.

00:32:27.860 --> 00:32:32.300
Now this place has got a
lot of smart people doing

00:32:32.300 --> 00:32:34.080
a lot of interesting things.

00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:37.430
And not all of it falls
under the sponsored research

00:32:37.430 --> 00:32:40.820
or significant
use of facilities.

00:32:40.820 --> 00:32:42.830
So MIT actually
has a policy that

00:32:42.830 --> 00:32:45.770
says we will voluntarily
look at and maybe

00:32:45.770 --> 00:32:48.440
take on board inventions
the people have.

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:52.740
Even if it wasn't
under funded research.

00:32:52.740 --> 00:32:56.890
And what they'll do is so
prosecute the patent around

00:32:56.890 --> 00:32:58.990
and engage in licensing.

00:32:58.990 --> 00:33:04.530
So that's opened up the number
of things that the TLO does.

00:33:04.530 --> 00:33:06.420
And they're pretty
open about it.

00:33:06.420 --> 00:33:09.150
Now as a startup,
what can you do.

00:33:09.150 --> 00:33:11.990
Licensing can be expensive.

00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:13.870
You're trying to
put a plan together,

00:33:13.870 --> 00:33:15.780
you're trying to
figure out your market,

00:33:15.780 --> 00:33:19.230
you want to secure the
rights, and you need funding.

00:33:19.230 --> 00:33:21.430
So typically what
happens is you'll get

00:33:21.430 --> 00:33:26.130
an option on the technology.

00:33:26.130 --> 00:33:28.260
We'll call it just
technology broadly.

00:33:28.260 --> 00:33:30.050
It's usually six
months to a year.

00:33:30.050 --> 00:33:33.450
It's not that expensive.

00:33:33.450 --> 00:33:37.590
You'll have to assume some of
the patent prosecution costs.

00:33:37.590 --> 00:33:39.580
And what it allows
you to do-- that is,

00:33:39.580 --> 00:33:41.830
to know-- that when
you take the idea out

00:33:41.830 --> 00:33:45.559
to the investor community,
you actually can fulfill.

00:33:45.559 --> 00:33:46.850
You've got everything lined up.

00:33:46.850 --> 00:33:48.740
I've got rights to the patents.

00:33:48.740 --> 00:33:52.170
I've got my idea, I've got my
team, I just need your money.

00:33:52.170 --> 00:33:55.220
And away you go.

00:33:55.220 --> 00:33:57.580
Typical license terms.

00:33:57.580 --> 00:34:02.280
This is a couple years
old, care of Steve Brown,

00:34:02.280 --> 00:34:05.170
who used to be at the TLO.

00:34:05.170 --> 00:34:08.489
The components of the license
you'll find include issue fees.

00:34:08.489 --> 00:34:10.530
In other words, what does
it cost to actually get

00:34:10.530 --> 00:34:12.400
the license directly.

00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:14.520
There's maintenance
fees to continue

00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:17.290
to maintain the license.

00:34:17.290 --> 00:34:18.230
There's diligence.

00:34:18.230 --> 00:34:22.540
They don't want you
to just sit on it.

00:34:22.540 --> 00:34:24.870
And what I've done
in the columns here

00:34:24.870 --> 00:34:27.880
is if you don't want
to give up equity,

00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:32.380
what the typical terms are, and
what the terms are with equity.

00:34:32.380 --> 00:34:34.620
Royalty as a percentage of sale.

00:34:34.620 --> 00:34:37.590
You see 3% to 5% with no equity.

00:34:37.590 --> 00:34:40.360
2% to 4%, maybe with.

00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:43.739
Patent costs are
the same, et cetera.

00:34:43.739 --> 00:34:48.679
Now from equity side, one
of the big innovations

00:34:48.679 --> 00:34:51.469
that MIT did is-- it used
to be only big companies

00:34:51.469 --> 00:34:53.949
would come in and license.

00:34:53.949 --> 00:34:57.359
But we look here and all the
entrepreneurial stuff going on.

00:34:57.359 --> 00:34:59.150
They said, well we want
to figure out a way

00:34:59.150 --> 00:35:00.950
to encourage small companies.

00:35:00.950 --> 00:35:02.140
And so how do we do that.

00:35:02.140 --> 00:35:05.080
Well the equity was
one way to do it.

00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:08.760
And we'll take equity in
lieu of the cash fees.

00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:11.770
Typically it's single
digit percentage of equity

00:35:11.770 --> 00:35:14.340
that you give up.

00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:17.600
And that percentage is
maintained undiluted, usually

00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:21.084
through the first major
round of financing.

00:35:21.084 --> 00:35:22.500
And we'll talk
about what dilution

00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:25.500
means when we get into
terms here in a little bit.

00:35:25.500 --> 00:35:27.600
These were typical
royalties a few years ago

00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:28.780
for university patents.

00:35:28.780 --> 00:35:31.232
You'll see they're
all over the place.

00:35:31.232 --> 00:35:32.440
Again, it's in the materials.

00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:36.460
You can check those out.

00:35:36.460 --> 00:35:38.670
Now how do they have
split things up.

00:35:38.670 --> 00:35:41.600
Just so you have
an appreciation.

00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:43.710
If there is any
return from a license,

00:35:43.710 --> 00:35:46.420
be it royalties or a
company goes public

00:35:46.420 --> 00:35:49.740
and MIT sells the
stock, 15% percent

00:35:49.740 --> 00:35:53.580
comes off the top to pay
for TLO operating expenses.

00:35:53.580 --> 00:35:56.330
Than they deduct
the patent costs.

00:35:56.330 --> 00:36:00.380
And then after that, a third
of it goes to the inventors.

00:36:00.380 --> 00:36:02.450
And then basically, with
some other adjustments,

00:36:02.450 --> 00:36:08.870
the other two thirds are split
between the department and MIT

00:36:08.870 --> 00:36:11.530
in general.

00:36:11.530 --> 00:36:14.370
So that's a
university licensing.

00:36:14.370 --> 00:36:20.110
Any questions on that?

00:36:20.110 --> 00:36:21.960
OK, really do approach the TLO.

00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:23.710
They're pretty responsive.

00:36:23.710 --> 00:36:25.366
Or they can be.

00:36:25.366 --> 00:36:26.992
AUDIENCE: Can you
kind of name some

00:36:26.992 --> 00:36:29.758
of the pitfalls of some
[INAUDIBLE] something

00:36:29.758 --> 00:36:33.174
out of the lab, and
not necessarily-- like

00:36:33.174 --> 00:36:38.542
when to sever ties
with the research lab

00:36:38.542 --> 00:36:41.144
and make sure you have
a really strong wall

00:36:41.144 --> 00:36:42.977
between the two and [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:42.977 --> 00:36:45.060
JOE HADZIMA: Yeah there's
a whole bunch of things.

00:36:45.060 --> 00:36:52.370
So the basic strategy is
that if you're funded,

00:36:52.370 --> 00:36:55.610
you get your license, and
you set up shop outside,

00:36:55.610 --> 00:36:59.970
and the people that are at
MIT go across the street

00:36:59.970 --> 00:37:01.980
and do their work in
the lab or whatever.

00:37:01.980 --> 00:37:06.740
Across the street,
not on MIT campus.

00:37:06.740 --> 00:37:08.510
And that sort of
works the same way

00:37:08.510 --> 00:37:10.210
if you're starting a company.

00:37:10.210 --> 00:37:11.810
That you try to
separate the two.

00:37:11.810 --> 00:37:14.740
Now it gets a little complex if
you're under sponsored research

00:37:14.740 --> 00:37:16.130
and you're being
funded in a lab.

00:37:16.130 --> 00:37:18.050
It can get a little complex.

00:37:18.050 --> 00:37:21.230
We had a situation a few years
ago back when I was practicing.

00:37:21.230 --> 00:37:23.260
Where my client was a
professor in the AI,

00:37:23.260 --> 00:37:28.420
artificial intelligence group,
and one of his PhD students

00:37:28.420 --> 00:37:32.560
was split between the
Media Lab and the AI group.

00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:35.400
And because of the way the
Media Lab stuff worked,

00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:38.520
the professors
inventions were somehow

00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:40.390
being claimed by the Media Lab.

00:37:40.390 --> 00:37:42.230
So there's some real
technical stuff there.

00:37:42.230 --> 00:37:45.130
But there are plenty of people
who can help you out on that.

00:37:45.130 --> 00:37:47.010
And I just want to
put a red flag up.

00:37:47.010 --> 00:37:48.250
Again, to think about it.

00:37:48.250 --> 00:37:50.570
In terms of whether you
can actually own it,

00:37:50.570 --> 00:37:54.610
the TLO can be
approachable on that.

00:37:54.610 --> 00:37:57.840
OK, now I want to switch
to the next topic, which is

00:37:57.840 --> 00:38:00.949
legal forms of doing business.

00:38:00.949 --> 00:38:01.990
How do you get organized.

00:38:01.990 --> 00:38:04.559
And again, these are sort of
the red flag kind of things.

00:38:04.559 --> 00:38:05.600
I'm going to cut through.

00:38:05.600 --> 00:38:08.650
I do a whole couple of sessions
at Sloan on this stuff.

00:38:08.650 --> 00:38:11.290
But here I'm going to try
to give you the high level

00:38:11.290 --> 00:38:13.580
conclusions.

00:38:13.580 --> 00:38:16.700
So in most cases
for companies that

00:38:16.700 --> 00:38:18.670
are technology
based companies that

00:38:18.670 --> 00:38:22.120
are going to need any
kind of financing,

00:38:22.120 --> 00:38:26.340
the choice is a
Delaware corporation.

00:38:26.340 --> 00:38:29.060
Delaware has a
corporate law that's

00:38:29.060 --> 00:38:35.740
very flexible,
predictable, and it

00:38:35.740 --> 00:38:40.150
has its separate court that
hears specific cases surround

00:38:40.150 --> 00:38:42.310
stockholder rights.

00:38:42.310 --> 00:38:46.380
And so the default tends
to be towards Delaware.

00:38:46.380 --> 00:38:51.190
And the question is, when
should you incorporate.

00:38:51.190 --> 00:38:52.550
Or should you incorporate.

00:38:52.550 --> 00:38:55.520
Basically, the corporation
gives you limited liability

00:38:55.520 --> 00:38:59.510
as owners of the business.

00:39:02.250 --> 00:39:05.542
You can't say, look,
I've got this idea.

00:39:05.542 --> 00:39:07.000
I'm going to set
up a company, I'll

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:08.950
transfer my invention
to the company,

00:39:08.950 --> 00:39:11.460
and I won't have any
personal liability.

00:39:11.460 --> 00:39:14.610
You're always liable
for your own acts.

00:39:14.610 --> 00:39:18.410
The question here, from
launching a company viewpoint,

00:39:18.410 --> 00:39:21.530
is are your investors going
to be liable for your acts.

00:39:21.530 --> 00:39:26.270
So that's where corporate form
protects the shareholders.

00:39:26.270 --> 00:39:30.120
Now the question is
when to incorporate.

00:39:30.120 --> 00:39:32.560
You should do it
sooner than later

00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:38.890
to avoid personal liability
based on your ownership

00:39:38.890 --> 00:39:41.430
and toward
partnership liability.

00:39:41.430 --> 00:39:45.480
And there's a thing I'm going to
go into called the Section 83.

00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:50.040
And that's a real catch for
you if you don't work on it

00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:53.330
and incorporate early.

00:39:53.330 --> 00:39:55.540
Now the next question
is, all right,

00:39:55.540 --> 00:39:58.270
I got a corporate
form, how is it taxed.

00:39:58.270 --> 00:40:01.030
And again, the default
that I always recommend

00:40:01.030 --> 00:40:05.540
is to file what's called
an S corporation election.

00:40:05.540 --> 00:40:09.830
So a regular corporation
is taxed on its profit.

00:40:09.830 --> 00:40:12.300
And when that profit is handed
out to the shareholders,

00:40:12.300 --> 00:40:13.100
it's taxed again.

00:40:13.100 --> 00:40:14.920
So there's two layers of tax.

00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:18.810
A Subchapter S, if you qualify--
there's only one layer of tax.

00:40:18.810 --> 00:40:20.260
The corporation doesn't pay tax.

00:40:23.230 --> 00:40:26.980
But the attributes get passed
through to the shareholders.

00:40:26.980 --> 00:40:28.880
You have to have fewer
than 100 shareholders.

00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:31.970
One class of stock.

00:40:31.970 --> 00:40:34.857
And you can't have
nonresident aliens

00:40:34.857 --> 00:40:36.690
as shareholders, which
is an issue if you're

00:40:36.690 --> 00:40:40.430
a foreign student.

00:40:40.430 --> 00:40:44.640
And it has to be
primarily human beings,

00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:46.570
except for certain
types of trusts.

00:40:46.570 --> 00:40:48.620
So as soon as a
venture capital firm--

00:40:48.620 --> 00:40:53.370
if you take the money-- invests,
it'll destroy the Subchapter S

00:40:53.370 --> 00:40:55.560
status and it'll
be taxed as a C.

00:40:55.560 --> 00:40:58.350
But it can really
make a difference.

00:40:58.350 --> 00:41:01.500
The first company that was
taken out of the Media Lab

00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:05.940
was a company called DIVA,
Digital Video Applications.

00:41:05.940 --> 00:41:08.580
And the founder said, if we
don't ever get venture money,

00:41:08.580 --> 00:41:10.200
we'll never succeed.

00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:13.380
And I said, well let's do
it with the S corporation.

00:41:13.380 --> 00:41:15.460
Well they never did
raise venture money.

00:41:15.460 --> 00:41:17.491
They sold the company
two years later

00:41:17.491 --> 00:41:19.490
for I think it was somewhere
around $10 million.

00:41:19.490 --> 00:41:25.796
And they saved a million and a
half or more having done that.

00:41:25.796 --> 00:41:28.750
Let me move through here.

00:41:28.750 --> 00:41:31.260
Here's an example of the
S corporation taxation.

00:41:31.260 --> 00:41:33.010
I'll just leave it in there.

00:41:33.010 --> 00:41:34.680
You can see the
two layers of tax.

00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:37.690
And the net effect is,
well why would you do this

00:41:37.690 --> 00:41:39.280
if most startups lose money.

00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:40.590
They're not going to be taxed.

00:41:40.590 --> 00:41:42.340
And the issue is
it's when it gets

00:41:42.340 --> 00:41:45.220
acquired that you can succeed.

00:41:45.220 --> 00:41:49.390
And you can save 20 plus
percent under current rates.

00:41:49.390 --> 00:41:53.440
You can work the math from
the slides that are online.

00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:57.070
Now I want to switch to
something that is actually

00:41:57.070 --> 00:41:59.520
an issue for you personally.

00:41:59.520 --> 00:42:00.800
And it can be a big thing.

00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:03.560
It's a very odd part
of the Internal Revenue

00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:05.970
code called Section 83.

00:42:05.970 --> 00:42:09.380
And it says, if you receive
property in connection

00:42:09.380 --> 00:42:12.995
with providing
services- and here stock

00:42:12.995 --> 00:42:17.620
is property for this purpose--
then you have ordinary income.

00:42:17.620 --> 00:42:21.260
That's like you get when
you get a paycheck, which

00:42:21.260 --> 00:42:26.090
can be taxed up to 35 plus
percent under current rates.

00:42:26.090 --> 00:42:28.530
And the amount is the fair
market value of the property

00:42:28.530 --> 00:42:32.660
that you get, minus
what you paid.

00:42:32.660 --> 00:42:35.860
And that's what the income
is that you pay tax on.

00:42:35.860 --> 00:42:37.410
So here's an example.

00:42:37.410 --> 00:42:38.247
I like your idea.

00:42:38.247 --> 00:42:40.080
And I say, I'll tell
you what, I'll give you

00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:45.440
a million dollars, we'll start
a company, and how about 50-50.

00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:47.050
And you say, OK.

00:42:47.050 --> 00:42:49.910
For this purpose, you say 50-50.

00:42:49.910 --> 00:42:53.350
What happens is, let
me ask you how much

00:42:53.350 --> 00:42:54.970
is your 50% of the company.

00:42:54.970 --> 00:42:57.740
I provide the capital,
a million dollars,

00:42:57.740 --> 00:43:02.100
we each have 50% of the company,
and you get the other 50%,

00:43:02.100 --> 00:43:05.810
how much is your side worth.

00:43:05.810 --> 00:43:06.630
Anybody?

00:43:06.630 --> 00:43:09.047
AUDIENCE: What's the [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:09.047 --> 00:43:10.880
JOE HADZIMA: I put the
first million dollars

00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:12.481
in for half the company.

00:43:12.481 --> 00:43:14.390
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:14.390 --> 00:43:16.304
JOE HADZIMA: Yeah, it
could be a million or--

00:43:16.304 --> 00:43:18.280
AUDIENCE: $750,000.

00:43:18.280 --> 00:43:20.114
JOE HADZIMA: $750,000.

00:43:20.114 --> 00:43:21.530
Well you could say
it's a million,

00:43:21.530 --> 00:43:24.100
because why would I pay
a million for one half

00:43:24.100 --> 00:43:25.970
if the other half
wasn't worth a million.

00:43:25.970 --> 00:43:28.650
On the other hand, once the
million dollars goes in,

00:43:28.650 --> 00:43:32.310
and there's no real asset in
there other than the million

00:43:32.310 --> 00:43:34.800
dollars, you sort of own
half the million dollars.

00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:36.320
So let's just do the math.

00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:41.180
So the fair market value, if it
was at $500,000, you pay zero,

00:43:41.180 --> 00:43:44.900
your ordinary income
is $500,000 taxed

00:43:44.900 --> 00:43:49.390
at 35% percent or something.

00:43:49.390 --> 00:43:49.970
Not good.

00:43:49.970 --> 00:43:54.150
And if it's a million, 40%
would be $200,000 you owe.

00:43:54.150 --> 00:43:57.820
And if it's a million,
you owe $400,000.

00:43:57.820 --> 00:43:59.400
Congratulations.

00:43:59.400 --> 00:44:00.840
Tax bill.

00:44:00.840 --> 00:44:03.610
So that's not a
good result, right?

00:44:03.610 --> 00:44:05.820
So the question is,
how do you avoid that.

00:44:05.820 --> 00:44:09.030
Well the trick is
to separate the time

00:44:09.030 --> 00:44:13.180
when you get your stock from the
time the investment comes in.

00:44:13.180 --> 00:44:16.190
So if you come in to a
lawyer's office on Friday

00:44:16.190 --> 00:44:19.460
with a term sheet and
say, let's incorporate,

00:44:19.460 --> 00:44:21.500
we're going to close
next week, the question

00:44:21.500 --> 00:44:25.110
is, what happened between
Friday and when you closed.

00:44:25.110 --> 00:44:26.672
Well maybe a patent
issued or you

00:44:26.672 --> 00:44:28.570
got FDA approval or something.

00:44:28.570 --> 00:44:34.400
So you stretch those
further in time

00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:36.060
and you get your
stock early then

00:44:36.060 --> 00:44:37.905
you don't fall into this trap.

00:44:37.905 --> 00:44:39.780
It's when you get your
stock at the same time

00:44:39.780 --> 00:44:41.400
the investment comes in.

00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:46.370
So the mission here is to
incorporate earlier and issue

00:44:46.370 --> 00:44:50.410
stock as soon as you
can and make what's

00:44:50.410 --> 00:44:55.500
called an 83(b) election, which
we won't go into fully here,

00:44:55.500 --> 00:44:58.080
but you have to do
that within 30 days.

00:44:58.080 --> 00:45:02.650
So the question is, why doesn't
stock get issued in time.

00:45:02.650 --> 00:45:03.710
Even with startups.

00:45:03.710 --> 00:45:08.120
I see so many situations
where the team is working,

00:45:08.120 --> 00:45:10.650
they're doing all the things
that guys up here talked about.

00:45:10.650 --> 00:45:13.255
And the investment comes
in and they may even

00:45:13.255 --> 00:45:16.330
have incorporated, but
they haven't actually

00:45:16.330 --> 00:45:18.450
given the stock out.

00:45:18.450 --> 00:45:24.859
And I think it could be anything
from too busy to nobody's quite

00:45:24.859 --> 00:45:25.900
sure who should get what.

00:45:25.900 --> 00:45:27.630
You heard John
talk about everyone

00:45:27.630 --> 00:45:29.255
pulling their weight
except one person.

00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:34.750
What I do see in the case
of technical startups

00:45:34.750 --> 00:45:38.590
is the issue between
the technologists

00:45:38.590 --> 00:45:42.180
who maybe has the idea--
so think of the dynamics.

00:45:42.180 --> 00:45:44.060
We're starting a company.

00:45:44.060 --> 00:45:46.780
We've got to sort of prove out
the technology with a prototype

00:45:46.780 --> 00:45:47.930
or something.

00:45:47.930 --> 00:45:50.500
And the technologist
is working in the lab.

00:45:50.500 --> 00:45:53.270
Working really hard
on it, long hours.

00:45:53.270 --> 00:45:55.860
And the business side people
are waiting, maybe even

00:45:55.860 --> 00:45:59.222
keep their day job
doing the planning.

00:45:59.222 --> 00:46:00.680
And there's sort
of this dichotomy.

00:46:00.680 --> 00:46:03.280
So if you think
about it this way.

00:46:03.280 --> 00:46:07.900
If you say I have time
across a horizontal axis

00:46:07.900 --> 00:46:10.710
and relative importance.

00:46:10.710 --> 00:46:15.130
And I said, where would you
put the technology person

00:46:15.130 --> 00:46:20.110
on this chart at the beginning.

00:46:20.110 --> 00:46:22.170
How relatively important
is the technology

00:46:22.170 --> 00:46:24.660
in a start up at the beginning.

00:46:24.660 --> 00:46:26.910
Well it's going to be high,
because if it doesn't work

00:46:26.910 --> 00:46:28.300
you don't have anything.

00:46:28.300 --> 00:46:31.094
And where would you
put the business guy.

00:46:31.094 --> 00:46:32.845
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:32.845 --> 00:46:34.470
JOE HADZIMA: Well
over time, technology

00:46:34.470 --> 00:46:35.900
is less important, right?

00:46:35.900 --> 00:46:37.540
Relatively speaking.

00:46:37.540 --> 00:46:41.210
And the business starts at the
bottom, relatively speaking,

00:46:41.210 --> 00:46:42.390
and improves over time.

00:46:42.390 --> 00:46:44.430
And at some point,
they're balanced off.

00:46:44.430 --> 00:46:47.000
Whether they cross or not
isn't really important.

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:48.830
The important
thing is to realize

00:46:48.830 --> 00:46:52.062
you can have team dynamics
where the technology people, who

00:46:52.062 --> 00:46:53.520
think it's their
invention, they're

00:46:53.520 --> 00:46:56.020
doing all the
work-- and then how

00:46:56.020 --> 00:47:00.000
do you end up splitting stock
in a situation like that.

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:02.660
Well it's my technology,
I don't want to give it.

00:47:02.660 --> 00:47:04.390
You guys aren't really doing it.

00:47:04.390 --> 00:47:07.070
And you get a lot of
tension around that.

00:47:07.070 --> 00:47:09.040
But just simply
realizing the dynamics

00:47:09.040 --> 00:47:11.134
of relative importance.

00:47:11.134 --> 00:47:12.550
And you heard from
the people here

00:47:12.550 --> 00:47:14.190
about needing a
whole team to pull

00:47:14.190 --> 00:47:18.580
it off can at least put people
in the same way of thinking

00:47:18.580 --> 00:47:19.620
about it.

00:47:19.620 --> 00:47:21.620
Does that make sense?

00:47:21.620 --> 00:47:24.350
OK.

00:47:24.350 --> 00:47:27.050
Now what you heard from
the have the team here

00:47:27.050 --> 00:47:28.880
tonight that people
was the most important.

00:47:28.880 --> 00:47:31.040
And most companies fail
because of people issues.

00:47:31.040 --> 00:47:35.770
So you got to sort out
those relationships upfront.

00:47:35.770 --> 00:47:41.120
Now in a small company,
the stockholders

00:47:41.120 --> 00:47:42.730
owe each other a fiduciary duty.

00:47:42.730 --> 00:47:44.910
Meaning you got a
sort of treat everyone

00:47:44.910 --> 00:47:46.836
with a degree of fairness.

00:47:46.836 --> 00:47:48.210
So you'll have a
set of questions

00:47:48.210 --> 00:47:49.520
about who sits on the board.

00:47:49.520 --> 00:47:54.640
If you populate a board other
than for legal, who owes what

00:47:54.640 --> 00:47:58.020
titles, what functional things.

00:47:58.020 --> 00:47:59.720
You want to talk
about restrictions

00:47:59.720 --> 00:48:02.180
on stock transfers.

00:48:02.180 --> 00:48:04.380
Rights of first refusal,
tag along rights,

00:48:04.380 --> 00:48:07.190
all of these terms
here you can read

00:48:07.190 --> 00:48:10.310
about in the founders memo,
which is in the resources

00:48:10.310 --> 00:48:13.400
part of the website.

00:48:13.400 --> 00:48:16.980
This is a memo that years
ago-- I had one week,

00:48:16.980 --> 00:48:23.230
as a relatively young lawyer,
and I had three teams come in.

00:48:23.230 --> 00:48:25.460
Great startup teams from MIT.

00:48:25.460 --> 00:48:27.797
And with each team I
spent four to five hours

00:48:27.797 --> 00:48:30.130
with them trying to walk them
through the kind of things

00:48:30.130 --> 00:48:31.392
that you need to think about.

00:48:31.392 --> 00:48:33.850
So at the end of the week I'm
thinking, this is ridiculous.

00:48:33.850 --> 00:48:37.200
I went through the same set of
exercises with these people.

00:48:37.200 --> 00:48:39.447
They don't want to
pay me to do this.

00:48:39.447 --> 00:48:41.530
I don't want to spend all
the time educating them.

00:48:41.530 --> 00:48:44.161
So I went home and I wrote
the beginning or the Founder's

00:48:44.161 --> 00:48:46.410
Memo, which sort of sets out
all of the kind of things

00:48:46.410 --> 00:48:47.272
to think about.

00:48:47.272 --> 00:48:49.230
And what I would do after
that is, I would say,

00:48:49.230 --> 00:48:52.144
if you're going to come
in and meet with me,

00:48:52.144 --> 00:48:53.810
I want you all to
read the founders memo

00:48:53.810 --> 00:48:58.540
and start talking about
what philosophy you have

00:48:58.540 --> 00:49:00.440
and understand
some of the issues.

00:49:00.440 --> 00:49:03.640
So we don't spend a lot
of time educating you

00:49:03.640 --> 00:49:05.210
while the meter's running.

00:49:05.210 --> 00:49:06.620
And that worked
very effectively.

00:49:06.620 --> 00:49:09.130
So the Founder's Memo--
it's not a fancy memo

00:49:09.130 --> 00:49:11.299
but it's been very helpful
to people over the years

00:49:11.299 --> 00:49:11.840
they tell me.

00:49:15.200 --> 00:49:18.060
So the question is how to
founder's equity split.

00:49:18.060 --> 00:49:24.040
The Wasserman book is a good one
to look out on different ways

00:49:24.040 --> 00:49:26.720
founders think about splitting.

00:49:26.720 --> 00:49:28.540
There's no one formula.

00:49:28.540 --> 00:49:29.910
There's a culture.

00:49:29.910 --> 00:49:32.640
I negotiated Kenan Systems.

00:49:32.640 --> 00:49:37.780
It was a very successful company
sold for a billion dollars.

00:49:37.780 --> 00:49:41.250
It was owned by one
person, Kenan Sahin.

00:49:41.250 --> 00:49:45.100
He paid all of his
people good salaries.

00:49:45.100 --> 00:49:46.580
And that culture worked.

00:49:46.580 --> 00:49:48.780
It was a very
successful company.

00:49:48.780 --> 00:49:53.180
He ended up giving $100
million to MIT, which was nice.

00:49:53.180 --> 00:49:54.880
But it doesn't mean
that you always

00:49:54.880 --> 00:49:56.120
have to spread equity around.

00:49:59.600 --> 00:50:01.590
And part of this is
from Charlie's slides.

00:50:01.590 --> 00:50:04.130
You're going to look at the
value of past contributions

00:50:04.130 --> 00:50:06.580
and future contributions.

00:50:06.580 --> 00:50:08.050
Sacrifice commitment.

00:50:08.050 --> 00:50:11.360
Ownership of IP.

00:50:11.360 --> 00:50:15.490
People's internal or
external market value.

00:50:15.490 --> 00:50:16.980
And internal equity.

00:50:16.980 --> 00:50:20.820
There was a good
team that was set up

00:50:20.820 --> 00:50:23.680
that went through a really
disciplined exercise

00:50:23.680 --> 00:50:27.430
where there was at MIT
professor and a post-doc.

00:50:27.430 --> 00:50:29.760
And they were trying to
figure out how to split it up.

00:50:29.760 --> 00:50:31.740
So I said to each
of them, well you

00:50:31.740 --> 00:50:37.220
write down what you think you're
giving up to join the company.

00:50:37.220 --> 00:50:38.950
And we just have a
discussion about it.

00:50:38.950 --> 00:50:40.420
So the professor
said, well, I've

00:50:40.420 --> 00:50:42.430
got a worldwide reputation.

00:50:42.430 --> 00:50:44.270
I'm allowed to consult
one day a week.

00:50:44.270 --> 00:50:47.000
If I joined the company, I'm
not going to be doing that.

00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:49.430
My consulting rate is x.

00:50:49.430 --> 00:50:51.750
And he had a bunch of things.

00:50:51.750 --> 00:50:55.300
The post-doc said, well, I'll
be giving up my academic career.

00:50:55.300 --> 00:50:57.870
It would be very hard
for me to go back.

00:50:57.870 --> 00:51:00.900
If I got a job in industry,
I'd be making this much.

00:51:00.900 --> 00:51:04.669
I'm going to be spending
full time on this.

00:51:04.669 --> 00:51:06.210
And it created a
framework where they

00:51:06.210 --> 00:51:10.240
could have a discussion around
how they were approaching it.

00:51:10.240 --> 00:51:12.110
It was fairly successful.

00:51:12.110 --> 00:51:13.710
And that works often with MIT.

00:51:13.710 --> 00:51:17.660
People were sort of data driven.

00:51:17.660 --> 00:51:23.388
The other thing about
equity-- when you get beyond--

00:51:24.414 --> 00:51:25.580
I'll mention it in a moment.

00:51:25.580 --> 00:51:29.570
We're going to switch
over now to employees

00:51:29.570 --> 00:51:30.600
and outside contractors.

00:51:33.630 --> 00:51:36.206
This is the slide from
Charlie the other night.

00:51:36.206 --> 00:51:37.960
He included in here
about how to think

00:51:37.960 --> 00:51:41.140
about equity with employees.

00:51:41.140 --> 00:51:49.751
One of the issues with employees
is does stock motivate.

00:51:49.751 --> 00:51:50.750
Does it really motivate.

00:51:50.750 --> 00:51:54.490
If you've never actually
been in a company

00:51:54.490 --> 00:51:59.010
and had an event occur
where that piece of paper

00:51:59.010 --> 00:52:01.550
was enough money to buy a
nice car or a down payment

00:52:01.550 --> 00:52:04.930
on a house or something--
it's just a piece of paper.

00:52:04.930 --> 00:52:09.200
The first job I had out of MIT
was with a spin-off company

00:52:09.200 --> 00:52:10.640
from Pugh-Roberts.

00:52:10.640 --> 00:52:12.860
Ed Roberts at Sloan School.

00:52:12.860 --> 00:52:17.640
We were in a triple decker
house up on [? Leigh ?] Street.

00:52:17.640 --> 00:52:18.920
I was the third employee.

00:52:18.920 --> 00:52:22.490
We had the third floor
because his other company

00:52:22.490 --> 00:52:25.310
was on the nice floors.

00:52:25.310 --> 00:52:26.870
And so the first
day I get there,

00:52:26.870 --> 00:52:29.050
I come sort of mid
morning, it's time.

00:52:29.050 --> 00:52:32.500
I've got to go down, use the
bathroom after all a coffee.

00:52:32.500 --> 00:52:34.660
So the bathroom was
one of those half baths

00:52:34.660 --> 00:52:38.960
under the stairway under
these triple decker houses.

00:52:38.960 --> 00:52:42.200
So I go down there, I open
the door, and I look in.

00:52:42.200 --> 00:52:45.970
And the entire wall
this little half bath

00:52:45.970 --> 00:52:49.335
is papered with what looks
like real stock certificates.

00:52:49.335 --> 00:52:51.335
I mean first of all, I
thought it was wallpaper.

00:52:51.335 --> 00:52:52.770
That's sort of a
weird wallpaper.

00:52:52.770 --> 00:52:53.353
Then I looked.

00:52:53.353 --> 00:52:55.850
They're real stock certificates.

00:52:55.850 --> 00:52:58.230
So clearly they weren't
worth a whole lot if they

00:52:58.230 --> 00:53:00.160
were wallpapering a bathroom.

00:53:00.160 --> 00:53:01.630
So to me it said two things.

00:53:01.630 --> 00:53:07.160
One is if you don't want
to work for wallpaper,

00:53:07.160 --> 00:53:08.550
get back to work.

00:53:08.550 --> 00:53:12.030
And secondly, what is
this stuff called stock.

00:53:12.030 --> 00:53:17.000
So a lot of employees-- you
shouldn't assume right away

00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:20.770
that equity motivates people.

00:53:20.770 --> 00:53:22.670
People don't understand
it many cases.

00:53:22.670 --> 00:53:26.540
There was a story about
Prime Computer and Bose,

00:53:26.540 --> 00:53:28.600
where they were
recruiting an engineer.

00:53:28.600 --> 00:53:31.920
And they basically had
the same cash salary.

00:53:31.920 --> 00:53:35.100
But one company was
offering twice as much stock

00:53:35.100 --> 00:53:37.210
as the other-- number of shares.

00:53:37.210 --> 00:53:41.540
And what was not clear was that
they had the same market value.

00:53:41.540 --> 00:53:45.271
One stock was worth twice as
much per share as the other.

00:53:45.271 --> 00:53:47.770
So the perception, if you're
not used to dealing with stock,

00:53:47.770 --> 00:53:50.040
that people automatically
understand how it works.

00:53:50.040 --> 00:53:52.220
You shouldn't assume.

00:53:52.220 --> 00:53:56.890
There is a market for labor if
you're in certain industries--

00:53:56.890 --> 00:53:58.400
you're going to
need to give equity

00:53:58.400 --> 00:54:00.190
to bring in the good people.

00:54:00.190 --> 00:54:01.940
But you really have
to think about that.

00:54:01.940 --> 00:54:04.050
Don't just go pattern
thinking about.

00:54:04.050 --> 00:54:06.200
Oh everyone gets
stock because that's

00:54:06.200 --> 00:54:07.800
the way everyone does things.

00:54:07.800 --> 00:54:09.150
You have to think about that.

00:54:12.690 --> 00:54:17.920
So the question is if
you're starting a company

00:54:17.920 --> 00:54:19.810
and you're going
out and let's say

00:54:19.810 --> 00:54:22.440
you're successful in raising
some outside money, what

00:54:22.440 --> 00:54:27.310
fraction of the equity goes into
the equity compensation pool.

00:54:27.310 --> 00:54:30.270
Well Charlie had
that nice template

00:54:30.270 --> 00:54:31.630
for financial projections.

00:54:31.630 --> 00:54:33.260
And he had a head count.

00:54:33.260 --> 00:54:37.690
And as you recall, he matched
the head count to equity

00:54:37.690 --> 00:54:39.790
based on the type of position.

00:54:39.790 --> 00:54:43.270
And the initial stock
pool for companies

00:54:43.270 --> 00:54:48.740
is usually two to three years
worth of the head count plan.

00:54:48.740 --> 00:54:51.680
Now what does that translate
if your venture-backed.

00:54:51.680 --> 00:54:54.860
In my experience, at first
round venture financing,

00:54:54.860 --> 00:54:58.500
you're probably going to have
somewhere between 12% and 18%

00:54:58.500 --> 00:55:03.260
of the total equity
reserved for employees.

00:55:03.260 --> 00:55:04.910
It'll be at the
lower end of that

00:55:04.910 --> 00:55:07.570
if you've got more of
your team fleshed out.

00:55:07.570 --> 00:55:10.010
It'll be at the higher end or
even higher if it's just you

00:55:10.010 --> 00:55:11.860
and you've got to
hire in some people.

00:55:11.860 --> 00:55:14.470
But that's a reasonable
rule of thumb.

00:55:14.470 --> 00:55:16.610
And for most equity
plans, you're

00:55:16.610 --> 00:55:20.550
going to think about
employees, directors, and maybe

00:55:20.550 --> 00:55:21.050
consultants.

00:55:24.140 --> 00:55:26.350
And if you try to
calibrate this,

00:55:26.350 --> 00:55:28.160
there are surveys
and places you can

00:55:28.160 --> 00:55:31.680
go to see what the market is
for different types of equity

00:55:31.680 --> 00:55:33.219
grants.

00:55:33.219 --> 00:55:34.760
Again, from Charlie's
slides, just as

00:55:34.760 --> 00:55:35.860
a reminder in one place.

00:55:35.860 --> 00:55:37.580
These were some
ownership percentages

00:55:37.580 --> 00:55:41.730
he talked about after
two rounds of financing.

00:55:41.730 --> 00:55:44.080
And you will always end
up granting more later

00:55:44.080 --> 00:55:45.430
to keep people incented.

00:55:48.310 --> 00:55:51.950
This was his spreadsheet
with dilution showing.

00:55:51.950 --> 00:55:53.550
I just put it here
for reference.

00:55:53.550 --> 00:55:55.260
[? Yonald ?] is going
to do a great job

00:55:55.260 --> 00:55:57.312
on the last night
of the class where

00:55:57.312 --> 00:55:59.520
he's going to walk you
through what actually happened

00:55:59.520 --> 00:56:02.250
to employees and
founders and investors.

00:56:02.250 --> 00:56:07.970
So I think we'll let him get
into that in more detail.

00:56:07.970 --> 00:56:12.680
Now we'll run through common
forms of equity compensation.

00:56:12.680 --> 00:56:14.972
There's restricted stock.

00:56:14.972 --> 00:56:16.430
And there are two
types of options.

00:56:16.430 --> 00:56:18.550
One is an incentive
stock option,

00:56:18.550 --> 00:56:22.300
which has certain tax benefits
and their non-qualified.

00:56:22.300 --> 00:56:28.030
Again, restricted stock is
stock that's granted to somebody

00:56:28.030 --> 00:56:33.100
or sold to somebody and it
starts a capital gains holding

00:56:33.100 --> 00:56:36.580
period for tax and SCC.

00:56:36.580 --> 00:56:39.110
It's usually subject to vesting.

00:56:39.110 --> 00:56:42.150
Charlie talked about vesting.

00:56:42.150 --> 00:56:45.680
And you may want to file
an 83(b) election because

00:56:45.680 --> 00:56:47.540
of the vesting.

00:56:47.540 --> 00:56:50.850
You can read more about
that in the Founder's Memo.

00:56:50.850 --> 00:56:53.290
Incentive stock
options are options

00:56:53.290 --> 00:56:55.860
to comply with tax requirements.

00:56:55.860 --> 00:56:58.970
They're granted
only to employees.

00:56:58.970 --> 00:57:01.450
And they have to be
granted at an exercise

00:57:01.450 --> 00:57:02.787
price that's fair market value.

00:57:02.787 --> 00:57:03.620
What does that mean.

00:57:03.620 --> 00:57:06.290
That means you can buy
100 shares of stock

00:57:06.290 --> 00:57:07.900
at today's price.

00:57:07.900 --> 00:57:10.370
And the theory is that
hopefully, over time the stock

00:57:10.370 --> 00:57:11.500
goes up.

00:57:11.500 --> 00:57:14.810
Maybe it's $10 exercised and
when a person exercises it,

00:57:14.810 --> 00:57:15.830
it's $100.

00:57:15.830 --> 00:57:20.570
So they pay $10 and they
get stock worth $100.

00:57:20.570 --> 00:57:25.400
And those exercise vesting
occur over time, typically.

00:57:25.400 --> 00:57:26.470
And there's no tax on it.

00:57:26.470 --> 00:57:28.960
You're not taxed when
you get the stock.

00:57:28.960 --> 00:57:32.530
There may be an alternative
minimum tax issue.

00:57:32.530 --> 00:57:35.000
Again, a placeholder
for you to think about.

00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:37.910
And there will be taxation
on the sale of the stock.

00:57:37.910 --> 00:57:40.910
And if you end up following
the holding period,

00:57:40.910 --> 00:57:43.610
you'll have capital gains,
which is a good thing.

00:57:43.610 --> 00:57:45.470
And that's one year
from the exercise

00:57:45.470 --> 00:57:49.220
and two years from
the date of grant.

00:57:49.220 --> 00:57:53.040
And non-qualified
are basically options

00:57:53.040 --> 00:57:58.480
that have no tax on
vesting or grant,

00:57:58.480 --> 00:58:02.620
but ordinary income on exercise.

00:58:02.620 --> 00:58:06.007
So that means when you
exercise the difference

00:58:06.007 --> 00:58:08.215
between the exercise price
and the fair market value,

00:58:08.215 --> 00:58:10.420
you have to pay-- it's
like somebody gave you

00:58:10.420 --> 00:58:12.080
that much cash.

00:58:12.080 --> 00:58:15.370
Now these instruments of
founder stock, restricted stock

00:58:15.370 --> 00:58:19.750
options, and non-qualifieds all
work together in sort of a way.

00:58:19.750 --> 00:58:22.860
What you really would like to
do if you're a founder or early

00:58:22.860 --> 00:58:28.120
on, you actually want to get
your stock early and then ride

00:58:28.120 --> 00:58:30.950
the appreciation.

00:58:30.950 --> 00:58:34.090
Just like you'd buy any
stock in the market.

00:58:34.090 --> 00:58:36.740
What happens though if
you're given stock--

00:58:36.740 --> 00:58:39.870
you have income when
you get the stock

00:58:39.870 --> 00:58:41.120
based on the market value.

00:58:41.120 --> 00:58:45.300
So over time, as the company
raises more rounds of funding,

00:58:45.300 --> 00:58:46.930
it becomes more
expensive for someone

00:58:46.930 --> 00:58:50.020
to actually acquire
the stock directly.

00:58:50.020 --> 00:58:52.604
And since there's no
market for the stock,

00:58:52.604 --> 00:58:54.020
you're in a situation
where you're

00:58:54.020 --> 00:58:55.780
taxed on the stock but no exit.

00:58:55.780 --> 00:58:57.560
You have no way to pay it.

00:58:57.560 --> 00:59:00.070
So that's when people
switch over and use options.

00:59:00.070 --> 00:59:03.630
Because options-- you're not
taxed when you get an option.

00:59:03.630 --> 00:59:06.290
You sort of control
when the tax occurs.

00:59:06.290 --> 00:59:10.290
So that's just a general
theme to think about.

00:59:10.290 --> 00:59:12.402
Vesting.

00:59:12.402 --> 00:59:14.110
There are basically
two types of vesting.

00:59:14.110 --> 00:59:18.150
Time-based vesting and
performance vesting.

00:59:18.150 --> 00:59:21.600
What you're really trying to
do is you go into it thinking,

00:59:21.600 --> 00:59:23.720
well, we have a set of
things we need to get done.

00:59:23.720 --> 00:59:26.370
And you want to provide
incentives for people to do it.

00:59:26.370 --> 00:59:28.099
And so in an ideal
world you'd know

00:59:28.099 --> 00:59:29.390
exactly what needed to be done.

00:59:29.390 --> 00:59:32.300
And you'd say, when you
deliver the first prototype,

00:59:32.300 --> 00:59:34.630
you vest on and
50% of your option.

00:59:34.630 --> 00:59:37.495
And when we do our first
customer ship, another 25%.

00:59:38.680 --> 00:59:41.090
The problem is it's
never that clean.

00:59:41.090 --> 00:59:44.120
You're never quite sure.

00:59:44.120 --> 00:59:48.060
And so the default
tends to be time.

00:59:48.060 --> 00:59:50.300
We're going to be in this
for a period of time.

00:59:50.300 --> 00:59:53.210
If you're here pulling
on the oar with a team,

00:59:53.210 --> 00:59:54.830
then you'll vest.

00:59:54.830 --> 00:59:58.960
Typical vesting is
a one year cliff.

00:59:58.960 --> 01:00:01.770
That means if you're
here less than a year you

01:00:01.770 --> 01:00:04.100
don't get anything.

01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:07.219
After one year it's usually 25%.

01:00:07.219 --> 01:00:09.760
And then it's either monthly or
quarterly over the next three

01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:10.259
years.

01:00:10.259 --> 01:00:12.730
So at the end of four
years, you're fully vested

01:00:12.730 --> 01:00:16.170
and have rights in the stock.

01:00:16.170 --> 01:00:18.310
I put something in here
about accelerated vesting

01:00:18.310 --> 01:00:20.432
on changing control.

01:00:20.432 --> 01:00:21.390
You'll hear about that.

01:00:21.390 --> 01:00:23.010
And there are a whole bunch
of issues about whether that

01:00:23.010 --> 01:00:23.870
makes any sense.

01:00:23.870 --> 01:00:27.020
So keep that in mind.

01:00:27.020 --> 01:00:30.290
You have to think about what
happens if someone leaves.

01:00:30.290 --> 01:00:34.190
You gave them this equity and
do you get to buy it back.

01:00:34.190 --> 01:00:35.560
Do they forfeit it.

01:00:35.560 --> 01:00:37.500
What if they leave
under bad circumstances

01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:39.690
where they gave
away trade secrets.

01:00:39.690 --> 01:00:43.102
And what if they violate
non-competition agreements.

01:00:43.102 --> 01:00:44.810
So you probably want
to think about those

01:00:44.810 --> 01:00:46.450
in the design of your plan.

01:00:46.450 --> 01:00:48.100
And again, think of
this as a checklist

01:00:48.100 --> 01:00:51.380
when you're dealing with
your lawyer on this.

01:00:51.380 --> 01:00:54.980
Have they talked
about these things.

01:00:54.980 --> 01:01:00.340
Now suppose you actually
have the stock and you leave.

01:01:00.340 --> 01:01:01.050
What's the deal.

01:01:01.050 --> 01:01:04.956
Do you get to keep
it when you leave.

01:01:04.956 --> 01:01:09.360
Do you have to sell it
back at then fair value.

01:01:09.360 --> 01:01:09.890
Never.

01:01:09.890 --> 01:01:13.380
I mean, these are
philosophical issues

01:01:13.380 --> 01:01:15.002
that the Founder's
Memo talks about.

01:01:15.002 --> 01:01:16.460
And at the beginning
is a good time

01:01:16.460 --> 01:01:17.510
to talk about it
because you don't

01:01:17.510 --> 01:01:18.801
know who's going to be leaving.

01:01:18.801 --> 01:01:21.110
So it's sort of a
neutral thing about what

01:01:21.110 --> 01:01:22.450
your philosophy is going to be.

01:01:26.370 --> 01:01:30.430
Over time, on a people
issue, at the beginning

01:01:30.430 --> 01:01:33.570
the whole issue of boards-- I
put independent directors here.

01:01:33.570 --> 01:01:37.520
Somewhere around the
time of first funding.

01:01:37.520 --> 01:01:40.050
Funding people are
going to want to come in

01:01:40.050 --> 01:01:41.550
and the venture
capitalists actually

01:01:41.550 --> 01:01:43.508
do have to get some board
seats under the rules

01:01:43.508 --> 01:01:45.620
that they operate under.

01:01:45.620 --> 01:01:47.290
There's often an
independent director

01:01:47.290 --> 01:01:48.620
that they'll negotiate.

01:01:48.620 --> 01:01:50.670
So you want to be
thinking ahead.

01:01:50.670 --> 01:01:54.870
Who's an independent director
that could be on my board

01:01:54.870 --> 01:01:56.900
and acceptable to venture.

01:01:56.900 --> 01:01:59.680
Because if you don't
have a candidate in mind

01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:01.870
they certainly
will talk about it.

01:02:04.490 --> 01:02:06.982
OK, financing.

01:02:06.982 --> 01:02:09.190
I'm going to run you quickly
through securities laws.

01:02:13.357 --> 01:02:14.940
Essentially, this
is an area you don't

01:02:14.940 --> 01:02:18.470
want to try to do brain
surgery yourself with.

01:02:18.470 --> 01:02:21.460
You can get into
really big troubles.

01:02:21.460 --> 01:02:26.370
Any offer or even an
offer of securities

01:02:26.370 --> 01:02:28.910
has to be registered with
the Securities and Exchange

01:02:28.910 --> 01:02:30.200
Commission.

01:02:30.200 --> 01:02:35.400
And that could be a big
expensive proposition.

01:02:35.400 --> 01:02:37.410
So you want to think
about exemptions.

01:02:37.410 --> 01:02:39.994
There are exemptions there
for private placements.

01:02:39.994 --> 01:02:41.410
And there's certain
rules you have

01:02:41.410 --> 01:02:44.780
to do in following it through.

01:02:44.780 --> 01:02:51.390
What you don't want
to do is-- question

01:02:51.390 --> 01:02:53.704
is, if you don't comply,
what is the big deal.

01:02:53.704 --> 01:02:55.870
Well, first of all, it's
criminal-- can be criminal.

01:02:55.870 --> 01:02:59.140
And it could be personal
liability on the founder.

01:02:59.140 --> 01:03:02.400
In other words, they can get
their money back from you.

01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:03.480
And it could be a mess.

01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:06.360
And in the materials,
under Resources, there's

01:03:06.360 --> 01:03:09.540
a column I did for Boston
Business Journal that

01:03:09.540 --> 01:03:12.490
talked about a company that
really got into bad trouble

01:03:12.490 --> 01:03:14.470
because they screwed up on this.

01:03:14.470 --> 01:03:16.890
So my red letter
thing here is, don't,

01:03:16.890 --> 01:03:21.110
in a business plan, put
language in that offers to sell.

01:03:21.110 --> 01:03:25.440
We're offering 10% of the
company for $2 million.

01:03:25.440 --> 01:03:27.940
How do you say
that's not an offer.

01:03:27.940 --> 01:03:30.480
So the business plan or
any of the documents,

01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:32.510
really, is this
is an opportunity.

01:03:32.510 --> 01:03:33.820
We're addressing this market.

01:03:33.820 --> 01:03:35.840
The market's this big.

01:03:35.840 --> 01:03:38.420
And you might say, and
the resources we need

01:03:38.420 --> 01:03:39.860
is this amount.

01:03:39.860 --> 01:03:41.484
If people are
interested in that,

01:03:41.484 --> 01:03:43.400
they're going to have a
conversation with you.

01:03:43.400 --> 01:03:47.470
And you can handle
it in a careful way.

01:03:47.470 --> 01:03:50.350
But I see over and over again,
people putting in plans.

01:03:50.350 --> 01:03:51.995
First of all, it's
presumptuous, right?

01:03:55.680 --> 01:03:58.605
Have a discussion
with the investor

01:03:58.605 --> 01:03:59.980
and you can get
down the numbers.

01:03:59.980 --> 01:04:01.604
But certainly don't
put it in the plan.

01:04:04.030 --> 01:04:06.090
We do have now
crowdfunding coming along.

01:04:06.090 --> 01:04:09.170
We're waiting for some SEC
rules to get a little bit more

01:04:09.170 --> 01:04:09.700
refined.

01:04:09.700 --> 01:04:11.866
That's going to open up a
whole other set of issues.

01:04:11.866 --> 01:04:15.580
But it may be a good way-- just
like crowdfunding for products

01:04:15.580 --> 01:04:20.110
has been around-- this is
crowdfunding for selling stock

01:04:20.110 --> 01:04:22.170
or interest in the company.

01:04:22.170 --> 01:04:23.862
I don't know enough
yet to explain how

01:04:23.862 --> 01:04:25.070
that's going to work for you.

01:04:25.070 --> 01:04:27.815
But keep an eye on
that separately.

01:04:31.150 --> 01:04:35.130
I put in a section in the deck
looking at capital structure

01:04:35.130 --> 01:04:36.065
instruments.

01:04:36.065 --> 01:04:37.910
For some people,
this is old hat.

01:04:37.910 --> 01:04:40.162
For the people that
aren't, this is

01:04:40.162 --> 01:04:41.370
something you should look at.

01:04:41.370 --> 01:04:43.495
It just talks about different
kinds of instruments.

01:04:43.495 --> 01:04:45.680
At the bottom is common stock.

01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:50.010
Common stock is what's the
value after everyone else has

01:04:50.010 --> 01:04:50.790
gotten paid.

01:04:50.790 --> 01:04:56.070
So if you're Bill Gates and you
own common stock in Microsoft,

01:04:56.070 --> 01:04:58.990
you're like the richest
guy in the world.

01:04:58.990 --> 01:05:03.470
If you're a startup, this
might be worth nothing.

01:05:03.470 --> 01:05:04.920
Above it are
different instruments

01:05:04.920 --> 01:05:06.920
that you can play with.

01:05:06.920 --> 01:05:09.600
And for the non-Sloan
people, take a look

01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:11.460
at the next few slides
that describe this.

01:05:11.460 --> 01:05:15.770
I'm just going to zip
through them, given the time.

01:05:15.770 --> 01:05:18.450
This visual just shows
what a capital structure

01:05:18.450 --> 01:05:19.550
will look like over time.

01:05:19.550 --> 01:05:22.610
At a startup, it's
primarily all common.

01:05:22.610 --> 01:05:24.560
And by the time you're
Microsoft or an LBO,

01:05:24.560 --> 01:05:28.500
you see more complex
capital structures.

01:05:28.500 --> 01:05:31.160
That's your instant
MBA course for people

01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:34.520
not in the MBA program.

01:05:34.520 --> 01:05:38.470
We talked about convertible
note financing the other night.

01:05:38.470 --> 01:05:41.380
Traditionally this bridged
from one round to another

01:05:41.380 --> 01:05:44.440
as you were trying to
keep the company going.

01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:49.550
It has the benefit of being
quick, relatively inexpensive,

01:05:49.550 --> 01:05:52.530
and it can avoid
valuation issues.

01:05:52.530 --> 01:05:55.240
So a classic problem
is the first run

01:05:55.240 --> 01:05:58.340
investors value the
company too high.

01:05:58.340 --> 01:05:59.789
The next round
comes in and says,

01:05:59.789 --> 01:06:01.830
we're never going to pay
that much because things

01:06:01.830 --> 01:06:03.620
have happened or whatever.

01:06:03.620 --> 01:06:06.390
And the first round has to
have this discussion-- how

01:06:06.390 --> 01:06:09.490
they get crammed down in their
percentage of the company.

01:06:09.490 --> 01:06:11.830
Convertible note allows
you to sort of not

01:06:11.830 --> 01:06:14.705
set that actual
valuation until later.

01:06:14.705 --> 01:06:16.080
There's a good
discussion of this

01:06:16.080 --> 01:06:19.780
at startupcompanylawyer.com,
which

01:06:19.780 --> 01:06:21.430
talks about the pros and cons.

01:06:21.430 --> 01:06:24.880
So again, another
resource to look at.

01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:27.530
This is an example
of a term sheet.

01:06:27.530 --> 01:06:30.820
If you go to firms--
like Cooly LLP

01:06:30.820 --> 01:06:34.170
has a nice, open
source models of what

01:06:34.170 --> 01:06:35.440
the documents look like.

01:06:35.440 --> 01:06:38.480
There's also some good
resources at Wilson Sonsini

01:06:38.480 --> 01:06:40.210
and at Goodwin Procter.

01:06:40.210 --> 01:06:42.950
Much more accessible these
days than they were back

01:06:42.950 --> 01:06:45.860
when I was starting out.

01:06:45.860 --> 01:06:49.340
Now we're going to run quickly
through angel and venture

01:06:49.340 --> 01:06:49.840
funding.

01:06:53.900 --> 01:06:56.150
A typical way to do this
is you take a term sheet

01:06:56.150 --> 01:06:57.610
and you take it
apart and you talk

01:06:57.610 --> 01:07:01.180
about each of the little
components of the term sheet.

01:07:01.180 --> 01:07:03.610
And that's a useful
way to do it.

01:07:03.610 --> 01:07:05.460
I think the way
for an entrepreneur

01:07:05.460 --> 01:07:09.130
to think about why all these
terms is to understand what

01:07:09.130 --> 01:07:11.990
the major deal elements are.

01:07:11.990 --> 01:07:15.160
And from an investor viewpoint,
it's these four elements.

01:07:15.160 --> 01:07:19.050
One is a preferred return,
for reasons we'll talk about.

01:07:19.050 --> 01:07:22.920
Protection of valuation and
position versus future money

01:07:22.920 --> 01:07:24.590
that comes in.

01:07:24.590 --> 01:07:27.050
The requirement to manage
the investment and the exit

01:07:27.050 --> 01:07:29.540
strategy.

01:07:29.540 --> 01:07:32.990
So for example, if you
think a preferred return,

01:07:32.990 --> 01:07:38.770
an investor looks at you and
he sees a plan or a promise.

01:07:38.770 --> 01:07:40.120
The investor writes a check.

01:07:40.120 --> 01:07:42.690
The investor has
basically done everything

01:07:42.690 --> 01:07:44.820
that he said he would do.

01:07:44.820 --> 01:07:46.660
He'll be there to
advise and all that.

01:07:46.660 --> 01:07:48.250
But basically he'll
want his money.

01:07:48.250 --> 01:07:51.860
The entrepreneur
hasn't done anything

01:07:51.860 --> 01:07:53.110
from the investor perspective.

01:07:53.110 --> 01:07:56.900
They put together a plan
that's yet to be executed on.

01:07:56.900 --> 01:07:59.750
And so the result is
the investor typically

01:07:59.750 --> 01:08:04.010
wants to get paid before
the entrepreneur gets paid.

01:08:04.010 --> 01:08:05.750
He gets his money back first.

01:08:05.750 --> 01:08:08.150
And the instrument is usually
the convertible preferred

01:08:08.150 --> 01:08:10.260
stock.

01:08:10.260 --> 01:08:13.730
It usually has dividends.

01:08:13.730 --> 01:08:17.479
And an important part is
the liquidation preference.

01:08:17.479 --> 01:08:19.029
So the liquidation
preference says,

01:08:19.029 --> 01:08:21.020
look, there are two types.

01:08:21.020 --> 01:08:23.750
One is a straight preference.

01:08:23.750 --> 01:08:26.850
It says, if the company-- we
have a liquidation-- which I'll

01:08:26.850 --> 01:08:30.060
talk about what that means
in a moment-- the investor

01:08:30.060 --> 01:08:33.560
can either choose
to get the money he

01:08:33.560 --> 01:08:36.000
put in back pluses dividends.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.920
Or you can convert, because
it's usually convertible,

01:08:38.920 --> 01:08:41.830
into whatever the convertible
amount of the company would be.

01:08:41.830 --> 01:08:45.010
So it's simply a math exercise.

01:08:45.010 --> 01:08:46.830
That's a straight
liquidation preference.

01:08:46.830 --> 01:08:49.520
A participating or
double dip is one

01:08:49.520 --> 01:08:53.340
that's not particularly good in
many cases for an entrepreneur.

01:08:53.340 --> 01:08:56.260
It says the investor
gets his money back first

01:08:56.260 --> 01:08:59.810
and then he converts and
pretends he was like you

01:08:59.810 --> 01:09:03.240
and gets a percentage
of the company.

01:09:03.240 --> 01:09:06.970
I put a chart in comparing
how that math works.

01:09:06.970 --> 01:09:08.930
I think it's pretty
self explanatory if you

01:09:08.930 --> 01:09:11.819
look at it in the materials.

01:09:11.819 --> 01:09:15.569
And I put a case in
here which says--

01:09:15.569 --> 01:09:16.870
there are two cases presented.

01:09:16.870 --> 01:09:20.060
One is, a founder sells 40%
of the company for $5 million

01:09:20.060 --> 01:09:23.760
of convertible preferred,
with a $5 million

01:09:23.760 --> 01:09:27.319
liquidation preference.

01:09:27.319 --> 01:09:28.899
But no participating rights.

01:09:28.899 --> 01:09:33.510
In Case B, they sell
33% of the company

01:09:33.510 --> 01:09:36.689
with participating preferred.

01:09:36.689 --> 01:09:40.130
And this example shows
you the trade off.

01:09:40.130 --> 01:09:43.050
Essentially, in this
case, if the exit

01:09:43.050 --> 01:09:46.330
is $35 million or less,
than the first case

01:09:46.330 --> 01:09:48.880
is better for the founders,
which means actually

01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:51.250
giving up a bigger
percentage of the company

01:09:51.250 --> 01:09:53.337
and having a straight preferred.

01:09:53.337 --> 01:09:54.795
So take a look at
that after class.

01:09:58.360 --> 01:10:01.155
The liquidation events
could be really liquidation,

01:10:01.155 --> 01:10:03.300
meaning the company's shut down.

01:10:03.300 --> 01:10:06.810
But it's often defined
to be a merger.

01:10:06.810 --> 01:10:12.370
So if the company is acquired,
the liquidation kicks in.

01:10:12.370 --> 01:10:14.200
That's the preferred
return part as you

01:10:14.200 --> 01:10:17.480
look through the term sheet.

01:10:17.480 --> 01:10:19.420
The second major
element is protection

01:10:19.420 --> 01:10:22.470
of value and position
versus future money

01:10:22.470 --> 01:10:27.090
and that's where anti-dilution
protection comes in.

01:10:27.090 --> 01:10:30.690
And I give you an example
of a term sheet with that.

01:10:33.450 --> 01:10:37.430
Anti-dilution and
conversion go hand in hand.

01:10:37.430 --> 01:10:40.670
So typically, a
convertible-preferred

01:10:40.670 --> 01:10:41.920
trades one for one.

01:10:41.920 --> 01:10:44.800
One share of preferred
converts to one share

01:10:44.800 --> 01:10:46.860
of common at the beginning.

01:10:46.860 --> 01:10:48.930
And anti-dilution
says, if an event

01:10:48.930 --> 01:10:55.740
occurs in which you issue
stock for less money

01:10:55.740 --> 01:10:58.540
or priced less
than price I paid,

01:10:58.540 --> 01:11:01.790
then when I convert I
want to get more shares.

01:11:01.790 --> 01:11:05.300
Because your value of
the company's gone down.

01:11:05.300 --> 01:11:08.470
I came in at this level
and you did something.

01:11:08.470 --> 01:11:11.550
You didn't grow the company,
you made the value go down,

01:11:11.550 --> 01:11:13.500
and therefore I need
to get compensated.

01:11:16.310 --> 01:11:19.410
And the two main types of
these is the full ratchet,

01:11:19.410 --> 01:11:21.580
which is really bad
for an entrepreneur.

01:11:21.580 --> 01:11:24.550
That says if I issue
even one share of stock

01:11:24.550 --> 01:11:27.680
for less money than what
you, the investor, put in,

01:11:27.680 --> 01:11:29.820
then the price of that
one share of stock

01:11:29.820 --> 01:11:32.160
becomes a conversion price.

01:11:32.160 --> 01:11:37.640
So if I converted at $10 a share
and you issued one share at $1,

01:11:37.640 --> 01:11:40.880
now all my money
converts at $1 a share.

01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:43.046
So I get 10 times more.

01:11:43.046 --> 01:11:44.920
The more typical one is
the weighted average.

01:11:44.920 --> 01:11:46.420
And there's a formula
for that that.

01:11:46.420 --> 01:11:50.350
It looks at the
price and the amount.

01:11:50.350 --> 01:11:52.790
On the resources page there
are a bunch of venture capital

01:11:52.790 --> 01:11:55.020
terms that will help
explain a lot of what

01:11:55.020 --> 01:11:57.980
we went through here.

01:11:57.980 --> 01:12:01.150
And that brings us
to borrow, which

01:12:01.150 --> 01:12:04.900
is we're going to go into
negotiation skills, in Yost

01:12:04.900 --> 01:12:07.350
you're doing organization
and people issues.

01:12:07.350 --> 01:12:08.065
Tomorrow?

01:12:08.065 --> 01:12:10.390
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:12:12.639 --> 01:12:14.680
JOE HADZIMA: So I raced
you through a whole bunch

01:12:14.680 --> 01:12:17.420
of legal stuff that we
could have spend hours

01:12:17.420 --> 01:12:18.980
on each portion of it.

01:12:18.980 --> 01:12:23.270
Again, I want to step back,
say, take the deck that's there,

01:12:23.270 --> 01:12:26.440
read through it, and use
it as sort of a guidepost

01:12:26.440 --> 01:12:28.320
as you go forward on
some of the stuff.

01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:31.400
There are plenty of resources
that I've mentioned that you

01:12:31.400 --> 01:12:32.850
can sort of self educate.

01:12:32.850 --> 01:12:36.077
I'm happy to chat with you
offline about those things.

01:12:36.077 --> 01:12:38.160
I know no other way to get
it out in front of you,

01:12:38.160 --> 01:12:40.900
short of having you take
a whole legal course.

01:12:40.900 --> 01:12:43.350
So hopefully you'll find that.

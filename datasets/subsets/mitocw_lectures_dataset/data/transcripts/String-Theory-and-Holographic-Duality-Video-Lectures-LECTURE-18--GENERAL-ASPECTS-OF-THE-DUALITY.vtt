00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:22.380
HONG LIU: OK.

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:28.260
So last time, we talked
about this IR-UV connection

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.120
between the bulk
and the boundary.

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:34.810
So the key thing is-- let me
write down the metric here,

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:38.230
the Ads metric in this
Poincare coordinate.

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:51.190
So this is the boundaries
are equal to zero.

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.300
And when you increase
z, you go to interior.

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.650
And then for each
constant, z, you

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.240
have a Minkowski space time.

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:02.880
You have a Minkowski d.

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.670
So this is Ads d plus 1.

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:11.520
So each slice is a d
dimension Minkowski space.

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.230
And due to this redshift
factor, the more

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:20.610
you go to the interior
of the space time,

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.390
then corresponding
to the lower energy

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.750
process when viewed
form the field theory.

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:32.280
So here, the same
process is happening here

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.370
compared to happening here,
and here corresponding

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:38.350
to the IR process, and
the [INAUDIBLE] boundary

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.980
corresponding to the UV process.

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:49.610
So this is a key
relation between the bulk

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.500
and the boundary theories.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.480
And also, this gives you
an intuitive understanding

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:58.070
where does this actual dimension
come from from the field theory

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:59.540
point of view.

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.030
Then from the field
theory perspective,

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.820
this actual dimension can be
considered as a geometrization

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.720
of the energy scale.

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.260
And we know that the physics
change with the energy scale

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.150
from the field
theory point of view.

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.340
It's called the
normalization group flow,

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.330
how physics evolves when you
change the energy or length

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:23.320
scale.

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.430
In the field theory, it's
called normalization group flow.

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.610
So you can also view that the
evolution in the gravity side,

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.320
say from the boundary
to the interior,

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:38.670
and that this flow
in the z direction

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:44.550
can be considered,
again, to geometrize

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.753
the normalization group
flow of the field theory.

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:50.851
So any questions regarding this?

00:02:58.831 --> 00:02:59.330
Good.

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.725
So now let's talk about some
further aspects of the duality.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.460
So the duality is
that once you realize

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:14.400
there's such relation, since
the two sides are completely

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.670
different objects, so the
game is that you really

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:21.196
have to do lots of guess work.

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:26.430
Essentially, you have
two sides if you want

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.960
to relate things on two sides.

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:33.710
And you have to do guess work.

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:36.920
How does this quantity translate
into that quantity, et cetera?

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.410
And then check the consistency.

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:41.940
Just like you don't
know two languages,

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.180
and then you have to guess
between the two languages

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.210
and then build up
the dictionary.

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:49.300
And we will be doing the same.

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.968
We will be doing the same.

00:03:51.968 --> 00:03:52.468
Good.

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:10.540
So this is more like a review
of what we already sad.

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:18.880
So let me be more explicit.

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.671
We have N equals 4
super Yang-Mills theory.

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:28.100
We have N equals 4
super Yang-Mills theory.

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:38.930
And then here, you have type
IIB string in Ads5 times ds5.

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:41.825
So let me just write down
Ads5 just for simplicity.

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:54.024
So here on this side, there
is a conformal symmetry

00:04:54.024 --> 00:04:56.120
which we explained
before because this

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.640
is a four dimensional theory.

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:02.660
So the conformal symmetry of a
d dimensional series SO d, 2.

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:08.570
And on this side,
there's precisely

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:15.940
the same group,
which is isometry

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:21.265
of Ads5, which is
precisely also SO 4,

00:05:21.265 --> 00:05:26.440
2, which we reviewed before.

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:29.590
And you can write down the
transformation on both sides.

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:34.330
In your pset, you have
checked some of them,

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:37.230
that they actually one to
one correspond to each other.

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:40.440
For example, this special
conformal transformation.

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:44.730
And the others, like translation
or rotation, et cetera,

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:48.380
it's clear.

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:50.350
AUDIENCE: But being
the right hand side,

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:56.486
we still have some SO 5, S5.

00:05:56.486 --> 00:05:57.860
HONG LIU: I will
talk about that.

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:04.370
So this is more like
a space time symmetry.

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:09.592
So this is a space
time symmetry.

00:06:09.592 --> 00:06:13.930
From field theory point of view,
this is a space time symmetry.

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:15.770
So in N equals 4 super
Yang-Mills theory,

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:21.010
there's also global symmetry
we discussed before.

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:23.850
This is also global symmetry.

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:26.580
But this is global symmetry
associated with space time.

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:31.230
And there's also global
internal symmetry,

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:32.670
SO6 internal symmetry.

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:34.420
In N equals 4 super
Yang-Mills theory,

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:37.170
we discussed last time
there are six scalar fields.

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:39.260
You can rotate them each other.

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:42.950
And this can be considered
as coming from the D3 brane.

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:46.930
You can rotate six
transverse directions

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:54.300
the symmetry in rotating the
six transverse directions.

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:57.640
And on this side, there's
exactly the same symmetry.

00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:01.340
So now this is isometry of S5.

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:08.660
So the isometry of S5
precisely gives you SO6.

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:11.460
So you have exactly
the same SO6.

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:19.260
And we will not be explicit.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:22.081
You can also actually map the
supersymmetry between them.

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:30.350
You can also map the
supersymmetry between them.

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:32.150
So N equals 4 supersymmetry.

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:36.990
So there's a 4
supersymmetry, which

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:40.020
just comes from N equal to 4.

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:42.520
And because we have
conformal symmetry,

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:45.800
then the conformal
symmetry does not actually

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:48.190
commute with this
4 supersymmetry,

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:51.790
then generate another
4 supersymmetry.

00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:56.179
And anyway, so essentially,
you have eight supercharge

00:07:56.179 --> 00:07:56.970
of the [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:02.935
So this all together is
32 real superchargers.

00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:12.780
So when we say N
equal to 4, so this

00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:15.990
is N equal to 4 in terms of
four dimensional [INAUDIBLE].

00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:26.000
So your supersymmetry has four
[INAUDIBLE] as the supercharge.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.560
But the conformal symmetry
generates another 4.

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:31.570
So all together, you
have eight [INAUDIBLE],

00:08:31.570 --> 00:08:35.720
four dimensional [INAUDIBLE],
as the supercharge.

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:37.653
For each [INAUDIBLE]
in four dimensions,

00:08:37.653 --> 00:08:38.903
there are how many components?

00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:44.834
How many components are
there for [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:44.834 --> 00:08:45.625
in four dimensions?

00:08:45.625 --> 00:08:46.500
AUDIENCE: Four.

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:47.150
HONG LIU: Four.

00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:50.290
Because the two components,
but each component is complex.

00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:52.550
And so there are
four real components.

00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:55.990
So all together, you
have 32 real charges.

00:08:55.990 --> 00:09:00.560
And similarly, you find--
I will not do this side.

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:05.955
You find the same
amount of supersymmetry.

00:09:11.710 --> 00:09:15.730
But in this case, for
example, the low energy limit.

00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:18.630
Let's just talk about the low
energy limit of this theory.

00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:20.760
So the low energy limit,
as we said before,

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:23.420
just has to be super gravity.

00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:26.210
So it has to be super gravity.

00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:29.990
Then you find you actually
have exactly the same amount

00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:32.480
of supersymmetry
in this geometry.

00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:42.170
But the interesting thing
is that by definition,

00:09:42.170 --> 00:09:45.700
the supersymmetry on the
gravity side is actually local.

00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:47.200
So you actually
have the same amount

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:48.490
of local supersymmetries.

00:10:07.450 --> 00:10:09.650
So if you look at
this correspondence

00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:19.052
between each other, then
you actually see a pattern.

00:10:19.052 --> 00:10:20.385
So now let me make some remarks.

00:10:26.170 --> 00:10:29.570
So if you look at the
structure, this math in here,

00:10:29.570 --> 00:10:30.387
you see a pattern.

00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:35.940
On this side, all
these symmetries

00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:37.101
are global symmetries.

00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:41.510
But on this side,
all these symmetries

00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:44.880
are local symmetries.

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:47.440
So this, I just said
that in super gravity,

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:50.540
the supersymmetry is local.

00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:59.080
And the space time isometry
is just subset of a space time

00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:01.110
coordinate transformation.

00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:05.760
And space time
coordinate transformation

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:08.810
are local symmetries.

00:11:08.810 --> 00:11:19.440
So the isometry is a
subgroup of diffeomorphism.

00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:27.410
So diffeomorphism just means
the coordinate transformations.

00:11:30.194 --> 00:11:31.485
And these are local symmetries.

00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:52.580
Now we find the mapping is
on the field theory side,

00:11:52.580 --> 00:12:00.820
the global symmetries is
mapped on the gravity side

00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:02.065
into the local symmetries.

00:12:09.810 --> 00:12:12.040
So for each global symmetry
in the field theory side,

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:14.498
there's a corresponding local
symmetry on the gravity side.

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:25.500
But you may immediately ask the
question, on the gravity side,

00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:26.940
if you talk about
diffeomorphism,

00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:30.050
then this is a huge
group-- certainly much,

00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:33.330
much larger than what we are
talking about the isometry

00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:34.160
here.

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:35.910
So why we are only
talking about isometry?

00:12:41.334 --> 00:12:43.750
Why we don't talk about other
parts of the diffeomorphism,

00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:44.791
only talk about isometry?

00:12:47.579 --> 00:12:49.120
So what's special
about the isometry?

00:12:52.910 --> 00:12:56.480
So the second
remark, why isometry?

00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:03.180
Why only isometry?

00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:07.230
Why only look at the isometry?

00:13:07.230 --> 00:13:09.250
But let me just save time.

00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:23.970
So the isometry is important
for the following reason.

00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:29.180
Because even though this
is a subgroup-- so as

00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:32.480
I mentioned last time, when
we talk about quantum gravity,

00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:36.240
when we talk about string theory
and Anti-de Sitter times S5

00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:41.140
in terms of AdS5 times S5,
you should keep in mind

00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:46.091
that this AdS5 times S5 refers
to the asymptotic geometry.

00:13:46.091 --> 00:13:47.715
Because as a quantum
theory, the theory

00:13:47.715 --> 00:13:49.020
can fluctuate in the middle.

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:54.540
And the isometry can be
considered as a subgroup.

00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:03.990
But the level is even though
the space time fluctuates,

00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:07.940
but the AdS5 times S5 specifies
the asymptotic geometry

00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:09.080
of the space time.

00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:19.180
And the isometry is
precisely the subgroup

00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:34.290
which leaves the asymptotic
form of the metric invariant.

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:50.670
So these are not
ordinary diffeomorphisms.

00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:53.630
So the ordinary
diffeomorphisms--

00:14:53.630 --> 00:14:55.260
so ordinary gauge
transformations,

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:57.520
let me just say more generally.

00:14:57.520 --> 00:15:02.080
By gauge transformations,
also means the diffeomorphism

00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:05.480
or just general gauge
transformations.

00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:09.450
So when we talk about
gauge transformations, say

00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:12.630
for example, in QED
or in QCD, et cetera,

00:15:12.630 --> 00:15:20.430
we always assume-- so the
classical gauge transformation,

00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:23.920
we can see that we always
take them to be fall off

00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:25.310
sufficiently fast at infinity.

00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:46.520
When we talk about
gauge transformations,

00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:51.090
when we talk about the
typical diffeomorphisms,

00:15:51.090 --> 00:15:53.800
these are the kind of
transformations we assume

00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:56.110
goes to 1, say, at infinity.

00:15:59.850 --> 00:16:03.370
And this isometry, which
leaves the asymptotic

00:16:03.370 --> 00:16:07.147
over the metric invariant,
so these are essentially

00:16:07.147 --> 00:16:08.480
the large gauge transformations.

00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:22.430
So-called large
transformations is

00:16:22.430 --> 00:16:26.880
that they don't go to
the Identity at infinity.

00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:31.770
And of course, this is precisely
the large gauge transformations

00:16:31.770 --> 00:16:34.580
which leaves the
asymptotic invariant.

00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:42.310
So in a sense, these large
gauge transformations

00:16:42.310 --> 00:16:55.800
can be considered as the global
part of the diffeomorphism.

00:17:17.650 --> 00:17:18.894
So any questions on this?

00:17:22.310 --> 00:17:23.810
Yes?

00:17:23.810 --> 00:17:27.807
AUDIENCE: What does it mean
that those isometries are local?

00:17:27.807 --> 00:17:30.292
What do you do with
isometry [INAUDIBLE]?

00:17:33.274 --> 00:17:36.270
What do you mean when
you say that isometries--

00:17:36.270 --> 00:17:38.748
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:17:38.748 --> 00:17:40.456
These are just coordinate
transformation.

00:17:40.456 --> 00:17:43.090
A coordinate transformation is
always defined point by point,

00:17:43.090 --> 00:17:45.830
right?

00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:49.798
Just these are specific
coordinate transformations.

00:17:49.798 --> 00:17:53.130
AUDIENCE: And what happens to
gauge symmetries [INAUDIBLE]?

00:17:56.774 --> 00:17:57.440
HONG LIU: Sorry?

00:17:57.440 --> 00:17:59.440
AUDIENCE: What happens
to gauge transformations

00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:01.789
in the Yang-Mills part?

00:18:01.789 --> 00:18:02.330
HONG LIU: No.

00:18:02.330 --> 00:18:04.330
The gauge transformation
in the Yang-Mills part,

00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:06.690
you don't see it.

00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:08.400
Gauge freedom is just
redundant freedom.

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:11.870
You never see it
on the other side.

00:18:11.870 --> 00:18:16.295
AUDIENCE: Does this list
exhaust all symmetries

00:18:16.295 --> 00:18:17.570
of the Yang-Mills particle?

00:18:17.570 --> 00:18:19.984
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:18:19.984 --> 00:18:23.584
Exhausts all global symmetries
in the Yang-Mills theory part.

00:18:23.584 --> 00:18:25.876
AUDIENCE: Not local?

00:18:25.876 --> 00:18:27.250
HONG LIU: All the
global theories

00:18:27.250 --> 00:18:30.345
on the Yang-Mills side,
and not local symmetries.

00:18:30.345 --> 00:18:33.990
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
discuss them, [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:36.670
HONG LIU: There's a
u(n) gauge group there,

00:18:36.670 --> 00:18:38.890
but they don't have
correspondence in the gravity

00:18:38.890 --> 00:18:41.080
side.

00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:43.840
The reason we don't consider
the gauge symmetry, because they

00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:46.060
correspond to
redundancies and they

00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:48.869
don't have to be present
on the other side.

00:18:48.869 --> 00:18:51.410
You only need to do the physical
[INAUDIBLE] to be identical.

00:18:51.410 --> 00:18:56.960
And this also is the reason
I make this remark here.

00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:59.860
Even though all these
global symmetries,

00:18:59.860 --> 00:19:01.710
they find the corresponding
local symmetries

00:19:01.710 --> 00:19:04.210
on the gravity side.

00:19:04.210 --> 00:19:10.160
But precisely due
to this remark,

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:14.160
those things which really
map to the global symmetries

00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:15.850
in the field theory
can be considered

00:19:15.850 --> 00:19:20.759
as a global part of the local
symmetries on the gravity side.

00:19:20.759 --> 00:19:22.550
So even on the gravity
side, in some sense,

00:19:22.550 --> 00:19:24.750
you should think of them
as global symmetries.

00:19:24.750 --> 00:19:30.622
And they are large
gauge transformations.

00:19:30.622 --> 00:19:32.330
Because the ordinary
gauge transformation

00:19:32.330 --> 00:19:36.290
is just corresponding
to redundancy

00:19:36.290 --> 00:19:37.490
of degrees of freedom.

00:19:37.490 --> 00:19:40.265
And that should not be
reflected on the other side.

00:19:40.265 --> 00:19:42.640
AUDIENCE: What do you mean by
large gauge transformation?

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:44.140
HONG LIU: Large
gauge transformation

00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:47.800
means the gauge transformations
which don't vanish at infinity.

00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:49.980
So the ordinary
gauge transformation,

00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:55.400
just like in QED, in quantum
electrodynamics, when we talk

00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:57.600
about gauge transformation.

00:19:57.600 --> 00:20:00.490
The gauge transformations
we consider all the gauge

00:20:00.490 --> 00:20:02.842
transformations which
go to zero at infinity.

00:20:02.842 --> 00:20:04.800
And if you consider those
gauge transformations

00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:06.860
which don't go to
zero at infinity,

00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:09.210
and that's what we call
large gauge transformations.

00:20:09.210 --> 00:20:11.460
And those large gauge
transformations essentially

00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:16.510
is like the global part of
the u(1) gauge symmetry,

00:20:16.510 --> 00:20:18.190
in some sense can
be considered as.

00:20:21.130 --> 00:20:25.980
AUDIENCE: But that is the gauge
symmetry being gravity side.

00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:27.010
HONG LIU: That's right.

00:20:27.010 --> 00:20:33.380
So this is the part of the gauge
symmetry on the gravity side.

00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:36.510
But the part corresponding
to the boundary

00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:38.245
is the part associated
with the infinity.

00:20:44.190 --> 00:20:47.270
AUDIENCE: Here in
isometry of AdS5,

00:20:47.270 --> 00:20:49.580
we were showing,
like in p-set, it's

00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:51.980
point to point local symmetry.

00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:55.260
It's like just a
space time point.

00:20:55.260 --> 00:21:01.360
But how about this conform
in this Yang-Mills theory?

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:06.430
What is the symmetry
of the object?

00:21:06.430 --> 00:21:08.660
What kind of object does
this symmetry correspond

00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:09.884
to because it seems--

00:21:09.884 --> 00:21:11.300
HONG LIU: It's
conformal symmetry.

00:21:16.010 --> 00:21:19.635
AUDIENCE: Conformal symmetry
of the component of the field?

00:21:19.635 --> 00:21:20.510
HONG LIU: No, no, no.

00:21:20.510 --> 00:21:23.745
It's the conformal symmetry
of the Minkowski space.

00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:29.277
So on this side, you
have isometry of AdS.

00:21:29.277 --> 00:21:31.193
On the other side, you
have conformal symmetry

00:21:31.193 --> 00:21:33.052
of the Minkowski space.

00:21:33.052 --> 00:21:35.510
So you're asking what are you
corresponding to on the field

00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:36.710
theory side, right?

00:21:36.710 --> 00:21:39.550
So that's mapped to
the conformal symmetry

00:21:39.550 --> 00:21:41.547
of the Minkowski space.

00:21:46.250 --> 00:21:50.500
AUDIENCE: So the
isometry is actually

00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:52.004
large gauge transformations.

00:21:52.004 --> 00:21:52.670
HONG LIU: Right.

00:21:57.007 --> 00:21:58.590
So the story actually
is more general.

00:22:03.367 --> 00:22:05.075
So the story actually
works more general.

00:22:05.075 --> 00:22:07.533
This is the statement for the
N equal to 4 super Yang-Mills

00:22:07.533 --> 00:22:09.170
theory.

00:22:09.170 --> 00:22:10.380
So the story is more general.

00:22:22.030 --> 00:22:27.730
So in the case which you
have, say, more general,

00:22:27.730 --> 00:22:32.640
say duality between
a CFT in d dimensions

00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:43.855
in Minkowski d with the AdS
d plus 1 dimensional gravity.

00:22:47.108 --> 00:22:52.270
In any such duality, then
you always have the conformal

00:22:52.270 --> 00:23:00.150
symmetry, which is SO(d, 2)
on this here mapped to AdS

00:23:00.150 --> 00:23:00.650
isometry.

00:23:09.030 --> 00:23:11.720
And any internal
gauge symmetry, say

00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:16.080
if you have some u(s)
global symmetry here,

00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:25.320
then this will be mapped
into a u(1) gauge symmetry.

00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:36.750
Again, in the sense that
this u(s) global symmetry can

00:23:36.750 --> 00:23:40.640
be considered as the global part
of this u(1) gauge symmetry,

00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:42.443
the part which does
not vanish at infinity.

00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:51.450
And it's always the case that
global supersymmetry here

00:23:51.450 --> 00:23:57.020
would be corresponding to
the local supersymmetry here.

00:23:57.020 --> 00:23:59.870
And also in exactly
the sense that

00:23:59.870 --> 00:24:03.500
even for the local
supersymmetric transformation

00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:05.370
in the gravity
side, there's also

00:24:05.370 --> 00:24:07.586
a part which does not
vanish at infinity.

00:24:07.586 --> 00:24:08.960
And that's the
part corresponding

00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:12.770
to the global supersymmetry
on the field theory side.

00:24:15.510 --> 00:24:16.350
Yes?

00:24:16.350 --> 00:24:21.924
AUDIENCE: What are the fermions
supersymmetry on the AdS side?

00:24:21.924 --> 00:24:22.590
HONG LIU: Sorry?

00:24:22.590 --> 00:24:25.310
AUDIENCE: In the low energy
limit on the AdS part,

00:24:25.310 --> 00:24:29.260
what are the fermion
supersymmetry?

00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:32.700
HONG LIU: It's the same thing.

00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:34.450
What do you mean,
what about fermions?

00:24:34.450 --> 00:24:37.042
So there will be some fermions.

00:24:37.042 --> 00:24:39.018
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] fermions?

00:24:39.018 --> 00:24:42.480
So there is more than
gravitons on the AdS side

00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:43.820
involved in low energy limits?

00:24:43.820 --> 00:24:44.490
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:24:44.490 --> 00:24:46.910
There are gravitons, and
there are also some fermions.

00:24:46.910 --> 00:24:48.535
There's something
called a [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:48.535 --> 00:24:51.420
There are some other
fermions, et cetera.

00:24:51.420 --> 00:24:54.569
AUDIENCE: Is it they who
carry the u(1) gauge charge?

00:24:54.569 --> 00:24:55.110
HONG LIU: No.

00:24:55.110 --> 00:24:56.090
Here is more general.

00:24:58.890 --> 00:25:06.430
In this case, indeed--
so this isometry of S5,

00:25:06.430 --> 00:25:11.740
once you deduce to AdS5, that
just again becomes a gauge

00:25:11.740 --> 00:25:13.860
symmetry, SO(6) gauge symmetry.

00:25:13.860 --> 00:25:19.170
And some fermions indeed are
charged on this SO(6) gauge

00:25:19.170 --> 00:25:21.440
symmetry.

00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:23.540
And here, it's
just more general.

00:25:23.540 --> 00:25:27.540
So whatever things, anytime if
you have some global symmetry

00:25:27.540 --> 00:25:32.900
here should be mapped to
some gauge symmetry here.

00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:37.742
And we will say this a little
bit more a little bit later.

00:25:37.742 --> 00:25:39.075
Do you have any other questions?

00:25:41.730 --> 00:25:45.720
So now let's move to the
matching of parameters.

00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:51.850
Again, this is
more like a review

00:25:51.850 --> 00:25:53.070
of what we discussed before.

00:25:56.120 --> 00:26:02.780
And again, first N equals to
4 super Yang-Mills theory.

00:26:02.780 --> 00:26:06.780
And then this is type
IIB on AdS5 times S5.

00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:14.870
So previously we said, from
the relation of the d-brane,

00:26:14.870 --> 00:26:19.530
so the G Yang-Mills square
here is related to the 4 pi GS

00:26:19.530 --> 00:26:22.070
here, string coupling.

00:26:22.070 --> 00:26:25.780
And also, from the
d3-brane solution,

00:26:25.780 --> 00:26:29.310
we find is that the
G Yang-Mills square--

00:26:29.310 --> 00:26:33.290
we find, for example,
here the curvature radius

00:26:33.290 --> 00:26:41.090
R has the following form, 4
pi GS and alpha prime squared.

00:26:41.090 --> 00:26:45.810
So the N is the
same N on this side.

00:26:45.810 --> 00:26:54.000
So the N is the gauge group N.
I should say the flux N. Anyway,

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:57.140
let me add something.

00:26:57.140 --> 00:27:00.230
So the N is the number of
d-branes on this side which

00:27:00.230 --> 00:27:02.880
translate into the flux.

00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:06.050
So the flux N. And then
here is corresponding

00:27:06.050 --> 00:27:06.800
to you have SU(N).

00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:14.670
So this R, this
curvature radius is

00:27:14.670 --> 00:27:18.770
related to the alpha prime
squared and the gs in this way.

00:27:18.770 --> 00:27:25.760
And so on this side,
the dimension parameter

00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:28.680
is given by R squared
divided by alpha prime.

00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:32.800
So if you look at
this relation, if you

00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:35.960
look at alpha prime 4
to alpha prime squared,

00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:39.890
then you find this is
just relating the alpha.

00:27:39.890 --> 00:27:42.440
From this relation,
4 pi GS is equal just

00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:44.260
to G Yang-Mills square.

00:27:44.260 --> 00:27:47.622
And the N is N.
This is the relation

00:27:47.622 --> 00:27:48.580
between the parameters.

00:27:58.512 --> 00:27:59.720
Any questions regarding this?

00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:11.950
So on the gravity side, we said
these are the two parameters.

00:28:11.950 --> 00:28:14.410
And of course, you
also have this N.

00:28:14.410 --> 00:28:17.940
But these are the
two basic parameters.

00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:22.610
And we can also,
instead of using GS,

00:28:22.610 --> 00:28:26.190
as we said before, you can
also use the Newton constant.

00:28:26.190 --> 00:28:28.860
So the 10 dimensional
Newton constant

00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:31.510
is length dimension eight.

00:28:31.510 --> 00:28:35.950
Then the dimensionless parameter
would be GN divided by R

00:28:35.950 --> 00:28:36.875
to the power 8.

00:28:39.990 --> 00:28:44.529
And the GN is related to
the GS and alpha prime

00:28:44.529 --> 00:28:45.195
by this formula.

00:28:49.820 --> 00:28:53.105
So now you can just use
the relation between the GS

00:28:53.105 --> 00:28:57.550
to exactly translate this
into Yang-Mills coupling.

00:28:57.550 --> 00:29:00.140
You just can use this
relation and then use

00:29:00.140 --> 00:29:03.000
that to translate this into
the parameter in the Yang-Mills

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:04.620
theory side.

00:29:04.620 --> 00:29:08.340
Then you find, once you
plug all those relations in,

00:29:08.340 --> 00:29:11.890
how the GS and alpha prime,
et cetera related to N,

00:29:11.890 --> 00:29:15.360
then you find here
actually, G Yang-Mills

00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:17.750
have disappeared
in this relation.

00:29:17.750 --> 00:29:21.900
What you find is that the
Newton constant essentially just

00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:24.730
related to 1 over N squared.

00:29:24.730 --> 00:29:29.710
Up to some parameter, just
related to 1 over N squared.

00:29:29.710 --> 00:29:33.121
So if you're expanding G Newton,
just like expanding 1 over N

00:29:33.121 --> 00:29:33.621
squared.

00:29:39.540 --> 00:29:49.880
So as we said before, we often
do dimensional reduction on S5.

00:29:58.160 --> 00:30:01.720
Let me get a five
dimensional Newton constant.

00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:03.220
So five dimensional
Newton constant

00:30:03.220 --> 00:30:06.770
is equal to the 10
dimensional Newton constant.

00:30:06.770 --> 00:30:09.370
And the difference
is the volume of S5.

00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:20.440
We wrote this down before.

00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:29.350
And the S5 is equal to pi
cubed R to the power fifth.

00:30:29.350 --> 00:30:32.940
And then from here,
you can just work out.

00:30:32.940 --> 00:30:36.578
So G5 has dimension 3.

00:30:36.578 --> 00:30:41.930
Then G5 divided by R cubed,
again only related to N given

00:30:41.930 --> 00:30:43.540
by pi divided by 2N squared.

00:30:53.450 --> 00:30:55.730
So these relations are
often useful in the future.

00:31:12.060 --> 00:31:17.275
So now let's look at [INAUDIBLE]
limits of this relation.

00:31:21.660 --> 00:31:23.680
So let's first look at
the classical gravity

00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:24.950
limit on the gravity side.

00:31:37.601 --> 00:31:42.860
As we discussed at the beginning
of this class, by classic,

00:31:42.860 --> 00:31:47.870
we always use h bar equal to 1.

00:31:47.870 --> 00:31:49.913
So our h bar is
always equal to 1.

00:31:54.020 --> 00:31:57.850
But quantum gravity is
captured by this parameter,

00:31:57.850 --> 00:32:00.590
h bar times GN.

00:32:00.590 --> 00:32:04.250
So even though h bar equal
to 1, in the limit when

00:32:04.250 --> 00:32:07.240
GN goes to zero, then
you are in the regime

00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:10.330
in which you can ignore
the quantum gravity effect.

00:32:10.330 --> 00:32:13.950
So that's what we mean by
the classical gravity limit

00:32:13.950 --> 00:32:16.890
is that this should go to
zero, and then alpha prime

00:32:16.890 --> 00:32:19.410
should go to zero.

00:32:19.410 --> 00:32:22.450
So this means the string
effect is not important.

00:32:22.450 --> 00:32:28.120
And this is all
in the unit of R.

00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:30.630
And here, when I
write these relations,

00:32:30.630 --> 00:32:35.030
I have all set h bar equal to 1.

00:32:35.030 --> 00:32:37.130
So when I say the
classical gravity limit,

00:32:37.130 --> 00:32:40.590
which is this limit in
which h bar equal to 1,

00:32:40.590 --> 00:32:44.940
but the effect of the Newton
constant goes to zero.

00:32:44.940 --> 00:32:49.160
And the reason I emphasize it
is that if you have some matter

00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:55.330
field in this geometry, then
those matter fields should

00:32:55.330 --> 00:32:58.230
be treated as full quantum.

00:32:58.230 --> 00:33:01.712
Just don't treat the
gravity as quantum,

00:33:01.712 --> 00:33:04.420
but those matter fields
should be treated as quantum.

00:33:04.420 --> 00:33:05.830
So the classical
gravity limit is

00:33:05.830 --> 00:33:11.495
the same as QFT, Quantum Field
Theory in curved space time.

00:33:17.410 --> 00:33:19.250
So gravity does not fluctuate.

00:33:19.250 --> 00:33:22.180
So you have rigid
curved space time.

00:33:22.180 --> 00:33:26.840
But your matter field can
fluctuate, h bar equal to 1.

00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:30.110
So essentially, we are
dealing with quantum field

00:33:30.110 --> 00:33:32.410
theory in curved space time.

00:33:32.410 --> 00:33:38.430
So in the type
IIB super gravity,

00:33:38.430 --> 00:33:40.920
there are many, many such
kind of matter fields,

00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:44.560
and they all should be
treated quantum mechanically.

00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:51.940
It's just that you should
consider this small.

00:33:51.940 --> 00:33:55.300
So let's consider
what this means.

00:33:55.300 --> 00:34:01.140
So GN small as a
dimensionless parameter,

00:34:01.140 --> 00:34:06.540
this translates into
field theory side

00:34:06.540 --> 00:34:08.409
if we use this relation.

00:34:08.409 --> 00:34:11.130
So that means N
goes to infinity.

00:34:11.130 --> 00:34:14.475
So this is the large N limit
of the Yang-Mills theory.

00:34:14.475 --> 00:34:16.600
This is the large N limit
of the Yang-Mills theory.

00:34:19.179 --> 00:34:20.783
And then alpha
prime goes to zero.

00:34:25.170 --> 00:34:29.620
From the relation between
the alpha prime and here,

00:34:29.620 --> 00:34:33.819
when alpha prime goes to zero,
so this is in the downstairs.

00:34:33.819 --> 00:34:35.610
Then that means this
should go to infinity.

00:34:38.190 --> 00:34:43.020
So this is the t Hooft
coupling we defined before.

00:34:43.020 --> 00:34:45.390
So this means the t Hooft
coupling goes to infinity.

00:34:52.909 --> 00:34:54.677
So now we see a
remarkable relation.

00:35:04.690 --> 00:35:08.490
So this is what we expect.

00:35:08.490 --> 00:35:12.080
If you still remember what we
did before in the large N gauge

00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:15.600
theory, in the large N gauge
theory in the large N limit,

00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:18.100
the fluctuations become
very small, et cetera.

00:35:18.100 --> 00:35:21.160
So this is consistent
that on the gravity side,

00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:25.990
the fluctuation in the
geometry is very small.

00:35:25.990 --> 00:35:33.890
And now, we see that the
decoupling of the string effect

00:35:33.890 --> 00:35:38.530
requires on the field theory
side the strong coupling.

00:35:38.530 --> 00:35:42.410
This is also something
roughly we said before.

00:35:42.410 --> 00:35:49.710
Remember, when we talked
about large N gauge theory,

00:35:49.710 --> 00:35:51.640
large N gauge theory,
you have planar diagram,

00:35:51.640 --> 00:35:55.040
non-planar diagram, et cetera.

00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:57.930
And at each level, say
at the planar diagram,

00:35:57.930 --> 00:36:01.380
you need to sum over infinite
number of [INAUDIBLE] diagrams

00:36:01.380 --> 00:36:04.499
which are all planar topology.

00:36:04.499 --> 00:36:07.040
And if you look at just those
[INAUDIBLE] diagrams, of course

00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:11.009
you don't see a space
time interpretation

00:36:11.009 --> 00:36:12.800
because they are just
[INAUDIBLE] diagrams.

00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:16.080
You don't see a
continuous surface.

00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:20.080
And I already alluded before
that the continuous surface

00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:23.089
can emerge if that
diagram becomes

00:36:23.089 --> 00:36:24.130
sufficiently complicated.

00:36:26.936 --> 00:36:29.310
And the way to make that
diagram sufficiently complicated

00:36:29.310 --> 00:36:32.330
is to make it to be
a strong coupling.

00:36:32.330 --> 00:36:34.910
The strong coupling,
then the diagram

00:36:34.910 --> 00:36:37.670
with many, many
vertices will dominate.

00:36:37.670 --> 00:36:40.470
And then the most dominated
diagrams are those diagrams

00:36:40.470 --> 00:36:42.000
with not a lot of vertices.

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:45.600
And they essentially are
going to continue to limits.

00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:50.070
And so this relation
[INAUDIBLE] realizes

00:36:50.070 --> 00:36:52.380
that kind of intuition.

00:36:52.380 --> 00:36:56.230
If you don't remember, go
back to your loads regarding

00:36:56.230 --> 00:36:57.280
the large N gauge theory.

00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:04.140
So this relation
is also remarkable

00:37:04.140 --> 00:37:07.350
for the following reason.

00:37:07.350 --> 00:37:09.620
Because this limit on the
gravity side is simple,

00:37:09.620 --> 00:37:12.540
we can just deal
with quantum field

00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:16.610
theory in the curved space
time, which we know how to do.

00:37:16.610 --> 00:37:18.640
But on this side, it's
highly non-trivial

00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:21.030
because this is an
infinite coupling limit.

00:37:21.030 --> 00:37:31.860
So this will tell you that
the strong coupling limit is

00:37:31.860 --> 00:37:40.354
described by classical gravity.

00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:56.340
So that means that we can
actually use classical gravity

00:37:56.340 --> 00:37:59.404
to, in principle, solve problems
which are strongly coupled.

00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:10.470
So also, of course, there
are corrections beyond this.

00:38:13.710 --> 00:38:24.610
So quantum gravity
corrections on this side,

00:38:24.610 --> 00:38:26.760
so this is a classical
gravity limit

00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:29.400
if you take those
parameters to go to zero.

00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:32.620
But suppose those parameters
are not zero, just small.

00:38:32.620 --> 00:38:35.110
Then you can just expand
in those parameters.

00:38:35.110 --> 00:38:39.540
For example, can you
expand in GN divided by 8.

00:38:39.540 --> 00:38:42.760
And that expansion essentially
gives you quantum gravity

00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:45.600
corrections [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:51.055
And now, from this relation,
the expansion of GN

00:38:51.055 --> 00:38:53.290
then is translated.

00:38:53.290 --> 00:39:00.470
So this is expansion
in G Newton.

00:39:00.470 --> 00:39:02.390
So from that
relation, we see this

00:39:02.390 --> 00:39:07.170
has become the expansion 1 over
N squared in the field theory

00:39:07.170 --> 00:39:07.670
side.

00:39:14.830 --> 00:39:24.096
Just expansion 1 over N squared.

00:39:29.850 --> 00:39:33.500
So on this side, you can
also take into account

00:39:33.500 --> 00:39:36.780
that the alpha
prime is non-zero.

00:39:36.780 --> 00:39:41.030
Then the alpha prime
corrections in the expansion

00:39:41.030 --> 00:39:41.735
in alpha prime.

00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:50.180
So from this relation,
translates in the expansion 1

00:39:50.180 --> 00:39:51.180
over square root lambda.

00:39:57.280 --> 00:40:03.321
So in principle, the
corrections beyond this limit

00:40:03.321 --> 00:40:07.220
can again be studied
on the gravity side.

00:40:07.220 --> 00:40:09.400
And then the 1 over square
root lambda corrections

00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:12.510
then corresponding to
the string G corrections.

00:40:12.510 --> 00:40:14.802
And the 1 over N squared
corrections corresponding

00:40:14.802 --> 00:40:16.260
to the quantum
gravity corrections.

00:40:23.680 --> 00:40:24.980
So this is the classical limit.

00:40:24.980 --> 00:40:26.780
You also can see
the classical string

00:40:26.780 --> 00:40:32.050
limit we considered before,
we discussed before.

00:40:32.050 --> 00:40:34.640
In the classical
string limit, still you

00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:40.450
can see the N go to infinity,
which corresponds to GN.

00:40:40.450 --> 00:40:43.240
R8 goes to 0.

00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:46.156
But here, the alpha
prime can be arbitrary.

00:40:51.900 --> 00:40:56.980
And here the [INAUDIBLE]
coupling can be arbitrary.

00:40:56.980 --> 00:40:58.160
So it can be finite.

00:40:58.160 --> 00:41:03.490
So let me just say alpha
prime finite no longer zero.

00:41:03.490 --> 00:41:06.950
And then this is just
corresponding to lambda finite,

00:41:06.950 --> 00:41:11.140
which is no longer infinite.

00:41:11.140 --> 00:41:16.980
So this is just a
standard t Hooft limit,

00:41:16.980 --> 00:41:22.370
which we take N go to infinity
but keep lambda to be finite.

00:41:22.370 --> 00:41:25.530
Standard t Hooft limit,
which we talked about before

00:41:25.530 --> 00:41:28.930
in the large N gauge theory.

00:41:28.930 --> 00:41:30.669
And then again, the
corrections in GN

00:41:30.669 --> 00:41:32.335
will be corrections
in 1 over N squared.

00:41:43.690 --> 00:41:44.840
So any questions?

00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:45.410
Yes?

00:41:45.410 --> 00:41:50.479
AUDIENCE: Doesn't small alpha
over R squared mean large GS?

00:41:50.479 --> 00:41:51.020
HONG LIU: No.

00:41:51.020 --> 00:41:52.311
That has nothing to do with GS.

00:41:55.261 --> 00:41:56.802
These are two
independent parameters.

00:42:00.536 --> 00:42:05.619
AUDIENCE: But expression
parentheses, so there's also N.

00:42:05.619 --> 00:42:06.410
HONG LIU: This is--

00:42:13.100 --> 00:42:15.100
AUDIENCE: So in the
classical [INAUDIBLE],

00:42:15.100 --> 00:42:18.565
it means that since
lambda is finite,

00:42:18.565 --> 00:42:22.520
so this means G Yang-Mills is 0.

00:42:22.520 --> 00:42:23.250
HONG LIU: Sorry.

00:42:23.250 --> 00:42:27.750
AUDIENCE: I mean lambda is
finite, so G Yang-Mills is 0

00:42:27.750 --> 00:42:29.310
and it means weak coupling.

00:42:29.310 --> 00:42:30.950
HONG LIU: No.

00:42:30.950 --> 00:42:38.490
That's what we discussed before
in the large N gauge theory.

00:42:38.490 --> 00:42:42.220
The effective
coupling is lambda.

00:42:42.220 --> 00:42:50.030
Lambda is your effective
coupling in the large N limit.

00:42:50.030 --> 00:42:53.030
AUDIENCE: When you draw
the diagram, [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:53.030 --> 00:42:53.950
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:42:53.950 --> 00:42:56.775
So the lambda is your coupling.

00:42:56.775 --> 00:43:01.280
The G Yang-Mills indeed,
in the t Hooft limit,

00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:05.050
the G Yang-Mills will go to
0 when N goes to infinity.

00:43:05.050 --> 00:43:09.680
But G Yang-Mills is
not the right parameter

00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:10.564
to look at things.

00:43:16.652 --> 00:43:17.485
Any other questions?

00:43:21.120 --> 00:43:22.470
OK, good.

00:43:22.470 --> 00:43:25.187
So now we can move on further.

00:43:39.190 --> 00:43:49.352
We can talk about the matching
of the spectrum on two sides.

00:43:54.920 --> 00:43:59.800
So from now on, I will just
restrict to essentially

00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:01.760
the semi classical.

00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:06.940
Here I should call semi
classical gravity limit

00:44:06.940 --> 00:44:10.120
because we still treat the
matter fields essentially

00:44:10.120 --> 00:44:10.690
as quantum.

00:44:10.690 --> 00:44:15.680
So we call it semi
classical gravity limit.

00:44:15.680 --> 00:44:18.100
So from now on,
so we will mostly

00:44:18.100 --> 00:44:20.590
just consider the
semi classical gravity

00:44:20.590 --> 00:44:23.580
regime in the gravity side.

00:44:23.580 --> 00:44:26.240
Because essentially,
we know very little

00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:31.090
about the string theory
in this geometry.

00:44:34.300 --> 00:44:38.580
And also, I will
often use the phrase

00:44:38.580 --> 00:44:41.170
which applies to the
general correspondence,

00:44:41.170 --> 00:44:44.750
and not necessarily just N equal
to 4 super Yang-Mills theory

00:44:44.750 --> 00:44:48.504
and the type IIB string theory.

00:44:48.504 --> 00:44:50.170
I just use the language
assuming there's

00:44:50.170 --> 00:44:53.690
a general correspondence between
some conformal field theory

00:44:53.690 --> 00:44:55.415
and some AdS gravity theory.

00:45:02.570 --> 00:45:06.320
So if the two theories
have to be the same,

00:45:06.320 --> 00:45:08.770
two sides have to
be the same, then

00:45:08.770 --> 00:45:10.962
you should be able to
map their spectrum.

00:45:10.962 --> 00:45:13.170
So you should be able to
map their [INAUDIBLE] space,

00:45:13.170 --> 00:45:13.731
for example.

00:45:17.310 --> 00:45:22.180
So again, [INAUDIBLE] now
use the general language

00:45:22.180 --> 00:45:24.032
of the boundary and
the [INAUDIBLE].

00:45:46.130 --> 00:45:50.220
So the boundary theory
is a conformal theory

00:45:50.220 --> 00:45:51.648
with this symmetry.

00:45:54.550 --> 00:45:58.270
So for the moment, I don't
have [INAUDIBLE] symmetry.

00:45:58.270 --> 00:46:08.900
So that means that [INAUDIBLE]
space should be organized

00:46:08.900 --> 00:46:21.436
as the representations
of the conformal group,

00:46:21.436 --> 00:46:22.310
say of this SO(d, 2).

00:46:27.380 --> 00:46:31.800
And similarly here,
because here, the SO(d,

00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:37.400
2) is the isometry group which
lives in infinite invariants.

00:46:37.400 --> 00:46:41.490
And again, you should be able to
organize your [INAUDIBLE] space

00:46:41.490 --> 00:46:45.940
using the representations
of the SO(d, 2).

00:46:45.940 --> 00:46:50.020
And those representations, of
course, should be the same.

00:46:50.020 --> 00:46:52.150
So if there's one
representation here,

00:46:52.150 --> 00:46:54.360
then there must be a
[INAUDIBLE] representation here.

00:46:54.360 --> 00:46:57.400
And if there's two [INAUDIBLE]
representations here,

00:46:57.400 --> 00:47:00.920
there would be two identical
representations here.

00:47:00.920 --> 00:47:03.550
The representations must match.

00:47:03.550 --> 00:47:13.690
And on the boundary
side, the local operators

00:47:13.690 --> 00:47:16.120
should also transform
on the representations

00:47:16.120 --> 00:47:18.660
of the conformal symmetry.

00:47:18.660 --> 00:47:29.920
And again, they conform
local operators can also

00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:34.980
be mapped to, say, the
field on the gravity side.

00:47:34.980 --> 00:47:46.052
So on the gravity side, the
fields should also transform

00:47:46.052 --> 00:47:50.510
under this SO(d, 2) isometry.

00:47:50.510 --> 00:47:52.590
That means that it
should be a one to one

00:47:52.590 --> 00:47:56.290
correspondence between
the local operators here

00:47:56.290 --> 00:48:00.800
and the bulk fields
on the gravity side.

00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:04.570
There should be a one to one
correspondence on this side.

00:48:04.570 --> 00:48:13.540
For example, in the boundary, if
there is some scalar operator,

00:48:13.540 --> 00:48:15.850
there must be a
corresponding scalar

00:48:15.850 --> 00:48:17.348
field on the gravity side.

00:48:21.820 --> 00:48:25.940
Similarly, if there is some
vector operator in the boundary

00:48:25.940 --> 00:48:30.430
theory, there must be a
corresponding bulk vector

00:48:30.430 --> 00:48:34.190
field in the gravity side.

00:48:34.190 --> 00:48:37.730
And similarly, if you have
some symmetric tensor,

00:48:37.730 --> 00:48:42.000
then this must also be related
to some symmetric tensor.

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:44.470
So now I will often use the
notation that I've used.

00:48:44.470 --> 00:48:47.820
Mu mu refers to the
boundary indices.

00:48:47.820 --> 00:48:53.080
And the capital M, capital N
refers to the bulk indices.

00:48:53.080 --> 00:48:55.980
Because they are on
different dimensions.

00:48:55.980 --> 00:48:58.165
So then they are
not quite the same.

00:49:00.709 --> 00:49:01.875
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:49:01.875 --> 00:49:03.510
HONG LIU: One second.

00:49:03.510 --> 00:49:05.440
Let me just finish.

00:49:05.440 --> 00:49:08.780
So here, I'm just talking
about the conformal symmetries.

00:49:08.780 --> 00:49:11.890
And if the theory has
some other symmetries,

00:49:11.890 --> 00:49:18.530
say some global symmetries or
supersymmetries, then again,

00:49:18.530 --> 00:49:21.330
all those fields
and the state, they

00:49:21.330 --> 00:49:23.760
should transform on
the representations

00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:24.820
of those symmetries.

00:49:24.820 --> 00:49:27.600
And again, they should
all match together.

00:49:27.600 --> 00:49:30.240
They should all match together.

00:49:30.240 --> 00:49:31.230
Yes?

00:49:31.230 --> 00:49:40.430
AUDIENCE: So we proved that the
super Yang-Mills theory really

00:49:40.430 --> 00:49:42.729
lives on the
boundary of the AdS?

00:49:42.729 --> 00:49:43.270
HONG LIU: No.

00:49:43.270 --> 00:49:44.910
We did not prove that.

00:49:44.910 --> 00:49:46.010
This is just a postulate.

00:49:50.580 --> 00:49:54.087
First, let me just repeat again.

00:49:56.950 --> 00:50:01.350
Yang-Mills theory lives
on Minkowski space.

00:50:01.350 --> 00:50:05.160
And it's just an observation
that the Minkowski space

00:50:05.160 --> 00:50:08.010
is the boundary of AdS.

00:50:08.010 --> 00:50:13.530
And then you say you can imagine
that this is the boundary,

00:50:13.530 --> 00:50:16.700
this relation is related to
the bulk and the boundary.

00:50:16.700 --> 00:50:18.916
And this is a postulate
based on that fact.

00:50:23.055 --> 00:50:23.554
Yes?

00:50:26.220 --> 00:50:29.354
AUDIENCE: I thought one of
the motivations for thinking

00:50:29.354 --> 00:50:31.020
about the holographic
duality was to try

00:50:31.020 --> 00:50:32.860
to escape [INAUDIBLE] theorem.

00:50:35.596 --> 00:50:37.910
And all of a sudden,
it strikes me,

00:50:37.910 --> 00:50:42.544
so we're trying to get
on the boundary spin

00:50:42.544 --> 00:50:43.460
to massless particles.

00:50:46.360 --> 00:50:49.015
Then they will also
exist in the bulk.

00:50:49.015 --> 00:50:49.681
HONG LIU: Sorry.

00:50:51.875 --> 00:50:53.250
In the field theory
side, there's

00:50:53.250 --> 00:50:54.644
no massless spin to particles.

00:50:57.490 --> 00:50:59.740
They map to some field in
the gravity side in the five

00:50:59.740 --> 00:51:00.850
dimensions.

00:51:00.850 --> 00:51:03.990
So this is some four
dimensional operator.

00:51:03.990 --> 00:51:06.913
Then this maps to some
five dimensional fields.

00:51:06.913 --> 00:51:09.680
AUDIENCE: I need to think
about my question better.

00:51:13.520 --> 00:51:14.172
HONG LIU: Yes?

00:51:14.172 --> 00:51:16.130
AUDIENCE: So if it's a
postulate that-- I mean,

00:51:16.130 --> 00:51:20.797
it's not required that the
theory live on the boundary.

00:51:20.797 --> 00:51:23.380
It seems that that's just sort
of a convenient way of thinking

00:51:23.380 --> 00:51:24.070
about it.

00:51:24.070 --> 00:51:26.784
But what implications would
it have if it actually

00:51:26.784 --> 00:51:27.700
lived on the boundary?

00:51:27.700 --> 00:51:29.360
Would it change anything?

00:51:29.360 --> 00:51:31.650
HONG LIU: That's
what I said before.

00:51:31.650 --> 00:51:35.890
So this discussion does
not depend on that.

00:51:35.890 --> 00:51:39.190
This discussion does
not depend on that.

00:51:39.190 --> 00:51:42.410
You can say I don't need to
worry about that whether this

00:51:42.410 --> 00:51:44.790
is on the boundary
or bulk, et cetera.

00:51:44.790 --> 00:51:46.950
These are just some
different theories.

00:51:46.950 --> 00:51:48.229
I want them to be the same.

00:51:48.229 --> 00:51:48.895
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:51:48.895 --> 00:51:50.200
OK.

00:51:50.200 --> 00:51:53.840
HONG LIU: But, as I said last
time, if you believe this bulk

00:51:53.840 --> 00:51:58.370
and boundary relation,
then this is powerful

00:51:58.370 --> 00:52:00.220
because then, you
can immediately

00:52:00.220 --> 00:52:06.710
deduce that the Yang-Mills
theory on the S3 times time

00:52:06.710 --> 00:52:10.760
then is related to the gravity
theory in the global AdS.

00:52:10.760 --> 00:52:14.090
And that is a
nontrivial prediction

00:52:14.090 --> 00:52:18.090
from thinking the boundary
and the bulk relation.

00:52:18.090 --> 00:52:21.960
Now you can generalize it.

00:52:21.960 --> 00:52:23.780
Because if I just
look at this relation,

00:52:23.780 --> 00:52:27.630
I have no reason to suspect why.

00:52:27.630 --> 00:52:30.460
You can argue from the
symmetry point of view also,

00:52:30.460 --> 00:52:33.270
but that language
is more direct.

00:52:40.484 --> 00:52:44.820
In principle, after
establishing the relation

00:52:44.820 --> 00:52:47.530
between the Yang-Mills theory
in Minkowski space time

00:52:47.530 --> 00:52:51.940
and this gravity in
the Poincare patch,

00:52:51.940 --> 00:52:56.380
I may also, just based on
the group theory aspect,

00:52:56.380 --> 00:53:01.540
to say that should generalize
to the Yang-Mills theory

00:53:01.540 --> 00:53:04.920
on the S sphere
and the global AdS.

00:53:04.920 --> 00:53:07.620
You may also be able
to do it that way.

00:53:07.620 --> 00:53:10.140
But thinking from the
holographic point of view

00:53:10.140 --> 00:53:14.580
will give you a direct
way to argue that,

00:53:14.580 --> 00:53:17.035
give you an alternative
way to argue that.

00:53:20.320 --> 00:53:24.080
Also, in your p-set, you have
checked this holographic bound.

00:53:24.080 --> 00:53:27.230
And so that's a
confirmation of this.

00:53:27.230 --> 00:53:27.870
Yes?

00:53:27.870 --> 00:53:29.630
AUDIENCE: So what does the
massless [INAUDIBLE] field

00:53:29.630 --> 00:53:32.255
on the right map to if it's the
same representation of SO(d,

00:53:32.255 --> 00:53:33.824
2)?

00:53:33.824 --> 00:53:34.490
HONG LIU: Sorry.

00:53:34.490 --> 00:53:35.320
Say it again.

00:53:35.320 --> 00:53:38.372
AUDIENCE: So in the
representation line,

00:53:38.372 --> 00:53:40.830
so if you have the massless
[INAUDIBLE] field on the right,

00:53:40.830 --> 00:53:43.185
what does it map to on the left?

00:53:43.185 --> 00:53:43.810
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:53:43.810 --> 00:53:45.510
We are going to talk about it.

00:53:45.510 --> 00:53:46.837
We are going to talk about it.

00:53:57.056 --> 00:53:58.430
So if there are
other symmetries,

00:53:58.430 --> 00:54:01.260
then everything should match.

00:54:01.260 --> 00:54:04.590
So now, as an
immediate check, you

00:54:04.590 --> 00:54:09.180
can now just open
your old papers.

00:54:09.180 --> 00:54:12.670
And if you load them--
because in the '80s,

00:54:12.670 --> 00:54:16.520
people have worked out
the supergravity spectrum

00:54:16.520 --> 00:54:20.110
precisely on this space.

00:54:20.110 --> 00:54:25.530
So even though this relation
was discovered in '97, actually

00:54:25.530 --> 00:54:28.730
in the '80s, people
already worked a lot

00:54:28.730 --> 00:54:32.170
to consider this type to be
supergravity on this space.

00:54:32.170 --> 00:54:34.320
Because this is a maximally
supersymmetric space,

00:54:34.320 --> 00:54:35.170
et cetera.

00:54:35.170 --> 00:54:39.955
Anyway, so people have
already spent lots of trouble

00:54:39.955 --> 00:54:42.920
to actually work
out that spectrum.

00:54:42.920 --> 00:54:46.010
And now you can just
open their paper.

00:54:46.010 --> 00:54:50.110
Then there's a big table
about the different fields

00:54:50.110 --> 00:54:52.630
and their representations,
et cetera.

00:54:52.630 --> 00:54:55.710
And then you can immediately
see they actually

00:54:55.710 --> 00:55:02.550
map to certain representation
of operators on the N equal to 4

00:55:02.550 --> 00:55:03.550
super Yang-Mills theory.

00:55:03.550 --> 00:55:05.049
Then you can
immediately check them.

00:55:07.540 --> 00:55:12.077
Just based on the group
theory, check them.

00:55:15.080 --> 00:55:16.980
So I won't go through
those details.

00:55:16.980 --> 00:55:28.670
But let me just mention the most
important such kind of mapping

00:55:28.670 --> 00:55:30.300
for these two theories.

00:55:30.300 --> 00:55:33.930
And actually does
have consequences

00:55:33.930 --> 00:55:39.140
for the general story.

00:55:42.070 --> 00:55:50.730
So the most important mapping.

00:55:50.730 --> 00:55:52.460
So as we said, on the
string theory side,

00:55:52.460 --> 00:55:53.668
you always have this dilaton.

00:55:56.010 --> 00:55:58.920
So these is some scalar field.

00:55:58.920 --> 00:56:02.740
And this dilaton will appear
in the scalar field, in AdS5,

00:56:02.740 --> 00:56:05.260
say, for example.

00:56:05.260 --> 00:56:06.870
And it turns out
this dilaton field

00:56:06.870 --> 00:56:09.470
is mapped to the Lagrangian
of the N equal to 4

00:56:09.470 --> 00:56:10.470
super Yang-Mills theory.

00:56:19.510 --> 00:56:22.120
So the Lagrangian
is a Lagrangian

00:56:22.120 --> 00:56:24.140
of the N equals to 4
super Yang-Mills theory,

00:56:24.140 --> 00:56:27.670
say, trace f squared plus
phi squared, et cetera.

00:56:27.670 --> 00:56:29.566
So that's a local operator.

00:56:29.566 --> 00:56:31.940
And it turns out that operator
is mapped to this dilaton.

00:56:35.812 --> 00:56:38.020
And on the N equal to 4
super Yang-Mills theory side,

00:56:38.020 --> 00:56:40.870
we have this SO6 gauge symmetry.

00:56:40.870 --> 00:56:43.740
Did I just erase them?

00:56:43.740 --> 00:56:46.130
We have this SO6 gauge symmetry.

00:56:46.130 --> 00:56:53.989
Then we have the SO6
conserved current.

00:56:53.989 --> 00:56:55.780
And it turns out this,
on the gravity side,

00:56:55.780 --> 00:57:00.310
just maps to sO6 gauge field.

00:57:00.310 --> 00:57:02.841
AUDIENCE: You said it was
an SO6 gauge symmetry?

00:57:02.841 --> 00:57:03.382
HONG LIU: No.

00:57:03.382 --> 00:57:06.790
In the N equal to 4, this
is a global symmetry.

00:57:06.790 --> 00:57:12.060
But on this side, so this
appears as isometry on the S5.

00:57:12.060 --> 00:57:16.790
But when you dimensionally
reduce on S5, then in AdS5,

00:57:16.790 --> 00:57:18.610
then there will be
a pure gauge field

00:57:18.610 --> 00:57:23.890
corresponding to each symmetry
generated [INAUDIBLE] S5.

00:57:23.890 --> 00:57:28.390
And that naturally maps
to this conserved current

00:57:28.390 --> 00:57:31.700
on the field theory side.

00:57:31.700 --> 00:57:35.000
And then another universal
operator on the field theory

00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:36.787
side is the stress tensor.

00:57:36.787 --> 00:57:38.370
So no matter what
theory you consider,

00:57:38.370 --> 00:57:39.590
you have stress tensor.

00:57:44.010 --> 00:57:47.715
And this is mapped
to-- turns out,

00:57:47.715 --> 00:57:48.881
to the metric perturbations.

00:57:57.140 --> 00:57:59.051
It's a deviation
from the AdS metric.

00:58:04.910 --> 00:58:11.080
Again, so at the representation
level, this is very natural.

00:58:11.080 --> 00:58:12.330
So this is a symmetric tensor.

00:58:12.330 --> 00:58:13.462
This is a symmetric tensor.

00:58:15.970 --> 00:58:18.649
But physically, this
is also natural.

00:58:18.649 --> 00:58:19.690
Physically, also natural.

00:58:19.690 --> 00:58:25.190
I will elaborate this
a little bit further

00:58:25.190 --> 00:58:32.460
from a different perspective
in a few minutes.

00:58:37.442 --> 00:58:39.275
So do you have any
questions regarding this?

00:58:45.590 --> 00:58:48.810
So now, given this
mapping, any operator

00:58:48.810 --> 00:58:51.570
is due to a bulk field.

00:58:51.570 --> 00:58:55.360
Then you can ask some
immediate questions.

00:58:55.360 --> 00:59:01.510
For example, the quantum
numbers of these operators

00:59:01.510 --> 00:59:04.290
will map to the quantum
numbers of the bulk fields.

00:59:04.290 --> 00:59:09.160
And that's something I said
you can check their symmetries.

00:59:09.160 --> 00:59:12.950
For example, not only
the representations

00:59:12.950 --> 00:59:14.450
under this conformal
symmetry should

00:59:14.450 --> 00:59:16.690
map under that representation.

00:59:16.690 --> 00:59:22.860
And also, the
representation under that

00:59:22.860 --> 00:59:24.430
SO6 we also match, et cetera.

00:59:28.700 --> 00:59:34.161
So for local operator on
the field theory side,

00:59:34.161 --> 00:59:36.160
so once we have this
mapping, we can immediately

00:59:36.160 --> 00:59:42.580
ask questions related to
operators on this side,

00:59:42.580 --> 00:59:45.250
and try to ask what's the
counterpart on the other side.

00:59:45.250 --> 00:59:49.510
And ask the story about the
field on the gravity side,

00:59:49.510 --> 00:59:51.320
and ask what's
happened on this side.

00:59:51.320 --> 00:59:55.610
We can start developing
the relations.

00:59:55.610 --> 00:59:59.120
So now let's start
discussing them.

00:59:59.120 --> 01:00:02.270
So the first thing you can
do, so immediate question

01:00:02.270 --> 01:00:08.710
you can ask is that
given the operator,

01:00:08.710 --> 01:00:14.370
say operator O in
the field theory.

01:00:21.912 --> 01:00:23.370
So there are some
natural questions

01:00:23.370 --> 01:00:25.250
one can raise about
this operator.

01:00:25.250 --> 01:00:28.360
For example, what is correlation
functions, et cetera?

01:00:28.360 --> 01:00:30.000
And that we will
discuss a bit later.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:34.940
But now let me discuss
another natural question.

01:00:34.940 --> 01:01:00.270
And the natural thing to do is
to deform your original theory

01:01:00.270 --> 01:01:05.040
by adding this operator
to the Lagrangian.

01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:17.210
So I have an operator.

01:01:17.210 --> 01:01:18.240
I can put the source.

01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:19.870
I can put the coefficients.

01:01:19.870 --> 01:01:22.090
And these coefficients
may depend or not

01:01:22.090 --> 01:01:25.010
depend on the space
time coordinates.

01:01:25.010 --> 01:01:28.060
And I can always add such
a term to a Lagrangian.

01:01:28.060 --> 01:01:31.140
And then this deforms my theory
away from the original theory.

01:01:31.140 --> 01:01:32.990
So this is a
natural thing to do.

01:01:32.990 --> 01:01:34.902
And this phi 0 is often
called the source.

01:01:42.510 --> 01:01:44.076
So this phi 0 is
called the source.

01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:57.970
So immediate question
you can ask--

01:01:57.970 --> 01:02:05.430
and when phi 0 is
equal to constant,

01:02:05.430 --> 01:02:18.280
then this corresponding to
a change in the coupling

01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:20.050
for this operator.

01:02:24.760 --> 01:02:29.660
So if your Lagrangian previously
already included this operator,

01:02:29.660 --> 01:02:32.770
and then if you add such a term,
so phi 0 equal to constant,

01:02:32.770 --> 01:02:35.990
then you are just changing the
coupling for that operator.

01:02:35.990 --> 01:02:38.230
And if this operator
is not there,

01:02:38.230 --> 01:02:42.337
then you just add
the new coupling.

01:02:42.337 --> 01:02:44.545
But in general, you can make
it space time dependent.

01:02:49.570 --> 01:02:51.470
AUDIENCE: Why is it
coupling since there's

01:02:51.470 --> 01:02:55.180
no other operators
coupling without if we

01:02:55.180 --> 01:02:57.829
say phi 0 is a constant?

01:02:57.829 --> 01:02:58.495
HONG LIU: Sorry?

01:02:58.495 --> 01:03:00.000
AUDIENCE: If phi
0 is a constant?

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:00.200
HONG LIU: No.

01:03:00.200 --> 01:03:01.090
O is the operator.

01:03:01.090 --> 01:03:02.358
It's the local operator.

01:03:02.358 --> 01:03:06.820
AUDIENCE: Yes, but there
is no other operator

01:03:06.820 --> 01:03:09.920
this operator O coupling with.

01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:12.350
HONG LIU: No, no, no.

01:03:12.350 --> 01:03:14.410
What is the meaning of operator?

01:03:14.410 --> 01:03:20.980
The meaning of
operator is that O is

01:03:20.980 --> 01:03:24.630
a sum of the product of fields.

01:03:24.630 --> 01:03:28.010
And so there's already--
so this O may be phi cubed,

01:03:28.010 --> 01:03:29.360
or may be phi 4, et cetera.

01:03:34.520 --> 01:03:37.610
So example is O in the
scalar field theory.

01:03:42.040 --> 01:03:45.610
If a scalar field theory
has a gauge field,

01:03:45.610 --> 01:03:49.000
then I can write O
as trace F squared.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:52.080
Then this corresponding
to changing the coupling

01:03:52.080 --> 01:03:53.780
for trace F squared.

01:03:59.010 --> 01:04:01.674
So immediate question is,
what does this operation-- so

01:04:01.674 --> 01:04:03.090
in the field theory
point of view,

01:04:03.090 --> 01:04:05.489
you can always do
this operation.

01:04:05.489 --> 01:04:07.780
So the immediate question,
what does this corresponding

01:04:07.780 --> 01:04:08.524
to in the bulk?

01:04:13.610 --> 01:04:27.985
What does this operation
correspond to in the bulk?

01:04:36.080 --> 01:04:39.800
So now I'll try to
answer this question.

01:04:39.800 --> 01:04:45.250
As I said before, in
establishing such dictionary,

01:04:45.250 --> 01:04:49.380
you often have to do lots of
guesswork, and then you check.

01:04:49.380 --> 01:04:55.870
And the guesswork is based
on some very small clues.

01:04:55.870 --> 01:05:00.120
So people who are able
to make good guesses

01:05:00.120 --> 01:05:04.790
is that they are able to grasp
important clues sometimes

01:05:04.790 --> 01:05:05.885
from very simple facts.

01:05:08.750 --> 01:05:11.150
And so that is what's
good physicists do

01:05:11.150 --> 01:05:14.230
is that they can see
non-ordinary things

01:05:14.230 --> 01:05:16.530
from ordinary things.

01:05:16.530 --> 01:05:27.156
So here, I will try to deduce
the answer to this question

01:05:27.156 --> 01:05:28.447
by starting from this relation.

01:05:35.330 --> 01:05:37.281
So let me start
with that relation.

01:05:46.520 --> 01:05:49.520
Related to the GS.

01:05:49.520 --> 01:05:52.940
Let's forget about p for pi.

01:05:52.940 --> 01:05:56.890
And now, we've talked about
before GS string coupling can

01:05:56.890 --> 01:06:01.310
be considered as the expectation
value of the dilaton field.

01:06:01.310 --> 01:06:02.858
Let me actually
call it capital Phi.

01:06:07.140 --> 01:06:09.694
So we mentioned before when
we talked about string theory

01:06:09.694 --> 01:06:12.110
that this string coupling can
be considered as expectation

01:06:12.110 --> 01:06:15.278
value of the dilaton field.

01:06:19.904 --> 01:06:21.570
Of course in general,
again, the dilaton

01:06:21.570 --> 01:06:22.611
can fluctuate, et cetera.

01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:27.300
So normally, in
flat space, when we

01:06:27.300 --> 01:06:31.950
say the dilaton has expectation
value, what we normally

01:06:31.950 --> 01:06:35.760
say is that the value of
the dilaton at infinity

01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:40.340
because the boundary by
infinity, that's how you fix.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:51.160
And similarly, for space time
like AdS with a boundary,

01:06:51.160 --> 01:06:55.300
and the expectation
value of this dilaton

01:06:55.300 --> 01:06:58.620
can be identified with
the value of the dilaton

01:06:58.620 --> 01:07:00.310
at the boundary of AdS.

01:07:03.010 --> 01:07:06.345
So here, I write partial AdS
means the boundary of AdS.

01:07:10.100 --> 01:07:14.816
So this is the value of AdS,
value of phi at the boundary.

01:07:22.650 --> 01:07:24.585
So expectation value
essentially can

01:07:24.585 --> 01:07:26.710
be associated with the
boundary value of the field.

01:07:29.900 --> 01:07:32.410
AUDIENCE: You mean
if it is a constant?

01:07:32.410 --> 01:07:36.490
You mean if expectation
value of the phi is constant?

01:07:36.490 --> 01:07:40.778
Or if it's, function-wise,
equal to the boundary limit?

01:07:40.778 --> 01:07:42.210
HONG LIU: No, no, no.

01:07:42.210 --> 01:07:43.990
Think about the following thing.

01:07:43.990 --> 01:07:49.340
As I said, phi in
principle can fluctuate.

01:07:49.340 --> 01:07:55.040
And its expectation may also be
able to fluctuate in the space

01:07:55.040 --> 01:07:55.970
time.

01:07:55.970 --> 01:07:59.670
But the only sensible way to
talk about expectation value

01:07:59.670 --> 01:08:01.640
is to talk about its
value at the boundary

01:08:01.640 --> 01:08:05.460
because we assume the boundary
conditions don't fluctuate.

01:08:05.460 --> 01:08:07.357
It's the same thing
for flat space.

01:08:07.357 --> 01:08:09.190
And we always specify
the boundary condition

01:08:09.190 --> 01:08:11.030
at the spatial
infinity, for example.

01:08:11.030 --> 01:08:14.600
And in the AdS, which is also
space time with a boundary,

01:08:14.600 --> 01:08:19.240
than we can associate
the constant parts

01:08:19.240 --> 01:08:23.217
of the expectation value as
the value at the boundary.

01:08:34.569 --> 01:08:37.230
Now you have to use a little
bit stretch of imagination.

01:08:41.020 --> 01:08:43.310
The following fact,
you don't need to.

01:08:43.310 --> 01:08:47.420
So now, with this relation, we
have established a connection

01:08:47.420 --> 01:08:52.290
between the Yang-Mills theory
coupling with the value of phi

01:08:52.290 --> 01:08:54.116
at the boundary of AdS.

01:09:01.439 --> 01:09:07.229
And now remember, this
Yang-Mills coupling,

01:09:07.229 --> 01:09:10.330
so I will not be careful about
1 over Yang-Mills squared.

01:09:10.330 --> 01:09:11.550
This is related.

01:09:11.550 --> 01:09:20.832
This is the coupling or source
for the Lagrangian of N equals

01:09:20.832 --> 01:09:22.040
to 4 super Yang-Mills theory.

01:09:40.750 --> 01:09:47.580
So now we can deduce
here two things.

01:09:47.580 --> 01:09:58.170
In particular, if we
deform the Lagrangian,

01:09:58.170 --> 01:10:06.160
say, change this coupling,
deform the boundary

01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:08.646
by changing the coupling,
which corresponds

01:10:08.646 --> 01:10:12.290
to you add some delta G,
say the Lagrangian of N

01:10:12.290 --> 01:10:16.650
equal to 4 super Yang-Mills,
deform the boundary

01:10:16.650 --> 01:10:18.440
set by changing the coupling.

01:10:18.440 --> 01:10:21.650
And this corresponding
to you essentially

01:10:21.650 --> 01:10:35.637
change the boundary
value of dilaton

01:10:35.637 --> 01:10:36.720
because these are related.

01:10:40.790 --> 01:10:45.320
So now, this example gives us
the answer to this question.

01:10:51.600 --> 01:10:58.065
This example gives
us this question.

01:11:01.540 --> 01:11:12.600
From here, we can deduce first
that the operator corresponding

01:11:12.600 --> 01:11:15.620
to the dilaton must be the N
equal to 4 super Yang-Mills

01:11:15.620 --> 01:11:21.690
Lagrangian, as you can already
deduce from some other methods,

01:11:21.690 --> 01:11:23.670
say using group
theory, et cetera.

01:11:27.300 --> 01:11:36.980
And the second is that phi
0 O, in the boundary theory,

01:11:36.980 --> 01:11:43.430
adding a phi 0 O in
the boundary theory

01:11:43.430 --> 01:11:48.250
must be related-- now I'm
generalizing this story.

01:11:48.250 --> 01:11:52.530
The bulk field phi-- so
now I'm no longer not

01:11:52.530 --> 01:11:54.290
necessarily using the dilaton.

01:11:54.290 --> 01:12:09.170
The bulk field phi due to O
has a boundary value phi 0.

01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:20.170
Any questions about this?

01:12:25.380 --> 01:12:25.880
Yes?

01:12:25.880 --> 01:12:27.416
AUDIENCE: Your
choice of operator O

01:12:27.416 --> 01:12:29.416
should be consistent with
all symmetries, right?

01:12:29.416 --> 01:12:30.326
HONG LIU: Hm?

01:12:30.326 --> 01:12:31.826
AUDIENCE: You're
not pre-choosing O?

01:12:31.826 --> 01:12:32.367
HONG LIU: No.

01:12:32.367 --> 01:12:34.035
O can be anything.

01:12:34.035 --> 01:12:36.284
AUDIENCE: Consistent with
original symmetries of the--

01:12:36.284 --> 01:12:37.784
HONG LIU: No, it
doesn't have to be.

01:12:37.784 --> 01:12:40.200
You can deform the
theory without-- you

01:12:40.200 --> 01:12:41.930
can break the symmetry.

01:12:41.930 --> 01:12:44.150
That deformation can
break the symmetry.

01:12:44.150 --> 01:12:45.650
If you want to
preserve the symmetry

01:12:45.650 --> 01:12:49.390
of the original Lagrangian,
then you can choose a certain O.

01:12:49.390 --> 01:12:51.910
But in principle, you
can choose any O. You can

01:12:51.910 --> 01:12:54.510
break the symmetry if you want.

01:12:54.510 --> 01:12:57.206
AUDIENCE: Do you have
to always then break

01:12:57.206 --> 01:12:59.485
some symmetry on the AdS part?

01:12:59.485 --> 01:13:00.110
HONG LIU: Yeah.

01:13:02.660 --> 01:13:05.170
Impose this kind of
boundary conditions.

01:13:05.170 --> 01:13:09.260
Then you may break
AdS symmetry too.

01:13:09.260 --> 01:13:11.470
So now we have
answered this question.

01:13:11.470 --> 01:13:15.360
And then of course, this
just provides the answer.

01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:17.190
Then you would check it.

01:13:17.190 --> 01:13:20.180
And we will check it
later using other methods.

01:13:20.180 --> 01:13:23.250
Now I'm saying because I
already know it's true.

01:13:23.250 --> 01:13:26.820
But in real life, what you
will do from this example,

01:13:26.820 --> 01:13:28.920
you will say, ah,
this must be the case.

01:13:28.920 --> 01:13:32.635
Then you will start trying
to find examples to check it.

01:13:32.635 --> 01:13:35.530
Start to find other
ways to check it.

01:13:35.530 --> 01:13:38.160
And we will describe it later.

01:13:38.160 --> 01:13:40.690
So in the end, what
we will describe

01:13:40.690 --> 01:13:41.890
is a self consistent story.

01:13:41.890 --> 01:13:47.120
I will not contradict myself
in my later discussion.

01:13:47.120 --> 01:14:02.195
So if we assume this, I
can also use this to argue.

01:14:13.510 --> 01:14:21.880
I can also use
this identification

01:14:21.880 --> 01:14:23.930
to argue this too.

01:14:23.930 --> 01:14:30.060
So let me call this
star and star star.

01:14:30.060 --> 01:14:40.990
I can use this identification
to make star and star star

01:14:40.990 --> 01:14:50.875
natural for any
duality, not only N

01:14:50.875 --> 01:14:56.555
equals 4 super Yang-Mills theory
and this type IIB gravity.

01:14:59.830 --> 01:15:02.210
It's that any conserved
curve in the boundary theory

01:15:02.210 --> 01:15:06.040
must be equal to some gauge
field in the gravity side,

01:15:06.040 --> 01:15:10.630
and the stress tensor should
always be due to the metric.

01:15:10.630 --> 01:15:15.530
So now I'm going to
use this argument

01:15:15.530 --> 01:15:17.190
to make that a little
bit more natural.

01:15:23.060 --> 01:15:27.080
So let's first consider this.

01:15:27.080 --> 01:15:35.810
So suppose I have a conserved
current, J, J. I have a J mu.

01:15:38.430 --> 01:15:41.550
For simplicity, let me
just take it to be u(1).

01:15:41.550 --> 01:15:44.410
Then I can deform
the boundary theory

01:15:44.410 --> 01:15:50.550
by adding a source for this J mu
by adding a boundary Lagrangian

01:15:50.550 --> 01:15:51.860
term like this.

01:15:51.860 --> 01:15:52.835
And a mu is the source.

01:15:58.890 --> 01:16:03.670
And then according to
this identification,

01:16:03.670 --> 01:16:11.570
the A mu must be A mu-- we
should be able to identify it

01:16:11.570 --> 01:16:15.470
as the boundary value of some
bulk field, A mu evaluated

01:16:15.470 --> 01:16:16.974
at z equal to 0.

01:16:20.790 --> 01:16:22.437
So this is a bulk vector field.

01:16:28.310 --> 01:16:32.050
So if this is true, there
must exist a vector field

01:16:32.050 --> 01:16:34.480
due to this vector field.

01:16:34.480 --> 01:16:38.170
And this must correspond to
the boundary value of that.

01:16:38.170 --> 01:16:42.630
But now we can argue why
this should be a gauge field.

01:16:42.630 --> 01:16:45.430
So now I want to argue
this is a gauge field.

01:16:45.430 --> 01:16:49.660
And to see this is very
easy because since J mu is

01:16:49.660 --> 01:16:53.820
conserved, then this
coupling-- so let

01:16:53.820 --> 01:16:57.500
me call this star star star.

01:16:57.500 --> 01:17:03.590
Let me call it star star star.

01:17:03.590 --> 01:17:10.700
So since this is conserved,
and this star star star

01:17:10.700 --> 01:17:18.210
is invariant under the
following transformation,

01:17:18.210 --> 01:17:24.940
A mu goes to A mu plus partial
mu lambda x for any lambda x.

01:17:35.050 --> 01:17:42.530
So that means the A mu, this
A is the boundary value of A.

01:17:42.530 --> 01:17:46.290
So that means this
capital A, that

01:17:46.290 --> 01:17:55.090
means the dynamics of this A
mu should also be invariant.

01:18:01.740 --> 01:18:04.520
If I change the boundary value
of A by this transformation,

01:18:04.520 --> 01:18:07.210
the dynamics of A mu
should also not change.

01:18:07.210 --> 01:18:13.440
Let me call it AM so the bulk
and general will be different.

01:18:13.440 --> 01:18:17.210
But this is like a
gauge transformation.

01:18:17.210 --> 01:18:19.840
So this is like a
gauge transformation.

01:18:19.840 --> 01:18:22.850
So we deduce that
somehow, this must

01:18:22.850 --> 01:18:24.960
be some subset of the
bulk gauge transformation.

01:18:32.492 --> 01:18:36.770
Now call it star to the power 4.

01:18:36.770 --> 01:18:44.240
Then star to the
power 4 also must

01:18:44.240 --> 01:18:52.885
be a subset of some bulk
gauge transformation.

01:19:03.400 --> 01:19:06.100
So this does not prove it,
but makes it more natural.

01:19:06.100 --> 01:19:07.620
This argument makes
it more natural.

01:19:07.620 --> 01:19:10.910
The fact that the
boundary value of A

01:19:10.910 --> 01:19:12.340
has such kind of gauge symmetry.

01:19:15.140 --> 01:19:18.440
So in some sense,
this must generalize

01:19:18.440 --> 01:19:23.270
to some gauge symmetry
in the full gravity side.

01:19:23.270 --> 01:19:28.049
So similarly, you can do this
for the metric for the stress

01:19:28.049 --> 01:19:28.549
tensor.

01:19:32.165 --> 01:19:34.206
Similarly, you can do this
for the stress tensor.

01:19:39.020 --> 01:19:49.370
So for the stress tensor,
so for the star star, again,

01:19:49.370 --> 01:20:01.380
we can add h mu mu x T mu mu
to the boundary Lagrangian.

01:20:01.380 --> 01:20:05.920
And this is the source
to the stress tensor.

01:20:11.050 --> 01:20:16.152
And now, from your knowledge
of quantum field theory,

01:20:16.152 --> 01:20:23.890
when I add such a term to the
field theory, it's the same.

01:20:23.890 --> 01:20:34.140
So this is equivalent to I
deform the boundary space

01:20:34.140 --> 01:20:45.620
time metric from just eta mu
mu to eta mu mu plus h mu mu.

01:20:48.220 --> 01:20:51.667
So let me call this
quantity g mu mu b.

01:20:58.270 --> 01:21:02.200
So adding such a term
source for the stress tensor

01:21:02.200 --> 01:21:04.140
is like you deform your
space time geometry

01:21:04.140 --> 01:21:06.710
a little bit by this source.

01:21:06.710 --> 01:21:09.435
This is when h is very small.

01:21:09.435 --> 01:21:10.810
When we consider
the information,

01:21:10.810 --> 01:21:12.434
we always consider
the source is small.

01:21:16.430 --> 01:21:22.980
But now, we can argue this
thing, mass corresponding

01:21:22.980 --> 01:21:28.220
to the boundary
value of the metric

01:21:28.220 --> 01:21:31.750
in the gravity side for
the following reason.

01:21:31.750 --> 01:21:34.890
So if you look at
this expression,

01:21:34.890 --> 01:21:36.380
so if you look at
even the pure AdS

01:21:36.380 --> 01:21:38.540
metric before you
do any deformation,

01:21:38.540 --> 01:21:44.820
so this is just due to
the original theory.

01:21:44.820 --> 01:21:55.550
So from the AdS metric, so
the original AdS metric,

01:21:55.550 --> 01:21:56.590
the g mu mu component.

01:22:00.590 --> 01:22:05.320
So let me write this
AdS metric in the form,

01:22:05.320 --> 01:22:08.255
say, R squared, z
squared, separate

01:22:08.255 --> 01:22:10.050
the z squared with the rest.

01:22:14.940 --> 01:22:18.492
So this is essentially the
component of the bulk metric

01:22:18.492 --> 01:22:19.700
along the boundary direction.

01:22:26.430 --> 01:22:34.540
The boundary value of this
metric component evaluates

01:22:34.540 --> 01:22:37.490
z equal to 0 is
equal to R squared

01:22:37.490 --> 01:22:42.370
divided by z squared eta mu mu.

01:22:42.370 --> 01:22:47.100
So that just comes from the
AdS metric, just this g mu mu.

01:22:47.100 --> 01:22:49.960
And when you go the
boundary, just given by this.

01:22:49.960 --> 01:22:50.910
And this is eta mu mu.

01:22:50.910 --> 01:22:53.190
We recognize it just
as the boundary metric.

01:23:01.300 --> 01:23:02.684
So these correspond to deform.

01:23:06.634 --> 01:23:08.050
Since adding this
term corresponds

01:23:08.050 --> 01:23:11.400
to deform the boundary
metric, so we expect,

01:23:11.400 --> 01:23:13.450
when we add this term,
so this corresponding

01:23:13.450 --> 01:23:21.413
to deform the g mu mu
now to the 0 become.

01:23:24.140 --> 01:23:28.582
So we expect this becomes
equal to g mu mu b.

01:23:36.400 --> 01:23:40.400
So this tells you
that the stress tensor

01:23:40.400 --> 01:23:44.710
must be due to the metric
perturbations in the gravity

01:23:44.710 --> 01:23:45.210
side.

01:23:48.070 --> 01:23:50.844
The stress tensor
must be corresponding

01:23:50.844 --> 01:23:52.760
to the metric perturbation
on the gravity side

01:23:52.760 --> 01:23:54.843
because it's corresponding
to perturb the boundary

01:23:54.843 --> 01:23:59.430
conditions of the bulk
metric-- corresponding

01:23:59.430 --> 01:24:02.350
to preserve the boundary
condition for the bulk metric.

01:24:02.350 --> 01:24:07.650
So this is a very
general statement

01:24:07.650 --> 01:24:11.740
valid for any correspondence
between the gravity

01:24:11.740 --> 01:24:14.029
and the field theory.

01:24:14.029 --> 01:24:16.320
And that also tells you that
if you have a theory which

01:24:16.320 --> 01:24:20.390
due into a higher dimensional
theory, and then that theory,

01:24:20.390 --> 01:24:23.230
if the field theory
has a stress tensor,

01:24:23.230 --> 01:24:28.630
then this bulk theory
must have gravity

01:24:28.630 --> 01:24:32.480
because this bulk theory
must have a dynamical metric.

01:24:36.510 --> 01:24:39.200
And if you have a dynamical
metric, then you have gravity.

01:24:39.200 --> 01:24:42.630
So you can say, if
any field theory

01:24:42.630 --> 01:24:47.030
is due to a theory of one higher
dimension, that theory of one

01:24:47.030 --> 01:24:52.220
higher dimension must involve
gravity-- nothing about quantum

01:24:52.220 --> 01:24:55.150
gravity.

01:24:55.150 --> 01:24:57.116
Let's stop here.

00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:04.370
PROFESSOR: Two particles is
interesting in many cases.

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:07.880
But in order to see
what really is happening

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:11.150
and how much structure you
have to go to more than two

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:12.270
particles.

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:16.520
Two particles is a
little too special.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.040
So we need to go
beyond two particles

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.110
and see what happens
with this operator.

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:26.420
So I'll do that.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.880
So we'll add more particles.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.120
So let's do that.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:45.730
So if you have n particles,
n particles, capital n,

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:48.370
we can consider
also permutations.

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.850
And how many permutations
are you going to have?

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.090
You're going to have n
factorial permutations.

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.890
And notation of Hilbert
space, n factorial permutation

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.690
operators.

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.540
So why you say n factorial?

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.340
Because a permutation is a
reordering of your n objects.

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.730
And therefore, in order
to define the reordering,

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:22.330
you must decide which object
is going to be the new first.

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.230
You have your n objects there.

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:28.680
So you have n choices to pick
a first and n minus 1 choices

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.930
to be a second, n minus 2.

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.740
So n factorial is the
number of permutations.

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.700
The permutations form a group.

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:54.020
So the permutations
of n objects form

00:01:54.020 --> 00:02:09.550
this symmetric group s capital
n with n factorial elements.

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:20.060
Just like you study
the group su2 of two

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:26.180
by two unitary matrices,
or the group so3 of three

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.330
dimensional rotations in space.

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.520
The permutation
group is the group

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.560
that deserves a lot of study.

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.440
It's a finite discrete group.

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.040
It's not a continuous
group of transformations.

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.500
It's discrete transformations.

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.750
And they do funny things.

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.840
So we need to
understand this group so

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.430
let's describe the notation
of what is a permutation.

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:58.550
Suppose you have n
equal 4, four particles.

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:06.590
So a given state is
represented by a, b, c, d.

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.770
And you could say this is the
first particle, second, third,

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:10.790
and fourth.

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.890
And these are the states.

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.020
And now we're going to
write the perturbation.

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:21.770
The best thing, I think, is
just do an example, p3142.

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:29.400
So a permutation now has capital
n labels, so four labels.

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.320
And this is a permutation
acting on this state.

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:38.150
Remember the 2-1
permutation exchange.

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.620
The state in 2 was put in 1.

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.780
The state in 1 was put in 2.

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.810
Here is the instruction.

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:52.920
So the instruction is, put in
position one the third state.

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.800
So here it says 3,
so the third state

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.570
goes into the first position.

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:03.350
So that's the first position.

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:12.970
The first state goes
into the second position.

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:16.490
The fourth state goes
into the third position.

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:17.620
The third in this here.

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.320
So the third position
is now occupied

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.160
by the fourth state, d.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:31.390
And the second state goes
into the fourth position, b.

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:37.420
So this is the way we are
going to define permutations.

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:39.430
People define them
in different ways

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:43.360
and you have to be sure
you know what it means.

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.060
But I'll right this.

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:56.695
This means put third
object in first position.

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:07.660
Here the second one, let's
write put first object

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:09.055
in second position.

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:30.910
It's nice to have this notation
because now you can understand

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:33.700
how the group works.

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:39.760
A group of
transformations is a set

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:44.560
of elements that
can be multiplied.

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:47.320
There is an identity.

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:51.730
And things have
inverses as well.

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:55.360
So permutations have inverses.

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:58.120
If you rearrange the
objects in one way,

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:02.150
you can rearrange them back.

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:06.640
So for example, what
would be the inverse

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:09.040
of this permutation?

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:20.110
I will try to figure out
what is the inverse of p3142.

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:23.650
So I look at this
thing and I think

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:28.540
of what is the instruction
that I must put in order

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:31.090
to rearrange back this series.

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:36.520
And I say, well, I must put the
second back in position one.

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:41.290
So there should be a p2 here.

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:45.250
I should put the
fourth in position two.

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:55.485
And then I should put the
first in position three.

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:03.940
First in position three.

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:08.185
And I should put the
third in position four.

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:17.060
So I claim that is the
inverse of this operator,

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:22.280
p213 is the inverse of this.

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:25.670
So you can check it.

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:42.920
Again, p2413 times p3142,
you just do it on a, b, c, d.

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:50.870
Well, the first one, you
already know, is 2413,

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:54.350
is put the third in one.

00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:57.710
Put the first in two.

00:07:57.710 --> 00:08:01.490
Put the fourth in three.

00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:06.380
And put the second in fourth, b.

00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:09.770
And then it says, put
the second first--

00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:11.690
so that's an a.

00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:15.860
Put the fourth, second, b.

00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:20.000
Put the first, third, c.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.860
And put the third, fourth, d.

00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:27.420
So it's back to
the original one.

00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:30.340
So indeed, it is the inverse.

00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:34.400
So you can write your
permutations and play with them

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:38.510
and figure out how to
multiply any two permutations.

00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:45.110
More generally, we'll write
the permutation as follows.

00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:56.930
Suppose you have more generally
a permutations [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:56.930 --> 00:09:01.990
with some index alpha,
collective index alpha,

00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:07.360
that says how the
integers, 1 up to n,

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:16.870
are rearranged into alpha of 1,
alpha of 2, up to alpha of n.

00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:24.480
So think of a permutation
and thinking n integers

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:26.460
and rearranging them.

00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:32.550
So the first one,
the new first index

00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:35.130
is going to be alpha
of 1, alpha of 2.

00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:42.960
And alpha is a rule that takes
the n integers from 1 to n

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:46.240
and reshuffles them.

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:50.040
So if you have a state--

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:52.290
so this is a simple
thing because then

00:09:52.290 --> 00:10:02.090
if you have a p alpha, this
alpha means really p alpha1,

00:10:02.090 --> 00:10:05.700
alpha2, all these things.

00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:08.340
Be alpha1, alpha2,
alpha3, alpha4.

00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:26.760
If those act on u1 1, u2
2, up to u n, capital n, n,

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:28.860
what does it give you?

00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:32.490
Well, it says here
that you should

00:10:32.490 --> 00:10:41.290
put the 1 that has alpha 1
here on the first position.

00:10:41.290 --> 00:10:46.350
So you should put,
first, the u alpha1.

00:10:52.390 --> 00:10:57.730
And then you should
put next the u alpha2.

00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:10.950
And all the way up
to the u alpha n.

00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:15.550
That's in formulas,
the rule that I

00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:19.480
was giving you above there.

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:25.270
It tells you how to move the
state from one to the other.

00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:44.700
You see, if alpha1
was 3, it would

00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:49.130
correspond to take the state
u3 and putting it first.

00:11:49.130 --> 00:11:54.080
So it's like that.

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:57.080
So whatever alpha 1,
is whatever number,

00:11:57.080 --> 00:12:06.750
that state must be pulled
into the first [INAUDIBLE]..

00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:14.850
OK, so let's just think
a little about an example

00:12:14.850 --> 00:12:22.270
because it starts
getting interesting.

00:12:22.270 --> 00:12:27.970
So let's do three particles
for a little while, just

00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:29.200
to see what it is.

00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:49.020
So three particles, n equal 3.

00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:51.450
So what are the
permutation operators?

00:12:51.450 --> 00:12:55.955
You would say p123 is what?

00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:02.100
Put the first particle first,
the second particle second,

00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:03.600
the third particle third.

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:05.010
Doesn't do anything.

00:13:05.010 --> 00:13:07.200
That is the identity.

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:09.585
So that's the identity element.

00:13:12.810 --> 00:13:22.440
But then you could
cycle them, p321, p231.

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:26.310
These are two more elements.

00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:32.190
This should have six elements
because it's 3 factorial.

00:13:32.190 --> 00:13:41.580
And now you have the following
one, p132, for example.

00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:43.620
That was not in the list.

00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:45.870
You had the p123.

00:13:45.870 --> 00:13:50.010
Now you flip this to p132.

00:13:50.010 --> 00:14:02.510
If I cycle them, p321,
and p213, these are it.

00:14:02.510 --> 00:14:07.340
The middle one, 312, yes.

00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:16.100
I was supposed to be cycling
them, 312 and 231, yes.

00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:18.280
Otherwise I would
have repeated that.

00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:21.020
Good eye.

00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:25.490
OK, so these are our operators.

00:14:25.490 --> 00:14:30.350
And these ones
are kind of funny.

00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:32.180
They are simpler ones.

00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:34.940
Please look at them.

00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:39.360
This operator says put the first
particle in the first position.

00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:43.265
So the first particle
is left unchanged.

00:14:43.265 --> 00:14:46.010
But the 3 and 2 are permuted.

00:14:46.010 --> 00:14:48.470
So people sometimes write this.

00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:51.980
They say, this permutation
operator is just

00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:57.560
a single transposition,
32 or 23.

00:14:57.560 --> 00:15:01.520
These two are transposed and
the first is left invariant.

00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:06.560
So this can be written as
a single transposition.

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:10.910
In this permutation operator,
a 2 is left invariant.

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:14.960
The second state is copied
to the second position.

00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:17.570
But the 1 and 3 are
exchanged, so this

00:15:17.570 --> 00:15:21.090
is a transposition of 1 and 3.

00:15:24.370 --> 00:15:28.170
And in this last
permutation operator,

00:15:28.170 --> 00:15:30.540
the third state
is left invariant

00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:31.960
on the third position.

00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:34.260
Nevertheless, the
second is put in first

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:36.240
and the first is put in second.

00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:38.760
So it's a 12 transposition.

00:15:45.650 --> 00:15:52.970
OK, so the group has broken into
things that are transpositions

00:15:52.970 --> 00:15:56.990
and slightly more
complicated things.

00:15:56.990 --> 00:15:59.090
Now, let's look at
the transpositions.

00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:03.290
So these are transpositions.

00:16:14.070 --> 00:16:20.780
OK, what about the
transpositions?

00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:24.200
Transpositions are like
the permutation operators

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:27.110
we were doing before
of two particles.

00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:29.860
You're just changing
two particles.

00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:34.060
You're leaving the
other ones unchanged.

00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:40.850
So these transpositions
are Hermitian and unitary.

00:16:40.850 --> 00:16:55.710
Positions are
Hermitian and unitary,

00:16:55.710 --> 00:17:01.500
just like we had p21 before.

00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:11.890
Now here comes the
first statement

00:17:11.890 --> 00:17:17.260
that is quite remarkable
about this permutation group.

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:22.150
Any permutation, now we
claim, is the product

00:17:22.150 --> 00:17:25.089
of some transpositions.

00:17:25.089 --> 00:17:29.980
You see, if somebody gives you
a permutation of n integers,

00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:33.700
I think you're convinced that
by changing two at a time,

00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:36.460
you can reach that.

00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:40.840
So that means that with
transpositions, you can

00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:43.060
reach every possible element.

00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:51.370
So any-- this is very
important-- any permutation is

00:17:51.370 --> 00:17:57.540
the product of transpositions.

00:18:04.050 --> 00:18:10.350
And that implies, in a
sense, the main result

00:18:10.350 --> 00:18:14.220
that you want from operators
in this Hilbert space.

00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:20.220
Since transpositions are
unitary and any permutation

00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:26.400
is a product of transpositions,
any permutation is unitary.

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:35.530
So all permutations are unitary.

00:18:41.950 --> 00:18:48.370
It's not true that all
permutations are Hermitian.

00:18:48.370 --> 00:18:49.960
You see, when you
have the product

00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:52.870
of her Hermitian
operators the product

00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:57.670
of her Hermitian operators
is not necessarily Hermitian.

00:18:57.670 --> 00:18:59.096
You've seen that.

00:18:59.096 --> 00:19:00.970
If you have two operators
that are Hermitian,

00:19:00.970 --> 00:19:02.890
the order changes.

00:19:02.890 --> 00:19:09.700
And the product is not
Hermitian, x and p.

00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:13.070
Hermitian operators, the
product is not Hermitian.

00:19:13.070 --> 00:19:19.690
So all permutations are
unitary but are not Hermitian.

00:19:19.690 --> 00:19:23.700
And the third concept
that comes here

00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:29.440
illustrated [INAUDIBLE] also
a very fundamental concept.

00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:34.940
We said that any permutation
is a product of transpositions.

00:19:37.890 --> 00:19:41.400
But it's not a unique
product of transposition.

00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:43.050
In fact, you could--

00:19:43.050 --> 00:19:46.920
if you are given
some order of objects

00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:50.190
and you're asked to rearrange
them by transposition,

00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:53.130
you may do them in
different order.

00:19:53.130 --> 00:19:57.000
So the product is not
uniquely determined.

00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:03.600
The product is,
in fact, you could

00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:08.640
find somebody that does a
permutation with some number

00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:11.940
of transpositions
and another person

00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:14.250
with another set
of transpositions.

00:20:14.250 --> 00:20:17.790
But one thing that
has to happen--

00:20:17.790 --> 00:20:20.760
and it's always the
same-- is that the number

00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:26.640
of transpositions is the
same [INAUDIBLE] two.

00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:31.080
That is, if you find that to
get a permutation you need

00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:33.690
an even number of
transpositions,

00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:41.460
everybody else will need also an
even number of transpositions.

00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:44.280
If you find an odd
number of transpositions,

00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:48.030
everybody will find an odd
number of transpositions.

00:20:48.030 --> 00:20:51.240
And that's kind of
clear if you have--

00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:55.950
if you've achieved
the desired order

00:20:55.950 --> 00:20:59.040
by doing some number
of transpositions,

00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:01.980
you can add two
more transpositions

00:21:01.980 --> 00:21:03.330
and not change anything.

00:21:03.330 --> 00:21:06.600
You can flip two objects
and flip them back.

00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:11.040
So this is a pretty
important result as well.

00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:17.280
So it means that permutations
are either even or are odd.

00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:35.990
So permutations
are even, if built

00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:48.740
with an even number
of transpositions

00:21:48.740 --> 00:22:01.880
or odd if built with an odd
number of transpositions.

00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:07.160
So two kinds of permutations,
even permutations

00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:08.630
or odd permutations.

00:22:13.010 --> 00:22:16.760
So all these things
we've kind of

00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:21.050
seen with this
permutation group.

00:22:21.050 --> 00:22:28.040
There's one more thing
that is necessary to note.

00:22:31.170 --> 00:22:36.750
Something that may have
seemed that coincidence there.

00:22:36.750 --> 00:22:44.170
In fact, the 3 on the
right are transpositions.

00:22:44.170 --> 00:22:46.320
And they're a single
transposition each.

00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:52.600
So each one of those on the
right is an odd permutation.

00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:55.000
It's built with
one transposition.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:59.980
On the other hand, the other
ones are even transpositions,

00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:02.500
the first three.

00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:06.070
The first one is built
with zero transpositions

00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:10.930
but the others are built
with two transpositions.

00:23:10.930 --> 00:23:14.740
It's something you could
just see in detail.

00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:18.310
In fact, I would
say it's worth doing

00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:23.140
the table of multiplication
of this group.

00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:30.370
But that coincidence is,
in fact, true in any--

00:23:30.370 --> 00:23:51.360
in sn, in the group sn, the
number of even permutations

00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:59.860
is equal to the number
of odd permutations.

00:24:06.180 --> 00:24:10.680
Some pretty nice result.
There's equal numbers of even

00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:16.620
and odd permutations in
any permutation group.

00:24:16.620 --> 00:24:20.970
Actually, it's surprisingly
simple to show that.

00:24:20.970 --> 00:24:24.210
You think of the even
permutations here-- here are

00:24:24.210 --> 00:24:26.760
the even permutations.

00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:28.800
And here are the
odd permutations.

00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:38.010
And you can easily
show that there

00:24:38.010 --> 00:24:40.640
is equal number on this one.

00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:43.020
So let do it.

00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:49.190
One way is to take the
permutation element.

00:24:49.190 --> 00:24:53.640
So suppose you have
a permutation--

00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:55.940
how should I call it--

00:24:55.940 --> 00:24:58.640
p21.

00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:01.620
You leave everything the
same but you have p21.

00:25:01.620 --> 00:25:07.650
That permutes the
second and first labels.

00:25:07.650 --> 00:25:10.880
Since it's an n group, the
rest are left invariant,

00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:13.910
so 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

00:25:13.910 --> 00:25:21.740
And you say, this maps
any permutation here

00:25:21.740 --> 00:25:23.540
into a permutation there.

00:25:23.540 --> 00:25:24.440
Why?

00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:29.360
Because if you have an
even permutation here,

00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:35.570
any element here has an even
number of transient mutations,

00:25:35.570 --> 00:25:37.470
of transpositions.

00:25:37.470 --> 00:25:40.300
So this is another
transposition,

00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:42.110
it transposes 2 and 1.

00:25:42.110 --> 00:25:47.480
So when you multiply
an element here by p21,

00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:49.660
if it has an even number
of transpositions,

00:25:49.660 --> 00:25:51.050
now it has an odd one.

00:25:51.050 --> 00:25:55.910
So it must land somewhere here.

00:25:55.910 --> 00:26:03.995
So any-- this p21
maps the even--

00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:12.510
the even permutations
to the odd permutations.

00:26:18.460 --> 00:26:25.750
Moreover, it maps them in
what's called 1 to 1 fashion.

00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:29.320
If you have two permutations
here that are different,

00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:33.220
it will map to two permutations
here that are different.

00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:33.740
Why?

00:26:33.740 --> 00:26:41.120
Because suppose you have here
pi and pj, two permutations.

00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:50.260
1 is mapped to p21 pi, and
the other is map to p21 pj.

00:26:50.260 --> 00:26:56.380
But if pi and pj
are different, two

00:26:56.380 --> 00:27:01.180
permutations here,
I and j, pi and pj.

00:27:01.180 --> 00:27:05.020
And if they are
different, then it

00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:09.070
follows that these two are
different as well after you

00:27:09.070 --> 00:27:11.590
multiply them by p21.

00:27:11.590 --> 00:27:12.730
Why?

00:27:12.730 --> 00:27:17.380
Because if they were
equal, p21 has an inverse.

00:27:17.380 --> 00:27:21.100
It is itself p21, so you
could multiply them in.

00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:25.030
And then you would show
that pi is equal to pj.

00:27:25.030 --> 00:27:27.250
And that can't happen.

00:27:27.250 --> 00:27:31.090
So two different
elements here will

00:27:31.090 --> 00:27:34.490
go to two different
elements there.

00:27:34.490 --> 00:27:39.460
So if you think of all
your elements here, go--

00:27:39.460 --> 00:27:44.110
if you have 20 elements here,
they go to 20 elements here.

00:27:44.110 --> 00:27:47.530
The only thing that can happen
is that some elements are not

00:27:47.530 --> 00:27:49.750
reached here.

00:27:49.750 --> 00:27:52.880
That would mean that these
two sets are not the same.

00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:57.250
So you need to show that
this map reaches everybody.

00:27:57.250 --> 00:28:02.665
So this shows it's
a one to one map.

00:28:07.540 --> 00:28:10.210
And in fact, it's
kind of a joke,

00:28:10.210 --> 00:28:15.100
but in a way to think
of this, one to one

00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:18.490
really means two to
two, in the sense

00:28:18.490 --> 00:28:22.040
that two things
go to two things.

00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:25.660
So it's kind of a
funny name, one to one.

00:28:25.660 --> 00:28:27.370
So the other thing
is that you need

00:28:27.370 --> 00:28:29.590
to show that everybody reaches.

00:28:29.590 --> 00:28:31.250
So the map is--

00:28:31.250 --> 00:28:35.260
let's call surjective,
everybody reaches.

00:28:35.260 --> 00:28:38.110
So it's clear that
everybody reaches

00:28:38.110 --> 00:28:47.620
because if you have a pk
in here, permutation pk,

00:28:47.620 --> 00:28:54.960
this pk can be written as
p21 times p21 times pk.

00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:57.640
Because p21 times p21 is 1.

00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:08.000
And this pk, since this
was an odd permutation,

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:11.610
this is an even one.

00:29:11.610 --> 00:29:14.370
And then you've shown
that pk is obtained

00:29:14.370 --> 00:29:17.790
by acting with p21 on
some even permutation.

00:29:17.790 --> 00:29:19.320
So you'll reach.

00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:21.826
So the map is surjective.

00:29:26.050 --> 00:29:29.500
And therefore these two
things are the same.

00:29:29.500 --> 00:29:34.270
They're identical numbers of
even and odd permutations,

00:29:34.270 --> 00:29:38.844
a very nice fact
about these groups.

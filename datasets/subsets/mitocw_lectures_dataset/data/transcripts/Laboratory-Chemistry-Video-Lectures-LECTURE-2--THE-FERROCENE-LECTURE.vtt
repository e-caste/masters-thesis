00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:18.430
JOHN DOLHUN: Welcome to
the ferrocene lecture.

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:21.010
We are going to do a
demonstration at the start

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:24.580
because I'm going to be talking
about additional reactions

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:26.830
during this lecture.

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:31.380
And I want you to
actually see one happen.

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.460
So I've got Amanda
Trainor, who is

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.260
manning the fire extinguisher.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.290
Amanda just had her fire
extinguisher testing.

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:40.090
So she is ready to go.

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.300
And Dr. Sarah
Hewett will actually

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.950
assist me with the
bromine that we're using.

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:51.400
Bromine and me go way back
because I made bromine

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.140
when I was in high school.

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:54.730
In the parents of my--

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:57.190
in my parents' home--
in the basement.

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.830
The whole place filled up
with reddish brown gas.

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:03.010
And back in those days,
the chemistry sets

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:05.710
had real chemicals in them.

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.190
So what we're going to do is we
are going to cook some bacon.

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:12.610
And we are going to
crack the glycerol.

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.810
And we going to make this
unsaturated compound acrolein.

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.120
Then we're going to throw
it into the bromine.

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.150
And the bromine should add
across the double bond--

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:24.410
an addition reaction.

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:28.420
This is the acrid
smelly stuff that you

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:29.980
smell when you cook bacon.

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:33.970
This is the burned bacon
fat smell that you smell.

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:39.170
It's colorless, flammable,
and very poisonous.

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.540
So let's go.

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.910
We're going to start this.

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:47.500
So I'm using a
creme brulee torch.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:48.370
It's my wife's.

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:52.510
She's probably out of her
mind now looking for it.

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:53.680
So we're cooking the bacon.

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.810
And we're going to get that
bacon fat-- the glycerol--

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.560
broken down.

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:03.060
Ready?

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:08.780
And here we go.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.300
So we've thrown the
bacon into the bromine.

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.450
You can start to see
the color disappearing.

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.855
Color is adding across the
double bond of the bacon.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.850
And I present to
you bacon dibromide.

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:36.824
Good stuff.

00:02:36.824 --> 00:02:37.640
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:38.150
Thank you.

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:42.710
I actually don't
eat a lot of bacon

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:48.140
anymore after doing this demo
knowing that stuff is so nasty

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:49.820
and a cancer producer too.

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.150
So all right.

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.210
Let me get this
hot lab coat off.

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.400
So Emil Fischer and
Geoffrey Wilkinson

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.460
win the Nobel Prize
in chemistry back

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:25.530
in 1973 for their
independent work looking

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:31.350
at these organo-metallic
sandwich like compounds.

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:36.240
It all started here in
1951 with a paper published

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:39.360
by Pauson and
Keely, "In Nature,"

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:44.370
where they took a Grignard
like reagent cyclopentadienyl

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.890
magnesium bromide.

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:50.760
And they tried to get an
oxidative coupling of this ring

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.380
hoping to make fulvalene.

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.240
Instead, they got this
stable orange complex.

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.250
Empirical formula C10H10Fe.

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:08.390
Right after this paper came
out the fellow on the right,

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:13.340
Geoffrey Wilkinson, who was at
MIT, had just moved to Harvard.

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:16.579
And both him and Woodward at
Harvard looked at this paper

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:19.160
and said, wait a minute.

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:24.290
With these sigma
metal carbon bonds

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:28.640
they're saying that
this complex actually

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:34.140
is stable at very high
temperatures up to 400 degrees.

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:37.220
So that these bonds
would disintegrate

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:38.540
at those temperatures.

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:41.630
So they were skeptical
of this structure.

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:45.620
So they immediately said, well,
let's do an addition reaction.

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:47.870
Look at all the
double bonds here.

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.450
Should easily be able to
do an addition reaction

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:52.760
and add across
those double bonds.

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:55.390
They got no reaction.

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:57.800
So then they said, OK.

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:02.000
Just for the fun, let's try
a substitution reaction.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:08.280
For a substitution reaction
you need an aromatic system

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:10.230
such as benzene.

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:13.590
An electrophilic aromatic
substitution reaction

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:18.480
involves an electrophile,
which simply substitutes itself

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:21.540
for a hydrogen on
the aromatic ring

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:23.790
and gives you your product.

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:26.820
So they tried a
substitution reaction

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:28.335
and they actually
got a reaction.

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:34.620
Now they were a little bit
more puzzled because look

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:37.870
at cyclopentadiene.

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:39.160
Is it aromatic?

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:45.390
How many pi electrons are there?

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:45.890
Four.

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:46.790
Good.

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:50.190
And what is Huckel's rule?

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:53.510
Anyone know Huckel's rule?

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:54.470
Yeah?

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:55.100
Sean?

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:58.233
AUDIENCE: Pi electrons
are at the aromatic.

00:05:58.233 --> 00:05:58.900
JOHN DOLHUN: OK.

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:01.430
AUDIENCE: So this would
be [INAUDIBLE] aromatic.

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:04.500
JOHN DOLHUN: That's
one way to look at it.

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:08.780
So Huckel's rule is 4n plus 2.

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:09.950
Right?

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:18.350
4n plus 2 pi electrons where n
is a 0 or any positive integer

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:20.240
from 1 up.

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:24.260
If you put 0 in there
you get two electrons.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.000
That obviously has four.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.640
If you put one in
there you get six.

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:31.460
So this definitely does
not observe Huckel's rule.

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:34.420
It's not aromatic.

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:37.720
Most of these types of
hydrocarbons like this

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:43.690
have PKAs that are
greater than 50.

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:47.140
But it turns out
that cyclopentadiene

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:49.790
has these hydrogens
on there that

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:54.730
are slightly acidic because its
conjugate base is very stable--

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:57.040
stabilized by resonance.

00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:00.400
So if we take a--

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:01.810
where did I put my chalk, here.

00:07:11.869 --> 00:07:16.350
If we take a base here,
come in and abstract one

00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:26.750
of those protons, what we're
going to get is this anion.

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:31.040
And this is the
cyclopentadienide anion.

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:33.320
This has six electrons.

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:35.090
Now if you look at this system--

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:51.040
all of these SP2
hybridized carbon atoms

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:55.580
now have electron density
that they can share

00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:58.670
all around that entire ring.

00:07:58.670 --> 00:08:01.100
So this is an aromatic system.

00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:04.010
And what would Geoffrey
Wilkinson and Woodward said

00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:07.850
was, OK, so let's
take two of these,

00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:10.640
make kind of like a
sandwich structure--

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:14.630
six electrons on the bottom,
six electrons on the top,

00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:19.050
and six D electrons
from iron in the center.

00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:21.140
So you've got 18 electrons.

00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:24.710
That's kind of a magic number
for an inorganic chemist

00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:28.710
because it's got that
noble gas configuration.

00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:32.120
So the D electrons
from the iron are

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:37.549
pi bonding with the P electrons
from the hydrocarbons.

00:08:37.549 --> 00:08:42.140
This is a complete reversal
of the classical way

00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:47.120
of looking at ligand
metal bond coordination.

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:49.460
Everybody used the sigma bonds.

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:52.160
No one ever thought
about pi bonds.

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:54.660
Can I have two volunteers?

00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:55.160
Yes.

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:56.500
Come on up.

00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:57.000
Come on.

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:09.080
See if you can come over to
the front of the table here.

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:10.108
And you are?

00:09:10.108 --> 00:09:10.775
AUDIENCE: Aisha.

00:09:10.775 --> 00:09:11.567
JOHN DOLHUN: Aisha.

00:09:11.567 --> 00:09:12.195
And?

00:09:12.195 --> 00:09:12.820
AUDIENCE: Maya.

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:13.190
JOHN DOLHUN: Maya.

00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:13.690
OK.

00:09:13.690 --> 00:09:14.360
Aisha and Maya.

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:18.740
So let's see what mama
packed me for lunch today.

00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:19.250
Oh good.

00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:21.470
I got two pieces of bread here.

00:09:21.470 --> 00:09:22.820
Correct.

00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:25.010
OK.

00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:27.350
So Aisha, why don't
you hold the bread--

00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:31.370
one hand like that and
stagger the other one

00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:36.170
and put a space between it
and turn toward this way.

00:09:36.170 --> 00:09:37.160
Yeah.

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:39.050
Turn so it's-- yeah.

00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:41.600
Put the crust facing
the audience on one

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:44.730
and away from the
audience on the other.

00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:46.756
Maya, take the orange.

00:09:46.756 --> 00:09:48.090
And now let's see.

00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:49.650
Let's fix this a little bit.

00:09:49.650 --> 00:09:51.810
So there we go.

00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:54.150
And come down a little bit.

00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:55.440
Now Maya, come in.

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:57.930
Put the orange right there.

00:09:57.930 --> 00:09:58.800
There it is.

00:09:58.800 --> 00:09:59.490
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:01.440
A molecular sandwich.

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:05.970
That's ferrocene-- the two
cyclopentadienide anions

00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:09.330
and the iron atom in
the middle pi bonding

00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:11.160
with all their electrons.

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:12.180
Congratulations.

00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:13.190
Thank you.

00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:16.190
[APPLAUSE]

00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:18.942
Maya, do you like the orange?

00:10:18.942 --> 00:10:20.232
AUDIENCE: Sure, thank you.

00:10:20.232 --> 00:10:22.690
JOHN DOLHUN: I know you don't
want the bread, but oh, look.

00:10:22.690 --> 00:10:23.648
There's something else.

00:10:23.648 --> 00:10:24.722
Here.

00:10:24.722 --> 00:10:25.704
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:32.890
JOHN DOLHUN: OK.

00:10:32.890 --> 00:10:37.190
So we just figured out how
ferrocene is put together.

00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:39.160
Now we have to make it.

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:44.500
And to make ferrocene
you need cyclopentadiene.

00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:48.520
But this stuff is not
commercially available

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:52.270
because it has a half
life of 12 hours.

00:10:52.270 --> 00:10:55.000
What it does is it
spontaneously adds

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.680
to itself in this reverse
Diels-Alder type reaction

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:01.810
to make the dimer.

00:11:01.810 --> 00:11:04.960
So let's look at the Diels-Alder
reaction for a moment.

00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:11.430
If you're taking
organic now, this

00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:16.860
is the Mona Lisa of all organic
reactions discovered by Otto

00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:20.130
Diels and Kurt Alder in 1928.

00:11:20.130 --> 00:11:23.730
And they both won the
Nobel Prize in 1950.

00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:26.970
You need a diene--

00:11:26.970 --> 00:11:29.940
an unsaturated hydrocarbon
with two double bonds--

00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:31.110
and a dienophile--

00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:36.690
a substituted alkene-- to make
this substituted cyclohexene

00:11:36.690 --> 00:11:38.520
type derivative.

00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:41.370
What you've got is
four pi electrons here,

00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:44.340
two pi electrons here,
and this is called

00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:48.000
a 4 plus 2 cyclo addition.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.310
And this reaction just goes.

00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:53.310
You don't have to do it.

00:11:53.310 --> 00:11:54.930
You put them
together and it goes

00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:58.020
because you're making
these sigma bonds, which

00:11:58.020 --> 00:12:01.470
are much more energetically
stable than the pi

00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:03.550
bonds you're starting with.

00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:05.610
But look at our system.

00:12:05.610 --> 00:12:09.630
We have these two
cyclopentadiene rings.

00:12:09.630 --> 00:12:11.400
We don't have a dienophile.

00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:13.560
We've got two dienes here.

00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:17.640
And this thing still goes
spontaneously-- adds to itself

00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:20.475
to produce the dimer and
other higher polymers.

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:25.850
So how are we
going to make this?

00:12:25.850 --> 00:12:30.650
We're going to crack the
dicyclopentadiene in the hood.

00:12:30.650 --> 00:12:33.480
The TAs are going
to do this for you.

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:35.420
It's highly flammable--
the product.

00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:37.640
Cyclopentadiene is
highly flammable

00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:40.130
so they're going
to cool it in ice.

00:12:40.130 --> 00:12:43.370
The other thing is,
this is very smelly.

00:12:43.370 --> 00:12:47.960
So don't wear your silk clothes
and your wool clothes to lab

00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:50.327
when you're making this stuff.

00:12:50.327 --> 00:12:52.160
So you're going to be
going over to the hood

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:54.650
to get your allocation.

00:12:54.650 --> 00:12:56.330
The main thing you
have to be aware of

00:12:56.330 --> 00:12:58.790
is when you get your
needle and you put it in

00:12:58.790 --> 00:13:00.650
and you pull your 0.3 mLs--

00:13:00.650 --> 00:13:03.440
whatever you need for
your reaction vessel--

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:07.070
that you don't grab on to
the syringe with your fingers

00:13:07.070 --> 00:13:08.820
because the warmth
of your fingers

00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:11.870
will dimerize this
right in the syringe

00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:14.450
before you inject it into
your reaction vessel.

00:13:17.070 --> 00:13:20.310
We're going to heat this
up to about 180 degrees,

00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:24.480
collect the fraction that comes
over between 38 and 41 degrees.

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:29.100
That's our cyclopentadiene.

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:31.800
Now we're going
to be using no air

00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:35.610
techniques in some of the
experiments that we're doing.

00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:38.790
Why do you think we need
to use no air techniques?

00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:41.980
Yes?

00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:42.860
Alex?

00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:44.293
AUDIENCE: There are things
in the air like oxygen

00:13:44.293 --> 00:13:45.010
that are reactive.

00:13:45.010 --> 00:13:45.968
JOHN DOLHUN: Very good.

00:13:45.968 --> 00:13:49.480
There's oxygen in the air
that's very reactive so some

00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:54.400
of the chemicals you're using
like iron chloride tetrahydrate

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:56.620
could be oxidized.

00:13:56.620 --> 00:14:03.170
We've also got that
cyclopentadienide anion here,

00:14:03.170 --> 00:14:05.470
which--

00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:10.510
this guy-- which actually
decomposes in the air.

00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:13.780
So it's very important
to have this atmosphere.

00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:15.310
So how are you going to do that?

00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:17.030
Pretty simple.

00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:19.210
We're going to be working
with these little vessels.

00:14:19.210 --> 00:14:20.950
They're called Assem vials.

00:14:20.950 --> 00:14:23.240
They have septums on them.

00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:27.040
So you'll put your
reactants in there.

00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:30.840
And then you'll simply
take a vent needle,

00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:33.720
put a vent needle
in into the septum.

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:36.570
Don't push the vent
needle down too far.

00:14:36.570 --> 00:14:39.270
If you push it down
too far, your liquid

00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:41.880
might shoot up through
the vent needle.

00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:44.470
Then you're going to
go over to the hood.

00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:47.050
You're going to pull
out the nitrogen line.

00:14:47.050 --> 00:14:49.520
Nitrogen will be flowing.

00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:52.040
You'll stick the
nitrogen line in.

00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:54.590
Now you're bubbling nitrogen in.

00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:57.530
And this can go down
into the liquid, bubble,

00:14:57.530 --> 00:14:59.240
get it refreshed.

00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:02.540
Then you're pushing out the
air through the vent needle.

00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:07.570
After a couple of minutes,
take the vent needle out.

00:15:07.570 --> 00:15:09.910
And then pull out
the nitrogen line.

00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:12.440
Now you effectively have
a nitrogen atmosphere

00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:13.190
for your reaction.

00:15:22.070 --> 00:15:26.500
So this is the reaction scheme
for the synthesis of ferrocene.

00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:29.800
Notice there are two
reactions going on here.

00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:33.670
You'll actually have two
of these little asam vials.

00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:39.190
In one of them you're going to
have KOH and dimethoxyethane.

00:15:39.190 --> 00:15:42.737
The KOH you'll have to mass
out at the balance area.

00:15:42.737 --> 00:15:44.320
And you've got to
work kind of quickly

00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:48.100
with this because KOH
is very hygroscopic.

00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:50.800
It picks up water very quickly.

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:52.660
In the other vessel
you're going to put

00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:57.100
iron chloride tetrahydrate
dimethyl sulfoxide.

00:15:57.100 --> 00:16:00.640
And then you're going
to shake those vessels.

00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:03.250
You're going to
work out in the lab.

00:16:03.250 --> 00:16:08.800
You seriously-- you will be
sore after this lab for about

00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:10.780
an hour of working out.

00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:14.590
Once you shake them well, your
iron chloride tetrahydrate

00:16:14.590 --> 00:16:16.180
should dissolve.

00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:18.850
But the KOH will not dissolve.

00:16:18.850 --> 00:16:21.250
So don't worry about that.

00:16:21.250 --> 00:16:22.390
Do you see KOH?

00:16:22.390 --> 00:16:24.490
It's OK.

00:16:24.490 --> 00:16:26.080
Once you get
everything dissolved

00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:28.390
you take your iron chloride--

00:16:28.390 --> 00:16:33.640
or your KOH dimethoxyethane
vessel over to the hood and you

00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:38.550
get your cyclopentadienide
and you inject it.

00:16:38.550 --> 00:16:41.970
You put that back under
an inert atmosphere.

00:16:41.970 --> 00:16:44.490
And then you start
shaking it some more.

00:16:44.490 --> 00:16:48.480
After about five minutes you
have this beautiful pink color,

00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:51.930
which is your
cyclopentadienide anion--

00:16:51.930 --> 00:16:59.030
sometimes called the Cp ligand
that's forming in your flask.

00:16:59.030 --> 00:17:01.040
Let's just stand
back for a moment

00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:04.040
and take a look at
that top reaction.

00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:09.349
Who can tell me the driving
force of that reaction?

00:17:09.349 --> 00:17:10.650
Why does that reaction go?

00:17:10.650 --> 00:17:11.150
Alex?

00:17:11.150 --> 00:17:13.000
AUDIENCE: It's an
acid base reaction.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:14.920
JOHN DOLHUN: It's an
acid base reaction.

00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:15.460
Yeah.

00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:17.950
Yeah.

00:17:17.950 --> 00:17:23.240
What else up there do you see
that just pushes that so fast?

00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:23.740
Alex?

00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:25.000
AUDIENCE: Resonance.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:25.960
JOHN DOLHUN: Resonance.

00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:26.470
OK.

00:17:26.470 --> 00:17:26.970
Yeah.

00:17:26.970 --> 00:17:29.810
You're making something
that has resonance forms.

00:17:29.810 --> 00:17:30.310
Yes?

00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:31.913
AUDIENCE: Creating
the aromatic ring.

00:17:31.913 --> 00:17:33.080
JOHN DOLHUN: Giselle, right?

00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:33.663
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:17:33.663 --> 00:17:34.372
JOHN DOLHUN: Yes.

00:17:34.372 --> 00:17:35.930
You're creating
an aromatic ring.

00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:36.970
Very good.

00:17:36.970 --> 00:17:39.760
So you're going from
a non aromatic system

00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:42.040
to an aromatic system.

00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:44.100
That is a big push.

00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:45.220
OK.

00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:48.838
So once you make this, then
what you're going to do

00:17:48.838 --> 00:17:51.130
is you're going to take your
other vessel with the iron

00:17:51.130 --> 00:17:54.880
chloride dimethyl
sulfoxide and you're

00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:56.620
going to start doing injections.

00:17:56.620 --> 00:18:01.840
You're going to do four
injections into this system.

00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:04.750
After each injection--
when I did this

00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:09.120
I usually put my system back
under an inert atmosphere.

00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:10.290
And then I'd shake it.

00:18:10.290 --> 00:18:12.240
Then I'd do another injection.

00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:13.770
Shake it.

00:18:13.770 --> 00:18:16.540
Inert atmosphere and so on.

00:18:16.540 --> 00:18:20.250
And then finally, what you've
made is you made ferrocene.

00:18:20.250 --> 00:18:26.210
So once you get down
here you're ready to take

00:18:26.210 --> 00:18:27.530
a look at that ferrocene.

00:18:27.530 --> 00:18:30.620
So what you're going
to need is you're

00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:33.590
going to need a small beaker--

00:18:33.590 --> 00:18:34.970
about a 30 mL beaker.

00:18:38.790 --> 00:18:41.880
And then you half
fill it with ice.

00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:45.660
So we're going to have
ice in the beaker.

00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:47.640
And you're going to
add to the beaker

00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:52.550
about 4.5 mols of 6 molar HCl.

00:18:55.060 --> 00:19:00.370
And then you'll add your
ferrocene from your asam vial.

00:19:00.370 --> 00:19:01.990
You're going to
add your ferrocene.

00:19:06.330 --> 00:19:10.620
And when you do that, you
stir it up with your stir bar.

00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:13.680
And you can use a little bit
of dimethoxyethane methane

00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:16.110
to wash out your asam vial.

00:19:16.110 --> 00:19:19.410
Get everything out, washed
out into that beaker.

00:19:19.410 --> 00:19:23.390
And your orange crystals
should float to the top.

00:19:23.390 --> 00:19:25.810
Once you get your
orange crystals,

00:19:25.810 --> 00:19:28.780
you're going to set up a
little mini Buchner funnel

00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:31.590
system such as this.

00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:36.530
And inside of this there's a
baby piece of filter paper.

00:19:36.530 --> 00:19:40.400
You want to be sure that
you wet this filter paper

00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:41.570
and put it in wet.

00:19:41.570 --> 00:19:44.630
Otherwise if you
don't, if it's dry,

00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:48.540
your product will go under
it and end up in the flask.

00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:51.140
So wet the filter paper,
pour your product in.

00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:53.840
This is hooked up to
the vacuum in the lab.

00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:57.200
And it will just
draw your product

00:19:57.200 --> 00:20:00.640
and you'll have your
filtrate will come through.

00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:02.320
Now the filtrate
that's coming through

00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:06.280
is going to be a
bluish green color.

00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:08.200
What do you think the
filtrate could be?

00:20:12.860 --> 00:20:14.580
Anyone?

00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:18.230
I know you know Alex.

00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:20.750
Anyone else?

00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:21.830
Alex, go for it.

00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:23.510
AUDIENCE: Iron 3.

00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:24.740
JOHN DOLHUN: Iron 3.

00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:27.410
Oxidized ferrocene.

00:20:27.410 --> 00:20:28.250
Interesting.

00:20:31.570 --> 00:20:38.580
So you actually
started with ferrocene.

00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:48.540
And in the process
of oxidation--

00:21:02.210 --> 00:21:04.310
and you've got
some HCl in there.

00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:06.920
So you've got chloride there.

00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:08.990
So what we've made
here is-- you've

00:21:08.990 --> 00:21:16.495
made what's called
ferrocenium chloride.

00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:24.920
Why do you think we made that?

00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:26.240
What does that represent?

00:21:39.930 --> 00:21:43.230
Looks like we lost
some ferrocene probably

00:21:43.230 --> 00:21:47.130
because we didn't
keep that right inert

00:21:47.130 --> 00:21:50.140
atmosphere all along the way.

00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:54.960
So think about how
you would take this

00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:57.780
and get ferrocene back from it.

00:21:57.780 --> 00:22:00.730
I'll let you think
about that a little bit.

00:22:00.730 --> 00:22:02.650
If anybody comes up
with a great idea

00:22:02.650 --> 00:22:07.070
and wants to do this on day four
when there's no lab going on,

00:22:07.070 --> 00:22:09.450
let me know what you need.

00:22:09.450 --> 00:22:09.950
OK?

00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:17.000
So now, we've made
our ferrocene.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:20.300
We've got our crude ferrocene
and we're going to purify it.

00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:24.080
And we're going to
purify it by sublimation.

00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:28.370
Definition of sublimation is the
amount of energy and kilojoules

00:22:28.370 --> 00:22:32.660
per mole that we need to
add to one mole of a solid

00:22:32.660 --> 00:22:37.410
to take it from the solid
to the gas directly.

00:22:37.410 --> 00:22:40.860
Hess's Law defines the
enthalpy of sublimation

00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:47.080
as the enthalpy of melting plus
the enthalpy of vaporization.

00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:50.320
But for this to hold,
both of these steps

00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:53.800
would have to be taking place
at the same temperature,

00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:57.520
otherwise Hess's Law is
just an approximation.

00:22:57.520 --> 00:23:02.490
I brought some
carbon dioxide in.

00:23:02.490 --> 00:23:04.440
Can you see this?

00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:06.120
It's subliming.

00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:08.220
It's going from the solid--

00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:10.110
and this is very cold stuff.

00:23:10.110 --> 00:23:12.480
This is about minus 78 degrees.

00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:13.620
I'm going to burn my hands.

00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:15.750
So I'm doing this very quickly.

00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:16.830
OK.

00:23:16.830 --> 00:23:20.470
You can't see the sublimation
when it gets into the air.

00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:23.020
But I'm going to put
it in this cylinder

00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:26.930
so you can actually see the
bubbles of sublimation that

00:23:26.930 --> 00:23:28.271
are taking place.

00:23:28.271 --> 00:23:28.896
AUDIENCE: Woah.

00:23:28.896 --> 00:23:29.396
Cool.

00:23:33.250 --> 00:23:38.010
JOHN DOLHUN: So there's another
definition of sublimation

00:23:38.010 --> 00:23:40.780
that we can use.

00:23:40.780 --> 00:23:45.390
We can define it as heating a
solid below its triple point

00:23:45.390 --> 00:23:51.350
to the gas and then collecting
that vapor on a cold surface.

00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:53.100
And that's exactly
what you're going to do

00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:55.800
with your crude ferrocene.

00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:59.020
You're going to take a
biological culture dish,

00:23:59.020 --> 00:24:01.920
sprinkle some of your
ferrocene in there,

00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:06.360
cover it, put it on a hot
plate, and then fill up

00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:09.100
a beaker with ice.

00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:11.640
Put the beaker on top of it.

00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:14.280
Turn the heat on.

00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:16.860
Keep it under 100 degrees.

00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:20.550
And after a few minutes, you'll
see orange ferrocene start

00:24:20.550 --> 00:24:25.230
to sublime up inside
of the culture dish.

00:24:25.230 --> 00:24:28.890
And then your crystals
will form on the bottom

00:24:28.890 --> 00:24:33.220
of the cold part of the
dish and hang off the dish.

00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:35.580
It's quite a dramatic reaction.

00:24:35.580 --> 00:24:38.640
And this sublimation
is really great

00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:43.320
because oftentimes the things
that you're trying to purify

00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:48.250
are more volatile than the
impurities that they contain.

00:24:48.250 --> 00:24:52.350
So it's very clean to
actually get a pure substance

00:24:52.350 --> 00:24:53.490
from sublimation.

00:24:57.740 --> 00:25:02.360
Couple precautions-- when
this reaction is over,

00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:06.980
if you take your beaker like
this and you lift it up,

00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:08.900
you're going to lose
all your product.

00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:10.100
It'll fall right off.

00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:11.970
You'll have to start over.

00:25:11.970 --> 00:25:17.180
So the trick is to slide
the beaker off very gently.

00:25:17.180 --> 00:25:19.760
The other thing you
don't want to do

00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:23.620
is you don't want open
this dish when it's hot.

00:25:23.620 --> 00:25:26.480
Why wouldn't we want
to this when it's hot?

00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:26.980
Alex?

00:25:26.980 --> 00:25:28.030
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:28.030 --> 00:25:28.780
JOHN DOLHUN: Yeah.

00:25:28.780 --> 00:25:31.600
The toxic ferrocene would
go up all around us.

00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:32.810
We'd be breathing again.

00:25:32.810 --> 00:25:35.200
So keep this closed
till it's cool.

00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:37.570
Then open it up, scrape
your crystals off.

00:25:41.950 --> 00:25:45.130
So now, you've made
your ferrocene.

00:25:45.130 --> 00:25:50.813
So what we'd like to do is
we'd like to write a reaction.

00:25:50.813 --> 00:25:52.230
And then you're
going to calculate

00:25:52.230 --> 00:25:55.260
the limiting reagent,
the theoretical yield

00:25:55.260 --> 00:25:57.690
from your starting materials.

00:25:57.690 --> 00:26:02.370
You'll take your actual yield
and calculate a percent yield.

00:26:02.370 --> 00:26:03.480
Let's just do a--

00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:06.210
just to review-- a
general equation for that.

00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:13.460
We'll do 2A plus B
going to C plus D.

00:26:13.460 --> 00:26:25.060
And we're going to have 0.9
moles of A and 0.5 moles of B.

00:26:25.060 --> 00:26:29.200
And I want to know how much
C can be formed theoretically

00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:32.310
from my starting materials.

00:26:32.310 --> 00:26:35.340
First thing to do is
look at the equation.

00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:38.220
The equation is talking to you.

00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:39.960
What is it saying?

00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:45.320
It says for every 2A I
need one B. All right.

00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:48.730
How much B do I have?

00:26:48.730 --> 00:26:49.540
0.5.

00:26:49.540 --> 00:26:52.550
So how much A do I need?

00:26:52.550 --> 00:26:54.020
1.

00:26:54.020 --> 00:26:55.580
I don't have enough.

00:26:55.580 --> 00:26:58.320
That's your limiting reagent.

00:26:58.320 --> 00:26:58.820
Right?

00:26:58.820 --> 00:27:00.740
It's going to run out
before anything else.

00:27:00.740 --> 00:27:07.250
So A is going to
determine your product.

00:27:07.250 --> 00:27:10.180
So now again, take a
look at the equation.

00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:11.440
It's talking.

00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:16.650
For every 2A, you
make one C. How much

00:27:16.650 --> 00:27:21.050
C am I going to make
from 0.9 moles of A?

00:27:21.050 --> 00:27:21.950
0.45.

00:27:21.950 --> 00:27:23.150
Very good.

00:27:23.150 --> 00:27:40.360
So my theoretical yield is
going to be 0.45 moles of C.

00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:43.030
Now what you can do
now is you're going

00:27:43.030 --> 00:27:44.890
to actually do the reaction.

00:27:44.890 --> 00:27:47.170
You'll mass out how
much you actually

00:27:47.170 --> 00:27:51.010
got so you'll know what
your actual yield is.

00:27:51.010 --> 00:27:56.200
So you can calculate
a percent yield,

00:27:56.200 --> 00:28:10.060
which is your actual over
your theoretical times 100.

00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:12.020
Pretty simple.

00:28:12.020 --> 00:28:14.830
You're also going to have to
determine the melting point

00:28:14.830 --> 00:28:17.160
of the ferrocene.

00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:20.070
And I'm going to tell you that
if you take your melting point

00:28:20.070 --> 00:28:24.150
tube and you stick it in
the melt temp and you're

00:28:24.150 --> 00:28:31.190
watching it, you'll never see
it melt. Think about that.

00:28:31.190 --> 00:28:33.200
Think about what
you're going to have

00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:37.310
to do before you put
that melting tube

00:28:37.310 --> 00:28:40.780
into the melting point
machine because you

00:28:40.780 --> 00:28:42.220
know ferrocene sublimes.

00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:43.300
Right?

00:28:43.300 --> 00:28:46.020
Just going to disappear on you.

00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:46.860
Think about that.

00:28:50.540 --> 00:28:54.010
So now we are going
to take our ferrocene

00:28:54.010 --> 00:28:56.980
and we're going to
do a Friedel-Crafts

00:28:56.980 --> 00:29:01.420
electrophilic aromatic
substitution reaction.

00:29:01.420 --> 00:29:03.140
We're going to
take the ferrocene

00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:05.890
and we're going
to a acetylate it.

00:29:05.890 --> 00:29:09.610
And normally this
Friedel-Crafts reaction

00:29:09.610 --> 00:29:13.840
is usually done with a
very strong Lewis acid.

00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:16.750
Usually they use
aluminum chloride.

00:29:16.750 --> 00:29:21.150
But aluminum chloride is
very difficult to work with.

00:29:21.150 --> 00:29:24.100
You take that stuff and
you're walking around with it

00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:25.090
in the lab.

00:29:25.090 --> 00:29:28.520
It's producing
hydrochloric acid gas.

00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:31.510
So it reacts with the
water vapor in the air.

00:29:31.510 --> 00:29:32.620
It's nasty.

00:29:32.620 --> 00:29:37.450
So we have decided to use a much
weaker Lewis acid-- phosphoric

00:29:37.450 --> 00:29:38.950
acid.

00:29:38.950 --> 00:29:43.630
The good thing is that this
cyclopentadienide anion

00:29:43.630 --> 00:29:46.600
is more reactive than benzene.

00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:51.410
So we can get away with
this weaker Lewis acid.

00:29:51.410 --> 00:29:55.660
So we've got acetic
anhydride phosphoric acid.

00:29:55.660 --> 00:29:58.680
There are no solvents
in this reaction.

00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:02.280
We're reacting these two
things with the ferrocene.

00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:05.220
What do you think the phosphoric
acid is reacting with?

00:30:17.650 --> 00:30:18.620
Anyone?

00:30:18.620 --> 00:30:19.120
Yes?

00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:26.000
AUDIENCE: Is it activating
[INAUDIBLE] carbonyl?

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:27.890
JOHN DOLHUN: Yes.

00:30:27.890 --> 00:30:29.690
It's actually
activating something

00:30:29.690 --> 00:30:33.710
to produce an electrophile,
which is good.

00:30:33.710 --> 00:30:36.720
And that's what we
need for this reaction.

00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:40.370
So it's actually reacting
with the acetic anhydride.

00:30:40.370 --> 00:30:41.960
And here it is here.

00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:43.850
You can see the
mechanism of this.

00:30:43.850 --> 00:30:45.020
Pretty simple.

00:30:45.020 --> 00:30:48.380
The acetic anhydride
phosphoric acid react.

00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:51.930
And you make acetic acid--

00:30:51.930 --> 00:30:53.310
vinegar.

00:30:53.310 --> 00:30:54.450
That's one of the products.

00:30:54.450 --> 00:30:59.280
And then you also make this
very stable acylium ion.

00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:06.300
And this acylium
ion is actually--

00:31:15.950 --> 00:31:18.540
it's resonance stabilized.

00:31:18.540 --> 00:31:21.080
So we can actually take
a pair of electrons

00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:25.400
from oxygen, come
down here, and we

00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:31.580
can throw the positive charge
out onto the oxygen here.

00:31:34.370 --> 00:31:36.680
This is a very stable system.

00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:40.580
This is your active electrophile
for this electrophilic aromatic

00:31:40.580 --> 00:31:42.530
substitution.

00:31:42.530 --> 00:31:46.640
It's your carbonium ion.

00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:49.200
So here we've got
the carbonium ion.

00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:51.380
And here's our
cyclopentadienide--

00:31:51.380 --> 00:31:53.030
the carbanion.

00:31:53.030 --> 00:31:57.560
And this carbanion literally
throws its electron density out

00:31:57.560 --> 00:32:01.490
to that a acylium
ion and captures it

00:32:01.490 --> 00:32:04.220
by the normal steps of
electrophilic aromatic

00:32:04.220 --> 00:32:05.510
substitution.

00:32:05.510 --> 00:32:07.670
You're just substituting
an electrophile

00:32:07.670 --> 00:32:09.800
for a hydrogen on the ring.

00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:14.100
And you potentially can
make these two products.

00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:16.340
So what you've
got here is you've

00:32:16.340 --> 00:32:18.920
got-- you either could
make the monoacetylated

00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:20.310
or the diacetylated.

00:32:23.790 --> 00:32:26.780
Now after you see
this mechanism--

00:32:26.780 --> 00:32:30.160
let's go back here
one more time.

00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:33.490
Why can't we put more than
one of these acyl groups

00:32:33.490 --> 00:32:35.230
on these rings?

00:32:35.230 --> 00:32:38.260
Why can we only make
the mono and the di

00:32:38.260 --> 00:32:40.000
as potential products?

00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:47.740
Yes?

00:32:47.740 --> 00:32:48.800
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:54.020 --> 00:32:56.170
JOHN DOLHUN: Very good.

00:32:56.170 --> 00:32:59.980
The acyl group is an
electron withdrawing.

00:32:59.980 --> 00:33:03.580
So if you can imagine these
groups pulling electrons away

00:33:03.580 --> 00:33:08.830
from the ring, it's creating all
these positive positions here.

00:33:08.830 --> 00:33:11.120
And the electrophile
is positive.

00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:13.480
So the electrophiles
would be repelled away

00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:15.250
from the other positions.

00:33:15.250 --> 00:33:17.990
This is a deactivating
group here.

00:33:17.990 --> 00:33:18.490
Great.

00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:27.500
Now we've got our
products, but we'd

00:33:27.500 --> 00:33:30.980
like to know how many
products we've got.

00:33:30.980 --> 00:33:35.582
Did we make the monoacetylated
or the diacetylated?

00:33:35.582 --> 00:33:37.040
So what we're going
to use is we're

00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:40.460
going to use a technique called
thin layer chromatography.

00:33:40.460 --> 00:33:44.050
How many of you have done
thin layer chromatography?

00:33:44.050 --> 00:33:44.730
Oh wow.

00:33:44.730 --> 00:33:45.420
Number of you.

00:33:45.420 --> 00:33:47.040
OK.

00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:51.020
So what we've got is we've
got these little slides.

00:33:51.020 --> 00:33:54.530
They're almost like
microscope slides.

00:33:54.530 --> 00:33:57.920
They have a nice clear
surface on one side.

00:33:57.920 --> 00:34:01.250
On the other side they
have a solid absorbent.

00:34:01.250 --> 00:34:06.500
And the solid absorbants
that we use are alumina--

00:34:10.250 --> 00:34:13.670
Al2O3-- and silica gel--

00:34:18.139 --> 00:34:23.150
SiO2 times x water.

00:34:23.150 --> 00:34:27.750
You notice both of these solid
absorbants have polar bonds.

00:34:27.750 --> 00:34:29.659
You've got AlO bonds here.

00:34:29.659 --> 00:34:32.510
You've got SiO bonds here.

00:34:32.510 --> 00:34:38.600
What that means is the solid
absorbant is going to--

00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:41.929
any polar system that
you put on this plate

00:34:41.929 --> 00:34:46.290
is going to stick to that
solid absorbent more.

00:34:46.290 --> 00:34:48.540
We're also going to
have a mobile phase.

00:34:48.540 --> 00:34:51.989
It's going to carry our
components by capillary action

00:34:51.989 --> 00:34:54.310
up the plate.

00:34:54.310 --> 00:34:57.710
We're going to be spotting
this plate with our product.

00:34:57.710 --> 00:35:00.460
And then we're going to watch
the spots move up the plate

00:35:00.460 --> 00:35:03.880
and separate by partitioning.

00:35:03.880 --> 00:35:06.460
And what does that mean?

00:35:06.460 --> 00:35:10.450
In all of these
chromatic distributions

00:35:10.450 --> 00:35:13.960
it's all about the
distribution of the solute

00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:20.440
between the stationary solid
absorbent and the mobile phase.

00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:26.050
And so you can get this
distribution constant,

00:35:26.050 --> 00:35:31.630
which actually should
be a constant ideally

00:35:31.630 --> 00:35:34.660
over a wide range of
solute concentrations.

00:35:37.420 --> 00:35:41.800
Let's say we had a distribution
constant that was very high.

00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:47.350
What would that mean in terms
of the spot on the plate?

00:35:47.350 --> 00:35:48.340
Yes?

00:35:48.340 --> 00:35:49.572
August?

00:35:49.572 --> 00:35:51.030
AUDIENCE: It wouldn't
move very far

00:35:51.030 --> 00:35:53.260
because most of the material
is the solid [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:53.260 --> 00:35:54.010
JOHN DOLHUN: Good.

00:35:54.010 --> 00:35:56.150
It wouldn't move very
far on this plate.

00:35:56.150 --> 00:35:57.610
It would be sitting
there attached

00:35:57.610 --> 00:35:59.140
to that solid absorbent.

00:35:59.140 --> 00:36:00.640
And if you had a
column and you were

00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:02.170
trying to separate
the material, it

00:36:02.170 --> 00:36:04.850
would move slowly through
that column as well.

00:36:04.850 --> 00:36:05.350
Good.

00:36:08.090 --> 00:36:10.310
So this is what
we're going to do.

00:36:10.310 --> 00:36:15.712
Going to use a little jar like
this to run these TLC plates.

00:36:15.712 --> 00:36:18.410
Let me just get some board here.

00:36:27.550 --> 00:36:29.785
So you are going to
take a TLC plate.

00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:35.720
And about 1 centimeter from
the bottom you're going

00:36:35.720 --> 00:36:40.720
to draw a line with a pencil--

00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:44.650
a straight line-- so use a ruler
because if the line is crooked

00:36:44.650 --> 00:36:47.750
your spots are going to be
going in different directions.

00:36:47.750 --> 00:36:50.382
We have rulers in the stockroom.

00:36:50.382 --> 00:36:51.840
And then what you're
going to do is

00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:56.820
you're going to take a
spatula tip of your ferrocene

00:36:56.820 --> 00:37:01.080
and a spatula tip of
your diacetyl ferrocene.

00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:05.070
And you put them into two
little scintillation vials.

00:37:05.070 --> 00:37:07.118
And you go over to the hood.

00:37:07.118 --> 00:37:08.910
And what you're going
to do is you're going

00:37:08.910 --> 00:37:12.160
to get some dichloromethane.

00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:14.830
And you're going to put a
few drops of dichloromethane

00:37:14.830 --> 00:37:15.790
into your--

00:37:15.790 --> 00:37:18.910
to dissolve your spatula tip.

00:37:18.910 --> 00:37:22.870
And then you'll use the
capillary tube to draw that up.

00:37:22.870 --> 00:37:26.440
And you'll come back and
you'll spot your plate

00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:30.685
with the smallest spot that
you can make and the darkest.

00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:36.870
One of the spots will be-- at
least one will be ferrocene

00:37:36.870 --> 00:37:40.380
and one will be your
acetylated ferrocene mixture.

00:37:40.380 --> 00:37:42.450
That way you can see if
there's any ferrocene

00:37:42.450 --> 00:37:45.510
still inside of your
acetylation product.

00:37:45.510 --> 00:37:49.980
And then you're going
to take tweezers

00:37:49.980 --> 00:37:51.810
and you'll lower
this into the jar.

00:37:55.810 --> 00:37:58.510
You'll have your
solvent in the jar.

00:37:58.510 --> 00:38:01.060
Put about 2 to 3 mLs of solvent.

00:38:01.060 --> 00:38:03.550
Don't put more than 2 to 3 mLs.

00:38:03.550 --> 00:38:07.000
I've seen students
put 5, 10, 15 mLs in.

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:08.410
It's way too much.

00:38:08.410 --> 00:38:11.710
And then when this
goes down into the jar,

00:38:11.710 --> 00:38:17.020
the solvent cannot come up and
touch your spots or your line.

00:38:17.020 --> 00:38:20.800
If it does, you've
got to start over.

00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:23.700
So you'll put it in the jar
and then you'll kind of just

00:38:23.700 --> 00:38:25.470
close it.

00:38:25.470 --> 00:38:26.460
And you'll watch it.

00:38:26.460 --> 00:38:28.950
You'll watch the
solvent move up.

00:38:28.950 --> 00:38:34.080
And then suddenly it's going
to reach up here somewhere.

00:38:34.080 --> 00:38:36.840
Then you pull it out
with your tweezers

00:38:36.840 --> 00:38:39.900
and you draw another
straight line.

00:38:39.900 --> 00:38:41.190
This is the solvent front.

00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:48.640
And what we're
going to do is we're

00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:53.240
going to calculate what's
known as an Rf value.

00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:56.350
It's called a
retardation factor.

00:38:56.350 --> 00:38:58.810
And it's a unitless number.

00:38:58.810 --> 00:39:02.020
You'll measure from the
starting line to the spot

00:39:02.020 --> 00:39:04.720
and then to the
center of the spot

00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:07.450
and the starting line to
the solvent front line.

00:39:07.450 --> 00:39:08.740
You'll divide that.

00:39:08.740 --> 00:39:11.080
You'll get this number.

00:39:11.080 --> 00:39:18.940
Ideally, we would like Rf
values somewhere between 0.15

00:39:18.940 --> 00:39:22.180
and 0.85, which
means that we want

00:39:22.180 --> 00:39:25.060
to get our spots off
the starting line

00:39:25.060 --> 00:39:27.600
but not all the way up to
the solvent front line.

00:39:32.728 --> 00:39:33.895
We have to pick the solvent.

00:39:38.110 --> 00:39:43.100
Let's start out by picking
maybe something non-polar like

00:39:43.100 --> 00:39:44.880
hexane--

00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:46.540
purely non-polar.

00:39:46.540 --> 00:39:47.040
C6H14.

00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:53.640
If we pick hexane
as our eluent, what

00:39:53.640 --> 00:39:58.020
do you think is going to happen
to the polar component that's

00:39:58.020 --> 00:39:59.540
sitting on your line there?

00:40:05.060 --> 00:40:05.900
Who said that?

00:40:05.900 --> 00:40:07.070
Sean?

00:40:07.070 --> 00:40:08.540
It's not going to move at all.

00:40:08.540 --> 00:40:13.550
That's right because it's
affixed to that solid absorbent

00:40:13.550 --> 00:40:14.810
and it's polar.

00:40:14.810 --> 00:40:17.940
It doesn't like this
non-polar solvent.

00:40:17.940 --> 00:40:20.010
So it's going to sit
on the starting line.

00:40:20.010 --> 00:40:22.790
So this would not
be a good choice.

00:40:22.790 --> 00:40:27.440
How about if we pick
something more moderately

00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:30.590
polar like ethyl acetate.

00:40:30.590 --> 00:40:34.820
Here's ethyl acetate.

00:40:34.820 --> 00:40:36.920
So we're going to take this.

00:40:36.920 --> 00:40:40.220
And now we're going to
run the plate with this.

00:40:40.220 --> 00:40:44.840
What's going to happen to
the non-polar component?

00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:45.680
Think about this.

00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:48.890
Now you've got ethyl
acetate for your eluent.

00:40:48.890 --> 00:40:51.740
You've got a polar
solid absorbent

00:40:51.740 --> 00:40:53.540
and your non-polar component.

00:40:53.540 --> 00:40:54.650
What will happen to that?

00:41:03.775 --> 00:41:04.275
Anyone?

00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:12.690
Any of the TAs want
to chime in on this?

00:41:12.690 --> 00:41:13.290
Yes, Sean?

00:41:13.290 --> 00:41:16.092
AUDIENCE: Maybe it's too
close to the solvent front?

00:41:16.092 --> 00:41:16.800
JOHN DOLHUN: Yes.

00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:19.530
It's going to zoom all the
way up to the solvent front.

00:41:19.530 --> 00:41:20.610
Very good, Sean.

00:41:20.610 --> 00:41:23.050
That's exactly what's
going to happen.

00:41:23.050 --> 00:41:25.600
So that wouldn't
be good, would it?

00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:26.995
We want something in between.

00:41:26.995 --> 00:41:28.870
We want to separate
them, but don't want them

00:41:28.870 --> 00:41:31.060
all the way to the solvent
front or don't want them

00:41:31.060 --> 00:41:32.535
off the starting line.

00:41:32.535 --> 00:41:33.910
So here's what
we're going to do.

00:41:39.610 --> 00:41:41.290
What I want you to
do is I want you

00:41:41.290 --> 00:41:51.035
to try a combination of
ethyl acetate and hexane.

00:41:54.090 --> 00:41:57.060
We'll do like a 1:1 mix.

00:41:57.060 --> 00:42:00.600
And then do a 4:1 mix.

00:42:00.600 --> 00:42:03.460
And then try a 1:4 mix.

00:42:03.460 --> 00:42:08.010
I want you to see which
combination gives you the best

00:42:08.010 --> 00:42:11.700
separation on your plate.

00:42:11.700 --> 00:42:15.720
And once you do that,
then we're going to use

00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:17.970
that solvent to run the column.

00:42:17.970 --> 00:42:20.940
TLC is just going to tell
us how many components

00:42:20.940 --> 00:42:22.710
are in our mixture.

00:42:22.710 --> 00:42:25.110
The column will let
us separate them.

00:42:25.110 --> 00:42:28.770
So we're actually going to fill
a column with aluminum oxide

00:42:28.770 --> 00:42:31.400
and collect our fractions.

00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:34.040
Here's a typical column.

00:42:34.040 --> 00:42:39.090
Let's pretend we have ferrocene
and acetyl ferrocene in there.

00:42:39.090 --> 00:42:40.070
One of them is polar.

00:42:40.070 --> 00:42:43.090
One is non-polar.

00:42:43.090 --> 00:42:44.770
Which color is the ferrocene?

00:42:59.730 --> 00:43:00.840
Yes?

00:43:00.840 --> 00:43:01.440
Jesse?

00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:02.340
Yes?

00:43:02.340 --> 00:43:04.140
AUDIENCE: Blue.

00:43:04.140 --> 00:43:05.947
JOHN DOLHUN: That's you, right?

00:43:05.947 --> 00:43:07.530
AUDIENCE: The ferrocene
would be blue.

00:43:07.530 --> 00:43:08.550
JOHN DOLHUN: Ferrocene is blue.

00:43:08.550 --> 00:43:09.050
Good.

00:43:09.050 --> 00:43:11.250
The non-polar is
coming through first

00:43:11.250 --> 00:43:13.530
because it's not bound
to the solid absorbent

00:43:13.530 --> 00:43:15.120
and it's just flowing
right through.

00:43:15.120 --> 00:43:17.910
And you're a acetyl
ferrocene comes after.

00:43:17.910 --> 00:43:19.410
So what you're going
to do is you're

00:43:19.410 --> 00:43:21.370
going to make a mini column.

00:43:21.370 --> 00:43:23.820
Here's an example.

00:43:23.820 --> 00:43:26.970
You're going to fill
this with alumina--

00:43:26.970 --> 00:43:30.690
about 7 to 8 centimeters
of dry alumina.

00:43:30.690 --> 00:43:33.120
And then you're going to
put a little layer of sand

00:43:33.120 --> 00:43:34.530
on top of it.

00:43:34.530 --> 00:43:37.950
About 5 millimeters
or so of sand.

00:43:37.950 --> 00:43:39.540
You can see it here--

00:43:39.540 --> 00:43:41.680
get an idea what to do.

00:43:41.680 --> 00:43:43.860
And then you're
going to dry load

00:43:43.860 --> 00:43:46.750
your sample on top of the sand.

00:43:46.750 --> 00:43:49.230
So how do we dry
load our sample?

00:43:49.230 --> 00:43:50.730
So what you're going
to do is you're

00:43:50.730 --> 00:44:01.320
going to take your
acetylated product,

00:44:01.320 --> 00:44:06.860
take it over to the hood, and
you mix in about 50 milligrams

00:44:06.860 --> 00:44:15.920
of alumina, and then you
get our old friend out--

00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:17.990
dichloromethane.

00:44:17.990 --> 00:44:20.320
This is nasty stuff.

00:44:20.320 --> 00:44:26.320
It causes all kinds of
cancers in animals--

00:44:26.320 --> 00:44:30.560
laboratory animals--
liver, lungs, everything.

00:44:30.560 --> 00:44:32.410
So you've got to-- don't
breathe this stuff.

00:44:32.410 --> 00:44:34.270
We're keeping it under the hood.

00:44:34.270 --> 00:44:40.160
So you add minimal
amount of dichloromethane

00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:44.570
just to get this all
wet and a slurry.

00:44:44.570 --> 00:44:46.610
And then you use a
nitrogen line to air

00:44:46.610 --> 00:44:50.810
dry it to get a nice
powdery air dried product.

00:44:50.810 --> 00:44:52.610
And then you're going
to pour your product

00:44:52.610 --> 00:44:54.200
on top of that top--

00:44:54.200 --> 00:44:56.750
the layer of sand there.

00:44:56.750 --> 00:44:58.970
And then you're going to
put another layer of sand

00:44:58.970 --> 00:45:01.380
on top of your product--

00:45:01.380 --> 00:45:03.390
the final layer.

00:45:03.390 --> 00:45:05.205
And then you're ready to go.

00:45:05.205 --> 00:45:06.580
What you're going
to do is you're

00:45:06.580 --> 00:45:10.570
going to add your solvent
that you picked from TLC that

00:45:10.570 --> 00:45:13.030
gave you the best
separation because we

00:45:13.030 --> 00:45:15.460
want to separate
these components apart

00:45:15.460 --> 00:45:17.510
so we can collect them.

00:45:17.510 --> 00:45:20.638
And the thing to remember is
when you add your solvent,

00:45:20.638 --> 00:45:21.430
you're ready to go.

00:45:21.430 --> 00:45:23.470
Open the stopcock here.

00:45:23.470 --> 00:45:27.170
Otherwise, nothing
is going to flow out.

00:45:27.170 --> 00:45:32.800
And the other thing I suggest
is get a little scintillation

00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:37.120
vials or use the baby
Erlenmeyer flasks

00:45:37.120 --> 00:45:39.700
and make sure you weigh
them and tare them

00:45:39.700 --> 00:45:42.220
before you do this
reaction because you

00:45:42.220 --> 00:45:44.830
may have so little
product it'll be

00:45:44.830 --> 00:45:48.100
very hard for you to scrape it
out to get a weight at the end.

00:45:48.100 --> 00:45:51.310
But if you weigh the
empty vial first,

00:45:51.310 --> 00:45:53.380
then you can weigh it
and get a weight on it

00:45:53.380 --> 00:45:56.560
and you'll know your mess so
you can calculate your yield.

00:46:00.118 --> 00:46:02.160
Some things that can
happen-- if you have bubbles

00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:06.090
in your column, start
over because they're

00:46:06.090 --> 00:46:09.160
going to distort your
bands coming through.

00:46:09.160 --> 00:46:14.680
If you don't keep the solvent
on top of the top layer of sand

00:46:14.680 --> 00:46:16.040
throughout the whole run--

00:46:16.040 --> 00:46:18.760
you have to keep a cushion
of solvent flowing--

00:46:18.760 --> 00:46:20.930
keep it above that
top layer of sand--

00:46:20.930 --> 00:46:22.630
your column will dry out.

00:46:22.630 --> 00:46:25.690
It'll crack and your
bands will flow together.

00:46:25.690 --> 00:46:29.020
It'll make it difficult to
separate the different colored

00:46:29.020 --> 00:46:30.770
bands coming through.

00:46:30.770 --> 00:46:33.880
The other thing is when you
make your column, what I do

00:46:33.880 --> 00:46:37.220
is tap it a little bit each time
you put the sand and alumina

00:46:37.220 --> 00:46:37.720
in.

00:46:37.720 --> 00:46:41.020
Make it level so you don't
have these kind of irregular

00:46:41.020 --> 00:46:45.740
surfaces that can
cause distortions.

00:46:45.740 --> 00:46:48.020
So you're going to take
your melting point,

00:46:48.020 --> 00:46:50.060
calculate your percent
yields, determine

00:46:50.060 --> 00:46:55.130
the mass of the components,
and that's pretty much

00:46:55.130 --> 00:46:57.170
all you need to do for that.

00:46:57.170 --> 00:47:00.950
Now I want to show you what's
happening with ferrocene today.

00:47:00.950 --> 00:47:03.625
This is really something
with what's going on.

00:47:03.625 --> 00:47:04.250
It's been what?

00:47:04.250 --> 00:47:05.600
How many years?

00:47:05.600 --> 00:47:07.940
51-- it's been almost 70 years.

00:47:07.940 --> 00:47:09.110
Right?

00:47:09.110 --> 00:47:09.620
OK.

00:47:09.620 --> 00:47:14.300
Some people have taken the
penicilloic acid shell that

00:47:14.300 --> 00:47:19.320
was synthesized here at MIT
by John Sheehan in the 1950s,

00:47:19.320 --> 00:47:21.860
and they acetylated
it with ferrocene

00:47:21.860 --> 00:47:24.470
making ferrocenyl penicillin.

00:47:24.470 --> 00:47:28.700
And it actually overcomes
some of the resistance that's

00:47:28.700 --> 00:47:31.730
developed by the
penicillin antibiotics that

00:47:31.730 --> 00:47:34.410
have been around for decades.

00:47:34.410 --> 00:47:38.270
Another thing-- someone
has taken tamoxifen--

00:47:38.270 --> 00:47:41.880
breast cancer drug that's
been around for decades.

00:47:41.880 --> 00:47:44.180
It's become resistant
to a lot of the breast

00:47:44.180 --> 00:47:46.790
cancers it's used on.

00:47:46.790 --> 00:47:48.740
They've taken the
phenyl group off here,

00:47:48.740 --> 00:47:51.740
put ferrocene on,
added and OH group,

00:47:51.740 --> 00:47:57.380
and created hydroxy-ferroccifen,
which is also overcoming some

00:47:57.380 --> 00:47:59.240
of the resistant breast cancer.

00:47:59.240 --> 00:48:02.480
It's really incredible.

00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:05.020
This is one of my favorites.

00:48:05.020 --> 00:48:08.460
What's the most vicious
animal on the earth?

00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:14.010
The mosquito.

00:48:14.010 --> 00:48:15.330
Exactly.

00:48:15.330 --> 00:48:19.560
I mean, there are two million
deaths by these mosquitoes

00:48:19.560 --> 00:48:21.390
with malaria every year.

00:48:21.390 --> 00:48:25.020
Chloroquine has been
the source, but it

00:48:25.020 --> 00:48:27.180
was discovered in the '30s.

00:48:27.180 --> 00:48:29.340
So a lot of resistance.

00:48:29.340 --> 00:48:30.030
Right?

00:48:30.030 --> 00:48:31.560
So what they've
done to chloroquine

00:48:31.560 --> 00:48:33.480
is they've taken
the scaffold here

00:48:33.480 --> 00:48:39.840
and they split it and inserted
ferrocene made ferroquine.

00:48:39.840 --> 00:48:41.850
This is our fairy queen.

00:48:41.850 --> 00:48:42.960
That's good.

00:48:42.960 --> 00:48:43.500
Yeah.

00:48:43.500 --> 00:48:48.090
Ferroquine-- this could be
the first organo-metallic

00:48:48.090 --> 00:48:50.220
antibiotic on the market.

00:48:50.220 --> 00:48:53.910
Sanofi Aventis has
pushed this through stage

00:48:53.910 --> 00:48:55.730
two clinical trials.

00:48:55.730 --> 00:48:58.530
I'm not sure where it is now,
but I got this most recent

00:48:58.530 --> 00:48:59.760
paper here.

00:48:59.760 --> 00:49:01.800
So this looks very promising.

00:49:04.500 --> 00:49:09.210
Testosterone dihydrotestosterone
the nemesis of all men

00:49:09.210 --> 00:49:14.670
because the prostate gland, it
grows and then you get cancer.

00:49:14.670 --> 00:49:18.120
All men will get cancer
if you live long enough.

00:49:18.120 --> 00:49:22.200
So what they've done is they've
made ferrocene derivatives

00:49:22.200 --> 00:49:24.600
of these hormones that
block the receptor

00:49:24.600 --> 00:49:28.970
site to stop the growth.

00:49:28.970 --> 00:49:30.810
This is a good one.

00:49:30.810 --> 00:49:32.440
This is just happening.

00:49:32.440 --> 00:49:36.370
They took Sedaxane and
they removed this group

00:49:36.370 --> 00:49:41.500
and attached ferrocene
and created Sedaxicene.

00:49:41.500 --> 00:49:44.800
This is an anti-fungal agent.

00:49:44.800 --> 00:49:48.510
And it's relatively non-toxic.

00:49:48.510 --> 00:49:52.140
And I mean, you know, these
funguses are out of control.

00:49:52.140 --> 00:49:55.140
They've reached
the end of the line

00:49:55.140 --> 00:49:57.880
on these fungicides
that can stop them.

00:49:57.880 --> 00:50:00.030
So this is a great addition.

00:50:00.030 --> 00:50:02.640
I'm not sure where
this is going to go.

00:50:02.640 --> 00:50:08.910
And then here is ferrocene
attached to a zinc complex.

00:50:08.910 --> 00:50:13.770
And this rivals
the drug cisplatin

00:50:13.770 --> 00:50:17.970
in terms of these MCF7
breast cancer cells--

00:50:17.970 --> 00:50:19.890
knocking them knocking them out.

00:50:19.890 --> 00:50:23.730
So there's a lot of good stuff
happening with ferrocene.

00:50:23.730 --> 00:50:27.790
And be sure to take a look at
the safety on the chemicals

00:50:27.790 --> 00:50:28.290
here.

00:50:28.290 --> 00:50:30.690
The TAs will go
over this with you.

00:50:30.690 --> 00:50:34.680
And we'll see you on Thursday
for a very important lecture.

00:50:34.680 --> 00:50:38.760
Probably the most important
lecture in the course--

00:50:38.760 --> 00:50:40.120
how to write a lab report.

00:50:40.120 --> 00:50:41.640
It's all about lab reports.

00:50:41.640 --> 00:50:44.220
And Dr. Sarah Hewett
will be giving that.

00:50:44.220 --> 00:50:46.100
Thank you.

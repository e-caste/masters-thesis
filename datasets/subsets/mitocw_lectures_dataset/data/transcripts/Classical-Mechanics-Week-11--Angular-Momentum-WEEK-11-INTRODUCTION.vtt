00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:04.640
We recently introduced a
vector quantity called torque--

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.060
a sort of rotational
analog to force.

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:09.820
And we saw that an applied
torque changes the angular

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:13.030
motion of a rotating
body in just the same way

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:15.430
that an applied force
changes the linear motion

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:17.830
of a translating body.

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:19.630
This week, we're
going to introduce

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:21.940
the concept of angular
momentum, which

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:24.970
relates to torque and rotational
motion in the same way

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:27.220
that ordinary momentum
relates to force

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.350
and translation of motion.

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:31.810
Like torque, angular
momentum is defined

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:34.810
in terms of a cross product
or a vector product.

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:38.260
Specifically, the angular
momentum vector L for a point

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.950
mass is equal to the
cross product R cross P ,

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:44.860
where R is the position
vector measured from a chosen

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:49.180
reference point and P is the
ordinary momentum vector.

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.330
We will also encounter a
third conservation principle,

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.430
this time for angular momentum.

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:58.460
An applied torque causes the
angle the moment of to change.

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.300
However, if there are no
external torques on a system,

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.950
then the angular
momentum of the system

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:05.780
is conserved or
remains constant.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.070
This is a powerful tool
for solving many problems.

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.430
One subtlety is that
angular momentum like torque

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.310
is defined relative
to a specified point.

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.890
So for a given system,
the angular momentum

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.800
with respect to one
point might be conserved,

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.470
while the angular momentum with
respect to a different point

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:25.030
might be changing.

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.190
Often in analyzing
the system, we

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:29.500
must be careful about our
choice of reference point

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.660
for torques and angular
momentum in order

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:35.560
to take full advantage of
the conservation principle.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.330
Angular momentum
is a particularly

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.789
subtle and non-intuitive
concept in comparison

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:41.470
to momentum and energy.

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.960
And the resulting motion
is often surprising.

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.430
It is worthy of
particularly careful study.

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:25.100
PROFESSOR STRANG: Ready for
the least squares lecture,

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:29.360
lecture 11?

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.840
Homework is just being
posted on the web.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:38.370
It'll be due, it's really
to help you practice, get

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:44.880
some experience on these
sections for the first exam.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.950
That's Tuesday evening.

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.140
So eight days away.

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.750
So the homework will
be due the day after.

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:58.270
And actually, we'll try to move
the review session to Monday

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:02.240
next week so you can ask me any
questions about the homework

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.840
or any review material.

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.630
So that's all a week
away and this week we

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.710
get two great examples.

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.280
Least squares is one
that comes today.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.026
But could I first, because
I keep learning more--

00:01:19.026 --> 00:01:20.900
And I've got your MATLAB
homeworks to return.

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:26.640
I keep sort of learning a little
more from your MATLAB results

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.810
and I think because
we spoke about it,

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.120
it would be worth speaking
just a little more.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:41.030
So I'm going to take ten minutes
about this convection-diffusion

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:46.960
equation in which I put in a
coefficient d, a diffusivity,

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.670
just to help get
the units right.

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.450
So this is your example.

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.840
And it had d=1 of course.

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.290
Well first I realized
that later in the book

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.500
I completely forgot that
I discussed this problem.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.280
About page 509, I think.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.010
I discussed it a little bit.

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:15.120
And just because
it's worth, since we

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.010
invested a little time, the
little bit more will pay off.

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.430
So first of all,
the point is here

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.430
we have convection
competing with diffusion.

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.110
And always there's some
non-dimensional number.

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.290
Here it's called
the Peclet number.

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.810
Actually, there's an accent
on one of those e's, PÃ©clet

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.200
number.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.680
Which measures the ratio,
the importance of convection

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.590
relative to diffusion.

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:52.640
So it's V times a length scale
in the problem, divided by d.

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.180
So then that has the
same units as that,

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.040
if the result is dimensionless.

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.330
Maybe you know the
Reynolds number.

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.200
This is very like the Reynolds
number, which also measures,

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:10.030
in Navier-Stokes equation,
the importance of convection,

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.620
advection, and diffusion.

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.750
There, in that equation,
the velocity V,

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.510
that's a non-linear
equation, Navier-Stokes,

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:28.490
it's tremendously important
and many codes to solve it,

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:33.280
lots of discussion,
theory still not complete.

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.630
In that problem, the V is u.

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:39.600
It's non-linear
and the term there

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.980
that we took as a
constant, as a given

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.510
constant V, it's the same as u.

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:52.200
So in the Reynolds number, this
would be u, a typical velocity

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.940
u, times a typical
length scale, which

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:02.250
would be like one in our zero to
one problem, divided by d or mu

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.240
or nu, whatever number we use.

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.060
So it's like the
Reynolds number.

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.410
And then it's turned
out for this problem

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:15.140
that people also use
a number that gets

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:18.740
called the cell
Peclet number where

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:23.040
the length is taken
to be half the cell

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.780
size, delta x over two.

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:33.020
Let me call that number P. So
that's P. And what's my point?

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:36.630
This equation's important enough
to sort of see a little more

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:40.870
about it than just the
numbers that come out.

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:47.670
So the MATLAB homework,
which you did really well,

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:51.850
set up finite
differences for this.

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:55.700
Right?

00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:01.590
And found the eigenvalues
and solutions.

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:05.460
It's the eigenvalues I want
to say a little more about.

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:16.980
Because you set up a matrix
K over delta x squared and V

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:21.170
times the centered
difference over delta x.

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:30.930
And I guess I call that whole
combination L, and asked you

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:37.310
about the eigenvalues of L. And
you printed them out correctly.

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:43.610
But there's more there than
I think we have understood.

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:47.130
And I want to make some
more comments about that.

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:49.140
Because it's quite important.

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:55.710
And the comments are clearest if
I just reduce to a n equal two.

00:05:55.710 --> 00:06:01.120
So that matrix, well
the off-diagonal part

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:06.240
of that matrix had some
number b and some number c.

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:10.330
Actually we could figure
out what was the b in this.

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:14.310
This produced a minus one,
two, minus one, right?

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:20.360
So part of the b was the minus
one over delta x squared.

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:26.970
And then from this was
a plus V and a one over,

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:28.960
well it's a centered
difference so I

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:31.310
should divide by 2 delta x.

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:32.510
Is that right?

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:37.210
Is that what a typical
off-diagonal thing

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:39.230
in the matrix that
you displayed?

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:42.610
That's what's coming from
the off-diagonal of K.

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:46.080
And this is what's coming
from the centered difference

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:50.030
C. And then what
would this c thing be?

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:54.850
Well the c is below the diagonal
so it's also that minus one

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:56.880
over delta x squared.

00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:00.640
But now this is a difference,
so it's going to be a minus,

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:01.850
right?

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:09.390
I think those would have been
your entries for b and c.

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:12.910
So can we just think first,
what are the eigenvalues

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:14.460
of that matrix?

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:17.610
It's a two by two,
simple problem.

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:20.760
The trace is zero plus zero.

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:23.670
So that the eigenvalues
will be a plus minus pair

00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:25.830
because they have
to add to zero.

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:29.330
And I think that's the
plus minus pair you get.

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:30.510
Let's just check.

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:32.230
What's our other check?

00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:35.255
They will add to zero, the
plus the square root and minus

00:07:35.255 --> 00:07:37.210
the square root.

00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:39.430
And the product of
the two eigenvalues,

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:42.850
lambda_1 times
lambda_2, will be,

00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:45.660
we have one of them is
plus, one with a minus,

00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:48.360
so it'd be minus bc.

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:53.150
And that's correctly
the determinant.

00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:54.680
So it's good.

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:57.930
These are the
correct eigenvalues.

00:07:57.930 --> 00:08:03.430
Now let me ask you about
the signs of b and c.

00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:07.670
If b and c have the same signs,
like maybe even equal, one,

00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:12.180
one, what are the eigenvalues?

00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:15.160
So in that symmetric
case if b and c

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:19.350
are equal the eigenvalues are?

00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:21.040
Right here.

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:25.290
If b and c are equal,
say equal to one,

00:08:25.290 --> 00:08:28.780
the eigenvalues are
plus and minus one.

00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:32.620
But what if the
signs are opposite?

00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:33.980
Everything changes.

00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:37.590
What if b is one
and c is minus one?

00:08:37.590 --> 00:08:40.700
That matrix would then
be a 90 degree rotation.

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:46.020
It would be anti-symmetric if
b was one and c was minus one.

00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:50.290
Our formula is still correct,
but what does it give us?

00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:56.500
If b is one and c is minus
one what have I got here?

00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:57.730
I've got i.

00:08:57.730 --> 00:09:01.070
So the eigenvalues change
from plus and minus one

00:09:01.070 --> 00:09:04.270
in the symmetric case
to plus and minus i

00:09:04.270 --> 00:09:05.820
in the anti-symmetric case.

00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:12.550
And I think that's what you guys
saw at a certain level of V.

00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:16.340
I hope you did because that was
the point about eigenvalues.

00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:20.020
Now you may say, what
about the diagonal?

00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:22.650
Well I claim diagonal
is very simple.

00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:26.240
What's the diagonal?

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:28.275
Now I'm going to allow
myself a diagonal

00:09:28.275 --> 00:09:34.720
and I'm just going to change--
What happens if I have a and a?

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:36.720
Same entry on the diagonal.

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:39.190
What are the eigenvalues now?

00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:40.810
This is just like,
a great chance

00:09:40.810 --> 00:09:43.630
to do some basic
eigenvalue stuff.

00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:47.380
What are the eigenvalues
of that matrix?

00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:50.650
Well I've added a
times the identity.

00:09:50.650 --> 00:09:54.000
I've just shifted
that matrix by a.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.990
So the eigenvalues
all shift by a.

00:09:57.990 --> 00:10:02.020
So the eigenvalues are
now a plus and minus.

00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:06.450
So no big deal.

00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:10.720
So you say that the a is
actually not important,

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:15.540
not the key to this
question of are they real

00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:18.920
or do they go complex.

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:22.360
So the eigenvalues
of this are real when

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:24.770
b and c have the same sign.

00:10:24.770 --> 00:10:29.300
If b and c have the same sign, I
have a square root, no problem.

00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:33.700
When b and c have opposite
sign, what do I get?

00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:35.530
When b and c have
opposite sign, I'm

00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:37.460
taking the square root
of a negative number

00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:38.910
and I've gone complex.

00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:44.560
Do you see that the change
from real eigenvalues, which

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:49.040
gives a nice curve, to
complex eigenvalues,

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:55.380
which gives a very bumpy
curve for the solution,

00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:59.250
just happens when
like, for example,

00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:04.620
b-- Is it b that's going
to go to zero maybe?

00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:10.770
And then beyond that?

00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:14.470
Well this sign is for
sure negative, right?

00:11:14.470 --> 00:11:16.760
So c is staying negative.

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:24.410
And originally for a little
delta x, b is also negative.

00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:31.410
What's happening here?

00:11:31.410 --> 00:11:36.530
I think that the transition
that you I hope observed

00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:39.390
comes when b hits zero.

00:11:39.390 --> 00:11:44.690
When the combination of V and
delta x is such that at b=0 we

00:11:44.690 --> 00:11:50.480
switch from real eigenvalues
to complex eigenvalues.

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:51.510
And when is b=0?

00:11:55.080 --> 00:12:01.690
That's when this negative
guy off the diagonal

00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:04.780
just exactly cancels this one.

00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:09.620
So b is zero when what?

00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:13.610
So if this equals this,
one over delta x squared

00:12:13.610 --> 00:12:17.300
is equal to V over two delta x.

00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:19.480
Let me multiply
both sides by delta

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:23.360
x squared so that I
have a nice one there,

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:28.010
multiplying by delta x squared
will put a delta x up here.

00:12:28.010 --> 00:12:29.820
And what have we discovered?

00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:33.440
This is why I wanted
you to see it.

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:39.610
That the transition comes
when the Peclet number is one.

00:12:39.610 --> 00:12:42.640
So that Peclet number,
that cell Peclet number

00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:47.450
is exactly the point that
we observed of transition

00:12:47.450 --> 00:12:53.930
from real eigenvalues
to complex eigenvalues.

00:12:53.930 --> 00:12:55.510
And that's the transition.

00:12:55.510 --> 00:13:00.300
So it's that combination,
this is the Peclet number,

00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:09.690
cell Peclet number, it's that
combination, P_cell maybe.

00:13:09.690 --> 00:13:13.600
We've done the
computations and now

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:17.700
we gradually get
back to the meaning.

00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:20.480
And I just wanted
to take this step

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:24.890
back to the meaning to see
when do those numbers start

00:13:24.890 --> 00:13:25.960
going complex.

00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:27.660
You may have noticed
or you may not

00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:30.120
have noticed that
it'll happen when

00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:35.460
one of those, when that
upper diagonal changes sign.

00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:40.140
Now you could say, okay
that's the eigenvalues.

00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:44.500
What's the consequences for
the shape of the solution?

00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:47.160
Well, I haven't
figured all that out.

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:50.530
I'd be happy to have some
more thoughts about that.

00:13:50.530 --> 00:13:58.280
But what you noticed, I
think, in the computations is

00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:05.080
if V got too big so that
that P was bigger than one,

00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:10.400
if V got too big, so
convection was dominating

00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:14.130
and our delta x was not
small enough to deal with it,

00:14:14.130 --> 00:14:19.450
you should have seen the
points on the discrete values

00:14:19.450 --> 00:14:22.580
were oscillating instead
of a proper smooth-- I

00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:25.540
mean, the proper,
with a large V,

00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:30.540
the correct solution, I think,
is practically nothing for here

00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:33.200
and then it goes, this
is a really large V,

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:35.290
take V to a thousand
or something.

00:14:35.290 --> 00:14:36.930
It climbs up like mad.

00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:40.020
Here's the halfway
point where the load is.

00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:44.130
And then it goes along here and
then it climbs down like mad

00:14:44.130 --> 00:14:46.890
to satisfy the
boundary condition.

00:14:46.890 --> 00:14:51.790
I didn't know that that's
what would happen for large V.

00:14:51.790 --> 00:14:53.830
What I'm saying is,
and undoubtedly it

00:14:53.830 --> 00:14:56.770
could be understood
physically, so I

00:14:56.770 --> 00:14:58.450
guess what I'm saying
is there's just

00:14:58.450 --> 00:15:05.370
more good stuff in any
computation than purely

00:15:05.370 --> 00:15:06.450
the numbers.

00:15:06.450 --> 00:15:11.050
And this is part of the
good stuff in that example.

00:15:11.050 --> 00:15:12.750
I hope you liked that.

00:15:12.750 --> 00:15:16.160
Because I mean, here you
did the work but then,

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:22.270
to understand it is
frankly still under way.

00:15:22.270 --> 00:15:28.280
More thinking to do.

00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:31.060
That's back to least squares.

00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:35.680
Here's today's lecture.

00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:38.170
So remember where we
started last time.

00:15:38.170 --> 00:15:39.220
Au=b.

00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:40.410
Last time I wrote f.

00:15:40.410 --> 00:15:42.300
I regret it terribly.

00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:43.800
I can't fix it.

00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:45.260
But it's b.

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:49.590
I want b there to be
the right-hand side.

00:15:49.590 --> 00:15:56.670
And I jumped to the equation
that determines the best u.

00:15:56.670 --> 00:16:02.100
There's no exact u because
we've got too many equations.

00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:04.970
You remember the set-up,
we have too many equations.

00:16:04.970 --> 00:16:07.330
There's noise in
the measurements

00:16:07.330 --> 00:16:10.720
and we can't get the
error down to zero.

00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:13.660
There's some error.

00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:17.950
And the best u was
given by that equation

00:16:17.950 --> 00:16:21.120
and we want to say why.

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:26.220
And understand it from
two or three ways.

00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:28.780
Calculus, geometry, everything.

00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:33.600
Can I first, because I love
my little framework here,

00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:36.770
fit it in because it's quite
important, this example

00:16:36.770 --> 00:16:39.130
and then others fit in.

00:16:39.130 --> 00:16:42.090
So u is our unknown as always.

00:16:42.090 --> 00:16:46.660
Then the matrix A in the
problem produces an Au.

00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:53.730
Now two things to
notice about e,

00:16:53.730 --> 00:16:57.055
which, that's the same letter
I used for elongation, here

00:16:57.055 --> 00:16:59.500
it's standing for error.

00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:00.550
Two things to notice.

00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:04.500
One is that the source
term, which is b,

00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:10.910
comes in at this point
of the framework.

00:17:10.910 --> 00:17:16.570
When we had external forces
on springs and on masses

00:17:16.570 --> 00:17:19.080
it came in at this point.

00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:21.380
We had an f there.

00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:23.610
So that's why I'd like to
keep those two separate.

00:17:23.610 --> 00:17:28.160
The b's are like voltage
sources, they come in here.

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:32.820
The f's are will be like current
sources, they'll come in there.

00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:35.590
Actually it's beautiful.

00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:37.530
One more thing to notice.

00:17:37.530 --> 00:17:40.200
A is coming with a minus sign.

00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:45.200
In mechanics, in masses
and springs, we had e=Au.

00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:48.960
Here it's natural
to work with this,

00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:53.110
the error or the residual b-Au.

00:17:53.110 --> 00:17:57.650
And that minus sign
is natural in physics

00:17:57.650 --> 00:18:03.152
and in electrical
engineering and hydraulics,

00:18:03.152 --> 00:18:07.570
you know, flow-- Where's that
minus sign coming from in flow?

00:18:07.570 --> 00:18:11.770
Well, flow goes from the
higher point to the lower.

00:18:11.770 --> 00:18:14.600
Higher voltage to
the lower voltage.

00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:18.320
And that usually
produces that minus sign.

00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:23.520
No big deal, of course.

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:27.720
So that step is fine
with the framework.

00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:32.770
What do we expect
in that middle step?

00:18:32.770 --> 00:18:37.980
So what's our name for the
matrix that goes there?

00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:40.510
Everybody's gotta
know this framework.

00:18:40.510 --> 00:18:42.710
C, right?

00:18:42.710 --> 00:18:46.840
Only I've been taking
unweighted least squares.

00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:52.100
So for unweighted least
squares, C will be the identity.

00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:55.090
And C doesn't show
in our equations.

00:18:55.090 --> 00:18:57.010
So C is the identity
when there are

00:18:57.010 --> 00:19:02.220
no weights, when all the
equations are equally reliable.

00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:05.430
And that's pretty
common, of course.

00:19:05.430 --> 00:19:07.630
But not always.

00:19:07.630 --> 00:19:11.290
And we'll think, okay,
there is a weight e.

00:19:11.290 --> 00:19:20.370
So w, which is Ce, is weighted
errors, you could say.

00:19:20.370 --> 00:19:23.690
So the letter w comes
up appropriately again.

00:19:23.690 --> 00:19:25.270
Weighted errors.

00:19:25.270 --> 00:19:28.060
And then what's
the good weighting?

00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:31.270
May I stay with C equal the
identity for the moment?

00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:33.740
Unweighted least squares,
because that's by far the most

00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:35.700
common.

00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:38.190
And then w and e are the same.

00:19:38.190 --> 00:19:39.370
C is the identity.

00:19:39.370 --> 00:19:42.160
And finally, there's the
last step in our framework

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:45.560
where we always expect
to see A transpose.

00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:47.330
And we do.

00:19:47.330 --> 00:19:48.830
And we have to say why.

00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:51.520
So that's where I
left it last time.

00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:53.550
That this was the picture.

00:19:53.550 --> 00:19:54.880
This is the equation.

00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:59.910
If I had a matrix C, it
would go there and there.

00:19:59.910 --> 00:20:00.600
Right?

00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:06.590
Because I'd have b-Au and then
I'd apply C before A transpose.

00:20:06.590 --> 00:20:11.270
So C would slip in there before
A transpose on both sides.

00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:13.100
So that would,
with the C's there,

00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:17.690
that would be the weighted
least squares equation.

00:20:17.690 --> 00:20:19.840
You see that it would
be A transpose C

00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:26.380
A instead of A transpose A, but
still the main facts are there.

00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:30.850
So where does the
equation come from?

00:20:30.850 --> 00:20:36.260
So one source, one way to get
the equation is from calculus.

00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:42.130
From minimizing,
from minimizing.

00:20:42.130 --> 00:20:45.540
Set a derivative
to zero, calculus.

00:20:45.540 --> 00:20:48.420
And what's the quantity
we're minimizing?

00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:51.260
We're minimizing
that squared error

00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:55.180
because this is least squares.

00:20:55.180 --> 00:20:58.800
We're minimizing this e
transpose e, the length of e

00:20:58.800 --> 00:20:59.530
squared.

00:20:59.530 --> 00:21:01.860
The sum of the
squares of the errors.

00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:06.220
Which is (b-Au)
transpose (b-Au).

00:21:09.230 --> 00:21:13.620
Again I could say where
to slip in the C matrix.

00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:15.920
If there was one, it
would go in there.

00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:19.100
C would go in there,
C would go in there.

00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:20.940
There'd be a C in the equation.

00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:26.850
But let's keep C
to be the identity.

00:21:26.850 --> 00:21:28.120
So I minimized.

00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:29.970
It's a quadratic.

00:21:29.970 --> 00:21:35.400
It's got u's times
u's, so second degree.

00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:38.550
And what's the coefficient
in that second degree part?

00:21:38.550 --> 00:21:44.730
Well, the second degree part is
coming from (Au)^ transpose Au.

00:21:44.730 --> 00:21:45.230
Right?

00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:47.660
This times this is
going to be linear.

00:21:47.660 --> 00:21:50.270
This times this is
going to be linear.

00:21:50.270 --> 00:21:52.940
That times that is just
going to be a constant,

00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:54.290
its derivative is zero.

00:21:54.290 --> 00:21:57.890
But this times
this is altogether,

00:21:57.890 --> 00:22:02.920
that times that is the u
transpose A transpose Au.

00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:04.660
Right?

00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:07.500
So that's the quadratic part.

00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:16.530
And my only point is it's
like our old stiffness matrix.

00:22:16.530 --> 00:22:21.910
We're seeing the matrix
in here is A transpose A.

00:22:21.910 --> 00:22:25.750
In other words,
when I do calculus

00:22:25.750 --> 00:22:32.580
and maybe I'd prefer to see
something than just compute

00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:35.380
away, take derivatives
mechanically.

00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:42.020
So I'm going to leave that
which is done in the text,

00:22:42.020 --> 00:22:44.460
finding the derivative,
setting to zero.

00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:45.520
And what does it give?

00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:48.430
It gives us our equation.

00:22:48.430 --> 00:22:52.430
So that equation will come
when I set the derivatives

00:22:52.430 --> 00:22:54.170
of this thing to zero.

00:22:54.170 --> 00:22:58.080
So that's one totally
okay approach.

00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:02.240
But I like to see
a picture with it.

00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:03.560
I hope that's alright.

00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:06.130
To take the second
approach is to see

00:23:06.130 --> 00:23:11.230
why A transpose w equal zero.

00:23:11.230 --> 00:23:13.350
Why is that?

00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:16.660
What's going on
in that key step?

00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:17.990
This is always the key step.

00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:20.060
This is like the set-up step.

00:23:20.060 --> 00:23:23.320
This is the weighting step
with constants coming in.

00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:26.630
And here's the key step.

00:23:26.630 --> 00:23:28.360
Let's see that.

00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:32.400
So my picture.

00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:39.160
Let me draw that picture again.

00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:45.210
And my example was in
three dimensions, so m=3.

00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:51.700
I've got three equations.

00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:55.110
The matrix A, oh I'm afraid
I don't remember what it was,

00:23:55.110 --> 00:23:56.780
but I think it was
something like 1,

00:23:56.780 --> 00:24:02.610
1, 1; 0, 1, 3,
was that maybe it?

00:24:02.610 --> 00:24:04.950
Just to connect to last time.

00:24:04.950 --> 00:24:12.100
And what I'm now calling b was
the vector [1, 2, 3] was it?

00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:13.680
Or was it not?

00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:15.840
It was [0, 1, 2] maybe?

00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:18.890
That's right?

00:24:18.890 --> 00:24:20.070
And what was the point?

00:24:20.070 --> 00:24:24.320
If I draw the vector b
it goes there somewhere.

00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:27.660
If I draw the first column
of A, it goes here somewhere.

00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:31.480
If I draw the second column
of A, it goes there somewhere.

00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:38.300
And if I draw all
combinations of these columns,

00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:43.310
all combinations of that vector
and that vector, what do I get?

00:24:43.310 --> 00:24:45.670
I get a plane.

00:24:45.670 --> 00:24:47.560
I get a plane.

00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:48.540
There it is.

00:24:48.540 --> 00:24:49.410
That's the plane.

00:24:49.410 --> 00:24:50.440
That's the plane.

00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:52.820
This is from column one.

00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:54.580
Here's column two.

00:24:54.580 --> 00:24:58.860
This plane is the column
plane or column space.

00:24:58.860 --> 00:25:03.230
It's the column
space of A because it

00:25:03.230 --> 00:25:05.600
comes from the columns of A.

00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:08.730
Now what's the point
about this plane?

00:25:08.730 --> 00:25:15.020
The point is that if b is on
the plane then I'm golden.

00:25:15.020 --> 00:25:20.310
If b is on the plane then b is
a combination of the columns,

00:25:20.310 --> 00:25:26.210
that's what the plane is, and
I have a solution to Au=b.

00:25:26.210 --> 00:25:35.440
So b on a plane, b on the
plane means Au=b is solvable.

00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:40.570
And it could happen, of course.

00:25:40.570 --> 00:25:42.510
Like perfect measurements.

00:25:42.510 --> 00:25:46.670
But we can't expect it.

00:25:46.670 --> 00:25:50.190
When we have three measurements
or 100 measurements or 10,000

00:25:50.190 --> 00:25:53.390
measurements we can't
expect perfection.

00:25:53.390 --> 00:25:56.780
So usually b will
be off the plane.

00:25:56.780 --> 00:25:57.810
Now what?

00:25:57.810 --> 00:25:59.860
What happens when
b is off the plane?

00:25:59.860 --> 00:26:01.710
Let me just complete
that picture.

00:26:01.710 --> 00:26:06.670
And you know what's coming.

00:26:06.670 --> 00:26:15.490
If we're going to get-- Au or Au
hat is going to be on the plane

00:26:15.490 --> 00:26:19.080
so I'm looking for
the best u hat.

00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:22.090
Can I just erase
this to make space

00:26:22.090 --> 00:26:25.560
for what you know
I'm going to draw?

00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:28.910
Here are these little columns,
let me put them there.

00:26:28.910 --> 00:26:31.400
What am I going to draw?

00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:32.830
The projection.

00:26:32.830 --> 00:26:33.710
The projection.

00:26:33.710 --> 00:26:36.170
I'm going to draw,
what's the projection?

00:26:36.170 --> 00:26:38.370
The projection is
the nearest point

00:26:38.370 --> 00:26:42.530
that is in the plane to the
b that's not in the plane.

00:26:42.530 --> 00:26:45.340
So here's the projection p.

00:26:45.340 --> 00:26:47.350
I drop down this thing.

00:26:47.350 --> 00:26:50.710
There's the projection
p, little p.

00:26:50.710 --> 00:26:53.830
That's the projection
of b onto the plane.

00:26:53.830 --> 00:26:58.210
I think your mind says yeah,
that's the right choice.

00:26:58.210 --> 00:27:03.000
And do you want to
tell me what this?

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.610
That is the part that
we can't deal with.

00:27:06.610 --> 00:27:09.120
The part we can't improve.

00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:13.230
We've made it as small
as we could and it's e.

00:27:13.230 --> 00:27:18.700
That's the error e and
this p is the best guy

00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:20.250
that is in the plane.

00:27:20.250 --> 00:27:24.350
Do you see that
this is the picture.

00:27:24.350 --> 00:27:27.330
You get an actual picture
of what's going on.

00:27:27.330 --> 00:27:31.150
You're splitting b,
the measurements,

00:27:31.150 --> 00:27:36.820
into the part you can deal with,
the projection, the Au hat that

00:27:36.820 --> 00:27:38.250
is in the column space.

00:27:38.250 --> 00:27:40.280
It is a combination
of the columns.

00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:42.360
Those points do lie
on a line if I'm

00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:43.860
doing straight line fitting.

00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:48.720
And the part that you can't deal
with, the e, the difference,

00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:53.670
b-Au, which is not in the plane.

00:27:53.670 --> 00:27:56.210
And now I'm still looking
for the equations.

00:27:56.210 --> 00:27:56.710
Right?

00:27:56.710 --> 00:27:58.720
I've just named some stuff.

00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:05.270
But I haven't got an
equation for that projection.

00:28:05.270 --> 00:28:08.280
So what's the key fact?

00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:11.940
What's the key fact
in this picture that's

00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:16.930
going to lead me to an
equation for p and e

00:28:16.930 --> 00:28:20.260
and u hat and everything?

00:28:20.260 --> 00:28:27.570
The key fact is that that
dotted line is perpendicular,

00:28:27.570 --> 00:28:29.640
perpendicular to the plane.

00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:31.920
If I'm looking for
the closest point,

00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:36.790
everybody knows project, that's
what projection involves.

00:28:36.790 --> 00:28:37.710
Go perpendicular.

00:28:37.710 --> 00:28:40.480
This is a right angle.

00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:44.560
That e is perpendicular
to the whole plane.

00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:46.520
Not only perpendicular
to p, it's

00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:48.501
perpendicular to
everybody in that plane.

00:28:48.501 --> 00:28:49.000
Right?

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.730
I'm dropping the
perpendicular to the plane.

00:28:51.730 --> 00:28:54.250
Do you accept that?

00:28:54.250 --> 00:28:56.350
Because if you
do, we're through.

00:28:56.350 --> 00:28:59.570
We just write down the
equations for perpendicular

00:28:59.570 --> 00:29:03.060
and we've got what we
want from the picture

00:29:03.060 --> 00:29:06.730
instead of from a calculation.

00:29:06.730 --> 00:29:09.800
So what's the idea?

00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:14.720
So e is perpendicular
to the first column.

00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:18.200
So b in the plane,
we would be golden.

00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:20.920
Let's suppose we're
not in the plane.

00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:26.100
So now we have this 90 degree
angle, this perpendicular

00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:27.700
projection.

00:29:27.700 --> 00:29:31.670
And it tells me that
the first column--

00:29:31.670 --> 00:29:35.000
oh I better name the columns.

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.740
Can I just call this column a_1?

00:29:37.740 --> 00:29:42.490
That first column is a_1 and
the second column is a_2.

00:29:42.490 --> 00:29:46.140
So those two columns,
whatever they are,

00:29:46.140 --> 00:29:51.020
are the guys whose
combinations give us the plane.

00:29:51.020 --> 00:29:54.990
And it's the plane that
we're projecting onto.

00:29:54.990 --> 00:29:56.970
It's the plane of
all combinations

00:29:56.970 --> 00:29:59.150
that comes up here.

00:29:59.150 --> 00:30:01.450
So what's this 90 degree angle?

00:30:01.450 --> 00:30:06.970
It says that a_1 is
perpendicular to p, right?

00:30:06.970 --> 00:30:09.740
Sorry!

00:30:09.740 --> 00:30:11.480
Say that right for me.

00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:17.930
The first equation says that
a_1 and what are perpendicular?

00:30:17.930 --> 00:30:19.590
e, thank you, e.

00:30:19.590 --> 00:30:26.740
So the first equation says
that a_1 transpose e is zero.

00:30:26.740 --> 00:30:33.350
And the second equation says
that a_2 transpose e is zero.

00:30:33.350 --> 00:30:40.300
Those are my two equations.

00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:43.060
I have to convert those
now into matrix language

00:30:43.060 --> 00:30:47.370
because I've done them
two separate-- vector,

00:30:47.370 --> 00:30:48.870
I mean vector
language, and I want

00:30:48.870 --> 00:30:50.700
to get into matrix language.

00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:52.980
But it's easy to do.

00:30:52.980 --> 00:30:58.150
Here I have, look, if
I have two equations,

00:30:58.150 --> 00:31:04.770
let's get a matrix here.

00:31:04.770 --> 00:31:10.530
What's it saying? a_1
transpose and a_2 transpose,

00:31:10.530 --> 00:31:13.310
what are those?

00:31:13.310 --> 00:31:14.870
They're the rows of A transpose.

00:31:14.870 --> 00:31:19.930
So the matrix way to say that
is A transpose e equal zero.

00:31:19.930 --> 00:31:24.060
In other words, this is
saying both at once, right?

00:31:24.060 --> 00:31:27.850
The first row of A
transpose times e

00:31:27.850 --> 00:31:31.140
gives zero, the second row of
A transpose times e is zero.

00:31:31.140 --> 00:31:33.200
So it's A transpose
e equal zero which

00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:40.150
is what we wanted in this case
where w and e are the same.

00:31:40.150 --> 00:31:42.430
Because C is the identity.

00:31:42.430 --> 00:31:45.540
And let's just go one
step further and see.

00:31:45.540 --> 00:31:51.050
That's A transpose
(b-Au hat) is zero.

00:31:51.050 --> 00:32:00.060
Remember this zero
stands for [0, 0], right?

00:32:00.060 --> 00:32:02.120
I wanted to put the
two equations together.

00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:07.010
So I've got two components
on the right-hand side.

00:32:07.010 --> 00:32:09.280
And then I just
plugged in what b is.

00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:11.880
And now everybody
sees it, right?

00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:14.990
Everybody sees that
we've got the picture,

00:32:14.990 --> 00:32:21.620
this 90 degree angle was
the key to these equations.

00:32:21.620 --> 00:32:27.300
Because if I put A transpose
A u hat onto the other side,

00:32:27.300 --> 00:32:34.820
I've got exactly the normal
equations that I wanted.

00:32:34.820 --> 00:32:40.240
We're taking the time
to see the picture

00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:44.610
and the form of the equations.

00:32:44.610 --> 00:32:50.540
Then I can plug in the
numbers, but the thinking

00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:54.950
is where the
equations come from.

00:32:54.950 --> 00:32:57.230
We're there.

00:32:57.230 --> 00:32:59.450
Now what to do next?

00:32:59.450 --> 00:33:03.540
Now we've understood where
the equations come from.

00:33:03.540 --> 00:33:06.910
I didn't go through the steps
of taking the derivatives,

00:33:06.910 --> 00:33:09.420
but that would work.

00:33:09.420 --> 00:33:12.120
Or this picture.

00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:14.220
I love this picture.

00:33:14.220 --> 00:33:17.000
Let me stay with that
a little bit longer.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:19.570
What is u hat?

00:33:19.570 --> 00:33:29.150
Can I just go over here to say,
okay what have we got here?

00:33:29.150 --> 00:33:37.960
We started with Au=b and then we
got the projection was A u hat.

00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:39.650
But now what is u hat?

00:33:39.650 --> 00:33:45.160
I'm just going to assemble
things here. u hat,

00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:47.870
we figured out by
the 90 degree angle,

00:33:47.870 --> 00:33:51.640
comes from this equation,
which is that equation, which

00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:55.780
is A transpose A u
hat equal A transpose

00:33:55.780 --> 00:33:59.320
b, the central equation.

00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:02.720
That's the central equation.

00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:08.740
Now plug in u hat here so I get
a formula for the projection.

00:34:08.740 --> 00:34:11.520
While we're doing all this
stuff we might just as well

00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:13.400
put those two pieces
together and have

00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:15.300
a formula for the projection.

00:34:15.300 --> 00:34:20.810
So it's A times u hat-- I
hope you like this formula.

00:34:20.810 --> 00:34:25.410
It's kind of goofy-looking
but you'll remember it.

00:34:25.410 --> 00:34:27.220
What is u hat?

00:34:27.220 --> 00:34:31.170
The whole point is that
this matrix is good.

00:34:31.170 --> 00:34:34.330
It's square, it's
symmetric, it's invertible,

00:34:34.330 --> 00:34:37.130
we'll have another
word about that.

00:34:37.130 --> 00:34:42.120
And now I'll invert it.

00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:48.470
Times A transpose b.

00:34:48.470 --> 00:34:53.110
That's the goofy formula
that I wanted you to see.

00:34:53.110 --> 00:35:02.870
The projection of vector b onto
these columns of A comes from

00:35:02.870 --> 00:35:09.270
applying this matrix, sometimes
I call it the matrix of four

00:35:09.270 --> 00:35:11.830
A's.

00:35:11.830 --> 00:35:16.440
Now it's worth looking
at that matrix.

00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:19.040
Often I'll call
that matrix capital

00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:22.070
P. It's the projection matrix.

00:35:22.070 --> 00:35:26.120
You give me any vector b, I
multiply it by this matrix

00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:28.380
and I get the projection.

00:35:28.380 --> 00:35:33.610
It's just worth seeing
what this matrix P,

00:35:33.610 --> 00:35:41.830
these four A's, what are
projection matrices like.

00:35:41.830 --> 00:35:45.440
Now first of all,
when I have an inverse

00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:48.700
of a product, any
reasonable person

00:35:48.700 --> 00:35:52.180
would say okay, split
that into A inverse

00:35:52.180 --> 00:35:55.640
times A transpose inverse
and simplify the whole thing.

00:35:55.640 --> 00:35:58.060
And what will happen?

00:35:58.060 --> 00:36:01.670
It's not going to be legal,
but let's just pretend.

00:36:01.670 --> 00:36:05.780
If I split this into A inverse
times A transpose inverse

00:36:05.780 --> 00:36:09.250
and simplify, what
do I get for P?

00:36:09.250 --> 00:36:10.040
Do you see it?

00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:13.350
I'll get A and if
I try to split this

00:36:13.350 --> 00:36:19.930
into that, what do I have here?

00:36:19.930 --> 00:36:22.520
I've got the identity.

00:36:22.520 --> 00:36:23.790
That's the identity.

00:36:23.790 --> 00:36:25.400
That's the identity.

00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:29.370
The result is the identity.

00:36:29.370 --> 00:36:36.240
That doesn't look good,
right? p is not the same as b.

00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:41.880
This matrix cannot be split
into these two pieces.

00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:45.710
A is rectangular,
that's its problem.

00:36:45.710 --> 00:36:49.060
If A was square, oh yeah,
think about the case

00:36:49.060 --> 00:36:50.460
when A is square.

00:36:50.460 --> 00:36:52.270
Suppose m equals n.

00:36:52.270 --> 00:36:54.500
That case'll be included here.

00:36:54.500 --> 00:36:58.510
If m equals n and my matrix
is square and invertible and

00:36:58.510 --> 00:37:01.050
golden then all this works.

00:37:01.050 --> 00:37:04.130
The projection is
the identity matrix.

00:37:04.130 --> 00:37:06.870
And what's with my picture?

00:37:06.870 --> 00:37:09.240
What's my picture
look like in the case

00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:13.090
where A is a square matrix?

00:37:13.090 --> 00:37:14.420
Give it another column.

00:37:14.420 --> 00:37:17.030
Fit this thing by a quadratic.

00:37:17.030 --> 00:37:20.780
So if I was fitting instead
of by a straight line,

00:37:20.780 --> 00:37:23.090
by a quadratic, it
turns out I'd have

00:37:23.090 --> 00:37:29.980
zero squared, one squared and
three squared in that column.

00:37:29.980 --> 00:37:32.790
I'd have a three
by three matrix.

00:37:32.790 --> 00:37:35.960
It comes out to be invertible.

00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:37.850
Now what's going on?

00:37:37.850 --> 00:37:40.370
Now what's my problem Au=b?

00:37:40.370 --> 00:37:49.880
Now suddenly m is still three,
but now n is three. b is?

00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:53.800
And what happened to the
plane? b is in there.

00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:57.800
And now what's there?

00:37:57.800 --> 00:38:01.400
It's now the
combinations of what?

00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:03.490
Why did that plane come in?

00:38:03.490 --> 00:38:05.450
That was the combinations
of two columns.

00:38:05.450 --> 00:38:06.580
But now I've got three.

00:38:06.580 --> 00:38:08.930
The combinations
of three columns,

00:38:08.930 --> 00:38:14.450
those three columns of an
invertible matrix is what?

00:38:14.450 --> 00:38:17.160
Are you with me?

00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:20.490
If I have a three by three
invertible matrix, these three

00:38:20.490 --> 00:38:24.280
columns independent, pointing
off different directions,

00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:31.300
not in a plane, then when I
take the combinations I get?

00:38:31.300 --> 00:38:32.640
I get R^3.

00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:34.000
I get the whole space.

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:35.560
I get everybody.

00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:38.650
Every vector including
this b and any other b

00:38:38.650 --> 00:38:41.150
you want to suggest
will be a combination

00:38:41.150 --> 00:38:42.430
of these three guys.

00:38:42.430 --> 00:38:44.520
So what's my picture here?

00:38:44.520 --> 00:38:49.710
My picture is that plane
grew to be the whole space.

00:38:49.710 --> 00:38:56.350
So what's the projection of b
onto the whole space? b itself.

00:38:56.350 --> 00:38:58.071
And what's the error?

00:38:58.071 --> 00:38:58.570
Zero.

00:38:58.570 --> 00:38:59.230
Good.

00:38:59.230 --> 00:39:01.690
So that's the nice case.

00:39:01.690 --> 00:39:03.360
That's the standard
case that we've

00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:07.790
thought about in the
past when m equalled n.

00:39:07.790 --> 00:39:11.650
In that case P is the identity
and that'd be all true.

00:39:11.650 --> 00:39:14.780
But normally it's not.

00:39:14.780 --> 00:39:17.970
So I want to come
back to this P just

00:39:17.970 --> 00:39:22.780
to mention an
important fact about P.

00:39:22.780 --> 00:39:24.920
And it comes again
from the picture.

00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:26.190
So this is a projection.

00:39:26.190 --> 00:39:31.850
This is what I'm calling
the projection matrix.

00:39:31.850 --> 00:39:34.760
It's the matrix that
does the projection.

00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:36.410
And there it is.

00:39:36.410 --> 00:39:40.310
Four A's in a row
that multiplies b.

00:39:40.310 --> 00:39:42.910
Now here's my little question.

00:39:42.910 --> 00:39:46.910
So linear algebra's full
of these different kinds

00:39:46.910 --> 00:39:49.300
of matrices.

00:39:49.300 --> 00:39:53.630
Rotations, reflections,
symmetric matrices,

00:39:53.630 --> 00:39:58.830
Markov matrices, so it's just
every problem has matrices.

00:39:58.830 --> 00:40:01.160
Now here we have a
projection matrix.

00:40:01.160 --> 00:40:07.010
Now what I want to know is what
happens if I project again?

00:40:07.010 --> 00:40:10.900
If I take the vector b,
any vector b, I project it

00:40:10.900 --> 00:40:13.090
and then I project again.

00:40:13.090 --> 00:40:18.820
So project twice and just tell
me, you know what will happen.

00:40:18.820 --> 00:40:21.630
I'm back to this picture.

00:40:21.630 --> 00:40:26.580
I project b to P and
now I project again.

00:40:26.580 --> 00:40:28.950
Where do I go?

00:40:28.950 --> 00:40:31.490
Same place, right?

00:40:31.490 --> 00:40:33.670
Once I'm in the
plane the projection

00:40:33.670 --> 00:40:35.270
stays right where it is.

00:40:35.270 --> 00:40:36.880
So what does that tell me?

00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:44.840
That tells me that P squared
on b is the same as P on b.

00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:47.700
If I project twice, no change.

00:40:47.700 --> 00:40:50.010
It's the same as
projecting once.

00:40:50.010 --> 00:40:55.110
So the projection matrix has the
property that P squared is P.

00:40:55.110 --> 00:40:57.730
And actually, we should
be able to see it

00:40:57.730 --> 00:41:01.600
if I write out this whole
miserable thing twice.

00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:04.590
So now I'm going to
be up to eight A's.

00:41:04.590 --> 00:41:09.320
Sorry about this, but I
promise not to do P cubed.

00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:13.250
A times (A transpose A) inverse
times A transpose, that's

00:41:13.250 --> 00:41:20.840
one P. I'll write it again.

00:41:20.840 --> 00:41:26.440
There's the second P.
So that's P squared.

00:41:26.440 --> 00:41:27.770
Do you see anything good there?

00:41:27.770 --> 00:41:33.110
Do you see in here A
transpose A, that combination

00:41:33.110 --> 00:41:35.980
and that combination there.

00:41:35.980 --> 00:41:39.880
This cancels that to
give the identity.

00:41:39.880 --> 00:41:42.500
And what am I left with?

00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:46.390
I'm left with A, the inverse
times A transpose, which

00:41:46.390 --> 00:41:51.530
was exactly P. The algebra
is just coming along

00:41:51.530 --> 00:41:54.930
with the understanding
that we know.

00:41:54.930 --> 00:41:58.580
So that's the projection matrix.

00:41:58.580 --> 00:42:03.880
So this is the theory of
projections in a nutshell,

00:42:03.880 --> 00:42:05.670
in a nutshell.

00:42:05.670 --> 00:42:08.780
This is projections onto
the column space of A.

00:42:08.780 --> 00:42:14.690
Now I have to remind you
about one little math point.

00:42:14.690 --> 00:42:16.350
Not so little, I guess.

00:42:16.350 --> 00:42:20.400
How could I say little for math?

00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:22.990
Is A transpose A invertible?

00:42:22.990 --> 00:42:26.790
We're plowing along
as if it is, that's

00:42:26.790 --> 00:42:28.490
going to be our assumption.

00:42:28.490 --> 00:42:31.170
But what's the condition
for A transpose A

00:42:31.170 --> 00:42:35.170
to be invertible, which
allows all this to work?

00:42:35.170 --> 00:42:43.120
When is A transpose
A invertible?

00:42:43.120 --> 00:42:46.960
What I'm doing here
now is I'm separating

00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:52.010
the positive definite one,
when A transpose A is positive

00:42:52.010 --> 00:42:56.850
definite, the good normal case
when all our equations work,

00:42:56.850 --> 00:43:01.450
from the semi-definite
one where we overlooked

00:43:01.450 --> 00:43:04.570
the fact that A transpose
A-- where somehow

00:43:04.570 --> 00:43:06.660
the experiment
wasn't well set up,

00:43:06.660 --> 00:43:12.180
we got an A transpose
A that is singular.

00:43:12.180 --> 00:43:15.470
And just to see, when
could that happen?

00:43:15.470 --> 00:43:20.450
Let me just remind you.

00:43:20.450 --> 00:43:21.270
This is important.

00:43:21.270 --> 00:43:26.730
Why don't I give it some space.

00:43:26.730 --> 00:43:28.810
It's really straightforward.

00:43:28.810 --> 00:43:34.780
Let me just go through
those steps again.

00:43:34.780 --> 00:43:42.650
If it's not invertible, if
some A transpose A u is zero.

00:43:42.650 --> 00:43:44.300
This is always the
risk that we have

00:43:44.300 --> 00:43:49.430
to check out and be sure we
don't have and understand.

00:43:49.430 --> 00:43:54.020
So if A transpose Au is zero,
then that would lead us,

00:43:54.020 --> 00:44:00.430
I could multiply both
sides by u transpose.

00:44:00.430 --> 00:44:03.310
u transpose zero, right?

00:44:03.310 --> 00:44:04.380
Safe.

00:44:04.380 --> 00:44:06.750
Multiply whatever
that u might be,

00:44:06.750 --> 00:44:09.090
multiply both sides
by u transpose.

00:44:09.090 --> 00:44:12.350
But what is u transpose zero?

00:44:12.350 --> 00:44:17.720
Zero, nothing there.

00:44:17.720 --> 00:44:20.680
Now how do I
understand this guy?

00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:22.130
Well you remember the key.

00:44:22.130 --> 00:44:24.040
Everybody remembers the key?

00:44:24.040 --> 00:44:26.680
You look at that
thing and you say hey,

00:44:26.680 --> 00:44:29.540
if I put in parentheses
in the right place that's

00:44:29.540 --> 00:44:34.410
the length of Au squared.

00:44:34.410 --> 00:44:38.500
So that's the small trick that
this multiplying by u transpose

00:44:38.500 --> 00:44:42.430
and then seeing what
you've got that we've done

00:44:42.430 --> 00:44:44.460
and you should know it.

00:44:44.460 --> 00:44:47.250
And now if the length squared
is zero, what does that

00:44:47.250 --> 00:44:48.340
tell me about Au?

00:44:51.290 --> 00:44:54.520
If I have a vector here
whose length is zero,

00:44:54.520 --> 00:44:56.740
that vector must be?

00:44:56.740 --> 00:44:57.920
Zero.

00:44:57.920 --> 00:45:01.620
Zero vector's the only one for
which the sum of the squares

00:45:01.620 --> 00:45:05.050
will give zero.

00:45:05.050 --> 00:45:08.480
And if Au is zero I
could multiply both sides

00:45:08.480 --> 00:45:14.590
by A transpose and
complete the loop.

00:45:14.590 --> 00:45:17.810
Actually I thought of that when
I was swimming this morning,

00:45:17.810 --> 00:45:21.540
that line.

00:45:21.540 --> 00:45:27.450
Just to see once again when,
it's sort of interesting then.

00:45:27.450 --> 00:45:30.620
A transpose Au equal zero
which is the bad thing

00:45:30.620 --> 00:45:34.780
we hope we don't deal with.

00:45:34.780 --> 00:45:36.360
And when does it happen?

00:45:36.360 --> 00:45:41.770
It happens when Au is zero.

00:45:41.770 --> 00:45:45.180
So our assumption
always has to be this,

00:45:45.180 --> 00:45:48.310
that there aren't any
u's, except the zero

00:45:48.310 --> 00:45:50.900
vector of course, that's
always going to happen,

00:45:50.900 --> 00:45:59.420
but we always have to assume
that Au is never zero.

00:45:59.420 --> 00:46:01.320
So we have to avoid this.

00:46:01.320 --> 00:46:12.880
So to avoid that assume A has
-- this is the key word --

00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:18.390
independent columns.

00:46:18.390 --> 00:46:21.260
Since this is a
combination of the columns,

00:46:21.260 --> 00:46:23.280
independent columns means what?

00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:26.150
It means that the only
combination of the columns

00:46:26.150 --> 00:46:31.150
to give zero is the
zero combination.

00:46:31.150 --> 00:46:34.040
So did I have independent
columns over here?

00:46:34.040 --> 00:46:35.490
I sure did.

00:46:35.490 --> 00:46:39.300
That column and that column were
off in different directions,

00:46:39.300 --> 00:46:40.640
they were independent.

00:46:40.640 --> 00:46:43.030
And that's why I
knew we were fine.

00:46:43.030 --> 00:46:46.190
A transpose A was zero.

00:46:46.190 --> 00:46:52.520
I would have to really
struggle to find a,

00:46:52.520 --> 00:46:56.210
well I'd have to think a
bit to find an example where

00:46:56.210 --> 00:46:58.520
we run into trouble.

00:46:58.520 --> 00:47:04.270
These squares, well I certainly
could in many applications,

00:47:04.270 --> 00:47:07.030
but the straightforward
applications

00:47:07.030 --> 00:47:09.490
of fitting a straight
line, A is going

00:47:09.490 --> 00:47:13.920
to be a column vector of ones
and a column vector of times

00:47:13.920 --> 00:47:20.460
and those are different
directions and no problem.

00:47:20.460 --> 00:47:23.290
So that's A transpose A.

00:47:23.290 --> 00:47:30.430
What else to do with this topic?

00:47:30.430 --> 00:47:33.220
Because there's a whole
world of estimation.

00:47:33.220 --> 00:47:38.490
I mean, statistics is looking
over our shoulder I guess.

00:47:38.490 --> 00:47:41.120
Really, we should realize
that a statistician

00:47:41.120 --> 00:47:46.270
is, say, yeah, I know that
but, and then going on.

00:47:46.270 --> 00:47:52.850
And what is that guy, what
more does he have to say?

00:47:52.850 --> 00:47:55.250
So you've got the central ideas.

00:47:55.250 --> 00:48:01.280
I guess the statistician
comes in in this, that's

00:48:01.280 --> 00:48:05.780
the statistical constant now.

00:48:05.780 --> 00:48:08.910
And what do
statisticians compute?

00:48:08.910 --> 00:48:14.840
They say you've
got errors, right?

00:48:14.840 --> 00:48:17.289
And of course, in
any particular case

00:48:17.289 --> 00:48:19.080
we don't know what that
error is, otherwise

00:48:19.080 --> 00:48:23.260
we could take it out and
we'd get exact solutions.

00:48:23.260 --> 00:48:25.550
We don't know what the error is.

00:48:25.550 --> 00:48:32.350
What is reasonable
to know about errors?

00:48:32.350 --> 00:48:43.190
We're doing a little
statistics here.

00:48:43.190 --> 00:48:45.760
Somehow that error,
that particular error

00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:49.550
of the experiment that we
happen to run, and if we ran it

00:48:49.550 --> 00:48:52.130
again we'd get a
different error,

00:48:52.130 --> 00:48:56.970
those errors come out of some
sort of error population.

00:48:56.970 --> 00:48:59.900
Like dark matter or something.

00:48:59.900 --> 00:49:03.740
Just like, a bunch of
errors are out there, noise.

00:49:03.740 --> 00:49:07.610
And what could we
reasonably assume

00:49:07.610 --> 00:49:09.950
that we know about the noise?

00:49:09.950 --> 00:49:14.840
We could assume that its
average is zero, mean zero.

00:49:14.840 --> 00:49:18.741
So statisticians always,
that just resets the meter.

00:49:18.741 --> 00:49:19.240
Right?

00:49:19.240 --> 00:49:23.000
If you had a meter or a clock
that was always three minutes

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:27.730
ahead (like this one)
you would reset it.

00:49:27.730 --> 00:49:30.380
And we'll do that one day.

00:49:30.380 --> 00:49:34.590
So you'd reset to
get the average zero.

00:49:34.590 --> 00:49:36.990
But that doesn't mean
every error is zero, right?

00:49:36.990 --> 00:49:39.910
That just means the
average error is zero.

00:49:39.910 --> 00:49:42.110
So what's the other number?

00:49:42.110 --> 00:49:46.170
What's the other number
that statisticians live on?

00:49:46.170 --> 00:49:48.420
It's the deviation
or its square,

00:49:48.420 --> 00:49:51.610
which is called the variance.

00:49:51.610 --> 00:49:52.250
Right.

00:49:52.250 --> 00:49:53.420
Variance.

00:49:53.420 --> 00:49:56.780
So that's the thing
that you could

00:49:56.780 --> 00:50:01.130
assume that the errors have mean
zero and have some variance.

00:50:01.130 --> 00:50:05.220
You could suppose that you knew
something about the variance.

00:50:05.220 --> 00:50:07.000
You don't know the
individual errors,

00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:14.270
but you know whether the
errors are like, are very small

00:50:14.270 --> 00:50:20.650
or close to zero or large.

00:50:20.650 --> 00:50:22.410
So this is a small variance.

00:50:22.410 --> 00:50:26.140
So one over sigma is
sort of that distance.

00:50:26.140 --> 00:50:27.220
One over sigma.

00:50:27.220 --> 00:50:33.270
Here, this is a
large variance where

00:50:33.270 --> 00:50:37.650
the magnitude of the error
could be much larger from this.

00:50:37.650 --> 00:50:39.940
So those are the two
numbers, mean zero,

00:50:39.940 --> 00:50:43.720
that leaves us just one
number, and the variance,

00:50:43.720 --> 00:50:48.040
the standard deviation sigma
or the variance sigma squared.

00:50:48.040 --> 00:50:55.050
One moment on these squares.

00:50:55.050 --> 00:50:58.770
Let me just say what the
weighting matrix would be.

00:50:58.770 --> 00:51:02.780
And then I can tell
you in a moment why.

00:51:02.780 --> 00:51:05.190
What would the
weighting matrix be

00:51:05.190 --> 00:51:09.910
if our three
equations, you know,

00:51:09.910 --> 00:51:11.895
that came from one
measurement and this

00:51:11.895 --> 00:51:13.520
came from a second
measurement and this

00:51:13.520 --> 00:51:14.940
came from a third measurement.

00:51:14.940 --> 00:51:18.670
If they came from
different meter readers

00:51:18.670 --> 00:51:21.830
with different
variances, suppose,

00:51:21.830 --> 00:51:28.270
then the right C matrix will be
a diagonal matrix, beautiful.

00:51:28.270 --> 00:51:34.060
And what sits up there, what
sits there, what sits there?

00:51:34.060 --> 00:51:36.660
We don't have spring
constants anymore.

00:51:36.660 --> 00:51:39.340
We have statistics constants.

00:51:39.340 --> 00:51:43.080
And what's the number
that goes there?

00:51:43.080 --> 00:51:45.340
That one is the third guy.

00:51:45.340 --> 00:51:49.410
So it's associated with
the third measurement.

00:51:49.410 --> 00:51:55.230
It's one over sigma_3 squared.

00:51:55.230 --> 00:51:57.720
Those are the numbers
that go on the diagonal,

00:51:57.720 --> 00:52:00.710
the inverses of the variances.

00:52:00.710 --> 00:52:03.360
And just to see that
that makes sense.

00:52:03.360 --> 00:52:11.430
If that number is unreliable,
if it has a large variance

00:52:11.430 --> 00:52:18.810
then I want to give it
little weight, right?

00:52:18.810 --> 00:52:21.840
If this third meter
is very unreliable

00:52:21.840 --> 00:52:23.840
I'm not going to
throw it out entirely,

00:52:23.840 --> 00:52:26.710
but I know that it's
variance is large

00:52:26.710 --> 00:52:31.990
and therefore I'll weight
that equation only a little,

00:52:31.990 --> 00:52:33.550
with a small weight.

00:52:33.550 --> 00:52:39.530
Suppose sigma_2, so this guy
is one over sigma_2 squared,

00:52:39.530 --> 00:52:44.570
suppose this is an
extremely reliable meter.

00:52:44.570 --> 00:52:48.100
That measurement has
little expected error.

00:52:48.100 --> 00:52:49.970
Then I want to
weight it heavily.

00:52:49.970 --> 00:52:56.800
So it has a small sigma_2 and
that gives it a large weight.

00:52:56.800 --> 00:52:58.580
And sigma_1 similarly.

00:52:58.580 --> 00:53:04.270
So that's the
weighting for the case

00:53:04.270 --> 00:53:08.770
that you can actually
hope to use in practice.

00:53:08.770 --> 00:53:11.820
I'll just mention that
statisticians would also

00:53:11.820 --> 00:53:13.620
say, wait a minute.

00:53:13.620 --> 00:53:17.350
Measurement two and measurement
three might be interconnected.

00:53:17.350 --> 00:53:19.290
They might not be independent.

00:53:19.290 --> 00:53:21.980
There might be a covariance.

00:53:21.980 --> 00:53:25.500
And then that gets them into
more great linear algebra

00:53:25.500 --> 00:53:26.360
actually.

00:53:26.360 --> 00:53:30.360
But if I want a
diagonal matrix C

00:53:30.360 --> 00:53:34.280
that's the case when my
measurements are independent.

00:53:34.280 --> 00:53:41.210
And basically, I'm
whitening the system.

00:53:41.210 --> 00:53:44.890
I'm making the system white,
making it all equal variances

00:53:44.890 --> 00:53:46.790
by rescaling.

00:53:46.790 --> 00:53:48.720
By weighting the equations.

00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:51.450
Okay, thanks.

00:53:51.450 --> 00:53:55.030
Wednesday is the
next big example

00:53:55.030 --> 00:53:57.830
of the framework with b and f.

00:53:57.830 --> 00:53:59.380
See you then.
